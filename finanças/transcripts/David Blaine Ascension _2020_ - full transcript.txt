>>THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN >>TELLING YOU ABOUT THAT I HAVE >>DREAMED OF SINCE YOUR AGE. >>AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS GRAB >>THAT RIG OF BALLOONS AND I WANT >>TO GO FLYING ALL THE WAY TO THE >>SKY UNTIL I BECOME A LITTLE DOT >>IN THE SKY THAT YOU WILL SEE. >>AND I WILL SEE? >> A LITTLE BLACK DOT. >> AND WHERE AM I GOING TO HEAD >>TOWARDS? >> VENUS. >> I HOPE SO. >> AND THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF >>YOU. >>I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING SINCE >>YOU WERE ONE YEARS OLD AND I >>STOPPED. >> SCARY THINGS. >> AND BECAUSE OF YOU COME I >>WANTED TO DO SOMETHING >>BEAUTIFUL. >> FREAKY. >> BECAUSE OF YOU WHOM I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT I'M DOING THAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND THAT IS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU. IT IS TRUE. >> THANK YOU. >> EVER SINCE I WAS A KID, I DREAMED OF FLYING. WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD, MY MOM TOOK ME TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT A BOY THAT FLEW DOMINIC FLOATS AWAY ON A BUNCH OF BALLOONS. MY INSPIRING OF LOVE OF LEVITATION AND MAGIC FOR SURE. I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT IMAGE, AND NOW, I AM GOING TO MAKE IT A REALITY BY HOLDING ON TO A BUNCH OF BALLOONS AND FLYING AS HIGH AS I CAN POSSIBLY GO. EVERY SINGLE STOP THAT I HAVE EVER DONE IS ABOUT ENDURANCE AND PUSHING PAST WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY PEOPLE WOULD EVER DREAM OF DOING THAT. MY DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD. IT WAS SO DIFFICULT AND EXTREME THAT I DECIDED RIGHT THEN AND THERE, I WOULD FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD INSPIRE HER AND NOT SCARE HER. EVEN THOUGH THIS SEEMS LIKE EVERY KID'S DREAM, ASCENSION IS THE MOST AMBITIOUS PERFORMANCE OF MY LIFE. THANKS TO MY TEAMMATE MY YOUTUBE COME I HAVE ASSEMBLED THE BEST EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD LED BY THE ELITE SKYDIVER AND CRAZIEST DAREDEVIL I HAVE EVER MET, LUKE AIKINS. I HAVE THE WORLD'S LEADING WEATHER EXPERTS, BALLOONIST AND A REAL ENGINEERS WORKING ON THIS ALL OF WHOM ARE CRITICAL ON HELPING ME PULL THIS OFF. >> WE HAVE NEVER DESIGNED ANYTHING LIKE THIS LIGHTER THAN AIR OUTDOORS, ET CETERA. THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY WILD AND FUN EXPERIENCE FOR US. >> IN ORDER TO DO THIS, I HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO SKYDIVE. >> THAT WAS SO GOOD! >> I ALSO BECAME A COMMERCIAL BALLOON PILOT WITH THE ABILITY TO FLY IN THE HELIUM-FILLED BALLOONS. >> THERE ARE A LOT OF CRITICAL MOMENTS IN THIS PROJECT THAT DAVID HAS TO WORK ON. >> TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THE PARACHUTE ON ONCE I'M UP AT 5,000 FEET. >> SWITCH, NO, NO, NOT THIS! >> IF HE DOESN'T PUT ON HIS PARACHUTE, HE DIES. A CATASTROPHIC COAL MOVE, DAVE WILL COME CRASHING DOWN TO EART. >> AND NOW WE HAVE MOVED TO PAGE, ARIZONA. AND I HAVE NEVER HAD TO LAND ON TERRAIN THIS DIFFICULT IN MY LIFE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M SO EXCITED TO PULL THIS OFF. >> I CAN'T BELIEVE TODAY IS FINALLY HERE. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND DREAMING ABOUT THIS OVER A DECADE. THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST EXCITING PROJECT THAT I HAVE EVER PUT TOGETHER IN MY LIFE. AND THE BEST PART IS I HAVE ACTUALLY PUT THE MOST INCREDIBLE TEAM TOGETHER TO HELP ME DO THIS SO I DON'T DIE. THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE, AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME OF MY TEAM. SOME OF THE BEST EXPERTS IN THE SO COME WITH ME. WORLD. LUKE. SO THIS IS LUKE AIKINS WHO HAS TAUGHT ME HOW TO JUMP OUT OF PLANE SAFELY, HOW TO LAND IN THE IN AREA SAFELY COMMAND ACTUALLY PUT THE ENTIRE STUNT TOGETHER. HE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THE REASON I FOUND LUKE IS BECAUSE HE WAS THAT GUY THAT JUMPED 25,000 FEET OUT OF AN AIRPLANE WITHOUT A PARACHUTE AND LANDED INTO A TINY NET. FROM UP THERE, YOU CAN'T SEE IT. IT LOOKS LIKE A TINY DOT. SO THIS IS LUKE. >> ARE YOU EXCITED? >> I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS FINALLY GOING TO HAPPEN. >> I START TO GET GOOSE BUMPS THE MORE I TALK ABOUT IT. >> EVERYBODY IS IN POSITION AND THE WEATHER IS GREAT. >> LUKE HAS NOT SLEPT IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS. WE ARE HERE. IT IS GAME DAY. IT IS ALL UP TO YOU NOW. >> AND THE BEST YOUTUBE OR WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT TECH THAT DOES EVERY SINGLE GREAT VIDEO THAT EXPLAINS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. MARK HAS DECIDED TO COME HELP US WITH IT. HE WILL BE THE EYES FOR YOU HE WILL EXPLAIN EVERY QUESTION GUYS. YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU, MARK. >> THAT IS THE PLAN. THERE IS A LOT OF TECH BEHIND THIS AND I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT UNTIL THEY SEE IT. I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING BECAUSE WE ARE HERE AND NOW. THIS IS A CHILDHOOD DREAM YEARS AND YEARS OF TRAINING BUT WE ARE HERE ON THE DAY NOW. HOW DOES THAT FEEL? >> I WON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING UNTIL MY FEET START LIFTING UP OFF OF THE GROUND AND KEEP GOING. HOW DOES THIS DIFFER FROM YOUR >> IT IS AMAZING. OTHER PROJECTS? IT IS SUPER DIFFERENT, BUT WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFERENT? >> THIS IS THE FIRST PROJECT I HAVE EVER DONE AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU TWO. THAT I'M ACTUALLY ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THE DREAM TEAM THAT IS ALL AROUND ME. AND I COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER. SO EVEN THOUGH THE IDEA SEEMS SO SIMPLE, IT IS LIKE I WILL HOLD A BUNCH OF BALLOONS AND BECOME A DOT IN THE SKY BUT THERE'S A LOT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN SAFELY AND LEGALLY. IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UP TO THIS MOMENT. >> THAT IS TRUE. I HAVE WITNESSED IT. LUKE YOU HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF ESSENTIALLY A TON OF THE PROJECT, AND YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST RISK FACTORS BUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS TO PAY MOST ATTENTION TO? >> I HAVE A LIST A MILE LONG BUT I HAVE FOUR BASICS. TEMPERATURE, IT IS GOING TO BE COLD. FREEZING 25,000 FEET WERE HIGHER. YOU HAVE HYPOXIA, LACK OF OXYGEN. YOU COULD BE ARGUING WITH ME. OR GET SILLY, IT IS ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE IMPERATIVE. >> SO SHORT MERRILY DRUNK IS WHAT HAPPENS. >> AND FOR ME, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES IS I WAS TALKING TO DAVID, AND I HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL LOOK. I DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR A PARACHUTE. DUDE, YOU HAVE TO WEAR A PARACHUTE. HE SAID TO COME IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO. AND I SAID I DON'T THINK SO. >> MAYBE WE COULD HIDE IT TO END THE BALLOONS. >> HE JUMPED ON IT, LET'S DO THAT IS WHAT I'M DOING. THAT. WAIT A MINUTE. IT GETS REALLY COLD. YOU HAVE A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON. I DON'T WANT TO ADD ANOTHER THING. I STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT AND I TOOK MY 8-YEAR-OLD KID AND HUNG IT IN MY HANGAR, STARTED MESSING AROUND. I CALLED DAVID, HEY, I THINK WE CAN DO THIS. >> LOGAN PULLED IT OFF FIRST. SO THEN WE GOT THE PARACHUTE ON AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME IS THE SAFE LANDING. AND WE ARE OUT HERE. IT IS SKETCH BALL. YOU KNOW, THERE IS SOME BEAUTIFUL LANDING SPOTS AND SOME REALLY BAD ONCE. >> WEEP AND THE BEAUTIFUL ONES FOR YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT FOR ME MY MEANT 400. >> I'M SURE FROM THAT HEIGHT IT IS A LOT TO LOOK AT. I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE EXPERTS. >> BUT WAIT I WANT TO SAVE ONE OTHER THING WE FORGOT AND THIS IS THE TRUTH. I'VE NEVER GONE UP ABOVE A FEW HUNDRED FEET BASICALLY. WITH THE ENTIRE -- I'VE DONE A FEW FLIGHTS, BUT I'VE NEVER DONE THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM ONCE. SO THE FIRST TIME I PUT ON THE PARACHUTE UP IN THE AIR AND THE FIRST TIME I GO TO THESE HEIGHTS WILL BE LIVE RIGHT HERE. THE FIRST TIME EVER! IT IS A TRUE TEST. AND THAT IS THE TRUTH. >> WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE YOU WERE PRACTICING GETTING THE PARACHUTE ON BUT YOU WERE 10 FEET OFF OF THE GROUND. THIS IS A TRUE FIRST OF EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. >> ALSO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS UP THERE WHEN IT GETS FREEZING COLD. WHAT IF I CAN'T FEEL MY FINGERS? >> WE WILL GET TO ALL OF THAT >> WE ARE ALL GOOD. BUT I TALKED ALL THE EXPERTS BEHIND THE SCENES THAT PUT ALL THIS TEXT TOGETHER. SO LET'S CHECK THAT OUT. >> SO THESE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS, I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BASICALLY WITNESS THIS ENTIRE PROJECT COME TOGETHER IN THIS PLACE. IT STARTED SUPER SIMPLE. THE IDEA IS IT IS DAVID, THE BALLOONS, FLOATING AWAY, DISAPPEARING IN THE SKY. EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO GO TOGETHER AROUND IT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE AND SAFE. AND SO WHAT THE RESULT IS IS AN INCREDIBLE A-TEAM OF ALL THE EXPERTS IN AVIATION, BALLOON, SKYDIVING ALL HERE. SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND MEET THE TEAM. >> DUDE, SO FUN. >> LUKE AIKEN IS A WORLD IN A REALIST EXPERT ON THE TEAM. >> WHY DO THEY HAVE YOU WITH ALL THE TECH RIGHT NOW? FOR SOME REASON I WOULD DO THE TESTING. BUT DAVID IS GETTING BUSY READY TO PRACTICE AND HANGING AND YOU CAN'T BE TWO PLACES AT ONCE. SO I WILL DO A JUMP ON THE TESTING EQUIPMENT TO MAKE SURE IT IS WORKING RIGHT. >> WHAT IS IT LIKE HAVING THE SUPERHERO TEAM WITH NUMBER ONE SKYDIVING EXPERT, THE BALLOONING EXPERTS, THE WEATHER EXPERT? DOES THAT SEEM LIKE THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO? IT IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE HORIZON AND THAT BEING THIS IMAGE OF CHILDLIKE WONDER, EVEN WITH ALL THIS TECH HERE, IT WILL LOOK LIKE DAVID GRABS A BUNCH OF BALLOONS AND FLOATS AWAY. IF IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, WHY WOULD WE DO IT? MARK THOMPSON, AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. >> WHEN WE DO TEST FLIGHTS COME EVERYBODY THINKS WE ARE TRAINING DAVID. WE ARE ACTUALLY TRAINING GROUND CREW BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING HOW TO LOOK -- LEARNING HOW TO WORK TOGETHER. TEAMWORK AND SCIENCE. HE IS A THIRD-GENERATION BALLOON AVIATION EXPERT. WHAT IS THE BASIC QUESTION FOR YOU? >> THERE IS A NUMBER OF LITTLE STEPS ALONG THE WAY BEFORE HE CUTS HIMSELF LOOSE THAT I WILL BE BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF ON. >> DON DAY IS MAKING THE FINAL LUNCH. >> WHAT IS YOUR PREDICTION FOR THE LAUNCH? IT WILL ACTUALLY COOL OFF IN THE DESERT SO EVERYTHING IS LOOKING GOOD. >> FINGERS ARE CROSSED. >> IT IS LOOKING GOOD. >> AMAZING, HEY, LUKE CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SECOND. JIM, YOU ARE IN CHARGE WITH THE PAYLOAD SO FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS A LOT WE ARE LOOKING AT. WE ARE LITTLE WHILE FROM LAUNCH. WHERE ARE WE IN THE PROCESS? WE ARE ONE HOUR FROM LAUNCH AND WE GOT HERE SIX HOURS AGO. INFLATING BALLOONS FOR SOME OTHER TEAM MEMBERS TO START INSTALLING SQUIBS ON THEM. WE WAITED FOR THE WINTER CALMED DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND ASSEMBLED THE CLUSTER. >> YOU SAID THE WORD "SQUIB" AND WHAT IS A SQUIB? IS THIS A SQUIB? >> SO THESE ARE ELECTRONIC MAPS TAPE TO EACH BALLOON IN DIFFERENT ORDERS LIKE A BUNCH OR A FEW. BALLOONS WHICH MEANS WE POP THE THIS WILL ACTUALLY PREVENT THE BALLOONS AND IT LETS IT COME DOWN. >> IT IS A REMOTE CONTROL BALLOON POP TRIGGER. >> BEAUTIFUL. >> I COULDN'T SAY IT BETTER MYSELF. SO YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF THE GO/NO-GO CHECKLIST AS YOU MENTIONED BUT WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS HAVE WE MADE ON THE LIST SO FAR? >> IT IS A BIG LIST. WE LIMITED IT TO THE TEAM CAPTAINS. WE HAVE WEATHER MOST IMPORTANT. A SEQUENCE CHEMICAL WEAPON ARE WE HAVE THE SAFETY TEAM, WE ALLOWED TO TAKE OFF? PARACHUTE GUYS, WHETHER, A MASSIVE LIST AND WE WILL BE READY WHEN IT'S DONE. >> OKAY. I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON THE SORT OF MAGICAL BALLOON. THAT I CAN'T HELP BUT LOOK AT BECAUSE I AM A TECH GUY. INSIDE THE BLOWN CLUSTER THERE IS ONE SPECIAL BALLOON THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT. >> WE CALL IT THE PAYLOAD AND ACTUALLY STARTING TO MAKE DISAPPEAR RIGHT NOW SO WHEN WE GO UP, WE DON'T HAVE A TECH CATALOG ABOVE DAVID THE PURITY WE WANT TO KEEP THAT SENSE OF CHILDLIKE WONDER BUT THE A.C.T. CLEARANCE AND ALL THE ELECTRONICS TO GET THE CAMERAS AND SIGNALS AND ALL THE SIGNALS BACK. >> I HAVE SEEN THE INSIDE OF IT AND IT IS LIKE A PC INSIDE OF A BALLOON IS CENTRALLY. THE PREVIOUS VERSION ACTUALLY OVERHEATED. IT IS 1 MILLION DEGREES IN THE DESERT. WHAT PRECAUTIONS HAVE YOU GUYS TAKEN WITH THIS NEW VERSION TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN? >> A BUNCH OF THINGS AND HVAC SYSTEM. WE HAVE ALSO PUT MORE HOLES IN THE SHELL OF THE BALLOON, WHICH ALLOWS FOR MORE AIRFLOW. AND WE ADJUSTED SOME OF THE DESIGN OF SOME OF THE PLATES THAT ALL OF THAT STUFF IS MOUNTED TO FOR BETTER EATING AND ELEMENTS AROUND IT. >> SO YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN IN THIS FOR LIKE TWO YEARS AND SPEAK ABOUT EVERY LITTLE DETAIL BUT WE HAVE A PIECE FOR EVERYONE TO GET CAUGHT UP ON WHAT'S GOING DOWN. CHECK IT OUT. >> THIS FACILITY IS REALLY UNBELIEVABLE. THEY BUILT EVERY RIG FOR EVERY SHOW. THEY BUILT THE CIRCUS STAGES. THAT LOOKS AWESOME. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS A LEGAL AIRCRAFT, WE HAVE TO CREATE A FIBERGLASS BALLOON THAT HAS ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE WOULD NEED. IT HAS A TRANSPONDER. IT HAS OXYGEN THAT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE THIS LEGAL. IS IT IS ALSO GOING TO HAVE A PARACHUTE, AND IT HAS EVERYTHING WE NEED TO TRANSMIT AUDIO AND VIDEO BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND. IT WILL LOOK JUST LIKE A BALLOON. THAT WILL FIT RIGHT INSIDE OF IT. >> ENTIRE POINT OF THIS IS TO NOT HAVE IT LOOK LIKE THERE IS A WHOLE RIGGING CATALOG HANGING ABOVE DAVID, BUT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S WALKING UP AND GRABBING A BUNCH OF BALLOONS AND TAKING OFF IN THE AIR AND HAVEN'T WORKED EVERY SINGLE TIME BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE DAVID BLAINE AND WE WILL ONLY DO THIS 226 POUNDS. >> PAYLOAD CLOCKS AND ONCE. SO MOST OF THE BALLOONS ARE JUST TO GET THE PAYLOAD TO BE NEUTRALLY PLANTED APPEAR THE REST OF THE BLENDS ARE TO GET DAVID TO BE NEUTRALLY PLANTED AD ONE OR TWO KOBO BALLOONS. IN RIGGING, ALL OF THE BALLOONS AND THEN DAVID IS HANGING BELOW ARE CONNECTING TO IT. THAT. THIS SITE HERE IS WHAT PAYS THE BILLS. THIS IS FOR THE CAMERA SYSTEM. SO IT WILL TAKE ALL OF THE COOL IMAGES THAT ARE BEING SENT DOWN AND RELAYED THEM UP THROUGH AN AIRPLANE THAT ENCIRCLING OFTEN THE DISTANCE THE DISTANCE AND RELATING THAT DOWN LIVE. THROUGH SOME SORT OF MAGIC THAT GOES ACROSS THE INTERNET WHILE IT IS HAPPENING. BECAUSE THIS IS THE DEVICE THAT HAS ALL OF THE SAFETY STUFF ON IT. THESE ARE WHAT THE REAL BALLOONS WILL LOOK LIKE. THIS IS WHAT ALL OF THIS STUFF IS GOING TO GO IN. >> I HAVE ANOTHER FREE HAND. READY? ALL OF THESE BALLOONS ARE FOR POP UP POP UP. >> WOW! THEY ARE REALLY BIG. THE BALLOONS >> LOOK, I'M WALKING THROUGH THEM. PICO IT IS A TON OF BALLOONS. LET'S GO PUT IT TOGETHER. HOLD ON. >> OKAY. LOVE YOU. >> SO I'M HERE WITH SOME OF THE EXPERT TEAM THAT MAKES THIS EACH ONE OF THEM HAS THEIR OWN POSSIBLE. SUPER HIGH LEVEL EXPERTISE, BUT YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM. I WANT TO START WITH YOU, ART THOMPSON. OR IT IS SINCE ESSENTIALLY IN CHARGE OF PAYLOAD AND AVIATION CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT IS ENGINEERING. INSIDE SPECIFICALLY THE PAYLOAD? >> INSIDE WE HAVE SEED TO COMMAND AND CONTROL OF THE RADIOS. THE PRIMARY BACKUP. THE SAME THING FOR UNIVERSITIES OR INSTRUMENTAL FLIGHTS, AND RESEARCH LAB. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT SENDS SIGNALS FOR DROPPING WEIGHT WHICH GIVES US WITH WERE VENTING BALLOONS, POPPING BALLOONS. WHICH ALLOWS US. SO NORMALLY WE WOULD USE THE VALVE WHICH WOULD EVENT, IN THIS CASE, SQUIBS THAT ACTUALLY POP THE BALLOON. >> THIS IS SOMETHING I REALLY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT UNTIL I GOT HERE AND THOUGHT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. DAVE AND CONTROLS THE BLENDS ON THE WAY UP. HE JUMPS FROM THEM. THAT PAYLOAD IS STILL FLOATING AND NEEDS TO BE COME A KIND OF LIKE GETTING OUT OF A CAR WITH A DRIVER NOT IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. THIS APPARATUS WILL HELP YOU CONTROL AND EVENTUALLY GET IT DOWN? >> SO WE ARE SENDING SIGNALS, IN AN CODED SIGNAL ON A MILITARY CHANNEL SO THERE IS A LOT TO BE DONE THAT REALLY MAKES THE CALL TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE JET STREAMS ARE APPEARING SO WE CAN FLIGHT UP TO GET IT AWAY OR BRING IT DOWN. THAT IS OUR WAY OF CONTROLLING IT. >> GOTCHA. I SHOULD TALK TO YOU, DON. LET'S TALK WEATHER. I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY DON DAY NUMBER ONE MAN IN THE WORLD, WHETHER MAN IN THE WORLD. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BALLOONS, THE NATURAL BIGGEST WEATHER IS THE WIND, RIGHT? >> BALLOONS ARE SUPER SENSITIVE TO WIND AND DAVID'S LAUNCH WHEN SPEEDS OF 5 MILES AN HOUR OR LESS. MOST PEOPLE CAN'T FEEL 5 MILES AN HOUR BUT WE HAVE TO BE LESS THAN THAT WHERE THE BALLOONS GET UNCONTROLLABLE. A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS WEEKEND WHEN WE TRIED TO PUT YOU IN THE TETHER FROM IT WAS 8 MILES AN HOUR. THAT WAS TOO FAST AND TOO DANGEROUS. >> I REMEMBER THAT. I WAS TRYING TO EXPERIENCE WHAT HE WAS GOING TO EXPERIENCE AND WE COULDN'T GET IN THE BALLOONS AND DO IT BECAUSE 8 MILES AN HOUR WAS WHIPPING HIM ALL OVER THE PLACE WHICH IS CRAZY. I'M STANDING OUT HERE AND IT'S FEELING LIKE WE HAVE GOOD CONDITIONS, EARLY IN THE MORNING WHICH FROM WHAT I CAN TELL IS GOOD FOR WIND. >> ABSOLUTELY, BALLOON OPERATIONS ARE BEST IN THE MORNING WHEN IT IS COOL, THEY WERE A STAPLE. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD AN AIR FRONT COME THROUGH ARIZONA YESTERDAY AND GOT WINDY BUT 10 DEGREES COOLER THIS MORNING. IT FEELS WONDERFUL. AND I SCHOOL MORNING. >> YOU SET UP A TEST BALLOONS THIS MORNING. HOW DID THAT GO? WE MENTIONED THEY ARE VERY SLOW. AND AS DAVID ASCENDS NICE AND SLOW, THE WINDS VARIABLE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE UNTIL HE GETS HIGHER UP AS THE WIND SPEEDS INCREASE BEFORE HE WILL START TO MOVE VERY MUCH. >> GOTCHA. THE LAST PERSON I WANT TO INTRODUCE OVER HERE IS BERT. BERT, WHEN YOU DO THESE BALLOON THINGS, YOU NEED ESSENTIALLY THE NUMBER ONE BALLOONING EXPERT IN THE WORLD SO HAPPY YOU ARE HERE AS WELL. AND WE TALK ABOUT -- >> AND BE UNHAPPY. TAKING ME THROUGH BALLOONING STEP-BY-STEP. >> IT IS AMAZING. >> A GREAT MEMBER OF THE TEAM AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BALLOON CLUSTER I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING FLY LIKE THIS BEFORE BUT THERE IS A LOT OF VARIABLES. WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN? >> IT IS SURFACED WHEN SPIRIT NEED NICE CALM WINDS THIS MORNING. AND IF IT WERE ME SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW I WOULD WANT TO BE AND THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. >> WOULD YOU ALSO WANT TO JUMP AGAIN? >> I NEVER HAVE, DAVID. [LAUGHTER] >> SO HE MENTIONED THE PAYLOAD IS ABLE TO POP BALLOONS AND DROP WEIGHT. WHY ARE WE DOING THAT? HOW DOES THAT WORK? >> SO WITH THE GAS BALLOON TO GO UP, YOU RELEASE WEIGHT THAT ALLOWS THE BALLOON TO GO UP TO POP BALLOONS, DECREASING THE WEIGHT. EACH BALLOON HAS A LIFT OF 15 POUNDS SO YOU POP THE BALLOON. YOU ARE A 15 HEAVY. >> WE HAVE 60 POUNDS OF SAND. SO IF, FOR SOME REASON, I LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS, WHICH I MOST LIKELY WILL NOT BUT IF I DO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS, HE CAN BASICALLYE UP WHICH HE WOULDN'T BY DUMPING THE SAND. OR HE CAN REMOTE BRING ME DOWN AND FOR CONTROL THAT THEY WILL AS WELL. HAVE OVER THE BALLOON IF I COULDN'T FUNCTION IS THEY BASICALLY BETWEEN HIM AND DON CAN LOOK AT THE WIND. THE WINDOWS LIKE A RIVER. THE WIND AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES MOVES YOU A DIFFERENT DIRECTION SO THEY CAN PUT ME WHERE I NEED TO INTO A DIFFERENT RIVER WENT WHICH IS A CURRENT TAKE ME WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. >> SO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BLENDING MORE THAN I DO. EXCELLENT. WE HAVE A POLICE TO SHOW YOU AND THIS HERCULEAN EFFORT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SO WE WANT TO PUT TOGETHER A PIECE OF THE SHOW TO SHOW YOU HOW THAT HAS GONE. TAKE A LOOK. >> IN ORDER TO PULL THIS PROJECT OFF I DISCOVER THE BALLOONS I WILL BE FLYING WILL HE DID CLASSIFIED AS AN EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT. IN ANY AIRCRAFT A LICENSED PILOT TO FLY IT SO THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO BECOME PEER THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO FLY UP INTO THE SKY WITH BALLOONS. USING EITHER HOT AIR TO FORCE IT UP OR CAST SUCH AS HYDROGEN THAT RISES NATURALLY. MOST PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO FLY BALLOONS AND A HOT AIR METHOD SO THAT'S WHERE I STARTED. >> 6:15. >> GOING UP AND DOWN IN A BALLOON IS PRETTY SIMPLE. HOWEVER, IT INTENTIONALLY FLYING IT IN ANY GIVEN DIRECTION IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. THE BEST PILOTS IN THE WORLD HAVE A TOUCH AND FINESSE THAT IS UNRIVALED. IT WAS THESE PILOTS THAT I SOUGHT OUT TO INSTRUCT ME AND TEACH ME WHAT THEY KNOW. >> THIS WILL TELL US A LOT ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT GOES STRAIGHT UP. EXACTLY LIKE YOU SAY. ♪ ♪ SPEAK WITH THE FIRST LESSONS HOW TO SAFELY BUILD AN INFLATABLE BALLOON AND ALL OF ITS RIGGING. >> OKAY, CHECK AIR IN THIS REGISTRATION, FLIGHT MANUAL, WHICH WE DID. >> HAVE A SAFE FLIGHT. >> NEXT I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO FLY HIGH AND VERY LOW. I HAD TO LAND AND PLAN AND UNPLANNED LOCATIONS. >> GOOD JOB. THAT WAS A SAFE LANDING. >> AND BRING IT DOWN IN ROUGH WINS. WHEN SPWINS. WE HAVE TO PULL ALL OF THE AIR OUT OF THE ENVELOPE. OTHER THAN HITTING POWER LINES, THAT IS AS BAD AS IT GETS. HE DID GOOD, HE DID REALLY GOOD TO. >> AFTER I MASTERED THE ART OF FLYING WITH HEAT MY REACHED OUT TO THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GAS BALLOON PILOT IN THE WORLD, BERT. BERT HELP ME TO GET CERTIFIED SO I CAN FLY LIGHTER THAN AIR BALLOONS. >> WELL WHAT YOU ARE DOING DOWN THE ROAD IS LITTLE DIFFERENT, THIS IS GOOD TRAINING. I THINK IT WILL COME BACK AND YOU WILL THINK ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU ARE DOING IT. >> UNLIKE HOT AIR WHICH IS NOISY, GAS BALLOONING IS COMPLETELY SILENT ON ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCES I HAVE EVER HAD. YOU ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PART OF THE WIND AS YOU MOVE ALONG WITHOUT ANY SOUND WHATSOEVER. >> IT IS STILL. WOW! LEARNING TO FLY BALLOONS HAS EXCEEDED ALL OF MY WILDEST EXPECTATIONS. NOW THAT I AM AN OFFICIALLY LICENSED BALLOON PILOTS, I CANNOT WAIT TO FLY MY AIRCRAFT. >> ALL RIGHT, WE ARE STILL ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO FROM LUNCH WHICH SELFISHLY ASK DAVID BLAINE TO GIVES ME ENOUGH TIME TO GIVE ME ONE OF HIS SECRET MAGIC TRICKS. IS THAT COOL? I WILL SHOW YOU MY FAVORITE CARD TRICK AND I WILL GIVE THIS CARD TO MY BROTHER. >> OKAY, COOL. >> MY BROTHER IS OBSESSED WITH MARQUES. HE WAS SO EXCITED BUT HE SAW MARQUES AND SAID -- BUT HERE, THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE. ANY CARD THAT YOU WANT, YOU CAN HELP. TAKE ONE OUT. >> OKAY, GOT IT. >> CAN YOU WRITE YOUR NAME SO >> BIG AND BOLD SO IT IS VISIBLE >> ANYWHERE? EVERYBODY CAN SEE IT? SO YOU CAN SEE YOUR NAME. SO IT MIGHT BE ON THE BORDER. >> YOU SEE THAT? >> GREAT. >> CAN YOU ALL SEE THAT? NOW LOOK DO YOU SEE HOW THE CARD, IT LOOKS LIKE I PUT YOUR CARD, FOR REAL, INSIDE, YES? >> YES. >> NO, I DID THIS ONE MOVE AND YOU SEE IT'S RIGHT ON TOP JUST LIKE THAT. CAN YOU SEE THAT? BUT NO, HOLD ON THAT IS SIMPLE MAGIC, RIGHT? HOLD YOUR HAND PALM UP AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO. PUT YOUR OTHER HAND ON TOP OF IT FLAT. LIKE THAT. AND I ALSO USE THIS CARD SO WE USE A DEUCE OF HEARTS, RIGHT? WATCH WHAT I DO WITH THE TWO. YOU CAN ALL SEE IF I TAKE THE TWO AND PLACE IT ABOVE YOUR HAND AND I DID THIS. OH, YEAH, I HAVE YOUR CARD. >> WHAT? OKAY. THAT'S -- YEAH, THIS IS WHY PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE ALL THIS STUFF. IT IS DAVID BLAINE. IT WILL JUST BE ANOTHER TRICK MANNER. BUT THAT IS REAL MAGIC. BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT IS A NATURAL SEGUE TO THE PHYSICS THING. BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE DOING MAGIC IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND ART, BUT DESPITE THIS ALSO BEING BEAUTIFUL AND ART, THERE ARE SO MUCH MATH AND PHYSICS TO MAKE IT SAFE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO LIKE A CHOICE BETWEEN HELIUM AND HYDROGEN BALLOONS FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE A PIECE YOU WERE TALKING TO DIANA, THE PHYSICS GIRL, FELLOW YOUTUBE FRIEND OF OURS AND WE TALK ABOUT THE CHOICES YOU HAVE TO MAKE. SO LET'S ROLLED OUT. ROLE THAT.>> WHAT I'M HERE DO YE THAT CHANGES OR CONTROL HOW MUCH YOU ARE GOING UP OR DOWN? >> I HAVE NO IDEA. [LAUGHTER] SO I BROUGHT SOME EXPENSE I WANT TO SHOW YOU TO TALK ABOUT THE P. BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THE PRESSURE GETS WAY LOWER. I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN EXPERIMENT TO TALK ABOUT THAT COME ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE AIR GETS THINNER. >> OKAY. >> THIS IS A VACUUM CHAMBER. AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO BLOW THIS BALLOON UP. I AM GOING TO TELL YOU IT. OKAY. SO I WILL TIE THE VACUUM PUMP ON. THAT LITTLE BALLOON AT THE BOTTOM IS THE ONE THAT I DIDN'T >> IT IS STARTING TO EXTEND BUT >> NOTHING TO. BLOW ON AT ALL. THESE ALREADY HAVE SO MUCH GAS IN IT. >> SO COOL. THE REASON I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN I SAW THESE MASSIVE BALLOONS IS THE FACT THAT THESE WILL EXPAND. THEY WILL GO FROM 8 FEET DIAMETER TO ABOUT 10 FEET. BECAUSE THEY DO THE SAME THING AS THESE BALLOONS. SO THERE IS MORE DRAG ON THEM. THEY ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT GO WANT TO. >> THEY WILL LOOK BIGGER BUT THE ISSUE IS IF THEY START POPPING. THAT IS A REAL -- >> IF THEY ARE CLOSER TOGETHER AND TOUCHING. >> WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR BLOOD? >> SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THING BUT WE HAVE AN EXPERIMENT FOR THAT IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT. OKAY, YES. I WAS CURIOUS WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE GOING UP HOW FAST YOU ARE GOING AND HOW HIGH YOU ARE GOING BECAUSE THAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU WOULD GET DEPRESSION SICKNESS. BECAUSE THERE IS SOME FLUID IN HERE. I WILL PULL IT BACK AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I WILL HAVE YOU GUESSED. HERE WE GO. SO YOU CAN SEE IT CONTINUING TO BUBBLE. I'M JUST HOLDING IT HERE AND IS CONTINUING TO BUBBLE. >> LIKE CARBONATED WATER. IS THAT WHAT IT DOES? >> YES, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. SO YOU PULL IT BACK AND ALL OF THE FLUID, YOU LET IT GO WHEN IT STOPS. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BLOOD. >> MORE WITH DIVERS. A DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS BECAUSE YOU GO DOWN AND THE MORE PRESSURE YOU ARE UNDER, THE MORE YOU CAN GET NITROGEN DISSOLVED INTO YOUR BLOOD. I MEAN I'M A THIS IS A QUICK AND DRASTIC PRESSURE CHANGE SO WITH THAT HAPPEN TO YOU. >> THAT IS BETTER. >> THAT WOULD BE REALLY BAD. >> THIS IS 17 POUNDS OF LITITZ. IF YOU FEEL THIS. >> SO HARD TO PULL. THAT IS INCREDIBLE. SO BASICALLY, IF I HAD SEVEN BALLOONS, YOU WOULD BE GOOD TO GO. >> SEVEN OR EIGHT BALLOONS? THAT IS SO COOL. SO YOU ARE USING HELIUM WHICH IS A GREAT GAS WERE FLYING BALLOONS, BUT HYDROGEN GIVES YOU A BIT MORE LIFT BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSE. >> HELIUM IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO COME BY, MORE COSTLY. >> I WANT TO DO A DEMONSTRATION WITH YOU. AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHY YOU ARE USING HELIUM AND NOT HYDROGEN END. >> SO WE HAVE SOME HAND SANITIZER WRAPPED AROUND A STICK. >> THAT IS GOING. >> TEST NUMBER ONE, HELIUM. [LAUGHTER] >> BASICALLY WHAT WE EXPECTED. >> WAS THAT ONE CLAP I HEARD OVER THEY ARE? >> NOW, WE ARE GOING TO DO THE HYDROGEN TEST. [LAUGHTER] >> WE DID IT! SO THAT IS WHY YOU AVOID HYDROGEN, BOOM! >> WOW! >> THAT IS AWESOME. >> THAT IS AWESOME. THANK YOU. >> LUKE, WE ARE ABOUT HOW LONG FROM LAUNCH DO YOU THINK? >> ABOUT AN HOUR. IT IS STARTING TO GET SERIOUS NOW. WE ARE AND IT. >> I WANT TO GO OVER THE MAIN RISK FACTOR YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING. WHICH IS HYPOXIA, TEMPERATURE, PARACHUTE, AND LANDING. MET WITH I'M GUESSING AT HOME, PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT MEDIA THING IS HYPOXIA BUT DO Y? >> HYPOXIA IS A REAL DEAL. I HAD AN EXPERIENCE HELPING FELIX BAUMGARTNER FROM JUMPING FROM SPACE FOR MY FOLLOW UP THE SIDE OF AN AIRPLANE. BASICALLY UNCONSCIOUS AND 26,00. AND I WOKE UP 10,000 FEET IN FREE FALL. AND THEY ARE STARTED TO GET THICKER AND THE OXYGEN COMES BACK IN YOUR BRAIN IS WORKING. IT WAS SCARY STUFF. SO I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUS. JOKING AND FUNNY BUT AS WE GET AND I MADE ON THE OUTSIDE SEEMED CLOSER, THIS STUFF GETS REAL SERIOUS NOW. >> WHEN DAVID IS GOING UP AND GETTING INTO THE THINNER AND THINNER ATMOSPHERE, WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TELL IF HE'S LOSING IT A LITTLE BIT? >> I FEEL THAT I CAN. DAVID DID A GREAT THING AND HE BROUGHT IN SOME FRIENDS THAT KNOW HIM AND HIS PERSONALITY. I WILL REFER TO THEM A LITTLE BIT IF THEY FEEL HE IS ACTING DIFFERENT THEN HE IS NORMALLY. I MIGHT TAKE THEIR ADVICE AND WEIGH THAT INTO MY DECISIONS WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO. >> GOTCHA. SO I'M HERE THINKING, DAVID BLAINE MIGHT BE THE GUY WHO CAN TRAIN FOR OXYGEN DEPRIVATION. IF YOU CAN TRAIN FOR THIS, HE CAN BREATH HOLD AND THAT KIND OF THING, WILL THAT WORK? >> IT DRIVES ME CRAZY BECAUSE HE HOLDS HIS BREATH SO LONG AND SO GOOD AT THE OXYGEN PART, BUT I'M LIKE COMMITTED SERIOUS. NO ONE CAN OVERCOME CERTAIN ALTITUDES. IT IS JUST WHAT HAPPENS. BUT WE RODE UP IN AN AIRPLANE TOGETHER AND WE PUT PULSE OX ON OUR FINGERS MEASURING THE OXYGEN CONTENT IN HER BLOOD AND WE CLIMB TO 25,000 FEET. HE WAS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN I WAS. AND I GOT 20,000 DRUMS AND SPENT HALF OF MY LIFE IN THE AIR. HE PROCESSES OXYGEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN ME. I DID IT TO PROVE TO HIM THAT IT DOESN'T WORK AND IT ACTUALLY WORKED A LITTLE BIT. SO NOW I'M GOING TO BE FIGHTING THAT TODAY. >> HE IS IN HIS OWN GOOD HANDS AND TRAINING FOR IT. SO I'M ALSO THINKING LIKE IF HE DOES GET TO THAT TIGHT AND BECOMES A PROBLEM, YOU HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL AS A LAST RESORT TO MAYBE BRING IT LOWER AND SORT OF FEEL LIKE HE'S GETTING BACK. >> WE CAN. I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IF IT IS ME AND I LANDED AND I'M OKAY, I'M UPSET. AND YOU WRECKED MY STUNK DUMB EXTENT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE NOT MY DAD. IT IS A FINE LINE WHAT IS SAFE ON WHAT DAVID IS ALL ABOUT, DOING AN AMAZING, INTENSE THINGS. >> GOTCHA. WE HAVE A LITTLE PIECE WITH HIM LEARNING HIS BREATH HOLDING TECHNIQUE AND ACTUALLY GETTING BETTER AT IT. SO IF IT WORKS, IT WORKS. LET'S CHECK THAT OUT. >> THERE IS ONE TECHNIQUE I STARTED WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD THAT I HAVE SPENT THE LAST FOUR DECADES LEARNING HOW TO DO BETTER AND BETTER. THE TECHNIQUE THAT I HAVE LEARNED FOR HOLDING MY BREATH WAS ESSENTIAL AND EVEN ALLOWED ME TO BREAK A WORLD RECORD JUST BY LEARNING TO CONTROL MY ONE OF THE POSSIBLE THREATS ON BREATHING AND SLOW MY HEART RATE. MY NEXT STUNT IS A POTENTIALLY FATAL CONDITION CALLED HYPOXIA. HYPOXIA IS WHEN YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH OXYGEN BECAUSE YOU GO TO HIGH AND YOU ARE NOT IN A PRESSURIZED CABIN LIKE AN AIRPLANE SO YOU ARE BREATHING THE AIR THAT HAS LESS OXYGEN. WHEN YOU BECOME HYPOXIC, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING SO YOU'RE COMPLETELY FOGGY, IT IS LIKE YOU ARE DRUNK. BUT THE BREATHING TECHNIQUE CAN HELP ME OVERWRITE HYPOXIA BY KEEPING BLOOD OXYGEN SATURATED AND HIDE. >> WE HAVE THE FIRST READING TAKE OFF AT 200 FEET. I WAS 98% O2 AND DAVID WAS 97. SO AS WE GO UP, WE WILL SEE WHAT WE GET. >> AS WE ASCENDED TO TO HIGHER ALTITUDES, LUKE'S OXYGEN LEVELS BEGAN TO DROP. BY USING THE SAME BREATHING TECHNIQUES THAT I HAVE LEARNED, I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY BLOOD OXYGEN LEVELS NORMAL MORE THAN . >> WE ARE AT 18. I'M STILL GOOD. IT'S NOT HYPOXIA. [LAUGHTER] >> ONCE WE REACH OUR PEAK ALTITUDE, MY OXYGEN LEVEL IS DROPPING AS WELL SO I NEEDED TO BREATHE O2 TO RECOVER. I WILL NEED TO PREVENT HYPOXIA. >> THERE IS NO FOOTAGE. THERE IS NOTHING OF SOMEONE GOING UP TO EXTREME ALTITUDES USING THIS TECHNIQUE AND BEING PERFECTLY FINE. >> LOOK AT THIS. HYPOXIA. >> 85 O2 LEVEL MINUS 98. >> WHEN I'M SHOOTING MY SPECIALS, PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IF WHAT I'M DOING IS REAL OR IS IT MAGIC. ONE OF THE THINGS I OFTEN DEMONSTRATE TO ANSWER THEM IS TEACHING THEM HOW TO HOLD THEIR BREATH LONGER THAN THEY REALIZE AS POSSIBLE. SOME OF THEM EVEN FIND IT RELEVANT TO WHAT THEY DO. >> WINTER IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND LEARNING HOW TO BREATHE PROPERLY, THIS IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY. >> HEY, YEAH! >> I KNOW IT WILL BENEFIT ME CERTAINLY WHEN YOU GET TO 2 MINUTES, I WILL BE HAPPY. >> BEFORE WE START, WE WILL DO A TEST. I WILL SAY TAKE A DEEP BREATH, EVERYBODY HOLD, HOLD YOUR HAND UP. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THEN H HOLD. >> THE AVERAGE HUMAN BREATH. 1:41, VERY IMPRESSIVE. GOOD. 1:45. >> MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THEY CAN HOLD THEIR BREATH FOR LONGER THAN A MINUTE. AND I'VE TAUGHT MANY PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS HOW TO HOLD THEIR BREATH FOR THREE TO 4 MINUTES. DON'T TRY THAT ON YOUR OWN, BUT NOW I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THE PROCESS TO YOU. YOU WILL TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND WE WILL HOLD FOR A SECOND AND THEN WE WILL EXHALE ABOUT TEN SECONDS. IT IS GOING TO FLUSH THE CO2 OUT OF THE BLOODSTREAM. YOU WILL GET NUMB FEELINGS AND YOUR LIPS. YOU MIGHT GET TINGLING IN YOUR FINGERS. IMAGINE YOU ARE BLOWING A TOY BOAT OVER THE SURFACE OF THE POOL BUT DON'T DO IT TO THE POINT THAT YOU ARE BLACKING OUT, BUT PUSH IT ENOUGH. AND THEN A HUGE BREATH IN AND HOLD. FEEL TINGLY, THEY ARE AS OVERFLOWING AND FEELS LIKE IT WILL COME OUT, JUST HOLD APPEAR TO HOLD IT, RELAX. RECOVER BREATH. YOU PURGE SO HARD THAT YOU BLACKED YOURSELF OUT. >> JUST KEEP RECOVERING. CRAZY, DUDE, HE IS FULLY BLACKED OUT. >> THE LAST ONE WHEN WE WERE DOING THE PURGING -- >> IT IS SO EASY TO BLACK OUT ON THAT. WE WILL JUST DO A FEW MINUTES OF THIS RECOVERY, AND THEN WE WILL GET IN THE POOL. IF WE GET TO 3:30, WE HAVE PASSED A LIFELONG RECORD. IF WE GET TO 4 MINUTES, WE ARE AT THE ELITE NAVY SEAL. THAT IS THE VERY TOP. HUGE BREATH IN. GO UNDER WHEN YOU ARE READY. JUST GET AS COMFORTABLE AS YOU CAN. >> CAN I SEE IF YOU ARE OKAY? SIGNAL IF YOU ARE OKAY. GOOD, 3 MINUTES IS GREAT. >> RECOVER. 4:25. >> RECOVER. [LAUGHTER] >> YOU DID 4:45. >> DAVID. >> 4:45 IS NO JOKE. THAT IS SERIOUS FOR YOUR FIRST TIME. >> SO THAT HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW I SERVED. BEFORE I DROP, AND THEN I GET THE DROP IN IN THE WAY IF I WILL EXHALE. >> HOW WAS YOUR LITTLE BLACK OUT IN THE CHAIR? I FELT LIKE SOMEBODY PUT A HAT ON MY HEAD. >> YOU GET LOST AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS. >> ONCE WE GET PAST, WELL. WE GOT PAST THE NAVY SEALs. [LAUGHTER] >> DO NOT DO THIS ON YOUR OWN WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING BECAUSE NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE TECHNIQUE COME IF YOU DO IT TO THE POINT THAT HE DID WHEN WE WERE PRACTICING, HE BLACKED OUT FROM PUSHING TOO HARD. IF YOU BLACKED OUT ON THE WATER, NO ONE IS WATCHING YOU IN SHALLOW WATER. THAT IS VERY EASY. >> DARK. [LAUGHTER] >> TOMORROW, YOU GUYS WILL HAVE A SLIGHT LITTLE BIT OF HEADACHE BUT IT GOES AWAY FAST. I COMPLETELY FORGOT TO SAY THIS. IT IS A CO2 BULLET, BUT IT GOES AWAY. I WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO DO IT. >> AWESOME, SO ACTUALLY GAVE THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOT. I WAS UNDER WATER OR ANYTHING BUT I WENT FOR ONE MINUTE TO AROUND 2 MINUTES, WHICH I WAS VERY PROUD OF. >> AND WHEN WE HAVE TIME, THE ONE THING I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE IS IT IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS TO SO NOBODY TRIED TO DO THAT. DO THAT. WHEN I DO IT, ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE AN INCREDIBLE TEAM AROUND ME AND I SUPERVISE AND LEARN ALL THE SKILLS SO THERE IS NO RISK IN THE SHALLOW WATER DEPTH. ON YOUR COUCH MIGHT ALSO DON'T RECOMMEND. >> I THINK THE TRAINING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE, BUT I THINK I JUST WANT TO ZOOM OUT FOR A SECOND. YOU ARE GOING TO GRAB A BUNCH OF BALLOONS, FLOAT UP INTO THE SUNRISE OVER THIS MAJESTIC LANDSCAPE UNTIL YOU ARE A TINY DOT, AND THEN YOU WILL LET GO OF AND SKYDIVE TO THE GROUND. THE BALLOONS WITH A PARACHUTE ON THAT IS WHY OLD. SO I JUST LIKE -- >> -- >> ICE HER STOMACH AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU GUYS BUT WE HAVE A PERFECT WINDOW SO WE NEED TO LUNCH AT 7:45. >> I DON'T WANT TO PUSH MOTHER NATURE BUT WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. >> EVERYTHING HAS SHIFTED. NO LATER THAN 7:45. >> OKAY. >> WE WILL HURRY THINGS ALONG. I CAN TELL THE WIND IS PERFECT SO THAT IS GREAT. >> IT IS NOW TIME AND I LOVE THE CAMERAS, AND LOVE YOU GUYS WATCHING. IT'S TIME TO GET GOING. 5 MINUTES AND THEN WE WILL START GEARING UP. I KNOW YOU HAVE A SHOW, BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING. >> THAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF IT AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRAINING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT EXTRA MATTERS. FACTOR THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, HYPOXIA. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. WE TALKED ABOUT THE PARIS SHOOTING AT THE LANDING AND THAT IS ALSO SUPER IMPORTANT BUT TEMPERATURE, WHEN YOU ARE FLOATING OFF INTO THE CLOUDS BUT NOT ONLY DOES IT GET THIN BUT WY COLDER. I'M TOLD THREE AND A HALF DEGREES CELSIUS OR 7 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT COLDER FOR EVERY THOUSAND FEET YOU GO UP HERE IT'S OVER IT'S GETTING REAL COLD UP THERE. NOW I'M FROM NEW YORK AND DAVID IS FROM NEW YORK. WE ARE USED TO COLD WEATHER HANDS BUT IF YOU GET YOUR PARACHUTE DOWN IN YOUR HANDS ARE TOO COLD, THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM. SO YOU HAVE TO GET READY FOR COLD WEATHER TOO. IT WILL BE COLD. LET'S CHECK OUT HOW WE TRAIN FOR THE COLD. >> HOPEFULLY YOU ARE NOT CLAUSTROPHOBIC. >> TRY TO STAY IN THERE AS LONG AS I POSSIBLY CAN. >> I CAN'T DO IT. >> OKAY. JUMP OUT MAYBE 30 SECONDS. 40 SECONDS. THE WAY THIS HELPS MY NEXT AUNT IS WHEN I'M GOING UP ON THE BALLOONS AND WRITING ALL THE WAY UP, BASICALLY YOU LOSE THREE AND A HALF DEGREES BUT ON THE FIRST JUMP THAT I DID FROM 25,000 FEET, I HAD A FULL FACE MASK ON. THE FIRST BREATH THAT I TOOK, THE WHOLE THING ICED OVER SO MY SKYDIVING WAS JUMPING DOWN AND I HAD TO LOOK THROUGH THIS LITTLE HOLE. >> ICE. >> ICE IMMEDIATELY. >> THAT IS CRAZY. >> AND YOU WILL TAKE MY TEMPERATURE BECAUSE ONCE WE GO INTO CRYOGENIC COME I WANT TO SEE IF THE TEMPERATURES DROP. HE WILL BE 98.3. >> WE HAD ONE PROFESSIONAL BOXER YESTERDAY TO HAVE FILE. >> HE GOT KNOCKED OUT IN ONE ROUND. >> WOW THIS IS CRAZY RIGHT NOW. >> ARE YOU DOING OKAY? >> YEP. >> YOU ARE HALFWAY THERE. >> HE'S GOT 45 SECONDS LEFT. HE IS DOING GREAT. HE IS STARTING TO SHAKE. >> ALL RIGHT, GOOD JOB. >> WOW! >> THAT IS AMAZING. YOU SAID THAT WAS ONE LEVEL. WHAT IS THE NEXT LEVEL OF THAT? >> JUST CRANK IT TO THE HIGHEST BECOME MORE INTENSE. FOR ME. >> IN THE STUNT, HAVE TO LEARN WHEN I'M GOING TO THESE HEIGHTS HOW TO STAY COMPLETELY COHERENT. AND HYPOXIA KICKS IN MUCH QUICKER WHEN YOU ARE IN EXTREME CONDITIONS. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING IN THERE, BRO? >> IT IS GOOD. >> HE SAYS HE'S GOOD. >> WE WILL DO TWO IN A ROW. NOW IT IS GOOD. >> THIS MAN. >> HE IS TRYING TO GO AGAIN FOR THREE. >> YOU WANT TO GO FOR A THIRD YEAH. TIME? >> I JUST WANTED TO TRIPLE CHECK. HE WILL BE IN THERE FOR 9 MINUTES. DUDE. >> THIS IS THE LONGEST I THINK ANYONE WOULD EVER THINK ABOUT DOING. >> YOU HAVE ABOUT 25 SECONDS LEFT, BRO. >> I DO NOT KNOW HOW. THAT WAS INSANE. >> WOW! [APPLAUSE] >> THAT IS GOOD. LET'S SEE IF THE TEMPERATURE >> LOOK. DROPPED. [LAUGHTER] YO, YOU DID IT, BRO, YOU ARE GOING TO BE GOOD TO GO. >> SO I GUESS ONE LAST IMPORTANT BIT IS, WELL WE WENT OVER THE IMAGE FLOATING UP ON THE BALLOONS. AND I LOVE THE ART OF IT. LIKE IT IS A SILHOUETTE OF A GUY GOING OVER THE HORIZON WITH BALLOONS, RIGHT? BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT, HE DOESN'T HAVE A PARACHUTE ON. SO THIS IS AN IDEA YOU GUYS WENT BACK AND FORTH ABOUT, HOW, WHEN DOES HE GET IT ON? >> I ALMOST WISH I WOULDN'T HAVE WE PUT A MAN ON THE MOON AND WE IS THERE A WAY? BROUGHT IT UP. CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS. BUT THEN I WAS REGRETTING IT FOR QUITE A WHILE. WE HAVE BEEN PRACTICING PUTTING THE PARACHUTE ON. BUT FOR ME COMMIT IS THE MOST CRITICAL PORTION. HE COULD LAND AND CRASH LAND WITH HIS PARACHUTE OUT IN AN AREA AND HURT HIS ANKLE AND BREAK HIS LEG. BUT IF HE DOESN'T GET THE PARACHUTE ON AND COME OUT OF SOMETHING IN A HURRY, LIKE A MOTHER'S NO OPTIONS. THAT IS REAL. IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT ON MY MIND, THAT IS EQUIVALENT OF NOT MAKING IT. >> SO IS PULLING THE PARACHUTE DOWN AND HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE? >> THE FASTEST WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT IS AROUND TWO AND HALF MINUTES. SO ABOUT 500 FEET A MINUTE AND WE WILL START THAT AT ROUGHLY FOUR OR 5,000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT TAKES THAT LONG AND IS GETTING COLDER, LESS OXYGEN APPEAR ITS OWN GOING TO BE OCCURRING AND PUSHING HIM TO DO WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT. HE'S THE ONLY ONE UP THERE. ONCE HIS FEET LEAVES THE GROUND, IT IS ON HIM. >> THAT SAY THAT WAS GREAT. THEN YOU GUYS GOT TO LAND. YOU GUYS WENT UP AND LOOKED AT SOME SITES. THERE IS A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM OUT HERE. I SEE MACES MY DESERTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. HOW DID THAT GO? THE OTHER DAY, I CAME OUT INTO IT AND EXPECTION, GOING TO THE DESERT. WE WILL BE IN THE DESERT AND IT WILL BE GREAT AND THEN I GOT HERE AND I STARTED FLYING AROUND AND CHECKING IT OUT AND DAVID GOT HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER AND I SAID DAVID, DO NOT GET IN A HELICOPTER. DO NOT LOOK UNTIL WE HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT A MAP AND TALK ABOUT IT. BLUE, IT IS NO PROBLEM. MAN, DON'T GET IN THE HELICOPTER. >> WE WENT FOR A RIDE CAME DOWN AND IT GOT VERY REAL FOR HIM. AS REAL AS IT HAS BEEN FOR ME THE WHOLE TIME THAT I HAVE ALL THESE GNARLY SPOTS. WHERE MY GOING TO LAND, LUKE? I CAN LAND IN BEAUTIFUL NICE GRASS BUT THIS IS MOUNTING FROM THE CLIFFS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FENCE A LITTLE BIT. EVERYTHING CAME AROUND AND NOW HE'S NERVOUSLY EXCITED, I THINK, TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. >> IF ANYBODY IS GOOD TO TRAIN HIM COMMIT ISSUE. HOW MANY LUNCHES? I HAVE 20,000 SKY DIVES. >> IT TAKES A LOT OF TRAINING AND ESPECIALLY BUT SKYDIVING A THAT IS WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN LOT OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SO DOING AND A LITTLE PIECE ABOUT HOW HE'S GOT IT. >> ON THE DAY OF ASCENSION COME IF I HAVE TO RELEASE FROM THE BALLOONS COME I WILL NEED TO SKYDIVE THERE SKYDIVE DOWN TO SAVE MY LIFE. WHEN WE GET AS CLOSE TO 500 CHUMS, I FEEL SAFE ALMOST OVER ANY AREA. >> ALL RIGHT, NICELY DONE. GOOD JOB. I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS I NEVER HAD. IT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE SKILL TO LEARN. ♪ ♪ >> MY FIRST 100 JUMPS WERE DONE WITH SCOTT SMITH, WHO IS A WORLD CHAMPION FREESTYLE SKYDIVER AND A GREAT INSTRUCTOR. A REPETITIOUS LEAD JUMPED SOMETIMES 15 TIMES A DAY SO I CAN HAVE COMPLETE AWARENESS OF EVERYTHING AROUND ME. AND THEN HOW TO LAND SAFELY IN A SPECIFIC AREA. WHICH ACTUALLY TURNS OUT TO BE THE HARDEST PART. >> I LANDED SO FAR FROM EVERYTHING. LIKE I'M IN THE MIDDLE -- I LANDED AROUND A BUNCH OF TREES WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LAND IS WHERE THAT LITTLE THOUGHT IS RIGHT THERE. >> THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF BAD LANDINGS THAT I'VE HAD TO. >> YEAH, OH, SHUT IT DOWN, ALL THE WAY! STOP, STOP! >> ANOTHER TIME I CRASHED INTO A FENCE IN MY BODY FLIPPED OVER. THESE ARE MY LITTLE WHOAS. >> THAT'S GOT MY INITIALS ON IT RIGHT THERE. IT WAS OKAY BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. LIKE THIS MUCH, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOW IS DONE. >> OBVIOUSLY, THE DANGER IN SKYDIVING IS THE EARTH COMING AT US AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IF YOU DO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW IT WILL KILL YOU FOR SURE AND YOU HAVE LOST FRIENDS AND IS TOUGH. THE LAST FOR YEARS I'VE LOST A HUNDRED FRIENDS. >> I WISH I HAD A HUNDRED FRIENDS. SKYDIVER SENSE OF HUMOR IS LIKE THAT, SORRY. >> 20 YEARS I WAS HERE TRAINING FOR MY STUNT WHERE I STOOD ON A PILLAR FOR 36 HOURS AND HAD TO JUMP OFF OF A CARDBOARD BOX. MY COACH PAT WHO IS IN THIS PICTURE RIGHT HERE IN 2011, SOMEBODY COLLIDED INTO HIM AND HE PASSED AWAY. >> PECK FROM HIS EXAMPLE IS WHEN HE DID NOTHING. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT STICK WITH ME PAIR THE ONES I COULDN'T SAY I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS. IT CAN HAPPEN TO THEM AND IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY. >> DURING THE STUNT COME I WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE WINDS WILL TAKE ME. SO I NEED TO LEARN HOW TO GET TO A SPOT WHERE I CAN LAND SAFELY WITH MY PARACHUTE. >> MONEY. >> THAT IS WHY I REACHED OUT TO LUKE AIKINS, THE MAN WHO JUMPED FROM 25,000 FEET OUT OF AN AIRPLANE WITH NO PARACHUTE AND LANDED IN A SMALL NET. THERE IS NO WHEN I WOULD TRUST MORE THAN LUKE TO TEACH ME HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE SKY AND LAND SAFELY. CLEAR BUILDINGS, POWER LINES AND ANY OTHER DANGEROUS OBSTACLES. >> YEAH, BUDDY. MY GOAL IS TO GET HIM ANYWHERE HE DROPS, HE CAN LAND. SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO TRACK YOUR BODY THROUGH THE AIR. >> TRACKING IS A WAY TO TRY TO GET TO A SPECIFIC LOCATION MUCH FASTER. BASICALLY, YOU ARE FLYING. LUKE HAS BEEN TEACHING ME HOW TO TRACK. WHEN YOU TRACK, YOU CAN APPLY REALLY FAST, AND IT FEELS SO GOOD. IT IS LIKE YOU ARE CUTTING THROUGH THE AIR, AND IT IS SO AMAZING. THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING PROJECT THAT I HAVE EVER WORKED ON. LEARNING TO SKYDIVE FROM SOME OF THE BEST COACHES IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN UNLIKE ANYTHING I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED. >> YEAH, IT LOOKS GREAT! >> I LOVE SKYDIVING AND BEING ABLE TO DO THIS OVER AND OVER AND ACTUALLY LEARN IT IS AMAZING. I HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHALLENGES I WILL FACE POOR "ASCENSION" AND WITH ALL THE PREPARATION WE HAVE DONE, I FEEY THIS ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE FEELING OF FLYING BALLOON IS LIKE FLOATING. AND THE FEELING OF JUMPING OUT OF A PLANE IS LIKE FLYING. SO BETWEEN FLOATING AND FLYING, THESE ARE THE TWO THINGS I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF AS A KID. PUTTING THIS TOGETHER, IT SURPASSES ANY OF MY DREAMS. >> ALL RIGHT STATUS UPDATE TIME, HOW ARE YOU DOING JIM? I WAS A CLUSTER DOING? ALL THE BLINDS ARE ATTACHED NOW, THE CAMERAS ARE INSTALLED, FOCUSED, TESTED AND WE WEIGHED OFF THE CLUSTER AND THE UPLIFT WE ARE IN THE FINAL STAGES FOR THAT WE ARE EXPECTING. SURE. >> BASICALLY ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET DAVID, I MEAN, HE'S PUTTING HIS HARDEST ON NOW ONCE HE'S ATTACHED TO IT, READY TO LIFT OFF BASICALLY? A FINAL ADJUSTMENT WITH BERT TO MAKE SURE WE GO OUT AT THE SPEED WE WANT TO INITIALLY. AND THEN THAT AS IT APPEARED THAT HE WINS. >> NICE. I HAVE A BUNCH OF YOUTUBE QUESTIONS, THERE IS A CHAT AND SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. FIRST OF ALL HOW MANY BALLOONS AND I'M LOOKING 30 FEET TALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? CLOSER TO 50 FEET TALL AND THERE IS 52 BALLOONS. >> 52 CARDS. >> THAT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. >> I LIKE THAT. THE BALLOONS HAVE HELIUM IN THEM. HOW MUCH IF YOU JUST LET THOSE GO, HOW MUCH LIFT -- I GUESS IT IS A MATH QUESTION -- HOW MANY IS 50 HELIUM BALLOONS RIGHT NOW? AN 8-FOOT BALLOON IS 50 POUNDS. MOST OF THIS IS 8-FOOT DIAMETER BALLOON MAY HAVE FIVE AND A HALF AND 4-FOOT DIAMETER BALLOONS. THE LIFT THE MORE WE CAN DIAL IT THE SMALLER THE BALLOON TO LIST IN. >> ARE YOU ONLY POPPING SMALL ONES ARE BIG ONES? BIG ONES ACTUALLY. THOSE ARE FOR A BIG ADJUSTMENT ACTUALLY. >> GOTCHA. WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO DAVID IN THE AIR? >> I WILL NOT WHICH I THINK DAVID WILL BE THRILLED ABOUT BUT LUKE WILL HAVE A DIRECT LINE. THAT IS AWESOME. >> WHERE TO CISCO WHEN IT IS DONE? SO WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED CONTROL AND A PLANE FROM A ANTIDOTE ANY TIME A MONTH CAMERA, I JUST BRING THE NOISE WITH ME. BUT ONCE THIS THING IS JUMPED FROM IT GETS BROUGHT DOWN INTO DESERT? >> AT THE PLATE TEAM WILL BE WATCHING THE FLIGHT PATTERN. AND THE SAME AS DAVID MEANS TO FIND A LANDING SPOT. THEY WILL FIND A SAFE LANDING SPOT FOR THIS TO START PRINTING BALLOONS SO IT STARTS COMING DOWN. AS IT GETS TO THE GROUND, THEY WILL DUMP REMOTE TO SLOW THE DESCENT RATE TO HAVE A RECOVERY TEAM PICK IT UP. >> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY LINT YOU NEED TO POP TO RECOVER IT? IT DEPENDS ON THE FLIGHT AND TO KEEP DAVID SPEED CORRECT IN ALL THAT STUFF. THOSE GUYS ARE EXCELLENT AT THINKING ON THE SPOT WITH SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION. >> GOTCHA. SOMETIMES THOSE BALLOONS DISPLAY OUT A LITTLE BIT. I WAS LOOKING AT MY 8-MILE-AN-HOUR WIND DAY AND I WANTED TO FEEL IT BUT I DIDN'T. THEY KIND OF SPREAD OUT A LOT. THAT SEEMED LIKE EITHER REALLY GOOD OR REALLY BAD FOR CATCHING A LOT OF WIND. WHAT DO THESE LOOK LIKE FLOATING IN THE AIR? >> WHEN THEY ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR ACTUALLY THE CLUSTER BEHAVES AS ONE BIG OBJECT. THEY ARE NOT TETHERED TO THE GROUND. SO WHEN THE WIND HITS THEM, THEY MOVE WITH THE WIND AS OPPOSED TO YOUR CLUSTER WHEN WE TRY TO PUT YOU UP THE OTHER DAY WAS TETHERED TO THE GROUND AND THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH BALLOONS SO THE WIND COMES THROUGH. EVERYTHING GOES WILD. >> HERE AS MAY BE A LITTLE WEIRD QUESTION. WHAT IF A BALLOON POPS UNINTENTIONALLY? LIKE IN SOME TESTING IT IS HAPPEN WHERE ONE OF THE BALLOONS HAS POPPED. WHAT IS GOING ON THEN? THAT IS WHY WE HAVE DAVID WITH A COUPLE OF BAGS ON HIM HE CAN WORK WITH AND THEN WE HAVE REMOTE DEPLOYABLE BALLAST INSIDE THE PAYLOAD. SO IF THE BALLOON POPS AND THAT AFFECTS THE LIFT, SPEED, THE FLIGHT TEAM CAN DROP A LITTLE BIT OF SAND TO GET US TO BE POSITIVE AGAIN. >> HOW MUCH HELIUM WOULD YOU SAY IS IN ALL 52 BALLOONS? THEY HAVE 18-WHEELER FULL OF THE LIMB OVER THERE. WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF SENDING THEM HOME EMPTY. >> SO THAT IS HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF THE LYMPH? >> IT IS MEASURED IN CUBIC FEET AND IT'S A HOLE. >> THERE'S A LOT OF CURIOUS QUESTIONS FROM THE YOUTUBE AUDIENCE BUT MORE, GENERALLY ABOUT WILL ALL COME TOGETHER? THERE ARE SO MUCH TECH. SO MUCH PREPARATION THAT HAS GONE INTO IT AND SO MUCH TEAMWORK. THE WEATHER. I WILL SAY I DON'T WANT TO JINX IT BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY AMAZING. I DON'T FEEL ANY WIND. HAPPY. THIS IS A MAJESTIC SITE SO I'M >> IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING ON THIS PROJECT. IT IS NOT A QUESTION IF IF IT WILL HAPPEN BUT WHAT WE WILL GO THROUGH TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND BECAUSE WE DID IT TOGETHER, HERE WE ARE READY TO GO. >> OKAY, YOU WANT TO WALK UP HERE AND CHECK IT OUT? >> ABSOLUTELY, WE CAN. >> SO THESE ARE THE CAMERAS RIGHT HERE THAT WILL BE FACING DAVID AS HE IS IN THE AIR? >> CORRECT. THEY WERE PRETTY BLIND SO WE CAN SEE PRETTY MUCH HIS WHOLE SELF WHILE HE IS HANGING THERE. SO IT WILL GIVE US A REAL IDEA WHAT HE IS LOOKING AROUND THERE. >> HIS PERSPECTIVE, PROBABLY A LOT OF BLUE SKIES. >> HOPEFULLY SOME OF THIS BEAUTIFUL BACKGROUND BELOW HIM, AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING. >> AND OVER HERE, WE HAVE DAVID'S OXYGEN LATER IN THE PLATE TO AVOID HYPOXIA. AND THIS IS HOW THE LOWER PART OF THE CLUSTER HAS COME TOGETHER. >> I DON'T THINK I'VE ASKED YOU WHAT THE BALLOONS ARE MADE UP. >> LATE TEXT. IS THAT BIODEGRADABLE WHEN IT LANDS IN YOUR POP A BALLOON? JUST LIKE WEATHER BALLOONS, DESIGNED TO NOT AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT. >> AWESOME. HOW MANY OF THEM DO YOU LIKE SEE ANOTHER WEATHER LIKE APPARATUS? >> WHETHER BALLOONS ARE USUALLY JUST ONE REALLY LONG BALLOON. BECAUSE THE AESTHETIC IS NOT AS IMPORTANT. IT IS VERY UTILITARIAN. >> CLUSTERS POPULAR BALLOONING MECHANISM, I GUESS. >> FOR SURE, THERE'S A LOT OF POINTS OF FAILURE. EVERY BALLOON IS A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE. >> DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE COLOR BLEND? I HAVE A FAVORITE COLOR. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR? THIS BLUE ONE HERE. >> IT IS A GOOD RIGGER BLUE. THERE IS A LOT OF RED AND THE YELLOW ONCE MATCH THE PAYLOAD. WE LIKE THOSE TOO. >> SO THE PLAN IS TO TAKE OFF? THAT ONE GOES UP AND IT'S AN RF PLATFORM SENDING RADIO SIGNALS. IT CIRCLES AROUND DAVID AT ABOUT 5 MILES AND SINCE ALL OF THESE SIGNALS BACK DOWN TO US. THAT IS WHAT IS ABOUT TO PLAY OUT. I WANT TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS THE BALLOONS AS HE TAKES OFF. >> YEAH, LET'S HOP DOWN FOR A SECOND. I THINK THAT IS WHILE THIS ENTIRE PROJECT. THERE WAS SO MUCH TECH THAT I HAVE SEEN THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED LIKE YOU MENTIONED THE PLANE GOING UP. IT'S GOT ALL SORTS OF ANTENNAS BEAMING INFORMATION DOWN MAKING SURE CONNECTIONS ARE SECURE. MAKING SURE THIS CONNECTION IS SECURE. THEN ART MENTIONS OF MILITARY CHANNELS THAT ARE USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE SQUIBS THAT ARE ENCODED SO NOBODY WHO GETS THE RADIO SIGNALS CAN EVER POP ON JUST BY GETTING IN. THERE WAS SO MUCH THAT GOES INTO THIS SO I'M GLAD. >> IT'S ALL ABOUT REDUNDANCY. IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE NO ONE THING CAN TAKE US DOWN AND PUT DAVID IN DANGER. >> BEAUTIFUL. I WILL GO BACK TO THE HANGAR TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. >> THANK YOU. >> HAVE FUN. >> THANK YOU. >> ON HIS BELLY, CABLE, WE HAVE TO DO ALL OF THAT FIRST. >> GOOD MORNING, DAVID. >> GOOD MORNING, MAN. >> HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE HERE? HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE UNTIL LAUNCH? IS THAT THE ANTENNA? >> YOU HAVE LIKE 10 MINUTES OR SO. >> HOW MANY UNTIL LAUNCH? >> 30 MINUTES, 35 MINUTES. WE HAVE 40 MINUTES. I WAS ROBBING YOU. IT LOOKS GOOD, THE WINDS ARE PERFECT. DON IS JUST LAUNCHING AN EYEBALL OUT THERE. TO SEE WHERE THE TRUCK GOES, THE LANDING AREA LOOKS THE SAME. EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD, ALL OF THAT. RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE PUTTING ON BATTERIES. A LUG RADIO. ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING FOR -- >> NO, WE'VE GOT THIS. >> EVERYTHING IS LOOKING REALLY GOOD OUT THERE. THIS IS THE CRAZY PART. WE KNOW THIS WILL BE BUSY WITH EVERYBODY WATCHING AND CHECKING IT OUT. THE CAMERAS. >> I THOUGHT WE DECIDED WE WOULD HOOK IN YESTERDAY. ABLE TO GET DOWN. >> PERFECT, SHOOT, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ATTACK THE BEST LOW BECAUSE HE HAS TO CABLE FOLDED DOWN LOW. >> GET THE UPPER TOOTHPICKS. >> GET THE UPPER TOOTH PICKS AND LEAVE THE BOTTOM THERE. WHEN YOU ARE JUMPING, THE COOL SWEAT SHIRT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR POCKETS ARE ZIPPED UP. SO THAT THE POCKETS ARE ZIPPED UP BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT HANDLES GOING IN. THAT IS ON US. BUT WHEN YOU ARE IN FREE FALL, THE WORST THING WOULD BE THE SWEATSHIRT COMES UNDONE, RIGHT? IF YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR HANDLES, MAKE SURE ALL OF THAT. SO LEFT LEG IS A RADIO. THAT LETS ME COMMUNICATE TO DAVID WHEN IN THE AIR. THE BATTERY PACK POWERS THE WHOLE VEST AND NOT ONLY DOES THE IMAGE BUT ALSO TRANSMITS THE IMAGE. HE WEARS THIS BEST AND IT GETS WARM ON YOUR BACK. I WORTH THE OTHER DAY AND DAVID SAID IT GOT WARM. HE WAS UNDERPLAYING IT. IT WAS HOT. LIKE IT WAS SUPER HOT. >> WE WON'T HAVE THAT ISSUE. >> IT WILL BE A WARMER. HE DOES NOT NEED A HEAT FAST. YOU HAVE ALL THAT TECH ON YOUR BACK AND I WANT TO BRING IT UP BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HE MENTIONED IT YET, HE HAS TWO MAIN ANTENNAS AND ONE IS IN HIS BOOT. ONE WILL BE ON HIS CHEST. AND THEY WILL SWITCH BASED ON BAROMETER APPEARED AS HE HAS RIDING THE BALLOONS UP, THE CLOSEST ANTENNA COMMUNICATING WH THE GROUND IS IN HIS SHOE. AND AS HE SKYDIVE'S THE CLOSEST ANTENNA WILL BE IN HIS CHEST AND IT WILL SWITCH. >> REALLY COME I KNEW THERE WERE TWO ANTENNAS BUT I THOUGHT THEY WORKED THE SAME TIME. >> WHICH ONE IS CLOSER TO THE GROUND. >> WHAT HAPPENS IF HE TOTALS? THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THE ENGINEERS AND MAYBE IT WILL KEEP SWITCHING. >> LET'S HOPE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. BUT IT'S GETTING REAL NOW. WHENEVER YOU GUYS ARE READY FOR IT. LET'S SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE IT TAKES A VILLAGE HERE. >> THAT IS THE TEAMWORK. >> AND THEN DAVID HAS SPECIFIC WANTS AND IMAGES THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO COME UP AT THEM WE HAVE STUFF REQUIRED FOR SAFETY, RIGHT? HE ASKED ME AT ONE POINT, DO YOU THINK I CAN HANG 25,000 FEET JUST HOLDING ON? >> PROBABLY NOT. BUT THAT IS THE DAVID BLAINE HER AS MUCH AS YOU CAN MAKE IT THAT BETTER. MAGICAL, LIKE SURREAL LOOK, THE AND I THINK IT'S ALREADY INCREDIBLE THAT LIKE THIS IS A 50-FOOT CLUSTER OF BALLOONS AND WHAT KID HASN'T THOUGHT ABOUT LATCHING ONTO THEM AND FLOATING AWAY? SPEAK WITH THE VERY FIRST TIME I WENT TO PENNSYLVANIA. WE WALKED OUT THERE AND THEY HAVE THE BALLOONS GOING. IT WAS ALL A PERFECT MORNING. WE LOOKED INTO IT AND HIS FEET GOT OFF OF THE GROUND 2 INCHES. HE GIGGLED LIKE A LITTLE KID. IT WAS SUCH A FUNNY -- DO YOU REMEMBER THAT, DAVID? SO COOL, HE GIGGLED AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND LUKE. HE SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE SO JEALOUS ON THIS. >> THAT IS WHEN I HAD A TETHER ON. >> THAT PART LOOKS REALLY FUN COMING CAGING. WHEN YOU ARE LOW, IT IS GREAT. BUT AS HE STARTS TO LOOK THROUGH HIS FEET AND GAIN ALTITUDE, AND BECOMES A LOT MORE REAL. BUT WITH ALL THIS STUFF, THE LEGS AND THE WHOLE HARNESS. I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY YOU'RE USED TO BEING UNCOMFORTABLE ALL OF YOUR STUNTS. HE SAID THOSE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE BY CHOICE, NOT EQUIPMENT. SO HE DEFINITELY IS TRYING TO BE AS COMFORTABLE AS HE CAN, BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO HANG AROUND FOR AN HOUR AND BE LIKE STANDING HERE ON THE GROUND. >> I WILL REESTABLISH EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. I KNOW HOW YOU TO WORK IF TURNING IN AT THE CLIMAX, RIGHT? DAVID WILL GO UP AND YOU ALL HAVE SEEN THE HUGE CLUSTER OF BALLOONS BY NOW. THE PLAN IS TO HAVE HIM UNHOOK FROM THE GROUND, CONNECTED TO A TON OF HELIUM-FILLED BALLOONS. HE WILL GO FLOATING UP INTO THE SKY OVER THIS BEAUTIFUL DESERT LANDSCAPE OF PAGE, ARIZONA, INTO HE WILL KEEP GOING UP AND UP AND THE SUNRISE. UP UNTIL HE'S LIKE A LITTLE DOT IN THE SKY. IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN SKYDIVERS FROM THE GROUND, IT IS JUST A DOT. CLASSIC MARK HAS MOMENT JUST A LOT OF NOISE HAPPENING. THAT IS THE LAST PART, HE GETS UP AND HE BRINGS A PARACHUTE DOWN ONTO HIM, PUTS IT ON, JUMPS FROM THE BALLOONS, SKYDIVE'S TO THE GROUND, LANDS, AND HOPEFULLY ALL GOES WELL. THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF SAFETY AND TECH RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN APPEAR THE WEATHER TEAM WE TALKED TO, THE WINDS ARE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD, I THINK. WE HAVE ALL THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE PAYLOAD INSIDE THE BALLOON SO HE WILL BE TALKING TO HIS RADIOS, THE CAMERA SIGNAL SO WHEN HE GOES UP THERE WE CAN STILL SEE HIM AND HIS VIEW. THERE WAS A TON OF TECH HAPPENING. HE'S WEARING BATTERIES TO POWER ALL OF THIS STUFF AND A VEST. I , SO GOOD AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW. >> SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ELZIE'S. THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR THE LANDING. THE PROJECT JURIES WILL BE IN THIS GREEN AREA HERE. REMEMBER HIGH TENSION POWER LINES. THOSE WILL KILL YOU. YOU CANNOT LAND THOSE. >> WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? SO WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT HERE IS THIS IS THE AIRPORT. THE GREEN IS YOUR FLIGHT PATH. IT WILL CARRY YOU ALONG. WHERE IT TURNS WHITE, THAT IS WHERE WE SHOULD REACH 25,000 FEET. BEST GUESS I'M AMAZING, SO MANY VARIABLES. >> SO WHERE IS -- >> SO IT IS RIGHT HERE, STRAIGHT REFERENCE. BACK TO THE AIRPORT FOR A >> WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? >> YOU WILL SEE THE CITY OUT THERE. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING DOWN -- >> HOLD ON HIM AWAY, THE CITY IS HERE. SO THE CITY IS HERE, WHERE IS THE -- >> HOLD ON. >> THIS IS THE THREE TOWERS. SO IF I SEE THIS, THAT IS WHERE WE ARE BASICALLY. >> THAT IS WHERE WE ARE TAKING OFF. >> IF I SEE THIS ON MY RIGHT, CORRECT? I WILL NOT SEE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE, RIGHT? >> NOTHING EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE. >> I'M LOOKING FOR THIS ON MY LEFT AND THIS ON MY RIGHT, CORRECT? THEN WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR ONCE I COME DOWN. >> THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROAD, ONE ROAD THAT RUNS UNDERNEATH. AND THESE IRRIGATION POEMS THEY >> NO POWER LINES? STAND OUT TERRIFIC. THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FOR A REFERENCE. THAT IS EASY TO FIND, EASY TO SEE. THEN YOU WILL GO TOWARDS THE AIRPORT. STILL ON YOUR PATH TOWARDS THE AIRPORT. >> WAIT, I'M GOING TOWARDS THE AIRPORT IN THIS DIRECTION? OR TOWARDS THE AIRPORT? >> IT IS THE SAME THING. IT IS THE SAME THING. IT IS NORTH. YOU ARE HEADED NORTH. >> DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE AIRPORT. >> YOU WILL LOOK OUT HERE. OKAY. THIS STANDS OUT REALLY GOOD. THESE WATER PALMS. SO YOU ARE HEADING TOWARDS THE WATER PALMS, AND THE AIRPORT. WATER PALMS, AIRPORT. >> WHERE IS THE LANDING ZONE? RIGHT HERE. >> WHERE? RIGHT THERE? BUT ISN'T HERE OR HERE? >> NO, IT IS GREEN. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. >> SO CAN I SEE IT WITHOUT THE GRAIN WHERE IS THAT POSSIBLE? >> SURE. >> SO HERE IS ROUGHLY A SPOT THAT I HAVE LOOKED AT. I HAVE LIVED HERE. >> THAT IS CRAZY. >> IT IS VERY OBVIOUS, THE EDGE. THE SIMPLE WATER, BY THE WAY. >> THIS IS REAL. >> IT GETS REAL FOR SURE. >> REMEMBER THIS CHANGES EVERYDAY. WE LOOKED AT ALL OF THESE AREAS BUT REMEMBER IT COULDN'T BE THE ONLY OBSTACLE ON THAT WHOLE BETTER. FLAT. YOU JUMP OFF OF THE BALLOONS. YOU HEAD TOWARDS THE AIRPORT. ONCE YOU ARE AT THE AIRPORT HEADING THAT DIRECTION, YOU LOOK AT THOSE TWO LITTLE WATER PONDS. AND IT'S REALLY CLOSE COME IN FRONT OF THEM, EXACTLY, IN FRONT OF THEM IN THE LANDING ZONE, THIS IS ONE THAT WE PICKED. >> AND THE WORST PERSON WITH DIRECTIONS. >> THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU A BETTER REFERENCE. SO THEY SHOULD BE VERY, VERY EASY TO SEE. THIS IS WHAT I'M HOPING. AND IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS YOUR BEST LANDING SPOT. BESIDES THAT, YOU WILL PICK IN THE LITTLE RAVINE, THE SAND DRIPPINGS WE LOOKED OUT THERE. IF YOU END UP IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, YOU WILL PICK A NICE, SANDY REMAINED AND TRY NOT TO LAND ON A PAVED ROAD BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE POWER LINES WILL BE, RIGHT? OUR EYES ARE OPEN BUT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU. IT WILL BE SKETCHED. SO YOU WILL EXIT. WE WILL LOOK AT IT ONE MORE TIME AND I WILL LET YOU FINISH GET READING. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CURRENT BRIEFING WHERE WE ARE AT. >> WE WILL LOOK AT THAT AGAIN FOR SURE. >> LUKE COME ARE YOU ALSO GOING TO -- LUKE, YOU ARE ALSO GOING TO COMPLETE EYEBALL MULTIPLE TIMES? >> RIGHT NOW IS A GOOD TIME. WOW! >> THANK YOU. SO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT WILL COME UNDER THEY ARE THE TEMPLE BE UNDERNEATH IT. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE BIGGER T TAB. JUST FIELD THOSE AND GET AN IDEA WHERE THEY ARE AT AND WHAT THEY FEEL LIKE IN YOUR HAND. >> THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS GREAT. THAT IS AWESOME. WHEN DID YOU THINK OF THAT? THIS MORNING? [LAUGHTER] >> SO PERFECT. SO FIND THESE AND THAT MEANS I GET TO HEAR. >> LIVE BY THIS. LIVE BY THIS. >> GO UNDERNEATH AND YOU CAN GRAB THE SMALL ONES, PERFECT. NEXT. >> SIT DOWN, DAVID. I'M GOING TO DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. THAT IS GOOD. THAT IS GOOD. THAT IS GOOD. ALL RIGHT, HAVE A SEAT. >> ALL RIGHT. >> LAWRENCE, YOU HAVE 10 M 10 MINUTES? >> RIGHT FOOT. WE ARE GOING TO DO THESE LOSE FOR NOW. >> WHAT TIME IS IT? OKAY. GIVE ME A COUNT DOWN. SO GIVE ME LIKE 30 MINUTES UNTIL LAUNCH. >> ALL RIGHT. NOW I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP THESE -- SO SCOTT, YOU ARE GOING TO FIND ME. >> I WILL. >> OKAY. >> WHAT COLOR, RED? WHAT COLOR? >> YOU WILL SEE SOME WHITE. >> OKAY, GREAT. SO WHITE, ORANGE, RED. >> EVERYBODY CAN FEEL IT. AS SOON AS HE CAME OVER HERE TO GET READY, INTENSITY PICKED UP. I EXPECTED THAT. DAVID STARTS QUESTIONING LANDING, WHERE WE ARE LOOKING. THE DIRECTIONS. THERE IS A LOT GOING ON HERE. AND THEN THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING HIM AT THE SAME TIME SO YOU HAVE THAT. I HAVE NOTICED THAT LAST TIME HE WAS ABLE TO IGNORE THE CAMERAS AND WE GOT INTO THE MEAT OF WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO BE OKAY. SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE LANDING AREAS. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN APPEAR THEY ARE GEARING HIM UP. SAFETY CHECK IN STAN, SCOTT SMITH AND EVERYBODY HAS THEIR MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS. WHOLE TEAM IS DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND END UP CHECK IT. BUT IT IS GETTING REAL RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE -- >> HE WANTS TO WEAR IT. WE ARE UP HERE PAGE, ARIZONA, 4,200 FEET ABOVE THE OCEAN, SEA LEVEL. AIR AVIATION CARES ABOUT SEA LEVEL. EVERYTHING HERE TALKS ABOUT SEA LEVEL. SKYDIVERS ONLY CARE ABOUT GROUND LEVEL. SO WE CALL THAT A JAIL ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. I ONLY WANT HIM TO KNOW HIS ALTITUDE ABOVE THE GROUND. >> MAKE SENSE. HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BOTH BECAUSE HE WANTS TO KNOW. SO HE'S WORRIED ABOUT THE HYPOXIA PART BUT LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT. I AM WORRIED THAT HE WOULD SEE THE ALTITUDE AND HEAR THE TRAIN IS ALL DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO GROUND. WHERE EVERYTHING IS LEVEL. SO THE GROUND LEVEL IS INACCURATE NO MATTER WHAT. >> YEAH, IT IS DEFINITELY, THERE'S A LOT OF BACK-AND-FORTH, YOU KNOW? HE HAS OPINIONS. I HAVE OPINIONS. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US, BUT I THINK WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PAGE. SO HE HAS MSL AND AGL. >> LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE AND USAGE MESAS IS WHAT THEY CALLED THE LANDSCAPE FEATURES. >> I ACTUALLY PREFER IF HE ENDS UP IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION TO LAND ON THE TOP OF ONE OF THOSE. THOSE LITTLE HOUSES, FANS, POWER LINES, THERE'S NOTHING UP THERE. WE WILL FIGURE HOW TO GET HIM DOWN LATER. I WOULD CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE IF I END UP IN A BAD SPOT. >> GOTCHA. WE DIDN'T MENTION THE HELICOPTER IN ADDITION TO THE PLANE THAT IS GOING AROUND HIGH ALTITUDES. WE HAVE A CAMERA ON THE HELICOPTER SAID HER STOMACH SORT OF MIDDLE ALTITUDE BUT A LOT OF COMMUNICATION ON THE WAY UP. HE PASSES THE HELICOPTER MAX ALTITUDE AND STARTS TALKING WITH A PLANE AND COMES BACK DOWN. >> CORRECT. THE HELICOPTER WILL GET AMAZING SHOTS AND SERVES TO PURCHASES. CAPTURES DOMAIN CAPTURES THE BEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND EYES ON HIM THE WHOLE TIME. SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE. AT THE HELICOPTER PILOT A LONG TIME FRIEND OF MINE, FITZGERALD, ONE OF THE GUYS I TRUST TO GET IN THERE TIGHT AND NOT AFFECT THE BALLOONS BUT GET GREAT SHOTS. IT IS ALMOST UNCOMFORTABLE HOW CLOSE HE GETS. YOU CAN SEE THE WHITE OF HIS EYES IN THERE. >> ANOTHER TOP PIECE OF THE TEAM GETTING THE HELICOPTER IN THE SPOT AT THE RIGHT TIME. >> SO MOVING PARTS. I EXPECT BETWEEN US, EXPECTED TO GET MORE INTENSE AS WE GET CLOSE TO LAUNCH. >> COME LOOSE, DAVID, JUST FOR A SECOND. >> BALANCE IT? >> TITAN BACKUP. TITAN IT BACK UP.>> I CAN MAKE . >> YOU CAN PUT THAT SAME ONE, RIGHT? THIS ONE? THIS HAS TO GO OVER THE EAR THOUGH, DOESN'T IT? >> IT DOES. >> NOT TO HAVE MORE PRESSURE, BUT DON SAYS WE DEFTLY NEED TO KEEP MOVING. >> AND WE ARE. >> WHAT IS THE TIME? >> AIRTIME IS AS SOON AS YOU ARE READY. >> REALLY? WHAT TIME IS AT NOW? >> RIGHT NOW IT IS 7:20. WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF TO DO STILL OUT THERE. I WILL CHECK THE PARACHUTES, EVERYTHING SAFETY WISE. AND AS SOON AS YOU GUYS ARE READY AND COMFORTABLE, LET'S MOVING. >> I THINK THIS IS INCHES. I THINK IT IS FINE. >> IT WILL BE. >> STAND COME I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU WANT THAT. GOT IT. >> THIS CAME UP WE JUST HOOKED IT TO THIS. IT KEEPS IT WARM. AND THEN THIS, READY TO GO, THIS IS TIGHT, THIS IS TIGHT, THIS IS TIGHT. SAFETY IS GOOD. THAT IS TIGHT. THAT IS TIGHT. YOU ARE GOOD. >> OVER EVERYTHING. >> I HAVE FAITH. RIGHT? >> JUST TAKE IT OUT. I THINK WE WILL PUT IT BACK AND, TAKE IT OUT AND WE WILL PUT IT RIGHT? BACK IN. >> JUST TAKE IT OUT AND WE WILL PUT IT BACK IN. WE WILL GET THIS OUT IN A SECOND, HOLD ON, PERFECT. >> NOW WE ARE READY FOR THE CHURCH. WE NEED TO CHECK? PERFECT. >> IT'S ALL BEEN THE SAME. >> YES, IT IS. LUKE. >> ONE MORE TIME. >WHERE IS -- YOU GOT THAT? >> YOU CAN HEAR THAT? >> WHAT? >> THIS. >> THAT YOUR BATTERY. >> WE WILL WALK HIM AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. >> AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE IS GOOD. >> OVER THE TOP. >> HEY, DAVID, WE ARE STILL GOOD WITH THE WEATHER. IT WAS REALLY CALM FOR THE FIRST 2,000 FEET. SO WE ARE STILL GOOD ON TIMING. WE ARE GOOD. >> ARE YOU SURE? >> WE DON'T NEED TO GO LONGER THAN WE NEED TO BUT RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING IS GOOD WITH THE WEATHER. WHAT IS THE LATEST TIME YOU WANT TO HAVE HIM GO UP BECAUSE I KNOW WE ARE LOOKING GOOD ON TIME. >> RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOOD ON TIME. THE WEATHER IS HOLDING. WE HAVE A STABLE, THICK COLUMN OF CALM WINDS AND WE LET A HIGHBALL BALLOON GLOW. FIRST THOUSAND FEET THE BALLOON BARELY MOVED WHICH IS STRAIGHT UP JUST LIKE WE EXACTLY WANT TO >> A LITTLE TEST BALLOON. SEE. BIKO AS THE GROUND WARMS UP, ADDING LOCATION WITH THE ASPHALT AND CONCRETE, THAT WILL WARM UP THE AIR AND THE AIR WILL START TO MOVE. THE LATER WE GO END, THE MORE THE WINDS WILL PICK UP. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE EXACTLY WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN TERMS OF TIMING AND I THINK THE WINDS WILL HOLD. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE NEED EXTRA TIME AND WE ARE AFTER THE WINDOW WE WANT? >> OKAY IN THAT SITUATION WE HELP MOTHER NATURE OR COOPERATE IN THESE NICE, CALM WEDNESDAY MANAGEABLE. WE BRING BACK 5 MILES AN HOUR WIND. AS LONG AS WE STAY UNDER 5 MILES PER HOUR, SAFE ASCENT, SAFE LANDING AND WE START TO GET TO 5-6 MILES AN HOUR AND WE START TO GET CONCERNED. OKAY, THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> WHEN YOU GUYS WALKED DAVID OUT, WE WILL WALK AS FAR EAST ON THE ASPHALT AS WE CAN GO. EAST TOWARDS THE PLATEAU. >> THE ONE THING THAT MAY HAPPEN IS GET A FEEL WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE. IF YOU GRAB THIS ONE, YOU WILL PULL AND PULL AND PULL. YOU HAVE TO TIGHTEN THEM UP. >> THAT IS PERFECT. >> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? >> THESE GUYS ARE STILL WORKING ON IT. >> ALMOST DONE. >> YOU WANT DAVID TO DO THAT? >> HANG ON. I GOT THIS. >> DAVID THIS IS -- [RADIO STATIC] >> I NEED THE CUTTER AS WELL, BUT WE WILL GET THAT. >> YOU WILL GET THAT ON THE D DECK. >> A LITTLE BIT. I HEAR YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE. QUIT PLAYING WITH THESE THINGS. WHAT IS GOING ON? HOLD ON. I HEAR IT IS LOW. IS IT GOOD? HOLD ON, WAIT, I'M IN. TALK AGAIN. I HEARD YOU SAY IT'S LOW. I GOT YOU IN MY LEFT EAR NOW. BUT I HAVE TWO THINGS, A RIGHT AND A LEFT. WHO ARE IN MY LEFT AND IT'S QUIET. YEAH MY HEAR YOU IN MY RIGHT N NOW. YEAH. >> TOLD THEM THEY HAVE EMPOWERED THE BEST YET. AND I CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL HE STANDS UP. >> WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE STOPS GOING ON RIGHT NOW, PUTTING ONTO VEST POWERING IT UP AND GET THE BOOT ON WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT. AND I LOOKED UP A COUPLE MORE YOUTUBE QUESTIONS. I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER THEM BASED ON THE TIME SPENT AROUND THE EXPERTS AND WE WILL SEE HOW I MIGHT HAVE TO CALL THEM OVER. THEY GO. SO ONE OF THEM WEAR TO THE BLENDS GO? WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT HE WILL GET TO? THAT MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR LUKE BUT WE ARE LOOKING OVER 10000-15000 FEET. PRETTY HIGH. AGAIN, WHAT ARE THE VARIABLE THINGS I CAN CHANGE WHILE DAVID IS IN THE AIR THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR? >> BASICALLY, DON IS IN CHARGE OF WHETHER I WILL HAVE AN EYE ON WHAT WINDS ARE DOING AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS SO AS HE ASCENDED INTO DIFFERENT WIND BANDS, THAT CAN CHANGE. THE WINDS CAN PICK UP AND WE CANNOT SEE IT UNTIL IT PICKS UP. HOW WILL HE DETACH FROM THE BALLOONS? >> HE HAS A SERIES OF HOOKS AND IS HANGING ON ATTACHED TO THE BLENDS BUT HE GETS THE PARACHUTE DOWN AND ATTACHES TO THE OUTCOME WITHIN A SPECIAL SET OF INSTRUCTIONS TO UNHOOK AND BASICALLY LET GO OF THE BLENDS, WHICH IS KIND OF WILD, BUT THAT IS WHAT I HAVE SEEN. WHAT ARE THE MAIN CHALLENGES OF PARACHUTING? I HAVE NEVER PARACHUTED, BUT I'M GOING TO GUESS IT IS LANDING. I'M GOING TO GUESS IT'S COMING DOWN, PICKING YOUR SPOT. WE HAVE A LOOP WHO HAS DONE 20,000 DRUMS, WHICH IS AMAZING SO HE COMES DOWN SUPERFAST, PICA SPOT AND LANCE. BUT AS YOU ARE COMING DOWN YOU LOCK YOUR EYES ON A SPOT ON THE HORIZON AND A COUPLE OF RULE OF THUMB TO TRY TO HIT THAT SPOT. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO COME DOWN TO STEEP OR TOO SHALLOW. JUST AS YOU LAND, WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOOD LANDINGS ON YOUTUBE AND YOU CAN WATCH THOSE BUT GENERALLY, I THINK IT IS THE LANDING. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF SOME BALLOONS POP SOMEONE WANTS TO KNOW? THINK THE NUMBER ONE THING WE THERE IS ALWAYS THAT RISK AND I HAVE IS THE CONTROL CENTER WHICH CAN COUNTERACT THAT BY DROPPING WEIGHT. SO THEY CAN ALREADY DECIDE THE TOP OF A BALLOON IF THEY WANT HIM TO WRITE SLOWER OR DESCEND. AND WHEN A BALLOON POPS BY ACCIDENT AND STARTS TO GO DOWN, THEY CAN DROP SOME OF THAT WEIGHT WHICH THEY CALL BALLAST AND HE WILL START TO EVEN OUT AND GO BACK UP HERE THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. I DON'T THINK THEY WILL POP BY ACCIDENT OR AT LEAST I DON'T HOPE SO. ONE MORE, HOW CLOSE IS THE CHOPPER TO DAVID? GREAT QUESTION. IT LOOKS REALLY CLOSE. WE HAVE DONE LIKE TEST RUNS, FLYING THE HELICOPTER RUN. APPEAR THAT SWEET CAMERA ON THE FRONT. BY THE WAY, THE RED CAMERA AND THERE IS A SWEET, LONG LENS. THEY GET PRETTY CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE WHEN HE GETS UP THERE HOW CLOSE THE HELICOPTER GETS. GETTING THE LAST COUPLE OF LAYERS ON. HE HAS THIS CAMERA THAT CAN EITHER TWIST AROUND TO TO FACE HIM OR FACE THE CREW AND THERE WILL BE CAMERAS AND THE BALLOON THAT PAYS HIM FROM SUPER FAR AWAY. SO WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD VIEW AS HE IS ACTUALLY RISING UP ATTACHED TO THE BALLOONS OF WHAT HE IS SEEING AND HOW HIGH HE GETS AND HOW CLOSE THE HELICOPTER GETS. >> DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE? TIME. >> I'VE GOT THIS NOW. >> SO WE'VE ALREADY DOUBLED CHECKED THE HARNESS AND EVERYTHING ALL THE WAY UP. EVERYTHING IS COVERED UP RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE DOUBLE CHECKED. >> OKAY. >> IT WILL BE FLOPPING WHEN I JUMP. >> ARE WE GOING TO ATTACH THIS? >> NO, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO. >> LEAVE IT LIKE THIS. WHERE IS THE BUTTON? >> DO YOU HEAR IT CLICKING? >> DO YOU HEAR ME? HELLO? >> THIS IS THE AVIATION. >> THAT IS THE BACKUP BACKUP. >> THIS IS THE BACKUP BACKUP. THIS IS THE ONE WE ARE TALKING TO. >> DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXEMPT ALL THE WAY. >> YOU SHOULD ATTACK THIS HERE TOO. WATCH YOUR NECK BONE. >> BUT THEY JUST VESTED M. >> AS SOON AS THE PARACHUTE GOES ON. >> THEY ARE TELLING ME JUST TO WAIT. IT'S GOING TO COME OUT. >> INSIDE OF THAT. >> YOU CAN'T HEAR NOTHING FROM ME, NO? >> NO. >> I DON'T HEAR LUKE AT ALL. I DON'T HEAR LUKE AT ALL. >> HE CAN'T HEAR ME. >> SHOULD I TAKE THE OTHER ONE OUTCOME OF THE ONE FOR THE SHOW? JUST LEAVE IT THE SECOND BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY WAY WE CAN TALK TO YOU. >> I AM IN THE SHADE. >> WE ARE GOOD. WE ARE GO TO. >> WHEN HE DOES THE RADIO. >> HEY, DAVID. >> CAN YOU STAND ON THE SCALE? >> DAVID, CAN YOU HAVE THIS RADIO? >> THAT IS THE BACKUP RADIO. THAT IS THE ONE. >> THANK YOU, SIR. >> BERT, ARE WE SKIPPING THE HANDOFF AND KISS AND GO? I JUST GIVE A KISS AND GO? I DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO HAND OFF, RIGHT? >> I WILL GIVE YOU A 5-GALLON, UNFORTUNATELY. >> I WONDER IF WE CAN JUST PUT IT -- >> THAT MEANS WE ARE PRETTY CLOSE. THEY EXACT CALIBRATION FOR EVERYTHING. DON, HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW? >> NOW IT'S STARTING TO GET CRAZY. NOW IT'S STARTING TO BECOME REAL. >> DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE PRESHOW WAS DIFFERENT? I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE BY FAR. IF YOU TAKE EVERYTHING I'VE DONE, EVERY ENDURANCE THING, EVERY STUNNED MATTER ALL THOSE TOGETHER, COMBINED THOSE AND THIS FEELS WAY CRAZIER BY A LONG SHOT. THIS FEELS INSANE. >> IT SURE IS. I THINK WE ARE MINUTES AWAY. >> NORMALLY I FEEL LIKE I HAVE CONTROL LIBERAL MICHAEL FOR EVERYTHING. THAT'S WHEN I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ANYTHING. >> >> I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF YOUR WAY NOW AND I THINK WE WILL HAVE A LUNCH PRETTY SOON. >> THANK YOU, MARCUS. THIS ONE FEELS CRAZY. >> IT LOOKS CRAZY. >> FEEL GOOD? >> I FEEL REALLY GOOD. >> SO THESE THINGS WILL BE HERE. AND ONCE IT IS UNDER HERE, THEN I'M HERE APPEAR AND SPEAK WITH THE SMALL ONES AND THOSE ARE THE ONES WE WILL DO ON THE DECK. >> JUST A LITTLE. >> HEY, NOODLES. I WANT TO MAKE SURE. >> THIS. I DON'T CARE. I COULD CARE LESS. >> I HEAR YOU, LUKE. I HEAR YOU IN BOTH YEARS NOW. >> PERFECT. TAKE THE LITTLE ONE. >> PERFECT. CAN I HAVE A SMALL SIP OF WATER, MAY BE. I FEEL GOOD. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. OH, YEAH, WE NEED THOSE. >> YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW. >> I WILL PUT THE L TENDERS ON. >> UNDERNEATH? >> YEAH. IT IS ALLOWED, WHICH IS GOOD. OKAY, THIS ONE I WILL PUT RIGHT HERE. RIGHT? AND THEN THIS ONE, I WILL PUT ABOVE IT. IT CAN'T HURT. NO? >> IT CAN'T HURT UNLESS YOU CATCH IT ON YOUR ARM TRYING TO REACH BACK TO PUT IN THE RIG WHICH IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I DON'T WANT TO DO TOO MUCH ON YOUR WRIST. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHEN YOU PUT YOUR RIGHT ARM THROUGH AND THEN YOU PUT YOUR LEFT ARM, YOU ARE REACHING BACK LIKE THIS AND TRYING TO HOOK IT. JUST BE CONSCIOUS THIS CAN HOOK ON IT. THAT IS ALL. >> I WILL KEEP IT UNDER MY SLEEP. >> YEAH, THAT'S GREAT. JUST TO CONFIRM IT. >> THIS WHEN I CAN KEEP IN MY POCKET OR SOMETHING. >> IF YOU THINK THE OTHER ONE IS NOT WORKING, SURE, IN YOUR POCKET. AND JUST IN CASE. LET'S SAY ALL OF THEM DID NOT WORK AND YOU FREE FALL. WHAT WILL YOU DO? >> OPEN AT 125. >> PERFECT COME I LOVE IT. ONE MORE LOOK, THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE WHEN YOU OPEN AND YOU WERE LOOKING BACK. YOU SEE THE CITY, THE CITY STANDS OUTCOME OF THE TOWERS. THE CITY, THIS IS YOU OPEN AND YOUR HEAD. >> I'M TRYING TO LAND WHERE? >> RIGHT WHERE THIS THING IS. SO FOR SOME REASON IF I'M GOING EAST THIS WAY, BUT IF I SEE THIS, THEN I'M PROBABLY GOING TO. >> YOUR GRADE. YOU WILL SEE THIS TOWER, THIS LITTLE POND RIGHT HERE AND YOU WILL LAND ON THE RISE. SO THAT IS ABOUT YOU FLYING IN. JUST LIKE THAT. RIGHT IN. THAT IS THE PLAN. DON'T OVER THINK IT. YOU HAVE THE SKILLS. >> WE HAVE 10 MINUTES TO LAUNCH, DON'T WE? >> DO YOU HAVE THE PULSE OX WITH YOU? LET'S SWITCH THAT. WHAT ABOUT GLOVES? >> PUT THAT IN THERE. >> SO YOU CAN TALK TO ME AND I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING IS GREAT. >> SO YOU GUYS ARE GOOD? YOU GUYS HANG OUT HERE AND EVERYBODY, YOU GUYS GOOD? HANG OUT A SECOND, I WILL CALL YOU ON THE SECOND AND HANG OUT IN THE SHADE. WE ARE GETTING CLOSE. EVERYBODY ELSE THERE IS READY? >> ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. MAKE SURE YOU SAND CHECK YOUR GLASSES. >> NOT TOO TIGHT BECAUSE THE THING WILL PULL OUT. IS IT LOOSE? THAT IS GREAT. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE. >> AND I NEED A BALLOON, THAT IS A RIGHT. >> DO YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU ONE? DO YOU WANT ONE RIGHT THERE? >> THE ORANGE ONE. NO, THAT LITTLE BLUE ONE DESSA. >> THE LITTLE BLUE ONE. >> SO DAVID, THE ONLY THING -- >> YEAH. >> WHEN YOU GRAB THAT LINE FOR THE PARACHUTE, YOU HOLD ONTO THAT LINE. >> DON'T LET GO OF IT. >> BECAUSE IF ANYTHING, YOU HAVE TO HOLD ONTO IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? JUST BE CONSCIOUS, WHEN YOU PULL IT DOWN, EVERY SINGLE STROKE ALL THE WAY DOWN. AND WE WILL REMIND YOU. >> YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THAT. >> ANY OTHER NOTES? BUT YOU WILL BE IN MY EAR AS WELL. >> FOR SURE. >> JUST WAIT UNTIL LUKE CALLS US. >> HERE YOU GO, DAVID TO. >> WAIT, OH, PERFECT. WAIT, I FORGET. >> BUT FOR YOU, LIKE AND HOW MANY -- LIKE HOW MANY HOURS? >> LIKE AN HOUR. >> AND THEN WHAT? >> STAYED WITH THE GROUP. >> ELECTRICITY AND THE WATER. >> WE SHOULD GO SOON BECAUSE THOSE BALLOONS ARE HEATING UP HEATING UP. >> OKAY. >> OH, NO, IS THAT OKAY? >> YEAH. >> LET'S GO.

TELL US AGAIN HOW TO SAY IT. [SPEAKING A NATIVE TONGUE] >> I WILL SAY IT ONCE MYSELF. >> LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS. [SPEAKING IN NATIVE TONGUE] >> POLAR PEOPLE OF THE SKY AND THE EARTH, THAT THE SURFACE OF MOTHER EARTH, WE ASK FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR BROTHER, DAVID BLAINE, AS HE MAKES THIS ESSENTIAL. AND WE KNOW THAT HE WILL COMPLETE THIS IN BEAUTY AND BEAUTY IS IN HIM AND BEAUTY IS ALL AROUND HIM. AND SO WE PRAY THAT WITH YOUR HELP, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE JOY, HAPPINESS, CONFIDENCE, AND PEACE BEFORE HIM. JOY, HAPPINESS, PEACE BEHIND HIM. JOY, HAPPY, PEACE BELOW HIM. JOY, HAPPINESS, CONFIDENCE, AND PEACE ABOVE HIM.

I WANT TO GRAB A BUNCH OF BALLOONS AND FLY AS HIGH AS A JET. IT MIGHT SEEM SIMPLE, BUT IN REALITY, THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS RISKS. IF THERE IS A BALLOON FAILURE BEFORE I PUT ON MY PARACHUTE, I CAN GO CRASHING TO THE GROUND. >> IF HE DOESN'T PUT ON HIS PARACHUTE, HE DIES. >> SWITCH, NO, NO! >> FOR ME THE MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THIS IS LANDING SAFELY. >> SHUT IT DOWN ALL THE WAY! >> I'VE NEVER HAD TO LAND ON TERRAIN THIS DIFFICULTY IN MY LIFE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME COME I'M SO EXCITED TO PULL THIS OFF. >> WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? >> I HAD TO SHOVE IT WAY DEEP. YEAH. YOU MIGHT ALWAYS HAVE TO MESS WITH A LITTLE BIT.
