-[camera shutter clicking] -[photographer] Smile, beautiful, very nice. And let's bring Kristi in a little closer. Okay. Kristi, right here, sweetheart looking in the camera. And smiling... very nice. -Don?t they look beautiful? -Yeah. No one would ever know that we are at the worst photographer?s studio in Brooklyn. Ok. good. Looks like we have some alternatives to offer. -You headed back to the office? -Yep. I have my pitch session with Helen. It has taken me six months to get her to let me out of assistant prison and consider me as a feature writer. -You?ve got this. You were the editor of your campus paper. You won the Colberry Award. You?ve got all the skills. -Yeah, I feel good about it. These wedding shoots are exhausting. Like actual weddings. -Ooop! -Oh. Hey. -Oh, my goodness. Can I help you? -Careful. Oh, there's a... there's a string... [phone ringing] One of the brides? -Yep, bride number two. Michelle. Lawyer, very detail-oriented. Sorry, can I? -Ok. -Hey, Michelle. Yes, I think pink peonies are a perfect substitute for dahlias. Mmhm. Sure. No problem. I just stepped inside the elevator though so this call may drop. [elevator dings] -Yeah. Sure, no problem. Ok, I?ve gotta go Michelle. No, lime isn?t a disgusting color at all. Yeah, it?ll be fine. Ok, I?ve gotta go. Great, I?ll see you tonight. Love you. [exhales] -You gotta get in there, Trish. If you?re late it?s gonna take six months to get another meeting. -[exhales] Ok. Here I go. -Do it yourself spa treatment? No. Candle making as a voyage of self-discovery. No. Colonics as a component of your meditation practice. Hard no. -I have other... Uh, what about... -Please, stop, before you kill again. All of these are variations on articles we?ve done over the past few months, Trish. I haven?t just heard these ideas before, I?ve actually published them already. -I was trying to stay on brand. -Listen, if you want to move from executive assistant to feature writer- -And I desperately do. Becoming a writer has been my soul focus for years so I... -And write big stories, personal stories, then why are you pitched me yesterday?s material? Aren?t you leaving in a few hours for three weeks off? -Yes, but that doesn?t mean that I can?t blue sky some new ideas for you. -And you?re going to a wedding, is that right? -Three weddings actually over three consecutive weekends. All of my best friends form high school are getting married in the same month and I am a bridesmaid at each of them. If you can believe that. [chuckles nervously] [awkward music] Uh... You did approve the time off and Dani can fill in but I am just a phone call away if you need any... -This is it. -What? No, no, um, I... I love my job, I can call my friends if you would just... -Trish, I?m not firing you. I?m telling you this is it. This is your piece. -It is? -Absolutely! Three friends, three weddings. The changes in their lives. Opening up a new chapter. All seen through the person closest to them. Weddings are evergreen pieces for us . The piece will be a little ?always a bridesmaid, never a bride.? -[Dani] You don't even like weddings. -[Trish] Not a fan of the wedding industrial complex. -This is like sending Scrooge in to review It?s a Wonderful Life -Thank you. -But how?s this any different than anything else that we publish? It?s not like you?re particularly into spa treatments but you?re willing to write about those. -I don?t know. It?s just different. -That?s an excellent answer for someone who wants to be an investigative journalist. Who?s gonna be your date for all these weddings anyway? -Ok, I am a strong, independent, 21st century woman. I do not need a date just because I happen to be going to a wedding. -Three weddings. And I predict that you will not have a minute to write because you?ll spend all your time fending off setups. There?s something about weddings that make people crazy to couple everybody up. It?s like they put something in the red velvet cake. -Great, can?t wait. -Mmhm. -Alright, wish me luck. I?ll call you when I get there. -This is not gonna end pretty. [cheerful music] -Peterson? -Paterson! There you are! [laughing] Finally! -Put me down, Peterson. I am a respected magazine journalist. -Not here you?re not. Here you?re still the same Trish Paterson who set the Hillside record for most consecutive days off after school detention for talking back to teachers. -Ok, that was totally unjust and I said so in the school paper. -Mm. Which led to, what was it again? Oh yes, more detentions. -Ok, ok, maybe not the best strategy but I did feel like I had justice on my side. -Well, you?re never in detention here. Come on. You're writing your first feature about our weddings, Trish, that?s amazing. You?ve been working for this for.. -Years. Literally. Yes. -Hey. You?re gonna have to get everyone to agree. That's not gonna be a problem with... -June and Peter. -June and Peter. Right, they'll love it. And of course Laurel and I will always support you. -Oh, thanks. You guys are always there for me. -But that does leave.. -Michelle. -Michelle. -Yeah. -I mean, Rod?s gonna do whatever she says. But she?s gonna see all the downsides. -I know. And that?s why I need you to help me with her. -Ok, so I love you, you?re my best friend but you?re on your own there. Particularly since I?m not gonna be around. -What do you mean "not around"? -One last business trip out west before the wedding. Hey, believe me, not my choice, but the boss is giving me a whole month off- -Hold on, hold on, hold on. That means that I?m gonna be on my own as I go through all this wedding stuff? You can?t do that to me, Peterson. -Ok, I thought of that and I have a solution. My brother Ryan?s coming to town, he?ll be the perfect wingman for you. -I don?t need a wingman. I just went through this. I don?t need a date just because I?m going to a wedding. -Hey, three weddings. Come on, you?d be doing me a favor. He?s kind of at loose end. -Well I never really knew him. I mean, he was gone pretty much by the time we started hanging out. What part of the world is he flying in from this time? -Uh, Mozambique? Mauritania, Morocco. I can?t keep track anymore. -Wait, so, how does Laurel feel about you taking off like this? -Oh, she understands. -Uh huh. Well, thanks again for letting me stay here. -Of course. -Hey, when do your parents get in? I?m excited to see them. -I actually heard from Mom this morning and unfortunately Dad?s stuck on the base so it looks like they won't be able to make it till the day before the wedding. Which means that it?s going to be just you and Ryan till then, -That is totally fine. The beauty of this place will make up for the massive ego I?ll be dealing with. [chuckles) Come on, let?s get you settled in the guest house then hustle over to the party, huh? -Alright. -Yes! [car beeps] -[party music] -[overlapping chatter] -Hi! Sorry, I?m sorry. Blame this guy. Stopped by to change my work clothes and suddenly were having an epic catch up. -Sure, sure, just like that time we got caught climbing on the roof of the gym. Now all of a sudden it's my idea, right Paterson? -Because it was totally your idea, Peterson. -Honestly, is it too much to ask you two to refer to each other by your first names just for this event? -I don't know, it?s pretty deeply ingrained at this point. -Yeah, I think we've been calling each other that since... -Mrs. Donahue?s class? -Freshman year. -Yeah. -This girl with the bright pink neon backpack sits down next to me. -This goofy guy with a bowl cut says ?hello Paterson, I?m Peterson.? -Pretty much inseparable after that. -Trisha Paterson! It?s about time. -Oh, it?s so good to see you. -Hi! -Hey, Trish. -Oh, leaning into that rock and roll fairy tale theme I see. -Yup. -I know. We?ve raided every vintage shops all the way from here to Boston just to find these jackets. Oh, and I have a long list of thrift stores I want to hit. Will you be my wing-woman? -Of course. -That is just the beginning because there are wine tastings, bridesmaid fitting, reception rehearsals and then the weddings themselves. You are going to be busy. -I can?t wait. -Oh, um, heads up, I think we?re all about to be cross-examined. -Michelle. -There you are. Hey, girl, listen, I?ve been working on a seating chart and I wanted to make sure that you didn?t have some imaginary boyfriend that isn?t gonna show up at the last minute. Now, if you don?t have anyone I could pair you with one of the interns from Rod?s hospital. -Future wife here always has a contingency plan. -'Cause I know how embarrassing it can be where the only one seated on your own when everyone else has a partner. -Uh, why don?t we cut Trish some slack, Michelle? She?s overwhelmed with bridesmaid duties. -Did my sensitivity chip go offline? -Uh, a little bit. -I am sorry. I totally get it. I mean, Rod barely got his shift covered for this party, so no pressure. It?s just a logistics thing, ok? -Thanks for understanding. How?s work for you? -Insane. It?s insane. They have me on the partner track and the hours are brutal but I love it. What are you working on? -Well, why don?t we take a seat, we?ll get a drink. Go sit down. -[Laurel] Ok. -[Sean] Let?s go. -You know, I saw all of my carefully constructed ideas go down in flames. But then, my editor suggested I was missing something that was right in front of me. All of you. -Wait, what does that mean? -Us? -Well, she mentioned that this is a pretty unique situation, you know, three weddings all in three weeks. And that it had huge potential for a feature article. It would be my first major piece. -Oh! That is so exciting! -Yes! -No. -Uh, why not, Michelle? -Well, for one thing, what?s this story actually about? -Well, it would be about, you know, how friends have managed to stay close since high school and... -Which is all because of you, because you?re the glue that keeps us all together. -You guys remember the night of the graduation bonfire when she made us all sign an oath to come back to the same place every summer. -Ok, you?re all just lucky that we didn?t go to June?s idea of poking our fingers and signing in blood. -I am just saying that if you?re going to sign a pact then you should sign a pact. -You know what I?m talking about, Trish. Is this article gonna make us all look ridiculous? -No, of course not. I would never do that to any of you. This is supposed to be a positive piece about the, you know, best day of your life... or lives. -Why did they assign this article to you? -Well, because I know you all so well. -No, I mean, why did they think that you could write well about weddings? You?re allergic to the subject. -I just think that they can be... a little too commercial sometimes. -It is a little odd, is all. -Remember when you said that marriage was the only time you needed a license to go to prison? -Did I say that? -Yeah. -Okay. -What would we have to do? -Nothing much. Really, I would just be taking notes and writing about our group. Yeah, maybe an interview or two, but you wouldn?t really have to do anything. And this absolutely will not interfere with my bridesmaid duties, I can promise you that. -Ok, come on Michelle. Like, what do you have to lose? -I guess you can?t do it without Rod and I. -Not really. I mean, it's sort of the concept behind the whole thing. Three couples, three weddings. -Come on, Michelle. -Michelle, come on! Ok, we can be famous! -We need you! -Alright. Alright. -Yes! -You have to paint us in a good light, promise? -I promise. -The deal is done! -Thank you, guys. This means a lot. -Ok, you know what, enough of this. I think it is time to dance. -Let's go. -Us too. Watch your step Been waiting for a girl like you To be my sunrise Been waiting for a girl like you To light up my night Been waiting for a girl like you With fire in her eyes Been waiting for a girl like you To light up my life I've been waiting for a lifetime for somebody so true - I thought that I was finished now I'm starting new. How exciting it was to see all of my friends together on the dance floor, poised on the cliff of marriage. No, that's not right. Precipices? Overhang? Sheer drop? Hi, a glass of pinot noir, please? -[whispering] Trish. Trish. -Hey, Peter. -Hey. -What?s up? -Take this. -"I Love You Alone" by Sheryl Townsend? -Yeah, it?s the song June and I first danced to at the spring dance our freshman year. Don?t you remember? -To be honest, no. -Then June went and bought me the record. This classic vintage record. So, I want it to be a surprise for our first dance at the reception. Could you hold onto it for me like you?re the ring bearer? Yeah, I want to be sure it?s a real surprise for June when the needle drops. -Sure. No problem. -Great! Yes. Ok, um, I better get back before June wonders why I?ve disappeared. -Thank you! -Ok. -Trish! So happy! -Hi, Carrie. -I was desperate for someone fun to talk to. Oh, hey, who are you bringing to the wedding? I?ve got this guy, George, I?m not sure if he?s the one, but he does have a timeshare. -Timeshare is nice. -Oh, hey, my cousin Todd needs a date. My aunt says he?s been playing way too much World of Warcraft lately. -Why does everyone keep asking me if I have a date? -Sorry, was just trying to help. -No, I?m sorry. I didn?t mean to jump on you like that. I?ve just been getting that question a lot lately. -We just don?t want you to be sad, Trish. -It just so happens, I actually do have someone accompanying me to the weddings. -To all three? Do I know him? -Um... You might. -Ryan! -Hey! -Hi! -There he is. -You made it, brother! -Oh, my... [needle scratch] -Sorry. -I don?t know how he does it, but Ryan Peterson always manages to make an entrance. -Mmhm. -[Carrie] He's still got it. -Well? -What? -Aren?t you going to go say hi to your boyfriend? -Oh, he?s not my boyfriend. He's... Um, you know what? I?m gonna put this away. -Trish? I thought that might be you. -Ryan. -It?s been a long time. -Hi, Ryan. Uh, let?s go dance. I have been looking for peace of my mind... Sorry, I, uh, wanted to get away from certain eyes. They know that we?re gonna be each other?s date to these things, and I didn?t want a thousand questions. -These things? -The weddings. -Ah, I?m overwhelmed with your sentimentality. I?m happy to help. -It?s no big deal. I would have figured it out for myself. So, uh, how?s Mozambique? -No idea. I?m sure it?s nice but not as amazing as Morocco. -Morocco. Yes. -Right, right. -I was misinformed. I saw your spread of New Zealand on the Nat Geo website. It was really cool. Looked like another planet. -Glad to see you two are catching up. -Did Trish tell you she?s writing a story about our friend group for her magazine? -You got everyone to agree? -Even Michelle. -Impressive. You going to include the part about your date being someone you barely remember from high school? -I might leave that part out. Thanks for the dance. -Paterson, I?m taking off. Just so you know. -Thanks, betrayer who?s betrayed me. -You're up early. Working on your article? -Are you kidding? Do you know how many events you guys have planned? I may never sleep again. You only have to be at one wedding, I have to attend all three. Ok, I?m like in some wedding zombie movie where the undead just keep coming and coming. -Did you just compare the happiest day of my life to a zombie movie? Aww. -[Sean] Hey. -Hey, guys. Working on your piece? -And that?s my cue to take off. I?ll catch you two cool cats in a couple weeks. -Alright. Have a good trip. -Thanks. -Hey, I uh, actually wanted to apologize for last night. -About what? -Well, I kind of object to how everyone thinks I need a date to these weddings, so I was a little abrupt with you, so sorry about that. -No need for an apology. Totally get it. Maybe we should just drop everything. -We?ll attend the weddings, but separately. -Okay then. -Done. -Good. -Great. -Shoot, I gotta run. I have to be at a bridal shower in an hour. -Don?t those usually happen weeks before the wedding? -Yeah, but no one was in town. [crunch] No! No, no, no, no, no.... Uh. I blame you for this. -What did I do? -This is June and Peter?s special record that they were gonna play for their first dance tomorrow. Now look at it. [sighs] -This look very rare. -Yeah, apparently. Well, I guess I?ll just have to download the song now. -You don?t really understand weddings, do you? -What? Sure, I do. -No, because if you did you?d understand it?s the only day where you try to get everything absolutely everything right. Ok, there?s no compromises. No cutting corners. You?re gonna have to find another copy before their first dance. -I don?t have time for that. I have a wedding shower to attend. -Then you?ll have to make an excuse and get away. And since I feel somewhat responsible, I will help you. I?m thinking that we meet on the corner of Main and Junction in an hour and a half. -Are you serious? -Main and Junction. Hour and a half. [upbeat music] -Hey! -Oh thank goodness you?re here. I need your help. Um, can you hand these out to everyone? Everyone has to take a party favor token. And you either get a session with the palm reader or a foot massage. -Got it. -I?m so excited you and Ryan are going to the wedding together. He?s so handsome. -Yeah, he?s gonna age badly though, I can tell. [laughs] -Oh! Palm reader. Maybe I can tell your fortune. -I think it would be weird if my fortune was written on your palm, but, ok. -Hey, when did you and Ryan decide to go to weddings together? -We didn?t really decide. Actually, it was kind of your fianc?s idea. But, uh, we?re changing that. We?re gonna go separately now. -So you?re gonna arrive separately but sit together? -Yeah. That?s the plan. -You know what they say about the best laid plans. -That they always work out perfectly? -Oooh! Yay! Who doesn?t love a good foot massage. -Ugh. I?m always worried they?re gonna judge my pedicure. -Is there anything that you just sit back and enjoy? -Not really, no. -You?re talking to the girl who decided to wear all black her sophomore year. -Hey, that was a totally defensible fashion choice. Uh, but sorry to do this ladies, I actually have to bow out today. -What? -I know. I know. I have something I have to take care of. -What? -Why? -Yeah, but I?ll see you guys later. Have fun! -T? -But... -She hates Ryan, I can tell. -That girl needs a massage and some cookies. -Yes. [motorcycle motor running] -Of course you ride a motorcycle. -It?s Sean?s. I'm just borrowing it. So, I did a little googling and apparently any record by Sheryl Townsend is really hard to find. Especially an original pressing of a 45 single. -See, this is why I don?t like weddings. Everyone loses their mind about the littlest things. -Well, look at it this way, if we?re successful, maybe you?ll have something to write about. Let?s start with the record shop and thrift store. Maybe we?ll get lucky. -This is rare. -For sure. -Really rare! -I know. -If we had it, it would be over there. Alright, let's see what we got. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Nope. Sorry. No luck. -Is there anywhere you could recommend to look? -In this town? I don't know. Try the thrift store. But that?s a real Hail Mary. -Ok. -Great, thank you. -Alright. -No, it doesn?t have to be a 45. Could be on LP. Yeah, yeah, I?ll wait. Uh huh, yeah, that?s the one. Yeah, can you put it aside for us? Yep, great, great. No, money?s no concern. Thank you. -Money?s no concern? -So they have a copy. Only one. But it's too late to overnight it in time for the reception, so... -You?re sure that we can?t just apologize to Peter and June and get back to tacos and margaritas? -It?s impressive how hard you?re holding onto that cynicism. -Ok, I prefer to think of it as realism, not cynicism. -Come on, it?s the ritual. Every couple has their ritual or two, you know? Going back to the place they first met, listening to the song they first danced to. Love?s kind of a conspiracy against the world. Rituals we have prove that. -Fire in my mouth. -Oh, uh, buddy, she ate a habanero. Do you have any queso fundito? Cheesier the better. -Ah. Queso. I know that means cheese but oh, this is bad. -Yeah. -This is really bad. -Queso fundito, it?s a melted cheese skillet. The grease will help cut down the heat. I learned that in Jalisco. The locals there thought it was funny to add extra chilies to my tamales, so... Thank you, thank you so much. -Thanks. -It should start working any second. -Ok. -Yeah? -That actually helped. -Yeah? Better? Well I... I?m gonna head back to the city. -Oh, wait, no, I mean, I?m the one who broke it. I can be the one that goes to get it. -You?re a bridesmaid, Trish, you can?t disappear on the day of the wedding. Besides, the only way to make it on time is if I take the bike to beat the traffic, ok? -But it?s over five hours each way. You?ll be riding all night. -I will be alright, ok? Wish me luck. -You should mention how cool a curated playlist is as a party favor in your article. -Hm, it?s not that kind of piece. -I thought you wrote for a lifestyle magazine? -I do, it?s just uh, not really writing about the style of the weddings. I?m more interested in how the couples end up dealing with all the stresses and everything that come with them. -I totally agree. I wanted my wedding to Sean to be a calm oasis celebrating our love. Instead, I?m left handling everything on my own and sometimes it feels like an exhausting dumpster fire. -Hey. Are you alight? I should be helping you more. -You? No, you have too much on your plate already. It?s all good. Anyway, I like the sound of your article I?d ready it. -Great. That?s one so far. -Are you looking for someone? -No, no. I?m just, uh, you know, wondering when things are gonna get underway. -Hm. -[Female Voice] Everyone take your places, we are about to begin the ceremony. -There. Now you can relax. -Yeah. [curious music] -I have loved you since our very first dance. [sobbing] And, I just want to keep making beautiful music together. -[Minister] I now pronounce you husband and wife. -Woo! -[applause] -We're married! Ah! -Hey! -Hi. -Do you know if anyone?s seen Ryan? -Uh, he must be around here somewhere. [applause] Ah. [crowd cheering] [sighs] -I have to talk to Peter. [music starts] -Honey! You remembered? -Of course, babe. How could I forget? Come here. There is one thing I know I just, uh, love you so I love you -So what?s like your Mount Everest as a photographer? Or is it the actual Everest? It?s the actually Everest, isn?t it? -No, I've already done that. -[both chuckle] -Of course you have. Like riding motorcycles and wrestling alligators. -Well, my dream would be photographing the Aurora Australis. -Is it kind of like the Aurora Borealis? -Right, but in the southern hemisphere. It?s only visible a few months out of the year, very few photographers have had the chance to do it. But I?m uh, I?m hoping for the opportunity. -Well, it sounds spectacular. -Yeah, but I?m not holding my breath. I?ve been close so many times and there's always some sort of setback. The weather, the cost, the magazine doesn't think it's worthwhile... -So if you were to go, when would it be? -It could be anytime now. Like I said, it depends. I was supposed to go before, but my girlfriend at the time wasn?t very supportive. -What happened with this girlfriend? -We broke up because she didn?t want me to go, so. -Aren?t you two gonna go dance? George knows how much I love to dance. Don?t you, George? -Learning every day. Oh. -May I have this dance? -If you insist. -And now, it?s time for my beautiful bride to bestow the bouquet onto one lucky single lady. So, uh, everyone make your way to the centre of the floor. -Get in there, T. -Oh, no. Not my jam. -Do you want me to rescind my cooperation for your article? Get out there. -You must be a really good lawyer. -Go. -Ok. -Ready ladies? [cheering] One, two, three! -[cheering] -This is so going in the article. -[Trish] No, no. Not a step closer. -I?m sorry? -I know this is your house, I know I?m just a visitor here and that I have no right to say this, but I need you to not come any closer. -Ok. -I?m just, I?m never gonna get started on my piece if I don?t have some time on my own. Some silence. Sorry. -Well, I?ve got my own writing to do as best man. You won?t even know I?m here. [sighs] -Sorry, I feel like that was kind of rude to tell you you can?t step onto your own dock. -No worries. I totally get it. I have been struggling with this speech for weeks now. -You know... never mind. -What? -No, I don?t want to interfere. I?m always getting these ideas. It?s kind of a fault of mine. Trying to control everything. -I will let you know if you are interfering. -You?re not a writer, right? -No, definitely not. -Ok, so, why do a speech? You should do what comes naturally to you. What you?re good at. -[both] Photography. -Yeah. -I love that. I mean, it?s a little unconventional, but uh, you like to think outside the box, don?t you? -Sometimes. I am supposed to be at Michelle?s in 20 minutes. What is wrong with me? -Hm. -Too much going on. -[Trish] I wish I could pack like this. -You think this is impressive, you should see my shoe closet in the city. -Did you tell Trish about London? -Rod got offered a prime research position in London. -Oh. -It?s an amazing offer. I?ve always wanted to get into research. There?s way less wear on the body than being on call. Michelle and I are just trying to figure out if we can uproot our lives for it. -Or whether we do the long distance thing again. -It's just, I?m not sure when another opportunity like this will come up again. -I understand. It?s just, I have a career too and with the time difference and the legal system, I can?t do my job from London. -Well, maybe it?ll turn into an adventure. -Maybe. -You guys?ll figure it out. [phone ringing] Hey, Dani. -How?s the story coming? You gonna make your deadline? -Deadline? What deadline? Why are you whispering? Are you at work? -You need to turn in your story asap. -Why? Helen didn?t give me a hard deadline. I was actually gonna ask for a bit more time. -No! -What? Why? What?s going on? -[sighs] I wasn?t supposed to tell you this, but the August feature fell through. Helen?s looking at other stories and she hinted that she?s considering yours for the spot. -But I?m only one wedding in. -Did you hear me? Trish... it?s the feature. Remember when Renee got her first feature? It blew up and now Helen lets her write anything she wants. -True. -Come on, Trish, you can do this. This is what you?ve been working towards for years. Plus, it?ll be a break for me too because then I can take over your duties. Please. Focus. -Ok, yeah. You?re right. I just need to buckle down. No more distractions. I?m on it. [sighs] -Wine tasting party is an elegant way to start wedding festivities. You should put that in your article. -It?s not that kind of- Never mind. -Sorry, I was just trying to help. -I know. I just really need this story to be taken seriously. It's my chance to escape being an assistant. -So when you do get there, what kinds of stories will you write? -Stories that move people. surprise them. Maybe even challenge them. -Here. Try this one. It tastes like blackberries. -Oh, it does. Maybe I?ll buy a few bottles and bring them back to New York. -It?s not a bad idea. I might do the same. -Oh. -What? -You have a home? -[chuckles] What makes you think I don?t have a home? -Well, you?re like a citizen of the world. -Ok. -I don?t know. Sean always made it sound like you live between hotel rooms. -Well, I do, mostly. But I also have a small crash pad in New York. It?s become more of a storage unit for all my equipment, really. But I do pay rent there, so technically it is my home. -That sounds... Well, awful. I?m sorry, it does. -It?s not that bad. -Mm. -Ok, maybe it is. [chuckles] -Hi. -Hey, Mr. Fianc?, what?s up? -Can I just speak to her? -Speak to who? -Michelle, isn?t she with you? I thought she must be with you. -No, I?m supposed to meet June and write 10,000 thank you cards. -Michelle?s been missing since this morning. I?ve looked everywhere for her. -Oh. Ok, uh, let me try and I?ll call you when I reach her. -Please, the minute you do. And thanks, Trish, I appreciate it. -Of course. -[voicemail] Hey, it?s Michelle, leave a message. -Only you would know where to look. I might be a good lawyer but I think you?re gonna be an even better journalist. Remember we used to come out here when the boys were driving us crazy? -Yeah. -I guess nothing changes, huh? -I can leave you alone if that?s what you prefer, Michelle. -That's ok. But there?s something you should know. The wedding?s off. [typing] -Ok. Beekeeper, park ranger, private investigator... Life coach. Yeah, for sure not cut out for that one. Trish Paterson. There are three key attributes to choosing a good nail polish. [laughs] [door opens] -Are you sure this is ok? I just don?t think I can face going home tonight. -Oh, I?m sure Ryan won?t mind. -Ryan won?t mind what? -Uh, Michelle needs a place to stay tonight. Is it ok if she camps out in the spare room? -Of course. You know you?re always welcome here, Michelle. -Come on. -I?ll just be upstairs. -No, no, you should stay. It?s your house. -What happened? -So you know how my sensitivity chip can go offline sometimes. So Rod comes home from a particularity grueling day and I just blurt out, I don?t want to go to London with you. -Oh. -So, pretty quickly it turns into a heated argument and then Rod says to me that I?m being a control freak about the wedding. Of course I have been. This is what I do. He used to love that about me. I manage things. I took care of things. When did it change? So I get mad and then I say to him well, maybe we should just call the whole thing off? And then he says... maybe we should. [sighs] So, I think it?s off. -I?m so sorry, Michelle. -I can?t believe this is happening. -You said you both have been working really hard lately. It?s gotta just be the stress. -Absolutely. Stress. That?s it. -Yeah, I guess. -It?ll all pass by tomorrow. You know when you get into one of those arguments and it feels like the end of the world and then the next day you can?t even remember what you were fighting about? I?m sure it?s like that, right, Ryan? -Right, sure. -Yeah, it could be. But that... doesn?t change the fact that I don?t want to go to London. -[Trish] Get some rest. -Sure. Thank you. -Of course. Have a good sleep. [exhales] -What do we do? -About what? -We have to try to fix this, obviously. -I?m surprised. -Why? What do you mean? -Because you don?t believe marriage. Now you?re writing an article about how great it is. -I?m just saying, they love each other, they?ve seen how stressful all this is. Three weddings in three weeks. I mean, no one?s quite themselves. -True. -Do you really think Michelle and Rod are making their best decisions right now? -Probably not. -So, shouldn?t we help them get to a place where that?s at least a possibility? Instead of pretending that they have everything in hand. -Alright then, what do you propose we do? -I don?t know, exactly. -I mean, you?re the writer. And this is your chance to rewrite the story. -Ok. So, if all of this is happening because Rod and Michelle aren?t at their best due to all these pressures that they?re under. -Mmhm. -Is there some way that we could return them to a time when they were their best selves? Like when they first fell in love. -It?s brilliant. How do we do that? -I have no idea. [laughs] -Right. Okay. -Okay. Give me the evening, I will come up with something, uh, you know, another deadline is exactly what I need. -Right. Well then, I?ll see you. -In the morning. -See you in the morning. - In the morning, great. -Yeah. Goodnight. -Goodnight, goodnight. -Yeah. -Hey, how?re you doing? -Well I just don?t think I can face going back today. -Did you get any sleep? -Not really. I cried so much I think I used up all the Kleenex in the house. I just don?t think I can do today?s events. -Well, did you want me to call around, cancel things? -Not yet, no. -We?ll go, we?ll try on dresses and then I?ll take you for a cocktail before you head home. -T, I think... deep down, that that?s why I wasn?t sure about your article. Bride number two runs away from her wedding a day before the big event. It?s hardly inspiring stuff. -Michelle, there is no one who doesn?t find you inspiring. Trust me. Your biggest fan is sitting right here. -Thank you, T. -Hey, I uh, I forgot my computer in the guest house so I?ll meet you out front in a minute. Ok? -K. [sighs] [clears throat] -Hey, sorry, I wasn't sure exactly what you were talking about... -There's no time. I have to meet Michelle out front for a bridesmaid event. -That?s good, isn?t it? I mean, if she was gonna break things off... -How did you survive those war zones? Anyway, I only have a few seconds so here?s the plan. -Ok. -Ok, I?m gonna take Michelle to the bridal fitting then I?m gonna take her for a drink. She thinks we?re going for just a drink, but we?re actually gonna be going to Di Marco's. That?s where Rod and Michelle first met. He was working in the kitchen, she was a waitress, right? -Hm. -They fell in love there. You?re gonna go get Rod while she?s in the fitting you?re gonna take him, she?s not gonna know he?s there, then I?m gonna bring her in, she?s gonna see Rod, surprise. They?re back in love. -That?s, that?s great. -Great. -Ok. -Awesome. -See you there. -Let's go. -I'm never gonna remember that. [laughing] -That was so much fun! -All our dresses are amazing. -Ok, well I think I?m gonna get this girl some rest but we?ll see you guys tomorrow. -Get some sleep. -Bye. -If you can. -Mmhmm. -Thank you ladies, I will see you both tomorrow. Yes. -I?ve never seen a more excited bride. It?s so romantic. -You really think that this will make any difference? -Trish thinks it?s worth a shot. And isn?t the moment when it's worth trying everything? -Thanks for taking care of me, T, but I think I?m gonna head home. I am wiped. -Are you sure? I was really hoping we could spend a little time together. -Oh. Fine. One drink. -Absolutely. I thought we could go here. -No, I... -One drink. Come on, we haven?t been here in years. -Well... I don't know- -Let's go. -Looks like a slow day. -This is where Rod and I met. He was working in the kitchen and I was waiting tables. We used to close up together almost every night. I think Mr. Di Marco knew that something was going on because he started closing earlier and earlier when he could. Hey, you. -Hey, beautiful. Can we sit? -Yeah. -Thank you for making that happen. -I'm trying to channel what Trish Paterson would have said. -You know, I?m surprised that someone who spends his life wandering the world has turned out to be such a romantic. -I actually find myself romanticizing about going back home. Starting a real life. -Uh no, no way. Not gonna happen. -[engine roaring] -Woohoo! [sighs] -What is it? -It?s just that I?m not certain what my article is even about anymore. It?s less that I have writers block and more that my subject?s changed and I am not exactly sure what's replacing it. -You have to have patience. Every time I go on an assignment I get half way through and realize it?s all changed. -What do you do then? -I wait. Eventually the perfect moment, the perfect image presents itself. I just have to be there, ready to grab it when it does. -The perfect moment. -But you have to wait for it. -Well how will I know when it comes along? -You?ll know. -Trish! -Oh, hey guys. -Looks like you guys worked everything out. -We did. -Good. Here I was afraid I was going to have to return my bridesmaid dress. -Can you? Return it? -Oh, you?re serious? -We decided to call off the wedding. For real this time. Since you guys have helped us so much to reach this decision, we wanted to let you know right after we told our parents. -Um... uh. Wait, so you guys didn?t settle anything? -No, we did. We just didn?t come to the conclusion that you both thought we would. We spent hours, just the two of us, talking about what we really wanted from our lives. -And we kept coming back to the same conclusion. We both love our work too much to give it up right now. -We wanted to thank you both for helping to bring us to this place. And because everything?s already paid for, we?re still having the reception. -Are you joking? -No, not at all. We?re calling it our ?good match, bad timing party? -Ok. -Alright. We?ll see you there. -Yeah. -I?m sure we?ll all need a drink. -Okay, great. Yeah. [sighs] -Not the twist to the story you were expecting. -No. [peaceful music] -Wow. You look stunning. -I wasn?t sure what to wear. What do you wear to celebrate two people not getting married? -No idea. But, you nailed it, Paterson. -No motorcycle, huh? -Don?t think I didn?t consider it. It?s my parents old Caddy. Hope that?s alright. -Of course. [engine rumbling] -How?re you feeling? -How am I feeling? Hm. Like a failure. I don?t know how I went from being so exhausted by all these weddings to feeling really sad that this one isn?t happening. -That?s understandable. -I guess I just don?t believe that that perfect moment you were talking about is actually gonna happen. -It will happen. Trust me. [classical music] -I can?t believe they called it off. What a mess. -[Laurel] Crazy. -[Carrie] Totally crazy. -Isn?t this gonna mess with your whole, you know, wedding story thingy? -Yeah, it sure is. You know what? Excuse me, I think it?s time for cake. -Okay, sure. We?ll see you later. [indiscernible conversations] -Trish! I?ve been looking everywhere for you. Oh. -Ah! -Hi. -How are you doing? -How am I doing? How are you doing? -I?m fine. I am better than fine. I know that Rod and I are making the right decision but we knew it would be harder on everyone else than either him or me. -Well, seems like everyone is enjoying the party, so... -I was talking about you, Trish. I have been thinking about your article. -Oh, Michelle... that's the last thing that you should be thinking about. -No, it?s important to me. You have to write it. People need to know that when something isn?t right in their lives, they can change it. -To be honest, I?m searching now for what it?s even gonna be about. -I get it. It?s your piece, it?s your decision, T. But think about it, please? -Ok. -I gotta go. [sniffling] Laurel, hey. What?s the matter? -Gluten free cupcakes. -What? -Yeah. There are no gluten free cupcakes within a 200 mile radius of our wedding site. -That?s too bad. -My sister is gluten intolerant and now she won't have any cupcakes to eat at the reception. -I suspect it's not the cupcakes you?re really upset about? -No. I just can?t believe Sean left me here to plan our entire wedding because he?s incapable of saying no to anything his boss demands. -You know, I think that you've been really amazing, taking all of this on on your own. -Is this what the future is gonna be like? Me holding down the fort while Sean runs off whenever he wants? -I?m sure this is an exception. -I don?t know. You know, maybe... Maybe Rod and Michelle have the right idea. Maybe this is just a terrible time to get married. -I?m leaving you this message as your best friend. You need to call Laurel as soon as you get this. I love you, but you have left her to deal with this entire wedding by herself and she is at a breaking point, so call her! [sighs] Is it wrong of me to say that I love my friends, but right now they are driving me so crazy that I wouldn?t be sorry if I didn?t see them again until our 25th high school reunion? -Well, I have the perfect solution for you. -What?s that? -[Ryan] You seeing what I?m seeing? -I'm sorry. -It seems like we?re the object of some interest. -Mmhm. Should we give them something to talk about. In the Heat of the night... Watching the... sittin' here thinking -This is what I?ve been missing. -What do you mean? -It?s not me trotting off to some foreign country, it's... I?m missing being with family. Celebrating. I?m missing being with friends. Nothing to do, sit here waiting for you -It?s happening! -Oh yeah. [cell phone chimes] -And that?s why it?s just not working out and why, unfortunately, I don?t think I can finish the feature. -No. -What? -I said the answer is no. I don?t hand out feature articles like Halloween candy, Trish. You?re lucky to get one. So, you?re still writing the piece. -I uh, I... Helen, I can?t. I just can?t. I have no idea what the angle is, there aren?t even three weddings anymore. Some people might not even speak to me again if I do this. I really... -Didn?t you tell me you wanted to write personal stories? Important stories? -Yes. -It?s easy to write 200 words on nail polish, Trish. This, what you said you wanted to do, it?s hard. And the hard part comes when it doesn?t go exactly the way you thought it would and you have to adapt. Like now. You have an assignment, close it out. -But... [call ends] -Ah, back to the motorcycle are we? -Don?t act like you?re not impressed. -You just like that I have to hang onto you. -Hm. -Love what this does to my hair. -Uh-huh. [engine revving] [indiscernible conversations] Hair looks great, by the way. -You?re lying, but that?s sweet. Excuse me, a moment, I need to have a word with your brother. -Gonna find a place to change. Don?t worry, I?ll ask someone. -Hey. Did you get my messages? I also sent you nine texts. -I got them, yes, and I thought they were perfectly calm. -Don?t mock me. You are in the soup. Have you talked to her? -Of course. I called her as soon as I got your messages and I changed my flights and came back right away. -I just don?t understand how you could have left her to take care of all this on her own. -Well I had to work, Trish. And because I did, now we're able to go away for an entire month. -This is why I?m skeptical of all this marriage stuff. -Why? So you?ll never have to deal with pain or problems? -Yes, exactly. -Well, they get you anyway, and when they do there?s only one way through it. -What?s that? -Forgiveness. I told Laurel that I let her down and I apologized and she forgave me. It didn?t happen easily or right away, but she forgave me because that?s who she is. And that?s why I love her. Come on, we have a wedding to celebrate. -Can I sit? -Yeah, sure. -How are you doing? -Alright. It's a trip, this whole crazy wedding season. -Don?t tell me you?re actually trying to work right now. In the middle of a party? -If I don?t write my ideas down I forget them. -Well, I?ve got an idea. Come with me. Put that thing away, let?s go, come on. Come on. Let?s go. Come on. Follow me. -I am intrigued. Where are we going? -You've been running around for the brides and then trying to write in your down time. I know you love the water, but have you even really seen it yet? -You mean this lake right here? -The very one. -Well I?m seeing it now. -Hm. -Hm. Paddle boarding. Ok. -Wow. It?s beautiful, really. [camera shutter clicks] -[laughing] -[camera shutter clicks] -[sighs] Like you said... beautiful. You know, I thought we had the perfect moment on the dock the other night. Till we got interrupted. -Yeah. -You think this moment might be a bit better? -I think this moment might be a lot better. [romantic music] -I just gotta deal with my in-laws. -It?ll be fine. I understand. No way. -June... -Hm? -June. -What? -Look. -What's up? -I uh, just got the word. -The word? Australis? [laughs] -Yeah. -What? -Just... just timing sucks. In order for me to make the flight I?d have to be on the 5:00pm ferry out tomorrow. -Tomorrow as in... -Any time after the ceremony but before the reception. Just say the word and I?ll turn it down. -No! No, no, no, brother. That?s not my decision to make. After all these years of you talking about this trip, I'm not gonna be the reason you give it up. -I didn?t mean for you to make the decision for me. I just... I just wonder if there?s another... way. -You know, maybe it?s best if you do go. Now, rather than later. -What do you mean? -Uh, I mean... You can?t toy with Trish, ok? She?s my best friend and she?s always gonna be a part of my life, so, if you want to be with her, you need to be very sure that?s what you want and tell her exactly how you feel. I love you. That?s my one ask. [emotional music] [emotional music] -Oh hey, I?ve been writing non-stop since you we got back from the beach. I feel like I?ve finally made this breakthrough. Is everything ok? -So, this is one of the hardest things I've had to do in a long time. -What is it? What?s going on? -I?m leaving tomorrow. -What do you mean, leaving? -I got the call about the southern lights trip. -So you?re gonna miss your own brother?s wedding? -I?ll be there for the ceremony but not the reception. -And Sean?s okay with that? -I mean, he?s not crazy about it but he knows it's been a long-time dream of mine and it?s obviously an opportunity I can?t pass up. -You?ve gotta do it. -Really? I wasn?t expecting the timing of this to be so bad. -Yeah, but you know, it?s the one thing that you've always wanted to photograph. You have no choice. You?ve gotta grab that opportunity. -Hm. Would it be ok with you if we tried things again when I get back? -No. -No? -No, Ryan. I?m sorry. You know, everything that?s gone on these last few weeks with these weddings, it?s... changed me. I don?t really know how to explain it except that all the things that I used to think were ridiculous and sentimental, they all seem incredibly meaningful now. And I just, I guess I just don?t want to live a life where I?m sad every few months cause it?s time for you to leave again. I don?t want to resent you for that. -I understand. -And, you know, look at it this way. We?re both getting what we said we wanted. You?re gonna photograph that one thing you always wanted to shoot and I can finally call myself a writer. So, we should be happy. -Yeah. Yeah, we should. -Well, I should... I should finish this up. Just, um... [melancholy music] [cheerful music] [exhales] As I look back on these three weeks of celebration, the lesson I take with me is that every couple and every wedding is as unique as the love story that spawned it. And you have to trust that eventually all heartbreak will lead to joy. [emotional music] [cheerful music] -You look beautiful. -Thank you. -Dear friends and family, we welcome you in celebrating the marriage of Sean and Laurel. [cheering and applause] [indistinct conversations] -Trish! Look! George proposed! Another wedding! [laughing] -Wow. Carrie, that?s wonderful. Congratulations, you guys. -Guess we caught the fever. -It really is the season. Wait, where?s your guy? Where?s Ryan? -He had to leave. -He left his own brother?s wedding reception? -Well, he had no choice. He was offered his dream job so he had to go. -I don?t care if it was his dream job or not. That must have hurt. -Well, I mean, these things happen, you know. He's been waiting for years for the opportunity to photograph... What are you... You?re gonna miss your flight. -No, I?m not missing anything. Everything I?m missing is right here. -[Announcer] Excuse me, Ryan Peterson to the podium. Ryan Peterson to the podium. -They?re calling for you. At the front, Ryan. -Oh, yeah. [laughs] -Words are not really my strength, so that?s why I thought I?d tell Laurel and Sean?s story through pictures. Sean only reached the highest of his full potential after he met his other half. Now, I do have to say one thing, even though I am the big brother, I uh, I have to admit that Sean understood something long before I did. He understood that peak experiences are best when shared with someone you love. Someone who reminds you to play to your strengths and makes you the best possible version of yourself. And the kind of home that you'd be excited to come back to, or better yet, never leave in the first place. So... to Laurel and Sean. Cheers. [cheering and applause] And now, to Sean?s best friend and a very special member of our family is gonna say a few words. [applause] -You're a tough act to follow. -You have nothing to worry about. You got this, ok? -So, as many of you know, I have been writing my first magazine article about this crazy wedding season we?ve all been living through. And it?s given me a chance to reflect on what I?ve learned from each of these couples that I?ve been lucky to see up close. So, here it goes. First thing I?ve learned is that you have to cherish what?s unique about your partner. It?s those, those little rituals that only the two of you share. You know, we all go through this life feeling the same way, awkward, maybe even a little misshapen. Sort of the way that jigsaw puzzle pieces are and like a jigsaw puzzle piece, when you meet that person who fits perfectly with you, you make a truly beautiful picture together. Like Peter and June. -We cherish you, Trish! [laughter] -Now, the second lesson is that you must truly know yourself in life before you can ever hope to make another person happy. So, if marriage is a union of two people, it has to be a union who feel complete within themselves. And if you don?t have that, then you need to find the courage to call a halt to things. No matter how hard that may be. But Sean and Laurel taught me the most important lesson of all. Forgiveness. If we?re gonna make our way through this life with the person we love, we must forgive. Each and every one of us is flawed, right? And though we may hurt one another, sometimes even deeply, we all deserve a chance to earn back trust and respect. We all deserve a chance at love. We do. I learned those lessons from the couples here tonight. And it's due to each of them that I feel ready, maybe, for the first time to take a risk and be in love. So, thank you. Now, everyone please raise a glass to Sean and Laurel and their love story. To Sean and Laurel, Peter and June, Michelle and Rod. Congratulations, guys. I love you. [cheers and applause] I'm in for the long run Don't ever want to be done I'm all in, all in ...just want to have fun and I'm coming undone I'm falling, falling... For you -Looks like my brother chose to chase a different dream this time. -Yeah, not sure how I?m gonna compete with a bunch of mystical lights to be honest. [laughs] -Come on, Trish. You?ve always shone brighter than you thought. ...and take me for a ride I'm right behind you -Thank you for taking a chance and staying. -Well, you were the one that made me realize that I'd be an idiot if I left, so... -And you made me realize what I didn?t even know I was missing. ... I'll follow blindly And take me for a ride I'm right behind you If you ever want to stay then I'll be with you [laughing] [cell phone chimes] -You guys, I heard back! Our story is gonna be the lead feature for August. I?m gonna be a published writer thanks to you. [cheering] -Trish! I?ve got something else for you! [cheers and applause]
