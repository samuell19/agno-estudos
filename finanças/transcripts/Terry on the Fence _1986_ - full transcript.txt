(Church bells ring) (He whistles tune) (Rings doorbell) - Morning. - Morning. - Oh, there's this package. - Thanks. Is it for me? The parcel, is it for me? Don't be silly. Why should it be? - Don't snatch! - Let me see, Tracey! - Shan't! - (Man) Come here, you two! If you must know, it's for Mum. - What was all that about? - She won't let me see. Guess what, Mum? It's for you. Here, Terry. You open it for me. I was gonna give you it on your birthday, but you might as well have it now. Oh, Mum, it's great! - Mail order. Not bad, eh? - A bit flash, I'd say. Mum, can I try it on? Please. You don't want to be late for school. Oh, all right, but don't get it dirty. You've got to save it for Saturday for your party. You want your gran to see you looking nice. Right, Mum. - Right, I'd better be off. - I'll just finish these, love. Don't forget, ladies' semi-finals tonight. Your mother throws a mean dart. And, Tracey, give a hand when your mum gets back from work. - We want to get away sharpish. - OK, Dad. Tracey! You and Terry, no arguments, right? No, Dad. - Show-off! - Oh, you! Now take it off. You heard what Mum said. Clear off and mind your own business! Here... Can we get away early for once? I will try. - Mum, you know what Terry did? - Not now, dear. Ta. Bye, love. Bye, Terry! Bye, Dad! (Engine starts) (Car drives off) Bye, Mum! His dinner money. See if you can catch him! Oh, Terry, you do look nice. Present, is it? Sort of, Mrs Parsons. I have to go now. I'll be late. Terry! You forgot your money! (Sighs) (Whistle blows) (Children shouting) (Chatter) All right now! Settle down there. Right, compositions. You know, I couldn't sleep after reading your ghost stories. Michelle, there's only one G in "jugular". (Makes choking sound) Right, you've all got some corrections to do. - Terry Harmer, is he off sick? - I don't know, sir. - Sorry, sir. - Get that shirt! - Wow! - Look at our Tel! - (Whistles) - Oh, look at him! That must be some funeral you're going to, Terry. (Laughter) It wasn't fair. I mean, he makes me sick. All I done was muck about with... Watch out! (Rings bell) I saw your Terry this morning. He did look nice. He had... I'm sorry, I can't stop. I'm in a bit of a rush. (Sighs) I got some tinned salmon. Terry likes that. It was the quickest thing I could think of. Here, let me do that. - Have you made your bed? - Oh, sorry, I forgot. Terry, you're wearing that new shirt! Ssh! Mum, Terry's got that black shirt on, the one you're trying to keep clean for Saturday. It's all right, Mum. It's not dirty or anything. You stupid boy! What do you mean, not dirty? Perhaps not to you, it isn't. Sorry, Mum. Go and tidy your room and pick up everything off the floor! I'm getting tea ready. You know Dad and I are going out tonight. Oh, Mum, can I keep it on till teatime, my shirt? If you like. Selfish little pig! Mum, don't let him. Make him take it off! Shut your mouth, Tracey. You keep out of it! Open the door! Let me in! (Mum) Stop it, both of you! Tracey, Terry! I'm worn out enough as it is. Terry, come away from that door! It's all her fault. She won't leave me alone. Tracey, open this door. I want a word with you. Tell him, Mum. He thinks he can get away with anything just cos he's a boy! Tracey, how many times do I have to tell you not to make trouble? - You're not his mother. I am. - That's right. And you... If you can't get along with each other, then keep out of each other's way, for heaven's sake! - You get away with murder. - I do not! - Spoilt little baby! - No, I'm not! Yes, you are. Mummy's little baby. Change his nappy then! - Shut up! - Stop it! - You're a little baby! - No, I'm bloody not! How dare you! You're not getting away with this, Terry Harmer! This time, you've gone too far, Terry. While you're living in my house, you'll do as I say. You'll act and speak decently. Now, is that clear? Is it? Terry? I'm clearing off. No one wants me in this house. All you do is shout at me and treat me like a baby! So I'm going... for good! (Whistles tune) Well, tonight's the night. Your chance to get in the final. One hundred and eighty! Huh? Marge, what's up, love? I'm just fed up. That's all. What is it? Work? Has someone upset you at work again? It's not that, Jack. It's the children. Well, it's Terry, really. He's just being so awkward. That's all. That's all? Look at the state you're in. Look at the kitchen. We're supposed to be going out enjoying ourselves. Now you can't say, "That's all." Where is he? Come on, love. Come and sit down. Tell me all about it. (Distant thunder rumbles) It was all such a rush and I shouldn't have lost my temper. Don't worry about it, love. He'll come back as soon as he's hungry. Boys usually do. I'll go and sort Tracey out. She's old enough to know better. There's no need for you to feel guilty. You work damn hard for those kids. Yes, I suppose so. I can't help worrying. I know. Anything nice for tea? I got some tinned salmon. It's Terry's favourite. (Dog barks) (Crack of thunder) (Thunder cracks loudly) (Crack of thunder) - Where are you going, Pig Face? - Nut him, Les! - Put your boot in. - Yeah, gob on him! Shut your mouths! Sit down. - Yes, sit down! - All of you! - He ain't from our school. - Nah. Which school do you go to then? Eh? - Foxhill. - Eugh, Foxhill poof! - It's near where I live. - Up in them snobby houses? - Palmerston Road. - Got a garage, has it? No, there's an old asbestos one at the back. - Oh, asbestos at the back! - Belt up! What you doing down here, nosing around? Nicked something? Come back for it? No, I haven't. Honest! Liar! What did you come down here for then? I was gonna sleep here. I've gone off from home. You don't fool me! You're up to something, stinking little liar! - It's true, I tell you! - Get stuffed! - We don't blinking believe ya! - Lying little wally! That's why we're gonna kick your teeth in! That's right. Get him! Put your boot in, Les! Get him! I want that Pig Face dead or alive! - Get him! - Yeah, clobber him! - Boot him! - Get after him, you wallies! Get him! - Cut him off then. Round here! - Come on! Get him up! What are you gonna do with him, Les? You'll see. (Radio) 'Periods of sunshine over most of the country...' Mum, shall I clear the table? (Weather forecast continues on radio) (Turns volume up) 'An electrical storm approaching 'from the south-west. Heavy rain is expected...' (Switches radio off) You realise Terry's out in this? He shouldn't have been allowed to go out in the first place, especially with this storm brewing. (Sighs) I want him home. Oh, I can't sit around here, waiting. Dad! Let me come with you, please. I know some of the places where Terry hides out. Anyway, Mum ought to be here in case he does... I mean, when he does come home. All right, Tracey, come on. I'll get the car started. - I'm sorry, Mum. - Yes, I know. Right, where to? Out by the Court flats. That old building site. He knows he shouldn't go there, but... (Thunder rumbles) He does know not to stand underneath trees? Dad, he's not stupid. - Where are we going, Les? - You can't take him home. - Your mum'll murder ya! - He ain't going home. I better get some fags. Listen, leave it, in case my old man comes for his paper. Oi! Where do you think you're going? Uh, it's my son. He's not come home. We thought he might be hiding up here. He'd better not be. Kids, they're a menace! You shouldn't encourage him. - No, you're quite right. - OK, carry on. Well, if he is in there, you tell him. Do you hear? You tell him! (Inaudible conversation) Where are you taking us, mate? Your mum gonna give us a party, is she? Terry! Terry! (Glass smashes) (Cat miaows) - Where next? - We could try the Common. (Tracey) Terry, where are you? Terry! It's hopeless. I can't think of anywhere else he might be. There is one place he might have gone. Your gran's. It's worth a try. (Les) In there, all of you! How long have you had this place, Les? Oh, look at that! Leave it, you lot. Leave it! Now just you listen, Pig Face. I'm gonna ask you some questions and I want the truth, right? You reckon you go to Foxhill, do ya? - Yeah, I do. - What's the headmaster's name? - Mr Marshall. - Mr Marshall? "Please, Mr Marshall, can I go to the lavvy?" "Can I lick your boots, Mr Marshall?" All right, belt up! What stuff have you got at your school and where is it? I don't know. What stuff do you mean? Come off it. You know what I mean. Stuff worth nickin'. Tellies, videos, that sort of thing. Well, there are a few things. I think there's a telly and a radio. Don't get clever with me. Either there is a telly or there ain't. You've got ten seconds to tell us, so don't muck around! Listen, Pig Face, I've had it done to me and I ain't scared of doing it to no one else! - His mum done that. Didn't she? - Shut up! Are you gonna tell me or have I gotta... There's a big telly on the stand and a video. And there's five or six radios and a record player. - Is that all? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Blimey, that's enough, innit? - Got none of that down Napier. - Only cos you nicked it. Right, where's all this stuff kept? Well, the radios are in Mr Marshall's office and the telly and the video are in the library, locked up. - What's your name, Pig Face? - Terry Harmer. Right, Harmer, I'll tell you what the score is and you lot listen as well cos I ain't a bleeding record player. We're gonna do Foxhill School tonight. Sonny here takes us and he shows us the layout, then we do it, right? - Yeah, great. - Good idea, Les. Yeah. We'll lay the stuff up somewhere till tomorrow, then I'll fix it up with a bloke I know to unload it. Right? If you're wondering about him, he comes with us. All the way. I can't! I can't! You bloody can and if you open your gob, I'll chib you like this! I ain't gonna do that! I ain't gonna! I ain't gonna! I ain't! No? Now, you come with us and you do as I say or you stay there, Pig Face, until you rot! I ain't talking about missing your breakfast or tomorrow's tea. I'm talking about for good! You can shout your rotten lungs out in here. No one'll hear ya. No one'll come! Come on, you lot. Wait, wait! Are you comin' then? (Rings doorbell) Oh! Oh, it's you, Jack. What a surprise! Tracey, too. Oh, fancy! Well, you haven't come out just for the ride, have you? No, Mum, we're looking for Terry. - What? Eh? - We're looking for Terry! Terry? Why? Isn't he at home? We wouldn't be looking for him if he was. Where is he then? We thought he might be with you, Gran. We wanted to give him a lift home. - (Thunder rumbles) - He shouldn't be out in this. I expect he'll take cover somewhere. Tracey, come on. - What? - Mum, we have to go. He'll come back for tea. If it's something nice. (Car door closes) (Engine starts) My gran lives here and I'm going in. Listen, Pig Face, if you want it now, you can have it. Once and for all, get it into your nut, there ain't no out for you, so stop poncing about! It's over there. Now, listen, I want the best way into this stinking school. I don't want to be led right up to the caretaker's door neither, so let's have it straight. There's two ways in. The back way's the best. We have to go down that alley. Right, round the back it is then, but I'm warning you. One little trick and you're getting it. - Yeah. - Yeah! Belt up and come on! Let's go. Where are we going? Round the stinking block? Shut up, will you? The kid's gonna tell us. Cloth ears! It's over that gate, then across the yard. Then we can get in through a window. What about the caretaker? He'll be in his house now, I expect. You hope, you mean! You'll be the only one he'll recognise. - No way he could pick us out. - Except for Denis. You can't tell him from all the others, can you? Ha-ha(!) Shut up, will you? Let's just get this job done! Ethel, I'm just gonna do my rounds! Don't be long. Your supper's nearly ready. Keep it hot. I'll be back in a minute. Right, Pig Face, you're first. Now, listen. Don't think there's any way out now cos there ain't. You're the kid who comes here. You've shown us the way. You're in it right up to your neck, so it's down to you to get us in and out safe with the gear. Come on, hurry up. Let's get inside, for God's sake! Come on, Les. I feel like I've got my trousers down out here! Shut your traps! I'm just making sure Pig Face knows the score. Now get in! And remember what I told ya. They're locked! They're always locked. We have to go up there. Come on, stupid. Right, what's-your-name, which way to the headmaster's room? - Huh? - You, Pig Face. - Tony. - Terry! Terry, if it ain't too long since I asked, which way to the radios and that? Through those doors and down the other stairs. Right, you lot, keep close together and follow me. No biting my bum. I don't want the plague! - Get stuffed! - (Laughter) Down there! (Les) Well, which one is it? Oi, you! Oh, that one at the end. Through the office to Mr Marshall's room. - Cobblers! - What do you expect? It ain't like nicking something off a barrow. Get stuffed and shut up! I'm just thinking. That's funny. - It ain't moving, is it? - No. Admit it. You ain't got the first idea how to open the door. - You need a bit of wire. - Have you got a bit of wire? - No. - Well, then... It's shoulders to the door, innit? - Get away! - You're joking? - No. - Let's see you then. Yeah, come on then. - Get in, all of you, quick. - Nice one, Les! Terry, they're definitely through here, ain't they? Cos if they ain't, we're all trapped in here for nothing. Yeah, we have to come in here for 'em, before radio lessons. - Let's get in and get 'em. - Smash it in, Les. - Paralyse it, man. - Oh, don't do that. - What do you mean? - It's not locked. - Just push it. - Oh, cheers. Ta very much. Makes things easier, don't it? All right, you lot! - We ain't here for that! - No need to hit me! You'll give me a bad name, being destructive. Shut it! Right, Tel, which cupboard for the radios? That top one there. Easy. Dead easy. (Distant voices) (Indistinct chatter) Smart. These'll fetch a few quid. - Not bad, not bad. - Clever old Les. You ain't just an ugly face, you know! This one's yours, for insurance, so you're right in it with us, see? Bring it down the ravine tomorrow, half past four. Don't bring no one with you cos they won't find nothing. They'll think you're telling them a load of rubbish. OK. Hold it. There's someone coming! Out! - We're getting out? - Open the bleedin' windows! - Quick, let's get out of here! - Oi, you, give us a hand! - Let me in, you hooligans! - It's stuck. Try the other one. - Come on, open this door! - We've got to get out. Come on, you lot! Let me in, you hooligans. Come on, open the door! Do you hear what I'm saying? Open the door! Come along now, open the door! Do you hear me? Open this door! Oh! You... Stop, you boys! Come back! Come on, don't hang about! That bloke's coming! Quick, grab hold, Tel. Give us your hand! Come back! Wait, wait, you scumbags! Don't forget. Tomorrow, half past four. And remember, on your own. If you open your gob... - I'll be waiting for you. - Yeah. OK. Still no sign of him. I'm giving it till eight o'clock, then I'm calling the police. (Phone rings) Hello, Terry? Is that you? Where have you been...? Oh, it's you, Mum. (It's your mother.) What's that? No, not yet. Yes, I'm sure you are. So are we. Look, Mum, we have to use the phone. Yes, of course we will. Right away. Yes, as soon as we know. (She sighs) Good God, boy! Where the hell have you been? Look at the state of you! Look at your lovely new shirt! Where have you been, you bad boy? I'm sorry, Mum. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Terry, you've upset your mother. You've had us all worried sick. Where on earth have you been? I met some boys on the Common. We went back to their place. We had a sort of game. And I forgot... I forgot the time. Well, don't you ever do it again! - Dad, please! - All right. We'll talk about it later. But first, it's a hot bath before you catch pneumonia. - Tracey, go and run the water. - OK, Dad. Dad, I... I'm sorry. Come on, son. Now where's the line of symmetry on this, or isn't there one? Terry? - Terry Harmer? - Sir? Not with us this morning, are you? Yes, sir. No, sir. All right. Anyone else? - Sir! - Sheila. Through the middle, horizontally. (Teacher) That's right. Now, what about this one? - Please, sir! - Sir! Terry Harmer! Now come along, pay attention. Yes, sir. Mr Peters, I know it's nothing new to you, children breaking into a school and making off with a couple of radios, but it's got to be nipped in the bud before it gets a hold. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Of course. This has all the hallmarks of what you'd call an inside job. They knew which room to enter and which cupboard to break into. Yes, I think you've got a point there, sir. Might be worth calling in CID to take a few fingerprints, but you realise, of course, we can only fingerprint suspects. And then only with the parents' permission. Yes, I see. But at least you could show your face in the classroom and say something to put the wind up the little blighters. Yes, I'll do that, sir, if you think it'll help. Thank you, Mr Peters. Then we may as well begin with the Fourth Year. Right, now who hasn't got their dinner tickets? - Me, sir! - Me, sir! - May I, Mr Evans? - Yes, of course, Headmaster. Today is a sad day for Foxhill School. For I have to tell you that last night a group of boys entered the school. Yes, broke into our school and made off with two radio receivers. Had it not been for the vigilance of Mr Jarvis, they would have taken all five of them and goodness knows what else besides. Now this incident has damaged the good name of Foxhill, so I want you to pay careful attention to Mr Peters. - Thank you, Mr Peters. - Thank you, Mr Marshall. As your headmaster says, two radios have been stolen from the school. Among the evidence, we have the description of one boy who may be able to help us with our inquiries. So listen very carefully because this may be someone you know. Four or five boys were seen running from the scene of the crime by the caretaker, Mr Walter Jarvis. And one of the boys, quite a small lad, was seen to be wearing blue jeans and a black or grey shirt. I am convinced that someone in this school knows something about this. And I promise to find out who it is. Meanwhile, unless those radios are returned, I shall have to seriously consider cancelling the summer term visit to Boulogne by hovercraft. (All) Oh, sir! I'd like a word with you, Headmaster, if I may. Own up, Harmer! Go on, Terry Harmer! We know it's you. Where's your black shirt today, then? Look at his face - he's red as a beetroot! (Shouting and jeering) (Chant) Own up! Own up! Own up! - (Knock at door) - Come! The boy Terry Harmer. I believe you have something to tell me. Sir... Please, sir... About the radios. It wasn't my fault. They made me do it! Go on, boy. Well, there was a row at home last night, and I ran off. Up to the Common, the old bandstand. And I got caught by these big boys. And they made me tell them what stuff we've got at school. And they forced me to help them get in. And they made me take one of the radios. - Made you take it? - Yes, sir. So I'd be part of it, so I wouldn't tell on them. And what have you done with this radio you were made to keep? I hid it in our garage. In a bag of compost. But it's all right, sir. I see. And what were you going to do with this radio? Keep it? No, sir. I had to take it back to this big boy, after school. - And if you don't? - He's going to cut me up! Oh, is he? Now tell me, where do these boys come from? Did they give you their names or their school? And what did they look like? The police are going to want to know all these things. You don't know? Or you're not prepared to say? One more thing. The caretaker tells me that one of these boys helped you over the gate to enable you to get away. Now why would he do a thing like that for someone he's bullying? Please, sir. I think he was scared that if I got caught he would get found out himself. What did you say his name was? Well, Terry Harmer, I may regret saying this later, but I am inclined to believe you. So for the moment we'll suspend judgement. Now off you go and retrieve that radio from...your garage. - And hurry back here. - Yes, sir. Right. Dismissed! 'Yes, Mr Marshall?' Be so kind as to ring the caretaker, will you? I'd like to see him again, please. Before Terry Harmer gets back. And tell him it's urgent, will you? Oh, you off school then, Terry? Um...I just forgot something. Excuse me. - (Knock at door) - Come! Ah, Mr Jarvis. Just a little point I'd like to clear up. About those two boys, the ones you may recall. Yes, sir? You said you got close enough to see one of them, the boy in the black shirt, fairly clearly. That's right, Mr Marshall. I chased across the playground and I'd have caught him if his mate hadn't pulled him over. - His mate? - They were mates, all right. Thick as thieves they were. - You're certain of that? - Positive. The big one was shouting and holding out his hand for the other kid to catch it. Can you remember what he said? His exact words? Oh, yes. Ah... "Grab hold. Grab hold, Tel." "Tel"? Tel. That's a nickname for Terry, isn't it? Yes, they must have been staying behind to help each other. Thank you, Mr Jarvis. You've been most helpful, most helpful. Perhaps you'll tell Mrs Baker that I'll see Terry Harmer - the moment he gets back. - Yes, sir. When you've been to the bank, could you collect those files from the stationers? Certainly. Excuse me. You can go straight in. Mr Marshall's waiting for you. (Music plays) You can thank your lucky stars that you won't have to pay to get this repaired. Now, what about the other one? The one your "friend" got away with. How do you intend getting that back? Sir, I don't know where it is. And he's not my friend, I told you! You told me a lot of things, Harmer, and I made the mistake of believing you. You must think me a complete fool to believe that story about this boy threatening to cut you up. But, sir, he showed me where someone had done it to him! And he said he would do it to me. He did, he did! - He made me do it! - Don't shout at me, boy! I happen to know that this boy IS a friend of yours. Bullies don't go around calling their victims pet names, laddie! - Pig Face! - What did you say?! He called me Pig Face most of the time. But once or twice he did say my name. And when I was getting over the gate, he called me Tel. - I don't know why. - Now just listen to me. If you really want to convince me that you don't know who this boy is, then you tell me his name. Either I get that radio back or you give me the boy's name. It's up to you. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - Now get out. I've wasted enough time on this already. (Lesson going on) - Yes, boy? - I was looking for someone. A mate of mine. He comes in here sometimes. - Who was that then? - A boy called Les. I think his dad gets the papers here. Second on the right, Victoria Gardens... Number 24. - He's got a sort of... - That's right. Oh, thanks. What the hell are you doing here? - I said the stinkin' ravine! - Let go! You're hurting! Get in here so I can bloody kill ya! Go on, get in! Wait 'ere. And watch your filthy paws. Just going upstairs to check she ain't coming. We ain't got long. (Heavy footsteps upstairs) Well? Where is it? The radio - where have you hidden it? They've got it. The caretaker recognised me. - They made me fetch it back. - Yeah? The police were there an' all. They wanted to know who you are, where you live. You didn't say nothin', did you? No, of course not. They didn't believe me. They said that if you called me by a friendly name like Tel, - we must've been friends. - Oh, did they? They didn't think it sounded right for an enemy. Well, we ain't no more, are we? We done a good job together. You was more help than the stinkin' rest of them! Anyway, what are they moanin' about? They got one radio back. - They can't blame you for mine. - But they do, they do! They reckon I'm right in it. They said I've got to get the other radio back or I've got to tell them who you are. What can they do? They can't torture you, can they? Look, if it's me going to Juvenile Court on my own, or you and the rest of them coming too, then you're all of you coming! All of you! But you've forgotten one little thing, sunshine - the radio. I sold it this morning. Got rid of it quick to this bloke before he went to work. - But couldn't you get it back? - Ssh! Quick! It's my mum back from bingo! She won't be here long. She's down the Denmark Bar, five on a Friday. - It's more comfy like that. - Yeah. Leslie? Leslie! Come down here, you little swine! If I've gotta come up there, I'll murder you! - What? What's up? - I'll give you what's up! Come down here and have a look at this carpet! Little swine! You've no right being in this house at all! Look at my carpet! Look at it! You know I like this room kept nice and what do you do with it? You bring in all the muck off the street, you filthy pig! - Ah! - Get out of my sight! Get out! Get out! Go on, get out! (Sniffling) She don't mean nothing. Her temper's her own worst enemy. Sorry, Les. Yeah. - Les? Les? - Yeah, what? Isn't there some way you could get it back? The radio. I don't see how. Ron's got a customer by now. He promised it to someone up at the factory. Les, please. There's only one way. We have to go round to Ron's house - before he gets home from work. - Yeah? Then we get in his shed where he keeps his stuff, and nick it. Eh? What do you mean? It's the only way, innit, Tel? He's not gonna give it us back. You reckon you've got to have it back, so there's only one way. We've got to nick it. All you have to do is keep watch while I get over the garden and get in his shed. You won't even be in it. They can't nick no one for standing on the pavement. And if it ends up with you being the hero over the radio, and keeping me out of Borstal, it's worth a bit of risk, innit? Well, I suppose so. OK. Right. Let's go and suss the place out then, Tel, and I'll give you the lowdown on where to stand. OK? (Doorbell rings) Oh, it's Mr Marshall, isn't it, from the school? - That's right. - Would you like to come in? Thank you. I won't stay long. I'll put your mind at rest. Terry hasn't had an accident or anything. Please sit down. Thank you, Mrs Harmer. Tell me, is Terry at home? No. He usually is by now. I expect he's at some boy's house or other. Yes, he may well be. Why? There's not something wrong, is there? Well, yes, I'm afraid there is. Did he tell you anything about last night, Mrs Harmer? Where he was, what he was doing? Why? Was he doing something he shouldn't? Well, it appears out of character, but I have evidence - a confession, in fact - to prove that Terry was involved in a break-in at the school last night. I'm sorry. I can't believe that. I know Terry. He wouldn't do a thing like that. That's it over there. Now we're gonna have a sort of game with this ball, right? Throwin' it to one another. When we get outside Ron's house, throw it too high and over it goes, right? Mrs Harmer, what makes it so difficult to believe your son is his insistence that these boys were complete strangers when there's no doubt that one of them, the leader, knows Terry very well. How? How do you know? Simply by the name that he called him. The gang leader pulled Terry over the gate to safety and he used his nickname. He called him Tel. But that doesn't mean anything. Well, it does indicate a certain degree of friendship. - I don't agree. - Tracey! Hasn't anyone ever called you "mate" or "friend"? Lots of people call me Trace who don't know me from the Queen. Same with Terry. It's downright unfair to blame him for that. Tracey, you've gone too far. That's enough now. I think I'd better leave now, but before I go I must tell you that Terry ran off from school this morning. And if he's not here at home, then he must be on the loose again. 'Ere, see if you can catch this one. Oh, dear. Ain't I silly? I knew it. I knew there was something up last night. If only he'd trusted us, confided in us. Damn it! - Mum, shall I get Dad's tea? - There's no time for that now. We have to get out and find him. Come on. Oh... I'm sorry, Jack. I can't stand it any more. I'm going to walk across the Common down to the ravine, see if I can't see any sign of him. At least I'll feel as if I'm doing something. All right, all right. You go. I'll see you on the other side. - What's up? - It's the bloke! He's back! Ron?! Quick, he's coming! Shut the door, for God's sake! Stay put. We'll have to lie low until he's gone. Terry? Terry? - Terry? - 'Terry?' - 'Oh, Terry!' - 'Being a good boy, Terry?' 'Where you been, Pig Face?' Have you seen him? Seen who, lady? My Terry. Terry Harmer. Nah. - Are you sure? - We ain't seen nobody, 'ave we? 'Ave we? - No. - Course we ain't. Nah. - What's the trouble? - It's my son, Terry. He's gone missing. I think he may be round here somewhere. He's probably off with some of his mates. - What does he look like? - He's got brown hair, he's wearing a red sweater. He's just 11. OK. We'll keep an eye open for him. If he doesn't show up within an hour, ring us at the station. - (Engine starts) - Thank you. (Engine starts) Quick, he's gone. Let's go. I'll give you a bunk up. - Terry, is it? - Er...yes. Live here, do you? No. But you have the owner's permission to climb over his fence? No. And that radio - yours, is it? It's our school one. I'm just getting it back. Well, you'd better give it to me before you drop it. Anyone else with you over there? I asked you a question, son. Are you by yourself or aren't you? I'm on my own. I see. On your own. You're just looking at the plants, are you? Come on! Tell him to come out. The game's up. - Terence Harmer. - Terence Harmer. Right. Wait over there, please. Leslie John Hicks. Leslie John Hicks! Blimey, I hope he comes. We don't want the case put back after all this. Can they do that? Terry's been through so much already. They're jointly charged. They won't do one without the other. - Are you Leslie Hicks? - Yes, he is. Right. Wait there, please. Terence Harmer. Leslie Hicks. This way, please. Yes, and parents too. Come along. You two boys sit in the front there. Parents, sit behind, please. All stand. Case number seven on your list, sir. Leslie John Hicks and Terence Harmer. - Leslie Hicks? - Yeah. - You're 15? - Yeah. - And Terence Harmer. - Yes, sir. - You're 11? - Yes, sir. Now the charge being brought against you is that you entered Foxhill School, as trespassers, on September 27th, and that you stole two radios. Now, first of all, do you understand the charges being brought against you? Leslie, do you want to say that you did it or that you didn't? Yeah, I did it. Thank you. And Terence, do you want to tell the court that you did or didn't do it? Well? - Yes, sir, but you don't... - No, just a minute. You say yes? And did you know that it was wrong to do that? Yes. We can go into the reasons why in a moment. The facts of the case are as set out in the charge before you. And the property was recovered. You have the relevant reports. Well, we've read the reports about you, which includes your own version of what happened, and the reports from your schools and the social worker. Now, Leslie, you admitted the charge. And you've been before this court before, more than once. Now we still want to help you, Leslie, but the reports lead us to suppose that a period away from home would be the best thing for you. Because of the seriousness of the offence, and your home circumstances, we're thinking of making a care order, but before we do that we must give you the opportunity to be legally represented. Would you like to see the duty solicitor? - No, there's no point. - Very well, then. (Whispering) Committed to the care of the London Borough of Greenwich. (She sighs) Now, Terence. - Or Terry is it? - Yes, sir. Well then, Terry, the report tells us that you have a good and loving home background, that you attend school regularly and your headmaster thinks highly of you. And you say, don't you, that you were an unwilling party, that you were forced into it by...by this boy and three others? - I beg your pardon? - Yes, sir. Hmm. Now my colleagues and I are inclined to accept your story. However, there is one aspect of the matter we'd be grateful if you'd clear up for us if you would. We can understand why you felt impelled to retrieve the stolen radio, but can you tell us why, when you were caught on the fence, you lied to the policeman about the other boy's presence? We cannot understand why you should try to conceal him if he'd been such an enemy to you. Was it because you were still afraid of him? That was it, wasn't it? You were scared. Oh, come now, Terry. That's the only explanation, isn't it? (Whispering) You were sorry for him, weren't you? It says in the report that you were on the fence looking down into the garden. And something that the other boy was doing made you decide not to give him away. Now he wasn't pointing a gun at you, or a knife? He wasn't shaking his fist? Then what was he doing, Terry? He was... He was standing up against the fence. Scratching his bad neck. Until... it started to bleed and... Please, Miss. He was just looking at me. Asking me not to tell. Trying to smile. (Whispering) Thank you, Terry. The court is grateful to you. Absolute discharge. Off you go. - Les... - What? - Cheerio, Les. - See you, Pig Face.
