(classical instrumental music) (birds chirping) - [Adina] You know, we were chilling and I didn't know. - [Man] So what, you should have came to me now, now we all got a problem. - But I didn't even know! But how was I supposed to know she was your girl? - What, listen. (relaxing music) (melodic instrumental music) (train rumbling) - So here it is! It's private as listed which means that why you pay more. So do you go to school or do you just work? Well, my birthday's Friday so I'm going to be having people over for drinks and cake. Feel free to stop by, there's going to be a lot of homosexuals so it might not be your thing. (floorboards creaking) (speaking Spanish) (train rattling and accelerating) When we got to talking, you know, I was like, "So where you from?" and he was like, "Oh, I'm from Connecticut." and I was like, (inhales) "Me too!" You know, I'm from Connecticut. And so then I was like, "Okay so what are you going to school for?" and he was like, "Oh actually, I'm an architect turn actor." and I was like, "Oh I'm an actor turn architect." Mondi, I'm talking. (train rumbling distantly) (paper crinkling) (footsteps) (relaxing ambient music) (inhales) (scoffs) - [Woman] So how much do you think. TMZ's gonna give me for this? I think videos worth more, right? Aw, don't be shy. (groans) (laughs) Come on! Come on, Sunshine! Oh, you look great. Don't cover your face. - I really, really, really hated the whole college thing. So I went to this place called Ashley Oregon and I changed my name and I got a job at a thrift store. And I hung out in the mountains and it was awesome. Then you know, a little, (sighs) well, more like a big problem. Came back and I just couldn't kick it. I was really, I was scared, I was really, really scared. (laughs) I mean, some days we were fine but some days just, weren't at all. But I'm here and that's all that matters. You know, the last time we were together, I really, you know, I thought that was the last time I'd see you. It was such a weird night. (both laughs) But honestly, I couldn't imagine seeing that same person again. But it, it's almost like you're not the same person, I mean, you are but you aren't. - I know things have been messed up lately. I can admit when I make a mistake but you're still my wife and I still love you. I'm willing to fight for this marriage, whatever it takes to keep us together. I hope you want the same. I miss you. (calming classical music) (melodic guitar music) (footsteps) (doorbell) (ambient chatter) (speaking Spanish) - Excuse me? - No habla espanol? - Si. (speaking Spanish) - Gracias. - Hilary. - Adina. Hilary, that's a very pretty name. - Thank you. So what are you like Gatsby not mingling? - I just don't wanna get into the way of things, you know? - Hmm too late, everyone's already, (speaks Spanish) - I have to warn you, my Spanish is horrible. - Good thing my English is not. - What's sad is that English was my second language. - You know, the beauty of being the only two Spanish speakers in the room and I think we are, is that when we don't want anyone else to know what we're saying we just have to say it in Spanish, you know? (speaks Spanish) I'm sorry, I'll turn around and wait. - You could also turn around and wait outside. (laughs) (water running) - So how do you know Toni? - We're old friends. - Old friends? - Old friends. - hmm and you're staying with her? - Yes. - Hmm. - What? - What are you doing here? (sighs) - I don't know. - You don't know? - What are you doing here with me? - I don't know. (sighs) - [Adina I love your perfume, it's very sensual. (speaking Spanish) (laughs) (speaking Spanish) - Thank you, my mother thinks so. - Do you work at the center? - A volunteer, I'm a painter by trade. - Landscapes? - Body art. - I would love to see that. (classical instrumental music) (speaking Spanish) - What? Que? (speaking Spanish) - Why so sad? (ambient chatter) - Julia, Julia. (classical instrumental music) - Julia, Julia. (bed creaking) - Where'd you go? - Just for a walk. - In the Bronx? (sighs) (floorboards creaking) - How long have you lived in this apartment? - Uh, like a year now. So you like Hilary? (laughs) - What? - I don't know, you kind of remind me of her. (footsteps) (classical instrumental music) (soft singing in Spanish) (melodic guitar music) (footsteps) (classical instrumental music) - He'd be running around the neighborhood like a chicken with his head cut off. Always getting in my way when I came home and then one day I stopped him. This innocent face didn't fool me. - Yeah, so she turned me into the devil. (both laugh) - But today "mi angel" a fallen angel. Cause that's what boys are, fallen angels. Now what type of angel, is yet to be determined. - And what are girls? - Angel catchers and every angel wants to be caught. - What the fuck are you talking about? Stand still. Wanna give it a try? - Don't worry, I wont bite. - Come on. - Today I'm a good angel. (rhythmic instrumental music) (ambient traffic) - Sorry about last night. The whole bathroom incident, I just get really protective over her. - Why? - She's been through a lot, I mean, well you should know. - It's been a while. - What happened? - Did you guys used to date? - Did you guys? Yeah, we did. - What happened? - Old habits, I mean, she's better now. At least, that's what she wants you to think but you gotta be careful with her. You guys, go back a ways or? - You could say that. - Rekindling an old flame, is that what this is? - I can't even remember the last time that I saw her. - Too busy making movies? Sorry, that's a fucked up thing to say. - No, you're right. - Well you're not busy now. - I don't really know what I'm doing here. - What are you scared of? - What? - You're coming at me from the same point of fear. - You're a psychologist too. - You know how animals can smell fear? Well, if we were in the woods right now, you'd be torn to pieces. - Well good thing I'm not in the woods. (laughs) - Your exactly where you should be. - I am? - Yup. - And where is that? - You tell me. - I'm in Brooklyn, I'm here with you. - Well, what about in here? - I don't know. - What do you see? - What are you trying to Barbra Walters me or something? - I'm just trying to have a conversation. - Okay, (scoffs) okay. I, Am tired, sad, confused, I feel alone and, I'm scared of everything I'm not sure about. - I don't watch a lot of TV and I don't go see movies, so I don't want you to get it in your head that I'm some sort of fan. - So you just wanna take my panties off an fuck? - What is wrong with you? - I was just kidding. - Why put up this guard? Is it like a LA thing? - I don't know, I thought it was a Bronx thing. - Well you're definitely not fooling me. (floorboards creaking) (sighs) - Hey. - Hi. - I'm sorry, I completely forgot that I told her she could do her body art here. She's getting renovations done at her place, does it bother you, are you okay? Okay. (music playing distantly) (singing softly) - Who's Adina? (floorboards creaking) - Open up. I know it's not your birthday but I wanted to get you a cake. For all the birthdays I've missed and all the ones I'm gonna miss. And just cause. Make a wish! - You make a wish, it's okay, I give it to you. - No! Why? You sure? Okay. Hmm. That's good. - Yeah, I like it. (speaking Spanish) (ambient traffic) - What are you reading? - Nothing. - Okay. (laughs) So, what are you thinking about? - What I would look like as a boy. - A boy? - Did you ever wish you were a boy? - Maybe, when I was younger. I don't know, I love being a woman now. Sex is better. - When you were younger? - Yeah, I remember thinking, I'd like to be a firefighter or a cop. Like something a strong man would be. - Women are firefighters and cops. - I know, but, you know, in movies it's always some, brooding man with a square head. - I thought you didn't go see movies. - Hmm, cute. - I've met lots of strong men. - Didn't you marry one? - I married a rich man who hires strong men. What do you know about him? - He hired painted models from me for the opening of his hotel. In Tribeca. - I wasn't there. - No, but you were on a giant wall in the hotel lobby. - You could tell it was me? - Of course. - He couldn't. And this is what you love to do? - Yeah, it is. - Why? - Cause it makes me happy. What are you like my school consular? - How would you like to paint me? - What do you want me to paint? - I don't know, you're the artist. What are you afraid of? (relaxing instrumental music) That night when we first met. - Was what it was. - And what was that? - I was alone. I don't do well in crowds. (laughs) And I saw this beautiful woman, I just needed to talk to her. I didn't know it was you, until I saw your face. I want you to know that I think you're, really sexy and beautiful. And I think it's cute when you try to speak Spanish (both laugh) and search for the words. And how you look at people when they talk to you, you have this inviting light in your smile. And how when you stand alone, you have this look like, that any moment some prince is gonna ride on in and whisk you away. And I guess in that moment I just wanted to be that prince. I'm glad I was able to be there, you know, when you needed someone to be there. (music pounding distantly) (water running) (classical instrumental music) (intense instrumental music) - I just didn't even know, okay? I didn't know she was your girl, she came up to me. She came up to me, we were hanging out, we were chillin' and I didn't know. - So what, you should have came to me now, now we all got problems. - But I didn't even know! But how was I supposed to know she was your girl? (intense instrumental music) - So how was it? - Hmm, it went real well. - That's great. - A lot of people donated, said that they knew people who would donate, I mean, it was, it went so much better than I thought it was gonna go. - Oh, that's amazing. - Yeah, it's great. Oh, there's the movie star! - Hello! (laughing) - All the bees and the blanket on the floor. Toni, poor Toni, she was picking them up one by one. Her hands smelled, oh my God, horrible! So bad, so bad. - Yeah. But let me tell you, the one that was really happy about it was the dog. He's like, "When is Toni having another project? "I'm getting hungry!" (all laughing) It took me like one hour and a half to make that. - Pigs in a blanket? - Well, I, I burnt two trays before, so when they came here I was in such a hurry and of course everything just blew in the air! Oh my God, what a day! (laughs) So I read you're from New York? - Yeah, I grew up in the Bronx. - Off the six? - No, that's J Lo. (all laughs) Kingsbridge, off the one train. - Ah! That must be a different place from LA, right? - Yeah, definitely it is, but I don't live in LA. (laughs) - Of course you don't. You should think of movie people leaving Hollywood, right? Near the Walk of Fame and shit. - How do you guys know each other? - Kate and I? - Hmm. - We're together, we're married. - A year now. - Wow! A year? - Ah ha, it all happened very fast, let me tell you. We went about it all wrong. We met at this party and we were drunk and high. And she drew a rose on my wrist and that was it. The next morning she was moving in. - Yup, sounds about right. - That's so sweet, she drew a rose. - Fuck sweet, that's her trademark. I'm telling you, that party, every girl had a fucking rose on their wrist. - Yes, they did. - So how long have you been married? You're still married, right? - A year as well. Yeah. - So you met him in one of his hotels? - No, no I met him on a film set. He asked me to join him for dinner and I did. And then he asked me to join him on a trip around the world. - Aw. - And I did and on the cliff side of San Francisco he asked me to marry him. And I did. We did get married in one of his hotels. - That must have been a beautiful wedding. - It was. - You know, my brother, he's a big fan and he found this photo of you. - Kate. - So well, I explained it already. If you don't mind, I brought you a pen and everything. - Oh it's okay, of course. - What? (laughs) - It takes two and I'm not stupid. She taught me that. - I hope he enjoys it. - He will, he's a big fan. (arguing in Spanish) (somber instrumental music) (ambient traffic) (birds chirping) - Hey. - Hey. You're alive. (laughs) - Barely. (laughs) - You go to school? - Yeah, Fordham. - You, you go to school? - Nah. - You gonna be late for class or something? - Yeah, but I'm always late for class. Okay then, uh. (laughs) I'm gonna go, see you around? - Hey, I'm glad you stayed over. - I'm, I'm not straight, okay? - Okay and I'm not a boy. Okay, Mondi. (speaking Spanish) - Why didn't you want to hang out at the party? (sighs) - I'm not really social like that. - Don't do well in crowds? - It's not really my thing. - No one really does well in crowds. You just, focus on one person and pretend no one else is there. - I'd rather just be with that one person and not have to pretend. - What was the fight about? - Stupid shit. You know, sometimes you just got all this frustration. All this anxiety, you gotta let it out. - What are you anxious about? - I don't know. I just want something to happen. Something to wake me up. - Yeah, I know. Yeah. (ambient music) How long will you be staying here? - Not too long. - Please don't tell Lawson about this. - About what? (dramatic instrumental music) (ambient traffic) (speaking Spanish brokenly) (laughs) (speaking Spanish brokenly) - Repeat? Oh, fuck. - I wish I was there for you. I wish I was there for her. I wish I was there for you, that's why I just stop wishing. - You should never stop wishing. - Why do you love me? I love you because you're good to me. - Marry me? Marry me, marry me. - Why do you love me? Why do you love me? Why do you love me? Why do you love me? (ambient music) - I Toni, take you Adina to be my wife. I promise to be true to you, in good times and in bad. In sickness and in health, I will love you and honor you all the days of my life. - I Adina, take you Toni to be my wife. I promise to be true to you, in good times and in bad. In sickness and in health. I will love you and honor you all the days of my life. (footsteps) (ambient music) - Mama? I'm very happy. I want you to know that I pray everyday that you find it in your heart to forgive me for whatever it is I did to you. (crying) I'm sorry you lost a daughter, I'm sorry I lost you. (Latin music) (laughing) - I'm gonna come back. - I wont be here. (zipping bag) (somber instrumental music) - Julia. - You coming back home? - Nah, not right now. You ever heard of Los Angeles? - Who's there? - Um, lots of people. Mickey! - I wanna go! - Okay, how bout you go and you say hi to Mickey for me? - No, you go. - Okay, I'll go but only cause you told me to. - You can go, you can bring Mickey back here. (laughs) - Okay. - He can stay in your room. (speaks Spanish) - I should go now. Hey, hey, hey. I'm gonna bring Mickey back and you better be here okay? Cause he's gonna need a friend, cause he's not gonna know anyone, okay? Okay, go play. Go play mami, go. Go momi, go play. Go play inside mami, go. (train honking in distance) (train rumbling) - When I first saw you, you looked so fragile and so beautiful. I don't know what it was about that day but I decided to walk over to you and you looked at me and said nothing. You just stood there and said nothing. I said hi and you smiled. I said hi and you smiled. (laughs) I don't know what it was about that day, about that moment but everything changed. What it was, what it was. It was something, something new. Something exciting. What it was about you, what it was was, something I will never be able to explain. (birds chirping) (somber instrumental music)
