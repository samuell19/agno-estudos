SO, HERE WE HAVE CHINA, WHO IS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. ON THE VERGE OF INDUSTRIALIZATION, BUT, ALL OF A SUDDEN, EVERYTHING SLOWS DOWN, AND CHINA'S PROGRESSION STUTTERS. [ SPEAKING CHINESE ] FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T SPEAK MANDARIN, WHAT I JUST SAID WAS, "THE CULTURE BECOMES STAGNANT." WHY? THERE ARE NUMEROUS POSSIBLE FACTORS HERE. ONE POSSIBILITY IS THE INVASION OF THE MONGOLS. WHEN THE MONGOLS TOOK OVER IN THE YUAN DYNASTY, THEY SET THE CIVILIZATION BACK. THE RULING GOVERNMENT DIDN'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS, SO THEY DIDN'T PROMOTE EDUCATION AS MUCH, AND THE CHINESE WERE FOCUSING MUCH OF THEIR ENERGY ON OVERTHROWING THIS FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. THEY WEREN'T CONCENTRATING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE. VERY GOOD. ANGELA? UM... BECAUSE... THE CHINESE WERE VERY PROUD OF THEIR CULTURE. AND... TO BE INFLUENCED BY OTHER CULTURES OUTSIDE, THEY DIDN'T WANT THE WAYS OF THE BARBARIANS TO COME INTO CHINA. THEY WERE BLOCKING OTHER PEOPLE OUT AND KEEPING TO THEIR OLD -- OLD WAYS. HI. HEY. SHH.
