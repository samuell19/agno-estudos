Do you want to eat? Reconstruction Is that how it happened? And then? Wait a second. What was the condition of the murdered one at that time? I was dizzy. I don't know. I was dizzy. - Can I have a glass of water? - Right away. Then Hristos Gikas pulled the rope. What did you do? I couldn't watch it and went to the kitchen. Then he swore at me. He was shouting at me to hold the rope and swore. - Who made the loop? - He did. And he gave it to me to spread it with oil, so it would slide. I was dizzy. I did whatever he told me. What about the murdered one, didn't he fight? He was a sick man. He fell down. He writhed twice. We realised that he died. And Hristos Gikas untied the rope from the door it was tied to. We heard my children's voices returning from school. He told me: "What can we do so that the children won't see it?" I am going to check the fox's hole. He doesn't fit in there. Shall we cut him? Your father left once again. I planted some onions in the garden. I was behind the door... and he couldn't see me. Eleni got out from inside... I grabbed him from behind... and she placed the rope in his neck and pulled it. Until he choked and fell down. - I didn't pull the rope at all. - She says that you placed the rope. Lies! I swear by my kids! She wants to eliminate me as well! Bring him. And you brought him here. We were afraid that her children might come. We heard their voices in the yard. We grabbed him and threw him in this hole... in order to hide him until it was dark. Then she went to the yard with her children. I left. I was drifting here and there. Late in the night I returned, as we had agreed. How is it going? You know how it is. Heads or tails? Take it. - What do you want? - I need to see you. I told everybody that Kostas left for Gianenna to Come in the night, Hristos. I can't. Tomorrow, or the day after that, I'll see. - Where are you going? - Gianenna. My wife's sick. Kaliopi! Come down. - I don't have an ID. Passport only. - That'll do. Did you work abroad? - What's your name? - Kostas Goussis. And your lady? - Huh? Sofia. - I didn't mean that. Was she abroad with you? Give me the letter. - Since when is it? - It's old. - Since when? - Since the first time you went to Germany. - A ticket for Athens. - What's your name? Kostas Goussis. 167,50. 167,50 "Tonight at Palladion, the Kaneli Troupe will present the musical comedy 'Soldier's Dreams' that went like a bomb at Agrinio. Tonight at Palladion! What happened? Let's go for a walk. - Mr Interrogator! - No pictures please. - So? - This is her first testimony, are you interested? Of course it's not a simple reportage, it's an investigation. "At Tefaia, on 8/4/1970, before me, Police Officer of Mesohorio, turned up Sofia Goussis, wife of Kostas Goussis, 35 years old, housewife, Christian Orthodox, and voluntarily confessed the following: 'On 7/3/1970 while I was at my husband's Kostas Goussis house at Tefaia we quarrelled for moral reasons because my sister-in-law Labrini told him that I wasn't true to him. During this quarrell he was saying that I had a boyfriend. He then attacked me with an iron from the window and hit me at my body. I took a rope and choked him. Then I went to the garden of my house and buried him. I repent, but it's late. I have nothing to add. ' So, Mr. Interrogator, in the beginning she took all the responsibilities. Yes, but we already knew about the hayward's accessorial guilt. With suitable treatment we extorted his confession. We isolated him and told him that the woman considers him as the sole cause of the crime. The known, usual method. Now they are blaming each other. Something more, Mr. Interrogator. Your view on the cause. Everybody says that the victim was the ideal householder. Honest, diligent and that he wasn't a barrier to his wife's relationships. As the only cause of the crime we should consider the immoral character of the accused woman. The remark is right. It's past all understanding. The husband... His tolerance. Well... Irressistible attraction to crime or ignoble financial causes. There is this version as well. - Anyway it's all about people with no morals. - What will happen with her children? - After agreement with her relatives the two young ones will be sent to an orphan asylum. Concerning the older daughter, an merchant prince from Giannena offered to take her as a servant girl or something like that. The house will be closed down and sold by her siblings. I didn't understand how it happened. I didn't mean it, I swear. I recall thinking to tell her that I didn't want any part in that. But I couldn't. I remember that. It was like she cast a spell over me. We are journalists from Athens. We're looking for the hayward's wife. - What did you do to my brother-in-law? - He went to Germany.
