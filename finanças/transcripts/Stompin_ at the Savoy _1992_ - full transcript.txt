[gentle music] - [Esther] 1939, the Great Depression. We came up to New York from North Carolina. We didn't know we were part of a big migration of Black folks from south to north. All we knew was there was nothing back home, no jobs, no money, no hope. Hope and dreams. They were never in short supply for Dorothy, Alice, Pauline, and me. All those nights we used to troop up to the Savoy. I guess we all had our hopes and our dreams. And I always knew I'd make mine come true. [gentle music] - Esther, did Thomas call yesterday? - No, ma'am. - Thank you. ♪ Savoy the home of sweet romance ♪ ♪ Savoy it wins you at a glance ♪ [baby fussing] ♪ Savoy gives happy feet a chance ♪ ♪ To dance - How is everybody? Here we go. ♪ Your form just like a clinging vine ♪ ♪ Your lips so warm and sweet as wine ♪ Pauline? Are you coming back this evening? - Hmm. ♪ Your cheek so soft and close to mine ♪ ♪ Divine ♪ How my heart is singin' ♪ While the band is swingin' - Esther, come on! Esther! Come on! ♪ Never tired of rompin' ♪ And stompin' with you at the Savoy ♪ ♪ What joy a perfect holiday ♪ Savoy where we can glide and sway ♪ ♪ Savoy let me stomp away with you ♪ - Paper, ma'am? Paper, ma'am? Paper? Paper? - Every Thursday this woman asks me, "Are you coming back this evening?" Shouldn't you know by now I ain't? [people chattering] Oh, I wish I had me a record player. I love that song. Mm! I am gonna get serious and hook up with a band. - [Esther] Mm-hmm. - [Pauline] My next job is gonna be singing. For I am a singer. [children playing outside] What you know good, Alice? - Hey, Pauline. - When I ask you, "What you know good?" Don't come give me no countrified "hey!" - You picking on Alice again? - She keep it up, she'll have me talking all dicty like her. - [Esther] Mm-hmm. - Nobody could ever call me dicty. I just don't want you to sound like you caught the last train out the cotton field. - Well, everybody wasn't lucky enough to be born in the Big Apple like you, Pauline. - Oh. - D here yet? - [Alice] She's in the bathroom. - Damn, I just wish one time I could get in there first. - I wish I had me some stockings. Esther, you wanna go down to the A&S with me? - No, I don't have no money to spare. I gotta save all my money to play the number this week. - Wish I could. - Well, it don't cost nothing to wish. Okay. 7-3-9, right? I played that number so many times I know it by heart. - I swear, I'll pay you back next week. - Mm-hmm. Oh D, I got a letter from my mama. She says your daddy's feeling much better. - Yeah, I got a letter from my sister, Cora. Said Papa might be going back to work soon. - If there's any work to get back to. Well, slow down, girl, where you headed? - World's Fair. - Again? Do you have any idea how many numbers you could combinate with that 50 cents you spend every time you go out there? - I haven't even seen half of it yet. - Mm. - Don't you wanna learn about the future? - I do. - Mm-mm. - Mine! Now, who's gonna go down to the Lafayette with me tonight? Oh, come on! The talent contest. I think I've got a good chance. - Pauline, we only get one night a week off. I'm sorry, but I'm going to the Savoy, honey. - Chick & Ella tonight. And I promised to meet Ernest. - Yeah, and I thought I'd meet y'all there after I see the Futurama exhibit. - [scoffs] You mean to tell me all y'all, my so-called friends, would rather go dancing than cheer me on at the Lafayette? - [All] Yeah. - So would I. [all laugh] [kids chattering] - You have a good time tonight, you hear? - That big bull stood on my foot the whole way, from Brooklyn to Harlem. I don't even think I'm gonna be able to dance. - Oh you will, as soon as you hear the music and see Ern. - Yeah, I'm telling you, they have these things that's gonna show movies right in your own home. Um, televisions or televisuals, and every home's gonna have one. Really! Really, that's what I saw. - Come on, let's go! - I'm gonna get sick Saturday, and see about amateur night at the Harlem Opera House. - [gasps] That's where Ella started! - Well, then I guess it's good enough for me. - Yeah, but are you good enough for the Opera House? - Will you drop dead, please? - Oh! I'm going to the ladies room. - Ooh, Chick Webb! - I wonder if Ernest is here yet. - Well, I came here to dance. Come on.

[crowd applauding] - Hey, beautiful. - I've been looking for you. - Mm-hmm, between dances. You look so... So good. [swing music] - Did you get it? - No. - You'll get it soon. - I thought this damn Depression was ending. And I haven't worked in three weeks. I should be hearing from the WPA any day now. - I know you will. [swing music] Come on. Can't let this good music go to waste. [swing music] - Next week I'm gonna be on that bandstand. - Oh. - Know why? I'm gonna be the new MC. - Ooh, my God! Ooh! - [Esther] Who is he? - If I knew his name, I'd be over there making use of it right now. - Hell, baby, you mean to tell me you don't know Walter Turner? - Well, you do? - My main man. Owns a cafe right down here on Lennox. - Well, I sure would like to meet him. - Solid. [swing music] - Oh, Pauline. [swing music] He's coming over, Pauline. - Uh, Paula, Dorothy-- - Pauline. - Pauline, Dorothy, Esther, I want you to meet Walter Turner. - I'm very glad to meet you. - Hi. - Hi. - You ladies come here often? I haven't seen you before. - Yeah, every Thursday, every other Sunday. - Hey, baby, you want to struggle? - Sure. - Yeah, we're here every Kitchen Mechanics' Night. - Would you like to dance? [swing music] - That look into my eyes crap didn't get over with him. [Pauline scoffs] - Well, it got over with you. - Why'd you ask me to dance? You know Pauline wanted to dance. - I already danced with her. With chicks just like her. I wanted to dance with you. [swing music] That's better. How long you been up in New York? - Five months. - From? - Hertford. Hertford, North Carolina. - Carolina? - Mm-hmm. - So how you like it up here? - I like it. It's big and you could drop dead, nobody would care. But here, there are all these different people doing different things. Makes me think maybe I could do something different, too. - Yeah, like what? - I don't know. Not housework, though. At home you're lucky if you got any job. But here, you know, I think maybe I got more of a choice. - See all these women here? They all work in some ofay's kitchen. And a lot of the fellas here ain't got no job at all. Have you never heard of the Depression? You never heard if you're white, you're all right, and if you're black, get back? - You don't work for no white folks. - Girl, I could just as easily be driving some white man's car. Yeah, you can do a little something for yourself, but just wanting it don't make it so. Unless you want it bad enough. [swing music] - Walter, that's some crazy car! - Oh! Well, I guess I'll see you next week at the Savoy. Or at your place, Walter. Goodnight. - All right, goodnight. - Come on, Esther. - [Esther] I'm coming. - Come on, Esther! - Goodnight. When am I gonna see you again? You, uh, you off Sunday? - Yeah. - Well, do you have any plans? - Um... Well, we're going to the Savoy early, around five. - What if I meet you there? - Okay. - See you Sunday. - Bye. - Esther. You slay me. [jazzy music] [bright jazz] [people clapping] - If he ain't here in 20 minutes, like the West Indians say, "I gone." [Esther sighs] - Hey. You looking for somebody? - Hi. - Looks kind of dead in here. Why don't you let me feed you? Come on. - No, uh-uh. No, I brought Dorothy and Pauline with me. - How come girls always travel in packs like rats? - 'Cause I was afraid you wasn't gonna show up. Besides, it wouldn't be nice to leave them. - Hey, oh! Did you really think I wasn't gonna show up? - I believe in being prepared for the worst. - Oh! This from the girl who was coming to New York to do all these different things. - Oh, you think that's funny? - Come on, sit down. Sit down. I think any time you want something and you go after it, that's great. So what you gonna do? - Oh, you're gonna think this is stupid. - Try me. - Well... Okay. See, I play the number every day, every week, and if I ever hit, I'm gonna be something just like you except I'm gonna open a beauty shop. 'Cause I used to do everybody's hair at home, I got a real flair for it. - Maybe I could help you. - How? - Maybe I know a lady who owns a beauty shop. I could call her up, tell her to give you a job. You know, shampoo girl, teach you how to do those heads. - You mean you just call this lady up and she'll give me a job just like that? - Mm-hmm. - And you're not afraid this lady'll get jealous? - Oh, Larraine's not really like that. Besides, she's my sister. [Esther laughs] - All right, Miss Johnson. You just step right over here to the shampoo bowl. - I thought she got married. - She's saying she did. Claims he's with Count Basie. The way she looks, more like Count Dracula to me. - She not doing so hot, huh? - Oh, honey, she looks so bad. All she have to do is close her eyes, she'd be dead. - Good afternoon, ladies! - [Woman] Hey, look who's here, Herman! - Anything for me this afternoon? - You know I do. - Ooh, girl, you old faithful. I meant anything else. [coins clinking] - I want to combinate on 1-6-8 for ten cents. - 1-6-8, that sounds familiar. - Ought to. Last three numbers of Walter's cafe address. - And I want to place 10 cents straight on 7-3-9. No, make that 40 cents. What you doing here? - [Woman] Don't press it so hard! - I couldn't take that woman and her uniform no more. - You lose your job? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, no. What you gonna do? - I don't know, find another one or maybe retire to Florida. [laughs] You know of anything? - Mm-mm. - Say, where is everybody? - [sniffs] Your mama went shopping. - Alone at last. - Boy, quit! And watch where you're walking. I just scrubbed there. - Alice, I like you. I really like you. - What would you do if your mama was on the other side of that door, listening to you right now? Probably die. I don't know why you keep bothering me. - Because I like you. And it doesn't matter that you're colored. - Not much, it don't. I'm light. So, to you that makes me better. Still colored, but better. A lot of colored people think that way too, Paul. But I don't. - Alice, I-- - I got a man. He's black as your shoe. He's good and handsome and I love him. If I had to choose between him or anybody else, anybody, I choose him. Now I got a floor to scrub before your mama gets home. - That's it. Do the same thing underneath that curl. Do both sides, that way it'll last longer. - And it's got to last me. Don't know when I'm gonna get back in. Getting ready for the season opener in Saratoga. - [Larraine] You going up there again? - Yeah, girl, and you should, too. There's no colored beauty shop anywhere near there. - What am I supposed to do with this place while I go traipsing up there? - Oh, let your operators take care of the shop. You're only gonna be gone a couple of months and you can make lots of money. Ow! - Ooh! - God bless! - Ooh! - [Larraine] Careful. - Sorry, Miss Brown. - How much you gonna pay me to let this woman practice on my head? - She could pay better attention to what she's doing if you'd keep still about your big money dreams. - Last season, I made $1,540 and that ain't no dream. And this season, I'm going to do even better. When that racetrack opens, there is a flood of tourists and gamblers and with the prostitutes and the maids and no colored beauty shop, you could just watch that money rolling in. - I'm doing all right here. - All right, but you can make one, maybe $2,000 in a few months after the racetrack is open. Ow! - You doing real good, Esther, but you got to pay attention. - I'm real sorry. [bright music] - Esther! Esther! Esther, Esther, did you hear? Did you see the paper last night? - No. - Esther, 7-3-9 hit! 7-3-9 hit, Esther! - Oh! - You rich! - Wait a minute, wait a minute, not my number. - Yes, it is, Esther! - No, I didn't-- - Esther, you played that number the other day with me for 40 cents! - But it's not my number. - Esther, right now you got yourself $200 coming! - Ain't nothing beats having a rich old lady. - Except when it's having a rich young 'un. - Here. - Hallelujah! - We're gonna go out and celebrate tonight. And I mean really celebrate. [bright music] - [Woman] Now, see that? I'm gonna start playing. - Hm. [brassy music] - So I wonder what rents are like. How much you figure it would cost to get a place up there? - I don't know. [man laughing] - I thought I caught the smell of a cooking grease turner. - Probably your top lip, my man. [laughs] This here is Calvin and we have been going at each other since... Since forever. - You got to be Esther. I sure heard a lot about you. - Calvin owns this spot, or so he claims. - Ooh! How is everything? Anything I can get you? - No, thank you. - No, you can go ahead and get lost. [Calvin laughs] - Walter, I'm not trying to cut in. - Not that you could. [both laugh] - Holler if you need anything. It's a pleasure to meet you, miss. - Oh, it's nice, nice meeting you. - Calvin's all right, you just got to count your fingers after you shake that man's hand. - Walter, Walter, come on, now, tell me, how would I get fixtures for a shop? I wouldn't have to buy 'em, would I? I could rent 'em, huh? - You been working at Larraine's for three months. You ready to just get up and go? What do you know about Saratoga? What are the rents like? You're talking about leasing fixtures. You know how many you want to lease? For how long you want to lease them? How many customers you're planning on having? Do you know what the hell you're talking about at all? - No, I don't know. You know I don't know, Walter. That's why I'm asking you. All I know is I have to try. - All right. We take the day off tomorrow and we'll go up there and we'll look around, okay? - Okay. - All right. Now, this here is supposed to be a party. You having a good time, baby? You like this place? - Yeah, I do. - But? - I'd rather go to the Savoy. - I'd rather go to the Savoy. ["Stompin' at the Savoy"] [all clapping] - All right, all right! How y'all doing this evening? [crowd cheers] I said, are you ready? - [All] Yeah! - Is you ready? - [All] Yeah! - Well, then back on up and clear out this here floor. 'Cause you know what time it is, don't you? It's time to swing! Swing! Swing! [all cheering] ["Sing Sing Sing"] [all clapping] [gentle music] - You gonna wear that coat all night long? You want me to help you with it? - I can do it. - You know, to tell you the truth, I was kind of planning on tonight. Figured, um, a little nightclub, some celebrating, maybe, maybe I'd get you up here with me. I never figured you'd say what you said tonight at the Savoy. - I think of it every time I'm with you. I can stop myself thinking about it. [romantic music] Oh, you think I'm bad. - I hope so. [romantic music] - Oh. - Ooh, baby, you're something else. [romantic music] - Truly revolutionary art demands that the masses be the heroes and capitalism the enemy. - [Man] Really, Martha. Your argument collapses when you remember that your corrupt capitalists are the only people who can afford to buy tickets to those Broadway shows. - Thank you. - Dorothy. Everything's going splendidly, isn't it? Would you please see if you can help Mimi? - Yes, ma'am. - Very good. - Bill, I think this play is going to make you. - Yeah, well, I've heard that before. - I mean this is exactly the kind of part that draws a lot of attention. - I hope so. Hi. - Um, what are you looking for? Maybe I can help you. - I found it, but I don't understand what it means. - Well, what were you looking up? - [Dorothy] Capitalism. - Capitalism. "A form of economic, industrial, and social organization "of society involving ownership, control, "and direction of production by privately owned "business organizations." Uh, that means the big guys who own the businesses are rich and the working people stay poor. - Thank you. - Yeah. I was a communist last year. I thought it would help me with these big-time left wing producers, but, uh, it didn't. I'm Bill Jeremy. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't go. I mean, this party's had it. I can tell you the place stinks. I know because I'm in it. Just what tonight's all about. When a play opens, it's tradition to have a party and to wait for the reviews in the morning papers. - I know that. - So, what I was thinking was that maybe you and I could, uh, ditch this funeral and go have a cup of coffee somewhere. - What did you say your name was? - Bill Jeremy. - Mm. Mr. Jeremy, in this house my name is Dorothy. I don't have a last name when I'm here. I am not some guest who can come and go as I please. I work here. - [Ernest] Alice, you're acting like I'm asking you to commit murder or something. For God's sake, Alice! - [Alice] I ain't getting caught butt-naked under no Coney Island boardwalk! - [Ernest] Sweet-pea, I got feelings. For God's sake, Alice, I'm a man. - Ernest. Don't you think I want you to hold me? I love for you to touch me. Maybe if we take it easy. - Take it easy. - Not get so excited. - Mm. [woman laughing nearby] Hey! Ain't you got no decency over there? This is a public place! - [Man] Oh, man, drop dead! - I'll drop! - Ernest. - Let's get outta here. Wait a minute. Let's get married. - How can we? - Well, we just do it. Come on, sweet-pea. The world is full of poor colored folk and most of them are married. And look, look, I know I'm gonna be hearing from Jacobs real soon. I know it. - Let's wait till you do get the job, Ernest, till we can afford it. - Well, if we wait till we can afford it, we never will. Besides, ain't you heard? ♪ Two can starve cheap as one Oh, come on, please. Please, please, please. Please, sweet-pea. Marry me. Come on, please? Please marry me. Please, please, please, please. Please marry me. - [Dorothy] I got to call Miss Rothstein. - What? Why? - I got to look for a new job, too, Ernest. I'm not gonna be living in when we get married. I'm gonna be spending my nights at home with you. [Ernest laughs and exclaims] - She's mine! Sweet-pea, I love you! Woo! [bright music] Yes! [keys jangle] [light clicks on] - Long time no see. Where you been the last two days and nights? - Shut up. [both laugh] - Oh! Nothing like the cheery spirit of home after a hard day's work. - You got a job? Singing? - No. But I ain't living in. - Go ahead on, girl. - Ah, no kid, she just talks on the telephone all day or plays Mahjong with her friends. [laughs] So, tell me about you and Walter. - Well, we went to a nightclub, took the day off, went to Saratoga. - Oh, I ain't talking 'bout that, girl. Come on! - I know you ain't. [laughs] Oh, Pauline, I'm so excited, I just got to tell you. You know with that money I won? I'm gonna-- - Money you won? When 7-3-9 hit, that is Alice's number. - Well, Alice don't own that number. - Well, she don't own it, but she always plays it. - No, I always play it and she never pays me back. - Well, she would, if she could. I mean, she was out of work all that time 'cause she was sick. - Now, wait a minute. I play the number and when it doesn't hit, I take the loss. And now when it hits, I'm supposed to give her all the money back? Uh-uh! - Es, you could at least split the money with Alice. - I'm going to Saratoga for the season and I'm gonna open up a beauty shop. Now, that's gonna take every penny I got and more besides. And Walter's gonna stake me to the rest. - Does Walter know what you're doing? Do you know what you're doing? - I know there's money to be made and I'm gonna get mine. [gentle music] - Es, you better take it slow. You want way too much. And it's gonna hurt when you don't get it. - You know that's what's wrong with people. They always tell themselves no before they get started, don't think they deserve nothing. Well, ain't nobody gonna tell me no and I sure as hell ain't gonna tell myself. [gentle music] - [Radio Newsreader] Here in Saratoga. We were expecting rain, but it looks like things are gonna be dry. They should run fast. Just to let you know, Marseilles is fine-- [radio clicks off] - Ooh, girl, we so glad to see somebody like you finally come up to Saratoga! Honey, I want the works. Wash, press, curl, French curl, manicure! You do manicure, don't you? - [Esther] Mm-hmm. - Well, get to moving, honey, 'cause time is money! - Money! [both laughing] - Smoke. - Uh. Er, well, a wash and press is $5. French curl is 2.50 extra. - What? Girl, my girl in New York don't charge me but a dollar! What you gonna do, guarantee my hair stays straight for life? [woman laughs] Shh. - Well, if you wanna waste four hours going and four hours coming back, you ought to go back to New York and get your hair done. But like you said, time, is money. - You a thief, girl. Come up here trying to rob us 'cause you got us at your mercy! Come on, Doris, let's get on outta here. Child's crazy. - Hey, you charge the same up here for your work as you do in New York? - You did it now. - Look... - You ain't in the business, but you got a heart like whore. Come on, girl, do me up! [Doris exclaims] [all laughing] I can't wait! Come on, get that, but listen, you gonna be here all day, honey, 'cause her hair is nappier than mine. - Oh, no, no, you got nice hair. - Thank you, child. [car horn honking nearby] - Oh, hi. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Dorothy. You're not at the Bennett's house right now. Wait, wait a minute. What is your last name? - Van Roy. - Miss Van Roy. [diners chattering] - I always wanted to see Greenwich Village. A lot of, um, extraordinary people live here. - I'll say. Um, you know I don't live too far from here myself, if you'd like to come over and see my place. - Oh, oh. Oh, no, I couldn't. - I wasn't, I wasn't trying to, um... Yes, I was. [both laugh] - One day I'm gonna have a place of my own. - You share an apartment with someone now? - Three other girls. And it's not an apartment, it's a room. No kitchen and the bathroom's down the hall. But of course, I'm only there on Thursdays and every other Sunday. - Right. Sounds a little crowded. - Well, at least I have a place. Some girls live at the beach or in the park on their days off. Oh, when it's warm enough, I mean. - [Radio Newsreader] Here's a sad note for music lovers. Drummer bandleader Chick Webb died yesterday in Maryland of tuberculosis of the spine. - Chick Webb. - [Radio Newsreader] Great loss. - Dead. - [Radio Newsreader] Let's listen to "Dreams Come True." - I gotta go. I gotta go call Esther. - Who's Chick Webb? - He was something, wasn't he, girl? He was colored and crippled. - I feel worse than when my own uncle died. I didn't even know he was sick. - He didn't let nothing stop him from what he wanted to do. D, you there? - Yeah, um... I'm here, Es. So how you doing up there? - Well, I'm doing real good. - [Dorothy] I gotta go. - All right, then. Well, you tell everybody I said hi. - [Dorothy] I will. - Bye-bye. - Bye. [coin drops] [coins clinking] Thanks. Miss Bennett, she gave me this coat. She's pretty nice. She hardly ever wore this one at all. - [Woman] Here, thank you. - [voice breaking] I want my own place. What's to stop me? [sniffles] I'm going get my own place! [gentle music] - Pauline, would you mind? You're not leaving? - It's seven o'clock. - I know what time it is, but you're supposed to do the wash today. - [scoffs] You had me working here all day. I scrubbed floors, I washed the walls. It's not like I was sitting around waiting for the hot water heater to be fixed. - I am not going to argue with you. If you leave here now, don't bother to come back tomorrow. [gentle music] - Well, if you're letting me go, pay me what you owe me. You should have seen her face when I stuck my hand out and said pay me. [laughs] It was too cold. [laughs] [sighs] So this new job's gonna be a killer, huh? - You don't have the job yet. - [scoffs] Oh... Any job that takes me out the kitchen and into a nightclub is mine. Shoot, I'd fight Joe Lewis for it. - All right, Joe Lewis. - Hunter's Lodge, huh? On Lennox.

Next opening, be right in line to get it. Beats domestic work. [musicians chattering indistinctly] Well, don't kill yourself thanking me, woman. - I will when I have something to thank you for. - Little girl, stop playing with me. - I'm not a little girl and when I start playing with you, you're never gonna want me to stop. So, when do I start, boss? - See you tonight. Eight o'clock, cuz. [Pauline laughs] - Right, we can have coffee here. Come in. Come in. [door thuds shut] Great apartment, huh? And only 20 a month. It's all yours. - Mine? How? Why? - Landlord's a friend of mine. He owed me a favor. I introduced him to an actress I worked with last year and, uh, he was very appreciative. Plus I, uh, I painted the place for nothing. How do you like it? - I don't know what to say. The landlord, he's willing to rent to me? He knows I'm colored? - It's not like that. This is the Village. This is your place if you want it. Coffee? - I'll get it. Well, since this is my place. I guess I can find everything. - You don't know how many times I've gone over that kiss in my mind. I was rehearsing what I was gonna say. - This is something I didn't figure on. - I can't stop thinking about you. That day I took you to MacDougal Street, the cafe. I waited outside for two hours, it was cold. Dorothy... Dorothy, You have to know how I feel. - I guess I do. But, but, I gotta think about this. I just can't take up with a white man without thinking about it. It scares me. - I know you gotta be real nervous. Let me tell you something. I don't give a damn about what anybody thinks.

Me teaching the teacher something. - I'm gonna hound you. Every time you turn around, every time you go to the market or take a walk, I'll be there. I'll just make myself part of your life. I'll win you over 'cause I'm a very winning fellow. I don't take no for an-- - Can't you stop talking no time? [gentle music] This is not the time to talk.

[guests chattering] - Hey, Tony, looking good. - I dig this! Four rooms all to yourself and the Village! Girl, that takes nerve. How you afford all this? It's a hard place. - Time payments, mostly. - Hm. This is a hard place. Hunter. Hunter, ain't this pad copacetic? - Oh, well, mm. - We're gonna have a toast to the bride and groom. - Walter, you do it. - [Man] All right, okay. - [Woman] That's a good idea. - Yeah. Come on over here, honey-bun. - Oh, look at this great couple. May you have all you want, may you want all you have. And if not, may you always have each other. [all chattering] - [Woman] To the bride and groom! - [Woman] Congratulations! - Hey, hey! Hey! I thought this was supposed to be a party. I wanna dance! - Dorothy, you ain't even here most of the time to enjoy this place. - I know. - Well, you're working yourself to death for something you can't even enjoy. - I bet it's worth it for the time you do spend here, huh, Dorothy? - Well, you still gonna be living in now that you're married? - Well, no. Wouldn't be no point in being married if we only saw each other once a week-- - Well, see, that's what I'm saying about this setup. Just don't seem to be much point in it. - The point is it's what I want. - And the point is, you're jealous. [guests chattering] - You need some help? I'm sorry, okay? I am a little jealous. Everybody's moving on and I'm a hat check girl sitting in a closet. - That Calvin seems like a really nice guy. - Well, he ain't no Dark Gabl. He's okay. [both chuckle] - You know where the Hotel Theresa is? - Well, sure, yeah. It's the nicest colored hotel in Harlem. Never thought I'd see the inside of it, though. [laughs] Thanks, man. - Man, I might get married soon myself. - Oh! - You can tighten me up. - Thanks, man. Thanks. - [Walter] Yeah. [guests chattering] - How you making out in that greasy spoon? - I can't complain. - You got to get a liquor license, man. People always drink. Even if they kids is starving. This nightclub is easiest racket I ever had and it's legal. [laughs] That's the killer. All right, so I had to spread a little jack around to get the license, but that's the way it goes. It sure beats frying up neck bones for a bunch of squares. [Pauline laughs] [guests chattering] And I'm making out pretty good with that cousin of yours, too. - Who? Oh, yeah. Now, you know, you and her would make a nice couple. - I ain't coming on that tab, man. She's fine, but-- - I don't know, man, your nose looks a little open to me, brother. [guests chattering] - Well, I think I might be looking at my ticket out of Franklin Avenue. - Stop that, Pauline. - Man. Man, oh, man, that Walter is some guy, huh? - Mm-hmm. I wonder what made him do it. He don't hardly know us. - Just a nice guy, I guess. Mm. Boy, he's something crazy for that Esther, though, ain't he? - Uh-huh. - I bet they'll be getting married soon. Alice, um, some things I'm not real good at saying. See, I ain't had a lot of girlfriends before. You about the nicest person I ever met. The prettiest. So I don't want you to be scared. - I ain't scared. - 'Cause you know, I might get a little carried away. And I want to tell you that... Oh, God, I love you. Mm, I love you so much. Now, I know women feel a little different about these things. - How do you think women feel? - Well, they don't... Well, I think that maybe they, they gotta get used to it. Don't you? [chuckles] - I don't know. I ain't scared, though. Maybe a little nervous, but I could never be scared of you.

But now he's on WPA, so with him working steady and me getting some day work, maybe y'all can come over for dinner or something. - But where is Dorothy? How come we never see her no more, huh? - You just want to throw it up to her that you got an apartment, too. - That's right. I ain't killing myself with no time payments, no layaways neither. - Sounds like you got your mojo working on Calvin. - Es, when you gonna open up your shop? - Next week. Me and two other operators. Except they're renting. The shop is mine. - Well, let's go to my place. Come on. [people chattering on street] Now, my apartment ain't as nice as Dorothy's, but then again, I ain't paying for it. [laughs] - Oh, you're paying for it, girl. Dearly. [Pauline laughing] - That son of a bitch! Oh! [bills rustling] You ain't funny, Hunter. - Wasn't supposed to be funny. It's supposed to teach you to behave yourself.

[Pauline scoffs] - He don't have to bring it back-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I am not a whore! I've been living on my own since I was 16 years old. I could have been living off men all along instead of doing housework, sharing a tiny room with three roommates, three girl roommates. - All right, I um... I'll call the store first thing tomorrow and have them bring the stuff back, okay? - It don't mean nothing if you've got such a low opinion-- - Look, baby, baby, I want to. - Suit yourself. - Come on, cuz.

Hi, baby. - I ought to wear your behind out. [door slams] - What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? - You send these things out to Larraine's customers and you ask me what's wrong with me? You know, Larraine's one of the strongest people I know. I can't remember the last time I seen that lady cry until you sent out these damn things. - I just sent out cards saying I was opening my shop. - To Larraine's customers. You are stealing Larraine's customers. After everything she's done for you. How could you do that? - Larraine's customers are the only people I know. Who else I'm 'a send 'em to? This is just business. Well, for God's sake, Walter, if it ain't enough nappy heads in Harlem for both of us, I just don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, babe. You know I didn't mean it. Well, I love Larraine. I would never do anything to hurt her, you know that. Oh, Walter, don't be mad at me. Okay. I'm gonna get dressed right now and I'm gonna go talk to her myself-- - No, no, no. No, no, no, listen. - Hm? - I'll do it. It's better coming from me. I know how to talk to Larraine. - Mm. - You better not do anything like this again. - No. - I'm serious. - Mm. [rain falling] [Alice coughing] [door clicks open] [Alice coughing] - Hi. - [Ernest] Hi. - How'd it go today? - I ain't find nothing. And I ain't eating this. - I'm so tired of you. - I ain't eating no white folks' leftovers. - Ernest, meals are included with my pay. I bring it home so I can share with you. I ain't digging the garbage for it, I ain't begged for it, I earned it-- - I ain't eating no white man's scraps. - Well, what you gonna eat then? There ain't nothing else here. [silverware clattering] Pauline invited us to New Year's Eve at Hunter's Lodge. I want to go. Do you hear me? - I heard. - Well? - You kill me. You sit here about to eat what the ofays throw out and you talking about going out nightclubbing somewhere? - It ain't gonna cost you nothing, Ernest, if that's what you worrying about. That Calvin Hunter, he's gonna pay for it. You gonna sit here and tell me I can't go somewhere that's for free? - So you want to go sponge off your friends? - I don't care! I want to go! If I wait for you to take me someplace, I'll be as long getting there as I was getting grown. - Don't you think I would like to be able to take you out? Hell, baby, I would like to be able to feed you! Me! - Well, what's wrong with you? How come you can't hold a job no time? [dramatic music] - Well, that took you long enough, but you finally said it, didn't you? - Ernest. I didn't mean it, Ernest! [door slams] [gentle music] - Hi. I was walking downtown and I went in this place for some coffee and it turns out the night dishwasher never showed up. [gentle music] Maybe you could buy something. A new dress or something for when we go out with Pauline. I'm trying, Alice. I swear to God, I'm trying. - I know you are. - I've just been so worried about you. You're not feeling well. You shouldn't be working. I want to take care of you, I want to be a real husband to you, be as important to you as you are to me. - You are. [dramatic music] Nothing else matters if you stop caring about me. [camera snaps] - Oh! [blows paper horn] - I'm so glad to see 1939 get the hell out! - Yeah! - The '40s has got to be better! - 1939 did all right by me. - No, no, it's going to get better. You know why? 'Cause I've got some big plans for 1940. - Ooh! - How you doing? - I'm okay, you? Esther, where's Dorothy? - She's coming. - Anyone want to hear about my big plans for 1940? - [Calvin] I do. - When is Dorothy gonna get here? - First, I'm gonna get myself a liquor license from a friend, from an acquaintance who will go unnamed. - She said something about being late. - Are you paying attention? I don't think she's paying attention. - Yes, baby, I'm paying attention. - Is she paying attention? - Now, you're trying to get a license from Calvin, who doesn't want to be called by name. - How come you want to call me names? - Calvin. - Man, will you shut up? No one's calling you names. Now, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna turn the cafe into a nightclub when I make enough money. - [Pauline] Mm! - [Calvin] All right. - Might ask this chick I know to marry me. - Oh! - [Calvin] Uh-oh. - Oh! - That's nice. - Well, who is she? Anybody I know? - No, just some old chick always talking 'bout money, money, money! - Oh! - That's you! - [Esther] That's nobody I know. - They all talk about that, Walter. - Oh, come on! [all laughing] - Not my sweet-pea. [all laughing] - Hi. I'm sorry we're late. I want you all to meet Bill Jeremy. That's Esther and Walter over there and that's Pauline and Calvin. Calvin owns this club. And that's Alice and Ernest Johnson. - How you doing? - [Bill] Hi. Hello. - How you doing? - I'm all right. - Pleased to meet you. - [Bill] And the same. - Well, you just missed the picture. We just got our picture taken. - Well, we can just take another one. Bernice! Bern-- - Don't strain yourself, man. - How come? - Mm. [Calvin laughs] [quietly] Bernice. - Calvin, Calvin, listen, man. What about my liquor license, man? Now, I have given you enough graft to paper all the offices in City Hall, man. - Graft? I thought you just applied for a license. - [laughs] A white man just pays for a license. Nigga's gotta pay through his nose. And he just pays and pays and pays. - Yeah, well, uh, [chuckles] it's funny, 'cause I've had to deal with this trouble myself because I'm colored just like you, man. - You tellin' me you a spade? - Well, he's like Adam Powell, baby, you know. - Or, uh, Walter White from the NAACP. He's very light. - Yes, quite fair, mm. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, in that case, then, I'll just follow and be me. Bernice! [laughs] Hey, Bernice! Come here, baby. I want you to... Want you to have another picture took. Everybody get in close. - [Bernice] All right, everybody. - Close! - [Bernice] Look this way, smile! - Oh, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

Same boyish grin. Same old Bill Jeremy. - Okay, okay, I give. What's new? - Oh, nothing. It's just that these magnificent features are being screen-tested in Hollywood next week! - You gonna be in movies? - Yeah, if they like me! Talent scout from Warner saw me in "Forest" and next week I'm on my way. A lot of actors wouldn't go. Dedicated to the theater, the saps. This is the greatest opportunity. It's the best break I've had. You don't seem too happy with our good fortune. - Your good fortune. And I'm very happy for you. - Hey. Our good fortune. You're coming with me. Dorothy, you are coming with me? - No. I'm not. - We'll get married. - I never heard you talk about marrying me before. Look, you taught me a lot of things. Now I'm gonna teach you a saying. Keep the niggers in their place. This is my place, right here. - Like hell it is. Hey, nothing's to stop us from being just the way we are right now. We'll be in California instead of New York. What's the difference? - Oh, yeah, and you'll have one of those big, fancy Hollywood parties and I'll dress up like the maid. Won't nobody ever know the difference! - No, I never treated you like that! - You didn't have to! - I never felt that way! - That's the way it is. You come here and you pretend on Thursdays and every other Sunday. - I love you. I wasn't pretending. - Yes, you were. You were pretending that there's nothing wrong about loving me. And that's okay. But don't you dare try to take it outside this room. What you gotta be is realistic. That's it. And the only place you don't have to be realistic is right here. - That's a lot of crap. We can do anything we want and I want you. Look, I'm still gonna call you. I'm gonna write you, I'm gonna badger you just like I always used... [dramatic music] I never once looked ahead to a time when you and I wouldn't be together. [dramatic music] - Nothing lasts forever. Especially nothing like us. Even I knew that. [dramatic music] [telephones ringing] - Why didn't Ernest or the hospital contact us? We could have done something. We could have taken care of her. - Well, I'm here and I'll take care of her now. [telephone ringing nearby] - [Nurse] All right, I have that. Now, have you had it too? - Yeah, I had it myself. - I see. Alice Johnson was here. Died two weeks ago, buried by the City of New York. [telephone rings nearby] - Well, why weren't we contacted? Why didn't anybody know about this? - There's no record of relatives here. - Well, she has a husband. He's away in the CCC. - All right, then. Do you know where his camp is? - No. - Where his company is? - Uh, Ernest... - Look, I got this letter from her. Now, you must have known that she wasn't alone. I mean, she must have sent a letter to her husband, too. - How are we supposed to know who she writes to? We get hundreds of cases a week. We see it all the time. No next of kin, no correct address, no family doctor. - No money. "Dear Esther, "The Board of Health come and got me. "I don't know where Ernest is. "How come I haven't heard from him? [Esther sniffles] [letter rustles] "I get money, but no word. [sniffles] "Tell everybody where I am. "This is why I do not call them. "Come and see me if you can. "Love, Alice." - I can't stand thinking about her being all alone. At a house. At that lousy charity ward at Rikers. - She got sick. You can't blame nobody for that. - Yeah, I can. - Well, you definitely can't blame Ernest. That man loved her. It wasn't Ernest's fault. It was the life she led on account of being with him. On account of being poor. - Love killed her, I guess. [Pauline sighs] [vacuum whirring] - Dorothy. Dorothy, I think you better come out here! - Hey, girl. Big sister, looks like your poor relatives have come to stay! [laughs] - Hey, yourself. Where's Clifton? - Child, he's long gone. I came to seek my fortune in the big city. We ain't gonna cause you no problems, take up hardly no room at all. I don't know how to get to your place. You gonna have to give me a key. [jazzy music] [crowd chattering] - [Esther] Well? - It's gonna be a little while yet. - It's already been an awful long time, Walter. Are you sure you can trust Calvin? - It took him five years to get his license and he had all those connections from being a numbers runner. - Well, why is it so hard to get a liquor license? - Why is it so hard being colored? You tell me. 90% of the joints up in Harlem is some spade fronting for a white man. They don't let us have nothing. That's why I'm gonna fool 'em. Because see, this license is gonna be mine. And the bread from it is gonna be all mine, too. Calvin got one thing right. Folks will buy booze when they can't buy nothing else. [jazzy music] [motorcars rumbling] [horn honks] - [Driver] You're gonna end up being a hood ornament, girl! [traffic rumbling] [people chattering] - [Bill] Dorothy. Dorothy. You have to know how I feel. This is your place, you want it. - [Pauline] You're working yourself to death for something you can't even enjoy. [man laughing] [bright music playing] - Oh, hey, girl, where you been? - [Dorothy] Movies. - Oh, you know Nelson and, uh, this is Lucille. - Hi. - [Cora] And oh, that's Rose in there. I'll get those dishes later. There's some beer. [jazzy music] [tense music] [Dorothy moaning] [Dorothy muttering indistinctly] - Hey! [Dorothy screaming] [dramatic music] [Dorothy screaming] [dramatic music] - [Nurse] Here, let me fix that for you. - [Woman] That would be nice. - [Nurse] All right, can you... There you go, just lean up a little bit. All right, how's that? - [Woman] That's fine. - [Nurse] All right. You seem to be doing fine. I'll check on you. - I don't know what to do about her apartment. I can't afford it. And her things, she has, she has some really nice things. What am I gonna do with her things? [sobs] Oh... [traffic rumbling outside] [bluesy music] [jazz music] [Pauline scatting] - I was sure sorry to hear about your friend, uh, Dorothy, ain't it? - Mm-hmm. - Pauline tells me you two come to New York together. - Yeah. - Yeah, that's the way it goes. - I want the license. The liquor license. I want it. - You gonna start on me, too? Walter knows I'm good for it. - I didn't say nothing about Walter. I want the license. And I'll do anything I have to to get it. [jazz music] - I had a feeling about you. Walter's always big time talking about you, but I kind of thought. [laughs] Maybe I don't want money. - Well, I had a feeling about you, too. I never thought you wanted money. [jazz music] Does Walter have to know about this part of the deal? - Wouldn't be much point to it if he did. [all chattering] - [laughing] You something else! [all chattering] [door bangs open] - You got it all, huh? You had to have him, too. - [Esther] You want to talk about this some other time-- - No, I don't want to talk about it some other time! You couldn't have cared nothing about him, so why? - I don't think you want to talk about this now. - I think you better answer me now! - Oh, you want an answer? - Yes! - Well, just look up and down every street in Harlem. - Look at what? - Winos, whores, old people shouting to God or talking to themselves, raggedy and poor, asking for a handout. It's not gonna happen to me. - [scoffs] Money, that's all you see. That is all you care about. - I'm not gonna end up like Alice and Dorothy, waiting for some man to take care of me. - Oh, you got the nerve to stand there and talk about Alice after what you did with that number! - I didn't do nothing wrong, the money was mine. I played the number. - It would've made such a difference if you'd given them part of the money. - Well, I didn't! - [scoffs] Damn. You're just like my grandmother. There was nothing she wouldn't do for a dollar. And when she got old and played out, she sold liquor, and that's why she kept me around. So men would come up and buy liquor. My own grandmother tried to pimp me! She was low and she was rotten and I thought she was the lousiest bitch I ever met. Till I come up against you. [door thuds shut] [gentle jazz music] - Yeah! - Really? - Took her hat off. [both laughing] She took her hat off! - Calvin! - Yeah? [punch lands] [mirror shatters] - [Woman] Oh, my goodness! - [Man] Oh, Calvin! You all right? You all right? Hey, somebody get in here! [all chattering] [bluesy music] [door bangs open] [door slams] [slap lands] [bluesy music] [radio cracks] [door slams] [somber music] [passerby chattering] - [Man] You wanna go over there? - [Woman] Yeah. - [Man] They said they're gonna be there. Think they'll show up? - [Woman] Yeah, that's a good idea. [laughs] - I'll never forgive LaGuardia for shutting down the Savoy. But I read where it's gonna open up real soon. You know, you were right about Harlem nightclubs. They've had it. I'm doing okay with the liquor store, though. You hear from Pauline? - Uh, she was doing domestic work again. She's singing now, over in Jersey, USO. You know, when you first started changing, I used to think it was cute. Maybe I could have stopped it, helped you out. - I didn't change, I've always been this way. You just never could see it. Oh, Walter. Mm. - I used to love you so much. [Esther chuckles] I couldn't get enough. [Esther chuckles] That's over now, Esther. [dramatic music] [gentle music] - What you doing here? [people chattering] - [Pauline] Thank you so much, I am. [gentle music] [crowd clapping] - How you doing? You look great. - You look like money. - I'm doing okay. I talked to D. She asked about you. - How's she doing? - Okay. Well, not so hot. She's still not her whole self, but at least she's at home where her mother can take care of her instead of that hospital. I had to get her out of there. - It was really nice to you to do that. I meant to keep up with her and, uh... But I just can't. - You hear from Calvin? I don't see Calvin no more. I stopped seeing him after he... - After you got what you wanted. - I don't see Walter no more either. But I'll get him back. Pauline, Calvin didn't mean nothing to me and I didn't mean nothing to him. I just have to talk to Walter again. Explain it to him. He's so crazy about me. I just have to make it up to him. I'll get him back, I know I will. I just need one more chance. [drum beats nearby] Well, maybe I'll see you sometime. - Maybe. - [Woman] Well, you look handsome in your uniform! - [Man] Let me buy you a drink. [crowd applauding] - [Woman] Yeah! - [Woman] Yes!
