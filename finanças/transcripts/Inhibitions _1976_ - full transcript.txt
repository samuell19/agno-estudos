Here, Carol, sleep a little. Excuse me, would you have a light for me? Naturally. Many Thanks. OCCUPIED - Bonjour Madame, I'm glad to see you. - Good morning, Adida. - Did you have a good flight, Miss Levis? - Yes, thank you. - You are sure about the race here. - There are other reasons. - Thank you. - I did not say anything about your arrival. - Do not take it tragically. Her telegram came only two hours ago, so I booked for a suite first in the African hotel. The villa will be available tomorrow. I hope you are right, Madame. You'll probably have to take the bus, Adida. - You do not want me to drive you, madam? - I want to drive myself, thanks. Fuck you, girls! INHIBITIONS - To the casino. - Which casino do you want, sir? - In the casino. - Where is it, sir? - I want to go here. - Yes / Yes. Now I know, sir, what you want. - Well. I would like to speak to the director of the casino. Count Bellamore. I'm sorry, sir. This is not a casino. Playing is prohibited. - This is a nice museum. - I understand. - Many Thanks. - You're welcome. Oh, Africa. The black continent with its dark secrets. I have experienced incredible things here. Do not you feel that stimulating and exciting thing in the air, Carol? Say, why do not you say anything? Are you happy to be here with me? - Yes or no? - Yes of course. I feel as if I have awakened from a bad dream. - America somehow does not exist anymore for me. - Well, that's the way it is for everyone. The monsoon here in Africa acts like anesthesia. He blurs all traces of the past. I hope he does not whirl my back up. History is not one of my interests. - Emmanuelle, were not you happy here? - You can not exactly say that. But this time things are a little different. From now on I live for the future and you help me, Carol. - Cheers. - On the love. - On the love. Why did you marry your husband even though you did not love him? Do not you think that's my thing? Come on, honey. Hey, what's up? Am I disturbing you, darling? - No, but I... - Oh, come on, its not childish, darling. Wait, I'll scrub your back. Come relax and do not behave like a naughty kid. Then a little powder and perfume and you smell like a delicate rose. - You're like Denise. - And who is Denise please? My sister. She always scrubbed me. - And did you like her? - Yes, of course. - More than me? - I do not know. - And did she also stroke you like me? - No, not like you. - And do you like it? - Yes. - Yes? What do you want? - A room. My name is Peter Smart. - Six, okay? - Okay. Thank you. - You are very beautiful. - That is not true. But it is like that. You are pretty, because you are young. And I envy you for that. How so? You are still young, too. - Not as young as you, and that's scary. - In what way? At some point I will see myself in the mirror and realize that I am no longer young. - Then it's all over. - What do you mean by that? - Then I commit suicide. - Why are you saying that? You will always be beautiful and wonderful. No, something drives me crazy. Darling, you are always so submissive. Why do not you fight and prove your individuality? You walk around like a beaten dog. I prefer rebel cats. You do not have to talk to me about the mouth. Submissive flattery I hate like the plague. That's not fair of you, because I've never been submissive, and you should know that I only say what I think. I think you have no right to criticize me. I work here as your secretary. Quite criticize my work, because you pay me for it. But for nothing else. If you would rather have another secretary, then say so. - And I'm in the next plane. - That's a lot better. That's exactly what I want you to do. The little wild animal, that needs a trainer who controls and trains it. - Your tea, sir. - Thank you. Its about time. Emmanuelle Levis, owner of the largest horse racing stable in our country, lets her favorite Arabian stallion Nembis at the Golden Cup in the next week go to the start. What do you mean, how should I wear my hair, up or down? If you carry her high, the necklace looks better. It's beautiful, Emmanuelle. It was my husband's last gift. - This is peculiar. - What's strange, Carol? I mean, you still wear it. I was afraid of him, not of his gifts. If I carried it, I would feel uncomfortable. - Maybe I feel that way. - Then I find it wrong to wear it. No, I do not think so. It's a game. Almost like poker. The whole life is just bluff. Never show your true feelings no matter what happens, otherwise you are done. When you hear people talk like that, you get the feeling that you are very cold. Every game has a risk, including this one. And you lose when you are lonely. - I find that very sad. - Tonight we have some fun, and I'll show you that all men are just puppets. You look fabulous in your borrowed tuxedo. Most would think you a real count. You say it like I'm not. Even if you do not believe it, it can still be true. When our friend Peter is here, he will explain to you what I am in reality. A simple title is worth more as a noble character or fortune. Do you understand? Yes, but I would like to know how he reacts when he gets it right, that our casino does not exist. He was always a good friend of mine, Gianni .. So why should he change his attitude towards me? There is no casino, so what? Look there. If I may go ahead. Here's your table, please. - Permit me, madame. - Thank you. So. May I recommend a lobster cocktail and a Dom Perignon, Madame. - Carol, what do you mean? If you are looking for something special, Madame, I recommend lobster au cognac. May I introduce you to Count Bellamore? He is a gourmet. - Then we follow his advice. - Very well. - Permit me, madame? - Sit down, count. - Gianni Fault. - Very pleased, Mr. Fault. - Yes. It is incredibly difficult for me to introduce a man to belly dancing. It requires sensitivity, and that's why you only see it in women. You mean that we are less sensitive? That's your interpretation, Graf. What do you say Madame, will your horses win? - I hope so. - I was a good friend. - He was an old-school gentleman. A gentleman? Hey! - Does one of you have a light? - Yes my friend. I have a light. Would you like to play games with us? - Okay. - You can also get started right away. - With pleasure. I have a date afterwards, but I like to play with them until then. Well. You sit down. You can get off whenever you want. - Does anyone of you know Count Bellamore? - Sure, who doesn't? - A born player who always loses. - And where can I find him? It depends on. He is in debt everywhere. - Maybe with Manu. - Ah yes, then I'll find him. - What for? Do you want to play games with him? - No no. Here you go. Why do you want to find him then? Well, we did business together a few years ago. Anyway, he let me know that he has some good things going on here. And now I am here. Couple good thing, yes? Take care. Prophet Muhammad once said: Whoever travels to happiness will never find it in life. You would have stayed home better. Maybe that's true, but somebody said that a real man is not afraid to change his original opinion. If friends are suddenly enemies, you will change your mind and learn a new truth. Divide the cards. Playing is better than talking. What can it be, sir? Can you tell me where I find Count Bellamore? No, I'm sorry, sir. I have not seen him for a week. - Aha. A whiskey. - Okay, sir. I know Count Bellamore. He is on the market every day, wasting his charm there. - Do you want a drink? - Why, surely. - What? - alcohol. They want to get drunk. - Are you a tourist? - no. - But you are American. - Very correct. - And what are you doing? Not easy to say. I ask myself that sometimes. - What are you doing, Peter. That's my name. - I'm Marlene and Belgian. And tonight I want to be entertained. And that's what I need: salad, Marlon Brando and scotch. Most scotch. Scotch for Madame. - Good Morning. Can I help you? - I would like to try this dress, please. Yes, very much, Madame. Would you please come in. - Madame. - Help me with the zipper please. Do you like women? Let's see what you keep hidden underneath. Do you like that? Is not that gorgeous, you beautiful Romeo? - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - And your girlfriend? - So you are not looking for me. - I did not say that. - No, not said, but look, Emmanuelle. - What's happening? - Nothing. This man is looking for you. - What do you want from me? - You can not remember, right? - No, to what? - The flight. - Oh yes, we arrived on the same plane, right? - That's right. - Did you enjoy the flight? - I can not complain. Excuse me, would you have a light for me? - Is that what you would like to have? - You are a smart child. It is certainly a family piece. No. Just an old lighter. My lighter. The possession of a man is his ruin. He makes him unfree. - That depends on his character. - Its possible. Goodbye. Maybe we will meet sometimes. Bye. - All right. I bought the scarf here. - Oh, let's see. They are late today. Most of them have already left. I'm hungry and want to eat something. We came to work, so we work. Listen to everything! Here's the biggest miracle for every man, young or old. A woman for life. A woman with eternal youth. Annabella, the girl for every occasion. She is submissive, never cheeky and incredibly happy. And always willing to donate the most delicious friends. Annabella is the perfect woman and she is yours for as much as $ 10. You do not buy the cat in a bag, we have a special offer for you. For $ 2 you can test them. Test Annabella for only $ 2. In our car, there is a real team atmosphere. For $ 2, you can do anything with her, with no further obligations, and we guarantee that you will be more than satisfied. - You said 2 dollars? - Yes, 2 dollars. You are the first today. That's especially good. - But do not take that long, okay? - Okay. This young man knows what is good. Once seen and already tried. The beautiful Annabella for only 2 dollars. Only today you can own it for only $ 2. 2 dollars. - Hey, Peter. You really came. - How are you? - Very well. - You look really good. - Gianni, this is my friend Peter Smart. - Hello. He's just getting right around us. ...- I told you, he's definitely coming. - And there he is. - Nice to see you. - How's it going? - Fabulous. Fantastic. Conditions have changed a bit, but that could be worse. - Main thing you're finally here, Peter. - Yes, we could use help. - Could you give us some money? - I think I can do that. - Say, where are you from? - California. - You are a pretty girl. - Come visit me sometime. - Thank you. Many Thanks. Listen, Peter. I have organized a game for tonight. - With a friend of mine. - If you want to play, but you need mice. You have arranged a game without having money? I had a feeling that you would arrive today. And I know you always have cash in your pocket. I deliver the victims and you the money. I thought you would bring the money, as usual. You can also be wrong sometimes. Poor Annabella soon looks like a patched bicycle tube just because their suitors are so stormy. - And what's next? - Hello, do you need help? Oh yes, I think we need your help. Occasionally men can be useful too. Enough now, you gang. Get out of the car. The aunts want to go home. Yes you also. Come on. So. Mission completed. Your car recaptured. Listen, allow me to give some wise advice? It is a rough area here. It is not without danger for two pretty girls like you, walking around here alone. - You could kidnap us, right? - Its possible. - Maybe that will be very exciting. - For a masochist sure. - Do you know what your mistake is? - no? - You would be much nicer, if you did not always play that self-confidence. I do not need to play this. I am so. - Good day, Count Bellamore. - Good day. - We are glad to see you. - The pleasure is mine. - You sit down. Be welcome here. - Thank you. - You are unbelievable. - Who? - Well, these people here. Even at his age he works like a slave. - Just to earn a little food. - So life is. There are two categories of people. Those who work for money and those for whom the money works. My late husband belonged to the last category. He was a millionaire and should never know what work is. And since my husband is now dead, I am forced to belong to the same category. - Hello. You are American, are not you? - Yes. - Are you here on vacation? - Something similar. My name is Robert Lee Francis. I come from New York. - I live on the island. - I live there too. In the Levis villa. - Can we meet? - Why not? For sure. Carol, would you please come here. I open with 500, okay? OK. Cards. Two. None for me. I set 1000. I want to see. Gentlemen, I think I have no more money. They won everything. But I can write you a check if you are right. I'm sorry, but not that I do not trust you, but I can not accept. That's too bad. But I understand you. In order. I own a racehorse that starts next week. It's worth ten times what I've lost. Here is the deed of ownership. I want to put this horse. Can you accept that? - That's acceptable, yes. - Come on, Peter, give cards. Right, that's fine. Thank you. So then. What is the name of the owner? - Abdel Moussa. - Abdel Moussa. - And the name of the horse? - Charlie. - Charlie. - Right. - And the name of the stable? - That's a funny name. Rediquori. - Rediquori. - Rediquori. So you fished a friend now, eh? I only saw him for two minutes. - He seems to be very nice. - Are you naive. He saw a nice car that means a lot of money. And now he thinks about what can spring out for him. You are so pessimistic. You always think all men want to cheat on you. Here we are. That is a paradise. An unlikely expensive paradise. Welcome home, madame. Adida, please make sure that the staff does not bother me. - I need some peace and quiet. - As you wish, Madame. Throw that away, Adida. - But that's the picture of... - Adida! My husband is dead and this is my house now. - Throw it away! - Immediately, Madame. - This house looks like a mausoleum. A depressing atmosphere. Get some upholstery. Some carpets. Bring color in. Pictures, plants, flowers. - As you wish, Madame. - Then start right away, Adidia, go ahead! What's wrong, Emmanuelle? You look so sad. - Is it the man you lost? - Which man? - Your husband, of course. - no. - The sun is not warm. - You are crazy. It is very hot. I go swimming a bit. What about you? I'm not hungry, Emmanuelle. I can not stand this house. I'm getting on my nerves. - It's so sad here. - In a few days, everything will be different. - Come here to me, darling. - Can we still go out today? - Naturally. - We can go dancing. - Oh, yes, gladly. When I think that when I was a child I hardly had any water to drink. Well, it was my husband who gave me the first glass of champagne. That's the best memory I have about him, because it means the end of poverty. - Hello. - Oh, my dream girl. - I'm surprised to see you here. - Really why? - They were not a type of nightclub for me. - Really? I do not know why you got the idea, but you are wrong. I like to dance. Apart from that there is no other shop here, where the music is so good. - This is true. The music is great here. - I want to dance with you. - Okay. - Do we want to dance? - no. - Oh come you. - No thanks. Not so tired. Come on, we dance. What's happening? Do you have a wooden leg? - I said, no thanks. - Come on, let's go to the bar... - No, let me go! - Come, now do not be so bitchy. - Come. - Hey! It is better, you leave the lady satisfied. - Yes, I'm probably listening, right? - Hiss off and drink a coke. I think I have to thank you. I would have done the same for any woman in this situation. But I'm not every woman. You really want to stand above all others, right? Well, somehow you are definitely different than other people. And what about you? Are you different too? Let's put it this way. Every human being is a different person. Right? It's enough for today. We go. - What are you doing, Emmanuelle? - I'm laying a puzzle. When it's done, it's a beautiful girl. Can not we do it together? - No. - What do you mean with no? I want to do it myself. Leave me alone now, please. I would have done the same for any woman in this situation. But I'm not every woman. Well, somehow you are definitely different than other people. If you did not always play that self-confidence. I do not need to play this. I am so. I am so. I am so. I am so. The horses are the only thing that interests me here. I hope you have taken care of them in the past few months. - With the utmost care, Madame. - How many horses are here? - 52. - Oh, those are many. - For me there is only one horse here. - Nembis. - He is in the best shape, as you will see for yourself. Adida, do you have the files with the pedigrees? No, I'm sorry, madam. I did not know you needed it today. Which mares were last covered? After the details, we would have to ask the disciplinarian. But I think it's going well, Madame. We have a reputation for having the best horse breeding in this part of the world. And here we have the champion, Nembis. Hello, my little one. He is gorgeous. He is certainly the most beautiful horse in the world. - Adida, get me some sugar. - Immediately, Madame. - What breed is he? - Arabs. - He is really beautiful. Yes, he is the best of all, and once I leave here, then I will take him with me. - Oh, where? Everywhere. Let's go. Look at that. A stallion with his wife. She is forced to submit, whether she likes it or not. And that's the same with us. We women are dependent on the man. We are his toy. Our illusions are shattering. And only with good luck, and that's the only hope we women have, he will not survive his diabolical excesses. - That's awful, what you're saying. - It's the truth. If you see a happy couple together, it's just an illusion. A show for the public. Their reality looks completely different. - Shall we go? - Yes sure. Go through that again. There are still some mistakes in it. - Madame, your lawyer is here if you want to see him? - Thank you, Adida. - Should I accompany you today? - No, not today, darling. I have a date for lunch. Only boring business. Okay, then maybe I'll go to the sea. Good, but be careful. Do not swim that far. - Can you hear it? - Listen? What should I hear? - Listen. - I only hear wind. - You can hear more. It sounds like a scream, like whining. Like a lament. This was a theater a few thousand years ago. In the middle of the desert? - Can you imagine what was played here? - no. Here, in front of a large audience, women were executed who had committed adultery. - And this whining? - It is believed that it is the soul of a young married girl who was innocently executed. Today it serves as a sanctuary for the Bedouin women, who want to escape the torments of their husbands. This is a terrible place here. Come on, let's go. - That makes me completely broken here. - Yes, come. If you want, you can sleep with me now. Why are you saying that, Carol? - Listen, Robbie. Do we want to arrange something? - Yes, what? - No questions. - Yes, good. In order. Robbie, there is something I want to know. Do you mind if I ask you one last question? No questions, no answers. OK? - You're right. - Anyway, I'll find out anyway what I want to know, but in my own way and that's how I'm going to start. - Hey, do not talk nonsense. - That's not nonsense. I'm serious. But then you have to get me first. - Where have you been? - Down on the beach. I went down to the beach, but you were not there. You were with this American, right? - No. - Of course you were. - Come to the bathroom. - no. So what. You little liar. I know you were with him. And I know what you did together. Now kiss me. Come on! Did you enjoy fucking, right? You are a bad liar. You little whore. Wash his stink from your skin. Come on, go on! Did you enjoy it? It was fun for both of you, was not it? You are not clean enough. Come on, down with you! Leave him free for the finish. Good luck. - What brings you here? - Same as you, Miss Levis. I did not know you own a racehorse. That's just one of my diverse talents. It's just unfortunate that you can not do the most important thing. - I'm curious. - Make love. - Make love? That is smooth provocation. - It was not meant like that. I just talked about a fact. Good luck. Ladies and Gentlemen, 30 seconds to go this year's race for the Golden Cup. - We have to win today. The others have no chance. This is the sign for rider and horse to go into the starting box. Now they are all in their boxes. - That was the start. - Come on, Charlie, go! A clean start. The pace is very sharp. Charlie is in front, followed directly by Striker, Winford and Nimbus. Freywills Jermaine is behind the field. He had a bad start. The field is now diverging. Still Charlie in the lead. Head to head for second place are Striker and Winford. Then a half-length back and third position, the high favorite nimbus. So it goes into the first corner. Charlie is still in first position. But now followed by Winford at two. Striker falls further back. The favorite Nimbus is clearly in third position. So it goes on the home stretch. The positions are unchanged, but close Nimbus keeps going up to Winford. Charlie is still half a league from the field. Now Nimbus is running his race. He passes Winford and close to Charlie. It looks like an exciting finish. Charlie is only half a meter short of Nimbus. That's how it goes to the finish line. Nimbus gets the reins, he gets the last strength out of the flanks. It looks like he can do it. Yes, he passed Charlie. He did it! First Nimbus. Second Charlie. Third Winford. And fourth Striker. Already lost again. A remarkable result for Charlie. In his first race as a three-year-old in a first-class field, he finished second. You will be able to expect a lot from this galopper in the future. - Continue to be successful. - Many Thanks. It was a neck-and-neck race, what do you think of Charlie? Nimbus has won, and that's the most important thing. Yes, he ran very well, but you have to admit he was lucky. Charlie almost hit him. Compliment, Miss Levis. It may sound weird to you, but I'm glad you won. They always seem to have lost in your life. Always pretty overbearing. You should have your ego cured as soon as possible. I'm sorry, I said so, that's how I am. In any case, Charlie wins the next fight. You really have the gift to fantasize. I buy your charlie. I'll pay you a good price. Because I can afford to have a loser. - Why do you think I sell him? - Everything has it's price. Visit me and we can talk about it. Did you hear these journalists? The nerves have. Lucky to win, as if there had been luck in the game. But that's no reason to get so worked up. I do not understand much about the horse race, but Charlie did well. And I also thought that Nimbus was lucky. You naive, stupid bitch. If you do not understand it, shut up! Oh, what's wrong with you, Emmanuelle? What was in you? You have no right to talk to me like that. Are you still angry about Robert? I have not seen him since. You've changed since you've been with that bastard. - He's always buzzing around in your head. - Is not true, and stop this talk, that all men are shit, just because you've had stupid experiences. You're so naive, Carol, that I'm feeling sick. Let me have my experiences and do not worry about it. But I will always believe, next time it will be better. Better. If you behave like a hussy, you will be treated like a hussy. And you behave like a hussy. Some guy smiles at you and you spread your legs. What? Do you know who you are talking to? If I'm a hussy, what do you actually think you are? You sanctimonious bitch. You make me sick. You really go too far. I'm leaving with the next plane flying tomorrow! Then it is better, you get out and walk on foot. The fresh air will do you good. - See you later, Darling. - Get lost! God, we are absolutely broke. Just because this nimbus has beaten him in the finish by a few millimeters. Do you know what I believe? I think Nimbus was doped or something? Stop it. You know: A real man loses with dignity. And you two behave like hysterical old maids. Hey, look. Stop! - See you later. - We are waiting for you in the city. - Okay. Do you always park here like this, or do you want to free him up again? - Very funny. - You'll never get him out like this. - I can still walk. - To prove your independence. Do not be so stubborn. - Look at that. - What? - The sunset. I do not like that. I do not like watching when something dies. A well-known poet once compared the sunset with eternity. Eternity, he says, is the moment when the sun sinks into the sea. - Well, this is the desert. - A desert sea. It's the same. Mysterious, mysterious, timeless. The lap of nature. Well, I can imagine a better comparison for a sunset. - To love each other. - That's the same thing. There is no difference between love and eternity. How can you say that love and eternity are the same? These are two completely different things. You are too cynical. What is your problem, Emmanuelle? - I am a realist in life. - Aha, you and the maid of Orleans. So, here I get out. It was my pleasure. Many thanks for your help. Will you ever come over Charlie? I did not forget it. But do not get stuck in the sand again. Carol! Carol! - Oh hello. - Good evening. Do you know where Carol is? She has not come back yet. She drove into town for shopping. - You can wait if you want. - I do not want to bother you. Do not be crazy, Robert. They are not a nuisance. It takes a while, right? - Do you love Carol, Robert? - love? - Yes. - No, it's fun. - Oh, Robert. They still seem very inexperienced to me. Then give me some of your experience. What does love mean? To love is to give a tenderness at the right moment. And the opportunity to have sex with someone without complications. No, loving is the ability to communicate with each other. You want to chat? No, what I mean is: communication is much more important than pure sexuality. But sex is a form of communication. And you do not need confusing dialogues. When naked together, it is the most direct way of communication. Words only complicate and make simple relationships unmanageable. - I start to believe that you are right. - I know, I'm right. I have never been right as now. Carol, I thought you were a bit smarter. Come over and I'll pay you what I owe you, okay? Yes, if you would prefer that. So then in the bank tomorrow morning. Oh no, do what you want. I will definitely find a new one very quickly. Ciao. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. You are up very early. - I have a long journey ahead of me. - Oh, so you're running away? Two women at once scare you, huh? I planned this trip a long time ago. - I go to El Guler in the Sahara. - Then you should hurry, darling. - Where is Carol? - She packed her bags and left, when we were two in bed. - Good luck, Emmanuelle. So that's it, you go away and the game is over. Not for me. I start today with a new game. - Very humid air tonight. - Why do not we go in? Okay, let's go. As I said, I decided to do something completely new. - I will change my whole life. - You can be lucky. You can do what you want, how you want it and where you want it. - I can not do this. - Yes I am sure. Wealth can be a fetter. It is a bearable bondage. You also have some advantages. Emmanuelle, I would like to make you an offer for Nimbus. - Do you want to sell it to me or not? - Do you think I'm crazy? I know very well the motives of your visit. They are attentive and very friendly. And you make a lot of compliments, a little too much. But you do not put a lot of dust in my eyes. Do you really think your smile could fool you over your tricks? I know such men as you. You can not bluff me. Why react so jammed? Are you afraid of me? No. I'm not afraid of anyone, Peter. Listen, Emmanuelle, you can read in them like in a book. I understand. They were snooping in my past. But only the present is important. And I do not owe anyone an answer. Because I am rich now and have power. That sounds like a personal achievement to you. That, when you achieve something that is the result of your own hard work. It is only a consequence of fate. An absolute stroke of luck. Yes, but happiness comes only to those who deserve it. If you think so. Anyway. - Do you sell Nimbus? - I do not sell things, I buy them. - And sometimes I play for her. - Why not? - How many cards do you want? - Two. Three for me. - Shall we raise? - Well, how could I? I only have this one horse. Ten strokes with the whip. - Twenty. Thirty. See. A stupid way to play. I prefer to play for money. You are afraid to pay, right? Madame. Madame, a young girl and two men are waiting outside. I will go now and leave you to your guests. We'll talk another time. What is that melody? An old hash song from India. Since you can leave right. Come on, kiss her. Now undress, I want to see you naked. And now love you. I want to see everything. You are doing that beautifully. Let her come. Hey, why are you looking so sad through the world? The day is way too nice to sit here alone. Come with us. Come on. Come on. - We've been waiting for you, Peter. - Well, now I am here. - And how are the shops going? - Damn bad. - Broke. - There is money in the south if you want. - Well, you have to drive without me. You're not exactly what you call a buddy. I mean, who the hell got you into the business, Peter? Already forgotten? Oh, let's not talk about it, it's not that important. - It was stupid of me to ask you at all. - Come with me, Peter. Can not come. Do it well. I did not think you would come again. Why are you here? I wanted to say goodbye and also give you a present. - What do you mean by gift, Peter? - Well, a present. A present. Charlie. They make fun of me. Or do you really give it to me? - How so? - Two reasons. All your life you have only demanded something. And you had to fight very hard for everything. Nobody ever gave anything to you. I want to give you something and show you what giving means. It's strange that you know this song. - It reminds me of my first kiss. - I understand what you mean. It's one of those memories that makes you the past like a fairy tale Keep playing, it's beautiful. Sometimes I wish I could turn back time. But it always stays the now. Do you remember how you showed me the sunset? - For sure. - And you mentioned the lines of this poet. - Eternity. - That scared me. Because it's right what you said. It is eternity. An act of love. - And you are afraid of love? - Yes. During a love act, a part of you dies and is lost forever. I'm afraid of that. Yes you are right. But it happens more than that. What we lose is replaced. Through the ability to give. I want to die a bit. Giving you something. Let's drop the masks. For a moment. - For this moment. - The eternity of the moment. Peter!
