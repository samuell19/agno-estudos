[groaning] [rats squeaking] [man] All right, let's go. Move it! Come on, move, man. Move. Let's go. Pick up your positions. Anderson, on that tree line. [man] Come on, we gotta get these... [man] Go! [indistinct shouting] [man] Move out! [man] Nicky, I got a letter from your mother. All right, boys, let's do it. We don't got all day. Welcome home. Ain't Buckingham Palace, but looks like something. Roof, bed to sleep on. Garraty, how the fuck are ya? Ladies and gentlemen, this is Garraty. Don't feed him. He fuckin' bites. Find a bed. Unpack your kit. Yeah. Hey, hey, welcome, welcome. Bunch of fucking clowns. Gentlemen, we chow at 1700 hours. That's it. That's my bit. The illustrious Lieutenant Hollowborn. Sir. Men, I'm Lieutenant Hollowborn . I don't give a fuck what you did before. There's no dope smoking in this platoon. You settle in, get some chow, get some rest. We open our first tunnel tomorrow. You have any problems, talk to Sergeant Heaney. Or me, or whatever. First tunnel tomorrow? Great. Three months off the boat and I'm already in this hellhole. That's my stuff. - What's your name, white bread? - Miller. It's early to get your ass whipped. Fuck this shit. [man] Uh, you're on my bunk. - Yeah. You wanna trade? - No. Goddamn it. [rock plays on radio] You look in the Bible at the Battle of Jericho. Joshua is ordered by Yahweh to slay every man, woman, child, cattle and slave of his enemy. That's how you win a fucking war. You want the prisoner hung? That fucking gook murdered five of my men. I want him hung. I understand, lieutenant, but he's still a soldier. He's not a soldier. He's not in uniform. I want him hung. Yes, sir. Corporal. [Hollowborn] Platoon, form up. Witness the execution. [man] You heard him. [Hollowborn] Let's go. Let's go. [man shouting] [Heaney] This man is a VC sniper. He's killed at least five of our brothers. We show no mercy. We take no prisoners. - [cracking] - [laughter] [man] Best gook's a dead gook. [man 2] They're sick. - They're sick. - Garraty, cut him down. [Garraty] All right. Where I come from, that's murder. You got a problem with the Army, or with me, asshole? I believe I've got a problem with you, sir. Good. [man] You one of the new guys? How long you been here? A while. - Heard about the tunnels? - Yeah. - Ever been in one? - A few. Well, shit. Welcome to the camp. - Porterson. - Johnson. [Porterson] All right. Thanks. Johnson, right? Miller. Bob Miller. And you are...? - Porterson. - Porterson. Right. Man, I just cannot get used to this food. My mom's the best cook. Her brisket is out of this world. Every Friday night, we have the best Shabbat dinner. Me, her, the entire neighborhood. I can't wait to get back. She's sick, my mom. Every week I'm away, it breaks her heart more and more. If I lose her before I get back... - Gary, right? - Yeah. Miller. People like Miller got no business being here. - I know. - Blabbermouths. Nothing they say is ever worth hearing. Talking too much out here can get you hurt, get other people killed. Take a look at them, for example. Battle-hardened vets, they come in, eat their chow and leave. Then you got enlisted types who think this is a fucking game. Then there's guys like Miller. Future KIA. Someone who talks a lot because he's scared shitless to be here. Well, I hope this makes you feel better. [grunting] You wanna play God, you son of a bitch? Is that what you wanna do, play God? Ah! It ain't about God or the devil, Harris. It's about survival. All right. [grunting] Charlie's gonna kill you just for fucking being here. He doesn't care if you're a nice guy. [groaning] [indistinct chatter] Same old shit. Verano, come here. - Sarge? - What's wrong with the food? Just tastes bad, sergeant. I know. Where you from? - Michigan. - Yeah? My wife's folks have a place in Charlevoix. Know where that is? - Yeah. Really? - It's around the lake. It's beautiful. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah. You ever get scared out there? Let me tell you the only thing you need to know. This place is all about survival. It's not black and white. It's all grey. The sooner you realize that, the better chance you've got of packing your shit together one day and doing that duffle bag drag back to the world. - Understand? - Yeah. All right. Now finish your meal. [man] Over here. Over here. [indistinct chatter] [soft rock plays] - All right, going for three? - Going for three. You beat me twice. I think you're trying to hustle me, boy. - Show me the queen. - Here we go. - The queen, you got it? - Got it. Look at this beautiful black queen. - Lookin' at her? - Yeah. Keep your eye on her, boy. Come on. You ready? Where's she at? You got her, right? Keep your eyes open, boy. All you've gotta think about is that beautiful, black, - thick queen. Where's she at? - She's right there. - You sure? - Positive. - Damn, boy. Look at that. - [both laugh] You're getting hustled, Verano. Stop corrupting Terence. Nobody's corrupting. Am I corrupting you? - No. - Trying to learn something. - OK. - Damn this thing. Big, heavy ass. Come on, split six. - Six? - Yep. Come on. - You ready? - I'm ready. Let's go. Where you at, boy? - Where's she at? - She's right there. - You sure? - I'm positive. Uh-oh. Shame, boy. Come on, pay up. - Big fucking surprise. - All good. You'll win next time. Better save your cigarettes, Terence. [Lidford] Ain't got nothing to do with you. What you reading over there, man? Romans, Chapter 11. Romans, Chapter 11. You hear that? Got a southern belle out here. Flip that on to Jeremiah 29:11. - Oh, yeah? - Uh-huh. - Where'd you find this? - Chicago. - What you know about the Bible? - I'm about to learn you. Yeah, OK. "'For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,' said the Lord, 'Thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me...'" "'Then shall you call upon me and I will listen, and I will call you from the nations from which you were banished, and I will bring you out of the exile - in which I carried you.'" - That's right. [laughs] What the hell's that supposed to mean? Tell him what it mean, Harris. If you have faith, God will save you from this horrible shit. - Mm-hm. - You got faith? - Yeah, I do. - God's gonna save you from this shit? - I believe that. - Well, that's good. Because while men are cutting off other men's heads for trophies and hanging ears around their neck, it's good to know that Harris is going to be saved. - This isn't the end, man. - This is the end. Ain't nobody trying to hear that jive-ass shit. - You're fucking up my high. - That book is a high. - Here we go. - That book's a high. Got men believing they're gonna get swept out of here. Shut the fuck up. How about that? Got to you, huh? - I'll kick your ass, man. - Don't you fucking touch me! - Yeah. - Do something, nigga. - You fucking hoodies. - Go take a shower, bitch. Yeah. Come on, boy. Come on. Put your money up, boy. Show me the queen. - Ready? - I'm ready. [man] Fucking small-minded, ghetto hoodies. Fantasy land. - What's your name? Gil... - Graybridge. Graybridge. Where you from, Graybridge? Let me ask you a question. Do you believe in God? I believe in God. Let me ask you a question. When was the last time Red Sox won the Series? I don't know. Fifty-some years ago, I guess. That answer your question? I tell you what. A greater franchise has never existed. This is our year. - Year. Year of the franchise. - What the fuck are you smoking? - No, listen. You like burgers? - Everybody likes burgers. Right, everybody likes burgers, but check it out. In California, this guy started up a franchise. That's the magic word. Burgers, fries, shakes, speed, like that. You just find a plot of land, he fronts the dough. It's easy as pie. It's the American dream. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which American dream? This fucking American dream? I don't know, man. This don't seem like no dream to me. No, you're missing it. I'm talking about when I get back. I'm gonna be my own boss. I'm gonna be an entrepreneur. - I'm gonna... - You're gonna... Me too, Graybridge. Me too. I'm gonna... I'm gonna get a girl. I'm gonna get a boat. I'm gonna get a little house on Lake Winnipesaukee. It's gonna be fucking great. I'm serious. But meantime, this is what we've got right here. Right fucking here. There's a forest full of chinky-eyed motherfuckers, and they got their vision of the gook dream, whatever that is. They'll slit your fucking throat to get it. - You're missing it... - Oh yeah? Tell me. Burger joints. They're the wave of the future. That sounds good. How about some fucking water? Yeah. Sure. Fucking war. What the fuck, man?! Did you piss in this? - Nah, nah. - Fuck! Thank you. You're a real winner. [Lidford] This is serious shit, boy, all right? Pay attention. There's power to the way a man smokes a cigarette, all right? - Right-handed? - Yeah. All right. Relax your shoulders. Look forward. Inhale. - [coughing] Shit! - You all right? Heading to the tunnels tomorrow. I wouldn't be smoking. The VC don't give a damn about no cigarette smoke. When you're underground in a confined space, the VC can smell anything on you: Your aftershave, cigarette smoke in your uniform. They can even tell what brand. If that happens, you're as good as dead. Bullshit, Johnson. Bullshit, all right? My mom would kill me if she saw me doing this. I wouldn't worry about your mom killing you tomorrow, Verano. My parents have a house on Lake Michigan. And at night, me and my sister, we'd sneak out and go down to the beach. We'd run up the sand dune and lay there and look at the stars. We'd talk about all kinds of shit. She'd talk about girl stuff and I'd talk about baseball. We'd spend hours up there. I remember one time... [laughs] ...we fell asleep up there and we got in so much trouble. I woke up to my fucking dog licking me in my face. I don't know, man. I'd do anything to see my family right now. My sister and my dog and my parents. What about your folks? It must have been pretty tough on you, your mom and your dad. You don't know shit about my mom and my dad. Sorry. Why you asking all these stupid-ass questions, anyway? - Get the fuck off my bunk, man. - I didn't mean anything. Sorry. [Porterson] None of that shit matters. Where you've been, where you're from. Right now you're in Vietnam. It matters what you do on that field. Oh, shit. Got a blow a kiss to my girl. Oh, yeah. The moon is nice and bright out there. - Who you out there kissing? - Oh, it's a concept me and my girl came up with: the satellite of love. I send a kiss up every night and she takes one down from the moon. - It's nice. - Yeah. Let me ask you something. What happened with you and Hollowborn today? We had to talk a couple things out. - Did you get to say anything? - Not much. Yeah, maybe next time you'll keep your mouth shut, huh? Hero. John Wayne. Thanks for the headset, Verano. Oh, man! Would you eat here? [laughs] Yeah, it looks good. Hey. Thanks. [indistinct chatter] [Harris] I heard about these tunnels. I had an uncle who died here last year. Your uncle obviously didn't have an M-60. They say they stretch for hundreds of miles. No one knows where they start or where they end. This is a really bad place to be. - This is it. You ready? - I was born ready. - You nervous? - Not at all. Just follow my lead. - You got it. - [imitating] You got it. You just love following the white man, don't you, boy? Saddle up, motherfuckers. We're moving out. - Corporal Green, take point. - Yes, sir. Garraty, get that 60, in front of me. Johnson, bring up the rear. Let's go. Fall in. [Hollowborn] RTO, you do not leave my side. Let's go. Let's go. [man] Right away. [whistles] Check it out, man. - Heaney. - Yes, sir. Secure the perimeter. Verano, Lidford, Green, give me a perimeter. We found this tunnel before sundown, and I'm not clearing a tunnel at night. OK, this is what it's all about. I'm using a stick, whereas a knife might set off a trap. And these holes are full of them. Volunteers. - Got it, sir. - I'll go first. Garraty, Johnson, Porterson. I ain't got a lot of cock, but I've got a lot of balls. Harris, take the 60. - Fucking John Wayne. - Fucking A. Hey, Garraty, five bucks for a dead gook. All right. Later, fuckers. - [gunshot] - Shit. - What the fuck, man? - I'll get him. Watch your fucking six. [gasping] [gunshot] [man] Shot in the stomach! Coming up! Porterson, give me a hand. [gasping] I need another compress! [gasping] [Porterson] I'm right here. I gotcha. I gotcha. You hold on, man. Garraty, look at me. Look at me. I'm right here. You're going to make it. Just hang in there. You're going to make it. Hold on. Garraty? Look at me. Look at me. - Shit! - Clear him. Porterson, give me grenades. - Give me grenades. - Yes, sir. [Hollowborn] Blow it. Blow it and get the fuck out of there! [man] Come on! [Hollowborn] Come on! - Come on! - Get him out! [man] Get the fuck out! [man] Eyes on that treeline. How many VC did you see down there? I saw two VC, lieutenant. All right, get some CS gas down there. Harris? I'm gonna take Garraty back to base camp. Heaney. I want them to gather as much intel as is left. Dave, Bob, you're going with me. Yes, Sir. Miller, leave the radio with me. [man] Still on that treeline. [Hollowborn] Come on, let's get him up. - [man] Porterson, you ready? - Ready. [Porterson] We've got one! Got one VC coming up! - Got him? - Coming up. Over here. - His fucking leg. - Grab it. - [Porterson] Got another one. - [man] Got another one. Lidford, give me a knife and a flashlight. We're going back down. - [man] Hook it up. - [man #2] I got it. - [man] All set. - [man #2] Back down. [man] Let's get this hooked up. - The radio's on. - Here you go. Keep your eyes peeled. [metal scraping] [panting] It's a dead end. There's nothing down here. [speaking Vietnamese] [panting] [Johnson] I'm gonna go up and check the surrounding area, see if I can find Sergeant Heaney, let him know this section's clear. Cover the rear. Right behind you. [gagging] [Porterson] Johnson! Johnson! Johnson! [gagging] [panting] Alpha Bravo, come in. Over. Check the tension. - It's loose. - Shit! Harris, Lidford, stay here in case they come back. Green, Verano, come with me. We're gonna check that out. Yes, sir. [vomiting] - Jesus Christ. - Fucking Christ. We need to get to Harris and Lidford. - What about Porterson? - We're gonna leave him here? We'll come back. We need to get back. What about Porterson? [grunting] [coughing] [grunts] What the fuck, man? Where the fuck is everybody else? - Johnson's dead. - What the fuck you mean he's dead? What you think he means he's dead? He's got a fucking hole in the neck the size of a baseball - and blood coming out his eyes! - Hey! - Calm the fuck down. - We get the picture. - What about Porterson? - We didn't see him. - What now? - Harris, get on the radio. Try to get a hold of the lieutenant. Lidford, I need you to cover him. Verano, you also. Corporal, stay. I'm going in. - I'm going with you. - Sure about that? Fuck that. Fuck "Corporal, stay here." Charlie Six to Alpha One, over. We're sitting fucking ducks for Charlie right now. I think you understand that, sergeant. Yes, I do. Charlie Six to Alpha One, over. - Fuck this! - Come on! [Harris] Charlie Six to Alpha One, over. [Green] We're supposed to stick around like a bunch of ducks waiting for Charlie to come to us? Fuck that. [Heaney] Hold tight. Hold tight. [Green] Good luck, fuckers. - [Lidford] Get that working. - I'm trying. Get that shit working! Make the fucking shit work! Make the shit work! Make it work! That's not gonna help, OK? It's dead, man. It's dead. Shh. What's wrong? The tunnel splits in two different directions. We need to split up. Porterson is down here someplace, If we don't find him, someone else will. We need to split up. We stay together, and stay quiet. [speaking Vietnamese] [panting] [crashing] Ah! - Sarge? Oh, my God! - [Green] Heaney. - [Verano] Oh, my God! - Fuck. - Sarge? Oh, my God. [sobbing] - Sarge? [Verano] I wanna go home! Oh, fuck. [sobbing] Oh, fuck! - Get away from the hole. - I'm not fucking leaving him! - Look at me, sarge. - Get the fuck away from the hole. Fuck, fuck, fuck! - [gunshots] - [screaming] - How long have they been gone? - Way too long. Way too long. Just keep some cover, all right? Keep your eyes open. Shh. You hear that? Over there. They're coming. [gunfire] Lidford, get in the hole! Motherfuckers, come on! Come on, motherfuckers! Fuck you! Come on, piece of shit. Fuck you! Ah! Shit! Come on, get your ass down now! [Harris] Let's go! [speaking Vietnamese] [screaming] I've been here over a year now, and I can't get used to it. - How many deaths have you seen? - I don't want to talk about that. I don't want to talk about that. Where are you from? - Do you have any family? - You're cool with me. I don't want to talk about that. [gunfire] Come on, Graybridge! - Stay there! - What the fuck is going on? Ah! Ah! [Green] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Porterson? It's Harris. Harris? - Oh, fuck. - Green. Green. it's OK. We took heavy fire up top. Lidford's been shot. He's losing blood. We've gotta get his ass out of here now. There are VC all over us down this way. - [gasping] - Green, where's your team? - Ah! - Is that too tight? - [groaning] - Green, where's your team? I'm gonna fucking die out here, man. I'm gonna die in this fucking hole. Hey. Don't get stupid on me. You're not gonna die. We're going this way. Get your shit together. Let's go. Ah! [screaming] Fuck. Lidford! Put your head down! Fuck! Jim, put your fucking head down! Fuck! Jim? [screaming] Ah! Oh! [shouts] [panting, straining] Keep moving. What are you doing? - I'm done. - What? I ain't going no more, Harris. Put that cigarette out. Those commie gook motherfuckers want me, I'm gonna be here, but I'm not moving another foot in this goddamn tunnel! Shut your damn mouth! Shut up! I'm not going anywhere!
