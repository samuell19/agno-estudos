FIDELITY That better? I'm wary of your chats in the dark. - Did I often? - No, I was never there. Did I bother you with my principles? No. I just wanted to say I'm proud of you. - Thank you. - No, I thank you. For letting me see Paris again. And I was so happy to go to London where your dad and I had our greatest hits. I'd forgotten what it was like. And rest assured, I won't be in your hair much longer. What's up, Mom? I've always let you live your life. What's the matter? - And we're friends. - Yes... - That's rare. - Maybe... Are you in pain? I'm okay. So, can I needle you a little? - For once? - Go ahead. I just wanted to see you with someone decent before I... I've never loved anyone, Mom. Who mentioned love? I never loved your father yet you're here and I'm so happy. - Don't need to marry to be happy. - We married on a liner. Yes, I know. You know, that man, who's paying you... - Your boss, I mean. - Mac Roi. Lucien Mac Roi. I sort of knew him... way back. I didn't know. Isn't he Australian, or South American or something? Canadian. How did you meet him? We met in Paris, and then... he came to Canada when your dad and I were on tour, before you were born. But... But you had your principles. Back then life was lovelier the sun warmer than today Back then we needed nothing... And I was married. When you were born... I should've left. - Now I understand. - What? Why they hired me. No, I'd not do that. I never saw him again. They hired you as you're the best. You see, Cl?lia, in my principles - there's one key word. - Which is? Honour. That is how we are... Our kisses follow from afar... like suns of old... Both your albums are very beautiful. What's odd is your choice of subject. - An album on absence... - Odd? Yes, empty streets, deserted landscapes. When people do figure we never see them clearly. And your latest which created such a stir. Haute-couture, fashion, catwalks, backstage, and not a single model's face. Nor a designer's... Why? - Why what? - Why so cold, impersonal? - Very personal. - Sure, they're yours... I'd say objective. Now other photographers are copying your headless models. True, we'd seen too much of them. Nice working girls, like me. - Paid millions. - I don't pay them. With just two albums you're now a star? Christ, she's beautiful. I just take photos. Static, lifeless things. Yet you make a good living from it. I hear you're being hired by a Canadian group, new to France but already making waves in the popular press. I'm on a two-week trial, I'm photographing a wedding - and... flowers! - Very chic! Not necessarily. I saw the prettiest flowers in England. And a flower can be totally shameless. Yet as you know, the Mac Roi group tabloids are the most scandalous. Obscenity sells. They hunt people down, destroy them. Not if they've nothing to hide. And the paparazzi, what do you think of them? - They have to eat. - And if you had to... I've been luckier, I'm free to choose. I've never known misery, only seen it. Which doesn't mean I'm happy, just... Yes? Serene. Thank you. Shit, I gotta go! - You were extra! - As in extra terrestrial? Selena, darling, make me two cassettes. Mr Mac Roi will be so happy. In fact, he wants to meet you. - It's time you joined the fold. - Never. The other's for Diane, she'll love the paparazzi bit. I called the hotel, your mother's sleeping. Your equipment's been cleared, it's waiting. I'll take your albums, don't worry about a thing. Thank you. Like to go eat? - At the museum? - To walk, alone. - How pretty! - Yes, they're... Think I could photograph it in the window? That's not done, Miss. It's a special order, already paid for... Doesn't bother me in the least! I even find it... - Flattering. - Can you put it there? Thank you. It's beautiful! And sad! Is it for a funeral? No, it's for an engagement. Oh, I'm sorry. But you're right, must be Freudian. It doesn't really express... No. Thanks anyway. My name's Cl?ve, I'm a publisher. I work just over there. Cl?lia. Cl?lia, Cl?ve... CI. Close... Are you English? You've no accent. No, Canadian. Whales, writers, forests... Quaint expressions... like to see where I work? My ramshackle house, my brothers, my father. A house with a glorious past and a shakier future. So I thought that by marrying... someone rich, of the opposite sex... Because I love children, I want to have lots of kids... So gentle... I wasn't too ridiculous? No. Charming. You don't happen to find me slightly absurd? Yes, but I like that. There. Do you often...? No, not often. Good, I'm very glad to hear that. Because I do a lot of children's books and morals are very important. Goodbye. I'll see you again? - Didn't dare enter, I heard voices. - Your vocation. Cl?lia! Bernard, my brother. My pleasure. This way out. - Cl?ve, Father's waiting. - Knew I was late. - I'm often late. - Cl?ve's always late. Bernard's a bishop, talks nonsense. They're so hard up they're making bishops of anyone and everyone! - Antoine has arrived. - He's the eldest. Teaches at the Sorbonne. If father dies, he'll take over. Bernard will be an archbishop, a cardinal, Pope! - And you'll not change. - It's why I'm so endearing. My father, my brother. Told you you'd meet them all. We lunch together once a week. It's an old bourgeois tradition. Like to join us? How silly of me! No women allowed at the club. Right, Antoine? Bernard? It was really sweet. Goodbye. - What does she mean, "sweet"? - Me. I think you're there. "A beauty didst appear at court". Sorry? Football. Ex world champions. Holding on in there. An international addiction. Zinedine Zidane... I do the sports page. Nice to meet you. Here, it's sport and sex... And scandal! All is scandal. We live off it. Diane... You're Cl?lia? Mr Mac Roi wants our image to be more distinguished. - Is that the word? - How should I know? Cl?lia is here to make us more distinguished. But the clean phase is just a passing whim. We earn our keep on dirt. I've seen your photos. I hope you'll do better. Are you disciplined? Mr Mac Roi has just bought a third-rate hockey team. He's already a team in Canada. But he feels hockey isn't popular enough in France. Can you shoot a hockey match? Keeping in mind that it's a friendly and friendliness interests no one. It's your first "assignment". Can I photograph your hands? You don't like my hands? Every good photo is a nasty photo. It's your mother... You can go, Andr?. It was kind of you to stay... It's just... Mr Mac Roi... Got to earn a living, eh? My mobile... Call whenever you need me. Thanks. She's under sedation, but there's no point keeping her in. Without health cover, it'd be too costly. I feel she'd be much better at home with you. We'll have to organise home-care. She'll be having more of these attacks. All we can do is make sure she doesn't suffer. At all? - Is she brave? - Yes. What did she do? In life? She was a cabaret singer. - And your dad? - A tap-dance routine. I think you should go home. - Can I see her? - She's sleeping. Madam... Miss. I just wanted to say if you need anything... Thank you. As you're alone in Paris I wondered if... No. Come and get it! I'm ready and waiting! - Sorry, lady. - I'm with Saint-Andr?. I'm a pro. "Go girls, go Mac Roi! Next time we'll hang 'em high!" Can you do that again for me, please? Like you were, no hands! Let's go, turn! One more time! I saw your photos. I mean, I saw photos of you. - You'll stay? - Sorry? I thank you for accepting my offer. You'll stay? Come with me. - I'm working, for you. - Could do better. You could do better. You've got guts. - You smell of sweat. - I like that. I could be your daughter. So? Never stopped anyone. It did me. Think I'll publish your porn? Think our decent minded readers want to eye up cock over breakfast? - Yes. - You're fired. Only joking. I need you. Your image, my image. I like you. Me too. Come over to Julia's, it'll be very formal. Meet my daughter and her asshole fianc?... We'd arranged to, Sir. You'll see... We're people of worth. He spent three days and nights in the rhododendrons and nailed him screwing on the lawn! With infra-red! Their dog pissed on him! But boy did he piss on them! The presidency, bye, bye! I went to that florist's every day! I slept on the office couch thinking you'd... I didn't know where, but I knew we had to... Didn't stop you in your wedding plans? No, no... Honestly, it's not what you think. It's a family affair. Like I told you. My family being eminently reasonable, our business was going bankrupt... And as Bernard is homosexual and Antoine a misogynous bachelor... You decided to happily marry, into money. Because, I'm not really cut out for... For what? My father, a master of understatement calls it convenience... I love you! It's that simple! Crazy, but true... - I love her! - What did you say? I said, I loved her. Sorry, I'm so embarrassed. Geni?vre Mac Roi, my fianc?e, Cl?lia, Miss Cl?lia... It was nice while it lasted. Thank you. Are you okay? Geni?vre is the sister of Mr Mac Roi... Here's father. I'd like to toast a great man, Julien Cl?ve and his venerable publishing house... That's us. With whom we've had the honour... - because as you all know I come from nowhere - to sign a final agreement. - I should've done better. - And it is with pride that I add this jewel of French culture to my group. Thank you. Sure you're alright? Hello, Cl?lia. I'm Julia. I showed your photos to my father. Excuse me. Which of us is older? Me, I think. - Don't want to wed? - Never thought about it. - Are you in love? - No. Someone in your life? You've not had some impossible, romantic affair? A Freudian fling? Like everyone. I'm not like everyone. Neither am I. We'll be friends. David, - Cl?lia and I are to be friends. - Yes, darling. David's frail, was born in Jakarta. In Morocco. - Can I go see? - What? What's happening. Julien Cl?ve is dying, he can't be moved. He was too good for us. Julien, may this holy unction, by the grace of our lord and the Holy Spirit, comfort you, Amen. Oh heavenly Father, You who see all good faith and refuse not forgiveness to those who ask have mercy on Julien, your friend. We pray You with all our hearts, grant him peace in body and soul and the forgiveness he asks. Respect... At this hour when death casts doubt on life help us to be strong, oh lord, and give us Your promise of salvation. Don't leave me. And so before taking our leave let us gather our thoughts and pray. We commit our brother's body unto the earth and we ask You, oh lord, welcome him into the light. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. It's right nearby. Maybe we could walk? - He won't respect us. - Who? Mac Roi. He'll put one of his goons in charge to make money. - But he promised. - Like he always does, and then he massacres all that's upright and inefficient, delicate and noble... - And you can't... - No, my father sold. I'm just an employee, we're broke. But I still have the house. It's pretty. Antoine's standing down, Bernard's a monk. He's taking the Paris apartment, Antoine the artworks, what's left of them. Together, we could've sold and started anew, but with those two clowns... I love books. Can't write them, but I know how to love them. And I love you. And I thank you. For what? For being. Our mother. I didn't know he carried it on him... I need air... He'll respect you. My mom is ill. I took his job offer for her. But if he doesn't keep his word... What are we going to do? - What're you doing? - Waiting. - For what? - A decision. - They didn't print my contacts? - Sure did, full-size! They've no right! I choose! - Choose? No right? - I forbid them... The only thing forbidden here is beauty, and thus, good. Reading is resisting. Here we go! I had them enlarged to try to understand. But I must be stupid so perhaps you can explain... I smoke! I drink! I stink, my nails are black! But what is this? What do I do - with crap like this? - Print it! In a slag-mag! With tits full of... Silicone! Ass, blood, sex! And this, why is it blurred? Who are they? Who's hitting who? Blood from whose nose? Whose fist in whose face? Who cares? Fucking morons! Morons with money. Cash! Dough! Readies! At least one! Front page! - These are just bad! - You know it's not true. The real is photographed as it is. It takes that cruel science of man... As he is. I know. No, you know nothing. I've known Mac Roi for thirty years, and yet - it's still me he... - Yes? Lays, fucks, screws... shags, grinds... And this? With a head, it'd be a sensation. Headless, it's porn. So you should like it. - You just don't get it. - What? I'm the world and its woe. And I love him. I love Mac Roi. Print. You shut it. - You're fired. - Can't fire me, bitch. - I'm the best. - I am the best. I was with lucien's father at 15, the early days. He was old, but he had... balls! He asked me to take care of his son, to teach him... But you're drunk, and you're going to bed. I called you because... Because what? A blond, that's alright. But her and her... arty-farty... Print. This one. Front page, tomorrow. No, my place. I have to check on something. My diplomas? That's you bought, anyhow. Give me a minute? Please, make yourself at home. How do you feel? All fired up - and ready for hell. - You'll go to heaven. If heaven will have me. I brought you a friend. Will I buy... or have champagne sent up? - Not yet. Can you come? - As you like. Mom, it's Mr Mac Roi. Heck, I've no make up on. What must I look like? She sang under the name of Gis?le. Whose daughter am I, Mom? Don't ask me. Please... Don't ask me. How can I help? Stay... a little while. Careful, mind the step! There... There you go. No, don't like that at all. Just leave it there. Thank you, that'll be all. How fleeting it is... The cherry time... When we go hand in hand... To dreamily pick... Pendants for our ears... Young beauties will have... Folly in mind... And lovers... The sun in their hearts. - Thank you. - But it's only right. I kept my job thanks to Cl?lia. That's better. A little reading? Jesus or a crime thriller? That's for later. "Fidel Castro is dead" No loss! "Portfolio of the amazing Cl?lia" At least one masterpiece got through. Shitty printing! What a crap newspaper! See? Was that me? All over. What's up? - And socks too! - Yes, I always sleep with socks plus a night-shirt and bachelor's boxer shorts! It belonged to... What's her name again? Geni?vre. Your ex. No, it was my mother's. It's very pretty. And so are you. On one condition. That you never sleep in a night-shirt again. You neither. It's stuck. It's stuck, hold on... - Happy? - You bet! When's the big day? I need a witness, will you come? To get mad drunk, sure I'll come. "To be husband he'll not weary of being lover". Get a move on. - Where's your bottle? - Where else? You didn't manage to steal him? - See, I'm the best. - You're the best. - And you're not, Nemo is. - Who? Your opposite, an unschooled lout. A street-kid who did time, who Jean took a shine to, who I picked up on, trained, you know why? - Because he's that cruel science... - Of life. And because he fucks like a dream. - Everything that moves! - In the gutter. Second assignment, tomorrow... No, tomorrow I can't. You're paid to. I'm getting married. To a high-brow, I suppose. - None of your business. - It is. It's entirely my business. Change of assignment. - Photograph my hands. - Now? I too want to be in this "Paris Portfolio". Sorry... - You got it? - Yeah, I got it. Call Mac Roi! I saw you on a TV set. Didn't have time to talk to you, had to split... I haven't slept for 10 days. Smoked a lot... I saw your portfolio in the subway. It's yours, no? I think it sucks. Why do you say that? 'Cos everything sucks, and I wanna sleep with you. It's just incredible! How did he pull it off? Must never ask him that. Know what it is? - Saw it in Calcutta. - Only this is Marseilles! - Did you photograph it? - No. - He did. - Like them? They're nice photos. It should be his portfolio, not mine. This isn't an art-house. Run him a portfolio! - Cl?ve is happy? - I hope so. And are you happy, Miss Cl?lia? Yes. Then shut it! I'm still editor in chief here. That'll do. There's to be big changes here concerning all of you. Let's go, briefing! Wanna grab a bite? Shit, I forgot to wash. - You live here? - I got out as soon as I could. And before? Up north, but no work there. And before? Before? The DASS. What's that? A kennel for kids with no parents. Not very good, eh? One of those, a fritter... A fricassee, a pizza? A fricassee. Go ahead and sit down. Great, thanks. Nanou! Lots of hot sauce! Put your hands like that. Keep your eyes on me, okay? Further apart. Right, don't move. That's hot. Now, close. Keep looking at me. - Now open. - It worked! Iook! How did he do it? I'm a magician. Can you wipe my face? Security blanket. Decent guy? I have to go. What's he doing now? Now? Waiting for me. Everything alright? Goodnight. I was worried. No need to be. What's all this for? I'm not sure, I'm not very talented... You are. So first, we dine at your mother's by candlelight, before the... fateful day. Protect me. I will. Are you sure? Yes. I give you this ring, token of our love and our fidelity. Blessed art Thou lord of all creation. You who give us this bread, fruit of the earth and human hands, which we now offer unto You. It shall become the bread of life. Cleanse me of my trespasses, wash my soul of sin. I give you Mr and Mrs Cl?ve. - Did you tell him? - No, did you? What do you want I tell him? I wish you every happiness with this undeserving asshole! Bravo, you beat me at the post! - I wasn't running. - No, you can barely walk! - Getting violent? - Have I ever gotten violent? - Only one thing I respect. - Which is? The family. I will be. You're the talk of the town. But your success is maybe too Parisian for us lovers of outsiders even if pictures will never equal words! - Taking a honeymoon? - No, got my old business to run. Can't run anything with blinkers! You need new ideas! I never wear new shoes not having worn them! "He's not quite happy, he doesn't quite possess her." "Include me out"! Is that it? Enough of this! I want to stay with you always. Come for the weekend, you lovebirds seem totally at sea. In a world at sea, of adults. - I beg you. - Come, your mother's waiting. I'll see to it. Saint-Andr?! What my girls want, they'll have! - What're you doing? - And you? I'm leaving. I'll send a van round for my stuff. It's your apartment, but my life. You can have both. I'm sorry. You can stay the night. I'm not gonna... I can't. Bastard! My God! Put that on her bed. Not that... Not that! My poor dear... Once again, forgive me. My father did make one attempt to make money with the unfunny memoirs of a comic. A total disaster! We even ordered ajuicy photo for the cover. True confessions! The comic was into truck drivers and sailors. It was... a guy named after a submarine captain who took the picture. A specialist... Nemo. - Nemo, as in Jules Verne? - I'm cold. Let's have a drink, it's freezing out here. Normandy is heavenly, but... "One prize... "is beyond his reach. "The Ogre cannot master speech. "About a subjugated plain... "Among its desperate "and slain "The Ogre stalks "with hands on hips "While drivel... "While drivel gushes from his lips"... I don't know what will become of us. How long the good grace of the Ogre will last. Due to his soft spot for Cl?lia, which I increasingly cannot bear. Bringing out Auden's poems? Yes, I've a passion for Auden. He'd the genius of being... true. He was a miracle worker. At least I'll have been of some use. And after? If Cl?lia gets fired, and I'm sure to, we'll be the chicest tramps in Paris. I've also this high-brow book for kids... Italian. It's the story of three brothers who wonder what stinks so badly in their house. - So what does? - Me. The youngest had shit in his pants! - Not feeling well? - No, I'm fine. It's just, the flag is up. Sorry? That's what my mother called her... I thought the groom had tired you with his advances. Honeymoons are such a drag, I've had three. No, on the contrary. It's fine. Well, I've never seen him so happy. Hold on, please. I'm afraid it's for you. Malbrouk goes off to war, beef broth and onions... Malbrouk goes off to war... Not knowing when he'll return. You're on the brink of the abyss. Go back. In your turn... Go back. Go back. Leave me. Now, leave me. I want to be alone with my God. Stop. Stop, right here. I'll come with you. Stay. Are you sure? The bastards. After... I'll not leave the house. What's the matter? Help me! Help me. - Lead me. - Where? - Give me a baby. - Now? Stop prying! Invading my life! There are laws to protect people! - From other people. - I'll tell Mac Roi. - You're a real bastard. - Yes. You don't have the right! I don't know. - That really hurts. - Yes. - To what end? - None... I know your husband. A decent guy, I worked for him. Less uptight than other uptights. But Mac Roi's trying to shaft him. He's shafting everyone. They've announced they're getting into television. Diane's gonna head the channel and Jean... will take herjob here. - Great. - I like Diane. She made me. She asked me to join her to do live reportage. But I refused. Why? No reason. The negatives. You play sport here? No... If you did, what sport would you play? It's a bit old-fashioned... A ball game, Jeu de Paumes, know it? Seen what they did to your photos? I don't care. - Where are you off to? - To make up. "He had a multitude of mistresses." I don't believe it! That hurt. Had enough? I'm gonna take a shower. Mac Roi's put his sister over your husband's affairs. Just to show he's useless, despite their generosity. He needs another angle... - like what? - Something gutter like confessions of a hooker or a two-timing princess. Some real tacky shit. I do coke on occasion, relaxes me. But my tastes are working class. I dirt-track on the slag. Every Sunday, if I can, up north. Pretty unglamorous. Mines and miners. When there's no more mines, there's still slag. Apart from that, I do what I'm told. Fucker! Come on! Let's go! Did you see that fucker? Catholic fascist moraliser! True blood French my ass! I knew it! - It's war, everywhere! - Whose side are you on? - The underdog. - And? - What? - What then? You do what you're told and...? I fuck. Me too! I know! Fuck! What're you doing there? Know what time it is? I was waiting for you. - You've been crying? - No. What's the matter? Have pity on me, love me. I need you so. Isn't that all I do? Something happened? Something against us? You have doubts? You're unhappy? Yes. Are you sure? I don't know. Yes, you do. And that's why you're talking. Yes. - And you intend to... - I don't want to. Between want and can there's a difference. - You want that... - Yes, no... Yes. Yes, no... What? I want you to love and stand by me. I've done nothing. So, it's not too late? No. I'm your wife and I'm a little lost. Sounds a bit old hat, no? I'm terrible, I never even asked how you were. If you're here, I'm fine. Not here, over there, bottom right. I'll have him do more of this shit. You're boss now. No assignments? You're the only free hand here. Mac Roi is upstairs with Diane playing with their new toy. They plot by night, like vampires. Where are you going? Home. Oh, my love... So sweet and gentle... My wonderful... Iove... That Italian rat with his high-tech industries... I'll shaft him just like all the others. That's how it is... and it'll never stop. Because the world is too dumb and too... Short-lived. Why up so late? My second portfolio's ready, I'm junking what's left. How are you feeling? You... You're... Seeing someone else? Can you tell me who? It doesn't matter. It does to me. If I knew who it was I could stand down as husband... as lover, to console you. Or pity you. I'm off to Julia's tomorrow for a few days, if that's okay. I've to photograph the wedding preparations. I don't want to stay in Paris and... You're running? No, I'm fighting. Out of cowardice? No, because I'm your wife. It'd be awful... if you were to lie. But where am I to turn? When I see the others, I'm so happy to be with you. Iook at Bernard, Antoine... Even my mother was a real dragon. I'll be alright. Come, it's late and we're... Geni?vre, now there's a dragon for you! Giving us hell to show how obsolete we are. Giving us hell to show how obsolete we are. You're not obsolete, you're simply good. Is he in here? You didn't... - I'm no muckrake. - "I'm no muckrake". Sorry, I'm sorry... Just a family weakness... I'm calling a doctor! You don't have to be my wife. Stop this. You're free. We'll never cry again, we'll be happy... we'll love each other. You'll miss me. What are you on about? My love for you is boundless, it has no name, see? No, I've no eyes to see, no will, no life... No honour? I rooted in the bin. He's a boy with merit, handsome. He'll be in your portfolio? Then do me, I want in too. There, like that? Yes, like this. My father kept his word? It's a miracle. You've got the exclusive? Great, no? I don't know. I was afraid he'd loose his hounds. For a trashy scoop in all the scandal rags. The rich and ugly who've had enough. But I'm not like that. I want it to be just right. I'm worn out with all these fittings. I've bags under my eyes. Have I bags? You're fresh as a daisy. And you're smooth as silk. I wish I were that silky. I too am marrying the man I love. Do you love Cl?ve, Cl?lia? Let's go outside. They're destroying him, just like they did his father. Why don't you speak to... father, Cl?lia? I already did, once, but... Cl?ve has to be a man, and... That saved Cl?ve. It bought him time. Which never lasts. When they paired me off it was for business too. They said it didn't matter, that I could divorce if... The weakling son of an entrepreneur, ill into the bargain. But wonder of wonders, I fell in love! Just goes to show the wealth David brought isn't what they imagined. You hate him, don't you? Who? Mac Roi. Yes. Why? Because of girls like you. Cl?ve called, he's coming by train this evening! Thanks... for bringing it. It's very beautiful. Very naive, and very beautiful. He came to see me yesterday. I was in despair, ready to resign with my big kids' books and my poems... And the strangest thing happened. - Yes? - He made me an offer. The girl was with him... and she was up for it. Which girl? A model... quite pretty. One of those latter-day rakes... who'll earn a million a minute tomorrow... God knows why! And in fact, as it turns out... she's an Eritrean princess, from Gabon, near Chad, her name's Ina, or something. There's a war over there, it's terrible. So her parents managed to send her to Europe and then vanished. And her aunt ran an exotic call-girl ring so she became a high-class whore and then a model. And now she wants to tell her story. Why? Because she's known the worst and the best... And it was Nemo who saved her from drugs, prostitution, the whole cesspit. And he really risked his neck. She'd seen his child brothels portfolio and so she felt she'd like to speak out... She's doing it for him. No, to make the world a better place. That's impossible. But Cl?lia, it'd be a publishing scoop, if... If what? If someone photographed her. She's not short of photos. No, photos that are beautiful, genuine, true and not... Not what? Why can't he do it? Because with women he's only done porn. When he started out, he had to... Survive? But what for, Cl?ve? I don't know. I don't know what for! I don't know! I just had to have Bernard marry us. After your wedding... He's cute as a little pink pig. Runs in the family. Three brothers, the three little pigs. So harmless and... Here comes the big bad wolf. Friends! I'd like to toast my daughter and David's happiness. And to announce some good news. It's raining good news, let's hope it won't rain today. We've just interested Mr Gianfranco Giuliani in our publishing and TV activities. Gianfranco Giuliani needs no introductions. A man of taste, a creator, a patron of the arts, a lion of the telecommunications arena, a politician of the people, who one day will become prime minister of his country. Thought it was a toast for me. Not feeling well? Not at all well! Bored? I'm avoiding him. Here. Don't say a word. Or I'll fuck you on the ground and shoot you legs apart... And happy... happy at last. Promises, promises... - Thanks. - For what? For Cl?ve. It wasn't for Cl?ve. Here, you go up instead. It's your gig, you're better at this stuff. Not anymore. I'm staying on the ground. I'll get you for this. Stay here with me! You can't go up, you're too pissed. Stay there. What were you talking about? Cowardice, dignity, sport... I think. I've work to do. Come... Come with me. Let's go. Sit over there. For him and Jean, this is home. I holed up here a while with his old teacher, a really sweet guy who never wants to leave. Is that him? Which one is he? Got nine lives. Security blanket. But I had you worried. Like it here? Me too. See the race? Yeah, almost. Want a hand? I bartended for years. Nice to come and lose against the local lads. Your good deed for humanity. No way! I'm out there to fucking win! - What's that? - A scoop. My next big one after the child brothels. And really sick. We saw it on the telly! - Cut their balls off! - Fucking bastards! Wait till you see. Tell me it isn't sick. Eyes, still alive, like oysters. But they don't stay fresh for long. So they gotta be ripped out of the living. What for? Grafts. Big money, but no donors. So they use the old, the dying. Impossible. Some come from Africa, Rumania, Russia, the Caucasus... These ones are French. - Who does this? - Too risky to say. The child-traffickers are already out for my blood. But they're harmless compared to these guys. You'll wind up dead, boy. What the fuck are you on about? Why do I come here every Sunday? Iook at me! What the fuck do I come here for? You won't impress me with that stuff. Then what can I impress with? Tell me Teach! How can I impress? What're you eating? Kiss Cool. Can I have one? No... That one. Shit, fuck me! Dammit! Sexy, eh? Show me your arms. Isn't exactly easy. Worth a little effort. And your nape. Nice. You okay? Wanna keep walking, or... I dunno... You want we go somewhere? To the movies? To your place? Listen, with you I'm at a total loss. I can't ever see you again, Nemo. I don't have the... We just can't. Shit, Ina! Fuck! Fuck! Don't touch her, I'll call emergency. I told her to move out till they were behind bars! How is she? She'll make it, those chicks like surgery. Too good for you! Good my ass! Come from war, you belong to war! Come from the gutter, you'll end up in it! I gotta lie low a while. These eye deals are struck in Italy but the real scam is in Moscow and Peking. Nuns discovered them putting ping-pong balls in old-folks sockets. And in China it's... Show me. What, China? Your life. You mean my accidents. I'm a regular. Show me. Well? Nothing. No photos? No. - Tired? - Yes... No. - Want I carry you? - No. You're heavy! I rent it... I mean, it's a friend's. It's just next door to you. Still don't want to? I can't. But why? It's not because of your world, I know all that, but... But? But... You really get to me. And so? And so, that's not enough for you. As you like. But at least give me a keepsake. Your scarf. Give it here. Hold on a sec. Fuck me! The bishop, your husband's brother, has run off with a waitress, a mother of two. - Can you believe it? - Find that funny? I guess this means... Big scandal at the episcopate, we gotta find him. Well, off you go. Back the way we came, please. Want some tea? Thanks. Had a busy night? Not in the way you think. That's the first time you've used the familiar you. It's the first time I've not respected you. It's the first time you've not believed me. - Believe me. - No. I'm the one who told you everything. Did he touch you? Yes. He carried me to the taxi. And he touched my hand when I said I'd never see him again. - You believe me? - No, I find that... - Degrading? - Yes. Like what Bernard's done is degrading? How do you know that? Didn't you know? I'm a muckrake too. They'll set their dogs on poor Bernard. It's okay, he deserves it. He called, he's very happy. I'm happy for him. All the same... that woman does have children. He'll be a better dad to them than the guy she's leaving. Why do you say that? She's leaving him for Bernard. Do you understand? I'll never be untrue to you. Never. I've never lied to you. I'm not saying the temptation isn't strong... but it's also painful. And like harm, unimportant. It's nothing... I've packed my stuff. Giving you free rein. But don't you see? I have free rein! I'm going to join Bernard and Antoine. He's in a hotel in Plougastel in Brittany, "The Happy Inn". What is it that matters, Cl?lia? Us, you, me... You with me, you without me... Us... you... he... him? "Oh but what worm "Am I the victim of "That you then unabashed "Did what I never wished "Confessed another love "And I submissive, felt "Unwanted and went out?" Jean, a titbit for your dogs. Bishop Bernard is in Brittany, in Plougastel in a hotel called "The Happy Inn". Facing, once more. Iook at me. No, over there. Take off your glasses, back in position... Hold it! Open your mouth a little, breathe... lower your chin. Harden that look. Relax, relax... Afraid of the vibrations? Like you're scared of something, panic... Nice. Breathe out, now in... This scandal which has the nation in thrall, has rocked the Catholic church. Here we are at "The Happy Inn" in Plougastel from where our runaway bishop is soon to emerge from his overnight love-nest. So, we're waiting. And now back to our Paris studios. Here they come! Easy does it! Let them be! Show a little humanity. Back off! Monsignor! A word, Monsignor... So Monsignor, God was no longer enough for you? Man... has the right to happiness... even if he discovers it too late... and in circumstances... Iove surprises us... where we least expect it. But if we don't grasp it... we cannot understand divine love... We are... like invalids. But does a man of God have that right? Everyone has that right. God is not somewhere up there. He is... in us. What I really mean is... He is... us. As we are Him. Thank you, Monsignor. We are touched by the Monsignor's sincerity... ...l'll do the rounds of the book fairs. Tokyo, Frankfurt, Paris, now that I've something to offer, thanks to your photos, and what since befell that girl. Like I said, you owe me nothing. I'd the luck to seduce you, but not to be loved by you. I kiss you. I love you... Your husband, Cl?ve. Saint-Andr?? What time is it with you? The same time. Right, I'm sorry... Remember college? You never liked me. No... Yes, well, no. I didn't measure up. You left in such a hurry. You snubbed me, I wasn't sufficiently... Want your revenge? Or on the contrary, to prove I was right. My wife loves another. She's two-timing me. And I want to be sure... Because everyone's lying. - Can you have one of your... - Dogs. Track her. Nemo would be best... No. The only vicious thing you'll ever have done... eh, Cl?ve? The third portfolio... Hi, there. Everyone's making movies these days, so I am too. Starring you and me. May I? "The honour to seduce you". Unquote. That's you. I am me. The market value of a corpse varies from third world to developed countries. A human skeleton is worth $1000, before tax. "These are hands..." This new market for human tissue has a promising future. So much so that firms like Cryolite are already on the stock exchange. In France, human skin and corneas are in short supply... Fucking hell! I told you it was war! So how does it feel to shoot someone? Good. Hope I didn't kill anyone. It'd be one bastard less. No, I can't! I'm sick of it! Sick of what? What more do you want, Cl?lia? Haven't I bared myself enough? What do you want? Me totally naked? - Stop... - I can't bare myself more! - Stop it... - More I cannot give! Stop, stop... It's just, you're the youth I never had. So I'm young, dumb and worthless. And once you've seen all my shit, you'll go back to your hunky-dory world of books, firesides and slippers. No... I said yes once. You can say no when you're out of yes. It's my big break... Faces, shoot-out, lover, the lot! Your wife? That's our dilemma. If we publish, and this is big, without the adultery pictures no one will believe us. It'll seem like ajournalistic set-up, organised and implausible. Why was there ajournalist present at that moment? - That very moment. - To trap the criminals. Firing real bullets? No one'd run that risk. Not just illegal, but downright criminal. If we publish, we legitimise the photographer by showing the lover's tryst. In the end, he was working for the husband. - Our speciality, no? - And we're the best. Need we add that it's the very same Nemo who through our care has become darling of the press. All he needs is Snowy to be Tintin. Remember? No, and anyhow... there'll always be paparazzi, upstarts too. Know what this Nemo asked for his exploits? Captain Haddock? A motorcycle, albeit expensive. You can't shake off your social origins. And concerning our friend Cl?ve... That is what you wanted proof of... is it not? Yes. So what have you to be ashamed of? You family is scandal, your wife is scandal... like Diane says, all is scandal. We are scandal, but you... are a victim, not tarnished, not guilty. I can protect you. From? Yourself. Does that bother you? No. Then let's tell Mac Roi the good news, he'll love it. As a favour, I'll hold this one. All's well that ends well, no? David darling, can't you walk a bit faster? No. - You're not pregnant? - No. I am. Can't feel it yet, it's just a little pea. But how could you be if Cl?ve's never there. I'd have taken a lover. Can't beat a lover! No, I'd never do that. You believe me? He's back, but he totally ignores me. I didn't tell you, but we brought you along to hook Giuliani, his printing works, paper factory, plush editions... His TV network, his money. He wouldn't talk to dad. Dad's no epitome of good taste, but your portfolios are the in-thing in Italy, even if... our Sunday circulation's dropped since we've run them. I see. - So you think that... - No... Eh, David? We don't think so. Not yet, anyhow. Asshole... Go see to that charlie he's getting on my wick. If he is mixed up in this organ traffic with the deals we've signed, I'll clean up! Why're you telling me? So, getting familiar. - I still want you. - Yes. - We've only one life. - Yes. You're unhappy in this one? Yes. That's plain to see. It's your body that's crying. - He doesn't fuck you right? - He does. I would have... It would have been even worse. I've only ever known men like you... and I'm thirty years old. Take the Japanese... I do a lot of business with them. They think true beauty lies in that instant before the flower withers... before the skin of the fruit crinkles in the cold. And after? - Finished you two? - Never. Come my girl, and make me a work of art. The last. Kept my promise! A custom Triumph, the best! Thanks to our friend, Gianfranco! Come on, show us what you can do! Coming with me? Security blanket. Today, at the Church of Our Saviour, was held the funeral of Mr Mac Roi, CEO of the Mac Roi Group killed in the attack in which his sister, Geni?vre Mac Roi received superficial wounds. The young motorcyclist was but injured. It is feared that reprisals will continue as indictments multiply after the organ ring was cracked. Over 20 people have been arrested in 4 countries. You old tart, I was the only one. My knickers! Diane, you stay. All stay but you, Saint-Andr?. You're fired. Mother, your nose is over-powdered. We've obtained a medical cert. Mother is not fit to preside. Sorry, Mother, but your brain's gone... So you can live dolled up as you like... Thanks to agreements signed by my father... Mr Giuliani's arrest has strengthened our hold on Europe. After a rest to heal her wounds of body and heart, my aunt will work to implement all this. Diane's to be promoted, but also independent. She will set up a film-production outlet based in los Angeles. Films are to be in English, TVwill remain local. But I won't deal with her directly. She'll go through David. She has carte blanche. I shall replace my aunt. I'll make sure our papers are even more depraved, hypocritical, more vicious, our TV more stupefying, in the proper sense of the word. We'll make even more money so our literary activity may become the world's finest. Cl?ve and David... I asked Cl?lia to be here as my father's token daughter, our collaboration over, she's getting compensation... I beg you, I'm your wife. I want to live with you. All I can reproach you for is having killed an illusion. Why don't you believe me? Why do you think all has to be filth, lies and sex! Because it is! I'll never be untrue to you! - It's done! - Never, never! It's there, but without you I'd never have loved. Say it, you know how! I tried to cheat on you, I couldn't. You'll miss me. Even death, you make it sweeter. Here... Didn't know one could die of love? No. Gonna go with...? You free? No. I will be. We return unto the earth he who has left us. He who so wished to love, receive him into Your light. That light in which he sees the truth of all things. In the name of our lord Jesus Christ, Amen. So much has happened. Her Paris Portfolio became like ajournal, a novel. So alive, so human... Whereas at first, I'd called her photos cold. And as for you, you admit having been a paparazzo, I mean, a press-hound. And yet your album... has such formal beauty, such rigour. It's dedicated to Cl?lia, as Cl?lia's is to you. It's as if... they were by the same person. As if one heart were beating within. Do you know what's become of her? Where she is? Why she disappeared? No. Come along! Lunch is ready! Fernand! Fernand? Forgive me. Forgive me. Subtitles by: Peter leonard Processed by: C.M.C. - Paris
