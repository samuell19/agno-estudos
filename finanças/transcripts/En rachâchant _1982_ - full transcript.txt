I won't go back to school! Why? Because at school they teach me things that I don't know! Great! He's a small brown-haired boy with glasses. He doesn't draw much attention. No, I haven't seen Ernesto. No one sees him! It's as if he didn't exist! Bring him to me. Is it you, Ernesto? Exactly. Indeed, indeed. I don't recognize you. I recognize you. You see what he's like? So! You refuse to be taught, little Ernesto? Exactly. - And why? - Because it takes too long. - But school is required! - Not everywhere. Here, we are here! We're here, we're not everywhere. Yes! And this man here? Who is that? A man. And that? At least tell us what this is, little Ernesto. A crime. And this, is it a football? A potato? It's a football, a potato, and the earth. An idiot! That's what he'll be. - No, don't worry. - But it's a shame. Not at all. - You think so? - I'm sure. Strange. What's to become of us? Seven, I have seven! - It's a unique case. - That's something at least. So we find ourselves before a child who only wants to learn what he already knows. That's right. I have seven and they're too much for me. But tell us, little Ernesto, how you plan to learn what you don't know yet? That's right. By re-pea-ting! - What did you say? - A new method. Outrageous! - I don't understand anything. - I'm lost too. And what, little Ernesto, do you already know? Nothing, just look at him! And besides everything else, he's completely crosseyed. It seems to me that I asked a question. What do you know, little Ernesto? I know. Don't you touch him, or I'll hit you. Very well. But why does little Ernesto refuse to learn that which he does not know yet? Why? - Answer, Ernesto, if you understand. - Why? Because it's not worth learning! That's the heart of the matter. - The heart of the heart! - The heart of the heart! But how will little Ernesto learn how to read? And write? And add? In these conditions? Huh? I'll know. How? In-e-vi-ta-bly. Be careful what you say or you'll annoy me, little Ernesto. Nothing's wrong, calm down! I'm going home. So? So? Now that he's left, what's your opinion? - It's an impressive case. But apart from that? What do we do with him? Is he right that he'll learn to read one day? Drive and not drive? Eat and drink? Work, work? Fool himself and not fool himself, and everything else? Alas, yes. Subtitles time-adjusted by Bill Davis
