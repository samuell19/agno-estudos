Anastasia BEZBORODOVA Get back, the train's moving! You...! Sergei SHEKHOVTSOV - Tanya, I'm here! - Watch out! - Are you crazy? - The train was moving! You Moscow idiots! Police? He almost fell under the wheels! And I'd go to jail for it! Moscow, where's the metro? Over there. - Over there? - Yes. I answer for you, see? He could've been killed by the train! Written by Alexei MIZGIREV Police! What do you need the photo for? Don't be so smart, OK? She's my fiancee, man. Ok, let him go. Production Designer - Denis SHIBANOV We have exactly the same houses at home! Almetevsk! Produced by Sergei SELYANOV Photography by Vadim DEEV Directed by Alexei MIZGIREV HARD-HEARTED Hey, Almetevsk! Anton? Is that you, neighbor? Yeah, Uncle Kolya. - I'll be damned. - Hi! There is no hiding from you guys even in Moscow! No way! Who told you my address? My mother? That's right. Are you out or just on leave? I'm out! - What a guy! - Same to you! It's good you are alive and kicking. Alive and kicking, yes. - Not quite alive. - You were crippled? Shut up, stupid. Were you wounded? No. I was killed on a mission. I'm dead. Are you kidding? Just joking. Have you already been home? How is your mother? She's all right. Hey, you're a rich guy. Oh, come on, it's a Korean car, not a rich guy's car. - Real cheap. - I wanted to ask... Well... Business isn't great right now... but if you don't need much... - How's Zina? - What do you mean? What about Zina? She's a student now. Yes, she studies at the institute. She's at the institute now? She's at Megapolis, with her friends. - She's where? - The cafe Megapolis. Vacation time! Remizov? I'm out. - How was the army? - Real useful. The army is good for you. You come in a rookie, you leave a real man, smart as a senator. The army builds discipline and character. "You don't want to - we'll make you!" The army is a real school, you use your muscles for real stuff. They teach you to break bricks with your hand. - No shit! - You're kidding. - Try me. - Are all your friends like this? He's not my friend. Only paratroopers cut bricks with their hand. A serious joke. What are you doing? I'll call the police! Are you crazy or what? I'm starving! Buy a Swiss watch - They're the best. I'm looking for a present for my friend. Care for a watch? For you? Come on, it's vacation. You mean you were paid in the army? How much a month? - Are these Swiss watches? - And Russian. Only Swiss for me. Look, this one has precious stones. - Pick out a Swiss watch! - Don't be stupid! You can't buy a Swiss watch here! These are fakes from China. - It's Chinese? - No, it's got precious stones. He's not lying. Do you have a certificate? Show it to me. Lady, it's made in Malaysia, not in China. European license and all. The Swiss don't make watches anymore, only Asians do. You see? Let's go. You mean he was lying? It's Moscow, Remizov. - You wanted to cheat me, Moscow? - Get lost! - What? - Let's go, Anton. Show me a certificate! Let's go. There's too many of them. Please, Anton. But you wanted a watch. It's vacation time. Stay here, you jerk, and don't leave. Okay, I'm staying here. You idiot, Remizov! Neutral territory? Like Switzerland! Switzerland! You were right, Zina. I'm still green. - You sent me this photo? - So what? You sent it to me! Remizov, go home. - Hi, buddy. - So, you found me again. - My wife told you? - No, that Korean of yours. - Korean? - Is this your shop? We opened a month ago - barely making it. Will you take Anton Remizov on your team? Team? We don't have work for the two of us. - Sparkplugs. - On your team, neighbor. Everyone in Almetevsk knows you have a business. You came to make some money? Nah, I came to live here. - What can you do? - Everything. I was tested in the army. I'm a fighter to the end. They all say they can do everything. Try me. Anton, I don't need fighters. We make money. We work. I can work, too. Damn! - Where's the money? - In the cash register. There's only half of it here! You paid for the tires, remember? What do we do now? Problems? - It'll do. - I'll show them. Anton, be quiet, if something goes down. Okay? I don't want to lose my business. Hey! Where is the money? - Hey. - You brought it? - You OK? - OK. What is this crap? - I'm sorry. - What the hell? - Hand over the money. - I'll pay later. - Where is the money? - I'll pay later. - Pay up now! - I'll pay later! - Cough it up! - I don't have it right now. Now, I said! - Take my car as security! - Give it to him! Take the car. And you'll owe me. We'll have to return the tires. At the end of the month we'll buy tires from a fence. - We have a lot of orders! - And I don't have a car. You were wrong to give them the car. You need more than workers, buddy. Anton, go home. Your mother is all alone there. She's the one who needs you. - You think so? - Yeah, I do. Wait, Anton. Don't tell them at home... Well, don't tell them how I'm doing here. One ticket to Almetevsk. Your passport. - Are you open? - Ten rubles. - Do you accept dollars? - It's a pay toilet. What? Is this some kind of joke? Don't start in. No discounts. You want me to pay for shitting? Open the gate, you frigging sentry! Stop whistling! I tried to stop him, but he jumped the gate. - Is he drunk? - No. - Just a nutter. - Show me your documents. I just got here. Don't know what's up. No money - hold it in. What are you doing in Moscow? Just out of the army. Came to the capital. - It was my dream. - Are you traveling? - Yes. - Where to? - Almetevsk. - Pay the entrance fee. Trying to scare the shit out of me? - Fuck you. - Don't be a wise-ass. I'll show you. Screw your show - pay the fee. Moscow needs kopeks? Wait outside. Get up! You want more? Sorry, sir. Got it. Help me to forgive you, man. One ticket. Am I dismissed? Want to work with us? We take guys out of the army. I'll think about it. You do that. Where are you going? What about your ticket? You want some beer? Some cold beer? I'm on duty. Come on, don't be mad. They're joking to stay awake. Check it, sergeant. Solid flint. So what? Flint? This is flint... When you use your head, you wake up. Try cracking it down there. I have no wife to practice on. Sergeant Chakhlov, what's going on here? Remizov, follow me. You're off to a bad start. Sorry. I can write an explanatory note. Or resign. Why should I? We're not in the army. You sleep and drink on duty. - Major... - And BS... gets you fired. I'm fresh out of the army. - I won't drink, on my word. - Who needs your word? - Prove it. - I will. Close the door. Do any of them take bribes? No. Don't give me that. You make friends with him? Chakhlov? Do you know what Chakhlov is involved in? No. But I'll tell you if I find out. I won't hide it. This isn't civilian life, it's Moscow. Remember: it's all the other way round in Moscow. - Go back to work. - Yes, sir. What did the major want? He said I'm on probation. - And? - To get my act together. So probation goes okay. The major is new here, he doesn't get how things are done. Keep me posted. We're like brothers now. I'm tough, not dumb, Sergeant. We're all brothers here, got it? - Got it. - You sure? Got it. Look, they caught you near a corpse. You've had it. Too bad they don't have the firing squad. Because it would serve you right, you freak. See, it's a tricky situation: we can report that you wanted to fuck a corpse, and no lawyer will get you off. Write it up! Quit dancing with him. He's a freak, a psycho. - Which crime? - 105. - The whole package. - Are you sure? What's the deal? There's a corpse, he was naked in a pool of sperm. And he had a gun. No lawyer will get him off. It's clear as day - premeditated murder. Please don't. "Please" costs a lot... - You wanted to say something? - Yes. It was that bitch's fault. Listen, make it quick. Bring the money here! Not here, you dick-head. No, not here! No! The SWAT team's here, the hookers and the murderer. Murderer? Oh, come on. It's just a bunch of whores. - In fact, forget the whores. - I'm tough, not dumb. - What about the stiff? - We got our own problems. He has a passport on him. - A Muscovite! - He's no good! That scarred whore called the police. Can't speak Russian, but called a special unit. They found a corpse. It's registered. - We need a murderer. - This one's a murderer? No. Let's go. It's late. Is everyone here? All of them. Sixteen people. Are you sure? We don't go out, we don't receive guests. It's against the boss's rules. Count off. Are they all morons here or what? Light! How many? Fifteen! But there are 16 passports. I'm number 16. Number 15, follow me. - Any drugs, weapons on you? - No. I can't hear you! Any drugs, weapons on you? Have mercy, Sergeant. Take out your weapon and drugs! How much do I owe you? Where's the dope? - Eh? - My brother can pay! Where's your weapon? The dope? Give it to me! Let me call my brother! Give me a hand. Give me his passport. Any requests, grievances? No, everything's fine. And then I stabbed the prostitute with a knife... It gives me the creeps to listen to all this. I bought the knife at the market... It's yours. You earned one grand. Thanks, Sergeant. - No. - Are you sick? On the wagon. Got a woman? Not yet. Get married, man, settle down in Moscow. Marriage is number two in my plan. What's number one? I don't need money. I need a car. That's number one? What car do you want? In the army guys said Korean cars are good. Cheap and reliable. You owe me now. You'll only need to paint the door, it's a good car. I'll work it off. With a car, it's a cinch to get a woman. It's a good plan. Moscow! I'm from Samara! Samara rules! Wait... - May I, Aunt Tanya? - It's late! - Is my buddy home? - He's sleeping. - Tell him it's very important. - Nikolai, wake up. What? - Hi. - Hi, buddy. So, you decided to stay in Moscow? I have to take care of some business right away. - Haste is waste. - Right. You don't owe them anymore. No more worries. You mean it's my car? Now your business will take off. That's what you came about? No. I want to marry your Zina. - Where is she now? - In a cafe with her friends. Was there anything between the two of you? You were dating each other? There was nothing, right, Anton? There was a photo. It's a good photo. Do we have it? "Dear Anton! On behalf of our class" "Congratulations on Red Army Day." "Good luck in the service." "Come back soon." "Zina Gaenko." A few words about myself. I got a profession in the army. I can work as a plasterer. I read books. "Man should be beautiful in all aspects..." You will never be ashamed of me. Zina has a hobby, you know. She doesn't smoke, but collects ash-trays. Nikolai... - Sit down. - I'm all right, I can stand. - Are you drunk? - No. - You smell of vodka. - Stop it, Tatyana. - Do you smoke? - I quit. Should we marry off our Zina? She's the one to decide. It's her life. Fine. I'll ask. You won't be in my way? Of course not, buddy. Let's ask her right now? She's not home. Got it. - You got it? - Got it. - Take care, buddy. - Bye. There was nothing between them, I'm sure. - He's a nice kid. - You want to marry an idiot? That idiot returned your car! - We brought you to Moscow! - I didn't ask you to. Nikolai! I told you not to give out our address! Stupid. Don't get upset. Your heart! - Take it easy. - Stupid! - I need to talk to the boss. - What do you want? Call your boss. Nikolai, someone here for you. What? - What do you want? - I want to sell it. - You mean it's real? - Yes. - Where did you get it? - A present from hunters. - Bear hunters? - Nah, they stun fish with them. I'm not interested. Please, I can sell it cheap. It's illegal. I'm dying without money. I'll buy it. It'll come in handy. You'll be the one to end in prison for this. - Just a little bit today. - Keep it. We're doing this for our brother. How much longer? We need to call in sappers. It's concrete. They don't even have a lock, bitches! What are you looking for? Remizov, take him away! Hold 'em up! - Do you remember me? - No. Doesn't matter. Do you have documents on the tires? Ask my boss. Goods not cleared by customs are illegal. I don't know anything. Are you local? So what? Now I know why you're a wise-ass. What do you want? Who's the owner? Must be you, Muscovite. So what? Who will answer for the illegal tires, Moscow? Forgive me, man. Help me to forgive you, man. - I'll be off. - Okay. My word's like flint. Why did you do this to me? I told you I'd fight to the end. Let me go, buddy. Do you remember Almetevsk? Sergeant, I found it! Sergeant! - Where? - In his pocket. This is crazy! Can't you see what's going on? - You two from the same town? - Yes, sir. You're a total freak, Remizov. - You arrested my father! - Exactly. - What for? - Now this is it. Now I'm Moscow. You were right to move here. You'll live better now. Live better? You're an idiot. Your father's a fool, not me. - He's weak, I'm strong. - Let him go. It's for you to decide. And no one will be in your way now. There's someone there. Hi. I don't want to. - You don't want to eat? - No. Why? - Modified products. - So why did you come? I'll live with you. - Your mother made you? - You like riddles? This is no riddle. Open up. - It's open. - Open up. I have a present for you. It's for you. Vacation time. Who the hell are you? What do you want, you scum? I had it done in the army. "Zina" Can you release my father? He was arrested. I don't have money for ransom. My mother didn't make me, I came here myself. So, what next? This... - Can you go on? - No. - Another riddle? - It's for you to decide. Uncle Kolya? How can we? When my father is in prison? Hi. The left blinker's out of order. I quit. But I like to inhale smoke. - Did you see Nikolai? - We need to talk. He has to be released. Are you crazy? You told me to lock him up. It's very important, Sergeant. He had a grenade. It's registered. Do it today for me, Sergeant. Money won't help. It's all I have. You know that. Didn't I tell you? He's a total freak! - Sergeant... - Take away your money. - Got it. - Are you sure? I'm tough, not dumb. - Hi, number 16. - Excuse me? - Do you remember me? - No. Doesn't matter. Do you want to help number 15? We don't come out. We have a life of our own. It's for you. I don't need anything. Why are you doing this, Remizov? I promised to tell you if I found out about Chakhlov. Wait in the hall. What else do you know? Yesterday the owner of a garage was arrested, Nikolay Gaenko. It was a frame up, Major. He has a daughter, a student... He should be released. It's just not fair. A student, you said? It's not what you think. I promised you - I keep my word. The facts are wrong. Redo it. Got it. The door? The lock. Can you fix it? No problem. I need to talk to you. - I quit drinking. - Me, too. - Because of your health? - Yes. Bad heart. That's a lousy break. - We need to talk. - I know everything. You mean, you know about her fiance? What? They've been dating for 6 months and are setting the date... - A student? - And a Muscovite, too. He lives around the corner. You should forget her. Show your character. - Will I make it? - I'm just like you. - So: Moscow! - I saw worse times. Okay, then. Let it be. Let her get married. You remember how we lived? Near the ash-dump. We want our daughter to live a decent life. Relax, Uncle Kolya. My word's like flint. That's a man! Same to you, Uncle Kolya! But you promised, Anton! Almetevsk! Hi, fiancee. I forgot to ask you something important. Should I go back to school? It's very useful: you enter a green-horn. and in 5 years you're a pro. - And one more question. - Go ahead. - The photo... - It was the teachers' idea. - Tell me: yes or no? - No, Remizov. Was it some kind of joke? No. It was a social gesture you took for something else. - And now? - What, "now"? It's yes with me, no with you. But can't you say "yes"? But you promised, buddy. My word's like flint! Neutral Switzerland! Switzerland! - Well? - Fine. - Funny? - To me, yes. - A joke. - That's it. Fine, then. Here's to our guys! What about you? I don't drink. To our guys! Why quit? Afraid of the sergeant? No, this is the wrong profession. He'll give you no peace, that Chakhlov. I'll go back home. I'm sick of it here. You're in a tough spot. The Tajiks' case is dicey. You might get pulled in. And go to jail, not home. - What do I do? - Give evidence. And sign it. You're a cop, not some Tajik. You can give the details about Chakhlov... Don't be afraid, I'll help you beat the rap. - Do you hear me? - I don't quite understand. Stop playing the fool. It's the wrong time for it. Sorry. Sit down. Chakhlov is scum. They all are. You're different. You're just messed up. We'll transfer you to Internal Security. Issue a gun. We need guys like you, brave and honest. Make up your mind. Why did you come to Moscow? I don't quite understand. I don't want to see you here again. I want to work another week. Though, by law, it's two weeks. One week, Remizov. And then - get out. Dismissed. Yes, sir. - You need any explanation? - No. You got me? I'm tough, not dumb. You gonna kill me? If I want to. A man should keep his word, Sergeant. You owe me, cop. First you return your debt. I was expecting you to do this. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I'm fresh out of the army. I'll answer for the Korean. My word's like flint. The code's in the right corner of the door post. It's used by electricians and plumbers. You go in the house and hide. When he appears, shoot him in the back, and head - when he falls down. Two shots in the head, you got it? Yes. One shot in the back, two to the head. May I ask something? Is he local? Why should you care? It would be easier to kill a Muscovite. Bad luck: he is not local. He's from Samara. - I need a clean piece. - It's absolutely new. - Does it work? - Check it. Checking... One...! Do you have cartridges, Samara? You should meet a woman, Remizov. It's vital for you. I know. There he is. Time... time... Don't. - Can you speak Russian? - No. You can't understand? I dreamed about Moscow. I would draw the Kremlin at school, the sawtooth walls. I thought, Moscow: a real city, the capital. I want to go home. I hate this life. To hell with the sawtooth walls. Shit, I'm scared. Do you want to go away? Tell me: yes or no? Just say something. That night you wanted to go away. I'll help you go home. Are you scared? What's wrong? - I wanted to help her. - Did you help? - Not yet. - She could've stayed home. Refugees! Maybe I feel lousy, too. Maybe. - Stop playing the idiot. - Got it. - Asking for trouble? - I'll show you. Go home, man, you're drunk. No way. I don't drink. Here, pay the maid, refugee. What? - What? - Why are you here? - I'm working. - It's the right moment. - Now it's my turn. - Your turn? To say "what"? - Hey, what's the matter? - Nothing. Just saying. - Just saying "what"? - Just saying. - I have a question. - A question? About the right moment. - I mean our business. - You mean the Samara guy? - Yes. - Now I got it. - Are you sure? - I'm tough, not dumb. I need to change my clothes. Got the gun? Hide it. - Hey, Samara... - What? Please don't! Let me at least get up! Motherfucker! Don't! Don't, please! It jammed. You're a chocolate piece of shit, not flint, Remizov. I'll prove my worth, Sergeant. Take my advice: leave Moscow. - Do you remember me? - No, officer. - And now, you jerk? - How do you do, officer. - Give me your gun. - What gun? Remember? Forgive me, officer. Help me to forgive you. Is that scarred whore here? - What's your problem? - Are you deaf or what? You're deaf, not me. There's no one here. I'm asking about a scarred whore! There's no one here. I see. On the floor! Get a unit here! Get a unit! Police station, duty officer. Hello...? She'll go home, Sergeant. You did this for the chick? That's not the point. I promised her. It's not civilian life, it's Moscow. Go home. You may go home now. My word's like flint. "Policeman breaks up gang of pimps" I sold my car when Alex was born. Then they took away my apartment. She had Alex registered in her new apartment, and cheated me. She's not all bad. She lets me sleep at her place in winter. Sergeant... Vacation time? Vacation! - I saw you on TV. - It was BS. My father said it's true. No wedding ring? You aren't married? Can't you solve riddles? So, there was no fiancee? My father made it up. Who needs people from Almetevsk? - So? - What do you mean? - I mean the institute. - I don't know yet. - Don't be slow about it. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. What did she want? An ashtray? - She talked about the institute. - And you? - I promised her father... - Promised what? - What about this one? - He has no registration. Sergeant, forgive me. Help me to forgive you. Release him. Let him go. - Are you sure? - My word's like flint. Thank you, Sergeant! Translated by Svetlana Chulkova
