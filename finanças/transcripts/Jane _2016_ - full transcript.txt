Written & Directed by CHO HYUN-HOON You know, I was not a truthful girl from the moment I was born. You know what? The first thing I uttered was a lie. I will never ever be loved. JANE Back when... Back when I was living in a motel with Jung-ho. Dammit, him again? You got nothing else to talk about? So where's the asshole now? Don't know. He still doesn't answer my call. He ran off while I was sleeping, that's why. Like a burglar. So I guess he won't answer me. Hey, can we open the window? Shit, it really stinks in here. It smells like... that rotten turtle in the fish tank. Hi. How are things? I'm doing all right. You may not care. But I went to the motel. I mean the motel where Jung-ho abandoned me and took off. But I don't want to go into a great detail about him. Except that I wanna say I was at the motel like a fool. I thought maybe someone would be there. Someone to take me somewhere. Howdy. So you're back. Is Jung-ho in there? Hey, you're bleeding, huh? New World Are you awake? Hey, don't touch it. Ah, It's too itchy. Don't touch. Let me see your hand. The wound is about here, right? Don't you ever touch it. I've been to new world, too. I came to write this letter recalling someone at New World. Jane. That's her name. When I was at a shelter, I saw a dead turtle in a fish tank. But you know, nobody would clean it. So some furry stuff grew on the carcass. Once I saw a cat lying dead with guts bulging out. You know, it smells awful like poop. Ever seen a pigeon getting run over by a car? It happened in a split second. Dae-Po, how come you saw such a thing? It was there for all to see. You sucker, why are you picking on me? They'd think I'm a weirdo. What about you, So-hyun? Me...? My mom. Huh? Laura and I got done working, then I left. Come now, why would I take that? Why would I take the mirror ball? What would I need that for? Ask Laura. Bye. My goodness! What are you up to? Hi. You're out here to eat all that stuff alone. How silly of you. You want some? Jane liked Jung-ho. She said to everybody that she was his lover. "Every night in my dreams, Jung-ho and I are lovers." "That's good enough. As long as I believe so." What are you doing? Ah, I found it. It's from the resting room computer. You know, at night time, they take the mouse away. So I hid it here to play games with Jung-ho. Why are you putting it back? It's too dear to throw away. Jung-ho gave it to me last spring, saying he was working in Incheon. Incheon Night Club Pharaoh KANG Jung-ho - Stranger I see. So-hyun, don't worry about him. I'll find out more about him. OK? I don't worry about him. He's an asshole. I often wish that he'd drop dead. Oh, come on. I'm fine. I'm looking for him on behalf of her today. Hey! You're crazy! She scared you, didn't she? Oh, my. So barbaric. Why do you keep the kids with you? Why? Your family looks very different from others. Your kids don't even work. Work? Why should you? When you get a little older, you'll have to work till you drop dead. Not yet. You know what I think? Life ain't much fun at all. I have this feeling that your misfortune begins at birth and... lasts forever. Happiness comes only in... bits and... pieces. Life is so shitty, so why live alone? Do you get it? Anyway, that's why I keep you with me. Well, I think I understand. Oh my, what's that? Hey, lady. You can't take that. Look, lady. You can't take that. Lady! Hey you, lady! Cut it! Finder's the keeper! What? That's what I sell. Give it back to me. Let go of me. Beat it. That's mine! Incheon Night Club Pharaoh KANG Jung-ho - Stranger Business Closed: Thank you for patronizing Club Pharaoh Back at the shelter, you said you don't care about Jung-ho. What made you say that? When you say stuff like that, it hits the sky and bounces back at you. Is that what you want? Yes. Do you want him to be happy? A while back, you said life is shitty and so we must suffer together. Then Jung-ho must suffer, too. Well... you aren't that smart after all. Look. Wake up! My dear. Yes? Come over here for a moment. What's wrong with your foot? How did it happen? I've always had it. Does it look odd to you? No. Isn't it uncomfortable? No, it's not. Even if I know I have a little toe missing, sometimes I feel it itchy as if I had it. That's all. Okay. Doesn't it sound weird? What's weird? It's not weird at all. You know what, you're the first person. Everybody asked me why I have a missing toe. They don't believe that sometimes I feel like there's nothing missing. Right... same here. People see something even if I say it's not there. I have something very special which makes me a liar. Hush, she may wake up. Stop laughing. Be quiet now. - What kind of surprise is this? - Oh dear, she's awake. What a mess. Because of you guys. Look here. How many slices are left? Three, right? Suppose something like this happens to you down the road. You should make sure everybody gets a fair share. You know what Mom's saying? I'd rather have the three of us skip it. Once you start being petty, then that's the end of your life. Let's eat. Hello? One sec please. Are you by yourself right now? I'm uh... I found out where Jung-ho is. I see. You want to see him? I don't think I'll go. I'm too busy with my work. And I don't have the right clothes. So I'm not going to see him. I hope you will, though. He might be happy to see you. Where did you go today? I didn't go anywhere. Is that right? What did you do today? I smoked. And? And... I whistled. Sis, why do you keep bringing kids over to your place of business? Sorry. Hey, who the hell are you to complain to me? Are you my boss or something? I don't like them. They're too young. - Hello. - Oh, hey! Mom, why just the two of us? Look at the moon. It's a full moon. All right. Come on over. All right. Come on over. All right. Come on over. All right. Come on over. Repeat after me. Repeat after me, now. All right. Come on over. All right. Come on over. All right. Come on over. What's that stuff you keep taking? Do you need to take that? Girls. Do you know what my real name is? Kyung-hwan. JO Kyung-hwan. If I take it, my head get full of warm water. I hear the sound of the wind, whiff, whiff. From then on, JO Kyung-hwan turns into a person named Jane. On the stage, she becomes a sweetheart for everybody. Mysterious, isn't it? Sometimes I remember Jane standing on a stage. On that particular day, it seemed that she sang for me. It could be my misunderstanding, but that's what I believe. For that was the first and last time I saw her on stage. Mom. Why does someone get anorexia? Anorexia? Who's got that? You're the one who has it. Ji-su. I don't have anorexia. What is it then? I... have a lovesickness? Jung-ho feels burdened by us. He's doing well now. He has a job and a girlfriend too. Let's forget about him now. Let's give him up. Whistle for me. What? Whistle for me. Oh, yeah. What is it? Kimbap. Great. I was hungry. One, two, three, four. Looks so good. Hey, I don't have enough for you. I have only 11 rolls. Are you curious why I wrote this letter? Are you by any chance curious where I am and what I'm doing? Actually, I am alone again now. All the dreamlike moments are gone. Everything will go back to the way it used to be. Back to when there was no one to listen to my story and no one to share their story. Hey, you! Hey! Stop pretending you're sleeping. Come on over now. Okay? Why is she still there? You think she passed out? I didn't beat her so bad. Go wake her up. You do it, dad. What did you just say? Forget it... Wait, wait. Wait a minute! Lift him up when I say three! One, two, three! You're one ugly bastard. - You look awful ugly. - Morons, you're both the same. You sure look ugly. Hey, you, come on over here. What the hell are you doing there? You think I was unfair? No. Bull. Tell me the truth. It's just, I don' know. You don't know? Hey, think about it. This here, it may not be much money, but the thing is, It's money for all of us. So you shouldn't touch it. I really didn't steal any money, though. That's it. Pack up and leave. What? The way you talk, I can tell you're gonna bring this family down. Sorry. I messed it up. Messed up what? Um... I'm kind of new here, unable to get along with you all. I'll try to do better from now on. Man, this is a problem. I can tell just by looking at anyone's face. Your face tells me you're a pilferer. Right? See what I'm saying? It's written all over her face. Yeah. I have a same feeling. Jung-ho, I'm very sick. I hope you'll answer me back when you see this text. Look, Na-kyung. If you have a cancellation, just sit there and stay put. You hear? You guys are no good. You just make the family bigger when our space is tight. Yeah, I get it. Hi. Oh, hi. Been a long time. This is the girl I was talking about. Pretty, right? Hi. Your family still in the same place? Yeah. Of course. Then make some good use of it. What do you mean? You can touch up your place. So you can entertain a lot of guests. I can help you. I know someone who can do it. Bullshit. We don't do that kind of thing. It's up to you, I was just making a suggestion. Hey, stop making that sort of proposal. You know I don't make my kids do that sort of thing. Excuse me, should I go wait in the car? Yeah, you do that. Thanks for the intro, sis. See you. Okay, keep in touch. Hey look. Isn't she a little over arrogant? Not at all, she knows the ins-and-outs of our work. She'll be very useful. Hi. Hey, Ji-su. Hey, Dae-Po. You're the new one? - No way. - Why are you here? Awesome. You guys know each other? We were schoolmates. - Hi. - This is freakin' cool. - Remember Chi-hyun? - Of course. I talked to him not too long ago. You're still in touch with one another. Hold it, I'm calling him now. Here we go. You fucker, it hurt like a hell. That bastard are acting like a got damn big shot. He looks shitty. What's your name? Oh, I'm So-hyun. BAHN So-hyun. How come you are here all alone? Because I don't like to drink. So-hyun, I'm curious about something. Are we not working today either? Work? Yeah. Why keep drinking by ourselves? Oh, I don't think we're gonna do any work today. There isn't much work these days. Really? Then how can we afford a place like this? This is dad's house. That's why everybody likes it here. Oh, is that right? I really got hooked up in a wrong place. Are you here to earn money? Can there be any other reason? Why are you here for? Well, no other place would take me in. Ah... Look, this is my kid sister. She looks a bit like you, right? Really? Yeah, you guys look alike. Kinda like a tofu. So-hyun, I actually want you to ask a favor. What is it? You know my delivery job? If dad finds out, he'd want to share. Oh, so you did see me on the street. Can you keep it a secret? Yes, of course. You know what, I just saw the bundle of money in your pouch. Huh? Oh, this. This is my two years' savings. To rent a room. The money is also a secret, right? It is but no problem because I carry it all the time. I sure will keep it a secret. It fits you nicely. Pretty. This is your tee and... Hey, Eun-su. That's for you. What's this? Oh, thanks. Hey! Dae-ho, how come you don't say hi? Man, I told you to come alone. What does it matter? It'll be nice to eat together. If we all hang together like this, dad will get suspicious. Over something like this? That bastard will. Are you the house owner? Stop overreacting. It's all right. Let's just eat real quick and go. Is it really okay for me to join you? Of course. When Dae-Po was young, his peers wouldn't let him play soccer so he lacks the team spirit. But he's a good kid. Let's go. Other families don't have anything to do either. I know. That's why I want to get a room for myself. What's wrong? You just got here and you're leaving? I didn't know this family was like this. I told you she's likely to leave soon. What makes you say that? I'm not gonna leave right away. I'm just telling you in advance. How come I always find ice cream in this house? Aren't you an only kid? I think my mom knows, that we visit here on and off. Oh, she does? Shit, I won't have any. I feel guilty. You know what, sis? Yes? When you get a room, can I join your family? What do you mean? I mean, if it's all right with you. But I'm not creating a family. I'll just live with my kid sister. She's just freeloading at my aunt's place. Oh, I see. Sorry. I thought you're going to have a family. You can come visit me often. Okay. By the way, still no word from that guy you talked about? Oh... Is there anyone who can reach him? There is a place he used to work at. But I don't know. So-hyun. You don't like being with this family, right? No, I don't. Then go find him instead of waiting for him. You don't understand. My situation is different from yours. But why do you bring him up all of a sudden? Oh, because you talk about him a lot. You say this because you find me burdensome. That's not it, So-hyun. I know. I'm really good at catching things like this. Ji-su started playing alone, as soon as she got here. How often was she out at this time? Maybe she is doing a part time job. That's not too cool. She should tell us, right? Hey, do you know anything? Anyhow, she needs some discipline. Solidarity is important for us. I want you all to cooperate. Now you show up. Well. Where are you wandering about everyday? Sorry. I'll get ready right away. This is a regular motel room for you. Excuse me? You come and go as you please. She doesn't care about what I say. Hey, come on over here and sit down. Let me just put my stuff down first. No, come sit here immediately. Okay? What's eating him? Something going on, So-hyun? Yes. Yes? Hey, you know what this is, right? What's that? Like you know nothing. What? Wow... you're a regular thief. Don't pretend you don't know. It's money for our daily expenses. What do you mean? That's news to me. Oh yeah? But it's fuckin' strange. Money's been slowly missing after you joined us. You know what I'm saying? In our family, dammit, everybody trust each other. No one would touch this money but you. We all know I leave it open on purpose. But this happens as soon as you join us. I won't tolerate this. What do you want me to do? What are you staring at me like that? You crazy? Show a little humility. Look, dad. Don't get mad. Just tell me what I have to do. What do I need to do? Should I make up for the amount missing? How much is gone? Hey, this isn't about money. So stop running your fuckin' mouth. When something like this happens, we handle it our way. I'll make you pay for it. Well, I don't like it. What did you say? This is your initiation rite? This is driving me nuts. Some people still do such a silly thing. Hey, you. Just stop it. I said I'd pay you. How much? Huh? What's wrong with you? You're such a cocky bitch. How come? Fuck, over half the money's gone. Huh? Huh? Is that gonna be okay? Huh, is it? Why, is it too much? So-hyun, did they do this to you too? Is this how they are? Wow, this is a pit. Listen. So-hyun and I are leaving this place. But I'll make up for the missing amount. That will do, right? Hey, sit down. No, I have nothing more to say. Let's just settle for that. Sit down! Hey, So-hyun, hurry and go pack. Okay, So-hyun. Go pack your stuff. I'll take care of the rest. He said all I have to do is make up for the missing amount. I know how these guys operate. I know them through and through. You got damn bitch. What the hell are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Hey, stop fooling around. What are you doing? Hello? Um, Madame BAEK? We too wanna do what you proposed earlier. So how do we do it? Ah! Fuck! Hey, you think doing this will make you a big shot? You're good for nothing. No one thinks of you as a human being. You think the kids will stick around if you don't have this house? They're here because you have a house. You fucking idiot. You know nothing. Yeah, you guys are all the same. I want you all to drop dead. Dae-Po. Can't you go talk to dad? That son of bitch won't listen to me. What if something happens to you or Jjong-gu? So what? We'll take a beating. Or else we'll have to go find another family. This is not a good solution. Hey, you gonna keep pissing me off? What did I say? Then what? Do nothing? You don't care about Ji-su? It's not that. If you and Jjong-gu go, I'll be left alone. That's what scares me. You're a selfish brat. I'm just wasting my breath. What I mean is... Hey, Dae-Po. It's been a while. What are the bats for? You starting baseball again? Yeah, so I don't lose the feeling. When do you need them back? Keep them. I don't use them anyway. Oh, yeah? Thanks. Gotta go. See you later. Okay. Hey, just the two of us will go first. You come later at night. Dae-Po, you played baseball? That jerk used to be a fucking rookie. He's so arrogant now. Why are you out here? Hey, don't go in. Huh? None of the guys are home right now. There's something going on tonight, so come back later. Why? Hey, you didn't hear anything? What? About Dae-Po and Jjong-gu? Anything happened to them? Never mind. Hey, do you... Do you also feel like killing me and leave? Shit, what the hell... I feel so shitty. You know what, dad? What if you just let Ji-su out of the room. I think everything will be okay, then. The next customer has arrived. Go bring him. When mom and I were still living here, that old man would come by around this time. He made the security deposit on this house. She'd then pretend to be real sorry to me. But then, she'd ask me to go some place and wait there. You know, in the middle of the night. And, fuck, I was a minor. Can you stop talking about that? Why do you talk about that again in a situation? You really irritate me. Shit, don't I make sense? Hey. You say something. Back when... Back when I was living in a motel with Jung-ho... Man, so fuckin' annoying. Let's go over there. Hey, hold it there. How come you guys act like this? I know what you're thinking. Let's not act like this. This is Ji-su's money. Let's think of it as a gift and start all over again. I really want to make a freakin' safe family. Huh? Dae-hoon. Suk-hwan. Huh? You crazy bitch, let go of me! Crazy bitch, you wanna die? Let me go! Let me go. Hey, you come over here. Hey, let go of me! Hey, how much do you want? Hey you, take this. We all did this together. Get that? So we divvy it up fair and square. Understand? I'm sorry but... Can I have Ji-su's pouch? This? Why? I just feel like having it. You're not cut out to be a member of this kinda family. Go find yourself a shelter. Stop being a fool. Hi. How are things? I'm doing all right. You may not care. But I went to the motel. I mean the motel where Jung-ho abandoned me and took off. But I don't want to go into a great detail about him. Except that I wanna say I was at the motel like a fool. I thought maybe someone would be there. Someone to take me somewhere. New World We're not open yet. Oh? I know her. I'm So-hyun. Jung-ho's friend. This is for you. He came by once after he quit. He left this here then. Hey, got any place to stay? If you don't, come to my place after I get done. You can stay for a night. You know where Jane is? Huh? You remember her? She liked Jung-ho. Yeah, she did. You both were passionate about him. But no one knows where she is now. Is that so? Ah... It was right around when Jung-ho quit. Jane quit too soon thereafter. No one can get in touch with her now. She disappeared. You live alone? Well. I used to live with my mom but now I live alone. Where is your mother? Mom? She died not too long ago. I'm sorry but you'll have to sleep in the living room. Okay? Sis. Joo-hee. From Dae-Po Ji-su, where the hell are you... Please call or text or something. Hang in there, Ji-su. We're coming for you. I've been to New World, too. I came to write this letter recalling someone at New World. Jane. That's her name. Hello? Is this Dae-po's phone? This is Ji-su. Did you erase my number? Are you listening? Where are you? Jane liked Jung-ho. She said to everybody that she was his lover. "Every night in my dreams, Jung-ho and I are lovers." "That's good enough. As long as I believe so." Hello. Hi, Jjong-gu. You don't look happy to see me. Did you come alone? Ji-su told me to go ahead first. She said she would come along soon. Do you like your new family? Hey, BAHN So-hyun, cut it. What? What are you doing right now? What do you mean? What's this crap you're giving me? I had a hunch that it was you. But how could you call me pretending to be Ji-su? Have you really gone crazy? Where's Ji-su? What? I said, where's Ji-su? I don't want to talk to you long so just tell me. I know everything already. You're the only one left. Na-kyung and them assholes can't be reached. I'd already heard everything from them. You were with them when they buried Ji-su. I even know you guys divvied up Ji-su's money. Right? Fuck, to be honest, I want to kill you all. You get what I'm saying? What really gets me is you. Can't believe how come you do this. Ji-su was so good to you! Now, how can you act like this? So hurry up and say it. Where did you bury Ji-su? I'm so sorry, Dae-Po. You may not believe me. But I was going to tell you everything when I see you. I was afraid you wouldn't see me if you knew who I was. You wouldn't speak to me again if I told you about Ji-su. That's why I lied. I don't wanna hear your story. Just tell me where Ji-su is. Right now! Don't know how. How I can be with other people. I just don't know how. I did a lot of thinking, today. Now I have no other choice but this. Sometimes I remember Jane standing on a stage. On that particular day, it seemed that she sang for me. It could be my misunderstanding, but that's what I believe. For that was the first and last time I saw her on stage. Turn around. What? I said, turn around. Count to a hundred. Just count to a hundred. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Eun-su! Let's go! Are you curious why I wrote this letter? Are you by any chance curious where I am and what I'm doing? Actually, I am alone again now. All the dreamlike moments are gone. Everything will go back to the way it used to be. Back to when there was no one to listen to my story and nobody to tell me their story. Sis, is Jung-ho here? Yeah, he's brought somebody. Somebody? Who? Don't know. A kid sister of somebody. A kid sister? Drink. Now go home. Alright. I'll stay just a little longer. Go. Quick. Alright. I'll just be here. Please, go. Otherwise I'll be in trouble. I'll wait until you get done. Never mind. Just go. Hey. Hey, you! Come over here. Hello. Welcome. Oh, you're so pretty. Hello. You're so pretty. Oh, what a big crowd today? Before I sing today, I wanna share a story about myself. Is that okay with you? Yes! The moment I was born I was not truthful. The first word I uttered was a lie. You could say that my songs were a record of false history. Do you get it? This bugger here. That's what I'm talking about. People believe only what they see is truth. So my existence has always been false. People pointed their finger at me saying whatever I said was not trustworthy. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to be with people. You know, everybody I loved left me. Some of them said, "No one will ever love you." "You love someone to have him love you, that's why." That's how I've lived my life till now. Believing that one day, my truth will shine through. Of course, my lonely life won't change easily. Nor will my unhappiness, it will continue forever. It's okay, though, because I have happy days like this. An occasional happy day like this will do for me. So now, let's not die but live long unhappily. And let's meet again next year and the following year. With unhappy faces. Here at New World. Show me your hand. While writing this letter, something new occurred to me. Jane mustered up courage to sing a song for me. Even if... nobody believes me. This is not an absolute lie, though.
