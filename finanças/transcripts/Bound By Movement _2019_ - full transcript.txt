Day one. Oh my God. This is gonna be an adventure. Let's go! Shakazuka! I think when I first started to imagine what this tour could be, I honestly would have to say it was this idea of promoting this pro-signature model shoe that we were releasing and the idea originally was like, all right, let's just travel around with hundreds of shoes in the bus and just try to build the culture of getting these athletes around the world to buy the shoe. Unfortunately, but kind of fortunately, we had a setback and we weren't happy with the product that we were making and we kept wear testing and it pushed us so far that we didn't have shoes ready for the tour. With that being said, I had already set up 17 events around the USA and I wanted to continue to keep that momentum. I didn't want to push it back, I didn't want to cancel anything. So, the next best thing and actually the real best thing was just using it, using it as a way to build a community and connect with people that maybe I never really had a chance to connect with before. Right now we are picking up Marcus Zyrken! Marcus, always filming, you're always filming. And Doctor Richard Ferreday. I thought you guys said you were getting water. It's day one of the Lace Up Tour, we're heading to the tour bus right now, we've got all our stuff packed. And we're about to get on the road for 63 days. Let's go. Oh my God! - Oh my God! - It's Sydney Olson! - Whooh, hi! My name is Sydney Olson. I'm originally from Seattle, Washington, but I live in Los Angeles. I'm 25 years old, and I'm a professional free runner. You ready for this? Yes! That did not sound very confident. There he is! My name is Jeff Garrido. I'm 23 years old, from Folsom, California, which is like Sacramento. That's it, baby. Two more people joining us, Robert Kirkland, our physio. Hey! - Hey! You ready to do this? No. - Let's do it. - No. George! What's up, man? Thanks dude. Welcome back. Almost ready to hit the road, baby. We now had two goals for the tour, post events that bring communities together and make a really dope film. But it was almost like the film and the tour were two different things, and one of the goals of the film was to shoot in unique locations all around the U.S. no matter how hard they were to get to. Right now, we're trying to head to a abandoned ghost town from the Gold Rush era. But the road is a little rough. Woo! I really don't know what I expected to see when I came to Bodie. Just a lot of old houses, I suppose. Well, Bodie had 'em. Some were standing, but leaning. Some were leaning a little bit more. The caretakers had the planters, and their bosses got on very well, all things considered. That was one of the last automobiles that had any call for it. It kind of gives you an idea. Like all mining towns, Bodie has had a lot of fires. That's the machine they used to fight the fire. And that's like my favorite part about going out to these different locations, is that this obstacle is nothing that any of us has ever been able to try to train on. So it lends itself to, like, a little bit more of a creative process. It's still shiny and new looking. Maybe that's because of the work out it got. They didn't have any mining disasters in Bodie, no cave-ins or anything like that. No, I really can't say what I expected to find in a ghost town. But certainly not people. Yo, we got a park ranger. What just happened? We just got a citation for filming without a permit. Kind of cool, I don't know how much it's gonna cost, $1,000? 500, 5, 50, 500? Who knows? Let's get the out of here. What was that? Literally, where are we? - Apple's Lake? - Apple's Lake? There's a big old lake right there, and a bunch of mountains. There's snow around us. S'no way. What's crazy to me is that I've been working on this for a year and a half. Dream of having a full tour bus, bunk beds and everything and like seeing it in locations like this one is, like, sort of surreal. And every time I look back as we're walking away from the bus, it's like this moment of, It feels good, so I'm gonna take a picture. One of the ways in which we decided to keep the tour stress-free was just to go with the flow. So, that night we all decided to get tattoos. We did it! - Good stuff. - I'm freaking out. - I'm freaking out. - It's just a tattoo. - I'm now freaking out. - It's your first tattoo, it's fine. It might not come out good. It doesn't matter. It's not like it's almost midnight. Got his first tattoo. After a late night getting tattoos we all enjoyed an incredible meal prepared by Jeff's family before heading to our next location, Woodward, Tahoe. Hi. - Hi. My name's Jesse La Flair, we're here with the Lace Up Tour for the Parkour Week. Okay perfect. Let's see what happens, three, two, one. Yokohamas! Have taken us to Woodward, Tahoe. Woodward, the largest action sports camp in the world invited us out to go train and shoot at each one of their locations while on tour. And we couldn't pass up this opportunity. This is also where our pro roster began to grow. Erik's here! My name's Erik Mukhametshin. Originally I was born in Uzbekistan, and then I moved Russia and I lived there for about 10 years or something. Just to have fun, be with all my friends. - Hey! - Oh, I'm so glad, man. - Poor guy. - I finally made it. Nothin' like sitting at airport for three hours waiting. All right, this is my first time here at Woodward, Tahoe. And there are so many cool features. Like, look at this. What is going on? They just put in new rails. This bar set up is so sick. What? Dude, I am really excited about this. This is the type of spot that inspires me to try to, like, explore some really interesting lines and use the space in a way that I couldn't do somewhere else. Oh! You know. So far, the training has been amazing. Training with the guys has been great. I'm definitely pushing myself, while being pushed by everybody else, and that's just a great combination in my book. - You're not allowed to do anything else, unless you get this move right. - Oh! - That's what I was afraid of. I think I can make it, though. I think you can make it, dude. Yeah! - Yep. - No! - That was close. - That was so much better, I couldn't land it! I thought I was going to 'cause I was really high in the air. - Yep. - Oh! No! Dude, I got so freaked out! I kicked the tree a lot that time. Did you see that, just, this twist? Yeah, that was, you were, oh! That was like a uh-oh-twist. - Good? - Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, man. Are we doing something else? That's what's so great about it, is that we're here together, and we're pushing each other. So, when I get people like Erik Mukhametshin in here, teaching me new moves, it's quite a, it's actually kind of a scary feeling for me. I have to learn to work past it, but just the idea that someone believes in me that much, it makes me want to work harder. 'Cause he'll tell me to do something, and I, I'm like, ah, I don't know if I can do that. But then I work on it and I try it, and eventually I'll get it. - Never worn a thong? - No! You don't have to only wear that, you can still wear your pants. Yeah, you get to wear pants over it. - For how long? - Four hours. Four hours? Um, I really don't want to do it, one and 10. - Ready? - No, I'm ready, all right. Here we go, - Three, two, one, - three, two, one... While playing the odds, if you guess the same number as someone who just odds'd you, you have to do that dare. - Eight. - 10. Oh! I'm only telling you this because odds are, you're going to see us play a lot throughout this film. So last night got a little crazy. None of it got filmed. Oh my gosh! But it's okay, it's better that way. We're doing a hot-swap. No stopping. All right. Don't bump the wheel, whatever you do. Yeah. We are in an RV park. I guess tomorrow morning we going to wake up in front of a beautiful lake. We passed a bridge that we think we saw a rope swing on, so you guys can... I think some of my favorite moments of the tour were just the adventures that would unfold from the openness of, like, pulling over, or just not having such a solid plan that we blocked something magical. All right, so we found a bridge right as the sun was going down yesterday, as we drove into this place. And someone thought they saw a rope. So we're going to go see if we can rope-swing it. Otherwise we'll shoot some video on the bridge itself, because it looked pretty cool. Sick. Whee! You nailed that one, bro. This worked out, huh? "Hey, let's try to sleep over by the dam." No, that didn't work. "Oh, let's drive 20 more minutes, there, "it looks like there might be an RV park." Well, that didn't exist. "Hey, let's park here for the night. "Oh, look at that bridge!" That's, like, the journey we're on, randomly getting cool shit to happen while we're doin' this. My two standouts has gotta be Erik and Sydney, I think. Erik's someone who always comes off as this kind of cocky bastard. But he can always back up what he's being cocky about. He'll say, "I'm going to do this," and he literally always does it. Next shot, we're going to drive the tour bus over that bridge, and Erik's gonna jump while it's moving off the top and into the water. - Yeah, let's go. - Here we go! - Oh my God, he wiped out! - What? - Yo! - Yo, get him! Help, help, help! - Ooh! - Come in. Sounds like a solid head hit. Little, little concussion, probably. - Whooh! - Oh yeah. At that point, we were only 12 days into the tour out of 63, so, for something to happen that early on was kinda, was kind of crazy, but if anyone could've taken that hit and walked away from it essentially, it was definitely Erik. Don't remember anything, that's so annoying. This was the first time on tour where we realized, when things go wrong, it happens extremely fast and with no warning. But we had to get back on the road, we had a whole tour ahead of us. Geez! My name is Nate Weston. I am 21 years old. I am from Seattle, Washington, and I've been training parkour for just under six years. What initially attracted me to the sport is how free it is, and how you can really express yourself through movement, and there's no real boundaries at all, there's nothing you need to do, or need to buy or anything, and you can just train whenever you want, and I think that's just the most amazing part about training, is being able to do it whenever you want. Dude, you've outdone yourself, this is so nice! He's so excited for odds, right now, that he just... - No! - Ask Jeff all about it. - Let's just say, Nate, I did not have a good week, man. I've been seeing some gnarly stuff goin' down. Welcome to tour! Look! It's Joey! - Whaddup! - Joey, you're our first VIP! - Oh my God! My name's Joey Adrian. I've been training for about nine years, maybe a little less, maybe a little more, and I'm from Portland, Oregon. The thing that really brought me into parkour and, like, solidified that this is what I wanted to do, is this was the first thing where I felt that I can get good at whatever I want, if I just practice it. And that was the first thing that I realized that for, so I just, like, ran with it. It's pretty lit! - Are you going with them on tour? - You wanna have me on for a little bit? - You want to just jump on... - Dude! - Are you coming with us? Yeah! - That's how it happens! - That's how it goes, man. - Where are we at? - We are at the zoo in Portland, and we just parked the tour bus, and apparently, it's so big that I need to pay for five spots. But the machine's not working. Stoked, man! It's also just exciting to have everybody, you know, in Portland, at the spot... - at the spot where you're training. - Yeah, exactly. - That's cool - 'Cause that doesn't ever, Woo hoo! Thank you. - Oh! - Whooh! I can definitely do that. At some point I thought I'm not going to rotate enough, I was like, "I'm screwed." - Oh my God! That was disgusting. Yeah! That's a wrap on Portland, baby! - Odd'ed to 5. - Ready? Three, two, one, - One, Four! - Four! My God! Oh my God! Maybe there's some more. - Mm mm, mm mm. Let's go, let's go, I think I'm going to throw up. I mean, there's very few people out there that can get a tour bus and tour around the country, for all summer, that's pretty insane. And he had a very powerful voice as well. And I'm really, really thankful for what he's doing with this whole tour, because it's just showing that there's so much more you can do with movement, and there's so many lives you can affect through this simple sport, and I think it's super empowering. I didn't know, basically, anything about how this tour was getting set up or anything. And then, talking with Jesse, knowing that he's basically fronting all the money for this, realizing that our first gas stop, it was like 200-and-some dollars to fill it up. And I was just like, wait, what? You're paying 200 plus dollars every time we stop for gas, just so that you can spread these good vibes and bring these high-level athletes to these communities. Because the movement's one thing, but that only goes so far. We already have insane athletes, but we don't have a lot of people that are going out and actually making opportunities happen. So, seeing Jesse do that has been massively inspiring to me. None of us had ever seen Mount Rushmore in person before. So we all decided it would be a dope place to go and get some cool shots. Starting route to Mount Rushmore National Memorial. We could feel that we were causing too much attention, and decided it was time to leave. But right when we thought it was safe, the cops pulled me aside. Not just one , but two tickets later, meant it was time to leave. More about, like, the interpersonal dynamic between you three. You became kind of like the Three Musketeers, in a way. I know, it's crazy. Have you grown as friends, do you think? Oh yeah, for sure, I've known Joey for just about as long as I've been training, because he lives in Portland and I live in Seattle. When I first started training, he was literally one of the first famous or professional parkour athletes that I knew at the time, I'm like, "Oh, that's Joey!" and when I met him, it was just such a crazy thing, because he just was a regular dude, and I was just this kid kinda looking up to him. And to be able to be training with him now, as well as with Erik, to be able to be training with them, and at a similar level, and just having a good old time, and being friends, has been really, really fun. And I definitely got to know Erik a lot more this trip, which has been really a blessing as well, because he was one of the first people I really watched and studied. Three, two, one, one! - Two, one, one! Nate has to take a picture of the waitress, but with the flash on, and it takes forever. - Whoa! - Sorry. Thank you very much. Get that for ya. - Whaddup! - What's up! I'm Mich Todorovic. I'm from Montreal, Canada, and I've been doing parkour for 14 years. Todorovik's ready now, too, so it doesn't matter, right? Hey bro. - How's it going, man? I mean, I was always a super active kid, when I was young, and basically, I couldn't afford to play all the team sport. I kind of sacrificed school for parkour. At some point, I was like, you know what? I have no idea why I want to keep going to school, if I don't know what I want to do. And I knew that parkour was my main focus. So I said, you know what? I'm gonna drop school. I'm going to do parkour is much as I can. With Mich now on board, we drove off to a spot that we'd all been waiting for. Where do you want to start? This park's insane. It's almost, like, too much to do. I don't know, what do you want to start with? There's a hella glass on this ground, so... Yeah, I know, there was hell a glass over there too. Today's shoot location is called Grand Fountain here in Flint, Michigan. It's easily one of the best spots not only in the USA, but in the entire world. I guarantee you that today it goes down. - Okay? - Yeah. He's chillin'. Sit down. Be gimbal! That was so, how did you do it? Let's go! Mich can do magical things. After that pretty intense film day, we all decided that some relaxation was in order. So we drove off to Caesar Creek Lake in Ohio to spend the night. Oh yeah. Turn around. Turn around. - Ooh! - Oh! - Oh! - Aw, that smells so bad! - Ready? - Three, two, one. Oh my God! One and five. Who's going to go first? Loser has to take some of that mud, and stick it in their mouth. You first, right? - Mmm, no. Three, two, one, two! - Two! - Ya done! - Yes, Jesse! - Yes! - Oh my, - There it is. - Yes, show us. Git it, git it! - Oh! - What are you doing? Oh my God, put your mouth in the water! It's still on your tongue, we can see it! Oh my God! So I love free-running more than anything in the entire world. It's brought me to places that I never would've expected that I'd get to go. And I've gotten to travel to so many different places in the world, and I've met so many amazing people through this. Being on tour has been the most fun I've ever had in my entire life. And it's not necessarily just the training. It's the friendship, and it's the going out in the water and throwing mud at each other, constantly playing the odds game with each other, and doing some really dumb stuff because of it. It really has been such an amazing adventure. Rob lost the odds and he has to shave his head. Here we go. All right, I think we're good! On the outskirts of Chicago, we found there was this abandoned mill or something. Got graffiti all over it, we did see some security in there, and signs that say no trespassing. But at this point, we are going to try to go in and scout it, and see what happens. So, fingers crossed. Let's check it out. Hoping to get off some shots before we get kicked out. Ready. - Rolling? - Rolling! Yes! I actually got a pretty bad nail stuck in my bone, I couldn't get it out of there, it was so stuck, so I just, how did I not see it? - Ah! Oh, there's security, we gotta go. He told us to leave, I don't think he called the cops. But I'm not going to celebrate, until we get back to the bus! Fingers crossed. I'm gonna scare Sydney right now. - Snake! - Oh watch, Sydney! What was that? Something weird, it's really hard to explain, it should be something really different to all the things that I've already done. It's hard to explain, I don't know. Let's say there are two walls next to each other, with a good distance, but I could cut 180 to a front flip or something like that, like some weird stuff. It's just hard, like, most of the time, I'm just finding something really weird, and I'm like, "Whoa, I wonder if that will work?" And I'll just spend, like, a couple of hours trying it. - Oh my God! - Oh my God! Yo, that bar is jello. - Oh! - Oh my God! - Yep! - Come on! I am Corbin Reinhardt and I'm from Los Angeles, California. I started off as a student and now I'm a pro free runner. Well, the reason I wanted to come on this tour is because, obviously, it's parkour free running, which is, like, one of my favorite things to do. But also, all the stops that you're going to are places that I've wanted to do before I even did parkour, like Woodward, I've seen that since I was a kid, so it's kind of been on this pedestal, I never thought that I would ever actually be there, but now the idea of coming as a pro is a really cool thing to me. Dude! Jesse's one of the sickest cameramen I've ever seen. The first time I saw Jesse bust out the Red and film one of my lines, I was just expecting to be like, "Oh look, "I can see the line, it's on a nice camera, cool." But no, he gets every single angle perfect! He's in the exact right spot so that he's not in my way. He's filming the exact thing that you need to see in the movement. And that's not something that it's easy to do. And then seeing him film, like, Erik do a line, or Nate do a line, or Sydney do a line, Jesse somehow has this super tight view, but doesn't miss anything in the whole picture. And it's been incredible. I knew there was something because I saw George filming. Oh! I believe it's in my DNA. I love to challenge myself, I love to, to be the best me I can. And I was like that in soccer, I was like that when I used to play basketball, when I used to skate or whatever. Whatever I did, I always wanted to kind of improve myself as much as I could. Whoosh! Being with Erik and Joey all the time has been pretty crazy, they're both kinda nuts. They always, they're wanting to train all the time. I'm more of a person that likes to kind of take some rest days in between. But they're always just kinda go, go, go. And it definitely showed me on this tour, it showed me that you can train every day as long as you're really doing rehab and stuff. But, yeah, the combination of them, going to these new spots and seeing these new communities, and training with all of these new people, just kinda brings this fire in them, and I see it, and then it gets me all excited, and I just want to train as well, so it just kinda happens. - Oh my God! - Dude, you made that look... - So easy! - So simple! After some much-needed rest and a couple of card games later, we got back on the road. But not before picking up the rock star himself. He's playing at the playground. Oh my God! - Bart Van Der Linden! - What's up, guys. - So sweaty! - Come here! One of my favorite things about the parkour community is getting to have friends from literally all around the world, and how, as pro's, we get to hang out and train together in different countries throughout the year. But every time we see each other, it's like seeing family again. So. - Whaddup. - Oh, it's chill in here. - Hey, dude. We finally made it to New York City but we only had four hours to go before we had to get back on the bus. So we jumped on a train got right into it. Goin' to Times Square, baby! You gotta love this place. New York City! Rock 'n roll. Wow! He's not very good at this. Three, two, one! While on the road, we had a group of athletes reach out nearby. So we posted up on social media, saying that we'd stop in, have an impromptu jam. New pair of shoes. New pair of feet. That's how I feel right now. We are in West Hartford. Got my bodyguard with me, big Mich. We're doing a meet and greet. We going to say hi to some locals, and see if anyone's out here. Hi, you met me before, actually. How are you? Oh, good. - I am really nervous right now. The police are here! I don't know what we're gonna do. Right as things got going, a bunch of cops showed up. Luckily for us, the West Hartford parkour community has a great relationship with their local authority, and they actually allowed us to continue to train. That was dope, though, good job! How'd it come out? - What did you just get? - Got some books, you know. - Oh, nice. - Wait, where'd you go? - The library. - Like, "Where did Mich go?" Oh, he's just buying some books. Oh, Barnes & Noble. Wow, you're so attractive, in so many ways. Jesse La Flaire Jesse Oh yeah! Yo, yo, we're on the Lace Up Tour, you never knew, we're going to a city near you! I'm comin', gonna go through! Today's stop was one of the most unique locations of the tour. Sidney and I's Team Yokohama teammate, Travis Pastrana, allowed us to stop by the famed Pastranaland to do whatever we wanted. And for some of us, this was even a bigger dream come true than for others. You just put in the code? Ha ha ha! Check that out. Oh My God! Being at Pastranaland was huge for me, it was massive. Whenever anybody asks a parkour guy, "How did you get into parkour, did you see a YouTube video "or something like that?" For me, it was Pastranaland. I used to watch videos on that since I was five to 10, and it actually made me get up and go to do what I wanted to do. Especially at that time, as motocross, I just wanted to go out and I wanted to explore, I wanted to really find things. Dude. this is insane. I've spent so much time, just watching this foam pit in my life. It was also Travis Pastrana's house. And I thought to myself, that would be the coolest place to really go, to be at, to get better at. And I never thought I would be there. But then, when you told me that this was going to be on the tour, I really, it really amped me up, I would say. Because it was one of those things that I kind of put in the past, saying that it wasn't going to happen, and now it's happening. And so that was really, really cool to me. Whooh, Team Yokohama, baby, we're at Pastranaland, let's go! It was nice to jump around, I found some descents and stuff. But really, when I got there, all I saw was the things that were iconic, like the foam pit, all the ramps and everything, it was kind of like tingling in the back of my head, I needed to get on a bike, and I needed to just find something to do a back flip on. 'Cause that was one of the main things I've ever wanted to do. This dude's been riding motocross bikes since before I was born and winning prizes at it. He's better at riding a motorbike than I am at walking. That's the dream right there. X Games, baby. - Are you filming? - Yeah. Okay, so we got Lindsey Pastrana's bike right here, and I'm going to be sending some back flips into this. Bart's about to go for his first back flip right now. Go, Bart! Missed the pedal! - What just happened? - Whooh! Well, that was the scariest thing that can happen, so, - Yeah! - Oh my God! What? When we went on the inside, it was really cool to actually see that little foam pit, because I've always seen that, and you have everything around you, which is pretty cool, but it's kind of small. So doing that back flip was really awesome. The real deal was the outside. That was the big foam pit, that was the one that I have laid my childhood on. So I really wanted to hit a double back flip out there. All right ladies and gentlemen, anybody who knows Travis Pastrana's house knows that all of the stuff goes down right here. I really wanted to hit that double back flip first try. All right, so that first try did not go so well. The second one was much better. - Where we at? - We're at Pastranaland, baby. Insane in the membrane, baby, oh my God! So, the bottom line of Pastranaland was we did not have long enough. That place was so, I would even say historical, for me, that I just needed to be there, and I needed to really feel it, and we got a lot of that done that day. But in terms of just being there and being in that place, it felt like what a kid feels for Disneyland, if they saw it for, you know, years and then they went there. That was the kind of feeling that I had a my stomach. Oh! Yeah! - It's so good. Corbin's a legend. Every day of the Lace Up Tour was ridiculously fun. But a 63-day adventure doesn't come without some bumps and bruises. Oh! Oh! Oh! Dude, I hit the tree branch! Oh! Oh! Ow! Oh my favorite pink shorts. Oh! - 14. - Oh! Oh, my, don't! Oh, I knew I was gonna die. Uh! You know what? I do love get injured once in a while. Because it just brings you back, and you can sit and kind of re-focus and rearrange your system. And every time I get injured, I feel like I take care of myself even more. I want to get in the game as fast as I can, so I'm like, I need to be super efficient. So, I kinda enjoy getting injured once in a while. Watch out. Nate, I just got kicked out, but roll the Red cam. I got one more thing that I want to do before I go. Miami might've been the perfect location for some training at the beach. But unfortunately, at our next stop, Orlando, the tour was going to take a turn for the worse. It's this inevitable truth. It's like, every day we go out and we do gnarly stuff, and we push the limits of what the human body is physically capable of. We are playing the game of odds. Eventually, something is going to happen, and when we get comfortable is when it gets dangerous. I was back in another corner of the gym, shooting Mich. And just before I stopped recording on the camera, that's when I heard the slam. And just based on the overall reaction that everyone gave, I just knew it probably wasn't good. - Oh! - Oh! Get Rob! Lay him out flat! - Can someone call 911? - His neck, his neck. He went straight in, his neck, - Call 911. - Let him breathe. - Seeing Corbin on the ground like that was, uh, a bit of a struggle for me. You know, on one hand, you want to help someone who's clearly not okay. And on the other hand, you kinda have this job to do. - Corbin, you breathing? - Corbin. - As long as he's breathing, - Yeah. - Check his - No, Corbin, stay down. I need you to stay down, Corbin. - Okay, okay, okay. - There you go. No, no, no, no, Corbin, stay down. Stay down, Corbin. Was there any loss of consciousness? Watching Corbin go down in Orlando was, was a shock to the entire crew and the tour and all the athletes. I think seeing how fragile our bodies can be and how a head injury can, like, put a huge hold on your life, having to sit in front of him at the ER, you know, just passed out, and now dealing with him trying to learn to speak again is like this thing that pauses me to reflect in a way that I've never had to look at myself in a way before. I felt a personal responsibility with this tour being created by me and the guilt of Corbin getting injured. I didn't know what to do, it didn't feel right leaving him, but we had to keep moving. After Corbin's injury, it just so happened that some of the other athletes were scheduled to leave tour. So, it was just down to Sydney and I, and we had one more city to hit before we started to head home. This tour taught me a lot. I learned never to take life for granted, and that it will always throw obstacles in your way. But it's how you react and overcome those challenges that dictate your future. And the way Corbin handled his injury will forever inspire all of us. I don't know, I guess it's kind of a blank space. You know, it's weird having that black, black dark space where I just don't know what happened, because I know it's there, I've seen footage, and it's just not there, it's not there in my head. I felt like I was normal, I felt like I was talking, I could talk to people, but then I found out a long time afterward, it was probably months after, that what I was saying wasn't correct. What I was saying wasn't even close to correct. Everything I was doing was gibberish. But yeah, I took speech therapy for two months. After that I had physical therapy, and so I had to get my legs back. Anytime I tried to lift my foot, it would be very hard to go from my brain to my foot. So I would try to do this but it just wouldn't happen. And I was just looking at my legs, like, "Come on. "We can do this." And, uh, yeah, it didn't happen for a long time. I think it's something that needed to happen, I think it's something that had to happen, and now I'm kinda better because of it. - Oh! - Yeah! We can travel and explore foreign lands. We can start teams and build brands to fund our endeavors. We can create competitions and host our own events to support the sport from the inside out. We can pack a giant purple tour bus full of pro athletes and tour an entire country for two months. We can do whatever we want. But none of it is why we come together. In the end, when we're training, together or alone, none of that stuff matters. Only the essence, the moment, the movement, and the memories. I don't know, the tour's amazing, man, who wouldn't want this life? It's the best life, and it's, it's doing good things. Simple as that. It's kind of strange to be in this place where I've completely met my life goal, where I could make a career out of this and just focus on this and nothing else. And it's brought so much happiness to my life that I never could've gotten from anything else. To be on this tour, it's, it's first of all, that friendship. It's sharing those moments with the people I love, that's it. - It's tour life, - Tour life! - Oh God! - Ah! I'm so grateful for this opportunity to be able to travel around America, wake up in a new city, see new people, see new spots, and train. It's been a dream of mine for as long as I've been training. It's so sick. Yeah, and liberating. I'm very grateful for it. Every single person on the bus is ingrained in parkour, so we all train together, we all move in a similar way. Styles might be different, but the movement's still there, and some might focus more on this aspect, some might focus more on this aspect, but the movement's still the same. That's what I love about what I'm doing in my life just because I can travel and meet new people, and those people becoming not even just your friends, they're like, more like a family. And I feel like I can go anywhere pretty much in the world and just stay with someone, or find friends and just message someone and just meet up and do some cool and fun stuff, you know? So yeah, I guess our sport isn't terrible. The one thing that's really nice about especially the tour itself, is the idea that wherever we are, I still kinda come back to my own, I still kinda come back to normal, and I'm gonna do free running, we're all gonna do free running. We're all going to have that one thing that connects us, together. And it's basically movement, you know? We're not just going there to sight-see. It's not a tourist-y trip. It's about doing what we love in places that we've never been. And I really like that idea. I'm crying. Travel isn't always pretty, comfortable, or painless. It changes you. It should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, reshapes your heart, and scars your body. It binds you to those you experience it with. You take something with you. And hopefully, you leave something good behind. Yeah! Oh my God! The next best thing, and actually the real best thing was just using it, using it as a way to build the community and connect with people that maybe I never really had a chance to connect with before. And I have to say that I think it was the best case scenario. What's next? Yeah. I see where you're going with this. We have this thing that we love so much, and we can share that passion together. So I guess, basically, we're bound by movement. I don't actually have to say it? Oh, thank God. Um, okay.
