You're the one that always has the tape. - Tara. - Stop it. Mom, tell them what you're doing. You know what In doing. No, mom, tell them! Oh! A little warning would be helpful, sweetheart.

You can't sound like you're selling something. - Isn’t that the point? - Yeah. But they can't know you're trying to sell them something. Right. Soft sell versus hard sell. Exactly. You're lucky In a professional. And don't say pizazz, you're not 80. Um, mom, I need all the pos, and I can't find them anywhere. Oh, don't, please, don't touch anything on Toms desk, honey. You know how he hates that. Hell be here any minute and hell help you find what you're looking for. Okay, fine. Isn’t it a little strange for you to have him here all the time? Strange? No. We've been divorced for three years. We built the business together, honey its not strange. And we know how much mom hates paperwork. With a passion. Plus, he's not here all the time. He's just here couple of hours a week running numbers. Despite the fact that he's not here anymore he loves seeing you girls. He was a good stepdad, wasn't he? He was. Some people are just better as friends. And, hey, free labor. - Wow, right on cue. - Wow, right on cue. Jinx, one two, three.

Oh, you're afraid, they're gonna think In too old for you, huh? - Well, you are 25. - Well, In not like 50. I mean, come on. But once they finally meet me, they'll fall in love with me. Are you pretty sure about that? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - Yeah? I think about you all the time. I think about you, too. When you were at the cafe this morning I wanted to come by and see you. How did you know that I was at the cafe? - Come on. - No, no. What are you talking about? You put me on find your friends. - Like a month ago, remember? - Right. I forgot about it. That was really supposed to, only be for that day. I didn't even realize that it was on. Wait, what are you doing? In turning it off. Come on. In not like some stalker dude. Just wanna know where you are. Its romantic. Well, In right here, right now. Yeah, but not for long. Yeah, the summer that we did kind of fly by. Yeah, you'll be in Rossmore in new jersey. Its not like you're in Australia. Its like a five-hour flight. - Well figure it out. - Right. In not gonna miss that. - What? - You barging in. Oh, my God. Come on. You're gonna have a bunch of roommates. It'll be good practice. Hey, are you keeping this? Why? You want it? I don't know. - I don't really remember him? - I know. I know you were really young when he died. Do you remember any of it? Some. Do you remember that day? Wait, isn't this the day that he started calling me... - Rocky? - Yes. You demanded two scoops of rocky road ice cream every time, you were obsessed. With it and with punching people. So it really worked out for you all the way around. Hey, um, these were in the guestroom closet. You want to look through them? Uh, yeah. Thanks, mom. Yeah. He would have been so proud of you. You too. Right, In gonna take these downstairs. Don't stay up too late. Got it? - Goodnight. - Love you. You take this. - You sure? - Hm-hm. Hey, I know what I said. But In gonna miss you barging in. I know. Goodnight. Alright, here we see the demands put on the CEO of a small company. Not only does she have to manage the entire business but at the same time, manages to provide sustenance to her very hungry children. Who, by the way, are old enough to cook for themselves. - Mom. - What? Its the truth. Am I famous yet? You're on your way, this one got about 1,000 likes. Which is about 300 more than the first. No way. Shouldn't you be studying? Okay, check it out, my last practice test up by 26 points. Wow, that's great. Now do you have time to tutor me again? I think its really helping. Yeah, sure, but it-its the sats. Its mainly just practice. Well, its easy for you to say when you already aced them. Honey, can't you just tutor your sister for like one hour? Mom, I have a lot of things that I have to do today. Oh, my God. Ew. This is hers. Oh. Sorry. Oh, my God. Peanut butter and pickles. Ugh. Gross. In gonna throw up. I guess In the one with a sophisticated palate. Half an hour. Half hour? Okay, half hour. Half a sandwich. Okay, question 22, please. - "C." - how? - Math. - Ha-ha. No, but seriously, how? It doesn't matter if its calculus. You need to go back to algebra textbook. Okay? Its the foundation for everything. Well, that's debatable. Um, its not debatable. Its the secret to life. Seriously, most useful book you'll ever have. I have to take this. Hurry up. You're on the clock. Chop-chop. Hey. Sorry, I've been really busy. Hey, is everything okay? In not used to not hear from you. Everything is fine, just, you know busy packing and stuff. I promise In not ignoring you. Just, you know, been thinking about what you said. And I really think we should talk in person. - Talk about what? - Hey, Ill text you. Okay? - I really gotta go. - Hold on, hold on. - Promise? - Promise. - Who's that? - No one. Everything alright? Yeah, just guys. - Well, its difficult. - Sometimes. Yeah. I-I just can't wait to get back east. You know, I know I've said it before but I really think you're gonna miss it here. The local colleges are top notch. - You could do... - Its Rossmore, Tom. I've been accepted to Rossmore. Okay, this is my dream college. No, I get it, sweetie, its just... Its just so far. In gonna miss you, that's all. Tom, In gonna miss you guys, too. But Ill be back before you know it. You know, Ill cover the full cost if you go state. Its really generous, okay, but its not the same. When you know that. Hey, this is, this is my choice. This is what I want. Hey. - Glad you could make it. - This place is nice. A little far. Why are we here? - For free stuff. - Oh. This is my friend Alex who works here. He leaves for college in a couple of days. And he looks like he's free. - Ill be right back. - Right. Hi. Oh, you were swamped earlier, so I don't want to bother you. You can't get enough of me in my uniform, can you? Well, that and the free refills. Well, In happy to see you as always. - You, too. - So, um, that's him. Oh, yeah, In just saying bye to him before I leave. But enough about me. Lets talk about you. You look good. How are you still single? Oh, you know me, I've always been very... Particular. - Maybe a little too particular. - Maybe. Oh, I just don't want my best friend on earth to end up a hermit, lonely and alone. Wow, on that note, jeez. What can I get you, maam? Shut up, you know In your biggest fan. Actually, I made you two drink special for you... ...And that guy. - Stop. - You got them? You're the best. Here you go. Best cappuccino in town. - Which friend is that? - Alex? I could've sworn, I've told you about him before. I don't like the way he looks at you. Stop. Not here. Anyway... - What's this? - Surprise. I transferred to Dobson. To Dobson community college. Yeah, the community college 20 minutes away from Rossmore. - Are you serious? - Yeah. But enrollment closed months ago. Well, I mean, not if you know how to hack the system. This is... Ryan, this is, this is too much. Okay? You... You don't move across country for someone you've been dating for a couple of months. Why not? I love you. Ryan... Ryan, we need to talk, okay? About what? You know how I feel about you. But this is college, okay? In-In always, always gonna care for you. But I need to go out and do this on my own. You'd be on your own, I thought we talked about this. Well, we-we did. But I changed my mind. And I just, I want to go and do this by myself. Okay, please, please, don't be mad. You know what? I should just go. You're not walking away from me! Ryan, let go. - You are not working out on me! - Hey, just, stop! We are over. You got a problem? But you didn't see his face. No, I couldn't see anything, he grabbed me from behind. And there's no one you know that want to do something like this? Uh, someone from school? An ex-boyfriend, a recent falling out? She doesn't have a boyfriend. No, nothing like that. In gonna put in this report, but in all honesty we don't have much to go on. - What can we do? - There's not much you can do. My guess is that it was just a random attack. A young girl alone at night. - It could have been much worse. - I realize that. And you might reconsider jogging by yourself after dark. That-that will never happen again. Anyway, Ill let myself out. Thank you. Be safe. Tell me its gonna be okay. Its gonna be okay. My love, I promise. Oh, the crowd goes wild. - Hm, that was luck. - Crowd goes wild. - Now. - Talent, straight talent. - That was pure talent. - Come on. Who's calling you? - All your friends are here. - Hilarious. Hey, In only, like, 90% of her friends. Even more hilarious. You okay? - Yeah, fine. - Is it him? Ryan? Yeah, he's having a hard time. Tara... Have you been considered that it might have been him? Of course I have. Of course. Have you told your mom about it? I don't want to talk about it, I leave soon. Fine. I get it. Okay? - I just worry about you. - Heads up! Oh. You're dead. Come and get me. Come on, loser. Try me. Try me, hit me. Can I help you with that, miss miller? Such a gentlemanly thing to do. Oh, Alex, its been so fun seeing you this summer. Hey, you want to have dinner with us tonight? I would, but I got to finish packing, I fly out tonight. - Oh. - Oh, my gosh. Stop. Okay, mom. You promise to call me when you land? Be real. Ill probably call you 50 times before I leave. - Goodbye. - Bye. See ya. Okay, post office run, then dinner. Who's in? Restaurant of my choice, right? You chose last time. - Okay. - Okay, In in. I can't, I've that dinner with Tom. But honestly, can I go with you? Sweetheart, Tom just wants to spend a little time with you before you go to college. He misses being your dad. Stepdad. Definitely misses that more than he misses being married. Please, I don't want to be lectured for the 100th time on going into school at home. Its just one dinner. And you know how much it'll mean to him. Fine. But I want you to call me right after, promise? - Okay. - I love you. I love you. Bye, dork. - You ready? - Yeah. I know. I know. It does sound fun. I fly back to college on the Redeye. Its really the last time we all get to do this. Come on. I told you, I have this dinner tonight. On a Saturday night. You're choosing dinner with a parent on a Saturday night. I wish I didn't have to. One last night out. Please. Okay, it does sound fun but I just can't. Call me Tomorrow when you land? You can count on it. Love ya. I love you. So, so you literally just in class, just slumped over... Yes, yes. Exactly. I mean, it was a sub. So how was he supposed to know I didn't have narcolepsy? Substitute teacher, easy prey. Exactly. I learned from the best. So what can I say? Where were you during all this? Chess club? Oh, come on. It was a lot better than your prank last year. Oh, its better than getting half the senior class to ditch school? Hey, guys, Ill be, Ill be right back, okay? You're-you're abandoning us? Hm-hm, yeah, yeah, for sure. Alright, relax. Its a boy. Hi, In Sharon. Yeah, he's cute though. That's alright. Its always a boy. Hey, you okay? Yeah. Don't you still think it was the right decision? Yeah, I needed to, then he got really possessive when I did. I know. I watched the whole thing. You did? Everyone in the cafe did. I mean, he got kind of intense. - Yeah. - Look. Tara, I know I should have stepped in. No, no. It just, just confirms that was the right thing to do. Obviously, Tara, I just wanted to like kill him. * works kinda slowly * - In-In glad you didn't. - Yeah. Sorry. Thank you. For keeping my secret, I mean, I knew you were the one that wouldn't judge me. Never. You're my girl. Hey, there's-there's a seat open, do you want to take it? Yeah. * Ah-ah * You know, just because were gonna be a couple hours away at college doesn't mean I have to lose my confidant. You know, everyone needs that one friend that we can confess anything to, and your priest does not count. Well, you know you can always count on me. Like, college is only two-hour flight. I will be here whenever you need me. You're the best, Alex. In gonna miss this. Most of all, I... In gonna miss you. In gonna miss you, too. Maybe I shouldn't go back. Oh, come on. Its your sophomore year. And you're flights in a couple of hours. Exactly. Tara, In not ready to leave. Alex, you can't not finish college. Look, this-this town isn't going anywhere, okay? And well both be back. You know? But if you're not going to college then you're not going anywhere, that's insane. Yeah. Yeah, I-I guess it is. Yeah. Uh... can I get you another drink? Okay. Um, one second. Damn! Hey, rusty, you good? Yeah, just give me a minute here. Come on, Tara. Hang up and hang out, okay? Party's out here. Actually, I think that I should get going. Where? Where are you going? - In going home. - Home? Wait, wait, are we still up for brunch Tomorrow? Of course. No. Of course, okay. - Okay. - Ill text you. Be safe. Love you. - Ah, hey, Alex. - Wheres Tara? Um, she actually just left. She-she left? Yeah, she left, shes going home. - Did she say why? - She seemed a little upset. I don't know, she was texting someone, maybe her mom. She was texting someone. - Okay. - Alex, everything okay? Will you just take... That's for you. - Just enjoy. - Thanks, I guess. Good morning, sunshine. Good morning. I hope you girls are hungry because I made a feast. In starving. Oh, did you make that coffee for me? Thank you so much. I did not, but go for it. Will you get Tara for me? Tara! Seriously? Would you go upstairs and get her? Thank you. - Tara. - Honey, just go get her. Honey. Tara? Upsy-daisy. Tara. Where are you? Mom. Shes not here. What do you mean shes not here? Shes not here. Her cars not in the driveway. What? Damn it, Tara. Voicemail? Her bed wasn't slept in. That means she never came home. Tom. Hell know. Hey, what's up? An early start on work. Hey, what time did Tara leave last night? - Leave where? - The restaurant. What time did Tara leave the restaurant? - She never left. - What do you mean? I mean, she never even came. She texted to say she wasn't feeling well. And wanted to reschedule. What's going on? - Oh, my God. - Janet, what happened? Tara didn't come home last night. - Where did she go? - No. I don't know. - I thought she was with you. - No. - But, mom, I just looked there. - I can't hurt to look again. Alright, lets not get ahead of ourselves. In not. Sure, there's an explanation. Mom, shes not here. Maybe she just went to a friends house. No, she calls me, she always calls me. - Maybe her phone died. - No. If her phone was dead, it would have gone to voicemail but it just kept ringing. There has to be a rational explanation. Oh, my God. What if this has to do with the other night? - What do you mean? - The attack. Tar... I... Okay, guys, lets just start with calling her friends, okay? My phone is in the kitchen. That's a good idea. What? No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Hello! Help! Can anybody hear me? No. Can you say something? Can anybody hear me? What do you want? Hello? Please, please. Please! Please, hello. Help! Can anybody hear me? Please! In gonna try Sharon again. Put her on speaker. * one of us one of us * - Jess? - Sharon. Do you know where Tara is? Honey, uh, Tara didn't come home last night. We just want to know where she is. No, no. What do you mean? Isn’t she there? Were supposed to get breakfast. I haven't seen her since last night at the party. Sorry. What party? Oh, oh, wait. I-I mean... Wait a minute, she went to a party? Hold on, Tom. Honey, we just... We need to know where she is. Uh, me, her and Alex went for a couple of hours. But then, she left after she got some text. - From whom? - I don't know. But didn't seem like she wanted me to know. Exactly what time did she leave? Uh, maybe 10:00 around there. We got to go to the police. What do you mean? - Ill drive. - Thank you, Sharon. Please, help. There has to be something here that can help me. These-these are my things. Hello? Hello? Oh, my God. Okay, so when do you notice her gone? This morning. She went out last night and never came home. She went to a party and she didn't tell us about it. And then she was supposed to show up for something this morning and didn't, that is not like her at all. Okay, first things first. Fill this out and file the report. After 36 hours, well put someone on it. 36 hours? Are you kidding me? That's unacceptable, we need to do something right now. Janet, lets just hear what he has to say. In so sorry. This is the way it has to be. I don't make the rules. Okay. What if 36 hours is too late? She was attacked the other night? Remember? I do. Is it possible she ran off with a boyfriend? She doesn't have a boyfriend. I told you that. Look, detective my daughter would never not call me. - You don't know her. - Its true. Do you? What did you just say to me? Janet, he's just trying to do his job. Look, all In saying is, I see this a lot. Parents don't think they're teenagers the type to run off. Shes not that type. I can almost guarantee, shell be back home by tonight. - That's it? - For now. You're a father? What would you do if you were me? Exactly. Thank you, detective. Please! Please. Whoever you are, please just talk to me. I can't believe you're being nice to that detective. And you thanking him. He didn't do anything. Really? That's how you feel? Tom, In so sorry, I... I haven't even taken into consideration what you must be feeling right now. In fine. In good. Hang in there, kiddo. Everything's gonna be okay. - Love you. - Love you, too. - Goodnight, mom. - Goodnight. Thank you so much, Tom. I mean it. I just wish there's more I could do. You're a good man. The girls are so lucky to have you. In too. Thank you. Were gonna find her. We will. I should go. Okay. Tara? Tara? Tara? What are you doing here? No. No! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Honey! Are you okay? He was looking something. Hey! Hey! Hey! What do you want? Is that blood? Oh, my God, honey. Okay, okay. Okay, its okay, its okay. Its okay, its okay. * Walking into... * Okay. It wasn't much to go on, but In going to take this right into forensics. How long is that going to take? Well, they're a little backed up. But In gonna stay on em. You promised me that you're going to find out who this is. In going to do everything I can. What if he comes back? As soon as I leave here, lock the door set the alarm, okay? - Thank you for coming. - You got it. Hang in there, Jess. Were gonna find your sister. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. * anyone there * * forced me to leave... * Its okay. * you'll always be a part of me * She hasn't posted anything on her pixelpost. Which is totally not like her. Nothing. Do you think she was maybe dating someone? Like in secret? What do you mean? I don't know, but when she took off that night I had a feeling that she was hiding something. Maybe like a boyfriend. She-she was always with you. Where would she have met him? Well, actually, the last few months shes been unavailable a lot. Okay, um... And its always been school stuff or college prep. But at the same time, shes been on this new dating app called swipe to date. And more than just a few times, like way more. So you think that she was seeing someone? Uh, we need to log into her swipe to date account. What's her password? You would know better than me. I know exactly what it would be. Maybe try a number. Really? She always thinks no one would ever guess it. Shes probably right. Wait, stop. Hey, looks like she was talking to this guy like like, a lot. Yeah, yeah, it does. Whoa. He's 25! Wait... Oh, my God, he's online right now. Wait, message him. Right away. Her... - No, what-what do I say? - I don't know, um, just... Pretend-pretend to be her! Yeah, yeah, right. Okay. Um... Wait, what happened? Where'd he go? I, I don't, I don't know. His whole profile literally just disappeared! He deleted it because he didn't want anyone to see the messages. Do you know who this guy was? No. Okay, lets check her followers. Okay, In in her followers now. I know all her friends, and there's no one new. You may have never seen him, but someone out there has. Come on. Come on. This is so unbelievable. You are not on your own. Were gonna fix this together. A little support in there would have been nice, Tom. I'm sorry, In just as upset as you are but I just don't believe freaking out is gonna help anything. Freaking out? Wow, you haven't changed at all, Tom. You're exactly the same as when we were married. Always in control. God forgive me that I get upset because my daughter is kidnapped. In not controlling. In paying attention. And In not? Is that what you're saying? No. In not saying that, but In saying rehashing the past is not helpful. Fine. Look, with Mackenzie, I had to really try to get police to do their jobs, and getting mad at them didn't do a thing, so we gotta stay focused on the goal which is to get Tara back. I know that, this is not the same thing as what happened to Mackenzie, she got into an accident. Drunk driving is not an accident. - It never had to happen. - I understand that. And you're right, but it did. And at some point, Tom, you have to accept that. Tara is out there. Shes alone. Shes scared. Shes in trouble, we have to find her and we we will find her. Guys, I have to show you something. Come here. Last night, my sister Tara went missing. Today, we found out this man, he's been texting her. This was a really good idea, Jess. And we really need to contact him to see if he knows anything about my sisters whereabouts. His name is Ryan. He's 25... - Who is that? - I don't know. Shh... we think he surfs. That's it. If anyone knows anything about this man or a way we can contact him, message me. We just want Tara home. Thank you. What was he looking for? What? What is this? Oh, my God. Quiet, quiet... I let go, you won't scream, you promise? Promise? Its you. Wheres my sister? - I don't know. - You're a liar. Where is she? Just listen to me, I saw your flash pic, so here I am. You said your sister disappeared last night, right? Yes, she didn't come home. Now where is she? I don't know. She was on a swipe-to-date app this morning and, yeah, I saw her. Wait, that-that was me. - You? - Yes. How do you think I got your picture? I saw all of your messages. And I got on there before you deleted your profile trying-trying to erase your connection to my sister. - Where is she? - No. She dumped me. And then I see her ten hours later on a dating site. Of course, I deleted it, it broke my heart. You know what? This is a waste of time. No, no, I don't believe a word you say. Where the hell do you think you're going? In leaving, this was a mistake. Do you recognize this? Is this why you came here last night? - Let me see that. - We know you're spying on her. Like a pervert in her bedroom? Jessica! Get away from her! - Move away from the car. - In calling the police. He's been stalking her. He knows where she is, mom. And nobody saw his license plate? No, I didn't see the license plate. But everything happened really fast. And this camera, some sort of nanny cam he just took off with it? Yeah, he grabbed it and ran. He wanted to get rid of the evidence. Its probably destroyed by now. - Can you track it? - The camera feed? - Yeah. - That's a good idea. You can find out where he went. Well, sure, if we had the actual camera. But without it, there's nothing we can do. Of course. We did subpoena the dating apps records but it takes time. He may try to contact you again. If he does, call us right away. - Thanks. - Thank you, detective. Goodnight. Do you want me to stay here tonight? Um... No, that's okay, Tom. Well be fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Well, if you need something, In just a few minutes away. Well talk in the morning. Oh, my God. - Hi, Tom. - Hey, Sharon. I finished all the coffee houses. How's it going? All her friends are posting online. That's awesome. Someone has to know something. - Except for Alex. - What do you mean? I texted him everything, but he still hasn't posted the flyer yet. Did you try calling? Yeah, he's back in Chicago but he said that his roommate broke his phone. So that's why he couldn't call, but he could still make text which is a so weird, but there's still nothing on his socials. Let me try something. Hold on. I-I know its in here somewhere. Found it. This is his roommate, let me try him. Uh, hello? - Hey, is this Damon? - Yeah. - Alexs' roommate, right? - Uh-huh. Who's this? Okay, okay, this Sharon, Alexs' friend from high school. - Is he around by chance? - Hi, Sharon. No, he hasn't gotten here yet. Wait, what do you mean? - Like, ever? - What's going on? We thought he was gonna be here by now but we haven't seen him at all. Should I be worried? Okay, um, can you please please just call me back at this number if you hear from him? - Yeah, of course. - Thanks, Damon. - He's not there. - What do you mean? Like, I mean, he never even showed up. Wait, what? That's not what he said in the text. In gonna call the airlines. We gotta figure out what's going on. Is everything okay? Alex isn't in Chicago. He never was. How is that possible? You talked to him the other day. I texted him. I never heard his voice. We just called Alexs' roommate who said he never arrived. What is going on? Do you think Tara's with Alex somewhere? No, why would she be with Alex? That doesn't make any sense. Detective Roberts says its usually some kind of love thing. They're not in love, its not like that. Do we know that? I mean, come on. Its not as if teenagers don't keep secrets. You guys, he never got on the plane. What? Its been 72 hours since Tara went missing. Uh, a lot of you commented on my last video saying that she hasn't even been gone for that long. But you don't know my sister like I do. She would never just disappear not even for one night and not tell her family. Uh, she, shes my best friend. And I-I know someone out there knows something. This is her friends, Alex. He's also missing now. Uh, so, please, if-if you see either of them. Just message me, dm me. Really, anything helps. We just really need to find them. Uh, thank you so much. We really, we really appreciate all of your help so far. Please, help us find Tara and Alex. Thank you. I already looked through pretty much all of it. Alright, honey, In just hoping we can find some sort of clue. Okay. In gonna go print some more posters. Okay? - Okay. - I love you. I love you, too. In just gonna... I don't know. If it makes you feel better, mom, just keep looking. Secret to life. Why are you bringing this, Tara? Seriously, most useful book you'll ever have. He showed up early again today. I think he knew I was gonna be alone. It feels so creepy, it shouldn't but it does. I wonder if I should talk to someone about it but In leaving so soon, it feels like too much trouble. What? Three days ago. We've covered most of the east side and pretty much all of downtown. Tomorrow, well have people focus on the valley. Yeah. Life was so much easier when you kids were babies and we knew where you were every minute of the day. In telling you, once you learn to walk it becomes way more complicated. We just have to keep doing what were doing. I feel like were so close to finding her. I don't know why, but I do. I found something. What is it? Her diary. Tara kept a diary? Well, she did when she was younger and I thought shed stopped. But then I found this hidden in her old algebra book of all places. What does it say? Um, "I feel like he's spying on me. "I don't know how or why he would be "it just feels like he's always watching me even when he's not here." That's gross. Check this one out. "may 4th, I wish he'd just go back to how he was before. "now every time he's around, I get so tense. Like spiders are crawling on my skin." - Wait, what? - Why didn't she tell me? No-no, when did you say she wrote this? Um, sorry, that was may 4th. - That doesn't make any sense. - Why not? I saw when they started talking. - What do you mean? - On the dating app. Tara and Ryan never meet until June. No, no, no, that's not right cause shes been mentioning him since March. - Then who is he? - It doesn't say. What do you mean it doesn't say? I don't know, she, she just says, "he, him." Only pronouns, there's no mention anywhere in here of Ryan or anybody. - Detective Roberts. - Oh. Hello. What do you know about an Alex Cortez? Why is he asking about Alex? What was that? Sorry, uh, Alex Cortez was a very good friend of Tara's but we think he was lying about something. Lying about what? Well, he said that he left for college but we found out that he never got on the plane. So you don't know where he is? No. Why? I don't wanna frighten you, but the DNA analysis from the blood on the windowsill came back. Alex is the one who broke into Tara's bedroom that night. Oh, my God. We've circulated his photo and put out an APB. Ill call you with any more information. March, Alex would have been back for spring break around then. Well, I never told him about the diary. Okay, In heading in that direction let me take this down to the station, okay? They're gonna wanna see this. The solution to the whole case could rest in these pages. Wait, wait. Hold on a second, Tom. What? I don't think we should trust them with that. No, Janet, we talked about this. Tom, I don't think we should give that to them, okay? - Maybe mom is right. - No, no. This is way more than we can handle on our own, okay? We can post a million flyers, we can send dms we can send emails, but the truth is we need the cops to find Tara, okay? They have resources that we just don't. Who knows what Alex is doing to her right now? - Stop talking about that! - This is exactly my point. Were running out of time. Detective Roberts is our best chance. He's probably our only chance. I need you to trust me. He's right, mom. Janet? Fine. Go. Okay. Ill check on you two later. Lock the doors, lock the windows and turn on the alarm, we don't know what this creep is capable of. Come on. Come on. Connected. Connected. Oh, my gosh. Whoa. What the heck? She says shes gonna pass out flyers to everyone she knows. Uh... Um... uh, come on. Come on! - Its Ryan. - Ryan? What does he want? He says he's got proof that he's innocent. We already know that. - Mom? - Huh? But he thinks he knows where she is. - What? - He dropped a pin to meet him. We need to go now. - Where is he? - Text him again. - Nothing? - No. Alright, lets get out of here. - Are you sure? - Yeah. He's playing with us. I don't think he knows anything. Okay. Mom, he just texted me. He finally replied. - Who? Ryan? - No. Alex. What? "I'm sorry I lied to you, rocky. Tara and I are in Vegas." - Vegas? - Wait. Hold on. "what can I say? Love makes you do crazy things sometimes. "we just needed to drop off the grid for a minute "before resuming the college grind. Well be back in a couple of days." Drop off the grid? Why wouldn't she call me? This doesn't make any sense. I don't know. What should we do? Um, just call him right back. - Straight to voicemail. - Of course it did. He probably just turned the damn thing off. - Detective Roberts? - Yes. Listen, we-we know where Tara is, you were right. Shes with Alex. They're in Vegas. Janet, I have to tell you something. - Oh! What? - We found her car. - What? - We found Tara's abandoned car. - Where? - Carrion national park. Its about three hours outside of town. Carrion park? What? Do you know where that is? - Yes, I do. - Mom, that's hours away. - Its... I know. - How soon can you get here? Um, were, were on our way. Just get here as soon as you can. I want you to stay in the car, okay? No, In coming with you. Sweetheart, I don't know what... In coming with you. Excuse me, ladies, this is a crime scene. This is my daughters car. - This is my daughters car? - Yes. Its okay, Collins, let them through. - Alright. - Thank you. Thanks for coming, ladies. Okay, this is what we know. The car was dumped here intentionally and then camouflaged, most likely to buy the killer some time before it was discovered. - The killer? - Yes, maam. You should probably see this. Okay, honey, I need you to go to the car right now. - No. - Go to the car right now. Actually, In gonna need a statement from both of you. In staying. Oh, my God. Is this the man who attacked you in your home? Yes, I-its Ryan. His names Ryan Cavalleri. That's my daughters... Sweater. I'm sorry, but that has to go to forensics right away. Wheres my daughter? Hopefully, this will bring us closer to figuring that out. But In gonna need you to keep this quiet until we can notify next of kin. Can you do that? Yeah. Hey, can you close that up for me? Mom, Alex couldn't have done that. I don't know. I don't know. Could the man that Tara was talking about in her diary, could that have been Alex? The what? Tara's diary. The one my ex-husband dropped of earlier today. I never got it, but he could have given it to somebody else at the station. You never got it? Ill look into it as soon as I get back. Yeah, let us know when you find it. - Of course. - Thank you. Lets go, baby. Okay. Okay. What is this? What the hell? Hello, Janet, none of this was necessary. You were unwilling or unable to see what was so painfully obvious. Our children need to be protected. If we don't keep them safe, who will? That's our sacred duty as parents. They'll rebel, of course. They'll fight for their independence. Tell you how controlling you are. That they think they know better. You know... My daughter thought she knew better... ...And now shes dead. You know... I actually liked Alex very much. That was tough, but when he tried to become a hero I really had no choice. Hey. Get away from her. What are you doing? Collateral damage, but nevertheless still a tragedy. Which brings us to Ryan. His obsession with Tara was ultimately his downfall. He became a liability. You see, the moment he took a hold of my camera his fate was sealed. Curiosity killed the cat and all that. Mom, you in here? What? Oh, my God. Which brings us to Tara. You were willing to let her fly all the way across the country beyond our purview, where God knows what could happen to her. - No. - Date rape. Do you know how many college kids die from alcohol poisoning? Hazing? Drunk driving? You knew what happened to Mackenzie yet you were unwilling to protect your daughter from having the same exact thing happen to her. What is this? I'm sorry, but In not interested in attending any more funerals. You see, Janet, you and I both want what's best for Tara. What is this doing in your computer, Tom? Wheres Tara? Where is my daughter? Shes fine. Shes in her room, probably just napping. Its Alexs' blood. Tara? In her room? Trust me, shes fine. Help me! No! You'll find out soon enough. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? My mom and sister have been taken. I know where they are, but I need help. Okay, maam, is someone in immediate danger? Yes. They've been kidnapped. That's what In trying to tell you. Maam, In sorry, you're cutting in and out. Can you go to a better location? No, no. In almost there. Please! Please, can you hear me? Can you talk to me? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. No, just... Dammit! Sorry, I still can't hear you. Dammit! It, its 4765 Mentone avenue. I didn't catch that, can you repeat? 4765 Mentone avenue. I'm sorry, you're still cutting out. Just trace the call. - Are you still there? - Yes! Just trace it! Hello! Please. Tara? Tara? I made your favorite. Peanut butter and pickle sandwich. Its all natural, totally organic no preservatives. Janet, that's enough! Is that my mom? - Tom, is that my mom? - It is. I thought that for today you might like to eat lunch with your mom. Just the two of you. What did you do to her? Let me go get her. Tom, no! Tom! Tom! Mom? Mom. Mom... - Shh! Shh! - He has her. He's got Tara. I know. I saw. But we need to get you out of here. Okay? He's coming. He's coming. Put the gag back on. - What? - Put my gag back on. - Do it. - No. Do it, please, and hide. Do it, please. Sorry. You want to see Tara? Yes. Okay. One last time. Lets go. - Come on. - Oh! Mom. - Are you okay? - Are you hurt? Oh, God. Oh, God. Of course, shes fine, that's the whole reason shes here. Shes safe with me now, finally. Now you need to eat and drink eventually. So, please. The other ones for you. Ill leave you two for lunch. Ill be back to check on you later. - Are you okay? - In okay. Is Jessica okay? No, shes fine. Honey, listen to me. In gonna get us out of here. Shh! He's always listening. Sweetheart, look how thirsty you are. Do you need more? Take it. Take mine. - You sure? - Yes. Okay. What are you doing? No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. No! No! No! You couldn't even keep her safe even in here. Tom? Tom! That was meant for you, Janet. Not my precious Mackenzie. - Stop! - Shes dangerous. I have to do this, I do not want anybody... I will not lose you again because of her. Tom, Mackenzie is dead. Okay? Shes dead. Please, just stop. Shes dead. Okay? Okay? - Tom. - Tom! Get off of her! I don't understand. I always have your best interests in mind yet you never listen. Rocky, duck! Oh, God. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Mom, are you okay? Its okay, its okay. Its all gonna be okay. Oh, I don't know if In ready for this. Me neither. Like, they you still got me. I know. Hey, are you really gonna need all of this stuff? Uh, don't worry, I left plenty of stuff here. - This is still my home. - Are you sure? Cause there's barely any room for me to drive in there. - What are you trying to say? - You got too much stuff. I hate this. I miss you already. You'll be okay. You can text, dm, zoom, face me everyday if you feel the need. God, In not totally pathetic. Alright, guys, lets wrap this up. If we don't leave now, then well never make it. We know your mom will be super stoked about that. Maybe just a little. Bye, Jess. - Make it a photo? - Mm-hm. Selfie. Okay, that's everything. One last thing. Look inside. What am I going to do without you guys? Gosh, don't forget about us. Okay. Okay. I gotta go. Or I keep crying. I love you. Call me, okay? - Drive safely. - Well try. Ill call you as soon as I get there. I love you guys. Okay. Bye, guys.
