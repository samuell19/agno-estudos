Anyways I'm late today, Boss will scold me today for sure. Mom! This is my last interview, If I don't get this job, I will start working as bus cleaner with Sivan bro. Then, I can earn at least 500 bucks a day. I won't let you work as bus cleaner. After your dad passed away, I faced all this trouble to send you to college, That's not to work as bus cleaner. I want you to work as an officer in a big office. Why are you troubling yourself at this age? I shall bear any pain till my son gets a good job. A bus cleaner... You're saying all this because of that political party you believe in, First leave that party, Then you will be better. Mom, my dad was a communist, And I'm his son, I will be a communist till my death, So, won't you listen to your mom? Please forgive me, I will listen to anything you say except this one. Come!

It's not time yet. Can you please hold this bag? As I started early, I was a bit late. She's coming, Is the bus coming? Not the bus uncle, my life. Hi dear, Hello, Hello, good morning. What happened? Is Master's bike not working today? No, I have to do an engine work today. Can you do engine work? Of course, If I don't repair at least one engine a day, I can't sleep peacefully. Haven't you seen me doing it? No, I have not. Didn't you? Just keep on watching me. What for? To see me repairing engines. So, your master was just kidding about you. What did he say? He said that you don't even know how to tighten a chain. Shall I tell you one thing, I do all the engine repair work, But I let him take the credit, As he is an elder man, Let him take the credit. That's why there are so many complaints about all the work. These customers are never satisfied whatever we do, They are of a special kind, Your master is coming, Student, come here, What's it, master? What are you doing here? As it's a bus stop, I'm waiting for bus. That I understood, When I went to your house, Your mother told me that you left early to repair an engine. Have you ever touched an engine? As far as I know, I haven't. Good, Then why did you start early? Antony master had told me that he will repair an engine today, He asked me to come early and watch it, And I was telling her about it... Isn't it, Jincy? Get on the bike! It's ok master, I will go by bus. Why do you want to waste money? Come on! I will go by bus. You don't have to pay for the fuel. Whatever it is, I won't come with you today. That's my decision. Sambhu, go with master. Why to pay 10 bucks for bus! No Jincy, my decision is final. Don't force me. Is it so? Ok, next time when you ask for my bike, To go to town, or buy gas cylinder... I will answer you then. - Sambhu, aren't you going with master? - No. As we all are working in the same office, So what? So, I will go with him. Then you come with me Jincy. Come on! Hold tightly, I ride very fast. You stand there like a post, Ok Sambhu, See you in office Shut up! Bus is not coming... Dude, be confident, Best of luck, I don't have any hope. Just to get humiliated once again Manu, don't lose hope, What else can I say? Even now, my mom has to work and earn for us. People have started to laugh at me And Meera, I want to marry her. For that, I need a job. Thinking about all these, I'm getting exhausted. Why are you doing all this? You have influence in the party. If you try that way, You can find a job easily. I don't want to get a job with political influence. I don't want to earn money like that. Why are you thinking like that? That? That's because I'm a communist. Ok Then, I'm leaving. See you. Anil, Where's your boss? Dude, boss is not here, he will be late today. This is some medicine, Keep this in the fridge. Ask your boss to call me. Ok dude. Keep it in the fridge.

Why are you tensed about it? Your sister's wedding will happen tomorrow morning, With more gold than we had promised. Don't be tensed. Will the police catch us? Police? After me? No police will come after me. You be brave. Come. Who's knocking in the morning itself? Hello, - Good morning. - What do you want? I want to meet Jijo. Can you call him? Sir, police is here. Don't tell him. Jijo! Don't be foolish. Stop! Jijo, stop there. Ramu! Leave him. If you hit him like this, He's also a human. Let me ask, Dear, Jijo, in the name of Jesus, Tell us everything. Or all these people will smash you. I don't have the strength to see that. On god's name, I can't stand it. Tell me. I will tell you, sir. I will tell you everything. Tell me dear. May god bless you. Drink it fast. I am feeling tempted. - Do you want one more glass? - No thanks. Bring one more glass. No aunty, it's ok. You want milk? You get inside that cradle first, I will give you milk. I only asked for milk. Don't keep worrying about the things here, I will take care of everything. Ok? The cooks and decorators will come at 10. For dinner, we will serve Chicken biryani. I wish it finishes somehow. Will finish it? O God! May there be sufficient food to feed everyone! Where did you go, mom? I went to the temple to pray. Everything will be fine. You join the work with your father's blessings. - Good things will happen to you, son. - Ok then. Let's go, otherwise it will be late. OK, mom. You need not be tensed about anything, OK. You need not get off. You can't do it. Bro, what about the money? I will not change my word. I will give them this and get the money. Hello, what is it? Hello, Shambu. Where are you? I have been calling you for a long time. Why don't you pick up the call? I am here only. Where is dad? Dad has not come out of his room since he returned. Neighbours and relatives have started coming. I had told you that time itself, that marriage is not needed now. But you had insisted. I am not sure what to do now. If this marriage goes off.... Don't talk non-sense. I have arranged the money and gold. I am on my way. Will be there in half an hour. You console father. - You understand? - Yes. Madam. Hi Manu, please come. You are really a lucky guy. Joining the work today and getting married tomorrow. That too someone you loved. You are very lucky. Thank you, madam. No need for thanks, but I need a treat this evening. Of course, it is all arranged. MD will be here by 12. Have you got all the certificates? Yes, I have got everything. What is this? Since it is the first day, some sweets for everyone. Oh sweets. - Let me have it first. - Oh yes, madam. Manu, just a minute. Hello. Why did it take so long for you to take the call? I was in a meeting. Oh, your meeting. I couldn't sell the property yet. I will settle all the money once it is sold. I am wavering all the interest of the money you are supposed to give me. You can pay the money anytime you wish. But you have to do me a favour. What favour? You can do it. My son John should be posted in the assistant manager vacancy in your office. You have to do it. Oh, but someone has already joined in that post. That's not my problem. First listen to me and then do as you wish. My son has just got a marriage proposal. There is only one thing he lacks, That he doesn't have a good job. That is why I called you. Now you tell me your decision. Tell your son to come to my office with all his certificates. - He has to reach before 11. - OK. You have come to the senses now. Hey, get up. - What is it? - Get up. Madam asked you to leave now and come back later. But Madam asked me to wait here. Won't you leave till you meet her? - No, but she asked me to wait. - Get out. People just come, to trouble others. I just wanted to tell madam. Go, get out. You can tell her later. What are you doing? Tell me what is the issue? Get out. Hey, don't just roam around here. Go home. I came here to join as assistant manager. You have no job here, get out. Hello. Sorry, Manu. I am little busy. - Brother, please let me talk. - Get out. Sorry Manu. This is for your manager. Tell her never to cheat someone like this. God, I wish I get all of them today itself. - How much is it? - 5 Rupees. Didn't you go to office? What happened? Come. Everything is lost. You come here, let me ask. Lakshmi, keep this inside. You come here. We will talk it over there, you come. You don't worry, everything will be alright. You stay here. I will give this and come. Bro, what about the money? You call home and tell them. We will be there with the cash in 10 minutes. `- Hey, John! Let's go. - What happened. Police is coming. They are coming in mufti.
