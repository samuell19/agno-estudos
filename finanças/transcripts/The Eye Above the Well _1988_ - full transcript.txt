One girl with all the boys is impossible. No problem. It's the martial arts that count. The competition won't be fair. Boys will do better, jumping and kicking. Don't see it that way.

It came on the atoll as a thick black thunder cloud rolls over the sky... ...and burst like a storm over Chittu. Working? - Yes, I'm working. How are you? - Could be better. And Valiamma? - Valiamma died. It was hard. Who looks after the house now? -1 do. It is difficult. But there are no debts. Everything has been paid for. Move over.

Adorned with sunbeams and bearing lovely gifts... ...she spreads herself across the globe. They harness the red sun horse. The first morning light shines.
