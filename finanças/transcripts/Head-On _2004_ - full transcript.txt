I walk along the stream, watch the fish in the murky water. But I am sad because of you, my beloved Saniye with the flowing hair. I am sad because your looks do not reciprocate my love. But I am sad because of you, my beloved Saniye with the flowing hair. I am sad because your looks do not reciprocate my love. Cahit, are you alright? Want to drink something, Seref? - Yes, coke. Give me another beer, sweetie. Feeling thirsty today, huh? Yes, buddy. Then drink water. I'm not a beast. How was that concert? Disappear Maren. Asshole! Go fuck yourself! - wanker! Hey you! Hey, you bum, I'm talking to you! Such a salacious woman and you throw her out? Are you gay or something? Apparently you are gay ... Hey, are you stupid or what? Get away, Cahit! Go home! Get lost! Stop the shit! You have to go home! Go home! My old lady brought me here. Says to Schiller: "I'm afraid of my husband!" Well, what am I? "I'm scared of my husband!" Double-dealing cunt, that. But I know people, I'm telling you, I'll finish the tart off ... What kind of people? - People from the security service. I'll finish her off ... Who does she think she is? But Schiller is okay, actually. I already saw him last time ... - You were also in the 13th ... Mr. Cahit Tomruk, please. There are a thousand other ways to take your own life. Why did you drive against a wall? Who tells you that I wanted to kill myself? There were no skid marks ... You are not allowed to smoke here, Mr Tomruk. Where does the name Tomruk come from? - From Turkey. I mean, what does it mean? No idea... The names all have such beautiful meanings. Is that so? Much more than ours. At least I know that about the first names ... Finish your life, if you want! But you do not have to die for that! End your life here and go away! Do something meaningful. Do SOMETHING. Go to Africa. Help people. Do you know the band "The The"? Der Der, Die Die, Das Das. Excuse me? There is a song: "If you can not change the world, change your world". Should I bring you the record? - I've already got it. May I tell you something, Doctor? You're out of your mind, right? Are you Turkish? Would you marry me? What? - Would you marry me? Fuck off! Nice to meet you, Cahit Tomruk. Cahit Tomruk ... Sibel Tomruk ... Excuse me, are you looking for something? A cold one, please. Unfortunately we do not have cold ones, but you can have a coffee! The shame you have brought on us is unforgivable. The greatest gift to man is life. There is no greater gift than life. What do you think you are, to just throw away this gift? You can be glad that you are still alive. Do you have the keys, Yilmaz? See you later... Tell me, do not you realize what you are doing to the old man? He's dying! Look at me! Look at me! If anything happens to the old man, I will wipe you away! Give me one too. What good is it it for you to kill yourself? The only thing you can do is make us and you unhappy: Do not forget that. I thought they would leave me alone. Leave you alone? I haven't managed to teach you anything! Do not say that, mother. Oh, Sibel ... How long will you stay here? - No idea. Wouldn't want you to go crazy among all the crazies here! Well, Cahit. That's not how you kill yourself. - How does one not kill oneself? Perpendicular. - What "perpendicular"? You have to cut perpendicularly, not across ... Across is shit. - Oh. Do you have a beer, Fatty? - If you marry me. I only fuck men. - Really? You know what? I'll get you a beer. Tonight at 12 in front of the clinic, okay? Where is my beer? - Come along. Where are you from Turkey? - From Mersin. Mersin is said to be beautiful. - Yes I know. I was born there. We are from Zonguldak. Do you know Zonguldak? Why do you want to die? I asked you something! Do you find my nose pretty? Touch it. My brother broke it because he caught me holding hands. And now grab my tits. Have you ever seen such sexy tits? I want to live, Cahit. I want to live, I want to dance, I want to fuck! And not just ONE guy. Do you understand me!? I'm not deaf! You understand shit! Will you marry me now, Cahit? - Forget it. No! No. Leave me alone! Marry? Say girl, are you crazy or what? That's not child's play! - We're just pretending, you understand? No, I do not understand. It's just an alibi for my parents, so I do not have to live at home. We live together, but I promise you, I'm a good roommate. I go shopping, I cook, I clean up, I clean the toilet ... We have separate rooms, we do not fuck, We're not actually a couple. - And your parents? Your in-laws. You don't have much to do with them! Yes, what do I have to do with them? From time to time they come to ours, or we visit them. And then we act as if we are man and woman, or what? Or how did you envisage that? Girl, are you crazy? Why me? I'm a bum! Because my parents can accept you. You are a Turk, man! What's going on here? Get out! What's this? I said, get off! Why? Because on my bus there is no room for such godless dogs as you! Get out, you too! Fatty, what's up? - How, what's going on? It's not your bus. It belongs to the city! Fuck off! Hey, wait a sec! What's your name? Her window faces the street. Her admirers throw gravel at heir window. My lover is the one with the most beautiful eyebrows. Seek your beloved also and count your dowry. Say, are you completely stupid? Are you an actor or something? Do you want the Oscar? You do not understand that: she's in trouble. Mind your own business? What do I know? Otherwise she wants to kill herself. She will do no such crap! As if that was that easy. That's women for you! To rope one in they make up stories. Do you know what marriage means? - No, I do not know. Problems! Look at me. Did I get married? No. I owe nothing to anyone and have my peace. You lie. You married! That is something different. That was to stay here. That's basically the same thing. Then marry, damn shit! God bless you! I'll come to the wedding and dance with you. There's still a small matter ... - What? Birsen? - What? Do you know this guy? - No, but our daughter knows him. So she knows him. How can you give our girl to a stranger? She has made many mistakes so far. Maybe it will get better now. She's flawed because you spoilt her. Since childhood! When are they coming? - Tomorrow, whether you want it or not. Tomorrow already? Let them, damn it! You're getting us both into deep shit! Which city are we from? From Mersin. Not Malatya? - No, man. It was Mersin. Fuck your Mersin. Friends, what's wrong with you? None of your fucking business! Do you have to yell at each other? - Hurry up, I'm still waiting on my turn. I'll finish you off. - How dare you talk to me like that? That's not what I meant. That's alright, then. There's no alcohol in the pralines, right? No. - You sure? Are you kidding me? For real? - Fuck it, there's no alcohol in them! Fuck your alcohol! Ones with alcohol are too expensive anyway. Don't blow your gasket! it was just a question! You ask the same shit a 100 times! What house number? - 8. What's with your hair? - That's fashionable now. This is a marriage proposal and you look like a fagot! Like that they won't give you their daughter! What was the name again? - Guner. So you are the uncle of Cahit? Yes ... That means I am his youngest uncle. How many siblings are you? Uh ... second ... we are so many ... Seven. - Yes, seven. Not bad! Your nephew looks similar to you. Yes, possibly. Where do your parents live? My parents ... died. My condolences. Thanks. You don't have siblings? Yes, I have a sister in Frankfurt. Don't you ever see each other? Occasionally. Your Turkish is pretty crap. How did you manage that? I tossed it out. That was a joke! There's no alcohol in the chocolates, right? No no! Of course not. Where are you from? From Malatya. From Mersin. That is, part of the family comes from Mersin, a part from Malatya. They moved from Mersin to Malatya ... A widely scattered family! - Yes exactly! Thank you very much. - I hope it tasted good. Where did you meet my sister? Well, I work in the hospital. Cahit visits me from time to time ... two or three times a week ... And one day, when visiting, he saw Sibel. Well, and then we decided to buy chocolates. And you are the manager in a factory? - Yes. Well, no, I am the manager of "the factory". This is a cultural and events center in Altona. I'm the boss. - I'll come visit you. - Yes gladly. Isn't he a little too old for you? I like him. Couldn't you find a better guy? We dined and drank. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Let's get down to business We've come to ask, with God's permission, on behalf of my nephew Cahit for the hand of your daughter Sibel in wedlock. Sibel! Yes, father ... Have you made your decision? Yes, father. What is one to do? When two young people agree and enjoy each other, what is left for us to say? God bless you. - Thanks. Cahit, kiss your father's hand. Thanks. Yes, I'm coming! Are you dumb or something? - Hi, Cahit! Do you have coffee here? The coffee machine is in fucked. Say, such a Turkish wedding, it's really expensive. Who pays for that? - I got the dough. Where from? - I always thought that I's run away from home. So I saved. - Damn, why didn't you do it? Because of my mother. - Oh yes? Is your sister coming, too? - No. Why not? - None of your fucking business! Say, who is your best man? Your brother? My cousin Selma from Istanbul. She's cool. - I do not give a damn. She'll bring along a whole suitcase full of Turks or something. She's coming alone. She is divorced. We can do that, too, then you're rid of me. - Good idea. Here! - What's that shit? I guessed. I don't know if it fits you. Well guessed. I missed you! -How was your flight? They frisked me again. Where is my brother-in-law? - He's busy ... Let me take a look. Your butt has filled out nicely. How did you meet? That is a long story. - Do tell ... Where should I start? - At the beginning. Selma. - Cahit. Take care of her. Thanks. - What should I do now? Kiss you or what? - Later. What? - Later. Sibel Güner, born on 16.6.1983 in Hamburg, Marital status, single, nationality, German. Is that correct? - Yes. Cahit Tomruk, born on 25.8.1960 in Mersin, Turkey, Marital status, widower, also German citizen. Is that correct? Yes that's right. - Then you can go to the wedding ceremony now. How did your wife die? Cahit! - Shut up, OK?! What's going on there? - I did not understand. Don't you speak German? - Of course I do. I want five kufte. Ladies and gentlemen! We are gathered here to celebrate the wedding of Sibel and Cahit. Welcome! Let's ask the bridal couple to the dance floor with your applause! Cahit, we have to dance now! - I do not dance. We have to! - That's just not happening! Please, Cahit. I implore you. Cahit, people are watching! You double-dealing cunt! - Yes I am... What's that? - This is your room. This is the dining area. - All right. I'll pick you up in half an hour. -All right brother. Do you want something too? - Yes. Don't you want to carry me over the threshold? Oops! That's for later. Can I ask you something? - Yes, sure. What was your wife's name? What's that about? Get out! Fuck you, shit! Catherine. Will you give me one more? - I actually wanted to knock off. Already? At some point it's over, right? Do you know where I can crash today? - At your groom's? He kicked me out. - Well great, that's a good start. Well if you want you can crash at my place. Only if you want to. Do you realize that you are stealing a bride? You did not have to marry, there were so many alternatives. Give me one. You could have studied. In another city. As if I had a high school diploma ... - You could have married someone else. Not such a bum! I am too young to marry seriously and become a housewife! Come to my place. To Istanbul. Wow, bimbo red alert happening here, That's incredible! I'll stab you in your cock! What did that shit cost now? - So much that I'm broke now. And who pays the rent now? - I do not know. I'm not paying your share, just to be clear. Can you shut up already? Leave it now! Do you want to turn a farmer into a model? So. Done. Go take a shower. Should I help you or what? Are you in a good or a bad mood? Meh. Thanks. - You're welcome. Who cut those? My roommate. Since when do you have a roommate? Since Ochsenzoll. Do you fuck? - No. No. Is she nice? She needs a job. Hi, I'm Sibel. You are Cahit's roommate? - Yes. You are looking for a job? - I can cut hair very well. Well then... Hi. I have an appointment for eleven. - Yes, take a seat. Do you want to? - Yes. Is that okay with you if she does it? - Of course, no problem. Thanks. How would you like it? Just the tips, please. - You got it. Should I wash them? - I just did, they're still a bit wet. That looks cool! - Yeah, Fatty, yeah. Next, I'll do a tattoo! A real phat one. - Yes! Maren is one tasty chick! - Yes! Hot ass that, right? - Yes, I think so too. She really has a great ass! Does my piercing suit me? - Yes! That's cool, that's really cool. I want people to see that. Are you going dancing with me? - No, not interested. Oh please! Let's do it. I want to show you off. - Okay! If I clean up shop. OK! Punk is not dead! Cahit, I'm going to fuck now! Did you see the guy? How many heads did you have to wash to pay for that thing? Yilmaz gets it cheaper through the workshop, you know? Say, do I really have to come? Crap. We've been married for almost half a year and have never been there. I don't want to go cotton picking! - Oh, please Cahit! Fuck your "Oh, please!". Your Turkish is really improving. Whose turn is it? Brother, play it! Either pull here or take that, Fatty! Just how could you give your girl to that guy? Do not interfere in our family affairs! I was at the Pasha last week. New chicks at the start. Everything there, Scandinavian, African ... Turkish? - I've got the basement full of that, Fatty. Play, it's your turn! Brother in law! You have to come with me! Where to? - The whorehouse. What am I supposed to do in the whorehouse? What a question! Do you know Michael Jackson's brother? Siki Ceksin (you will fuck) That's a good one. Why don't you fuck your own wives? What did you say? Why don't you fuck your own wives. It's your turn. Never use the word "Fuck" again in connection with our wives! Do you understand me? - What? Did you understand me? - Calm down. Galatasaray will be champion. They'll be eliminated, dude. What was that? I'll smash your mug! I'll bash your mug! And, what's your husband like? Very sweet. And in bed? OK. Does he lick? Like a cat. You've got it good! Mine licks like an ox and sometimes he moohs while at it. Wait a second. I was at "the factory" last week. You are not the CEO. You're just clearing the jugs & glasses. Why did you lie to us? Imagine that you were in my place. You're a fucking cleaner ... Would you have given me your sister otherwise? You love her? Yes. I love her. Thank you very much. I just look at him. Another beer please! Make that two! I ask him, "What's wrong with you?" He had completely burnt eyebrows, everything is scarred. "Fatty, what's the matter with you?" He says, "I'm lovesick." - "But that does not explain that matter ..." Do you want something else? - No, I still got some. I can give you a few things to listen to ... Yes? - Yes. - I would be glad. I have a few demos at home ... So ... - Do you live near here? - Yes, around the corner. Hi? That can't be true, one double after the other ... - You're doing great, eh? What makes you think that? You fuck better. Wasn't a bad idea to marry you. I learned from my mother. Speaking of mother ... My mother asked me about children today. Let us make some! I think if it gets too wild, I tell her you're impotent. It's a good reason for divorce. Do we want to go to the Taksim tonight? Hi. Will you make me a spritzer? What the .... ? Thanks. Did you see her? - Whom? My wife. The little girl is your wife? - So what? What are you looking like that for? - I thought you don't fuck. We do not fuck Why not if you are husband and wife? Hi, where are you going? - I want to get in there. I'm sorry, not without a woman. You'll laugh, but my wife is in there. I'm not interested! - Oh, so. - Exactly. Fuck you! - Chillax, man. - What? Wait a moment! This is my husband! Okay, that's your husband. But calm down! Calm down! Very easy, okay? Don't cause any trouble in there, okay? - Yes. Alright, alright, boys. Peace! Sibel! I'm sorry that I ran away earlier. Forgive me! It's okay. I'm totally nuts, you know? Everyone is. Hey sweetie, everything OK? - What do you want from me? You! Don't you see? - Fuck off. Stay cool. This is my wife. - What? Cahit! - What Cahit, what's going on? Your face didn't get it too badly. I'm just trying to look good. Shit Kanaks. What? You are one yourself. I know so little about you. Then get to know me. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I cannot do it. I cannot do it. If we do, then I am your wife and you are my husband. Do you understand? I'm in love! In love! She bewitched me. Stop it, lad! Stop it, I say! Fuck your love. Look at yourself! Do you even know what love is? Love is a carousel! You put money in and it goes around! But always in circles, and your horse is only made of wood! You don't understand me! You don't understand anything! Her name was Katharina. She was a totally happy person. Like a kid, really funny. Liked to laugh. Everyone liked her. I really liked her. What did she do? - Painted. Did Cahit love her? Yes, very much What kind of weird relationship do you have? He is my husband and I am his wife. Do you love each other? You wouldn't understand ... Yes, I'm probably too stupid for that. I do not understand it myself. Cahit and me, we fuck sometimes. Crap! Yah? - What do you want here? I wanted to see you. - How so? Niko listen: I wanted to know what you're like in bed. Now I know it. Let's just avoid each other, okay? Leave me alone! I am a married Turkish woman, if you get too close, will my husband kill you, get it? Who is she married to? What kind of a shitty husband are you anyway? The little one is the town bike and you don't give a shit ... Do you actually fuck her? Oh, you are her pimp, right? Fuck you! - Niko, you talk too much. Does her cunt fetch enough money? Tell me... How much does it cost if I want to fuck her in the ass? Are 50 Euros enough? In the whorehouse that's called "Greek"! I want to fuck your Turkish girl Greek! Niko! Niko! Call a doctor! Listen, you can't stay here. You have to get out tomorrow morning without anyone seeing you. Otherwise they'll wear my guts for garters! Do you understand me? Yes. Don't you have anyone else to go to? Answer me! No. Great God in heavens! And what are you going to do now? They'll kill me. Who? - My family. Your family! What did you expect? You constantly fuck up and then: "My family ...! Don't you have anyone in Turkey? But ... - Then go there. And Cahit? What is your concern with Cahit? Do not you see what you did to him? You ruined his life! "And Cahit?"! Now listen, Do you really love Cahit? Yes. Then do him a favor: Go! Why are you crying, my black-haired beauty? Everything that comes into existence also passes. Do not Cry. Even if your cries rise to the sky. Everything that comes into existence also passes. Do not Cry. Whatever happens, every winter is followed by a spring. Everything that comes into existence also passes. Do not Cry. Hand over nothing, take nothing, no access to documents, and there will be no talk about the current action. Please pull the door closed behind you. I will wait for you. Put on the seatbelt, Sibel. Your hair looks good! Are you hungry? No. And what are you going to do now? Will you get me a job? At a barber? Doesn't matter. We will see... Laugh for a change! How's it going? Well. Sibel, do not worry. It's only for a short time. I'm waiting for a response from the barber Ahmet. As soon as position becomes vacant, he'll hire you. Take care! I'll be right there! Do you like the hotel? Shall I tell you something? For all this I will be responsible some day. I will manage the hotel in a few years ... Then you could work wherever you want! How do you like that? You can only rely on yourself Can I get a raki? Are you missing Cahit? Come on, Sibel! STAFF ENTRANCE So I go to this date and get in the elevator. It is an old building with elevators from the 80s. You get to the top and the doors won't open. There is a wall ... You are not from here, are you? How can you tell? I just can. Listen... Where can I get drugs here? Are you nuts? Where have you been? On road. - Where? None of your business. - Sibel! My darling, it's been a few weeks since I got here. Istanbul is a colorful city, full of life. The only not alive here is me. All I do is to survive. How I would like to discover all this with you. But God puts us to a test. God? I don't know how to believe in him, after all that has happened. You drew the shortest straw, but prison is the only thing that comes to my mind when I think of my life here. I am now working as a chambermaid. Selma got me the job. Selma, whom I admired so much. Today I only have contempt for her. I hope you are well. Kisses from me. Sibel. Are you looking for someone? I'm looking for a fix. What kind of fix? Doesn't matter. What's this? - Opium. Do you want to try? Give it to me. Inhale ... You can work with me ... You can also live with me, if you want ... Where? - I'm moving. Where are you going? - I met some people. What kind of people? Just people ... - Sibel. Do not go. To become like you? Work, sleep, work. That's why your husband divorced you! Sibel! Yes... Go! Hey sweety! What are you doing on the street this late? Are you lost? Do you need a man? Wait a moment! Why don't you go home and fuck your mothers? Stop laughing! Damn hooker! That's enough! That's enough! You sons of bitches! Is that all you got? Girl, fuck off! I'll fuck her now! Who do you want to fuck? Is it enough now? Have you had enough now? Fuck yourselves and your families! What are you blabbing about? You fags! Sons of bitches! Come here! Holy shit! I think we killed the little chick! Shit, damn it! Is that what you wanted? Is that it? Run, brother! Fuck off! Fuck off! Is it good? It's good. Very good! - Isn't it? They got nice skewers here. That's why I always come here. Cheers! Cheers, Seref! And what are you going to do now? I'm going to Istanbul. To Sibel? Yes. Didn't you learn anything? Didn't she hurt you enough already? Without her, I wouldn't have made it. Wouldn't have made what? To stay alive! Well. Take that! What's this? - Take it! I saved it for you! Take it and fly to Turkey! I can't do that! - Take it! No. I cannot do that, I'm sorry. - Stop that crap! After all, I am your uncle. Or have you already forgotten that? Come on, take it and fly to Turkey. Thanks! Brother in law? Where is your sister? I do not have a sister anymore. You have the same mother. How is your mother coping with this? We had to save our honor, do you understand that? And? Did you save it, your honor? Where do we want to go? I do not know. If you do not know, how should I know? - Go straight! OK. Where do you come from? Hamburg? Are you from Hamburg? Hey, I'm from Munich! - A Bavarian or something? In my previous life I was a Bavarian, now I am here. Have deported me. Pigs. Kicked out. You know? All the money out the window. Why? - drugs. Ah yes... In a moment there's no straight ahead. Left or right? Say something. Take me to a cheap hotel, OK? There's ... There's ... I know something! That's just right for you, the "Grand Hotel London." - That's cute. Just between us. The house is haunted. That is good use of the logo. They placed it big at the top, but in this design it is still too small. I want to have it big. I do not like the font. We have to choose one of these. Do you have any other samples? There's someone who wants to talk to you. - Who? Can we continue later? - Naturally. Hello Selma. Welcome. Thanks. Take a seat. Gladly. I hope you have survived it well! - Thanks. How are you? I'm well. And you? You see for yourself ... I am still single ... Can I have a glass of water please? - Sure. For the gentleman a glass of water and for me a red wine, please. This is for you. That was not necessary. - Don't mention it. Thanks. Where do you live? In the "Grand Hotel London". A nice hotel. - Not bad. Thanks. Where is Sibel? She is here. In Istanbul. Take me to her. Please. That's not possible. - Why? She has a new life. She is happy. She has a boyfriend, she has a daughter. She does not need you. How do you know that? When I first met Sibel, I was dead. I had died a long time ago. I lost myself a long time ago. Then she came along and entered my life. She gave me love. And she gave me strength. Do you understand? Do you understand that? How strong are you, Selma? Are you strong enough to stand between me and her? Are you strong enough to destroy her life? No. I'm not. Cahit? Sibel? Cahit, I cannot talk right now. How long will you be in town for? Until I've seen you. Hi? There's a call for you. Cem is in Zonguldak for two days. I'm not coming home tonight. Can you take care of Pamuk? Sweetie, will you stay with me tonight? Maybe I won't come tomorrow either. But at some point you will come back, right? I hope you know what you are doing. No, I don't. I wish you the best. What are you up to? Do you want to stay in Istanbul? - Me, stay in Istanbul? Definitely not. I'm going to Mersin, where I was born. I am not worried. That's nice. Don't you want to come along? With me? Let's go back inside. It's me. Well. What is Pamuk doing? Give her to me please. How can we go about it? We meet tomorrow at the bus station and from there we drive to Mersin. your daughter and me. What time tomorrow? - At twelve o'clock. There is a beacon burning over there on the mountain. Falcons soar above its shimmering light. Are all those who love and miss their beloved, out of their senses like me? I am so overwhelmingly sad. May my enemies go blind. I lost my mind. May the mountains be happy instead of me.
