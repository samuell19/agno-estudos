Mr. Fargus, what have you been saying? Just like the woman. Never any time to read your husband's leading article. Bye, my dear. Good-bye. Mark! Hello. I've got it. I've been up with it ever since you left last night. But I've done it. I'll come down. Right. Come on. I've done it. You think so? Mm-hmm. Now, get out of that, my boy. Now where's your queen? Poor old Victoria. Mark, do come to breakfast, dear. Oh, hello, Mr. Fargus. I didn't know it was you. I'm sorry, Mrs. Sabre, butting in like this. But you see, I had a problem. Well, I have a problem, too. I've just got a couple of new maids to break in. You know how it is. No. I can only remember how it was. Good-bye, Mark. Good-bye, old boy. Wonderful manager, your wife. Yes, but she means well. Mark, do hurry up. I want to get breakfast over before Natalie Bagshaw comes. Good idea. Before the milk turns. Now, you must admit she's amusing. She can still be amusing and say something decent about people occasionally. She'll be furious when she sees our new maids. You know, we've been awfully lucky. They've been with the boltons for years, have characters that long. Think they'll let me stay? Don't be ridiculous. And when you meet them, do let them understand from the beginning that you're the master of the house. Sarah, will you put the tea over here? This is where I always sit. Yes'm. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Rebecca. This is Mr. Sabre. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir, I'm sure. Good morning. They're sisters, you know. Their name is jinks. Splendid. High jinks and low jinks, what? Sarah, you do warm the teapot, don't you, before you make the tea? Well, never mind now. And, Rebecca, in future, we like to use the China cruets for breakfast. You'll soon drop into our ways, I'm sure. Yes'm. Thank you, ma'am. How do you expect me to run a house properly when you say things like that? Like what? High jinks and low jinks. Well, it's funny. Is it? Why? Because, don't you see? Well, it is. Not to me. There's Natalie. Give me a piece of toast, will you, please? Thank you. Anyway, they'll always be high jinks and low jinks to me. I do wish you'd grow up. Hello, children. Good morning, Natalie. Good morning. Morning, Natalie. Would you like some breakfast, dear? Oh, no, thank you. I've had mine. Just couldn't eat a thing. But I'll cadge a cup of tea. Of course. How are you, Mark? Uh, marmalade, please. Enjoying life? Naturally. He's got me. You mean you've got him. The poor man's so married he can scarcely move. He doesn't want to move. Do you, darling? Another cup for Mrs. Bagshaw, Sarah. Yes'm. Humph! How long have you had her? Since yesterday. When's she leaving? Well, not just yet, I hope. Oh, well, there's nothing like optimism. Although I must say she's a great improvement on that doddering old Selena of yours. Selena was a dear. I've been angling and scheming for weeks to get us maids that we wouldn't be ashamed of, and you start sentimentalizing over Selena. She was a jolly good cook in her time. Really? Of course, I'm not old enough to know. Thank you, Sarah. Say, where'd you get that marmalade? I made it. Do you like it? It's scrumptious. Oh, perfect picture of domestic bliss. Positively nauseating. If you'll excuse me, I've had enough. By the way, have you seen the tybars? Are they back? Of course. The fair Nona has returned in triumph with 10 trunks and Tony on a platinum chain. Don't pretend you didn't know. Why should he? Was it on the 8:00 news? Oh, come now. A rejected suitor always knows when his former ladylove swims back into his Ken. Vibrations set up. Or have I been misled? Completely. that was all over a long time ago. Mark's taste has improved since then. He knows when he's well off. Don't you, dear? Homemade orange marmalade. The secret of a happy marriage. Good-bye, Natalie. Mark. I'm sure it was an orange in the garden of Eden. Uh, possibly. Anyway, it was a serpent that came to breakfast. Good-bye, Natalie. Poor old Mark. I don't think he liked what I said about Selena. No, there's one thing about Mark. He's terribly faithful. Let's hope you'll always find him so. Meaning Nona Tybar? Not especially. But I must say that he sprang to attention when he heard they were back. I'll attend to that, darling. At any rate, Nona's not going to stray far from all that money. I wouldn't gamble too much on that. They tell me that Tony's racing losses are colossal. So is his bank account. Don't be too comforted, old girl. If you want the truth, I'm not comforted at all. I'm worried. You can tell me anything, darling. I know Mark married me on the rebound. Who doesn't? I mean, who doesn't take advantage? Oh, you know what I mean. But my conscience is clear. Of course. All's fair, you know. I've given Mark the kind of background a man of his position must have, and I think he's beginning to like it. I'll fight to hold Mark against anyone. Hmm. I'm going to be smart, though. I've got to be smart. You know how to stop little boys from stealing jam? Lock the cupboard door. No, unlock it. Leave the... leave the lid off the jam if necessary. Wonderful! Give me a little more marmalade. Morning, Sabre. Morning, Twyning. Looks well, don't you think? Yes, but, uh... means a partnership, old man. As of the 15th inst. I didn't tell you before. I wanted it to come as a pleasant surprise. Did you? Yeah. Well, it's a surprise, all right. Good morning, Mr. Sabre. Morning, Bright. May I speak to you a moment? Of course, Sabre. We're all one big, happy family here. Well, I'm not happy. Look here, sir, you promised me a partnership. All in good time, my dear fellow. Your books are selling very well. They've earned you a good share of the holdings in the company. And haven't they earned me a right to a voice in the direction of the firm's affairs, just as much as Twyning? Twyning's been with us longer. He's a very valuable member of the firm. Uh, Twyning. Come in, will you? Now, my dear Sabre, as I said, all in good time. All in good time. Not in my good time, I'm afraid. Trouble with Sabre, sir? Yes. About him being made a partner? Yes, but confidentially, he'll never be a partner. I don't like the Wilder liberal elements in his textbooks, nor do I like Sabre. I should prefer him out of the firm rather than in. Is there anything we can do about it? Unfortunately, no. Yes? It's all right. Hello, Marko. Nona. Oh... wait. There. I had to come. Pleased? How do I look? Pleased. Almost as pleased as I am to be here. Oh... it's nice. I always thought it was the nicest place in the world. Now then, tell me about the new ones. Uh... There they are. They speak for themselves. They whisper, but they speak. "Adventures in geology... Picnics with the poets"? They don't sound like school books, Marko. I hope they don't read like them, either. I've think I've hit on a new idea, Nona, something to make knowledge go down a little easier. Tell me about it. But you haven't told me what you've been doing. Oh, that. Oh, I've been around the world. It's a big place, a lot of people live on it. I met quite a few of 'em, liked some, didn't like others. This one... what's this one about? That's our own history. Do you realize that we know less about it as a people than we do about anything? "This england is yours. "It has been kept for you, "not by kings or statesmen alone, "but by the english people, people like you. It is your england, yours." Sound stuffy? Sounds wonderful. You're great for the morale, Nona. You're the only one who gets just what I'm driving at. Am I... Still? It, uh... Hasn't been so long since you went away. Hasn't it? I can't quite make out the postmark, if it's monte Carlo, August 3, '36... That's 3 years ago, isn't it? "Marko, dear, "I am marrying Tony Tybar. "Forgive me. Nona." I know it by heart. "I am marrying Tony Tybar. Forgive me." Well, have you? Forgiven me, I mean? Of course you have. You're Marko... But I've never forgiven myself. This letter didn't seem so cruel 3 years ago. I wonder why I didn't say more. I suppose I... Couldn't. You found t that Tybar was thn u want to mry, th all. Hellth did he t 21r= Tony, up! Ll wthe dead! Apprs rehave. Did! Where I belonged. Now that I am here, I do feel... Home. Or thereabouts. I've been thinkin', sir. In all our contracts, there's a whopping long paragraph that says the whole thing's null and void if we get up to any skylarking. Ah, yes. The clause covering immorality. What's on your mind? Sabre. Well, we can hardly hope to catch Sabre on that. Chap's a bit of a stick in the mud. Rbrb21 I'm you ow what I mean? No, Twyning. I'm ID I do not. Hurr l. Ng htory. Rbdo you s that spot? Now, wst put peth to Mark the world's nonstop bicle rerd, made by m. Sre, June 16, 1939. All th fr the f tree thtop of fd'hill tht tohing a p. Well, never did, s.

That' oh, uh, Nona Tybar her tho was in to see me le b, n'&q this afternoon. She was saying... that was nice of her. How did she look? What sort of a hat did she have on? I didn't notice. That was very tactful of you, darling. Does she still call you "Marko"? Yes. Why shouldn't she? No reason at all. Mark, I want you to do something for me. Uh-huh? See a lot of Nona. Why? I want to prove something. Oh, don't think I'm being silly. I want you to look at her, then look back at me... For good. See? Yes, I... I think you're over her, but I'm not sure that you know it, and I want you to. I'm an extraordinary woman... Aren't I? That's why you appreciate me. Bad luck, old man. Mr. Sabre, whatever happened? Oh, uh, Effie, that's a long story. Well, it didn't look very long. Now, look here, Bright... Sabre! Ha ha... steady, my girl. What's all this? She's mocking my gray hairs. Hmm. They're like that nowadays. I thought you were helping with the tea. That's right, father. Come along, Mr. Sabre. All right. Harold, help yourself to one of them cream buns and get one for me, will you? Right-o, dad. Oh, I'm sorry. Pardon. You're the young Mr. Twyning, aren't you? Yes, and aren't you Mr. Bright's daughter... All grown up? Yes, that's me... Effie Bright. All in the family, so to speak. Yes. Well, it's a small world, as they say. Harold. Coming, dad. Oh... sorry. Pardon. Ha ha ha! Has everybody got everything they want? Plenty. Thank you, sir. Hello. Hello. Better luck in the next innings, Marko. I'll need it. End of the tea interval, Sabre. Better get your men back on the field. Well, here goes. Good luck. Good luck. Quite like old times. We've missed this annual cricket match in long Meadow. So have Tony and I. It's good for everybody in pennygreen to get together for these traditional gatherings. Of course it is. Convention, institutions... They're important. They're the foundation of our security, our peace of mind. I've never underrated their value, particularly in a community like pennygreen. Security... Peace of mind... You know, those are the very things that brought me back home, and they're going to keep me here forever... I hope. Will there be anything else, madam? No, thanks. Mr. Sabre will be over to collect this parcel. Very good, sir. That will be ?3,17 and 8 pence, madam. Um... This. How much is this a yard? Good afternoon, Mr. Sabre. Do you have a parcel here for Mrs. Perch? Yes. Just one moment, sir. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Shopping? How did you guess? Elementary, my dear Watson. I'm picking up a parcel for old Mrs. Perch. I promised to drop it by on the way home. Your parcel, sir. Oh, thank you. Look, why don't you let me drop it for you? Would you? Mm-hmm. Oh, that would be wonderful. I know she'd love to see you. I'd love to see her. Garnet, put this in the car, will you, and strap Mr. Sabre's bicycle to the carrier. You see, life's quite simple. Very, if you happen to have a retinue of retainers. Thank you for a lovely tea. It was wonderful, Mrs. Perch. I can't think what's happened to Freddie. He said he'd get back from the flower show in time for tea. Well, I'll probably see him tonight at the blue boar. There he is now. First prize. Best sweetpeas in the show. "Frederick Perch, esquire." Freddie, that's marvelous. How are you, Mrs. Tybar? How are you, sir? Congratulations, Freddie. And the ?10 prize for the best exhibit. Oh, Freddie, what's this? Oh! Oh, it's lovely! Oh, you shouldn't, Freddie. You shouldn't. Well, how else should I spend my filthy lucre? You could have put it towards the first payment for that motorcycle you want. Oh, I can always do that. You must take it back, Freddie. They'll give you the money! I don't want it. You're a very naughty boy. Now, popsy, how can I take you out dancing without a new dress? I'll do no such thing. Bless you, darling, but I insist. Bless you, darling, but I refuse. Aren't they wonderful? I told you not to send the car home, it was going to rain. Prophet! Don't. Don't do that. Oh, Marko! You came to my office the other day to tell me something. What was it? You gave me your hand and said, "there." Why did you say that? Because I had to touch your hand to live in your world for a little while. My world? Where do you live? Oh, I don't live. I drift. Drift? The dictionary says of flotsam... "goods shipwrecked and found floating on the sea." When I read that, I crossed out "flotsam" and wrote "Nona." And don't dare say I'm feeling sorry for myself, because I am. But at least I know it. I should never have married Tony. Is that what you came to tell me? Mm-hmm. And Tony... he's still in love with you? More than ever. Oh, it's not his fault. It's just that I'm so wrong for him. I thought I wanted the things he wants. I thought I wanted him... But I don't. I never did. I realize that now. All the time, itas you. All the time it's been you. Only you. Good evening, low. Good evening, sir. Good evening, high. Good evening, sir. What happened? Oh, that's the worst I've ever done. Never mind, sir. That's a sort of a record, too, in a manner of speaking. What about a peg for the best worst? Well, that's an idea. Huh? Hello! I thought it would show up better, sir, with a drop of whitewash. Oh, and it does, too. Thanks very much, low, that's jolly nice of you. Shall I do the other, sir? Would you? Yes, sir. I made one or two spares when I was about it, so whatever this bicycle gets up to, we'll be ready for it. We'll teach it to be, um, uh... What's that lovely word of yours, low? Do you mean "audacious"? That's it. That's what the French would call mot juste. Ah, they would. They're always good for a laugh, aren't they, sir? Rather. Mark, what are you thinking about? I'm thinking of a binge in London, blowing ourselves to a week in the savoy, doing the shows. What do you say? I don't say. Why? I don't believe in running away. Running away? From all my responsibilities. I have 3 committee meetings this week alone. Perhaps later on, Mark. Mr. Fargus, ma'am. Good evening, Mrs. Sabre. Good evening, Mr. Fargus. Hello, Mark. Hello, old man. What, no chessboard? I've been waiting for you. Why... why should I ask for a 7? You asked for it. I heard you. Sorry, darling. I'm afraid we've disturbed your shuteye. We're settling up now. Anybody got a fountain pen? Yes. I have. Thank you. You'll excuse me, Tony. Mm-hmm. There you are, Arthur. All yours. Young pelham got in over his head. That's what the shindig was about. Now, look here, darling... I don't like young men losing thousands of pounds in our home. I say, you're not accusing my friends of cheating, are you? No, Tony. I should think not. I went for quite a bundle myself. What's the matter, old girl? Everything, Tony, everything. Think that's big enough to keep the light out? It should. I know it should, but what's the good of that if it doesn't? How much? 2 and 11,3. For that flimsy stuff? I wouldn't think of it. Well, everybody else is buying it since this morning's news about Poland. Poland. And who does Poland think they are to cost people 3 shillings a yard? Think that one out, Mr. Higgins. And, uh, while you're about it, my wife would like another 12 yards of that blackout stuff. Hello, Mr. Sabre. Hello, Effie. Apparently, you and I are on the same errand. Oh, yes. All these rules and regulations. They don't make sense to me. No. Well, that's because the government wants to keep us in the dark. Yes, but... oh, Mr. Sabre. You always make a joke of everything. Ah, Effie, how little you know. Is Bright smile conceals an aching heart. Whatever for? I got married before I met you. Good-byefie. I'll pick that up on my way home, Mr. higgin good, rjsir. There goes the sweetest man in the whole world. I'll take that blackout stuff, too. Thank you very much, miss. &5 At's up? We're going on a picnic. Oh, but I... I've reserved a tree stump, a trout stream, and a lovely bit of grass. Catering by Nona Tybar, limited. Well, I hope it's not too limited, because I'm very hungry. All right, greedy. Here we go. Remember our last picnic? Yes, Marko. Finished? Uh-huh. Oh... there goes Nona Tybar. And Mark Sabre. And Mark Sabre. Having a pretty rough passage, aren't we? Too rough. Too rough for me to bear. Oh, Marko, it's no good. I can't help it. I've tried. I've tried very hard, but I'm just not good enough. Nona. Nona, I... don't look at me. Say it without looking at me. I've reached a point where I can't think of the rights of others anymore. I love you. But you've got to face what it means. Once we take this step, there it is... For the rest of our lives. We'll have to live with the knowledge that we took our happiness at the expense of others. You know that. Yes, I know that. I don't care what happens to the rest of my life as long I can spend it with you. They'll t it, rk people do. You can't expect us to think m of what happens to them than to us. We're human. R, Mr. t ing yr fi. &212to help writ>qjrbrbrr for yo &m on my home to tell Nona I'mrbrbrejoinin re9 oh. I didn't mean to intrude. You know Tybar? Indeed. Indeed. How are you, Tybar? Fighting fit, I hope. Tybar's rejoining his regiment today. PR that th be anoth ni her lse alar goodye, bre. I Tony. And thank heaven r men ready. Odye. , my dear boy. Hello. I've seen Tony. I know he's been called up. The idea of Tony in danger... Knowing I've left him... Terrifies me. I... i don't think he'd try to come back. Marko, you're strong. You can stand on your own. Tony can't. So it... It just can't be. Perhaps it could never have been. Perhaps what has happened has just brought us to our senses a little sooner. I understand. Yes. You always do. You're Marko. When the time comes, I shall join one of the services. Of course. So shall I. I think it'll... Be easier to bear. Easier. I don't think anything can make it that. Did you ever see such hats as that woman wears? One diamond. Never. Like one of those old pictures of still life. 2 dead pigeons, a bunch of grapes, and a pineapple. Double a diamond. No bid. Someone ought to tell her to be her age. "Double a diamond." Oh, dear. I wish I could remember what that means. Why don't you take up bridge, darling? 3 no trumps. 4 spades. 4 no trump. Double. That you, Mark? Yes. Oh. Good afternoon, ladies. Go afternoon. Good afternoon, Mark. Have you, uh, seen the news about Poland? Darling, this is serious bridge. Oh. I only have 12 cards. Can't you even count? Really. I did count. These were all I got. Hannah, see if you're sitting on a card. Oh, how can I be sitting on... ah. Dot look now, but the queen of spades is under the table. Never mind. J here's tea. Thank heaven. You never count your cds. Hi Oh, he does, does he? Oh, yes, owing to the French having got this imaginary line. Maginot line. That's it. George said we can all hide behind that till we're ready and then pop out and do 'em all in. Oh, well, thank you, low. That's very reassuring. Yes, sir. I thought you'd like to know. Mark, I do wish you wouldn't discuss these things with the servants when we have people here. The servants are going to be in it with everybody else... man, woman, and child... before this thing is over. They'll all have a job to do. Their job is to look after us. I didn't spend 6 solid months getting a staff together to have the whole thing upset by a war. Nor did Hitler. Can't you read english? Can't you see what it says? "To be used only in case of enemy action." What do you hop it. Hop it. Hop it. Ff? Don't you know there's a war on? Y live to be 90, but not in Ty. ?21&9t know. &... I've just joined the Navy.

Remember David's lament for Saul and Jonathan? "They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death, they were not divided." I know what it meant now when she called to Freddie. He w the one person she could be absolutely sure of. I know because that's the way I felt tonight... sure of you. I felt... You were the one person I could turn to. You can always feel that, Effie. Always. Mabk, ghen you st out all night, I do thhnk youight led me know yourself. Sorry. Mrs. Perch isone, Mabel. Ede's death was too much for he that's t bad. Bui do think it was veryunyfthat miss Bright to send for you. After all, the proper thing to have done... oh, for Ty's sake, can't you leave the girl alone? I can. Can you? I don't understand Mabel.

Wh? sabrs article in Fargus' rag. Rbdsgceful! No, t I'm qt surpsed. No wonder I can't do anything with my boy. There he is, on his last leave, hobnobbing with Sabre. He's undermining him, I tell you. He's undermining everybody, if you ask me. Have the goodness to open that door. Ah, Sabre, come in, will you? Gentlemen. how's the book going? Oh, fairly well, I think. Perhaps your new book is suffering because of your other writings. I refer to this outpouring. No, I don't think so. You think this is important? Very. Frankly, I don't. Well, I do. Then perhaps you would like to devote more time to it. Would you like to be released from your contract with us? I think we can oblige you. I would not, and may I remind you that you cannot dismiss me except on serious moral grounds, whatever that may mean. It means different things to different people. For instance, this. This is seriously immoral from my standpoint. Then it's a very good thing for me that you are not a court of law. I don't think I shall give you any reason to invoke that clause. If that's all, I'll... one moment, Sabre. Please don't bounce away like that. You know Harold's going on active duty. Yes, he's made a fine pilot. You ought to be very proud of him, Twyning. I am. That's easy for you to say. You're not giving a son, and you're not going yourself. Twyning, that is scarcely fair. After all, Sabre is a man of ideals. Just because he expresses those ideals so forcibly, one need not necessarily expect him to fight for them. If it's of any interest to either of you gentlemen, I tried to enlist the day after war was declared. You did? Well, well. Most creditable, eh, Twyning? I was turned down. Why were you turned down? Heart. Oh, really? Mmm. You look so fit. Do they give you anything to show they turned you down? A slip. Do you, uh, carry it? I don't have to. Nobody who knows me would doubt my word. Anyone else can verify it by going to the medical examiner of the district. It's just across the street, Twyning. Thank you, dear. I must say, a little of this war work goes a long way. It's not so strenuous as actual nursing. No, but actual nursing might be more fun. Some of those convalescent officers are most attractive. Yes, if you could be sure of getting officers. Mmm! This cake's delicious. Who made it, Rebecca? No. Sarah. Rebecca's gone. No! And such a treasure. What was it, drink? No, she was called up. Have you ever heard of anything so provoking? Hello, dear. How are you, Natalie? Very well, except that I've overeaten. This war work makes me simply ravenous. Say, Mark, I've been reading that extraordinary stuff you've been putting in the papers. Well, I hope it's done you some good. What do you think about it? Oh, I think it's just a phase. Well, that's the war for you. The people that never said boo to a goose before suddenly become oracles of wisdom. What is it, low? High's here, sir, in the kitchen. She don't half look hot stuff in her uniform. Oh? I'll go and have a look at her. And there's someone else out there, too, sir. Wants to see you. Who? Effie Bright, sir. Effie Bright? What on earth...? Haven't you heard? I thought everybody knew. What is it, low? She's been turned out... turned out bag and baggage by that father of hers. Turned out? Whatever for? Oh, really, Mark. Must you be so naive? She's going to have a baby, sir. On the wrong side of the blanket, as they say. Well, I'll be getting along. No, don't go now. I think I should. These family crises are no place for a non-competent. I know how you feel, darling... But you can always come to me. Now, ducks, drink up your tea. You'll feel better then. Come on, now. Do as low says. That's the girl. Go on, drink it. Oh, Mr. Sabre, I know I shouldn't have come here, but I had nowhere else to go. My father said... Oh, he called me... Ah, now, now. Come on, let's sit down. Sit down and finish that cup of tea. That's the girl. There you are. Now, drink this. You'll feel better. Come on, Effie. Sarah! I want some fresh tea... If you're not too busy. Try and drink it up. Sarah, stop that nonsense and do as you're told. It's not nonsense. It's common decency. But you wouldn't understand that, not your sort. Leave the house this instant. I'll pay you till the end of the month. Go upstairs and pack your trunk! In me own time! You, all dolled up like a sister of mercy. Talk about the horrors of war. She's one. And what's more, I wouldn't have stayed in this house as long as I did if it hadn't been for the master. Get out of my kitchen. With pleasure. Come on, I'll help you pack. And if you take my advice, Mr. Sabre, you won't be far behind us. I'm so sorry, Mr. Sabre... To cause all this trouble. I'll go now. No, no, Effie, please. You had every right to come to me. Yes. I'm beginning to think she had. I'd like a word with you, Mark. I'll be back in a moment. Now, you stay right there. Mabel, I'd like you to apologize to Effie. Really? I don't think so. Do you expect her to stay in my house? Why, yes, of course, until we can find somewhere else. Why did she come here? I told her once she could count on me. Did you? How sweet of you. What claim has she on you? What claim? Isn't it enough that this poor child has appealed to us in her need... in her urgent, desperate need of comfort and kindness? There's no avoiding it even if we wanted to, no turning back, no crossing to the other side of the street. What a pity you'll never be able to take Sarah's advice and leave me, Mark, because, you see, I'm leaving you. Not because you're jealous of Effie Bright?! Jealous? No, outraged, disgusted, finished. You don't think I'm in love with her? Love? That's too pretty a word. Anyway, it's quite obvious that you're not in love with me, and it may surprise you to know that I'm not in love with you. Perhaps. But all that's got nothing to do with that pathetic child in the kitchen. No? I happen to think that that pathetic child in the kitchen is nothing but an ambitious little rotter trying to better herself. Mabel. Come back a moment, will you? I'll be honest with you. There is someone else. Honest? With me? Can you be? I'll admit it's difficult, but I will be. All right, you've sensed it. I'm not in love with you. I am in love with someone else. I'm sorry, but there it is. I'm relieved about one thing, though, I see it really makes very little difference to you. And the lucky, lucky woman is not Effie Bright? It is not Effie Bright. I'm going now, and I shan't be back. I'll divorce you, of course. And I shall tell everyone exactly why I've left my own house. I'm sure you'll tell it, Mabel. I'm not sure it'll be exact. Good morning, Effie. How are you feeling this morning? Much better, thank you. Good. What have we got here? Oh, kippers. How did you know I liked them? Come. Sit down, and we'll have some. Come on. Oh, I couldn't. I had my breakfast. I had it early. Sure? Oh. Well... Last night I said to myself, Effie Bright, you ought not to have come here. Now I know I shouldn't have. I'll be off as soon as I've washed up. You'll do no such thing. You'll stay till we find the best place for you to go. Come. Sit down here now and have a cup of tea. There you are. Think of all the great decisions that have been made in this world over a cup of tea. First things first. We'll get in touch with this young man of yours. You've told him? I've written. Huh. It's rather difficult these days. Oh, overseas, huh? Want a little sugar in here? No, thank you. Here you are. It's no good, Mr. Sabre. I couldn't tell you his name. I couldn't. Not even you. I didn't think you would, Effie, and I love you for it. There must be somewhere you can send her, someone who will take her in. Have you tried to find a place in wartime? But look what it's doing to your reputation. You're going to ruin yourself in pennygreen. But you know that, don't you? I'm not worried about myself, old man. I'm going to stand by that child. This firm, with its ecclesiastical connections, cannot afford to have one breath of scandal connected with its name. I'm not sure that girl's being in your home for the past week hasn't already damaged our reputation. Restitution must be made. You must turn her out at once. I refuse. Is that all? Not quite, Sabre. You're dismissed. Legal notice of your termination will be sent to you by registered mail. You have violated the morals clause of your contract. I herewith invoke that clause and all that it implies. If you mean that I forfeit my shareholdings in the firm, you'll have to fight me in a court of law. You'll have to prove your case. I should like nothing better. Good morning, Sabre. Oh, look here, old man, I'm terribly sorry about all this. About what, sir? Oh, this scrape your daughter got herself into. I have no daughter, Mr. Twyning. Watch, steady. There you go. Give him this here. It's a receipt for her furniture. I shouldn't have done it. It hers. Her father ge it to her for a wedding present. At's this? Ceived Mark Sabre, rtain goods and chattels belongin to Mrs. bre. There, there, there now. I know where we can get me more chairs and tables. Come on. There's nothing to cry about. I don't understand women. If Mark had 40 women in different parts of London and made nsecret it, nobody would have said a word. But because he takes one poor, abandoned child into his home... into his home! You'll agree it's a bit different. Oh! Can't you see what will happen to you if Mark Sabre continues to live with this girl... And continues to write for your newspaper? Strange. When Mark resigned today, that's just what he said. "I'm harming the paper. I'm undoing the good it's done." Well... Well, I must say he's displayed rare good taste, ich is me than he'done up till no robertn. Here. Edwards. Here. Rimes. Here. Sabre.

No, not for me, neither, it ain't. I want to hear at he's got to say. He's resigned from the newspaper, ain't he? Maybe that says it. But who made him resign? That's what I want to know. Well, there'dirty rk here, if y a me. He been ying thing in that paper, he has. Plenty of thin. Then why hahe stopped he's been stopped, I y. Then why ihe duinus [ll arguing] Evening, Effie. Evening.

I've tried to think that, but not any longer. But, Effie, if your younman... I have nyounman, Mr. bre. It aplain as the no on your face. Ah, I don't believe it. Nobody would be fool enough to give up a girl like you. It... it isn't possible. It happens. Someone you love doesn't love back. That's all. I just want to hear from him again.

Ere uld e t pois I'm very sorry, Mr. Sabre, but there are one two fmalities with which you must comply. They have removed the body to the mortuary... I never, never ould have left her. Why? Why did I leave her? I have to tell you this... why did I leave her? Because of your relationship with the deceased, your presence will be required at the inquest, which will be held tomoji mni in the blue boar at pennygreen. Inquest? Inquest?! Sorry we're late, but the line from town was blitzed last night. All right, inspector. Mr. Sabre, are you legally represented? No. You may be if you wish. Medical testimony has been given to the effect that the deceased, Effie Bright, died from the effects of oxalic acid poisoning. This bottle of oxalic acid, used for cleaning purposes, was found near the body of the deceased in the kitchen of Mark Sabre's home at the crosshores, pennygreen. Can you identify that bottle as the one you sold 2 nights ago? That's it, sir, or a likely facsimile. Who was the purchaser? Here it is in my poison book, sir. Mark Sabre, of crosshores, pennygreen. Silence! Mr. Coroner, sir, I represent the deceased girl's father, Mr. Bright, and with your permission, I should like to ask the witness a question. Very well, Mr. Pettigrew. When you sold the customer the poison, was there anything odd in his manner? Well, eh... He sat down while he bought it. Is that, uh, unusual? Very. Why? Because usually there aren't any chairs there. Silence. Silence, please. That will be all, Mr. broadhurst. William Bright. It was June. Can't be sure of the day. Towards the end, I think. Leastways it was late at night, that I know, when Effie came in. I should have known. I should have realized then who Effie had been staying out with. I say, look here! Silence! But I want to... in the course of these proceedings, you will be called upon to state what you know about this tragedy. Please wait until then. Mr. Bright... Was the deceased the sort of girl who would meditate taking her own life? Never. Never. Had the deceased ever betrayed signs of loose character while living beneath your roof? Never. Never. Have you any knowledge as to whether Mr. Sabre was a frequent visitor at the place of the deceased's situation? Constantly. Night after night he was there. And who else was in the house on these occasions? An old lady, past 70, and my daughter Effie. Do you know who was responsible for the condition of your unhappy daughter? Yes. There. There. And then not satisfied, he took her to live in his house, for everyone to see and point a finger at. Please, Mr. Bright, allow me... I shall not warn you again, Mr. Sabre. Thank you, Mr. Bright. S.j. Gibbons. 5:00 in the morning. 5:00. Spent the night... openly. Excuse me. Brazen. Right in his own backyard. Other occasions. Intimacy. Innumerable occasions. Innumerable. Filth. Living proof. Open association. Open association. Ecclesiastical connections. Highly moral tone. Anybody could see what was going on. Answer, sir! Answer! Reluctantly attribute, base motive. Answer! Undue intimacy. Undue intimacy. Occasions. Remonstrate. The truth, the whole truth. Is it a fact that your wife has instituted divorce proceedings against you? Look here, that has nothing to do with this inquiry. Is it a fact that in these proceedings the, uh, the deceased woman was named as co-respondent? Look here! You keep asking me to look here, sir, but you tell me nothing. I ask you plain questions, please answer them. Is it a fact that these proceedings were served on you in London on the occasion of your flight? Flight. Flight?! Or was it a little holiday to get away from it all? Oh, no, no, no. Then what were you doing in London? I was making arrangements for Effie to leave pennygreen. Ah, and before you left for London to make these "arrangements" to get rid of your obligations to this child, you made a purchase. No. Nothing in particular. Yet you heard Mr. broadhurst, the chemist from fair mile, tidborough, give evidence. Oh, yes. I bought some cleaning fluid. Then why did you go all the way to fair mile on the outskirts of tidborough, when there was a shop in pennygreen? I wanted... I wanted to walk. Let's come to the purpose of this oxalic acid purchase. Cleaning fluid, cleaning fluid. Yes, cleaning fluid. Oxalic acid, a deadly poison. You know. You signed the poison book. What did you want it for? Effie asked me to get it to clean my gray hat. And did she carry out her intention, sir? Did she clean it? You don't appear to be wearing it today. Pray then, where is this hat for which you obtained the oxalic acid? Is it at your house? No. Not at your house? Odd. Where, then? Look here... where, then? Answer the question, Mr. Sabre. Where is the hat? The wind, under a lorry in London. I left it... I left it in the gutter. You left it in the gutter? Stop it, stop it! You're killing him, all of you! Stop it, I tell you! - Silence! - Who are you? I'm Nona Tybar. Everybody in pennygreen knows me. Oh, yes, indeed. The wife of major Tybar of northripps. I was. Major Tybar died this morning. Allow me to offer you my deepest sympathy. Now, if you have anything that would help materially in this inquiry, we should be glad to hear it. By the death of Effie Bright, Mark Sabre lost a dear friend, a friend he was trying to help. She turned to him because there was no one else she could turn to, and because he was the only one with the courage and decency to stretch out a hand to her. But, Mrs. Tybar, this is irrelevant. I have known Mark Sabre all my life. He is a kind and honest man. If any one of you here were in trouble, you could go to him and he would help you. Love, kindness, decency... those are precious things. Don't destroy them, don't destroy them. Mrs. Tybar, this is not a court of law. We are not trying Mr. Sabre. We are inquiring into the death of that unhappy girl Effie Bright. Please take a seat. That will be all, Mr. Sabre. Gentlemen of the jury, you have now heard all the evidence. It consequently becomes your duty to return a true verdict on your findings of fact. Gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed upon the verdict? Yes, sir. In the case of Effie Bright, our verdict is suicide whilst of unsound mind. Gentlemen of the jury, I thank you for your verdict, in which I heartily concur. Yes, Mr. foreman? The members of this jury wish to add their most severe censure of the conduct of the witness, Mark Sabre. Oyez, oyez, oyez. All manner of persons with anything to do with this court before the king's Coroner for this county, touching the death of Effie Bright... Mark, Mark. Nona, go away. Go away, please. You must keep out of this. Mrs. Tybar, it will be better, perhaps, if we leave him alone for a while. Listen, we boys, we're his friends, and we don't believe all this. Mr. Fargus, you'd better do something about it in your paper. Yeah. Yes, I will, boys. I will. You come with me, Mrs. Tybar. Dear Mr. Sabre, you have been my one friend, and in return I've brought you only trouble and shame. Perhaps with me gone, a little of what I've done to you will be undone. I feel I ought to tell you now, before I leave this world, what I never was able to tell you or anyone... the name of the boy is Harold Twyning. He used to be in your office. We had been secretly engaged a long time, and we were going to be married. Then he had to go overseas suddenly, and he was afraid to tell his father. So that was how it all was. And, dear Mr. Sabre, I do trust you to be with Harold what you have always been with me and with everyone... gentle and understanding things. And I shall tell the perches, too, about you. Good-bye, and may god bless and reward you forever and ever. Effie. Cab. Tidb, to ftu, & t Mark! , Twynin twynin ie me to speak tyou abt your s! Bre. Sabre, have you heard? Heard? [Obs] killed.
