I sometimes wonder nowadays, if I'm working with a newbie or an auteur. I'll give you two weeks, but this is your last chance. If you can't give him anything by the end of the month, both of us are out. We brought in a film fest prodigy, but development expenses pile up, and get nothing in return. You sure you can have something ready? Yes. I believe in you. I don't like that story. Yeah? Got anything else? I'm not so sure about this one... Come on, spill it. A friend heard it from a neighborhood friend. There was a graduation screening for the film majors at his college, and half of the people ran out of the theater, and one died of heart attack. What was it about? Well... The student who made it was investigated, and he said it was made by... a ghost. A film made by a ghost? Yes. What's the title? He didn't tell me. How many years ago? I don't... Can you get in touch with him? I've lost touch with him. Actually, I just heard that he majored film at Daejeon University. Daejeon University, film major. Daejeon Bus Terminal Who are you? Hello. Are you Prof. Jo Mi-kyung? So you directed that short film. What brings you here? Didn't a student make a horror film as his final project? There are a few students who shoot genre films. The student claimed that it was made by a ghost. What's the title? I don't know the title... Which year? I don't know that... So you came all the way on a rumor about a ghost-shot film? You really don't know? This year marks my 10th year as a professor here, I've heard of no such thing. Perhaps it was over 10 years ago. The film department here started 10 years ago. Unfortunately, you wasted your time. If you can't give him anything by the end of the month, both of us are out. This is your last chance. The more I watch Nolan's films, the more amazed I am. Who cares about Nolan? Your shorts are so dull because you don't accept Nolan. Don't talk about my stuff. Always guessing and shit. But you don't like 'Sicario', 'Arrival'... Dude, tell him about Nolan. You ruined your short by working with Nam and wasted $30,000. You can't talk about Nolan like that. Are you... Daejeon U film majors? Yes, we are. Shall we play a game? What game? Tell me a scary story. Take a shot if it's not scary. If it is scary... If it's really scary, I'll grant you a wish. A wish? Like anything? FYI, 10 brownie points if it's a real life event, and 20 points, if it's about this school. This school? Our school? Miss. Okay, Sung-tae, you first. This is something I heard from my senior, there's an abandoned theater near our campus. An actress named Soon-mi was burned to death while making a film and became a ghost. - She did... - Take a shot. Take a shot! - Drink it man! - Shot! Shot! Who's next? Me! Me! Sure, Jung-min. This was 10 years ago. A film student made a horror film as a graduation film. You know those graduation screenings? I heard his film was so scary. People passed out and someone died of heart attack. That scary? Do you know what the director said? He claims he didn't make the film. But a ghost made it. A ghost made it? How? The crew were waiting to shoot in an abandoned theater, and the ghost appeared and snapped their arms, then twisted their necks, and she was killing them... I was trying to tell you about her story, too. Soon-mi. Sung-tae, don't interrupt Jung-min's story. Right! It's because I know more about this story. The ghost asked him what kind of film he wanted to make, he said he wanted to make the scariest film ever. So the ghost knocked him out... I'm talking here, you stupid nerd! Let go! I bit my tongue! Guys! How could you fight in front of her! I bit my tongue! You deserve it! Mi-jung. What happened afterwards is very important. What I mean is, The film 'Warning' was accepted to a film festival.

Piss off. I said piss off! What do you want from me?! Just tell me! I'm going nuts... Who are you? Who the hell are you? I'm... sorry... I was just curious... What? I doubt that. Where did you find this? Now I get it. You're trying to make a film by editing this. Soon-mi in that theater... No... It can't happen again. - It can't! - No! - No! - Please! You know what's more horrifying than death? Living in horror. That's the scariest film of all time. If you end up like me, you're better off dead. Shit, he's crazy... No, no... Mi-jung, what's wrong? I think it's been formatted. What? No, I risked my life to bring this here... Mi-jung... Try again. No... no... Mi-jung! What are you watching? Did you recover the file? How's my film? Is it scary? Mi-jung! Are you okay? Hard drive, what happened to it? I'm running a data recovery software. I recovered one file so far. Yeah? Let's see. Who... are you... Cut! That's it! Thank you! Great work. - That was great. - Move aside. We'll contact you in two days at the latest. Thank you, good bye, Take care! How was she? She seems pretty good to me. She has the right look for a horror film. I didn't like her, her frown was... No, something's missing. DP, how was she? I'm more concerned about doing the audition without a script. Jae-hyun, when do we get your script? Hold on for a bit, it's almost done. It looks like a making-of video. Why do you want to make films? Me? To make horror films. Why horror? There was a horror film that saved my life. A horror film saved you? Don't you want to know how it saved me? I had a tough time in high school. I was actually bullied badly. I was beaten daily, and wanted to kill myself. I was hospitalized more than my time in school. One day, 'The Exorcist' was playing on TV. You know, the scariest film ever made. I couldn't take my eyes off it. My hands were shaking, and tears rolled down my face... It felt like my heart was beating again. It was terrifying... but the pain suddenly went away. That's when I made up my mind, I wanted to make a horror film a that can help someone forget about their pain. Eh? Power outage? When did we first meet? I was assistant director on your first short film. So, 10 years ago. Thanks for staying by a selfish gal like me. Come on. When I look at you... I'm envious. You're really cool. You live each day for your dream. Dream... I'm just crazy, I really am. By the way... I actually read your script. I'm sorry. How was it? What? How was the script? It was good, it was, but... the protagonist was exactly like you... And her friend's like you, right? Do I talk that much? Anyway, that script is a work of fiction. Okay. What happens to the director and her friend in the end? In the end? It's a horror film, so definitely not a happy ending. Okay. This place would look dope at night. Just a bit further. It's exactly how I imagined it, it's perfect. Very nice. So we're shooting a fake doc like 'The Blair Witch Project'? The story goes like this. College students invite a friend to an abandoned theater, and shoot him freaking out, and a real ghost appears. Do we have to star in it? Yeah, maybe. Just decide. I'll look around and decide one by one. This is amazing. - Come on, man. - I'm sorry. What was that? Set of 'Warning' - 1980, screening cancelled Soon-mi Holy cow... Isn't this place amazing? Incredible... Are we skipping lunch? - Where are you going? - Just looking around. So awesome... Who are you? Film, world's scariest film... Who is he talking to? World's scariest... I'm sorry, Gwang-bae. Why are you apologizing? Wasn't there a rumor that this phase is haunted? Yeah, I heard that. Ghost of a burned actress. Her name is Soon-mi. Screw that, I'm more concerned about the dust in there. Jae-hyun! I gotta talk to you. Sorry, I got stuff to prepare. I'm gonna go back. - Jae-hyun! - Where are you going?! Hey! Who are you... Soon-mi... Soon-mi... Ghost of a burned actress. Her name is Soon-mi. Soon-mi in that theater... This is what I was going to tell you, Soon-mi. Mi-jung, I'm here. 'Warning' 'Warning' Directed by Kim Jae-hyun This making-of was the film? Gather around. What's that? I saved this from my last production. I thought we could use it as props here. Look, open it here. And then... you'll see this flint. And use this, one, two. Nice, eh? I think it smokes up too much. Don't like it? When the director gets here, I'll ask him if we'd need it. Even so... keep one each. Um, okay. I think I'm okay. Take it! It's dark in here! Jae-hyun! Is everything ready? Yeah, but when's the actress coming? Wait a bit, she'll be here. Jae-hyun. I gotta get some exterior shots, there's not enough. - Don't we have enough? - What's with him? Where is he constantly running off to? Are you all right? Get me some water. Ji-su, he's not answering? My battery died... I'm gonna step outside for a bit. Eh? What's wrong? I just turned it on. What's going on? Hey... Did you even check this? - Ji-su, you okay? - Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Ji-su, don't move, stay where you are. Young-min, bring me the flashlight! - Where is it? - I saw it back there... Then check the light in front of Ji-su! Okay, okay. Ji-su, don't move, stay right there. Wait a minute. I can't see anything... Young-min! Young-min! Jo Young-min! Gwang-bae... Is this... is this blood? Jae-hyun, are you outside?! Jae-hyun! Young-min... Young-min... Please, please... Help me... help me! Who are you? Who are you! Can you... see me? Who are you? Stay back... Why are you here? I, uh... The thing is... Shush. Did you think you could fool me in that body? You're Soon-mi. What are you talking abo... I can't live like this anymore. I need to end it all. Director Kim... I'm not Soon-mi... I'm human! I know, you can't be killed with these things. I'm sorry for stealing your hard drive from your home. I know everything about the film! She did it all, right? She killed your crew, screened it in theaters... She did it all! I know you didn't do any of that. So stop this and let's leave here together. I'll explain everything to others. I'll tell them you're innocent, you son of a bitch! I'm innocent? You know everything, I know you do. From where they died... I brought back the tapes. And I edited it. Then I screened it in the theater. You are indeed insane... You... made my life into a horror film. It's time to end this film. Shit. You're... insane too... Come! Come at me! Hello? Oh my, director Park. Why is it so hard to reach you? I believed in you, didn't I? Did you almost kill yourself trying to write the script? I'm fine. Did you see my texts? When are you available? Great work on the script! Everyone at the studio loves it! Tremendous work, can you come here tomorrow? We gotta draft the contract, so bring your seal. Contract? Of course, what's wrong? I understand. You're insane too. I just got a call from the investors. They saw the rough cut, they absolutely love it. This place freaks me out, production design here is... Just out of curiosity... how much of the film is based on real life? Who knows... 'Warning' Premiere Director, over here please! Here! Smile please! Lights went out in the theater, and the audience disappeared... And then... Help me... help me! Sir, to the bus terminal... Your call cannot be connected... Daejeon, can you get to Daejeon? Where are you? I'm inside the theater. Why? Why?! Mi-jung, are you in here? - Joon-seo, Joon-seo! - Can you hear me? Joon-seo... Mi-jung! Mi-jung! Mi-jung!
