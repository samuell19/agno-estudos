Since when did your couch become a hospital? You don'’t understand. He saved me. Saved you from what? Two guys tried to kidnap me. Are you telling the truth? Why would I lie about something like that? This is why I told you to get bodyguards so stuff like this wouldn'’t happen. I Michael I don'’t need a bodyguard. This isn'’t a discussion. Because of who we are because of what our names are because what we have people are always gonna be trying to take something from us. I know I know I maybe been a little too hard recently but with mom in the coma dad out of the picture you the only thing I have left. I don'’t know what I would do if something happen to you. Ok. I promise. Now Why is there an unconscious boy sleeping on your couch? Listen I'’m not judging. I'’m I'’m just asking. I mean as long as you guys been safe. No, Michael! It'’s not like that. Ok?! Let'’s go wake him up I'’d love to meet your boyfriend. Wait, no! Where did he go? I don'’t know. Ice cream? Casey this is my brother Michael. Mister Parks? Mister Parks is your brother? Oh my God, I'’m going to have a heart attack. Ok relax. Mister Parks It is such an honor to meet you. I am a huge fan. I want to shake your hand since forever. Well Thank you for the admiration, It is a pleasure to meet you Casey. Oh no the pleasure is all mine sir. I didn'’t know you were such a big fan of my brother. Of course I am. Everyone should be. After all He is one of the heroes who helps find and protect the reader. WHAT? What? Whatever you are smoking, keep it away from my sister. MICHAEL? Oh no no actually I was sent here to protect you while you find the reader and help save New York. Why didn'’t you tell me my brother was apart of this? I had no idea Michael Parks was your brother. This is just This kid is crazy. This is just an elaborated scheme to get money from us. You are not going to outsmart Michael Parks. Michael, would you just listen to him? I don'’t want your money, I want your help. Help with what? And if you say "“Save New York"”, I am going to slap you. MICHAEL! Would you listen for once? Can you let go of this egotistical rich kid personality of yours and be my brother for once? Fine. You'’ve 30 seconds. Oh Ok a comic book here we go. This is you. That doesn'’t look anything like me. That looks exactly like you. Well then I'’m gonna sue them. There is a way we can still save New York. If we find the reader he can decipher the book of commencement. Oh Now we'’re getting biblical. No no no, it'’s not like that. It'’s actually a comic book. That holds a key and like riddles to all this stuff. But the reader can decipher it. Listen There is so many plot holes in your story it'’s insane. What are you? A writer? Trying to pitch me a movie trying to get me to produce it or something? I am not a writer. That'’s even worse than you just crazy. I mean first of all a comic book, how cliche What are you? 9? Second of all, there is no proof of any of this. I mean, half of population of New York doesn'’t even make sense. It'’s pathetic. MICHAEL STOP IT. Will you help us or not? You are not actually buying into this, aren'’t you? I had no idea a person can be so mean. Casey don'’t mind him. All he cares about is money and business. The Michael that did care died ever since he took over that stupid business. The comic book shop I work at just got new shipments. Maybe we can find the one we are looking for there. Oh you are not going anywhere with him. You'’re not my father. No, but I am your legal guardian you'’re gonna do what I say. What was that? What if those guys are back? You two, stay here. I'’m gonna go check it out. Ok, let'’s split through the fire escape. What about your brother? He'’ll be fine. But what if those guys It'’s not them, its Kitty. Who? Come on, let'’s go! You know Ok so If you are a billionaire why do you work at a comic book store? I'’m not a billionaire my family is. Yes but you know what I meant. No I don'’t want to depend on my family'’s money. I can survive on my own. I mean that makes sense. You'’re pretty cool Molly.

I'’m sorry. I don'’t remember what happened The last thing I remember was you, Molly. We were in the garden You were helping me pick tulips in the back yard. And then it started to rain and we ran inside then you asked me what happens when it rains? I told you It rains because mother earth is sad. Then you ran outside and started dancing I asked you what you were doing and you said I am cheering her up. Maybe you should get some rest. You are right, I am feeling a little tired. You would think for being asleep for a year I would have enough. I'’m gonna go lay down. I love you. And I love you both so much. And I am so glad to be back here. I can'’t believe it.

Through the wall, cool. Yes. Run through the wall. Awww Not that wall you idiot. Hannnn You said this wall. No I I don'’t have time for this. You said What? Kitty? He'’s just joking. But he didn'’t sound like it. Casey will be fine. Ok? Just don'’t piss him off Ha noted. So? Who wants to play Syntha? Do I even want to know what that is? Ah Where are we? This is where you'’ll learn to master your full potential in just hours. It'’s called The Devil'’s Lair That is a dope name. It'’s hidden from humans. Only the only people who can get inside are the ones I allow inside. So why is it called the Devil'’s Lair? Casey There is more to this world than you know Now Stop this man who calls himself the Airman. Right? Isn'’t that just like the dumbest name you can come up with. I mean I got Ink powers What am I gonna call myself? Inkman? Right. If you defeat him You'’ll be part of something great something you can'’t even imagine So defeating him is like an initiation? Exactly. You see that guy? He'’s taking the test. Test? What test? To be fit to be a hero. What does he have to do? Fight the other guy and win. If he can'’t? He dies. He dies? Hold up I didn'’t sign up for this Look Do you really think you'’re gonna beat a creature like Airman by training with sticks? No Every battle you must learn to fight for your life you must release yourself from the chakras of fear and self doubt Once you do that then you'’ll see your true form You'’re right. I mean If Airman is not gonna fight fair not gonna show any mercy I should prepare for it right? Yeah, yeah, ok! Listen Casey you pass my test you'’ll be the first member of this generation of superheroes. Members? There are others like me? Of course Every generation has their own superheroes to protect earth from different creatures. Hold up so let me get this straight I got my powers from a comic book the one that Airman stole is that how the others get Yeah? Correct. Every comic book his rightful owner in due time. Ok Let me ask you a question So if we are like forming this super team the next generation and all that Do we get costumes? No Why not? Because they'’re dumb. Real heroes wear costumes No real heroes are there saving animals from people. I think a costume would look cool. I want one. Fine. Have a costume. Awesome. Why do you want to be like those superheroes you read in comic books? Honestly? Alright Look I was not popular in my childhood. I didn'’t have what people called friends. In fact I was very outcasted. I was a nerd. And People kinda treated me like crap for that You know? I would go to school Get bullied and got even beaten up from time to time. But you know, comic books were always there. Comic books were the one kinda stable thing. They were like They were like my escape. My break out from reality of terribleness and all. You know The guys in those comic books. The The big tough looking spandex wearing long cape flown heroes. They were yeah They were like I idolized them. So why do I want to be a comic book hero? Cause I want to show other outcasted reject kids like me that heroes are real That I'’m real and I can protect them. I don'’t know. OH MY GOSH! Is he? Yeah He'’s Han Bummer. It'’s time. It'’s time, time for what? Don'’t die. Don'’t die? Sam? Sam? Ah Oh come on Molly, once again? Wait? I'’m winning? I didn'’t even know we were playing. Where is Casey? Molly! If he'’s hurt in anyway I swear to God. He'’s fine for now. Katherine a moment. What does that mean? I want to know what happened to Casey. I'’M TALKING TO YOU! Are you done? Good. Molly what is wrong with you? You have no idea what these people can do. Did you see what he did to me with his mind before? I'’m sorry I was just worried about Casey. I know I'’m actually starting to like the kid But We have to be careful here this world is very new to us I didn'’t even know powers existed 2 hours ago. I know I'’m just overwhelmed with all of this. I know Me too Huh How are you doing by the way? I'’ll be fine I mean about mom. You'’re right Mickey. Mom died the minute that car crashed That thing wasn'’t our mother. Molly I remember she used to hum this song to us right before we fell asleep right when she tucked us in. Sometimes I close my eyes and I hum that song and I see her face. The real her I'’ll be fine I'’m I think I'’m finally at peace with mom'’s death. I'’m so sorry you had to see that. I would give anything I know Thanks. You know, I know I have always said I would protect you I haven'’t done that. I haven'’t been the big brother you deserved. Maybe but you'’ve bee the big brother that I needed. You may be the most stubborn arrogant big brother out there. But you'’re always there when I need you the most. And I always will be. Me too We'’ll be a family again. I promise. So What do you think of Casey? I like him. He's very enthusiastic. Yeah He really want to be a hero. Well if he doesn'’t die he'’ll be the first in a very long time. What? What are you talking about? What did you do? You said he needs to learn in hours. What did you do Sam? I put him in the mirror of death. Huh Great now he'’s probably dead Relax He'’s not ready for that Sam. Do He just got his powers. Do you think his enemies are gonna wait for him to be ready? Damn it. You'’re right. What'’s wrong? Huh Nothing Sam what is it? When we were in the Unknown World I heard things Rumors I always thought it was just a myth humans like to believe But now I question is it really a myth or What myth? The Eclipse. Alright Was this your card? No? Ok let me try again. Oh hey guys Who is up for a game? Sure! Interesting. What'’s happening? What the f... He is the mirror of death. He sees deep into your soul and he conjures your inner demons in front of you. One way to defeat him is to kill him and free yourself from your fears and doubts releasing your true powers. Why isn'’t he fighting? I'’ve never seen anything like it Instead of sparring with him he spared him. And embraced him. Amazing. That'’s Casey! So why do you call this the mirror of death?

Thank you Josh. And tell Tell Molly that I love her with everything that I have. And let the guests know there is a new superhero in town. His name is Ink. Will do. Good luck sir. Hey luck is not in my vocabulary I'’m Michael Parks don'’t forget it. May I have everyone'’s attention please. First of all I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight. I'’m Josh Newman spokesman of Michael Parks. Unfortunately Michael is not able to be with us this evening and I'’ll be speaking on his behalf. As of yesterday Michael sold his company E.Y.E Although Michael doesn'’t have his company. Now Michael has one big bag of cash. He'’s Michael Parks after all. The last 24 hours how can I say this if you only saw Michael. Michael told me he has learned a couple of important things from all of this. Number one: Family. Michael has learned the importance of family and how much he truly loves his little sister Molly. Molly you'’re real badass. Michael loves you and he'’ll always be here for you. Secondly: Michael has learned how important it is to dream. If you have a dream go for it. Don'’t listen to anybody don'’t even listen to some rich pretentious preak just fight for it chase your dreams. Molly I'’m very happy your dream of reconnecting with your brother came true. One last thing before I end I want you all the rest peacefully knowing that there is a hero watching over all of us watching over our families and watching over our city. His name is Ink. LET'’S PARTY! I knew you could do it. Thanks. What'’s that? Huh it'’s an app Michael set it up for me. It looks into police alerts tells me when there is crime nearby. I gotta go! Woah Good luck!

How did they find me? No way! The 8th right hand man of God herself, right here on earth. Traitor Samuel Pikows. Namasta. How did you find me? None of us were able to locate you in the Unknown World. So we lost your trail. But you made the grave mistake of coming back to earth. Your head is wanted through out the entire kingdom and is our biggest bounty. I, Namasta the 8th right hand man of God am here to take you back to the kingdom. I cannot leave I'’m here to train this new generation of superheroes. The lord of the shadow world is powering up and will destroy all of earth. We just destroyed one of his loyal soldiers who calls himself Airman NONSENSE!
