What's that stain? What stain? - That stain, on the wall. Indeed, there's a stain. How? It must be a damp stain. It's a strange shape, isn't it? What shape is it? Yes, you're right. It looks like South America. You don't love me anymore. Listen, we're late. I'll wait for you downstairs. Hurry up. There's a stain on the wall. - What stain? - On the wall, behind me. How can I see it if it's behind you? Madam's not transparent. Yes, it's a damp stain but I don't know what I can do about it. I'll send for a plumber. You can go, thank you. You, policemen. Join us. You're as young as we are and we're fighting for the same ideal. Don't stand there like puppets. It's the system which must be changed. It's the system which goes against you and us. Try to understand that. It's important for everyone. It'll be an unthinkable struggle. It'd be like as you came to blows with my comrade who holds that placard. Or the other one. Join us. You'll be on the right side. How can't you understand that we're doing this in your interest only? Don't listen to... Don't obey your superiors. Take off your uniforms. Become free men. Listen to that racket. - Afraid? Your students, perhaps. If they see you, you'll be lucky. - I don't give a damn. They're throwing rotten eggs. I wouldn't like to ruin my fur. Let's hope they're hard-boiled. - Listen, Andrea. What's with you? Afraid of those out there? No, I don't feel well. So, we can go. Ah, yes. Shall we go? Join us. Don't toe the party line. Stay near us and we'll make it quick. Don't go to La Scala. Stay here. That way you'll beat us up harder! Angrily! With hatred! Listen ,Andrea. I... I'm going to put the car in the garage. How was the opera? Have you eaten? - Yes. How did the evening go? A shining, sumptuous and stylish evening. The biggest names in business. Among others, we noticed Professor Mucci with his kind wife. How come you weren't there to protest and throw rotten eggs? I wasn't there because I'm here. To protest? Exactly. To protest. Let's go to bed. I'm tired. Let me. Laura's tired. She wants to go to bed. Please, will you open the window before going to bed? Or else, it'll smell of cabbage. What did you do? - I was reading a bit. - What? Mao's thoughts? No. Charlie Brown's thoughts. - More or less... He's much more dangerous. Indeed. He gnaws away at the system from within. - Like woodworms. Well, no more left, I think. Where's Andrea? - Upstairs. Ah, Dr Paolozzi. The wife of our general manager. Shall I go with you? - No, I know the way. Next week, there's a 4-days long vacation. Let's go to Amalfi, like two years ago. Sit. What did you do, Laura? Are you mad? Did you see her face? You look pretty in that skirt, Delfina. Want some? What's going on? What's wrong? Nothing. You don't feel well? - No, I'm fine. You're not dining? - I'm not hungry. Do have dinner. I'm going to bed. Slept well? Can I have breakfast with you? What happened last night? Nothing. Want some coffee? What is it? Andrea doesn't love me. I don't exist for him anymore. When did you know? I knew. And you? You love him? He's my husband. - What does it matter? Those by your side are the ones you know less. I couldn't live without him. No, Laura. You've to save your marriage. - When your husband doesn't see you... Nonsense. Sex is not everything. There are many other things, you know. Besides... Try to react. You must not accept the situation passively. Find something. How? I don't get it. You've got to deal with it. - How? - The marriage has to be sustained. So, found anything? - Here's a rather good bull calf, madam. Yes, but we won't be swindled like with that red one from Ireland? Well, I hope not. Rossi made us spend more than 5 million last year for a bull calf, considered the greatest mounter in Lombardy. Instead, it was a weakling. Mind that it's a gift, this time. I don't want to give a bad impression. You mean we need to try it beforehand? - Try it on whom? - What are you saying? Well, see about it. - So, this one is taken. Here comes Andrea. We were talking about men. - Actually, about women. Whatever thing you talk about, you always talk about the same thing. I've some work to do at home. Shall we go? - Are you coming? No, I've got to talk with Rossi. As you wish. Do you want me to dry you off? Finally. Where are the other two? - l thought they were already here. Anita has no sense of time. What would you have? A cup of tea. - Mario, a cup of tea. Shall we sit over there? They won't find us anymore. - Anita would find me even in hell. I don't how she does that. She loves me. - And you? Want to know if I love myself too? Andrea says you can't love anybody. You love yourself only. Perhaps it's true. A gift for Anita? - No, just rimmed cartridge loaded with buckshots. They're used for boars. I haven't got to that stage with Anita. I only shoot at the game. Do you love her? Very much. Yet you cheat on her. Don't you think it's... - No, it's not. First of all, love is one thing and sex is something else. Secondly, Anita knows. Thirdly, she also cheats on me. Fourthly, I know that. Fifthly, she knows that I know and I know that she knows. Sixthly... Shall we meet one afternoon? Aren't you Andrea's best friend? Seventhly, friendship is one thing and sex is something else. You don't really love your husband. You think? - lf you loved him, you would be able to drop one of your prejudices. By going to bed with you? - Perhaps but it's not that. So, shall we meet one afternoon? Hey! Watch out. Carlo is married. Well, haven't you heard of group marriage? You're always late. Sorry, dear. Shall we go? - Yes, let's. This one is yours. What a morgue. Come on, wake up. Let's play a game. Let's play the family who's more afraid of scandal than death. The parents find out that their only daughter, a sweet girl... - That'd be me. You. She's... lesbian and wants to be a painter. Ah, what an imagination. What about me? - You'll be the waitress the girl has fallen in love with. What? A lawyer's daughter, falls in love with a waitress? Why a lawyer? - Well, l don't know. lt just occurred to me to say that. No, a lawyer sounds perfect. Well done, Andrea. The essence of conformism. So, shall we begin? Come on, let's begin. Listen, that way it sounds stupid. Instead of being a real daughter, she's been adopted. And she's not lesbian. But she tries to seduce both her mother and father. It's too unreal. But, if you like it better... Here I am. I'm ready. So, do we agree on the upright lawyer? Rather, a lawyer, so moralistic and upright, must have a hidden vice. Which one? She could be the daughter of a lawyer who is an old brothel goer. He's afraid they might catch him, chasing after prostitutes. I'll be the prostitute. The mother has no vices? To me, she too has some hidden vices. Of course. Like all respectable ladies. Which vices? - She likes to drink, for example. Why are you standing there? Come on, it's your turn. What does she do when drinking? - Nothing. She dances naked before the mirror. What are you doing? You've to dance naked before the mirror. I can't... Come on, it's a game. Tell her it's a game. No, I don't want to be naked. - Stop it. Don't be the usual killjoy. We're all friends. You'll enjoy it, too. Okay, if you don't want to. Stay the way you are. Now, dance. Before the mirror. Imagine that you're drunk. I'm the mirror. I'll mimic your movements. Come close to the mirror. Kiss it. You're drunk. And a bit narcissist. Well done. You were wonderful. Let's do it again. Maybe, the photo didn't come out well. - It's the best one. Come on, my camera's ready. - Let's do it again. Enough! I don't want to. - Why? - You've no sense of proportion. You're leaving? I hope she didn't get offended. But... What came over her? What have we done? Nothing. Leave it. - What happened? I don't know. - We'd better go to sleep. - She must be nervous. It's really absurd. We had a great time. Wow. - Let me see it. - Not bad. - Give it to me. Listen. Are you coming to the battue with Laura? - I don't know. l think so. See you tomorrow. - What shall we do? - I'll be the Statue of Liberty. Give me the camera. Wait. There, hold still a moment. That's it. I simply forgot that your father was a lawyer. That's all. You used not to forget about it. Besides, it's not that. You shouldn't allow it. I don't want to be dragged into their obscenities. You should've said something. You should've taken me away. You don't reply? I'm talking to you. Listen, tomorrow will be a tiring day. Let me sleep. You know I've always been on your side. Everything you say about education is right. And if violence is needed, well then, be it. I won't surely back down. You must look for comrades. Join up with the labourers, the workers. I'm not one of those professors who you have to fight against. I'm neither authoritarian nor paternalistic. Go away, you fool. Go home. You can't do everything on your own. You're a scant, weak force. The professor body... The professor body is a body full of crap. Calm down. Just a moment. No unrest. Do not provoke the police. From now on, we won't accept any professor or assistants. We don't want them at the meetings. Remember that we ourselves must solve our problems. Leave peacefully. Don't forget it and keep calm. Can you give me a lift? Get in. No use. What can we do if we're not united? Listen to me. We won't achieve... - Without making any fuss, he took her away. No-one is against the professors. They're stupid. Who cares? We don't blame them. We blame the system. And what do you do? Nothing. I bet that you're a bourgeois. With a big house and a bunch of stupid friends. Indeed. Exactly. The most unbearable type of woman. You do nothing and have no courage to do anything. Where are we going? This is your house. Your parents live here. Listen, I'm leaving. Don't you worry. Wait a moment. Are you sure there's nobody? Don't worry. Want some whiskey? Do you know what my husband does? - I don't care at all. He's a professor. So much the worse. He teaches political economy. That pain in the neck of Mucci? - Yes, it's him. He plays innocent then he takes the money from companies. Jeez! I always forget. What? - To buy a portrait of Nixon. Will you drive me home? If you don't want to, call a cab. I'll drive you home. Why do you have to do that right here? It's nice and warm here. Blasted idiots. Who? The students. - What did they do to you? You left the car with headlamps on. They accuse me of being authoritarian. I put my intelligence in their service. In the service of industry, too. Ifs all very well for you to talk. - You too. There were many of them. The college was full... of placards. There wasn't the slightest chance of entering into a dialogue. One chap in particular played them all off against me. What was he doing? What was he like? - A hack. A demagogue. Not unpleasant. Some kind of a revolutionary. At some point, obviously, the loudspeaker's batteries ran out. If only you had seen the demagogue's face. He stopped working without the bullhorn. - So what? The Beatles, too, use amplifiers, right? Poor Andrea... Poor little man. What are they doing to you? Everyone is against you. I went to the college to talk to you. I was there when they were booing you. Lovely sight. Very decent. I saw the student who was against you. I asked him for a lift. I was at his place. Why did you go there for? To be with him. Would you like a drink? Like that? All of a sudden? Why? You liked him? I don't believe it. Nor does Andrea. Me neither. It's Anita. Listen, you must do me a favour. I told Carlo I'd spent three days in Geneva and you should take me to Milan. Please, darling. Do it for me. Don't say anything to Andrea. I don't want Carlo to find out. Yes. Of course. This morning, I thought... There. Now, this one will be born and it'll be a good and lovely baby. Everyone will be delighted with him. Then he grows up. And one day he says to me: "Mother, what are you living for?" It's over. He has become a stranger. It's not possible. - Not necessarily. But it's very likely. - You could've thought of it before. The pill. It can happen. May l? May I see your doctor's note, please? You're the lady with triple apical? Would you like to go now? What I care about the most is Carlo. We'll make a baby, later on. Why did you go to his place? I don't know. I can't explain it. You always do wrong things. You have slim ankles. Much slimmer than mine. I don't think they're slimmer than yours. Let's check the wrists. They're slimmer than mine. Look. Don't you see I'm cutting? Why don't you untie your hair? You really don't let me work. You look prettier now. You should use a different make-up. You really want to change me? Maybe Andrea will like you more. Why don't you make up your eyes with brown pencil instead of the black one? Well, I'm off to bed. You are not? - Yes, as soon as I finish something. Do you like it? Let's see. Why are you laughing? ls it that ugly? - No, it's beautiful. Let's try to interpret it. It seems like you feel lonesome. Very lonesome. Your nature is contradictory. Shattered by endless conflicts. Looks like two different women fight between themselves to push you in two different directions. But you're unable to choose. To decide. That's why you're so pessimistic. You see everything in black. You've to decide. One of these two women must be eliminated. One of us is in the way. You've beautiful eyes. I can look at myself in them. Shall we go? - Yes, let's. Go to sleep. It's late. I forgot to say goodbye to Laura. This is for you and Lucia. What is it? A hippo? - No, it's a ring with a ruby. For your collection. Where's the ring? - You'll have it soon. How distrustful you are. This is foryou, Laura. It's a bracelet. Besides, tomorrow is your birthday. And the last card is for Walter. This is an ox. It's a bull. I think you forgot an important detail. You're not tired, are you? Try not to make much fuss. - Don't worry. It's because of Mother. She's a light sleeper and the slightest noise... Doesn't it bother you? - Why? It doesn't matter at all. After six years of marriage, if there isn't any novelty, any excitement... And Walter? He's not bad either. - No, I wondered if he knows. Well, once... Once or twice we did what Carlo jokingly calls "The Villa Franca square". - Clearly, he knows. Isn't it funny? No. - The usual moper. Do you have an aspirin? What's wrong? You don't feel well? - I've a slight headache. This is the kind of cure you recommend to me to enliven my marriage? Well, it's always... It's always better than the aspirin. I'm off. Are you going downstairs? We'll catch up with you later. How do you feel? Better, thanks. Do you want me to rub your temples? Anita told me you were here. Laura's got a headache. Shall we go home? Let's not go through the hall. Too many people to say goodbye to. I'll go get the car. Let's go. A hot drink? Maybe I drank too much. - tea will make you feel better. How do you feel? My head's spinning. I feel sick. Help me. She doesn't understand a thing. Happy, happy birthday. Here, I've brought you a present. Not like that. You're still sleepy. I will show you how. There! You like it? - It's nice. It's beautiful. it suits me. I want one like this. Yes, it really does. Why don't you keep it? If l need to know the time, I'll come ask you. It's your present, not mine. Isn't that right, Andrea? Do as you want. Take it. What? - It's yours. No, keep it. How do you feel? - Much better. Get ready or we'll be late. Right away. Wait. This car is faulty. Lt starts all by itself. I've never seen you hunting. Are you a good shot? - You'll see. Look how they eat. They're so voracious. You haven't seen a piranha yet. How come you're so late? You ran into fog? I'm going to change my jacket. - The girls are coming. You've arrived, at last. We've been here for an hour. Noticed the weather? If the ladies wish to... - Laura. You're not coming? The last one. Please, don't smoke during the battue. We're sinking. What kind of cartridges are these? - I won't shoot, anyway. I couldn't. It'd be as though I were shooting against a pan of me which runs away. Instead, I should feel hatred. Go to the edge of the forest, that way. Then, move upwards. Mr Andrea will go in that direction with the lady, down the riverbank. Mr Walter will go to the number 5 and Miss Laura to the number 6. No. Give the n.6 to Walter. I'm going to n5. Number 6 is the best. Walter is a washout. I'm not in the mood today. I'm going to the n5. I do need a cigarette now. Will you light one for me? - Of course.
