WE WILL NEVER DIE Mom, how long will we be staying? I don’t know how long this will take. I thought the hotel would’ve been bigger. We are here for your brother. I’m just saying... ...I like the hotel. I’m sorry. I’m a little tired. Tomorrow will be a long day. What’s this? A Bible. There's one in every hotel room. We first came with your brother, looking for an apartment for him to rent. And we stayed here, in this hotel. We had to sign the lease the next day. He was anxious. And stayed awake all night reading the bible. From beginning to end. I was tired, and fell asleep. When I woke... ...he was there... ...sitting in a corner... ...reading... ...with the little light that came from the bathroom. Go brush your teeth, so we can go to bed. M’am, I’m going to need that you sign here... ...for your son’s belongings. Please. Thank you. What happened to him? Where did you find him? I cannot disclose information about the circumstances of his death. He was found on a rural area near the village. A local man found him. What do I have to do now? Now you only have to wait. Your son is in the morgue, awaiting for the autopsy. Once that it's done, they will hand over the body. When would I have a chance to see him? You can only see him when it's over. You know how slow things are here. You're going to need some patience. These are your son’s belongings. Last night I dreamt that we were on a holiday. We went to a restaurant. And then we had ice-cream. We were having a good time. Then I woke up in the hotel. I didn’t know if it was real or if I dreamt the whole thing. I was so tired. I could’ve slept for a lifetime. Mom... ...what's the eternal life? I don’t know, son. I guess that some day, when we are dead... ...we’ll meet with our loved ones. We would hug them... ...and tell them all the things that we couldn’t tell them here. You believe that will happen? Sometimes I do. Some other times I believe that everything just ends. That a black curtain falls on us... ...and everything darkens. All is black... ...silence... ...and calm. Like in a nap. I don’t know which one I prefer anymore. And what about Alexis? I guess he'll be there... ...waiting for us. And what will we do meanwhile? Keep on living, in any way we can. You would like to live in a bigger city, don’t you? I don’t know if I could keep living alone the rest of my life. I like where we live. And I wouldn’t leave you alone. Eat your ice-cream, it’s melting. I’m not hungry. Can I have it? Sure. M’am, I’ve called you for two reasons. To give you my condolences. And to give you a leftover paycheck. Even though your son had asked for an advance... ...I’m going to give you his full paycheck. You can count it if want. - There is no need. - Well, it’s fine. Thank you very much. I only have... ...words of praise for your son. He has been a fine employee. A great coworker. Always very efficient. Very effective, and responsible. I can only say he has been... ...a great collaborator. Well... I would like you to take some things he has left on his locker. I’m going to talk to Luciano, so he can give them to you. It’s ok? Just a second. Hi, Luciano, how are you? The lady and her son are going over there now. Please, give them the locker stuff. This kid’s stuff... yes. Yes, they’re going right away. Great, done. Thanks. I don’t have nothing else to say. I wish you good luck. Anything else you need, don’t hesitate in calling me. You have my number and address. Anything else, just call me. Ok? Thank you very much. And for this kid, send it to me when you can. If he wants to work with me, he has a job. Thanks. Come on! Here. Thank you. Keep them. Thanks. You’re welcome. M’am! Do you have the book? I want to tell you something. Alexis loved to read. One day... ...I couldn’t find him anywhere. I went to the office. I looked all over the place for him. And finally found him in a green... ...laying down in the field. He was having a seizure. I ran over to help him. And... This book was the only thing I could find... I put it in his mouth to keep him from hurting himself. Was he sad? No, he wasn’t sad. He enjoyed this view much more than I do. I’m building a machine. A machine? Yes, a machine... ...that runs on the Cosmos’ energy. How does it work? It’s a machine that helps us... ...to tune into each of our energies... ...to tune in to the energy that surrounds us. It helps us to be better. I thought that... ...it may help him. What are you doing? You are heavy. Are we going? I don’t know if I’m ready yet. It’s getting late. Let’s come back some other time. Ok, let’s go. What are you doing? I’m trying to organize me. Here. Maybe you can buy yourself something. Can I keep it? Sure. Don’t put on that much. You don’t sweat yet. Save it for when you are older. I like the perfume. It’s fresh. Yes, I was a little dizzy, but I’m better now. I don’t remember having given him this medallion. Look. It has some initials. Maybe it belongs to his girlfriend? I didn’t know he had a girlfriend. He told me a little bit about her. I’m going to need your signature here. Did they already tell you the cost? Yes, they did. - I have to pay you? - Yes - Is it everything? - Yes. You chose a nice place. That's all for now, thank you very much. No, thank you. Let’s go. COULD THE DEAD LIVE ONCE AGAIN? WOULD YOU SAY YES, NO OR MAYBE? We went through a difficult time... ...with your son. Last year... ...he came to visit one day. My baby was in his crib... ...and got a ball stuck in his mouth. He started choking. Alexis, desperate... ...brought him to me. I was doing the dishes in the kitchen. I took him... ...and run off... ...to the street. Right at that moment a car passed. I got in front of it and made it stop. I asked the driver to take us to the hospital, desperate. He drove very fast. In the clinic they took the ball out. Then, they took my baby to a nearby town. He was 21 days in intensive care. My baby. And Alexis was there, during all of it. I believe in miracles. That night I saved my son’s life. But I’ve lost some of my faith now. And now, what are you planning to do? Same as always... There is not much to do around here. And you? How long are you staying? A few days more... ...until I fix everything up. Someone grab his head. Do you have him? Let’s go! Let’s go! My name is Sebastián Santana. - And what do you do? - I tame horses. Taming horses, ok. Can you explain me what is it about? You have to spend a lot of time with the animal. Caress it, so it can lose its tickling. You take away the horse’s tickles? In order to ride it, the horse... ...has to lose its tickling. After that you can ride it. What were you doing out in the forest? I was checking on some bird traps. - Birds? - Yes. Can you recall your itinerary since you left? I went looking for my horse, then I saddled it. Then I went to the brick furnace. Then I kept going up to the lagoon. I checked on a bird trap I had there. - On the lagoon? - Yes. How do you know where you've left the traps? I can guide myself. I know the field. Then I went into the forest. I went to the ruins. And that’s where I found him. I got scared. I thought you had left. I got out to smoke. Were you afraid? I don’t like being left alone. How can you think that I’d leave you? You can come see him now. I want to go too. He can wait for us over here. Come. Hereby certifies that, in compliance with said court order... ...the respective autopsy has been performed. It’s the corpse of a 22 year old man... ...found deceased out in the open in a rural area. No signs of violence were found on his body. The history of the deceased indicates that he was under treatment... ...for epileptic syndrome. According to the internal examination, the following drugs were found: Lamotrigine, Phenytoin, Retigabine, Ethosuximide. He took those by his doctor orders. Yes, I continue. Given the circumstances and background of the young man... ...the results of the preliminary autopsy point to a massive intake of drugs... ...as a possible cause of death. What does it mean by that? That... ...given the amount of drugs he took, it’s very likely that it was intentional. Mom... ...what’s the matter? Nothing. Don’t worry. It’s only these days. Everything is hard. I’m also sad too. I don’t want you to worry about me. I’m big enough, I can handle it on my own. Son... ...why did you want to see him? I’ve never seen a dead person before. Mara, are you there? Yes, I’m here. May I read you? Yes. I’m walking in a battlefield. I don’t look sideways, I find it hard to breathe. I think that my teammates are dead. I can’t stop. I have to fulfill my mission. Metal dragons roar, far away from here. I feel my heart beating inside my body... ...as if I were underwater. Most of the sounds rumble like punches. I’m not afraid now. My steps are sound. One, two, one, two. I’m not thinking, just walking. My blood fills up with adrenaline. I have to leave this place. I have to find the escape route. I’m not afraid... ...I tell myself to find courage. Dragons howl and vomit fire curtains. I have nothing to fear... ...my courage protects me. I’m not afraid... ...my body answers to me. I’m still here... I can still move away. I’m not stopping. I have the euphoria that comes with survival. The urge of being the last one to tell the tale. The air feels weird. Smoke gets into my lungs. I find it hard to breath, but I keep on. I take a step, and another, and another one. I’ll make it if I keep on. My legs are strong and tough. Outside, a peopleless world awaits me. I’m not scared of being alone. Best to be alone than dead, I say to myself... ...and find the strength to keep going. The dragons are suspiciously silent. They give up fighting. If I get out I’ll be safe. Outside, I’ll have to be cautious. If I get across this atmosphere of death and smoke bubble... I’ll survive. Outside, I’ll find some calm. I have many thoughts. Right now, I have to calm my mind to keep walking. To think or to act, my body decides to move forward. I have no other option than to move. Staying still would prove to be fatal. I’m not afraid now. Now, I walk. Hey! I’m looking for my mom. Is she here? No. But you can wait until I finish this, and I can help you to look for her. Come in. That, which you are feeling and seeing, it’s called Scalar Energy. It’s also known as Cold Energy. This spark that you see here, between this two nails... it’s the same one that you see when a lighting... ...strikes the ground... ...but in a very small scale. A very tiny one. Now, let’s test it. I need you to hold them, one in each hand. Those are the electrodes. Close your eyes, and try hard to focus. And... ...have an intention on your mind. Something that you really want. This machine will amplify that intention... ...and will send it, as a vibration, to the Universe, shaping its energy. And mom? In the room. She fell asleep. Hey! Take care of her. Mom. Mom... You fell asleep. How did you get here? I woke up and you were gone. I looked all over for you. I got to Luciano's house and he brought me here. He's outside. I’m sorry, son. I didn’t want to leave you in that hotel. I had to see about the apartment. Luciano told me that he could help us with his things. Alright. Give me a moment. - Here, I’ll help you. - Thanks. Hand me that box. Are you ready? Shall we go? Do you feel ready to drive? Yes. - Do you want to feed them? - Yes. Will you be alright? Yes. I’m going to be fine.
