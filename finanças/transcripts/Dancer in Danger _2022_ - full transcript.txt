[instrumental music] [music continues] [birds chirping] Mom! We're home. - Stay for dinner? - What are you having? - What're we having for dinner? - 'tofu burgers.' - My, why she like tofu? - I don't know. Uh, I bet my dad would let us order pizza. - Hey, mom. - Hmm? Can I eat at Lina's tonight? - Homework done? - Of course. And it's not your cooking, which I love.. Mm-hmm.. It's just, Lina's house is better for shooting And this one's really important. And why is that? Well, for the past 10 days we've been posting Our dances on pixapost. And this is the tenth and final one! And Reagan is crushing it! Right now, she's tied for first place. Oh, that's exciting. So, what happens if you win? I get the title of charity ambassador, which means They donate 10,000 dollars to the charity of my choosing Which is obviously.. The happy feet alliance. And a 10,000 dollar matching scholarship. Wow. That's big. And how do you win? Well, my tenth video needs to get the most "likes" And if that happens, then pixapost pays us both. A literal "win-win." I like it. (Lina) oh, my god. Reagan! Your number ninth dance just went number one! - Oh, my gosh! - Okay, girls. This is where I'm gonna really sound like an old person But your self worth is not determined By the number of likes that you get on a dance video. - Mom. - I'm just saying. I hate that the world is defined By the number of "likes" that you get. - I know you do. - We all do. Anyways, I'm very proud of you With or without likes, or scholarships, or any of it. Honestly, Mrs. Humphries, your daughter is a gift. I'm like the klutziest person on the planet, But when she teaches me, I can actually do it. You know what? You should be in the tenth video. You know, like a special guest star! - No, absolutely not. - Yes. Absolutely, yes! Okay, we're leaving, but.. - Okay. - Almost forgot. Hmm. This is interesting. Look at this. There's a dating app on your tablet. Who would've done that? [chuckles] oh, Reagan. Seriously? Come on. I made you the sweetest profile. You should check it out. - Your catch! - I love you. Love you. Let's go. Pizza! Pizza! Pizza! Pizza! Pizza! (Reagan) 'I found the perfect song for our dance today.' 'just wait till you hear it. It's gonna be amazing.' You sure he's okay with us being here? Yeah. He's a divorced chem teacher. What else does he have going on? Dad, Reagan and I want a pizza. Can we order it? - Dad! - Oh my god, lee. Stop screaming. We've to hurry before we lose the light. Dad! Hey. What are you two doing here? I thought you were doing your little dancey thing at Reagan's? "dancey thing." really, dad? - Hi, Mr. Peters. - Hey, Reagan. - Uh, can we order a pizza? - Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah. Um, do your thing. I-I'll order it. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just, um, you know deep into paper grading mode. So, wasn't expecting a pizza dance party. - Veggie supreme? - Perfect. - Got it. You girls have fun. - Thank you. Um-hmm. So lucky, you get pizza every night. Only when I'm here. When I'm at my mom's, it's a lot of fish. You ever miss them being together? Not anymore. It got really bad with that court case. They both just love you so much. And I can't blame 'em. Even if you do snort when you laugh. [chuckles] hey! Alright. You ready to do this? I cannot wait to see you win this. Can't wait to see us win this. Reagan, no, no, no, no! Now is not the time to experiment With me in a video. Come on, please, I really want you in it. Plus, I need you there for moral support. We're doing this one all in one take. - No cuts. - No cuts? No cuts. You with me? [chuckles] Alright, insane person. Let's do it. Here we go. Hey guys! This is it. Number ten of the pixapost charity challenge! And today, we're bringing you the real deal. We're doing this one all in one take. No cuts, no gimmicks, no tricks, so, you better buckle up! We're hitting you with the "seven rings mash" That we've been working on, and it's a little bit tricky So, I brought Lina here to help. - Are you ready? - Mm-hmm.. Here we go! Five, six, seven, eight. [music on stereo] - Good! - Whoo! Oh, my gosh! Okay, we rocked it. No, no, no, no, no. Don't even look at it. - I know you. - Are you sure? Come on. [crickets chirping] [instrumental music] [clanking at distance] - Honey? - Yeah. - Oh! - How'd it go? It was great. My phone died on the way home now. So, I just need to charge it and upload everything super quick. Okay, well, it's getting late, so, may be it can wait? Um, yeah. No. I'm just gonna charge it and upload everything And then I'll crash, okay? Mom, it was so good. We created something.. ...Unprecedented. That's amazing. [intense music] - I can't wait to see it. - In the morning. Power outage. Grab the flashlight? - Um, where is that? - Um, right here. Okay. I'm gonna go figure out what's going on with this breaker box. I'll be right back. [door creaking] [intense music] [school bell ringing] Hey, Reagan. Didn't you get my text? - Well.. - Did you post yet? No. Stupid power went out last night. I didn't even get a chance to review. - Are you serious? - Yeah. And my phone still dead. So, I'm gonna do a low key Charge during study hall and figure it out. Such a rebel. Oh.. - Hey, Reagan. - Hello, Samantha. So, today's the day. - You ready? - Absolutely. I'm super excited, I'm gonna post tomorrow. - How about you? - Well, let's see. I picked up three new choreographers on my feed. One from Willard studios in new york. She's a big fan. Also, child unity project, my charity of choice Just so happens to be run by Charlene Allan. Do you know who she's married to? Mona? Charlene Allan, director of child unity project Who, happens to be married to Geoffrey Allan! The director of admissions from Willard studios. I've idea what any of this means. It means, if I win... - When you win. - Yes. When I win, not only will his wife get a check and myself A scholarship, he'll see my application and bam! I'm into Willard and my future begins. - Our future. - Chaz got into vanderton. - Big v. - That's so "charitable" of you. I've wanted to go to Willard since I was 7. So, this scholarship is my ticket out of this town And onto Broadway in new york city. Yes, we all know where Broadway is But thank you so much, Samantha. Which is where we're going to spend our lives...Together. Hmm. Isn't that touching. I feel myself start to tear up a bit. Honestly, Samantha, I'm not in competition with you. I really do feel like there's enough room for all of us. (Chaz) 'uh, not really.' Sam and I want a future. Her winning this challenge solidifies everything. So, don't get in my way. Let's go. - Okay, was that for real? - Yeah. - That really just happened. - I don't know. ♪ I see I see baby ♪ ♪ I see I see I see baby ♪ ♪ come here come here ♪ ♪ baby I'll be waiting ♪ ♪ come here come here ♪ ♪ I'm anticipating ♪ ♪ what are you doing to me? ♪ ♪ he kept me waiting and waiting ♪♪ [indistinct whispering] - What? - It's literally your dance. Like, you have to say something. What the hell do you think you're doing? - I asked you a question? - I'm not doing this. Oh, I know what you're doing and it's not gonna work. - You're stealing my dance. - No! I'm not! So now you're a thief and a liar now? - What? No! - I saw your phone. The choreography is identical. No. You guys are being insane. - Yeah, but stop. - Just let me look at it. Stop! Stop! Aaah! [phone thudding] That was an accident. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Let's go. I swear I will kill her if I don't get that scholarship. [instrumental music] (female #1) 'thanks for coming in. We'll work on your leg next week.' 'alright, bye.' Just one second. Hey, honey, what is it? Everything okay? Uh, yeah. Sorry to bother you at work. - Hey, Reagan. - Hi, Jim. - How's the dancing? - Can you, can you? Thank you. - Samantha broke my phone. - Samantha from school? Yeah. The one from the dance contest. I don't know what's gotten into her But she's just acting insane. Okay, what happened? Samantha and Mona think that somehow I stole their dance For my video, but that doesn't even make sense Because all we're doing is re-creating dances That already exist. Anyway.. ...She grabbed for my phone, it fell and it shattered. Oh, it doesn't sound like she intentionally Meant to break this.. Okay, yeah, but the point is that it's broken And I need it fixed, I need to upload this video tonight. You can just download it from your Icloud when you get home on the laptop? No, I can't. I tried that last night and then my phone died And the electricity blew and.. Mom, you just don't understand, everything I've worked for Is in this video, and I'm so close. And it would mean so much to happy feet if I won. And it could help you with the burden Of college and paying for... I don't want you to worry about that. Okay, well, I am. Okay. I will get it fixed. Deal? I'll take it to the phone repair place after work on my way home. Okay. - I love you. - I love you. Thank you. - I'm sorry that I'm a pain. - You're not. - Okay, thank you. - Okay. - Everything okay? - Shattered phone. Hmm. You know, she's just too hard on herself sometimes. Yeah, well, she's driven. Whoever she gets that from? - Whatever! - Hmm.. [intense music] [laughing] you scared? Did you get it fixed? Oh, hi mom. How are you? Oh, I'm tired. Oh, well, you know what? I did make you dinner. You did? Yeah, I even took the liberty to organize Your whole closet based on the latest trends. Really? Did ya? That's so sweet of ya. Sorry. Hi, mom. I actually did make you dinner. And the trends are gonna have to Wait till the next time I act like a brat. Oh, you are not a brat, you're the best daughter on the planet. It's a bit of a stretch, but I will take it. And yes, I did drop it off at tech-medi clinic. It should be ready by tomorrow after school. Thank you, mom. You're the best. [phone ringing] Oh, hey, Jim. - Hi, Jim. - Yeah, no. Yeah, no, that's a great idea. Sure. What time do you want to pick me up? I can't believe yearbook took so long. Right? And we don't even get credit for it. Still, looks good on college apps, right? - This is true. - Alright. I gotta go. But I will call you when I get my phone. - You don't need a ride? - Nope. - Mom gave me her car. - Nice. Alright, well. Let me know when you post. - You parked on the front? - Yeah. Okay. I'm in the back. I'll call you soon. (Lina) 'bye.' [Reagan grunts] [car keys clanking] [grunting] [siren wailing] (female #2) 'okay, so, this attack happened' In the parking lot of the high school? Yeah. In the back walk by the bleachers. And there was just one assailant? Yeah. From what I saw. So, you said they wore a ski mask. Could you see if it was a male or female? Honestly, I couldn't tell. The only glimpse I got was of the hand When he was grabbing my bag, the gloves. (female #2) black, possibly leather? Yeah and there was, um, like a band. Or a bracelet around the wrist. Like a black bracelet or leather maybe. Okay, well, anything else you remember, give me a call. I will, thanks. [door closing] So, you really have no idea who did this? - No idea? - No. If I knew anything else, mom, I would've told the detective. I know. It's just you're all I have, honey. - I can't do this without you. - I know. - But I promise, I'm fine. - I know. But what if you weren't? - I mean, what if it was worse? - Mom, stop. I promise. I'll be extra careful. Okay? I'm not going anywhere. I had Jim pick this up for you. What is this? It's a temporary phone. I can't handle not being able to be in touch with you. Especially now. Will it teleport me back to the 90s? It's just a temporary phone until you get yours back. I'll take you tomorrow after class. Well, tell Jim I say "thank you." I will. I like Jim. You guys have known each other for a while? Mm-hmm.. Go do your homework. Fine. Yeah. No, I know. No, no. She seems pretty freaked out. She even got me a burner phone. I mean, I think she might destroy the school Tomorrow in her tirade. (Lina on phone) don't worry about the challenge stuff. You have until midnight tomorrow to post. It'll be fine. I can't believe Samantha hasn't dropped hers yet. [Lina chuckles] as if she cares about something charitable. Yeah, well, right now, I'm trying to figure out Why I'm even doing this. It's for happy feet, right? I'm just glad you're okay. Hey, do you ever think about your dad dating again? You mean, like with your mom? Oh, my gosh. No. I mean, I like your dad, it's just.. They're definitely just friends. No, I just meant.. I don't know it just seems like my mom is lonely sometimes. - I wish she had someone. - 'yeah.' I mean, I want the same for my parents. I love 'em both. I just want 'em to get along. Yeah. They'll figure it out. If they could relax for a second they'd realize There's enough of me for everybody. Thank goodness because I'd be lost without you. Hardly. Alright, so I'll see you at school tomorrow. Actually, my mom has a meeting with principal Jackson In the morning to talk about what happened, so.. Lovely. Alright so I will follow the sound of tornado Beth. [chuckles] sounds good. See you then. Bye. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hey, guys. This is it. I know you're expecting dirt But this is a different kind of "tea." It's about truth. My truth. Eight years ago, my dad Andrew humphries and I were In a horrible car accident. He was the greatest dad ever and.. Thank you for not yelling at principal Jackson. I am an over-protective mom, not a heathen, honey. Besides, they are increasing security So, I'd call that a win. I mean, I get it, I just don't want to be known as "the girl who got attacked", ya know? But you were attacked And we can't pretend that didn't happen. - Hmm. Yeah. - Right? Yeah, I know. [laughing] - Who's that? - Samantha. The girl that broke my phone? Do you think she had anything to do with the attack? I mean, she's intense, but she's not that intense. Okay, well, just, stay away from her. And stay away from them. Just stay home, forever. Please. - I know you're worried. - I am. But can we turn it down, just for a teeny bit? - Okay. I'm trying my best. - I know. Thank you. I love you. I gotta go. I love you too. (kyle) Beth! - Oh. Hi, kyle! - Hey! What are you doing here? Other than mortifying my daughter and creating enemies? You almost sound like a parent. No. Did something happen? Yeah. It's a, it's a long story. Oh, you wanna grab a coffee in the teacher's lounge? You don't have class right now? - Free period. - Yeah. I'd like that. Great. (kyle) yeah. I'm just glad that you're both okay. - I mean, are you okay? - No. Honestly, I'm still a little shook. You know, it's like the older I get The more freaked out I am about her safety. Well, you almost lost her once And then losing Andrew at the same time, I.. I'd say under the circumstances you're handling it like a champ. Well, I don't know, I guess. I mean, does it get any easier? Nope. I am also the dad who checks on his sleeping daughter At least six times a night. How's Karen? How are things with you guys? Don't you guys have a hearing coming up? Yeah, she, uh, she pushed for an extension. Probably just to make things more excruciating. Tell you the truth, Beth, I've been Lina's Sole parent for nine years. And Karen chose to travel the world for her career. Then all of a sudden she just quits her job And wants to take Lina? I don't understand it. No, I mean, I think she just wants to spend more time With her daughter before she goes off to college. Well, can't you guys just work it out? Well, apparently not without a judge and lawyers. Well, speaking of which, I've got a, uh Arbitration meeting next week. Could put in a character witness statement for me? No, no, it'-it's fine. I'll do whatever I can to help. - Of course. - Thank you. And you know, if there's anything you need I'm always here for you. - I appreciate it. - You bet. Okay. Back to the grind. - Ooh. - Oh, how's your knee? Oh, it's stiff. Who knew a torn meniscus would take so long to heal. Yeah, well. Have you been doing your exercises? [bell rings] Saved by the bell. Oh, hey. Thanks for the talk. It's nice to know I'm not the only over-protective Paranoid parent out there. Oh, well you are definitely not alone. Hello? Did you hear anything I just said to you? Reagan. Hello. Earth to Reagan, what are you doing? Look at Samantha's wrist. You see that? Okay. The attacker was wearing a leather kind of band bracelet Just like that. Wait, look. Look-look-look. [indistinct chattering] Chaz has one too. (Lina) 'can we take that to the principal?' - Or the police or something? - I don't know. But, I mean, it's worth a try, right? - Yeah. - 'hey, Reagan.' I just heard. I'm sorry that happened to you. Yeah, you look really broken up about it. - Nice bracelets. - Huh, okay. Thanks? We were just so excited because Sam's likes Went up like like a ton in the past couple of weeks. Mona, come on. Reagan's been through a lot. Hey, you're right. Sorry, Reagan. Oh, my god! Quick. Grab your phone. Let's go live and tag the challenge, cool? And...Yeah. Go. Hey, guys, sorry I've been mia For the 24 hours, but guess what?

How was your day? It was fine. Thank you for answering my 16 phone calls. Did I get you in trouble? Not yet, but if that continues.. I know. I'll chill out. Hey, Jim and I had got Chinese food for lunch. We brought you back some kung pao chicken. Mmmm. You and Jim, huh? That's enough. Come on, let's go get your phone. Oh, mom, I can go get it myself. Absolutely not. I will take you. [phone ringing] Hey, Jim. What? Is she okay? Did she hear a snap? Okay. Yeah. Just come grab me. Sounds good. Thanks. Is everything okay? A client, she fell down her stairs. She's at the hospital. Jim's gonna come and grab me. Is she okay? She's in her 80s. I don't know. Listen, you can go and get your phone. But I need you to call me the moment You step into that phone shop. I promise. I'll be fine. - Okay. Be careful. - I will. - Promise? - Promise. - Love you. - I love you too. [intense music] [engine starts] Seriously? - You need help there? - What are you doing here? Oh, just wanted to make sure you got your video in on time? Oh, no. You dropped your stuff. - So, you guys stalking me? - Relax. I know the guy at the fro-yo shop. All the free non fat I can eat, thank you very much. - I gotta go, babe. - Call me later. Shouldn't you be prepping for your big announcement? Right, it's almost 7:00. Shouldn't you be getting ready? I was coming to get my phone. Oh, no, and the shop's closed. Oh, shoot. What are you gonna do? Aside from being eliminated from the competition? Are you guys always just so.. Where are my keys? - Did you guys take my keys? - Don't look at me. Why would we have your keys? Okay, look. This is actually serious to me. This isn't about clout or popularity Like it is for you guys. This organization means something to me. So, can you guys just give me back my keys. Whoa, Reagan you need to chill. Seriously. - She'll call mommy again. - Let's see. - Good luck with that. - You're done. - You just don't know it yet. - Leave me alone. Look, I know you won't recognize this number But when you get this, pick me up on Walden Heading towards my house from main. [sighs] [tire screeches in distance] (Beth over phone) 'hey Lina, did Reagan stop by your house?' - 'have you heard from her?' - no. I haven't talked to her since this afternoon. Okay, um.. Can you do me a favor? Um.. 'can you go to the phone shop on Walden?' She was supposed to be back an hour ago. She took the car there and.. 'I don't want to leave just in case she comes back.' - Of course. - 'I know.' It sounds like I'm being paranoid It's just with the attack and everything I just feel worried that she might not... (Lina over phone) 'it's not a problem.' She was probably just eager To get her stuff online. - I'll bring her right back. - Thank you. (Reagan over voicemail) 'look, I know you don't recognize this number' 'but when you get this pick me up on Walden' 'heading towards my house from main.' [intense music] I don't understand. The car is here, but she isn't. (Lina) it says they closed at 6:00. She wouldn't have made it here on time. 'so, where is she?' Excuse me. Sorry, we're closing. Please. Can you just take a look at this? Look at this picture. She was here about an hour ago. - I don't think so. Busy night. - Please. This is my daughter. She didn't come home. Look, lady.

What are you talking about? On Reagan's post, you wrote "find your keys yet, loser?" What did you mean by that? Look, lady. I don't know what you want... I'm Reagan's mom. And I wanna know what you meant by that post. We didn't mean anything by it. Yeah. We were just having fun. What did you mean by "the keys," Samantha? - She dropped her purse... - yeah, and we took her keys. - But it was just a joke. - Where is my daughter? - What do you mean? - How would we know? (Mona) the last time we saw her was outside of the fro-yo shop. - You were there? - But we didn't do anything. You took her keys. Give her the keys, Mona. - Sorry. - Seriously, it was just a joke.

What's wrong? - You haven't heard? - Heard what? Reagan is missing. Lina hasn't told you? No, she was asleep when I got home From my conference last night. What-wh-what do you mean missing? What happened? - No. I can't. I just-I can't. - Okay, come on. Let's go talk inside, okay? So, is there anywhere else she could've gone? Your house, it's the only place that she goes. - Nowhere else? A boyfriend? - No. She doesn't have a boyfriend. Unless she's keeping one from me. - Did you two have a fight? - No. Never. And you talked to Lina? She doesn't know where she is. She went to go pick her up last night and Reagan was gone. Anything else at all? Samantha and her friend. They stole her keys. They were the last ones that saw her. Samantha Barnswood? The things that they wrote on her social media were so mean. Well, I mean, you know, Samantha she's a little self-obsessed But I, I can't imagine her being dangerous. Someone is trying to hurt Reagan And I don't know what to do. I called the police. They say that it's too soon to send out a search. Okay, well, we'll just put together Our own search party. Okay? I'll put the word out and come by your place later. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey. Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. (Samantha) help find Reagan. We need to stand together you guys.

You've been weird and shut down for a long time, like I don't know what's going on. Help find Reagan. And follow me, Samantha b for updates on how you can help. (Samantha) 'help find Reagan.' We need to stand together, guys. Oh, hey, hey, here you are. 'help find Reagan.' My best friend Reagan humphries has been missing Since last night and "some people" think That giving out green ribbons just makes up For months of online stalking and harassment. (Lina) 'if I had been the last person to see Reagan' 'I wouldn't be promoting it with green ribbons.' Samantha b is out for herself. Please do not fall for it! And I'd think twice about having This kind of person as an ambassador. Remember Reagan. Remember Reagan. It's really important. Remember Reagan. Remember Reagan. Remember Reagan. You're disgusting. [scoffs] whatever. [eerie music] [intense music] Lina. What the hell is this? It's the truth. I'm sure you wouldn't recognize it though. You're basically accusing me of having something To do with Reagan disappearing! Do you? If you blow this challenge for me, I swear, I'll... What? Make me disappear? Don't play stupid, Lina. Daddy's not here to protect you and I know You're tired of playing second fiddle to Reagan. What are you talking about? She's prettier, smarter And more popular than you. You hang out with her for the status. I mean, face it. You're a clout chaser. Maybe you made her disappear. - She's my best friend. - Sure. Just like Mona's my best friend. But there's always a number one and a number two. Right, number two? - Just shut up! - You better watch your back! Stop looking at me. [metallic clanging] [intense music] [rattling] [music continues] Please. Please just, please just tell me why I'm here. I don't understand. I don't.. Please, please, let me out!

There's already search party from the clinic looking for her. I know, I just.. I don't know what she's going through, right now. So.. - She's gonna be fine. - Yeah. Someone, somewhere must've seen her. Any word on the cell phone yet? I've sent it out to a data recovery specialist and, um Haven't heard back so.. Okay, so do you guys wanna start in your office, And then, on at the main street. Yeah, that sounds good. (Lina) 'hello, Beth?' Hi, honey, I'm here. Hey! Sorry, I'm late. Um, I can handle these! All of 'em? Yeah, I put out a post online And everyone wanted to help. I've half the school waiting in the parking lot. Oh, honey, thank you so much. I don't know what I'll do without you. We're gonna do this. We're gonna get her back. Come here. [instrumental music] Okay, alright, I'm taking these. I will see you guys later. - Okay, hon. - Okay. Come on. Let's go find her.

This isn't happening, is it? She's at home, everything's fine. This isn't real. I don't know life without her. I can't do life without her. Beth, you're not gonna be without her. We're gonna find her. - What is that? - Ah, man. (Beth) 'you got a ticket, huh?' It's her school I.D. What-what is it? - What does it say here? - Don't read it. - Let me see. - Don't read it, Beth. Beth, don't read that. Beth! No, it's-it's not true. - No! - It's not true, Beth. Beth. No! It's not true. It's not true. [Beth crying] [clanging] [instrumental music] Look, I don't-I don't know what you think that I saw But I really didn't. I promise I didn't see anything. Wait, no, please, please, please. Please, come on! [screams] Someone help me! Hey, you. Hey, dad. (kyle) 'I thought you might actually eat' 'if I brought you some pizza.' How you holding up? Honestly, I feel awful, like I'm stuck somewhere Between crying and screaming. I just want her back. Yeah, I know you do. She kept saying she had this big secret she was gonna reveal And I have no idea what it was. Like, what if it put her in danger somehow? I can't imagine Reagan being in a dangerous situation, can you? The only thing I can think of is this stupid contest. Samantha's been like a crazy person. The whole thing just brought out the worst In everyone except Reagan. And do you really think Samantha would do something like this? I don't trust her, dad. She is the one with the most to gain From Reagan disappearing. She was so proud of that last dance And I got to be in it with her. And now no one's ever gonna see it. We're gonna find her, okay? [sighs] I promise. Come here. [instrumental music] I love you, kiddo. Love you too, dad. Eat your pizza. [engine revving] (Beth) 'thank you.' You know, you really shouldn't be alone right now. I'm fine. I just need a minute. Alright. Well, I'm five minutes away. So if you need anything, just call me. - I will. - Okay. Thank you. - Text you in a bit. - Alright. [intense music] [door creaking] Reagan! Reagan! Reagan? [music continues] [music continues] Hello? Hello. Whoa! [breathing heavily] [crying] [siren blaring] (male #1) '...On you and your neighbor's property.' Give me a call there if there's anything I can do for you. Or if there's any other issues again. We will. Thank you, officer Cartwright. Have a good night. You okay? Sorry, that was really stupid question. You wanna go inside? I need to be alone. I'm sorry. Beth! Beth, wait! Wait? Wait for what? She's gone, and she's not coming back. Don't give up, alright? This isn't... Why did I let her go? - Beth. - I should've gone with her. I knew it wasn't right. Beth! I let this happen. This is not your fault. Oh, but it is! It is my fault. No, it's not, Beth, alright? You're an amazing mother. I've seen it for years. You're the most incredible mother That anyone can ever ask for. And one mistake just takes it all away. That's not true, Beth. But it is true. I'm sorry. [instrumental music] [latch clanging] Please. Please just-please just tell me why I am here. I don't understand. I don't know why-why you're doing this. Please, just tell me. Just, I don't understand. Wait, wait. Please! Just let me go! (Samantha) 'well, remember Reagan.' 'thanks.' 'okay, you're good, you're good. That's good.' 'remember Reagan, take a ribbon.' Remember Reagan, take a ribbon. Okay, we need more people, like, it's class time, ain't it? - Yeah-yeah. I'd be good though. - Okay, yeah. Hey, remember Reagan. And follow me at Samantha b For updates and how you can help. - Just pose. - Ready for the update. (Mona) 'yeah.' Hey, guys, it's me, Samantha b. We are still looking for Reagan. Please keep your eyes and ears out there. And remember, take your ribbons, and remember Reagan, okay? - 'no, that was perfect.' - remember Reagan. I surely have a couple left. Remember Reagan. And follow me at Samantha b for how you can help. Why are you doing this? You didn't even like Reagan. Well, you think you've cornered the market On caring about people? Remember Reagan, take a ribbon. What does that even mean, remember Reagan? You're acting like she's dead. What are you hiding, Samantha? Look, I have double the followers you do And they're helping spread the word about her. So maybe instead of fighting, we should be Working together on this? Oh, now you wanna be a team? Um, hey. Oh my god, mo, this isn't about you, okay? It never is, is it? What are you talking about? Sometimes, you're just so clueless. I'm clueless? Really. Film your own posts. Fine. I will. And I'm not clueless. I notice you sneaking off with your new boyfriend. - I see things, Mona. - Whatever. Fine, enjoy you're nonexistent little life. You're unbelievable. Oh, come on, stop playing the saint. Excuse me? Whoever took Reagan didn't like What she was doing, and now You're doing exactly the same thing, so... So what? If I were you, I'd watch myself. Is that a threat? You're over your head and out of your league. Remember Reagan. Ugh! Hey. Oh, yeah, I'm out of ribbon. She was so rude though. [instrumental music] Hi. Oh, ms. Humphries. I have your stuff. I'm so sorry for the delay. I picked up your phone from corporate last night. They had to do a deep dive data retrieval Which can take some time. I understand. Were they able to get it working? Yes and no. Good news is, they were able to get the phone working And the hardware is fully functional. The bad news is most of the files were not salvageable. What do you mean? Typically with damage of This sort, recovery is unlikely. This is literally a matter of life and death. My daughter is missing, there might be something In this phone that saves her life. Please, is there anything you can do? Please. Anything. There may be one thing I can try. Give me a couple hours and let me see what I can do, okay? Thank you. Of course. - I'm on my way to school now. - Okay, I'll see you there. Lina, you're not supposed to be in here. Samantha threatened me. Ah, give me a minute. What? She told me that if I didn't stay out of her business I'd disappear just like Reagan did. - She said that? - Dad! It's her. It's definitely her. She did something to Reagan. And I think Mona is in on it too. Lower your voice. Honey, those are some serious allegations. Well, this is a serious situation. I know. Okay, um, I'll pick up with this later, okay? Come on. Just had to squeal to daddy, huh? - Shut up. - What? Like I'm gonna get expelled for hurting your feelings? No, but hopefully you'll get arrested For whatever you did to Reagan. - You're crazy. - And you can't stand not... Ladies! That's enough. Hey, what'd they say? Is everything okay? What's your problem? Lina, is everything okay? Yeah, just waiting on my dad. He's in the principal's office. You. Mrs. Humphries, can I help you? Yeah, I need the combination to Reagan's locker? May I ask what for? I'm here to collect her belongings. Is that a problem? The police informed us that it was to be sealed Until further notice. What? Hey, Beth, what are you doing here? I'm here to get the combination for Reagan's locker But apparently I can't Because the police have sealed it. The police requested that it remain sealed Until they can examine it. - I'm her mother. - Okay. I'll take care of it, alright? Thank you, Carla. And you two can go back to class And I'll take your phones till the end of the day. [indistinct] Or unless you wanna be suspended. Thanks, a lot, dad. What is going on here, kyle? We need to talk. [bell ringing] Yeah, we need to talk. So apparently, Samantha threatened Lina. Threatened? - This is crazy! - Unheard of. Kyle, honestly, do you think Samantha Has something to do with this? I don't know, without evidence It's irrelevant either way. I need to get into that locker, kyle. She might have a journal in there. Okay, well, I'll see what I can do. Kyle, I'm not waiting for the police. Okay, just give me a little while, I can pull her file With the combo when they're gone for the day, okay? Here. - Thank you. - Everything's gonna be fine. Okay, I'd meet me back here at 6 o'clock I'll leave the side door open near my office, okay? - Okay. Yup. - 6 o'clock, side door, okay? Yup, okay. [instrumental music] (Mona) hello. (Samantha) hey. - Hey. - Where have you been? I just skipped fourth period. Wait, were you with your secret boyfriend? What do you want? I swear if you say one more demeaning thing, I'm done. - I'm never demeaning to you. - Oh, really? My non-existent life. Oh, come on, seriously? Is it that hard for you to apologize? Fine, I'm sorry, okay? But this is an emergency. I need to post something, like right now. I'm done helping you. Come on, Mona. I need your phone. Please? Look... I know I can be a jerk sometimes, okay? But I need you. Thank you. I just need to record something. - How do I look? - Fine. Hey, everyone! Just checking in. Still waiting on the results from the challenge. Keep sharing, keep wearing those ribbons for Reagan. On the positive, this tragedy may have sparked a romance Between a certain single mother, and our 'ever so popular chem teacher.' So remember, with every negative there's always a positive! Keep your heads up. Subscribe and share! How'd I sound? Like kinda somber, but uplifting? 'what?' Nothing. I know you're lying. What's up? [phone ringing] "boo" wants to know if you're still on for tonight? Sam, Sam... Time for me to find out who this Secret guy is, what do ya think? - Hello. - Sam, Sam.. Hey, hey, I'm sorry. Yeah, I.. No, I know. I'll call you back. Okay. What are you doing, Mona? I mean, this is completely insane! Sam, I've done everything for you my entire life. So please don't tell anyone. - No, but he's... - a what? Sees me for me? Doesn't think I'm your Samantha's second? I know what you say behind my back. This is wrong, Mona. You have to end it! See, this is why I don't share anything with you. You don't know what I'm doing through. And all this stuff with Reagan... Wait. What stuff with Reagan? - Nothing. - What do you know, Mona? Oh, my god, I'm getting blamed And it's been you this whole time! No, I'm telling the cops. - Sam, no... - let go off me. [Samantha screaming] [thudding] [instrumental music] Sam? Sam? [instrumental music] [phone ringing] Hey, Beth, it's Lina. Hey, Lina, what's up? You got anything? Well, today, at school, I saw Mona wearing a black bracelet Just like the one Reagan described. 'and I just pulled up a couple of pictures' 'they all have them.' Mona, Chaz, and Samantha. They're identical. It's Samantha. I know it is. She's the only one to gain from this. Beth, Samantha's in the hospital. She's in the hospital? What? I don't know. I'm heading over there right now. 'I'll meet you at your place afterwards.' Alright. Thanks. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [grunts] [thudding] [intense music] [screams] [thud] [grunting] [music continues] [groans] (kyle) Beth. 'Beth, wake up.' 'Beth, wake up.' 'Beth. Beth wake up.' Hey, Beth, wake up. - Hey. - What happened? I was late, you didn't leave the door open. I had to call Carla to get a new set of keys. We heard screaming. Are you okay? What happened? Reagan's locker. Somebody already went through it. It wasn't you? No, it was me. I-I think I found something that... Okay, we need to get you to the hospital, okay? Carla, will you help her, please? I'm gonna call the police. Alright, there's been an attack at the high school. It's gone! Her notebook is gone. What is it? Someone must've known that We're gonna be here tonight. Ah, I need an ambulance please. We really need to get you to a doctor. No! I'm not going. Wait, Beth-Beth, what are you doing? Where are you going? I need to get to Reagan's phone. No, Beth. Honestly, wait, you can't. Beth, wait. Beth. [instrumental music] Beth. [engine revving] Oh my god, you scared me. I heard a car. I thought you were Beth. I was here looking for Reagan. Is Beth here? Is she home? No, I can't get a hold of her. She's not answering her calls. - I need to talk to her. No. - Are you okay? I was just at the hospital, and Samantha Told me something about my dad. And I have to find him, and he's not home. I need to talk to Beth. Okay, alright, come in, come on. Hello? Hello? Hi. Sorry, I'm late. Did you find anything? Not as much as I hoped. But I was able to get something. Thank you. [instrumental music] Hey, Robby. Robby. I told the police everything. I don't know what to tell you. So you said that you saw Samantha and her friend, right? - Mona. - And Reagan wasn't here. It was just the two of them? - I... - Robby, please. Please. My daughter means everything to me. And she went missing here last night. I'm asking you as a mother. Help me. Samantha's friend, Mona, she came back last night. - She was with this guy? - Who? What guy? - I don't know, he just... - he just what? He threatened me. He told me if I said anything To the police, he would hurt me. That's all I know. Detective barrows, it's Beth. Mona's involved. Mona, and someone else, a man. Call me when you get a chance. Please call me immediately. It's an emergency. Beth. Oh, my god, kyle! You had me so worried. What the heck is going on? It's-it's Mona. She's involved. I talked to the guy at the fro-yo shop, and he was... Relax, take a breath, okay? Breathe, breathe. I grabbed Reagan's phone. There's something on it. Look. It's not very clear, but it seems like Mona might be involved. [groans] Shh! [instrumental music] So, it dawned on me that there would be A location on Reagan's phone. Alright, so this is not my forte, but I know that Beth's tablet is connected to her phone, and Reagan's phone. I just can't figure out how to get in. It's "tofu." - Tofu? - The password. Because Beth loved it, and Reagan hated it. It was a thing with them. Okay, I'm in. Do you know what we're looking for? Anything she may have posted before she went missing. This is new. Hey, guys, this is it. I know you're expecting dirt But this is a different kind of tea. It's about truth. Eight years ago, my dad, Andrew humphries and I were In a horrible car accident. He was the greatest dad ever, And that was the day that I lost him. The doctor said that I would probably never walk again. But my physical therapist and my mom Had a different plan. I hurt so badly. And I wanted to give up every single day. But my mom, Beth humphries, wouldn't let me. So she contacted happy feet alliance, 'cause she knew that I was gonna need help fighting this. And they introduced me to dance. And I fell in love. And then I learned how to stand, and then walk, and then fly. So, no matter what happens with this challenge I just wanted to let everyone know my "why" And about the angels at happy feet. They saved me. Them and my mom. So, this is one's for you, mom And for all the kids who wanna learn to fly. [instrumental music] What are you doing? I'm posting it. - This needs to be seen. - Yeah. [instrumental music] Mom! Mom! 'mom, mom, mom!' Mom! 'mom!' [crying] oh, my baby! Mom. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry! - Are you okay? - It's okay! Honestly, are you hurt, baby? No, no, I didn't get hurt. You tell me. You can tell me. - You promise me. - I promise. I promise, I'm okay! - I love you. - I love you too. [indistinct] You're Samantha's friend. Mona. I have a name. Mona, right. Where are we, Mona? Under the bleachers, before they kept funding This is where shop class was. And why are you doing this? Where's kyle? Everything would have been fine if you just deleted that video. It was destroyed with my phone! No one saw it! What video? The last challenge video. The one we recorded at Lina's, she thinks 'somehow we recorded her.' Recorded her doing what? Your daughter caught me coming out of kyle's room. Okay, and what were you doing in kyle's room, sweetie? We've been seeing each other for awhile now. And no one was supposed to know, and then you ruined everything! Kyle is an adult, you're-you're teenager. We're in love. No, you're too young to be Involved in something like this. This, this is kidnapping. I didn't mean that to go this far. I-it was supposed to be simple. I just wanted to be with him And then people kept getting hurt, and it... Shh! Honey, it's okay. It's not your fault, okay, sweetie? It's okay. Just help us get out of here. And we're gonna help you. Okay? 'please.' It's him. Give me the key. Please-please, we have to let them go. - We can't-we can't get in that. - Look, hey, look. - It's too late for that, okay? - It's not. What do you think, the police are just gonna Look the other way? I don't-I don't know. Let's not forget, it was you who pushed Samantha. - You know that was an accident. - No, no. It doesn't-it doesn't matter. Listen. You wanna be with me, right? Yes, I do, I do. Let me handle this, okay? 'everything's gonna be fine.' I need your face, please. [dramatic music] Go. It's recording. It's-it's recording. - Get out. - 'okay, okay.' Hey, dad. - Hey. - Can I have that? Yeah, yeah, here's your phone. I was gonna do a little dance myself. [laughs] Had you deleted this in the first place Would have made things lot easier. What, I didn't know. I never saw it. Oh, you didn't? Then what was this big reveal you were talking about? There wasn't anything. That was something completely different... Now, you weren't planning on ruining my reputation? Destroying my life with my daughter? - No. I swear! Why would I... - no, no? No? Kyle, that is enough. Beth, I did not wanted to come to this, okay? But I will not lose my daughter. And you're gonna take mine away from me, instead? She was in the wrong place at the wrong time, okay? I-I tried to fix it. I told her exactly what to do. (Reagan) 'I'm not doing this.' 'oh, I know what you're doing' 'and it's not gonna work.' So you're thief and a liar now. - You're insane. - Yes, let me see it. - Just let me look at it. - 'stop, god.' And then again in the parking lot. Check that out. She was nervous about you walking home now. Yeah, I know she is, but... Hey, you. [sighs] Need a lift? - Gettin' home? - Yes, thank you so much. [groans] Well, they're just kids, they're teenagers. You can't do this. - You're being crazy! - Oh, I'm being crazy? - Yeah, you're being crazy. - I'm crazy. I'm crazy for trying to save my life with my daughter. No, crazy would be doing nothing. Please don't. Don't do it. Please, kyle. When I saw that you opened the locker I had to do something, right? All for a journal with nothing in it, which forced me To call Carla for an alibi. [groans] Come on! Come on! Come on! Come. Come. [intense music] [clanging] Go, go, go, go, go! Yeah, I'm okay. Kyle. [music continues] Now what? Alright. Come. [panting] Honestly, Beth, there's no good end to this. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. [groans] No! No! [screams] Reagan, Reagan, drop the gun. Don't do it, baby! Don't! Do not make me hurt her. Mom! Kyle. [groans] [gunshot] - Kyle. - Baby, let's go! What? Kyle. [instrumental music] Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Shh, it's gonna be okay. What do you think they're gonna do to her? It's hard to say. (Beth) 'she did help out in the end, some..'
