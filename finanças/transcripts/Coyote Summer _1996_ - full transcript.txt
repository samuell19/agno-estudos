SNAP, YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE? IT WAS THAT KID. HORSE WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM. SNAPPER, YOU ALL RIGHT? HE WAS SETTLING DOWN. YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT ANIMAL. YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS KIA CAN BE. HE'S OFF LIMITS TO EVERYONE, EXCEPT SNAPPER. YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH. COME ON, NOW. GET THAT HORSE PUT UP. GIVE ME A HAND WITH SNAPPER HERE. [ Mitchell: ] I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WRONG WITH KIA-- SUCH GOOD BREEDING. [ Snapper: ] IT JUST DOESN'T FIGURE. THAT HORSE IS MAKING ZERO PROGRESS, MITCHELL. HE'S A LOST CAUSE. HOW BAD HE HURT YA? A FEW BRUISED RIBS, MAYBE TWO BROKE. THAT HORSE COULD KICK YA INTO NEXT WEEK. THE VET THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS, BUT THE TEST CAME UP NEGATIVE. I THINK WE GOTTA SERIOUSLY CONSIDER PUTTING HIM DOWN. WELL, I'M NOT READY TO TAKE THAT STEP JUST YET. FACE IT, MITCHELL. OUR BREEDIN' EXPERIMENT DIDN'T WORK. WE PROBABLY CROSSED LINES TOO CLOSE--GOT A MUTANT OFFSPRING. WE GOT A LOT OF MONEY INVESTED IN THAT HORSE. MITCHELL... CONTINUE TRAINING HIM. THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT YOU HERE. [ Clears throat ] YEAH, THEY'RE JUST BEAUTIFUL, AREN'T THEY? I WANT TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU, CALLIE. WHEN YOUR AUNT MAGGIE INVITED YOU HERE, I WASN'T SURE WHAT WE WERE GETTING INTO. I SURE DIDN'T ASK TO COME. WELL, I KNOW. BUT YOU'RE HERE AND THAT'S A PLAIN FACT. BUT, WELL, JUST SO THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS, I THINK WE SHOULD GET THINGS CLEAR BETWEEN US, YOU KNOW, RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. YEAH, LIKE WHAT? WELL, EVERYONE PULLS HIS WEIGHT AROUND HERE. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK ON A RANCH, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE SOME TO YOU. I'VE ASKED RAFE TO TEACH YOU TO RIDE, DO SOME CHORES... MEET HIM IN THE HORSE BARN IN THE MORNING. HE'LL BE WAITING. RAFE... THE GUY WHO TRIED TO CALM THE HORSE? THAT'S HIM. WHAT'S WITH THAT BLACK HORSE? OH, THAT'S A LONG STORY. WHAT TOOK YA SO LONG? DANGEROUS FOR ME TO BE AWAY. SOMEONE AT THE RANCH MIGHT NOTICE. THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. MR. WELLS WANTS TO KNOW WHEN HE CAN TAKE DELIVERY OF HIS HORSE? SOON. FOSTER'S NOT READY TO GIVE UP, YET. THEN STEAL IT. WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY? YOU CAN'T DO THAT. IT'S TOO EASY TO TRACE. WELLS HAS TO BE PATIENT AND FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL PLAN. MR. WELLS IS NOT A PATIENT MAN. SO, WHAT IS YOUR STORY? HI, YOU MUST BE CALLIE. MITCHELL SAID YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TEACH ME SOMETHING. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. LESSON ONE IS WHAT COWBOYS CALL JUICIN' THE COW. JUICIN' THE COW? HERE, PUT THIS ON. I NEED A HAT TO MILK A COW? TRUST ME. IT KEEPS THE COW'S HAIR OR WHATEVER FROM GETTING IN YOUR HAIR. GROSS. NOW, GRAB THE BUCKET IN YOUR RIGHT HAND AND STOOL IN YOUR LEFT AND COME HERE. WHAT'S HER NAME, ANYWAY? CALLIE, MEET BOSSY. [ Moos ] PUT YOUR FOOT HERE IN THE STIRRUP, AND THEN... GOT IT? NOW, YOU TRY. UHH. THERE'S A REASON NOT TO WEAR THOSE KIND OF SHOES. HERE, LET ME HELP YOU. [ Grunts ] [ Man: ] MR. WELLS IS CONCERNED YOU MIGHT BE TRYING TO DELIVER DAMAGED MERCHANDISE. [ Snapper: ] THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE HORSE. A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY WENT INTO SELECTING A MARE AND SIRE, BOTH WERE STRONG BAR D AND SWING RANCH BLOODLINES. WITH THAT BLOODLINE, HE'S POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE FINEST STUDS IN THE COUNTRY. AS LONG AS YOU CAN DELIVER. I KNOW A HUSTLE WHEN I SEE ONE. I MEAN, ON THE ONE HAND, HE'S TELLING THIS GUY THAT KIA'S A GREAT HORSE, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S TRYING TO CONVINCE MITCHELL TO DESTROY HIM. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING ABOUT THAT HORSE. I COULD SETTLE HIM DOWN IF SNAPPER'D GIVE ME A CHANCE. RAFE, THIS IS SERIOUS. SOMETHING'S GOING ON AND IT'S NOT RIGHT. THANKS. LET'S GET BACK TO WORK. I FEEL LIKE A PRISONER ON A CHAIN GANG. YOU LOOK LIKE ONE, TOO. EASY, KIA. WHOA, BOY. YOU GONNA SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS? STEADY, BOY. THAT OUGHTA DO IT. [ Laughs ] THAT REALLY OUGHTA DO IT. [ Laughs ] GET WILD, BOY, GET WILD! [ Laughs ] [ Neighing ] I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS. IT'S NOT WORTH IT, MITCHELL. HE SHOULD BE PUT DOWN. BEFORE YOU DO THAT, MITCHELL, LISTEN TO WHAT CALLIE HAS TO SAY. LAST NIGHT, HE GAVE KIA A SHOT THAT MADE HIM WILD. WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT, SNAPPER? JUST DOING WHAT THE VET TOLD ME TO DO. I GIVE HIM VALIUM EVERY NIGHT. TO KEEP HIM UNDER CONTROL. HOW COME HE GOT SO CRAZY, THEN? VALIUM HADN'T TAKEN EFFECT, I GUESS. MAGGIE, SNAPPER KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. YOU GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS OF YOUR OWN WITHOUT GETTING INVOLVED WITH SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. YOU OWE SNAPPER, HERE, AN APOLOGY. CALLIE... [ Sighs ] SORRY, SNAPPER. AHHH, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. KIDS ARE LIKE THAT. NOW THE REAL QUESTION... WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THE HORSE? I GUESS THERE'S NO REAL CHOICE, IS THERE? SURE DON'T WANT HIM TO HURT SOMEBODY ELSE. OF COURSE NOT. MITCHELL, YOU BRED THAT HORSE TO BE A CHAMPION. DON'T GIVE UP ON HIM. LOOK AT HIM. MAGGIE, I GOT A FORTUNE SUNK IN THAT HORSE. YOU THINK I WANT TO SEE THAT ALL GO DOWN THE DRAIN? CALL THE VET. MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS. [ Snorts ] HMMM... COME ON. OH, COME ON. HERE YOU GO. COME ON. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. GOOD BOY. YOU'RE STILL TEACHING ME HOW TO DO STUFF, RIGHT? RIGHT. WELL, THIS IS THE MORNING FEED. THAT'S ALL THEY GET. THEY'LL EAT THE WHOLE BARREL IF YOU LET THEM. SO? THE OATS LIE IN THEIR STOMACH, THEY CAN GET COLIC, AND THEY CAN DIE. BUMMER. SO, HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF A PLAN YET? A PLAN? YEAH, A PLAN. TO SAVE KIA. TO SAVE KIA? IS THERE AN ECHO OUT HERE? AN ECHO? SNAPPER HAS CONVINCED MITCHELL TO PUT KIA DOWN. WHEN? I DON'T KNOW. HE WENT OFF TO CALL THE VET. SO HOW ABOUT THIS... WE STEAL KIA. NOT PERMANENTLY OR ANYTHING. JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE. AND WE TRAIN HIM. YOU DO KNOW HOW TO TRAIN A HORSE, DON'T YOU? YOU'RE NUTS. AND WHAT IS THIS "WE" BUSINESS? I DON'T NEED SOME CITY GIRL TELLING ME TO RISK MY JOB TO STEAL MY BOSS'S STUD. THE ONLY THING I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS WHERE TO HIDE HIM. BUT I'M SURE WITH ALL THE YEARS YOU'VE LIVED HERE, YOU KNOW OF A PLACE. COME ON, RAFE, HELP ME. I COULD GET IN TROUBLE. I NEED THIS JOB, CALLIE. BUT IT'LL WORK. WE CAN MAKE IT WORK. YOU AND ME TOGETHER. I JUST CAN'T. WELL, I CAN AND I'M NOT LETTING HIM KILL THAT HORSE. WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND THAT HORSE? SNAPPER'S A SNAKE AND I DON'T TRUST HIM. SNAPPER IS ONE OF THE BEST TRAINERS IN THE COUNTRY. WHO WAS THAT CREEPY GUY I SAW HIM WITH? SNAPPER LIKES TO GAMBLE. IT WAS PROBABLY SOMEONE FROM THE TRACK. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP ME, I'LL DO IT MYSELF. LOOK, YOU'LL HAVE THE HORSE SOON ENOUGH. HANG ON. YOU WATER THE FOALS YET? UH-HUH. GOOD. TAKE OFF, THEN. I GOT THINGS TO DO. I'M BACK. DON'T WORRY. LIKE I SAID, I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. YOU'LL HAVE YOUR HORSE SOON ENOUGH. [ Tapping ] OK, YOU WIN. I KNOW A PLACE. MEET ME BEHIND THE STABLES AT DAWN. IT WILL TAKE US AWHILE TO RIDE UP THERE. RIDE? WAIT... ME? DAWN? HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT? DID YOU HAVE TO BRING THIS STUPID BACKPACK? WOW! HERE WE ARE. MY FATHER BROUGHT ME HERE WHEN I WAS LITTLE. HE TOLD ME THE ANCIENT ONES LIVED HERE. LATER, THE SHOSHONE USED IT FOR SECRET MEETINGS. THEY WERE COMPLETELY HIDDEN, BUT COULD SEE ENEMIES APPROACHING FROM THE LOOKOUT POINT. DO YOU EVER COME HERE ANYMORE? ONCE IN AWHILE, YES. WHEN I NEED TO BE ALONE. DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT IT? NOBODY AT THE RANCH, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. WE CAN KEEP KIA HERE TIL HE'S TRAINED... IF HE CAN BE TRAINED. YAH, YAH! GET UP THERE. YAH! COME ON THERE. COME ON. YAH, YAH! YEAH, THAT'S IT. YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD, RACHEL. THANKS, MAX. YAH, YAH! [ Neighs ] YAH! [ Clanking ] DARN IT! HUNGRY? I'M GOING ON A PICNIC. WITH? MYSELF.

WELLS' PEOPLE VISITED ME THIS AFTERNOON. THEY'RE TIRED OF WAITING. THEY WANT THAT HORSE, TONIGHT. THAT OUGHT TO WORK OUT JUST PERFECT. FOSTER'S FINALLY DECIDED TO DESTROY HIM. GLAD TO HEAR YOU FINALLY GOT YOUR ACT TOGETHER. YOU BRING THE DOPE? BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. IT'S NOT VALIUM. YOU GIVE MORE THAN 100 CCs, YOU REALLY WILL HAVE A DEAD HORSE ON YOUR HANDS. EASY, BOY. EASY, BOY. HURRY UP! I'M TRYING. LET ME TRY. NO, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW. COME ON. EASY, KIA. YOU'RE NOT DOING SO GREAT YOURSELF. HERE, BOY. HERE. THINK NOBODY EVER HEARD OF CARROTS BEFORE YOU GOT HERE?

IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THEY'LL START LOOKING. YOU'RE JEALOUS. NOPE, JUST WORRIED. DID THEY FIND HIM? NOT A TRACE. MOST OF THE MEN HAVE BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT. WELL, I HOPE HE'S NOT HURT. MAYBE WE SHOULD OFFER A REWARD. OH, YOU LOOK GREAT. LOOK AT HER, MITCHELL. DOESN'T SHE LOOK GOOD? GREAT. WOW. EVERYTHING OK, CALLIE? SURE, WHY? HEY, WAIT UP. WHERE YOU GOIN'? TO MEET RAFE.

[ Mumbling ] WHAT? I SAID, "THIS CRAZY HORSE HAS THE SPIRIT OF A COYOTE." WHY A COYOTE? THE SHOSHONE REVERE THE COYOTE. LEGEND SAYS THAT HE IS A TRICKSTER WHO TESTS OUR PATIENCE IN LIFE. HIS PRESENCE IS ALWAYS A SIGN. YEAH, WELL, WHY IS IT ALWAYS A "HE"? AREN'T THERE ANY FEMALE COYOTES? THERE ARE. WHO'S THAT? THAT'S MY GRANDFATHER. HE'S CALLED MOPEAH. ARE WE IN TROUBLE? NOT WITH HIM. LEAVE THE LIGHT. MR. WELLS IS VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING. WHAT'S THE HURRY ALL OF A SUDDEN? MR. WELLS NEEDS TIME TO GET THE HORSE TO THE BUYER IN MIAMI. HE'S SCHEDULED TO LEAVE FOR SOUTH AMERICA NEXT WEEK. IF HE HAS TO RETURN TO ARGENTINA EMPTY-HANDED, THE DEAL'S OFF. YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK OUT YOUR DEBTS TO MR. WELLS SOME OTHER WAY. ONE WEEK... IT'S IMPOSSIBLE! YOU'D BETTER MAKE IT POSSIBLE. CALLIE... OH,...HI. HI. HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF YOU THIS WEEK. OH, I KNOW. RAFE'S BEEN SHOWING ME AROUND. IN THE FUTURE, WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU ARE? I MEAN, YOUR MOTHER CALLED YESTERDAY, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE AGAIN. SHE'LL GET OVER IT. CALL HER TONIGHT, OK? I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK. BUT I'M... NO BUTS. I HOPE THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT I, I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT... WELL, WHAT YOU AND RAFE ARE UP TO. I MEAN, MITCHELL AND I... WE'VE KIND OF FIGURED IT OUT, AND WE... OH, AUNT MAGGIE, PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY. WE WERE JUST TRYING TO KEEP... I KNOW. I WAS YOUR AGE ONCE. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FALL IN LOVE. I DO. OH..., YEAH... WELL, YEAH, WE JUST... I DON'T KNOW. HE'S JUST THE COOLEST GUY AND CUTE... SO CUTE. WHICH IS WONDERFUL. I MEAN, COOL AND CUTE AND... WE'RE JUST FRIENDS. GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU HAVE A FRIEND. YOU SEEM SO MUCH HAPPIER. YOUR MOTHER WAS VERY WORRIED. WE ALL WERE. THE ONLY KIDS MY MOTHER IS WORRIED ABOUT ARE IN LONDON. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO HARD ON HER, CALLIE. IT'S BEEN VERY TOUGH FOR HER TO RAISE YOU AND EARN A LIVING ALL BY HERSELF. YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW. IT HAPPENS. YES, IT DOES. LOOK AT RAFE. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS MOTHER. HOW COME? SHE DIED GIVING BIRTH TO HIM. SO... YOU SEE, YOU'RE NOT ALONE. PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND, MAYBE MORE THAN YOU THINK. LET'S GO. HEY, RAFE. HI. OK, HAVE FUN. KEEP AN EYE ON THIS ONE. AHH, HE WILL. ISN'T THERE AN EASIER WAY OF GETTING THERE? YEAH, IT'S HALF THE DISTANCE UP THE BACKSIDE OF BALDY MOUNTAIN. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE IT RIDING DOUBLE. IT'S STEEP AND DANGEROUS AND NOT FOR BEGINNERS. OHH, I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE. WHAT'S IN HERE, ANYWAY? HEY, THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. YOU NEED TO CARRY THIS EVERYWHERE YOU GO? STICKS AND A STUPID OLD KNIFE. SHHH. WHAT? NOTHING, I GUESS. WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED. I DON'T SEE ANYONE. YOU WERE RIGHT. SNAPPER KNOWS. ARE YOU SURE? ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. SEE, IT'S NOTHING. YOU JUST HAVE A GUILTY CONSCIENCE. SHHH! SEE? WHAT DID I TELL YA? [ Neighs ] WHOA...UHH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU CRAZY? DON'T YOU KNOW YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE? HE'S STILL DOWN. COME ON. LET'S GO. WHERE? TO GET HIM, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M SORRY, OK? I JUST WANTED TO... KIA AND... I WASN'T THINKING. IT DIDN'T HIT HIM, DID IT? WHAT IF HE'S DEAD? WHERE IS HE? CHARLIE'S RIGHT HERE, SNAPPER, HE DIDN'T RUN OFF. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IS HE ALL RIGHT? A LITTLE DELIRIOUS. SNAPPER, YOU HIT YOUR HEAD. COME ON, WE'LL HELP YOU HOME. HERE, TAKE A DRINK. WELL, I GUESS IT'S A GOOD THING FOR SNAPPER THEY SHOWED UP WHEN THEY DID. IT WILL COST HIM THREE DAYS' WORK, AND HE STILL HASN'T FOUND KIA. MAY I BE EXCUSED? SURE, HONEY. [ Sighs ] YOU KNOW, OUR PLAN'S NOT GOING TO WORK, DON'T YOU? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SO WHAT IF KIA COMES BACK TAME. THAT WILL KEEP HIM ALIVE, BUT IT WON'T DO WHAT HE WAS BRED TO DO. I'M NOT GETTING YOUR DRIFT. LOOK, FOSTER WANTED A CHAMPION. THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM VALUABLE. WE CAN PROVE THAT HE'S NOT CRAZY OR SICK OR WHATEVER. WHAT WE CAN'T PROVE IS THAT HE'S GOOD, REALLY GOOD. ONLY HE CAN DO THAT. HORSES FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY COMPETE. IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR BREEDERS AND TRAINERS. OH, YOU MEAN WE CAN ENTER KIA? NOT IN A SHOW EVENT. IN THE BIG RACE-- THE CROWN INVITATIONAL. AND IF KIA WINS THE BIG RACE... AND IF I TRAINED HIM... OHHH, KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE. PROVE KIA A CHAMPION... AND YOU AS HIS TRAINER. I WORKED SO HARD FOR A CHANCE LIKE THIS. SO, HOW DO WE GET HIM IN THE RACE? THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. HE'S ALREADY REGISTERED IN ALL EVENTS. HAS BEEN SINCE HE WAS BORN. THE BAD NEWS-- KIA BARELY LETS US SADDLE HIM. HE'S NOT READY FOR ANY RACE-- ESPECIALLY NOT THE CROWN INVITATIONAL. EVEN IF HE WAS, I'M TOO BIG TO BE A JOCKEY. WELL, I COULD DO IT, COULDN'T I? YOU? YEAH, WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE? WHAT THE HECK? IT'S WORTH A TRY. RAFE, YOU'VE BEEN NEGLECTING THAT NEW HORSE YOU WERE BREAKING. YOU'D BEST BE GETTING TO IT TODAY. I WAS HOPING TO TAKE CALLIE OUT RIDING ALONG THE RED CLIFFS. I THINK MAYBE YOU TWO GOT A LITTLE MORE GOING ON THAN RIDING LESSONS. HUH? RAFE, YOU BETTER GET TO THAT GELDING. HE DEFINITELY KNOWS. WE'VE GOT TO GET KIA OUT OF THERE. KIA! MAYBE HE JUST GOT OUT. WE'LL START SEARCHING THE AREA. I'M TELLLING YOU, I LOOKED AND HE'S NOT THERE. AND THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT BY HIMSELF. WHAT IF SNAPPER FOUND HIM? MEET ME BEHIND THE STABLES WHEN I'M DONE HERE. [ Thunder ] WE HAVE TO PACK IT IN. IT'S GETTING LATE. CAN WE START FIRST THING IN THE MORNING? YEAH. HONEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I STARTED TO WORRY. WELL, WE WERE OUT ALONG THE RED CLIFFS AND IT GOT DARK. I'M SORRY. I SAVED DINNER FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M REALLY TIRED. THANKS ANYWAY. SORRY I'M LATE. THE ALARM DIDN'T GO OFF. WE'VE GOT TO FINISH MILKING BEFORE WE GO. WOW! YOU MUST HAVE BEEN UP REALLY EARLY. I WANT TO START LOOKING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOU TWO LOSE SOMETHING? LIKE A HALF-WILD HORSE, MAYBE? YOU STEAL HIM? WHERE IS HE? I SAVED KIA'S LIFE. TWO DAYS AGO WHEN I SAW YOU TWO LEAVE I DECIDED TO SEE WHERE YOU WERE GOING. SO I FOLLOWED YOU TO YOUR HIDING PLACE AND I SAW YOUR GUEST. YOU WHAT? WHAT IS HER PROBLEM? LET HER TALK. GO ON, RACHEL. THEN YESTERDAY WHEN CALLIE LEFT BY HERSELF, I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP. I THOUGHT I COULD SHORT-CUT IT BY CROSSING BALDY. ON THE RIDGE WAITING, I SAW SNAPPER FOLLOWING YOUR OLD TRAIL TOWARDS KIA'S HIDING PLACE. I RAN DOWN AND I GOT HIM OUT BEFORE SNAPPER COULD GET THERE. SO WHERE IS HE NOW? HE'S AT MY BROTHER'S RANCH. OH, YES! THANK YOU, RACHEL. I'M SORRY WE JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS. YOU MEAN, YOU'RE SORRY SHE DID. WAIT, THAT'S NOT... SHOE POLISH AND A HAIRCUT. DIDN'T WANT ANYONE RECOGNIZING KIA WHEN HE'S GOT A PRICE ON HIS HEAD. SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WE? IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF ME THAT HE'S HERE. SHE'S RIGHT, CALLIE. WE'RE ENTERING KIA IN THE CROWN INVITATIONAL. REALLY? WHO'S RIDING? YOU'RE JOKING? WELL, I'M NOT SURE YET. SHE'S DOING OK, BUT SHE HASN'T HAD MUCH TIME. WHY NOT LET ME DO IT? REALLY? YEAH. THAT WOULD BE... RACHEL'S A GOOD RIDER, CALLIE. IF SHE'S ON KIA, WE MIGHT HAVE A REAL SHOT. YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR. IT WAS MY IDEA. I WAS THE ONE WHO... IS THIS ABOUT YOUR RIDING KIA OR WINNING THE RACE? OK, WHATEVER. KIA WILL NEED AS MUCH RIDING TIME AS HE CAN GET IN TRAINING FOR THE RACE. AND I CAN STILL TEACH YOU. EASY NOW. EASY BOY. EASY, BOY. EASY, KIA. EASY. WHOA. EASY. COME ON. HOLD IT, RAFE. WHOA, KIA! WHOA! DA! THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. WHOA. EASY. COME ON, KIA. WHOA. EASY, KIA. WORK WITH ME, KIA. COME ON. EASY. LOOKING GOOD. EASY, BOY.

YOU GOT HIM. WHOA. YEAH. WHOA! ALL RIGHT. WHEW. WHY IS HE DOING THAT? HE'S A CUTTING HORSE. IT'S PART OF HIS BREEDING. ONLY THIS SILLY HORSE THINKS HE'S A BARREL RACER. A WHAT? IT'S A COMPETITION WHEN A HORSE RACES AGAINST THE CLOCK AROUND BARRELS SET IN THE GROUND. SOUNDS LIKE FUN. TO YOU, MAYBE. JUST FOR FUN, TRY RUNNING KIA UP AND AROUND THE BARREL. HAH! HAH! COME ON, BOY. COME ON. HAH! YAH! WHOA. GOOD BOY. GOOD BOY. WHAT DO YOU THINK, BOY? YOU READY FOR A REAL RIDE? THAT'S VERY GOOD, CALLIE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SUCH A GOOD ARTIST. THANKS. THAT'S A GREAT LIKENESS. I'M SURPRISED YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. YEAH. UMM, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS. YOUR MOM CALLED THIS MORNING AND SHE FINISHED HER RESEARCH PROJECT EARLY AND SHE'S GOING TO BE COMING HERE TO SPEND SOME TIME BEFORE THE TWO OF YOU GO HOME TOGETHER. WE'RE NOT LEAVING BEFORE NEXT WEEKEND, ARE WE? NO, WHY? IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT GOING ON? OH, NEXT WEEKEND. THAT'S THE CROWN INVITATIONAL. IS THAT IT? OH, RIGHT. WELL, MITCHELL AND I ARE SPONSORS. KIA WAS GOING TO RUN IN THE 2-YEAR-OLD RACE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO CONFIDE IN AN ADULT. ABOUT WHAT? REMEMBER CALLIE, SNAPPER'S NOT A STUPID MAN. ANY NEWS ON KIA? I THINK MAYBE I'VE BEEN BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE BY LOOKING FOR HIM IN THE CANYON. ALL RIGHT. YAH! YAH! HEY, SORRY I'M LATE. HOW WAS HE? HE WAS GREAT. WE BEAT LAST YEAR'S WINNING TIME. COOL. OH, AND GET THIS. MY BROTHER WILL LOAN US HIS TRUCK AND HIS TRAILER. WE'RE SET THEN. OH, AND I ALREADY TOLD MY MOM I'D BE SLEEPING OVER AT RACHEL'S, SO... YOUR MOM IS HERE? YEAH, SHE JUST CAME IN THIS MORNING. NOT THAT I CARE AT ALL. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE, DO YOU? JUST WAIT TIL ONE DAY SHE'S NOT HERE. YOU WON'T LIKE IT MUCH. OH, I JUST MEANT THAT I DON'T REALLY... YOU DON'T APPRECIATE ANYTHING. RAFE, WAIT. I'M GOING TO GO GET CLEANED UP. I'M SORRY. LOOK, I KNOW ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND THAT WAS A REALLY STUPID THING FOR ME TO SAY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S OK. NO, I MEAN IT. I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST HARD SOMETIMES, AND YOU JUST THROW IT AWAY. YOU DON'T REMEMBER YOUR MOTHER, DO YOU? MY DAD TOLD ME SHE HAD MORE SPIRIT THAN ANYONE HE'D EVER KNOWN. LIKE YOUR MOTHER. HOW DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT MY MOTHER'S LIKE? SHE RAISED YOU ALONE, RIGHT? SHE MUST HAVE A STRONG SPIRIT. YEAH, WELL SHE'S GOT A ROTTEN... I GUESS, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. TRUCE? TRUCE. HEY, MOM. HEY. I'M, UH... I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE. BEFORE WHEN? I DON'T KNOW. JUST BEFORE. THANKS. COME HERE. I'M SORRY I HAD TO LEAVE YOU, CAL. BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR THE SUMMER AND NOW I'M BACK AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE, NOT WITHOUT YOU. YEAH, I KNOW. I LOVE YOU, CAL. DON'T EVER FORGET THAT, OK? OK, KIA. 12 HOURS FROM NOW YOU'LL BE ON A RACETRACK. I HOPE YOU'RE READY. I HOPE WE'RE READY. HEY, DON'T WORRY. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK. YOU'LL SEE. WE BETTER GO. WE SHOULDN'T KEEP THE BIRTHDAY BOY'S BARBECUE WAITING. I THANK YOU FOR THIS DAY AND THIS LIFE... AND FOR THIS FEAST. AND I THANK YOU, MY FAMILY, FOR HONORING ME ON THE DAY OF MY BIRTH WITH THIS TRADITIONAL FOOD INSTEAD OF HAMBURGER HELPER. [ Laughter ] OK, LET'S FEAST. SO, IS EVERYONE READY FOR A GOOD STORY. [ All together: ] YES! IT'S TRADITION THAT THE ELDERS TELL STORIES. THAT WAY THE OLD STORIES SURVIVE NEW GENERATIONS. MOPEAH ALWAYS DOES IT ON HIS BIRTHDAY. COYOTE WAS OUT HUNTING ONE DAY WHEN SNAKE APPEARED. "COYOTE," HE SAID, "DON'T GO HOME. "A MONSTER WHOSE SIZE FILLS THE VALLEY "SUCKED UP ALL THE ANIMALS WITH HIS HOT BREATH." COYOTE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE IN FEAR, SO WITH HIS BUNDLE OF STICKS AND FLINT KNIFE HE SET OFF FOR THE VALLEY. HE FOUND THE MONSTER. IT STRETCHED FROM RIDGE TO RIDGE. AND HE CALLED OUT, "HO THERE, MONSTER. "WHY ARE YOU IN MY VALLEY?" THE MONSTER THREATENED TO SWALLOW UP COYOTE ON THE SPOT, BUT COYOTE KNEW HOW TO BRAG... "YOU DON'T SCARE ME," HE SAID. "MY MAGIC IS MORE POWERFUL." THE MONSTER JUST LAUGHED AND SWALLOWED COYOTE WITH ONE HOT BREATH. WHAT DID COYOTE DO? HE LANDED IN THE MONSTER'S STOMACH WHERE ALL THE ANIMALS WERE CRYING. SO HE MADE THEM FOLLOW HIM THROUGH MANY CHAMBERS UNTIL THEY SAW THE MONSTER'S HEART SWINGING ABOVE THEM. SO COYOTE, WITH HIS STICKS AND FLINT KNIFE, LIT A FIRE. BEFORE LONG, THE MONSTER SHOUTED, "COME OUT, COYOTE. "COME OUT!" BUT COYOTE ONLY THREW ANOTHER STICK IN THE FIRE. WHEN THE CORDS THAT HELD UP THE HEART BURNED THROUGH, THE MONSTER'S HEART FELL AND HE DIED. OH, BUT WAIT. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS YET TO COME. AFTER THE ANIMALS ESCAPED THROUGH THE MONSTER'S OPEN MOUTH, THEY ALL RAN HOME. BEAR SAID, "LEAVE THE BODY HERE TO ROT." COYOTE WOULDN'T ALLOW THAT AND HE BEGAN CARVING UP THE MONSTER. THE THIGH BONE HE THREW TO CHIEF MOUNTAIN NEAR THE MONTANA GLACIERS SAYING, "THERE WOULD LIVE A LONG-LEGGED RACE." FROM THAT LAND COME THE TALL BLACKFEET. AND THE MONSTER'S FAT TOSSED TO THE BLACK HILLS. AND THERE CAME THE ROUND SIOUX TRIBE. THE WHITE RIBS THROWN TO THE MISSION MOUNTAIN RANGE IN MONTANA, HOME OF THE SQUAT FLATHEAD INDIANS. WHEN HE WAS DONE, THE MONSTER'S BODY WAS GONE. "WAIT," SAID RABBIT. "YOU'VE SAVED NOTHING FOR THIS VALLEY." BUT COYOTE SMILED AND LOOKED AT HIS PAWS. A FEW DROPS OF THE MONSTER'S BLOOD WERE LEFT ON THEM. HE SPRINKLED THE BLOOD ON THE VALLEY FLOOR. "THE TRIBE THAT GROWS HERE," HE SAID, "WILL BE THE FIERCEST IN BATTLE "AND STRONGEST IN HEART."
