In this world before the inception of language... expressions were the medium of communication. As time went by, expressions helped people bring out their feelings. Our lives are similar to the art of Bharatanatyam. Bravery Shyness Laughter Fear Mercy Surprise Disgust Anger Peace Life is a mix of NINE emotions. Don't feel shy. Ask him everything you need to know about him. Welcome! - How are you? - I am doing well. - Welcome, sir. - Please welcome. Hearty welcome! - Hey, sit with your head up. - The tea is good. Did you use packet milk instead of fresh cow milk? Why? Is it not good? - No. It does taste good. - Enough with your quirks! - Please have some. - Thanks. - You too have some. Enough with the jibber-jabber. Let the boy and girl have some privacy, so that they can get to know each other. - Let's all leave. - He's absolutely right. Dude, I've done my job as you requested. Hope I did well. Let's leave. Let us sit in the living room. Sure. Let's go. - Actually-- - I don't know how to talk to strangers. That's why we gave you guys some privacy. - Where did you study? - Obviously at the school. I studied at St. Joseph. Do you like to cook? I know how to cook. Super! I like to eat. During my school and college days, I strictly focused only on studies. I never indulged or fallen in love. I remember reading somewhere... A poetry titled, "Let's Save Love." The poetry read that the husband saves his love for his future wife. I'm very much alike. How about you? - Hmm? - How about you? - Oh, God! - So, let's spend the love together. Have you been waiting for long? No! I was caught up with some work outside.. Not an issue. Hey, the gifts are here. Shall we unwrap gifts? They're ought to be lame gifts obligated to formality. Let's not waste time by unwrapping gifts. Sit down. How do you like the house? The house? I like it. I hope my parents are good to you. Then... ...what else? Nothing much though. Are you scared of the dark? I meant... Hope you're not scared of the dark? In this house, we make home-ground spices. My husband likes his food spicy. Whereas your husband doesn't like it spicy. But both are very particular about the salt. It shouldn't be in excess. Mother-in-law, what about you? - Dear, hand me over the roasted-grams. - Okay. In our house, we either make sambhar or chutney. One or the other. Over here both are required. You husband likes Sambhar. Whereas my husband likes Chutney. The chutney has to be stone-ground. - Sister, here you go, milk. - Place it over there. I wanted to see you on the day of your wedding. But the photographers and the relatives blocked my view. Only now I could properly see you. Sister, you look very pretty. - What is the name of this beauty? - Manju! I have brought you a gift. Gift? Why? As you're married I'm giving you this gift. Here you go, milk pudding. - You take some too. - No, I had enough. I'm running late for school. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Dear, please behave. Mother-in-law might walk in on us. The school did not grant my leave. If not, we could've gone to Ooty or Kodaikannal for our honeymoon. It's okay! It doesn't matter now. 'Cause we are already on our honeymoon. Keep it down. Mother-in-law might hear you. Once the exams are over. I'll take you on a vacation. Wow, it's good! Do you how to make egg-dosa? - I do. - You have to add pepper to it... Super! Make me two egg-dosa. - Meanwhile, I'll take shower. - Sure. - Mother-in-law. - Yes dear, how was the dinner? Dinner went well. I'll quickly change my clothes. You put them down. I'll do the dishes. Don't bother, dear. I'll do the dishes. Not an issue. I'll do the dishes. You just got back from dinner. It's better you take rest. I'll take care of it. Shall I switch off the lights? If you don't mind... I feel too stuffed from the dinner. Is that all? I'll make it right. Mother-in-law, how do you want your okra? Doesn't matter. Chop them as your please. Is it for the curry or stir-fry? It's for the stir-fry. Okay. - Is this okay for you? - Yes, that's about right. Please serve. That's enough for me. That's enough. You too join them, dear. It's okay. You can join us. It's okay, I'll give mother-in-law company. Your mother has a company to eat with. How is it? Dear, sit down and eat. Dear Lord! Mom, I went for the check-up yesterday. The baby is healthy. They have asked me to take good rest. - How is son-in-law? - He's doing well. He's extremely busy with work. Mom, please come over. There's still time. I'll come over eventually. Mom, I am finding it difficult to do all the chores. Please come over. How can I just drop everything and come over? Now that sister-in-law is home, she can take care of the house. She's new to the family. She needs some time getting used to. I am sure she can handle it. In couple of days I'm booking tickets. You just come over. You never listen. You're too stubborn. - Was it sister-in-law on the phone? - Yes! - How far along is she? - She's six months pregnant now. She wants me to come over right away. You please go ahead. I'll take care of the house. It'll be very helpful if you're there with her. - Is that all mangoes we have? - Let me check. Don't overheat the oil. It'll burn the crisps. Sure, ma'am! Father-in-law, coffee! Dear, I still haven't brushed my teeth. Oh, once you've brushed your teeth, I'll re-heat the coffee. Great. Why don't you go ahead and bring me my brush. - Brush? - That's right, brush. Sure, I will get it. Why the hesitation? It's your father-in-law. If it's a trouble, I'll bring it to him. Don't bother. I'll bring it to him myself. Not an issue. I'll get it. - It's okay, I'll get it for him. - I really don't mind. I'll get it for him. You please go ahead. Go ahead. - Get me a hot dosa. This one is cold. - Sure. This is for father-in-law. Make it quick. Yes. This one is hot. - Did you stone-grind the chutney? - No I used the blender. You don't have trouble yourself with the stone-grinder. Blender suits you well. He's right. Don't trouble yourself. Enough! Do you need anything else? Dear Lord! Listen. Dear, I'm kind of sweaty. Don't bother. Come closer. I'll come home early in the evening. I'm prepping for lunch. Where's dad? - Your father is out with work. And your sister is at the college. And your brother is at the cricket coaching. Mom, how much water should I add to cook the boiled rice? - Two glasses of water for one glass of rice. - If you pressure cook it for more than 3 whistles, it'll be overcooked. Okay, mom, I'll call you back later. - Okay, dear! Sir, wife didn't make lunch for you? It seems like you'll go home for lunch. New place. She needs some time to getting used to it. Absolutely right. I was just pulling your leg. I'll wait and watch how long you're going to wait. Why didn't you cook rice on firewood? No, I pressure-cooked the rice. Dear, henceforth make sure that you cook rice on firewood. Only then it'll taste good. Okay, father-in-law. Yeah I had lunch. Unfortunately, it's not homemade. Nothing can beat your cooking. Please advice her to cook rice on the firewood. Dear, it's just for few days. Why can't you adjust with pressure-cooked rice? - I'll be back soon. Sorry dear, I'll cook lunch from tomorrow. - Nothing can beat your cooking. Sure! Hi! My chest feel congested. - What happened? - It's 'cause I had food from the hotel. Okay, I'll cook lunch from tomorrow. I hope everyone is fine with having rice for dinner? No! In our family we have chapattis for dinner. I asked 'cause we have leftovers from lunch. Don't bother. Having chapati for dinner gives you power. - It prevents from growing a paunch. - Okay. I'll go and get changed. Mom, leftovers from lunch are going to waste. On top of it, they are very picky with dinner options. - I cook for 6 people. You have to cook only for two over there. - When everyone used to have fresh food for breakfast... I always end up having leftovers. - But your family is different. - They have the habit of having freshly cooked food. - You're married into affluent family. Please adjust with them. I don't know what to say. I'll speak to you later. - Okay, dear. - Dear, is dinner ready? - Yes, it's ready! I'll be there soon. Here you go, dad. - Hi, sister, how are you? - Hey! Guess what I am holding in my hand? - What is it? - Mango. Do you like it? I like mangoes. Here you go. I brought this for you. Take it. Okay, wait. I'll give you some warm milk. Please have it. Milk? I don't like it, sister. There's already too much milk at home. Fine, you don't have to drink milk. But stay back for a while. Sister, if I get home late, mother will get angry. Moreover, I'm running late for school. - I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. - Okay, bye! Dear! Dear! Dear! Hey, are you busy? It's been ages since you called. Come on, I am not busy. How are you? - I am doing great. How are you? - I am doing well too. - I called to speak to you about an important thing. Tell me. I performing dance this Sunday 7 pm at Natyalaya. I expect you and your husband to be present there. That's great news. I'll be there for sure. I'll be really mad if you make an excuse to get out of it. - I'll be there. - Bye. Bye! - Hey! - Hey! - How is coffee? - Coffee is awesome! - Henceforth you'll be making coffee. - Okay! I am planning to make mutton biriyani. - Today? - Yeah. You don't have to cook mutton today. I am well-aware why you want to cook mutton today. This the 4th time during this week you're making mutton biriyani. I made a mistake by complimenting your cooking. But not today. Dear, don't wash clothes in the washing machine. It will ruin the clothes. At least hand-wash my clothes. Okay, father-in-law. Dear, did you call the plumber? - What plumber? - Plumber! Sorry, dear. I was caught up with work and forgot about it. I'll ask him to come in the morning and get it fixed. Come on, I'll get it fixed! I'll take care of it. - Dear! - Yeah. This Sunday is your off, right? Do you remember my close friend, Anitha? She attended our wedding too. She invited us for her dance programme this Sunday. Shall we go? - Sunday? - Yes. Phew! Sunday is the only day I get to relax. We'll catch it the next time. Moreover, Sunday is the only day I get to spend time with you. Okay. We'll catch her next performance. Okay, dear. Dear, your coffee. Listen... I got my periods. Can you get me sanitary pads. Oh, God! Aren't you aware that you're not supposed to enter the kitchen during this time? I do it all the time at my place. That's not an issue. Your family might be fine with it. But our family doesn't favor it. Thank God, I didn't drink this coffee. You don't have to do any chores. I'll get take-out for breakfast. I'll ask Selvi sister to make lunch. - Please don't touch anything. - Okay. Don't serve coffee to dad. - Understood? - Sure. - Dear... pads? - Move away. Dear... Don't forget the sanitary pads. Get me sanitary pads. - Welcome, sister. - Ma'am please sit down. As you didn't make breakfast... I thought of mopping and sweeping the places. By the time I finish cleaning this house, I would've broke my back. You're right. In that case I'm lucky. My house has one small room and a kitchen. - Let me help you. - Oh, no, please don't touch. - I'll do it myself. - Come on, let me help you. Ma'am you're on periods. Don't trouble yourself. Come on, sister not you too. You do have a point. I don't how long people will cling on to age old traditions. During my mother's time, they were not allowed inside the house. They have to stay outside. - Shall I say something? - Sure, go ahead. Please don't tell anyone. I go to work even when I'm on periods. Are you serious? Obviously, I can't afford to take off for 4 days a month. Then I'll be behind on rent and school fees. Moreover, no ones' going to care if I'm on periods or not. These traditions and rituals will only last until they run out of money. Once they run out of money, they'll disregard everything and continue tending to their jobs. You're quite a woman, sister. Come on, nothing of that sort. I have no other option. # Banyan tree at shore # # And Acacia below the shores # # There's coconut tree at the village swaying to the wind # A family is the simplest most basic form of grouping in society. It is defined as a durable association between husband and wife... with or without children. So, what are the characteristics of a family? A family can be a universal group. But mainly family by marriage. A family that is bonded from a marriage. It is created when a man and woman are married. In such families... father is the head of the family. - Mother-- - Sir, my mother is the bread winner. So, doesn't that make her the head of the family? You won't find this in your sociology textbook. But that's not a fact. No matter what, father will remain the head of the family. Sir, would you care to explain? That's a hard written rule. Employed or unemployed, the mother has to take care of the house. A mother can administer the house. But a father must administer the whole family. That's our cultural structure. Sir, why can't both mother and father be the head of the family? Sir, why can't both mother and father take care of the house? There goes the bell. We'll meet in the next class. Okay. Bye all of you. Sir, the lunch is ready. - I'll get you some water. - Don't bother I'll get it myself. Oh, no! Please stay put. If sir sees you then he'll yell at me. Shall I serve you more? That's enough. Shall I serve you rasam? A little. That's enough. Dear, I'm thinking of applying for a job. Job? - What kind of job? - Teacher, father-in-law. Teacher? Dance Teacher. Dance? Do you know to dance? Awesome! That won't suit our family. Mutton fry is very delicious. Are you upset? Don't worry. We'll handle it. Don't apply right away. We'll do it eventually when the time is right. Okay? Do you need anything else? Dear, don't you worry. You haven't got the job yet. - First you apply for it. When you get appointed we'll handle it. Okay, mother-in-law. Make sure no one knows that I asked you to apply. Okay, sure. - How is sister-in-law? - She doing well. Fine, I'll talk to you later. - Take care of your health. - Sure, dear. What's the occasion? You took me out for dinner. Nothing special though. I'm kind of bored of eating home-cooked everyday. You follow table manners when you're out in public. What did you say? I said, table manners. What am I doing wrong at home? What's the problem with my table manners at home? You put away the waste on a plate. That is my house. My wish! I'll stay as I please. Dear, I was just saying. Please don't get angry. I am not angry. What's the problem with my table manners? I am a school teacher. I'm well-mannered and I know how to behave in public. Understood? Listen... Sister-in-law has a due date for her delivery. Dear! Are you not going to talk to me? Do you feel what you said at the restaurant is right? Dear, I was just saying. Please don't take it seriously. So, you've been noticing my faults all along. Are you trying to taunt me? Trust me I'm not taunting you. I felt like saying and I did. Don't justify. Apologize, if you feel what you said was wrong. Sorry, dear. I may not be up to your mark. I have enough manners to stay mad until the person apologizes. Understood? Hey! Hello! Look at me. Ms. Manners! Come closer. Come on! Ms. Manners! Shall I switch off the light? Dear, please call the plumber. The entire kitchen is slimy with waste. The stench is making it impossible to work in the kitchen. Sounds like "waste" has become a problem to you. I'll call him. - Dear. - Yeah! Come out. A special guest has arrived. Don't call me a guest. I'm your best friend. - Uncle how are you? - I am doing well. You're like a father to me. - But my father is dead. But you're-- - Hey! Uncle I meant to say, bless me as if you're my father. - Go ahead! - Stay blessed! Hey, get blessings from grandpa! Not sure if he'll be alive the next time we visit. - What did you say? - Uncle, I meant to say you're very busy. You might not be available to meet. Hey, you too get blessings from him. Uncle, similarly once she took blessings from my father. Right after that he passed away. Since you've arrived you have been talking about death. - You've been ranting about death-- - Obviously, I drive a mortuary van. Got used to speaking about death. - Hey, your wife doesn't respect you? - Hey! - I am coming. - Make it faster. What brings you here? It's her niece's adolescence function. I thought of attending the function... also thought of meeting you guys on our way back home. Moreover, she's diabetic... - ...and her toe finger is affected. - You don't have to tell him that. I heard the homeopathy doctors are doing a good job out here. So, I decided to check it out. Uncle, who is your physician? - What's wrong with me? - Brother, how are you? Yes dear. Do you know how I am? - Yeah! - You know he is-- Hey, don't help her. Let her say. - Go ahead, dear. - I know. He has spoken about you. - Oh, so, you've already sang my praises. - Do you want tea? - Sure! - Dear, get tea for everyone. - Is there milk at home? - Yes we do. I don't want tea with milk. Get me a black tea. Not an issue we have milk. I'll get you milk-tea. Dear, black tea is good for health and digestion. Hey, have milk-tea. If you take milk after 6 pm, you'll end up dead soon. Do you want black tea or milk-tea? Shut up. Don't mind him. You get milk-tea. No wonder you're diabetic and your toe is affected. Not an issue sister. I'll get both. That sounds better. Dude, you never showed up for your aunt's function. Exams are on. I couldn't get off from school. - Are you going on pilgrimage this year? - Definitely! Even if you don't your father will make you do it. It's 'cause he's extremely devoted. Uncle, is the reason we go on a pilgrimage every year. Similarly, one year went on a pilgrimage. While we were in the forest... we both went looking for gooseberries. - But uncle got ambushed by monkeys. - What happened next? What do you expect? It was off-season for gooseberries. Monkeys got riled up and mauled uncle. Later, we had to bring him to the hospital. The scar on the chest is from that incident. Do you remember? Uncle do you remember? - I don't remember. - Obviously, you were dizzy. - Brother. Here you go. - Thanks, dear. Here you go. Father-in-law. - Please have. - I'll have later. Dear, what is this? - Black tea! - Is this how you make black tea? Just sugar and tea powder in hot water doesn't make it black tea. Do you even know how to make black tea? Add crushed ginger, with cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. Add garam masala and rice to it and biriyani is ready. Your loudmouth is the reason you're diabetic. Listen, follow my recipe and make the black tea. - Incorrigible! - Dear, make chapati and chicken. Uncle, I make good chicken. Hey, don't bother yourself with cooking. Why can't I cook? Ladies relax today. Gentlemen are going to cook. Uncle, help me peel garlic. His mouth is always wide open. Do you need any help? Sister, don't bother. Please take rest. I don't mind. Let me help you. Please don't bother. You're not well. You please go and rest. I can handle it. Okay. - Dear! - Yeah! - Get us tea. Uncle, how was dinner? You could've added more oil. If you wish to live longer. It's better you take less oil in your food. - Hey! - Why don't you join us for poker? I don't want to play. You guys carry on. Why? Did you see uncle... he's still playing a strong hand. Uncle, similarly my father played poker the night before he died. But in the morning he was dead. Idiot, enough of death talk. I'm telling you what happened. Why are you getting angry? Here you go. How's the tea now? Who would you say taught you to make tea? I will say that you taught me. Come on, join us for a game. Brother, I have work in the kitchen. Let me finish it. What work do you have in kitchen? We did all the work today. Uncle, this is how women are taking us for a ride. What? Go! Dear... Dear. Please come over here. - Tell me father-in-law. - What is this? It's the appointment order for dance teacher. I did mention earlier that this won't suit our family. Your mother-in-law holds double degree. Still, she's like my mother. Took care of the house... raised our children to be successful and now they're doing well in their lives. Women are Home Ministers. You're blessed to born as Home Administrators. These materialistic jobs are below compared to being a mother. Raise a prosperous family. That's your job. We have lived our lives. Take my advice to lead a prosperous life. Please speak to your mother-in-law. She'll give you the same advice. I clearly explained to you. Be patient and not to apply for a job right away. Now because of you I can't face my father. Did I ever stop you from going to work? I'm talking to you. Did I ever? I made it clear before we got married. No one said anything about it to me. Ask your parents, they'll explain everything to you. You're too arrogant. The other day you lectured me about manners. Where are your manners now? I'm planning to go on a pilgrimage. When? I haven't decided on the date yet. But I'm planning to go on a fast from tomorrow. Oh! If I go on a fast... we can't get intimate. Hope you're aware? Shall I switch off the light? Dear... if you don't mind, can I say something? When we get intimate... it hurts! Why can't we try foreplay? Oh! Sounds like you're well-aware of these things. - What do you mean? - I meant foreplay. See, I need to feel something for you, to try foreplay. But I don't feel you. I am sleepy. Switch off the light. That's how I feel. Hail Lord! Hail Lord! This is leftover right? You're right. I re-heated the sambhar from the refrigerator. Forgive me Lord. Aren't you aware that you're not supposed to serve leftovers to the pilgrims? Or you're doing this on purpose? Trust me I have no idea about it. That's great. You're not aware of important things. But you're aware of-- Forgive me Lord. People change with the time. To be honest, if you walk without shoes you're prone to diseases. Don't stress too much on this matter. - How are you brother? - I am doing well, dear. Her parents did not raise her well. They haven't taught her the way of life. - I have nothing to say. - I dropped everything and got here. I couldn't hold back after hearing the news. I panicked and left right away. - Where is she now? - She must be inside the house. Okay, I'll go and meet her inside the house. Oh, God, why are you sitting on the bed? Come on, get up! God help me! Don't you know you shouldn't sit on it, it's forbidden! Oh, no, I have to touch it with my bare hands. You should use only things that can be washed and dried. Understood? Didn't your parents teach you anything at all? If you don't wish to live here, please go to your relatives house. If not, the outhouse is empty, you can stay out there. Auntie, I'm a little scared to stay alone out there. Oh, yeah, you're scared! You're not a child. Move, make way. Make way. Sleep on this mat. I hope you understood. Don't just keep staring. Staring like an owl. Why aren't you eating well? Her cooking made me lose taste. Only today I got to eat delicious food. Come on, brother. I made everything in a haste. - That's enough. - Are you done? - How's the taste? - It's awesome. - Brother, how about salt... - It's good! Here you go! After your meal wash the plates and keep it with you. Don't step outside. Specifically, don't cross your path with the pilgrims. Understood? Don't come in contact with them. Hope you understood. Stop staring and eat. Have your food, dear! Listen, our family doesn't indulge in religious matters. But you should follow their family traditions. Mom, do you even understand what I am trying to say? I totally get you, dear. But it's important that you understand their tradition. Don't forget that you're one of the members of their affluent family. So, dear, please don't find faults. Mom! Fine, hang up! [News] Supreme court has announced that women can enter temples. It's our right to freedom. We are not bound to anyone. I will definitely visit the temple. Because the God is one for all. Women menstruate. That does not mean you can restrict women from age 10-50 from entering the temple. During your periods don't wash your clothes along with the others. Burn all the used sanitary pads. Don't throw them away at your will. You shouldn't anger the deities. Don't forget that one day you have to get pregnant too. Be careful. Hope you understood. Dear, what are you doing? You shouldn't touch the holy-basil when you're on periods. Aren't you aware of it? It's not that, I have cold and headache. Please go! Forgive her Lord. Go! Ma'am don't take me wrong. Can I borrow 500 rupees? Sure. But I'm not supposed to touch anything in the house. My wallet is inside the room, you please help yourself. Sure. Ma'am, hope there's no problem. Are you okay? I'm doing well. There's no problem. - Please go ahead. It's out there. - I'll see you around. Your undergarments are drying in the presence of men in the house. I put them out there because it's about to rain. There's a rope tied outside the outhouse, you could've used it. Clothes doesn't dry and stay wet causing infection. Oh, God, you're too arrogant! You talk-back too much. If you wish to dry your clothes, put them inside your room. Understood? Stop staring! Nod if you have understood! Okay. I have to teach her everything. Sister. Sister? What is it, Manju? I'm out here. I have something to show you. What is it? I'm going on a pilgrimage. I want to show you that. Oh, no, Manju, please don't come inside. Sister, why are you preventing me from coming inside the room? You're going on a pilgrimage. You're not supposed to see me. Who said so? Did God ever say it? To God, everyone is equal. That means I can see you, right. I brought you something. - What is it? - Guava! It's from the tree at our house. It'll be very tasty. Please try it. I hope you like guavas. Please remain yourself. Don't change yourself for anyone. Okay, sister. I'm leaving. I'll see you tomorrow. [Holy Chants] Oh, no! Are you hurt? Oh, God, please get up. Hey, don't you have any sense? You're not supposed to touch a pilgrim during this period. Go! She's on periods and she touched you. If you wish to repulse this incident... you'll have to swallow raw cow dung. Also, you'll have to drink cow urine. You'll have to do it all. If not, mix turmeric in the water and splurge it on your head. That will repulse the incident. - Are you sure? - Yes! - So, that'll repulse it. - Definitely! - Okay. God is great. - God is great. [Facebook] Supreme court has agreed to the motion to enter the temple. That's our freedom. No one has the right to stop us. Men still wish to control women by reducing them to working in kitchens. I'll definitely go to the temple. Because God is equal to everyone. Women are bound to menstruate. That does not mean you can restrict women from age 10-50 from entering the temple. If you're going to discriminate women based on it... then I believe it's not a God. No matter who oppose it. I wouldn't care less. I'll definitely go to the temple. No one has the right to restrict women from going anywhere. It's our wish! I'll be there soon. I'm about to leave. Please hang up. I am leaving dear. I left home in a hurry. So, my family is all riled up. - Tomorrow is the 7th day right? - Yes. Make sure to have head-bath and then tend to the chores. - Okay. - That's about it. See, now you're laughing. Okay, I'm leaving. She does look pretty when she smiles. Hey, Feminist woman, come outside! You haven't met a real man. Come outside we'll show you. We know who are your supporters. You'll realize your mistake only when we insult you in front of the public. How dare you start a revolution? Listen, you can only show off on Facebook. - I dare you to come down. - Burn down her scooter. If I see you again I'll kill you. Let's go! It's okay. It's okay, baby. Please ask your wife to delete the video she shared. You were once a trustee of the Temple. It doesn't bode well when one of our own does it. Did you read the comments on that video? They're horrific! It's an embarrassment to all. That's why we came over right away. Don't worry. I'll make sure she deletes it. God save us all! I was told you shared something disgusting on your Facebook wall. Delete that post immediately. I shared, because it felt right to me. I won't delete it. - Don't you understand? - Why does it bother you? Bloody, if I come inside-- I dare you to step inside. Do you think you can really step inside? I ought to-- Is your mannerism forcing others to do things that they don't consent to? Hey! Sister, I got milk. Place it out there and lock the door from the outside. Okay, sister. - Make two teas. - Sure! [Holy Chants] It's been long since I asked for the tea. - I'm on it. - Make it fast. Hey! It's a petty issue and you walked all the way home.
