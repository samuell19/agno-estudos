[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ STOOGES: Hello. [♪♪♪] [ALL SNORING] [MUMBLES] Mary, dear. My Mary. Sally, dear. [GRUNTS] I love you. Oh, Mabel, baby. I'm nuts about you. Your beautiful face. [COOING] And that cutest little button nose. And your smooth, smooth skin. [LAUGHS] Oh, smooth. Smooth. Uh-oh, your eyebrows need plucking. I'll do it, baby. Kiss me, Mabel. You send me. I'll send you. [GRUNTS] What's the idea kicking me? You woke me up. You were tickling my foot. Oh, I'm sorry. Good morning, fellas. MOE AND LARRY: Good morning. Hey, I-I better get going. What's the matter? What's the matter, Joe? Today is the day I get engaged to my Mary. February 7th. And I get engaged to Sally. And I get engaged to Mabel today. What a coincidence. Hey, speaking of coincidence, I'm starved. Do you think you could cook breakfast? I don't think, I know. I don't think you know, either. Now, let me see. "For fluffy, feather-like pancakes, two cups of Flipper's Fluffy Flapjack Mix." One cup. Two cups. "Add two eggs." "And one can of condensed milk." That can't be right. Can't eat paper. [SPITTING] Hey, Moe, give me a hand. Okay, Goldilocks. Here we are. Hey, what is this, Phi Sigma Delta? No. They're Flipper's Fluffy Ferblonger Flapjacks. Oh, a new sorority, well. Wait, the rest are for me. Okay, okay. Excuse me, fellas, I gotta make a phone call to my Mabel. Oh, my beautiful Mabel. MOE: Have some syrup, Joe. Thanks. You should see my Mary's eyes. My Sally's too. They're like two headlights on a dark night. My Sally's too. And teeth like pearls. Oh, my Sally's cheeks. Those lips. Those nose. Oh, she is simply divine. What a figure. Oh, my. All for me. Yeah, I'll be right over. You sure you love me, cute pie? Of course I do, darling. [KISSING] [KISSING] She loves me. She loves me. She loves me-- Oh. But she loves me. Oh, my Sally. My Sally. Hey, fellas, after we get engaged today, why don't we all come back here and have a little celebration. After all, we never met each other's "fye-in-sees." That's a good idea. Yeah, but we can't let our girls see that torn davenport. Well, don't worry about it. I bought new material to recover it. Hey, let's finish eating and we'll go to work. That's a good idea. Hey. Come on. I want this one here, this is. Here's one that I want. No, wait a minute. You-- I want this one. My girl proposed to me the minute she met me. Yeah, mine did too. You know, that's a coincidental. My future wife did the same with me. [CHUCKLES] There we are. The scissors slipped. You stupid idiot. Wait a minute, I can explain it. Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh, my nose. My poor, poor, little, cute, lovable nose. Aw, there, there kid. I was a little bit excited. Oh. Come on, you. Get outta here. Hey, imbecile. LARRY AND JOE: What? You get the tack hammer and the tacks. You help me stretch this material. Come on. MOE: Now be careful. LARRY: All right. I buy a two-pants suit, and this guy ruins the coat. LARRY: Gosh. Right here. Just a minute. I-I wanna do this right. I-I don't wanna miss. That's very encouraging. Ready? Now, right there. That's a cinch. Ouch! Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. I-I'm sorry, Moe. I-I never could see out of these "bicycle focals." Give me that. Get over there and tighten the other end of that thing, you imbecile, or I'll brain you. No. Go on. Oh. Get out of my way. MOE: Hey, porcupine, come here and help me. I gotta get another hammer. [SNAPS FINGERS] MOE: Stretch that material. LARRY: Okay, wait till I get a tack. MOE: Here, pound it in. Wait a minute. Wait till I get my finger out of the way. LARRY: Okay. [SCREAMS] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm scalped. Oh, Moe. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Moe. Nothing to worry about. No blood. If I had a machine gun, I'd blow you to ribbons. A machine gun. I got a brilliant idea, I'll be right back. You sponge head. Moe, I-I didn't realize I was holding the gun-- Shut up. [CHOKING] Here we are. Funnel. JOE: No, don't do that. You'll break the gun. Plenty of tacks. I got a hard head. Now, you watch your P's and Q's, see? Okay. L, M, F, F, P, Q. Hey, fellas, look. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's the idea of the rifle? That's a continuous-shooting automatic. I figured if a rivet gun can shoot rivets, this can shoot tacks. Oh, this is a smart imbecile. [LAUGHING] All right, stretch the material. Okay, kid. Here we go. [GUNSHOTS] What do you know? Look-it there. How was that? Great. Real "hamstitching." Come on, hurry up and finish. I gotta get over to my girl's house. Me too. Me three. JOE: Gee whiz, tha-tha-that's great. Like a professional. Boy, oh, boy. Larry, let me try it. No, wait a minute. This is my idea. JOE: Come on, let me try-- LARRY: No, I wanna do it. JOE: Don't be a stingy. Where's that tack? Let me. No, no. You can't. [GUNSHOTS] [MOE GROANING] Ouch, ouch, ouch! Oh, I'm losing my mind. Fellas, help. Ooh! Oh. Oh, Moe. Take it easy, Moe. We'll get 'em out. Hurry up. Here. Ooh, oh. Oh! Oh! Relax, Moe. [MOE SCREAMING] Take it easy, you're tearing my heart out. Oh! [MOE SCREAMING] Take it easy, Moe. [MOE SCREAMING] Here, take it easy, Moe. How do you feel? Like a Swiss cheese. You and your inventions. Ooh. I'll tack it myself. It's all your fault. It's your fault. You-- You're such a stingy. There. Yeah? You-- [SWALLOWS] [CRIES OUT] [GROANS] Suffering catfish, he swallowed the tacks. Quick, bend him over the couch. Come on. All right. The tacks won't come out. Well, they went in. They must be income tacks. Yeah-- Mm, jokes at a time like this. I got an idea. Put him on the couch on his back. Okay, doc. I'll get you, Moe. Everything will be all right. Just take it easy, Moe. Here, he'll get 'em out. Okay, open your mouth, Moe. Yeah. Cough, Moe. Cough. Cough sideways. Move that tonsil to the right. Cough sideways. No, no, move your right tonsil. There, there, there. Uh-huh. I see it. Hear the clicks, hear the-- Here we go. How's that? Hey. These tacks will never attack you again, Moe. But I will. Wait a minute. No, you-- Get outta here. Hey. Have an apple. Thank you. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, come in. I knew you were coming so I baked a cake. Thank you. And I got something for my little cutie pie too. Oh? Close your eyes. Open your eyes. Oh. There. Now, how about a little kiss? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh. It-It-It-- It's mama. [SNAPS FINGERS] I wanna break the news to her gently about us. Would you mind waiting in the left bedroom? The left bedroom, yes. Hurry up, there. [KNOCKING] Darling, come in. I knew you were coming so I baked a cake. Oh, fancy that. You're a honey bunny. Ha-ha-ha. Hey. What-What-What's-- Oh, this. I have bells on my finger and-- Ha-ha. --ring on my toe. [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh. How about a kiss? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] It's mama. I wanna break the news to her gently about us. Would you mind waiting in the right bedroom? The right bedroom, yes. Hey. Oh. Oh, darling. [KNOCKING] Hello, darling. Hi, limey pie. I knew you were coming so I baked a cake. Oh, how sweet, my-my darling. You shouldn't-a oughtn't-a done it. Come on, let's sit down here. You know, I-I didn't forget you, either. Oh? Now you can have me with you for always. [GIGGLES] WOMAN: Ah, Joe. [CAT MEOWS] [HISSES] BOTH: Pardon me. What are you doing in my girl's house? Your girl? She's my girl. We'll see about that. Come on. Yeah, all right, I'm with you, don't worry. JOE: Cutie pie. [GIGGLES] A-ha. Come here, you. What are you doing in my girl's house? Your girl's house? You mean my girl's house. You're both crazy, she's my girl. You hold your tongue. I can't. It's too slippery. Shut up. You shut up. [CRIES OUT] There. Why, you. No, wait a minute, Moe. No! Don't you dare-- [WHIMPERING] [SQUEALS] Hey. See that? What? Get outta here. Oh, I'm mad. I'm fighting mad. Oh. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. And you too. Why, you. [GRUNTS] Oh. LARRY: You dirty double-crosser. You're a triple-crosser. You stole my girl. Hey, she was my girl. Yeah, well, we'll fight for her honor. Put up your hands. Because, you see, when I was in the ring... [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Get out of here. I'll murder you. MOE: Take that, you worm. [LARRY GRUNTS] I'll fix 'em. I'll fix 'em all. LARRY: Yeah, take that. MOE: Ow! Oh. Get outta here. Steal my girl, hey? Ah. Oh! Oh-oh. Oh. Wise guy, eh? Do that to me, will you? Who do you think you are? MOE: Larry, I'll murder you. You-- Larry, I'll tell you-- Quiet. Quiet. Why, you-- [CLANGS] [BLOWS] [LAUGHS] So long, suckers. Don't be frightened, honey. Look what I got for you, a hundred dollar bill. Ooh, money. Oh, pardon me, it dropped. [GUNSHOTS] [WOMAN SCREAMS] Oh, Joe. [SCREAMING] You Jezebel, you. You three-timer, you. You cheater. [♪♪♪]
