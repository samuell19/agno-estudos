Not even soup yet! Must I wait with an empty stomach? No, I can't delay my plans any longer. What do you wish? Why are you so sad? Doesn't the love of your Klara - dismiss those grim thoughts? - I see you for a while, then I spend hours without hearing your sweet voice. - How can I be happy? - Love me, I said. You took my hand and asked if I loved you, even while you read the answer in my eyes. I didn't know what I was saying. I fear I have ignored our future. The endless discord between your uncle and my father is not a good omen for our love. We may face cruel separation. Unless... Unless? Think, find a solution! - Everything is up to you. - I'm listening. We love each other and we wish to live together in peace, free of fear that old feuds might force us apart. - What shall we do then? - Get married. - You're crazy! How? - It's up to you. Rather up the will of my uncle, and of your father. If there's a will, there's a way. I understand, but I don't agree. I want to be with you, - but not this way. - I meant marriage. Who'll believe that nothing happened between us? I hear someone coming, you must go. - One word... - I've said. - Change it or I'll die. - Then we'll die. - Klara, I beg you... - Go, quickly. God be with you. I got here as fast as I could. I wore out several horses and came in such haste that my new carriage was left in splinters. And I am sure, Papkin, that you came on foot, after gambling away in some tavern the money I sent for the journey. Look at my pistol then. - What about it? - I was shooting. At crows, no doubt. Whom I shot and where, I cannot divulge, but cards are not the reason for my delay. You know that men drop like flies when I start shooting. Men? - Who else? - Moths or mosquitoes? - You'll never believe it anyway. - I'm not a fool, my dear, dear sir. - That a breakfast?! - Yes, breakfast. My dear Cupbearer, I haven't eaten for six days and nights. - Then eat and listen. - Yes, sir! Everyone knows I never miss a shot. And everyone knows I could toss you in the dungeon for your past deeds. In the dungeon? What for? - Just for fun. - Can't you think of better one? Silence! Let me remind you where you stand with me. I am at your service. I will jump into the saddle this moment if you order it. I am a born horseman. The wildest of the wild are tame in my hands. - I am a born horseman. - Come on! As I was about to put my foot in the stirrups, - I was interrupted by a big scuffle. - Listen to me! Just a moment. Here I was walking along, my head up, my hair all curly, a proud look... any woman would've fallen for me. - Listen! - Wait. So there I was, and suddenly a Greek princess approached in her coach, took one look at me, and fell in love. You know, one thing led to another... when it comes to love I'm like a tiger. Quiet! - You seem a bit upset. - Enough of your chattering tongue! You are upset. If I had your temper, the blade of my trusty Artemis would... - I'm listening. - Klara's father bought this old castle along with the village. My father owned ten like it. We live here like owls, and to make matters worse, the owner of the other half of the castle is the devil incarnate. That's right - the Notary. He appears to be sweet and humble, - but the devil's in his soul. - Still, neighbors should get along. If I don't drive him out, nobody will. Not a day passes without a fight. We have to negotiate, but how? I won't write that scoundrel! Go to see him? He's too crafty, my dear, dear sir. He might secretly poison me, and I value my life. That is why I chose you to be my emissary. It is a great honor indeed, but I fear I am too hot-blooded. Instead of making peace I might start a war, for I was born to perform heroic deeds. What's more, as an infant I swore never to be a diplomat. Papkin will be, who I tell him to be. And you obey. But I am a bad-tempered man. What if I strangle him, shoot him right in the head, or cut him into pieces? - Who'll take the responsibility? - Me and my conscience. - Think it over. - I just have. Now, I've got more news. My dear sir, I am getting married. - Well, well! - Well, well what? Well, I'm so happy! What can I do to speed the matter along? Persuade her, if timid? Force her, if unwilling? And if she is married, should I slit the throat - of her tyrant? - You're crazy! - You know of my courage, Cupbearer. - Listen... I mean no insult, but I'm a thousand times smarter than you. But when it comes to conversing with ladies, it's beyond me, I can't do it. So, my dear, dear sir, with your charm. You can count on it. She's as good as yours. Already married to you. I have an unusual way with women. Just one look, and they are mine. - So I will just go have a look... - At whom, then? - You're right, I do not know. - At the Widow Hanna. - I see. - Wait for her here. Say no more. It will be settled within the hour. - You know how grateful I can be. - I hope I'm about to find out. He's a madman. Very volatile. If I didn't have him on a tight leash, I don't know what would happen. There is no time to spare. I'll get the Widow for him. She's not my type, anyway. But Klara... oh, lovely Klara will be mine. I know she is dreaming about me... We'll populate the world with lots of little Papkins! But the Cupbearer stands like a wall between us. I will give her a sign. I'll sing a sweet song in her little ear... with my angelic voice. Oh my dear daughter, what are those whispers in your room? Mother, it was the cat, lapping its milk. It was the cat making noises in my room. Oh my dear daughter, what are those knocks in your room? Mother, it was the cat, hunting for mice. It was the cat making noises in my room. Oh my dear daughter, does your cat have legs? Mother, he does, and silver spurs too. It was this cat making noises in my room. I told you, it's either a bunch of cats, or Papkin has showed up. Madam, you are an angel! A colossal embodiment of earthly virtue, draped in grace and charm. Allow my lips to leave their delicate impress on your snowy white hands. I am your humble servant, and at your service. - What brings you to us? - A wonderful event! - What is this? - Your marriage. Mine? I have just hosted Lord Pembroke, several princes, a dozen chamberlains, and a few elegant ladies at a supper. - What do they say? - Of course you, fair lady. Everyone has been whispering that the Widow Hanna has a suitor. But who is it? Everyone compliments you on your choice. - Now I understand... - He is wealthy, and well bred. The Cupbearer has sent him. What irony. This is exactly what I've been waiting for! For God's sake, she's fallen in love! Look how she sighs and glances at me. Is she mad? I'm irresistible, I know. Like all women, she must fall in love with me. It's my curse. But this is no laughing matter. The Cupbearer will have my head. No, I can't let it go on any longer. May I then congratulate the Cupbearer on the good news? So he's the one? Why do you doubt me? Have I ever lied to you? - Yes, you have. - But this time... - I'm telling the truth. - Why such curiosity? What if the Cupbearer, madly in love, charmed with your beauty, fell down on his knees and begged for your hand? He would be happy with the answer. How can you be so calm when the Notary has just declared war on us? He'll see for himself who he's tangling with! Go stop them! - What's up? - He's repairing the border wall! He's hired 3 masons. How dare he! I will beat them up and knock down the wall. Down to the ground! - To the ground... - I swear! Take the servants and go! If the masons don't obey, use force. You're trembling. I'm so eager to fight. But first would you listen to my new ode? What? It's an ode to peace. Perhaps the Muse will calm your ire... Stop it. Stay there. ...or I'll end up all black and blue. My dear mason, I respectfully request that you stop building this wall, or you might get hurt. Though I have much respect for the artistry of your craft, I humbly advise you masons here present to go to hell. Nothing gets through to them! Are they deaf, or what? Grab them by the neck and pull them from the wall! Quietly and nicely, with no trouble. Don't worry, I'm right behind you. Get out! Get lost! Wait! What's going on? My master doesn't want the wall finished. That's right. I ordered it, and I have the right. Stop the work! - What right do you have? - The wall should remain as it was. Dear neighbor don't be so unreasonable. The wall must be finished. Over my dead body! Finish your job, my friends. Pay no attention - to what he says. - Is it war you want? My dear neighbor! Stop acting like a bandit. What did you say? - Beat them up! - I am with you, Master mason. Do not be afraid! Let them interfere! Let them strike you! It's not the end of the world! I will take the case to court and the Cupbearer will rot in jail! Get me my gun! I'll shoot the louse. Hurry! That does it. Pay them for their efforts. But disarm them. That's it for today. You, get out of my way, or I'll beat you to a pulp! I'm anxious to do it. How many of you are hiding there? Come out here! Out the hole, you scoundrels. Cowards! I will tear the whole castle down! Why should I go back there if you're going to tear it down tomorrow? Take me captive and keep me here. - You surrender? - I do, sir. - You heard of my courage? - Naturally. - Afraid of me? - Terribly. - You'll do as I say? - Yes, sir. - Who are you? - I'm right here. - What are you then? - I'm... I'm... - What do you mean? - I am my master's emissary. - The Notary's? - Indeed. How very interesting. Any old nobleman as soon as he pays his debts, feels he must hire an emissary. No wonder so many noble owners end up servants to their own clever emissaries. This prisoner will make the Cupbearer very glad. Maybe when he sees him and hears of my bravery, Klara will finally be mine. - Let's go, prisoner. - Coming, sir. Well, foreman darling, speak up. Everything must be documented. In such hard times such beating is a gift from God. We'll profit from every punch. - All know you got mugged. - Not that bad. - You've been beaten. - Not really. What? They were obviously beating you. - Just some elbows... - Nothing to complain about. - An elbowing doesn't tickle. - Well, true. - It wasn't a caress. - Well, true. - So it's a beating, then. - Certainly. If somebody takes a stick to your back, you're being beaten. And if you're being beaten, you'll end up beaten up. You're right. Being beaten is beaten up. So you were beaten, that is obvious. It seems so. - Injured? - Not at all! - Not at all, my friend? - Oh, no. Not a scratch? A bruise? - We might have one or two. - And a scratch, obviously, is a small wound. Well, yes. Small or large, a wound is a wound. And where do wounds come from? From an injury. So if somebody has a wound, his body is injured. A scratch is an obvious wound. So you are wounded, deprived of bread and work. Oh, come on! Deprived, my darling. You won't get any work from me. Injured, deprived of bread and work, - a wife, 4 children... - No children. - No wife. - You're young. You can have them. - True enough. - The complaint is finished. You will testify that Cupbearer tried to kill me. He went mad - and shoot at me. - I didn't see. - Called for a gun. - Didn't hear. He called for a gun, but to shoot a louse. Shoot a louse... Enough! I'll find witnesses elsewhere. Come here... Closer. Put down your mark. Michal Kafar. Down a bit. Yes, yes! Maciej Mietus. Lovely! There's money in it for you. Cupbearer will have a fit. I humbly request... - What about our money? - Cupbearer will pay for everything. That's not right. - You won't lose out. - But we worked here... Go with God, or I'll throw you out! - But our pay... - Anyone would say! Out, or I'll smash you! God be with you, my good men. I will get rid of the Cupbearer even if I have to pawn my clothes. He'll try to sue me... but my plan to steal the Widow Hanna for my son will hurt him more than any court sentence. I'm exhausted, I can hardly walk. What a workout! I fought like the devil! I'm barely alive! Order some wine, good wine. My mouth is dry and I'm all sweaty. - Who could ever appreciate that? - I saw what you did. You did? - Wasn't I amazing? - Amazing at hiding. A good warrior can fight anywhere. What nerve! It took a lot of nerve to fight so fiercely. You're lying, dear, dear sir. You've got to hear this. Trying to take the scaffold, I leapt so nimbly I landed on the other side. Surrounded by thousands of masons, servants, soldiers. I grabbed two of them by the hair, spun them around in the air and mowed down dozens with each sweep until there was a hill of corpses around me. When it reached the top of the wall, I marched back to our side. And then... Oh, enough! And on top of it all, I took a prisoner. Now, I await my reward. Say what? I've captured the Notary's emissary. What do I need him for? Brave men like me take prisoners. May God be with you, and tell your master that if he dares provoke me again he won't know what hit him. Now get lost. Quickly! You try to help, you fight like Achilles, think like Cato, they just get jealous, and you're left with nothing. May I dare say a few words? You're angry cause your neighbor occasionally... Occasionally? Always! - The Notary... - Not a word about him! Both sides should give a little. Forgive, and there will be peace again. Me? Peace with him? My dear, dear sir. The sun will stand still and the seas will dry up before there'll be peace between us. You're upset now, and making hasty judgments. May God protect us from wind, fire, war and men who bow too low. - Better low than not at all. - Nonsense. - But... - No buts! Don't deprive me of hope, sir. But I do a hundred times. I want to hear nothing from him, or his preacher, else they get what they deserve. - The Devil burns in his soul. - No way to reconcile them. - Little profit - too much trouble. - They're like fire and water. What will happen to us, young Master? I'll have to remain your prisoner. It puzzles me what made Widow Hanna fall for a reptile like that. But she may be willing to change her mind. Though an older man may be vigorous, youth has its privileges. But if the Cupbearer finds out that he has been fooled... Oh my goodness... he may fly into a rage. Well, may God's will be done. One must always accept fate. The devil take you, and go with God. I won't go. I'm staying. What a stubborn pest you are! See here, friend, do you know what that is? Shake it a bit. Gold? Gold. - It might be yours... - Please, have a seat. ...but there's nothing for free. How true. What should I do? I haven't seen any profit from my recent efforts. My pockets are empty. I love Klara. - More unsettling news. - I want to be near her. - That's bad. - Why bad? Not necessarily bad, but the Cupbearer... ...won't approve. - He wouldn't know. - But if? - Let him accept me. - It's hard. - That's for a start, - the rest is up to you. - And if he catches me? - Don't worry. - Easier said than done. Is a mere emissary such as you worthy of Klara? I am Waclaw. The Notary's son! Good God! In this house! We are both in trouble. That sounds beautiful. Consider it yours, if I remain in service here. - Well, I'll try... - You'll get this later. Remember, if you betray me, you'll be an easy target from my tower. One bang and Papkin is stretched out flat. Out of respect for me, put your threat aside, - and I shall act as you wish. - Don't waste time. I'm going, I'm going... It's a devilish bind. Poverty beckons and my captive is also my rival. Any way you look, it's dreadful. One would lock me up, the other shoot me. The hell with them! - And the purse? - It must stay. - Are you sure? - Yes. Oh dear God, what are you doing here? I should despair, if I only had the time! - What is going on? - Don't act stupid. I know everything. I was listening. - You want to stay here? - What's wrong with that? - Be sensible. - Why should I? We've already seen that being sensible will only keep us apart. Why stay sensible? We have to think of something that will bring us together. Let's take a bold step forward and reach for our goal despite the obstacles. If we we'll be persistent we can accomplish anything. Yes, let's be bold. You've convinced me. This is better than running off together. What if someone recognizes you, or Papkin betrays you? Don't look into the abyss, rather drown your worries in the depth of our love. Stay here then, in God's name. You have my consent. Your permission helps us little. We may yet convince my uncle. Widow Hanna can help us, since they just declared their love. She is so modest, yet she promised him her hand. It should be easy for you to flatter her. Praise her wisdom, virtue, beauty and you can have any position in our house. From emissary to servant, isn't that suspicious? But it's an honor, to be in the Cupbearer's service. I'll tell Widow Hanna. An hour ago she fainted from fear and now she's fearless. She saw no chance for success, now she has hope for two. O fair sex, beautiful and dear, your joys and sorrows are like gentle wavelets on a lake, always chasing one another. As one bows down, other rises. But in the light of the golden sun they are pure and endlessly one. And we men? We, proud rulers of the world, are chasing this disappearing shadow, and live our lives, from each moment to the next, like flitting butterflies. Congratulate me. I've just gotten engaged. The Widow Hanna has given me her promise. I know how difficult it was. It was my hard work! Your work? Really? I'll tell you how it was. It was the perfect moment. She received me sweetly, winking, eyeing me flirtatiously. Straightaway I began to woo her. What a fuss she made not this, not that, this way, that way. And I kept on. 'Midst the giggle, 'midst the chatter, closer, ever closer... then smack! I planted a kiss. It caused her to blush, and I was confused. I wanted to run away. And then, my dear, dear sir, she called to me: "Wait, Matthew - your will be done, I humbly accept. Take this ring, and may God grant us luck." Devil take it! Great performance! - Show respect, damn it! Or else... - You are so quick to anger. It's a good thing I'm even-tempered... - We have more important things. - I think so. This young man from the Notary wants to know if he can stay in your service. True, he is fit and faithful but... everyone says he likes the bottle. Whether he likes it or not, there is no place for him here, as I won't pick up Notary's garbage. Have hope, the happy moment is near... Where is this petitioner - and what does he want? - Your humble servant. - Yes, young man? - Allow me be so bold as to raise my gaze to you. - It's you! - Hanna? - Waclaw! - I'm speechless... - What a coincidence! - So, you are the Widow! - Didn't you know? - What to say, what to do? Didn't you know that my third husband, may he rest in peace, married me in spring but died in the autumn? I remember now. - He drew his last breath on my lap. - Did he? Yes, you must have... I cried at first, but even sorrow drowns with time. - So he drowned? - Who told you that? That's not what happened? So, I have to go. Why? You can't leave. - You must be crazy! - That is possible. I will tie you up. You'll be my prisoner, dear Prince! Don't call me Prince. I'm so ashamed of my youthful misdeeds. The name and princely title I gave you were... - What? - Made up. - All made up? - To the last. - You're not a Prince? - Not a bit. - Why did you make it up? - For adventure. I was young and restless. - But you still love me, Waclaw? - I'm caught in her trap! Why are you blushing? I waited for you, looked for you, but nobody had ever heard of my Prince. I was young. Young, but very talented at seduction! - I wouldn't say that. - But there is proof. - What kind of proof? - You were unfaithful to me. One cannot always love constantly, but you should not scold me for that, for you didn't wait so long either. Your husband passed away you received the Cupbearer, and if he died you would seek out the next bachelor. I'll make no accusations, and I wish you all the best. We learned from each other, and in truth there can be no deceit where there is no love. - But I am a widow now! - And I'm almost married. Tell me who you really are. - Waclaw Milczek. - The Notary's son! - Here, in this house! - I got lost. I cannot believe this! My heart is pounding. The Cupbearer will find you here, and see you as his rival. He won't. Don't deny you begged to see me. - What is it that you want? - I don't know myself. Farewell! You haven't changed. Stay, do not go away. Oh, Papkin, I didn't know where my captivity would lead. You are the only one I loved. I prefer you to a hundred princes! Come secretly into my room. It will be safe there, I will protect you with my life... ...and I will expect my reward. - And so? - This is... - No one at all! - What does he want then? - What shall I say? - It all goes well, she is on his side. - You can tell me. - Oh, why bother? His matter is rather serious and we need to deliberate alone. Don't mention his presence here. I will explain it all later. - I'd better go. - I forbid you. Please follow me, Sir. Your case is difficult. I have to refer to the documents. Please, dear Klara, not to mention this - to anyone. - No one will know. Or there may be trouble. I'll tell you everything later. Nothing looks more funny than to watch the deceived deceiving. How he begged for help. I could hardly keep from laughing. But I must be patient, this game has only started, and is not yet won. You are the morning dew that restores life to the withering desert lily as it lifts its fertile face to the shimmering azure sky. Oh my gracious, honey-lipped Klara. I was close to fading, until your gaze revived me. May the gods allow me to bow at the altar of your passion before time wields her lonely scythe. It's an honor to have a master of rhyme and military art for a husband. But these days young men flatter to seduce us. I'm not that gullible. Good Heavens, do I have to take an oath to prove I love one so beautiful as you? Even an oath cannot guarantee your constancy. May the flower of your love send its delicate roots - deep into my fertile heart. - In the old days, a true knight won his wreath of glory before declaring his love. He fought for the honor of his beloved and only when he won, would he beg his beloved to open her heart, assuring her he was ready to live and die for her. From this costume and armor you can see I am a warrior. Would that my trusty blade Artemis, swollen with blood like a sponge, were able to speak she'd convince you! Where there was a fortress on a cliff, a wall beset with cannons, sharp waves of bayonets, vaults of sabers - there stood Papkin, lion undaunted, noble swordsman! Please forgive the jealous thunder of my exaltation, but I have sufficient fame. All I lack is the permission to be among Klara's suitors. I permit you. Please take my vows. Easy! Now it's time for proofs of obedience, endurance and courage. Queen of eternal beauty, Ornament of Mankind, order me to jump into the fire, and I will perish in flames. I am not that severe! You, the jewel of knights, shall not burn. But let me just repeat: I demand three tests. Each is cause for glory. To show you are obedient you mustn't speak for six months. Not a word? That's it. And to prove your endurance you must live on bread and water... - But not too long. - A year and 6 days. I am already dead, but always at your service. And now to the test for courage. Listen. In a distant land a monster threatens even the bravest. It is called a crocodile. Capture it for my amusement. I am curious to see it alive! This is my unshakeable will. He who accomplishes these tasks will lead me to the altar. That one I'll marry. Crocodile! That's all she wants! Oh yes, thrill and excitement are in fashion now, so young girls dream of crocodiles! Now they want something deadly or ugly. In the past a small canary would suffice. Now if you don't want me to die fetch me dear a crocodile. Fasting, silence - that's easy. She won't guard me all along. But a crocodile's a serious matter. For the devil, not for me! - What? - Nothing. Here - keep silent. - You know? - I know. I know? I know nothing. Is he staying, is he leaving? All I do know is that this is gold, but I may get a very different kind of payment from Cupbearer's sword. And if I cheat Waclaw he will blow my head off but the Cupbearer might do the same anyway. So I know and I know nothing - a true Devil's bargain: A bullet here, and a saber there. As a wise man once said: "Happy who has". You're right on time my dear son. Let's talk. Your favors, though rare, are a precious gift. I have been pleading with his Majesty in your favor to assure a bright future for my child. You are my only hope, and my enemies are jealous of us. They seek to divide us and would take pleasure in my pain, - as in your fall. - I don't get it... Don't you? This girl, Klara. She is precious and I adore her. But in secret. I have kept it secret 'cause I wanted to make peace - between neighbors. - Me and the Cupbearer? My God! Who could desire this more than I, a righteous man? - So let Klara and me... - No, this can never be. The Cupbearer looks for trouble, I am a peaceful type. Don't blame her for her crazy uncle. You need a different wife, and you'll get one, darling! A harsh judgment, dear father. I will not be swayed. But my happiness is your only goal. As God is my witness. - But I love her. - You just think so. - I won't survive. - Don't threaten me. - I swear. - Be quiet! May God's will be done. But tell me darling, if you are so constant, what about your past adventures? Nothing to say? Hard to believe, but the old man knows it all. - I was young. Maybe... - Well, the Widow, once your true and only love, is staying with the Cupbearer. - She's engaged to him. - I'll believe it if she tells me. Will she? I have spoken to her about this, and, God willing, she will accept the hand of my son. But I will not accept hers. God be thanked for an obedient son. I have prepared a marriage contract, wherein I state that the first party to break the agreement, pays the other 100,000 gold coins. My happiness is priceless. - She can make you happy. - I'll die first. In any event the Cupbearer will kill us even before. No, the Cupbearer will hang first. May God's will be done. You must accept it. - Father! - Son! - Don't plunge a knife into my heart. - Every cloud has a silver lining. - Change your decree! - Impossible. - Have pity! - Oh, you have it. Look, I am crying. - Can I have hope then? - No, no, dear, impossible. - This grief will drive me insane. - Look I am crying. Say no more! Virtue is the strongest foundation. Virtue is a seed which sows... But you are too young to know. Because of my actions, and for a hole in the wall, the Notary wants to sue me. You will go, my dear, dear sir, and summon him to the three hills in Blackwood. He'll run if I cut him. - Better write him. - God forbid! I have not the skill for all those explanations. I must admit that lately I haven't been myself. I can see that. - So... - Don't try to get out of this. Have mercy, please. Don't send me there. I'll be dead before you slice off his ear. Didn't you say the Notary might go as far as to poison me? - Why on earth... - It's not so farfetched... Stick with me and nothing will happen. - The devil never sleeps! - Nonsense! And if he...? Let him try. I would tear him apart! So what? I'll be dead! Listen, Papkin... Do it, and your pockets will never be empty again. - May I? - Please come in. It is an inconceivably great honor to visit you, Notary, master of such... - a worthy house. - Yes. I am at your humble service. May I ask whom I'm honored to receive? This little nobleman downplays his title so, I won't have to flatter him so much. I am Papkin. I'll be able to handle this myself. I am Papkin, the lion of the North, famous captain and chevalier, and so on and so forth. Wise in counsel, brave in battle, war spirit and peace enemy. The Swedes, Muslims, Saxons, Italians and Spaniards all know my famous blade and the arm that wields her. In short, the globe knows Papkin! Now, give me some wine. I'll bide my time. This nobleman is a coward. Let's see what's he got. Weak stuff! - Hog wash. - He's quite bold. Real swill. Got anything better? Please forgive me sir, there's nothing else. Typical nobleman! They sit in their villages, plow and sow, grumble and mumble, and haven't got any good wine! When they get you a bottle, the very label frightens you. Stop this! Just bring me something better. But sir... Dull and sour beyond belief. - Real swill, my dear Notary. - I must be patient. May God's will be done. Visit my cellars. I've drinks from half the world, hundreds of kegs in a row. Find such bad wine there, and you'll get a horse. If I may ask, my dear sir, what brings such a warrior into my humble abode? - You want to know? - Gladly. I am here, you scoundrel, because his Excellency the Cupbearer was attacked in his castle by a horde of your servants worthy of their master, I now see. Quietly, please, your lordship, I hear you well. - I will speak as I please. - But I have a headache. A herald can't turn his voice into a nightingale's just because you've got a headache. Mind you, I could have you thrown out the window. - And it's a long way down. - There is no need. - Is someone there? - Please, don't bother. You'll fly out of here like a little feather. You four, - wait behind the door! - There's no need, my good neighbor. Now I am listening. Tell me... Why are you here? You're upset. I didn't know you had such tender hearing. Let me know if I speak too loudly. Will you finally tell me? Right, right... The Cupbearer politely requests... Louder? So, the Cupbearer asks... Or rather informs you... that this unpleasant controversy should be immediately ended. Yes, I am putting this right... the unpleasant controversy... that is... well, this is... A devil in his eyes twists my tongue so. I cannot understand a word, sir. Speak plainly. It's because... I mean... Forgive me sir. The wine was strong and I am not the best speaker... - Those four still behind the door? - So what does he want, my good neighbor? - The envoy is somewhat... - Afraid? Darling, you don't have to be. The Cupbearer requests, sir, that you meet him at the three hills in Blackwood... with your sword to end this dispute. My old Cupbearer is still spirited! All know that his blows always hit the mark. He's nicked the noses of all the squires around... - Softer, please... - Of course. Softly then, I am requesting you on his behalf, asking you for a short and clear answer. I'll write to him. But is there time, since he's getting married - tomorrow? - Those are different things. The ring in the morning, at midday the sword, in the evening a tankard, and at night... Softly. Yes, softly. Risky business, this. How did I get mixed up in this? Does his future wife dote on him? She faints daily for love of him. And he burns for her like a candle! They will be a perfect couple and upon my life she will be faithful and true. Perelka! See to it things go smoothly tomorrow. Or you'll regret! Show the world what you can do! Spare neither cinnamon nor nutmeg. Everything must be perfect! You have saffron for the fish, plenty of sweetmeats - prepare us a feast! What initials shall I put on the centerpiece? M and H... for Matthew and Hanna; hearts on top, and VIVAT beneath. Be sure it's well done. Sir, all will be as you wish. I am here as you requested, to prove that I have changed my mind. I have wasted no time in thought, for I prefer to act fast. So without even saying: "Goodbye, my dear old, I prefer your neighbors to you" I have decided to sign your contract. I am giving you one copy, and one stays with me. Now that we have our guarantees, I greet you as your son's wife. This is a great honor, my gracious lady. Fortune's golden vessel unfurled her sails for me when you took my proposal into your heart. My fair lady, it's a great kindness to me and my heirs that you will share, from your great kindness, my son's bed. Allow me to invite you, offer all the services required and fall at your dainty feet as your servant... and footstool. What's this I hear? What the devil! He's snapped up his wife and is matching her with his son. Surely the Cupbearer will gut him like a fish! Don't think that I've changed my mind just for the sake of change. I've known your son Waclaw for years, indeed, I shall no longer conceal the fact I have loved him, and he has loved me truly. - This way! - What's this? Papkin here? Yes, I wait humbly for you to see me. Do you tolerate him? Out of my sight! - Bye. - Wait... - I am waiting. - Your copy. He fooled me. His lies made the promises I now regret. Me? If you hadn't interceded I'd be in the hands of a tyrant. - Bad luck! - May God's will be done. One must always accept fate. One more thing - as the Cupbearer knows nothing of this change, Papkin will deliver this confirmation and tell him what's in the letter. He'll ruin me! Give him your message, and I'll add a few words. Is this all true? What are you thinking? - Have you no conscience? - Softly. Yes, softly... This devil even hears through the walls! What are you doing! You'll get us all killed! You know the Cupbearer he won't tolerate this insult. He'll hurl death at your walls and lay this house to waste. For God's sake, let's get out of here! Oh, you have no idea what a fearful trap awaits... Were it not for Artemis' awful might... Hush! May God preserve us! Through the door and down the stairs. - The way is clear. - Not quite. Four men on guard. Take this message to the Cupbearer. Be polite and tell him I painfully regret that I must part with him this way. Nonsense! - I won't tell him. - Softer, please. Yes, yes, softer. Here is the letter for my neighbor. A most hazardous mission. - Goodbye, sir. - Papkin thanks you - for receiving him. - Not at all. - And he salutes you. - At your humble service. - I know the way. - That's not proper. - But sir... - You first. - I implore you. - Are you there? - No need for ceremony. - Show this gentleman the way. Please, I can manage. Take him by the arms, but be gentle. The stairs are dark. You are too kind... May God's will be done. One must always accept fate. Papkin has been gone for quite a while. The Notary is hiding like a fox. If he wants it that way I'll reach in and drag him out. Yes, sir. The one who gets in your way does not soon forget it. Even the most clever bureaucrat can't keep up with me. How true. Lady Barska, noble blade! Remember Slonim, and Podhajce? Remember Berdyczow, and Lomazy? How well you served me in those places. But on the other hand it has sturdy handle, my dear, dear sir. Tho' I prefer the damascene. This sword has finished off more than one deputy. Many more will remember it. "When it's raised it barely flashes, when it sings, go greet your Maker". Time is running out. Quickly, get on your horse and spread the word. Tell everyone clearly that the Bridegroom is inviting them to the wedding feast. Understood? On your way! So there you are! I'm parched. Let me have a drink first. What a task! First I stuffed his nose with pepper 'til it grew 3 times its size... Now we'll hear a story. But this Notary is a very lively man and a real devil to boot. I nearly drew Artemis from her scabbard but was afraid he might hex me. What a lying hound! When will I learn about the Notary? Well, he received me politely... - and gave me some wine. - Probably poisoned. - What did you say? - Nothing... - But... - So what then? - Poisoned, you say? - That scoundrel is no joke. - Something's burning me... - How did he react to my summons? Well? Hey! Are you deaf and dumb? We'll find out from the letter then. What? What? What! That, that, that... - The Widow... ...has deceived us. - To the Notary... ...she has gone. To the Notary? To him? And she wants to marry... Waclaw. And you said nothing, you cursed creature! But the whole affair won't last long. O treacherous sex, unworthy of respect. If you were here right now this is what I'd do... She'll want to hear about this! I'd grind you into powder. But no time now. I'll hire a fiddler for their wedding! He'll scratch until their ears burst and the Notary is twisted in knots. I'll teach him not to meddle in my affairs. Let's go, my dear, dear sir! Something hurts right here. Oh, it's burning. That dull wine is an awful poison. You traitor! Such a lovely rose you are destroying. Is it possible, Dyndalski? Is what possible? That this devilish Notary is killing me with his poison? Come on now. You don't believe it? Who would bother to poison you? - Nothing bad will happen to me? - No. But the Cupbearer said... Well, that's different. If he said so, then it must be true. Our master knows everything. Poisoned, you say? What mischief! What's your advice? What shall I do? You should send for a priest. What a scoundrel! Dying... dying. Oh good Lord! Had I lost my head? I abused him, so he fixed up a treat for me. He took the bottle, poured the whole glass, and yes, I drank it. I am poisoned! I will not make it. It is time to write my will. I shall pay for my coffin and funeral. And then... rest in pace. I won't do it that way. It's too easy. Mine will be a better revenge, with some new tactics. If only I could trap his son. There'll be plenty of time for the father. - Let me in... - I am writing my will. Stop that or I'll send you to the madhouse. You mean it? Now I'll seal it. Sit down. Dip your pen, and write what I dictate. I'm not so quick with a pen. We need a woman's hand now. Ransom a life - to hook the suitor. It will work! - Thanks God! Write exactly as Klara would write to Waclaw. - Oh! Oh! - What does "Oh! Oh!" mean? Sir, this will be offensive to her... Don't ask questions. Dip your pen and write. That's it! It takes talent, my dear, dear sir to render this well. It must have all that nonsense, all that lovers' babbling. How to start this, my dear, dear sir? Truly beloved... Too wifely. We need something more subtle. Half a word here, half a word there. Now you know. But you're not learned in that. Just write. Wait a moment... "Be so kind..." What is that? "B". - That? - Capital "B". A capital letter, sir. That's a straight line, but where are loops? One down here, other up. What the devil? That's capital "B"? Out! Capital "B"... I guess if you look hard. Write, sir, very carefully. "Be so kind... my dear, dear sir... my dear, dear sir my petition... my dear, dear sir to consider... my dear, dear sir to consider... as proof of trust... my dear, dear sir, or your Lordship... who although little known to you... who although little known..." What's this! Oops! An ink spot, sir, but I'll turn it into a letter. One more spot, and I'll rap your knuckles! Read now... What have you got there? "Be so kind... my dear, dear sir... my dear, dear sir... my petition... dear, dear sir... to consider..." Go to the devil, you empty-headed cretin! "Dear, dear sir" the idiot writes! Your very words, sir. Shut up! Write it again, without "my dear, dear sir" everywhere. - There won't be much left. - Write again, I said. You've got no brains. Sit down. - Sit, I said! - I am. Repeat after me. "Be so kind, dea..." Dea... What! What does "dea" mean? I cannot work with this dunce! I must think of something else. Perhaps I should send a messenger instead. Get lost - no, wait... No one knows what the Notary's son looks like. Everybody knows him, he was here this very morning. Who? The emissary? That's the one. So he came into my house and you never mentioned it to me! - This gold shut me up. - Dear God! You scoundrel! With one foot in the grave I'm no longer afraid of you. What good is money to me now? Shut up! Who needs it? What would I do with it? Keeps my pockets full. Be quiet. No time now. You will still account to me for your actions. Call Rozia and send the old witch to sneak into the Notary's house and tell Waclaw that Klara asks him to come to her secretly. She'll tell him that I'm not at home. Do you understand? - To the letter. - And you, take some people and hide near the break in the wall. Grab him when he comes. Tie him up if he resists. Such treatment is an insult. You were and still are an idiot. Just do as I say. - Cupbearer. - What? As a witness... Go to hell! "Go to hell"... there's gratitude! As usual, everyone thinks only of himself. Fine when things go right, then "go to hell!" He's stubborn as a mule! In all my life I haven't seen such things. He is truly a knave today. Why does he treat me like a schoolboy? What does he think? What is wrong with my "B"? What does it lack? Wrong shape or maybe the size? God, this is the cross I have to bear! O my dear, merciful Klara! My body is poisoned, but my heart loves you still! What happened? I'm a dead man. I would fetch you crocodile and win your hand, but it's time for me... to end this knightly suffering. He's lost his senses! I entrust my will to you. Please listen like a mother, and weep on my grave. "I, Joseph Papkin, the son of Jan Papkin..." Yes, his name was Jan... "Being of sound body and mind, but unable to predict when I'll die because I have been poisoned by the Notary's wine..." A little wine... "I am writing this to dispose my real and other property. Of the real I cannot dispose, because I have none. The other goes: To the one I have always loved and honored - fair Klara Raptusiewicz the lady of Zakroczym - I leave my English guitar and a rare collection of butterflies, presently in pawn. My Artemis, previously pledged to the Cupbearer, to the most valiant knight in Europe if he erects a monument on my grave. The rest of my things bury with me. The executors of this will are his Excellency the Cupbearer and Klara, but they should not pay my debts as I desire to leave them as mementoes to my brothers of different rank and faith. Jozef Papkin" Just Jozef Papkin, incognito, no place here for titles. Take it and let it stay in your memory forever. Klara! What is going on? Fate conspires against us. We may lose everything. - Careful. - He's been bribed. The Widow is in my house. Father wants me - to marry her. - God forbid! His influence upon her - is shameless. - I have no advice to give. My uncle is so impetuous! He thinks I'm an emissary. - Not any more. - You've betrayed me? Well, I told him. - Scoundrel! - My dear, - you're upsetting me. - Let me punish him! - You'll be the death of me yet. - I am not frightened, - I'm as good as dead. - What is he saying? Nonsense! Go on, don't lose a moment. Yes, run away. The Cupbearer's men are waiting to grab and tie you. - He'll imprison you. - Isn't that enough for you? - What about us? - I'll write. - This evening. - I hear a noise... - What I meant... - Later! I go now, but I'll be back... My dear, dear sir, I've trapped you like a bear. What could you possibly do to me? There're lots of you, but I'm not afraid. If you are a brigand then you have me, but if you are a man of honor let's duel. I will not die! I like your spirit, but we've other business. Listen to me. The Notary stole my fiance and wants her to marry you, but I'll not let him triumph. I have my plans. You can either go to prison... where they won't find you or give your hand to Klara. So for you, a lovely young bride, for the widow an old maid's dream, for the Notary a thumping - and revenge for me. All will be settled. - But... - There are no buts. - Just a moment... - Now or never! - Shall I believe him? - We should. - Shall we marry today? - Sure! So we'll marry. Then give her your hand. The priest is waiting in the chapel. Hurry! The Notary is finished! Oh, good evening. Has the plague struck? Nobody to tell me if the master's home. I am at your service. Interesting. He summoned me to a duel and I agreed. May God's will be done. One must always accept fate. So, I waited there, ready to pick up the sabre, but my challenger did not appear. Please, dear Notary. Don't duel with him, he'll cut you to shreds. True as God in heaven. Hooray! Long live the bride and groom! - Who is getting married? - Your son. Impossible! Hurry up, Smigalski! Saddle my horse! It's already after four! Dear God, do not lead me into temptation. He came into my house, so I cannot harm him. - What do you want? - My son! Gladly. You'll be happy. But with or without his wife? This is too much... What is too much? You stole my fiance to make her your daughter-in-law. In turn I took your son and married him off. There you go: Tit for tat. Oh, my father! Oh, uncle. - Let's end all this confusion. - Please forgive us father... and bless our love. Get up darling, and come with me. Am I to believe what is happening? - Waclaw and Klara? - I'm going crazy. Since it has happened, I must believe it. Let me explain everything to you. I wanted to get married to escape the life of a beggar. The fortune I had was never for me. Today it falls to Klara forever. Two fortunes - quite a nest-egg! Yet her uncle looks chagrined. You can't always win. But I still don't lose, with 100,000 from the Notary. No... I will pay. Please do not resist any longer. Leave your anger behind and give us your blessings. May God's will be done. One must always accept fate. Can I trust you? Will they hurt me? I call upon your lordship to strike up the music and fill the goblets! We'll drink to the newlyweds. May our houses join just as these couples have done. My dear, dear sir... Peace between us? Peace! Yes, peace and may God bless us. Oh fortune, this is too much for me. A poisoning and a wedding, all in one day! The sun will stand still and the seas will dry up before there'll be peace between us. May God's will be done. One must always accept fate. I have wasted no time in thought, for I prefer to act fast. What is wrong with my "B"? What does it lack? He who accomplishes these tasks will lead me to the altar. That one I'll marry. Both sides should give a little. Forgive, and there will be peace again. Translation: Christopher Caes Subtitles and positioning: Marcin Lesniewski Print-out: Laser Film Text (Warsaw, Poland)
