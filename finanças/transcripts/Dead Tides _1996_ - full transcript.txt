- In life, there'’s only two things i'’ve found that ever meant anything to me: The power of the wind and the vastness of the sea. - I'’ll see you up there. - Yeah, okay. - Hi, Nola. - Hey, handsome. - How'’d it go? - It went fine. I'’m gonna go clean up. - Let me do that. How'’d it go, baby? - I told you, it was no trouble. - You sure? - It went very easy. - Nola, turn around. - What? - I missed you, baby. Did you miss me? Hmm? Don'’t hesitate, Nola. - Yes. I'’m just really tired. That'’s it. I-- I had a long day in the sun. - Tired. I am so sorry that I put you up to these trips. I wouldn'’t put you in harm'’s way. - Yeah, I know that. - You believe that, right? - Sure. - So are you all done? - Yeah. I got it handled. - Good. We need to talk. - Man, what'’s up? - We have a slight problem. - Oh, yeah, what'’s that? What the hell is this? Hey, look, I want to talk to Nola. - So do I. - Nola! - What a shame. We'’ll play a little game. If you get away, you live. If you Don'’t, you die. Easy. You got to do better than that. That was too easy. - Fuck you. - Now get up. Go! Go! Go! - Get up, man. - Senor, we got him. - Good. Hold him still! - Juan, please. - Please what, Nola? Hold him still! Yes. I love technology. - What did he do, Juan? - He was stealing from US. He betrayed my trust. For better or worse, Nola, I trust you and you trust me. You understand that? Anyways, I got a new plan. You get to go home. - L.A.? - Mm-hmm. You can go shopping. But you have to get US a new captain. - Another one? - I have it all set up. - Who? - I thought of robbing you blind. Of course, there'’s nothing to steal. - Really? - So how'’d it go? - Eh. It was nice. - How was Hawaii? - Incredible. - I'’m pissed that you left. - Really? So what else is new? Here, help me with this. - I mean, you said that you were going for one week, and you were gone for two months. - Has it been that long? - Mm-hmm. I missed you. Did you miss me? - Lori, you'’re confusing me. If I recall, when I left, you told me you were finished with me. - All right, before we start fighting, I brought something for you. - What'’s this? - Dinner. - You do the dishes. - Mm-mm. - Come on. - No way. It'’s damn romantic. Delicious meal, gorgeous setting, okay company. - Hey. Hey, Scott, we were just having a bite. Come on up. - Thanks. - What'’s up? - We need to talk, Lori. - I Don'’t need to be in the middle here. - Oh, no, no, no, you'’re not. - Yes, he is. - Scott, I think you should leave. - Could we just tone things down a notch? - Fuck you, Mick. - Come on, man, that'’s not called for. - You leave, she runs to me. You come back, she runs back to you. You are in the way. - You'’re way out of line here. - You two are over. Step aside, and stop stirring it up. Let'’s go. - Please slow down. This is not a battle, huh? - That'’s right. You see, I love this woman, and this woman loves me. It'’s black and white. Our feelings are very clear to US, Mick. - Uh, if it'’s so black and white, what'’s she doing here? - Oh, Mick, i'’m sorry. - It'’s okay. Don'’t worry about it. - Scott, what the hell do you think you'’re doing? - Ah! - Ah! - You okay? - Yeah. - Good. - I think so. How about you? - I'’m fine. - He'’s a little hotheaded. - Yeah, I can see that. Hey, listen, dinner was great. - So you liked it? - Oh, yeah. - Good. - Especially dessert. What was that, hurricane Scott? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hurricane Scott. Oh, no. Come back. - Let'’s get out of here. - Let'’s get. - Come on, let'’s go. Come on, let'’s go. Freeze! D.e.a.! You up there! Shut the fuck up. Let me see your hands! Get that hand up! - He'’s got a gun! Ah, watch out! Watch out! - Get out, get out, get out! Put those guns down! - Come on. Get back, man. - Oh, man. Dead. - Son of a bitch. - Well, that'’s Juan Carlos for you. There'’s nothing he won'’t do for money. - I want him dead. - Well, he hasn'’t been coming in by air. Not for the last two months. - He'’s coming in on the water. - Can I get you something? - Get me a double Jack on the rocks, will you? - Okay. - Anything? - I got a couple of leads i'’m following up on. I got word that Carlos is working on some new shipments. He might be using his wife. - I love women. - Yeah, Mick, okay. Whatever you say. - I believe in zorba, man. Every woman needs love. Lots of love. - Thanks. - What the hell are you doing here? - Working. I started last week. - Terrific, Lori. You can'’t work here. This is my hangout. Come on, you'’re ruining my life. - You got something to hide? - Yeah, you'’re damn right I do. - You need another beer or what? - Make it a six-pack, would you? - You'’ve got it. - Hello, Mick. - You know, you really did a number on my place the other night. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Actually i'’m not even finished yet. - Where is this macho shit coming from? You know, it'’s really getting annoying. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, you dumped on the marines and you dumped on the guard. I Don'’t need you dumping on me and mine. I'’m asking you, Mick-- no, I am telling you, stay away from Lori and me. - Tell me something. If she'’s not with me, who do you suppose she'’s running around with? - You son of a-- - why Don'’t you guys go get some air? - It'’s okay. I was just leaving. - Yeah. - Excuse me. - Mick. Mick! What? What now, huh? - He'’s not into you, Lori. - Do me a favor, Scott. Just stay away. - That'’s not what your eyes say. Marry me. - What? - Marry me, Lori. - Scott, damn, i'’m working. I'’m working. Mick, can I come in? - Come on, Lori. - What? Should I leave? - It'’d be better for both of US. - Could you give me just a little bit more to do on? - Well, that'’s exactly what I Don'’t want to do. - Why not? Because of Scott? - I Don'’t know. - I still care about you. - What about Scott? - I guess I care about him too. - Oh, that'’s gonna work great. - Mick, you can'’t stay out there forever. - Why not? Me faking a change is not gonna make US a reality. - You'’re right. I'’m sorry. What is it about you that drives me so crazy? - That'’s the wife. - Now where is she going? - Oh, shit. They'’ll go away. - You think? - Yeah. Oh, come on. - Yes? - Good morning. Is this where Mr. Mick leedy lives? - Mick leddy. Yes, he does. - Leddy. Leedy. Is he home? - Yes, i'’m sorry. Come in. Mick! There'’s someone to see you. Honey? - Mr. Leddy? - Yeah. What can I do for you? - Well, I actually need a pilot. I need to get down to Mexico, and i'’m looking for a pilot to sail my boat. - What kind of boat is it? - I just told you it'’s a sailboat. - Okay. How long is it? - You'’re the expert. - Fair enough. - I need to get to Guadalupe. I have some friends that are thinking about buying my boat, and they want to see it before they do, so we have a couple of days to get down there. - Is it in good shape? Oh, I know. I'’m the expert. - I'’m also willing to give you $2,000 a week if that'’s acceptable. - Well, I think I can work that into my schedule. - Good. Then I will see you at the marlago Marina around 5:00. Sloop 38. - Okay. - And you can check out the boat then. - Great. I'’ll see you tomorrow. - Good. - What a bitch. - Yeah. - Mick. - Yeah? - Scott'’s asked me to marry him. - Really? - Tell me i'’m crazy, but I've actually thought twice about it. - You have? You'’re crazy. - Wrong answer. - Women. - Hello. Come aboard. - Looks great. - Well, I only travel first class, Mr. Leddy. - Please. Mick. - As you like, Mick. Shall we start? The boat was built in 1926. I had it renovated in 1990. It'’s a racing schooner. Sleeps about 10. - It'’s very nice. - Thank you. - It'’s pretty sophisticated gear you got. Just like a coast guard ship. - How would you know? - I was there a couple years. - Great. Well, do you have any questions? - No, everything seems in order. Except what time do you want to shove off? - I'’d like to leave around 6:00 A.M. That'’ll get US into Guadalupe the next day. - With the right wind, that ought to be about right. - Good, because Juan'’s expecting US then. - Juan? - Juan Carlos, my husband. - Great. - Great. - I'’ll see you then. You have a good day. - It'’s all set. We'’ll be leaving around 6:00 A.M. No, not a thing. Are you kidding? He'’ll be just fine. Well, gracias, cama Mia. Ciao. Hey. Almost ready? - Yep. Just be a few minutes. - All right, guys. Everything is fine. You can go now. Thank you. Thanks. - They'’re not coming? - No. Is there a problem? - Well, I just thought i'’d have some crew. - Well, if you need any help, you can always ask me. - Well, it'’s not a small boat. - Too much for you? Good. Is everything okay? - It'’s beautiful. - Hey, will you do me a favor? Put some of that on me? Mmm. You have a nice touch. - There, how'’s that? Well, we have a strong current going, huh? - Are you married? - No. - Mm, why not? - Just haven'’t been able to lock that in. - Well, you'’re a very attractive man. - Well, thank you. - You'’re welcome. Are we on schedule? - Oh, right. I guess I better get back and check. - Hey. You did an excellent, excellent job. Thank you so much. - My pleasure. - I'’m sure Juan would really like to meet you. Why Don'’t you come on in for dinner? - Oh, no, I got some stuff. - Oh, come on. Come on, it'’ll be great. Hello. - Hi, baby. - I'’d like you to meet Mick. He is the captain of the boat. - It'’s a nice boat you have, sir. - Nice boat. You screw my wife? - Oh, please. - Excuse me? - Don'’t do it. She'’s the black widow, you know. If you did it, Mick, i'’ll cut your balls off with a rusty knife. Wholly enjoy it. Am I scaring you? - No. - Good. You look like the type of man that'’s got a lot of women in the states. - I know a few ladies in the states. - Introduce me to one. I'’ll swap for Nola. - Oh, Juan, please, the guy just met you. He doesn'’t know if you'’re joking or not. - We'’re going out tonight to a festival. Would you like to join US? Come on, then. Why not? - It'’s a wild party. - That'’s him. Stay cool, all right? - Have a seat, my dear. - Thank you. - You'’re welcome. Sorry about the body guards, but these peasants, you know? They get resentful and jealous '’cause I'm such a wealthy man. - I can understand that. - May I have my lipstick, please? - There you go, baby. - I will be right back. - She'’s beautiful isn't she? - Salud. - She ran away from home when she was 14. Her father was working in Mexico City. When I found her in the streets, she was fucking for food. - Really? - Mm. I would have gotten rid of her a long time ago, but she'’s so damn beautiful, you know, Mick? Fight like two wild bulls. I'’ve got to give her this-- she knows her way around men. Don'’t you, baby, know your way around men? - You know, you can be so crude at times. Do not listen to him. On top of everything else, he is a compulsive liar. I'’m sure he told you the one about the runaway street whore? Yeah. - No. What are you talking about? - I worked for one of his companies as a secretary back in the states after I finished the university. That'’s how we met. - Oh, yeah. I forgot that. Baby, i'’m sorry. - Want to dance? - Oh, i'’m-- - go ahead. - Ballerina. - Tell Maria and juana I want to see them. - I'’m sorry. - About what? - About Juan. - Oh, Nola, look, you hired me to pilot your boat. I Don'’t want to get between you and your husband. - Mm. I like that. I like you too. Don'’t be afraid of him. He looks a little preoccupied. - Get up. I said get up. - Fat fuck, you think you'’re invisible? Get out of my sight. Come on. Keep the music playing. Okay, play. Dance. Drink. This is your room. - Ah, good. - I'’m sorry about that incident. - Oh, that'’s okay. You'’re a very brave man. - I'’m not a brave man. I'’m a stupid man. Mick. - Yeah. - Do you want a woman tonight? - No, thanks. - I'’ve got a few that will give you the best fucks like that. - I appreciate it, but not tonight. - A man of integrity. - No, just a little tired. - I understand that. Just tired. - Thanks for the evening. - Good night. - Good night. She'’s riding a little low on the water. - Well, that'’s because I have 20 kilos of the finest drugs onboard. I'’m only playing, Mick. Look, I have 25 crates of exotic fruits, gifts for some of my best friends in the usa, so Don'’t let anyone stop you. - Okay, no problem. - Take good care of my lady. - I will. - I promise you that the next time, i'’ll go. - Mm-hmm. I'’ve heard this before. - Please give me a kiss. Take care, okay? - Yeah. You too. I'’m gonna lay out for a little bit, so Don'’t let me burn, okay? - Sure. - Maybe you can rub some oil on me later. - All right. - Excuse me. It'’s a little hot out there, and I just need to freshen up a bit, you know? Look, you are here to take me somewhere, and that'’s it. - Okay, but I know when someone'’s coming on to me. - Oh, you do, do you? Well, you were wrong. - Am I? - Dead wrong. - Speed up. Vessel, this is u.S. Customs. Prepare to be boarded. - Aw, shit. - Ma'’am, are you the owner of this vessel? - Yes, I am. Why, is there a problem? - We radioed and called out. We heard nothing. Were you below? - For a moment. - Routine search, ma'’am. You got a passport? You'’re in u.S. Waters now. That'’s the marker there. - Well, i'’m an American. - Passport or I.D., please. You have anything you want to declare? - Why should I? I have nothing on... - You son of a bitch. - You get her to dog me, and then you'’re out here doing this. Oh, bastard. - Ah! - Will somebody please do something for him? - Sir, that can'’t stand. - Bullshit, haim. - Sir. - He came for me, right? - Pull him in. - What do you have aboard this ship? - There'’s nothing. - Check below. Why didn'’t you declare this? - What? What? Declare what? - Why didn'’t you declare this? - I forgot. - It'’s all right, ma'am. - Haim, you'’ve crossed me once today. Don'’t push your luck. Confiscate it. - Oh, come on. They'’re just-- - no. Throw it overboard. - Go ahead. You got it. - Get that one. - You still upset? - No. - I can stop by tomorrow and pay you. - That'’ll be fine. - Mick! - Also, I would like to discuss maybe another trip going back. - Thanks. - Hey. - How you doing? - Good. - I ran into our friend Scott. - He is acting so crazy. - The boat'’s got to be loaded. - We wait. - We could take this one. - We wait. - We wait. - Hey, Lori. Oh, i'’m sorry. Please come on in. You'’re early. - Yeah. - Thank you very much. - Good. I need you to bring the boat down south again. A little further this time for Juan. It'’s only for a couple of days, and I can pay you more. - Well, i-- - I need to leave around 2:00. If you go, do you think your coast guard friends will be there? - Nola, I think I can avoid them this time. - Good. Because I hate to see you get hurt. - Mick? - Yeah. - Where were you? - Sorry, I was lying down. - I thought i'’d cut on out early and come on over. Bring some steaks and maybe have a barbeque. - I Don'’t know. I got another charter. - You'’re falling for her, aren'’t you? - What are you talking about? It'’s just a job. - Cut the bullshit, Mick. Are you in love with her? - There'’s no way. - Sure. Thanks. - Thanks for coming. - No problem. - Have a seat over here. - Whether you know it or not, we'’re trying to bust a middleman who'’s bringing in a lot of south American business. - Yeah? - We'’ve been pretty successful at stopping his air operation. We believe he'’s moved to the water. - He'’s using u.S. Captains on slick sailboats. He'’s moving $20 million, $30 million worth of goods at a pop. I'’ll get right to it. We think he'’s using your old buddy Mick leddy to move his merchandise. - This is unreal. You got to be kidding me. - No, i'’m not. What we need is somebody on his inside track. - Whatever you need. - I was obsessed with thoughts of Nola. Maybe the wind and the sea were playing strange tricks... Or maybe I was really falling in love with her. I wanted to believe she felt the same way... But I knew Juan would kill both of US before giving her up. - Mmm. I just love it here. Castanega. It is so beautiful. Hey, Mick. - Oh, hey, just doing an engine check before we shove off. - Is everything all right? - Sure. Just give me a couple minutes. - Okay. Are you all right? - Yeah. Everything'’s working perfect. - Okay. - Thanks. - Hi. You okay? You sure? - Yes, i'’m sure. - Good, because you know everything'’s gonna be fine. What can we do? - Damn. They'’re way off their sweep patterns. I thought we were okay. Against 5,000 horsepower, radar, and sonar? - Sir, we have the sailboat in sight off our bow. - Officer, do not pursue. Stay back. Do you read me? - Turn that thing off. Prepare for boat to boat. Get the dinghy ready. - He boarded the sailboat, sir. - He did what? - They'’re on the sailboat. - I told that son of a bitch to stay back. - Oh, my god. - Another pleasant surprise. How you doing, ma'’am? And the captain? We got a little carried away the other day. Let'’s be professionals. It'’s just a routine inspection. You weren'’t trying to outrun me back there, were you? - No, I was just trying to make up for a little lost time. - And what'’s the hurry? - There is no hurry. - Okay. I understand. Did you know this sailboat has been up and down the coast 15 times in the last three months? - What'’s that got to do with me? - I Don'’t know. She'’s also had four different captains. Did you know that? - No, I didn'’t. - 6236 Perkins. Nice. What do you have hidden in the hold, Mick? - I got nothing. - Really? - Yeah, it'’s all sealed up on this model. - Well, maybe i'’ll take your word for it, but maybe i'’ll take it ashore and rip her apart anyway. - You are not doing that to my boat. - That'’s not your call, ma'am. - Oh, come on, Scott, jeez. - We'’re getting an emergency call on the com 4, sir. - Well, maybe not today. Let'’s go. - Why so many captains? - They had other work. It'’s not what you think. You still upset? - No. - Well, I might have to go back. - Well, I have another charter scheduled. - Do you, or are you just saying you do? - No, really, I do. - I see. I feel like something'’s ended, and i'’m really sad about it. - I just have to do this charter. That'’s all. - Can we see each other again? - Of course. Thanks for the ride. - You'’re welcome. - I'’ll see you. - Mr. Leddy, we'’re with the d.E.A. Would you come with US? - What'’s this all about? - We'’d like to ask you a few questions. Would you come with US? - All right. - Lori. Mick is in bad. Drug running. - What? That'’s impossible. - Uh-uh. Very possible. - Are you involved in this? - Don'’t blame me, Lori. This has nothing to do with me. - You did this. - This is d.E.A. All on their own. - You'’ve got to help him. - Me? - He'’s being set up for a fall. You'’ve got to get him out, Scott. - No. No way. No way. - You'’ve got to give to get. You can'’t just go bullying your way through life. One of these days, your ass is gonna be on the line, and you'’re gonna be standing around looking for friends. These d.E.A. Guys-- they Don'’t care about US. They'’re just looking for trophies. - I'’m not getting in the middle of this. - Scott, you want me to love you? You got to help your friends, and whether you like it or not, Mick is your friend. - Hello, Mick. How are you? Have a seat. So tell US about it. - About what? - Word has it that you'’re dirty. Tell US about the drugs. - I just charter boats. I'’m not into drugs. - Navy seal. Seven commendations. Quits. Coast guard. Highly rated. Quits. What'’s the problem? - I just got tired of taking orders. - There'’s an old coast guard buddy of yours who says you run drugs. - Scott? Scott'’s got it in for me. You can ask anybody. - Oh, we have. It'’s a split decision. Most people around here like you. Most Don'’t want you around their women. - Oh, this is ridiculous. I got nothing to do with drugs. - Now, you know Nola? Smart lady. Course, I think you'’re lucky you still got your balls. She'’s as cold as they come. - I just piloted the boat a couple times down to Mexico. Both times, the coast guard stopped US. They found nothing. - But we know how incompetent the coast guard can be. That'’s why we're here. Now, we assume that Nola is working with her husband, Juan Carlos, and we want them both. Mick, you can either work with US, or you can go down alone. I Don'’t give a shit. - I told you I didn'’t do anything wrong. - Mick, it'’s over. I want you to get Juan Carlos in receipt of goods or cash in Guadalupe when the Mexican officials take him out. Then, i'’ll think about negotiating with you. - This is bullshit. I didn'’t do anything wrong. - That'’s what every judge and jury always hears, isn'’t it? Now, what'’s gonna make your story more unique? Believable? - Alls I got is the truth. - That doesn'’t get you very far these days. Now, it'’s your choice. We want you to wear a wire. This is a transponder so we can chart all your movements. We'’ll know where you are all the time. And a camera. We want pictures. Lots of them. - This is suicide. - You'’re still here? I thought you were arrested. What'’s going on, Mick? - Lori, i'’m really out of it. Just let me call you tomorrow. - They let you go? - Hardly. - What? - They want me to go in wired. They want me to take those drug dealers down. - That'’s crazy. - It'’ll be all right. I can take care of myself. - That'’s not it, is it? You'’re doing this for her, aren'’t you? - Oh, that'’s ridiculous. I'’m doing this to get myself off the hook. They Don'’t care if they bring me down. They Don'’t care what they do to me. Lori, I can'’t sit in a cell. I can'’t even sit through a trial. I'’ll go insane. I'’ll die. - Yeah, I know that. - You'’re a good friend. Nola. - Mick. Oh, hi. I thought you were gone for good. - No, but my charter fell through. You Don'’t need a pilot, do you? - Very much. I was having difficulty trying to get back. Can we leave tomorrow morning? - Sure, I guess we can do that. - Is something wrong? - No. No, no. What time? - I guess 8:00. I could come pick you up. - Good. I'’ll see you then. - Great. Terrific. - So are you gonna leave Juan? - Of course. Actually, after this trip, i'’m gonna end it. Then we can just disappear. Well, this is our boat today. - What? This is our boat? - What, you have a problem with that? There'’s a lot of room downstairs. - They'’re out to sea. - We got them on radar. - So is this yours too? - It'’s Juan's. He collects boats and women. - And money. You can'’t buy either one without money. - You know, in a really strange way, Juan was a really good man for me. - You could have any man. - He married me when I was 17. - So was it true? Were you a hooker in Mexico City? - Of course not. You know, this is the first time in my life that I feel good about myself. I'’m not a boat. I'’m not a car. I'’m not a thing. - That'’s nice. - Take the shirt off. Do it! - So you love me, but you'’d kill me. - I'’ll do it if I have to. - Well. - Fucking shit! - You'’re quite the actress. That is some role you play. - Sure. Sure, why Don'’t we talk about roles, huh? You would have done anything to take me under to save your own ass, so who'’s using who? - "Who'’s using who." I was just stupid enough to fall in love with you. - Bullshit. You were out for whatever you could get from the very beginning. A little piece of ass. Tequila money. - You'’re not gonna shoot me. So you think Juan'’s gonna be there at the end of the day for you? - Juan and I are just the same. We know exactly who we are. - So where does it go from here? Bigger houses? Bigger boats? - Oh, shut up. I could kill you right here. It'’d be easy to do. - The feds and the Mexican authorities are all over this. You know, we could still make it out of here. - We? I can'’t believe you're stupid enough to use that word. No one is going to do anything in Mexico to Juan and I. - So it was all a lie? - Damn it. They said what? Son of a bitch. - All right. He'’s all yours. - Adams, get me on the water. I want fucking Carlos dead. - We can'’t go into Mexican waters. - Just do it. Get some choppers up too. - I found a wire on him. I threw it into the ocean. - We'’re gonna have to move for a while. - I thought we already had this taken care of. - Conitas is getting pressure. It'’s okay, though. We just have to find a new angle. - This is really pissing me off. I did everything to make sure he got elected. I Don'’t even want to hear this shit. - It'’s gonna be okay, Nola. What about the pilot? - Left him on the boat. - Why? - Thought we might need a hostage. - Good idea. - Vamanos. - Come on. - Easy. - What'’s that? - It'’s okay. - Juan? - Baby, he'’s over. We Don'’t need no hostages. You mustn'’t allow yourself to get so close ever again. It'’s finished. - Senor! Senor, he got away. - Find him! - Get this tub moving. - You got it. - Not you. I need someone capable of following orders. You the second? - I am, sir. - Then you'’re gonna handle it on this trip. You'’re staying ashore. - You cannot give those kinds of commands aboard my ship. - I can'’t? Well, I just did. - We agreed to cooperate with d.E.A. On patrols only. We do not take commands from d.E.A.! - Is that so? Adams, arrest this man for obstruction of justice. Does anyone here know how to run this rust bucket? Gentlemen, I Don'’t give a shit if you want to help me or not, but it will be on your record, and I will arrest you. - Yes, sir. - Well, let'’s do it then. - Did they all fuck your wife? - Maybe they did, Mick, but i'’m gonna blow your fucking balls off. - Please report. What do you guys see up there? - The boats are flying up the coast, sir. Looks like one is firing on the other. - Get me a man on that gun. Are we still in u.S. Waters? - We'’re right on the border, sir. - This is u.S. Customs. Cut your engines immediately. Fire a warning shot. - Get down. - No! - Take him out. - Oh! - Nola! - Give me that.
