When King Gyeongjong died in the fourth year of his reign and Yeongjo was crowned, some of Soron and Namin (political factions) who were excluded from the government revolted to remove King Yeongjo and the Noron (another political faction). Yi In-jwa became the commander-in-chief and led the rebellion. The rebels occupied Cheongju, Chungcheong-do, and began to march north. However, the rebellion, which involved as many as 20,000 people was defeated by the royal forces in Anseong and Juksan, and the rebellion was suppressed. And Commander-in-chief Yi In-jwa was imprisoned. However, 5 members of Eo-Yeong-Cheong, the best warrior group of Joseon who supported Yi In-jwa, assembled the remaining forces and established a new plan. 6 months ago Here we are. How large is this place? It's about 4 square km. Before His Majesty returns to the royal palace, we should go through this place. Halt! His Majesty will pass this way. Not even an ant should be allowed in. - Search Everywhere! - Yes, sir! Who are you? Where are you from? We're merchants from Cheongju. THE AGE OF BLOOD 1728, 4th year of Yeongjo's reign Let me go! Let me go first and talk. Why are you holding me so tightly? Let me go! You're so cheap and nasty. I'm done! I'll never do it! Hey, you scared me. That's a load of bullshit. You're completely insane! I gave you a spear, a blade, a sword, a bow, etc. If each one is worth one nyang, it should be twelve nyang! How could you give me just five nyang? Hey, look! These are the used ones. They are all crappy! The string of the horn bow looks like a droopy cock of a dog. And what is this? It's a crappy sword used by a Royal Guard minion. Minion? It may not look like it, but it's an excellent sword that caught the villains of the military officials' uprising. That's absurd. Just take them. Eleven nyang! Seven. Ten! Except this. You said it's a crappy sword used by Royal guard's minion. Dong-seok. Hey! I didn't want to come here too. I'm making an effort to get you. Then don't come here! You're so rude. I came here for you, even though I was busy. - You should thank me! - You're not busy! - You're a bum who were kicked out of the royal palace! - What? When you became an officer, I bragged so much about it. How embarrassing! He has a nasty temper. Wait, Dong-seok! Let me give you a little one, because you're little. What the heck? Let me have a big one, because I'm big. - Grandpa. - Huh? You son of a bitch! - Hey, why did you hit me? - How long will you be a bum? Don't ever call me that! Am I the only bum in the entire country? Hey, man. You're a young man who has no physical defects. You should do something! Do something, man! Please! When did I ask for money or food? Frankly speaking, we're not that close. Your dead daughter, Kkot-bun, I liked her for a while. That's all. Hey, you son of a bitch! I said, don't mention Kkot-bun in front of Dong-seok! Damn it! You're as strong as Hercules, you old man. Anywa, I'm no longer involved with you. We have nothing to do with each other! Okay. What? "We hereby appoint Kim Ho, the former Royal Guard officer as a prison guard. Be faithful to your...duty!" A prison guard for the Uigeumbu ( Royal Investigation Bureau)? A prison guard? You got on your high horse when you were a captain. Then, now what, a prison guard? How can you disgrace your dead father's name? Oh my! Why are you talking about my father again? It's not fair to appoint me as a prison guard! I won't do it! Never! He's killing me! When I said it nicely, you should have opened the door. Oh my! A son of a bitch is killing me! What? A son of a bitch? You swine! Don't you know me? It's me, Kim Ho. An officer of the Royal Guard. What, Royal guard officer? That's a story from ages ago. You swine! Are you still easily going to fist fighting? I'm at a loss for words. That's going too far! I deserve at least Minor official or Captain But you appointed me as a prison guard. A prison guard. What, don't you like it? Then, do you want a job at the stable of Sabokshi? - Uncle! - What! How dare you speak that way to him? Even if you're his nephew. Uncle, you're a general. I know you're better than this. There's no reason to play this kind of joke. Who is it? Who sent me to Royal Investigation Bureau? Stop it! Although I overindulged you on my dead brother's account, you're going too far! Leave now before you're flogged. Damn it. I've totally lost my face. Try this. Don't flatter yourself! I mean, I'll resume my seat as a Royal Guard soon. Royal Guard? Are you laughing now? Then what, do I need to cry? In the less than a year that you worked for the Royal Guard, you were demoted to minor officer. In less than a half month, you were a guard at the gate. After all, now you're a prison guard! I have nothing to say. What the heck! I didn't explain everything to you. But there were complicated circumstances. Enough of your nonsense. Here it is. What is it? It's a charm that makes your guard life easier. Keep it. You must be very grateful for this guard job. Well... What? Hey, look carefully. There's no prison guard carrying a sword. Here it is. This is your sword from now on. Why are you here again? Do I need to be home alone? - Get out! - Oh boy! This is the Royal Investigation Bureau, not a public place. Gwanghamun (Gwanghwa Gate) 6:00 p.m. We got a message. We need to get this done tonight! Brace yourself! Let's go. Byeoljang Prison at Uigeumbu Is that you? Cute. What are you doing now? Oh my, it's a lot of money for your hazing. We can go on a binge for a long time. I said, what are you doing? How dare you speak that way to me? How dare you hold your head so high? You little bastard Let me go! Ho, what are you doing now? Get off me! Why don't you go to relieve your thirst? What a lucky bastard! You'll have to pay for this later. Why couldn't you let it slide at least once? Roll call! I mean, call the roll! You're only a prison guard. This is too much. You die! Damn it. Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! You'll be executed at the crack of dawn. Tell me what you want before you die. I'm thirsty. Please give me some water. Drink the water to your heart's content. 3 footsteps. What? With 3 footsteps, I can take the sword from you and cut your throat. Hey! Put that sword down. Then I'll overlook this. Don't say something if you don't mean it. Even though you're a master swordsman, you won't be able to handle all of us. Shall we confirm that? 2 hour sandglass. 8:00 p.m. I'm not a traitor. Yes. You're not a traitor. Then... Do you admit your crime that you didn't protect your king? That is... acknowledged. That's why you're a traitor! Ho! Who is it? You jerk! It's me, Hwang Jin-gi. What? Don't you know me? Mt. Jiri is famous for good mountains and water. I'm leading the gang of robbers who settled in Nogodan Peak. Hwang Jin-gi. You know me. But I don't. Never mind. We exchanged greetings, so you're my acquaintance now. You're crazy. I'll make you rich. You must live from hand to mouth on the guard's paycheck. I can make you live idle with beautiful women until you're old and gray. If you get me out of here. Yeah? If you don't want to be beaten until you're old and gray, just shut up and stay still. Got it? You son of a bitch! Run away. Run away as far as possible. Let everything go and don't ever look back. If you can't get away, fight to the death. You must die to survive. Uigeumbu (Royal Investigation Bureau) Who's there? You must die to survive. Damn, this drives me crazy. The enemy destroys the palace. Kill them all! What's happening? There's no prison guard carrying a sword. This is your sword from now on. Damn it. You scared me! What's up? He looks like a guard. Why is a guard there? Hey, why are you here? You're wasting time. Take care of him now! Don't shoot, no! Damn it. Who's there? We don't need to exchange names. Make sure to kill everyone here. Without exception. Who's there? What do you think it is? I'm a prison guard. What are you doing there? That's none of your business. In the middle of the night, you jumped over a wall of Uigeumbu prison. Things are really shitty! As a government employee, I can't let you go, because you must be traitors. Right? You're insane. You bastard! Close the door. You must be having a tough time. 'He poisoned his brother. (Translator's Note -There was a rumor that Yeongjo poisoned his brother King Gyeongjong) His mother was a humble maid.' ( Yeongjo's mother was a royal concubine) There are many ministers gossiping behind the king's back. I know it too. These days, the rumor says they're plotting to commit treason. No! That's an absurd rumor! Treason? That's utterly unreasonable. With your support, the king will definitely govern wisely. Sure, your majesty. Don't worry. I'll assist his majesty in my faith. Did you hear him? He'd assist him in his faith at this belated time. Vice Minister Did you receive orders from the Queen Dowager? She ordered me to put you to rest. As I expected, the Queen Dowager also ... They moved in large groups. Damn it. What do you think you are doing now? What do you think? I'm quite good, even I'm a guard. Ju-shik. Hey, stop! Who are you? Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me? Dong-seok. Dong-seok. Damn it. I thought I saw them somewhere before. Five members of Eo-Yung-Chung! Captain of Eo-Yung-Chung and master of the iron mace, Choi Jung-gu. The master of the spear, Yoon Ju-shik. The master of the horn bow, Kim Seong-shik. The master of the short bow, Yoo Il-woon. And...The supreme master of Eo-Yung-Chung, Commander Do Man-cheol! You screwed with the wrong guy. Uncle! Are you okay? What's happening now? Have you seen Dong-seok? Uncle, hide in a safe place. Let me look for him. Okay. Sir, we wasted time. Let's go. Where are you going? I wasn't sure, but I just remembered. You must be the 5 members of Eo-Yung-Chung! Have we met before? You look like you're not an ordinary guard. Who are you? Just thinking that I was demoted because of you makes me angry, because it was so unfair. I just remembered! The private of the Royal Guards who asked us to teach you a lesson, right? Now you remember me? The underlings of a military camp. What an asshole! Ju-shik, Jung-gu. You little rat! Dong-seok! Why are you hiding here? That's all right. Let's go. You're late. You must have had a tough time. The soldiers will come here at dawn. You'd better hurry up. We must finish it before dawn. - What about the Queen Dowager? - I made connections with her. 9:00 p.m. You son of a bitch! Join the commander. I have to play with him a little bit more. Hey! I'm standing here, right in front of you, how dare you take the prisoner? Who are you? Should I undergo hazing myself for the prisoner now? Do you know who I am? That's absurd! It's too obvious. You're guilty of high treason. Turns out that you're the leader! The rest of them...are your minions. I'm curious. Let me ask you something! What the heck will you do after getting out of here? In the middle of night, the minions of a military camp invaded Uigeumbu prison. They killed everyone including prisoners and guards and take you who are guilty of high treason. I don't understand how this happened. He used to be Royal guard officer. Royal guard officer... Let me give you a chance because of your talent. If you want to survive, run away. Run away? That's what I'm supposed to say! I said I wanted to save you! Yi In-jwa. You know who I am now? You traitors! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Get out! Please... save him. Uncle! Uncle! I told you so. You should have stopped. Run away now. Uncle! Stop! Stop! I'll kill you all. Jung-gu, kill him. Yes, sir! Uncle! Uncle! Shut up! I thought you were dead. Are you crying? Nobody was crying. What do you think? Aren't we close each other? All right. We're close each other! No big deal. Ho. Today is Dong-seok's birthday. You must survive. Uncle, no! Don't die! Wake up! Come on, wake up! Uncle, open your eyes! Wake up! Grandpa! - Uncle. - Grandpa. - Wake up! - Don't die! - Wake up! - Open your eyes! - Wake up! - Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Open your eyes, uncle! - Don't die! - Uncle! Uncle! Midnight Welcome. What about the Queen Dowager? Her majesty is waiting for you. You should be here, just in case. We've been waiting for this for years. Nobody should mess this up. Yes, sir! You must be having a tough time. (Queen Dowager's residence) I've done nothing. I was just in prison. You made it out alive from Uigeumbu, while most prisoners don't do so. Now...you revived. It's time to see the high mountain. The king poisoned the late king to take the throne. So...he doesn't deserve the throne. Since we were of one mind, I just led the revolt. Your majesty deserves the glory. You're very humble. But...Please remember this. I'm listening. I am different from the vice prime minister. Then I'm relying on your majesty. And leaving to finish it. Who's there? I'm the former Royal guard officer. Now I'm a prison guard of the Royal Investigation Bureau. Something urgent come up. I want to meet with Chief Eunuch. You knave! How can you get into the Eunuch Department? In fact... Traitor Yi In-jwa broke out of prison. Prison break? - The traitors are here already. - Follow me. I'm Kim Ho, the former Royal guard official. Sir, it's high treason. Traitor YI In-jwa broke out of prison and already snuck into the palace. We are ready. Would you like a cup of tea? Even if everyone turned their backs, you should protect the king at the risk of your life. When did we choose a king to serve? No matter who is the king, we should serve him. After tonight, we'll have to serve another king. You traitor. But, you also served the late king before serving the current one. Which of the two kings had your loyalty? The late king? Or the current king? Only you know the answer. That's your karma too. What are you doing? The entire palace will be thrown into chaos tonight, so we were told that we should hold our breath. Who said so? His majesty did. There's no one from the Inspector General's Office, the Royal Guard, the Ministry of Defense and also the Ministry of Justice Just why did his majesty deliver the palace to the traitors? Oh my, I missed the target. You should have shot it carefully. Damn it. Hey, you must be talented. I never knew you could beat Jung-gu and Ju-shik. Why are you feeling nervous? At that rate, you'll never shoot an arrow. Damn it. I'm feeling insatiable. You're a rat in a trap. You're a dead man. Man-cheol. After you. Gangnyeongjeon (The King's Quarters) Where is the king? Where is the king? How dare you...? Stupid girl. 03.00 a.m. You're late. Where is his majesty? He knew about the plot of treason. And escaped. Half of the Royal Guard joined the traitors. The Eunuch Department, Queen Dowager, and all of the vassals are traitors. Nobody at the palace was on the side of his majesty. I know it. Was it you? Did you send me to the Royal Investigation Bureau Then...His majesty... There was no one to rely on at the Royal Guards except you. 6 months ago Hey! Relieve your thirst! Why are they refusing this drink? What happened to the leader of the traitors? Your Majesty, even though Traitor Yi In-jwa was captured, the head of Royal Guard and official Kim Ho couldn't prevent the danger in advance. They deserve to be dismissed and executed by squeezing. Do as you please. But considering their contributions, make sure they are not executed by squeezing and serve in a war as enlisted men. The ministers tried to disband the Royal Guard. His Majesty realized the treason was not over yet. So His Majesty wanted me to prepare for it. Run away. Far away. There's no place to go in this small country. Even if I went, there's no place to hide. Can you stop it? Alone? The wind can be blocked by the collar. The sky can be blocked by hands. Go. It is nearly dawn. Nobody... Nobody will survive. Do you think you'll save the court? Don't flatter yourself. When the sun rises the Joseon you knew will disappear. A new Joseon... A new sun will rise. It's 5 a.m. Why won't you answer? For some reason, the eunuchs were annihilated. And also archers from a military camp. What? Your lord. Did you ridicule His Majesty like that? You made it here. What brings you here? I can't say ... Even if I tell you, you won't understand it. In fact, I'm not sure of it too. The sword is born this way. When you cut a person first, you're scared of it endlessly. Once you can't cut a person, you'll be killed instead. Once, twice, three times, ten times, hundred times. When you cut people like that, you'll be confused whether a sword cuts a man or a man cuts a sword. I'm not that confused. You annoyed me. First. That's more than enough. Good, it's simple. Are you pulling your punches? You killed my men. Do you think I'd kill you easily? I appreciate that. When you're beaten, you'll come to your senses. Why on earth! You shouldn't have been doing this. Just because. Someone like you will never understand it. Good bye. How dare you...? That's enough. You'd better abdicate now. You don't deserve the throne. You know it better than me. I'd better abdicate? - I don't deserve it? - That's correct. Damn it! As a traitor, that's not for you to say! Hey, YI Geum. - Do you remember your father's face? - What? You must know your mother is a daughter of a grave keeper. - And your father... - Shut up! There's no reason why you should be the king of this country. Really? Then, are you saying you deserve the throne? No matter how you come from a royal family, it's not your call, you traitor! A king is made in heaven! The people and the ministers here should decide it! Ministers? The people? Where are they? Silly man! Your HIghness! How come... Shut up, you knave! You looked down upon the king. It's a capital crime! - You coward bitch! - Coward? That's not for a traitor to say. Why are you changing your minds now? Do you think the ministers of this country are all idiots? Yes. I shouldn't have trusted you. I knew it. Dump the fake one and make the real one stand up! I'll oust the fake king who poisoned the late king. Look. You'd better stop it. That's enough. The sun already came up. Do you know that clouds sometimes hide the sun? You said that's enough? When you get anything by killing innocent people, do you still think that it is justice? The sword has no power to change the world. It just cuts your enemies in front of you and only protects people you really want. The sword has no power to change the world? That's right. With the sword only. A lot of people died for a great cause. Then the swords they held for a great cause are not the swords, you mean? You... You can't be a great cause. You can't cover the eyes and the ears of people. YI Geum. - History is... - History is... the record of the winners! Thank you for your trouble. Your Majesty. The ministers are waiting for you. You'd better head toward the court. Chief Secretary. Yes, Your Majesty. In history, how can I be recorded? A bad king who poisoned his brother to take the throne? Or a good king who paid attention to people? Your Majesty. What happened last night should not be recorded in history. Not a word. Yes, Your Majesty. Do it properly. Okay, I got it. Hey, take this! Oops-a-daisy. Is it good? - Excellent! - You're not good at this. Since you haven't experienced it, you don't know how to do it. Help yourself. After all, this is the only place to give us snacks. Oh, right. I heard a revolt broke out in Seoul. - What happened next? - Where have you been? Everyone knows it, except you. What? The revolt has become in vain because of a prison guard. That makes no sense. I mean it. Who is the prison guard? His majesty is looking for you. Me? Tell him I'll never be in the palace. Why did you turn down a government position? It's the head of Royal Guards. The best sword master in this country deserves it. I don't wanted to be like Yi In-jwa. He rose in revolt. I don't know. I don't want it anymore. I just want to die in this Mt. Jiri. - Good mountains and water. - His majesty gave you a name. You'll be called Sword Wizard. Sword Wizard? Sword Wizard for a prison guard? Live a long time and you'll see everything. You look pretty in that dress. Take care! There are many thieves here. Sword Wizard! I like it! Epilogue. Although the swordsman Kim Ho was fictional, there really was a revolt led by Yi In-Jwa. (Yi In-Jwa also appears in Daebak, available at viki.) In the revolt, the Queen Dowager, really protected her stepson King Yeongjo, even though he had been falsely accused of poisoning her son, the prior king. King Yeongjo's 52 year reign is considered by historians now as one of the most brilliant of the Joseon dynasty.
