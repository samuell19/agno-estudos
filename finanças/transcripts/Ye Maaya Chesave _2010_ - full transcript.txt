Of all the girls in the world why did l fall in love with Jessie? This is Jessie So beautiful...educated... She has a style of her own... lf l took Jessie home and told my mom, ''l want to marry her'' l am sure my mom will happily agree But why did l love her? What's the problem? She is getting married... that's the problem! Can we decide whom we fall in love with? We can't go in search of love... It won't last long. lt has to happen of its own... It has spellbound us...turn our life topsy turvy! lt has to be with us always That's true love... lt happened to me... Actually l didn't choose Jessie... Love made me fall for her. This is me... My name is Karthik l finished engineering... did a few odd jobs...finally... jobless... l was in search of a well-known director to become his assistant Cinema is life... Out! l brought them all to see you make a century, you got out for duck. He bowled full toss. Only ten are here, where's the eleventh man? The money l had was just what my dad gave as pocket money... good friends...plenty of dreams ...it was such a time... Though your marks are less, but l've talked to them. You've to join the job next week. l knew the day l joined engineering, l knew l can't concentrate on it. My life is only cinema... That means? l want to join as assistant under a director Iearn the technic...direct films... l have written lots of stories, father. There are many directors waiting for my dates. l'll make you assistant to some director. Father...father... Whom do you want to work with Karthik? - Gautham Menon. Are you going to make Tamil films? No, it seems he's making a Telugu film with Mahesh Babu. Didn't Mahesh Babu find anyone else? There are many big directors in Telugu, besides, Gautham Menon takes _o years to complete a film. l knew you would come to me after getting kicked around. l have what you want, take it if you can. This is the shot, come. Fine. He's Karthik, the boy l told you... who is interested... Yeah...did engineering? He looks more like a hero... may show interest acting later. No. He'll work hard. Direction department only?- Yes sir. Not interested in acting?- No sir. ln my next film Krishna is playing a good role, Krishna will be in touch with me, you keep in touch wit him. How he came, how he became a goon... and finally how he became Billa, this is the story. Super buddy! When you narrate the story, l can see it before my eyes. Tell me, when will you start it? l'll reduce my weight. This story is ideal for Prabhas. Have you shifted to this place? House is very nice. New home will be ready in six months, we'll shift there. Did you have any tiff with upstairs people? No. Come...come. You've become a great actor. Yes, we shouldn't allow you in first. Are you supporting him? Uncle, please don't discard us so easily. l'm not here to support his cause. To narrate a story to a hero, one needs good communication skill, he has it. lf not l wouldn't support him. Just give him some time, uncle. lt was a time life was dull and dry. That's when l saw her...Jessie! Love made me fall for her. Don't go melting away my heart... My other heart will not leave you... What's this? - What's this on road? Nothing father. Nothing....for cinema... Cinema? To hell with your cinema. - Have you gone mad? Though so many beautiful girls went before me, my heart never skipped a beat... You came just a while ago and cast a spell on me... My heart is somersaulting... Hosanna (Cy of praise)! Air smells like you... Hosanna (Cy of praise)! When l see you in flowers... Whichever way you go, will it change my routine? l can't hold myself anymore... l'm giving up to breathe... l'm living in imagination... You're on earth like cloud carying colou_ul raindrops... You're unreachable like honeycomb on the tip of high branches... Won't the cloud turn into rain? Won't the branch give honey? Won't you come to me? Won't you ease my pining for you? l'm not an adversay to you, right? l'm giving up my lifespan... Living in dreams... They are Christians... Malayalee Christians. Hope you know her name? We are Naidus, hope you know that! Even if you convince Jessie her father will never accept. That's guaranty. The moment l saw her l knew you would fall for her! Don't...you will end up in big trouble. You will have to elope. Why take trouble? Put an end to it right now. Besides, her dad is a lawyer. Who told you? Did your sister Anu told you all this? Good! It's not her mistake. Your mom has brought her up that way. An old-fashioned granny in a modern attire! Don't take all that to heart! You'll end up a loser. What is it saying here? It says Jessie, right? You should only hear your heart beat. Do what it says. Don't listen to anyone. Think how you can propose to her. Focus on the next. Nothing...what's this get up? Will you do anything for money? Don't worry l'll offer you a good get up in my film. l'm asking you ignorantly, you don't think of all this? She finished her Bsc (Maths) three years ago. You finished engineering last year l calculated age, she is _o years older than you! What are you saying!? - Yes. She'll not be a day more than eighteen years. lf you want calculate. ls she is older than you by _o years?! That's awesome! This is the latest trend. She will take care of you very well She will be mom and wife rolled into one. She will make all the moves first! It's good for you also. Got it? Trust me... But what if she rejects citing this as a problem? She will! You have to stand your ground. Will you? l don't want it, mom. Mom, l'm home. Okay. Brother! How are you? - Fine. What are you doing now? Do you act in Malayalam films, uncle? You're handsome. He can't keep anything clean. His room is untidy. Karthik...can't you keep your room a little clean? Dad saw your room just now. Dad wants to talk to you in the evening. He doesn't like your obsession with cinema. Mom, l can hear a sweet voice inside, Anu has brought any friends of her home? Oh that girl! Jessie from upstairs. Oh, that girl?? Then one day...suddenly... Jessie at my place! Come in. Jessie, this is my brother... you've never met him, right? l know... your folks keep calling your name throughout the day. Can hear it upstairs. So you too know l am jobless! - l didn't mean that! You speak good Telugu. Aren't you a Malayali? Yes, but l speak better Telugu than Malayalam. How long have you been here? - Right from my birth. l like Kerala... l visit it often. Especially steam cake and chickpea curry for breakfast l always hunt for that and eat it. You get more than that in Kerala. - l know. Your village... where's your home in Kerala? Alleppey. My parents are from Alleppey. Grandmother is there. l love grandma, that's why l like Kerala. Go there once a year... For her sake. Did you do MCA after your BSc? l can never do it. Isn't Maths difficult? l like it. If you like math its very easy, that's the real secret. You did engineering? He did but waste. He just wants to become a filmmaker. He knows only that. Filmmaker. Let's see...not easy... Easier to pass Math than cinema. Films are difficult. l'll definitely become a director! My dad won't even let us watch a film! lt's considered a sin in our community! l have seen five films in my entire life. That too without my dad's knowledge. Do you want to leave Karthik? l'll take leave. She hardly watches films... my hopes got dashed. l didn't have heart to leave the room. What? l found where she works and wandered around to see her. You are not following me? You are not following me, right? This is where my office is. Kebabs are also here! l love kebabs. That's why l'm here. l asked just like that. - What? Are you saying you will buy for me too? So what do you do? l am a program analyst with Wipro. Joined _o months ago. Wait a sec! Let me just look at her. Okay, tell me, what do you have? Any Kerala items like Malabar fish curry, steamed rice.- A coconut atleast? On the way to work? No l am going to play cricket... coming? Why do you keep looking back? lf my dad sees me talking to you, l am dead meat! How old are you? l'm 24. It's okay... if my dad asks me, l'll say you're like younger brother to me. What happened? You forgot something? l don't either, l already have one... that's enough No...no...l too have a younger sister. l will accept everyone in this world as my sister here after except you! Why? Felt l had professed my love too soon. Wanted to apologise... but couldn't find her. What? Your 'love' is not here, she's in Alleppey. How do you know? l was talking to her mom. Saw you going around her house. l saw, don't do it. Waste of time, she has gone to visit her granny. Will be back after a week. Even before my sister finished talking l knew l would go to Kerala. Some guys go even to America for their love, Pleaded with Krishna to accompany me. He agreed, to sight see Kerala. Actually he took care of entire trip expenses. With what confidence did we come here? Walking endlessly all over Alleppey and Kottayam, my knees have worn out! l'm having splitting headache too. Atleast now call your sister ask her to find out from Jessie's mom more details, Find some relevant clue about their home here. Have you come with the idea of sight-seeing Kerala? l will leave in _o days, l have a film shoot. But guys like you will definitely win, you try very hard. Jessie will be yours. Buddy...get up! Get up. What's this torture in the middle of night? Not that, a small correction. Get up l say! A small correction, you said Iuck favours the brave, right? Did you wake me to say this? Both are same. Not that, get up! What's today? - Sunday. lsn't it? She's a Christian... she will definitely attend church. There are more churches than houses here, allow me to sleep. Come...come mad boy! Come, let's go.- We'll go. Will she come here? - Come quietly. Buddy, come here. How are you so sure she will come only here? ls this the only church in this place? l have checked... this is the biggest church here. Chances of her coming here is good. Hey...look... Oh! That's Jessie! Super! Is she Jessie? Super...buddy! How did you find her? l dreamed about... You are humming the wrong song. ln the film 'Bombay' Manisha Koirala is a Muslim. Your heroine is a Christian. Sing some other song. Love has only one tune. Music has only one religion. To me only Jessie! ln exactly ten seconds she will look at me! This is too much. - Just wait and watch! Let me see. Oh God! She saw! Buddy, l told you. What charm have you spread? Buddy, she saw us. - What's that? Love charm? You saw her, right? Let's go now. Come. Come l say. l was going mad. Maybe l confessed my love much too fast. l didn't find you after that l knew you would be upset. l came searching for you just to apologise. Wait... l'll introduce you as my classmate. Okay? Who is this dear? - Granny, Karthik, my classmate. Who is this young big man? You know enough Malayalam to be amused? l'm not his classmate, childhood friend. Who is this? Karthik, my classmate. Very large herd! Are you both from Hyderabad? Come home and have lunch. What is he saying? - Inviting for lunch. Lunch...lunch... Here only, show them the way. You come with them, l'll go now, dear. Come, l'll take care. Lunch? We came to say sorry, but they are inviting for lunch. They will, in the name of lunch, they will stuff you. Take care of this bald man, seems to be the main switch! Are you a Christian? l just asked simply. Many of Jessie's friends have come here before. Six months ago some ten to _enty of them came. What? Twenty guys came before us? Friends buddy! Keep quiet. Few acres of farm, coconut grove, fields, got everything here. Nothing in short. Have you come here before? He's asking if you have come here before. Jessie's classmate? Do you love mathematics that much? - Very much. Go on ...eat... What's your job? - Job? Telugu film hero. - That's okay. Eat?eat... Let's escape after having food. Keep quiet. Eat...eat... Why is biting us, buddy? There's fish curry, mutton curry, chicken curry, eat...eat... With what guts you thought you would find me? l did...didn't l? But took four days. Why did you come? - l told you... to apologise. l thought you were mad. - Yes, l am angry. l know...don't take it to heart. Don't stop talking to me for that. Okay, l won't take you and what you said seriously. That was then, l said that ten days ago, let me tell you now, ln the city where l lived for 22 years, l am not able to live for a moment without you! Why? Even he was unable to. - What did you say? Me too? Only he! That's why we came here. Love will end in failure... do you need that? However much you get a good name in my house, they will never accept a Hindu groom. We've to elope, l can't do it. My dad will not like you. - He won't even talk to me? lf you raise the topic of loving me or wanting to marry me, he'll never talk to you. There's no way he's going to like you. He will converse well otherwise, he is a good man. He will even write his entire property to you, but not his daughter. Okay, ask him to write and give. Secondly...l have lived in the same city for 24 years. l am _o years older than you! He will not accept that too. That's not a big problem nowadays. lt is very serious problem... you don't understand! Before all this l should like you... that's the toughest part! lt must happen, right? Well said. Now you are talking sense! Let's not think of love. Let's meet whenever we find time. You said friends, right? How could you come out of your house now? That's no problem here. That's why l love coming here. No one questions me here. My dad stays only for a few days and then leaves. l stay on for 10-15 days. Whenever l come here. l spent the best part of my life here only. Dad usually comes back to pick me up. First time, l am travelling back alone tomorrow in train. Location is very beautiful, l'll just go and film video. Okay, buddy. No...no...don't go... my folks will misunderstand. No, l'll come back wherever you go. Buddy, l'll try meeting Mohanlal. - Okay, carry on. Not yet become one. - Which college? Your phone number? Why do you like me? You said 'l am crazy about you'... Why? Do you think l am beautiful? ls it just with the way l look? Can't tell you all that. You'll know when you see my first film. Watch it to know. lt will be my sixth film. No...you need courage to see a girl and tell her that you love her. You need perseverance to come in search of her to another city. You'll get it only if you try... Got linked up with mind, something happened, it spread a charm, it brought me here. You speak very well. The first day l saw you. Cross my heart! The moon behind faded in its glow! My heart beat raced up. l even somersaulted on road. Do you know that? Has no one ever come after you? Guys go overboard even on average lookers. May be they haven't seen me through your eyes! Glad you understand. Then, okay. l am going to use that line in my film. Hey, it's my copyright. Good to hear all this Karthik. But don't forget we agreed to be friends. Yeah...friends... whatever l felt l told you. l have to go. Come back with me... Iet's go back together. You shook hands became friends... Iet this continue in Hyderabad. Friendship should become love that's all you want, right? Yeah, but it must happen in the train tomorrow.- Train? Oh beautiful doll! l forgot to blink my eye watching you... But still the dreams won't stop, you know? My vision is your slave... ln you...in me...deep inside something is warming... Beautiful doll!... You're the light of my heart... l can't forget you in my life... The place where you tread... Time is visual treat... It hit me like waves... You're the biggest boon to me... Like rain in moonlight, you came into my life... You've taken over me, my heart and my soul... Malayalees sing a lullaby to you in an emerald decked cradle... My Beloved! It feels so right to give you my life... You made me take bath in cold fire... You gave me happiness... You drowned and fished me out in the waters of your sweet words... But why did you hide the shore away from me, my doll? Don't do this...you said friends. Is this how friends behave? Why did you say that then? How dare you hold my hand? ln the train! l kissed you after that but you didn't stop me. lsn't this love? l touched your feet... you didn't stop me. lsn't that love, Jessie? Did you realise the fantastic chemistry we shared? lt is still there. l want to sit there with you. l know you want it too. l thought we could be friends that's why l said that. Everything got shattered in the train on seeing you. There is no love! There is no chemistry! l don't know why l let you kiss me. Let go of me Karthik. This won't happen. Don't come after me. l came to tell you this. l can see only the troubles. My folks will never accept. My dad will kill me... even my mom. This has already happened to my sister. She fell in love. Dad didn't accept Fights and tears everyday at home. She eloped with him. My dad brought her back the same evening. Within a week got her married to another man. She has a six month child now. She's happy now. My dad made me promise him. l should marry the guy of his choice. Problems like this... - l got you. l know there are problems. l saw love in your eyes that night in the train. That's why l did that. l kissed you and you didn't stop me. lsn't it love Jessie? l'll leave this place. l like you. But l don't want this. l don't want any trouble, l don't want this now. Do you understand? Got it? You are practical...sensible... that's okay...but don't say 'No'! You like me, don't you? Don't you feel it? lt happens only once in a lifetime. lf we can't live with the person we love what's the use of living. l'll wage a bet, your sister cannot be happy That is...if she truly loved that guy, l'm sure she'll not be happy now. lt's just an act, is it a life? l didn't do anything wrong. You are not some one's wife. You are a Christian dad's daughter, l am a Hindu dad's son. lf that's what is wrong... Iet me tell you now. No one can prevent my life with you. whoever it is...even your dad. What happened to your love? Happy? It's raining, l'm hungry. This treat should have been in Taj Banjara, l'll give it on roadside eatery. Please don't mind it. Did she say only ''l lo''... not ...''ve you''? You are a genius buddy! She says she likes me but doesn't want me. Of all the girls in our city why did l have to fall for Jessie? She is most beautiful. She is also most problematic! Forget all that, is she worth it or not? Can give life for her...my life. Your life too.- My life? She used to come as if nothing had happened. She asked me to come... l went. l wondered what she's going to come up with now? Your office is in Hitech city, why did you ask me to come here? Someone could see us there. Let's not stand her and talk. Shall we go? Where? Wherever... How about a movie? 6 pm show... we can see first half and come away. Home...work... it has become a routine. First time l made a trip to Alleppey alone. l had to beg my dad for that. l made up my mind to spend time with you. l wanted to talk to you. l said l have work till 8 pm. l lied. - What? l lied. Are you watching the film? Like it? Or can l talk? - Like it... But we can talk. Let's remain as just friends, Karthik. Otherwise there will be too many problems. l don't want that. Nowadays l feel like talking to you, spending time with you. That's why l am here with you. l don't want to lose this. lf there's love be_een us... we can't be free. lts too much pressure. What people will think, we'll be worried if someone is seeing us, l'll go home and tell my dad, Karthik who lives downstairs is my friend we don't have anything be_een us. Can l tell him not to worry? You can come up and spend time with me in my home. We can be as ourselves. You are the first guy to kiss me. l have not dated any guy. l'll walk home from here. What are you trying to prove, Jessie? That it's no big deal? How can l remove my love? That too for your dad? Then you talk about your first kiss. You won't touch me while riding on the bike, You think if your hand touched me l would do something. When you were in Alleppey, l wanted to kiss you here. Even if you are 100 feet away from me l feel like touching you, it will always be there, when l am 70, you will be 72, even then l will feel the same way. Then, how can we be just friends? Do you understand anything l am saying? You feel like spending time with me, its only because of love... Take that love away... then you won't feel this way. You wanted to go tell your dad something, what was that? Karthik living downstairs and l are just friends, there's nothing be_een us. You should say Karthik loves me, he wants to spend his life with me, go and tell your dad. Your dad let you go alone to Alleppey for the first time. He's not the same Joseph he was in your sister's time. l think he has changed... he'll accept me. We'll not have any problem. Go and tell him. She walks away, lf she doesn't like some thing she walks away immediately. l have seen more of her back than her front! Not that l was complaining Why are you torturing me, Jessie? l got this feeling. My love for you is as vast as the sky... lt wants to share joy with you only... Don't cite silly reasons... Don't care about this world... Where's the book that says love is sin? There's no law that says Iove is crime... Once fallen in love, heart won't accept friendship... Time never moves backwards... Don't torture me saying l'm your friend... Why don't you think me as your love? What life says...if you hear it... Won't you understand eveything? Though you like me, will you cheat yourself? You were silent when l kissed you... You ask me to stand away scuttling my Yesterday my brother saw you talking to me near my office. l'm telling you, it will be a disaster. l am following you for a month singing songs. Telling you one thing only. You are ignoring me. l'm on terrace. l think it's going to rain, shall l get the clothes? Okay, no...no...l'm going out. - Go away. Has father come back? Okay, l'll come. Want me to come down? Coming...coming... Nothing like that. Come here. Hang up, l'm coming. Saw you yesterday in front of her office, Today you are holding her hand on the terrace. You think l am dumb? - Nothing like that. l will break your face to pieces. l hardly get angry. He is Jessie's brother. Actually l shouldn't get mad with him. But the word he flung at me. Then l thought to myself... l love only Jessie... not him! Bloody! How dare you hit me? Jerry, listen to me. l'm telling you to stop it. - How dare you hit me? l told you many things about me. He used foul language. l'll kill him. - Okay, go ahead. But l didn't tell you one thing. Okay. You'll pay for it dearly. You'll get a spanking from me. You don't know about me. - l'm coming down.- l'll show him what l'm. lf you'd noticed the way l hit Jerry, you will see a boxer's style! Yeah, l am a boxer. ln school l learnt boxing along with cricket and football. My coach called me as 'light foot'. Now you'll see why. Come...come...will you hit me? This is for hitting me. Fall at my feet, otherwise you will get smashed by everyone here. You'll never get up. Jerry, let me close the shutter. We'll take on him then. Wait, you're not that worth. Don't get excited, come here. lf you had called me l would have come. why unnecessarily bring all your friends? l shouldn't have hit you. What happened yesterday was wrong. And there's nothing be_een Jessie and me the way you think. Say sorry! l think l'm doing wrong, but still don't mind. Are you a boxer? Hit me...hit me... Come. Don't... Hi dad! Did you hit Jerry? What's the problem with him? His dad came and yelled at me. Why do you put me in such a spot? His dad will ask us now to vacate. You won't be there to help me house-hunt. Why did you hit him? l didn't hit him, dad. He brought some guys to hit me. You want me to get hit and keep quiet? Move dad. Did he bring friends to hit you? He came down and yelled as if you were to blame. Did you try anything with Jessie? Should we've to discuss it here? Let's go in. Come in mom...dad. Dad got angry because Joseph abused him. You said he hit you but it is Jerry's face that is bruised! Karthik, tell me the truth. Nothing mom, l was talking to her generally. Her brother made a big issue out of it. He tried to get my girl. Wastrel! Won't her brother get angry? lf my son comes after your daughter... won't you get mad? Does that justify ganging up to hit him? Will you bring goons? l should be the one to give a police complaint! Your son must go to jail. Your son is the rascal not mine! Why would try your daughter? You think my son is jobless? Complaint to police? Go ahead, we'll see what happens. l know he is jobless... trying to be a director? ls that a profession? He needs to be properly qualified to marry my daughter. Your daughter parks herself like a car in my house. and you want a qualification? Ask her...she would have said some thing. My son didn't go up to your house. Your daughter is the one always in our house.- l know about my daughter. l will book him on eve teasing charges... he will get thrashed properly. Let the court decide who is wrong. - Father, please... l'll not get mowed by your threats. This is my house...- Please go, dad. - You vacate immediately. l've paid 4 months advance. l should be given 3 months notice. l will go to consumer court. l thought it's all over... but she said it's over really. l thought you loved me?! How can you hit your Ioved one's brother? How can you fight with him? Or did you listen to what l said and now you've stopped loving me? And so you went and hit him with that frustration? You think l should have taken the beating for your sake? You want me to grovel at his feet? l can't. You know how much l love you, Jessie. They are arranging my marriage. Because of this trouble? They had planned it already, fixed the date now. Did you know that when we were on the train? No...the day l met you here... told you l like you... That morning dad talked to me. Today morning he confirmed it. They told me. l knew this would happen. But l thought l could somehow convince them about you. But now after this fight l don't know what to talk about you and how? No other way. Next month 23rd is the wedding in Kerala. ln the same church where you met me. What do you want me to do, Karthik? Go get married, Jessie! You didn't come to ask my permission. You just wanted to inform me, right? You have told me...go...and marry. l saw her just once after that. She smiled... lt was poetic... And made me mad too. And then they all left for the wedding _o weeks earlier. Needless to say we weren't invited. l want to go for her wedding. What? To Kerala? Big men in colored lungis will beat you to pulp. They will cut you into pieces. We can't even enter the premises. - l have to go buddy. You insist on going, give me one good reason, why? l love her, buddy. l have to see her face. l have to go for her wedding! Church wedding climax comes in many films. Church wedding climax now in your life also. Do you need to be there personally? My left eye is batting rapidly. Do you know those people? Baldie has seen us. Food...food... Please come in... Jessie's classmates are inside. Come. After marriage, please enjoy the feast and go. We will have. He's too... - Got caught. Why is everyone looking at us strangely? Please come in, uncle. Jerry is here, be careful. - You be careful. He doesn't know me. Do we need to go through all this? Of all the women in the world why did l fall in love with Jessie? However many times you ask me, l have no answer to that. Shall l go and talk to her? - Not now. Sit. Get up! Even now we can leave... Iet's go. Buddy, she is very happy. Shall we go now? l told you this right then. Did you listen to me? l knew you would get affected. lfwe get up and go everyone will see us. Did they ask her if she is willing? They'll ask her first, right? Haven't you watched films? They will ask the groom first. What? l have seen it in the movies. They will ask the crowd if there's any objection. Shall l raise my hand and object? Raise objection? With so much crowd here? No way, if he sees us, we are dead. Roy Thomas, do you willingly, whole heartedly take Jessie as your lawfully wedded wife? l do. Jessie, do you willingly, whole heartedly take Roy Thomas as your lawfully wedded husband? l want to talk to you... l don't want to get married. l don't want this marriage as of now. Do you know what's happening there? She said she doesn't want this alliance and stopped the wedding. What are you saying, buddy? Please make my dad understand. Forgive me for it. Jessie, what are you saying? ls there someone else? - Dad, please! There's no one. What? - She has seen us! There is someone... that's why she is like this! Why are you doing this after coming so far? Jessie, please listen to me. Even if there is... you won't approve. This isn't why l called off the wedding. First she said no, then said even if there's one you'll not approve, lf she points a finger at you, that's it! We are in big trouble, Iet's go buddy. No problem, nothing will happen, l'll take care. - You will be fine, l have a problem. Please dad, l want to go home now. Wait! You know what you are getting us into? You must come home and have dinner with us. lt's my treat for getting a 'first class' in MCA. Come, let's also join. - My dear! l'm not hungry. Jessie is mine. There was only one thought in my head. And she is worth dying for! Look at the old lady, how she's creating a scene. They are hitting each other. It's risky to be here, let's go. Now, do you know why l insisted on coming here?- Okay, come. l could see her face. Did you see the happiness on her face when she saw me? But l saw our future, lf she had said there's a guy, if she had pointed her finger at us, we would be dead by now. Now l know why Jessie refused. But to say it here, now, you need real guts! She has captured a place in my heart. Don't know where my life is leading me to? Are you saying crossroads of life? Good philosophy. You will find a solution. lf we straight, a vehicle will come, a little further up, we'll get a road. Didn't l say about a vehicle coming? Bus has come. Let's get into this bus... - Are you sure? Your life is about to change. Come... Get it...get in l say. Looks like the same church. Not looks like... it is the same church, buddy. Her brother has spotted us. - He won't, bus is on move. Come fast! He won't. - He is coming after us. Go fast and stop that bus. Go fast! They are coming after us. You were the one who said l'll find a new path, lt's all messed up, l didn't think your path will change so soon. Stop the bus. They will blame us for the marriage cancellation. She didn't even know our plans. It's all gone haywire. Go fast....go fast... Let them come, l'll say l'm big hero, they'll go away. They will smash us... not let us off. Go fast. Stop the bus!... Buddy, operation showdown. - Okay. Why did you come here? lsn't he Jessie's classmate? He had come home for lunch, the last time Jessie was here. They were there in the church. Did you come to stop the marriage? Get down. What man?- Why should we get down? - You keep quiet please. Why should we get down? What have we done? Buddy, you stay there, don't rush, l'll deal it. Trust me. Buddy, he hit me! Hit your 'brother-in-law'...he hit me. If you can't l'll hit him. Why did you hit him? What's the trouble there? lf my family comes to know, entire area will go. Stop... They came from Hyderabad and created ruckus in church.- Police! What's the trouble here? Who are they? They hit Sunny. They hit us sir. That guy hit us sir. Come with me. - What's this trouble, buddy? Of all the girls in the world why did you fall in love with Jessie? That's exactly what l'm also thinking. You said you will give your life... Iooks like it's going to happen. Anyway one day we all have to die. She is worth it, buddy! Oh my God! You will say anything. Two things l hate in this world... hospital and police station. Now l'm in police station because of you. Your brother-in-law's punches will anyway take me to a hospital. How hurt my fans will feel on knowing this? Her wedding has been called off, buddy! Oh God! Is it time to feel happy? There isn't anyone else... it was a lie what l said in the church. Why did you come to the church, Karthik? Was it for me? Am l the problem now? lf l decide something it's a problem for you, right? Then why am l here... you decide whatever you want. Dad! They are here. - Who? Karthik and his friend. He has come here before also. They might have planned to elope... l think like that. Where are they now? l have booked them under a false complaint of hitting Sunny. Why a false complaint of hitting cousin Sunny? What is this? ls Karthik in the police station? Have you ever understood me, Jerry? lf l had wanted to elope, l would have done it long ago. There's no connection be_een me stopping the wedding and Karthik being there. l didn't even know he was there. l saw him only when l was walking out. Dad, please bring him out of the police station immediately. Why Karthik has been arrested, mom? What did Karthik do? So you are fond of him! l thought he was the one angling for you. Roy Thomas is vice president of Future Line in San Francisco Who is he? A film director! Is that a job to be proud of? What future prospects does that have? Moreover a Hindu! l might eat in their house but my daughter will marry only to a Christian. Don't you remember what happened to your sister?- Dad! l promise l won't see him or talk to him. Just get him out, that's enough. She promised not to see him again. Let's end this here. Bring him out and let him off. Buddy, look! Please come in sir, take your seat sir. Both sides have hit each other. l am just taking their statement. No need of it. There's fault on our side also. Let them off. You don't have to write a case. Are you sure? - Sure. You both can go! - Thank you sir. When they were travelling in bus, our boys stopped the bus, Jerry and others hit them. - Come... They have come from Hyderabad. - Why are you staring at him? We have come to an unknown place, l can get my fans agitate. Let's just leave. Okay. Why is he calling again? You manage him, whatsoever, he's your father-in-law. Please don't disturb us She has promised not to talk to you or see you. That's why l agreed to let you out. Otherwise you will be sitting inside for a week.- Got it? lf you have any idea of running behind her...forget it. Atleast from now, be careful. l will take care sir. Come, buddy. Go back home in one piece. We are on it, sir. Go away! We are on it, sir. - Get lost! lf everything becomes okay one day, that old man will become your father-in-law, how will you talk to this man? How will you talk to her brother? How can you be friendly after all this? l don't think so. Let's see when it happens. l have to see her once. What? Have you gone mad? Police station is better. Buddy, please... - l don't want to die here. l know that girl is your life. What a dialogue! - What is he saying? He is saying she is my life. What a dialogue! - How does he know that? Even he knows! lf you get caught, don't betray me. What's this guy talking about? Let's go back. Wait, l'll be back in minutes. - Go carefully. l have to see you, Karthik. l have to talk to you. Just once...now! Then l won't see you or talk to you like l promised dad. Where are you Karthik? You look beautiful in your wedding sari! l was just thinking of you and you are here. What if someone sees us? l can't even imagine the consequences. l have seen you...go! Please come out. l have promised not to see you or talk to you. Promises are meant to be broken. Thanks for breaking off the wedding. You need guts for that. Why before such a large gathering? Jessie, you didn't like the guy? l love you, Karthik. You realised it only in the church? You don't go to church in Hyderabad? Did l torture you too much? Why didn't you tell me this earlier? When did you feel it? l liked you the moment l set eyes on you. When you saw me near the gate, each time l saw something in your eyes. When l saw you in the terrace l wanted to touch your face. When you proposed to me, walking by my side on the road, l thought you found out, When you apologised to me here, When you wrote 'Friends' in the train, my heart pounded louder than the train! That's why l didn't stop you. That's why l kissed you. Enough! Don't be here...go home. l told you this would happen. l was fearing for this only. It's all because of me. Come with me... l'll take care of everything. Dad has to say 'yes' Do you understand? l can't otherwise. l just don't know why he is so stubborn...only in this. He is a good man. He has to accept... l can easily leave all this behind. lt's true. But everyone should be happy... Isn't that what you also want? l'll take care of it. l'll convince my dad. l don't know how... but l will convince him. l will come... for you! - You will come for me? You are saying what l should be saying. Karthik, go! My heart utters your name only... Stopped it on the tip of my lips... l arrested your heart with my silence... Please forgive me, my dear... Chasing boon... Touching rhythm... l'm saying my life is yours... Are you listening? l heard...thousands of Veenas playing rhythms of happiness in my heart... first time in the words you say... l heard the thrill of classic music... That's enough, my love... l heard you say l love you while l'm still alive... Don't know what will happen in future? Whatever may happen, you take care of it... l'll never leave you, are you listening, my dear? l was floating like a piece ofwhite paper in air... You stopped it and wrote on it... l'm listening to those songs only... First time an experience of bliss... A boon that lets' you experience the bliss for the first time... lt is older that sky... lt existed before earth came into existence... lt was born with time and became part of it... lt is heartless love... Come, l'll hide you in my embrace... l'll become yours and part of you... ln places where nobody ever met... ln times where nobody thinks of anyone... Here's your key, bye. You direct the van, we'll follow you. What Karthik? First day? Don't take for granted l'll teach you something here, nobody teaches you anything here, we've to learn ourselves. You'll work with other assistant directors, you'll get it. l'm in love with your sister for the past 2 years. l don't want Krishnudu to misunderstand me. He knows you are an angel... l do too. Have we ever come here before? l asked him and he said no problem. lnfact he scolded me for asking him. What's bothering you, Jessie? - l have been lying too much at home. l don't like it. What if my dad never agrees? How long will you wait? Do l really have to answer this? l know you'll say however long. lt's not you...it's me! l never thought l would love you this much. l can't be without you for too long. l heard something which you said, right? No lies...must feel at ease. Shouldn't be worried if someone sees us. lf l can't be that way l don't want anything. Convince your dad... l will show you how to live. lsn't that the real problem?! Come like my breath and music of my life... Come like light in my life... Come like dream come true... Come like the steps l take... Join me and walk with me... Feel like being like this always. How will you make films then? - l will make. l could get your love, can't l make films? lf everything goes well as l plan, l'll definitely make films. Your film's dialogue? Sounds good, right? Why is today so special? - Maybe this is the last time. Why did you say that? Felt like saying it. You are off to Goa for film shoot. 45 days, you'll be there and l'll be here, separately. May be that's why. May be that's why l love you. My heart loves you and it's singing like birds of spring... lt's watching me with pity silenced by the summer... Don't know where's that sprouting moment is hiding? l like the location, l'll come little late tomorrow, Karthik...stand there. Little that side. Little this side. You're the hero, he's separated from the heroine for nearly 45 days, you be in that feeling, place camera low, zoom in slowly. What are you so pre-occupied with? - Nothing sir.. Looks like busy with SMS's. lf you don't concentrate here, it's like a slap on my face. What a lousy place! No ne_ork in mid town too. Roy, you've come early. You said you'll be here by 12.30. Okay, come in. What's it, Jessie? No need of this scene today, film it on some other day. lt's nice, very important scene, sir. l know it is important but clichTd which father has supported love. if he did he won't be accepted by the audience, otherwise the father will threaten to commit suicide, how many films will have the same dialogue? Let's think of something new. Let's end this topic right now. Jessie, look... Let's fix marriage after 5 or 6 months. Phone call, Karthik? - No problem sir. Director will get angry. Director is taking it serious. Finish your call...switch off the camera, we'll shoot later. l'll switch it off. - Go ahead, talk. l'm in good mood, Iet's go for take. Are you supporting your friend? You could've done it early, right? Karthik...why didn't you call? Not even a single SMS? Jessie, l was... l didn't get anything from you after that. l thought it may become problem, so l didn't call you back. l sent an SMS, you didn't reply to it also. Too many problems here... l'll come there. What are you saying? What happened? Same thing...again. You will only get irritated if l tell you. You will get angry. l've decided l can't be here. Tell me where...l'll come now. Didn't l tell you l will come for you? Jessie, l am in Goa. lt'll take five hours drive to reach city. How will you come here? Are you telling me not to come? l'm not saying don't come... but not now. Alone, so far... There's nothing proper here. You can't stay here. Listen to me. l'll be there soon. We will sit and talk...okay? You don't want to be with me? ln Kerala, that day you asked me to come away with you? Today you are saying ''don't''. That day you also said you won't, Why this change of mind today... all of a sudden? l'll come there... we can't be together here. l am working day and night. l'll come there, let's decide. We'll decide, okay. l'll wait till you come. Take out the light, field is appearing. Brother, loosen the cable, can't reach. When did Jessie tell you this? Day before yesterday night, buddy. - Then why didn't you tell me yesterday? So what do you want to do now? l'll somehow meet her and come back. Please get me permission from the director. Okay, l'll talk to him. You go now. Near the park on the left. Why did you come? What is this SMS? l sent it because you were in Goa. l thought you'll not come. l can't make you understand. l can't talk to you. l'm here now? Tell me what l should do. Where do you want to go? Okay then, tell me what the hell is your problem? l am your problem, Karthik. l'm the real problem. l chose a wrong time to say l was coming. You couldn't do anything, right? Atleast for ten minutes you would have thought what to do, right? That isn't how it should be. l don't want you to suffer because of me. l know this won't change. Yes, l wanted to come that day. That moment. Today, l feel like l want to let go. Not feel, l've decided. l told you earlier... you didn't take me seriously. You didn't take it as a problem. l love you, but said no. lf you hadn't come after me, l would have been just myself. l would have married the guy my dad chose. Why did you say you love me? Why did you come to Kerala and apologise? Why? Why did you kiss me in the train? Why did you come for my wedding? Why did you follow me? Six months...how we spent time? How many problems you'd to face? You know, right? Why then? This doesn't feel good... l don't want it. Let's forget and move on. Your decision is wrong. lt's not a problem at all. l'll wait however long. If you're 52, l'll be 50, l'll wait till then. l'll see you now and then. That's why l don't want it. Why should you wait? l'd rather lose you, than my parents! Please let me go. l swear this won't work. l can never do that. l can't. l won't. lt's only because of your dad and brother?! l will talk to them. Please Karthik don't do it, it'll be embarrassing. Go away, please. l swear something has happened to you. You've gone mad. This is how l am Karthik... l don't know myself any more. l don't know what l want. l like pain...l like this pain. Of all the girls in the world why did you fall in love with me? What did l do? l just walked past you... That's all l did. l hate watching films. Darkness...crowd...loud noise. And isn't it an irony you chose to be a filmmaker? You and l won't gel. Are you mad? You don't like films? For that will you leave me? Call Jessie. You'll not understand words. Karthik, just go away. l didn't realise this pain would be so intense. Don't hate me too much... l don't know why l did this! Sheer madness...so foolish... just couldn't figure out why! Those same thoughts in my mind. Just go...so humiliating! ''What? Did your brother send you?'' l said ''l just came to see her,l don't even know where my brother is''. Did you see her? She's got married! She's not here, she is somewhere in the U.K. He even apologised for not inviting us as it was all done in a hurry. You have drifted far away from me Jessie. You have even closed all doors! Why did you stop Karthik? Forget all this and concentrate on your work. We got yelled at because of you yesterday! Director thinks you are the only capable assistant! ls that why you are kneeling down beside me? l heard you even know Hindi? Do you've to tell him that too? Is it necessary? Don't be so pleased with yourself. He'll suddenly bark at you... when he's angry, that's it. Got it? l don't know when it happened. Before you say anything else l have to tell you something. l loved a girl... it's _o years since she left me. l am unable to forget her. l don't know where she is... what she's doing? But she is sitting here... and not going away from me. l can easily get into a relationship with you. But it won't be whole hearted. l can't be crazy about you. You will realise it yourself. She's haunting me... l have to come out of this. Till then let's refrain, Nandini! l don't know what to say. l have been trying to write script for the past six months but couldn't. Don't know why? l got a good idea now for a script. l am going to write now. The breeze that climbs over mountains... The newly-wed breeze... That worships the cross on the church steeple... To that breeze, the land of Kerala extends a warm welcome... My darlingt My darlingt My darlingt My darlingt This auspicious moment may you be happyt May the bride forever be happily wedded Of all the girls in the world... why did l fall in love with Jessie? Correct? l know a little Telugu. l'm writing it. lt'll definitely work out. My film has been confirmed. Congrats buddy. - Thanks buddy. l'm so happy buddy. Thanks buddy, eveything was possible because ofyou. What's the title of your film...Jessie? You are a geniust ls there enough love for the sea to serenade to the shore? Do you still have love in your heart to melt like a candle? My darlingt My darlingt My darlingt ln this auspicious moment may you be happyt May the bride forever be happily weddedt lf you had seen me and gone away l would not have come after you. l know, you've been doing that for the past three years. l am glad you came... that's why we are here now. l would not have gone away without talking to you. That's what l have been doing all these years. Enough. You've become a director. My first film is half way through, 30 days of shoot left...release in summer. Your dream, right? It's come true. l am truly happy for you. Only few can do it. How's everyone at home? They are all good. What else? Do you want to say or ask some thing? There is some one else in your life...Karthik? l am sure there is. Someone beautiful... with clarity of thought. Unlike me. You found, right?. Yes, there's another girl in my life, Jessie. Tell me about her. Very beautiful girl, She is very intense, she speaks very well. She loves me very much. She liked me the moment she saw me. l too got connected to her. We are always together. When you left me... l didn't even know why... For sometime l was angry... l was clueless for 3 months. Everything is well set now. After that my life has been good. Tell me about her. Kind of curly hair till here, feel like smiling when she walks. Lovely voice...hates foul language... wears sari often. Has a style of her own... hardly uses make-up... Can look at her... non-stop. We have been out a lot on my bike. She loves me a lot. But she hates watching movies. l have kissed her... her Telugu has a touch of Malayalam. l flipped for that! l have held her in my arms for three hours. l'm mad about her. Her name is Jessie, Jessie! She is still there in my life. After you left me, l moved on...to her. Can't forget my first love that easily. But l am not in her life. She loves her mom and dad a lot. More than me. Don't get me wrong, l appreciate that. How many girls will feel that way? Knowing they won't accept me, she left me. l think she's married. Whatever it is...she left me. l am not married, Karthik. lt's true that l left you... but l am still single. My dad refused to accept you. l refused to accept his choice and l landed here. lt's _o and a half years since l came here. My parents were here last year. My dad asked me to get married... l refused. He left in anger. l don't have anyone...only you. True... l agree...first love...can't forget. There's not a moment you are not with me. l am sorry l walked away... didn't pick your calls. l thought you will move on. We shouldn't have met... l would have carried on with my life. Let's marry, Jessie... today...now! lf we meet ten years later... you'll say ''that moment is gone, why didn't you ask me then?'' l'm asking you for the second time... Iet's get married. l want to live with you, that's my last wish. l don't have any other wish. Let's get married right now. Let's start our life together from today. Okay, let's get married. But what about your parents? We have been apart only for their sake. l'll take care...l'll handle it. Let's get married. This is America. l can kiss you in the middle of the road!! Whom He decides to be a couple... He will unite them in the end... My heart, l saw again and again... pinched myself if it's true... Believed what was happening... l saw you with me, l saw myself with you... l gave all myself to you... God has decided Iong back to unite us... We'll never split... She's milky way... You're gentle drizzle... The love in you is eternal... She's pupil of eye... You're eyelid... Nobody can ever separate them... My heart, l saw again and again, l saw in your eyes... Eons of happiness... l saw you with me, l saw myself with you... l walked along with you... Dawns think of sweet nights... Courtyards are waiting with fragrantjasmine twigs... Sky...earth...wind...fire...water... all the elements are welcoming us... When love fever comes down... lf you think it's marriage... Modern era will end with death only... Teresa, see who's at the door. l am in the rest room. Hey! Film is over. They didn't show what the dad said. He showed what is to be shown. Who cares... they got together, right? How's the film? Awesome! You've done a great job. l saw myself on screen. l felt like seeing myself. l saw myself on screen. Even the house looks the same. l wanted it that way... put up a set like that. Can't make all the incidents in our life into a film. l haven't shown anything wrong. l didn't say that. Am l such a good person? Not at all. l showed you as good person for the film. The movie is a hit... good response... Entire team is going to PVR, joining us sir? You carry on, l'll join you later. - Okay sir. They will say like that only, l've to find it out myself. Only then l'll know the real talk. Everyone seems to know you are talented...except me. You should've married another girl. This is the sixth film l have seen. l can't understand or appreciate films. lf you're with me, l'll make only good films. That scene in Central park made me almost cry. l never said so many sorry. Your heroine said it three times. Did we kiss in the middle of the road? Yes. No way. l remember very well. You carried me, turned around but never kissed me. What's this Jessie? You've forgotten it. What a kiss it was! A kiss that gave me life. How can l forget it? l've an idea. lf my dad watches this film, he'll definitely like you. Dad has started to talk to me again, let's bring him to watch the film. l'll think tonight, how to bring him here? l don't have any hope. If you want get him. l need to visit theatres, come l'll drop you at home. l'll also come with you, Karthik. - Is it? You hate darkness, crowd, and noise. Will you take me now or not? Okay, come. l can never understand you or your father.
