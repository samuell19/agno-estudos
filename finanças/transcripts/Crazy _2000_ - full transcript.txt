This is the large dining hall. Not many kids here yet. Most of the students won't be back from vacation till tonight. - I see. What a view! Wow! Isn't this great? - Hey, Benni. Have a look. - Oh! Really nice people and such clean air. - Don't you think so? - Great air! Bye. Don't smoke too much. - He shouldn't smoke at all. Take care. Bye. Stop the car. In a few clays, you'll really like it here. If you have any problems, just call. You know, I'll always be there for you. I've been to four schools. This is supposedly my last one on the magnificent road to graduation. I have to get rid of my "F" in math, or I'll flunk. I got four months to do it, until summer vacation. My father says, "You're nothing without a high school diploma." Dropping out after middle school would be really embarrassing. Hi. What're you staring at? I just moved in. - Congratulations. I'm Benni What about you? Janosch. I think we're in the same class. Wicked! - Hello. - Hello. Quiet, please. I hope you had a nice vacation with your families. Here's the new boy. May I sit down? I can't do that. In French lessons, we speak French. Just say it in a simple way. That's how we do it at the castle. My name is Benjamin. I'm sixteen years old. And I'm a cripple. My left arm and my left leg are paralyzed. Knowing that might be of benefit to both, you and me. That's all I know. Sit down next to Janosch. There's an empty seat. Well now Tell me about what you did during your vacation. Good bye. Don't forget your homework! Could you show Benjamin around the castle this afternoon? This is the main office. The 9th and 10th grades are there. The 7th and 8th grades are over here. I'm ruining your whole afternoon. - No, you aren't. I can imagine you have something better to do. It's okay. Don't worry about it. This is my favorite place. It's quiet here, and it smells good, too. The rooms for the upper grades are upstairs. They're smaller, because there aren't as many students. - Wait a sec. I need a break. - Sure, I'm sorry. What're they doing? - That's the junior fire brigade. We have after-school activities: photography, drawing, computers, pottery. Everybody joins a club. - What about you? - Choir. I've never had a girlfriend or any real friends. I'm happy when people leave me alone and don't make fun of me. Speed junkie Isabelle loves to take summer rides in her Cadillac. But what's that? The engine stutters, she's out of gas. With her two big spare cans she goes off in search of a gas-station attendant with a big nozzle. Hey, kid. D'you like me? C'mon, let's go home together. We'll have lots of fun. 1 mark 70. There's something else, too. What about your dick? It isn't paralyzed, is it? No. - You oughta be happy. - I am. Well? What thou mean'? Ever fucked anyone before? - None of your business. So you haven't. What if I haven't? - Nothing. Just asking. No, I haven't fucked anybody yet. Haven't even come close to it. You might as well ask if I've been to the moon. Sorry, if I hit a sore spot. Must be terrible never to have fucked. G'night. How old are you? - Prettiness doesn't count. It's the tits. - Yours, too? I don't know what you got against me. And I really don't care. All I ask is that you treat me like you treat everybody else. I'm talking to you. I'm listening. D'you think that's possible? - Sure, if you want, we'll treat you like a normal guy. Thanks. That'd be a really big help. I'd say, let's start right now. Okay, guys? Mom, it's me, Benni. - Mommy! They sprayed water all over me! I'll call back. Don't gimme that look. It's just water. Are you pissed off? Every new guy has to go through it. It's a ritual. A fucked-up ritual! You told us to treat you like a normal guy. But not like that. You guys really hurt me. Fucking asshole. Jesus! Then go home. This is no kindergarten. Call Mommy and go home. I didn't call. So I was accepted. Janosch has a weird sense of humor. It takes a while to get used to, and you always have to be ready for it. Sometimes he's like a little abandoned dog. You never know when he'll bite. Kugli is the best table soccer player at boarding school. His father owns an entire soccer team in Bochum. It bothers him that his son didn't become a soccer player. Florian's nickname is "Girl." He lost his parents in a car accident. His grandmother takes care of him. She cuts his hair and buys him those wonderful clothes. The thin guy, Felix, is waiting for his musical breakthrough. He and his band haven't had a gig yet, 'cause they can't agree on a name. Troy's been here longer than the others. Some days, he never says a single word. Nobody knows what's on his mind. He's the only guy with his own room. He doesn't even let the cleaning lady in. They made an exception for him because of his family problems. Put a little bit here. Hey, Benni. What's wrong? Homesick. Everybody feels that way at first. J ust drink it away. We all wanna go home. But we can't. I think we're all chunks of meat in a big, fat can of dog food. And Kugli is the biggest chunk. Goddamn it! Adolescence is fucked up. If I were 18 or 20, I could do what I want. What's your problem? We're the big heroes. -What? Yeah, 'cause the chicks go for us. - I never noticed. Fat, crippled, silent, dumb. Chicks go for that. Fringe groups- Jesus, Felix! It stinks! Benjamin, what book did you work with at your old school? It was blue. And how far did you get? About to the middle. But we left stuff out. I see. I think you'll need some tutoring. Probably. I just have to find time for everything. I hope you're not avoiding the issue. - Of course not. C'mon, Benni. Here! - Benni! - Don't shoot! C'mon! Felix! - They're like antelopes. - Why? Graceful and unapproachable. Don't pet. - How do you like her? - Who? Malen. - Yeah, she's okay. - Okay? I think Malen is incredibly precious. - Huh? - Yes. She's luxurious. Everything about her. Her body, her clothes, the way she moves. Don't you think so? I haven't really thought about it until now. As long as I can remember, I've always been in love with a girl. But I don't remember ever going with one. They always thought I was weird. I had about as much luck with girls as I had at school None. I was only good at watching other guys pick up the girls I was in love with. I was really good at that. See you then. - Well? - It was Dad. He'll be home later. Did he say why? - Something at the office. Has to be finished by tomorrow. He said we should start eating. D'you know where my yoghurt is? - What yoghurt? You know what I mean. The one up on the left. Maybe I ate it. - Wonderful! I bought it just for this breakfast! Excuse me. Are we going to argue about some yoghurt? I only wanted to have breakfast with my family. - You know we aren't arguing about yoghurt! - Then why? - Our agreement! You simply ignore it. That's why we're arguing. I can buy a whole crate of yoghurt! - It isn't just the damn yoghurt! So what's the problem? - I have a compartment in the fridge! Here's your fucking yoghurt! I don't feel like eating with you now. They make me so sick. I don't believe it. Be happy you're at boarding school. I'm not. I'd rather be at home. All they ever do is argue. We're still a family. - A family I could do without. Maybe, but I can't. - You can't always tie yourself to Mom's apron strings. I don't. - Sure, you do. You always have. - Yeah? I'm just not normal. I'm a cripple. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Your fucking handicap thing really gets on my nerves. Marlen or Malen? Just Malen, without an "r." When I'm around her, I always feel like an idiot. Then I start to sweat and talk about ridiculous stuff. That's what it's like to be in love. - Yeah. But it's so complicated. Could I ask for your attention, please? Quiet! We have a guest in Neuseelen, Ms. Westphalen. - Hello. She'll teach sexual education in the 9th grades. She'll be available every afternoon for all students who are interested, in room 202. You can go to her with your problems and questions. - She's kind of sexy, isn't she? APPROPRIATE AND INAPPROPRIATE WORDS We have a list with two empty columns. I'd like you to tell me all the terms you know for sexual intercourse. Who knows any? "Fuck." Okay, I'll put it in the column for inappropriate terms. Yes, here. - "Drill." - "Drill." "Screw." - "Screw." I think it fits in here, too. "Bang!" "Bang." If you don't mind, I'll put it here. The left side is still empty. I know one. "To have sexual intercourse." That's very inappropriate! Okay, what thou say'? What's your favorite word? - My favorite? "Crack." "Crack the cherry." Who has another suggestion? You? I say "sleep with someone." "Sleep with someone." What do you notice? There's quite an imbalance, and I think we need 1 or 2 more appropriate terms. Who wants to try? I know another one, but I'm not certain where it belongs. Go ahead. We can decide together what column is most suitable. "G rind." Now what do we have? One, two, three Also "screw" So four words dealing with work. That's very conspicuous. What does it tell us? Maybe that sex is a craft. - Sex is a handicraft. I'd like to talk to you about that. - Some people say "ball." I've never before seen a person who smokes so erotically. Like this. What're we gonna do this afternoon? How about consulting that sex chick in her office. - And do what? - Yeah, what? Is there something special about it? Some kind of kick? I think it could be a kick. Like if somebody went there and said, "rm gay_" - You, Benni? - No. No? Are you scared? How about you? - No. - Then do it. - Okay. I will. And what do I get? - A beer. A beer! A beer? Okay, if I go there and act like I'm gay, I want a liter of tequila. - A liter of tequila? A liter of tequila! It's kind of embarrassing to me. Ask anything. That's why I'm here. Okay. You see Troy here has made me a couple of offers. What kind of offers? He asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. Yes, well I don't know if that would be good for me. Can I just try it out, or is there a danger of becoming homosexual? - Do you share a room? - Not yet. But he's already applied. Troy, what's wrong? Shouldn't I have said anything, or what? Hey, Troy. Are you okay? You went too far. You're always making fun of people. Why? Stay outta this, okay. It was a joke. Your problem if you didn't get it. One of those jokes nobody laughs at. - You got your own problem. Me? What kind of problem do I have? Adolescents usually hate themselves for two reasons. They're too fat, or they've never had sex. - Stop it. - I know why you hate yourself. So what? I'm fat. What difference does it make? Are you such a petty-minded asshole that you got a problem with it? Okay, sorry. I went a bit too far. Sorry. Whenever you act like that, Janosch, I wonder if we're still friends. Why not? We're bosom buddies. You asshole! - No! Stop it! - No, I won't! Terrific! How can I describe boarding-school life? One of many lives. And I'm getting used to it. I really miss my mother, my father and my sister. But I hardly have time to think about them. You're never alone at boarding school. You depend on others. Sometimes you feel a double portion of life inside. And sometimes you want to die. It's like a beautiful cage with bars of gold. You get fed every day and don't have to worry about the world outside. - Can I help you? - No, I'm okay. It's nice here. What're you doing today? Nothing but getting tutored in math. You've noticed I'm not very good, haven't you? Sometimes I think there are only two types of people. The type that can do math, and the type that can't. And I belong to the second type. I think I do, too. I break out in a sweat when there's an equation with two unknowns. Why do I need two unknowns. One is enough. Yeah, it isn't that easy. Sometimes an unknown just pops up, then another and another. You have to keep a cool head. What're you talking about? - Math. I thought life. - Watch out. There's a wasp. Don't move. Anyone wanna take a dip? - We're having a talk. I got a feeling Malen wants to take a dip. No! No! No! You're in for it! I'll race you to the shore. How do you please a girl? Be forward? Be a wiseguy? Flaunt a certain talent? Hey, Benni! Come on in! Girls like guys who get involved. Stay-at-homes are out. God'd probably fly around here. He doesn't do much. He just floats. Actually, I think God is crazy. - Why crazy? - Well He made women, crazy old lecher. He knows exactly what he wants. What does he want? - He wants us to live. When we stand before him, we have to decide if we've lived right or not. You really think we'll stand before him? - Sure. And I'm gonna get his autograph. - God's? - Yeah. It's a unique opportunity. - Why would he give you his autograph? He gives one to everybody, but nobody dares to ask. Don't you think it's a bit impolite? Stars feel flattered by autograph-hunters, too, don't they? It goes like this: We jack off and aim at a cookie. And the first guy who doesn't hit the cookie loses. Then what? - You eat it, coating and all. What? Yuck! Disgusting, isn't it? It wasn't our idea. You don't have to do it. - Oh yes! Everybody does. Or I don't, either! Let him get up a bit closer. It'll be easier to hit. - No special treatment. I don't get anything for free either. We either go by the rules, or you go. That's too bad, Benjamin. If you're going to copy from someone, don't copy from Janosch. You know what that means. One more "F" in your class work, and you're a goner. Some of the students still don't get the picture. We have one more exam before the school year is over. You have no reason to be funny. Your exam is the second worst. A "D" minus. You owe me a one-liter bottle of tequila. And then let's get outta here. I'm going nuts. This is like a prison. I need a change of pace. Like what? The town's absolutely dead. - Then let's liven it up. How about a striptease joint? There's one in Rosenheim. - They'd never let us in. - Hey! No problem. I know the manager's son. I'm with you. Now put down your book. - Would you be quiet. Hey, Janosch! - Math is torture. It should be forbidden. - Gimme that! I need it! What're you doing? - Making Chinese food in Anna's wok. - We don't have any time. - Great. Where are you going? - Rosenheim, to the Museum of Local History. - Supposed to be nice. An educational outing. Hey, why don't you come along. We got lots. Yeah, it sounds very inviting, but - we gotta g0-. Bye. - Bye. 16-year-old guys are embarrassing. - Especially in a group. What? When they're alone, too. What thou want'? We ain't no circus. And we got no kiddy show. I'm one of 0lli's friends. - So what? Is Olli here? See him anywhere? I don't. When does the show start? - At nine. A bit late, huh? C'mon, we're gonna pull this off. Can't you check if 0lli's there? - You guys from boarding school? Okay, but I want you outta here by 11. Excuse me. Could we have two gin and tonics? We're staying here no matter what. What sweet little boys! - Having fun? - Yeah, sure. You're nice-looking guys. Especially you. In two years, you're going to be a handsome man. Excuse me. May I treat you to a glass of champagne? Of course you may. It's starting! Hey, Benni. I'm never gonna forget this evening. You guys know you're the best, don't you? - And you're drunk. Of course I'm drunk, man. But you guys are the best guys I've ever had. - You're the best, too. - The very best. We're all the best. And we're gonna go up there. - Are you nuts? - No, man! Don't you have the guts? - Sure, I do. Together? Together. Her pubic hair was black and shaved like an arrow. I remembered what a philosopher once said, "I know that I know nothing." I wanted to submerge between that woman's legs. How could we tell the principal that Benjamin had finally touched a woman? Mr. Richter wouldn't have understood. We had broken several school rules and were reprimanded. Having looked at your homework, we'll now continue calculating the areas and angles of the pyramid. Please, open your books at page 155. Benjamin, where is your book? I think I forgot it. - Then go get it, please. It isn't a problem, is it? Should someone else get it for you? No. - I lost it. - I see. You lost it. And I can tell you exactly where you lost your book. Can you explain it to me? Come to the blackboard, please. Perhaps you've become so good mean- while that you don't even need a book. I'll give you two more minutes, but then I feel forced to How did it happen? - He just fell asleep. That guy's a total disaster. - They sewed the cut on his head. Can I go in and see him? - Yeah, okay. Falkenstein didn't give me a grade. You really saved me by falling. But still Rosenheim was really good. Absolutely. Troy, what's wrong with you? Why don't you ever say anything? I'm not gay- Explain it to me. Give me one sensible reason for that nonsense. Who paid for the drinks anyway? They're expensive. I was invited. You were invited? By the women? Were you together with one of them? - Mom, it isn't a whorehouse. They danced a bit and got undressed. You should have seen the principal. He really felt sorry for me. You have to behave, so they don't kick you out. - Ridiculous! It wasn't that bad. Boys my age do things like that. Luckily, the math teacher likes you. He wants to tutor you every afternoon. - No! What d'you mean? He'll look after you. Mom, he bugs me every morning. If I gotta go there every afternoon I'm only telling you once. You will go there. Do you understand? Damn it! I really try. That's the most I can do. I'm sorry if it causes you trouble. I don't know if it's the right thing for you or not. Did you tell Dad? No. He isn't at home. Damn it! I didn't want to tell you, but Dad's having an affair with a trainee. A 22-year-old girl. It's all so humiliating. It's all right now. Damn it! Man, that's unfair. How can I concentrate while you're hopping around in front of me with your stupid shirt. It's utterly tasteless! Hey babe, I know this'll never compete with your clothes. Anyway, I think my shirt is classy. And Malen goes for class. - Malen! You've been after her for months! It won't work. A girl like Malen needs time, and I'm gonna take my time. Oh God! I gotta tell you something. I'm in love with Malen, too. What're you grinning about? Nothing. It was obvious. So what now? I can really understand that a guy'd fall in love with Malen. It's more important that we are friends. Sure, it's how I see it, too. Anyway, I won't be insulted if she takes you. If she takes you, could you guys go to her room to make out? No problem. Wanna go down to the lake with us? - Gotta do math. That's tough on a clay like today. - Join us later, if you like. But don't bring Falkenstein with you. - We're inseparable. See you. - Bye. Fasten your seat belt, please. Perhaps you think math was invented just to torture students and it has nothing to do with you. But you're wrong. Without math, this car couldn't drive. We wouldn't even have this street here. Half the world wouldn't exist. That isn't right, Benjamin. Work it out once more, and concentrate. It just happens. Because your mind isn't working on the problem. Can't I leave a bit earlier, 'cause it's Friday? I don't believe you realize yet what's important for you. Why are you here? It's my mother's idea. But someday you're going to decide about your own future. Not your mother. And notJanosch either. Can I go now? C'mon! C'mon, Benni! C'mon, Benni! Try it! - Be careful! C'mon. I'll help you get down. Cut it out! This is our encore song, a cross between Marilyn Manson and Rammstein. - Cool. We got a band, too. - Then come to our concert tonight. Sure thing. By all means. Can I sit down there? - Sure. May I? - Yeah. Cool song structure. You like it? - Yeah. The hook line's great. Where'd you steal it anyway? Sounds like Wolfgang Petry. - Are you making fun of me? No, it's cool. But I've heard it. - It's his line. We write our songs. Why "Crazy?" It's what you always say. - That's why I asked. Does it refer to me? It's so cool. You gotta keep that amateur sound. D'you like it, or is it crap? It's Helge Schneider at 16. You could perform tonight as a pre-band. - Really, as a pre-band? - Yeah. You gotta get that place rocking. - How about it? - Sure. - We'll do it. Life is very demanding. Sometimes it's outstanding. You gotta find the way. It isn't too late yet. Experience what there is to experience before the sun goes down. Crazy, crazy enough to live it up, crazy's no reason to give it up. Crazy is everything you do, if you sing or dream or cry or laugh. Crazy enough to live it up, no reason to give it up. It's so crazy, so crazy and great The next song is by me. It's called "Wild Girls." And uh all the wild girls can dance now. If they want to. They dance like they're really wild and look really sexy, too. They can get in a crazy mood, but they don't care for you. You're never gonna find a girlfriend. They're never gonna fall in love with you. No, seriously. There's a girl I really like. - Who? I can't tell you. Yeah, well I wanted to write her a love letter, but it isn't so easy. Why are you asking me? - Should I ask Kugli? You're the romantic here. - Just write that you love her. No, nothing like that. That's why it's called a love letter. - But I'm not Kafka or Bruce Willis. They can say that. I need a pseudonym first. You should say "I love you" as Janosch. Not as somebody else. I'll write as Janosch Schwarze: "I love you." What else? What do you like best about her? Try to praise her best qualities. Make a comparison. Her eyes They're as deep and as blue as the sea. Or her smile. It's like a sunrise. Her mouth, her lips. That sounds like cheap lyrics. - Then write what you feel. Should I write that I feel terrible? Not what you feel now. What you feel in regard to the girl. What do you feel? That I want to drill her. The feeling's really strong. Then write her that. I'm sure she'll be convinced. - Are you mocking me? You're mocking yourself. Wild girls only want the best. And they get them, too. Guys with leather vests and a good hard gut. And if you want to have them, all you gotta do is lie. But you're probably gonna be a loser in the end. Other guys'll always win! What's up? Staying here for the weekend? - My father's picking me up. Okay. See you on Sunday. - See you. Sorry. It's all wet. I wet my bed at night like a baby. There's nothing I can do. I feel like puking when I look in the mirror. Got a cigarette? Are you afraid sometimes? I'm afraid most of the time. It isn't a certain thing I'm afraid of. It's life. What am I gonna do when I leave here? It's all going too fast. I can't keep up. I understand what you mean. But it's so short life is. Grab it, no matter how short the thread is. God created - Forget that ass. He isn't gonna help me. He sits up there, far away, fat and smug. He's gonna help us some day. - I've studied the Bible. It says nothing about me. I'm sorry, Benni. If Klaus had told me earlier he could not come, I'd have been here on time. That's okay. You're here now. - You, Paula and I will have a nice day. Why don't you tell us about it? - What's there to tell? It's nice. - That's very nice of your math teacher. He isn't doing it for Benni. He wants to avoid blame when There's Dad. - Let's go. - Excuse me if I start to laugh. - Mom, let's leave. We can stand it, can't we, Benni? - I'd rather go, too. Your father and his trainee should go. Are we staying? Eat your fish. Don't you like it? - Sure, I do. My vitello tonnato is wonderful. I can never make it this good at home. Want some wine? Here you are. You used to be more creative. Sorry, Juliane, I didn't know. - Don't worry. Everyone can eat - wherever they like. - Juliane. Leave us alone, please? Your girlfriend's getting bored. That isn't fair in front of the kids. - Don't be so overly sensitive. How is she in bed? Do you come more than once? Don't be so primitive. - So she thinks you're terrific and worldly wise? I'd like to introduce myself. - Please, go back to our table. I want to say hello. - Hello, and now fuck off! - You're going too far! Ridiculous. - I realize you're angry, but your style isn't appropriate. Fuck your style! Let's go! Take care of the check. We're going! Hold on a second! I can't walk so fast. - Let me at least talk to the kids. Don't forget your appointment at the urologist's tomorrow. Get in. Get lost. I wanna drive away. Oh fuck! Fuck! Not that stuff. It tastes like crap. - The girls go for it. I said no. - Let me take care of the drinks. You're in charge of snacks. Take this. It tastes better. - No. Hey guys! - Hey, babe. It'll look good on you. The red one's really wicked. None of you guys has any idea at all. So just keep your traps shut. Sometimes we all seem like heroes in a crappy photo love story. "Confused Emotions." "What's happened so far? The clever leader" of a boarding-school gang, Janosch, and his crippled friend, Benjamin, are in love with the same girl, flawless Malen. Malen has invited the boys to an illegal party in the girls' room. Benjamin has decided to go all the way at the party. Just like his friend Janosch. Melancholy Marie is still wondering "if the cool rock musician Richi is serious or just wants to play around." Get me a pack of Camels, baby. - Sometimes Richi treats me like crap. At least he could have said please. - Those two guys are so sweet. I like Janosch and his crazy ideas. Benjamin is more quiet and sensitive. If only there were someone with the qualities of both. Without the handicap, of course. It makes things very difficult. Richi and I are going to Munich. - Great. Isn't your bra a bit daring? Your bra is pretty daring, too. Want to seduce Janosch or Benjamin? We'll see who has a better chance of getting Malen tonight. She's a really cool girl. - Yeah, that's right. And you're a cool friend. - You are, too. What will happen next? Will Richi take Marie to Munich? Will Janosch conquer Malen? Or will Benni have the courage to express his love to Malen? Looks great the way she dances. You dance great. - Thanks, it's fun. Can I have a sip? - Sure. - Thanks. Ever been to Falkenstein's apartment? It's really weird. He has an iguana in the middle of the room and He lives all alone with that iguana. So what? Just lies there and stares at me the whole time. Who? Falkenstein bullshit. The iguana. Like I said. - That's funny. Wanna dance? Wait a sec. - Could we talk alone? - Now? It's important. Okay. Do you remember the day when when ljumped from the platform? Yeah. I was really scared when I climbed up. I actually wanted to climb down again. There was only one reason why I jumped down. Do you want to know Hey, Anna! - Can I use your phone? - Yeah. Are you sure Richi already left? Yeah, he wanted to pick me up. No. Okay, thanks. Bye. Well? - That jack-offs already in Munich. Marie, you can't go there now. You've already missed the concert. Why did he do that? Now I'm stuck at this fucking party for little kids. Watch out, asshole! Sorry, I didn't see you. Don't make any trouble, Benni. You piss me off! - What's wrong? - You know damn well - what's wrong! - No, I don't. Are you pissed because of Malen? Hey, Benni, this is a party, okay? So just relax. Man, I just don't know. Is it my fault that you're too chicken? I can't carry you there. You gotta go over and tell her yourself. Fuck it! Why do I feel so fucked up? Just shove your fucking advice up your ass! - I thought we were friends, Benni. Are we friends? - You don't have any friends, just stupid jerks who crawl up your ass and run after you. Okay, now listen to me. I may be drunk, but I'm gonna tell you this. She isn't the right girl for you. Why? Because she doesn't love you. It's a sympathy thing. She's nice, 'cause you're half spastic. Damn it. What's wrong? Don't you feel okay? What's wrong with you? Leave me alone. You don't understand a thing. Toilet's over there. Is everything okay? - I burned my hand. - Can I have a swig? - Sure. Thanks. That tastes like crap. There's no beer left, is there? We're out of beer. We should've bought more. How long have you been here? - Three years. Do you like it here? Well, I'm leaving soon anyway. My mom's going to England, and I'm going with her. Don't you have any feeling in your arm? You don't feel a thing? No. A little bit, but it's like when it falls asleep, like when your leg falls asleep. I just feel what hurts. I don't want to hurt you. I didn't mean what I said last night. I'm such an idiot. You hit the jackpot, Benni. You drilled a terrific girl. It hurt. - Is that what she said? No, it hurt me. Well, at least you've clone it now. You've grown up. Nobody asked me if I wanted to grow up. Was it really that bad with Marie? I mean, was everything really so terrible? It was absolutely fucked up. But it was the best thing I've ever experienced. Is everything Okay? Sure. My future looks pretty rosy. I'll be 17 soon. And my life will change radically. I met a girl the last time I went home for the weekend. It may be a new start. Who knows? Can I sit here? Actually, she thought I was weird, but when I said other girls think so, too, she thought that was weird. I don't know if it'll work out. I didn't even write the last math exam. It would have been pointless. Falkenstein would have created a new grade for me, a "G" or an "H." Janosch managed to get a "D" and passed into 10th grade. The summer party was the end of my stay at Neuseelen Castle. I've found a great school for you. A special school not really special education, but math, physics and chemistry are only minor subjects there. I'm not going there. I don't want to be the new student again. It isn't the right time to tell her, but I'm going to tell her. For sure. Hi, I wanted you to meet Carsten. This is Benni and Janosch. He studies architecture in Konstanz and came all the way for the ball. Yeah, the castle is worth visiting. A beautiful place. You're lucky to go to school here. And you live here, too. That's terrific. I think it's time to attack the buffet. Tough. - Didn't your parents come? - No. Wanna come down? Everybody's there but you. It's my last night here. It'd make me happy. - Okay, I'll see. How can I describe life at boarding school? It's very difficult for me. They do everything for you here. But you have to find your own happiness. It's funny. My last day here and the first day I've worn this. It looks good on you. On you, too. Babe, it makes you look years older. - Thanks. Want something to eat? Big suckers, aren't they? - Dig in. So you get big and strong. - Okay. What're you gonna do now? - No idea. Get an Inter-Rail Pass and travel. But don't forget us. No. I'll never forget you guys. - Sure, you will. We're just a couple of boarding-school students. - But if you're Lady Di, nobody will ever forget you. And when you die, they'll cry and throw flowers onto your grave. I promise I'll never forget you guys. How could lever forget you after all the stuff we've been through. Oh, here you are. What's up? Who goes first? - The one who asks. C'mon. Yeah, do it. - No, Malen goes first. Right, Malen goes first. Okay. Benni, we have a going-away present for you. And you have to listen to it. When I was 16, I silently said I want, I want to be big, I want to triumph and be happy and never lie. When I was 16, I silently said I want, I want everything or nothing. For you, let it always rain red roses. You should encounter every miracle on earth. Let the world reorganize. Let it keep its troubles to itself. Later on, I still said I want to see, understand, experience and hold on to so much. And later I still said I didn't want to be alone, and yet I wanted to be free. For you, let it always rain red roses. You should encounter every miracle on earth. Fortune should be very gentle to you. Let it rule your fate with love.
