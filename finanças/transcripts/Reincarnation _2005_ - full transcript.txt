An Oz Production Look, Kanako, you're a penguin. What? Why am I a penguin? I was really surprised. Why not? Penguin's cute. In my previous life, I was a fleeing soldier. Really? I don't want to imagine that. Am I a reincarnation of a fleeing soldier? An arrow might be stuck in your body. Are you all right? - Besides, it's fluffy. - No way! It's a human. It's better. You're a penguin, aren't you? What about me? Sae, you're... What's wrong? No, nothing. Let me borrow it. Kaori, how can I see it on my mine? Rumi taught me how. She knows a lot about this stuff. First, do this and then open this. What? You have to answer a series of questions. Let's say "Yes." - I know your answers very well. - Oh, yeah? Thank you very much. Please drive safely, especially at night. Let's move onto tonight's movie update! After two years, director Matsumura's new movie "MEMORIES"... "MEMORIES" was based on the most brutal indiscriminating murders in Showa's history at a hotel in Gunma... I'm not here right now. Please leave a message after the beep. Hello, this is Producer Yamanaka. Director, how is your screenplay coming along? We've scheduled an audition next week. Thank you. MYSTERIOUS MASS MURDER BY DR. OMORI ELEVEN VICTIMS REVEALING THEIR REAL FACES We'll stay together forever. REINCARNATION Yuuka Karina Kippei Shiina Executive Producers: Kazuya Hamana Yasushi Kotani Associate Producer: Yukie Kito Director of Photography: Takahide Shibanushi Editing by Nobuyuki Takahashi Line Producer: Satoshi Fukushima Music Producer: Tsugunori Yoshida Casting Director: Masashi Yamaguchi Music by Kenji Kawai Written by Takashi Shimizu and Masaki Adachi Produced by Takashige Ichise Directed by Takashi Shimizu SOGEl STUDIOS Well, I don't really like scary movies, but... I would love to play the role of a murder victim. How come? I was killed once in a previous life. Therefore, I could use that experience in my acting. Just a second. A previous life? Yes. It seems like I still have memories from it. Since I was a child, I sometimes remember things I'm not supposed to know. It's probably... because I had experienced those before I was reincarnated. It was a woman. She was probably strangled to death. Therefore, I'm very confident that I could play the role of someone being killed. All right. Is there anyone else? Any questions for the director or whatever? Is there anything further from the director? No. That's it for today. - Thank you for coming. - Thank you very much. NAGISA SUGIURA This isn't a test. You have to get used to it. Yes. You'll still have to go to a lot of auditions after this. The director seemed to glare at me. I have no idea what he was thinking. Don't be afraid of such a little thing. Most directors are like that. Is it going to be a scary movie? Probably. Matsumura is the director, right? It may be a murky story. The genre of the movie doesn't matter. You have to somehow get your name and face known. You have to be aggressive, right? Yokomine, Yokomine. Please exit to the right. Please watch the closing doors. Are you all right? Right here... Are you listening to what I'm saying? I appreciate it. Would you mind if I opened it? NAGISA SUGIURA Crown Pro "MEMORIES" This is it. The director sent it to us directly. I've already read it through. Does that mean I got the part? I'm not sure. I'm calling to check this morning. Why don't you read it? Hello, this is Murakawa from Crown Pro. Can I speak to Mr. Kondo? The director sent it to you directly. It means that you, Nagisa Sugiura, impressed director Matsumura. That must be it! I should be happy, right? Of course. But... I've heard this story somewhere before. Wait, don't you know? This is based on a true incident. At a hotel in some town, a crazy college professor tried to murder his family. But he also killed all the employees and hotel guests who stayed there. He committed suicide at the end. It happened when I was still a child. It was the same year the World Fair took place, so... it was 1970... the 45th year of Showa. But, Nagisa, you weren't even born yet. I know. "MEMORIES" - Thank you. - Thank you for dinner. Please take care. I'm home. "MEMORIES" Who is it? Good morning. You might've noticed when you read the script. This movie is written based on the actual murder case at a hotel. I'll post the details about the case. Please look at them later. I'll let the director take over. My name is Matsumura and I'm the director. Nice meeting you. Well, regarding the case... by the hands of only one man... eleven people were killed. Although the script was written based on the actual incident, the person who committed the crime won't appear in the movie. We will depict it in a way that the murderer exists only in the dark. In other words, we'll focus on the victims rather than the offender. I'd like to make a movie about a group of those eleven victims. It's regretful that they died. They endured to live and feared to die. That's what I wanted to express. By doing so, I think I can let them rest in peace. That's it. I'll announce who we've cast for the roles of the eleven characters. When your name is called, please step forward. Naomi Nagata. Here. You're playing one of the victims as a concierge at the hotel. Yes. Tetta Shinohara. Here. You're playing a desk clerk at the hotel. Okay. Yukihiko Yamaguchi. Here. You're playing the husband of a couple who stayed at the hotel. Yes. I'll do my best. - Yoko Shinjyo. - Here. You're playing the wife in that same couple. All right. Nagisa Sugiura. Nagisa Sugiura. Here. You're playing the role of this girl. She was only six years old at the time it all happened. Along with her 10-year-old brother, they ran around the hotel trying to escape. Both of them were killed by their biological father. We'll change the age of the character in the movie, but she was the last one to get killed among the eleven. This is an important role. All right, Sugiura? Yes. Moving on... - Jyunko Suzuki - Here. The murderer was a college professor. He committed suicide. ELEVEN VICTIMS Gunma Hotel Murders Miyakawa, are you there? Yes. This is amazing. This is a miniature model of the hotel. We'll actually build the set here in these studios. We've made this based on photos of the actual hotel and some other sources. This is the exterior of the hotel. And this is the interior. Please look very carefully. Wow. It's amazing. We'll build the set identical to the real place as it existed then. ELEVEN VICTIMS Yuya 10 years old Chisato 6 years old MASS MURDERER OMORI You're the one who wanted to take this class together. Actually, you may have heard it from someone in the past, or gathered the information from a book you've read. It becomes so lost and confused that you would forget it. It will unconsciously appear again in a different form. Most cases are like that. And this is called... "cryptomnesia phenomenon." This particular symptom is often linked to the term "past life," or the concepts of "reincarnation" and "transmigration." As for the religious and the moralists, they use it as convenient material to prove their own religious beliefs. It's finally over. I'm having the same dream over and over lately. That happens to everyone. No, no. Your dream is about me? Sorry. It's not. The same hotel appears in my dream, but I've never been there before. You know what? Didn't you listen to the lecture? Isn't it, what... crypto... crypto... Listen, let me finish! There is a triangle-shaped red roof like this. The walls and the hallways felt so real. I bet you've been there. You just don't remember. Maybe when you were a child? When I looked at my old album, but I didn't see any photos like that. I asked my parents, but they didn't know where it was. Really? When I told my parents about it, my mom looked surprised and said, "Are you still having that dream?" What? When I was a child, I really wanted to go to the hotel in my dream. Stop talking about the dream! Let's go eat. I'm hungry. Stop right there. Please listen very carefully. - I will. - Don't answer me back! Concentrate! Slowly. The director uses her a lot. She was unknown and got cast for the starring role. She was cast first. Did you hear? - We're going to the real hotel. - Huh? You mean where that incident happened? I thought only crew would go there to do research for the set, but my agent just got the call. Really? How come we have to go? I don't want to go to the murder location. You may get killed! You don't hear the footsteps anymore. Hold your breath. Disappear into the atmosphere. If you're found, you'll get killed. Cut! Okay. It's good. Are you okay? Sugiura, are you okay? - Director! - What happened? Sugiura. Are you all right? Sugiura! I understand you don't want to go to the murder location, but the director wants to take the main cast to the hotel. L... I don't feel that I should go to that hotel. How come all of sudden? Something's wrong. Since I've received the script, strange things have started happening to me. What kind of strange things? The hotel appears in my dreams. And that girl... I didn't know anything, but... Wait. You've read the article about the girl killed by her father. I know that girl... Calm down a bit! Don't you think it's strange? I've seen that girl's face. Wait. Her memories went inside me. Nagisa! Please stop doing this, huh? So, if... even if you are the reincarnation of that girl, it doesn't mean you'll get killed at the same hotel. That's... You understand that this movie is a big chance for you, right? Everybody, thank you for enduring the long trip. We've arrived at the location. What are you doing? I'm sorry. Ouch! Are you all right? Let me do it. They didn't have to lock up that hard. I'm fine. Director, please come in. Please watch your head. Be careful. Please be careful. - Open the door over there. - Okay. We are coming in. I opened it. Everybody, please come in. This way, please. Please watch your step. Please come in. Everyone, please gather. Please come over here. First of all, here it is. - Shinohara! - Yes? Lie down here with your head pointing that way. Turn your face this way. Your arm should lay something like this. - Listen to me. - Okay. The desk clerk was actually dead right here. Everyone... please don't forget what you saw, touched and felt here. - All right? - Okay. Let's talk about... just a second. Don't move. Please watch your step. Suzuki! Please come over here. Please sit down. Turn your face this way, and your legs hanging this way. Please just pretend. Your clothes will get dirty. - Yamaguchi! - Yes? Your face is that way. Lie on your back. Yes. Watch the floor. Please pretend it. Will you shut up?! Yes. What did you come here for? We are here because I want everyone to feel it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. All right. Let's do it. All right. After he falls down the stairs, I want his close up. And then, use the handheld... Excuse me. Don't move. Are you all right? Do you feel sick? I'm fine. Sorry. But you look pale. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. Kondo? What's going on? Please watch your step. Did you see Nagisa? - Nagisa isn't back yet? - What? What happened? I was waiting for her in front of the restroom. She's gone. She's gone? What are you doing? We're looking for her downstairs, too. - Where is the restroom? - Downstairs. Sugiura... Please. Isn't this room... The girl you're to playing... was killed here. You seem very intuitive. She's really running late. I didn't expect you to know someone like that. What? You said you wanted to meet her, right? It might be good material for my research paper. No way. The professor's lecture is about proving the opposite theory. Why do you even want to meet Miss Mysterious? "Miss Mysterious"? How come you're friends with Miss Mysterious? We're not that good of friends. When, where and how did you guys meet? Tell me, tell me. We're just friends. I'm not going to introduce her to you. There. She looks pretty cute. She's studying to become an actress. Really? I'm sorry. Were you waiting long? Not at all. Thanks for coming. Not at all. Your college looks huge. Oh, yeah. It's very nice. There are a lot on campus. This is Kinoshita. Yayoi Kinoshita. This is Morita. - Hi. - Hi. Let's go inside. What is it? Have we met somewhere before? I don't think so. Oh, I see. I'm sorry. That might be from my previous... Your previous? Your previous life, isn't it? I bet we've met somewhere before. Really? Does that happen to you very often? Well... you know, sometimes... you seem to know the place even though you've never been there before. It's deja vu, isn't it? - That happens to me too. - Of course. That happens to everybody, but... you just can't remember. The truth is, you, Kazuya, unconsciously... How can you tell the difference between your memories at present and those before you were born? It's easy. Do some research. Research? Yayoi, you have something you want to find out, don't you? You know, let's go together. Go together? Let's go. Thank you for today and for lunch. What? Wait. For the safety of this shoot and the success of "MEMORIES," let's give our prayers. Producer Koji Yamanaka. 11 LIVES ARE TAKEN Here. This person was me in my previous life. It was in the 45th year of Showa. It was 35 years ago. Look here. This says that she was strangled to death. Look. Doesn't it hurt? Not at all. I was born with it. It was much lighter before. It has become much darker recently. It's not good for an actress. So, where is this hotel? Oh. Well, I saw the photo somewhere. Hello? Hello. It's me. Can we talk now? Just a second. I saw the photo towards front page. Sorry. I'm in the library now. - Shall I call you back? - No. It's not that important, but... the other day... ELEVEN WERE KILLED The murderer, a college professor, committed suicide. Omori's wife, Ayumi, is unconscious and in serious Condition. Ayumi regains consciousness. I'm sorry. Some books fell. Yuka. Yuka? I'm going to hang up. See you. Yuka? Yuka? Yuka? We'll stay together forever. We'll stay together forever. We'll stay together forever. - Where is it? - Over there. Director, why did you want to make a movie about this incident? Why do you ask? Lately, I feel strange. I felt it when we went to the hotel. Why did you want me to play that girl's role? Why? Because you were in that room then. This is to be used for the movie. One of the victims' family let me borrow it. The girl you're playing... was holding this doll when she got killed. This must have a soul of regret. I want you to think deeply of that girl when she was killed as she held this doll. They left me as the Ione survivor. I'm praying for them every day. However, those children have not... found peace yet. That's what I feel. Here you are. When that incident happened... l... I don't know what to say. The hotel in that photo is... Before that tragedy occurred. That's the hotel they stayed at on their only family trip. L... I have something to show you. I drew it when I was a child. Have you been there? I have never been there before. But I used to have dreams about this house over and over. That man left this. It's said in many newspapers that Professor Omori was crazy. I thought so, too. No, I wanted to think that way... but I understood after I read the notebook again and again. That man was not crazy. The human body is just a vessel. "The human body is just a vessel." Somehow he got off the track from his specialty field. Where do humans come from? Where do they go? Will our memories and thoughts disappear when our bodies are dead? He was studying that subject very seriously. Excuse me, is there a guest named Omori staying at this hotel? - May I? - I'm his wife! Please. - Here it is. - Thank you. I'll see you again. Yuya! Chisato! We'll stay together forever. I wonder if he was experimenting with them. The human body is just a vessel. The crane is coming in. Please be careful. Please make room to come through. All right. We're about to start shooting. That film you asked me for is ready. I had a hard time getting it. I was running around. Where did you get it? Nagisa? Thank you. Are you okay? Oh. And then, what do you want to do with this? What's it about? I don't know. What? You should... Yes? Excuse me. Thank you for waiting. Please get ready for wardrobe. All right. - Please take care. - Take care. Hello, it's me. It's about Yuka Morita who you met the other day. Her family contacted me and said she hasn't come home since then. If you know anything, please call me. Bye. Be cautious of what's behind you, too. Sometime, you stumble. That's it. You can breathe hard. You'll trip over right there. That's it. Stay there for a while. Slowly look forward and get up. It's like you are sucked in. Good. As you're stumbling... you still watch behind you. Yeah, this side, too. That's a dead end. Be aware of your right first. That's it. And, then turn left. Quickly. - Good. - That's a cut! - I want one long take. - All right. It may be possible if we remove the ceiling and walls in the corner. Go in the back. Remove the ceiling and walls. - All right? - Yeah. This is it. Well, it's an 8mm film. I have a faint memory of these. Do they still use them? Can I take a look at it? Kanko Hotel. Yuka! Yuka! Yuka, what's wrong? Yuka, what happened? Yuka? Cut! That's a cut. Sugiura, this will be a take. Yes. Let's roll it. We can do it. Let's shoot it. Let's do it. This is a take! Please stand by. - Please get a chair. - Yes. Imai! Imai! Are you ready? Yes! Yuka. We'll stay together forever. Thank you for waiting. Let's shoot. Picture's up! This is a take! Ready! Action! We'll stab each other. Nagisa. We'll stay together forever. We'll stay together forever.
