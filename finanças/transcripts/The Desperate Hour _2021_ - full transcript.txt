Your breath is all you need. Focus on it, letting each breath bring you closer to a place of peace and restoration. Picture yourself somewhere you wish to be, some place from the life you shared. Feel the warmth it creates, the memories it provokes, the wholeness it brings. We can't undo the past, and the future remains unknown, leaving us only with each new day. Adjusting to a new reality takes time. It is a process, as unique as every - Have a good day! Noah! Noah, come on, wake up! Come on! You're going to be late. I'm sick. I made you some coffee.

We were, but Nancy called, and she wants to have a celebration of Peter's life tomorrow. Oh. Okay. I think it would be good for you to be around other people. Yeah, sure it would be, but I just, I don't know how the kids feel. You know, does this set them back? It'll be good for them, Amy. Okay, then. Well, just think about it, honey. Yeah. Just think about it. Yeah, I will. You can always leave early. Okay, listen mom, I have to go. Ask her about the car. What? The car. Oh, right. Can you pick up the car for us at Reliable Auto Body?

Reminder, wall guy, 10 a.m. to noon. Oh. What, is Wednesday no good for you? No, I... Sorry, I've just got this guy coming over to fix my wall. What happened to it? Noah punched a hole in it. Oh God. Mackenzie said some kids have been little dicks to him lately. Well, she didn't use that word, but she said they've been mean. Yeah, it's those toxic apps. They're awful to each other. No honey, actually she said this was at school. Oh, there too. Great. See, he doesn't, he doesn't tell me anything. Look, I just want to make sure you're all doing okay, you know, with the anniversary... Or, er... I don't, I don't... I don't know what the right word is. I just, you know. So, this is why you're FaceTiming me? Yes! I'm worried about you. Is he opening up at all? Ugh, I don't know. I just feel like I don't know him anymore. It's just been a hard year. I know. I know it has. But you know, it's really important you talk to him. Yeah, I try. I just honestly think he hates me. Stop. You know that's not true. Spend a day in my house and try telling me that. I could use a day away from Bob, don't tempt me. Anyway, point is Noah loves you, even if he only ever seldom says it to you. Very seldom. Whatever he does, that's never changing. You know why? 'Cause you're a great mom, okay? Okay. Okay. Oh, don't forget about Wednesday. You, me, and Susan. And wine. Thanks, Heather. Of course. Bye. Bye. Siri, do not disturb. Okay, do not disturb turned on. Hey, it's me. I'm still at work. I'm just thinking about you, that's all. Thinking I'd try you, no biggie. Oh, I was going to pick up a pizza on the way home for the kids for while you and I are at dinner. And speaking of which, I made a reservation for 8:30. That's not too late, right? I'm sort of the fence between 7 and 7:30, but neither were available, so... Anyway, I'm rambling. If you talk to Noah, ask him to text me what he and Emily want on their pizza, okay? I gotta go. Bye.

Listen, I have Detective Paulson from Lakewood PD on the line for you, okay? Go ahead, Detective. Mrs. Carr, this is Detective Ed Paulson. There's been a new development. I need you to pay attention to what I'm about to ask you, and I need you to tell me the truth, understand? Yes. I have some questions about your son, Noah. Where is he? He's still in the building. What does that mean? Unfortunately, that's all I can tell you at this point. What does that mean? I just have some questions I need to ask you, Mrs. Carr. Is he okay? Is he alive? We believe he is, yes. You believe? Can I ask you a couple of questions, Mrs. Carr? Okay. Do you keep any firearms in the house? What? Guns. Do you keep any guns in your home? A couple rifles. They used to go hunting together. And where do you keep those? Downstairs in the basement. And are these hunting rifles secure? They're locked up with a code. And does your son know the code, Mrs. Carr? No. I don't think so. Just hunting rifles in the basement, no high capacity, or assault weapons, or - No. To the best of your knowledge, has he ordered anything from a gun retailer recently, Mrs. Carr? No. I need to know if my son's okay. Do you think he could have received an order without you noticing, like ammunition? No. Holsters? No. Why, why are you asking me these questions? Does Noah take any prescription medications? Mrs. Carr? You there? Are you still there, Amy? Mrs. Carr? Lexapro. Okay. Just ten milligrams. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior lately? He's been upset. How long do you think he's been feeling upset? Since last year. Can you say why? His father passed away. How long ago did his father... A year ago. A year ago today? No, it's Sunday. Ah. Thank you, Mrs. Carr. If you hear anything from Noah, call 911 immediately, and asked to be patched in directly to my cell, okay? Thanks very much. We know among those, students say at least one of them is a teacher, and we heard from somebody talking about a teacher who protected the rest of their class. Alright, Susanna. And I want to jump in. We have confirmation, that female victim has just died. Oh. As a result of her injuries. We have one fatality in this situation, a female who was actually being treated at Lakewood Hospital. We are now getting word that she has passed from her injuries. It's just the worst, worst fear when we cover stories like this. You hear about people being... One person was shot in the leg, we heard from a student out there, but to hear that somebody lost their life, is just devastating, especially if you're a parent who can't get in touch with your daughter. Very difficult situation, and extremely heartbreaking to hear again, that is one female victim has been pronounced dead from her - My dad is dead. Two days ago he was here, and now... How am I supposed to accept that a car accident took him away? Dad, I love you, and I miss you so much. It's Noah. Please leave a message. Noah, it's me. Listen, the police... The police are saying something awful, and I, I don't want to believe them, but I can't stop thinking... I know you miss him. I know. I know I made you angry about so many things. And I'm sorry. But I love you, honey, and I want to help you. Please let me help you, Noah. I want to do better with you. So, if what they're saying is true... I want you to stop. Please stop, Noah. If you're hearing this, please stop. Please pick up Emily from school who you land. Mrs. Carr? Hello? Hello? Your number came up. Everything's still okay here. The superintendent said that parents can pick the students up after six o'clock. Everyone's in the gymnasium, and everyone is okay. Okay? Right, okay, yeah. Everything's okay. That's why I was calling. I, uh... Hello? Can I speak to Emily? Is that okay? Sure, of course. Hang on a second, let me get her. Can you get Emily? Come here. It's your mama. Come on. There you go. Hello? Hi, sweetie. Hi, mama. You okay? Uh, yeah. Good, good. Listen, I don't think I can get there to pick you up, but Grammy's going to come, okay? She might be a little late. Mom, where are you going to be? I'm not sure. What's happening at Noah's school? Shh. I'm trying to find out. I'm trying to find out. Okay? Is he okay? Mama? He's, your brother's... I'm going to him right now, okay? Okay. Okay. Can you, can you put Ms. Fisher back on, please? Okay. I love you, mama. I love you. Here, Ms. Fisher. Hello? Mrs. Carr? Hi, so my mother, she's flying in. She should be there - Okay. Pick up around six, seven, maybe later. I don't know. Don't worry, we'll be here. Don't worry, okay? Whatever you need, Mrs. Carr. We've got you. Thank you. Oh God. This is so horrible. I can't even believe this is happening. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Be safe. Reliable Auto Body. Hello? Hey, it's CJ again. CJ? Yeah. What's that, what's that noise? What's happening? I was finally able to step outside. Listen, I don't know what's going on, but the cops are searching more cars. Why? I don't know, but they're doing it. I see one, two, they're searching four more cars. They've got the dogs sniffing them too, just like with your son's pick up. Okay. Okay, you call me back if you see anything else? I will. Yeah, that's great. Thanks, CJ. Hello? Heather! Amy? We're on our way to the hospital. Oh my God, is Mackenzie okay? Oh no, she's okay. She got out. Okay, did you talk to her? Just for a minute. She dropped her phone when she was running. Did she say anything about Noah? No, I don't... I don't know. You don't know? You haven't talked to him? Or you don't know? I don't know, Amy. She was so upset. I didn't get a chance to ask her anything. Okay, okay, okay. Just call me back as soon as you hear anything, please. Of course, I will. I'm sorry, I will. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Noah! Help. Sweetie, are you okay? I hear you. Are you okay? I'm here. I'm here. Tell me what's going on. He's here. Who's here? What? He's here. Noah, Noah, don't! Shit! Oh my God! It's Noah. Please leave a message. I lost you, what's happening? Tell me! Call me back! It's Noah. Please leave a message. I'm coming, coming to get you. Oh, come on. Oh God. Oh! 911, what is your emergency? Hello? Mrs. Carr? Yeah. It's Dedra Wilkinson. Yeah, I spoke to him. Okay. I spoke to my son. What did he say to you? What did he say? He said, I don't know, he sounded scared. He was still inside. Okay. And he said someone's here, or coming. I don't know. Did he say who? Did he say who was coming? It was, "He's here." That's what he said. I'm transferring you to Detective Paulson. Hold, please. Okay. Mrs. Carr? What the hell is happening? Please, tell me something. Your son called you? He said, "He's here." Okay, did he say anything else? It's not him, is it? I'm on with one of the parents now. Did you... What? Why did you search his truck? We searched his truck before we confirmed the suspect's identity. Right, but you searched four more cars after, didn't you? I need you to listen. Yes, we did, Mrs. Carr. It's not my son, is it? That's what I'm trying to tell you! Can you just listen to me for a minute, please, Mrs. Carr? Okay. Your son is not the shooter, okay? It's not your son. He's not the shooter. Why, why did you make me think that? I can assure you that wasn't my intention, Mrs. Carr. Why did you ask me all those things? Because I had to. He's still inside the building, and I had to let you know. Then get him out. We're working on that right now, ma'am. You got other kids out, why can't you get mine out? Mrs. Carr, look, there are five people barricaded in the school's chemistry lab. Your son is one of them, and so is the suspect, alright? We have to be very careful. Who is he? The suspect? I can't tell you that. Well, have you spoken to him? I haven't personally, but the Sheriffs Department negotiation team has, and the longer we can maintain contact with him, the better our chances. Is he a student? I can't tell you that either. Look, Mrs. Carr, I understand that you want - At least tell me that much. I - If he's a student, at least let me think he has a fighting chance against him. Please, Mrs. Carr. Look, he's not a student, okay? Then who is he? Why is he doing this? We're working as fast as we can to try to figure out - How does someone like that have so many guns? I don't know, but he's got them. Then tell me what you do know. Our negotiator's in contact with him, I told you that. We're doing everything - Yeah, well, he doesn't have your negotiator's son, does he? He has mine, and an AR fucking 15 weapon, and whatever else you said. Do something about it! Mrs. Carr, we're doing everything in our power to get your son out safely. If he calls you again - Wait! You said, you said he has five, there are five people in the lab, right? You said that. Five people, yes, including the suspect. Reliable Auto Body. CJ, it's Amy.

Yes, it's Amy, but I - No, I mean in the grey sweatshirt, is that you? Yes! Yes, that's me! Please, let's go, fast! Destination, Lakewood High School. Estimated arrival, 15 minutes. Come on, Greg. One, two, three. Maybe ten. Ten. Is that enough? Will you listen then? And that, that place, the school, it's just there. That's it, that's why. I remember them laughing, like I didn't know, like I wasn't there or something. I'm sick of waiting. After today, you'll listen. And once you see, you'll listen. Hello? Are you there? Robert? Who is this? My name's Amy Carr. Are you the police? No, I am not the police. They keep calling me. They called me too. Why? Because my son is there with you. They thought he was the one doing this. Is he okay? You're lying, you're the police. No, I swear I'm not the police. Then who are you? I'm his mom, and I'm worried. He's a good boy. He's a good kid, all of them, they're good kids. Now, I know, I know you're angry and scared, and hurting, but none of this is going to make it any better. I want this to stop. I want it to stop too. Tell me how I can help you. Tell me what I can do. Shit! Shit! The mailbox is full, and cannot accept any messages - Shit! Come on. The mailbox is full - Shit! - and cannot accept any messages. Come on. Mom, Mom, I don't have long. You're lying. You're the police. I hope this isn't the last time I'll be able to say it to you, but I love you. Who are you? Please, save this video if anything happens to me. Excuse me, miss. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. No caller ID. Hello? This is Detective Paulson. How'd you get that number? I, uh... You just put all those kids at risk. Your kid! He worked at the cafeteria. Do you know him? No, no, Then how'd you get the number? Mrs. Carr, how did you get his number? Does that matter right now? It matters if you're not telling me something, if you're providing him assistance. You heard me on the call. Did it sound like I was assisting him? Listen to me, I want you to listen to me very carefully, Mrs. Carr. Do not call him again, okay? He says it wants it to stop. Not the way you think he does. Please, let us do our jobs. He has my son. That's right. And the likelihood of us getting him out of there safely just got a lot more complicated. Please, do not interfere, Mrs. Carr. No more calls. You're seeing SWAT moving in now, into the building. There's something definitely happening. On the Sky Cam, Danny. SWAT's there, SWAT is inside the high school, moving in what appears to be some sort of tactical formation. Now, I'm told that the governor has offered Lakewood PD assistance from the National Guard. It seems a terrible day is finally reaching some - Excuse me, do you have a charger for an iPhone? Sorry, just an Android. 911, what is your emergency? Yes, can I speak with Dedra Wilkinson, please? Mrs. Carr? Is that you, Amy? Hey. Yes, hello, it's me. Hi. Hi. You okay? How are you holding up? Not great. Are you still on the road? Yeah, but I'm in a car now. That's good. What can I help you with? Just didn't want to be alone. I understand. I'm here if you need me to be. How is this happening? You've just got to hang in there. You've been staying so strong. I have, but I'm not. I'm not. You are, Amy. You're doing everything you need to be doing for your son. No, I'm barely holding on. I shouldn't have made him go. I shouldn't. Listen, this is not your fault, Amy. Yeah, it's mine. I should have just let him stay home, and left him alone. You did what any other mom would do. You got your son up when he couldn't get up on his own. You got him on his feet, and made sure he got to where he needed to be. Because he's your child, and because you love him. Simple as that. You didn't know today was going to be like this. Nobody did. That's my point. And he knows that, Mrs. Carr. He's not blaming you. He's holding on to you right now. He's holding on to that love. I might just be a voice on the other end of this line, but I'm here for you. I'm praying for you, Mrs. Carr. For you and everyone else. Thank you. You're welcome. Amy, are you still there? Oh God. I think it's the detective calling. I'll let you go. But... You have to take that call, Mrs. Carr. Will you stay on the line? Yes, yes, now answer. I promise I'll stay on the line, just please, answer the call. Oh God, okay. Are you still there? I am. Who's that? It's Dedra Wilkinson, Detective. I'm the 911 dispatcher you spoke with before. Please, just... Mrs. Carr, the suspect has cut off contact with us. What does that mean? Is he okay, my son? We don't know. I have Sargent Brant from the crisis negotiation unit on the line. Mrs. Carr? Oh God. I'm sorry, I didn't mean, I didn't mean to make things worse, I was just trying to reach him. I understand. I understand that, and I wouldn't characterize it that way at all. Why is this happening? Why is he doing this? We don't know. But I do know he's in possession of multiple firearms, and he's demonstrated a willingness to use them. Like Detective Paulson said, we've lost communication with the suspect, and we're running out of time. We need your help. Yeah, yeah, sure. You were able to make contact with the suspect, and you were able to remain on the line with him. For like ten seconds. Which is ten seconds longer than what we're getting out of him now. No, no. We're not asking you to play negotiator, not at all. Okay, we just need to you to distract him long enough for SWAT to reach the chemistry lab. What if I say the wrong thing? We'll guide you through all of it, okay? We're going to tell you what to say. No, I could say something that makes it - It's okay, Amy. It's okay. If we're doing this, we have to go now. Do you have access to a second phone line, Mrs. Carr? No, I, I don't have another phone, I'm in a car. Hey, here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. Mrs. Carr, did you get another phone? Yeah. Okay, stand by. Okay. We're going to connect you to Robert. Okay, we'll be listening in, and here on the other line if you need us, alright? SWAT team is standing by at the north end of the school. He's not picking up. He might have put down his phone. Just don't hang up. Robert. Hello? Hello, it's Amy Carr. She's on with him now. You're the one who called before? Yes, that's right. Alright, now ask him if he's okay. Is everything, is everything okay, Robert? Are you okay? Do you need medical help? No. Ask about the students now. Does anyone... Is everyone else okay? Not everyone. Victim reported, we've got a possible casualty. Listen, Robert, I'm very worried about my son. Is he okay? Is that him? Is that Noah? Please tell me. Try to respond to what Robert is saying to you. Robert, is he still with you? Yes. Don't draw attention to your son. Focus on the suspect. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, God. They keep moving. I told them, no moving. Who's moving, Robert? Stay with me, stay with me. You need to listen. All of you, no more moving! Just keep him calm. Tell him you can help. Listen! I want to help you. SWAT has entered the east wing. Oh my God, please hurry, please hurry. Who were you talking to? What? Who are you talking to? You, you. I'm talking to you, Robert. I'm talking to you. Can you hear me? I hear people coming. You're a liar! You're the police! What? Who's... No! I'm not the police. Who's out there? Who's out there? I swear, I'm not the police. Okay, just keep him engaged. We need some more time. Hey! Where's the other kid? The kid with the brown hair? SWAT team have reached the forth floor. Where did he go?! Tell me where he is! Shit! Amy, you need to call him back. Oh my God. Stand down. We lost him. SWAT, stand down, we have lost engagement with the suspect. The mailbox is full, and cannot accept any messages. Shit! Mrs. Carr, did we lose you? No, I'm here. Oh my God! Oh my God, he's calling. Is the shooter calling you, Mrs. Carr? No, it's Noah. He's FaceTiming me. Mrs. Carr, is your son with the shooter? Noah! Honey, are you okay? Noah? Mom, it's me. I can't see you. I can hear you though. Where are you? I got away. I'm hiding in the French room. Okay, I'm coming to get you. I'm coming to get you, honey. You stay where you are. I love you, baby. I love you too. I love you so much. Get SWAT in there now! The police are coming, okay? We're going to get you out. Where's the other kid? Tell me where he is. I'm scared. I'm here. I'm here, I'm here, baby. Tell me where he is! Okay, okay, I'm sorry! What's happening? Oh my God! What's happening? SWAT's breaching the chemistry lab. Oh my God! No! They're going to the wrong room! The French classroom! They're not in the chemistry lab! Order them down, now. Please, hurry up! Next room, now! No! Noah! Oh my God! I'm coming! No! Ma'am! Stand back. Everybody, stay back. Stand by, stand by. We've got more people coming out. We've got more coming out. Noah! Noah! Noah! Mom! Noah! Mom! Noah! Mom! Noah! Okay, are you okay? Oh my God. I love you, I love you. Hi, this is Amy. Leave a message, I'll get back to you. Mrs. Carr, it's Detective Paulson. I was told that you and your son were reunited, and I'm really glad to hear that. I also wanted to thank you. I know what we asked you to do wasn't easy, but... You were great. Amy, it's Greg. I just wanted to check back in. I hope your son's okay, and you're okay too. We just landed, and heard what's going on. Is Noah alright, is he with you? We're on our way to pick up Emily - Hey, Mrs. Carr, it's CJ. I hope you and your son got reunited, and you know, your parents' car is ready whenever you want - Hey, it's Heather. I am so glad that Noah's okay, and you're all home safe. We love you guys, and we're here if you need us for anything. Come by, call me. Whatever you want, I'm here. I hope you're holding each other a little tighter today. I know we are. I love you. Bye. Thank you, Mom. Love you, hon. There's pancakes when you're ready. A moment too horrific and too tragic has unfortunately happened again. Former graduate of Lakewood High School, Robert Ellis, stormed the school Friday morning, taking hostages for several hours before a SWAT team was able to free a group of students held captive in a second floor classroom. I just, I saw kids running, and I was running too, and then Ms. Dwyer told us to go into a classroom and turn off the lights like we practiced. But we just heard more shots. And we were afraid he was going to shoot through the door, but he just kept going. So, we started to run away, and we just ran... Hey, it's me, Noah. Day 100 of doing this, posting this. Day I think 107 since what happened at my school, our school, if... Yeah, you know. Hearing a lot of what you've had to say, it's inspired me to keep doing this, to stand up. Today seems kind of like a milestone, I guess. A hundred days of these videos. A lot's changed in that time. For me, my life feels like things are finally starting to get better. It's not gone, it'll never be gone. I want to keep active, I want to keep talking to everybody because this has to stop. It should have stopped before. Kids shouldn't have to go to school and worry about this happening to them. And that's why I'm going to keep doing whatever I can to help, you know. 'Cause I know some of you can't. And I'm going to keep talking about how wrong this is because there's no other way to say it. And that's why I won't stay quiet, and I hope you won't either.
