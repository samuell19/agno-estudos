Hope you enjoy your stay in Paris. Good-bye. Thank you very much. The departure to Athens and Tel Aviv, on flight 242, is scheduled at air run 25. Boarding expected at air run 5, gate #45. Who are you? What do you want? Move. Here. Okay. Give me the bag. Give me the other one. Yeah. Now, are you frightened? All right, let me see if I can make you understand this. We, all of us, we are professional criminals. And we're holding you for a short period of time... and your father will give us a sum of money. Yes? When he pays us the sum of money, you will be returned. No harm will come to you. You understand? Nothing bad... nothing bad is gonna happen to you here. Because if anything bad happened to you, uh, something much worse would happen to us, and we don't want that. You understand? Now, while you're here, you must not go outside. We are not concerned with hurting you. All right? All right, now, would you like to say hello to your daddy? You all right, Sis? I'm fine. Take it easy now. I'll see ya tonight. Come on, Bud. She'll be all right. Let's go. She'll be all right. Come on. After finding the chauffeur tied and gagged, authorities checked the flight's passenger list with customs officials... and airport personnel. The young woman had, indeed, been on Flight 713, gone through customs and had been seen leaving the airport... in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce, all of which establishes kidnapping beyond any shadow of doubt. I'm really sorry to do this to you. I hope you understand that. Je vous ai fait peur, hein.! Je suis desole. Je vous ai fait peur. Oh! No. Uh, Ce n'est... rien. Oh, you're English. Uh, no. American? Yes. I speak a little English. I'm sorry I frightened you. Oh. Oh, no. Are you lost? I'll help you. Oh, no, no. No, thanks. Uh... I live here. Oh, I didn't know the house was rented. We just arrived, my husband and I. He's, uh, he's not too well, and we've come for the ocean air. Oh, I'm sorry. I hope he will feel better here. Thanks. Probably we'll see each other again, then. I hope. Good-bye. Hello? May I speak to the master of the house, please? - Who is this? - Tell him it's a friend of his daughter's. Hello. Who is this? Just a minute, please. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Hello? Look, this is going to be a one-way conversation. I'm not gonna be able to hear you, but that's not important, but what is important is that you listen. You understand? Just listen. Father, I'm all right. Don't worry, please. They want me to say that if you follow their instructions, nothing will happen to me. - Hey! - Oh.! Oh. Ah! Did I hurt you? That must hurt terribly. Really, I'm awfully sorry. That should feel better. Okay, you're gonna meet us tomorrow night. Right. Now here's ten. You get the rest when you get us to Portugal. Right. Now you got that straight? That's half pay. You get the rest... Your sister's freezin' her buns off. Let's go. Where is she? There she is. It's a cop. Erase the tape? No. Great. Bonsoir, messieurs. Vous etes presses? Uh, no, m... Merci, monsieur I'agent. Nous attendons pour quelque d'autre. You are Americans? Oh, you speak English. Yes. Ah, well, we were waiting for someone to pick us up. We mistook you for somebody else. I guess our party's a little late. Oh. Where are you going? Perhaps I can take you there. Well... Thank you. Oh. Get in! Thank you. Where you go? Well, we're going to the, uh, the Villa Vive. It's about a mile on the other side of town. Oh, yes. I know the house. I met your friend this afternoon. The wife. On my coming back from fishing. Oh, really? They were supposed to pick us up. Perhaps he's worse and they could not come. What a pity, huh? Such a beautiful woman. - He's much older than she, no? - Uh, I don't know. I guess, uh, a little. Mm-hmm. You are a doctor, huh? Yes. Well, here you are. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Oh, by the way. If you like fishing, there, on the other side of thejetty, it is one of the best places of the region. Oh, really? Well, we'll have to try it. Thanks very much for the ride. Well, what happened, man? Where is she? Who? Vi. She wasn't at the airport. You don't know, huh? That's real smart. That's real smart. That's real smart, buddy. Vi? Hey, where were ya? Buddy. We were at the airport waitin'for ya. You were supposed to be at the airport. Where were ya? L... - Are you on? - Oh, no. Let me see your eyes. Look at me. Look at me! Buddy. Did you take a shot? I only had... Oh... oh, Buddy. I wouldn't... I wouldn't do that. You know that. You know, baby. I-I... Baby, I got so nervous. I had... I had such a bad time. I took... I took a sleeping pill. - You what? - I took a sleeping pill. I am freezing. Are you on junk? Oh, no. Oh, baby, listen. I'm... You know I wouldn't do this. I'm... I'm not on junk. I wouldn't... I don't need it anymore. Come on. I love you. I love you so much. Oh, please! Please don't! Please, please! Shut up! What's going on, man? She tried to leave and I stopped her. That's what's goin' on. Please! Shut up! I saw it. I was upstairs, and I saw what you did. You're gonna make a speech, huh? I got other things to take care of. If you wanna... Shut up. Listen to me, man. If you wanna get freaky, you don't do it with her. You make the speech. I'll change my clothes. Come on. Please! I-I... Please! Wally. What's the matter? I think we ought to call it off, man. - What are you talkin' about? - It's turning sour, man. It's coming apart. What do you mean, Bud? It's goin' beautiful. No, listen. Last night after I came home, I went upstairs. You know what I found? Vi, in the bathtub, crashed out of her skull. She's on junk. She's usin' it again. Aw, that's crazy. No. Vi's been straight for months. You oughta know that. You've been with her, haven't ya? She was out of her skull on junk, and she should've been there pickin' us up at the airport. That's a fact. Yeah. Did you talk to her? Of course I talked to her. She said she took a sleeping pill. She was probably telling you the truth. You know how Vi gets all tensed up. So she took a pill. She konked out. That doesn't mean she's gonna cave in when it gets rough. Bud, ya know Vi. She's family. She... Wally! That was a cop. That was a cop last night that took us home here. So what? He's only one of a lot of cops who are gonna be lookin' for us after tonight. No, man, there's not gonna be any tonight, because this genius pimp that you found in Miami, or wherever you got him, is psycho. I hear some racket. I come down. He's rollin' around the floor with the kid, punchin' her, man! Knockin' her around, throwin' her head against the wall. I wanted to smash his face right then. That was the end of the caper. That's it. Okay, okay. Everybody's a little nuts these days. Now, come on, Bud. He'll be all right. He's gonna do his job. What happens if he knocks the kid off? You know what they do in this country if you kill somebody? They chop your head off. They chop your head off! He's not gonna kill the kid. How do you know, man? He was in Paris, sittin' in front of you and me, and he said, "I think we oughta knock the kid off". Right? Yeah, yeah, but, but, but... you and I said, " No good. No rough stuff". Right? And he went along with us, didn't he? Please, listen. This guy is not responsible. He's crazy, Wally. He's, he's, he's psycho. Really. He's, he's not so crazy that he doesn't want to stay alive. We all want to stay alive. Now come on, Bud. Come on. He's my responsibility. I brought him into this and I'll take care of him. You don't understand this kind of an operation. You don't... You don't understand the whole operation, man. Look, this isn't your caper. This isn't your caper. You don't understand. This is, uh... I mean, it's not like stealing oranges, man, or knockin' over a bookstore or kicking a safe in, man. This is something else, man. I know that. You've got international police. You've got publicity. You got millions of people involved. You've got, uh, television, uh, radio, newspapers. They're gonna be lookin' for us like flies lookin' for a piece of dead meat. That's what I mean. It's big! You dumb bastard. You goddamn son of a bitch! I want out of this thing, man! You're crazy! You're gonna get us all killed. I want out of it. This is it, man. No, no, Christ. This is... It's finished, man. You're nuts. You're absolutely nuts. Layin' it into me just like that. Twelve hours before the payoff. Thanks, Bud. Okay, what is it? There isn't gonna be any payoff, Wally. You're gonna get yourself killed. You think that's the worst thing that could happen to me in my life is to be killed? Look at me. I'm fat and 40, Bud. This is it for me. I'm sick of stickin' my hands in people's pockets for a dollar bill or for... I'm sick of it, Bud. I'm goin' all the way this time. Yeah. Okay, if... you want out, okay. I'd be doin' 35 years in Sing Sing right now if it weren't for you, man. Aw, that's all right. Wait a minute. That's what it is. But, Wally, there aren't gonna be any rainbows, man. I don't know, Bud. You know, the funny thing is that kid up there is gonna identify us anyway. Once she puts the finger on us, I'd just like to have a little car fare, that's all. Wouldn't you? Okay, man. Let's go the route. Come here a minute. Come on in. Let me run and give this to her. Sit down. What do you want, sweetheart? I just wanted to know where you were last night. I was here. Well, I know that. I mean, but you weren't here. So where were you? Where do you think I was? I was talking to your brother Wally. You talked to my brother until 6:00 in the morning? Oh, no, we... I went down to the whorehouse first, and then, uh, we had a lot of girls downstairs, had some beers and... Oh, I see. Which whorehouse? The one across the hall? I don't know. Liar! Don't you hit me! You... What the hell's the matter with you? Don't you... Look, kid. Listen, I'm gonna break your... Don't you touch me! I'm not the one who wasn't here! I didn't go to the other bedroom! Now shut up! Damn it! Oh! You beast! You bastard! Sis, what's the matter? I'll kill you! You're through, you dumb bitch. You've had it. I've had it? Yeah. You're finished. I am so... You've had it! You wanna know why? Because I'm leaving! Bud. Five years! You know how she is. Come on. I've had it. What the hell's the matter with you? I'm not gonna do it, man, so forget it. Forget it. Forget it! But you're the only... Leave me alone. Jesus Christ, will ya? But you're the only one who can talk to her. Please, Bud, please. Don't make me get on my knees to ya. We're ten hours away. Please, Bud. All right! Shut up. All right, listen, I'm gonna cool her this time. But, Wally, when we get to Portugal, she's your sister and she's just another cheap broad to me. Because I've had it. I've had it with her. I have had all those scenes that I'm gonna take, and this is it. I don't want any more. Right? You lying son of a bitch. Don't you get near me with that. Don't... Don't you get... Don't you... Vi, I love you. I've never loved anybody else, and I'm sorry I hurt you. Go ahead and cut. Go ahead. Go ahead and cut my face if that's what you feel like. I deserve it. Sweetheart. I love you, baby, and I wasn't... I didn't do anything with that kid. Really? Believe me. I didn't, baby. I didn't. I didn't, sweetheart. Don't let anything happen to my little girl, hmm? Mademoiselle. Uh, bonjour. Uh, un Scotch, s'il vous plait. Un Scotch. Bonjour. Vous etes. Ca va. Il certain? Bonjour. - Bonjour. - You see? We meet again. - Yes. - What a day, huh? Terrible. How is your husband? I drive the doctor to your house last night. Oh, yes, that's right. Yes, he told me. Uh, thank you. He's much better. Oh, that's good. Excuse-moi, donne-moi I'americain. Oui. Pas de tout. Merci. Well, off to work. Ya hungry? Is there something wrong? Is there something wrong? My windshield wipers. They stopped working. Ah. Let me see. Open the hood. Try it now. Very good. It was a bad contact... uh, connection? Well, thank you very much. You be careful driving because of the rain. The road is dangerous. Au revoir. Au revoir. The cafe? And then on the road? And all of those questions? I don't like it! He's just a hick cop tryin' to get a little nookie. Wants to pinch-hit for your sick husband. My husband? Who is my husband? All he saw was a friend and a doctor that came to see my husband by plane. Now if that doesn't seem strange, I don't know what does. Oh, listen. Shut up. If it was a cop and if he was suspicious, he'd knock on the door... and that'd be the end of it, so just cool it. Come on. Hey, turn on the telly. We may miss the news. Whoever you are and wherever you are, if you can hear me now, I want to repeat... that I will meet your ransom demands. But please, please don't hurt my daughter. You'll see him tonight, kid. - What are you doing here? - I am sorry to be the bearer of sad tidings. You won't be picking us up. The flight's cancelled. - What? - The flight's cancelled. What are you talkin' about, the flight... Where are Wally and Bud? I made my deal with Wally and Bud. Al, you're not listening, not paying attention to me. The flight is cancelled! You will now proceed as follows. "When you open this letter, you should have the money with you, in a cab, "headed toward the Hotel George V... "and be very willing to cooperate with us. "First, you are not going to the Hotel George V. "You are going to take the subway. "You will ask the driver to take you to the Franklin Roosevelt Subway Station, "from where you will take the enclosed luggage stub... "to the baggage counter at the Gare St. Lazare. "Needless to say, from this point on, it is imperative... "that you make no mistakes. "Once in the subway, stand by the door when you reach St. Lazare station. "Do not give any indication that you're getting off but wait. "As the train is about to start again, and the doors begin to close, "quickly step onto the platform at the last possible instant. "This procedure will enable you to lose any possible police surveillance... "in case you haven't been able to earlier. "Remember that we will be watching to see if you follow instructions. "At the baggage counter, you will exchange the stub for an empty suitcase, "which you will take to the Champs Elysees, "where you will find two banks facing each other. "You will go into each bank and ask for the manager, to whom you will identify yourself. "Lfhe doesn't know you by name, he will at least have heard of this affair. "Tell him that you are being watched, "that what you have to do must be done immediately, "out in the open, at the teller's window, "and that any attempt on his part not to cooperate... "or to contact the police will endanger the life of your daughter. "Then give him half the money you're carrying, "money you have undoubtedly listed, "and ask him to change it into small, used bills of 50 and 100 francs. "If the first bank is cooperative, the second will be even more, "since you will probably have help from across the street. "Please remember that you will be watched at all times, "that any attempt on your or anyone's part... "to mark or register the number of these bills... "would be fatal to your daughter. "So be careful and watch the others around you... "as if you were one of us. The care with which you handle this matter... "will be reflected by the care your daughter receives. "And understand that her fate is in your hands. "When you have changed the money, take a taxi to the airport, "where you will be paged under the name of G.H. Dupont... "by a pilot of a private chartered plane, Mr. Charles Lambert. "Since he will not know that you are not Mr. Dupont, "be very careful not to discuss anything that may ultimately endanger your daughter. "With the hope that you've understood everything, we sincerely wish you good luck. '" Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. Tell him yourself. Wait a minute. Present from your sister. Taste it. Yeah? I can't hear you. I've got a... I've got a cab waiting. Wait a minute. Listen, talk louder. I can't hear you. Yeah. The father is taking off right now. Just think, Wally, tomorrow at this time, we're going to have exactly what we want. Everything we want. Everything? Monsieur, Madame? Deux Scotch, s'il vous plait. Deux cafes. Oui, Monsieur. Eh, cafe pour le monsieur. Scotch pour moi, s'il vous plait. Oui, Madame. Okay, go ahead. Uh, hello? Um, pouvez-vous me dire si Monsieur Lambert est arrive? II est arrive? Oh, no, no. Je voudrais parler avec son passager, un Monsieur Dupont. Dupont. Monsieur Dupont est demande au Bureau de I'Information. Monsieur Dupont est demande au Bureau de I'Information. Mr. Dupont? Mr. Dupont, this is a friend of your daughter's. No, no! She's fine. Uh, she's just... Well, that's what I'm calling about. Uh, now, now, just take a taxi... and tell him to take you to the Cafe de la Place. Did you get that? The Cafe de la Place. Right. Just wait there. Mr. Dupont, she's fine. Now please just listen to me and do as I say and everything will work out fine. Just go to the Cafe de la Place and wait there. #One early morning # # Early morning # #Love left # #Without a warning # #And you went away from me ## Qu'est-ce que vous voulez, monsieur? Allo? Allo? Allo? Allo? He's ready. You better be going. Yeah. What's the matter? I'm... I'm scared. For God's sake, we're counting on you. Why do we have to go through all of this? Why can't we just get the money, he gets his daughter, we get out of it? You've been enough trouble already. Now just do your job. Okay. - Okay. - I'm sorry. ...en ce qui concerne le kidnapping... la famille a demande aux autorites de leur donner une liberte... complete afin de faciliter les contacts avec les ravisseurs. Nos prochaines informations dans une heure. D'ici la, nous continuons avec Route De Nuit. Well, what did he say? Uh, qu'est qu'il a dit? La family de la girl kidnapper ask les autorites... for complete liberte to contact les kidnappers. Merci. Ces salauds.! Those... Those... How you say, bastardos.! They will amuse themselves with that girl, huh? Croyez-moi. Did you see her photo in the newspapers? Hmm? No. Kid? No, please! Please, let me go! My father will give you anything! Please! Now, listen. I just came to tell you that everything's gonna be all right. Listen, nothing's gonna happen. Sit here, read your magazine and I'll be back in a little while. You're not going to leave me alone... no, not with him? I'll do anything. You don't have to do that, kid. You just hang out. Hello there, Clark Gable. Someday somebody's gonna invent a comfortable gun. I suppose it would be prudent, before you charge off to your adventures, if you and I had some kind of an understanding. You've got one hour. If you are not back here in one hour, I pick up the phone, I call the police, and they get the names and numbers of all the players. And after I have identified you, I will then give the police the complete escape route, including the time and location of the airplane. And without the airplane, you know where you are. Where does that leave you? Well, you got enough to do tonight. I don't want you to worry about that. - What else? - Oh. When the car comes for you, I want you to take the two goody-bags and put them in the back of the car. And I want you to get in the front. And then, I want you to drive away immediately. I don't have a machine gun here. All I've got is that little girl, And oh, Lockinfar, if you are not back here within an hour, I will become very nervous. And I'll have a very strong need... for relaxation, amusement. And if I go to work on her, you won't want to see the result. I just want to sit up. Now let's see where we are. I got an hour. Let's say I get a flat tire. This is not a discussion. You've got one hour. There's my wheels. Uh, I'll tell you rather quickly. Uh, I don't want you to hurt the kid. I don't want you to touch her. And if I come back and I find that she's not all right, I'm gonna take that burp gun and I'm gonna jam it up your nose. And I'm gonna pull the trigger 'til it doesn't work anymore. You just come back one hour from now, and we'll take it from there. Have a nice trip. I'll see you to the door. What's the matter? Move over. Come on. You look as if you're upset. No, it's all right, baby. Merci. Bonsoir. A demain. A demain. Si vous voulez encore un verre, vous feriez mieux de me le dire maintenant. Je ferme. Pardon. Je ne comprends pas tres bien. If you want another drink, tell me before I go bed. Yeah. Yeah, I'll have another. Monsieur, et vous? Monsieur? Yes, what? Another tea? - Oui, Oui. - Closing early tonight, no? Et qu'est-ce que vous voulez? Finished for tonight. Bonsoir. Bonsoir. Donnez-moi un paquet americain. Ah, Docteur.! Good evening. - Good evening. - How is our patient? Oh, la vache.! Qu'est-ce que c'est? Je ferme. Allez. Finish your drink. I close up. Bye. We don't have time, babe. Oh, pardon. Ca va, ca va. Eh, je ferme. Je ferme la.! Eh, je ferme.! C'est pas un pissoir ici. Ils sont chez eux, hein? - Hello. - What is the trouble now? - No trouble. - What are you doing here then? What's the matter? Oh, I... I just had a fight with my husband. Is hejealous? - What? - Jealous of your friend? The one I just saw you with ten minutes ago in this car. Hey. Reste en place, ne bouge pas. Toi aussi. Okay, Pop. Open it up. Open it up. Hurry up. Close it. Give it to me over your right shoulder. Move.! Come on! I'm comin'! What happened? Thank you, my dear, for a charming interlude. What are you doing? Now listen, I want you to go to the house. Get there in three minutes and not before. Here. Let me help you with that. Hey, Lockinfar, what are you gonna do now? Hmm? I'm gonna give you a chance to think about it. Would you fasten, fasten, fasten... Would you fasten, fasten, fasten... Would you fasten your seat belt, please? Would you fasten your seat belt, please? We're about to land. Okay. Thank you very much. Hope to see you again soon. Thank you very much. Hope to see you again soon. Thank you very much. Hope to see you again soon. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoy your stay in Paris.
