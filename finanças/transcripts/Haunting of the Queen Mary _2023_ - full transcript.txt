Everything will be fine. Just continue upstairs, please. Keep moving, please. Sir, keep moving, please. There you go, Sir. Are there at least enough lifeboats this time? Keep calm, go upstairs please. Hello? Mrs Ratch? The porter found her twenty minutes ago. And? Apparently, her husband used an axe. Oh my God. The lunatic hasn't stopped whistling since he got here.

It's like trying to catch a fish with bare hands. The trick is to wait and let it come to you, then when it gets close... grab it!

Go do some of that ghost hunting, honey. For thirty-one years, the Queen Mary served as a majestic city of the sea. Now she's dropped anchor for the final time. Closing out a career unequalled in the history of commercial sea voyaging. A career that took her through a depression, a world war, a period of unequalled glory, and a last great voyage. Well, I would describe this Queen Mary's the most elegant and the finest ship that has ever sailed any of the oceans. The saddest thing is, I think, to ever happen because this has got to be one of the most beautiful ships that was, er... anyone's ever built. We feel that The Queen Mary will be sort of the crown jewel in what we hope will be the foremost water recreation development in the entire United States. Their predictions are as high as two and a half million people a year will be coming down to visit and board The Queen Mary for its various activities.

I'm, I'm good. - Er, well, although, er... the publisher thinks a more holistic approach is needed. Um, books, website, 3D tour? Guests have reported seeing a woman in white, playing piano. A war bride, who, after learning her husband died serving in France, took her own life. You can pick up a limited-edition doll of the woman in white in the gift shop on your way out. Next, we'll see where Fred Astaire once danced the cha cha. I'm half expecting Fred Astaire to jump out and try sell me a hoover. - So, what's this about a 3D tour? - Oh, sorry. Er, you know, I just thought you could mention it to him. It, it's a big thing to just mention. There are no visuals, no concept work. Besides we've been through this... - Hey, uh... - the ship's almost 80 years old. - Hey, Dad. It deserves something... - I'm thirsty. You can feel and touch. Something that lasts. - Can I get a frappe? - Er, sure. No, honey. Who lets a kid drink coffee? - Oh, come on! - Fine. Hang on, I'll give you water. Oh, forget it. With or without all this. But, er, you don't agree? No, I do, I do. I think you're incredibly noble. - Well, thank you. - And righteous. - Yeah, keep going. - And have amazing intentions.

I like it. - Yes, Sir, about that... -Passengers travel on The Queen Mary because of two words, Blue Riband. Not just an award for fastest transatlantic crossing, but a guarantee. - Evening, gentlemen. - Captain. So, if our rivals want the title of world's fastest, well, fuel consumption is the new battle ground. Not propulsion. Slow? Gibson, why haven't you rung off full ahead? Yes, Sir, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Standing still would mean almost certain death for a project of this magnitude. So, when the Great Depression halted construction for over a year, a deal was struck for Cunard to merge with White Star Line. Owners of the ill-fated Titanic. Creating Cunard White Star. Steam was generated in massive furnaces, superheated and passed to engine at seven-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. About four-hundred pound per square inch. Phew! Now, I don't mean to scare y'all, but this was the scene of an accident in 1938, when steam built up behind an emergency door, escaped, killing an engineer... shutting down the main engine. Guests have since reported hearing his haunting scream... -Dad! Throughout the ship. Hey, Dad! Dad! Dad! She survived head on collisions, Hitler's relentless wolf packs and even a one-hundred-foot rogue wave, causing many to believe her blessed. Mrs Calder? Mrs Calder. - Miss. - Oh, Miss Calder. Yes, yes. Hello, hello. Um, Mr Torres? Er, no, er, Charles Bittner. Are you the historian? I'm our, er, humble Captain. I work directly with Mr Torres, our historian. You were delayed? He asked if I'd fill in. Oh, please. Shit. Hello? Pipes started shaking, so I reduced the speed. - And? - Problem's coming from in there. It's hot to the touch. I wouldn't venture in there. My guess is cracked steam pipes and a cocktail of superheated oil. That room is probably 700 degrees. We need to shut her down, Captain. Let the engineers do their work. No. Reduce speed to 15 knots. - Captain, it only takes a spark from... - All that clatter down here, you must've lost your hearing. I said do not stop. By all means, find a way to reduce the pressure and speed. Gradually. But do not stop. And the next time you decide to slow my ship without my consent, I'll leave you at the nearest port. Yes, Captain. H-hello? Are you lost? How old are you? Eight. Me too. Hello? Down here. I didn't know there still was a ship's Captain. There is not. But don't tell anyone. I just like the suit. So, why a book about us, exactly? I am a digital marketing consultant... and my... my son is obsessed with ghost stories. A little too obsessed actually and... Bittner, are you there? Well, er, one day he has this dream and he says to me, "Mom, I had a dream that I was on The Queen Mary." And I was like, "Oh, you know, we should go visit." And he said, "No, I had a dream we lived there." Not kidding. And so, you know, it got me thinking, um, what about doing a book from a child's perspective? - Hmm. - Exploring the ship and some of the... stranger stories. - Ghost stories? - Yes, the ghost stories. And also explore the ship's rich history and we could raise awareness and we could help save it. I didn't know we needed saving. Just what I see in the media. Stories. Right. Stories. You know, we're pretty used to stories around here, I mean, people have said we're a doorway for the dead. And although we're famous for our fiction, you know, sometimes facts can be much stranger. Did you know in 1942, while, er, transporting German and Italian prisoners, she collided with one of our own escort ships? Sank it. Killing all but 99 of its 400 sailors. And she just continued on with little more than a scratch. Would you take me on a tour? Beautiful. Oh, yes, we have exactly five hundred and ninety-six working clocks aboard The Queen Mary. Wow. Really is a time machine in here. We should definitely get all these details in the book. Well, the Queen's Salon was a social hub at night. Winston Churchill used to sit over there, Alfred Hitchcock drank his martini there, and Bob Hope wrote his column over there. Tourists, they love that. You know, knowing what famous people did, where they went. Is there anything else you can show me? People came here to enjoy glamour. They still do. We host brunch on Sundays. Wedding receptions. Corporate parties. You know, Bar-mitzvahs and what-not. Oh, throughout the voyage, er, those ships marked The Queen's Mary's location along the Atlantic. Unfortunately, they stopped working after we permanently docked in '67. We could capture these fascinating details in a wholly original way. Well, other people have taken pictures. How do you propose your book will be any different? The quality of the work and the story you tell with the pictures, that's all very important. But... have you ever thought about virtual reality? Imagine taking a tour of The Queen Mary. Not as it is now, but... as it was in, I don't know, 1938 or even 1944. What would that entail? On site time. Just the scanning. The coding we could do from anywhere. But we would need to cover... every inch of the ship. You're fucking kidding me? I'm sorry? Thank you, Miss Calder. I'll, er, pass this along to Mr Torres and we'll get back to you. Over here is the grand salon and, er, if you'll all come this way, we'll go to our... He seems traumatised. I just... sorry, I turned around, he was just gone and I... How'd the meeting go? Fine. Um, I was thinking, if this book thing goes well, maybe we could try again. Settle down, buy a house. I'm the only one still renting at my firm, so... Does now feel like the right time to be talking about this? All I wanna do is know that we're thinking the same thing for our son. 'Cause Lukas needs stability, we, we both need stability, right? There is no 'we'. - And he's not your son. - Come on. We, we, we raised him together. You can't just move to another town and shut me out. Stop it, it's way overdue we all moved on. I, I hear what you're saying, but it's a house, not a prison. You always made it feel so God damn permanent. Jackie, darling. If I'm doing that I, I'm not aware... You mustn't worry. - Move to another town and... - We have to move forward. You're going to a new home. This is your home. You die here, you stay here forever. Honey, are you okay? Wait for us there. And we'll be a family again. We found him. No big deal. - He's wet. - Yeah, I can see that. You know, but otherwise unharmed. Come on, let's get you home and dry. You poor thing. Miss Calder! Wait, wait! Miss Calder! Miss Calder? Charles Bittner. Good news. We'd like you and your family to come back and work on that exciting project. Mr Torres thinks is a great idea. Luckily, we've renovation scheduled this weekend, so, you'll have the, er, the entire ship to yourself. ♪ Good times are finally back ♪ ♪ Here to stay and that's a fact ♪ ♪ Living free again... ♪ ♪ Good times are finally back ♪ I'm on the lookout for my next big star. She could be right here, in this room, you just never know. You just never know. Where are you going? How's he supposed to notice me if I'm planted to a chair? I told you, we don't beg, ever. Well, I say let the cards decide. No, we shouldn't draw attention. What if somebody else questions and we've to explains things? - Things? - Things. We were offered tickets to America and we took 'em. What's wrong with that? They paid me to read their fortune. I told them they'd die if they left London. Who's to say they wouldn't? That was wrong. It's not what the cards said. We were fine in third class. We don't belong there and neither does she. Hmm-mm. Now then, put that in your pipe. Have you seen George's new film? Oh, it's simply divine. Hepburn lights up every room. Including the box office. I don't know how to compare it to some of his earlier pictures, probably not as entertaining as Two Dinosaurs Meet While Ice Skating. But it is just magical, wouldn't you agree? Excuse me, Sir. Now, you may ask, what is the distinction between subject matter and style. - But this is a cinematic... - I'm a dancer. - experiment in style. - I'd to audition for your next movie. What now, my dear? I'm a dancer. I'd like to audition for your next movie. I'm the star you've been looking for. Did your parents not teach you that it is very rude to come to a table uninvited? - Oh, Viktor. Come now. Good evening, your name please. Mr and Mrs Howe. Frightfully sorry I had to cancel earlier. My wife is feeling much better now. Is there a table still free? What happened? Oh. David. He once asked, can I give him a scoop? A scoop, I said, of what ice cream?! Well, I'm a sherbet... Excuse me. Sir, that's my girl you just spoke to. She's, er, just a little upset. Now... I apologise that she interrupted you, but she wants to be in movies more than anything and, er... and now she's just a little upset. She's talking about abandoning her dream, which upset my wife. Oh, we're also performers. Now, she's a dancer. A very good one. Better than that Ginger Rogers. - Oh, she is? - Oh! You'll be doing me a big favour if you just reconsider. You, you see what see can do, you won't be sorry. Please. Please. And who are you? My thought exactly. Go home. We'll reschedule. Why would you invite us here and then tell us to go home? Isn't the book from your son's perspective? Er, yeah, but... Well, so he should be here. It's empty now. It's the perfect time to do it. Oh, we refurbish all the time. Yeah, tourism is eating this ship alive. People come, they take things. Souvenirs that cost us a fortune. You know the worst offender? I mean, you'll laugh. Mould. - What, mould? - Hmm. Such a tiny nuisance, you know. We got leaking roofs, dripping air ducts, sweating plumbing pipes and all this... damp. I mean, you wouldn't think it when you're up there in the fresh air. But below deck is the perfect breeding ground for some really... nasty organisms. Which might explain why your son is sick. Tell me, did Lukas mention the ship when you got home? He said he left his camera in the pool area. - Pool? - His clothes were wet. No, pockets of stagnant water. Poor ventilation. He said the pool. When we docked in '67, the boilers came out, so did the pool above it. It was a tragedy, really. She was a real pearl. But... Look, er, I know this isn't the same without Lukas. So how about when you come back, I'll give you a deluxe, all access, tour. With me as your guide, yeah? And, er, this is you. I had to leave my very sick son... at home in order to come here because he knows this is, um... a last chance for us. I even had to call my very unpleasant mother to ask her to watch him. And as you can imagine, I don't like calling her for anything. We are just not leaving here empty handed... Captain. I am not asking you, I am begging you. Okay. Okay! But, er, anything below M deck is restricted. He's not exactly Captain material, is he? If you don't wanna do this, I understand. I'm here, aren't I? Your mask, Sir. Remove it. My mask? What does that have to do with anything? There is a special place in hell for men who impersonate war heroes. If you're not who you claim to be, then who are you?

Just, just... just tell them it's part of tonight's entertainment. Sir? - Why aren't you upstairs? - Well, I was. But an incident occurred with one of the passengers. - Well, take care of it. - There's been a murder. David Ratch. Travelling third class with his family. Appears Mr Ratch lost his senses some time after dinner. Found him covered in his wife's blood trying to launch a life vessel. Took three men to restrain him. He's in the infirmary now. Bloody hell, how did they get down here? Captain! Why's she so slow this evening, huh?! Party's upstairs, gentlemen. - Are we sinking?! - Alright, alright. That'll do. The fastest ship, my arse. Where is Mrs Ratch? Cabin B-474. Apparently, he did it with an axe. Made a frightful mess. They have a young daughter. Our people are trying to locate her. She was last seen leaving the grand salon by herself, approximately eight thirty. How dare you make a joke about my wife?! I wasn't... Sir, respectfully, why are we here and not at the scene or on the bridge? I needed to see for myself. Clock stopped at seven. Same time you reported the accident downstairs. The prisoner say anything? Well, like what? Other than the obvious crazy? Was there anything that stood out? Well apparently, his friends call him Clarky. Thought it was a bit odd for someone with the surname Ratch. He then used some rather choice words to indicate how the officer could use a 'so-and-so' and insert it. - A cigarette? - No. - Have you a cigarette, Gibson? - Oh. It must be time to send an SOS. Have you witnessed a ship go down? No. I have. My father did everything he could. Gave the order within plenty of time. People get scared. They panic... and fight like rats. I won't let that happen on this ship. Not while we can still save her. Well, shall I report to the bridge and... coordinate our resources from there? You don't understand. Our only concern now is Mr Ratch. Frightfully sorry to bother you. But I'm supposed to meet my husband in New York. And the captain said I can't disembark. If you see my husband, can you send him a message? I need... Oh! To leave... this... ship... I need to leave this ship, I need to leave this ship! I need to leave this ship! I need to leave this ship! I need to leave this ship! I need to leave this ship! I need to leave this...! The pool. It's below M deck. Bittner, you sneaky little prick. Shit. It's all wet. Even the scanner. This'll need time to dry. Friend of Bittner's, you think? You know, I thought if we did this project together, you and Lukas would come home and we'd be... a... a kind of family again. But honestly, the last thing I expected was to get your answer before we even started. So, I, I guess... how come I wasn't enough? Oh no. No, no, that's not what it is. I just don't believe in marriage. I failed once. I still want to escape. It's just that the urge to be with Lukas is stronger. You know, if you stay here, you'll get trapped like that shrieking woman. You'll end up as a footnote in one of Bittner's haunted tours. A historical curiosity, nothing more. Patrick. Yeah? I can't leave my son alone here. Fine. We can be the dead family still walking the deck. Ugh, that smell. Motherfuckers! Look. He's still here, Patrick. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, Christ. Send the distress code. It won't make a difference, don't you see? The man roaming freely is why the ship is faltering. Hello? Miss Calder? Are you alright in there? Oh, fuck! Wow, he used the whole roll. Be careful. I need to know what Bittner's hiding. Is that it? Damn. I've never seen a doorway to... fuck knows. Anything? Is that a... child? No. No, judging by the size, I'd say an adult. And it's in the structure, so probably from the time the ship was built. Also, there's no way they could put the metal poles in there after pouring the concrete. Which... which tells me the workers knew about it. Or they did it. After Wall Street tumbled in '29, Clydebank shipyard closed its doors. While this vessel was just bare bones. The ship spent three long years overlooking that town. Like a coffin. As if they needed reminding what would happen if her future couldn't be secured. Then with the nation's pride at stake, the British Government stepped in with a financial commitment, to guarantee completion. With Clydebank's future at stake, the workers stepped in. To guarantee her success. And that of future generations. Crime locks many doors. But for one prisoner, it required... sacrifice. Foundation sacrifice, to be exact. According to an old engineering tradition, to guarantee structural integrity, one ought to bury a human inside of the walls. And the more pain he suffers, the greater the bind... between his spirit... and the ship. Until both are inseparable. The workers selected their victim, Edward Clark. Or Clarky as he was known to them. A riveter and former inmate, rumoured to have murdered. They inflicted on him the most miserable of ends. His sacrifice protected them. Gave them the success and peace of mind they so badly craved. That's a real thing? What, foundation sacrifice? Yeah. Well, it's not exactly on the curriculum at university, but yeah, sure. From time-to-time cases have occurred. I mean, it's an open secret. Even kids' rhymes are about it. London Bridge keeps falling down until... Until they lock a man inside. Yeah. Folklore based on a grain of truth. My God, that is barbaric. And you actually believe we're unsinkable?! Might explain how the ship survived a World War a dozen botched face lifts, a rogue wave. RTo reinstate the ship's power, we must reinstate Mr Clark, and kill whatever flesh he is in. Should we fail... your question as to whether this ship is unsinkable... will most certainly be answered. Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God. Shit! Lukas?! Patrick! I see him. - Baby, come back! - Wait! Anne! Anne? Are you there? Patrick, come in! Patrick. Yeah, I'm here. I followed Lukas to an elevator, but he's gone. Where are you? I don't know, er, cabin numbers are E-100s. Okay, stay where you are... Clear the way, coming through! Keep moving, upstairs. And follow the safety orders. Where is it? Come on! Keep moving! Out of the way! Coming through! You're not from here, are you? I'm sorry, excuse my impertinence. - Mum? - Stay with us, please. Lukas? If you wish to stay, y- y-you could take my place! I really don't mind! It's wonderful, wonderful fun! And I could leave... just for a little while. You don't understand! I've been here for so long! I promise, I'll come back. None of this is real. - None of this is real. - Need your body! But I need you more! Why should you go and not me?! Fuck me. People are waiting for me! Please! I'm begging you! Lukas! Where are you?! Give me your body! I must get off of this boat! Stop! Where are you? I thought you'd gone home. Er... yeah, we got lost on the way out. Have you seen Anne anywhere? No. Who's that? That's nobody. You sure? Yeah. So, so that... that's not her on the trolley? Oh, him? No, it's just, er... just some vagrant I caught, er, sneaking around. Okay. Okay. Er, we, we found the swimming pool, by the way. You're right, she's, she's a, she's a pearl. And the, er, little brat who absconded in your son's place? She told us everything. Now, I was hoping you'd, er, return with her, so I could give you back your son. We left instructions. If we don't walk out of here tomorrow, call the cops. Tell them everything. Okay? So even if that was true, who'd believe her stories? Well, actually, a lot of people would. Whatever secrets you've kept hidden down here, Lukas saw. Okay, he saw them. Give that to me. No. No, no, no. Not until we're safely off the ship. Move, move, move! Where's that boy? Clarky! As we approach the next stop of our tour, we are reminded in these hallowed halls of how insignificant we really are. When even a ship as hardy as the Queen Mary could be brought to her knees. The year 1942, she was en route to Scotland with ten thousand, three hundred and ninety-eight soldiers, and nine hundred and fifty crew on board. Duly recorded on the ship's log is the date and time, the course, the destination, weather conditions, temperature, longitude and latitude. But what is never recorded is the fear that washes over a deck like fog and ocean spray, as a ninety foot rogue wave appears. Yes, the RMS Queen Mary is a frightened ship, and she carries with her a premonition... of death. Lukas. Oh, Lukas, baby. Is that you? Is that you? What happened to Jackie, Mommy? Where are you? Anne, please come in. Fuck. Oh. Lukas? Where are you? Keep moving and stay calm. It's all part of the show! Move! Move, move, move! Don't let him off the ship! Reverse the winch. No, lower it! Lower it! Mom, why can't I move on? Oh, Lukas baby. Jackie told me what happened. We left him in the pool. - To rot... - with the others. Dad used to say... opportunity is slippery Like... Like trying to catch a fish... with your bare hands. No matter how much it begs, tries to slip away, hold on tight. And don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Where... is... she? She's waiting for her mom. Stay with me... forever. We'll be a family again. Yes, I'll stay. It's useless trying to leave, Clarky. Even if I have to swim, I'm getting off this ship. Outside, there are laws and obstacles to freedom. Inside, there's only her. I served my time. I served my time! I served my time! You're the guardian, Clarky. It's what they call 'a job for life'! - Gibson! - Captain, the man is unarmed! Let go, you fool. Or he'll take us all to a watery grave. Captain! Lower your rifle, or I will have you forcibly removed and relieved of your duties. If you are unwilling to perform your duty, I won't hesitate. Get back in your box! Play something.

Perhaps you can tell us. Yeah? Your secret? I'm afraid I, er, I don't know what... I, I don't know what you mean, I... As the ship's longest serving employee, how she survived for so long? Well, er, young lady, I can, er, I can recommend just the book. Available from our gift shop! Okay, who wants a picture? Come on, bring it in. There you go. This your first time with a captain? Ah. Where is she? She? He. My son. We would like to speak with you about the statement you provided detectives three days ago. After Lukas climbed out his bedroom window, you said he accidentally slipped. And fell. Well, a neighbour has come forward with an account which... contradicts yours. Help me! Please! I'm sorry about your boy. I had to escape. No. No, no. No... er... We, er... we escaped. Miss Calder. Sir, we, we escaped. Miss Calder, you're being charged with second degree murder. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney... Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Miss Calder? Miss Calder? Captain Bittner for Torres. Please hold. Mr Torres on line two. Bittner? You there? In the flesh. They lived their hopes and dreams buried in her lavish woods and polished decks. Now, resting and all but forgotten, they wait to return to life. In a few moments, the new Ghosts and Legends tour, No Escape, will disembark from the grand staircase on the promenade level. Join our resident guides as they lead you into the depths of the RMS Queen Mary in an effort to connect with spirits who still call this ship home. That's Ghosts and Legends, No Escape, departing soon.
