BASED ON MANY TRUE EVENTS Out here in the country, we are patient. We don't talk much, because nothing much happens. But when something does happen, everybody talks about it. And everybody knows about it. And they'll never forget it until you're dead and buried. A lot of people can't handle that, so they stop caring. And not even death scares them. In fact, they crave it. Nobody can escape it. My daughter spent five years trying to make it in the city. Now here she is. Nowhere to live. No money. Just one small suitcase. Can I help you? I only sleep with guys like you if the police are after me. Five vodkas, please. Okay. Loser pays all. You in? Yeah. Take your coat off. Okay. -You live in there? -Not all the time, obviously. Does it lock from the inside? Yeah. What's your name? Names build trust. Sam. Edda. Come in. Now you're in for it. Morning. Are you a poet? What? You have so many books. Do you just read, or do you write too? I just read. But they're all in English. Why do you read in English? It's my job. Reading books in English is your job? American literature. And that's a job? I'm a professor at Frankfurt University. Well, assistant professor. So why are you here? For a conference. -And you're staying in this camper? -Yeah. You mind sharing that comforter? How about a trip to the countryside? -I have to go to the conference. -But it's the weekend. You can skip a little conference. -It's as green as it'll ever be. -Sorry. No problem. You could've honked. Honking is harassment. I don't harass people. So just drive around us. Settle down. I don't know where you're from, but we stick to the rules here. And green means go. Yeah. We'll get going in a moment. Now it's red again. See? You think that's funny? You know what I think is funny? Do you? Stop that! -You think that's funny? -No! So laugh! Come on, laugh! You can do better than that. -Yes! -Stop it! Now that's funny. Have a good weekend. -Let's go to the police. I'll report him. -No, they might blame us. You can't let him get away with that. Can you stop here? It might have been a bad idea to come here. I don't know if I can stand it. Do you smoke? No. Hey! Let me go! -Did you hear that? -Yes. You bastards! Keep going. Have you all gone crazy? -It sounds serious. I'm going to check. -Forget it. I know the guys around here. Let them sort out their shit. It's what they do on the weekends. -Help! -Come on. Let go of me! Help! -Somebody needs help. -Sam, just leave them alone. Don't worry about it. I'll be right back, okay? Hey! Now stay down. Hey. Rudi, you should have known this wouldn't end well for you. You're in for a good beating. I wouldn't want to be you. Rudi. -Never touch what isn't yours. -Are you serious? What do you think? Of course I'm serious. Actions have consequences. Don't do that. And who are you? You can still walk away from this. Are you telling me what to do? No. Stop! Listen, you're making a big mistake. It'll come out sooner or later. Rudi! Ronny, get him! Grab the smartass! Edda! Edda! Edda! Hey! Get out of the way! Thoralf, go after them! It's a dead end. They can't go far. I'm on it. Chop, chop! What the fuck is going on? Left! Turn left! Shit! Shit! -Shit. -Hey, what are you doing? -My phone! -Forget your phone. Come on! Fuck! You're a joke. Get in. You too. Come on! Hey, stop! What? -I have stitches. -They're still after us. Come on, they're tired. -Pigsty? -Pigsty. -Steffen, go 'round the back. -Why don't I get the gun? -You wouldn't shoot. -Says you! You've got a knife. Steffen, hey. Stop this shit. You don't have to go along with it. It'll all be okay, Steffen. -Steffen… -I found them! Shut up, Steffen! -Shut up. -Stop it! Put that away or you'll get hurt. Steffen, stop this shit! Just stop it! God! Shit, I didn't mean to do that. Why are you running around with a knife, you idiot! What's wrong? Shit. Why did you have to use the knife? Don't. I'm bleeding like crazy. Look. Herrmann has a kit. I know first aid. First aid? I need to go to the hospital. Chill out. It's not that deep. How do you know? Who got stabbed? -Fortunately, it was you. -Oh, shit. -We'll pull it out slowly. -No, don't touch me! I'll hit you! -Don't! -It'll get infected, Steffen! I'm dying. -I can tell. -You're not dying. -Yes, I am. -Can you be quiet? -Who are you calling? -Herrmann. I'm dying. I can feel it. I'm dying. You killed him. He's not dead. And he was trying to kill me. -You killed him. -He's not dead. Stop walking. -Can you explain what's going on? -No. -Where are we going? -I don't care where you're going. Oh, yeah? It's your bloody fault I lost Edda. Who's Edda? What are you talking about? -She came here with me. She's gone. -How's that my problem? And they're chasing us, not her. What do you want from me? What's wrong now? Just come with me. I'm going to the next village. You can catch a bus home or wait for your girlfriend. I don't give a shit. Just don't get on my nerves. Excuse me? Excuse me. I'm off duty. My boyfriend has been kidnapped. He's in danger. Okay, calm down. Start over. What happened? Wait, you're what's-her-name. You're Edda? Oh, wow. I haven't seen you in ages. I was just going to see your father! That basket is for him. -Were you going there? -Yes. But that's not the point. -My boyfriend's in danger. -You don't recognize me? No. Are you not listening? I'm Frank. Frankie Boy. No? Well, I was a bit ahead of you in school. From La Cu? La Cucaracha? Remember the big parties? Come on. Edda. That's cool. Yeah. I'm Edda. And I need your help, Frank. What kind of village is this? This isn't a village. Are you starting again? I need to get something. Stay here and keep watch. -What? No. -Or just go if you want. Where? So, what do you do? Study? -I'm getting a PhD. -I wanted to get one too. Doctor of Policing. But if everybody did that, who would do the actual work? Too many leaders, not enough workers. Never ends well. And your boyfriend? Is he getting a PhD too, or does he have one already? He's got one. Could we drive a bit faster? Please don't use that tone, okay? You know why I resent women like you? You left, and now that you're back, nothing's good enough. Who's been holding down the fort? There are four men to every woman. You think that's fair? -What are you talking about? -God, those are just some facts. You know how old my girlfriend is? Manuela is 48. And I'm 35. We've been together for two years, but it's too late. We wanted to have kids, but adopting is impossible. We could have adopted an 8-year-old, but who wants to adopt a kid that age? Manu doesn't want to, and I get it. They make everything so difficult. How will we ever get more young people? Did you consider that when you left? How this place is dying? No, right? Yeah, no. And you didn't even recognize me. That's harsh. Can we look for my boyfriend? See? That's exactly what I mean. That attitude. Fuck. It doesn't work. Put your hands up. I just want to make a call. Who are you trying to call? The police. Fucking police. Come with me. Where? To your friend. Move it. Can't you do anything without me? I left you alone for five minutes. Pull it out. -No. -Wolf will do it. Steffen, what goes in must come out. We'll put a bandage on. It'll be fine. I'm cold. I'm so cold. Breathe! I can explain. We're being followed. It used to be really busy here. Everyone used to work here, and we were proud of it. -We had our own kindergarten. -We are being followed. More than 300 people had good jobs here. We had parties, ate together, and… Put your hands down. We had our own combat group, our own soccer club, our own holiday camp. And here's our pride and joy, our sauna. It still works. Let me out, asshole! Open the fucking door! Let me out! Hey! Better settle down. It's not good for the heart. A sauna is for sitting and sweating. It's good for you. Cleans out the pores. -Eliminates all the toxins. -Open the door! We used to love sitting here after work. It was very sociable. But young people don't appreciate being sociable. It's every man for himself. Hey! Do something! Open the door. Let me out. -Let him go. -Do something! -He hasn't done anything to you. -Open the door! Don't act all innocent. He was trying to steal my glorious AK-47. Actions have consequences. If you mess with my stuff, you'll go to the sweatbox. Hey! Don't you dare break my sauna! -Just let him out. -He needs to be punished. He's about to faint. No, that would take longer. But if you want to help your friend, you can take his place. Rudi! We just want to talk. What's this? Better get your friend out before his goose is cooked. Hey. Come on. How dumb do you have to be to drive into this? Yeah, but I heard a shot. There are hunters around here. They hunt wild boars. -And the bullet hole? -Bullet hole? Maybe, maybe not. Well… That's good. The professor is a hippie. Wow. Man! This is a great bookmobile. Is he a poet? -That's my phone. -Well, now it's evidence. -It's not evidence. It's my phone. -What's this? -The plot thickens. -Why? I think you had a quarrel under the influence of narcotics. And in that state, you drove into this. Your nice Mr. Professor lost it and took off. And now you want me to type up a report on my night off. No way. It's bullshit. Well, let's just forget about the uniform. Have a seat, and let's smoke this. -What? -Come on. We'll destroy the evidence. For you. Come on, okay? So the whole brigade's turned up. So, what's the emergency? Shut it. Where's Rudi? You, get down from there. How should I know who Rudi is? You all look the same to me. And nobody comes here unless they have to. Oh, you. -This is a surprise. -Enough chitchat. -It's a personal matter. -Take off the shades when you talk to me. What happened to your eye? That's why I'm here. Did you see Rudi? Norbert, how does it feel to be Herrmann's little guard dog? It's not personal, Mrs. Völkel. -What do you think of me? -What do you mean? How do I look? Good. What would Herrmann do to you if he knew you touched me? I would never do that, Mrs. Völkel. Good to know. Hey. You touched me. Mrs. Völkel! Mrs. Völkel. You can't control your own people? Can't you pay them anymore? So, is everything okay? Yeah. Boys? Is he paying you? It'll work out if we stick together. Yeah, that's what we used to think. Are you going to hit your father? Herrmann? That's enough. -I told you to wait in the car. -I did too, but… Get a hold of yourself! You're freaking out over nothing. Over nothing? So this is nothing? Yeah, nothing. God, it happens all over the world. Flagranti. I don't give a fuck about what happens in the world. It doesn't happen here! Yes, it does, as you can see. You should ask yourself why it happened. What you did. Or what you didn't do. Because if we're being honest, everyone in this room has fucked me… in their minds. -Stop talking. -This is about you and me. You don't get it. This is about principles. It's bleeding again. Can we please go to the hospital? Great bandage, Thoralf. I'm still bleeding. I'll take you to the doctor. Wolf, take Katja home. I'm not going anywhere. Do as you're told. Don't touch me! Well, she's got you whipped. -If Rudi were here, then-- -Then what? Well, you're in deep shit. I can't wait to see how this turns out. My turn in the sauna. You two can get lost. POLICE Billions of dollars flowing through there, and none of it stays here, not a single cent. Is this supposed to do something? I don't feel anything. Right, let's have a look at what we have here. A naked man. Yeah. So, this is your boyfriend. Another one. A man with a guitar. That's a good one. So you've been fooling around with the boss's wife. Fooling around? I love her. We love each other. I'm going to rescue her, even if… they kill me. -Okay, I get it. -You don't get anything. A man… A man stands up for the woman he loves. What are you doing here? Why aren't you with your girlfriend? You should ask yourself that. -Why? -Yeah, why? Because of you, asshole! I saved your fucking life! "I'll rescue her!" That's bullshit! Can't you just talk? Do you have to kill each other? Black against red! A tooth for a tooth! It's not the fucking Middle Ages! You don't get it! Do I get it now? Yeah, okay. Yeah! The village is over that hill. -Where are you going? -I told you. -He'll rip your head off. -Yeah. I can't help it. He who is in love… cannot lose. You guys are so trapped in your masculinity. There's nothing wrong with my masculinity! You should be thinking about your masculinity! You don't have any! Where are you going? Come back! No. This is pointless. I'm leaving. Are you embarrassed because I'm talking about the past? We can talk about something else. Fine, let's look for your boyfriend. I'll give you your phone. Here. I just want one kiss. Just a teensy-weensy kiss. I want to feel like those guys I've seen on your phone. It's no big deal, Edda. Just a little kiss, then I'll help you. I want to have my piece of the pie. No. I'm not feeling any emotion from you. Give me a real kiss, okay? Just once, like you mean it. Come on. Yeah. That's the old Edda! Now I'm getting some emotion. This is fun. Oh, yeah. Hey! What are you doing? -Give me the gun. -Stay back! You know that's obstruction of justice, right? I don't give a shit. This has got a bit out of hand, don't you think? Give me the gun. We can forget this happened. You know what's wrong with you? You sit on your fat ass, moaning about everything, and you think that's going to change things. Let's stay calm, okay? You're on drugs. Give me the gun. -Come on. -I do remember you now. You've always been an asshole. And I'm going to press charges for rape. Sorry… for… Edda! I'll kill you! Let go! Edda! No, not her. Not the voodoo priestess. I need a hospital. No way! They'd ask too many questions. She'll sew you up. We're closed. Or is it an emergency? Not really, but he needs stitches. If any vital organs were damaged, I'd have to call a helicopter. A helicopter? No way. No vital organs were damaged. Come on, Steffen. -Hi, Ronny. -Hello. See? He just lost a bit of blood. Thoralf will donate. Yeah. I'll donate, sure. -They're friends. -It's about the blood type. Exactly. I'm such an idiot. "Can I help? Sure, I'll come with you." A trip to the country, and surprise. Shit. Fine. I guess I'll go to her parents'. "Well, hello. Yeah, you don't know me." "I'm your daught-- your daughter's boyfriend." "Unfortunately, I lost her on the way here!" I can't look. It makes me queasy. Just close your eyes. Make it snappy. Does she know what to do? I'm from three generations of doctors. And you want something from me! Keep quiet or I'll stop right now. What happened, anyway? -It was… -An accident at work. -Right. -On a Saturday? While drilling. And your eye? -That's been treated. -Lucky for me. Okay, you'll feel a little prick. -You heard what Rainer said. -He's just talking shit. How much longer? I'm not feeling well. Norbert, get a hold of yourself. I'm trying. Herrmann? -Herrmann. -What? What's going on with the wages? It's Christmas, after all. You'll be paid. And Steffen will get his blood. -How much do you need? -About 500 ml. -What? -Oh, God. That's way too much. He's had enough. We're late. -Late? Where are you going? -To the birthday party. To the party? Don't we have more important things to do? I think so. We were invited to the mayor's house. Business never sleeps. Yeah, can you take this out, please? Hey! What are you doing here? How do I find 17 Am Klotzenmoor? You mean Am Moor? What do you want there? Do you have a cigarette? Shut up. I'm talking to him. Come here. -So where is Am Klotzenmoor 17? -Come closer. -What's your name? -Where are you from? -Can you just answer my question? -Nope. You want something from us. -Tell us where you're from. -Berlin. Berlin. Cool. Can I come with you? Where's the house? It's down there. The Köhlers' place. Exactly, the Köhlers. Right. But they're at the inn, celebrating the old man's birthday. And where is the inn? -It's down there too. -Okay, thank you. Who was that guy? -Herrmann! -Hello. Bravo. Bravo. It's so touching. That's why I love you all. And that's why I love this place. And that's why I fight for this place, so it can have a future again. And for that future, we need the logistics center because there will be jobs for you and for your kids so that they'll come back. Sigi, I wish you a happy birthday from the bottom of my heart. -And I wish you all the best. -Thank you. A little gift from the company. No, not in my house. You can put that in your workshop. Yes. Where's Katja? Katja's not well. She's recovering from yesterday. A lovely Christmas party. We really went all out. -It shows. -Here you are. You all look a bit worse for wear. -Antje? -Yes? -To you. -Sigi, to you. And to you, of course, Herrmann. Herrmann, you can always count on me. I want you to know that. -Right. -I know what you've done for us. Come on, have a drink. ARCADE No, Norbi, just put it over there. And? -No. -What do you mean? No means no. They've chosen a different town. It's over. -When did you find out? -Yesterday. That means no for everyone, not just for you. You screwed it up because you don't fight. Call them and make an offer they can't refuse. Fifty percent off, or a third. It's over. -And I won't cheat. -Yes, you will! -Do you know what this means for me? -Yes, I do. Thirty-seven acres of building land could mean 15 million. It's bad for all of us. Here's some friendly advice. If you keep going like this, you'll end up in prison for delaying insolvency. I built something here that none of you could have. I pulled everyone up with me, including you. Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Köhler. -Sigi? -What's going on? Yes. I'm your daughter's boyfriend. We came from Berlin. -Is she here? -She hasn't been here in five years. I didn't know that. She wanted to come to your birthday. But she didn't. That's too bad. I think we should call the police. Why the police? -Young man? -Yes? Why the police? Because… "It's over," my ass. Stay seated. Let's see what the young man's problem is. Come on! Those firemen are always busy. Come on! He can't get away. -What was that all about? -I have no idea. Hey, Berlin! Party time? Yeah! Come on! Get out of the way! Hey, Norbi! Anybody come by here? That way? Thoralf! Ronny! YOU WERE SO YOUNG YOU DIED TOO SOON VOLKER BEHRENS 1990 - 2018 FIRE DEPARTMENT Hey, Volker. It's your anniversary. Who knows, he might be better off up there than we are down here. Death is nothing but the next room. Who knows what he was spared from? Let's go. Come here, you punk! What do you want? I have nothing to do with any of this! That's the problem nowadays. Everyone wants nothing to do with anything. Take off your glasses. Now, get in the car. Thoralf will drive. I can explain. If you go, they'll think it was us. Okay. I have the right to be here. Don't act as if I didn't exist. I've probably spent more time here than you. You're just standing there. What am I, nothing? I see exactly what you are… leering down at me from those lewd pictures. The house is full of them, but they'll be gone soon. I knew it from the start. When Herrmann brought you here, I knew you'd be trouble. You don't fool me. You married Herrmann out of cold calculation. Give me a break, Wolf. Herrmann wanted me. He begged me on his knees. I moved to this godforsaken village for him. It's a miserable dump. Herrmann got what he deserved. Me. You turn everything to shit, our home, our business. Everything we've earned is dangling from your ears. Our friendship. My friend is suffering because of you. I won't take it anymore. Yeah. Pain and suffering. Do you know what I think? The only one who really loves Herrmann… I mean, from the heart… from here… is you. You're jealous. All you want is to swap with me for just one night. One more word and I'll shut you up forever. See? You can tell I'm serious. Wolf… you're gay. It's that simple. And now you're dead. Are you crazy? Rudi. -I did it for you. -What do I tell Herrmann? Yeah, try explaining this. I'll never let you go. If Herrmann sees that… Let's run away together. Shit! Shit. Why isn't he answering? Wolf always answers his phone. Boss! Come here! Do you know what the five pillars of life are? Family… work… money… love… and health. If one pillar fails, it doesn't matter. But if another fails, it all starts to wobble. Don't be afraid. And the last pillar is health. Yeah. Suddenly you can't breathe. What do you do? First, you're afraid. That ends soon. Then comes desire. Every nerve firing at once. One last moment of light before it gets dark forever. What have you done? It wasn't me. -Who was it? -Rudi. Where is he? With Katja. Where are they? What's he doing here? Where are they? They ran off. Hey, can you call a doctor? Herrmann, it… This really hurts. It hurts me too. Inside. That's much worse. I told you. -She's nothing but trouble. -Shut up! She gave me the happiest moments of my life. Herrmann, I… I'm dying here, Herrmann. Yeah. Looks like you lost almost a gallon of blood. You're running low. Wolf. Wolf, do you remember hunting that wild boar we shot? -The two of us? -Yeah, the two of us. -We followed the blood trail. -Yeah. It seemed to go on forever. -We asked ourselves… -Yeah. How long can a pig bleed for? -Then you found it. -Then I found it. -You found it. -I found it. It was lying there, totally still. Totally at peace. Totally at peace. Herrmann, don't give up. Ever. -They can't have gone far. -Yeah. Take my car. I'll take Wolf's. Edda! There you are! You came! You're freezing. Are you okay? Wow, you're so skinny! -Your boyfriend was here. -My boyfriend? Yes. -Where is he? -He left. What do you mean? Listen, we haven't seen you for five years, and all you-- -Not now, Dad. Where is he? -He was here. He asked about you and left. Where did he go? We don't know. Herrmann and his boys went after him. Herrmann. -The Herrmann? -Yes, him. -Thanks for the ride. -Thank you. -Is that Frank's car? -Yes. I have to go. -You want to look for your boyfriend? -Have some faith in her. -How did Edda get Frank's car? -She won't tell us anything. He wouldn't just give her his car. Edda! Frankfurter crown cakes. Very tasty. My pleasure. Illegal. -Get the wheelchair. -Yeah. -Don't you want to walk? -No, I won't do that to myself. -But it would be better, Sigi. -Well, you don't have a new hip. Bernd, I'll do it. Thank you. -Where am I supposed to sit? -Wait a second. Right, let's go. -It was a nice party, wasn't it? -Yes. A great party. I love driving with you. What's up? Take the car. It's a gift. -Just take the autobahn and keep going. -No. -Why not? -I'm not leaving. Not without you. Rudi. Get behind the wheel and drive. -Don't be stupid. -I'm not leaving. I love you. Rudi, I know. And I'm eternally grateful. I've never met a man who stood up for me like you, who thinks of me more than himself. -It's not a bad idea. -Right. -But you have to go. -I've never been anywhere but here. -Where am I supposed to go? -Can you stay with an aunt or an uncle? -Just for a while. -I don't have anyone. -Go to the coast. -What am I supposed to do there? -What'll happen to my mother? -Don't worry. I'll look after her. -Katja, she won't even let you in. -I know. -But I'll figure it out. -Yeah? -How? -If she knows you're okay… -What'll happen to you? -Don't worry about me. I've been through worse. First, I'll deal with Herrmann. What about Wolf? That was you! That's why you have to leave now. I can't. Shit. Fucking shit! Come out! We'll sort this out! -Norbi! -I'm sorry. Out of my Porsche! -Mrs. Völkel! -Take your hands off me! Herrmann! Let Rudi go. -He won't come back. -That's right. He won't. Herrmann, I don't love him. Let him go. We'll go home. -It'll be just like before. -Oh, it's that simple? It'll be like before? You still don't get it, do you? Actions have consequences. Don't do it. Nobody cares what we do here, so we do what we want. I'm not going to do it. You are. Here. It's very simple. You want to live, don't you? So do it. -I won't. -Oh, but you have to. Sweetheart-- Don't touch me! You always say that actions have consequences. This will definitely have consequences. Fuck those consequences! I must always follow through. Frank! Has he lost it? Go! Who do we have here? I wouldn't do that. Hey, smartass! I've got your girlfriend. But she doesn't want to talk. She's very stubborn. Come on. Call him over. Run, Sam! He's bluffing. Don't do it. He'll shoot you. He's got Edda and your girlfriend! Hey, smartass! It could have been so easy for you! Just now, one shot. All done. But no. Here's one last offer. You bring Rudi here, and fast, or your sweet little Edda dies! Come here. -Give me the gun. -Let go. Give me-- Give it to me, man! I'll count to ten. One… two… three… "Following through"? Let go! See, there we go. What am I doing? Where's Rudi? What's going on? If you want Rudi, find him yourself. We're leaving. Come on. You really think you can just walk away like that? Yes. Are you going to shoot me? This should be interesting. You ask other people to do things you can't. You piss and moan about how nobody cares about you. But guys like you aren't worth caring about. You just have a big mouth, that's all. That's enough. I won't dirty my hands with you. Thoralf! Oh, yeah? You're going to do it? Really? For what? For money? He doesn't have any left. You can't tell my men what to do! Yeah, go home to your families. It's almost Christmas! Just leave it. It is what it is. Go home now. We'll talk later. Yeah. Hey, we've known each other for almost 24 hours. I'm sorry. You were right. I should've stayed in the van. No, you were right. You can't let them get away with it. Finish what you start. "Finish what you start." You taught me that. You want to finish it like this? Kill me here? No. But leave me and Katja in peace. I've learned my lesson. Now you'll learn yours. We'll forget this. Fine, Rudi. That sounds reasonable. I'll back off. I've always wanted to go away. South America or… Canada. But, Rudi, every ending is a new beginning. Tell me one thing. Do you even know me anymore? You are a complete idiot. You'll finally answer for what you've done. I'll make sure of it. Once and for all! You won't be telling me what I have to answer for or not. Not you. You are and always will be a loser. -Where did you get the police car? -What? -You came here in it, didn't you? -Yeah. So where are… the police? Edda? Just take me home. Just take me home. Hey, what's wrong? I'm just happy to be here. Sweetheart, it's all right. It's all right. So, what do you say? Are you staying, or do you have to go? Come in. I made some delicious food. Hello. I'm Antje. -Samuel. -Come on in. Katja, are you coming? Thank you, but I have to go. No, you've already missed the party. Come on, have something to eat. Do it for me. Here's to your birthday, Dad. It's so nice that you're all here. So, what happened? We… -We… -Our car got stuck. Where was that? In the forest. Of course. If you drive into the forest, you'll get stuck. We… I took a wrong turn. I read the GPS wrong. Well, you should never follow the GPS. Why didn't you say that earlier, when you… came running into the party? -And where were you? -With the police. That's why she came in a police car. And where is Frank? Oh, that smells great. -Really great. -Well, where is Frank? -How was your birthday, Dad? -You don't care about that. I do. The usual. For he's a jolly good fellow They all look at you and smile. And all I could think about was the pain in my hips. But I'm better off than Herrmann. Katja, I've got to be honest. I'm a bit worried that Herrmann will drag you down. My days here are numbered. Katja, where would you go? We'd miss you if you left. -Well, some would disagree. -You shouldn't pay attention to gossip. Come on, let's have a drink. -Hazelnut schnapps. -Thanks. Right, I'm just going to ask. What do you do for a living? -He's a professor. -No, really? Assistant professor at the university. And that's where you met Antje. -Oh, I mean Edda. -Yes. Exactly. -Really? You've gone back to school? -Sure. I don't believe it. You don't have the stamina. You just hang around with those musicians. You have to prove yourself first. Who gives you 500 euros a month? Does it just appear out of nowhere? I make those Christmas angels. I'm going to eat some more kale. Does anybody else want some? Anybody? Then I'll just put it here. Where is the car now? It doesn't matter, Dad. -It does matter. -Sigi, stop it now. If your car gets stuck, you get a tow truck. Not the police. You don't burst into somebody's party, looking pale as death, and run out again. Then you show up in a police car. I won't be made a fool of. Nobody's making a fool out of you. -You really want to know the truth? -Yes. Fine then. We drove into the woods. -Then we smoked pot. -I knew it. You still do that? Yes. And when we were really stoned, we got horny. -That's too much information. -I think it's great. -But it didn't work. -I don't want to hear any more. My God, Edda, you don't need to talk about that. See? You don't want to know the truth. -But the best is yet to come. -Here we go. While we were in the forest, I-- From the forest, I now appear to proclaim that Christmas is here. Any good children? Any naughty children? Herrmann? You're a bit tipsy, aren't you? -Herrmann, if you're here about business-- -Forget business. You always talk about facts you can't change. You need the courage to create new facts. -Let's go. -It's too late for that. -I'll go with you. -That won't help. Sit down. -It would be best if you left. -You smartass. You got it all wrong. I'm a very generous person. But I'm still human. I have my limits. And if someone comes along… and questions whether I follow through or not… I won't take it. Right. Time for some presents. You didn't put out your boot. But it doesn't matter. What will it be? Sack or rod? Okay, sack. Here's the boot. Nothing inside. No wonder. It hasn't been polished. And for the naughty child, the rod. Got you! Wait! She won't get far. Those beautiful long legs. They run and run. Then they stop running. Saint Nicholas! Fuck this shit. Where is everybody? Are you hiding? That's just like you. Let's do it like we used to when we were kids. I'll count. To ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Here I come! Sweet little kitty. -Bernd! -What? What's going on? -But we just said goodbye. -Please let us come in. -The young man from the party. Come in! -Hello. Where's your gun? You know they took away my hunting license. -Then call the police. -There's no police. -What? -Where's the fuse box? Hang on. Do you need power or the police? What do you mean? Where's Frank? -In the forest. -What's that supposed to mean? -You would have done the same. -Any food or drink? There must be more police. Where's the phone? In the living room. It's so nice that you're here. The line's dead. Yeah, I can explain. I haven't paid the bill. Nobody calls anyway. And if anyone wants to find me, they know where I am. What do you want with the police? Herrmann has lost his mind. Herrmann? Well, he likes to overdo things. But, Sigi, the construction deal was the final straw for him. He's not overdoing it. He's shooting. Oh, that's what that bang was. -Where is he now? -On his way here. We need the police. How about a cell phone? Stop talking about the police. All they do is hand out speeding tickets and type up reports. I've always got along with Herrmann. I'll talk to him. I know him. I've known him since he was a boy. We pretty much raised ourselves back then. Bernd will talk to him. I'll talk to him. Don't do that. What do you know? It's important to talk to each other. I'll talk to him. Herrmann! Herrmann? Herrmann! It's not such a big deal. Let's just have a drink, and then we can see what comes next. You… You're just like me. Come out, smartass. The longer you keep running, the worse it'll be for everyone. What should we do? -Should I go out? -No! Oh, my God, Bernd! Do you want more innocent people to die because of you? Out the front. Go! Come on! Hey! Smartass! This way! Keep quiet. Hey! Ring, little bell Ring-a-ling-a-ling Ring, little bell, ring Children, let me enter 'Tis so cold the winter Katja! We're here. It's just bird shot. Looks worse than it is. And up. Doors to me unclose then Lest I might get frozen MEINHERZ FUNERAL HOME - DAY AND NIGHT -Hello? -Excuse me? Could you let us in? -Could you please let us in? -Please. -What do you want? -We need your help. -What kind of help? -There's a killer out there. -Is the killer German? -Yes. If it's one of us, we'll take care of it. But if he's German, we won't get involved. -It'll only bring trouble. -Seriously? We have instructions. We're not allowed out after 6:00 p.m. Too much trouble with the Germans. It's well past 6:00 p.m. now. But we need your help. I'm sorry. I didn't make this world. Wait. What's all the fuss about? -Herrmann, are you the one shooting? -Wild boar. Those things are real pests. Last weekend, they ate all the potatoes in my shed. -Damn pigs. -Yeah. That's it. Is Norbi here? Just got in. He's watching TV. Get him for me. There are two or three that need gutting. Good. Norbi, could you come here? It's after ten. I'm watching sports. Listen, if I say come, you come. -He's a bit slow sometimes. -What's going o-- -Come on. -Well, don't just stand there. Bundle up or you'll freeze to death. -Do I have to? -Yes. -You don't have to do this. -Yes, I do. -And if he turns around? -Then you'll have to help me. Bravo. You're no better than me. You're worse. From behind! How cowardly is that? Don't worry. He's still breathing. Ah, sit down. Come on. Here. Take it. Some days, beer tastes extra good. Cheers. This sled we're sitting in was a donation from me. Otherwise, this place would be dark. Just because I love Christmas. It's a time to reflect on things. How much do you make? What? How much do you make? Money. It's a set rate. W1. W1? What does that actually mean? Out with it. Four and a half. Four and a half thousand euros? What do you do for it? I do lectures. Lectures? You get four and a half thousand euros for doing lectures? What do you lecture about? No, I don't want to know. Man, I work my ass off, take risks, invest, rack up mountains of debt, and you get that much for doing lectures. I don't feel sorry for you. What's wrong with the world? Wonderful. You know, normally, the loser pays all. But not this time. Don't. This time the loser wins. A time for reflection. None of this had to happen, as is often the case in life. Once again, Christ looks down on his birth, and everything starts from the beginning. But the beauty of it is, we can do things differently, if we want to. I feel sorry about Bernd. Well, he missed Sanne so much. -Now they're together again. -Yes. Now he's happy again. I'm glad you're here. Norbi, don't fall asleep! Herrmann took your guilt to the grave. Loser pays all. You were lucky. Yeah.
