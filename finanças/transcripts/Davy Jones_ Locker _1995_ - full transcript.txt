(crowd chattering) (singers and musicians warming up) - Okay everybody, one minute. One minute. - One minute? One minute for what? - The show, the show! - Oh, the show! The show! - Places, everybody. Places please. - [Man] And where do you think you're going? Oh no, you work down there. - You work down there, you work down there. Grown ups, hmph. - 10 seconds, 10 seconds. Stand by. Ready? - Yeah. - Stand by. House lights to half. And cue. (serene music) - Rich, we're gonna be rich! I tell ya, when I win this sweepstakes, we'll be rich, rich, filthy, filthy rich. - Well, not too filthy, I hope, dear. I just took a bath. Besides, rich won't make you happy, but happy makes you rich. - Huh? - I have you, Joey, and a wonderful home. I feel I'm already rich. - Yeah, but how'd you like to win a million dollar sweepstakes to boot, huh? A little money to make you feel sunny? - Well dear, if it'll make you happy. - Make me happy? Why, you'd be able to have anything in the world you'd want. - You don't need a lot of money for the important things. - Name one important thing that don't cost money. (smooches) Nevermind that. I said name one-- (smooches) Will you please stop that? And name one-- (smooches) Now, cut that out. - Well, that's three, anyway. - Three what? - Three kisses, dear. Would you like three more? - No, no, no, no, now wait. (smooches) Wait a minute. (clock chiming) - Oh my, I'll be late for my meeting at the school. (groans) - Aren't you forgetting something? - Huh? Oh, so I am. - No, no, not that. - Oh, I'm sorry, dear. (smooches) - You should be. - I almost forgot. - How can you forget something as simple as a kiss? - It must've been your million dollar sweepstakes, dear. - My million dollar sweepstakes. How can a sweepstakes be more important than... My million dollar sweepstakes! I almost forgot. The post office. I gotta mail this before they close. - So long, dear. - Joey. Joey! Joey, I need you to mail a letter. - I hope you like it, Joey. - What is it? - It's a book. - Ew. I hate books. - I don't know what I'm gonna do with that boy. I don't know what's the matter with him. Wish we'd had a girl. Joey. - Hi Dad. - [Dad] Didn't you hear me calling you? - Huh? - I've been yelling at the top of my lungs. Here, I want you to take this to the post office before it closes - What is it? - What is it? It's the key to our future's what it is. - You got a job? - This is better than a job, son. This is a sure thing. Here, look, look, look. - Another sweepstakes? Oh, but Dad, you did that already. - That was last time. Look ahead, son. Be positive. Here. Look, look. Look at this, will you? Take a look at this. - This looks like a treasure map! - Our treasure map, son. Just think of it, ours. Think of the riches that lie in store for us. A new car, a mobile home, a trip to Disneyland. Look, son. A million dollars in cash. Think of it. A million smackers. - Oh, I don't know, Dad. - Well what don't you know, huh? We'll have all the things in the world! - Do you really think we need all that? - Need? What's need got to do with it? Stuff, son. Look at all the stuff we'll have. We'll have so much stuff. - I can still keep my room, though. I mean, you wouldn't have to put any of the stuff in my room, would you Dad? I mean, I have all my models that I worked so hard on and everything, and I... - Oh, that's your problem, Joey. You're too much of a dreamer. Models, models. This is the real world, son. Now stop dreaming and get this letter to the post office. - But Dad, I was just in the middle of gluing... Dad, be careful. It's still wet. - What was that? - Dad, you broke it. - Oh, next thing you'll be telling me there are people in there. Now look, take this letter. Mail it, now! (yelling) - Shiver me timbers, right through me looking glass. (chuckles) I don't know how you did it, laddy, but it's so nice to see you drop in. (chuckles) And now, you do have the map, don't you? - The map? - What you have on you. - It's not a map. I'm gonna mail this for my dad, it's a sweepstake. - Sweepstake, flame steak, grub steak, be that as it may, just hand it over. - But... Who are you? Where am I? - I am, that is, we are pirates. I'm Captain Barnacle, and this the S.S. Barnacle. Now give me that map. - Captain, I was just wondering... (grunting) - After him! - Grab him, mates! - Come back here, you little varmint! - Which way'd he go? - He went that way. - Thank you. - I've got him. - You haven't got him, you've got me, you idiot! - Giant eyeball, dead ahead, sir! (yells) (yelling) - Bullseye. (chuckles) As I was saying, laddy. Avarice in Wonderland. Oh, and I'm so tired of being poor. (sobbing) There's nothing sadder than a poor pirate. We've been scraping to make ends meet for so long. A pirate gig at last. So good of you to afford us this opportunity, laddy. - It's not a treasure map, it's a sweepstakes. Can't you read? - Read? Read? We're pirates, laddy. (laughing) I've heard of singing nuns, but reading pirates? (laughing) And besides, who needs to read when we've got your treasure map? Plain as the nose on my face. Why, look here, lads. You are here, the treasure's here. - But captain, that X is not on the land, it's in the water. - That means the treasure's sunken in Davy Jones' locker. - Davy Jones' locker? - All we've got to do is plot a course for 30 degrees latitude by 29 minutes fortitude. We want to go where I put all the holes in the map. So, set the sails, man the mizzenmast, back the oars, up the anchor, down the poop hatch! Do the dishes! - Do the dishes? - I don't know, you're pirates, for gosh sake, you know what to do. So do it! - Aye aye, captain. ♫ Blow mates, blow ♫ The wind is up the sails though ♫ All away ♫ Yuck, that ocean spray ♫ Yo he ho ♫ We follow where the winds blow ♫ Yo ho hum ♫ The question is how come? ♫ I'm Barnacle the buccaneer ♫ From the time the sun has arisen ♫ I work to see the riggen's rigged ♫ And the mizzenmast ain't missing - I'm Shantyman. - Pegleg. - I'm Patch. - And I'm a twin. - Hey, me too. ♫ And you boy, are our prisoner - And it's very nice to meet you. ♫ Blow mates, blow ♫ The wind is up the sails though ♫ All the way ♫ Yuck, that ocean spray ♫ Yo me ho ♫ We follow where the winds blow ♫ Yo ho hum ♫ The question is how come? ♫ They see my ship upon the seas ♫ And all the folks admire it ♫ It ain't much of a life at ease ♫ Life's lonely as a pirate ♫ Let's be clear, those sailors fear ♫ Our yo hos and ahoys ♫ Underneath these broken teeth ♫ We're all still little boys ♫ Blow mates, blow ♫ The wind is up the sails though ♫ All away ♫ Yuck, that ocean spray ♫ Yo me ho ♫ We follow where the winds blow ♫ Yo ho hum ♫ The question is how come? ♫ The question is how come? ♫ The question is how come - How come? - Well now, laddy, now you're getting personal. - Captain, we're making sail, but what's our destination? - The treasure, matey.

X ho! - What was that? - Stop the boat, we're here. (yelling) - You make me seasick, the way you drive. Now, get a gaff hook and haul in that X. - But captain, then how are we going to know where the treasure is? - Because, you bleeding idiot, we already know where it is. (grunting) As soon as we do that, we'll be the only ones who know where the treasure is. - [All] Oh. (chuckling) - Who swims? - Not I, captain. My leg would float. (scoffs) - Where's what's-his-name? - Oh, what's-his-name is down below, getting ready, captain. - Ah, good. Oh good, good. You're here, Shantyman. Now, here's what you need to do. We will tie a line to you. We want you to swim down, find the treasure, tie a rope around it, yank on the line, and we'll pull you up, with the treasure. - Yeah, uh huh. But captain-- - What! - There's just one thing. - What's that? - I can't swim. - What? You can't swim? - I was just gonna take a dip. I wanted to wash the sunscreen off. (groans) - What about you two? - Who two? - You two? - You want to tell him? - Oh, no, you better tell him. - I'm not gonna tell him. He'll get mad. - Well then let's tell him together. - All right. - Our mother never taught us how to swim. - You twits. - That's twins. - What about you? - Oh, captain, well, much as I would consider it an honor and a privilege to risk certain death in a watery grave, my place is here by your side. - Well, we need someone to go over the side. Ah, all right, men. Line up. Now, any man who feels brave enough and courageous enough to volunteer and go down and get the treasure, signify and take one step forward. - Uh oh. (chuckles) - Laddy. So good of you to volunteer. - Huh? But I was in the minnows in my swimming class. - I like a brave lad. Oh yes, yes, yes. Now, all we're going to do, lad, is tie a line around you. Just go down, get the treasure, tie a line around the treasure chest, then we'll haul you and the treasure back up. Three cheers for the brave lad, Joe. - [Joey] But I always use a nose clip! - Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, away! (splashes) (wailing) - You call that scary? I've heard foghorns that were scarier than that. - So you can do better? Go ahead, make my day. (wailing) - Will you two knock it off? I'm trying to eat here. - You with the food, always with the food. If you weren't dead, you'd be big as a house. A haunted house. (laughing) Oh. So nice of you to drop in. - What, he's sitting there? He can't sit there. Nobody can sit there. That's Davy's chair. (piano playing) (laughs) Well, well, well. Methinks we've got a live one here. Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell. Don't he know he's sitting in Davy's chair? Who, who, who is the ruler of this undersea zone. Doesn't he know who the king is? It's Mr. Davy Jones, yeah. - You could have at least called first. (burps) He's losing air. - Whoa, horseys, whoa. Now give my horseys a drink, and watch out, the last time you dented the shell. - I'd like to welcome our ghost of honor, ruler of the undersea, Mr. Davy Jones. - Do you have to do that every time I come in? - Huh? All right. - What, who's this? Excuse me. Excuse me, but you're sitting in my chair. He doesn't seem to get it, does he? I hate these new ghosts. No sense of tradition. - But excuse me, sir. He's not dead yet. - He's dead if I say he's... (moaning) Oh my. You know, you're right. Why does this always happen to me? All right. I'm gonna have to use my magic to save this laddy. Up and down, and all around, I'm gonna give you the juice so you don't drown. ♫ He's Davy Jones, king of the undersea ♫ Davy Jones, king of the undersea ♫ Davy Jones, king of the undersea world - Shut up. - Yeah, knock it off. - Where am I? - Well you're not in Philadelphia, that's for sure. (laughing) You're in Davy Jones' locker. And you're sitting in my rocker! (laughs) - Davy Jones' locker? The ghost king that lives under the sea? But that's just a myth. That's just a story. - Do I look like a myth? (grunts) I'm Davy Jones. I'm king of the undersea. ♫ He's Davy Jones, king of the undersea world Will you shut up! Doesn't strike a chord, huh? You know how long I've been under here, laddy? Centuries. This is my undersea domain, and this is my locker. - Locker? - The whole sea's my locker. - But how can I breathe? - Because I gave you the juice to breathe, kid. Now tell me, laddy. What are you doing in Davy's place? - I came down to get the treasure. - Oh, it's treasure you want? (laughs) Here, how about these three? ♫ He's Davy Jones, king of the undersea ♫ Davy Jones, king of the undersea ♫ Davy Jones, king of the undersea world Can't you see you died once already? Give it a break. Now who sent you? - The pirates. - The pirates. The bane of my existence. But you know, I'd be awfully lonely down here if it weren't for the pirates. How about a drink, laddy? - Oh, no, thank you, Mr. Jones, but I think I've had enough to drink for the day. - Well then, if it's the treasure you want, laddy, follow me.

But perhaps they'll share some of it with you, my boy. - Well, that's okay. Besides, my mother always says, "rich won't make you happy, but happy makes you rich." - Ah. Your mother is a very wise woman, laddy. A very wise woman indeed. - Books? - You see, laddy, these are the real treasures. - But sir, I... - There's a book here I'd like you to take a look at, I... Where is it? It was just here a minute ago. Oceana? Oceana? - [Oceana] Coming. - Please, what happened to the book that was here? - Anna? - Close, son, close. Oceana, the beautiful mermaid of the sea. - Well I was just fixing it. You've opened it so many times, it's gotten a little worn around the edges. - Are you really a mermaid? (laughs) - Why, yes. - Well, here you go, laddy. - But sir, this is just a book. - Just a book? - Just a book! Laddy, this is a magic carpet to take you wherever you want to go. It's a tool, to teach you to build anything you want to build. It's the key to the treasures in your heart. ♫ Books are the key, ♫ The treasure's your heart ♫ Read and the treasure chest opens ♫ Open me, here look, Guinevere ♫ And all of her knights in all of their gear ♫ Page after page, it's here on these pages ♫ Oh what a joy to read ♫ I tell a tale of men who sail ♫ In mad pursuit of a great white whale ♫ I make models floating in bottles ♫ Oh what a joy to read ♫ Open me there and hold your chair ♫ I'm dropping you in Trafalgar Square ♫ Where's Kathmandu? ♫ Page 72! ♫ Oh, the boy can read ♫ When you hook your fingers on a book ♫ Before your hand is curled ♫ Halfway around the world ♫ Books are the key, ♫ The treasure's your heart ♫ That's not the treasure chest, this is ♫ Here there's no loss ♫ Pirates can't steal ♫ What's in your heart - I love books. - Well, there you go then, laddy. Read it and reap. - But what about the pirates? - They're gonna love this book. - But I-- - No no no no no, no buts about it. I'm telling you, you have no idea what they're gonna do to you. All right. I'll see you later. Goodbye, laddy. Read it and reap, laddy! - I hope this works. (seagulls cawing) - There he is, captain! There he is! - Where? - Three branch off the starboard bow! - Quick, mates, throw him a line. Reel him in, mates. Reel him in. (laughs) Welcome back, laddy. Welcome back. We didn't think you were going to make it. How'd you stay down that long? - Well, it was... It was very interesting. There was a mermaid, and I met Davy Jones. (laughing) - Excellent, excellent, yes, laddy. That's very good. Oh, Davy Jones, yeah. Get him an aspirin, he's suffering from the bent. The deep sea sickness. A light touched. Now, about the treasure, laddy. - Oh, yes, the treasure. Yes, I got the treasure, and it's... - Well where is it, laddy? Where is it? - The treasure? It's... Why, it's down below. - Down below? - It was, then I brought the treasure up. - Oh, I knew he could do it, I knew he could do it. That's my lad, that's my lad. I knew you wouldn't let us down. Well, let's see it, laddy. Let's see what you've got. - Here it is, sir. - What's this? - Well, it's a book. - Oh. (laughing) He hid it in the book. Good one, laddy. It's in the book, it's in the book, he hid it in the book. It's in the book, it's in the book, he hid it in the book. (laughing) - But captain, captain look, there's nothing in this book but pages. It's all pages. It's just paper. - Oh, I knew this wasn't going to work. - What? Just paper? What kind of a... (growling) Laddy, we trusted you, but all you brought us was a bleeding book? (growling) You traiter. You'll die for this, you little rascal you. - Captain, captain. - Don't bother me, I'm killing the kid. - But captain... - Don't bother me when I'm working. I've got a sword in my hand, it's dangerous. You never talk to someone when he's got a sword in his hand, someone could get hurt. - But killing this kid... - Now don't bother me. - But it's you in the book. - What, what am I doing in there? - Well, look. - Why, it is me. I mean, well, the hair's all wrong, but it's me. - But what does it say, captain? - What does it say, what does it say? - Well, well, it says... It says... I don't know what it says. I can't read. - Well, I can read, sir. I can read it to you. - Well then, tell us, laddy, what does it say? - [Pirates] Yeah, what's it say? - It says right here, this is Captain Horatio Cornelius Barnacle. - Why, it's my great-great-great-granddaddy, the greatest pirate of them all. (laughs) What is this book, laddy? - Why, it's the Who's Who in Piracy. - Oh. Now that makes me feel rich. And to think, my great-granddaddy is in the Who's Who in Piracy. - It says born 1760, died 1815. Captain Horatio Cornelius Barnacle was really a kind of minor player in the pirate game, and he was also associated with such other crooks as Blue Beard, Green Beard, Black Beard, Purple Beard... (laughing) - It makes a man feel rich to know that his ancestors had been recognized for the greatness that they'd done. The ships they sunk, the pillaging, the plunder, the lives they've ruined, the treasure that they... The treasure. (grunts) But that's why we're here. And who's going to get the treasure, Joey, my lad? - But I just came out of the sea. - Just again laddy, think of this as a sea-quel. (laughing) - But, are you sure you want me to-- - Leave that book here. - You know, I might not come back up, and then you'd have no one to read-- Nevermind! (splashes) Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones. - Ah, my boy. Taking a liking to this, are you? Well I can't keep you breathing down here forever, you know. - But Mr. Jones, sir, the book. - Ah, they liked the book, did they? - They liked the book, but they want the gold. - The gold, eh? If you give a man a doubloon, he'll spend the doubloon. But if you teach him how to find gold, he'll be rich forever. Here, laddy. Take them this book. This'll make them happy. - Huh? How to find buried treasure? - You give a man a loaf of bread, you feed him for a day. But you teach him how to fish, and he'll be fat forever. Read it and reap, laddy. Read it and reap. - Why do I feel I've been through this? (playing accordion) - I'm back. - Ah, laddy. Did you get the gold? - No, no, but I got this book that teaches you how to find gold, and Davy Jones said that if you find the gold, you'll be fat, I mean, if you have the fish, if you teach a fish how to swim, they'll be fat forever. (growls) - Are you calling me a fat fish? - Nevermind! (splashes) - Not bad. - Fancy diver. - Much improved. (sighs) - I've been waiting for you, laddy. - Ain't that the truth. Give them a claw, and they want the whole lobster. - It always comes to this, doesn't it? - Always has. Always will. - I can't do this again. I come up there with another book, I'm dead. They'll kill me. If I can't go back up with the gold, I can't go back up. I'll have to live here with you. And Oceana. That wouldn't be so bad. - No, Joey. This is not your world. - But-- - Pirates are pirates, my lad. I've given them a chance to redeem themselves, but ah well, if it's the gold they want, then it's the gold they shall have. Take it to them, laddy. It's theirs. - The cares of the day just seem to float away when I bathe in gold. If we could only package this stuff, we'd make a fortune. - But captain, you're sitting in a fortune. - Ah, but you can never have too much. Remember, mateys, nothing exceeds like excess. (laughing) - Oh boy. - My towel please, Pegleg. - Here you are, captain. - Thank you. - It's my pleasure. (laughs) - It was a wonderful experience. But now, there's work to be done. - Wait wait wait. - No no no. No no no no no, captain, no. No work gets done before we get our gold. - Here here. - Ah, but mateys. Look. There's more than enough for everyone. - Then let's get our more than enough. - I want my cut. - I want my share of more than enough. - How much would my share of more than enough be, captain? - Well, let's see. There's more than enough, divided by the captain's share, which comes out to be a little bit less than, well... Something. Bah. - But captain, you said there'd be more than enough for everyone. How come I'm winding up with a little bit less than something? - Because everyone winds up with a little bit less than something. And then you die. And besides, I'm the captain, matey, and you're something else. And if you're something else, then anything that you would have on you would be less. (laughs) - Oh. ♫ Less than that - [Pegleg] Watch out below! ♫ That gold, sir, give me that gold ♫ I want it, you want it, we want it ♫ Nothing's just like gold ♫ You'd be strobed, sir, minute and row ♫ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful bags of gold, gold, gold ♫ Deciding, dividing up each share ♫ Deciding, dividing, let's be fair ♫ Look at these coins ♫ Shine, glitter, and flash ♫ Always something warm in a swarm of cold hard cash ♫ Jingle and clink, ♫ Boys, jingle and clank ♫ Listen and behold, such a mountain of gold ♫ And walk the plank ♫ Deciding, dividing up each share ♫ Deciding, dividing, let's be fair ♫ Dividing, deciding, lots of gold ♫ Give me that, give me that, give me that, give me that ♫ Give me that, give me that, give me that... ♫ Gold - [Shantyman] I can't move. - [Barnacle] Of course you can't move. Pick the gold out of your pockets. - Well, I'm not going to do that. I've got the gold. Why would I give up the gold? - Because you can't move. - Well, there's got to be a-- - This isn't any fun. I've got all this gold, and I can't do anything. - I thought being rich would be fun. I'm just sitting here in the hot sun on the deck of this darn ship, and I can't do nothing, I can't go nowhere, I can't move, nothing. - Yeah, but you're rich. - My pockets are full, but my heart is empty. What can I do to fill up my heart? - I don't understand this. It wasn't two hours ago we were all up here and we were happy. And now we're filthy rich, and we're miserable. Well, what were we doing? - Joey was reading us a story. - Uh oh. - Joey can read us a story, we'd be rich and we'd be happy. - [Pirates] Read us a story, Joey. - This is Who's Who in Piracy. - Oh, not that one, we've heard that one. (groans) - But this is the only book I've got. - What we need is, we need books. - Lots of books, enough books so we never have to hear the same story twice. - Books, books, books, books, books, books, books. - Joey. Your job is clear. - But I just-- - Just again, laddy. - I'm going, I'm going. Just never happy, more more more, they want the gold, you get them the gold, now they want the books, it's like these guys are never satisfied. And tell you, what's it gonna be next? - Joey. - Don't. Even. Think about it. (yelling) (splashes) - Books. - Books? Oh, they took my gold, and now they want my books? They've got all the riches in the world. - But it hasn't made them happy. - Well I can't make them happy, laddy. They have to learn to do that themselves. - But there must be something we can do. I mean, there must be some way to work this out. If I go up there empty-handed, that's it, I'm finished. - Ah. But you know, I might have a thought. - You do? I mean, you might? - A proposition, you might say. - A proposition? - Aye. Perhaps even a golden proposition. (giggles) - Gold? Gold, for books? Why, that's piracy. - Yeah. And who would know more about that than you, captain? - Shut up, you. Don't interrupt me while I'm extolling. This is the most cutthroated thing I've ever heard in all my days, since the lass and the cutthroat. I will not have others do unto me as I do unto them. I'm the pirate in this thing. Has he no ethics? Can you imagine? This guy's as bad as a bank. He wants us to throw over our gold in exchange for books. Well, we know what the answer to that will be, don't we mateys? - I want my books. - Me too, I want my books. - But you can't, we've agreed. - Well, they could always send away for a correspondence course. - A what? - A correspondence course. Where you send away, and they send you lessons, and you can learn how to read. - Argh. Are we gonna let this lily-livered codfish, this geriatric undersea pumpkinhead, this tyrannical pirateer push us around? And take our gold? What's it going to be, men? Are we pirates, or are we bookworms? Ah, I knew you'd go along with me, men. What are you doing? - Look, I can make it skip. - All right, mates. Let her rip! - Now look what you've done. - Joey. Read us a story, lad. Please, read us a story. (groans) - The damage is done, my boy. The damage is done. - Okay. - Ah, the lad's going to read to us, mates. Oh, get out of my way. - I can't see. - Shantyman, get off of my head. - Hey, I was here first. - No, I was. - No, I was. - No, I was. - [Twin] No, I was. - Ow. - Ow. - That's using the old peg. (clears throat) (shushing) - I want to hear the story. - The name of this book is Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson. This is a story about pirates in search for treasure. - Lived it. - Been there. - Done that. - It's about a kid who becomes the owner of a treasure map that leads them to a fortune in stolen gold? - Yeah. - Mates. - What? - There's a storm coming in from the southeast. - Aww. (thunder crashes) - Man the mizzenmast. Tuck the sails. Back the yacht, and put a pot of coffee on the heat. You know about addition and subtraction and all those things now, don't you? - Huh? - Well lad, come with me, because I have to go down below and count my gold, I mean, tally my lobsters. - You mean, we're leaving? I've got to say goodbye to Oceana. - Who's Oceana? - Well, she's the mermaid. - Oh, yes, yes. No no, lad, I'm sorry, there's no time, we've got to set sail. We're sitting ducks in this lagoon. - I have to say goodbye to Oceana. We wouldn't have any of this if it weren't for her. - Laddy, I'm sorry. - I've got to say-- - But laddy, we can't wait! - Oceana. Oceana. Oceana. Oceana. - Joe. - I thought I would never see you again. - I'm here, Joe. - Oceana, there's a horrible storm up above. The pirates have to leave, and I have to leave with them. But I couldn't go without saying goodbye to you. - I'll miss you, Joe. - I'll miss you too, Oceana. I don't want to leave. - But you must. - Couldn't you come back with me? - I don't think so, Joe. The sea is my home. - But I don't want to say goodbye. - Nor do I.

We've got to warn the boy. (clinking) - They're signaling you, Joe. You must leave now. You haven't any time left. - I won't leave you, Oceana. I won't. I won't, I... - Oh no, the spell. The spell that enabled you to exist in our world is wearing off. You must leave, Joe, you must. Or you'll drown. Goodbye, Joe. Goodbye. I'll never forget you. - [Barnacle] Got you, laddy. - Oceana. - [Barnacle] I got you. - Oceana. Anna. Anna. Anna. - [Anna] I'm here, Joe. I'm here. - [Joey] We made it. - [Anna] Who did, Joey? - All those books. - Are you all right? - Huh? Anna. What are you doing here? - Are you okay, son? - The letter. Dad, I didn't mail the letter. I'm sorry, I let you down. - That's okay, son. You didn't let me down. The riches of my family are worth more to me than all the gold in the world. - Gold! Dad! I know where there's all the gold in the world! - Son, why don't we go upstairs so you can lie down and get some rest. - You've taken a terrible fall. - Oh, I'm fine, Mom. Honest. - Well, I'd better get going. - Anna, can I call you later? - Sure. Bye. - What do you say, son? - Okay, Dad. - [Mom] What's this, dear? - Oh. That's the book that Anna gave me. - Why don't you read it, dear? And maybe it'll help you fall asleep. - I love you, Mom. I love you, Dad. - We love you too, son. - Davy Jones' Locker. Dear Joey, don't ever let go of your dreams. Love, Anna. Once upon a time, long, long ago, there lived a pirate king under the sea whose name was Davy Jones. Davy was the richest of kings, not only for his gold, but for all his golden books as well, which he treasured more than all the possessions in the world. When he read his books, (yawns) Davy could imagine all the places he'd never been, and this made him happier than all the gold in the world.

And the answer of course is yes. They're just puppets with strings. The puppeteers work from above, as you can see, on platforms we call bridges. While making Davy Jones' Locker, we had as many as eight puppeteers operating at any one time. Well, now you can see how we did the water. A very thin material known as China silk, and a couple of fans blowing from underneath. Some of the best effects are not always high tech. The picture is shot to what is called playback. The soundtrack is recorded first, and the puppeteers work to what they're hearing. ♫ I'm Barnacle the buccaneer from the time the sun has risen ♫ I work to see the riggin's rigged - [Joe] We keep the camera moving as much as possible. Marionettes are wonderful, you know, but they really can't do a whole lot for themselves. One of the things you have to help them with is a sense of flow and movement. The camera goes a long way in making that possible, and becomes as much a character in a way as the characters themselves. That fellow on the left there is our assistant camera man and he makes sure everything is in focus. Now this is called a subjective shot, where the camera booms up and takes Joey's point of view. The camera here, in a sense, is Joey. The underwater effect is created by a translucent screen lit from behind and the ships hull is actually a small model glued to the screen. Even that point of view shot where Joey goes down to Davey's place, well that's a model, no bigger than a bread box. And that's Peter Baird manipulating our miniature pirate ship with a magnet. The model here is only three and half inches long. - [Man] Did you unplug the coffee maker? - [Man] I don't know. - [Man] You don't know if you did or not? - [Man] I'm not sure, did you? - [Man] Well why don't you know? You never know. - [Man] I'm asking you a simple question. - [Man] I plugged it in... - [Joe] You'll notice that Devey's seahorses are marionettes that are being manipulated from below as well as above. In this scene, we had a total of five puppeteers operating. - I give my horsies a drink. And watch out! The last time you dented the... (mumbling) - [Joe] That TV monitor I'm looking at as we're shooting the scene shows me exactly what the camera is filming. That's known as a video tap. And that's what's known as a very frustrated director. You'll notice the puppeteers have to watch what's going on below and at the same time, watch what the camera is filming. Their eyes have to be in two places at one time. It's a tricky business. - King that lives under the sea? But that's just a myth. - [Joe] And again that camera moving back adds motion to a static scene. The woman sitting on my left is our script supervisor. Now, she keeps track of all the shots we've done and the ones that remain. She also has to remember where the characters were standing, who was doing what, what they were wearing, what they were holding, who was looking at who. It helps to have a great memory. Especially since the scenes are filmed out of sequence. The one thing about puppets, you know, they don't remember anything. If you're wondering why we have Davey walking on boxes, it's to raise him up. That's so we can see the wall hangings behind him. And there's Mr. Jones getting himself lit. That black card is known as a flag and flags are used to block light or direct light to specific areas. No, this is not Gulliver's Travels, that's Peter adjusting a string on one of the dancing books. In fact, the sets, the props are not only built to scale of marionettes in mind, even the walls of the sets, as you can see here, are easily removable. And that's how the camera can actually get into the pirates cabin and boom up behind the character or even get closer to a character. You have to create an atmosphere in order to life them. So we used the smoke machine and that helped give the library a warm magical glow. - [Man] Smoke is up! - [Joe] We generally rehearse and block a scene before we shoot it. Here's Davey and Joey and the puppeteers going through their paces. And there's a director who's telling his actors to go back and do it again. - [Child] Just a book? - Just a book! This is a magic carpet to take you wherever you want to go. It's a tool. - [Joe] Our piano player Slugger Ryan is actually a (mumbles) and he takes two puppeteers to operate from underneath. While watching the monitor, one puppeteer manipulates the hands and arms, while the other animates his body and mouth. You know, I have to admit, Slugger is my favorite Baird puppet and has been since my childhood. I have a feeling you'll be seeing him again. ♫ It's Mr. Davey Jones.
