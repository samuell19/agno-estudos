of course you haven't even touched your breakfast of course he told me about you when mark talks about this city he means dave brody yeah but watch out for him he's a collector of unwary females only

coffee would you like some no thank you i think i'll uh get ready to go out think you'll be home for lunch what hearing things again i don't know so strange miss sam in elaine's room how long since the fun's been used two years why i woke up last night and i thought i heard someone crying in her room talking on the telephone ghosts i went in there and there was no one there what did mark say i couldn't tell him he'd think i was being silly come over here come on now take a look willard street 20th century the hollywood hills are up that way in that direction's pasadena round use the city of los angeles you'll see it all when you go out now you tell me what self-respecting ghost would want to live in a place like this uh oh so so the other one three years ago didn't want to break the pair but he talked me into it said it was a birthday present careful isn't it it's not the same tune well that'd be foolish one of them is sad and one is gabe you're a very lucky person young lady why is that well i didn't sell i put it in my store room just today i decided to give it another try you know when i put it in the window maybe 15 minutes ago but isn't it strange i mean all day i've been hearing the tune from that music box and then i practically fell into the store where you bought it no i didn't buy it i hated the thing oh the man said i didn't buy it laura so let's drop it please uh i'm sorry i'm gonna have to drag mark away after dinner but we do have a few editorial things we have to clean up at the office yeah i promised my secretary in tokyo i'd call her before she went to lunch starting tomorrow he is all yours i promise honest engine fine mark tell me about elaine what was she like why curious she was a sweet troubled girl where did you meet her a gun quit maine she was in summer stock she was an actress i didn't know that was she good well not really oh she pretty laura this is silly was she yes barry what happened to her mark how'd she die mark what happened to her take the advice of an expert never marry a curious girl why can't you tell me is it a secret do you know yes she tried to eat and talk at the same time couldn't make it dave i'm serious darling it's getting late we have to put you in a taxi and get back to the office we'll talk about it later all right yes who is it i hope i'm not disturbing you oh laura child please come in close the door come and sit down you said you wanted to talk to me sit down please was it about elaine did mark come home with you no laura i want you to do something for me i want you to get mark to leave this house and i want him to do it tonight but that doesn't make sense maybe it's because i'm growing old maybe that's why maybe when you move closer to death the dead move closer to you how much do you know about elaine i know that she's dead did you know that she died here in this house in the room at the end of the hall no no i didn't know that death isn't the end it can't be not if there's something left unfinished how did she die what happened she's still in this house i know it laura since the day you and mark were married since that very day i've i've felt it behind me and when i've turned around there's there's no one there a ghost call it what you like a presence a feeling a a will there's something of the lane in this house and mark must not stay no one really believes in ghosts won't you understand elena's here and she's vicious laura i'm trying to help you mark wouldn't listen to me but but you must you must i don't know what to say don't say anything just do it think i'm mad but do it i'll wait for mark to get home then you'll go yes i'll talk to him about it laura thank you child so so don't you know lay yes wow thank you how is she she'll be all right you won't be if you don't relax relax you didn't hear the awful screaming no i'm dr carpenter laura mark oh mark it was so horrible i thought she was here right here in this room oh it all seemed so real she was talking to me and then i don't know i'm so cold and frightened of course you were but it's all right now i'm so glad you're here mrs m found you you fainted mrs sam you heard her you must have heard her i didn't hear anyone but you what you need right now is sleep now this will help it was he late she was here but laura elaine's dead she was here right in this room she's dead you know that i don't care mark i know what i heard you must have heard it mrs wilson you've had a long trip you're in a strange place your nerves are bound to be on edge now maybe you heard something or maybe you only thought you did i don't know but i do know you've had a severe shock and you need rest now come on take this come on do what he says come on did my mother talk to her mark mark i'm frightened there's nothing to be afraid of please stay with me you get some sleep come on lie down and do what the doctor says and remember i'll be very near if you need me i'm gonna have a talk with my mother you'll be all right i was wrong i thought it would be you but it's laura she's the one mark you've got to get her out of the house tonight because she's my wife yes oh mark it's not what you think i i have nothing against her she seems like a nice sweet girl mother what did you do mark it's beginning she can't stay i want to know what you said to me if you get her out of the house tonight you'll both still be safe safe from what in lane oh don't be ridiculous mother elaine's dead she can't do anybody any harm now where are you going i'm going to talk to laura sarah you'll do nothing the kind now you'll stay away from that girl if i have to tie you down myself she's been frightened enough for one night get out of this house oh sarah what's he doing here well i sent for him i'm sorry i thought you knew knew what this is still my house and i don't want him in it all right sarah just don't be foolish now leave her alone stay away from her and let her sleep i'll talk to you later no not later no mark what about laura laura is my responsibility mother you let me worry about her all right what was all that about well two years ago after elaine died after you left it was all quite a shock to your mother well i could never have stayed here i know i know anyway i came to see her i knew how destructive she'd been elaine your mother battleground maybe i shouldn't have done it but i told her i thought that's why elaine drank so much oh i guess i didn't use my best bedside manner she's never forgiven me okay why can't we see our mistakes when we're making them sam i should have known exactly what would have happened if i brought elaine here to live nobody knows such things i loved her and i killed her nonsense she shot herself she did it not you and it's ended nothing ever ends yes it does mark let it go i can't do you know i've never been able to tell laura how much i love her if you don't mind i'd like to stay around a while and have another look at her i thought it might end when i fell in love with her but it didn't i even thought that if i brought her here everything would change but it doesn't work you think you've pushed it away but it's still right there hey laura oh mrs wilson they don't want me to talk to you where's mark downstairs laura i don't have much time it was a lane wasn't it i don't know i thought i heard her but i don't know maybe i'm going out of my mind she was here i want to see mark laura try to understand elaine was here that's not possible she's dead laura the barrier between life and death is weak very weak but between death and life it's almost impregnable she can't reach through not alone not without help i know that now and so she waits she waits then someone comes laura you have to get away before it happens before what happens mrs wilson what can happen she'll use you she'll use you to harm my son that's ridiculous you didn't know her she was strong and vengeful and possessive and demanding and she can possess your body she can do it but mark why would she want to hurt mark it can happen again and this time you may not be able to get away why would she want to hurt him dear god make her see does it matter what did he do to her he he killed her he killed her now do you understand i've never said anything to anyone not a good mark but i know mark couldn't do a thing like that they were in that room they'd had quarrels before but this was she was always trying to turn mark against me i heard him shouting steady killer i don't believe it you think i want to believe it he's my son later i heard the shot and then i heard him running down the stairs and by the time i got to the hallway he was gone i still hear it over and over again the shot the footsteps that shot the foot i went into their room and she was dead the gun was i picked it up i wiped it off i put it in her hand and i told the police she'd killed herself they were very sympathetic we had a permit for the gun they even returned it's not true none of it laura she's here and she's waiting she'll want you to kill him no laura you say you love him help him leave me alone why can't you leave me alone you come back again i know she i'm trying how long before it takes effect well just a few minutes they'll probably have to carry her upstairs lane it was lame it's dying that'll make you sleep and then everything will be all right what yes i don't want to hurt you listen you go to sleep i love you do you think it would be better if i took her to the hotel oh i wouldn't disturb her until morning she'll sleep all night now come on i've got some coffee for you you uh you believe in ghosts oh oh spirits yes ghosts no in a bottle nighty proof matter of fact we could use some right now is there any in the house i suppose somewhere i never did find all of elaine's hiding places you know maybe elaine is still in this house don't do it mark don't do it so hmm uh who is it who is it laura what do you want i have to talk to you it's important please i need your help close the door are they going to let you leave i asked you to close the door now we can talk laura yes mother no mother we'll talk right here you are not laura no isn't that ridiculous you really mustn't go around saying that sort of thing mother or people might think you belong in an institution please the gun mother please you said the police returned the gun where did you put it please leave me alone that's entirely up to you mother it all depends on whom you want to protect most mark or yourself i think i know the answer laura laura laura mother have you seen mother what is it what happened mother have you seen laura i tried to warn you i did i tried to warn you i did so sam laura's not in her room what i went to my mother and asked her where she is but i don't know what it is she's not making any sense you better take a look at it laura what do you mean sneaking up behind me spying on me what are you doing out here i wanted to feel the wind find that so strange do you doctor frankly yes i find it most strange i don't know how you managed to stay on your feet i'm perfectly all right my dear girl the amount of sedation i pumped into you i don't understand it i said i was all right i've never seen her like this well maybe it's time you did i'm sorry darling i must be more nervous than i thought you certainly are young lady you'd better get her back into bed all right doctor mark i'm going to see your mother come on let's go inside let's sleep in the other bedroom tonight what for i know it was elaine's room but i don't care please darling it's been like living in a grave so lonely i never wanted to be alone no one wants to be alone help me please good night mother come on darling keep her away from me laura she's not laura what oh oh i see and if she's not laura who is she what are you doing remembering do you like this room no i love it i always did what when i was a little girl i used to have a dream a very special dream when i did something wrong i dream i woke up and it was yesterday and i had a second chance then i'd really wake up and it would be tomorrow and i didn't have a second chance at all but it'll be different now darling won't it i don't think we should stay in here are you afraid i don't understand you when dave gets here i want to see him dave he'll be here and i want to see him listen you promised the doctor you'd get see who it is darling hmm no no there's no such thing as spirit possession it's a superstition with no basis in fact you saw her she was different she wants to hurt mark but why sarah if anyone's in danger it's that poor girl and you have only yourself to blame i knew you'd say that now you listen to me some people need a great deal of reassurance in unfamiliar surroundings like this they become more uncertain more insecure extremely open to suggestion you terrified that girl i told her the truth i'm trying to protect the way you protected him from elaine when she was alive i'm sorry sarah but there's more than one kind of possession she told me she said you want to see me oh come on laura what happened to the music box do you want to catch cold i want it open doesn't we have enough trouble i said i want it open laura why are you behaving like this shut the door dave go ahead close it davey better much better and cozy all in one room my second chance mark i told you i'd have it this time did you know about that all i know is that you said you wanted to see me why yes i did laura what did you do to the to the music box it broke you always did say i had a terrible temper remember i don't know what you're talking about you didn't know he bought it for me did you look i i swear i don't know what you're talking about laura laura but that's not my name look at me mark don't you know who i am yes you're you're laura laura laura laura is that all you can see there is no laura there is no laura you don't believe me do you you didn't believe her either she tried to warn you so did your mother laura please you don't know me and once you said you'd never forget me mark i'm so disappointed in you but you know me don't you davey you never knew about us did you how we used to laugh at you high rise apartments explore rear i've still got the key davey what is this some sort of game punish the murderer kill the man who killed me nobody killed you laura you're standing right here he's not gonna get the doctor stop treating me like a child i know exactly what i'm doing no you don't you're insane no no i'm not maybe you're laura is but not i but you are laura you make me sick you always did running to mama for everything well my dear this is one time you should have listened to her i'll get the doctor no i think i want you to stay i'm not sure why but you have to stay all right then i'll get him no he's in the other room i don't want him here hey close the door lock it now move away from it take it easy please give it to me there is no laura they used to think insanity was a sign of possession devils possessed by devils did you think i was a devil when we were married it's not possible your mother knew me the moment she saw me i've waited two years to kill you i had something to wait for it's her it's lane elaine died she's dead that's in lane it's over waiting over why should you do this to laura there was no other way why her you know what they'll do to her you killed your first wife why not your second but i didn't and if you are elaine you must know that i didn't i knew you're a murderer but that's not true who should know better than i don't you remember you've been drinking i took the bottle away from you and i made you furious i know what happened do you maybe you don't when it happened you were so drunk you didn't know what you were doing you never knew try to remember come on it all started with a music box you wanted to play at night to get away from you and you threatened to kill yourself your mother knows the truth how could she she was asleep i walked out on you elaine i walked out and left you alone don't you remember you said you'd kill yourself and i walked out on you i know now i should never have left you but that's not killing i didn't kill you elaine she heard the footsteps and the shot you know i'm not a murderer you know there's no reason to hug laura so let her come back to me please oh he walked out i was alone laura laura listen to me elaine says there is no laura but it can't be elaine's dead she's in the past and you've got a fighter it's your only chance fight her why can't i remember don't let the past come between us don't let elaine come and take you away from me you're all that matters to me now please he killed me he killed me dave it was dave an accident it was an accident (Dramatic Music) (Commotion) (Drives Off) will she be all right? yeah why don't you go back up to bed. mark... mother don't please those two terrible years how could i ever have thought it was you? it doesn't matter it's all over now please don't hate me nobody hates anyone Celia why would you ever want to stay on well why should i go anyplace else? no more ghosts how did she know about Dave? pure chance maybe i'll never believe there was a ghost. anyway it was you brought laura out of it by appealing to her insecurity you told her how important she was to you and that's what you wanted to hear cherish your mark it's what we all need most it's an old bromide but it happens to be true i'll check back in the morning i'm sorry darling mark elaine's still here no no she's gone i can feel her presence now you think about it everything that happened to you happened after my mother suggested it would whatever you heard was in your own hand that's all it was suggestion not possession why did you marry me because i love you because i love you very much (Dramatic Music)
