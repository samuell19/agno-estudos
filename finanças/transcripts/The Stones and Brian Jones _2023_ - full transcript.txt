"Brian was a casualty of war beetween two generation" STANLEY BOOTH, BIOGRAPHER THE STONES & BRIAN JONES A child is a thing to be loved. A child is the manifestations of both parents, and both parents see themselves in the child. VOICE OF BRIAN JONES FOUNDER OF THE ROLLING STONES The child is part of them. He is their flesh and blood. And for good many years, he is a reflection of their personality. So when he grows up, one day he's going to assert his own personality, which might very well differ from the personalities and outlooks of his parents. Immediately, his parents feel very upset. You know, they don't see themselves in him any more. And when these parents don't see themselves in him, they feel they've lost him. HISTORICAL CONSULTANT BILL WYMAN But really, he's become a human being in his own right. HISTORICAL CO.PRODUCERS SUZANNE ACCOSTA WYMAN IAN GRENFELL Brian's troubled relationship with his parents would affect him throughout his life. BRIAN JONES' VOICE RECREATED BY FREDDIE FOX His parents disapproved of his lifestyle. ADDITION MUSIC BY NICK LAIRD - CLOWES They wanted Brian to have a proper job like his father. At the age of just 19, he formed the Rolling Stones. They were the first of their kind and drove people crazy with their long hair and their contempt for convention and authority. Let's introduce you Stone by Stone to the Rolling Stones. Hello, I'm Mick Jagger. Charlie Watts. - Who? - Charlie Watts. Brian Jones. Keith Richard. - Bill Wyman. On the question of hair, boys, you're pretty long in the hair. What's the point of long hair these days? I believe it's going out in England and it's going out in Australia. .... ? - You thought of anything different, like plaiting your hair or anything like this? Ha, ha, ha. - We've got a comedian here, I see. I believe some of the Eastern States groups have even suggested that you're effeminate. What have you got to say about this? - Well, darling... - Well, we're not, you know. I met Brian on a train as a schoolboy, aged 14. I was surprised how open and friendly he was, with a soft spoken middle class accent. He said he was a train spotter and this was his favourite line, The Great Western. I remember the shock when hearing he had died tragically just six years later. He seemed at the time to have the world at his feet. Thank you very much. # Everybody wants somebody # Everybody wants somebody # Everybody needs somebody # Everybody... VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE I loved Mick and Keith. BRIAN'S GIRLFREND 1962 - 1964 And Mick always was in awe of Brian. He absolutely loved him and I think he wanted to be Brian. # Everybody wants somebody BRIAN # Everybody # needs somebody... Cos he had all the girls and he had all the fan mail. # Someone to love # Someone to kiss... And Mick was trying really hard... to get girlfriends, I think, at that time. # Someone to please # Sometimes a squeeze... That was what I remember, that he was very impressed with the way that Brian could just draw women to him. # I need you, you, you... To Brian and Keith, it was like a brother relationship. I saw Keith so fascinated with the way Brian played and Brian showing him certain guitar things. # I need you # Yes, I do... And so they were very close. They were all... rowing together in this musical journey. Ladies and gentlemen, LONDON it's all about to happen. LONDON Let's hear it for the fantastic Rolling Stones! # I'm all right # I'm all right # I'm all right # I'm all right # I'm all right # Whoa, whoa, whoa # Come on down # Come on down # Come on down... Brian then, was as popular and famous as Mick. He was the heart and soul of the early Stones. Yet most people today haven't even heard of him. Brian answered most of the fan mail. "Dear Doreen, many thanks for your letter "and the great interest you've shown in the band. "The band is really an amalgamation of two bands, "the one being an R&B band I formed the year ago "and the other being a group run by Mick and Keith in South East London. "We have, I might add, a habit of breaking audience attendance records." VOICE OF BILL WYMAN In the early days, who got all the fan mail? BASS PLAYER Brian. The secretaries told me, "Well, we get about 100 letters. "About 60 of them are for Brian, "about 25 are for Mick, about 10 for Charlie and Keith. "And there's about the same for you, you know, and that's it, you know? "But Brian gets all the fan mail." He was brilliant, a brilliant musician. He shocked everybody with the quality of his playing. We all dedicated ourselves to the band and Brian more so than anybody else, because it was his band in the beginning. So it meant the world to him more than it did to the rest of us. Brian did everything. He wrote in the music papers. He discussed things about the origins of what is actually the blues and what is R&B. There's all those letters and things. I've got copies of them. When Brian advertised for a band, he chose every single person to come into his band. Let's recap on the Rolling Stones. How did you all get together in the first place? Actually, I answered an advert for a bass player, so... But the rest of them got together individually, in jazz clubs and formed a sort of a group. How long ago was that? - Two years. And what were you doing when you answered the advertisement? Engineering, actually. And we'll move on now to Brian. How long have you been with the Rolling Stones? Are you one of the original members? Yes, one of the original members. - What were you doing before you joined? Well, just sort of bumming around, waiting for something to happen, really. I had quite a few jobs and I was trying to get a band going, but it was unsuccessful until I met up with Mick and Keith and then that was a successful band. Well, can you think back to your first engagement? Where was that? Erm... Marquee, Oxford Street, London. And may I ask how much you got paid for that assignment? 20 quid, which was good, because u months later, we were still working for 10 quid. # It's all right # It's all right, children # It's all right # It's all right, children # It's all right # Come on around, baby # Come on around, baby # Come on around, baby # Come on around, baby # Come on around, baby... Mick used to stand in front of us. Mick's got the maracas and the audience just joining in and all that. # Do you feel it, baby # Yeah, yeah, yeah # Do you feel it now # My, my, my... It just got right into your body and it was like a tribal gathering. # All right, all right, all right # All right, all right, all right # All right, all right, all right # All right, all right, all right # All right, all right, all right. The blues were everything to Brian. He saw the Stones as promoting unknown black blues music. "Dear Doreen, you raised the point in your letter about blues material. "You must appreciate that blues are not easy to put over to the average club audience. "They prefer something more in the twisting and jumping run. "Once again, thank you for your interest in rhythm and blues and ourselves. "It's wonderful music and deserves more recognition. "Yours sincerely, Brian Jones for Rolling Stones." EDITH GROVE, THE STONES FIRST FLAT Mick and Keith moved into the flat that Brian had. And Brian and Keith slept in a double bed in the front room and Mick slept in a very single, single bed in the middle room. And then there was a kitchen, which was a disaster. And it was a very severe winter that year, '62, and we used to give him shillings to put in the bloody meter for the one little electric fire. Brian used to say, "What's the point of getting out of bed "when it's so fucking cold? We might as well stay in bed!" So they used to get the guitars and stay in bed and play guitar in bed. VOICE OF KEITH RICHARDS Luckily, we had nothing else to do. And since we were down to thieving potatoes out of supermarkets anyway and selling beer bottles back to the off-licence, there was nothing else to do except push on, you know, and just... I mean, it had to get better, even if it didn't get fantastic. You know, it was difficult. But I mean, it was fun too, since we were determined that we were going to stick together and play. Despite everything, Brian was always tried to keep his parents' approval. "Dear Mum and Dad, many thanks for your letters "and a thousand apologies for not writing back before now. "Being leader and spokesman for the Stones means I'm always busy and tied up. "If it's possible, I would like to see you next Monday or Tuesday. "But I warn you, my hair is pretty long, although not untidy." "Success seems to be on its way, "though none of us are too happy about 'Come On'." "COME ON" Composition: Chuck Berry THE ROLLING STONES' FIRST SINGL # Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted # All day long I'm walking cos I couldn't get my car started # Laid off from my job and... "This record does not do justice to the group." Brian would invite his mother and father to the Stones concerts. But they never came. And Brian taught Keith to play with him. You know, all the linking notes. "BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY" Composition: Jimmy Reed There they go. See, one's going up and the other one's coming down. When one's coming down, he's going up. BILL WYMAN ROLING STONES BASSIST And it's so beautiful. It's so perfect what they're doing. We did a song called Mona, which is a Bo Diddley song. And you got... You'll have to excuse me, that's my bloody... It's switched itself off now, thank goodness. He learned to play along with the tremolo. You know, the - doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. And in time. And so you'll hear it on Mona here. "MONA" Composition: Bo Diddley # Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. See? No-one was doing that then. # Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. But, he was a fucker, you know. He would be really horrible sometimes. He had one side of him, which I have to say was really, I wouldn't say evil, but he was really cruel sometimes. There's photos of us being photographed and Brian's over the top of me dropping cigarette ash on my head. But he used to do things like that. And not only to me, but to everybody. He always had to prove himself. He was embarrassed about his size. And if he didn't get his way, he kind of used to get very aggressive and then he'd be all apologetic and, "Sorry, man, I didn't mean it." He'd stubbed that cigarette out on the back of your hand in the car... and you'd always forgive him because he was such a nice, sweet guy. Brian had immense opposition from his father. His dad didn't like him trying to be a musician. They just thought, get a proper job. You know, the same old thing. Up to a certain point, LEWIS JONES Brian was a perfectly normal, BRIAN'S FATHER conventional boy, LEWIS JONES JET ENGINEER who was well behaved and was well liked. Liked, I suppose, because he was well behaved. He did his studies and he was quite a model schoolboy. And then there came this peculiar change in his early teens, at the time, I suppose, he began to become a man, where he began to get some resentment of authority. It was a rebellion against parental authority and it was certainly a rebellion against the school authority. He often used to say, why should he do something he was told just because the person who was telling him was older? From being an A grade student, Brian rebelled. BRIAN JONES He failed in his studies, and put all his energy into music CHELTENHAM GRAMMARY SCHOOL and picking up girls. VOICE OF ROGER LIMB He played occasionally clarinet in the school orchestra, BRIAN'S SCHOOLMATE but Brian was not really interested in anything else at the school. Not in athletics. Not in any sports. Not in the cadet force, not in debating societies or anything like that. He kept himself to himself quite a bit at school, I would say. In the beginning of the '60s, it was one society, just this mono culture, and it was our generation who went beyond that. VOICE OF BARRY MILES BRIAN'S FRIEND It's a level of sort of middle class tightness, which you don't possibly see so much any more. He had a pretty bad relationship with his parents, who were very respectable, very straight, very posh. But he used to say he just couldn't stand it. The problem with Brian was that he came from a very, very bourgeois family... who saw themselves as better than the neighbours and better than this and better than that. BRIAN'S MOTHER WAS A PIANO TEACHER Brian's parents, his mother, was a Welsh Baptist. VOICE OF PAT ANDREWS The mother was very rigit. GIRLFRIEND 1961 - 1962 MOTHER TO BRIAN'S SON MARK There was no fun, no laughter. I'm sure his mother loved him. But I just think that... she didn't know how. VOICE OF LEWIS JONES All the time, his fanaticism for jazz music was coming to the fore. It was a great disappointment to us and a source of considerable anxiety when he became so wrapped up in his love of jazz music, that in spite of everything we could do or say... he went off and did it. # Wop-bop-a-loo-mop alop-bom-bom FILBY'S JAZZ CLUB # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti BRIAN AGED 16 WORKED THE DOOR # Tutti frutti, woo # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti # Awop-bop-a-loo-mop alop-bom-bom... According to Brian, his parents VOICE OF GRAHAM RIDE they didn't like him playing jazz. BRIAN'S FRIEND They thought it was, you know a degraded form of music. The fact that things were becoming more rebellious. We favored Black music. We favored the underdog. # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti BRIAN MET HIS FIRST GIRLFRIEND # Tutti frutti, woo VALERIE CORBETT, AT THE CLUB # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti # Tutti frutti, oh Rutti... Frustrated by his parents' disapproval, Brian adopted Val's family VAL CORBETT and spent all his time playing blues music. GIRLFRIEND, MOTHER BRIAN'S FIRST CHILD Val Corbett, yes, I knew her very well. BRIAN AND VALERIE BOTH AGE 16 VOICE OF ROGER LIMB She was rather stylish BRIAN'S SCHOOLMATE and I thought she was rather nice. Brian was quite besotted with her and she, of course, was besotted with him. Anyway, they were obviously made for each other. The next thing we heard was that Val was pregnant and she at first was terribly pleased because she and Brian were going to leave Cheltenham, go and live in London and get a place together. And suddenly it dawned on her that wasn't going to happen. VOICE OF GRAHAM RIDE He did offer to marry her. BRIAN'S FRIEND He did offer to marry her. But her parents, her mother in particular, wouldn't allow it to happen. We know, those days... the parents ruled the roost, didn't they? They sent you iff to a nursing home somewhere. VAL AND BRIAN'S CHILD WAS GIVEN UP FOR ADOPTION BRIAN'S HOUSE On December the 22nd, 1960, Brian, aged 17, was kicked out of his home. His father would later refer to this as "my most drastic of all actions, "which I shall never forget or cease to worry over." VOICE OF PAT ANDREWS And there was Brian's suitcase in the driveway. GIRLFRIEND 1961 - 1962 It was really sad night. He had asked me to help him to get his clothes and stuff out. But lucky I got, as I said - My sister at that particular time had a spare room. He had a grear time at my sister's. Brian, now rejected by his parents, PAT ANDREWS, AGE 20 moved in with Pat and her sister, Betty, WITH BRIAN'S SON JULIAN MARK and was looked after by their parents. This became a pattern of Brian's behaviour - adopting other families, getting the daughters pregnant and then leaving. This would happen at least five times. Do you feel bitter at all? I'm not actually bitter. I feel quite sorry for Brian in a way, because the kind of person he is, you can never be happy, could never have true friends. The only friends he has probably like him because of what he is. I think if he was turned out on to the streets, nobody would want to know Brian. He's not the kind of person that you take to because he's so cynical. He's got no feelings for anybody. He just uses people for his own good. And when he's finished, he throws them aside. So I just feel sorry for him. Brian's own life mirrored the rebellious spirit of the Stones more than any other member. Expelled from two schools. Thrown out of his home. A reckless personal life. The blues was Brian's salvation. It was probably his flaws... VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA that were driving him AUTHOR "SYMPATTHY FOR THE DEVIL" to escape from Cheltenham, family life, wherever And then that music is going to be his vehiclw. The toughest Chicago music. Elmore James. Robert Johnson. Muddy Waters. MUDDY WATERS # Oh, a child's coming # He's going to be, going to be a rollin' stone "ROLLIN' STONE" INSPIRED BRIAN'S NAMING OF THE GROUP # He's going to be a rollin' stone... So that atonal, bluesy, harmonic structure if all the Stones, in fact that came from Brian. And then the edginess of the sound, that was Brian. # Well, I feel # Yes, I feel. It certainly is true that for loada and loads of American teenagers they didn't really kniw about the blues before the Stones. That was a really key moment in Brian's trajectory. Introducing that stuff to Americans. Tell us something about him, Brian. When we started playing together, we started playing because we wanted to play rhythm and blues. And Howlin' Wolf was one of our greatest idols. And it's a great pleasure to finally be booked on this show tonight... - Thanks to Howlin' Wolf. So I think it's about time you shut up and we had Howlin' Wolf onstage. I agree! Let's get him on. Howlin' Wolf! It was a huge deal for those guys because they'd just never really been on TV. To be there are peak time in America, that was an incredibly big deal. # How many more years # Have I got to let you dog me around? # How many more years # Have I got to let you dog me around? It's an incredible moment and there are still people who put it as one of the greatest TV moments of the 1960s. There's a great period in the first couple of years where he seemed to have real insight. And I'm talking about 1961, 1962. # I'll try to show it if you're driving me back # Your love for me has got to be real # For you to know just how I feel # Love for real and not fade away... So you worked out both the keys of open tunings of blues, which is D slash E, which is open D or E, which is Elmore James, and he was open G, which is Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. # I'm going to tell you how it's going to be # You're going to give your love to me # Love to last more than one day... So what did we do for the 5th single? We wanted to do a blues and everybody said, "Don't do it because you'll destroy your career. "No-one's ever done a blues record for a single in England." You know, it's the worst thing. Like they said to Ray Charles, "Don't do a country album because it will destroy you." And it was the greatest thing he ever did. Well, when we did Little Red Rooster... they said, you know, "You're going to kill yourself." It came out on the Friday and on the Monday it was number 1. And Brian... controlled the whole band. I'll start again. That's Brian with a slide. "LITTLE RED ROOSTER" Composition: Willie Dixon See, he's doing it. # I am the little red rooster... What is anybody else doing? # Too lazy to crow for day See, he's making the song. # Everybody wants somebody # Everybody needs somebody # To love... So we were completely unique. # Someone to kiss # Oh, yeah # Sometimes a miss # Someone to please # And sometimes a squeeze # I need you, you, you # I need you, you, you # I need you... Bo Diddley couldn't believe how good we were. # You, you, you # Sometimes I feel like # I get a little sad inside # When my baby mistreats me # I kind of get a little bit mad # I need you... Rolling Stones! Rolling Stones! Rolling Stones! We were in a bloody tornado all the time. The band in 1963 played over 300 gigs. When you'd come on stage, the whole crowd would just pour forward. # Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away # I'm going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day # Climb into my machine so we can groove on out # I know some swinging little joint where we can jump and shout # It's not too far back... There was rioting whenever the Stones played. It was an outpouring of emotion against the authorities and the traditional ways of doing things. # A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am... The way the Stones looked and dressed, their hair and sexuality, was a whole new feeling. Everyone fancied both Brian and Mick, both male and female. They had this extraordinary androgynous quality. # I'm going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day... Brian met Linda Lawrence in 1962 and was adopted into her family. I only saw him. VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE Yeah, and heard him. GIRLFRIEND 1962 - 1964, MOTHER OF BRIAN'S SON JULIAN The sound was what I was connecting to and it was the harmonica and the slide guitar. The first time I'd ever heard that kind of music or felt that kind of feeling, it was just... just amazing. Yeah, a whole feeling came over me that I'd never felt before. # My days are pretty rough # I want you to come back, come back, come back... LINDA AND BRIAN IN 1963 It was instant. BRIAN 21, LINDA 17 Like, if you can call it love. At the time, I wouldn't have known what that was, but now I do. There was a point that came where he said, "Can I come stay with you in Windsor with your parents?" And I said, "Yeah." Yeah, my parents loved him. # Somebody stop this pain in my heart # My, my, my, my, my, my # Don't you know, one day # My days are pretty rough # Won't you love me? # Love me. Most of the time it was all about music VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE and what records he's going to get. And how he was going to play this and, you know... And I would often put the records on over and over again so that he could get the riffs and things. Put it back on and have a listen and get the sound. AUSTRALIAN TOUR Seeing them get more and more popular and more and more people coming to see them... it was very exciting. And we got very, very much in love. How do you feel, when you ger all these girls screaming and shouting? - It's great. VOICE OF BRIAN JONES Girls screamibg at a concert and not somebody else. You feel a personal pride. When we toched down in Sydney, we had a riot at the airport. There were about 10.000 kids there. And they just went mad, and they wrecked the airport building. Brian! Brian! He was loved by so many people. I didn't mind that. VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE I knew he loved me, so I didn't care. And I knew we were young. I just knew he loved me. And I... I felt like it's Ok. You know, he'll be back. We were excited, because we didn't think, raelly we didn't know much about Australia. How big we were, or how small we were. I was knocked out. I mean, the girls, lisren to that, they're wild. You know, we're knocked out, we really are. Are you used to this kind of reception, then? Yeah, we're used to it, but we're not... you know, we weren't expecting it in Australia because we didn't think we were very well-known. Well, apparently, you're rather well-known First of all, let's go with somw of the numbers. How did all this start? Uh, well, we just met each other in jazz clubs in London, 3 years ago. Brian's rivalry with Mick for leadership of the Stones was growing. Mick was the natural frontman and Brian's insecurity played into this. A visible friction grew up between them. It began to dominate Brian's thinking. You know, we're not traying to create anything, you know We're just acting like we always have done. How would you describe the type of music you play? Many people have tried to describe it, how do you describe it yourself? Well, I suppose it's rhythm and blues, if you want to call in anything, you know Rhythm and blues or blues. VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE Brian sent me to a modelling course LINDA MODELING IN 1963 for a little while in London and I had taken the hairdressing course. So I was really into hair and I was saying, "Just grow your hair, don't cut it", you know. And then when it did get quite long, I would trim it, but not cut it, and make that shape. He was like a gentleman. He was all dressed in his white shirt and his jacket and he was open doors. It was that kind of... very gentlemanly and gentle spoken. He had a family, obviously. And after a while, we drove down. He wanted me to meet his parents. And I know he didn't take many people down to meet his parents, so I knew it was something special. Did you feel that Brian cared a lot what his parents thought? Oh, very much. That was the whole thing, that he really did want them to like what he was doing and, you know, be proud of him. That was the whole point, I think, of us going there. They wanted him to have a different career. Something more like what his father had been doing - a good paying job. But Brian kind of saw that and he kind of rebelled and stepped out of it. # I warned you baby from time to time # You don't listen so pay me no mind # About moving on # Yeah, I'm moving on... We became the love generation and the music was going to be the opening. # Mister Engineer with your throttle in hand # Take me back to that Southern land # It's called moving # Keep a rolling on # You're flying too high # For my old sky I'll move on. VOICE OF MELISSA NORTH We were just coming out of this 1950s thing. ARTIST AND ASSISTANT TI JIMI HENDRIX You know? We were excited about everything. The bands came to London, and the girls came for the bands and then they were getting away from their parents. Everything their parents said they should do they wanted to do the opposite Quite right, too. They'd all use to hang out at the... what is called? The cafe on Denmark Street where all the musicians went. Just standing around waiting for Brian Jones, you know, whoever. It was awful, these probation offixers. I'm not saying, one probation officer, there had ro be flocks of them. I had to kind od deal with them. They' say, "Her parents are very worried and she..." "Her parents say she left in a pink miniskirt," and "have you seen her?" But i wasn't going to tell the probation officers and tell their parents, because you know, they wanted a different life. Dawn Molloy was the mother of Brian's 5th child. DAWN MOLLOY I was 18. GIRLFRIEND 1964, MOTHER OF BRIAN'S SON JOHN I don't think I'd ever been in love before. Every time I saw him, my heart skipped a beat. And every time we saw me, he... It was obvious that he wanted me. Being a Catholic, I was very... inhibited. He kind of got that out of me. Not to be ashamed of my body and what I could do. He was very, very sexy. Yeah, the way he made love, he just was insatiable. WHEN DAWN WAS 18, BRIAN WAS 22 He made me feel... ..amazing. He just made me feel... ..loved and special. He was an amazing teacher of how you should make love to a woman. My parents, they had such a thing against... long-haired pop stars. "Oh, this music's no good." You know how it is. They didn't want any of it. I never dreamed he'd come to our apartment. There he was, on the doorstep. "Good evening, Mrs Malloy." And kissed her hand. I mean, who does that? It's just... He had suave. They liked him in the end. Then my mum said, "Well, why don't you go down to your bedroom? "Show Brian your bedroom." # I'm going to tell you how it's going to be... And then he turned around and asked my parents if he could take me on tour. There's no way my dad is going to let me go. But my dad said, "Well, you know, as long as you're in a different room "and you take care of her, it's Ok." The security wasn't around, so you could just walk into a hotel and the girls were everywhere. We went to our room and there's this girl there and she's just sitting on the bed stark naked. And then we went into the bathroom and there's another one. And they're willing to give everything to them. The police had no idea what hit them. They were completely taken by surprise. And it was terrifying. I could see all their feet, trampling on people in stiletto heels, going for his arms and stuff. I thought I was going to die. It was like being in a tube train and you can't move. I think Mick lost some hair. They pulled... Literally pulled hair out of his head. And I started to fall back and I fell back and Mick caught me. Brian was looking for me, so he came around the corner and saw me in the arms of Mick. And then... ..Brian lost it. "Keep your hands off my fucking girl! You're not having all my girlfriends!" And all that kind of stuff. Mick said, "Hey, I'm just holding her, you know. She just fell. "Don't be a dick", you know? And then Bill said, "Yeah, sometimes you get like that. "You just have to leave him, he'll be fine." Everybody went through their... VOICE OF KEITH RICHARDS star trip, you know. And I think Brian was the only one that it changed in a really deep way, and probably not for the better. It was very difficult for him, you know, and not made any easier probably by the rest of us, you know, because nobody had the time to look after somebody else. If one of them isn't quite strong enough to deal with that situation there's very little you can do to help him. They were all a little wary, I think, of Brian VOICE OF DAWN MOLLOY because he could be kind of moody. But I think they put that on him because he was supposed to be the leader and he was no longer the leader. Mick ruled the roost as far as what they were going to play and the fact that he could write music and Brian couldn't. I think there may have been a little jealousy there. The fact that Mick and Keith were so close. # Yeah, yeah, yeah # I feel all right # I feel all right, children... ANDREW LOOG OLDHAM MANAGER I think they were a little bit lost until Andrew came along. And then Andrew kind of laid down the law and said what he wanted to do, which was all very well. And I thought that was a good idea to have a manager, but I don't think Brian realised that he would be handing everything over to him. "LITLLE RED ROOSTER" BRIAN JONES PLAY SLIDE GUITAR They had two different ideas of what they wanted to do. Brian loved Howlin' Wolf and he wanted to stay as a blues group. Andrew wanted them to be pop. And I think Andrew and Brian just didn't hit it off. And I think they just got into loggerheads. Pop sold. And obviously Andrew wanted to make money. Thank you. "Dear Melinda, "Mick is the head of the group. "At one time I was, but Mick took over. "Don't ask me why. We just thought it would be better, "as he is a good leader. "Mick's birthday was on the 26th of July. "I must rush, dear, honestly. "Brian Jones." I guess he was a little jealous of Mick because he was... VOICE OF DAWN MOLLOY He had all the fame sort of thing. But I don't think Brian realised that he had just as much too. # Oh, Carol # Don't let him steal your heart away # I'm gonna learn to dance # If it takes me all night and day # Climb into my machine so we can groove on out... I think he would've liked to have been like Mick, VOICE OF DAWN MOLLOY but then no-one's like Mick. He has this charisma about him, he has amazing energy. # A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am... I understand, Brian, because I think he was a lost person. The success of the Stones was unbelievable. But at a time when Brian could have celebrated the success of the band he had founded, he was locked in conflict with problems of his own creation. The reason I found out about Linda was because I was told VOICE OF DAWN MOLLOY to go to Torquay. And then Stu told me, no, I couldn't go in and see him because Linda was there with the baby. I'm like, "What... whose baby?", you know? He said, "Well, Brian's." # Well, you know my lovin' not fade away... VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE Fame is a very strange thing. WITH BRIAN'S SON JULIAN And he wanted that as well. And so that was the choice he had to make. And... and he did. VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE I was at all the gigs. The other girlfriends weren't allowed to come, but I would always be at the gig. The last one that I was at before I had Julian was the Bo Diddley concert. # Hey, Bo Diddley - Hey, Bo Diddley # Hey, Bo Diddley - Hey, Bo Diddley # Hey, Bo Diddley - Hey, Bo Diddley # Hey, Bo Diddley - Hey, Bo Diddley # I got a girl lived on a hill - Hey, Bo Diddley... VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE I bonded so well with Bo Diddley and it was all fantastic. They thought that Brian and I were getting married. I thought we were getting married. LINDA AND BO DIDDLEY So it was a bit of a shock when Andrew Oldham came in and said, "You can't have girlfriends and wives and, you know, it's..." Because I knew that he loved me and it was really hard to understand. And I kept saying to myself, "Well, I have to let go "and he'll be back." And my dad, when he left, said, "And there's no-one to look after him now." Brian tormented himself because he couldn't write songs like Mick and Keith, whose compositions had moved the band on to a whole new level. Say hi to Brian. Brian is one of the writers of most of the things, right? No, I'm not, actually... Well, I'm not really a writer. Ah, we do write a lot of stuff together - it comes out under the Nanker Phelge pseudonym - but Mick and Keith write more... many - Thank you, Bill. They're a little more industrious than we are. In writing the songs that you write, do you sometimes think that you have a special inspiration for the way that you... Well, you'd better ask - about writing songs - better address those questions to Mick and Keith because they'll tell me more about it. But the ones we've written together are just things we've worked out together in the studio, with somebody, you know, anyone had right idea. If you had to do it all over again, do you think you'd go the same route again? As far as, you know, now that you realise the demands that are put on you as a tremendous success? I'd do it 100 times over, if I could. I love it. Good. Thank you so much. Let me swing over here and talk to Keith and to Mick. These are the two that are supposed to be all the writing talent. You fellows get together and do most of the writing, right? Yeah, that's right. A lot of it. You know, some of it. Do you have a particular inspiration for some of your songs that seem to springboard them out? Well, I don't know. Ask Keith. I don't really think so, no. It just happens, you know? It just happens. VOICE OF MICHAEL LINDSAY HOGG Mick and Keith are wonderful songwriters. CREATOR OF READY STEDY GO I mean, they're just great. Extraordinary. I mean, I couldn't admire them more. They tended to write more about sex. So from '64, '84... Like, for 20 years they were just turning them out. I mean, they're classic rock and roll songs. I'd rate it as extraordinary. VOICE OF BILL WYMAN You see, the trouble was by 1963, when Mick and Keith were writing the songs and all that, Andrew was trying to promote Keith and kind of dismiss Brian, get Brian out of the way. And so what he did was he stopped me, Charlie and Brian from doing any interviews with any of the newspapers, any interviews at all, and gave them all to Mick and Keith. And I think when we talked on the phone ages ago, you mentioned that he did something with Jimi Hendrix. Yes. - Some play. - Yeah. No-one knows that. What do I say? BRIAN AND JIM PLAYING BRIAN AND JIMI OFTEN PLAYED TOGETHER And I got Brian trying to write a song with that guy, Michael Aldred, of Ready Steady Go! But they're unique things that I just happened to get, and... they shouldn't be... - Was the song good? Yeah, they were putting a song together. It was OK, yeah. But he never had the courage to record it. BRIAN RECORDING WITH MICHAEL ALDRED Oh, fucking hell, turn it off! # So far away # like an angel # drifting through the halls of stars unknown # I know all her likes and dislikes, her story of succes No. It's difficult... - Oh, let's get... Bleurgh! He never played me a song he'd written, so it was quite hard to know VOICE OF MICK JAGGER really if he wanted to do songs with us that he'd written. I think he did, but he was very shy and all that, I think he found it rather hard to lay it down to us, you know, that "This was a song and "it went like this." And we probably sort of didn't even think - because he didn't do it, we didn't try and bring it out of him, probably, which was... I suppose a bit insensitive of us. ZOUZOU GIRLFRIEND 1965 I arrived to New Year's Eve it was awful because his girlfriend, Linda Lawrence, was still there. And that's how it started. Yeah. I think we we look good together, yeah. And I think he always tried to have girls who look a bit like him. You know. I had my hair cut like him, you know. He didn't like himself, and at the same time he wanted to have people who looked like himself. Which is quite strange, again. He was playing guitar at home, but he was not really composing, because I think he was not sure of himself. He wasn't sure that it was right He wasn't sure that what he was doing was good. And jet he had nobody around to tell him to do it. I thought it was really funny I never listened to obe album of the Rolling Stones in Brian's place. Never. You know, Brian was completely fan of the Beatles. I mean, all day long we were listenig the Beatles. Or the Righteous Brothers. But, never, never, never The Rolling Stones. BRIAN PLAYED ON THE BEATLES' "YOU KNOW MY NAME" Composition: John Lennon / Paul McCaetney Brian was really nervous that night, 'cause he's walking in on Beatles session. And I kinda though he'd bring a guitar, you know VOICE OF PAUL MCCARTNEY But no, he brought his saxophone. He wad nervous to the point of ahaking a little bit. He was like a topey sax player. So I go, "Aha! We've got just the tune." He was very nice. Brian was a very nice guy. I remember sort of laughing a lot with him, you know, giggling a lot. VOICE OF ZOUZOU The only person of the group who came to visit him was Bill. I never, never, never see Mick or Keith coming to visit him. Never, never, never. VOICE OF BARRY MILES Each member of the band had a had a court. And the way the hierarchy worked was the Stones would always have to go to the Beatles' places. So the Beatles would never go to their house. You know, that was the order of things, a very strict class system at work. in his big chauffeur-driven car where we had a loudspeaker mounted underneatg the car, And aheas of us was Brian's Austin Princess. John got on the mic, "Pull over now, you're under arrest." "Brian Jones, pull ocer, now!" "Oh my god!! Shitting gimself, you know. - "Oh, holy shit." And we'rw going, "Ohhh, fuck off! Brian was a very nice guy, he was very nervous. Had always a sort of pleasent word. He was doing so many stupid things all the time. And I was also taking the same shut with him, you know. Speed. And we didn't sleep for days and says and says and once a week we were sleeping one night and then again and again and again, clubs and everything, you know. You know, all night long, all day long. He was also having breakdowns very often, he was craying at night, he was... I mean, yeah. He was really... He was, uh... he wonted to have, uh, his, uh... things, you know, here. To.... He wanted to go to a clinic to be... yeah, and I was... - Trayed to have a facelift? - Yeah. I was telling Brian, "You're only 24 years old, yoz're not going to start now", you know. "It's ridiculous, you shoud just drink a little bir less." Because he was drinking from the morning to the last minute in the night. He was drinking scotch Coke. Scotch Coke all day, all night. All the time, you know. He was never drunk, because with the speed, you know, didn't make him drunk. Bur he was really doing every stupid thing you can imagine. I think he was not so happy. I think he was sort of sad, and I think also that when he was crying at night and that all those things were only symptoms. He was worried of so many people looking at him. You know, Brian was much more happy when he was alone. I think he liked drinking and I think he liked drugs but they weren't very good for him. VOICE OF CHARLIE WATTS I don't think they're good for anyone, but he didn't... He wasn't strong enough, mentally or physically, to take any of it. And of course he did everything... Brian was one of those people that did everything to excess. VOICE OF BILL WYMAN We were in Clearwater, Florida. Me and Brian picked up these two girls in the coctail ba. Cute, two cute girls. We went to bed with them. Strange as it was, the very same night Keith wrote the basics of "Satisfaction" he says, in Clearwater, Florida. You know, at nighttime he woke up with that with the idea of "Satisfaction". Can't get no - da, da, da, Satisfaction And when he woke up in the morning, and listened to it and all that him and Mick thought it was a pretty okey song for an album. And then it became this classic fucking track, you know. They're going da-da, da-da-daaa and I'm going dun-dun dee-deedle-eeee-dee So Brian just played the walking rhythm behind him. And it kinda worked. And remember, no matter what anyone says... rock on. # I can't get no satisfaction # I can't get no satisfaction... Whenever he put "Satisfaction" VOICE OF ZOUZOU he was going mad. Mad man. He was telling that Mick and Keith writing shit and he couldn't stand the music they were doing. He said, "It's not the music I wanted to do". "I made a group to do some blues and rock & roll". And, you know, he said "Look at this, it's vulgar, it's awful, it's out of tune, it's nothing." The trouble with Brian was VOICE OF BILL WYMAN he wasn't very well a lot of the time. So he was often ill. We'd be on tour and Brian would get sick, and he'd be in hospital for five days and we had to play without him. Just the four of us, you know. Bass, drum, guitar. And you're playing all them songs that need more than one guitar, and you've only got one guitar. So I had to double-up on bass, the bass playing, and help Keith out, you know, and Keith had to play a bit more than he would normally play, playing partly rhythm, partly lead. It was tough, you know. So he was very unreliable at times in the later period of his life. You know, the last... maybe three years. Brian used to get very paranoid about being made fun of. You know, he always said, "They're talking about me and they're..." You know, when we were waiting in a... When we were staying over in a hotel or something. Mick and Keith would always tease him It was like any group of guys. RONNI SCHNEIDER, US TOUR MANAGER The classic example that I had of that was at the hotel in New York when Dylan was coming to visit him. You know, he was very friendly with Dylan. So Mick and Keith - Brian's room was next to mine, so Mick and Keith came into my room. They said, "Oh...", and they were very devilish. And Keith goes over and grabs a water glass that I had, and he puts it against the wall so he could listen in to Brian's room. And Mick goes over to the house telephone, my phone in the room, and calls Brian's room. And then immediately he says, "Hello, Mr Jones. "You have Mr Zimmerman for Mr Jones." And he was imitating putting Dylan on the phone. And then when he was on the phone, he says, "Oh, Brian, I think "you're the best guy in the group," that kind of... And Brian's like, "Shut up, you guys! I know you're..." And that was the kind of stuff that was going on. MARIANNE FAITHFULL MICK'S GIRLFRIEND # Show me the train... Already there had been shit going on. VOICE OF MARIANNE FAITHFULL You know, Brian was in very bad shape. He couldn't get into the States. And they didn't know what to do, and this and that and the other, you know, of just scrambling all the way along. It wasn't as bad as it was going to get later. TALKING WITH HER BIOGRAPHER DAVID DALTON Well, I read an interesting thing Keith said about this, that they started making fun of Brian so as not to get mad at him. Ah! - Because it was a way... But I mean, of course, for somebody who's paranoid, this is just about the worst thing you can do. But I mean that was Mick and Keith's, apparently, attitude to this thing, you know? Well, because, you know, I mean if anybody had really let their feelings go, they would've kill him. - Mm-hm. And you would kill them too. I mean, it was that bad. VOICE OF DAVID DALTON I think Marianne sympathised with Brian. MARIANNE FAITHFULL'S BIOGRAPHER And Marianne of course was not in much better shape because of drugs. She knew him very well and had, you know, had an affair with him. Marianne felt that she had become a real drag on Mick. And there's a horrible conversation where she overhears Ahmet Ertegun AHMET ERTEGUN saying to Mick, "You've got to get rid of Marianne, PRESIDENT ATLANTIC RECORDS THE STONES' LABEL "you know, if the band is going to function. "It's having a really negative effect." And so in that sense I think she absolutely identified with Brian. ANITA PALLENBERG GIRLFRIEND 1965 - 1967 Anita Pallenberg was a massive influence on Brian. She was credited with transforming both Brian and the Stones. I was with Brian the first time when he met Anita VOICE OF ZOUZOU She was traying to grab Brian, you know Brian was holding my hand, we were sitting on the couch two of us, and she was traying to grab him, you know and turning down the light and everything, and starting to almost take clothes off, you know I knew she would take him through the sex adventure. I knew Brian waa on a bad, bad, bad trip, you know. And she was really powerful with him, you know. She was the one who would decide everything. But she had... she was the man in the relation, you know. She was an incredibly interesting person, who'd done a lot, VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA and was on the make, in the way that he was. And she craved new experiences, you know, in the way that he was. But I think he was thinking of leaving the band. I think he probably could have and probably should have left the band for his own, you know, health and sanity. But I think, by teaming up with Anita, he knew they'd be a real phenomenon, which they were. And that really launched his kind of last great... last great ride. Oui, oui, je le comprends. There was such sort of... erotic power to their pairing and such glamour. And also, you know, he wants to be glamorous. He wanted to be seen as a main player in the Stones, and she'd helped that happen. BRIAN AND ANITA BOTH 24 you know, like a little unit, whispering, talking to each other, giggling, speaking in sort of a code that, you know, VOICE OF GERED MANKOWITZ intimate couples can have sometimes. ROLLING STONE'S PHOTOGRAPHER And I think they were doing a lot of acid and just hanging out. She was staggeringly beautiful, had extraordinary physical and sexual confidence. You know, when she walked in a room, you know, guys' eyes popped out and tongues rolled out, like in a cartoon. Succes and fame, I don't think it is very important. I mean, in England I was always with the Rolling Stones. And more fame and succes than that, I mean, nobody could dream about. So, I don't really aim for succes. I just try to have a good time. Make a bit of money. VOICE OF DAVID DALTON The Rolling Stones, they were, MARIANNE FAITHFULL'S BIOGRAPHER as Marianne would put it, were a bunch of yobs. They were very talented, but they weren't educated or sophisticated. Marianne and Anita connected them with all the European intellectuals ROBERT FRASER GALLERY OPENING and film-makers. VOICE OF MARIANNE FAITHFULL We were the right women for that time to enable whatever had to happen to happen. And probably the same is true of Brian and Anita and Keith and Anita. They seemed to be a proto-aristocracy. MICK AND PRINCESS MARGARET Mick at one point said, "Well, the only thing left is me and the Queen." LUGALLA ESTATE, IRELAND Brian and Anita would spend time at the vast Guinness estate in Ireland. This is Mick go-karting at Leslie Castle, a massive Irish estate that has been in the Leslie family for 1.000 years. A whole new world opened up to them. I think it was the great changing of the old order, wasn't it? LADY JANE ORMSBY GORE I loved the sort of mixture, the juxtaposition then of the Stones and the Beatles INSPIRATION FOR "LADY JANE" (JAGGER / RICHARDS) and the royals and the thing, you know? It suddenly was all... Everybody and anybody were part, part of the same thing. It was excellent. It was my sister Victoria's birthday, and that was a sort of wonderful melting pot with the Kennedys and Princess Margaret and the Beatles and the Stones and then all my relations. Brian definitely came. Brian was the most sort of sociable at that time. He was much the most sort of gregarious. So it was it was the informality, I think, of it that was part of the whole thing of the '60s. Never mind who was there, whether it was rock stars or royalty or scrubbers from... the East End. It really didn't make any difference. Brian's best friend at the time was Tara Browne. TARA BROWNE He was the Guinness heir and owner of Dandie Fashions FRIEND OF BRIAN'S on the King's Road. The so-called Swinging London was actually a very small group of people, and Brian and Tara were right at the centre. Tara was immortalised in the Beatles song A Day in the Life when he had a tragic car accident. "A DAY IN THE LIFE" Composition: John Lennon / Paul McCartney # He blew his mind out in a car # He didn't notice that the lights had changed # A crowd of people stood and stared... Brian was devastated by Tara's death, the first of that intimate circle. Brian would later date his girlfriend, Suki Poitier, who was with Tara in the accident but miraculously survived. And we all wore the Dandie Fashions look, which was so much the spirit of the time. BRIAN'S FLAT AT COURTFIELD ROAD VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA Anita was pushing him to dress more outrageously. He was the archetypal dandy, more than anyone, you know, in '66, '67. At that point you can see the power dynamics shift within the band, where Keith is coming back to Brian again. So for a period, yeah, he was back with Keith, because he was cool and happening, and obviously at that time they did Ruby Tuesday. VOICE OF BILL WYMAN He was doing all that stuff without asking anyone. He'd pick up a flute or just anything that was handy and just create something out of it which wasn't there originally. And it embellished the song so much that it became the catch. "RUBY TUESDAY" Composition: Mick Jagger / Keith Richards # Or in the darkest night # No-one knows... # Do, doo! Can you hear him? # She comes and goes... # Do, do, do... # Goodbye, Ruby... He just finds a flute, and he finds a little thing he can play on it. Brian's self-loathing came out in the way he treated other people. VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA He and Anita particularly were known for spiking people's drinks. Anita would encourage him for that kind of outrageous behaviour. They would just mock people who hadn't... Who weren't turned on in the same way that they were. So that was a thing - "We're the hip kids - we can make fun "of other people." LINDA LAWRENCE For instance, WITH BRIAN'S SON, JULIAN Linda Lawrence came. I think she was short of money for young Julian. I think they were up in the flat, Brian and Anita, and they just laughed at her and wouldn't let her come in. I felt devastated. VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE They looked out the window at me and they just didn't came down and open the door. That was a horrible feeling that I wasn't being let in. VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA Did you, I mean you... because up 'till now you've been very sympathetic towards him. There must have been a point where you just said, "You bastard". I was very depressed, but I never thought he was a bastard. So, way do you think he acted like that, then? What was the explanation? As far as I'm concerned that was Anita's influence. That's as simple as I can say it, because that's what they had. Brian, when I was with him, didn't have any of those... ways of thinking. When he started hanging out with her, his dark side came out. Which would only be natural, because I know what that is. VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA So whilst he could still make things happen in the studio, he still was holding some power even whilst he was this kind of liability at the same time. You know, he was pretty dominant in terms of the sounds. You know, they needed to get a bit more exotic. Paint It Black, he's embellished it again. "PAINT IT, BLACK" Bass pedals. Composition: Mick Jagger / Keith Richards There's Brian. # I see a line of cars and they're all painted black... ERIC BURDON THE ANIMALS Your head goes into, like... You're suddenly in the Middle East or Far East... That made me realise that there was a very inventive guy there. ERIC BURDON AND BRIAN I mean, he was really a... bit of a genius. DEGREE OF MURDER - 1967 FILM MUSIC COMPOSED BY BRIAN Are you sure about that? (?) The Volker Schlondorff film "Mord und Totschlag" was a big deal VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA for Anita and for Brian. It was a starring role for Anita, with a really good director, and it was really pretty like their own - Brian and Anita's - relationship, where there was this constant provocation and escalation of provocation. Hau ab jetzt. With Anita, Brian found a partner, a match up to his level. VOLKER SCHL?NDORFF So, I guess they got a lot of I mean, it certainly was never tender relationship. Even though, I mean I was not in the bedroom. But sometimes you couldn't help overhearing or whatever. The rwo of them were in this frenzy. They were crazed out. Which also always start with the way they behave in hotels, and I mean why the hell would you, you know, whatever they did... turn down curtains when they felt they needed more daylight. Or spill red wine or whatnot all over stuff. It's... It was beyond me to understand such bahaviors. Anita, you are 22 years old, where are you from? I'm German by blood, but Italian forever. And Anita was also kind of putting oil on the flames. If there were people who were scandalized by their behavior she'd shout back at them, "You're all backward bourgeois, this is the new lifestyle." "Get lost." "Go home and die." He was the one who asked to do the music for the film. Couple of months later, when I came to London to actually do the recording I found out that he didn't prepared anything. He was not in his proper mind anymore Anita said it was because of the drugs he was taking. He was experimenting with anytihing. So, yeah, ultimately something come together, but it's not... it's nothing memorable. 1967 CANNES FILM FESTIVAL I think the drugs destroyed his already failing discipline. And you can't be an artist without discipline. He probably knew that this could only lead ultimately to self-destruction. Ultimately, when she was not able to control him any longer, to the next Stone. Wasn't very far. Actually, in the Cannes hotel it was from one room to the othwr. And, uh, I... that's what happened because one morning I came into Keith's room and he had breakfast on his bed and, uh, and Anita was next to him now. She arrived with Brian, and couple of days later left with Keith. So, it's, a... an envious position to be in for a woman. Of course, Anita didn't have a credit card of her own or a checkbook. I think she always had to go to Brian to get a bundle of money. Because she lived the lifestyle of the Stones. And I think she got hooked on that lifestyle so she did not just leave Brian and walk off and work as a secretary but she swirched over to another one who was just as rich. VOICE OF KEITH RICHARDS Back in London there's this sort of tearful scene and Anita said no, you're just too much of an arsehole to live with. Keith and I got something goin'. But that kind of was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian, you kniw. He'd never forgive me for that, and I don't blame him. BRIAN AND LINDA KEITH When Keith went with Anita, Brian decided to start going out with Linda Keith, who used to be Keith's girlfriend. KEITH AND LINDA KEITH All their relationships were always slightly incestuous. Marianne, you know, when she gave up with Mick, she went with Brian... and then she went with Keith. So she went with three of them. Anita went with Brian, she went with Mick, she went with Keith. It was all very mixed up, you know? Girls would end up being with another member of the band. Seeing the state of Brian, his parents finally reached out to help him. VOICE OF LEWIS JONES What I firmly believe BRIAN'S FA4HER was the turning point in Brian's life... was when he lost the only girl he ever really loved. When his mother and I saw him for the first time for some months after this happening, we were quite shocked by the changes of his appearance, and in our opinion he was never the same boy again. He changed suddenly and alarmingly from a bright, enthusiastic young man to a quiet and morose and inward-looking young man. Brian and Linda Keith's relationship was tempestuous and drug-fuelled, with Brian recovering from Anita and Linda from Keith. Linda ended up taking an overdose in Brian's flat, which she survived. Brian wrote this to her... "Dearest darling Linda, I'm presently very smashed. "Please be with me. "I'm so lonely by myself. "I need you so badly and I love you so much. "Please understand what fucked us up before, "a terrible combination of events. "Please let's start again. "Please marry me. Please, please, please. "All my love, Brian." VOICE OF KEITH RICHARDS It was a painful year, you know? '67 was a year of change for everybody. I mean, '67 was the explosion of the drug culture. DRUGS and POP STARS Facts that will SHOCK you 1967 VOICE OF PAUL TRYNKA The whole infamous Stones drug bust MPs ASK: WHY HANDCUFFS? all followed in the wake of News Of The World stories that prided themselves in actually busting Mick Jagger and proclaiming him a drug user. The problem was it wasn't Mick. It was Brian. He was hanging in a nightclub called Blazing and boasting about being a druggy hipster. He actually told the reporter he didn't do LSD much these days now that everybody had taken it up and, you know, he was doing it before anybody else. MICK AND MARIANNE AT MICK'S COURT APPEARENCE For Mick, Brian was the villain of the piece. VOICE OF MARIANE FAITHFULL The only person who was really, really out of it on drugs was Brian. This was like the last straw, the straw that broke the camel's back with Brian. And I think it brought up a lot of bad feelings that were already there about Brian. Mick didn't know he'd end up in prison. It was just dreadful. But it was very frightening, because you saw the sort of the power of the state, the power of the status quo, the whole thing coming down on them - for nothing. Mick was very, very, very desperate and just in... It was a horrible thing. I don't think he ever thought this sort of thing would ever happen to him in his life. And I must say, to my shame, I wasn't very compassionate at all. If you need to cry, you cry. It was a real moment of truth and vulnerability. Needless to say, he never, ever showed it again. VOIS OF PRINCE STASH KLOSSOWSKI DE ROLA Brian and I were vusted. They thought that if they could get Mick and Keith then if they could get Brian that would be the end of the band. PRINCE STASH AND BRIAN He was teribbly worried that his folks would think of him. Because he'd been a bad boy throughout his teenage years and now he was this successful musician and suddenly there was this disgrace. You know, it was mortifying to be dragged into this thing. He was very worried about what his parents might think. He went behind the scenes to contact his parents. He said, "Please don't think badly about me, and so far go. I was at Robert Fraser's Mount St apartment and he knocked like a ping-pong ball, everything as he crossed the room. You know, he sort of bounced. He was in horrid state. He came to see me at Paul McCartney's, Way he was in a horrid state, and he was convinced Mick and Keith were picking on him and so on and so fort. 1968 THE ROLING STONES ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS The phone rings and it's Brian. VOICE OF MICHAEL LINDSAY HOGG And he said, DIRECTOR THE ROLLING STONES ROCK AND ROL CIRCUS "I'm not going... I'm not going to come tomorrow." And I said... I said, "Huh? Why?" And he said, "Because they are so mean to me." And I said, "Who's so mean?" He said, "Mick and Keith, they are making my life hell." Naively, I said, "Well, what would the Rolling Stones be without you?" And anyway, I'm thinking, MICHAEL LINDSAY HOGG "What the fuck do we do with four "Rolling Stones if we really are looking at five Rolling Stones?" And so then he stopped, he listened and he stopped crying, and he said, "It's just been a hard day." And also, you don't know how much he's... I think he was drinking a lot. I convinced him to come the next day. There was something kind of childlike about him, because then he had dressed kind of like a wizard. Then when they got onstage at two in the morning, he was... I would say he was drunk because he looked it, and he could play the maracas and he could play the slide... he could hardly play the guitar in the regular way. He looked dreadful, really. His big bags under his eyes. I mean, really, bags under his eyes for a guy of 26. BRIAN'S LAST APPEARANCE WITH THE ROLLING STONES He was just gone. Well, he wouldn't turn up half the time. When he did turn up, he was not in any condition to do anything, had to baby him. And it was very sad. VOICE OF MARIANNE FAITHFULL I saw him as another person with incredibly low self-esteem who needed help not to be destroyed and ground underfoot. And that's when I kind of realised what was going on and how it was going to affect me. That kind of ruthlessness, you know, the bit where they would pretend to be recording Brian and not have him plugged in, that was really terrible. VOICE OF DAVID DALTON Both Marianne and Brian, they were victims of the Stones. She realised she was no longer useful... JUNE 9, 1969 and he was especially horrified BRIAN KICKED OUT OF THE STONES to be ostracised from his band. There was no serious way that we could consider going on the road with Brian. VOICE OF KEITH RICHARDS So Mick and I had to go down and sort of tell Brian virtualy like, "Hey you cock, you're fired." The fact that he was expecting it made it kind of easier, I guess. You know, he wasn't surprised. I don't really even think he took it al in, he was already... up in the stratosphere. VOICE OF DAVID DALTON A rock group is sort of like a, you know, a primitive tribe. People are often killed in tribes, psychically, if they're expelled. And a rock group is sort of like that. I mean, their whole lifeblood comes from that bond. Once they're of no use, that is... oddly fatal. Like, nobody wants to talk to them or deal with them. They just go off into the woods and die. VOICE OF PENELOPE TREE I felt like he was very much the underdog. He was lost and, you know, I just felt for him. I felt that he had been... badly treated. I remember he had a dog. She was a spaniel. Such a sweet dog. She was maybe about 5 years old, and she looked about 20 because she'd eaten a cake with acid and she'd gone on a trip that had lasted sort of months and months. You know, sad things that happen. JULY 3, 1969 Charlie phoned me up, COTCHFORD FARM BRIAN'S HOME phone went about three in the morning VOICE OF BILL WYMAN and he just said, "Brian died." I couldn't believe it, you know? It was such a blow that, you know, you just don't accept it for weeks. You can't really believe it's true. And I mean, I don't... I don't think we slept after that, we just laid and talked and... Just couldn't understand it. I think he'd been doing what he always used to do, and that was taken downers and doing heavy alcohol, and fell asleep in the pool. It was basically that simple. VOICE OF CHARLIE WATTS He got much nicer to... Just before he died, you know, the last few years of his life, BRIAN DIED 3 WEEKS I felt even sorrier for him AFTER LEAVING THE BAND for what we did to him then. We took his one thing away, which was being in a band. VOICE OF KEITH RICHARDS It really knocked us back. I mean, been with that cat for seven or eight years nonstop, you know? To have him suddenly removed completely. Although it was a shock when it actually happened, nobody was really that surprised too. There are people... I'm sure that everybody's got those things about certain people everybody knows people that... you just have that feeling that they're not going to be... they're not going to be 70 years old ever, you know? Not everybody makes it. JULY 1969 HYDE PARK CONCERT FOR BRIAN JULY 1969 500.000 PEOPLE ATTEND I was just 20, and we were all incredibly shocked by Brian's death. It was the first drug-alcohol casualty of our generation. We felt his death marked the end of the '60s, and the concert in the park which we all went to was very much the end of the '60s and a sort of mass funeral for everything that had gone before. You just knew there was going to be a massive change, and Brian's death somehow was an emblem for that. VOICE OF VOLKER SCHL?NDORFF I flew to London immediately from Munich when I heard about it. I was there, and stayed with Anita and Keith in their house. We were talking and sitting and hugging. There was a mourning and sadness around all of them. It was a very emotional thing, the way they organised this farewell and goodbye, as if to say, "Now you're still - or again - one of us." And Mick was very upset. I just want to say something that was written by Shelley, and I think it goes with what happened to Brian. Peace, peace! He is not dead, he does not sleep. He has awakened from the dreams of life. Brian was so sensitive, really, VOICE OF MICK JAGGER because Brian was so sensitive to everything, you know what I mean? I suppose there was a kind of feeling that I knew that Brian would... If anyone was going to die, Brian was going to die. I mean, I always knew that Brian wouldn't really live that long. But he just... he lived his life very fast. He was... he was kind of like a butterfly. 40 years after Brian died, a box of old letters addressed to Brian were discovered in the attic of Linda Lawrence's family house. In it was this letter from Brian's father. "My dear Brian, VOICE OF LINDA LAWRENCE we have had unhappy times "and I have been a very poor and intolerant father in so many ways. "You grew up in such a different way from that "in which I expected you to. "I was quite out of my depth. "In my most drastic of all actions, "which I shall never forget or cease to worry over, "I felt it was the only way to save my home "and bring you to terms with yourself. "I don't suppose you will ever forgive me, but all I ask "is just a little of that affection I think you once had for me. "This is a very private and personal note. "Don't trouble to reply. "Love, Dad."
