You're not a rifleman, you're a radioman ! What about Tao-Tsay ? There's fighting since midnight We have to join Tao-Tsay ASAP They think it's the viet's great offensive ... No kidding ? We can't hang around ... They said the rescue column for Dien-Bien-Phu has retreated The B26 can help us They'll bomb the tracks as soon as the weather clears Thanks Perrin ... -You've lost a lot of blood - Huh ? Look ! Some morphin for you ... Give him some as well! I can't. He has a bullet into the lung. Morphin'll kill him 4 dead. 3 at Roudier's and one ... Surrender ! Or you'll die ! I surrender ! Now, we retreat ! Koot, Koot ! I'll go with the HQ group and Roudier's with the wounded men to hill 924 Bullshit ! Along the river ! You stay here with your group. 15 minutes. Do you have a watch ? 15 minutes and then you retreat drawing the viets with you. Then try to get to hill 924. We'll wait for you until midnight If there is trouble, i don't know ... Go directly to Tao-Tsay, ok ? It's impossible with the wounded! They have to stay here! Sir, if we carry Roudier, we're dead ! I'll take Roudier and the others ! Fucking bullshit !

Willsdorf is not German, he's Alsatian. Only 5 morphines left. Alsatian, yes, but during the war, he was German All France was occupied ! It wasn't the same thing. He speaks German, in fact. - It's ok, Roudier ? - Yes - Oh yes, he spoke about Russia ... - Huh ... A battle in Russia, a little Stalingrad ... - Willsdorf can't escape - Oh Perrin, and your radio ? Ok, ok ... I'll go ... Choose 3 men. The less tired ... To make 4 stretchers with bamboo The others will walk - Bloody British ! - What's wrong ? There is an interference from an English station, Singapore, maybe ... And what can we do ? Nothing except doing it again and again ... I said nobody ... Oh, it's you, Ti ... I think they are near us. In that little clearing ... But with the echoe, impossible to be sure - What's that ? - THe men cutting bamboo Koot's guys ! The first one is Willsdorf It's Kantum - The last one ? - No. Him. There are 6 of them But, he's insane, Willsdorf ! Go on, Chan ! Perrin, stop with the radio.

It's a green one. The worst kind. I wonder what they eat when we are in camp. Sir, want syringe, sir Tell the lieutenant, quick The lieutenant is coming with morphine don't worry : this evening we'll be in Tao-Tsay And tomorrow a plane will come for us. We are lucky ...

Missed ! Me know his wife. Me tell her him dead Dig a grave along the track Was he your friend ? He was scared. Me too. I'm going to die I'm thirsty Fa-Long was a good soldier. We'll never forget him. That's all. We leave in 5 minutes. There is a village ! Stretchers on the floor ! We stay here Ti. Inform the chief of the village What are you saying ? The viets came here once ? Leave with elephants quick. Leave quick ! What are you mumbling ? Tell me if the viets came here once ? Yes Sir, yes And they are going to come back ? Yes.

Opium, good. Japanese smoke and better after. Do you want to smoke ? I'm fed up with pain ... Did you get Kra-Tsie ?

Sir, give me some tea ... You mustn't drink, Roudier ... Just to moisten the mouth ... What the fuck ? I'm going to die ... We can't always win ... If I'd known it was so painful I'd never have drunk the river water In Marseille, when I came on the boat ... There was a lot of cops because of the riots In Marseille ... And also in Saigon ... I often thought about that ... And now it's time I'll never know. I just want to sleep a bit. Friday May 7th 6 PM Roudier is dead Sir, Roudier is dead Right! Everybody up ! Perrin, Ti, everybody up ! Sir, civilians, elephants, gone. All gone ! And the sentries ? Sentries ? Don't know ! Don't know, don't know ? He was sleeping ! Him says not sleeping. 2 comrades go with civilians What's this mess ! It's incredible ! Ok. BAR teams : go to each entance of the village. Ti, get the wounded men ready to go. Roudier died last night Perrin, take 2 men - dig a grave The man who lose his weapon in the river ... He takes one of the abandoned rifles and all the ammo. He destroys the other rifle Get up ! Get up ! Dear sir : we scared. Vietminh everywhere, not good. Like with japanese, we go mountain, we hide I'm very sorry Signature : Li-Ten-Su If you need rice, you take Assholes ! Willsdorf ! - Glad to see you - Me too - Sir, the watch - No, keep it - Any problems ? - It was tough Two viet companies stuck to us. Some casulaties. At 11 PM, we escaped. Koot sent 2 guys hill 924 You didn't wait ? Great idea ! The viets were there. One of the guys was killed Yesterday, in a village, people told us you came here. So, we followed you. Shit ! There are no civilians here ? Yes, they ran out with our elephants Not a good new ... Roudier is dead. We bury him then we go. - Hey Willsdorf ! Fine ? - Fine ... Good ... Another wounded man ... Sir, He can't walk ... Sir, It's a miracle you're here. Tao-Tsay maybe doesn't hold out any more - No, on the radio, they said ... - You contacted them ? Tao-Tsay ? No. But the news on Radio-France Asia ... Listen : Nay-Mi is dying. Soy is dying, too. You're the boss. but I'd give them up without hesitation - You're right ... but ... - You want to carry them ! I'm a pro at war. Plus two tours of Indochina ... Ok ... before this evening we'll be naked ... Get up ! Koot : in the lead ! Ti, stay with me ! Perrin, you deaf ? - But .. I am ... for Roudier ... - Give up ! Shit ! Don't be upset : viets would dig him up to know who he was Go, now ... You're right. You're always right. Thanks Willsdorf ... Ti, help me ! When viets will touch him, it will blow them out ! Willsdorf, what do you think about Roudier ? He was not much of a talker. A good guy. Why ? I'm here for 18 days. I thought i knew him, but ... I was surprised. He was very brave ... You're a weird guy, Willsdorf. I saw you in the clearing You got the BAR, but you'd give up Roudier Why do you think i got the BAR ? To preserve it from the viets ? I did'nt care ! A BAR with a good team is good stuff. What was the value of Roudier ? The speed of a snail. And he died nevertheless Keep the distance ! What a pretty valley ! In 2-3 weeks, all the trees will be red The Cambodians'll celebrate the red, they'll drink and dance with girls Sir : when you make war, you must be sure of one thing : the target must justify the casualties. If not, you can't win. Keep the fucking distance ! Sir, sir ! A village - no civilians. I sent a man to explore. - Viets ? - Meos ... Let's go ! Not good ! Civilians all gone everywhere ! Shut up Koot ! Civilians scared ! What's this mess ? Drop that ! Don't worry ! Koot told them they can take what they want So, you're ok with this looting? I'm going to explain : the civilians thought we were viets ... ... So they gone. They'll imagine the viets'll have done the looting ... You're very smart Willsdorf, very smart ... But we'll take nothing ! Ok, ok ... Koot, stop what you're doing ! I'm going to tell you a funny story In 1946, during my first tour in Indochina ... Look, sir ! What is it ? St Estephe 1950 ... - Where do you find it ? - There ! We can't drink this wine and oblige this guy to drop its pan ... It's quite disgusting ... But it's better than a kick in the ass ... So, in 1946, the company was in the Mekong delta ... The captain - killed in 1949 - decided to organize a big raid in the jungle He had a wooden leg. In the pubs, he always stuck forks in it. With the pants, it was so funny ... Well, well, well : let's go ! 5 meters between each man! Thanks ! In the villages, all civilians used to welcome us with little flags When we turned up at the first village, nobody. Same as here. The captain said : an empty village was a rebel one and had to be burned Finally, a rebel village ! We burned it. Immediatly the civilians came back howling. They were waiting for us at the other side of the village ! They even had their little flags ! Willsdorf, that's a cruel story ! Yes ... - A viet camp ... - There were many ! - When did they leave ? - Not long ago - What do you think about it, Willsdorf ? - Koot is right Have a cigarette ? Chan took mine Thanks ! Sir, me scared ! Don't want to be at the head ! Fucking coward ! Koot, come with me at the head ! What's this mess ? You're scared about the viet camp ? Give me your submachine gun and ammo ! I don't like to be half-naked I imagine a viet who says to his buddy : look, I'm going to shoot this guy. This one ? No, the naked one ! Silly, isn't it ? We have to cross here. Maybe with the 2 BARs to cover us. - Ok. Do you think ... - I don't know. I'm worried ! There are marks in the mud, over there. When we're on the other side, send 4 or 5 guys ... Keep the distance ! Keep the fucking distance ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! - Ti, take the BAR ! Stay here ! - Yes Sir ! Let's go ! Take cover ! Han, give me the BAR ! I know where they are ! They're about 10. With only 4 or 5 rifles. 2 viets killed. With your gunfight, they're scared, now ... Sir, sir, civilians very scared ! What are they saying, those civilians ? Over there, there is the Vietminh captain. Fights around Tao-Tsay. So, Tao Tsay still holds out ... Anything wrong ? Tell Ti to come here with the rest of the group ! Hooo ... My belly is so painfull ! Some tropical disease... Opium is a good medicine. - What do they say ? - Not much They were conscripted to carry rice for the viets Viets told them Dien-Bien-Phu has surrended. Tao-Tsay too. But they heard some shots during the night Don't drink like that ! Tao-Tsay, is it still far ? 2 hours on the track. But we can't use it. Excuse me ... Ti, follow them ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! You twat! And your radio, idiot ? Oooh shit ! I wanted to take a piss ... I took it, and ... It's nothing. But you really are an asshole ! Now, go ! Tao-Tsay ! I was quite sure ... Shit ! No more cigarettes ! You surprised me I didn't think we could reach Tao-Tsay Shit ! I've got smoke in my eye ! I knew it. I always knew it. Tao-Tsay has fallen. We continue towards Kra-Tsie. We made half of the trip. It'll be easier, now ... The dakota of Royal Air Cambodia. Perrin, the radio, the radio ! Yes sir. I'm going to try to contact them on 5400 KC ... I don't care how ... The pilot is Delpierre. A civilian. He dropped the mail at Liong-Ba - Perrin ? - 2 minutes. Chan, Go on ! What is his flight code ? Dakota, Lima Bravo speaking ... Answer, Dakota ! Answer ! Lima Bravo. Dakota speaking ... Lima Bravo. Dakota speaking ... Plug me. Dakota, Willsdorf speaking. Delpierre, do you hear me ? Willsdorf ? You're alive ? Everybody thought you're dead ! Great ! Ask him for a drop! Drop us ammo, food and meds ! Over ! Ok, Lima Bravo. Tell me where and when. ASAP ! I don't know where. Yes : where we hunted tiger last year. Yes I remember Perfect ! Tomorrow, around 5 PM. I'll drop what you want Ok ! Go to Pelgrin's and drink an iced cognac ! The tiger ? French soldiers of Lima Bravo ! Surrender ! This is the Army of the People of Viet Nam Stop the war now! Fucking viets ! This is very bad news 599 01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:35,687 Nobody on the crest ! Clean the weapons ! Koot, check the ammo ! Ti, look after the sick guys ! This is Radio-France Asia : Here is the news After a 57 days battle, Dien-Bien-Phu has surrendered Pilots of the supply planes say there was no firing after 6 PM. They saw long columns of men, probably French prisonners At this time, all over Indochina, Vietminh divisions are heading south Tomorrow, in Geneva, the conference about Indochina begins So, they've won ... Well ... It's a long way to our lines I don't think we can reach Kra-Tsie So, I think ... Willsdorf, a cigarette please ... So ... Tomorrow, we'll attack the viets in the village The village where they stock the rice ... You'd better smoke with a water-pipe, like me ... It's a little bit harsh to start with, but it's cool And about the attack ? You're the boss. I hear you. Tomorrow, we'll attack the village ! Don't be upset. I have a deal ... Fucking mosquitoes ! You're right. It's impossible to reach Kra-Tsie. We can only escape towards north-east We can join the Meo villages. They are organised for the guerilla warfare. That was our goal with Koot until we arrived at the village with the elephants That's the tiger means : telling Delpierre we go north-east What's the deal with this tiger ? Last year, Koot killed a tiger with his submachine gun We gave the skin to Delpierre, who sent it to his wife Because of the holes, she can't make a coat with this skin, So, she made a bikini ... Can you believe it ? A bikini ! Something for the colic ... Drink it. Be careful : it's hot. It's good for you. The Meo guerillas. Good idea. But we can attack the village before. Our guys are exhausted ! Exhausted ... Exhausted ... Sure, we're are running like rabbits ... Exhausted ... My foot ! Cowards in fact ! Listen, tomorrow, we'll leave the wounded men and we'll attack the village ! The charge of the light brigade ! And we'll be naked at the end ... What do you think, Koot ? Better run north-east ! I'd go with you, Sir ! Shut up ! If we're lucky, 10 of our guy will be dead. So what ? Do you want some of this disgusting tea ? Willsdorf ... The attack ... It'll be so cool ... Then we'll go hunting bikinis ... Woooh ... The weather is quite cool ... You look like a guy I met. He was injured. The arm, like Perrin. But, he was like you ... It was in Berlin. In May 1945. He also wanted to be an hero ... But I ran. He said : we'll be hung. All of us ! Viva la morte ! He said. And he laughed ... When I escaped, the viets .. No, the Russians - they used cannon to kill them If we survive, we'll go to this pub in Kra-Tsie ... What's its name ? Ah, yes ... The Bungalo, AKA Pelgrin's Yes, that's it. Pelgrin's ... A big big party at Pelgrin's ! We'll smoke big cigars ... Willsdorf ... What ? Do you think they will conquer Hanoi now ? If they want ... There's nothing between Dien-Bien-Phu and Hanoi - And all Indochina ? - I don't think so How do you cope with loosing wars ? But you know that. You were in the Wermacht ... - By conviction ? - I was conscripted ! Alsace was a German territory, annexed ! Ok, I was in the German army ... It was a piece of shit ... And fuck ! Smolensk, Voronej, Kursk, Kharkov ... fucking awful! Saturday May 8th 09h15 AM We go, now ? The charge of the light brigade. There are 8 viets. But some may be hidden. What is this guy doing ? Talking about their victory ? I think he's a political officer - OK ... Listen ... - No. You listen .. Look at the last house, over there. The peasant told me it's the rice store. I'll go there and block the main exit. You watch this house. The 2nd sentry may be hanging around the house. When I'm in position.. crack ! I believe you want to hunt tiger right now ! Perrin ! Give me that. I was a good sniper at Coet ... Go !!! The sentry, the sentry ! Take it and stay here ! Follow me ! Watch out for the civilians ! Watch out the viets ! Ti, bring me everybody here ! Koot, go and burn the rice store ! Stop that ! Stop it now ! Looting is strictly forbidden ! Ok ? The party is over ! 3 men with Koot ! You others destroy those rifles. This woman is dying. I told them to give her opium. I took a bit for you. Sir, he was trying to escape. Me kill him ? No, he'll carry the wounded. Victory ... How many viets dead ? 9 here. With the 2 sentries. And I don't know how many in the house 3. So, 12. 3 are missing. No, 2 with the prisoner ... Sir, house burned ! Run out now ! But what was this guy doing ? I know, sir ! He say : Cambodian, yellow. Not good with French white men. Good with yellow Vietminhs He say : French ran out at Dien-Bien-Phu He say : white run out. Yellow stay. That's all That's all ? So, translate what I'm going to say to these laughing boys Blood is red. And red will stay here. Always ! Dig graves ! In the village ! Nice show ! But a little bit simple, the egg trick, no ? Don't believe it ! In 1946, the rebels didn't dare shoot the white "gods". Because they thought the bullets would come back to them. You know, in Cambodia ... Perrin ! Come here ! Look at these ... All the way from London - British cigarettes ... So ... In Cambodia, they like fairy tales signs of fate... Symbols ... They are poets ... You are a poet, too. A tragic one ... Koot, let's go !
