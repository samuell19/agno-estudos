Why are we doing this now? It's on our way. It saves us a trip. So we might as well drop it off now. But tomorrow you'd have more time. Never mind. Unbelievable. Everyone's got a spare fridge... when an appeal like that goes out. They should have planned it better. Do you want to take it back home? No. Perhaps he can sell it. Please hurry. Yeah. What's up? Fareed has to go to hospital. Who? The refugee. I'll drop him off. What, now? It's an emergency. He has to see his wife. What about the Erzingers? I'll join later. I won't be long. Do you mind walking? Analyzing now. Stand clear. Tell him to park somewhere else. They're private parking spaces. They don't belong to the council. Alright. Okay. Bye. So, I'm all yours. Sorry. What exactly was your question? She has to be buried right away. What does that mean? That's how they do it. Within 24 hours, facing Mecca. Most send the corpse back home. Did you speak to him about that? He wants to bury her here. Because of the children. That's a matter for the council. Or the vicar, or who else? It's the weekend. Amrikon Council. Künzli speaking. Yes. One moment. Tell him we'll see to it on Monday. Hello. Is your dad there? Daddy. Please sit. Hello. Thank you. They make. They make? Good. Sweet. Does it work? The fridge? Yes. Great. It works. Listen Fareed... 24 hours is impossible. You know they have to talk on Monday. The council. It is very complicated. Understand. But Mecca... important. Hello. Roli, is that you? Yes. There's food in the oven. You can heat it up. It's still warm. I've packed your case. Did you buy suntan lotion? I didn't have time. I'll buy it on Monday. I have to go to bed. This tastes great. Sorry, I'm late. I have to see what needs to be done. Things need to be organised. Then I have to phone Künzli. Are we cancelling our holiday? No way. It's all booked. I just don't want you... to take on another burden. Good night. Where exactly is that? In Saudi-Arabia. I mean, in which direction. South East. Round about here. A bit further. A bit more. More. That was a nice sermon. How's it going? Fine, but my wife's been in hospital. She's back home now. Are you coming to the pub? No, not today. I have to go next door. Good. I can see a solution. We could place her diagonally. Then she'd have more space. What's going on? Thomas. Good that you've come. We want to check... if we can place her facing Mecca. She'd have to go at an angle. Or we can move that grave over. Who are you? Huber & Partner, Geotechnics: Keller. Have you gone mad? We're not rearranging the damn... cemetery just for one person. Does it really matter... if one grave is diagonal? Special status for a Muslim refugee in non-confessional cemetery? All funded by the tax-payer? The council has to approve. Take it all down! What a jerk! The map... What about those family graves? She could easily fit diagonally. That's not so easy. It's more expensive. Let's not talk about money. This is a humanitarian responsibility. I don't agree. We are setting a precedent. That's absurd. These are the only refugees around. If there's one buried here, others will follow. Berne! Did you ask there? They've got Muslim burial grounds. They only take their own. The council has to tend to it. I imagine... the family will tend to their own grave. They've only got a 'permit N'. They could still be deported. Then the plot wouldn't be theirs. This is about children! Bettina, don't get sentimental. It's a democratic decision. Let's vote. Roli, you should leave. We'll let you know. Let's not make a big thing of this. That's what I think. Hello. You look tired. Say something. I heard you're helping this family. Well, helping...you know. Did the wife die? Yeah, she got ill in 2011. She had cancer. I couldn't do it. Bonus card? I just get on with it. 17.50 SFr. It's just a different culture. They sometimes don't get what we mean. We just mean it in a European way. Thank you. I have good news. I've got good news. Amrikon council can offer your wife... a family grave. Amrikon is giving you a family grave. Now she can be buried facing Mecca. She will face Mecca. Thank you with all my heart. Thank you! It's okay. I thank you and all who have helped you. I will pass it on. Alright. A family grave for 25 years. He said: A family grave for 25 years. What does 25 years mean? She'll be exhumed in 25 years. What's he talking about? They'll dig her up in 25 years? That is not permitted in our religion. Yes, I know. You have to tell him. How can I face my wife? How can I face Allah? Once she has been buried... only Allah can raise her. No. They can't dig her up. Translate it for him! What's the matter? Well, it's... a Muslim grave is forever. Otherwise they can't enter paradise. Sorry! Excuse me. I'll just talk to Mr. Künzli. We are back on Monday at 8am. Damn. Thomas! Roli? Listen: A Muslim grave is eternal. Exhuming is taboo. Roli, that's our limit. We can't do more than that. But then she can't enter paradise. Then she'll have to go back home. But he wants her nearby. That's understandable. A human can understand that. Damn... and be grateful. I don't understand. It's his decision. Izra? Izra! I can't sleep. Where's Mama? She's with Allah. Can we fly there? When's she coming back? She's still with us. I can't see her. Go to sleep. Roli, are you awake? Yes. Don't you want to pick up? You are sure? Yes, okay. See you tomorrow. After all that... he's going to fly her back. Roli. I cancelled our flights. Thank you. Mr. Najjar. You have family at home? Yes, in Daraa. Okay listen... because of the poltical situation and the embargo... there are no flights to Syria at the moment. But we can send her to Beirut and then from there... your family can take her by car. It's no problem, it works. When? One moment. These are the flights. So it has, only two flights a week. First possibility, tomorrow afternoon... direct flight from Zurich. If it's not fully booked. What? They only take 3-4 coffins per flight. It depends on the aircraft. We'd take the first one. Okay. Here's the price. I just need his signature. Fareed, you need to sign here. Thank you. Is it a money problem? It's because they'll be so far apart. Okay. Thomas! Wait! He's decided. - And? He'll fly her home. It will cost 6700 Sfr. Roli, the council can't pay that. Hasn't he got any money? You've seen his files. What are you thinking? It's ideal. Transfer the whole problem... and be done with it. I mean it, Thomas. Only you can make it work. Okay. Ready? Yes. Financial exploitation... is not allowed in Islam. It's a tip. Have a drink on me. I don't drink. Thank you. You like it? Yes. Thank you. I'm no longer needed here. I'll be off. I'll never forget this. Neither will I. I'm grateful to you. Thank you. You're welcome, habibi. Fareed. What if you have to go back? I mean if you and your daughters must leave Switzerland? At least she can stay. She can stay in paradise.
