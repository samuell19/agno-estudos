Okay. That's good. Okay. All right, you're doing great. End him in two punches! Nice. Attaboy! Don't stop. Do you hear me? You're looking good. Don't stop now. Use your legs. And watch your left. Finish him off in this round! Can't you at least pose and shout, "I won!"? Do I really need to do that? I mean, it's not necessary. Shit. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned. Maybe something like this instead? - I'm... - A real boxer's pose, you know? Okay, fine. You can do whatever you want. It's true that you're on a winning streak. There's also a generation gap between both of us. But look, without the drive, you will eventually lose. Got it. You fool. Why do you even step inside the ring? Fuck it. Hey. I guess the Chinese took him out. It seemed so. Don't let that be you. Why would I? That decapitated Filipino was a drug dealer, right? Weren't you guys supplying him? Hey, drugs are illegal in our group. The smell of war is in the air. Why? A cop's intuition. Isn't your boss getting out soon? Well, give him my best. Boss! Congratulations on your release. Please take this time to relax. I booked an appointment at a spa. I will visit the old man's grave first. We will return to our territory immediately after. Yes, sir. I am pleased to meet you. I'm Kaneko from the Boxing World magazine. Our magazine has a popular column featuring unknown but promising boxers. It's called "Tomorrow's Champions," and we would like to feature you. Unknown but promising boxers... Right. Your boxing sense shines. It's promising. So first of all, perhaps you can tell me why you took up boxing. From what I have heard, you don't know your parents. Why did you take up boxing? There's no particular reason. That's all I can do. That's all. Okay. Yakuza with no sense of honor are scum. I didn't expect a Japanese, and a Yakuza at that, would abide by the rules of Confucianism. I was surprised! I was so in love with Ken Takakura. Hey, it was just a movie. Now that I'm here to see the Yakuza with my own eyes, I must say they're such a disappointment. They don't uphold humanity. They are not worthy of calling themselves men. Everyone is already struggling to survive in this world. We can't afford the time to show humanity to other people. Hey! Go shell the century eggs. Is he Japanese? Yes. He's a boxer. I'm sure even a boxer can peel an egg. - All right. Do it! - Round two! Leo, it's working! Go! Go! - You can do this! - Go, come on! Ry um! Ryuji! Open up! Come on, Ryuji. Open the door! Ryuji, let me out. Ry um! Ryuji! Open up! Ryuji, open the door! Noisy whore. Pipe down. I'm sorry! I will never do it again. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. I... I... The stuff... Are you going to increase your debt again? You still haven't repaid what your fucking old man owes! I'm sorry. You don't earn enough by selling your body. It doesn't matter to us though. Do you want some? Yasu, Monica wants a hit. What a pain. I'll give her some later. Later, he said. Thank God someone is staying here tonight. What? When the group is using this place, I have to bring Monica home when customers don't hire her. She's such an addict. She'd kick a fuss and scream, "Ryuji!" Isn't she fucking psychotic? Hey, go to the store. I'm hungry. What? Let's go together. Here, stand up. It's cold. I'm cold too. Now get up! - We're going together! - That hurts! Okay, I got it! I will go! I want glass noodles. Whatever you like. - It's raining like crazy. - What do you want to eat? - Anything will do. - Just tell me! Why? What has gotten into you? Well... This is nothing important, but... Tell me. So what are you plotting? To lay it out straight, you sell confiscated drugs on the black market, right? What? Are you trying to make fun of me? Are you all right? I'm talking about a profitable plan. How does that sound? I don't need that. A large shipment is coming in. Can you handle it? I have no idea what you're talking about. Let's split the shipment, how about that? Math? You can't sell it all at once. Sell it bit by bit. My grandpa often told me... "Slow and steady wins the race"? Yes, that! I haven't heard that in a while. Yes, I don't hear that saying much. It's a dead phrase. The old must make way for the new. Just like us Yakuza. Aren't we getting sentimental? You're following in the footsteps of the Mafia. Up-to-date Yakuza grow globally, but you guys are lost from infighting. What's more, your group has problems with the Chinese who don't care about honor. It's worse than a dead end. With this timing... Acting Chairman. This time we will punish the Chinese. That's the spirit. I can't do that with this body of mine, unfortunately. I leave it all in your capable hands. Be sure not to dishonor the old man. But you know, Gondo. It is the wish of the higher-ups to co-exist and prosper with the other groups. It's because of the era we're in. Don't be too quick to lose your cool. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Joshima. Yes, sir? Do you know where one-armed Wang is? He hasn't returned to Shinjuku yet. However, he will certainly return soon. Of course. He won't lay low now that I have returned. I will cut off his head this time. What era is this anyway? In the first place, the war started because Wang Do, the boss of the Chinese gang, had his arm cutoff. So do you want to run off with the drugs? I'm not going to run. I won't be on the run my whole life. I have a plan. So after I give you the drugs, I will fight with a civilian and get into trouble. Well, I have a bad drinking habit anyway. Then I will go sit in jail for two or three years. By the time I'm out, those annoying bastards would have already killed each other. Can you trust me? Well, I can only rely on a public servant for a job like this. You're quite the guy. If you're in, contact me using this. Let me hear more about it. You're Leo Katsuragi, right? Yes. Well, it's this spot right here. From the MRI image, we're dealing with a large tumor. What? A tumor at the base of your skull. It's a strain on the stem. The nerves around it will make surgery difficult. Is this why I collapsed? It's a strong possibility. There's no way I can accept this. I'm pretty sure that was just a lucky punch. It wasn't even a hard punch. It just happened to land in the worst place. I just can't accept it. What if we don't operate? I don't know how long you will have left to live. What about boxing? It will be impossible for you. In my group's case, we always change the place where we bag our goods. This time it's at one of our underling's place, where he imprisons a troubled girl. - Do you know Yasu? - Yasu? Oh, the guy who moved up from the street gangs? Yes, that's him. First, Yasu, alone, brings the drugs to the locked room. So if the cops aren't around and the place looks safe, he will call some underlings to help bag the stuff. We will grab the bags while he waits We will grab the bags while he waits for the underlings to show up. What about the imprisoned girl? Her scumbag of a dad got indebted to the Yakuza. His daughter works to pay off his debt. They let her sell herself out on a dating site for now. She goes by the name of Monica. So we will make up a story about how she stole the drugs and ran off. Spend the night with her and stay out of Shinjuku. I booked her for the night the drugs will come in. I heard that she's amazing in bed and will do whatever you ask. Anyway, keep her somewhere during that night where no one will find her. Once I get my hands on the goods, I will put them in a public locker. And at the right time, I will bring them to you. Then we trade the girl for the drugs. Well, you can kill her if you want. That saves me the trouble too. I'm not into that. That's my forte. I will clean things up nice and pretty. Will it just be the two of us? No, there's one more. One more? A woman will take Monica to the rendezvous spot. That would be Yasu's girl. She's keeping tabs on Monica. We have to do something about her too since we want to make sure that Monica takes the fall. Who will do that? What the fuck is with you? Kase. Is it all okay if I don't kill her right away? Do what you like. One more thing. If you lock her up, use her phone to contact her boyfriend. A text message would be fine. Wait, can you type in Japanese? Don't worry. My grandpa is Japanese. We have exchanged texts. Send this message to a guy named Yasu, "I will make your girl suffer as you have made Monica suffer." Excuse me. I always set up here. How about a reading? By the way, what kind of phone do you use, Monica? That is not a girl's phone. Is that for work? Yes. - May I see it? - Yes. I mean, it's not like I doubt you. It's just that I will get into trouble if it's bugged. What is it? It's nothing. Spring, summer, fall, winter... PALM READING Well, let's see. It would be best if you were to fight for someone rather than for yourself. For someone? Yes. Are there not times when you use your strength to beat others? Well, I am a boxer. - What? - A boxer. Oh, I see. Okay. Then I guess it's okay. But you see, even in boxing, you will reach your limit sooner or later if you fight only for yourself. Maybe you can fight to buy a nice house for your folks. I don't have any. They abandoned me when I was born. - Excuse me. - Yes? Can you look into my health? Okay. Perfect. You're extremely healthy. You're young and physically fit from head to toe. Do you get paid to say this nonsense? What? Oh, nothing. I was born alone. I will die alone. I don't care about others. Well, you're still young. Your life is just beginning. It's over! Thanks. Here you go. Now what? What? What? What? Wait up! Help me! Monica! Ryuji. A police badge? No way. Excuse me. - Ryuji, this way! - What? - Hurry! - Wait. Hey! Who are you? Fucker! Oh, shit. Kase, what the hell? Hold it! Hey, calm down. Calm the fuck down! It was just a drill! That was obviously just a drill! Don't fuck around, you ass. Bastard. Are you okay? I saw someone hit you. Yes, I'm okay. - By the way, who are you? - What? I may look like a drunkard now, but I'm actually a nurse. You looked like someone in need. Anyway, I only had a glass of beer and a couple of lemon sours. Nursing is too much pressure. Do you know how much I make? I mean, I'll be 27 next year. I was only in my teens a while back. My badge. - What? - Where's my badge? Badge? Oh, that guy must have taken it just now. Who took it? The guy who hit you. - Who was that? - How would I know? - Where did he go? - What? And where's the girl? They went that way, hand in hand. What the hell is happening? Your phone. Your phone. Unlock it. Take your clothes off. Get naked. Take your clothes off. Get naked. Not your top. Just your bottom. Yasu. Your... JULIE: I WILL MAKE YOUR GIRL SUFFER AS YOU HAVE MADE MONICA SUFFER. Motherfucker! Who the fuck are you? I can't understand you. Don't spill your blood on my pants! I wouldn't be able to wear them anymore! Hey. Hey! Don't get out of this by dying! Yasu. Are you already home? Which is it? Are you not picking up because you're at work? What's happening? Shit. Where did they go? It wasn't the cop you were running away from. It was my father. He scares me. When I was little, my dad, he... Excuse me. So, who is this Ryuji? A high school classmate. He... hit my dad for me. Does he look like me? No. Then what? Were you hallucinating? The drugs. It might be a side effect. What now? I must go back to work. What? You're going back? I have debts. I was taken out on a loan, so I have to work. Wait. "Taken out on a loan"? Don't you mean you took a loan instead? My dad told them to take me. Where is your dad now? I haven't seen him since, so... I don't know if it's true, but... I heard that he disappeared. That's horrible. I can't believe it. For now, I think it's best if you don't go back to work. Then, what... should I do? You're asking me? Maybe I shouldn't. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Well then. Hey. If you sit there, the lecherous cop will pick you up again. Sorry, I'm late. The traffic was bad. Kase. Do you know what's up with Yasu? What? He hasn't contacted you? What about Joshima? Not yet. Is that Yasu? Answer it. - No, it's my... - A woman? Please excuse me. Hello? Fuck you! What's with that girl? And what are you up to? What are you... Don't act all dumb on me! I'm talking about that guy who took the girl and my badge. What? Did something happen to Monica? Do you have a death wish, you bastard? Hey, calm down. I already went to the locker and... I'm screwed! My badge got pinched! - Is there something wrong? - Nothing. Do you have something to say? No, it's nothing. It's nothing. I'm busy. I'll call you back. Here. Yasu! No! It's from Yasu! What did you say? Well, it's about time. What has he been doing? Hello, is this Mr. Ichikawa? Is this Julie? Put Yasu on the phone. - I can't. - What? He's dead. He was killed! He was killed? Where and by whom? In our apartment. I don't know who did it. But... But what? It's Monica. It seems that whore Monica has friends. One of them nabbed me, but I killed him and got away. I don't think they're Japanese. What? So it's those Chinese bastards! What about the drugs Yasu has? What? I don't know. I don't know about that! The Chinese took him out. We're on our way. Don't let anyone in. Calm down, Gondo! We'll contact HQ. Until then, stay put. - Acting Chairman. - What? We don't need HQ's approval over a fight that someone else started. Kase, Ichikawa. Come. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Joshima, put an eye on the Chinese. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Motherfuckers! Good day. You. Go ahead and secure the remaining drugs. Yes. Yes? What's up? Your group seems to be running about. Someone pinched the new shipment. Who did it? It seemed to be a captive girl and her friend. Friend? Yes. They suspect you guys. Well, it's a convenient way to start a fight. Suspect us and expect retaliation. We'll grab the drugs and fight to your heart's content. Has Mr. Wang come back? Yes, he returned yesterday. He's looking forward to seeing Gondo. I want information on that runaway girl. Her face, name, and possible whereabouts. Get me what you can. Understood. Jia Zhi Jia Zhi! Gather the boys. He drinks a lot. I was a bad kid, 30... he has been hitting me since I was little. After that... All the more reason why you shouldn't work for his debt. I know, but... Drugs are a death sentence. I don't know much about your past, but you have managed to survive until now. Think about your future. Your name is... Monica? That person seemed to call you that. It's my work name. Your real name? Yuri. Is there any place you want to go, Yuri? Is there something you want to do? I guess not. I'm sorry. Well, for now, how about visiting this Ryuji? What? At the very least, he is someone important to you, right? It's not here. I figured as much. Excuse me. What about this? Should we get the cops? Are you stupid? The last thing we need is Forensics. I guess you're right. What about Yasu? We have got to get rid of him. Call in the cleaners. Teru. Yes, sir. No. No. This happens when you fall for the wicked. Nothing will bring Yasu back. I'll get the ones responsible for this. I'll kill them myself! Go home and rest. Kase. Yes? - Take her home. - What? Yes, sir. Don't stop. Don't give up. I'm an idiot. It's ringing. Pick it up. What if it's Gondo? Well, it's a side business phone. Besides, I'm driving. It's dangerous. For god's sake, just pick it up! What if it's urgent? It will be my fault if anything happens. That's impossible. I got it. Hello. It is I. It has been a while. Get the phone of the guy imprisoning Monica. Monica's work phone has a GPS app installed. It can find brats and old codgers. He must have used it to keep tabs on her. With the phone, we will know where she is. See. I'll look into it and get back to you soon. All right. Thanks. You know what? It just occurred to me. Whenever you made that Monica work, was she always unsupervised? What do you mean? Like, you know. Maybe you made sure she couldn't run. Like using GPS so you know where she is. It's on Yasu's phone. - He used this! - What, you have it? That's right. He used this app to check on her. - Then hand it over to me. - No, I'm going to kill her! No way I'm handing this over to you! Fuck all of this! You and Yasu are real pains in the ass! What? What? Don't worry. You'll be in a better place by tomorrow morning. I'll bury you next to Yasu. What a racket. I can't sleep... Julie! She has a roommate? Who the fuck are you? Her mom? Her grandma? Robber Stuff it! No way. This can't be happening. Some shit has happened, but I got Yasu's phone. What do you mean? You wouldn't believe it anyway even if I told you. What's with that? Anyway, the phone is with me now. Where's Monica? I know where she is. I'll get the stuff, and then we'll meet somewhere. Got it. It's hot! So it was that fucker. That cocksucker did it! Her real name is Yuri Sakurai. Find her, but don't kill her. She will be mine. Are you seeing things again? Try not to stare at him. What? Is there something funny? Just what is it? It's scary but funny? Funny but scary? Man. Just what are you seeing anyway? I want to see it too. But I don't want to do drugs. What a bad boy, stealing and killing your pals. All right. Can we discuss this? No, we can't. The stuff is mine. You mean, you're planning to keep the stash for yourself? So what? Then there's room for discussion. There's no time to argue among ourselves. We have to go up against the Chinese. You will be killed for sure. But not me, so don't worry. Why are you so sure? Dumbass. I'm totally positive. - Are you a double-Grosser? - I wouldn't know. Are you going to turn them over to the Chinese? They're busy looking for Monica. Yo will betray them too? Now put the drugs in the car. I've got ten bags in here. I will keep four, you take six. How about that? Don't fuck with me. You should have discussed things with me when you had the chance. Fuck. How many does this make today? Was Joshima really... - No shit, in the parking lot. - Those fucking Chinese! Hey! Who else was there? - What are you... - Talk! Who else was there? As I said... - Hey! - Hey! What? What's happening? Who is this woman? Yasu's girl. What is it? It's Kase. He killed Yasu! Everything is his fault! - What? - What? He has got to be here. What's that? I put an app on Yasu's phone, and it says he's here. Only Kase can have it! - Bugging a lover's phone... - I'm going to kill him. I'm out to kill. Everybody, let's kill people! It's late. Let's call it off after all. Then where will you go? How about going home? To make sure your dad is really gone. Well, it's okay if you want to go back. We're getting close. Here? It's true. He's gone. Are you okay? Hey, it's Monica all right. They just came out. Come quickly. Monica. Drugs, please. Understand? If you don't give me the drugs, you will die. What's with this guy? I don't know him. How many more friends do you have? It seems like I'm having my first hallucination. Who are you? Where are the drugs? A real gun? - Where are they? - Here! Take cover! Motherfucker. Where's my badge? What? This... This, right? "This, right?" You asshole. What's going on? That's what I would like to ask. Who is he? Who are you? Is that guy dead? That can't be helped. We have got to wash somewhere. So, you're a real cop? Are you really a civilian? But it's true that you're not a punk. And why did you hit me anyway? She was running and shouting for help. Are you trying to be a knight in shining armor? No, I was just annoyed. Sorry about that. What? Now he's apologizing. Why did you run anyway? - The hallucinations. - What? Her drugs ran out and the hallucinations began. That's why you hit me? Do you know what you have done? What were you guys up to? Shut up! - Don't interrupt me! - It's none of your business! Look, I'm out for now. I got my badge and I have recovered the drugs. You three get out here. Don't fuck with me! The situation has changed, so help me out a little here! Aren't we splitting profits? Is this how you ask for help? I will kill you, baldy! Baldy? What the... What is it? Ichikawa? Boss? Hey, Kase! We have a friend of yours here! The cat is out of the bag now. Back up! Get out of here! Kase! Get out of here! Who was that? Yasu's girl! The one who turned this girl into a hooker? Fuck yes. 80 what? Give it here! Please let me have some. Just a little. Just a little. Please. - Yuri. - Please. Are you trying to break my neck? What a fucking waste! Keep your paws off my junk! Are you okay? Do I fucking look okay to you? Hey. Oh, sure you can. I'll give that to you instead. I'm getting hard! Stop! I don't want this anymore. Save me. Yuri. Hey, what the fuck is happening? He's rubbing it on himself! Kase! There are still things to do before I die. Why is all of this happening when I'm about to die? What? There have been reports of gunfire in the Fujiwara, Ushiku-3 area. Officers in the vicinity are to report to the scene. Roger. We're headed there now. Get down! This is fucking wild! Holy fuck! Take the wheel! All right. Hey, you fuckers! I have got nothing to do with this! You bastard! This is all your fault! Shit. Don't fuck with the Japanese police! What are you looking at, jackass? Motherfuckers! Don't fuck with me! This way. Monica. Come back to me. Headquarters, we're searching the area. We have got to keep moving until morning. What time is it? My phone's battery died. Excuse me. Yes? Why did you say you're "about to die"? There's a tumor in my head. But everyone is fated to die someday. Even so, you came to save me. "Even so," you say? Maybe that's why I saved you. It felt as if my limiter was released. I will die anyway. I can't believe I'm holding this thing. It will be dawn soon. TOKYO Answering machine? Message number one. The 14th, 5:28 pm. I'm sorry, but would this be Leo Katsuragi's phone? I'm the doctor in charge of your neurosurgical exams at Kita-Shinjuku Central Hospital. My name is Sakai, if you recall. I thank you for your recent visit. I am deeply sorry. It was something that should have never happened, but you see, regarding the MRI image shown to you during your examination, there was a mix-up. The patient before you also underwent imaging, and... How should I say this? I'm terribly sorry. The conclusion is that no tumors are located in your brain. Rest assured that your brain is healthy. I can't believe I told you you were going to die. I... To delete this message, press 3. To listen again, press 1. To listen to the next message, press the sharp button. Message number two. I'm extremely sorry, but the phone suddenly cut off. Well, the thing is, if possible, I think it would be best if we could meet and talk directly. Sorry about this, but could you please contact me after hearing this? I'm very sorry for the confusion. Then”. That knockdown was really just a lucky punch? Perfect. You're extremely healthy. What? So the fortune teller was right? Your life is just beginning. Message number three. I am sorry for contacting you again. I am Sakai from neurosurgery. As previously mentioned, the hospital is extremely sorry for the trouble we have caused, and we are extremely worried about you at the same time. We're concerned that you're gravely shocked, and perhaps... In any case, should you hear this, please contact me right away. I will be waiting for your call. Message number four. I'm truly sorry. This is Sakai from neurosurgery. Mr. Katsuragi! Are you all right? This is a mistake beyond comprehension. I'm so sorry! What is this place? It's our closing time now. Well, we... What is it? What? Century egg. You know him? I heard that he's a boxer. You have stuff like this? Are you from the Yakuza or a civilian? What are you saying? Civilian. Take him. What? Not the girl. Just you. Hey, she's a civilian. She doesn't have any drugs. Please go. Yuri. Thank you for everything. It might be tough for you, but please live a long life. No, The things I thought I could do since I'm going to die... I still can... Damn you. What the fuck are you doing? That's dangerous! That's one down! Century egg! A Yakuza? A civilian? I'm just a boxer. I don't want to shoot you. However... I'm leaving with her. When I thought I would die... Do you know? The most important virtue in life is humanity. Go. Thank you. That didn't hurt at all! What? You piece of shit! Idiot! Julie! Off with his head. What? No, stop. What? What's wrong? Sorry. I got a cramp in my leg. That hurts. I think. Fucking suffer! Back off. Give it back! It's stiff. Let go, fucker. Give it back. Come on. It's this shit! Damn. Now that's a sweet face. Yasu. Monica? Fuck no. Monica is the last. Shit. Don't give up. Just don't give up. This way. Come on! What? Put the gun on the floor. Come here. This is bad. Don't move! What's my excuse again? Right, I'll just say I'm infiltrating their ranks. I'm Ohtomo, a police officer from the Shinjuku North Police Bureau! You're a crooked cop! Motherfucker! Shit! Open fire! Are you Monica? She has nothing to do with this. She was being used. I already know all about it. There's one missing. By the way, why are you here? What? Well, whatever. Can you drive? What? What? Are you serious? It's the only way. Trust in Japanese cars. Now go! Fasten up! Hit it! You drive pretty well. But that was one lousy match you had. What? What's your family name again? Your first name. It's Leo, right? My family name is Katsuragi. You saw me fight? Downed by a weak punch. Now what? Are you going to quit boxing and join the underworld? No way. I just accidentally got caught up in all of this. Why not join me then? I can make you my number three if you join me now. Sorry, boxing is my thing. Then you shouldn't be driving a yakuza's car now. Get out somewhere. I'll take the wheel. Oh, right. You two, scatter these outside. Scatter those? Nothing will change even if we turn it over to the cops. Our group wasn't supposed to deal with this anyway. Goodbye. Get moving. Let's find a place to clean up the blood. Let's go. The morning light doesn't suit the wicked. - Come here! - What? What? You're covered in blood. Just get in! Yuri. What? Oh, she was my classmate. Ryuji? Good morning. What happened? What's up with you? You're drenched. It's nothing. That can't be right. It's really cold out here. You'll catch a cold. If you'd like... No, really. It's okay. Well... Congratulations. Thanks. See you. Excuse me, but are you really... He looked really happy, right? Well, it seemed that way. That's a relief. I'm happy for him. So? You no longer have a place to return to, right? If you don't mind a dirty room, do you want to come to my place? All right. I... will do my best to live. All right. It's cold. Let's run. Out! KOYO FISHERY You did it, Leo! You're a reborn man! Show them who you are! All right! Subtitle translation by Norman England
