(industrial sounds) (whoosh) (digital interference) (eerie music) (video cassette inserted) - Andy, Come on. (thunder booming) (knocking) - What?! What do you want?! - Uh, my cat. We were playing in the back- - Where?! - He got stuck in the tree. - I told you kids a hundred times! Stay away from my yard! I can't see a damn thing. - Yeah, we think he's hurt. Are you seeing this? - There ain't no cat! - [Andrew] Run! Oh my God, he's so mad. - [Bryce] Andy! - [Andrew] Bryce? - Please, Andy, help! Please help me! Andy! (door creaks) (door creaks) (door slams) (footsteps) - Did you leave the camera on? - Ha, I'm not an idiot, Tom. - [Tom] You ready? - Yep. Okay. (exhales) - What's up everybody? It's the Amazing Andy back at it again with another epic video. As always, remember to like and subscribe 'cause we're... (rock music) (Andrew giggles) - [Narrator] Prank! - Tom just got Mean Spirited! (cartoony noise effects) (metal clang, groaning) (laughing audio effect) - All my wonderful Mean Spiriters, I've got some exciting news for you. But first, new gear. On the website this Friday. (cash register dings) (slowed down) This Friday. Good. Now, the main course. Last week, I got an email from someone who I haven't heard from in two years. He's an old friend of the channel who you know and love. Bryce Levy. Thunderman himself. The gang and I are heading to his new house on the Poconos for a weekend of debauchery. (cartoon spring) For those of you who aren't familiar, Bryce and I actually started this very channel. Before he lost weight and his acne cleared up he was my... Yeah, he was my best friend. Now, he's a sellout... and a FAKE. Oh, you don't believe me? See for yourselves. - Can I actually fly through a glass window unharmed? Bryce Levy can't, but Thunderman can. - Right? What a douche. "Thunderman can." Dude, who talks like that? Seriously. Nobody! When you've known Bryce as long as I have, man, you can tell when he's putting on a face. I guess, what, money can't hide everything huh? Even in LA when there's new faces on every corner. Hashtag, you know, plastic surgery! (high-pitched) Plastic surgery! Look, I'm gonna get real with you. Bryce and I have been best friends since...four years old, dude, four? Diapers, man. (baby crying) And now no calls, no texts. Dude doesn't even follow me on Insta. (fail trumpet) Look, it's his loss though, right? Because this weekend I'm gonna get to the bottom of why he ghosted his friends and sold his soul for a ticket to Hollywood. In honor of reaching 35,000 followers I'm making my first ever vlogumentary. - [Tom] What, we are? - Yeah. Get ready for an exclusive inside look at how fame and success corrupts your mind. I'm calling it "The Deterioration of Bryce and Andrew." With that, I'd like to thank our Patreon supporters for making this channel possible. As a reminder, all new supporters of the channel will get a sexy video from Tom. - No, no. I'm just gonna be the one filming everything. - Lame! One day we'll see Tom's freaky side come out. I just know it. Until then, we are Mean Spirited. SKRT, SKRT! (rock jingle) (video tape inserted) (electronic rock music) What you up to, Tom? How's it going? - Hey, I've been packing the car for 45 minutes. What have YOU been up to? - [Andrew] Well, my Hot Pocket exploded in the microwave, Tom. Loosen up, dude. Seriously, try to have some fun this weekend. - I'm fun, I'm loose. I'm loose ma-goose, man. I'll be even looser after I have a few niners tonight. - [Andrew] What? - Niners, like 9%? The guy at the beer store called them niners. - [Andrew] Cute. The bag come with the beers? - Oh my gosh, it's Nikki's! - Right, Nikki. Tom's imaginary girlfriend. - You're literally the only one who hasn't met her. - [Andrew] She's the one responsible for plucking my delicate little flower, oh my God! (alarm blaring) One-two-three-four-five-six-seve (bell dings) All right folks, I think we razzed Tom enough for now. We out, baby! Off to the Poconos! (rock music) (ding) (brakes screech) (easy listening music) - [Nikki] Oh, Joey. Tom shared that buffalo chicken dip recipe with me. Oh my God. We made it every day last week, right? - [Tom] Mmmhhm. - Nice. Yeah, I just got really high watching Cowboy Bebop and threw half my fridge in a crockpot. - I love that. You guys should turn that into a show actually. "Cooking With Joey." I'm just saying, it might take the channel to the nice level. - Hmm. I don't know if we'd have time for that, but yeah, it could be fun. - He's intimidated. - [Tom] So you two seem to be hitting it off. - Don't force it, Tom. - [Tom] I'm not forcing anything! - But yes, we're best friends now. Right, Joey? (cartoon spring) - [Nikki] This is nice. Is your friend a doctor or something? - [Andrew] God no, he's a bartender. He lives in that fucking thing. Yo Dew! Let's go, man! (Andrew honks) (beer cans spill) - Woo baby! Oh yeah. What you up to? (doors slam) - [Andrew] What's up? - I'm gonna literally fucking kill someone this weekend. Good to see you. How you been? Who the fuck are you? - [Tom] Dew, this is Nikki. My girlfriend. - You guys are right, he is charming. - You two ding dongs meet in church or something? - [Tom] Dew, no, for the last time, I haven't been to church in like a year. I'm a heathen now, remember? - [Dew] Oh nice. So y'all are gonna be boning all weekend. - [Tom] I told you he was gonna be like this. Why do we even invite him? - Hey fuck you, Tom! It was supposed to be a guys weekend, okay? It's gonna be lame having chicks around the men. - Ow! - [Nikki] What about Joey? - Joey doesn't count. She's cooler than either of these chodes. - [Andrew] Ew, shut up, dude, and get in. Let's go. - Fucking aye, Andy. Come on. - Watch the shoes! - [Dew] Okay, Jesus! (rock music) - Carrots make your dick smaller! - Tom, put your seatbelt on. - "Yes dear." Dew! - Stop. - What? It doesn't make any sense! We're outside! ♪ I know you know that I'm not perfect ♪ ♪ Not even close, but still ♪ ♪ I'll be the one who hangs on this ♪ - [Andrew] All right, quick stop y'all. - [Dew] Holy shit. This place is a shithole. (eerie sting) (water splashing) - [Tom] Dew, come on. Hurry up, man. - [Dew] No way, dude. (Dew farts) - [Andrew] Tom, you see this? Look at this guy. - [Tom] Oh my God. Wow! Oh wow, he can play a priest, a cowboy, a pharaoh, or a ninja. Okay, talk about range. - "Marlow Bookman." "Professionally trained actor." "Suited for your birthday, wedding, and FUNERAL needs." What do you think? Don't mind if I do, Mr. Bookman. Thank you. In fact, I'll take a couple. - [Host] The Union Resort has everything your heart desires. From horseback riding...to wine making. From sleeping in...to sleeping in. (girl moans) It's romantic and full of adventure. You only get one life. So live yours a little more with us. Today. (sensual music) - [Nikki] That was terrifying. - [Joey] That was amazing. - Yeah, terrifyingly amazing. You have such good taste, Joe. - [Dew] Folks! That's why you never eat sushi from a gas station. Unless you're a fucking champ. - So my brothers moved upstate a few years ago and my sister lives in Portland, Maine. And they're all married with kids which is fine, but I'm just trying to have a good time right now. - Yeah, same here. I guess that's why we keep Tom around. Just don't hurt him okay? He's our delicate little flower. (fly buzzing) - Please please please go away. - Please, please go away! - [Nikki] Hey. What's on the car? - [Dew] Oh shit! Check it out. (tense music) Nice. - [Andrew] What is it? - Bloody postcard. - Let me see this. Yeah, this wasn't me. - [Tom] Never know when to stop do you? - Dude, Why would I smear blood on my own van, man? - [Joey] To throw us off. - Yeah, true, but still, I didn't do it. I don't want it. - That's what I love about you, Andy. You're stubborn. Just like me. - There's someone watching us. - [Andrew] Whoa, whoa, can we help you? - [Tom] Stop, man! - Fucking relax, guys! It's the Poconos, baby! These people are freaks. - [Nikki] Can you stop? You're freaking us out! - [Joey] Crazy that didn't work. - Let's just get out of here. - Did you film that? That was fucked up. (Andrew laughs) [Andrew] All right, let's go. (distorted static) - I'm telling you guys, it was at her Sweet 16. Her parents went to pay the bill and she snuck her hand down my pants. And the rest, as they say, is laundry. 'Cause I had to wash my jeans after. - Bullshit. - Disgusting. - You got a handjob from Christine Rooney? - Hell yeah, brother. Who didn't? - [Tom] No, he's lying. - Oh, sorry. Story's not clean enough for you, Tom? - Your stories aren't clean enough for the bathroom floor, okay? - Nikki, as the newest member to this group of bad asses. - [Joey] Oh my fucking god. - What is it that you do for a living? - I'm an actor. - Oh. - But during the day I work at a law firm. - Oh, cool, one of our friends is an actor. - Oh my God, no way. - Yes, yes, he's who we're going to see. - Wait, are you serious? - Yes, yes, yes. Did Tom not tell you? - [Joey] She's fucking with you, dumbass. (Nikki laughs) - I'm sorry. That was way too easy. I can't believe you guys are friends with Bryce Levy. That guy's like a zillionaire. - A zillionaire who wet the bed 'til he was 13. - Andy's just a tiny bit jealous of course. - Yeah, just a little. - I'm not jealous. Fuck off, Joey. (phone dings) Boom! Ha! Joey look at this. One new subscriber. Someone who follows me for my content. Not my six pack. Amazing Andy ain't jealous of shit, thank you very much. - [Joey] Clearly. - [Tom] You sure you're gonna be all right this weekend, man? - Me? Yeah! I'm good, baby! I'm peachy! - Don't worry everybody, Andrew's peachy. Like the time his remote mysterious crashed into the wall during Bryce's MTV Movie Awards speech. - No! - Or the time he was throwing tomatoes at the Thunderman billboard and he said he was "sleepwalking." - Or how about when he uploaded that 40-minute video of him just crying and screaming. "Bryceeeee! - "Bryceeeeee!" - "Bryceeeeee!" - Guys, GUYS, stop! I'm good. - [Joey] Oh shit! It's that creepy hotel from the bloody postcard. - [Nikki] Really? How can you tell? - [Joey] Because I have it right here. - Oh my God! - [Group] (clamoring) - Joey, that's just weird! - Why do you have that? - Stop, stop! (electro-pop music) - [Nikki] Wow! - Let's do it. - [Nikki] Wow wow wow. (eerie music) Wow. - [Andrew] Thomas Kelly, cameraman extraordinaire, recovering from his harrowing battle with Christianity. - Get that out of my face, come on. - Come on, let's do a quick intro. - This place is sick. - All right. What's up, Mean Spiriters? We've arrived at famous "actor" Bryce Levy's monster home. Get ready for three days inside the belly of the beast. - [Bryce] Please tell me you didn't bring your stupid camera this weekend. - [Dew] Woo! (thunder booming) - Please tell me you brought a shirt this weekend. - It's hot out, man. I'm fixing the plumbing. Seriously Tom, ditch the camera, dude. - You won't notice, man. It's a little vlogumentary. - Bryce! How are you, man? It's been too long! My God! - Yeah, no, I missed you guys. - Wow! Look at him. - This weekend is gonna be amazing. I'm gonna shower real quick and then we'll head out. Make yourselves at home. - All right. (electric zap) - [Joey] Try not to drool too much. - Psh, what? No. He's not even my type. Absolutely not. - [Joey] Don't worry, I won't tell Tom you've got the hots for Thunderman. He probably does too. - You trained every day for six months? It's like a washboard. - Tom, are you good? - Yeah, yeah, sorry. No no, I'm just impressed. It's impressive. - Bryce, this place is fantastic. - [Bryce] Thank you. - [Joey] I love all the crazy Jesus stuff. - [Tom] It's a bit much even for me. - Oh, guys, just a reminder, septic is clogged. So, number ones only. There's an outhouse in the back. - What about in the sink? - [Bryce] No! - Tom. Let's go. (soft fart) (water splashing) - I think you should take this room. And I... Will take this very room. Never mind. (thud) Probably a sex dungeon of sorts. Tom, have any thoughts about this? - [Tom] What? It's a locked room, who cares? - Yeah, exactly, man. That's why we gotta check it out. He's probably hiding kinky shit in here. - [Bryce] Yeah, tons of kinky shit. Same old Andy. Can't help but pry into everyone's business huh? Just joshin'. Come on, drop your shit. Let's go grab a beer. - [Dew] All right, before anyone asks, I just wanted to mention that I'll be off my diet this weekend, okay? I'm down 20 L-Bees. But on Monday, back to eating like Thunderman. I don't know if you noticed, but I was eating carrots earlier instead of chips. - Nice. - Hey! Another round of piss, please! (spits) - This place is interesting, Bryce. Charming yet rustic. - Yeah. I mean it's a shithole, but I love it. - [Joey] Aren't you afraid someone will recognize you? - People here don't really watch much TV honestly, so it's kind of the perfect place to get away. Some peace and quiet. - Gosh Bryce, when's the last time we even saw you, man? I feel like it's been forever. - It was probably Oktoberfest two years ago. Right before Bryce fell off the face of the Earth. - Sorry, Andy. Maybe they can reschedule the Emmys next year. - Well maybe they can. I don't know. - Yeah, totally. - No, yeah, look, I'm sorry. I know I've been a bit of a flake lately. It just feels like I'm barely living my own life these days honestly. - Oh yeah, sure. - You've been busy. - I mean it's understandable. - Yeah. - But that being said, that is why I bought a house so close to home. So I can reconnect with all my old friends. - Aw, you miss us that much huh? - Just you, Andy. I came back just for you. - [Nikki] Aww, so cute! - So gay. - [Tom] Don't say that, Dew. - It's fine to say. (glasses spill) You do that on purpose, tough guy? - [Tom] Dude! - You should go back to Jersey, you trash tourists. - Hey, Jersey? This is America, motherfucker! This is not how you treat a veteran of the Iraq War! Fuck off, Tom. - Hey hey hey, okay. I think it was just an accident, right? - Yeah. An accident. - Awesome. You're good man, come on. Have a seat. All right, moving on. Cheers, everybody. To a weekend full of adventure. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Another round, butterfingers! (tense music) - Shoot. - What's up? - Do you have any shoes in that bag? Did I pack my hiking boots in here? - Let's see, I don't know... Whoa, what the hell is this? - It's old. My mom probably stuck it in there. It's... She thinks Andy's a bad influence, so. - Whoa. Looks like mom was right. - Crap. Uh, I didn't mean anything. I just thought, you know... - You just thought what, that we'd have sex and then you'd just show off to all your friends? - No, no, no no no no no. Not at all. I just, I meant like... - I'm kidding. I think it's cute you thought ahead. We'll see. - Okay. We'll see. - Yeah. I don't want your friends to hear us or whatever. - Hear us? Oh. Oh yeah, hear us, yeah. Well, don't worry about them. They're all extremely mature. (phone rings) - [Christine] Hello? - Christine, yeah, hi. It's Dew and Andy from Watchung Hills. Was just hoping you could settle something. Did you give me a... handjob at your Sweet 16? Christine? - [Christine] Grow up, Dew. - She didn't say no! - You are so pathetic, dude. Seriously, you're fucking disgusting. - Oh my God, you and I are like the exact same person, Andy. - [Joey] After the fire, they searched the place for hours and ended up finding 10 bodies lining the walls of the hotel. With all of their hands missing. - [Nikki] Oh gross. Who would want someone's hands? - Nobody knows. But I just imagine there's some guy somewhere with a closet. Full of hands! - Jesus. - I got you. - Did you mean to hide your hands? - I don't know. - Tom, let me film something. - [Tom] What? No, you literally have peanut butter on your fingers. - I'll be careful. - [Tom] No, you don't have that capability. - At least wash your hands. - Sorry, sorry. I ran next door to grab some wood. My neighbors always have a huge pile. - Okay, can we do this already? I'm starting to fade. - Do what? - An abomination. The scariest, most evil thing man has ever created. (tense music) Ouija. It's Ouija. (woman screaming) (demonic vocals) - Hands in the middle. Will we have a yummy dinner tonight? (sarcastic oohing) - Oh wow. Good question, Tom. Uh, has Tom ever had sex? Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Shit, dude. - Sorry, Nikki. - I got one. - Who here lied about getting a handjob at a Sweet 16? - Ooh! - That's not me. We called, it's... Okay, fuck this. This is bullshit. Whatever. - Hey Bryce, you want to ask something? - No, you know that I don't. That's probably why you chose to play this game. - Whoa, holey moley. Are you seeing this? - Joe, you messing with the board, dude? - Obviously not. - Ouija board, who here controls you? - Andy. Stop, dude. - Is Bryce hiding something? - Fucking stop. - Is he even our friend anymore? - Andy, seriously. Fucking stop. - Did he ditch us all to join a crazy Hollywood sex cult? - I said fucking stop! (glass shatters) - Dude, what is your problem, man? - You, fuckface. - Dude, it was a fucking prank, Thunderman! - Now's my chance. I gotta take a shit. Don't tell Bryce. - No no no no, dude dude dude! I swear if you break it I will break your face! (western guitar) - A ranger out in the open. A stone cold killer. ♪ Ba-Da-Da ♪ ♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun, DUNNNN! ♪ (mouth bullets) - And then Andy, just put in some badass gunshots or something. Oh shit. Fuck. Jesus. (toilet flushes) Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, baby, yeah! It flushed. Thank you, Jesus! Fuck. (tense music) - [Dew] What the fuck? Hey Bryce? Bryce? Bryce, I went to pee and a little doody came out. It flushed though, so no big deal. - [Andrew] We were just screwing around, dude. He's gotta learn to take a joke. - Maybe, but I mean you're kind of being a prick, dude. Okay? Just try to chill out. - I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one? - Nah. - [Dew] What the fuck? (eerie music) (Dew breathing heavy) (dramatic sting) Oh my God! (distorted music) (video tape inserting) - End of an era. Any last words? - [Andrew] Are you serious, dude? You're leaving right now and you didn't feel the need to tell your best fucking friend, man? - [Bryce] Well I'm telling you right now. - So what, the channel can just rot? Can you stop filming me, dude? - [Bryce] I know what it's like. Your worst moment seen on camera. I figured you'd want the footage, no? Here you go, come on. Erase it if you want. We both know you won't though. (engine revs) Thunderman out. (distant heavy breathing) (video tape ejecting) (electronic rock music) - [Marlow] Out of curiosity, how did you hear about my work? - [Andrew] Yeah, just from a flyer. - [Marlow] Right right right. How many outfits will you need? - [Andrew] So just the priest outfit actually because we're recreating an exorcism scene for a vlogumentary. - [Marlow] I love a good exorcism. Oh this is fantastic. You know, I was doing this show last summer, Shakespeare in the park, and it was interrupted by- - See you tomorrow night! Fucking loser. Okay, yeah. Oh shit, editor's note, cut the call. And start it here. What's up guys? Coming in hot! Bryce Levy's house, day two. Last night was good. As you can see, Bryce clearly has some issues. (glass shatters) Whoa, dude! I wasn't able to get all the answers I was looking for. Must be all that Thunderman armor he's got built up. But today's a new day. Now lightning may strike first, but Bryce- - What are you doing? - Just jogging. Jogging, doing a vlog. You good? - Yeah. Sorry for snapping at you last night. - It's fine, we were drinking a lot and... You heading out or something? - What? - You heading out? - Yeah, I'm gonna go run and grab some eggs. Can't believe we ran out. - Huh. Weird. Breakfast of champions. Right here. (egg cracks) - Wha... Aww, why? - (Scottish accent) This young lassie here has a big day ahead of her. She's gonna need the strength. - Oh my God! Oh God, what is it? Andy you motherfucking piece of shit, I'm gonna kill you! - He's a big boy. Which means he needs twice the protein. (techno music) (Andy laughs) Oh my God. - Good morning, Andrew. Did I miss breakfast? - So the story is I was at the mall with my friend. I was looking for a new perfume. And Tom- - And I was buying new Ray-Bans. I wanted to utilize my 5% cash back. - You live quite the life, Tom. - Thank you, thank you. - God I was fucked up last night! Hope no one took advantage of me, right Tom? - Yeah. - Are you inferring Tom assaulted you? - Yeah. - That's offensive. - Don't worry about him. Are you okay, man? We heard some weird noises last night like you were laughing over and over again. - I don't fucking know, Tom, because I was blacked out 'cause I'm not a fucking pussy. Jo, can you pass the eggs? - We're heading out soon dude, so eat quick. - Andy, I will do my Tae Bo workout and then I will be ready to go. Diet's off, but I've gotta keep these babies toned! - Oh my... - Jesus. - [Tom] Dude. - Tae Bo, baby. - Morning, morning! - Morning. We're leaving in 30 minutes, so pack a swimsuit will you? - Okay, buddy. I'm gonna shower real quick if that's okay with you. Okay? Thunderman out. See you guys soon. - All right. - Hey, are you guys good after last night? - Yeah, baby. We're peachy. We're fine. - Just take it easy this week, okay? - Yeah, no more egg pranks. I still have that nasty goo on me. (Dew laughs) - Nice. - See, Dew thought it was hilarious. - What was hilarious? - The eggs. They're mad about the eggs. Didn't you think it was funny? (Dew laughs) (indie rock music) ♪ Be my, be my airplane ♪ ♪ Be my, be my lost control ♪ - There's this little banquet hall inside that burned down during a wedding. And now it's haunted by the bride and groom. - Wait, I don't get it. Why are you so obsessed with sneaking into haunted places? - [Joey] Because it's "romantic and full of adventure." - [Nikki] (laughs) Like the guy in the video! That's funny, Jo. - Yo Tom! Let me get some shots for the hiking montage. You know, like fast music, throwing leaves, come on. Excuse me, excuse me, beep beep, beep beep! Yeah, like fast music, throwing leaves, doing shit like that. Maybe in slow-mo or widescreen bars or something? I don't know. Montage, baby! (electro-pop music) MONTAGE! (yelling) Yeah! Fuck, they're in the trees! (gun noises) Nah. - [Narrator] Wow! Sick montage! - Good? That was good, right? Come on. Move it! - [Nikki] Nice cartwheel, man. - Thank you. Good. And ooh, too cool for school over here? What's going on, dude? - Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin your epic video. - Oh, well that's impossible 'cause actually you weren't in the video, so. - Oh yeah, wait, how's living with your parents again? - It's pretty good to me. I don't know, it's pretty fucking good. - Yeah, cool. - Yeah, cool bro! - Cool! - Cool! - [Tom] Peachy, huh? - Eat my ass, dude. (techno music) - [Andrew] Bryce! - Woo! - [Andrew] Wasn't set up yet, dude! - Dude, don't even get near me, dude. Don't even, don't. - Tommmm I'm not, I won't. - I'm serious. - [Joey] Leave him alone, Dew. - Come on, I'm just trying to help him. - I'm fine. - He's fine. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - He's gonna jump down and be with Nikki and her new boyfriend Bryce. - Shut up! Everybody just shut up! - [Dew] Woo baby! (big splash) - Fun day at the falls with our friends vinegar and antacid. (fish slap) - Woo! - [Bryce] Coming Tom? - [Joey] Andy, what are you doing? - Whoa! (splash) - Hey Tom, you nailed that landing, man. - Okay, Dew, can you give him some space please? - [Joey] What the hell happened? Andrew snuck up on me. I missed the whole thing. - Andy, you do this? One of your stupid fucking pranks? - No, dude. Okay? I was trying to scare him, but I- - What? The Amazing Andy couldn't help himself and almost gets his best friend killed. Got it. Cool. (whimpering) - I was up there. On the edge and... It was like... It felt like something was pulling me. Did you see anything? Anybody? - I didn't see shit, dude. - Let's just head back, okay? - Whoa whoa whoa whoa, we're still gonna see The Union though right? - [Joey] Hell yeah we are. - Tom literally almost just died. - I'm good. I'm good. - Boom, see? He's fine. - Guys, it'll be worth it. I promise. - [Bryce] It's actually the only resort still standing. Probably because it's so haunted. Right Jo? - I mean The Poconos used to be the "Honeymoon Capital of the World." Now it's more like the Divorce Capital of the World, am I right? - Not your best, Joe. - I thought it was clever. - They tried to build a bunch of casinos to get all the tourists back. But they all burnt down within one year. The townies call it "The Great Fire." - So the townies definitely burnt those casinos down, right? - Yeah, maybe. I mean the townies definitely blame the tourists for ruining their homes. I think some people just can't deal with change. - [Andrew] Perfect. - Always ruining the moment, Andy. - [Andrew] Fuck off. Thought it was cool. - Shall we? - [Joey] Yo! (techno-pop music) - Hey Nikki! Found some dinner! - Oh my God! - [Host] It's romantic and fun. - Look at this fucking place. Tom, this is like exactly how you described your dream wedding. - Shut up, Dew. - [Joey] Can you imagine getting married here? It's like the freakin' Twilight Zone. - Check it out. Wow. Hey Tom! Go long! - Jeez, what the... - What the fuck, Dew? - Heck, Dew? - Calm down. - You could've given me hepatitis or something. What's wrong with you? - You can't catch hep when you're saving yourself for Jesus, Tom. - I told you I'm not saving myself- - Guys, come check this out! - It's okay. - [Andrew] Holy shit this is a gold mine. - Bryce, I'm bunking in here tonight. - [Andrew] Aw Joey. (goofy babbling) - Ooh. - [Nikki] Oh my God. Andy, don't touch those. - [Andrew] I'm just trying to get the shots. - Oh yeah, he's just trying to get the super cool shot. (Andrew blows raspberries) - Still warm. - [Joey] Wait, seriously? - No. Would've been cool though. - (sarcastic) Yeah, totally cool. Can we please go now? - [Andrew] Let's keep moving. Hey Tom, can you take this camera back? - Yeah. (eerie static) - [Tom] Oh my gosh. Whoa. - Yo, make sure you get a shot of that mirror. Ha! Creepy. Oh my God, guys guys guys. What do you think it means? Nikki? - I don't care. I'm leaving. - Come on dude, seriously? Dude, it was probably kids or something. Come on. - Come on, there's a whole other floor we still haven't seen yet. - If you want to stay and get stabbed by townies, Andrew, be my guest. - Hey, let's just go back. We can drink some niners, we can relax. - You guys are acting like babies right now. Let's at least see the gym! - Did you not see the blood? - Guys, come on, okay, Andrew's right. Let's just cancel all of our plans and we can do whatever he wants. - Aw you're such a nice guy, Bryce. You got them all fooled don't you? - [Tom] Hey, come on guys. - Oh you're mad now? You're gonna cry and throw your beer again, B-B-Bryce? (thud) (Nikki screams) - Get it off of me! - [Dew] Calm down, calm down! Everyone calm down! (eerie music) He's dead. - [Nikki] I'm gonna be sick. (static) (car door slams) - [Tom] Hey, you okay? - I want to go home. - Yeah, I mean I wish that we could, you know? But we all drove here together. I mean everyone would have to leave. - Or we could leave and they could find another way. - Well I can ask. But it's late, maybe we should try in the morning? Oh shoot. - All right, fuck me, let's do it. (clears throat) Okay. What's up everybody, it's Amazing Andy. Back at it again sitting in an outhouse. It's kind of symbolic of how this entire weekend is going. (sighs) Fuck me, that's stupid. All right. What's up everybody, it's Amazing Andy here. I'm in an outhouse, but I'm not using it. As you can see. (fart noise) Look, I'm keeping things off social for the time being. But trust me, you guys are gonna blow your minds when you see this shit. Bryce, if you see this. Which you won't 'cause you don't even fucking follow me, dude. (loud rustling) Someone there? Hello? (sighs) You got this, dude. You deserve this. You fucking deserve this. (eerie music) - [Bryce] Tom, you think Nikki wants any? - Oh, uh, maybe. I'll go check. - [Bryce] Yeah, sounds good. - [Joey] Oh this is gonna be good. - What were you doing in my room? - Nikki asked for some melatonin. And now she's knocked out. Chill out, dude. - Let's forget about the fucking dead body for a second Bryce, right? In the past 36 hours we still had, hello! In the past 36 hours, a creepy bartender who tried to fight Dew. Tom, falling off a fucking waterfall. Which wasn't creepy, but still hilarious. And a bloody note from the visitor center. - Bloody note? - Yeah, there was a gross bloody note on the van on the way here and a goat dude staring at us. Remember that guy? Which was fucking weird. - Okay, so a few weird things happened to us. - A few weird things? Dude, Nikki was tackled by a corpse. - Lucky bitch. - Andy's just butthurt 'cause Bryce kicked his ass! - Shut up, Dew. Fuck you. - Okay okay, enough. All right? Enough. I'm trying to be a good host. But no offense, Tom, you fell off a cliff. We ventured into a dangerous hotel. And Andy, you're a terrible driver. Okay? You guys are making something out of absolutely nothing. - Then explain the bloody note. - I can't, I wasn't there. You probably did it as one of your stupid fucking pranks. - Yeah, dude, honestly I wish I did 'cause it was fucking amazing. - Okay. So. We good? Tom? - Oh yeah, I'm good. I think I just need to relax tonight, you know? - I've got an idea. Tom! Run! - [Dew] Run, Tom! You pussy! - Now you gotta go to the graveyard. - Oh God, thanks Jo. Super relaxing game. - We can play bible trivia next time. - Oh yeah, you'll lose that for sure. - What do I dO? - Okay, Dew. You're locked in the killer's basement. Lose two health while you pee your pants. - That means you take a shot. - All right, done. - Just a shot. - Jesus Christ. (Dew burps) - [Andrew] You good, dude? - Shh shh shh shh. - Dude, what are you doing? - I'm peeing. - [Andrew] No, stop, stop! You don't have to actually do that. - All right, all right, my turn. Here we go. This one's for you, Andy. - You're trapped in a strange house reading from a locked box. (speaking latin) - [Joey] You banish the demons away. Move ahead three spaces. - Guess I'm just lucky. - Shocker. (blood-curdling scream) (tense music) - [Joey] What the fuck? - [Tom] Are you okay? - [Joey] Where is she going? - [Tom] Nikki? - You ever crave a cookie and you just need that cookie? So you go get the cookie. But it doesn't satisfy you, it just keeps you wanting more and more and more. Don't even think about it, Tom. - Think about what? - We are not having sex tonight. (Dew laughs) - What the fuck did you give her? - [Dew] It's supposed to be melatonin. - [Tom] Nikki wait, where are you going? Hey. Hey hey- - Take your filthy paws off me! - Blue is melatonin. Purple is Adderall. Red is... Fuck, what's red? - Give me one of the reds. - Fuck off. - This turned out to be quite the interesting night. - Right up your alley huh? - I'm torn. This is hilarious, but I hope she's okay. - I'm sure she'll be fine. She'll be fine. If she passes out in a port-a-potty at a Kid Rock concert then you can worry. Jesus! - [Andrew] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! (glass breaks) (static noise) - Tom you owe me a new lens, dude. Luckily we didn't lose the footage or I'd kill the bitch. Kidding. Cut that, don't cancel me. (clicks) (screaming) (replays screaming) Holy shit. (eerie music) Oh God. Dew has superpowers? (snort laughs) Fuck me I'm drunk. Aw fuck! Yo, Bryce? Where are the towels? Bryce. (door creaking) Hello? (eerie music) Bryce. Holy shit. God, dude. Bryce, what are you doing? (eerie music crescendos) (video tape inserted) (Young Bryce muffled screaming) - [Old Man] October 6th. Transference of power. Number 11. Shh! Quiet boy! Listen to me! 10 boys have sat where you're sitting right now. You see that camera? (demonic voice) Huh? It sees you, I'm giving you a gift. And you deserve it. (speaking Latin) (demonic growling) (video tape ejects) (electronic rock music) - I set out on this trip to get some answers. About why Bryce and I stopped being friends. I found the answer. Just not the one I wanted. I wish I could say my work here is done. But it's only just begun. Ugh, that was so fucking stupid. Bryce Levy is a demon. At least I think he is. This morning I contemplated taking the van and just leaving. But I'm not that shitty of a friend am I? No. In fact, I'm a great friend. If we're gonna get the old Bryce back we've gotta destroy the new one. Day three. "The Fall of Thunderman." (thunder booming) Yeah. (tense music) - [Bryce] Andrew. - [Andrew] Jesus! You scared me. - Sorry. Come on. Breakfast is on the patio. - [Andrew] Cool, yeah, I'll tell the group. - Let them sleep. We should talk. - [Andrew] Oh my God. - You know, the best moments are the moments that happen off camera. - Totally. But in case that psycho from Joey's game cuts my head off I'll have proof, right? - Assuming that psycho would upload your murder to the internet. - If the footage is good, why not? - We'll see. (Bryce chuckles) Eat up, come on. It's hot. - Yeah, thank you. Did you pray? - Yeah. - To God? (Bryce laughs) - You ever think about people from high school? - I try not to. - Do you remember Katie Perkins? Senior year? She had those bangs. - Yeah, love Katie. - Yeah. I've been thinking about her a lot lately. We used to go on trips like this together. - That's kind of weird isn't it? - Yeah. Just, I guess it felt incomplete how we left things. So I reached out. She's a mom now. Three kids, a husband. She sounded really happy. - Good for her, good. - I wonder if that would've been me though, you know? If I didn't move away. She moved on without me and didn't miss a beat. Like I meant nothing. - Yeah, feels awful doesn't it? - Yeah. It does. (Andrew laughs) What? - I didn't think you cared about anything from high school. So I guess the old you is still in there, huh? - Bryce cares. Thunderman can't. - So, I don't know, which one am I talking to? (tense music) (thud) - [Dew] Woohoo! - Holy shit. - Hell yeah. - [Bryce] Tada! - OHHH!!! Fuck yes! (laughs) What? I love weapons. - All right, 10 throws each. Whoever hits the most targets wins. - I'm gonna sit this one out. There's a little too much testosterone out here for me. - If we're going to be competitively axe throwing, Andy and I need to be drunk. - No. No dude, stop including me. We're not on a fucking team. - God, it's 10 AM. - (mocking) "It's 10 AM!" It's fucking Saturday, Tommy! Grow some chest pubes. - Don't listen to him, Tom. Chest hair's gross. And it's Sunday, dumbass. - The Lord's day, right Bryce? - I guess I'm going to Hell. - [Tom] Whoa! (rock music) - Careful Jo. - Woo! - Fuck yeah. - [Tom] Nikki are you sure you're okay after last night? - Never been better. (thud) - [Andrew] Whoa! - [Dew] Woo! - Fuck yeah! Suck on that, bitches! - [Joey] Damn Nikki, that was awesome! - [Nikki] I know. - Bryce, get out of the way. I'm gonna do it over the head. Ooh, ooh! (clang) - [Bryce] Dew, you suck, man. - Ugh! Sorry, Bryce. (Tom laughs) Tom, you got something to fucking say? - No no. No, I just have allergies. - Oh allergies? Little bitch, come here. What's the problem? You're such a little bitch, Tom. - I'll show you who's a little- - Ooh! Let's go, bud! Let's go right now! Fucking say it! - Move, move. Take this, Andy. This one's for you. - Hey Andy. Hey. Get this on YouTube, okay? Tom's a little bitch. - Hey, watch and learn. Watch and learn, baby. (loud splat) - [Dew] (laughs) What a fucking idiot, dude. He can't even throw an axe the right way, okay? - Oh my God! - [Andrew] Dude, dude, dude! - What? What? Is my ass hanging out? - Dew, sit still. This is so awesome. - [Tom] So gross. - Dude, keep the camera on it, man. Joey, you sure you know what you're doing? - No, but nobody else stepped up. And plus Dew would tell me if I hurt him. - Yeah, the guy who didn't feel an axe puncturing his back with, oh God, I looked again. - I don't feel anything, Tom. It's fine. - Should we just get him to a hospital? - And say what? We were drunkenly throwing axes at each other all day? Nah. I'm good. - What are you afraid of, dude? It was an accident. We'll say he slipped on it or something. - This can't be sanitary. - [Dew] Here, how about this? (beer spills) - [Group] Ooh! - Dew, stop! - [Andrew] Dude! (Dew vomiting) - [Joey] I really hope that's just vomit. - You guys don't think Dew's been acting strange this weekend? - No dude, he drank too much. He literally shotgunned 11 beers. - I know, but something feels off. Giving Nikki weird drugs, the axe. I get that we're light and loose, we're having fun, but someone could seriously get hurt. - Well he gets this way around girls, dude. He wanted a guys weekend remember? - Bryce, back me up. Come on. - Yeah, I mean I would say Dew's a pretty weird guy to begin with. But everyone has their demons. Look at Nikki. I need to run into town and grab some lighter fluid. You guys want to grab some subs? Andrew? - Yeah, I'd love a meatball sub, thanks. - No man, do you want to come with? I could use a second set of hands. - I'm going through the... Joey and I are going through the footage, so I can't come. Sorry. - I'll go. Get away from Dew. - That's perfect. Yeah, have fun, do it. - Andrew, you can look at the footage when you get home, man. It's our last day. - [Joey] Yeah, we can look at footage later. I'll stay and hang with the freaks. - Hey. Sounds like a plan. - Yeah, let's do it. - Let's do it. - Great, okay. - [Bryce] Cool. (tense music) - [Tom] I wonder what they're talking about. - Probably laughing more about you. Been calling you soft all morning ever since your tumble off the cliff. - [Tom] Wait, seriously? God he's such a freakin'... - Such a freakin' what? Say it. Come on. - [Tom] No, nothing. Never mind. Never mind. Hey! What was that about? - It's a secret. Why? What are you guys talking about? - It's a secret. (tense music) - Woo! We're on a boat! What do you say, Andy? - Good, I'm good. - [Joey] Uh, what are you doing? - [Dew] Me? I was bird watching. - I didn't know you were into birds. - [Dew] I love birds. - Okay. I'm gonna take the camera back now. If that's okay. - [Dew] Of course. - Fucking creep. There's definitely something wrong with him. - Dude, I'm telling you the truth. You gotta listen to me. - [Tom] You are completely out of your mind. - Well then explain the goat mask or the severed hands. - [Tom] I thought it was a deer mask. - Doesn't fucking matter what kind of mask it was, man. Look over there for a second, look. He's talking to that weird freak. Probably paying him money to fucking come over and chop our bodies up later, dude. - [Tom] (sarcastic) Yeah, and there's probably a severed head in that bag too. - Bryce is not the standup guy you think he is. See? - Rolling rolling. All right, Andy. What crazy footage couldn't wait 'til tomorrow? (clicking) (clicking) (screaming) (tense music) Oh shit! Dew. (whispers) Oh shit. Dew. (Nikki knocks) - [Nikki] It's Nikki, can you open up? - I'm kind of in the middle of something. What is it? - [Nikki] I finished my magazine. I want to grab another from my suitcase. - Your suitcase is empty. There's nothing in there. Sorry. (loud bang) - [Nikki] Oh, no worries. (door knob rattles) (demonic voice) Pretentious bitch. - (whispers) Fuck. (Dew tapping) - Jo! I left something in there! Can you open up? Or can you get it for me at least? - Yeah, here you go! (whispers) What the fuck? - You think he's a demon? - Yes, dude, yes. Or a spirit or fucking possessed or something. - You're full of crap. - Dude, I will show you when we get back to the fucking house, man. In the locked room. Also, dude, please say shit. You're saying crap and it's fucking weird. You're like a dad replacing shit with sugar. - Why do you care? - You're just stressing me out, you're wound up, okay? If you let it out every once in a while you'd feel better. - If anyone here's wound up it's you. You're the one who thinks that our friend is trying to kill us. - Dude. - Hey guys. What are you guys talking about? It's like a library. - Well Andrew here thinks that you're a-- OW! - I think you're a really talented actor, man. Fucking, yeah. - Thank you, Andrew. Means a lot, man. - Yeah. - Sorry, they were out of meatball. Whoops. Sorry buddy. - Sugar. (phone rings) - [911 Operator] 911 what's your emergency? (tense music) - Thunderman out! Come on Andrew, lighten up, dude! It's a boat ride! Supposed to be fucking fun, man! - Yeah, I'm having fun. - You'll have fun later, I promise. Have a nice fire. What the hell's going on here? - [Tom] I hope everyone's okay. - Here you go, Tom. - Started a drinking game, okay? - [Joey] Check your phone asshole. Yeah you, dumbass. - That's classic. That's classic. I'm gonna charge my phone, dude. - [Pat] How you boys doing? - Good, good, what's going on? - Joey got locked in her room, we tried to get her out. Couldn't. Called Officer Pat here. Listen, you're gonna be right back. Not worth breaking the glass. - You boys need anything you know where to find me. - Sounds good, yeah. - Thank you, officer. - Fucking pigs. - Tom get the fucking camera out of my face. - Sorry. (tense music) (Andrew knocks) - [Andrew] Joey open up. - Are you alone? And are you also acting fucking crazy? - Yes and no. You good? - Yes. - Okay, where we at? (tense music) - [Tom] Oops, zoom button's stuck. There we go, hey! What are you guys doing? - [Bryce] Nothing. Just waiting. - [Tom] Okay. Do you mind if I start? - [Bryce] Go for it. - [Tom] Alright. Banana peppers all day, people. All day, that's what I'm talking about. Hey, who's with me? Banana peppers team huh? Guys? - What should we call it? - Hollywood's Bryce Levy is Secretly a Demon. Live Possession, Near Death Footage, 10,000 Foot Drop, and Fortnite Cheat Codes. - All of that? Really? - Yes. - Okay done. Uploading. (floorboards creaking) (tense music) (more creaking) I'm done. The minute they're asleep I'm out. - What about Tom? - If you want to risk your life for Tom, that's on you, but I'm getting the fuck out of here. - Wait wait wait wait, have you seen the van keys? - I think they're in the basement. - Shit. - [Tom] Some gorgeous B-roll shots for you, Andy. You will thank me later, I promise. I mean this place is just so beautiful. The sunset, trees. And Bryce the chef. I mean what can't this guy do huh? What a guy. (Tom chuckles) What... A guy. (booming noise) (police radio chatter) - [Pat] Officer Pat here. Pulling back up to the house now. Hey bud, sorry to drop in again! Just gotta do a quick sweep of the house if that's okay. - You forget something? - [Pat] Nah, just following protocol. - Of course, of course. Let me show you. - [Pat] I appreciate it. I'm sure you boys are fine. It's just... Wait, wait, STOP! (chair squeaking) - Would you stop for a second? (sighs) Shit, it's 42%. Fuck me. All right. I'm gonna make a break for the van keys. Watch out. Keep this window locked. And trust nobody but me, alright? - I trust no one outside of this room. - Good. Fuck. Ow, fuck! See you in a minute. (chair squeaking) - I saw you through the window. - It was nothing. - It didn't look like nothing. - She was just helping me cook, Tom. - With your shoulders? (plate shatters) Whoa! - Yeah. With my shoulders. - Uh. Okay. Oh, Nikki. I saved you a seat. Next to me. - You're such a good little boy! - The happy couple. (Dew grunts) (eerie music) (bag dragging) (sighs) (Nikki laughs) - Okay, I think I'm gonna head to bed. I'm just not really hungry. - Aww. - Aww. - Tom, you can rest when you're dead. Okay? Hey Nick, could you keep our boy here distracted while I go start the fire? - Absolutely. (bag dragging) - Dew? Dew what are you... Dew, you're leaking all over the- - Oh Tommy, you're so easily distracted. - Sixty...three...percent. (slow tapping) - Andrew? - ["Andrew"] Joey? Open up quick before someone sees! - Shut the fuck up or they'll hear you. - I think you're right. Maybe we should head to bed. (faint bang) - You hear that? Who is it? Is that Andrew? What's he doing? What's going on? What's he doing? - Andrew? (inhuman scream) - [Tom] What was that? - You're so easily distracted. (suspense music) (creepy music) (clicks) - Oopsies. - [Tom] (distant) Oh my God, oh my God! - Oh my God. - Oh my God! Oh my... Oh my God, I've never noticed how dark your eyes are. Ow! Do that again. Ow! Oh God! Oh my... (fading) No... - Ow, fuck. - What took you so long? - I got the keys. - Tom and Nikki are fucking. (distant moaning) - Heh, okay. Where we at? - It's finished. - It's done? Did it post? - You're gonna be famous, sweetie. - Great. Let's grab Tom and get the fuck out of here. - No, if we go now they'll know. They're all over the place. Let's just go downstairs, get them liquored up, wait for them to fall asleep, and then make a break for it. Can you handle that? - Andrew can't. But the Amazing Andy can. Game over, bitch. (keys jingle) - Oh baby, things are heating up! That's what I'm talking about! Hey, where is she? There she is! Hey, this my girl right here! Hey, it's last night in town everybody, let's turn up! - Woo! - Let's, ooh. - What? - Got a little reflux or something. Is that normal after- - Yo, let's get turn up y'all! I got some beers here. Yo, we gotta get lit tonight. We gotta get fucked up, want some beer? Come on. - [Tom] Nah, I'm already turnt man, I'm good. - Hey! - [Tom] Yo, what's up? - My God, Joey, your hair looks so good. So much better than mine. - Please, have you seen yourself? Hashtag goals! - Yeah, whoa, "hashtag goals!" Huh, alright. Oh! - Fire's ready. - [Nikki] Woo! - Okay, hey, okay. Our delicate little flower's withered away, huh? (tense music) (handle jiggles) (sighs) God help me. Let's get this party started! What do you say? Yo Bryce, when you going back to LA, dude? - Haven't decided yet. - I'd be dying to get back. I mean beaches, mansions, models. What a life huh? - Everywhere has its flaws, Tom. - Hey, not Jersey. - Especially Jersey. My life isn't exactly what you think it is, Tom. - I'd still take your life over mine any day. - Yeah, it's a little like when rich people tell you money doesn't buy happiness. Might be true, but I think I'd rather find out the hard way. (Tom laughs) - Joey, I can't believe this is our last night together. I feel like we just became best friends. - I know, I feel the exact same. I wish we could stay here forever. - [Nikki] Me too. - Well we threw their van keys in the woods, so now we can. (Nikki, Bryce, and Joey laugh) - I'm so glad this worked out, Bryce. I've had a blast. - [Andrew] Yeah, we know, dude. We heard all 30 seconds Of it. - Piss off, Andy. It was longer than that. Check the tape. I saw. - Were you recording? - It's a nice memory. - Proof of your sin, dude. Having sex before marriage. Dude, what are your parents gonna think? - Fuck you, Andy! - Tommy. - Seriously, just shut the fuck up okay? Joey and I bend ourselves over backwards for your channel and all you do is treat me like some intern that you can mess with. - Dude, what are you talking about? - I'm not your crazy sidekick, Andy. Not everyone's purpose in life is to help the Amazing Andy, okay? This weekend was supposed to be a fun, relaxing weekend partying with our friends. Not fucking filming a stupid vlogumentary and settling your petty vendetta with Bryce. - [Andrew] Dude, shut up. - Oh no, what if he hears? What if he hears? Hey Bryce, Andy thinks you are a demon. And you've brought us all here to kill us. So would you mind bringing him back to reality, Bryce? Bryce? - Do you ever hear that voice in the back of your head? Hmm? That uncontrollable part of your conscience. Making decisions. Determining right, wrong. Good from evil. Poisoning your mind with thoughts of inadequacy and self-doubt? It started when I was 12. We were pranking this crazy old man when he snapped and dragged me inside. Andy was there. Filming the whole thing. Anything for the shot, right buddy? The old man tied me up. And told me he was giving me a gift that would set me free. That's when the voices began. At first they were helpful. Telling me what to do, what to say, to achieve anything I wanted. After awhile they got bored. Hungry for something new. Started telling me to do things to hurt myself. My friends. So I ran. Moved across the country. But they followed me. - So how'd you get them to stop? - Well that's just it, Tommy. I didn't. It turns out it takes a very special kind of person to receive a gift of that magnitude. Just ask Katie Perkins. Well, actually. Don't. Turns out she couldn't handle it. I guess you just can't give it to anyone these days. It was a big mess. You remember Katie, right? She had those bangs. (chuckles) Hey Joey? Let's get a shot of Andy's face. Yeah, right there. That's perfect for the vlogumentary. - Hate to break it to you, Bryce. My video just posted an hour ago, fuckface. Right, Joey? (tense music) Jo? - Oopsies! (Nikki, Bryce, and Joey laugh) - Look at his face! - Oh my God! "Game over, bitch." (Dew grunting) - [Dew] Told him it wouldn't fit. - Are you gonna cry? Is little Andy gonna cry? (Nikki, Bryce, and Joey laugh) - What is that? (liquid squishing) - Wait. Ew. What's that smell? - Oh shit. It's the sump pump. I told him it wouldn't all fit. (loud burst) (suspense music) - Oh my God! - Fuck this, dude! Run run run! (house rock music) What the hell, Tom? Look! - [Tom] Oh God! - Shit, dude. We gotta go! (demonic chanting) (screeching) Tom! Dude, there's no lock, dude! Grab something or something! - [Tom] I think I have a belt in here. Here here here. - [Andrew] Okay okay okay. Gotta put it on. - [Tom] I think I got it. - [Andrew] Got it? - [Tom] Yeah, it's in, dude. - [Andrew] Do you have your phone with you? - [Tom] No, Nikki has it. - [Andrew] Shit. Wait wait wait wait wait. You saw what I saw dude? Their fucking eyes, man. - [Tom] No I saw, I saw, man. Nikki had it too when we were, you know, making love. - Hello, hi! My friend Tom and I are being held against our will at our friend's cabin. Yes, 66 Bishop Place. Really? You sure? Okay, thank you. They said there's someone at our location already, dude. (floorboards creaking) - ["Pat"] Go for Pat, go for Pat. Officer Pat here. Walking through the house now. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just a bunch of kids having a wild party. I'll do another sweep before I leave. (loud knocking) Hello? You boys okay in there? (carrot crunching) Officer Pat to dispatch. Everything's all set here. Your friend called me to say you two took some drugs and weren't thinking clearly. - Why the fuck would they be here already, dude? - Oh God. The reflux is coming back. - [Dew] (demonic) You didn't take any of your buddy's melatonin did you? - Hi, yeah, this is Andy, I just called. Officer Pat is NOT here. Can you please send someone else? What are you doing? (phone smashes) What the fuck? - Oh God! (groaning) I think God is cursing me for having premarital sex. Either that or it's gonorrhea. (classy piano music) - Oh hi there. Brilliant Bryce here. The Amazing Andy's best buddy. We have a very special video for you today. But first, a word from our sponsors. - If you're like us, you have trouble cutting things out of your life. Luckily, we have just the thing. - I'm in the market. Look at all these options. What do you recommend for a woman like myself? - Well Jo, you're in luck. I've got the perfect tool for a strong independent woman like yourself. An elegant rusty knife. For those tough, hard to sever cuts. Perfect for removing ligaments or just some lighthearted stabbing. (Nikki and Joey laugh) (slicing) - Do you think the Ouija board did this, dude? - I don't care, man. We just need to get out of here. - Obviously, man, but if they came out of the board maybe we gotta put them back in. - This isn't Jumanji. Oh God. I think I'm gonna puke. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. - This may be bad timing, dude, but I want to apologize. For... For everything, man. I know I've been such a fucking asshole to you. - It's fine. It's fine, I should've listened to you about Bryce. - Dude, if we make it out of this thing I'm gonna shut the fucking channel down. I do not want to turn into Bryce, man. My life is just... Fine the way it is, you know? - Andrew. You're my best friend. But you're full of shit. (Andrew and Tom chuckles) (car pulling up) Someone's here. - Oh God. (tense music) (doorbell rings) - [Andrew] I can't tell, man. It's dark. - Good evening! Hello! Hi, I'm so sorry that I'm late, but I was... It doesn't matter, okay. Lord God, lamb of God, take away the sins of the world and have mercy... No, okay. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Halle ♪ ♪ Come to me in the name of the Lord ♪ - I feel like this isn't what you wanted. Is this not? Do you have a note for me, or maybe is it not convincing? I can do a liturgical dance. Like a tasteful... More prayer? - [Andrew] Oh shit, dude, it's Marlow the priest. - Call for help. - Help! Help! Help! (slicing) (Bryce laughs) - Woo! Smile! (slice) That's a wrap on the priest! - [Andrew] Fuck! What the fuck, dude? Tom! Run, dude, run! (suspense music) Go-go-go-go-go-go! Tom! Tom! - Goddammit! I told you boys a hundred times. (demonic voice) Stay out of my yard! - [Andrew] No! Not again! - [Tom] Save yourself! Nooooo! - [Andrew] Take that, you creepy old fuck! Tom! Come on, dude. - [Tom] Go, run! - [Andrew] Ha, you missed! - Next time I won't. (Tom groans) - I don't know how much further I can make it, Andy. Andy, your camera. - It's fine, dude. Come on, just a little further. - Okay. - Don't worry buddy, we're gonna find a place for you to lie down. It's gonna be fine. - [Tom] My insides are on fire. - [Andrew] Dude, shut up. They might hear us. - [Tom] Oh God, I need this out of me, dude. - [Andrew] You're gonna be fine, just- - (demonic voice) I need this out of me! - [Andrew] Holy shit! - You gotta tie me up. - [Andrew] Are you possessed, dude? - I don't know, man. - [Andrew] It was fucking Nikki wasn't it? Why'd it take you so much longer than everyone else? - (demonic voice) Because I'm such a GOOD little boy! (normal) Just grab the sheets, man, anything! - [Andrew] Fucking what about these? - Gross, fine, whatever! - [Andrew] Fine, hold still, dude. - Hold still. - Hurry! (demonic growling) - Okay, yeah. - (normal) Yeah, okay, these are tight enough at least. Okay. In my bag there's a bible. Get that. - You still carry your bible around? - Just get the fucking book, man! - Jesus, okay, man! Now what? - Okay. Open the yellow tab and read it. (demonic voice) No! Read the red one, bitch! (normal) Don't listen to him! Read the yellow tab. - Dude, a lot of these are bookmarked, man. - (demonic voice) Just read! - Okay! "In the name of Jesus Christ, our God and Lord." - (demonic voice) Burn! Burn your whore face! - "She followed Paul and the rest of us shouting "These men are servants of the Most High God "who are telling you the way to be saved." Is this helping? - (demonic voice) No, don't read another word you stupid little bitch! Come here so I can eat your skin! Nom nom nom nom nom! - Alright! "Paul, having been greatly annoyed with the spirit, "turned and said to the spirit I command you "in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." Fuck, that's it! I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of him! (demonic screams) Get out of my friend! (Demon screams) Wait, did that actually work? - (normal) I think so. Oh God. Yeah, the burning feeling's gone. Can you untie me? - Jesus dude, that was fucking insane! - Oh my God. - Why were you so much worse than everyone else? - Probably because I just (demonic voice) plucked my little flower now come here so I can pluck yours! - Don't judge a book by its cover. Nah, that's was bad, I'll go again. (static) Hey guys. I figured I'd do one last interview. In case things go wrong. I started this vlogumentary to understand why my friend Bryce Levy abandoned us. And now my friend is possessed by a demon. And actively trying to kill me. Joey has all the footage, so I have nothing to prove my case. I could run. And leave my friends behind. I've been very good at that. What's the point, dude? He's Bryce Levy, man. He gets whatever he wants, whenever he wants. And me, I'm a nobody. I'm a fucking nobody, dude, with nothing. Nothing, stuck sitting on the ground talking to no one. No. No, fuck that, dude. Fuck that! Not this time, man. Bryce Levy and I have been best friends since we were four years old, dude. Four! Diapers, man. Diapers. I know he's in there somewhere. And I'm gonna get him out. (glass shatters) - [Bryce] Andy! - All right, gang. In case this is the last you hear from me, this has been the Amazing Andy. Signing off. Like. And subscribe. Goddammit. - [Andrew] Bryce? You there buddy? Bryce! (tense music) (mouse squeaks) Holy shit! Fuck me, dude. (glass shatters) (thunder booming) Whoa! - I always loved doing my own stunts. - [Andrew] Dial it back, man. There's nobody even here to impress. (Nikki and Dew clapping) - Great landing, Bryce. - Great landing, Bryce. - [Andrew] What, were you just waiting outside for the perfect entrance? - We thought it would be cute for your little video. - [Andrew] Yeah, well my video will be fine enough without your help, dude. - Oh Andy. Can't even put the camera down for one second can you? - [Andrew] What are you doing, man? Give it back! - Oh, isn't that cute, guys. Andy thinks that he has a choice. - He doesn't. - He doesn't. - What an idiot. - What an idiot. - Oh, and you can put the glass down now. Won't be needing it anymore. (slicing) Come on, Andy. I'm just trying to help. You'll like things better this way. (thunder booming) (Bryce laughing) - Yeah, I doubt it. - [Bryce] Come on, Andy! (Andrew panting) - [Joey] Hi, Andrew. Isn't this awesome? I usually hate the shit we film, but you've really outdone yourself. - Why are you doing this? - [Joey] (demonic voice) Because you deserve it! - Joe. Can you hear me? I know you're in there somewhere. It's me Andy, Jo. (thunder booming) (glass shatters) - [Nikki & Dew] What are you running from, Andy? - [Nikki & Dew] We're just trying to help. - "The Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah. "And Jonah was in the belly of the fish "for three days and three nights." - (demonic laughing) The red tab! You read the red tab, you fool. You will be consumed by your ignorance. - Fuck. - (demonic roaring) "Paul, I command you in the name" "of Jesus Christ to come out-" - If only works If you believe it, sweetheart. (Bryce groans) - [Nikki] Bryce? - [Dew] Bryce? - I don't know. - [Nikki] Bryce what's wrong? - It burns! Oh my God! - Bryce. - Bryce. - What's wrong? Bryce! (Bryce screams) - It burns! It burns! It burns! (Bryce screams playfully) It's just a prank, Andy! (group laughs) - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Oh come on, Andy. When did you get so naive? Come on man, you used to be prepared for anything. A wet willy, a wedgie, or a crazy old man with a fondness for little boys. - Dude, we were both in on the prank, dude. It could've been either one of us. - But it wasn't. You got away. You got to live a normal life without a scratch on you. Isn't that right? (Andrew wails) Poor Andy still has to live with his parents. Poor Andy can't get anyone to watch his hilarious fart videos. Nothing's ever poor Andy's fault. The whole world must be out to get him. - I'm sorry. - [Bryce] What was that? - I'm sorry, okay? It was my fault what happened to you, dude. If I could go back and trade places with you I would, but I can't. - You would? Really? - Yes, yes I would. - Hmm. The Amazing Andy. Desperate for fame and recognition. A need to be seen. And he will do anything to get it. Do you see that camera, Andy? Hmm? Yeah? It sees you too. Shhh, easy. I'm not gonna hurt you, Andy. I'm giving you a gift. The chance to be the person you've already dreamed of being. (demonic voice) Me. Because you deserve it. (snaps) - Please. Please, Bryce. (tense eerie music) (demonic chanting) (demonic chanting) (music crescendos) (static) - Hey everyone. Brilliant Bryce here. It's been a while. But I promise the wait will be worth it. Andy spent his entire life hiding behind a camera. Trying to get noticed. Trying to be seen. Well Andy, welcome to the limelight. A life fully seen, but never noticed. Enjoy the ride. It's romantic and full of adventure. But when it's over, allow me to offer you one piece of advice. Find someone as desperate and pathetic as you to pass it on to. After all, it's a gift. And they deserve it. Just like you. (tense music) (door creaks) (door slams) (footsteps) - Did you leave the camera on? - I'm not an idiot, Tom. You ready? - [Tom] Yep. - Okay. (exhales) What's up everybody? It's the Amazing Andy, back at it again with another epic video. As always, remember to like and subscribe 'cause we're... (electronic rock music) - Now back to the show. (thunder booming) (electric whirring) (tense music) (distant wailing) I've been here before. (party music) - [Andrew] Somebody turned this shit off! (clears throat) All right, what up everybody? It's the Amazing Andy coming at you from LA. Los Angeles, California. West coast, baby, let's party! Yo, Tom! Tom come here, baby! Quit eating that fruit, what's good? Come on man, we're waiting for you. - Here we go, here we go. Thank you, Dew. Thank you thank you thank you. (snorting) - Woo! - [Andrew] Yeah! Come on, come on, share the love. - Get in there, get in there. - Share the love. - Come here come here. - Thank you. All right. Thank you, Dew. All right, here we go. (snorting) Fuck me! (laughs) - [Tom] (laughs) Hey, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy! - Yeah? - [Tom] Can you tell our viewers please why we're all celebrating here today? - Well I'd first like to thank all of our beautiful sponsors. They're the ones who made this all happen. And of course I want to thank our fans. You guys have made it possible. But I just want to say we're here because we just hit 10 million subscribers!

If you could go back to when we started Mean Spirited, would you change anything? - Andrew would. But the Amazing Andy? (demonic voice) Doesn't give a fuck!
