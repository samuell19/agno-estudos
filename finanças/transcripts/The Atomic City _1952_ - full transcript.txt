Get your clearance in the office. Anything wrong? Just a routine search. Say, what do these sets sell for? $173.50. Installed. Hmm. I guess I'll wait until they come down some. Yeah. That's the trouble with business. Everybody is waiting. I've got a television set delivery for a Dr Frank Addison. 1118 Rose Street. What's your name? John Pattiz. That's with a double T. Where were you born, Mr Pattiz? - New York. The Bronx. I will see if we have a pass and a file for you. I'm congressman Davenport. The manager is expecting me. Yes, sir. May I see your identification, sir? Sign this, please. Return that pass when you're leaving. Sure thing. Thanks. I'm Commander Rice. Have you some identification with you, Commander? - Certainly. Hi! Oh, hi. Lunch, Tommy. - In a minute, Mom. This is the newest new model, isn't it? - Yep. What are these two wires? One very near to the condenser. Those are .. uh .. Let's see. - They look like soldered connections. Ha? Oh yeah, sure. That's the latest thing. Don't handle them, Doc. The kick up a lot of voltage. Between 15 and 20 thousand volts. If they're connected. That's enough to kill a man twice over. No, sir. 20,000 volts won't kill you. It will just knock you against the wall or some place. Who says so? - My father. Well .. is your father an electrician? No sir. A physicist. Nuclear physics. Ah, sure. Hey. He's one of them bomb-makers? That's classified information. Nobody is allowed to give classified information. Tommy. The gentleman will excuse you while you have your lunch. I won't have time to help you. I'm going to the Fiesta with my teacher. My son doesn't care about anything today except the Santa Fe Fiesta prizes. Yeah, I know. My boss ad to donate one of them. He's giving one of those $17.95 portable radios. A two-wheeled bike is the best prize. - Come on, Tommy. I've got three chances to win something. Boy! I hope it's the bike. Hey, Doc. If you don't win the bike, just build one of your own. That's a swell idea. Chew your food, Tommy. - I am. How much do bicycle parts cost? You'd better ask Dad. He'll know. Mom. - Hmm? If I grow up, do you know what I'm going to do? It's when you grow up dear, not if. I'm going to build bicycles. Millions and millions of them. Finish up. Peggy will let herself in. My mother says to wait and see if your television set works before we buy one. After my father and I look it over it will work fine. Do you know what, Peggy? If I grow up .. I'm going to build bicycles. Millions and millions and millions of two-wheelers. Maybe I'll even build a few for girls. Hey, what was that? Just a routine morning test. - Routine? What a way to live. Bye, Mom. Don't forget your jacket. Now remember Tommy, only one cotton candy, and nothing else. Promise? I promise. Routine? Hey, Doc. Was that some of that nuclear .. Nuclear .. whatchamacallit? Nuclear physics? - Yeah. No. That's classified information. - Yeah. Hi, kids. Hi. - Hi, Russ. Well, how's the future newspaperman? Oh, I've given it up. I'm going to be a manufacturer. He says he's going to build bikes. Millions and millions of two-wheelers. For boys. Hey, that sounds big. Now there is your teacher. Hello Miss Haskell. Hi, Ellen. Hello Russ. You're a hero to take this battalion to Santa Fe. Oh, I like it. Will you be at the dance tonight? Where else? I've got to do a story on it for the paper. Oh ..? Maybe I'll squeeze in enough time to dance with me. Oh, thanks. You should see our new television set. It's nice, huh? - Yeah. Tommy, there is your father. Hi Dad, hi, Dad! Hiya Tommy. Be a good boy. Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning, fellahs. Good morning, Doctor. - Morning. Is Dr Schwambach here yet? - Yes, sir. There is that radium dial of yours again, Doctor. Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning, Mike. How's that boy of yours? - Fine, thank you. - Good. This great dance comes directly from the Hungarian czardas. No, no. From the English folk dances. No, from the cs?rd?s. Almost step for step, it is the same. Completely different. Not the same. Alright, alright. But it takes a man and a woman to demonstrate properly. Mrs Schwambach and I will show you tonight at the dance. Gus, I'm looking forward to it. Hello, Doctor. The neutron monitors have been checked, Dr Addison. "Adjust the cycloscope, please." "Let me have the neutron level up to 3R." All side checks, Doctor. "Doctor Schwambach." - "Yes?" "We're going to ease out the control rods." Alright children, this way. It's almost time for the puppet show and the prizes. Come on, we'll all go in together. Come on. Children, are we all ready for the big drawing? Yes! Alright, alright. Now our very good friend, Mrs Ostrich, will pick the first winner. Now the very first little lucky boy or girl. Is going to win this handsome chrome-finished ultra-modern bicycle. So kindly donated by the .. Acme Bicycle Sales and Record Shop, 28 San Pueblo Avenue. You may pick the first winner, Mrs Ostrich. 7-4-4-7-9 Thomas Addison. - Oh. Thomas Addison. Thomas Addison. Well, if Tommy Addison is not here, we'll hold his prize for next Saturday. And one week from today is the final day to claim the prize. Peggy, where is Tommy? I don't know, Miss Haskell. Wasn't he sitting next to you? Yes. When did he leave? Didn't you see him go? No, I was watching the puppets. Alright, now wait a minute, children. Now pick the next card, Mrs Ostrich. You're home early. - A little bit. Everything alright? - Sure. Fine. It's here, huh. I didn't know where you wanted to put it. There is a long cord. We can decide later. There is nothing on until five o'clock. Darling, there is something wrong. Gus Schwambach was burned. Over-exposed to radiation. - Oh, I'm sorry. How bad is it? They can't tell yet. Not for a few days. Frank. - Yeah? Why do we stay here? Now wait a minute, honey. I'm not that upset. Gus will be back in the Lab in a week or two. Don't you ever get tired of the barbed wire, Frank? Having an FBI man on your heels every time you step out of the main gate. And the signs. "Contaminated area. Restricted area." "Don't give classified information." "Don't talk to strangers." "Don't do this, don't do that." I diagnose this is a mild case of jitters. Brought on by an inattentive husband who ought to know to say hello to his wife. Ellen. Hello. What time are we due at the dance? - You want to go? Sure. Don't you? I think it's what we both need. I'll call for a sitter. You usually phone before this. Hey. What's boiling up inside of you, honey? If we're going to the dance, I'll have to get a sitter. It will keep. First let's find out about you. It's the first hint I've had that you didn't like living here. I didn't mean it to sound like that. You know I love our home, our friends. I've been proud of you getting to the top, all the recognition you've won. It's been wonderful for all of us. But what, honey? It can't be the barbed wire and the signs. Not after six years. What is it? - Nothing that makes sense. Well then .. talk nonsense, but tell me. Maybe we've been forgetting Tommy. He's spent all but one year of his life in Los Alamos. You make it sound like Siberia. What's wrong with living here? Good schools .. good climate. Good companionship. Everything a normal kid wants and needs. Are you sure, Frank? - Sure. I've been wondering whether living in this atmosphere .. Is a normal life for a child. There are four thousand kids living in town. They look normal enough to me. I don't know. When I was a child I used to say to my mother. "When I grow up, I'm going to be a nurse .." Or "when I grow up I'm going to be a doctor." It was always "when I grow up". Sure, all kids talk like that. Tommy doesn't. Tommy doesn't say "when". Today at lunch he said: "If I grow up". If he grows up. How normal is that? Darling, you're magnifying a slip of the tongue into something gigantic. It wasn't a slip of the tongue. Tommy doesn't talk about the future. Children in normal surroundings do. You did. I did. [ Doorbell ] I'll get it. Addison? Sign here, please. Thank you. Frank. Frank. Excuse me please. Where is the nearest telephone? Across the piazza, Se?orita. Thank you. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, Miss Haskell. Tommy should have told you he had to leave early. I picked him up outside the hotel. But Dr Addison, you had no right to do that. I ran all over the Fiesta looking for him. That was a horrible thing to do to me. Tommy deserves a paddling for not telling me. "I'm sorry." I'm to blame. "You certainly are. It was completely thoughtless of you." "I'm sorry." Tommy's ticket won the bicycle. Oh. Maybe we're happy he won. "Tell him he has one week to claim the bicycle." No, I can't tell him now. He .. He went to the store with his mother. "He'll have to present the ticket in the lobby of the La Gonda." Yes. "They keep the unclaimed prizes there." - Yes. "Remember, he must appear in person before the end of the week." I'll tell Tommy. Hey Frank, I heard your Tommy won the big prize this afternoon. Yeah, that's right. - Lucky kid. Now you're talking about one of the country's top physicists. You're talking to a teacher who stopped breathing this afternoon because of him. Excuse me if I look a little confused. It happened at the puppet show. Tommy just upped and left to meet his father outside the hotel. The least your top physicist might have done was to find out if Tommy had gone. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Hello? [ Spanish language ] Say Charlie, if Albert comes in, tell him to call his mother. May I, Martha? You know you can't monopolize your wife, Frank. Look Gregson, I'm just getting some air. Sure. - Alone. Doctor, we're outside Los Alamos. You know, I'm tired of having policemen at my heels each time I go out the gate. You've been aggravating the Doctor? Looks like it. All of a sudden, too. After going steady for so long. He's probably upset about Gus Schwambach. Will you be running a story on him? Just that he's been hurt. Nothing on how it happened. How do you like the newspaper business? I'm getting pretty good. You know, I worked undercover as a dishwasher once. Watch it. My mistake. Did Frank get to see Doc Schwambach in the hospital? Yeah. He was there most of the afternoon. Oh. Hiya Frank. Enjoying yourself? Yeah. How's Tommy? - Fine. I heard you had to paddle him this afternoon. No. No, I didn't. Hello? Hello? Excuse me. Yes. Hello. Please, hello. They hung up. They just asked my name and hung up. I hope nothing is wrong at home, Miss Addison. No, no. Everything is fine. You know, when me and my wife are out, we always worry about the kids. The telephone rings and .. we're scared. Watch it, darling. People are looking at us. Frank. Let's go home. Goodnight Mrs Addison, Doctor. - Goodnight, Gregson. They haven't hurt him. I have to call the police. No. You know what they want. I can't do it. - Don't! I won't let you, I won't let you. - There isn't any choice. There must be some other way. There has to be. Maybe they will take money. I wish they would. We'd raise it somewhere, somehow. But it isn't money, Martha. How can you be so sure? You don't know. Let me talk to them first, please Frank. Alright, darling. Alright. We'll wait and see what they ask. We'll wait and see. Just a minute. Excuse me, lady. Are you Mrs Addison? Yes. Yes, I am. Someone wants you on the telephone. Hello? "Is this Mrs Frank Addison?" - Yes, this is Mrs Addison. You know why I am calling? You want your son back safely, don't you? "I do, I do." Then tell your husband to play ball with us. Tell him he doesn't have to worry that we'll ever tell what he did. He'll do whatever you say. Now tell me, is Tommy alright? He's fine. We won't hurt him. Not if your husband follows instructions. Here, Tommy. Talk to your mother. "Hello, Mama. I'm alright, Mama." Tommy, darling. Mother will have you home soon, darling. You mustn't be afraid, dearest. "I'm not afraid, Mama." "I have been treated very good." "I can come home tomorrow after Daddy does what they want." He will, darling. He will. Tell them he will. You heard your son, Mrs Addison. Please can't I speak to him another minute? Just one more minute. There is no time for that. You'd better listen closely. "I won't repeat this. Get it right the first time." Yes. Please tell me what to do. Frank. Frank, he's safe. I spoke to him. - You spoke to Tommy? On the phone. The man let me speak with him. He wanted to prove he hadn't been hurt. They'll let him come home to us. Tommy said so. He said. "I can come home as soon as Daddy does what they want." Frank, the man promised no-one will ever know. No. No-one would. Not until they've wrecked half the world. I only know that Tommy is our world, Frank. Our whole world. Alright, Martha. I'll see what I can do. What were the instructions? [ Intercom: ] "Hello, Doctor. I didn't think you'd be in on Sunday." Bring me the Mark 3B file. All of it. It's in your office vault, Doctor. Thank you. I'll take that, Doctor. I'm Inspector Mann, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Russ. What is he doing here? A newspaper man. I stopped playing newspaper man this morning when I found Tommy was missing. That's the file he mentioned to the clerk, Inspector. Was this going to be the ransom payment, Doctor? Blind alley experiments we tried a year ago. Useless to anyone. Your son is kidnapped and you come to your lab on a Sunday. Just to pick up useless experiments? Look, Inspector. I was searching for some was to delay the threat to my son. I have only 48 hours to deliver the bomb. These are intricate equations. I thought if I sent them it would give me time to think, to act. To know what to do. It will take very skilled mathematicians several days to check these equations. And to discover they are useless. Well, if you're telling the truth, and that's a big "if" we're going to check. Then sending these useless equations may be the way we'll flush them out. Martha. This is Inspector Mann of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mrs Addison. You called them? You .. you called them. No. They found out I didn't go to Santa Fe for Tommy. No-one will know why we came here, Martha. Russ is a federal agent. Not a newspaper man. Get them out. Your husband said the kidnappers contacted you this morning, Mrs Addison. I won't answer their questions. Get them out! Darling, it has to be done their way. Their way! Give him time to calm her. I'm in a peculiar spot, Inspector. The Addisons have been close friends of mine for the past couple of years. That might help us. Is this a recent picture of the boy? Yes, very. Frank was telling the truth about that boy. I'd bet on it. He wouldn't sell out, not even for his own kid. You're not a father, Russ. I have two. Two little girls. I wouldn't like to have to decide between my kids and my country. How would you decide, Inspector? I don't know. That's why I don't know if you told the truth about this file. I don't know which way you decided. Pardon me, is this the letter? They contacted your wife through a pay-station phone? Yes. She spoke to a man and then to Tommy. I'd like to get the details from Mrs Addison as soon as possible. She'll answer all your questions if you just give her a little more time. You coming here was quite a shock to her. Yes, of course. You know, it's entirely possible Mrs Addison didn't talk to your son. It could have been a recording. You won't mention that to my wife. No. Did she say what instructions they gave her? Everything we have on the "H" bomb is to be delivered to a "William Masters". Care of the Will Call desk. Hotel Belfort, Hollywood. After they check, they promise to turn Tommy loose. They probably would. Rather than have it known they have the data. If figures that simply. They turn you into a traitor, and they have a pipeline into Los Alamos. They'd own the top scientist here. They won't get that chance. I guess I'm to be placed in custody. We can't put you in deep freeze without attracting attention. We can't afford that. You will be regarded as a calculated risk. You've got to try to see our job, Frank. The bomb means more than just one life. They said those same words to Martha. But to her, Tommy counts more than the millions. They are just numbers. Tommy is very real. Maybe I won't be a very good risk, Inspector. It might be wiser to place me in custody. If we have to, we will. Even you can't be permitted to get in the way of what has to be done. Our job is to keep the bomb at home and to apprehend the kidnappers. And to bring your son back safely. That's the order of their importance, isn't it. One, two, three. Tommy is number three. Yes Doctor, I'm afraid so. I want to emphasize one thing. We're dealing with top espionage agents. Who have resorted to kidnap. And we want them. And I mean every last one of them. That's a must. You are probably asking yourselves, what about the boy? Isn't getting Tommy Addison back safely more important? I'm giving you my answer to that officially. No. No matter how callous it seems, our first job is: locate and apprehend the spies. Russ Farley will give you your assignments. Connors, Weinberg and Summerton. Check the Santa Fe road. Maybe someone noticed the school bus being followed. Davis, you stick around the hotel lobby. Talk to the Chamber of Commerce people. The secretary, people around the hotel. We want to know who they are, what they eat for breakfast. Everything on them. Their families and friends. But remember, all of you. Don't panic people. They talk to friends when they're scared. By Tuesday the phony formula on the bomb will be at the hotel Belfort, Hollywood. We'll be needing some of you there. It's here. Okay to go ahead now? - Sure. This is position Harding. We're all set here. Position Melrose. Everything okay. Position Sunset. Okay. This is Junction. Position Harding again. Now keep those cameras ready. Let's have a routine check on all positions every half hour. If anyone looks vaguely familiar to you .. Yes, yes. I know. You've told us a dozen times. I remember when I see somebody from the puppet show .. I have to tap you on the shoulder. That's the idea. I'm sorry I snapped, Russ. It's just that I can't help feeling responsible for Tommy being kidnapped. You wasn't nothing to do with it. This wasn't planned overnight. If it hadn't happened Saturday, it would have happened some other time. The people we're dealing with know how to be patient and wait. Stop worrying about it. We'll get Tommy back. But first things first. Getting the spies is the important thing. It has to be that way. Here is position Harding. "It's one-thirty. Let's have another check." Okay at Sunset. Morning. May I have seven 2-cent stamps please. Yes indeed. There you are. - Thank you. Are you holding a letter here for me? William Masters. Masters? [ Buzzer ] Say, when would it have arrived? Yesterday? A few days ago? - No, today. This morning's mail. Oh. This morning. Let's see .. Masters .. Masters .. All positions. This is the pickup. Man of medium build, about 25. A black and white check suit and no hat. I'll be right behind him to identify him. Oh yes, here we are. William Masters. Thank you. You're welcome. There he is. Know him? No. He's headed your way, Melrose. - "We have him." This is Junction. Pick me up now in front of the hotel. Take care of Miss Haskell and Peggy, Larry. - Alright. This is Harding to Sunset. Check this license number. California 1 - N for Nora. 5 8 0 6 4. "1 - No for Nora." "5 8 0 6 4." "Checking immediately." We're on Beverley Boulevard, due west now. We're leaving him. Take over, Junction. Junction to Harding. We're with him. "This is Sunset." "License plates were issued to David Rogers." "Police headquarters says he has a record." "Petty larceny arrests." "Their description fits this man." A messenger boy. He could be heading for the ball park. That's where he's going. We're staying close. "This is White." "Inspector Mann will be at the television booth." Are you in charge here? - Yes. Can this be kinescoped? It can, but it's just a local show. How many cameras have you? Well, we've got two down on the field and this one with a zoom lens. This is the one we want. Can it be kinescoped without going out to the public? Sure. But I don't have authority to .. - Who has? The station manager. Call him. This is a government emergency. Well, okay. There, that's the man I want there, with the check suit. Going into the box behind 3rd base. See if you can get that man in the check suit going into the 3rd base box. Right there. You got him? Yes, sir. Get me the boss, quick. His car has been searched. He still has the letter on him. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Any seats available in this section? No, I'm not allowed to give out free box seats. Cops usually go round to the front office if they want free seats. Let's go there. I want to get you the afternoon off. His uniform ought to fit you, Smitty. Go! Go! He made it. He made it! He made it, yes. Junction to all positions. Junction to all positions. He's ready to leave. It isn't on him. Then he passed it. He had to. That's why they got rid of him. - Maybe the movies we took .. Yeah. Smitty, you take over. Russ, we get a plane for Washington. How long does it take them to get the projection room ready? It's almost four days since they took Tommy. Well it will still take them some time to break down the formula we sent them. I hope so. - We all do. Wishful thinking is even part of our business. [ Door knocks ] Sorry about the delay, gentlemen. We're about ready now. - How many will look at the film? Every undercover party member we could reach on such short notice. Thirty or so. And .. Harold. No bright lights are to go on in the projection room at any time. It's set up so the identities of our undercover agents will remain unknown. Even to each other. Is that you, Harold? Yes, Farley is with me. - Over here at the light. Watch yourselves coming across. Now, those of you who haven't attended one of these sessions before. Listen to these instructions, please. Just at your right in each booth, is a panel with a switch and three buttons. These buttons permit each of you to start or stop the film .. To back it up or get it going forward again. If any of you recognise someone even vaguely familiar .. Press the "stop" button. Are there any questions? Then let's start. This is the man used for the pickup. Watch the hands and faces of the people he meets or passes. Don't hesitate even at the slightest doubt. To stop the machine or run it backwards. This is the ball park now. And you will have to try to pick out faces from among hundreds. Notice that he had a reserved seat. Our check shows it was bought at the box office on the day the boy was kidnapped. How much of it have we seen? Roughly, six thousand feet. About half of what we shot. What is it? - I thought I saw something. I'm backing it up. That vendor. We were party members together in Illinois. That's right. I knew him in Detroit. Well, what have you got on him now? - Nothing. Lost track of him in Chicago two years ago. He called himself Manfred Rhinerton then. He used the name Charles Morgan before that. He was Pete Ronson in Detroit. Did you get those names? - Yes. That badge number. What is it? Seventy-two. [ Doorbell ] I'll get it, Martha. Come in, Greg. We got a good lead, Doctor. There is a plane waiting to take us to Los Angeles. They've picked up a man who may know where Tommy was taken. I'll get Mrs Addison right away. - No, Doctor. I'm only supposed to bring you. Oh? What is it, Frank? I'll be right there, dear. I'll just take a minute to tell her. - Doc. Do yourself and your wife a favor, will you. Don't build this up too high. It's better to wait and see how good it cooks. You're right. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll be right with you. "So, I sold hot-dogs for one day." "Hey, why not you cut a record on this? I wouldn't have to repeat so often." "My name is Donald Clark." "Arrested twice. Ann Arbor. Inciting a riot. Served ten days." In here, gentlemen. Hello, Frank. - Have you found ..? Not yet. Been at him for hours. He's a very definite lead, though. Take a look at him. It's a one-way glass. He can't see or hear you. Did you ever see him before? Never. I'll tell the Inspector you're here. Donald Clark, age thirty-three. Are you the night shift? Somebody might lose his temper and slap you into the middle of next Monday. Easy, Russ. Yeah. That's not very democratic talk. You remember what they taught you in Washington? Your book of regulations says, and I quote: "No prisoner will be subject to physical punishment by any member of The Bureau." "Or in the presence of any member of The Bureau." When you're walking that last mile, you can recite all the book of regulations. Dr Addison is outside. Doctor Addison .. - Doesn't know him. How is Martha? It's over five days since they took Tommy. They haven't hurt him. Not while they think you've done business with them. They still need time to break down that phony data don't they? Another day or two, more or less. I don't know. I'm not sure. Nobody can be. How about a break for a sandwich and coffee? I'll stand by with Frank. Alright. If you change your mind, just tell the hall guard you're joining us downstairs. That man in there. Does he know where Tommy is? Probably. At least he knows where the letter went. Then make him tell. We'll keep at him. But he knows the ropes too well. We can't beat it out of him. - No? You can't either. I can't let you, Frank. I didn't write the Bureau's book of rules. Rules, rules? Who cares about your rules? I care about Tommy. So do I. We can't do it. It's against everything we stand for. He'll talk, Frank. It's a question of time. Time? How much time do you think Tommy has? "Yes?" - Give me long distance. I want to call Los Alamos. "Who is speaking, please?" Frank Addison. - "Sorry sir. This line is restricted." "You can't call long distance." Why can't I? I'll pay for it. - "I'm sorry, sir." "It's government regulations. You will have to get official permission." Farley. "Russ, can you come to the Tech Lab right away?" "We need a check." Okay, I'll be right there. I'm Frank Addison. Where is he? Now, now .. - Where is he? No .. wait! Where is Dr Addison? Inside. Alone? Santa Fe. The letter went to Santa Fe. Frank, you shouldn't have. - Russ. Did you have anything to do with this? - I'm responsible. Russ wasn't here. You haven't any right to take .. - More right than he had to take my son! I'd have beaten him to death if I'd had to. I'll have to report this. You said the letter went to Santa Fe. Where in Santa Fe? Nineteen, El Bado Street. A Robert Kalnick, a physicist. Know anything about this Kalnick? - Only by reputation. Well known abroad. How soon can we get to Santa Fe? - We can be there by daybreak. Inspector. Just a minute. Inspector Mann. Get me the airport. Inspector, my wife. When I left, I couldn't say much. George, get him patched up. Would it be possible to have her meet us in Santa Fe? It would give her something to cling to. Some hope. Russ, okay the Doctor for a long-distance call. - Right. Have your wife meet us at the airport. Inspector Mann. Okay, put him on. Where is it? - Second house around the corner. There is a street construction man standing by. Reardon, Jones. Take three men, cover the front and the back. The rest of you come with me. Check the window. Not yet, Doctor. Wait until they have things under control. Inspector. They proved the formula was fake. No .. darling. Oh, please. Come on, honey. Oh .. morning, Officer. Morning, folks. This gentleman is a Forest Ranger, Marion. Are we trespassing, Officer? No. But the ruins are closed to the public. Well, I just thought we'd take a look at a couple of your caves. You know, get an idea of how folks used to live. Sorry, but it's not safe. Too many cave-ins and slides. We wouldn't want you folks to get hurt. You're absolutely right, Officer. Come on, Morty. If we hurry, we can have lunch in Santa Fe. Anything happen this morning? Just tourists .. all the way from Pennsylvania. They kept on calling me "Mr Forest Ranger". Very unhappy they couldn't see the Puy? Ruins. This eating out of cans is killing me. I know. It gives you indigestion. You been a good boy? Yes, sir. Want me to take care of your lunch? Yes, sir. You'll be going home soon. Maybe in a day or two. Yes, sir. What are you going to tell your parents? I was treated very good. What else? You will keep in touch with my father. What are you doing? Nothing, sir. You know better than to try digging your way out of here. Yes, sir. Do you know what would happen if we caught you outside? Yes, sir. Would you like that? - No, sir. Just keep thinking about that. Want a drink? - No thank you. [ Car horn ] You behave yourself now. What's wrong? The letter was a plant. They're stalling for time. - Who? I'll not wait to find out. There is no sense in Dr Rassett and myself making the rest of the climb. Get rid of everything traceable after you finish with him. You want him left inside the Pueblo? - That's immaterial. It will save time. We can seal up the entrance with rocks. Alright. We'll wait a bit. They've outlived their usefulness. I don't think they would talk. That's a rather theoretical conclusion. Perhaps they won't talk. But I prefer to make certain. Say Arnie, the kid's gone! Where? How? Never mind that. Get after him. [ Whistle noise ] Something is wrong. He got out through the chimney. Alright, we'll find him. We've got to find him. He can identify us. Let's not behave like chickens with our heads off. He's the headless chicken. Not us. There is no other way off the mesa. Dr Rassett will stay here. We'll flush him out. Help! Help! Help! I can't get through. We'll have to burn him out. And have the smoke bring the forest rangers? Take a look around outside and see if there is another exit. Give me that light. Tommy. Listen to me, Tommy. You'd better come out. Come on out. Well, we're going to wait right here until you change your mind. You might die of thirst. You'd better come out. There is snakes in there. They live in those rocks. Come on out. I won't. Never! You can't make me. Close up the opening with a lot of rocks. It won't take long. Alright, get started. Oh boy! Oh boy, I won the bike, I won the bike. Pop, Pop! I won the bike, I won the bike. Sidney, what are you talking about? - I found this ticket. There is the winning number. Let me see that ticket. - Just a minute. My son found that. We're certainly entitled to find out if he won .. Oh. Where did you find this ticket, sonny? It's mine. Sidney, tell the man where you found it. I found it at the back of the caves. The caves? - Oh, the Puy? ruins. Yes we were there just an hour ago. - Puy?. You and your son wait here a moment. "Inspector Mann, please. Come in." This is Mann. Over. "Wilson speaking." "Davis picked up some people with the Tommy Addison contest ticket stub." "They found it about an hour ago at the foot of the Puy? cliff dwellings." "Repeat: Puy? Cliff dwellings." Puy? cliff dwellings. And hurry. There might be an exit, but it wouldn't help him. There's a sheer drop all the way down to the road. I've got some rocks out of the mouth of the cave. Give me a hand. This is the boy that found the ticket. Search the caves. All of them. Here is the air search. This is Helicopter. I've spotted a man on the mesa. Hold him until we get up there. No shooting. We need him. All men to the top of the mesa. All men to the top of the mesa. "Farley to Helicopter." This is Helicopter, over. "Take the wooded area, Bob. Look for three men." "Two dressed as rangers. The other wearing civvies." "They went after the boy." "We're starting into the woods now." Better wait here, Mrs Addison. Close to the radio. Russ! Russ. Inspector. Check him out. Farley to Helicopter. Anything in sight? - Nothing. You'll be coming out soon on the edge of the mesa. Nothing yet. Farley, I spotted your two rangers. They ran in to a cave right below me. I'll circle back and point it out to you. Got it Bowen. Go ahead. The helicopter. I think it spotted us. Alright men, follow me. Hurry. You inside. This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Come out this way .. slowly. With your hands up. You have thirty seconds. No. They want us alive only to answer questions. Questions we can't answer. I want to stay alive every minute I can. Me too? We're coming out. Don't shoot. Where is the boy? - In there. Take him out! Now we need something to break through. I'll put in a call. Tommy .. Tommy! Tommy. Tommy. Bowen. This is Farley. We need pickaxes and crowbars to open up a side cave. "How long will it take the helicopter to make the round trip?" About twenty minutes. Wilson. Have everything ready for the helicopter. They have the boy buried in one of the side caves. We can't tell if he's alive. He hasn't answered our call. Helicopter to mesa. Hurry. Come in, come in. Go ahead, Bowen. "The boy is out on a ledge below the mesa. He's hanging out in space." "I'm right above him." "Get there fast. He can't hang on very long." Stay with him Bowen. We'll be right there. We can drive around there. Inspector .. Bowen sees the boy. Right Davis, you can tie a rope to the tree there. - Alright. Sorry Doctor, we can't risk losing you. I can't let you. - But .. Even if I have to use force you're not going over. Farley will get the boy. Tommy! Give me some slack. Tommy, this is Dad! Tommy, this is Dad. Tommy. Tommy, this is Dad. No, don't look up, son. Stay there quietly, very quietly. Hang on, Tommy. Hang on! Don't let go, Tommy. Russ will get you. I'll be right over there in a minute, Tommy. Hang on. Just as few seconds more, Tommy. Hang on, don't slip. They're going to make it. They're going to make it. You're safe. Dad. Mummy, Mummy, Mummy! Hi Mom. I wasn't scared. We were, Tommy. * steve d *
