everyday existence provokes manifestations, often violent: they hit, bite, scratch themselves, stick their fingers in their eyes, pull their hair... all of the most important functions can be disturbed... We must assume that these children came into the world with an innate incapacity to establish a relationship with the other, just as other children come into the world with innate physical or intellectual handicaps... Their hearing and intellectual capacities are virtually normal... That is what psychiatry says, about those children there, of which there are many and about this one, in particular, which is not to say personally. I, professor and doctor XX at the hospital hereby certify that the child XX, born on August 24/19XX, remained under observation at the Children's Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic, on September 10, 19XX. This is a severe case of encephalopathy presenting obvious psychotic traits. Considering his agitation and distractedness, his IQ is practically impossible to evaluate. To the parents, one word was said: "Incurable" That is all the psychiatrist can say, endeavoring to say, as truthfully as possible, what he sees and what he knows. So he was 12 years old, in 1967. Unbearable, it is true, ...the neighbors... because of everything one can say because of everything that can be said, and then... Nothing to do. They stated it clearly: "Incurable" "Insupportable" "Unbearable" "Incurable..." Unbearable, so society has everything planned. Even places where being unbearble would be planned for... And it just so happens that this place, where everything is planned for, I know it. The walls are walls, the roofs are roofs, there are trees... And the windows are not exactly... real windows. The windows do not open. There are no hinges. Iron embedded in wood. The grill cannot be seen So, what will become of the eyes, of this child here, amongst hundreds of others? What will become of the eyes of a child who has nothing to see except the passing of time and time - it cannot be seen. This child here is affected by early onset autism. So, "his isolation is extreme", says psychiatry. and what it says is true the symptoms is flagrant and since it's immutability that he needs, he will have it, as much as he wants: immobility, reiteration, and ever-sameness. This photo, this image, was taken here. Far away from those planned places, built for purpose. Far away, at the opposite pole It's at this opposite pole that we find ourselves. And we have just arrived here, with that kid there who is the key to our existences. What he holds in his hand, what he contemplates, is a small ball of clay tied to a piece of string. One of us must have kneaded it with our palms and tied it there, to a branch. and so it began That kid there was going to make us see that perhaps the Earth wasn't turning in the right way. This kid, here, born with an innate incapacity to establish a relationship with the other and suffering from an imperious need of immutablity. THAT KID, THERE RAFTS ON THE MOUNTAINS "It's about finding a path that's why we make maps, tirelessly for the seven years that this attempt has persisted "...It's not about going towards them, taking care of them, addressing them, that is not our way..." "...Our language is a gridlock to these children who have no use of language..." [Deligny sequence, A1, The First]. Action. To speak... as if it were completely natural To speak about this kid here and the others that resemble him even though we were doing everything to go without language without this famous language that makes us what we are. And now, we must account for ourselves to him Mute, that kid there So, what can we rely on what to rely on, when it fails: language. We started to trace That kid there, who does not speak, traces, for months on end. His hand traced circles, circles, and nothing more. It's still tracing them. We started to trace, our hands following the trace, of what our eyes were seeing, our eyes, what our gaze was able to see, to capture, to bring us. And so, here are the routes of this kid during a day in September 1967. He turns. He turns... either around himself, hands behind his back, one hand holding the other, or he turns around running, as if one were at the center of a carousel, holding on by the reins. There's a saying that a kid takes a turn for the worse. He, he would turn ceaselessly around himself That's what language makes us say: He turns around himself. But if this famous "himself" is, in reality, absent, vacant, then this kid turns around nothing, on nothing, frantically, lost. Could it be that he is searching for it, this self of his? That he's searching for himself? We haven't taken that path This kid here was turning, neither right nor wrong, beyond that, beyond good and evil, which are matters of speech. Never the shadow of a smile on his face, his mother told me, he never opened his arms, never the shadow of the other in his field of vision. What I said to myself, what I said and said again, tirelessly immutably, to us, to this us, there, what I said and went on about: It's us he's searching for. And us: we were there, close, attentive, astonished, concerned, moved. There, in this vast dwelling, between the teeth of these two rocks, we, thinking beings, beings of language, of flesh, of blood, of bones, and of language, above all else. If not, what else can you trust? But, seeing as language does not hold, because he does not have it, this kid here, who hears nothing, so, the difference is enormous. The distance, infinite. Unlivable, that kid there. Unbearable. Incurable. And us, in his eyes, invisible, nonexistent. During all those months, he was turning and turning, he spun like a flock of pigeons in flight. And the earth and the rooftops seemed to disappear So, the flight wouldn't stop its circling. In fact, all those months, that kid was not walking, he ran, heels never touching the ground. Incessantly. Indefatigably. It's not normal to be indefatigable The wolf's trot. The wild child. Besides, he barked. A hoarse bark. An ?oww?! Who knows how to write this. And he also happened to hit his head against a wall... violently. Other children came to us, resembling him, in certain traces, in certain ways of being, making us believe that this language on holiday makes them, these children, twins. And so we took position. We were always just a few, scattered into small units, in the hills around here. We had to hold out, day and night, despite the unlivable, the, unbearable. Riding the waves, over the eroded hills, of the hercynian orogeny, were a few rafts. A few rafts after the disaster. Disaster... language disappeared, like one might say about the sun. And us, to tell the truth, we were lost at sea, yet tenacious. In the end, they would sense that we were there... close... Us: of flesh, of blood, and of bones. And perhaps of something other than language. He's scared. Then again, he goes sledding all by himself. Could it be the steepness? No, he's not afraid of the steepness. Isn't it because of the looks? - Isn't it because of the others? - No, no. When he goes sledding, he rides alone, or with the others, it's not that... It's the fact of him standing on something unstable... But on a sledge? Off he goes! - Right away... - We'll see. - Well, let's go to work. - Bye. Let's go All that I can say... that I must say is that, we really never tried to know what THEY had, what THEY were affected by. We began researching what we might lack, what we felt to be missing in us, and gravely so, to the point that this 'us', here - conjugated people - could be, in their eyes, nonexistent. Nonexistent, but, perhaps, not entirely. From far away, very far away, even when the child was close, it happened that he could vaguely distinguish something. Something that had nothing to do with one nor the other. A year, more or less to the day, that he has been here with us, this kid, with the clay ball, profoundly encephalopathic. To turn and this sway. It's almost like the movement of a clock. The wheel... and the anchor. Black flowers, here and there, on the wander line, there, where he would stop running... and that sway would sometimes be of a shorter range. Here it is like a cry and there it's a murmur. But it is not at all about language. It is about this swaying, hands behind his back, one holding the other. All these black flowers are swayings. Sometimes, in an almost imperceptible way, but swayings all the same. The flowers are never entirely still. And there, he vibrates right to the core, like a magic wand. WATER Spring, river, pool, well. Every water source, located, vibrated. Our routes are in white The desert... or nearly. Nearly There's one little net of wander lines that passes through and... do you see the old place up there? The wander line goes up as far as there. Who knows the reason for this persistent return to the old place. Sometimes one or other of us would accompany that kid there up into the water. He wouldn't go in. He watched. And then we thought: since there was no other for him, how could we make ourselves water in his eyes? July 1969. Something must have happened up there. The clockwork movement goes on, immutable. Turning round in circles, and this swaying. The wheel and the anchor. But... the wander line it takes our ROUTES, that are all irrigated by it. Is that to say that this kid here takes part in our PROJECTS? That 'good for nothing' he was, look how he became an extraordinary machine that does everything. Definitely, without language, there is no end. The blatant truth that may prevent us from seeing that language may have its own ends. And as for us, language doesn?t give much of a damn, neither more nor less than this kid here. One of us went to live in a hollow, 300 meters from the hamlet. Robinson, on his Island down below, on his hollow island, provided with a few unusual man Fridays: unlivable, unbearable, incurable. A little stream, a tent, a shelter. The four walls with no roof of a long since abandoned sheepfold. Without a roof. Without you or me, these kids there. And the wander line goes there... and comes back, leaving again. It dwells... and leaves again. And there it is, in this house where we are. Water - in this house there isn't any. It?s that kid there that brings it, brings it to us. This us here, I might add. It has this effect on us: that he brings it to us, the water, Indefatigably... Water, water carried from the spring to the stone sink. Indefatigably, to say the least. There was some kind of enthusiasm in the effort of carrying the water. And why not? The days were all alike and dotted with bursts of joy. Joy, it bursts. And pieces of it would fall everywhere, between us, at any moment. If you have put white... If it?s white you put here, is it because there is... Something... Something that is spotted there... That is of the same nature as the white circle? The island down below. I mean, all the kids? routes, to the left, to the right, would circulate... and their routes would never cross over - And could it be a... - something like that...? - No, I don?t think. - No? Well, never mind. Well, we will find it somewhere. The island down below - summer 1969 In white lines, the customary routes of this "us-others", in this place here. The objects that are surely perceived by the child living here are traced with black ink, called India ink. The little starry dots mark that which attracts him, elements of the enacted project, going towards... ?WE? aren?t represented in person. - So you changed to grey... - At the Serret there is this old stone for... There is no object that is put on it. Well, now there's a club, and we tap with it... - That's it. - That replaces the rock, well that... there?s a club.... - And on top of those stones there... - Yes? Before, there was a bowl... the saw, or the axe... There, let's say, a lunchbox or a bag of potatoes. So, on these stones, is placed in advance - what is going to happen. - What is going to happen. And when we get them, we also go by the stone, hitting it with the club. WE ARE IN THE MEADOW By dint of tracing the wander lines of every child there, we managed to see a little of that which doesn't concern us. I mean to say, that which we struggle to see from our blind perspective of speech. We... It grew in him like a body, traced in grey, almost as black as the water. By dint of being there, no doubt... and to go and to come. The turning around disappeared, absorbed by the making... All this grey is our own habits... our projects and our day-to-day routines. The wander line gets fatter THERE, with our own habits. Here and there, the small black flowers of the ?for nothing? persist. Some of us must have thought they were weeds, these ?for nothings? there, and softly uprooted them, these seeds of the symptom. There is almost nothing left, on this tracing here. One must look for them. Could it be that he has been - that kid with the clay ball - mobilized to such a degree... domesticated, who knows what word one could even think of when everything goes so well. And it was necessary to trace maps. And this, in spite of everything, in spite of the lack of time, and the fatigue, and everything that prevents seeing that which doesn't concern us. The black flowers disappeared, or perhaps they were no longer perceived by any of us who traced. They didn't concern us anymore, those black flowers. the kid was one of us. Everything that prevents us from seeing what does not concern us, I mean, that which escapes language, to which we are slaves, more or less astute, more or less subtle. We have good reasons to not see while reason itself blinds us with its light, with its lights, which is not an excuse to nickname him 'incurable' this kid here. What a nickname! And hard to bear! Language still fails... The bridge is still broken. We crossed at the ford. What is needed? Some stones, a stone, this stone, there, inscribed, transcribed. We can?t say, after all, that it came out of our body, and yet, I say that this thing is a coordinate of this common body. How else to say it? It?s not about one or the other. It?s actually about a kind of ?us?. But an ?us? that has nothing to do with the conjugation of the people that are present here. Sure, we needed to understand each other, to devise, even without believing too much. But it was always unbeknownst to us that the kid would break open the obvious truth: that he would find us there. And these "theres" of his were quite peculiar. That?s how this stone was born, this stone that allows... initiatives, in abundance... Like when you hit a stone - sometimes it make sparks. A stone and a die. By the presence of kids who have no history, we start history over again, unceasingly... from zero. Once upon a time, there were men and stones. They kept themselves close to water sources and didn?t know why. Water is something that does not exhaust the function of: "to drink". And the stones, they were there as well. And the: "for sitting", ?for cracking nuts", ?for building walls?, ?for marking boundaries? doesn't exhaust them. And that kid there: "unlivable", "unbearable", "incurable", takes initiatives, fascinated, attracted as he is, by the things to be done. A stone of us on the wander line. [Initiative.] You know it's still there, the clockwork motion. Turning round, that "swaying" and this little character that inscribes the event of the initiative is made of a circle and a stick. The dot of the "I". The "I" of initiative. The "I" of immutable. He throws the die and off he goes - to do. But in a world in which language reigns, will he ever have freedom? The question remains if we have it, us beings of the verb. And who knows what he can hear, which voices, which are not voices, but which speak about the time when human beings were neither one nor the other, discriminated by language. He listens, no animal listens like that... for nothing. The noise that comes from the depths of the water, which is not a thing, because he is not a someone. Subtitles: e.g. splinter
