COLLIN: Hey, Derek! Hey, Derek! Let's go! Morning, bro. How's it going? I like the Huey Lewis look. Yeah? Really? Really. Yeah, I think you're right. Thanks, bro. Hey, don't mention it. Morning, Maria. Everybody gone already? Your father left very early this morning. Before 6:00. Probably had a golf game. Where'd my mom go? Did she say? A meeting, I think. A breakfast. The Pink Roses Club? No, I don't think so. Okay. The Ballet Auxiliary? Maybe. Morning. Hey, did you hear about the Mission Saturday night? What about it? Thirteen cars got ripped off. Thirteen cars? Not the cars, just the radios. They had a concert up there. I think Mom and Dad went. Cops know anything about it? Ethnic minorities. MARIA: What, Willie? White boys don't steal? GIRL: Hi, Derek! BOY: Hey, Derek! How's it going? Kid. Hi.How you doing? Good. How are you? I'm okay. I missed you yesterday. So maybe tonight, huh? I gotta work. You may be blowing a major opportunity here. I'm off tomorrow night. All right. Why would anybody ever pick these colors? Hi, Victor. Hi, Christie. What is it with you and that guy? Nothing. He's just quiet, that's all. "Quiet"? Derek, he's a nice guy. I gotta go. Bye. Bye. See you at lunch, beautiful! The secretary will read the minutes from the last session of the council. How about we just dispense with minutes? We've got important things to talk about. Such as? Such as the complete breakdown of law and order at this school. ALL: Yeah. As witnessed by the condition of my locker this morning. BOY: Everybody's locker. They broke into Sinclair's locker and stole his... Might I point out the parliamentary procedure is still in effect here, ladies and gentlemen. Point of order, Mr. Pres. How about a little parliamentary procedure out there, where it counts? Yeah, you got it. Law of the jungle out there. Yeah, come on, Barnwell. Let's get down to it. I'd like to go on record, Julie. There will never be a return to law and order until... spray paint is abolished from this earth. Well, it's not that big a deal. But we are being ripped off left and right. I mean, pretty soon you're gonna have to carry your lunch around in a safety deposit box. Does the distinguished senior class representative wanna make a motion? No. Just ticks me off, that's all. Yeah, I second that emotion. Second that, what? That emotion. Amen, brother. You know how many times me or one of my boys has been out here in the last couple of months, Bob? Nine. Yeah, for vandalism. Right, nine. And a dozens times for fights and theft, and close to 40 times for drugs. You clocking the mileage, Wes? Is that what you're doing? You gotta help us, Bob. You help us, we help you. Do you have any idea how much this little party last night is gonna cost? Estimates haven't come in yet. You know that ad... "Pay us now or pay us later"? You've been doing it your way for three years now, it's time to try ours. Forget it, Wes. Now, look. The taxpayers are tired of reaching into their pockets over and over again to pick up the pieces, to sweep up the glass. To repaint this, to rebuild that. This place was like a country club when it started. Another year of this, it's gonna look like all the rest. I know you're trying to help, Wes, but I'm an educator. I can't allow this school to be turned into an armed camp. Oh, come on, Bob. A few undercover cops is not an armed camp. The problems we have are no different than the problems facing a lot of schools in this country. I'll deal with it my way. If this keeps up, pretty soon you're gonna have to do it my way. So... what's a pretty girl like you doing working in a crummy joint like this? Suckering guys like you into paying 15 cents more a gallon at a full service pump. DEREK: TRing, tring! Work time officially declared over! Coffee break! Where's the gang? Oh! Need I say more? DEREK: We are your official rest period. CHRISTIE: You are honey. DEREK: We are going to commandeer the whole situation. CHRISTIE: Take me, I'm yours. What's this? Hey, hombres. What you do? This is where we live. Clear out, Mule. Don't be messing in my business. COLLIN: What'd they do? I said, beat it, didn't I? They didn't do anything. I say these be the boys that stole those radios Saturday night. Who wants to bet? Yeah? Hey, listen up. You break into my car, I'm gonna rent a helicopter to take you up 3,000 feet and drop you out like a sack of sewage. Comprende? Mule, what's the matter with you? You see a couple of Chicanos and you think they're guilty of something. Now, beat it, all of you. Now! Well, they're in a police car. Yeah, they're nice guys. What time are you off? I'm off at eight o'clock.I'll be here at 8:01. Look, I wanna get cleaned up first. Look at that. Okay, make it 8:02. Oh... Now, when do I get to eat dinner? I'll buy you dinner. You will, huh? Let me guess. Uh... Italian. Whatever you want. Mm-hmm. Delmonico's? Ah. Impeccable taste. Yes. In men, too. Eight thirty? Eight thirty two. Okay. Why does he do that?I don't know. He's an animal. He's a mule. I'll see you later.Okay. You are the light of my life and I can't live without you. You know that. You doll, you. Pepperoni, mushrooms and extra cheese. See you Saturday, Christie. Okay. Saturday? Yeah, I got a new job. I start waitressing here in a few days. What about the gas station? It's only three afternoons a week. It's just not enough. Well, you know, not enough for you, but too much for me. Well, my father doesn't own a car dealership, Derek, and not everybody in this town can live in a five-bedroom house on Bluffside Drive. We're never gonna have any time. Yes, we will. I'll make time. Hi. Hi. Sorry. Since when has he been working here? I don't know. A couple of weeks, I think. Is that what gave you the idea? Money gave me the idea, Derek. Some of us need it, some of us don't. Well, let's get fat. BOY 1: Hey, come on, Ramundi. Since when is a dime bag 20 bucks, huh? BOY 2: 20 bucks! BOY 3: Hurry, Jerry, I gotta get going. BOY 1: Here, I'll take that. Give me some dust then. Good morning. Thank you all for coming. You people are among the best and the brightest in the state, so I'm sure you can stand to miss a class. Some of you probably know or may have guessed why I've asked to speak to you this morning. Last weekend's incident was an insult to us all. This is your school. So, what do we do about it, young people? What can we do? Do we just roll over like so many other schools have done across this nation? ALL: No! Do we just throw up our hands and say, "You've won"? ALL: No! "Take it, it's yours. Take our school." No. Do we call in the troops, the police? Do we cut into our sports budget to hire private security guards and do we give them our school? No! Do we put locks on every door, do we put undercover cops on campus? No. Well, I feel the same way you do. And I'm damn proud of it. So... it's up to us, isn't it? It's all up to us. Just let us at 'em, Mr. G! Yeah. We're there, baby! You are the seniors at Santa Lucia. You set the styles, you set the pace, you set the example. Now, what I'm asking you to do and what I can only hope and pray you will do is to shepherd yourselves. Become a model for every student in Santa Lucia to follow and more than that, to look up to. Make yourselves proud, ladies and gentlemen. Give us that gift. Give us that example. Let it be your gift. The wolves are at our front door, friends. We can run, or we can fight. It's up to you. Young men, young ladies, thank you all for coming. I ask you, I beseech you to come to the aid of your principal, your school, your community. You must not fail us in our time of greatest need. Lend me your tired and your poor. Give me liberty or give me death! â™ª Oh, beautiful... Hey, hey, I didn't hear him say that. I didn't hear him say that. Are you kidding? What do you think he was talking about? He wants a junior police force. In a manner of speaking. Are you ready for that? Are you serious? You really think that's what he was asking for? I'm telling you. That's what the man wants. Baby pigs. Equalizers. Bam! To do what? BARNWELL: To keep these hallowed halls safe for democracy. Okay, so what we supposed to do? Go around giving lectures on the evils of drug abuse? Hey, let's get a group together and start kicking some tail. He's talking about hall monitors. He doesn't want the cops coming in here, and who does? Like he says, it's our school. So he wants us to do the job. You know, set the right examples, maybe put a little pressure on. Well, we're not the police. It's not our responsibility. No one else is doing anything, Christie. MULE: I think it's a great idea. We get together a unit, like 10 or 12 guys, we set up a chain of command, establish a war chest, commit assassinations of alleged enemies. We could take over this whole school. School? We could take over this whole town. MULE: Hey, check out the chick on the beach. She still thinks it's summer. Maybe I should introduce myself. You'll have to wait, man. I've got dibs. Hey, you guys thinking what I'm thinking? I don't know. What're you thinking? We could have some fun. Really? Doing what? Doing what the Groot asked us to do. Help clean up the school. I don't think the Groot knows what he wants. I think he just wants it all to go away like some bad dream. Yeah. That's the Groot, all right. What do you mean, "that's the Groot"? You ever know a person his age want anything different? MULE: Yeah.Who? Rambo. Well, I say we do it for him. Do what? Clean up the town, clean up the school? Exactly. I say we show him, we show all of 'em how it's done. So how's it done? You know that creep, Jerry Ramundi? Yeah, I know him. Well, you know he deals, right? Really? Come on, Scottie, everybody knows. He's practically in the yellow pages. I'm talking about dealing dust to kids. And this little dusthead, Jerry, he's the worst. So? So, I happen to know he's having a party Saturday night. I say we pay him a visit. You, you, me, Collin, Les, Barnwell. I'm going out with Christie. You go out with Christie every night. Give it a break, it's not gonna kill you. So, what do we do at this party? Derek, come on, I've got a test tomorrow. Since when do you like calculus more than me? I don't, but some of us mortals have to study. Well, fun's important, too. Yes, I know, I know. So is a college scholarship so fun will just have to wait till later. Which reminds me, are you gonna pick me up? What time? Um, I don't know. About 10:00? Ten it is. See you, beautiful. Hey, Derek? Yeah. I like you a lot more than calculus. Ah, that is such a relief. See you later. Don't worry, you'll be fine. You've got tables 10 through 15. Just smile and be friendly. Oh, and we're out of olives. Hi. Hi. How do I look? Okay? Yeah. Fine. Uh, you look really good. Thanks. Is it always this crowded? Yeah. I'm real nervous. Oh, don't be. You're gonna do great out there. What tables they give you? Uh, 10 through 15. Are those good? Yeah. They're mine. Really?Yeah. If you need a hand, I'll be right behind you, okay? Okay. Thank you. Go get 'em. It's really good, Jer. GIRL: Great party, Ramundi. Whoo! Hey, Ramundi, this is for you! BOY: Get out of here, man! BOY 1: Hey, Jerry! What did they do, man? Party crashed! GIRL: What do they want from you, Ramundi? Deal dust and die, suckers. The Brotherhood of Justice is watching you. BOY 2: Ramundi, what's this Brotherhood of Justice? What are you still doing here? Just waiting for somebody. Did you get stood up? No, he's just late. I can help you out with a ride if you'd like. No, that's okay. Thanks. Okay. Good night. Night. Look, it's getting cold out. I can still help you out with a ride if you want. Thanks. You're welcome. That was excellent! That was better than the infamous shaving cream wars of '85! Are you out of your mind? This was way better. This was incredible! Did you see Sally Emerson...Which one was she, man? Oh, man! The one with the see-through dress. This was the greatest thing we've ever done! Ever! I gotta admit that that was pretty damn terrific. And it's only the beginning. The Brotherhood of Justice. Where'd you get that? It must've been divine inspiration, man. Yes! Hey, the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood. The Brotherhood. COLLIN: The Brotherhood. BARNWELL: The Brotherhood. DEREK: The Brotherhood. What's happening? No hot date before homeroom? Got a problem? No. Are you sick or something? I'm fine. Yeah? So how come you're just lying there? We gotta leave for school pretty soon. 'Cause I feel like it. Were you planning on skipping? No. Did you eat breakfast yet? Not hungry. Well, rouse yourself, little brother. We leave in five. I'll be there. Today we're gonna be studying the gravity riddle. Now, if we can explain why an apple falls out of a tree, then we might also understand how time and space were created. Now, when Isaac Newton discovered his law of universal gravitation... Hi. he wasn't much older than you guys. He was 23 years old and he had just escaped from the city and the bubonic plague and made his discovery in the countryside. I plan on going to Harvard in the fall, not Lebanon. So who's next on the list? What list? We gotta have one. Barnwell? Yeah. We're hot here! Gimme the list. Whose name are we gonna put on this list? How about everybody picks two? So that makes 12 in all. LES: For starters. Whoever's stealing, whoever's dealing. Check. Perverts and deviants. Check. Short people, big guy. Double check. Ooh. Guys with earrings. We're gonna need an intelligence unit. DEREK: Barnwell. That's you.BARNWELL: Yeah. Hey, I wanna handle assassinations. Hey, aren't we gonna need some other stuff? You know, like a secret handshake? Yeah, yeah, that's it. A battle cry, a theme song. And we're gonna need a place to meet. Could use my uncle's carousel. It's closed in the winter. Does everybody understand one thing? Name it. Nobody breathes a word. Not about what we do, and not about who does it. No bragging, nothing. Vow of silence. Swear. Brotherhood and silence. Brotherhood and silence. ALL: Brotherhood and silence. Derek. All right! Hey. I was kidnapped by aliens. It won't work. How about, I'm sorry? Better. I was out with the guys. We got hung up, you know. You got hung up where? Jerry Ramundi's house? No, no, that wasn't us. I heard about it though. I came by Delmonico's but you'd already split. Well, what did you expect? I was freezing my tail off for half an hour. Okay, okay. I'm an idiot. So how did you get home? I called my mother.Ugh. No, I didn't. It was almost midnight. So what did you do? I got a ride home from a friend at work. Victor? â™ª Doom-de-doom-doom That is so dumb. What? A bunch of guys in Halloween masks, throwing firecrackers and stink bombs and pushing people into a pool? I think that's dumb. The way I heard it, they were trying to get a message across. Really? Like that? Like little kids? Beats getting busted by the cops, doesn't it? What, getting busted by a bunch of trick-or-treaters? See you at lunch? ALL: ...two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. DEREK: All right, guys. This time, we're gonna go for the Long Bomb. The Long Bomb?I mean the really long bomb. Go all the way, Scottie. Scottie's never been all the way. Playing guard, Der. Okay. So, what do I do?Like always... ALL: Protect your quarterback. On two. Ready?ALL: Break! Down. Set. Cheerleader 21! Cheerleader 22! Hut, hut! ...two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... All right, wise guys! Break it up. Everybody, two laps, on the double! Listen, run with us, huh? GIRL: Oh, no, we're getting enough exercise here. GIRLS: Hurry up, get out of here! Go! Run! Hey, Willie!Yeah. You okay, man?Fine. Then why are you taking a shower at three o'clock in the afternoon? 'Cause I feel like it! Hey! Derek! I'm gonna ask you once and if you don't tell me the truth, I'm gonna beat the crap out of you! Where'd you get it? School.Who from? What are you gonna do? Who from, Willie? This guy.What guy? I wanna know his name. He'll kill me.I'll kill you! I don't think he goes to our school. I wanna know his name now, Willie. Carleton. Carleton Links? Okay. Listen to me, little man. If you ever use that stuff again or anything like it, or if I even hear that you had, we're finished. Do you understand me? Do you? Yes. I'm sorry, Derek. It's okay. You're a good kid. It's not just this, not just this... Okay, now you're wrong 'cause it's not the whole carburetor. It's the whole thing. It's happened before, man. I know what I'm talking about. The car won't run... Don't get an attitude, you know? I've done this before, man. What's happening? Carleton Links. What about him? I want him. He's on the list, man. Number five. Yeah, well, he just made number one. DEREK: There's that scum Links. Look at him. Come on, that's enough. That's enough! Later, dude. A fractured jaw, a couple of broken ribs, One of them nicked a lung. Was he rolled? Well, he had over 400 bucks on him when they found him and enough drugs to start his own pharmacy. Could that be why I'm not crying? What do we know about this Brotherhood of Justice? Nothing. They came out of nowhere. Let's see what we can find out. All right. But maybe we'd better not try too hard, huh? Just do it, Mac. We've got enough problems. I don't need to add Zorro to the list. I hear ya. BARNWELL ON PA: Attention, all students. You are being watched. Every day you wake, every purse you take, every test you fake, every wrong you make, every rule you break will put your lives at stake. From the Brotherhood of Justice. Attention, all students. You are being watched. Every day you wake, every purse you take, every test you fake... Who's responsible for this? It's a tape, Mr. Grootemat. Someone's got it into the system. Who the hell is responsible for monitoring the system and why isn't it locked up? ...every rule you break will put your lives at stake. From the Brotherhood of Justice. You should have seen the look on the Groot's face after he heard it. I would give you a zillion dollars to see that look. How did Barnwell do it? Oh, he's an electronics genius. He gets it from his old man. And dig this, Derek. He wants to start bugging people's houses, you know. Teeny-weeny microphones, miniature video cameras, our boy is freaking out. Okay, so we're still meeting at 5:00, right? Right.Yeah. BARNWELL: All right, targets. We've got 11 in all. LES: So far. So what we out to do is put 'em in priority order. MULE: Okay, dustheads first. LES: Dealers first.Right, first the dealers, then the dustheads. Then what?Thieves. Homos.BARNWELL: Get serious. Perry Willis. Perry? He's a shakedown artist. He goes after the little kids. Yeah, but we've been playing ball with the guy for two years, man. Maybe. But who ever said we liked him? I don't think old Perry's had to pay for his lunch since what? Ninth grade? Okay, Perry's a possibility. Who else? What about Benny whathisname? Kitchner. No, no, Kitiridge. Benny Kitiridge. Right. He's a bad dude. Says who? He's Mr. Chop Shop, man. I mean, his car is like a jigsaw puzzle. I think he's got a piece ripped off of every set of wheels in town. Except mine. All right, look. Making a list is fine, putting it in order is fine, but there's one thing we'd better be sure of. Before we hit somebody, anybody, we'd better know they deserve getting hit. Rumor won't do it. Yeah, the gentleman's right. That's why we've got yours truly, the intelligence unit. Okay. Who on this list can we confirm, Barnwell? Billy Tremaine. Way to go, big man. Tremaine has my vote. DEREK: What do we know about this guy? He's scum. This guy, he's dirtier than... He's scum. You got any facts, Barnwell? He's a heavy dealer. He deals grass laced with PCP. Kids, they don't know what's happening to them. He's the pits. Let's hit him. Let's hit him hard. Yeah. The Brotherhood. The Brotherhood. ALL: The Brotherhood. Yeah! DEREK: What did you say? Not much. GUY: Whoa, wait up! I like your car. Yours ain't so bad either. How's Christie doing? What do you mean? Here or at work? Whatever. She's doing fine. She only worked at couple of days last week. I guess it takes a little while to get used to things. Mm. You like her? I like any girl who can whistle with her fingers. I like her too. I know. The thing is, um... we've been going together pretty steady for about two years now. I know that too. What else do you know? Not much else. Look, I gotta get going, Derek. It was nice talking to ya. Yeah, it was nice talking to you too, Victor. Hey, you take care of that car now, okay? That I will. See you around. Yeah. See you around. BOY 1: I wanna see his face when he sees this. BOY 2: My God! His car! I don't believe it! BOY 3: Those guys are serious. GIRL 1: I don't believe it! DEREK: Let's huddle up. Let's huddle up. Let's go. Post right 56, all right? On one. Ready! ALL: Break! He's on the list, man. Perry?Yeah. MULE: Now? Maybe we ought to clear it with Derek first. Now! DEREK: Red 16! Red 16! Set, hut! COACH: What the hell is going on here? Since when did we start double-teaming our own guys? He's a punk. I've been stabbed! I've been stabbed! Someone help! Somebody help me! I've been stabbed! Ah! Quick! Get somebody. Help me! We do this the right way or we end it right here, right now. Tremaine was a confirmed target, Derek. Six votes, all in favor. In favor of what? Roughing him up. But knifing him? No way! What did you want us to do, Derek? Pants him? Swipe his favorite pen and pencil set? Yeah, I mean, the punk got what he deserved, Derek. Maybe more, but he'll get a tetanus shot and a few stitches and that'll be it. Except that he'll remember it every time he sits down for the next three weeks. And who did it to him. Who's gonna tell Perry Willis who did it to him? You rolled all over him like a freight train and he doesn't even know why. Yeah, I know. I should've whispered in his ear. This is no joke, Mule! We're trying to make a point out there! When we hit somebody, we do it as the Brotherhood. and we leaving a calling card so they and everybody else learns a lesson. No screw-ups. And that goes double for Billy Tremaine. I'm making a rule. If you don't like it, tell me now and I'm gone. From here on out, we don't use knives. No weapons, nothing. We don't need them! Somebody needs to be muscled and we vote on it unanimously, okay. We wanna scare somebody, fine. We wanna have some fun, good. But I'm drawing a line right now. And nobody crosses it. Okay. Sure. Okay. Okay. Barnwell, who's next on the list? Well, Mule wants Eddie Krasnick. Yes! More affectionately known as Pastey. Do I know him? Sure you do. Pastey Krasnick. He's that little geeky guy on the stage crew that does the slide shows and stuff. He works over at Delmonico's, Derek. What about him, Mule? The geek got me busted on my Biology final last year. Yeah, he rats on everybody like he's on a crusade. He's a self-righteous geek and I say we get him. Besides, man, the guy gets more girls than he knows what to do with. And he's ugly too. If he's such a loser, how come anybody even comes near him? Geek appeal. Works everytime. Victor! What's happening? Just keeping busy. Yeah, I bet you are. So, what time does Christie come on? Later on tonight, I guess. You should know. She's your girl, isn't she? So, you like working here? It's all right. How's the pay? Not bad. Good. I am glad to hear that, Victor. I am certainly glad to hear that. Careful you don't drop anything. I'll make sure of it. See you around. Count on it. What is the matter with you? Why didn't you do anything? You know, all you had to do was give me a sign. I would've done it for you, man. I don't know, dude. You're starting to worry me, man. Check it out, check it out. It's our boy, Pastey. Okay. Remember him now, man? Yeah, I've seen the jerk around. For too long. Does he have any wheels? He rides a ten-speed. His father had him sell his car the last time he got a 502. A geek, a snitch and a lush. I don't know. Okay, we do it now. Let's go outside and have a chat with Mr. Krasnick. Derek, my man, let's do it. What do you want? We want you, Pastey. BARNWELL: Repent, sinner, and get ready to meet your maker. Leave me alone. Down on your knees, geek. VICTOR: Whoa, whoa! DEREK: Hey, no! You're having a problem with these guys, Eddie? I don't even know who they are. Get behind me.What? Get behind me, now. You're making a mistake, hero. Yeah, tell me without the mask and maybe I'll believe you. Hey, you're gonna get hurt, boy. You know, the suspense is already killing me. Really? This is your lucky night, pal. See, the Brotherhood's got a list and you're not on it. Yet.Watch your back, Pastey. I still owe you, man. Are you sure it was him? It was a quarterback and a couple of guys from the football team. You know, I don't understand him. Billy Tremaine, Pastey. How could he even be a part of that? I don't know him, Christie. All I know is that half the school thinks they're heroes and the other half seems to be jumping for cover. He's just not like that. People change. My mother and father were married for ten years. Now they hate each other. Why? I don't know. I don't know what to do, Victor. We've been together almost two years, I just don't understand him anymore. Maybe he's not who you think he is. Maybe he's not who he thinks he is. I don't know. Hey, Christie! Wait a minute here, little brother, I got something I gotta do. Come on, Derek. I don't want to be late for homeroom. Just a minute. I get it. Christie! Come on! Hey. Let me go, Derek.What's the matter with you? Why didn't you call me back last night? Did you and the guys have fun last night? Victor told me all about it. Victor? What'd he say? Derek, don't bother lying. You were there. You're part of it. What did Pastey ever do to anybody? You don't understand. And you do? You and your little commando pals flying around town like Superman? You don't know what you're talking about. "Deal dust and die"? You and your red hand prints and you're beating people up? Derek, it's a big joke. A lot of people don't see it that way. Well, I do. Come on! Derek, just leave me alone. You're making too big a thing out of this, Christie. Come on, let me take you back to school, okay? I'd rather walk. You know, that's it. You think everything is that easy. You just hop in your little sports car and you forget it all. You've had your whole life handed to you on a silver platter. Everything comes easy for you. It's easy for you to get into Harvard, you're captain of the football team, you've never had to work. And now all of a sudden you go around picking on people because you think you're chosen. You're gonna decide who's good and who's bad. Derek, I want to understand. Maybe you should try and explain to me why. Maybe I'll see around sometime, huh? Derek, why don't you talk to me? What is it? What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything, Christie. Not of anything or anyone. What's the matter with Christie? She's another chick who thinks she knows it all. I wanna ask you something. What? Can't I have some music? No, this is serious. No, it's not that. I promised, didn't I? Okay. Then what? You'll tell me the truth? Since when do I lie to you? I wanna know if you're in that Brotherhood of Justice. Where'd you get that idea? Well, everybody's talking about it. Talking about it how? Well, how great it is. Like Rambo and Chuck Norris. And how they think you're running it. Is that what you think? Yeah, kind of. Well, I hate to burst your bubble, little man, but it ain't me. Think I'm too young to join? What exactly did you say in this speech of yours, Bob? Who told you about it? I hear things. Doesn't matter from who. It was an address to the entire senior class. And I'll tell you this. There are a hell of a lot of special kids in that class. Bright kids, leaders! Yeah. Who bust up one kid so badly he'll be sucking his meals through a straw for the next two months! And knife another one in the back? It wasn't his back. Are you gonna defend these creeps, Bob? I don't have to defend anyone! And you haven't got proof that anyone who's involved even goes to this school! I'd like you to give me some names, Bob. Names of the boys that you think might be in on this Brotherhood. I haven't the vaguest idea who might be involved. We are investigating two felonies here, Bob! These aren't pranks! And I'm trying to run a school! This isn't working. And you know it's not working. Do I? I'm not so sure. The kids are talking. I hear them. They like what's going on. I've got 3,000 kids here and all but a handful of them are good kids, decent kids. They don't like it when their friends end up wrapped around telephone poles because some punk turns them on to PCP. They don't like it when somebody gets raped or beat on! But they like the idea of a bunch of thugs running around like vigilantes. Is that it? No, you don't know and I don't know, not for a fact, that any student at Santa Lucia has anything at all to do with this Brotherhood. And personally, I don't think they do. All I know is, I asked for help, I asked for leadership. And the way I see it, the results aren't in yet. I'm not ready to call it quits. Hey! That's my bike! Hey! Hey! Hey! I called the cops, but what the hell are they gonna do? The sucker flew out of here going 90 before he even hit the street! He was probably halfway to Little TJ before I got to the phone. Why TJ?I saw him, right? Mexican? How many guys do you know with black hair and a sun tan in the middle of October?Okay. Four o'clock. Carousel. Everybody, okay? You got it. Don't worry about anything. We're gonna get it back. Brotherhood, man. Right? Right. Football hut. Huh! You got any idea what we could be letting ourselves in for? They're Mexican, Scottie, not Mau Maus. You ever been up there? It's a jungle, man. Hey, I'm not kidding you. So it's a jungle. So what? We're the Great White Hunters. Listen, Scottie's right. It's their turf. They could eat us for breakfast. The bike insured, man? Are you kidding? You expect the cops to get it back for you? Yeah. And I still believe in Santa Claus. Look, man. What do you wanna do, Collin? The way I see it, it's your ball. What do you think? We started this thing for a reason. And part of it was to get back at guys who mess with us. Except it's not exactly like that, Derek. That's right. The beaners got to know what we're here for. Les, we're going in for the bike. Hey, these guys don't mess around, man. These guys carry guns. So who says we can't? I say. Call it, Collin. It's your bike, it's your call. You wanna go in, we'll go in with you, man. You want to write it off, just say so. Okay. Let's go for it. We go in tonight. Righteous. MULE: Does anybody want to change their mind? Well, vamanos, muchachos. And vaya con Dios,my darlings. MULE: We got company. Relax, boys. They're not bothering us. Not yet. Told you this was a stupid idea. BARNWELL: Shut up, Scottie. Hey, I like your car, man. Thanks. Wanna trade? Not tonight, pal. You see that driveway coming up over there? Yeah. That's where we stop, man. Yeah? For what? Because I asked you real nice, right? Do what he says. SCOTTIE: Are you nuts? Do it, Mule. Are you crazy? You go to Santa Lucia, right? Football player. Quarterback. That's right. You go there too? Last year. I seen you play. You're pretty good, man. Thanks. So what'd you come here for, quarterback? A friend's bike was stolen. Big Roadster. Red. We're looking for it. So why'd you come here, man? You think I stole it? We don't know who stole it. We're just looking, that's all. You think a Mexican stole your friend's bike? I saw the guy. Oh, you saw the guy? That's right.Why didn't you stop him, man? He was too far away. But you saw him, right? He had black, greasy hair, huh? And brown skin. And he was wearing chinos and his shoes were really shiny, right? He had some tattoos, man? Maybe a big snake wrapped around a cross? Yeah. And he was scarfing down a taco and he had chili sauce dripping on his shirt. You know what I mean? Go home, quarterback. And if we don't? Then we're gonna rent a helicopter and take it to 3,000 feet and drop you like a sack of sewage. We don't know nothing about no motorcycles, man. And we don't need no white boys playing cops. Go back to Santa Lucia, quarterback. And don't come back here. Unless you come as my friend. Get out of here, man. We're lucky to be alive. What do we do now? We made a mistake. Let's not make it any worse. I say they got it. I don't give a damn what you say. Look, I don't know... The guy who stole it was really far away. I couldn't swear he was Mexican. And even if he was, he could've taken it anywhere, not just here. DEREK: Let's go home, Mule. You forgot something, Les. Next time, leave it at home, Les. No guns, got it? We almost needed it tonight, Derek. Les was prepared. Yeah, man, if it'd gotten hairy, it might've stopped 'em, right? You guys out of your minds? What would you have done if they hadn't? Blown their heads off? Huh? You blew it. You went chicken on us, man. I mean, we could've had those guys... You okay, man? Let's get out of here. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Les. You go ahead. Come on, I'll drive you home. Just take off, will ya? I've been looking for you, man. Hey, Mule. You shouldn't have hit Les like that. I mean, he's one of us. It's dead, Mule. I mean, it's wiped out. It's finished. What is? What are you talking about? The Brotherhood. A thing either it has life, Mule, or it's dead. You're wrong. Remember when we played Val Verde last year? And we were down. What was it? 31-zip at the half. Yeah. We ended up winning. How? How did we win? We came back in the second half. How do you think? Yeah, but why? Where did it come from? What do you mean, "why, where did it come from?" What are you talking about? What I'm talking about, Derek, is you. You're where it came from, man. Yeah, we came back and we kicked some tail, but we couldn't have done it without you, we wouldn't have done it without you. The Brotherhood's a team, man. You're the leader of that team and without you, we're nothing. This isn't a game, Mule. No. It's better. I mean, we're the Brotherhood, man! So, like, what are you gonna do? It's up to you, man. Do we march... or do we die? BOY 1: He's gonna be mad. BOY 2: Why would they do that to it. It's just a couple of lowriders cars. GIRL: Whose car is that? SCOTTIE: Look what they did to the lowriders cars. BOB: When I called you here previously, I asked you to give some thought to the problems we're experiencing. And even though I didn't directly request that you either individually or collectively... attempt to do something about these problems, it was implied. I don't know if any of you here have been involved in... certain events which have recently transpired. But if we learn anything in school, I'd like to think it's that violence isn't the answer to violence and that societies can't amend their ills by adding to them. Hooligans and thugs are the problem, not the solution. If any of you are among those... who've tried to help, the way you've chosen to do it is wrong. It's very wrong! Vigilantism, regardless of motive, regardless of intention, is criminal. And I condemn it and anyone who's party to it. Starting Monday, I've asked a private security company to patrol the campus on a daily basis. I saw it's not over until we say it's over. Hey, who the hell did the man think he was talking to? When the going gets tough... The heat is on, boys. The man is only responding the way he's been trained to respond. The Brotherhood is the only force of law and order left around here. And I'm not quitting. Derek? I don't know. Great. You don't know? What is that supposed to mean? It means I don't know. Maybe Grootemat has a point. Somebody hits, then we hit back. Then what? They hit back harder. Where does it end? As far as I'm concerned, we still got our list. I'm not backing off once inch. Wait a second, Les... No, you wait a second! This is not your private party, Derek! We're all in this together, just like we started. All right, Grootemat started it, I plan to finish it. And if you're with me, we meet at the carousel tonight. You're in... or you're out. Looking good, Scottie. I'm in, guys. What are you gonna do, Derek? When I decide, Mule, I'll let you know. Hey, hey. There's Derek. Which is the numerator, the one on the top or the bottom? What? The numerator. You know, math. Derek, you gotta help me. I've tried this problem three times and gotten three different answers. Not now, Willie, okay? I'm going out. I'm late. Yeah, so am I. This stuff's due tomorrow morning. You going out with Christie? No, Mule and the guys. Christie's out. You guys really broke up, huh? All the way. That's too bad. I like Christie. Yeah. Too bad. See you later. SCOTTIE: Hi, Derek. Scottie. You going up there? No. What's happening? I'm quitting, Derek. What? It started out to be fun, you know. It started out to be a real kick. But it's not anymore. I mean, stomping on those dudes' cars that way just 'cause they're Mexican, that's not right, man. I'm getting out. You don't think it's gonna get me in trouble with the other guys, do you? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. What about you? You staying in? I have to. I started it. See you around, Derek. Yeah. See you around, Scottie. How late are they? Half hour. Hey, look, they'll be here. How much longer are we supposed to keep waiting? Here's the flash bulletin from Intelligence. COLLIN: We're listening. A little tidbit of information has been added to Pastey Krasnick's file. Let's hear it. All right. It seems that Pastey has served all his time and all restrictions on his license have been removed, And so, like, what does that mean? No more ten speed? No. Not for Pastey. He purchased a new set of wheels. A very lovely new set of wheels that I saw pulling into The Oasis on the way down here today. No kidding? What are we standing around here, talking about it for? We're not just standing, Les. We're waiting for Derek and for Scottie. Remember that? Like I said, how much longer are we supposed to keep waiting? I'm sorry about the other day. And the Brotherhood? Is the Brotherhood sorry? Derek, you've gotta stop this before it gets any worse. They're your buddies. They'll listen to you. What if they don't listen? What if I can't stop them? What am I gonna do? Call Grootemat, call the cops? I'm not going to rat on my friends. Well, then you'll have to figure something else out. This made so much sense in the beginning. Doesn't make any sense right now, does it? Nothing does. Can I pick you up later? I've already made plans. I'd better be getting up there. They're waiting for me. Derek... You know, whatever Grootemat wanted, it wasn't what you gave him. And he's asked you to stop. And I'm asking you to stop. What are you gonna do? You guys remember my old Mustang? Look what I got instead. My dad gave in. Look at that. Isn't it great? Pastey's on the move. Okay. He's with a couple of guys, so don't miss. Do I ever? COLLIN: Light it up, Mule. Yeah. COLLIN: Go for it, hotshot! Oh, my God. PASTEY: My car! Go call the fire department. Somebody do something! Look at my car! BOY: Hey! Over here! GIRL: Hurry up! Hey, Derek. Whose car? Eddie Krasnick. Poor sucker just bought it. LES: Oh, man! Oh, man! Yeah! Wasn't that great? We are it, man! Are we it? I can't believe it. Did you see the look on Pastey's face? Did you see that, man? I bet the geek's car is still burning. Now, that is a picture I want! Barnwell, why didn't you bring you camera? Are you serious? If I'd known it was gonna look that good, I'd have got my video camera, lights, everything. Special effects. Everything. Hey, listen up, guys. Listen up. We gotta do something for Derek, man. COLLIN: What do you mean? I mean, he's hurting. We gotta do something. That's understandable, Mule. That geek, Victor, is moving in on him. I said this two weeks ago, didn't I? I said we add this guy to the list, but no, standing here, talking about it. So who says it's too late? No, no, no. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Nobody gets on the list unless we all agree. We've been through this before, man. And what? Derek won't agree. Well, that's it.He considers it personal. But it's eating him up, guys! Four of us are a majority, right? A clear majority. Except it's not unanimous. It has to be unanimous. Barnwell? Well, uh... considering the circumstances, maybe an exception to the rule might be in order. Mule, Mule, Mule. Come here. Talk to us, huh? What do you think? Call it. Oh, man! You're a pig. You're such a pig. Have another beer. Have another drink. Keep drinking, man. COLLIN: I'm straight, man. Yeah, I know. You're cutting paper dolls. You're cutting paper dolls. Oh, man. All these horses. I'm allergic to horses. Whoa! Big D! What's happening, man? We've been waiting for you. Is that right?Yeah! Seen Scottie? DEREK: Yeah. Where the hell is he? Don't know. Home, maybe. MULE: What's he doing home, man? He's supposed to be here with us. And so were you. He's out. Out of what? The Brotherhood. He quit. COLLIN: No. Scottie? What's his problem? 'Cause he's chicken. Always has been. Are you guys crazy? I mean, Santa Lucia's a safer place tonight because you torched Pastey's car and trashed some lowriders' wheels? LES: Derek, you see, we got this problem. Pastey and the Mexicans, see, they're part of it. We said we're gonna clean up this place and that's what we're gonna do. Problem? Pastey's a problem? You're the problem now, Les. You and your private hit list. Who's gonna be on the list next? Grootemat? How about Scottie? How about the chop suey joint on the beach? Les, you don't like Chinese food that much, do you, huh? Come on. That's all we do is fight. That's nice. That's good. Come on, man. Don't take it like that. Come on, when we started this, you were with us. We're the Brotherhood. We take care of each other. Come on, bro. We took care of you tonight. That's right. We took care of you. For you, Derek. And for Victor Parks. What about Victor? Come on, man. It's not like he's your best friend or anything. The punk moved in on Christie, didn't he? What goes on between me and Christie is my business, not yours. Not any of yours. I think it would be best if we told Derek about our little surprise. What surprise? We had a vote and we put Victor on the list. To help you out. Help me out how? By doing what? By putting a hurt on him, man. What? What kind of hurt? It's no big thing, man. It's just that big car he drives, that old antique. We wired it. You what? We, uh, set up a little surprise for our boy, Victor. With a trip wire, actually. See, he opens the door... bang, he loses his front end. Hey, Derek! Come on, man. Hey, give us a break, man. It's no big deal. We were doing you a favor. Come on. Get back inside. Good night. Good night, Victor. No! Don't move! Don't open the door! It's wired! Just don't move, okay? Not an inch! Come on! Get away from the car, man. Do it now. What the hell is this? Another one of your jokes? Get back, man! Damn it! Do what I say! Okay. Okay, okay. I'll amuse you. This is not funny. You put a damn bomb in my car. Victor, come on, man. Get back. Call the cops. Tell them it's by the oil pan. Pipe about a foot long. I don't know exactly what's in it.
