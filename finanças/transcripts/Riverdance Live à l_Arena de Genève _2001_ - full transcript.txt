(lively music) (gentle music) - [Narrator] Out of the dark we came, out of the sea, when a long wave broke on the shore. As the day broke and the night rolled back, there we stood on the land we would call home. Out of the dark we came, out of the night, the first of many mornings in this new place. When the sun rolled back the mist, we rose like a strong wave on land. Now we were the people of this place. What burns through the rain and mist? What banishes dark? What makes the children straight and bright? What makes the mountain sharp? The sun is our lord and father, bright face at the gate of day, comfort of home, cattle, and crop, Lord of the Morning, Lord of the Day. Lifting our hearts, we sing his praise, dance in his healing rays.

Our great Cuhlainn. He was a shield of bronze, a wall of stone. He was a spear of light, a watcher in high places, a rock in the river. He was the sun of morning, he was a fire at night. He was a powerful story. He was lightning in forest, a sudden storm, a short life. ("Caoineadh Chu Chulainn") (audience applauding) Thunder and lightning batter the rocks. The winds howl, (wind howling) and great storms break on the forest, scatter the herds like grain. Fire leaps from dark to dark. (thunder rumbling) Fear and anger leap to meet it. We will not go down. We will not be beaten down like grain. ("Thunderstorm") - Hey!

I was the land and the land was me. Tall and straight I walked in the world, but Bell and Cross banished my comfort. Ragged and bruised I flee from branch to branch. The thorns scourge me. I have no peace by night or day.

We found a fort here. We loved and died here. Wave after wave, the sea of time beats against every shore. We have seen smoke of war climb from our fields of grain, a stain over the sun. The crops wither. The bones of hunger walked the sunken roads in the black rain of ruin. Whole generations lift now to depart. The land has failed us. The dark soldiers appear against us. In dance and song, we gift and mourn our children. They carry us over the ocean in dance and song.

And the old land still gives us fields of grain, just as it does here. The rivers everywhere run down to the sea, and the land everywhere takes life from the river. Tomorrow, the sun will rise on plains of gold. My heart will heal. Here on a new shore, I raise my head, the new step hammering through the memory of the old. It is all a journey, from one land to the next, from one life to another, remaking ourselves always under the same sun and moon. A generation later, that immigrant's child stands for the first time on the old land, familiar yet strange. A bittern weaves its music over the mountain, memory rich in song. The heart come home.
