Marie, well, I'll ask then. You really wanted that I would ask? - No, I lied. About? - About who I wanted to ask. So you're a liar? Very disappointing. No, I'm not a liar. Who is it? Jas.

I thought maybe you were not coming. - That's a surprise for you or not? Why do you wear sunglasses? Because I like to wear. Then you feel a kind of famous. You're weird. - And you're so normal, Arch. I do try. - I know that. How is your music? - It's all right. Coffee? - Coffee, I thought you wanted a drink.

We use the images from the cameras ... along with those in the documentary style a portable camera. How are your settings? Goes well, it is not so ... Then should we do with it. Cameras with night vision. Those guys make sure all the action. And this will all record. - Cool. You really are a virgin? - Yeah, why can not you believe? I do not know, you're just beautiful. - Just? Well, very beautiful. - And all the beautiful people are not a virgin? Of course, but virgins 17 years old are quite rare in London. I think it's nice to be rare. And you look great, by the way. - Thank you. So when you imagine your parents? -. I do not know They go crazy when they hear that I'm going to commit suicide. What if I tell them that I tried you to keep away from it They would probably say that you're talking about the wrong girl. You're doing the right girl. The world is just not good. When you imagine me to your parents? - I live with my grandmother. What is she like? - She's a party animal frankly. I want to meet her. - Yes, now? Yeah, come on. Why would such a beautiful girl think there is no other option? I do not know. It's heartbreaking. What I do not understand, why she has come here today. I do not understand. Those damn kids Would you do this? - Yes. Let's do it. What are you looking for? - A handkerchief. Did you cut yourself? - Yes, something like that damn tray. The old hunting knife from my father is there. A hunting knife? Where he hunted? He always took it as we went camping when I was little. And where is he now? In hell, probably. No nightmares. - Arch? Is that a compliment? Where are we? - Where are we both? You and me. - We're in your bag. Stay with me in life. - What? Let us live and then we'll see how it goes, Jas. We'll see how it goes? - Yes. It's not going anywhere, Arch. Jas, you put me thinking about how things ... Do not be so damn nice to me. - How could I have done to you? I do not know, you do not know me. - I know what I feel for you. And I know that I do everything possible want to know about you. What do you want me to tell you, Arch? Want to share sad stories with me? You want me to tell you that my mom was crazy when I was little. And I left because I could not stand? You want me to tell you that I sometimes same hear little voices they heard? And Arch, I would rather die now, than I even a little as if it is. Yes. - You're not a superhero, Arch. You can not save me. And this is not the reality. JANICE EDEN Beloved mother and daughter Okay guys, that's the homework. Until next week. page but this week. Well done, thank you. Archie, can I talk to you? - Yes. How are things at home? - Yes, well. Are you okay with your grandmother? - Yeah, why do you ask? Because your homework deteriorates. I was wondering whether it is okay. I will try harder. - I will not beg. If you need anything, just ask. I'm a friend, Archie. And I know what's going on. What was that about? - He had a difficult time. I just watch him a bit. - Be careful. I know you're involved, but do not get too close. Yes, that's a good point, thank you. You've done everything possible with Amber. - Yes, I know. Have you heard? - Heard what? That bitch has committed suicide. - What? That damned Barbie. She herself cut open with her models job. Slut who could not wait. - Wait, Samantha? Yes, Samantha, stubborn bitch. - Where are the others? Way. We come across half an hour together, it's important. They are always late. I think that fat is stopped what to eat to get. I can not believe Samantha really did it. Through this kind of thing I think of my mother. How they would feel. - Be glad they still talking to you. I'm indoors. What is it with your family, McEwen? You never talk about your little room. Cannabis sell a girl pregnant, Father found out and sent me away. That is severely punished. - And your mother? They chose his side. - So you're father? No, she had a miscarriage. - Look who's coming. Listen, I need to do something. I'll see you at school. Excuse me, I was wondering if you know anything about Samantha Reardon ... whether it was suicide or ... - Sorry, I can not talk about it. I organize a party ... and I would like it if you would come. We have a free day, so I would do not know why. Do you understand that you just police for our suicide have invited? Do you think she's about 16 years? - Yeah, so what? I pull it anymore. Who's there? Hello? Help me. Why are you angry? Well, I'll call the police. This is not funny, Kenny. This is not funny, guys. Why are you doing this? Hello, with the police? Someone is trying to murder me. I'm on the Wet College. Coat, come here, what happened? Come here. I said, I'm there when I get there. You know what I do for work. I have to go. Yes, I love you too. Sorry, I want to stay. Ask here - No, I have it with Jasmin. Do not worry about her. It'll be fine. It is important, come. We want to know what you saw, when you found Jasmin. She was locked in the box. And that guy was gone when I got there. Why are you asking me this? Should you not pick these guys? So you have not really seen this guy? - No, like I said, he was gone ... by the time I came. And it's a mess out there. It's not that they invent. - No, they did not invent it this way. What do you mean, so to speak? Archie, the family of Jasmin a history of delusions. So we want to know if there really a crazy guy with a mask on ... was at the College ... - Or that she imagined that? Jasmin's mother dies to multiple personality disorder ... that means they sometimes alter egos has. That can be very confusing for her. But she is not her mother. No, but it is often hereditary. So you're saying it did not happen? - No, I'm not saying. We just do not know for sure. - Why? There were no real signs of a struggle. One does not see masked man go away. And the bruises Jasmin can they caused themselves. It seems that you have already decided. - Archie, the police ... a search begins for a masked killer, they should know the facts. Well, I believe her. - What you do or do not believe ... is not really relevant. Can I go now? - Yes. Good. That is the last time you see Eden's son. Ask only those who inspires me, Davey. - Who inspires you? Do you have the song: "I do not like Mondays" ever heard? About that girl ... Wait a minute size, what happened? Someone Jas attacked. We need to find out who it was. - Yes, it takes away our publicity. This is the way Davey, he is doing publicity for our group. Hello, how are you? - Publicity? Yes, I'll shoot him full. - We're not losers, but with style. What's wrong with him? - He's always crabby. Let's do an interview. - That Bob Geldof thing ... 'I do not like Mondays' ... - What's in that bag, Davey? For if I need a blackout light and ... Cool, well thought out. So I ask yet again. JAMESY, WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING? Come inside. How are you, darling? - Well, thank you, Katie. You should try to rest. Jim and I are there. We guard the fort. Have you heard some of the College? - Yes. No one else saw anything, sweetheart. Coat, do you know for sure? Yes, I'm sure. - Of course you know it. Shall I get you something to drink? - No, thank you, Katie. Okay, goodnight sweetheart. Goodnight. Coat, it's me. Why are you doing in my house? - I rang ... but your family would not let me inside. - You do not climb through windows at people. Jas, I had to see you. I have to trust you. - You can trust me. Coat, listen to me, I swear I would never hurt you. No one will hurt you. Come here. Is it? - Yes, well. Shall we get something to eat? - Yes, there is a Fatboy tent around the corner. Let's go there, man. Start filming. What the hell is that, Kenny? He is my father. Good Dad? But why did you? - Move the camera back to me. I thought, why I have to share the spotlight with those losers? We're not going to die anyway, so why also the history books? Are you going to shoot them? - Yes. Why commit suicide, if you a mass murderer can be? So you want now as serial killer be remembered? That's not a serial killer, Davey. - Yes, because a serial killer kills ... more than three people. - No Davey, a serial killer ... someone who is more than three people killed in a period of 30 days. I do massacre, not like a mad, because I do it in different locations. To be honest, I kill everyone at the party. Everyone at the party. - Write on, everyone on the damn party. The damn party. Have you talked to Jasmin? -. I do not know I have not seen, so I do not know anything. - Archie. What? - Think about it. He appears suddenly, minutes after that the killer is gone. Furthermore, no one will see. Someone off - Why would Archie, like murder Jasmin? Why we plan a suicide pact? Because we are unstable. No, it was not Archie. - I tell you ... there is psychotic on Archie written his forehead. I do not understand why these two agents, hang on this Board. They do nothing. - And what about Mr. Hudson? He always looks very scary to me. - Listen, if it was someone, Kenny. Kenny is really a suspect. - Yes, but why? He puts so much time in organizing of this whole thing covenant. Maybe he got so excited, that he can not wait. It actually does not matter anyway, we will still be dead soon. We really go through with it? We really throw everything away and say that there is nothing to live for? I do not know what you think, but so are together with you ... is that I have my reservations. Yes, I have first still a few things to do. So if you stop? - Ash? I do not know, with the death of Amber and Samantha and now Jasmin ... which is attacked. That makes you think the things that you leave behind. The people. Let's just about meditating. And this. We need something fun to do all together. - I'm already on it. Take a trip to hell. - I've never been so happy. Kenneth has told the others? - Kenny is crazy. Kenny can fuck off. - Arch and Jasmin are not there. They have something together. - Do you? I'm sure. - Who can live on? We go live. - We go live. We go live. - I'm not living. We go live. - We go live. Everyone dies. MAM. CAN WE TALK? Watch it, asshole. You had me, thick. - I have nothing. Come on, man up and down. - I have nothing. Leave me alone. I'll kill you. What is going on? I'll take both of you sissies. What is that thick? Fat has a knife. Come on, fatty. Let's see if you're going to use it? Give me that knife. Try it with me, Curtis. I know how to use it. You're making a big mistake. Arch? What was that about? Come and get me. That hurt. You call it arrive on time? Kenny, it's over. We do not. - What do you say? And if I find out that you have attacked Jasmin ... I'll kill you. Are you serious? Come. - I do not know if that was a good idea. That asshole is an asshole. It is past I'm out. You can keep the money. I'm out. Do you think it was Kenny you tried to murder? Where is your knife? - We all need to pay attention. Kenny is impaired. - Why do not we tell the police What should we tell them? - He plans a suicide pact? Then we are also involved. - Maybe we can say that ... we think he has attacked Jasmin. -. They do not believe Why not? - Trust me, because Hudson thinks ... we're crazy. - Hudson? Yes, he's a fucking dick. The best we can do, is going to the party tonight ... and enjoy the fact that we do not die. Think you that a week ago, we wanted the opposite. Yes, may we thank Kenny. Why do not we just? Murder him That's what he wants. Honey, I'm home. Hello, where are your lips? Honey, are you asleep? No! He's had it. - Yes, he and his wife. Damn, so Jasmin, might be telling the truth. Yes, unless ... - Unless what? Unless they did it. - Why would she do that? I do not know, we have Archie told earlier that she was lying. Maybe he told her. She wanted to make her story credible. And then killed Hudson. Yes. - Coffee? We need tonight remain at that party together. I can not believe that someone has planted so. Yes, he must have heard that Archie was talking about him. What do you mean? - You saw how he looked at Curtis. Archie is impaired guest. I would not be surprised, as Archie was that guy. Man, Archie is a good guy. - Okay, I'm just saying. Archie is different. It puts me or thinking. Why James had a knife? Who do you, Curtis or Kenny? - They can be both. They are both impaired and to be honest ... there is the possibility that someone which we did not know. Yeah, I thought so already. Or that camera guy who is always with Kenny. I have not seen. - How have you seen him? He is every day at school. - No, never noticed. In any case, I have to go. All getting ready for tonight. They are also ungrateful. After all the work I did. What will you do now? Nothing has changed. I do not want to die. That has changed. Come here. Davey, my friend. If you make a covenant with the devil ... you will not change my mind at the gate of hell. Who's there? I can not live without you. Please do not fuck with me, girl. There are not many girls who want to do this. - Amber? I can not live without you. - Amber. Who wants wine? This will be a long night. - A donut? We will arrest them? Yes, that seems like a suspect. Well, there we go look around. I want you filming everything, Davey. - That's no problem. Why look at your cameras? If it breaks down, then I have a backup. What are you crazy? Hey man, nice party. - Has she danced? No, not yet. - It is a show that I tell you. Okay, this is it. I'm going to murder anyone. Yes, get ready for the massacre and violence ... Shoot him, Kenneth. That looks good, man. The suspect has been arrested. Hello. - Hello, how are you? Do you want some food? - No, thank you. Besides, I met someone. - What now? You do that soon. - He's cute. He's cute. - Fun, what should you get to him? About 18 cm. Come, let's go upstairs. - What? To fuck. - Maybe we can stay a while? Come on, are you still a virgin? Yes, something like that. - Are you coming? Jas. - Hello. Welcome. - You look beautiful. You too. - Thank you. Hello. - Hello darling, I love watching you. Where is James? - He gets some action. In my bed? - Come on, Ash. He deflowered, have mercy. We are going to fuck. I have to pee. You screwed up everything, you fucking thief. - Shut up. What's this? So what is the story for us? - The story? So, how will it end? - Well, I thought ... that we will probably divorce and marry someone else. and then one day, I see you again ... and I think, where you were all this time? Why do we marry someone else? A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end. Arch, you have between meet other people. You can not meet someone and end with those. Because I want to finish with you. Where are you going? - In the toilet, is that allowed? No. Do not look at me. I'm a little rosy, I want a drink. - You take this, I'll get a drink. Help.
