The Palace of the West? You're going to confine me there? - Yes, sire - No! I refuse to leave here I shall remain here Here, at least I can listen to the sounds of the city... ...and there are many distractions to console me in my solitude Go tell the Emperor that Tell my son... ...not to cause his old father any further suffering But it is the Emperor's order We must carry out his imperial order to the letter Please, make yourself ready to leave You insult me! Get out! Out! Out! Kuei-fei... Kuei-fei... Where are you, my love? Are you watching over me from somewhere beyond the grave? Alas, I am too old now... ... for any pleasures this world may offer me I wish only to see you again Any place without your presence... ... is unbearable to me Kuei-fei... ... where are you? Well done. You all played very well I wasn't too sure of the piece at first... ...but I very much enjoyed your rendition I think it is one of Your Majesty's masterpieces However, there is a certain underlying sadness to it, sire How can you expect me to compose anything joyous, the way I feel? Majesty, you are the most fortunate person in the Empire Look at me, do I really seem that fortunate? Fortune is not a mere corollary of one's social status If I were truly fortunate... ...then I would be able to compose more joyous pieces of music This piece was composed in honour of my late wife Well... let us play the next movement Your Majesty... ...Premier Li wishes for an audience with you... ...to discuss pressing affairs of state And as your schedule must be strictly observed... ...I must ask you kindly to finish now for today Thank you, everybody Wait I just want to try this last piece Premier Li, you can wait a little longer I fear I cannot, Majesty Besides myself, you are to address several foreign ambassadors, sire We also have to plan your journey details Affairs of state must always take precedence, sire You constantly interfere with my pleasures... ...and bind me to ridiculous schedules and ceremonies! You distract His Majesty from his duties of governance Get out! - Majesty... - What is it? Please look at this statue of the Bodhisattva... ...that came in tribute from the Silla Kingdom of Korea She is truly a work of great beauty And who is this? You honour me by giving her recognition, Majesty I have taken the liberty of selecting this highly capable lady... ...to take care of all your needs, sire It's unnecessary Nobody can take the place of the late Empress Just forget about it I heard that His Majesty turned her down Did he refuse you? It wasn't your fault We may be the most beautiful women in the capital... ...but we're just not beautiful enough for His Imperial Majesty, that's all! You just have to accept your fate with good grace Oh, welcome, sire! General An Lu-shan has arrived! Welcome Oh, welcome, sire What a shame. I really thought your daughter would be accepted She failed, despite all your intercessions on our behalf What a shame That's put an end to all our plans, General Not so. All is not lost yet Her acceptance would have hastened things along, that's all All our hopes are dashed She's the third sister to be rejected I'll end up working here and never getting on in life General, please take me with you to your fortress - And what would you do there? - But I've no future here in the capital I'd rather be an official under you, General... ...then I could take bribes and get rich quick! You sound desperate, and I don't hire such desperate men I'll worry about it later. General, let's have a drink - Good - Come right this way - Let's drink - You go on ahead... What's up with you? Look lively! Master Kao will be arriving soon. Let's go Even on the branches of the willows Throughout the town... Hey, the guests have arrived! Stop that singing! - Who is she? - She's my youngest cousin Same family as the others? She's their half-sister. A country girl, just arrived from the mountains - General? - Wait... So, you're a daughter of the Yang family? I'm more like their servant Hey! Show me your face Please leave me alone, I have work to do Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing to me? What...? You're quite a beauty Let go of me! You're wasted here in the kitchen General! What are you doing in this place? - I've just found a real treasure - What? This one, here! That was a real shame your daughter was rejected No, not at all, one can't expect the daughter of a mere restaurateur... ...to attract the attention of His Majesty It was our fault for thinking above our station What do you mean, brother, that it was our fault? You want to run this restaurant for the rest of your life? Well, I don't! I want to be someone and get on in life! I just think differently from you You want to use your daughters to further your own ambitions What's wrong with that? I'm doing it for the honour of the Yang Family For the prosperity of the whole family I'm only doing the right thing No, your motives are evil... Stop - Let me see how you look in these - No! Don't answer back! Put them on quickly! If I put those on, everyone will just laugh at me! What a child! Come here I'm just a country peasant Since my mother died, I've been forced to work as a maid in the kitchens You treat me worse than a dog! Everyone has to start somewhere Take me for instance, my father was a foreigner in this country I suffered enormous prejudice and was maltreated as a child But human beings have a destiny... ...and if you don't grasp at good fortune then you'll regret it for life Don't you see, you have been presented with a wonderful opportunity? Right then, try these robes on And then what? We're going to see where your destiny lies You've never realised how beautiful you are? No, not at all Well, it's up to me to convince you otherwise But you must be aware of your beauty, before you can convince others to see it Yes? Get dressed quickly Follow the General's kind advice and put this robe on Others may envy us... ...but our low birth stops us from progressing further Is it only the Li family that can gain advancement? There's nothing we can do about it for the present No one can stand in the way of Premier Li Lin-fu It's unfortunate the Emperor wasn't attracted to your daughter He can't forget the late Empress Wu-hui, can he? She was a wonderful Empress There could be no other like her in this world Yes, there could be, Master Kao! There could be another Wu-hui! You're not the only one who wishes to see Empress Wu-hui reincarnated Those who support the Emperor wish it, too - Another Empress Wu-hui, you say? - Yes, another. See for yourself It's Yu-huan, isn't it? She's beautiful You're such fools! How could you hide such a jewel in your kitchens? Who is this? My youngest cousin, Yu-huan From here, we're heading for the convent on Mount Li I will ask the Mother Abbess to present you to His Majesty's court She is a relative of the Emperor and he trusts her implicitly Master Kao is already there waiting for us At last, our luck is going to change I have no doubt that you will attract the Emperor's attention As a reward for finding you... ...I will be called back to the capital in triumph and made a minister And as the highest ranking concubine, you shall enjoy a most glorious life You must take full advantage of the fact that you were born beautiful What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Don't you understand, if you become an imperial concubine... ...great status and honour will be bestowed upon all your family? And I will simply become a tool for the family to use... ...just as I was when I was forced to work in their kitchens Not at all! This is for your own happiness Our rewards will be a mere fraction of yours You must understand that Everything will turn out just fine... Just fine So, from this point onwards... ...everything about your past will be extinguished What do you think of her, Mother Abbess? A lovely girl - Everything is prepared, madam - This girl is your servant She will obey your every whim Please allow me to show you to your room Do you think she will be to the Emperor's liking? Mother Abbess... Just as you recommended Wu-hui as a wife for the Emperor... ...I would like to propose her suitability as an imperial consort Do you think the Emperor trusts you more than he does me? I'm not saying that at all. I mean... Master Kao... ...do you have any idea how much the Emperor trusts my judgement? - Of course I do, but... - Then be silent! Yes, madam It was I who instructed the Empress Wu-hui And I will mould this girl in the same way You will see, I will make her worthy of the Emperor Yes, madam His Majesty has arrived He's walking in the Plum Tree Garden I've been told to fetch you, it's time for you to meet him Do you think I'll be all right dressed like this? You look very beautiful If I am not to the Emperor's liking... ...I'll end up being confined to his harem... ...to live out the rest of my days You mustn't concern yourself with such things I think the Emperor will be amazed when he sees how beautiful you are What kind of a man is the Emperor? What kind of things does he like? How did Wu-hui manage to capture his heart? Please tell me The Emperor is a very kind-hearted person And he greatly appreciates people who show sincerity The more you listen to his music, the more you will understand him I see... It is time for you to take some tea, Majesty I'm enjoying looking at the plum blossoms, I don't want any tea But your physician has given strict instructions, Majesty Why do you all constantly try to impede me? You don't even allow me to enjoy my leisure as I wish Please do not chastise me, Majesty... ...I am simply following the strict rules of court etiquette Please, if you would kindly make your way to the tea house... Your Majesty... Even in the distance, the plum blossoms look so beautiful It's not only the plum blossom that is beautiful... ...there is also a beautiful girl in full blossom, Majesty I would like to express the colour and scent of the plum blossoms in music I would like to be left alone this evening, please Thank you. You may go now You are dismissed Master Kao, why are you still here? Your Majesty, I understand your grief at the loss of Empress Wu-hui... ...but to continue mourning her like this... I'm in no mood to listen to your sermons this evening I asked you to leave me alone this evening. Understand? Yes, sire I would like to be left alone to reminisce about my late Empress Who are you? Who allowed you into my private chambers? I know... This must be Kao's doing Because I talk so much of my late wife... ...he has taken it upon himself to bring me a woman who looks like her Your resemblance to Wu-hui is uncanny However, it is not her body that I yearn for, but her spirit Majesty... No one can replace Wu-hui Please don't destroy my memories I wish you to go now Isn't that the piece I composed in the Plum Tree Garden? You play very well Very well indeed Did you learn to play that piece to impress me? Or did you play it simply to show me how clever you are? Not at all, Your Majesty Why did you play it, then? I merely wanted to soothe and comfort your poor heart, Majesty... ...if only for a short moment My poor heart? Majesty... ...I did not enter your court of my own free will Others will be delighted if my presence here pleases you It has nothing to do with me... ...it is the will of those that brought me here I am like their puppet and they pull my strings I thought I'd have to spend the rest of my life here... ...like some ornament at Your Majesty's side There was nothing I could do but accept the inevitability of my destiny But then... ...when I realised how much love Your Majesty still felt for Wu-hui... ...I felt ashamed of myself Empress Wu-hui was a very fortunate person indeed I never imagined... ...that a woman could be so loved by a man I envy Wu-hui If only I could meet a man who was as gentle and kind as Your Majesty... ...then I would be happy I shall take my leave of you, sire Wait a moment Up until now, I believed only Wu-hui could bring happiness into my life But you... ...of your own accord, played my composition... ...and gave me great comfort Moreover, you have asked for no reward Above all... ...you spoke to me with honesty, as you would address any other person Not even Wu-hui was ever able to do that Tell me what your name is I am Yu-huan of the Yang family, Your Majesty Yu-huan, from now on I wish you to remain close at my side... ...as a friend Only if you wish, of course Yes, sire I would like that very much That settles it. You agree to stay at my side? I take that as a promise Tomorrow morning... ...I want you to prepare the hot spring in the Lotus Pool for Yu-huan Lady Yu-huan... ...since Empress Wu-hui passed away... ...you are the first to have been allowed to use the Lotus Pool His Majesty says that spring has returned to the court! I can't stay long. I have to leave tomorrow It's unfortunate that I have to return to my old life as a provincial governor... ...without seeing how Yu-huan is getting along Does my presence here embarrass you? Please, General... ...a governorship is an honourable post What use is a provincial governorship? I want a position in the capital If Li Lin-fu falls from power, who will be the next premier? Do you have your sights set on being premier, General? One must be ambitious and aim high, for the premiership... ...or even the imperial throne! The throne? You just watch, your little kitchen help may one day become Empress You're right... Anything is possible I will never abandon my ambitions If Yu-huan becomes influential, you won't remain here much longer General, it seems she's already been accepted as his mistress Being one of his harem means nothing The important thing is for Yu-huan to rise above the other women in status The future of the Yang family depends on it Don't forget that, Chao! In accordance with the law, sire, it is dictated that Lady Cheng must die I have no recollection of issuing such an order You are the servants of a prisoner! How dare you presume to speak in front of His Imperial Majesty! Get out! Out! It is strictly forbidden by imperial decree for any lady in your harem... ...to involve herself in matters of governance Therefore the penalty for such a crime is death But Lady Cheng only involved herself in politics... ...because she wanted to secure a government post for her relative I am only observing a law that you yourself decreed, Your Majesty But laws should be made to safeguard the well-being of the people Why can't you use the law for the benefit of the people? If Your Majesty should care to make such laws... ...then I will faithfully carry them out However, I must insist that if a law... Enough! I have no wish to listen to you Your Majesty... I thought that you had the power to do anything that you wished For years, I was able to do as I pleased in all matters But the laws and codes of practice that I myself made now constrain me... ...and the result is a curtailment of my powers Sometimes it is important to relax and forget all your troubles Forget all my troubles? Let me accompany you, Your Majesty - Where to? - Into the city This evening there is an annual festival, and the whole city will be celebrating Festival of Lanterns Hold on to me tightly so I don't lose you, sire There are servants from the court approaching This way That was a narrow escape Is it all right to remove my hood? It's so uncomfortable I'm sure we'll be fine here - How kind of you, sire - These are for me? Many thanks. Please, accept these Won't you try one? Try it Tonight, you must do exactly as I tell you It's delicious, isn't it? I'm not sure Everybody is so kind This is the first time in a long time that I've felt so free Aren't you glad you ventured out? These sweets are very tasty Now you see! We can't allow a pair of lovers to pass through - Why not? - You have to drink before you can pass - I don't want to trouble you - You're not troubling us! Have a drink! Please forgive their impertinence Let's celebrate your wedding! - One more! - One more! First we drink, then we dance! Your dancing was wonderful Why did you never dance for me before? Well, it was the beautiful sound of your lute that made me want to dance Your movements kept perfect timing Only because Your Majesty matched my tempo I've had a marvellous evening I feel so refreshed that my blood is tingling It makes me so happy to hear you say that This evening, I don't feel like an emperor... ...I feel like a man of the people, you can call me Li San-lan! Me, too. I'm Yu-huan, just a simple peasant girl Majesty... May we have some tea, please? Careful, it's hot Here You know... ...it feels like I've lived here with you for years and years! As our governor-generals, it is your responsibility to defend our borders... ...against the invading barbarians For a long time they have been troublesome and war seems inevitable But it is important to win them over not by force but by diplomacy It will all depend on your abilities His Majesty is relying on you completely, generals... ...and each of you is expected to fulfil his duty I hope you enjoy this gathering... ...that His Majesty has arranged in your honour Well, if it isn't General An Lu-shan... Welcome to the capital Well, Chao... You must call me by the new name and title that His Majesty gave me So, you're Minister Yang Kuo-chung now, are you? Close to the throne. A lofty position indeed Damn these upstart women! They live in luxury, all paid for with our taxes They're just taking advantage of His Majesty's love for Kuei-fei They're jumped-up servants who think they're better than the rest of us Make way for Her Ladyship! Move! Move! Move, you bastard! What do you think you're doing? What are you doing? The Yang family has corrupted the whole court! Death to the Yangs! Don't just stand there! Quickly, to the palace! Kill them! - Death to the Yangs! - Kill them all! - Down with the Yangs! - Kill them! Kill the Yangs! - What's happened? - What's happened, madam? On the way here, we were attacked by a mob... ...and they were shouting, "Death to the Yang family!" How frightening for you How dare they treat friends of His Majesty this way! They're ruffians! Were they arrested? Our guards just stood by and watched them abuse us! You were all useless! Someone must take responsibility for this! I apologise, madam. What were the guards doing? Are you all right, madam? What about Kuei-fei? What happened? Kuei-fei... Are you hurt? You were right when you said one should be ambitious and aim high And you have been made governor of three provinces You must be pleased with your progress That's nothing compared to your promotion, Minister And to whom do you attribute your success? I attribute it to my own prowess It certainly hasn't been easy, though Don't talk nonsense! It's all due to Kuei-fei And Kuei-fei, in turn, owes all she has to me! Listen, Chao... Promote me to a central government post and make me a minister Only the Emperor has the authority to do that, not me So arrange for Kuei-fei to make a request to His Majesty It is forbidden for women to have any involvement in politics Listen to me, Chao... ...I have now consolidated my power base in the north You'd be wise to retain my friendship if you wish to remain in power - Minister? - What is it? Would you ask His Majesty what music he'd like the musicians to play next? I will consider what you have just said, General Does Your Majesty have any particular music you'd like to hear next? Let me see... I know... ...in honour of my new governors... ...I shall play for them myself It has been a long time, madam Congratulations on your new post, General I don't see it as any cause for celebration I still nurture my ambition for a government post in the capital Yu-huan... Listen to me... You have become a very influential concubine at court I want to be a government minister... ...and I have the right to expect your help on this matter General, please... not here What? So, you won't even deign to listen to what I have to say? Are you too selfish to think of anyone but yourself? Look how your three sisters have risen through the ranks Even Chao has been rewarded with a ministerial post Why, then, must I languish in the provinces? Please don't raise your voice - Excuse me - Wait! You really are exquisitely beautiful I never thought you could look this radiant If only I had taken you for my own that day we first met... ...both our destinies would be very different now Yu-huan... What are you doing? I belong to the Emperor now What do you mean, "belong to the Emperor"? You mustn't forget, Yu-huan... ...it was I who took you away from the drudgery of life in the kitchen And has His Majesty not generously rewarded you for your efforts? Some reward, indeed! Yu-huan... Surely you've heard that the people are cursing the Yang family? Do you not see how the nation suffers under a heavy taxation system... ...while Chao abuses his position and lines his own pockets? And your three sisters lead a life of ostentatious decadence The people may revolt at any moment... ...and when they do, it'll be the Yang family they'll be after If it goes on like this, even the Emperor's life may be in danger Even the Emperor was once nothing more than a provincial warlord Fortune favours the mighty... ...and any mighty feudal lord can make himself Emperor! Listen, Yu-huan... My future is as boundless as an ocean Why don't you accompany me to my fortress? This is the only way you can save yourself now Kuei-fei! Kuei-fei, His Majesty has finished his recital now But why are you telling me this all of a sudden? Tell me the reason The whole nation seems to be burning with rage at the Yang family Please let me return to my former life as Yu-huan... ...and discharge my cousin Kuo-chung and my three sisters from the court Your three sisters are of no consequence And as for promoting Kuo-chung to a ministerial position... ...I have my own ulterior motive for doing that I would never be foolish enough to allow my feelings for you... ...to jeopardise the governance of the country I'm not thinking of just Your Majesty's safety... ...but for the safety of the whole country Wait! Kuei-fei... ...I am sure that you are aware of the consequences... ...if a consort involves herself in the affairs of the state Of course I am aware, sire Therefore, please punish me as you see fit Are you saying that you have no compunction about leaving me? Perhaps I have committed a crime... ...and I am no longer worthy of the title of consort Are you so willing to listen to what others have to say rather than me? The other evening... ...the whole court knew that you were talking alone with An Lu-shan Majesty, you must trust me, please But you are still determined to leave me? Please forgive me! Enough! Master Kao! Take Kuei-fei to the harem immediately But Your Majesty... Do as I command! Premier Li... what is it you want? Majesty... I heard that you have dismissed Kuei-fei I must say, Your Majesty, that I admire your decision and congratulate you Is that all you came to say? Yes, sire Kuo-chung, I hear you've been taking advantage of my illness... ...and have been acting as though you were the Premier All with the blessing of His Majesty Surely you should be considering retirement You're too infirm to deal with the pressures of being Premier I'll see that you receive notification of discharge of your duties I won't hear such insolence! Silence! Your Majesty, Kuei-fei refused to enter the harem... ...but went to the house of her cousin Yang Hsien What? It's unacceptable for such a noble lady of the court... ...to stay in the house of a commoner On your orders, I shall go and find her We will bring her back immediately, sire I'm so glad that you have come back here It's better for your sisters and for Chao as well You can remain here as long as you wish I will protect you with my life But what are your plans for the future? I wish to become Yu-huan once again You rose too high too quickly... ...that was your misfortune There are many and varied ways... ... to live a good life The province where I was born... ... is where I yearn to return As they hang on the frame over the door... ... the grapes are ripening The sun is high in the sky... When did you arrive here from the provinces? - Last year - Really? - Do you like it here? - Yes Kuei-fei, what are you doing in such a filthy place? Master Kao and I have come to take you back to the palace I wish to see no one But the Emperor himself has sent us His Majesty ordered us to bring you back immediately Please get ready as quickly as possible Your palanquin is waiting I will not go back I prefer to stay here This is all your fault, Hsien You should be worried about your own future! The people of Chang'an are after your blood! It's impossible for a politician to please everyone Consider how you have lorded it over the whole nation You should resign from your post. It is her wish also What do you know about anything? She is concerned for you! Don't be so insolent! - You damn upstart! - What? Someone help me! What insolence! We cannot just stand by idly and watch our country fall! We must destroy the Yang family and save the empire! By favouring the Yangs, His Majesty must also share some of the blame! It is time to usher in a new era! The nation must have a new ruler! Our objective is to take the capital, Chang'an! Onwards to the capital! In an attempt to destroy the Tangs and usurp the imperial throne... ... General An Lu-shan heads a revolution Giving himself the title Emperor Taien... ... he advances with his army toward the capital, Chang'an Learning of the perils now threatening the life of Emperor Hs?an-tsung... ... Kuei-fei decides to return to him immediately... ... to be by his side and face their fate together Despite the many dangers, she remains resolute and unafraid Emperor Hs?an-tsung flees the capital, and after an arduous journey... ... they rest in Mukuai, a desolate village Let me do this for you You go and see to His Majesty No, I'll prepare it He looks exhausted. Take this to him quickly Yes, madam Forgive me, I'm afraid this is all we can serve you, Majesty And what about my men? Aren't they hungry, too? They'll be fed soon I see... No! What's happening? Look, men! We've killed the three Yang sisters! We've killed each one of them! The people demanded their execution! Listen, why did we flee from the capital without putting up a fight? We Imperial Guards are a disgrace! General An's forces are growing in strength! Everyone who's anti-government is joining his ranks! They're angry with the politicians Kuo-chung and Kao! We have no ill-feeling towards His Imperial Majesty! It was for His Majesty's sake that we executed the three Yang sisters! General An isn't our enemy, it's the Yang family! The next to be executed will be Yang Kuo-chung and Kao Li-hsi! Commander, we must leave as soon as the men have eaten General An has crossed the river and is advancing on Cheng-Tu Understood, sir What are you doing? Prepare to move out! What's going on? It is Premier Yang Kuo-chung who is to blame for all this Unless he's punished, the troops won't move an inch! Silence! Who's the ringleader? I want his head! It's a unanimous decision We decided to kill the three Yang sisters as a blood sacrifice You're powerless to stand in our way now - Seize him! - No... no! Back, you insolent fools! Kill Kuo-chung! Kuei-fei... I regret having caused you so much hardship Being here alone with you... ...it reminds me of that night we spent during the Festival of Lanterns The memories are comforting to me It heartens me to see you so cheerful, Majesty It takes a lot more than this to cause me despair What is it? It's terrible Kuo-chung and the three Yang sisters were seized by the enemy... - What? ...and they have been executed Kuo-chung and the three sisters? The situation is beyond my control, Majesty Please strip me of my title, sire - What for? - We are being besieged, sire Why? Is this a revolt against me? The army is not disloyal to you, sire Majesty... You see... Kuei-fei... What about Kuei-fei? Well... Kuei-fei, would you leave us a moment...? Wait! Why can't Kuei-fei remain here? Your Majesty, please excuse me Kuei-fei! Master Kao, what is it you wish to tell me without Kuei-fei present? The executions of Kuo-chung and the three sisters... ...have not appeased the people Your Majesty, the soldiers are demanding the life of Kuei-fei - What? They want Kuei-fei? - Yes, sire Never! Never! Women of the harem have no responsibility for affairs of state However, I have to say that under the circumstances... ...she is considered a member of the Yang family, sire Kao... do you intend to betray us? Was it not you who recommended Kuei-fei to me? And now you intend to kill her? Majesty... your life is in danger! We must make a decision to save you and the nation Silence! What do you mean, to save me and the nation? Have you ever considered your country before now? You're just trying to save your own skin! No, Your Majesty, no! The soldiers are baying for blood... ...they've lost all reason, they're going berserk! Majesty! What are you doing? The soldiers are demanding your life first, Kao! - What? No! - You're a traitor and must die! Forgive me, sire, for spilling blood in your presence I will pay the penalty, sire Never mind about that I must speak to the troops Please wait! - You must hand over Kuei-fei! - We are loyal to you, sire! Wait! Calm yourselves down Listen to what I have to say... Kuei-fei! ...Kuei-fei is blameless Majesty, Kuei-fei is from the Yang family Your life is in danger, sire. It is for your own safety You must make a decision quickly, Majesty! All of you have been so attentive to me over the years Pray for the quick restoration of peace and the return of His Majesty to power I am praying for the return of a peaceful springtime... ...when the beautiful plum trees will once again blossom... ...and people can celebrate the Festival of Lanterns I pray with all my heart that those days arrive soon Hung-tao... Please give this to His Majesty from me Tell him... ...that I shall always and forever be by his side - Will you tell him that? - Yes, madam - You must come with us - Prepare yourself! Let us proceed Kuei-fei... Kuei-fei... Will peace now be restored to my nation? After you passed away... ... there was nothing left for me in this world General An Lu-shan soon met his demise... ... but by then... ... my imperial throne had been usurped... ... by my very own son, the Crown Prince He was no different from An Lu-shan after all There was never any love lost between us What a heartless world we live in Kuei-fei... Kuei-fei... Majesty... ... I have come to take you away with me Oh, Kuei-fei? I have been waiting for this moment for many years Finally, the day has come Give me your hand, Majesty Let me guide you I have waited so long for this We'll be together forever now. I'll never let you leave my side Majesty... no one can ever tear us asunder this time Now we can be truly happy Yes, truly happy And our happiness shall know no end I can see you smiling now, my dearest The End
