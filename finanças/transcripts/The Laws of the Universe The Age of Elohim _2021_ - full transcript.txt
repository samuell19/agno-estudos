150 million years ago, Lord Elohim descended to Earth. It was the second time since His descent 330 million years ago when He taught the Original Law as Lord Alpha. Back then, a lower spirit World had been formed on Earth and some could not return to heaven. Also, various species had come from space, causing conflicts. As the world began to divide itself into light and darkness, Lord Elohim stood at the front line, protecting Earth from the attacks of evil aliens. And now, humans are about to face an unprecedented crisis. Humans, know good and evil on Earth. The Laws of the Universe â€”The Age of Elohim Lady Panguru, we have a situation. Seraphim, what is it? A large meteorite is approaching Earth faster than we can ever imagine. A meteorite? It's heading toward us as if it has a mind of its own. We don't have much time till it hits us. It will crash into Earth if we don't stop it. We must report this to Lord Elohim! Stay calm! Evacuate to the basement! A meteorite is coming! Everyone! Prepare maximum defenses. We must protect Lord Elohim and our people! Why? Why can't our beam destroy that meteorite? We won't make it! Ah Ah Ah â€”! Ah Ah Ah â€”! Ah Ah Ah â€”! O Oh! O Oh! Oh â€”! O Oh! O Oh! Oh â€”! I'm here, I'm here I'm here on Earth What did I come here for? I surely came to Win the fight Win it! Win it! Win it! Win it! Yaizael! Win it! Yaizael! Win it! You are invincible! You can beat any space aliens! You're not scared of Dinosaurs on Earth! You're not scared of Demons on Earth! You're not scared of Animals on Earth! You're not scared of human beings! Go Go! Yaizael! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go on! Go on! Go on! Go on! Go on! You are...? My name is Yaizael. I've come upon Lord Elohim's request. Yaizael? The commander-in-chief of the Galactic Federation? She was in charge of the ironclad defense of our sister star Vega. Now that I'm here, the enemy won't touch this planet. So, Lord Elohim invited you... Lord Heem. Lord Heem. Lord Heem... Lord Heem of the gracious star Vega. Lord Heem. Earth is facing grave danger. Queen of Vega, send Yaizael to Earth. The God of the Earth, Elohim! Someone, bring Yaizael here immediately. Your Highness, you wanted to see me? Yaizael. We have to send you to Earth earlier than we planned. To Earth? But what about Vega's security? Don't worry about that. Leave it to us. Right now, the great Lord Elohim's birthplace Earth is facing grave danger. Earth is in danger? As you know, the God of the Earth Elohim and Vega's Lord Heem are both incarnations of the Primordial Buddha of the universe, born to guide us. So, the Earth people are our kin. If Earth perishes, we will lose our spiritual training ground in the solar system, and lose our chance to learn from the Primordial Buddha of the universe. I understand. If Lord Elohim is requesting my assistance, I am ready to go on a mission right away. Thank you. I'll grant you Vega's sacred treasure. Please use this to protect Earth. What's this? It's Vega's sacred sword that changes its shape as necessary. And... Here's Vega's crystal and the mirror of change. These are Vega's sacred treasures filled with our teachings Use them well. The righteous must be strong. The strong must deepen love. Lord Heem. Vega's secret teachings are harmony and change. On top of that, if you can gain deeper wisdom from the God of the Earth. Yaizael, then, you'll be invincible. We're about to leave Vega, and jump to Earth where Lord Elohim is. Three, two, one... What's that? A huge meteorite! It's so close to Earth... Ready to shoot! Fire! What? It's not working! The meteorite is going into the atmosphere! It's gonna hit Earth! Commander Yaizael?! Elohim, Elohim, Elohim Why did you come here again? Elohim, Elohim, Elohim What is your new Teachings in this age? The Earth is a blue and beautiful planet With many animals There are various ethnic leaders Who governed each race and each language My Lord, Yaizael is here. To teach them the Supreme Truth of God My Lord, Yaizael is here. I, Yaizael, am here upon Lord Elohim's request. All the way I pledge to devote myself to the future of this beautiful Earth. You came here I pledge to devote myself to the future of this beautiful Earth. Yaizael, I'm glad to see you here. A long, long time ago Work together with others to protect Earth. Oh yes, definitely You're the Lord of this planet Elohim, when we call the name of God When we call the name of the Lord We know absolutely You would be there in the end That meteorite couldn't be destroyed by any ordinary force. So it was most likely a meteorite bomb that had been tampered with. A meteorite bomb... Someone behind all this might come back for a larger attack. Where exactly was it launched from? We're still investigating. But it's likely from the Centaurus Beta. We've been engaged in a war recently. I see. I'm also thinking about the possibility of an accomplice. In any case, what power did you use to destroy the meteorite, Yaizael? I think because of this sacred sword of Vega. Isn't that the treasure sword that can transform its shape? Only the chosen ones of Vega can use the legendary sword. The queen of Vega has given me other treasures too. She told me to use these well for Earth. This is Vega's crystal, and the mirror of change. The three sacred treasures! The crystal will be useful after figuring out how to adapt it to Earth. We'll let Stanleeman do the research. This is a rare crystal. I've never seen this on Earth. Could it be used to make a weapon for Earth? Well...I'll have to think about what it could be used for. But what treasures Vega has! I'm thinking this crystal chooses its owner. "Chooses its owner?" Vega's sacred treasures are not for personal fulfillment. They only work when they're used for others' happiness to realize justice in tune with God's Will. If Earthlings were to use this, they have to be the ones who have a strong sense of justice and self-sacrifice. Yaizael, you might not be aware of this, but aren't you entitled to use them? Of course, it's God's Will to defeat evil and promote good. I'll never fight if it's not for justice. Yaizael. To survive this crisis on Earth, we're recruiting new soldiers. And I would like you to train them to be an elite troop and ready for the next battle. Consider it done. I'm Yaizael and I'll lead the training from today. You'll be trained under my rules. Everyone, work hard and learn well. Hey, she's just a young lady. Hey cutie. Doesn't that armor give you sore shoulders? I have been ordered by Lord Elohim to lead the army. You two. You should know it's a huge mistake to judge people by their appearances. Also... your mind is who you truly are. With a wandering mind and a heart full of fear, you'll lose in a second! You must first commit to what you're fighting for! She's right! Under Lord Elohim's rule, we're determined to fight against all evil. We will protect our beloved Earth. Who are you? I'm sorry. I'm Ladimir. I'm a commander in the Elohim army. Commander Yaizael, if you need help training them, I'm here to assist you. Thank you, Ladimir. I see there are some Earthlings I can talk to. I appreciate it. And you can just call me Yaizael. I'm glad to be acquainted. Likewise, Yaizael. Well, let's begin our training! First, let's start with lining up. Sir! The meteorite bomb we launched was destroyed by someone! "Destroyed?" But it was made of dark matter and supposedly the strongest meteorite! Yes, Sir... Can't believe this! Earth is just a small planet we should be able to colonize right away. Sorry to hear the news, Great General Evol. Dahar I took your advice and made a meteorite bomb with dark matter. But the Earthlings destroyed it! There's no way Earthlings are that powerful. But I guess the God of the Earth is well-connected in the universe. Is someone from another star defending Earth? I told you that I'll give you Earth. But it's not happening so easily. Isn't that frustrating? Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Now that you're in this, don't you wanna ruin Earth with me? I can help you. So this is Earth in the age of Lord Elohim. Hi! Aren't you the one who saved Earth the other day? Now that I'm here, I'll give my life to protect your planet. Awesome! You're a hero on Earth. People have told me, but... this sure is a beautiful planet. Some of the aliens who came to Earth are frustrated by the cultural differences between Earthlings' and their own. Do you mean the Reptilians who only recognize the strong? Some of them do become friends with Earthlings. Some reincarnate in Earthlings' flesh and try hard to accept differences as the God of the Earth teaches. I heard that Earthlings are subject to the law of reincarnation. So, space people can reincarnate as Earthlings? That's right. When we complete our lifetime, we return to the spirit world and are reborn into this world for spiritual training. But some people on Earth blindly believe that this world is the only world that exists, and spoil themselves. C'mon! Are you OK? Hey! Shame on you! What's going on? Oh, Commander Yaizael! We finished today's training, so we wanted to let off steam. Right. Life's not worth it if it's not fun. What's your problem? You fools! Earth is facing a grave danger right now! You are fighters of Lord Elohim's Army! But...we've just joined, so we thought we're allowed to have some fun. Even if you're new, belonging to Lord Elohim's army means you'll be seen as Lord Elohim's direct subordinates by the people. Er...yes. The soldiers of God must be heroes in everyone's eyes. Even in private, your behaviors shouldn't disappoint people. Yes, Ma'am... Can't believe this. I need to train the new guys' minds first. Lady Panguru. I see some Earthlings are calm, while others are aggressive. Some lead an undisciplined life. Why are they allowed to exist? Look. The God of the Earth has been accepting unique races, guiding them by providing a place for spiritual training. But now, some are living against His Will. They reside in the lower spiritual world and can't return to heaven. What kind are they? It's those who left this world full of fear because they were in a war against a violent race. Some can't believe in the invisible world, and indulge in worldly pleasures. They're the reason Lord Elohim is trying to set a standard of what's good and what's evil on Earth. Lord Elohim. Please teach us what's good and what's evil... ...and Earth's justice. Lord Elohim. Thank you for giving us a sermon. What is that? What exactly is Earth's justice that Lord Elohim teaches? We should all listen well too. We have a situation. Unknown bioenergy is approaching from outer space. That might be... the mastermind behind the meteorite bomb. Oh no... That meteorite was already a huge threat to Earth. How can we defend this planet this time? Calm yourself, Boon. As a leader, you must do your best to lead the Andromedan Army. How is Stanleeman doing with the weapon? He's still working on it. There's no choice. We'll gather our troops, the Andromedan Army, and Earthlings who can fight. What's that black hole? We need a wall! All forces, ready for defense! Form a wall! Don't give in to fear! Follow me! Andromedan fighters, be strong! Hi Yaizael. Didn't think you'd be on Earth in this day and age. I won't be easy on you just because you're a girl. Dahar...I knew it! I truly despise your kind. Uh-oh. What do you have there? You've got good-for-nothing Reptilians. What a shame... Reptilians are supposed to be tough! But now you're working under a girl? I wonder why Elohim doesn't recognize your power and resilience. Don't listen to Dahar! We are serving Lord Elohim as Earthlings with pride and dignity. Is that so? The strong shall rule over the weak; That's the order of universe. DO HOT underestimate me. Becoming one with the Lord makes me the strongest commander in the universe. She is...transformed? Dahar! Not bad. But think about it. ls what you are doing truly worth it? In the great universe, there are ways to be more powerful. But Elohim taught you equality and such and made you all weaklings. That's... You, Reptilians. Did you know your friends are locked up in the dark world after they died? Isn't that unfair? They just enjoyed their life to the fullest. Is it that bad to live for your own personal fulfillment? Elohim isn't accepting you for who you are. Rather, He hates you. Otherwise, why would He treat you like this? Quiet! Lord Elohim will never abandon any soul! Stop! Uh Uh Uh â€” Uh Uh Uh â€” Uh Uh Uh Uh â€” Uh Uh Uh Uh â€” Devil, get away! Devil, get away! From a faraway universe As I arrived You are...! At this planet You areâ€œ).! At this planet Lord, I'm here now. Amor! It was full of hatred Amer'.! It was full of hatred Why are you here? Why are you here? And rage Andrage True strength comes from believing in eternal life and in God. True strength comes from believing in eternal life and in God. It comes from loving others even if it costs you your life. I came down I came down Nonsense'.! Nonsense! Into this storm Nonsense'.! Into this storm Has the Lord you believe in ever given you anything? / fought Has the Lord you believe in ever given you anything? I fought / fought Hey, if your Lord is real, He should do something for us too Hey, if your Lord is real, He should do something for us too For the people For the people For the people Do not test our Lord. Do not test our Lord. To liberate them Do not test our Lord. To liberate them To liberate them To liberate them Yes, sir! Yes, sir! From the Yoke of their sufferings This is Jesus Jesus of the Beginning It's the beginning I'm impressed! Retreat for now! Do you believe in the Lord? Y...yes. I believe in Him. Lord, please show your mercy, love, and heal his wounds. It's a miracle! We almost didn't make it if it weren't for Master Amor. I'm a good fighter but I couldn't lead my army. I've had no hesitation in destroying evil. Ultimately, that attitude is similar to what Dahar believes. Do not test our Lord. Do I lack love? What is Earth's way of justice? I want to learn. Here on Earth, I want to learn Lord Elohim's Will. We must prepare to take action against Dahar's dark matter. About that. After examining the fragments from the meteorite, they found out that it was made of dark matter. Dark matter? So, is Dahar behind all this? Yes. Centaurus Beta likely obtained the dark matter from Dahar, and made the weapon using their high technology. I see. Centaurus Beta's mother ship must be severely damaged from our all-out attack. I assumed they wouldn't recover for a while. But they're attacking Earth so vigorously. The Elohim Army needs to quickly regain its strength and prepare for the next attack. You are... I saw you earlier. Oh. You must be the Galactic Federation's commander from Vega. I'm Michael. I've come to save Earth along with Master Amor. I am Yaizael. You saved us earlier. I saw someone who looked just like you... That's Lucifer. He's my twin brother, but we think quite the opposite. He's highly competitive and overconfident. Oh, I see. He knows a lot about dark matter and pulls out its destructive energy to use in battles. Master Amor always tells him to have a good heart, in order to control this power. Actually... It feels like I'm your brother too. Feels like I've known you. What are you saying? We're nothing like each other. Yaizael, what's your life's motto? Defeat all evil and establish justice. How about you, Michael? Use the sword of justice to destroy evil once and for all. We are alike. Right? Amor. Thank you for coming. Teach Earthlings love and the spirit of self-sacrifice. For my Lord, I am more than happy to sacrifice myself for Earth. Lord Elohim. Dahar's idea, "The strong shall rule over the weak" agitated some of the fighters. Most of them are aggressive kinds who have their roots in space. With the way they are, it's risky to fight again. How could I lead them as a team? What are your thoughts on them? I want to tell them this. If you want to live on Earth, you can. But then, you must follow Earth's rules! That's the least courtesy for Lord Elohim. Lord loves us no matter what race we are. Conflicts solve nothing. We want to mediate conflicts and build a peaceful future. I understand how you feel, but... We haven't held it for a while on Earth. But when Earth faces danger, various races exchange their opinions. It's called the Earth Conference. "The Earth Conference?" Very soon, the enemy will attack again. Now is the time we share our opinions and discuss what justice is on Earth. I'm sure we'll hear Lord Elohim's thoughts too. The Earth Conference... The Earth Conference... The Earth Conference... Order! The reason we urgently called the Earth Conference is to discuss ways to save Earth at this dangerous time. So let's figure out how we can do so! Especially to fight against Dahar and Centaurus Beta, we should discuss what justice is on Earth. And we'll make sure everyone's on the same page. So let's hear everyone's opinion on this. First, faith-minded Reptilians who almost bought into Dahar, why were you tempted by his words? Our race controls the evolution of the universe. What's wrong with an advanced race ruling the developing planets? In that perspective, we understand how Dahar and Centaurus Beta people feel. But the strong must protect the weak. That's what Lord Elohim teaches us! Yaizael, calm yourself. Next, the representative of Centaurus Alpha. Aren't there some people originally of your race those in Centaurus Beta who are trying to invade Earth? That's right! Can you really be on the Earthlings' side? We came here out of respect for Lord Elohim. We're also a kind of ape, but we're a loyal race with a devout faith in God. There are gentle people in Centaurus Beta. The ones trying to invade are technically advanced, but they don't have any sense of love or harmony. We can't let that cruel race destroy Earth! Good. Let's applaud Centaurus Alpha's commitment. Now, the representative of Earth, Commander Ladimir. What's your opinion? I'm now taking a human form as an Earthling. But more than 100 million years ago when the God of the Earth was born as Alpha, I was a Reptilian who'd just came to Earth. Back then, Earth was inhabited by dinosaurs and Earthlings were vulnerable and facing danger. Those of us from Zeta were looking for a new place to reside. Then Lord Alpha invited us to Earth. He wanted us to contribute to Earth using our principle of evolution and assigned us to protect the humans on Earth. At first, we had no sense of guilt catching and eating Earthlings. "The strong shall rule over the weak." Does that really mean the strong can do anything they want? Gradually, I started thinking about Earth's way of justice. Then Lord Alpha taught me this. By cultivating mental strength along with physical power, you'll grow further. And then you'll truly be the strongest fighter. The strong ha ve a responsibility to bring happiness to those around them using their strengths. Awaken to your mission as an Earthling. I finally understood how to use my power and what I should use it for. I became a devout believer of the God of the Earth. When I was reincarnated, I was allowed to be born with a human body and become a soul to protect Earth. Now that the God of the Earth has been reborn as Elohim, I am really honored to stand here as a representative of Earth! When I see how Lord Elohim shows what justice is, embracing diverse opinions and cultures, I truly feel His love. So I would like to protect this planet no matter what. Yaizael, what's your opinion? I--- I have been protecting various stars and planets for a long time. Many of my missions were to protect benign races from aggressors like Reptilians. Many from Vega or Pleiades are not cut out for battle at all. Without our protection, some of them would've been destroyed. But in those planets and stars, there surely is spirituality worthy of saving. Which might have been faith in God. And the thoughts of love and harmony to build a better world in the universe. It goes for Earth too! Even though some Reptilians have moved to Earth, the Earthlings as a whole are still vulnerable. So...I came here to protect the Earthlings. But I've learned a lot from them. Earth is worth saving. What makes Earth worthy of saving? I've never seen a planet where so many races are living and training their souls together. And now, so many people are coming together to unite and protect Earth. It's a miracle that Earth's God has welcomed many races and accepted them for who they are. My mother star was destroyed, and I had nowhere to go. The God of the Earth invited us to utilize our spirit of beauty on Earth. Us too! Lord Elohim told us to share the spirit of harmony on Earth. That's why we came to Earth. Some of us Reptilians were also invited by the God of the Earth. God must take delight in the strong. Justice lies within strength. That's partially true. I also defeat evil with my force. And I believe that's in God's Will. We, the Andromedans feel the same. Well, we Reptilians cherish our strength too. But why can't some of us return to heaven after death? All living beings are equal in the sense that we are all precious creations of God. At the same time, even though God grants us freedom, He doesn't allow specific races to overpower the rest. What? Friendly competitions are necessary for our spiritual growth, but you'll lack something important just doing that. It's love. You mean we don't have love? How dare you! I do love my wife! Calm down. I'm not talking about sexual love. You lack the kind of love you have for your neighbor. It's obvious. That's why the Lord summoned us from Sagittarius to show Earthlings the spirit of love and self-sacrifice. It's a concept opposite from the Reptilians whose forte is competition. Those who led an overly selfish life, and the ones who terrorized others are considered evil in Lord's Will. But He still believes that the light dwells inside them. He doesn't wipe out their existence but gives them a chance to reflect on themselves. That proves how much Lord loves them. I got it. Everyone here...I mean, anyone involved with Earth has been deeply loved by the God of the Earth. That must be one thing we all share, isn't it? That's true. That's...right. God created all existence. In that sense, Earthlings and space people... ...are all equal and precious. You all have different ideas and opinions. You may express your ideas and share what you think is right. Surely, there will be differences of opinion. For things you humans can't judge, pray to heaven and listen to the voice of God. And make decisions based on God's Laws. First, have faith. Then every race should recognize the good in each other, compensate shortcomings, and make progress together. This is the principle we value on Earth. Lord Elohim, thank you very much for such precious words. We put our faith in the God of the Earth first. We thank Him for letting us live, and we will make His ideal world reality. For Earth that Lord Elohim Loves. Yeah! For Earth! For Earth! For Earth! For Earth! For Earth! For Earth! Here. I've finally finished. I'm proud of how well they are made. Each weapon has been embedded with a fragment of the Vega's crystal. They may not be as tough as Yaizael's weapon, but enough to counterattack any enemy from outer space. Yaizael only gave you a limited amount of crystals. How did you make so many weapons? Well, actually... It never runs out. What? The crystal reproduces itself no matter how much I shave it. It never runs out. Alright, everyone! To control these weapons, you must possess love of justice and the spirit of self-sacrifice. To fight with the spirit of self-sacrifice? What do you mean? Don't fight to save yourself but fight to protect your loved ones. Oh no. That's a spirit I don't have. That's exactly why you need to learn it on this planet Earth. Once you do, you'll become truly powerful fighters! Yes, Ma'am! First, let's train your minds to focus. Everyone, picture something that is most important to you. Something that is most important to me. That's Earth who raised me. Whoa! Calm your minds and come to the mirror. What do you see? Well... We see ourselves... Not quite. Everyone, put your minds together, and try to find your true self. We'll become one with Lord Elohim and fight together! Now we're a team. Ah Elohim! I see it now Your true love is Panguru The Chanel of ancient times Ah Elohim! I see it now Your true love is Panguru The Chanel of ancient times Lady Panguru, we have a situation! It's an emergency! What is it this time? The Centaurus Beta Army's fleet is approaching Earth. They've come sooner than we thought. How many ships are there? Um...they're so many more than the last time. Probably several thousand ships. Several thousand? Excuse me! The Dahar's Army's black hole has appeared. Dahar's here too? This battle will be a deadly one which we must be ready to die in. Everyone, are you ready? Of course! It's my soul's deepest honor to fight with Lord Elohim. I'll be one with the Elohim Army as I'll give my all fighting for the Lord. We'll now go into battle. For Earth that God loves! For Earth! For Earth! I see the enemy ships! Prepare to open fire! Fire! Ready! Fire! Watch for the Andromedans! They'll target the commandership first. Yeah! For Earth we love! For Earth! You! You're apes like us, but chose the Earthlings' side? We'll protect Earth as the fighters of the Elohim Army! Sir! The Andromedan army attacked us! Our commandership at the front line has been blown to pieces! Dammit! The Andromedan army... How dare they get in our way! Sir! Our land forces have their backs against the wall from the Elohim Army's unexpected advance! Elohim? The God of the weak Earthlings? That damn Elohim! It's time we bring the game to an end! Let's get it ready to shoot. Don't hold back! Move forward! Master Amor is so powerful! He's always very gentle, but he won't tolerate the dark side. God is the Creator of all and everything. Remember, our faith in God brings about miracles. Repent your sins. You're trying to conquer the world with fear. The God of Love will never approve of that. The Galactic Federation team, we'll intercept their mother ship! Roger! I'm fighting with Lord Elohim now. This is the peak of my existence! Evil for evil! Is that acceptable? Lucifer. I like your eyes. You have a very strong power. You must get it. You know how the strong want to dominate the weak. Aren't you interested in becoming the king of Earth? Well...I could be more powerful than anyone on Earth. Don't listen to him! Shut your mouth! We're discussing something important here. Yaizael! Th...thank you. My sword is the sword of justice that will destroy evil! I knew you and I are alike. Michael...you're not wanted. For you guys, muscle heads, I've brought you a special friend! Bombing completed! Yeah! What's that huge ship? All I know is that we must stop it now whatever that is. Right. From E2 to E5, keep your formation and attack! Roger! Are you okay? Minotaur. A devil in the flesh like you doesn't scare me at all! Michael! She did it! Watch out! Ladimir! Ladimir! Look at me! Yaizael... As a fighter for justice, if ought alongside you. What an honor it was... Please take care... of Earth. Open your eyes, Ladimir! Yaizael! Look out! Looking good! Now I'll break the barrier around the palace. Everyone. Let us pray. Lord Elohim, please save our planet. I won't let you come even one step near Elohim, the God of Light! You know, eighty percent of space is made of dark matter. The essence of the universe is darkness. That makes you guys filth in this darkness. Therefore your existence goes against the laws of the universe! You're wrong. It's God's Will to spread light into the universe. Darkness only exists before the light shines. Dahar, you're just being vengeful because your universe perished. You're such an eyesore, Panguru! Ah Ah Ah... Ah Ah Ah... Ah Ah Ah... The time has come If we don't fight There is no reason we are here We must fight We must fight I'll never tolerate darkness! We must fight To protect Lord Elohim God of the Earth Panguru, fight! Being a woman is no excuse Fight, Panguru! Fight, Panguru! Hiding tears behind your fists Make a charge, Panguru! With your heart full of sorrow I shed tears for peace Filled with love and courage I really Want to protect you With all my life I really do It's coming from the bottom Of my heart Oh no! You put up a good fight. But playtime is over. What? Because Earth is about to perish! I guess It's...over. Yaizael. Where am I? Am I...dead? Yaizael. Lord Elohim! While you're on Earth, what have you learned? /.-- /.-- I saw many different races recognizing each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses. I've learned that we can make progress together. And... We don't live just for ourselves. We live for the love of others. The righteous must be strong. The strong must deepen love. I learned that the God of the Earth loves us unconditionally and how precious it is to live in pure faith. For Earth that God loves! For Earth! For Earth! I have learned... that justice is to realize God's ideal world. So I'll work under Lord Elohim and protect Earth no matter what! Yaizael. From now on, you will be a weapon that embodies my justice. Yaizael! Wh...what's going on? Elohim Please hear our prayers Elohim Please protect and keep us safe forever Elohim I beg you to defeat devils completely The righteous must be strong. Fight for the Truth! Dammit! That ship doesn't even rattle! Sir! Dahar's army has finally broken down the barrier around Elohim's palace. So slow! Damn Dahar... it took him long enough to conquer the palace. He was the one who told us the barrier neutralizes nuclear attacks, wasn't he? And now the enemy is regaining their power. Alright, we'll launch a nuclear attack, then, we'll all go ashore. Sir! We're ready for a nuclear strike! But our allies are still there. They're merely pawns. So do not worry. Discard them. What? But... Hurry up! Move! Yes, Sir! Get the nuclear missiles ready! We'll start the countdown. Three, two, One! Is that...? No! Evol! Earth exists to offer various races a chance for spiritual training. It's a planet of love. You're trying to destroy Earth, but I will never allow that to happen! Get the nuclear missiles ready! We'll start the countdown. Three... Two... one! W...wait! Damn Evol... Don't chicken out now! Dammit! Everyone is so useless! Dahar... You're just a bystander in history. But you almost succeeded in tricking us into having bad karma by destroying a planet. All troops, we're pulling out! All troops, pull out! The God of the Earth! Why do you always get in my way? Dahar, darkness never conquers light. Brace yourself, Dahar! The truly strong exist to love and protect the world! Shut up! You'll regret this! Get back here! You won't get away with this! As long as Lord Elohim is with us Earth is forever protected. They're gone. I wonder how far she'll chase Dahar. I don't know. But I'm sure she'll keep fighting for justice based on what she's learned on Earth. Thank you, Yaizael. Now that you're gone, I will devote my life to protecting Earth based on justice taught by Lord Elohim. Master Amor, we averted the threat against Earth. Well, I gotta say, my work was magnificent. No one can top that. Lucifer. Don't be arrogant. We won the battle not just because of your work. We won because everyone came together to fight. If you don't reflect on yourself... It was a sad story My twin little brother Became jealous of God And wanted to become God My name is Michael The greatest among Seven Archangels My twin little brother is Son of the Dawn, Lucifer He used to be a beautiful young man But he was blinded by The status and glory of God And misunderstood God's true will Hoping that he would be God He started REVOLUTION I defeated him with my sword Shot him down from heaven Of the great universe Struck him to the ground like thunder Then he fell into hell Now is the time for me to clarify what Earth's way of justice is. What is good, and what is evil in this world? You might not always know. The laws or principles that humans make in this world are not always right. First, have faith in God. Listen to God's words. Do not disregard the wisdom humans have long cultivated. Materialistic prosperity and science are allowed but this world is not the final dwelling place for humans. It's a ground for spiritual training. Keep that in mind, and cultivate wisdom to choose what's right among diverse values. To establish justice on Earth, I will keep fighting. With faith in God, live in the right way as human beings. Elohim, Elohim, Elohim
