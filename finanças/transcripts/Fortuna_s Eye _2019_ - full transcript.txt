We are currently in an emergency landing. Pull the mask and cover your nose and mouth. Please put on the oxygen mask! Please put on the oxygen mask! Fortuna is the Goddess of Fortune. Help me. It's said that people who have her eye see persons who are destined to die becoming transparent. [ Fortuna no Hitomi ] [ Fortuna's Eye ] Kiyama. Kiyama! Boss? The only thing that was to be done with this car is coating of the hood. I found a scratch. Did you also work overtime yesterday for that? I'm sorry for doing unnecessary things. It'll be finished on time. That's a rule, isn't it? Kiyama, do you have a moment? Is that the branch store? Yeah. So it's going to open soon? Yeah, it'll open soon and you will be assigned its manager. I want you to be the manager of the branch store. I can't do something like that. How many years are you here now? 10 years, isn't it? 10 years, huh? Time flies so fast. When you came here for the first time, you didn't even know how to do masking. But there must be someone better than me. Well, think about it. Hello, it's me. Ah, I'm reorganizing the schedule now. He will have considered all your colleagues too! He thinks the one to do it is you, Shin-chan. Kaneda-san. What? Do you have proof that I did it? It must be great, huh? Being the favourite of the boss and all that. Why? I'm talking about Shin-chan. You said you would make him the manager of the branch store. I guess he's very skilled. Well, if you're talking about skills, I think Kaneda-kun is good enough. Indeed, Kaneda's good too. But, whenever I look at Kiyama, I worry. I have a feeling that the reason why he works so much is just to avoid having free time for himself. It's difficult to choose, isn't it? What are you looking for today? Today, I didn't come here to buy something new. My cell phone got broken. Oh, you're here for repairs, right? Please come over there. Ah, sorry. Let me see. It's still a traditional cell phone. I'm very sorry. This is an outmoded model, so it would be difficult for the manufacturer to repair it. You're right... even though this model is good. Please wait a moment. Ah, um... Why do you stick to this phone? I don't know much about the current models. Besides, I've always been not very good at choosing anything. I know. Life is a series of choices after all, isn't it? But you did make a choice, didn't you? You said you wanted this one. I think that's also a splendid choice. Okay. Done. This is a temporary repair for the time being. Thank you very much. And the repair cost? Ah, it's alright. But... Just, keep it secret, okay? This train is bound for Ashiyama. After Kataoka it will stop at Hinokura. Sorry. I know it's strange how I hold the chopsticks. No, not at all. Shin-chan. The job as manager of the branch store, shouldn't you accept it? You see, the boss is like that, but he thinks like a father of you. I know. - Ah, sorry. - Ah, excuse me. Here we go. One, two, three. He's dead, isn't he? Hey. Hey! It's cold. Don't stand there staring blankly. Sorry. Hey, have you heard? There was an accident last night near the station. Ah, yes. The one who died was the son of the president of the Chamber of Commerce. Somehow I was shocked. You really don't know people's fate, do you? Mitsuko-san. What if you knew, what would you do? Knew what? People's fate. What do you mean? Something like precognition? For example, you would know that someone is about to die. What? No. I wouldn't want to know when people will die. What? Should I go and tell people that they are about to die? It would look like I was the grim reaper. That's true. Of course! Huh? This might be more difficult to repair than last time. I guess so. I'm very sorry. It was precious to you after all. Ah, no. It's alright. I think it's a good opportunity to buy a new one. You're not good at choosing, right? Yes. Shall I help you choose? Thank you very much. Shall I keep that? Perhaps we can retrieve the data in it. Excuse me. Take it please. Is something wrong? I just thought your nails looked pretty. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, forget it! But... Are you alright? Let me return this. Kiryu Aoi-san. Yes? I have something important to tell you. After you're done with work, would you give me 30 minutes of your time? Could you wait for me in the cafe in front of the station? I think I can be there at around 8:30 PM. Sorry to make you wait. Huh? It's back to normal. Thank goodness. Excuse me... I'm sorry. What do you want to tell me? You said you had something important to tell me. Well, actually, there was something I was worried about. But, the issue is over now. Over? Yes, in an instant. What were you worried about? - I don't think you'd believe me if I told you. - Please try telling me. You can't know if I believe you or not if you don't tell me. I... can see people's fate. Fate? Right now, I saved a person's life. I don't know how, but I actually saved her. The person you saved, could it be it was me? Please forget what happened tonight. I'm very sorry to waste your time with such a weird story. Shin-chan, good morning. Um, Boss... - Good morning. - Put it left. Okay, got it. Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. To the right side. - Shin-chan! - Yes? I'll return to the main branch so I'll leave things to you here. Thanks for your hard work. Hey. Did something good happen? No, not really. You shouldn't work too hard before the opening. Ah, sorry. Ah, no. You seemed so immersed in your work so I just watched. Is this car washing? No, this is called polishing. By this we also remove small scratches on the car. I see. Even like this it's pretty. Not at all. Ah, you see... I'm sorry for coming here so suddenly. Kiyama Shinichiro-san. How can you know my name? I'm sorry. I looked at the customer card and went to your workplace. I guess it's a violation of the data protection act, right? I'm sorry, this is all we have. No, no. Thank you very much. Delicious. Excuse me... I came here today to express my gratitude. Gratitude? For what? For saving my life. This is the newspaper of the day after we met at the cafe. This factory is a building I always pass by. And the time when it exploded was right the time when I usually pass by there. If I had taken my usual train from the station, I would have gotten into that hell. If you had not asked me to talk with you, I would have been in that accident. It's just a coincidence. Is there a coincidence like that? Kiyama-san. You said you could see fate, didn't you? Did I say that? And you said you saved my life. I don't remember. Sorry. It was just bashfulness. Please forget about it. Kiyama-san. You saved me. Thank you very much. Please stop it. I've been thinking hard since that night. I've been wondering what kind of person my lifesaver is. I guess it's been a disappointment, seeing me like this. No. I'm glad. That you are like this. Huh? Did a customer come yesterday evening? I'm sorry that I used the teabags without asking. No. That's quite alright. There were neither milk nor sugar and I thought I shouldn't serve just black coffee. Did she say she didn't drink coffee? No, that's not it. Not exactly. Just as I thought, it was a girl. Yes. Now I see. That's why you want to be a manager, right? This has nothing to do with it! It was just a joke, a joke. Look, Shin-chan, I talked like this because I thought it was Mariko-chan. But now I see. You finally found someone like that. Mitsuko-san. Do you think people's fate is already decided? Are you talking about that again? I've always thought that people's fate was already decided long ago and it couldn't be changed. I think that's why I'm like this. I don't believe in something like fate. Did you know? In the time between waking up in the morning and the night you make about 9000 different decisions. Every day you make all these troublesome decisions, but it's not yourself who decides on our life, it's all fate. You don't want to hear that, do you? Say, Shin-chan, did you know? I heard the new Italian Restaurant near the station is pretty good! Will you go and try? Shin-chan doesn't understand, does he? It's alright, Mitsuko-san. What? It's alright. Done with work? Going home? Mariko has let herself in with a weirdo again, huh? Yeah. I heard that guy Utsui was involved in dirty deals behind the scenes. Utsui-san invited me for a drive next time. What do you think about it, Shin-chan? Why don't you go if you want to? You should decide, Shin-chan. I... I've told you I don't know! Are you playing dumb? What's going on? Do you have any proof? It seems someone used a customer's car without permission. I got a call from the owner. On Sunday, he saw his car near the station being driven by a woman. It's this car you're currently polishing. Couldn't he be mistaken? No, he's not. There are additional 100 km on the odometer since this car was handed in. You're fired as of today. You've gotta be kidding! I'm gonna sue you for unfair dismissal! Go and try it! What are you looking at! Is that how you handle our work tools? I'll send you all your belongings. Get lost now straightaway! Everyone get back to work. Boss, when will you leave? Is there anything you want? If you like, how about we go out for a meal? Boss? Okay, let's go. It's been awhile. What do you want to eat? We haven't celebrated the opening of the branch store yet. That's not why I asked you out. What's wrong? No, it's nothing. Well, since it's been a while, how about sushi? Kaneda?! Kiyama?! You bastard! What was your intention? Huh?! You were after me, huh? I'm sorry. That's not an apology! It's back. Boss, forgive him... Kiyama?! Kiyama! Are you alright, Kiyama? Kiyama! Kiyama! Help me... Help me... Help me! Are you awake? Thank goodness! Are you alright? Does it hurt where you got hit? No... I was hit? The doctor is currently talking to the boss. Shall I call him? I'm alright. Excuse me, what about Kaneda-san? For today, we let him go home. Well, I think he really regrets what he did. I see. You also should take a rest for a day. Okay. I can't find the cause on this chest X-ray. Do you have any chronic diseases? No. Did you have any symptoms of a heart attack before? Yes, once. Extreme stress might be the cause. Let's proceed with a thorough examination. Alright. Let it be. Don't do unnecessary things. But... You saw her becoming transparent, right? That girl. Just as I thought. Since when can you see it? Recently, I've started to see it clearly. But, I think I've been able to see it since a long time. I see. Are you also able to see them becoming transparent? Yeah. When I do a medical examination, I can see whether the patient will survive. If I see them becoming transparent, I know they will die soon. Could it be that you changed someone's fate? Let me give you one piece of advice. Don't change people's fate. Why? Because it's up to God. This eye we have is Fortuna's Eye. Fortuna? Fortuna is the Goddess of Fortune in the Roman mythology. People like us can see a person's future. However, if we interfere with other people's fate as we please, we inevitably have to pay the price. Pay the price? We are neither gods nor prophets. We must not interfere with other people's fate. Can you take the full responsibility for the life of the person whose fate you have changed? If you can't, then let it be. You saved me. Thank you very much. I guess it's been a disappointment, seeing me like this. No. I'm glad. That you are like this. Welcome. How can we help you today? Excuse me. I've come to see you. I think we can talk after 8:30 PM. [ In the cafe where we met last time ] You left early, didn't you? I went in a hurry. Hot. I always thought you would come again. So I wasn't surprised when you just came. Kiryu-san. Please go out with me. Let's go. Excuse me... I'm sorry for making you embarrassed. That startled me. I didn't leave the cafe because I was embarrassed. I just don't want other people to hear my answer. My answer to your question is "yes". Please take good care of me. Hey, look. Shin-chan! Congratulations. Thank you. - Feels good, huh? - Yeah. Boss. I have finished. What's next? Stop it please. Just call me Kiyama. You really work fast, don't you? It's just that you use too much time for excessive diligence. But, it's really a big help that you came here. Honestly, I couldn't do all this alone. Thank you. Why? Why did you put in a word for me with the boss? It was 1 out of 9000 decisions, but I think it's a good one. What's that supposed to mean? Okay, here you go. Bon appetit! How is it? Delicious. Much better than last time. You see! Today, I tried putting in avocados and anchovies. Delicious. Drinking beer during daytime somehow makes me happy. You were really busy all week, weren't you? When I'm on early shift, I have to catch the 7:30 AM train to Ashiyama to be on time. That's tough if you're not a morning person. How cute. I wasn't able to make them smile like that. What's wrong? When I was little, I wasn't good at talking. I only made people worry. I... was 6 years old when my parents died in a plane crash. The Yamanashi plane crash 20 years ago. I remember that. Many, many people died. But, why did I survive? Why am I the only one who survived? I've always wondered about that. So that you will become happy. You survived in order to become happy, Shin-chan. That's why in the future you should get married, have kids, go out on Sundays like now without worrying about anything. And you should call each other, "Papa" and "Mama". But it's alright if I call you Shin-chan, isn't it? I would like to have a baby girl who resembles you. What? Only a girl? Let us live the future. Here. Thanks. Good night. Good night. Thank you for waiting. Please check it. Thank you for your patronage. Okay, we'll take some radiographs. Heart attack? The coronary artery is constricted. I've told you. You pay the price. Pay the price... Whenever you save someone, your own body comes close to death. Therefore these heart attacks. Your heart and the blood vessels in your brain have suffered invisible damage. You better be careful. Even if you're close to death, you can't see yourself becoming transparent. Since your last seizure, have you changed the fate of someone who was being transparent? No. But, don't worry. I won't change other people's fate anymore. So I have decided. I'll prescribe you nitroglycerin. When you feel the same pain again, take it at once. Huh? Is it really here? Your boss asked me to go here so I came. Such a small place isn't easy to find. Welcome, Utsui-san. Well then, I'm counting on you. Please come in. Excuse me. Is Uematsu-san well? Who? Uematsu Mariko. Formerly she was the receptionist in our main store. Then, how should I know her? Mariko, isn't that Karen? Ah, Mariko! So that was her name. She said she had lost her source of income, so I introduced her to a friend's brothel. You quickly get tired of a girl who does it so easily, right? Huh? Could it be you were in love with her? Whoa, sorry! Well, between people who drive Ferraris and people who polish Ferraris, there's a big difference. Ah, but I think you can see her in the shop named "Platinum" near the station. Maybe she'll give you a treat thanks to your old friendship. - Right? - Yeah. However, she sucks, right? Please stop teasing our boss. Let me go. I'm a customer here. People who polish Ferraris have their pride too. Shall I call #110? Kaneda-san! Kiyama... He's a customer. So it was. If I had then properly shown her my feelings, her future would be different. Mariko had not chosen an unhappy life. That's right. It's your fault, Shin-chan, isn't it? Right? Blaming yourself so much for things of the past is not good. You know, life can't be restarted. But... The one who chose such a life was Mariko-chan herself, right? Besides, the only one who can know if her choice was correct or not, is she herself. Still, that Utsui is a nasty fellow, isn't he? I hope he gets some kind of divine punishment. Oh, it's already waiting. Can you give me the keys? I'm gonna go for a drive with a girl. Then, please go to the office... I've paid in advance, right? I don't need a receipt. Give it to me. What are you doing? Hurry up and give it to me. Here you go. Seems he fell asleep at the wheel. Mama, where's Papa? Where's Papa? Shin-chan! Shin-chan? I'm the same. I've played with other people's fate. You only polished his car, right? - You didn't do anything. - It's exactly because I didn't do anything! Even though I could have saved him. It was the same during that plane crash. I wasn't able to save her. Didn't you save my life? That explosion was just a coincidence. But if you had not approached me on that day, I wouldn't be here now. It was all decided by fate. A nitwit can't understand that! You are weak, aren't you? I'll be leaving for today. I didn't want this power. Help me... Thank you. Here. No way. Why? Hey! What are you doing?! Please stop it. Let's go quickly. Let's go, let's go. I'm sorry. [ Announcement for Families with Children ] [ Lot's of fun at the Ashiyama Public Garden ] 7:30. Bound for Ashiyama. When I'm on early shift, I have to catch the 7:30 AM train to Ashiyama to be on time. That's tough if you're not a morning person. [ June 24, Friday ] The day after tomorrow! Shin-chan! Aoi. I'm sorry. I... should have considered your feelings. I'm sorry. What I said to you last time applies all to myself. I'm the one who's weak. I notice everything around me, but I don't do anything. We're hungry, right? Shall I prepare something? What should I make? There are eggs and tomatoes. I could make omelette rice. No! Shin-chan? No matter what the future will bring, I'll definitely protect you. What's wrong? It's nothing. Aoi. What is it? Shouldn't we take a vacation? What? Where should we go? Okinawa. Okinawa? Sure, sounds great. When shall we go? Tomorrow, for 3 days. Tomorrow?! That's sudden, isn't it? A regular customer booked a tour there. But suddenly something came up and he asked if I would go in their place. What do you think? Let's go! Really? Tomorrow, you're on early shift, right? Will it be alright with your shift? Don't worry. I'll do something about it. I've decided to come with you after all. I guess I should start preparing for our trip. Yes, this is Nishimori Nursery School. I'm one of the parents who have a child at your school. Tomorrow is the trip, right? Ah, yes. Tomorrow is the Parent-Child trip. Can that be rescheduled to another day? It's a bit short-dated, isn't it? I'm sorry but... Ah, no, that's not it. I just think it should better be postponed. I see... I'm sorry to ask but who am I talking to? I said you must not go! Tomorrow something bad will happen... Are you perhaps the one who was at the park last time? What do you want today? I have nothing more to tell you. What are you doing? Is this a test? Whether you are being transparent or not? I'm sorry. Um, since the plane crash, I've always been thinking about it. I've always wondered why I survived. But if I can save someone with this power... Don't get ahead of yourself! Even if you risk your own life to save the life of someone else, no one will notice and you won't get praised. Besides, the next time you change someone's fate in order to save them, you'll die with certainty. You would just die in vain. That's why I won't interfere. And I have no intention to tell you if you are being transparent or not. Go home. Even so! If I protected someone who's precious to me, would that really be in vain? Huh? How was the check-up? I'm alright again. Kaneda-san. This is the car delivery list for tomorrow. Can I ask you to deliver them all? What? Are you taking a day off? I'm going on a trip. With a girl? Well, yes. It can't be helped, huh? Leave it to your excellent subordinate then. Thank you very much. Why are you bowing to me? It's giving me the creeps. I've heard it! You're going on a trip with your girlfriend, right? She's such a nice girl. I'm happy for you, Shin-chan. Thanks for this. Ah, looks delicious! Okay! To celebrate this, I'll take Tailor's Earl Grey and serve a royal milk tea. What's wrong? Boss. I'm sorry that the sales of the branch store haven't risen yet. I haven't repaid the kindness you've given me at all. What are you saying? You've repaid me enough with your hard work. Besides, I like guys like you. Ah, right. I thought of using a new coating agent. The samples already came so can you test it in your shop? There he goes with this new coating agent again. Dear Aoi, I'm sorry that I lied to you about the Okinawa trip. Please forgive me for choosing this fate. Okay, please line up in front of your teachers. [ I'll pick you up at 8 AM tomorrow so wait at home. ] [ Shin-chan, I'm sorry. ] [ I can't go after all. ] [ Seems the girl who should take my shift is sick... ] You're Kiyama Shinichiro-san, aren't you? You called Nishimori Nursery School yesterday, right? You also molested a child in the park some days before, right? I'm sorry, but could you tell us about it in detail at the station? Alright. Ah! Hey! Wait! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop right now! Outch! Until now, I've always avoided to choose. I was living in a black and white world so why do I have this mysterious power? I've always wondered about that. But, without this power, I had not been able to approach Aoi. When I met Aoi it was the first time that I wanted to choose life. Um, excuse me! Where is the 7:30 AM train to Ashiyama? Huh? Ah, it's arriving just now. - Please stop it! - Huh? What're you talking about? Ah, wait. Wait! The train to Ashiyama is now departing. Aoi?! Why? Shin-chan?! It's that person. That's him. Hey! To Hinokura Station, two stations ahead please. Hurry up! Ah, okay. Hey! We are connecting you to the answering machine... Dammit! Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Um, Sir! Keep the change. Wait. Sorry. Excuse me! Excuse me! They're transparent... I see. Kiyama! Aoi. Until now, I've lived in a black and white world, and the one who brought bright colours into my life is you. Since I met you, I understand the meaning of this power, and the meaning of life. Hey! What are you doing?! That's why I would surely, no matter how many times my fate repeated, each time make the same choice again. Stop it! Shin-chan! Shin-chan... Arrest the suspect! Get away from that man! Shin-chan. At first, he always had that expression, hadn't he? But after he met you, he really started to smile a lot. All the time until then. He looked as if he had resigned to something, didn't he? The one who was made happy is me. Fortuna is the Goddess of Fortune. I have the same eyes as you. Perhaps we can retrieve the data in it. That day, my hands appeared transparent when you looked at them. Is something wrong? That's why you approached me in order to save me. Kiryu Aoi-san. I have something important to tell you. Right now, I saved a person's life. I don't know how, but... "There's no doubt." "He's my man of fate", I thought. That's why I searched and searched for you, and finally found you. You seemed so immersed in your work so I just watched. It's not because we had the same power. I fell in love with the man you are. Please go out with me. Excuse me... I'm sorry for making you embarrassed. And then, I knew that you really were my man of fate. My parents died in a plane crash. The Yamanashi plane crash 20 years ago. I remember that. Because the girl you tried to save at that time was me. It was the same during that plane crash. I wasn't able to save her. No. Didn't you save my life? You saved me. Are you okay? At that time, you changed my fate. And I was fated to see you again. And then, you once again saved my life. This time, even at the expense of your own life. What's wrong? It's nothing. Why do we have this power? If you save someone's life, you're not allowed to live together with this person. It's a sad fate. That's why I accepted this fate. Since I loved you, I wanted you to live. I made this choice even though I'm weak and there would be many casualties, because I wanted that you would survive. Shin-chan... Why? But there is one reason why I'm thankful for this power. Because, Shin-chan, I was able to meet you and was loved by you. Dear Aoi, I'm sorry that I lied to you about the Okinawa trip. I've always avoided to choose. Until now, I've lived in a black and white world, and the one who brought bright colours into my life is you. That's why I would surely, no matter how many times my fate repeated, each time make the same choice again. There is one reason why I'm thankful for this power. Because I was able to meet you and love you. There's nothing cooler I could say. The truth is I wanted to live together with you. I wanted to cling to the world full of colours with you. As you said, I'm a weak man. I'm not good with words so I can't formulate brilliantly my feelings for you. I haven't proposed to you yet, so please forgive me for being so cheeky. That's why in the future you should get married, have kids, go out on Sundays like now without worrying about anything. And you should call each other, "Papa" and "Mama". Lastly, I'll tell you something I haven't told you all the time. [ I love you. ] You really are too cheeky.
