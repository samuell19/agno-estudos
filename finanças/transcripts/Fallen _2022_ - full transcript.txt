Oh, Lord on High, grant me this prayer. Aid Your most humble servant and imbue this water with Your holy blessing such that it will cast away demons... and weaken the illnesses afflicting this, Your son. Keep the homes of Your faithful purified from the presence of evil and keep at bay all its filthy trickery. In nomine Patris, et Filli et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Thank you, Father. Ahem. Today's services have concluded. Please, come back tomorrow. Tomorrow may be too late, Father. Abraham, the time has come. Your Reverence... I was not expecting to see you again after so many years have passed. I wish the reason for my visit were more pleasant. Abraham, something truly terrible is on the horizon, an evil like this world has never seen before. You know what I'm referring to. The signs are everywhere. Our Lord teaches us that violence is never the answer. But the time has come that even the most holiest of saints must become executioners. Abraham, we need your help. The way is long and difficult. But out of hell, we are led to the light. We will provide you with the means to defeat the coming darkness. You will not be alone as you walk through the dark valley. Are you willing to join us in this fight? Yes. Do you have the strength to make the sacrifices? Yes. Do you accept this mission of violent mercy? Yes, I accept. Oh, Eternal one, give this man the power to be your sword and administer your justice. It's been weeks since the darkness has overtaken the entire continent and there are no signs of its ending in sight. Riots in the streets continue in every city. The government encourages its citizens to stay calm, even though the death rate continues to climb. The president has announced that over the... To battle this evil, you must leave the city. Escape those places where the darkness will first descend. Our faithful will need a guide and you must be their shepherd. It is your duty to prepare them for what is to occur. May God be with you. May God be with you. Let's go. Well, well, well, it's about time. Good day to you, sir. Sorry, I'm a bit late. Come on in. I'd offer you a little something to drink, but this piss isn't fit for guests. Brought you everything from your list, Mr. Fallen, everything except milk. They were out at the general store today, but I'll try again tomorrow. That's all right. As long as I got my poison, I'm happy. Well, I could use a hand putting all this away. You bet, sir. Sir... how are things today? Well, not much different from other days. Thank you, Thomas. Don't mention it, sir. It's the least I can do to show our gratitude - for all you've done for our community. - This. Over there. Ah. Goes to the back of the house. Hasn't been opened since... the darkness. I got wood to chop. You keep an eye on her. Hey, Sarah. I got a little something. Well, that looks really fine on you, Sarah. Just imagine if that thing could talk. All the stories it would tell. Maybe it belonged to a Russian Czar's wife, or a fancy French queen. Now it's all yours. Let me go fix something hot for you. How is Sarah doing? Gave her something to sleep. Now she's out like a light. Well, if there's nothing more I can do for you, sir, I'll be going. Son... you're not going anywhere. Mmm. This is a fine supper, sir. I haven't eaten that well since before the darkness. What's that? Well, I went out on a limb this morning when I was at the general store, got it for her. You shouldn't have. No, sir. It's no problem at all. If you don't mind me saying so, sir, It's very uncanny how much Sarah's looking more and more like the missus. What do you mean? Well, I was having a look at the photograph... over by the gramophone today. Sarah is spitting image of your wife. Actually... Sarah doesn't look a thing like her. - No, sir, I'm telling you... - But she doesn't! Sarah never would have abandoned me. The rain's let up. Time for you to leave. Thanks for supper, sir. Good night, Sarah. Mary, Mary. - No, no, no. - Mary. - Stop. No! - Let me through! I'm sorry, she shall live, but she'll be nothing but a cripple. Nothing but a cripple. Nothing but a cripple. - Nothing but a cripple. - Nothing but a cripple. Nothing but a cripple. ...but a cripple. Nothing but a cripple. Nothing but a cripple. Hey. Shh. Hey. Hey, come here! Come here! As of tomorrow, no more visitors. Just wanted to apologize for my behavior last night. I brought you that milk we were missing and... there's a token of my apologies. A bit of something extra. I hope you like it. You do know how to get back in my good graces, huh? Where's my usual welcoming comittee? Mm, my dog... Who knows where he's off to now. Probably run after a hare into the woods somewhere. I was just about to go looking for him. Want me to come along? Ah, that won't be necessary. You look after Sarah for me. My pleasure, sir. This one. This was the music for a picture show I saw in town when I was little. I can't remember the name of it, but it was the story of this powerful magic spell that made this big clay statue come to life. I wish you could tell me what's wrong. One day, I'm gonna take you far, far away from all this. You have my word. Sir, I just don't know what Sarah... - Out. - But sir... - I said out of this house, now. - Sir! Sir, I swear to God, I didn't do anything. Sir? What's wrong with you? Have you gone mad? Get out of here and don't you ever come back! Don't you dare look at me that way! I'm going out to check on the traps before dark falls. It won't be long. Sleep well. My heavenly Father, I do tremble at Your mercy, and beg You to fill me with Your strength. May my eternal faith in You guide me in this fight to drive out the evil spirits who doth torture this creature. You, Lord, who will rain down Your wrath of fire and fury on that day of judgment for all men. Amen. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! You'll be safe here. It'll all be okay. My Sarah... Are you all right? We're unsafe up here. Tonight we'll sleep downstairs again. Collect your things for tonight. Who's there?! It's me, Thomas. Told you to never show your face back here again. What's going on? Why are the doors and windows boarded up? Where's Sarah? It's none of your concern. Get out of here. I'm not going anywhere until you answer my questions and I know Sarah's okay! Just who do you think you're talking to, you little...? Sarah! Sarah! Get out of here. Sir... lower that rifle. Get out of my sight! Unless you want to end up just a memory in my prayers tonight. Ten, nine, eight... This won't be the last you'll see of me. If you think I'm just going to leave... Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Let's do it. It's been a long time... since the two of us have had a face-to-face. Now... all of this is Your will. I will humbly accept it as so. But help me to see what I've done to wrong You. Give me a sign. That's what I thought. Father, bless this water, You who ordered the prophet Elijah to purify water with salt. Let it be this day that we're freed from evil and protected by Your Holy Spirit. In Christ's Name, amen. - Hi, Daddy. - Hey. My little one, eh? My brothers and sisters, we find ourselves in the midst of trying times. Now more than ever, our community must band together because the darkness is coming. We must unite in strength and it will be the word of our Lord that will save us, you can be sure. So now let us read of the Apocalypse from the scriptures of St. John. In nomine Patris, et Filli et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Father, I just wanted to thank you again for rescuing my fathers' soul from the dark shadows. He never had another attack after your help. You saved his life. It was hardly my doing. That's the will of the Lord you saw, He who chose to be gracious and generous with your father that day. We are not always able to understand what our Heavenly Father has in store for us. - Thank you. - Thank you. Father. I'm so sorry. Um... You have to understand that you're the most precious thing I have. You're my little one. I hope one day on this... This will help you sleep. The vigil watch arouses a fear... which keeps awareness at bay... just as a mortal sin drives away sleep. Sarah. You know, I haven't made you your favorite lunch since before the darkness. You slept so deeply last night. You know, I think what happened was no accident. It was God's intent to test our faith like He did with Job and Abraham before him. He wanted to punish us for what we've done. Shame us for our sins... and put us on our path to repentance. And you repented? Abraham... What in the world is going on here? We need to talk. There are truths we need now speak. You have nothing to say for yourself? Then I will be the first to begin. Have I ever told you how it came to be that I dedicated my life to our Lord? It all began when I was a small boy, right about Sarah's age. My father would close me up in the cellar and would force me to memorize the whole Bible, every passage. One day I forgot a paragraph... and he beat me so hard, I was in bed the whole week after. Through all that, I never hated that man. Why should I? He told me the demons are always waiting. Abe, I don't follow you. And I lived with a demon for all these years. I slept with it, I fed it and I loved it with all my heart. - Abraham... - Silence! Silence. I saw what you were doing in our daughter's room. You've condemned her life! No, no, you misunderstood. I was only trying to cure Sarah's... I tell you! Don't even pronounce her name. Admit your sins. Admit your sins. Admit. There's nothing worse... than a witch! "Beware, the ritual will not work." Thomas. Sarah! Sarah! Rise, I command, rise from your sleep and come forth in multitudes. With these signs, I summon you here. With these words, I declare the gates open. Why have you done this to me? After all that I've done for you? Silence, Father. You are a witch, like your mother! "Beware, the ritual will not work if the curse is conjured by a blood relative." Recognize that, Daddy? Hmm? It's my mama's special book. It's the only memory I have left of hers. Her teachings... your death's perfect recipe... It's all in there. All I needed was a little bit of your blood... ...to complete the curse. Do you really think that faith of yours can get you out of this? You're wrong. That little potion you gave me last night gave you more of a chance than that stupid cross! After all... it gave you one more day of staying alive while I slept. If we can call what you do living. You've robbed me of my mama's love, then you take away the only friend I have in the world! It's my turn. It's my turn... to put an end to your miserable life! Let's even up the scales, shall we? I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, someone has finally woken up. I've been traveling alone for an hour now. Is everything okay? Yeah. I just had a bad dream. Mm. Do you want to talk about it? I can't remember much. It was me and you and our daughter... and some strange creatures attacking our home. Hmm. You should really cut out whatever you've been reading lately. Hey, are you all right? Yeah, it's just the baby. Lately she's been kicking, even more than normal - Well, it's almost time, you know? - Yeah. We should begin thinking of a name. Yeah. So... What do you think of Sarah? Sarah? Not bad. So, is it here? You'll see. We'll be happy here.
