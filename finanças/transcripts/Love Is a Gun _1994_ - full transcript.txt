Uh! Aah! Aah! Uh! Uh! Aah! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh, Isabel. Won't you save me? Won't you save me? Won't you save me? Take the shot, Jack. Won't you save me? Take the shot, Jack? Just one last time? Take the shot, Jack? Isabel, please. Okay. Okay, okay. Then I'll see you in hell, honey. All of you. No! This was a dream, right? It didn't feel like it, honey. No, Jack. You were dreaming, honey. You were still asleep. Come here. Jack, do you remember anything else? Yes. I killed somebody, or the police thought I had, and they were chasing me. And I was looking for you, but you wouldn't help, And I was begging you to come back. I was begging, but you wouldn't listen to me. Isabel, you hung up. You hung up. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Me, too. You know I love you. You know I'll always be there for you. I know. Do you remember why I was leaving you? Yeah. You thought I cheated on you. Oh. No wonder you shot yourself. You're lucky it was just a dream. Oh, really? Okay, you ready for my interpretation? Do I have a choice? What's today, Jack? Monday. The first day of your new job. What's the job about? Taking pictures. Photographing weird shit for the police, right? Right. It's obvious. You're afraid you're going to see something that changes you, that kills some aspect of yourself, and you're frightened when that part of you dies, I'll stop loving you. Isabel, why does the whole thing have to be about you? Because I'm incredibly important to you, Jack. I know it's hard for you to admit sometimes, but in a very real way, I am you, you are me. Heaven forbid. Our lives are totally entwined. On that note... Ahem... I think I'll go back to bed. Jack. Huh? When are you going to give me your grandma's engagement ring? Wait a minute. Is that what this is all about? Just let me try it on. I should never have told you about it. As far as I'm concerned, we're already married. You married me when you asked me to come out here. The ring is just a formality. [ALARM CLOCK BUZZING] Then what's the big hurry? Be patient for once in your life. Patient? You are a sadistic bastard, Jack. You've been teasing me with that ring for over a month now. "Do this, I'll let you see the ring. Do that, I'll let you try the ring on." I know exactly where you keep it hidden. Where? The pocket of your blazer. Relax. Never even looked at it. You never looked at it? I want it to be a special moment when you give it to me. [GARGLES] [SPITS] You know, you're sweet. You're wonderful. Yeah... You're stupid. [FLUSHES] Jack, open this door! I don't believe this! Open this door, Jack Hart! Okay, my timing is lousy, But yours is nonexistent. You have the communication skills of a fourth grader. Open the door! Let me out of this room! Jack, let me out now! Jack? Jack, please. Hey, wish me luck at my first day of work. Good luck, you bastard. I love you, Jack. Have a great first day. I love you, too, Isabel. Take a good look, gentlemen. [WHISTLES] Take a good look... Because as of today all such souvenirs are going into the trash... Where they belong. Boo. Boo. Boo. Now a reminder, gentlemen. The deadline for this year's departmental photo competition is August 17th. That's right. That gives you a little over three weeks to get your printing and your mounting done. For the benefit of Mr. Hart, the newest member of our little fraternity... Whoo! Whoo! I will reiterate. Each entry must consist of three images illustrating the phrase... A Woman's Place. A woman's place is on my face. That's nothing. not only does my face seat six, but I know how to breathe through my ears. Mr. Hart, you'll be spending this afternoon with Mr. Tynan in the field strictly as an observer, and then tomorrow morning. Mr. Liebovitz here will go over our lab procedures with you. All right, gentlemen, let's get to work. You never know when that first call's going to come in, so I suggest you take the next few minutes and get your locker straightened away. Oh, I almost forgot. on behalf of the LAPD forensic photo lab, welcome to hell, Mr. Hart. Thanks. [HUMMING] ♪ I got a cockeyed woman ♪ [WHISTLES] Jack. Oh, Jack. [HUMMING] Ta-da! Oh, Jesus. Talk about a chick with a split personality... Well... There's plenty more where she came from. I'm out of here, Jack. Peace in the middle east, and I don't mean Pittsburgh. And I don't mean Pittsburgh. Yeah. "Jean Starr... 555-7239." Wow. What... No fixer? Jack... Looks like we got a body for you. So this is your first body, huh? No, just my first dead one. Oh, yeah. Well, if you start to have a problem, just say what I always say. What's that? It's not me laying down there bleeding, so why the hell should I care? I'll try to remember that. Let's do it. I don't give a damn what your supervisor said. I'm the boss here. I said don't dust it. Bag it, tag it, and file it. That's it. Boots. Frank. Hey, Bootsy. [CAR HONKS HORN] Don't make no big deal out of this. We got no witnesses. Know what we'll end up with? Another goddamn unsolvables. I got enough unsolvables as it is, don't I? Looks like an accident to me, Frank. I like your attitude. I want three shots-- Front, back, one of the burger. That's it. You got it. By the way, watch out for that secret sauce. They tell me that shit is zesty this morning. Hey, who in the hell are you? Get me a uniform over here. What's this guy doing? He's in training. One of your guys at the lab. Yeah, he's cool, Frank. Keep him out of the way. Who was that guy? Frank Deacon, Detective. He's a nice guy when you get to know him. What's his problem? I'm sorry. What were you saying about the detective, and you felt something weird? Remember that time we went to that party on Long Island, and there was a guy there we both thought we recognized, but we couldn't place him? The one who turned out to be the weather man on the local news? I felt the same thing when I saw Deacon. That you'd seen him before on TV? Isabel, you're bugging me. Listen. I'm talking about a feeling, about you knowing someone but not knowing from where. That's interesting. Maybe you dreamed about him. What makes you say that? I don't know. I was only joking. Well, I'm going to get back to work while I'm feeling inspired. Isn't there any of that for me? Oh, I'm sorry, honey. It was only a single serving. Oh, and by the way, lately I find myself siding with the pope on the issue of premarital sex. That's blackmail. How can it be blackmail, Jack? There's nothing of yours I want. Aah! Here, it's yours. All right, but if we're going to have sex, you have to close the door and pull the blinds. The neighbors can see right through the window. [CAMERA SNAPS] Nice window. Let's get a shot of the front. Hey, Mike, give me a hand with the gurney. Where's the body? Oh, we'll get to that. Now, Mr. Hart... Showtime. Uh, is that him? Always makes me wonder if dead men dream. Ahem. Yes? What's the problem? Um, my watch. It just stopped. Let's see it. It just stopped, you say. Mm-hmm. When? Oh, the night before last. Would you mind sharing with me what it was that happened at 5:59 and 51 seconds the night before last? What do you mean? A watch of this quality doesn't just stop of its own accord, sir. Did we drop it, smack it, knock it? I don't know. I mean... I might have bumped it in my sleep or something. Ahh, bumped. We bumped it when we were asleep. Well, as I said, Mr., uh... Hart. Watch this quality doesn't just stop. Fill out a ticket, name and number. I'll see what I can do. Do you have any idea when it might be ready? 5:59 and 52 seconds, Mr. Hart. Until then, time has no meaning, does it? [DING] ♪ Happy barf day to you ♪ Thank you very much. ♪ Happy barf day to you ♪ You shouldn't have, guys. ♪ Happy barf day, dear Jack ♪ Thank you very much. ♪ Happy barf day to you ♪ You shouldn't have, Boots. What the hell's going on out here! Now first things first, Jack. We want you to shoot the whole crime scene in sequence. Start with a wide shot of the scene, then move in for the details. Think of it as a little story, got it? Now these particular negatives were exposed at the site of an armed robbery in Downey. You see the footprint? Mm-hmm. One of the suspects stepped in grease coming in. That would be enough to convict a brother right there. They busted in and surprised the night manager after closing, forced her to open up the safe at gunpoint, then they tied her up with duct tape. Here's where this particular story starts to get good. It just so happens a group of detectives had been running surveillance on these guys for weeks, following them around, and waiting for them to commit a crime. Cops can do that? Why not? These guys were suspects in a whole string of robberies with similar M.O.S. When the suspects returned to the vehicle, money in hand, the detectives were laying for them. One of the suspects brandished a weapon, and the officers opened fire. I guess this next shot tells the whole story. They tried to make a run for it and got cut down, I think in all I counted 24 12-gauge shotgun shells and 19 .45 caliber Magnum casings... Whoa. It was a firestorm. This is the only weapon the police found at the scene. Here. Look at it closely. A marksman repeater? A pellet gun, Jack. The next guy here made it the furthest before the shotgun here took him down. They shot him in the fucking back. He was trying to escape, Jack. It was a massacre. These suspects didn't fire a shot. Gentlemen. Ain't life grand? How's it going in here? Fine, Al. Fine. I hope Mr. Hart hasn't been too much trouble. Not at all, Al. Fast learner, is he? I think Jack's picking up on how things work around here real quick. Did you hear about the one in west Hollywood last night? Uh-uh. Someone cut this guy's unit off, and he bled to death. They searched the apartment all over for it. They couldn't find it. Then finally somebody found it in the kitchen on the stove in a frying pan. It had been cooked. Braised, I think. Woof. Wow. Are you doing the photo competition? I don't know. I hadn't thought about it. If you're going to, you better get cracking because you'll be competing with... This baby. Ooh, wow. That's fantastic, dieter. Hey, this is nothing. Wait till you see what I did with Washington's monument. Toodle-oo, Bubby. See ya. Jean Starr. No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Damn. Hey, baby, Jean Starr’s who you got. To be here to answer the phone, maybe I'm not. I would have tried to stick around if I'd known I was sought. So please leave a message after this thought. [BEEP] Hey, great outgoing message. My name is Jack Hart. I'm a photographer. And, well, I saw some of your work recently. I was wondering if you'd do some modeling over the weekend for me. I'm working on a photo essay-- Jack, lunch? Lunch, yeah. Titled A Woman's Place, and what can I say? I think you'd be perfect for the piece. My number is 555-0493. Well, I finally make it into his office, he opens up my portfolio, looks at it for all of 30 seconds, zips it up, and says in that tiny voice of his, "these were shot a fraction of a second too late." Ouch. You kidding. No, man. Dead serious. How would you like to do some freelance work for the Tribune? Yes. Yes, that would be great as long as it doesn't interfere with my current job. Hey, you're amongst friends here, Jack. What are we talking about? I want you to be straight with me, Jack. Is it starting again? Is what starting again? You know, the whole syndrome-- I pressure you a little, you dangle another woman in my face, I get angry, you call me a jealous bitch. Where is this coming from? I want you to know I can play that game, too. I will not go through it with you again. Who's asking you to? Jean called. Oh, my god. honey, look, she's a model I was thinking of using for a photo contest we're having at work. A photo contest at work. Mm-hmm. What's this about a woman's place? That's the theme of the contest. Don't look at me. I didn't make it up. She didn't say anything about any photo contest, Jack. Well, I didn't tell her. I didn't want to scare her off. I wish you worried that much about scaring me off. Look, Jack, I'm going to the movies, okay? Her address is by the phone in my office. She wanted me to tell you she'll be home all day tomorrow, and you can drop by anytime. What do I have to do to make you trust me? Honey, you know it's not here. Then go and get it. It's at work. I can't get it till Monday. Then call her and cancel. Come on, baby. We can't function that way. Okay. Wait right here. Oh, god. I don't have time for this, Jack. The movie starts in 15 minutes. [SHUFFLING THROUGH CABINETS] What? What are you doing? Will you be my Mrs. Hart? No more games? We're really engaged? You bring the ring home on Monday? Cross my heart. And I hope to kiss you to death. That's a good kisser. Okay, 4136. This is it. Jack, look at this place. She wouldn't live in a place like this. No, this is it. What makes you say that? That garage. I've seen it before in a picture. You still want to set up the shots? You still want me to? You're the one with all the good ideas about a woman's place. You only like me for my brain. Well, somebody's expecting us. Hello! Wow. Check out this mirror. Jack, there are hand-painted murals on the walls in this room, and in the dining room, too. Wow. [SHOWER RUNNING] Jack, don't look. I tried calling you at work, but you had already gone home. So they gave me your home number. You work for the cops, huh? As a photographer. It's a temporary thing just to pay the bills. I guess I'm lucky. I have a husband to do that. You know, this is fascinating work. I didn't know you were a photographer, too. It's all I've ever been. What about your modeling? Well, I shot myself for these, but other than that, this will be the first time that I've ever posed for somebody. So you shot you in the white dress? I don't think I've ever taken a shot in a white dress. I only do nudes. No, no. I saw them. They were in an envelope with your name and phone number, but somebody hadn't fixed them right. When they hit the light, they turned black. Oh, those. You're going way back. They're from when I was just starting. I forgot about them. Starr... Is that your husband's name? No, it's my professional name. So... What did you have in mind, Jack? A woman's place? A woman's place, you know, it's just a departure point. It's a, uh... Ahem. It's a place to begin, to start with. We had all kinds of ideas, but we saw this house, and it just blew us away. So, um... We thought maybe... Jack. So what's the story behind this place? The story? Mm-hmm. How did you come to live here and everything? I don't live here, really. I stay here sometimes when I'm in town. I inherited the place from my mother when she passed away. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be. Nothing really dies, Jack. So would you mind if we took a few shots around here? Whatever you want. I'm here for you. Couldn't ask for more than that. Great. What is this all supposed to mean, anyway? From the moment the bride lies back on the marriage bed to perform her carnal duty to conceive a child, she takes her place among the portraits of her ancestors. After she's performed this vital function, she's no longer part of the present or the future... Oh, my god. But she becomes a part of the past. I'm almost sorry I asked. Ladies, I got to tell you. This has all happened before. That's so weird. I was just thinking the same thing. Yes. This house, that bed, those portraits, the white dress, it was all in the photos I saw of you. What are you talking about? You guys... You guys are playing a trick on me. Isabel put you up to this, didn't she? Isabel, very clever. Ha ha. For just a minute, you had me thinking that I saw these... Quit fooling around, Jack. Take the shot. Quit fooling around, Jack. Take the shot. Yeah, Jack. Take the shot. God. This ought to be an interesting juxtaposition. The perfect bride taking out the garbage. If you're not playing a joke, this is too much. This photograph has already been taken. I've seen it with my own eyes. There won't be any shot at all if you've got the garage in the background. The American dream works great for men, but the bride still takes out the garbage. Did you hear what I said? Just imagine if a woman had to wear the dress she wore on her wedding day every single day the rest of her life. There won't be a shot if you got the garage in the background. No! Was that some kind of reverse psychology? Look what you've done. You're the one, Jack, not me. Stay. Stay right here. [CRYING] Jean? What's the matter? I asked you not to take the shot. I begged you, but you wouldn't listen. You just went ahead and did exactly what she wanted. Aw, Jean, come on. My father committed suicide in that garage. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. When I was 9, he had a bad fight with my mom. So she took me and my sister to my grandma's for the day. Daddy went out to the garage and started the engine. [COUGHING] But something made him change his mind. So he made it to the garage door, but he fell on the floor and cracked his head open. Oh, Jean. When we got home, there was just that... Little trickle of blood... Did you hear what I said? Coming from under that big door. Oh. Oh, Jean. Mm-hmm. That's how it's done. What the hell are you doing in here, Hart? Do you have any idea how much each sheet of that paper costs the department? It's just an experiment for the photo contest. You'll be going out on a 187, solo, in approximately 12 minutes. Okay. I suggest you get your ass in gear, Mr. Hart. Give me a wide shot. How about a medium on the passenger door? Give me one from right here where the gun was, okay? ♪ Take a bullet in the brain ♪ ♪ Away goes trouble down the drain ♪ Jack Hart... Detective Frank Deacon. Remember me? How can I forget? Hope there's no hard feelings about last time, Jack. No, I'm a big boy. I understand your situation. You know, these guys got less than 20 bucks. Bastards. Makes you want to-- Makes you want to what, Jack, buy a gun, become a vigilante? No. Move to Montana. You know, life's a vicious circle, Jack. I bet good money that the trigger man in this deal served a stint in gladiator school, learned a few things from his classmates, came out promising himself that on the next job he'd leave no witnesses. No wits, no crime. I take it you don't believe in rehabilitation, Detective. Call me Frank. You take it right. These guys don't give a damn if they get caught. What's the worse that can happen? They go back to prison where they can hang with their homeboys, right? You think prison's a deterrent? Ha! Most of these guys like it inside-- Three squares a day, basketball, weightlifting, color television. So what's the solution, Frank? Pow. Hi, honey. Just let me finish this paragraph. I'm totally in a groove. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] Hello. Jack, this is Jean. I just wanted to call and apologize for Saturday. That's okay. You don't have to explain. I understand. Do you? Yeah, sure. Really? Jack, something is unspoken here, and I think we should get together and talk. Well, talk away. I'm listening. Okay. Remember what you said at my house about how it felt like everything had happened before? Yeah. Well, you were right, and I can explain. Well, explain away. I'm listening. No. It's got to be in person, away from her, and bring the photographs. [DIAL TONE] Oh, my. Honey, honey, honey. The photo lab just called, and there's been a big accident. They want me to come in. I'll see you when you get home. [RATTLING] [CAMERA SNAPS] Ahem. What are you doing, trying to kill yourself? Shh. Do you hear it, Jack? Hear what? Somewhere way in the very back of your head, isn't there a tiny little voice talking to you right now? A tiny little voice that keeps saying, "she's perfect for me. "She's the answer to my dreams and prayers. She could be every woman to me." The only tiny little voice I hear is the one that keeps asking me where your old man is. San Francisco. That's where he lives, where we live. I come and go as I please. How convenient. That's exactly what it is, Jack. Nothing more, nothing less. Then, uh... Why do you stay? Why do you stay with Isabel? Why? You want to see my darkroom? I built it myself. I might as well. I mean... As long as I'm here. Hey, pretty nice. Is this where you printed those shots of you I found at work in my locker? I didn't take those shots, Jack. You did. Wait a minute. You said before-- I lied. You lied? I lied because Isabel was around, and she would never understand. Understand what, Jean? That you saw the future in those photographs. It was destiny bringing us together. Excuse me. For a second I think I forgot, but... Just exactly what universe are we talking about here, Jean? If you don't believe me, why are you here? Why don't you just leave? You really loved me once, Jack. [COUGHING] Excuse me? You did, and you know it. You felt it the moment you laid eyes on me... We both did. Something old, strong, and deep. Now you can have me back... But you have to want me more than anything else in this world. [GASPING FOR BREATH] Ahh. Oh. Ay yi yi yi yi. Fuck me, Jack. It will all come back. Oh. [UNBUCKLING BELT] Oh. Oh! Oh. Oh, no, please. I'm ready. Oh. Oh. Oh! Ho-ho! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh! Aah! Oh. There's somebody there. I got it. I got it. I got it. Oh, you scared the living shit out of me. You're a little jumpy yourself. There must be a reason. Yeah. You screamed. Is there something you're not telling me? Oh, get off it. No. I haven't said anything. But it's been over a week now. You still haven't brought home the ring. Have you changed your mind, fallen in love with somebody else? You wake up screaming, "there's someone in the room," and you ask me about another woman? I should be asking you the same thing. You know I could never be unfaithful. And you have been unfaithful. And you're never going to let me live that down, are you? Look, is there somebody else? 'Cause I would understand if there was. Things have been hard lately. I've been preoccupied with my writing. You're frustrated at work. No. It's not about that. Oh, my god. I was right. No, Isabel, honey. Honey, it's not what you think, Isabel. Isabel... Honey... Nothing... Nothing has happened. I mean, I--I... I have been tempted... But nothing has happened. Who? Who is she, Jack? We're not going to accomplish anything by discussing this, really. You make me powerless by withholding from me. You're deciding whether or not you want to be in a relationship with me, and I don't even know it! Why do you always have to be in control? Oh, baby, come here. Oh, now. Come on. Come on. Just stop this. Just stop this. Do you want to break up with me, Jack? Ahh. Um... I'm not sure. Well, if we're going to break up, you're going to have to do it. I came to this godforsaken city to be with you. I built my life around you. I cannot--I will not break up with you. Who is she, Jack? You can tell me. I won't get mad. You're writing a book about her. You bastard! How long have you known her, for one fucking second? Just as long as you have. Don't you even get near me, fucker! You're just as obsessed with her as I am. I warned you. I'm leaving. When I get back, I want all your shit out of here. If you're happy with that spaced-out, fucking bimbo, don't expect me to be waiting patiently when you finally realize that slut can't carry on a simple fucking, logical conversation. Oh. [POUNDING] Damn it. Where the hell is she? God damn it. He's yours, Al. Get him under control, god damn it! Good morning, Frank. Fuck you. What's wrong with him? What can you tell me about this, Jack? [BRAKES SQUEAL] Can't you fucking read? It says, "police line-- Do not cross." No fucking press. I'm the police photographer, man. Where's your I.D.? It's in the car. Jack! Hot damn, Jack Hart! So we meet again. I didn't take the photograph, Al. Detective Deacon seems to think otherwise. Deacon's got a bug up his ass. Go through my negatives. I didn't shoot that. Look, I'm going to be straight with you on this. Got kind of a funny situation here. How can I help? We'll talk about that in a minute. Can I help you gentlemen? I swear to god, Al. I did not take that shot. I'm still on probation. I'd be an idiot to pull that stunt. Well, to make a long story short, one thing led to another, and the guy resisted arrest. Sounds like an open and shut case to me. Exactly, but, well, you see... Here's where the shit starts getting deep. See that kid up there on the steps? Mm-hmm. He's not the suspect that we were in pursuit of. It's at least possible this photograph could have been taken by a journalist outside the police line, but a forensic analyst will determine the distance the photographer was from the subject. If the distance he determines falls inside the police line, then we've got a little problem, haven't we? Now, if you could see clear to downplay the corpse's youth-- Frame out high-top tennie runners and basketball, maybe. Now, if you could just see your way clear to do that for us, Jack, well, then, I'd owe you a big one. No problem, Frank. No problem at all. You got to believe me. I'd love to believe you, Jack. I really would. But I have to ask you to take the day off. We'll have the information we need for a decision this time tomorrow. You be in my office. Aah! Somebody killed my baby! Somebody killed my baby! No! Aah! Oh! No! Get away! My baby! Oh! [CLICK] Shit! That ain't my baby! [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] Hello? Oh, thank god. Jack, is that you? Where have you been for the last... Two weeks, Jean? Out of town on a job, why? What's wrong? I couldn't take it anymore. I told Isabel everything. Jack, where are you? Would you like to come over? [TIRES SQUEAL] Jack, there's something I have to tell you. Yes? I talked to my husband. He's coming to L.A. tomorrow. He says he's taking me back to San Francisco with him. I really--I really-- I really don't know what's left to say. I mean, I felt as if I'd been given one last chance to really and truly love somebody completely, without any doubts or any regrets. Stop. Stop it. Now I feel-- Don't say anymore. You're breaking my heart. [SIGHS] Okay, listen... It was fate that brought us together, I know you don't believe that, but why don't we let fate determine what happens to us now? What are we doing? I'll write 10... And you write 10. We'll pick five and do exactly what they say. Okay. Okay. We'll each pick one until we've got five. You go first. ♪ Da da da-ta da dickety da ♪ "Make love till we puke." [IMITATES CROWD] Yay. "Get married before we know each other"? Good idea. "Stay in bed for a year." As the crowd goes wild. Yes. "Make babies"? It'll take practice. These are all yours. I know. I know. I know. I know. Okay, one more. One more. [IMITATES TRUMPET PLAYING CALL TO POST] Ta-da! Ooh. Ahh. [RING CLATTERS] Ah--ow. Ah. Ow. Jack, don't. Jack, no. I'll never get it off. Don't. No. Ah. Ow. As fate intended it. Now I can never take it off. We're entering into something far more powerful than either of us know. It's not going to be easy, Jack. There will be forces working against us. Forces like... What kind of forces? Like my husband. He told me once that he was so attracted to me that he would fuck my dead body. I would, too, Jean. [RATTLING] Ahem. [COUGHING] [TOILET FLUSHING] [COUGHING] Come on, Jean. [SNORING] Why aren't you naked? I'm cold. What? Jack, don't. Let's just go to sleep. Okay. Let's go to sleep. I'm sorry. It's just... I've gotten a--a little rash, and I'm afraid it might be contagious. Oh, my god. Is there anything you want to tell me, Jean? No. It's just so weird. All of a sudden, it just appeared on the palm of my hand. On the palm of your hand? Yeah. What? You don't believe me? Ay yi yi. Oh, honey. There's a little bit of it on my back. Well, let me see. Yeesh. Oh, baby. Oh, my goodness. I'm freaked out, Jack. Please. I'm going to go to the doctor first thing tomorrow morning. I promise. Just think how much better it would be if we wait. Put your sock back on, baby. Good night, Jean. Good night. [GRUMBLING] [GRUMBLING] [GRUMBLING] [SQUISH SQUISH] [GRUMBLING] - Aah! Ah! Ah! - [CHOMP] Man, man! My hand. Oh. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh. Jack Hart? Who's asking? Please, I can tell by the expression on your face that you recognized me immediately. I'm not here to play macho games with you. Then it was nice not meeting you. There's something you should know. My wife is a very sick woman. She's been in and out of mental hospitals her whole adult life. I don't care. You are by no means the first man she's latched onto in this manner. The temptation's almost overwhelming, isn't it? You want her so badly, you're willing to overlook her fantasies, perhaps even buy into some. What fantasies? What are you talking about? Well, let me guess. You were lovers in a past life, separated by fate. Reunited for eternity. How am I doing, Mr. Hart? But the photographs. What about the photographs? Oh, the photographs. Now, let me see. I suppose you received them in the mail. Two bits of blank photographic paper that turn black once exposed to the light? I saw an image. It was of Jean. You saw what you wanted to see, just as you saw what you wanted to see when you fell in love with her. It's all part of the game. I commend you on your willingness to listen to reason. Most of Jean's victims put up with a considerable amount of unsavory resistance. I can only wish you luck. You say the photographer was outside the police line? Yes. Are you sure? Well, Jack... Got some good news. The calculation of our analyst Mr. Liebovitz places the photographer who took that shot that appeared in the Tribune well outside the police line. So that puts you in the clear. I trust there'll be no hard feelings over the incident? No. All right. Then I expect everything to be business as usual from here on in. Sure. Any questions, Jack? [DOOR OPENS] I fucked up. I really and truly fucked up. Watch this. I'm closing the door. Watch this. I'm closing the blinds. Forgive me. Forgive me. How can I, Jack? Ahh. Marry me. Marry me. Marry me. Thank you, Isabel. It's not going to be easy, Jack. You're going to have to try harder than ever before. I know. Ahem. I will. Your lover has invaded my dreams. Every night, no matter what I dream, there she is. I'm so sorry. You've turned me into a murderer. What? Last night I dreamt that I-- I tracked her down. I watched her. I watched her for a long, long time. I watched her wash her perfect white body. I watched her wash her perfect blond hair. I watched her apply her perfect makeup in the mirror, and, finally, just when she was putting on the finishing touches... I snuck up. I snuck up, and I bashed her perfect face in. I smashed her perfect face against the mirror into the blood, and the skin and the hair and the makeup were all a perfect muddy pulp. Perfect. If you kill someone in your dream, are you guilty of murder? No. Don't you think you willfully, morally, and psychologically have proven your capacity to kill? [TELEPHONE RINGS] It's for you. - [RING] - Yeah. Right. Soup is great. [RING] Hello. Hello. [JEAN] Oh, how serene. I wish I was there to see the reunited lovers beam. I think you have the wrong number. Come home, darling. Isabel's going to-- Ahem. Wrong number. What did they say? Oh, it was just some crazy woman. Jean? Wasn't it? You have a secret code or something. You're going to rendezvous with her. No, of course not. It's what I told you. It's a wrong number. [TIRES SQUEAL] [WHAM] Je-Jesus Christ. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing. I'm going with you! No. You stay right here. Oh. [CLEARS THROAT] My, my, aren't we in a big hurry? I fucking knew it. Would you excuse us, please? I need to speak with my fiancé in private? Oh, my god. Don't you think I'm in this, too? Very well. We've got a little bun in the oven. Oh, my god. Bullshit. She's lying. That's just some bizarre attempt to trap you. Look at her! It's true. I'm not absolutely sure yet, but the first test came back positive. I'm having another one in a week. No, no. This is too much. Jean, Jean... Uh, what are you going to do if you are pregnant? What do you mean? She'll have an abortion. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about, Jack. I filed for a divorce today, and I'm seriously thinking about having it. Oh, my god. If you think this little ruse will drive me away, you've got another thing coming. Maybe the three of us could raise it together, Isabel. Oh, my god. She can't. Jack, tell her she can't have your baby. Isabel, you can't tell someone to have an abortion. Well, I have nothing against you, Isabel, and if Jack can't seem to live without you, then I'm willing to work something out. You're insane, Jean. Hee hee. In-fucking-sane. Jackie... Hon. Our baby will be the purest expression of two people's love that the world has ever seen. Get out of my house! You know, I could love you, too, Isabel. Forget it! Just forget it! I can't believe you actually fucked her. She's a complete spaceshot! I made a mistake. A mistake? Cutting your balls off shaving would be a mistake, too. You made a cosmic blunder. Okay, okay. Go to her and tell her she can't have that baby. What am I supposed to do? Make her have an abortion? I guess you'll just have to. If I antagonize her, who knows what she'll do? You saw her. She's crazy. She'll--she'll have the baby just to spite me. If she can't be part of my life, she'll ruin it. Good. You deserve it. Do what you have to do, but don't come back here until you've done it! Where'd she get the ring? Who knows? A box of fucking crackerjacks. That was your grandma's ring. You were supposed to give that ring to me. That ring was mine. It was mine! You are the single most sadistic... Thoughtless asshole that ever lived! You've ruined my life, Jack Hart. I swear to god, if there's any justice in this world, you will go to hell for it! Go to hell? I'm in hell. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. [SIREN] [FOOTSTEPS] Hey, how's it going? Great. Really great. What the fuck is your problem? Hi. Good morning. You called and said my watch is ready. Yeah. Get it out of here. What? It's there on the counter. Take it. But it's still broken. Oh, no, Mr. Hart. It's far from broken. It's bewitched. Every part is in perfect working condition, and there's nothing out of place, but it refuses to run. Get it out of my shop before it infects the others. Are you out of your mind? You tell me what happened at 5:59 and 51 seconds, you tell me that, I can fix your watch. Till then, get out. Get out! Get out! We now return you to Laurel Canyon. Oh, Grant, you mean this torture's finally over? Darling, from now on, it's just you and I... In our Laurel Canyon. Oh, how serene. Look at the reunited couple beam. Oh, my god. Will you excuse us, Gwen? My fiancé and I must talk. I'm not going anywhere. I'm in this, too, Grant. Very well. Grant, I think we're a tiny bit pregnant. Look at her. She's lying. She's trying to trap you, Grant. Oh, it's true. I'm not absolutely sure, but the test did come back positive. I'll take another one next week. What do you plan to do if you are... pregnant, Missy? What do you mean? She'll get rid of it. Gwen, enough. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I filed for divorce today, and I'm thinking of seriously having our baby. If you think this will drive me away, you have another thing coming. Maybe we can raise it together. Tell her she can't have it, Grant. She can't have it. Gwen, I'm a pro-life activist. I don't actually have anything against you. If Grant can't seem to live without you, we'll just have to sacrifice. You're insane, Missy. Maybe... But imagine how wonderful that little child will be when we raise it together. Get out of my house. You know... Ohh. I think I could learn to love you, too, Gwen. Oh, my god. I love this. Yeah. Laurel Canyon... will be right back. Jack. Yeah? You get everything in there? Uh, yeah, I think so. What about the bathroom? Oh, uh... No. I think I forgot. Um... It'll only take a second. Okay. Say peace. Okay. Ah, Mr. Hart. Would you please try to discourage your various admirers from treating the photo lab as your mailing address? Thank you. Jack? Yes? Do you remember the night you gave me this ring, what we said, what we felt? I, uh... I wanted to marry you. And we knew it wasn't going to be easy. We knew there were powerful forces working against us, that we'd have to be strong, or we'd lose everything that we felt between us. Do you remember, Jack? I remember. And what happened? I got scared. I stopped believing. Why, Jack? Well... First there was the rash. It's gone. It disappeared. Yeah, well... Then--then I had this dream. Oh, I had a dream. I dreamt... that you had this crack in your head. Where? And then... your husband came over. I knew it. That bastard. He told me about the blank photo paper, Jean. It was a promotional gimmick. I sent out hundreds of them. It brought us together, didn't it? It doesn't change what you saw. Jack, wait. I want to show you something. Oh, my god. He told you I was crazy, didn't he? Yes. He told you I'd done this kind of thing, tricking men into loving me over and over. He told you anything he could think of to scare you off. How would he explain your dream? You didn't know I had a birthmark. How could you have dreamt about that? Because, um... Because this has all happened before. - Exactly. - Exactly. Jack... Would you do something for me if I asked you to? Oh, Jean. Would you give me one more chance to make you believe? Uh... Ahem. Of course. Wait here until I call for you. [THUNDER] The third shot is the key, Jack. We have a chance to change our destiny, but first we have to finish the photo sequence my way. I want you inside me now. You. You! Do you, Jack, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife... I do. I do. To have and to hold... Yes! Yes! From this day forward... For better or for worse... Yeah. Yeah. For richer, for poorer... I do, Jean. I do. In sickness and in health... I'll never leave you, Jean. Till death do us part? Oh, god. Make me your wife, Jack. Come inside me. Oh, give me a child. Oh, Jean. Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean, let go. Let go. Jean, Jean. What's happening? Why are you leaving? Let go. Aah! You lied to me! You were never pregnant! Isabel was killing your soul! I lied to save you from her! Bullshit! What about the ring? Keep it. Jack! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Isabel. Son of a bitch. Yah! [DING] Jack... Hey, Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack. It's all cleared with the head cheese here. Breakfast is on moi this morning, pal. Jack, Detective Deacon seems to feel that, in light of what's transpired over the last few days, your working relationship with him would benefit through a gesture of reconciliation. That's nice. That's awfully nice, Frank, but... I'm not a breakfast guy. Hey, Jack, Jack, come on now. This is a done deal, pal. I won't take no for an answer. Anywhere you want, as long as it's drive-thru, because we got a 187 waiting at Palos Verdes. Ah, goody. Jack, you left this on the bench last night. Ah, forgetful me. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Have fun, gentlemen. [BEEP] - [BEEP] - Hi, Isabel. It's Claudio. - Claudio? - I just wanted to call and tell you again what a great, great time I had. Great, great time? What more can I say? I'm just thinking about you, baby. Thinking of you, baby? - Thinking of you, baby? - [BEEP] Baby, baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! My god! Baby, baby, baby. Baby this. Baby, baby, baby. Claudio. Claudio. Claudio. Claudio. Hey, great time. Great, great time. "Anne, Cindy..." Ah, Mr. Claudio. Mr. Claudio. Okay. [RING] [HORN HONKS] You are playing straight with me, right? I mean... You're not just spooking me, are you, Jack? Absolutely not. As far as I'm concerned, you and I will be do-si-doing for the rest of time. Did we get any salt? [RING] Hello? Isabel there? Hold on a second. Jack, what are you doing? I love you, Isabel. I made a terrible mistake. I want to devote myself to making you happy. I'm sorry, Jack. It's too late for that. You destroyed everything we had. I want my own life back. Isabel, it's never too late. Honey, let's go home. I want to get out of this hellhole. Look, I got to go. I don't want to hear from you ever again. As far as I'm concerned, you're dead. Isabel. Isabel, no, I'm not dead. I'm not dead. [ Repeats ] I'm not dead. [RING] [RING] [RING] Mm-mmm. Looks appetizing. [RING] - [RING] - Well, let's eat her before she gets cold. [ISABEL] How did you get this number, Jack? I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me. Get that bitch to help. She's the mother of your child. She wasn't pregnant. She said that to scare you. She wins. I hope you're happy with her. She's dead, Isabel. Listen, listen. She killed herself and made it look like-- You couldn't stop lying if you tried, Jack. No. Wait. Please listen. No. You listen. I'm through being manipulated by you, being pulled around like some kind of puppet. It's your turn to hurt now. Where are you, Isabel? Goodbye, Jack... Forever. No! No! - [DIAL TONE] - Isabel! Isabel! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Talk to me! Talk to me! Talk to me! I got your number now, Claudio. [GRUNTING] [RING] What's the matter, pal? Thought you was an old hand at this. Fuck you, you bastard. I beg your pardon. What'd you say to me, you little shit? [RING] Why? Why? Ooh... Why did she have to go and do that? - [RING] - Oh, why? - [CLICK] - Listen, Jack, and listen carefully. Isabel never wants to see or hear from you again. Is that clear? This is none of your fucking business, Claudio. Want to make a fucking bet? You ever touch or harass her in any way, I will break your fucking neck. Hey-- - [DIAL TONE] - By god! God. Shit. Shit. Shit. - [PUSHING BUTTONS] - Ughh. [RING] - [CLICK] - Listen, you-- Hi. This is Claudio. I'm not in... I got to warn you. Your erratic behavior is attracting suspicion, Mr. Hart. - Care to comment? - Yeah! Go fuck yourself, Deacon! Look... I'm sorry if I said something insensitive back there. Jack... Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Come on. Let's get back to the car. I'm not going back there. I've had enough. I've had enough. Damn it! God damn it! I'll take you anyplace you want to go, buddy. You just say the word. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Ahh. Ahh. I gathered from your reaction back there that, uh... you knew the victim, Jack. Well, you gathered wrong. Aah-ha! Ahh. What happened at... 5:59 and 51 seconds, Mr. Hart? Huh? What happened? I'll tell you what... Fucking happened! Aah! Yaah! What in hell's going on, Frank? I'm going to ask you one more time, Jack. Did you or did you not know Jean Starr? I don't have the faintest idea who you're talking about, Frank. There it is, Frank. I saw him working on them myself. He had them hidden in the trunk of his car. May god have mercy on your soul, Mr. Hart. You know what purgatory is, Jack? Uh-huh. You're in it, and you'll stay in it until you quit making the same stupid fucking mistake over and over again! There's nothing there to hurt me. We don't have to go through this song and dance. Tell me the truth and be done with it. Wouldn't that be a relief, Jack? Check it out, Frank. The suspense is killing me. Okay. You got me. I admit it. I worked with Jean briefly as a model for the contest. That's all there is to it. End of story. That's real coincidental, isn't it, Jack? I mean, a wedding dress and all? She killed herself. She was crazy. Are you sure there isn't something you're leaving out? Uh-uh. What are we going to do about this, Jack? Look... I slept with her a couple of times, okay? She was a freak. I tried to break up with her, she, uh... She kills herself and frames me. She did a damn good job of it, too. No. Even better than that. I might even go so goddamn far as to say it's perfect, Jack. I'm innocent, and you know it. Sure, you are. You're going to take it in the neck. You rubbed all the right people the wrong goddamn way. We know all about your little affair with Miss Starr. Oh, I admit. We haven't figured out what you did with the finger yet, but we will. The finger? What finger? Playing dumb doesn't become you, Jack. We've got enough on you. I could ice your ass right here and now. There wouldn't be a goddamn inquiry. Seeing's how we're such great pals and all, I'm going to give you a nice little head start. Oh, Frank. Now get out of this goddamn car and run! Run! Stop the car! Stop the car! Aah! - [HORN HONKS] - What are you waiting for? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Shoot the motherfucker! Get him! Get him! Don't shoot! [DIAL TONE] [RING] [CLICK] Hi. This is Claudio. I'm not in right now... But if you leave a message, I'll get back to you. Thanks. Bye. - [BEEP] - Okay. I guess it's my turn to talk. All I need is something to say. Let me say... [BELCH] What can I say? Isabel... Isabel, Isabel, Isabel. Oh, dear Isabel. It's funny how things work out, isn't it? One minute you tell me you could never leave me, you tell me it's all up to me, and the next minute, you moved in with Mr. Claudio. How sweet. How sincere. I hope you two have a wonderful life together. I hope this is finally the real thing for both of you. I hope you don't mind building your new lives on my rotting corpse. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I didn't mean any of it. I want to be honest. Ooh. I want to get at the truth. I--I know... I have been a terrible bastard... And thought only about myself, did exactly what I wanted to without thinking of anyone else. And now... Oh, god. Now it's time to pay... To pay the price. Don't you see, Isabel? God. Jean is the devil. She tricked me. She tricked me into believing that she could fill the shoes of the woman lurking... down there... in my brain. She tricked me into thinking that she was different... That the rules didn't apply to her. For just one minute, honey, I believed her. I wanted to so badly. God, I wanted to believe her. Now I know. That woman doesn't exist. She's only perfect 'cause I can't quite see her. She's a shadow. She's a tease designed to torture me. She's the one love that I can never have. There will always be something in my brain, though, honey, something that says... her! Now it's her. Now it's... Her! Oh, Isabel. Won't you save me? [ISABEL] Quit fooling around, Jack. [JEAN] Take the shot. Quit fooling around. Won't you save me? Quit fooling around, Jack. Won't you save me? Take the shot, Jack. Won't you save me? Take the shot, Jack. Just one last time. Quit fooling around, Jack. Take the shot, Jack. Isabel, please. Yeah, take the shot, Jack. Okay. Okay, okay. Then I'll see you in hell, honey. All of you. [BUZZING] No! Welcome to hell, Mr. Hart. No! [DIAL TONE] [OFF-THE-HOOK SIGNAL BEEPING] Take it easy. Take it easy. Hey, Frank, he's moving. I don't know what to tell you, Jack. It is you laying there bleeding this time. Deacon. Jeez, Jack. Looks like your whole life just... Passed in front of your eyes, buddy. Your men shot at me, Frank. Oh, hell, those were only blanks. You clocked me a pretty good one yourself, pal. I thought you'd kill me. And that's exactly what I wanted you to think. I had a feeling that you didn't do it. I figured if we wound you up a little and pushed you off in the right direction, you'd show us who did. I tried to kill myself, Frank. Okay, okay. So... Maybe my plan got a little out of hand. If it's any consolation, pal, we got a good clean collar on this one. Looks like you were right, Frank. Looks like she scrubbed it pretty good, but we're picking up traces of blood in the cracks. I'd say she wanted that ring pretty bad... To kill somebody and chop their damn finger off for it. Isabel. Isabel. [SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING] I was hoping to spare you this, but it turns out Claudio lives in the apartment below you. They got the music turned up so loud, they can't hear a thing. My god. I don't see any harm in waiting till they're done. I mean, even a condemned man, or in this case, woman, Gets a last meal, right? Oh, my head. One last thing, Jack. What's that, Frank? Do the world a favor. Don't ever fall in love again, okay, pal? I'll do my best, Frank. That's my boy. See you at work first thing Monday morning. Like I said, Frank... Hey, Boots. Don't let her get you down. There's more where she came from. [SIREN BLARES] [WATCH TICKING] So what's the story with the watch? You really want to know?
