Big brother, is that the way to America over there? No, this is the way. This way? They say that if you dig a hole- -you'll come out on the other side ofthe world. America is on the other side ofthe world. -But you can't just do that. -Why not? You just said you could. Because inside the earth, there's a fire. -Is it a big fire? -Yes, big and hot. Really? Big brother... I was sleeping. I just wanted to make sure you were still there. Of course I am. Where did you think I was going? Go back to sleep. Big brother... When is mother coming home? Do you think she'll be home for my birthday? Go back to sleep. -Mother! -Badong? I'm so happy to hear your voice! How are you? Mother, I have something important to tell you. Manuel misses you. I miss him too. I think of you both all the time. I'm OK, but Manuel is so young. He wants you to come home for his birthday. I want that too, my son. Don't worry. I bought lots of toys and put them in a box. -What do you think he might like? -He likes basketball. Is that so? I'll buy him a basketball. But when are you coming home for real? My brother misses you so much. Do you know what you can do for him? Take your brother to visit our new home. You can show him what it will look like when I come back. Show him where his room will be, and yours and mine too. If you do that, my boy- -you'll make your brother happy. That would make me happy too. I'm coming home soon and we'll all live together. I love you so much. You're very good and I'm so proud of you. Good morning. This is the living room. The sofa will be there and the TV here. Will the floor look like this? They'll put a carpet on it. That will make it nicer, right? Why are there no windows? It's not finished. Uncle will put windows in. Why is this so rough? Are they going to paint it? When our house is done, it'll be as nice as that one. But why isn't there a roof? They'll put one on. It's not finished yet. -Uncle, when will the house be done? -I don't know. Mother said I should tell you to hurry up. -Your mother said that? -Yes. Well then, tell your mother to send more money. The roof could have been finished this week- -but I couldn't pay the workers. You tell her that. In the name ofthe Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. May the Lord be with you. May the sacrifice we have offered renew our spirit. For the sake of your Son... May the peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each other the sign of peace. My name is Jackie. Nanny Gloria. Ears... Nose... Eyebrows... Eyes... Hand... -Blanket... -Yes, blanket. Blouse... -Foot... -Foot, yes. Calf... I wonderwhat mother is doing in America right now. -I don't know. Maybe she's sleeping. -Sleeping? But it's noon already! -It's nighttime in America. -Nighttime? If it's daytime in the Philippines, it's nighttime in America. I didn't know that. How long will she be staying there? Why are you asking all these questions? I'm just thinking of her. We'll be all grown up by the time she gets back. What? But I'm still a little boy. She'll come home when we're done with school and have jobs. It's Salvador. I want you to come home! What's happened? Is there a problem? No, you just need to come home. I know you need to earn money for the new house and everything- -but I'm bigger now. I can help you. I'll work and make money so that you can come home. No. I'm the one that's going to work for you and your brother. I love you so much. You must be strong. Stop crying, alright? -You have to come home. -Please don't cry. You have to be strong. -Come home! -I love you and Manuel so much. -Do you need help? -No, ask him. You're too young and fishing is hard work. I can help with the fishing nets. No, we can take care of it. Perhaps when you're older... Good day. I was wondering, could I work here? That's not possible. You're too young. I'm good at cooking, I always help my grandma at home. -It's not possible... Go away. -I'm a fast learner. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon to you. I'm just wondering if there's work for me here. See this sack of rice... It must be emptied. Put this plastic bag on the scale. You're going to repack the rice. Each plastic bag should weigh 1 kilo. Put the rice in the plastic bag, like this. Just make sure the scale needle doesn't go past number one. It doesn't matter if it goes under the line, but not over. Mother, I can't do this any longer. Gloria, I know you can do it. You're strong. I feel like my chest will explode. Mother, I'll never get used to this. Not ever! This is not what God wants. You feel that way now. but I believe it's God's will- -that you give your children a betterfuture. No, mother! God wants me to be with my children. Can you understand that? -I want to come home. -No... I miss my children. Be strong my child, you can do it. Try to be strong. I know you can do it. I'm done now. -Are you finished? -Yes. -Is the sack empty? -Yes. Let me see. You're a really good boy. Wait, l'll go inside. I have a reward for you. Here you are... Some candy and mangojuice. -That's your favourite, isn't it? -Yes, thank you. You're a really nice boy, a hard working boy. You like that, don't you? I just wanted to ask how... What? -How much will you pay me? -Pay you? -I'm not giving you any money. -But you must pay me. -I did all of this. - Did you help me for money? Get out of here. Shame on you! Are you trying to trick me? Go on, leave! Shame on you! I'm not that easily fooled! -And no sex? -No. -Nothing? -No. -Where is he from? -America. I love Americans. I hate them, but this one was different. -You hate Americans? -Why? They think they're so good in bed. The Italians are worse. Yes, they think they're so good, they shouldn't have to pay. -But the Germans are the worst. -The Germans? They're OK. They're dirty. No, not all ofthem. But the Arabs... The Arabs are the worst of all. -I wouldn't go with them. -Nobody would. They stink. How about the Japanese? I wouldn't go with them. No way, not with a Jap... I hate the Japanese. You wouldn't because their dicks are the size of my little finger. My little finger, not yours. I'm going to look for him tomorrow. I know where he lives. Time to get up! We're going somewhere today. Hurry up and get dressed. Wake up! -But I have school today. -You're not going to school. I'll be your teacher today. This is yours... ...and this is yours. Tell your brother's teacher he's home sick today. So you've worked for that old miserly cheat! Rita told me everything. -I take good care ofyou, don't I? -Yes, grandmother. So why do you keep calling your mother to complain? Do you know where we're going? Let's go. Look at them. This is what they do every day. Look at those kids. Is this the kind of life you want? Look, he's only your age and he's already collecting garbage. -Here's some bread, eat it! -I don't want it. Why not? You haven't eaten anything today. Go on, eat it! Do you know why your mother is working in America? So you won't have to eat this bread. So that you can have a good life. A good life, proper food, nice house. A good education. Money, so when you get sick you can go to the doctor. Those kids can't go to the doctor. When they get sick, they just die. Theyjust die. Are you enjoying your ice cream? We should pity those people who live in the dumpsite. No one should have to live in a place like that. You know, there's something worse happening here at night. Kids come here to sell themselves. -Sell themselves? -They sell themselves to tourists. They buy kids and take them to their hotels. Why are they taking the kids to their hotels? I don't know, they just want someone to sleep with. Do they get paid? What else do they do? Let's not talk about it. They just sleep, nothing else. They don't do anything, they just sleep there. Just eat your ice cream. Hey, that's my bike. What are you doing with it? -It's mine now. -It's not yours, it's ours. Your slippers... take them off. -Take off your clothes. -Do you have any money? You're new around here, don't be a show off! Hey, go away! Wake up! It's time to eat soon. -Have you seen your brother? -No. -Have you seen Salvador? -No. It's very early and he's not here. I wonder where he is. He's probably just hanging out with the neighbours. -Are you sure you haven't seen him? -Yes. -Have you seen Badong? -No, I haven't. He's not in his room and his bike is missing. Big brother! -Miss, have you seen Badong? -No, I haven't. OK. Thank you. There's a child here! He's bleeding. Help me! Check his pulse. Call an ambulance. Hurry up! Where is he? He's still breathing. Help me carry him. We need a tricycle! Hello... Gloria, is that you? My dear daughter, I don't know how to say this... ...but something's happened to Salvador. -This is a very nice pen. -I'm not really interested in pens. I'll give you 25 dollars for all of these, you'll get less elsewhere. -Only 25 dollars? -25, max. I can't give you more. This one's a copy. Okay, I'll give you 30. That's my last offer. Agreed? I'm here now, my son. I will never leave you again. Never ever. How are you, my sweet one? Are you not asleep yet? I miss you. Do you miss me? I'll be coming to see you soon. I promise to come and see you. Are you falling asleep? Do you want me to sing you a lullaby? Close your eyes And have a sweet dream, my dear child I'll be here to protect you and to watch over you
