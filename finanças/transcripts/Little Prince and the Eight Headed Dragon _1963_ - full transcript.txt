TOEI COMPANY LTD. This is a story of long, long ago, before our world was formed. In the age of the Ancient Gods, The Lord of the Universe, Ame-no-Minakanushi, called forth Izanagi and Izanami. He bade them to create a world where people could live and be happy. Izanagi and Izanami descended with a great spear, with which they stirred the sea. As they withdrew the spear, a drop fell from its tip and formed many islands. an Ancient Japanese Fairytale The LITTLE PRINCE and the EIGHT-HEADED DRAGON Producer: Hiroshi Okawa Associate Producers: Shin Yoshida, Isamu Takahashi, Takashi Iijima Screenplay: Ichiro Ikeda, Takashi Iijima Animation Supervisor: Sanae Yamamoto Music: Akira Ifukube Animation Director: Yasuji Mori Animation: Hideo Furusawa, Masao Kumagawa, Yasuo Otsuka, Daikichiro Kusube, Makoto Nagasawa, Reiko Okuyama, Masatake Kita, Chikao Katsui Inbetween Animation: Sadao Tsukioka, Yoichi Kotabe, Tomekichi Takeuchi, Norio Hikone, Katsuya Oda, Tetsuta Ikuno, Noboru Sekiai, Akemi Ota, Kyoko Nakatani, Kazuko Kobayashi, Mochitsugu Yoshida, Toshio Katsuta, Takao Kodama, Yoshio Aiso, Sadao Kikuchi, Satoru Saito, Nobuyuki Fukushima, Hideki Mori, Toshio Hirata Art Director: Reiji Koyama Color Design: Saburo Yokoi Historical Research: Koji Fukiya Backgrounds: Tomo Fukamoto, Eiko Sugimoto, Isamu Kageyama, Hideo Chiba Camera: Mitsuaki Ishikawa, Hideaki Sugawara Editing: Ikuzo Inaba Sound Recording: Takeshi Mori, Sachio Ishii, Eiko Kamiyama Visual Effects: Ryuzo Iwato Assistant Directors: Isao Takahata, Kimio Yabuki "Lullaby of a Motherless Child" Composed by Akira Ifukube Lyrics: Takashi Morishima Vocals: Setsuko Watanabe Choreography: Eimi Hatano Cast: Tomohito Sumida, Yukiko Okada, Chiharu Kuri, Masato Yamanouchi, Kiyoshi Kawakubo, Hideo Kinoshita, Kinshiro Iwao Directed by Yugo Serikawa That's strange... Fine! Do your worst. Oh! Susano! Taro! Stop picking on him! Hey, what are you doing? All right, you! Had enough? Susano! Oh! Mother! Wait. You must not act violently. Taro is sorry, so you must forgive him. But... Son, a boy needs more than a strong body. A boy must also have a gentle heart. Now, let Mother wash you. Then we'll go home. Go, Daddy! Get him! Why you... Okay! Who's next? Me! I'm next! Okay, okay! Don't worry, I won't hurt you! Oh, you're too big for me. Don't be shy. Just one round. I-I was just going home... Hey, Taro! I'll have a go! Oh! No, no thank you. No thanks. Come on! Step right up! Don't be shy! That's right! Izanami has gone away Izanami is gone What do these voices mean? I dunno. Maybe Taro knows. Taro? I don't know. Something has happened to Mother! Mother! Susano! Be still, son. Father! What has happened to Mother? Your mother... She is gone. She's gone? What do you mean? She's gone to a faraway place. She did not want to leave us. But there comes a time when we are called away to a beautiful place. Nothing can be done about it. The time came for your mother, and she had to leave. Had to leave? Then she didn't want to go! I'll go and bring her back! You cannot do that, Susano! Why not? Why not? Because it cannot be done! It's very hard to explain. No! I'm going to find her! I'm going to find Mother! You can't! As your father I forbid you to go! Stop it! Stop crying! What are you doing?! What's that? Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Oh! Mother! You're a big boy now. You mustn't cry like that, Susano. But, you went away, Mother! I am sorry. But I cannot take you with me. Why did you leave me? That was mean! Listen, Susano. You are strong enough to make it on your own. I will give you this to protect you from danger. Is it a nice place where you went, Mother? Yes, it is. It's peaceful, and quiet, and beautiful. It's a country of happiness. Then I want to go there too. Where is it? Is it across the sea? Yes. Across the sea and very far away. A country of happiness. Tell me how to get there! Please, Mother. My dear. Even if you try, it is a place no one can ever find. Why not? Mother! Mother! He's coming around! What have you been doing, Susano? I wanted to go where Mother is. But I couldn't swim there. Of course not! Don't try such a silly thing again. I won't! Let me have a boat instead! A boat? Yes, yes... A boat? What do you want that for? So I can find Mother! Eh? Forget it! What are you doing, Susano? I'm building a boat. A boat? Yes. I can sail across the sea with it. Wow! Will you take me with you? Take me too! I wanna go too! Me too! Sure! I'll take you. A boat trip! Wonderful! Across the sea! Where are we going? To find my mother. We'll go and stay with her. To find your mother? Yeah. First, we'll go to the Land of Night to see my brother, the Moon God. And then, to the High Celestial Plain to see my sister, the Sun Goddess. We'll ask them how to get to my mother's country, and we'll keep going until we find her. Oh, I don't think I can go. Me neither. Me too, I just remembered, I'm going to GO-OH-OHH!! Akahana! You're going, then? If I said I'm going, I'm going! So I'm going! Beautiful moon, please, light our way and guide us safely on our journey. Goodbye everyone! Akahana! Take care of yourself! Akahana! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Goodbye! Good... Goodbye! Goodbye! So long! We'll miss you! Goodbye! Farewell... Stubborn boy. Chasing a dream he will never find. Hey, Susano. Where is the Land of Night? Is it very far? They say it's in the East. But I don't really know where. What? How unreliable! Yeah, like that! You got him! Susano, did you get beaten? I'm here! Oh! Hooray! Let's turn the boat over. Well done! Well done! That was a very bad fish, you know. It's been bothering everyone in the sea for a while. Oh, your boat! - Who are you? - Who, me? I'm the King of the Sea, that's who! I'm Susano! Um... Do you know where the Land of Night is? Sure, I know! You wanna go there? Yes! Very well! Since you've brought peace to the sea, I'll show you. Look! The Land of Night is located under the bottom of the bottom of the sea. Hey! Don't sit on my head! This is the Crystal Cave. It is the entrance to the Land of Night. Wow! Look! Huh? What's that? The Land of Night! Hello! Brother! It's me, Susano! Oh no! Oh no! You... you fool! What are you doing? Oh, it's terrible! It's Prince Susano! And why are you such a mess? Oh, yes. I resisted as best as I could, sir. But the enemy has a giant army! A giant army? Fool. Susano is just a child. Go and investigate. Susano has no reason to attack me. Oh no, Moon God! Susano may be a child, but he's fantastically strong! We must be careful. Please let me take the Magic Ice Mirror in case he becomes violent. The Land of Night is such a lonely and mysterious place. Stop right there! Hey! Open the gate! I came to see my brother! Where is your army, Prince Susano? Army? I have no army. It's a trick. A sneak attack! Keep your eyes open! What are you talking about? Why would I bring an army? You can't fool me! I'm the Minister of War! An experienced soldier! You're a blockhead! Oh, Ice Mirror! Capture him! Susano! Susano! Oh, I'm catching a cold. Who are you? How can you be so cruel? Turning your own brother into ice! It was only to stop him from fighting. Don't worry. He will be all right. You! How dare you turn me into ice? Bunch of cowards! Susano! Why have you come here? I'm going to find Mother! Mother? Yes! I'm going to stay with Mother. Do you know how to get there? Where Mother is now? But you don't want to... No... I cannot tell you. Why? Mother said it's a wonderful and peaceful and beautiful country! Well, perhaps that is so. But it is not a place that you can go. Give up this silly idea and return to Father. You mean you don't want me to see Mother again! Don't you care about her? Of course I care! I care, but there is nothing to be done for her. You just don't love her! I don't need your help! Susano! Wait! Wait, I said! Wait. If you find yourselves in danger, use this. You mustn't give that away! It's our sacred Ball of Ice! It's all right. Look after Susano, Akahana. I can't go any further, Susano. Let's go home. What are you saying? Don't give up! I'm so hungry... Wow, that was scary. It's dangerous to be out now. Oh, is that right? Who are you? Don't be frightened. I live in this fire country. My name is Big Tombo. Many years ago, the river became dry. And it never rains any more. It's all because of the Fire God. Fire God? Hey! Fire God! Hey! Fire God! Come out! I wanna talk to you! Who in the world are you? I am Susano, son of Izanami and Izanagi! It was nice of you to make this country warm, but it's too hot! Everyone's in trouble! You must stop! Silence! Who are Izanami and Izanagi? I don't know them! Begone at once, or I will kill you! Make fun of my father and mother, will you? All right, then! Stop! Go back! You asked for it! Oh, I really don't like this! Susano! Get him! Help me! How's that? Give up yet? Susano! Help me! That's right! I have this! Susano! That's my brother's! Your brother gave this to me. You can use it against the Fire God! Take this! Thank you very very much! It was nothing! Thanks to you, we are free from the Fire God's wrath. Aw, it was easy. Well, let's go. We have to get to the High Celestial Plain. Prince Susano, I have a favor to ask. Would you take me with you? Why? As you can see, this land is barren and miserable. I want to go with you so I can find a better place for my people. All right. Hey! Big Tombo! I'm second-in-command of this expedition! That means I have seniority over you! Got it? Okay. I understand. Prince Susano! For your forgiveness, I give you this magic bird-ship! It will carry you anywhere! It's the High Celestial Plain! Wow! It's beautiful! Prince Susano! Your sister's country is nice and peaceful, isn't it? Who are you? Why have you come to the High Celestial Plain? Oh! My sister! Susano! Is that you? Sister, do you know how to find the beautiful country where Mother is? I do not. But why don't you stay here? I would be so happy. But... I have to find Mother. I see. You know, Susano, we have plenty of land here. I would be pleased if you stayed to make a place for the people of the Fire Country. I'm tired. Why am I doing this for Tombo and his Fire Country people? Watch it! I know! Let's get that horse to help us! Is that okay? We should ask first. What did you say? I'm doing all this work for you! Now give us a hand! Come here... Come on! Don't make me mad! Move! Right! Help! Somebody save me! Forgive Susano this one time. I am sure he did not intend to do anything bad. Let's use this water for our land, too! Is it all right to do that? Don't worry, they can't use it all! This'll do the trick! He let all the water out? I see... I will have to be rather strict with him this time. Still, he knows nothing about farm work. I am sure he did not do it on purpose. We can't use the water from the fields. So let's use this water! Whee! It's finished! Oh no! I don't even know what to say to you! But I didn't mean to! It was an accident! What do you mean it was an accident? Destroying all our crops! He took advantage of us! A very naughty boy! He's trying to take over our country and ruin it! Don't be stupid! - See that? - Now he's getting violent! - Unforgivable! - Catch him! Hey! You can't treat Susano like that, you mean old man! Stop it! Stop it, all of you! Get him! We'll teach you to respect the Sun Goddess! Oh! Sister! Sister! Sister! This is terrible! The whole world will become dark! If this continues, the whole world will soon be full of dark, evil spirits. We must do something! If only we could come up with a way to trick her into coming out. That's it! I have a very good idea! Now! Begin! Good. Now remember... If she opens the stone door just a little... ...You grab it and pull it open! Now! Come on! Wake up! The door is opening! Get ready! Hurry! Longbeard! Why are you celebrating? It must be very dark outside. The truth is, we have a new queen to take your place. This is her! Now! Hold it! Use all your might! That's my beard! Let go, stupid! Ow! Ow! We did it! Susano, it is the council's decision that you must leave the High Celestial Plain. Yes. I understand. Susano, I know that you did not intend to do bad things. But the results of your actions caused everyone much trouble. Yes, I understand. You were careless. But you are a good boy at heart. Yeah, that's right! Don't touch me! Don't give up until you reach your goal. There will be many dangers ahead of you. Dangers? Yes. But be brave. Fight strongly against evil. Help those who are suffering. Remember this, and you will someday find the peaceful happy country where Mother is. Yes. I'll try, Sister. Now I must bid you farewell. Susano, good luck. Goodbye! Oh! A little mouse! He'll drown! Oh? Huh? Thank you for saving my friend. She looks like Mother. But... What are you doing in this lonely place? Huh? Oh, uh, I'm looking for my mother's country. - Your mother's country? - Yes. What country is this? This is Izumo. Do you leave near here? Yes, just along this river. What's wrong? Oh, what shall I do? Yamato-no-Orochi? Yes. A big dragon with eight heads. Every year, when the river turns red, the dragon comes to take away another young girl. Every year? Yes. Seven of our daughters have already been taken away. And he will soon come for Kushinada-hime, our last daughter. All right. I will fight the eight-headed dragon. It's just a snake. Nothing to worry about! The eight-headed dragon will be here in three days. Big Tombo, do you have any ideas? Well... We have eight heads to fight, and... I have a good idea! I'm grateful to you for saving my son from the river. Prince Susano, about this eight-headed dragon... - You said you had an idea? - Yeah. You see, the dragon's heads are like snakes, and are way up high. So you must fly up high to attack them, or you don't have a chance. Fly up and fight? Yes. You must capture Ame-no-Hayaku-Uma! Five miles East of here, there is a lake where you can find a magical flying horse. It is Ame-no-Hayaku-Uma, and it goes to that lake to drink every night. I don't see anything... Stupid! If you don't hide, we'll never catch it! Shh! Be quiet! Now! Hey, we got him! Wait! Wait a minute! Help! I'm afraid of heights! I am Susano. Please help me. Prince Susano, tonight... The eight-headed dragon comes. Aren't you scared? Sure I am! But I'll kill the dragon. It's uncanny... What? You look just like my mother. Oh! Prince Susano, do you love your mother? Very much! That's good. That's how I know I'll absolutely beat that dragon! I didn't know that eight-headed dragons like sake. If the dragon gets drunk, he'll be easier to fight. Man, I'm tired! It weighs a ton. All this for a dragon... What a dumb idea... What'cha makin', Big Tombo? Wait and see! Gotta get ready for the big fight. My ears are too long! Maybe a little lower... Be still, Tombo! You're not scared, are you? J-just a little... Sissy! Coward! Scaredy-cat! It's started drinking the sake... It's looking this way! Take this! A little faster. Here we go. Charge! One down! Here! Catch! Got him! Two! Don't give up! I'm with you! Hurry up! You're so slow! I'll help you. You're helpless without me! Hurry up and fire! Let it go, dope! How'd I get up here? Three down! What the hell? Four heads! - Five down! - Five down! What're you doing? Another one! And seven! Keep it up! Just one left! Prince Susano! Prince Susano! Susano! Where the heck he is? Prince Susano! Prince Susano! Prince Susano! Is he dead? We did it! Look! He's leaving. Prince Susano! What is it, Papa Mouse? Well, you see... Ame-no-Hayaku-Uma was actually a horse from the High Celestial Plain. The High Celestial Plain? Yes. Sent here for you by the Sun Goddess. She made me promise not to tell you until after you killed the dragon. Is that right? I see... Thank you, Sister. Fight strongly against evil. Help those who are suffering. Remember this, and you will someday find the peaceful happy country where Mother is. Susano! Over there! Over there! Oh! Mother! Susano, my son, I have always been with you. - You have? - Yes. I have been with you in your heart. And your country, Mother? It's peaceful and quiet and very beautiful. A country of happiness and love. I know! This is your country! That's right. Work together with your friends, and make this a wonderful country. Mother! Live happily, my dear son. Yes! I will, Mother. Listen, everybody. I'm not going away any more. I will stay here, and make this a wonderful country. I will help you. - Me too! - And me too! You don't have to. No, I'll help. Yes! And all the people of the Fire Country can help, too! Oh! Look!
