Santo The Silver Mask Vs The Martian Invasion With the advance of science come new mysteries Is our planet the only one inhabited by rational beings like us? If so, will we conquer those other worlds? Or, on the contrary, will their inhabitants come to rule us? From now on we will speak in Spanish, For it is the language used in the country we are traveling to The country the Earthlings call Mexico. We are approaching their planet. The time has come to transmit our message to the Earthlings. I need to hear your voice, no matter what you say... ...teJJ me in a verse, my Jove, good night... What's happening? Don' t be frightened, it's a new program. What you are watching on your screen is not a fantasy. It is real. How interesting! We are not just actors performing in a scary movie. Yeah, right! This is our actual appearance. We are from the planet you call Mars. We have lost all control of the transmission! Using scientific advancements surpassing yours by more than five Earth centuries, we have intercepted transmissions from all across your planet. The radar you are so proud of was powerless in detecting our arrival. Instead of using your scientific advancements to better humanity, you Earthlings use them for your own destruction. When you wage war with your conventional weapons you are the only victims of your ambition and selfishness. But with the discovery of nuclear energy, and your mad experiments with the atomic bomb, you are on the verge of destroying the entire planetary system. Before this happens, we warn you that we are prepared to disintegrate all the inhabitants of Earth. Knowing the skeptical attitudes of the Earthlings, we understand that you may doubt the message and not take our warning seriously. Beginning now, we will be forced to use the country called Mexico to show our determination and power. We have weapons one hundred times more powerful than yours. Here are our demands. All governments on Earth shall accept total disarmament, eliminate all borders, and unify your language, and establish a global government that does not discriminate by race or creed, foster Earthly brotherhood, and give up war forever If not, it will be necessary for us to annihilate you Our electronic interstellar brain indicates the Earthlings do not take our warning seriously. They are convinced that our appearance on their screen was just a comedy skit. We will land in a wooded region When we do, you will leave the spaceship and find a public place. Let the Earthlings see you, then disintegrate them with your Astral Eye. This is the only way they will take our orders seriously. The atmosphere on Earth can be deadly but these capsules will help us avoid suffocation And the Martians, who claim to come from a world much more civilized than ours and whose scientific advancements surpass the Earth's by more than 5OO years nonetheless commit the same fatal error of which they accuse us attempting to impose peace and brotherhood through fear and force, forgetting that violence only promotes destruction and hate. Now boys, everyone grab a partner and wrestle with each other, without hurting anyone Let's see how it goes. Luis! 61 00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,534 how many times have I told you, not to cause deliberate harm? Your skill should only be used to counter aggression, or... Or to defend the weak and defenseless, isn' t that right, Santo? Exactly! You have learned the lesson well, Luisito. Come on, go back to wrestling like good sports. Get the children out of here immediately! 67 00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,200 Yes, let's go! Mission accomplished. Terror has gripped the Earthlings. However the one who dresses strangely and covers his face with a silver mask was about to delay our plans. I could not disintegrate him It would have been a mistake to disintegrate him he is a man of extraordinary strength and skill he is the kind of terrestrial specimen that we must take back to our planet I will personally be in charge of capturing the Masked One and bringing him back to the ship. Extral Extral Mysterious disappearance at the sporting field... ...Extra! Extra! Thousands of people disappear... ...Extra! Extra! Catastrophe on the sporting field... Extra! All of the papers read exactly as you have told me, Santo. What could that supernatural being have been, what cruel monster would vaporize even innocent children? I have several theories, but they all sound pretty wild. Can we rule out the possibility that this is some war-mongering power trying to dominate us? I don' t believe that's the situation. With the description you gave me of that incredible being I am sure that it comes from another planet. I have come to the same conclusion, Professor. Did you lock all of the doors? Yes, dear, there's nothing to worry about. It's himl The monster that was at the sporting field. Listen, Earthlings, you doubted the reality of our existence. If it weren' t for Santo the Silver Mask we would have all have been disintegrated. We have shown you proof of our power. You must understand that no scientific or military power on Earth can defeat us We can destroy all of the Earth's inhabitants just we easily as we vaporized the people on the sporting field. Something makes me think that the lost continent of Atlantis was inhabited by a race that also had the Astral Eye. Professor, are you saying that other planets may be inhabited by such creatures? Professor Ordorica here. Who is calling? Santo! The University called. The Martians are transmitting another message on TV. We chose Mexico because it is a country dedicated to pacifism, committed to disarming its territory. We hope that its voice will be heard by other nations. From this moment on we will begin to implement our plan. Resistance is futile. This is the last warning we will give to the Earthlings. We now return control of your television set to you... Ladies and Gentlemen, as incredible as it seems, what you have just seen and heard is terribly real. You are naive, and you do not understand the significance of my words. You, Silver Mask, you witnessed what happened at the sporting field. You are murderers! An intellect as powerful as yours, Professor Ordorica, and a man with strength and integrity like you, Silver Mask, will be the seed of a new humanity, more scientifically and morally advanced. You speak of morals, yet you came to our planet to kill defenseless people and innocent children. It was necessary to do so, because only by force will Earthlings learn to live in peace. The means you are using to pacify us make you no better than criminals! The crime would have been to let you unleash a nuclear war that would not only destroy you, but also destroy other planets like ours where life exists. You are not the masters of the universe! Caution, Silver Mask. I do not want to harm you. You two will come with me to our spaceship. All you need to do is take my hand. Surrender, Silver Mask, or I will break your arm. I have momentarily paralyzed him, Professor. You only have to touch my hand the dial on my belt will transport us to the space: Let's go, Professor. Do not resist me. How strange... it was obvious that he was suffocating, but when he took one of these capsules, he recovered immediately. I will examine them carefully. Mother! Father! What's going on? Son! Do not be afraid, we will not harm you. Our Martian appearance frightens the Earthlings and delays our plans. Why do we frighten them, when our bodies are more perfectly evolved than their own? It is all in the mind... We must change our appearance. We will use the transformation chamber. We have altered our Martian appearance, and from now on we will communicate using names taken from the Earthlings' mythology. As captain of the ship, I will be known to you as Argos. You are a scholar excelling in studies of time and space and you will be named Kronos. With your hypnotic powers, you will be called Morpheo. You are a Martian with unusual physical strength, so you will be called hercules. Hercules is the only one among us whose strength will match the Silver Mask. And you shall be called Aphrodite, for you will use your beauty to win over those whose services we need. You who has the serene beauty of the moon shall be Selena. You shall be Artemisa, and you shall be Diana. Do not forget, now that we have taken these undesirable human forms to achieve our plan, that our Astral Eye will no longer work to vaporize or paralyze the Earthlings. We will depend exclusively on our belts to protect us and to defeat the Earthlings. Will they work to make us invisible? No, they will not. When we enter into battle we must act quickly. Our human appearance will be brief, and to gain our old bodies back we must again enter the transformation chamber. If the Silver Mask uses his strength to resist us, should we destroy him? With the plan I have in mind, his strength will be useless and we can capture him alive. He and Professor Ordorica are magnificent specimens, and we must take them back to our planet at any cost. What do the capsules contain, Professor? They contain chemical substances that oxygenate their lungs. Apparently our atmosphere asphyxiates them. In other words, without those capsules they would die? Uh-huh. Look Santo, this species uses the Astral Eye to hypnotize their enemies... or disintegrate them. But how can we stop them? How can I get to their spaceship when our instruments cannot detect its presence? How can we prevent them from following through with their threat? There are only two possibilities. One of them is nearly impossible. The other is this apparatus I invented. It detects brain waves, and I can adjust it to the mental vibrations of the Martians. Because of their extraordinary intelligence, they emit ultra high frequency vibrations in moments of great emotion or tension. This device will identify these vibrations. For example, when they set out to do harm, their vibrations will increase in intensity. This apparatus can indicate where the vibrations come from? Exactly. When will this be ready to use, Professor? You can have it tomorrow. And what about the other possibility - - of locating their spaceship and getting to it? We' d have to seize one of the Martian's belts. I have observed that they are able to travel wherever they want to go simply by turning the dial on their belt. I will see you tomorrow, Professor. I am off to train, for now more than ever I must be prepared for any attack. Let's go, Professor. There is no use trying to resist us. Be reasonable. You must have physical contact with us in order to be transported to our spaceship. Professor, there is no danger in doing so. Caution Kronos! Fire suppresses the oxygen. Wrestling Club Thanks guys, it has been a very good training session. It's useful for us, since we learn so much from you! Un next time, Santo, and thank you very much. Good night. Okay, take care. Santo! Your end has come. He is going to beat them. We must hypnotize him! No, remember the instructions from Argos. What happened? What happened, Santo? That's what I want to know. I just remember that two beautiful women came up to us... and then, nothing. Oh, how my head hurts. I saw those Martians on TV and I can' t sleep. They say that very serious things are happening but they keep them secret to avoid alarming the public. I told my husband we should leave... Tell me doctor, what is the reason for your urgent call? Yesterday we had a meeting with other men of science and we came to the conclusion that we are being invaded by Martians. However, we all agreed to keep it a secret to avoid panic. But we are at great risk! Would you rather see all activity in the city come to a halt? We would cause anarchy and chaos if we told the public. I see. Then what can we do? We must use every form of communication to reach the public and convince them that the situation is make believe, and not real at all. In that case, we must start by convincing our wives. Who are they? I don' t know them. Your science fiction novel has truly been a success. I understand that you are going to release a sequel? The third - - but I plan to postpone it. But why? Because the make-believe Martian invasion I talk about in my book is no longer a fantasy. It is a frightening reality. Well, as for me, I' m like Saint Thomas, I won' t believe it un I see it. Look! Wow, what luck you have! Careful, he'll blow up the ship! I can' t believe it. We can' t believe what's happening, either. But we can be sure they will take us to Mars. We must do something. There's no use. We can do nothing against them. I' m hungry, and thirsty. This is an outrage. This is concentrated food. It is much more powerful than your vitamins. It will nourish you and quench your thirst. Two pills for each adult and one for each child every 24 hours. You have done an excellent job using your Earthly enchantments. I congratulate you, though I truly don' t know what Earthlings see in such an appearance. We don' t either. This look is repugnant. We need more children, and another group of adults with special qualities. But most of all we need Professor Ordorica and the Silver Mask. Once we have them in our hands we will return to our planet. The Silver Mask shows more resistance each time. He is endangering our lives. What is the purpose of kidnapping him when we can take other Earthlings? The more he resists, the more I understand that Silver Mask is extremely talented. Once we get back to Mars we will kill him so that our scientists can study his brain, his muscles, and his lungs. For what purpose? Santo possesses a strength we lack. We need to scientifically reproduce his physical characteristics in our own space soldiers when the time comes to invade Earth. We must once again to remind the public of the need to remain calm, especially after the Martians return to their own planet. All citizens must resume their normal activities. An intense information campaign was launched using all means of communication to help calm the public. The inhabitants of the city began to enjoy their favorite pastimes again. Ladies and Gentlemenl Two falls of three, no time limit. Mask vs. Mask! In this corner, the mask of Black Eagle! And in this corner, the undefeated Silver Mask! After hercules dominates him, he will transport him back to our spaceship. Why doesn' t Santo rip off his mask, instead of trying to take his belt? I don' t understand it, either. They will accuse you of fraud. You've already lost. He is not a human being, he is a Martian! For a moment I was a victim of your spell, but I know who you are and what you intend to do. Will you come with us? If you don' t we can destroy you. But what happens if, before you do, I am able to rip off your belts? It functions perfectly Santo. All you need to do is tune in like this. It is the mental vibrations of the Martians. They must be planning another attempt. 3O degrees to the north... Roughly 1 O kilometers from here. How can I find the place exactly? The second needle will signal the place where they are. We must explain our purpose to you. As a man of moral and religious conviction, rely you can understand that our intentions are no Many are the errors and sins of humankind, but for you to manipulate our conscience does not seem noble to me. Pretending to our humanity by destroying it is hardly proof of a superior race. We are not here to argue with you. Come with us voluntarily. I know you are in danger, Father. Don' t get near them! This is our best opportunity to capture him. Do not faiI. Not here, this is the house of God. If Santo will not enter this house, then we will all leave. I'll do as you say, but order them to stop fighting. We all have a mission in life. Yours in on our spaceship. Theirs will soon be decided. Save us Father, we are so afraid. Please, for the sake of the children. We can do nothing. The Lord is the only one who can save us. Let us pray. Leave the prayers, Father, this is no time for miracles. Don' t you see what's happening? Our Father, who art in heaven... ...give us this day our daily bread... Pilot, it is time to feed the prisoners. In our effort to capture the Silver Mask we have already extended our stay on Earth. We cannot return to our planet without Professor Ordorica or the Silver Mask. When the pilot comes in with our food we must attack him. Some of you hold him down while the rest go outside to attack the others. If we faiI, we must disable the spaceship. Anything is better than having them take us to Mars. Let's go! Be careful with the control. The spaceship will explode! We cannot fight them. We are most certainly doomed. Since Professor Ordorica attacked you with the fire, you have not made another attempt to capture him. This time you will not faiI. Let's see where he is. Come in. To what do I owe the honor of your visit? Did you forget already, Professor? We came to remind you that tonight is the ceremony we have organized in your honor. I greatly appreciate your efforts, but you must cancel it. Did you forget that we are being invaded by Martians threatening to destroy the human race? That is precisely why we must go on with it, Professor Ordorica. For several weeks we have talked about this ceremony. If we cancel it, people will say it is due to the Martian invasion, and it will cause alarm. I don' t think you are aware of the danger we are in! We are just as aware of this as you are, Professor, but we have decided it must be kept secret. Otherwise the panic will cause as great a disaster as the Martians themselves. Can you imagine what will happen if doctors abandon hospitals, workers leave their jobs, and the cities are left without transportation, food, or communication? Your public presence, and ours, covered by the newspaper, radio and TV will help to calm the public spirit. You have convinced me. We have chosen the Club Tropical and the event is at 1 OPM. Do not forget it, colleague. The moment has come for you to return to action. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of presenting to you the Tropical Ballet. That is not the Tropical Ballet. What's happening? I don' t know, boss. I thought you had hired another group of artists. Let's go to the dressing room. What would you like, boss? Another Martian! Help! To avoid general panic, the many kidnappings that occurred throughout the city were kept secret. It is evident that this is all the work of the Martians as they make good on their threats. This very night, in front of scholars whose testimony is beyond reproach, the famous nuclear physicist Professor Ordorica was kidnapped. Father Fuentes, priest and philanthropist, was also kidnapped. We are recommending that no one venture out of the house after 7PM. Since that moment, Mexico's inhabitants did not dare leave their homes at night. I do not want to go where they are taking us. Let's go home, Mommy. The only one that can save us is Santo, the Silver Mask. We cannot wait any longer. We have oxygen pills only for tonight. It is urgent that we capture the Silver Mask and return to our planet. If we cannot capture him, we shall destroy him. Announce that you'll be fighting tonight? Put it in the paper, on the radio and TV? Santo, you know the people are terrorized and no one will show up at the arena? I know the public will not attend, but the announcement will have its effect. You know that this will cost me a fortune... I will pay. Very well. What do you plan to do? Trap one of the Martians. Santo, I know you are the best wrestler in the world, but after what I saw the other night in the arena, I' m afraid those people, or whatever they are, will be too much for you to handle. I don' t want to offend you, but I won' t be there. The Silver Mask! I don' t know why I accepted, but anyway, let's get out of here. We have to honor our deal. They are paying us better than ever. Even though the truth is I' d rather be home with my wife and kids. Every time you fight the arena is full, and look at it now. Wouldn' t it be better to cancel the fight? Let's cancel the fight, Santo. What's the point? I' m sorry, we' re going to fight as if the arena were full of spectators. Surrender yourself, Silver Mask, you have no hope. I will fight un death. Careful Santo, I will vaporize you if you do not surrender. Hercules! Capture him! Capture him! Let's go! Prepare the controls and take off! We must depart immediately! In a few seconds we'll be asphyxiated. Out of the way! Move to the side! Let's gol Get out quickly. Be careful, Santo. They'll blow up the spaceship! Where are you going? I must go back and make sure the Martian spaceship is destroyed. No, Santo, let our scientists research it and discover the secrets of Mars. Our science will advance 5OO years. That is exactly what I want to avoid. Please Santo! Professor, humanity is not prepared for such progress, and you know it. But you will die in the explosion. Santo! The human race has been saved, for the moment. Will we learn our lesson? Or will we insist on carrying on crazy nuclear experiments un we disappear from the face of the Earth?
