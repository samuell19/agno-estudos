Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm fine. Yeah, that was convincing. I've been thinking about this dream I was having last night, and... Wow, yeah, we're doing this. Like we're in Nashville breaking into the music industry. I mean, can we even do this without Amber? Maybe she's closer than we think. Mm, maybe. Nashville. Nashville. Hey, and we already do have an agent, so. We do. Nashville, we're coming for you! Make yourselves comfortable. Well, I guess, there's no way to sugarcoat this. On second thought, maybe there is, go ahead, help yourself. Now, guys, I really enjoyed your performance back in Colorado, but... I've been offered an amazing opportunity in L.A. So, what does that mean for the rest of us? Bless your heart I'm relocating to Los Angeles. I meant to call, but I've just been so busy, sorry. Okay, so translation, you won't be able to help us. What, are you serious? You're great, it's just... Just save it, just whatever. Cool, so that's just it then. I'm sorry Sam, I really am. It's this industry it never stops. You can keep the cookie jar if you'd like. No, thanks, I'm good. Thanks. I'm sorry y'all had to drive so far. Best of luck to ya! Oh. Mm, a spoonful of sugar I guess, mm. Sam I wasn't planning on going alone. You mean, you'll take me? We're gonna go to Nashville? Really? Tell me that doesn't sound amazing! No, it does sound amazing! Us packing our bags. Here you guys go Y'all doing all right still? Yeah, it's great, thanks. All righty. Do you think we made a mistake in coming here? No, I don't think we made a mistake. I mean, listen, the agent is a setback, but I mean, we had a reason for coming out here. What Amber would have wanted and we should finish what she started. For her and for us. She really would've loved it out here, wouldn't she? Yeah, she practically would've kissed the ground here. Oh, maybe you're right. So, tell me about this dream you had. It was weird because it was so real, and Amber was there, and she's up on stage, and she's singing this song. And I kid you not, it was legitimately really good. It was incredible. It was legit. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, hold on. No way. Is that... Dude! Dude, what? That's the same song from my dream, how did you know? I had the same dream. Are you serious? It's crazy, right? Yeah. That's so weird. Do you have the lyrics? Yeah, no, no, no, of course. I mean, I wrote these down as soon as I could. We have to tell the band! ♪ You know it's true ♪ I'm here with you ♪ Even in my dreams ♪ I'm here with you That was so beautiful. Okay, great, so we have a new song, but we still don't have an agent That's technicality. Mm, technically, we still have no agent. So, what's the point? The point is, guys, we're Epic Chance. We're a band. We're gonna make music, okay? Whether or not we have an agent. See, that's easy for you to say because after that buzz kill of a meeting, I've been stuck with Tweedledee and Tweedledum over here. Hey! Okay, I'm just gonna be real. This song is about a dream. It's about a literal dream. Mm, and Amber was there, okay? And Tristan was there and you were, and you were there! And you were there, and you were there, and you were there. And you were there, and you were there, and you were there... You get a car, you get a car. Sorry, this is starting... This is starting to sound real Wizard of Ozzy. Just forget it, they're not gonna understand. Hey, no, no, no, no, it's not that, it's just we have to be realistic. Dorothy woke up maybe we should too. Well, one way or another, we're going to perform this song You can decide to be there, or not. Sam. Hey. What is this? It's an apology. I'm super sorry for yesterday. I was being pretty lame, a dingus. Maybe- - Oh! It's the agent. Whoa. Hello? Sam, It's Chelsea from the agency. Hi, how are you? It's good to hear from you. Good. Listen, I've got a friend who's a manager in town, she's incredible too, top notch. Been in the industry for years. Really? I mean that's great, that's... Number, number. Do you... Could we get her number? Bless your heart, I can't give that to you. She don't take cold calls. Okay, is there some way we could get a hold of her?

Hi there. Do y'all have an appointment today? Yes, we are Epic Chance for the 3:00 PM slot. Dude thanks again, man. This album is gonna be sick. Oh. Oh, we found the sweet spot. This is gonna be great. Oh, yeah. That sounded amazing. Oh, thanks I'm glad you liked it. I mean, you look so familiar to me. Dude! Dude, it's Nathan Osmond. Yo. It's... I love, love, love your work. Oh, thanks so much. You're Nathan Osmond, the country singer, like the Nathan Osmond. Well, a little bit country, a little bit rock and roll. No? You guys are a little too young for that reference, I guess. Little bit. Well, anyways, I'm a huge fan and my sister was too. Was? Uh-oh, what'd I do? No, it's not like that. It's just she's no longer with us. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. It was nice to meet you. And I'm Sam. I'm a singer as well. - Oh. - And this is my band, Epic Chance. Tristan.

Have fun, dude. You'll love it. Thanks. Awesome. Normally, I don't do this, but you guys seem really cool. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, or anything about this crazy biz, I'd love to help. Thank you. Thank you so much, of course. I should probably get going. Go do what you need to do. Go make a killer track. Thanks. Oh, and Sam, the ones we love never really leave us. Ooh, and that is it. Oh, sick song by the way. Thank you! My sister wrote it. Hey, talent runs in the family. Well, we'll pack up and get out of your hair. No, no, no. Take your time. Thanks. Oh, and welcome to Nashville. Well we are going to the van and don't you guys go making out or anything. - Wow! - Oh, the lovebirds. Stop! Go away. Y'all are crazy. Yeah. They're crazy. That'd be weird. You okay? It just all seems really fresh sometimes. I was in love with your sister and I still am. I don't know. I think the whole grieving process is just a... It's really confusing to me. Yeah. Yeah, I totally get that. Believe me. But you know you've helped me through a lot of it. Do you think she's happy? I mean, she is showing up in our dreams singing so. I think saying she's happy is a pretty safe bet. Yeah. I mean, you know what else is a safe bet? This song. ♪ Cause nothings as it seems ♪ Even in my dreams ♪ I won't let you go ♪ Cause I already know ♪ You know its true ♪ I'm here with you ♪ Even in my dreams ♪ I'm here with you Well. Well? Who wrote it? My sister. Or, well, sort of. Well, let's hope she can sort of write another one. Wait, so are you saying that you're si... Yes, honey, I'm signing you. Yeah, I'm signing all of you. We're signed! All right, yeah, sign the last page. Let's get this ball rolling. Wait wait, wait, hold on. Maybe we should read it first. Yo, this thing is like 30 pages long. You know, this is very, very standard stuff, guys. I just think Well, I'm sure it is, it would be better- - Look, we need all the time we can get. Look, you know I've got like 1,000 much more established artists wanting to work with me right now. So, if you don't wanna do this, if you don't wanna work with me, really, that's fine. I mean, it's probably too big of a risk for me. No, no, no, no, no, we wanna work with you. Okay, well, then you can see I'm a very busy woman, I don't like to waste time. Look, can you at least give us a Readers Digest version of this contract? Oh, sure, sure, it's very simple. Okay, I represent you as a band for a period of five years. I open all the doors, concerts, PR, radio play, everything. You guys, you guys just have to bring your A game. I charge standard 15%, very standard. Well, I think that sounds fair Cause it is, doll. All the other managers in this t charge 20%, and none of them work as hard as I do. I have your backs. Trust me. Do you have a pen? Okay. - Yes! - To getting signed. Okay. To getting signed! Okay, wait, wait, to Amber. - To Amber. - To Amber. - To Amber. - Yeah! - To Amber. - To Amber! Yeah, Amber! Hey, you're missing out on the party going on. Did you guys actually read this? Mm, yeah, no. Technically no, but it's fine, cause we went through all the terms and talked about the details, and everything. Okay, well did they go over the 15% collection of royalties? Yes. 15%? Mm-hmm. From each of you. Yeah. What? I mean, she just said that it was like 15%. Okay, well did she clarify? So, did she clarify of what total gross, net of each song, each concert, and each album, and who owns what? No, I mean, she didn't really go over the details. No, but I don't know, I think that's fine. It's fine, it's gonna be okay, because I dunno, she's highly recommended, and I don't know. I'm sure all of this is just standard, so. Do me a favor, make a copy of this, I'll send it over to my dad. He knows the industry just in case. Okay. Okay, I'll do that. Thanks. Shoot. Amber? Is that you? Of course it's me, silly! You expecting anyone else? I miss you so much. You have no idea. So, tell me everything. How's Nashville? It's different. It's a whole new world. Yeah? Yeah. Well, what do you think, worth it? I feel like it's too early to tell, but I have a good feeling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Even In Dreams. It worked. What worked? Hey, so I took the liberty of making a copy and sent it over to my dad. - Thank you. Thanks. - Mm-hmm. I'll let you know what he says. Hopefully I was just thinking too much into it. Okay, hey what do you think of this? Dr. Shawls. Sam, wow, what a surprise. What are you doing here? I have a client. He just moved here. Uh-huh, in this building? I opened a temporary office. Yeah, my mom put you up to this, didn't she? Mm? Yeah. Neither confirm or deny. She totally did! Ugh! I mean, you guys know you were like, you're divorced, right? Like you're not... You're not my stepdad anymore. Sorry, we just care about you. It's really sweet. It's really sweet that you guys went through all this trouble, It was good to see you, Sam. Take care of yourself. All right. You too. I'm just gonna... I'll see ya. Yeah, okay, bye. Yup, you too... I'm so... Sorry about that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I saw you at the concert the other night. There were the like the depressed lobster band. Yeah! Yeah, sorry. You did, or I'm Sam, by the way. Adam by the way. Oh. You're gonna go see Debra? Yes, I'm gonna, that's why... That's why I'm here. Cool, she's just the first door on the right. Okay, cool. She's kind of a spitfire, but- - Yeah. - Cool. Good to see you again. Okay, good to see you again too. Don't be late. Okay, I won't. I'm going, I'm rushing, okay, bye. Bye. Oh. Hi, you wanted to see me? Yes, yes, hang on one second, I'm just gonna... Oh, aren't those great? I'm always amazed at how photogenic I am. All right, then let's go. - Go, where? - See my friend, Giovanni Coloroni! I'm sorry, I don't... I don't know who that is. You're worse off than I thought. Come on, go, go. Get out, go. The fashion industry, again? What? Girl, image is everything. He changed the entire fashion industry and after his 99 line, the New York scene started to notice, fashion mags, runways, you get me? Yeah. Debra, darling! - Gio, my love - Uh! I present you with... A project. Ugh, yes, I see. Debra, you said a project Oh, we must bring her to the chair immediately! - Yes. - What are we doing? We're doing what? The chair? - Ooh! - No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't know, I like her- - I just washed my hair. Please be careful please. Do you see how I feel like this is good. I feel like we've got a good amount. You need so much more work. Oh! I have created the Mona Lisa! Debra! Oh! Oh! Bravo! Bravo, Gio. And next wardrobe. Margaret! We need options! I'm coming, I'm coming. Woo, right here. Ugh. No, no! - No? - No! No? Last season. Margaret! This is wrong, all wrong! I know. I know, I'm sorry. And I, and I- - What have I told you about the line when it becomes two months old? I am so sorry, Gio, I will fix it. Fix it! Immediately. Well, that's what you get for hiring your cousin. Here, try this. And this. Oh, yes, I can sell this, I can sell this. Definitely sends a message. I'm sorry, none of these outfits are me. Come on, sit down, sit, sit, sit. You saw all of those awards on my desk. Do you know how I got all that recognition from my clients? I molded them, Sam. I molded them, like pieces of clay. People come to me wanting to get into the music industry. Have you seen the top 40? Have you seen what they look like? Appearance is everything. Talent is only secondary. So, you're saying you want me to change my appearance. I am saying you can be a star, you will be a star. You just need to change... Everything that I am. I don't write the rules, kid. Okay, well, what about the rest of the band? Why has this... You're the face of the band, they're just in the background, nobody cares about them. Look, I'm sorry. I'm just being really honest with you, but if you wanna help your band succeed, you could heed my advice. Which is? Let me mold you, Sam. Play the part, be the pop star. Sam, you have all the tools. You just need to read the manual I see you carry this with you, but you have this all the time. What is this? Oh, it's just it's my... My sister's notebook. Your sister's? Yeah. Why do you have it? Oh, no, of course, you don't. You don't know. My sister passed away recently. I'm sorry. May I see it? Is this her? Yeah. Mm, very beautiful. Always smiling. That's Amber. So, she wrote these songs and you're here to finish them. That's the plan. Means a lot to you, doesn't it? It means everything. Then trust me, Sam. I know how to make your dreams, Amber's dreams, into a beautiful reality. Do it for your sister. Make her proud. Okay. I wanna do something for you. Can I take you shopping? Oh, not for more clothes is it? No, no, no, no, for anything you want. Sure, yes, can I get out of this first? Yeah. Okay, ugh. Monique? Hey, sorry to wake you. Do you know where Sam is? She's not answering her phone. She didn't tell you? Tell me what? This place is legit. This place is definitely something. I haven't seen this since 2003. That's vintage, it's cool. Vintage? 2003 is now vintage. - Yeah. - Oh, great. See anything you like? Oh, well, I was gonna ask, how much are the records? It depends on the record. Some of our signed collectables can go as high as $700. I'm clearly in the wrong business. Hey, fancy seeing you here. Oh! Oh. Hey. Hi! Yeah. What are you doing here? I'm just checking out some guitars, even though I already have 12, it's... - Oh. - It's like a bad habit, I always want more. Yeah, that's... That is pretty bad. Oh! - Whoa! - What was that? Oh, now, the T-shirts over there- - Now, that was so bad. That was really, I'm sorry. You know what else is bad? What? Me. No, I just... I'm not really good at this. Not good at flirting? No. No, I just mean, like when I'm talking to new people. Well, you kind of got this foreigners charm. I would say that. Oh, no, it's just, it's been quite the day with Debra. Yeah, believe me, I get it. Yeah. I don't know. It's just been really overwhelming. Well, how about we just, I don't know, just wanna get out of here? I mean, let's ditch her. I'm sorry, like Debra? You wanna like right now? You got anything else planned today? Not really, no. All righty then, let's go. Okay. Yeah. Come on. Okay. I think she'll take care of that soon, so. See ya, Debra. No! I'm trying! What? Nothing. You said you were good at this. Ooh! Didn't even try. They can come and get it. Yeah. Oh, why does he keep doing that? That one's cute. Sorry, just... That's all right. Hey, you hungry? It's a simple question. I could eat. - Okay. - Yeah. Yeah, cause I'm starving. Yeah, cool, me too. Mm, you thirsty? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, oh, there you go. You said you were... Ugh! I picked brunette and blonde - - Oh! - Oh, here it is. Ooh. Well, let me know if you need anything else. - Okay. - Okay, thank you. Enjoy, y'all. Bon appetite! You speak French? Nah, not really, I'm just trying to impress you. You could always serenade me. Why would that work? A little bit? So, you never told me your story. Well, I was born in a small town in Colorado. My family, well, my sister, Amber, she passed away not too long ago, yeah. Things haven't really been in the same since. I'm really sorry, Sam. Sorry I asked. No, no! It's fine. I love talking about her. Really, I do, it's... She was a huge part of my life, and she still is. You really looked up to her didn't you? I wouldn't be doing all of this if it weren't for her. I mean, I wouldn't even be here for that matter. I wanna show you this. That's her notebook, it's got her lyrics, songs, everything. This is her? Yeah, that's Amber. Um... What? I've seen her. Where? Just here in Nashville, just a few weeks ago. That's not really possible. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I swear, I saw a girl that looked just like her, just the other day. I mean, I wish that were true, but she passed away, and she never really made it to Nashville. I'm sorry, must have been her doppelganger. Was she wearing yellow? I'm sorry? The girl you saw, Amber's doppelganger, was she wearing yellow by chance? I can't remember, why? Just wondering. I'm still gonna get you back for that stunt you pulled at the pond. No. This is my humble abode for the meantime. I had a lot of fun. I did too. I'll move that for you. It happens a lot. Gotta little bit of hair right. Thanks. Who's that? What? It looks like Sam's got herself a boy toy. Oh! Sorry. Yep, I'm gonna... It's okay. Guys, I just saw some guy smackin on Sam. Oh, snap. Dude, looks like Sam found herself a boyfriend. No, she doesn't. Yup, look for yourself. Well... Goodnight, Sam. Goodnight, I'll see ya. Oh! You all right? I'm good. No. Tie your shoes next time, huh? I will, noted. Are you locked out? No, no. You're locked out. No. I'm good. Oh, Tristan, hey. Goodnight, Sam. Goodnight. You really didn't have to wait up for me. Yeah, we didn't, We were just working on... Whoa, what were we working on? Oh, we were working on an album that our manager is having us put together. And you were? It was one night. Come on, you were gone like, all day. I was gone all day, I was working with our manager. I was working on this stuff. Band stuff, don't you think you need your band mates for that? Huh, but instead, you're going out on a date. Thanks for thinking of us. No, it's not like... It's not like that. Well, what is it? I wasn't even... No, okay. What is it? Whatever, fine. Never mind. Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind. Hello? Hey, I didn't wake you, did I? No, I've been awake for a few hours. Okay, good. So, I have this new song that I've been working on, and I really wanna show it to you. I was wondering... ♪ Like avocado toast ♪ Just like you the most ♪ The way you fill me up Hey, beautiful. No one's ever called me that b You're kidding. Wow. So, the song. Yeah. Yeah, are you gonna show it to me, or... Okay, I just have the chorus down, but I want you to be brutally honest. Oh, yeah, I'll be brutal. Okay, great. Okay. Here we go. ♪ Like avocado toast ♪ I just like you the most ♪ The way you ♪ fill me up just right ♪ Perfect day or night ♪ I just like you the most And voila, that's all I got. Are you serenading me? Okay, all right, no, I- - Is that what you're doing? Wow. You're serenading me right now? You wish. - Wow. - I'm just kidding, no. I know that's what it looks like, but come here. I promise, this was for feedback purposes. Feedback, okay, so research. Strictly research. Yeah, what are your thoughts? Well, if you wanna know honestly, I loved it. Really? It was really good, yeah, and I'm serious! Cool. I mean, I don't really know how you manage to make a song about toast so beautiful. I was inspired. I guess. Ooh! Steamy. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your- - No, no, we're good, cause we were just... I was just showing her a new song that I wrote. Yeah. What's up? Well, it so happens I hooked both of you up with a photo session for this afternoon. A photo shoot, for what? For what? Sam, have you learned nothing? Photos for the album covers, glam photos for the press. Oh. I mean, how glam are we talking? Don't worry, Giovanni will take care of you again. Ooh, more outfits, yay! I swear, this is like the third time we've gone out for new equipment Yeah, how are we affording this? Look, it's not new so it's cheaper. Mm, so it's used. It's previously owned. I'm sorry, did you just want me to stand... Ooh, I'm sorry! Sam! Okay, I mean- - Okay, you got this. I'm sorry. Ugh, okay. Do you just want me... - No, no- - Like here? Is that fine? Like before. I feel like I'm really close to you if you do that. Oh, okay, hey, boyfriend. Come here. Right here, right here. I didn't say you were a boyfriend, I'm sorry. No, no, look in his eyes. His? Okay. Okay. Hi. Yeah, see. Uh, I like that one. All right, all right. Perfect. Yeah, see, I knew you had it. Hold on. We're on the radio! Crank it! Crank it! Yeah! Woo! Yes! Yes! This is amazing, man.

Yeah, just not the same. I just got off the phone with my contact at 98.9 FM, your song was on the radio just now. Are you serious? Yes, and I booked you a television appearance. Your segment airs tomorrow night live. Oh, my gosh! Are you serious? I knew you could do it. This is gonna be huge exposure for you, really. I told you I was brilliant didn't I? You did, and thank you. Woo! Thank you, thank you! Uh, and we're hugging now. Oh, okay. I'm sorry, sorry. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. But I'm gonna bring in the rest of the band, right? No, no, remember what we talked about. You're the focus here. Can I bring Tristan? Who? Tristan. Mm? I mean, like lead guitarist, Tristan, he sings..Tristan... Green. Oh! Oh, I... Sure, sure, couldn't hurt. And you Mr, it's time for your photo session. I gotta use the bathroom. I'm sorry, sorry, I'm sorry. You look great. Do I smile for these, or... I don't know. Straight face, I dunno. It's Sam! Hey Sam! Hola, Sam. Hi, mom, how are you? How's Nashville? Wait, Sam, explain yourself first. I got a text from Tristan about some guy that you're seeing. No, no, it's not like... Mom, no, it's just he's a boy, it's not like that, it's weird. Who is this boy? It's fine, it's not... We're friends. Oh, so it's true. - Mm. - He's just a singer. He's fine, anyways, I really don't have a ton of time, but I wanted to call because I wanted to tell you some exciting news. You know what they say about singers. What? I don't know, I was asking you Hello? Hello? Mom? Yes, si. We're here. Yes. Well, I wanted to call you cause I wanted to tell you that I have some really exciting news. I'm gonna be on a TV show. Crazy, I think it's on channel 16, channel 16. - Wow, okay. - Mm. Got it. Adios Samantha, break a leg on the show. So many legs, like all of the legs. Bye, I have to go, I have to go, bye. Oh, my. It's gonna be worth missing my Wrestlemania. And my favorite telenovela. What did you wanna show me? Remember this? It's the pick from our first show. Exactly. Where did you... Let's just say, I have my sources. Amber, I love it. I love you. ♪ She was my sun ♪ My stars my moon ♪ It breaks my heart ♪ she was taken ♪ Much too soon ♪ Feels like coming undone ♪ Like coming undone ♪ I'm broken and numb ♪ I'm broken and numb ♪ She's the only one who ♪ got me through the day ♪ Now she's gone away ♪ No one understands ♪ like you do ♪ But these days ♪ it's just not you ♪ Feels like talking ♪ to a stranger ♪ Talking to a stranger ♪ Where have you gone ♪ Now she's gone ♪ it's just not the same ♪ These days it's just not you ♪ It's just not you ♪ It's just not you ♪ It's just not you Hey. You okay? Yeah, I'm just working on a new song. So, my dad did look over the contract, he said most of it was pretty standard. He did mention that there seemed to be a lot of gray areas. So, just be careful. Yeah, okay. Thanks. Sam! We were on the radio today. Yeah, no, I heard, that was good. Tristan wants to talk to you. He's outside waiting. You wanted to talk to me? Did I do something? Where you been, Sam? What do you mean where have I been? I've been working. Did you forget that we were supposed to get new band equipment today? By the way, we heard our song on the radio. I heard it too! It was great. That's just it. We all heard it together, and you weren't there. I'm sorry it's been really rough for you. It's been rough. Wow, look where we are. We have, oh, I don't know, a killer manager, you're welcome We have our song on the radio, we have our song, Amber's song on the radio. And you think that you did all this? Because the last time I checked, the band was here. I mean, we were working on our album while you were off with some guy I'm sorry, are you... Am I what? Are you jealous? - What? - I thought we talked about this, this is what we- - That is not the point. We sat down and talked. No! Really? That's not the point? What's it about, It's about you not caring about the band anymore. No. Are you kidding? Do you see me right now? Yeah, exactly. I look ridiculous. I'm wearing this, I'm... Come on! That's exactly it. Yeah, no, I know. It's not me because guess what? The real me's not gonna sell. Who told you that? Who told me? Who do you think told me that? Come on. I've been out all day. I've been making this album cover for us, for the band, for you, for Amber for everyone else. For me? It's not for me, Sam. Yeah. And you know what? It's not for Amber. Don't say that about her. Look, Sam- - I've been trying to make this successful, I've been trying to make our band make it. I'm trying to make money, I'm trying to do everything. Money, okay. Are you really gonna- - Did you forget why we came out here? We came out here to make music. You know what? I've known you a long time, Sam, and I feel like I don't know you anymore. I felt like if Amber was here... Don't say that. She'd be saying the same thing to you. This Sam, whoever she is, she'd break Amber's heart. How dare you? Wow. Debra booked me to interview on a TV show. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. She wanted just me to go. But I asked her if I could bring you, but you know what? Be there, don't be there, I don't really care. Doesn't really make a difference Amber? Amber, where am I? Amber? Amber, where am I? There you are. What's wrong, Sam? Amber, I don't... I don't know what to do anymore. About what? Everything. Well, what do you want? That's just it. Amber, I don't know anymore. Yes, you do. I thought I could do it, I can't. I can't, Amber, I'm letting the band down, and it's like I have to be somebody else to make it. Here's what I've learnt, Sam. If you think you can't do something, sure enough, you won't be able to, but if you think you can, then you can! And you will. But how? I mean, how do I do that when every time I try, like you say, I fail and I fall, and I do it over, and over, and over again. I'm sick of it. Sam, you might fall down a time or two, or three, but the point is, you get back up, and you keep on trying. You never really fail, unless you fail to try. I wish you were really here. I am. Where? I'm wherever you want me to be, Sam. Amber, I don't... What do you mean by that? Amber, what does that mean? I've been... Amber? Something's happening to me. I don't know what's going on. What's going on? I'm sorry Sam, I don't think I can stay for very long just don't forget to... Amber, don't forget to what? What? Amber, Amber? Amber, oh don't go away. Where'd you go? Oh. Is Tristan coming? - Who? - Thank you. Oh, Tristan. No, no, he's not here yet, but there is someone here to see you. Hi. Hey, Sam. Hey. Oh, you two make such a cute couple. It's almost... Sick. Ooh. You'll do great. I'll just be right here. Hey, it's okay to be nervous. Who said I was nervous? I didn't say I was nervous, I'm fine. I'm just saying. I'm good, I'm... I'm really terrified. Look, you'll do great. Just believe you can do this. Okay. All right. All right, I'll be right over here. Yeah. Up, up, up, up, up. Hi! Hi. Here, right here. Right here. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Okay. Samantha, it's nice to meet you. Hi. All right, folks, lock it up, one minute. - Okay. - One minute. Remember what we talked about. Be confident, play the part. You have to do this. Now, make the show. Now, we are on in, five, four, three. I can't believe it she's on TV. Yes, go Sam, go! Hi, everybody, and welcome to the show. We've got a great show tonight for you. Chef Rachel will be in with about 25 new ways to make guacamole. And up first though, we have a very special guest, it's Samantha Bradshaw. She's here. She's new to Nashville. She's a transplant, and we're gonna find out all about her. Well, let's get into it. Where do you hail from? Just I'm from the small town USA. So, you're a small town girl with big town dreams, but what brings you to Nashville? Actually, the reason that I came here was because of my sister, Amber. She was actually, she was gonna pack up her bags and she was gonna come to Nashville. And she was really, I mean, she's one of the best singers. And you're talking about her in the past tense. Does that mean she's... She passed away recently. Sorry, it's actually, it's been kinda rough, but the music has really gotten me through it, and it's because of the music, and it's because of her, and it's because of her songs. I mean, that's the whole reason I'm in this whole industry in the first place. I am so sorry for your loss, but I... I know that she would be proud of you and the person that you've become. Thanks, I hope so. Music was... That was her life. It was everything to Amber and she was always playing something. She was always playing her guitar, or singing a song, or writing a song, or doing something. She was always doing something with music, and that was... That's when she was the happiest Always when she was the most alive, you know? What terrific memories you have of her, but let's talk about your new album that's coming out. She was uninhibited. She didn't care. She wanted to do something, she did it, and she wasn't like the rest of us. She was unafraid. Now the new album coming out- - That's like what the rest of us, can you imagine if we just followed our heart and we just did it? Because I mean, all of us should be like that because if we don't, I mean, we never know when the last time we're gonna be able to do it is. We're gonna give you a little bit of a chance to collect yourself. We're gonna come back in just a minute or two with Chef Rachel, she's got some brand new guacamole recipes. And when we come back later in the show, we'll catch up with more with Samantha Bradshaw. We'll be right back. And we're out. What was that? That was humiliating! I dunno what... I thought it was on a roll. Oh, you were on a roll, Sam. I don't know what you've been smoking. But you wanted me to talk, so I was talking. I wanted you to talk about the big promotion, the album, the song, not your dead sister! Wow. You're awful. Okay, that might have been a little harsh, but you were depressing. All you talked about was Amber. I don't see what's wrong with that. Your airtime is limited it's precious, don't you understand that? I guess not. Promote, promote, promote. Talk about the album. Talk about... Talk about your wardrobe. Talk about anything really except Amber. Can you do that for me? For heaven sakes for your sister I guess, I can talk about the album more. The story about your sister is very sweet, but this is entertainment. Keep it light. People don't want to be reminded of their mortality. I need an espresso. I need an espresso. You think she's okay? Are you kidding? She's great. Maybe she was... Stumbling. Peter, the poor girl is practically filibustering up there. I mean, I thought that she was doing better, but I guess, she's not over it. Patricia, when we lose someone we love, we never really get over it, but with time it starts to hurt a lot less. And eventually, we just learn to live with the pain. I guess, I've been lying to myself. I'm not over it. Let's keep watching. It'll get better. Sam, are you all right? I don't... I don't know. Okay, I just talked to the show runner. It should come as no surprise that the network is not exactly happy with us, but we can complete our segment at the end of the show, if... If? If we make a special announcement, but it has to be something hot off the press, something exclusive. Great, great, well, I don't really have an announcement to make. Or do we? We are going to go out there and announce the official launch of your musical duo. - What? - What? I've been noodling this one around in my head for a while. Ever since I saw what a cute couple you two make. Okay, well, what are we just supposed to form a band now? No, I was thinking of a pop rock couples duo thing. Think Sonny and Cher, Donnie and Marie. Well, I think they're like, brother and sister. - Whatever. - Mm. People will eat it up. Think of how many concert tickets you'd sell. Sure, but Sam's already in a band. Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up. Well, maybe I could do both. No, see, that would confuse the marketplace, and crush us, so no. No, no, absolutely not. Well, I'm not just leaving my band. Why not? People do it all the time. No. No, I'm... No, I'm sorry, that does not sit right with me. Okay, Sam, I hate to do this to you, but you need to make up your mind now, or we can't go back out there on the air, and you can kiss your career goodbye! I can't. I really... But nothing, I had to pull a million strings to get you on this show, and this is how you repay me? Debra, can we have a moment to talk about this alone, please? Fine, but if we go back out on that set, you will make the announcement understood? Understood. Why do I put up with these brats? Sam, what are you thinking? I don't know what I'm thinking I don't know. I can't, I can't just ditch Epic Chance. I mean, that's my sister's band, but I mean, I don't know, at the same time, I can't just not go out there. I mean, Debra's gonna kill me if I don't. No, she wouldn't kill you. Okay, you might wanna get a running start. Yeah. I don't know. Wanna know what the worst part is? What? A part of me... A part of me was already considering leaving Epic Chance, and then you and me both, we could do our own thing, and I dunno, make music together. Tristan, I... What did you hear? - Enough. - Tristan, no, Tristan, come on! Tristan, hey, hey... Tristan, come back, come on! Well, we should... We should really get back out there. Wait, we're doing this? Are you sure? Yeah. I made up my mind. Let's do it. Good, okay. I should have gotten water. Oh, I think we still have time I'll go grab some. Thanks. Thank you. Don't mention it. Hey Tristan, Tristan look, you don't understand, I don't have a choice in this. Yes, you do, Sam. Okay, places, we are on in five, four, three. And welcome back everybody. We're gonna continue our conversation with singer, Samantha Bradshaw. Samantha, you brought a guest with you. Who is this? Adam Kenton, singer, songwriter. Adam, nice to know ya. How do you do, Tony? Out of my own curiosity, are you guys a couple? That's for us to know and you to find out. I just might. It seems funny to me that you would come all the way to Nashville for the music and find yourself a boyfriend. So, a little birdie told me that you two have a big announcement to make right here live on the show. Yes, yes we do, or rather, Sam does. Sam? Yes. Come on, Sam, don't be such a tease. Sam, the announcement. Um... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do this, I'm sorry. I need to go. Sam, Sam, Sam. What are you doing? I can't do this anymore. Hope you're happy. No, I'm not happy! You just threw all your careers down the toilet! Look, we're having some technical difficulties here Maybe we can cut to Chef Rachel- - Don't you run away from me! And her guacamole again, or better yet, we'll be right back. What did you just do? I'm sorry, okay? Sorry, you have no idea how sorry you're gonna be! Excuse me? Ha, have you forgotten our contract? Mm, I'm pretty sure it's no good anymore because I quit! Oh, you really think so? No, wait, wait, wait, you're totally right, you're totally right, because as of this moment, I no longer represent you. What you did out there was despicable. Well good, fine. We'll just go our separate ways. No harm done, it's fine. It's fine. No harm done! Do you know I can't ever show my face here ever again? And neither can you. I can't even stand to look at you. Fine, the feelings mutual. Oh. Amber! Amber. Ugh! Amber! Ugh. Mm, why can't I see you anymore? Morning, sunshine. Hey, do you know where Sam is? I don't know, but the van's gone. What? ♪ Cause nothing's as it seems ♪ Even in my dreams ♪ I won't let you go ♪ Cause I already know Yello? You stole my song. You stole my sister's song. Oh, relax, I didn't steal anything. Are you kidding me? Then why am I hearing it on the radio by another singer? I'm sorry, are you serious? Give it back. Give it back! Give it back! That is not yours. That is not even mine, that's my sister's. Well, she's not exactly here to defend herself now, is she? How dare you? Oh, get over yourself, kid. Obviously, you didn't even bother to read the contract. I am done with you. No. No, no. You know... You can't, that's not fair, you can't do that. No. Yes, yes, I can. Obviously, I'm not gonna go on a date with my best friend's mom, right? Cause it's weird, and that's where I got the inspiration. All right, one, two, three, four ♪ Why do I like so Hi. Hey, it's Sam, right? Yeah. Have you been crying? No, no, I'm good. I'm good, I'm fine. What are you guys doing, street performing? Street perform... Oh, this, you mean this little ditty. No, no, no, we're doing one of those French new wave, avant garde performance art things, you know? We are not street performing because that would be- - No. I mean, what- Ridiculous. Hide the tip jar. Look, I know we really haven't... So, we really haven't seen eye to eye. Really? I thought we always had a really good like back and forth kinda... Really? Oh, please. Really? You've been really rude to my sister's band, and my sister, and me. Have I really? Is this real? Is that a thing? Yeah, you were really rude, man. Yeah, like vicious. Okay, thank you. Thank you, I understand, I'm working through childhood stuff in therapy, it's repressed, I get it. Yeah. I just, I saw what happened to you guys the other night at the show. Uh, no, you saw that? Yeah, gosh that sucked. I'm really sorry that happened to you. I'm sorry you had to go through that. You really mean that? Yeah, I mean, this industry sometimes, it just sucks, man. It sucks sometimes. Yeah, right? I get it, it's cut throat, that's fine, whatever, but does everyone in our industry have to be a bag of butt bagels all the time? I don't know, maybe some people are just hiding their own insecurities. Would you like a pamphlet? Yeah, yeah, give her a thing. Sure, yeah. He did the decals on these. - Oh. - They're sick. It's disgusting. They boil lobsters alive. I better go. Doing great! He was a great drummer, yeah. It was good while he lasted. Very sensitive. So, I guess, are we like... We're like friends now, half friends? Yeah, ish friends. - Friendsish. - Ish, yeah. Yeah, yeah, all right. Yeah, sweet. Uh-oh. Oh, no. - I'm sorry. - We do a li... We do a little lobster claw. Like that's the claw, you know? - This? - The pinchers, yeah. That, me? Yeah, but you can has to catch it with a claw, so. I'm sorry, I don't... Come here... Ooh, gosh. That's the sound a lobster makes, so just go... Do I do that? No. No. Two, three. Okay. - Never done that. - Okay, cool. That was weird. Sorry. Just friendish. Actually, before I go, I just wanted to... Thanks. Why'd you do that? Just because you guys are working hard and for never giving up, yeah. This actually helps, because well, we're planning to move back home, and we're saving up. I mean, there's no place like home. It turns out Nashville wasn't the scene for us, but we still got the music and the band, right? That's what matters. Sam. I'm sorry. Are you okay? - I can't. - Oh, my... I'm so sorry! I was actually trying to help. Really, man? What did I say? No way. Amber? There you are. I was looking all over for you. Me? Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait. Am I dead, or dreaming, or both? Listen, Sam's gone. Gone? What do you mean gone? Or rather she will be. I know where she's heading, but I have to ask for your help. Can you do that for me? Of course. But I mean like, can other people see you? Honestly, it probably looks like you're talking to yourself right now. Well, that's comforting, at least I know I'm not going crazy. What in the world? Who is he even talking to? Just keep walking, look away. Thanks again. For what? For helping Sam get through this. Yeah. I know where Sam is. This is gonna sound crazy, but I saw her, Amber. In a dream or some... What are you... That's just it, it wasn't a dream, I saw her clear as day. She asked me to do something for her, and so, I'm just here to fulfill that promise. You don't believe me. That's fine. I don't blame you. It does sound crazy. It is... Crazy. Come in. We need to help Sam. And anyway, thanks for putting our differences aside. I know you're probably not the biggest fan of me right now, but thanks for hearing me out. And yeah, so that's why I'm here We should probably call her mom. Wait, you actually believe this guy? Yeah, I do. Amber would do anything for Sam. Okay, just let me get this straight. You expect us to drop everything just because a ghost told you to do so. Exactly, sort of. Can I just say something? Please. I know it sounds a little... Crazy? Unorthodox but I think we should do it. Sam needs us right now. You know Amber would want us there for her. That's my thoughts exactly. Let's do it! I'm in. I'm in too. Cool. - Wee! - Careful, she's a rental. Shotgun! Do you have everything? I do now. Grant me the serenity to... God grant me the serenity to was... Accept the things I cannot... Hello, Tristan? Yes. Sam ran away, but she's on her way here? Amber's song got stolen! What? You know what, fine, just send the contracts over to me, I will handle this. Serenity my... Papacita! Sam is coming, we got work to do. Adam, I... I'm sorry, why? What are you doing here? I'm here for you. I'm sorry. And I ruined my sister's band, and I let the stupid manager get to me, and I let it get inside my head. And I feel stupid, and I feel like... You know what the worst part is? I feel like I've let Amber down. No, you didn't. I did. You came all this way to give me a notebook? It's not just a notebook. Thank you. Guys, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry, I don't... I don't... Let's just say, someone told us you might need us right now, and yes, she was wearing yellow. Thank you. - Love you, man. - Pumpkin! Excuse me, pumpkin? Excuse me, pumpkin, hey so I found something in the contract that can help us, page eight. Mom what are you doing here? Fixing it, you know with all my divorces, I know my fair share of attorneys. True. You do. Okay, this is all legalese, you do retain the ability to buy it back. Okay. So, how much are we talking? $50,000. I know it sounds bad. It is bad. All right, hear me out. What if we raise the money with a concert? A concert. Yes, and we keep 100% of the profits. I'll take care of the venue if you can take care of gathering the artists. I mean, can you think of any? I'm in. A concert you guys? If it means taking Amber's song back from Debra, I'm in. Boom. Look, if we really wanna do this, we're gonna need a few more artists besides ourselves. What if we ask the Methodical Lobsters? The lobsters? Just throwing them a bone. It's your show, you do whatever you feel is best. I have a good feeling. Okay, so we have the lobsters, we're gonna need at least one more artist. I dunno, does anyone come to mind? Hi, Nathan, this is Sam. Look, this is gonna sound kind of crazy, but I was just wondering, I've a huge favor to ask you. What is it? The only problem is the song, Even In Dreams. Mm, we can't use that one. I mean, we tons of songs in our library. Yeah, I mean, that's fine. I don't know. I mean, I'm just kind of hoping it could be special. We can still write a new one, there's still time. Don't think we have that much time. Not like you haven't done it before. Not like this. What are so afraid of? Mm. Mm. In the middle of writing a masterpiece? More like senseless doodling. I'm so confused. What is it? I used to be able to see Amber all the time and my dreams, she's supposed to help me, and I can't see her anymore. And then, it just feels like I'm losing Amber all over again. No, no, that's just it. What, what is? Well, for some reason, she's only able to visit you when you're being true to yourself. She said, remember to be true to yourself. All right! Welcome to taking back Amber's song concert! Thanks to your generous donations, we are gonna give the power back to the original artists.

So, no pressure, right? Yeah, mom, I dunno. I still don't know what to say to everyone. Hey, what did Amber always say? When words fail music speaks. Music speaks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, she did, didn't she? Mom, it's like she's still connected to me, she is through the music. It's kind of like she never really left, not really. She's still here. ♪ Cause home is ♪ where the heart is ♪ You reach for ♪ fame much higher ♪ But distractions never last ♪ Cause home is ♪ where the heart is ♪ Yeah ♪ Home is where the heart is All right. Okay, so this next song is actually the last song, and I really don't know what to say, to be honest. But as my mom just reminded me about my sister, Amber, there's this thing she would always say, she would say that when words fail, music speaks. So, I guess, I'm just gonna do that. I'm gonna let the music speak for me.

Ugh, thank you! Oh, my. Thank you so much. You guys. Who wants to cash it? Come in. Debra Thomas? Who's asking? 50,000. Epic Chance is exercising their contractual option to re-acquire all rights to the song, "Even In Dreams." If you do anything regarding this song, we'll see you in court. Howdy. Hey, how did you know I was here? I had a hunch. So, there's a job that opened up here in town. I think I'm gonna take it. Really? I'm sorry, I should have asked first. No, no, it's not...
