Everyone driving in every direction. Where to go. Why? What to say when I get there? Open sewage ditches to break your leg in, or break your head on. Hard work, they work hard. The rich are poor, and the poor are rich, and the rich are poor. Few women, hidden women, high heeled women in the rocks and mud. I think they're a bit like Riders on the Storm, But in the daytime. It was a bit of a Steve and Terry. Hey, slouch, do you know if Jan got any of the chairs ready yet. She was buildin' 'em isn't she, remember? Yeah, got them down. I think she must have...

I wanna keep these settees free, no bottles of water on show, coffee cups tucked away, it just looks, startin' to look a bit shabby from out there, so I just want it like really clean. I think this is one of the most interesting parts of the experiment, particularly if we're gonna up the ante. 'Cause you wanted to take it like, "Oh we're just recording and there are people there all the time, so you forget about it." Yeah. Or you try and make that space useful. - Yeah. - Sometimes. Kosovo, 1998, 1999, war. 12,000 dead, 5,977 missing. 1,862 still missing. Zagorka, she carries two silver keys on her chain, she smells of the hills of her name. Its paths are in her forehead, her houses are all empty, once a day, this is her walk with the keys on the chain. I would kill them with my own hands if I knew who was responsible.

A handmade, rotting wooden ladder, a corn store, these were country people. And I'm stepping on their things in my expensive leather sandals. Could that be a little fire? What's that? Is that for the heat to come up from below? All that's left from the looting, strewn in the dust on the floor. Washington, D.C. There is a huge, white building, so huge it makes tiny the people who raise their eyes to look up at it. 100 flags are flying, 90 tourist cameras popping, 20 buses busing, and a white, giant finger pointing straight up, god it says, god. Look how you have made us. See that slit, smacked the shit out someone. You ready though? Yeah, I wanna go. Paun, Paunie, who runs the neighbourhood, she has her crew, Paunie's rolling dice for dollars, sitting in the shade on the steps outside the house. Hey! Her dog is called Money.

We go up dark, concrete steps to the third floor of Kabul's Tin Pan Alley. Here are the tailors and the musicians. London, London? London? Dorset. South, south. London! I can't do that one. In the night, play. Oh, I can't play in the evening? A Tajik man sings his soul at the end of Stonecutter Street. The blimp takes it all in, beams it back to grand control in Washington.

Woo hoo? ? Woo hoo? ? Woo hoo? Could I just drop in? That sounds like somebody being sawn in half what you're doing over there. Mist on the mountain, Istalif. The boy whistles to the birds. One white dove back flips. Ruins, the same shaper's gravestones. Who lived here? When did they leave? The children look into the camera with no affectation. We sit in silence, smile, stare, shy, curious. Us and them. Hope we know when to leave. The light is almost gone, five separate calls to prayer sang across the ravine. A few lights came on, the singing intertwined, joined for a second, harmonious, then spun off into discord. I felt my soul open to the singing. Way below, looking south, the lights of the airbase, huge and sprawling. Could be any western city. But he's amazing isn't he, that face. Wonder where he is now. ? They swept across the land? ?

So many in such a small space. All just getting on with it, going about their business. And the call to prayer spreads out its arms across the old city. The Kabul Mines Museum. English, Russian, Chinese, Pakistani, Egyptian, command detonated, made from a pressure cooker, a USA exploding pen, booby trapped loud speaker. That sounds like you've got a lot of screaming children in there. Well, that's what you like. ? That's what they want? ? >4' Oh yeah 4' ?

East of the river, the river is the dividing line between the Washington that's prosperous and the Washington that's not. Field trip with Paul Schwartzman from the Washington Post. We're now in Northwest Washington which is sort of like the bookend to Southeast and Northeast. It's predominantly white and highly educated here. I call it happy land. I mean could this be anymore different from Anacostia? Washington's fallen in love with the glass office building. This city of secrets is tryin' to go transparent. Lots of trench coats around here. Guys in trench coats, going to meetings. Lots of meetings. This is federal Washington, this is the movie set. And the interaction with the neighbourhoods and this is like zero. I heard there's no metro in Georgetown 'cause they don't want blacks to reach their neighbourhood. The other side of the river. I'm getting there, I'm gettin' there. I can hear it! Oh! Ah, that's better! ? Oh my Anacostia? ? Do not sigh? ? Do not weep X It's beautiful, isn't it? ? In the water? ? Wade in the water? ? Children wade? ? In the water? ? God's gonna trouble the water? - Shape. - Yes. Upon a vision of your faith. In Lord Jesus Christ, your repentance of sin and obedience to his command, I now baptise you in the name of the Father, the name of the Son, the name of the Holy Spirit. - All right! - All right! Woo! Yeah. ? Wade in the water? ? Children, wade in the water? ? Oh my Anacostia? ? Do not sigh? ? Do not weep X ? Beneath the overpass? ? Your saviour's waiting patiently? ? Walking on the water? ?

Wells-Barnett, she says what I did not yet know so intensely was the hatred of the white American for the black, a hatred so deep, that I wonder if every white man in this country, when he plants a tree, doesn't see a Negro hanging from its branches. Sheelus! Try unspeakable, then follow along! Try unspeakable and follow! That's it, bra. That's what'll clear everything up. I tell you as a young man I used to look at people and they would fail me. I mean even Christians and even people, pastors, but I tell you, you know who never failed me, and you know who was there with me in the hardest times of my life? Jesus. - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Even when I felt like I was gonna go out of mind, even when I wanted to blow my brains out, Jesus was there. Save me. And stop everything, and save me. Jesus. That wonderful, beautiful name. - Yes. - Everybody just say Jesus. Jesus. A man's man who loved even children. God, Hove Jesus. I sure love Jesus. I used to hate people, but then Jesus found me. - Hallelujah! - And he changed me. ? This is the ministry I ? Of defence I ? Stairs and walls are? ? All that's left a' ? Mortar holes let'? ?

Because I was tending to go ? Here? ? Ls the ministry? 'Cause I was feeling the funk even though - ...you didn't hear it. - Right. Was definitely in your head, the funk, for sure. It was definitely in my head. Every time I walk past that, I check to see if my elephant is still there. I really do! Everything about it look like an elephant. The head, the strings of the trees, the tusks. You can see the eyes, you can see the horns, - ...the ivory tusks. - Yeah you can see everything. The whole shape is a elephant. Yeah! A full-grown elephant. Yeah. I think it's beautiful. I got forwarded, forwarded an email asking if we were going to be recording this 192 and 24 bit, that's the only communication I've had at any part of this process. The last album was the same thing. They didn't hear a single thing, and then Polly invited the top sort of half a dozen people down to her house in Dorset, made them all a cup of tea, put on the mastered CD and then went out and did some gardening and left them... To listen to it and then came back in after the gardening. What do you think chaps? It's great, isn't it? ? If you want to cry out? ? You can't if you want to cry out? ? You can if you want to cry out? ? You can? ? Oh, oh, oh? Are we gonna... Or should we do ? You can't I - I'll do that. - Sounds a bit weird doesn't it? I didn't want to mention it. ? You can't I It had been raised earlier Not in your presence. Anyway. So it's started "if you wanna cry out, you can, if you wanna", no... No, I'm not gonna be able to keep a straight face while I'm singin'. Tell me again how it's meant to go. ? If you want? Hang on. ? If you want to cry out? ? You can't I ? Oh, oh, oh? So it's just the second time around, second time through, it doesn't through the f. Yeah. - Okay, Anacostia, gospel service, Palm Sunday, 11:00 a.m. And they designed it that way! I don't care how many vigils or prayer services we have, there will always be guns and drugs in our community. Drugs and guns. They will always be here says the woman with the short red hair. The choir raise their hands, show their palms, open, facing forward, I have a victory, you won it all for me. The Lord, Jesus, is black. His black beard is going Gray at the roots, maybe he dyes it like the Afghan elders. A one, two, three four ? Here's the Hope Six Demolition Project s ? Stretching down to Benning Road I ?

Father Sava says we want to belong, it's human nature, so we look for the group or the clan to get together. If you don't have to break the branch, don't do it. If you don't have to kill the animal, don't do it. We spent all day in the accursed mountains in the heat. I saw a procession of nervous boys dressed in blue and gold on their way to be circumcised. Sheltered by decorated umbrellas held by their fathers on the back of a cart. The Romani drummers who were sweating, dark-skinned, smelling of salt. One of them is stoned, his eyeballs bloodshot. The men dance slowly in white felt hats, up there in the hills, ancient things. But they make hay in the old way, in the cool of the evening. And me, the only woman present allowed by the village elder, his face was a map I need to study closely. IDada? ? Dadadada? IDada? IDada? ? Dadadada? IDada? IDada? ? Dadadada? IDada? Yeah yeah yeah, just keep the energy and the punk up, let's just listen back to that one. It's quite European. And then yeah, we can, then it's just a matter of experimenting with what drop out. I can hear that verse three and like loads of stuff coming out, and then all coming back up. And it could be just, I like the idea of it voices and one thing. Hm. Ding ding ding ding, and maybe the organ. One other thing I wanted to get, is something else, is that amazing oowah that you got us to do. There's been so many things that, when we've listened back to what we have stand out a mile. And I've realized that they've all come from you. And it's usually, you make a suggestion, and we all think, we all go like this, and kinda what is he? And it ends up being really something. Glad I taught you all you know. Yeah, exactly, I learned from the master, mistress. Whatever you wanna pay madame, no. I'm just digging myself deeper. All about that circle, we love that circle, T13 'til I die, and for the circle, we gonna hold the circle down. Hold up, I'm with the mic, chill, not right now. Paunie, this is the Southeast where they wear t-shirts that say R.l.P., last year they killed a kid just for his shoes. He got shot behind the circle after they hit him in his back behind the circle. I was born right here, I was raised down there. Yeah. All my people died around here though. My cousin, my cousin shot hisself in the head in that buildin' over there. Killed hisself, shot hisself right in the head, bow! My father got shot at the bus stop right there. Then my other cousin, Kevin, got smoked right here from this buildin' right here. He just came home from all the Feds, he been home for like a week, they shot him right here in front of this building. Oh, look there.

Yeah, that shit, it ain't quiet, it's quiet right now, probably 'cause it's cold, everybody in they honeycomb hideouts, it ain't quiet down in this muthafucka. There's a lot of violence now, isn't it? A lot of violence. Then another time, I almost got killed again, when the first entrance with that, where they put that house at, there used to be woods and shit, man come up out there smokin' and shit, and nigga like, "Hey Paun, there's somethin' out." Boom boom boom boom! Man, we're runnin', nigga, we ran and left me, jumped the big ass gate this high, ain't never seen nobody run that fast.
