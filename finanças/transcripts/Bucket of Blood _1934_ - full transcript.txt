Come along. The doctor is waiting to see you. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Sit down. I know why you've sent for me. And I am glad you have. Because there's something I want to ask you. Why do all these people think I am mad? I am not mad. I am nervous. Terribly nervous. But I am not mad. My senses .. have been sharpened. Not dulled. My sense of hearing is so acute. That I can hear everything. All the tiny sounds of the earth. And the fluttering of insect's wings. The falling of the smallest flower. Listen. I can hear your watch ticking. I can hear your heart beating. And yet they all persist in saying I am mad. But I will prove to you that I'm not. Observe how quietly. How calmly I can tell you the whole story. It is impossible to say when the idea first entered my brain. Once conceived. It haunted me. Day and night. I had nothing against the old man. He had always been perfectly kind to me. But it was his eye. It was like a vulture's eye. A pale blue eye with a film over it. Horrible. I had been ill. A seizure. [ Door knocks ] [ Voice of female singing ] The old man told me you were ill again, darling. Don't work tomorrow. Let's go into the woods and drift. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Why didn't you open the door, darling? I didn't know it was you, dear. I thought it was somebody else. [ Singing ] Rest tonight, dear. Try and sleep. I can't sleep. All the little noises of the night keep me awake. The creaking walls and stairs of this old house. Sometimes I can even hear the beating of that old man's heart. Well. Goodbye. [ Door knocks ] Come in. I thought you were ill again, my boy. Oh no. Just a slight accident. Did you enjoy yourself today? I saw you in a boat. Thanks for the wine. If you don't mind, I'll go to bed now. I am awfully tired. Goodnight. Goodnight. [ Throbbing heartbeats ] [ Clock ticking ] For seven nights. I went down to his room intending to kill him. And rid myself of his horrible eye forever. I shone my light on his face. But his eyes were closed. He looked so peaceful that I couldn't do it. Then one night. Who is there? Who is that? Who is that? Who is that? [ Throbbing heartbeats ] [ Door knocks ] We heard a report from a neighbour of yours .. That she heard a terrible scream coming from this house. Oh. It was I who screamed. I had a nightmare. We'll have to investigate in order to make out a report. So, as a formality we'll just look over the house. Very well. A quaint old knife this. Yes. I got it out east. Is it valuable? - No. Just a curio. Hmm. There's only one more room now. It's on the floor below. I suppose you would like to see it. We may as well. Well. Everything seems to be alright, sir. We'll be going now. Perhaps you would like a drink? My friend has some wine. Thanks very much, sir. Sit down. Are you staying here alone, sir? Why .. why yes. For the present. My old friend who lives here with me. Went away to the country this evening. He will be away for some time. A nice wine, sir. Yes, Yes. Have some more. Sorry. He seems to be a nervous sort of young man. Perhaps we'd better leave and let him get to bed. I was in the woods today. It was wonderful there. The flowers. The sky. The clouds. Some strange old trees. Look at how dark it is outside. Daylight in a few hours. When the whole world begins to live again. People will go about their business. We shall have to live through another day. And after that. Many days. And days. And days. The shops and parks will be opening. And the whole business of life will begin again. And so on. And on. And on. And on. Repeating itself forever. [ Throbbing heartbeats ] [ Throbbing heartbeats ] You stupid fools. I deceived you as easily as if you were children. I killed that old man. I killed him. I killed him. I killed him to get rid of his horrible eye. Listen to the beating of his hideous heart. He is here I tell you. In this very room. Under your stupid feet. Fools. Fools. Idiots. He's been here all the time. All the time I tell you. All the time you've been searching he's been here. He is under the floor. Here! ..f-s..
