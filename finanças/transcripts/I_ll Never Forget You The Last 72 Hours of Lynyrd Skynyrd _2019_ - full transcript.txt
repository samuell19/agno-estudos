- Ronnie liked to talk. He was no bragger, he didn't need no sympathy, none of that stuff. But after several shots of whiskey when he was a little tipsy, at that point in time Ronnie Van Zant looked for sympathy or attention. And so, something would bring up this, I don't think I'm gonna live to be 29. October 20th 1977, Gene Odom lost his best friend, and the world lost the leader of the hugely popular southern rock band, Lynyrd Skynyrd. We weren't happy with this airplane. Pilot says everything's good, let's go. If it's your time to go, it's your time to go. Gene came back and told us to buckle up. We were gonna try to put it down and then some people panicked and it got a little tense. We started clipping trees and then it went bang, bang, bang and that's all I remember. The plane crash in Gillsburgh, Mississippi killed Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and copilot William Gray. Gene Odom, the band's security guard and Van Zant's lifelong friend and fishing buddy survived the crash and along with several others including Leslie Hawkins, the lead backup singer, and Craig Reed, the band's guitar tech. They share their stories of the 72 hours leading up to the crash and its aftermath. This is a tribute, a celebration, a reminder that I'll Never Forget You. - Ronnie lived on this side of Woodcrest and I lived on that side of Woodcrest but we still grew up together, playing ball and riding bikes, running around, you know. And fishing buddies, we loved to fish. - He was always with Ronnie when I saw him and they were such good friends and always fishing buddies. - And we didn't know how to fish back then because a lot of times we would lose 'em because the line couldn't handle some of them big ol' bass but we caught thousands of 'em and we really got into it. But what Ronnie Van Zant always wanted was an old truck and he wanted a trophy bass and April or May of that year whatever, he got him that old 55 Chevy truck. This was May of 77. He called me and said, "Man, let's go fishing. "Come pick me up, we'll go to the lake." We started fishing, he was in front of the boat. I was in the back of the boat, paddling or whatever. He had a purple nine inch monster worm. He throwed it in the eelgrass and that worm hit the water, when it hit the water. I said man there's your trophy bass, son. Set the hook and keep him out of that grass. I got him now, roll that big ol' bass over in the boat. Ronnie Van Zant, I thought he was gonna swamp the boat. Ron's screaming, I just suck at this! He grabbed me. Man, Gene, this is it. I said yeah, no doubt, let's go weigh it. So we went and weighed it. It weighed 12 pounds, eight ounces, that was his trophy bass. And he got that bass back from the taxidermy just before the plane crash. So he did get the two things he wanted. He wanted that old truck and he wanted the big bass and he got those and I'm mighty proud that I was with him in that boat that day that he got that big ol' bass. - Allen and Bob were in my English class in school and those guys were the funniest two. You saw one, you saw the other and they're always pulling tricks and stuff. Allen sat behind me in English class and then Bob sat behind Allen so Bobby was always beating on the back of his chair and then Allen was playing with my hair, I had real long hair. Lynda, you got a pencil? He was always bugging me for pencils, paper, you name it, he was ready. He was ready 'cause of me. Ronnie, he was one of a kind. He was great, everybody loved him. I was here to hear One Percent. It was great, everybody, all the people from school, we were all out here, everybody dancing and having a good time, they loved 'em. They loved 'em and we just knew he was gonna do something and he sure did. - He worked at his brother in law's auto parts store, Morris Auto Supply way over on University and Beach Boulevard and Ronnie became the manager of that store and I went there parts running and this was somewhere in 69. Back then if stores sold so much, thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stock they would get an all expense paid vacation somewhere, wherever it was that year. That year it was Honolulu, Hawaii. He gave the two free tickets, all expense paid, Honolulu to Lacy. Sister wouldn't fly, Ronnie Van Zant hated to fly, he wouldn't fly, Donnie and Johnny, the other kids were just too young, so Lacy asked me do you want to go to Honolulu on an all expense paid weeks vacation and I went yeah, I'm in. Went to Honolulu, Hawaii, all expense paid vacation, came back home, my draft papers was in the mailbox. I was drafted May of 1969. Everybody was getting drafted and we knew Ronnie wouldn't be because he was 4F. All of his friends, my friends, our friends, they all got drafted and I went to go into basic training and I went to artillery training in Oklahoma, then expecting to go to Vietnam. Then my orders come down and I was sent to Germany and so, fantastic. When I got there, the night I got there, the officer was checking my records, yeah, you gonna be an A battery. They like to fight and people like to get drunk and fight. I said I don't drink but I like to fight, so I'll be right at home. Then he was flipping on me, he went, you're a welder. I said yeah, I'm a union hour worker, I'm a welder. He said man, our welder died yesterday, I'm battalion maintenance, you're gonna be the new welder. I went well, the best job in the world. Pulled no duty, within 13 months I was an E5, spec five. So I went from welder to parts runner and I loved both of 'em. I would always get things done when I go DX parts. There was something we needed because everything was going to Vietnam, we couldn't get parts. I'd go out there and talk to the sergeant and say man, I need to get this off of the truck, we're arguing, so I'd hustle parts and get things fixed and so one officer said before you get out of here we like what you do, we'll give you staff sergeant E6 today and 10,000 dollars VRB, variable reenlistment bonus and guarantee you in three years you'll be a warrant officer if you reenlist, and I said no sir, I'm a freebird, I like to go fishing, I don't want to be tied down like this. The biggest mistake of my life was not doing that. The second biggest mistake of my life was going to work for the band and so if I'd have stayed in the Army I'd have been an officer, but I wouldn't have been with my buddy when he passed away. God has his, they say he has his reasons for everything and he don't tell you what they are. - I was the first one hired and I was leader of the girls. I got hired probably in November before we started rehearsals in December. Then Cass and Joe came in to audition and it worked so wasn't much to it. We started rehearsing and there you go. We did our first gig right about New Year's in London. - People say how did you get involved with them? It's weird, it's like I was just put there. I had a 10 minute window to meet this band and I kind of hit it. I was just right there when I needed to be, it was crazy. I was checking into a hotel with some lady. I just got divorced from one and going right into another one and we went into a hotel and as I was checking in the lady said that The Who were staying in the rooms adjoining me and I went The Who in a Holiday Inn in Kent, right. So I went around there and here's two roadies unloading a U-Haul trailer pulled by a four door Econoline van and obviously not The Who and I said hey y'all playing here in the hotel? And he goes we're Lynyrd Skynyrd and I had never heard of them at that time and he said we just got off tour with The Who and I go that's where that came from. So Allen and Billy and Gary stuck their head around and told the roadies to ask 'em if I had some weed, which I did, so that kind of was how I met 'em and so I was partying with them the weekend and I just kind of got along with them and I was a mechanic so I'm kind of mechanically inclined and they were working around and I just kind of fitted in and Ed figured they could train me to set up drums. So that's what I did and Ed said he wanted to hire me and Ronnie said the Yankee? He's a fucking Yankee. He was a nice guy but there's people that I would rather hire than some Yankee so he told Ed if I didn't work out he was gonna kick his ass. I think they were looking for a street person like I was that could manipulate whatever they needed because that's kind of what I was doing. So I kind of furnished them and I remember the first show I did in San Diego, California, we opened up for Dave Mason and after I got done setting up the drums and tearing down the drums because we were the opening act I went out and picked up women and drugs out of the audience and brought them backstage, so that was kind of my job. - I actually didn't party when we were at home. I didn't hang out with anybody. I had two kids, they were 11 and 12 at the time of the crash, so when we came home I went home and came out when we went again or if we had to rehearse or whatever which after the initial rehearsal period there wasn't a whole lot of that and we just, Ronnie knew what he wanted, when we came in we put it together and there you go. And we did a lot of things together, we had dinners and food fights and there was just a lot that went on. Just every day was pretty crazy. I remember Billy got locked out in the hall without his clothes one night, that was Dean and Leon threw somebody in his room and he came out screaming and cussing at Leon with nothing but his boots on and they locked him out of his room. There were things like that that were probably not real funny to other people but pretty funny from a distance which is where I was. It did get old being thrown out but we got thrown out of some really nice places. It was just always something going on. - Throwing TV's in the pool from the 10th floor while they're plugged in. We would go get an extension cord so it was on when it hit the pool. You'd get attempted murder or something these days for that stuff, you know. We'd take the fire hose down and stick it under somebody's door and turn it on. Soak the whole floor, have to pay for all the carpet, that was insane. We got throwed out of every hotel in Denver, Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Saint Louis, London. - Another time in London we had been there and somebody had a row with a carney, it was a carney convention going on and somebody got in a row about that and first thing you know Artimus and Gary are breaking into the convention room and wanted to have a fight with the carneys. Oops, wrong room, it was the Police Boxing League, so that didn't turn out too well. So we had to leave another nice hotel. - As long as I could party, anybody in the band, that's what was going on, we were allowed to do it as long as we performed when we were supposed to, we could do anything we wanted to do, which is kind of, you're teetering on the edge there. So you couldn't get away with that stuff these days that we did, you'd be thrown in prison. I was pretty bad. As a professional roadie, I wouldn't consider myself. I was 26 years old when the plane crashed and I was just a professional partier that happened to do guitars as far as I'm concerned but when the plane crashed it was weird because people wanted Lynyrd Skynyrd's guitar tech and that was me and I was far from being professional. As far as I was concerned but it was kind of cool because I worked for Lynyrd Skynyrd, Journey and Foreigner so I was the guitar tech for three bands that are in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame and I don't even play guitar. - It was winter of 76, he called me up, he said let's go get something to eat or whatever. Me and Judy is gonna come by and pick you up. And he says you want to do this? I want you to be my bodyguard and get it straightened up. He was off this stuff. Man, I was still, I'm not sure I wanted to be a part of this. - Gene was like Ronnie's best friend from childhood, I had heard stories about Gene from Ronnie. Ronnie and I got pretty close before Gene got involved so he had told me stories about the Odom family and how rowdy they were. And then it was weird because when Gene came in, Gene didn't do any drugs and didn't ever smoke pot or drink liquor or nothing, so he was just kind of. - I never do it. Never drank, never done drugs, never will. I take heart medicine, stuff like that, prescription medicine for my heart but I've never smoked a cigarette, never tasted alcohol, so he says okay, this is a summer tour, let's just go out there and do what you can do and let's think about this, let's talk about this, but I want you to work for me, I want you to take care of us, I want you to get us off of this crap. So I did. - So I really didn't know him that well other than coming and going. He was with Ronnie a lot and I knew that he had been friends with Ronnie for years. - Gene was kind of like today like Lebron James when he brings his posse on and they kind of travel with him, that's kind of like what Ronnie wanted to bring some of his childhood friends into the situation. - I knew him, we were there together, he was just running people offstage that didn't belong and trying to do his job and we were trying to do our job but who he was having to focus on were the people that had a big drug and alcohol problem. - Gene kind of, Ronnie brought Gene in just as another pair of eyes, just kind of hey Gene, blend in, look around, tell me what you see and so he did. He saw what I did, what Chuck, Raymond, Joe Barnes, Kevin and just kind of went around and checked out what was going on and then went and reported to his buddy Ronnie what was happening and there was a lot of information came around and I was also, I kind of was an insider for Ronnie. He'd say hey, if you see anything going on, let me know. This is a working machine kind of thing and if there's a loose cog, let's fix it. And if I don't know about, we can't fix it. Let's work together as a team and get in there and go and that's kind of what we did. Ronnie wanted to clean it up, but he needed to look in the mirror and clean himself up too because he was bitching about people drinking while he was drunk. - At the time Gene came in, there were a lot of problems that were from excessive alcohol and just kind of you get bored and you go off the deep end and there had been a lot of that going on for a long time and Allen was starting to have trouble with numbness in his hands and it was just kind of getting out of hand and it was either tighten up for longevity or it would be live hard, die young and that was gonna be the fate of the band pretty much Ronnie felt like if it didn't get straightened out. He was just trying to keep everybody headed in a better direction, so that was Gene's job. Just kind of tighten it up, stay on track or I'll beat ya. Not really but you know what I mean. - To start out, I would go to the show early, take a taxi or limousine over. And there would always be whiskey and booze. I started taking bottles, putting 'em in towels, wrapping 'em up, hiding them, giving them to security or giving them to people so they wouldn't be in there when the band came in and the crew all this liquor and the crew come in, get a few drinks, and when the band come in, so I weened them off of alcohol to a certain point. And Ronnie, the drugs, the drugs would be next. He says this is gonna be a little more difficult than the liquor thing that you're doing. You're doing a good job. Anaheim, California, 93,000 people, they go ahead with Peter Frampton run two shows there, one day and the next day. Ronnie and Allen and Gary come walking down the hill all the way toward me. Ronnie grabbed me, he said man, there's 93,000 people out there and we just kicked their butts sober. We're all sober thanks to you Gene, keep it up, man. And Gary and Allen went yeah man, you're doing great. They might've had a drink but they weren't drunk. - Some different reactions. Sometimes. Everybody liked Gene, it wasn't that there was any problem as far as personality or anything. There were some people that were a little disgruntled about not as much alcohol around and I heard the word babysitter used a couple of times, they didn't like having a babysitter, but it's sometimes appreciated, sometimes not. - He took his job as what I'm supposed to do and he did it well. Whether people liked it or not, he was there and he was gonna protect him no matter what. And not just Ronnie, the whole band. He was good at that. - And everybody had their job. Ron did this and that and Dean Kilpatrick kind of kept Ronnie's, did more personal things, and then Gene just came in light a watchdog, so sometimes the dog's happy and sometimes he's not. - When they were getting clean and that was Gene's main job, to keep those boys clean, especially Ronnie, and they were all happy and excited, everything was going right. - October 17th of 77 we were rooming together on that tour because we were setting everything up, we needed to talk so he didn't want to be wandering around to different rooms so they had lined up an autograph session, an album signing, at the Altamont Mall there, Tower Records I believe it was. Ronnie remained in his bed. I say at a budget meeting, tour schedules are coming up and you're doing a budget, I said what happens when y'all are all sitting around table to do the budget and everything's set. He said what do you mean. I said when you're sitting there at the table before you and Gary sign the checks, what happens, what goes on? Man, I don't understand what you're talking about. We just had a meeting. We were talking about the budget and everything. I say there's a lot of liquor and there's a lot of cocaine, a lot of drugs. By the time you sign the check, you're drugged out and you're drunk. You're tipsy and you invest in everything he's saying. Just sign it. - There was a lot of money being made, they were superstars, and the money should've been a lot more. It was good money, but it took a while for them to get that. - Ronnie was most certain, there were gonna be changes, everybody knew that. - I feel that they just are robbing you and he said man, I'm just not sure Gene. I said listen, your merchandising, where's that money going? They're putting it in savings accounts. I said you don't even own your merchandising business. Your manager and your secretary own your merchandising business. - If you look at the live album on the inside where Dean had drawn pictures of everybody, I'm the one on the soapbox and there's somebody standing on the side throwing money, well that was Mary Beth from the office. She was also responsible for making sure I had insurance, so he knew a lot of money was being thrown away and we were losing a lot of money here and there and everywhere and of course right after the crash, supposedly, second hand info for me, was that a million dollars was not accounted for immediately in concessions but Ronnie knew there were problems and that was gonna be dealt with, we all knew that, but how, who, how, what, I wasn't privy to any of that. - Now what's your plan? I said the plan is take over, take your management. Bring it back, bring it to you. I said you want to fire the management or you want me to fire them? And he says, so we get a legal team, get legal advice, and he said I want the lawyer to handle all that because I don't want to, I'm gonna be there, or be in another room, but we gonna have this all legal. He said because there's gonna be a big lawsuit, their management gonna sue. He says I'm ready. So I set a legal team up that the day after the tour, the fall tour, the day after that tour's over they were gonna come to the office and say look here, this is the new address, this is where everything comes, to this new headquarters. And he says you're not ready to be a manager. I said no I'm not, I can manage the security. I said number one I'm not smart enough. I said Bill Fares. I'm not sure Bill Fares wants to travel, be on stage, got a college education, good, good man. He said I'm not sure he wants to travel, I said he don't have to travel. Bill can do this out of his house. And Ronnie you're the one that told me to manage a band all you need is a telephone. He said yeah, you're right. I said okay, so he says everything's under control. I said yeah, the day after the tour's over, we'll be there in the office. I said okay, now can I tell the band what I'm really doing? No, nope, can't tell anybody, my wife don't know. Nobody knows until this thing, the hammer falls. Don't say nothing. Okay, I promise, so nobody knew. This was two nights before the plane crashed in Lakeland, Florida. October 18th, we finished the show and we come back after the shows over, get back to the hotel and everything. We talked again because he was really jittery about what was fixing to come down the road and he was more concerned about it not getting out. Making sure that nobody knew nothing. So then we basically just got ready to fly and then we got up the next day to go to Greenville, South Carolina and that's when it started, the nightmare on the plane. We boarded the plane, uneventful, like the rest of the boarding the planes, whatever. So taxiing down the runway and as the plane started to lift off, we got up, not far, a few feet or whatever, and the right engine, which I was sitting, the right engine was right there. We had a poker table back there, I was sitting here, and a ball of fire, blew fire 15 feet long come out the back of it, pow-boom! I don't know if you've ever been in a situation like that but it scared the tar out of me and everybody else and so I thought the engine blowed up so I get out of my seat and they're getting up, 52 degree angles, so I'm pulling myself to the cockpit and I get between the door. Walter McCreary and John Gray, the copilot. I said hey, better turn the plane around, man, the engine blowed up. And they're fighting the plane to get up. Just go sit down, we know what to do with this plane. I said man, that engine blowed up and a ball of fire just came out of it. I said turn the plane around, turn the plane around right now. That's it, land it. And so he said, man, there's nothing wrong with that, you need to go sit down, strap yourself in. Sit down as they fight and the engine was performing at that point. So we got up to altitude and I went back up there. I said y'all need to turn this thing around, that engine, they said man, there aint nothing wrong with that engine, that engine's fine. I said it backfired, did something, blowed a ball of fire out. He said, then he kind of got a little, the Walter McCreary guy said look here, there ain't nothing wrong with that engine, nothing wrong with this plane, everything's fine. - We weren't happy with this airplane. My son had been out with us in South Florida and we had a problem, the plane didn't want to start and we actually stopped in Gainesville the day before and let my son off. I had my Mom come pick him up because I was afraid for him to be out on it. And it was well, we're getting rid of this plane, we're not gonna have this, just put up with it a little bit longer, it's okay. The plane wasn't right, we all knew it wasn't right and as a mother you don't, you'll chance things yourself that you're not gonna chance with your children. And if there's anything you're not happy with, then don't do it. Cass did not wanna fly when we were in Greenville, but she had wanted to go in the trucks and they had already gone, they went straight from the gig and hit the road because it was a long ride to Baton Rouge. She just didn't wanna be on the plane and I don't know when that came about, if the feeling just grew, but at that point she wanted to fly commercial. And so we checked, we called some of the airlines and there was a possibility of going commercial, but it was gonna be close. When we came in was gonna be close to gig time and we had to have permission to do that so we had gone to talk to the pilots, that was the first thing we did and ran into John Gray in the courtyard and they thought that everything was okay. Both of them, neither one of them were impaired or anything like that. McCreary was real straitlaced, didn't drink, didn't do anything. He was ex military and inspired confidence, and of course they were flying the plane. They felt comfortable so I didn't have that feeling that Cass had and we went to Ronnie's room and he was already mad when we got there. There had been a personal matter and so Ronnie was trying to sleep, couldn't sleep, and just basically it was you're on that plane. It's fine, you're on the plane or hit the road. Right then he was mad and he was tired so anyway, we were on the plane. - And so the 20th was a day off. We got up after the show in Greenville which was a fantastic show. I went to check with the pilots in their room but they weren't there so I went down to the front desk to ask them about the pilots and the girl said they went out to the airport. So I took a taxi cab or a limousine, I can't remember now, out to the airport and they had the cowl thing pulled back, the separator pulled back and they were working on it. As I walked up, they put the cowl back on it, whatever you call that thing. And I said hey what's up, they said we just checking this thing out. I says we gonna get it fixed before we leave? Said we think we got mag needle problem, got a problem with the mag needle and we're gonna fly to Baton Rouge. I said we got the day off, fix it here. The mechanic's flying to Baton Rouge. I said have the mechanic fly here. He said no, we're gonna fly to Baton Rouge. I said yeah, but I'm security for this band and I want you to have the mechanic fly here and fix the plane here and he said you don't make them decisions. I said man, look here, this ain't no car. I said you got a problem, fix it here. He said listen, you don't know nothing about this, I'm the pilot, I tell you what to do on this plane. I said yeah, we ain't on the plane right now and you're making a big mistake. He said no, I can fly this plane on one engine if I have to. Who would be so stupid to try to fly a plane, he said listen, I know what I'm doing. I said you gonna take this plane up in the air with a problem when you can fix it here? And I said why you wanna be so stupid. He says I snap my fingers and make one phone call and you'll be off of this plane. It don't make no difference, I said you're still a fool to take this thing up with a problem, it's not a car. He said, you say one more thing to me. And I was got my pocket knife out, I was gonna walk up and stab the tire on the plane so he couldn't go up with it but between 50, 60 feet or whatever it was I'm thinking if I do that, that tire's gonna explode because it's got so much air pressure on that airplane its gonna probably blow my head off or kill me or mess the tarmac up, be sued or something. I turn around, I come back I said, I put my pocket knife back in my pocket and I said man, and he said listen, don't you say another word to me or I'll take you off of this plane. He said I know what I'm doing. I said there's a whole lot of people on this plane that I'm responsible for. He says I told you again, I'm the pilot, I'm responsible. I know what I'm doing. You do your job, I'll do mine. I said you're a fool and I walked away. But it all boiled down to okay, we've got a night off. Would you rather have the night off in Greenville, South Carolina or have the night off in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. That was the reason that they chose to fly, or the combination of things. Okay, we'd rather have the night off and party in Baton Rouge than have the night off and party I little old hillbilly hick-ville Greenville, South Carolina. So that was throwed into the package. Okay, okay, alright, the pilot says everything's good. Don't worry about Gene Odom, the pilot says everything's safe, you can fly. That really ate at my heart for a long time because I should've stopped the plane but I didn't and he depended on me to take care of him and that ate me up for years and still does. And at the very last minute, Ronnie Van Zant, hey okay, pilot says everything's good, let's go. If it's your time to go, it's your time to go. Ronnie Van Zant just didn't know it was his time to go. And so we boarded the plane, but pilot error, pilot ignorance, and they had an engine problem that they didn't know what it was. In the FAA report, they checked both mag needles, both mag needles worked properly so it wasn't a mag needle problem that they thought they was having, it was a problem that they didn't know what it was but took it up, they took the plane up. - I was pretty hungover still and I was like rolled on the plane and I think Mark Howard, I wanted to play cards, so I think Mark Howard scooted over to the aisle from the aisle to the window so I could just fall in that chair and he got pretty messed up in the plane because he was on the outside. He got his hips messed up pretty good but I escaped it pretty good, it was just my ribs and a concussion and stuff. - Ronnie had come to me when we first got on the plane, he was up all night the night before. He said man, I gotta get some sleep, I took two sleeping pills, one of the girls gave me two sleeping pills so I gotta get to sleep. So I said here's a pillow, there's a table there by the couch. Gary, Allen and Kevin Elson were sitting on the couch at a little skinny table there. I says lay down in here under their feet and people can walk to the galley back and forth and won't be interfering so he was over there. - I was over the wing on the right side and Cass was over the wing on the left side. - We're playing poker, we're flying on there and the engine started. Engine starts sputtering, we start running out of gas. And then they would start and then when an engine would suck up some fuel and pull the air, it would spin the plane sideways. And you're 10,000, 12,000 feet in the air. That aint no place to be doing no kind of crazy stuff like that. Everybody shook up, Kevin goes I'll run back to the pilot. Billy Powell said they were changing fuel tanks. They were trying to figure out why there was no fuel. They were trying to do everything they could do. And so I run up to the cockpit and I see now see. And he went strap everybody in, get everybody up and strap 'em in and we're going back a belly landing. - Gene came back and told us to buckle up, we were gonna try to put it down. And then some people panicked and it got a little tense. - I kicked Ronnie in the ribs, get up man! And I went back up there and I said now see what you've done. And then it lost its airspeed and it started coming in. I knew we weren't gonna make that field. I said see what you've done, now we're not gonna make it. I said I hope y'all live through this so I can kill both of ya. I ran, got and grabbed Ronnie up off the floor, he was zonked out from those two sleeping pills, I mean zonked. I grabbed him up and I went get up man. I pushed him around I guess, the plane's crashing, man. He's don't be messing with me man, I gotta get some rest. Come on, man. I push him and I'm strapping him in I said man, I'm not joking. I said, I've got him put up, he's put up, I said the plane's crashing man, I'm not. Come on, man. So I slapped him, I said the damn plane's crashing! Put your head down! - There wasn't anything you could do about it so you just buckled up and prayed. - The night of the crash, I was the fire chief of the Gillsburg Volunteer Fire Department. And when I walked in the house, the phone rang. It Stewart Hetfield, he was a member of the fire department and he lived in Gillsburg. He had saw a plane go over his house and it looked like it was going down so we just took up the highway towards McComb. Didn't know really where to go but when we got to this area I could see the helicopter. - Then the phone rang and my aunt called and said there's a plane going down straight towards your house. So then we realized what that helicopter was doing. - When I got in the woods it was dark up in the woods and it was getting dark in the field and I went to the airplane, I got down on my hands and knees, I prayed to God, help me and help them. And when I raised up and walked to the plane, the first person I saw was the pilot and he was upside down and I knew I couldn't help him. I'm gonna say I was the first one at the plane crash, there was nobody there when I walked around that plane twice but me. - It was six o'clock, 6:30, getting a little dark and at that time I was planting rye grass and they needed a big tractor up there to help move the stuff around so I brought my tractor up here. - I was in a local drug store called the K and B and I heard on the radio inside the store broke in about a plane crash outside of Magnolia. I radioed for the crash site and they told me the crash site, directions and I had them to repeat it two other times because it was directing me straight to my family farm and arriving out here I saw what looked like a command center being put together. We need to be able to get across the field and across that creek because the plane crash is on the other side of the creek. - When I woke up I was laid out across the headrest on the left side which was next to Bill. He had laid me across there and all I could see, I couldn't move my head. Of course I broke my neck but not fatally and it didn't wanna move so I just was still and all I could see was a wall of debris and somebody's legs, somebody's short stubby legs, so I'm not sure to this day who that was. Billy, Leon, Gary, all of them, it could've been any of the three of them. - But the plane to me was upside down. When it came in for the crash, the front when it hit the ground, to me it twisted and the front of the plane was upside down now and when it hit the tree it kind of bent. - The plane was split open on the side. I think that's where some of them got thrown out. There was a hand sticking out out of the crack. A bloody hand, I could see that and I could hear people moaning and saying get me out of here. - It was a lot of drumsticks and guitars and the girl's purse and everything laying around. - Everything in there, everything in the plane had blown, playing cards, just everything was covered pretty much in playing cards it seemed like and every playing card had blood on it. - I was the only person throwed out of the plane. Fortunately when I went through it, you could see these slashes across my hand. That's where I went through the fuselage, so there must've been just enough room to get through it, might've had a point right there for me to go through. And so I was jettisoned up under the right wing and I was the only person burnt by whatever it was, come to find out I'm a Navy pilot, it was phosphorous, a flare, those old planes didn't have no deicing equipment and they would pop flares to deice them planes in freezing conditions. So I'm there on that plane under that wing, in that wing was a flare that partially ignited and that's what melted my eye and melted, burnt my skin. Leather black, I had burnt holes all in me melting my eye, burnt a big hole in the side of my face. - I just climbed, somehow climbed up on the belly of the plane and when I did there was a crack and I stuck my finger in that crack, there was some dirt there and when I did I poked somebody in the eye and they were alive. So I told them close their eyes and I took that hatchet and I started working on that plane. - And then when they came to get us, the fuselage was broken in two above me and there was a piece of the fuselage that was coming down towards my face with somebody walking up there and I remember telling him be careful where you walk up there, there's people underneath you here because it looked like that jagged metal looked like it was coming towards my face and I couldn't move. - Then I was able to peel that fuselage back, shine that flashlight up in there and the first guy I saw, long hair, full beard and I was thinking what's and all, some of the rest of 'em saying what, the thought went through my head, what's a bunch of hippies doing on an airplane because back in those days the hippies we knew they were broke, they didn't have jobs or anything like that. - It was like a jigsaw puzzle. Some people, yes, you picked up, but some you had to move this chair or cut this seatbelt or do something to get people out. - Someone was kind of triaging and separating the injured and the dead. - And there was one guy in particular I was really concerned about. He was sitting there and he had his hand like this on his stomach and I could see blood just pouring out of his fingers, between his fingers and I'm thinking he's gonna die, bleed to death before we get him out. So it had been several hours and I came down off the plane and I walked out there and I see the guy laying there. I was angry about it, I said what are y'all doing, this guy's gonna die, let's get him out of here. So we grabbed the gurney and he was the first one we took across the creek. - And we started taking the injured out one by one and went across the creek and when we crossed, it had about 16, 18 inches of water in it and entering the creek wasn't that bad, but on the other side the bank was pretty steep and there were people, plenty of people on the other side helping to get the stretcher on up and there was some four wheel drive pickup trucks and they burse some hay and laid in the back of the pickup trucks to lay the injured in and take them across the field to where the ambulances wait. - They sandbagged me and took me out through the break in the fuselage and they laid us all on the ground and of course I couldn't really see anybody else and somebody came and laid beside me and I think they were pretty much doing that for a lot of people just to keep you warm because it was cold. It was October, Mississippi, in the swamp and then when they carried us out I was on a stretcher and I just remembered that it felt like I was gonna fall off the stretcher because they were having to carry us literally through the swamp and tripping I guess probably over who knows what trying to get us out of there and then when they got us to the ambulance I was actually in an ambulance with Leon and somebody else and I'm not sure who was on my left, I don't remember, but Leon was hurt real bad and he was starting to have convulsions and they were trying to get an IV in my arm and I remember telling 'em I'm okay, to get Leon. - As far as the crash, once I left Ronnie's side, that was it for me, I was out there and up under that engine and under that wing and nobody in the band or crew knew I was under there. Nobody knew it until I pulled out of there and Billy, they set him on the wing, 'cause his nose was cut real bad on the bridge of his nose. He was sitting there and he said you just crawled out from underneath him and reached at me and blood everywhere, you had a big hole in your head, big, black, bloody hole. He started pushing back then he would reach for me and he would try to say something and I'd push him back. I said why do you push me back for and he said because I thought you was gonna get a hold of my nose and pull my nose off. I said, well, I guess. - And of course the ones that were deceased were kind of set to the side and after things had calmed down we said it's time to get them out. - And then everybody, we got 'em all moved out and that's when I found out who they were, they were gone. - I saw this reporter coming, I recognized her, I see her on TV all the time. - They sent me back, you said you were the first one here and I said yes, sir. But then she was the one that told me who was on the plane and I was kind of ignorant. She said Lynyrd Skynyrd and I said which one was he and she said no, that's the name of the band and then when she refreshed my memory about Sweet Home Alabama, it kind of come to me, but that's when I found out, hours later. - That time I was small and I was the one that crawled up under it and got the briefcase and things and threw 'em out. A lot of people said there was a lot of money missing but it wasn't up under there. I saw a lot of checks and things but no cash. - We were just, I say country boys. We thought we was something, we thought we was going somewhere at that time, but whenever this happened, it just brought out who we are, it brought out the best of us. And none of us was trained in any type of first aid or rescue or anything like that. We just all jumped in and done what we felt like was natural. - There was a lot of people there helping, they went up in the plane but they were outside. They was up here on the highway. - And we took care of business that night and got back to our own lives. - I guess I had a lot of blood. My face was pretty cut up and they weren't sure if I was Cass or myself. And they came and asked us and it went out over the Biscuit Hour that I was a casualty. So that was what they announced so my family had to deal with that for a few hours before they found out that I was okay. But the first thing I remember is coming through the emergency doors and the last thing I remember is going back out 'em. Woke up a couple days later, I guess. - I was unconscious for at least a week and I remember waking up and going, looking up and saying where am I, what am I doing here? And then I looked at my arm and I went, how am I gonna work on guitars? And they go, you're not gonna have to worry about that for a while. All my ribs were broken and I had a punctured lung and a pretty massive concussion and a broken arm and a broken foot and some stick wounds where some tree things come in and stuck me in the arms and just I guess I ripped the floor out of the plane. I don't know, my feet were kind of weird, I don't know. - I woke up about a month later in the hospital under severe medication and stuff and in Mississippi I had a big hole in my head and it was burns, acid burns. I guess those hillbillies out there thought I wasn't gonna make it, I was brain dead. I was brain dead before the plane crashed. - And I remember Joe came and ran into my room hysterical telling me who had not made it and I think I passed out while she was there. I just wasn't ready to hear that. One day I just said well nobody would hurt any worse than me. And they said well, yeah and I said well, who? And they said well, Dead died and then Cassie and then Steve and then Ronnie and I went it was like somebody punched you, it's over. - I only started remembering things when they got me to Jacksonville, started doing the plastic surgery and stuff. I was coming down off of the, whatever narcotic they had me on because I started hallucinating because I was coming down off of it and then after that I could start, I remembered some things. I was asking about him. And said he's in the hospital. I was asking about Allen or whatever, you know, he's in Huntsville. He's home, he's out of the hospital, he's home. And I said where's Ronnie. He's home, he seemed to get out. So get out of the hospital and my girlfriend, Karen Gray at the time, I think it was just me and her. She was taking me to Ronnie's house, we were going the see Ronnie. And so go ahead and park out there, I'm expecting to go to his house, she pulls into the cemetery. And I said man, what are we going here for? She said, you're coming to visit Ronnie, he's right over there. That was rough. I didn't know he was dead at the time and he was in a temporary mausoleum. Temporary because Judy had ordered him a big, fancy mausoleum, it wasn't there yet. And he didn't have no name on it, it was just black. And it took me a while. 40 years actually. I couldn't believe it. And why nobody told me, she said because they didn't want to upset you in the hospital by letting you know it. It's tough to find out like that, you don't wanna find out your fishing buddy is dead and gone. It's still a shock after all these years but that's how I found out. - It just tore him up. It really did. I see how sad he is. They've always been real close. He's still real close to him and I could still see the sadness in him. He still has nightmares of that crash. - The last thing I remember was slapping Ronnie in the face and then hearing it smash the trees. And what's good about that is my voice was the last voice he heard. I think Ronnie's mistake was I'm 100% sure, I wake him up from a fog telling him the plane crashes, he's not knowing the plane's crashing and so I'm sure he unsnapped his belt because for him to be put in that position where he was at when he passed away at, he wasn't in the seat. When the plane hit and crushed so hard with that 15 tons of force, it twisted the couch that they were on up and Ronnie was jettisoned on top of that table. He laid underneath everybody. And he actually asphyxiated, he was knocked unconscious and never breathed again. - We had actually been on a separate policy as the Honkettes. I didn't even have insurance. We were being moved over to the band policies and things were being changed, being made more a permanent part. - Management had not paid my premium on the Honkettes policy so it had expired and I had a 90 day grace period with the band policy. So I had no insurance, I was told that I would be part of a class action suit against the management and then I was told it was conflict of interest, see ya. So as it all turned out I was even short on my social security. I had two quarters that never got turned in and we couldn't get any cooperation to even straighten that out. After the crash, bye bye. And it's been like that ever since. - After the crash we just kind of all separated 'cause it was over and I went up to Ohio to where my parents lived and recuperated there and I started getting phone calls like God, I still had a broken arm and Cheap Trick called me and wanted me to be their guitar tech and I'm going I'm still in shock! For a long time I was. And I'm like well, how many guitars do they have and the guy goes 28 and I went no thank you, you know. So then they called me and wanted to know this was in February, the crash was October. By February I'm living in New York City and I'm Foreigner's guitar tech for Double Vision. And then the year after that I was guitar tech for Journey for their world tour and I was still in shock. I was really just doing stuff on memory, as an alcoholic, I was a drug addict. When your body goes through that much trauma, I went through a lot of stuff, alcohol. - I don't regret not being able to be there. Gary came to me after the crash. I was still going through physical therapy, still wearing a brace part time. There was no way I could go back to work and I've never really been able to work. I went out with Molly Hatchet just a little bit, did a few big shoes with them but I just couldn't stay healthy. I haven't been able to stay healthy since the crash. - You live from your mistakes and go on but you can't look back. But the main thing would be, I'm the kind of person that thinks stick with it because I don't like to make mistakes, I don't like to do things wrong and seems like everything I've ever dones has been wrong. It's the Army, forget the Army and my marriage to my wife and my daughters. There's a divorce in 77, I whish that would've never happened. But Ronnie's loss, the loss of Ronnie. I will always hold me that against me until the day I die because I should've stopped that plane but I'm also, I can give orders or I can take orders and he was the pilot of the plane. He was responsible, he was the man that made the last decision, I know that. That's the last thing he ever heard. Him and his copilot. Don't you wish you was on the tarmac like I asked you to do. Three seconds later they were dead. - At the end of my thing with journey in 79, I called Gary and he goes hey, we're putting another band back together, you gonna come and be a part of it? And I go yeah, I'm on my way so I went down there and that's when they started the Rossington Collins band and then that lasted three years, I think, and then Allen and Gary had a little misunderstanding and Gary took off for Wyoming and Allen started the Allen Collins Band. And I was pretty much the key guy for that one, me and Mike Sparks kind of ran that kind of thing. And I went along with Sparks and Collins we had an office over on Jacobs where we had the old rehearsal place and Allen was pretty out of it, he was really bad on drugs and alcohol and stuff so it didn't last long. - You can't be prepared too young. Watch what you sign and make sure you take care of your business. I don't think it was personal. I got told it's not personal, it's business but just the same a lot of things got shut out and we haven't really been treated well since the crash and I think that was more hurtful than anything else. It was the fact that you thought people were your friends that weren't. That people that had been together and gone through something like that together couldn't pull it together to be right to everybody and treat each other like friends when you thought they were until the old mighty dollar pops up and then you're not. Things that weren't done that Ronnie would not have put up with had he known. But that's life. - I'm 66, and I just kind of grew up here in the last year maybe. And I said boy, you're getting old and I come to the rationalization, no you are old and you've been old. All your friends are dying or I'm pretty healthy I don't take any prescription medication, and I quit drinking and before it effected me. I'm just lucky I got good genes, you know, because I really used this body up, man. Seriously. I drank enough whiskey to float a battle ship around. - And I'm having trouble sleeping and everything. And I'd be up in the morning or whatever, I couldn't sleep, been up all night. I'd hear this. It irritate me, I was trying to sleep and I was really irritated. I kept hearing it. I got up went around, looked everywhere, I thought it might be the refrigerator one time or it might be the air conditioner, it might be something else. I kept. One morning I was. I'm fixing to throw something out here and I happened to look out the window and there was an air conditioner there and a mockingbird looked right at me and that mockingbird was pecking on that window and I walked up there and I looked right in between. Is that you? I says, I bet it's you. I'm alright and flew off. Never came back. As long as I stayed there that bird never came back. ♪ It was 12,000 feet when I fell down from the sky ♪ ♪ As of this day I still don't know why ♪ ♪ Sometimes I question my maker's decision ♪ ♪ What is in this life might just be an illusion ♪ ♪ Well yeah ♪ On a cold dark Mississippi night ♪ ♪ Angels come holding the glow in the light ♪ ♪ They took some, they left others behind ♪ ♪ Without this life it was their chosen time ♪ - Wow, gosh it's been so long. People ask me if it's hard to talk about but it's been 40 years so it's really not hard to talk about anymore. It's just kind of good to see these guys alive. There's not many of us left. I was telling them about when we played cards and you never drank or smoked no pot or nothing when we would be playing cards and I'd be smoking pot, we'd all be smoking pot and you would get a contact high. He'd start cussing at us, damn potheads, I can't even think! He'd have to get up and leave the table. - It broke my attention because the pot smoke would be like thunder clouds and what'd you say, if it's not worth remembering it's not worth writing down or something like that, didn't he say that? - He said it, yeah. It was something like if it's not good enough to remember it's not worth remembering, I don't know, something like that. - If it's not good enough to remember. Something, yeah. - I remember that one though. - He always had all the parts in his head. - He could write, I mean, you give him a topic, I think he could write about anything. He'd just think about something real simple and just write about it. Just give him a topic, that's kind of hard to do. - Well he considered himself a storyteller. He never thought of himself first as a singer, but a storyteller, a communicator. - He fed off of people, what they said, the truck driver that was always going, little Jim said, you got that shit right. And say you got that right, that's where that song come from. - Minnesota truck driver. - Yeah.
