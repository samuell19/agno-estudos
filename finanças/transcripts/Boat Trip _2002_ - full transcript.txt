[ Chuckling ] Okay, everyone. Change partners. Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha. We meet again. I hope that's your belt buckle I feel back there. You know, from the moment we met, I felt... there was an electrical charge between us. I think your pacemaker's shortin' out. How did you know I like to be humiliated? Look, Lloyd, you're barking up the wrong tree here. Oh, I know! You want to lead. Lloyd, I'm not... interested. That's all right. I'm a patient man. I can wait. I'm also very rich. You know, I'd like to spoil you, Nick, take you places you've never been, show you things you've never seen. I'd like to-- [ Whispering ] Jerry! Cha-cha-cha. That's it. You're a really good dance teacher. Really? Yes. It's fun to teach a class like this. I always felt too self-conscious to really... cut loose, you know? We have our review here on board. It's like an amateur night thing. Think you'll be interested? Too public. I'm more of a closet dancer. That's a shame because I'm the choreographer. Really? Mm-hmm. Well, for you I might just waltz out of the closet. You know, it's strange. What's that? The way you stare at me sometimes... or the way you touch me, like that right now, is exactly the way a straight guy would. Me? Straight? [ Laughs ] Girlfriend, please. Whoo! Nobody's gotta teach me how to be gay. Bette Midler is also known... as the Divine Miss-- "M"? Ah, very good! Very good. Oh, sorry. Okay, now describe the Brandy Alexander you're drinking.

Oh, you mean the storm. That I do not know. [ Thunderclap ] Whoo! Let me ask you something. How many cruises have you been on? Including this one? That would make it... one. You see, I only recently come all the way out of the closet. Recently? Really? Mmm. - I would figure kindergarten. - No, but let me tell you, it wasn't easy. But it's better to be true to yourself than to lie to the world. Must have taken a lot of guts. It's funny, you know. These guys I'm playing poker with-- Steven, Tom, Ron. Steven's a doctor. A gay heart surgeon. Who would have thought? Ron's a criminal defense attorney. He represents badass dudes. Tom's a cross-dressing pastry chef. Okay, I would have guessed that, but still... they're a great bunch of guys. So what are you saying? What am I saying? What I'm saying is, I kind of wanted to hang out more with these guys, but there was a part of me that felt it was somehow... wrong to be friends with gay men. And that... makes me feel like a jerk. Sit. Come on. Sit. [ Sighs ] You know, my papa, he used to think that to be gay was muy malo, a big shame. He no talk to me for 20 years, his own blood. Then when he's sick, he's dying, h-he ask for me, he say to me, "Hector, "I waste so much time. "We all God's children. I'm so sorry." He said, he's sorry. Ooh. Uh-- You see, my papi, he like you. He no jerk. He just need to learn. You learn too, my friend. [ Door Closes ] [ Jerry, Gabriella Laughing ] Ohh! Ow, I'm hurting. [ Thunderclap ] Oh, it feels so good to get off my feet! Ohh! I couldn't agree with you more. You know what? I've got to get out of these clothes. I couldn't agree with you more. Listen, would you mind doing me a huge, huge favor? Would you spend the night with me? What? Yeah, you know, it's the storm. I wouldn't mind huddling under the covers with somebody. You think Nick would mind? Oh-- Fuck Nick. [ Thunderclap ] Is this storm gettin' worse... or am I too drunker? I have a theory. I think if we drank more, we might be able to maintain perfect equilibrium. I'll try that... in the pursuit of... science. I'll get us another round. I have a better idea. I have a 50-year-old bottle of cognac... in my room, and I'm gonna go get it. I'll go with you. I could use the exercise. All right. [ Gabriella ] Jerry. We can get up from under the covers. I think the storm was over like half an hour ago. That's one hell of a storm, though. You know what? I have something you're gonna love! Mmm! Get ready to have an orgasm. What? Open wide. Mmm. Good? - Mm-hmm. - [ Moans, Sighs ] - Do me. - You're so lucky I'm gay. Oh! Mmm! [ Moaning ] - Can I ask you something? - Shoot. - How do you do it? - Do what? - Give head. - What? A blow job. I mean, do you start on the tip of his penis? Do you stroke it while you use your mouth? Do you tickle the balls? Not everybody likes that. As a person who gives them and receives them, you must know the perfect way. Show me. Oh! Uh-- What? Uh-- Okay. A-- Um-- [Chuckles] What? Eh-- You-- Nothing smaller then? You know, I got an idea. Why don't you show me your technique, and then I'll critique it? Okay. Okay. Yeah. So look. First, I slowly lick the tip with my tongue, right? Uh-huh. [ Moans ] - Right? - That's good. Then I gently go down the shaft with my lips. [ Kissing ] And at the same time, I tickle the balls very softly. Then I trill my tongue all the way... [ Moans ] back to the top. Then I wet my lips, [ Moans ] I do a little playful nibbling... and then I slip in my mouth. [ Speaks Spanish ] [ Spanish ] How's that? - Jerry? - That's fine! [ Foghorn Bellows ] For goodness sake, Lloyd, at least kiss me first. [ Laughing ] No, you didn't. Oh, yes, I did. Oh, now where did I put that bag? I'm just gonna lay down. [ Snores ] [ Groans ] Got it. [ Snoring ] Now, before we go back up with the boys, what do you say we do a couple of shots? [ Giggling ] You're a goddamn genius. Here you go. Oh. [ Scoffs ] [ Snoring ] [ Moans ] [ Screaming ] Oh, my... God! Gosh! What are you doing? I have a horrible taste in my mouth, and I can't get rid of it. What, did you eat something weird? Yeah. Oh-- I did a bad, bad thing, Jerry. What? You know how the sea air makes you disoriented, and I was blitzed from the drinking and the partying, and I-I-- I slept with a man, Jerry. Very funny. No, it's not. I just woke up in Ron's state room... with Ron. What? I've chased a lot of women, Jerry. But to be honest, I've never actually scored with one since I was a senior in high school, and then I had to promise to marry her. A 51-year-old coffee shop waitress... and stroke victim... with a fake leg... and a lazy eye... and a mole with teeth-- I-I got it. What I'm trying to say is, maybe I'm meant to do more than just play cards with these guys, Jerry. [ Scoffs ] I'm finally happy. I'm so happy. I'm gay. [ Gabriella ] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight-- And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Good. Good work, guys. Good work. Hector, try not shaking your ass so much. You mean in the dance or in real life? Okay, guys, thank you so much for coming. I'll see you back here tonight at 11:00. Jerry, you are looking fierce up there. Oh-- [ Laughing ] I can't remember when I've had this much fun. You know, you are just great. Hey, are you gonna go to the island? I am. Do you want me to be your tour guide? I know the island very well. That would be yummy. Yummy? Uh, let's go. Nicholas, I was beginning to wonder about you. I'm glad to see that you finally got that luscious, full-figured frame of yours in the right dinghy. It's amazing. A day ago I would have seriously thought about... punching you in the face for saying something like that. This place is paradise. Oh, yeah. We're gonna have an awesome time. I'll say. I can already feel the men around here undressing me with their eyes. You hungry? You want to get something to eat? Nope. I have a better idea. Let's go exploring first. Great. Daddy, thanks so much for finding out where Jerry is for me. Yeah, I'm sure things are gonna work out too. Bye-bye. Love you, Daddy. How do I get to the Olympia Voyager? Right this way, madam. Be careful with those bags. They're worth more than you make in a year. [Chuckling] Have a nice trip. Bitch. Hey, Nick. How ya doin'? Hey, fine. I'm not sore or anything. Hey, buddy, about last night, I understand why it happened. I mean, uh, I'm pretty charismatic, and if the moon hits me in just the right way, I can look pretty damn tasty. You know, you're okay too, but, uh, I'd just really rather we stay friends. All right. Me too, Nick. Yeah? Wow. Yeah. If I would have said that to a chick, she'd be a total mess right now. I'm starting to see the upside to this whole thing. [ Marching Approaching ] If you do what Sonya says-- one, two, three, four. Woke up with no tanning cream, now you're off the tanning team. One, two, three, four-- Coach, look, it's the Hawaiian Tropic team. [ Swedish ] [ Man ] Hey, break it up, ladies. Come on. Move. Come on. Take it easy. [ Whistles ] Break it up. Break it up. Save it for the tanning competition. Bad! You are bad! Everybody move out now! Okay, girls, get your heinies on the donkeys... now! Nick? I just wanted to say good-bye. I'm going to the airport now. Inga, it was great almost knowing you. Nick, if you're ever near Gettzemüllersteigen, Sweden, I would love to see you again. I don't think so, baby. I don't think this is gonna work out. But I thought you liked me, Nick. I'm confused. [ Sighs ] So am I. You don't even know. You better hurry. You have an ass to catch. [ Sniffling ] And you? Huh. Hey. [ Sonya ] And we go. Oh, that feels good. Hey, Nick. About last night, you don't think anything happened, do you? What do you think happened? Nothing. You and I drank too much and then fell asleep. Are you sure? Yeah. No! [Cackling] None! Well, I think we lost that one forever. A lot of potential in that boy. Could have been one of the great ones. I saw in him what I saw in Elton John. Mmm. What do you think? That is so great. - But I'm not nearly that pretty. - You are to me. You know, you are so talented, Jerry. You think so? Wow. Absolutely. [ Snickers ] Why the funny look? Oh, nothing. It's-- No one's ever encouraged my drawing before. Well, that's crazy, because you're wonderful. Let's go take a walk on the beach. Come on. Oh, it's so rocky.

What were you thinking about when we were making love-- cabana boys? Hey, hey-- I am not gay. And to think, I wanted to be your wife! What? I really missed you, Jerry. All the special times we had-- we complimented each other. We could have built a life together. Built a life together? Yes. Well, what about Andre, the buffer boy? It was just a fling. Oh-- A horrible, thoughtless, insensitive mistake. Eh-- But he showed me what I really wanted-- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. A stable, decent man who will always be there for me. And I thought that that was you. [ Sighs ] What are you saying? You want to get back together? Well, I did... before I found out that you were gay. How could you think I'm gay? You're standing there preening like a gay peacock, and you don't want me to think you're tutti-frutti? For heaven's sake, Felicia! I am not gay, and I never have been gay. Then why the hell are you on this boat? Nick-- Nick and I got on this cruise by mistake. And then I met this girl and she assumed I was gay. And then I stupidly went along with it because-- She's behind me, isn't she? [ Sighs ] [ Groans ] How could you? Gabriella, I'm sorry. - I tried to tell you. - You're an asshole, Jerry. [ Sighs ] I-- Ow! [ Squeals ] [ Felicia ] Oh, oh-- Oh! Oh, oh. Not again! Oh. That was the girl I was talking about. Well, looks like you had a dumb fling yourself. I tell you what, if you can forgive me, I can certainly forgive you. And we can get married just like you always wanted, Jerry. Oh, I love you, baby. What do you say? [ Man ] Great. Now one of the bride and groom... staring at each other lovingly. You look so beautiful. Thank you. Why don't we both look beautiful? [ Whispering ] Take out that earring. Felicia, may I borrow Jerry for a moment? Of course, Daddy. Jerry, uh, before I walk my baby girl down the aisle, tell it to me straight. Was this little high-seas adventure of yours really an accident? Oh, yes, sir. Definitely an accident. Good. Good. Mm-hmm. Now remember, report to work the Monday after the honeymoon... at 6:00 a.m. sharp. Yes, sir. A man with your imagination... is really gonna love managing a muffler shop. Oh, I'm sure I will, sir. Mm-hmm. [ Jerry ] Felicia is good for me. She planned this entire wedding all by herself. Got me a great job with her father, got us a new apartment, picked out all the linens and plates, and as our wedding gift, she gave me an entire new wardrobe. Hmm. Yep, the only decision I have left to make for the rest of my life... is whether I want to be buried or cremated. No, no, I take that back-- We're being buried side by side. She told me this morning. Hey, Jerry, I'm sorry I'm late. I had a little bit of a personal crisis this morning. Is everything all right, Pastor? Oh, fine. Fine. Just, uh, had a few personal issues I had to clarify, but-- Hey, it's your big day. Nothing's gonna spoil it. Glad to see you finally made it, Reverend. I've got a string quartet back at the Hyatt about to go into golden time. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. Friends of yours? Yes, sir. I met them on the cruise. Oh. So you accidentally hopped aboard the Guy-tanic too, huh? How's it goin'? I guess not. Jerry, I'm gonna keep my eye on you. What's up, guys? Hey, come here. It's important. You're not gonna believe this. [ No Audible Dialogue ] There is no more sacred contract than the bond of marriage... and no more spiritual union... than that between a man and a woman. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today... to bring this man and this woman... together in the eyes of-- In the eyes of, uh-- - God? - God. Yeah, yeah. That's what you say. No, that's what you say. Yeah, yeah. Well, I used to until recently. I mean, uh, if there really was a God, would he allow my wife to run off with a contractor... who overcharged me for a bay window? But that's my problem. That's my problem. I'm sorry. It's your day. Where was I? Um, a happy marriage is the perfect human relationship, a setting in which each partner feels free... to be as he or she is under God's bountiful nature. That same nature that allowed the number-five horse at Pimlico... - to screw me in a photo finish. - [ Clears Throat ] I'm sorry. Where was I? Ah, yeah, yeah. Um-- Oh-- So if there is anyone present who feels there's a reason... that these two people should not be joined together in holy matrimony, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. [ Minister ] Okay, fine. Jerry, then, if there is no objection, turn to Felicia and repeat after me. I, Jerry, take you Felicia... to be my lawful wedded-- Stop. Wait, wait! [ Nick ] Time out! Time out! Nick, what are you doing? I have to say something. If I didn't speak now, I could never live with myself. A couple weeks ago, Jerry and I took a cruise together. It wasn't the cruise we intended to take, but... it was a good thing we got on the wrong boat, because... it changed our lives forever. Jerry, if you marry Felicia today, it will end up in disaster. You need to be with the person you fell in love with on that boat. And I know it, because that person... is me. Hmm? Oh, oh! [ Screams ] How much of that pot did you smoke? I know where Gabriella is. If we hurry, we can catch her. Jerry, what the hell is wrong with you? You can't humiliate me like this in front of my family and my friends! My dad is gonna kill you!

You're about to be united with the woman you love. What do you think? Oh-- Why don't you calm down? You are in very, very good hands. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I know you only think of me... as a hard-partying old queen, but for your information, I spent 32 years... in the armed forces... serving Her Majesty, the real queen. I've seen action in five different theaters of war. I've made over 490 drops, 23 over hostile territory. I am what you colonials might call... a bad-assed motherfucker, who also happens to be an expert... in the delicate art of Japanese flower arranging. Oh. Over the target, Captain. Right. It's now or never. Eh-- Aaah! Come on, Jerry, get off here. Jump out! [ Jerry ] I can't do this! [ Nick ] Go get her, Jerry! This is a really bad idea! [ Jerry Screaming ] Wait! I'm gonna be sick. I mean it. Oh! Oh, I felt that one. [ Lloyd ] Good Lord, you're a crybaby! [ Gabriella's Voice ] Five, six, seven, eight. Kick back, head up, down. One more time. Kick back, head up, down. I want it sassy now. Come on. Kick, plié. [ Jerry Shouting, Indistinct ] Head up, down. And kick, plié. [ Jerry Shouting ] I'm not a person who likes heights! Oh, I don't feel so good. I don't feel so good. Oh, I hate this! [ Screaming ] - What is that? - [ Jerry ] I don't like this! [ Lloyd ] We're over target. Prepare for release. Release! Aaah! Ha-ha! Oh, we did it! [ Laughing ] I'm so excited! If truth be told, I'm more than a little excited myself. Oh-- Unhook me, please. I don't believe this. - Help, please. - This time I'm gonna let you drown. Well, you're gonna have to drag me over to the deep end, 'cause it's only about three-and-a-half feet over here. - What are you doing here? - I was in the neighborhood, so I figured, well, I'd just drop in. Good-bye. Uh, Gabriella, wait! Please. Mm-hmm? I thought I was being reasonably clever... considering I just dropped 1,500 feet out of an airplane. Why'd you bother? Because I love you. Who loves me-- gay Jerry as a friend, or is this straight, lying, deceitful Jerry? Hmm? You've never met this Jerry. This is the extremely sorry, unbelievably heartbroken because you left me, will do anything to get you to forgive me... because I want to spend the rest of my life with you Jerry. Well, you listen to me, Jerry. Just because you dropped out of the sky... and made this grand romantic gesture... doesn't mean that I'm gonna automatically run into your arms. Do you understand that? Hmm? Yes. Good. Okay. I'm probably going to, but you shouldn't automatically expect it. Because if we're gonna have the kind of relationship... where one day you're gonna be making all these hurtful fantasies-- Don't you ever, ever... lie to me again. I swear. I'll never understand it. Neither will I. [ Nick, Echoing ] Inga! No. No. No. [ Knocking ] My God. Oh, my God! I'm Nick Ragoni. I'm a friend of your daughter Inga. I've traveled 12,000 miles to surprise her. You poor thing. You look frozen. Let me help you up. [ Groaning ] Let me and my son help you up. Johan, come over here. Ja. Oh-- Come on. This man is obviously a fan of smörgåsbord. Ingmar, what's going on? Oh, Mother, he's an American friend of Inga's. Oh, I hope you didn't go too much trouble to get here. - Inga's not home. - What? She's gone to Italy on a modeling assignment. - Won't be back for three months. - Oh, God, no. - I can't believe it. - You poor boy. You look so cold. You'll join us for dinner. Bridgit, get this man some soup from the stove. This is Bridgit. She wants to be a bikini model, just like her big sister. Nice to meet you. And Bridgit's coach will be joining us for dinner too. [ Woman Gasps ] Oh-- Oh, Nicholas. Hello. We meet again.
