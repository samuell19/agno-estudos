Good? We got a letter from Nadim. ﻿I'll read it to you. ﻿"Hello everyone ﻿"I am writing to you from France. ﻿"I miss you all. ﻿"God willing, we will come this summer ﻿"with the baby ﻿"and stay with you forever. ﻿"Without you, our happiness^ is incomplete. ﻿"I miss our sea "and the smell of the orange groves" ﻿The Jews have entered Jaffa! ﻿The Jews are in Jaffa! ﻿Well be back on Friday. ﻿They say we can come back on Friday. Lets go. ﻿Everyone is leaving now. ﻿Go on. ﻿Come on. ﻿Come Grandpa. ﻿Yes. ﻿It's... ﻿The entire top is torn. ﻿Strange... ﻿Very interesting. ﻿What? ﻿It's as if you're not touching the ground. ﻿You're hovering in the air. ﻿Are you a bird? ﻿If wish I was a bird ﻿singing all day without any worries. ﻿And without any thoughts. ﻿Look what he gave us, the ability to think. ﻿Of all creatures he only gave it to us. ﻿I would rather be a bird. ﻿Not knowing the end. ﻿There is no end. ﻿Everything returns. ﻿When you look at it, it's better than an x-ray. ﻿The whole person is in here. ﻿This shoe for example... ﻿This woman is tramping in the soil. ﻿Every month I make a new heel for her. ﻿but she doesn't despair and never gives up. ﻿she's always searching. ﻿Searching for what? ﻿What we're all searching for. ﻿I once met a woman like that. ﻿They always say that all women are pretty ﻿but this one was beautiful. ﻿I loved her. ﻿But she wanted an educated man. ﻿Later she regretted it ﻿but it was too late. ﻿Why too late? ﻿got married. ﻿My wife was pregnant. ﻿You know her, Victoria. ﻿What a woman... ﻿Who? ﻿Victoria. ﻿What a heart she has. ﻿And what a choulent she cooks. ﻿Three kinds of meat and four kinds of fat. ﻿Dad is coming. ﻿Gideon, come home. ﻿In a minute. ﻿Not in a minute. Now. ﻿Nahum, the shutter isn't opening. ﻿Maybe you can do something. ﻿Here. ﻿It's hard without a man in the house. ﻿I can't handle these things. ﻿When is he coming back? ﻿He was supposed to be released in a month ﻿but last week that idiot tried to escape. ﻿Now, who knows how long it'll take. ﻿That's it. It's fixed. ﻿I asked Nahum to fix the shutter. ﻿Thanks, Nahum. ﻿Tammy, Finish your milk and go to bed. ﻿Just a moment. Tammy. ﻿Give it to Dad, and don't bother him. I'm not bothering you, am I? ﻿Why are you laughing? ﻿You have eyes like a tiger. ﻿I'm afraid of tigers. ﻿Don't be afraid. Fear is just a word. ﻿We can drive it away in a second. ﻿How? - We’ll change the word. ﻿Instead of "f e a r" ﻿we'll write down "d r i v e", "drive". ﻿What's drive? ﻿Drive is what motivates us. ﻿What inspires us to do things. ﻿To create. ﻿Like God? We are sparks of God. ﻿Tammy, there's school tomorrow. ﻿I'm not going to school. ﻿How come? ﻿I have to take care of Daddy. ﻿Why do you have to take care of him? ﻿Because of what the other kids said. ﻿What did they say? ﻿That Daddy almost died. ﻿Daddy didn't almost die. ﻿Daddy died. ﻿There is no Daddy. ﻿Here, Gita, it's here. ﻿Edith, Naomi, come. ﻿Hello Devorah. - Hello, how are you? ﻿You've grown so much! ﻿Come, I'll show you the room. ﻿Ruti! ﻿We're lucky that the tenants left for the holiday ﻿so we can celebrate Passover together. ﻿Okay. ﻿You have a light here. ﻿A little something for the holiday. ﻿You really didn't have to. ﻿Go to her. ﻿Thank you. ﻿It's beautiful. ﻿Sorry, But... ﻿I just don't... ﻿play with dolls anymore. ﻿Make yourselves at home. ﻿We'll meet later at lunch. ﻿Ruti! ﻿What? - Come on. ﻿I want to stay. ﻿Not now. Come on. ﻿Let her stay. ﻿Will we all sleep in one bed? ﻿We'll manage. ﻿What happened? ﻿I suddenly didn't know where I was. ﻿You're here. We're all here. ﻿Everything's fine. ﻿Why are you far away from me? ﻿I'm not far away. I'm here. ﻿Come closer. ﻿Hold me. ﻿Not in front of the children. ﻿Why not? Are we stealing something? ﻿Enough, go to sleep. ﻿Hold me. ﻿Gita... ﻿We're not at home. The children could wake up. ﻿Tighter. Mom, ﻿I'm hungry. ﻿Shh... ﻿Can God see that I'm eating? ﻿I want to drink. ﻿You can't right now. ﻿She can go to the bathroom and drink some water. ﻿That skirt again? ﻿Didn't you buy a new dress? ﻿How do you expect to find someone? ﻿You have to get married. ﻿I want someone whom I'll love. ﻿Marry whoever's there. ﻿You want to end up an old maid? ﻿If you don't love him, get divorced. ﻿It's better to be divorced. ﻿Nobody wants an old maid. ﻿Come, Ruti. ﻿They haven't opened the post office yet? ﻿No. ﻿It's supposed to open at 7:30 ﻿but nobody comes on time except me. ﻿I told them I could open up ﻿but they wouldn't give me the key. ﻿Do they think I'll steal stamps? ﻿I don't even write letters ﻿except for to my Father in America but... ﻿He never answers me. ﻿I ask him to come back and he never responds. ﻿Sometimes I think something's happened to him. ﻿I don't understand why he left us. ﻿I wasn't even born when he went away ﻿but he left my Mother ﻿although she was pregnant. ﻿Did he know? ﻿Of course he knew. ﻿He saw her belly. ﻿He wasn't blind. ﻿So? ﻿Don't rush me. ﻿Do you see anyone? ﻿Slowly, slowly. ﻿Ashkenazi or Sepharadi? ﻿With glasses? ﻿There are excellent people with glasses. ﻿But I want someone without glasses. ﻿Is he rich? ﻿When will he come? ﻿That's up to him. ﻿Where is he? ﻿If wish I knew. ﻿What's he doing now? ﻿Now? ﻿He's eating. ﻿Now?! ﻿Yes. ﻿It's lunchtime. ﻿Where have you been? ﻿I went to buy fish. ﻿Fish, In the middle of the week? ﻿The child asked for it. ﻿And what's this? ﻿From Haim, the flower seller. ﻿What? ﻿What do you mean Haim.. ﻿No, no... ﻿No, don't start. You promised me. ﻿You promised me. - I know. ﻿Look what you're doing to the child. ﻿Look what you're doing. ﻿What am I doing to the child? ﻿You promised me. ﻿You promised me. - I know. ﻿You promised. ﻿You promised. - What am I doing to the child? ﻿Enough... Enough... ﻿If you ever ﻿go to buy fish without me again ﻿I'll kill you. ﻿I'll kill you. ﻿Where are you going? - Downstairs. ﻿You're not going anywhere. ﻿Do you hear me? ﻿I'll tell your father. ﻿I don't have a father. ﻿Shut your mouth. We got a postcard from Dad. ﻿When is he coming? ﻿He’s not coming. ﻿Not even to my wedding? ﻿Find someone first. ﻿One day the boy came home from school ﻿and there was nobody home. ﻿Mom... Mom.. ﻿Mom, let me in. ﻿Don't you dare. ﻿Mom... Open up... ﻿Mom... ﻿That'll teach her. ﻿Open up... ﻿Why doesn't her Mother let her in? ﻿Eventually she will. ﻿Go on. ﻿The boy didn't find anyone... ﻿Right. ﻿So he decided to go to his Grandmother's ﻿who lived behind the train station. ﻿When he got near the station ﻿he heard a loud noise and screams. ﻿He saw soldiers pushing people ﻿into the train cars yelling ﻿"Hurry up, "the train has to leave." ﻿Suddenly, someone grabbed his shirt ﻿and pushed him into the train ﻿and the train left. ﻿Where to? ﻿Inside the train ﻿there was no air. ﻿People fell asleep standing up and fell on top of one another. ﻿The boy was hungry. ﻿He thought how his father and mother ﻿will come home and wouldn't know where he was. ﻿He craved for the fried potatoes with onions ﻿that his mother used to cook. ﻿Then he fell asleep. ﻿When he woke up ﻿all that he saw was the sky. ﻿The ground was wet. ﻿He felt something heavy on his legs. ﻿It was a woman. ﻿I tried to push her off of me but I couldn't. ﻿Then I saw many people lying around me ﻿covered with blood and no one was moving. ﻿Nahum, come to bed. ﻿Do you want some tea? ﻿You're beautiful. ﻿You never tell me that I'm beautiful. ﻿Why... ﻿Dad, who are you talking to? ﻿To you. ﻿What are you saying? ﻿I'm telling you a story. ﻿I can't hear. ﻿At the edge of the world there is a mountain. ﻿And on the mountain there's a rock ﻿and from the rock flows a spring. ﻿On the other side of the world there's the heart of the world ﻿that longs for the spring and wants to reach it. ﻿The world has a heart? ﻿Yes. ﻿Like every living thing. ﻿The heart of the world yearns for the spring and wants to reach it ﻿and calls out with a great cry. ﻿And the spring yearns for the heart too. ﻿When the heart of the world gets tired of screaming ﻿and of the heat of the sun ﻿a giant bird comes ﻿spreads its wings to shade it ﻿and it rests. ﻿the heart continues to look at the spring ﻿and long for it. ﻿So why doesn't it go to it? ﻿Because if it gets close to the mountain ﻿it won't be able to see the rock and the spring. ﻿And if it can't see the spring it won't yearn for it anymore. ﻿And if it doesn't yearn for it ﻿it'll die. ﻿But... We always yearn for someone we don't see ﻿and not for someone we do. ﻿The point is to see with your heart, Tammy. ﻿To love. ﻿Without love we can't live. ﻿Does everyone love? ﻿No. ﻿So how can they live? ﻿Give it to me. ﻿Is she ready? - Yes ﻿Come sweetheart. - Go dearie, go. ﻿No, Mom. No... ﻿Come on, ﻿maybe I can save you. ﻿No Mom. - Hurry, hurry. ﻿Go dearie. - Hurry, come with me. ﻿Where's Gideon? ﻿Gideon! ﻿Gideon! ﻿Gideon! ﻿Gi... Gideon! ﻿Gideon... ﻿Not now, Betty. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿I'm cleaning. ﻿Aharon, it's Saturday morning. You'll wake up the children. ﻿Beethoven must be played loud. ﻿If you had studied philosophy we would have some quiet. ﻿Yes, philosophy. Yes. ﻿Instead of being a music teacher. ﻿A frustrated teacher of mediocre students ﻿without any inspiration or ambition. ﻿I could have been a conductor. ﻿I could have been a conductor. Do you understand? ﻿I could have been a conductor. - I know. ﻿I could have been a conductor. ﻿Aharon... ﻿Aharon... ﻿Stop it. You're going crazy. ﻿Not anymore. My entire life I was crazy. ﻿Now I'm finally getting better. ﻿I'm getting better every day. ﻿The children... The children. ﻿Oh, Gita, you're wonderful. ﻿Wonderful. Wonderful. ﻿Your mother is wonderful. Wonderful! ﻿Good night. ﻿Good night, Naomi. ﻿Good night. ﻿Aharon... ﻿Aharon! ﻿She fell asleep. - I'll put her to bed. ﻿Tomorrow is your birthday. ﻿I remember like it was today. ﻿I walked in the snow ﻿40 degrees below zero. ﻿Monik walked alongside me, leaning on me. ﻿I told him "maybe Gita gave birth already." ﻿I didn't know if you were born or not. ﻿Aharon... ﻿It wasn't her who was born then. ﻿So who was it? ﻿Another girl. ﻿Why? ﻿Why don't you answer me? - I told you, no. ﻿I'm leaving. ﻿I don't understand. ﻿What are we going to tell Assaf? ﻿The truth. ﻿That we're breaking up. ﻿But he'll want to know why. ﻿So we'll tell him. ﻿But I don't know what to tell him. ﻿He's a big boy. ﻿He knows that couples break up. ﻿But why? why? ﻿I want to know why. I deserve to know why! ﻿I feel like some ice cream. ﻿You want me to bring you some? - No. ﻿I'll bring you some. - No. ﻿When did this all happen? ﻿Where was I? ﻿You were painting. ﻿I can't think of us not together. ﻿And what about Assaf? ﻿Assaf is already a soldier. ﻿But he needs parents. ﻿He has parents, ﻿no one's taking them away from him. ﻿But you're leaving. ﻿Yes, but I'm not dying. ﻿I'll go on living somewhere else. ﻿Where? ﻿Do you have someone? ﻿No. ﻿Where will you live? ﻿I don't know. ﻿We have to figure things out. ﻿What things? ﻿The apartment. ﻿What about the apartment? ﻿We'll have to sell it. ﻿What?! ﻿I's my home. ﻿It's the only place I have in the world. ﻿I'm not going anywhere. ﻿You can kill me if you want but I'm not leaving. ﻿I haven't seen you for weeks. ﻿I was here three days ago. ﻿Well, for three days I've been waiting to hear from you. ﻿I made the eggplant salad you love and you didn't come. ﻿I made the stuffed peppers you love... ﻿Who do you think I make it all for? ﻿For you and Dad. ﻿Dad, right... ﻿He can't say a good word about anything. ﻿But he eats up everything you make him. ﻿He could have left some for you, that egoist. ﻿I barely managed to save this. ﻿Let him eat for good health. ﻿What's new? ﻿Edith and I are breaking up. ﻿Are you crazy? ﻿What happened? ﻿it'll break his heart. ﻿Where was he? ﻿At the clinic. ﻿Is he sick? ﻿Does he have to be sick ﻿Then what does he do there? ﻿He visits the nurse ﻿Is she nice? ﻿What a surprise. ﻿Did you come to eat eggplant? ﻿No, Mom forced it on me. ﻿Eat it for good health. ﻿What's new? ﻿Everything's fine. ﻿What's fine? ﻿Everything. ﻿Where's the newspaper? ﻿It's where you left it. ﻿Where did I leave it? ﻿Look for it. I don't know. ﻿It's like that everyday. I don't even touch the paper. ﻿You don't read the paper? ﻿Why should I read it, is it such great literature? ﻿So what's new? ﻿Today. ﻿through the same day twice. ﻿Some philosopher said that. ﻿He was talking about water. ﻿We have to conserve water. ﻿Mom doesn't understand that. ﻿She soaps up the dishes with the faucet running. ﻿To each his own. I see you're on her side. ﻿I wish he was on my side. ﻿No one's on my side. ﻿I'm not on your side, Riva? ﻿How is that helping me? - Stop fighting. ﻿You should see us when we really fight. ﻿I don't want to. ﻿You should know something about your parents. ﻿What I know is enough. ﻿Maybe we'll see you more often now? ﻿So, what's new? ﻿Do you think we'll be able to live differently? ﻿I don't understand the question. ﻿That it'll be surprising and new. ﻿Do you think something new can happen between us? ﻿It depends. ﻿On what? ﻿I don't know. I haven't thought about it. ﻿So think. ﻿It's different. ﻿What's different? ﻿To begin a new life after it all. ﻿After what? ﻿After having lived a whole life. ﻿So you're not sure that you want to begin again? ﻿Something like that. ﻿You don't have the strength... ﻿Something like that. ﻿You talked differently two days ago. ﻿What's changed since then? ﻿You came to live here. ﻿You wanted it. ﻿I know. ﻿Many things I've done in life turned out to be mistakes. ﻿So you think this is a mistake too? ﻿Maybe. ﻿At least you're catching it in time. ﻿Almost. ﻿Why almost? ﻿You're already here. ﻿I can go. I haven't unpacked yet. ﻿Yeah, but it's a shame. ﻿What's a shame? ﻿You packed. ﻿You took a taxi. ﻿Do you need help with the suitcases? ﻿Yes, and call me a cab. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿A friend. ﻿What friend? ﻿You never told me about a friend. ﻿What do you mean a friend? ﻿I have the right to know, don't I? ﻿We're not together anymore. ﻿I have to go. ﻿How do you know him? ﻿I met him at work. ﻿When? ﻿Two years ago. ﻿And you've been in touch with him all this time? ﻿Yes. ﻿All this time you've been cheating on me? ﻿Why don't you answer me? ﻿I'm trying to find an answer. ﻿What's there to find? Say yes. ﻿Yes. ﻿What are you doing? I have to go. ﻿You're not going anywhere. ﻿Are you hearing yourself? ﻿For two years you've been cheating on me behind my back. ﻿My friends probably know and are laughing at me. ﻿They're not laughing at you. ﻿So they do know about it. ﻿They look at me as if... - As if what? ﻿As if everything's fine. ﻿Let me go. ﻿You're not leaving until we figure this out. ﻿Don't touch it. ﻿Hello. ﻿Hi. Okay. How are you? ﻿I miss you too. ﻿I'm taking a cab and coming over, okay? ﻿Bye. ﻿Edith, wait a minute! ﻿Edith, wait a minute. ﻿Enough... We heard a great performance of Beethoven's Third ﻿with that Italian, what's his name... Simply wonderful. ﻿Really wonderful. ﻿There are two more concerts. ﻿If you'd like an invitation, let me know. ﻿For Beethoven's Third there's only one rendition. ﻿Otto Klemperer's. ﻿Otto Klemperer's rendition is passe. ﻿You're talking nonsense. Passe... ﻿Klemperer's rendition passe? ﻿Why nonsense, because I don't agree with you? ﻿What do you know about Beethoven renditions? ﻿They used to know how to play Beethoven. Now, no one has a clue. ﻿Ruby wrote his doctorate exactly about this. ﻿And if he were a professor, would that change my opinion? ﻿You don't understand anything. ﻿Listen, listen. ﻿Sit down honey. ﻿Listen. ﻿Aharon, enough! Come back to the table. ﻿Leave him. ﻿Why? - That's how he deals with his anger. ﻿He's completely crazy. ﻿Quiet. Listen. ﻿It's exactly... ﻿Listen. Listen. ﻿Enough, Dad, stop it! ﻿You don't understand what you're talking about. ﻿Nothing. You understand nothing. ﻿It's all over. It was not meant to be this way. ﻿Everything went to hell. ﻿It's all over. ﻿You want it? ﻿Stop. ﻿Where's Adel I a? ﻿Aharon... ﻿Aharon... ﻿Adella... ﻿Aharon... ﻿Adella... ﻿Aharon! ﻿Stop! ﻿Adella! ﻿Adella! Mom...? ﻿I don't know where my mother is. ﻿Maybe she's dead. ﻿I love you. ﻿I love you. ﻿Hello. ﻿I don't believe it... ﻿Gladly. ﻿I say gladly but it isn't... ﻿exactly so. ﻿It's getting hard to meet people ﻿I haven't seen in a long time. ﻿Age becomes cruel ﻿when you don't meet regularly. ﻿I bet I could die when I see in your eyes how much I've aged. ﻿I'll call you tonight and we'll meet tomorrow. ﻿I'm going. ﻿Already? ﻿I'm meeting Dad... ﻿I want to see him before he leaves. ﻿Wait, I want you to take your cookies. ﻿Who was it? ﻿What? ﻿Who was it? ﻿Ah, ﻿my first boyfriend. ﻿Hagai Wolf? - Yes. ﻿What does he want? ﻿Just to meet. ﻿Is he divorced? ﻿No. ﻿Are you going to meet him? ﻿I don't know, maybe. ﻿Call me when you get to the base, okay? ﻿Okay. ﻿Why did you leave? ﻿Because... ﻿Because what? ﻿Because you slept with someone else. - But I didn't sleep with him. ﻿Then why didn't you say so? - How can you say that? ﻿I stood in the street wailing but you wouldn't listen. ﻿You said that your mascuhne pride was wounded. ﻿Why are you laughing? ﻿Each time we meet since we broke up ﻿we have the same conversation ﻿I'm happy. ﻿Butthen I realize that it's pointless. ﻿It's as if everything we used to be is gone. We're different people now. ﻿It's a shame that Mom didn't come with you. ﻿She's angry with Yosef ﻿and didn't want to see him. ﻿And to see me isn't important enough? ﻿You're coming back to Israel soon. ﻿Not for another four months. ﻿What's four months? It passes like a dream. ﻿Everything passes like a dream. ﻿After all, we arrived in Israel not long ago. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿About our aliyah from Alexandria. ﻿that was in j g46 ﻿When I look back ﻿all those years seem to have passed me by. ﻿Dad. ﻿What? ﻿You've done so much. ﻿What did I do? ﻿You worked in the water company. ﻿But I was fired. ﻿You lived on a kibbutz. You grew grapes... ﻿You were in the electric company. ﻿You were active in the party. ﻿What do other people do? ﻿Good question. ﻿What do they do? ﻿Other people's lives always seem more meaningful. ﻿What makes things Meaningful is only your perception. ﻿May I? ﻿You want coffee? ﻿I don't drink coffee at lunch. ﻿Okay, you don't have to. ﻿One coffee. ﻿You want a cake? ﻿No cake. ﻿That's it. Thank you. ﻿They have great cakes here, you're missing out. ﻿'ve been missing out all my life. ﻿Why, Dad? ﻿What are you missing ﻿Joy. ﻿You don't have any joy? ﻿Something uplifting ﻿Like it used to be. ﻿When? ﻿In Alexandria, when I was young. ﻿There was spirit. There was love. ﻿Love... ﻿Love. You know what love is. ﻿I've heard about it. ﻿And what about you? ﻿What? ﻿What about your life? ﻿Fine. ﻿Perfectly fine. ﻿That's what I thought. ﻿What? ﻿It doesn't sound exciting. ﻿Is there a chance that you and Edith will get back together? ﻿So much sugar for such a small cup. ﻿I like it sweet. ﻿I like it sweet too but... ﻿You have to watch out. You're not a baby anymore. ﻿Okay. ﻿So, what are we doing now? ﻿You wanted to sail on the Seine. ﻿I can do without sailing on the Seine. ﻿I saw Yossef, that's enough for me. ﻿I can just sit on a street bench. ﻿Isn't it silly? ﻿To come to Paris to sit on a bench? ﻿Tell me what you want to do and we'll do it. ﻿Tell me what to do and I'll do it. ﻿What do I ever ask for myself? ﻿I even gave up on pajamas. ﻿Why did you give up on pajamas? ﻿Because of your mother. ﻿I told her that my pajamas were full of holes. ﻿And? ﻿She told me that no one sleeps in pajamas anymore. ﻿So I sleep in my underwear. ﻿If it's so hard to buy me pajamas... ﻿So buy it yourself ﻿why does she have to buy your pajamas? ﻿Because she's our minister of finance. ﻿So it's about money. ﻿For Mom, everything is about money. ﻿Come on, I'll buy you pajamas. ﻿Do you hear what you're saying ﻿At my age ﻿my son has to buy me pajamas? ﻿By the way ﻿what about you're exhibition? ﻿It's gonna take a few more months. ﻿What's that got to do with pajamas? ﻿It's not about pajamas, it's about my old age. ﻿I hope I'll still be around to see your exhibition. ﻿Ugh, Dad. ﻿Dad what? ﻿You think a father lasts forever? ﻿One day I'll die. ﻿You'd better start getting used to the idea. ﻿Yes. ﻿Cheers. ﻿There's eggplant salad. ﻿I don't want eggplant salad. ﻿Like Grandma Riva makes. ﻿Just a moment... ﻿Did you hear anything from Dad? ﻿He called yesterday. ﻿When is he coming back? ﻿Do you miss him? ﻿Sometimes. ﻿So maybe... ﻿What's going on? ﻿What? ﻿Everything's fine. ﻿It doesn't look that way. ﻿What? ﻿Nothing. ﻿I can feel it. ﻿Tell me. ﻿I don't know how I'm gonna make it through another two years. ﻿The day after you were born ﻿I dreamt you were being drafted. ﻿And... ﻿There was a row of soldiers and I pulled you out of the line. ﻿But I was a baby. ﻿In the dream you were a soldier. ﻿The officer yelled at me "What do you think you're doing?" ﻿I said to him ﻿"he was just born he can't be drafted". ﻿Edith? ﻿Where's Edith? ﻿Edith? ﻿Edith! ﻿Let's go check on him. Okay. ﻿Dad. ﻿What happened? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Go to sleep. ﻿She looks like Mom when she was young. ﻿Yes, a little. ﻿I dreamt about dad last night. ﻿I dreamt that we went to visit the Gurevitch family ﻿and... ﻿They gave us a huge, ﻿hard table to sleep on ﻿and Dad kept moving closer to me ﻿even though there was enough room for everyone. ﻿I said to him "Dad, it's bothering me." ﻿Then he put his hand on my mouth... ﻿Suddenly I woke up choking and coughing like I couldn't breathe. ﻿It was strange. ﻿Maybe something was bothering me while I was sleeping ﻿and that's why I dreamt it. ﻿I remember it. ﻿What? ﻿What you just said. ﻿But it's a dream. ﻿But it really happened. ﻿What? Going to the Gurevitches? We always used to go there. ﻿No, that Dad... ﻿What? ﻿That he used to get close to you. ﻿I remember being so jealous. ﻿I knew then that he'd never love me the way he loved you. ﻿But you know how much he loves you. ﻿Yes, but he never got close to me. ﻿Maybe you'll stay home today? ﻿I have to go. ﻿We'll clean the windows for Passover. ﻿"Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe ﻿"who has sanctified us with his commandment to bum hametz." ﻿Who are you making this dress for? ﻿For a girl. ﻿What's her name? Nahum, ﻿we don't see you anymore at the post office. ﻿Have you stopped writing letters? ﻿My aunt died. ﻿But I didn't die. ﻿I wish I could paint shutters like that. ﻿You can. ﻿I don't have enough faith. ﻿With this ring... - With this ring... ﻿You are consecrated to me... - You are consecrated to me... ﻿According to the laws... - According to the laws... ﻿Of Moses and Israel. - Of Moses and Israel. Nahum. ﻿Why did you do it? ﻿What did I do? ﻿Love me. ﻿Why don't you love me anymore? I love you. ﻿Really? ﻿It's good that you came. ﻿What's up? ﻿Go in. She's waiting for you. ﻿What did the doctor say? ﻿What do you want him to say? ﻿He gave her antibiotics. ﻿Antibiotics? ﻿Antibiotics aren't good. ﻿Why antibiotics? - How do you know? ﻿Are you a doctor? - No, but I know. ﻿She has a throat infection. - And? ﻿You don't play around with a throat infection at her age. ﻿Did you ask another doctor? ﻿Why ask another doctor? ﻿Go see her. - In a minute. ﻿Not in a minute. Now. ﻿She's been waiting for you since this morning. ﻿Why is she waiting? She knows I'm working. ﻿You know her. Go see her. ﻿Go in. ﻿Look after Dad. ﻿What for? ﻿If sommething happens he shouldn't be left alone like a dog ﻿Why would anything happen? ﻿What do we know? ﻿In three days you'll be as healthy as a lion, Mom. ﻿I wish I understood. ﻿What? ﻿Something. ﻿Where do we come from. Where are we going. ﻿From dust to dust. ﻿I know that, ﻿but there must to be an explanation. ﻿There must be an answer. Otherwise it's all meaningless. ﻿What's meaningless? ﻿Where is everything? ﻿Where is what? ﻿Everything that was. ﻿Everything's here. ﻿I'm trying to see myself ﻿but I can't. ﻿I don't understand. ﻿You don't understand? ﻿No. ﻿One day you will. ﻿I don't understand. ﻿Only yesterday the doctor said she was improving. ﻿I don't understand. ﻿What are they called? ﻿Who? ﻿These grapes. ﻿Tamar, maybe. ﻿No, it's not Tamar Tamar grapes are longer. ﻿You're right. ﻿It's not Tamar. ﻿No, it's not Tamar. ﻿Are you still here? ﻿It's good that you're here. ﻿I'll put together an album of her photos. ﻿She was very photogenic. ﻿Everyone who photographed her said so. ﻿Look. ﻿Look at her. ﻿She's so beautiful. ﻿Yes. ﻿This is at school. ﻿Is that her? ﻿Yes. ﻿You see, she stands out. ﻿Again, it's her. ﻿Yes. ﻿Maybe you want... ﻿to go... ﻿to Alexandria to look for your house? ﻿I m sure we won't find it everything was destroyed there. ﻿maybe we can find the school you studied in. I'm sure school was destroyed too. So maybe we’ll go and... ﻿We'll search. We might find something. ﻿Why are you laughing? We won't find anything. ﻿Everything is inside. ﻿It's all in here. Maybe you'd like a dog? ﻿Why would I want a dog? - So you won't be alone. ﻿I can't be here all the time. ﻿Trhere are days I have to go out of town and... ﻿I don't need a dog. I need someone to talk to. ﻿You can talk to the dog. He'll listen to you. ﻿And who will answer me? ﻿You will. So you suggest that I to talk to myself, then why do I need a dog that I have to feed ﻿and walk every day? A dog has no demands. He won't tell you what to do and what not to do. Why would I need a dog to not tell me what to do and what not to do when I already have all of that without a dog. ﻿You're right. ﻿I didn't think about it this way. ﻿Which way did you think? ﻿So that you wouldn't be alone. ﻿How's this one? ﻿It's a bit too large. ﻿She loved that dress. ﻿We bought it together for Green's daughter's wedding. ﻿We didn't go to the wedding. ﻿You did. We went together. ﻿I'll try this one on. ﻿Isn't it a little early? ﻿What? ﻿This liquidation of Mother. ﻿What do you want us to do? ﻿That's life. ﻿We come and we go. ﻿What are these letters? ﻿From you? ﻿I didn't write letters. ﻿What's written there? ﻿Who signed them? ﻿It's not clear. ﻿Who are they addressed to? ﻿It's for Mom. ﻿Maybe it's from her sister when she was abroad. ﻿Yes. ﻿Show me. ﻿Yes, it's from her. ﻿Show me. ﻿Who's in the picture here? ﻿Let me see. ﻿I don't believe it. ﻿How come she didn't tell me? ﻿We never lied to each other. ﻿It's not lying. ﻿Then what is it? ﻿It's life, Dad. All sorts of things happen. ﻿How's this one? ﻿What do you say, Shmuel? ﻿It suits you very well. ﻿I think so too. ﻿I'll pick it up later. ﻿Everything is worthless. ﻿That's not true, Dad. You had a wonderful life. ﻿The fact that someone loved Mom and wrote her letters ﻿doesn't take anything away from what you two had. ﻿I'll tell her to -No, no. go. ﻿Let her take what she wants. ﻿Mom...? ﻿Mom...? ﻿Tammy, tell us a story. ﻿I have nothing to tell. ﻿Tell us about the heart of the world. ﻿I already told you. ﻿So tell us one more time. ﻿All right. ﻿At the edge of the world there's a mountain. ﻿On the mountain there's a rock and from the rock flows a spring. ﻿On the other end of the world there's the heart of the world ﻿that looks at the spring and wants to reach it. ﻿And so, day after day the heart looks at the spring ﻿longing for it and wants to go to it, ﻿but it doesn't go. ﻿Why? ﻿Because if it gets too close to the mountain, ﻿the peak with the rock and the spring. ﻿And if it can't see the spring, it won't long for it. ﻿And if it doesn't long ﻿Why? ﻿Because longing is like love ﻿and without love we can't live. ﻿The film was produced with the support of the Israel Film Fund ﻿The Ministry of Culture and Sport ﻿The Israel Film Council English translation Paul Fisher
