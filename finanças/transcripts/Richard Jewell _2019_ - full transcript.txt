I'm gonna have to have you let me do my job, Curlicue. - And this is our room. - Yeah. Are you aware of the notion of unlawful search and seizure? Asshole, you're not supposed to just walk in here. Keep pushing me. Keep testing me. - See if you like where it gets you. - Yeah? You all right? What did I say freshman orientation week? I said, "No drinking on my campus.11 I don't know why no one called my attention to your file before. I mean, all these complaints about you. Physically assaulting a student. And have you really been pulling people over on the highway? Um, yes, sir, I have. I figured that if you do the drunk tests on the road, trouble never gets to the campus. We don't have any jurisdiction on the highway. And I realize that, but I believe in law and order, sir. - You can't have a country without it - Mmm. And you were dismissed from the Habersham County Sheriffs Office. "I don't want any Mickey-Mousing on these grounds." Isn't that what you said? When did I say that? You said it at Founders' Day last year, I believe. You were by the punch bowl. I walked up to you, and you said to me, uh... Well, I had interrupted you. I apologized, I introduced myself and I said I was gonna be the greatest campus security guard you ever had. And you said, "That's good. I don't want any Mickey-Mousing on this campus.11 I think I mighfve even wrote it down. I write down most things. and I get a fucking Kenny Rogers concert. It could be worse. Could be equestrian. - I'm getting my tits done. - I don't see how that applies here. This time next year, we're all gonna be scrambling for jobs on TV. What do you think, D cup?

They're not listening to me. Maybe they'll listen to you. People respect the badge. I think we should take it down to the House of Blues and see how much we can get for it That's a clutch idea. Hey! Get away from there. Go on! Get off it. What you all doing? Go on, get outta here! - Hey, you guys. See if... - Go on. Run home to Mommy. Hey, see if they left a backpack under my bench. Atlanta 911. Can you understand me? Yes, Go ahead. You defy the order of the militia What? I got another weird one. Well, it ain't theirs, Richard. I don't like this. We got ourselves a suspicious package. We better call it in. Probably just somebody run off drunk and forgot they left it. I still think we ought to call it in. Just take it to lost and found, Richard. Shouldn't we unzip it, and see what's inside first? No, no, you don't wanna touch that. You got to follow protocol. Son of a bitch had to get left under your bench, didn't it? We need assistance on an unclaimed bag- A suspicious package. A suspicious package over at section four. We ought to set up some kind of a perimeter, too. - Just back away. - Perimeter?

Well, if the cops tell us we gotta go, we'll go. The band's in the middle of a set. We can't just shut down. Yeah, you know what, if I have to come back here, there's gonna be no questions and no hesitation. Hey, guys. We got a bomb scare in front of the tower. You should be aware of that.

Right there. I don't know how long it's been there. Oh, Lord. They told us in training. It's real. "You ever see the bomb guy go pale, run.11 We got three pipe bombs in that bag. Biggest I've ever seen. We need to clear a 100-foot perimeter immediately. Vail got a bomb blanket? The Render-Safe team can be here in 20 minutes. Richard...

And please, whoever he is, let him be fucking interesting. Amen. Are you Jewell? - Uh, yes. Yes, sir. - I'm Tim Barker, AT&T Media Relations. Did I hear this right? You're the one who discovered the bomb? Yes, sir, I did. That makes you a hero, you know that? I was just doing my job, sir. That's a nice thing to say, Richard, but we're getting requests from a lot of people who wanna talk to you. Would that be okay? CNN, Katie Couric, those types. Your superior gave the okay. I gotta tell ya, there were a whole bunch of folks clearing people out. Police personnel, medics. It wasn't just me. You're the one who spotted the package. You're the one people wanna hear from, okay? Can we get you something to drink, take care of you? I could use a cup of coffee - if they're gonna make me speak on TV. - Sure. Absolutely. With us now is Richard Jewell, the security guard who first spotted that knapsack that contained the bomb and began clearing people away before it exploded. - Richard Jewell, welcome, - Thank you. A lot of people are calling you a hero. Do you feel like one? No, ma'am, I feel like, uh, / was a person that did the job that I was supposed to do. / was in the right place at the right time and used my training in the way I was taught The real heroes are the paramedics and the firemen, all the agents that placed themselves between the bomb and the people that were refusing to move because they took most of the shrapnel themselves. Good for you, Radar. You played a big role. You were in the right place at the right time and you did the right thing. Thank you very much, I really appreciate that Thanks so much for coming in. Thank you for having me, I appreciate it And we'll be back with more from Atlanta right after this. My boy. Find it. That's it. Find it. Right here. We got one. How'd you feel about that one, Richard? I think it went well. It was... Everybody was really nice. Made me feel okay about it. - Yeah. You were great, - Good job, Richard. Hey, thank you. Hey, I had a question for y'all. I worked with some guys who got injured last night. Green, Silver, Miller. You know if they made it out all right? Yeah. Word is all the cops are gonna make a full recovery. - That's great Thank you very much. - Thank you. Richard, there's someone I'd like you to meet. This is Mr. Brenner from Bernstein and Crane. You know the company, they publish books. Uh, nice to meet you, sir. Hello, Richard. Pleasure to meet you. I would like to talk to you about your story. Are you free? - Uh... Am I free? Can I talk to him? - Sure. Sure. All right. Let's get a cup of coffee. Better yet, let's get something to eat. You're not gonna hear a complaint out of me for that. Let's get you something good. No, no, no. I gotta go. I gotta go. Richard. Oh, my Lord. You're everywhere. I mean, the phone has just been ringing off the hook. I need a secretary. Yeah, I think I might need a secretary, too. Some guy from New York just asked me if I wanna write a book. You don't mean it No, I'm not kidding you. They tell me, apparently... Oh, Lord. Apparently, they got somebody who they think up all the stuff in the book, they type it out and then they just ask you, "yes or no," "true or false/1 "did it happen?" Then they pay you. You do that for money. Oh, my God, you're a rock star. Tom Brokaw was even talking about you. I can't even think right now. Are you all right? You've been up for so long. - Oh, my God, it was so horrible. - Mama, I'm sorry. I didn't even hug you. - It was so awful. Awful. - I know, I was there. Oh, my God. Be thankful that you weren't there. - You could have been there. - I know. - I couldn't have handled that. - No. You were there two nights ago for Kenny Rogers. Can you imagine if you were there last night? I know. I know. Sit down. Sit down. You must be really hungry. I'm gonna give you some food. Oh, my goodness. Oh, Mama, I'm telling you what... It was complete chaos, Mama. And to think I could've called in sick. Think about how I was feeling yesterday. - I know. - I could've called in sick. I know. - Then what? - Oh, my Lord. Shaw. - No, I gotta go. - Doing okay? No. That bomb went off on my watch. That's my fucking park. We didn't have enough eyeballs there. That's on us. Let's just catch the son of a bitch, yeah? Yeah. I need you to get out to Habersham County. Background on a former sheriffs deputy. Might have some connection to the bombing. Who is it? The security guard. Hey, Richard! Hey, way to go, man. You made us all real proud. Thank you. Dr. Cleere, we wanna thank you for contacting the FBI regarding your suspicions about Richard Jewell. I want to be clear, I haven't accused him of anything. We completely understand. I just... I see the attention he's getting. It's the kind of attention he was always seeking here. Harassing students, pulling people over on the highway. Just crazy behavior. And I decided if my fears were correct, if he actually wasn't the hero they're making him out to be, and I had information pertinent to the fact, which I failed to bring to light, it could jeopardize lives. Well, Dr. Cleere, you did the right thing in calling us. We will, rest assured, follow up on this. Do you mind if we take this folder with us? Please. We'll make a copy and get you the original back. Why is the goddamn ACOG reopening that park? We don't have shit! Okay, I wanna hear more about Jewell. Patrick? All right. Well, when I look at Jewell, I think about the bomb scare at the LA Olympics in '84. A bag left on a bus by the same cop who then discovered it And the fires in Idaho this summer started by a firefighter who wanted the credit for putting them out. A profile emerges here. The false hero. In interviews, Jewell's account of the bombing seems vague and he looks uncomfortable discussing the victims. I also found that his mentioning on TV that he wanted to get back into law enforcement a bit inappropriate. There's a lot here that's troubli And everything that Agent Shaw has learned about him syncs up with this profile. You agree with that, Tom? Yes, sir, I do. Let's put eyes on him. - Watson? - Yeah? -Yeah. If so, that's an affirmative. It's Richard Jewell. "Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell? "Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell, line one. Hello? Mr. Bryant Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. I just got your number from Information. I hope you remember me. Radar, you can call me Watson. You're a national hero now. I'm glad you called. We're running out of Snickers, Thank you, sir. How are you? How's your family? we're all fine, yeah, yeah. / see you've moved up from video games. Yep. Yeah, I didn't mean to, but I guess I did. Good job. That's a prideful thing. What can I... What can I do you for? Sir, I was calling you because I wanted to know, have you ever done a book deal? What, uh... Why? With this whole bomb thing, I got these New York guys who are asking me to write a book and I don't really know anything about that. So I thought maybe I could call you, you might be able to help me. Sure, Sounds a little far-fetched, but contracts are contracts, but, yeah, we could talk. So, are you not the US Small Business Admin anymore? 'Cause I tried there first No, I moved on. Oh. How come? Lifestyle decision. What's your phone number? My phone number is 404... 404... - 194... - 194... - 8188. - 8188. All right, well, you just don't sign anything until I see it first. We'll start there. Yes, sir. Yeah, I won't put a pen to the page. I'll wait on it. Hey, and thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. You got it All right, bye. - Stay in touch. - Yes, sir. - Okay. - Bye, No, no. Don't get too excited. - No. - Yes. No. Simmer down there, hot sauce. Well, Bill Miller. It's nice to see you. It's been a while. It's nice to see you, Bobi. Where's the hero? Oh, he's in here. Come on in. What kind of charge you figure it was? Mmm. I'm not sure what kind of explosive the guy used. It could have been black powder, match heads, maybe some kind of chlorate packed with nails. You know, the funny thing is the package was supposed to blow out, right? So, when those drunks, those kids knocked it over, they saved a bunch of lives. Because it was supposed to blow out into a crowd for maximum casualties. But when they knocked it on its back, it blew upward. Most of the ordnance going up into the sky. It blew up. So, all in all, what you're looking at is some kind of battery, and some kind of timing device, like a simple clock. Maybe awristwatch like I'm wearing. Depends how high-tech the guy got. Some of these guys, especially if they're ex-military or they're some kind of whiz out of some university, they're gonna use a combination of different bomb tactics. Other people are following it like a recipe. - They're probably losing a finger to it - Yeah. But depends on who you're talking about and who's making the bomb. Well... I like getting your opinion on it, and I'm sure you've studied it quite a bit. - Who knows? - Mmm-hmm. That's the thing, too, about these bombers. It could have been you or me. These guys, some of them, look like regular people. Lot of them do. Yeah. Must be a lot of pressure on you guys. No more so than usual. Sure, just another... Thank you. Just your average deadly bombing on US soil during the Olympics. No big deal. I don't know, you guys must be feeling the heat, too, huh? Mmm-hmm. CNN is going wall-to-wall with this. Is that why we get this outfit? So, then give me something I can print. Kathy, you know I can't do that. That's all right. I already know the Bureau's looking into somebody. Yeah, what makes you think that? Friends. - Friends? - Sources. Sources? Who is it? Well, Kathy, if you couldn't fuck it out of them, what makes you think you're gonna fuck it outta me? You know what bothers me, Kathy, is that people don't understand how much work goes into making a case like this. It's effort 24/7. Hmm. You're right Why don't you educate me? I will not have this screwed up. That was a massacre out there. It's a miracle more people weren't killed. I would never go to print without independent corroboration from a second source. And that would put us in a very different zone. As you know. Really? Mmm-hmm. What kind of zone? You have to find out We're looking at the security guard, Jewell. - No shit? - No shit. You always look at the guy who found the bomb, just like you always look at the guy who found the body. But this guy, he's got a bad past. Fits the profile of the hero-bomber to a T. That fat fuck who lives with his mother. Of course. How did I miss that? I mean, that is amazing. Ooh. You are good. You're very good. Yeah. This kind of puts a clock on things, though. You wanna get a room or just go to my car? This is happening. This is happening. Let's get the fuck outta here. - Okay. - Yeah. Sugar, I need you to do one of those better word things you do. You mean rewrite you? Yeah, you know I write like a brick, and this one is kind of special. What is it? Oh, nothing. It's just that the, uh, the FBI is looking at Richard Jewell as the bomber. Do you have time for me now? - I got all the time you need. - All right, let's work. Tell me everything. Where you going? To get my notes. "The security guard who first alerted police to the pipe bomb that exploded in Centennial Olympic Park is the target of the federal investigation into the incident that resulted in two deaths and injured more than 100. Richard Jewell, 33, a former law enforcement officer fits the profile of the lone bomber. This profile generally includes a frustrated white man who is a former police officer, member of the military, or police wannabe who seeks to become a hero. Jewell has become a celebrity in the wake of the bombing, making appearances on The Today Show," FBI knows you have this? Oh, yeah, My guy says everybody's got it. Networks have it. CNN has it. Got a guy at GBI says the same thing. Bureau's looking at Jewell. Then why isn't anyone reporting it? Anybody feel like we're getting worked here? God damn, John, these are our Olympics. If we don't lead on this story, what the fuck are we doing here? Okay. Tear up the afternoon edition, and replate the front page. We're running it Thank you. This is CNN Breaking News, We've been asked to relay the story to you verbatim, which we'll do. "The security guard," and this is a quote from The Atlanta Journal, "who first alerted police to the pipe bomb that exploded in Centennial Olympic Park is the focus of the federal investigation..." Now, to recap quickly, we are just getting details on what appears to be a major development,. Congratulations. Whoo! Yeah! Who the fuck leaked this investigation to the AJC? Huh? Shaw! - Sir? - Get Jewell in here. Nonconfrontational interview, today! - Hello? - Richard Jewell? Yeah. I'm... I'm Richard. Special Agents Dan Bennet, Tom Shaw, FBI. You got a minute? Yeah, I've got... Yeah, I've got a minute. Come on in. Thank you. Ma'am. Um... Um, Mama, this is Agent Bennet and Shaw. - Nice to meet you. - This is my mother, Bobi. - How do you do? - Pleasure, ma'am. What can I do for y'all? Well, the Bureau's actually putting together a training video on how to deal with suspicious packages, and we'd love you to be a part of it. How's that sound to you? I would love to help out with that, yeah, absolutely. You did it, Richard. You showed them what kind of cop you can be. Look at this. See, the only thing is that we're shooting it today. So, we'd need you to follow us to the field office right now. Because time's a little bit tight. Is that okay? You know what? I would love to, but I still got to work today. I got my shift Uh, this won't take long, Richard. Yeah, you know what? I bet we can make that work. I can call in and tell them I'm gonna be a little bit late. I mean, I want to help you all, and I'm law enforcement, too. - We know that Yes, indeed. - We know that. Yeah. - All right - So, you're all set to go, then, huh? - Yep. Yeah. - Great. - Let's do it - Lovely to meet you, ma'am. - Thank you very much. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Lovely home. I don't know what's going on. I'm so proud of you. Oh, goodness. - Mr. Jewell... - Why are the FBI here? Mr. Jewell, what have they told you? Are they letting you go back to work? Uh, yeah. They're letting you go to work? You're good to go? Yeah. Are the FBI investigating you? I imagine they'll investigate anyone who was at the park that night. That includes all of you, too. Have they told you yet you can't leave town? No. Mr. Jewell, are you under arrest? You're free to go wherever you like? You're free to go wherever you'd like, Richard? - Who are you working with? - What happened out there? What do you think of the appearance that people are saying that you are now the prime suspect? What's going on, Richard? I'm not a suspect. Why are you talking to the FBI? Mr. Jewell, what does the FBI want with you? Can you give us any more information? Sorry, I think I got some media following me. No. Those are our guys, bud. Those are our guys. "Richard Jewell, 33, a former law enforcement officer," the story goes on to say, "fits the profile of the lone bomber. This profile generally includes a frustrated white man who is a former police officer, member of the military, or police wannabe who seeks to become a hero. The security guard who first alerted police to the pipe bomb that exploded in Centennial Olympic Park," So, up until it obviously went sideways, everything pretty normal about that evening, right? No, it was a regular night from what I could tell. Everyone was having a great time. It was like a celebration. Yeah. No air of... Yeah, you were having fun. I was having fun. It was a good time. But there was some guys with beer cans or something like that? Guys behind the tower. What were they doing there? They were throwing... - Beer bottles. - Beer bottles. Yeah. They were horsing around, fooling. I broke it up and I gave them atalking-to, and they left Yep. And that was behind the tower? - Yes, sir. - Right then you came back around the tower and that's where you saw the package unattended? - Yes, sir. - Right And did you see anyone walking away from the bench? No, sir. I would've tailed them if I did. Yeah. So, you have no idea who might have put that package there? No, sir. But whoever did, I think they ought to fry. Yeah. We think so, too, Richard. Absolutely. So, here's what we're gonna do. We're trying to be as authentic as possible and part of that has to do with how you treat a suspect. Mmm-hmm. All right? So, what we're gonna is we're gonna pretend that we actually brought you in, in that regard. - Right? - That... And we read you your Miranda rights and you've agreed to waive them. - In fact, we have a form you can si - Yeah. Why don't you.. This'll be good. Just so it looks real. Yeah. So, you just sign on the bottom there and we'll get that on tape and then we'll continue on with the interview. Okay. Yeah. I'm sorry, Richard, maybe I wasn't clear. You actually have to physically sign the paper. This is a real document. Well, of course. We're going for authenticity here, Richard. It has to be real for the video. sorry, sir. I don't think I would feel comfortable signing something like this. Richard, we just want... You know what? Why don't we... Why don't we take a quick break? - Go ahead and stop the camera. - Okay. Um... - Yeah. Okay. - We'll just talk for a second. - We'll be right back. - Right back. I was a sheriff deputy. Habersham County. All right, Richard. We're gonna pretend like none of that ever happened. Let's get a new tape going. Okay? Um... What we're gonna do now... There you go. I got it Get her out there and we'll throw it away. What we're gonna do now is Agent Bennet's gonna come back in the room, he's gonna reintroduce himself, show you his credentials, just like a professional interview. And then we're gonna actually read you your Miranda rights. Why would he do that? To make it more authentic, Richard. We want this to look as authentic as possible. Come on in, Agent Bennet. Mr. Jewell... Special Agent Dan Bennet, FBI. - I'm sorry. I think... I'm sorry. - You have the right to... I think maybe I should contact my attorney. Now, why would you wanna do that, Richard? I mean... You're the hero, right? Unless there's something you wanna tell us. No. But I just think I better call him. Okay. Here you go. Press nine. Yes, hello, I'm calling Information to get ahold... The name is Watson Bryant He's a lawyer. Thank you. Yeah, connect me. I'm getting his message machine. So, I'm gonna leave a message for him. Go ahead. Leave a message and that'll be... This... This is Watson. Watson Bryant, this is Richard Jewell calling in regards to, urn, something somewhat serious, I would like you to call me back. I'm at the FBI office in Atlanta, If you could call me back at your earliest convenience. Thank you. Bye, You can't leave your phone off. I have to be able to reach you. What's wrong? You need more toner? - He called three times. - Who? Who called? Who? Richard. Three times from the FBI interrogation room. All right, all right, all right, slow down. Slow down. Jesus Christ. Am I the only lawyer this guy knows? Yes. The paper says... Paper says the Bureau has him dead to rights. Where I come from, when the government says someone's guilty... ...it's how you know they're innocent. It's different here? I don't know. Looks pretty bad. I don't care. We'll get three or four cases as juicy as this tomorrow and you have so much else to do. All right, all right. Connect me with the field office, would you, Nadya? Right away. Thank you. Unless you're too busy. - Don't you have any work to do? - I have nothing else to do, no. Yes, this is Watson Bryant, attorney for Richard Jewell. I'd like to speak to my client, please. I'm sorry, sir, we have no one here by that name. Yeah, you do, actually. Put me on the phone with my client now. Please call back later, sir. Maybe we'll have more information. Dial that number again, would you? Yeah, this is Watson Bryant again, attorney for Richard Jewell. My next call is gonna be to Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes to ask him why the FBI would deny a citizen his constitutional right to legal counsel. Can I have the spelling of your name, please? Got a call for you. Hello? Richard, it's Watson. What are you doing in there? They said they needed me for a training film. No, they don't need you for... You're a suspect Have you read the newspapers? Have you signed anything? Have you confessed to anything? No, of course not. I didn't do this. All right, listen to me. Listen to me real carefully. Just don't say anything to anyone. You understand me? Get your ass out of there. Let me talk to the agent in charge. He wants to talk to you. This is Agent Shaw, This interrogation's over. Not another word, you hear me? He's been cooperating fully. Hey, did I stutter? No more questions! - Get his ass out of there, you hear me? - Okay, Well, have a nice... He hung up on me. You have a very loud lawyer. Congratulations. Were you charged? Did you do it? Did you set that bomb? Richard, what has the FBI said to Richard, what did they say to you today? What did the FBI say to you, Richard? Did the FBI charge you? Did you set that bomb, Richard? What can you tell us about the FBI interview? Richard, what did the FBI say to you? Just tell us. We are having some trouble connecting to Wayne Scott We hope to have more from him later. He can update us about the traffic situation, also since Centennial Park is... They're all after me now. ...he may be our only view of the park for a while. So we will checking back. Right now we're gonna throw it back to NBC News and Tom Brokaw. The speculation is that the FBI is close to "making the case," in their language. They probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always wanna have enough to convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case. Why did Tom Brokaw say that about you? That was Tom Brokaw with the latest update on the Centennial Park bombing. When we come back... I don't know. - Hey, who's this? - I don't know. I don't know who this guy is. Come with me. Let's get him. Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Who are you, sir? Are you Richard's friend? Who are you here to see? Who are you here to see? Are you a friend of Richard's? - Why are you here? - Who are you? I'm a friend of Richard's. Can you give us some insight? Did you help him set that bomb? What's your name? Tell us anything at all. Are you a family member? I'm a friend of Richard's. Hey. - Hey. - Shit show out there. You got that $100 you owe me? Oh! You must be Mom. How are you? I'm Watson. I'm so sorry the world has gone insane. Oh, that's annoying. Let's get rid of that, shall we? Uh... It's kind of like a drill in your ear. For the next little while, the only person you need to talk to is me. He does not open his mouth again if there's a cop present, or an FBI agent or someone from GBI, or a crossing guard. Is that clear? I was raised to respect authority, sir. Son, authority's what's outside that window looking to eat you alive. How about a beer? - Yeah, sorry. Let me grab you something. - No, no. Thanks, Radar. Yeah. I'm gonna need to be alone with your son. I hate to be rude, but if there's a third party, there's no privilege. Oh. Yeah, third party, then they can - compel anything we say. - No. Very nice to meet you. Sorry to be rude, Bobi. Thanks. You belong to any extremist groups, Richard? No, I hate all that stuff. Any anti-government affiliations or... No. Any of your friends affiliated with any fringe organizations? Not unless being a Baptist is a religious cult. NRA? N... Is the NRA a fringe group? You ever hung out with any Ku Klux Klan members? If I did, it wouldn't have been on purpose. You contacted any other lawyers about this book deal? No. You're the only one. Richard, this is capital crime here. This is death penalty. I can help you, but only if I know the truth. Did you do this? No. Are you asking if I did it? I'm asking you if you had any part of the Centennial bombing, yes. So, if you had anything to do with this, had any part in this... I did... I did not plant that bomb in Centennial Park and I made the mistake of assuming you knew that. All right, well, let's beat the hell out of these bastards. Okay? Are you his attorney? What is your relationship with Richard Jewell? I think the FBI would be derelict not to investigate Richard Jewell. They're just doing their jobs. When are you meeting with him again? No, they're just doing their job. They're just making sure no rock is unturned. Are you gonna meet with him again soon? Excuse me. Yes. I've been friends with Richard for ten years. - Are you his lawyer? - I am. - Did he set that bomb? - You are his lawyer? - Yeah. - What is your name? You'll be defending him? Possibly. Not quite real estate law, is it, Mr. Bryant? Whoa! Jesus Christ! Who the hell are you? I could be the best friend you'll ever have. Kathy Scruggs. AJC. Of course you are. Get out. Have you secured an actual defense attorney for Richard yet? No comment - Get out of the car. - See, "no comment" doesn't help me, which means I can't help you. Is that what you wanna do? You want to help me? Watson, I don't get the sense you grasp the tank that's about to roll over you. We're talking about the US government here investigating a terrorism suspect. - You need me. - Okay. Listen, crazy lady, you want me to call the cops? Oh, please do. The cops love me. I tell their stories all day. Let me tell yours. I'm just gonna ask a couple questions that'll help you tell your story. - And you need me to help... - Get out. Get out of my... - You got some balls, man. - Yes, I do. - Get out. - Come on. I'll just ask you a few questions. - Get out. - We can go together. - Come on. Til get my notepad. - Get the fuck out of my car now! Get out of my car! I'm sick of this shit. You know where to find me. - Yeah. Don't worry. - Never been on TV before. You'll be fine. Mr. Jewell's attorney, Mr. Bryant. - Thanks for coming in. - You're welcome. What are the authorities telling you about - their suspicions about your client? - Uh, nothing. No communication whatsoever? All they've said to me is that they're not going to arrest him. That's what they told me yesterday. You believe that? No. You think they are going to arrest him? I don't think they'd tell me whether they were or they weren't That's all. What do you think of the manner in which the FBI has treated your client - pursuing this investigation? - I think whoever the bum was that leaked that Richard Jewell was the focus of this investigation, he deserves to be prosecuted or dealt with in some serious way. I don't think that this investigation should be conducted under world spotlight, if you will, like this. What's your client told you about this cabin that's being searched today? It's his former residence, as I understand it. You need to understand somethi I have barely had the time to take a breath in this case since it started the other night. We have been reacting to the media, to the FBI, and I have not sat down and conducted an in-depth interview about all these things that y'all are asking me about. Then why are you so convinced of his innocence? Because I've known Richard for a while. I've looked him in the eye and I've asked him the question. But you've admitted to me you didn't even know he had a cabin. You didn't know about this... this prior arrest. You didn't know about the prior misdemeanors. There's a whole lot of priors you didn't know about. I have not conducted a thorough investigation into Richard's history. No, I understand all that. I guess what I'm asking you is considering that you haven't done that and considering there are things that you didn't know, why are you so convinced of his innocence? Because I believe him. Plain and simple? Yeah. That's right I don't know a whole lot of things about a whole lot of people that I know. I don't have Richard's police records. You may. I don't... I have not gotten up to speed on some things. That's all. But just because I don't know these things doesn't mean that I don't have a feel for where I think Richard is in this case. Were you aware that the Habersham Sheriffs Department had asked him to seek psychological counseling? I don't know that either. But I know a lot of people who ought to have psychological counseling. Watson Bryant, thank you very much. See ya Thank you. Twenty-two past the hour. We'll be right back. First of all, we wanna reassure the public that Atlanta is a safe place in spite of the tragedy of last evening. Hello? Were you arrested for impersonating an officer? Yeah, once. - It was complicated. - It was... Were you planning on telling me? Yeah, of course. I just... In all the hoopla yesterday, I guess I just forgot. Jesus Christ! What the... Was there anything else that you forgot? 'Cause I just had my ass handed to me on the fucking Today Show! Thanks a lot More great news. The man who would be king, Michael Johnson, Waco, Texas attempting to do what no man has ever done in Olympic competition, win both the 400 and 200 meters. Go. Flashbulbs flashing, Ato Boldon away last Here's Frank Fredericks, And here comes Michael Johnson, About the right speed, I guess. - Yeah? - Yeah. They're approaching the top of the straightaway. Michael Johnson reaching deep. What are we clocking? He has the lead, Michael Johnson is closing on the finish! Michael Johnson running for gold! And it's Olympic history! He destroys his own record! - Time. - Six minutes. Okay, we know the second 911 call was placed at 12... 58. From the pay phone that was right here. We also know that Richard was inside the park near the sound and light tower at 12... 57. When Bill Miller called the backpack in. He would've had to cover the distance in... One minute. So he couldn't have done it. Could've ridden a bike, I guess. There and back? No. He really didn't do this. No. This kid's getting railroaded. We're gonna help this guy. We're gonna help this guy. This kid's getting railroaded. Holy... You don't talk. I talk. They're just gonna look around. You got any guns in the house? Yeah, we're... we're in Georgia. Yeah, of course you do. Go get them. Lay them on your bed so we can see them. We don't want any surprises. How many of them are coming in here? Uh... There... There's a couple. Can they leave their shoes outside the door? Well, I could ask them, Bobi. I don't know if they would oblige. Oh, God. Oh, good Lord. Um... Were you expecting a zombie invasion or something? No, I wasn't expecting zombies. I expect deer. I hunt. You hunt? Okay. Radar, let me explain something to you. All you're guilty of right now is looking like the kind of guy who might set off a bomb. But everything you do that promotes that image is gonna hang us. Sorry. Poor choice of words. Those jackals out there, they want your ass on a chopping block. I just... Is there anything else odd or quirky or fucking weird that I'm gonna discover today? Yeah, kind I haven't paid my taxes in about a couple years. This gets better and better. Guns, guns, guns. I hate guns. Every time Richard goes hunting, I say, "Don't you dare drag a dead Bambi in here. I don't wanna eat Bambi." But you know what? Richard, when he was deputy with the Habersham County Sheriffs, he got 98 out of 100 on his shooting test. It was awesome. Mmm-hmm. That's great. -Okay. You don't talk. I talk. Say it. I don't talk. But I want those guys to know that I'm law enforcement, too. Just like them. See, right there? That's talking. That's what we don't want, okay? You picked the right lawyer, Richard. We all set? - Yeah. - All right, let's go. Come on. Let's start in the back. Bring it in. Let's go. By the numbers, everybody. By the numbers. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so, you guys go ahead and take everything. Take the carpet, whatever you need. I'm law enforcement, too, so I get it Just know that whatever you take, it's just gonna prove that I didn't do anything. Yeah, we've done this before. You'll be counsel, Mr. Bryant? That's the plan, yeah. All right, if you're gonna stay here, you're gonna have to put these on. Yeah, let's go. Gloves and booties. Yeah. You heard the man. Booties and gloves. Watson, they're taking my Tupperware. All right, let's play ball right now. We'll get it back. If y'all need help finding anyth feel free to ask one of us. We can help. Just trying to help. It's in there. You ever read that book? Got a lot in it about police procedure. It's a good one. It's kind of controversial. It's a good book. It's a good book. I can help you with that. I babysit with those. You know what? Actually, it might be easier if you guys just waited outside while we did our jobs. - Good idea Yeah, let's do that - Thank you. Let's do that, Richard. Let's get the hell out of here. Thank you. Johnson, Rosario, anything? What was the agreement? That I wouldn't talk. Yeah, whafd you do? I talked. They wanna fry you. You understand that? You know that, right? Everyone here wants to fry you. You're a little piece of bacon. Well, on a lighter note, you never did tell me the name of the firm you moved to and whatnot I opened my own. What made you do something like that? Firms mean partners, and partners think they can tell you who to be. I don't care much for being dictated to. Hey! You have no right - Come back here. - Mama, what's wrong? They went through my underthings. How much indignity do they want us to take? All right, Bobi. Hey, hold on, fellas. Excuse me. Mama, hey... Bobi. Excuse me, fellas. Bobi. - Excuse me. - What did they take from you? Hold on now. Hold on. Bobi, let me take care of it for you. Can I take care of it for you? gonna go get them. Excuse me. What can you share with us? They found some really dangerous pantyhose, apparently. -Yeah. Richard. Come here for a sec. I want to talk to you. - Come on inside. - Yes, sir. What can I help with? Just come on inside. Just for a second. What did they pull out of the house? Did he do it, Watson? No, he did not. Richard Jewell is an innocent man. He's a hero. If he's innocent, then why is the FBI here? We welcome the FBI. We're glad they're here. No, you don't. You know that's not true, Kathy. Can I see those boxes, please? All right, here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna hand you this phone, and when I do, you're gonna wait till the beep and then you're gonna say into it, "There's a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes." I'm, uh... I'm sorry, Why? We need a voice exemplar. Like you to say it a few times. "There's a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes." It might be the only way to clear your name. I do wanna help y'all. I'm law enforcement, too. Well, yeah. Then you should know how evidentiary this is, right? So, "There's a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes." "30 minutes." Okay. - After the beep? - Yeah. There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes. Okay, one more time. Just a little louder. There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes. Okay, that's great. Can you do it one more time? Maybe let's do a series. We'll do a couple in a row. All right. There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes. There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes. There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes. There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes. There is a bomb in Centennial Park. Are you fucking kidding me? No, no, you don't talk to him. It's standard procedure, they said. No, hell it is. - In Russia. - Mr. Bryant, listen. Your client volunteered this. bullshit. Maybe you can do this. Maybe you can't. You're not doing it today. Let's go, Richard. - Let's go. - I told them I'm doing it if it helps clear my name. - Let's go! Not today. - Your client agreed to this. I'm gonna sue your ass... - for intentional violation... - Okay. - ...of his constitutional rights. - Okay. I'm having all this shit excluded. You guys are full of shit Let's go. We got it. Oh, God. Have a good night. What do they want with the vacuum cleaner? All right We're done here. Richard? I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. What's wrong? Let's get you inside. Dave, can you get her something to drink? - Maybe some water? - Yeah. Sure. What's going on? It's nothing. I'm fine. They took all my Tupperware. What would they need with my Tupperware? The bomber used Tupperware to hold the nails. That's standard. Well, what does that have to do with you? And they took my babysitting tapes. My Disney movies. Yeah, I think they did that because they wanted to see if we mighfve recorded something on the tapes like a political statement or something. Why do you keep defending these people? I'm not defending. I'm just explaining. Well, stop it! - Hey, there she is. Hey. - Hi. - How you doi - Hello. This is, uh... This is Nadya She is, uh... She tells me what to do. Here. Let me take that. That's very nice of you. I thought you might want some dinner. Bless your heart. - Thank you. - Of course. Hi, I'm... I'm Richard. What did I tell you about talking, Rich? Oh. Oh, God, yeah. I guess I can't talk anymore. Come on, Richard, you can't hide anymore. - Richard, one question. That's all. - Did you do it? Richard, how many bombs have you made? What did the FBI take out of your house, Richard? Yeah. Hand grenade? - What do you got a hand grenade for? - Yeah, it's hollowed out It's a paperweight. I bought it from a military surplus store. - Yeah. - But it's nothi Christ, of course you did. Piece of the bench? Splintered piece of... What does that mean? What is that? Yeah, I took a small piece of the bench from the crime scene. - From where the bomb was? - It's a souvenir. A memento. What'd you do that for? I think it was a pretty memorable night where I did something pretty great. So, I thought maybe that was worth holding on to. Wow. Okay. Nice. - Hey. - Hey. They want your hair now, and your palm prints. Good times. Come in. 25 pulled, 25 collected. I tell you, you might have a warrant for this, but if you were to do this to me, you'd have to fight me. You'd have to beat the shit out of me! Not very lawyerly of you, counselor. Yeah, well... Can we just get this over with before my mama comes back? I'd like her not to see this. Tell me, Richard, you still proud to be law enforcement? You know what? Maybe if I did my job a little better, and got people far enough away, then I wouldn't be sitting here right now. Yeah, he's a real monster. Boy, you guys nailed it. Have you dummies done the math yet on the call from the pay phone? Hey, listen, fuck the pay phone! Okay? My clients were the people in the park that night that didn't deserve to get their fucking heads blown off. You know, I actually feel sorry for you guys. When the real bomber does it again, and the country asks, "Where was the FBI?" You're gonna say, "We were busy getting hair samples from Richard Jewell.11 - I'm done here. - All set? Great Oh, good. Well, Richard, thank you very much for your professional consideration. You know, cop to cop. "We're the FBI." I got your cop to cop. Right here. - Uh-huh. - There's the door. Found it Thank you. Richard, we need to be a little less solicitous and a little more righteous with these assjacks. I mean, it's just hairs. They'll grow back. It's fine. Whafd you say? They're just hairs. They'll grow back. They're just hair. Hey! Why doesn't this shit make you as angry as it makes me? I am angry. You could have fooled me. You're angry? 'Course I am. I don't know if "angry" is even a big enough word for how I feel. - Come on. - Then stop being such a doormat. Stop trying to be their best friend. You know, they're making fun of you out there. - You know what they're calling you? - I know that! I know what it means when he says "cop to cop." He doesn't mean cop to cop. - He thinks I'm the Pillsbury Doughboy. - Do you? Could have fooled me. I thought you guys were gonna get engaged. Hey! Richard! You go for a cookie right now, I'm gonna chop off your hands and shove them up your ass! Try eating a cookie then, fucker. Why'd you wanna represent me and be my lawyer? Hey, you looked like you needed some help. You look like you might've needed money from a book deal. Well, let me ask you, why'd you pick me? There's a lot of lawyers in the phone book. Whafd you pick me for? I picked you because you were the only one at the US Small Business Admin bureau who didn't treat me like a five-year-old, and call me, "bag of snacks" and "blimp," "Michelin Man/1 and "Pillsbury Doughboy." You're the only one who treated me like a human being! And now you're just yelling at me, telling me to be somebody that I'm not! I don't know how to be that guy! You're that guy! I'm me! What? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, my Lord. How can they do that? easy because you don't matter. That's how come. We need to go! Move! You guys gotta We need to evacuate! Mr. Dutchess. You got a minute? I got that. There you go. - Can I finish my food? - Nope. Mmm. That's good. They've decided that since you can't have placed the 911 call yourself that you must've had a partner. They think your partner must be your homosexual boyfriend, which they decided is probably me. What? They asked me to wear a wire. I told them to shove it. I said you were a hero. And they said, "Well, if he really is a hero, then he's got nothing to worry about and neither do you." They also told me that, uh, one of your GBI buddies you know, the one you made lasagna for when he came over... Yeah, Miller. Yeah. Yeah. He was wearing a wire, too. He's got a lot on you. There's, one other thing. They asked me if I'd ever had any experience with pipe bombs and I had to tell them the truth. You know, the little ones. We used to drop them down gopher holes when I was a kid in West Virginia David... Lord. I told them this was years before I even met Richard. I told them a couple times. Still... I'm sorry. It's okay. Yeah. Yep. It's okay. I did what was... Hey, turn... Come on! What are you doing? We can't be watching movies with bombs and explosions when they're listening. Come... Y'all... I'm... I'm trying to do the right thing. Right? Guys... Are they not listening? Hey, Mama, I'm sorry. Mama, I'm sorry. Please? Mama, come on out. We can watch whatever you wanna watch. I don't mind. Mama, please, I... I won't say nothing about anything. Just come on out. Mama, I'm sorry. I'm... Please? Mama, please? I know. I'm scared, Richard. I'm right there with you. It's all right. I don't know how to protect you from these people. Hey, you know... You know what? You don't have to protect me. I do the protecting. I do. Yep. Come on. Come on out You just sit down. You watch whatever you wanna watch. I don't care. I don't care. And I'm sorry I yelled. Yeah, she's had about three days to be proud of her son and then taken away from her. Yep. That ain't right sorry, Richard. Hey. You ready to start fighting back? Yeah. Richard! Are you here to turn yourself in? Don't see why we can't just let the FBI do this. You trust them with the results? You're in good hands here. Just breathe. Richard, whose idea was it for you to take a polygraph test? Watson's. How do you think you'll do on it? Fine. Do you know who put that bomb in Olympic Park? No, I do not know who planted the bomb in Centennial Park. Hey, maybe we better talk- Nah. He passed. Highest level. No deception indicated. Oh, Jesus Christ my God. Thanks, man. Hey. Thank you. Hey. Look at you, huh? You did it, man. - Yeah, we did it - You did it. We must be firm in this. We cannot be intimidated by acts of terror. / want to thank the brave security personnel. Cocaine use is up from women in their 60s. Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Look at that. - Lucky them. Holy shit, it's Jewell. Is that Kathy Scruggs? Hey. Is this what it's like behind the curtain? - Richard Jewell here. - Hello. We're just about to go demand a retraction. Then we're gonna go get a hamburger. You wanna come? - Is that right? - Yeah. This is, like, top-rate science fiction. "Bomb suspect sought limelight.11 Are you kidding me? Who the hell do you think you are? Mr. Bryant, what I do is I report the facts. - You lead the public, is what you do. - I report the facts. - The facts? - That's right That's what I do. - You ignorant, arrogant, ambitious... - Excuse me? Excuse me? How did you get this job? - How'd I get this job? - Yeah. Mr. Bryant, if you have an issue, you can take it up with the FBI - for investigating your client. - Oh, bullshit. It has nothing to do with me. All right? What I do is, I hear the facts, I report them. - That is my responsibility. - The facts? What about the truth? My guiding principle is to report the facts. What fucking principles? This isn't a principle standing next to me. Fuck your principle. This man's name is Richard Jewell. - He's a hero. He saved lives. - You're unbelievable - just coming in here. - I'm unbelievable? Do you have any idea what kind of wildfire you started? You've ruined this man's life. - Maybe you owe him an apology. - Listen... How about that? - Mr. Jewell... - You know, you are a... What? I said I'm sorry for what you and your mother have gone through. You are a miserable excuse for a journalist. You're a parasite. Anything to sell a goddamn paper, you know that? Why don't you go chase another ambulance? Kiss my ass. He's out of order. Vail can go back to work. There's nothing really to watch here. You can just keep doing your jobs. He didn't do it. Oh, fuck. You got a lot of fucking nerve sitting here. Jewell couldn't have made the call. The math is wrong. I covered the distance from the site to the phones. There's no way he would have made it in time. Yeah, we know. You know? He had an accomplice. An accomplice? Sure. Why not? What about the lone bomber profile? The wannabe cop? With an accomplice? Well, first of all, profiles are always just ajumping-off point. Oklahoma City had two bombers, if you remember. Okay, so who did it? Who is it? Like I'm gonna tell you after the way you burned me. Fine. Til just write that the case against Jewell is starting to weaken. Bad facts, et cetera. See how that goes. You know what? I'm not sure where you get this idea that I work for you, or that we work together. I don't even know why I'm fucking talking to you. I know why. And you need me just as much as I need you. You know what, sweetheart? I don't need you a goddamn bit. Can I have one more, please? Next to me is Bobi Jewell, mother of Richard Jewell. By some savage twist of fate, Richard Jewell has been wrongfully and falsely accused of murder and mayhem. Her son's accusers are two of the most powerful forces in the world today. The United States government and the media. For the past four weeks, these horrific forces have combined to make her daily existence a living hell. As I speak, they continue to crush the very life out of her and her only son. I introduce Barbara Jewell, the 113th victim of the Centennial bombing. My name is Barbara Jewell. I am employed as a claims coordinator with a local insurance agency and I have worked there for 13 years. Approximately four weeks ago, over 100 people were injured and two people lost their lives as a result of the Olympic Park bombing. My heart goes out to these victims and their families. I am so very drained. I hope and pray to God that nobody ever has to go through this again. I do not think any of you can even begin to imagine what our lives are like. The media has portrayed my son as the person who has committed this crime. They have taken all privacy from us. They have taken all peace. They watch and photograph everything we do. Like the media, the FBI follows his every move and watches my home constantly. And why? My son... My son is innocent. Richard is not the Olympic Park bomber. Richard is not a murderer. He saved people's lives. Please hear me, Mr. President, and help me. You have the power to end this nightmare. My son is a hero. I think the FBI knows that by now. If they do not intend to charge my son, please tell us. Please tell the world. Mr. President... You did good. Richard. Oh, Mama. Oh, thank you for doing that. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I cried. I didn't mean to cry. No, you did real good. You did better than good. You ready? Let's go show them who you are. Oh, God. I'm so glad that's over. You did good. All right. Gentlemen, please have a seat. We'll be right with you. All right, let me tell you how it's gonna go. They're gonna ask to see me first, set the ground rules. I wanna make sure they know I'm not gay. Richard, I think we got bigger fish to fry, but you'll get the chance to tell them that. I'm sure. Agent Shaw. Dare you to see if he's got any Snickers. Kind of hungry. You know what a 1001 is, Radar? Yes, sir. It's lying to a federal agent It's a felony. You say anything in there that isn't true, they can put you in jail without ever proving you're a bomber. Hey. You don't know what to say, you say nothing. You ask for a five-minute break, you consult with me. You do not improvise. You got that? Yes, sir. So if you don't know what to say, what do you do? - I don't say a damn thi - That's right Mr. Bryant? Can I help you? I was taking a look. How do you guys wanna handle this? We're gonna ask you some questions, and you're gonna give us some answers. How's that sound? Okay. Sounds good. I'll go get him. Hey, you ready, boyo? Yeah. I think so. Yeah. No, I mean ready. Look at these guys not as suspect to agent, but as cop to cop. Don't give them any more deference than they're due. - And don't keep calling them "sir." - Yeah, well, they're still the United States government. No, they aren't the United States government They're just three pricks who work for the United States government You understand the difference? Nobody in that room is a better man than you. You understand? Come on. You'll be fine. That's it Sit right there. Right here? Yeah. Thank you for joining us. Uh, Mr. Jewell, we've got a few questions regarding the events of July 27th, 1996, as you probably know. Specifically the bombing in Centennial Park. Mr. Jewell, you ever find yourself accessing an Internet site called Candyman's Candyland regarding the contents of The Anarchist Cookbook? No, I have not. But you do have police training in handling explosives? Asked and answered. Did you ever collect any pieces of pipe from the construction of Centennial Park? No, I did not. Do you remember telling anybody at the park, "Take my picture now, because pretty soon I'm gonna be famous"? No, sir. Really? You sure about that? 100%. How about, did you say, "I'm on my way to Atlanta It's gonna be a mess out there"? I was referring to the traffic jams. Mr. Jewell, why specifically did you want to be stationed at that sound and light tower? I just liked listening to the music and, the night before, I got to bring my mama down. We got to listen to Kenny Rogers. She liked that. That was nice. And I guess I also get a nice vantage point to take a look at all the pretty girls. I am not a homosexual. And neither is David Dutchess. So you and David Dutchess are not lovers? Asked and answered. Mr. Jewell, you said before that in your comings and goings back and forth from the stage to the tower that you couldn't get an exact fix on the time. Is that correct? Yes, but when you have the runs, which I did, excuse me, you're not thinking about what time it is. You're just trying to crab-walk to a bathroom, you know? So you don't remember the exact time that you saw the drunks throwing the beer cans against the tower? Right? No. You don't remember the exact time you first saw the backpack? That's correct. You ever seen a backpack like that before, Mr. Jewell? Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah. You ever see that specific backpack before, Mr. Jewell? Asked and answered. Can we move on? Mr. Jewell... Did you conspire with David Dutchess or anybody else to plant a bomb in Centennial Park? No. Then how the fuck did you know to be on the other side of that AT&T tower where you knew you'd be protected from the blast? A bomb went off right where you were stationed. Chaos erupts. Bodies hit the ground. Cops go flying. Hell, I was one of them. You come out without a goddamn scratch. How does that happen, Richard? Can I ask all you fellas a question? Jesus. What? Do you have any kind of case against me? I mean evidence. Like, any traces of anything on my mama's Tupperware? Or did you find any bomb-making materials in her apartment? did you find some- - Hey, hey. Hey. Richard, we don't need to volunteer- I'm gonna say this if I'm gonna say anything. I walk in here and I look at the circle decal on your windows there, and I'm thinking... I... I used to think that federal law enforcement was just about the highest calling a person could aspire to. And I'm not sure I think that anymore, you know? Not after all this. I did my job that night, and some people are alive because of that. Do you think that the next time some security guard sees a suspicious package, that he or she's gonna call it in? I doubt it. You know? 'Cause they're gonna look at that and they're gonna think, "I don't wanna be another Richard Jewell... So I'm just gonna run." How's that make anybody any safer? Y'all can keep following me around some more doing what you're doing. I can stand it. But I just know that every second you spend on me is time that you're not spending on the real guy who did it, and it's like Watson said... What happens when he... What happens when he does it again? So, do you have anything you wanna charge me with? Can you? Well... I think it's time to How'd he do? He did great. God. Yeah. Go on. Hey. Gentlemen. Agent Shaw. Got something for What's this? Marriage proposal. Oh. My lucky day. Okay. Well, this is a good start. When's the press conference? I'm assuming you'll be announcing to all the news outlets, Tom Brokaw and the like. Mr. Bryant, let me be perfectly clear. I still think your client is guilty as hell. Have a nice day. Well, you're entitled to your opinion. "This is to advise you that based on the evidence..." It's over. Is... Is it really over or is this just another one of their things? You won. It's over. You did good. I wanna see... I wanna see Mama. You wanna see Mama? Yeah. We can do that. That's real? That's what it says. "...not considered a target in the federal criminal investigation of the bombing of July 27th, 1996, Centennial Park." Hey. Hey. Hey. Thank you. Thank you. You got it. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Hello, Watson Bryant Hey. What can I do you for? How are you? How's, uh... My God, how's Nadya? They found him, Richard. Found who? Eric Rudolph. He confessed to the bombing at Centennial Park. You know when he's being arraigned? I don't know. - Can you find out for me? - Yeah. Look at you.
