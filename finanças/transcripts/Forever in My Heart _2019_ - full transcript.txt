RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Welcome home. What brings you to Dalkey? Our honeymoon, we're newlyweds. Congratulations! You know what? I've upgraded you to our garden suite. Enjoy your stay here at O'Hanlon's. Thanks very much. Thanks so much. What do you have behind your back? Got you a little something for your last day, but I have to warn you, they're quite irresistible. Flowers? Chocolates? No, you're more creative than that. Keogh's Crisps! I should have known as soon as you said irresistible. Can't have you leaving Ireland without packing your favorite Irish snack. Hey, I just organized those. It should go leprechaun, Irish flash, harp. Makes the display more fun. Fun isn't really a system of organization. I ordered them for efficiency. Right. Speaking of efficiency, what's left on Jenna Flynn's to-do list? Just one more thing, say goodbyes. Come on, take a break with me. Mm-kay. Surprise! Patrick! Was this your idea? Well, it was a father-son project. No more surprises, deal? Deal, after just one more, one final adventure for your last day in Ireland tomorrow. Then that's it, I promise. I'm gonna miss my best friend. What can I bake to get you to stay, scones, muffins, both? I'd do anything. Don't tempt me, Katherine! By the way, you wouldn't happen to know who told Charlie about my job interview, would you? I may have mentioned something. You know, you're really living up to your nickname as Loose Lips Kath, you know that? It's my Achilles heel, but in my defense, how long were you gonna wait? Jenna? I think they're hoping for a speech. Thank you all for making the last year so incredible. This internship has taught me everything about creating the perfect home away from home. I'd especially like to thank the O'Hanlons. Patrick, you are an amazing mentor. And my boyfriend Charlie, I don't even know how to put into words how grateful I am that you came into my life. So what do you say we celebrate with some music? Charlie, Liam! One, two, three, four! When you come to the end of your day And you can't think of anyone to save your life That will pull you through the big, bad world Well, the chance is you never met a Celtic girl If your breath's been taken away By the sight of a lass the second she strolled past And your heart's gone into a whirl Well, the odds are you're lookin' at a Celtic girl Bravo! I think you guys are ready to take the show on the road! Hope so. We're leavin' in a week. No! You booked a tour? We just got the call, can you believe it? We'll be playin' pubs all over Europe. That's amazing! Any news on the job back in Ohio? Not yet. The management training program is notoriously competitive, but sure would look good on my resume. You'll get it, excuse me. Talk to him, what do you have to lose? Only every single ounce of my self-confidence. Come with me. Come on, come on, come on. Liam! Kath likes you. Kath, Liam likes you. There, secret's out. I can't believe you just did that! It was long overdue. You are not the only one with surprises. Look at us. I love it. Care to do the honors? Yes. Figured I'd leave the handiwork to the handy one in this relationship. Watching all those home renovation shows with my dad really paid off, huh? Look at that! Now you'll always be here with us. I don't know how I can thank you for everything you've done for me. Thank me by coming back again soon, okay? You know you're family. I better help Liam clean up. I'll let you get that. Let's say seven a.m. tomorrow? Yeah. Okay. Hello? Jenna, hey, Dave Jordan. Sorry for calling so late over there. It's no problem at all. I'm reaching out on behalf of the team with some good news. Your application has been accepted and approved. We'd love for you to come join us over here at the Pugsley. What do you say? What do I say? Yes, yes, of course, I accept. Fantastic, details to come. Goodnight. Thank you, Mr. Jordan, goodnight. Call me Dave. Dave. Come here, I wanna show you somethin'. Charlie, for me? You shouldn't have. It's for Jenna. What do you think? Claddagh ring, never seen you so serious about a girl before. I can't let this one go. You're avoiding the elephant in the room. We'll make it work, I know we will. This is gorgeous! Here we are, Bray Head Cliffs. This is incredible. Thinkin' about your dad? I used to love visiting his village when I was a kid. I always thought I'd go back, but it's been too hard since he passed. I know, maybe next time. It's been so great getting to explore Ireland and meeting all the lovely people of Dalkey. I'm really gonna miss it. And you. I have to tell you something, Charlie. What? I got into the program. I start at the Pugsley next week. That's great. I'm so happy for you. We'll figure this out, right? I know we will. Yeah. Enjoy your stay at the Pugsley. Valet will get your bags. I'd be happy to run through the list of amenities, or show you around, if you'd like. Thanks, but I'm actually in a meeting. Sorry about that, I'm back. Thanks for covering the desk for me. Trust me, it's my pleasure. You miss bein' out on the floor, huh? Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the promotion, but it seems the higher I move up, the more confined I am to an office. I miss that face-to-face guest interaction. Well, if guest interaction's what you're looking for, there's a leak in 413. Care to help with damage control? Challenge accepted. Yeah, it's just a hairline crack. I bet we can get this fixed within the hour. Peter, why don't you take Evelyn and Paul down to the restaurant for a meal on us? We'll get maintenance up here. Thanks so much, hun! Hey, Paul, you hear that? We're gettin' a free meal. Free and meal are my two favorite words, especially when used together. You're from Ireland. He's from Ireland, I'm from Santa Fe. We met at a conference in Galway in '77. I made her an offer she couldn't refuse, marriage. How could I turn down that accent? Best friends and business partners ever since. Well, I wish you continued success, in business and in love. Follow me. Enjoy. Hi, stranger! Back from Sydney already? Or was it Toronto? Sydney, Toronto is tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, the meeting got moved up a week. Did I not tell you? We have that trip to the botanical gardens planned. Must have slipped my mind, it came up so last minute. Next weekend, I promise. Okay, but no more rain checks. I'm starting to think you're up in the air more often than you're on the ground. I will tell you, though, moving over to international has been such a fun adventure. I feel very established. I might even be ready to settle down, in four or five years. Hopefully a little sooner than that. How's 413, everyone happy? All smiles, Paul and Evelyn are the cutest couple. You know they met through work decades ago and they still work together? Looks like you got a little glimpse into our future. I'm gonna go home early. Come over for dinner? See you there at eight. As the tile goes down in the bathroom, up goes the framing in the living room. It's me. It's open! Lucas and Christopher have been shopping for paint. What's for dinner? Keogh's Salt and Vinegar Crisps. Patrick sent over a box. They were my dad's favorite. It's his birthday. I can't believe it's been 10 years since he passed. Home Solutions marathon. This is the episode where we got the idea to re-do Grandpa's house in Ireland. It was our last project together. I have something for you. Just wait. Just a little thing. Irish chocolates. - Irish swag. - Yup. An Irish hat, I'm sensing a theme. Keep digging. There's a leprechaun! Are we opening a hotel in Ireland? That's the hope, and corporate wants you to make the pitch. They were impressed by your presentation on improving guest relations, and really see you as a rising star. A rising star, they said that? An investment group in Dublin is looking to buy an older hotel and re-do it. All you have to do is convince the investors that a Pugsley is the hotel they want and need. Put together a presentation, use a little bit of that Jenna charm, and boom, we've expanded to Ireland. Well, I was looking for a little bit more adventure. You've got a deal. Great, 'cause I already booked your plane tickets. I'm even getting you there a few days early so you can make a stop in Dalkey. You can't go to Ireland without seeing your friends, right? You've thought of everything. What's so funny? I just, when you said you had something for me, I... - You thought... - I thought... Just... You have to get on a knee! Oh, right! Jenna Flynn, will you make me the happiest man in the world? Of course. I know how much Ireland means to you, so what do you think about a destination wedding? Yes! That sounds ama... I'm so sorry. Hold on one second, I'm so sorry! Okay, it's the Dubai team, - it's a big account... - Take it. Like, big, big, big, big, big, big, big. I'm just saying, the older we get, the better we play. Hope your theory's correct. By the time we hit our '90s, we'll be the greatest band of all time. If you would have asked me a few years ago what my favorite venue in the world was, I would have said London, Paris. But now, I'd take this place and its people any day of the week. Yeah, me too. Hey! Hi, Kath! Guess where I'm headed. To a very late St. Patrick's Day party? I will be in Dalkey tomorrow! You're kidding. It's been years! Well, it would have been sooner. Had you and Liam not eloped and had a wedding, I could have attended. Yeah, well, we felt spontaneous. It's about time you come back. What's the occasion? Dublin for work, with a quick stop in Dalkey first. And I have some big news. Yeah? I'm on the edge of my seat here! In person. You know, festival season kicks off on Saturday with the annual Heritage Fest at O'Hanlon's. Do you think you can make it? Music, dancing, yummy baked goods warmed up by yours truly? Sadly, I will not be able to stay for baked goods. I have to be in Dublin on Wednesday. Well, you're at least staying with Liam and I, no arguments! Deal. Okay. - Bye. - Bye! Pugsley Hotel boasts many locations, both domestically and abroad. Something wrong, dear? Sorry, I'm just imagining myself winning an award for most boring pitch. You're doing business here in Ireland? Yes, I'm preparing a presentation. There's just one problem, I have zero ideas. And yourself? I'm visiting family in Dalkey, and an old friend, if I'm lucky. I'm Molly. Jenna, it's nice to meet you, Molly. Sounds like we're headed to the same place. Now boarding the red line train with service to Dalkey. That's us! Let's hope this train ride inspires some creativity. And hopefully the rain doesn't follow us to Dalkey. My Irish is a little rusty. Sunshine always follows rain. Good things come after bad things. I like that. For me? You shouldn't have. Jenna! This is the best hug ever! That's fitting 'cause it's for the best friend ever. What are you doing here? I was all set to pick you up. My train arrived early, thought I'd surprise you. Early? That's a first. Looks beautiful. Thank you, come along. It is dessert heaven in here. Is this all for the festival? The sampling begins. I tracked down Patrick's family recipes. I'm gonna serve them up for the whole town to enjoy. Oh, my gosh! Jenna! Liam! Hi! How is it goin'? Sorry. I'm just fulfilling my duties as a designated sampler. Thank you. Jenna has some big news for us. Dave proposed. And he wants to get married in Ireland. That's amazing. Congratulations. I hope we get to meet him one of these days. He always seems to be jetting around to some country or another. Yeah, with the transfer, it's been hard for him to make the time, but he's really excited to meet you. So how's it going here? Where are all the staff? You're lookin' at them. We've made a few seasonal cuts. Seasonal cuts, before busy season? Well, we're sharing responsibilities, like meals, tending bar, baking, anything and everything. We make a great team. I've made the perfect match, haven't I? Credit where credit is due. Where are you going? Where am I going? To see a certain someone at the front desk. Hi. Jenna! Welcome home indeed. What a pleasant surprise! How are you? You look great. You have a certain glow. Well, that's for a very good reason. Tell me everything, what have I missed? We have a new addition to the staff. Charlie, you're here! You're also here. It's been a minute. It's been many minutes. How are you? Good, good, great even. Great! Great, it's great, great that you're great. Still working at the Pugsley? Yeah, I manage now. I'm actually here in Ireland on business. Always knew you'd be successful. I guess you could say I was right. I guess you could say that. So you work here now? Yeah. Me and Dad are running the place together. So good to have him back. You remember I used to have a system for those? Strictly in order of demand. Yeah, the system has since become a little more relaxed. I love this little guy, so he goes right here in front. I see. I see the promotion isn't the only new thing in your life. Oh, yeah! It's an engagement ring, which means I'm engaged. Congratulations. Good guy? Great guy. Jenna, I have got a stew cooking. What are you doing for dinner this evening? I'm staying with Kath and Liam. I should probably unpack my bags. - Nonsense. - I don't wanna put you out. I insist. Look, the three of us having dinner together, just like the good old days. Just like the good old days. Can't believe with all you do for the inn, you still have time to make your Monday night meals. I've concluded that you're super-human. I don't know about super-human. Since Katherine's taken over as head chef, I just help out here and there. A little too much here and there, if you ask me. He's been working overtime with the Heritage Festival coming up this weekend. It's gonna be a special one, though. First festival that Charlie's been back for in years. Can you make it? Charlie and Liam are headlining. It sounds like fun, but Dublin calls. I've got a big meeting on Thursday. That's a shame. It's my last season too. What do you mean? After four wonderful decades, I am officially retiring at the end of the year. You are? Congratulations! See, I knew it, I knew you had a glow. Bittersweet, huh? Definitely bittersweet. Right-o. I leave you to it. So, you're gettin' married. Yeah, yeah, I am. If that's weird... Weird, no, no, no, why would that be weird? You mean because of what we, not at all. That's in the past, right? Yeah, water under the bridge. Really though, I'm very happy for you. Thanks. That is the one thing about Patrick's stew. You always end up eatin' too much of it. Remember that one time I was homesick and he made that big feast just to lift my spirits? I'm still convinced that was just an excuse for him to show off. He thinks he makes the best fish and chips in town. He does! He even went out and caught that fish the very same day. I'm telling you, super-human. That was right after our first date, wasn't it? No, was it? We hiked from Bray to Greystones, and then it rained, and you, of course, insisted on pushing through and finishing the hike. By the time we got back to the inn, we were both completely drenched. You're right, it was our first date. So how long have you been home? It was meant to be a week, then it turned into another. Now it's been five months. When Dad told me he was ready to slow down, I decided I should come back and help. How's that been? Honest, the inn has needed a little more work than I'd anticipated. Does that explain the lack of guests? Is everything okay? Of course, talking totally minor problems. Just a tiny slump here, little minor upkeep there. I've got it completely under control. Perfect father-son project. Something like that. We're gonna get around to those repairs. Slowly but surely. No, no, no! You're right, you and Patrick have it covered. I'm staying out of it. Jenna? Molly! What a fantastic surprise! What are you doing here? I've just been visiting with my niece, and now I'm here to check in for the Heritage Festival this weekend. You two know each other? We met at the train station. You're gonna love it here. O'Hanlon's is a magical place. So I've heard. Is the owner in? He'll be back on duty tomorrow. For now, I'm afraid you're stuck with me. I don't mind that. Cute, isn't he? He certainly thinks so. Let's get you checked in, Miss Molly. Right, here's your key. We've actually upgraded you to the Garden Room. Thank you. You know, you remind me of a friend of mine, just as handsome too. I get that a lot. How's that presentation coming along? The inspiration is coming, it's just taking its time. But I'm determined to find a unique way to show Dublin why they should open a Pugsley, a twist on the usual corporate speech and slideshow. Speaking of, I've procrastinated enough, I should go. I'll see you both tomorrow. Jenna. I hope you find your inspiration. You really do have a list for everything, don't you? You need a list to keep track of all your lists. What if I focus more on families? Kids drive in business, kids equal profit, right? Isn't the Pugsley more known for its corporate, business-friendly atmosphere? Yeah, you're right. I just want to make Dave proud, you know? He's your fiance, he'll be proud of you no matter what. How did you get to be so comforting? I'm just repeating all the things you would say to me when I needed help. I am good. So, how was it seeing Charlie again? Yeah, what is it with you and Liam not telling me he's back? You have been Loose Lips Kath your entire life. This is the one time that it could have helped me. Hey, you caught us off guard coming back here I didn't wanna rock the boat. Well, there's no boat to rock. Good, then I did nothing wrong. Speaking of. I just had a massive case of deja vu, the three of us together at the Corner Note. It's like old times. Wait, let me guess, double-shot espresso with an extra shot? Guess some things never change. Hey, Dad. You're where? I'm on my way. Is everything okay? Dad's at the hospital. - What, I'm coming with you! - No... And I'm not taking no for an answer. You don't have to fuss over me, it's just a sprain. I was comin' down the stairs at the inn, and the last one got me. We were going to fix that today too. Well, whatever you need, I'm here for you. Well, actually, since you mention it, there will be a rush of guests for the festival this weekend... Which I can handle completely on my own. You know what? I can help out around the inn while I'm in town. No, we couldn't ask you to do that, right, Dad? I insist. But you have a presentation to prepare. But I want to help. Thank you, Jenna, and please, stay at the inn, free of charge. Least I can do. You know what, I can even catch the last train out tomorrow. That way I can help as much as possible. I should be back up and running just in time for the festival. Hey, think of this as practice for when you take over for me. Thank you, it's exactly what I needed. What's on your mind? Been thinking a lot lately about the upcoming changing of the guard. It's a lot of pressure, you know, following in those footsteps. You are an O'Hanlon. Running the inn is in your blood. See, you have a stubbornness. I knew that was an inherited trait. I'm going to meet Katherine to get a few things for the kitchen. I'll be back soon. Hey, we got this. Are you ready for this? Drisheen, Irish black pudding. Are you sure? It's typically only enjoyed by the most Irish of the Irish. Bring it on. It's good. Yeah! Should we walk the rest of the grounds? You know, the castle is also a popular wedding venue. Really? Should we take a quick peak? Let's. I've always loved this place. Fun fact, Killruddery House dates back to the 1700s. I'm not sure it's Dave's style. What is Dave's style, exactly? Something more modern? We haven't really talked about wedding stuff, or any future plans, for that matter. Seems like an important topic to discuss. We'll get around to it, soon as our schedules align. What else is bothering you? I've been thinking a lot about the inn. Charlie has a lot on his plate. Especially with you being back here. What does that mean? Nothing, forget I even mentioned it, it's fine. Okay. Liam told me he's single. Katherine, why are you telling me this? Well, apparently, there were a few girlfriends abroad, but nothing really stuck. Maybe now that he's back here, he's thinking of settling down? What does that have to do with me? His ex-girlfriend turns up engaged. That's got to bring up some feelings. Plus, you two did kind of leave things unresolved way back then. No, he has his own life, he's not even thinking about me. It is interesting that you're back here at the exact same time. The timing is a coincidence. Maybe it's fate bringing you back together. Aren't you supposed to believe in luck rather than fate? Hey, good news. Dubai has expressed interest in a franchise. I'm headed over there next week. Great, hope to see you again some day. We'll make sure to get in some quality us time soon. How's Ireland? It's good, or mostly good. I'm at O'Hanlon's and Patrick kinda took a spill. Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine, he's just out of commission for a few days, so I'm helping Charlie around the inn before I head back to Dublin. Hello? Did I lose you? Charlie, as in ex-boyfriend Charlie? Wasn't he off touring somewhere? Yeah, he was, but Patrick needed him, so he came back. You know that's ancient history, right? Of course. Hey, that's Will from the Dubai team. I think he wants to get the celebration started early. We'll talk soon, okay? Yeah, have fun. We started puttin' up pictures of the guests. Emma and Hans from Hamburg, Germany. Funny story with them. He's a chocolatier, she's a dietician. I can imagine the push and pull from that relationship. Opposites attract, I guess. Is that Patrick when he was young? Is that your mom? I'm not sure who that is. It's a really great idea. Shows how the inn's changed over the years. And with room for the future, top and bottom. You know, I've actually come up with a plan for these repairs. What's that? Liam and I are gonna play more shows here and around town, make more money. Savin' for a professional. Well, lucky for you, I work fast and for free. But you also don't have to work at all. Really think you can do all this on your own, huh? I kinda think you might feel the same way. So what else do we need to do before Saturday? Besides check on Dad? Help Katherine prepare the community meal, - balance the budget... - Wait! Let me write this down. Don't tell me you're makin' a list. Maintenance, staffing, budget, shows. Who are you and what have you done with Charlie O'Hanlon? Told you, got it all under control. I've got big shoes to fill, so I've put together a long-term plan. We've already cut down on staff and consolidated expenses. Well, you've got the long-term but I've got the short-term, so why don't we combine efforts and knock it all out together? You're not gonna take no for an answer, are you? Put the finishing touches on the stuff a few hours ago. Good thing I gave you a head start. Nice work. Thought you could use some more tea. Is it the kind that cures writer's block? Fresh out, I'm afraid. Can I see what you've got so far? I'm gonna start with a 3D virtual tour of the Pugsley, give it a sense of scope. It's very fancy. Problem is it's too standard. It's missing that spark, something fun. What about this? I should give the investors a big hug? I'm talking about the inn. Think about your time here at O'Hanlon's. What did you love about the experience? I think if you incorporate some of what you did working here, then your heart will show through. Less business, more heart. Thank you, for the tea and the tip. It's a pleasure, you can keep it. You're still here? The work never stops. I thought that's what the night staff was for. We've got it covered. You know, Charlie mentioned that the inn has been struggling a little bit lately. Do you two know anything about that? Struggling? Hadn't heard. What was that? What was what? You just shared a look. We didn't share a look. Katherine, I know you can't keep a secret. Don't start now. Dad? I'm in here, Charlie! What are you doing here so late? Dad, we need to talk. I've been looking over the budget. With the repairs needed, low guest numbers, staff layoffs, and now you out of commission... Look, I will be back to figure it all out. Now, trust me, I'm already feelin' much better. No, no, really, I am. We just got another letter from the city today. Electrical isn't up to code. We've been working so hard to keep up with everything, but it's just too much for us to handle. When you retire, I don't know how I'm gonna be able to take it over. Dad, I think we might have to sell the inn. Good morning. Good morning to you too. I'll put on some coffee. No need. I helped Kath with all this, eggs, tomatoes, hash browns, sausage, baked beans. Think maybe you had a little too much of that coffee. Hey, I took what you said to heart last night and incorporated some of the things guests love about the inn. I'm gonna highlight the strengths of the Pugsley, but add in some of the tradition of O'Hanlon's. I think the combination might just be the key for a sale, so thank you. I help all of our guests with their work presentations. You seem cheerful this morning. I woke up to a delicious homemade breakfast. Why wouldn't I be cheerful? You're right, no reason not to be. Good morning, Molly! Dear. Help yourself! Thank you. I'm finishing up my work so I can devote the rest of my day to helping out here. The rest of your day? Okay, now I'm sure you've had too much coffee. Well, I'm gonna need it if I'm gonna stay awake till my late train tonight. Right, you leave tonight. Okay, well, thanks for the fuel. Better get off to practice. And then we're gonna tackle the list, right? Yeah, yeah, great. So Molly, were you able to connect with that old friend of yours? Not yet, but sometimes, these things require patience. It's a virtue, you know? It's also my arch nemesis. Get it together, Charlie. You started without me. Something wrong? It's nothing. It's just the fate of the inn resting on my shoulders. It's no big deal. We're gonna get through this. Patrick will think of something, and we have faith in you, so you have a bit more faith in yourself, yeah? Yeah, right. Okay. No, that's really bad. Something else distracting you, what is it? Jenna, out with it. There's no it to be out with. Did you tell her about the ring? Course not, why would I? To lift the burden! You're gonna feel a lot better if you talk about why things didn't work out between you two. There's no point. She's happy, I'm happy. In a few hours, it's back to leadin' our separate lives. I think you two were made for each other. You and the guitar. Come on, we need to practice. Don't stop on my account. How's work comin' along? It's coming. I need to write my speech and give it that personal touch, but first, I need some fresh air. I thought maybe we could run some of those errands? I have to book more acts for Saturday, so we'll practice later, yeah? Right. Okay, let's go. Great. I can't believe you still drive Rusty. Yeah, well, he's gotten me through some of Ireland's roughest terrain. What's ironic is you almost need the luck of a four-leaf clover to find a four-leaf clover. Remember that poem? One leaf is for fame, one leaf is for wealth. One is for a special someone and one is to bring you glorious health. Could use a little of everything. This is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I guess it's not meant to be. Try having a little patience. You'll find one. You're right. I think we need... A list? I'm shocked. Hiya. We'd like these delivered by Saturday. Sure, thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. One of these too, please. All right. Told you you'd find one. Rusty doesn't sound too good. Not to worry. Sometimes he just needs a little quick minute to get going. Or maybe several minutes. Great. How are we gonna get back to Patrick's? Well, you did say you wanted a little fresh air. This is from the grand opening of the tavern 50 years ago. O'Hanlon's great addition and greatest celebration. That's me dancin' there. I can still move like that. I could use some of these photos in my presentation to the investors. Maybe they could even attach a pub, a Pugsley version of a tavern. Can I borrow a few of these? If it'll bring you back here, take all the photos you want. I guess it's time to say goodbye. No, don't get up! Come back soon, yeah? I will. I still have a few hours to help out. I can take the rest from here. You got these photos. You can finish your presentation. Excuse me. Hello? Hey, have you checked your email? I haven't had a chance to. Is everything okay? The investors had to push. Your meeting is rescheduled for Friday. Looks like you're stranded in Dalkey for two more days. That's too bad. I gotta go, but I'll see you soon, okay? Yeah, see you soon. My meeting was pushed. I don't have to leave till Friday. You're stuck with me, so put me to work! Also means you got more time to finish your presentation. I guess you could say luck is on your side after all. I guess so. Thank you! Dave! You're here, in Ireland! You surprised? Extremely! What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise my fiancee. I've been away so much recently, I thought we could spend some time together. That's so sweet. Charlie, this is Dave. Dave, this is Charlie. Charlie, so nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. Nice place you have here. It's charming. Thank you, I think. You wanna show me around? Yeah! Nice to meet you, Charlie. Nice to meet you, Dave. This is Killruddery House. It's quiet, peaceful, popular for weddings. It's nice. It's a little out of the way, though, isn't it? That's kinda the point. Me and my dad came here on our last trip. We'll think on it. We're not in any hurry, right? I figured we'll want to travel before we settle down and that way, we can enjoy being engaged for a few more years. A few more years? I was thinking we'd be married within a year, or less. I mean, if you need more time... I don't need more time. I'm sure we'll find a date that works for both of us. How are things at O'Hanlon's? Could be better, to be honest. I found out the inn isn't doing very well, so they might be forced to sell. Really? It's in such a great location. There's so much potential for business. Yeah, it's more about the history, the memories, and the staff. I've been trying to help out when I'm not working. How's that going? I still have a little bit to do, but... Hey, why don't we do some of it together? That could be fun, right? Yeah! Let's go. I know we don't have the money for a staff, but I think we can find some volunteers. Let me make a few calls. That'll hold us over for a while, but what we really need is to have you back. I'll be back. This is about my retirement? It won't be the same. How are we ever gonna replace you? I have a few ideas, don't worry. Is there something else on your mind? What? I think that's the fourth time you've topped off my tea. Oh, it's nothing. It's silly. It's Jenna. Why can't I stop thinking about her? Did I ever tell you about my very first love? No, I don't think you have. Well, we were steady for a while, conveniently during my most immature years. For some reason, I just couldn't commit fully at the time. She was very patient with me, but ultimately, I made a mistake and let her go. She went away and I was filled with regret. But then I got lucky, met your mom. All things happen for a reason in their time. But you have something that I never had with my lost love, a second chance to reconnect. Yeah, but she's engaged. Reconnecting means just more heartache. She's found someone else, and that's that. Maybe we should focus more on the reliability of the chain. You know, people like to know what they're getting, and they know what they're getting with a Pugsley. What if instead of focusing on reliability, we took a risk. You mean, like, changing the font on the PowerPoint? More than that. What if we adapt the unique ways of life around the hotel? Maybe we implement the food, traditions, even the music from the surrounding culture? That's a really great idea, but I think what people really want is familiarity with our brand. You know, it's comforting, it's safe, even. What if people want something different? Let's keep brainstorming and revisit. Yeah, let's take a break. I need some air. You know what? Go ahead. I'll catch up with you. Okay. I know. I thought you were off to Dublin! I am staying in Dalkey a couple more days. Dave surprised me here, so we're spending some time together. How wonderful! Or maybe not so wonderful. Are those your famous scones? They are indeed. The Corner Note started carrying them last month, and I just delivered a fresh batch. These bad boys are still warm. And you may have one after you tell us what's on your mind. Are you serious? I've never been more serious. What if I want one? Same rules. All right. That old friend I was telling you about? He's actually an old flame, and boy, did he sweep me off my feet. I really thought he was the one. Molly, you've earned a scone. Thank you. How do you truly know if you've found the one? With Liam and I, there was an ease, a flow. I think when you know, you know. I hesitated after Dave proposed. I think I'm starting to see that we're on two different paths, and envisioning two very different futures. Okay, good news, bad news time. We have found some volunteers to help out. They're not proper staff, but it's something, especially with the busy season startin' and the guests arriving for the festival in a few days. And the bad news? The oven is on the way out. It's hangin' in, but by a thread. We need to get someone in here. Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear. Do you want to join me for a pint? Charlie. So I have been in your position before, all right? I have faced my share of struggles. It's true, we need help. - You mind? - Please. All right, bring electrical up to code, update appliances, re-carpeting. If we don't get ahead of all this, I don't see how we're gonna be able to catch up. And this festival is your bread and butter, right? The fall is Dalkey's busiest season. We host the Heritage Festival every year. That's what brings the guests in. We rely on the festival season to stay open. This year's just been one thing after another. I think I can help. How's that? I buy you out. Everyone keeps their jobs, all your debts are absorbed. You don't have to worry about money, repairs, appliances, security ever again. Let's consider it. Dad? I don't want you to inherit a burden. Maybe he's right. Perhaps O'Hanlon's Inn has run its course. Hey. Hey. You just missed Katherine. I was hoping you could meet her. I'm sure I'll catch her before I leave. I just spoke with Charlie and Patrick. They told me about their troubles with the inn, so I offered to buy them out. What? Charlie turned me down. I guess a Pugsley just isn't the right fit for this town. Yeah, a buyout isn't the solution because it's the family, the history that makes the place so special. Well, that's what I realized. I don't have the connection to it that they do. It also made me realize something else. You were right to take the pitch in a new direction. Really? There's a reason corporate wanted you for the job. I overstepped and I'm sorry. Thank you, that means a lot. Of course. Fine work done quickly. Signature Jenna. You have something on your mind. Why do you say that? Because you always throw yourself into a project when you're trying to process your thoughts. What's up? I'm glad that you see the value in the inn, but it bothered me that you offered to buy it out before even talking to me first. And that got me thinking about a bigger issue between us. Communication, it's not exactly our strong suit. We haven't talked about our future at all. I mean, it's great that you love your new globetrotting position, but I don't want to spend half a year in Columbus alone. When I picture our future together, I barely see you in it. I knew when I took that promotion the travel could cause some strains. I just didn't wanna lose you. I just assumed that we'd want to spend a few years seeing the world together. You want to see the world, and that's great, but I'm ready to put roots down into something more permanent. I don't think a forced engagement is good for either of us. I think I should give this back. Circuit breaker needs to be reset. Looks like the fuse needs replacin' as well. I should have gotten to this sooner. Don't blame yourself. You couldn't possibly have fixed all this on your own. You're a hero, Landon. All right, everyone. Looks like we're gonna need a couple of hours to get this sorted out. I called Landon and he said he'd take the guests on a coastal excursion. He said anything for an O'Hanlon. Looks like you're gettin' a complimentary trip to the Irish coast, courtesy of Landon's Tours on Main. But don't fill up on travel snacks 'cause we'll have a traditional Irish meal waiting for you when you get back. All right, let's go! You look nervous. I'm not nervous. I know the inn's in trouble. Katherine. Why didn't you tell me? There isn't anything to tell. We're gonna get through this. I'm not givin' up. And let there be light. Could have sworn that was the right fuse. I can run down to Main Street, see what the hardware store has in stock. Or you can let me take care of it. Get back to work with Dave. Dave's gone. Called off the engagement. He's on a flight to Dubai. Sorry to hear that. Do you wanna... Not talk about it? Definitely. Think maybe that was the right fuse after all. Well, now that that's taken care of, what's next? How are your cooking skills these days? Hey, if you're gonna try and kick us out, it's too late. We've already put on the aprons. Go on, sir. How are you? I'll be good. Happy for a distraction. Really? It was an accident. Oye, kids, that's enough. You two, focus on dessert and I'll work on dinner. Did you hear me, or what? Lunch is all cleaned up. What's next on the list? New guitar strings. Need some for tomorrow's show. I know just the place. We can stop there after we get some picture frames for Dad. And I have the desk all covered. Great. What are those? Where we're going, it's a little bit of a hike. That is, if you're up for an adventure. Yeah. Come on, it's right this way. I don't want to say are we there yet, but I did. I just did, I guess. We're finally here. Why does this feel so familiar? Take a look. Flynn Castle, Stoney Pass. This is where my family's from. You remembered. Course I did. It was important to you, so it became important to me. Are you sure this is the way we came? That is not the confident answer I was hoping for. I think Rusty should be right over. Oh, no, don't tell me we're... Yeah. I think we're lost. No service. Not to worry, I'm a seasoned traveler. I can find our way back on my handy compass app. Don't suppose it would help if I knew which direction we were lookin' for. That's the family farm. My dad brought me there. To fix it up for your grandpa, I remember. Maybe we should ask someone if they could help us? Or we could go with my instincts. Never steered me wrong. What are your instincts telling you? That we should go with your idea. Hi, me and my friend here got a little lost. Could you point us to the main road? Of course! You're just going to walk straight that way, and the road will be right in front of ya, just past Flynn Castle. That's what I was gonna say. You look familiar, but I can't quite place it. Oh, my dad, Jack, grew up in this house. I'm his daughter, Jenna. I'm Gerald! Jack was my cousin. Really? Come inside! Oh, no, we couldn't. Come and have a quick cup of tea with my wife, Alice. I insist. Okay. We bought the house years ago, after your granddad passed. It felt like home since the first day we moved in. Looks exactly the same. You and your dad did all this? Yeah. Took some time, but he wanted to make sure the house was built well and would stay intact for generations to come. Hard worker, your dad. Even as a kid, he was known as a Jack of all trades, could fix up anything, from a toaster to a bike, to an entire farmhouse. Handy as handy gets. Runs in the family. So you were friends growing up? There was a whole group of us, and every Saturday morning, we went up to Jack's house to hang out together. That's where we met. I think Jack was about 15 at the time, and he said to me, "Gerald, Alice is perfect for you. "You're going to be together forever, "so long as you don't mess it up." It's not quite forever yet, but here we are. Thanks to my dad? Thanks to your dad. No way! I took this photo. We had just finished the renovation. He said it was his favorite project because he had me there to help. I never imagined I'd come back here. I always thought it would be too hard. I probably would have avoided it forever if it wasn't for. You better find a way to come back more often. After all, you're family. I can't wait to come back and hear their stories. There's Trusty Rusty! How convenient, so close to the farmhouse the whole time. What are you implying? That you knew. I don't know what you're talking about. You scratch your head when you're lying. Charlie O'Hanlon, well-known world traveler, never gets lost, especially in his home country. You planned this. I might have known that Gerald and Alice lived there, and I might have nudged us in that direction. Thank you. So you're not upset? No, I'm grateful. I feel more connected to my dad, like he's here with me. What's he thinkin'? That's he's happy we're here together. How's the pitch coming along? Nearly done. You're looking dapper. What's the occasion? What, I can't get dressed up without gettin' the third degree? Jenna, are you coming to the show? That's right, the show. Well, I was just looking for the perfect reason to procrastinate. Thank you all for coming. Like to say a special welcome back to my dad, who's here with us tonight. Please give him a round of applause. Do you know Patrick? You might say that. I think it might be about time for a reunion. Like to play a song for you tonight that we didn't plan on playing. It's a very special song for a very special someone I met a long time ago. 'Twas the mornin', fields were glistenin' Chimes were blowin' in the wind Birds were singin', I was fiddlin' 'Twas a day at O'Hanlon's Inn 'Twas the mornin', you were comin' Never thought my life would change But your smile and your eyes, gentle and wise Always will remain I'm not sure about this. It's gonna be okay. Beautiful night, isn't it? Molly. I was sure I'd never see you again. I always wanted to come back, but life just sent us in opposite directions. Well, I'm glad you did. I love that song, what's it called? It's funny, for years, I couldn't think of a title. Now I think I might finally have an idea. Aren't you gonna tell me? In time, have a little patience. Music shop should be just around the corner. I haven't been here for some time. That it? Yeah, yeah, that's it. Perfect. I'm gonna do some window shopping. All right. Errands complete, ready to head back? I love these rings. Let's go in here before we go home. In here, you want to go in here? Yeah, why not? No reason. Hi. Hello there! Is that Patrick O'Hanlon's son? Hi, Martha, it's good to see you. Old friends? It's a small island. Everyone seems to know everyone around here. How is your dad? He's good, thanks. Same old, really. These are beautiful. Why, thank you. When was the last time I saw you? It must have been when you were in with that ring. The emerald, right? It was her birthstone. Is everything okay? Yeah. We should go, I have to leave soon. Okay. Bye! Does this mean what I think it means? 'Fraid so. Well, you're not going anywhere until you tell me what's wrong. How do you always do that? Well, you're really good at a lot of things. Hiding your feelings isn't one of them. Charlie and I went to Enniskerry. Did you know about the ring? Well, Charlie tells Liam everything, and then Liam tells me everything. Loose Lips Liam. He broke it off with you because he didn't want to stop you living your life. What? He knew that long-distance wouldn't work, and you were so focused on your career. Charlie loved you so much that he didn't want to be the reason why you didn't follow your dreams. So, he let you go. I'm not even sure I know what my dreams are anymore. What do you mean? Ever since being back here, I've felt something again. Home? Maybe I'm overthinking everything. Between things ending with Dave and this pitch, seeing Charlie again. Jenna, years ago, you told me that I would find my perfect career, and I thought that that meant that I'd be in some fancy kitchen in Rome or Vienna, but what it actually meant was something much better. Liam. And maybe the same is true for you. First batch of out-of-towners are arrivin'. Here comes the storm. Quite literally. Looks like a big one is on the way. Welcome to O'Hanlon's. We'll get through this, right? We will, and if we go down... At least we go down tryin'. Well, I guess this is it. Thank you for everything. Likewise. All the best in Dublin. Bye, Liam. This isn't goodbye. Just see you later. Hi. I blew it, didn't I? Not yet. Taxi hasn't gone far. Yeah, you're right. And with an established chain like ours, you know what you're getting, a guaranteed return on your investment. But more important than that, we want to grow and adapt to the culture around us, rather than being just another chain, removed from the community's way of life. And the way to do that successfully is through the people. It's the people, kind, compassionate, friendly Irish staff that will ultimately make each guest experience here so special, and that will be our whole-hearted emphasis if you choose to open one of our hotels here. That is a Pugsley promise. Right, here's the keys. Enjoy your stay at O'Hanlon's. You guys doin' all right? Here, let me bring this out to the guests. You're the best. For you, Rebecca, James. Thank you. Something special for you, Cameron. Thank you. Dad, Molly. You're sure I can't help out, huh? You're really breakin' a sweat out there. I'm doing great. Got the guests checked in, helped with dinner. I see you two have met. Many years ago, actually. 40 to be exact. You're the woman from the photo. Quite the beauty back then, eh? And even more so today. We're going to enjoy the festival together. It's actually where we first met. It's not too late for you. I gotta get back to work. Hey! How did the pitch go? It was phenomenal. Plans are already underway to open a Pugsley in Dublin. That's fantastic news. Listen, I'm at Heuston station. I'm gonna catch the last train back to Dalkey. You're coming back? Let's just say there's one more item on my to-do list. Hi, I'd like to buy a ticket for the next train to Dalkey, please. I'm sorry, that train's been canceled. And unfortunately, it's the last one for the day. And bring the candle inside. Hey, Charlie! You guys have outdone yourselves. With all these volunteers, it's almost like we have a full staff again. You can thank your dad for that. Turns out all you need is a bit of humility. What are you smiling about? Plane ticket, to Columbus for tomorrow night! I can't let her go again. I'll catch you later. Good work, my man! Did we do it? I think we actually did it. You did it. I mostly watched, and sampled. I sampled a lot. This looks absolutely fantastic. Think we're all pretty much prepped for tomorrow, just by the skin of our teeth. And I checked the weather. It's gonna do this all night, but it'll be nothin' but clear skies tomorrow. It's a miracle, we're actually ready for the festival. Thanks to the fine people of Dalkey who helped out in every department. Almost every department. Hi, welcome to O'Hanlon's. Let me get you checked in. Jenna! What are you doing here? It looks a little backed up, can I help? Yeah, please. Hi, I'm Jenna, welcome to O'Hanlon's. Today, we celebrate the rich history of our town. The Heritage Festival has always been a place where friendships, family, and even love can find a place to thrive and grow. And I don't see that changing any time soon. Now, let's celebrate. Charlie, Liam, come on, let's go! Think someone needs a dance partner. This one is called "Jenna's Song." 'Twas the mornin', fields were glistenin' Chimes were blowin' in the wind Birds were singin' Thought of a title. I love it. Do you have to go back to Ohio? What are you proposing? Oh, I don't know. Maybe there's something for you here, something that could help the inn thrive in my father's retirement? I made a deal in Dublin. Congratulations. I'm consulting. But I am looking for a more permanent position. I hear there might be an opening at O'Hanlon's? Have to have a wee talk with the owner. It's gonna be a big change. Are you sure you're ready to take such a leap? In the past, I don't think I would have been, but now, feels like home. I always held onto this. I think something was telling me not to let go. It represents friendship, loyalty, and love. I knew it from the start 'Cause your smile and your eyes Gentle and wise Be still my beating heart I know I'll always love you No matter what you do Whenever I go, wherever you go Forever in my heart RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
