It doesn't look like much but I can tell you it's in top notch mechanical condition. Want to kill it, Mac? Her name's Mackinley. I call her Mac. Excuse me? Typical oakey, all she thinks about is whisky and sad songs. - Got a brain the size of a pea. - 'Listen to her.' You're from-you're from Oklahoma? (Mac) Nashville. Come off it. You know you're from Arizona. Oh, yeah, Arizona? I can tell you that some of the finest guys in my outfit root from Arizona. It's true. [engine revving] [tires screech] (Rafferty) Yeah, I was in the Marine Corp for 20 years. I signed up the day I got outta high school. Me and a bunch of us went to the recruiting office. Most of them stayed in like two, four years but I stayed the whole 20. 20 years. So did you ever shoot anyone? 'No. Once in basic training I shot a guy in the foot.' I never saw any combat duty. They put me into supply. I became a supply sergeant. 20 years, that's pretty near your whole life. Yeah. That's what they call you, life is. So you never really shot anybody? 'No, not on purpose.' 'I spent most of my time just getting drunk, really.' I ended up a gunnery sergeant, that's pretty good. Gunnery sergeant. Gunnery Sergeant Rafferty.

'Then we can go to Flagstaff and drop down to Phoenix.' From Phoenix, pick up 40 and shoot down to San Antonio. Got that? You're not taking me anywhere. I'm pulling off. [gunshot] Don't shoot! You better start sobering up, Gunny. Try that again, and I'll blow your head off. Look at him, big old ex-marine. Hey, don't look so upset. We're gonna teach you okay.

That's of course, you wanted to come with me to Vegas? Las Vegas? 'You're going to Vegas, Gunny?' Yeah, figured there's no point going back to L.A. Probably lost my job. Might as well blow the rest. Yeah. Did you hear that, Fris? Gunny's going to Las Vegas. (Mac) 'What do you think, huh?' [instrumental music] [music continues] Wow, would you look at all this? You ever been to Vegas before?

Denver. - What do you think, am I right? - Don't touch me. And who cares anyway. They're all disgusting. Hey, the man's buying us dinner. Who cares? That means they're still disgusting. That's not a nice attitude. You really gotta learn about life 'cause they're just people. Yeah, if it was up to me, I'd kill 'em all. - Turn them into mud. - Oh, my God. How do you talk like that? That's terrible. I meet lots of people, but I like this crowd. I mean, they're different. This one here gets to travel all over with two pretty girls. - What could be better? - It's not bad. - You know what I mean? - 'Yeah.' That's what you say. Me, I'm different.

Son of a bitch is putting the place on fire to beat the check. Fire! [women screaming] [clattering] [singing in foreign language] [upbeat instrumental music] [singing in foreign language] (Mac) 'What did you say about Vegas? "All they have is hookers'" "'pimps and part-time movie stars." What about Vinnie?' I forgot about pyro-maniacs. Don't touch me. - Don't shoot me, please. - 'Don't worry, it ain't loaded. - How do you know? - 'You wanna see how I know?' Here. That's how I know. Blanks. 'There's nothing but blanks.

'About a week ago.' Well, what for? This and that. Small shit. We were in a daddy tank together. That's where they keep all the lesbians. Why do you stare at me like that for? Shit, Gunny, I'm a woman. [chuckles] We got to talkin'. I told her about me wanting to be a singer. That's the reason I left Tucson in the first place. 'She told me her daddy owns this night club in New Orleans' 'with entertainment, and that I could sing there.' Yeah? 'She wrote to him from jail, told him we were coming.' And you believed her? At the time, yeah. Getting tired though, huh? No, I'm alright. 'Sure, you are.' 'Pull over. Let me drive. The light will drive you crazy.' Okay. Oh. [slow instrumental music] [music continues] How you doin'? You okay? Mm-hmm. Good. I feel very grubby. I look grubby, don't I? - Not to me. - Come on, tell me the truth. I look terrible. No, I gotta stop somewhere and get a shave. Don't you feel dirty? Don't you want to take a bath, and brush your teeth? - I like bad breath. - Yeah? I spent twenty years of my life shaving twice a day and I-I don't know what's happened to me. I gotta stop at a railroad station to find some water. Hey, where's the nearest town with a railroad station? Where are we? Hey. Hey, Fris, you awake? Yeah, I'm awake. And I've been awake. I heard you two last night banging away. Oh, hon', don't give us that hurt, big brown-eyed look. - Yeah, whore. - 'Hey, watch that... ' Shut up. I'm no fifth wheel for nobody. - Pull over. - 'Watch your mouth.' I said, pull over. Pull over, let her get out. Give her, her stuff. God damn it, whore. Nobody, god damn it Nobody fucks me around. God damn whore. Every time in town the boys keep kicking my doll around. 'It makes no difference to me at all.' They only keep kicking my doll around. Well, that was outstanding. What did you do that for? Do what? I just get pissed at her sometimes. She'd be in a little box.. Need a lift, Teddy? How about it? (Frisbee) 'Hey, take off, blimp.' [car honking] (Mac) 'Wait up, Frisbee.' 'Frisbee, we love you.' 'Hey, Fris, I'm sorry.' (Rafferty) Get back in the car, you numb-skull. (Mac) 'Fris. I'm sorry, hon'.' 'Get back in the car.' 'Frisbee, wait up. We love you.' 'I'm gonna run you over, Frisbee.' - Wait a minute. - Hey.

No. Ah, God, she weighs a ton. Stop it. Assholes. - Everybody is. - Get in there. Ouch. I'm sorry, Fris. If I knew you'd be upset. I just got horny. It meant nothing, right Gunny? Yeah. Well, if you two do it again I don't want to be around. You like him, don't you? - Who? - Him. The Gunny? Yeah, don't you? He's okay. He's just along for the ride, and you know that, don't you? He's not at all like us. Come on, get up. Come on. It's time to gas up. Come on. - Come on, Gunny. - Okay. Be quiet, now. Don't say a word. - How do? - Hi there, you got some maps? Inside. You think you could help us get straightened out? - My daddy here filed us up. - Sure, come on in. He's gone. Can we put some gas in? Yeah, help yourself. - Wake up. - It's too early. Quick, stick this in, and watch me. Come on. This the only map you got? Could you show us where we're at? What are you doing? - 'What are you doing?' - 'Just keep goin'.' - 'Huh?' - Just keep going. Oh, yeah, I see. We take 54 down to.. Down from Prescott. We're going over to our aunties for today. Ah, might be staying overnight. Nothing much around to do here in the evening except.. Except what? Except..ah, I don't know. Me and my pretty little sister out there. We know what to do if daddy lets us use the car. You like to party? Sure. I couldn't get of earlier in the afternoon. My boss is the meanest man in town. You could.. Find some Frisbee and you and me could just.. Oh, don't look, honey. You don't wanna embarrass her. [traffic humming] (Frisbee) I put a 1000. Get in. Here you go. 65 cents. See you tonight, Roy. Oh you can't get to heaven on roller skates. You can't get to Heaven on a rocking chair I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more I ain't gonna grieve my Lord no more. She's a hopeless case. My Lord no more. Terminal, terminal condition. (Frisbee) 'You know, I've always wanted to be a singer.' (Rafferty) 'Me too.' (Frisbee) 'Hey, Gunny. Where do you come from anywhere?' Well, I was-I was born in Philadelphia. And I had ah... seven brothers, and four sisters. 'And my father was very close to his brother' 'who lived in Pittsburg. So when I..' 'He and his wife never could have any kids.' So when I was about three and my next oldest brother was four and a half. They decided to send me and my brother to live with him. Cause they're worried about my uncle being lonely. I thought that was a really terrific thing to do. You know, you really gotta care about somebody to give up your own kids so that the rest of your family will be happy. 'I kinda lost contact with him after a while.' 'Every once in while I think I'm gonna go back there 'and say hello, you know, it would be weird.' It would be... it would be strange. Did you ever go to Mexico? No, I was never there. I was at Tijuana once. But they tell me that's really not what Mexico is like. I was there once. It was kinda like.. I knew this guy, animal trainer. He kinda looked like you. - 'What do you mean in Mexico?' - Mexico. 'He was a Mexican.' I would've been a good animal trainer. I had a dog when I was growing up and I got him to jump things. He would jump over fences when we walked down the street. [tires screeching] Hey, Gunny. Slow down. Got a... Well, I got a little problem. The breaks are out. [tires screeching] (Mac) 'It's gonna be okay, Fris.' What's going on, Mary? It's some crazy kids, Fred. Just keep calm. Watch the cliff, Fred. Take it easy. Keep calm and relax. [car honking] [tires screeching] I tell you, Mary. This county's going to hell. That's it. Wheel cylinder's gone. What do you mean, Gunny? Trip's over. Oh, come on, you could fix it. I can't that's a $25 item you're talking about. Now, come on we can just go to town and find a car like this. - 'Oh, yeah?' - Yeah, that's it. - Right. Let's go. - Okay, sure. Come on. Now, let's just go. We can walk it. (Gunny) 'I don't have a good feeling about this.' Go on, Gunny. You can do it. I don't, I don't... have the right tool, really. Well, don't worry about it. (Frisbee) 'Gunny.' (Frisbee) 'Gunny.' My name's Cliff Wilson. I know you people have come here looking for a square deal and I.. I just want to tell you with Cliff Wilson a square deal's what you're gonna get. (Cliff) 'You take for instance this car right over here.' Now, this car was just brought in here yesterday by a lady friend of mine. I want you people to take a peek inside. See how clean she is, huh? (Cliff) 'Also as you can see, she was a religious lady.' 'Come on, senorita, jump inside and I'll take you for a ride.' [instrumental music] Maybe this isn't the car for you people. 'Priced just a little bit outside your pocket.' 'But I got something else just special for you folks.' 'A priest brought it in last Sunday.' (Mac) 'This is my home town.' 'Let's get something to eat.' 'I'll show you around.' 'I want to go see my dad.' Doom and gloom, gloom and doom. What's the matter? What is it with you? You're the most unhappy, you got unhappiness in you for nine people, do you know that? What is it? What's eating you? You silly, stupid thing, you. 'Thousand miles, is that we're gonna look at?' I hate your guts. I can't stand the sight of you. You... ugly, mean.. Ordinary, stupid... fool, you. And don't touch me, do you. Just keep your distance. Keep very far over that side of the car. Meany. (Gunny) 'Look at that hat.' 'I always wanted a hat like that.' - Try it on. - Yeah. Come on. I know these people. Hi, Mr. Staplin. Mackinley Beachwood. - I want to try this hat on. - Help yourself. Oh. - Good looking, huh? - Yeah. It's a Stetson, there it is. Stetson. - Looks good, Gunny. - 'Yeah.' Yeah, handsome, huh? [humming] Yeah, look handsome, huh? How much is it Mr. Staplin? 'Eighteen dollars.' Okay, thanks a lot. Thank you. Thanks anyway, see ya. I'm gonna see my daddy now, Gunny. Check in the Star Motel down the street, I'll see you later. I haven't got money. - You got some money, Fris? - Mm-hm. - Is that my money? - It's anybody's money. - Jesus Christ. - I'll get it. Thanks, Gunny. Get a shave. You look like a porcupine. Bye. Hey! Where is the Star Motel? [dog barking] Excuse me, you got a room? Yeah, I got a room. - 'Can I take a look at one?' - Yeah. - Good. - 'What happened to the door?' Ah, it's just faster this way. Jesus Christ almighty. What's the rate? What do you... 'Three fifty a day. In advance.' You got a weekly or monthly rate? 'No, no, no.' I'm here with my wife. We're kind of on our second honeymoon. 'Yeah.' - We brought our daughter along. - Yeah. 'So we thought we'd take two rooms but we were kind of a.. Oh, you'll like this. You'll like this. Yeah, it's number seven there. 'Can I get a spare bed for my daughter?' Yeah, I'll throw that in. What the hell, whatever. If you lend me a razor, I can shave up. She's got all the stuff with her over where she is. I'll give you 2.65... This is in-in advance. I'll give you 265 now, then I'll shave and then when she comes. She's got 75, 80 cents with her. And we'll probably be staying here for quite a while. Okay, that's alright. Okay. 'Nice and clean. You'll like it.' You seen Beachwood? Boy, some snappy grasser, ain't she? You don't seem so glad to see me? Don't know that I am. The way your dressed like some hippy slut. I didn't come here to argue. I'm on my way to New Orleans. I just wanted to see how you're doing. I'm doing fine, okay. I went by the diner and they told that you'd.. I sold it. Three months ago. Couldn't keep it runnin' myself. Couldn't afford to hire any one. You could've made it a lot easy if you stuck around, Mackinley. And now you got to go hot assing it all over around the country. You're never going to amount to nothing. So just get out of my sight. [guitar music] (male on PA) 'Bus number 14 departing north bound..' (Spanish song) (song continues) (singing continues) Hi. My name is Alan Boone. - 'What's yours?' - Della Rainbow. Della Rainbow. That's a mighty pretty name. - Where you headed to, Della? - New Orleans. New Orleans? Well, I'm from Gulfport, Mississippi. You know, we're practically neighbors. 'I'm goin' up to Fort Riley.' I'm on a fifteen day pass, this here is my last day. I don't usually come up to people and start talking to 'em but do you mind if I tell you something a little personal? You see, I was supposed to get married a week ago last Sunday to Windy Sue Charles, at Baton Rouge Louisiana. - And do you know what? - She stood you up. Yeah, how do you know that? Damn! Excuse me. It's just that.. Well I bought the ring and everything. - You wanna see it? - Sure. It's nice, how much it cost you? It's expensive ring. I was saving the rest of my money, 200 dollar in fact for the honeymoon. Damn her. - Aw, listen, I'm sorry. - It's okay, I understand... It's just that, see Della now, I've been moping around this bus station all day thinking about Wendy Sue. Then I saw you standing here and I thought to myself if I go and talk to a pretty girl like you it might cheer me up, take my mind off of her. 'Hey, Della, you wanna go for a walk?' - I'm kinda tired. - Oh. Well, they might have a cot or something in ladies rooms if you wanna lie down. Good idea, let's take a nap? They don't have no cots in the men's room Della. No, I mean let's take a nap some place together. What'd you mean, like in a park or something? - No, like a hotel. - Like a hotel. [footsteps] It's a little run down, ain't it? Well, we're not gonna live here. [song on radio] - We'd like a room please. - Six dollars a day. - '25 a week.' - Shut up. - Ah! Come on. - Give her the money. It's okay we're married. 'It's okay, honey.' Sign in, solider. [music continues] Hey, you ain't doing this 'cause you feel sorry for me are you, Della? Of course not. [baby crying] N-not so fast, you gotta take it easy. Okay. Boy, you really are fast. Well, ah, you know, I'm just kinda trying to.. - Ah, that's okay, I understand. - Okay. Grab me, go on. Easy, good, that's good. Wow. Yours are just like grape fruits. Wendy just had a little lemons. 'Now, you gotta take your clothes off first.' What? Go ahead, get undressed. Go. [sigh] 'Well, how about you?' You first, I like to watch. Wendy Sue always used to just close her eyes. What for? Shoot, I don't know. I guess, she just wasn't as knowledgeable as you are, Della. You forgot your socks. Alright, get in the closet. - What? The closet? - Uh-huh. - You're teasing, come on. - I'm not teasing. Get in the closet. I wanna pretend like we were married. - Like you and Wendy Sue. - What? I wanna pretend you just came out the bathroom and I'll be under the covers waiting for you. - It's a game I like to play. - Like our wedding night? Yeah. Oh, shoot. [giggles] You know... Yeah, just stay in the closet, please. Peek-a-boo! Yeah, please, just stay in the closet. [chuckling] 'He-he. Della?' Yes? 'Della, you let me know when you're ready now.' Yeah, I will. [chuckling] Jesus, that liar's only got thirty bucks. - 'Della.' - 'Yes?' 'You gonna let me know, Della?' (Della) 'I sure am!' 'I'm waiting for you, Della.' Where'd you go? You're hiding from me. Fine. Della? Shit. Son of a bitch! Oh, that... fucking little thief! Hey Gunny. Hey Gunny. Gunny, wake up. Where's Frisbee? - Frisbee? - Where's Fris? I guess she didn't come back yet. How did it go? - How did what go? - With your father. Not too good, huh? You could say that. Wanna talk about it? Nope. I'm gonna take a bath and go down to Sparkeys. - They let me sing there. - What's Sparkeys? Club I used to hang out at. They got a country band that starts clay hot at six. Oh, man! Wouldn't even know if not for Frisbee. How's that sound? What're you staring at? I can't help it, you got the god damn' display them yourself. - Don't Gunny. - I gotta.. Let go of me. You got me all fired up. Now, don't kid. I'm not kidding. I'm just not in the mood. I gotta clean up. I'm gonna sing. 'Get my hair cleaned.' [sighing] [country music] When my blue moon turns to gold again. When my rainbow turns the clouds away. When my blue moon turns to gold again. You'll be back within my arms to stay. Memories that linger in my heart. Memories that make my heart grow cold. But some day they'll live again sweetheart.. 'Pretty good, huh?' Listen, what time do you want to get out of town tomorrow? Who cares. Who cares. When my blue moon turns to gold again. You'll be back within my arms to stay McKinley Beachwood. Now ain't you a sight. Hi, Billy. How about giving me a little old kiss for old time's sakes? Don't you wish. I'll take a drink though. Well... same old Mac, huh? Where the hell have you been? Here and there. Gunny Raffety. - Pleasure. - 'How are you?' Met him in L.A. He's a marine too. - Are you? - Yeah. Twenty years. Huh. Now, ain't that so? Here's such a man who spent his whole god damn' life in a crutch, comes out without a scratch and here I am. A one-legged motherfucker. Blowdart, two lives. That's a bitch. Yeah, well, who cares? [both laughing] You don't need two legs to eat and sleep and... screw. That's what I do. That's all I do. Ain't that right, Mac? Well, won't you tell him about it? You still pumping gas, Billy? Fuck, no. Are you kidding? I'm an electrician now. Electrician? The pay is pretty good, huh? Yup. Seven dollars and sixty-five cents an hour. I don't know shit about it but I got an uncle in the union. You'll be back within my arms to stay [crowd applauding] Let's have a good time. Well, How are you gonna be home? I'll be right back. [people chattering] Can I just sing a song? You spent 20 years in the marines, huh? - That's right. - Yeah? How the fuck can you spend 20 years in the god damn' marines? 'I hate the fuckin' service.' I hate those assholes, who didn't know their ass from first base, telling me what to do all the time. 'How'd you spend 20 years in it?' 'You're like you wasted your whole god damn' life.' Yeah, I know it. I feel very badly about that. [car engine revving] Now, the first thing. She tells me that she doesn't have any money. And then she tells me that she doesn't have a place to stay at night. Why she... all I was trying to do is help her out. I was just trying to be a nice guy. And what happens? She takes all of my money, she leaves me without a penny. And she even took my fiance's ring. Which was worth a lot of money too. - I thought you were married. - Shut up. And she pulled a knife on me. [country music] Hey, thanks for waiting. Where you been? What's that? - Who're you? - 'The name's Billy.' 'Friend of MacKinley's, he was in the marines too.' You ever shoot anyone? You're god damn' right. I shot any fucking thing that moved. - 'Really?' - That's right. What'd you say your name again was? Frisbee. But mom changed it to Della. Della Rainbow. Della Rainbow. Uh, okay. Tell me something. What's this scoop you have, I mean, you all.. The three of you getting' it on? Or are you.. Well, you fuckin' both of them or what?

Mac's gonna sing in my daddy's night club on Bourbon street. Well, I finished my book. I'm a writer. It's kinda hard to explain. This is our last tune before we go on a break but we've got a surprise for you. This tall drink of water says she's gonna sing for you. Mac's gonna sing? - What's your name again? - McKinley Beachwood. McKinley Beachwood. Let's have a big hand for her! [crowd applauding] [country music] As I sit here tonight. The jukebox playing. A song about the wild side of life. As I listen to the words you are sayin' It brings memories when I was a trusting wife. It wasn't God. Who made honkey tonk angels I'm gonna go get a beer. - Need some money? - Yeah. You wanna dance? - 'No.' - Okay. Wanna shoot some pool? Shoot some pool? What, with you? Eight ball, dollar game. Yeah. Alright. As you said in the words of your song. Too many times married men. Think they're still single. That has caused many of good girls. To go wrong. That has caused many of good girls. To go wrong [crowd applauding] Okay, thank you. We're gonna take a break now. [Dolly Parton singing Jolene] Jolene Jolene Jolene Jolene I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene Jolene Jolene Jolene. Well, that was really terrific. Really good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You liked it? - Yeah. You too. Bravo. Gunny, this is Johnny Young. Hi, how are you? She's really trippy, ain't she? Yeah. Yeah. Here's to you. Me and Johnny got some things we got to talk over. Could-Could you maybe leave us alone for few minutes? Okay.

Where's my money? You mind handing me some of the balls there? [car engine revving] Dammit, I hate being taken like that. Cab driver said he dropped her off at Sparkeys. We'll probably catch up to her there. [crowd cheering] [crowd applauding] You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy. When skies are grey. You'll never know dear. How much I love you. Please don't take. My sunshine away. The other night dear. As I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms. When I awoke then I was mistaken. And I hung my head. And cried [all singing] You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy. When skies are grey. You'll never know dear. How much I love you. Please don't take. My sunshine away. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy. When skies are grey. You'll never know dear. How much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. (Rafferty) 'Hey, alright, come on, sure shot, dammit. God, let us go. Come on.' [crowd applauding] [country music] When I was young and lived along the narrow lake. Washed in the river when the water ran clean. Waiting for the day I could buy me a cadillac. And see a lot of things that I never have seen. Went to the city and I got a little older. And I got a little smarter and I learned good sense. Went back home and I married me a woman. Got a corn land bottom and a barb wire fence. Hey boys you thinking of getting old. Sitting by the fire when the weather gets cold.. Let's-Let's go outside and have a little.. [music continues indistinctly] - Let me talk to you... - Let go of me. - Just leave me alone! - Come here, okay? Help! Gunny! Don't treat me like I was deaf! Gunny! Gunny! Idiot, let go of me! Gunny! (Frisbee) 'Help me! Let me go!' - Leave me alone! - Shut up! (Frisbee) 'Dammit! Gunny!' Get off her, you bastard! [both growling] Leave him alone! (Frisbee) 'Get off him! Stop it!' God damn damn, son of a bitch. (Frisbee) Leave him alone! I'll kill you! Leave him alone. [police siren] It's the cops. Get your ass up. She got a gun! Shoot! Hold it right there! [gunshot] God dammit, shoot! Shoot her! - 'Don't shoot, officer.' - 'Shoot her.' - Don't shoot! - 'She gotta gun.' - 'Don't shoot.' - Dammit, shoot her. Don't shoot. She has blanks in the gun. (Rafferty) 'I'll get her okay? Don't shoot.' Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Don't shoot. Frisbee! Gimme the gun. Hey, gimme the gun. Blanks. There's nothing but blanks in there. She's the one. She's got my ring and my money. Hey, what happened? I don't know. Everybody shooting the shit out of everybody, looks like.. Hmm. Fuck it. (policeman) 'Soldier said you stole $200 and his ring.' 'Let's have it.' What's your name? Where're you from? No. I don't know what her real name is. She calls herself Frisbee. I just met her a couple of days ago. (Mac) Her name's Frisbee. Fris, tell him your real name, honey. Tell him where you're from, Fris. He's a liar. I only took twenty bucks. And I left him his ring and ten bucks. Go on, search him. Bet he's got his money right in his wallet... and a ring. Alright, let's just forget it. Alright, get in the car. - Now, what's your name? - Rita Sykes. - Where're you from? - Tell him, Fris. St. Mary's orphanage in New Orleans. (policeman) 'Another run away.' (Mac) 'Where're you takin' her?' - Back to the orphanage. - Frisbee, don't worry. We'll find some way of straightening everything out. We'll take care of it, honey. Leave it to us. - 'Will see you soon!' - 'Bye, Fris!' [crickets chirping] Do you wanna go with him? He thinks I sing real good. Wants me to sing with his band. I guess that's probably your best bet. Did I tell you that I'm gonna be getting a pension? Starting in March, I'm gonna be getting $285 a month. If you add a job to that, that's.. That's pretty good, you know. Take care of myself pretty well. Maybe even.. Take care of two people. 'Did you care at all?' Gunny, I cared a lot. Okay. - I'll see ya. - Yeah. [engine cranking] [engine revving] Come on, Rita. Come on, come on. [church bell tolling] I can't tell you how happy you've made us, Mr. Sykes. To re-unite Rita with her father.. '...after all these years' 'will help to reaffirm her faith in God.' Of course, the sisters here have become very fond of your daughter through the years. Even after her occasional excursions. And having her back with us at St. Mary's only for a week.. Has certainly made us all very happy. But I'm sure she's in good hands. 'Well, may God be with you both.' - 'So, where to?' - Uruguay. - Uruguay? - Yeah. I got an ex-commanding officer who's got a banana plantation down there. He said if I ever came down, he'd make me foreman. - Uruguay? - Yeah. Uh... Uruguay or Paraguay. We'll find out when we get down there. [car revving] You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy. When skies are grey. You'll never know dear. How much I love you. Please don't take. My sunshine away. The other night dear. As I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you. In my arms. When I awoke then I was mistaken. And I hung my head. And cried I'll always love you. And make you happy. If you will only. Say the same. But if you leave me. To love another. You'll regret. It all someday. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy. When skies are grey. You'll never know dear. How much I love you. Please don't take. My sunshine away
