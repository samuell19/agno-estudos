No! No, you son of a... - Reed! - No! Reed! Reed, no! You, come here! How many more? Is there another team? Will! Will! Leave him alone! Bleed. Now, wait your turn! You like it in there? This is the last place you will ever see. Where is the other squad? There is nobody else. They thought that you... Who? Survivors weren't part of my orders. You wanna live? Who gave us up? Turner! Corporal. Secure the other weapons and let our friends out. Yes, sir. All right, boys, now they know something's wrong. I clicked off 600 meters from the gate when they brought us in. There was a comm cent and a barracks. Give them 15 to arm and rally, 90 to run. And don't forget about the two in the towers. They're not gonna leave their post. That gives us less than two minutes till they're on us. I'll stay with Will, Reed and the prisoner. We need whatever weapons and packs you can find. Rally back here, signal command, and go for the the evac point through there. Copy? Yes, sir. You yell one more time, you go out screaming. Will, you ready? My legs... Sarge, I got no legs right now. You got eyes? Pick up that gun. Yes, sir. Take that ridge line. We'll get the radio back, we'll be out of here in one minute. Atash moves, twitch him. Copy that. I called opp comm, Sergeant. They says it's a negative on the evac. Waiting for further instructions. Let me see it. Opp Comm, this is Sergeant Locke. We have wounded and intel. We request immediate evac at pickup location 1. Over. Sergeant, we have eyes in the sky reporting back the evac zone is too hot for pickup. Stand by for alternate. Copy? We can confirm, enemy operations are down. The area is clear. We do not see or hear friendly choppers. We gotta move now. Hold, Sergeant. We are working on alternate. I repeat: Hold position. Let me speak to the officer in charge. This is First Lieutenant Carpenter. - Sergeant, you have orders... - I said let me speak to the officer in charge. Major Turner. I know he's in the room. - This is Turner. - Major Turner, our situation has changed. After escaping enemy capture, my men and I are proceeding towards evac location 1. We have wounded and a prisoner. It's Atash, sir.- He's alive? Soldier, your orders were to kill on sight. My orders seem a bit conflicted from intel I just received from the hostile. Just as you seem a bit conflicted about our evac. I don't like what you're insinuating, soldier. You'll like it even less when I tell it to ops, brass and straight to your face, sir, but I promise you this: either you send the chopper now, or I cross this desert and come get you. Twelve minutes. Evac confirmed. Zone 1. - Command out. - Copy that. Let's move. I've only been here for a few hours. You know what I realized? Help is a long way away. No. No! No! Staff Sergeant. I read it. What I don't understand is two medals, 14 commendations, the fastest to your rank I've seen... and you want to go with this? Yes, sir. I do, sir. Won't stick. Not enough of it. Not without Atash. And Turner has connections. I know. Every day I wake up... Granted. I thank God. I know he has angels watching over me... and over all my brothers and my sisters.

Thoughts? Wait till it's light outside. Okay. Hey! Roland! Stop! Stop! Stop! What do you think you're doing? You don't skip my class. Not my class. You have three minutes to get back to the center before I call your parents. Go. Kids. You take your eyes off of them for a second, and just chaos. Thank you. Yeah, I'm crazy, and you're kidding kids. - Dang! Marian! - What? - Stop hitting me. - Who are you? - I'm a friend. - I don't know you. If I were trying to hurt you, I'd be swinging, and I wouldn't be wearing a suit. You changed. You haven't. No, not yet. Sent my resumes out. Had a couple interviews. Times have been better. Seems that way. You know, those were serious people you stepped in front of back there. - Not that you're not serious. - Oh. Will you stop complaining? I got you ice cream. I know, I know, I know. Okay? You know, I used to run with my set back in the day. Yeah, I remember. It's the look in their eyes. Fire. Death. It's almost like they want the pain. For you, for them. It doesn't matter. Is that why you left? I couldn't do it to him anymore. I mean, my uncle was staying up late every night. He was wondering if I was gonna come home or if CPD was gonna come knocking on his door and he was gonna have to bury me next to his sister and my father. So I joined up and decided to get an education. And I figured that if something happened on the battlefield, at least I'd die for something. And now you're back. I got that old feeling again, I guess. A soldier can't win if he's fighting for money or power... nothing. I know who those guys were back there. The community center is not a fix, R.J. It's a distraction. Hope, maybe. Roland, the youngest one, when he first came in with his mom to take an art class, I asked him, "Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?" He said he wouldn't live that long. I don't accept that. So those of us who can do, we teach, we take them to museums, take them fishing. Just get 'em out, like you. We can't fight all the gangs, but we can push 'em back a couple blocks and give these kids some room to breathe. Uh, one moment. Did Roland and Eddie make it back? Yes, they did. They're inside. I gotta... But maybe you can come to the center sometime, talk to the kids. I mean, a real army hero like you. They'd love to see that. I'd love to. L.D. on the track. - Cool out. - All right, here we go. - Nappy. - Boom. ♪ ♪ Put your hands down to your side slowly! Where you goin' tonight? Meet some friends, bro? Do white people actually think that sounds okay? Man, answer the question. I'm goin' to the store. - For what? - For juice. Juice? Why you so nervous? I'm nervous? Look, man, I'm just taking a walk. Pull your hood down so we can see your face. I haven't done anything, man. Come on, man. You good? Let's go. I'm sorry, Uncle Richard. Trouble sleeping? A bit, yeah. Take my advice. Don't go out at midnight in this neighborhood. Nothing settling about that. I didn't mean to wake you, worry you, but the cops, they grabbed me and threw me up against a wall for no reason. Dressed like that, I'm not surprised. A young black man in the middle of the night in a hood? They can't tell you from the outlaws around here. You're lucky they "talked" to you. I got away. I don't think they saw me. But when I was running back, there were women and children. In the yards? Gathered by the fences? It's the only safe place. People hear fighting, commotion, they head to the backyard before the shooting starts. They don't want their babies to get hit with a stray bullet. How often is that? That's no way to live. I'm glad you're okay, son. Yeah, about 3:00. Okay. Over here. Further east. There he is. Right there. Stop! Hey! Marian said you were home. I was over at Mrs. Hill's place dropping off her dinner. Poor thing broke her ankle. Mrs. Fitzwalter, it's nice to see you. No, it is nice to see you. And thank you so much for your service. Now where you going looking so good? I have an interview down on 43rd and Newton in 20 minutes. Mr. Gill's place. The accounting job? Well, you tell him that I said you're perfect for it. You know, him and I go way back. It wouldn't hurt. Not at all. And dressed this clean... Honey, you make sure you stop by the block on your way home and maybe I'll take you out to lunch and show you off as my own. - Is your shop still... - On 38th? Mm-hmm. Right next to the community center, and I know you know where that is. Honey, I'm still doing hair, nails and gossipin' from 8:00 to 8:00 every day. Except on Sundays. Gotta give God some of my time. - Yes, you do. - Yes. Well, listen. You go ahead, 'cause you can't be late and expect them folks to hire you. Go on. All right. And listen, tell your uncle I said hello, okay? - Okay. - All right. Mm-mmm! Boy, that apple there sure came from the same fine orchard. Mm! It's light. Nation, you didn't even count it. I don't need to count it to know that you're scared. Sunday. Four. Four? When I sold you the block, you agreed to my terms. Yeah? If you need more enforcers or carriers. Recruit them. Sunday. Four. If you're late, I'll have 10 Kings find you and beat you for two minutes. The other Incas will find you, finish you off, and I'll give them your block. Do you understand? Yes, Nation. Leave. - Hello, everyone. - Hi, Marian. - Got your homework? - Yeah. Good, 'cause you guys are being real nice and you had me scared. I'm like, "Maybe they don't have their homework." - Can I see you, please? - Yeah. Be right back. Bye. Everything with the home... Have you been shot before? Never been shot. You ever lose a friend? It's an interesting feeling. Feel a little conflicted. You just... You know it's part of the job. It was rough. You know, I just, uh... Makes you kind of think how... how fragile life is. You know, he was there in the morning, there with me when we left, and then he was gone. All right, girls, let's go. Be good, girls. Great job today. Good night. Marian, thank you. No, thank you for coming... No, no. Those kids are amazing. They teach you. They asked me questions I've never even thought of. So maybe you'll come back. Definitely. Yeah.

I give you the gun. You protect the block, eh? Because two blocks away from here, they're robbing me blind. Mira. What did you see? Don't play with me. I'm not playing with you. What did you hear? You can't use your eyes. Close them. Hey. You look exhausted. They took my blood, my piss and my pants. When you let 'em take your pants, it's 'cause you ain't goin anywhere for a while. I thought I lost you out there tonight. No, son. I'm with you. - I'm with you. - Sorry. The doctor had me give him something to help him sleep. No, it's okay. He needs his rest. Thank you for being with him. Your father's a good man. Yeah. He is. So you said you found the money right there at the door? Yeah, I find it when I open the door. Okay. Did you see anybody walking around the neighborhood or anything like that? Was like 6'2", something like me. Nobody... Any guy with a hood on? Maybe possibly a tall guy? Well, this is a surprise. People waiting to get in here. Problem is, we're too old to learn anything. Alderman Lackland, this is... The lady and I have met. Alderman Lackland. Marian. John. Please, both of you call me John. We're family here. Besides, I'm not that old. John has been one of the center's biggest supporters. Made it a big issue in his last campaign and helped get the doors open. You want to tend to the families, you have to take care of the neighborhood, watch the children. We can't have this mess like we did last night. No one's safe. Did they say what caused it? Not what. Who. Some banger in a hood. Rival gang. Maybe Deuces. Held up a corner enforcer. Took the money, the drugs. Big score. Killed a couple of Latin Kings in the shootout, I heard. Terrible. I know. They'll find him. You don't come into Kings land and raid the hens without someone having to pay. I talked to the precinct, uh, Sheriff Brewer. They're gonna add some presence around here until he's caught or the Kings kill him. I should go. Push my soapbox somewhere else. John, thank you for coming. - Always welcome. - Least I could do. You tell your mother I said hello. I'll do that. R.J.? I'll pray for your uncle. Thank you, sir. John. Thank you, John. R.J., I'm so sorry. How's he doing? It's his heart more than anything. Years of high blood pressure, and it finally caught up to him. Are you going down there? I could get someone to... No. I'm just gonna let him rest. I was actually hoping you'd let me hang out here for a bit. Sure. Of course. I don't know how many kids we'll be having today. Oh, my Lord. Oh... Man, this ain't nothing like no Wu-Tang, man. It's not. Martial arts is just that... art. Control your breathing, control your body, control your mind. Maybe your life. Millions of people all over the world practice this every day to help them stay in shape, to help them relax. But most importantly, to help them focus. R.J., when you get a chance, I need to talk to you. Okay. All right, guys. Five on five. I'll be back. This is unbelievable. Terry, Jessie's mom, said that she found $100 in her mailbox. People are finding money in their homes, stores. He must have had to dump it before he left the block. What makes you think he dumped it? You don't steal $7,500 from the Latin Kings and just gift it to people like Santa Claus. What if somebody did? Well, then he can do it again tonight. It'll definitely keep this place open another three months. Mm. Roland stopped by about an hour ago. Said your uncle was helping him escape from the shooters when he collapsed. Thinks it's all his fault. You want me to talk to him? I don't think he wants to see you right now. I think he's ashamed. Where is he? I sent him to get the devil scared out of him. Strive for peace with everyone... and for that holiness without which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one be deprived the grace of God, that no bitter root spring up and cause trouble... through which... many may become defiled. Don't do it, Roland. The Lord is my helper, and I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me? Nothing. Don't turn away from the Lord. Roland, his plan and design for your life is... Don't turn away from God. - Amen. - Amen. - Say it again. - Amen. Amen. So... Get on outta here before your mama worries some more. See you on Sunday. Can I help you? No, I'm good. Are you? Now, unlike some priests, I don't take too kindly to strangers putting their hands on little boys. Now I know you're not his father, so I'm gonna ask you again. Can I help you? Uh, I'm sorry. I met Roland at the community center. He was in an incident last night. - Hmm. - He was with my Uncle Richard. Oh. You're Richard King's boy. Yes, sir. Sorry. It's all right, Father... Tuck. Benjamin Tuck. Father Tuck. If you don't mind my asking, Roland was a little upset. What'd you say to him? Same thing I say to all of them. "God has a plan for your life, which is why you're still here." You know, that was two different Bible verses you quoted back there, right? Yeah. Yeah, I did forget. But... I thought I saved it. Do you believe it? That little boy was shot six times last summer, and he's still with us. So if God's not watching over him, he's not watching over any of us. Amen. You don't have to say that just for me. I was the reason my uncle was out last night. He was looking for me. Making sure I was okay. Yeah. I'm sorry about what happened. He was here with us first, right here in this church. Yeah. Few of us get together three times a week. We pretend it's about the budget or the choir, but it's really so that... they don't know what we're talking about. Our lives are not our own. Fear's dictating everything. These kids are dealing with drug dealers and gangs and... This is our neighborhood. And we don't have a say. It's not your fault, what happened with your uncle. I've known that man for 27 years. That was his choice. And you know what I think? I think he wishes he could have done more. I think he wishes it was him in that hoodie, putting the fear into the hearts of those bastards. Yeah. I know about that too. Yeah. I mean, God bless him. God bless anybody who's gonna stand up, even for one night. You got me all riled up here. I need to go get some Pepto or something. Keep 'em running. Hey, how you doin', man? Got somethin' for me, man? Hey, man, pull your pants up. Damn! All right, he ran right there. He ran right there. Aaah! You're not afraid? Of you? No, ese. I don't want to hurt you. Just give me the money and the drugs. Can't do that, man. You see, out here, this is life. You take it. Inca, casinca, they punish me. I fight you, I might win. Either way, I take a beating. Stop. Just stop. Here and now. Why the hell should I listen to anything you have to say, bro? 'Cause I'm not your enemy, and I'm not going anywhere. You think just 'cause you steal from a couple of enforcers that you run Kings town, hmm? No. And I don't want to. You started this life for... your brothers. Now you're as scared of them as you are of me. Why do you continue? Money? What if I paid you? Come work for me. Take these streets back. Give it to them. You can't. You're just... One man taking the streets by force? How do you think this all started? Just one. What you want from me? Hmm? Nothing. Just watch. If I'm wrong, what do you lose? But if I'm right, we take Kings town and give it back to them. You still get your money and nobody beats you. Tell them it was a good fight. Think about what I said. - Sorry. - You will be. Vatos locos! Wait, wait, wait. It was an accident. No. See, an accident is when someone gets hurt for no reason. I'm gonna beat you senseless for causing trouble in my backyard. Good. That makes it more fun. No! No! Juanito, you promised. You gave me your word. Ma, I told you I wouldn't fight. But the fight, it comes to me. He's the one been running around stealing. Casinca is looking for him. He finds him here, it's bad for all of us. You used to run with the Kings? But no more? No. No more. I used to be out there too. A long time ago. But now, I just want this off the streets. I want the same thing you want for your son. For them. These people will never know peace as long as this is out here. Man, go! Get out of here, before I change my mind. Juanito, I need your help. Tell me who runs the Kings. Tell me how, and I'll take them down. Take them down! You're just... He wants to help. When you told Inca you wanted out, did anyone help you? No! Now they follow you in the street like you are a dog, an enemy. Ma! I... You promised me, Juanito, and you promised your kids. Now you tell him what he wants to know. Juanito. Doesn't that mean Little John? When you pick a fight with more than one guy, what do you do? Pick the biggest guy, drop him. The rest will run. Exactly. Kings have hundreds of soldiers. They recruit them. Familia that comes up from Mexico, new immigrants. But they're followers. Most don't speak English and aren't hard from the life yet. They just need a place to sleep, something to eat. Then you have the enforcers. They stand watch. They have the guns on the block. Above them, the casincas hand them the weapons and drugs. It's like a snake with food. It rides all the way up and down. The block, that's owned by the Inca. He's been around a while, and he won't go quietly. He paid for the block. He gives the soldiers a home. Pays the supplier and Nation. Nation? Nation owns Crown Town. You have all these blocks run by the Incas, but Nation runs it all. And he don't care. You pay... or you die. You recruit... or you get beat. Twelve vatos every month. Replace the old ones, those that ran or muerto. How do I find Nation? Show him he's lost something. He will find you. I can't run with no one anymore. Not even you. Protect your family, Juan. When I come stir the nest, they'll come to the blocks looking for me. They're scared. But if you help the people, show them the way, take care of them... they will stand up. You go after Nation... I'll fight with you too. So what's next?

Don't get me wrong. We're grateful for the money. You are definitely doing God's work, but unless you have more from where that comes, and plan on opening a proper grocery store, our people are still gonna starve in this food desert. Gotta walk three miles in each direction to get fresh produce. Old folks, mothers with young children, they can't walk that far. Sure, they can go to a quick mart or a liquor store to get staples, but that's not real food. Where are you going? To find a caravan. That can't hurt. You won't be needing that, my friend. Friend? What friend? You jacked my truck. A friend only takes what's necessary. He spares your truck and he spares your life. And a friend... Pays you for your troubles. Why would you rob me and pay me? We're not robbing you. - We're robbing them. - Of the food. Your truck will be delivered to a safe spot as soon as we take everything that we need. Now, put this on. You're gonna count to 100, then walk back to the truck depot. Uh-uh. No peeking. It's safer for you, and it's much safer for us. Thank you. It only takes a few minutes. If the conversion works, your heart will be back in rhythm. That's right. There's nothing to worry about. We do this every day. And if your heart stays in rhythm, and you start feeling better, in three or four days, we'll start talking about going home. Hello. Thank you for the donation. My pleasure. Hello. I, um... I'm not really sure how this is supposed to work, but, um, you wanna help me out here? I fee... feel a little stupid. You talk. We listen. And, hopefully, provide. "We"? So there's more than one of you now. Okay. So you're not really chatty. So how about we talk about rituals and sacrifice? Your news at 6:00 starts right now with more reports of the hooded vigilante in Chicago. ♪ Most of my life I been dealin' with struggle ♪ His victims this time, a series of local grocery stores and their food supply trucks. Apparently, only the food was stolen, and the trucks were recovered empty just a few hours later. No one knows what happened to the trucks' contents, but a motivation seems to be emerging in the case. In a handwritten note left at one scene, The Hood, as he has been called, asks a local food chain operator to open stores in select neighborhoods. The Hood also claims in that note that the robberies will end only when the new store construction begins. ♪ If I lose focus, I might miss my plane ♪ ♪ I done made that mistake ♪ ♪ But I ain't makin' it again ♪ ♪ Make it through the struggle ♪ ♪ And put my back to the wind ♪ ♪ Back in the struggle ♪ ♪ I can make it through it ♪ ♪ Got my eyes wide open ♪ ♪ Come on, let's do this ♪ ♪ Life is a struggle ♪ - Get up outta here, man! - Go!

Oh, well, you know, when money is involved, some things have to be put aside. Go and enjoy yourself. I think I will. Good seeing you. Rosa! I'm sleeping! I said I'm slee... You said we could trust you. That we were brothers. Carnales. Do you remember? But nobody's seen you for two weeks. There's trouble, and you run. You turned your back on us. That's not what you promised me. That's not what I paid you for. All these years, when you had nothing, Nation takes care of you. So I see that you need to be reminded. You need me to remind you of your business. See, if your family cannot trust you... maybe you don't deserve any family. One chance is all I promised you. Your life belongs to me. If you cannot pay, she will. You understand? Yes. Yes, what? Yes, Nation. Good boy. Get him dressed. All of them. You go door to door. Anyone who's left, if they're not there, you wait for them. - You understand? - Yes, Nation. Evening. - They're with me. - And you are? On the job. Picking up a man, following a lead. On The Hood? All right. Do what you do. - Be safe. - You too. You okay? Forty-two, Alan. Kings dragged 42 from their homes last night. Are they... Nobody knows. They don't even know if that's all of them. Some of these kids are staying with their families illegally. They're not just gonna report them missing to the authorities. You know, it might be time to work with the police. Are you serious? R.J., Will saw more patrols out there last night. I mean, these guys are armed on every single corner out there. But these cops, they're just chasing shadows out there. We could show them what we've got. That way they have less shadows to chase. I know that look. Where you going? To make more arrows. ♪ The Kings are fighting back. - They're taking kids. - I know. You cut off his recruiting and... took his supply and his cash flow. He'll need a quick score. Nation? Yeah. Save as many as you can. If he's gonna go down, he's gonna take whoever he can with him. R.J.? I'm with you. Whatever you need. ♪ - You dropped something. - Hey, wait. Yeah. I can hear you, man. I'm going after Nation tonight. I can get them back. You want us to come with you? No. If he's holed up, it'll be dangerous. No matter what happens, stay inside. I need the yards and the streets clear. Can you spread the word? Sí. I'm sorry, John. I didn't realize anyone else was here. Tough night, Benjamin. Yes, it is, but... we will get through. With prayer? And faith. That's right. No. I'm worried this time that's not enough. God helps those who help themselves. It is a dangerous thing to put our faith in man. It is. John, what did you do? What needed doing, Benjamin. One moment. - Who is it? - Sheriff's department. I'm sorry, I have to see ID. What's this concerning? It's a neighborhood matter. Some trouble with the gangs. Oh, my God. Is it Roland? No! Mama! What is this? This is about your boyfriend in a hood stealing my money. Why? I don't like deals, Ben. It's part of the job. Nation is crazy. He will tear this neighborhood apart, and you know this, you have seen this. Perhaps he will. But that's part of the purge. Worse a neighborhood gets, the more funding it gets. Hell, developers love to come in and "save" a neighborhood in peril. I can control Nation as long as he gets his money. R.J.? The idea of a man in a hood protecting people, stealing from the gangs, giving to the poor. That's not reality. How's that for reality? Or should I fully whip your ass? No. I feel you. Gentlemen? And I admire your faith. I do. But you should know... your divine purpose is how it all ends tonight. I knew you couldn't resist. I trusted you to lay it all at my doorstep, and you did. But now, you're unnecessary. Let's go. Let's go. Wait. What? Breech. They captured 42 last night. The house is virtually unguarded. It's a setup. So, if we're chasing, where are they? They know. We gotta go. You take 58th. You take Western. We gotta rally the guys at the roof. We gotta go back to the warehouse. - All right? - All right. Let's go. Coward. Afraid to fight. John, prince of the city. You can't even do it yourself. Not my style. Don't want the hands dirty. Robin! Robin! Just get this car out of here. You do it right now. Do it. Right now. Get outta here. Come on out. I know you're there. Same team. Same team. Kings have been up and down the block all night. We were wondering when you were gonna show up. We're here now. What can we do to help? We? There's more of us around. How many? Enough. 'Cause I think they're taking more hostages tonight. Saw 'em in an SUV with a woman about 10 minutes ago. Fully strapped. We're gonna need backup. Which way? There. We'll handle it. If you can, protect the block. We'll send more people later. You know... I was wondering whether we were gonna get a chance to meet. Now, I must admit, I had something else in mind, but you know what? This will do. This will do just fine. You make them think they got a choice. That they can say no. That they can take my money. That's stealing. You stole from me. But despite your crimes, you got it easy. Tuck? Marian? Mmm. Your men, well, with you gone, they'll run, they'll die... makes no difference to me. Go ahead. Do it! No, no, no, no, no. Nation está aquí. - You saved me. - They saved both of us. I'm Robin. Thank you. No. You save us. You protect our streets. You fight for us. Ow. - Ow! - All right, man up! It's already turning. Cleaned it out the best they could with what they had. Yeah, you're lucky to be here. Not luck. Him. Nation, he's a sheriff. Men, badges, everything. I'm thinking ex-military too. He knew exactly how we were gonna respond. He knew where to lead us and how to hurt us. So what do we do? I don't know. And he has Marian. Tuck? Dead. Hit him at the church. They hit the warehouse too. It's all gone. Money, weapons, evidence. Marian? Right out of her apartment. I'm sorry. Okay. They know about me. But they have no idea how many of you guys there are. So we have two options. Either... One. Save your breath. We finish this. What are you doing? You can't rob a hospital in a flak vest. Give me your shirt. I'd almost given up on you. Sit down, sit down. He's resting. I gave him a little something to help him sleep through the night. You won't wake him. What do you mean you gave him something? Well, I had the nurse. Oh, don't. They'll arrest you. Nation kills Marian. Sit down! I said he'll be fine. For a soldier, you have a bit of trouble sticking to the mission. Should have been killed at the house. All of you. Cleaner that way. None of these ends to deal with. But... if that's the way it goes, I'm here to play along. You won't win, you know. You'll try because that's your way. In the end, there's just too many of them, no matter how good you think you are. Maybe there's another possibility. And that's why you're here. That's what I do. I facilitate what needs to take place. Now, Nation has a business he would like to continue running. You have people you care about and would like to see breathing. What do you get? I get to keep spinning the plates, of course. And to see that my people and this neighborhood get what they want... what they deserve. They don't have the fight in them anymore, R.J. They're tired, weak, beat down. What's the best you can offer them? Another war? Who will survive? Who can you protect? Take Richard with you. I can get the girl back. Isn't that what really matters? You're young. Don't die for this. Be a shame. Come on. Get in there. Get in there. - They're moving her. - Yeah. Their best hope is to keep her on the road like they do with their shipments. We can't do a one rush on their location. There's no beating them. Only him. Where? He loosened his grip on the blocks, and I'm guessing he's gonna wanna take that back. So we're talking 47th. So, cover is... No. No more hiding. Not for me. We need to hit them where they live and breathe. For them, that's drugs and money. We need information. And then... faith. Brilliant. Keep the lab mobile. You can create and cut the products anywhere it needs to be distributed. What's that, seven, eight muffins? I don't care anymore. You don't even add anymore. You multiply. Oh, this close to retirement, you think I gotta worry? That's a lot of muffins. Don't move. - I got something for you guys. - Oh, yeah? What's that? - The end. - The end? The end to what? All this. Whoa! Hey. What? What's that? Track it. Follow it to the source. The drugs. The lab. Bring everybody you got. 'Cause they're not gonna stop unless you make 'em. - Freeze! - Don't. Stop. Hold it right there. Who are you? Why are you doing this? I'm just a kid from the block who's seen and had enough. I can. So I have to. Dispatch, I have something. I'm gonna need detective assistance. Copy that. Ahh. What are the odds of that? We locked down? Chained to the bed. Copy that. Aaah! Now why would you want to go and do that? You just made this an unfair fight. Did I? You were right. This block isn't big enough for the two of us. Seven in custody now. Officers in foot pursuit of two more men on Harlem near the underpass. Units 9 and 14, please re-route to Harlem and 78th near the underpass. You're done. Suspects from narcotics vehicles... Your supply's gone. I'm gonna cut it out of you. Every piece that you took from me. This is my block. No. It's theirs. And when we're done, we'll let them decide. How you feeling, hero? Oh, hell! Get the girl. No! No! Get up. Get up. I told you. I told you. My block. Not enough room... for the two of us. Piece by piece. Hold it right there! Put it down, son. You don't know what you're doing. You're just gonna get hurt, go to jail. You put it down, or your life is over! I mean, who are they gonna believe? You? Honestly. No, John, no. They'll believe him. And, John, you'll pay. For all you've done. I'll make sure. Richard. I... You don't understand. I do. Perfectly. You sold us out, had your friend killed. And for what? Money? Power? All I ever wanted... was to provide for my... Enough, John. Enough. You make me sick. Take one more step, Richard, and I'll cut her wide open. You got him? Got him. He moves again, put two in his eyes. But you won't move, will you, John? Because you're out of moves. And snakes can't stand up, can they? You got enough? Absolutely. Yeah. Everybody has that moment... when the grass ain't as green as they thought it was and... they wish that they could go back and make the other choice. This is my moment.
