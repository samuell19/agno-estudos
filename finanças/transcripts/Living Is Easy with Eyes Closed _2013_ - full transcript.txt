When I was younger, much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help in any way. But now these days are gone. I'm not so self-assured. Now I find I've changed my mind. Contraction... I have changed. "Now I notice that I've changed, I opened the door. " Still, Pav?n. Help me if you can, I'm feeling down. And I do appreciate you being around. Help me get my feet back on the ground. It's not mine, really. What are you doing here? Who has taken you out of class, eh? Who has taken you out of class, eh? See you at the office. What do you think this song means? Pajuelo. To ask for help? Man, we already know that, right? It is titled Help! But really, what is it talking about? Quinito. It's someone who's asking for help because he's grown old. Speaking of success. Loneliness and success. Why would someone ask for help who sells thousands of records, and performs in front of thousands of people? Ugena? Why would they want to go back to normal? I dunno. To have friends you trust? To spend money, to party. And why not the reverse? Maybe having money is not enough for him to be happy and partying. What John Lennon shouts to us is: Help!" Help! - Everybody together. - Help! Where's my girl? Have you seen my baby? - I haven't seen anyone. - You haven't seen her? They have it here, let me see. Tell them to let me see. - Let go, you're hurting me. - You do will do the same. Tell them to give me my baby. Please, please... No! Don't go, please help me! You gotta help! Please don't go! Please...! - Please. - What are you doing here? How many times do I have to say I never want to see you here? Should I call the police? Do you want me to tell them everything? Get out of here! We haven't helped enough, or what? What's up? Calm down, Mrs. Mercedes. Ande, we were inside just now. Come, help your brothers to set the table, you thug. - Perfect. - We are, Pablo? We are, now. Ah, what a relief. Javi, take off the mask. Let's eat. But what if there's a poison gas attack? What gas attack! Come on. Call your brother. Juanjo, eat!

Although he broke his arm, He was able to steal a bike... Mom, why does Pablo always come back from the hairdresser with rice pudding? - Not always. - Always. Can't you see that the elderly have bad teeth? This doesn't take much to chew. Look. See if I have teeth. Can you stop speaking nonsense? Don't you love rice pudding? She cares for you, Mom. - Well that's wonderful. - Of course, but now we must serve and eat. Who am I after? First is Juanjo, which is what more work will give you, with these matted... I don't think I want it cut. Certainly. Let me just give you a little... I already told you I don't want it cut. If you want I can give you my headband. No razor sharp metals. Got it? Shut up, dwarf. A little bit more? Here, give me the plate. I won't drop it. When they return from school, it's first come first serve. Thank you. What can the bomb are giving this, or that it killed someone... Events such as the bomb accident in Palomares, Almeria have been surpassed by... But it's nuclear... If they do it for the tourism. If foreigners stop coming, tell me what is left here. Like Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These bombs were training. A singular contribution to bathroom trusted with the minister... Come, give me the TV. Go, you two. Pablo, ask me whatever you want about the multiplication tables. Three times six? Eighteen. Leave him to it. Nine times eight? - Fifty-four. - Seventy-two, dummy. You want to shut up and let me hear this? Pablo, my darling, Sunday we have the christening. We're going to go as movie stars. All of us. Mom, I don't want to cut it. Come on, man, it's easier if you go along. It's like if you removed a weight, like a helmet. No, dad, my hair is mine and I'll do what I want with it. Come on, man. Up next Pablo home to do us the favour. Did I ever tell you that it was thanks to him that I met your mother? It was after the war, when I was assigned to Girona... A thousand times, Dad. Well, you won't cut it and that's that. And there's that. You take its course. I don't talk like that. As back tonight and don't have the will have cut the brown. Hurry, come. Shut up and eat. Here, for disobedience. I shit on you... holy hell. Come on, quick. I go to my little step. Ask me the multiplication table. If you know you the. I have to go. Come up alone. Aren't you coming to dinner? Of course, come to dinner. Come on, go. Fast. I saw him do was El Santo. - You won't say anything. - Are you going to go home? That seems. They say that the jumps are bad. Better to lose a lifetime thinking that's out there. Are you crazy? You cannot do that. And what will you do better? - I'm not doing anything. - Ah, no? And why are you here? What's up? Josephine, who has sprained his ankle. You are taking too much weight and ankles are the ones who suffer most. Come in, refreshing. I can leave a little while later buy pipes? It will be true about cravings. To this you fancy pipes all the time. And I croquettes. Yesterday I ate sixty-two. But what you're gross, daughter. They were teeny. Tomorrow go out with me, but before you pick up that hair a little. You know that pretty girls you must exercise caution. I talked to your mom last night. I told him to come see you the day you want. And you're you and you believe it. I can? Don't get mad, woman. You want to accompany you? Where are you alone? You give me pipes? Radio Luxembourg the station of the stars transmitting in the 208 meters on medium wave. And we continue with the best music, Now the last Beatles album. John? San Antonio Román. Anthony. San Román. I was so full? Yes, thank you. You all right? I've heard her vomit. It's nothing, dizziness. Thank you. You want some candy? For the taste. They are cough, but they serve well. The classroom use. I'm a teacher and throat... - Don't you go put driving now? - Not. - I accompanied someone? - No, well, I brought a man. I brought a gentleman. What are you, driver? No. You are hitchhiking? Where are you going? - To Málaga. - I'm going to Almeria. If you come right... Who brought you? One? I prefer not to continue with it, really. All he does is talk about his wife, who has died recently. He says he appears. Let's do something. I start the car and you're getting into in a jump. My car isn't much, but I don't think of anyone listed. You sure? See if angry. And we kill the two? As the woman? For sure he killed him. Come on. Ready? Crouch, who are there civil guards. Now fined the hitchhikers with two hard. And the lord of before? You, your parents didn't tell you never to get into a car with strangers? And you? Me, what? I'm not a stranger. - Antonio, English teacher. - Belén. Hey, girl, loose, I'm driving. Every day we talk more in English: Okay, hobby, sweater... America today is like ancient Rome. Sure your boyfriend to flirt I will put you in playboy plan. - I don't have a boyfriend. - What? - Have you been living among the blind? - No. You not having a boyfriend is like the Eiffel Tower not having tourists. Sure, you had one and left him. More or less. Look. Here I have a map. Look to see where you better let you go. I'm a geography fish. Anywhere is fine with me. Almería is going well, if you want. The Yellowhammer. The lads call the Geography teacher Yellowhammer, because he is very tall, very thin, and has a very fat head... And me, do you know what they call me? Come on, see if you can guess. No idea. I'm not going to say. Guess. I dunno. The bald? The chubby? The four eyes? Hey, you, enough, I see that you are motivated. It's not mine, really. First, let me. This opportunity... The reason for my visit... I'm a teacher... and... Well, my students... You know, John? Your lyrics are important. You have to talk to the rest of the group. You're talking to yourself. I was thinking. - And you think in English? - No! Hey, a 'Beatle'. A "Beatle"? The hair, yeah, the kid... You don't care, right? Come to Almeria you do well? Yes. Come on. Well let's go, rises. Hello. Antonio, Belén... And you? Juanjo. Hello, Juanjo. Move those things out of the way, those are the boys'. Well, now you're asking yourselves if I have kids and stuff, right? To be companions I've searched. What if I have children? No, I have no children. It's the kids I coach. Football. You like football? Yeah, I used to like it. "Used to like it. " As if it's a thing from your youth. - How old are you? - Sixteen. And you left school? More or less. More or less? Good answer. Well, I'm more or less a Professor of English and Latin. And although they seem like two different things, they actually have much in common. Why do you think... the English word for table is "table"? Because it comes from the Latin tabula. Tabula. Table. My students love to study English, but they say that learning Latin is useless. And you know what I say? Your grandfather is also old and useless, but you wouldn't be here without him. Do you have more of that candy? You tides? No, I have the guts revolt. Am I'm going too fast? This is a fireball. It's actually my father's. In the village and uses and he lent it on the condition that I go to see them more often. This is your father? My father, my mother and my brothers. Eight? What a beast. My parents don't like to play cards. Now I get it. Don't worry, I'll speak more slowly, so you understand everything. This is you. No, no thanks. No, no, Keep them. I have many at home. Is that always fails the voice and... So I try not to talk too much. Yeah. I've noticed. Very funny. I mean, if it weren't for the voice, I would have liked to sing. But in Spain, go figure. You like the Beatles? Yes. And you? Well, I dunno. I prefer The Rolling Stones or The Kinks. Ah, no, no. You get out of my car. A guy who despises The Beatles my car does not go anywhere. Come on, get out now. Sorry, there you've touched my weak point. Come on. Out of my car. Antonio, no big deal. No? Would like it if I insulted your friend? Or your boyfriend? Or, I don't know, your favourite actor? Who is your favourite actor? Marlon Brando. You would like me to say Marlon Brando is a pussy? I haven't insulted anyone, I just said that... You get out of my car. In my car The Beatles are respected. I think you're overreacting. Well, this is my car and in my car I'm in charge. - Then I'm getting out too. - Well let's go. Come on. Let's go. Get Mick Jagger to take you. You both believed it? I Want Candy. Actually I'm going on this trip for the Beatles. You could meet Lennon. Really? I'll talk to him. Not a problem. - He's shooting in Almeria. - Actually, I'll scold him. But they'll let you see him? He is very protected. And what would you do with these hysterical? If you throw up underwear and throw it on stage. It must be something terrible, no? Going out to sing and see all those crazy screaming... Isn't that what they want? I assure you that's not what Lennon wants. At the concert in Spain he said that what bothered him... was best seats filled with government people, and outside the police clubbing the boys at the door of The Sales. My father was there. Oh? Giving blows. It is gray. In England they say they're breaking up. What happened is that John wants to do other things: writing, working as an actor. And it does wrong. Have you seen A Night Of A Hard Day? - Yes. - No? Actually it's mistranslated. Because in English it's an incorrect sentence, a solecism. You don't know what they're talking about. but amounts to a syntax error. John Ringo heard it: "It's been a hard day's night". I would rather say "The night of a lousy day. " It's not the same. And it sounds worse. So, now you're English teachers? Ignorance is very bold. You know the story of Menéndez Pelayo? Well, look. He was giving a lecture and named Shakespeare, but he uttered "Saquespeare". And people laughed at him. You know what he did? He ended the conference in English. Which country. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Homemade meals I prepared myself. And you're not married? I dunno. Teachers, both dealing with children, we end up not understanding the adult world. No, no, you eat them. Come on, slowpoke, you're growing. Come on. Also, I don't need me. This one thought in school I was called "chubby". And what are you called? - See if you can guess. - "Bald" because I said so. My mother gets them chopped onion. Less for my sister, who hates onions. - How many siblings? - Six. Three boys and three girls. Good, the two have a lot of brothers. And you? I am alone. And now will you tell me what the hell you two are doing on the road. You're to something for sure, I bet. No? I'm going back to Malaga to my mother's house. And you? But it says. Why have you run away from home? - And the house of a policeman. - I didn't run away. My parents know. You get along with your parents? There, there, good question. My father is an asshole. But they're good people. - And you left school? - I don't know. Well, I'm going to pack up. I'll help. You think they will let him see Lennon? Are you crazy? Luck will go as far. For he is convinced. No thanks. You don't have a cigarette? I don't smoke. See, silent children. Male. It's humid. That's because we're near the sea. Look. "Almeria. "Capital of esparto, snot and gummy. " Has to be the next town. It's before you get a little apart, near the sea. They told me on the phone. But if I had known there is pending... In heated rises much and better safe. And how long are you staying? Tomorrow I'll be back as soon as I speak with him. I cannot miss a day of class. I had to lie to Don Paco. Who is Don Paco? The head teacher. If you learn what I have come, sure makes me angry and slaps as it does with the boys. He spent ten years in the missions and there it is customary to drop a lot of wax. A classmate, teacher broke her eardrum from a slap. A teacher? I thought women were more sensitive. Yeah, sure. I had a nun we took from here and when you couldn't take any more she was bashing your face with both hands like she was playing the cymbals. So you went to the nuns, eh? Yeah, I can see you with the nuns. The Herrerianas of Malaga. We called them the Terrorianas. - And you study with the priests? - My parents had it easy. The worst school in Madrid was near home. Madrid overwhelms me. Since I finished the race I must have been four or five times. It's always seemed to me inhuman largest city. I'm more Machado, walking around outside. "In the distant mountains there are gold and blood. The sun died. "What you seek, poet, in the sunset?" Take that! Every night before bed, I read a poem. It is a way to shake dirt of the day, like a shower. And you'll learn the memory? Memory is a muscle. If you don't exercise it, it atrophies. Well, push the memory that I can no more. Come on, come on. We must seize the momentum. By Newton. Come on. Come on. - You forgot your bag. - It's true. Good. - Good luck and thanks for everything. - You too, Juanjo. - I'm good, eh? - Yes. - Goodbye. - Not if I'm going too. Cool off a bit in the hotel, if you want. While, I'll have a coffee there. Okay. Well,... Goodbye, Juanjo. You're going away? No, to see what's here. It's nice here. "Go, walk. You didn't come until you've lost everything. " Again Don Antonio. Machado. - You know where the hotel is? - There, on that door. Thank you. Hello. - This is the Sol y Mar? - Yes. - I'm the one who called for the night. - Mr Antonio? The same. You can't enter with the girl. - Oh, no, no. I've come alone. - The girl can't enter. - Unless you make a family booking. - It's that she will... A cool, - while I drink coffee. - Okay. - You know if I can get coffee there? - That's all there is. What do I owe you, I've missed? I lost? A quarter. See you later. Why, again. What a drag. You will not will open, no. You will not will open. Hey. Looking for an employee? No, I have the poster for decoration. - Interested? - Not me. But maybe... Back in a sec. Hello. What is your name? Bruno. Have you seen a young kid here? You're counting the waves? Yes. Bye. If you want, I can take you to the station. Maybe find a train. Before it gets too late. Yes, I'd better get going. How far along are you? You don't have to hide it from me. Three months and something. Promise me you won't do any nonsense, eh? You're sure you have somewhere to go? You're sure? You're not lying, eh? Woman, don't cry, don't fuss. I'm not going to tell anyone. If you're old enough to get into this mess, surely... You're also old enough to know how... Which do not? See, good. Let's do something. Stay in the room, sleep here tonight. I'll see if this man has a spare room. No, no. Yes, woman, I'll pay. Okay? And tomorrow morning, rested, you can figure out how to get to Malaga. - I can't accept, pretty mess you've given. - I'll talk to the hotel. Let's see if I understand you, because I don't know what language you speak. Step. Only one left. - Who has the king? - Step. What about the phenomenon? There he goes, for now he hasn't broken anything. - Catalan, give us another wine. - I'm going. Catalan? De Torello. To stress, these people. Hotel man to understand oppositions to do. Which are you? Corridor tissue? No. Maybe I can help. Ando... I'm behind the shooting. Of the English? Yes. Do you know where I would go tomorrow to... to get close. I can find someone who can tell us. There's people around here helping out. That would be fantastic. Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening. Catalan, get us some booze. Tell the kid, I have an assistant now. This hair? Where did you get it. From Madrid. What do you think? A lady. Don't touch the balls. Take this. A penny each to be taken. The second house invite, no? The house invites only when Barca wins. We’ll have to wait granted. If it were not for the cheeky Ortiz de Mendíbil... You will not be of Madrid. No. Sport is for children. And then begins to be a business and... It will not lengthen uncle and ten minutes left... Hey, - this would not be better to take queue? - Leave him alone. If it looks like a girl and I don't answer. - Leave the kid alone! - A See if pulling the strands... Well, okay already, no? This is protected from this man. - And who is this? - He comes from the movie. Hey, you don't know the son of the Damiana, the water truck driver? Here goes, yes. - And where does he stop tomorrow? - What do I -A accounts. Then I say, that night will come where the mother. No, no. If Muscat is a tonic. And a place to eat around here? Hell, a place for dinner. Here. Darling! Get me another round. Bring some scissors and those that I told you. What heavy. I don't know you well. Now, do these poses one big hand on face and you'll be going to Granada to find your teeth. Several of the crew have been sleeping it off in Zapillo. The English are serious drinkers. The Italians of the western have disappeared. - What is this? - Pa amb tomaquet (bread with tomato). Probably the greatest contribution of Cataluña to universal history. It's fucking great. Try it, try it. This box gets stuck, damn it. Hey, and what does he have? - The singer? - Yes. As he moved Green Dolphin to a larger home in Almería. And he looks at the Rolls. He goes everywhere in a Rolls Royce with tinted windows. And has paging. Sometimes greets the speaker. Except a few days to be spoiled and walked taxi man. This country must seem absolute backwardness. Imagine. The world will have seen him in 25 years. Filling stadiums. Juanjo! Hey. Try this bread. Gloria blessed. My mother makes it too. It's Catalan. Now I'll show you where you sleep. - He sleeps here? - Yes. That room there. How has a Catalan made it here? It's a rather long story. He's my son. Who is? Who cares. Naming doesn't fix him. - Well, yes. - Milk-and will, Bruno. I was in the Aragon front in Teruel. In a town called Lechago I helped out an Italian deserter he wanted be smuggled out. - From the Mussolini Volunteers? - Yes. After the first shot they lost their desire for adventure. Good guy, Domenico. Good guy. And after the war, when I lost my place in the post office, because you keep writing and one day I went to Rimini to find out, and Domenico had a sister and his sister what she liked most was the sun. And if there's one thing Almeria has, it's sun. And Bruno was born here. He was born like that? Yes, quite normal. But look at six months which is not incorporated, that's not crawling. And the Italian? Maria Concetta. Coming and going from Italy. I guess she got tired of the sun and me. Pull forward to Bruno's hard. It also helped that hooked up with a photographer which came to a spaghetti western. But returns to spend time. And you know the worst? That I hope. I had this before and I missed to mourn. Now I think something happened to the other. Thus, no? The farther you have left, unless you don’t mind. The distance is wisdom. Spend a lot with the kids. The tremendous things are made. And over the years I realized they were nonsense. But at the time... Hey, it's the second that you drink. See if you're going to be expensive. It is indeed a rags, as the former employee left it. There are some clothes, maybe they'll fit you. If you want to take a shower, have tank hose. But don't use a lot of water. Since not a drop falls in March. I miss the close out, You can go out the other door. What are you doing? - We're going now. - Yes. This you can remove, if you don't like it. Can we use the phone? It would be nice to call his parents. Behind the bar. But don't take too long, it's conference. Oh, and I need your ID card. For the data. Yes, of course. Here. Juan José. Hey, good night. - Good Night. - Goodbye. Come, Bruno. Let's sleep. Good evening. Good evening. - What? Already collected? - Yes. Yeah. We've already collected. Tomorrow is another day. - You've all got a strong accent here, no? - No, we don't. They have strong accent in Cadiz, Granada and... There they have a strong accent. But not here. Everybody to bed. Good evening. Good evening. Have you heard? Everybody to bed. that's a solecism. I haven't understood anything. You want to come with me tomorrow? - You'll like seeing the set. - I don't know. Meet John Lennon... - You can brag to your friends. - Okay. We'll be getting up early, though. Good evening. Good evening. - Antonio. - Yes. Thanks for everything. Thank you for the company. Yes, I will. But when you are passing the anger dad. Not the hair, Mom. It's just everything. It's always the same, I'm sick of it. He's been good to talk to Modesto. At least it's come in the fumes. You said he also has to learn to give. Where are you staying? Oh, son, tell me something but a lie. To reassure me. - You're eating well? - Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry, really. I've been to frame glassware I painted the portrait. If it was fatal. You're not going to hang it at home. I like. There, there. Good Morning. You don't like mornings? Not really. My mother taught me to get up early. "Someone has to turn on the sun" she told me. There you have it, it's on for you. We are from Albacete, La Mancha, and we've come just to see him. It will be just a minute more. Anyway, you wait there in the car, I will consult with the English. Go back down there. What heavy. Neither let's approach. A see. They say without permission from production it won't happen. And where is production? There must be an office or something, right? That you have to go to Almeria. Let me through, please. That just will not do anyone any favours. I shit on you... holy hell. And we can't get to the set another way? We can't go cross-country... But they beat us a shot. And they are there? So I've been told. But maybe he is on his day. I don't know. I don't know. What's he gonna do? They're there. But if it's an amazing camp. There are even tanks. That's... It's the Rolls they told us about. John! John! What? Mister Lennon! John! Get off there, man, you're being ridiculous. Get off of there. Lennon! I look, like you are not going to have street to speak out and take the tuition, eh? Low-and me, man. I'm leaving. Go away, man. I don't see it as... - So complicated... - No. I said go away. Let him go. - How heavy. - Come on, man. It is giving a sack... Sorry, I hadn't noticed. - Are you all right? - Yes. Want a ride to the station now. What are you going to do? Let me help you. Somewhere... they sleep or they go to dinner when they're done, right? Yeah, but what can I say that bastard Don Paco? I dunno. That you crashed the car. Salt, salt, salt. Sal, you will not explode. You've removed the contact? Eh? It's the head gasket. I shit on you... holy hell. Why does everything always have to go wrong? Bollocks. Surely the City Guards can call you a towtruck. It's a beautiful thing. You know a lot about cars. Do you have a handkerchief? This sun is dangerous. Unless you know off. Go, go. Go. Don't worry about the car. The mechanic is very reliable. He may be a hippie, but he knows about cars. He fixed my van that was always giving me problems. - Hey. - And beach sand? To keep the soil moist. You can say my name? What? Here. It's sweet. The cutter is fed from heat, that's why it is so sweet. Hey, so you think that trucker will help me sneak onto the set? Let's see, the guy is delivering the water tank to them. But if you don't know every day nor do I know if you get into a commitment. He knows me wrong, but I leave without him... There, there. And trust, girl, what's yours? Nothing, you poor thing. As the other. In this country young people are desperate. They have no hope for the future. You're going to make a rally now. What do you want? Tell me a secret? Come on. We'll go outside. Careful, don't stumble. - You like strawberries? - I love them. Well come on. All of you, I'm fucking drowning in strawberries. What, you became friends? What she likes most is music. Ah yes, Bruno? This is an oven. Coming, Bruno. I'm coming. Watch it. Watch your hands. Get the strawberries. Then I close. Come, Bruno. We go to the box. - Good afternoon, José. - Good afternoon. Good. We've arrived. - Not going to know it. - There's this bar. Dena Cagu'n. Those bastards... I'm fine, I've messed everything up. Leave, leave, leave. In the cabinet there hydrogen peroxide and cotton. Come on. And you were here and you didn't do anything? They are things of kids. Things kids? Go away. Largo. Are you hurt? Apart from your pride? Go on. Get out. Here you go. Here you go. I shit on you... holy hell. We will have to denounce City Guards don't know. Leave, leave. These villages are very small. - Antonio. - Yes. You've seen Lennon? Julian. You're... Julian? Where is your father? Cynthia? Cynthia! But hey! You're not going to believe it, but I studied half a year to be a hairdresser. - And you didn't like it? Yes, but I had to leave. It was in Malaga. You have beautiful hair. What quality. Yes, like much here. Hey! I don't know what I've done to you, but I hope won't be alarmed when you see it. Easy, was tired of it taking over. These drawings have you done? Presto! It hasn't been too bad, right? Have hand, yes ma'am. And you too. Come on. The beams memory? A neighbour taught me. Sometimes I help repair some virgin plaster. Losing a finger or you chop a nose. I have fresh information. Every afternoon the Cervantes theatre holds a meeting of the eight so they can watch the shots from the day. With the director and crewmembers. - And they let you in? - That and... I can write John a note, explaining. How are you? Damn, you've managed your hair well. - If you want, you have a hairdresser. - You? - And this works. - It was veneer drawer, no... And if we go to the previous session? You'll just have to hide until the room clears. So much work for a guy. Needless to Claudia Cardinale out. That's a woman. This afternoon we go to the movies. Look. We're pirates. They can take me to the farm? I'm going to see a sister of mine which is in a state of good hope. Get on, there's room for everyone. It's not stuck. Go to the other door. Oh, a priest. - Are you scared? - No, by God. I have a brother in the seminary. My leg's asleep. Come here please. Let's start. Start. Look, he got a haircut and has glasses. At last. It's myopic but hid. And he didn't come? No. It seems not. Come on, come on. We have to be very careful. This way. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. See if he succeeds. It's a toupee, I know the master hairdresser. Manolo Escobar? - And John Wayne, toupee. - Seriously? And Frank Sinatra. Hey, hey. Why are you here? Still no session. The Manolo Escobar film, it's not screening? - From ten. - We wait until ten? You're not waiting here. On the street. That Manolo Escobar film isn't screening until ten. - What? - And where has this gone? This man says we have to wait outside. Yes, yes. Out, out. You can return then. - He just loves Manolo Escobar. - Who? Me? How did it go? As they say in the movies: I need a drink. Go, go, go. A street to street. The key is to catch the song in Radio Luxembourg and record. But before the record comes out in Spain. So the kids boast of knowing the lyrics and translate to the elderly. Eh! It works. - It's an evidence of edu... educ... - Ed-u-ca-tion. - I'm right. - Yes, yes, yes. Always right. Saco letters ear but no way, things escape. And leave ugly holes in notebooks, but of course, as have the mania don't include the lyrics on the albums... Why? I don't know. That's what I want. Talking to John, no? Teach notebooks and tell him, face to face, "Hey. Look, John, "There are guys in Albacete... - "Yes, John, in Albacete... " - And why in Albacete? - He teaches in Albacete. - Albacete city. - You have a license? - No. - But you know how to drive? - Let's hope. You see? This is what I mean. People learn when they want to, when they find a motivation. You know? That comes out of themselves, not a teacher and the curriculum... I know that my students some day will say to their kids: "I had a teacher who taught me English with I Wanna Hold Your Hand. " Which means "Let me hold your hand. " Because there are songs that saved your life. You know? Knowing that someone felt before what you're feeling at that moment. Eh? You're not alone. We all need to scream Help! some time in our lives. Help! - Like John. Help! Come on. Help! - Help! - I'm still right? - Yes, yes, yes. Always right. Then we will list irregular verbs and... I don't care who's ridiculing me. You know what they call me? - What? - What is it? Good... Let's sleep. Tomorrow will be a historic day. - Until tomorrow, Juanjo. - Good evening, Antonio. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. He is sleeping. There are Beatles songs that will be forever. Because they touch people, because they are joyful and melancholy. You know why? Because life is joyful and melancholy. You know John was also an unwanted child. Conceived on a Saturday night with a few drinks. Thrown into solitude, ...but also into life, Belén. You are beautiful. You don't have to suffer. You shouldn't suffer. Everything will be happy and sad, you'll see. - Can I have a kiss? - Sure. I'm going to sleep. I just want you to think about one thing tonight. Okay? Will you marry me? I'll think about it. I'd marry you. - I went weeks without one. - Why? I lived with people and wasn't allowed. You want one? No. I don't know, they make me dizzy. - My father smokes cigars and suck. - I'm going to put on music. love does not... boast, is not puffed up, does not seek its own interests but rejoices in truth. - She's gorgeous. - She's a favourite of Ram?n. Look at those features. - I'm not her. - But you're also very pretty. You think? Yes. - I'm sure you don't know a lot of girls. - I know enough. - "Enough. " - I don't know. I have eyes. And you like to look at girls? I like looking at you. But I'm not like the girls in these films, eh? Come. Come. Now is when I tell you I'm pregnant. You're kidding. No? Yes. Three and half months of kidding. Sorry. There's nothing to apologize for. I already said I'm not what you think. Come. Sit here with me. You're scared? No. Yes I'm scared. My mother sent me to a place where they look after you until the child comes and then, if I want, they can take care of the baby. And I can go back to the neighbourhood neighbouring importune without my mother. And marry the son of Don Ricardo, the pharmacist. That's what she wants. Yeah. They call him the pellets. Because he spits a lot when he talks. He once told me he wanted me to distraction: "I love you madly. " And covered my face in drool. And the father? The father might as well be John Lennon. I... I don't want anyone to decide for me. No one can force you to do anything. I love you. You continue with your movies. - And you haven't thought about going to Madrid? - And what have I missed in Madrid? I dunno. It is a big city. - Nobody knows you there. - I don't know anyone either. Now you know me. I know you? For real? And who are you? Want me to tell you what will happen? Surely it has already happened to you with some other girl. You want her, love her, you say you love her, you'll always be at your side... And suddenly... You don't feel anything. Don't say that. "Best, was when you said "I also wanted you. now all happened. "Best was when you thought, "you want me, now it happened. " You've grown, think are not always so. "Best "It will "forget your love. "It will "Best "maybe for both. "Maybe for both. " Eh! Come on, you have to go now! I didn't go to breakfast. I cannot get nothing. One, two, testing, testing... Come, come, eh? What to get in plenty of time. But I don't know if I can go. Good morning. Very good. I already had the car repaired. Ah, thank you very much. Hey, I'm taking the kid, eh? This could be an unforgettable experience for him. Go helper I've searched. He spends more time with you than working. And this? A gift. This guy is a gem. Have you seen? And what's the idea? Rot in this town where there are only lizards and stones? And Belén? She's gone. She hasn't even slept at the hotel tonight. Look, I'm telling you from experience: to understand women, it's best to forgo understanding. Go you know what they want. Then you have me, with a heart that It fits in my shirt and just one. Look. She's there. It's her. Bel?n. Stranger, a charity. Buy me some pears. And who are you? - Miguel. - Miguel? You aren't going to school? - What school? - The one the children go to. You know? Where the teachers teach them to read and write. I help mother. See what I have here. Look. Good! Here. Wait. Wait, I have the best thing for you. Look. - There you go. Do you like it? Eh? - And for lunch? Here. Thank you. Bye. Good morning. You remember me last night at the movies? Yes. I'm... I'm looking for Mike. Hi! - Antonio! Glad to see you. - Hello Michael. How are you? John has read your note. And... Very windy and we have to a break. So you can see him now. Great, yes! Yes. Come on. Sorry, guys. No. I'm so sorry. John is very shy. But if they are my friends. I know. But John is shy. Sure, yes. No would be fine. Okay, yes. Guys, it says that only I can accompany me, who is very shy. No, no, of course. You go. Yes? Well, here I come. Wait, wait. You're very handsome. Look. That's him. Yes. It's going to... Yes. She's a hairdresser. She could help you. It's okay. Come. Come on. You do it very well. What? Military style. You know. Short. - Military? - Yes. Scissors. And a comb. Thank you. Don't take off a lot, right? I have a wedding on Saturday. You see? Whether you work in film. Let's dance. A twist. Come on. I know It's not dance. It's super easy. It is as a separate and upward feet. Come, give me your hands. Give me your hands. Turn around. I don't know if it was the tea. He takes his tea very strong. Or the marijuana. I had some marijuana cookies that he offered me and I wasn't going to say no. I almost fell. Don't want a swim? It's lovely. Bond. James Bond. The strange thing is... Someone who is so famous, you know? There talking to me, as if we knew each other for a lifetime. And filling notebooks with the lyrics. With colored markers. Yellow Submarine has corrected yellow. And what did you talk about? He promised that he'd come to a class. One day. I've said that kids are they are very modest and... And he answered me: Best". We've spoken. From when he was a student. Almost all the teachers were horrible. Well, we have something in common. Having bad teachers isn't so serious. Sometimes, if you have talent, a bad teacher helps you decide for yourself. To not accept everything without question. Our profession is so absurd. Hey, hand me the wine. Let's not get hot. And what else did he tell you? We talked about his mother. I'm not sure why we talked so much about his mother. And Liverpool. We almost didn't talk about the Beatles. He didn't even know whether to continue with the band. Really? They're breaking up? - He's tired of touring. - And he wants to be an actor? Yeah, an actor. Well, I mean to make films. Marlene's legs. He also told me that he was impressed Marlene Dietrich's legs, one night he met her at a party. She there, leaning against a piano, with magnificent legs. It has been sunburned, whitey is so... And he sang me a song. The half he has. - That he sang? - Yes, with the guitar. This is it. I recorded it here. "Let's see if your kids like it," he said. And here... Here he wrote the lyrics for me. Untitled so far. So, you've become friends. But of course man I haven't told you will come to see me? You see the guy's face when this one day in class. Don't touch it with your fat fingers full of grease! "Living is easy with eyes closed. " Come, Antonio. Ready? This is very... That's what you recorded? Eh? Is it? What will you do? Leave it, not ever. I'm going to say one thing to him. It's very important. You can't live in fear. Eh? In this country there are many people living in fear. But you are young and you have to change this, dammit. You have to shake the fear. Life is like a dog: if it smells fear, it will bite you. I think you should to apologize to the boy, okay? He didn't like the haircut? He didn't like it and I didn't like it. Look, I know it's hard to apologize to a stranger, and a young lad, but I think you should. Will you leave me alone? Never, never let someone take your dignity. Today, this bastard has learned a lesson. Give me a penny and I clean the car. Come on, come on. Well, first sweep it clear, come on. I pay. - Why? - Because it needs cleaning first. Come on. Let's go for the cubes! Bruno, watch them, eh? Be left gleaming. You take me to the station if you go along? Sure.

That's what they call me "The Fifth Beatle. " You know where I am, eh? - If you need help... - Thank you. Don't leave without taking some strawberries. Hey, sir. That's it... That's the car washed. Wait. - What's in your eyes? - It's trachoma. I was going to miss here. You bastard! I shit on your whole generation! Help! Help! You've cut your hair. For your class. Hope you like it. What is that? A song. And this is the music you like?
