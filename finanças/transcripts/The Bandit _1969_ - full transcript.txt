THE BANDIT Loosely based on the homonymous novel by Giovanni Verga. - SICILY 1865 - The freeing war that resulted in the annexation of Sicily to Italy some years ago, along with Giuseppe Garibaldi's triumphant crossing of the island, had again ignited big passions across the nation. Gramigna. Gramigna! - What do you want? - The horses! Come in, come in. You better wait outside. Lord Nardo gets to enter first. You are neither a seller nor a buyer, who are you? I'm Lord Nardo's right-hand man. The Lord is on his way. Get everything set, it's urgent. - Gramigna? - Me? No, I'm Angelo Corleone, Domenico's son. Nardo and Gramigna had me as a mediator during their trade. Just like Gramigna, I needed the dough excuse me, the money ...only Lord Nardo could give it to him but... -But? Gramigna's son has decided to join Garibaldi's unit. Granted, Lord Nardo was not pleased with that... Do you know what I mean? A baron, by nature, is always on Bourbon's side. And I've been able to mediate, even if I'm not on Bourbon's side or on Garibaldi's side. My respects. Ah, many thanks. Cheers. Are you Gramigna? - I'm the mediator. - How come? Two mediators? In order to sell a country estate as tiny as this room? And take your hat off! Thank you, but I only take my hat off inside the church or before the Lord. My respects, My Lord. Mister notary, the Lord! My Lord, please consider yourself at home. - Blessed be, My Lord. - My respects. - Are we ready? Not you! Why not? Is the land on your name? Answer me! Then stay out, you are not the seller. You have no business here. Am I clear? You can come. You've shit your pants. I can smell it from here, trust me. Sit down. - So? - It's a deal for me. I'm selling the land that borders Nardo's land ...reaching its path and the mountain. - Understood. What about the south border? It borders my land. The land and the house possessed by Gramigna. How big is the plot of land? It's sold by registered land, why focus on the measurements? We only sell the parcel marked in red and shown in the map with the number 105. The parcel 105 on the map has 3000 m². That's why I buy 3000 m², using measurements. Santa Rosalía! Without using measurements, I think it's the same plot of land. Then I'll sell it by measured size. Let's just conform with what we're given. I want to help, and he insults me. I only came out of pity. They've had it up to here with problems, as heard in the court of Naples. I'm buying some land, but having it or not doesn't change a thing for me, as I already have it all. I've also decided to break with the past, as we're now all Italian. - Indeed. - From Bourbonic and Piamontese origins ...rich and poor. - Excuse me. The starving man becomes unfair? Be glad, you closed a good deal. I can read the contract first if you'd like. We're all trustworthy people here. Let's go before the candle burns out. The money is on the notary's desk. This way we'll pay our debt in order to build our house. I wouldn't give anything, to anyone. This money has been lent by people like us. It was out of sheer trust, and we returned it all down to the last penny. I won't give away my share to anyone. I'm your father as long as I'm alive and in my house we follow my rules. I have a bad feeling. You had to sell it to him, of all people? And who else in this town can buy this property? They're all like us, a bunch of deadbeats. He bought it for the sake of revenge. Revenge? And what have we done to him? The Lord will never forgive you for kissing Garibaldi's hand in front of everyone while I was battling with the red shirt in Messina. I swear I'll rip the Lord's heart out and everyone else that made me sign the contract if I've been misled. - Son, the Carabinieri are here. - What? - Open the door. - What do you want? We have no problems with the law. If you're on the law's side, leave immediately the house that you have sold to the noble Eugenio Nardo di Ventosa before Gugurra the notary. Will you resist? Keep trying. Give me the money. Open it, the Carabinieri are here! - Tell me what you want from us. - We want nothing to do with you, you just have to leave the house the once belonged to you. There is a misunderstanding, the house is ours. Only the land was sold. Notarial act signed by Gennaro Gugurra. It comes down to this, The owner of the land also owns the house within, which has already been rented by Don Eugenio. Understood? Go ahead, bring everything in. That's how you thank us? You also mistreat us. We long for justice like we wait for a miracle ...and in turn... - You claim we're abusing you - We're not mistreating anyone, we enforce the law. - Where are you going, son? Heading to town. I didn't sell the house, and now I'm supposed to give it away? We built it ourselves and we haven't even finished it yet, and it cost us all the money we've got. I know, I know, but please try to be understanding. So the law is failing us, because it's been carried out with cruelty. We are representing the authorities in charge and you've already been informed by the officer. We've been instructed to go ahead, what else can we do? I have no clue. I've been told to come here, and that's what I've done. That's it. And you came with the Carabinieri. - What are you looking at? - Why? Am I not allowed to look around? You keep looking... because I'll be the one telling you what you're allowed to watch once we marry. I can look at whoever I want. You are mine, and you shall obey me. I am my own master until you can lay in my bed. Is that clear? What did my father sell yesterday? - I have no idea who your father is. - Gramigna. I need an explanation. - What did my father sell? - A piece of land. 3000 m²... So the house is ours! Including all goods, furniture and properties, the house being part of it. The house was never included in our deal. - I cannot do whatever I want. The contract has already been signed. You must file a report if you've been bluffed. Too many papers. Too many papers. Too many papers! Too many deceptions! You'll be sent to the mainland for false appropriation. Don't move. You take everything away from us with papers. Everything is stolen from us! Jesus! This is your king! Help! The king is replaced, the government is replaced, the soldiers, everything! But the false papers are always there. Everything changes, but for us. Nothing changes for us and for you, mister notary. Nothing! - Everything will be burned to ashes. - Help! Jesus! I went as far as Messina with Garibaldi! - You're going mad! - But only the officers got away. - Help! - The notaries stayed! The notaries haven't gone back to mainland! Bring water! Fire! Fire, fire! Throw it all on the fire! Back off, back off! Let it all burn! Let it all burn! Every burned up document means one miscarriage of justice less. It's a day to be celebrated! Indifference? Joy, joy! Have a laugh too! Burn whatever you feel like, it's on Gramigna today. What is a notary? A servant of the Lord. And who is Corleone? A servant of a Lord. And Lumia, also a servant. And Buretto, all of them. All servants! Let's burn all these servants! Servants, barons, all happy and joyful, while we're breaking our backs? Are you scared? Come in, civilians, come in. No, not the Lord. We must stop him. Let's go. Enough! Gramigna, kill them all! Gramigna will thank you for this. What's going on? Are you nuts? Is this some kind of joke? Some people took my house away from me and you're among them. So I've decided to pay a visit to some rich civilian, and take something away, whatever I need... Matches... and bread. Bread, because I'm hungry. And I also want money. An some winter clothes. I want that jacket over there. You too, go away! Gramigna will thank you later... and leave. What do you want to do, son? Get revenge. This is not fair, for heaven's sake.. You were not allowed in the notary. It's all my fault. - You're not guilty of anything. - I decided to trust them and we lost the house. It's all my own doing. Nothing can be saved, not even the house. You're a god father. I've never been able to give you anything in my life. and now that you have to run like a dog you're going to get revenge for my wrongdoings, as I let the house be taken from me. - You have to kill me. - Don't be silly! you have to leave in peace. You're old, and you need to get some rest. It's important that you don't get tangled up in this. You're completed your duties. No one is going to touch you while I am alive. My dear son, listen to your father. If you shoot me, they will be blamed for it and you'll get your revenge. - Who's that? - A friend. - Are you Orlando? - Yes. - Where's your father? - Over there. Alone? - No - And who's there? Mum, and the boys. Everyone, we're eating. Not in front of the kids. Relax, son. Relax. Move away. I'm sorry, but I've also been misled. I respected your father, remember that. You're trading me in exchange for one of your enemies's life, and I'm letting you live. Lord Nardo. Eugenio Nardo's head is mine! But first I want him to be scared for his life, and then with my hands, with my teeth, I'm going to destroy him. Let Francesco Spada to me, then. He was the one proposing me this whole affair, but he didn't tell me it was a trap. Francesco Spada sounds good to me, but before Racalmuto's party. Would you like to rest? Do you want to sleep in my house? Don't you know that Gramigna sleeps unsheltered? But what's going on? Mother of Jesus! Baffo, Cortello, run! Gramigna! Go find him! Baffo. Don't disappear now, Baffo! What a disaster! But how did he get in? Close off the premises! Get some help. Try to find Baffo. Gramigna! He's there, get him! The livestock, the water, I've poisoned everything! Gramigna did it! Gramigna, it's poison! May he be damned! Get him! Bend down! - Would you like to live or die? - What do you mean? - Someone of your kind is granting life? - I don't really give any grants... I sell. And what is the price I should pay? I want Angelo Corleone's life. But careful, before Racalmuto's life. Are you hungry? Do you want so bread, wine? Gramigna doesn't drink your wine... and doesn't eat your bread. The Lord is calling you, fast. - May I kiss your hands, My Lord. - Ah, Ramarro... You haven't told me anything about the new house. My finance's family is living there for now, and I'll move in too once we're married, as expected. - Are you already set on it? - Yes, My Lord - Very good. I'll have a nice gift ready for you. Get the carriage ready! Speaking of the wife... The old Gramigna, the father, had pestered the women living in the house. What about yours? Do you know anything about it? Eh? I've heard very bad things. Should I be concerned? You might have to live together as dictated by the law, while he tries to get the house back. You can never predict the verdict. And if he finds supports and a judge rules in his favor, you are screwed. This should be kept in mind. If he's found dead, for instance, I'm sure the son would be blamed for it. If he wants to live with us, he'll find his home in the cemetery. If you want to carry this out, the sooner, the better. The Carabinieri know the son is penniless. The father leaves, and the son kills him... But soon. Stop! Come on, lazy peasants, go help the Piamontese. Go! Carmela! Where is Carmela? The Piamonese cannot wait. Carmela is there. The sauce. Let me remind you that the sauce must be strong. Since that night we let it simmer for a long time. You won't add more firewood? Bring some here, it's still cold. My Lord, they're about 70. Damn it! A lot of cavalry coming from Piamontese. Gramigna will be held hostage tonight. - Give me that. - How much meat should I prepare for the soldiers? we're going to give them beans. They're young, and quantity is more important than quality for them. - Is this a good horse? - What do you mean? I'm lost. Where are you going with this horse? Leave it there! Gramigna is not a bandit, he's worse than an untamed beast. He has created some true havoc. He knows what these illiterate people will take for freedom and independence. Only turmoil, revolution, looting, massacre. And Gramigna was one of them, a bloody lunatic. It looks like he killed his father, and there's nothing else to be said when one kills their own father. - He's a monster. - Has there been more deaths in town? Thank God, no one for now but who knows what will happen tomorrow. Gramigna can become a symbol for the desperate souls. They say "Italia", "Garibaldi"... but they only think of revolution. 100 lira per horse, that's what I was paid last time. The price has gone up, but I don't want a single penny more from the Piamontese. Even I I end up on the losing end, because horses like this... can't be found in all of Sicily, eh? A lot of them died. But it doesn't matter, freed me from Gramigna and you can get all the horse you'd like. We are sure we'll be able to find him by tomorrow. Look, my 70 men come from a very special unit. It's almost like an expedition unit that the government is assembling with the purpose of freeing Sicily from banditry. And it will be easy with 70 men, like a walk in the park. Eh, ladies! Has Giuseppe Gramigna been seen around here? We saw him when we arrived, so days ago, but he wasn't a bandit yet. - This was his house. - I see. - He's in the mountains now. Do you work for the Lord? We follow orders from our Majesty Victor Manuel, king of Italy. We've come to free Sicily from the bandits. - Good mission. Thank the King. - Goodbye. This will teach you not to open your mouth again! You shall keep your mouth shut! - What do I have a mouth for, then? - In order to say "yes", always! Do you get it? Yes, always! I won't ever say "yes" Not to Ramarro, not to you, not to anyone! Good morning everyone. I salute you with God's help. Good morning. An enemy of yours has sent me to have a word with you. - Who sent you? - Gramigna. He'd asked me to let you know that he's going to kill one of the Orlando brothers. - Only one of them. - What a moderate soul! - Out of them who is Antonio Orlando? - It's me. You're the one he wants to kill, he has no business with your other brothers. Go tell him we're waiting for him, and we're not afraid. I can't inform him, as I'm going my own way. ...and he's taking his. - Where did you find him? He was still far when I came across him, but he may be nearby now. He also confided in me to tell you this. Let's take the guns! Inside, come on! Everyone inside! Come on! Back in the house! Ricuccia! - Are the kids with you? - Grandma, they are inside the house. Turi! Turi! Where is he? - Antonio, not you. - Not you! - Let this to me, it's my business! Silence! Drop the gun. Cross yourself. - You won't cross yourself? - Don't kill me. I can join your unit, or give you lots of money. I can give you anything you want. Including one of my women. You get to choose. Take everything. Take everything you'd like. everything. I'll take it all... because life is what I'm taking. You'll also be killed, you'll see. Like they killed your father! Do you understand? Is that true? Is that true? Who was it? Who was it?! My father build this house. He was old. He worked so hard... and I've been told he's been killed. Careful! - Sir, has he walked past? - Well, let's ask. No one has got inside the house? No men and no bandits are allowed to get in. This is Gramigna's house, and he was the bandit inside these walls, but they belong to me now. I beg you pardon. My soldier is just rambling, he's a bit ignorant. He's not experienced with local manners, you know? We have no bandits in Piemonte. Give me a break! All Italy is equal to the bandits. Anyway, we're sorry. Welcome to my house. Greetings and blessed be your family. Gemma is over there, but she's coming back in a minute. Why can't she come, is she sick? Gemma comes from a strong family. She's cleaning her room, she enjoys tidiness. I'm going to call her. Gemma, Gemma. Ramarro has arrived with his mother and his two aunts. - I feel ashamed. - Why are you ashamed? They're women like you. They'll be offended if you don't come soon. Let go of me! You have to look proper. - Is he also there? - Of course, but he's not in. Whenever you wish, Gemma is ready. You're too shy to show your hair? Take your scarf off. Look at her white and soft skin. We can only see her face. Why doesn't she show a bit more? We need to see you, Gemma. If you're as pretty as you seem to be, there's no reason to feel ashamed. - We'll vouch for you. - Don't worry, he trusts us. If we tell him you didn't undress before us won't he think you're hiding something? Let's see. Look at this. Her beautiful and straight legs. And you haven't seen her other attributes. You ought to see her breasts. Breasts made for pleasure and feeding. But are they firm enough to please men? Yes, touch them, you're entitled to it. Enough! He's a lucky man. - She's beautiful and healthy. - Good job, Gemma. You have a beautiful woman on your hands. Go get the wedding dress. It's all sewn by hand. Measure it, I think the measurements are fine. We'll adjust it if it's too loose or too tight. It must be perfect. - Turn around. - Yes, just like that. I think it's fine. My God, it's Gramigna! Get out! And let the soldiers from Piamontese know how Gramigna got his revenge, by burning his father's house down! Gemma, what are you doing? Help! Help! Ramarro, what's wrong? Are you injured? Gemma! Gemma! Where are you? Gemma! - Where is she? - We need water! - Gemma! - Gemma! Gemma! Where is Gemma? It's Gramigna! Gemma! - Socorro, Socorro! Fire! - Gemma! - Gemma! Gemma! Don't worry, we'll find her later. Don't worry. Let's go over there. Gramigna, come out. I'm here with the Piamontese. They are 200 soldiers in total. You'll be spared if you come out and let Gemma free. Go away! Get off! Go back down. Fill it with water. Gemma! Get away, you whore! Gramigna! Gramigna, they're going to save your life if you come out. Gemma! Gramigna! Fire! Do you have fever? - Greetings, Corleone. - Greetings. We'll be ruined if it doesn't start raining soon. Only Gramigna can take both of us down. Gramigna? He's in a peaceful mood. He's thinking about some woman, rather than on us. Ramarro and the Piamontese are the ones we should be aware of. Do you get it? Yes, I do. Had we not followed the Lord's orders, we might have been better off. The Lord or Gramigna, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, we still need to follow orders. Is that clear? Obeying Gramigna can be painful, but perhaps necessary. You found the right word for it: necessary. Gramigna makes you do what you don't feel like doing. He knows how to force you into it. - You do too. - For sure. And for the reason that you know well. - Be clearer. - Hasn't he given you orders to kill me? Why has Gramigna spared your life? I'm sure it's in exchange for someone else's. But he did the same thing to me! Troops, get set! There's someone down there escaping on a horse. That must be Gramigna! Alert! We've been given orders to seize the right side of the mountain. Goddamn it, is that Gramigna? Pay more attention next time. Let's hope this doesn't put us into trouble. Go back to your positions. Quiet! Gemma. - Gemma. Gemma, what have they done to you? - No, I was the one who shot. - That's nuts, you could've killed me! - What about me... ...couldn't you have killed me? You didn't shoot me. But I'm daydreaming now, we have women's dresses, bread, cheese, everything. Let's go! One second, you have to take your clothes off. Now. Have you heard that? Let us see you undressed. Undressed? What is that supposed to mean? I'm going to die anyway, dressed or not. Just kill me already! We don't kill just for the sake of it. We need reasons for it, and you haven't given us any. You should feel ashamed like I was, totally naked before your grannies! Let me see you naked! Undress yourself! Undress yourself. Let me see it. Keep going, keep going. Take off your shirt now. Ramarruzzo, take your underwear off. Ramarruzzo, show your ass. Show it all. Your ass, your ass! Quick! - Quick!, Ramarruzzo! - Quick, quick! I'm all set. - The portrait will be delivered in 3 days. - Alright. And you, you dummy, pay attention. Are you ready. Move over. You're gorgeous. Grandpa, ...the portrait should be taken here. - Get closer together. We're ready. Silence. Done. Let it to me! Thank you. What are you doing, are you sleeping? Are you asleep? And you, are you sleeping? Or just pretending to? Don't be scared, I won't hurt you. Are you afraid of the bandits? - Let me tell you, there are no bandits! - There's only problems for us. The land you're farming is burning your hands! Look how sleepy this one is! Gramigna, we're not against you but we're not with you either. The land you're farm is the bandit killing you! And who do these belong to? They belong to Nardo. They belong to Nardo! They belong to Nardo! They belong to that thief, that respected bandit! Blow out instead of sighing! And shred those patched up shirts to make a flag out of it. You're small-minded! Blow out instead of sighing! If we all blow in the wind, it will take all the lords away from this world! You're setting yourself against everyone. They're all quiet. No one is moving. - Too bad, too bad for them! - You'll be killed, one day or another. Gemma! You don't think of me. We must live alone. Let's not drop poison between ourselves. And so they got married. Gemma, and Giuseppe Gramigna. To enlightenment! To enlightenment! Men, women and children from all over Sicily! Come see the miracle on Mount Messina! The most gorgeous wife from the Black Virgin of Tidari! Come see Gramigna's lover and wife! Gramigna, gaze at the sea. Let's cross it. The mainland is on the other side. And who knows the people from the mainland? I believed they would bring us freedom, but they only brought us judgement, and no land for anyone. "And they lived happily ever after" Just like the old story ends, And we're left with nothing. We must stay here, as your roots belong to this land. Here's where I must stay. Here where I've been accused of killing my father. I do understand you, Gramigna is focused on his revenge only, - But he never thinks of Gemma. - I'm supposed to play dumb. In the fire, on the sea, the flowers. These are all giveaways. If there is a house, I believe this is the one. And if it isn't, farewell! If you're sick of walking, and running, and being always on the run, leave! Gramigna won't shed a tear! Where are you going? Where are you going?! Where are you going? You are Gramigna's spouse! You knew what he was about! A miserable, desperate man! Let off of me! Let off of me! I can't lose you. I don't want to lose you. Gemma, I love you. I love you very much, Gemma. I love you too. Inside the cave. The cave. Shoot with the shotgun. Just like Garibaldi's troops, they were proper shooters. Shoot at them, Ramarro, and they will die. No, I'm going to possess her first and kill both of them right after. Yes, yes, possess her. This way, Gramigna will be a cuckold and we'll laugh at his expense. Bravo! You shall help me, that's why I've brought you here. Alright, but what am I getting in exchange? A horse. A horse? - Tell me, what should I do? - You should approach him as a friend. Later, you're going to tell him that Lord Nardo's herd will come down the valley at night. All clear? He'll come out, you'll see. And then... you're going to give me the horse? Listen, everyone tries to scam me. I'll tell Garibaldi if you don't give me the horse. Gramigna. Gramigna. Are you deaf? Gramigna. Gramigna! It's me, Passione. How have you arrived? I also want to be a bandit. I also want a a shotgun and a horse. I'm going to shoot them all. You fool! Fool? What do you want? Gemma. - Gemma. Bella! - What have you seen? you are Gramigna's spouse. You already made... to Gramigna... with Gramigna, a bandit. Tell me how you managed to come here on your own. I... I came on my own. I guessed so, I swear. - It's also being said all over the town: - Passione... - "Gemma is a beautiful woman". - Passione, tell me the truth, who has sent you up here? - Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth! - No one has sent me here. - Who has sent you? - No one, no one. I swear. I swear! No one has sent me here. I came up here to get myself a horse. Don't move from here. I want to have you in sight at all times. You fool! Fool. - Make me laugh. - Excuse me? Make me laugh, you fool! Are you going to steal a horse for me! Gramigna will steal a horse for you. Passione! Where are you going? On a horse! Gramigna will give me a horse. He'll give me a horse. And why do you want a horse? I can't tell you. And what are you going to do with it? I'm not going to help Ramarro, I'll let him the horse, ...because he's the cuckold. - Where is Ramarro? - First he'll rape you, and then he wants to kill you. -Passione... - Passione, you've betrayed us. - No. I'll kill you. Don't kill me like you killed your father. - What are you saying about my father? - Nothing. Everyone says you killed him. But what are you talking about? -No, Gramigna. I didn't kill my father! - Don't kill me. - I didn't kill my father! - I didn't kill my father! - I didn't kill my father! - I didn't kill my father! Gemma. Gemma! Gemma! Gemma! Shut up, whore! No! No! Over there. He's there! Come! Quiet! What do you have to do in all this? That's is my business! Quiet! You go first. Go! Let go of me! Let go of my, that's my business! - Let go of me! - You stay here. Leave her to Ramarro! Gramigna's wife is everyone's woman. I'll get you all killed once the Lord is buried. When he finds out that Gramigna's wife has laid with everyone, ...he'll give us a penny each. Come on, let go of me. Let's finish this already! Quick, Gramigna may be coming back! Quiet! Shut up. - No! - Quiet or I'll kill you. Bella! Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Come on, Ramarro, it's your turn to have some fun now. Ramarro, it's your turn. - Come on, move! - Move, Ramarro! - Suddenly he can't speak. - What's the matter? - Should we help? - Are you shy? Come on, show your worth. Cheer up. - Make an effort. - Show us the man you are. You can do this, go for it. Cher up. Let's go. If Gramigna comes, he'll only see Ramarro. Gemma... Open, open. - Who's there? - It's me, mother. What's your reason for coming? I come to eat, to sleep. Have you come alone? Alone... Alone forever. Ramarro comes every night. - Relax, mother, we won't see him anymore. - Gemma, what do you mean? I killed him. Oh my god! He really loved you. You have to say it's Gramigna fault, and he did it out of jealousy. No, I did it. You have to blame him if you want to get away with it. He's a bandit, and he's killed so many people. One more or one less, it makes no difference. It's different for you. Life has still a lot to give to you. You may end up in jail until you're old. Listen to your mother, Gemma, you have to blame Gramigna. No. Never. Is that his whistle? Yes. Be careful, Gemma, he's desperate. What are his intentions? And what if he kills you? - Someone has to do it, sooner or latter - What are you talking about now? All my efforts since birthing you and it ends up like that? I'm so sorry, I've only caused you pain. But Gramigna is my man. And I don't care how this will all end. - He's calling my name, I've leaving. - Gemma. Gemma! I feel old. Ramarro... Have you also seen him? I killed him. Why? Why? Answer me. Why? - Answer me. - Gramigna, they've broken me. They caught me and there was nothing I could do. This is also my fault. I should've slashed Nardo's head from the get-go. Few men have been killed by me! Gramigna shouldn't have had a wife. I should've sought my revenge, and have it be the end of it. Now... ...I'm going to search them all. - Where are you going? - I'm coming for them all! - No! No! No. No! Stay here. Gramigna, no! Me first! Kill me! - Kill me! - Let off of me, Gemma! No! Don't leave me alone! No! Kill me! - Go away! - Gramigna! I beg you, I beg you! - Gramigna. - Leave, Gemma. - No, if you love me, don't leave me. - Let me go. - Don't let me alone, Gramigna! - Gemma. - I beg you! Gramigna! Gramigna! It's not harvest season yet. All my grapes are going to waste. You've helped a bandit up there, so have him eat all the grapes. Who do we have to do with Gramigna? I've been misinformed. We've never helped Gramigna, ever. And have you helped me, by any chance? The one feeding you all year round? Gramigna killed all my best stallions, and none of you moved a finger, isn't that right? So now I'm the one not moving a finger for you. Come on, let's go! My Lord, we shall not catch the bandit, let it to the Piamontese and their horses. Gramigna is our affair, am I clear? Gramigna means hunger for everyone. The grapes, the grains, it was all traded for this poor man's Sicily. I'm saying this as Sicilian to Sicilian. Go catch Gramigna, catch this bandit, Sicily's biggest shame. Kill him! And if you don't, it means you're just like him: honorless Sicilians. Come on! Civilians! These are Nardo's grapes. Let's harvest them. Let's destroy all the plants, the grapes shall not blossom here. Quiet, quiet. Go back. Silence! Have you gone mad? Where are you going? This is my land! Go back! Go back! Move out of my way! Stinky cowards! I'll kill you. I'll kill you! These are my vineyards! Get off! Get off! Go away! Get out of here! Out. I'll kill you. Out! Get out! Back off! Back off! Get away from my land or I'll kill you. Mark my words, Alfiero Nardo, I'll kill you all! Come in, who wants to start? - What's going on? - Nardo! - What's going on? Speak up! - They're killing the Lord! The Piamontese are coming! Gramigna didn't hill his father. Piamontese, this is what you have sown. This village, burned to ashes, is what you have sown! It's your time to reap! Fire! Sargent, urgent message from the second order, light cavalry unit, Dated today, 10th September. A special unit has killed Gramigna, the bandit, in a crossfire. We inform you that peace and order will be restored in our province. Troops, move forward. My love, what have you made me do made me do total madness! Our Lord and Savior has made me forget the best bit off Ave Maria. Love, love, love, love, love. Love, love, love, love, love, I loved you since I first saw you, as by a stroke of magic. You grew like the grass in the field, you grew, all beautiful, to love me. THE END
