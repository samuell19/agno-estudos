Dreams are for the imaginative. Life told from juicy lips, of drips that one could taste if you could muster a sip. Ain't life a trip? Loneliness is for the brave. I never choose to behave, though I'm not one for settlement or take kind to those who praise to be intimate. I'll say it loud, who I am, I'm not proud. All right, repeat after me, you control your own destiny of your own life. Do not limit yourself. Say it with me. Do not limit yourself. All right, very good, very good. Now, repeat after me, make things happen. Make things happen. Great, now you should be feeling empowered, now you should be feeling that image and the source that you have within you. Who are you to judge me, me of thee? But I am free. Free to be me, free to be you. If only I had a clue. Out of fear, I fight to be loved, to be held, to be cherished for what I am, as I am. Hey. I'm about to get coffee before heading to my next client. Will you do me a favor and grab some trash bags, eggs, and milk on your way to the house? Can't you get Jennifer to do it? I might be late tonight. I have to prep my next client for downsizing. - No, son. - Sir. She already has too many things on her plate. - I gotta go. - She's prepping for this big gala. Okay, Dad, I will get it on my way. Don't forget. Bye. Sorry. Can I get a medium cinnamon dolce latte with almond milk, two shots of caramel, and a shot of espresso? Mm hmm, it'll be ready over there. Taking out the trash and cashing checks is the name of the game. I own a consulting firm that helps businesses weed out dead weight in order to see possible growth. Every company has their core diehard employees that want to see the company succeed, but then you have the core management that doesn't like change. And that's where I step in, to shake shit up. Hey, Manny. It's Emmanuel, Jason. I don't know how many times I've had to tell you that. My bad, bro! Just wanted to see what you were doing tonight. I'm busy. Okay, well, you know, you've been doing such a great job with handling our account, I just figured I would invite you out. I'm sorry, I don't interact with clients on a personal basis, plus, that's not within my budget. Well, it's an expense paid by the company. And it's karaoke night, if you're down. If I'm finished with what I'm doing, I might stop by. Nice! So it's a, uh, team member date. Bye, Jason. Can I help with anything? What the? Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I just couldn't help but notice you look a little lost. Um, no, I'm just trying to figure out what type of milk to get for someone. What is this someone making? A cake, baking, something, I don't know. Vitamin D. Excuse me? Whole milk, vitamin D. It's the most commonly used milk for baking. Okay, thank you. That's what I'm here for. Excuse me, uh, sir? Do you know where the eggs and trash bags are? I've never been here before. It's all good. Eggs are gonna be at the end of the freezer section to your right, and trash bags are on aisle six. Thank you. That's funny. - Come here, you. - That's funny. Come here. Manny, my boy! Manny, thank you so much for getting that stuff for us. Oh my God, look at that, you actually got the right kind! I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. I was a little, anyway, why don't you come on in? We have Tom and Connie here. They haven't seen you in a long time. Come on in. I'd rather not. It's been a long day. Oh, come on, it'll only take a second. Plus, you gotta say hello to your moms. Ah, there's my baby! I love you. How was work? You know, work. Ah, okay, that's good. Well, guess what? Your father, your father, and Connie and Tom, we were sitting here, talking about our annual couples retreat. That sounds great. So, Manny, what are you doing this evening? Um, you know, nothing, just working on some work. Yeah, my Manny's a little anti-social. Mm mm, come on. Yeah, but making friends isn't his strong suit. Aw, poor thing. You're such a good-looking young boy. Just put yourself out there. My Manny is smart and creative and I know that he has tons of friends. Thanks. Well, what about a girlfriend? Uh, you know, I have this thing to do with a client at a bar. Oh, baby, that's so great! So you go and you have fun! And you drive safely. And, Man-Man, remember to spend the night in your hotel tonight, all right? You get me? So, anyway. There you go. ♪ You will cry ♪ Oh, hey. Oh, shit, look who it is, Jacob. What's up, brother?

I brought you here cause you passed out outside the karaoke bar. My God. Where's my phone. Whose clothes are these? Those would be my clothes. You kind of vomited on yourself last night. I can't believe this shit. Look, it's not what it looks like, and you're small but you're heavy as hell. I had a hard time cleaning you up, make sure you didn't hurt yourself. Look, I gotta get ready for work. Your clothes are almost done, and my parents cooked breakfast. Your parents saw me like that? Chill out, they didn't see you. Lucky for you, I brought you home before they got home late last night. Just get yourself together. Good morning. Good morning. Um, I never actually got your real name. I'm curious to know what's the nicknames. It's Emmanuel. Demetrius. These are my parents. Oh. Wow, okay. Well, I am glad that Demetrius was able to help you out. It's a surprise to us because he never has boys over. Or girls. Dad. Would you like something to eat? No. I'm sorry, I don't mean to make it awkward. Trey never talks to us about his sex life. Are you serious? We're gonna do this right now? I think we probably should get going. That's a good idea. We'll see you guys later. Love you. He was cute. He was. You think Trey and him are a thing? Child, that boy don't know if he straight or crooked. Not that it matters. I know, but he can't live in limbo forever. Darling, let the boy be who he wants to be. Okay, okay, I'm just saying, if he walks up in here asking questions about sexual positions, you are gonna have to have that conversation with him cause Lord knows, honey, I have tried for years. Epic fail! You are so cute when you do your mouth like that, boo. Stop. So are you calling the Uber from here? No. I would but I haven't got paid yet, so we gotta take the bus unless you wanna call them. I left my phone in the car, remember? Yeah, right. So bus it is. Do you need a ride? No, I'm good, my work's right down the street. I can walk. Okay. Hey, hey, thanks for everything. No problem. That's what I'm here for. All right, I'm a-get out your hair. Get home safe. Well, well, well, looks like somebody had a good night. Yeah, it looks like that must've been a lit party, baby. Lit, lit. Mom, just knock it off. Hold up, hold up, give us some details. Did you, um, you know... Mark, leave that boy alone. I think he needs some time to rest. Yeah, I need to go shower and lay down. Oh no, first of all, at least give us her name. Demetrius. You know what? I have a female cousin named Demetrius. Hey. Hello, buddy. I'm sorry about grilling you with all those questions a little earlier, it's just that we're just so happy to have you home. It's been such a long time. Yeah, it's been a long time. Manny, Emmanuel. Manny? Manny. All right, all right. Didn't mean to bother you and all. And you guys have a good day. Thank you. Oh, well hey, you. Hey. You found the eggs and milk all right? I'm putting myself out there and I wanted to know if you wanted to hang out some time? I feel like I need a redo after the other night. Uh, I'm down. You wanna hang out after I get off work? Yeah, if you're free. Yeah, for sure. All right. Honey, he said yes. I have somewhere I have to be. I'll catch you later. - Yeah. - Yeah. This it? Yes. So, where we going? I don't know. A bar with music? No, food first. I don't know, this is all new for me. I can tell. How about this? You drive, I'll take you to all my favorite spots. - Okay, deal. - Let's go. So, what's your story? What do you mean? I don't know, just trying to get to know you. It's not much. Born and raised in Scottsdale. Oh, so you got money, okay. My parents are good with money. They made some great financial investments. Okay. What about you? What do you mean? People have their own issues. They deal with them, that's life. Shit, who you telling? I don't know if you noticed, but I don't have the most traditional parents. Honestly, I was surprised, but happy to see a well-balanced home. Yeah, they adopted me when I was two. I don't know much about my real parents or where they're from, but Kevin and Charles are amazing replacements. I love them to death. You know, they put up with so much shit from me growing up. I remember this one time. You know what, it's not about me. We're here to get to know each other a little more, so. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I've never had a moment like this before. A moment like what? A moment to connect. Most people don't ask me how I feel, my personal thoughts, or, you know, what I've been through. But thank you for feeling comfortable enough to share that with me. Everything looks perfect on the outside. Hell, heaven seems perfect when you're standing outside the doors. Trust is such an imperfect attitude. Hey, fellas, sorry about the wait. What can I serve you guys? I'm sorry, I've never been here before. I don't know what to get. Okay, well, what are you in the mood for? I don't know. What do most people order here? I'd say our ribs are probably our bestseller. Sure, I'll have those. All right, we'll go with the ribs. And for you? Can I get the chef's special. Yeah, of course. And anything to drink? A draft beer. - Perfect. - Yes, sir. And for you? Dirty martini. All righty, well, I'll be back with those. How's the food, guys? - It was good. - Awesome. Let me get this stuff out of your way. Wait, you don't have to do that. Emmanuel, I got it. Just think of it as my way of saying thank you. Thank you for what? Thank you for allowing yourself to be open with me. Well, at least let me leave the tip. All right. Boy, you don't got nothing smaller than that? I do, but he was a good waiter. Yeah, but he didn't come with a handjob, either. - Better? - Yes. Because you're buying drinks. I just spent my whole paycheck on this dinner. So? So what? Where we going? You ever been to the Melrose District? No, what's that? You ain't never been to the Melrose District? What, what are you doing? That's my happy dance. Looked like you were having a heart attack. So why are you so happy? Because I'm about to introduce you into a whole new world. - How so? - Ah! Don't ask questions, just let me lead. And I'm driving.

I don't know, I guess I'm just blown away. Yeah. They work so hard every week to put this thing together so every once in a while, I come out in support. How'd you find out about this place? My dads. They came here all the time, performed sometimes even. So when I turned 18, they decided I needed to get a glimpse of this life. Why, did something happen? No, no. I just had questions, so many questions they couldn't even answer. So they brought me here to see for myself. Wow. Come on, don't give me that look. They sheltered me my whole entire life. And seeing them together and how much they loved each other, it made me question myself. I mean, they can't even go out and be themself without people judging them. And they care too much about what people think. Why? I don't know. To protect me. But they did teach me the true meaning of love. And that is? It's the ability to look beyond yourself, the act of transferring energy, being compatible with one more individuals effecting humankind. And you came up with that? So, do you have a girlfriend? Wow, Emmanuel. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's all right. What about you? I don't. Don't? Or would never? I can't do this! - Was I too forward? - I have to go! Emmanuel! Fuck! Boy, what is your problem? Kevin, I think there's something seriously wrong. You damn right there's something wrong. He walking up in here slamming doors like he paying bills! What the hell's wrong with him? Get up so we can go see. You better goddamn believe that. Boy! What is your problem? What is wrong with you? Hey, Trey, honey. Is everything okay? Boy, don't you hear your father talking to you? Kevin, hush. Trey, stop, stop. What is going on? He hurt me. Aw hell no! Somebody done done something to my child? Charles, Charles, where is my knife? Charles, where's my knife at? Wait, wait. Who hurt you, Trey? Stop crying, baby, and tell us what happened. I like him, Dad. Who, baby? Emmanuel. The young guy from the other night? Trey, we didn't know you were into guys. What? I thought that'd be expected. We would never expect anything like that with you. You have to make that choice for yourself. Right. We know our lifestyle's judged by the whole world, which made it very hard for both of us growing up. Racism, interracial, and being gay. Read, just read. Which is the term we used back in the day. We got through it. Trey, it doesn't matter who you like or love. Love has no labels, darling. And love does hurt, baby. I just don't know how you guys do it. No one said it was easy. There are definitely levels to this. I kissed him. This is better than that dry-ass movie we was watching. Mm hmm. I'm just so lost. I mean, I kissed him, but then he ran away all mad. I thought he was into it because he's the one who invited me out. And then there's sex with another man. I'm not sure about that, either. What? I already told you I'm not having that conversation with him if it came up. You know, whoop, there it is. What are you guys talking about? Trey, do you have any idea what sex is like with two men? Kevin! Sorry, it came out wrong. Look, this is just as uncomfortable for you as it is for me. Trey, are you the giver or the receiver? What's the difference? Oh, you see? Honey, Trey, the giver is a person who enjoys penetrating the other man, while the receiver enjoys getting penetrated. What if you wanna try both? What do y'all do? - Nope! - Too soon, too soon! Baby steps. Look, we have a catering gig that we doing tomorrow, and we are gonna need your help, so you need to get some rest. I still got questions. Questions, honey, there's no, go to bed. Bed! It's morning and I am so lost. I allowed myself too much freedom. I know I might never see Demetrius again. The feeling that rushes over me when I'm near him is unexplainable. I think I like it. But who am I? I know nothing of this way of living. Hey, Manny! Oh, baby, how are you? Good, it's great to see you. What can I make for you, baby? Oh, I got it, I'll make your favorite, Crab Benedict. Wow, you still remember. Coming right up, baby. Manny, how about you do me a favor, too? Why don't you run upstairs and make sure that that room of yours is nice and neat? No. No one's going to be going up there. Manny, get your ass upstairs and clean your room. Hi. Hi, Miss Johnson, I'm Kevin from CK Catering. We're here to get set up. I'm Charles, you have a beautiful home, Mrs. Johnson. Thank you so much. And thank you so much for coming early. I appreciate that, I really do. How many servers do you have with you this evening? Three, and we can get set up really quickly. Okay, perfect. You have guest count of 30, correct? Yes, but we might have 40. Do you think you can handle that? We can handle up to 80 individuals, so we got you covered. Thank you, okay, okay. Okay, well I'm gonna let you have at it. If you need anything at all, I have an estate manager, her name is Jennifer, feel free to call her and she'll help you out, okay? All right, darling, we'll see you later. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Look at this place. - This place is. We moving on up. Look, where's the bathroom? How you doing on that drink? Think you might get another one? Mm hmm. This time, make it a double. All right, yeah. From where I'm standing, it's never good to drink alone. I'm not alone now. Oh, I didn't mean to ruin your pity party. Excuse me? I mean, you look like you need some attention. Fuck off, I'm not in the mood. Whoa, you don't seem like the type to be so direct, but okay. Man, don't you have something better to do than just sit here and bother me? What are you scared of? I appreciate you trying to help a brother out, but I don't need this shit from no damn stranger. From where I'm standing, I've watched you for 30 minutes down five drinks, and then talk to yourself, while watching the beauty of the bartender. From my experience, I've been down this road. Can't let fear get the best of you. You have to release whatever fear has taken hold of you. Let it go. You have to pace yourself. You know what, fuck it. I'm gonna take your advice. Hey, you good? I will be. What's your name? Kobe. Thank you, Kobe. Can I have your attention, please? I would personally like to thank all of you, all of you bougie-ass bitches of Scottsdale for attending this fake-ass event. Get out of my way. You're lame. And I would personally, and I would like to give a special shot out to my beloved... Stop it! What are you doing? I'm telling my story. Manny, why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why am I doing this? Look around, you're trying to ruin us? Am I trying to ruin us? Your husband ruined us when he raped me. Manny, that is nonsense! That never happened! My husband, your father, would never, ever do such a thing. Calm down, Manny, it's not true. No! You just don't wanna believe it! Manny, calm down. All of those late night talks weren't talks at all. He raped me. Come on, baby. And you weren't there to save me, Mom. You weren't there to save me. Manny. Manny, I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know, I didn't know, oh my God. Get off of me, get off! Manny. Get off! Manny, Manny, Manny, Manny, Manny, that was a long time ago. Why don't we talk about this some other time? I will never talk to you! Oh my God, oh my God. Let me go! I know your life wasn't painted on the right canvas, but you still got time to make your own masterpiece. Let me go! Hey, look at me. Look at me. Look, I knew since the first time I saw you at the store, I don't know how, but we would be in each other's lives. How could you like somebody who's so broken and lost? I just wanna die. Come on, don't say that. Who said I'm not broken? Those are the only parents you're gonna get, man. They're not my parents! They don't love me. No, they just don't understand. But I get you. But I got you. Emmanuel, hey, look, I got you. I got you, Emmanuel. Come on, it's gonna be all right. You'll be all right. Be cool. Calm down. You'll be all right, all right? Are you sure you wanna do this, Trey? Yes, Dad, I'm sure. I need to try something new. Oh, baby, I'm so happy for you. The moment that he fucks up, you better let me know. I will. And I mean that. I love you guys. Bye. Hey. Are you sure you wanna do this? I've never been more certain that my journey begins with you.
