"...to move out and leave Staten Island forever." Good morning, what you doin'? Besides stalking JP of course? I'm reading the news, thank you very much. Oh, you're reading the news, you're such a good liar. Seriously, how do you know I'm stalking JP? Because I know you very very well. Oh, wait, did you tell your mom about CalArts yet? Yeah, I told her. She's super excited for me to move across the country and go to a really expensive art school. Really? - No. - No? No, I haven't found, I haven't found the right time to tell her. Oh, Nerve is starting. Sorry, this is really important. - What's Nerve? - It's a game. Here, just click on the video. Welcome to Nerve New York City. Nerve is a 24-hour game, like Truth or Dare, minus the Truth. Watchers pay to watch. Players play to win, cash and glory. Are you a watcher or a player? Are you a watcher or a player? Are you a watcher or a player? It's cool, right? This looks very sketchy. Is this legal? I don't know, probably not. Just do it, just sign up and watch, time’s ticking. Okay, signing up. Look, this is me signing up to watch you. Vee, you have to sign up and watch me. It's very important that l have Watchers. - Hey! - I gotta go. My mom just got home. - Just do it. - l'll sign up after breakfast, - I promise. - Thank you, I love you, - I'll see you in a little bit. - Bye. Bye. I mean Syd hasn't gotten into any schools yet. And she doesn't even care. You know what, Sydney doesn't have to care, she has a trust fund. And you have something far more valuable than that. Here we go. You have drive, you have focus. You have a scholarship to a local college. And even though we can't afford the dorm, you get to have me as your new college roommate. Actually, I, um... I have kind of a cool idea about that. What if we fixed up Mike's room and listed you on Airbnb or something. Maybe it's time we finally go through his stuff and maybe give some of it to Goodwill. - And I could give you some space. - I don't want space. | just want you. Okay. I'm totally down with commuting. I can get my reading done on the ferry. Yeah? That'll work, right? Yeah. Let's say, "Go Cougars" on the count of one, two three! Go Cougars! Let's go, Cougars! Let's go, Cougars! Let's go, Cougars! - Hand me the zoom lens. - Here. Doesn't it feel a little unbalanced if every single yearbook photo is of JP Guerrero? It's not my fault he's on the team. - Alright, boys, here we go! - Here. Alright, careful, careful. Let's hit it, JP! Alright, let's go, let's go! Come on! Watch out, watch out, watch out! Yeah, you got it. Alright, be careful! Let's go, Cougars! Let's go, Cougars! Let's go, Cougars! Liv, Liv! Let's show them what we got, Cougars! Okay, let's play foot-- Where you goin', Syd? Okay, we lost our cheerleader. Alright, let's show 'em what we got VHS! Are you ready, remember what to do? Okay. - Okay, you're on! - Hey, watchers! It's Syd Baby. I'm counting on you to get me to the ﬁnal round. So don't let me down and I won't let you down, l promise. Let's go, VHS! Go, dude, show 'em what we got! Show 'em what Staten Island's really about! Go cheer, baby! How 'bout that ass, though? Okay, thank you, Sydney. You guys dared me to eat dog food. You can do this, just don't think about it. This is so gross, this is so gross. Okay, keep it in. Wassup, Watchers? Money, money. - l have so many Watchers now. - Yeah, you do, girl! I just need to get in that little box thing. Who’s winning now? Apparently, this guy named Ryan. I guess he put peanut butter on his junk and let his dog lick it off. - What? - I could do that. But you don't have a dog. - I could still do it. - Or a dick, Liv. They're coming up with your next dare! What is it? I need something flashy like the peanut butter thing. Hey. Oh, my God, how weird. How do they know you're afraid of heights? - What? - That's what they do, it's easy. They just take all your info from your old profiles and put it in your Nerve profile. - That's so creepy. - You just got suspended. - I thought you were done playing Nerve. - Hell no! The girl who won Seattle now has millions of followers. - She is insta-famous. - Who cares? I care, Vee. I don't expect you to understand. I'm an adrenaline junkie. You like to stay within your comfort zone, that's fine. That's not true. What about that pole dancing class we took? Vee, I dragged you there and you sat in the corner and watched. - I'm a visual learner. - Why are you attacking her? - I'm not attacking her, Tommy. - Yeah, you are. Life is passing you by. You need to learn to take a few risks every once in a while. - I do take risks. - Really? Okay, fine. Let's just say, hypothetically, you're playing Nerve. What'd be a good Nerve dare for Vee? Baby steps, baby steps. Just talk to JP. What? He probably likes you, too. You'll just never know if you don't talk to him. And then everybody that's watching you they would just go on and vote. Who wants to see Vee mackin' on JP? - Oh, my God! - You guys! All who wanna see Vee macking on JP say "Yes." Yes! Yes, yes. - I assume, "No"? - Abstain. Do you accept your dare, Vee? Say, "Yes." Say, "Yes." What's the point? We're graduating, l-- - All you have to do is say, "Hi." - I don't want to say "Hello" to him. Fine. I love you so much, Vee, but you're a Watcher. So watch me do it for you. - No no no, Syd, Syd, Syd. - Just watch. No, no, no, Syd, no. Yeah, Sydney! Why don't you show us the front next time? You first, Chuck. I hear it's really big. Guess it's average. - Hey, JP. - What's up? l was wondering, do you have a girlfriend right now? No! It's not for me, it's for a friend. Well, which friend? No, she's not my type. You're not nearly as hot as you think you are. - Yes, he is! - And you are a douchebag. No, don't go, come on. Vee, Vee! Just let her go. Not cool, Sydney. I'm just trying to help her. - Let's not help her. - She'll figure it out. Hello, welcome to Nerve. You have chosen Player. Nerve is a direct democracy. Watchers decide your dares. The two Players with the most Watchers by the end of regulation will advance to the ﬁnal round where the winner takes all. Watchers can watch from anywhere but they are encouraged to ﬁlm live. So don't be alarmed. There are three rules: One, all dares must be ﬁlmed on the Player’s phone. Two, there are only two ways to be eliminated. Fail or bail. Three, snitches get stitches. Thank you for keeping Nerve a secret. Good luck, Player. Hey, it’s Vee, I'm not here right now-- Vee, you have to sign up and watch me. ...for account information, press one. For phone or credit card information... - Tommy. - Hey, I’m pulling up outside. What the hell's so urgent? We have to go to Colonnade Diner, we have 15 minutes. Why, what's going on? | signed up for Nerve and that's where my first dare is. What do you mean, you signed up as a Player? Oh, man. What, is that so hard to believe? You know that some kid supposedly died in Seattle playing Nerve? I don't buy that. If kids were dying, the game would be shut down. No, they can't shut it down. There's not a single server. What does that mean? Everybody that logs onto the game becomes a new server. So it's impossible to turn the game off. How do you even know so much about this game? You've never even played. Oh a lot of time on the dark web? - Is that right, hacker boy? - Yes, that is right. You're only accessing ten percent of the Internet, you know. Why are you even doing this? Seriously, it's dangerous. Is it because of Sydney? This is not about Sydney. I'm... It's just not like you. That's the point. Kiss a stranger for ﬁve seconds? A stranger, Vee, I'll give you 100 dollars. Okay, okay. You're just gonna kiss some random person? He has a girlfriend. Just kiss that guy. - Okay, I'm gonna kiss that guy. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Gonna do it. Or that guy, he reads. Well, make a choice, clock's ticking. - Hi. - Hey. I'm kissing that guy. Okay, you sit here, tell me when you're rolling, okay? Okay, it's Mission Impossible now? Just go. To... To the Lighthouse, that's my favorite book. Really? Please, tell me they get to the lighthouse in the end. Actually, don't tell me. Okay, just tell me real quick. Yeah, they do, but that's, that's not really what it's about. The lighthouse means something different to each of the characters. It basically represents the thing they want most in life. And I'm sorry that I'm totally geeking out and ruining the story. No, I was the one who asked. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi. Done. Done.Done. - Okay. - Okay, bye. Oh, my God, I can't believe I just did that! - Gosh, why am I embarrassed? - Did you get it? Yeah, it was a miniseries, I got all six episodes. - Where did he go? - I have no clue. "Vee, $100 has been wired to your account." - Should I check? - You should totally check. Every time I look into your lovely eyes - What is he doing? - I have no clue. I see a love that money just can 't buy One look from you l drift away And l pray - He's singing to me. - No, it's a dare, it's a dare. Are here to stay Anything you want you've got it Anything you need you've got it Anything at all you got it Baby, you got it - Thank you. - Good job. You won your dare, congratulations. Back at ya. Mine was totally embarrassing, but at least I got 100 bucks, right? I'm sorry, I promise I didn't know what was comin'. - Do you mind? - Sorry, I'm sitting here. They just told me to sit in that booth and-- Sorry. Some kid came by and gave me that book. To the Lighthouse, yeah, my favorite. Exactly because it's on your Facebook page. They know all the information about you, Vee. Your name's Vee? - Short for Venus. - I like that. Her parents, they named her after the Goddess of Love. There's a Roman myth. Yeah, I guess my mom was expecting somebody else. I dunno about that. That was some kiss. I got a game to play but good night to you guys. Thank you. What? Apparently the Watchers like us together. I mean, you can't even go to the city, right? You know, I can't go to the city, yeah. I'm not even playing, I was just doing one dare. - Are you sure? It's 200 bucks. - She's pretty sure, man. He always tell you what to do? No, no, he doesn't. I'm gonna be outside if you change your mind. It's nice to meet you, Vee. See ya, man. He thought that those were our fries. - I could use 200 bucks. - Vee, you're not going to the city. You said one dare. I'm sorry. You know what, Charles Manson was a singer. I was hoping you'd come. I'm just warning you, I don't think I'd make a very good partner. I'm not the daredevil type. You should team up with my friend Sydney actually. She's obsessed with playing Nerve. But the Watchers want me to team up with you. The second I feel uncomfortable, I'm out. That's fair. Okay. Hold on. I just have to go to the bathroom. Excuse me, ladies? Ladies? Hey, where are you going? Please, let me fart on you, please! - Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! - Oh, my God. - It's going up so fast! - I know. Who's your favorite Player? Well, I mean, I was gonna say you, but now I don't know. Is that Vee? Yeah, she's playing and she has, like, a lot of Watchers. Oh, my God, girl! - Hey, try screaming. - No. You can do it, let it out! There you go. Alright, this is it. Am I supposed to come in with you? Doesn't say anything about that. Well, thank you for the lift. You gonna be okay? Yeah, yeah, no, I'm tired, so I'm probably just gonna make my way back home. This is fun. - Yeah. - I just gotta... you know. Okay. You got three more steps. If you keep up the exercises, you're gonna get really strong on that. Excellent. Thanks, Miss. Somebody's sending Vee money. White people problems. What is she doing? And you have your receipt. So thank you so much for shopping at Bergdorf's. - You have a wonderful day. - Excuse me, sorry. Do you know where I can find this dress? Your mom's calling. Shit! That's very expensive. - Couture, fourth floor. - Thanks. Please, don't undress the mannequin. - Sorry. - Would you like to try this on? Let me see if! have it in your size. Thank you. If you could hurry up, I'm a little bit late for a party. Cute. Okay, right this way. If you need anything else, just let me know. - Okay, thank you. - Oh, alright. Okay, dressed. Hello? - Everything okay? - Everything is great, thank you. Hey, what's your email number? I mean your... What's your info? Oh, this, this old thing? Vee! Hey. Hi. You look very pretty. Thanks, so do you. I mean you look, you know, hot, or handsome or... Do you know what we're supposed to do now? The Watchers would like me to complete your ensemble, mademoiselle. Neither, is that an option? Alright, how 'bout my firstborn son, too? What are you doing, Vee? - How much are they, sir? - That'll be $900, madam. In that case I'll take two. One for the city and one for the Hamptons. Excellent choice, mademoiselle. I'll wrap them up for you right away. I'll see ya downstairs? - Yeah, sure. - Okay, alright. What? Excuse me, Miss, did you move my clothes in there? Of course not. This is not happening. Vee? Vee? - Ian. - Hey. Did you take my stuff? I mean, my wallet, my clothes, everything's gone. No, my stuff is gone, too. - No. - Okay... - No, no. - Come on, we have to make a run for it. - Come on, let's go. - I am not shoplifting! We don't have a choice, come on! Okay, technically, it just says we have to leave the store. Right? Let's go. Come on, come on, let's go! Sorry, buddy, we need to come through, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me! Let's go, come on, come on. Whoa, whoa, hey, stop, stop, stop! Please, tell me these are our clothes! - They kind of are. - Are these stolen? Receipt. - We get to keep ’em? - All yours. Hey, can I get the check? Who paid for these? Probably, one of the Watchers with daddy's credit card. - What? - Look! Dolla dolla bill, y'all! I'm sorry, was that a Wu-Tang reference? - Staten Island, represent! - Okay. Saint Mark's, ten minutes? Hello. Tommy, what does Vee think she's doing? Have you ever parked a car in your life? I got this, girl. l have no idea, Syd. Why are you asking me, I'm not her boyfriend. Well, who's this biker she's teamed up with? l have no clue, she just ditched me. She's doing what she apparently thinks is best for herself. Yeah, and what exactly is that? Sydney, Syd, Vee is in the top 10. - What? - She's in the top 10. Tommy, Vee is in the top 10? - Yeah, I know. - How is that even possible? - How many Watchers does she have? - Like 4,471. - How many do I have? - 6,806. Oh, okay, I have a lot more. Tommy, I really don’t think that Vee can handle this. - I 'm actually really worried about her. - Yeah, me too. So get your ass to this party and help me, okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way. What happens if I bail? You lose everything you've already made. My mom would kill me. What do you want to do? Okay, just please no fire breathing dragons or knives, no clowns, no snakes, no skeletons. What about panthers and tornadoes? - No. No. - No? Okay. Whoa, what about this? Just a tattoo of my dad. He's gorgeous, honestly, he's a nice looking guy. Okay, I got a better idea, here we go. You're gonna draw it, no! Be quiet, I gotta concentrate. Back off. Okay. Can you do something like this but less shitty? - Yes! - Yeah? Right, I'm laughing 'cause it's good. You guys, come on. You have to trust us, that's the whole thing. Gotta trust me. And dirt beard. Okay, okay. Okay, you can stop. You can stop, I think we're good, we’re good. The dare said it just had to be bigger than a quarter. This deﬁnitely feels bigger than a quarter. You're doing great, it's almost done. Okay, no, I think wherever we're at it, we can stop. Hold on, I'm just doing the "Y" in daddy. - What? - He's kidding, don't listen to him. I really don't like that noise at all. Oh, my God. - Rocking that gold tooth. - I forget the rest. Okay, okay. Ow! Wu-Tang fan, huh? My brother used to listen to them all the time. Oh, yeah, you have a brother? I had a brother. He died right before starting college. I'm sorry. How long ago was that? Two years ago, he was 18. This July, I'll be older than him. Older than my older brother. Hey, hey, come on. Stay with me, stay with me. He was just one of those people that wasn't afraid of anything. He always said yes. He would laugh so hard if he saw me getting a tattoo right now. Boom, I'm done! Go to that mirror and you celebrate my work. - Come on, let's go. - Do I want to see it? Yes, yes, yes. - Hey. - What's up, young Jedi? - Yeah, hi, hey. - We miss you down here at the club. - You're watching Nerve, right? - Yeah, man, we all are. Alright, I'm trying to find out more about this Ian guy. Ian, my dude, he playing with your little girlfriend, Vee, right? Could be you but you ain't playing. Alright, yes, that's the problem though but I'm looking on his profile and there's just nothing on the guy. - Well, did you try Google? - Yeah, I tried Google. I guess he's a ghost then. Look, I need to take it to Aruba. - What, no. - Yes, come on. No way, you're not ready for that shit. - Yes, I know. - You're gonna mess up my rating. I'm not gonna mess up your rating. I'm not gonna buy guns or something, man. Tommy no, not happening. Look, I'm just worried about my friend, please. - Come on. - Alright, I'll send you a pass key. Alright, thank you. A lighthouse? I love it, thank you. Well, a very wise person once said, and this was earlier today, they said that the lighthouse represents the thing that you want the most. So, whatever that is, I hope you get it. How many followers does she have now? I mean, to be fair, you did tell her to take a risk. This isn't what I meant, Liv. This is ridiculous. Sydney. Okay, now they're asking if I can trust you. Can I? l have the perfect tattoo picked out for you. Wait, wait, wait. - No, okay, it’s not a tattoo dare. - What is it? Just says go to Park and 25th. Oh, God, I love the internet. What? What? Ian's played before? - You don ’t have to do this. - I can do this. - You don 't have to do this. - I can do this. Hey, it’s Vee, I'm not here right now. So, leave a mess-- Here we go. Get to 60 miles per hour. - That's it. - Okay. Alright? Easy one, alright, let's do this. What did that just say? Blindfolded? On the motorcycle. Yeah? - You're on your own with that one. - Wait, I can't do this alone. Come on, I need you to help me navigate. There's no way in hell I'm doing that. I'm sorry, I'm out. Thank you for tonight. I had a lot of fun, got a new dress... But... I'm good. Stay, let's see what else happens. Yo, what's up guys? Veenus, I love your wardrobe. Could you hold that for me? Hold it, hold it up. Great. Hey, Ian, see you in the finals. Who was that guy? I don't know, just another player. Vee come on, do this with me. Please, I need you. Look, you'd be in control. Say, yes, just say yes. You got next? Who wants to challenge the champ? Liv. - No way. - Hey, Liv, come on. Sydney. - Sydney. - What? Oh, my God, you're not gonna believe this. What? Are you kidding me? - Are you ready? - Yeah. Now remember, you're my eyes. Okay... Green. Hold on. - You okay? - Yeah. - Just keep your eyes open. - Okay, okay, okay. Hey, I know you're scared but you gotta talk to me, Vee. Okay, wait, no, no, no. We got this, Vee. What's going on, what's going on? - Are we good, are we good? - Taxi to the right, right, right. - You've a sticker on your helmet. - Thank you. Okay, you're leaning to the left... - Are you crazy? - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, too far left, right, right, right. Okay, I think that worked, yeah? Are we good? - Actually, yes. - Okay, keep doing that. Just lean? Yeah, lean left or right, you are in control. That's good. No way she's doing this. - This is good, you're doing great. - Okay, speed up. Yes, ma'am. Okay, 30, we're half way there. Okay, the next light is green. - The next Iight's green. - Good, good, I got this. Okay, next light is... Come on, stay with me, what's going on? Next light is green, faster. No, no, no, no, no. Green. - We're doing this Vee. - Sixty seconds. - Are we clear now? - Still clear. Taxi, taxi. Take it home, Vee, take it home, Vee. - Time check! - Fifteen seconds! - Speed. - Forty-six, 47. Hey, guys, we love you. - Love you too. - Let's go. Fifty-seven, 58, 59, 60! We did it! - Oh, shit! - Look out! - Hold on! - Oh, my God! Vee's number one. Oh, my God. That was the craziest thing I've ever done! - You were incredible, I wanna like... - I can't even believe we did that. Oh, Vee, get it girl. Oh, yeah. Are you hungry at all? - Pizza? - Pizza, I swear I was gonna say pizza. Hey, Watchers. Okay, listen. You and I both know that I should be in that box, so please stop holding back, okay? You guys don 't need to be afraid because I'm not afraid, so just give me a real dare. - What's up, Syd, baby? - What are you doing here? You're a good Player. You've got a lot of Watchers, I got a lot of Watchers. Maybe we could team up. I don't need a partner. Seems to work for your friend Vee. - What up, Syd, you alright? - Yeah, we're just talking. Yo, Mad Max, why don't you show yourself out, man? Call me. Break down. Captain. Party on, man! Hey, Nancy. Tommy, listen, I have a quick question. How would I know if I’m being hacked? - What do you mean? - Hacked. Somebody's been depositing money into my account under Vee's name. That doesn't sound like a hack. Normally, they would take money out, if they were hacking you. Thomas, what are you not telling me? Oh, it must... It might be Vee got a job. - What, a job? - Yeah, that's probably it. - She did an online poker thing. - Okay. And she's really great at it. - Is it legal? - Yeah, it's legal and she's doing great, as you can tell with the deposits but anyway, I gotta go, I'm writing a paper right now on motorcycle safety. - I'm gonna get going but-- - Well, tell her to call me. - Bye. - Bye. Wanna take a ride? - Is this a dare? - It's a carousel. So, why are you playing Nerve? Trying to help out my family. Some things happened that I wish turned out differently. Like what? This is just kind of something I need to do, so... We got some paparazzi. Hide. What, who is it? So, that's Sydney. Are you going to get it? I don 't want to deal with her right now. Ouch. What's going on? She's just been odd recently, but, whatever, you don't wanna talk about that. If you want to talk about it I'm here. I'm happy to listen. I'm just tired of being her sidekick all the time. That's funny, you don't seem like anyone's sidekick. Could I see that picture again? Sure. - Wow. - Yeah, guys go crazy for her. No, I mean, the picture itself, it's really good. - Thanks, I took it. - Yeah? You have a good eye. I just, I can't picture you hanging out with someone like this. What do you mean? I don't know, she looks kind of insecure. - Is that mean? - She is, totally insecure. I mean, she makes it seem like I'm the one who's insecure but really it's her. - It's exhausting. - I'm sure. She's at this party, most likely drunk, and needs me to hold her hair back. I 'm just over it. I mean, so are her parents. They're constantly out of town, so she has this revolving door of guys over. It's sad actually. Hey, that party. Should we maybe go check it out? What? Why would I want to go to that party? Maybe... show off your new tattoo? Show Sydney that you're not the person she thinks you are? Hey, watch out. Okay, okay, I got this, okay. Go, Sydney. Come on, Syd, you're better than this. - Come on, just turn around. - Come on, Syd, you got this. Come on Syd, you started it, you got to finish it. Come on, you got it, you got it. Sydney, deep breath. - Just take a deep breath, Sydney. - It's alright. Get in here, she's gonna do it. - I got this, okay. - There you go, come on. There you go, there you go. Come on Syd, you got this. Liv, Liv, Liv, come, come, come. - Excuse me, excuse me. - Oh, my God. Sydney. - Be careful, be careful, Syd. - What are you doing? Oh, my God. You don't have to do this, come back. Shut up. Sydney, come back. Come on, yeah, there you go. - You don't have to do this. - Take your time, Syd, don't look down. This is a stupid game. Come on, we're right here. You can always turn back, Syd. Come on, come on, you got to film. Sydney, it's not gonna count unless you film it. Don't worry about the phone. She has to film it, she can't-- It doesn't count unless she films it, she has to film it. - Just bail and come back. - She has to film it. - No, but she has to film it. - Shut up, Chuck. Oh, my God. I can't, oh, my God, I can't, I can't. Sydney, you got to get up, you gotta do something. Stop yelling at me, stop. She has to get it done. Shut up. This is gonna take too long. You got to stand, you got to walk. Shut up! Shut up, Chuck. You heard her, Chuck shut up. She's gotta get it done. She's not gonna get here in time unless she gets up and walks. She has to, she's wasting time. Shut up both of you. Come on Syd, you got this. I can't, I can't, I can't. I bail, I bail, I bail. You bail. - You fail. - Someone help him out of there. You fail. This is so dumb. - Hey, come here, hold on. - You fail. What are you doing, get over here. Vee. Hi, oh, my gosh, you guys are so famous right now. Oh, wait till Syd sees you. - Where is she? - Oh, you guys don't know? Yeah, she tried to walk across that ladder and just bailed. - Is she out of the game? - Yeah, let's get a drink. Yeah, it wasn't pretty. - Have you seen Sydney? - Yeah. Syd. Oh, come on, Vee, you never even spoke to him. It's fine, certainly no surprise. Sorry. Yeah, I know it's not a surprise. You know what's not fine though. I almost died tonight, Vee, and you were nowhere to be found. I'm sorry, when you said I should live my life, did you mean I should live my life in your shadow? I was just trying to help you, Vee, because you're the most repressed person that I know. Wasn't that why you keep me around? Because I never tell you the truth? - Yeah. - Come on, let's go. I guess you don't tell me the truth. Because you never told me about how insecure I am. Or about how I just have a revolving door of guys all the time. You never tell me that but you've told everyone that tonight. So please, Vee, go right ahead and show us all what a fiery little spark plug you've become since lunch. Let's go. Shots fired. Don't walk away from me, Vee. Wake up, this is a game. Do you really think that someone like him is actually gonna be with you when this is all done? Wait, you don't know me. Oh, I'm sorry, you really like her now? Yeah, I do. Alright, come on Syd, you're just drunk. Tommy, it is time to get over her. Clearly she has traded up. Why do you have to be such a bitch? Look at that, little Vee finally speaking her mind. Come on, unburden yourself. You know why we're best friends? I do whatever you want all the time. No, Vee. We 're friends because I'm fun and you're boring. The only fun thing about you was your brother. What is it you think? That playing Nerve is just gonna magically make you a different person? That's not how life works, you'll never be a player. Right, right. I know how much you love living in the moment, Syd. Well remember this moment because you're one of those girls who peaks in high school. And you wake up one day still living in Staten Island, still screwing the same guys, wondering what the hell happened to your life. If you want to know where I am from now on, sign up and watch me. Wait, Vee, what are you doing? Hey, hey, Vee, you don't need to do this. Look at me, come on, let's just go. Let's bail, alright? What do you have to prove? Come on, please, let's go. You got it, Vee, please. Go, girl! Oh, my God, Vee. Whoa! That'll take you into first, Vee! That was messed up. I can't deal with this right now, I'm gonna go. Vee, do you know that he's played Nerve before? What? Yeah, it was his dare to get you here and fight with Syd. That's why he brought you here. Look. Do you still trust him? Vee, wait, wait. - Is it true? - Is what true? Did you take me here as part of the game? Answer me, is it true? - What are you doing? - It's more complicated than that. | just lost my two best friends tonight. - I know. - How much did you get for that? No, no, it's not about the money, alright? But I promise, I'll explain to you later. Just don't even bother, okay? I mean, Sydney almost died tonight. - I almost died tonight. - Vee, I know, I know. This game is sick, I'm going to the police. Wait, no, no, no. - I'm sorry. - What are you doing? I'm sorry, you can't do that, alright? You can't go to the police. Why not? Because I'll lose the game? No, it's not about that. Vee, Vee. You can't go to the police. It's the last thing you wanna do. Vee, wait, I wasn't trying to hurt you. It just got out of control. Move, just get out of my way. Officer! Officer, officer, I need help. I'm playing this game, it's called Nerve. And I'm worried that someone's gonna get really hurt. Snitch. - That game, are they playing too? - Yeah. Dude, get out of this. Is there a crime being committed? No, but a kid could die tonight. Look, here, it's all on my phone, you can see. What? What? Snitch! Snitch! - Mom? - Honey, what's going on? - Mom! - Vee, where are you? All the money is missing from our account! - Wait, what? - Vee, honey, are you in trouble? Can you just please tell me what's going on? Okay, Mom, I'm gonna fix this I promise. Fix what? Hello? Vee, hello, Vee? I'm sorry but I got to win this game. Hello, Vee. You broke the rules, you are our prisoner. We told you not to snitch. Now we control your life. We control your family. We control your future. The only way out is to win the ﬁnal round. Go to the Staten Island ferry and the Watchers will ﬁnd you. See you in the ﬁnals, see you in the ﬁnals... I'm coming for you, Vee! - Vee, thank God, are you okay? - Am I okay? No, I'm not okay. You need to tell me everything. - Okay, what the hell is going on? - Come here, come here. Why is this happening to me? That guy, Ty, we both played Nerve last year in Seattle. We got a dare to hang from a construction crane, 200 feet in the air. The two of us and this kid named Robby. Five, four, three Come on, Robby, that's enough. - Got it? - Shit, he's slipping. Two, one. Come on, grab my hand, man, grab my hand. Ty and I, we bailed and we went to the cops. We tried to get the game shut down but they didn't do anything. No, they just called it an accident. Then, the Watchers came after us for snitching. But they messed with my dad's job, they leaked photos of my sister online, they stole our identities, Vee. Me and Ty, we became prisoners of the game. Oh, come on, what does that even mean? It's the third category. Watcher, Player, Prisoner. I'm trapped. The only way out is to win. - So, you have to win. - No... No, you do. - What? - Vee, you're a Prisoner now. Okay, you and I, we're going to the final round together and I'm gonna lose. - What, no, you can't do that. - It's already done, it's already done. I told the Watchers to give me a dare that's gonna knock Ty out of second place. It's gonna be me and you. - I have to go. - No, no, no. Okay, I wanna take you somewhere safe, let's go. There has to be another way. There isn't. If it's not me in the finals, then it's Ty and he'll do anything to win. Just tell me we're gonna do this. Hey, it's not your fault. l just hope she's okay. - Hello? - Guys, it's me. Oh, my God, Vee, where are you? I'm so sorry. It doesn't matter, I'm just glad you're okay. - Alright, guys, come on, let's go. - I can't. What? I have to finish this. Are you insane? Vee, what are you talking about? It's never gonna end, I mean, even if they live me alone, they're just gonna do it to somebody else. We can't stop the game if we wanted to. There's no one to stop. It's just a bunch of anonymous people. What if they weren't anonymous? Ian’s doing a dare that will put him to the ﬁnal, so it could be me against him. Vee, do you actually trust this guy? He's the person who got you into this mess in the first place. I got me into this mess. Anything Ian's doing now is to help me get out. I know it sounds crazy but I can do it. I just need your help. What do you need us to do? Tommy, you said the game is open source, right? Do you think you can change the code? It's gonna take time. Syd, could you buy us some? Hey, now climb the cranes. Syd. - Yeah? - Use a pay phone. Hang for ﬁve seconds. Hang with one hand, hang with one hand. Shit. One, two, three... ...four, five! It's over here, Tommy. You don 't have a lot of time. Okay, yeah, we're on our way, we'll see you soon. How did it go? - It went. - It went? Yeah, I think it's gonna work. Yeah, better work. What is this place? Fastest Internet in New York City. - Hey, Tommy! - Hey, HK, we made it. - Let's get this started, you ready? - Is the botnet up and running? Yeah, of course. We just gotta enter it into the system. Oh and this is Sydney, obviously. Hey, welcome to the cloud. Sucks you got axed. Alright, let's take this game down. Okay, how's this gonna work? It's like Wikipedia, where anyone can edit the code but the majority has to approve it. And the botnet can outvote everyone. Yo, I got a army of bots here waitin' for orders. - Hey, Nancy. - Where is Vee, what is this game? - Don 't worry, she's okay. - I want you to explain it to me. I'm gonna give you an address. Okay, if you meet me here, I'll explain everything. Ticket. Better hurry up. Guys, it's starting! Vee, Vee, Vee, Vee. Players, stop! Back up. Stop. Alright, how many bots do we got in? Not enough yet, but we are getting there. Players, show us your weapons. First to shoot wins. 20 seconds on the clock. 20 seconds? HK, I need backup! - Begin. - Do it. Start by just raising your gun. Just raise your gun slowly. Then shoot me in the shoulder, I'll be fine. What if I miss? I don't know if I can do this. Oh, come on, just shut up and play the game! Vee, you have to hurry, alright? You have to do this, this is the only way the game can end and then you can walk away. Five, four, three, two, one. I'm not doing this. Vee, don't, you can't... I'll do it! Oh, shit. They're onto us, they're blockin' all of our foreign IPs. Tommy, do something! Did y'all miss me? And I say we do that dare again. With someone who's really ready to play. Yeah! Don't do it, Ty, it's not worth it, man. Stop! Whoa, whoa, back up. You have lost your mind, pretty boy, get back! Is this what you really want? For us to kill each other? - Yeah! - Of course that's what you want. Kill 'em! You think that takes nerve? Why don't you take off your masks and show yourselves, huh? You, take off your mask. Yeah, what's your name? It's easy for you to be brave in a crowd. Hiding behind your screen names. Don't you guys see that you're all still responsible for what happens tonight even if you are just watching? Oh, my God, are you really believing this bullshit? Play to win! You guys really want one of us to die, for a game? Yes, yes! Then shoot me. I dare you. Okay. Who wants me to shoot her? Vee, what are you doing? Who wants me to shoot her? - Tommy, where's Vee? - Alright, calm down. What is this game, I want answers. What are you doing? You better tell me right now or I'm calling the cops. - No, no cops. - No, Nancy, calm down. Do you want me to shoot her? - Shoot to kill, shoot to kill! - Then vote "Yes." Vote "Yes" if you want me to shoot her! - Don't say "Yes!", say "No!" - You want me to shoot her? You want me to shoot her? Come on guys, "No!" Guys, vote "No"! You, vote "Yes", vote "Yes"! Let me know, vote "Yes"! Come on, let's have a little bit of anarchy. Alright, we're getting around them. The IPs are coming in faster now. Vee, we need to go, right now! Oh, my God! Okay, alright, come on, guys, keep it going. Oh, my God, Vee. Vee, please, please. No, no, no. Look at me, Vee, please! Go. That's my real name. No, wait, stop, stop! My God! It's okay, it's okay! Stop, it's okay, I'm okay. It's okay. Oh, my God! Sorry. You were in on this? It was her plan, man, her friend Sydney called me. That's why I'm here. The gun, what? Blanks, bro. It's fake. Oh, my God! You scared me. We cool? Yeah, we're free. She's a badass, watch out for her. - That's it, the last Player's out. - Did we get it? They're out, think it’s crashing! - We got it? - And Nerve is officially offline! We have gamed the game. You guys are the dumbest smart kids I've ever met. - I'm so sorry. - No no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for bringing you into all this. I just wish that we could've met some other way. I don't. Oh, man! And you. What a rock star. Looks like I can get all your money back. They don't call me Hacker Kween for nothin'. - Really? Thanks. - Yeah. - Crazy first date, huh? - Is that what that was? By the way, my real name is Sam. Well, it's nice to meet you, Sam. It's nice to meet you, Vee. Hey, Vee, it’s 28 degrees in New York!
