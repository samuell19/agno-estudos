Good evening, warden. I see your blood forth your closest ribs. You are about to become a non-person, Shadow. You have no idea how right you are. Fuck you! Shadow! Deliver us life! Edward Markeen, aka Shadow. Convicted of 22 counts of capital murder. Including four police officers. 12 counts of rape. 9 counts of double homicide. Mothers and unborn children. I waited a long time for this. It's time, Father. They were banished from among men. With an outcry like that against thief. To dwell on the slopes, the bodies in caves send stone. Love the bushes they raise, their eyes crying. Under the nettles they hurtle together. Irresponsible... devious... men. They retrieve it. Ouch. What happened? God has fled. Hell reigns. Darkness prevails! What a hell happened down there? What a fuck? That's the south block! Fire! SHADOW DEAD RIOT SHADOW KILLER AT LARGE 7th VICTIM OF SHADOW KILLER BIZARRE BLOOD RITUAL 3rd PREGNANT WOMAN FOUND DRAINED OF BLOOD. SHADOW KILLER CAUGHT DRINKING BLOOD OF EXPECTING MOTHERS FOR IMMORTALITY SHADOW KILLER SCHEDULED FOR LETHAL INJECTION 20 YEARS LATER ELLIS GLEN EXPERIMENTAL REHABILITATION FACILITY FOR WOMEN What's going on baby. I'll be seeing you later. Welcome to Ellis Glen. We have a small group of wonderful ladies here. We're not about punishment. Oh, no. We are about spiritual rehabilitation through physical improvement. A diet regimen and a work regimen. As you can see this place could use a little physical improvement itself. Work is good for the soul. It'll be good for yours. I understand you like to call yourself Solitaire. Don't try to go this alone. Do yourself a favour and help us help you. Take her to admitting. Well, you're gonna have to get used to this. It's a vitamin shot. It's part of Danvers health plan. You seem a little tense. Perhaps a little massage just might help you feel a little better. All right! All right, let me up! All right, we're finished here. For today... Looking good, honey! You must be Danvers new girl. I like to say she puts the hell in health. I'm Emily. But lately everyone's been calling me Preggers. I guess I should be grateful, right? Like Danvers all health thing. It's gotta be good for the baby. So what's your story? I heard them call you Solitaire, why is that? Because I prefer to be alone. It's gonna be tough around here. Around here it's all about the team spirit. And I'm sure they've already told you that. My Steve was a loner. They called him a murderer on the news but that's not who he is. He didn't mean to shoot that guy. He just panicked, that's all. All I did was drive the getaway car. I wonder how tough she really is. So why don't you take her on to find out? Then I won't have to kick your skinny little ass all the time. Hello! Soap. You! Yo, I'm fucking talking to you! You look like you got something to say. Don't you even look at her! You're standing there like you think that you're better than everybody else. Let me tell you something honey. Warden favoured you and you will get bad in here real quick. Finish! Hey, I'm Crystal. So cool to see a new face around here. You know especially somebody who's not afraid to stand up to Mondo. Just as long as she stays out of my way. I was thinking you know. If you need somebody for anything. I think I know that you don't like to talk much. But if you need somebody to talk to... I could be like your sister or something. Crystal, you need a big sister? She don't give a hell about you. I'm your big sister in here. You're gonna consider me? You're gonna misbehave anymore? Crystal, you misbe... Yes? Why don't you pick on someone my size? Okay, so she makes her move! I hope you don't think I'm gonna be scared just because you killed somebody. Maybe I'll make it two. Let me tell you something, I got four on you honey. And I'm not trying to bullshitting away like some justify or homicide. What do you know about me? Don't play me, I know everything about you! I see at you on the news, Solitaire. And let me ask you something, why the hell do you call yourself that anyway? Cause I don't play well with outers. Wow, wow, sweetheart. You will learn to be a team player. And right here is your first lesson on the house. Brigitte, Lina! Enough! I should have known! Perhaps we weren't properly introduced before. My name is Elsa Thorne but you can call me bitch behind my back. More than Danvers enforces the rules on the program, I enforce discipline! She believes in the strong mind, I believe in the strong first impression! You're gonna be handful. Maybe two handfuls. Your ass is in solitary for the day. Not a good way to get started here. - What about them? - They're coming too. Oh, bullshit! There will be a rematch. Don't sleep, Solitaire! Mother's blood. No! Bitch can't escape me! Rise and shine, ladies! It's a beautiful morning. The temperature is gorgeous 82 degrees. So up and at them. Everyone, in the showers! Shut the fuck up! This is gonna be fine. It's gonna heal in no time. Thank you. Good thing Solitaire is here. Could have been a lot worse. I mean she was so amazing. You should have seen her. Yeah, I wish I was there. I heard she fought them all at once? Yeah, all three of them. She totally held her own. - She was about to bash Mondo's face! - Listen, you just stay clear on Mondo, okay? I'll try. You know I'm not actually really worried about it anymore. Cause now Solitaire is here. Solitaire seems to be making quite an impression. Yeah, she kicked Mondo's ass real good. I know her little gang too. - Bearly broke a sweat. - Really? You got something for me or what? - Yeah. - Come on! Yeah, I can prescribe something for you. This is it? Sorry, it's the best I can do. Hey, you got something for me? Yeah, I got something for you. Solitaire? You know the only good thing about being pregnant in jail, is that they let you take extra food. You know, I wanted to come and tell you that I thought it was really cool what you did for Crystal today. Nobody ever stands up to Mondo like that. I wish I could but... You remind me of Steve like that, you know. Such a bad temper but really not that bad when you get to know them. I better get back before I get caught. So guess I'll see you later. Thanks. Come with me. - What? - Let's go. See how Mondo treats you? You're scared, aren't you? Yeah. I want to fight back but... Anyway now Solitaire is here, I don't think I got to worry about it anymore. Do not trust her. She's violent. Unpredictable. She could turn on you too. Why do you say that? Anyway, who's gonna protect me? I can look after you. I can make sure that Mondo and her girls leave you alone for good. But you have to be good to me too. Good to you? Now Crystal. It won't be that bad. You can ask Hotrod. She seems to really like it. - Now I have to like it too? - Oh, please don't be like that. You make it something awful. Look, who's hands would you rather have on you? Mine or Mondo's? Do what I ask and I promise Mondo will never touch you ever again. Elsa, this is not productive. We've spoken about this before. We're simply coming to an agreement. A mutually rewarding agreement. You are not taking advantage of any of this girls under my watch. Now they're here to follow a program, I want no distractions. I am taking advantage of no one. Nobody is being forced and nobody is being hurt. Isn't that right? You are not to have any more sessions with these girls. I don't want any more of them coming back damaged. Crystal! Call your guards! Nevermind, I'll do it myself. She's running across the restrictive yard. We have a prisoner in the restrictive area. All units report. We have a prisoner in the restrictive area. All units report. Yoga class will commense in 15 minutes for the green room. Please make your way down to the gym hall. I'm giving you a second chance. Please make the most of it. Despite what you might think, punishment is not one of my favourite things. Did you drug me somehow, Danvers? Mind does strange things in isolation. Especially the first time. Perhaps you've heard some rumors about the history of this place. But it would serve you to just let all that go and focus on your reality in the present. My mind doesn't play tricks on me, I know what I saw. Then do your best to avoid that womb, Solitaire. Like I said I don't believe in negative reinforcement. So help me by not earning it. Your temperature seems to be normal. Blood pressure is holding steady. I think Danvers is just being normally cautious. You are pretty good with those fists though. You get quite a reputation. I hear you gave Mondo a run for her mind. I just don't like seeing people taking advantage of. Humility is for the weak. There is strength in your blood, you shouldn't deny that. Are you my therapist now? Let's just say I think there's something very special about you. What's Danvers hiding? I wasn't aware Danvers was hiding anything. I saw blood on the walls! That blood is ancient history, it's been there forever. We're gonna take care of it as soon as possible. What happened in this place? I know just as much as you do. Get back up on the table. I'll give you vitamine injection. I'm a little freaked out about Crystal. Did you notice the way Danvers and Elsa are running around? Whispering and acting like nothing's wrong. This isn't the first time something heavy has hit this place. Yeah, I feel it too. Help! Guard help! Look at this. I have cut artery. Look at this, I'm bleeding! Hey, it's an artery! I'm fucking bleeding now, for this goddamn piece of shit! I didn't know Brigitte was such a crybaby. Don't stress her. You'll be crying next. Is this a rematch? - I wanna piece in this one too. - This is my fight! Go grow some balls. You're feeling froggy, leave. Are you all right? Stop it. What am I doing here? - The idea was for you to relax. - You shot me, you bitch! I was defending myself! - Where's Mondo? - Back in solitary. So are her girls and your friend Waco. Care to join them? I'm hoping emerging therapy will help you find peace. Peace? Peace of what? Lie back, Solitaire. Lie back and let the water surround you and calm you. Let yourself become detached from your rage. That's it. Lie back. Step outside yourself, Solitaire. Bathe. Overcome. - Who is he? - What do you mean? I saw him again. Evil. He was with my mother, he died in this room. Many men died in this room. None of them fucking exploded, that should never went down. It happened, I saw it. And I don't think he's left this place. Have you ever had a vision like this before? Any occurance of psychic ability? A little with my mother, but nothing like this. You will tell me what I need to know. - I wish I could help you. - You wish you had. Now how long is this gonna take? I can hurry, then you go right back to solitary. Don't get smart with me, doc. You know I will snap your neck like a fucking pencil and make it look like an accident! I'm sure you can. You are the strongest woman we have in here. Or that is you were until Solitaire... Slow you rule doc. We both know that she just got lucky. And if you don't stop flapping your gums, you're gonna be the next one taking a beat down. So many threats, Mondo. I think I'll have a little something to calm you down. Now you sound like the warden. She thinks she's smarter than me, smarter than everybody. And you know she thinks she's smarter than you. Well, she's definitely wrong about that. But just keep that in secret between the two of us, shall we? Yo, what the fuck is that black stuff? I already had my vitamines, I don't need any more. It's just a booster. After what happened this morning I thought maybe you could use a little something. Whatever. Just hurry up so I could get the hell out of here. Mondo? Mondo, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Mondo, can you hear me? What's happened in here? Oh, my God! She went crazy. I was treating her wounds and she flew into a rage. She killed Frank, I only tried to stop her. I'm sorry. I had to put her down. - You put her down all right. - I had to! You knew what she was like, how strong she was. I had no choice. Doctor Swann, I want you to dispose of these two bodies as descretely as possible. - Discretely? - Yes. If one of this gets out, this program is finished. First Crystal and now this. What is happening here? My work must continue and it will. Do your part, doctor Swann and leave the rest to me. You stay here. He'll need help cleaning this up. We haven't met, but we've been acquainted all of our lives. I'm sorry. The baby's kicking me good. - You want me to get you some help? - No, I'm fine. I just gotta relax. Get some damn positive energy. Guess it's the first time I heard you joke around here. Maybe Danvers' voodoo working on you. Yeah right, Danvers. - If it's anyone it's you. - Me? What do I have to do then? You remind me of somebody. You mean her? Someone took her from me. I never got to know her. You know, you are the only one in this place that doesn't seem like belonging here. I think you'd make a good mother if you could get out. What's the matter? - Emily. - I know. - I know, it's coming. - Jesus Christ. - It's not supposed to. - Hey! We need some help down here! - It's Emily, she's having a baby! - You have to help me. - Shut up! - I'm trying to sleep! Hey! I said she's having her baby right now! I said she's having a baby right now! Hey! I need help down here! Oh stop that banging! How you're doing? You're hanging in there? Come on baby, I'll be right back. You stay here and I'll go get help. I heard what happened. How are you feeling? Where's my baby? We've made arrangements for the baby. But we're no longer capable of taking care of you. For the time, I have no choice but to keep you secure. No. Please don't go. I regret to have to do this. I thought our first therapy generated some positive results. I have no choice now but to arrange for your transfer. Just when I was getting to know this place. I'm ready now. Show me! You have something that belongs to me. I don't have what you want anymore. Too late. - Too late. - Too late. You shouldn't lie to me. You know that. I can feel your heartbeat. I can feel blood running through your veins. You couldn't stop me from delivering her! Time is on my side. I found you. And I'll find her. Behind this... beauty... lies your destruction. What do you want? I need your help. They won't let me out to see my baby. Oh, you need my help. All of the sudden you need a pathetic junkie's help. Guess I can't call you Preggers anymore now, can I? I know what's your real name is. It's Emily. Do you know what my name is? - No. - No. No. You just judge me cause I have a certain relationship with a doc. And you figure that you can use me to get to your baby, isn't that right? You know I never do nothing to nobody except myself. - I certainly didn't kill anybody. - Neither did I! No, it was your loving boyfriend. I didn't know that he was gonna shoot that guy. You think whatever you want about me, but I love my child. That guy he shot was somebody's child. I'm gonna help you. You know why? Because you would never ever do it for me. And after this... You and I will both know who the better person is. - How's it coming? - It's coming just fine. It should be running pretty soon now. Pretty soon now? You were supposed to have her repaired over an hour ago. I guess that's the problem when you use cheap labour. Don't you talk that to me! Remember who's your boss here. - Of course. Denver's right? - How dare you! Come with me. It's the last time I'm gonna warn you. I thought we had understanding. I thought we had an agreement. I thought it's gonna be something... I thought this was gonna be mutually beneficial. You will learn to obey. We're gonna learn you respect me. And you're gonna learn to like it. Do you understand where I'm coming from? Elsa Thorne please report to warden's office immediately. - Elsa Thorne. - Shit! Elsa Thorne please report to warden's office immediately. Stay here. Don't dare to leave. I'll be right back. What's up doc? Not much. Hey, where did you come from? Where've you been? In a bit of rush today. Yeah, it's been kind of stressful day and I just need something to relax me. - Oh, some thing huh? - Come on, you know what I mean. And you know what I mean. Come on. - Wait. - What? - What about the baby? - He's asleep. - We can be quiet. - You will be. I'll be nice and quiet too. Baby, we'll get you too in a minute. We can talk about that later. You called. We're moving Solitaire out first thing tomorrow. She's being transferred. So we're folding, just like that. She's a wild card. There's no way of knowing what she'll do next. You know what, it's your program. By the way. Why is your hair wet? You gotta let me outta here! Danvers! Get Danvers! Let me outta here goddamn it! This had better be good. Solitaire, I am warning you! You better stop this right now! You're only making this worse for yourself. I thought you and I had an understanding! What's happening, what's wrong with her? I don't know. Well don't you think you should find out? And you call yourself security. - We gotta get out of here right now! - Calm down, Solitaire! - It's too late, we gotta go! - No one is going anywhere. - Do not make me use the teaser again. - You'll need a lot more than that. - Something's coming! - What's coming? Something evil! Solitaire, stop it! Stop it! You should listen to the warden, calm down. - What are you doing to me Swann? - I am making you stronger, Solitaire! I'll show you how strong I am! What is that stuff Swann? What have you been injecting me with? It's blood that can prolong your life. Strong enough to withstand aging, to stay off the disease! What are you talking about? Who's blood? You've seen him. You've had visions, you told Danvers. A man who died here twenty years ago, but who's blood lives on. What do you know about him? Because I saw him too. I was there. That night I collected Shadow's blood. And since that time I have dedicated my life to understanding and harnessing its true power! His blood is the life! And you've been keeping it all this time. For years it was nothing. All scientific analysis yielded nothing. But when they opened this place after 20 years I seized the opportunity to come back to the site where it all happened! And only then did his blood reveal its true power to me. But it doesn't look like you've benefit it. I would never dare to test this on myself until I found someone I thought was strong enough to survive it. That's what happened to Mondo. She didn't go crazy, you dosed her with his blood! I thought she would have the strength. It's a shame she didn't. But you do. Don't you notice how much more powerful you've become? Yeah. And I thought it was Danvers diet plan. Solitaire please, think of the possibilities! You and I are among the chosen few to attain immortality! No Solitaire! Think about this. This is the greatest chance of our lives. Emily! Emily! We gotta go now. We gotta go. Where's my baby? We need to get him! Somebody, guard, monitor room, somebody answer! - What a hell is going on here? - Just hang on the silence. Where have you been? I just found Hotrot dead in the shower room. Somebody ripped out her goddamn heart. Rise! Rise! Stop! I'll shoot! This is Rollins, they got it to block four. Fire. Shit! What the fuck! Where did you go? To hell and back. How do we stop those things? - A bullet in the head. - Or take them apart. They had no choice but to stay down. Look, we gotta get everyone out of here right now! They already have this place surrounded. You should know that for yourself. - We'll be safer if we just stay in here. - Yeah, for how long? They're not gonna wait for us to come outside! What are you saying? They're hungry, they're pissed off and they've got help. What do you mean help? We haven't seen the worst yet. You... You are back. - Do I know you? - Yes, that night I was there. I saw your true power with my own eyes. You were my executioner. Thank you. Your hands were the instruments of my destruction. Now it's your turn. I beg you, please forgive me. Enlighten me. I give my blood to those whom I choose. To those who choose to stay with me. I choose to serve you. I've kept your blood. It can restore you to your full power. Mother's blood can restore my full power! But I can help you. There's someone here who is as strong as you are. The girl. - How did you know? - I sensed her presence. Man's blood is weak! And coward's blood is weaker still. - Did you call for help? - The phones are dead. What's your plan now? I am not putting anyone else at unnecessary risk. We need to wait out the night... And then what? They'll all be gone by morning? Look Danvers, I'll lead the charge, we all gotta get out of here right now! I'm not leaving them trapped in there. You gotta go. Go! - Come on girls, come. - Hurry up. What a fuck are those things and where they come from? Get a grip I have no idea but we have got to stick together. Stick together? Seems like it's every woman for herself. Come on, get out of here! Solitaire! I'm stuck! Can't open the door! Help! - Fuck you! - Rage, come back! Hey, it's gotta be here! Get me out of here! Rage! Rage! No! Rage! Don't be foolish! - Hurry up! - Come on, girls! I tried to fight them. They're too many. It's okay. You fought them real good. All right, everyone up on the clow block. Look! We have got to stick together if we're gonna get through this. Now we'll be safe upon the clow block. - There's no way safe here. - Then what do you suggest? We don't wait for them to come to us. We break through one of the empty cell locks. - Then we have to fight them in the yard. - We have to fight them one way or another. I'm with her. - This isn't your decision to make. - News flash bitch. You don't run things around here anymore. Just a minute. There may be another way out of here. Down to the basement. - Okay, next idea. - I mean it! A passage way for stuf in case riots. It may still be open. I'm not risking everyone's life on an escape that may or may not be there. Then we'll check it out first. If it's open, we put everybody down. - And if not? - Then we're still trapped, aren't we? Wait, let me go with you. I have to find my baby. Emily, stay with Danvers. So who's this man you've been talking about? The monster who raped and murdered my mother. - I thought you killed him. - I thought so too. It's not very heroic. Killing the wrong man. I thought there was evidence. Where's this passage way you were talking about? Crystal? Is that you? Where've you been? Fuck this. Either they're dead or they got out. Neither way they are coming back for our sorry asses. No, Solitaire would never leave us behind. You know what, you can sit here and you go wait for her all night. I'm outta here. Who's with me? You want a rematch? Ah, shit! Get the fuck! Slow down. You don't get to tell me what to do. - Tough girl. - That's right. Delicious. Where is she? - Who? - The girl. The one with the power. - Fuck you! - Fuck me? I hear you. Where are you? - I'm coming! - Emily, no! No wait, it's not safe! I hear you. I'm coming! Wait, I hear you. I'm coming! Welcome. - Come on in. - Shut up. I've been waiting for you. You did feel my heartbeat. Your blood is... strong just like your mama's. I'm sorry. We haven't met. But we've been acquainted all our lives. I know you too well. Ever since I stepped foot in this place. And I know what you did to her! Really? Luisa was so clever. Mother's blood. So strong. I tried to preserve it but she escaped me before you were born. But now fate has delivered you to me. No. It's delivered you to me! Wonderful! You are strong! She would have been proud. And you're just as beautiful. Behind this beauty lies your destruction! That's what your mother told me just before she died. So I have left of her. Her blood lies in you. You want blood? Oh, who left you here? Mommy's got you. What is that? Why, you're hungry, is that it? Here. Behind this beauty lies your destruction. You're stronger than I anticipated. So it began with your mother and me. Now it's just us. Now you can doubt your strength, Cassandra. How do you know that? How do you know my name? I know more about you than you could possibly conceive. I barely knew your mother at all. She was just an appetizer. She would have never had you. She was my mother and you raped and murdered her! No you're wrong, Cassandra. I touched her. Then she became your mother. And then I murdered her. She was just a sacrifice for my immortality. But she tried to rob me of that when you were born. Can't you feel my blood boiling in your veins? You have no idea. Fate has brought us together so I can snatch it back! No. It's brought us together so I can avenge her! You talk about your mother's life. Yet you disavow the name she gave you. You call yourself Solitaire. - You wanna know why? - Yes. Because I love the sight of red on black.
