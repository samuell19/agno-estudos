WALKING MY LIFE The cancer cells are stained red. I see... Unfortunately, the cancer's already spread. I see... How much longer...? How many years do I have to live? I can't be certain. But in your case, Mr. Fujiyama... about half a year. Hello? Sorry to interrupt work. You don't usually call... Is something wrong? You said you'd call about the check-up results, but you didn't. Ah, I forgot. Everything okay? Yeah. It's just from stress. Oh, that's good to hear. Right... Late again today? Perhaps... Call if I need to make dinner. Alright. Don't smoke too much. Bye. Hello? I'm here. I'll hang up now. Okay. Welcome back. Good afternoon, Director. Director...? Hey. I received the pamphlet layouts... None seems exactly right. What'll we do? Not "what'll we do"! What will "you" do?! You don't like it, you fix it! Yes. If I always decide things, you'll all get bored! I'm sorry. Director... New employee party on the 20th, yeah? As you like. Karaoke, yeah? They'll really enjoy it. - Hagio... - Yeah? Stop that stupid "yeah"! Here's your order! Thank you. Welcome home. What...? Tofu. It's not that. Why so early? Did something happen? Nothing's happening. So, I'm home early. Let's have boiled tofu. Boiled tofu? Yes. You said you'd call about dinner. Sorry. I thought I'd eat alone, so didn't prepare. Where's Haruka? Club activities. And Shunsuke? He never comes home this early. Really? It's unusual for you to want tofu. The doctor said to eat high protein, low calorie food. I'm impressed. You did as you were told. If I do it, I do it well. When do you go next? Where? The hospital. I suppose it's next month. Make sure you go. Don't say you're busy. Alright. Okay. Doesn't Haruka have something? Something? Club event? That's the national cheerleading meet. It's in November. In November, huh? You missed it last year, try to go this time. Want some? I think I will. Dad, welcome home. I'm back. You're early. Haruka. Isn't that odd? What? I came home first, but you said "welcome home". It's odd? It's strange if you say "welcome home" and reply with "I'm back". Either way is okay. Haruka. Join me in the bath? Mom, Dad's saying weird things! I'm home. Ah, I'm tired. Oh, you're here? Hi. Why's the light off? Well... Hey, rice balls. Good night. No bath? Not now. Shunsuke. Have you grown? I doubt it. Not like I'm in Junior High. I guess so. So, how is it? University, I mean? Come on. What is it? What is what? You asked to meet, what did you want to talk about? Yes. To tell the truth... I have lung cancer. In its final stages. It's spread to other places. Surprised? I was shocked, too. I thought he must be wrong, but the doctor's an expert. I have half a year. Surgery can't help at this stage. I'll refuse life-prolonging treatment, and keep working. I don't know how long my body will last, but I'll live as before. I haven't told your mom. She's the type that will take it all on herself. I'll keep her suffering short. An instant, if possible. I didn't tell Haruka. But you're my eldest son. And what's more, a man. Please face this with me. You recall the death of your aunt in Nagoya. I don't want that. I want to truly live until I die. That's what I'll do. Stand by me during this. It's Fujiyama. You usually call first. Sorry. Are you working? Is it okay? It's okay. No beer, thanks. You have to work? No... Are you hungry? I'm fine. How was the check-up? Cancer. That's not funny. I'm not joking. Where? Lungs. Good that it's your lungs. Surgery can fix it. Seems that it's spread. I've got six months left. What's wrong? Let's check at another hospital. It's okay. It's okay! Just sit down. Maybe I'll die with you... That's old-fashioned. I guess. It's the biggest shock so far in my life. For me, too. At least try surgery. No way. Are you scared? I am scared. It's better than dying. Both scare me. Got a cold? Maybe? "B Project" is going well. Yeah... Don't work so hard. Take it easy. Sorry to be late. Director, look at this. It's great. Nice to see it complete. Great! Hagio, hand this out. Yes. I revised the estimate. Are you awake? Yes. Come in. What's up? Actually... I want you to seek treatment. Anything is fine. Sorry, I've made up my mind. Don't look like that! Bedtime. Okay. Ah. Yes? Thanks... for telling me. Cheer up. Good night. Good night. Final farewells? Yes... A chance to meet former friends. To say farewell to each in person, rather than in writing. To understand what my life has been. Searching for yourself? No... My self is right here. I have no doubts about who I am. It's hard to explain... It's rather like searching one more time for something that's been lost. Is that so? I understand. I'll respect your decision. But be aware that choosing to refuse treatment requires great resolve. Yes, I understand. No, I probably don't understand. But it's what I chose. So, please accept it. Won't be long, Won't be long, I'm not singing! Director We did it all for you... SEARCH RESULT Name: Miho Sawada (maiden name: Fukuoka) What?! You don't remember? Is that so...? I'm sorry. Not at all... Of course you don't recall. You were my first love. By the time I resolved to tell you, you were gone. Is that so? Yes... You must wonder why I brazenly tell you now, but... actually... I have cancer... They say I'll live only six more months. Therefore... I wanted to say... what I couldn't say back then. That's all I wanted. Fujiyama! I'm glad you told me. It was really good to see you. Me too. Thank you! What's going on? Why is "B Project" on hold? Coastal family units don't sell. Wait a minute! Three years of planning costs! That's the problem. You took too long, it's not profitable. It's not just my section to be blamed. Yamashiro, what do you think? Well... We're going to focus on single women in the city center. Project planning recommends that. Yes. President, that settles it. Wait a minute! The cost reduction plan... Fujiyama! Calm down. This isn't like you at all. I heard this is just a reporting session. Is that so? Yes. We'll decide at the board of director's meeting. Notice of Planned Construction January 2010 Projected Completion Miwako... Yes? Is it okay if I'm fired? No problem. Thanks to you, we raised two great kids. Alright. "Alright"? Mom! It's okay. I'm going to take a bath. I'll be in the bath. Okay. Will you get fired? Did you do something? No, not yet. "Not yet", so you will do something? Perhaps... What are you saying? Dad, you're weird lately. Weird? Different than before. Tell me what's changed. You get a girlfriend? You silly! What's that for? And you? Got a boyfriend? You changed the topic! You won't tell Mom? I won't. For sure? For sure! If I tell, will you? Tell what? If you have a boyfriend. It's a deal. I will tell. Good. I'll tell you, then. To be honest. I've never been unfaithful. Now it's your turn. It's a secret. You said you'd tell! It's a secret! Haven't had dumpling "soba"? No... Finding new things shows you're still young. "B Project" won't be put on hold. President... Huh? Let's eat. Having to put things on hold... is fatal for a realtor. However... getting the board of directors' approval depends on you. I understand. As long as no one interferes. Don't worry about the whiners. Small minds, big mouths. Right. Good, isn't it? I prefer regular noodle "soba". Preferences change with age. That's one of life's pleasures. Miho Fukuoka This one. Thank you. 2.300 yen please. From 3.000 yen. How's Kiyoshi? What? We were high school classmates. Ah, really? Unfortunately, he's out for deliveries now. He's back! Dear, your friend's here. It's been a while. You recognize me? Yeah... I was in the area... Is that so? Please, dear! Why so rude? Sorry about that. Please come inside... Thanks, I'll go now. I see. Here's your change. Thanks! Thank you! Well, take care. Yeah... Still a Hanshin Tigers fan? Until I die. You still smoke? You showed me how! Settle down. I'm glad you smoke. Nobody smokes anymore, I'm embarrassed. Butts all over the floor... You're as dirty as ever. And you are still just as fussy. Your wife is lovely. I'm surprised. Watch it! Nothing changed here. High school kids still dream of making it to baseball finals. How long has it been? It's 31 years since we last talked. 31 years! You've aged quite a bit. You mean my hair?! What was that fight about? You don't remember? Grand Funk. Right, Grand Funk Railroad. Whether the 1971 Korakuen Stadium concert in the rain was live or taped. - That's all? - Really scuffled. It was live. Electric amps in the rain? It was recorded. You didn't see it! You didn't see it either! If you forgot why we fought, why were you so hostile earlier? I was shy. Shy about what? We haven't made up yet. Yes, that's true. You were good at making lines. Better than at baseball. Shut up! You were just a substitute player. But I did like making lines. I'll tell you how. Don't think of the place you're at. You must choose your end point and focus on that. Who cares? Hey! Something happen? Yeah... Did you get laid off? Your wife left you? That was a good throw. Would've made you a regular player. I teach the juniors here. You do? Bad luck for the learners. That was a lousy one! It's you that's getting old! It didn't reach here. What happened, huh? Don't keep me waiting. Cancer. I've got five months left. My back hurts so much... I can't do it like I used to. Is there something I can do? Yes. What? If anyone at my funeral asks what we fought about, don't tell them. It seems foolish... and also, I want to leave behind one secret. It's a deal. I'll go now. We'll meet again? No... I think this will be the last time. Bye. Kiyoshi. It was taped! Bye! I'll be late! Good morning. Coffee please. You sleep too late. Just because you've started waking up early! Shut up. With thanks. Let's go to a hot spring. Hot spring? Can we? I've got some time. Great, let's go! But it's rainy season... Not in Hokkaido. What about cheerleading? I'll manage somehow. - Right, brother? - Yeah. We haven't had a family trip for years, let's go! That can wait until we become old. That's too long. Let's go! Eat quickly, you're late. Oh no! Project planning agrees that... single women in the city center represent a key market. However, this isn't to say family units aren't in demand. Considering conditions and cost, "B Project" does not deviate from our company policy, and should not be put on hold. Yamashiro! Your support. Thanks. It wasn't for you. I meant what I said. I see. Fujiyama. Huh? Is everything okay? What do you mean? Never mind. I'll prescribe painkiller and codeine. Fine. How am I doing? Regrettably, it's progressing. Mr. Fujiyama. Yes? Are you sure about refusing treatment? Yes. Do you know what a hospice is? A hospice...? Mr. Fujiyama. Mr. Takagi? How are you? It's been so long. That trouble... Why are you here? Just a check-up. We have to be careful, we're not so young. True. I have to get back to work... I won't keep you. Excuse me. How are your children? Oh, that's right! A long time ago, you showed them how to play baseball. Haven't seen them for years. They must be finishing university. You mean...? I'm divorced. Your company dropped mine, I went bankrupt and soon divorced. To tell the truth, when I saw you at the hospital, I wanted to express my bitterness. But suddenly it didn't matter. It's partly just getting older, but last year... I had a stomach cancer operation. Won't you have this? No, thank you. They said I have less than one year. There's no point in feeling bitterness towards people... Does your family know? It's too late to meet them. I'll be like an elephant. An elephant? Yeah. It's said that... when they sense their own death, they leave the herd and head for the elephant's graveyard. It's really raining. Want a taxi? I'm fine, thank you. Fujiyama... Yes? I'm glad that you don't dislike me. Well, I'm off. - Good night. - Good night. I knew! Everything! I knew everything! That we'd drive you to bankruptcy. My company's intent... I knew everything! I knew, but pretended not to know. I pretended to know nothing! I'm sorry! I knew... that you knew. He didn't have to do this... But he forgave me. He saved me from my guilt. He said final farewells instead of me. It's pitiful... My first love, my best friend... I just wanted positive contacts. Everyone's like that. There are so many people I need to apologize to... I'm tired. I'm so tired, Etsuko. FROM: Kiyoshi Sakuma Caution: FRAGILE Understanding Hospice Care: Q&A Not just a prolonged life, but true quality of life. That's the hospice way. If we guarantee a parking stall for every unit... in the underground area, it'll cost too much. Director? What's wrong? Excuse me. Sorry... Dear... Hospital? Yes. The kids? They were here, but I sent them home. Did the doctor tell you? To be honest... Dear. It's best if you just rest for now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Welcome back. I'm home. Where's Haruka? She waited, but I made her go to bed. Right. He told you? Yeah. He tells his son... Because it's man to man. But we're husband and wife! He didn't want you to worry for long. I suspected... But I was afraid to ask. Are you okay? Yes... I'll have instant noodles, too. Huh? Shunsuke... What? Thank you. Thank you so much. Take care. Are you in pain? No, I'm fine. Sleep beside me from tonight. Alright. Is it Haruka? - It is her! - On her own? - Let's go to karaoke! - Yeah, let's go! Haruka! Your boyfriend? That's not true. Come on! - Who is he? - Great! That's great! Why not get treatment? You're awake? It's been so long since I slept here. Why not? I want to truly live until I die. When I thought of dying, I couldn't help but think of how I should live. My remaining time... should be fully used. But it's too soon... I'm so sorry. Don't say that, just live. One day, one minute longer... What will I do if you aren't there? I only have two or three months to live as I choose. So I... want to live like this. I'm sorry, but let me do this. Please... write a letter. A letter? I'll write one, so you should, too. What should I write? Anything is fine. Your thoughts. Alright... Alright. It's lung cancer. Nothing can be done. I have about three months left. Please remove me from the project. Replace me with Sasaki. I think Sasaki can keep the team together. Fujiyama... Please do so! So, these are basic concepts for the four bottle designs. Continuing, the actual purchase of the goods... Hello? When can you leave? I'm almost done. And I'll quit this project. Remember when we first met here? Yes. I thought you were brazen, without manners. So why'd we get involved? You had what I lack. What do you lack? I'm just a businessman. A meek servant following orders. I bet your boss was sad. Losing a great servant. I doubt it. His attitude changed the instant he knew I was no use. That company will fail anyway! They really last. Even if their maker dies, the things that they created remain long-standing, almost forever... Finally, I sound rather profound. How stupid of you to get cancer! You seem strong, but I got involved to protect you from your weakness. But I can't follow though. Protect me... Keep on living for a long time, live and protect me. You have to protect me. Notice of Resignation I heard you'll replace me with Yamashiro instead of Sasaki. Well, I'll deal with it... Forgive my impudence, but as you started this company, I'm proud to have built this division from just two staff. It's been my entire career. Please allow this, make Sasaki my successor. That is impudent. Too impudent, Fujiyama. Sir. I must insist! When facing death, there is nothing left to fear. That's why you were level-headed, and now you're so passionate. But in the end, I won't see its completion. I didn't take the job. What? I recommended Sasaki. I agree, he's the only one that can replace you. Thank you. Follow through. You made this project. See it through till the end. Miwako. Get the tofu ready. Hey, Shunsuke. The secret Fujiyama sukiyaki recipe. This tells you everything you need to make the broth. I messed up. What's wrong? She insisted I tell her Dad's condition. You mean Haruka? She asked if she's the only one that doesn't know Dad's ill. I said he's fine, but she almost cried. She could tell, she's sensitive. I'll talk to her. In that case, let me tell her. It's better that I talk to her than Dad. I'm the eldest son. I'm hungry! Ah, it's sukiyaki! I thought something smelled good! Let's eat! Haruka... Yes? It's just great! It's not great... We all waited for you, it's Dad's retirement party. Right? Is that so? Come on! Shunsuke, get beer for Dad. Here, Dad. Two bottles enough? I'll drink, too. I had decided. At your retirement, we'd celebrate with wine from the year you started. - Must be expensive. - It's fine. We can splurge for this occasion. Thanks for everything. It's good. Worth the price... They've really grown up. Shunsuke and Haruka. Right... Even more than us. It'll be okay. What will be? Everything. Choosing a Hospice Miwako... Shunsuke... Haruka... Why did you suddenly call and drop by? I want money. I want to get our father's inheritance in cash. I calculated... and If I die, my family would still need about 14 million yen. You're in a hurry. I quit my job. Why? Lung cancer. The doctor says... that I have less than three months left. That's why I'd like my share... Don't disturb me! Why didn't you tell me? I said something awful and left. Don't be stupid. I meanly said I'd give my inheritance to his second wife. I hate to ask, but I need your help. When do you need the money? I want it transferred to Miwako after I die. Alright. Thank you. - You're leaving? - Yeah. It's been 12 years, burn incense on our parent's altar. It's okay. I visited their graves before coming. And I'm avoiding someone. Yukihiro. Take care of yourself. And you, too. Young lady, a little more to the right. A little more... Young lady, smile more. A little more... Just a bit more. That's good. That's the way. Here we go! Shunsuke! Chest out. Alright, here goes... Now! Dear! Dear! Don't give up, Dear! Please, don't give up! Dear! Dear! Don't give up, Dear! Dad! Dad! Don't die! Don't give up! Don't die! Hang in there! Dad! Hang in there! Feels good... Sorry, did I wake you? It's okay. How do you feel? Not too bad. You hit it! That's suspicious. Just go over there and eat. Suspicious... Quiet! Ouch, ouch! Put up with it! A bracket mistake. I said don't tell me, didn't I? Okay, sorry. I'm done! Correct. Of course! I always help friends with math. Shunsuke. There's an itch in the center. Here? There. It's a bit red... Hello. Are you alive? Ah... More or less. It's been a while. It has been. I entered a hospice. I see. Etsuko... Yes? I want to see you. Come and visit. I can't go. Bye. Use mine. Thanks. Thank you. Is it okay if we talk a bit? Go ahead. Lots of people won't. Everyone avoids becoming close... Here, the person you chatted with yesterday is gone today. But everyone is watching. Secretly checking to see if others will live longer than you. Forgive this talk. It's okay. Your family? My parents don't know I'm here. They'll be informed after I die. I left my fiancé after the diagnosis of stomach cancer. I'm weak. I'm afraid that if someone came to visit I'd just fall apart. Let's talk sometimes. If you don't mind talking to me. I'll borrow your lighter. Okay! It's time for morphine. Again? I can't think when I take that stuff. Yes? I'm Aoki. Come in. Excuse myself. Thanks for coming so far... I was in the area for work. Aoki is a copywriter. She looked after advertising I owe her a lot. Really? My husband owes you much... No, sorry to just drop by. Well. Please enjoy this fruit. Thank you. I'll make some tea. Please don't bother, I'll be leaving soon. There's no mineral water left. I'll go get some. Yes... - You don't have to... - Excuse me, take your time. I don't know... Sorry to just drop in. It's okay. It's a nice place. Indeed. I'm glad I can see the ocean. The scenery remains the same. It comforts me. I don't notice that I've left it all. But I am noticing that you'll leave me. Etsuko... It won't be much longer. Such a weakling. But don't worry. I'll find a good man. For sure. Yes... But you're such a fool. Men usually end these things completely. They don't have regrets and call. Is that so? Definitely. But thank you. Because you are like that, I came to love you. And I can say the same to you. Thank you. Miss Aoki? You're leaving already? Yes. Thanks for coming all the way here. My pleasure, sorry to intrude. Excuse me. Also... My husband truly does owe you so much. Please take good care of him. Aoki just left. I saw her in the lobby. I see... I should have made tea. Will you have some tea? Yes. To Miwako, I love your humming. When making breakfast or vacuuming, a song was always on your lips. I'm sure that it is a kind of good luck charm to you. Whenever there was something painful or sad, all you had to do was hum, and your heart would be at ease. Even at the hospice, I'm aware of your singing. More than any words, your songs have given me courage. "Everything's okay". "It'll work out in the end". That's how it sounded to me. "Everything's okay". "It'll work out in the end". To: Mr. Fujiyama Big brother! It's still chilled. I prepared the money. That really helps, thank you. Anything else I can do? Someone would like some of my ashes. A woman? Yeah. Miwako knows about her. I'll ask Miwako to do it. You fool. You're forgiven until now, but not for what happens next. That's just human nature. Miwako has to go on living even after you are gone. It's been 12 years since you stopped coming home. Miwako replaced you at our parents' death anniversary. Miwako did? Being truthful won't always earn forgiveness. Those that you leave behind will bear you with them forever. I'll look after the ashes. Keep it secret from Miwako. I'll bear this burden. You must also bear it until the very end. I understand. I'm counting on you. Our father said the same thing. "Look after that woman": Father was selfish. Mother knew that father had a mistress, but pitifully, she pretended not to know. I can't forgive that woman going to our sick mother's bedside... to demand that she get divorced. I was really angry, even more than you. But... "Look after that woman", was the only thing mentioned in father's last requests. Being the eldest son is really a nuisance. However... you despised our father so much, it's a pity that you're just like him. What a mess... It's unreasonable, that you will go before me. Why do I have to be present at your final requests? Big brother. I don't want to die. I've kept it inside, but I am really afraid. But... I couldn't tell that to anyone. I've been a coward since I was a kid. I am really afraid. That's okay. After all, everyone is afraid. Big brother, you put too much salt on this. Morphine enters by a tube in your chest. Push this button when the pain is severe. The morphine will increase. I understand. Can't you take out this needle? I'll become unable to talk. - That will not happen. - You'll be fine. The needle can be removed when your condition improves. You'll be able to take a walk. Is that so? You'll be fine, just fine. Wait a minute. Are you too hot? Ah, I'm fine. Here we go. The sand's hot. Shunsuke? Yes? There are so many things that I wanted to talk to you about. Go ahead. After your elementary school marathon, you had to stand in the corridor. As punishment for lagging. Really? Your mom told me. At that time, you'd gone to a weaker friend, and had run together supporting him. I was so proud when I heard that. Filled with pride. Just live as you are. Like that. Live as the person you are. Don't hold things in. Getting along is not most important. Have the courage to be disliked. I'll do that. Look after your mother and Haruka. Sure. Looks like more secret men's talk. Here. Dad! Is it cold? It feels great. Let's eat now. Let's take a look... What do you want first? Dad, what's going on?! Give us a break! You guys, quiet down. These are all Dad's favorites. Mom got up early to prepare. What do you want first? I'll do it myself. Really? Well? Good. Really good. I'm glad. Let's eat! With thanks! With thanks! Everything looks good. What's first? Wipe your hands! Later, later... Miwako. Yes? Did you write a letter? Yes. Read it to me? I'm embarrassed. Please. I want to hear it. To Yukihiro. I married you 23 years ago, and we were blessed with two kids. I have the ideal family I'd always imagined. Perhaps you feel that your job made you neglect your family. But that is not the case. When the kids were little, no matter how late you returned, I know you went to the kid's room... and kissed them on the cheek. Let's go, Father, let's go! Let's go, Father, let's go! Let's go, Father, let's go! Let's go, Father, let's go! Let's go, Father, let's go! Let's go, Father, let's go! Let's go, Father, let's go! Let's go, Father, let's go! Ready, okay! Come on, Father, stand up and yell! Go, go! Come on, Father, stand up and yell! Fight, fight! Come on, Father, stand up and yell! Win, win! Go! Fight! Win! You are the Champion! Dad! Dad... Haruka. Thank you. I'm stronger now. Good luck at the national cheerleading meet. I'll be supporting you. Mom and Dad, why did you get married? Because I was so sexy. That's not true. When a hearse drove by, she believed in the superstition and hid her thumb... that was your mother. Huh?! That's the only reason you married?! The other reasons are too embarrassing to tell kids. Ask your mother. What?! Mom, what's so embarrassing? - It's a secret. - What is it? - It's a secret. - Come on! - No way! - Tell us! - What is it? - Miwako. Read the rest, will you? Okay. Your mother will now read a love letter. Really? After 10 years of marriage, I was at a loss about returning to architecture. You told me of an assistant job at an acquaintance's design office. To tell the truth, I heard later that you'd asked the president there to give me a job. That's the way you quietly supported me Shunsuke and Haruka. Even more than a father that does something special on Sundays, the way you thought of us all the time... makes you a great father and a great husband. Dad. - Dad. - Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! - Dear. - Dad! - Dad! - Are you alright? Dad! Dear! Don't give up! Doctor! Mr. Fujiyama, can you hear me? Dear, be strong! Mr. Fujiyama, you're back in your room. Your family is all here. Please go closer and talk to him. - Dear. - Dad. You'll be fine. Dad, you're going to be okay. Dad! Can you hear me? Dad? Dad! Dad's saying something. I understand! I understand. It'll be okay, Dad. I'll really look after both Mom and Haruka. Dad. Can you hear me? I'll always be by your side. Haruka... Dear, can you hear me? While writing the letter to you, I remembered things from the past. When we first met, or went on dates, when you proposed to me... Dear. let me say one more thing. If you could live your life again... If you could live your life once again... would you propose to me? Miwako. Looking back on things, I've always been supported by you. I thought only of work, and failed as a husband and father, but you took my place instead. And you never gave up. For one so wonderful, what did I do in return? We'd have traveled, played golf, enjoyed our grandchildren's faces... I am truly sorry. I wanted to hear more of your singing... When you read this letter, probably you'll no longer be hearing my voice. But let me say one thing. If I could live my life again, I would propose to you. And if you would accept my proposal, next time I would... treasure you even more. To me, there could be no better wife than you. Take care of the kids. When an elephant senses its own death, why does it... leave its herd? Why does it travel in search of its graveyard? I could not do that. I could never just disappear in lonely solitude. I want to be seen off by those I love. Directed by: Satoshi Isaka
