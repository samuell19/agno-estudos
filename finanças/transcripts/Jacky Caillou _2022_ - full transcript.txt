"Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." Protect this man who has a wounded back. May all the wounds in him go away. That's all I ask, Lord. Jacky, you're spying on us! Sorry. Forgive me. If your lungs ache again, come back. - Yes, Mrs. Caillou. Thank you. - You're welcome. Next, please. Forgot your parents, Jacky? Couldn't we have gone tomorrow? It's today, end of story. It's not yesterday or tomorrow - it's today. Well, have you nothing to say to them? You don't want to? No? OK. Then, I'll go. I'll talk. Well... things are fine. He's a good lad. He's always been since he was little. But he's grown quite a bit. He's playful. - He's a bit lazy though. - Grandma! You suck. You didn't want to talk. Shut up. I have no real problem with him. He'll turn out alright. I'm fine. I still do my magnetic healing. Nothing to report. Right... Goodbye, the dead. Dad... Mom... Mind your ears. Ma'am... One of my sheep's depressed. It ain't moving. I see. I'll go take a look. - Go with her. - OK. - Not happy, Mr. Bert? - No. Some animals have gone. - How many? A lot? - 2 today. It's too much. There are no predators here. Anyway... How's your music going? Will you play in the bar soon? No... I don't think so. It's... My music's unusual. It's maybe too personal. People might like it. Jacky, come see! Sorry. What's the matter, Grandma? This sheep is perfectly fine. But since you're here, I'll show you. Gimme your hand. Grandma... Don't be scared. - Like this? - Yes. Look. Don't you feel it? No. The bees' time was over, over The bees' time was over, over, over, over The time of the bees and the queens I missed the time of the queens When I fell asleep Caillou, isn't your old car over, over In a hole full of stones, stones, stones? We're looking for a lady. Is she here? Are you looking for Gisèle Caillou, the healer? She's my grandma. Dad, come on, it's here. You're the healer's grandson? Classy! - What's your name? - Thomas. But everyone calls me Jacky. - Jacky Caillou? - Yes. Jacky Caillou is the healer's grandson. Hervé, my dad. I'm Elsa. So, how do things go in there? You wait in the living room. There are chairs. When you go in, there's a table on the right to leave gifts, but you don't have to. So I heard. Does she like flowers? Yes. There are lots out here. What I want to know is: how will it work with her? 'Cause we've never done this before. Dad, let's go. We'll find out. So, you're interested, Jacky? Could we heal it? No, easy does it. That's it. You're tense. Like that. Should I say something? Ask for it to be healed. Be gentle. That's it. You have no sensuality! You've never touched a girl! Go to hell, Grandma! Like that. That's it. Don't chase miracles. They don't exist. Alright? We'll start again tomorrow. Don't forget to purge yourself. Otherwise the world's misfortunes will befall you. OK. "Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our trespasses..." She went to see specialists, and nothing has helped her. Lord, Mary, make her well. She has to get well as soon as possible. I'll do whatever it takes for her to heal. I believe in you, I believe in you, Mary. I believe that she must heal as soon as possible, Lord... because she's suffering. Make her better. I beg you, Lord. She can't take it anymore. Here. Your raw liver. Thank you. I can see something's up. It's because of that girl. She's secretive. What's wrong with her? Cancer? No, idiot. Without trust, I can't heal her. She won't tell me everything. Stop! Careful... - What's up, boys? - Oh, Georges! - How are ya? - Very good! - Wanna drink? - I will... No. I will tell you my latest poem. It's a love poem. "I've loved so many times Through many tragedies Poured out my passion so often That now I owe you, woman I loved This sincere homage Thanks to you, I had such good times Even though I shed my bitterest tears When I slid my fingers over your skin When your caresses..." - Is there much more? Are you done? - Hey! "You are so present I have so much to tell you, even though we've been through it all..." Hey, what's wrong? Don't yell at him. Don't yell at him. He's my friend. Fuck, Mathieu! He's a pain, telling us stuff every night. Stop it. Elsa, this is Mathieu. Mathieu - Elsa. He's my best friend. He's a cop. How did your parents die? Car accident. What? In a car accident. Long ago? Yeah, my grandmother raised me. I was in the car with them. And your mother? She's not dead. But you know, she's still near me. I can almost touch her. Long live light! Long live light... On my way to bed. Well, you're in a fine state! On my way to the nettles. He's getting into bad ways, for sure. I'm worried about him. Worried sick. And he just walks around, carefree... Go to bed! Seriously, what else could he become? But all is well, life is wonderful. Should I leave? Should I leave? Tell me, Grandma Should I leave? Should I leave? Maybe I should do dance music. I can do it. More people would listen to it. Then, I'd go away. Nothing's keeping me here now you've gone. Well, unless... you tell me to stay. Is that stain why you're sick? Yes, it was the first symptom. Can I have a closer look? My grandma taught me before she died. I healed the bird. Maybe I can help you. It burns! It burned. Like with your grandma. Idiot! Don't forget to purge yourself... Honestly, I'm lost... Now your grandma's dead... I don't want my daughter to see a charlatan. Understand? Suddenly you have the gift? There's something I don't get. Is healing innate or can it be learned? A bit of both. If she'd taught you, you couldn't do it. If she hadn't taught me, I don't think I could, either. Listen, Caillou... you don't say yes or no, you're mysterious. I'm a rational man. At least I was. So, I need a clear answer. Can you help Elsa? Like I said: I think I can help her. Alright. But be careful. I don't know... It could be dangerous. What? It worked. It worked! Want to see? It's nearly gone. Sit down. It's insane. Elsa! You OK, buddy? Just tell me whenever you're ready. You need to see this. See what I filmed. It's gone viral. On this piece of land... are 3 adult sheep. It's a wolf, for sure. The forestry expert confirmed it. Multiple wounds... But all had the jugular cut over 10 to 15 cms. I've never seen wolf attacks, so I can't tell you if it's a pack or a lone wolf. They were just left there as if it had been interrupted. For the people, I'll be a miracle maker... She has to show you something. I'm afraid. When I heard about your grandma, I didn't want to come. Then, we went around the hospitals and the specialists. The doctors never found a thing. Then, I understood the situation, all this craziness, so we decided to come here and see. I should have been honest with your grandma. It was stupid. I was scared. Now if you can do anything for her... for my daughter... do it now. Because... we might lose her. It'll work in the end. Do you know how it all started? No, I don't really know. Well, at first, there were the trees. 3 poplars I could see from my room. Very tall ones. They swayed from left to right. I stared at them from my desk as they hypnotized me. And there was the sound. How can I put it? The sound of leaves is like a language. It was like a voice calling me. I was at my desk, revising for my exams. I spent my days, watching those trees. It seemed they were getting closer. It felt like they were pushing their branches to reach into my room. I thought, one day, they'll succeed. They'll take me away. One morning, I woke up, and the trees were gone. They were too close to the building, so they'd been cut down. And I had this stain. I'm afraid of hurting someone. Maybe I should go away. No. I need to lie down. I'm sure it's working. You OK, Loïc? I'm fine, you? Yeah. How's Mr. Bert? Not too good. Another 3 sheep were killed last night. He can't sleep. These 2 warts are growing on my hand. Your hands can do anything. Hang on. This is to stop them from falling in your bed. Take it off in 3 days. No, keep it. I don't want it. Loïc... Tell Mr. Bert it's nearly over. Tell him Mr. Caillou said not to worry. I'll settle everything. He has to believe it'll work. - Will you remember? - Yes. You must believe this wolf will soon be gone. What're you doing here? Looking for Elsa. What's up? It's that damn wolf. I'm rushed off my feet. It's a she-wolf. A she-wolf? - What? - Go on. It seems she kills only for pleasure. Those two aren't even bleeding. They were scared to death. What now? Wait here. Every night, I lose a dozen sheep. Mr. Mayor, see it my way. - OK, but even so... - Even so?! You can wait till we get a reply. Well, in that case, it's simple: we're organizing a hunt. - If you kill a wolf, you go to jail. - Of course. I'll help you, Mr. Bert, I promise. It's OK, pal. I'll figure this out. I must go. - I must leave the village. - Let's carry on. You must trust me. I limped, and the tree healed me. The sap flowed in the roots. That means it was looking over me. The child came on his own. That's also a sign. Don't give up. I won't go back. You want to save me. But I think it's too late. I'm better off like this. When I scour the countryside in that beast's body... I've never felt so alive. Hey, that's not it. That's not the problem. Listen. The forest is calling. It's me. It's OK. Are you OK? Come on. Come closer. Mr. Bert, how are you? And how are you, Jacky? Let's have a drink. Loïc, a glass of water? Caillou! Get the damn phone! Hang on in there, boy! Hello? It'll be OK, boy, it'll be OK. We're looking for volunteers for a wolf hunt. Public announcement: We're looking for volunteers for a wolf hunt. Jacky, we need to talk. You deaf? Get off me! What are you up to? You're hurting me! Get in. In! What the hell were you thinking? The wolf... it's the girl. - I don't understand. - How else can I put it? The girl's a she-wolf. Elsa. What're you talking about? Just keep still. Don't move without my permission. Let's try to fix your shit. Show us where the wolf is. Come and show us. Go on, show us. Hurry! Jacky, which way did it go? That's the house? - Which way did it go? - That way. That's vague. That way? Are you sure? OK, let's go. I saw Mr. Bert. He's at the hospital with the child. Go over there. Let's go. There it is. Give me that! I told you not to bring him. - I said he'd screw it up. - In the car! Jacky, get in my car! Put down your gun. Stop it! I told you! You can't shoot at Jacky! Elsa... Stay. Shit! Oh, boy, how are you? That's it. He healed the boy! He healed the boy!
