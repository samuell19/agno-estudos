[TYPEWRITER CLACKING] The characters aren't there yet. They're not real enough. The character you're writing about, he kills people, okay? Fine. I have no quarrel with that, but I want to know more. I want you to take me inside his head. I want to know why he does what he does. I want to know what led him to choose this path in life. Was it an accumulation of tiny, little details, or was there one moment when suddenly everything changed? [BELL RINGS] [♪♪♪] [MUMBLING, LAUGHING] Jamie... Well, how's it feel? It feels good. So... You ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Not having any second thoughts? [SCOFFS] I got a lot of second thoughts. What are you waiting for? [♪♪♪] Jamie... Good luck. Think I'm going to need it? Everybody could use some luck. [SIGHS] Luck has nothing to do with it. That's okay. [ENGINE STARTS] [INHALES DEEPLY] [SIGHS] Baby, baby, baby. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Sorry. Here. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [♪♪♪] [SIGHS SOFTLY] [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] [♪♪♪] [CAR APPROACHING] [ENGINE STARTS] Sanford? Yeah. Get in. I'm Chambliss. You're late. So how did it go? Fine. Open it up. [LATCHES CLICK] Don't worry. It's all there. It better be. You want to count it? I got the time. [♪♪♪] [DOOR THUMPS, SCRAPES] [CREAKING] [♪♪♪] [RATTLING] Hi. Jamie? You left the back door unlocked, Kiddo. Bad habit. Bad habit. [LAUGHING] Jamie, what are you..? What? You're in-- Oh, you didn't..? Break out? Still a romantic, I see. No such luck, kiddo. They let me out. Yeah, but you had...what? You had a, uh... A year and a half on your sent-- Two. They took two years off of your sentence? How did you swing that? Would you believe good behavior? Hey, what does it matter, huh? I'm here, aren't I? I brought you a present all the way from Havana. Fidel's private stock. [LAUGHS] [IN CUBAN ACCENT] If it's good enough for Fidel, it's good enough for me. [LAUGHING] So how's the writing coming? Okay, I guess. Okay, you guess? Yeah. You know how it is. Wait a minute. Wait. No. I don't know how it is. Not really. You still writing mysteries or what? Yeah. Still trying. But, you know, I sit there and try to imagine what it would be like to... Be on the other side? Yeah. And? And... I don't know. You don't want to know. Uh, you know... I miss you, man. I miss you too. [CHUCKLES] Wunderbar. Ja. Wunderbar. Ja. Danke. Auf Wiedersehen. Theresa, have Frank send a fax to the Germans. Tell them we're going ahead. Do you know anything about the international currency market, Mr. Sanford? I hear the mark is going up and the yen is on the slide. Just what do you think that means? I think that means I'm not buying a new BMW this year. Maybe a Lexus. I hear they're very good, you know. People say you're very good at what you do. People say a lot of things. They do, don't they? I have something coming up. We might be able to use a man of your talents. When? Are you in some kind of a hurry, Mr. Sanford? No. Just curious. Ah. You know what they say about curiosity? Curiosity is the gateway to knowledge. [♪♪♪] [LINE TRILLING] MAN: 764. This is Sanford. It's going down this afternoon. Well, you know what to do. Yeah. [LINE HUMS] [RECEIVER CLICKS] MAN [ON INTERCOM]: Yes? Sanford. Drive in. Hello. Mr. Sanford. Please come in. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good to see you. Welcome, Mr. Sanford. Nice place you have here. It's adequate. You can see I do a bit of hunting from time to time. Uh-huh. How about you? Not really. It gets the adrenaline flowing. There's really nothing quite like it. Mm-hm. So you ready to rock n' roll? Yeah, I just want to look at it. You want to inspect the merchandise, huh? I always do. Not bad. Not bad? They're fucking masterpieces. Yeah, you're right. They are masterpieces. Now, let me get this straight, uh... The guy I'm supposed to meet... What's his name? You don't have to go over it. I just wanna get this straight. Don't you think I trust you? You don't even know me. I know all about you. Oh, there's, um... something I'd like you to see. What's that? Listen. MAN: 764. This is Sanford. It's going down this afternoon. MAN: Well, you know what to do, SANFORD: Yeah. [♪♪♪] I'd say we have a problem. You see, I've never actually killed a Homo Sapiens before. I always wondered what it would be like... to kill a man. Get the car. Shit! [TIRES SQUEALING] [POUNDING ON DOOR] I'm coming. Coming. [GROANS] Jamie? Jamie?! Jamie?! What happened? Jamie, what happened? What happened? What happened? It's going to be okay. It's all right. I'm here. What? Gaston. What? What? Jamie? Jamie..? Jamie? Jamie? [TEARFULLY] It's okay. [♪♪♪] [SIREN WAILS] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] DEAN: I'd like to go over a few things. I already told them. My name is Dean Sutton. I'm a homicide detective. Look, I already told them everything they need to know, okay? Jamie was a friend of mine. [SCOFFS] Bullshit. [♪♪♪] [CHUCKLES] Friend... [SIGHS, SNIFFLES] Mark Gaston. Financial consultant specializing in international currency transactions. Does a lot of trading and transfers with banks in the Caribbean, Switzerland. Has a number of clients that have what we call mob connections. Now, that, in and of itself, doesn't necessarily... Just tell me what the fuck he has to do with Jamie. Look, I'm sorry about your brother. Well, sorry doesn't do a hell of lot of good now, does it? [SIGHS] Jamie was a convicted felon. Do you have any idea why he was let out of prison so early? No. He made a deal with a man named Chambliss. Works for the treasury department. He didn't tell you any of this? No. Gaston was under investigation for smuggling counterfeit currency. Nobody could get close to him. So somebody had the bright idea of recruiting your brother. So he found out about Jamie. How the fuck did he find out? What happens to Gaston now? Nothing. Nothing? You're just going to sit on your fucking ass? There's no actual proof he murdered your brother. Well, you know, don't you? We can't lay a finger on him. I thought you said you were a friend of Jamie's? I am. [SCOFFS] I was. But you aren't going to do shit. I'm sorry. Yeah, you are sorry. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Thanks, mi amigo. One moment, please. Gaston and Associates. One moment, please. Yes? Thank you. [DOOR CLOSES] Mr. Gaston's waiting for this. Hello. Hello. [OPENS GUN CHAMBER, CHAMBER CLICKS] [DOOR OPENS] GASTON: Forecasts for the third quarter are a bit down. Now, we're attributing this to the acceleration of the depreciation schedules, which isn't of any great concern. In fact, I would be highly surprised if we didn't show a little bit of a third quarter dip. Um, can I help you? I said can I help you? No. Thank you. [DOOR CLOSES] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] [GLASS SHATTERS IN DISTANCE] [CLATTERS] [GUNSHOTS] [GROANS] [TIRES SCREECHING] Oh, come on. Get up. [GROANS] See? There you go. [GROANS] It works perfect. Nothing's broken. Great. What's wrong? What are you doing? What are you doing in my car? Shut up! I got a gun. Now do what I tell you and you won't get hurt. I don't fucking believe this. You better fucking believe it! Now drive! Okay. Fuck it. What did you do-- Kill somebody? Not quite. What do you mean-- "Not quite"? It means I almost did, but somebody else beat me to it. But they don't know that, do they? [SIREN WAILING] Now let's back up. Somebody wanted Gaston dead. This guy-- Let's call him Mr. X-- Now, he doesn't want to be tied to the killing. He's looking for someone like you. [LAUGHS] Right. He's looking for me. No, really. Don't you get it? You're the perfect fall guy. Except for one slight problem. Mr. X doesn't know me. I don't know Mr. X. So how would he know that I would want--? Somebody must. Somebody must know. Okay, okay, okay. Just for the sake of argument... Yeah? Let's say that Mr. X knew that I wanted to. But even if-- Nobody would believe-- I know. Not until we find Mr. X. But once we've found him... Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. You want me...? No, not you. You and me. There's two of us here. No. Forget it. Even if I was crazy enough...to. There is no way I would let you. [SCOFFS] "Let me"? You've got fucking nerve. I'm the one who saved your ass. Remember? No. N-O. Absolutely not. Who do you think you are-- My father? [DOORS CLOSE] [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hi, there. Who the hell are you? I'm a friend of your daughter's. What the fuck are you doing in my house? Belle? Belle? [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Oh! Oh! Oh! Great family. They're not my family. Who the hell are they? How the fuck should I know? I have never seen them before. The house was empty. I just borrowed it. You what? I borrowed it. How about the car? You borrow that too? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I did. Come on. What's wrong? You tired? Come on. So you're really going to turn yourself in? Yep. Well, it's your fucking funeral. You've got such a way with words. Thank you. So, what about you? Oh, don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Oh, yeah, I'm sure there are plenty of empty houses tomorrow. As a matter of fact, there's a whole world full of them. You can catch the 167 here. It will take you downtown. Two blocks and you're at the jail. You'll look great with stripes. Yeah. Well, uh... Listen. Thanks. Sure. No problem. Good luck. You too. Bye. Bye. [OVER PHONE] District attorney Samuelson speaking. Jerry. Who's this? It's Belle Washburn. Belle, how are you? Aw... Damn it. Shit. Men. Guess what. I changed my mind. Good. Get in here. I called a friend of mine from the D.A.'s office. You know what they're saying? The bullets from your gun killed Gaston. No. That's bullshit. That's not possible. No, think about it for just one second. You left your gun in his bedroom, right? Maybe Mr. X was still there. He's watching you. You run out, he picks up the gun and pumps a couple loads into El Jerko'shead. Case closed. [SIGHS] God. They're slick, but we're slicker. Listen, let's get one thing straight. You hang around with me, you're an accessory. I make a great accessory. Of which, we've got to do something about the way you look. What? You don't like the way I look? No, I like the way you look. But so does every cop in town. Wait a minute. Wait. What exactly do you have in mind? This is where you leave your car when you go away. Don't tell me. You pick the right car and it won't be reported until... Fast learner. I knew it the minute I laid eyes on you. Yeah. I bet you did. No, really. I can spot talent like you can't believe. Did I ever tell you I worked for this agent once? No, of course, I never told you. Anyway, turns out, the guy's a real scumbag. I wouldn't fuck him, so he had me arrested for possession. Can you believe it? The jerk! [WHISPERING] Clark. Clark. Clark! What? Down. [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] That's our car. We've got 10 seconds after I get this door open. Don't people leave spare keys under the fender? Not in a car like this. No way. Shouldn't we check? Read my lips. We got 10 seconds after I get this door open. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... [WIRE SNIPS] That's cutting it kind of close. No big deal. [SCOFFS] Clark, what are you doing? They don't have those things on this type of car. [BOX CLINKS] [♪♪♪] What are you doing with that? Listen, these are not very nice people we're dealing with. So I'm just trying to even the odds a little. That's all. Bullshit. What you're trying to do is prove you're just as tough as your brother was. Listen. This has nothing to do with my brother. Got it? Okay, okay. Guns just freak me out. That's all. Okay. BELLE: Are you sure this is Gaston's building? Oh, shit. What's going on? [JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE] Keep it out front. We'll just be a few minutes. Darling, give the man something for his trouble. Thank you. You know what this is? Yes. It's fucking insane. We cannot go in there dressed like this. Oh, yeah? Watch. [BAND PLAYING JAZZY TUNE] Clark, champagne? No? Okay. Okay, what are we going to do? I don't know. You're the writer. You can think of something. BELLE: Waiter, waiter, waiter. Shh! We're not here for fun and games. Okay. What are we here for then? Okay? Did you see what he just--? Shit. Telly Savalas, over there-- That's the guy from Gaston's office. The bald guy? My compliments. BELLE: Clark. Shh! [♪♪♪] Come on. [RATTLING] Get back. All right. Business as usual. [♪♪♪] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] You found it. They did leave some for us. [LATCHES CLICK] Come on, let's go. Excuse us. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Stop! [♪♪♪] Get out of the way! [WOMEN SCREAM] Clark! Jeez, come on, come on. Jesus Christ! Get out of the car! What the hell are you doing? That's what I'm doing! You got it? Shit! [HORN BLARES] CLARK: Oh, I get it. He's out of town. We need a place to stay. What about his wife? What if she's home? She's not. He wasn't wearing a wedding ring. [CHUCKLES] Here we are. Cheers. Hmm. Now what do you suppose they're going to do with all this? What's that saying? "Find it, keep it, lose it... sorry." Something tells me these people aren't very good losers. Take a look. "Cordier's, 3:00 p.m." Could be a person, could be a place. Let me check it. Cordier... Here it is. Looks like we're going shopping.Look. "Chambliss" "285-7634." [LINE RINGING] MAN: 7634. Who is this? Treasury department. It's the treasury department. Who do you wish to speak to? Mr. Chambliss, please. He's not in. May I ask who's calling? Treasury department? [♪♪♪] They were investigating Gaston. Right? Maybe he was making a deal with them. Maybe they were in on it. What? Chambliss is the guy my brother was working for. He's the one that got Jamie out of prison. Shit. They've all got the same fucking serial number. Look. Funny money. I'm going to call Sutton. Wait, you can't call him. He's a friend of my brother's. He's a cop, Clark. Yeah? Sutton. Uh, hi, this is Clark Sanford. Where are you? I need your help. I just want to know one thing. Did you kill him? No. Okay. Okay, I'm listening. I need to find out about Chambliss. What about Chambliss? I just need to know about him, that's all. You think Chambliss killed Gaston? I don't know. I'll look into it. How do I get in touch with you? You don't. I'll call you tomorrow. Hey, don't, don't-- [♪♪♪] You know, our Mr. X must be pretty upset. Why is that? He wanted you put away. But as long as you're out running around, there's no telling what you might do. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that... While we're out there looking for him, he's out there looking for us. Hey, hey, kid, when you park the car, do you write down the plate number? Yes, sir. On the stub. Good. Let me see this. Hey! BELLE: Cop's got me spread-eagled against his car and he starts feeling me up. [SCOFFS] I turn my head around. He shoots me one of those looks-- Like "Yeah, babe, what are you going to do about it?" So I looked at my date, Chuck. CLARK: Mm-hm. BELLE: Chuck! What a prick. He's sitting there watching the whole thing. Meanwhile, the other cop is ravishing through my car and just when he's about to give up, he finds joint under my seat. So they busted me for possession. [CHUCKLES] So much for prom night. So then what happened. Then? Mm-hm. [SIGHS] Well, my parents show up at the station. Mm-hm. Dad's about having a coronary condition at this time. [CHUCKLES] Mom says, "Bail her out." Dad says, "No... Let her stay in a while." I couldn't believe it. He just sat there and smiled. "Maybe this will teach you a lesson." That's what he said. And then he left. And did it? Did it what? Did it teach you a lesson? What do you think? [LAUGHS] So, what am I supposed to do? I don't know. I do. [♪♪♪] Open it. [CLATTERING] What is that? There's a chain inside. Break it. [RATTLING CONTINUES] Honey, wake up, wake up. There's somebody here. Come on. Someone's here?Yeah. Here. Come on. Hurry. [BELLE SCREAMS] Come on, damn it! Fuck it! Duck! Son of a bitch! Now what? What? [♪♪♪] Here you go, sir. Going my way? Where did you get this heap? My name is Alexandra Cordier. May I be of any assistance? I sure hope so. A friend of mine suggested you might be able to help me. What is the name of your friend? Well, he told me that I should give you this. I'm afraid I don't understand. My name is Gardner. Ashley Gardner. This is my wife, Sophie. I'm a financial consultant. I do my work primarily in currency exchange. I'm afraid not. I'm sorry to have taken your time, Mrs. Cordier. Not at all. Good day. Good day. Mr. Gardner? [PHONE RINGING] Yeah, Sutton. Sanford here. You got anything for me? Yeah. Yeah, looks like you're on to something with Chambliss. Seems that a few people at the treasury department think that he's cutting his own deals on the side. But nobody can prove it. You know why? No. Seems that all the guys he's investigating have this funny habit of getting blown away before they can talk. Uh-huh. Just like Gaston? Yeah, like Gaston. She's here. Look, I got to go. I'll call you tonight. W-w-wait! [LINE HUMS] I thought you... What? Come on, what? You want to see what it feels like to pull that trigger. Okay, so I'm a little curious. What's wrong with that? You better get going. And don't fucking blow it. All right? Thanks for the vote of confidence. You're welcome. [♪♪♪] So do you want to tell me what we're doing here? My associate, Phillip, wants to ask you a few questions. Why can't you ask me the questions? Please Mr. Gardner. This is the way we do business. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I get it. You have a little routine down. You play nice cop. He plays nasty cop. Here's Phillip now. Phillip! Phillip! Yes, my dear? Oh, shit! [BLOW LANDS] [♪♪♪] Nice driving. Thanks, I watch a lot of TV. You okay? A red Lumina. Let me run it through the computer. It's hot. [SIREN WAILING] Oh, shit. Freeze! Nobody move. Here you go, honey. Thank you. Come with me, please. I'm a mess. We gave them a run for their money. It's not over yet. What are you talking about? OFFICER: Miss Washburn... Clark? Just gonna have to guess. Man! MAN [OVER RADIO]: Sutton, you there? Yeah, what is it? Thought you might be interested. They just picked up your boy, Clark Sanford. I'm on my way. On your feet. What's going on? Let's go. [♪♪♪] Sign here. What's going on? You're being transferred downtown. Why? I don't know. Just sign it. Where are we going now? Just get in the car. I want to see Sanford. Too late. He just left. What the hell are you talking about? Listen... Shut up. I just wanted to-- Shut up! Let me explain something to you. There's two ways to do this-- The easy way or the hard way. This is the easy way. Now let's start over. The money in the briefcase-- Where did you get it? I already told you-- Come in. Thanks. [♪♪♪] Daddy. Been a while, hasn't it? I'm telling the truth. Think it over. I'll be back. [♪♪♪] [KETTLE WHISTLING] [ENGINE STARTS] [♪♪♪] [DOOR CLOSES] Clark? [SIGHS] What happened? What happened? Are you okay? That's my dad. Where's he going? How did you get out? Chambliss tried to make me talk. He kept on acting like I was holding out on him or something. Are you all right? Look what I found. Look. Look. Chambliss is a partner in the antique company. And Gaston was the other partner. All these handcrafted antiques... Nobody ever thought to look inside. The federal government was investigating Gaston, but what they didn't realize that the guy that was conducting the investigation was Gaston's partner. How does this tie in with your brother? Chambliss needed to put pressure on Gaston. And Jamie was the way. Look at this. Look another shipment of antiques go out in the morning but they're still at the warehouse. Yeah, but... All this doesn't mean anything. Unless... [RINGS] 7634. Yes, I'd like to leave a message for Norman Chambliss. Yes, tell him Clark Sanford called, and I'd like him to meet me at the warehouse in an hour. Okay, thank you. [DIALING] Detective Sutton, please. Ah, yes, I see. Um... Do you know when he'll be back? Yes, yes. Uh... Please tell him Clark Sanford called and have him meet me at 1066 Washington Boulevard in one hour. Got it? Okay, thank you. Okay, we're set. All right, this is all rigged. What if this cop friend of yours doesn't show? Well, if he doesn't show, to paraphrase a friend-- I'd say we're fucked. I think I know that friend. Where's his fucking key? What key? The key to the gun case. Wait a minute I thought you didn't like guns. I don't. I don't get it. When I was in junior high, my dad wanted to take me on a hunting trip. Well, I didn't want to go. So we're out in this field, in some stupid duck blind. I'm freezing my ass off... And I shot him. That's why I don't like guns. That's a pretty good reason. Now where's his fucking key? Forget the key, okay? We don't have enough time. You get to the dirty parts yet? Uh, some guy called and left the message for you. He said it was urgent. I put it on your desk. [♪♪♪] [CREAKING] [SHUSHING] What? Shh. Shit, look at this. Here it is. Wait. They're going to get here soon. Come on, let's go. If we pull this off, I'll-- What? I'll clean up my act. [LAUGHS] No, I mean it. I really will. I'll be sweet and nice. And I'll even clean up my vocabulary. Get up there. Get up there. Okay, I'm going, I'm going. You be careful. Okay. [♪♪♪] Don't point that at me. Shh. God. [SIGHS] Be careful. [GASPS] [SQUELCHING] [GROANS] [THUDS] [♪♪♪] Right. Right, I'll give him the message. Yes. Okay, bye. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey buddy, I asked you a question. Where's Sutton? Who do you think you are, coming in here like this? This is an arrest warrant. See the name on it? You are gonna tell where the fuck is Sutton? What did he do? Murder. Name is Washburn, son. I'm with the district attorney's office. Do you have any idea where detective Sutton went? Well, this guy phoned. He left a message. I wrote it down. It's got to be here somewhere. Oh, shit. He's going there too. We're in trouble. We better haul ass. [♪♪♪] What the hell are you doing? You scared the shit out of me. What took you so long? I had a little problem I had to take care of. Forget the problem. We've got business to take care of. All right so, you think Chambliss is our boy, huh? No, no, no, no. I don't think. I know. Good... Good. But you still got a problem. How are you going to prove that Chambliss killed Gaston? He's coming here tonight. You're going to trick him into admitting it. You wearing a wire or what. Mm-hm. Right here. [CHUCKLES] Clark. I like it. I like it, but... I think you may be leaving out the best part. Just think about this: What if... Chambliss was acting with the full approval of his superiors? What do you mean? But Gaston's not the one they want. No... No. They know that he's got another partner. Another partner. Another partner. And this other partner-- He's the one that makes it all go. He's the one that they're really after. But there were no-- No, no buts. Gaston gets scared, you see. And he figures it's time to make a deal. But the only thing he's got to deal is-- He knows they're after his partner. But Chambliss... No, no, no! Not Chambliss! The otherpartner. The one nobody knows about. Gaston was going to spill the beans and the partner found out, got upset... [CHUCKLES] Real upset. Clark. Now, ask yourself what would you do if you were in that position? Oh, I don't fucking believe it. I really didn't have much of a choice. Well, not until you came along. But you looking for your girlfriend, don't bother. She was the, uh, little problem that I had to take care of. [♪♪♪] Belle? I hate to say it, but you fucked up, kid. Just like your big brother. So put down the gun. If you don't put down the gun, Clark.... I willblow her head off. Give me your word that you'll let her go. DEAN: Okay. You got my word. No, don't listen to him! DEAN: Come on, kid. You and I both know you're not going to pull the trigger, so put down the gun. Shut up, you fucking asshole! That's right. That's right, Clark! I'm an asshole and you're not! Ding! Time's up, boys and girls. Put down the gun. I'm sorry. No! [GUNSHOT] [♪♪♪] [SIREN WAILING] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
