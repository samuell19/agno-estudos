Good morning, sir. Well-well, Mr Norman. - How are you, Franks. Key, Harry. - Yes, sir. Mr Norman. Mr Norman. Oh .. darling. Betty .. Betty of my life. I heard you were back. I heard you checked in yesterday. On my day off too. Betty, honey. You're more beautiful than ever. - Oh. I've been sat here all morning waiting for you to phone and order breakfast. I've had breakfast. Honey. Will you tell the valet to come up with the suit I gave him last night? I'm in a hurry. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Good morning, Mr Norman. Good morning, Mr Glass. How are you? I pressed them as you like them. Soft roll. You press the uniform too? - Sure. It came down with the other. It was a mistake. I'm through with that one. [ Telephone ] Hello. Oh. Hello. Yeah. Wasn't it. Goodnight. Just like old times. Mr Norman. Are you going back into radio advertising? It's all I know anything about. - What, that same job? Running back and forth between New York and Hollywood? No. I'm not going to work for the same outfit again. I'm going to try for something really big this time. I'll know in an hour. Would you like me to run you a bath? - No thanks. I'm all bathed and shaved. You'll get what you want. - How do you know? Like you've told my son. When he was trying to get that first job. If you don't seem to need a job .. You're bound to get it. You look like you're on top of the world. The job I'm after, Mr Glass. I must convince them I don't need it. And that I won't take it if they tied me down and poured it over me. Mr Norman. I guess that's all. You'll .. call me if you need me for anything? Wait a minute, Mr Glass. No, Mr Norman. No tip. Tip me double tomorrow. Today it's on the house. - Sure? Positive. I'd be insulted. Well. Mr Norman, what did you do that for? It's neater that way. Now I have exactly fifty bucks in the world. You don't mean it? What a time to throw money away. That's just it, Mr Glass. I want to remind myself money is only money. It's a thought that helps me seem sincere about not needing a job. Anything? I want a very sincere necktie. I beg your pardon? I want something that makes me seem sincere. You know: honest, genuine, upright, trustworthy. Well .. Here is a hand painted one in four colors. At thirty-five dollars. Is that sincere enough? I think my friend, any more sincerity would be downright foolhardy. Kimberly Advertising Agency, please. 41, 42, 43, or the tower. - Mr Kimberly. Mr Kimberly himself? Last elevator, please. You want Mr Kimberly's tower. Thank you. Kimberly's tower? Yes? Oh dear, yes. She did? The first night they were out together? Yes, dear. You're so right. Go on, I'm dying to hear. Did you find out who he is? Suppose we take her out to lunch one day and get the lowdown? Alright, dear. Call me later. Bye. Yes? - Victor Norman. Have you an appointment? - I have. Mr V. Norman. You may go in. - Thank you. 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86. 87, 88, 89, 90, 91. No bad after a tough night. Glad to see you, Vic. How's your wife? I'm not married. Not the type. Now there's a law of averages for you. Ninety percent of the time I get away with that question. Now let's see. Before the war you were with JD Richie. Running the Hollywood office for a while. Before that, radio director for Pratt and Burke's in New York. What kind of job you looking for? - Any kind. So long as it pays $25,000 a year to begin. With a promise of more. Much, much more. You lay it right on the barrel here, don't you. Hey, I like your necktie. Yes. I thought you would. What? It cost me thirty-five bucks just to impress you. Why tell me that? I thought it would sound sincere. I want you to know what a sincere lad I am. Ha, you're a showman Vic, right down to your fingertips. Excuse me a minute. Hello? Check. Check. Right, Mr Evans. Yes, I .. I see your point. Right, Mr Evans. Evan Llewellyn Evans. Head of Beautee Soap. Our biggest client. Of course, Mr Evans. You're one hundred percent .. I'll jazz up the entire staff. Right, Mr Evans. Yes, sir. We'll be seeing you tomorrow. He doesn't like the commercial on Beautee Soap's number one radio show. The Figaro Picket Show. He wants a commercial that's new, novel and .. What he calls 'on the beat'. One that mentions Beautee Soap at least ten times in a single minute. I'm sorry Vic, but I think I'd better drop down and see Cooke. Our man in charge of the Evans account. Maybe we can get together another time. Sure, sure, I'll be around. Any old time. Say incidentally .. I've heard a lot about him. He must be quite a character. He gives us nearly ten million dollars' worth of business a year. Yes, he's quite a character. - But a lot of trouble? Is he really worth ten million a year to you? What do you mean? The way you talked to him on the phone, you sounded frightened. That will give you ulcers. Is it worth ten million a year to you? Hey. Maybe you wouldn't be scared of him. Maybe I wouldn't. Say, Vic. Wait a minute. I'll tell you this much. Cooke has had enough of Evans and vice-versa. Now .. You might be able to handle the job. Then again you might not. It might be a job I'd accept. Then again .. it might not. This part of your advertising agency I don't like. People work down here. I work. I work all the time. - You worry. It's not the same. Hello. Vic. Vic, darling. You mad character. I thought maybe you'd died or got married or something. Hello, Jean. - Darling, this is wonderful. What am I saying? It's heaven. I was on my way up for an audition. Jean, this is Mr Kimberly. Miss Ogilvie - Kim. Hello. - Aren't you pretty. Well, aren't you nice. I'm doing my hair differently. Vic, you playboy. You know, I think the army was good for you. Where are you singing? - El Scirocco. For a few more days. I'll drop in to see you. - Tonight? Maybe. - Don't be like that. You know you'll not pick up anything better than me between now and then. I can see you have a lot of talents, Vic. A lot of talents. But we've got to, that's all. You know how the old man is. Do the best you can, but .. Have it by noon. It started at eight this morning. He called me at eight. Cooke, you know Vic Norman? - Sure. Hi, Cooke. Why hello, Vic. Glad to see you. You look swell. Yeah, never better. How are you? It gets me down, Vic. It's getting me down. He wants a new star for the soap opera. The latest. The girl we got divorced her husband 5 years ago. He doesn't believe in divorce. Kim, I say .. - Excuse me, sir. It's 11:30. Yes, Have the broadcast piped in here. Sorry. We try a new commercial this morning. Pipe the Beautee Soap broadcast in here immediately. Evans hasn't heard this one yet. [ Radio: ] And now .. just plain Jane. Brought to you by the makers of Beautee Soap. Beautee Soap. Beautee Soap. Here's the kick: it's just as good as good-as-gold. Go to the counter and go there quick. Buy a bar of Beautee Soap. Buy a bar of Beautee Soap. Buy a bar of Beautee Soap. Buy a bar of Beautee Soap. Buy a bar, buy a bar. Buy a bar. Buy a bar, buy a bar. Buy a bar. That's right, folks. Beautee Soap not only grooms your skin. But gives it that lovelier, fresher look so necessary .. Well .. what do you think? Alright. I'd say it was alright. Vic, what do you think? I get paid for my opinions. - I know it's alright. It's good. And I know he'll hate it. He's just got it in his head that everything I do is wrong. Now take it easy, old man. You want Vic to think we run a loony-bin here? Not that we don't. But let's not scare him. What? Is Vic coming to work here? I won't say that but it's worth considering. He may be the man we've been looking for. Vic .. I like your style. If not right now, someday you will work for us. Even if I must make a job for you. I'll always be glad to talk to you about it. So long. So long, Cooke. Hey, if you'll pardon a word of advice. Why don't you take the rest of the day off. Get a massage .. get drunk. Great. Just the thing. Look here, Vic. See that? Our new testimonial campaign. Twenty-five women. Society women. Evans picked the names out of the social register and for all I know, tombstones. I must see that every one of them agrees to endorse Beautee Soap. Every one of them or he'll have our heads. He called to ask why I hadn't done anything about it yet. What do they get for it? $5,000 paid to their favorite charity. Who's this on top of your list? Mrs Frances X Dorrance. Why the star by her name? You know. Daughter of an English Lord or 'Sir' something. Widow of a General killed in the Philippines. Evans wants her particularly. 'Society' plus 'war widow'. The patriotic angle. Wait a minute, Cooke. Let's not bother Vic with private business. Nice seeing you, Vic. Come in again sometime. Yeah. Sure. You know, I like that idea. It's smart advertizing. What are you talking about? How can I even suggest it to her? I know that when they gave out her late husband's DSC .. She wouldn't even allow photographers in. I've been in this business a long time but I'm not yet so .. Insensitive I can walk right up to a lady like that and ask her. Okay, chum. Take it easy. Take it easy. I'm just as insensitive as they come. I'll ask her for you. - Do you mean it? You really will? Maybe you're a little more eager for a job than you pretend, Vic. Let's stop being coy. I might possibly take that job if you'd knocked me down and forced me. So, I'll keep my foot in the door by doing a little chore for you. How are you going to go about it? I'll carry a pipe. Women always seem to trust a man who smokes a pipe. If I had a dog, I'd try and smell a little doggy. You don't mean to say you're going over there right now .. And just barge in? - No. I'll call her first. I always give rich women at least ten minutes to get the egg off their faces. So long. Here .. here .. come here. Hello. Mrs Dorrance, I presume? I do hope you were expecting me, Mrs Dorrance. Alright. When did we meet before, Mrs Dorrance? Let's see .. Paris? Miami? The Staten Island ferry? Or perhaps we were both being presented at court? What shall we do, Mrs Dorrance? Go dancing, maybe? How would that be? We'd have a lot of fun. Ellen. Yes? Hello. Mrs Dorrance? Yes, I am. - My name is Norman. I telephoned you. Yes. The man from the Charity League. Do come in, Mr Norman. Run along, darling. I'm awfully sorry if Ellen bothered you. No, not at all. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a sport that may catch on. Thank you, Ellen. We must do it again sometime. I'm sorry everything is so disorganized. It's the maid's day out, and the nurse's day to be in bed with a cold. If you go in and wait I'll be right back. Thank you. Come on, darling. I don't know how to account for Ellen. Usually, she's too shy to speak to strangers. She still hasn't spoken to me. Please sit down, Mr Norman. Now then. How can I help the Charity League? Well .. Suppose I begin this way. I really work for Beautee Soap. Beautee Soap? That is, I work for the advertising agency that works for Beautee Soap. Do you know about advertising agencies? They're not quite the same here as in England. I'm an American citizen now, Mr Norman. But you're right. I'm afraid I don't know much about such things. Hmm. People like Beautee Soap employ us to .. Put on their radio shows and write their magazine advertisements. To shout their praises and sell their wares. To do their huckstering for them. Their what? - Huckstering. A huckster is a peddler. You know, a hawker. We're professional hucksters. But with station-wagons instead of pushcarts. Oh. It must be very interesting. Yes. Well then. I guess I'd better come to the point. Mrs Dorrance, have you ever noticed in the magazines ..? I mean, lots of times, you see pictures of people like you endorsing things. Probably, friends of yours. - You want me to endorse Beautee Soap? Five thousand dollars will be paid to your favorite charity. That's what I meant when I said I represented the Charity League. I see. Well, Mr Norman. My favorite charity .. I hope you won't be shocked. Is myself. Is your ..? You'll do it? Two growing children, you know. And General's widows aren't rich. And I thought you'd be so hard to sell. Mrs Dorrance, you have a lot to learn. - What do you mean? I mean if you'd played hard to get, I'd ask the company to offer more money. You won't do it for less than $7,500. Not a penny less. I'll say that. Maybe they come through. - Are you serious? Well 'A', it isn't my money. And 'B', I have an angle in this. If I say you were just sat here waiting to be asked. It means I didn't have much of a selling job to do. In fact. With someone as pretty and photogenic as you. I'd be willing to help if you wanted to try for $10,000. No thank you. I'm afraid I can't even accept the extra $2,500. Although I'll be glad to say you had a terrible time convincing me. Frankly, I think you're overpaying me as it is. Hello. I'm Hal. My sister would like to ask you something. Will you marry her? - Now. I'd love to. Hal, take your sister upstairs. Mr Norman is entirely too busy to marry anybody today. And Hal. Whenever you propose for your sister in the future. Say please. Ellen looks like you. You two have that wonderful quality that you get better looking as you get older. Oh dear, we're getting a long way from Beautee Soap. I think I see what you mean. Mrs Dorrance, can I fix you an appointment with our photographer? Tomorrow afternoon? They're in a hurry to get the campaign started. Tomorrow? Yes .. yes, that will be fine. I'll be free of the children by then. Why not bring the children? I'd love to see them again. You'll be there? - If you bring them. Really? Do you like them so much? I do indeed. Old Papa Norman, the child-lover. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr Norman. No, dear. I was under the impression I gave you the correct position. No, dear. Your feet are too close together. Your toes are not pointed enough. Here, watch me. Put one foot up like this and the other one a considerable distance below it. And don't press the legs together or they just bulge. Now keep the bottle up. Watch the label. Now hold it. Ah, that's perfect. Perfect. Point the toes, dear. Point the toes. Take a deep breath. Smile. Hold it. Exquisite. Yes, yes. What is it? I am Mrs Dorrance. You expected me? Ah, Beautee Soap. You're right on time, Mrs Dorrance. Beautee Soap background, please. How do you do, Madam? How do you do. - I'm Mike Michaelson. You brought your children. How nice. Thank you. - Would you come with me, please. We'll see what your costume is like. A costume for me? Of course. Something lovely. There's your background. Now then, I wonder if you'll look best in peach, cerise or black. Is .. is this for me? Well ..? Oh. They want to make me look awfully glamorous don't they. You'll look very nice. Very nice. - Thank you, but .. I've never worn one of these things. Even alone in my own bedroom. Mrs Dorrance, I'm only the photographer. I just do what I'm told. Now, if I were you I would just put this on and .. Hello, Ellen. How is my bride of the day, huh? Hello there. - Hello. Very smart. This is Miss Kennedy from Mr Evans' office. His personal advertising advisor. Miss Kennedy - Mrs Dorrance. - Hello. How do you do. - This is Michael Michaelson. Mr Norman. - Thank you, Miss Dorrance. Hello, Hal. - Hello. Mrs Dorrance. Do you think we might get to work? Do you suppose they thought they were hiring Lady Godiva? I hadn't seen these. - Don't you like them? Frankly .. Mr Evans approved them. Mr Evans doesn't have to wear them. Surprising he doesn't want to photograph Mrs Dorrance in a bubble bath. Don't be silly, Mr Norman. Beautee Soap doesn't bubble. Well. Could I wear a slip or something under it? One never does. - Certainly not. We're going to see through Mummy. You're so right, Hal. Mr Norman. - It will be alright. I think we'll photograph Mrs Dorrance wearing an evening dress. Sitting in a straight chair with a plain background. Hal standing on her right and Ellen on her left. I'd much rather. Perhaps you don't understand. Mr Evans didn't suggest this layout. He ordered it. Miss Kennedy, you've registered your objection. We've all heard it. But I represent the Kimberly Advertising Agency. The Kimberly Advertising Agency arranged this appointment. Now then .. there's only one thing left for you to do. Here's a nickel. Go phone Mr Evans. He'll hear about it soon enough. Be sure to get my name right: 'Victor Norman'. Do you have a plain, straight chair? Mr Norman, if Mr Evans felt I had anything to do .. I'll take full responsibility. - I guess you don't like your job much. Please, Mr Norman. Vic. Vic .. you've been so nice to me. I don't want to cost you your job. - Don't worry. I wouldn't let you pose in one of those things. Not you. Do you have a long, queenly, kind of gown at home? I have a long dress. - Hmm .. good. Set up a straight chair on a plain background. I'll take Mrs Dorrance to get another dress. Alright. Mrs Dorrance, please. The children. We send him for cheesecake and what does he bring back? Whistler's mother. My head. This migraine is killing me. Migraine? What about my ulcer? Morning, gentlemen. Where have you been, Vic? Where? We've been looking for an hour. I'm sorry. I was downstairs cutting a record. I have here Doc Norman's patent prescription for ailing commercials. Please sit down. What were you thinking of? - Pretty good, I say. It may be what Evans is looking for. - See that? That's what Evans is looking for .. my head. I take it you have seen the Dorrance photographs? We've seen the photos. - Dignified, don't you think? What is it? What are you trying to do? Lose me a ten-million-dollar account? Evans didn't like the pictures? - We haven't heard from him. This is the worst we ever had. I feel it in my bones. I bet it's a number three. - They have numbers? We go by how many taxis of people he needs. If one little thing goes wrong he tears into everything. Everything. Once, I was a minute late for a meeting and he got sore. He sent for three taxi-loads of people from here. Our writers had to meet with his copywriter. Our writers with his staff layout. I thought you were the boy we're looking for. I am. - Sure. And you put me in a spot like this. What am I supposed to tell him? You won't tell him anything. I'll tell him. Take me down. Introduce me as the guy who caused the trouble. What will you say? - I'll think of something. You two guys kill me. I saw troops before D-Day in Normandy and they weren't half as scared as you. If they'd been meeting Evans instead of Germans, it might have been different. Mr Kimberly, he called. Right away. He wants to see you right away. What is it? Number two, number three? Mr Kimberly .. the number four. Now Vic, you sit here. Mr Evans sits at the head of the table. - I guessed that. Vic. Whatever you do, don't disagree with him. Am I meant to look bright or does that call for a bigger salary? Just don't tell him he's wrong. Nobody ever has and I guess nobody ever will. That's right. Gentlemen, Miss Kennedy. I would like to introduce Mr Victor Norman. Vic, this is Mr Paul Evans. Mr Evans' son. Mr Allison, special assistant to Mr Evans. Mr George Rockton, chief counsel to Beautee Soap. Miss Kennedy you already know. Mr Evans. May I present Mr Victor Norman. Mr Victor. Mr Norman, you just saw me do a disgusting thing. But you'll always remember what I just did. You see Mr Norman, if nobody remembers your brand you won't sell any soap. Check? - Check. You see, Mr Foreman. You see Mr Norman, I've got my own ideas on how to sell. I believe in selling by demonstration. Any other way is all wet. See what I mean? You see, Mr Foreman, this company gives your agency .. Ten million dollars a year to spend on advertising. Do you know why? I'll tell you. I'll tell you a secret about the soap business, Mr Norman. There's absolutely no difference between soaps. Absolutely none, except for perfume and color. Soap is soap. Maybe we have a few manufacturing tricks. But the public don't give a hoot about that. The difference is in selling and advertising. We sell soap twice as fast as our nearest competitor. Why do we outsell them? Because we out-advertise them. Right? Right. - Right. We out-advertise our competitors, Mr Norman. There's something remarkable about that. This. We spend on average, three million dollars a year less than they do. We out-advertise them. And out-sell them but on less money. Does that convey a thought to you? It does to me. It means to me that we know what we are doing. Sales principles are not theory. They're proven facts. Example. Beautee Soap. Beautee Soap. Beautee Soap. Repeat until it comes out of their ears. Repeat until they say it in their sleep. Irritate them, Mr Norman. Irritate. Irritate. Irritate them. Never forget. Irritate them. Knock them dead. See what I mean? Now, sir. Here Mr Doorman, is a little idea that just happened to come to us. Just dropped down out of the blue. A mere detail we did a chat-chat about for nearly three months. A small point. And all the people in this room whose income .. Not counting mine, must aggregate a million dollars a year. Thought this was a pretty good little idea. Right on the beam. Fits all our proven theories. Check? - Check. Now you, young man, you don't like our little old idea. Why? I challenge you to give me a reason why. Because, Mr Evans. A careful examination of the layout revealed a single disturbing element. The element to which I refer, Mr Evans. Is inherently opposed to the basic qualities .. To the very essence, of Beautee Soap's appeal to the millions. And what is this disturbing element, Mr Norman? I'm sure you all know better than I that Beautee Soap sells for 7 cents. It goes into the homes of the masses. Beautee Soap was not meant for the minority of .. ladies of leisure. Now then, this picture. That loose and flossy negligee. Leg art? Is that Beautee Soap? A bored and sophisticated woman in a dubious boudoir? That disturbs me, Mr Evans. Beautee Soap is a clean product. And your advertisement isn't clean. Mister Norman. I take my hat off to you. You're right. Mr Evans. It may interest you to know that Mr Norman sat up all last night .. Working out a twist on your present commercial idea. If you'd care to hear it, we have it here on a record. Play it. Ha-ha. Love that soap. Yes, Violet . Everybody loves Beautee Soap. As personal maid to glamorous movie star Wanda Jean .. You see how effective the Beautee Soap treatment is. Do you agree, Miss Jean? Righto. My public simply demands I use Beautee Soap. Why next to the Mocambo, it's Hollywood's favorite bar. Love that soap. And not only in Hollywood. But Beautee Soap is cleaning up the whole country. West, North, South. Right, Colonel Raphael? Here in the Deep South sir, Beautee Soap .. Makes the flower of Southern womanhood lovelier than magnolia and honeysuckle. Love that soap. And up North in Yankee Vermont? Yep, love that soap. - Anything more to say? Nope. Just love that soap. And so, it's Beautee Soap everywhere. Not just in the cities, but on the farm. Correct, Barbara Hascombe? - Not much time for talking. Got to get sonny cleaned up with Beautee Soap. Sonny, hold still. You're getting it in your mouth. I know it, Ma. I just love that soap. There you have it, folks. Beautee Soap is cleaning up the country. For Beautee is, as Beautee does. So don't forget .. Ha-ha .. love that soap. Hmm. I like it. I like it, Mr Norman. Love that soap. Love that soap. They'll all be saying it. It's on the beam. Only cut the line about it being Hollywood's favorite bar .. Next to the Mocambo. Mr Norman, Beautee Soap is second best to nothing. Hollywood's favorite bar. And don't you forget it. Right? - Right. Mr Kimberly. I dare say you've an idea of absorbing Mr Norman in your organization. Yes, sir. I thought we might start him out as Mr Cooke's assistant. Salary? I thought an expense account for a while. He draws what he needs. Excellent. I see Mr Norman, you have your teeth. In our province. My felicitations, Mr Norman. You're very kind, Mr Evans. Very, very, kind. Dinner tonight. My house. Truffles and champagne. Get yourself a girl. We'll celebrate. Check. Hello? Oh, yes. Vic. It's like this, Kay. First, the boss wants me dining with him and his wife tonight at his apartment. Second. The deal is mixed up with the way you'd have looked in the transparent negligee. Yes, I .. I guess I would have looked .. Awful alright. I mean, it's not exactly the sort of thing I should wear. It's just the sort of thing you should wear. The only thing is it would have been much too good for Evans. Now, about tonight? I wish you could see the eager expression on my face right now. If you'd only come. Kimberly is on the left side. - Thank you. I am losing my earring. I wish we were going someplace else. Alone. Why? Don't you like the Kimberlys? It was a mistake, my bringing you here. Kim will talk business all the time. Aren't we a little late as it is? First, the Stork Club. I haven't been there in 4 years. Table in the corner. I might even order some wine. You're very persuasive. - Good. You know what you are, Kay? You're an honest person. You say what's on your mind. I haven't much experience with honest people and I'm not sure I like them. How can you tell what they're going to do next? Good evening. - That's what I mean. You can't trust an honest person. Down? Sorry, chum. Yes, sir? - Kimberly? Yes, sir. - I'm Victor Norman. Just a minute, sir. I'll tell Mrs Kimberly you're here. I still think we should have gone somewhere else. I think the butler does too. Good evening. Evening, Mrs Kimberly. I'm Victor Norman. How do you do. - This is Mrs Dorrance. Mrs Kimberly, Kay. - Hello. How do you do. Please come in. It's awfully nice of you to drop in like this. Do you two live near here? I live a few blocks away. Vic asked me to join him for dinner. I do hope it was alright. Oh .. oh how nice. I'm so glad. Maybe Kim didn't tell you? He did ask us. As a matter of fact he didn't mention it. He just said we were going out to dinner. But that's perfectly alright. Really, it is. Do sit down. Martinis, Conrad. Lots of times he doesn't tell me. He came home a little bit .. He was celebrating something. Are you in business with him? In a manner of speaking. I gather they had a busy day with .. Is his name 'Evans', Vic? If today was Evans' day, that explains everything. Whenever Kim sees Evans he either has to celebrate or forget. I gather today was a celebration. Yes, today we came out the winners. Just luck. I'm so glad. His life really belong to that Mr Evans and his other clients. They're all that way in the advertising business. Or most of them. Isn't Mr Norman? I .. don't think so. Are you, Vic? Don't tell Kim, but the answer is 'no'. I'm not that sincere. Whoa .. Well .. our dinner guests. Good evening. Good evening. - Kim, this is Mrs Dorrance. Whoo .. oomph .. 'Oomph'? It sounds like yogi or something. He doesn't mean any harm, Mrs Norman. No .. Mrs Dorrance. I am so sorry, Mrs Dorrance. Whenever he's had a few drinks he thinks all women are 'oomph'. All women. Anybody. Oh my, I didn't mean .. I know just what you meant. I do seem to be off on the wrong foot this evening. I guess I did it again, lover. I forgot to tell you who we have for dinner. But Vicky here, wrote the most beautiful commercial. 'Love that soap'. I'm sorry. I'm afraid now it is going to be business talk. The two subjects: business and 'oomph'. - What else is there? There's always Mah Jong. Kim, we go out to dinner you know. Sure. Where would you like to go, Vic? - Wherever you say, Kim. I thought of some quiet restaurant. Now I see how 'oomph' Mrs Dorrance is, I .. Do I have to thank you every time you say that? No, it isn't necessary. I have an idea. I know a gay, noisy place where we can get some wonderful steaks but .. Maybe Vicky-boy won't want to go there. Why not? - El Scirocco. That singer friend of yours is pretty 'oomphy' herself. A man can have too much 'oomph' in the same room. It doesn't matter to me where we go. Why not let the girls decide? Where would you like to go, Mrs Dorrance? Oh. El Scirocco by all means. My shoes and socks, Conrad. My shoes and socks. You got to wear shoes and socks at El Scirocco. Why do we talk with our eyes as we sit across the table? Why do we walk arm-in-arm whenever we are able? Feet on the ground. Ground spinning round. Please tell me why my happy heart keeps repeating .. That it's so .. No, don't tell me. Don't say you're mine. Don't tell me. It's just a lie. Why whisper words I have never known. Or speak your heart whenever we're alone. No, don't tell me. It isn't fair. For I'm foolish. I'll start to care. Why are angels singing high above? Oh don't tell me I'm. In love. She's very attractive. - Yes, she is. She's better than that. She's 'oomph'. Shush, darling. You're attracting attention. I think Kim, maybe we'd better .. Hello Vic, my honey. - Hello, Jean. What are you drinking? - Why Vic, don't you remember? Always straight Scotch, right after my number. This is Mrs Dorrance and Mrs Kimberly. Miss Ogilvie. Mr Kimberly you've met. - Yes. Hello. Straight Scotch with a water chaser. - Yes, sir. I enjoyed your song, Miss Ogilvie. I really enjoyed it very much. Thanks. You know, I close here tomorrow night. - Then what? Then I'm off to Hollywood. They're giving me a screentest. Why Hollywood? Why aren't you on the radio? Why isn't somebody as terrific as her on the radio? Just show me how. It must be great fun being a singer. It's alright. What do you do? - I ..? Nothing. - She has two fine kids. They'd keep anyone busy. You're married. That's wonderful. That's the racket to be in. Marriage and kids. You know, someday I'm going to get married and have a dozen. Please don't get married. All that oomph ought to stay in circulation. I think it's time to go home now, Kim. - I don't. Why don't you be nice to Vicky-boy? And other radio people. People who'll get you a radio spot. If Vic can do me a favor, I'm sure he will. Won't you, honey? - I'll see what I can do. They're calling me now. I have to go back and do a number with the band. I'll phone you. - When? Tomorrow. - Alright, goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight everybody. Now there's the kind of girl a man would like to get a job for. If you know what I mean. She's a great girl. And a very good friend of mine. Ah, friendship .. Nobody is anybody's friend. I haven't got any. Kim has had one too many. He has lots of fine friends. Lots of them. - Of course. Sure. That's right, lover. Name one. Name one. Why Kim, there are hundreds. - Name one. Kim, just at this moment .. I know just how you feel, Mrs Kimberly. I get the same way. While one is accustomed .. - She can't name one. Not one. You see, Vic? - I don't see what it proves. I'm telling you how to be a success in this business. I started as a dumb kid out of Princeton with maybe fifty bucks to my name. An old friend of my father's out of the goodness of his heart .. Gave me a job with his advertising agency. Old Harley Adler. Ever know him, Vic? Never knew him. He had a nice little agency, Harley Adler did. A nice little agency. All based on Beautee Soap. That's what he had. Excuse me, they're playing a foxtrot. The only thing I know how to dance. Want to hear the rest of it? You're the hostess, lover. Make them sit down. Want to hear the secret of my success? You always ask to talk of my business. Alright, Kim. What is it? What is the secret of your success? I've never told anybody. Not even my psychoanalyst. Old Harley Adler was doing fine. Until he got involved in some tax difficulty and bribed his way out of it. But somehow or other the FBI heard about it. They arrested old Harley Adler and they carried him away. Put him in a big, black jail. People have always wondered who told the FBI. Because if somebody hadn't have told the FBI .. They wouldn't have carried old Harley Adler away. And I wouldn't have had the Beautee Soap account to start a business of my own. Who could have told? Who could have told? Who could have told ..? Kay. I'm sorry. Don't be silly. It was a very .. Interesting evening. Thank you so much. We must be sure to exchange Christmas cards. I beg your pardon? You've never met people like that, have you? I'm glad I met them. They might be from Mars for all they have to do with you. That goes for me too, doesn't it. I don't understand you, Vic. Who are you? What are you? It's very simple. I came from the middle-west, a town called Ford Madison. I went back once to bury my mother. I have no roots, no past, no future. That goes for almost all the people in my world. I say you have a great deal of a future. - Sure. A series of nightclubs. Like the one we've just left. Maybe someday, if I'm very lucky, I'll have a life like Kimberly. Even the house in Connecticut, I'll never have time to visit. Knowing you, you'll find time. You're not like Kimberly. No, I'm not. We're almost there. Driver, it's just on the right. Past that lamppost. Vic, thanks for everything. A fascinating evening. That testimonial. The negligee business. Everything. No. Please, please don't get out. Kay. Get back in the cab. Get in, Kay. Driver. Go to the corner of 54th and 2nd Avenue. What's there? A garage where they'll rent me a car. Where are we going? I don't know. Out of the city. Have you ever seen dawn from a beach? No. We'll go out on Long Island. Jones Beach. Somewhere. Yes, Vic. You know, it's funny. Every time I get all set to give you a big sales talk. You've already made up your mind to give in. That testimonial. Dinner tonight. - Yes. Why? I don't know. I really don't. You frighten me a little, but .. It's funny that you of all people, would think to go for a drive in the country. Kay .. whatever there is between us. It has nothing to do with the advertising business or New York. Isn't that true? - Yes. Vic, I want you to understand something. It's just this. I'm not an unhappy woman. I like my life, my home and my children. I'm not lonely. It's the same with me. I don't want anything from you. Except you. Vic. Hmm? You know, when I first met you. I wasn't sure I even liked you. That seems so long ago. I didn't know life could be like this. I feel ten years old. I wish I had known you when you were ten. I was always too tall. As a young girl I was taller than most of the boys. So I pretended to be critical of them. I must have been hateful. I know I was hateful. I was told. I was the biggest smart-aleck to ever whistle in front of a poolroom. Darling, don't run yourself down. Alright. Kay, I was right wasn't I? About coming out here? You are too. There's too many things in the way in a town. Yes. Kay. I know a pleasant little inn. Up on the Connecticut coast near Clayport. What? It's called The Blue Penguin Inn. Vic .. I like you. I find you very .. Well, I like you. But if you think that means I'd go off to a hotel with you .. Why .. it's just out of the question. What? We must be talking about different things. You didn't think that was a proposition, did you? Yes .. yes, I did. Look, honey. You got me all wrong. Oh look. Look, here's my room over here. Then way over there on the other side of the hotel, that's your room. I mean we might be on a boat or a train or something. That wouldn't worry you, would it? No. - Well then. Oh look honey, we'd have fun. Do you like to sail? Yes. Very much. They have three of four of the neatest, whitest little cat-boats you ever saw. We'll have them put us up in a lodge, get a boat, and hove for the open sound. We'll lie on the beach, go fishing. Dine on the terrace by moonlight. You know it. We can watch the dawn come up on the beach again. That's for us. That's for us, isn't it, Kay? Yes Vic, I guess that's for us. Look. The inn is only seven minutes from Clayport Station by taxi. You ask for me at the desk. But why say that now? Are you leaving me to walk home? No. But I'm not going to mention it again. It's five o'clock on a Saturday morning. I'm leaving right after lunch. There's a later train that gets to Clayport at four. You? You'll come or you'll not come. I'll not phone you. I'm not going to huckster you into coming out there. But all day long, I'll be using a little huckster telepathy. I'll be saying to myself. Kay .. please come to The Blue Penguin Inn. I don't think I'm going to be much use to the Kimberly Advertising Agency. My mind won't be on soap. Get me The Blue Penguin Inn, Clayport, Connecticut. That's right, Blue Penguin Inn. Oh Mr Norman, it's 10:31. I'm awfully sorry. What's so upsetting about 10:31? Mr Cooke said that while he's away you were to handle all his business. And 10:30 is 'Wife In Name Only'. By actual survey. More doctors use Beautee Soap on their babies than any other brand. Want to learn how to spell? Well. B. E. A. U. T. double E. B. E. A. U. T. double E. B. E. A. U. T. E. E.. Spells: Beautee Soap. And now: Wife In Name Only. The story of a man's disaster and a brave woman's shining hour. Wife In Name Only is brought to you by the makers of Beautee Soap. Yesterday we left .. Oh Mr Norman, you'd better listen today. This is the day the hero loses his leg. Miss Hammer. Take a memorandum. Mr Kimberly. Dear Kim. For four years I haven't listened to the radio much. Paragraph. Kim. In that time, it's gotten worse. If possible .. more irritating. More commercials per minute. More spelling of words as if no-one in the audience got past first grade. Paragraph. I know how tough Evans is and .. Some of the other sponsors. But I think we make a mistake in letting them have their own way. We're paid to advise them. Why can't we advise them .. That people are grateful for what free entertainment they get on the air. Grateful enough to buy the product that provides good shows. But. They have some rights, Kim. It is their homes we go into. They're not grateful to people who get a foot in the door .. By pretending to offer them music and drama .. Then take too much time in corny sales talk. Paragraph. I want to go on record as saying I think radio must turn over a new leaf. We've pushed and badgered the listeners. We've sung to them and screamed at them. We've insulted them, cheated them and angered them. Turned their homes into a combination grocery store .. Crap game and Midway. Kim. Someday, 50 million people are going to reach out and turn off their radios. Snap. Just like that. And that's the end of the gravy. For you and me .. And Evans. Sign it: 'Love and kisses. Vic'. Mr Norman. Sir. What's the matter? Think I'm wrong? I wouldn't say. Do you ever listen to the radio? Yes, sir. - And? I'd get back at it. How? It may sound silly, but .. I make it a point of honor. A point of honor never to buy anything that's advertised that way. Even Beautee Soap? Particularly Beautee Soap. Good for you, Miss Hammer. Good for you. Hello? Oh hello. Blue Penguin Inn? Is Mrs Michaels there? Mrs Michaels, the owner. She's not here anymore. My name is Blake. I'm the new owner. What is it you want? I always used to have the same rooms in the back of the second floor. Number 4. And then number 37. Way over on the other side. Yeah. I'd like them for the weekend. Yes, it will cost you 20 dollars a night for them two layouts. Yeah. How do I know you'll come? People call up, reserve rooms .. Then they have a fight or something and I'm left holding the bag. I'll be there no later than three. Yes. This afternoon. Now, sir. About the new testimonial campaign. Right now, I go away for the weekend. - Now? If anything comes up, I'll call you at The Blue Penguin Inn. You do and I cut off your ears. As far as you know you never heard of The Blue Penguin Inn. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I never heard of The Blue Penguin Inn. Clayport 42499. Bye, Miss Hammer. Goodbye, Mr Norman. Have a nice weekend. Wherever you're going. Four years since you've been here, huh? A long time. I knew I hadn't seen you with the regular weekend crowd. Alright, so we don't keep it so good. How about sending up a boy with a new chair? Mister, we got one boy and he keeps busy. Alright. Let's have a look at 37. See if it's any better. Room 37 is rented. Couldn't hold it for you. But I got this one for you. Six. It's nicer. Here you are. How is this one? I asked you for 4 and 37. Why didn't you save them for me? What are you, a numerologist? What difference does it make? This is the best room we got. These connect right through that door. Want me to open it? No. No. Alright. Maybe if you ask real nice the folks in 37 will change with you. If .. if it matters to you. No, no. It's alright. Here. Here's five dollars. How about some flowers for the rooms? Sure. Plenty in the garden. All you must do is pick them. The Blue Penguin Inn, please. Did you say The Blue Penguin Inn? Yes, do you know where it is? - Sure. I know where it is. It's out on the point. It's none of my business but maybe you're one of the old crowd. Did you used to go there when Mrs Michaels ran it? No. Okay. So, I shut my mouth and I take you to The Blue Penguin Inn. Hey, lady. Look. Over there. That's The Blue Penguin Inn. It looks charming. Yeah .. yeah. Hello. Here is the bellboy. Hasn't anyone asked for me? A Mrs Dorrance? Nope. Nobody come in yet. Alright. Thank you. Hey-hey, don't bang it so hard. Let him play, let him play. It's his funeral, ain't it. Hey look. Ten, twelve .. Fifteen. Excuse me. - Twenty-one thousand. How about it? I still say you hadn't ought to bang it so hard. You'll wear it out. Alright. Me now, huh. - Just a minute, just a minute. Yeah? Is there something I can do for you? - I'm looking for a Mr Norman. You are Mrs Dorrance? Yes. Right this way, please. If you need anything, call. Oh .. This here connects with room 4. You want me to unlock it? Room 4? Yeah. Mr Norman's room. Oh. I see. Thank you. Hey. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Hello? Mr Norman, I'm so sorry but they made me. They said they'd fire me if I didn't call you. Mr Kimberly himself phoned. Why did they put you to the torture? It's something about Mr Evans. It's something critical. There's to be a big meeting about it in Mr Evans' office. Tomorrow morning at 11. Tomorrow is Sunday. Ah well. Alright. They'll miss me in the choir, but I'll be there. Goodbye. You sure cut things thin. 11 o'clock means 11 o'clock. I hoped to go over some things with you. - What? First thing .. The last time I saw you neglected to answer Evans' rhetorical questions. I mean those 'rights' and 'checks'. I know it seems childish, but he likes to have them answered. Anyway, it doesn't cost anything. Incidentally, Vic. I'm sorry about the way I behaved the other night. Forget it. In front of Mrs Dorrance and all. She's quite a lady, Vic. Who? - Mrs Dorrance. Oh .. her. Now, about today's crisis. The old man heard the comedian Buddy Hare do a guest appearance. He was on a program which originated in Hollywood. Do you know him? Sure. An ex-burlesque comedian. He does comedy bits and B movies. But the old man is nuts about him. He talks about writing a new show for him. Yeah, I see .. you want a rough estimate of our chances? Go ahead. - Well. Get the biggest Hollywood stars you can to support him. Buy the most expensive time available on a big network. Hire America's top-name band, get the best writers. And you probably have a flop. - Fine, fine. If we refuse to do the job, Evans will get another agency. If we do the job and flunk, he'll hold us responsible and get another agency. Happy Sabbath, friend. Here is Mr Evans. Sit. Due to the fact that nobody but me does any talent scouting for this company. I'm forced to work on Sunday. We'll let that pass at this moment. I think Buddy Hare is great. A sort-of Bob Hope and Jack Benny combined in one. Check? Check. - Check. Mr Norman. You'd better make him pretty good. Well, he is. It seems to me we should give the compass a whirl. And see if this chap Buddy Hare is headed in our direction. I don't want you fellows to miss the last bus. Let's not be like straws in the wind. See what I mean? You're in at the beginning of this, Mr Norman. I shall expect you to carry the ball right down the field for a touchdown. It's your baby now. Well sir, I don't mean to forget that you thought of using Hare. I wouldn't want any credit I didn't deserve. Let's get this clear, Mr Norman. You fellows at the agency are just as enthusiastic about him as I am. Right? Right. I therefore consider that you, representing the agency .. Recommend him just as much as I do. Check? Check. However, Mr Norman is new here. I'd like to talk to him alone for a few minutes. Mr Buddy Hare. While you and Kimberly were enjoying your holiday yesterday. I had my personal staff gather a little information. It seems his agent is a Mr David Lash from Hollywood. I know Dave. - Do you? Did you know Mr Lash was in New York? No. I took the trouble to discover that. Mr Norman, it has been my experience. That somehow or other, whenever I want a man like Buddy Hare the price goes up. I don't like that. I understand. Mr David Lash has reservations to go back to Hollywood .. Today on the Centurion Chief. I'll be aboard and set the deal before he hears you want Buddy Hare. Excellent. Now, one other point of business. Last night a change in the commercial was not teletyped to the coast. I'm told that the teletypist in your office was at fault. Fire her. She's a nice girl. Doesn't make many mistakes. I can't fire her just for that. What's her name? I don't think I'll tell you, Mr Evans. No doubt Mr Norman, you have your good reasons. For treating me in this cavalier fashion. You've only a few hours in which to catch your train. I only say that if you want a permanent job with me. You'd better come back from Hollywood .. With Buddy Hare and a very funny radio show. Very funny. Very funny. Driver .. we've got a few minutes before train time. Let's go over toward Sutton Place. 22 Barton Lane. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir? - Mr Norman to see Mrs Dorrance. I'll call her. - It's important. I haven't much time. Good afternoon, Vic. You would have a gardener. It's a very small garden. Does that make it any better? I don't know why I bother to see you at all. Except I'm not used to being stood up. It gets me sore. Very sore. I'm sorry. Cigarette? What gets me is, you didn't trust me. You didn't trust me enough to come and see for yourself it was on the level. Was it on the level, Vic? No .. no, it wasn't. Rooms 4 and 6. Connecting door. You didn't even bother with appearances, did you. It was all pretty obvious. You may not believe it, but I didn't plan it that way. I admit that once it had happened, I .. I figured it might be convenient. You'll say anything to win your point, won't you. Make any promise. That's the kind of a guy I am. I haven't kidded you about that. I didn't believe you. I thought you were more than that. Now you know. - Now I know. It's like I told you once before. We must be sure and exchange Christmas cards. We're just different kinds of people. That's all. I can't change, Vic. - Neither can I. If we forgot this, it would just be a little while .. Until I invite you to a Blue Penguin Inn again someplace. And I'd do the same thing I did yesterday. I'm going to Hollywood. I'm on my way to the train now. Oh. For how long? A week or two. Have a nice trip, Vic. Goodbye, Kay. He's my agent and he should know. He said: 'A girl must have at least one mink coat or she gets no respect in Hollywood'. So I took the coat. Jean. I don't believe it. Vic. Vic, baby. Hello, honey. I thought you were already out there. - I'm glad I'm not. So am I. Jean, you look good. Awful good. Have you gotten prettier since I last saw you? I don't know. Does it seem that way to you? Luscious-er and luscious-er. Oh that's good, huh? - That's very good. How did you find me? Going through the cars shopping to see what you can find? Believe it or not I was looking for a man. Dave Lash. The agent. He's up in the Club Car. At least he was a few minutes ago. Club Car? - Club Car. Wait a minute. I see him down there. Just one thing. If there's a break in the conversation mention Buddy Hare. Mention him good or mention him bad? Bad. You hate him as bad as if he were another singer. I get it. Hello Dave. Hi, Vic. Jean Ogilvie. Sit down, won't you. You two know my new assistant. Freddy Callahan. How do you do. - Something to drink? It seems like we always meet on planes or trains, Dave. Yeah. I haven't seen you since before you went into the army. Glad to see you back. There's a smart operator, Freddy. I'm teaching Freddy the business. So far all he taught me is how to lose to him at gin rummy. What's cooking, Vic? Why are you on the way to the coast? The scenery. Take a look. Isn't the Hudson beautiful? Yeah, lovely. Lovely isn't it. That's typical .. of all of us. What's American to us? A blank space between New York and Hollywood where people buy soap. That Freddy, is lesson number one. When a guy like Vic won't tell an agent why he's on his way to the coast. It means he intends to buy some talent. And he's afraid we'll raise the price on him. Right, Vic? You're the teacher. Whoever you buy, best to buy from us. - Why? We handle everybody. Everybody good. The boy is right. You know what? People are beginning to say I'm a monopoly. Hmm. You even handle me. Since when, Jean? - A couple of months ago. Your office is getting a screentest for me. There you are, Vic. Nothing but the best. That's Lash Incorporated. Don't give me that. You'll handle anybody. I hear you even handle Buddy Hare. That's right. What are we doing with him? - Trying to get him a radio show. Boy, this is where I turn in my radio for a vacuum cleaner. No Jean, I think you're too hard on him. Buddy isn't that bad. Not nearly that bad. Between us, she's right. We should get rid of the guy. We got him work since he's been ours? One guest spot. - That's not enough. When we get him a good job and he eats regular. Then we'll drop him. Not until. - Jean, let's go eat in the diner. Wait a minute. You haven't said who you're buying from. So far you've only mentioned Buddy Hare. I'm not buying him just to get Dave off the hook. We'll see you around. - Goodbye. See you later. Dave. You've never seen me sell, have you? - No, I haven't. Before I got to the back of a desk I used to be pretty good. I know that. That Vic is a smart boy. And Buddy Hare is a lemon. But I'll bet you five bucks I sell Buddy Hare to Vic. I'll take that bet. - Sucker. Mr David Lash, David Lash. Telegram for Mr David Lash. Here. Mr Lash? No. But I travel with him. I'll take it for him. Sign there, sir. You wouldn't want to take one for a Mr Valentine too, would you, sir? No, I'm afraid not. Thank you, sir. You know, this brings up an interesting question of comparative morals. To deliver this or not? You mean someone might be telegraphing him that you really want Buddy Hare? Exactly. You know, when I was a little girl in Brooklyn. We had a party-line phone. It seems a racehorse named Honey Lamb paid nine dollars for two. Thanks, Jean. - I enjoyed it. You could be a lot of help to a girl like me, couldn't you. In what way? In a business way, naturally. Want a secretary, Mr Norman? How's your shorthand? - Some people like it. I'll bet you were a tough little girl. I still am, for the wrong guy. And for the right guy? For the right guy. For the right guy Vic, I'm not so tough. You know. I never liked train trips before, but .. This one is going to be just dandy. Isn't it? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You're .. you're trying awfully hard to sell yourself on me, aren't you, Vic. What are you talking about? - I know you. I know you like a book, honey. You are on the rebound from that Mrs Dorrance? I haven't got anybody on my mind but you. Maybe you'll convince me of that. That's all I ask, Vic. Just make me believe that and everything else will be just dandy. America's first hucksters. Mister, you like to buy Indian suit? Never wear them. - No. Children's suit. Your Missy not got children? Want to make something of it? Mister. Maybe you know some children? Little boy, little girl children. No, no. I guess not. Yes. Come to think of it, mister does know a little girl and a little boy. I'd almost forgotten about Mister and his love for children. Special price. Ten dollars with full feathers. Come on, honey. Let's take a walk. - No. I'll go buy some magazines. I'd hate to come between two kids and their Indian suits. All aboard! Three. You got me with ten. That's the game. I think I'll go to bed. I must be fresh when I arrive in the morning. Yes. One more game and I throw you all out. Vic, I wish you'd give more thought to Buddy Hare. Then I'll drop the subject. Dave, I told you once. I doubt Buddy Hare has a chance of the big time. Anybody can put on a good show with a good comedian. Why don't you do it the hard way? No. I'm an 'easy-way' boy. I'd make my living lying down if I could. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give him to you at his bottom salary. Put him in a cheap show with good writing. Why don't you try it? - Dave, I'll tell you. You convince me. I'll buy Buddy Hare. You'll what? - If you write me an option letter. We write it ourselves. No lawyers to complicate things. Anything you say. Deal? - It's a deal. Well, kid. - I don't know how you did it. I'm going to frame this. It proves my hand hasn't lost its skill. I sold the biggest lemon in our stable. I sold Buddy Hare to a smart guy like Vic Norman. How's that for salesmanship? - It's fine. Just fine. Only one thing is .. - What? Can I tell him now, Vic? He's bound to hear in the morning. That lemon of yours. That's the man Vic was sent out here to buy. For Evan Llewellyn Evans. You're a smart businessman, Vic. You're a good sport. - Freddy, here's your 5 dollars back. And there's mine. Because I didn't sell anything. I was had. You can keep a secret, can't you? - Sure. You do and I've an idea you get a rise in salary. Hey, I'm beginning to like this business. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Who is it? - Freddy. Freddy Callahan. I got Buddy Hare with me. Morning Vic, old man. Here he is. Buddy Hare. Hiya, chum. Just call me Buddy. Hiya. Most folks call me Vic. You can call me Victor. Oh the boy is sharp and fast. Buddy's excited about the show. He has some ideas for you. Really. Yes. Material to lay them in the aisles. It will fracture them. Don't worry about a thing. Not a thing. Now, I worry about getting cleaned up. If you just .. [ Buzzer ] Need a couple of hot writers? Herman and Gaver. Scripts made while you wait. How's Norman, the white hope of radio and .. The fair-haired man of American go. George, you've collaborated too long. You finish each other's sentences. You know George, I think .. - He has something there. So do I. Wait a minute, I'm the comic around here. I guess you know Buddy Hare. - Yeah. We know him. Hey, what are you doing here, Buddy? - He's your comedian. Swell. Buddy. Your writers. Writers? Who needs them? Look Vic, you .. You guys start thinking up a character for Buddy to play. I'll finish shaving. That's okay by me. I can work any place. And he wants a character. - He's got one. Now, Vicky. Forget about them writers. I've forgot more jokes than those guys ever knew. Hey listen, what kind a program are we going to give this character Evans, huh? What's the matter? My cigar bother you? No. I wouldn't miss a day without it. Swell. Any kind of program you want I can give you. Without no help from nobody. I ain't one of them baggy-pants slapshot comics. Know what I mean? I work strictly class. Everyday clothes, like what I have on. See what I mean? I see what you mean. A man of distinction. You've got it. Class with a capital 'K'. Whatever kind of a program you want, I got it .. hey. You want a hotel routine? I got a swell one. This one is murder. I live in a swell hotel. I got a 2-dollar room with hot and cold running chambermaids. Rooms are so small .. You must go in the hall to change your mind. Yeah. The mice walk around hunchbacked. Then the dining room. The dining room ceiling is so low .. All they can serve is flounder. Alright. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Here's one I made up out of my own mind. He has a mind? You say to me .. - Hold it. Where did you dig up this crock of corn? I've been around. Round the burlesque houses? I was sort-of an Emcee. An Emcee in a burlesque house? Merchandiser of candy. I see .. a candy butcher. Maybe we can work out something where you do sort-of a gag commercial. Kid with the announcer. What sort of spiel did you give? Well .. The acoustics in here ain't so hot but .. It used to go something like this. I used to walk out on the stage and I'd say: Alright, before the show starts, I've an announcement for the patrons here. Those of you who are regular patrons of the Getty Theater. Are well acquainted with our fine selection of candy. Now I represent the Beautiful Sky Candy Company. Makers of those delicious chocolate-covered California fruits. I .. I guess I'll be gone. Yeah. You have a chance to win. A genuine water watch of Warner Massachusetts. I heard what you said, young man. You said this was not a genuine water watch of Warner Massachusetts. To be sure, it's not a 100-dollar watch. It's not a 50-dollar watch. But it is .. A genuine 10-dollar water watch of Warner Massachusetts. My confederates .. My confederates and myself will pass through the audience. Our one purpose is for the program to sell soap. See what I mean? Soap. Hey, I got it. It came to me like a flash. Get a load of this. Now. I walk out onto the stage like this, see. I slip. The announcer comes out, holds the microphone over my face. I say .. 'Hiya folks'. 'You got to fall for the Beautee Soap'. No. No? I think I have it. I know what to do with him. We know what to do. First, take some strychnine, add some cyanide .. Boys, it's serious. We must work with the guy and get something out of him. I got it. I got it. The 'painter' routine. I go to the door like this, see. Good. I am painting the door with black paint. You are furious. - Right. You say to me: go. And never darken my door again. Great, huh? - Great. Only do it. Never darken my doorstep again. I like it. I like it. Never darken my doorstep again .. Sorry, Buddy. But I want to talk to the boys for a while. Would you like a peephole routine? 'Of the peephole, by the peephole, for the peephole'. I'll call you tomorrow. Now this is it. We make this dope a sideshow barker, the thing he is. A carnival, circus kind of a guy. Yeah. That he could play. - Not bad. Might be alright. [ Buzzer ] Oh no. Not again. Hey, now .. I beg your pardon. Yes? I'm from the office, Mr Norman. Come in. - Thank you. Sit down. Hello. - Hi, Gloria. I tried phoning you, but the hotel operator said she couldn't ring you. Yeah. I hate being disturbed in the morning. An urgent message came by Teletype from Mr Kimberly in New York. 'To Mr Norman from Mr Kimberly'. 'Evans wants to know what kind of a show you plan for Buddy Hare'. He says shoot him general descriptions so we can chat-chat about it here. 'Let me have answer immediately'. Here is the answer. Ready? Tell him it's to go chat-chat in the lake. I make this audition record. Not him. Check. Sign it: 'Vic'. Are you really so sure of yourself? I don't know. I try to act like I am. Thank you, Mr Norman. Goodbye, boys. - Goodbye, Gloria. Goodbye, Mr Norman. Goodbye. How are you fixed for dates out here? Okay, I have a girl. - You mean, you got one already? Yeah, she's cooking me dinner tonight. Now listen .. The way I see this show is a normal gag comedy format with a band for support. The main thing is to get new, fresh material for Buddy. Now, in making him into a sideshow barker. We could .. [ Radio: ] Have you provided for your loved one? Remember, sorrow comes when you least expect it. At Meadow Mill Mortuary there are beautiful shady plots. Overlooking serenely peaceful Fairwood. Restful, refined, dignified surroundings for ever. Want to learn how to spell? Well. B.E.A.U.T.E.E - B.E.A.U.T.E.E. B.E.A.U.T.E.E spells: Beautee Soap. Oh boy, Wham! King of the breakfast foods. Hello. Hello. You're just what a guy needs, Jean. Am I, Vic? You're an awful pretty girl. You really mean it, don't you. Oh I'm so glad, Vic. I thought I'd lost you to that Mrs .. whatever her name is. Hey, come on. You have to help me with dinner. The cocktails are in the icebox. You've been here a whole day and no suntan yet. What's the matter? Been standing over a hot script. Working with the writers. Is the show going to be good? - It might. It just might. We can use a singer. - Hey. Jean, if that screentest of yours doesn't work out .. Will you promise to sing the way I tell you? Vic, that would be wonderful. Yes. But will you sing the way I tell you? That depends on what you tell me. Evan Llewellyn Evans is a little deaf. He likes people who sing loud. Loud and on the beat. Over there, da-da-da. He likes the kind of singers his father liked. But Vic. That's old-fashioned. Modern singing is soft, not loud. And off the beat. That's what the public want. Unfortunately, what the public wants has nothing to do with radio. It's what the sponsor wants that counts. You know I'd be a big fool not to take the advice of a hip character like you. Hmm. Vic. Isn't it nice we're both in the same business? It makes everything so much cosier, don't you think so? Yes, Jean. Everything as cozy as it can be. Hey, Ogilvie. Come here. - In a minute. First, I want to get you some after-dinner brandy. I should have brought my house slippers. You know, I like doing things for you, Vic. I like having you around the house. I'm what you might call a 'Vic Norman' kind of a gal. You know, I think you are at that. As for me, Jean honey? Whoever's apartment this is must be crazy for penguins. What's the matter? Are you allergic to them or something? You might put it that way. What is it, honey? Oh nothing, Jean. Nothing at all. Where were we? What witty thing was I trying to say? Oh yes: Jean. - It's her, isn't it? Something just reminded you of her. I was right, wasn't I? Let's skip it, Jean. Stop interrupting me when .. - I was right. I haven't got a chance, have I. Oh Vic, you're in love with her. Look, Jean. Why don't we go out to a movie? Sure. Why not? Maybe we can find a western with a lot of shooting in it. I don't feel like sitting through a mushy love story. Do you? Vic. Who's there? It's Kay. Honey, you're what was missing. You are what I missed. Me too. I missed you. I missed you so much. You're a long way from home, darling. I suppose I ought to pretend I had sudden urgent business in California. I do, actually. You know what, Mr Norman? You're pretty. Do you know what? You're crazy. I guess I am. I just couldn't stand it any longer. I simply got on a plane. It's like I once said. You're an honest woman. I suppose you're used to this sort of thing. Having women chase you. I hate to tell you this. But hardly anyone ever chases me. Chasing me is a sure sign of insanity. Now that I'm here .. I don't know what to say. Nothing has changed since we had that fight in New York. Yes, it has. A lot has changed. - What? I don't know. When I heard your voice a minute ago, I .. Honey .. do you have a place to stay? I have a reservation on a plane back. I've got two hours. I just wanted to see you again. Why not stick around a while? It's a nice country. Alright. I just wanted to be asked. I know the ropes, like you. Maybe I can get you a room. Maybe I can get you a room. Way over there. Good morning. Mr Norman, we looked all over for you. They want you at the Teletype right now. - Easy. Haven't you heard? All's right with the world. Mr Norman, they've tried to get you all morning on the Teletype. Send two, no, three dozen roses to Mrs Frances Dorrance .. At the Sunset Hills Hotel. Yes, sir. Mr Norman. They're going crazy in New York. I'll tell them you're here. Trouble, huh? Trouble is not what I want this morning. What does it seem to be about? Mr Norman, we've lost Buddy Hare. After all that time you've spent on him. What? We can't lose him. Here it is. 'Kim to Vic'. 'This is serious'. 'Lash gave Keeves Agency ..' 'Option on Hare'. 'Prior to yours'. 'Dave has left us holding the bag'. That Mr Lash, he's so dishonest. No he's not. There must be a mistake. Dave Lash is an honest man. Call him. Tell him I'm on my way over. Tell Mr Kimberly this: 'Relax, Kim. I'll fix it some way. Love and kisses, Vic'. Vic. - Hello, Dave. Meet the legal battery. Harry Spooner and Joe Lawrenson. - How do you do. Vic, the Keeves people called me up a month or so ago. And said no dice on Buddy Hare. Unconsciously, I wrote it off. But Keeves, legally, still have the paper. Keeves, legally, have Buddy Hare. You don't. It's like he said, Mr Norman. Keeves owns Hare. You don't. Besides, I've examined the option you wrote on the train. Any good lawyer could break it in court. - Uhuh. Since when did your office start going in for legal cuties? You know I don't stand for that stuff. - Dave, I have one little idea. It will satisfy Keeves, and it will satisfy me. But it would cost Dave Lash quite a bit of money. How much? - The idea is this. You tell Keeves you'll get them a top comedy name. And you get them a top name at the price they would pay Buddy Hare. You pay the difference. That would run into .. That would cost .. That would cost us a thousand a week for over a year. It might. Mr Lash, let's take this into court. We'll win, and it will only cost you a hundred dollars or so in court fees. You have us on retainer anyway. Dave, can I see you alone for a minute? - Yeah. You heard him, boys. We won't go far. I think you're going to need us. Dave. This is important to me. - I can see that. Do you remember one night on a plane four or five years ago? What night? We happened to be flying East together. I was ready to go in the army. You were going back to New York to attend a certain luncheon. Remember? - Luncheon? I'm not much of a man for luncheons. You were talkative. You said when you were a kid on New York's East side .. That you were arrested for stealing some pennies and sent to reform school. Remember? Sometimes I talk too much. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Later you said you were going back to New York .. To be awarded a scroll by some kind of civic benevolent organization. The kid who'd gone straight. Something about setting a fine example for underprivileged kids like you were. Dave. I think that's something to be proud of. - Well I am proud of it. I give quite a bit of money each year to run boys clubs in my old neighborhood. Decent clubs where kids can get together. Without drifting around the streets or sitting in pool rooms. Why .. they're a great bunch of kids. They've got my picture on the wall of each one of the clubs .. As if I was something terrific. You're going to let those kids down. Let them down? What are you talking about? - Dave, think a minute. When this thing about Buddy Hare gets talked around. It's bound to get around, Dave. You know, there's a lot of people who hate to see a guy like you .. A guy from the wrong side of the tracks, get ahead. What do you think those people are going to say? That an agent made a mistake? No .. you know better than that, Dave. They're going to say it was crooked. Dishonest. They're going to say you can never trust a guy with any kind of a record. How do you think that will look to the kids you're trying to help? How do you think it looks to those kids .. Who think you've done it the hard way and look up to you? Dave, I hit you where you live. And I didn't mean to. The next thing I know, I'll be .. Beating women and kicking children. Dave, I'd consider it a favor if you'd forget I ever said it. What you said is true. Go ahead with your Buddy Hare show. I'll work it out some way. Maybe even the way you suggest. Dave, I've done a rotten thing. I want to ask you to forgive me. You got your Buddy Hare. You won. I ask you to forgive me. I have respect for you, Vic. You got what you came for. This is one time I'd rather be forgiven than respected. Like I said, I have respect for you. And I wish I could say the same for myself. About myself. So now you know. Now you know what a heel I am. Come on, darling. Don't worry about it. Everyone has done things they're ashamed of. I can't imagine you doing anything like that. I rather like being on a pedestal but don't overdo it. We are so lucky, darling. Aren't we? Come on, Kay .. let's walk. Beautiful, isn't it. They call it poetic inspiration. - They should. You didn't answer my question. I said, aren't you we lucky. That we have each other. Nothing else matters. A lot else matters. A lot. Kay. I want you to go back to New York. The first plane we can get you on. Alright, Vic. Don't be like that. That isn't what I mean. I mean I don't want any Blue Penguin Inn. I want everything to be right about us. You know if I bring off this Buddy Hare show, I'll be a man with a good job. A man who can afford to support a house near Sutton Place. Oh .. Vic. Vic, darling. I used to say money is only money. It's clothes for you. School for the kids. Stop being a breadwinner and kiss me. I can't think. - Want some more coffee? No-no, it's no use. I'm dead. I got to go home. - Sit down. You know, I had a wife once. I bet she's gone to Mexico by now. Stop bleating and finish the script. Maybe you'll see her again. Thanks, pal. You know this is the best work you two have done. One more day and we're in. I'll tell you what. - What? Maybe it will give us an idea. Read the script aloud again. No, Vic. Not that. If you read the jokes just once more, so help me, I'll kill myself. Let's hope Evans doesn't feel the same when I get to New York with the record. On the other hand, let's hope he does. Hello, Vic. Do you ever go to bed? - Get into my car. We must hurry. What for? - Evans called a meeting now. At two o'clock in the morning? - You know Evans. Tell me, what happened? Did everything go alright? It was a good audition. Buddy Hare was as funny as can be expected. I have the record here. - Where you going? I have to make a phone call. Evans can wait. Can't you make your phone call later, Vic? [ Telephone ] Hello? Vic. My darling, where are you? I'm in La Guardia Field. You sound so warm and sleepy. I've missed you, darling. Do you love me? I adore you. I'll throw on some clothes and you come over here right away. I can't. Meet me at Evans' office. Stay in your car. Park on the Wall Street side. When you get there, blow the horn three times. To say hello. This is it, honey. This is where I take them for our year's income. I have to go now. The man who is about to pay our grocery bill awaits. Remember honey. Three times. Let's go. Why take a chance on irritating the old man at this time? I wouldn't think of irritating him just now. It's too important to me now. - So come on, come on. Kim. I'm in love. I'm engaged. That's fine, Vic. Fine. I'll congratulate you in the car. - It's Kay. Kay Dorrance. No kidding. Wonderful, Vic. - She has two children. I know. I saw their pictures. Remember? You can tell me all about it in the car. Children cost money. Nurses and cereals and things. Kim, make it 35 thousand instead of 25. Look, Vic. If you think you can get away with .. Okay. 35 thousand dollars a year if Evans okays you. Plus bonuses. Plus bonuses. - Okay, Chum. Now let's go take care of Evan Llewellyn Evans. This place feels like a morgue. Vic, I wish you wouldn't say things like that. It's locked. The transcription, please. Mr Evans wants to hear it first. Without you. Give her the records. You're both to wait here. Welcome home, Mr Norman. He's building up to something. I'm worried. - You're always worried. Are those records alright? Is the show alright? In my opinion it makes people laugh. If they to want to laugh. As for Evans, how do I know? That singer? How did the drummer girl turn out? I didn't use a drummer girl. - You didn't? I think we get a brand-new singing star. Who? - You know. A girl named Jean Ogilvie. - Jean Ogilvie? Vic. A nightclub singer. A nobody. Everybody was a nobody once. - Yeah, but lots of them stay nobodies. Take it easy, Kim. - Take it easy? Something is cooking. There has been ever since you refused to send an outline of the Buddy Hare show. He hasn't mentioned it since. He is setting the stage for something. Look, Kim. We can't lose. - Why can't we lose? I told you. Because I'm in love now and I can use him. I'll not let him tie a can on our tails just the minute I need him. I won't let the old goat do that to us. - Shush, Vic. Not so loud. He may have the place wired. I think I'm going to be sick. Cut it out will you. You're beginning to get me Evans-happy. - It's about time. You may come in, now. Good morning, Mr Norman. - Good morning, sir. Good morning, Kimberly. - Good morning, Mr Evans. Allison, bring me the letter I wrote earlier this evening. I take the position that a man either knows where he's going or he doesn't. Right? - Right. Right. This letter is to my youngest son. Evan Llewellyn Evans the 3rd. Dear son, you've been overseas in the army of occupation .. For seven months and three days at this time of writing. My son, I detect a profound note of discouragement in your letters to me. My dear Captain Evan Llewellyn Evans the 3rd. I take the position that a man knows where he's going or he doesn't. And if he doesn't he must chat-chat with himself and his associates. Not to go off half-cocked on his own. Check? Check. - Check. That, son, is what I call organization. As it applies to an individual as well as a group. The rest of the letter is personal. I wonder if my son will get the point. It's a beautifully made point, Mr Evans. Excellent. Makes me wish I had a son to write to. The letter has a bearing on that province. Mr Norman, you chose to go off on your own and make an audition record. You chose to ignore our normal procedure of chat-chat. Chat-chat, and double chat-chat. You went off by yourself and did things your own way. Tonight we heard the records. Tangible proof of what comes of you going off on your own. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, right? Right. After hearing those records, I can only say .. That you, as an individual .. Are well organized. Your program is excellent, Mr Norman. Excellent .. right? Right. Frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised if it wasn't. But it was. It was good. And that singer. That Jean Ogilvie. Now, that's a voice. Over there .. over there. Rat-tat-de-ta-dat-dah-dah. Ha-ha. Mr Norman .. I congratulate you. You wear the mantle of Beautee Soap now. Mr Kimberly, have you discussed salary with Mr Norman? We've talked about $35,000 a year plus bonuses. Mr Norman, is that satisfactory to you? Thirty-five thousand dollars a year is a lot of money. A lot of money. Right? - Right. Right now, I'm a man who needs money. Mr Evans. Tonight, you had a little sport with me. A little sadistic sport. A childish thing of no importance. You got me to say 'right' when you wanted me to. And you succeeded in introducing me to your general manager. Your foreman. - My foreman? Your foreman: fear. Your overseer: fear. The thing that keeps these people in line for you. I didn't know about 'fear' before but I do now. I know what it is to be so worried about your job .. That you'll kick around a perfectly nice guy like David Lash. A guy who's never been anything but kind. A guy who does a lot of good for a lot of people. I'll tell you something. I don't like being made to feel afraid. Mr Evans, there isn't enough money in the world to make me work for you. Vic! Heaven knows Mr Evans, you're a big one. The big, rich, successful one. But there are others. Tyrants, despots. You and your kind, wherever you do business. I think for a man like you .. To control so much of what goes over the air into the homes of America is .. It's all so wet. See what I mean? Darling. What's the matter? Darling, they didn't like your show? I am sorry. They liked the show. They liked it fine. Then what in the world has ..? - Kay. I've something to say you won't like. Get in the car. Let's drive up to your house. Darling, what's this? Where are we? Bolton market. They start early down here. Vic, I can't stand it any longer. What is it that's wrong? Honey. Bad news. I must get you firmly seated in your own living room before I tell you. No. Now, Vic. Please, I'm really quite a big girl. You are going to tell me now. Darling, I see you troubled too often with what you've been doing. What is it? What is it? I just threw away my job. I got fed up. You and I will have to wait a long time before we can be married. That's what I wanted to tell you. So, if you want out, Kay .. I see. It's a matter of self-respect. Getting out of the army. I don't know. Things look different to me. I was becoming .. Like that guy over there. Aye, aye, aye. Step right down here friends and get your fountain pens. You can't afford to be without one. Now here they are. You understand, Kay? Of course I understand. You're such a child, darling. You now hate the business you're in and just want to drop it and .. Go and live on a beach in Tahiti or something. That's an idea. But Vic, you're too good for that. Why don't you sell things you believe in? And sell them with dignity and taste? That's a career for any man. A career to be proud of. What's wrong with that? Nothing .. nothing at all. Except. This is all I have in the world. It takes a long time. All that time no dough for clothes for you or nurses. That's it, isn't it. When you say money, you mean big money. That just doesn't matter, Vic. That's not something you base a life on. If you do, then you're Kimberly. But us ..? Oh, Vic. You wonderful dope. You and I are going to get married just as soon as we get a license. And then you'll do what you want to do. That's what matters. Doing what you want to. Not money. You mean that, don't you. - Yes, I do. Well, you asked for it. Who's going to have the next one? What did you do that for? Now we start out with exactly an even nothing in the world. It's neater that way. ..t-g..
