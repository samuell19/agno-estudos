(match lights) (fire roaring) (suspenseful music) - Hey Donny, watch your eyes, man. (fire roaring) (metal clanks) - Yo, Ben! You coming to lunch or what? - Nah, I gotta take my kid to the doctor. - Okay, I'll see you later. (fire roaring) (explosion) (yelling out in pain) (alarm bell rings) (high pitched tone sounds) (screaming) - Hey, over here. - Stupid son of a bitch, what are you standing there for? Ya hear me, you crazy bastard? Come over here and help us! What's the matter with you? - Come on, leave him alone. Let's take care of Ben. - Yeah, let's take care of Ben. - Give me your hand, Ben. (alarms fade away, fire blazes) - Do you realize Ben nearly died because of you? A man goes up in flames, and you stand there like a nut case. - I'm not a nut case. - What? - I'm not a nut case. It just covered. Covered him up. It wasn't evil, but it covered him up. - What are you talking about? I covered Ben. - No, the cover of flame. The cover of the flame. - You know you're crazy. I always said you were crazy. - You stay away from me. You think I was afraid? You think I'm crazy? - What are you talking about-- - I would have helped him. - What are you talking about? You're a sicko. (locker doors close, keys rattle) - [Voiceover] Chief Daily, line 91. Chief Daily pick up nine, one. - Hey Donny. Donny wait a minute. Hey let's go have a beer, man. - No, thanks, I I gotta get home. - Oh well, so do I, but let's go have a beer anyway. Come on. - I can't, my mother's sick. - Okay, but wait a minute, now listen. I don't want you to go home thinking that was your fault, man. Because I mean, things can happen and a guy can freeze in a situation like that, you know? - Hey, that's right. - Yeah. - That's right. He's the one that's sick. He's the nut case, not me. - Hey, you're probably right about that. - You know that's the way those people are. They call you names, and they're the crazy ones. - He's a light weight, don't worry about it. - But that's the way it happened. You're right Bobby. Hey, I froze I couldn't-- - You know, speaking of freezing, I'm going to go find a nice warm bar stool. Why don't you come along, huh? - Nah, I can't. - Okay, alright. Well see you tomorrow night. Okay? - Okay. See you tomorrow. (car door slams, engine starts) (spooky music) - [Whispering Voices] That's right, go home. Go home, like a good boy. Mama is waiting. - Mother I'm home. I'll have your tea ready in a minute. (creepy whimsical music) - [Little Donny] No mother, don't. (tea tray rattles) I made you chamomile tea since you've been having so much trouble sleeping lately. There, it's nice and hot. Oh, you're already asleep. Don't you want your tea? I made you tea. Mother? Mother? Are you alright? Mother? (suspenseful music) No. Wake up. Mother. Wake up. Please, wake up. Please, wake up! Mother! (rotary dial clacks) What am I going to do now? It's not true. It's not. She's going to wake up. She's just asleep. Fast asleep. She's going to wake up soon. Mom, come on! Wake up! Now stop it! I made you tea. Drink your tea! - [Whispering Voices] She's evil. Evil. You're not afraid. You're not afraid, you don't have to be afraid. You're not alone. We're here. We're here to help you. You're free now. You're free. You can do anything you want to. - Free? - [Whispering Voices] We'll help you, don't worry. We'll help you. - You will? - [Whispering Voices] You can do anything you want to do. Now you're free. - Can I play my music loud? - [Whispering Voices] (evil laugh) ("Late Night Surrender" by the Daryll Barber Band) - Donald. Don't you dare. - [Whispering Voices] She's still dead. She'll see you. She must be purified. She talked to you since laying. She wants you to be over there. In the everlasting night. She wants the flame. It's your turn. You can do it. You're the master of the flame now. You'll get it. It's up to you. You're the master. That's right. (creepy whimsical music) (match strikes and gas ignites) - Donald, come here. - No mother. - You're a bad boy. You're evil, and you must be punished. - No mother, please don't. I promise I'll be good. - Come here I said. - No mother, please. No. - Your father let you do things like that, but he's gone now. (struggles, cries and screams) - I'll burn the evil out of you. - No, no. (match lights) - [Donny] (laughing weirdly) (hammer tapping against metal) (phone rings) - Hello? - Hey, hey Donny. How ya doing man? It's Bobby. - Okay. - You alright? - Why shouldn't I be alright? - Well, I thought you might still be a little upset about Ben. - Ben? - Yeah, Ben at work. You know, the fire and everything. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, no. I'm alright. - Good. Hey listen man, I thought you might want to meet me for a cup of coffee before work. - Why? - What do you mean why? God man, I thought you might want to talk or something. - Oh. That's nice of you, but I'm not going in today. I have a couple of things I have to take care of. Will you tell them I won't be in? - Yeah, sure I'll tell them. Okay, well look. I'll see ya tomorrow then, huh? - Goodbye. (hammer tapping in distance) - [Whispering Voices] You'll get all of them now. That's right, it's up to you. You're the master. (suspenseful music) (bell rings above door) (knocking) - We're closed. - Could I just get something simple? Something that's already arranged? Something that wouldn't be too much trouble. - I'm sorry we're closed. - I need a present for my mother, she's sick. Just something nice. It doesn't have to be too much trouble. - Your mother? - She's sick, you know. She loves flowers. Just something simple, please? - Okay, something simple. (bell rings, door closes) I think I've got just what you want. (creepy music) - Oh that's beautiful. I'm sure mother will love that. - Well, I guess that'll do it. That's $4.50, please. - Thank you. - I hope your mother feels better. - Oh yeah, thanks. Mother will feel fine. Just fine. (bell over door rings) - Good night. - Good night. (bell rings) - She's trouble. - Yeah, you're right man. I ought to know. (bus engine revs) - Hey, hold it. (bus revs away) - Hey, I'd wait for her. (men laugh together) - Hey baby, I'll walk you home. - Woo. - Whoa. - You're too ugly, bitch. - That's right, come on. - Woo. (men chuckle and laugh) - Hey Miss, I could give you a lift to the next bus station. - Hey baby, I'll give you a ride. - That's the way I go. (laughing and whooping) - Well, I'm going to River Road. - I go right past there, I could give you a lift. - Oh, okay. - No, don't go. - Don't leave us now. - Yeah, come on. - Oh we blew it. - Yeah, we did. - Oh, you broke my heart. Oh, woe is me. - I appreciate your help. - It's my pleasure. I ought to thank you for letting me get these flowers. If it wasn't for me, you would have made your bus. - You know you should get these in water as soon as you get home. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hum. - I'll do that. Are you in a big rush? - Well, yeah. I want to get home. - Well, would you mind if I dropped these off at my house first? It'll only take a minute. It's not far from River Road. - Alright. - My mother is already fixing dinner, and I'm really late. So, I'll just drop them off and I'll tell her I'll be right back. - No, no, it's alright. (truck engine revs up hill) - I'll only be a minute. (door slams) Hey, I forgot the package. Could you hand me that? Thanks. Hey, why don't you come on in, and say hello to mother. - Oh, no. - Oh she'll get a kick out of it, and then we can go. - No, really. I've got to-- - Oh, come on. She never sees anybody. - Really, I just-- - Oh, come on. Please. - Okay. - Careful now. (suspenseful music) (key turns in lock) - Mother I'm home.

Well, let me go get mother. Mother must be upstairs. - (gasps) Mother? (door opens, footsteps approach) Mother is even sicker than I thought. I have to call a doctor and get him right over here. You understand, I can't leave her in this condition. - As soon as you've finished, I'd like call a cab. (phone disk rattles and turns) - Dr. Wells, this is Donald Kohler, it's mother again, she's worse than before, she can't get out of bed. Could you come right over? Yes. Oh would you? Would you? Thank you very much. The doctor will be right over, if you wait a couple of minutes I can give you a ride home. - Look I know you have your hands full here, I'd just like to call a cab, okay? - But if you wait a few minutes, the doctor-- - Look may I please use the phone? - Are you asking for my permission? - Yes, may I please use the phone. - Yes, you may. (rotor turns) (suspenseful music) - Hello, would you please send a cab to-- (yells and phone crashes to floor) (moaning, chains rattle) - Oh, please help! (creepy whimsical music) (match strikes, gas ignites) - Donald. Come here. (moaning and grunting) - Please, help me. Help me. Oh no! (door slams) (whimpers and cries) (crying grows louder) Please, help. Don't. Please. (loud pained screaming) (elevator door rattles open) - You're a friend of that guy. You tell him from me, if he isn't back here Monday, he's out of a job. - Give a guy a break. He's been sick, he's got problems. - Sick? - Yeah. - If he's sick how come he doesn't answer the phone? - Well did his mother answer? - Nobody answered. - Well, maybe he's taking her to the doctor or something. - Look, I don't care if they took each to the doctor. He's been out a week now, so that's it. Then he'll be in the hospital for a different reason. You just tell him what I said. (elevator bangs shut) (sighs) (engine sputters and stalls) - Can't get it started? - It just stalled out on me. It won't do anything. - Could I give you a lift to the next gas station? - I would really appreciate that. - You won't mind if I drop these things off at my house first? It's on the way. - No, that's okay. (creepy music) - And when I tell you not to take something off a shelf, you better listen to me. (child yelling and crying) - Will that be all? - And two packs of 120. (cash register whirling, it's bell rings) - That's $4.99, out of $5. - Thank you. - There you go. - Can I help you with that package? - No thanks. - Can I give you a ride home. (sighs and groans) My truck right outside. Why don't you let me give you a ride home. - Will you please just get out of my way. - Is there a problem here? - No, there's no problem. No problem. I must have scared her, huh? I'm going to go apologize. Hey Miss! Miss! (creepy music) Mother, this is Linda. I wanted you to meet her before I introduce her to the others. (phone rings) Hello. - Hey Donny. It's Bobby. - Oh, hi Bobby. - Hi, hey listen man. I got a message from Vito for ya. Now he says that if you don't show up to work, on Monday. You're out of a job. (startling music) Hey Donny, did you hear what I said? Okay listen man, all I'm trying to do is help you out. And all you're giving me is nothing, so have a nice life, huh? - Wait a minute, listen to me Bobby. Hey, I'm in a lot of trouble. I'm scared. - What kind of trouble, what's the matter? - It's my mother, she's sick. You know and, I'm real worried. Bobbie. - So you want me to come over? We can talk about it. - No, no. You can't come over right now. Father Garritty is going to come over, cause, my mother's sick, and she hasn't been able to get to church. - Now wait a minute, Garritty? Now what's that old witch doctor gonna do for her? - Well he knows what to do. He knows. - Okay, okay. But now listen, give me a call if you need anything. And hey Donny, I really hope that you get to work on Monday, man. - Listen Bobby, thanks for calling me. I think you're only friend I have out there. - It's alright. I'll see ya man. - [Mrs. Kohler] Trash. Trash. Just like your father. - No. - Oh yes, he got away. But you won't. You'll pay. You'll suffer. - No. You'll have to suffer now. - [Whispering Voices] She's evil. She can't hurt you now. We'll help you punish her. We'll help you. - That's right. I have my friends with me. If she doesn't stop it, I'll punish her again. You hear that old lady? I'll punish you again. Do you hear me? Did you hear what I said? Don't you ever talk to me like that. That's better. Don't make me do anything bad, mother. (women laughing and giggling) You laughing at me? You think I'm crazy for talking to my mother like that? You don't know what she did. You weren't here. Nobody was here. I spent my whole life in this house. With her. I was five when my father left me. She hated him. So she hated me. He was too big to push around. He was a big man. Much bigger than me. But he took a lot of abuse from her. See this? He needed it, you know? Used to hide it. I have it now. And I still hide it. Out of respect for him. (mournful music) (liquid pours) You laugh. What do you know? She used to say I was the reason things weren't working out. When my father was here. He used to protect me. When he left, I had no one. She made everyday of my life a nightmare. Sometimes I wake up, in the middle of the night. She'd be standing over me, screaming. Screaming like a mad woman. You understand? Hey? You're not listening to me. You're not paying attention to a word I'm saying. You're all witches. Selfish and vain. Except you. The new one. You're different. You try to be nice. You try to listen to me. (giggling) Don't you dare laugh at me. (smack) I won't stand for impudence. From any of you. That's the trouble. I've taken too much crap in my life. That's all changed now. No more of that for Donny Kohler. Vito, that bum down at work. Tried to push me around. But I stood up to him. I beat the hell out of him. (laughs) Should have seen him. Whimpering when I was finished with him. And all the guys, came up to me and congratulated me. And thanked me. For putting him in his place. None of them could do it. But I did. He won't try to do it to me again. I'll push his face in. Eh, what am I talking to you for? If any of you take even a sip, I'll know it. Understand? I'll know it. And besides. I don't like to see girls drink. So don't get smart with me. If you promise to be good, I'll leave the lights on. And remember, no more laughing. (suspenseful music) (door thuds shut) (rock music plays) (creepy music) (yells and screams) (rock music playing) (suspenseful music playing with rock in background) (water running) (latch clicks open) (intense music) (gasps) - [Mrs. Kohler] I'll get you Donald. I'll get you. (yells) (door squeaks open and thuds shut) (soft violin music) - What are you doing here? (trunk lid shuts loudly) Donny. Donny Kohler. I thought you told me you'd never come back here? Oh, you came to get holy water. You don't have to steel it. - Doesn't it put out the flame? - Flame? You have a problem? - Yes. - Let me help you with this. - Do you believe in the devil? - What kind of a question is that to ask a priest? - Do you? - I believe in evil, yes. As for the pitch fork carrying kind with the tail, I believe that was an interpretation, a vision of another era. They may have needed that in another time. - So you don't believe it exists? - No, it doesn't exist. Unless you want it too. - What about the punishment of evil? If a person is born evil, shouldn't they be punished. - Donny, what's troubling you? I haven't seen you in a long time, and you seem like a happy enough young man. What are these questions now, what kind of punishment are you referring too? - To those born in sin. To women who are evil. Isn't it right? - Donny, every christian is baptized. The ceremony joyously welcomes them into the community of Christ's world. While washing away the taint of the original sin of his forefathers. - I was told by my blessed mother, that we are born evil. That the evil must be burned away with the flame. Was my mother lying? Are you calling my mother a lair? - Donny you're mother wasn't lying. I know your mother a long time. She was always very interested, very concerned with our religion. When she told you about sin being burned out, she was referring to a symbol. To a symbol of God's power. - You have all the answers. All the things you read in books. All the things you tell people. Look at these symbols. I was burned just like in hell. - What is this? What happened to your arms? - It was the punishment for my sins. - Who did this to you? Tell me. - My mother. My mother. Help me. - You mean your mother did this to you? But why? - Because I was evil. I was born from an evil deed. She was burning it out of me, to save me. If I was bad, she burned me. If I had evil thoughts. She would burn me. Do you understand me? - I understand your anger now. But your mother's an old woman. When your father left, she was deeply hurt. - She hated him. And she hated me. - No, Donny. No. - Yes. - You must forgive those who have trespassed, you must forgive your mother. Donny? I want to help you. Do you believe me? - Yes. - Do you want my help? - Yes. - Then do as I tell you. Put these thoughts of evil out of your mind now. Resist them and you'll find peace. Don't you want that? - Yes. Yes I do. But there are other things. Other people. - Come back to me. Come to my office. Come to confession if you like. You haven't been in a while, have you? - Only-- - Come back and see me. (creepy music) (door squeaks open and shuts) - Mother please forgive me. I told the priest because he wanted to help me. I didn't do anything wrong. I can change. I want to forget our past. I want to forgive you. Please. Help me forgive her. I just talked to mother and explained my feelings to her. There are going to be some changes here. I... I'm going to forget my past. I talked to the priest, and he says I can change if I want to. You hear me? That's better. I don't want to have to hurt you any longer. I can change. I can do it. - [Whispering Voices] Donny, Donny. You must burn more. More. - No. - [Whispering Voices] You must burn the evil, Donny. Purify them with the flame. You must destroy evil. Get them. Get them, Donny. - Here they are. See for yourselves. - [Whispering Voices] There are more. There are always more. Burn the evil. - No. I won't. I've burned the evil. They're here in this room. - [Whispering Voices] You should listen to us, Donny. You should. You'll be sorry, Donny. You'll be sorry. Donny. (creepy music) (women vocalizing eerily) (door shuts) (phone rings) - Hello. - Is Bobby there? - Bob, it's for you. - Hello. - Bobby? - Yeah, who's this? - It's Donny. - Hey Donny! This is a surprise, what are you up to man? - Nothing. I'm not up to nothing. I just thought you might want to go to a movie or something. - Now wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You sure you don't want to stay home tonight? - Come on. - Hey listen, if you're really serious about doing something tonight. I got something we can do, man. And it ain't no movie, ya know? Guess what I got lined up for tonight? Two. Two live ones, man. And let me tell you, they are dynamite. You know what they're into? - No. What? - I can't go into detail right now, but take my word for it, they are dynamite. - Well, I thought we could spend kind of a quite night together, just talk. Or something like that. - Are you kidding, this is perfect. Now my wife thinks I'm working the weekend shift, okay? I got all the calls made, okay. I'm all covered, and I don't feel like sitting in some dumb movie holding your hand, no offense. - Well wait a minute. I didn't mean that. - Look, meet me at the Palace Disco tonight at 8:00, alright. That's it. - Well if I can't be there? - I'll see you at 8:00, okay? - Okay, Bobby. I'll see you at 8:00. - See ya then. (sports caster calling game on TV) (dishes clatter in kitchen) - Bob, I'm going to kill this kid if you don't get him out of here. (creepy whimsical music) - Oh, these are nice. - And here's another item, I think you'll really be happy with. - Come on, lets go. - Okay, thanks anyway. - I'm sorry I couldn't have been of more help. - Bye, bye. ("Boogie Lights" by Daryll Barber Band plays in background) - Yes sir, can I be of help to you? - Well could you show me, that shirt? The one they were looking at? - Oh, sure. - The red one. - Oh the Matador. - The Matador? - This shirt, they styling, that's what it's called. - Oh, yes. I forgot the matador, I've seen this before. Very interesting. - Yes. - Nice styling. What did that lady think? She liked it, didn't she? - To tell you the truth she thought it was tacky. - Oh. - What do you think? - If you could tell me if this was for a business occasion, or a casual affair, I could be of much more help. - Well I was looking for something you could wear to a disco. - Okay, lets get to the right department, shall we? Just come this way. I just got these in. This is what they're all wearing. Unless you're into the more wild look. Which is really passe. That's a beautiful plaid, isn't it? Well I'll tell you the truth, for the disco scene I think this is what you want. Well why don't you take that shirt? What size are you? 15 and a half? - Yeah. - There you are. Can I set you up with an entire ensemble? - Okay. - Groovy, just come this way. Make a new man of you in no time. This three piece suite would be terrific with that shirt. But its not made for dancing. (mumbles) Now why don't you just take these into the dressing room, try these on and see if they fit? - No, that's alright. I'll try them on at home. - Oh, fine then. We'll get you a new pair of shoes then, shall we? Al? Oh, what size sir. - I don't know, nine I think. - Measure him Alfred. Well, I'll just have these wrapped up, if they're satisfactory of course. - What do you think? - I think it's a dynamite outfit. - Really? - You'll steel the show.

(giggles and laughs) - Thanks! (giggles and laughs) - Excuse my appearance, but I just got jumped. - Really? - What? - He was jumped. - Oh, you were? What happened? - Couple of guys came out of no place. They jumped me in a parking lot. Three of them. - Really? - Yeah, three guys with knives. - Oh wow. - Just now? - Yeah. - Where was this? - Back in town. - Well, what they'd do? Take your money? - They wanted to, but I showed them. They didn't know who they were messing with. They thought they had themselves a real pushover. - Well what'd you do? - I beat the hell out of all three of them. - (laughs) - I was in Marines. Green Beret. - I thought the Green Beret was the Army. - Well, this was just like the Green Beret. It was a special division. (girls laugh and giggle) - Oi Patty, you think Jeff is going to be there? If Jeff is going to be there, I don't want to go. - You going to start with that again? - Who's Jeff? - Oh he's this real ass. - Janice and Billy, and all the rest of them are going to be there. We'll just sit with them. Ignore him. - I can't just ignore him, he follows me around. He's such a drag. - Well you picked a hell of a time to start this. We're almost there now, and all of a sudden you decide you don't want to go. - I just realized, I don't want to be hassled all night long. - Wait a minute. Hold it. Take it easy. Why don't we go to my house. You can call anybody you want to see, and we can have a party right there. - Yeah? - Nobody will mind? - No. - We can invite anybody we want? - Yeah.
