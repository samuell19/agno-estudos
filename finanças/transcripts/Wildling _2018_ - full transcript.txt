- Do you want to hear a story? Do you want me to tell you about the Wildling? His teeth are long and sharp, like this. And so are his nails. Long and sharp, like this. And his hair is long and black, all over his whole body. Do you wanna hear more? No? Okay. You're my special, little berry. Good morning, Anna. - Good morning, Daddy. - I'm gonna listen to your heart, and then I'm gonna tell you to breathe. Okay, now, breathe in. Okay. And now I'm getting worried. We do not see you around anymore. Hunt's over. Sure, but that don't mean you can just disappear. Roger, I'm retired. 'Alright, I'll see you-- - I'm sorry the door gave you a sting. I told you about that. It's made so that the Wildling will get hurt if he tries to get in. - Why does he wanna get in? - Because you're the last one left. He ate all the other children. - Who was that today? I heard someone talking. - There is no one. There is only Anna and Daddy. Anna and Daddy. There is only Anna and Daddy. But only Daddy can go outside because Anna is too small. Anna must always stay inside. Anna must stay inside. ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday ♪ ♪ Dear Anna ♪ Close your eyes. Okay. Now, open them. I plucked him from the berry bush. - It was evident that the youngster had become SC accustomed-- - accustomed. Accustomed to the marvels... One, two, three, four, five, six, four, seven, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - He's in a better place. I'm gonna take him to where I plucked him, and I'm going to bury him there. And then, after awhile, a bush will grow out of him, and then when the spring comes, it'll grow new berries. - And Dusty will grow back? _ Yes, but it will be a new Dusty. - What's wrong with me? - You're sick. Anna, this is medicine, and Daddy needs to see your tummy. Good girl. Now Daddy's gonna put the medicine in your tummy, and it's gonna sting, okay? Anna, close your eyes. Now, One, tw0, three. Good girl. We're gonna have to do this everyday. H eY, Anna? It's your birthday. Don't you wanna count your bears? - DaddY, can you take me to the better place? Maybe a bush will grow out of me. - You'll close your eyes, then you'll go to sleep. And there'll be nothing. Nope. Rate to 1,000. Her EP is at 4.31. Very good, we're pushing 1,000 milligrams. And with her metmyelocytes. Wait now, slow down, don't take off. - M. It's okay. I'm here to help you. I'm the one who found you. Your neighbors called me to report a gunshot. Sheriff Ellen Cooper. I have a few questions to ask you, would that be okay? Yeah? What's your name? - Anna. It's nice to meet you, Anna. What's your last name? - Anna. - Officer? Can I talk with you for a minute? - You sit tight. We detected a high concentration of leuprorelin in her system. One more day and we probably would have lost her. - What's that? - It's typically used to treat endometriosis, urine fibroids, or conditions such as paraphilia. The thing is, she's got none of those. A doctor wouldn't even be able to justify this kind of treatment. - Do you think he was poisoning her? . Ah! It's a pretty heavy drug, with a wide range of drastic side effects, but it is very efficient at down regulating the secretion of estrogen in a woman's body. There's no evidence of any menstrual cycle. At all. I think whoever did this to her wants to slow down her maturity. - That's fucked up. - Yeah, I'll leave you to it. Thank you, doctor. - Yeah. - Dr. Bector? Paging Dr. Becker. - Anna? I'm gonna undo these straps for you, okay? It's okay. Just gonna undo these straps. Like that. It's okay. There you go. - Where's Daddy? Is he in the better place? - Good morning, everyone. So, the doctors have told me what a bright, young girl you are, and how well you responded over the past week to all their crazy tests. I bet you're just about ready to get outta here, huh? Well, we think you're ready to move on, too. So, The Bellington House is a wonderful place. They have a wide variety of special therapeutic programs designed for girls just like you, and it's a lot more fun than a hospital. - Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I gotta say, locking her up again doesn't really sound like the right strategy here. - With all due respect, Sheriff, I think we can trust Dr. Rooney's expertise. - We haven't even received the DNA results yet. It seems a little - Well, as I was just explaining to our - bit premature to-- - patient, The Bellington House is the per-- - I'm gonna go with her. Well, uh, we'll see about that. - So you're gonna be with me until your DNA results come in. DNA is something that we use to identify any relatives that you might have. That gal looks familiar. - Until then, I'm gonna be responsible for you. You okay with that? You don't like my driving? We're going less than 20 miles an hour, it's safe. I mean, not in general, if you know, for example, you were driving under the influence, but, I don't drink, so no need to worry about that. - You don't drink? - Not anymore. - You must be very thirsty. - Not many vegetarians in this town. I can't believe you did that. You didn't even say anything. - I know. - Stop it. - Little shit. Hey, what are you thinking? C'mon, let's go. - You wanna stay away from guys like that. Yeah, 38, we got a... Are you hungry? I'm not a great cook, but I know what goes with ketchup. Pretty good, huh? - Who's this? - Anna, this is Ray. Ray this is Anna. The girl I was telling you about from the hospital. - Why is she wearing my clothes? - Because she's our guest, and because she needs something to wear. You never wear that shirt, anyways, so why do you care? What happened to your head? - It's none of your fucking business. - Excuse me, language, young man. - Are you his daddy? No, I'm not his daddy, I'm his sister. Only men can be daddy's and women are mom's. Everyone has them, whether you like it or not. I'm sorry, it smells a bit musty in here 'cause we don't use this room very often. Okay, here ya g0- Well, if you, ah, you need anything, I'm, I'm just across the hall, okay? Okay? - Can we close it? - Are you cold? - The Wildling. - What's the Wildling? - He eats children. - Oh. Did your daddy tell you that? Have you ever seen him, a Wildling? - In my dreams. - Listen, Anna, I've been to a lot of places, and I've never seen a Wildling before. It's okay, you're safe here. You get some rest. You've had a long day. Goodnight. HeY' Good morning. You okay in there? It's seven, time for breakfast. Whoa. - We only moved her for Ellen's job. Right after our parents died. If we were still in the city, we'd be taking the subway. No subway sucks. No cell phone signal anywhere, ever, sucks. Only one single chain restaurant and that's Dairy Queen. It sucks. I told you, they're not hamsters, and they're not babies, either. 'No? Do you wanna see where you really come from? Well, this should give you the general idea. Oh, yes. - I got a little something for you. You know, that's what you use when you're bleeding down there? - So it's medicine? - No, no, no, you're not sick, you're a woman. Race, 79. - Woo, go lady Grizzlies. Do you know where the library is? - Very nice. - Yeah, I'll show you. Girls, let's go back to the start. One more run. - The party is this Saturday. It's at my house. So, you should definitely come cause you'll get to meet everyone. It will be super fun. - Thank you. - Bye. Yeah, yeah, probably. - She's barefoot. - I think she's the girl that was kept in father's attic. 'Oh, my God, really? Like a sex slave? Yeah. - She must be retarded. Oh. - Hey, hi, excuse me, Miss? Hi, are you looking for something? - I'm, I'm looking for Ray. He was supposed to meet me at library after school. - You know, you should really be more careful, there's like broken glass and shit. I might be able to help ya out. C'mon, let me out. - What you think? - Sure. You guys are so hilarious. - Ray, you never told us you had a girlfriend. - I don't. - Oh, then what are you, fuck buddies? - You're a riot. - Hey, buddy, you forgot something. - Who was smokin' pot? - No one. Oh, good boy, that's a good boy. Make sure he remembers that. 'Mm-hmm. - Hey, that was very impressive. What's your name? - You're not doing me any favors. - You always go up like this against the grain. My dad taught me how to do this. He used to shave every single day of his life. Not his legs, his face. Anna, there's something that I need to talk to you about. Those DNA tests came back. They show that Gabriel Hanson is not your real father. He's not your daddy. - What? - Do you remember what I said about moms and dads? - Everyone has 'em. - Yeah. We're still not sure who your real mom and dad are. I don't think the state's gonna let you stay with me forever. We're gonna have to find you a more permanent home. - You can't escape so easily. The test is Monday, and you've only gone through half of your stuff. So, what do you know about the Declaration of Independence? C'mon, if you flunk this, Ellen is gonna kill me. - Have you ever been to the Northern Lights? - No, you can't see them from here. - Why? - 'Cause they're really, really far north where there's no more people. I'd actually like to see the Northern Lights, too. My mom, she showed me pictures when I was like, this. - Uh, what are you doing? - You smell. - I smell? - Like a hamburger. - I've never gotten that one before. - What's that? - What? - There. - Ah, I think Jen's having a party. - I know Jen. - How do you know her? - She's my friend. - Hey, where are you guys going? - To a Party- - Ah, you don't wanna party with me? I thought we were gonna fire up the grill? - Yeah, but couldn't we do that tomorrow? - Yeah, sure. - Well, why don't you come to the party? - Oh, I don't think Ellen would wanna come to this kind of party. - What kind party, - C'mon. - Is this kinda party? - It's at Jen's house. - Ah, yeah, we're gonna be home before midnight. - Hi, who are you again? - Anna. - Anna, come on in. Thank you. - You're with a girl. Good for you. Hey, buddy, why didn't you bring your mommy? She's my sister, asshole. I didn't know you could fart out of your mouth. Ooh, the hidden talents, man, hidden talents. - Here, don't drink it too fast. It's great.

Anna, what's the matter? Anna, I can take you home. Come out, and let's go. Anna? Anna, would you please open the door? It's made so that the Wildling will get hurt if he tries to get in. Why does he wanna get in? Because you're the last one left. He killed all the other children. You look familiar. - Anna? Are you okay, where have you been? Anna? Did someone hurt you? Come. Ray and I have been looking for you everywhere. Anna, listen, I, I want you to know that you trust me, okay? You can tell me anything. I really need to know what happened last night. Where you've been and what happened to your dress? Did someone try and hurt you or touch you in anyway? - Roger. - Hey, you need any help with her? - No, I'm fine, thank you. - Well, here's the thing. Richard Fuller just called, and his 18 year old son, Lawrence, was also at that party, and he didn't come home either. Um, he was last seen around 11 p.m. and Tom and I asked the kids, but no one seemed to see him leave, so, well, well I thought maybe we should ask her. - I think you should let me handle that. Anna, you need to talk to me. Anna, you need to tell me what happened at that party last night. You don't wanna be painting your nails right now. I'm trying to help you, I can't help you - Ellen? - If you won't talk to me. - What's going on? Are you okay? - Ray, what do you know about Lawrence Fuller? - Huh, you mean besides being an asshole? - Well, that asshole is missing. - You think that Anna had something to do with this? Is that what's going on here? - I want her to tell me where she was last night, she won't talk. - Ellen, - I need for you to tell me where you were - I think it would be better, - last night. - If I talked to her. - Oh, you do? - Yes, alone. - Yeah? - Yeah Thank you. Don't worry, I won't tell her about the blood. Anna, you can't do stuff like this. How am I supposed to protect you? Let me see. Ellen? Ellen? 'Yeah? We need to take her to the hospital. - Thought so. You're looking for the others? Like you. I haven't seen one of your kind in 16 years. Since the last purge. Yeah. I remember that night. I'll never forget it. The men from the town said they got every last one of them. But that isn't quite true, is it? Do you wanna know where your mother is? Gabe, you okay? I'm fine. Anymore of them bastards back there? - No, we got 'em all. Every last one of them. Your my special little berry. - What's going on? - We found Lawrence. And her dress by his body. I'm sorry, Anna. I really wanna understand. I'll be back. Goodnight, Roger. - Goodnight. - Before I got you, I had a dog. His name was Jasper, good dog. Always a bit of a rebel. But then, after the night I got you, Jasper got crazier, crazier. And then finally one day he snapped. So I had to send him to the better place. You know? I swore an oath, Anna, that I would kill the Wildlings. If I had been half the true hunter Jasper was, there would be no Anna, and Jasper would still be at my side. There's a better place for you. Lift up your shirt. Find the place, and put it in. Now push it in. Push it all the way in. 'Daddy? Why didn't you tell me that I'm a Wildling? - Only to spare you. - Why? Why did you spare me? - Anna was a mistake. And so is Daddy. Roger. - Good morning, Anna. Are you okay under there? C'mon, get up, I need to take you to the-- Anna. No. No. Anna? - Anna? - Drive. Anna, seriously. Can you go any quicker please? Where are we even going? - To the Northern Light. - Seriously? This is crazy, I mean, you're a fugitive. - No, I'm a Wildling. Why are you slowing down? Why are we stopping? - What is it? A Wildling? - Keep driving. - What is a Wildling, Anna? I wanna help you, but you can't honestly think, that we can just steal a cop car like this. They can trace this thing. , We should be down in about another five minutes, over. - Hey? Hey, VVildling? Ah, fuck, that's cold. You're gonna get sick in those wet clothes. HeY' C'mon, Anna, get "P- Raise your arms. - I won't bite you. - You track here down? Get the men. - I can't do that, Gabe. Not if she's with the kid. I ran into Cooper this morning. I'll tell ya, she's askin' too many questions. I'm not going to jail for this, Gabe. Not for your mistake-- - You let her get away. It's not that bad, really. - It won't stay like this. - What is it? - Run. 'What? Ray, stay down, stay down. I don't see them. - You gotta jump. - What? We follow the river. It's probably gonna take us back to the lake, from there, we can find our way back to the car and find Ellen. C'mon, let's go. Ellen. . RaY- Oh, my God. Who did this to you? No fucking idea. - Where's Anna? 'Gone. Over there. Let's head up this way. Flush her out. She's the lead suspect in the murder of fellow high school classmate, Lawrence Fuller. Fuller was found dead at a party three months ago, and his killer is still at large. Anna was arrested shortly after the murder, but escaped and is still missing several months into the investigation. An important warning, authorities are urging residents not to take matters into their own hands, as they fear this female suspect maybe dangerous. - Watch where you're going. I'm sorry. - We gotta go. Now. GO, 90, go' - Ray? - Ellen, Ellen, where are you? Rengreen, why? Listen, listen. They're on the move. And Roger's with them. She killed him. C'mon. Move, move. - Watch your step, sheriff. Put it down. Put it down. You shouldn't have been snooping around. And you should have never taken that girl. You were never gonna-- - This is 185 to dispatch. I need backup. COPY, Please. - We got a new little berry. It's almost ripe. Soon you'll be in the better place. It's okay. Alright, almost in post. Alright. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon, that's it. It's alright. That's it. I promise you, if it's a girl, I'll name it Anna.
