Hey, bro, I really do appreciate it though, man. You know, I wasn't really too sure about my next move. You know what I'm saying. Don't even worry about it. Besides, we're brothers, right? - Stay as long as you need. - I mean, yeah, right. I just don't wanna wear out my welcome. And plus, I promise, as soon as I can, I'm gonna move into my own spot. It's not even an issue. Like, we're just trying to make sure you're as comfortable as possible. Look, the only thing is, when we moved in, I guess the previous owner had a roach problem, or something, because that's all I spend my time doing now, is just killing roaches. You still scared of them damn roaches, huh? Who isn't? Give these roaches hell. About done? Yeah, I'm done. Hey, Yolanda, did my brother ever tell you how he got the name Ro? No, but I assume it's short for Ronald, right? Yeah, it is. But, that ain't why we call him Ro. Hey, man, don't tell that dumb ass story. When we was little kids, we grew up in a house similar to this one. Boy, it was infested. Be respectful, we let you stay here. No, no, no. I'm not saying your house infested, I'm saying we grew up in a house similar to it. Okay, I'm just messing with you. Yeah, I know. So, when we was little kids, Grandma used to make us go to bed at night, and I used to sprinkle bread crumbs in the bed with Ro. Why? To attract all those damn roaches, man. Man, he woke up, running, crying, screaming like a little girl. It was too damn funny. Man, Grandma whipped my ass that night, but I didn't care. It was all worth it. Aw, that's so mean. You could've given him a heart attack. Yeah, but it was still funny. And to this day, I still have nightmares about them damn roaches. I bet you do. All right. You know what? Thank you for telling that damn story again. Some of us have to get up and go to work tomorrow. All right, bro, like I said, I appreciate it, man. Glad you're here. Happy to be here. The bed has no sheets on it, the towels are on the dresser, okay? Good night. - You motherfucker. - Fuck that bitch! Man, shoot that nigga. - Oh, my God, are you okay? - Mm-hmm. What? My God, are you okay? Come on in, have a seat. Let me tend to those wounds, and I'll call a cab. Thanks for getting me cleaned up. You're welcome. I just came to get my girlfriend. I don't understand why those guys jumped me. All this way for love? Let me tell you a story. There was a young man just like you, and he was in trouble. The only difference is that he had a girlfriend, and they really needed money bad. But what he didn't know is that everything happens for a reason. For these reasons, you were brought here to me. Where's the money, old bitch? Money is materialistic. I don't handle material... Don't make me cut you. You don't wanna do this. - I - know you got some money around here somewhere. Cabs ain't free. Cabs ain't free, so don't make me cut you. I said, you don't wanna do this. What are, what are you doing? No! That's my husband's ashes! Thank you. Can I go see him? Just a second, Ronald. Let me make sure he's ready for you. He just called me out. Even so, I have to check. Sir, Ronald's here to see you. All right, he's ready for you. Come on in, Ronald. Hey, man, have a seat. Is everything okay, sir? Well, that depends, Ronald. On what, sir? Well, I'm gonna start off with the good then the bad. And you know, hopefully, at the end, it's good again. So, your productivity is where it should be. Good. Your attendance is outstanding. But, wow. Dude, Ronald, don't look so worried, man. This is about the promotion. Okay. Okay, so after reviewing all of the candidates, you're in the top three. Also good. But, I'm sorry, man, you didn't win. That's too bad. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I'm the senior, here. I don't take any personal time off. I don't take personal time. I haven't had a vacation in three years. Okay, calm down. I understand your disappointment, Ronald. But you know, shit happens. And this time, well, let's be honest. It happened to you. Who beat me out? It was Sheryl. Sheryl? Sheryl's only been here three weeks. Yeah, but in her defense, I mean, wow, she's very talented. I mean, come one, you know what I mean. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. My 10 years here doesn't mean shit because she sucked your dick. Wow, Ronald. Okay. I'm going to pretend you didn't say that. We've been friends a very long time. And you know, if it was up to me... Would you look at that. It was up to me. I'm sorry about that, man. I was counting on this promotion. I've sacrificed a lot of my personal life for this job. Okay. I'm willing to okay you for a two-week paid vacation, just to show you that I do respect your 10 years here. And keep in mind, I'm trying to find a happy ending here. Yeah, I say what I mean. Okay. Be happy, man. You've earned it. You know what? Go ahead and clock out now. I will see you back here in two weeks, okay? Oh, and Ronald? Go ahead and tell Sheryl to come in here, please. Thank you. Ro, wait! Ro! Shit, man. Oh, my God. Hey, young man. Hey, young man, that's my urn, there. I want it back. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hold on, ma'am. Hold up, hold up, hold up. What you talking about, what urn? That gold thing in there. Oh, this? Man, I just bought this from a dope head two nights ago, sucker. Somebody stole it from me. My husband's ashes are in there. Oh, so it's worth something to you. Yeah, that's all I have of him. Well, guys, I'm a nice guy, right? Yeah. Tell you what. - I bought it for $200. - Two hundred. I'll sell it back to you for $400. I don't have that kind of money. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back the fuck up, bitch. You got me fucked up. Stand back. - Give it back to her. - Who the fuck is he? I've got this under control. You want this urn real bad. Why don't you give it back to her, we can go on our way. And what? Man, get this motherfucker, dog. If I ever see your motherfuckin' ass again, you're dead. You hear me, motherfucker? You hear me? The police are on their way, and I remember faces. Bitch, ain't nobody worried about no motherfuckin' police. Let's roll out. My name is Mary Lou Parker, and this is gonna sting just a little bit. I warned you. So, what's your story? What are you talking about? I had everything under control until you came here. I was trying to help you. I'm not helpless. I've been here for over 30 years, and everything is just fine. I remember when you moved in about a month ago, and you saw me struggling with this trash, and you just didn't even help. I didn't figure you to be a help a old lady across the street type of person. So, what's really going on? I help when I can. You got your urn back, right? Yes, I did. Then you're welcome. Well, thank you. If you ever feel like talking, my door is always open. You gotta be fucking kidding me right now. - Ro, look. - No! I'm sorry you had to find out this way. We're so different. Different? What the fuck? That's my fucking brother, man. Ro, it wasn't even like that. Yeah, it was like that. No, it wasn't. It's been three months. - Three months. - Yeah. You been playing me for a fool for three months? Really, Eric? You're my fucking brother, man. I'm sorry. Sorry? Yeah, you are sorry, man. I never wanna see you again. Don't be here when I come back. Just a minute. Come in. You're eating dinner. I didn't mean to interrupt, I can come back. Don't be foolish. You can have dinner with me. I have a plate right there for you. I'm too angry to eat, thanks. What's troubling you? Is it a woman? Yeah. I have a sixth sense for this. My wife left me for my brother. I see. They've been having an affair for a couple months. I was the one that actually asked him to move in. How stupid is that? Don't be ashamed. There's always deception in time of war. I'm not at war. Yes, you are at war. War of the mind, war of the battlefield. It's always war. But in the true end, there's always losers, neither winners. But if you ever want growth, you must go to the battlefield. Are you some kind of fortune teller or something? Something. I only ask because when I moved in, word on the street was you're a witch. So I take it you don't like witches? Yeah, I do. I mean, the ones that are in pictures, with the long nose and pointy hats. I just never see them looking like they could bake cookies. Well, I do have some cookies on the stove, if you'd like some? No, no thank you. I'm good. No, you're not good. In fact, you wouldn't be here. You have rage, I can feel it. What if I can get your wife back? And all the things that you crave? How, with a spell, or something? Or something. It's just make believe, right? Just appease this old lady. Fuck it. You're right. It's not like any harm can come of it. Take my hand. Now what? At this time, and at this hour, I call upon the ancient powers of my fallen sisters. Bind our blood as one. I bind our fate as one. I say this spell, and I ask of thee, give us the powers to destroy our enemy, to claim the vengeance with harm to everyone that harms us. So mote it be. I'm sorry to everybody. We're so different. Man what we gone do today?. Get fucked up. You already fucked up. What do you wanna give me, then? All right. School boy, your bitch ass is done when I say you done. Paco. Yo, look here. Man, get the fuck out my face, bitch. Baby, do you need a Xanax? Bitch, you know I don't fuck with no shit like that. You need to. Whatever. Hey, yo, where's Big D at? Shit, I don't know. I ain't no damn babysitter. God, what the fuck? Yo, as a matter of fact, where that crack head that was supposed to be here? Shit, you tell me. He ain't here? Oh, man, what the fuck? Where the fuck you been? I been here, man. Yeah, where? Around, man. I been around. Nigga, where's my shit? I thought I paid you off, man. Man, that shit wasn't worth shit. Yeah, but the urn, that came from the old lady. It had to be worth a couple hundred. I'm gonna ask you this one more motherfucking time. Where the fuck is my shit? Hey, hey man. Look, look, man, there's other people. There's other old people I can clip, man. Who the fuck is that? Who the fuck are you? I'm your worst nightmare, motherfucker. Motherfucker! Shoot that bitch! Get over here. This is my partner Detective Banks. I'm gonna need you to give her a run down of your version of what happened to our goons over there. - I'm gonna work the guys. - Thanks, King. Good luck. Hi. What do you know about this? Are you paying me for this information? I'm trying to stop a killer, a killer, from doing this again. I'm protecting your neighborhood, where you live. So, you're not paying? No. It's your damn duty. I don't give a shit about duty. Good luck. Wait. Here. What do you know? Okay, so I was laying over there, and I saw these guys arguing with this dope head. Do you know his name? No, I've just seen him around. Really? But, I thought all you junkies knew each other? Do all black people look alike? - No. - Okay, then. Because he was a dope head and I'm a junkie? Crack was his thing, and heroine is mine. Okay. So, what did this dope head look like? He was about 5'10" and dark-skinned. Are you gonna let me finish? Go ahead. Okay. So, last night I was laying over there, and it seems like all the roaches in the city pass me up. All organized, like ants at a picnic, but by the thousands. And it looked like the street was moving. The thing is, it looked like the guy in the hood was controlling them. So, there was a guy in a hood, as well? - Mm-hmm. - Did you see his face? No, I kinda passed out. So you're telling me that the roaches, controlled by this guy in a hood, who you didn't see, killed these guys? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Okay, then we're done. Thank you. You know, just because I was high at the time don't mean I'm lying to you. Okay. What's up, partner? She give you anything good? Did she tell you what she saw? Yeah. Do you believe her? At first, no, but I do believe there are forces out there we can't quite explain. Hell. But was the info free? What do you think? No. Hello, I'm Detective Banks. By any chance, are you Ronald Brown? Yeah. Ronald Brown from Hastings High School? You really don't remember me. I'm Shane Banks. We went to middle and high school together? Look, I'm not trying to be rude, I just, I don't recall right now. It's okay. It's just amazing to see you after so many years. I just wish it was under better circumstances. Something happen, or something? I just need to ask you a few questions. Do you mind? Yeah, go ahead. Do you know these guys? Yeah, I know them. When was the last time you've seen them? I don't know, yesterday? Yesterday around what time? Ten? I can't really be certain. I know it was before noon. Well, I was told you had some sort of altercation. Can you tell me about that? Altercation wouldn't be my choice of words. Oh, really? Explain. This old woman, you know, they were giving her a hard time. So, I stepped in, they jumped me for it. I'm sorry. It just doesn't seem as though you've been jumped. I guess it wasn't as bad as I thought. Okay. Where were you around 12:00 A.M. to 3:00 A.M.? I really can't be certain, you know? I know I was with the old lady. Old lady? Do you mean Mary Lou Parker? Yeah. Well, I have some questions for her, as well, but I'm sure that your wife can verify the time you made it home? No. I mean, she's not here. She left. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. It's okay. Here's my number. If you remember anything, even if you don't. If you just wanna talk, give me a call. Besides, we can catch up. What the fuck did you do to me? Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. It's just, weird stuff is happening. Like what? For starters, I don't have that urge to kill roaches anymore. I'm not uneasy around them. I don't know, it's like, it's like... A connection? Yeah, something like... No. No! Now you understand what's going on. That was me. That was... That felt like me. So, you saw right through its eyes? You felt what it felt? How is that possible? If one has the right words, he opens up a world of possibilities. What did you do to me? I merely spoke words, and you gave me your blood. You wanted revenge just like I did. You tasted a bit. And how does it feel? What are you talking about? Those thugs? That wasn't me, I couldn't have done that. I didn't do that. You did, you can, and you will do it again. Every third night you will become what you loathe, and you will end those who hate us, and I will collect their souls like we always do. You're crazy! You're crazy! You have a blood covenant. You can run, but you can't hide from your destiny, Roach. Hey, what's up? Can I buy you a drink? No, I already have one. Why you so mad? I mean, can we be friends? You know, I mean, weed is a universal thing. It's got that loud pack too. You dig? Really? Let me help you out. Oh, shit. Yeah, now move around. Can I at least get my weed? Banks. What's up, girl? - King. - I knew I'd find you here. What's going on? I just wanted to let you know, one of my CI's who I used to kick around in Narco hit me up with a definite ID on our dope fiend. Now, according to her, his name was Gerald Nelson, and he lives over off Main, about a 20-minute drive from here. Now, word on the street is, he's naturally jumpy, but even more so due to recent occurrences. Now, if we're gonna catch this mutt before he squirt, we need to leave forthwith. Okay, let's do this now. Let me change my shirt first, okay? - Kevin? - I'm gonna drive. Take care of this. What the fuck is happening? This can't be fucking happening, man. I'm so hot. Nothing. Do you feel that heat? Yes. How are you doing this? We're one, and it's time. Time? You said, you said every third night. I lied. There's much work to be done. Shall we? We are one. Where my bag at, man, where my bag at? I'm gonna get some stuff, there's stuff here. One. What the hell is that, man? Oh, fuck! Shit! No! Freeze! Man, what the hell is this shit? We got a dead assailant upstairs, now we got a hooded guy with cockroaches. I'm not writing this one up. Not if you wanna keep your job. Where did he go? I don't know. He just disappeared. Say, Ro, you really need to clean this place up. I know you didn't come over here to talk about my housekeeping. No, I came to check on you, and to tell you I love you. And I'm sorry. Wow. Come on, Ro, we brothers. Look, I came to check on you, make sure you're okay. I'm not okay. I'm not okay with you fucking my wife. I'm far from okay. Come on, bro, I never meant for that to happen. I brought you in here because you didn't have a place to stay. And you fuck my wife. The only thing is, you didn't expect me to catch you. Come on, bro, tell me, how can I make this right? You can't. In fact, I don't even know if I can trust you anymore. So I think you better go, Eric, while you still can. Are you serious? Look, all things considered, and I know you don't believe me, I'm sorry. Hello? Shane? Hey, this is Ro, Ronald. No, no, no. No, everything is good. It's not good. I mean... You said if ever we weren't busy, you know, we could go out and do something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no. I know that place. I walk by there every day after work. That'd be great. Okay. Okay, great. I'll see you then. King, I must admit, he's really a nice guy. I mean, at least what I can remember of him in high school, he left a hell of an impression on me. But I just can't seem to shake the feeling that he has something to do with these murders. You know I'm the last one to step on anybody's gut feeling. I got $20 in my pocket right now that says that guy is not our perp. I hope you're right. I mean, he did leave a hell of an impression on me. Well, with that being said, I say we get out of here before he come out here and see you stalking him, and blow everything. You're probably right. While you're entertaining, I'm gonna shake some trees and see what I can find out on his brother, Eric. Oh, and the old woman down the street? I've been hearing a lot of stories on her, you know? So, see what you can dig up. Oh, top of the list already. Okay, well, let's go. Seems like I'm gonna have some company soon. Hey, Ro. Detective. Call me Shane. Okay, Shane. - You look nice. - Really? I was just on a stakeout in this. I really didn't have time to get dressed. When you called, you said you wanted to get out, and it sounded as though something was wrong. So, I just rushed over. Yeah, I hear you. Since my wife and my brother both ran away together. My stupid wife. You know, I was the one that actually invited him to stay with us. Stupid. You're not stupid. I wouldn't say stupid. Do you remember the time you first met me? In middle school? Middle school, that was high school, right? Actually, it was middle school. You know, kids can be so cruel, and I was the new kid. They found any and everything to pick on me about. It was so bad that I became used to it all. That was until you stepped in. You made them stop, just like that. I made a promise to myself that when I got to high school, that I wasn't gonna be the one getting picked on. So, I did any and everything it was to be accepted. That was, within reason. I remember that day when we were gonna cut school and go smoke some weed, and you just so happened to be in the hallway. You pulled me to the side. Do you remember what you said to me? Actually, yeah, I really do. But go ahead, I like the way you tell the story. Well, you said to me those girls are not going to amount to anything, that you're better than them, that you don't have to prove anything to anyone. Now go to class. You know, you changed my life with so many things. So, no, I don't think you're stupid. I think you're kind, and considerate, and you're a wise man. Nothing like your brother Eric. Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me, I have to take this. - It's work. - Yeah, go ahead. - Excuse me. - Hello. So, you think it's the grandson? I can't be 100%, but I do think the two are working in concert with each other. Matter of fact, I've already got the green light to do a tour tonight at the place. I'm sitting out here as we speak. Okay, King. Let's just say you're right about this whole date thing. I don't really know what to do. Hello, that's the easy part. When he tells a joke, you laugh. And when he leans in to kiss you, you let him. What if he doesn't? Then you lean in, and you make it do what it do, baby girl. Okay. So, what time do we meet up tomorrow to go to the jailhouse? I can't say. I'm gonna be out here all night, probably caught up watching the house. But, you hit me whenever you wake up in the morning, and we'll play it by ear, because I don't plan on rolling out of bed until late afternoon. And if you do what we talked about, you shouldn't be rolling out them sheets until at least evening time. Okay. Call me tomorrow, and be safe. Hey, sorry about that. It's okay, I understand. Just like that? Yeah. I mean, just like how? Like the perfect man. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm far from perfect. Well, I'm meaning the real, perfect male companion. Okay. Listen, I'm used to dealing with bad people, so I gotta know when they're lying. How do you do that? Simple. I use a few tricks. Like for example, you tell me that your wife left you. So, I wanted to know why. You could've been telling half truth, or just lying. But I know where you work, and I know where you live. So, I check hospital records, and your wife didn't leave you for a drug addiction. And you've been here at this bar for like 30 minutes now, and you haven't ordered one drink. So, you're not an alcoholic. But I drink, socially. But that's rather normal. So you're still the same guy that I knew so long ago. But the question is, why would a woman leave you? The answer, it's because she didn't know what she had. You're at the final stage. I'll handle it. You know, if you keep doing that, you'll go far in this company. I plan on it, baby. Mm, mm, mm. Aren't you glad you gave me that promotion? My frat brothers are not gonna believe this. We know, shit happens. And this time, it happened to you. Baby, did you say something? The nerve of this bitch. I'll handle it. How'd you? I see you moved on quickly. At least it wasn't while I was with you. What do you want? I just... Don't touch me. I just wanted to see how you were doing. You know how I'm doing. I'm doing more than you can imagine. I've walked the line of the unthinkable, and condemned the souls of those who have opposed me. What are you talking about? I'm talking about your future, bitch. What is wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me. I'm feeling better than I have been in a long time. I can't say the same for Eric. What's wrong with Eric? Tick tock. Tick tock. I have to go to work. It's cool, I get it. I don't understand. You don't have to say anything. I'm just saying last night was a mistake. It should've never happened, we should just move on. Last night wasn't the most romantic thing, but it's something that I will always remember. Forever. And I just wanted to say, can I come back by here when I get off of work? You wanna come back by here? Of course, Silly. Of course, I'm all right. Yeah, that nigga done went off the deep end. Come on, baby, look, just forget about all that. Okay. So, what time you coming home? All right, baby, I'll be waiting for you. Oh, hell, no. This ain't that type of party. I read your report about the roaches. Now, I'm just trying to piece some things together. After two months? God, 911 is a joke. Look, I'm just trying to understand some things. Now, will you tell me what really happened? You're not gonna believe me if I told you. Try me. Andre, my boyfriend, we had a lot of loss in our family. And that's what brought us together. And he came over one day with this crazy idea. He made me believe it, too. But, he mentioned a lot of weird things. Things that you would only see on TV. Things like what? Things like his mother and his father was killed, under suspicious, I don't know, circumstances. My brother was killed under these circumstances. And along with other people in the neighborhood, too. But they all had the same thing in common. Roaches and Mary Lou. What did Mary Lou have to do with this? Everything. She killed them all. And honestly, we was there to kill her. What your report says is you were there to rob her. The report is only half the truth. Me being a prostitute? Come on, now, I don't have no criminal background. I'm here because I choose to be here. I'm here because I'm safe here. Nobody's gonna believe me, but that old lady is something else. What do you mean, something else? She's the Devil. Okay. At first, you had my attention. But now, I know I'm listening to the ramblings of a crazy woman. Told you you wasn't gonna believe me. Yes. I do find it odd that you have no criminal background. But I did see that you're having a mental breakdown and you're on medication. So, I'll see if I can get the doctor to up your prescriptions, okay? Banks. You and King working that thug murder case, right? That's right. Where you at in that? Well, I just finished interviewing a possible lead, and I'm about ready to wrap things up. - Is that it right here? - Yeah. Let me see it. Hmm. Because the mayor's up my ass right now, and not in a good goddamn way. Damn election is coming up. As it stands right now, in this one district alone, there's been seven goddamn murders. I understand. Oh, you understand. Tell me, have you ever been a captain before? - No. - So don't tell me you fucking understand. And I noticed you've been saying I quite a bit lately, which leads me to my next question. Where the fuck is your goddamn partner? Well, I called him several times, and it's just going straight to voicemail. You know what? I gave him paperwork to stake out Mary Lou. You know what I got in return? Not a phone call, not an email, not a text, not a goddamn thing on my desk. I'll find him. You do that. What the fuck you waiting on? Goddamn. Motherfucking handcuffs is too tight, man. You hear me, man? These fucking handcuffs is too tight. You fucking listening, bro? - Straighten the fuck up. - All right. All right, man. All right. All right, girl, I'm at Eric's right now. I'm gonna hit you back when I know something. All right. Eric. Eric? Oh, my God! Oh, my God. She killed them all. And honestly, we was there to kill her. Are you okay, babe? It's Eric, he's dead. Dead? When? Just a little bit ago. I saw the whole thing. Here? At his house. I don't understand, baby. What happened? How? It was me. It was me, it was me. You killed your brother? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Hello. Eric Brown. I know the address. One thing, can you tell me about what time this happened? Are you sure? Okay, thank you. Look, Ro, get up. You have to tell me what really happened. Snap out of it. You have to tell me what really happened, Ro. It was that old woman. She cursed me. I was angry about not getting a promotion. I wanted revenge. When I caught Eric sleeping with my wife, she said she could make it all go away. She just needed a little bit of my blood. That's when weird things started happening. Things like what, Ro? The roaches. Then people started dying, Shane. Look, you have to snap out of it, okay? I know you can get out of these, but I'd rather you not, okay? Snap out of it. I have to make a run, baby, and I'll be right back. We can sort this things out, okay? You're fine right now. I'll be back, okay? So, do you believe me now? Yes, I do. Now, can you tell me how to stop Mary Lou? I mean, I can't take her to jail on what I've seen. No one will believe me. My boyfriend, Andre, and I, we study witchcraft and voodoo. All the things that normal people would laugh at. But you know what? There's truth to it all. We found out that Mary Lou's witchcraft is not a spell, it's a curse. A cursed pact with the Devil. She has to give six souls every month. Not just any old souls, somebody that she know. If it's a family member, even better. But what drives this curse is anger, and rage. Andre and I, we had a plan. You see, she's dying. So, she has to pass the curse on. But if she's dying, won't the curse have to die with her? No, the curse is like the myth of a werewolf. In seeing that she passed the curse to Andre, if we kill her, the curse would be lifted, and the two channelers would be free. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Channelers, two channelers? She needs two bodies. You know, bodies that are alive? Well, semi-alive. Anyway, she use their energy to see what other people can't see. She communicate with roaches. I was told that's the only reason why she need them, because she dying. So, you're telling me that she has two other people kidnapped right now? Pretty much. Fuck. So, the plan is for her grandson, Andre, to accept the curse. Once he accept the curse, I was to shoot Mary Lou in the head and kill Andre. I just couldn't do it. I didn't have the courage to. I love him so much. So I guess you have to kill Mary Lou and Andre. Well, why do I have to kill Andre? Have you heard anything I've said? If you don't, you gonna have six murders every month. But as of now, we have seven. A dope fiend, three thugs, a white man and his secretary, and now, Eric. What? Wait, wait a minute. So the curse didn't pass on to Andre? It passed to someone else. She passed it to someone else. How do you know? It's like what you cops call the ride along. She's spiritually training whoever she pass the curse on to. You gotta find him. The white guy, the secretary. Andre don't know them. And I've never heard of this Eric guy. Remember what I said, somebody that you know personally, intimately, or are seriously angry with. He was telling the truth. - What? - Nothing. Now, will you help me? You do understand you have to kill Mary Lou, and whoever the curse has passed on to? Warden, ATW, let's go. Roll door one. You know, I've been thinking. I think I should turn myself in. Look, you're not going to jail. No, I deserve to go to jail for... No, listen to me, Ro. Mary Lou, she played you. She gave you a curse, baby. Yeah, I know. But who's gonna believe me? I do. Listen, did you know she has two other people kidnapped? Right now? She's using their energy to communicate with roaches, and other weird stuff. Innocent people? Yes, baby. People that's not, they don't have nothing to do with your anger. You are innocent. She's using you. - She still will. - But I have a plan, baby. I have a plan to stop the curse. Just one thing. You have to die, baby. You have to die. That's all, huh? That's easy. No! Ro. It's not that easy. The old lady, she have to die first. And then, you'd have to die in order to complete the curse. No! I don't want you to die. I don't want anyone to die. Do you understand me, baby? I don't want you to die. It's okay, it's okay. I don't wanna lose you, either. Just like that time back in school when you were trying to skip, and I pulled you aside, and I told you what you needed to hear. If I had just met you one day earlier, or you had met me one day earlier, you could've pulled me aside and told me what I needed to hear. What's your plan? Listen, we have to reconsider this, all right? She sees everything. I bet that bitch won't see this coming. It shall be done on Earth as it is in Hell. You're with him? You're supposed to be helping me. Silence, child. Take her. He's with me, now. Ro, thank you for bringing me to her. You've gotta do something quick. I'm starting to lose control. Of course you're losing control. The ritual is almost complete. Shane, you are the smart one. I give you that. Like everyone else, you're always falling short. But it's true. You believe that I'm looking for anger. But that mistake has been made over and over again. But you know, I can control you, through anger. But controlling you is not my driving force. Passing the curse on is not my driving force. Ro is just merely a vessel I use to bring the purest of souls. And you're that soul, dear. And yes, I am dying. I mean, my body is dying. And I will open my eyes again in your body. With Ro by my side as enforcer. This is how it always been, and this is how it always will be forever. Thou shall be done. On Earth as it is in Hell. Shane. Got you, bitch. Let me go. Shane. Oh, my God, Andre, I'm so happy to see you. It's over. What the fuck just happened? How the hell did we get here? It's a long story, King. Ms. Banks? The doctor is ready for you now.
