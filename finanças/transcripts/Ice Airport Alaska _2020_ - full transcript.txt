(suspenseful orchestral music) Narrator: This time, winter is coming to alaska. A cargo plane has a $12-million maintenance emergency. Levitti: Taking the engine off is definitely One of the top five most dangerous jobs in aviation. (siren wailing) Narrator: A gunman in the terminal-- Becker: This way. Narrator: Puts police officers in the firing line. Hoffman: A worst case, he shoots himself or shoots one of us. Narrator: And winter's first snowstorm strikes. Harris: My litmus test is if it's not safe enough For my family to land on it, Then it's not safe enough for anybody to land on. And that's the bottom line. (soft rock music) Narrator: Ted stevens international airport In america's last frontier. Harris: We live in alaska. The expectation is that we should be able to function Regardless of what the weather is. Narrator: Hammered by sub-zero temperatures And arctic storms-- Man: Temperature is what's gonna kill you. Narrator: It takes a major league team of workers-- Man: In aviation, there's no second chances. Levitti: Anything could go wrong in a split second. Angelopoulos: Ho, ho, ho, ho! Everybody stop! Narrator: To keep the airport open no matter what. Man: We're the gateway to asia. They're counting on us to be open. Narrator: The fifth-busiest cargo hub on the planet. Man: Transporting the weirdest cargo in the world Is just another day in anchorage. Narrator: Welcoming millions of passengers every year. Officer: Dispatch, 205, I'm breaking. What's the exact address? Woman: We have to be 100% certain 100% of the time. Narrator: This is ice airport alaska. (helicopter blades whirring) Alaska, america's most northern state And its largest at over twice the size of texas. It's also the coldest, wildest state in the us. It's home to bears, moose, and thousands of birds. They're a major risk to aviation, So the airport has a dedicated wildlife management team. Nelsen: My job is to coordinate the effort To keep the wildlife and the planes From running into each other. Narrator: Us department of agriculture biologist Spencer nelsen heads the crew. Nelsen: I grew up in nebraska. I saw this position open about seven years ago And I liked the challenges that it presented. There's very few wildlife biologists in the world That do a job every day that you know saves people's lives. Narrator: The last frontier has challenges Spencer wasn't prepared for. Nelsen: When I came here, I had to relearn How to do the entire job. It's just a really unique environment. Nothing you learn in the lower 48 applies here. Narrator: It's late October, A peak time for wildlife activity Before winter's big freeze. Nelsen: Our change here from fall to winter is pretty abrupt. Narrator: The first target for spencer's daily patrol Is alaska's largest predator. Nelsen: There's black bears here and there's brown bears here. They hibernate here. They raise their young here. We wanna get a good handle On what the bears are doing right now. Narrator: In the fall, hungry bears Desperate to fatten up for winter Are drawn to the airport by the smell of food. Nelsen: Last week, I think we had two reports Of black bears on airport property. We've had situations where we've had to close All three runways on the main airport here Within a half an hour Because we've had as many as two bears On the airfield at one time. Just really nerve-wracking (laughing) for everybody. Narrator: Hungry bears will dig Under the airport's 13-mile perimeter fence to get in. Spencer has to find any breaches before winter comes. Nelsen: We won't be able to see them Because the snow'll be up against the fence And they'll be undetectable. So, we gotta find 'em now before it snows And fix 'em now before it gets frozen. The runway is just right through the woods And down the hill here. I can just about guarantee you We're within 200 yards of a black bear right now And they probably know we're here too. Okay, here's one here. This would be a place that a bear's dug. And I see some freshly disturbed dirt here. This looks like something came through last night. This extra bit of fence will fix this. (hammering) This wasn't part of our wildlife degree, But I wanted to get a job Where I'd get my boots dirty every day. I'm happy with that; that's really good. This'll force them to find another spot And, you know, then we'll fix those too. We just keep at it and so do the bears, I guess. Narrator: Spencer can't rest for a moment. Winter's onset means hundreds of migrating birds Are flocking around the main terminal. Nelsen: We get reports of around 20 to 25 bird strikes a year. They can crack a wing, they can even destroy an engine. And worst-case scenario, We'd expect to see a human fatality. Narrator: Of all deaths Caused by bird strikes in the us, Over 10% happen in alaska. Nelsen: Right here in the anchorage area We've had catastrophic accidents Where human lives were lost. Narrator: These birds are migrating From the arctic to africa. They've stopped on lake hood in the center of ted stevens, A lake which is also the world's busiest floatplane base. Nelsen: Behind us is the international airport, And we can't have a body of water this close to that airport And not do something about the birds that are on this lake. Narrator: To spencer, a duck can be Just as dangerous as a bear. Nelsen: Got a group of diving ducks out there. These are the ducks that we don't want In the airport environment. See if we can convince 'em to continue migrating south. (suspenseful orchestral music) Narrator: Spencer is here to spoil the party. Nelsen: So, what I'm gonna do is fire a cracker shell out there, Going to explode out over the water near the ducks And scare 'em away, I hope. (gun firing) (ducks quacking) Oh. The flock is up off the water and moving away. Good. Narrator: Spencer spends a third of his time in the fall Making the air space bird-free. (shot whistling) But very soon, alaska's extreme weather Will do the job for him. Nelsen: Within two weeks, This is gonna be a different environment. The lake's gonna be froze, the ducks are gonna be gone, We could have a foot or two of snow around, And it's gonna be winter. It comes fast. (shot whistling) (indistinct radio chatter) (soft acoustic guitar music) Narrator: The airport is bracing for winter's first snow. For now, the sun's shining, but it's only 20 degrees. But cold is no excuse in alaska. A time-critical international cargo aircraft Has just touched down. It must refuel and fly again as soon as possible Or risk losing money and customers. Polar air is anchorage's largest freight carrier. Station manager mike spillane Is unloading this 747's cargo for urgent transfer south. Spillane: We had quite a bit of express Material on this aircraft. The express product has got to be priority To get into cincinnati hub as early as possible. We try to get ahead of the game, Get the airplanes back in the air, 'cause they don't make any money sitting on the ground. Narrator: The express cargo is due in cincinnati In the next 24 hours. But this aircraft is grounded. One of its engines has a reported fault. Hulsey: Push this way. There you go. Corley: It came in with a oil leak, So therefore we have to change the engine here. Narrator: Every hour the plane isn't moving cargo Costs an estimated $36,000. Hulsey: Yeah, we're gonna have to-- Narrator: Lead technician jarrett corley Has the enormous task of replacing The six-ton, $12-million engine. Corley: It all plays on me. Everybody's looking at me. It's critical. Hulsey: There you go, come on. Come on now. Narrator: As usual, alaska's weather Adds to the challenge. It's already below freezing, And that's the high for the day. Corley: It's not easy job in warm weather, And tonight it's supposed to get down to 16. Narrator: But jarrett has a $300,000 weapon To fight the elements. Hulsey: I think we'll push it with the poles and drag it back? Narrator: An inflatable tent. Corley: So, we used to have to just work out here in the cold. You work five or 10 minutes Then you warm up for five or 10 minutes. So, this here worked real well. You stay warm, safe. Looks good to me. (energetic banjo music) So, this is a fuel rail here. And inside, there's a little gasket. And if it leaks, it's the engine change. There's no fix for it. Be a gasket, which would cost $20 or $30 Versus an engine change that's $20 or $30 million. We have a timeline for this to be done, which is 12 hours, But it has to be done safe. People's lives are in danger. It's not a tractor. You can't pull over and work on it. Narrator: A 12 -hour delay could cost Up to half a million dollars. Polar's reputation and bottom line will suffer If this plane's not fixed quickly. Corley: We can start installing it, The eec, the oil change, inside. Narrator: But it's not a straight old-for-new swap. They need to transfer some parts of the old engine To the multimillion -dollar replacement Waiting in the workshop. Corley: This is the new engine that we're gonna have going on. It's just the block, if you will. The base motor. Narrator: First, they have to attach The old tailpipe exhaust system made of nickel alloy. It's designed to withstand 50,000 pounds of thrust And 1,000-degree temperatures. Hulsey: Hey, lb, can you come out and help us? Narrator: Ex-naval air force engineer sean hulsey Is overseeing the installation. Hulsey: And if they were not connected proper, They would not cool the tailpipe area properly And it would allow a burn-through And the engine begins to melt itself, And it happens very quickly. Narrator: A dent or crack In this precision-engineered exhaust would ruin it. With no spare for 500 miles, It could be a million -dollar delay, So sean is taking no chances. Hulsey: Come on, jarrett, you're looking good. Corley: It's too much. Hulsey: You got six inches over here on my side. Corley: Okay, whoa, stop. Hulsey: So, we could lower this. (metal clanging) ho, hold on, ho. (suspenseful orchestral music) Narrator: Anchorage's air traffic control tower Is in communication with an american airlines 777 En route from la to shanghai. Police sergeant skupnik Is responding to the emergency call. Skupnik: The only information we've got On the patient right now Is that it was some type of cardiac event. Anything dealing with cardiac is always unstable. Narrator: Only five hours into the 14-hour journey And with 4,300 miles of pacific ocean still to cross, Ted stevens is their last airport For an emergency landing on us soil. Skupnik: The passenger has chest pains, And that is very, very serious. We could be walking on that plane And have a passenger do cpr Or we'd better jump in and do the same. (sirens wailing) Narrator: The anchorage fire department's medics Also race to the runway. Skupnik: Plane's due in about 10 minutes or so. Hoping afd gets here within that time period. They've got the als gear, the advanced life support gear. The uniqueness of anchorage airport here in alaska, We're right on a lot of the international flight paths, So it's fairly common that we get A lot of the medical aircraft that come in. Narrator: Cardiac arrest is responsible For 86% of inflight deaths. If the passenger's condition has deteriorated Since they declared an emergency landing, He may need resuscitation at the airport. Skupnik: You got any update on the passenger? Flight crew: Not yet. Skupnik: Okay. Narrator: Until they reach the patient And assess his vitals, The team has to prepare for the worst. Skupnik: Lewis, what's the status? Lewis: They're getting the wheelchair. Narrator: The patient is semi-conscious. He still needs urgent medical attention. Skupnik: It's a chinese national. He is traveling alone, so there's no family or anything That's gonna be coming off. You guys get him off to safety. (siren wailing) Narrator: The patient heads to anchorage hospital. In just 60 minutes, the ground team has the flight And its 200 passengers back in the air. (air traffic control chatter) Narrator: Ted stevens' place on the flight path Means it's not only people that need to land For the sake of their health. Aioletuna: Turn it on? Man: No. Aioletuna: Oh, okay. Narrator: Ground handling supervisor maia aioletuna-- Aioletuna: Good morning! Narrator: Is expecting a special arrival. Aioletuna: And our next flight will be the pig charter. (laughing) We see those often. Narrator: The pigs are flying from chicago to china And need a breather before heading on. Aioletuna: On board right now is over 1,100 pig. They've traveled from chicago, so they need some fresh air. George, go up and open the main deck door, please. Narrator: Maia opens every cargo bay To make sure the pigs get a big whiff of alaska. Aioletuna: I can see the piggies, it's exciting. I can smell them too now. (laughing) Woo, it is kind of warm up here. Narrator: To guarantee the pigs a blast of cold air, Maia has to open the plane's nosecone. And after 20 minutes cooling off, she can get a closer look. Aioletuna: Hi! They're beautiful. Eating good. (laughing) Narrator: Refueled and refreshed, The pigs' alaskan adventure is over. Aioletuna: Piggies are ready to leave. (laughing) They had their time here in anchorage. Ready! And there goes the piggies. (laughing) 'til next time! Pigs do fly, I guess. (laughing) Radio: Asia air 31, Runway seven left at romeo, clear for take off. Narrator: Late mornings in the fall are dark in alaska. Overnight, almost a foot of snow has covered the airport; Not good for incoming aircraft. As the air traffic controllers Begin their eight-hour shift, they face a potential crisis. Beargie: So, after this first heavy snowfall of the year, We're expecting some more snow, Which could have a really big impact on our operation. Narrator: The 10 -person day shift, Led by patrick beargie, faces a huge test: Landing 50 planes in the next two hours Through the challenging conditions. Beargie: Oh, can you let me know when foothills taxis out? Man: Yeah. Beargie: Thanks. Narrator: And there's worse to come. A new storm is on the horizon. Beargie: Currently, our weather has been deteriorating. After 9 a.M., it'll probably change to freezing rain. It accumulates on the runway as water And can potentially freeze. Very dangerous for aircraft. Narrator: Iced runways would shut the entire airport, Force the planes to divert hundreds of miles, And cost ted stevens millions of dollars in lost revenue. Beargie: It's very critical that we have the runways open And available for the teams. Narrator: Patrick alerts every airport department To the incoming storm. Beargie: It's anchorage tower. The weather radar is showing freezing rain occurring Until about 3 o'clock today. Knox: Okay, tower, thank you very much. Narrator: But the responsibility Of keeping the runways safe falls squarely on the shoulders Of the airfield maintenance team. Knox: Okay, everybody. Could be icy conditions this morning, So we gotta be ready for freezing rain. Narrator: 110 men and women work 24/7 To keep the 33 million square feet of active runway Clear of the six million tons of snow which fall every year. (suspenseful orchestral music) Today, brendon knox, the airfield maintenance foreman, Has a huge task in front of him if he's going to keep The world's fifth -busiest cargo hub open. Knox: We had about eight inches during the night last night, So pretty significant snowfall for anchorage. It is quite a bit to handle at the start of the season. Narrator: Brendon has 20 years' experience With alaska's worst weather And $100 million worth of Specialized equipment to call on: Plows, snow blowers, and deicers, Whatever it takes to keep alaska flying And ted stevens open for business. In 70 years, the airport has never closed for weather. Knox: We're real proud of the record we have here at anchorage Of keeping the airport open And especially not closing for snow. Narrator: Before brendon can set his crew to work, He needs to see just how icy the runway is. Knox: Braking action for the aircraft becomes poor And there's always the potential Of the aircraft sliding off the end of the runway. Yeah, it's pretty serious. Narrator: Since 2000, over 400 deaths worldwide Were caused by planes skidding off runways. Brendon knows the lives of thousands of passengers Are in his hands. Knox: We're gonna head to do a friction test And see what the condition of those surfaces are. We have certain criteria that we have to meet for braking And if we're not meeting that, we have to close the runway. Narrator: Sensors on brendon's truck Check every aspect of the surface conditions. Knox: Ground temperature's gone down a degree or two. The snow's gonna be sticking From here on out probably today. Narrator: The most critical is surface friction. Brendon's computer measures the braking distance On a scale of one to a hundred. Knox: Anything 40 and above is gonna be good braking. Below that, we'd have to close the surface. It would be kept closed until it was treated To get that braking action back to a safe level. Narrator: Any reading below 40 Means the runway is dangerously icy and not safe to land on. Knox: I'm gonna brake. Well, that's about a 33 right there. Hang on a second. The first one-third up here is, it's a little, It's a little, I guess I'd call it greasy. If we get caught and ice does form, We'll have to close the airport. Narrator: Alaska's biggest cargo carrier, polar air, Has grounded one of its 17 747s Midway on its journey from asia to cincinnati. It needs a complete engine change, But the delay costs the company $600 Every minute it's on the ground. Hulsey: Come on, jarrett, you're looking good. Come on, keep coming. Narrator: Former navy engineer sean hulsey Is leading the charge to get the new engine ready. Hulsey: One of the reasons I picked Aircraft maintenance engineering Was because we meet different people And this job is so totally dynamically different Every time, every day. Man: Very slow. Narrator: It's the only spare engine onsite. Damaging I could be a multimillion-dollar mistake. Hulsey: Right there, that's it, it's in. I got 12 o'clock, I got 6 o'clock. Narrator: The sleeve is attached with 60 bolts, But that's 60 opportunities for error. Hulsey: This single bolt can get loose inside of the engine. It can cause a complete catastrophic internal failure Of the engine. How many you got in there, jim? Jim: I have two. (bolt clanging) Narrator: Sean's dropped a bolt. If he can't retrieve it, he could have to scrap the engine. Hulsey: Damn, need my flashlight. Man: Good news, bad news? Hulsey: It's right under here. Right there. Narrator: Luckily, it's just in reach. Hulsey: Here you go. I always get the easy stuff. (laughing) Narrator: Sean's first job is done. The new engine is ready. But back outside, they still have to detach The old engine from the wing. That's the hard part. Levitti: Taking the engine off is definitely One of the top five most dangerous jobs in aviation. Takes a lot of strength, a lot of endurance. It's a huge team effort And you could easily hurt each other. Narrator: Trent levitti and nik angelopoulos Must work with the whole team To lower the six -ton engine safely. Levitti: That's gonna be muffled. We gotta speak to each other through the engine. Angelopoulos: Which one are you taking? Levitti: I'm taking this one. Angelopoulos: All right. Guys in the back, go up even. Levitti: Try to match each other's movements. Anything could go wrong in a split second. If we mess up enough, it could cost a lotta money. Angelopoulos: Okay, hold off on the front, inboard! Outboard, go on up. Angelopoulos: In the back, keep going up! Hulsey: If the points are not hoisted In a symmetrical, evenly-loaded manner, The whole engine can twist like a pretzel. Levitti: Slowly on the back though. Slowly on the back. Angelopoulos: Ho, ho, ho, ho! Knox: Okay, everybody, it's 28 degrees right now. We gotta be ready for freezing rain this morning. Narrator: Airfield maintenance foreman brendon knox Is battling winter's first storm. It's only the beginning of a long brutal season. From here on in the job will only get tougher. Knox: If we get caught and ice does form on the runways, We have to close the airport. There's always a danger of an aircraft Sliding off the runway. Any loss of traction would be pretty devastating For an aircraft. Narrator: Also out on the runway Is eagle-eyed scott harris from the airport operations team. Harris: Bad day for me at work would mean Somebody lost their life Or we had a aircraft accident or an incident. Narrator: A 20-year air force veteran, Scott won't hesitate to shut down all three runways If he doesn't like what he sees. Harris: I'm just gonna make sure that this is safe To operate and land on. My litmus test is if it's not safe enough For my family to land on it, Then it's not safe enough for anybody to land on it, And that's the bottom line. Narrator: The runways are safe for the moment. But on the horizon there's a storm brewing. Harris: I can look out right now and see how it's all grayed up And the ceilings are low. We could get this watery ice mix That could freeze on the runway. Our worst-case scenario right now Is I gotta close this runway. Narrator: The most lethal weather The airport can face is freezing rain. Knox: The blue is snow, the green is rain. You have to monitor it continuously When we get into a freezing rain. Narrator: When the air temperature is above freezing But the ground temperature is below, A sheet of ice can cover the runway in seconds. Brendon and scott must decide How to protect the airport against the weather. Harris: Hey, brendon, so what do you think? Knox: I think we should put some anti-ice on it real quick. Treat it now, then I'll be safe. Harris: Okay. Knox: So, I think I'll get two of 'em, we'll make a one-way pass and be done. Harris: Sounds good to me. Narrator: Deploying the million-dollar fleet of deicers Is a preemptive measure to keep the airport open. But the conditions don't only pose a threat to aircraft. Harris: That's the tsa. Oh, yeah. Narrator: The slick ice has caused a two-ton road block On a route for brendon's deicers: A tsa agent's truck. Harris: This vehicle is holding up traffic. Let me see if I can call one of these other guys And see if they can help you out. Hey, harry, it's scott in airport operations. I need your help. The watch commander's gonna send One of his crew over here with a vehicle. We're gonna try to hitch the back of this And just get her going and pull her outta there. Narrator: Getting stuck in the snow Is a rite of passage in alaska. (shivering) Harris: The guys are gonna pull it back out. And once we get some traction, We'll drive forward and she'll be on her way. Ay. Yeah! Oh yes, baby! Man: There you go. Harris: Good sir, I appreciate it, man. Narrator: With the truck now freed, The access road is clear for traffic, But the nightmare weather scenario has begun. Brendon's team must race to the runway. Knox: Yeah, we're getting some rain here now, So we're gonna go ahead and treat that runway at this point. Narrator: 25 aircraft are due to arrive in the next hour. In current conditions, they can't safely land. Knox: You guys go ahead and get your wings deployed So we're ready to spray. Just gotta hurry up here 'cause there's aircraft coming. It's gonna be pretty fast. Narrator: The aircraft waiting to land Can only be held for so long before they need to divert. Brendon throws everything he's got at the icy runway. Knox: Let's put that down full strength instead. It's already starting to do something here. Narrator: They blast 3,000 gallons of deicer Costing $16,000 onto the two miles of runway. But with planes waiting in the sky, They're not moving fast enough for air traffic control. Knox: Maintenance one and company. Yeah, we'll, we've got kind of a speed limit With these trucks; we'll go as best we can here. Radio: Roger. Knox: The tower was asking us to expedite, But the deicer trucks that we use We have to run at about 18 miles an hour or less. You can only drive this fast. We're doing the best we can. (rock music) Narrator: 12 minutes later, brendon's done all he can. Knox: Tower, maintenance one and company Are clear, thanks. Narrator: Air traffic control gives the first plane Clearance to land. Harris: We've got an aircraft on final right now. We got another one on final behind him Coming through this weather. So, the worst-case scenario when aircraft lands, It is unable to stop and tracks and slides off the runway. That's not something we want. Narrator: Until the plane touches down, They can't be sure how well the deicer has worked. Harris: He just landed right there. I saw a little bit of moisture coming up, So we know the runway's wet because of the local deicing, So that tells me our deicing is working well. Narrator: But the pilots will have the final say. Harris: Again, our maintenance guys have done an excellent job And our aircraft were landing just fine. Narrator: The team has passed the winter's first test. But it's only the beginning. Before the season's over, There'll be countless more battles against the elements. Knox: We've actually had now a snow event under our belt, So I think we're pretty much ready to go here. Angelopoulos: Hold it, everybody! Don't load up the dynos yet! Narrator: It's midnight. Polar air has a 747 cargo plane grounded. Crews are racing to change its faulty engine, But time and money are against them. Levitti: Back's down completely. We need to start going up in the back. Narrator: The price of delays Will run into the thousands of dollars, But rushing and damaging the aircraft could cost millions. Angelopoulos: Hold off in the front, inboard! Outboard, go on up! Narrator: The new engine is ready to go. Now, they have to get the old one off the wing. Angelopoulos: That's pretty good. That's excellent. Narrator: Removing the engine is risky. It weighs six tons and costs $12 million. Hulsey: It's not something that you cut corners on. Too much money, it's too much weight, There's too many lives standing around. Narrator: The team has to position A steel frame around the engine to catch its enormous weight When it's released from the wing. It's attached by four pins. Angelopoulos: I want an inch of gap, inch of a gap. Levitti: Hold on, hold on. Let me, I got this. Let me, let me do this. Narrator: The crew must slot the four pins from the frame Into the engine to hold it steady. Angelopoulos: We're not there yet. It has to be lined up perfect to pick up the weight. Okay, hold it in the back! Front only, come on down! Narrator: They're achingly close. But in aviation, close isn't good enough. Angelopoulos: Keep going, keep going. We're there. Man: I got the pin in! Angelopoulos: Your pin? Your pin? Levitti: Everybody's, everybody's in. Narrator: With all four pins secured, What goes up must now come down, safely. Angelopoulos: All four at the same time! Corley: This is the most dangerous portion of it As far as somebody being able to get hurt. Angelopoulos: Hold it, hold it, hold it! Are you lined up? Levitti: It's fine. Narrator: The crew must control the engine Every inch of its journey down into the frame. Levitti: Watch that seal, make sure nothing catches. Angelopoulos: Okay, aft come on down! Keep going, everybody down! You're in the guides! The engine is down. Hulsey: Best news all day! Narrator: But with the old engine on the ground, They're still only halfway there. Levitti: What's next is the new engine, Which is actually gonna be more valuable Because it's the one that's going into service. That's the most tricky part of this engine change. Things can go wrong any point of the way. Radio: Runway 33, clear for takeoff, Cathay 20. (indistinct radio chatter) Narrator: Five million passengers Travel through ted stevens international airport each year, But not everyone is a model citizen. Officer: Hey, what's your name? Man: (bleep) you. Narrator: So, there's a thin blue line Upholding law and order in the terminals. Officer: Dispatch, 205, I'm breaking. What's the exact address? Narrator: The airport police Have 58 highly-trained officers Ready to put themselves in harm's way 24/7. (suspenseful orchestral music) It's midnight. Police officer hoffman is preparing for his night shift When he gets an urgent call. Hoffman: We gotta go. (siren wailing) We have a report of a potentially suicidal subject And he's got two handguns in shoulder holsters, So we are en route right now trying to locate him. Worst case, he shoots himself or shoots one of us. I don't want anybody to die. Narrator: The anchorage police have reported That an armed man has entered the airport. An active shooter in the terminal Is every officer's worst nightmare. Hoffman: Anchorage police department reportedly gotten Suicidal messages from an individual. Apd told us that his cell phone pinged And they used a gps locator system To tell the nearest location. This individual's device has just pinged by the terminal By our ravn alaska gates. Well, it's extremely dangerous situation. We don't know if he aims to shoot other people Before he shoots himself. We have to treat it absolutely serious. It's the kinda call that you pray never happens to you As a police officer, but it's the kind of call That you pray you're ready for when it does. Narrator: Every officer on duty Has been called to the south terminal, The gunman's last known location. Hoffman: So, what's going on? Becker: All right, so apd, they pinged his phone And it pinged on international Near the a gates. Hoffman: Copy. Narrator: Out of the 14,000 faces Traveling through the airport, The police officers are looking for just one, Who could shoot at any moment. Hoffman: We've got thousands of people at this airport. If there's somebody there with guns, Suicidal, we don't know what he's gonna do, We have to find him now. Narrator: The manhunt begins. Hoffman: We're gonna go mobile And make sure he's not outside the airport too. According to the report, He's got a black carhartt jacket on. We've been told he's over six foot tall, 180 pounds. Narrator: Officer hoffman must scour every inch Of the six-mile airport perimeter. Hoffman: Our airport is huge. Thousands of cars are parked here And we don't know if he's hiding in one of 'em. He could jump the fence and access passenger aircraft. We don't know where he is. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. (suspenseful orchestral music) (siren wailing) Narrator: It's a quarter past midnight And officer hoffman and the entire airport police department Are responding to their most serious call this year: A suicidal gunman in the airport. Hoffman: So, this suspect is reported to have Two semi-automatic handguns, twin shoulder holsters. That's a lot of firepower for one guy In a terminal full of people. Narrator: The frantic search to catch him Has now spread to a six-mile area around the airport. Hoffman: This is a very serious situation. He said he was armed, he said it was suicide. Those are huge red flags. Narrator: The only clue to his whereabouts Is his cell phone. Hoffman: The gps is only pinging every 15 minutes, And that's a lotta ground he could cover in that time. Narrator: While officer hoffman Scours the airport perimeter, Officer becker continues the manhunt inside the terminal. Becker: The last known location was basically right out here, Right at door eight area. Narrator: The police are armed with glock 9mm pistols, But the gunman has twice the firepower. Becker: We do not know what kind of semi-automatics they are, How many rounds they hold, So we don't know if these guns are stolen Or he coulda just bought 'em today. Our main concern would be his safety And the safety of the traveling public. Hold on a sec. Okay. We gotta go. 206 copies, we're mobile. Narrator: On the radio, officer becker gets an update On the latest gps location. The gunman's outside the airport perimeter. Hoffman: 209 copies, I'll check it out. We're pretty close to that area now. We're gonna go check out the vicinity And see if we can find either the suspect on foot Or in a vehicle. Narrator: The gunman's last known location Is a parking lot on the far side of the airport. Hoffman: A lot of cargo companies are over here. A lot of vehicles. There's a lotta places for people to hide. Camera down. Narrator: To check every possible hiding place, Officer hoffman must leave the safety of his vehicle. Hoffman: So, this area's clear, And we are really scouring this area. Narrator: The police have now been searching For over 30 minutes. Officer hoffman checks in for an update On the gunman's gps signal. 209. Narrator: Officer hoffman can stand down. Hoffman: That's about as good an outcome as we could hope for. And it's a relief Because nobody had to pull a trigger tonight. Narrator: It's 5 a.M. And the crews at polar air cargo Are on the home stretch of a marathon engine swap. Hulsey: One bolt in and everybody hold! Narrator: The old engine is off And the new $12-million replacement is almost ready. Hulsey: We need a bolt in one place! Narrator: The one-ton nose cowl Is the last piece of the puzzle. Hulsey: This whole area around the engine right here Is a super critical area on the airframe. Has to stay smooth. It can't be dented. No mistakes at all. Everybody can push up. Use your manpower and that, there you go. I got one at 12 o'clock. Got a hard point at 12 o'clock. We're good. Man: It's up and mounted, so now I'm happy. Rock and roll. Narrator: With the nose cowl on, They can hoist the new engine onto the wing. Angelopoulos: Hold it, right there! All four, go on up! Narrator: They have to be perfectly synchronized To keep seven tons of engine safely suspended in the air. Levitti: It's not just damaging the engine, It's people getting hurt. This is a heavy job. Careful! Narrator: If the engine hits the wing And damages the plane's structure, it's game over. Angelopoulos: You have to be precise. You damage the pylon, Then boeing has to come out with a repair. Very expensive. Levitti: Inboard, slow down a little bit. Angelopoulos: You're watching that seal, right? Levitti: You'll go faster than he will. Narrator: The engine is now just fractions of an inch From lining up to its bolt points On the underside of the wing. Angelopoulos: Hold up on that side. You keep going up. Levitti: All right, go up, keep going up a little bit. (shouting) There you go, come on. Come on, there you go! We've pinned both sides. Narrator: Attaching the engine requires bolts Made of a specially -designed steel alloy Engineered to take the force Of a jet engine at full throttle. Angelopoulos: The entire weight of the engine Will be relying on those bolts. These are very expensive. As you torque the bolt, it stretches. The metals that are used in it maintain the strength. Man: The next step will be to torque 'em down. Man: It's in, it's in. Woo! (laughing) Narrator: After over 200 man-hours Spent replacing $30 million worth of precious engineering, This 747 is ready to safely get back into the sky. Levitti: I mean, it's been fun, it's been challenging. I always like a challenge. That's what we're here for. But I'm ready for bed, that's what I'm ready for. (soft orchestral music)
