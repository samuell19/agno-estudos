MUSIC THUNDER Dennis didn't die, he escaped. Dennis Hopper and the gas mask, Dennis Hopper painting, Dennis Hopper writing, Dennis Hopper taking pictures, and Dennis Hopper doing just about anything. All on the run, one way or another. I miss you always, my brother. My friend. You rest in peace in the hands of the almighty God. MUSIC I can play a feeling of Dennis... right? Dennis feeling was all like this SUBTLE GUITAR MUSIC you can't really hear with this one you know what I mean, it's like... the big... GUITAR MUSIC MUSIC He was ready to go, man. He was like You know what, I'm ready, that's it. MUSIC He was a great witness and participant in a lot of important moments in American history. ROCK MUSIC He had something dangerous about him that's made him very interesting to me. ROCK MUSIC He would have rather died than not live the way he lived. ROCK MUSIC He was an Uneasy Rider, yeah. He was an Easy Rider... he was an uneasy Easy Rider. LAUGH An Easy Rider that was uneasy. LAUGH It wasn't easy to be an Easy Rider. LAUGH ROCK MUSIC There is here no measuring with time, no year matters, and ten years are nothing. Being an artist means, not reckoning and counting, but ripening like the tree which does not force its sap and stands confident in the storms of spring without the fear that after them may come no summer. It does come. But it comes only to the patient, who are there as though eternity lay before them, so unconcernedly still and wide. I learn it daily, I learn it with pain to which I am grateful: patience is everything! MUSIC Often times Dennis and I would spend hours together without speaking to each other because after 45 years we knew what we were thinking. And we didn't have to do a lot of talking. I pointed things out to him, he pointed things out to me but we really didn't do a lot of conversation. MUSIC I always used to tease Dennis Hopper as a hayseed, that is, he came from the flat lands of Kansas, from the agricultural part of America, not the cultural part, not the sophisticated, civilized raised pinky part of Hollywood and western civilisation. MUSIC Well there's an interesting parallel, if you go to Kansas, you live in Kansas, and you have no, you look around, all you see is this horizon. The fact that you get somewhere, and you can achieve that from that upbringing, you kind of, it's hard to let go of that. And especially with all the indulgences he had. Dennis was very prolific. His photography, and his poetry, and his sculpting MUSIC I think it comes from a very unhappy childhood. Wanting to not getting enough approval from the house, from the home, having to look for it in other places, having the drive to wanna be something, wanna be somebody but really not having the education because of the schooling to be able to do anything, but perhaps play sports, fight a bull, race a car or be an actor. MUSIC He was the Shakespeare kid from Dodge City. How am I gonna get outta here? Acting. I'm gonna be an actor. MUSIC I mean obviously the guy was curious about the world and took the time to study it and to learn about it. But he was jut like a child. I can't say it in any other way, it's... amazing. He had a wide-eyed looked like this, he had that look in his eyes that he discovered the world for the first time every day. MUSIC When I was doing this film on James Dean and Dennis Stock recently, I encountered a lot of images from Rebel Without A Cause with Dennis Hopper in the picture, a very young looking Dennis Hopper. MUSIC What are we gonna do with him? Oh, don't worry, I'll figure out what we are going to do with him. You ever been in a chickie-run? Yeah, that's all I ever do. MUSIC He thought he was the best actor in the world until he met James Dean. Then, after James Dean died, he knew that he was the best actor in the world. MUSIC At 21 I was dropped from my contract at Warner Bros. because I was considered too difficult to work with, I been infected with James Dean and I was blackballed by the studios. MUSIC I don't think Hollywood can cope with actors, much less directors that have their own vision. Okay, Scene one, Take one, each is for Hollywood Action! He represented freedom and rebellion and the outsider and that's kind of a big topic, that he was rebelling against the ordinary. Against the word no . If he said he couldn't do it, he tried. MUSIC I can remember Easy Rider when it was first being talked about, and how it built within the community I was in, huge, huge interest in something, that was as revolutionary as Easy Rider was. All we represent to them, man, is somebody that needs a haircut. Oh no. What you represent to them, is freedom. What the hell is wrong with freedom, when that's what it's all about? Oh yeah, that's right, that's what it's all about alright. MUSIC If you look at the acid trip in Easy Rider , it's very quick and very much like, well like commercials are these days, not like they were then, because I went a little further, I pushed it a little further than I'd seen it. I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die! I did it. I did it. Do you understand? Its' like a piece of Jazz, that you're watching. That stuff's not written. That stuff is felt, I mean, when you see that scene on LSD in the cemetery, that's brilliant and that's what Dennis did. I know it. I know you. I know you. The drug culture was beginning to roll into town and the world was really aware of that and this movie was so simple in it's direct approach to addressing drugs and so, yeah, the movie was a trip. AMBIENT SOUND This was our introduction to the centre of counter-culture thinking. MUSIC You will see in small areas, like towns in Mexico, the counter culture still holds on. Where you won't find it in mainstream America. And a lot of people end up living here, for that. MUSIC ENGINE SOUND MUSIC He's right here in our backyard and every now and then we get on our bikes and we sit there by him and sound our bikes there for him, and let him know that we re still riding, we re around. INAUDIBLE MUSIC Dennis Hopper Day just summons us like a sea in Taos. And of all the people that showed up to ride, and the screening of Easy Rider , the fact that Patricia Arquette is here it means a lot to me, and it means a lot to, you know, the people that loved Dennis. So it was a little rough last year, and if it's washed out now, we decided to go a different route, so we're gonna take Movery Hill out to the highway, across the gorge bridge, we'll meet there and then we'll go from there. ENGINE SOUND MUSIC MUSIC Ask yourself in the stillest moment of your night: must I write? Delve into yourself for a deep answer. And if this should be affirmative, if you may meet this earnest question with a strong and simple "I must," then build your life according to this necessity. MUSIC Two or three film accounts I've read where they say What is the worst film that's ever been made? and a few times I've seen the Hopper film. In my book, it's one of the most interesting. There was this story of the film being made in this village, the population of the village remakes the film, but when they remake the film, they make the cameras and so on, but then they actually use real guns to shoot each other, where in the Hollywood film, the actors come, they come to the village, they shoot the film and of course they use prop guns and that part of the film was really, like, that was pretty, I thought that was really interesting. I thought it was marvellous. I thought it was a very sophisticated film, the obvious direction he should have gone in after Easy Rider , more complicated than Easy Rider , a better script, more complicated characters, much better story, editing fantastic. AMBIENT SOUND When you're so close to a movie, you're in the movie, you wrote it, you directed it, how do you get any kind of distance, you know. So you keep editing, you show it to friends, they don't like this, this one doesn't like that, you re-edit and you keep editing and editing and editing. MUSIC There was a Hollywood editor, a friend of mine, Davis Burlatsky, who put the film together and basically built the different sequences. And then, his ideas and Dennis' clashed and one evening, it was just like something out of a movie, I got called to Dennis' house and I was asked Can you finish this movie? And I said yeah, I think I can so that's how I came about and then what we did is we polished the different sequences and brought it from 5, 6 hours down to a movie. MUSIC There was one instance where they were pressuring him to bring the movie back before it was finished, and so he, I don't know if he called, Danny ...and he said: The film's been stolen, they came in with masks and tied us all up and took the film away . So, everybody knew that didn't happen, but it proved for the moment to reduce the pressure. I wanna thank the cast and the crew for a hell of a lot of wonderful cooperation. I enjoyed making this picture and I knew it was difficult in this damn rugged location. God bless all of you, I see you back in Hollywood. I went to the opening night, filled with a lot UCLA film students from that period. People hated the movie. And it could be, because when you're expecting so much, here is a movie that took so long to make, this person who's transgressive, sensitive, associated with a movie that, by that point, is a cult movie and then you get The Last Movie , you don't know what to do. ROCK MUSIC The critics were dazzled and confused. I think he was victimized by that, the fact, that Dennis Hopper was willing to go the extra step. The extra mile to make a film that was so radically different, so unlike conventional Hollywood pulp, if you will, that he overstepped his balance in that, he painted out of the frame. ROCK MUSIC We are solitary. We may delude ourselves and act as though this were not so. That is all. But how much better it is to realize that we are so; yes, to begin by assuming it. We shall indeed turn dizzy then, for all points that our eyes are been accustomed to rest on are taken away from us, there is nothing near anymore, and everything is infinitely far. A person removed from his own room and, almost without preparation and transition, and set up on the height of a great mountain range, would feel something of the sort. MUSIC He began to feel like the public was beginning to recognize him and it made him nervous and made him paranoid. And so he kind of like had to get out of Hollywood, he had to get away from all of that and Taos was like a perfect place for him then. MUSIC Yeah in the early seventies it was much more outlaw sort of place. And it's been very commercialized since, but Dennis was one of the free spirits, with of course, Mabel Dodge and Frida Kahlo and various others were there, it was an artists community. For a long time. And Dennis entered it and gave another feeling to it. MUSIC Yeah, we did a lot of hiking, arrowhead hunting, but he wasn't one that picked up a lot of stuff, he was more, I think he was just absorbing the fact that we were walking through history, through a natural history museum, a living museum, I think that that was a facet. MUSIC I think he shared a lot of the Indians beliefs in history and so he was really, he investigated that, he really did, yeah. TRIBAL MUSIC TRIBAL MUSIC In Taos he found mysticism, a sense of the Indians, of what's preceded, of what's there now, so I think that in a lot of ways, he found some real residence and significance for himself in Taos. MUSIC Well, he was an icon. So, when he came, he was welcomed on an equal basis, unlike Hollywood, where movie stars have a class distinction. They are above the pedestrians. But not here. . ROCK MUSIC Yeah we would just run into each other on parties and have fun... - There was a great party, remember the one at.. That's where I met you, actually... MUSIC Was a really cool party. - Satya was hanging from these rafters, that was the first time I saw him. He's like hanging from these fucking rafters, I said Who is this guy? LAUGH MUSIC My girlfriend at the time, was reciting a poem and Dennis Hopper opened his mouth while she was giving the poem and I said You have to have artistic respect Dennis, shut that Hollywood mouth. Let her talk." You know. And, you know, he did. Cause everybody was the same there. MUSIC He had a fantastic life there and very, sort of special American dream, the counter culture dream. Maybe he said: Look, I don't wanna look glamorous here, I'll be this other kind of character. WESTERN MUSIC I remember him reading If Rudyard Kipling, I saw him do it live... You know, Dennis, one time, there was a TV-Show, the Johnny Cash Show, you know, the musician had a talk show for a few years It was on the Johnny Cash Show, exactly. Exactly. Exactly, yeah, forgot that. Johnny says I think you have something you wanna share, Dennis, right? In that voice, Johnny Cash. He gets up there, and Dennis like just, it's like three minutes of the most incredible performance ever, I mean, it's really worth watching if you've never seen If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream but not make dreams your master; I mean he knew the whole thing, word for word, it was insane. It's a really long poem. And he knew it perfectly. And wow, you know, that says a lot about him, that he, not only did he know it, but he knew what it was about. He understood the meaning behind it. If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds worth of distant run Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it And which is more you re gonna be a man, my son! MUSIC That's for you, Dennis. The sun came out just for Dennis. It did, look! MUSIC In the centre of the cyclone here, cyclonic action surrounds us, but we remain tranquil. GUITAR MUSIC And he was rough, too, the whole period he was in Taos with guns and stuff, he was scary. I visited him, stayed with him up in Taos, this was like and we went shooting guns, and he has these automatic weapons, and we went off and did that, and I just felt like Boy, this is hard, I never do anything like this and yet Dennis wanted to do it, you know, he wanted to go off in the countryside and shoot these guns off, so that's what we did. WESTERN MUSIC They try to victimize icons like Dennis, though. It happened all the time. Like, the IRS got Dennis, you know, the Internal Revenue Service. That's what they're called, the IRS. Dennis got in trouble with the whole alphabet, the FBI, the CIA, the IRS, you name it, any part of the alphabet Dennis got in trouble with. WESTERN MUSIC ''LA Fonda'' Did you get a shot of the jail? Dennis was one of the most prominent residents, there it is, now. But I got him out, 10 minutes argue, I wouldn't allow him to be detained. MUSIC And even if you were in some prison the walls of which let none of the sounds of the world come to your senses would you not then still have your childhood, that precious, kingly possession, that treasure-house of memories? WESTERN MUSIC Well, I met Dennis probably in 1972 or 3, when I was going to produce my first film in Australia about an outlaw. WESTERN MUSIC And we rented a little plane, took flight from Albuquerque to Taos and then Dennis was waiting for us at the airport in a pick-up van, with a firing gun in the air next to the plane. That was the introduction to Dennis Hopper... ...very similar to the character of 'Easy Rider'. WESTERN MUSIC And he wanted to play the part in this film and Daniel Morgan was a character from history, he was an outlaw, a Robin Hood sort of character, and Dennis empathized with this character. GUITAR MUSIC Dennis arrived in Sydney, Australia with nothing. ''Where is your luggage, Dennis?'' - ''I don't have any, man.'' ''What about your clothes?'' ''You're supplying them.'' ''What?'' - ''Yeah, man!'' And that was Dennis, you know. And he just arrived in a pair of Levi's, no socks, checked shirt and a passport. ''I'm ready.'' And by the second night he was there, he was in jail. DOOR SMASHING We had to get him out of jail and get him out of town to get him away from the dogs and the bars and the fantastic stuff cause he was trying to become Daniel Morgan. It's your money or your life and it's in that order. ''It's your money or your life in that order.'' And he liked to do that, to anybody, and he would maybe like a couple of bourbon, but he was holding them up in his mind. GUNFIRE Stand and deliver Sir! What's happening, that there was no hotel left in this town, nobody accepted Dennis in the hotel room. What does that mean? There's a reward for you, dead or alive. That's what it means. The hotel room was a bit like a rock band on the road. And when the managers would look into a room which was somehow being damaged, they just said ''But why''. And I found it very difficult to explain that he was having a good time, you know. WESTERN MUSIC Dennis left after the shooting in Australia going to Daniel Morgan's grave and pouring Whiskey over it and being stopped by the police having the highest alcohol rating ever. Last time I saw Dennis, he left Australia in the same set as he arrived. With nothing. He arrived in the Levi's suit and he left with the Levi's suit and the passport. That was it. GUITAR MUSIC TRUMPETS ''Apocalypse Now'', there was a stroke of brilliance there, that, it was very much like him in his kind of stream of consciousness, understanding and expressing a character. I mean, what are they gonna say man, when he's gone, huh? 'Cause he dies when it dies, man, when it dies, he dies! What are they gonna say about him? What? That was a kind man? He was a wise man? He had plans? He had wisdom? Bullshit, man! He was telling me on ''Apocalypse Now!'' he'd get so high, that he wandered off into the jungle and nobody could find him for ten days. He was in the jungle for ten days and then showed back up, and he says he has no recollection of what happened. I mean, who survives ten days in the jungle?! GUITAR MUSIC GUITAR MUSIC He was brilliant in ''The American Friend'', I think that might be, maybe that's my favourite performance of his. He's great in Wim's movie. DRAMATIC MUSIC SINGING DRAMATIC MUSIC I like this room. I make money. And I travel a lot. It was rather unsatisfying and Bruno was upset. On the second day, we have it another shot. I asked Dennis if he could stick a little bit more to the script. But when he again improvised, Bruno's response was to punch Dennis in the face right in the middle of the take. That was a beautiful relationship that he had with Bruno Ganz. GUITAR MUSIC ...God knows, that's where I wanna be... GUITAR MUSIC This gangster from the Reeperbahn, Wolfgang Von Hamburg, he insisted on taking us to the airport, ''No I insist'', you know. And so, he was showering us with gifts. Put that away, seatbelt on... Man I am zoned. Zoned, take these, take these, take these! And he makes a fool of himself, by driving his car, erratically, right in front of the concords, where the leading terminal of Hamburg airport. CAR SOUND That's exactly right, exactly, exactly. And then he took out a bunch of coke and poured in on the dashboard under the wind shield, so that anybody passing by would have no problem noticing it. Shut up, shut up, gives you that mysterious touch, you know what I mean. It's one thing to be in the Reeperbahn but not at the airport, cause that's the frontier. Anything goes there, you know, cops can do whatever they want. The white star, oh fuck. Do you know (INAUDIBLE) press conference, get in the car... Why did you get this car? I said get outta here, ...hell. Don't let that fool you. See this, okay, 5 minutes, 5 minutes, right. Oh, man... I'm Henry the VIII. off with their fucking heads But it was rock music. MUSIC Burroughs had written a book called ''Junkie'' and I was curious about whether they have ever written a screenplay. So I checked with Dennis and the time, said ''Do you ever remember working with Burroughs on the script for''Junkie'', he said ''It was the seventies, I don't remember the seventies'' He didn't really had fun at that time. And I was like ''Come on, you mean all these drugs, LSD, Cocaine, you didn't have like, a little fun'' And he was like ''No, not really'' And that was very shocking for me. He'd come to this decision and realized, like, you know, I'm not getting where I wanna be, you know I'm kind of caught in this trap of alcohol and cocaine. And I have to get out of not one, but both. And he did! How remarkable. I tried everything. Booze, coke, nothing works. There is only one honourable solution: The Roof. DRAMATIC MUSIC Everything is gestation and then bringing forth. To let each impression and each germ of a feeling come to completion wholly in itself in the dark, in the inexpressible, the unconscious, beyond reach of one's own intelligence, and await with deep humility and patience the birth-hour of a new clarity: that alone is living the artist's life. MUSIC He was practically a zombie and we brought him to ''New Beginnings'', the rehab centre and he emerged successfully, never to have another drink for the last 23 years of his life and I think, that's when he spread out as a creative artist. MUSIC Don't you fucking look at me! It was provocative? I don't know. If really, it is difficult for me to comment on a film that was written and directed by David. You know, because my responsibility is not the film, it was the character. LOUD BREATHING But the most touching to me was Dennis Hopper, one day, I remember, we were doing the scene where Dennis Hopper comes to hear my character sing. And he is holding a piece of blue velvet rope, and that's a cue for the character played by Kyle McLachlan to understand that there is something connecting us. So I was singing away, that was what I had to do, and I looked down at Dennis, and Dennis was crying. And I thought, Wow, he's an incredible actor! He, the character he played, loved Dorothy. But he was a violent, he was angry at himself, he should not love a woman. And that's why he beat her up. But in the woman that I was on stage and slightly removed, he could give in to it, and cried, because he was in love with her, and the rage of saying, ''I don't wanna be in love with any woman, I'm a tough guy.'' I thought that was an incredible actor's choice. It wasn't written. He did it. SLOW PIANO MUSIC So actors can add. And of course David Lynch took it. ROCK MUSIC Dennis, I photographed him once, in the mid-nineties, in Los Angeles, in a hotel room. Like an angry looking guy. But because of ''Blue Velvet'', you know, that was really what I was looking for him, I loved that edginess that he had in this film. It's a master performance. GUITAR MUSIC I think it's hard to beat the intensity that he had in ''Blue Velvet''. I don't think I've ever seen that equalled in a still picture. I photographed him in Bottrop in Germany with some trees that were wrapped up for the winter and it was a surrealistic kind of sight, but it was part of my fake paparazzi pictures, so it was just to create a mystery, really. And then the picture I liked best out of those was, the moment when I opened the camera slightly too early, there was light falling into it. And that kind of accident made that picture the best of the shoot. GUITAR MUSIC I worked with Dennis on a film that I directed in Spain, where he came for a day, and he and Grace Jones had a scene together. In the desert in Armenia. Which was great, and he came out thoroughly charming and delightful. Everybody came to the set, I think there were like 6 actors called that day, like 25 actors came because they all just wanted to see Dennis, watch him. I'm looking for a room. There are no rooms No rooms. Well where do you sleep? In the shed, behind the petrol station. I ain't sleeping in no shed. LAUGHTER Of course not, darling. Boy, I just let him go, really. I mean, the thing is, if actors know, if they're good actors, I think they know the character better than the director does. It doesn't look like you're sleeping in a shed to me. LAUGHTER When Dennis burst out laughing, when all these guys come to him with guns and stuff, they come through the window, , that's perfect. I wouldn't have done that, it wouldn't have occurred to me, but it was perfect, you know. He knows what to do, he's his character. I wanna give you my card, I.G. Farben, Ranch Style Homes. Helping people help themselves to have a home. If he was working on a B-movie with a super low budget or a giant project, like ''Waterworld'', the huge budget movie, Dennis gave 100 percent. Artistically, emotionally, spiritually and performance-wise. GUITAR MUSIC ''Backtrack'' was really interesting, because it began in Venice, California, where Dennis lived, and he made it about that Venice artists community. So he would have, like he had Bob Dylan playing Laddie Dill, the Venice artist. And it was quite funny really, it was quite comical, because Dylan, again, is an amazing musician, but not necessarily an actor. And so Dylan would like, we would do the takes, and Dylan would go ''Uuh, I haven't seen Laddie Dill in a long time '' And Dennis goes, Cut, cut, you re Laddie Dill! ''Oh, yeah, right right right Another take ''Uuh, I haven't seen Laddie Dill in a long time.'' - ''Cut, cut, you re Laddie Dill!'' ''Oh, right, yeah yeah yeah''... I haven't seen Anne Benton in a long time. Her forms aren't exactly simpatico. Who did you say you were working for? Oh I work for Bank of America. It was entertaining to see Dennis in the middle, recreate the Venice artist community with rock'n'rollers. WESTERN MUSIC So Venice California was not only a great community for artists and aspirant artists, it was also the only community on the Pacific Coast in Los Angeles where minorities could afford to live. The criminal element, gangsters, so it was a real mix, really interesting. I rode the bus off Lincoln Boulevard, got off at the bus stop, walked down Indiana Avenue to Dennis house, hung out with him a couple of hours, walk back and I find, and I walk back and I'm shadowed by young gangsters These guys from the neighbourhood, you know... And the thing is, I'm also carrying my bags, they don't realize this, but in my bags is this really expensive camera equipment. And I'm thinking,''Oh man! These guys are gonna, are these guys gonna heist me for my camera equipment now? And I saved 50 cents by riding the bus!'' You know. And I sit down at the bus stop to wait for the bus to come, one of them comes up to me and he goes ''Dennis Hopper man! Yeah!'' WESTERN MUSIC I'm just in L.A. I was working at a gas station in Beverly Hills, and I really wanted to meet Dennis Hopper. And I would tried to find out where he lived. And somebody told me he lived in Venice somewhere. Then I rode there on my motorcycle, I had a '74 sportster and I rode there and I found this big, metal house with this big fence around it and I said That's where Dennis Hopper lives . And I went around the back of it and there was a big gate and it was open. And I rode in, and there was a garage and I stopped the bike and I heard his voice ''Hey, man''. And I looked up and there he was in the window, he was looking down, he goes ''What are you doing, man?'' And I go ''Well I came to meet you'' And he goes ''That's usually closed, man, that gate's usually closed, man'' And I go ''Well, I'm sorry, I'm not on your property'' ''You are on my property, man'' And so I, you know, I backed it out, you know, and I said ''I'm sorry, man'' and he goes ''Cool, cool, man'' And I said Okay you know, and then he was watching me and I rode away, you know. And that was when I actually first met him. COUNTRY MUSIC Have you seen ''Hell ride''? COUNTRY MUSIC The first thing I said when I got to the set, I go ''Where is my bike?'' Ironically, two days later when he started I heard someone say ''Dennis is here'' and I said ''Oh, man'' So I went outside and there he was, and he goes ''Where is my bike, man?'' LAUGHTER and I said ''That's what I said!'' He started laughing, he goes ''Yeah I wanna ride it, man'' I go ''Yeah'' And the transport guys were really worried, like ''Oh, isn't he like, old, you know, he's super old, isn't he like 80 years old?'' And I was like ''Guys, you gotta let him go out and ride this thing. Guys, no, man''. MOTORCYCLE ENGINE How long have you had that bike? Since 1976. Follow me if you can! Everyone's going ''Oh my god, he's riding it'' And of course he was, I mean he knows how to ride a motorcycle. I love that movie so much. A lot of people think, it's a silly film but I love that movie cause he's in it. The Gent. That's me. Pistolero would like to chat with you and Comanche. Well thanks for the latest breaking news there, Wolf Blitzer. I do have a story that I wanna tell, about Dennis. Because it really meant a lot to me when it made me really understand how much pressure he was under to be Dennis. Which was, when we were working on Hot Spot, we went to a County Fair in Texas. And we drank a lot of ice tea, and I needed to use the bathroom, and they were looking at something, so I just raced off to use the bathroom. And I come back, and people are circling like sharks. Dennis is looking at the people. And they're just not saying anything, they're just circling him, staring at him. And I break through, and I go, 'What's going on?!'' and Dennis grabs me and we go walking, and he says, ''Don't ever do that again.'' And I said, '''Don't ever do what?!'' And he said, '''Don't ever leave me alone in a public place ever again. I have to keep moving.'' LOUD TALKING COUNTRY MUSIC Art too is only a way of living. Therefore save yourself from these general themes and seek those which your own everyday life offers you; describe your sorrows and desires, passing thoughts and believe in some sort of beauty describe all these with loving, quiet, humble sincerity, and use, to express yourself, the things in your own environment, the image from your dreams, and the object of your memory. GUITAR MUSIC You know, when I was gonna make ''Basquiat'', the first film, that I directed, he was the first person that said, he would be in the movie. And the fact, that Dennis was in the movie, other actors figured, okay, we'll give Julian a chance, we'll see if he can do it or not. All the painters please. All the painters. Mr. Bischofberger please. Dennis' role as the art dealer Bruno Bischofberger is so brilliant, , so spot-on, I would say, that Dennis is even better than Bruno in life. Yeah just have them drop you at Mr. Chow's. We'll all be there. It's a great show! You wanna know how it was playing Burno Bischofberger? Exactly. LAUGHTER He wears these knickers, you know, with the socks and the thing, it was very funny, I thought it was very funny. Julian said I was a little like Peter Sellers. It was funny, I had a Swiss accent which I used, you know, ''Ja, ja. Buy the painting, ja, wonderful, ja, this is wonderful'' So, more or less like that. I mean, this is the one, I absolutely have to have this one. I mean, this is super fantastic. Jean-Michel, I must have it. I think what we're talking about is somebody that was authentic and who wasn't compromised and who, whatever he did, it was true to him. And sometimes, what he did was very very extraordinary. SPILLS LIQUID SPILLS LIQUID SPILLS LIQUID Is it art? Or is this art? I like what Marcel Duchamp said about ''The artist of the future will be a man, who points his finger and says ''That's art'' and it'll be art. MUFFLED TALKING I allowed myself to paint, I wanted to take photographs, because I wanted to direct films, I learned not to crop my photographs, I never cropped any of my still photographs, so that I would use the full frame when I would become a director of a film. So I never saw any of these disciplines as being different from the others, I just saw one continuing, to be a way of expressing oneself emotionally. ROCK MUSIC I met him through a gallery, Ferus Gallery, here in L.A. He went to Claes Oldenburgs wedding, shot pictures there and he got that great picture of Rauschenberg holding his tongue out. I think the photographs he took of people, at parties, of Warhol and all the guys, over the years, were quite special. And they been the photos that have documented the period more than anybody, I think. GUITAR MUSIC You would always see Dennis and he'd have that Nikon around his shoulder and sometimes two, sometimes three Nikons. GUITAR MUSIC GUITAR MUSIC I had done a painting, a big painting called ''Radio'', with the word ''radio'' and I believe he saw that and he's taking pictures of his friends, you know and I say ''Wow, that's fine, sure, what do you wanna do?'' And he said ''Well I got this idea, let's go down on Santa Monica Boulevard.'' GUITAR MUSIC And so he said ''Just stand there'' and look in the camera and not much direction or anything, just ''Look in my camera and be yourself'', something like that, something really simple. And, you know, he, 5 minutes, he was happy. So he was shooting lots of film, and he would find things on the street, he would find, like, common things that were on the street, signage, you know, iconography of the streets, of Los Angeles. GUITAR MUSIC That's why I'm so drawn to like, graffiti, and these sort of infantile scratches and images on wall, because it's very much like our life, I mean, we're here for such a little moment in the whole scheme of things, but we each contribute a little bit to the building block of culture, and we all work in the vineyards of culture. SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC He wasn't a guy like Gerhard Richter where painting was what he did and here is these different groups and... everything is very very clear. Because he was more of a fluxis artist and I mean, he did extraordinary things. I mean, when he blew himself up in Texas, for example, that was a great performance. I believe it's called ''Life and death on canvas'', where he filmed himself doing this stuntman's trick. Are you ready? 'Cause the stuntman is... Staying all in the same place. Dennis gets in the middle of this circle, is ignited, this tremendous explosion. We're getting ready. EXPLOSION I think nobody can possibly survive being in the centre of this and here Dennis just walks out. Hey! ... Hey man. Woo. Woo! Woo. Woo. It also shows kind of the extreme, kind of the craziness of Dennis' aesthetic during that period. Woo. Woo! Woo. Woo. Hey man. How about professional people working huh?! Professional people working... It meant a lot to him to have his work shown in an art context. MUSIC This tonight, I think it's an important event in modern art history cause Dennis', his life as an artist has encompassed and been woven in, inextricably with a big art movement of the west coast, I mean come on, it's major people we're talking about here. And this, tonight is like a combination of it and the recognition of his works. SLOW MUSIC The art world can be very stubborn, even cruel, saying Dennis Hopper, he's an actor, he can't be an artist, he's not allowed to be an artist . SLOW MUSIC The world is run by mediocre people. And he didn't really fit in, he didn't fit in one category. And so, he was always an outsider. Which would make him very attractive and at the same time made things difficult for him. What is that? Hey, look at that, I'm in business, I just found a piece of post-modern deconstructivist art. Hey, wait a minute. Is he the artist, because he made it or am I the artist because I found it? Or is just Charlie Saatchi the artist because he sells it and sells a fortune from it. If everything is art, then nothing is art. At least, not until somebody wraps a lot of long words around it. So in that perspective it was very good to see somebody and know somebody like him, that would bridge these different worlds. That someone could come and penetrate these various kinds of roles of the art world. You know, acting, painting, photography, movies, all of this and it was a rare thing to see. MUSIC Perhaps it will turn out that you are not called to be an artist. Then take that destiny upon yourself and bear it, its burden and its greatness, without ever asking what reckon pins might come from outside. For the creator must be a world for himself and find everything in himself and in nature, to whom he has attached to himself. ROCK MUSIC He's a unique individual. And Dennis Hopper chose film as his primary vehicle to express his creativity. But anyone who knows anything about his life knows that it went in many different directions. He had a keen eye for not only art, but also for photography and also for music. Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain, there was a town where the people known as the Happy Folk lived. Their existence was a mystery to the rest of the world He performed on the Gorillaz album as a music artist. So he was able, uniquely, I think, to express himself in many different ways. The mountain called Monkey had spoken. There was only fire, and then nothing. One of his key characteristics is not only to stay curious about life, but also to constantly reinvent himself. And that's very necessary for creativity. I think that's one reason why he liked U2 so much, because U2 always works hard to reinvent their music. Welcome ringside, from Dublin, Ireland, with a record of five MTV Awards... He used the analogy of being a champion, fighting hard, which is also what Dennis does, as a warrior, and used that to introduce U2 and the fans absolutely loved it. U2. Yeah! It's unusual for anyone in the creative industry to be able to bridge gaps of different generations. And that's exactly what Dennis Hopper could do. He did it so successfully. He stayed current. This is Bruce Smith s shoe, man. Huhu. Wait a minute. This is this is Rod Woodson's shoe! Stacy Wall wrote these Nike commercials with this strange character, it's like a homeless referee and asked me to shoot some commercials. I was surprised that Dennis wanted to do the spots. I'm looking forward to the season like a slug looks ... First day, it almost went down the toilet. The second commercial was him singing a song, this is my favourite. ... Richard White, Steve Young, Arian Foster and players with much longer names, yeah. He asked for the Teleprompter, and I said: ''We don't have a teleprompter'' . He blew up, said ''My agent specifically asked for a teleprompter'' then stormed off into his trailer. I said ''Here it goes, it's over''. So I quickly got some big cards and I started writing the cue card and the assistant director is writing the other half. He came out, he came storming out of the trailer, says ''Just throw the stuff away''. Nailed it, 2 or 3 takes, perfect each time. Perfect. Yeah! I'm looking forward to the season and especially the Two-Point Conversion. He was using himself as a guinea pig in whatever shape or form or whatever medium he was using. And sometimes he would hit it, and it would be great, and sometimes he didn't. SLOW GUITAR MUSIC I met Dennis on my very first movie called ''The Piano Player''. Can someone explain to me what this is all about? Am I a prisoner or something? Erica. I've had to make some very important decisions about my life. He was impatient with me because I didn't get things right from the get-go, and then he could see that I was very intimidated and then he finally asked me, like, ''How long have you been an actress?'' and I said Basically, this is it and from then on, he really, he taught me everything. Erica, don't make things so difficult. I may not be a perfect father. But I believe in my own way, I did my best to raise you. You know, when he liked somebody, he could be generous, he would have given you his last shirt. But he was also a very, you know, he expected a lot from people. If he felt like you were not paying attention or you weren't good enough for what he saw should be given he could be harsh. He didn't really get along with the director and my other co-star. And you know, he tried to convince the director that the scene between these two actors just wasn't gonna work and that he should really do a scene where he talked to a goat for ten minutes. Mr. Goat, do I know you? I'm Robert Nile. And at the end of the day, that's what happened he cut the other actor out of the scene and he did the scene with a goat. LAUGHTER My mother split. You know what I'm saying to you? Do you think my daughter loves me? SLOW GUITAR MUSIC And he had to fight, all the time to, kind of, get by. It wasn t ...it was always a trial somehow. You know, there's a line in this book about van Gogh, where he's reading one of these rhymes, it says ''Is the walking always be uphill?'' And the answer is, yes, it will. ''And is it gonna be over soon? No, it's gonna start early in the morning and it's gonna last till late at night''. ''And will it ever get any better? 'No, it won't.'' COUNTRY MUSIC I met Dennis many years ago in Barcelona. And I remember, just, you know, because I'm very shy, so, but I thought, ''Dennis Hopper is here, you have to tell him how much you admire him'', but then you know, after twenty minutes, he started drinking a lot, and you know, there was these two Japanese sisters, like really young, beautiful girls. That was the end of the conversation, with these two Japanese girls. MUSIC And then, you know, many years after, when we were casting ''Elegy'' we had Penelope Cruz, Ben Kingsley and we were looking for someone who is able to face Ben. And I thought about him, you know. MUSIC He said ''Nobody is offering me roles like this, I love it, it's great, yeah. And also, I have the opportunity to die and I love dying in movies''. APPLAUSE I think the shot we did more takes of was when he is dying and they have to kiss. That last grasp for life was that kiss in that movie. I owe you. AMBIENT SOUND DEEP BREATH And that scene was painful, because you can see the guy was, you know, he said he loved to die in movies, but it was clearly an exorcism for death in real life. UPBEAT MUSIC That is at bottom the only courage that is demanded of us: to have courage for the most strange, the most singular and the most inexplicable that we may encounter. That mankind in this sense has been cowardly has done life endlessly harm; the experiences that are called ''visions'', the whole so-called ''spirit-world'', death, all those things that are so closely akin to us. UPBEAT MUSIC Death is an arrow from the future, flying towards you. That is the fear of death. The fear of life is the fear of death. I'm the opening. I'm the connecting door, not the dead end! I'm the only way out. He suffered terribly actually. But he put on a face that didn't show that. Now. Take my portrait. He was ready to go, man. He was like ''You know what, I'm ready, that's it.'' You know, at the end, I never saw him seeming to be worried about it. You know? Even at the Star ceremony. I remember he was sitting with Jack Nicholson. And him and Jack were laughing about something. And I just thought ''Wow, I mean, there's a guy who knows that he's out of time but he's fine with it!'' John. John. Miss? Miss? Miss! Ten years before that, I was trying to figure out ''How does a person get a star on the Walk of Fame?'' you know. Even back then I was wondering about it, that it would be cool. And I was like ''Man, you know what? They're never gonna get me one of those fucking things, man. I'm never gonna get a star of the Walk of Fame.'' And Dennis goes, ''Haha, me neither man! Yeah, I've been trying to get one of those for years man!'' He goes, ''I'd have to be dying of cancer to get one of those man!'' And we laughed about it, we thought it was funny. And now man, all those fucking years later, I mean, look at it, that's exactly what happened. Poor guy is dying and they suddenly decided to give him one. By the way, when they said there were 403 stars already on Hollywood Boulevard, it's hard to believe, that it has taken this long to acknowledge the greatest star of them all. APPLAUSE Dennis Hopper is the coolest guy on the planet. APPLAUSE Ladies and gentleman, we proudly welcome to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Dennis Hopper! And I was very happy that he got it, he died a few weeks after he got his star. MUSIC All deaths are beginnings, not endings. And I like to think that Dennis went to a higher place, and I think he died a fulfilled man. AMBIENT SOUND This is for Dennis Hopper: See him wasted on the side walk, with his jacket and his jeans, wearing yesterday's misfortunes like a smile. Once he had a future full of money love and dreams, which he spent like they was going out of style. And he keeps right on to change, for the better of the worst, searching for a shrine he's never found. Never knowing if believing is a blessing or a curse, or if the going up was worth the coming down. He's a poet he's a picker he's a prophet he's a pusher. He's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned. He's a walking contradiction partly truth and partly fiction. Taking every wrong direction on his lonely way back home. MUSIC
