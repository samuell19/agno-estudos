Hey...why do people die? Because they're alive. Then where do they go after they die? They all... Go to Hell! Oh no! I'm going to be late!! Linne! Stop right there! You! Oh, "Gaga"! What did you say! "Gaga"? No, no! I had bread in my mouth! Fine then. Here, you forgot my present. Right...it was on purpose... Thanks, Mom... I'm going now! I'll make 100 friends at school! Behave in front of your new teachers! Already running around on her first day. Who did she get that from? My dear, please protect her. I'm really running late! Thanks to Mom's stupid notebook! Ouch...that hurt! You all right? Are you hurt? No, no! I must hurry! I'm going to be late! He was cute. Hope we go to the same school. And then we fall in love!! ...What am I thinking? Wait, is he late to school too? Bad omen from the morning! Servants of Satan. Brings bad news! Go back to Hell! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill! Kill! You crazy! Ou...That hurt! You're safe now. See? There's nothing scary. Bye! I'm leaving! Oh no, I'm late! The gate's closing! Wait for me! There! Made it! Ouch...not again... You all right? A girl shouldn't be here. Wow...! Ryu Kutou! Stop hitting on her and fight! This is the guys' quarter, girls' is over there. Oh, I see. Thank you very much! Hmm... Hey you, Kutou! This here? Has class started already? It's so quiet. He was so charming just now. So kind... Now's not the time for that! Here I go! ! I'm sorry, I'm late to class! No school uniform necessary? Urban schools are so cool! I am Linne Amagane. Please call me "Linne." You little punk, shut up and die! Don't act all innocent! Annoying! A lowlife just like us! A lowlife? I want to be friends with you! And how do you plan to be "friends" with us? Well, you see... You dreaming of "making 100 friends"? That school uniform! Strip her! You little brats! I'll play with you! Your teacher's loving severity! There goes again... Take this! My belt whip! This isn't physical abuse, but the will of Heaven! Don't stand in my way of education! I...I don't...permit...! You want her dead? Blood! Blood...! Blood! It's blood! What's all this rattle! Baby! Headmaster Helvis! Linne Amagane, you're already dead! Welcome to Destinyland. You've stepped into Hell, baby! Destinyland? Sounds fun, but I'm going home! Really? You'll swim your way out Destiny Sea? Rather called the "Death River" in your world? Death River? But I'm not dead! I've got my legs...and hands! Accept what's here! That's where you start. Despite a slight complication, as long as you're here, you sign this! Hell's registration form! Mom! Mom! What's happened to me? Boing...boing... Second class has started already... Hey Mom, it's me, Linne! Please pick up! Hello? Where is this? What's going on, Mom? You're already dead, Linne Amagane! I came through here, so should be able to leave! It was open just now! I am... I am going home! Impossible! We are gatekeepers! No one gets past without Headmaster's permission! Easy way in, not quite so out. We dare you to go through. Wait a minute... If I'm in Hell... They should know the truth. Because we're friends! Everyone, tell me something! Got you! Kiki... I won the bet, Wolfy! She for real? Such an old trick! "Even death's no cure to stupidity!" No, a moron too stupid to know she's dead! What are you talking about? We're all alive! See? So annoying... It can't... Can't be true! Still in denial. It's the truth! It's a lie that you're all dead! Just die! No...! Headmaster Helvis told you. Accept the reality. A dog! Stealer, good for you, eh? She's our new target. Let your dog Franken get her! Wait, wait... This dog... It's obviously dead, yet moving... I am... But I am not! OUT OF SERVICE I just can't believe it.. Mom... Where am I, Mom? How can I go back to you? Linne... Dear God, please protect my girl... My Linne... Oh, you're that kitty... From that crossing... You're not injured. I'm glad... Is this for me? A cocoon... But what is this for? Thank you, kitty, I'm happy... Will you be my friend? There's nothing to be scared about. See? It's all right. Your dog? That tickles! Looked everywhere for you, Linne! I can't believe that dog is friendly with anyone besides Stealer. You're new here, so I'll teach you something! You're so useless! You and your owner! You just do what you've been told! Right, Stealer? Unless you want us back... Protection shield! Hey... School principles... And our gate... shall not be broken! Here we go! Right! You've got some tricks! What's this? Not just her arm! Her whole body enlarged! Take this! Franken! Want Franken dead? You fool! Oh...What was that? Hollow... Be punished for attempted gate breaking! Stop it, please! She just tried to protect Franken! Class is in session, baby love! This voice! Where are you? I need to talk with you! Yeah! Oh yeah! ! Headmaster Helvis, please send me back home, to my world! Why? Why is that? I want to see Mom! You must graduate! That's the rule for you who died! That's the rule of Destinyland! No other way to go through this Gate to Heaven! This Death River Academy... grants all punishment of rule breakers... to the Student Council. Rock-and-roll! Study, baby! Study?Baby? Graduate? Graduate from what? I don't get it! Graduate?Baby? Linne, let's go home together! Okay? Home? To where? Didn't know there were this many people! All students? You stupid? She's got no brain. This is Death River Academy here. Academy? Kiki, you're acting weird... Leave me alone, Wolfy! I do what I want. I'm your friend, aren't I? What? What's she hiding? Huge! See you! Aren't we going home? Oh... This is...my room? Mom... Mom... I had a long day.. - Shut up! - I can't sleep! Who's that? If it's a dream, let it be over now... I'll be late! Morning! Linne, don't worry! No more tricks! We're friends! That... Why stare at me? Something weird on me? Announcement from the Student Council. Linne Amagane, please come to our office after school. Me? What! Linne? You! How dare you take my dear Kutou! Ryu Kutou? I heard that name somewhere... But who is he? "A girl shouldn't be here." Oh him! So he is the Student Council President? - How dare you! - He's mine! Die! Must be nothing. - You brat! - You newbie! Shut up! Don't get me started again! Got you! Again... It's about yesterday! I can't be late! Not this time! My dear Kutou! Sweet Ryu! Linne, sorry my long legs gave you a... Serves you right! Miss Amagane! Mom...It's me, Linne! Mom, Mom! Don't go, Mom! Wait, don't leave me! No! Oh? Look, look at her. No surprise. All dreams in Hell are horrible. No, what I mean is... She has blood. That's why I called her here. What do you mean, Kutou? Miss Amagane, sorry about earlier. No, it's because I was clumsy. But umm...where am I? Where were you headed, Miss Amagane? Pres. Kutou called me to the Student Council Office. This is the headquarter of the Death River Academy Student Council. Then you all are... Oh, haven't introduced ourselves yet... I am Rei Kagurazaka, the Vice-President. I'm Mario. Nice to meet you, Linne. My name is Luca. I am the Treasurer and Secretary. And I am Ryu Kutou, the President. Miss Linne Amagane. The Student Council's punishment for you is... What do you mean, Pres. Kutou? No punishment? Why not? You just happen to be there. Stealer tried to break the gate. She is to be punished. No, Stealer did nothing wrong. She just tried to protect her friend. Then... Why am I summoned here? That is our main point. There is no record that you died of an car accident. Actually there's no record of you. What? You shouldn't be here. I shouldn't? You must be shocked, but listen to me. Your nose bleed is the proof. Nose bleed? No one in Hell has blood. The more I look into your case, there are doubts. I believe someone intentionally sent you here. We don't have time, Miss Amagane. That's just... There she goes... Must have been all too much to digest. Don't be bummed, Kutou. That's right. She'll understand what we're saying. We just have to trust her and wait. Only God knows now. We're in Hell, Luca. There's...no God. Everything is just over my head... Don't know what to believe... I'm back! High spirit makes anything possible! - Eat my love! Don't waste any! - She's scary hut a great cook! High spirit is everything! Time to eat! Stay away from my dear Kutou! Phantoma, not the face! Body blow! What a childish notebook! Don't get near my dear Kutou, you kid! Give it back! Give it! Stop it, Phantoma, Kuronora! You're a little too much. Stay out, Kiki! Horrible things happen when you bully Linne. You want one in the body too? But...! Kiki, shut up! - Dorm Mother! - Hun! Meals are to be eaten in harmony and good spirit! No food as punishment! I won't give up! TO LINNE, FROM MOM TO LINNE, FHOM MOM Isn't that right, Mom? Oh, little kitty! Do you know the truth? You can tell me if only you spoke... Who knows the truth? Monstrous! High spirit makes... anything possible! You fool! Never works like that! Kutou, hurry up and take Linne! Watch out! Seismic charge! Mario, where's Helvis? Sorry, I lost him. I see. Miss Amagane, you're hurt. Oh, blood! You too! All of you! You see now? That's what Helvis really is. The first murderer of mankind and the one who brought you here. But you're alive. And so are we. I think it's hard to believe all at once, but... We can't go back to our world unless we heat Helvis. But how do we...? Miss Amagane... That's just...impossible! This is our only way out, Miss Amagane! Beat that...monster? But that's...I... I'm late in this situation? Headmaster Helvis destroyed it all! But why am I running? Is there class? What? No, stop! Help me! Please...! What is this...? Ah...! Helvis...Headmaster Helvis! What's that? How horrible! Sir Headmaster Helvis... Volleyball...I don't get it... The sports day event has been decided! It's volleyball, baby! The champion team will get one wish! But only one wish per student. Make a wish, baby! And fight, baby! Oh surprise! The school is back in tact! For real? You'll grant anyone's wish, Headmaster? Pres. Kutou! You have my word, Student Council President Ryu Kutou. Looking forward to your wish! Sweet Mario! Nice catch! Wow! Mario! Damn that Kutou! That monster! Hey! Mario? Pres... What's that? Pres. Kutou... Man... Oh, Mario! Where's Helvis? That devil? Huh? Where am I? The rooftop? That's right. Calm down, Linne. He's over there. Went back to Heartbreak Hotel as usual. Who is he? Helvis is the first murderer of mankind. Remember Kutou saying that? Yeah. There's an old story about Cain and Abel. Cain kills his younger brother Abel out of jealousy. The first murder in history. And that Cain is Helvis. Can you believe that? But that's the truth. Helvis made this Destinyland in Hell, and created Death River Academy. To accept the dead of this world. We don't know why, hut live ones like us are also here. It seems like those who are still alive and bloody, like you and me, are unlike other students and take human forms. Mario... I believe you, but... Why do you count me in? I don't have the power to beat a horrible creature like that. This. Blood? Right, both you and I are alive. Yeah... That's enough, isn't it? Instead of "power"? Thank you. But must win the tournament, so fight till we drop. Got it! So, how are you at volleyball, Linne? It's a secret! Damn, she's too good for Kutou! No...really! Huh? If our class wins, our wishes will come true! I want panties! Gimme spirit! No, not like those! Then what's your wish, Linne? I'm going back home, to Mom! Enough! Want another one to your body? Phantoma...! Oh drop it you two. Let's fight together and win! Huh? With volleyball? Exactly! With volleyball! School volleyball tournament, ball! Great Headmaster Helvis will... grant the wishes of the winning team, hall! The East Witches! The greatest! The East Witches! The champs! Volleyball! So great! We are East Witches! Giants! You dwarves! What a joke you challenging us! No doubt we'll win! Airheads! Shut up, jerk! Phantoma! Don't get it wrong! We came to tease! Came to watch your wish shatter to pieces! You rats! You've ridiculed an Olympic athlete! Win the tournament and win a date with Pres. Kutou! Date? - What a joke! - Yes, a date! Dear, catch me! Catch me! Fine! We'll win this tournament, and my date! Play hall! Impressed you got this far. But as an Olympic athlete, I shall free you of further pain! You're next! My date! Stealer...You! Phantoma, the next one! Let's go! Give it up! My date with Pres. Kutou! Now get to it! Everyone, we can do it! Anything is possible with spirit! Oh...yeah... How annoying... Just give it up! Judge! Electrifying is against the rule! Not in the rulebook, so no problem! Damn you! This'll finish you! Mom! Mom...! Mom...please...help me! Get it now? What matters is we win, not how! No! No... Never will I... ...give up! I can't end here! No, not even over my dead body! Keep saying that! The hall! Damn, over to Stealer! Oh no... We won! Yay volleyball! We're the best! East Witches are the... Huh...why? She reacted to save Linne! Her hands hit the hall and it returned to their side... Stealer! Most unexpected! The rats beat the East Witches and going to Round 2! A date with Pres. Kutou! Phantoma lost her edge... Everyone influenced by Linne... Where's that kid? Pres. Kutou's team is starting! I must hurry! Oh! Panda? Panda bears? Hey! We're Pandas, the best volleyball team! Oh? Huh? You all right, Miss Amagane? Pres. Kutou! Hey B&W! We'll play with you! With volleyball! Student Council, so what? You arrogant brats! Who you calling "B&W"? Me? We'll cream you! So... We're sorry...! STUDENT COUNCIL PANDAS Miss Amagane, see you at the finals. Kutou! You took my line! Humans are creatures of wishes. They can not exist without a wish. How valuable is that wish at this Academy in Hell Unexpected outcome! The rats going to the finals! Against the Student Council team, ball! Not here by mere luck, are they? Just as pumped as us! The crucial match point! Both teams at the end of their strength, ball! Linne Amagane's serve, ball! Linne, you coming? Coming, Linne? Come on! What the...! Ooops! All the way up there! Sorry, Kutou! The rats won the finals! Well done, baby! Headmaster Helvis, you promised! Grant us our wishes! Now! ! Don't be hasty. I'll grant your wishes. Make your wishes, baby! I've only got one wish... Only one! There! Boing, boing! I haven't gone back to Mom! If you insist, I'll kill her and bring her here. You'll be satisfied, Linne Amagane? Yours isn't a wish! Just denying reality! Kiki, I'm not mistaken! You understand, right? Huh? I don't get a thing, Linne. Such nonsense! It's impossible going back to your mom! Once you die, game over! But that's... Stealer, your wish hasn't come true... What is it, Stealer? Don't you have any wish? No, I have nothing. Stealer spoke! Stealer..volleyball...Mom... ...denial of reality... Grant her wish. You promised. I won't grant your wish, you loser! You tyrant! Even the Student Council President can't have his way? Not true. Won't give up as long as she's with me. NURSE'S OFFICE Why is it heating? Why? Rules made by others. If there's no meaning to them, I'll do it my way and go back to my world My own world for Mom! Here we go, Mom! Which way? Where am I? Huge! Looks like a huge rock... and alive too! No...it is alive! Indeed. Blimey! Who are you? You've come at last. Waited so long. Isn't that dangerous? You a teacher? No, not at all. I am God. That Linne! Worked up that she crashed your date? That's not true. I had fun playing volleyball... She's got guts. So just want to talk to her about him. But something doesn't fit. God's almighty, right? Why is God in Hell? Don't you all say, "God is dead"? Leaving me aside, you shouldn't be in Hell. Hell is where the dead leaving their bodies, come only in the form of souls. Right. Then why are you here when you're not dead? That's the big mystery. To solve that, I must first tell you about Cain and Abel, because one of the brothers brought you here to use you. "Cain and Abel"? Mario said that was the first murder. Indeed. The first murder of mankind was between Cain and Abel. Cain, who killed his younger brother Abel, is Helvis. Abel's soul wandered around the Death Hiver. And his soul eventually made Destinyland... as a place for revenge, waiting for his brother Cain's soul. Cain won the battle and Abel's soul... You listening? But this sound, "thump, thump.." What is it? Listen to God! Hold on! Pres. Kutou...? Why? As I suspected, you can tell... Cain concealed here, Abel's, no Ryu Kutou's energy... His madness. Pres. Kutou is Abel! But that...that's...! Cain and Abel or Helvis and Pres. Kutou, it's a brothers' quarrel! Ever since you were brought here, you have been dragged into it. If you can end their fight, you should be able to go back. Don't drag me in! Stupid brothers! That is... I can hear... It hurts, Mom! Mom, pull it out! You can hear that? Don't know why, but I should pull this out I...I can tell! This is the pain of Pres. Kutou... and of Helvis. Oh! You did it! I...I really did it! Never thought anyone could. That is Abel's grudges against me. It contained the harmful spirit. You realize what you're doing? I'll end your quarrel! I'm going home! Really think you can resolve this? If that madness returns to Abel, this Hell is over! Before Abel's madness awakens, return it to where it was! Whoever that brought me here, I've had enough! - Uh...what...? - Uh-oh! - Wha...! Gross! - Oh my God! Oh, this is...! Abel's madness! Wha...what! It's too late now... Abel's...Pres. Kutou's madness...? Now! She's gone! It's your doing! Where is Linne Amagane! As you can see, Abel's madness is beyond my, the Creator's imagination... I can't stop it anymore... And neither can you. But that child, she might be able to... You can't put all that burden on her! You've wanted that too, deep inside... Damn you, Damn God! How can you! It's coming! Damn! Stealer, run! Madness conquers all! Stealer! What! ! No! Take this! What' s this mess? - What's going on at the Academy? - Help me...! What's going on? Stealer? Kitty! No way, I'm God! What? You're the kitty I saved from the accident. Sorry, Linne. Couldn't protect you then. What's that? Why is a kitty talking? I'll explain later. Must take care of the situation first. You're right! Stealer! Stealer, I'll get you down! Abel locked down the Academy using Stealer's body. Watch out, Linne! Take this! Linne, no! Too dangerous! We'd better run! Stealer! ! Come back to us! Come back! What are you doing? Too dangerous! Let's go! You fool! We must save Stealer! But why? That's weird! You're not yourselves! It's only Stealer! Forget her! Shut up! We can't leave her! We've come this far together! That's right! Better take good care of friends! Came as fast as I could! Mario! What is this? What happened? Damn it! She's nailed to the gate! Dammit! What took you so long! What's happening? It's awful! Linnne, what happend to Stealer? What's this heart-like thing? It's Abel's madness. He's trying to use Stealer! What? Abel's...? I heard Pres. Kutou is Abel. Mario, why didn't you tell me? How beautiful friendship is... Friends are invaluable, precious... How dare you! Pres. Kutou! Explain to me! Stealer! Stop! Why, Stealer! Kutou! This isn't Stealer's will. So it's finally beginning...Abel... Abel! It's all thanks to you, Miss Amagane. So glad I brought you to Hell. Now I'm finally... Huh? What do you mean? This will... With this... I'll become my true self...! What's wrong, guys? Calm down. Unfortunately, Luca, Rei, it's time for goodbye... Rei, Luca... Hold on! They're gone! Where? Nowhere... Luca and Rei no longer exist. Stealer has the power of nothingness. Those consumed by her no longer exist. Only the souls are in Hell, and they extinguish. My madness here has liberated Stealer's power. How could you do that! Luca and Rei are your friends... Friends? Easily fooled by me! We all believed and trusted you as our friend! Mario...! Your arm...! Kutou, you said it! You said we'll beat Helvis together! Helvis who brought disorder to Hell! To restore reincarnation and escape! Don't be so hard on yourself. Damn it! What a fool I was, trusting you! I trusted you! But you brought me here! You deceived us all! It was all a lie! That's right! I needed Mom's blood to revive! I needed you, Miss Amagane, the reincarnation of Mom! Mom...? Now I'll just put this where it belongs. Abel! Don't be so selfish, baby! Headmaster Helvis! I'm so confused! What? Fine, I'll tell you. Mom should pay for the crime of hearing us sinned brothers! You're calling me "Mom"! My servants have awoken it seems... The 7 demons in Hell that represent the 7 deadly sins of human. To take revenge on Cain, I made a deal with them. They were your classmate rats. Our madness were concealed after our last battle. But they've risen again as my faithful servants. So Mom, you've no friends. Don't lie! Can't be true! Suit yourself. This world that God made in a week, I can now destroy it all in a week! Pay for your sin! I'll spare you from witnessing the world's end! Goodbye, Mom! Death is no cure for stupidity, is it? You see, Abel... That's no way of showing affection to your mom! You're...! You're...? You've forgotten me, Honey? Who are you? - Made it just in time. - Who are you? Get off me! It's me, Who. Your husband from your previous lifetime. Father! What are you doing here? Long time, Dad! Never wanted to see you again! What a greeting! Family reunion at last! Honey, we must do something about our outrageous kids. Linne, he is the first man on earth, Adam. You are the reincarnation of Eve, Adam's wife. Adam? Eve? That's right, Eve... Oh, you're Linne now. You and I came to Hell to end our kids' quarrel. What? No more fooling around. I'll pick up the pace. - Oh no! - Dammit! Take a good look! This is the real Hell! Mom! Dad! What the hell is this! Oh no! What have I done! Oh Linne... Putting such burden on... Help... Help me! Damn! There's nowhere to hide! Linne! Nooooooo! Honey? Thanks, Who. Come on, we're no strangers. My dear wife. Good, Linne's safe. Who's got speed. Wha...what's that! Stealer! No! They'll be gone! Stop it! Dad! Mom! All those in Hell sucked into her like an antlion. All the souls coming to Hell in the future will be too. The world will soon he left without a soul. This'll destruct reincarnation. People will suffer as long as they live. There is no suffering in the world of nothingness. So now... Come on, Mom. What's wrong, everyone? That's their true selves. Dad, Mom, resist me, hut it's pointless. Monday today. The world will end in 6 days. Dorm Mom, Pandas, don't give up! Look at that, Mom. So many souls vanishing. Hurry, help them! How can you...! Give up and surrender. You can't save a single soul, Mom! Bye, Mom! Never letting you go again, Honey! Still so earnest and reckless! Just as I remember! But if you can't protect yourself, you can't others. Hey! Watch your mouth! Not valuing your own life is the act of fools. Shut up, you brat! Linne risked her life to save me! Damn it! Damn it! I can't leave them! - Damn it! Damn it! - It's fine. That's your charm. I love you the way you are. Listen, Linne... That's right, baby! Linne Amagane! Leave it up to me! That's my line! Please take care of my brother, Abel. Hey! Come out, Abel! It's Daddy! Stop it now! What's all the noise? Who's there? You'll see Master Abel over my dead body! No, Phantoma, we're friends! I can't do that! Then just vanish! Wait, Phantoma! Enough! Master Abel has no time for this! Don't know what happened, hut you can't do such a horrible thing! "Don't know what happened"? Will you say that after you hear why he was murdered? I'll tell you! Come! If you dare see the truth about the first murder of mankind. "Leave all wishes thy who enter this gate." Giving them up, Honey? Don't be silly! I would never...! Never give them up! What the hell is this! Mario! Granny! Pandas! Linne, quick, find Phantoma! Okay, Lock. The gate! A pile of garbage I got here. Phantoma, let me speak with Pres. Kutou...Abel! Stepping in here means... You dare see the truth about the first murder? Shut up! You rat! Throw that rock into the well. The well will tell it all. Show me your determination. We'll talk after that. Phantoma's right I may have not made decisions till now But no time to contemplate... I have to do it. My choice. This rock is my choice. What? Who is this? This is...Linne! Linne? Similar hut not her... Then who? I'm young! Oh, this is...! Ad..Ada...Adam... Is Eve all right? Water here. Enough? Well done, Eve! You're the best! Dear, don't shout! Why not? I'm overjoyed! I remember... You""care Cain. Right? Cain"...? That's our..son's name? Perfect! Cain stood up! A genius! Silly Daddy.. Daddy'll work hard! Now that I think back.. I worried when you and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and expelled from Eden... God, you know... What is it, Adam? You felt like me now when you created me? That's random... Having a family is great. I think we ate that fruit for this. That's... Hey Cain! What, you jealous? You silly boy! Mom! I want Mom's milk too! Cain, you're a big boy now! Don't be difficult! They're no longer mine or yours! It's Abel's now! Too had! Mom's milk! Milk! No! You're a big brother now Okay... Abel, you"e injured! Mother, don't worry. - This is Abel? A crybaby! - He cut himself. - Shut up! - Just a scratch. Seem like a happy family. No way a murder can happen. However, Linne... Your previous life, Eve, is the cause of the murder. - What's wrong, Cain? - But how? You're still growing, Eat! You too, Abel. Y"h... Do you feel sick? What is this urge? I can't bear it anymore! I want Mother naked! When will you grow out of coming to me when you have a nightmare, Abel? Dear, Abel is still like a baby! We have 2 babies in the house. God, why did you create human? Create me? I created Adam and Eve, but your parents made you and Abel. They chose to have you and Abel. That was their choice. "Choice"? Adam and Eve chose to eat the forbidden fruit A choice is to make a decision and act upon it. You are the result of the human choice to have children. Mankind making choices is precisely what life is about. Cain! I finally found the lost lamb! Hey that tickles! No, stop it now! What happened, Cain? Why won't Abel return? Abel...Where did Abel go? To Hell! That blood...! "Hell"? What's that? Where is it? You mean...! I killed him out of jealousy! He took all our love away from me! Damn you, Abel! Damn you! Why..why is it Abel? Why does my heart hurt this much? Why does my heart ache? You can't repay by your death. You most be in agony. You killed my child! Mother..I..I just.. Stop whining! Even if God will, I won't forgive you! Cain, I will watch you until the day you die. Won't let you kill my children! This is... The first murder of mankind? Linne Amagane! Now you know what happened! It's horrible! Linne, is that you? It's Mom! Linne, where is this? Tell me, Linne! She's in Hell, means she's dead too. You do understand? Under your hypocritical mask, you want to kill me. I feel your urge to kill! Whatever you say, you're no different, a murdering beast Linne, where is this? Tell her where we are, Linne. What's happening to you guys! Mom was my reason for life. How could you... Why did you kill Mom! I'm dead? That's right. You're dead and in Hell, just like your beloved child. Can't he... I feel so good seeing you in agony. I'm sick of your fancy words. Under your skin, you're like anyone, a blood-thirsty beast! Now choose, Linne Amagane. Do it now! Come on, choose! Enter the gate and vanish to nothing. Or fight against me. Choose one or the other. Damn it! Phantoma, I won't forgive you! You angry? Cool! Love that look on your face! Now show me just how much! Sounded nasty! Don't stand there! Help Linne! I'm fine! Linne... The power of Satan... How lethal... We'll use God's power, Honey! Brought me here for this, right God? I need your help, Honey! But how? It's simple. Just wish that I'll heat her. Damn it! Let go! Nope! Trust yourself, Honey. Your wish is my source of power. Let me explain. If Honey doubts, my power weakens. Because Linne, you're the reincarnation of Eve. God created Eve from a part of me. Two people make one! Slow down, I... Don't lovey-dovey in front of me! Unacceptable! Mom! Hey! Keep on going, and they'll vanish! Stealer! Christ! No way will I vanish! Good job, Phantoma! Shut up, you crook! And you're not? Using a monster! Linne Amagane! Come up here and fight! Phantoma, you realize what you're doing? You and your idealistic words! Be vanished! Still want to lecture me? That gets on my nerve, you stupid fool! Stupid fool... I was one too in my previous life... A friend I trusted asked for the man I loved so dearly, and I consented. She still suspected I was having affairs with him and killed me. A fool I was letting her have my love out of fake kindness, and her who killed me. When I was sent to Hell, Master Abel gave me the only kindness. That's why... Why I devote everything to Master Abel! He's everything to me! Don't care about the rest! All shall vanish as what Master Abel desires! How dare you! You have something to protect! Your Pres. Kutou! That is your source of energy! That gives you hope! You and I, we're the same! The same? "Hope"? Is that a joke? That's just 9:1 . Life is 90" unhappiness, 10" happiness. It's only a tenth. That's the most you'll get. Pres. Kutou...? - Look at you, my son... - Master Abel...! That's not true. No, that's what's important! What's that, Mom? You denying what I'm saying? We're not always happy, hut we get greater happiness out of it! Mother... Mother, your strong determination and hope may save... this Hell and my brother Abel. I don't know the ratio 9:1, hut... Happiness and unhappiness are both important! Pres. Kutou must have had happy times! Happiness...? Then what is your definition of happiness! Hang out with friends. Have crush on boys. You grew up loved... That's why... That's why I feel 100" happy! But that's only if you're saved after your hardship... I was murdered before I got a chance... I expected Mom's soul will yield by bringing your mom to Hell. Guess that's not enough. You can try out 100" unhappiness. Right, Phantoma? Linne, you are my pride. I am so grateful you are my child. People call it desperation. Goodbye, Linne... This is just... Can Linne withstand the loss of her mother? Mom... Mom...! Abel! No, Kutou! Come down here! I'll kill you! Stop whining about yourself! You've no right to make others suffer! Stop your illogical nonsense! That's not funny! I'm saving others. Telling people how unfortunate that mankind exists. Enlightening them! Hey, Linne...! Honey, what are you...? Good, enter into the darkness I created in despair. Vanish like Mom's mom. I'm coming, Mom! Stop! You fool! I lost Kutou. Luca and Rei are gone too! If you vanish too, what'll I do? Can't lose any more friends! Linne! You mustn't! Mom! VANISH! ! LINNE... Linne! You fool! Amazing! Beat the monster with one blow! Damn it! Dammit! Linne is... Mom...Mom... "Linne, you are my pride." "I am so grateful you are my child." Mom loved me... She just loved me... I was blind to her kindness, her warmth... I'm sorry. Mom... I'm a fool... I...who am I? Where...where am I? Right, the darkness. Stealer's world of nothingness. Nothingness? This is "nothingness" This isn't nothingness. I am here! I am Linne Amagane. I won't be fooled! Mom! Rei! Luca too! And everyone! ! Linne, thank you. I heard your words. That's how I'm here. I can tell. And her too... What? Who? Stealer! I don't want...anymore... I'm the darkness Abel created. But don't want that anymore. I was scared when I met you. Things happened, and I wanted to be with you. I have nothing... Can't do anything, hut... Since I'm the darkness. But you're here Linne, that's why I'm here. Stealer was always with me, since we first met. And we'll always be together! Yeah, I'm not darkness. I'm not alone! I'm...no longer... What the...? What's going on? Damn it! What? The light is retreating! Let's go, Stealer! Yeah. Why? Why won't you...vanish? Go...Go away! What are you? It's me, Linne. Come on, Phantoma. A date with Pres. Kutou! A date? - Hurry up, Phantoma! - What are you talking about? But Stealer...! A date with Pres. Kutou. Why! Oh, salty! Created an ocean in Abel's Hell, Honey? Look at her... Oh, Phantoma... Linne! It's you, Linne! Wait...that hurts! You fool! Don't ever do that again! Hey, she's my wife! Not in this life! Mario! Mario! How nice! Forgot us already? Thought you guys vanished! But we're here, Mario! Not only us. Look over there! What the... Can it be for real? Impossible! Strong determination! That's my mom, hut... Fine, I'll...! I...I'm...! I'm absolutely touched! Oh my...! How amazing Linne's power is... Your right hand is real? Yeah, thought I'll be all right. I believed, so it healed. Think I'm back since I believed "nothingness" doesn't exist. Or rather wished... Think that's why... Wait, just "wished"? Can't be that easy! You're saying mine will grow back if I wish? Don't hark at her. Then Mario... How did your one blow heat Phantoma's monster? I don't know. Mere luck? Wrong! You didn't doubt that you'll heat that monster. You believed, so it happened. If so...only one thing we must do. Wish that we can end this mess. Believe we can... Just wish? Won't happen that easily! Imagine to... Create! Believe and do not doubt! BELIEVE! NEVER DOUBT! IMAGINE TO CREATE... "Imagine to create..." IT WILL HAPPEN! IT WILL HAPPEN! Mom, you"e amazing,.. This voice! - Forget it! - Pres. Kutou! Wanted you all vanished, hut will let those who wish return. But let's spice it up! How about a life-or-death toss hall? Toss hall? What's that? I got no hall. It's your will. Each of you... Your will in the form of a hall. Something you've forgotten. If you get it in, I'll bring you back to life. And if I fail? What then? You stay here! And I'll see you vanish in Hell with my own hands! So now choose! Back to life or vanish! Bravo, Mom! Your turn, Pres. Kutou. Let's go back to our present lives! If you want to go back, hurry up! No! I can't! I'm fine... I sure won't make it! Impossible! Cowards! We all must! No other way out! We make it, we go back! So throw the hall! I'll throw mine! It's all up to me! Do it, Mario! I'm throwing mine! Here I come! There! Missed! Mario! Your hand...it's...! Can't he! Stop! Damn it! It's up to me, right? "Up to me"? If that's up to you, then this world is all up to me! Wish? Believe? Things won't happen like that, Mario. Many wishes, only one world. Only one! If this world is up to Mario, it's up to me too! Get it? The strength of one's will rules the world. So much for "wishing"! "Believing"! That's only the beginning! From such height! You still don't get it, Mario! This is reality. It's up to you as much as up to me. It's our reality! You're too dense! Easy to dream and wish for a bright future! But how you attain your goal is the most important, difficult part! People work hard for the same goal. They compete on same grounds! Everyone competes to become first! There are winners and losers... I'm... Wishing alone won't make you a winner! Think you're so special, don't you? On what grounds! I've been rotting away in Hell like a zombie... But thought I was saved when I met you! I didn't know what to do in this world! Nothing to live for! But you saved me! You told me! This mess is because Helvis broke the cycle of reincarnation! We were dragged into it while still alive! You told me! The brothers' grudges! The first murder of mankind! If we heat Helvis who broke the cycle, we can go back! I needed friends... I needed your power... I did. You say "friends"? You used Luca, Rei and me so that Helvis won't attack! What friends! It's all a lie! You cold-blooded beast! You're no human! Dependency, betrayal, excuses... That's what humans are. Nothing more. Humans live a meaningless life and die. Nothing more... Stop fighting for nothing, Mario. How pitiful! How dare you! What did you wish for? Hate gives you great power. Like your hatred toward me giving you a hand. Despite all the pretty words, that's just human. Mankind are worthless. Why fight for them? Shut up! You piss me off! But more pissed with myself for trusting you! I see it now! Might be too late, hut... Never too late, Mario! Here... Linne! Now that you see, I feel like giving you a hand. Won't let you have it your way! Really? How? Mario, there's nothing you can change. A nobody like you, Mario! What can you possibly do! What do I have? I...what do I? Kutou! Stop it now, fool! Hey! You fool! How's that feel? Huh? Pain is only weakness. Cut it out, Kutou! Where's the Kutou I know! It's time you see reality! Who cares? Damn it! My hand hurts like hell! You must feel the pain, hut I feel it a billion times more! Over here! I don't know why, hut it hurts here! So cut it out! Abel... You're lucky. You've a great friend. You twisted punk! Your rules will never change, will it? You just amaze me! Watch this! - He'll fall! - Hold on! I won't follow Abel's rules anymore! This is my rule! How we get what we want! Throw it in and we go back! No way anyone will miss! Throw the hall? Go back? We can? Like that, I might... You all, let's go! Let's teach Abel a lesson! Throw it! It's not looking good... Right! This is how it should be! You arrogant punk! What is this? Is this "pain"? Dammit! I can't? Can't make a difference? You gave me pain! I'll eliminate you! Goodbye, Mario! Goodbye? That's just perfect! So this is the end? The end? It's all over? Don't give up! What? Who is it? Mario, you fool! Mustn't give up! How reckless she is... There's nothing to worry about. With the strength to protect herself, she can others. Since she's my previous... Previous lifetime's wife. Who told me I can't protect others when I can't protect myself. Thought he was mean, hut I get it now. Yeah, I get it now too! Sorry I was being reckless, hut I realized something. You told me not to give up. I then realized how we can change this Abel's world! Linne... You knew? Yeah! We need everyone's help! Everyone's will! Yeah, that's right! Let's all go home! Yeah! Yeah! ! So... Miss Linne, how do we change Abel's world? It's more like Hell doesn't exist. But it's right here! This is merely Abel's imagination. Abel's imagination? That's right. Think hard what happened so far. Darkness is gone, Linne created ocean and my right hand is back. That's true... That's because we escaped the images in Abel...Kutou's head. We were just trapped in his world. This Hell we've been in doesn't really exist! But we're dead. Don't the dead normally go to Heaven or Hell? "Normally"... How can everyone imagine Heaven or Hell without seeing one? Why do people accept being put in Hell? Because Abel has nurtured such images in people through religion and art. So we were merely Abel's puppets. But that ends today. Mario...! Your game is over, you crybaby! We'll see! We...People... Live as we desire! Just as we feel! We did it! Really did it! Hell is really gone! But how do we go back home? The city! It was here? We can go back! I want to go home... But we can't...? No, Luca. Over here! Look up at the sky! That's where we're going! Let's go! Linne! Why's she flying? Are those wings? Yeah, those are! For sure! I see them! They're wings, Linne! You're my angel! Let's all go! We'll go with Linne! We can all go home! Pres. Kutou too! Pres. Kutou! Why is he smiling? - I'm scared! - So high up! What am I doing? Guys, don't give up! Guys! Easier said than done. Cowards! We made Hell disappear! Don't get negative images! Trust yourselves! You, Pandas! You tell them too! Now! I won't be able to... I WON'T BE ABLE TO... Who'll take responsibility? That's reckless... It's too much... Impossible! I'm exhausted... Pres. Kutou, what are you... This is... What the hell is that? Is this all your doing? Good guess, Mario! The real end for all of you! You all, are you ready? Everyone! The beginning of the end! In this world, both positive and negative thoughts will be materialized! The sense of guilt you've spoken gave them power! Giving excuses instead of cooperating! This is the real human nature! Be destroyed by your own sense of guilt! Let go of me! Stop it! Why try to help me? Amends for murdering me? Or because I'm your brother? Oh my...! Hey Lock! What's down there? Can it he...? Can't he! Lock is God, isn't he? What'll happen now? Lock...God has... Headmaster Helvis, what will... Can't tell anymore... God is dead! That's for sure! Stealer! Hang on, Stealer! You did it, Stealer! Let's go back together! Linne... "Hang on..." That's right! That's all we've got. We'll never surrender! This is it! Positive thinking! - This is it! - Yeah! We'll make it! There's no point... Surely impossible... Look at that, Cain. Humans are stupid. They're hopeless. Always bringing disaster upon themselves. Abel, you fool! This world is up to us! If we strongly wish, believe, we can overcome all hardships. Abel, don't you give up hope! You're the fool, Cain. This is my wish. I wished this to happen. It's all over now... Only one thing... Termination of mankind... I regret not being able to witness that... No...I... What has happened to me? Stop! What is this feeling...? No! I don't want to die! There! You're safe up here! Great! Let go! Let me die, Mario! I do what I want! Why do you care, Mario? I don't know why, hut just don't want to lose you! Leave me alone! Never asked for help! What? Then what's this, Kutou? Your hand gripping tight onto my arm! This is your true desire! Isn't it, Kutou? You want to live! Want to remain as yourself! Nothing wrong with that. Hight, Kutou? USELESS! I...I... Hey you! Well, I... DEATH! Pres. Kutou, I'm glad. NO MORE! VANISH! Hey Kutou! Get on your feet! Well, I... I want to live... I want to live more! Pillars of light! They are...! Only one way to go back to the living, baby! Follow those three pillars of light! Cross the Death River, baby! Death Hiver! Let's go! Let's go home! IMPOSSIBLE! - No way we'll lose! - No way! You alone... Want to be saved...? That's not fair! Kutou! - Stop, Kiki! - You're right, Kiki... No way this will be allowed... Not fair! No way this will be forgiven! Stop, Kiki! Kiki, come on! It's me! It's Linne! Don't you see? Kutou, get up! It's not...not fair! Hey Linne! Why's it crying? Kiki's just scared... Can't control her own body... Looks different, hut... Linne! Behind you! This is Kiki! Not an enemy! LOVE The path to the Death Hiver! Keep going straight! But... Trust me! But... What if... Oh no...Linne! Trust yourselves! Linne! Everyone, stop! It's me, Linne! What...? Stealer! Stealer! Get out of there! You can't stay there! Stealer! Talk to me! I'm back to myself! The 7 sins are gone! Everything's fine now! Stealer told me... "Leave it up to me." Sorry Stealer... Sorry... Stealer told me... "Leave it up to me." "So Linne must go back home with your mom and everyone." No way I can do that! No way I can leave Stealer behind! Stealer! Stealer, you liar! You said we'll always be together! Answer me, Stealer! Talk to me! Please! Where are you going! Stealer saved you guys! We're...going home! Stealer sacrificed herself for us! Look at her! We must bring her back to herself! Impossible. What! However hard we may try, we can't... "We"? Did you say "we"? Who are you talking about? Don't make excuses, coward! Mario, we listened to you! We failed! You...! I'm done listening to you! Won't you now? What's wrong going home! Stealer's choice, not ours! We shan't survive? Back off! You're no human! This is why we can't live in peace! Why are they fighting? I've had enough... Miss Amagane... Bring Stealer back! This world is no longer my own. Miss Amagane, sorry hut... But that's...! I made Stealer in this world, and brought you here. I'm all to blame. It's not my place to say, hut... you should listen to Stealer's wish and go home. I can't do that! I can't... I'll try to forgive my brother too. For my brother and me. "Brother"? He called me "brother"! Just cry... Cry when you want, like any human. It's no time to be crying... I've taught them wishes will come true. When knowing they don't always. But everything starts by wishing! That's why I won't stop saying! You're right. We must trust them. Come, Miss Amagane... No... I don't want to leave Stealer! I feel like I accomplished something because you were with me. I'm satisfied, Linne, so... I'm no longer "nothing"... Thank you, Linne... So don't cry for me. I'm with you, Linne. With you forever... Sorry! I'm sorry...! Hey, you heard that? Yeah, heard their voices clearly. Come, Miss Amagane... No, I'm not going back! Why do they fight? In the world Stealer died to protect! I can't go back like this. Stealer told me... "Not all wishes come true, hut the feeling gets across." Thank you, Stealer. I get it now. What you said. We'll think about it. Let's learn again. We'll do it! Again! We'll rebuild the Academy! Many things happened this time. Why did it happen? We must continue thinking about that For that, we must learn. For that reason, my stupid son... DEATH RIVEH ACADEMY We did it, Stealer! It's all thanks to you! I can't move... Overworked... Tired... We wished for one thing, and it came true! This is awesome, right, Stealer? No more regrets, right? Right. Linne Amagane... You're graduating, baby! That means Linne will go... Go home? Linne! Linne! Can't get in unless I graduate? Ma...Mario! You're going now, damn it! Linne! Cheer up! That's not like you! Listen, I... I love... I love you! Linne! You won't remember about Hell when you go home. But your feelings will remain in your heart. That's what humans are! Thank you, Linne! You're back, Linne. I'm home, Mom. Linne! You're late for school! Nooooooo! I'm running late! Friends at Death River Academy please protect my girl, Linne. Not again! I'll make it in time today! Ouch...that hurt! Hurry up, Linne! Look there! How dangerous! A girl! Good, you're not hurt. Great to help others, hut watch for yourself! Here, she's all yours. You've got guts. Ciao! That's...? Big sister, thank you! Oh, right. I'll walk you to school, Stealer! I'm Hiroko Yano. Who is Stealer? Where do people go when they die? They all go to Hell! What do they do in Hell? They study for their next life! Study what? Thinking about that is the first step! Don't worry! There's tons of things to study! What's wrong, big sister? It's just that... I feel good all of a sudden. Here. Let's go. GRADUATION
