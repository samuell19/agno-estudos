- Going to Le Havre? - Yeah. get in. Thanks. Tired? Yes. Are you on leave? You're not very talkative. No, not very. Cigarette? Yes. Thanks. We're here. - What? - Le Havre. Ah, yes. Le Havre. This is some fog! I know all about fogs. I was in Tonkin. You must be joking. It's not foggy in Tonkin. Not foggy? Yes, it is. In here. Are you mad, swerving to save a dog? - A dog's a dog. - And my bones are my bones. Got yellow fever? Then take quinine. You might be in the army but I'm the boss in my truck. Your truck, your bones! If you don't like it, get out and I'll rattle those bones of yours. All right, I will. Are we really going to fight over a dog? Don't think I'm chickening out. I could easily take a hold of you and head-butt you. So much for your spanner! I only grabbed it in case you tried to shoot. Shoot? You don't know what you're talking about. Give me a cigarette. Shooting might look easy. Like shooting clay pipes at the fair. You shoot and then... a man screams and grabs hold of his belly, making a face like... Like a kid who's eaten too much. His hands turn red. Then he falls. And you're left all alone, not understanding a thing. It's as if the ground had fallen away. Right. Anyway... Thanks for the lift. Here. No hard feelings? Of course not. - Bye. - Want the packet? - What about you? - I've got more. Well, in that case... - Thanks. - Bye. Good luck. It's a laugh a minute tonight. - Will he be long? - I don't know. You never know anything. Coming to dance, Lucien? I told you to wait at the bar. We're talking. I came here because you asked me to but I hate places like this. I find this music so dreadful. I like classical music. We know what kind of music you like, Zabel. You know nothing. You're just petty crooks. That's right, make us laugh. Act the fool. Funny, isn't he? Sure, if you say so. You even make the orphan laugh. And he's not normally cheerful. You make us laugh. It's a fact. You can pretend to laugh but you should be ashamed of the life you lead. Your parents are respectable people. But you lead the life of a gangster. It's so demoralising. And to think you learned to play the piano! Listen, it's all very well acting the fool for five minutes, but enough's enough. Where's Maurice? Yes, good old Maurice! No idea. He used to drop in once in a while. But once I saw he was a crook like you, I asked him to space out his visits. That's all. This music! Maurice has disappeared and since I've fallen out with him... - Over a woman, no doubt. - That or something else. Anyway, people think I'm involved. And deep down that flatters you, right? But you're worried it might cause you trouble so you'd like to know. Precisely. I'm sure you know a lot. Yes, a lot! You're wrong, my dears. I don't know a thing. And don't get so familiar. I'm old enough to be your father and I'm an honest merchant. We're pretty rare these days. You invited me here so I'll let you pay. Madam, my hat and coat, please. He makes fun of us and then off he goes! Let him go. We'll go and see him later. What for? Just to see. I told you to get lost! Can't you be polite? I'm asking you how much the rooms cost? You're dressed up like an admiral so you can help the customers. Just tell me what the rooms cost. I'm telling you, this is not a hotel! So you won't say what the rooms cost? It's not for tonight because I'm skint. But maybe tomorrow or another night I could... Get lost or this could turn nasty! - Sorry. - No harm done. - What a brute! - Who? - The admiral. - Leave me in peace. I'm in a hurry. But it's not every night I meet a friend. I don't love soldiers. I just feel sorry for them. I might have been a soldier if I hadn't come a cropper the day I got called up. - Are you going to leave me alone? - Are you a brute too? No, I just want to be left alone. Now I see. I get it. Do you have to be so clingy? - Is that your dog? - No. If you're looking for a quiet spot, I might be able to help you. The trouble is, I'm skint. That doesn't matter. I'll take you to Panama's. - What's Panama's? - Panama's? It's the quietest spot on the coast. For a seaside resort, it's the best you can find. Four walls, a door and a roof on top. My dream is... If you dream standing up, you'll fall over. Never mind. Here we are. It's that place lit up over there. My dream is to sleep just once between clean, white sheets. A top sheet and a bottom sheet. Your dog's back. I told you, he's not mine. Get lost, will you? I've got no dog, nothing. Don't you like dogs? Not one that's looking for a master. Have you found a master? Not yet. - Who is it? - Half Pint. Open up. I'm not alone. Come in. Good evening. Want a drink? I'm not thirsty. I just need some rest. Besides, I can't afford a drink. That doesn't matter. Make yourself at home. But I'm warning you, don't try telling me some sob story about the fog, your troubles and your problems. There's no fog here, only fair weather. The hands are nailed down, so... any personal stuff... Calm down. I'm not the talkative type. Well, I am, but I'm discreet. What do you think of this one? It's a real one. I bought it in Panama, in 1906. Panama! It cuts America in half. You cross it by boat and you're down below looking up at monkeys in the sky. Blue monkeys. It's wonderful. - Tired? - A little. Forgive me. Tired or not, it's none of my business. Usually, I never ask questions. No harm done. Leave that alone, you idiot! The crew will come unglued. You've already swallowed the cabin boy. Panama, 1906. 32 years in the bottle and you want to gulp it down! When I'm thirsty... Hell, all I want is... I know. To sleep in clean sheets. - Hi, Panama. - Michel. You've got a crowd in tonight. Yeah, high society! People are what they are. Pretty awful, pretty criminal. But there are pretty things too. You should paint them. Paint them? I've tried painting flowers, young women, children... It was like painting crime with all that entails. I'd see crime in a rose. It's called painting with a knife! What could be simpler than a tree? And yet when I paint one, I make everyone ill at ease. There's always something or someone hidden behind the tree. I paint things hidden behind other things. To me, a swimmer is already a drowned man. Whenever I try to paint gaiety, music, a dance or an outdoor wedding, on my canvas I find only hatred, jealousy, murder and cemeteries. Still lives! Be quiet, you idiot! No, I'm the idiot. Only an idiot can live this way with such anguish. Don't you think so? I think you're complicated. Yes. But... Things will work out. I've come full circle. Are you still considering suicide? Some people go fishing some go hunting, some go to war. Others commit crimes of passion. And some commit suicide. You have to kill someone. That's life for you! Take your drinking, for instance, you drink to kill the pain. Me? I drink to get drunk. It amounts to the same thing. As for you, I'm sure that if I did your portrait... Leave me alone! Your hands in your pockets, at night in the fog... I've had enough of this! You and your fancy talk! It's getting on my nerves. - Have you been drinking too? - Shut up. What do you know? I get upset and you insist that I've been drinking. I haven't. I just haven't eaten for two days. There's a sign on my belly that says "cold storage". Didn't they feed you in the army? What's it to you? You should have said you were hungry. It's not hard. I know. When you're hungry you ask for food. Only I shut up out of pride. I'm proud. Funny, that. People say I'm headstrong. They're right. I am headstrong. And you're hard-headed too! You said you were hungry. - I am. - Come on, then. There's bread, sausage and some Chester cheese. In Panama I always bought Chester. If you haven't eaten for a while, you should eat slowly. Aren't you going to tell me to enjoy my food? Have you forgotten your manners? You again! Perhaps you're hungry too. - Is he yours? - Yes. He's got a nice face. So have you. You're pretty and I like you. I mean it. You're skinny but I like you. It's like in the movies, I see you and I like you. It's love at first sight. I'm love-struck. You know that little chap with wings on his back and arrows? Hearts on trees. Romance that ends in tears. You girls! You're all the same. You play dirty tricks on us. Do you really think that? What? What you say about love. You girls are all the same. You tout your wares, but really you're after romance. What did you say? We tout our wares? Yes. Have you never heard the expression before? You tout your wares, you hustle. Why do you talk to me like that? Come off it! Don't tell me you came here to bring your granny a cake, like Little Red Riding Hood. Pity, because... I'm the big bad wolf. And the big bad wolf is not very clever. Do you think khaki suits me? Tell me... Why do you keep laughing like that? It's not a real laugh. It's sad. Have you ever seen a woman fall in love with a soldier? Women love a soldier when he's on parade. But when a uniformed soldier shows up on his own, you should see the look on their faces then. I don't even know why I'm telling you this. Men and women can't get along. They don't speak the same language. They don't use the same vocabulary. Maybe so, but they can still love one another. Have you ever loved anyone? - Not really. - Well, then? What's that? I don't know. - What was that? - Just some bad boys. I picked a quiet spot to get away from them and they come here to kill one another. Your lighting is like the catacombs. - Well? - Well! Most unfortunate. How could you lose him? He'll be hiding in that shack. - What shack? - The bar over there. That dump? Get in! I'm sure he's here. Then let's go and get him. Open up. We're dying of thirst. We're closed. If you don't open up, we'll come in anyway. - Shall we bash the door in? - First warning shot. Fired in the air, like in Panama. The next one's for you. They're going to shoot. Are you afraid of the gunfire? - I wish that was all. - What else is there? I can't tell you. Don't be afraid. I'm here. You're sweet. What's your name? Nelly. I'm Jean. The bastards! A real naval battle! Wonderful! The captain's all alone on board. I think they got the message. What a lovely night! Indeed. Hey! This looks like blood. Blood? What are you doing there? Are you wounded? I must have cut my hand when I fell. May I come in? Come in. Life is a curious thing, at least what you see of it between midnight and 3am. That man mustn't see me here. I don't want too many people to see me either. They were after me like a pack of wolves. I got away but it was a close call. - give me some rum, boss. - There's no rum here. But you can wash your hands. Ah, yes, my hands. Blood stains clothes but it washes off hands easily. Have you ever noticed how doctors, surgeons in particular, have white, well-kept hands? Yet they paddle in blood all day long. I'm not a doctor. I sell cut-price trinkets. Nobody asked you what you did. There's some rainwater outside in the bucket. As you wish. Are you an artist? I wish I was. I love the arts. Classical music, especially religious music. It brings back memories. I love sifting through my memories. Family memories, childhood memories. Where's your wound? I can't see it. I must have been mistaken. And now I've lost my parcel. My parcel. That is upsetting. So that wasn't your blood? I don't know who you are. It's none of my business. It's dawn. You can go now. You've got a face I don't like. Some faces are likeable, some aren't. It's unimportant. A face doesn't amount to much. It carries so little weight. Mine pleases nobody, but believe it or not, when I look in a mirror, I like it. Better to have this face than none at all, right? Each time the sun rises, we think something new will happen, something fresh. Then the sun goes to bed and so do we. It's sad. Did you mean what you said earlier? What? About love. I wouldn't have said it otherwise. You might have said it to soften up a customer. A customer? Sorry to disturb you. Nothing like a cold shower to perk a fellow up. Now I'm fresh as a daisy and ready for work. You work? Yes, down at the docks. This holds two litres. Each morning I swipe two litres to sell at night. It's illegal, of course, but I'm the only one who recorks the barrel. It's a simple question of professional honesty. Bye, then. Excuse me, lovely lady, but work is work. Staying here? No. Where are you going? - I don't know. - We're going the same way, then. Do you like life? - What? - You like life, don't you? Yes, on certain days. Does life like you? So far it's been pretty mean, but... that may change since I like it. Thanks for your hospitality. You've been great. Thank you for keeping me company. If I can help in any way... Help me? Perhaps you could find me some civvies. I see. So you're on permanent leave? - I thought you didn't ask questions. - Don't you trust me? - Yes, but... - This is my only suit and I like it. Come back tonight and I might have something. Thanks. I will. What's your shoe size? - Seven and a half. Why? - No reason. Coming? Sometimes luck strikes. Luck? He's a seven and a half, like me. He needs clothes, I have some. He wants a new life, but... he needs a pass. Yes, he needs a new identity. That's obvious. He's in luck. I have one going spare. - Oh? - My own. If he can use it... I'm going swimming. The sea's rough and it's foggy. What? I'm just stating the facts. The sea is rough and it's foggy. And that's fine by me. I swim pretty badly. Even so, I'm going to swim out as far as possible. What do you want me to say? - Nothing. - OK. Michel! Don't do anything stupid. What good will it do? What a fog! What awful weather! Shoes. Bottle tops, an old comb. The seabed's vast. That's not the seabed. The seabed's further out and deeper. You talk like a deep-sea diver. - How old are you? - 17. Me too... I was 17 once. - That's funny. - What? - Look at Nelly. - Where? There, with a soldier. Curious. - I thought we were going for coffee? - We're going to have some fun. I'm going to Panama's tonight. Come along. I will if I can. Got any money? - Why? Do you want some? - You don't have any. Yesterday you were hungry. Why do you ask, then? Hi. Come here a minute. What do you want? Nothing. We were just passing. I came over to say hello. And to ask for news of Maurice. - You must know something. - I know nothing. Leave me alone. I see you've already forgotten Maurice and found a replacement? Great. You'll go out with anybody but you turn me down. Why? I think you're pretty. You've got a pretty mouth. - I like it. - Don't touch me! You don't want to be touched? Did Maurice never touch you? What about the others? What about him? Everybody except me! Leave me alone. Instead of hanging out at the Petit Tabarin, you should stay in the shop with your guardian. By the way, when you see Zabel, tell him from me that last night's fun was just a warning. That business disgusts me. Do I disgust you too? You too. You especially. - Me especially, eh? - Leave me alone. I said, leave me alone! Leave her alone like she asked you to. Take my advice, go and toss some stones in the water. You soldiers are easily pleased. You spit in the water and you're happy as Larry. You can still leave her alone. He's the calm type. A master of self-control. There are three of us and you're on your own. Three? Can't you count? You must be counting on the big man because you two don't amount to much. - Whatever. Come with me. - Leave her alone! A simple soldier dishing out orders? Get lost, will you? Sorry, I'm a bit rough. It was just a joke. Leaving, are you? In a hurry now? Stay away from me. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. I'm warning you... Watch it! Watch what? Lost your nerve all of a sudden, have you? You've turned pale. You don't look too good. Next time you see me coming, I suggest you cross the street. Otherwise you'll have this coming to you. Come on! Are you getting in or not? Lucien looks like he's going to cry. So much for having fun! Why did you do that? You don't know if I'm worth it. I thought you were in a hurry. I don't know. I ran away. If I go back, it will be awful. If I don't, it will be the same. I should go back too. But if I did, like you say, it would be awful. Goodbye, Jean. I'll come to Panama's tonight if I can. Goodbye. Nelly? It's me. Listen. It's beautiful. Shut up! You make fun of all that is fine and beautiful. You've laughed at us enough. It's over. Are you drunk or on drugs? I'm sick of being humiliated. I'm a man. Do you hear me? I'm a man and I'll prove it. Right now! Put that away. We came here to talk. Reckless youth! Give me the papers, all of them. Tell us where Maurice is. I bet you've bumped him off. What a thing to say. What were you doing down by the water with those parcels? - Answer me, or else... - Or else what? I'll show you who I am. I'll prove to you that I'm somebody. I know who you are. You're Lucien Lagardier, from a fine family but ill-bred. Too much pocket money and yet never enough. You struck some deals and got into trouble so you came to old Zabel to ask him to bail you out. You're an ungrateful boy. I've helped you out before. Last night you tried to run me over and shoot me. I don't know where Maurice is. But the papers concerning you are in safe keeping. Were it god's will for me to die a violent death, you would all be in big trouble. You came here to scare me and you haven't succeeded. It's true. They came here to scare me. To scare me! You little worms! Don't you realise I can't even scare myself? Shut him up! Shut him up or I'll kill him. I'll shoot you, I swear it. What good would that do? - Let me go. - Come on. Go out the back way. - One day I'll prove I'm somebody. - What's got into him? A soldier taught him a lesson earlier. It was about Nelly. - Really? - Lucien tried to talk to her. The soldier punched Babe and slapped Lucien. What did Lucien do? - Nothing. - Nothing? These soldiers are admirable. Why are you telling me this? Lucien is your friend. Friends come and go. - Expecting someone for lunch? - Yes, my goddaughter. Think she'll come back? She always comes back. Here she is now. go. Goodbye. You fly off like a swallow. You desert your old guardian. You leave him all alone, worried sick. Why did you run off the other night? I was scared. You're such a baby. Why come back, then? The others scare me too. Where else can I go? Don't you like it here? Aren't I good to you? You're still a little girl and yet you're a little lady too. Don't look at me like that! Where were you last night? Nowhere. I went for a walk. And found a regiment. Soldiers are handsome, aren't they? Is it sailing soon? - Tomorrow. - Where to? Venezuela, I think. Venezuela? Want something? No, just looking. Stay there. You must be tired. Can I help you? I'd like the little box in the window. I'd like "Jean and Nelly" engraved on it. And today's date. Jean and Nelly? That's nice. It's good to be sentimental. People are so hard-hearted these days. Nelly? This man has a gift for you. I'll make you a gift of your gift to Nelly. Any friend of my goddaughter's is a friend of mine. Do you like animals? They don't like me much. - May I help you? - We'd like some postcards. Did you follow me here? No. I looked in the window and came in. Why did you want to buy me a souvenir? To get rid of some spare cash. I don't accept money from women. Men, women, what difference does it make? Sorry. Business is business. I hope you'll have coffee with us. - No, thanks. I have to... - Please. Such politeness in a soldier is unheard of. Come along. I suppose you're on leave. You're not from round here. I bet you're from Paris. - Yes. - That's obvious. - Sit down. - Thanks. Everyone's welcome here. Are you here to see family? Nelly, fetch a bottle of cognac from the cellar. She's a nice girl, isn't she? She runs away from time to time, but it's nothing serious. Her mother was like that too. Short escapades but nothing serious. Then one day she left and never came back. The girl stayed with her father. He was a fine man but he died. More coffee? It's better than your average cup. Do you like the army? I get to travel. - Have you been in Le Havre long? - Since yesterday. Pretty town, isn't it? Nelly, what is it? Nelly! Don't touch me. Leave me alone! I need to talk to you. What do you want from him? You have a fever. Come and lie down. I'll take you to your room. She's so sensitive. The slightest thing upsets her. You were at Panama's last night. What of it? I didn't see you but I saw your dog. He growled at me. Nelly was there too, wasn't she? I don't answer questions I don't like. No one who spends the night there has a clear conscience. Really? That goes for me as well as you. Do you have a good memory for numbers? I do. Take this number, for example. 36-14. I only saw it once but I remember it. What? It's your army serial number. I saw it on your shirt earlier. So? So what? So this. I'm very discreet about people who do me a favour. And people who don't? That depends. You did me a favour without knowing it. By slapping Lucien Lagardier. - Who? - This morning down by the docks. I'm well informed. What I don't see, I guess. You didn't come to Le Havre by chance. That's none of your business. Perhaps, but I'm interested. You came here because of the ships. You're in trouble and you want to leave in search of a new life. I can help you leave. I don't want anything. I have money if you want. I can get you ID, a passport. Lucien Lagardier is an immoral good-for-nothing. He's threatening me and he'll stop at nothing. So? I do you a favour, you do me one. Everyone's happy. At night Lucien goes down by the water. You're there. You push him. He falls in. Child's play! Whenever a rogue disappears, society breathes a little easier. Think it over. Is that right? I've thought it over. Listen... In Tonkin I once saw a limp, gooey bug. Just seeing it wiggle made me want to puke. It was a scolopendra. You remind me of it, with your slimy voice. You sound as if you're wading through slime. My voice is odd but so are you. I am the way I am. I've only ever stepped out of line when I've been angry. Whenever anything good happens, scum like you come and mess it up. You disgust me but I don't like squashing bugs. Come on. Jean! I was watching. Jean, be careful. - Of your guardian? - Yes. I can see why you want to get out of that place. Can I see you tonight? - Where? - Anywhere. The fair on the dock. - Fairs are big places. - This is a small one. I'll meet you at the carousel with the white rabbits. - What time? - Nine. This is some pair of shoes! So that's why he asked my size. And I yelled at the poor man. It's a shame he left before I could thank him. Do you know where he went? People come and go. We're all just passing through. All the same, I feel lucky. I'm not normally so lucky but today... I'm a lucky devil. Funny how light a hat can feel when you're not used to it. It's so light. The trousers are a bit tight but... They have side tabs. I can adjust them. Nice cloth. He must be rich to give these away. No doubt. He left this for you too. Money? 850 francs. - 850? - And that's not all. A passport. - What for? - He thought you might need it. He thought... I didn't ask for anything. How did he guess? Guess what? That I wanted to leave. What about him? He won't be needing it. - Really? - He's not bothered. So if it will help you... Michel Kraus. Height: 5'8. Medium-sized nose, brown hair. Funny how all men look alike on paper. - You'll have to change the picture. - That's easily done. And fix the stamp and the signature. That's easy too. Here... If no one has come for this in a year and a day, it's yours. Thanks. I'm no good with words, so... Come on. Don't forget your paint box. Your name's Michel Kraus and you're an artist. Yes. That's right. - goodbye. - goodbye. - When do you sail? - Tomorrow at five. - For Venezuela? - Yes. Pretty, isn't it? The ships, the sea, the sailors... Everything's pretty to an artist. I've been watching you. It's easy to spot a painter's eye. I was almost a painter myself. I had paint in my blood. Then I did a medical degree. Utter madness. You're looking at the doctor in spite of himself! Dr. Mollet, doctor on board the Louisiana. Michel Kraus. - Will you have a drink with me? - I'm in a hurry. I have a lot to do too. I sail tomorrow but I still have time for a drink. - You sail tomorrow? - For Venezuela. Come along if you like. She's a good ship. You'd be comfortable. For a painter travel is a source of renewal. - Do you take passengers? - Seriously? You'd really like to come? Why not? There's nothing keeping me here. As long as it's not too expensive. I know you artists aren't wealthy. Come on. Big decisions are best made over a glass of something. Hi! You look happy. good day? You bet! Two litres of the best. - Where are you off to? - Bed. - Hello. - What's it to be? - A room. - A room? Right away. - What about my rum? - Coming right up. - Want something? - No. Yes, give me a shot. - Of what? - A small shot of rum. In a big glass! It's just a formality. You artists are all bohemians. My papers are in order. My passport... Perfect. I'll arrange everything with the captain. You can tell me if you like my watercolours. Watercolours? Are you a landscape painter? I don't go in for theories. You're not a cubist? A cubist? No. Just as well, because I find cubism... What do you paint? In general... I paint things that are hidden behind things. Very interesting. For example, if I see a swimmer, I think he's going to drown. So I paint a drowning man. Your painting doesn't sound very cheerful. As long as it's well painted. Never mind the subject matter. Good health! Boss, another shot to keep these company. Are you going to take that room or not? Ah, yes, the room. - How much is it? - 18 francs. And what do I owe you? 18 francs. I'll pay up, then. - What about the room? - The room? Too late. good night. And be on time. Ships don't wait for you. Do you have much luggage? Very little, just one suitcase. - One suitcase? - Yes. You're leaving for Venezuela with one suitcase? How wonderful! Just as I imagine an artist to be. No baggage, independence, freedom. It's good to be free. Yes, it is. I'm sure you plan to return. I mean... Aren't you involved with anyone? No. No one. Don't move. One... two... three. Thank you. The journey's over so soon. It would be wonderful if we could sail away, the two of us. The two of us... That reminds me. Wait here. I need another picture. - Another one? - Yes, I need another one. To send to a girl? - No. - Really? I said no, didn't I? Do you take passport pictures? There. Isn't that pretty? Maybe, but he looks unhappy. It would be sad to lose him. I'm used to him now, and to you. You're a funny girl. Looking at you or listening to you... makes me want to cry. That shooting is getting on my nerves. - Hungry? - I don't want a thing. I feel good. Really? You feel good with me? You have no idea how good I feel with you. I can breathe. I feel alive. This must be what happiness feels like. If I heard you say that to anyone else, I'd say it was silly. But when you say it to me, it's strange but I like it. You've got pretty eyes. Kiss me. Nelly. Kiss me again. - I'll get the tickets. - There's a queue. A queue? What do you take me for? Excuse me. We're with some ladies. - Six. - You've got a nerve! Hands off! We rule the roost here. Don't make me laugh or my eye-liner will run. - I hate people like that. - People like what? Shut up! Find yourself another one. Watch out for draughts. My hat! What's wrong, Lucien? Are you sick? Watch the dog. I warned you. Come on, Nelly. I'll kill him! Zabel too. I'll shoot them both. You do understand? Of course I understand. Life can be such a bitch. It was deadly at Zabel's, stifling. I'd have gone anywhere. At the Petit Tabarin everyone danced and laughed. Maurice was gentle with me and he said that he loved me. So... I said I loved him too. But it wasn't true. No one really danced or laughed. No one was in love. It was all make-believe. Don't cry. Nelly. When you call me Nelly like that, it's as if I were still a little girl. You haven't grown up all that much. I have. I've grown up too fast and seen too much. I'm damaged. Damaged? Don't be silly. You're the sweetest girl I've ever met. A pretty young girl who loves life is like a man making a bid for freedom. The world is against them. They get hunted down. Living is hard. Yes. We're all alone. At times we meet people we barely know and may never see again. And they help us. We don't know why. It's strange. People love one another. No, they don't. They don't have time for that. I love you, Jean. You talk like a child. I really do love you. Don't leave me. What will I do without you? I'm not going back to Zabel's. I can't live in constant fear. Will you stay a few more days? Who said I was leaving? Seeing you in civvies, I suddenly thought... What difference does it make? Maybe you'll take me with you? Take you with me? Don't you like me? Keep me with you. You're beautiful. - Remember? - What? Last night you woke me and spoke very softly. You said you loved me. I said that? - You must have been dreaming. - Or you were. - Me? - Dreaming out loud. I don't dream. Everyone dreams. - What time is it? - I don't know. Eleven? The sunlight is lovely. Yes. Why are you smiling? I don't know. I thought life was so sad and now... I see that maybe I was wrong so I'm happy. Really? I have to tell you something. It's not very nice. - What is it? - Breakfast. Come in. I brought the newspaper. There's an amazing crime story. The victim wasn't just anybody. He's not very cheery. How many sugars? Two. GRUESOME DISCOVERY The mutilated body of a local man washed up on the quay - How dreadful! - What's wrong? I was right to be afraid. I knew it. I sensed something was going to happen. How dreadful! Well, well. Don't cry. I'm sure the scream I heard that night... It was him. I knew I wasn't dreaming. Don't cry, Nelly. I didn't love him and he hurt me, but that's not a reason to kill him. Why? Do you know who did this? I'm pretty sure I do. Yes? Sorry. I need the tray. The hotel only has two. We've got twelve rooms so it's not easy. You weren't very hungry. Can I take it? Yes, and make it quick. There's quite a crowd on the quay where they found him. And there's more. Apparently, they found a parcel of clothes belonging to a soldier. They say he did it. Maybe he did. Who knows? No, it's not possible. You can't get dragged into this. This or something else. I was about to say something when that idiot came in with the paper, but... It's quite simple. A ship is sailing for Venezuela at four and I plan to be on it. You're leaving me. You must think I'm a bastard. Why? Because I should have told you last night. I saw how happy you were. You were laughing. I wanted you so badly so I said nothing. You were right not to. But it wouldn't have changed anything. Kiss me. I can explain. It's not complicated. - I'm a wanted man. - I don't need to know. You can trust me. I'm not a bad man. Of course you're not because I love you. Anyway, what of it? If you were bad, perhaps I'd love you just the same. Were you sure you'd get away? Everything was set. I thought my luck had changed. They won't find me on the Louisiana. My papers are in order. - Unless... - Unless what? Unless your guardian Zabel... He threatened me. He guessed everything. If he talks, I'm done for. - He won't say anything. - Why? I know what to say to shut him up. Do you think I'm going to let you go back there? I've got nothing to fear. Anyway, what can you do? Nothing. You must go. I've been happy with you. If you're free, I'll still be happy, even if you are far away. - I'll never forget you, Nelly. - Really? Really. If I manage to get away, I'll send for you. I'll come. You're going, I'm going. It's crazy. We were so happy together. You have no idea how much I like you... how much I wanted you last night. And now? Now? I want you like I did last night. Morning, all. Apparently, it was a soldier who did it. - How do you know? - That's what they're saying. They! Who's "they"? - Boss, I want a room. - At this time of day? Now is as good a time as any. Besides, I'm sleepy. I'll pay in advance. It's too early. The rooms are all occupied. I'll wait. Want something? I'm not thirsty, I'm sleepy. Nelly, is that you? Yes, it's me. I'm glad you're back. I've been so worried. Have you seen the paper? Yes. Let that be a lesson to you. No more running away. Don't worry. They won't bother you. They don't know who killed poor Maurice. Some say it was Lucien Lagardier. Others say it was a soldier. Maybe yours. My poor child! I don't want anyone bothering him. We both know who did it. And I can prove it. You have too much imagination. You heard a scream and found a cufflink behind a crate and now you're imagining terrible things. Be quiet. I'm telling you, I know. I bet the police came here today. Did you mention Jean? The police did come here today. They were very polite. But I did not mention Jean. If they had searched for him, they would have found him with you. I'm sure you spent the night with him. In a hotel. In a bed! You can't scare me now, whatever happens. I'll never be scared again! I want you to let him leave. How you've changed, Nelly! Your eyes have never shone so brightly. You've lost your baby face. Is it because you love him? So that's it. Why do you all have to be in love? Does anyone love me? This is my home. - And my home is your home. - Thanks. Looking at my watercolours? The follies of my youth. Don't judge them too harshly. Give me your passport and I'll take care of everything. - Here. - Thanks. See you later. You don't scare me any longer. You horrify me! Let me go. You disgust me! Don't yell. No one can hear you. I want you to listen. I won't come near you. I'll stay here. I want you to know why I killed him. I thought you liked his looks. That's enough! Maurice was a good-for-nothing. I couldn't bear the idea of you and him... That's enough! I did it because I was jealous. You've never experienced jealousy, you stupid child. It's terrible to be in love, to love like Romeo when you resemble Bluebeard. Be quiet! I horrify you, do I? At times I horrify myself. But it doesn't stop me from living. At times I'm even happy, when you're near me. Leave me alone! I like you even when you scream. You're the only thing I love. Everyone else can die. Jean! Let go of her. - Let go of her, you bastard! - You won't get out of here alive. - Come on. - Watch out! Do you think you can leave, just like that? You must believe in miracles. Or Santa Claus. I'll kill you too! You're the worst scum I've ever met! I'll say she helped kill him. You're disgusting! You don't deserve to live. You're rotten to the core. Rotten! What a mess! Come on. Let's go. Why did you come back? I was on board the ship and then I got off because... I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you I'd been happy in my life for once, thanks to you. Oh, Jean! The ship hasn't sailed yet. You could still make it. The ship? Please, Jean, you must go. Come on. Kiss me. Quickly. There is no time to lose. Quickly! It's not possible. You can't leave me alone. You can't die. I love you so much.
