[quiet music] [doctor] Take a deep breath. [deep breathing] All right. Tell me about these headaches. [raspy voice] Sometimes I can't even think. [doctor] Scale of 1 to 10. [patient] 10. [doctor] And did these happen before the incident? [patient] I don't know. Maybe, uh, happened for a couple years. [doctor] How 'bout the weight gain? [patient] I haven't felt able to do much. Eyes open, Dad. [doctor] You know, it's been a year, and... people grieve differently in different ways. -No. No, no, no. -So, if... That's not what this pain is. That pain... That pain doesn't go away ever, you know. Because that pain isn't physical. This is... [sighs heavily] This is something else. Okay. Okay. I believe you. I believe you. Let's run a couple of tests, all right? Make sure you're okay physically. [machine whirring and clanging] [multiple loud buzzers] [suspenseful music] [buzzers continue] [patient gasping] Get me out. Get me outta here! [machine whirring] [inaudible] [quiet music] [doctor] Unfortunately, we found three lesions on your brain. Now, as this progresses, you may start to experience some facial paralysis, some muscle spasms and tremors, slurred speech. You may experience some dizziness, some numbness. There is no cure, but I think, with a lot of work, we can manage this. [sighs] [announcer] A 9-year-old metro girl has a new lease on life thanks to surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children. Tracy Hoover was given the liver of a 9-year-old accident victim. -Oh, come on. Just a little more. -[announcer continues] Hoover is in critical but stable condition, normal after such an operation. I can't eat that shit. I don't know what's going on. Nate. It's Bobby, Ma. Bobby. Bobby? Yeah. [exhales] I went to the bathroom. Where is your father? Is he at the gym? I... I need him to change me. I'll do it, Ma. No, no, no. I need your father. Where is your father? I got it, Ma. [quiet music] [ripping sounds] [ominous music] [phone ringing] [ringing continues] [phone chimes] Bobby? [chuckling] What's goin' on, dude? Hey. Uh, it's good to hear your voice. How--how have you been? [sighs heavily] Uh, you know, promised Ma I'd call. Oh, uh, Mom was... making sense? She was in and out of lucidity. How's she doing right now? She's not good, Charlie. Uh, [sighs] how are you doin' otherwise? -[quiet music] -[Bobby exhales] Bobby? I'm thinking about coming to visit. Uh, my family and I? Yeah. I mean... I haven't seen the boys in a while and the... I could help with the new baby. We're in our, uh, first trimester. [laughter and squealing] So all is under control here. Give it to me! Give it to me! Look, I don't think I can take it anymore, this house. I don't think I can be here. [muffled clunk] You need to put Mom in a nursing home. I've been telling you for a year now. And she's got money in the bank, right? And I said I'd cover the rest. I mean, having her in that other room, that's too much for you. Okay? Just get over the guilty feelings, dude. I mean, if-- if I were going senile, uh, the last thing I would want is to stress my boys. Bobby? Hey, uh, I mean it. You know, you're welcome here anytime. As long as you need. Yeah. Maybe. When the time comes. [inaudible] Huh. Can you imagine being a horse seamstress? That's pretty cool. -[laughs] -[phone ringing] [radio playing] Bobby, the phone's ringing. Bobby? -[phone ringing] -The phone's ringing. Hello? Phone. Bobby! Hey! Phone. Okay? Got it? Escondido Catering, Moretti. [coughing] -[thud] -[Helene cries out] [Bobby] Oh, shit. Oh, shit. -I just wanted some food. -Okay. It's okay, Ma. I got you. -I got you. -I hit my head. I got you. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Oh, God. All right. We're going to go to the hospital, okay? -Yeah. -All right. [Bobby] Okay. Okay. [somber music] [horn honking] [distant siren] [quiet beeping] Nurse! Bobby. -[shushes] -Ma. -[Helene shushes] -Hi. It was you. What? What, Ma? You left him alone with her. I knew she was a killer! Stop it, Ma. -It was you! -Stop it. It was you! How could you do that to him? I didn't, Ma. [Helene gasping and crying] It was your fault. [cries out] [gasps] [continuous beep] [cries out] [continuous tone] [sobbing] [music playing] -Hey, there they are. -[server] Okay, here we go. -[Debra] Awesome. -[Charlie] Hey. [Debra] Thank you. Do you mind getting us some napkins? -Yep, sure. I'll-- I'll do that. -Thank you so much. [Charlie] Thank you. Now I'm gonna take this while you eat, 'kay? -Okay. -Thank you. You know, I never understood eating after a burial. I don't want to fucking eat after a burial. -[whispering] Watch your mouth. -Sorry. That's all right. [chuckles] Probably go home and inhale the fridge, but... right now, I can't even look at food. It's, uh... comfort food, I guess. Well, I don't feel particularly comforted. Mom, what's "comfort food"? Well, it's food that we love to eat that we know isn't good for us. -Food is good? -[Charlie] Yes. Yes, it is. [laughs] Uh, just some foods aren't. -Eat it. -Otherwise, I'm gonna take every last one of your French fries. [Debra] Honestly, I never got the food thing either. 'Cause when my dad died, you know, I gained 10 pounds. [laughs] I didn't want to say anything. Lightweight. [laughs] -[server] Hey, there we go. -All right. Thank you. Just want to thank you guys for inviting me to stay with you. Well, if need be. Of course. You can always stay with us. I just have... one loose end to fix. Nobody's rushing you, Bobby. [exhales] [phone ringing] -[phone ringing] -Moretti, the phone. -Yeah, it's the phone. -[phone ringing] Escondido Caterers, this is Moretti. Yeah. Let me just pull up your file here. [radio playing quietly] You know what? I am gonna have to transfer you to Jean. I don't work here anymore. -Wh-- what are you doing? -Uh, Mr. Ruiz -is on Line 2 for you. -No. No, no, no, no, wait, no, no. 'Cause I don't do phones. -That's your job. -Gotta get out of here. What do you mean? Get out of here for... for what-- like an hour? What? No. Like, forever. Oh, really? Oh, whoa, whoa! You're quitting on me? I swore to your mother that I would take care of you. What, do you think you could get something better than this? Look at you! You're a nothing! I'm sorry your mother died, okay? Everybody's mother dies sometimes. I lost my mother too! But you know what? Life goes on! Oh, great, okay. All right. Yeah. Well, good luck with life! Fuck. [quiet music] [birds calling] So I inject one in a different part of my body every other day. And this is a steroid, which I take for nerve inflammation. This is actually Keppra, which is an anti-seizure medication, and I take that three times a day. This is everything else I was on before the MS. People live with this, so... [chuckles weakly] We'll find you a great doctor. Yeah. It's not a death sentence. -We're here. -Hey! Noah punched me. [Debra] Noah, where did you get this? Give this to me. [laughs] Oh, Mom kept Dad's stuff? Yeah. Why'd you bring 'em here with you? [distant windchimes] [upbeat music] [door beeps] -There you go. -Thanks, man. Take care. -Bobby Moretti, is that you? -[door beeps] -Trent? -Oh, my fucking God. It's been too long, man. College. 15 fucking years. You look different. Yeah. Uh, so do you. I'm sorry about everything that happened then. I meant to call you, but I didn't have your new number. Same cell I've always had, Trent. -Fuck. I'm so sorry. -It' fine. -You know, nobody ever thought Katharine could, uh-- Yeah. Um... So what's the, uh, strongest eighth you've got? Top shelf. I got you, bro. Indica. 33.3% THC. This will rock your world. All these years, and you're still dealing. All these years, and you're still buying. [chuckles] At least it's legal for us now. True. [ominous music] [sniffs] [sighs heavily] -[knocking] -[Debra] Knock, knock! [drawer closes] Hey. Um, I'm gonna take the boys to the zoo. -Do you want to come? -No. I think I'm gonna head into the city today and look for a job and keep my head on straight. They got octopuses at the zoo! -[boy] No, they don't. -All right. Well, you call us if you want to come, okay? -Okay. -All right. Say bye! -[boys] Bye! -Bye. [Debra and boys laughing] [boy] We gotta get out of here! [distant dog barking] [door creaking] [boy] No, they didn't. The octopuses... What are you doing, Uncle Bobby? Hey. [coughs] Kiddo. [snorts] I thought you were going to the zoo. Hey, we didn't want to go to the zoo with... --out you. Oliver, can you go play with your brother, please? But I need to go pee-pee. Well, you can hold it for one second. [chuckling] I'll be right there, all right? Wow. I see we're keeping our head on really straight. [scoffs] [quiet music] Can I help you? Hi. Uh, are you the manager? Depends who's asking. -I'm just looking for a job. -You sure? I see a fat boy in a suit too small. What do you want to do? Lose weight? Oh. You want to be like them, don't you? Oh, no, no, no, no. They--they'd kill me. Besides, I gotta be careful nowadays. There's nothing careful about boxing. Nor are we hiring. Why don't you try Starbucks down the block? Don't you fuckin' touch me, Tony. So now I can't touch you either? Again? Lacey's being Lacey. [dramatic music] -[manager] Mind your business. -Sorry. Why haven't you left? Listen. This place is great and everything, but I don't see anybody on their hands and knees wiping up the blood and sweat from your mats. What's your name, kid? Bobby Moretti. Moretti. Italian boy? -You from New York? -No. I mean--well, I was born here, and then my family moved to New York when I was really young. Then I came back for college--San Diego. So why you want to scrub my floors, college boy? It's a job. [sighs] Something different. I can think of many different things you need, Big Bobby. -Bobby's fine. -It's my gym. Call people whatever the hell I want to. Yo, Clarence! What's up? Look, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do for your poor toilets. These big beefy-ass dudes taking protein shits in there? What am I paying you for, then, huh? When I got the best plumber in the city right here. -This guy? -Yes, this guy. He look like he the one took the shits. Look, bottom line, you're gonna have to invest in some new toilets. Can you fix the toilets or not? I mean, I can come back tomorrow. Don't bother. All right. Let him fix the toilets then. This place is falling apart anyway. You better know I'll be here for the next fight, though. -You know how to fix toilets? -Yeah. You lying to me? Yes. Walk with me. [upbeat music] Hey, Marco! Higher with your right! Ooh! Good block, Israel. -You box before? -Who, me? Yeah, you. Keep up. No. But my--uh, my dad did professionally. [manager] Ah, then it's ingrained in your blood. No, I can't box. [chuckles] Why? Because you're fat? This is bullshit. Your brain is stronger than your gut. No. I'm--I'm sick. I have MS. That's not an excuse. You set your mind on something, your body will follow. Israel-- black shirt-- had stage IV cancer as a kid. And Chloe-- pink top-- had heart surgery last year. -Would you train me? -Say what? [chuckles] Um, uh, is that even possible? I mean, in exchange, I will learn how to fix your toilet. Back up. This isn't glamorous. Boxing is about finding that inner strength when you have none. Have you got that in you? I think I have to try it. If you want it to work, you have to do more than just try it, Bobby. -I think I can. -Stop it! Stop thinking. What the hell are you? Little Engine That Could? I've got nothing left to lose. And everybody here looks so... peaceful. It's because they settle their problems in that ring. They focus their negativity on that empty space between the bag and the glove. Angry, sweaty, and at peace. It's perfect. -Think so? -Yeah. Then tell me the real reason why you're here. -What, in the gym? -No. In L.A. Hm? Oh, my ma just died and I'm staying with my, uh-- my brother and his family for a while. Nah. That's not it. You gotta be, like, what, 39, 40? 38. No ring? Never married? -Not married anymore. -Divorced? -Gone. -Gone? Well, that's real helpful. If I'm gonna take you seriously, then I've gotta know -the real reason why you're here. -I told you. I was... walking by and I needed a job. -What are you running from? -I just need a job. Why are you being so aggressive? If I'm gonna take you seriously, I've gotta know what got you here. -Now, tell me, Bobby. -[dramatic music] Tell me! Tell me, Bobby! Tell me! [music stops] I... My wife murdered my son. And then she shot herself in the face. Well, there you go. That's what you're running from. -I think... -Look at me. Don't think. Nate Moretti. He died from a brain hemorrhage right there in that very ring. You ever hear of him? He was my father. [quiet music] Moretti. [snaps fingers] That's it. Come here. I'm coming here forever, and... That's your father. He was a good fighter-- a grinder. -You look like him. -No, I don't. Were you there the night he died? No. Thank God. That would have been... Anyways, I took over this gym 10 years ago, and I always felt compelled to keep his picture up. Now I know why. [Bobby] This is why we moved to New York. My mother had to run away. I understand. Welcome home, Big Bobby. [man] What's up, Jo? Hey! Carmine! Uh, this is, uh, Big Bobby. Big Bobby, that's Carmine. Hey, I ran into Clarence down there. -Is the bathroom fixed? -[Jo] What do you think? -The guy's fucking useless. -[Jo laughs] Exactly. He's my assistant. Oh, so you already have someone helping you out? Carmine? Please. [laughs] He doesn't clean. And he barely assists. He just kind of, you know, hangs out. -Good gig. -Well, once I've known you for over 30 years, you can have that gig too. All right, kid. I'm gonna take a chance on you. Roll up your sleeves. It's about to get real messy. Thank you. You're welcome. Wait, can I call you "Jo"? Sure. Everyone else does. Is it short for something? Yep. [dramatic music] -Yo. -Hey. You the new janitor? Um, I guess. Why are you dressed like that? I don't know. [chuckles] Not very talkative, are you? Look. You ain't gotta talk, but... you mind lacing me up? [clears throat] Yeah. Nice and tight on this one. It's healing from a little something. I'm Lacey. -Bobby. -You box? -No. [chuckles] -You will. Thanks. I'll see ya 'round. 'Kay. 'Kay? 'Night, Jo! Night, Carmine. See you mañana. Hey, Bobby. Gym's closed. Thought you went home for the night. Oh, I just got these last couple bags to do. Oh, thank you. Never had a janitor before. I can get used to this. Yeah? I'd be happy to come back tomorrow. Who says I'm done with you now? Oh, sure. What do you need? Wrap your hands. [claps hands] Moving too slow already. Come on. Come on. You gotta get in there. Gotta get in there. -Uh-huh. -Around the thumb. Don't I need gloves? Hey, slow down, champ. [laughs] Gotta work on your stance first. Patience. Okay. -[quiet music] -Okay. Okay. Obviously, you're right-handed, so we're gonna -work on your left jab, okay? -Okay. All right. Let's get in that stance. All right. Go left. Come on. There you go. Push it forward. Pull it back. There you go. All right. Let me see it. There you go. Good. All right. Now let's try to work with your left and your right, okay? Get in your stance. Bend the knees. Right? Okay? There you go. All right. There you go. Snap it back. Keep your chin down. Come on. Let's go faster now. There we go. Let's get some speed in there. [grunts] Come on. Let me feel it. You're gonna be knockin' 'em out, Bobby. Yeah. There you go. Keep that chin, yeah. There you go. Good job. -One, two. All right, faster. -[grunts] Come on. Faster. Faster. Faster. Step into it. Get in there. -Chin down. -[Bobby grunting] Let's go faster. Faster. Come on. Hit 'em hard. There you go. Good job. Come on. Harder. There you go. -Again. -[grunts] -Again. Again. -[grunts] [quiet music] Use your legs. Come on. You gotta use your legs. -Come on! You can do it! -[grunting] Come on. You can do it. -Wait. -[Bobby crying] Wait. No, no, no. Oh, no, no, no. Come on. No. Bobby, no. No, no, no. Don't quit on me now, Big Bobby. -Don't quit on me now. Come on. -[gasping] Come on. Come on. Hang in there. Look at me. Look at me. When you watch boxing from the crowd, when you're not in the ring, it looks like two people are knockin' the shit out of each other for no rhyme or reason. But that's not what this sport is all about. It goes deeper than that. It goes to the soul. Yeah. Sure, violence comes with the territory. But violence has little to do with it at all. -But my body. -Forget about your body. You worry about this. Okay? Thank you. For what? For making me feel... alive. You're welcome, Bobcat. You're welcome. Bobcat? Most of my boxers have nicknames. I like Bobcat for you. -Why Bobcat? -I like it. You got a problem with that? -No. -Good. I want you to wear some different clothes tomorrow. -Put on some shorts, okay? -Okay. I'm gonna get the fuck outta here. Get some sleep tonight. 'Cause tomorrow, you ain't gonna be able to feel your body. Good start, Bobcat. [clapping] Good shit! Good job, Bobcat! [clapping] Good job! [power clacks off] [quiet classical music] Where have you been all day? -I-- -You have dinner in the fridge. I'm good. I think I'm just gonna crash. You're gonna crash? It's not even 10:00. You're up that late with the kids and everything? Oh, they're asleep. They're all in asleep. [laughs] Um, I got a job at a gym. Congratulations. The owner said that she would train me. And I feel like I need that more than the money, maybe. That's great. By the way, I never told you. I love your art. You are really talented. -Really? -Yeah. [laughs] Okay, thank you. Yeah. I love to paint. Never too late. Right? As long as you got that fire inside of you, it's never too late. Painting is very therapeutic. -It really is. -Yeah. Kill two birds with one stone. -Want to try? -Yeah. -I'm gonna... -Yeah, go ahead. Go have a great shower. Don't forget about that food in the fridge, okay? -All right. -All right. Good night. Good night. [ominous music] [gunshot] [gasps] [gunshot] [gasps] [quiet music] Why you cryin', Uncle Bobby? Sometimes adults cry, too, kiddo. Oh, hey. Oof. What'd you do that for? That's what Mommy does when I'm sad. [crickets chirping] [wind rustling] [water gurgling] -Oh. Hey, Bobby? -Oh, hey. I'm done. I'm just-- This whole place is falling apart. [toilet flushes] Well, look at me. I'm a plumber. -[chuckles] -Thanks. Do you mind if I wash my hands real quick? I don't care. So, uh, listen, I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean to... be weird or anything by not saying much. I took no offense. Wasn't weirded out at all. [Bobby] Okay. I'll give you your privacy. No, stay. You can help lace me up again. So Jo give you a nickname yet? Yeah. Bobcat. Bobcat. Love it. [chuckles] What's yours? Boots. And, no, don't call me that. -You hittin' the bags today? -No. Just a quick spar with Tony in the ring. Then I gotta get home and relieve the babysitter. Oh. Oh, you have a kid. Yeah. Riley. She's 10. -Mine's 10 too. -Yeah? Boy or girl? [quiet music] Sorry. I should have said "was" 10, um... Boy. It's Danny. Oh, shit. I'm so sorry. Thanks. We ain't gotta talk about it. Okay. So, uh, Tony, is he, uh... -My boyfriend? -Yeah. I don't know. He's something. Is he Riley's dad? [chuckles] Tony couldn't keep a plant alive. Wow. I feel bad for him. [chuckles] Do you always spar with him? It's more civil in the ring than at home. That doesn't seem like a fair fight. 'Cause I'm a girl? -I can kick his ass. -Okay. Fine. Give me your other hand. [ominous music] Keep going. Thanks, Bobcat. See ya 'round. [Tony] That's it! That's it! -[grunts] -That's it. That's it. Come on. Come on. Come on. What you got? -[grunts] -Come on, Boots! Come on, Boots! What you got? That's it. Yeah, come on. Come on, Boots. I've seen your ass move faster than that. -[grunts] -Yeah. Come on. [grunts] [ominous music] Huh? [cries out] Hey! Tony! What the fuck? You know I don't allow that in my gym! It was an accident. Sorry, Lacey. You're not hurt. -Fuck you, Tony! -Accident, my ass. Come on. It was an accident. Lacey. Are you--are you okay? -You okay? -[Tony] It was an accident. -What happened? -I know how to get your ass. No Friday Night Fights for a month. You know my rules. Come on. That's fuckin' bullshit, Jo! -That was really fucked up, Tony. -Who the fuck are you? -[Jo] Don't start with nobody. -Huh? -Oh, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey. -Fuck you, nobody. -[Bobby grunts] -[Jo] You done lost your fucking mind. Out. -Out! Out! -He hit me first! Now! Fuck is wrong with you? [sighs] Ooh. So what are these Friday Night Fights? A little match we have every first Friday of the month. Draws a crowd. Brings in a little extra cash. That asshole Tony always wins. Why do you let him fight here? [Carmine] Money. People like to bet on him. He's a big draw. How's the eye? [grunts] I'll live. [Jo] Great. Let's get you up. Starting training. You can still see out of the other eye, can't you? Come on. Stop crying. Let's go. Let's move. [laughs] [upbeat music] Work the right. Right jab. Good jab. Good right jab. Good right jab. Good. [Carmine] You like this? What, what, what? Ooh, gotta watch out for that, Bobcat. -[Jo laughs] -[Carmine] Don't apologize. Pay attention, all right? Now block, now block, block. I'm comin' at you from my left. Block it! Block it! Good! Good, Bobby. Good. Come on. -Good. Good. -[Jo] Good, good. Don't break eye contact, Bobcat. -[Bobby grunts] -[Carmine] Hit! Hit! -Hit! -[Bobby] Sorry. So-- [laughs] -Fucking guy apologizes. -[Jo laughs] -He's pretty good, Jo. -You know, you're an old man, Carmine. Put him in the ring with somebody like Tony, we might have to get ourself a new janitor. With Tony banned, who's fightin' Friday night? Well, we got Marco vs. Israel. They're pretty good. [breathing heavily] Pretty good? They're fucking great. Hey, can I come watch? -Friday Night Fights? -Yeah. It can get a little messy. Good thing the janitor will be there. Yeah, I know that's right. Boom. All right. Let's work on that left. Work on your left jab. -Let's go. Come on. -[Carmine] Jab! Jab! -[Bobby] Hey. -[Charlie] Yo! -What you doing? -Picking up after the boys. Come on. Let's, uh, sit down, catch up. -Mm, thanks, man. -Hey, no problem. Is work kicking your ass? What? Your face. Oh. Um... [chuckles] -I fell. -[laughs] You sound like Dad. What are you talking about? He used to come home all the time with another injury or excuse for Mom. How do you even remember that? I used to sneak downstairs after bedtime [chuckles], uh, to see him and hid behind the kitchen door. They would stay up for hours talking about his fights. And, well, some things you never forget. And for everything else, there's Mastercard. Cheers. Ah, you're not funny. Douchebag. Hey, man. I'm glad we're doing this. Doing what? Sitting in the backyard drinking beer? Yeah. I rarely see ya. I mean, you-- you leave early in the morning, and, by the time you come back, I'm-- I'm already passed out. Gotta keep busy. I'm fine. I could talk to Steve. What, Steve Connors, your boss? Yeah. See if he's hiring. Make some actual money. Listen. I worked at a job I hated for 14 years. I'm not about to do it again. What is it that you do at the gym every day? I clean. I train. Every now and again, you get punched in the face? Sometimes. So what? I know you've had it rough, Bobby. But, uh, you know, I--I want you to... Uh, no. I, uh--I, uh-- I need you to be happy. Why? Why do you need that for me? Since when do you care about me? Listen. I am happy. I don't need to get on my knees for Steve Connors in order to be. Well [clears throat], cheers, then. To what? Being happy. -[music playing] -[indistinct chatter] [whispering] Uh-oh. Here he come. Yeah, you know, if you was my girl, I wouldn't -take your money all the time. -Good to see you, man. -Good to see you too. -You trying to break the bank tonight? -Hey. Need a new chain. -Oh, as always. Coolio, stop taking all her money, man. She needs to buy some toilets in this joint. Bro, that's what I do. Y'all need some air conditioners. -I know that's right. What's up, Jo? -What you doing here? -I told you I was coming to the fights. -Man. -Toilets ain't fixed. Nothing. -The big boy fix 'em? -Get your ass on outta here. -Ah, I'm gonna go take a shit right now. See ya. [woman] What's up, baby? [Jo] Hey, girl. You good? Bobby! Saved a seat for you. Thanks. Hey, Lacey. Bobcat. Nice bruise. Pretty stupid of you to say what you said to him. Well, I was standing up for you. 'Cause I can't take care of myself? Hey, hey. Could you all chill? So we can enjoy the fight? Geez. Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to Friday Night Fight! In the right corner, weighing in at 207 pounds, Marco "The Deckmaker" Deckmann! And in the left corner, weighing in at 212 pounds, Israel "The Liquidator" Duffus! All right. Touch gloves. -Here we go. -[bell rings] [dramatic music] [man] He's dropping his chest! Hey, he's dropping his chest. [grunting] Off the ropes, Israel! Off the goddamn ropes, man! -[spectator] Whoa! -Now's the time! The combo! [Jo] That's it, that's it, that's it! Go. Chin down. Chin down. [man] Get off the ropes, man! Get off the ropes! -Yes! -[Carmine] Break, break. -Break it up. -Back him up. Back him up. -Break. Break. Break. Hold up. Come on. -Hold him. Hold him. See the way he's using his legs? [whispering] Yeah. Power in his legs. Hey. Here's the good news. [crowd cheering] [ominous music] [man] He's dropping you, but you're dropping your left hand, Jack. You're dropping your left-- he's-- he's dropping your fucking left hand. -You didn't say nothing. -Focus. Focus. Dig-- focus. Dig down. You understand me? This motherfucker can't beat you. He can't beat you. Get up and go out and get that motherfucker. [bell rings] [man] Work the hands, man. Israel, work those hands. [quiet music] [music continues] [music continues] Come on. Come on. You got lucky. [man] Someone's salty! -'Night, guys. -'Night, Boots. Addicting. No matter how many times you get hurt. Can I walk you home? Tony's around here somewhere, I think. Are you-- are you waiting for him? No. So, uh... how are you gonna get home? [laughs] I'm walkin'. I live two blocks away. Keep up. [traffic noise] I'm right around the corner. Thanks. Um, I could take you to your door. You're not taking me anywhere. Okay. Good night, then. [inhales] Look. Tony has a bad temper. But you don't know me. What if I'm worse? Doubt it. Do you love him? He makes money, and he helps me out sometimes. Let's leave it at that, okay? See you around, Bobcat. -Later, Boots. -Shut up. [quiet music] [bag thumping] Jesus Christ. Stop. Let's go do something else. [music playing] [Carmine] Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Don't stop. Go! Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Good. [grunts] [grunts loudly] [continues grunting] [loud sustained grunt] [quietly] That's it. Work it. [Carmine] Don't stop. Push, push, push. -Don't stop. Keep it going. -[breathing heavily] Five... four... three... two... one. Hit it. Champion of the world, Bobcat Moretti! [Carmine laughs] [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] So when you gonna get fit again? The day I'm no longer old. [Jo] Get outta here. [Lacey] Has anybody seen Bobcat? All I see is some skinny white boy. Hey, that joke is already old. [both laugh] [Jo] Mm-hmm. -Short again? -Soon. I promise. Next week. No skimming this month. [Lacey] Okay. You got it. -Hey! -[Jo] Hey. I thought I said wait in the office. They ran out of Gatorade. Oh, Riley, say hi to my friend. Hi. I'm Riley. Got a name? Bobby. It's nice to meet you, Riley. -Woo. Ooh, ow! -[laughter] -Whoa! -[laughter] She'll kick your butt one day. Hey, we're going for tacos. You done? Sure. Just let me get cleaned up. We'll wait outside. See ya. -Thank you. -Uh-huh. [upbeat music] You gotta eat to lose weight. As crazy as it sounds, it's true. I'm not hungry. Come on. One bite won't kill you. -Oh, yeah. That's good. -See? See? -That's very good. -Authentic-a! Mmm! [laughs] [ominous music] [music stops] [rock music] [music continues in distance] I'm so sorry. -Forget a little something? -Yes, my brain. I'm-- I'm-- I'm really sorry. -That's a nice excuse. -Hey, buddy. Ooh. Happy birthday. I'm so, so sorry. Well, did you at least got me a present? [Bobby] I have a feeling that Uncle Bobby's gonna bring you something real special tomorrow. Oh, sure you do. What's that supposed to mean? -It's okay. Stop. -No, it's not. [Debra] No, I know, but not here. I'll be right back. Hey, Debra, is everything okay? Yeah. It's all right. [pins clatter] [distant music] Look. Look. It-- it's my MS, all right? I-- I know it's not an excuse, but-- [scoffs] You're at the gym all day, not getting paid. You could stay here all day and not get paid too. You've been here for months, and we haven't seen you. You don't do anything to help out around the house. -It's true. And you do live rent-free. -That's-- I got this, Deb. Fine. I'll get another job! Oh, another job. That's funny because, uh... -jobs pay, and yours doesn't. -We're just concerned. Would you ever consider working again? Just do something with your life, Bob. You think that you got all your shit together because you're married and you have kids? I never said that. You know, because I had all of that. And look where it fucking got me. Nowhere. We've wanted you out of the house for months. All right? You're a fucking loser. [Debra gasps] Charlie. What did you just call me? You heard me. You're a fucking loser. Now get the fuck outta my house. [ominous music] [Bobby] Fuck. Charlie. -Get the fuck outta-- -What are you doing? I'm done, man! Fuck. Fuck! Shit! Damn it! Oh, my God, you guys. Stop it! Stop it! [Charlie] Get off me! -There's people outside. -[grunting] Charlie! Come here! -Ow! -[Bobby] Oh! Shit! -Shit! What the fuck, asshole! -Oh, my God. -Deb. Deb, Deb, Deb, Deb. Deb, are you okay? -I'm sorry! I'm sorry! -[Charlie] I'll take you to the hospital, okay? -I'll stay here -and watch the boys. -What? You're not getting anywhere near them, all right? They're coming with us. Boys, put your shoes on, 'kay? Do not be here when I get back. Charlie! [crickets chirping] [Riley] Come in! Hey, Bobby. Hey, Riley. Mom? Bobcat's here, and he got punched in the head. [Lacey laughs] Go brush your teeth and get ready for bed. Hey. Your couch is over here. Let me see if I can get some Neosporin for that gash. [Bobby] Nice place. I can't thank you enough. Is this your mother? Hm? No. That's my ajee. -Who? -My grandmother. Oh. She's really pretty. She raised me. My mom died when I was in diapers. And my dad kinda sucked, so... It was just me and my ajee. Some people say she looked like me, but I think that she looked like Nina Simone. I could see it. Nina Simone? No. You. Thanks. [clears throat] Sit. [Bobby] Where'd you learn how to do this? -I was a surgeon back in Trinidad. -Really? No. I'm just fucking with you. It's Neosporin and a Band-Aid. But you're from Trinidad? Mm-hmm. -I bet it's beautiful. -It is what it is. There. All done. Thank you, doctor. [Riley] Mommy, I'm in bed! Did you brush your teeth? -Yes. -Girl, go brush your teeth! [Riley groans] Was yours a precious little liar too? He would have been her accomplice. Shit. Sorry. I promised myself I wouldn't bring that up. [quiet music] It's okay. Hey. We all broken. The difference is how you choose to put yourself back together again. And what you're doin' for yourself... you are the toughest guy I know. -[kiss] -Hey. What are you doing? Oh, shit. I'm so sorry. What were you thinking? [groans] I guess I wasn't. [Riley] Mom, I'm done! I--I--I'm coming, sweetheart. I'm gonna tuck you in. [gasping] I gotta go. [Lacey] No. You have no place to go. What-- you're shaking, Bobby. -Oh! Are you okay? -[groans] What's going on? What's wrong? -Hey, is it epilepsy? -[groans] No! -Is it-- -[breathing heavily] Come on, Bobby. [Bobby grunts] No. -Bobby. -[grunting] Yep. I'm fine. What are you doing? I'm fine. [grunting] [loud knocking] -Why was your top lock on? -I don't know, Tony. I saw that fat fuck outside. I thought you had higher standards. Fuck you, Tony. Riley is in there sleeping. Oh, is she asleep? Don't touch me! -I like the skirt. -I said, stop playin'. -Come here. -I'm not playin' right now. -Keep doin' it, and I'll... -You'll what? ...make your face ugly. Do it. [Tony grunts] [muffled grunting] [ominous music] [whispering] Beautiful princess. I love you. [Riley] Me too. [Charlie] Don't call me. We're at the hospital. We're gonna be here for a while. Don't hang up. Please. I just want to know about Deb. Is she all right? [Deb] I'm fine, Bobby. And the baby? The baby's fine too. Thank God. Listen. Listen. I'm-- I'm really-- [Charlie] No. You listen, all right? Don't call us. I want to meet my new nephew. [Debra] Bobby, you will. Just, please, give us some space right now. [crickets chirping] [footsteps] [key jingling] What are you doing here, Bobcat? Good morning. Have you been sleeping here all night? Nah, I've been awake. Go on, let's go inside. So, what's up, Bobcat? What am I doing here, Jo? I was about to ask you the same thing. No. I--I mean what am I doing here at the gym, in general? -Apparently not sleeping. -I'm being serious, Jo. [laughs] Okay, you are... -training? -Yeah. But I'm also cleaning. I--I need a job. Look. Look. I got this-- this great thing going here, and I really love it, but I need to move forward in my life. I need money to do that. Fine. I'll start paying you. -You will. -But training is now on your own time. -Thank you. -But I want you here this early every morning to get the gym open. -No problem. -Is that it? Is that what you waited all night to tell me? No. I want to know more about you. -Me? -Yeah. I mean, you know all my baggage. I want to know who I'm working with. -[quiet music] -Well, you're working with someone who took a fat kid with no life and... turned him into the man who's standing in front of me. That's who you're working with. Anything else? No. Forget it. No, no, no, no, no. Spit it out. You walked in here with more confidence. Be confident. Are you Lacey's landlord? Oh. Yeah. She's staying at a... former rental that I had with, um... I ju-- I just help her out. I give her a break on rent. -Oh, that's nice. -Yeah. You want me here on time, right? -Yes. -Let me sleep here. Do you see any beds or mattresses here? There's the physical therapy table in the back nobody uses. It looks pretty comfortable. Where-- where we going with this? Look... -My brother-- -Kicked your ass out? -[quietly] Yeah. -How long? Just for a little while. I better not see a spike in my water bill. Get to work. Thank you. Mm-hmm. [chuckles] -Hey. -Hey. You scared me the other night. You're not gonna tell me what's up? -Did he come with you? -Answer the question. Okay, forget it. Not my problem. [clapping] Let's go, let's go, let's go! Lookin' good! Lookin' good! Yo, T! Just who I need to see. I have no one to fight this month. -I need you. -Oh, now you need me. For a change, yes, I need you, Tony. What about janitor boy? Don't be an asshole. I'm in if he's in. What about Razor? [Jo] Yeah. Razor's been looking good. [Tony] That's my deal. That dude or nobody. Then I'll find someone else. No. I'll do it. Very funny. Hell no. I got this, Jo. -I said no. -Why? I want this. I said I'm in. What you trying to prove, Bobby? I don't know. I guess I'll find out. [Tony] Looking forward to it. Promise I won't kill him. You'll never fuck my girl, but I'm looking forward to fucking you up. You know you just really fucked up, right? You're gonna have to double down on training. He's been fightin' in the ring for years. Even if I lose, if I get to hit that motherfucker even one time, I'll consider it a minor victory. Then I won't stop you, Bobcat. [Jo] It's not an excuse. You set your mind on something, and your body... Boxing is about finding that inner strength when you have none. If you want it... Have you got that in you? You have to do more than just-- than try... ...focus their negativity on that empty space between the bag and the glove. [Lacey] You are the toughest guy I know. [Jo] Angry, sweaty... All right. Faster. Come on. Faster. Faster. Faster. Step into it. Get in there. [Charlie] Just do... something with your life. -[Debra] Would you ever consider working? -[Charlie] We've wanted you out of the house for months. All right? -You're a fucking loser. -[Bobby] What are you doing? [Charlie] I'm done, man. [Helene] It was you! It was you! You killed him! [Carmine] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Friday Night Fight! [crowd cheering] [punches and thuds] -[man] Come on. There we go. -[Jo] Good job. Come on. Harder. There you go. -[Carmine] Again! Again! -[Bobby grunting] Again! Open your eyes. [sirens blaring] -[inhales sharply] -[silence] [gate creaks open] [slams shut] [footsteps] Hello? [creaking footsteps] Hello? Bobcat, what the hell are you doing here? Oh, uh, Jo's, um, letting me-- Oh, your old lady kick you out too? [laughs] Something like that. Fuck! Where am I gonna sleep now? I guess the ring is soft enough. I've done it before. I'm wasted. I'm gonna pass out anyway. Fuck it. Long as I'm still breathing... -I'm good. -Okay. Good night. By the way... I trained... Nate. Your dad, you know. -[quiet music] -It was a long time ago. Why didn't you tell me? Well, you haven't seen me stumbling in here shitfaced before. And you-- you don't talk about him either. Um, I mean, I was so young when he died. He was so... fuckin' good, Bobby. Yeah. I heard. I wish you would have seen him fight. Were you two close? Close? He was a groomsman at my wedding. Hey. If he was so good, then-- then why-- why did he-- Don't say that. Accidents happen in the ring. That was a bad fuckin' accident. You're gettin' in the ring with a killer. You gotta know that. You dad, he would have rearranged Tony's face, but you-- you ain't your dad, kid. Although, I do-- I see a lot of him in you. So you pay attention. You got it? You be careful. Okay. You know what his nickname was? Bobcat. Because he jumped at you! [laughs] Like a bobcat. That's why he named you Bobby. [music playing] [whispering] Oh, man. You got this. Bobcat. And, if not, you gotta know what it feels like to get your ass kicked in order to truly enjoy kicking someone else's. [laughs] [footsteps] What are you doing here? What, there's no fresh air at the gym? [inhales] I wanted to apologize. Thanks. Me too. So where have you been staying? Um, at the gym, actually. They started paying me, and it just makes sense. I'm there all the time anyway. The rent is free. I'm training for my first fight. Are you out of your mind? No, Charlie. I finally found it. Goddamn it! Dad used to say that to Mom verbatim. You are so damn lucky you weren't old enough -to be at that fight. -I wish I was. Why would you say that? Do you know why my name is Bobby? Yeah. -Why didn't you tell me? -'Cause those are fuckin' bad memories for me, man. Dad was a legend. -Yeah, he's-- he was killed. -[quiet music] You could die doing anything. You know? What happened to Dad was rare. Yeah. He died. But he really lived. And, because of that, many great people kept him alive. [groans] Can I come watch you fight? No. No, no. Please don't. You'd be worried. I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked anyway. Can you at least tell me which gym you're living at? And how'd you find out about your name? You're fighting at the same gym where Dad... [exhales] Better see you at Christmas. [crickets chirping] [Jo whispering] Oh, damn. I hate these bolts. -Boots! It's me! -Sorry. -[Jo] Hey. -Hey. -[Lacey] I got it. -Mm-hmm. [both laugh] Well, hey there, baby girl. What you doing? You doing your homework? -Yeah. -Give me a hug. [Jo laughs] Riley, go get ready for bed. Take a shower. Okay. Be a good girl. -[Jo] Thank you. -So... What you been doing with Bobby? What do you mean? I don't even recognize him anymore. He needs this, Boots. What does he need? -He didn't tell you? -Tell me what? Bobby has MS. No. No, he didn't tell me that. You're going to fucking get him killed, Jo. Did I turn you away when I met you nine years ago? -Fighting works for postpartum. -Oh, here you go. I guess you don't remember what I had to do the last time I came through that door, huh? I punish myself for that every day. And would you be alive to punish yourself if it wasn't for me? No. -Get out, Jo. -No. I don't fuckin' need this shit right now. What did you say when we met? This ain't about me. This is about Bobby! What did you say? -I said I felt dead inside. -So does he. The exact same words. So you worry about you and your daughter. Bobby will be just fine. -Yo, yo! What's up? -Well... Well, look what the cat just dragged in. -Oh, so you're calling me a rat? -Mm-hmm. Your boy's a rat. I'm a wolf. And I'm gonna eat him like he's my prey on fight night. -Whatever. -Is anyone even bettin' anywhere? I could beat this dude with one hand behind my back. Well, how 'bout you have both arms behind your back, asshole? You better keep it clean. I'm out. See you Friday. -Bye, Jo. -Yeah, yeah, whatever. Thought you were training tonight. Nah, just leg work. Do you know he has MS? -I don't give a fuck. -You can't do this. You're gonna fucking kill him. -It is what it is. -I'm leaving. Me and Riley. And you won't see us again. She'll stay with me, and you can get the fuck out! Tony, you can get the fuck out. [Tony grunts] [breathing heavily] Okay. You wanna play games? Huh? We're gonna fuckin' play games tonight. [belt cracks] Let's fuckin' play. [Riley] Mom, who is that? C-- coming, baby! I'm comin'! [breathing heavily] Fuckin' shit. [Carmine] Pay attention, Bobcat. Go to his left! Left! -[Bobby gasps] -[Carmine] Okay. All right. We're good for today. Well, at least he promised that he wouldn't kill ya. Can't back out now. I'm not plannin' on it. Good. 'Cause you'd be surprised how many people bet on you. On me? Why? Apparently, you're, um... inspiring or some shit. -I'm making a huge mistake. -Relax. Think about it. You'll be more prepared and less nervous for your second fight. If he makes it to his second fight. [ominous music] -Jo, Jo. -Hey, what's up, C? Hey, I got, uh, 20 bucks on your toilet boy. -Shut up. -But this is a... used Cadillac convertible for me when he wins. You just make sure that left hook comes what you said at. I never said he was good. No refunds. -Where Coolio at tonight? -[laughs] Saving his money. That's 'cause he know your boy ain't got no hands. -Give me my money back, Jo. -You snooze, you lose. Go have a seat. You're cold, man. [rap music] [muffled music continues] -[knocking] -Knock, knock. Hey. I don't feel good about this, Bobby. I still don't know what you're trying to prove here. Don't worry about it. You have multiple sclerosis. He's gonna fucking kill you, Bobby. My guess is he's scarred you worse than anything he's gonna do to me tonight. Shit. I'm--I'm sorry. Fuck you. I'm not watching. I'm outta here. Bobcat? You ready? [ominous music] [music stops] Let's do this. [stirring music playing] [music continues] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Friday Night Fights. In this corner, undefeated at 13-0, Tony "The Reaper" Pinto! And, in this corner, -in his first Friday Night Fight, -[Jo clapping] -Bobby "Bobcat" Moretti! -[applause] [cheering and shouting] Okay. Protect yourselves at all time. And obey what I say. Let's have a clean fight. Touch gloves. [Jo] It's all right, Bobby. Let's go. Come on. [muffled audience shouting] Ready! Ready! -Box! -[bell rings] [dramatic music] [grunts] [crowd gasps] [muffled cheering and whistling] [Jo] Put your hands up! Keep your hands up! [man] Come on, Bobcat! [music playing] -[Jo] Protect yourself! -[Tony grunts] [gasps] [applause] -Yes! -Yeah! Let's go! Let's go! You got this! [crowd groans] That's all right. Get up! Come on! You got this! Come on. It's okay! [clapping and shouting] [dramatic music] [man] Don't give up! Keep fighting! [applause and cheering] [grunting] [Tony loudly grunting] [ominous music fading out] [dramatic music] [Nate] Open your eyes. -[crowd cheering] -[grunting] [crowd cheering] [Jo] It's all right. It's okay. -[whispering] -[Bobby whimpering] It's gonna be okay, all right? [ominous music] -[crowd shouting] -[bell rings] Break. Break. Break! Break! Break it up. Dude. Break it up. Break. [quiet music] [music continues] [music intensifies] One... two... three... four... [quietly] Stay down, kid. Five... six... seven... eight... [muffled] nine... [crowd booing] [quietly] Your ass is still standing. You did that. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you, Bobcat. -[quiet music] -[muffled crowd cheering] [muffled] Yeah! Bobby! [muffled cheering and applause] [muffled] ...his fucking jaw, Bobcat! -What is that? -So fucking proud of you! I am so goddamn proud of you, Bobcat. Where are you going? I think he should go to the hospital. -[Charlie] You did it, buddy! -Bobcat! -Bobcat, where are you going? -Bobcat, where are you going? Hey, Bobby? [quiet music continues] [crickets chirping] [Lacy] It's not locked, Tony. You should have seen the other guy. What the fuck are you doing here? He won. But I made him bleed. We're done. Okay? Go to the hospital. I love you. What? -Everything about you-- -No. [sighs] No, you don't. Is that why you fought him? My father... was great. But then one night, the other guy was better. [crying] And then I couldn't protect my own son. That's why I fought Tony tonight. You don't even forgive yourself. How you gonna love somebody else? I know love when I feel it. [whispering] Bobby. -You're confused. -No. Look at you. I've loved before. I know. Okay, look. I don't care. You want a competent father for Riley? I was a damn good father. Maybe. But not anymore. So, Tony. Tony. That--that asshole? He's the right guy for you? He's Riley's dad. [exhales] Go to the hospital. [lock clicks] You have a broken nose, two broken ribs, and internal bleeding. You have MS. What compelled you to do it? Strength. Such a load of horseshit. Anyway, you got very lucky. She is right, though. You got lucky. He could have killed you. Yeah, he could have. But he didn't. You know, I broke my... first rib boxing when I was 16. [chuckles] My parents practically disowned me. -[Bobby exhales] -Thought you might want to know something about me, you know? Trying to throw you a bone here, kid. [laughs] You did good. You still got a lot more work to do, though. No. -I'm done training. -[clicks tongue] They all say that. You're not done. Get some rest. See you in about a week. Seriously. I'm finished. Stop saying that. I saw my father last night. -And? -[quiet music] I used to see Danny... and Katharine... all the time... in my dreams. But since I started boxing, I haven't seen them as much. I haven't needed pot or pills. My head has been clear. But it was good to see him again. But I can't do this anymore. I'm too weak. My body hurts too much. I'm in too much pain. I got what I needed, Jo. I'm done. You're never done. You'll be back. You need this. This is your drug. I'll see you when you're thinking straight. Why'd you never quit, Jo? 'Cause... I'm not a victim like you. God. [exhales] God, grant me the serenity to accept the things that... I cannot change. And the courage... to change the things that I can. And the wisdom to know the difference. Drugs or alcohol? Yeah. Got so bad that my partner left me after 10 years. And... you know, we-- we-- we tried adopting, but... didn't work, so... We got a dog, though. [chuckles] She took her. God. I miss that fuckin' dog. -Jo. -Joanne. Joanne Wallis. My name is... Joanne Wallis. And I'm an addict. I'm an addict. [whispering] You'll be back. [dragging sounds] Mom, Uncle Bobby's here. [quiet footsteps] Get off that chair. Go put that back where you got it. Go on. Thank you. Oh, hi. -Can I come in? -Yes, come on in. [music playing] [Bobby] And then the toilet paper fart monster... turned into... a Dracula-- aaahhh! [laughing] It's nice to have him back. -[kids giggling] -You should tell him. -Yeah? -[Bobby] I told you it was a true story. -Why not? -Eh, maybe. [both laugh] -Hey, Bobby. -oh. -Is that for me? Okay. -Yeah. All right. Thank you. -[Charlie] Open it up. -Whoa! Big wheels. [boy] Thank you so much, Dad! [chuckles] -[gasps] -[Bobby] Ooh. [Debra] Ooh! [quietly] Oh, shit. Whoa! Okay. Hey, you're okay. Hey. You're okay, baby. You got this, Deb. We're going to the hospital. [PA] Dr. Forest, dial 118, please. -Hi, Uncle Bobby. -Hi, Uncle Bobby. -Congratulations. -Thank you, good man. -[Charlie grunts] -Meet Alex. Hi, Alex. Hey, buddy. [laughs] -He looks like you. -Gee, thanks. [laughter] Just like that, huh, Bobby? What? New life. [static] [doctor] Are you expecting a difference? There is none. Not much has changed. [Bobby] That's okay. I'm surprised you are here. You are a brave man, sir. I would not put myself through continued misery. Most people are not tough. True. [beeping] [buzzer] [multiple clicks] Mr. Moretti... be well. [ominous music] Hi, Kat. Happy new year. Sorry about the cane. I'm not walkin' too well these days. [Katherine whimpering quietly -So, guess what? [sniffs] -[quiet music] Um... Debra had another baby. [quiet whimpering] A little boy. You have a new nephew. He looks just like... [whimpering] No, you don't have to speak, Kat. It's okay. Um, I'm living with them in Los Angeles. [sniffs] For now, anyway. [sobbing] [crying] Why am I here? [sobbing] I'm sorry. [crying] I... I forgive you. [crying] [sobbing] [quiet music] [taps on wall] [Jo] We're closed! -Bobcat. -Hi, Jo. You never returned any of my calls. So... what do you want? Happy Valentine's Day. Appreciate the nice gesture. [laughs] Nobody should be eatin' this shit. Thanks, Jo. Same time tomorrow? Dawnmarie, I want you to meet Bob Moretti. Bobby, that's Dawnmarie Deshaies. Such a pleasure to meet you. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis over 20 years ago. Secondary progressive. She comes in every day. Just like you used to. You're such an inspiration. You are a warrior, and I am inspired by you. Thank you. Have a great night. Bye, everybody. Absolutely. So, when you left me high and dry, I decided to do my research on multiple sclerosis. And now I have three clients. -You're an inspiration. -Oh. Haven't seen you in months. Where the hell have you been? Look at me. What am I looking for? You've always been so good at that. Good at what? At making me forget what I am. So what are you? Hm? Still a victim? Lacey asks about you. I tell her, I don't know. Haven't seen him. -You should give her a call. -Maybe. So... are you back? I want to be, -but I can't. -Why not? -Jo. -Jo what? Look. Nobody knows the future. Not you. Not the doctors. -So why not? -Jo, come on! No. You come on. You could have a stroke while wiping down a bag or get hit by a fucking bus! Nobody knows! I feel dead already. Oh, come on. Stop it with that melodramatic bullshit, Bobcat. Stop calling me that. I'm not Bobcat. That's not my name. Well, in this gym, you earned that name. I didn't earn it! I'm not my father. I got something for you. This is your father's medal. He won his second Friday Night Fight. He lost his first fight just like you did. If you come back, you're gonna win your second fight too. Still think you don't have anything in common with your father? Oh, stop it now. Come on, oh, now. No cryin' in my gym. Thank you. You're welcome. Now, look here. Give me this cane, and give me this Sunday best, and let's get back to work, okay? -No. -Yes. -We're going back to work. -No, I can't. Yes, you can. Now, come on, Bobcat. -Let's get back to work. -[whimpers] Let's go! You can do it. Let's go. -Hit it! -No. -Hit it! -[crying] Come on, Bobcat. You got it. Come on. [grunts] Hit it! Harder! There you go. Gimme a combo. -There you go. -[grunts] Hit it! Come on, Bobcat! Good job. Excellent. -[cries out] -Okay, okay, okay. I know that hurt, now. I'm sorry. But look. Look at me.
