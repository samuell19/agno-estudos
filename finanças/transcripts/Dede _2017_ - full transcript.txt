"I'll be going to my village." - As well? The road is blocked. On horseback, the boys pick up the supplies when they can. I can take the supplies, but will not you stay at my wedding?

Do not touch me! - You will stay with me. - Never! Do not be a child! Think carefully! You will stay here with me. You will stay with me. I will not stay, ever! You're in my house. We are a family. Now your only concern is our life together, understand? I do not want you! No matter what you want, you're my wife now! This is never going to happen. You're not going to leave my house!

Come on, get me out of here. You have to stay. If you leave, there will be bloodshed in the families. Congratulations! The movie will start in a minute. "La Loc" Happen, great film by director Eldar Shengelaia. I was not as strong as you, Dina. You do not have to stay there. - Why did not you resist? - Watch the movie! They would have killed each other. Try not to think about it. I could not let them kill themselves. You had no choice. They would have killed each other, without lives. I could not stand it. - Let's go! - Quickly! This is time to end the energy. Come back tomorrow night to see the end of the movie. Come on kids! "What are you doing?" "You should use that." This is for children, they do not need it. I had a bad dream. He will protect you. "You should wear one too." - I'll come for you. Gegi! What's that? Your grandfather wanted you to know about his grandfather's death, We came to communicate to you. God has it. My poor grandmother - Sorry, I'll bring more news. - Take care! I'm going to the village to talk to your grandfather. David's family will be there. I do not want you to end up fighting. If you want, I'll go with you. No, stay here and look at her. What if her grandfather does not let you in the house? In such a situation, I can not ignore it. I'll go first, then I'll take Dina. Be careful! Poor Gegi... What happened? How will we live now? Poor Gegi... How did this happen? Water, quick! Dina! God help us! Poor Gegi... You died too soon. Who will take care of your son and your wife? You died young. You will not see your boy grow up. Our poor Gegi... You died too fast. You died young. You will not see your boy grow up. - Bless me, Father. "Bless you, Girshel. "I want to ask for your permission." - I'm listening. I have loved Dina since childhood and want to marry her. Gershel, in fact, these are our traditions, but times have changed. Life was harder in times. We only had a few women. These things were necessary for survival. Sometimes there is no other way. Some traditions are good, others should be forgotten. Please rate it well and change your mind, please. Do not do that. Dina will suffer, the baby needs her. Think carefully! Judge before you act. I've already decided! I'll do anything for her! If I do not do it, another will do it. Dina and I are engaged! We do not need to talk. If I do not defend you, they will not stand up. If we do not accept it, there will be bloodshed. The baby has my blood, I do not want him growing up in another family. Try to stay calm. The child will need someone to take care of him. It is all that is left of my son. It is the will of the Lord. What can we do? You have to be strong! We are in the hands of God. You have a life ahead of you, you will have other children. Let's pray for Gegi's soul. God, receive it in paradise! Amen! What do I tell Mose when he wakes up? - Anything. "It's easy for you." When he grows up, you can look for him if you want. He has not grown yet, he needs the hand now! The woman is guilty of it. Everything happens to this woman. Nothing must change, we follow our tradition! It is very easy to blame women for everything... - Shut up! "Drink, and do not tease me!" God bless my poor nephew! - Amen! God keep your soul. Amen. Where are you going? Where are you going? Search for Mose. I can not let Mose go with you. Where is my love? Mose is all that's left of Gegi. Get me or Mose! You can go, but I will not let you take the Mose. Get me or Mose! You do not have to protect us! Let's go and we will defend ourselves! Bring my love back! You will not find it, I hid it to take no risks. How will I do without my son? USHGULI VILLAGE - GEORGIA TR ? S MONTHS LATER Dina! Dina! Dina! Leave me! Dina... You're freezing. Leave me alone! Did I force you to anything? I do everything for you! You took me by force. You forced me to leave my baby! Use your traditions when and how you want! You made my life unbearable! Did not you understand? I love you! You are my life! I do everything for you! I can not live without you. Where you go? Where are you going, what are you doing? - On a hunt. - At where? Do not go, it's too cold, you can freeze! If something goes wrong, it's your fault. That's when it's time to go hunting, huh? And if something happens, what's on your mind? His soul already bears two burdens, the death of two men. Do you want Girshel to be the third? Why did not you go to sleep, Mother? How can I sleep if you do not come home? Where were you all this time? Hunting. You're lying. You do not need Dina! Believe me, son! There are many other women. Can not you see she's still crying for her husband? She is always dressed in black. You will not have children! You do not need it! Trust me! I do not want to talk about it. I love her. Relax, Mom. Will be all right. A happy New Year! Good luck! Happiness to all! Good luck! Dina. Please celebrate with friends. May Jesus and the soul of our ancestors protect us. We do not have to worship the dead. Cut here! It's all right. Cut right here! That. Christ has mercy on us. Now we are ready for the spirits of the ancestors. "We do everything our Lord likes. - Uncle Onise. Spirits come and stay with us for a week. We just have to respect them. As the ancients taught me. This week people forgive each other. Please forgive Dina. She has to apologize for being married without my permission. I do not forgive you, my family has betrayed me! You do a lot of good things, you're a respected man. Please think about it. She's your granddaughter, after all. Please, I have forgiven her. She is unhappy. Many bad things happened. Only you have that power now. Spirits will be happy to talk to her and forgive her. I can not do this. I will not do that. Ginsher, I told you not to do that. Try to understand her, have patience with her. Tell him I want to see you. She misses the baby and still laments Gegi. I understand, you do it out of love, but you have to be patient. Everything will be fine. You have to accept the facts. Did you tell that asshole not to wear more black clothes? - I told her. - Look! She can not use mourning for the first husband in this house. - I know I know! - Black brings luck! You have to show joy, wear bright colored dresses and make a baby. I do not know who cursed us. She has to change. Where is Dina? There inside. Why did you come? What happened to Mose? Is he okay? He's sick. - Is he alive? - Yes but... Take me to my baby! Take me now! Unfortunately, it has not improved. What you do is you are. It will not help, it's dangerous for children. Get them out of here! You should not do it! He needs medicine! I can heal him, as our ancestors healed. No, we need medicine can come out! - We can not trust the tractor. "You're right, but what can we do?" Tell your sister that ritual does not help. It is contagious to other children. What can we do? Go in the city to seek medicine, but he will die. Yesterday a child died with the same symptoms. "Why do not you go on a tractor?" - It's broken again. Do anything, but bring the pills. And it has to be quick. I guess without remedy, Mose does not last for a week. Do not worry. I'll bring the pills. Welcome, spies! The soul of Geghi and the spirits of the ancestors are here. We do not ask for forgiveness. We all ask for forgiveness. Forget the spirits of our ancestors. Tonight he will go to Lalkhori. Pray for our son! Cure Mose! Gege, your soul is here, save our boy! Let us pray to the Lord! Turn right. Spirits, we neither stop nor hinder you. We wish you a good journey! Our soul is here now. Curem Mose! Father and Father, you are among us. Spirits, we neither stop nor hinder you. Souls of ancestors, bring peace to us! You who are here. We wish you a good journey! Spirits, we neither stop nor hinder you. Bring us peace! Girshel has gone for five days to get medicine. If he does not come back tonight, we'll have to go. At least one of us will return bringing the medicines. You have to stay strong, eat something. I'm not hungry. We have the Dina remedy! Warm up your fingers, bring hot water. Put your hands in it. Do not bend your fingers. - Clean the snow. - It's in my pocket. Give me the medicine! Scrub your hands continuously! Do not stop scrubbing, bathe with hot water. Keep rubbing put more hot water. "Doctor, do you think it helps?" - You need to believe. Mose, my love... Let's put on the socks. Quick... - First, these here. "And now another. In this foot... First this, now the other... Thank you for saving my son. Forgive me, I will always love you. Excuse me! What's the name? My variant is healed. They do not get sick, Mom, and they did. I'm going to take my son with me. I can understand. We will see you in the summer, you can see us whenever you want. Look at these fox footsteps.
