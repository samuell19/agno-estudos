Mouse! Mouse! Bear! Bear! Let's play with us! Let's go to! Come on out! Let's go play! Nearer! Closer, Kolya! Short! To the left! Turn left! Shrapnel! Give them, Kolya! Give them! Tolerate, tolerate, kinsman. Terps. I woke up. I see. Well done, tanker. Quiet, Quiet, Quiet. Hush hush. Lie down, lie down. You need to lie. Haponin! - All is well. “Are my guys here?” - Everything will be fine. - Senior Lieutenant Gaponin. Brakes. Wow, Lieutenant. Where is the 12th rifle? We are looking for half a day. Yes, damn it now, comrade captain. The offensive has begun. Guys, we’re looking for the 12th Infantry Division. No, we don’t know. Lieutenant, take a closer look there and then in the rear of the Germans dohren still. Got it, comrade captain. Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's! - Come on! - Hold on the heel! I go! I go! Come on! Not all! Took! Your mother ... There is a village. Maybe there is a horse. Senior sergeant Kalashnikov. - Do you have a name? - Michael. You will come with me. And what, machine, look, new? Yes, they did. They say that soon everyone will have this instead of a rifle. This is just fine. And how do you beat? What? Is it working properly? The devil knows him. They’ll send them to the front line, and we'll see. What are you, tanker, keep a distance of 50 meters from me. Well, in which case ... Johan! Johan! Barn! Alive? The machine did not pass the test. Jammed in the most interesting place. Yes, I have seen. Water has entered. It froze today. So the ammo froze. And the spring is weak. Not enough strength to file them. Not finalized. Inventors ... And you, then, understand, or what? Yes, I kind of like too inventor. It seems - in the garden. And what are you inventing? Yes, different. You won’t remember everything. Well, come on from the last. From the last? The dryer for footcloths on bonfire smoke. The dryer ... Her mother ... You yap, tankman. Hello, my dears. Mom, little sister, little sisters Another grandmother Shura, aunt Tatyana and all the villagers, who cares about the fate of the senior sergeant Kalashnikov’s guard. I am writing to you that my tank was hit in battle. The calculation died heroically and I survived by a happy chance, injured in the shoulder. And from that very moment I'm in the hospital for treatment. Since my wound does not stretch well, our doctor Pavel Ivanovich wrote me a vacation and told me to go home until complete recovery. In such circumstances, I begin to move in your direction. Michael. Do you still have the wounded? You, with a hand, come here. Passages. Is your house far, sergeant? Altai. They taught. I am from Kazakhstan. I worked there. Maybe you know Matai station? Matthew? This is before the war. Locomotive depot. True, they kicked me out of there. For what? Yes, he made things different. In general, the authorities did not like it and ... What kind of things? Self-shotguns, shotguns. I have a passion for this since childhood. I’m thinking about a machine now. Machine? Well, an automatic submachine gun. Now. Here. You probably wouldn’t be kicked out right now. On the contrary. Well, they say, Comrade Senior Sergeant, invent health. Our give birth to your inventions are very necessary. Matay Station. Sergeant! Where is he going? Mom, forgive me, you prank me until our meeting. I went to you, but did not reach. Passion missed everyone, I want to roar. I know it's hard for you alone without a father but who will I be before you if I stop respecting myself? I bow to my feet. Your Michael. - And where is Pavel Andreevich? - Moles? He is there. - Pavel Andreevich! - What is Pavel Andreevich? Just a little - Pavel Andreevich. - Pavel Andreevich! - What? Senior Lieutenant Kalashnikov, on leave for the wounded. Kalashnikov ... Kalashnikov ... Something familiar surname. Do I know you? I worked for you in 1938. Repair of steam boilers. All clear. Can you hold a sledgehammer? Not. Rest, rest. “I beg you, little time.” - Give another. Well, I don’t have it. Pavel Andreevich! Rest, I told you. I have nothing for you. Yes. Why is there no shipment? But where will I get these damn valves? Am I writing a complaint about you? Wow. Good. I will be very waiting. Come on. Pavel Andreyevich, while I was lying in the hospital, I was still thinking. The situation at the front is now difficult. The German is well armed, and we, to put it mildly, strongly concede to him in this. The Red Army needs a good machine gun to win. And I have some ideas on this subject. Really? Yes. But what if we take it right here at the depot invent this machine? A? Automatic, you say? Invent? Is it right here? But I remembered you, Kalashnikov. Well, you made your own homemade workplace, huh? That's right, I am. And you know, my friend, what happened afterwards, when did you find your fucking samopal in my workshop? For two days the investigator took my soul out of me. What? Who will allow? For what purpose? Who allowed? I then lost five pounds on this hassle. Well, then your berdanka was not able to shoot. And how to give a drink would be enough. Yes, she still knew how to shoot. Here is such an iron right through. I just then upgraded the shutter. He took off, but did not have time to deliver. Well, good. And for the investigator accept my apologies. What about the machine? Maybe we’ll take a chance, huh? You know what, inventor, wali fucking from here. Comrade Lieutenant, a car for Lieutenant Colonel Basarov has been filed. What is the route? - Let him first to the commandant’s office, then he will tell you. - There is. Listen, what is this, an important bird flown in? Important, important. In the morning at the divorce they said that some inspector from Alma-Ata. Whether Khasanov or Basarov. Are you from the dandy? As there? Hot? Like in the stove. Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, may I? Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, Senior Lieutenant Kalashnikov. Allow to apply? How did you get here, tankman? And I'm on vacation for the wounded. I would have to speak with you, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. Speak, sergeant, just fast. I'm in a hurry. So ... In general, I have confidence here inside, Not that. I have been in the army since 1938. From the first days of the war at the front. 4 wrecked tanks 7 ... No, 8 destroyed anti-tank guns. Could, of course, more, but the hand ... And there it goes ... We also sometimes have to attack, and in hand-to-hand combat. And if a German runs at you with a gun, in which 40 rounds and he can shoot them in a few seconds, and you meet him with a rifle that everyone needs to reload ... “In short, sergeant.” - Yes. Basarov ... Stubborn, then yes? Okay. Give Zhigalova. Sanych, now a Kalashnikov will come up to you, give him a corner there. Yes, table, workbench and tools. Yes OK. Good. I don’t have people. Everything. I have every specialist on the account. Pavel Andreevich, this is a matter of national importance. State? But all this, in your opinion, of what importance? State ... What do you want, your mother, for my steam locomotives to stand? You will not receive a single person and do not even ask. Everything. Listen, do you really want to be serious? Well, which of you is the inventor, Kalashnikov, huh? Well, of course, Basarov felt sorry for you. Saw the guy from the front, wounded, signed a paper to get off as soon as possible. Do not bother to work, I beg you. Go away. Kalashnikov! We are here ... have heard that you invent machines. So? Well. “And you need specialists.” So? - Yes. But Pavel Andreevich said ... Pavel Andreyevich told you during working hours. And after work we can. Zhenya Kravchenko. Milling machine operator. Dmitry Kuzmich, turner of the highest level. Matveich, Volodya, Sanya, Uncle Misha. He matured. - Do not mind? - Not. In general, Comrade Kalashnikov, we all have a strong desire to help you in your righteous deed. Like this. Are there drawings more precisely? Yes, I know, the draftsman of me is useless. So, we’ll do it by eye and customize it locally. Mom, you can’t imagine what big people live here at this small station. Lumps. It’s scary to think what I would do without them. If something really works out of my crazy venture, I’ll immediately go to Alma-Ata, they promised to help there. Sorry, that without details, the matter is secret. But very important. And for me, and, first of all, for our entire country. I bow to my feet. Live and hello. Your Michael. - Eugene, come on. - Come on. This? Thanks then. Sorry. Listen, where lieutenant colonel Basarov? I do not know such. Do you know the deputy military commissar of the republic? What's the matter? I wish you good health. I’m to lieutenant colonel Basarov. Lt. Col. Basarov at the front. - How at the front? - Like this. Wait ... And who is for him? What question are you on? Of national importance. In. Gathered with comrades. In the depot. Out of duty. - Ay, yes hand! Painfully! Yes, you call in Matai. - Sit! Station Matai, head of the depot Krotov. Call, he will explain everything to you. Hey! Hey! What is your state of emergency? Tanker, Comrade Major, with a gun. He tried to break through to a comrade commissar, threatened. Neutralized. - Interrogated? “They decided to wait for you.” Interesting. Spike is not factory. Samopal. I'm in the commandant’s office, I won’t return today. We’ll figure it out tomorrow. Go to Gorokhovaya in the workshop. You will find there such Andrei Ivanovich Kazakov. If you pass this on to him, you will say that Lebedev is asking for an examination. I get it. The fire! Run away, look. - Hello, I wish. - Hello, I wish. How? Second number - not bad, Andrey Ivanovich. But nevertheless accuracy could be better. Let's go to. What a freak? But the devil knows him. Homemade. Major familiar military commissar passed. Look, a curious return mechanism. Don't you find? You see? A completely different solution. Want to experience? Why not? And who is such an inventor here? So I think. What are you laughing at? Don’t be mad at me, sergeant, but you don’t drag on the inventor. You have five classes of parish written on your forehead. Rustic? Well rustic. Inventor! Attention! Comrade Major, there haven’t been any accidents during my duty. - It’s free. - It’s free. Well, your inventor is safe and sound. Release comrade. - Last name? - Kalashnikov. Well, free. Inventor of Kalashnikov. Take it away. Let's go to. Your development is curious but you need to bring it to mind. Improve accuracy, facilitate construction. Have you heard anything about All-Union contests for weapons designers? Do you want the machine launched into production, You need to win such a contest. We will finalize your sample and show it to General Kurbatkin, Commander of the Central Asian District. A man he is sharp, wayward. But if he likes your machine, there will be a competition for you. Well? What do you think? What can I say? In the afternoon, I thought they would put me in prison and now you offer me improve accuracy and lighten the design? Yes. Hell yes. Are you worried? And here is the general. Get up! Comrade Commander. - Well, who is Kalashnikov here? - I AM. Show your invention. Shutter, so start. Cartridge in the barrel. So single so is the turn. How many rounds are there? In this store 14. So it is inserted, so it gets. But there is still a store for 70 rounds, but it is not ready yet. Let's go. Cartridges. Binoculars. Comrade General, maybe a seagull? Kalashnikov! What kind of look, sergeant? Why is the old form? Not in time, Comrade Major General. You say, the general ordered a new uniform to be issued. And then the constructor, you know, but you walk like ... - what the hell. - Yes sir. Remember, Kalashnikov, you are a Turkestan constructor. You will go to the All-Union competition from our military district. I will give you a letter with a personal recommendation. Look, Kalashnikov, don't let me down. I believe in you. Thank you, Kalashnikov, I believe in you. God forbid. You’ll go, he says, from ... You are Turkestan, he says. I can’t say that I used to think about this before. I asked nature about a divine gift, so to speak. I don’t know where it comes from, but I know for sure that there is this gift. He exists. And here a man sits in front of me, whom the Lord God kissed on the top of his head. Mikhail Timofeevich, you are our nugget, for your future success. For the power of Russian weapons. Sorry for not writing for a long time. Spin me like a snowflake. I fly, fly, but I still can’t land. It was already such that I was going to you, my relatives, but I’m not my own boss now. No, of course, I could spit and tear into your arms, but I'm afraid I completely lose respect for myself. And it oh to me as needed. Live and hello. Your Michael. - Are you on the Shchurovsky training ground? - Yes sir. - Throw the sergeant. - There is. Do you want some bread? So what is it with you? Show. - Your? - Mine. Heavy. 120 grams lighter than PPSh. 120 grams. Achievement. PPSh generally weight. On a lintel weak? Without cartridges? Without cartridges. If yours will be put into production, then a bottle of Armenian brandy will come from me. And if mine - climb on the table and you will crow. I agree? I agree. Are you an inventor too? Something like that. - Sudaev Alexey. - Mikhail Kalashnikov. - Crowing, understand? - Got it, got it. “Is there more bread?” - Yes. Thanks. Healthy wish. Please assist Senior Sergeant Kalashnikov in all matters related to his design activities. Without education? So right, without. Do you want to learn, then? I don’t want to? I want to. That is, I am ready. That is, if necessary, then I am ready. Let's go. You will study right at the training ground. We will put your invention in the general competition. Your recommendation is solid. Activities. This is where you will work. Captain! Comrade Colonel, in your opinion ... Get to know each other. Senior engineer Lyuty Vasily Fedorovich. And this is Sergeant Kalashnikov, a talented inventor from Kazakhstan, new contestant. Give him a separate area, Well, full assistance on all issues. - Sure. "Hold on, Sergeant." Here we have Shpagin’s workshop. Spaghetti? Why are you surprised? The front needs a new machine gun, so now all the geniuses of weapons of thought are gathered here. Here Korovin, here Rukavishnikov. Here is the workshop of Vasily Alekseevich Degtyarev himself. Deg ... The same Degtyarev? Of the same. Wait, this is how it turns out: That is, my automatic machine against their automatic machines? It turns out so, sergeant. All in an adult way. Conditions like everyone else. With turners, there is tension, therefore, in the order of a live queue. Yes, and since you’ve been attached to me, Please provide a complete set of drawings for your sample. Blueprints? Just so. Here are no drawings. So you have to draw. Can you draw? Clear. Let's settle down for now. I’ll come to you. Bon Appetit. Are you Kalashnikov? Yes. Ekaterina Moiseeva. Lenya asked to help you with the drawings. I agreed to an extra load. But I have one condition - do not molest. What? Tomorrow I finish at eight. Are you happy at half past eight? - Arranges. - I hope we understand each other. Hey sergeant. Good wishes, Comrade Major. Is your rumble there? That's right, mine. So we are behind you? Who's that? This is a group of Degtyarev. And which of them is Degtyarev? Brother, the master doesn’t go to shootings. Listen, it seems your rattle is jammed. Yes, yes. Hello. “She came as agreed.” - Hello. Weapon for inspection. To the targets. I don’t even know how to thank you. Don’t worry, they will pay me the processing. Wait ... Just don’t leave, I am now. Here. Hold on. This is sugar. Take it, take it. Also - I will see you today. Tomorrow will announce the results. Suddenly I will never see you again? Well, spend it. Dancing. I haven’t been dancing for a hundred years. And I. Allow me to invite you to a dance? And you do not want to ask my gentleman? I think the sergeant will not mind. - Anatoly. - Ekaterina. Senior sergeant. Thank you Thanks. For what? What insisted. I love to dance. And Comrade Senior Lieutenant offered to take me home. And he asked: Who are you to me. And you? She said that we are working together. Katerina, I'm sorry can i accompany you? Today I accompany her. - Really? And it seemed to me ... - It seemed to you. Do you want to ask me? Go away. I won’t leave. I’m not some brainless fool, I won’t let you ... And you act like a fool. Hillbilly. So tomorrow the results will be announced? What will you do if you do not win? I’ll go to the front. I wish you good luck. And thanks for the sugar, my daughter loves sweets. Yes, I have a daughter. And husband? So at the front? I do not have a husband. Sergeant Kalashnikov! Let me congratulate you. Good morning, Comrade Major. Do you want me to crow What are you, friend? I was joking then. I'm a little drunk right now food to Tula to establish the production of its own machine. Congratulations. So ... Come on, do not be discouraged. Lost. It happens to everyone? For some reason I believe in you. Is there something in you ... Come on. Kalashnikov, you’ll still show us Kuskin’s mother. Goodbye. “It doesn't work out for me, Comrade Colonel.” - Shut up. Understand, Kalashnikov, there are no random people here. Captain! Explain to the senior sergeant a new task. Will show off - at the guardhouse for three days. And do not feed. In general, a competition has been announced for the development of a new light machine gun. We want you to start working in Kazakhstan. They know you, appreciate you. And you will continue testing, upgrading here in our design bureau. Well? I agree? Misha! Misha! Yes I agree. Healthy wish. Kalashnikov ... - Comrade General ... - Let's know. They read the telegram. What did not work out? - Did not work out. - Wasn’t it enough? Not catching. Is that enough for a machine gun? So there was no certainty? Here, Kalashnikov, you won’t get off with little blood. All this requires great resources. Money people. And you shrug. Hey. Tell Sasha that Yulia Anatolyevna is waiting for him there. I probably re-read your letter about ten times. It turns out that you not only do not know how to draw, but also write with errors. Apparently, in your childhood, you preferred invention to school lessons. Write that you are waiting for a meeting with me? I don’t know what to answer, Comrade Senior Sergeant. I'll write, perhaps invent your machine gun as soon as possible and come. State Security Captain Lobov, escort. I need Comrade Kalashkin. It's me. Only not Kalashkin, but Kalashnikov. Senior sergeant ... I thought you would be no lower than a major. Is this the same crap? This shit, as you said, is very much awaited at the front. I had this in mind. Not ssy, sergeant, deliver your toy completely safe. Wait here. Kalashnikov! Kalashnikov? A target? Mishanya, are you? Well, everyone is quiet! This is my brother! - Вицька? - Great, brother. What the hell are you doing here, huh? Mishanya, how's mom, little sister? Target! Target! Why are you silent, Mishanya? And I look, you got out of people, but I turned out to be non-lucky. Mommy bow from me. Your documents. Your documents. What's the matter, sergeant? Who is this? Identified. Baba walked on the platform. Do you know how much I paid? In! Drapanula so, already heels sparkled. Come on pour it, sergeant. Thank you, I don’t want, Comrade Captain. I do not ask you, this is an order. What the hell did you want to drink a veteran with an NKVD officer? - I did not say that. - I didn’t say, but I thought. Incidentally, here, in the rear, we are not blowing pears either. An ideological enemy, sergeant, he will be more terrible than a German. This one disguises his pretend and you turn your back, relax he’s hitting a knife in your back! From paskuda ... Hey sergeant, how long do we have? I do not know. I don’t know how? You said a kilometer and a half. Where did you get us, sergeant? Sorry, Comrade Captain, we probably turned the wrong way. Maybe you intentionally turned the wrong way? In what sense? And in that. He called you brother at the station. I, Kalashnikov, eat bread for nothing. I can smell an ideological enemy. Who are you? Senior sergeant Kalashnikov. Well attached: I trust in trust, you invent machine guns. Only you won’t deceive me. I, Contra, will bring you to clean water. Who did you call the counter, bitch? Kalashnikov! Sergeant! Sergeant! Cool? Cool? In all my sins, there is only that I am the son of a dispossessed peasant. So about this, I’m sure where they need to know. And I’m not responsible for my brother. I last saw him in 1936. Alive and thanks for that. Forgot. Following the results of the competition, the commission made the following decision: None of the presented samples of a light machine gun will be accepted for production due to structural discrepancy with the technical specifications of the customer. How technical? Hush, comrades, hush. The competition is declared completed, but ... the war is not over yet. Therefore, to each of the finalists, our bureau will provide an opportunity to prove oneself in work over new weapons. That's all I wanted to say. Everybody's Free. Comrade surgeon, write that I am fit. I beg you, I am the tank commander. I don’t need this hand there. The main thing there is the goal to see and give a command. Do I have any vision? Bottom line. И М Ш Ы Н Б Н К ... Clench your fist. Now stretch out your hand. Tanya, tanya. More more. Yes, lower it. - Comrade Captain ... - Go away, Sergeant. Go away, I say. Misha! Kalashnikov! Sergeant! What doctors say? Clear. Let's go have a smoke. They didn’t take me either. One easy. I can’t run, I am suffocating. And I reviewed the drawings of your machine. There is potential there. There is. I like your approach to business. Rukhov is also not opposed to you working with us in the bureau. While under my leadership, of course. If things go, you'll get your department. Do not rush to answer, think. Think hard. I believe in you. We all believe in you. Do you believe yourself? Sometimes I imagine how I would live then do not get off the train at Matai station. Well, probably lived. You have mushrooms there now. I would bring a whole basket of oil from the forest. And we would gather the whole family in the bath to clean them. You b, mom, started scolding my sister for the fact that she doesn’t take the whole skin off the hat. But Vovka, if he hadn’t died, I would come up with all sorts of different excuses, just to slip away. And you would have regretted it and let it go. - Bear! “And I would sit there with you.” Though all my life. What do you have there? Where? Come on, show it. What? Made it again? Will you help mom? I cant. Misha ... Mom, meet me. This is Misha. Hello, Galina Fedorovna. Hello, hello. I did not get bread today. And Misha brought a loaf of whole. Where were you born? From Altai. Are they temporarily seconded here? It turns out like this. And when the work is over, will you return to your home in Altai? Mom! You forgive me I have no doubt that you are a good person. I love your daughter. I want her to become my wife. Katya, marry me. Victory! Victory! Victory, brothers! - What happened? - Victory! What? Victory? Victory! Victory! Victory! Victory, brothers! - Victory! - Victory! (radio) Congratulations on your victorious conclusion. Great Patriotic War. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Victory! Victory! Do you think the bureau will be closed? And what the hell are these machines now? And I know what we will do in peacetime. Electric meat grinder. What? By the way, the thing in the household is very important. He put the meat, pressed the button - chick! Stuffing is ready. Let's call it a K-1 meat grinder. K - is it Kalashnikov? K is the Kalashnikovs. The idea is mine. Come in. Good morning, Comrade Colonel. Kalashnikovs, entrances, entrances. - With the victory of you. - And you with a victory. Why are you without a front door? At 12 build. So I did not have a full dress. I have a question. All right. If we put so much work into it, is it really all down the drain now? Here are all our thoughts, all hopes. What are you laughing at? On, read. Today came. Supreme commander to provide army and navy the most advanced small arms. Actually, I wanted this document read on the construction, but so be it, I will tell you personally. You can continue the work. But only now in his own department. Here it is first. Do it again. Hello comrades. Hello, Alexey Ivanovich. Damn you, Kalashnikov, growing up. I am trying. “Heard, are you working on a new machine?” - Yes. Lenya, let's go, let them talk. - AMK. “Do you already have a sample?” No, but if the project is approved ... Simpler, easier. Every extra groove, the slots lead to inevitable difficulties in operation. The machine should be as simple as a shot. Exactly. Like a shot. Your PPS-43 is a brilliant thing. - You saw an order to advance the army? - Yes. Next month a competition will be announced for the development of a new machine. And that means that mine, as you put it, is a brilliant PPS, will be in the museum soon. Progress, Kalashnikov, does not stand still. So, we will compete again? If you win, I’ve got a bottle of Armenian from me. Well, why are you upset? You only ride for a year. “That's not the point.” - And what? Carpet ... Arms factory ... Who is in charge of everything there? - General Degtyarev. - Degtyarev ... - So what? “He is my competitor.” Do you think they will let me turn around there? In! They will again select a workbench and a sledgehammer - and let's assemble your machine gun. Misha, you can do it, you’re persistent. Yes, annoying. And the best weapons designer of the Soviet Union. - you think? - Sure. What about the best in the world? Went out! Documents. Hold on. Come on in. Let's drive through. Comrade Kalashnikov, hello. I have been assigned to you. Zaitsev Alexander. We will work together if you do not mind. You do not mind? I'm not against. I’ve only been here for the second week, but don’t worry, I’ve almost gotten used to it. True, shop managers cannot remember me yet. For a messenger take. But that's nothing, I'm not touchy. Who's that? Comrade Degtyarev himself. Well, what a limo he has. A personal gift from Comrade Stalin. Do you know him? With Stalin? No, with comrade Degtyarev. Not. I think I'll meet you soon. Katya, I have an event, I have joy. Inner, hidden, but joy. I share it with you in great secret. Everything seems to add up. Here it is literally literally - develops. Everything falls into place, as if it has always been there. Sudayev was right - everything should be simple. Just like a shot. Only I began to think, so the decision came right away. Bah! As if by the head on the head. I’m sleeping, you understand yourself, badly, I’m worried. I’m terribly afraid. The tank was not so scary as it is now. But at the same time, and joyfully. We are waiting for the first batch. Everything is fine? Well? In the shooting range. But now they are testing samples of Vasily Alekseevich. So we’ll shoot a little. Well, what are you drumming? Designer Kalashnikov. I want to test my sample. Here, samples of General Degtyarev are tested today. I told you. Okay. Have a nice day, everyone. Yes Yes. I will remember that. What? Oh yes! All I can do This is to schedule you on Wednesday. This is the day after tomorrow. Yes, the day after tomorrow you will experience. As you do not understand, I can’t sleep peacefully, until I check how it works. Comrade designer, until Wednesday the shooting gallery is at the disposal of General Degtyarev. Give me a takeaway pass. I will go to the forest, to the quarry. Let me verify that I did everything right. I can’t help you here. The removal of weapons from the territory is prohibited. Can you get cartridges? Ammo? What for? Hey moron! What are you doing? Cease fire immediately! Well, put it down! Put down your weapon! Who shot? Left. Comrade General, Senior Sergeant Kalashnikov delivered at your order. Let him come in. Major, free. There is. And I remember you, Kalashnikov. Then the competition in 1943 was won by Sudaev. But I remembered your machine gun. Of course, as a combat specimen, he was, to put it mildly, crappy, but like a home-made made of a piece of iron in a barn, impressed. Is it true that you haven’t studied anywhere? So for sure, I haven’t studied anywhere. Self-taught. Yes, you sit down, Senior Sergeant, sit down. I would like to see your new machine before the start of the test. - Comrade General ... - Don’t be afraid. I know that designers do not like to show each other their designs. Don’t worry, I’m just not able to steal your brilliant ideas. My machine is already assembled, it is already being prepared for shipment to the landfill. I am just curious. It's funny. Every detail just asks for its place. I think sending my assault rifle to the test makes no sense. This design is more promising. The design of Senior Sergeant Kalashnikov is much more promising. Comrade General, what to do with your sample? Lock up. So that no one sees. There is. Bulkin sample. Ready. Proceed to the test. Fire on readiness. Delay - not ejection. Sample Dementieva. - Ready. - Proceed to the tests. Fire on readiness. Misfire - locking the bolt frame. Sample Kalashnikov. Fire on readiness. He worked normally. Continue the test. Fire on readiness. Misha! - Well? - The tests were successful. Come on! Why aren’t you happy? I am glad. I am pregnant. Not! Relax! Relax! - Awarded? - I wish you good health. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Congratulations. “Congratulations, Sergeant.” - Thanks. Voronov. Attention. Artillery Marshal Ravens. Good morning, Comrade Marshal. - Kalashnikov ... - Good health, comrade Marshal. - How are you feeling? - Cheerful. Vigorous is good. Well done. You’ll remember the first prize forever. I decided where to spend the money? I did not think about it, comrade Marshal. Colonel, I’m taking the sergeant, I’ll return it in the evening. “Listen, Comrade Marshal.” - In the car. Go. It’s time for you, Kalashnikov, to raise your profile move from sergeant to officer. What kind of education? Unfinished, Comrade Marshal. Seven classes. You’re just like Lomonosov - you came from Moscow to Arkhangelsk on foot. Where are you from? From Altai. Haven't been home for a long time? So long ago that I’m afraid I don’t recognize mom at the meeting. So you need to go. So who will let me go now? I thought I would win the competition - they would give me a vacation. And it turns out - I now have work for ten years in advance. We serve the fatherland, sergeant. Fatherland. It’s beautiful in Altai now, right? Handsomely. Regiment, be equal. Attention. Equal to the middle. Comrade Chief Marshal of Artillery, the personnel of the combined rifle regiment is built. Regiment commander Major Ivanov. Hello comrades. Good morning, Comrade Chief Marshal. Congratulations on your successful new small arms test. Hooray! We are proud of our outstanding designers, the creators of powerful modern weapons that helped us defeat the enemy. The names of Lieutenant General Degtyarev, designers of Tokarev, Simonov and Sudaev, forever inscribed in the world history of weapons. But today I want to introduce you to a young but a very talented designer, Stalin Prize laureate Senior Sergeant Kalashnikov. His AK-47 assault rifle is the future of the weapons world. Thank you for the service. Serving the Soviet Union. Congratulations. Your vacation order will be signed tomorrow. Go home, son. Mothers bow deeply from me. It’s free. It’s free.
