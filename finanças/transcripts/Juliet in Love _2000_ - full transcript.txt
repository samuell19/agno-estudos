A Coke, please. I want the big bottle. Do you have it? Why don't you take this instead? OK... no, I want Coke. Coke? —Do you have any? —Yes. Do you have the bottled ones? Bottled Coke? —Bottled coke... no. —No? —Oh you mean those in glass bottles? —Yes, those. —I have those. —How much is it? —Six dollars. —OK. —How old are you, Granny? —I'm eighty plus. Eighty plus? —Do you want me to open it? —Yes, please. Wait. Forget it. I'll drink it back at work. —Okay. Do you need a straw? —Yes. Thanks. Eighty plus? You look healthy. Not really. I just went to see a doctor last night. Really? What's wrong? Oh, the usual ailments old folks like us get. Flu and whatnot. —I see. Bye, Granny. —Bye. What did the doctor say? He said the cancer has started to spread. They have to remove one breast. When is the operation? I'll get it done before our divorce. Judy, our divorce isn't because... I pass by here every day. It's always so crowded. I've always wanted to ask the crowd... if they have any idea what they really want. Because I've no idea what I want. But it doesn't matter. The second race. $200 on number thirty-five to win. That's right... Another one? Let me do the introductions. This is my boyfriend... or at least that's what he wishes to be. He's my godbrother, Jordan. This is my new godsister, Hoi Yee. Hoi Yee? Hello, I'm Lam Ka Wah. Hi... Where are you from? LA. Los Angeles. I haven't gone back for a long time. —Really? —Really... Yes, well, I'm a... —I'm an actress. —Oh really? Yes. —Fix this up first. —I want you to fix this by yourself. —Come with me right now, or else... —Let's talk this through... Ignore them. Hey, I know what. Why don't we watch some of the shows I'd acted in? —Your shows? —Yes. Sure... Is that really you? She looks much older. No, that's really me! —Look closer. —You're right. —Very dangerous. —Yeah! Very, very dangerous. You know? Yes... wow. I'm... I'm really... I'm really happy that we can watch movies in bed together so soon... after getting to know each other. You just got here. Please sit over there and wait. If you can't wait, go somewhere else for dinner. Table for two, right? Okay... Judy, I'm swamped. Come back quick. Stop squabbling! You just have to wait. Our seats are limited. —Judy! —Coming. We're preparing a big table for you. Please wait for two more minutes. It'll be ready in a short while. Thank you. (Lisping) I'm Chan. I've booked a table for three at seven. —Mr Chan, seven-thirty reservation. —Okay. Mr Chan, this way please. —How many in your party? —Four. Please take a seat over there first. Thank you. Miss Judy, we came all the way from Chai Wan to eat here. Please have a seat. It will be your turn soon. We took a ten-hour flight from Chai Wan to get here. After this, we'll have to take another ten-hour flight back to Chai Wan. Was that supposed to be funny? —Hey, what's wrong with you? —I'm sorry... —I need to throw up... —What a jerk! Take a seat... (Lisping) I've seated Mr Chan in the VIP room. Get back to work. (Lisping) Crazy girl! —What's the joke? —Instructor Fong. You can just call me Fong. —How many in your party? —Two. It's a busy night. You might need to wait for about fifteen minutes. —Take a seat first. —That's okay. Do you want some chestnuts? You're having dinner soon. Don't spoil your appetite. But these are delicious. —Go and have a seat first. —Okay. One-four-one. —Show them to their table. —Okay. Yes. One-three-nine. Pay attention to the front. Signal right, check your mirror and turn right. Thank you, Instructor. How may I help you? Hi, Lily. My surname's Cheng. I've made a seven-thirty reservation for a table of eight. —Mr Cheng? —Yes, I'd left my contact number too. 94135678. —What's the matter? —You're Mr Cheng? —Do I need to show you my identity card? —He said he's Mr Cheng. I just remember. My surname's Cheng. I'd reserved a table of eight for 7.30pm. My phone number is 94135678. You're Mr Cheng? Then who's he? Brother On! Brother On. How would I know? Anyway, I'm Cheng, I have a reservation. —Fine. Call me. —Okay. What's he doing? 94135678. Hello? Yes. Is everything okay? Mr Cheng? I couldn't get a table. Sorry. Thank you. What a coincidence. We share the same surname. I tried jumping the queue because I'm starving. Sorry... Do you think I'll let you off just like that? —Go up with Granny first. —Okay. I'll show you to your table. If you're not happy, we can always talk things over. My friends have nothing to do with this. Let them off. I'll wait for you. Go. —Can you handle this alone? —Just go. I'll be fine. I'll just sit here and wait. It's no big deal. Take care of the girls. I'll be waiting for you. Don't drink so much. —I'm leaving. Bye. —Bye. Hello? Hey, I'm still waiting for you. —How much longer will you take? —I'm still eating. Well, can you just tell me who you are? You shouldn't be running around. That man keeps losing. He throws "scissors" all the time. Brother On. She's only doing her job. Can you at least tell me who you are? My dad is Brother On of New Territories. I'm sorry. Hello, Brother Man? What's up? Ka Wah... —I'm playing pool. —Ka Wah! Hurry up! Sorry. The betting odds, hurry! Today's betting odds... Arsenal is giving Coventry a one-ball handicap... with Arsenal's odds at one point nine. Grandpa. You're drinking Coke again? No Coke, no hope. But you're still coughing. Only a little. You should wait till your cough is gone before you drink Coke. Please... —Just a few sips? —Yes, but wait till you've recovered. —A little bit, okay? —Okay... What? Try on this pair of new slippers. See if it fits. No wonder I couldn't find my old pair. What a pretty colour. It's beautiful. —I think it's too big for you. —Not really. Be honest with me. Slippers don't have to fit perfectly. Hey, no! —Small? Can do? —No can do. You've already drunk half the bottle. No more, all right? I'll drink the rest. Don't be mad. I'll put this in the fridge. —You can drink it tomorrow. —Okay. —You can have it for breakfast, okay? —Okay! All right, go to bed now. I love this pair of slippers. Did it cost a lot? —Was it expensive? —I don't know. Yeah, right. How would you not know? You bought it. Or is this a gift from Fourth Auntie next door? You must be interested in her! I spent the whole night watching tapes with that girl. But she acted coy and I couldn't get her into bed. The last girl I slept with fell straight into bed with me... within minutes after we met. Darn it. Thank you. —Good morning. —Good morning, Instructor Fong. Does your godsister know any girls, who are very well-endowed? Can't you tell me? Come on. Don't worry if you get a puncture. Use a lug wrench and loosen the wheel nuts. Do not raise the car yet. Fit the wrench to a wheel nut and try to loosen it. It's all right if the nut is too tight. Make sure the wrench is level and turn it clockwise. Do I need to know this to get a driving licence? No, but you're already quite adept at driving. So I thought I'd teach you something else. If I'm that good, I wouldn't have failed my driving test twice. That's because you got too nervous. If you don't get so nervous, you'll definitely pass. Don't worry, I won't charge you for this extra hour. That's not what I meant, Instructor Fong. Anyway, I won't charge you for this hour. If I fail my driving test again, I must really consider changing my instructor. Settle your nerves and you'll be fine. If you fail again, don't tell anyone I'm your instructor. —If not, I'll lose all my students. —I was just kidding! Signal right and start your car. Drive to the petrol station at the road junction. —I'll teach you how to pump a tyre. —What? Yes. Since you already know how to drive... I'll teach you how to pump a tyre. It may come in handy in future. I won't charge you for this hour. Don't worry. It's okay, Instructor Fong. I was kidding you just now. —Hello? —Hello? Where are you? I'm shopping in Yuen Long. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I'm telling you now, aren't I? You must learn to be independent and lead your own life. All right, I'm hanging up. I'll call you when I'm free. Let me carry these for you. —Who was that? —Someone you don't know. —Holy crap! —Stop! Stand right there! Do you know what you are? You're a vending machine. I've inserted my coins twice. Where's my drink? —Hello? —Hello? I ran into Pang. He wants us to pay him back at once. Don't hang up. I'm heading there now. I'll be there soon. Where exactly are you now? Yuen Long? Yuen Long, please. Yau Sun Street, Kin Lok Street... —Turn into Hup Yick Road. —No hurry but please be quick. It's settled. Go ahead and tuck in. Please pull over. Thank you. Judy! What's wrong? The hospital, please! Wait for me, driver. I'm Chu Tong's granddaughter. You called me just now. Where is he now? He's in the emergency room now. Please wait over there. This was found at the scene of the accident. —Hello? —What's taking you so long? —Get here right away. —I'll be there soon. I need the location of Yau Sun Street and Kin Lok Street. Over. I've told you to turn into Hup Yick Road. Where is Hup Yick Road? Hello, Ka Wah? Where exactly are you? The driver doesn't know how to get there. What landmarks do you see? Transport Plaza. Just turn into On Lok Road. —No... don't turn into that road. —Why not? —Then he'll have to go past Kai Di. —That's on the way here. But it's a longer route! Give me the phone. Hello? Hello? He hung up. What kind of crappy network is this? Hello? Where are you now? I'm still on the taxi. Can you see Hup Yick Road? I don't even know where Hup Yick Road is. Hup Yick Road? We just went past it. Why didn't you turn into it? I told you to! Mister, you mentioned Yau Sun Street, Tung Lok Street... and Fung Cheung Road. Where exactly do you want to go? It's okay... I've found my way. Could you kindly turn back to Hup Yick Road, please? Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Do you need me to wait for you? —What? —Should I wait? Sure, if there aren't any other passengers. Sorry. It took me a while to find my way here. Are you guys done? My boy is getting sleepy. Boss! Boss. Boss, these are the two fellas... who haven't paid up their soccer betting debts. Couldn't you have hit him without making so much noise? It's okay... Get lost! Don't be scared. Everything's all right... Stop staring at me or you'll be next! It's all right, don't be scared... Collect the money and get him out of here. I have no money. But you said he has the money! I just assumed he'd have some. You're asking for it, you... Leave him alone. Let me think of something, okay? All right, don't cry... have something to eat. Don't look at him. Here, have some food. Daddy, that man's bleeding. That's because he has been naughty. Do you want to be naughty like him? No, I'll be good. What should we do if someone is bleeding? Send him to the hospital. How do you spell hospital? —H-O-S-P-O. Hospital. —Smart boy! Here. Cheers! H-O-S-P-I-T-A-L. Hospital. I can't come up with anything. My head is killing me. Does anyone have painkillers? I'll give you seven days' grace. Show up with the money by then. Anyone there? We need help. Help! He needs help! Any nurses around? What's the matter? Don't make a din here. —He's bleeding, what should we do... —Calm down. Get the nurses here. Hurry! Please save him... Come here. I need to get a statement from you. Are you all right? —Why are you here? —I haven't left at all. How do we pay off our debts? I'll ask Chee Hung to negotiate with them... I've already tried that. But he's busy putting out his own fires now. What should we do? Mister, I've got to get out of here before I can figure out what to do. It's pointless for you to sit here. Go now... Will you be fine staying here by yourself? Of course! I have the whole hospital to keep me company. I'm off then. Thank you for last night. No worries. How's your grandpa? Is he all right? I'm waiting for him to regain consciousness. He'll probably wake up soon. Is it your day off today? —It's almost time for me to go. —Find someone to cover your shift. You have other colleagues, haven't you? Well, since I'm just in the next bed, I'll look after him for you. I'll call you at the restaurant if anything happens. Work comes first. Thanks. I'm off to work then. Bye. Can I have a bottle too? Are you hungry? Well, no Coke for you then. Mister, this way please. —Ho Wai Restaurant. —Hello? Your grandpa has just... he has just... regained consciousness. He wants some noodles. Okay. I didn't say I wanted noodles. It's Jordan who wanted it. This isn't enough. Wow, perfect. —Some more soy sauce, please. —Okay. Eating soy sauce might leave you with a scar. It's no big deal for men to have scars. I'll look more imposing and fearsome with a scar. You ought to bring your grandpa here to try the food. No way. Is it that big a deal? He's the only family member I've left. Life is predestined. If he can come out to eat here, that will mean he's fine, right? Here are two dozen bottles of Coke. —Thanks. —Enjoy. I'm out of here. Don't ever let your granddaughter find out. If she does find out, don't tell her it's from me. —You know how sharp she is. —So what? The two most important things to a woman are her health and family. That will make her complete. But she has neither. Let me tell you something. As long as there's Coke, there's hope. Get me a bottle of Coke. No more. You've already drunk two bottles today. Come on, just one more. Where's your identity card, Boss? I'll do the registration. Your identity card, Boss. —Where's the baby? —He's with Brother Tai. Your wife won't see him. Lower your voice. Hey, did you see my boss? He's on the second floor, waiting for a blood transfusion. Mrs On. —Is this that woman's baby? —No. It's my friend's. Isn't he cute? —Where is On? —Mrs On! —You can't go in. —Where's On? Let me in! —How's my son? —Don't worry, Boss will handle it. Please leave or things will just get worse. —Leave or your son will be in danger! —Get On to call me. —Sure... just go! —Is your blood type O negative? —Why? —One of our patients is badly injured. He needs a blood transfusion. Please help us out. Is it that guy who came in with his men? Please help! This is a big hospital, how could there not be enough O negative blood? We transfused it all to you! H-O-S-P-I-T-A-L. Hospital. Brother On is receiving a blood transfusion now. Nurse, do you need O negative blood? I can donate my blood. Someone has already donated. Thank you. When my new restaurant opens, I'll get you over to help. Thanks. Take care of the baby for me for a few days. What? Are you serious? The debt you owe me... we'll halve it. Thank you for your concern. Bye. Let's go, Boss. Mrs On. I can't stop you from fooling around. But you shouldn't have let me find out. You know I have a hot temper. Next time, I'll stab lower. I'll see how you can fool around by then. Mind what you say, our boy is here. What are we going to do? Just take care of him for now. I have nothing for the baby at home. I need to buy some stuff, Boss. —What do you need? —Stuff for him. What does the baby need? —Milk powder and diapers? —Okay. He's a boy. Diapers are unisex. How old is he? A few months old, I guess. —It's okay. —Take this then. Not this one, it's branded. Get me that one. That's cheaper. But that's for adults. What's the difference? Yes... how much for a newborn? Half an ounce for newborn... What? Oh, two ounces? Okay, two ounces. He isn't a newborn. He's about six months old. Six months old... or thereabout. —It's not dissolving. —How much? Wait... how much? Double the amount for a six-month-old? Okay. What do I do if the milk powder doesn't dissolve? I did use hot water. Fill the bottle with hot water before adding the milk formula. How many times does he need to be fed? What? Just give me a moment. The betting odds... Manchester United... Man U is giving a half-goal handicap, with odds at one point eight five. You don't like the odds? Call back later then. I'll call you if the odds change. I've gotten it wrong again. —Add hot water... —Hot water followed by milk powder. Two-and-a-half scoops. Isn't that a bit too much? That guy has nine kids. What do we do? You do it. That will be cruel. I'm asking you to wake him up, not chop him up. But he's sleeping so soundly. He hasn't eaten anything the whole day. You do it then. I can't do it. You do it. Don't panic. —All right, I'm going off. —Hey! What about him? You're the one who brought him back. Aren't you going to look after him? —You're doing a good job. —I have to work tomorrow. —What then? —I'll come and take over tomorrow. No way! Stay here tonight. I... I can't handle him by myself. You got it all over his face. Better clean him up. Good night. Hush, don't cry... Are you hungry? Why aren't you looking after him? What can I do? He refuses to drink the milk. He'll stop crying when he's tired. Hush, don't cry... Don't bring him back if you don't want to look after him. Do you think I had a choice? Just let him cry. What's the big deal? His parents don't seem to care, so why should I? Hey, come and soothe him. Don't cry... be good... I've got to go. Call me if you need me. It wasn't intentional, I swear. You're scaring me. I'll get you some medicine to stop the bleeding, okay? It worked that time someone smashed a glass bottle on my head. Hush, don't cry. Here... We'll just use this for now, okay? —Good boy... —Grandpa. Have a sip. Hush, be good... Who got you the Coke? No Coke, no hope. —Don't drink so much, please. —I told you we don't have any. —Stop it! —Come on, this is a hospital. I just need some ointment for the baby... Stop it! —You're nuts. —Crazy man. And you guys claim to be all compassionate and caring in the ads. Nightingale? Nonsense. What's wrong with you? We were dragon boat racing. It's bound to be a bit dangerous. Why is he so quiet? Has he fainted? Grandpa! Stop drinking. —No Coke, no hope. —Here, have some soup. —You wanted ointment, right? —Yes, put it here. Thanks. Name, please? I need it for registration. Just check my records. Not you! The baby! Let's call him Siu Dong. But Siu Dong sounds too feminine. Let's call him Siu Sai then. That's a manly name. Siu Sai... that's a guy's name. His surname is Cheng... Let's call him Cheng Lek (meaning "very smart") then. It sounds good and has great meaning too. Right, Cheng Lek? What do you think? So if his surname is Ma, you'd name him Ma-donna? If his surname is Tong, I'll call him Tong Cruise. —Look, train. —I'm off to work. Bye, Cheng Lek. All right, let's go home. Shall we go home, my boy? Do you have my house keys? No. —Don't cry. —Okay... Don't cry. You miss her? —He misses you already. —Bye. All right... let's go home for milk. Hush, we're going home right away... One, two, three, four... —Table for two. —For two? This way please. Leave it to me. I told you we'll have a great time. What's wrong? Are you locked outside? Why didn't you tell me you'd be home late? And your cell phone is switched off. We were bathing at the bathhouse. I couldn't leave my cell phone on. What could I do? Leave him alone at home? Look at how much he enjoyed his bath. Where are my keys? He pooped. Hey, come over here. He pooped. Come on... Go and wash your hands. Look at you. You've pooped everywhere. There's poop all over his towel. Yes? It doesn't matter. Be careful. Hey, let's take a picture with the baby as memento. —I've inserted the coins. Come on! —What for? Do you owe him a lot of money? Why do you ask? I can settle it for you. Yeah, right. I owe him $100,000. I know you'll pay me back when you have the money. Okay, if you trust me enough to do that. It doesn't matter. —It doesn't matter. —If you say so. Do you want to pinch her face? Go on, pinch her face. That's right... Go on, pinch her. Why don't you look happy today? I'll pinch you then. Here. Take it and pay off our debt. Where did you get so much money from? I have my ways. Get going. What are you waiting for? Should I throw you into the river while you're asleep? Should I throw you in? All right, don't frown. Move it left. —That's right. —When do I stop? Yes, right there. Now, go straight... —Like this? —Yes, go straight. —When do I stop? —Stop. Right there. This should be okay. We might have stopped a little bit too early. Yes, we did. It's okay. I'll go and get more coins. Don't bother. It's all right. It's okay, I don't mind. I have a riddle for you. A girl had forgotten the passcode to the electronic lock... on the main gate of her apartment. From afar, she saw a man entering the gate. So she sprinted towards the gate, hoping to get in before it closes again. But the man went in and the gate closed before she could get in. So the girl was stuck outside as there was no one else around. But not long after that, she managed to get in. How did she do it? The watchman opened the gate for her. There wasn't anyone around. She got her family members to let her in. She lives alone. She opened it with her keys. It's an electronic lock. You can't unlock it with a key. I don't know. Strange, isn't it? After the man entered the gate, she pressed the "redial" button. That's how she got in. It's quite lame, isn't it? No, it's quite funny. Let me ask you another riddle. There's a man and a woman, who are complete strangers. But they live together with a baby. What do you think is going on? So what's the answer? The answer? Well, I was just wondering. It's not what you think it is. What I think it is? I don't think anything about it. Whatever you say. Time for work. That's right. Go straight... go. Slowly... stop. This should work. Have you been a good boy today, Mr Lek? Here, I'll tell him a bedtime story. I attempted suicide before. When a woman loses one of her breasts... as well as her family after her husband left her... she has nothing left, doesn't she? You still have your grandpa. I don't even have that. I'm serious. My whole family's dead. We're from the same parents... but my younger brother got all the care and attention. He got to go study abroad in England but I got nothing. One summer holiday, they visited him in England... and toured Paris together. I'd told them not to drive Japanese cars. A Volvo hit their car head-on. The Volvo got away with barely a scratch... but my whole family died. I've always wanted to ask them... why they excluded me, even in their deaths? Why didn't they count me in? We were a family, weren't we? It's no big deal. It doesn't matter. Why? You can't mix it this way. It will get all foamy. Let me do it. He's drinking more than usual today. Usually it's two ounces of formula for newborns... but he drinks four ounces each time, four times a day. —Five times if he's still hungry. —That's fine. —Kids nowadays... —They're really lucky, aren't they? Take him out. It doesn't look stable. What if he falls? Come on, your daddy's here to see you. Look, Cheng Lek. —Who's Cheng Lek? —We call him Cheng Lek. Since his surname is Cheng... and he looks like a smart ("Lek" in Cantonese) boy... so we call him Cheng Lek. What's his actual name? —Cheng Lek sounds pretty good. —Yes, it does. Cheng Lek. Come here... Cheng Lek. What are your plans? I'm just asking. What did you say? I was asking you what your plans are, for... Beats me. He can't stay in Hong Kong, but I don't feel good leaving him in Mainland China. What do you think? You never should have done what you did. It's easy for you to say. Have you been to Mainland China? Not much. I've been fooling around for over 20 years. First time I burnt my fingers. China is a pretty great place. There are lots of options and things there are cheap. Have you received love letters before? No? Love letters are really hard to write. And you know what's worse? They aren't interested in your money. They want love and the whole shebang. Do you reply to their love letters? Why is there a reddish patch on his head? It's a birthmark. It's been there since I first got him. My baby, I love you. I love your mom too. We'll have a good time together. Your name is Cheng Lek. Hey, I'm off. "Mahjong. Billiards" Hey, we're in trouble. I was robbed, the $100,000 is gone. —Are you kidding me? —I'm serious. I had the runs that day after you passed me the money... so I went to a toilet. Look at all that money! —Grab it! Let's go... —Run... That money wasn't mine. I know that! You don't believe I'd been robbed? It doesn't matter. That means you don't believe me! —It's not that. —I'll find those scumbags! I want the purple one. That purple one. Here's $140. The purple one, please. Boss, I won't take this lying down. Two of my men are still in hospital. One with a broken leg and another with internal bleeding. They robbed me. They deserve to be beaten. I taught them a serious lesson. I broke their legs. Boss, just look at what they did to your men. Are you going to take it lying down? Give me your word, Boss, and I'll settle it. So what do you want? Boss, I don't want to bother you with this. I'll let him off if he compensates us for this. It's only fair, isn't it Boss? How much do you want? $100,000. Non-negotiable. He wants $100,000. Do you have it? There are no tables available. What then? I'll transfer the money to your account tomorrow. —My wife is seeing another man. —Really? I don't know but I have to do something about it. What should I do if she's really cheating on me? Yeah. You should get someone to fix it for you. Good idea. Break his legs for me. You have lots of followers, surely you won't need me to do it? This is my family affairs. I don't want to make it public. Just help me out one more time. Okay, it's no big deal. I'll do it. I owe someone $100,000. Can you help me with that? —Okay, it's a deal. —Thanks. —I'll call you again. —Okay. "Couple die in charcoal-burning suicide" It doesn't matter. Nothing seems to matter to you. But can you accept a woman who looks like this? Wait for me. I'll be home for dinner. I feel good, just a little cold. At least I finally know what matters... and what I really want. Granny, I changed my mind. Please open it for me. I want to drink it now. You're pretty strong. —Thank you. —You're welcome. I'll come by when I'm free.
