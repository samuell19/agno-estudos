Now we must make it known. - What a beautiful edition! Cloth and gold. - Yes. Well, are you able to sell it? Well, the truth is I don't know ... What is it about? It's an old manuscript. We have a treasure in our hands. If you are able to sell it, We will earn lots of money. "Mysteries, Legends and Murders of the Emilianenses castles. " "Prophecies, divinations and curiosities." "Mysteries, Murders and Prophecies of the Ancient and noble family of Emilia Romagna ". I get it. But, to whom will it be sold? Take this.

How many copies do you want to get started? - I'll take them all. - All? - Yes. - Good! Have you brought the money? - Money, what for? - The money?! Do you think I'm going to give you the books with just your word? If you want to take them, you have to pay in advance. - Do you have the money? - Yes, Yes. Here you go. That's all? You see, with this I can only give you two copies. Well then two. Satisfied? Very! Well, come on. To work! And may you go with God. EVERYONE DECEASED ... EXCEPT THE DEAD. Is anyone there? Hey, Mrs. Marquesa! Are you there? The Marquis is giving his last breath. Better him than us. Here it is! Thank you. The priest has already been called. What agony! He became all sweaty, and began to bleed again. - Poor man ... bleeding again ... - Yes I know. - Does it matter? - Oh, it matters. Anyway ... Anyway they're having a party tonight, you'll see. So let's have fun too. Come on. Eat! It's good. Who's there? Is anyone there? Take that! - How? What is it? - A good stab, didn't you see? Oh, someone's finally responding. Good evening. Good evening. Marquesa Zanotti? I wish ... I'm the half-servant. - Are you really a dwarf? - You're joking! - Come in. - Thank you. You're here because of the "misfortune", right? What misfortune? This morning the Marquis Ignazio died, our master. - He was suffering ... - Was there a death? Then I'd better come another day. My condolences, in any case. You are welcome. Finally you've come. Why did you arrive so late? I'll be down right away. Just a moment, dear, and I'll be with you. - Who is she? - The Marquesina Ilaria. Thank you for coming, my dear ... My dearest one. Thank you. I'm really moved. You're the only one who remembered. Look, do you want to see it? The poor one ... - It's over. - Who? - Come with me. Papa's up there, he's watching us. Who knows how happy he will be to see you here. Come, come. Here are all the others. Come in. Ottavio, I'll wear the veil tomorrow: They will die of rage. It will be a precious funeral ... It comes to Donald. Imagine ... Imagine how diverting! The usual madness of Ilaria. Have you seen what a pleasant surprise? Look who I brought. Who is he? Come. Good evening, young man. Oh thanks. Thank you for the nice gift. You will undoubtedly remember my wife, Letizia. Good evening. - No, but... - Ah, no? Good good... My nephew. Ilaria's brother. - My name is Ariano. - Ariano? In homage to the purity of the race. Shut up! And stop talking nonsense. Do you think that now you can order us? You monarchists have gone wrong in the elections. It is clear that what you are today You owe to that bastard King! He was that high. Why don't you sit next to me? - Sit down. - Yes. Ilaria, you have chosen the right moment to bring home one of your lovers. The truth is that I ... Have you had dinner yet? What? I asked you if you had already eaten. - No ... Actually, I'm very hungry. - Very good. We only have roast. - Moron! - Hold on. - Give him a drink, at least. You know? We also have almost no wine left. The good man that died drank it all before us. In short, we no longer swim in gold. Uncle, please ... He was the greatest child prodigy of his time, and I'm convinced he will remain so. - Still the same. - Especially physically. A dance? Certainly. The orphan has been comforted quickly ... Of course. These things happen. Is he a dancer? Will he be a dancer? Pay attention for a moment, please! - Miss Donald's latecomer has arrived. - Welcome, welcome! Donald! Look who's advising that idiot from Switzerland ... What an absurd thing! - Is it snowing outside? - No, he's from Switzerland. Dear Donald, you look very well. - You look splendid! - Is he a friend? No no. Step brother, from my father's second marriage. You know, Papa's mistake. I see that you've recovered. - Hello, Donald. - Hello. Hello, Ilaria. Hi Uncle. Hi Aunt. I find you very well. - Is he a prisoner? - No no no! It's just a sexual restraint. It's a Swiss therapy against masturbation. You know, he was going blind using his hands so much. - Come on, I'll introduce you. - I get it... - This is my brother Donald. Also Known as "the masturbator". - Exactly! - Hello dear. - Hello. - How are you? - I have the handcuffs on, so I'm already cured. I get it. I see that your brother is very much in his right mind. I'm healed. I'm almost healed. - Well of course. - Very good! Excuse me. But I think it would be better if Donald retires. He's tired ... and would like to be well for tomorrow's funeral. - Come on. - Your upstairs room is ready. - Goodnight! - Good night, stupid asshole! Have a nice rest. Can I ask the ladies not to wear light clothes in front of Donald? A relapse could be fatal. - I will not give up my low-cut dress. - Well said! - True, true. - Come on. Yes, I'm leaving, too. Where are you going at this hour? It has been a pleasure. We will not see each other anymore. - Are you absolutely sure you want to leave? - The steering wheel? - Come back, please ... You must forgive me, but I ... I can't remember Where we met. Actually, I've never seen you before. But, you see, your appearance in my life ... has disturbed me. You understand, don't you? I get it. I, my little brother, I'm always alone in there. Do you know that I sleep naked? Hey, I came ... To sell a book. Not to find ... How to say ...? - Love? - Love, that. And you couldn't find it now? - I can not ... - Oh, come on, silly ... - I have to go ... - Please. - Why? - Please! I have to go. - Then leave! Don't be angry, miss. What should I do? Go away? Yes. Goodbye! Did you see it? We were lucky. - Do you believe in fate? - I prefer the horoscope. Well, don't worry, I will find a solution. - Good. - Maybe ... In my bedroom. That handsome man ... Is he your father? Why is he wearing those clothes? An ancient family tradition. A stupid one. He always dressed like that for the ceremonies in the Vatican. He looks like you. Oh. Should I take that ... as a compliment? Not in front of Papa. But ... even Papa Would be glad to see me With a man as handsome as you. Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Don't do that! - But ... - My heart already has an owner. - Oh? I'm engaged to Janet, a famous, very famous, stewardess of Alitalia. She is faithful to me. To think we have been promised for 32 years ... And she has never laid a hand on me. A... A lady. Very good! Really that's just right! Deep down is just right! Anyway, I'm no more than a stranger to you! Goodbye! And where do I sleep? Here? Tell me ... What are you doing? What are you doing? You leave me alone with your father? - My little one ... My sweet little fool. - Good... Isn't that Janet ?! Did she see us? I've put on the mastrubation guard. But I've taken off your handcuffs. Are you happy? And you, aren't you undressing? - I'll sing a lullaby. - Sleep with Donald, come on! - Sleep with Donald, come on! - Be good. - Tonight, Donald will be good. - Try to be good. - I know... - Tonight Donald won't touch. - That's what you always say ... - I won't discharge, I won't discharge. - Yes. - Yes, but you know them all. - Tonight, Donald will be good. - I don't believe you, and you know it! - Tonight, Donald won't touch. - No discharge, no discharges ... - Goodnight. - Sleep well. - Tonight, Donald will be good. - Goodbye. - Tonight, Donald will not touch. I'm dying to go home. We'll go tomorrow, after your brother's funeral. Do you hear me? - Yes, woman, yes. - Understand? That idiot Ignazio didn't leave us a lira, With all the airs of grandeur that was shown. Not a lira! Do you want to make love? I'd prefer to die. Well? You know what? I'm very tired, I have to read you the papers, I have ... I have to fill the boxes. What will you do when I die? - Will you at least learn the signature, yes or no? - Shut up and write! "Whoever writes to him ..." "has already tried to keep him here," "so that you will know about things So terrible that are about to occur. " "No one will be able to stop death." "He who is determined, is prepared for everything. " "Call the police, Quick, help! " "On this castle there is a curse. " "And there are those who are resolved to carry it out. " What are you doing? You aren't writing anymore? I'm scared. Go on, slave! "Crimes, many crimes await us. " "Only you can stop them." Signed ... Me! Do you want me to sign an anonymous letter? That's true... Fold it and send it to "you-know-who". We can't do it. We can't betray him. He promised us that nothing would happen to us, and that he would not hurt us. - And now I'm going to tear up this letter! Understand ...? You understand? - Give it to me! I don't trust you. I'm afraid too. You shouldn't have done that, Rosa! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Calm down, come on. You see? When you calm down, you're prettier? Wait a minute. I stole this from our masters. To celebrate. Ready, all set! This one. To our secret! Give it to me, slave! Open your hand, coward! I'll show you! You thought you had me fooled, right? Are you finished? I'm here... I'm ready for you to undo me. The last time was wonderful. Now I will let myself be possessed little by little ... And just the touch ... of our bodies ... Will give us such excitement I will then be yours alone. Come here. - Isn't there too much light? - No. It's more beautiful like that. Come here! Here! You know how to do it, don't you? This ... What? You know how it's done? - They're knocking. - Open it! I'm going to open it! Here I come! Tell them to leave us alone. - A letter for you. - Thank you. A letter for me. And so you find peace in heaven, Marquis Zanotti, good benefactor. I bless you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. May the divine mercy welcome the soul of our brother. May the divine mercy forgive you of your sins. In your hands, Lord, I trust my soul Oh, Lord Jesus Christ, receive my soul. Holy Mary, pray for me. Protect me from the enemy. Welcome me at the hour of my death. Saint Joseph, pray for me. St. Joseph, with your Virgin Mary, Your wife, open the arms of divine mercy. Your mother has arrived. Hello Mom. - See here, what are you doing? - Mom, I'm Ilaria. - Ilaria who? - Well, your daughter! Ah, I understand. Mom... And your sister, where is she? I don't see her. Mom, I only have two brothers. Mom... As if I did not know ... Mrs. Marquesa, welcome. Mom, we buried Papa. Surely this funeral never ends... In Dallas, in America, we burn the dead. It takes just a minute, doesn't it? In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. I don't understand why it always has to rain at burials. Oh, it's finally over! I'm hungry! Mom, how come you're back alone? Have you also planted your last husband? - Adriano, don't talk like that! - If you don't mind, Ariano! Very well. If you want to know: Buster, my new husband ... Is a very very good man. And forget that rascal, your father! And why isn't he here with you? He's delayed because ... he has to approve "Lightning". "Lightning" ... to approve a horse. Look... I don't want to apologize to you because you don't deserve it. How could I have done it myself When your bastard of a father left with that bitch? I traveled ... I traveled a lot to forget Ignazio. And at last, one night ... And what a night! I managed to forget him. It was my birthday, and I ended up in Dallas. There was a rodeo, he defended the colors of Bari. And there he was. Mounted on "Lightning". He always fell. But the emigrants were all with him! Poor Buster. I felt tenderness for him. That same night we woke up a priest And got married in Reno, Nevada. You'll like Buster, I'm sure. Oh, it's stopped raining at last. - How do you feel? - Ottavio, you know, I just want to leave. You always feel like doing something. First, to make love. Then, to leave ... Yes, you joke, you joke. Dante! Where are you going? I have to catch a train. Yes, I have done my duty. Didn't you call the police? No lady. I did what you told me. A detective agency. Thank you. You know? That story about the hand could raise a scandal. You're telling me! Lightning! But it's Buster! Buster, my love! Where are you? Hi. Hey! Your husband doesn't look as ugly as you said! When are you going to bury him? What is he talking about? By God, how heavy! It's clear that there's someone inside. No doubt. Come on, Renato, open it! Make a little more haste! A rusty screw. A bad omen My God ... Who could be inside? Mamma mia, but it's Giulio! How they have left him! Buster ... What are you doing, my love? One thing is clear. This isn't an Apache arrow. - Who could it be? - Easy! - Hello! - The detective is here. - He's smart, huh? - Let's hope so. You're the detective, right? My name is Martini. Nobody moves from here until the case is resolved. And I want to solve it before the police arrive, is that clear? What a shitty picture you've taken! It doesn't look like him at all! Look... How vulgar! Hi. Excuse me. - You look the most handsome. - Yes! - Give me a detailed report Of all present. - Yes! - First name. Surnames. Date Of birth. - Yes! - Paternity. Address. Phone. Relatives. - Yes! - Background. - Yes! - What's wrong? Is he stupid? - Yes! - Never mind, forget it. - Yes! - In any case, the severed hand belongs to this one here. - Yes! What severed hand? Can't you see that he has both hands? - Yes! - You, shut your bead And don't be smart! - Yes! - Someone called me about a severed hand. - Yes! - Who was it? - Yes! - Me. - Yes! Get back to your place! Yes! Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. - They stabbed him. - No. - Sheriff ... - Yes! - This is the weapon of crime. - Yes! That, the weapon of crime? Do you know what I do with your crime weapon? Look! Look what I do with your crime weapon! - But where is he going? - Stop! - Fool! - What an idiot! I like you, sheriff. - You have brilliant ideas. - I don't like it. Quiet! What are you doing? Quiet! Did I ask for help? No, hold still! - But what are you doing? - I know very well what I do. I need this to do some research. - Nobody moves from here. - The hand. - Especially the deceased. - Yes. He wasn't nice, your butler, was he? Why? Are you? Whiskers! Yes? Stand up. Get up! Are we sure that those are your hands? Certainly. Positive? And whose do you want them to be? Show them to me! That's absurd! This guy is crazy! Bravo Bravo! It's yours, it's yours, it's yours! Damn disgusting! - He's really crazy! - Silence! - We are in good "hands". - That hand is undoubtedly yours. - Give me the other one? - Bull shit! - Sit down! What are you doing, madman? Look at this! This retard has broken my hand! Bravo. Now, you and I, miss, will have a little chat ... - If you don't mind. - So let's go. Will you show me your little hands? Tell him. Come on! Tell him! Excuse me, sir, just one thing. Excuse me. Excuse me! What is it? I wanted to mention the disappearance of our maid, Rosa. - Might that interest you? - Of course not! You will learn! Very well. He responded! He responded! What is it? I was the one who called you. What should I do? May I leave? Go, go. - Stop there! - what? Where are you going? Where are you going? West Side Story? Didn't I explain?! Nobody moves from here, Is that clear? Until I say so, nobody. Come here, please. Come here! Come on. Who knows what he proposes ... I have a system. Now this here ... Will lead us to the guilty party. Come with me. With your permission. These are my collaborators. Smell. Smell it, come on. Follow the clue! - They're eating it. - Its incredible. - Gross! - They're imbeciles like him! - And what did you expect? I am forced to stick around. So I apologize. Although... If we want to have a good time, I know a few games ...! I always carry cards with me. See? What an idiot ...! Take care, I'm a professional. We noticed. If I had a cloth ... - Do you have a cloth? - Yes, Yes. - Bring it, then. I'm going to teach you. Is it useful? There they are. Do you know how to play "Merchant Fair"? There they are. The Japanese card is placed. Two cards for you, miss. For you, Isabella, two more cards. - You see? What is he talking about? We're trapped. Do you know that this retard has closed all the doors? And to think that tomorrow I had A date with my fiance ... Her and me. Alone. In Linate. Stop talking about that one. Instead, play, okay? I'll take the Japanese. How many do you want? I give it to you. If this Martini goes at this rate, we'll be here for ten months. I'm afraid you're right. Why don't we leave and have a drink in my room? Do you have orange bitters? - I want the Spanish! - I don't like you. Speak like the Apaches. I just want the Spanish! - I'm going to bed. - Very good! Perfect! - See you later, dear. - Bye, my treasure. I'll wait for you upstairs. The horse! I think it's stupid that we have to stay here because of a problem with the servants. I don't understand why that imbecile of a detective won't let us leave. Well, after all it's a very simple case, right? If he has to look for someone, it's Rosa. And if there is a murderer, it can only be her. Hey, do you think I should dress in mourning tonight too? Are you going to answer me or not? Should I dress in mourning again? In my opinion, yes. What's happening?! - Let's go see! - It's upstairs. - Has something happened to Buster? - Donald, stay here. You, keep playing. - Poor fellow... - Look! A big hole. Where were you when it happened? I ... I was there. I was getting dressed. And where was he? He was here. He was taking a shower. Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! - The second one to be murdered in a few hours. - Amazing... Who is the dead man? Do we know him? Mom, it's Ottavio, your brother-in-law! Ottavio? My brother in law? Look at him, poor thing ... It's blood. I want to see too. Where are you going? Silence! Now we will see. I do what I want! Is that clear? Don't mess with me! I'm reenacting the scene! Silence, please! It's burning! It's boiling! And then what did he do? He dried himself! Wow! He's not bad at all! What an imposing physique ...! He would have done more, wouldn't he? The most normal thing in the world! He picked up the hairdryer! Good idea. The hairdryer... The hairdryer. It's just like mine. Help! What happened? Calm down, calm down! In any case, One thing is certain... This dryer doesn't work. What's wrong? Are you still thinking about that woman, your stewardess? Hey, doll. Apart from the sexual satisfaction that I gave you ... The other night ... I have an appointment With my fiancee, understand? I figured! And besides, I'm already tired of you and this crazy family. I'll tell you what's wrong with you. You want to leave because you're a coward! And yet, you see, I must admit ... That despite everything Since you came into my life ... You see, I'm crazy about you! Goodbye. Your presence has disturbed me. I dream of you at night and ... - You're so wild ...! - I know, I know. But that doesn't matter. And pardon, but I think that you're moving very fast and besides ... You're a bit of a tramp. "Ten will be United to our name, " "One will only remain, No one knows how. " "And of those nine dead gathered in the cemetery, " "The treasure will find light And you will discover the mystery." "All will happen on that cursed night, " "in which the ancient oak Will be struck down by lightning ... " Well, I must go. Yes, yes. I'm leaving. Maybe this way ... No, it's better there. Well, goodbye. That idiot has locked up here too! Where's the dwarf? Mr. Martini, open up! It's incredible! Mr. Martini! Open up! Do you remember the maid? She was there. This one, when I need him, is not. Now we put down Donald The masturbator, And to sleep. "EXCITATION" Not tonight. I don't want the discharge. - Come on. - I'd rather have a kiss. Oh very well. I can give you a little kiss. - Here it is. - No, not your kiss, I want it from him! If that imbecile doesn't kiss me, I won't sleep - Come on, Martini. - Come on. - What? - Do me a favor? Make a little effort. A little kiss, a little kiss! A kiss. But ... I don't understand why ... Because ... because then we can rest easy. Good night, Donald. He used his tongue! Come on, Donald. Now go to sleep. At once! Come here, Marlowe. How tedious! I understand ... All women say the same when they are with me. And to think that I, when I'm With you ... I had a blast! It's true. Hey, I ... Can I have a look? Have I ever told you that I'm a cuckold? Excuse me, but, what do you mean? Between women and me, there is a kind of incompatibility of character. I don't know why, but they all deceive me. But what are you doing. What am I doing? I'm undressing, can't you see? - Yes, but I don't understand why. - I'll explain why ... I'm closing the trap. Listen, do you know the last time they hit me? I was cheated during ... How "during"? Yes. She started making love with me, and then ended up with another. Really? With another? - Come on, hold still. - Leave me alone. - Don't do that. I know you'll decieve me later too, doll! My love. Burned. - What happened? - In Donald's room. - I'm scared! - I heard a noise. - Sorry, something awful! - We heard a frightening noise. They killed him before my eyes. I don't know what he's done. I was here, He was there, and then suddenly everything was burnt and black ... Oh, little Buster, how scary! There is a hyena that is taking good advantage. Look how they left him. Poor Donald. The fourth dead in 24 hours. An enviable average, isn't it? At least he will have figured out why he does it. Is it possible that there is no motive? - And what were you doing here? - I'd like to know that, too. Let's give him time. Surely you have a plan B. - He connected it to the high voltage. - Right, Sheriff? Would you show me your hands? Me? It seems obvious ... The killer, to be able to connect the plug to the high voltage, must have burned his hands. And our friend ... has a burnt hand. I knew he would attack again ... But this time... He's fallen, I'm sorry. - I burned it with the candle. - Yes, Yes. No, no, listen to me, you're making a mistake, he couldn't do that! - It can't be him! - Oh my God! Quiet everyone! - Sheriff? - Yes? Look here. And? Why did the murderer need to get on the table to be able to Connect the antimasturbator device? How? Well, ask him, okay? No. You better ask him. Me!? Its not my business. - Ariano! - My son is a murderer! - Him!? Yes, I knew it! - I haven't done anything! - He's the killer! - It's not true! - And he killed my husband too! - Is that true? - No! - Yes! - No! I have nothing to do with it! - Murderer! - Watch out, he's getting away! Open up! Open up! I'll get you, even if you hide in hell! Come here. Explain why he ran away. Haven't you heard that he is the killer? Who? The one who has escaped. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There's "Lightning." Let's see if I can get on him ... Calm. Wait ... Let me climb on, let's go. Wait. Be still. He's running to the field! We'll never open this door. Hey! What about "Lightning"? "Lightning"! Oh, the horse. "Lightning"! Get Ready! What is he doing? Don't move! Are you crazy? No, "Lightning"! Too many have died! What an impact! - He made it, eh? - Bravo. - He's two miles from here! - Are you sure? Prepare a rope in a tree! I'll bring him back by nightfall! - Damned murderer! - OK, we'll see you! Come on, Lightning! - How brave. - Indeed. - I'm calmer now. - Eh? Now that we know who the killer is, We only need capture him ... - and then I can leave. - It's opening! But what are doing here in your underpants? And you ask me? What was I doing in the room Of a lady like that, in underpants? Questioning her, right? - I did it! I opened the door. - Bravo! Let's go. You know, Martini? I'm starting to like you. - I thought you were stupid. - Thank you. Hey, Martino, I have an idea. What about ...? I don't know... Get us a bellyful of spaghetti? No way! What about spaghetti ?! Better a little intimate orgy. You... Set the menu ... You. And I do ... the women. I do ... the women. Good idea! - Wear a tuxedo, eh? - Yes! A tuxedo. What's he doing ?! Where are you? Damned little child prodigy! When I catch you, I'll kill you! Come out, if you have guts! Face me! You little wretch! Giddee-up, "Lightning"! It's not possible! You did it! - Hey! - Me? - Yes. Are you ready? - Almost there. - Come on. I like him. Who knows why my brother did it? Do you know that he was an angel when he was small? In my opinion, Rosa was waiting for him somewhere. I am convinced that those two were lovers. - Yes, but ... who? - Rosa, the maid! - Ariano? With the dwarf? - How long have you been working on this? I started as a child, with my mother. - Hey, do you understand What this is all about? - Yes. But I want to solve the case without the help of anyone. Did I tell you I'm a cuckold? Believe me ... There is no woman who has not been with me who has not deceived me and then left. Excuse me, but don't do that ... - I won't be long, you know? - Oh, no! Give me a hand. - Come on. - Please! If you approach, you will see, it will only be a moment... You just have to come close, I'll come to you, you to me ... Hurry up, that's where you have things to do, don't look at it ... - Come on. - No. But ... what's wrong with Dante? Don't get like that. I haven't even touched her yet. He told me about his unpleasant situation. I told her about my disgraceful love situation. - Don't be like that! - Calm down! We agreed to have an orgy, didn't we? Then let's stick to the agreement! What are you doing? Are you running? What's wrong? He looks crazy. - Has he gone mad? - Yes, it's still in there! I can't understand what's happened to him Don't hesitate, explain! Do you want to explain yourself? It's better if you don't make him jealous, you know. - Do you feel ill? - No. What's he doing? - Oh, my God! - Is he jealous? - What's wrong? - He's become ill ... Did he get dizzy? Come on, get some ice from the refrigerator. Hurry up! That's it. Come on, we gotta get her up. And this is four and a half already. And to think we were convinced that we had found the culprit ... I'm not saying it's normal, but ... Aren't all these dead uncomfortable? Of course! I never tire of saying that I don't do anything here. If you're here, it's because you have a reason, don't you think? - To sell a book. A good business. - What book? If you want, I'll show it to you. Maybe I can interest you. We are losing time because of that idiot. You're in love, eh? And to think that if it had not been for The refrigerator, you would now be mine ... Hurry up! Look here. Here are all the noble families in this area ... And you don't want to see it ... Why would we want to see it? Because it's about them. The Zanotti's. what are you going to say about us? Let me have a look. - It's in alphabetical order. It should be here. - Where? - Here. - Where is it? - Yes where? - Say! Someone has ripped out the pages. It's missing the chapter that talked about you. It's recent, I'm sure. - If you don't mind, I'd like Investigate this, I'd like ... - Eh? If you don't mind, I'd like to do the investigation myself. - Really?! Who could have ripped the pages out? - I don't know. - Was this the only one? - No, I had another. But I lost it when I had that famous accident with the car. - You remember? - How can I not remember? - The lights are out. - Then pay the bills, guys! I'd better not use this. My lipstick. My name?! And what's this? "Ten will be United to our name, " "One will only remain, No one knows how. " "And of those nine dead ..." - Ilaria! Ilaria! - What is it? - Ilaria! - What is it? Open up, please! It's important! No, I can't, Letizia. Let me sleep. Listen, I found some folded pages ripped from a book! I think I've figure out Why they've all been murdered. There's a treasure ... It seems that the old legend of the Zanetti's is true. Ilaria! I'm scared! I'm scared! Won't they kill me now too ?! Take this ... She's been murdered, too. She had found out something in the pages of a book. Maybe my book? Yes! In fact, everything started when you brought that stupid book to the castle. Okay, you've already insisted too much! Listen, I've decided! - I'll call the police, are you happy? - Are you going to call them? You should have done it a while ago, Martini! - Call them. - What's the number? - 90824. - What? 9 - 0 - 8 - 2 - 4. Anyway, they won't know who I am. - Hello! - Hello... - Listen, I ... - This is the answering machine for the local police, We are absent for a moment. You have 45 seconds to report ... Homicides, theft, robbery, Frauds. Thank you for calling. - Speak at the end of the music. - Hey ?! Listen! You see, We are in a big mess You see ... many have already died, and they may do more. You'd better get involved. - Call this number ... - 90812. - Repeat it! - 9 - 0 - 8 - 1 - 2. - The Marquis Zanotti? - Yes? - A package for him. - Where should we leave it? - Upstairs. - Well? Isn't Buster back yet? - No. - As soon as he gets back, I'm leaving. - I'm leaving right now. Nothing and no one keeps me here. Otherwise, if he wants to kill, you're there. Mom, you can't leave right now. At this point any of us could be the killer. And besides, ma'am, since the police are coming, the only one who can ... leave is me, don't you think? A pity, because the three of us have already found something ... - We'll leave, then. - Yes. Oh, yes! Darling, will you do me favor ...? - I'll accompany you to the door. - The tip! I lost everything at the "Merchant Fair". I'm sorry. Well ... take this. - Well, I needed one of these. - Then lend it to me, eh? Well, I'm off too. Anyway, it's your business. Good luck! Calm! Calm down, collaborators! Calm! What are you doing? - Quiet! - What do they do? What a shame! Calm down! This is crazy! Outside! - What's inside? - Let's open it, shall we? What's happening? But ... weren't you going to leave? Why those faces? What happened? How awful! - The child prodigy. - What? It's Ariano? Oh, my son! How strange that you're in that box! I knew he would commit suicide. Killers almost always do. They always come back to the scene of the crime. Don't cry, be strong. Of course, in any case, now the culprit is in our hands. Yeah, right! Because first he committed suicide, and then got into the box. Then he wrapped himself, wrote the address, and then ... Went to the post office, paid the postage and sent himself. Do you know that you're a real idiot? I like you. You have guts. He's breathing! Still breathing! It's true, Mom. They're right. - Maybe we can save him. - How? - You'll see. Breathing. No? I'm going to do artificial respiration right now. Mouth to mouth. You're not going to kiss anyone! Understand? Let him do the Mouth-to-mouth respiration! Come on, do it! You, you have plenty of air, do it! You're not going to kiss anyone! You hear? To nobody! Cowards! You're all cowards! - I'll do it for my son. - It's right that the mother. Hurry up and revive him, then I have to deal with him. Come on, Mom. It might harm her, right? Ma'am! It might hurt you, you know. Ma'am! Are you sleeping? - Martini? - Oh, yes! I'll take care of it. Get up, ma'am, what are you doing? Up! She's dead! Look at her eyes. - The eyes have it! - She's dead? Mom is dead! What is that tube? Well? Cyanide! - Poor lady. - I told you he was the killer. I wasn't able to find that son of a bitch child prodigy! Ah, he's here. Good. And what is my wife doing under the table? Tell me, What are you doing, the fool? Poor mom ... - You let her be murdered. - Me? It was he who didn't want to do mouth-to-mouth breathing! I would have done it, But he didn't want to do it! I would have done it, but it was him! It was him! Don't deny it! - There you have it. A coward. - Courage. - There he is! See him? - I can see that... Courage ... You're going to need it! It's up to him. He's a monster! A beast! An empty chamber? It's up to you. Ready. Get ready! Tied? It's up to you. How will we beat him? He's a genius, look at him. You're both tough, eh? - Well ... Don't exaggerate. - Take it. Ready. How did you do it? I already told you that there was nothing to see there. - What's there? Let me have a look. - Are you drunk already? He's already drunk. You're a dunce! It's my turn. Shooting. - Nothing... - Damn ... you and your challenges ... It's your turn. Shoot. Come on, take the gun. and shoot again! Shoot! Dishonest and miserable! Shoot! Now I'll teach you! Now ... you have to be brave. Only one possibility. One empty chamber. One.. Two... With this its three. Four... And five. Shoot? Oh, yeah! He's one of a kind! Extraordinary! The best, the only! Shoot? Yes! Come on, shoot again, madman! I told you that he would win ... How many times do I have to tell you that the one who lives is the winner? Oh, no ... Poor Buster! Hey, watch out! - I'll hold him. - Yes, Yes. I'll hold him, wretch! Go away! Come on. He's still stiff, eh? How many will there be now? What does it matter? One more or less ... Anyway, we're going to die. All of us. - I think there are seven. - Seven! But if there were six yesterday. Seven... I think there are seven. Then I will count again. - There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ... - You already counted that. (??) - Huh? - You already counted that one. Que a ese ya lo ha contado. Shut up, you're going to drive me crazy! Calm down a little bit, okay ?! There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and a 9! It's nine And there's nothing more to talk about, okay? - Nine? - Yes! I counted also. (??) Me ha contado a m? tambi?n. He's right, there are nine of them. The book also says so. Where did you find it? It was in the car, on the slope. See here! ... Do you think this is the right time to start reading a book? Hold on. Listen to this. "Ten will be United to our name, " "One will only remain, No one knows how. " "And of those nine dead gathered in the cemetery ... " Do you see how there are nine? - Nine... - Go ahead, continue! "And of those nine dead Gathered in the cemetery, " "The treasure will find light" "And the mystery shall be revealed." "All will happen on that cursed night, " "In which the ancient oak Will be struck down by lightning. " - Hello? - Are you the one who called the police station? Ah, the police, thank goodness! Hurry up, because there is no one that understands this mess! And how can we? you're isolated and the river has overflowed. How? Did you hear? We're isolated and the river has overflowed. However, it is possible that we can get there, okay? Yes, but hurry up, because ... I have lost count of the dead. - Have confidence. - Yes, I'll be waiting for you. - Who was it? - The police. They said they couldn't come because the river has overflowed. We are incommunicado. Disgusting dog! Go, go. And what now? "And of those nine dead gathered in the cemetery, " "The treasure will find light And you will discover the mystery. " - What treasure? - Well ... no idea. Apart from the castle, we only have debts. My father mortgaged everything. - But now that I think ...! - Say it, say it. There was an old family legend, A bit of gossip they told me when I was little. - Then no one ever spoke of it again. - What if there really was a treasure? And if that's why ... they've all been killed? And why not us? Because ... The prophecy has already been fulfilled. Listen. "Ten will be United to our name, " "One will only remain." - One? "None knows how." Do you understand? It's you. The only one left. The only one connected somehow to them. And the others? Who killed them? Her! "And of those nine dead Gathered in the cemetery ... " - What does "gathered" mean? - Buried, right? "The treasure will find light And you will discover the mystery. " - Who could that have been? - There's no one upstairs. Only the dead. It's stopped raining. I'm leaving ... Well, goodbye. Someone should go up and take a look. - You go first. - And why not you? Well, you're the detective, right? - You aren't afraid of ghosts, are you? - Yes, why? I'll go up if you do too, Martini. Then you won't go up because I'm not going to do it. Courage, let's all go. Come on. I already told you that it's stopped raining And why don't we escape? Run away, let's go. When was this candlestick lit? It came from there. The light is gone. Didn't you pay the bill? - Oh, luckily it's back! - They paid it. - Thank goodness. Where did the noises come from? From here, surely. The living room is just below. - You're right. Come on, let's split up. - I'll go with her. - No, go there. - Then with you. I'm going to look in Ariano's room. Hurry up, Martini, come on! I'm going with her. And me? - Martini! What are you doing here? - And what about you?! Scaring me? Didn't you find anything? What do you want, to move me from here ?! I'm scared! - And Dante, where is he? - What do I care about Dante! 1049. 01:27:25,068 --> 01:27:26,857 - And Hilde? - I don't know! - How should I know? - Come on, come with me. - Wait for me! Where are you going? Wait for me, Miss ... Miss ... Wait ... Stop scaring me, or I'll punch you ...! - Come on, through that door. - Why? There, a door? - Where are you? - Here. Where are we going? Be careful not to slip. - It's useless to look for them. They've disappeared. - Look! Nine crosses. If I keep on running, I'll have a heart attack. Someone is ahead of us. Eh? How? Don't you see? The crosses. Yes, the crosses. They've put up the crosses ... but they left the dead back there. Someone is fulfilling exactly What the prophecy says. Listen ... "And of those nine dead Gathered in the cemetery ... " - Understand? - Don't get your hopes up. - Wait a minute. - It's over, I'm leaving. O I G L I B R D A A D R D - Move that cross. - Yes. Go, go! - This one? - Yes, that one over there, the first one. Remove it! - And how do I move it? I won't be able to move it. - Take the cross, let's go, come on! - They're barely buried. Why? - I already told you! Put it at the end! Where the last one is! - It's heavy, very! - You have to do it! - Where? - There at the end. - Here? - And now take the "A", and put it there. - This one? - Yes. But quickly! Courage! Courage, you can do it! Yes, of course I can. Then you'll explain What you're planning. There, where the "B" is. - Yes. - In the center? - There, there! - Where is it? - In front of you, there. - This one? - Yes. - Shall I take it out? - Yes. And put the "B" there, at the beginning. Where the "O" was. That's good, right? There it is. Like that. Come here. - Come on! - Come here, go there, Remove that, the other there ... It's already good, right? Look! - Look! - At what? Now everything makes sense. There is the key. "Billiardo" (Billiards). Don't you see? The initials of the names of the dead form the word "billiardo" (billiards) ... - That is the answer to where the treasure is. - No! There really is a treasure! The legend was true! Billiardo. (Billiards.) Do you understand? As a matter of fact, there is an old billiard table in the attic. Let's go, hurry, come with me! Martini? Ilaria? Hilde? H - E - L - P! Don't put them on. It doesn't matter. What's wrong? I won't say anything ... Not now ... I swear. What...? What...? What is it? Please, where are we going? Hey, jewelery! Hey, Miss ... Oh, my God! - Someone was here earlier. - But who? - He left nothing. - Of what? - Of the treasure! Right? Hey, what are you doing? - But... - Do you have a bullet? - Oh, it's you. - Yes. - Where have you been? - With the killer. - What?! Yes ... And the, the, the ... And the dead, eh? Actually ... This one is alive. - What is he saying? - You'll see ... - How? The murderer, I've seen him! I recognized him! And then to me ... He got away from me. Martini! Stop, Grandpa! Dad! Stop or I'll loose the dogs! Worse for you! You asked for it! - Attack! - Yes, attack! 1144. 01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,900 Attack! No! What are you doing? Do you obey him? Come on, come on! Here! This is your cabin, Mr. Marquis! Good. Well, well. Very good. I hope to have a good trip. Give it to me. - No no no. It's... It's a family keepsake. I'll take it. Very good. Then I'll wake you up at the border. - Have a good trip! - Thank you. Lovely, lovely, lovely! You see? We did it. I told you they were right. The prophecy has been fulfilled. There was... A real treasure. But we have not ... managed to defeat the prophecy. Why not? They spoke of nine dead, and yet ... There are eight. No ... There are nine. Why?
