BY THE BEGINNING OF THE '70S, MAN HAD BROUGHT THE DESTRUCTION OF HIS ENVIRONMENT CLOSE TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN. OF COURSE, THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF RHETORIC ABOUT SAVING THE EARTH, BUT IN REALITY, VERY LITTLE WAS DONE. AND THEN ONE DAY, THE POLLUTED EARTH COULD TAKE NO MORE. - YEAH? - HELLO, JOHN? LOOK, I'VE JUST HAD A CALL, WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF LONDON. THINGS ARE MOVING VERY FAST. THEY'LL BE CLOSING THE CITIES TODAY. I'LL BE THERE IN HALF AN HOUR. -WE'LL BE READY. -OKAY. WHAT'S HAPPENED, JOHN? WE HAVE TO LEAVE RIGHT AWAY. THEY'RE CLOSING UP THE CITIES TODAY. ROGER WILL BE HERE IN HALF AN HOUR. I HEARD THE PHONE RINGING, MOMMY, IS IT ABOUT... YES, DARLING. ROGER WILL BE HERE SHORTLY, PLEASE HURRY. WHAT ABOUT DAVID? I TELEPHONED THE SCHOOL YESTERDAY AND SAID WE'D BE THERE ON SHORT NOTICE. MOMMY. PLEASE HURRY. GET DRESSED. OKAY. OH, JOHN. A YEAR AGO I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT COULD HAPPEN TO US. THE FAMINE IN CHINA, INDIA, AND MOST OF SOUTHEAST ASIA IS UNDOUBTEDLY A MAJOR HISTORICAL CATASTROPHE. THE EPIDEMIC OF GRASS DISEASE HAS SPREAD TO AFRICA AND PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA. ALL TYPES OF GRAMINEAE, THE BOTANICAL TERM FOR THE GRASS FAMILY, WHEAT, RYE, RICE, BARLEY, ET CETERA, ARE AFFECTED. HELLO, ROGER, OLD CHUM, SIT DOWN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS END OF TOWN? WELL, I'M IN CHARGE OF A COUPLE OF PROJECTS NOW, AT THE LABORATORY JUST AROUND THE CORNER. THIS IS MY BROTHER, DAVID. -HOW DO YOU DO? -ROGER BURNHAM. -HIS FATHER WAS MY CO IN KOREA. -OH, WAS HE? HE COMES OVER TO THE HOUSE REGULARLY TO SEE MARY AND TAKE SOME MONEY OFF ME. EMERGENCY COMMITTEE OF WORLD ECOLOGY HAS COME TO THE UNANIMOUS CONCLUSION THAT CUMULATIVE RESIDUES OF POLLUTANTS AND PESTICIDES IN BOTH THE SOIL AND THE ATMOSPHERE ARE THE CAUSE OF THE GRASS DISEASE. BECAUSE OF ITS INFECTIOUS NATURE, BIOCHEMISTS FEEL THAT IT IS CARRIED BY A VIRUS. SO FAR, NO CURE HAS BEEN FOUND. HOWEVER, IF SUCH AREAS ARE CAREFULLY DESTROYED BY FIRE, THE VIRUS IS EASILY CONTAINED, ACCORDING TO SIR CHARLES BRENNER... CRAP. BRENNER TOLD ME IT'S SPREADING EVERYWHERE. THE FOLLOWING MAPS SHOW THE EXTENTS OF THE AREAS OF INFECTION. THERE ARE RUMORS AT THE LAB THAT THE HOME SECRETARY HAS ALREADY DRAWN UP A FEW LITTLE PLANS, LIKE FOOD RATIONING AND RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL, AND JUST IN CASE, MARTIAL LAW. HMM, THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY PROMISING. DAVID'S JUST TOLD ME THAT HE'S TURNING MOST OF HIS ACREAGE OVER TO TUBEROUS CROPS. YOU KNOW, POTATOES, BEATS. YES, AND I'M THINKING OF KILLING OFF ALL THE ANIMALS AND HAVING THEM TINNED. YOU FARMERS. YOU'RE BLOODY PESSIMISTS. HE'S BLOODY SMART. STARVATION DEATHS IN THE AFFECTED COUNTRIES ARE NOW ESTIMATED AT UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION. AND IT'LL BE WORSE HERE THAN IT IS IN AFRICA OR ASIA WHERE THEY'RE USED TO FAMINE. JOHN, I WANT YOU TO BRING THE FAMILY UP TO THE FARM IF AND WHEN... LOOK, I'LL KNOW A BIT AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC AT THE LAB. YOU KNOW, IF THE REGULATIONS ARE GOING TO BE PUT INTO EFFECT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW, JOHN. RIGHT, AND IF YOU DO THAT, I'LL MAKE ROOM FOR YOU, TOO. THAT'S VERY KIND. OH, THAT'S VERY SMART. IF THINGS GET REALLY BAD, WE'LL NEED SOMEONE ALONG WHO WE CAN PUT IN THE BELT. GEORGE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK CAUSED THE VIRUS? IT'S 'CAUSE THEM CHINESE FERTILIZE EVERYTHING WITH HUMAN SHIT. GEORGE, HEAR WHAT I SAID? YES, I DID, AND IF IT'S TRUE, I COULD SELL YOU TO THEM CHINKS FOR A BLOOMING FORTUNE. GOING AWAY ON A LITTLE TRIP, SIR? YES, THAT'S RIGHT, CONSTABLE, JUST OFF FOR A FEW DAYS IN THE LAKE DISTRICT. I'D STEER CLEAR OF NOTTING HILL AND EAST FINCHLEY IF I WERE YOU, SIR. WE'VE HEARD THERE'S SOME TROUBLE THERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU, CONSTABLE. ON NOW YOU GO, SIR. ATTENTION: ALL POLICE PERSONNEL ARE REQUESTED TO KEEP THEIR WEAPONS LOADED AS FROM NOW. THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY OFFICIAL FIGURES ON STARVATION DEATHS WORLDWIDE, BUT AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES NOW PLACE THE NUMBER AT OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION. EVERYWHERE IN INDIA, PITCHED BATTLES HAVE BEEN REPORTED BETWEEN ARMY TROOPS AND THE RIOTING POPULOUS. THE NEWS THAT STARVING CHINESE HAVE ENGULFED HONG KONG HAS BEEN VERIFIED. LOCALLY, THE POLLUTION CLOUD IS LIFTING, BUT THE MINISTRY EMPHASIZES THAT PHYSICAL EXERTION SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN THE LONDON AREA. OH, TO HELL WITH IT, LET'S GO AND HAVE DINNER. OH, I'M SORRY. THE BUTCHER HAD NOTHING BUT GOAT AND HORSE MEAT. I TOOK THE GOAT. OH, THAT REMINDS ME, MY CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN CAN GET US TIN BEEF, HE SAID, OF A SLIGHT PREMIUM. I SAID, "SPLENDID, 50 TO 100 POUNDS." WHAT DO YOU THINK, DARLING? IT MIGHT SOUND SILLY, BUT... WELL, I'D FIGURE I WAS CHEATING ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE QUEUES. I'D RATHER TAKE MY CHANCES LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I'VE MADE UP MY MIND, DARLING. WHAT ABOUT? MY VIRGINITY. I'VE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT IT ANYMORE. YOU'LL HAVE TO. GOOD GOD, 16. ...AND A HALF. PLEASE, DARLING, ON THE FARM, THERE WON'T BE MUCH TO DO. YOUR FATHER WOULD SHOOT ME. DADDY WOULDN'T, BUT MOMMY MIGHT. SHE THINKS I'M STILL A CHILD. YOU ARE, YOU KNOW. WELL THEN. MAKE ME A WOMAN. PLEASE, NO! HELP! HELP US! SOMEBODY HELP! PLEASE HELP! HELP! IN LEEDS, FOLLOWING THE CRISIS DUE TO SEWAGE SEEPING INTO THE CITY WATER SUPPLY, AN OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA HAS BEEN REPORTED. THE SITUATION WORLDWIDE IN REGARD TO THE FAMINE IS SERIOUS INDEED. IN THE COUNTRIES WHICH NO LONGER HAVE ANY ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT, THERE ARE REPORTS OF WIDESPREAD CANNIBALISM. THE HOME SECRETARY HAS JUST ISSUED THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT: THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY DENIES ALLEGATIONS BY SIR JOHN CLOUTON OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE IS SCARCELY A WEEK'S SUPPLY OF FOOD IN THE COUNTRY, AND EMPHASIZES THAT STOCKS ARE SUFFICIENT. SUFFICIENT FOR EVERYBODY TO STARVE. IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW THAT DANGER COULD ONLY COME FROM PANIC IN THE POPULATION AT LARGE. ACCORDINGLY, VARIOUS TEMPORARY REGULATIONS ARE BEING PUT INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. DAMN IT, THEY'VE JUMPED THE GUN. ALL CITIES OF OVER 300,000 POPULATION ARE SEALED. MILITARY BARRICADES ARE PRESENTLY BEING ERECTED. -JESUS... -...CHRIST! I'M FRIGHTFULLY SORRY ABOUT THAT. GETTING DANGEROUS TO BREATHE NOWADAYS. THIS GRAPH SHOWS THE DECLINE IN GRAIN SURFACES IN THE UNITED STATES. BETTER TIGHTEN THE OLD BELT SOME MORE. ...HAS UNANIMOUSLY CONDEMNED AS BARBAROUS THE NERVE GAS BOMBINGS BY THE CHINESE AIR FORCE OF MAJOR POPULATION AREAS. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT JUSTIFIED THIS HORRENDOUS ACTION AS NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL. FOR COMMENTS, WE HAVE THE EMINENT ECOLOGIST SIR CHARLES BRENNER IN THE STUDIO. SIR CHARLES, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THE CHINESE SLAUGHTER OF 300 MILLION OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE? WELL, YOU KNOW, IT APPEARS RATHER BARBARIC ON THE SURFACE, BUT LOGICALLY, THEY WERE ACTING TO ENSURE THE CONTINUANCE OF THE CHINESE NATION. BUT FROM A... MAY WE ASSUME THEN, SIR CHARLES, THAT IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF A SIMILAR FAMINE HERE THAT YOU WOULD CALL SUCH AN ACTION BY OUR GOVERNMENT EQUALLY LOGICAL? IT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT WE SHOULD BE... YES, LET US ACCEPT IT IS UNLIKELY, SIR CHARLES, BUT IF, IF THE UNLIKELY BECAME REALITY, WOULD YOU... I WILL NOT HAVE YOU PUT WORDS INTO MY MOUTH. I'M MERELY ASKING... YOU'RE TRYING TO FORCE ME INTO A DECLARATION REGARDING A... WE MUST APOLOGIZE FOR THE BREAK IN TRANSMISSION. NORMAL SERVICES WILL BE RESUMED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BLOODY MUSIC. I HOPE WE WON'T HAVE TO DESTROY ALL OUR CROCUSES JUST BECAUSE... OH, LORD. THERE'S A PATCH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM. YEAH, THAT'S IT. OH, HELL. I MIGHT AS WELL BURN THE ENTIRE LAWN. OH, NO, JOHN, CAN'T YOU JUST BURN AROUND IT? NO, ONCE IT STARTS LIKE THAT... I'LL ASK THE GARDENER WHAT ELSE I CAN PUT IN. RIGHT. JOHN. WHY CAN'T WE GO TO MANITOBA? JUST FOR A FEW WEEKS, UNTIL WE SEE HOW THIS AWFUL VIRUS THING IS GOING OVER HERE. MOTHER AND FATHER HAVEN'T SEEN THE CHILDREN IN TWO YEARS. DAVID WAS HARDLY SEVEN. AND IF IT GETS ANY WORSE, CANADA IS MUCH SAFER. BUT I CAN'T GO UNTIL MY BUILDING'S FINISHED. THIS IS THE BIG ONE. AN ARCHITECT DOESN'T JUST WALK OFF. BUT IT'S ALMOST FINISHED, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT... IT ISN'T FINISHED UNTIL IT IS FINISHED. I JUST CAN'T, DARLING. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH THE CHILDREN? NO, I CAN'T GO WITHOUT YOU. WELL. WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT, LOVE. I HOPE SO. I'M GETTING FRIGHTENED NOW. COME ON, LET'S GET THE FOOD! COME ON! GET THE FOOD! BE CAREFUL, JOHN. COME ON, DROP IT OVER. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! THE BLOODY COPS ARE COMING. GET BEHIND THE LINE! DEAR GOD, THEY'VE GOT TEAR GAS. TEAR GAS, RUN! MY EYES! GO ON, STOP HIM! LET'S GET ON HIM! LET'S ROLL HIM. COME ON, ROCK HIM OVER! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! RUN, RUN, COME ON! THERE'S A GUNMAN ON THE ROOF. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IN THE SHOP. I CAN'T GET THE ONE IN THE SHOP. I'LL FACE THE ONE ON THE ROOF. COME ON, LET'S GO. LOOK, ROGER. WE CAN REJOIN THE A1 HERE AT HUNTINGTON. WE MIGHT GET AROUND A BACK ROAD HERE IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY. POINT NUMBER TWO: WE NEED SOME FIREARMS. GUNS? WHO IS THAT? MR. STURDEVANT, IT'S JOHN CUSTANCE. WHO? WHO'S THAT? IT'S JOHN CUSTANCE. MR. CUSTANCE? WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I-I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BUT, UM, I'M JUST GOING ON HOLIDAYS TO THE LAKE DISTRICT, AND I NEED SOME AMMO FOR MY .22. OH, WELL, I'M NOT OPEN AT THIS HOUR, BUT COME IN. MR. STURDEVANT, MR. BURNHAM. -HOW DO YOU DO? -DOOR TO THE LEFT. YOU SHOULD HAVE COME AT A REASONABLE HOUR, YOU KNOW. YOU WANT A STANDARD LOAD? OH, THAT'LL BE FINE. DO YOU WANT ONE BOX OR TWO? MY STOCKS ARE GETTING PRETTY LOW, YOU KNOW. WE BETTER TAKE TWO. AND I THINK WE'LL BUY A COUPLE OF SPORTING RIFLES. AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE PISTOLS YOU HAVE. YES, YOU HAVE YOUR PERMIT, OF COURSE? WELL, ACTUALLY, NO, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME, BUT I THOUGHT AFTER ALL YOU DO. NO, NOT WITHOUT A PERMIT, MR. CUSTANCE. OH, THAT'S A PITY. WELL, IN THAT CASE... I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THEM. YOU'RE BREAKING THE LAW! BE QUIET! I'M VERY SORRY, MR. STURDEVANT. WE'LL PAY YOU, OF COURSE, AND WE'LL TIE YOU UP SO YOU WON'T BE BREAKING THE LAW. I'VE GOT A GUN ON YOU. -DON'T MOVE. -THAT'S IT, PIRRIE. GET YOUR HANDS UP, AND MOVE INTO THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. I'VE TOLD YOU, MRS. PIRRIE, NOT TO COME INTO THE SHOP. WHAT'S WRONG, ANDY? LOOK, I'LL BE TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU, MR. STURDEVANT. THE SITUATION HERE IS APPROACHING ANARCHY. THERE ARE RIOTS IN LONDON ALREADY, AND SHOOTING. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA DIE OF STARVATION. MR. BURNHAM HERE IS ON THE INSIDE. I'M A GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST WORKING ON THE VIRUS. THERE'S NO SOLUTION IN SIGHT. I FAIL TO SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR ACTIONS HERE. THERE'S A RUMOR IN GOVERNMENT CIRCLES, AND THE RUMOR MAY WELL BE TRUE, THAT THE BIG CITIES WILL BE NERVE GASSED AS THEY WERE IN CHINA. NOW, WE'RE GOING TO MY BROTHER'S FARM IN THE NORTH WHERE THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD. IF YOU GIVE US GUNS, WE'LL TAKE YOU ALONG. I'M SORRY, MR. CUSTANCE, BUT I'VE GOT COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR GOVERNMENT. KEEP THEM COVERED, PIRRIE. WAIT A MINUTE, MR. STURDEVANT. WHAT IF IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAID? -WHAT IF HE... -IT'S NONSENSE! YOU JUST MIND YOUR JOB, MY LAD. I'M NOT ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION. AH! ME AND MY BIRD, MY MISSUS, WE'LL TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER. IT'LL JUST TAKE US A MINUTE TO PACK. I'M VERY USEFUL WITH WEAPONS AND CARS AND THINGS, MR. CUSTANCE. YOU'LL NEED A BLOKE LIKE ME THE WAY THINGS ARE. ROPE, ROPE. WHEN THE DECK IS SECURE, PUT UP THE REST OF THE BARBED WIRE. RIGHT, SIR. WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS THIS CONTRAPTION DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD? I LIVE IN SHEFFIELD, I WANT TO GET HOME! IT'S BEEN ON THE RADIO, SIR. THEY'RE MAKING SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU. UNTIL THEN, ALL ROADS TO THE CITY ARE CLOSED. WELL, GET THE BLOODY THINGS OPEN AGAIN! WELL, GET THIS ONE OPEN ANYWAY, I WANT TO GET HOME TO MY OLD LADY. YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID, SIR, GET GOING. GET THE BLOODY THINGS OPEN, YOU STUPID BASTARDS! CORPORAL. WE HAVE ORDERS TO SHOOT ANYONE WHO GIVES US TROUBLE. IF YOU DON'T GO WITHIN TEN SECONDS, WE'LL LET YOU HAVE IT AND YOU CAN BE CARRIED BACK. CORPORAL. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN. OOH, GOD! ROGER! COME ON, ROGER, GET A MOVE ON. SHIFT THAT BARRICADE, GO ON. THESE STERLING GUNS ARE GOOD, WE CAN USE THESE. NO MILITARY WEAPONS, WE DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT WITH THEM, THROW THEM IN THE DITCH. THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY, WAS THERE, DARLING? NO. WHY DID YOU DO ALL THE SHOOTING? I HAD TO. IT COULDN'T WAIT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND YOURSELF HANGING BY THE SHORT AND CURLY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE. TIE THEM UP. WELL, THAT WAS THE PLAN, BUT... I SHOULD BE MOST RELIEVED IF I COULD SEND ALL THE BOY'S HOME AND CLOSE THE SCHOOL FOR THE TIME BEING. YES, I THINK YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT TO GET OUT OF LONDON WHILE YOU COULD. THE NEWS IS VERY UNSETTLING. -ALL THIS VIOLENCE. -YES, YES, I KNOW. WELL...GOODBYE, MRS. CUSTANCE. GOODBYE, SIR. AND...DAVID, KEEP UP WITH YOUR LATIN. IT'LL STAND WHEN GOOD'S DEAD. CASSOP'S GOT THE WIND UP. WELL, SO SHOULD I IF I HAD A MOB LIKE YOU TO CONTEND WITH. -HELLO, SPOOKS, -HELLO, SPOOKS. -HELLO, SPOOKS. -GOOD MORNING, SIR. MRS. CUSTANCE. I'VE, UH, GOT A LITTLE GIFT FOR DAVEY. OH, THAT'S JOLLY NICE OF YOU, SPOOKS. I TOLD SPOOKS THAT HE COULD HAVE ANYTHING I LEFT IN OUR ROOM, -IS THAT OKAY? -OF COURSE, LOVE. -YEAH, SURE. -THANKS, DAVEY. I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN. SPOOKS, ARE YOU STAYING HERE? I SUPPOSE SO. SPOOKS HASN'T GOT A MOTHER, AND HIS FATHER LIVES IN SOUTH AMERICA. BUENOS AIRES, I THINK. I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM IN 14 MONTHS. WELL, YOU KNOW, CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT THERE. YES, I KNOW, EVEN CANNIBALISM. SPOOKS, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH US? WE'RE GOING TO A FARM UP IN THE NORTH. THANKS EVER SO MUCH! THAT WOULD BE SUPER! HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA BE UP THERE ON THIS FARM? HOW THE HELL DO I KNOW? -WHY? -WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SMASHING TIME UP THERE, AREN'T WE? YOU FORGET THE SMASHING TIME, JUST KEEP YOUR LEGS CROSSED. I WONDER WHAT DAVID WILL THINK ABOUT THE PIRRIES. WELL, DAVID WILL GIVE THEM SOME FOOD, THEY'LL BE ON THEIR WAY, NO PROBLEM. HOPE SO. BOYS, I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM PIRRIE. BUT I LIKE PIRRIE. DAVEY, I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT IT, NOW YOU'VE HEARD ME. YES, MOMMY. BUT THERE SHOULD BE A LOGICAL REASON. THERE IS A VERY LOGICAL REASON: I SAID SO. MAY I TALK TO CLARA THEN? -SHE'S NICE. -NO! FOR A COUPLE LOGICAL REASONS. THERE ARE REPORTS OF EVEN MORE SERIOUS OUTBREAKS, PARTICULARLY IN LIVERPOOL, MANCHESTER, AND LEEDS. IN THE CASE OF LEEDS, OFFICIAL CONTACT HAS BEEN LOST. IN VIEW OF THE DISTURBANCES, THERE IS SOME DANGER THAT THE COUNTRY MIGHT COLLAPSE INTO ANARCHY. A1 CLOSED EXCEPT TO MILITARY VEHICLES, SIR. WHAT'S THE REASON, SERGEANT? SOME SORT OF TROUBLE IN LEEDS, SIR. WHERE IS IT YOU'RE WANTING TO GET TO? WELL, WE LIVE IN WESTERLAND. I SHALL BACKTRACK ONTO YORK ROAD IF I WERE YOU. YOU GET OFF JUST BEFORE SELBY, YOU CAN GET INTO DONCASTER THAT WAY. I WOULDN'T GO NEAR LEEDS AT ALL, SIR. THANK YOU, SERGEANT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: THE DUTY OF RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS IS TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES. ANY VIOLATORS WILL BE DEALT WITH MOST SEVERELY. THEY'RE HEADING NORTH. DO YOU THINK LEEDS? MY GOD. IT'S INSANE TO HAVE TO WONDER LIKE THIS ABOUT OUR OWN AIRCRAFT. WELL... DADDY, MAY SPOOKS AND I RIDE IN ROGER'S CAR FOR A WHILE? IN THE LEAD SO WE CAN SEE THINGS BETTER? -NO. -IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO DECIDE. DADDY. DADDY, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, JUST FOR A WHILE. I SHOULD THINK WE CAN GET NORTH OF RIPON TODAY. RIPON? WE SHOULD DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT. IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT PUSHING THINGS. THESE ROADS ARE NOT SO GOOD. I'D LIKE TO GET THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, DARLING, EVEN IF WE DRIVE ALL NIGHT. AS LONG AS WE GET THERE. THE MAIN THING IS TO KEEP CLEAR OF POPULATION CENTERS. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. I WANT YOU ALL TO USE THE TOILET, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO STOP LATER. MARY, THOSE TREES LOOK OKAY. BOYS. CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, MR. CUSTANCE? UH, NO, NO. AREN'T YOU COLD? ME, COLD? NEVER. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? YOU EMBARRASS ME, THAT'S WHAT. I TOLD YOU NOT TO WEAR THAT BLOUSE. FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, YOU'VE ALL SEEN KNOCKERS BEFORE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOVE THEM DOWN THEIR THROATS. I'M WARNING YOU, I'M NOT TAKING NOTHING MORE FROM YOU. -BALLS. -THIS IS A NEWS FLASH. OWING FURTHER RIOTING IN CENTRAL LONDON, MARTIAL LAW HAS BEEN DECLARED BY PRIME MINISTER WELLING. WHAT AN IDIOT. TOO LATE AS USUAL. INFIDELS WHILE LONDON BURNS. ...IN SOUTH LONDON, AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE BY ORGANIZED MOBS TO BREAK THROUGH MILITARY BARRICADES SET UP EARLY THIS MORNING FOLLOWING THE TEMPORARY BAN ON TRAVEL. ARMY HEADQUARTERS EXPECT TO HAVE THE SITUATION IN HAND SHORTLY. OH, LOOK, WHY DIDN'T YOU PASS THEM? IT'S JUST A RIGHT DRAG, THEY CAN CATCH UP. WHAT'S HIS HURRY? COME ON, ROGER, YOU CAN CATCH HIM. HE HAS A SOUPED-UP ENGINE. OH, STEP ON IT, ANDY, STEP ON IT. WOULD YOU CATCH HIM, WOULD YOU? - COME ON. - WELL, IF I CATCH HIM THIS TIME, HE WON'T PASS ME AGAIN. WE'RE GAINING, WE'RE GAINING! DAMN, THESE BLOODY COUNTRY CROSSINGS. TAKES ALL DAY FOR A TRAIN TO GET THROUGH. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A TRAIN COMING YET. DON'T YOU THINK HE MIGHT LET US THROUGH? HE MIGHT FOR A QUID. HELLO? HELLO, COULD YOU LET US THROUGH, PLEASE? I'M JUST GOING... - JOHN! - DADDY! DADDY'S COMING! THEY'RE HURTING JOHN! HELP! HELP US! SOMEBODY HELP! PLEASE, HELP! HELP! PLEASE, SOMEONE, HELP! PLEASE! HELP! HELP ME UP. TRY TO REMEMBER. DO YOU KNOW WHICH WAY THEY TOOK THEM? NO, I PASSED OUT. THEY GOT YOUR CAR. PLEASE! OH, DON'T! PLEASE! - NOT HER! - LET ME GO! NO, GET OFF! YOU BITCH! HELP! SOMEONE HELP, PLEASE! PLEASE, HELP! COME ON, GET UP, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT. ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE DONE THE TALKING, NOW LET'S SEE THE CONTROLS. DON'T SHOOT! DON'T KILL ME, DON'T KILL ME. ANN, DARLING. -MARY. -ONE GOT AWAY. I DIDN'T HAVE A CLEAN SHOT. AND THIS ONE... DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE NO CHANCES HITTING MARY. BESIDES, THE GUILTY DON'T DESERVE TO DIE AS QUICK AS THE INNOCENT. JOHN, HOLD HER. MISSUS, DON'T LET HIM KILL ME! DON'T SHOOT! MISSUS, DON'T LET HIM KILL ME! I'M IN AGONY NOW, MUM. - GIVE ME THE GUN. - WHAT? GIVE ME THE GUN, PIRRIE! UNDER EXISTING MARTIAL LAW, A CURFEW FROM 8 PM TO 8 AM WILL GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY IN GREAT BRITAIN. ANYONE SEEN ON THE STREETS DURING THOSE HOURS WILL BE SHOT. GET AWAY FROM HERE! COME ON! WE'RE TAKING OVER! THIS IS THE, UH, CITIZENS EMERGENCY COMMITTEE IN LONDON. WE'VE TAKEN CHARGE OF THE BBC. THE FORMER GOVERNMENT HEAD, PRIME MINISTER WELLING, HAS FLED THE COUNTRY. STAND BY FOR AN EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT. GOD, IT'S ALL FALLING APART PRETTY FAST. THIS IS LONDON. WON'T ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS, DARLING. IT WON'T. THIS IS THE, UH, CITIZENS EMERGENCY COMMITTEE IN LONDON. OH, DO WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS BLEEDING RACKET ALL NIGHT? WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP? TALKING AND SNORING ALL THE TIME. STAND BY FOR AN EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS LONDON. WE BRING YOU THE FIRST BULLETIN OF THE CITIZENS EMERGENCY COMMITTEE. FACTS ARE THESE: WE FOUND THAT THE FORMER GOVERNMENT OF MURDERERS WAS ABOUT TO EXECUTE A PLAN TO DROP NERVE GAS BOMBS ON BRITISH CITIES. IT WAS CALCULATED THAT IF HALF THE COUNTRY'S POPULATION WERE MURDERED, IT WOULD ENABLE THE REST TO SURVIVE. BLOODY IDIOTS. THAT'LL REALLY START THE PANIC. ...ACTION BY CHINA IS BARBAROUS. STAND BY FOR FURTHER BULLETINS. GET HIM, GET HIM! GET AWAY, YOU LITTLE BASTARDS! OH, GOD, NO! GET THE STUFF, COME ON. THE EMERGENCY COMMITTEE IS MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR COLLECTING WHATEVER FOOD IS AVAILABLE AND HAVING IT FAIRLY RATIONED OUT. IF THE COUNTRY ONLY SHOWS THE SPIRIT OF THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN, WE CAN PULL THROUGH. ANY ACTION AGAINST THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE WILL BE SEVERELY DEALT WITH. STAND BY FOR FURTHER BULLETINS. STAND BY FOR WHAT? YOU KNOW, JUST TWO DAYS AGO, WE WERE STILL A CIVILIZED COUNTRY. IT'LL GET WORSE EVERY MINUTE NOW. NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE HAD GONE TO CANADA. OH, DARLING. -IT COULD'VE HAPPENED ANYWHERE. -WE WOULD'VE BEEN SAFE. MY DAUGHTER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RAPED. ALL THIS BECAUSE OF A BUILDING. BUT IF WE HADN'T LEFT, AND THINGS HADN'T GOT AS BAD, I'D BE AN ARCHITECT WHO NO ONE WOULD EMPLOY. I DID URGE YOU TO GO. YOU KNEW I WOULDN'T BECAUSE... BUT WITH YOU, IT WAS A BUILDING. NOBODY COULD FINISH IT EXCEPT YOU. ALL RIGHT, TIME TO MOVE ON. AND OLD CASSOP LOOKED LIKE THIS. BOYS, YOU STAY WITH ROGER. OKAY, DAD. YOU KNOW... I KNOW, DADDY. MOMMY'S JUST UPSET. MOSTLY ABOUT ME. POOR DADDY. CAN WE HELP YOU WITH YOUR WAGON? THANK YOU, NO. WE'VE ALL THE HELP WE REQUIRE. ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE OUT OF THE CARS. YOU FELLOWS SEARCH THE LOT. GET ALL WE NEED. COME ON, LADDY. GET OVER THERE. - HURRY IT UP. - COME ON. MOVE THOSE KIDS OUT OF THE WAY SO THEY DON'T GET HURT. I'VE FOUND SOME GUNS AND SOME AMMO. HEY, THERE'S SOME FOOD. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WE HAVEN'T DONE YOU ANY HARM. WE DO WHAT WE HAVE TO FOR OUR TOWN. SURVIVAL, MISTER. I GUESS YOU'VE HAD A TASTE OF THAT. THERE'S A PRETTY STIFF PENALTY FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THERE'S A WORSE PENALTY THESE DAYS: STARVING TO DEATH. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TAKE FROM US? ANYTHING WE CAN USE, MISTER. WELL, AT LEAST LET US HAVE ONE CAR AND SOME PETROL. -NO. -PLEASE, WE'VE GOT THE CHILDREN. SORRY, NO CAR. MY GOD. WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE YOU. SAME KIND OF PEOPLE YOU ARE, MUM. I HOPE IT HAPPENS TO THEM. TO HAVE NO FEELING FOR THE CHILDREN. IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. AT LEAST THEY LET US TAKE SOME CLOTHING. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PIRRIE? HEY, GOOD FOR YOU, PIRRIE. WHAT ABOUT AMMO? I THOUGHT THEY'D COME IN HANDY. THAT'S VERY INTELLIGENT, PIRRIE. EVEN WITH ONE GUN, NOW WE CAN FIND A FARM HOUSE AND TAKE A CAR AND SOME PETROL, AND PERHAPS ANOTHER GUN. GUNS, YES, BUT NO MORE CARS. A CAR'S ONLY AN INVITATION TO AN AMBUSH. VERY TRUE, MR. CUSTANCE. I BET YOU WERE A MILITARY MAN, AYE, SIR? MUCH TO MY REGRET, YES. WELL, OF COURSE. OH, NO. NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EYE. I JUST HATE KILLING. WE HAVE ABOUT 50 MILES TO DAVID'S. I THINK WE CAN DO IT IN TWO DAYS IF WE HAVE NO MORE TROUBLE. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT TODAY, BUT THE EARTH'S CLIMATE IS GETTING WARMER BECAUSE ALL THE POLLUTION IN THE AIR KEEPS THE HEAT IN AND THE POLAR ICE CAP WILL MELT, AND EVERYBODY WILL BE DROWNED. YES, I KNOW. AND THEN, NOT ENOUGH OF THE SUN'S RAYS WILL GET THROUGH NOW, SO EVERYTHING WILL DIE ANYWAY. WE'VE GOT NONE FOR SALE IF IT'S FOOD YOU'RE AFTER. WELL IT IS FOOD WE'RE AFTER, BUT WE'VE NOTHING TO PAY WITH. WE WERE ROBBED OF EVERYTHING, BUT IF YOU COULD LET US HAVE A FEW POTATOES. TOUCH ONE POTATO, I'LL FILL YOUR ASS FULL OF THIS! PIRRIE! ROGER! THEY HAD ANOTHER GUN. YES. LET'S GET THESE BODIES AND MOVE THEM TO THE CELLAR. OKAY, MR. CUSTANCE. I'M GLAD WE PICKED UP SOME GUNS. THAT'S IMPORTANT. DID THEY SHOOT AT YOU, DADDY? YES, DAVEY. WHERE ARE THE BODIES, MR. CUSTANCE? OUT OF THE WAY. EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW, BOYS. WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO LIVE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? LIKE IN THE WESTERNS? YES, LIKE THAT. HEY, SPOOKS, LOOK AT THIS FROG. WHERE? OH, YES. THERE WAS NO POINT IN WASHING UP, DARLING. I KNOW, I JUST WANTED TO. JOHN, I THINK I'VE GOT SOMETHING COMING THROUGH ON SHORTWAVE. GOOD. LET'S MOVE ON. THE SOONER WE GET THERE, THE BETTER. I HAD TO PUT A SKIRT ON, THEM TROUSERS WERE CUTTIN' MY CROTCH. BLOODY THING'S HAD IT. ...FRAGMENTARY, BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY... IN FACT, ALL OF WESTERN EUROPE, ALONG WITH A MAJOR PART OF ASIA, SOUTH AMERICA, AND AFRICA, HAS CEASED TO EXIST AS PART OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD. IN A MIDST OF COMPLETE ANARCHY AND MASS STARVATION, THE HORRORS OF CANNIBALISM ARE ALREADY WIDESPREAD. MY GOD. NUMBERS OF AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN ARRIVING IN CANADA AND THIS COUNTRY FROM EUROPE. BY ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT, THE PEOPLE IN THEM HAVE BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM. THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE AND SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AND MEMBERS OF THE BELGIAN ROYAL FAMILY ARE NOW IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS REPORTED FROM HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND ROYAL FAMILY HAVE LANDED THERE SAFELY. BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THOMAS WELLING SAID RUMORS THAT MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS IN ENGLAND WERE TO BE BOMBED, AS WERE DONE IN CHINA, WERE ENTIRELY UNFOUNDED YET CAUSED AN UNCONTROLLABLE PANIC. THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TODAY EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THIS WAS PART OF IT. WE AS A NATION ARE SHOCKED BY WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. HERE AT HOME... WELL. PIRRIE, YOU BETTER TAKE THIS, YOU'RE THE BEST SHOT. I'LL TAKE THE PISTOL. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. I'M READY, MR. CUSTANCE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, DARLING? DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE? YES. IT'S JUST... I FEEL THAT I CAN'T... I UNDERSTAND. ...EVERYWHERE. AND NOW, MORE THAN EVER, IN THE FACE OF THIS WORLDWIDE CATASTROPHE, WE MUST SURVIVE AND PRESERVE IN OUR NATION THE HERITAGE OF MAN'S GREATNESS. OH, LOOK, IT'S SO TINY. MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY A FEW DAYS OLD. WHY, JOHN? WHY SO MANY? THEY MUST HAVE EATEN DISEASED GRASS. THEY HAVEN'T LEARNED YET. AT LEAST WE CAN GET OUT OF THE WIND AND THE RAIN. YES. ROGER, PIRRIE. WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE TURNS ON GUARD DUTY. IT'S ISOLATED ENOUGH, BUT WE CAN'T TAKE CHANCES. CAN'T YOU SLEEP, DARLING? NO. YOU MUST TRY. THE GOING GETS ROUGHER AS WE GET FURTHER NORTH. I WANT TO BE SO TIRED THAT I CAN'T THINK OR FEEL ANYTHING. IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WHEN WE GET TO THE FARM. WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT? THAT WE'LL HAVE FOOD AND DRINK? IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN? WE'LL BE ABLE TO LIVE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS AT LEAST. SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT WE'RE LUCKY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THOSE MOBS FROM LONDON GET UP HERE? AND ARMY UNITS, THINK THEY'LL STAND BY AND OBEY ORDERS? WHOSE ORDERS? NO, WE'RE LUCKY, I TELL YOU. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ANYMORE. YOUR TURN FOR GUARD DUTY, MR. CUSTANCE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WANDERING ABOUT? WELL, I WASN'T WANDERING ABOUT. I JUST COULDN'T SLEEP. GOT A LIGHT? YES, BUT WE CAN'T SPARE MATCHES ANYMORE. OH, OH, YOU THINK OF EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU? YOU KNOW, I DON'T ENVY YOU ONE LITTLE BIT, MR. CUSTANCE, 'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT NOTHING HERE BUT PROBLEMS. AND WHY IS YOUR MISSUS GIVING YOU SUCH A HARD TIME? I DON'T WISH TO DISCUSS MY WIFE WITH YOU, MRS. PIRRIE. OH, CLARA. NOR DO I WISH TO GIVE YOU ONE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFTER. OH, COME ON NOW, THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH, IS IT? I MEAN, ABOUT NOT WANTING TO. IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S NO TIME, IS THERE? WHO KNOWS, TOMORROW WE MIGHT ALL BE DEAD. I THINK YOU BETTER GO BACK TO BED. WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN, BUT I'LL JUST SAY GOODNIGHT BEFORE I GO. THOUGHT YOU'D BE A BIT MORE CAREFUL ON GUARD DUTY, MR. CUSTANCE. NOW JUST A MINUTE, PIRRIE. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO BE NUMBER 1,669, DO YOU? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT SHE DID BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED DIDN'T BOTHER ME, KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. BUT AFTER... OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, I'VE HEARD THIS... AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR IT AGAIN, THIS ONE MORE TIME. LET GO OF ME, YOU'RE HURTING ME! I'VE GOT MY PRIDE, MR. CUSTANCE. I THOUGHT OF KILLING HER BEFORE, BUT THE PRICE WAS TOO HIGH. JUST WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, PIRRIE? I MEAN, THE LAW, THE OLD LAW. WELL, THERE ISN'T ANY NOW, IS THERE? IF THERE WERE, WE SHOULD ALL HANG. RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS, MR. CUSTANCE. SO WHAT KIND OF LAW IS LEFT? THE LAW OF THE GROUP FOR SURVIVAL. AND IN THE FAMILY. THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY, RIGHT? I'M THE LAW THERE. SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF THE GROUP, PIRRIE, ALWAYS. IT'S ALL RIGHT TO KILL FOR FOOD NOW, SO WHY NOT FOR MY SELF-RESPECT? OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU'RE BREAKING MY ARM! I WANT MY RIGHTS! NO, WE'LL SEND HER AWAY, SHE CAN FEND FOR HERSELF. THAT'S NO PUNISHMENT. SHE'S GOT SURVIVAL KEPT BETWEEN HER LEGS. OH, HELP ME! HE'S GONE CRAZY! OH, HELP ME! I WANT MY RIGHTS, MR. CUSTANCE. OH, LET ME GO! MY GOD, PIRRIE, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO? WE'LL HAVE TO TELL MARY AND THE BOYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. MY WIFE AND ROGER, I'LL TELL THE TRUTH. WHATEVER YOU SAY, MR. CUSTANCE. IT'S SO HORRIBLE, JOHN. WHY DID YOU LET HIM? I COULDN'T STOP HIM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE THE LEADER, HE HAS TO DO WHAT YOU SAY. IF HE THINKS THAT... NO, NO, NO, THIS WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL, PERSONAL. LET'S FACE IT, I'M NO MATCH FOR PIRRIE WITH A GUN. I'D ONLY HAVE GOTTEN MYSELF SHOT, TOO. AND MY BEING ALIVE, THAT IS IMPORTANT, IF WE'RE ALL TO GET TO BLIND GILL. I'M SORRY. OH, DARLING, IT'S ALL BEEN TOO MUCH FOR ME. I KNOW WHAT IT'S BEEN FOR YOU, I FORGET HOW HARD IT MUST BE. FOR YOU, MY LOVE, IS IT ANY BETTER? NOT QUITE SO BAD. BUT IT'S STRANGE. THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME MOST IS THAT I KILLED A MAN. GOOD GOD, ANN. JUST DID WHAT THEY DID. I KNOW, BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I DID. ROGER, KEEP THE BOYS BACK AND GUARD MARY. SHE'S ALIVE, SHE'S MOVING, I SAW HER! GET BACK, GO ON, GET BACK! OH, GOD! PLEASE... KILL ME. WELL, IT'S AROUND THE TOWNS, BUT NOW THE FARMS ARE GETTING IT TOO. I WONDER WHAT'S HAPPENING AT HOME, THE HOUSE. DON'T THINK OF IT. I CAN WALK NOW, MR. BURNHAM. DON'T START TALKING, I'M JUST A HORSE. REALLY, YOU COULD JUST CUT ME A CANE. SHUT UP, I NEED THE EXERCISE. I WAS INTO TROUBLE A LOT IN THOSE DAYS. WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE, PIRRIE? YOU KNOW, MARY, PIRRIE IS MY SURNAME. ANDREW. ANDY. CALL ME THAT. -OF COURSE, IT'S JUST THAT... -YEAH, I KNOW. ANYWAY... WHEN MY MUM TOOK OFF, I WAS 13 THEN, I STAYED WITH HIS AUNT AND HIS UNCLE. I WAS ALWAYS GETTING IT FOR SOMETHING. SO I PUSHED OFF, ME AND A PAL. SO, WE GOT CAUGHT ONE NIGHT. CAUGHT? DOING WHAT? PUSHING DRUGS. HOLD UP, LET'S TAKE A REST. I WAS PICKIN' UP 10, 15 QUID A DAY. ME AND MY PAL, WE GOT A YEAR IN BORSTAL FOR THAT. OH. AND THEN? WELL, YOU LIVE AND LEARN. UNLESS YOU'RE STUPID. I GOT THE JOB AND ROOM AND BOARD WITH OLD STURDEVANT. I HATED IT, BUT I LIKE GUNS. I CAN HANDLE ANY TYPE OF GUN. I USED TO SEE ALL THE WESTERNS. BILLY THE KID, DOC HOLLIDAY, WYATT EARP. MARY, YOU CAN COME UP HERE WITH ME NOW, DARLING. I'D LIKE HER TO WALK WITH ME. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WALK WITH YOU? WHY? WHY NOT? BECAUSE I WANT YOU AS REAR GUARD. SHE CAN WALK BACK THERE WITH ME. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? YOU WANT ME TO BE MORE EXPLICIT? I'M A WIDOWER NOW, SHE'S A SINGLE GIRL. YOU CRAZY, INSANE BEAST! ANN! STOP HIM, JOHN! STOP HIM! PIRRIE, THIS IS NEITHER THE TIME NOR THE PLACE TO DISCUSS SUCH AS THIS SORT OF THING. AND WE HARDLY KNOW YOU. I SUPPOSE IT MUST COME AS A KIND OF A SURPRISE. I CAN IMAGINE WHAT ALL OF YOU ARE THINKING, BUT EVERYTHING'S CHANGED. THE WHOLE WORLD'S CHANGED. THREE DAYS AGO. BUT I'M THE RIGHT MAN FOR HER NOW. YOU'RE CRAZY, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE! YOU KILLED YOUR WIFE, YOU'RE A MURDERER... WE ALL ARE, AREN'T WE? JOHN, I'VE GOT THE BASTARD COVERED, SHALL I? NO! WE CAN'T SURVIVE THIS WAY. I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT, MR. CUSTANCE, 'CAUSE ROGER'S GUN IS ON SAFETY. AND MINE'S READY TO FIRE. SO IS MINE, PIRRIE. I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO ACCEPT MY DECISION AS LEADER OF THIS GROUP, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING MY FAMILY. IF YOU FIRE FIRST, I MIGHT FIRE, TOO, SO MIGHT ROGER. AND IN ANY CASE, YOU'D NEVER GET INTO BLIND GILL. MR. CUSTANCE, IF ROGER, IF ANYBODY MAKES A WRONG MOVE, I'LL SHOOT YOU. AND I STILL THINK I COULD GET ROGER FIRST. MARY, COME OVER HERE. STAY HERE. MARY. MOTHER, DADDY, PLEASE. I WANT TO. REALLY. BECAUSE I FEEL SAFE WITH HIM. JOHN, DON'T LET HER, PLEASE DON'T LET HER. I TAKE IT WHAT PIRRIE WANTS IS TO GET TO KNOW MARY. IS THAT RIGHT, PIRRIE? YOU MIGHT PUT IT LIKE THAT, MR. CUSTANCE. IT CAN'T HURT ANYBODY, CAN IT? THAT'S THE SORT OF GROUP WE NEED, MEN WITH GUNS. ANN, MARY, BOYS, GO UP TO THAT POTHOLE AND WAIT THERE TILL I CALL YOU. BE CAREFUL. JUST A MINUTE. YOU WANTED SOMETHING? MY NAME IS JOHN CUSTANCE. WE'RE MAKING OUR WAY TO MY BROTHER'S FARM IN THE HILLS. IT'S IN A VALLEY THAT IS BLOCKED AT ONE END AND ONLY HAS A NARROW ENTRANCE AT THE OTHER. THERE'S FOOD THERE, AND IT'S EASY TO DEFEND. WHY YOU TELLING US ALL THIS FOR? WE'RE LOOKING FOR RECRUITS. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RECRUITS? WE ARE NOT. IN A FEW DAYS, MOBS WILL BE FIGHTING OVER EVERY POTATO PATCH. THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A BIT OF GROUND THEY CAN HOLD WILL TURN TO SAVAGES, IF THEY SURVIVE AT ALL. THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE. WON'T DO ANY HARM TO HAVE A LOOK. WHERE IS THIS PLACE? THAT'S MY BUSINESS, NOT YOURS. I'M THE LEADER HERE. IF YOU DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD, YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT. SO IT'S LIKE THAT, IS IT? WE DO WHAT YOU SAY. WELL, YOU CAN THINK AGAIN. I GIVE THE ORDERS IN THIS LOT, AND IF YOU WANT TO JOIN UP WITH US, YOU DO THE SAME. WHAT WE NEED IS BRAINS, MAN. THERE SEEMS TO BE A SAD LACK OF THAT IN YOUR FAT HEAD. YOU LITTLE BASTARD. THE OFFER STILL STANDS. ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME WITH US, FORM UP BEHIND ME. I'LL COME ALONG, AND ME FAMILY. WE'LL COME ALONG, TOO, MY WIFE AND I. THAT GOES FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. WELL, I THOUGHT HE SOUNDED REASONABLE. WE'LL COME ALONG, TOO. MY NAME IS PIRRIE, ANDREW PIRRIE, AND THIS IS ROGER BURNHAM. AS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TAKE YOUR PLACES, SHAKE HANDS WITH MR. CUSTANCE AND IDENTIFY YOURSELVES. I'M ALF PARSONS, I HAVE A WIFE AND DAUGHTER. BY THE WAY, THAT'S JOE ASHTON'S WIFE EMILY. EMILY. MY NAME IS BILL RIGGS, HAVE A WIFE, PRUDENCE, TWO KIDS, DENNIS AND FLORA, AND I'M VERY HANDY WITH A GUN. JOE HARRIS IS MY NAME, AND THAT'S MY WIFE LIZ. THE NAME'S SCOTT, MY WIFE. MY NAME'S LOCKE, THIS IS MY WIFE JILL. ARE WE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM? NO, NO PROBLEM, MR. CUSTANCE. JILL'S A STRONG GIRL. NO PROBLEM AT ALL. MY NAME IS REG BLENNIT, AND THIS IS MY WIFE MAUREEN. WE'D BE HAPPY TO JOIN YOU. OUR VILLAGE WAS DESTROYED YESTERDAY. WE BARELY GOT AWAY WITH JUST A FEW THINGS. MY NAME'S SURGIT. I HAVE A WIFE CALLED SHIRI. JESS ARKWRIGHT. MY WIFE SUSAN, THREE KIDS. I'LL SEE YOU LATER WHEN WE STOP. OKAY. DON'T BE ANGRY. I'M NOT, I LOVE YOU. ANN. DARLING, I CAN'T STAND IT. TRY TO HOLD ON TILL WE GET TO THE FARM. LET'S GET MOVING! HEY, WATCH OUT, THERE'S A DEAD CALF. DARLING, YOU CAN'T GO ON. YES, I CAN, WE HAVE TO. -LET ME DO IT. -NO, NO. DO AS I SAY. JOHN. JOHN, THAT RUINED MANSION LOOKS DESERTED. CAN'T WE STOP HERE? SOME OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN JUST CAN'T GO ON. - AND THAT PREGNANT GIRL... - THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE. I WARNED THEM. OUR SPEED CAN'T BE GOVERNED BY THE WEAKEST IN THE GROUP. WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER 25 MILES TO THE FARM. WHAT IF I'M THE WEAKEST, OR MARY? PIRRIE, I WANT YOU UP HERE. WOMEN AND CHILDREN STAY BACK. MEN WITH GUNS, MOVE UP AND SPREAD OUT. WHY PIRRIE? I'LL GO. NO, NO, ROGER, THIS IS A JOB FOR PIRRIE. LOOK, I WANT TO CARRY MY WEIGHT, JOHN. OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ROGER, THERE'S NO NEED TO RISK IT. THIS IS A ROUTINE THING. WE KNOW WHAT TO DO, MR. CUSTANCE. RIGGS, PARSONS. AGH! AGH! OH, MY GOD. OW! CAN WE GIVE HER SOME MORE WHISKEY? NO, NO MORE. IT WON'T BE LONG NOW. I WISH WE HAD A PROPER MIDWIFE WITH US. I'VE HAD TWO OF MY OWN. OH, GOD, HELP ME! SQUEEZE MY HAND. DARLING, YOU REMEMBER TO TURN THE BABY... YES, I REMEMBER. AGH! WE'RE ALMOST THERE. OH, I CAN'T WAIT. OH, DARLING, IT HURTS. TAKE SOME MORE GAS. NO! NO, I WANT TO BE QUITE AWARE. TAKE IT THIS TIME. BOY... TO SEE IF IT'LL BE A LITTLE MARY OR JOHN. OH. OH! HOLD MY HAND. AGH! ONCE MORE, MRS. CUSTANCE, PLEASE. WE'RE THERE NOW. BEAR DOWN. AGH! BEAR DOWN. AGH! IT'S A MARY. OH, DARLING, ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? CAN I SEE HER PLEASE? GOD REST HIS LITTLE SOUL. OH NO. JILL... I'M SO SORRY. DON'T, DARLING, WE'LL FOLLOW THEM. IT'S GUNFIRE. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON? WELL, I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GO NEAR IT.. BUT WON'T WE GET LOST IF WE... NO. ACTUALLY, I DON'T EVEN NEED A MAP UP HERE. NOT AS LONG AS I CAN SEE THE LANDMARKS. DAVID AND I DID, OH, DOZENS OF HIKING TRAILS THROUGH THE MOORS OF... IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, EVEN IF YOU MUST STRETCH A LITTLE, WHY DENY YOURSELF THE BEST? IMAGINE SETTLING BACK AND RELAXING WHILE YOU DRIVE A NEW ROLLS-ROYCE SILVER COMET. SEATS ARE COVERED IN SUPERB BRITISH LEATHER. FRONT SEATS GO UP AND DOWN, FORWARD AND BACK, TILT WITH FINGERTIP CONTROL. BROADLOOM CARPETING THROUGHOUT. EXQUISITE WALNUT WOODWORK. UPPER AND LOWER VENTILATION. YOU CAN WARM YOUR FEET AND COOL YOUR FACE AT THE SAME TIME. IN FACT, THERE IS VERY LITTLE YOU CAN'T DO IN A ROLLS-ROYCE. IF YOU'VE EVER CONSIDERED OWNING A ROLLS-ROYCE, THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT. LOOKS PEACEFUL ENOUGH, MR. CUSTANCE. EXCEPT FOR THE BARRICADES OF COURSE. WAIT A MINUTE. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE AND BACK INTO THE TREES. CORPORAL, BRING YOUR MEN AROUND THE BACK! GET THAT ONE AT THE WINDOW! CORPORAL, GET CLOSER! RIGGS, PARSONS. GO LOOK OVER THAT HILL, IF IT'S CLEAR, WAVE US ON, GO ON. A WALL OF BLOODY TROOPS. DOWN TO THE GULLY, GO, GO! ANN, GET BACK. LISTEN, YOU MEN. THOSE FOOLS DOWN THERE HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF MUTINY IN THE FIELD AND ARE GOING TO BE SHOT. I DON'T WANT MY MEN TO SHARE THE SAME FATE. NOW I'M WILLING TO FORGET THIS, AND I WANT YOU TO GO BACK TO YOUR BARRACKS. WHAT WILL WE DO THERE, SIT AND STARVE? THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT AT THAT BARRACKS. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK. YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING, THERE ISN'T AN ARMY ANYMORE. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES. BLOODY OFFICERS. SERGEANT MAJOR, TELL THE MEN TO FORM UP. SIR. CORPSMEN, FORM UP. WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT ON OUR OWN, GET OUT OF OUR WAY. REPEAT THE ORDER, SERGEANT MAJOR. AND ANY MAN WHO DOESN'T INSTANTLY OBEY IS COMMITTING AN ACT OF MUTINY IN THE FIELD AND YOU ARE TO SHOOT HIM. CARRY ON. FORM UP! NOW, THEY WAS ASKING FOR IT. SURE, THEY WERE THERE. COME ON, LET'S GO. WAIT. NOW. DAVEY! NO, YOU CAN'T DRINK THAT! IT LOOKS CLEAN, DADDY. WELL, IT ISN'T. LISTEN, EVERYBODY, THIS RIVER IS POLLUTED FOR MILES. DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN DRINK IT. YEARS AGO, DAVID AND I CAUGHT DOZENS OF FISH IN THAT RIVER. NOW, FACTORIES UP AND DOWN, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING TILL WAY PAST THE FARM. IT'S ALL SO BEAUTIFUL, DARLING. JOHN, DO YOU... WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME LIKE BEFORE DESPITE ALL OF THIS? I FEEL SO UNCLEAN. DARLING, I DO LOVE YOU. HEY, GET YOUR BLOODY... YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING! WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? I CAN'T TALK TO YOU REASONABLY. LISTEN, NO PAKI BASTARD'S GONNA PUSH ME AROUND. THAT WAS MY PLACE. LIKE HELL IT WAS! I PICKED THIS PLACE FOR MY WIFE TO REST! LOOK, I HAD MINE BACK THERE FIRST! THAT'S NOT TRUE! SURGIT'S RIGHT, I SAW HIM DO IT. BUT HE DOESN'T OWN THE... NOW PACK IT IN, BOTH OF YOU! PARSONS, YOU MOVE TO ANOTHER SPOT, BUT FIRST, I SAW YOU HIT SURGIT WITHOUT JUSTICE. NOW, SURGIT, YOU HIT HIM BACK. ALL RIGHT, LET'S FORGET IT, EVERYBODY. I'M SORRY. THAT'S OKAY. I DON'T KNOW, MR. CUSTANCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'LL DO. HE CAN'T GO ON, HE'S ONLY GOT ONE LUNG, YOU SEE. WHEN DID IT HAPPEN? OH, A YEAR AGO ABOUT. HE WAS WORKING IN A FACTORY IN FLATFORD. IT GOT HIS LUNGS. ALL THAT SMOKE. JUST A LITTLE REST, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU GO ON, AND I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU. OF COURSE. YOU GO NORTH UNTIL YOU GET TO THE ROAD, AND THEN YOU FOLLOW IT TILL YOU REACH THE FARM. WE'LL SEE YOU THERE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON, EVERYONE. DARLING, DARLING. ALL RIGHT, SET OFF! DARLING, DARLING. JOHN! HE'S THE ONE WHO JUST... YES, I KNOW, I SAW HIM, TOO. GET OVER THIS HILL BY THE ROCKS, QUICK, FAST, MOVE! HURRY! HURRY, HURRY, HURRY, HURRY! RUN, RUN! OVER THERE! HURRY, HURRY! COME ON! HURRY, HURRY! COME ON, THEY'RE GAINING ON US. UP HERE! QUICK, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK! COME ON! HURRY, HURRY! MAKE YOUR SHOTS. WELL-PLACED AMMO! I CAN'T LEAVE MY POTS! OH, FORGET YOUR DAMN POTS AND GET DOWN. STEWART, KEEP DOWN! STEWART! HEY, SPOOKS, THIS IS JUST LIKE CUSTER'S LAST STAND. I HOPE NOT. BILL! HE'S SHOT! HE'S DEAD. - MAUREEN! - MRS. BLENNIT! NO! MRS. BLENNIT, COME BACK OVER HERE! MAUREEN! -PIRRIE, GET HIM! -OH, SHE'S RIGHT IN LINE. MRS. BLENNIT! NO! OH! NO! COME ON, YOU BELLY-RUB BASTARDS, COME ON! NATTY SHOTGUN, IT WON'T REACH 'EM! AGH! DADDY! GET THE GUN, YOU CAN USE IT! I CAN'T, I CAN'T! HERE, ARKWRIGHT, USE THIS. PULL YOUR MANNERS OFF AND OVER THERE, LEAN ON THE BACK, AND WE'LL CLOCK IN ON THEM. -OH! -EMILY, DOWN! AGH! NO! AGH! DON'T LEAVE ME! I NEED SOME MORE SHELLS! SURGIT, GO ON WITH IT! LOOK OUT, HOLD IT UPRIGHT. GO ON NOW, HIT HIM, HIT HIM! AH, GET ON WITH IT! NOW IT AIN'T WORTH IT. WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. TREES HAVEN'T BEEN HIT AS MUCH UP HERE. THE AIR'S CLEANER. BUT THE GRASS... WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY CAN'T FIND A CURE? I DON'T KNOW. WE'D LIKE TO JOIN UP WITH YOU, SIR. I'M SORRY, WE HAVE NO MORE ROOM. PLEASE, SIR, THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE IS TO JOIN UP WITH A BIGGER GROUP. YOU COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH US. THE CHILD COULD BE CARRIED, JOHN, LIKE THE OTHERS. DO YOU HAVE ANY WEAPONS? WELL, THIS AXE HANDLE. THAT'S NOT MUCH USE AGAINST GUNS. I'M SORRY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON. -PLEASE. OH, JOHN. -NO, ANN, WE JUST CAN'T. THAT'S QUITE A FORTIFICATION. TRUST DAVID. IT'LL BE GOOD TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR SOME TIME. GET BACK BEHIND THAT WALL. WHO'S BEEN HIT? MY GOD, IT'S PIRRIE. YOU'RE NOT GOING. IT CAN'T BE DAVID UP THERE, HE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED YOU. IT'S MY OWN FAULT, A WHOLE BLOODY MOB APPROACHING WITH GUNS. MARY...MARY! GOT A SMALL GRAZE, MARY. NO, IT'S A GRAZE, THAT'S ALL IT IS. CAN YOU WALK, PIRRIE? I THINK SO. HELP HIM BACK, MARY. THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. IF YOU DON'T GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE, WE'LL AIM FOR YA. I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH DAVID CUSTANCE. I'M HIS BROTHER JOHN. OH, THAT'S IT. COME ON IN. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. JOHNNY, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. OH, IT'S VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO, BELIEVE ME. I'M SORRY ABOUT THE SHOOTING, THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU. SOMEBODY HURT OUT THERE? NO, IT WAS JUST A GRAZE ON THE HEAD. GOOD, GOOD, NOW I TELL THEM ALL HERE TO WATCH OUT FOR YOU, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D MAKE IT, WHAT, WITH THE NEWS OF THE BAN ON TRAVEL AND THEN ALL THE RIOTS AND THE RUMORS OF THE BOMBING. YES, IT IS A LONG STORY, BUT IT CAN WAIT. CAN I BRING MY LOT IN FIRST? YOUR LOT? YOU MEAN THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE, THEY'RE ALL WITH YOU? YES, WE'VE ALL BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR SOME TIME. BUT THEY CAN'T COME IN, JOHNNY. YOU AND THE FAMILY AND ROGER, THAT WAS AGREED FROM THE BEGINNING, YES, BUT NO OTHERS. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, THE FARM WOULD NEVER SUPPORT THEM. BUT MY LOT CAN EARN THEIR KEEP, THEY CAN PLANT SOME MORE CROPS. THAT'S NOT THE POINT, MISTER. THE LAND WILL ONLY SUPPORT SO MANY. WE'VE ALREADY HAD TO TURN OTHERS AWAY, RELATIVES OF THESE MEN HERE. IT IS YOUR LAND. NOT FOR NOW, MISTER, WE'VE ALL BANDED TOGETHER, WE ALL HAVE A VOTE. MY PEOPLE, WE FOUGHT TOGETHER TO GET HERE. SOME WERE KILLED. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE OUT THERE. I COULDN'T ABANDON THEM NOW. LOOK, THERE IS A WAY. TELL THEM THAT IT'S NO GOOD, THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE. TELL THEM THAT WE'LL LET THEM CAMP OUT THERE TONIGHT UNDER THE TREES, AND THEN YOU AND ANN AND THE CHILDREN CAN SLIP AWAY, AND ROGER. I'LL BE WAITING UP THERE TONIGHT FOR YOU. YES, THAT MIGHT WORK. SO THERE IT IS, WE HAVE TWO ALTERNATIVES. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE, OR FIGHT OUR WAY INTO BLIND GILL. THERE IS A THIRD ALTERNATIVE. YOU AND THE FAMILY COULD GO IN, AND SPOOKS, HE DOESN'T EAT MUCH. AND I'LL STAY OUT HERE WITH THE OTHERS. WHY SPOIL IT FOR YOU? WELL, THAT MIGHT GIVE SOME PEOPLE THE IDEA, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY WERE JUST BEING USED. RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. AND THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL. I AGREE. THE BEST THING IS TO FIGHT OUR WAY IN. DADDY? FIGHT UNCLE DAVID? WE HAVE TO. IN THERE WE HAVE A CHANCE OF SURVIVING, ALL OF US. I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE WE CAN PROTECT OURSELVES. BUT UNDERSTAND THIS, ALL OF YOU, I LOVE MY BROTHER. WATCH OUT FOR HIM. HE LOOKS A BIT LIKE ME AND HE'S GOT WHITE HAIR. I DON'T WANT HIM HURT. WE'LL GO IN WHEN IT'S CLOSE TO DAWN, WHEN THEY WON'T BE EXPECTING ME AND THE FAMILY ANYMORE. DAVID WILL HAVE GIVEN US UP BY THEN. THIS RIVER MAKES A PRETTY GOOD DEFENSE. ON THE BANKS IT'S DEEP, VERY FAST. ANY SIGN OF THEM, DAVID? NOPE. SHIT, IT'S COLD. THERE'S PLENTY OF COWS BEEN DROWNED HERE, AND QUITE A FEW MEN. WE'RE ON THIS SHELF THAT RUNS RIGHT ALONG THE MIDDLE. WE'LL HAVE TO GO FURTHER UP TO SEAL THE BARRICADE. HOW'S THE RANGE FOR YOU? NO TROUBLE AT ALL IF I CAN STOP SHAKING. THERE'S DAVID. -THE ONE STANDING? -YES. HE HAS THE WHITE HAIR. DON'T WORRY. THE MACHINE GUN FIRST. YOU TAKE THE MACHINE GUN, I'LL TRY THE ONE ON THE LEFT, BUT DON'T HIT DAVID. CHRIST ALMIGHTY. WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY? DOWN THERE IN THE RIVER. JESUS, I HOPE IT'S NOT JOHN. NO! THAT YOU, JOHN? NO! NO! YOU BASTARD! I'M SORRY, MR. CUSTANCE. THEY'RE UP IN THE BARRICADE. HERE THEY COME! PARSONS, HOLD YOUR FIRE! WHERE'S DAVID? WE HAVE THE MACHINE GUN. WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE KILLING, SO PUT DOWN YOUR GUNS! THEY'VE GOT A MACHINE GUN. GOD GRANT PEACE TO THE SOULS OF THOSE WE LOVED WHO LIE HERE, AND MAY HE FORGIVE US ALL FOR WHAT WE HAVE DONE. -AMEN. -AMEN. POOR GENEROUS DAVID. DARLING, YOU MUSTN'T BLAME YOURSELF. I'M NOT GONNA BLAME PIRRIE. IF PIRRIE HADN'T KILLED HIM, WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE? THIS MOTION PICTURE IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY, BUT IT COULD BE.
