- Where's Chris? - Laura, I'm here. The last one? Put it in this one. Let's speed it up, Chris! - Jacques, we meet up there? - OK. Let's go! Come on, guys, move it! Hurry it up. Let's pull out. THE WHITE KNIGHTS - Everything OK? - Yes. Open it. - Everyone OK? - And you? Yeah... Are you OK? Listen up. Things are tense. I'll ask you not to leave the camp without my authorisation. No one leaves without speaking to me first, OK? - Roland! - Yes. Explain the assignments. Listen to Roland. Chris and Yves, put the medical gear on the terrace for now. Luc and Christine, do the tents. Four here and four over there. Hold on, I haven't finished. Marie, Sophie, Nathalie, the dorm. - Your name again? - Hassan. - Hello, Hassan. - Show them the dorm. OK, let's get to work. - Paul? - Yeah? - The generator. - I need the blue bags. Let me help. Let's set out the tents. - You got the plane? - Yeah. - A good price? - Don't worry. This is your room. I put the safe here. The bathroom. The water tank's just outside. You have two gas rings here. The infirmary's back there. - It's pretty exposed. - It's secure, don't worry. - You're sure? - Yeah. I've put you some basic supplies here. - It's bigger than I thought. - The gas is OK. We redid all the wiring. So I see. The common room, with mattresses. Set it out how you want. At the back, the tents for the kids, with electricity too. - It suits you? - It's great. Thank the guys. They worked day and night to help. Xavier, water on Friday, OK? Yeah, thanks, Paul. Why Friday? That's when we get supplies. That's Françoise. The reporter I told you about. Make her comfortable. No worries. All right. Most of the children are here. The Cherokee flies this route. All right. Leaving when? 7 o'clock? It'll be too hot. We need to leave at 5. We can fly to this village here. Then... this one. A break there. How many villages in a day? Three maybe. Hassan? - He says four. - Four? Can you ask him if there are people in this village? Do you think Olafi has any children? Maybe, but I don't know how many. - Well? - It's good. If we bring in ten kids a day over thirty days, we're good for vaccines? Yves... On a practical level, are you ready? We will be by tomorrow evening, right? We'll be ready. We're all set, then. Ready to go at 5. - Great. - See you in the morning. Are you OK, honey? Xavier! Count it. It's what we agreed. We're doing this. Guys, don't stay up too late, we have a big day tomorrow. Good night. It's the starter. What's wrong with it? Didn't you check it? Hassan knows a guy who has one. When can he get it? If he goes first thing, he'll be back by evening. Can the plane fly? I did 15,000 km with it last week. It flies. That one was used for scouting? It's on stand-by for the mine teams. On stand-by? They need it if they have a problem. We have a problem too. I know... What do we do? Can't we sublet it? I'd be in the shit. Either we find a solution or we mend this plane. I only have a month here. Xavier! Ask them. I'll ask them, OK. Let them through! Stand back! Everyone calm down! Close the gate! Does anyone speak French? - You speak French? - Yes. Listen to me! We're here for orphans. We've come to look after orphans. Tell them. We're here for a long time, a very long time. Tell your friends, cousins, aunts and uncles that if they know orphans aged less than five... They must be under five. They can come and shelter them here. They will be housed and fed until they turn eighteen. In ten years, they will leave here with a diploma. I can't offer you all work. I need five nannies. Five! Tell them to be quiet. I need three schoolteachers. I need two cooks. And a translator, a man or a woman. Tell them. I can't hire more people than that. It's not possible. Now I want you all to line up over there. You're going to file by. We'll take your names and hire those who fit the bill. Is that clear? Let's stay calm! He apologises again. He hasn't had time to fetch the children. Next time, they'll be here. Tell him we have the plane for thirty days only. After, Xavier can't come back. Your village is too far. We'll find other kids in that case. Understand? Time, money, the plane, communication... All problems. You have to settle things with him. They need children here next time. I'll find them, God willing. Goodbye. You can take those children. No, they're village children. They want to go to school. Souleimane, we can't take everyone. Tell him we're paid to care for orphans. We told him that last time. Tell him we can't take everyone. They said they'd pay us. Without money, no children. Do they have money? No, Souleimane, that's not it. No children, no money. If there's no money, you can go. What did you say? He won't get money without any kids. Bintou, the money isn't to be used to buy kids. I'm paying for his help. Get this straight: we're not buying kids. The money's to pay for your help, Souleimane. Souleimane, how long will it take to bring orphans here? - Two days. - Two days? Two days? Big mistake. Xavier, let me handle this my way. Shit... Can we go? - Anything left inside? - No. Leave it. We need to anticipate such problems, Léa. If Xavier can't find the part, we're stuck. Check the figures. With 20% for unforeseen costs, we have 150,000 Euros left. How much of the 20% can we use? If I manage to find us a new plane, we'll have 100,000 left. That 20% is for unforeseen costs, so start looking. We can't count on Xavier alone. Yes, I'm here. I'm thinking. If we have to buy another one, we go ahead and do it. OK, I'll see to it. Once I know more, I'll call you. - Everything else OK? - Yes. We're settling in. You don't tell anyone about this. It's between you and me. What did she say? She's freaking out. The cops ran a check on our official approval, the budget, how many kids we're taking back, the allocation... But we knew that. Yes, but... Why are you surprised? This confirms they're not going to back down. But she held out? Yes, she did. She didn't mention Move for Kids? No, only Sud Secours. - We're off their radar. - OK, fine. Maybe the army could help. Out of the question. I don't want to bring them in again. They can understand. We didn't choose this situation. Luc, I don't want them involved in the villages with us. It's too dangerous. We're an NGO, remember? The answer's simple enough. We chill, take the 4x4s, see the village chiefs and get to work. It's feasible. Are you out of your minds? We only said it's feasible. No harm in thinking about it. 300 parents have paid 2,200 Euros to vaccinate kids due in Bordeaux. Xavier isn't an ace, but we can't stay stuck like this. A friend at UNICEF can give me the no-go areas. The army said no-go zones are everywhere. In the north, not near the border. This may sound weird to you but, in Sarajevo, a white flag always got us through. It's a code. It works, believe me. I don't want to get shot. Stop being so paranoid, guys, we can do this. We're not paranoid. You're fire-fighters. I can't put my medical team at risk. Fine, Chris, that's your decision. But we're here to get the kids. - So are we! - I accept the risks. - Who wants to go by 4x4? - I'm not going. - Me neither. You're mad. He says his men haven't found children. Tell him we took risks to come here. He promised us children. Where are they? He says his men take risks too. If you don't understand, fetch the children yourself. I want the orphans here next time I come. If this happens again, I won't work with you anymore. Tell him that. I won't pay for your help again for nothing. He understands. I don't understand. No... No, it's your baby. It's your baby. It's your baby. I can't look after it. Help me. It's your baby. She can't take it. It's your baby! Bintou! Come here! She can't take it. It's your baby! Bintou! Calm down. Explain to her. Get down! 641. Help Christine. - Are you OK? - Yes, I'm fine, girls. Come inside. What's that? We got shot at. What is this shit? The kids? Jacques! The kids? This is madness. You had a better solution? Stop playing soldiers! Get shot if you want, but don't put my team at risk, OK! We wait for a plane. Shut your mouth. - Watch it! - Shut up! He's letting off steam. What? Just calm down. No, you'll all calm down. It seems to me the village chiefs want to get rich. We haven't seen one child. It's tough for them. They're waiting. It's interesting for now. How are you doing? You went to Jacquet's? You're a darling. I miss you too. When I get back, let's take a break together. We'll manage it. Xavier, can I interview you now? Sorry, I have to go. I'm kind of busy. Yeah, I'll show you. Just a few questions. It won't take long. I hate being filmed. The village chiefs are the same. I just want your testimony to show aid workers aren't all scum-bags. - My testimony isn't interesting. - It is. If you want interesting testimony, see the UN fat cats who get rich. You'll get interesting stuff but filming them is easy. Can't you say that to the camera? - I can't. - Pity. Too bad. Françoise! - What was he saying? - He won't do an interview. - Why? Weird. - He hates being filmed. Sir, aren't you listening to me? I wouldn't give you the date. If Immigration learns about the ex-filtration, they'll be at the airport to send the orphans back! I'll give you news when I have news myself. I promise. When I have news, you'll hear from me. You're welcome, sir. Have a good day too. That's the toughest part. Not being here, but the parents. "When do you arrive? What date do you get back?" They're so self-centred. Nothing else seems to interest them. It's going to work out. You'll find a solution. Even one kid saved makes it worth it. Exactly. Whose is it? No, you can't. - Why not? - You can't take a game totem. Ready? One, two, three... Well? It won't be easy. Hassan's cousin is still looking for the part but it'll be OK. It'll be OK? We can't use the plane tomorrow or the day after? - Will you get the part? - I'll get it. Hassan has leads, but this isn't Orly Airport. Xavier, I'm paying you, remember. Things are different here. It takes time but it works out. What do I do if I can't take the kids back? - Trust me, please. - Trust you? Are you with the hunter or the lion? Cowboys and Indians now? - The plane situation seems to suit you. - Sure it does! How much d'you make each lost day? I'm getting rich off this? Think of our priorities! The way you act with the chiefs, you can manage on your own. Screw you! Get lost! With me, you don't threaten to leave, you threaten to stay! Nathalie, can I have the bread, please? Morning, everyone. You slept well? Can I have the bread? You're not on holiday. We're not on holiday? You could dress, couldn't you? How does this bother anyone? It's not cool for others. What's going on? - Can't you keep us informed? - Stop, please. We're here as volunteers. We should know. We're doing our best. Don't get worked up. We're not worked up, but we feel a bit lost. Surely they can ask questions? What'll you do if there are no kids to vaccinate? What'll you tell the parents? Our priority is the children. The chiefs have to do their job. Can't we do anything? We knew it wouldn't be easy. We have to stick together. Françoise, do you have to film this? Is there a problem? If your footage leaks before we get back, it's a disaster. Nothing will be shown before then. - Trust me. - Laura... When you called, I asked to film everything. You can't backtrack now. She's filming at breakfast! Forget it, it doesn't matter. She can't just film what suits us. It's no big deal. - That's not what she's doing. - I've stopped, OK! She's with us to help us. We can't refuse that. What happens if we get back with 300 kids and no proof of our work? What happens? They'll eat us alive. She's with us... Your decision. - Not mine! - Our decision. Yours! Work it out with her! It was my decision? No, it was a joint one! Don't tell me what to do with her! Not in front of everyone! Say it in private. Just try to keep your cool, OK. - Yes, sir. - What? Yes, sir. If you want to flash your ass for the camera... Laura! The kids are here. Françoise! Bring your camera. Take them over there. Come here. Tell him I thank him. Ask him to tell the children they're safe and protected here, and that we'll look after them. Hold on, there's enough for everyone. Can we have one? Close your eyes now... Ayan, 15 kg. Very good. Abdou, 93 cm. His name's Yassine. He's four. His mother died two months ago. His father was a soldier. The rebels killed him. Open your mouth. I'd say three and a half. Laura, can you explain what you're doing? Their teeth give us a precise idea of their age. There are no health records here. How do you verify a child's identity? It may seem flimsy, but we compare information from village chiefs and fieldwork. Without ID cards or state records, it's complicated but, as they say, nothing is risk-free. Doesn't that worry you? Can you stop for a second? Don't say "flimsy". Say we have no choice. - It's the same. - It isn't. "Flimsy" trivialises it for people. "No choice" means we have no choice. Sorry, it's an admission of weakness. The next one? Can I film again? So this is Chris. How old is he? How old is Chris? He doesn't know. Ask who filled out these certificates. - Who? - The villagers. The villagers shouldn't do it, he should! He's the chief. He's the one responsible. They can write lies on these! They could even be fake. How can I know? I have to take his word? All these are way too old. No way is that one aged four! What's going on here? What is all this? You're not being honest with me. Tell him he's not being honest. Only two are the right age. The others are over five. Why? What's going on? If he's not straight with us, we'll stop coming. What are you saying? They want to go to school... No. Tell him I'm sorry, but I can't do that. I can't take them all. He has to understand that! You're not being honest, Souleimane! You know, Françoise, I started school when I was seven. In the village, it's not a problem if children are too old. It's not fair. Why not take them to the camp? They have to choose. They can't take every child. That's how it is. No, not the shoes. Let's put this on. Benoît? It's Jacques Arnault. I can't hear you. There's a delay because of the distance. How are things going? Very well. I'm calling because we're doing the allocations. OK. We're going to give you a little boy called Moussa. He's five and he's a great little kid. He's in excellent health and I wanted to know if that's a problem for your family structure. Not at all, we're delighted. That would be wonderful. OK. I'll email you as soon as I can with all the information. His full name, his age, maybe a little photo too... Can you hear me? Yes, I... If we don't have time to send it, you already know his name's Moussa. What can I say? I'll let you give the news to your wife. Yes, of course. You'll be... Thank you. You'll be hearing from us soon, OK. All right, I'll tell her. - OK... - All the best. Love to you both. What police investigation? What are they accused of? They don't need approval. The parents' group does the adoptions. Can you hear me? Yes... That's why they changed names... No, they've always been up-front. The parents know the risks. They want to create a diplomatic incident. France can't deport 300 kids who are war refugees. They've always been up-front about that. They told me the day I met them. Exactly, it'll make waves. I promise. I promise I'll be careful. I'm going now. Talk to you soon. Try it again. Go on. Again. It's no use. - Nothing. - Stop. Monsieur Jacques! Bintou! Come here! She wants to see her son. He's here. No, he isn't here. Olafi brought him. She wants to see him. What's her child's name? His name's Sala. All right, fetch Sala. Luc! Is Sala with you? - What? - Sala! Bintou, reassure her. Reassure her. Tell her... if he's her son, she can take him. She wants you to keep him here. We can't. That's impossible. We only take orphans. She can't feed him. Olafi said you help children. Tell her it's not possible. - She promises not to come back. - We can't, OK! Is that her son? Is he Sala? How did this child arrive at the camp? - How did he arrive here? - No idea, she's his mother. Are you blind or what? - Olafi lied to us. - Of course he did. He isn't bothered if they're orphans. He's getting rich off us. Sophie, it's not just about money. How much does Olafi make? 30 or 40 Euros a month? You throw money about in the villages, not us. We get the message. We double-check every file and every kid, OK? Open your fucking eyes. What do you want to check? - You can't check a thing! - I can. We trust the chiefs and the children. - They don't cheat. - Talk about naive! Enough. Chris is right, there's no way of checking. The kids have no ID and the chiefs lie. We cancel everything or come clean about the evacuation. No, vaccination. Stop! If the authorities find out, they'll arrest us all. We can't abandon the kids because of some crooked chief. He's not crooked! They come to get help! And we keep lying to them. Yes, we do. We have no choice. What else can we do? As I said, we check each child and each file. We go over every single file. However long it takes. OK, but count me out. I'm not going along with this. If you're not up to it, it's wiser. Right, I'm not up to it! It's easy to split when it gets tough. You never believed in this. What do you mean? I've worked six months with you! Enough! Shit! We don't force anyone! If anyone wants out, too bad. Too bad for the kids too! Fuck this... You're just a coward. What? You're scared, that's all. You're afraid. - Yes, I'm scared. - It's obvious. What planet are you on? I'm not lying anymore. Yes, that's true. You're right. Go back to France. Send a cheque to "Third World Kids" to feel good. It's easier. Did she ask Olafi if she could send her son here? No. So he suggested it? Bintou... Ask if he gave her money. Did Olafi give her any money? Nothing at all? No, nothing at all. Sophie, the lamp... Keep it, you'll need it. - Are you ready? - I think I forgot something. What are you going to do? - What do you mean? - Are you staying? Yes, but it's different. Why? - I'm doing a report. - Precisely. You can't just let it happen without reacting. - But that's not my role. - So what is? To finish what I've started. The easy way out. "I saw nothing, I did nothing." What are you implying? It'll be a great report. Picked your side? Everyone ready? What happened? They wanted to go, so they're going. Will you manage without them? We'll work it out. Good morning. Shall we get going? The meeting room in ten. Go on... Sarah... No problem. Akram... Akram's the same. We check Akram out. If there's any doubt, we don't take them. But you can't be sure. No. But there's always a risk, Françoise. We have to face facts. It's impossible to be categorical. There aren't adoptive parents anywhere who can be totally sure of the status of their adopted child. That's why organisations examine the kids' origins. I've never come across adoptive parents who could swear that their child was without its parents. I don't know if the organisation that gave me my kids told the truth. The important thing is to have love to give. Something for them. If parents come forward here after the children leave for France, what happens? Take Sala, for instance. If that happens in France, if a parent comes forward... We'll decide then. Maybe we'll bring him back. We know the village chiefs. We have contacts here... We know the kids' origins. It'll be a shock for the adopters. Yes, it will be a shock. Do you have a solution? Any suggestions? I don't have any myself. Take me, for instance. If my girls want to go to Vietnam to find their family, I certainly won't stop them. You need to remember they don't adopt right away. They're foster families at first and only adopt after a few years. That leaves time for demands. Yes, that's important. Me, Françoise. You? Hamid. Can I film you? Yes? With the camera? Olafi, don't lie. This woman... Do you know her or not? I'll ask you again. Do you know this woman or not? Tell him I didn't fly two hours to hear crap! Don't lie to me! Olafi, don't lie. If you know her, say so. Or we'll be in trouble. Do you know her or not? OK, he knows her now. These children... Does he have parents? They're all orphans. No, I'm asking him if this child has parents. This one here. - He says no. - This one? - What does "la" mean? - No. Him? Him? Her? Hold on a second! Calm down, I'm just taking photos. They're just photos. There's no problem. I'm taking photos. You filmed them, right? - Yeah. - Can we work with your footage? No. I'm sorry, but I can't let you. It's to check with the kids. That's not why I'm here. Without your footage, I can't check their identities. I'm sorry, but that's not my job. What'll it cost you? - Matter of principle. - Principle? I don't see what it'll cost you. What would it have cost you to tell me your legal problems? - What? - Why didn't you tell me? I never told anyone, you or anyone else. Maybe I was afraid of scaring them off. How does that make me look? My editor tells me and sees I didn't know. - How do I look? - Me, me, me... Cut it out. I talk about kids and you just talk about yourself. Aren't there more important things? I guess a report on an outlaw is easier to sell. - You know that's not why I'm here. - No, I don't. Why are you here? I'd like to know. Luc! Yves! Come to the infirmary! Stand aside, let me see. They've been burned, get them inside! Have you got him? - Help me! - I'm here. Take him. - Got him? - Yes. - I need help here! - Coming! There's one more! He says they opened fire on the men. Then they took the village women away to rape them. They locked the children in a hut and set fire to it. They ordered the village men to dig a hole. Five women had to get into it. They were crying. They covered them with sand. Cherif managed to hide and free the children. After, they came here. Christine, if there's any problem, fetch me. Try to rest. Some kids are too old, others are injured... They may even have parents. Can we pass them on the UNHCR? No. If they ask questions, we've had it. - I won't send them to be killed. - Us neither. - I won't send them back! - You're a drag! I don't get it. You wanted kids. Why the big guilt trip? Their village has been burned down. What do we do? I'm thinking. We take them to Olafi... and give him funds to look after them. There's no other way. Bintou... Does Yassine have parents? A father or a mother? Ask him. Rebels killed their parents. The village was destroyed. He can't keep them. - What? - Her husband was killed. If he stays here, her son will die. With you, he'll be safe. Tell him we'll take them on one condition. He has to entrust them to us 100%. They can't visit them at the orphanage. They'll never see them again. Why can't they visit the camp? That's the one condition, Olafi. If we take the kids, they can't visit. It's not possible. What if they change their minds? We'll bring them back here. Olafi... Tell Olafi this is for the village, not for the children. He thanks you for saving their children. May God bless you. Jacques, I talked to Martin and we saw some specialists. They all told us the same thing. After the age of five, it gets complicated. There's a danger of... We don't want to take the risk of not forming a bond. - You said Ismael is seven, right? - Yes, seven. What do you mean exactly? Seven, Jacques... It's too old. If we can't forge a bond... We're not ready to go through that... We can't do it. It may be hard to accept but... I don't want that bond to fail. I'm sorry. We can't take him. I'm sorry. Really, I am. We can't take him. Don't be sorry. I understand. I'll keep you posted on further developments, OK? I hope you'll find him a family. We hope so too. Right... Talk to you soon. Bye. Goodbye. This can go on for hours. Refusing a kid because of his age... How selfish can you get? So we hope they get found and taken to a local dispensary? We know how they treat girls... I'd never forgive myself. I'll take Assya and Bouchra. Roland, I've known you forever. This can't be some vain act. They're two human beings. I know. I have two more at home. I'll call Nadine. I know she'll agree. Sorry, I can't do anything for Ismael and the others. Hold on a second... 9.5 kg. Cough. That's good. Again. Cough... Laura! Roland! Come here, sonny... - Did it go OK? - Yes. I'll do two more trips. Ismael, to get better, you have to eat. Come on. Eat. OK, I'll eat it, then. Delicious. Your turn. You'll like it. I never agreed to a 300-seater. The runway can't take it. - I told you so. - The runway's perfect. We hired a Boeing. It'll land here no problem. - Impossible. - Why? I'm sorry. - A 111-seater? - Not 111. Let me work this out. You don't even have 100 kids. - Got a 111-seater? - No, sir. I've hired a 737 and a 737 is going to land right here. A 737 can land. Take-off is the problem. It has to turn round. - What's the problem? - It's too narrow. We can widen the turn area, right, Roland? That'll cause problems and delays. I'll take care of it. If we widen the turn area, - can the Boeing land here or not? - No. I don't have the steps for it. I'll build the steps. Come here, please. Will 10,000 settle it? - 20,000. - Too much. 15,000. - 20,000. - No, not with the work to be done. For that plane to land, others have to turn a blind eye too. Saturday, block the runway from 6 to 7 a.m. No other take-offs or landings, OK? The thing is... He's too old, nobody wants him. No, there's no other way to help him. Exactly. No, giving him money is no good. He won't benefit from it. No, I'm not tired. No, I'm not tired. Right, later... I don't know. I don't know that. No. But if we want, we can. I don't care about whether he'll adapt! That's not the problem, it's... No, you're not ready. You're not ready. You're not ready now and you never were. No. You're not... Sure. We'll talk about it later. Take them back to the village. No way, we're not coming back for just two kids. Help them on board. I'm not taking off over capacity. They're just two kids. Even way out here, there are rules to respect. - Who's not respecting them? - Nobody. - Come on, who isn't respecting the rules? - Nobody. They're not boarding. Take them back. Get in. - I said no. - They're getting in. They're not. Period! It's my decision, not yours! - It's not my decision? - No, it isn't! - Fuck, you piss me off! - Put them in the plane. - It's my plane, OK! - But I'm paying for it! You're so cheap! Shame on you! Shame on you too, with kickbacks on every landing! Shut it! - I'm through with you! - Same here! Want to go up there? Look, it's going to be fun. It's perfect. How did you explain this to the nannies? We said it builds up leg muscles. - Come on, Ismael! - Go on, climb. - Come on. - Look... I'll help him. Don't force him. Pick him up. Don't be afraid. Let's climb the steps together. Come with me. Come on. Come with me. Let's try it together. Forget it, it doesn't matter. We'll try later. He mustn't panic. Who's next? He'll climb it. Don't worry, he'll climb it. The whole team here has decided to thank you for your help, your kindness and the way you look after the children... As well as everyone in the kitchens and camp... The whole crew... We've decided to give you two days off. Sure you don't need help? No, that's kind. We'll see to the children together. We'll just keep Kaltuma and you, Bintou. Also, today's work will end at 6 as usual, then you can go home to your families. And we'll see you on Monday. Ismael? Can you go cooee? Go cooee. Cooee. With your hand. That's the lion. The lion hates fighting so he's going away. To a place without war, to France. Want to come too? Want to come to France with the lion? Look, he's going. Want to come with me? Ismael, do you want to come with me? Yes? Yes? Go cooee. With your hand. Bintou... Can you come with me? Sit down. Bintou, we're taking the plane back to France tomorrow. We're taking the children. We're not staying 15 years. We lied to you. French families are waiting to take care of the children. Give me the letters. If the authorities question you or Kaltuma... I've written a letter as proof. You won't be held responsible. I'm the one responsible. Me and no one else. OK? So... you can show them the letter. The rent is paid until the end of the month. You can use the buildings. We'll leave you the medical equipment and... the food and all the rest. They'll be well looked after, don't worry. Trust us. Children, you have to sleep. What are you doing? What did we say? You have to sleep to be in shape for tomorrow's surprise. We're going on a long journey. Here, a walkie-talkie each. Here, Roland. - Give this to Laura. - OK. Anyone seen Bintou? Yves? No, haven't seen her. Start waking the kids and Kaltuma. I'll check her room. They're getting up. Luc, can you take this? OK, got it. Got everything? OK, you can close it. Go on. - That's it. - Kaltuma! - What's up? - Where's Bintou? Where's Bintou? She's left? Let's load the kids and go. We're splitting. Jacques... Here, the bandages. If there's a problem, we say they're injured. Roland! Mind the barbed wire! Let's go. Roland to Jacques. Go ahead. In front of us. Watch out. Jacques to Roland. Yes? Keep going. Same speed. What's up? Nothing, Laura. - Jacques to Roland. - Copy. Turn off when you can. Let's get off this road. Copy. What the hell? Jacques to Roland. - Copy. - They've turned back to follow us. What do we do? Jacques to all cars. If anything happens, no one panics. No one gets out of the cars, you hear me? No one gets out of the cars. I'll do the talking. Luc, do you copy? Copy. - Laura, do you copy? - Yes. We're an NGO! I have injured children! I have injured children! They're sick! It's a French army operation! Listen to me! Listen to me. Can I speak? This is them? Yes. She's with them. So is she. He is too. So is she. The chief. And that one too. Put them in the cars and take them to jail. I'm not with them! Tell them I'm a journalist, Bintou! Tell them I'm a journalist!
