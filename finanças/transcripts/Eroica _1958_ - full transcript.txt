They're generating electricity. Keep working! I've had enough. It always begins with a drill. - I'm splitting. - Where to? Risking life for a drill is not my thing. Kisses. Volunteers, fall in! Form a double line! Jurek and Wladek, follow me! Get inside, Jurek! Hurrah! The Germans let people out of Warsaw? They haven't left Wilanow yet. You'll sneak in. Thank you. - Oh, God! It's you, sir. - Good evening. God! Babyface! You're here? Alive? I see you manage quite well. - Is he from the Todt organization? - Please. He's the Lieutenant of the Hungarian Hussars, the general's aide... - Can he speak Polish? - No. Introduce me. Lieutenant lstvan Kolya, My husband. Nice to meet you. Well, shall we have a drink, Mr. Hungarian? Where did you find a Hungarian Hussar? It's quite easy since Zalesie's full of Hungarian troops. They requisitioned a room for him upstairs. Upstairs? You two will be comfy. So... Cheers, Mr. Hungarian! Salami... ham... - A gift from the general. - You sure are hospitable. Remember, money's running out. We left everything in Krucza St. - You're sleeping with him? - How can you... I know you. You couldn't resist such a brunette. Cheers... Mr. Lieutenant. Are you coming from Warsaw? No Warsaw. Radom. Mother sick. Don't mention I was in the Uprising. One gets a bullet in the head for it. - He's not in love with Hitler, is he? - No. - We weren't discussing politics. - I would think not. - Budapest beautiful city. - So is Warsaw. Warsaw not. Bandits. - Get it? - Not bandits. Patriots. Polish patriots. In Warsaw patriots, in Budapest patriots, in Berlin... Bandits! Cheers. - Poles and Hungarians are brothers. - A walk? - A walk? - Warm. Blackout. A walk. You wish. I've just walked 20 kilometers. - Curfew. - No curfew for me. We'll go together. - I like Polish ladies. - I can see that. He's drunk. Tell him, that I'm sleeping here tonight. Babyface! We're going? A beautiful night. Go. Curfew... Germans. Not Germans. Hungarians. What? What? What? - Go on. - Go where? Please. - I'll get whacked, dammit. - What? I'll get whacked because of that slut. What? Move. No! Enough. Ain't going any further. Shoot! Damn it! What's this?! What the hell is this? What is that? - Cannons. - Cannons? Zosia told me. You came from Warsaw. Uprising officer, right? What a slut! Yeah, I'm a Polish patriot. A commander. Hitler's dead. We want to help Polish patriots. You want to help? - With guns? - Yes. - Cannons? - That's right. Geez! Drink, brother. Or should I say brother-in-law. Heil Hitler. Who are you? Lieutenant Kolya of the Imperial and Royal Hungarian Army. Just like in the Austro-Hungarian times. Where are the headquarters? The headquarters? In that school on the left. Heil Hitler. I'm Off. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow. One down. Go! Greetings for Zosia! Look. He had a Luger. Got any bullets? Let me see what he's got. That's the one from the cab! I set that one up for you. - Speak! - Take me to the commander. Escort him. - Is it far? - Over here. - Babyface! - Lola! What are you doing here? - And you? - I'm here to see the colonel. I'm on a very important mission. I thought you were keeping an eye on Zosia in Zalesie. Babyface a conspirator! I had no idea. Sure you didn't. In your position... I really am in a hurry. Where can I find you? Here, at the communication center. They call me Blueberry. Bye. - I'll see you later. - Over there. Straight ahead. - Who are you? - Gorkiewicz. I'm coming from Zalesie. - Hungarians are there. - So? They want to help. Ten thousand men, cannons, bazookas, tanks... - What? - I'd taken care of that for you, but they demand a written confirmation from the Uprising command. Is that so? Did you get through to Downtown yet? It's still via London. The landline's still out. - All right. - Calling Downtown via London? Now tell me the whole story. We have really far to go, major. Quiet. No ranks. We met by accident, en route. If we get separated, we'll meet in Zalesie. No 6 Pilsudski Street. Poor Marshal. Maybe he's better off dead. If anything happens, the papers are hidden in the sole of my left shoe. I've got something better up my sleeve. Two gold five ruble coins. If anything happens, give them to my wife. Or better give them to the orphans. They're on their way to the city. If it worked outwith Hungarians, we'd have an anti-aircraft artillery. We'd wait for the Reds and... Where are they, for God's sake? In Otwock. You really screwed up that uprising thing. - You really couldn't make better plans? - With whom? The Reds. It's been two weeks and they still hadn't reached Warsaw. The Germans pushed them off. And there were no plans to make, since they don't recognize us as a country. Oh, my! So who's gonna chase the Germans out of Warsaw? You? - Them. - Get up! - This is the Polish tragedy. - The first column, move out! - Didn't you study history? - Let's go, major. I live in Krucza Street. - By Narcissus. ls it still there? - Probably. - Germans let people out of Warsaw? - They do. - Escorting your uncle? - Chickening out? - Don't like it here. - Let's take him to the fort. - Kiss my ass. - Leave that scum. Move! Clear the right! Do you have to limp? I really have a limp. - I'll help you, miss. - Thank you. You! Help her! - Carry it! - Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. - Take it. - God will reward you, sir. Jesus! Why are you taking all this rubbish? - I carry all I have. - On someone else's back. - Move! - I'm moving. Can't you throw some of it away? - You wanna kill me? - Easy for you to say. And who will replace it? All I had is either buried in ruins or burnt. I'll pay you. I'll build you a stove. I'll give you an electric iron. Where will I find you? What's mine is mine. - You're young and strong. - Move! Faster! - You old whore! Your junk'll kill me! - Shame on you! Germans are more understanding than a fellow countryman. - I'll give you 5 rubles for this junk. - Real ones? Of course! You'll get all the junk of the world for it. - Well? - Fine. Take some out. Enough! Enough! I'll carry it myself. Stop! Jesus Christ! Move on! Keep going! Some life, huh? - We have to get back tomorrow. - Not me. You can send me the medal. Come to my place to rest. You're falling off your feet. You're not the infantry, huh? Or you know what? Let's go for a swim. - First the Hungarians. - Hungarians? They're over there. Let's go. Yes? We've come about the meat. One second. See that cognac? I could go now, but I'll stay a little longer. I'm curious how the story unfolds. Come in, please. You better wait out here. - Hi! - Hello! You must go back to Warsaw at once! - Are you crazy? - Hungarians have conditions. They need an answer by lunch tomorrow. BY lunch? I'll be sunbathing by that time. I'm not your messenger boy. Do it yourself. Three days won't be enough for me. I got blisters. Get a cart and four mules. - Will they give cannons? - Three to start with. - We'll just have to transport them. - Well, that's no problem! I'll just take one and draw it to Warsaw. Hear that? Will you give me a letter? No. Only word of mouth. Hungarians got their marching orders. They're leaving tomorrow. They'll join us, if we guarantee that the Soviets will accept them as allies. Is it worth the trouble? You've no contact with the Russians. It's two divisions we're talking about. We can't just say "no" to them. Babyface! Here you are at last! I see you're doing quite well. lstvan will be back soon, huh? We're not alone. Introduce me to this gentleman. Professor Teofil Kozlowski. My wife. - The professor will stay with us, doll. - And you? I have to pop out for a while. The professor will tell you all about what he went through in the Uprising. - He's a famous numismatist. - Mumi... what? Nothing. Make some food. I'm leaving in half hour. Let's go, professor. Babyface! You don't love me anymore! Stop! Go back! I must get to Warsaw. My mother is sick. I'll take her and return in no time. It's forbidden. Bandits in Warsaw. Yes, bandits, plutocrats, the Soviets, commies, but my dear morn sick... - My beloved mommy! - Get back! Move! Please, man. Let me see her before she dies. Wait... The last one. - Freeze! - Don't turn around! Good evening. We know each other. - You're back. - Yes, I am. And the Germans let you in? Just because they liked you? Not really. Put the gun down. It makes me sick. - How can we be of service? - Take me to the commander. We will, we will... Boys, take him to the MPs. Is it worth it? He stinks of a rat. - Let's just whack him here! - It's time sensitive matter. - The colonel's waiting for me. - Sure he is. The MPs will have a chat with you. Take him! Great! All we needed was a lamp. Let's end this farce. I must convey an urgent matter to the colonel. - The fate of the Uprising depends on it. - Answer the questions! What were you doing before escaping from Mokot√≥w? Nothing. I was hiding in a basement. - Where? - At Saint Elizabeth's. - With who? - With a whore. - What's her name? - Don't know. They don't introduce themselves. What were you doing during the occupation? - Trading. - In what? In anything. Gold, planks, watch hands. And you? You lived by your own labour? - Who can confirm that? - Your colonel! Tell him Gorkiewicz has come from the Hungarians. What do you have to do with the Hungarians? We share a border, eternal friendship, and a wife. - Let's be done with this, dammit! - Quiet! Take him to the cellar! Cut! You'll be taken to the commander. Finally. You'll be thanking me like a hero when the time comes. Sure. Sure. - Colonel... - Wait here. - We must give them those guarantees. - Hold on a minute. - It's boring here. - Nights are always boring. I'll be transferred to Belgijska St. Germans are nearby. The whole street's dancing. But it's easy to lose your head in such a dance. - You gotta live life to the fullest. - Messenger! Know what? I'm trying to get hold of a Sten. - Where's that from? - It's a rail cannon at Okecie. Mr. G! - Did they agree? - Hide this slip well. - Or learn the numbers by heart. - By heart? No way. You must give it to the Major by 4 pm tomorrow. Good luck. How will I pass through? Everyone's pointing their guns at me. - Someone will finally shoot me. - I said you'll get a medal. And it's gonna help how? Colonel, is that Hungarian thing gonna work out? It'd be a shame to waste such an opportunity. You'll leave before dawn. We'll inform the guards to let you pass. You're so reluctant. Freeze! Password! How should I know? - Put it down! - I have no bullets, anyway. I wanted to see Cherry... no, Blueberry! Blueberry's down there. - Good night. - Night. - Babyface! - Hi. You're alone? Yes. Everyone's asleep upstairs. Don't get too affectionate! I'm on duty. And I'm engaged. I've never been lucky with women of principle. - Speaking? I'm switching off! - Got any food? They promise you medals, but forget about dinner. I have potatoes. I'll warm them up. Watch the switch. - If it goes down, call me. - OK. Lola! Four of them went down! Lola! It's the explosion! Make a fire! Fox again? Here's the exchange. Bear, I'm putting Badger through. Badger's your colonel. It suits him perfectly. Lola? What's this? A hidden treasure? - Leave it. It's the owner's. - And where is he? - He ran away. - So what do I care? Lola! Look at this! Tokay! Champagne! You were sitting on all this, you dummies? Whiskey... Dubonnet... Tokay from Prince Hohenlohe's cellar! Fry the potatoes! Poles and Hungarians are brothers! We'll drink it all! But our war... is colorful... ful...ful... Good wine. Waited 73 years for Mr. Gorkiewicz. Drink, Lola. I can't. I'm dizzy. You're a fine woman. - Why didn't I marry you? - Exactly. Why didn't you? I'm so dizzy. Who needs Zoska? I always miss out on the best things. Ibis calling. No... Use the finger. It's four a.m., Blueberry! Oh, God... It's four! Gentlemen! I gotta go! Kisses... Sit, doggie! Fan me, coz I'm hot. Just like that! Stay! Stay! Poor Downtown. Damn headache! Got so hammered on that stupid wine... We understand each other, right? What are you scared of? It's war. What will you do now, orphan? Your home's in ruins. And so is mine. Cut it out! Give me my bottle back! Wait... Follow me! Gentlemen insurgents! Gentlemen insurgents! I need to get to the Hungarians! Wait for me! Wait! Nurse! Nurse, do you have any pills? I've got a splitting headache! Excuse me... Total stupidity! Craziness! Shame to target such a talented man! Damn it! Don't shoot! Wife! Children! Mother! Warsaw! I'm going! Don't laugh! Don't laugh! I'm sick! Hey, lady! ls he your relative?! He told me to bring him to this address! God! Babyface! My dear! What's wrong? He's wounded! He's dead! My dearest Babyface! Say something! Move! - Damned head! - What's wrong with you? - Are you alive? - Stop talking! What's the time? - Two o'clock. Can you stand up? - Damn! Mister! What about my 5 rubles? My wife will pay you! - You're back at last. - And you're just watering flowers? Currants. I had to blend in. You got scratched by a cat? I wish it was a cat. I stepped into the middle of hell. Germans, cannons, tanks! God knows what else! Here's the letter. Your losses aren't that great, under the circumstances. Well? What does it say? So why did I get myself into all this? I should have stayed at home and kept an eye on my wife. Goodbye, sir. You're the only one who benefited from all this. Our cannons... - Damn! To blow such an opportunity! - I was so full of hope. Shit! The MPs! I'm taking this ride. - You're not going back? - The Germans took over! - It's hell out there now! - Our boys are fighting against the Germans there. But I'm not trying to convince you. - It's quite risky. - lstvan! - Long live Poland! - Their situation isn't any better. Zosia! The professor wants to say goodbye. What's this? - From lstvan. Family heirloom. - Sure. Just not his family. Let's treat it as partial compensation. - You're leaving us. - I must. Thank you for having me. See you... partner. Come, Babyface. We're alone at last. You deserve some rest after all these errands. Zosia will take care of you. Maybe our apartment will survive? What do you think? Where are you going, Babyface? Don't leave me alone here! Babyface! PART TWO OSTINATO - LUGUBRE Attention! At ease! - A prison camp. - A sanatorium. I was afraid they'd send us to a concentration camp. - Why is it so empty in here? - I have no idea. Gentlemen... You'll get a bath, new uniforms and you'll be searched. We know that in Warsaw you were paid in dollars. Better hand them over of your own accord. Now to the washroom. - Everyone immediately asks for dollars. - And you thought that they'd do what? Germans are a peculiar nation. They burn people in crematoria and here they organize festivals. The Geneva Convention. A different life. Oh, my! Look at that. - Gentlemen insurgents! - Welcome! How's it in Warsaw? They're coming. Welcome. - Lieutenant Marianek. - Szpakowski. Go ahead, please. - Marianek. - Kurzawa. This way, gentlemen. Come in, please. Let me welcome you on behalf of the team. - Lieutenant Korwin-Makowski. - Lieutenant Kurzawa. - 2nd Lieutenant Szpakowski. - 2nd Lieutenant Dabecki. Hello. Zak. Zak. My name's Krygier. Szpakowski. Turek! Wake up! We have new colleagues. TUREK IS SLEEPING HERE. DON'T WAKE UP. Hello. Hi. Turek. 2nd Lieutenant. - Hi. - Szpakowski. I feel sorry for you. No need. We're here to get some rest. These are your bunks. And now we invite you for a little treat. - Come, gentlemen. - Take your seats. - Help yourselves. - We've met before, lieutenant. Don't you remember? Officer cadet Kurzawa. You put me through quite a drill... I think... Yes, I remember. We last saw each other in 1939, on the last day of September. When the Germans chased us off to Skierniewice. - They released you from the camp? - No, I just took off, hid in some store. And at night, I returned to Warsaw. And you've been here all this time? That's not nice, lieutenant. Not only did you manage to avoid the camp, but you also managed to earn two stars since. A professional officer shall not forgive you for that. Well, I was lucky. And one can also escape from here. What's that? You're quite well-off here. Powdered coffee? Powdered coffee. Powdered milk. Powdered eggs. Powdered people, too. So in those last five years no one has escaped from here? Lieutenant Zawistowski did. You've inherited his bunk. How did he do it? No one knows. He just vanished. He was a great officer. Made of steel. - He's in the West by now. - Smart ass. He redeemed the camp's honor. He was a great colleague. With a strong personality. - And a righteous man. - The only one you could talk to. Such a loss. An officer in captivity is obliged to escape. - He was the only one... - I'd escape... Not because it's an officer's duty. I just can't stand it any more. I asked you not to talk to me, Lieutenant Zak. - You're not eating? - We already ate. It's for you. Thank you for the treat. Gentlemen, let's portion the margarine. Marianek, check the scales. - Can we begin? - Just a moment. OK. - Ready. Whose is it? - Krygier's. - And this one? - Dabecki's. Take it, gentlemen. There. More. - Good. - Whose? - Turek's. - Mr. Turek! Mr. Turek. Margarine! Can't you respect that the only real human being here is sleeping? You know I owe Krygier so the margarine goes to him. - Whose? - Lieutenant Zak's. Zak! Your margarine! Zak! This one. The other one. Why are you always so spiteful? Because I'm fed up with that foolery of yours. God! If only I could be alone. Wherever: in a loft, in a cellar, in a loo... - You're insulting us! - Leave him. He's unstable. Yes. I'm unstable. Why don't you escape like that Zawistowski guy? He's probably eating English beefsteaks now. Kurzawa! Remember the taste of beefsteaks? He's probably sitting alone in a room by the radio, - thinking where to go out at night. - Nonsense! He's probably fighting under Maczek or Anders's command. - Turek said, someone saw him in London. - Turek didn't say anything. A colleague of mine sent a message home that Zawistowski was seen in England. That's all I know. And please, don't mention my name. It keeps me awake. You think I wouldn't escape? The problem isn't getting through the wires but what to do next. Get through them, then. - I hate such idle talk. - I will. - Even tomorrow. - Wanna bet? - A thousand smokes. - Deal. - Maybe I'll finally get detention. - Stop it! Don't tempt fate. - The guard... - Let him shoot! Maybe I'll get out of here at last? Be by the fence tomorrow, after roll-call. Learn to walk in clogs! You must be surprised. Nothing ever surprises me. Don't bother. - Insomnia? - No. I sleep during the day. - Want some coffee? - No, thanks. - Will you drink it all by yourself? - Yes. That dervish doesn't count. He's asleep anyway. - I'm sorry. I won't disturb you. - Stay, please. You come... You come from the outside world. Well... Do you know what five years means? You see... In the first year, I was fascinated by the Alps. I used to draw Alps. Then I drew wires. Then I started drawing baboons for cigarettes. - Baboons? - Yeah. Higher rank officers. - Now, I do nothing. - Lieutenant, the Holy Mass is at six. Should I wake you? Maybe you know the service? - What? - Acolytes' service? Excuse me. I'm just resting here. Dervish, stop bothering a normal man. You went mad after three years. And he's only been here a day. Why aren't you asleep? You've dozed off, dervish! You pray day and night, but fall asleep at the most important moment. - I couldn't hear the footsteps. - Go to bed. I'm in my socks so as not to wake up anyone. I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee, lieutenant? Yes. You seem very decent. It's just the same. I have no choice but to trust you. What are you afraid of? The Germans find out different things. And we're talking about someone's life here. I'm not very talkative. Five years in the underground. If you think it's necessary, you can tell me. Both Marianek and I share food with him. No one else knows about it. He is hungry and seems ill. - Are you a professional officer? - No, I'm not. I was in college, when the war broke out. Good. I don't need to ask you for the officer's word of honor. - I don't follow. - Haven't you figured it out yet? This is the only man who's ever escaped. The one gobbling on beefsteaks, and fighting bravely in the West. Lieutenant Zawistowski. He's up there. The Gestapo came looking for him. He has to remain in hiding. The forest was here, the cannon was over there. They started shooting from the village. You were sitting ducks. - We were in the vanguard... - You should've remained on the edge of the forest. A cavalry's charge would've swept the tanks away. But we were firing. - What's that about? - September 1939. - Who remembers that? - Didn't you fight in the Campaign? - I was 15. - And now you're an officer. - Promoted during the war. - These promotions shall be verified. We start "Basic" tomorrow. - We've appointed you, lieutenant. - What the hell is "Basic"? Military training. Tactics. You take a "Basic English" textbook as a cover. - Not a word to anyone. - Thank you... - for considering me. - You're refusing? - An officer's duty in captivity... - I know, but I don't dream of having a military career. I don't think there'll be any more wars. - How much is a dollar? - 40 smokes, I guess. - What about bread? - They say 200 smokes. I don't know. - 5 bucks for bread? - I don't know. If it's too much for you, get beans. You'll have more, when they swell. Go ask Krygier. I don't know. Officers! Cut it out, Mr. Zak. Be reasonable. - I'll stand. - Do you have any complaints? - No. - Go back. No, thank you. Your number? - What's he doing? - He wants to get detention. It's the only place in the camp where he can be alone. The wait to get there is several weeks. Officers! Fall out! What about a couple of rounds? I do 15 after roll-call. No. I'm going to the infirmary to get some cough medicine. - You have no honor! - Don't teach me about honor! - Step off! - People know who you are! - Nobody knows you, that's worse! - I'll take you to officer's court! - Don't even try! - We'll settle it here, then! Fool! They're a disgrace to the Polish uniform. It's an American uniform. From World War I. Officers! Stop that! It's the general's order! Your general can kiss my ass! A prisoner! Halt! Halt! Halt! Halt! - He's won, smart ass! - I'll gladly give him the smokes. - It's impossible to escape from here. - What about Zawistowski? You'd have to be Zawistowski. - You should attend "Basic". - What do I need tactics for? It may be useful. - Are you thinking about a new war? - Yes. You haven't been to Poland in a long time. It's not all roses between Germany and Russia. This war hasn't ended yet. Once I leave this camp I shall get rid of this uniform. No one's gonna force me to put the green back on. This is our side of the table, lieutenant. Is Zak back? No, he's not. Officers came to congratulate him on his feat. - Which officers? - Even General Baczynski sent his man. We've decided to reconsider our attitude towards Lieutenant Zak. Yesterday he redeemed himself as an officer. So both Lieutenant Dabecki and I decided to withdraw our complaints from the officer's court of honor. He got captured by two country broads. An officer cannot be expected to struggle with women. Considering the circumstances, Lieutenant Zak achieved a lot. He laughed at the enemy's face. Of course, his jest can't be compared to Lieutenant Zawistowski's heroic escape. But he did make a name for himself in the history of our camp. Kurzawa! Parcels are supposed to arrive tomorrow. It'll be intense. I'll eat everything at one sitting. Wanna bet? You don't know me. What's the bet? If you eat what's in your parcel within 2 hours, I'll give you another one. If you don't, you'll give me the next one you'll get. - Deal? - Deal. - I'd eat a horse! You'll lose again. - We'll see. Lieutenant Zak! On behalf of my colleagues... There's no chance of getting detention. They put me up with you again. - They know how to punish me. - Your win. Here you are. Thank you. Donate them to Lieutenant Zawistowski's fund. For the officers who intend to escape. - A thousand cigarettes? Are you nuts? - I don't want them. But it'd get you 12 cans of coffee! 36 loaves of bread! Take it, dammit! I know that none of you will try to escape. Zawistowski was the only one. Whoever wants the cigarettes can have them. Just no drawing, please! 999 left. Lieutenant Zak! Your extravagance is an insult to the honor of the team! Lieutenant Dabecki and I can't let it off! Don't bother. Lieutenant Zak has neglected the summons of the court of honor three times already. I leave you with the cigarettes. How about donating them to the chapel. They're not to be touched. Lieutenant Krygier will be in charge of them. He won them and didn't want them. It's his call. From above you look like a bunch of apes. Is this the whole supper? - I haven't had an appetite in a year. - You'll starve yourself to death. - I'm really tired after that fight. - It was very well played. They're even comparing it to Zawistowski's escape. You may go now. It'll be a real feast for him. I'll knock for you. Be careful, Marianek. Today's a turbulent day. If we got Krygier in on it, we'd have lots of food for Zawistowski. I don't trust tradesmen. They care about their own business too much. They say the same about artists. Marianek! Get up there! Lieutenant Kurzawa? I'm Zawistowski. I've brought you some cough medicine. And sleeping pills. It's cold up here. It was worse in the summer. I thought I'd fry. Now I have blankets. Darkness is the worst thing. I haven't seen a man's face for 6 months. - Wanna smoke? - Don't. There's a skylight up here. I learnt not to smoke. A man doesn't need much to live. Loneliness is the worst. Does anyone suspect that I'm hiding up here? - No. - Even Zak? He was my best friend. - I don't want him to know. - They think you're a hero. Did you know I walk on all fours up here? Two steps across, four along. Maybe that's better. I have no strength. I can't sleep. I've started talking to myself. Those pills will make you sleep. Take them. They could hear you cough. What if they did? I'm a burden for you. - What's new at the front lines? - Nothing but local fighting. It's a pity you have to go. Turek gives me food on a stick. I know it's safer. Tomorrow, I'll get you chocolate, peanuts, margarine and meat. God. It costs a fortune. We got a parcel. A thousand smokes. I'm off. Take care. Want some coffee? It's good he's there. It keeps me alive. He keeps you alive? I'm glad you've accepted my invitation. Thank you and enjoy. Awkward situation. And you, officers, say nothing. You take the insult from that... Gentlemen! Can't sleep because of your endless quarrels. The cigarettes belonged to no one. They were abandoned property. It's been 5 years and no one has ever been stealing! - Don't you call us thieves. - You may demand satisfaction. - Up yours with that satisfaction! - Calm down, gentlemen! - Kurzawa! - Yes? A parcel. Shall we weigh it? Take your half, coz I'll start eating right away. Lieutenant Szpakowski! Do you know what happened to the cigarettes? Maybe Mr. Turek smoked them all at night? And you, Lieutenant Kurzawa? - I think I saw you get up last night. - You didn't sleep either. Since Zawistowski's escape the atmosphere here has become unbearable! If the cigarettes aren't returned by noon, Lieutenant Dabecki and I are leaving this block. Alarm again. No walking today. - Do you stick to the bet, lieutenant? - I do. - I'll fill my stomach at your expense. - We'll see. - What cigarettes are these? - Chesterfields. L got om Golds. What about the jam? Strawberry. I got peanut butter. Who needs strawberries? Bug off, mister. Scientific approach is what matters. Sweet with sweet... and fat with fat. - That's all. - Good. I won't eat the cigarettes or soap. I agree. You're witnesses, gentlemen. It's a couple of minutes past nine. Let's say you have time till noon. Fine. They're flying- Mr. Zak! Don't stand in the window! If the guard sees you, he'll shoot you. One down. How are you, Mr. K? I have time. I'll wait. What? What? I'll rest for a moment. Can't you be quiet? - Silence! - Don't like it? Just leave! - Three more spoonfuls to go. - He'll keep on eating... One more spoonful, please. Be good... That's it. What? One nil, gentlemen! That last one got him! Gentlemen! Where's Zak? Zak! - Stop! - Alarm! Zak! Zak! Zak! Switch it off! Don't you hear me? Do you still want to move? Yes, we do. - Hello, gentlemen. - Hi. - Can I move in now? - In a moment. - You have two places to choose from. - Three. I prefer the top one. Forgive me, I haven't introduced myself. - Doctor Kaliszewski. - Lieutenant Korwin-Makowski. Dabecki. Excuse me, are you a physician? - Doctor of philosophy. - It's a pity. Was Lieutenant Zawistowski in your team? Yes, he was. - Is this place going to be free, too? - It's free. - You'll take the light bulb? - No, we won't. Great. I'll be able to work at night. I'm going to get my stuff. I hope we will get on well. The pills must have helped him. He hasn't coughed once since roll-call. He's dead. My God! Are you sure? I've seen my share of dead men over the last few years. Will we ever live like human beings again? - My life will forever be like a camp. - That's because you reject faith. Pray for the one who rests six feet above us. We can't just leave him up there. I'll go to the warden. - I once painted him with all his medals on. - Aren't you afraid? No. I'm protected by the Geneva Convention. I'm off to the infirmary anyway. I don't care anymore. And so dies the legend of Lieutenant Zawistowski. I'll do my best to not let it happen. It must be done for him. - And for them. - You aren't that cynical after all. This way. Please. - This block? - Yes, sir. It's SS. That's why the orderly officers weren't allowed to stay in. They could've chosen a warmer day. What are they looking for? Hey! They're starting with our block. God! My manuscript. Someone must've snitched on the distillery in the first room. Look! Our boiler! Maybe they'll fix the shower? Just like a funeral. In a boiler like that you can get through the gate, - bribe the driver and the escorts... - Give it a rest. No one can escape this camp. - What about Zawistowski. - Right... Zawistowski... Officers! Fall out! THE END
