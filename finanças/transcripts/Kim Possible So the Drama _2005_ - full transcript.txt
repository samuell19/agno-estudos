- It is impossible. - No, but real close. Ron! Ron? Working on it. Oh. Thanks. A Sumo Ninja? I am strong like the mountain! That is sick and wrong! I am your doom. Rufus, help! [yawns] Naked mole rat. Weird enough for ya? You will suffer! Kim! Just a sec. Ron! That move won the cheer regionals. Oooh! Better get some ice on that, champ. Gotcha! Right behind ya, KP. Oh, man! I did not put on my rocket-skates this morning. I put on my blaster-briefs! [beeps] - Hey, Wade, what's the sitch? - Is this a bad time? Remember the President of Nakasumi Toys thought he was in danger? - Yeah. - He was right. Hang on. [Wade] Got you on GPS lock. Kim! U-turn! Monique wanted me to patch her through. - But you seem kinda busy. - Kinda. It was something about Bonnie and Brick. What? Put her through. - Like, now. - Okay, okay. - Monique, off or on? - On, again! How many times can two people break up and get back together? - She loves the drama. - She needs a date for the prom. - Oh, this is bad. - They deserve each other. No, I mean this is bad. Gotta go. Thanks, Ron. - Shego! - Oh, look. The sidekick. Gotcha, toy man. [cheering] Boo-ya! You know, one day, we really need to get that hairdryer from her. â™ª Doesn't matter where â™ª â™ª Doesn't matter when â™ª â™ª I will always be there â™ª â™ª Till the very end â™ª - â™ª Call me â™ª - â™ª Call me â™ª - â™ª Beep me â™ª - â™ª Beep me â™ª â™ª Call me Beep me â™ª â™ª If you wanna reach me â™ª â™ª Call me, beep me If you wanna reach me â™ªâ™ª - Sitch, Wade? - Digging on Drakken-Nakasumi but so far nothing. - I can't figure it. - Yeah. I get why he'd take Nakasumi's automated toy-making technology, - not why he'd take him. - Right. I was talking about this geometry homework. - Want me to take a look? - Nah. Super-genius assistance is pretty cheatish. I'll ask Ron. - Any luck on Number 7? - Mmm. Very tricky. Ron? Number 7 is very tricky. I plan to come back to that one. How is that essay going? I believe Stoppable-san will be pleased. Where exactly is Stoppable-san? Ron? [speaks Japanese] Miss Possible, welcome. And thank you once again. No big. Thanks for the lift back home. Have you seen Ron? Rufus, I'm supposed to steer. Come on! [horn beeps] [beeps] - Ron. - Talk to the naked driver. [Japanese] Nakasumi-san says not to worry. His business is to create joy. Your friend is an excellent customer, still filled with childlike wonder. - Maybe a little too much. - No way! Is this what I think it is?! Tiki-Boo rules! Bun-Bun! Do you create these characters yourself, Mr. Nakasumi? Yes, he does. It is his personal touch. Oh, come on. You just doodle a face on, and boom, every kid on the planet wants one. Do not tell the shareholders it is so easy. They might take away my jet. Ah, I hear you, dude. - Wait, you speak English? - Quite fluently. But enjoy whispering to Miss Kyoko. Nakasumi-san is a little, would you say, whacky? Okay. I guess it goes with the whole toymaker thing? Stoppable-san, on behalf of the Nakasumi Corporation, accept our gratitude for your efforts in the rescue of Nakasumi-san. Who works extremely hard on the whole toy thing, you know, by the way. Nakasumi-san, we approach Middleton Airport. The pilot should have landing clearance shortly. That's okay, just drop us off here. It's go time! - Oh! My homework! - Serves you right! Good morning, Dr. Possible. And to you, Dr. Possible. Crazy. Three procedures before lunch. You? Down to the wire on the Hephaestus Project. Three years, $3 billion. - Boy, I hope this works. - More coffee? [computer] Are you sure you wish to delete File Hephaestus? - Yes. - [computer] Dr. Possible voice print acknowledged. Deleting file now. No, no, no! Undo! Undo! File delete aborted. - No worries, got it all here. - Kids eaten? Jim and Tim are working on some top-secret invention. - Like father, like sons. - Haven't seen Kimmie. Morning. Got in a little late there, Kimmie cub. Yeah, it really slows me down when I pull my shoot as soon as we bail, but Ron is such a baby about free falling. Where exactly were you last night? [TV] The Tokyo toy magnate was rescued by world-famous teen hero Kim Possible. - That's my girl. - It was no big, Dad. Other than a Sumo Ninja. He was pretty big. Sumo Ninja... I never worried about Sumo Ninjas at your age. Or Sumo anythings, for that matter. - Sweet backhand. - Not yet, Dad. - Tweebs! - Mom! Dad! Did you see our... You did this. Why can't you play with video games like normal kids? - We do. - We use them for parts. - It's true. - No missiles, boys. - [both] Fine. - This is what happens when a rocket scientist and a brain surgeon reproduce. Brain-tap machine ready for prisoner. There is no prisoner. Go tap yourself. [Drakken] You have failed me for the last time, Shego. The Syntho-Drones are improving. They might actually win a fair fight. Too bad that's not my style. Syntho-Drone 842 will terminate operations. 843. Shego, must you always break my toys? Okay, sport. Why are you all, "You have failed me for the last time!" Are you kidding me with that? No, the time has come to take our game to the next level. Oh, I was especially fond of Number 842. He had a certain spring in his step and a sparkle in his eye. No, I think that's syntho-goo. Can we get a mop in here? Walk with me, talk with me. Would you say that I'm evil? Oy, not this again. - Please, be honest. - Yes, you're very evil. Ah, Henderson! Crucial to the mutant life form project. Oh, I suppose you're right. Dr. D, get a grip. I mean, nobody does super-weapons like you. Just look at that Annihilation Ray. Evil by design. And energy efficient! See? There you go. The things I'm doing in the field of torture are very exciting. That's what I'm saying. You have definitely... lost it. My latest research project. Teenage wasteland. I will get inside her high-school head. I will know Kim Possible's fatal flaw. Stevens, progress report. What up, Dr. D-Diggity-Dawg? We've lost Stevens. - Excuse me, Dr. Drakken. - What?! Without a brain to tap, the brain-tap machine is not used to its fullest extent. Give me that! - Wha-hoo-hoo-hoo! - What are you so happy about? Oh, nothing. Just the first step to world conquest. Whatever. - Let me see that! - Shego! A doodle?! You are so whacked. Fo shizzle, Shegizzle. Oh, no. Are you trying to be hep again? - Word to your mother! - Ohh! Go, Mad Dogs! [ringtone] That was so on purpose. Like, it's always about you. Zero your ego, Kim. Brick, I'll come over when you're done working out. Two hours? Okay. Oh, and don't shower. I like it when you glisten. When you glisten?! Could you be any sicker? Oh, like you and your BF? Woops! I forgot, you don't have a BF, do you, Kim? Too busy saving the world? You still use air quotes, huh? Interesting. I'm all about Brick Flagg. Hottie? Top of the food chain. Tara's with Jason, the basketball team's star forward. Jessica's with the baseball captain. Soccer, track and field, lacrosse, ice-hockey. Face facts. All the remotely acceptable guys are taken. Is there a deadline I don't know about? - The prom? - It's just another dance. Try the dance. Who you go with is, like, crucial. You're looking at captain of the chess team. - Hey, KP! - Or worse. [Ron] Do we have a date with Bueno Nacho or what? [Monique] Girl, that is flawed. I know but what if Bonnie has, in her own stupid way, a point. - Shock! - What if there is something wrong with me? - 'Cause you're not dating a quarterback? - I'm weirding guys out! They see me on TV, roundhousing some goon out of a window. It's a vivid image. Kim, you are a strong, independent woman. Anybody afraid of that is not worth your time. Yeah, maybe, but what if she's right? Is there anything sadder than going to the prom with "just a friend"? And his naked mole rat. Four nacos, three quesoritos and a tortada salad. - Extra cheese on that. - SÃ­. - That'll be $7.52. - [Ron] Check your math. This is my standard Naco Night order. Always comes to $4.98. I'm sorry, the Naco Night promotion has been canceled. - Y-You canceled Naco Night? - I don't have that kinda power. - New management. - What new management? Somebody bought the whole enchilada. I can give you the 800 number if you'd like to express a concern. Oh, yeah. I got some concerns. I mean, a "date" date would be nice, but a stinkin' BF... - You've let Bonnie play you. - Have not! What good is saving the world if you don't have someone to share it with? Okay, a little. Just once, I'd like to make her eat her words. - They are low-carb. - KP. Life as we know it has changed forever. Naco Night is no more. - And I need three more bucks. - What up, Wade? Drakken's been spotted. The Bermuda Triangle. â™ª I'm searching for someone â™ª â™ª I know I can trust â™ªâ™ª All right, Shego, I'm off to grill this common criminal. - What's his name again? - Big Daddy Brotherson. - But you should know... - Please! I am a super-genius. I think I can handle Big Daddy. - Do you think there'll be a long line? - Shh! Hi, undercover. What? It was my dad's, he bought it for his prom. Never been worn. Big Daddy? Dr. Drakken. I understand... Ah-ah-ah. - The password. - Password? What password? [Drakken] Aaah! Didn't have the password? You might have mentioned the password. Thought a genius would figure it out. Shego, I am not a particularly patient man. Okay, wet blanket. The password is... Neenenner. Sit down. Whoa! The ladies' room. Good. Laser lipstick. Sweet. How come Wade never makes me cool toys? You practically melted your fingers. It looked like regular nail polish. Ladies' room, Ron. [Ron] Hold on. How do? You, uh, The Kid? Yes. Yes, I am. I have the cash. Do you have the information? - Put the money on the table. - Put the information on the table. You go first. Look, I don't have time for silly games. He likes to play silly games, FYI. [grumbles] Wade, I'm in. Any sign of Drakken? - Not that I can see. - Shego? Turn around! There you go, Kid. Five million fresh cow chips. These are mine? I mean, yes. Good. Yes, my money. Miss me, boys? - Well, that's a bold move. - Was it? - You're good for this? - Am I? Hey, you know the tells when a man is bluffing? Like when he won't look you in the eye. Or maybe he touches his face. His breathing gets shallow and wheezy. [breathes wheezily] Three cowboys. Um... Go fish? Okay, good game. Let's not wait so long next time... Whoa! I don't think you should stray till you back up these chips with your cash money, Kid. I'm... going... for... a... I... Yah! KP! Yo! The Kid is in the house. Let's get this party started. Aaaah! Sorry, can I just... Aaaah! Ah-ha! Now, with this top-secret code, "Milk... bread... eggs?" - What kind of code is that? - My grocery list. You are quite poor at the trading game. Shego! Very well. I've had my fun. Well. I'm glad you've had your fun. Now, where can I find the cybertronic technology I need? Ah, cybertronics. The most brilliant minds on the planet struggle with its challenges. Surely someone has cracked it? Indeed, one genius has done just that. Hm? Dr. James Timothy Possible. Ooh, irony. And it's in my favor this time. Where's Drakken and what's he up to? Yeah, as if I can understand his whacked plans. - Please! - Shego. Time to fly. Next time, Princess. [beep] You think you're all that but you're not even close! This is so annoying. Brick, you are gonna look so good in your tux. - KP! - Hey, Ron. Got great news. Naco Night will be coming back. Really? Great. Nothing's for sure, but when they see this. A piece of paper with your name on it. It's a petition. - Probably need more signatures. - Probably. When we hit Bueno Nacho, I'll work the room, drum up support. We'll beat this thing. - Actually, Ron, I'm, uh... - What? - Just gonna head home. - Oh, uh, okay. Cool. See ya. KP, um... - I know what this is about. - You do? It's because I messed up and helped Drakken and Shego get away. Oh, no. I'm used to that. I mean, you know, we'll get 'em. - Thanks. - No big. Wrong. Very big. - I can always count on you. - Right. - Dad, can we talk? - Sure, Kimmie cub. Hold on. Okay, shoot. You have my undivided attention. It's about... boys. Ah... Oh... Mmm... Boys and dating. Ah-ha. Hi, honey. Got a minute? Kimmie needs to talk to you. - It's your mother. - Mom? Bonnie's with Brick, so she's all high horse, all boys, and the prom and the food chain, and I'm gonna end up with Ron! [Mom] I don't see the crisis, honey. He's a very nice guy. Mom, he's not a guy, he's Ron. [Mom] So as a friend he's okay? Well, yeah. He's my best friend. - [Mom] Not boyfriend material? - Obviously. [Mom] Because of the food chain. No. Yes. Well, kind of. The person you go with, it makes a statement. [man] My son doesn't have a date. [Mom] Kevin doesn't have a date. Mom, you don't have me on speaker again, do you? - [all] Hi, Kim! - Mom! Honey, hands free is really the only way to go. Seriously, Kim. Kevin's a super kid. The others on the chess team look up to him. Oh, yes, Dr. Gooberman. Kevin's got game. [beep] Hmm. Better hop off. - We'll talk later. - [man] I can have Kev call... Monique, you were totally right. I know... What was I right about? The Bonnie problem. Non issue. Who cares about the food chain? - Ron and I are cool. - Stand by your Ron. I mean he's... ...full of childlike wonder. When it's just me and my machine scorching across the blacktop, I kinda lose myself. - Hey! - See you at school. - [Monique] Later, Ron. - Keep it real. Huh? Do you mind? Dude! Do you mind?! - What? - Spot! Mine. You in it. Oh! Dude. Man, I'm sorry. I didn't even see you. This might sound weird but when it's just me and my machine... And the blacktop. Yes! I know exactly what you're talking about. I'm Ron. Ron Stoppable. Hey, I'm Erik. [Rufus squeals] - Wow. Is that a naked mole rat? - Yeah! Most people don't get that. They think Rufus is a bald hamster. I always wanted a naked mole rat. Me too, which is good, because I, you know, have one. What's your name again? Erik, compadre, you don't know how lucky you are you ran into Ron Stoppable. I know everything about everything round here. Great. Where do I pick up my class assignments? Yeah. I'm not a nuts-and-bolts guy, I'm more big picture. The cafeteria, where I'm told you can find a nutritious meal. I haven't yet, but your mileage may vary. - Who's that? - Cafeteria lady. Trust me, you cannot get her fired. No, the girl. - Kim. Kim Possible. - Weird name. You've never heard of Kim Possible? She frequently saves the world. I help. Almost as frequently. - So you know her? - Yeah, we're tight. - Hooked up? - Ew. Kim and me? No, no, no. We've been best friends since forever. But not like that. She's... Extreme steam. Okay, you know what? Let's not talk about her that way ever again. Okay? Okay. Whatever's clever. Wild mushroom risotto with cracked pepper and parmesan. And please don't skimp on the truffle oil. Hey, Ron. Hi. Pull up a chair, why don't you... Isn't that interesting? Actually, that's my chair. Not that my name's on it, but... Hey, Erik. How you doing? Girl, I just went from so to whoa! Huh? It takes a while to learn Monique speak. - How about you? - What about me? Ha, ha! Yeah... Kim is such a kidder. Did I mention we'd known each other since pre-k? Good times. Good times. I feel as though a loop has just been formed and I'm not in it. â™ª We're the best of friends â™ª â™ª And we share our secrets â™ª â™ª She knows everything â™ª â™ª That is on my mind â™ª â™ª Why don't you kiss her â™ª â™ª Why don't you tell her â™ª â™ª Why don't you let her see the feelings that you hide â™ª â™ª She'll never know â™ª â™ª If you never show â™ª â™ª The way you feel inside â™ªâ™ª Attention please! We detect cooties in the area. - Repeat. Cooties in the area. - This can only mean one thing. Kim's got a boyfriend! - Pigtails. Nice! - Shut up! - Thanks for having me over. - No big. But so sweet. - [retches] - Euch. Got that right. Who wants what on the pizza? - [both] Pepperoni. - Jinx. - You owe me a soda. - Very cute. Get in line. She owes me a soda from before she even met you. No soda for you. Hmmm. [phone rings] - Yeah? - Hi, honey. Pizza night. - Bacon? - Roger on that, hon. Okay, I'll try not to be too late. Love you. Come on. Daddy needs to see some cybertronic replication. Oh! Outstanding! The Hephaestus Project is a go! Who's the man? I'm the man. The man who wants the Hephaestus Project! Ron? Actually, Dr. P, I've got the... - Uh...belly-flips. - Got my endoscope in the car. I'm kidding! Why don't you stay? - Well... - [both] Later, Ron! - Jinx. - Again? Man! Cootie alert! He's always been prone to drama, I guess. He's fine. Dad's pizza's getting cold. - Cool! Can we heat it up? - No. The fire department said no more fusion experiments. Where is your father? My teenage daughter is not afraid of you. Why should I be, Drew? I hate it when you call me that! I am not the man you knew in college, Possible. Still can't get a date, though, I bet. Why is it every Possible I capture feels the need to give me lip? Doesn't anyone respect the traditional captive-captor relationship any more? Has society just gone completely to seed?! If I could interrupt your rant to point out that I'm not telling you anything about the project. Oh, I anticipated that. You know what they say. If you want to make an omelet, you've gotta break a few eggheads. [bones crack] Okay, hold the phone, here. [computer] Do you wish to delete File Hephaestus? - No! - Yes. [computer] Dr. Possible voice print acknowledged. You deleted it. Are you mad? No worries. Got it all up here. Well, good news then, because I have a brain-tap machine and I've been just dying to use it. [pager beeps] - Dude, your clip-on tie. - Clipped off. - But you're assistant manager. - Not any more. - Lars is in charge. - Lars? Home office sent him. Change is in the air. Serious change. Kiddy meals. - With toys in them? - Affirmative. Wait, I don't get... What's wrong with that? Imagine the brat factor. Next they'll add a playground. And then what? - A spokesclown? - Really? What would that pay? [beeps and buzzes] [Ron] Kim? 911! Drakken has my dad. I don't like this. It feels too... - Trappish? - Not a word, but yes. Kim Possible and her sidekick, whose name escapes me. After all our battles, how can he not know my name? Miss Possible, you would do well to save your energy. Your father is in quite a pickle. Dad! I must warn you, my latest death ray is killer. Isn't that redundant? KP! I wish I could be there but I'm busy settling into my new lair, the lair from which I shall take over the world. Farewell, Kim Possible. Farewell... What's his name again? Whatever, you know who you are. I mean, come on, it's really not a hard name to remember. - Ron... - Yes, thank you. Hey! Syntho-Drones. Gross! I'll have you out of there in no time. - Ronald! - What? - Look out. - Oww! Oww! Oww! Ron, quit fooling around. Oww! Oww! Oww! Thanks, Rufus. Kim! [punches] - Dad, are you okay? - Yep. Least, I think so. What exactly did Drakken do to you? I... I have no idea. He captured you in your lab, right? Did he? I don't remember. I remember wanting bacon on my pizza. Then nothing. - Come on, better get you home. - Which is where? You saved your dad?! - So not the drama. - You know what this means. - You got it goin' on. - I do? Yeah! You can never be grounded, girl. Why did evil dude pull the dad-napping anyway? To play me, I guess. Something's off the road, here, though. Usually, I can crack Drakken's sicko plots no prob. This time, it's all so random. I want something that says, "This girl is too fine for you, baby boy." You think I can pull this off? Pull it off and throw it away! Euch! Maybe I should just raid my closet. Not for the prom. You're gonna be Kimderella. - Kim, hey. - Hey. - You should buy that dress. - I should? Yeah. And I know I've only gone to Middleton for five minutes, but, about this prom... Have you met Ron Stoppable? Kim and Ron are, like, inseparable. Is that Brick out there, hitting on the girl in Earring World? He's hypnotized by her big hoops! [alarm rings] What's the sitch? What? What? - Dude... - XYZ? Wanna go get a bite? Hey, it's pretty weird to just run into you here, isn't it? [Shego] What is he up to? Toy design, top secret cybertronic technology, Syntho-Drone personality and performance upgrades, and teen-zine junk? What is he gonna do? Throw the world's weirdest pajama party? You really haven't figured it out, have you? There is no plan here, no way. Oh, but there is! Spill! - No. - Why not?! Kim Possible is not smarter than you. True. If you can't figure it out, she can't figure it out. And that means... - You just might win. - Oh, I'm quite confident. If you'll excuse me, I'm due at a board of directors meeting. You? At what company? The one I recently acquired in a hostile takeover. That is my character. [excited shouts] [excited shouts] That is my character! [French accordion music] [didgeridoo] [pipe music] [crying] I'm here at Bueno Nacho, the home of Little Diablo. This tiny toy, this mini must- have, this cute little devil, is the latest craze for kids all over the world. Just one look around tells you that Little Diablo... I can't even get to the counter to order! This used to be my place, mine! I'm losing everything I ever cared about! - Ron's on TV. - And he's freaking out. Honey, I think the boys are right. Hmm. Ronald? Freaking? Oh, so he is. - Can we go to Bueno Nacho? - Please? I'm losing everything I ever cared about! - I'd better talk to him. - He's in the old tree house. I have a lethal weapon! Put the slingshot down, Huck Finn. It's me. Oh, I always wanted to use this on somebody. You did once, don't you remember? - Arnie Custer? - Arnie Custer. I was trying to stop him from hurting you. I pulled him off you because you beaned him with the slingshot. We were six, okay? The details are sketchy. I never noticed that sign before. Really? It's been up there forever. Oh, it was fun! When we were kids, I mean. Yeah, just the two of us. Hey, I remember this. Ron the happy camper. Camp Wannaweep. The worst summer of my life. I know, I know. The ticks, the poison ivy, the toxic lake, your mom stopped accepting your phone calls. Yeah, all that stuff was bad, but you know what was worse? Spending a whole summer away from you. You want any? I only do "to go" now. Little Diablo's ruined everything. Maybe something more than Bueno Nacho is bothering you. Talking about Erik, why... No! Why would I have a problem with Erik? No! I'm down with Erik. [wheezes] Erik's not gonna change what we're all about. - We'll always be tight. - Yeah. - Pretty words, Kim. - We're not in pre-k any more. - Time to grow up. - Maybe I don't wanna grow up. - If that means... - [Erik] Kim? - He can't come up here. - Ron! He really can't come up. This tree house has a weight limit. While I'm holding the slingshot we're already pushing it. We'll talk tomorrow. I'm not jealous. - You think Ron's okay with us? - Us what? - You know. Us. - Oh, that us. I think he's okay. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. This thing you do, the missions. How... What... It's just... - It's kind of... - Weird? - No, cool. - Oh. Yeah! - Wanna know what my mission is? - Okay, what? - To take you to the prom. - O... kay... I don't know. It's not like Kim hasn't dated other guys before. - True. - I mean, hey, I was the one she called when she and Walter locked braces. I got my mom to drive them to the orthodontist. I'm like... Rufus! And the whole Josh Mankey thing. I was never in favor of that. But I was there for Kim. - Ta-da! - Uh-huh. Yeah, very funny. - Okay, okay. - Something's different now. There's something between us. Who am I kidding? That's not different. Something's been there a long time. I think there's something there. Does she? Ah, thanks, buddy. I'm ready. Not just for the dance, either. But to do what no man should ever have to do. Talk about his feelings. I know, it's humiliating. But Kim's worth it. What if she likes this Erik guy and I show up yapping about my feelings and she wants Erik, not me... We're talking total flame-out! Oh, man, not to mention what it would do to our friendship. [Rufus] Oh... Help! Kimmie! There's a very handsome young man here for you. Let's get a few things clear up front. You read my mind, sir. Kim explained that her normal curfew is 10pm but on special occasions and rescue missions, you extend that to 11. I'd feel better if we stick with 10. Really? This young man has got it goin' on! - Why don't you get the camera? - Okie-doke. Comin' through! You tweebs! - Good reflexes. - Thank you, sir. Is it just me, or is he perfect? He seems very nice. Aren't your folks gonna stop by, get a few shots? It's just my dad and he's always at work. He's in the middle of some big-time project. Oh, I know that story. I know, I'll get double prints. Cool. [â™ª Jesse McCartney: Get Your Shine On] â™ª Everybody here's feelin' your vibe â™ª â™ª Eyes glued, hands up You're doin' it right â™ª â™ª Everybody gets their chance to shine â™ª â™ª So don't be shy now â™ª â™ª Don't you know everyone's a star â™ª â™ª Big time, it don't matter who you are â™ª â™ª Flip the beat and we're switchin' it up â™ª â™ª It's your time to... â™ª Possible and the new guy got the funk. - Oh, shut up! - Okay. â™ª Get your shine on â™ªâ™ª Welcome to Bueno Nacho. May I take your order? - Ron, something's very wrong! - Got that right. Let's see. Two chimiritos, grande sized. Three orders of nacos and a grande-sized soda to go. Make it for here. Rufus can't wait. SÃ­. Snap out of it. Something weird's going on here. Ned, you worthless slug. Did you ask our favorite customer if he would like Diablo sauce with that? I did not, sir. Diablo? Huh? Yeah, sure. Whatever. And here it is, nice and hot. Gracias. And have a muy bueno day. [screams and gibbers] No, it can't be! No! This is the last straw! - I beg your pardon? - This is the last straw! We have more in the back. You took away the bendy straws. You, sir, have lost it. - Just because I care? - About bendy straws. - I'm telling on you. - Telling who? Your boss. - Hello? - Wade, it's me. I'm at Bueno Nacho and I've got comments and concerns. Okay, want me to patch you through to the 800 number? No way, I want to go right to the top. Have words with the head honcho. I don't know, Ron. Getting through to a CEO is not easy. This guy's private line is probably super top secret. Got it. You're in. [phone rings] Hola, Bueno Nacho. El Presidente speaking. Dr. Drakken?! [Drakken] If this is about switching my... Dr. Drakken is a very busy man, Mr. Stoppable. There is no need to bother him. [Ned and Rufus scream] Huh? [Ned screams] Diablos, attack! [Ron whimpers] Hey, cut it out! [throttle squeaks] [Ron] Come on! [engine roars] [chugs weakly] This thing is junk! Am I the only one to notice? [dance music] [beeping] What? Maybe you oughta let it go to voice mail? - What if it's important? - More important than... Erik, hi! Hey, Monique. - I think Wade would understand. - Yeah. Oh, man! The Diablo toys are evil! They're... Where... What?! Where are they? - Are you okay, dude? - I know that tone. That's the "Ron's making up the whole thing" tone. You know what? It doesn't matter what you or anybody else thinks. Because my best friend will believe me, right, Kim? Oh, I, uh... Totally believe you. - The toys were here. - And they were evil. Um, right. Sure. - Buckle up, it gets weirder. - I'll bet. Drakken is behind the whole thing. The take-over-the-world mad scientist? Yes! It's all so obvious. Use the more than 30,000 Bueno Nacho locations worldwide to give out his evil prizes. - I'm going to check this out. - What? - Ron might be onto something. - His story is ridiculous. - Erik... - Back off, pretty boy. - It was definitely Drakken? - Voice match confirms it. Got anything on Ron's evil toy theory? - Yeah, looks bad. - How bad? All bad. I scanned the one I got in my lil' niÃ±os meal. The circuitry is beyond anything I've ever seen. It's like a real robot, only tiny. - Better show it to an expert. - Who? My dad. Be back as fast as I can. - But... - It's a save-the-world thing. - [Dad] I do not believe it! - What? - They're totally evil, right? - Cybertronic technology. It's the Hephaestus Project. He used my invention to build these things. For an evil genius, Drakken is pretty stupid. He steals a $3 billion super-secret technology and gives it away with a burrito? And yet he ditches the bendy straws? The man does not know how to run a fast-food business. [squeak] [whistles] Shego! Status report. - [Shego] It's a mixed bag. - What?! On the positive side, global saturation is at optimum level. - We can strike at midnight. - [Drakken] But...? Well, there's a snag. - Kim Possible! - How'd you guess? No, not this time. [Drakken] We strike at midnight as planned. But I want Middleton online now. Oh, and Shego. I need you to run out and pick up something for me. How'd it go there? That Drakken fellow stole my technology to make those little Diablos. We're playing with stolen technology. - Cool! - The craze is off the chain. Every kid on the planet must have one. Dad, you said the Hephaestus Project, it was some kind of living metal? That's how we sold it to the board of directors. The cybertronic circuitry can repair itself, modify itself. It can actually grow. Don't worry. It can't do anything without a command signal. [sound waves radiate] - Move! - Move it! Take Mom and the boys. We'll distract the Diablos. Rufus, we're on. Head for the garage! Know how much baby-sitting I had to do to pay for this dress? That would be so cool if it wasn't the last thing we were ever gonna see. - [Dad] Kimmie needs help. - We're talking giant robots. Giant cybertronic robots. Giant cybertronic robots with state-of-the-art weapons. Kim doesn't stand a chance. Boys, how many times have I told you? Anything's possible for a Possible. Jim, Tim, we need to borrow your rockets. Hey, this is the J-200 rocket fuel I developed. I wondered what happened to this. Boys?! Where's that help? Wade, we got a big problem. Anything to do with a giant robot? I think I can relate. Dad says they need a command signal. If you take out the signal, you shut down the robots. I'm not in a position to track the signal for you. It must be coming from the source of all things evil. - Pardon? - Bueno Nacho. Kimmie! Think fast! [both] Blast off! How do we get the rockets to go faster? Look, he even changed the giant taco sign. That's where the command signal's coming from. How are we gonna take that out? Maybe we won't have to. Lookin' the wrong way, dude! [screams] [beeping] - Wade, you're okay? - Yeah. The Diablo has shut down and shrunk down. Thanks to you. We took out the command signal. Which sounds a lot like a good thing, right? That's weird. Just got a hit on the site. Congratulations, Miss Possible. You've already discovered how to foil my evil scheme. In record time, I might add. It is most unfortunate, however, that this time you will not stop me. - You will surrender. - As if. As if if! Shego popped by your school dance and met the nicest boy. Well, I don't have to tell you how nice he is! - And cute. - Kim, what's going on? - Erik! - The choice is yours. If you care about your dear Erik's safety, surrender is your only option. Kim, the battle suit is still experimental. It's about to get a road test. How far is Bueno Nacho headquarters? [Wade] About 100 miles west of here. I think I'd feel better about this if I had a super suit too. - [Ron] I'm just saying! - She's coming. Of course she is. - Okay, Wade. We're going in. - Check your backpack. Knockout gas that looks like lip gloss, or lip gloss that looks like lip gloss? - Knockout gas. - Thanks for checking on that. - Is this a coded message? - History homework. KP, since when are you packing? It looks like a, uh... toy? Oh, this is no toy. Well, not since I modified it. Electromagnetic scrambler. Let's pretend I have no idea what that means. It'll shut down Drakken's whole system. The original Bueno Nacho, where it all started. Ron, keep your head in the game. Worry not, I'm ready for anything. [high squeaky voice] I shall be avenged. Dude, don't talk. The funny voice kinda ruins your mystique. I am strong like the mountain. I am swift like the wind. I am vengeance! Vengeance... will... ...be... ...ay... You know what I really hate? When somebody kidnaps your boyfriend? When somebody doesn't know when to give up. Ooh! Kimmie got an upgrade. Not bad, huh? Yeah, but still not in my league. Like I said... What?! You were saying? Go super suit, Kim girl! Come on, KP, all right! Oh, yeah! Yeah...! Oh! Oh? Oops, sorry, dude, I... Wow! The Ron-dog came to play! Hey, Erik's cute. Once you're out of the picture, maybe I'll date him. Wow. Didn't know you cared that much. Erik! You're okay! - Kim. - Erik. Actually, here, I'm known as Syntho-Drone 901. [Ron groans] Is this heaven? [groans] KP! I thought you were down for the count. Why couldn't I see that he was a fake? You don't get much faker than a Syntho-Drone... Oh, you kissed a Syntho-Drone! I never kissed him. - But I wanted to. - Okay, too much info. - So, what's the plan? - Ron, I... - I got nothing. - That's my line. And what's worse, that's quitter talk! Drakken finally won. I should have stuck to baby-sitting. Okay, KP, this pity fiesta is over. Drakken has not won. He played you. Now it's payback time. And, you know... There are guys out there that are better for you than Erik. Guys that are real, for one thing. You think there's a guy out there for me? Out there... In here. Oh, really? Sure. You know, guys like... Rufus? Rufus? Rufus! You can save us! - Uh-oh. - My backpack! Use the lipstick, Rufus! The other lipstick. Badical! Let's go. Nakasumi's toy design. And dear Daddy Possible's cybertronic breakthrough. And to really stick a pin in it, one made-to-order syntho-hottie. Wait, so you weren't just making it up as you went along? - You questioned my research. - The slumber parties?! Ah! But I discovered Kim Possible's weakness. Boys, boys, boys! "Who should I go to the dance with?" "Who's the perfect boy?" You're right, Drakken. Boys, dating, it's hard. But this is easy! Shego! Syntho-dude, you are going down! What's this? I'm open! Nice try, loser. And by the way, a naked mole rat is not cool, it's gross. Don't be dissin' the Rufus. [Shego] You don't know when to quit. - [Kim] Neither do you. - [Shego] Got that right. Oww! Kim! Got it! So sorry. You know, Rufus did not appreciate that crack. The little dude holds a grudge. Huh? Oh, no! Noooo! Okay, maybe she is all that. Taking over the world is one thing, but you ruined Bueno Nacho. - You're gonna pay. - You can't be serious. Note serious face. Please... the name escapes me. Oh, I beg of you! Say my name. Say it! Uh... It's... ...oh... uh... ...Stoppable. Boo-ya. - You know what I really hate? - That your date melted? Nah. You. This is not over! Oh, this can't be over! Deal with it, dude. It's over. You know, Ron, we'd better hurry. Hurry where? You'll see. [TV] And so, thanks to teen hero Kim Possible, the worldwide Diablo destruction is itself disabled. Possible shoots, she scores! - Straight up! - Excuse me. You're excused. While you're gone, I'll hang with Monique. Me like. It finally happened. She's dating that loser. Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable are dating?! â™ª I know we've been friends forever â™ª â™ª But now I think I'm feeling something totally new â™ª â™ª And after all this time I've opened up my eyes â™ª â™ª Now I see you were always with me â™ª â™ª Could it be you and I â™ª â™ª Never imagined â™ª â™ª Could it be, suddenly I'm falling for you â™ª â™ª Could it be you were right here beside me â™ª â™ª And I never knew â™ª â™ª Could it be that it's true that it's you â™ª â™ª And it's you â™ª â™ª Today is the start of the rest of our lives â™ª â™ª I can see it in your eyes â™ª â™ª That it's real and it's true â™ª â™ª And it's just me and you â™ª â™ª Could it be that it's true â™ª - â™ª That it's you â™ª - â™ª Could it be â™ª â™ª That I never imagined â™ª â™ª Could it be, suddenly I'm falling for you â™ª â™ª Could it be you were right here beside me â™ª â™ª And I never knew â™ª â™ª Could it be that it's true that it's you â™ª â™ª That it's you â™ª â™ª Could it be that it's true that it's you â™ª â™ª That it's you â™ª â™ª Oh, it's you â™ªâ™ª
