You Tube - Video Running Time 02:16:11 You Tube search name - Karigar - It's my turn. - No, it's mine. - Go to hell. - You go to hell, and your husband. Fighting this early in the morning. Don't interfere. Move! Move! Neither you, nor you... I'll fill my bucket first. What witch owns this bucket? Control your tongue, Ganga behen (sister). You dare call me your sister. Unlike you, she's not a servant at some seth's. Take your bucket, and get lost!! She thinks it's her father's tap. She's such a nuisance here. Busy people wait. The jobless line up first. I'll see how she gets first. I'll fill up first. Next, Radha. Kashi, then you. Jamuna, you're next. - How dare you? Did you all see? - Control your tongue... lest I raise my hands against you. Stop laughing. She'll throw your bucket, too. What a comparison! She, a lowly servant, and I a queen. No comparison. Who'd want to... with you? - Is one able to? - Ganga!! Leave my arm. What has the world come to? Leaves in the morning, all dressed up. Returns at night with money. - Such a husband should drown himself. - Who are you blessing this early, dear? My parents. - What happened? - Do you care? Hiding your face here like a woman. My dear, instead of me, it's enough that you show your muscles. Wrapped up in your shroud, you sleep till noon. Has that witch Paro's husband influenced you? Get up. Hari om... Oh, my ears. When will you bathe, eat, and leave for the mill? Do you want to be fired from the mill? I can leave the mill, but not your heart. How gentle your heart is. See! Now you woke my darling boy up. Can't praise your darling boy enough. He's one in a thousand. Curse on you! Can't you say, he's one in a million? Get lost! Go to the mill. My darling boy has to bathe. Tell him to bathe at the tap outside. No. People will cast their evil eyes on him. Yes, father. True. I'll bathe right here. Bless you my son. One day you both will definitely bathe me in Ganga waters. What did father say? Your father came home late. - Don't wake him up. - Actually, his luck should wake up. Right, mother? Come on, get up. I'll get the food ready for you. Okay. I'll be ready soon, too. Mother, hurry up. It's late. I must go. What have you served? Vegetables, roti, and onion. One more onion. Ma, can you give one more roti? For my friend Ramu. He's an orphan. Come with me to the stairs. - Why? - So that my day passes by well. Bansi, be careful on the way. Yes, ma. I will. Ta ta. (Rhymes with 'chaanta'). English went away, but left chaanta (slap) behind. Shoeshine boys have an attitude these days. He shines shoes... doesn't pick pockets. Don't you dare talk nonsense about us. Oh ho!! Oh Jamuna! It's now forbidden to speak the truth in this chaal. Should a shoeshiner be called a king now? Are you satisfied with your shouting? Can't sleep all night. Early morning when I can, you start off. Have you lost all reverence for God? Reverence? Why should I revere him? What has he given us? Even when I do, does he fill our coffers with treasure? And you keep shouting from morning till evening. Do you get enough to eat? You talk such nonsense. I talk sense. Your God has none. - You're so devoted, and yet? - So What? It's the result of one's karma. Is it? Then why do you waste time praying? - What has God given you? - What hasn't he? A lovely husband and son. Oh, Shankar! Girdhari bhai. Did you go to the factory in Kalyan? I did, but it was of no use. - Why? - Don't they need men? - Stop talking nonsense? I'm coming! My dear, I'm coming. Don't worry, I'll speak to another man. This useless stove. Your father brings such wet wood. Ma. When father comes, hit his head with it. What an intelligent mother's boy he is. A pity his father isn't. Talking with every and any one. If you talk to him again, then... you'll teach me a lesson, right? My dear, Shankar's also a human... - not a demon to possess one. - Age hasn't given you any sense. Aren't you ashamed of talking to that shameless man? His life's easy, while his wife and son earn. What do we have in common? Now quickly light the fire and make tea. No, Ma. You light the fire. Father will become a horse for me to ride. A horse? It's time to go to work, you donkey. You made him cry over a triviality. You wasted time talking to that worthless man. Come on. Humor him. But, how to become a horse, dear? - Then become a donkey. - Quiet! Come on. For a short time. Behen, Ganga!! Coming. Father is a donkey! Father is a donkey! Here, have a bidi (Indian cigarettes). No. Why? Please have one? Okay, give. - Why not? You buy food too. - The food is ready. - Eat it when you are hungry. - Yes. I will Oh, Jamuna. You know the song from that famous film? She's going to meet her beloved. I'm dancing on my own. But the cursed world has husbands dancing to their tune. Or else why would one dress up to go wash dirty utensils? - Ganga! - I'm not taking your name. I'm talking about the world. Namaste. He came to the feast yesterday. - The singer of religious hymns? - Yes. Thank you for your wishes. - Do it well. - Yes. This is okay. - Good day. - Good day. Oh, Shankar! Where are you going? Come here. Why don't you help to make Raavan? Every year it is you who make it. I'm wandering jobless for a year now. - What? You don't have a job? - No. - Oh, then go on. Look for one. - Alright. Oh Pundit! The poor man is jobless. So what? His wife earns. What are you saying, Pundit? Translate this into Hindi, please. Destiny. Even God doesn't know it. Do you think, you would? Why aren't you washing the utensils? How will I cook? Don't shout, I'll do them now. Soak the rice first. I know you well. The lady has spoiled you. I'll see that you are sacked. Boot, slippers, or sandals For men or women They all cost one anna Polish costs one anna We ask for nothing Just check out our polishing We trust the one above and are not afraid of anyone We charge one anna for brushing, cleaning, shining Your shoes are clean... but your heart isn't Truth is suspect. It's the era of falsehood It all costs one anna One feels hungry We earn enough to satisfy it We can't do any favors, why do any harm We work hard, then sleep well No one takes their wealth with them Behen Ganga. Your hands move so efficiently still. No one rolls papads like you, for this wedding. Some roll papads at home others do it outside. A woman here goes out and rolls papad all day. And her worthless husband, sits at home. But how can her husband bear it? Is he so shameless? One has to be to live on wife's earnings. Why should I keep quiet? Am I taking names? If he's clever, he'll understand. What an attitude! Trying to intimidate us. He should intimidate his wife... who visits seths under his nose. But Ganga behen, it's not the woman's fault... - if the husband accepts it. - That's what I'm saying. I can't bear this. But what can we do? As long as the husband's all for it. What a topsy turvy world. Wife earns and man sits at home and eats. It's better to take poison. If Bhola's father did this, I would give him poison. Why should a man earn when his wife does? Keep your tongue under control, Ganga behen. Control your wife first. Don't browbeat me. I didn't mention any names. Guilty conscience. Roll the papads. Parvati! Bring the utensils quickly. She takes hours to wash utensils. Sethaniji, sack Parvati, please. She doesn't work at all. The quality of pickle increases with time. But servants become lazy with time. You're right maharaj (cook). Parvati has worked only a year, for us. And you longer. She's fainted! What happened, Paro? She's really fainted. - She's had an attack! - What attack, Sethani? It is an attack of laziness. She's pretending, because she broke the china. Keep quiet maharaj. You always think the worst. Pick her up and take her inside. Paro, wake up. No, no. Stay down. Maharaj, quickly bring hot milk. What are you doing, crazy woman? Lie down. Are you feeling better? What happened to you? I felt dizzy. Sethaniji... - I've broken some dishes, forgive me. - It doesn't matter. Don't cry. Wait. - I'll call the doctor. - No, no, Sethaniji. No need to call a doctor. One does feel dizzy when pregnant. You are pregnant? Why didn't you tell me earlier? You shouldn't be working in your delicate condition. - If I don't work what will we eat? - Why? Your husband must be earning too? How to tell you Sethaniji? For a year he has been jobless. He can't find a job in this big city? He's not trained for the work he gets. And he doesn't get what he's trained for. What's he trained for? He's a highly skilled craftsman. He's a carpenter. Does anything with wood. There might be only two or four like him in Mumbai. And only one fool like you in Bombay. We need people with such skills. We have a very large furniture factory. There are 200 workmen. - He can be one of them. - Milk! Here, drink the milk. I'll phone seth right now. What did you say? We haven't received the tender yet? I'll see to it. What is it, Murari? Sir, we have a lot of work, but not enough workers. If you agree, we can get three or four more people. Are 200 workers not enough? Sir, not enough workers of the type we need. - What do you mean? - With more people, by Diwali the order can be completed. One by one you've increased the number. Hire one more man. Yes? You know our Parvati? Who works at home? She's pregnant. The poor woman's husband has no job. Give him a job in our factory. Send him with a letter. You need a man, don't you? There's no need now, sir. I'll manage. No, a man will come with Sethaniji's letter, tomorrow. - Hire him. - Yes, sir. Ram Dayal! I couldn't do what you wanted, Pundit. Sethani has recommended someone for the job. Here, take your money back. Keep it. If not today, then some other day. Courage will bear fruit. No fear while you're there. Okay. Here's the letter. For your husband. Tell him to go to the factory tomorrow morning. Seth has promised to employ him. Sethaniji, you've made our lives. He'll be very happy to get the job. Now we'll have a home. I'll never forget your kindness. May God keep you happy, Sethaniji. Now don't work too hard. Shankar! Did you find a job? No, brother. My luck is unfavorable. - Not many have your luck. - What do you mean? Your boy earns, and pundit says... Come here pundit. You have kept your wife at Sethji's. What did you say, pundit? - Doesn't she work there? - You said 'kept there'. It's the same. Let it be. - Get out of here! - Leave it, Shankar. Go home. - I won't spare him. - Go home. Come on, work fast. (Children playing kabaddi) - You're out! - No, Bhola, you're out. You couldn't hold your breath. Instead of agreeing, you're fighting. Such a crybaby. Such a sissy. Wear a skirt and blouse. Girl? So what? Go out! Go out! I won't. No one dare tell me to go out. Is this your father's property? Don't talk of my father. - I'll kill you. - I'll bite you. I'm dead. I'm dead. Why should you? Worthless's son will die. Oh Ganga!! Oh Radha. Anybody! What happened? Don't ask. Can't you see? Look. He beat him so badly. That pauper's son. Don't just stand there. Call the police, someone. Today he beat my child. Tomorrow he'll beat yours. Then he'll beat up all the children in the world. Yes, he'll beat up the children. Ganga's now possessed with Devi. Bring kumkum (red powder). She's a wicked woman. Don't you dare bad mouth my mother. You dare oppose the devi? Ask her where you lost your ring. Devi, I've lost my ring. Where is it? Put the kumkum. - The ring! - Devi! Devi! The ring! Gold ring? Yes. It's gold. It's right here. In this chaal. It's in someone's home. Devi, tell the name. Paro. She's telling a lie. My mother's not a thief. She's the real devi. She's an evil woman. If you're a real devi, tell us, is he a boy or a monkey. Your mother's a monkey. What happened? What's going on? Ask your son what happened. He's made mincemeat of my son. You can't control your son, and live on your wife's earnings. Come. Go! Don't just stand around. Call the police. Get in. Scoundrel. You misbehave, but she insults me. - Just listen bapu. - Quiet! Why were you playing with him? You've been told not to. - He started it. - Liar! It's become difficult to live here. What's the matter with you? Why did you hit him? He forgets himself and gets entangled with the rich. I'll teach you a lesson for hitting Bhola. - That's enough. - Enough? Because of him I was insulted by Bhola's mother. So you hit him because of that witch? - Is she lying? - Then what? - You believed her? - Just be quiet. Leave him. Don't take out your frustration on him. - What are you saying? - The right thing. Poor boy works hard all day. You too. I'm the worthless one. Is that what you mean? - Listen. - That's enough. Don't cry, son. For you, I quarrelled with your father. That wasn't good. Couple of slaps would've been better than his going away in anger. Don't know when he'll be back. Don't worry son. Bansi? Why did you hit Bhola? Ma, I didn't hit him. It's not my fault. He bit me. That looks bad. Come. I'll put oil on it. His teeth should've broken. Ma, if you say, I'll break them all tomorrow. Don't you dare talk like that. I'll spank you. Why do you play with him? He cries like a girl if I don't. And bites like a dog when I do. Go and wash. I'll get food for you. Be quiet now. Everyone's heard you. - Have they? - Yes. - Shall I stop? - Yes. Enough. How could MY son lose in the fight? Aren't you ashamed? How can your son lose, ma? I bit his hand, hard. Like this. So hard? - After all, whose son are you? - Yours. Bravo! Now I'll serve my darling son some halwa. I don't want halwa. - I want... - bhajjiya? I'll make it at once. Ma, a foot massage is logical. Feet get tired while walking. But why massage my hands? Hands must also get tired polishing shoes whole day? You're so innocent, ma. I don't polish with my hands. I use a brush. Ma, you use hands to wash dishes. They must be tired. Come, I'll massage them. I, too, don't scrub with my hands. I use coir. Really? It's 9 o'clock, ma. Father hasn't returned yet. He'll return when his anger subsides. Have sweets. Speak softly or else my wife will nag me. Is everything Okay? Why this two-fold music today? Say something. Bhola, you tell. Mother knows. Why are we crying, mother? If something happens to me, Bhola... who'll look after you? Yes. Father, who'll look after me? First let her die. Then I'll manage. You want me to die? My son was beaten black and blue. Show him your head, son. Ma, not the head. He slapped me. Then show your face. - See father. - Did you see? His face is red. The face is red from eating halwa. Not from slaps. Alright, now leave children's fights alone. Children's fight? If I hadn't reached in time... he'd have been killed. Don't just stand there. Call the police. Get Bansi handcuffed. Ma, I bit his hand hard. How can he be handcuffed now? Have you heard? It's your darling's fault. Let children's fights alone. Give me food. I didn't cook today. I made halwa. So, I'll have halwa. One needs a personality to eat halwa. So that's why you're eating it? Live long. We'll live. Death should come to Shankar's family. Stop cursing the poor family. - Give me my meal now. - Cook it yourself. - Let's go, Bholu. - Yes. Long live my devoted son. I was warned not to marry during the shradh period. The washerman was asked about his unfairness to his wife. He said... a woman's character should be upright. My wife's got a bad name. The neighbors call her loose. I'm forced to throw her out of the house. Hearing this, Lord Ram became thoughtful. You are so late. Food is ready. Come and have it. I don't want to. Why not? You haven't eaten since morning. I'm not hungry. Please have your meal. Don't be stubborn. Come. One shouldn't take out one's anger on food. God gets angry. What does your God do? He's made a young worthless man eat his wife's earnings. The same thing again? You were feeding us till now. It doesn't matter if now I do. From tomorrow... What... from tomorrow? First eat, then I'll tell you. First tell me, then I'll eat. Beginning tomorrow, you have a new job. - Where? - Where I work. At that seth's. - I get it. - They have a big factory. I'll die, but not work there. You won't work? - Why not? - Who do you think I am? I'm a decent man. I'll die, but not stoop. What a respectable job it is. I make the bed while you massage Seth's feet. Are you crazy? Where was your pallu when you begged Seth for the job? What are you saying? What everyone is saying. I didn't believe them. I trusted you. Now I know it's the opposite. Aren't you ashamed to talk like that? You should be ashamed for deceiving your husband. I don't want to hear anything more. Is this what I get? Is this the fruit of all I do? For this day you married me? Don't shed crocodile tears. I know you well. Strangle me before accusing me. Why don't you kill me? Similar injustice has always been meted out to women. Raja Nal left Damayanti. What was Ahiliya's fault that Gautam's curse turned her to stone? She was redeemed only when... the feet of Ram, who was unjust to Sita. All because of a washerman... he abandoned a pregnant Sita. Laxman took her to the forest... and he told her Ram's wishes. Lord Ram has abandoned you. Because she was impure? Sita couldn't hear this. She swooned and fell to the ground. My Ram is not happy with me He gave his Sita... the name - impure. By what means, brother Laxman... should I make him see? He said... carry out your deeds... till the earth takes you While dying... Ram's name should be on the lips Why would Sita live after hearing... such words from Ram? She had to She was pregnant She would bear it... for the sake of the child Paro. Say something. What should I say? I should have died before what you said. I should die of shame for saying those things. I should be the one to die. I know my fault can't be forgiven. I won't face you. I'll go away. - Where will you go? - Anywhere, Paro. I'm giving you and Bansi much pain and hurt. But... It's not your fault. It's our neighbor's fault. They provoke you to anger. Honestly, I'm innocent. I know Paro. I'm guilty of having a very bad temper. I try so hard to control it... but... You won't get angry if I say something? I won't, Paro. Speak what's in your heart. I'll listen quietly. I know you are good hearted. But your temper is of equal intensity. Today you hit Bansi unnecessarily. It wasn't his fault at all. It was Bhola who bit him. Then why didn't he...? See, I'm getting angry again. The idiot should have told me. Do you ever listen? You didn't listen to me either. Let alone speaking with Sethji. I've never even seen him. I spoke to Sethani. They have a very big furniture factory. She's very kind. Today I felt dizzy while working. She looked after me. You didn't tell me. I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow. This is a good illness. - Is illness good? - Sometimes. Sometimes? - You didn't understand? - No. We are getting a visitor. You're pretending illness because of our penniless state. Don't fear. Who is it? I'll write to say, "Don't come brother." No, not brother. Son. Whose son? Now I feel dizzy. Now I get it. - Your God should know better. - Don't talk like that. People come with their own destiny. And I hit you in your condition. Why didn't these hands break? Angry again? These hands are the wealth of my craftsman. Now will you go with the letter? - I'll go right now. - At night. Oh, they'll think I'm crazy. - Are you happy now? - Yes, Paro. Very. - Come and eat. - No, no. Why not? You haven't eaten at all. First feed your visitor. Then I'll eat. Get up son. Hurry up! Seth saab will be here soon. - What are you doing there? - Hurry up! Pull this rope. Hey. Where are you going? - I've to meet the seth. - He's not here. Go away. - Isn't that the seth? - No, he's the manager. Let him come chowkidar (watchman). I've brought a letter from Sethaniji. So you are that craftsman? Such craftiness. Pandu, get a chair for saab. I've come for a job. Yes, you'll get one, or else I'll lose mine. You'll get Rs 7 per day. Come tomorrow at 7 sharp, with your tools. The factory has tools, I'm sure, saab. You're employed temporarily. Understood? But, I don't have any tools. That you don't have tools is not my responsibility. - I have Sethaniji's letter. - So what can I do? The letter says to give you a job. Not tools, sweets, halwa, bed and all. Sethji has arrived. Move. - Is everything ready for the pooja? - Yes ji. Everything's ready. Sir, this is the new worker. - I've brought Sethaniji's letter. - Yes, we know. Sir, I've asked him to start work tomorrow. That's good. You shouldn't follow your superiors. I've told you to come tomorrow with your tools. - Or else... Pandu... - No, no. I'll come with my tools. Hey. Don't touch the car. Go away. Why suggest such workers? Come to work, too, Pandu. Do you have a beedi, Paro? Didn't you get the job? - I did. Rs 7 per day. But... - Rs 7 per day? But why aren't you smiling? How to smile? I need Rs 70. Rs 70? What for? Don't I need tools? We sold all ours. - So there they... - Yes, Paro. No work without tools. It's my fault. You sold for my illness. Don't say that. It was for you. But, what now? Nothing. Found, and lost a job. That's all. We can't lose this chance. Somehow you should get this job. I know it's important. Especially for you... Selling the house won't even yield 70p. How to get Rs 70? Why don't you borrow from a friend? Together we'll pay back the debt. No one befriends a pauper. Only another pauper does. Just try. God will show the way. - I'll go for you. Not for God. - Okay. Give me a beedi. - I've got a job, Rs 7 per day. - That's good news. After so long. - I need a favor. - Yes? Can you lend me Rs 70 to buy tools? I've just lent Rs 150 to a friend. Had you come 5 minutes earlier... Doesn't matter Kishan bhaiya. My bad luck. I'm sure you'll pay the debt in one month. But the future is uncertain. Kallu borrowed Rs 50. Poor man. He died the next day. Who'll pay his debt now? Anything else, I can do? Never mind. Sethji, I'm asking for Rs 75 only. Here it's a give and take system. What can you sell or deposit for it? I've always paid my debts with the interest. Interest, I'll take. But the deposit? Lend me on trust. We trust only the deposit. - I've nothing to give you as security. - What's this? Give it. I'll give you the money at once. This is brass, and glass. Will it do? Nothing but gold. Understand? - So shall I go away disappointed? - No. Why? You are our customer. Have papad before you go. Youth never comes back. Why to cry over spilled milk? Youth is crazy. Falters at every step, yet doesn't learn. Girdhari brother. - Who is it? - Shankar. Oh Shankar? Come in. Why are you standing outside? I was just blackening the face of old age. - What can I do? - I've got a job. Rs 7 per day. Great! Congratulations. But I need Rs 70 for tools. I didn't get them from anywhere. If I don't get them, I'll lose the job. - You'll lose the job? Rs 70? Never mind. I was just thinking, how to take out Rs 70. Fortunately you came when I'm alone. Sit down. I'll give you Rs 70. You'll get Rs 70 right away. If friends don't help, what use is friendship? It's good your bhabi (sis-in-law)'s not home. She would have insulted you, and sent you away. Here. Aren't you ashamed of stealing? Money doesn't grow on trees to hand it out freely. I'll pay it back. You'll pay back?! A man living off his wife's earnings. Watch his attitude. - Didn't get anything? - Of course I got some things. I got insults, taunts, was badmouthed. I should have drowned myself. No one helps a pauper. Don't utter inauspicious words on Dussehra. What's auspicious or inauspicious? It's one's duty to try. And your God makes all attempts futile. Why did you marry a penniless man? Parvati also married Bholenath (Shiv). - I'm fortunate to have you. - Great fortune indeed. No one is ready to lend me even Rs 10. People avoid the poor. A wife won't do that. Today I'll help you. Paro, I know you help me. Even with a job. But where'll you get the tools from? You'll get them. From where? I have something. Sell it. What do you have? I've sold everything. There's nothing left. I have this Mangalsutra. (wedding necklace) - It has gold to buy the tools. - Are you crazy? How can I sell this? This is only a symbol. You are the real thing. Sell it. How's it possible? No, I can't commit this sin. It's not a sin. If God drowns, no use saving his headgear. I'm doing this for you. Paro, you... Don't feel bad. Raja Harishchandra sold his wife and child. You're selling only a piece of jewelry. That too, to earn a living. Okay. Give it. How can I? You tied it. You take it off. Tie this black thread instead. God preserve us. I'm a new bride again. Bansi. Look, how many tools I've bought. What are you doing there? Come and see. Father, did you buy all this? No, I sold it. Father, I too will buy my stuff for shoe polishing. - What will you buy? - No, I'll sell. I don't need it anymore. - Father will earn, I'll relax. - That's not right. You'll go to school. Become an Engineer. - I won't become an Engineer. - No? Mother! I want to become a municipality officer. You heard father? Then I won't remove any worker from the footpath. Thank God for laughter in our home. And on this holy Dussehra day a craftsman regained his tools. Give, I'll sharpen it. - No, first I'll worship it. - Do you think it's God? Don't laugh. Yes. Whatever brings happiness is worth worshipping. Is that so, ma? Then do puja of my tools too. Does one worship shoe polishing stuff? Father, cleaning shoes helped to clear the grocer's debt. Go on. Put it back. - You've returned? - Were you dreaming? - I'll get the aarti. - She was dreaming. Can't give anything right now, Paro. I'm broke. Take this gold (shami leaf - given at Dussehra). This is more than diamonds and pearls. - But now I have a job... - Here, sweeten your mouth. I'll go meet the people of the chaal. - Ma. - My dear, we are home. Where'd you disappear? I've been waiting so long to do the aarti. - Father, aarti for what? - To do. Don't you see? Here, hold the gold branches. Ma. We've brought so many. They'll last several years. What? Again this grass and leaf stuff? A few grams of real gold wouldn't have bankrupted you. My father used to give my mother 120 grams of gold on Dussehra. But he gave only 24 grams at our wedding Did you expect an airplane? The amount is equal to the person's value. Yes father. Understood? At Bhola's wedding I'll take a half kilo of gold from the girl's family. Why half? If it depends on the groom... we'll take 1 kilo. Okay, quiet. Let me first do the aarti. First do mine. First get out of shorts and into long trousers. - Sweeten your mouth. - No need. - You did that on our arrival. - Come on. Take. - I'm going now. - Where? To loiter around? No. Just want to check how they do aarti at my friends'. - Father's gone? - Yes. What a sharp edge! Today your lips look sharp (attractive) too. You look happy. Well, well. Let everyone be happy. Did you prick your finger? Let me see. This state of being broke draws blood one way or another. We aren't broke anymore. You've found a job. Yes, but the job hasn't brought in any money yet. That will also happen. Get some new clothes when you get paid. For me or you? For you. This last one year I couldn't get you any new clothes. I don't have to attend any wedding. Our own wasn't eons ago. You should still dress up. I know my unemployed state has given you pain. Again? Annoyed? When women get annoyed love is put aside, and annoyance dominates. If you talk like that I'll really get annoyed. I know how to humor you when you get annoyed. Take. Take off your shirt. Let me put in a few stitches. What can you do about this shirt? There are so many holes. What are you looking at? What I can't bear to. When we got married... your hands were like butter. Washing utensils have made them so rough. I won't be scrubbing utensils any more. Now I'll be the queen here. Of course. And Bansi'll be the Prince. No more shoe-shining. I'll admit him in a school. He'll become an engineer, and I an engineer's father. What are you thinking? It's all because of my Giridhari's blessings. Tomorrow when you get the job don't forget the offering to God. Why do you want to bribe god? Don't talk like that. With reverence take God's finger. He'll lead you across. You can hold God's finger. I'll hold yours. - Really? - Really. Okay. Then hold. Get up.

The one to worry about this world is the One... who's the Lord of this world Everyone does what one has to... but He gives the fruit The One whose light is everywhere... and yet we can't see Him It's better to be satisfied with the fruit of one's labor... than to sit around doing nothing Labor is our pilgrimage to the four Himalayan abodes Labor represents Sita and Ram Oh you free spirit... why don't you understand the wisdom of Geeta? What? What's the matter with you? - What are you looking at? - I've already seen it, Father. What have you already seen? - Oh, you know how to laugh? - Didn't I ever laugh earlier? This last year you've growled like a lion. Now your laughter is high class. - Always keep laughing. - See how he talks. - After all whose son are you? - Let's shake hands. Before going to work sweeten your mouth. Yes. It's sweet. The real sweetness will be when father gets his pay. - You're right. - Bapu, how much will you get? Rs 7 daily. My earnings of a week? - Of course. - You must give a high class party. - It will be done. - Then let's shake hands. - Here's your lunch. - Mine too. I told you yesterday No more shoe shining.

I'm not lying, but in the last 30 years... not once have I smiled at my husband. Don't just stare at me. Say well done! Well done behen Ganga. - How can a filthy mouth smile? - What? I have a filthy mouth? - Just repeat that. - I didn't mention any names. Come have tea. We'll have pani puri at Chowpatty. I'll come to fetch you. Oh dear. Pick it up. Who's picture is this? Is he a craftsman? A very big one. He fought for the country. Subhash Chandra Bose.

Inspector, I don't think it's an inside job. You all may go. Do you need to ask her anything more? No. Don't worry. You go in. They'll do their best to find out. - May I ask something, Sethji? - Yes.

Ramu, come here. His father died last year. Take it Ramu. Something to remember me by. Please look after him. Please share your food with Ramu. Goodbye. Bansi, do come on your free day. Where are you going? - See the wonder of my knowledge. - Please let go of my hand. I can't release such a hand, you fortunate man. Last I saw such a hand, it was a king's. - I'm a craftsman. - So what? You can become a king too. Just watch the wonders of my knowledge. - The wonder is mostly my own effort. - You are right. The wonder has to come from you. But I'll show you your future. That's the wonder of my knowledge. Just give Rs 1.25. Son, how much bhelpuri can we get for Rs 1.25? - A lot, father. - So, let's spend it there. Don't go any further. There's danger ahead. Rahu and Ketu are standing ahead. Son, do you see Rahu Ketu (2 stars) standing ahead? No, only Punditji. You won't see them. I'm an astrologer. I see them. Don't go any further. My future is in my bag. Let us go. It's your wish. But you'll get stranded and come back. - This blows well. Can I have it? - Is it good? - How much? - Four annas. Okay, four annas. Let it be. He's a child. Don't blow it everywhere. The police will arrive. Whether a Brahmin or a farmer... whether a pauper or an emperor... a governor or a Lord... everyone eats my chaat... from here in Chowpatty It is delicious and very spicy... this chaat of Chowpatty This contains hot spices Tastes a little sour. Thin person eats this and... becomes strong This modern city Bombai A turban on the head, a hefty stomach Quarreling with the wife To make up, eat my ragda It's medicine for the stomach. The illness will disappear Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Parsi... all get united... while enjoying the wonders of Bambai's bhel The bhel is piping hot Whoever eats my Panipuri... his life will change His thoughts fly high like a kite... and forgets everything, name work, price - I was able to grab this kite. - Where's the bag? - I put it right here, Bapu. - You left the bag to get this kite? No, Bapu, it was right here. I'll go and look for it. Have you found it? - Have you? - No, Bapu. Bansi, Have you found the bag? - No, Bapu, it's nowhere. - Look! He's running away with it. Run after him. - What? - From where did you steal this bag? - I didn't steal it. It's mine. - It's mine. - Give it! - No! - I'll give you such a beating. - What's going on? - He's troubling me. Come to the police station. - They were fighting on the footpatrh. - Fighting? Saab he was running away with my bag. - No saab, it's mine. - Saab, I lost this bag at Chowpatty. - No it's mine. - Saab... - he won't show what's in it. - Why should I? - Wait! What's in there? - My tools, lost at Chowpatty. - It doesn't contain tools. - Then what's in there? - It's none of your business. - See, he's not showing. Show! Here. Look. Satisfied? - I apologize. It contains a bottle. - And not your tools? - Alright saab. I'll leave. - Wait. - Why saab? - What's in the bottle? - Medicine - Show me. - Here. Don't open it. It'll get spoiled. Is that so? Constable, imprison him. - Why? - Because you sell liquor. I don't sell liquor. I drink it. And I have permission for it. Permit. - Arrest him anyway. - Why saab? You are permitted whiskey. This is county liquor. What's the difference? They are both liquor. - Shut up! - But this is unfair. I have the permission. - You can go. - What about my tools, sir? While Bansi was running after the kite, someone stole my tools. Yes saab. I ran leaving the bag behind. - And the bag disappeared. - Don't worry. Report this in the outer office. We'll do our best. My job depends on it. I got it after a long gap. Don't worry, don't worry... Havaldar (constable)! Take them to the flea market and search for the tools there. You might find them there. Okay, you can go. Come on Bansi. You're back! The stars told me you would. I've been looted. Looted or not, I knew you'd be back. Your stars are not good. Take out Rs 1.25. I'll make them good. - Bapu, first ask questions. Only then give the money. - Keep quiet. - Yes, yes. Give. - Here take. - My tools got stolen. - Of course they'd get stolen. Didn't I tell you? Rahu was standing in front of you. I won't say anything. This bird will. Come, son. Come. Tell the poor man his luck. Come on, take. Take. Here's your luck. Take this. Read. I'll take too long. You read it. That's okay. I'll read it. It's enough that you've touched it. Go and celebrate. You've found what you lost. The enemy is defeated. You've won. Do you have a mole? - Mole? - Yes. On your shoulder? Yes, you have one on your shoulder. Maybe. But will I find the tools? Definitely. The thief has gone 40 steps east and has returned to the west. He left Chowpatty... crossed the road and is standing near the hospital. - Now? - He's crossed from the South... - and is going North. - That's towards our house, Bapu. He was in the West, is coming from the South... he... he... So, search in all directions. You'll find him. But what's the result? A second question. Give Rs 1.25 more, I'll tell you all. Give. I have only Rs 1. Forget about it. Your wish. But it's all a question of Rahu. Nothing but stealing, in your stars. - Just leave it. - Your wish. Your life's in danger. Believe me. Paro behen, haven't they returned yet? I wonder why they're so late. Aunt, Bansi hasn't returned yet? You fight with Bansi, but can't be without him. My mother is responsible for it. - Really? - Yes. - There he goes, bapu. - Let's follow. No, you wait here. Before youth arrived... her world was something else There was simplicity in manner... and her smile was different In no time, what a revolution has taken place Youth arrived, and... such youth! A glimpse is not enough When the veil is removed, the heart races There's no comparison left with anyone Even the sun... doesn't face her now Thank god that she... seldom comes out of purdah But the day she does, the admirers swoon He plays the tabla well. Smiling lips, mischievous eyes... when one has seen... I swear, one has seen the end of the world come alive The hearts of the people on earth... must've often stopped beating What the angels saw... must've made them bow, too What are you doing here? - Bapu has gone up. - Bapu has gone up? Why are you moving away from me? Those... Those... Amma, tell everyone I won't dance anymore. - No, no. That's not the thing. - Let them go, then we'll talk. - Talk about what? - Have you all heard? Mumtaz won't dance anymore. Please come tomorrow. Will Mumtaz dance tomorrow? - Yes, Yes. - If not Mumtaz then her mother. Come on, come on. Go now. Listen. Because of you, I sent them away. - Now sit and relax. - How can I? You look worried. What's the matter? I've lost something. And have been searching for so long. And now you've found it? That bag there... Amma, could you make some paan? Sure, beti (daughter). - No, no. I don't chew paan. - Sethji... pass me that bag, please. Here. Why are you looking there? Look at me. - Come on. Look at me. - Just wait. Oh. Paan!! Yes. You'll have, no? Downstairs a shop sells good tobacco. I'll go get some. - I'll send someone. - No I'll go myself. Just listen. - Where's the bag? - There's no bag. - Get up. - Okay, I will, I will. In spite of your disguise, I recognize you. - We both are in the same business. - What business? I'll give. Take Rs 20. Leave me alone. I want the bag, not money. Bag? I won't give it up. Come to the police station. Okay, I'll give it. Stop whistling, and give the bag. - I won't. - No? - Get lost. - He has my bag. Go on. There's no bag. - I won't get my bag? - No! Run! Let's run away, bapu. Did you get hurt? I'm alive. Come on. The bag is here. It contains money. Throw it away. The police will catch us. Run. What happened, suddenly? Bapu, your bag is lost. From tomorrow you have no job. - That is so. Come on. - And you'll beat everyone. Okay, I won't. Come on. I'm sorry. Did you see the bag? Yes, bap... That will also have paan or bottles. Come on. No bapu. What if it's the real one? - Then? - Should we? - There's a memsaab standing there. - So what? Be courageous. Okay, let's see. I'm nervous, but I'll try to be bold. Memsaab, I think my bag has been taken inside. May I go and check? I can? You can't come in. Stay here with memsaab. I am Rosie I am Mary I am Cherry Dolly's my name Baby, oh baby, why bother with a name? Johnny's a slave to his heart She has Chameli's face, but a different name on the lips So why should anyone be deceived? The name is Miss Bholi (lnnocent), but the heart isn't. That's dangerous I've come running from home How about us becoming a couple? The face isn't radiant, the tongue is sharp, pretending to be young See my golden hair, Johnny Forget it, Mary. It isn't real I bid goodbye to the one who hides the truth I am Rosie I am Mary I am Cherry Dolly's my name Baby, oh baby, why bother with a name? Johnny's a slave to his heart - Speak Hindi, saab. - Why are you spoiling the dance? Did I come here to dance? - I came to check a bag. - Check a bag? - It contains my tools. - Tools? What tools? I'm a carpenter. I've lost my tools. - I came to see what's in the bag. - Wait. Are you a real carpenter, or a pretender? Saab, I'm real. You are pretenders. We are pretenders? - Oh Bansi. - The police have come. Wait. Show me what it contains. You're all junglee, the way my turban was treated. I excused her because she was a girl. Show. Look man. Now go from here. - This isn't for a carpenter. - Did you find them, bapu? No I didn't. Let's go. - Now what, bapu? - It can't get any worse. Sit down. I'm tired. Your mother must be worried at home. All because of me. Forget it now. But without your tools you won't have a job. - The job is definitely lost. - And I gave away my box. - You gave the box away? - You told me to. Troubles come together. I don't even have a bidi. What's he doing? He's put his hand in the drain. Look! Is that ours? It looks like ours. Finally we've found it. You wait here. - I'm not a thief, saab. - Take him to the police station. I stopped when I saw you all. Why were you running. Because my bag got stolen this evening. I found it and snatched it from the thief, but he chased me to get it back. The thief ran after stealing, and you ran after snatching stolen goods from him. - What's the story? - This is my bag. I'm a carpenter. - What's in the bag? - My tools. - You can see. - Show. What tools are there? Screwdriver, plane, saw. Is this a screwdriver? - What's this? Jewelry? - This isn't mine, saab. Just now you said it was yours. Whose is it? I don't know saab. You take it away. Handcuff him, and take him to the police station. Bansi, come quickly. Who is it? Wait. I'm coming. Who's it at this hour? Paro, you? Is all well? You're crying. Did you quarrel with Shankar? What's the matter? Please tell. Come in. Don't be nervous. Come. Bhola's mother is sleeping. I'm awake, not sleeping. If you ever step inside this house again, I'll break your leg. - Listen, Bhola's mother... - Bhola's mother isn't so innocent. I understand this. Has Sethji lost all his money that you're here now? What are you saying, Ganga behen? I came to call Giridhari bhaiya. I knew one day you'd come. I understand the meaning of your hymns. Come Giridhari. Oh, my dear Giridhari. Call me Giridhari. Will you stop your hymn? - Let the poor woman speak. - What will she say in front of me? Rob other homes after the death of Shankar. Don't say such things, Ganga behen. I'm already getting such bad thoughts. She's shamelessly confessing about her bad thoughts. Will you stop talking? Let her say what she wants to. - What is it, Paro? - Giridhari bhaiya... neither Bansi nor his father have returned home yet. Oh. Bansi's father hasn't come home... so you came to take Bhola's father? You be quiet. Have they both not returned? No, bhaiya. After many days he went to work today... and hasn't returned. What a drama queen. Find a job in a film company. You'll earn a lot of money. Stop talking nonsense or I'll raise my hands. This witch turned a jackal into a lion? No. She woke up a sleeping lion. Paro behen, I'll look for him and bring him back. Wait. Who will go to look for you? Go and lie down quietly on that mat. I'm warning you. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Remember, I'll raise my hands against you. Her husband's in danger and you're talking nonsense non-stop. Get out of my way. Paro behen, I'll search every corner of Bambai... and bring him back. Don't fear. Giridhari uncle! What happened, Bansi? Let's go and free bap... - What happened? - The police have arrested him. Bansi, stop. Bansi. I've heard all. I'll tell the whole chaal. Oh, Jamuna. Oh Radha! The police have arrested Shankar. Listen all chaali people. Shankar's been arrested. He must have stolen something. Did you hear Giridhari? The world says he's a thief. Is that possible? Can the hands of a craftsman steal? You can hear everyone. Why can't you hear me. Speak Giridhari. My lifelong, worship, and devotion... has come to beg at your door. If you don't accept it... then who'll believe in you? All the holy scriptures, your whole world... will be proven false. Say something Giridhari. You won't talk? Then listen. I made no difference between you and my husband. If my husband's a thief... then so are you. If he drowns in the sea of shame... then you'll not sit here in comfort. Get up from here. Until my husband gets back his respect... stay in this cold water. Why did you let the thief escape? Then all would have been alright. Uncle, walk on. I'll be back soon. - Where are you going? - You go. I'll come back. Yes, this is all mine. But some things are missing. My gold watch... Rolex automatic, and... Sethani's wedding necklace... and Rs 500 notes. Can't say anything about the notes. He must have spent it, but.. We'll find the wedding necklace and the watch. We've caught the thief. We'll ask him with love if he refuses to tell. What does the man do? Just stealing? He's a clever man. Calls himself a carpenter. He also says he works for you. - For us? - Yes. - I'd like to see him. Come. So, he's the man? Seth saab. I didn't want to trouble you, but... I had to tell them I work for you. They think I'm a thief. - Save me saab. - I didn't come for you. I've come to identify the jewelry. - They were yours? - Yes. All are there except two. Where's the gold watch and wedding necklace? Do you think that I stole them, Seth saab? I'm not a thief. I'm speaking the truth. Are they lying? They caught you running away with them - Seth saab, I was after my stolen bag of tools... - A lie. Tell us where the gold watch, and wedding necklace are? I didn't steal. How can I steal from your place? I earn my bread from you. Does he really work for you? I gave him work just yesterday. But his wife is our dishwasher. Oh. So, his wife is a servant at your place? Yes. They were hungry. I gave bread. Gave him employment. This is a good return from you. - Don't say that Seth saab. I'll be ruined. - That's the right course. I thought the poor were good and honest. But you have proved otherwise. This is the right place for you. - Come on inspector saab. - Seth saab, listen. - Be quiet. He Raghu, get up. Hey Jaggu. Bholu, Pandu, Chandu... Come with me. Let's go free bapu from the police. Hurry up. Run. He's running away. You go this side... You from that side, you all too. Inspector saab. - Inspector saab. - Giridhari bhaiya. - Shankar. Giridhari bhaiya, I'm blameless. Inspector saab, he's a very decent man. Why have you arrested him? - Who are you? - He's my neighbor. I'm Giridhari. I've known him for 30 years. He can't even dream of stealing. Inspector saab, release him. So what we saw was false? He was caught red handed fleeing with the stolen goods. Things went wrong, Giridhari bhaiya. I thought the bag had tools. But it had jewelry. I didn't do anything. Yes, yes lnspector saab will see to everything. He didn't do anything. It was a different bag. Catch the real thief. Release him. You're absolutely right. We should arrest the real thief. Oh yes, yes. I told you the inspector would... Go to Parel. Bring Parvati from Room 13. Paro? Why? Why her lnspector saab? First him now Paro. - Are you alright? - Quiet. We're certain Parvati stole the jewelry. While cleaning utensils she cleaned out his safe. For safe keeping she gave it to her husband. That's why he was running with it. - Is it a lie? - It is, lnspector saab. - Go and arrest her. - Arrest her? Inspector saab... No, no. Inspector saab, Don't bring her here. She doesn't know anything. Not even... that I stole. - Don't bring her here, lnspector saab. - Shankar. Keep quiet Giridhari bhaiya. Inspector saab, I admit to stealing. Did you see? He admitted it without coercion. And you came to support him? Inspector saab, don't you realize that... a good man is telling a lie to save his wife from humiliation? Giridhari bhaiya, I'm telling the truth. You know... I've been jobless for days. I was fed up of it. They are unnecessarily arresting Paro. I stole the jewelry. Shankar, shut up. Do you know the result of this? You'll get jailed. So what if they bring Paro behen? No, no no. Giridhari bhaiya. They'll imprison her. Nobody will believe us. We are laborers. Thieves. Cheaters. Nobody will listen to us. Inspector saab, he's lying. No, no. - I'm telling the truth. - Now we must bring Parvati. He's taking the wife's blame on himself. Now we are sure she's the real culprit. Here's the real thief. We caught him with great difficulty. Leave him. He's the man from whom I snatched the bag. What's he saying saab? - I've never seen him. - Don't tell lies. - Tell the truth. - Leave. - Who are you? - A man. I can see that. From where have you come? I was hiding... err... sleeping in a temple. These boys caught me And the bag in that man's hands? Whose was it? Not mine saab. - It's his. - Whose? - I don't know. - Whose watch is this? - Mine. - Yours? - Where did you buy it? - From a shop. - I know from a shop. - How much is it? - About Rs 200/250 saab. - What make is it? - National. National? Inspector saab, remove the watch and put handcuffs instead. This is a Rolex. For Rs 2500, and you say Rs 250? Search him, havaldar. Be careful havildar bhai. He's very dangerous. Look, inspector saab. He tried to strangle him. We've seen many dangerous like him. - I don't have anything. - Be quiet. Saab. A knife. - I have nothing. - Quiet. Saab, money. Here's the wedding necklace. Wedding necklace and Rolex watch. He's definitely the thief. Havildar. Handcuff him. And release that good man. Come Shankar, come. Here's the watch and wedding necklace. Bravo, son. You saved the honor of your father and law. You've come back. The police arrested me. Why did this happen? What have we done? Our luck is bad. I'm jinxed. You must have suffered there. The police must have mistreated you. This happened on the very day you got a job. Paro, the job's lost. Lost? How? The bag of tools got stolen. When I found it, there was jewelry in it. The police took me to their station. That was Seth's lost jewelry. Paro, he came to the police station, called me names, and went away. Does he think you're the thief? The thief's caught. But my name's besmirched. Who'll give me a job now? What'll we do now? How'll we face the people? You're right Paro. Listen. Let's go away before sunrise. - Where'll we go? - Anywhere Paro. We'll live under a tree, but not here. Collect whatever you can. Take whatever you can, and go. A six foot young man and such a small heart. So what if you lost your job. Get a new one. Buy new tools. Find a new seth. It's not so simple bhaiya. Our name's besmirched now. Why are you afraid of having a bad name? Won't the people find out that you didn't steal? If you fear anyone let it be God, not people. At least you'll get favors from him. God. Forgive me. Sethaniji. We know everything, Paro. The thief's been caught. Shankar, I'm sorry for misunderstanding you. And insulting you. I'm ashamed. My luck's bad. You all are privileged people. Saying 'I'm ashamed' is easy. Our lot ends up suffering. No, Shankar. I'm genuinely ashamed. I insulted you wrongly. I couldn't bear it when the real thief was caught. Forgive him Shankar. Your reward. That's not necessary. It's enough that your doubts have been cleared. Because of you we got back our jewelry. That's why I'm giving. - Tell him to take it. - No, Sethaniji. He's doing the right thing. So, this is your Bansi? - Give it here. - No, Sethaniji. Don't be stubborn. This is between the child and Sethaniji. Actually, he caught the thief. - Giridhari Bhaiya. - You be quiet ji. Please give it to him. Take it son. Shankar, meet me tomorrow at the factory. Paro, come to the bungalow tomorrow. Escort Sethji downstairs. Paro behen, God has set things right in your home. Now, my home? I'll set it right myself. Ma, take this. I'm so sleepy. Go, sleep. That shoeshine boy, dare compare himself to my darling son. That witch. Singing hymns in your dreams too? Hey, Mrs. I've come home. So what? Must I do your aarti immediately? Pick up that pillow. Sleep on that mat quietly. From today, you'll sleep on the mat and I on the bed. - I'm the head. - Don't talk nonsense. Have you gone crazy? I've come to my senses. Will you get up? Or... Has that witch Paro, bewitched you? Shut up! Stop bad mouthing people. I'll set fire. I'll kill. Don't insult me. I'm Devi. Worship me. Devi, devi, I'll worship you in a moment. Let me bring my devta. Where's my devta? Worship me. Tell him to forgive you. Devi says, go and sleep. Where are you going Devi? Wait here. I'll exorcise her. Go away, Devi. Exactly. That's right. So, the devi hasn't been exorcised yet? Come on Devta, set it right. Come on, my legs are tired. So much money? Buy your tools. It will fulfill a carpenter's needs. Rs 500? Do you agree there's a God? Paro, I don't know whether he exists... but your devotion is genuine. You are the provider You are the nurturer You are everyone's divinity If you desert us... then who will protect us? If you don't listen... then who will... to the words of a sufferer? Giridhari, the eyes are longing to see you
