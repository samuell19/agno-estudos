TWO CENTS FOR THE SUNSHINE, FOUR CENTS FOR THE RAIN. He is our salable hero... Don't worry. I will talk to you later. -Sir, I have written something new. -Wonderful! Let me hear it. "Once the rain is here... Once the rain is here... All the pain vanishes Once the rain is here... It's a new beginning In winter... In winter... I sell warmth... Little by little" Good. -"I sell seasons--" -Very good, Debu. But the problem is... you write sincerely. Come up with a contemporary theme. Write a flamboyant song. Do you know what everyone likes today? Come here and kiss me... Come here and touch me... Come here and love me... That's called a song. Sir, I want to convey something... through my songs. Yes, go ahead with it. But write something that will be played in an auto-rickshaw! I am going back home. Don't try to look for me. Let me go in. I stay here, as well. -Who paid the rent? -Yes. But... Your boyfriend. Who had the keys? Sameer. Yes, I'll talk about it. It is raining. Can I leave the suitcase... and the guitar here? Alright. Don't leave it here for more than two days. I got in first. I didn't see you. Now that you have seen me. Get lost. Well... but... it is raining. Just a minute! Where do you have to go? Where are you going? I see. You want a good time? Yes. But I will stop on the way for 30 minutes. Come on, Bankey. Let's go to our hotel. I am reaching, Sallu! Wait, sir. Let the rain stop. Do you have a condom? I am paying you for the job, right? I've told you many times before that I can't do without it. -Here you go. -Great! This is funny. You want to get wet in the rain but you want to wear a raincoat! If you want to come out in the rain, you'll have to wear a raincoat. Forget all this! If you're okay with AIDS, I'm okay with it too. Why do you scare me? I am here to stay. Anyway, you're going to enjoy it. I am not here for enjoyment. Are you wearing it or not? I'm running late. I have someone else is sitting in the taxi. I see. You've started a call-waiting facility, as well? -You've become very smart. -You rascal! -Would you like to hear some lyrics? -At your command! Wow! Which place do you belong to? Originally, I am from Lucknow. But now I belong to Mumbai. I see. "In the empty receptacles of my heart I found... some forgotten coins" "In the empty receptacles of my heart -I found some forgotten coins" -I found some forgotten coins" -"Sometimes... -Okay. sometimes you will find happiness" Is there enough place to sit? I had one... but now, I'll have to make some other arrangement. -Bankey... let's go home. -Yes, ma'am! Do you have money? Yes, I have 375 rupees! When the bank opens tomorrow-- Hey! What are you doing in my taxi? Throw him out, Bankey! -Bloody rascal! -Please get down, sir. We need to go. What did you do today? The maid didn't come today, as well? What's this? Didn't you eat your food? Why do you behave like this? Okay, stay hungry. I earn the money and you waste it! The cat is here again! Looking after you is already hard for me. I can't take care of this cat now. Let her go. Leave her. I don't want to see it in this house again. How are you Kaku? Is this the time to come? I went out and finished my chores. And you are coming now? He is hungry and thirsty. What can I do, ma'am? I don't have the time. The lady on the fourth floor has no maid at home. I work there as a substitute maid. Will you starve my child for your substitute job? Leave that job and work here. How can I leave that place? I get more money there. Do I not pay you? Stop your daily theatrics. If you want me to work, it's fine. Or else I will leave. Okay, go! Here's your key. Clear my account. I won't come from tomorrow. Even I don't want your daily theatrics! You can leave just now. Go! Who do you think you are? Don't come back. Do you understand? Don't ever ask me to come back. -I won't. -Okay. You think I can't do without you? Bihari! Bihari... this maid won't come here anymore. I need a new maid from tomorrow. But it's difficult to find a reliable maid. I'll look for one tomorrow. Hurry up! Find me one at the earliest. Okay, I will try. Sir, please place an order. The cafe will be closed in some time. I am coming. Here I am. Hold it. Eat this. Don't make me shout at you. -You needed a maid. -Yes! -There's one here. -Call her. Come! You? You're still here? I had asked for a maid not a male. A child has to be looked after. What will this Mr. Fantoosh do? Get lost! I'll do anything. I need work. This is Kaku. He can't do anything on his own. Neither can he bathe, nor change his clothes or go to the bathroom on his own. He needs to be carried to the potty-chair! Do you understand? -Leave! Get out! -Listen to me. Yes... I know. Where are you going? Why? Any problem? You think you own this hotel? Why are you stopping everybody? Not everybody... but I have to stop some people. Asshole! What is this, Sallu? He didn't let me in, bloody catamite! Where did you go? You told me to come to a five-star hotel in Bandra. That's where I am. Are you crazy? I didn't tell you to be at a five-star hotel. I told you to be at Hotel Five Star. That's what it's called. It's in Juhu. Forget it. I'll send someone else. How much will you take? Who do you think you are? What? What did you say? Damn you! She has also raised her rate. Hey... get the beer. He's so lazy to put his hand in his pocket! Hey! You're here again? Why are you speaking like me? Don't try to look for me. He ended a three and a half year relationship... in just three and a half lines. I can cook, handle the child and look after the house. You don't need to be worried. I am there. Unemployed. I have no money and I have no work. I just need a shelter. How can I trust you? Do I know you? I don't know who you are. What if you run away with my child? Kids are getting kidnapped nowadays. He who doesn't have a place to live... cannot kidnap your disabled child. What do you do? I am unemployed for now. -Okay. -Otherwise, I am a songwriter. I write songs. Film songs? Hey! Move. You're quite a guy! Which songs have you written? Well, I've written many songs... but none have come out yet. It is a matter of luck. Either the producer didn't like what I wrote... or the film got stalled. -Come on! Sing me a song. -Here? Yes! It's a perfect filmy scene. You're trying to bemoan your grief anyway. So, why don't you sing a song? I love old songs. Come on! The day somehow passes But night is endless You don't come, but... Your memories haunt me The day somehow passes The same drizzle and shower It was raining in the same way It was raining in the same way Is this all the luggage you have? I have another bag... and a guitar. I'll go get it. Please bring it to me. Come on in. -Yes, okay. -Come! Had a tiff with your girlfriend? What does she think of herself? -Don't worry! -What is this? He is just a child. He won't come in here. Come on! I can't do this. He has ruined my mood! Son of a bitch! Hey! What did you say? You're a son of a bitch. I will cut you up, if you say anything against my child! And don't you stare at me like this! Like your father! I have to do this for you! Had you not been born like this, your father wouldn't have run away! What's your name? Do you like music? I have a guitar... and I can play it. Would you like to learn? In the orchards of dreams Life will blossom If you seek You will find life again! You will find life again! In the orchards of dreams Life will blossom If you seek You will find life again! I'm coming! It's his signal when he wants to go to the potty. When he wants to pee, it's a different signal. We have different signals for every need. You'll learn it all. What a mess! How does she live here? I want tea leaves... tea leaves... In the empty receptacles of my heart I found some forgotten coins Just by chance You will find happiness If you seek You will find life again! If you seek You will find life again! Listen, please feed Kaku at eight o'clock. And put him to bed. He always stays up late. And before putting him to bed... make sure he goes to pee. Oh, my heart! It is difficult to survive here Stay off and be cautious This is Bombay... my love! Come on. On the solitary path of love Two strangers Two strangers Meet by chance Just like that You will find a smile If you seek You will find happiness If you seek You will find happiness What's this, Sallu? You're promoting new girls these days! What about me? I have a family. You know that I have a child. How will I survive without work? What's wrong with you? You do not understand it, Juhi. Your time is over. You look old! How long can I drag this? Who will give you so much of money? Reduce your rate and I will bring customers to you. 2,500 rupees for a good time. Fix it... come on. I won't work for peanuts. Got it? Don't hold yourself at a premium, Juhi! When I mention about you, the customer says, "Sallu, she is old stuff. Bring some fresh splendor!" Five thousand... is too much. You can get a young girl for that price. Yes, Vasu. Yes, I have. What do you want? Come on, say it. You will get it! Absolutely fresh! Everyone desires a young girl. The best girls are entering this line. Even homemakers... This is the best time in Mumbai! Even I need to make money, isn't it? Don't think that I can't manage without you? Do you understand? Who are you trying to impress with your language? I am the one who has been your mentor. Your time is over. You look old. How long can I pull you on? Who will give so much of money? When I mention about you, the customer says, "Sallu, she is old stuff. Bring some fresh splendor. Eat this. It is good for you. Take it... hold it. Shall I get you something? I'll get it right away. How much sugar will you take, ma'am? Don't make me uncomfortable in my home by calling me ma'am. Just say "you." You... is too much. -Don't you think so? -No, it's okay. -So, how much sugar will you take? -One teaspoon. A little bit more. I'll take it. Wait. Here you go. One minute. Take this. When you need to sit on the potty-chair, strum the guitar. He does not speak at all. There is nothing that he cannot express. Particularly, when it's something that he does not like. Right? From how long has he been like this? When he was born... he was like this. Oh, not again! It's not for the potty-chair. He wants you to open the window. Are you coming with me? What did you say? Should I slap you? Does your mother know you rove around here? But... I have money! Really? Have you become that grown-up? Get lost! Just fuck off! -I really have the money! -Damn you! Showing off money! Come on. Eat this soup. Hold it. What's it? Is there something in it? Have it. You don't want it? Isn't it good? Shall I get you something else? Will you have bread and jam? Should I get you some food? A samosa or a fritter? What is it? Do you want to go out? Yes! What is it? What? This cat? You want this cat? Here you go. Come. Debu... come and help me here. Lift it. Lift it! What are you doing? Why are you acting like girls? -Lift it. -Leave it. -Leave it. -What is your problem? Do you have a problem with a girl? Haven't you ever done anything with a girl? There is no problem. I see. What's the problem? You were crying for your girlfriend at the bar. It wasn't for my girlfriend. Oh, my God! For your boyfriend? I'm so stupid. So that's the problem. I see. Neither could I agree with beauty Nor was love of any use to me Are you mad at me? I was joking. I don't like such jokes. Fine, I won't make fun of you. I won't say a word at all. But seriously... have you never done anything with a girl? Do you want to try it? Go away! Debu! Kaku! What is this? -What happened? -Are you going to watch TV all day? No one is watching it! With a foul mood you enter Twirling and fretting On a lonesome, monsoon night! Why are the lights on? What's wrong with you? Why are you wasting all my money? The TV is on and the fan is on. And you keep writing all night with the lights on. Can't you write during the day? I can't write in the day. Please write during the day. Her body and hair is wet And she is crazy She meets a stranger In complete solitude Isn't it weird and wonderful? Wow! Brilliant! This song is final... but write something else. Or else... how will I present... this dazzling beauty? -This is just 5,000 rupees. -Keep it with you. You're writing the next six songs as well. Now you're one of us now. Cloud to cloud, Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Cloud to cloud, Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Come, let us get drenched Let's run away Come, let us get drenched Let's run away Cloud to cloud Let's walk the sky Come, let us get drenched Let's run away Come, let us get drenched Let's run away This world is temporal Happiness is transient Why grumble and grouse? This world is temporal Happiness is transient Why grumble and grouse? Sorrow is a treasured friend It is dear to us Why are you intimidated by sorrow? Cloud to cloud Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Come, let us get drenched Come, let's run away Debu... get me some tea. Kaku. Kaku. Kaku! Bihari! Bihari, I don't see Kaku and Debu anywhere? Don't worry! I'm sure they are around. He saw that I love writing. He said, "Son... do what your heart says." If you want to do something, you can do it. Give me a clap! Go take a nap! Forget it. You have never been close to Kaku. He's a child... he needs affection. Debo is giving him a lot of affection. You have not forgiven him... because his father left you. The cruel one gave me a look At the crossing That forced me to place my heart At the tip of a knife You've ruined my peace of mind Keep your eyes off me, O cruel one! You've ruined my peace of mind Keep your eyes off me, O cruel one! Distraught are the people of your city Distraught are the people of your city You've ruined my peace of mind Keep your eyes off me, O cruel one! Distraught are the people of your city Do show up Before I cease my languid stretch Do show up Before I cease my languid stretch Adorned with kohl are your black eyes Adorned with kohl are your black eyes Adorned with kohl are your black eyes Adorned with kohl are your black eyes My eyes Why is he wearing a lipstick? What's the problem? We're having fun. I'm entertaining him. Look... he is happy. Don't you care about his happiness? Don't tell me what my son means to me. You are in this house because of Kaku. Do you want him to become like you? A dancing queen! Remove it. Just get it off! Don't you ever do this again! What kind of a mother are you? You know nothing about motherhood. You're a bloody eunuch! What about you? Who are you? Well... what do they call you? Whore! You are a whore. It pierces through and through The amorous arrow of your eyes You've wounded my heart my love! I'm crazy for your love I'm crazy for your love I'm crazy for your love I'm crazy for your love -Ali. -Debu. -Do you live in this city? -Yes. What do you do? I am a lyricist. -Yes? -It's me! I might be late today! -Why? Have you found someone? -Yes! -Who will look after Kaku? -You. You can look after him for a day. You know I have to go out. This new friend... -What is that? -What? See. -Look at this. -I see. Show it to me. What's this? This... You haven't left yet? I changed my mind. Ali. Juhi. Have a seat. The magic of my eyes The magic of my eyes Has enchanted many of them Has enchanted many of them There are a lot of tales There are a lot of tales Related to my eyes Related to my eyes The magic of my eyes Has enchanted many of them You're not the only forlorn You're not the only forlorn Vexed in my love Vexed in my love I'm yours... Come on! I am saying sorry. I don't want to talk to you. I was mad at you. But I'm sorry. Please come out. You did what you had to. Don't touch me. Forgive me, I'll not make fun of you. I won't laugh at you and I won't touch you at all. Play it! You can be angry And I can appease you This attitude causes me To love you more This attitude causes me To love you more Few grouses and some complaints Few grouses and some complaints Add thrill to life Add thrill to life You can be angry And I can appease you This attitude causes me To love you more This attitude causes me To love you more Few grouses and some complaints Few grouses and some complaints Add thrill to life Add thrill to life If I get that kind of simplicity in my lyrics... "Why did You create puppets of clay... A beautiful earth and bright faces?" "Why did You create this world... With only a dash of youthfulness?" "You silently watch the show... Great is Your divinity! Why did You create this world?" -The writing was exemplary! -Shailendra. No, it's by Hasrat Jaipuri. "If you look into my eyes, I will ask you about the fate of love" "If you lower your eyes I will pay you a silent salutation" "In the shadow of your tresses I will attain the peace of my life" "I will traverse a journey of a lifetime In that special moment" Kaifi Azmi! Nobody else can write such a romantic song. "It is just a feeling... Experience it with your soul Let it be... Don't give it a name!" "I've seen the enchanting spark Of these eyes Don't let the world kill its magic By defining it" -Gulzar. -Gulzar. You remember all these old songs? How can I forget them? I've grown up listening to these songs. There is a story about Shailendra, the lyricist. Shankar and Jaikishan had promised to introduce him to a producer. Somehow, they forgot about it. But, Shailendra kept waiting. Finally, Shailendra sent them two lines written on a paper. And... Shankar Jaikishan created this famous song... It's a small world All roads are familiar We are bound to meet sometime We are bound to meet somewhere I'll ask you then How have you been? The moon is in a state of slumber In the unbounded sky I will spend a wakeful night Good! How will you be able to sleep? Who was your favorite hero? My favorite... Balraj Sahni. -Really? -What are you doing here? Shut up! If we could do something, why would we come out here? Wouldn't we be at home? -Come on... -Leave me, he is a bloody swine! I have another favorite... Guru Dutt. Do you know how many times I watched 'Pyaasa?' 17 times. Do you remember Kumkum? She was Waheeda Rehman's friend in the film? Her name was also Juhi! When did you... start this work? Are you going to give me a lecture? No, I'm just talking about it. If you want me to sob and tell you my story... This was an easy way and I grabbed the chance. That's all. It's been many years now. -Can you do something else? -What? Anything else! I mean... do you like all this? It doesn't matter. For how long will you continue doing it? Forever? Forget it! I don't about all this. This is the only work I have. That's all. Don't you respect your body? Will you just keep giving it to everyone? Body is a body! Come on. Why should I give it so much of importance? I just sell my body. People even sell their souls. Look at the state of that body! It turns to dust. Six hours on fire and six minutes in the oven. That's all. Hurry up! Come back. I want our child... to participate in the race. Really? This is a game, my dear. Not a joke. Come back. Hurry up! Let's run! Come back. Come on. Give me my money. I want my money! I want my money! Where are the three of you are running away? I won't leave you. Bloody hell! -I want my money! -Get lost! Hey! Wait! Mother fuckers! Bloody hell! You will rot in hell! Bloody hell! Juhi, what's your favorite dessert? What happened, Juhi? Where are you? Juhi... Cloud to cloud, Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Cloud to cloud, Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Come let's get drenched Let's run away... Come let's get drenched Let's run away... Come let's get drenched Let's run away... Come let's get drenched Let's run away... With an ecstatic heart We will ride the winds With an ecstatic heart We will ride the winds For once let's live unrestrained Even if tears well up Let's swallow them away... Cloud to cloud Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Come let's get drenched Let's run away... Come let's get drenched Let's run away... What is it? What happened? The cat is gone. Never mind, child. It will come back. Come, let's watch TV. In the empty receptacles of my heart I found some forgotten coins In the empty receptacles of my heart These lyrics... are mine. Do you remember this? These are my lyrics! What is this? They turned it to a sleazy, disco track. They didn't even ask me or tell me about it. They've ruined my song! Repeat after me. Repeat. Ma... Ma... Kaku! Kaku, what did you say? Did you say "Ma?" Tell me. Debu! My child said, "Ma!" Come here, Debu. Where is your mother, child? Did you teach him to say that? Kaku said "Ma." Where's your mother, child? Tell me. Where's your mother? Tell me, child! I was only trying to teach him... Kaku is right. I was busy playing a father's role. And I forgot to be a mother. I was in school. And I ran away from home and got married. My family was furious. They abandoned me forever. I dragged my marriage for seven years. I thought that having a child would improve the situation. But it didn't. When Kaku was born... my husband knew that the child was not normal. He ran away... from the hospital. He was never seen again. I didn't have the money... for the hospital. I cried on that bench for three days. A man was observing me from a distance. He said, "You can earn some money... but you'll have to go to the hotel for two hours." I went and got the money. So... This is my story. What is your story? My Dad was in the Army. His friends would visit us. They would talk about war. I don't know... when I was attracted towards them. When I think about it... Dad never gave me the affection I wanted. He never spent time with me. What about relationships? I am a traveler on the path of love Don't speak anything to me Whoever meets me with love I belong to them. I mean... I felt that... Nothing is permanent. Everything keeps changing. But the illusion of permanence... it makes you feel good. Aren't you lonely without Sameer? "Where you don't feel the difference Between sorrow and joy I have made my heart To come at that state Puff out every anxiety In smoke..." I wish I could say, that I have no regrets... But, if we have no regrets about anything... about our mistakes... and about our impulsive behavior.. then it looks like... life has not touched us at all. It is said that... our spiritual journey... is incomplete. I have one regret. I can never be twenty again! -Shut up! -All right. I have wrinkles. In the empty receptacles of my heart Look. I found some forgotten coins In the empty receptacles of my heart I found some forgotten coins What color should I use? Remove it. If you seek You will find life again Don't wear it. -Minimalism is in. -Really! You can seduce any man by being subtle. You? -No. Not me! -Why? Because my heart doesn't throb for a woman. It has started to throb Age has nothing to do with it. A woman can look beautiful at any age. Welcome, my compassionate one What is it? Be soft and gentle. Juhi, adjust your sari. -Enough. -Enough. There's no network here. Wait. Do you have a room in the hotel? Yes. Don't call me, ma'am. Let's talk business. Do you want a good time? Just a minute. I'll call you later. Ma'am. I... Why are you feeling shy, lad? -What are you doing? -What? Nothing. -Let's go! -What? Let's go. Right now. I'm trying to raise your standard, and you... This is a five-star hotel. It's not your perch! Work is work. Don't I have to run the household? Who will pay the bills? Who will pay the rent? -You? Will you sell songs? -Yes! I will sell songs. I write good songs. And the world will accept them. The producer liked my songs. You live in a bubble. Your songs are stupid. Write something about reality. Something unique. Do you understand? Let's make love, darling Listen to this! This song is a hit! The day you grab the attention of a common man... your songs will sell and become famous. I will continue to write in my style. And my songs will become famous. Fine! Your time starts now. Fine. -Sorry, my child! -Hold on. Come. Let's go. This is Debu. Yes, Debu. Tell me. I was passing by your office. I thought if I could just meet you. Don't be formal. You can meet me anytime. Okay, sir. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Oh, no! I am in a meeting now. Give me a call on Monday. With an ecstatic heart We will ride the winds For once Let's live unrestrained With an ecstatic heart We will ride the winds For once Let's live unrestrained Even if tears well up Let's swallow them away... Cloud to cloud Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Come, let's get drenched Let's run away... Come, let's get drenched Let's run away... He has come back, Juhi! -Who? -Sameer! He called me. Sameer? Like soft cotton Sweet talk Can fill the space In just a moment If you permit me For a few moments It will be like light It will be like life In the empty receptacles of my heart I found some forgotten coins Just by chance You will find happiness If you seek You will find life again! If you seek You will find life again! Will you go back to him? But he threw you out of the house and left you alone. When someone realizes his mistake... Why are you sad? He is going to meet his friend. He'll come back. He can't live with us... forever. He has his own life. -Are you making me look good? -Dazzling! Come on. Get ready now. I'm ready. -Are you wearing this? -What else? Wear something nice! I have just three shirts. Two of them are dirty. It is rainy season. And I need to wash them soon. I will bring you one. Wear this! Come on, smile. Debu. Debu... hang on. Give me a minute. Have a seat. I am getting married. The girl is from Chandigarh. I'm engaged. My wedding is in the coming month. Is that why you have called me here? I don't want anyone to know about... our relationship. I want a regular life. Children. Perhaps, I was alone in the city. This will never come out in the open. Debu! What happened? "Why should I fake a complaint? So, what if my heart is shattered? It was like a toy, made of glass. It's broken. It's lost." He did not come back for me. He is getting married... to a girl. I am not going anywhere. I will be here... with you. What is this, Debu? You're looking at his pictures again. Throw them away! Forget him. What's this? Listen to me, Debu. If Sameer lived with you for three years... and can start a new life with another girl now. What can't you do that? Because he is Sameer. And this is me. What's the harm in trying? No. Do it for real. Leave this idea. Nothing will happen. When you've never tried it with a woman, how do you know that nothing will happen? Look... when we met, we had our needs. You needed a shelter and I wanted a maid. But now, everything has changed. We have bonded. Kaku loves you so much. You love him too. Now the question is... about the two of us. You and me... Me and you... Yes! Kaku, you and me. After showering them With a pleasing fragrance When I first taste The prickly heat of the sun The hailstones of rain I keep to myself After showering them With a pleasing fragrance When I first taste it I carefully sieve And sell the cool silk of the shade After carefully sieving I sell the cool silk of the shade I sell seasons All year round I sell seasons All year round I sell seasons All year round All year round Welcome! O my loved one Be seated, O my beloved Be pleased To test my passion Be pleased To test my passion This darkness is cast By the silken tresses Don't be troubled Till you are allured By the fragrance of my tresses Come thus far! This darkness is cast By the silken tresses Don't be troubled Till you are allured By fragrance of my tresses Whosoever met your splendor Became thine I have surrendered myself to someone... Someone has become mine What did I see in you That I lost my heart Lost in such thoughts Night glided towards dawn Go wherever you may You can't but help look back You can't but help look back Wonder what you uttered Wonder what I heard A confab has been created Wonder what you uttered Wonder what I heard A confab has been created Wonder what you uttered Wonder what I heard Debu... What happened? Tell me. What happened? Tell me, Kaku. What happened? When it is not possible to bring a tale to an end, giving it up at an amiable juncture is appropriate. Some things are never meant to be. But... living under the same roof with you is difficult. You will have to live your life... And, I will have to find mine. I will miss Kaku and you. This world is temporal Happiness is transient Why grumble and grouse? This world is temporal Happiness is transient Why grumble and grouse? Sorrow is a dear friend Why should we get intimidated by sorrow? Cloud to cloud Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Nothing happened, the way I had imagined it to be. Get back to work. This is the only thing to do. This won't last forever. Use it, as long... as it works. I have a new number. I'll give you a missed call. Let me know. Cloud to cloud, Let's walk the sky Let's smolder with love Come let's get drenched Come let's get drenched Let's run away Come let's get drenched Come let's get drenched Let's run away Tell me, Sallu! Where do I have to reach? Nothing is permanent. Everything keeps changing. Yes, but the illusion of permanence... it makes you feel good. Juhi, you can do something else. Juhi! Where are you? -Where have you reached? -I'm here. I am about to reach. There is lot of traffic here. The customer has called me twice. Please try to reach as soon as possible. Don't you respect your body? Will you just keep giving it to anybody? Body is a body! Why should I give it so much of importance? For how long will you continue doing it? Forever? Forget it! I don't think that far! This is the only work I know! That's all! Juhi! How long does it take reach the hotel? I am in front of the hotel. I'm going inside. What is this? I'm trying to raise your standard and look at you. Work is work. Don't I have to run the household? Who will pay the bills? Who will pay the rent? You? Get back to work. This is the only thing to do. This won't last forever. Use it, as long as it works. -You can do something else! -What? Anything else! Juhi, are you there yet? Sallu, I won't go! What do you mean? I will not do this work anymore! What will you do? Anything... anything else. How are you? You know, Juhi... It's raining! Keep it away! Let me get drenched! -No! -What are you doing? I'm sure you will want to listen to the next song over and over again, and set it as your mobile ringtone. I am already in love with this song. The song has been composed by Sandesh Shandilya. And it's written by Devendra Prasad. However, the writer wants to be known as Debu. So, Debu... If you are listening to us... You're listening to 95.10 FM.
