Max, shut up! Kathy, can you get the dog, please? Hey, Max. - Your phone is ringing. - Yes, thank you. - Hi. - Out! Out! No, it's okay, I understand. Um, that's fine. Just get here as soon as you possibly can. Thank you, thank you. Okay. - Was that Fran? - Yeah, it was Fran. She got a jump start and she's gonna be here in 25. Oh, thank God. Okay. Crisis averted. I was supposed to be at work an hour ago, and... not exactly the tone I wanted to set on my first day back. I know. I just... Sorry, I gotta take it, it's Tom. Hey, Tom, is everything okay? What? Well... Yeah. No, I can be at the site in 20 minutes. I'll see you there. No. Nuh-uh. Where do you think you're going? I gotta get down to the building site. The inspectors are early. If we don't get the sign-off today, the whole thing will be held up. - What?! - I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do? - This inspection is important. - And my job isn't? Mark, I'm trying to show them that I'm ready to go back to work. Being two hours late on my first day is not the greatest of starts. You know, Philip kept on the woman that he hired to cover my maternity leave. It's like he wants a backup plan in case I crash and burn. Okay, Kathy, you're overreacting. Philip loves you. I'm sure Aisha will cover for you. But I gotta go. Bye-bye. Look, I'll call you this afternoon, okay? What time are you gonna be back? Well, I'll be here for lunch, but then... I-I don't know. What time were you home last night? Late. Look, we're gonna get better at this. - When? - I don't know, maybe around our third kid, fourth kid? Get out of here. See you tonight. Ah! Good morning. All right, so here are the proofs you asked me to get for your approval. - And the new hire portfolios? - All on your desk. You're a star. Did Philip notice that I'm not in yet? No. No, he hasn't said anything. He and Hannah only just got back from their breakfast debrief, - so I wouldn't worry. - Thank God. Hey. Welcome back. Thank you. So, how's little Billy, anyway? Isn't he just the best thing ever? Well, he's... he's pretty amazing, actually. Oh, God, I want one. Yeah, in ten years when I'm married and have my first million and I can just hire a nanny to take care of all the gross stuff. Smart girl. What's going on in there? Monday morning stand-up. It's another Hannah thing. - What's she like? - She's... nice. - Yeah? - Yeah, she's good, smart, has a good eye. - And you hate her? - Yeah, well, she's not you. Thank you. Needed that. I take it she drives a convertible? Yes. Yes, she's... - In my spot, isn't she? - In your spot, yeah. You want me to have it towed? No. No, I should meet her before I start sabotaging her. Well, you're a better woman than I am. All right, have a good morning. Gentlemen, thank you for waiting. Speak of the devil. This is my partner, Tom Cooper. - Nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you. So... how we looking? Few small items. Some extra fire extinguishers, exit lighting, and I'd like to see some sturdier railings installed. But otherwise, you're good to go. That's fantastic news! I'll get all this typed up and have the official report over to you this afternoon. Thank you. Appreciate it. What have we gotten ourselves into? Hey, Mark, this is a good thing. All we gotta do is turn a billion-year-old office building into modern luxury apartments... How hard could it be? Yeah, those famous last words. Sure you can't make it out with the client tonight? I told Kathy I'd be home early. Mark, it's your designs they fell in love with, bro. I'm just a number cruncher. They don't wanna hang with me. Besides, you went home early yesterday. Well, you know how wives are. My wife's cool. It's my girlfriend who's got trust issues. Will you settle for a celebration drink in the show apartment? You know I always love drinkin' on the job, baby. Maybe we can operate some heavy machinery after. Okay, so any questions about what's on everyone's plate for this week? No? Great. And one more time, just thank you so much for your long hours on the McCarthy campaign. They were thrilled. And thank you to Philip, our fearless leader. And also a big thank you to Hannah, who has done a great job as our interim COO whilst Kathy Hartman has... Well, how about that for timing? Whilst our beloved Kathy has been away starting her family. Welcome back, young lady. Thank you. I don't want to interrupt. No, no, no, no, we were just wrapping up. Unless you wanted to add anything? Uh, no. Uh, hi! Except that, uh, I'm thrilled to be back and I can't wait to see what we all come up with. - Then I guess we're done. - Yep. - Back to work, guys. - Thanks, everyone. No problem. I wasn't planning on coming in. It's so good to see you, too. - I'll see you in a minute. - Hi! - So nice to finally meet you! - Oh, you too! It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me everything about your baby. - Oh. - I want pictures. My baby is called Billy, and, uh... you want pictures? He's terrific. - Philip? - Yeah? Kathy's showing me some pictures of her baby! You gotta come see. Oh, my God, he's grown so much! I know, I know! Now, listen, guys, can we get to my office? We got a lot of work to catch up. Yeah? I mean now. Scoot. Thank you. Yeah. Oh. Oh, it's okay. Hey, Mark. I didn't know if you were coming home for lunch today, so I just went ahead and gave Billy his bottle. Don't worry about it. I can take it from here. I can take you from here. - Hey, buddy. - Here, he might need this. Okay, thank you. - Daddy's home. - Is Kathy still mad at me? Oh, trust me, she wasn't mad at you. Oh. Okay. Here we go. Everything okay with you two? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're good, we're good. How was your, uh, audition last week? Ohh. The worst. A hundred other actresses who look just like me all competing for a crappy scene with one line. I'm getting kind of sick of it, to be honest. Makes me want to move to New York. We're not gonna lose you, are we? Of course not! I wouldn't abandon my little guy. Oh! Ah, careful. You have to hold it up or else the air gets in. Actually, here, why don't you finish up here. I gotta get back to work in a minute. If I rush this, you're gonna be the one left dealing with a gassy baby. Oh. Okay, um, see you tomorrow? Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah. Hey. Hey, Billy. It's great having you back. We really missed you. At the same time, having Hannah here these last few months has been invaluable for the team. - The marketplace is changing. - Sure. And we needed to shake things up. Let me just cut to the chase. We need new business if we're gonna survive... big accounts. And to help manage that, I've asked Hannah here to stay on. I don't, uh... In what capacity? Well, you're the COO. I told Philip I wouldn't agree to work here if it was any other way. I'm sorry, I think that I must be missing something. No, I-I've asked Hannah to be the CSO. Chief Strategy Officer. The two of you can collaborate, challenge each other, and find new deep-pocket clients. And it'll give you some breathing room. Yeah, just think of me as another you. So you don't have to stress next time you want to be a couple hours late. Thank you. I think we're gonna make a great team. - Yeah. - Good. You know what we should do? We should go out to lunch. Just the girls. - Aw... - What is it? Oh, wow! - Thank you. - Who's she? Oh, that's... that's our nanny. That's Fran. Oh, wow, you're way more secure than I am. Having a sweet young thing like that walking around the house -just after you've been pregnant. - Sorry? I mean, not that you don't look great. I can barely even tell you've had a baby. I swim a lot, I don't know. Mmm. Good for you. I have the opposite problem. - I do no exercise. - Really. Yeah, my ex used to say that he'd prefer to have something to grab onto. He sounds charming. Mm. What he lacked in social graces, he made up for elsewhere. And what about your husband, what does he do? Hmm. Mark. He's an architect. Nice. Where did you meet? At a marketing conference. He wanted to charge his phone and I was standing in front of the only available outlet. So he fell right into your trap, huh? Hm, something like that. What about you? Well, I've got a guy, but it's complicated. Isn't it always? We started dating when I was living in New York, and since I've moved, the distance has been difficult. Are you sure you don't want one? Mm. I would love one, but I'm breast-feeding. Mark's from New York. - Really? - Mm-hmm. You know, I miss the city so much. Hmm. Anyway... enough about me. I want to hear about you and your family. Oh, we're really not that interesting. Oh, please. I'm so jealous of you. Jealous? You have this amazing baby... great job, and what sounds like a pretty terrific husband. I don't know. Trust me, you're very lucky. To having it all. Max! Max! Max! Shh! You're gonna wake Billy. Max! Max! Mark! Mark! You scared the crap out of me. - What's going on? - Max was going crazy at something. It was probably just a coyote or something. Billy's asleep? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty late. Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I had to do this thing with the Pleasant Getaways people. Should you be drinking? It's been a really long day, and I already pumped. I take it your first day back didn't go according to plan. He made her CSO. He did not! Mark. What is it? What is a CSO? Who's "her"? CSO, Chief Strategy Officer. And "her" is Hannah, the woman that I told you about. Got it. Philip wants us to work together from now on. Okay, so is that a demotion for you? No. No, he says I still have final say, but I'm sure she'll figure out a way to wiggle that out of him, too. - Maybe she'll help. - Yeah, help me right out of a job. They're not gonna fire you. No, they're just gonna keep her on. And she will slowly worm her way into everything until I'm irrelevant. Or maybe she'll make things easier. You don't have to do everything yourself. Ya know, being stressed isn't a badge of honor. And our glassware might even appreciate it. I'm not gonna have this conversation with you. - I'm just saying... - That you don't want me to work. No... No. Then what? I thought you said that you told Tom not to call you so late. I'm gonna... We're gonna need a vacuum in here. And some kitchen towels. Getting it. - All right, I'm heading out. - Okay. Bye, Mark. Have a good day. Everything all right? Yeah. No. I mean, yeah, just... growing pains. I was just wondering if I'd done anything to upset Mark? - Why? - Well... I just noticed he hasn't been coming home for lunch as often. He hasn't? Just a few lunches here and there, but... I thought you should be... aware. Fran? Uh-huh? Could I ask you to do me a favor? Sure. Anything. Have you seen my keys? I-I swear I put them in my purse. Maybe you left them in your car? - Maybe. - Mm-hmm. Chalk another one up to baby brain. On, no, no, no. I'll go look. Philip wants to see you. No, he knows that I have to take Digital for lunch. Yep. I told him and he didn't seem to care, so I just said you'd meet him there. Okay. He's probably gonna ask me why I haven't brought in any new clients yet. Why is new business suddenly your job, anyway? Three words: Hannah Van Dyke. It's not her job either, but she's already landed two new accounts. With all the client lunches she's having, she's probably only covering her costs. You know, this is gonna sound crazy, but I swear she's up to something. - I don't think it sounds crazy. - No? She's definitely got Philip wrapped around her little finger. They're joined at the hip or something. No, he's married. Oh, like that stopped anyone before. Well, it would certainly explain how she got the job. I looked her up online, there's really not much about her at all. Yeah, I wondered that too. Apparently, she had a stalker, so she had to take everything offline. - She had a stalker? Bizarre. - Mm-hmm. Right. Some girls have all the fun. Look, you go see Philip, I'll look for your keys. Okay. Thank you. Yo. - Wanted to see me? - Oh, yeah, come on in. What do you know about Pleasant Getaways? I know my husband is doing a new apartment building for them downtown. So why is it Hannah's the one telling me they're looking for a new agency? Mark and I don't really discuss work at home. Okay, well, maybe you could bend that rule for once and ask him to set up a meeting for us. Uh... of course. Yeah, of course, yeah. Um, I'll get right on it. Good. And Kathy, uh, when we get the meeting, I want you to work on the pitch with Hannah. That a problem? - Not at all. - Good. Thank you. - Can I help you, Hannah? - Hi! Is Kathy at lunch? No, uh, she's with the digital team. You want me to have her call you back? No, it's okay. I have a lunch meeting too. I'll catch up with her when she gets back. Would you give her these for me? - Sure. - Thanks. Hi, Kelly. Sorry. Hannah asked me to get some papers sent to her lunch meeting, but I don't have the restaurant name. Could you check for me, please? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. I don't seem to have a lunch on her calendar. I can call her and ask, though. No, no, no. That's okay, thank you. I can do it myself. Thanks. That's great. Just let me know what you think after you see the figures. - Cool. No problem. - Okay. Hey. Hey... hey. Do you have a minute? Yeah, maybe one. Okay, I'll make it quick. Um, Philip found out that Pleasant Getaways are looking for a new agency, and he wants me to get a meeting with them. You mean he wants me to get a meeting. Yeah. I know it's a lot to ask. No, no, it's okay. I'll talk to them. You will? Mark, thank you. Well, thank me after they say yes. Yeah, okay. Um, what time are you gonna be home tonight? Late. Don't wait up. Ohh. Okay. Thanks again. Hey. Hey. I've been looking for you everywhere. I found your keys. What's wrong? Are you okay? Hey. I just feel like I'm spinning out, ya know? Philip doesn't trust me anymore, Mark is... Mark's not around, and I just... I feel like I'm drowning. Maybe everyone is right, maybe I just came back to work too soon. No, no, that's not true. Look... do you want to be here? - Of course I do. - Exactly. So maybe you came back too soon, or maybe you didn't. But the Kathy I know wouldn't let anybody keep her from where she really wants to be. Yeah. God, if you were my therapist, I'd be sane. If I was your therapist, I'd be paid more. - Hey. - Hey. I already put Billy down. Yeah, I figured. Did you eat? No. Oh, my God, you're the best wife ever. So, I talked to my guy at Pleasant Getaways. He said they'd be happy to take a meeting. Oh! Are you serious? Thank you. That's great, that's great. I just, now I have to deal with Hannah. - Why? - Because Philip wants us to work together on it. - She still being... - Very nice, very helpful. - She sounds just awful. - I know. No, I feel like I should like her, but there's just something about her, just... just makes my skin crawl. I can't figure it out. You want me to go all "Papa Bear/over-protective husband" on her? No, not yet, but... I reserve the right to take you up on that offer at some point in the near future. Deal. Thank you. Mark? Yeah? You don't want the weird cow-dog? What about the cat with no arms? That one's always fun. We need to get you some building blocks. Okay, who's on the phone? Who's on that phone? Here ya go. Hey... Hey, Fran, can you, uh... take over? Thank you. Ooh. Sorry, I have to... get this. There we go. Hi. Uh, yeah. Just hold on a second. Okay, talk to me. I need good news. Where? Even better. Yes. No, uh, what do you mean? Yes, I understand that. I can't get away right now. Because I don't know how to explain a trip to New York. Yes, I understand, but... Yeah. I will, uh, see what I can do. All right, bye. Everything okay? Yes, fine. Uh, I have to get back to work. Do you mind giving him the rest of his bottle? Of course not. You head on back. Okay, thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Her name's Kathy Hartman. Kathy! Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy! Over here! - Friend of yours? - These really nice people, with really lovely, lovely, gorgeous uniforms, beautiful, won't let me in, and I've got a present for you. Please. I'm gonna take a moment. No problem. I'll go ahead - and hold down the fort. - Thank you. It's okay, it's okay. I'll take it from here. - Eddie. - It's so good to see you! How are you? You look amazing. There is no way that you've just had a baby. Eddie, what are you doing here? Can't an old friend just pop by and say hello? And I've, um... I've got ya a present. Are you drunk? It's barely past noon. I'm not drunk. I-I-I am celebrating. Hold this. This is it. This is the proof. - Proof of what? - Yeah. This is the publisher's proof of your novel? Yeah. Yeah. And I've, um, I've... I've made a dedication to you. Hang on. Look. Here. "To my Katherine, - "my muse, my love, my life." - No. No. Yeah. "I couldn't have done it without you. Love, from Eddie." I'm a published author, and I owe it all to you. - No, you don't, Eddie. - Yes, I do. I was a struggling, aspiring writer, and you're my great love, and you sustained me through the fallow times. No, Eddie, stop it. Listen to me, okay? This is really, really nice, and I'm so happy for you and all, but this is my work, and you can't just come around here like this. Well, I can always come to your home. Well, that's not gonna happen, obviously. I've done it again, haven't I? - Embarrassed you. Sorry. - Yeah. It's fine. It's... This is really great. Thank you. But I have to go to a meeting. Yeah, it's fine. Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah, well, apart from my broken heart... - Shh! I mean, everything, you know, is fine, fine. Really. I really do need to go. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Why is he always so fussy when it's my turn to put him down? Maybe if you had a little more practice... I'll be in my office if he wakes up. And get the dog off the couch. Kath, can you come here a second? What's wrong? You trying to tell me something? What's that doing there? That's... just what I was wondering. It was right here when I walked in. Who is he? It's Eddie, my ex. The writer? A few years before you and I met. You having a bout of nostalgia? No. I didn't even know that I still had this. - So you didn't put it here? - No. Maybe Fran. Why would Fran put a photo of your ex-boyfriend on my desk? I don't know. Maybe... you know, it fell out of something, or she just found it laying around. I don't know. What does that matter? - So you didn't put it here? - No. And you're not seeing your ex-boyfriend behind my back? Mark... of course not. I haven't seen him since we broke up. I'm gonna ask Fran about this photo tomorrow, and I'm sure she'll say that she was just looking for something and then she forgot to put it back. Okay. Okay. - I'll get that. - No, it's my turn. No, it's okay. Do you need anything else? Sorry, no, I'm fine. But I do want to say thank you for being so flexible while Mark's been so busy. Oh, not a problem. Yes, Fran? Um... you know how you asked me to keep an eye on things? Yeah, about that, I wanted also to say that I don't know what came over me, and can we just forget about it? Of course. But I... What is it? Well, I... I heard him talking about going to New York. And? I didn't hear anything specific, but... - Fran. - It didn't sound like a business trip. It sounded more... personal. New York? Just like now? Can't they just send Tom? Uh, no, 'fraid not. How long are you gonna be gone? Just a few days. I didn't know that Pleasant Getaways had an office in New York. Yeah, well, they do. Yeah, 'cause we've always been meeting with them at their offices here in L.A. Well, it's a big company, I don't have to tell you. - How's it going with them, anyway? - Okay, I think. Yeah. We have a few weeks to get the whole dog-and-pony show together. How are you getting along with your, uh, replacement? Oh. Well, you know, we haven't killed each other yet. That's something, I guess. So they wanted to meet with just you? Yeah, looks that way. And who is it exactly you're meeting with? Okay, what's going on, Kath? Why the twenty questions? It's just that, um, it's just that Fran said... Well, she basically thinks that you're having an affair. Wow. Yeah. What do you think? I don't know. Are you? - Are you? - Am I what? Ohh. "To my Katherine," my muse, my love, my life. I couldn't have done it without you. "Love, Eddie." Where did you get that? The kitchen table. Where did you get it? - I should have told you. - Told me what? Told you that he came by the office. He just stopped by the office and he dropped it off. - And? - And nothing. - That was it. - Really? Nothing is why you lied about looking at old photos of you and your ex, - why you lied about seeing him? - I did not lie about the photo. I find that very hard to believe. And what about you, huh? Late nights at the office, mysterious phone calls that you make in private? Sudden trips to New York? - You're being paranoid. - Paranoid? Yes. Paranoid. First you think this woman at work is out to get you, - Yeah... - and now you accuse me of having an affair. I'm going for a run. Max! Here, boy! Ran, thank you so much. I appreciate it. Uh, he'll be staying at the Hotel Lexington, and the number is on the fridge. Okay, thank you. Sorry. Thank you. Bye. Um, sorry, I was... My husband has gone away on a last-minute business trip, so I'm still trying to organize childcare. No worries. You have a lot to juggle. These are the charts that I was telling you about. It's Pleasant Getaways' budget, bill rates, and resources. I was thinking that you could do the content section. I will do the finance stuff and strategy, and then Philip can just bring it on home. Works for me. I'm not really a numbers person anyway. Okay. Uh, so Hannah, I was thinking that I can put the deck on the network tonight, and then you could put your slides in tomorrow. Oh, actually, I can't do this week. That's what I was coming here to tell you. I have to go out of town for a couple of days. I have a lead on a client in New York, and I have to strike while the iron's hot, so... I'm leaving tonight. Uh... um, sure. Well the presentation isn't for another few weeks, so... I'll be back in a couple of days. Great. Plenty of time. Keep up the good work. Voicemail: Hey, this is Mark. Leave a message. Hey, so, fifth message now. I'm not even worried anymore, I'm angry. I really needed someone... I really needed someone to talk to. Thank you for that. That was, uh, it's lovely. I like your place, too. I mean, it's not as posh as my first flat, of course, you know, the one with all the charming wildlife. Oh, you mean the roaches. Yeah, that was really, um, I... I remember that. Shall I open another bottle of wine? Do you trust me? Yeah, I trust you. Enough for one more glass. Wise woman. Are you having a nice time? Give... Give me that. Give it to me. No, no, no. Hey! I'm fine. Perfectly capable of opening a bottle of wine. Go on, then. La voila. What shall we drink to? I don't know. What do you... What do you, um... How about, um... marriage and motherhood? - Marriage and motherhood. - How is it? This... This... This wife-and-mum thing? Well, it's challenging. Did you think it was gonna be easy? No. No, I didn't. Well, I didn't expect it at all. So how d'you think I felt? One minute you were breaking my heart, and the next I'm being told that you've got yourself a nuclear family starter kit. It all happened really fast. You know that I was pregnant on our third date? - Really? - Yeah. So we didn't do the whole normal getting-to-know-you thing. It was just like, "Hi." "Oh, nice to meet you. I'm having your baby. Let's get married." Are you okay, Kathy? Yeah, I'm fine. No, you're not fine. Kathy, you're not fine. D'you know how I know that? - How? - 'Cause you called me. What are you doing? What? I should go. You've got a really, really great life, Katherine. You have. I'm not gonna screw it up for you. See ya. Hello? Hello-o-o? Oh, hey. Hey. Good morning. Are... Are you okay? Um... Oh, God. Yeah, I was just... - Oh. Don't worry. - I guess I must have... I've been know to have a glass or two myself. Your secret's safe with me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Billy?! - Mark, I'm so sorry. - - Kath, you need to tell me what's going on. I-I swear I didn't leave the door open. I... There are three wine bottles in the recycling, Kathy. I mean, you drank enough that you passed out on the couch for hours. Enough that you left the back door open. - What if it had been Billy? - Don't. What if it had been? Maybe you need to talk to someone, a professional. - No! This is not about that! - You haven't been yourself in a while now... Neither have you, either. Okay? You've changed too. - Kathy. Kathy... - I had a little too much to drink, but that door was shut. I know it. I know it. So how did it happen, then? Huh? Explain it to me, Kathy. I would love to hear an explanation as to how this happened, other than you got so drunk that you didn't notice our dog fall into the pool and drown, so drunk that it could have been our son and you wouldn't have even noticed. Yeah. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. No, no, no, don't... Don't tell me. - Another lunch meeting? - Yep. - Unbelievable. - Mm-hm. Nobody can have that many lunches. - What can she possibly be doing? - I don't know, but she's up to something. What do you mean? She doesn't keep any of her meetings in her diary... - Uh-huh. - She won't even let any of the assistants keep her schedule for her, she insists on doing everything by herself. She's either the most self-sufficient exec in the history of marketing, or she's hiding something. Listen, whatever it is... it's getting in the way of the Pleasant Getaways pitch. You know, she was supposed to have the design comps by Monday, I still have not seen them. What are you gonna do? I've gotta talk to Philip about it. I am all for team spirit, but this... she's bringing the project down. Okay, well just tread lightly. You know she's the teacher's pet now. Yeah. We'll see how long that lasts. What's this? What's this? Who's that? Who's that? Okay. Hartman residence. Hi. I'm lookin' for Mark? I'm sorry, he's not at home. Can I take a message? Is this Fran? It's Tom. Oh. Hi, Tom. How are you? I'm good, I'm good. But look, I really need to get ahold of Mark, and he's not answering his cell. He mentioned he might be going home for lunch. Oh. No... he called a little while ago and said that he had an urgent meeting and couldn't make it home. Maybe he got pulled into something last-minute. Hey, look... - if you hear from him, would you have him call me? - Absolutely. I can't keep going round in circles on this with you, Kathy. But she just isn't delivering. Everything she's given to me has been detailed, thorough, and punctual. Then she must have a split personality, because with me, she is... She's always late and she is... she's sloppy. How's everything at home? Sorry? With the baby. How's it going? It's... uh, it's fine. Is it? Only I heard about the dog. Who told you? Doesn't matter. It was Hannah, wasn't it? I said it doesn't matter. Yeah? It matters to me. What matters is if your personal life is affecting your work. What are you suggesting? Well, you have to admit we didn't have these kind of issues before... Before what? Before... you... went away. Wow. No. We didn't have these kinds of issues before Hannah got here. This has nothing to do with Hannah. Do I need to be worried about my job? The Pleasant Getaways presentation is next week. I suggest you worry about that. Okay. Thank you. Mark? Is everything okay? Yeah. It's... Uh, where are you? I'm at work. What's going on? - Is Billy okay? - He's fine, I just wanted to check whether you're coming home for lunch today or not. No. Like I said, I have a meeting. Are you sure everything's all right? Yeah, of course. We're all good here. Good. Okay, well... I better get back. Yep. Sorry to bother you. How was your lunch meeting? You spoke to Fran. I had some questions about the joiners, but you weren't answering your cell, so I called the house. - Right. - Look, I cover for you, and Lord knows, I'm not one to judge. But your little side chick thing you got going on is starting to interfere with the work. - I'm not cheating on Kathy. - Then what is it? 'Cause it sure as hell is something going on with you. - I got it under control. - Mark. If you had it under control, we wouldn't be having this conversation. So it is a woman. Yes. But not the way you're thinking. Her name is Susan, and I think she might be dangerous. We dated a couple years ago. Define "dated." I didn't think it was that serious. She wasn't the kind of woman to be tied down. She was... this force of nature, ya' know? Wild. Carefree. Unpredictable in all the best ways. I dated an unpredictable girl once. She set my car on fire. Yeah, that's Susan. She got jealous whenever I even talked to another woman. Constantly accusing me of being unfaithful. We had these... huge, screaming fights that would get bigger and bigger until she actually came at me with a knife. Jesus! How'd you get out of that one? I left. I left her, I left my job, I left New York, came out here to... start over. But that wasn't enough. Let me guess. Little Miss Unpredictable decided the knife fight was just a misunderstanding and she wanted you back. Had to change my number. Email too, of course. So what did Kathy make of all of this? - You didn't tell her. - No. But this Susan woman was before you even met Kathy, so what's the problem? I saw her once in New York... after I started seeing Kathy. Saw or... saw? Got it. And I suppose Kathy doesn't know about that, either. It was before I knew Kathy was pregnant. I mean, we... We'd only just met, really. And now it's been going on too long. I thought it had gone away, I mean, I didn't... hear from her in months. But then Susan's mother gets in touch with me right after Billy was born. She was looking for Susan. Apparently, she just disappeared, didn't show up at work, walked away from her apartment and all of her stuff. Maybe she walked into the Hudson. Yeah... that's what I thought too at first, but then I received that photo in the mail. So what's with all the creepin' around? Kathy's been having kind of a hard time, and I didn't want to... add my mistakes to the mix. I have been looking for Susan. Calling friends, coworkers, hired a couple of private investigators. I even went to New York last week to chase down a lead. I mean, I... I need to find her before she... I love my wife. I love my son. I can't let anything happen to 'em. Good morning. Is Kathy in yet? No, she actually stopped by the printers on her way in, so she'll be about a half hour or so. Okay, good. So she won't mind if I borrow you for a minute. I have a meeting with Philip in five, but I left some donuts in the car. No one's in yet, would you mind going down and getting them before everyone arrives? Uh, sure. - Oh. Now. - Yeah. You're a lifesaver. Thank you. So what we really want to go for with both the content and the creative is right there in your company's name... "Getaway." Get away from whatever's stressing you out, whatever's weighing you down... Just get away. Thank you. I know, I know, I get to do the boring numbers bit. But if you look at what we're proposing, I think you'll find the numbers very interesting. Yes? It doesn't add up. Sorry? I-I'm just looking at the chart, and it appears the numbers don't add up. Uh... no. No, that's not, um... Is there a problem, Kathy? No. Sorry. Um... - Just give us a minute. - Sure. - Hannah. - Oh. Yeah. Just... one minute. What did you do? What are you talking about? Those aren't my numbers. I don't know what to say to you, Kathy, all I did was add my content slides. I didn't touch your part of it. Ohh. Everything all right, ladies? I'm sorry, we seem to have a bit of a mix-up here. But if you give me five minutes I can go get the correct information. Look, you know what, why don't I just speak to it? I think I have a pretty good grasp of the financials. - I thought you weren't any good with numbers. - Why would you think that? Because you said that to me. Okay. Okay, Kathy, you go get the updated information. Hannah, I'm gonna get you to field some questions. Get to it. Kathy, is everything okay? - Can I help? - It's the numbers. My part of the presentation is all wrong. Uh, no, you checked over that like a million times. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Can you bring up the file that we sent to Hannah on the transfer share, 'cause I... I swear she must have changed it somehow. No. No, no, no! That's not right! That's not... This is not my version. Um, this is the latest file. I... Are there any other versions? No, it doesn't archive like that. Okay. Okay. Can you close out of this, so then I can get in. I'm just gonna have to redo this from my notes. Yeah, we'll see you very soon. Thank you. You nailed it. She covered everything. You should be kissing her feet. She really saved your ass in there. - Shall we see 'em out? - Sure. Aisha. What are you doing here? Looking for you. What's so funny? Nothing. I just heard a good joke. Oh. Was it the one about the backstabbing agency executive who tried to sabotage her coworker, but wound up getting caught? What are you talking about? The file you updated at 8:56 a.m. I don't have time for this. You called me away from my workstation at five minutes until nine. I checked the logs, and the file was updated at 8:56 a.m. I was going downstairs to your car to get donuts. So if I didn't do it, then who did? I don't know what you're talking about. You know, I haven't liked you since day one. It's gonna give me a great deal of pleasure watching you get fired. I thought of another joke. Did you hear the one about the assistant who thought she could fly? Dr. Lawrence, dial 182, please. Dr. Forrest, please dial 118. Here. Thanks. - Any word? - No. I mean, will they even tell us anything? - We're not family. - I know, but her mother spoke to the doctor and said until she gets here tomorrow, she's gonna keep us informed. Great. Oh, God, this is terrible. The nurses just told me she's still unconscious. Horrible. Please. What? I saw you. The real you. Cold, manipulative... - Kathy - Philip, she changed the presentation. - I am telling you. - I cannot believe you're bringing this up again. - Right now?! - Philip, you're really... - Aisha could have died today. - Philip! I need you to believe me. I honestly don't know what I've done to make you feel this way. All I've tried to do is help you. You believe this? Huh? This act? That is enough, Kathy. Philip, she is manipulating you! I said that is enough. Why don't I take Hannah out to go get a cup of coffee. Let you compose yourself. It's been a long day. C'mon. I swear, next thing you know she'll be accusing me of pushing Aisha down the stairs. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, it's okay... it's okay. - Did you talk to Kathy? - I'm doing down there now. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - Why wouldn't it be? I just wouldn't want her to get any more upset than she already is. Why would me being there upset her? Fran? Is that Kathy? Is Aisha okay? Mark? What's going on? Hi, Mark. It's Susan. I can't talk right now, but I really want to hear your voice. So please... leave a message. You have one new message. I'll wait here. Any news? Yeah. Yeah, the doc's just letting Kathy see her now. - She's awake? - Well, not totally. But she's starting to come 'round. God, that's wonderful. I hadn't expected her to recover so soon. Yeah, she can't come back soon enough, if you ask me. I mean, I can't rely on Kathy. And I need to be sure that this client dinner goes smoothly. Client dinner? Pleasant Getaways are a family business, so they want to get everyone together to have a whole dinner thing to seal the account. - Everyone. - Yeah. You, me, spouses. We might finally get to meet this mysterious boyfriend of yours. Maybe. When is it? A week Friday. Philip... we need to talk. - I don't know. She's... - Philip. She's very upset, so who knows? - Philip. - I'll call you back. Is Kathy here? She's not answering her phone. She left about 20 minutes ago. Left me to clean up her mess. - Where'd she go? - Hannah resigned today because of Kathy. She said she couldn't take the paranoia and accusations, and I can't say... Where. Is. Kathy? Thank you. She went back to the office to pick up some stuff for Aisha. - Aaaah! Oh! - Oh, Kathy. Kathy. Kathy. Thank God you're okay. Why... What the hell are you doing here? There's something I have to tell you. - Can this wait? Can it wait? - No. I had the longest day, and I just want to go home. No. No, it really... it really can't. What is it? What? Mark? You're freaking me out, Mark. Is this... the Hannah? Yeah. Mark, what is it? This woman's name isn't Hannah. It's Susan. Susan Mulroy. She was my ex in New York. The woman I saw right before you. Now, I hadn't heard from her in months... and recently she started sending me photos. I didn't understand at first. In fact, I've been trying to find her. Now, I wanted to tell you... Kath, I wanted to tell you... Kathy... Kathy, Kathy... So, the party should be done by 10, so we should be home by 11, give or take. That's fine. You and Kathy just go and have a good time. - Lord knows you need it. - Yeah. Uh, Mark? I just wanted to say I'm really sorry... Sure. Listen, I understand. Um, set the alarm after I leave? I hate that thing. It's like it watches your every move. Yeah, that's pretty much why we got it. Please set the alarm. Aye, aye, Cap'n. Okay, thank you. And you've got our numbers. If you're worried, just call the security company, they'll send someone out. We'll be fine. Go. Wave bye-bye. Bye-bye, Daddy. Bye, Billy. - See ya. - Bye. 'Cause he kinda covered all bases with this stuff initially, but basically I don't want it to run out tonight. If someone asks for something super rare, - you can customize it, and make it a thing. - -Kathy! The very woman I'm looking for. You look fantastic. Thank you. Mmm. Is there anything I can do to help? Nope. I think that we have got it all under control. I can't tell you how much I appreciate all of your work on this, really. Thank you, Philip. And I have to say again how... - very sorry I am about everything. - Of course. I don't know how she did it, but she fooled us all. Except for you, of course. I'll... let you get to it. Our guests should start arriving any minute now. - Place looks great, by the way. - I know. I also wanted to say that it's kind of a mixed group here, there's gonna be a table at the back where they're kind of establishment, some people might want... I'm so sorry, Kathy! Sorry. Eddie. What are you doing here? You... You invited me. - Nnn... - No? Not you? Okay, so not you, your husband's crazy ex who keeps trying to stitch us up for an affair. Brilliant. Oh... Ahh. This is the last thing that I need. So what, she's still out there? - Haven't found her yet? - No. She cleared out of her apartment, she disconnected her phones, there's been no activity on her credit cards under either name, and they think that she might have gone back to New York, but they haven't found her yet. Well, until I hear otherwise from you, I'm gonna assume that every invitation is a counterfeit from now on. How embarrassing. Sorry. I'll, um, I better go, I suppose. Stay. We've had some last-minute dropouts and we've already paid for the alcohol, so it'd be like a shame to waste it. And... Well Mark's ex has caused us enough grief, I think he can suck it up for one dinner. - Right. Right. - Yeah. Well, right. I'm looking forward to this now. Yeah. - You made it. - Yes, I made it. How are you holding up? Gonna have to surgically remove this smile from my face. If it's any consolation, it's a great smile, fake or otherwise. - Before you say anything... - Okay, what is he doing here? Before you say anything, I said... your ex invited him. What?! Okay, we should call the police. - Can we not? - Kathy, I think they need to be made aware. We can do it in the morning. Can we just not let her ruin this evening? No, of course not. And I promise not to make a scene with your boyfriend. Promises, promises. Get me a drink. Diet Cola. That I can do. Sorry, can I get a cola? And a tequila. Yes. System disarmed. Alarm active. - You okay? - I'm a little nervous. Mmm, it's gonna be great. - Are you ready? - Yes. Let's do this. Good evening, everyone, and welcome! Thank you, and thank you for coming out tonight. Before I let you get back to the wonderful food and drink, I'd like to have the person that brought the Parr Collective and Pleasant Getaways together to say a couple of words. So would you please welcome our incredibly talented Chief Operating Officer, Kathy Hartman. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. We are thrilled about this partnership... And not just because we think that we're gonna get free hotel rooms out of it... Thank you... thank you. - Thank you for your work, for your business... because we're more than just an agency... we're a family. And nothing is stronger than family. And that includes the family that we get to choose. So... thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your evening. - Kathy, you nailed that. - Thank you, Philip. Kathy, that was beautiful. It was better than I could have written. Did you say something to Mark? N-No. Why? This is Mark Hartman. Leave a message after the beep. Are you okay? Um... sorry. Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. Fran is not available. At the tone, please record your message. Katherine, what's the matter? I've gotta get home. Do you have the number for a cab company? No, you don't need a cab. I'll take you. - No, Eddie, I can't. - No, you can and you will. Basically, it's your fault that I'm here, anyway, so you can't just wander off and abandon me. Come on. Let's go find him. Fran! Fran? Susan? You're just in time for dinner, honey. Our EMTs are taking your Ms. Hooper to the hospital. We believe she may have been poisoned. Your friend Mr. Kane has filled me in on some details, but I do need to ask you a couple of additional questions. Okay. You and your husband had issued a restraining order against this, um... Susan Mulroy? Yes. And your husband had previously been romantically involved with her? Yes. I have to ask, ma'am. Is there any chance... he could be complicit in the abduction? Absolutely not. Isn't our baby beautiful? - Isn't he? - Yes, Susan. Yes, he is. Our beautiful little baby boy. That's right, yeah. Can, uh... can I hold him? Daddy's been at work all day. Ya know? I miss him. No, you haven't. You've been with her. Give me the baby, Susan. No. Susan. Give me the baby. You see what you made me do? You should have chosen us, Mark. We could have been a happy family. You haven't seen Kathrine, have you, anywhere? No. She must be here somewhere. Ohh. - Eddie. - Kathy, where are you? Did you leave? Yeah. Eddie, I got a text from Mark. Or I thought it was from Mark. Eddie, I think he's in trouble. Okay, so where are you? I'm heading to the Dane Hotel, downtown. Well, I'm gonna meet you there. - Eddie? - Yeah? The text said not to tell the cops. Okay, I understand. Bye. Mark. Mark? Mark? Mark? Hannah? Susan? Hello, Kathy. Where's my son? Billy is safe. What do you want?! I want my life. You stole it... and I'm gonna take it back. Just tell me where my baby is. He was never supposed to be your baby! You know, I didn't realize it until now. I thought it was my fault. I thought I pushed him away. And then I found out how you trapped him. I mean, getting pregnant so he couldn't leave you? - That's pretty insane. - It wasn't like that. Wasn't it? Well, you and Mark certainly didn't plan to have a baby. Mark never wanted children, he told me that. With all your lies... you couldn't know him like I do. My lies? What lies? All of them! You're pretending to be this incredible professional and this great mom and this great wife, but you aren't! You're nothing. And I've shown him that now. Aaah! No! Uhhh, uhh! You know, I hate to say it, but we're a lot alike. Our careers always came first. And then one day... you find out you're pregnant... and everything changes. Mark and I would have had such a beautiful baby. But now... we have a second chance. We're going to make such a wonderful family. What's it like... knowing that you had a chance at happiness... and you let it slip away? Aaah! Unhh! - Aaah! - Ohh! Aaah! Uhh! Aah! Uhh... Billy's gonna grow up to be a great man... because now he has the mother he deserves. And Mark can have the wife he always wanted! Ohh! Uhhh! Ahh! Uhhh... Uhh! Uhh! Uhhh! Uhh! Oh, Billy. Mark? Mark. Mark. Oh, my God. - Mark. - Kathy. - Susan. She's here. - No, Mark, it's okay. It's okay. She's gone. She's gone, and she can't hurt us anymore.
