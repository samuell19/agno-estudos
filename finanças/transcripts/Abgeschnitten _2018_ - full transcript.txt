As many of you already know, the hospital was heavily damaged by the storm. The roof almost blew off. We had to cut back on power. Which means we are unable to ensure any medical care at the moment. We should listen to the Coast Guard warnings and leave the island early tomorrow morning. [SAVE YOURSELVES!] They have a ship docked and waiting. After that we're cut off from the rest of the world for at least a couple of days. ♪ I can feel right now, I can feel right now ♪ ♪ When you come and give me a knife ♪ Yo! I'm Tom and doofus here is Klaus. Hello Tom, hello doofus. Sorry guys, but I gotta work. Yeah. We thought you might need a break and that we'd buy you a drink or two. It's like this, man: If you look around there aren't that many of 'em here. - Tourists? - No! Not tourists. Hot babes, there aren't many hot babes here. Oh, got it. Thanks for the update. - What is it? - Sorry guys, but uh... Why don't you guys go back to your corner and practice a little more, yeah? - Yo? - Jesus fuck, Clemens! He has my number. - Danny's got my new number. - Sure about that? He just texted me, the fucker. Fuck! OK. It sucks, Linda. I'm sorry. How come he can find me! Fuck! Just chill for a second. It doesn't mean he knows where you are. How are you supposed to know that? He managed to find my number. - Wait a minute. Can he trace this call - Linda, cut it out! - on my phone? - No he can't. We turned geolocation off. Not gonna happen. Danny ain't the friggen NSA. Whatever. I need a new SIM card. Can you send me one? Maybe it's time for you to come home and deal with this. Cause your lawyer's like, if you're not willing to testify, nothing's gonna happen. You been talking with my lawyer? Without me? - You fuckin' lost Danny... - No, we got him covered 24/7. He's at home, I got two guys parked across the street. Listen up, little sis. You been on that island for three weeks now. How long do plan on being there? No idea, Clemens. Just ask fuckin' Danny. Fuck! How did she take the news? I didn't tell her, sounded like she was panicking Yo, G, I swear to God, I have no idea how this asshole managed to lose me. No fuckin' idea. We're gonna find him. And then we'll make spaghetti of his fuckin' brain. Danny is far far away. He won't be able to find you. Even if he did, he can't get here. You're on an island in the middle of a hurricane. Linda! Linda! Linda. Linda. Hello! Come on, that was a joke! Hey, where are you? Don't be afraid! Hello! It was a fuckin' joke! Hello! Dude! She took a pretty big fall! How was I to know she was gonna go all stunt-bitch on us? What's her fucking problem? So what're we gonna do? Let's get out of here. No one knows we're here anyway! What if she got injured or something? She didn't. You saw her, she ran away. Stop being a fuckin' idiot and leave her shit here! My client has already acknowledged that he tripped over a dog. He tripped? That's good. He was kicking the dog with steel-toed construction boots. Was it your dog, Professor Herzfeld? How is that relevant, if it was my dog? Can you instruct your client that he is required by law to answer my questions. Yes, it was quite obviously not my dog. Apparently the owner was shopping. Were you angry, Mr. Herzfeld? - This dog was gestating. - No. The report from the vet states it was overweight. Fat, not pregnant. If my client conjectured that said dog is pregnant, such a conclusion was certainly warranted. Were you infuriated about something? Why are we talking about me, for crying out loud? He kicked a pregnant dog in the stomach! Okay? If you wouldn't mind standing up for a second. Please, just get up for a second. You too. Professor? Do you truly believe that you could beat my client in a fight between the two of you? Probably not in every eventuality, no. But in this dispute? Wasn't it more likely that my client was surprised - by your sudden attack? - No! That's not the case. What happened on this morning, Professor Herzfeld? What made you so angry that you felt vindicated breaking my clients nose, six ribs... This man kicked a pregnant, defenseless dog in the stomach and he didn't just stumble, cause before that he yelled "out of my way". Your Honor, forgive me, I am trying to shine a light on the situation leading up to this dispute. What happened previously, professor? Tell us. But going skiing is about the only thing we still do together. It's like a tradition. On top of that I already booked us a cabin. So like, you can bring your girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend. Wait a minute, this is right out of left field, is this your mother talking to you or what? Yo, well, whatever. Mom is flying to Australia with Norman and I finally got the apartment for me alone. Chrissi and Lena are gonna move in and we're gonna study for our finals. Cause it's like... Skiing, really? Hannah, we haven't seen since September it feels like. At Christmas you didn't show up. Time is speeding by and I just have the feeling... I have no idea what's going on with you. What do you wanna know? What's going on in school? Did you pass your driving test? Have you met a boy? Mhh, it's cool, it's cool, and... not really, no. - Hannah? What's going on? - What do mean by that? Our conversations never exceed the realm of small talk for years now. You don't know your daughter? Maybe you shouldn't have left us years ago, Papa! There was another... One of these days... Dad, big friggin' dad! One of these days you'll tell me your side of the story and we'll hug and kiss, and live happily ever after. I'm mega-busy with my finals. Thanks for breakfast. Hannah, just wait a minute please, will you? Hannah! Would you like the bill, sir? Help yourself. Hannah? Hannah! Shut the fuck up! - Hey, you fucking asshole! - What you sayin', faggot? - Mr. Herzfeld? - Ehm, the answer is no. No, I was not furious. I was in a very good mood. Sorry for calling, but if there ever was a case for the boss, this one's it. No problem. My appointment was a waste of time. What do we know about the corpse? Female. It was found in a park along the river. In a moving box. A homeless person found it, who described it really well, and I quote: - "Looks like someone sucked the air out of her head." - Mm-hmm. I know what he means. Do we still have the moving boxes? It's still over at forensics. Thank you. The deceased is a Caucasian woman with an approximate age of between 50 and 60. Parallels between the ambient temperature where the body was found and the rectal temperature as well as the manifestation of rigor mortis indicate that the time of death was a maximum of 48 hours but maybe as little as 36 hours ago. Both of the rexar as well as the mandibular were seemingly separated after the cutis and the subcutaneous tissue were detached evidently with a coarse-toothed saw. Both hands were cut by force from the lower arms in all probability to hide the identity. Yup, I have to hand it to them. Someone knew exactly what they were doing here. What's the reading on the CT? It says foreign object in the cranium. Wouldn't be the first bullet to the head this week. That's not a bullet. Lack of blood aspiration in windpipes and lungs. The external injuries are post-mortal. Well that's something. Just imagine that she was still alive. Can we please do the stomach content? Oh, I'm too late! Really sorry about that. And you are? Ingolf von Appen. An honor, Professor Herzfeld, that I can meet you personally. Thank you for allowing me to be a guest student on these premises to observe you. I'm really honored. Don't bother thanking me. You seem to have friends in high places. It's seldom the president of the federal police call to recommend a guest students. The stomach has 140 milliliter gray-whitish... comma, with a milky appearance, comma, mealy, fluid content with sharp acidic odor. - Oh yeah! - Are you doing okay young guy? Uh, oh yeah 'course. It's all cool. - I'm astounded that there's no like music here, err, whatever. - Music? Yeah, music. Stomach content is gonna have to be analyzed. Likewise these crumbed elements here by the opening of the small bowel. But let's first take a brief look at the cranium together, please. What uh... actually happened to this woman? Whoops! I'm really sorry about that. Stop! Please don't touch your face with them. Whatever this woman has could be contagious. Oh, right. Of course. You know what? I know how you can help us, huh? Yeah, I'd love to. Then why don't you do me a favor, - and bring me a cardio-version device. - An uh? Exactly. Why don't you go down to the first floor and ask for Dr. Strohm? He knows exactly what I'll be needing. - OK. A cardio-version device. - Exactly. Tell him we need it for the cadaver here. Cardio-version device. First floor... And right away, otherwise it'll be too late! - Yes, cardio-version... - Gloves off! Wash your hands! Wash your hands! Let's get back to work as long as the idiot is out of the room. Not a projectile, more like a capsule. Post-mortem CT in forensic medicine has the advantage that even before you make the first incision with a scalpel you already know what to expect. This includes not only cadavers, in which... Dr. Strohm! Dr. Strohm! Pardon my interruption, but Prof. Herzfeld sent me. He'll be needing a cardio-version device. - Herzfeld? A cardio-version device? - Yes! He has a cadaver on his table. - It's urgent. - I don't know, who you are and what you're up to right now, but I can assure you: anybody on Prof. Herzfeld's table won't be requiring a defibrillator anymore. - Do you need any help? - No, thank you. Keep working on the abdominal organs, okay? I'll be right there. I'll be right back. There's no way in Christ's... Shit! Dad, please help me! Please! I'm gonna die, dad! He's gonna kill me, if you don't do what he says! He's controlling you every step of the way. He said, just the way you got this message better make you think. You know all the cops, dad, I know, but you are not allowed to talk to anyone! Do you understand? Wait for Erik! He'll tell you what to do next! You can't tell anyone, otherwise he'll kill me! Fuck! Professor Herzfeld? Are you in here? - Yes. - Everything okay? Yeah... No. I'm coming down with something, I don't know. Ah-ha. Can I help at all? Should I call a doctor? No, no get back to work. I'll be right there, I need a moment. Okay. Err... Did you open up the capsule? Yeah. Nothing. The capsule was empty. Okay. Hm... Okay. Please, not again. Can't we at least... Please, I have condoms in my bag, front pocket. No, no! Please! No! But of course, safe sex you little whore. Shit! You know all the cops, but you are not allowed to talk to anyone! Do you understand? Wait for Erik! He'll tell you what to do next! [INSTRUCTIONS!!!] You can't tell anyone, or he'll kill me! Hi, Penny! Tell me... Have you been in touch with Hannah at all? Hey, now's not a good time. It's almost seven here in Sydney and we're about to go to the opera... - It's really kind of... - Yeah, I heard about skiing and all, if that's what it's about. [PROFESSIONAL? RANSOM?] What am I supposed to do? You reap what you sow. Sorry... that wasn't fair. Let up on her, she's a teenager... Have a good time at the opera and say hi to Norman, yeah? See you. REVENGE Hello, Erik? Erik, say something. Just tell me what you are looking for and I will take care of it. No police. The Feds haven't been informed and won't be at any point. I just want my daughter back. Erik, tell me what you want and you'll get it, I'll make sure of that. Listen, you fucking dickhead, if you so much as touch my daughter, I don't care what it was, I'll massacre your fuckin ass! I will find you! I have resources at my disposal and I'll kill you, you son of... Hello? Shit! You fucking idiot! Erik? Listen up, I'm really sorry. Just tell me what you want, and you'll get it. Erik is dead. He's lying here, dead, on a beach in Heligoland. Who am I talking to? Linda. I was just walking by on the beach. Shut the fuck up! Cause I can see you're lovin' it. You're having fun, right?! You're lovin' it! What I'm sayin'! I don't like that! Women have to be chaste! And if they're not born like that, then we have to give 'em a hand. I'm not quite sure, how best to cut... Did you know that 97% of all women in Somalia are circumcised? 97%. Almost all of them. My question is, do I cut off your clitoris? Or your pussy lips? Whatta you think? 97%... So I'm gonna step outside now. Use your time wisely. Cause when I come back, you know what's gonna happen then. Do you really work for the police? More or less, I'm a forensic medical expert. Am I screwed now, cause I answered the telephone? No, don't worry. Where are the local police? They have no idea. I didn't have a phone with me and we're in a storm and nothings working. - I was gonna walk in to town and let them know. - No, no! Don't do that, there's no need for that. I beg you, seriously, Linda. Do not go to the police. What? And how come? My daughter's life depends on it. I can imagine how absolutely preposterous... It's way out there, but I... The only option I have is to beg you... Okay. That's not that out there. - The police don't help you anyway. - Now listen up. You have to promise me something. - I want you to wait for me. I am on my way. - Forget about it. There's a hurricane approaching. Not even the Coast Guard is on the water. Any connections to the island have been severed. I'll get there somehow. What are you, a fuckin' superhero? Or what's your plan? Do you need a ride, Professor Herzfeld? How come you're still here? Your colleagues implied I'd better quit my internship. And I get it, I screwed that up. But I could make it up to you by driving you home. No, don't worry about it! I got a taxi coming! Linda, have you gone through his stuff yet? No! The message from Hannah didn't say, "Erik will get in touch" or "Erik will give information." It said "wait for Erik, he'll have further directions for you." Do you understand? The first direction was on my autopsy table this morning in the corpse - and now there's another dead person... - Aw, just come on. Who knows when a taxi will come with weather like this? - ...you know, so it's a kind of... - Scavenger hunt. - With corpses. - Exactly. And somewhere attached to Erik. The next clue has gotta be there with the next direction, that will lead me to Hannah, do you understand? Do you think you're up to inspecting the body? Uh... Okay. I'm on it. Oh, come on. How difficult are you gonna make it for me to apologize? - All I want is to say I'm sorry. - Professor? This is the last time I'm doing this crap. This was by far the most icky, repulsive thing I've ever done my whole life. And what a load of shit. He's got nothing. No key, no briefcase, not even a pack of gum. Just this stupid cell phone. Linda, call the clinic on the island and get in touch with a certain Ender Müller, about the corpse you found. Don't talk to anyone but him, otherwise it's on record. - Who the hell is Ender Müller? - Custodian in the building. How come that doesn't surprise me. More likely an indication that the person behind this knows me well. I'll give Ender a call and let him know you're coming. Don't talk with anyone until I get there. Till you get here? Haven't you been listening? Hurricane Anna is playing Housepiñata and winning! The roof of the frickin' clinic blew off a few hours ago! I don't think I'll be reaching anyone! - How long is this supposed to go on? - Probably three days at least! The waves are who knows how high! Not even Moses would make it here. - We are totally cut off! - Alright. I'll be there. So? Where would you like me to bring you? Heligoland. Up front! Move it up! Bad goal! Bad goal! How come men never get cellulitis? Cause it looks like shit? - Have I told that one already? - No, not today, Ender. Yo? Hey, Professor! So what gives me the pleasure, huh? - Hey! - Oh Jesus Christ. Yeah, no, no. Sorry about that. The cops are all on the mainland. - Yeah, the doctors too. - Yo, Christmas is coming! Ender Müller? Well, she's proactive! God knows what my parents were thinkin'. Anyway, Ender, that's my name. I said "Ma, I wanna be at the beginning," and she said "End o' this discussion." - Good, huh? - Hey! It's 9 to 3! Let's call it a tie. Know why men never get cellulitis? Ugh. Cause it looks like shit. What the fuck? How come everyone knows that one already? Right. Brr! Where did you meet Herzfeld? Every year people jump from the cliffs, and if there's ever cause for suspicion, Paul comes around and does an autopsy. Good guy! Uhh! Yo, Paul's probably right. We don't want to make a big deal outta this. Not that people start freakin' out and all considering you can't get off the island at the moment. Alright then. Berlin Central, please. Ugh! I hope this crappy weather is really over in three days, huh? I got something important on the mainland. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I got a recall for GGT. Germany's Got Talent. The TV show. I'm not into "janitor" written on my gravestone. I've got a calling! - And what are your talents? - I do stand-up. But got my own concept. Body Comedy. Like, "Bomedy." - So like acrobatics? - No, not stupid stuff. I'm naked in front of the jury, show off a bit with my hunkbucket, tell a couple jokes. But don't worry, cause I do not unpack my biggest muscle. Hm, what a pity. Wanna hear a good one? Neighbors upstairs just moved outta their basement apartment. Pow! Get it? Cause there ain't nothin' under a basement apartment. Yo, Sana-clinik, Ender Müller. Who is speeding? Hey, Paul! No, it's forwarded to the land line. No cell connection here in the basement. What? Yeah, no. Yeah, we're doing A-OK! Don't worry about it. The world's coming to an end out there and no one's out and about. I could have brought the corpse on a white elephant and no one would've snatched it. What? No way, Paul! No! No fuckin way! Yeah, no, I don't care how friggin important it is, Paul! You said bring the corpse down to the pathology department and then we're cool. Corpse here, we're cool! Huh? Paul, Paul, I'm shittn' myself just standing here in pathology, get it? I would love to help you, but I can't. Not gonna happen. Got it? Huh? I'll start barfin' is why! What am I supposed to do? I won't be able to help you. What? - Linda, what's your job? - I sketch. She's a painter. Walls or portraits? - Comics! - Cartoons. So that means you're dextrous with your fingers. That right? Linda, listen up, you were right. It's gonna take a while for me to get to the island and I have to ask you a big favor for me. What? You... I'm gonna need you to conduct an autopsy for me. - Are you trying to make a joke? - No. A little while ago it was a joke, maybe, but now I mean it. Seriously. Lay the corpse down with the feet pointing towards the sink. The small table next to the portable tray with the sink. Right next to the shower head. See it? - No fucking way! - Make sure you put on gloves. Thick, ideally ones that are nubbed. And try and find a rubber apron. Ender knows where all these are. Tell him you need two stable knives, but not a scalpel. The blades break too easily and you can get hurt if you're not used to them. You're also gonna need large tweezers - and scissors to cut open his clothes. - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold on a sec, Professor! Have you lost your mind? Yes, it's possible I've lost my mind. The first corpse this morning... And then what I found, the message, my daughter calling for help. It was in the calvarium, the head of a corpse, do you understand? The message was not at the corpse, it was inside of it. So you're asking that I cut the man open and root about for hidden messages inside of him? Linda, I know I am asking a lot but I'm running out of time! Hannah is... So, like your daughter? Hannah is in a bad situation but wouldn't it be better to get professional help? This is not only about Hannah. I don't know who's behind this but they've already committed at least two murders. Which means we're dealing with a serial murderer. And what if the murderer is still on the island and planning to kill more people? Linda, I like you and I'm aware of the fact that I have no right to demand this of you. I can only plead with you. - Linda, please. - I'm a vegetarian. I can't even slice a steak in two halves and now you're asking me to... - I promise you, you won't have to eat that man on the table. - Ha, ha. I'll walk you through it step by step. You... Hello? Shit! Fuck! - Hey, intern! - Ingolf! - Yeah, whatever. - Hey, you're still here! Yeah, the trains aren't running... - Hey dickhead, get your BMW out of the way! - BMW? You've no idea! This is a top of the class Mercedes with 610 horse power! Then turn'em the fuck on! Your horsepower. - You're blocking the exit! - Yeah, yeah... So, err, I'm not curious, but all that stuff I just heard... You're not some sick person now, are you? - No, no. - Hey, asshole... So this thing. This story from Heligoland... - is pretty significant? - Life and death significant! Got it? Life and death. - Hey! - Everything's cool! - Err, we're leaving in a second. - A second? What are you, a smartass? - I'll smack you upside your head in a second! - Just calm down. Um, I'd like to suggest we get some supplies and warm blankets, because in this weather getting stuck in traffic can be unpleasant. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. Can we start now with the external examination? He keeps saying "we." But I'm pretty much alone here and I am only gonna examine him from the outside. What I have here is something totally normal, right? No reason to freak out. Exactly right. 150,000 people die every day. That is two per second, to the tune of around 56 million per year. Seems like there are more people dead than alive, if you think about it. Yes, correct. We assume nowadays that over 100 billion Homo Sapiens have already expired. And nevertheless I've got my first corpse in front of me. How come we spend so little time thinking about death. Why is that? I can't answer that. But if you're gonna go through with this Linda, you gotta start now, yeah? Oh, it's disgusting! I don't remember him stinking like that! Linda, please describe exactly, what you are seeing. - At the moment I can only smell. - Yeah, I know. Only corpses stink like corpses. I don't know if it makes you feel better, but you never get used to it. - Don't feel better. - What do you see? Ugh. He looks kinda unreal. Like made of wax. He's big. Six two. Maybe 220 pounds. Toenails haven't been cut. He's just wearing a t-shirt and jeans. The word "Erik" is written on his shirt, probably with a magic marker. His head's uh... His eyes are closed, God help me. Mouth is open slightly. Teeth are yellow, like he smoked. Okay, Put him on the autopsy table. No, sorry about that, Paul, I told you... I don't give a shit, Ender! You're gonna do this now! Since when did you become such a wimp, huh? I'm sorry. Listen, you're gonna have to pull him on his right arm to the left, from the stretcher onto the autopsy table. Out of the body bag. And you're gonna have to be careful with his skin, in case he was exposed to moisture. This is fuckin' gross, man! Wha! Ugh! Now what? Now remove the shirt and pants. What? No! No fuckin' way. - I'm drawing a line here. - Linda, we already talked about this. The corpse has to be stripped. You and me talked about it, Professor? You must be crazy! What I expressed was, I'll examine it from the outside. How will you examine the body, if it is still dressed, huh? If the man was injured, then how are you going to know what happened? Fuck! Fuuuck! Uh, here's something. Hangin' around his neck. - A chain, with a key on it. - What kind of a key? Like a normal one. No writing, no number, nothing. Is that the clue? The key? Perhaps. Hard to believe though, that'd be too easy. Uh-uh. Any marks or distinguishing blemishes you can see? No, no piercings or shit like that. He has a scar under his left nipple. Like from being vaccinated. What does the pubic area look like? Err, pubic area is fab, it's all A-OK. I'm thinking we can wrap this up. Linda? Linda?! Ugh! Dude shit in his pants before he kicked the bucket. Yeah, that's normal, unfortunately. Get some scissors, it'll make it easier. So... The corpse is now laying here naked. It's all... ...normal. There's nothing conspicuous? Now that you mention it, his penis looks like a swastika. No, all normal, what I've been telling you! Otherwise I would've said something, right? Linda, I'm aware you're stressed out. You have no motherfucking idea! His legs, did you spread them out? Yeah, a little. How come that's important? Cause you're... gonna have to inspect his rectum. No. No. No! Linda, calm down. At this moment I just need a superficial look. Spread his legs as wide as possible and try and take a look. Linda? - Nah. - No what? No objects up his fuckin' asshole, okay? Good, that should be enough for now. Thank you. You're welcome! Now take the tweezers - and use them to twist up the eyelids. - Oh man... Do I have to? I Feel like I'm fuckin' Frankenstein. Punctuated hemorrhaging in the conjunctiva could be a sign of violent strangulation. There is no other way to check for this. So please, take a close look! No pain here. Corpses feel no pain. Yeah, there are like dark red spots on the inside of the eyelids, like speckles on a pigeon egg. Any visible injuries on his throat? Yeah, maybe, like an abrasion. Like something was pressed up against his neck. Five or six centimeters long, and one in width. Like he was strangled maybe. So what does that mean? Let's move up to bis head. Then what? Listen Professor, I somehow have the feeling you wanna move from the external to internal autopsy supposing I'm not even going to notice. I'm not gonna be cutting this dude up, can you comprehend that at least? You may not have to do any of this. Let's go step by step. Now, please open up the mouth. Does it help that the guy's got dentures? Take 'em out. Ugh! Ugh! This is fuckin' weird. - What do you see? - OK. OK, I'm outta here! - Is the joint that connects the jaw missing? - No. It's like someone's cut out his tongue. Is the missing tongue the clue you've been looking for? Can you identify blood in the mouth cavity? A little bit. That means the tongue wasn't dissevered until after the body was dead. Makes no sense at all. Yeah, as if anything we're doing made sense! Maybe not for you, but for the culprit. And, what he assumes, for me as well. Look down his throat. Way down! I don't see anything. But I also don't have X-ray vision. - A flash-light, maybe? - Yeah, wait a minute. - Ugh! Yeah, there's something in there. - What? No idea. Looks a bit plastic-yellowish. Try and pull it out. Doesn't work. The tweezers are sliding off. It's too slippery. I keep pushing it in more and more. You're absolutely right. Leave it alone for now. Really good idea. Okay, good. When are you gonna be here? I wasn't implying... That's not what I meant. Linda, you err... Your gonna have to cut his throat open. Linda? Hello? Linda?! Jesus, Fuck! You dumbass. Fuck! Fuck... You're mine! Ender? Now I got you! - Yeah? - Please, listen closely. The yellow object. That's why we're doing all of this. That's where the clue is. Then your job is finished. - Only one cut. - It's a human being! You can't expect that of me and you know it! Or are you so deformed by your morbid job? You want me to cut open a human being? What I want to do as of this morning is just a vague recollection. What I want to do is no longer a factor in my life! The only thing that counts is what I'm compelled to do, cause God dammit, I have no other fucking option! I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry. Do you have children? No, I'm 24. Uh-hm. - Do you want kids, someday? - Yeah. But not yet. I draw comics. I'm still a kid myself. My daughter's 17. She's... She's fond of comics, as far as I can tell. That's really manipulative. Emotionally. That's a pretty shitty move. You're a pretty big asshole, if you put it all together. You know Linda, if I have to accept the fact that you're calling me an asshole, then we can be friends, right? Linda? Linda, what's going on? Err... Everything's fine. It's cool, it's cool. - I thought I just saw Danny. - Danny? - My ex. - Your ex is on Heligoland? There's no way he can be here, but... Err, and he's a problem? Not a, he's the problem. He hurt me. Badly. And then he acquired a taste for it. So he's following you? A stalker. What a pleasant, practical word. Stalker. But it doesn't capture that sense of being so defenseless. To violence. To your body and in your head. Or that he is wherever I am regardless of time. - Even if he's not there. - I'm really sorry to hear that. Me too. By the way, I'll do it. - I'm sorry? - I'll cut the guy up. In the past few hours I wasn't thinking about Danny at all for the first time in who knows. And I wasn't afraid. Nausea, yeah, but I wasn't afraid. Linda, that's... that's... Thank you. Thank you. You can thank me later, Paul. Thanks. Professor Herzfeld, considering that I'm driving you around... during the end of the world here... Might I get another chance to participate in an autopsy? You're totally unfit for that. Hello? Linda? Is this actually legal what we're about to do? Can any old amateur go and cut up some old lady? No, that's desecration of a corpse. Desecration? Wow! Yeah. But I'm allowed to do this. And you are in end effect an extension of me. I take full responsibility! Now listen closely. You place the knife on the underside of the chin. You press deeply into the flesh and you make a cut straight down to the sternum. - I can see the muscles. - Good. This is very good. Now I want you to place the knife once again at the point of the chin. Go to the right and left parallel to both lower jaws. I'm on it. - And now it's done. - Very good. You're gonna need both hands for the next step, one for the knife, the other for the tweezers. Draw the skin away and undermine the fat tissue with the blade. What does that mean? Yeah, Undermine means you pull the skin up and detach the fat tissue underneath with horizontal incisions. It's similar to... like cutting a filet mignon. Just don't compare this to food, please. You're right. Sorry. Seems to have a piece of meat in his throat. That's the base of the tongue. - The stump you can probably just, err.. - Amputate? Amputate. Exactly. - Done! - Good. Now with the tip of the knife, you can cut open the larynx and then pull out the gristle in there. Like with a shrimp. - Paul! Can you avoid food? - Eh, yeah. Ahh... Man! Ender! What the fuck?! Linda? Sorry, I didn't know it was gonna be this loud. I thought music might relax everything a little bit. Put a lid on it! How am I supposed to talk on the telephone? Linda! - What's going on? - Wait a minute. I dropped the friggin thing. - Wha? Do you have the object? - Hold on! I'm looking! Do you have the object? - Do you have the object, Linda? - Yes. And what is it? One of those surprise eggs. So like not the chocolate, just the yellow plastic thing. - Should I open it? - Yes, but carefully! - Oha! - It's a picture of some old lady. Kiss my motherfu... Paul! - That's Töven. Friederike Töven. - You know this woman? Well from around, yeah. She lives on the island. Paul? Were you listening? - Babette? - Hello. Quick question. I've got listed in my private calendar a meeting with a Mrs. Friederike Töven I've no idea who that is and can't remember what it's about. Would you check the databank and find out who that is? Töven. Got it. I'll get right back to you. Thank you. What are we going to do in Cuxhaven, if we find out that no ferries are running? Do me a favor and... How rich are you exactly? What makes you think that I'd be rich? Quite... quite rich. Stayclose. de - What? - The same thing as Facebook. Set it up when I was 14 years old. I called it an online friendship book. At some point I had 400,000 profiles. Yeah. You know how the times were... One day I got an email from another social media site... And probably sold the site for a million Euros. Yeah, I was fourteen. Told them I wanted 14 million for the site, as like a joke. Yeah, but they said yes. - 14 million? - Hm. And they were all real nice. Cultivated. - Hello? - Friederike Töven is Friederike Erlang. At least that was her name when she was judge in the trial against Jan Sadler. After the whole controversy she retired early, resumed her maiden name, and now resides in... In Heligoland. CAUSE OF DEATH: HANGING No, no, no. I'm sorry. You're not allowed to be here! Let me see my daughter. Jens, you shouldn't be here. Paul, let me see my daughter, fuck the rules! It's not about that. Don't do this to yourself, yeah? Come on, come. Jens, she hung herself. There's no reason to doubt that. Yeah, but that fucker made Lily do it. He licked my daughter on her entire body! And then he raped her. Again and again and again. And then he described how he planned to torture her! For so long till she ultimately had no alternative. And then he left a noose there for her. Can you follow this, Paul? It was him who murdered her! Christ! He might as well've put the noose around her neck. Jens, I'm aware of all that. And I'm certain, the court will bear that in mind. This fucking pig will spend a lot of time behind... A lot? C'mon, you shitting me? Huh, Paul? We both do the same job and we both know, if he's only convicted of rape that at the latest, after five years he's out of jail, at the very latest. Jens, it wasn't only just rape. It was abduction as well, and Lily was a minor. How old is Hannah now, huh? Huh? - 13, am I right? - Yeah. So tell me, you want Sadler roaming around when Hannah is finishing high school? No Jens, obviously not! - But I cannot break the rules... - Yes, yes you can! It's in your hand. You just write it down. Write that he murdered her. That's not a lie. We can cremate the body and nobody'll be able to verify it, Paul! Please! Just do this, please. Jens, that's a criminal offense. If word were to get out... - No word'll get out, Paul. - It's too much of a risk. Ah! What do you mean risk? A risk for you? For your career? Jens, if word got out, that'd be a feast for Sadler's lawyers - and he'd be out much earlier! - Enough! Listen, I've got money. Just inherited. 160,000 Euros. I've spoken about this to Claudia already. Yeah? It means nothing to us. The money's yours! Paul? Jens, don't do this please. I'm sorry. There are mitigating circumstances on behalf of the accused, that he never showed any sign of inappropriate behavior. And therefore we must not lose sight of the potential for social rehabilitation pertaining to first-time offenders. The court therefore issues a punishment for the case of rape before us, a prison sentence of three years and eight months. The grounds for judgement are the following. Three and a half years?! Hey, we're gonna appeal. Three and a half years?! This bastard raped my only daughter! He raped her and then forced her to commit... It was murder, you godforsaken witch! You saw the videos with your own eyes! This man is a monster. He's a monster! Why is he allowed to go on living, this scum? While my Lily has maggots crawling out of her eyes?! Paul? Paul! Zarrentin? Never heard of it. It's a little village on Lake Schalsee. Easy to reach via local roads. - What are we doing there? - Recalculating. It's where Marinek lives. Is that the guy who abducted your daughter? Sorry about that, it's not like I get off on spying on your private phone conversations, but I can't cover my ears and drive you halfway across Europe. And about yourself... Well, you don't say anything. How come you're doing this anyway, huh? - What? - Why are you helping me? I already told you, for the internship. I wanted a second chance to be able to... Blablabla. I don't believe a word of it. You're as rich as hell, you could buy any internship you wanted. Yes. - I wanted to have the on with you. - Why? I'm sorry, but considering the circumstances, it's not really appropriate. And I would say, at this moment it is very appropriate. I'll let you know at some point, but not until we get this whole thing taken care of and it ends well. But now? It's all about you, I'd say. Who, err, is this Marinek guy? I don't know, if he abducted my daughter, but he definitely has something to do with this. - And how do we know this? - Cause of the judge. What judge? Mrs. Töven! Hello? Are you in there? An old woman is not gonna be hanging around outside in this weather! Mrs. Töven, sorry to bother you! We found your picture stuffed in the throat of a corpse! - She ain't home. C'mon! - Come on, Ender! You can't go around opening people's doors! Mrs. Töven? - Hello? - Mrs. Töven? Mrs. Töven? LENIENT JUDGE: JAN S. RELEASED - Linda? - Hey, Professor! Where you aware that Ender moonlights as a locksmith? We found Friederike Töven's house. Looks like it's empty, though. Don't go in. - Whatever you do, don't go in the house! - Tss! I already desecrated a corpse for you. Breaking and entering won't make a difference! That's not what I mean. You have no idea what to expect in there. Ender! We'll take a look around, and then we'll go. What's the problem? Problem? Linda, I don't think you're getting this! Whoever hid that picture of Töven in Erik's throat is connected to Hannah's kidnapping and is a two-time, extremely brutal serial killer and this person just might be hiding in the house this moment, in a closet, under the couch, behind a door or who knows where else. So please, leave the house with Ender right away! Jesus, Mary and Joseph! - Ender! - Linda, are you listening? - What's going on? - She needs help! They taught us this in driving school. Fuck! Linda, where are you? Linda, talk to me! What's going on? Oh God in heaven! - She's dead. - No, she's still alive! She's breathing! - Linda! - Help me out here! How many times do you have push? Is it twelve? Or eighteen? How many times?! Linda, she's dead! This woman is dead! Just take... Take a look at her! She's been dead. Fuck! Linda! Linda! Jesus Christ, Linda! What the hell is going on? - She... she was still like breathing. - Linda? - Respiration sounds. - She moaned! The body decomposes and expels air out of the lungs. Paul, she's got spots. Lividity? They go away when you press on them? Do they go away when you press? Err... Let me see. - No. - Then she's been dead for several hours. Paul, it's me. There's no one here. I checked the house. You're gonna have to bring the body down to the morgue, ok? Yeah, of course we can do that, but we ain't jumpin' for joy, that's for sure. I'll get back to you! - Your colleague lives here? - Yeah, after his daught... After his daughter Lily... Since back then. Oh, look! There must be about 100,000 Euros. It's a 160,000. That's exactly the amount that Jens Marinek offered me. I think someone's expecting you. Whoa! And you stay put! Jens? Jens? Jens, it's me. Jens? God, it's really warm in here! Dude, better be careful with that thing there. You, remain where you are, at the door. Have you understood? - There must be more of those things! - son-of-a-bitch!! I said, wait at the door, goddammit! I was waiting by the door, but then I found this here. Look! It's an autopsy report. Err, from... There was a young woman, she'd been raped, died of a broken neck, but uhh... both name and age are missing. And there's a picture... Maybe that could be your daughter? Professor Herzfeld, maybe that isn't a good... Ugh... So, time to finally put an end to this serial murders. We only got two tables! Nah... Let's hope our killer knows that, too! Not that he thinks we got an unlimited supply of tables. Unlimited ta... Hey. Hey. You afraid? Yeah of course, you not? Yeah, but it's cool. It s been worse. Look out. What the fuck is that? Probably the back-up power supply. Generator must by conking out. Where are you going? Just gonna check if everything's okay. Be right back. Huh. Great! Fuck! Someone there? Ender? You're not seriously considering doing an autopsy on this animal, are you? If that was expected of me, then there'd be autopsy tools laying around. Up until now it was all consistent. One part of the puzzle led to another one. First the body, then the ax, the money. There's a certain latent symbolism here. The symbolism isn't that hard to decipher. You 're a pig. What was the first thing we came across here? Err, the money? No, it wasn't that. Not the money. They're my size. What do they symbolize? Err... Puddles? Rain? Being wet? Water. Woah. Oh, that's that Jan Sadler, who was on the news way back when. He must have been trailing him 24 hours a day. For three and a half years Jens had to be patient, till he could go through with this. Hey, and why are you the one he wants to get revenge on? He should spend his time going after this "specimen." I'm afraid he already did that. - Oh, is that a... - Tongue. Exactly. And now we know who Erik is. No one's answering. Have you seen this yet? Yeah, that's Lily Marinek. No, I'm talking about this here. Oh God! Is that your daughter? I'm not sure. Look at her ankle. Some kind of tattoo. She have one like that? Err... I... I don't know. What is he planning on doing with the body? Who's filming that? Must be two of them. He's bringing her here. Hey, what's that there, out there? It looks like a buoy, or what is it? No idea. - Let me go take a look! - Wait! No! Whoa! - Looks like some kind of a cross! - What?! Any doubts yet? That was never my cup of tea. No! Stop! - It really is a cross! - Ingolf! You're way too close! Ingolf? Ingolf! Ingolf! Turn around, towards me. Ingolf, listen to me. You have to stay calm. It's only a matter of seconds, till your muscles get stiff and cease to function. I can't go to you cause the ice will break. I want you to do the following. You're gonna look at me and do one stroke in my direction. Then I can grab you. Have you understood? Give me your hand. Ender?! Ender, tell me it's you! Ah, it's you, oh my God. There was someone... Ender? It's all good, everything's fine. We gotta warm you up. Everything's fine. We gotta get you back inside the house. Gotta get you warm. Okay? Back to the heating units. We have to get you warm or ther'll be hypothermia. And you'll be dead. Ah! Not... on my... first date. Good! That's good! Stay awake. Talk to me! Okay? Tell me something. Hey, hey! Stay awake! Look at me, don't go to sleep! - Hello? - Paul, I got a serious problem here! The lights went out, Ender was suddenly gone. They went back on, Ender was in front of me with a knife in his shoulder. - Ender, can he still walk? - He took two steps into the room and then he passed out and fell into my arms. - You're gonna have to go for help. - What am I going to do? There're no doctors on the island and the killer's here in the building! Can you lock yourself away somewhere? Yeah, I already did that. Fuck! I have no idea, if Ender is gonna be able to hold on! - His pulse? - Really weak! Blood? Yeah, but it's no longer spouting! Good! Maybe we're lucky, none of the important arteries were affected. - Should I pull the knife out? - No! No way! Don't pull out the knife. You can't move him at all. You have to keep him warm. And what? Jesus Christ, Paul! I need like some support here! Give me five minutes. Paul?! Paul... You son of a bitch. Paul! You fuckin' asshole! What am I supposed to do, you idiot? Fuck! KEEP CALM IN AN EMERGENCY No, Ender, it's not time to go yet, okay? Ender? Ender? Don't die now, please! Was that Hannah in the video? Is she in the lake? If she is in the lake, then it doesn't matter what I do. If she's alive, it does. So I'm working under the assumption she's still alive. You saved my life. I... I forgive you. Like this morning, you remember? With the... with the def... Defibr... Defibrili... Defibre... That was a mean joke. I forgive you. Hello? Who's that? Hello? - Ender. - Hey now, what's going on? - What's going on? - How come you don't feel anything? - Must have caught a cold... - No! No, no, no. Hold on! You're not allowed to touch that! Listen up! It's like we've been mugged. You were injured by the killer. Don't touch it! Not on your head. And more so, not on your shoulder, okay? Shi... sh... Ender... Ender! Ender! Whoa! Finally! Linda, what's goin' on out there, huh? If you wanna know, I'm barricading the door! - Linda, you have a key, don't you? - Yes, I do Professor, but the killer has one, too! Linda, you gotta get out of there so Ender can be treated. Forget about it. I called the local weather service. - And? - No chance of any planes. In five hours there might be a window perhaps, when flights might be possible. - Five hours are way too long. - Fuck! Do something! You're with the police! Wish it were that simple. Lemme see what I can do. Yes please! Cause I'm totally not into... to watching Ender die before my eyes or that this psycho comes back and impales me like the old woman there. - What did you just say? - I'm not into watch... No, no, no, what's the impale thing! - What do you mean? - That someone jammed a stick up her ass, for chrissake!! That's what I mean. Take it out. No, I'm gonna lay down in the fetal position on the floor next to Ender and wait for the cavalry and pray I'll still remember the Our Father. Linda, I promise you in the name of all I love: I will find a way to get to you in the next two hours! But before that, no one will get over there, understand? No special ops, no SWAT team, not the CIA and certainly not the cavalry! - Linda, this stick is a broomstick, right? - Yeah. How do you know that? From a video, I'll explain it later. Listen: The kidnapper carved something in the stick. That is the clue! Good, Professor. I'll help you. You got two hours. Then I'm gonna call the police, the fire department and the news. You got something to write with? - Do we? - Yeah! 5-3-6-6-4... 3-5-7-3-6-4-9-0. On the other side, the half that you know... is another one. 9-0-8-9-2-0-7-0- 5-3-1-8-4-5-1. - Are there dots? - What's that? Linda! - Are there periods? - Decimal points, dots. Yeah, maybe. After the numbers. - Hold on. - What do you think it means? There really are periods here. In the first number after the 2nd digit, and in the second one after the 1st digit. Linda, I'll call you right back. - They're geo-coordinates. - What's that? Geo-coordinates. Here's the user's manual from Mercedes. No idea how it works. The sales guy made a big deal that you can put geo-coordinates into the GPS. - Okay. - It's a feature for their luxury... - Hello? - The lab tests are back from the dead woman. A cyanide derivative. So that means she was poisoned? - Yeah, but it was suicide. - That's ridiculous. Someone cut out her jaw joint and then amputated both hands. But it was after she died and she consented. After my passing my dead body will at least have a purpose. There's a farewell letter of sorts. A video our colleagues found in Schwintowski's apartment. I do all this in full command of my cognitive abilities and own free will. - Who was this woman? - Sybille Schwintowski. Wife of Philipp Schwintowski, who owns a moving company. They have one daughter, Rebecca. Schwintowski... Who is that? The Feds have a huge file on him. Bookmaking, loan sharking, mafia connections. When he was younger he was in court for murder but got acquitted for lack of evidence. Please, no! Don't do it! He's calmed down a bit, now that he's older. Apparently due to his wife and daughter. He's supposed to be a loving dad. What does he say to all this? Has he been questioned? No, he's still being looked for. His daughter, too. Gone without a trace. Does this Schwintowski guy have a sailboat by any chance? Yeah! He's a real sailing aficionado, does all sorts of races. How did you know that? Professor? Hello? You have reached your destination. Where are we? No idea. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Ingolf, I'd like you to remain here for the moment. Be right back. I wanna take a look around. Are you sure you want to go out there by yourself? Give me ten minutes, and if I haven't returned by then, call the police, okay? Ingolf? I told you you're supposed to stay in the car! Shit! Why are your feet so big? Is this what your looking for?! Does it turn you on?! Hannah... - Huh... - Jens, where is Hannah? Tell me, is she alive? Jens, please. Tell me that Hannah is still alive, please. Ah! How did you manage to keep everyone outside? I thought you were out of the loop. That you weren't part of any investigations. - You're such a stickler for rules. - Was that your plan? Doing all this fucked up shit to teach me a lesson? You lucked out with the hurricane. Otherwise you wouldn't have made it. Your doorkeeper buddy would've called the police a long time ago. Why all... Jens, I don't understand why you're doing this. Hannah was in no way responsible for your daughter, and I wasn't either. No, you didn't murder my Lily. Not her. Why are you emphasizing it like that? This is not about you, Paul. Not about your daughter, either. - Not even about my daughter. - Then what the fuck is this?! - He'll explain it all. - Who? Schwintowski? The man is a known criminal, Jens! What? What are you doing? What did you just put in your mouth? Why... Jens... How nice that you're awake, Paul. No! Hold on! That's Enough! Ah! - Get the bag with the autopsy tools. - Did you do that?! Get the bag with the autopsy tools! Marinek swallowed a memory chip We have to get it out of his insides before the stomach acid totally dissolves it! Congratulations, Professor Herzfeld. If you made it this far, then you'll have almost completed your lesson. By the look of it, you weren't doing things by the book this time. You lied, kept your mouth shut, suppressed evidence. All the things Jens had asked of you back then. Funny. My name is Philipp Schwintowski and you killed my daughter. Did you see the pictures in the boat house? If Jens hadn't been trailing that bastard, I never would have found my daughter. That whore of a judge thought child molesters should be rehabilitated. Do you believe that as well, Professor? And even if you say yes, do animals like that deserve to be re-integrated? No, they deserve one thing only: the same agony they inflicted on their victims. That son-of-a-bitch hadn't even been out of prison six weeks, when he nabbed my daughter Rebecca. Mrs. Schwintowski, I'm here about your daughter. We hit all the places where Jens had been spying on Sadler and we found her. But it was too late. That fucker was still there, though. I wanted to torture him to death, then and there, and have my people take care of the judge. But then Jens explained to me that there are more important things than revenge. There's a problem in the system: perpetrators are made into victims and victims become perpetrators. Courts punish tax evaders more than child molesters! Psychologists that recommend parole for rapists, cause they had a tough childhood. It affects everyone in this great nation of ours. It's about you, Professor. There are thousands of rules, and regulations, and laws, But everything's all fucked up. We waited till Sadler's injury healed up enough. Jens sewed up the stump of his tongue so that bastard wouldn't bleed to death. First we gave him something to look forward to, then we let him do the dirty work. Sadler and the judge both deserved to die, and me and Jens... We fucking lost everything. Why go on living? But you should get a chance to save your daughter. Jens said, you're a good guy. But even good guys make mistakes and they gotta be accountable. We left Hannah alone with Sadler. If you want to find her follow the white light of Alcatraz. What the hell's that? Does he mean San Francisco? Alcatraz is an island. Heligoland. Schwintowski was bluffing. Jan Erik Sadler isn't able to harm your daughter, because he's dead in the mor... Yeah, but that's not it. "We left Hannah alone with Sadler," he said... Past tense. It's enough, if they leave Hannah for a while alone with Sadler, that's... He explains in gruesome detail what he's gonna do and then gives 'em a fucking noose. Schwintowski hanged himself. That's the last clue. If I don't get Hannah fast enough, she'll be hanging there just like that. Okay, I got it. Schwintowski'd never've killed himself without taking revenge on Sadler to kill them. No way. He didn't try and hide it, which is why we were able to find Erik. - What about the time code? - What you mean? What about it? The date's from the day before yesterday. There must be a mistake. Put in the wrong date or whatever Why is that? Because tonight on the island of Heligoland someone stabbed my friend Ender with a fucking knife in his goddamn throat and since Sadler is dead it has to be Schwintowski! Let's get moving! There's a calm in the storm. If it's like this over the water as well, then it might be possible for a rescue helicopter to fly. We can let the authorities know. Everyone involved is dead now. Hopefully we can make it before the weather ch... Fuck! Jens slashed the tires. Crap! What should we do? - You have spare tires? - Yes, but just one. That's not gonna work in this kind of terrain. We'll never get there in time. You still have the key? Never left my pant's pocket. Get in the car. Err, Professor Herzfeld, you're driving deeper into the forest. Exactly. Are you wearing your seatbelt? We're not gonna get far like this. We're not going far. No emergency vehicle will get here and save us. You're aware of that, right? Why don't you take this opportunity and tell me why you wanted to get to know me. This could be your last chance to do that. Why's that? You planning on killing us? Bit like that. Start talking! My 14 million's in the meantime a lot more than that. Get it? A whole lot more. And with all that money you've, you've... You've responsibility and shit! I started an endowment that's there to support forensic medicine around the whole world. Mass graves, shit like that. And I wanted a director. All I wanted was a director! I'll think about it. Ahhhh! Don't worry, okay? The two hours aren't over yet. And he made us a promise. Another fifteen minutes then... then I'll go by myself, okay? Who is that?! What do you want from me?! Ugh! What do you want from me?! What the fuck do you want from me?! Danny?! You're freakin' me out, Danny! Stop! Please stop! I'm mot Dammy. Err, okay. What was that about? You smashed my car on purpose. It was your idea. - How? - Geo-coordinates. As I was skimming through the owner's manual I saw something worth noting. There's an in-car emergency call system - that sends the coordinates, when the airbags go off. - Are you being serious? And then assuming it all works, you shouldn't have to wait more than 10 minutes in all of Germany until emergency services are sent to the accident. Premium class! In other words, our fate is in the hands of a car salesman? Manufacturer. Manufacturer. We're gonna freeze to death. Emergency vehicles won't make it here! Exactly. Seven minutes. W'ere iff it? What? - Uh ghee? - Speak clearly, you freak! Ah! Uh ghee! Uh ghee!! Why 'in't ou 'ell me?!! Ah! Ugh! You mae a bid midake. You know what? Fuck you, Danny! I'm mot Dammy!! Ahh!! Ah! Ugh! Hmph! Ah... Ugh!! Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Please hurry, Professor. You made a promise to us. C'mon, let's go! How you doin'! I'm Paul Herzfeld. I'm running an operation for the Federal Police. My colleague Mr. von Appen. Udo Bandrupp. My father's the mayor here. How can I help? "Follow the light from Alcatraz!" Does that sentence mean anything to you? Ender? Ender? Shit! Ender? Breathe! No! No! - No, no... - Linda! No, you can go fuck yourself! - You're not gonna hurt me anymore. - Linda. - You're not gonna hurt me anymore! - Linda! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! - Go away! - Linda, it's me, Paul. Paul Herzfeld. - Just calm down now. The Professor, yes. - The Professor. You made it! - Everything's fine. Just relax. - Ender... I was forced to pull the knife from his shoulder - when he started to attack us. - What? - Who? - Danny. Danny. Who is it that attacked you, Linda? I don't know. He wanted to have the key. It wasn't Danny. It wasn't Danny... He can go fuck himself. Ugh! Oh my fucking God! This is not Jan Sadler, it's Schwintowski! How can that be? When Schwintowski was committing murder on Jan Sadler, he must have made a mistake. He thought he was dead, and abandoned the body somewhere where he knew it would be found. But Sadler wasn't dead. He came back, removed his tongue and prepped the body exactly as Schwintowski did with him, including the "Erik" T-shirt and the surprise egg in the throat. It effects everyone in this great nation of ours. It's about you, Professor! Maybe he thought it a good idea to keep a low profile. I've no idea. Where is the the key. The key that Linda was talking about the whole time? Mr. Mayor, what can you tell me about Alcatraz? We don't really have a prison here or nothing. Might be a little far-fetched, but Alcatraz has a famous lighthouse. Beacons every five seconds, just like ours. Does the lighthouse have a basement? There's a system of bunkers under the tower stretching 20km. The Nazis built them during World War II. We closed down the entrance a while back after two kids got lost in there. We didn't find 'em for days. They were long dead. Been a while since I used the keys. Is there another entrance? Not one, hundreds! It's a friggin labyrinth. Some shafts end at the coast. We're gonna need a hundred guys for this! Open the gate. - Hannah! - Hannah! My question is, do I cut off your clitoris? Or your pussy lips? Fuck. Fuck! Whres ma reward? Whre s ma reward?!! - Hannah?! - Hannah? Hannah? Hannah?! Hannah! Hannah... No! No, no, no, no, no. Hannah! Here! There's someone here! I'm no whore, you fucking prick! Hannah! Hannah! I'm no whore, you fucking prick! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey, sweetheart. I'm here. I'm here. Everything's gonna be fine. Shhh. It's all good. My name is Rebecca Schwintowski. Your hands are cold. We gotta warm you up. Burn in hell! Oh my God! Oh my God! My baby! KEY - Hold her up! - My Baby! - Higher! - You got her? You're safe now. I got you. I got you, baby. I got you. It's over now. It's over. It's over. Professor Herzfeld? Linda! Hey! Where were you? I was looking for you. Packing my stuff. - How's Ender? - He's stable. Stable. - He'll make it. - He's amazing. He can really take it. Yeah. I am... Linda... You saved my daughter and I... Oh. What was that for? - Why'd I do that? - Yeah. Where the fuck should I even start? For the record: in the comic I'm gonna make outta all this you're not gonna look good! You can't... Yeah, but the comic 'll turn into a real hit I can guarantee you and one day you'll thank me. Listen up! - I should smack you another time. - Hey... - What will you do next? - I'm gonna go home. There's a few things I need to take care of. - Danny? - Pfff! I'll show him not to fuck around. And my lawyer said... ...all those fucked up text messages will probably help us. Thank you, Linda. Be seeing you. Be seeing you. Hey! Take care of your daughter, yeah? I'm not helping you again. I will. I sure will. Linda? And you sure you wouldn't prefer taking the boat? Nah, with this we're home in two hours. Gotta take the bodies to Berlin anyway. My father always preferred hanging out with the dead than with real living people. There is a manhunt all over the island for Jan Sadler. And he can't leave the island. Oh, I know they'll get him. Why don't you fly to Berlin with us. I know your car is, err... There's a new one waiting for me in Cuxhaven. In something like that? I wouldn't get in that for all the tea in China. Ingolf, I... Thanks for everything. Really, for everything. I'll be getting in touch. Hannah, away from the door! Land dis mow! Aaaah!
