(footsteps rustling) (gentle music) (engine whirring) (aircraft radio playing) (music continues) (aircraft radio continues intermittently) (music intensifies) (acoustic music) - [Freddie] Most people have never heard of the Great Gorge in the Shadow of Denali, but we keep coming back here year after year. (guitar music continues) - [Renan] In the lower 48, everything's really busy, people moving around, running off to their jobs or responsibilities. (guitar music continues) You're in a world that's white and black, sometimes golden rock. And that's about it. It's a pretty special place. - [Zack] You know, usually you go somewhere and there's one, two truly inspiring world-class peaks. And this, this gorge is just full of them. - [Freddie] It's always been just kind of below the radar because the climbs are all really challenging. It's not the place you come to bag some easy ascents. It's more of a place, you know, for people who don't mind failing and kind of like to like to flog themselves. Like the beat down. - [Renan] 14 Hours in. And yeah, there's a lot of rock up there. (wind blowing) - [Freddie] For young climbers who are out there seeking adventures, and little swaths of mountain to explore where nobody's been, the big challenge is like finding any blank spots that are left. - [Renan] When you do discover a big climb, that's never been done, it kind of feels like falling in love. - [Freddie] Who knows why some ideas spark into obsessions, but this one took seven years, and it all started with a black and white photograph. - [Renan] Anzel Adams wrote, "you recognize the explorer in Bradford Washburn at first sight. There's something about the eyes, the set of the chin, not fierce, just determined. He doesn't immediately remind on of the vast bulk of Denali, but he has in fact conquered this extraordinary mountain three times. Not only Denali has commanded his eye and heart, the Grand Canyon, the great peaks of the Western Yukon and the Himalaya have all come under his acquiring attention and the well-directed eye of his camera." - [David] Brad didn't have many mentors himself. He was too much his own man, too self-taught. But, photographically, the great influence on him was Vittorio Sella. Sella's dictum was big subjects need big photographs. Brad would quote this all the time. - [Bradford] Use big negatives to take big subjects. There's nothing like Mount McKinley or any one of the great peaks of Alaska when photographed with a camera like this. - [John] One of his favorite cameras in the early days was a Fairchild camera. Something that was really developed for flying over cities and mapping them for wartime, military reconnaissance. And these large cameras were very heavy, very hard to use, all manual. - [Bradford] The crank would advance the film and also set the shutter. They would put it in and it would go. And I want to show you the size of the spool of the film we've got in here. Now this takes a 125 eight by ten inch pictures in a single roll. I will take this out and show you it and look at that compared with a little bit of an ordinary roll that carries 36 35 millimeter pictures. - [David] But what Brad realized that almost no one before had been able to figure out how to solve was that when you look at a big mountain from the base, well, it looks like four fifths of the way up is actually only halfway up. If you get up in an airplane and see it from mid height, you're getting a God's eye view of the peak as it really looks. We all know Ansel Adams' famous picture of Denali from Wonder Lake, but in Brad's pictures, you see that same face from midair. And it's so much more stunning. (orchestral music) - [Kurt] One year I got a book of Bradford Washburn's, and as I looked at it, I had that sense of beginning all over that I didn't really know anything. With Brad's pictures, suddenly I saw mountains as individuals that they stood among other mountains. Brad takes something colossal and makes it human. - [John] He's the greatest aerial mountain photographer of all time bar none. - I can talk to the pilot and say, get that left wing a little higher. Now, pull back your stick. And in that way, the pilot is framing the picture of shoot me rather than they trying to play around with it, with the camera. (orchestral music) When I can I like to get a little figure in to give some idea of the magnitude of the scene. (orchestral music) - [John] You look at this colossal landscape and suddenly you realize down in the corner, there are two tiny little figures. - [Mike] He knew that you couldn't really appreciate this, large landscape until you had scale or to sort of give people that just visceral feeling of being in the middle of this vast wilderness. (orchestral music) - [Brian] He knew the mountains through a mountaineer's eyes, a person who wasn't a climber wouldn't photograph in the same way he did. - [John] But do you think he devoted himself to the printing, making beautiful prints? No, he was happy with an eight by 10 contact and he could draw on it so he could show climbers, Hey, try this. This could be a first descent. - [David] Before Brad got on the scene in the early 1930s, the Alaska range had had a handful of monumental ascents but all the other peaks were unclimbed. He was like, my God, let's go get them before somebody else does. - [Bradford] In a way, we were lucky to be able to go into that wilderness and be the first people to see it. Those were experiences that people are very rare to have nowadays. - [Freddie] I was going up to Alaska every spring, working as a guide on Denali. And on days off in Talkeetna, I'd go down to the ranger station where they have this great resource of old Brad Washburn photos. Just looking for inspiration for something new to climb. And for some reason, I kept on circling back to the Moose's Tooth in some of the shots of the range. The Moose's Tooth is known as this iconic complex peak that's the centerpiece of the Great Gorge. It's less of a singular mountain and more like a jawbone of many interconnected spiky teeth. Most of the summits had been climbed, but nobody had tried to traverse all of them in a single go. Spring of 2009, I was traveling through Colorado with a good friend of mine, Micah Dash, and Micah and I ended up in Boulder, crashing on the couch of his friends Renan and Zack. They were heading to Alaska that spring to the Ruth Gorge. And one night after a few beers, I let my secret slip about the Tooth Traverse. - It was certainly one of the most creative lines I'd ever seen. It's a type of climb where you're climbing on a skyline the entire time. It's like you're always on a summit. - [Freddie] Later that spring, we all sort of went our separate ways. I went home to New Hampshire. Micah left on an expedition to China. - [Micah] Probably snowing at midnight or so. It's about five now, just kind of hanging out in this pretty sick location. - And Renan and Zack were about to leave for Alaska. When one day we got this phone call. The bodies of our friends in China and just been found. - My life is completely driven by the mountains. And it's given me some of the best experiences, but also the worst and probably the time where it hit hardest on that negative side was when we got the call that Johnny and Micah had died in an avalanche in China. Micah held my hand and brought me into the climbing community. And to lose someone that close to you is something that affects you deeply. But in the face of that, Zack and I still decided to go to the Ruth Gorge. We left just a few days after the memorial ceremony and went into the mountains, not knowing what we would do. It's super counter intuitive to have your best friends die and then head straight into the mountains and do something equally as dangerous. But after a certain amount of time for us, it was just healthy to go to a space that was quiet and beautiful, where we could process our own thoughts. (acoustic music) It took a few days, but eventually the mountains pulled us in and we were there and we decided to go test ourselves. We look over at the Tooth Traverse, which our friend Freddie had told us about. And it became obvious that that was the objective. There was no planning. Our head space was fucked. We pretty much just tried it on a whim. (stream trickling) So the climb begins to express a gap. Nice job, dude. - [Zack] Pretty sweet, woo! - [Renan] We were so unprepared that we were extremely light and the conditions were really, really warm. And that allowed us to make it really far, really fast. - [Zack] Anyone. - [Renan] You're able to make it past the big corner sections of the eye tooth very quickly. We made it all the way up until that unknown unclimbed section between the missing tooth and the bear's tooth. (groans) We hit that section after we basically sat and shivered the night on a small ledge. - [Zack] It was a long night for a place that doesn't get dark. - [Renan] When we got up in the morning, it was clear that neither one of us was really feeling it. What's the deal with that guy? - [Zack] This guy right here is off of Micah's chess set. We spent a lot of time playing and that chess set went to China and came back. Came back to us. If you look, it kinda looks like him. The big nose, beady eyes full of attention. So just a nice little piece to bring along. Little piece of Micah right there looking after us. It's perfect, huh? - [Renan] I'm really glad we have it. - Yeah! - [Renan] We had just come from the funeral with hundreds of people in the community weeping, and you have to push it on some of those climbs. It's just how it goes. But for the sake of the community and for the sake of our friends and family, it just wasn't the time to take another one of those risks. As soon as we got down, we knew we had to contact Freddie because he's the one who saw the line on Washburn's photo in the first place. (acoustic music) - At the end of 2009, I was trying to simultaneously be a climbing guide, a freelance writer and good partner to Janet. We were living in this small 12 by 12 cabin we built. We chose to live that way without a flushing toilet or a shower or even a closet. But we did have this incredible freedom to pack up and leave for a three month expedition if we wanted. Then one day I got an email from Renan and Zack and lo and behold, they had gone and tried the Tooth Traverse. (gentle music) I wasn't upset or wronged. Nobody owns these mountains. But I would have been disappointed if they had just walked up to the climb and done it. At the same time, it didn't surprise me at all that they had failed. The Tooth Traverse is a big, big route to piece together. And it has a lot of snow climbing and steep ridge traverses. And that sort of climbing suits my strengths. So the more we talked about it, the more it was obvious, we should just go up there the next spring and give it a try as a team of three. At the time, I didn't know much about Brad Washburn beyond the photos, but the more I got psyched on the climb, the more I became fascinated by his story. And it began right here in the mountains of New Hampshire. - [Bradford] For the first 10 years of my life, I had perfectly terrible hay fever. And I've had a cousin who took me up to the top of Mount Washington, the summer of 1921, which got me immediately interested in climbing. Because every time I went on a trail up a mountain, there was no hay fever. - [Mike] He had a loving family that encouraged exploration of the mind and the physical exploration. They came from some wealth. So they had a summer home up in the white mountains. You had a mother who gave to her young son, a small little pocket camera where he learned, self-learned had to take photographs. When he was in the white mountains, he was making hand drawn maps of Squam Lake. So you have this affinity for cartography. Years later, Alaska combined all of his talents with opportunities. - [Bradford] My first trip to Alaska was 1930, we organized during my freshman year, we wanted to climb Mount Fair weather. - [David] He had the tremendous fear of failure. The only two failures among his expeditions were his first three, the Fair weather and Crillon. Every time after that, he got to the summit. And those early failures really fueled his perfectionism and his high achieving. - [David] The map that they had of the region was woefully under representing the landscape. It almost told you nothing. (adventurous music) When I read the early accounts of exploration, all I can think about is a circus act without a net. There was no one to come save them. - [Brian] Many of these early exhibitions used horses for packing your gear in. The bugs were just eating the men and horses alive. The rivers were cold, swift, full of glacier silt. - [David] From a geographic standpoint, Alaska was this unknown territory. But Brad's use of the airplane transformed it because to be up in the air, it allowed him to take the photographs, but he'd also used those photos to create maps. - [Brian] He was able to correlate with the aerial photography, very accurately the position of everything in the range, including the Ruth Gorge. And the range comes alive in his map. - [John] When you think about exploration, it all comes down to logistics. With the advent of the aircraft, suddenly you had a perspective where you could see over that next hill, you could see over that next range. You can map out large distances because you could see hundreds of miles. Brad was always looking at aviation technology and how he could leverage that to get a better view of the mountains and whether it was for route finding or whether it was for beauty or whether it was for cartography. And he took advantage of the next aircraft, the next camera. - [Interviewer] When was the first time you felt like a real connection with the device known as a camera? - It was actually probably pretty late in my life that | first felt a connection to a camera. (laughing) - [Interviewer] You can't say it like that. That sounds like you have a-. (laughing) - Okay. - [Interviewer] Sexual relationship with the camera. (both laughing) - I had the first-. - [Interviewer] Did you see that? - The first time I fondled a camera was probably in 2005. (acoustic music) I was doing a lot of artwork. And then there came this point where I realized you could reach a lot more people shooting with cameras. Brad's photography taught me that you could use these tiny human elements to convey the scale of these massive landscapes. (yelling in distance) On the first trip with Zack, we had cameras, but they were pretty basic. - Just another day off at the tent. Mmm. (grunts) (acoustic music continues) - [Renan] I think I shot 87% of the thing on fish eye adapt or. I've since learned that it's not the most professional way to shoot, but at the time it looked pretty cool to me, kind of like old school skate videos. By the time of the second attempt of the Tooth Traverse, all of our lives had evolved. Both Freddie and myself had gained sponsors and we became professional climbers. Freddie was a budding writer who had just finished his first book and his work were starting to get picked up by bigger and bigger publications. You want to grab the pot off the stove for one sec, Zack? (indistinct) Zack in my mind, he was a much more talented climber than we were, but he just didn't have that gene of self promotion. And part of being a professional climber in this day and age is how you tell stories. - [Zack] It seemed like overnight, everybody I knew became a professional climber. It became harder for me to find partners, ironically. There was always like, you know, there had to be a photographer, there had to be, you know, some kind of spin to going out climbing. And I just wanted to keep going climbing. - [Renan] What are you thinking, Zack? - Why we've come here for the second year in a row to try this silly thing. It's been cute about it. Most days can get a little obsessive like that, looking at pictures way too long. Maybe, maybe we'll get lucky. (gentle orchestral music) - [Freddie] The crux of the traverse would be the South face of the Moose's tooth. It's right in the middle of the traverse. And it's about a 2000 foot big wall. And it had never been climbed before. We decided to go and do a recon and try that section as it's own first ascent to see if the full traverse was even possible. - [Renan] People in town had said, oh, that's a lost cause, it's been tried, the rock just goes to shit and it's hard to climb. - [Zack] So is the anchor a sign that someone's already tried this way and failed? (laughs) But whoever they were, they weren't Zach Smith. - [Renan] We saw some fixed gear where people had bailed off of. People had decided it wasn't worth the risk. Beautiful day in the gorge. The rock is so bad. You can just go like this with your hand and a whole sheet will fall off. (hammer banging against rock) - [Freddie] There's Zack and there's Renan. This lead will probably take a couple hours, see how Renan does with it. Rock fall, woohoo! Gnarly. (gentle music continues) They're okay. I'm just going to chill here and hope for the best. Looking a little ugly, turn that thing around. - [Renan] Tried to hold this pin, and I took a chunk out of my finger. - [Freddie] How bad is it? - It's not bad, it's just like that whole right side. You see? (orchestral music) - [Renan] Take it to the top, Freddie. - Gonna try. Close. (dramatic orchestral music) - Is this it? - This is it. - We did it? - We did it! Good day, got a summit. It's always a good day when you get to the top. - Not a bad first rope up. (all laughing) Sick! (laughing continues) She goes, she goes! (laughing) - [Renan] The big mystery is solved. - [Zack] The mystery is solved! - [Renan] When we get to the top of the Moose's Tooth and figured out that section, we had the confidence that the entire traverse was possible. - Get the boys. - Yeah! - Climbed the South face of the Moose's Tooth a couple days ago. And we're gonna go go try the traverse tomorrow. Weather's just been splitter, so we're pretty psyched. (orchestral music) - [Renan] Getting the conditions right on the Tooth Traverse is really, really hard. If it's warm, like you want for rock climbing, the snow conditions could be out of whack and totally shut you down. But then if the snow conditions are right, it's probably too cold for the technical route climbing, and any single storm could wipe out the route for the entire season. Something's always going to be bad. (dramatic music) - [Freddie] Funky weather. - [Renan] Lingering slowly. - [Freddie] It is just fucking warm. - [Zack] Warm temps. It was splitter two hours ago. - [Renan] Pressure's dropped as well. We'll probably have a restless night of sleep and wake up at two and see what the conditions are and make a good decision. (dramatic music) - [David] The worst part of any climb is the anticipation. Every time you go up, you know that you're committing to a life or death situation. So there's no way of avoiding that kind of psychological stress. We've all had close calls, we've all lost friends. So any climb is jinxed by self-doubt and self-criticism. Am I too soft, or is the mountain too hard? - [Jack] Often conditions aren't right. Partner problems, or, you know, the weather's bad or whatever. You gotta live today to climb tomorrow. - [Mike] Brad pushed, he took risks, but these were always calculated risks. When someone else said, that's really stupid, you shouldn't do that. Brad would figure out a way to do it, but it would be calculated. - [David] In 1937, just months before Amelia Earhart tried to execute her around the world flight, Earhart and her husband, George Put man, invited Brad down to White Plains and asked Brad's opinion about the logistics of it. She needed a navigator. - [Mike] Going to a place unknown and doing something that no one else had done before. He very much wanted to do this. - [Bradford] We chatted for a weekend. I remember, and we were going map over map and we got to How land Isle. It's all by itself. A mile and a quarter long and a quarter of a mile wide, just a sliver out in the middle of nothing. I said, Amelia, you've absolutely got to have a noise on a specific frequency emanating from that island. Could be duh, duh, duh, dah, duh, duh, duh, dah, duh, dit, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dit. And you hone on that as you're getting close to it. - Putnam and Earhart looked at each other in dismay and Putnam, according to Brad said, then the book won't come out in time for the Christmas sales. - [Bradford] And I said, I'm sorry, I don't want any part of that. I just don't think it makes sense. (upbeat classical music) - Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred No on an, have come to grief in their perilous round the world flight. The two intrepid fliers missed the tiny dot that is How land island in their 25 mile hop from New Guinea and were forced down by lack of fuel. (dramatic orchestral music) - [David] The perfectionism was a virtue and a fault. Every story he ever told he was in the right and the others, the doubters were in the wrong. It's another Brad I told you so story. - [Interviewer] Kind of the mother of all that. (both laughing) (gentle acoustic music) - [David] In 1937, Brad wanted to fly into the Walsh Glacier to climb Mount Lucania, the highest unclimbed peak in North America. - [Bradford] Lucania was a very tempting morsel to take. Walter Wood had made a serious attempt on it the preceding year, he got to the top of 16,000 foot Mount Steel and made the first ascent of that and to his horror, found that Lucania lay 10 miles away from that in the direction of Mount Logan. And he just said, I honestly don't think that anybody's ever gonna get to the top of that Mount. Well, nobody should ever say that. Particularly in Life magazine. (laughing) (pleasant music) I've been listening to tales about a guy called Bob Bree. And the way he was taking supplies up to high altitude mines. Taking off from the Valdez mudflats in a ski equipped airplane with skis that he'd put underneath it, that he'd got stainless steel from an old abandoned cocktail bar. So I wrote him a letter and told him what we wanted to do, to fly 250 miles in with no place to land all the way, and land on Walsh Glacier. And we hoped to climb Lucania and have him fly us back out. (film projector ticking) I got the telegram. Anywhere you'll ride, I'll fly, Bob Bree. (airplane propellers spin) (orchestral music) - [Paul] The flying back then, I mean, every time you went out, you didn't know whether you were even going to make it back. I mean, you might have to walk, you know, two or three weeks to make it back, 'cause planes, I mean, they just weren't as reliable back then. It was a serious endeavor. - [Bradford] If we cracked up there, the chances are 50/50 that they'd never even have found the airplane. We landed at 8,500 feet in the spot and exactly as planned, but it decelerated very, very fast. I jumped out the door when it stopped and went to my waist in slush. None of us expected that at that altitude in Alaska, even in mid June, it would be slush. There was no way he'd be able to take that airplane home. We couldn't even taxi it up to camp, and left it sitting like that for the night. We wondered would we ever get it out of there. - [David] It took five days and stomping out of runways and throwing everything out of the plane. We've even took a ball-peen hammer and changed the pitch of the propeller with it so they could get a sharper bite. (airplane propeller spins) - [Bradford] Bob said, the only thing I'm telling you guys now is, I wouldn't come back to this God damn place for a million bucks. So he gave his airplane the gun, headed down the glacier and there was a little bulge there and he completely disappeared from sight. But we could hear this roar in the distance. Finally, this little mosquito appeared in the air heading back to the Valdez, 250 miles away. And we felt like a long way off ourselves. - [David] And he barely wobbled into the air as he took off, leaving Brad and Bob Bates to their own devices. No hope of picking them up later. We've never even flew back to check on the guys. (stove top hissing) - [Freddie] Okay, eggs. Actually there's bacon, right under the eggs. - [Zack] It's getting pretty cold, huh? - [Renan] Yeah. - [Freddie] And it seems like I would probably have at least a thousand feet of chains to Espresso Gap. So, hopefully, 1500 feet above us, it would be a good, hard cruise. - [Renan] Oh yeah, this is as good as it's gonna get. - [Narrator] The first peak step one is the Sugar Tooth. It's a long convoluted rock climb with small snow sections in between. - Keep your helmets on and your heads down on this. (orchestral music) - [Renan] Nice Zack, hauling. When you're climbing on the Sugar Tooth, you're constantly tip-toeing across these knife blades of rock that can bite you at any moment. - [Freddie] As the day got warmer and the conditions steadily got worse, we were forced to choose between slogging up deep wet snow slopes or engaging in this really ticky-tacky rock climbing up and around steep towers with sharp edges. - [Renan] Sugar Tooth. - Sugar Tooth! - [Renan] Good old Sugie. - Good old Sugie. Kind of, there packing a little bit of a punch. How's it look? (dramatic music) Ow. Stupid idea. Fuck you. No slack. (chains clinking) - [Zack] Yeah just good finger lock, a little higher. - [Renan] That's a funny way to charge. - Check fuckin' this donkey out. - [Renan] I slipped following Zack and the rope came tight over a blade of rock and nearly cut in half. And then shortly after that, I foolishly dropped my ice tool. And that meant I was never going to be secure on any of the snow climbing from that point on. (dramatic music) - [Freddie] It's like this mountain is going to kill you because it's just going to beat your equipment down to the point where it fails. - [Renan] Baking in the heat. Instead of easily scampering across the top of the snow, we kept punching through to our waists, expending tons of energy way too early in the climb. - [Zack] Sug' sunny! - [Freddie] We're at the summit of the Sugar Tooth. Psyched about that, but definitely a humbling day, first day on route. And we just slogged really hard, so. Gotta talk to Renan and Zach and see what they want to do. (laughing) I think I kind of want to like pitch the tent and crawl in the man sack and just try to reboot tomorrow morning, (laughing) but we'll see. - [Renan] It's beautiful out. - [Zack] That was like the main pitch that I was worried about. - [Renan] Yeah. (rustling) - [Renan] Man won and the configuration tucked. - [Freddie] My next. - [Renan] So today was a speeder or a crashed out early, getting some good rest after the 16 hour push from base camp through the horrendous snow conditions and wet rock. So, we're gonna get up early and get the second tooth in the morning, hopefully continue on from there. (energetic music) - [Freddie] A little rock climb today for most of like the morning. We probably would want to do like a siesta. Alright, you ready for this guy? Ah, it was so good for a while. - [Renan] When we woke up on that second day, there was a lot of questions that needed to be answered in terms of if it was going to be safe enough. And if it was a responsible decision to move on. - [Freddie] It looks like about 20 meters of down climbing. Does that sound good? - [Renan] Yeah. - [Zack] Sure. - [Freddie] It's pretty funny. We're like 20 hours into this mission. - [Zack] Yeah. - [Freddie] Renan and I made it here in like five or six hours. - [Zack] Yeah. - [Freddie] That's just the way, I mean, I knew that was gonna be case. - [Zack] Yeah. - [Freddie] Yeah, I think we can still make it happen, but, you know. - [Renan] We didn't use our full reserve or anything, It's-. - Yeah. - [Renan] Anyway, we do it it's definitely not going to be cas', but there's a few factors. - [Freddie] We can charge, chances of pulling the whole thing off, pretty small. You know, that's just one more-. - [Zack] We're a day be- we're kind of a day behind, too. - Almost, yeah. - [Zack] I mean, we went with it, we rolled it, it's cool. - If the forecast was good. - [Zack] I just feel like the writing's on the wall. - Yeah. - It's not cut and dry to call it, like it usually is. - [Renan] That's the smart thing to do. - [Freddie] Yeah. - All right. - [Renan] Earlier on in our careers, we might've gone kamikaze on it, but the more you get out and you do these things or lose friends to the mountains, the more careful you are and the better decisions you make. So this is the way to play it safe. Possibly have another go at it. (somber piano music) (upbeat piano music) - [Freddie] The day after we came down after that attempt, we figured we should switch out our equipment and try it again. But then when we were down at base camp, the temperatures remained unseasonably warm. Here comes one. And it just was raining down wet avalanches and rock fall all over the lower Gorge. Three, two, one. (laughing) (loud rumbling) - [Renan] It's really unstable right now, it's obvious. - [Freddie] Yeah. The party next to us when to try a gullied climb. And I got a really bad feeling about it. By midday, they still hadn't come back. And I finally decided to ski over there a little closer and have a look for them. (somber music) We found their bodies buried in avalanche debris at the bottom of the gully. (helicopter whirs) - [Zack] Now the Rangers are in, so this is the recovery. - [Bradford] I think it's important to point out that there is something that happens to both the brilliant climbers and the bum ones. And that's tough luck. I've never believed in what I call Russian roulette climbing, which is going into a place where you have constant danger over which you have no control at all. I think one of the reasons that we're still here and chatting with you today is the fact we refused to take that kind of challenge. - [David] Brad in his whole life never went on an expedition led by anybody else. He was a good guy and he would consult you, but he was the leader and his decision finally stuck. - [Bradford] On all these trips, the trip was my idea, and maybe I knew more about climbing. So I was sort of the logical leader, let's take Lucania where Bob Bates and I were alone. And we got along very, very well. - [David] Brad and Bob Bates were complete opposites. Brad, the headstrong leader, had to do it his way. Bob was the nicest guy in the world, the most generous. Yet he had an incredible talent to be in a ticklish situation and to chill out and calm down. - [John] They had all the gear, all the food and supplies, and they decided rather than just hightailing it out, that they would go ahead and climb Mount Lucania. - [Bradford] We could've walked out two ways, 200 miles back into Alaska. Or if we remembered that Walter Wood who said Lucania was impossible to climb had said so from the top of Mount Steel, and we figured if we climbed Lucania, we could get over the top of Mount Steel. And we would be going back into Canada. - [John] They'd pioneer a new style, which I call fast and light. Once they committed to going over Lucania and Steel, they stripped down radically, they cut the floor out of their tent. They threw away one sleeping bag and slept head to toe. The two of them in a single bag. And they threw out a lot of food. - [Bradford] We were out for a hell of a long time. We started at eight in the morning, it was four in the afternoon when we got to the top. (orchestral music) 19,000 foot Mount Logan in one direction, all the way down the coast to St. Elias. The view was absolutely magnificent. That was the first ascent of Mount Lucania. - [John] They were so sanguine that Brad took what I argue is the finest summit photo yet taken in the far North. It's just a stunning portrait of both exhaustion and jubilation. - [Bradford] But the biggest problem we had on that trip was not climbing Mount Lucania. We figured that anything that Walter Wood could get up, we could get down. And he told us exactly where we would find a huge cache of food on the other side. So we walked down for the longest set, we were went from 14,000 feet to 16,000 feet to get to the top of Steel. And then from 16,000 feet, all the way down to the head of the Wolf Creek glacier at 5,000 feet, all in one day, it was an endless day. And the next day we walked all the way down to the cache of food. The bears had been in the cache and there was not one single thing left. The bears had chewed every single can. It was 19 miles from that cache to the Donjeck river. And we got to the Donjeck river and it was in full flood. - [John] In desperation, they took the camera and the notebooks and the film and hung it on a bush with a note saying, you know, if you find these at least you'll know what happened to us, basically sort of recognizing that their chance of survival was getting pretty slim, perhaps none. - [Bradford] We had two duffel bags with all our clothing and everything and we tied them up real, really tight. And we jumped into the river and we went in as deep as we could on foot. When we lost our footing, we used them like life preservers. And we swum to the other shore. We were sitting down on a bunch of tussocks and all of a sudden we heard a tinkling sound. I began to wonder if I was hearing the bells of heaven or something. And then all of a sudden, a hundred yards away, we saw a man and then another man, and these guys said, where in hell have you come from? We said, we've come from Valdez, Alaska. And they said, where were you going? We said, we're going any place you're going. - [John] Fortunately, they were able to go back and get that camera. But I think that Mount Lucania expedition is one of the most incredible stories of drive and survival. - [Mike] Brad and Bob Bates. Both of those men had shrugged it off as, well, you know, we just kinda walked out. - [Interviewer] Did anybody end up injured on that trip? - [Bradford] Nobody. Nobody got a skinned ankle on it, everything went fine. - [David] Brad was very proud of the fact that in all his 13, 15 expeditions, you know, they never lost a partner. He never had a partner suffer a serious accident. But I discovered when I wrote Brad's biography, Brad himself had become a pilot in his twenties. And as far as I know, he was a very good pilot. - [Interviewer] Flying wasn't exactly safe when you began flying, was it? Ever have any narrow escapes? - [Bradford] Well, I had one. Way back in 1938. - [David] 1938, he'd been in Seattle on Lake Union. And had taken out a float plane, the wife of a climbing buddy of his and another woman just to do a routine sightseeing trip. Perfect day in Seattle. Brad came in, in the float plane he'd only flown once before and screwed up the landing. The plane sank. Brad and the guy, punched out the windshield and swam to safety. And then dived back in to try to rescue the two women. They both drowned. (somber orchestral music) He never talked about this. I only learned about this from extensive research into newspaper clippings. This was a dark, dark thing for, especially for such a perfectionist as Brad to have really fucked up and killed two women who thought they were out on the 30 minute sightseeing flight. He was terribly disturbed by it the rest of his life. It's why he never flew again. - [Renan] Just two months before we were supposed to head back to Alaska, Zack and I were in Colorado. Spending most of our time climbing and training together. - [Zack] This climb means a lot to me. I really, really want it bad. I've never put this much time and energy into one climb before I've never tried to climb this complicated. And I made a lot of sacrifices to try something like this. Right now, I'm living in a good friend's basement in Boulder, Colorado, and I'm recently single after an eight year relationship. We had a really amazing relationship for a long time. And the stress of me traveling and climbing became too great on that relationship. And the reality of really close friends of ours dying played a huge part of it I think, because it made her worst nightmares a reality. And so the idea of something like that happening to me and you know, me putting myself in those situations was too much for her. And I can't blame her for that. (dramatic music) - [Nurse] I want you to squeeze my fingers, Okay? Good. - [Zack] Two months before we were due to leave for Alaska, for another attempt on the Moose's Tooth, Renan was filming some professional skiers in the Tetons. - [Nurse] Open your mouth for me, make sure you don't have any broken teeth, good. - [Zack] Catches an edge, tumbles down the mountain, over a cliff band and lands on his head. (radio plays indistinctly) We're lucky as partners we're able to get them down to the base of the mountain and on a life flight to advanced medical support. - [Paramedic] One, two, three. - [Zack] The way I first heard about it was an hysterical phone call from Renan's girlfriend. That was like basically Renan's dead or is, you know, going to be quadriplegic for the rest of his life. And I was at work and so I just threw down whatever I was doing and drove over to their house and tried to, you know, get the details. - [Freddie] He had a depressed skull fracture, broken two vertebrae and severed the one of the two vertebral arteries that supply blood flow to the brain. (speaking indistinctly) - Headed to the neurosurgeon, realize that this'll probably work out, but it does hurt me pretty deeply to not to be involved in all the projects that are going on, especially the Tooth Traverse, because that's something that you put, it's something that we put three years of time into. And after everyone said it couldn't be done, (walkie talkie sounds intermediately) We solved a few of the major problems and showed that it was possible last year and right now that's, that was the one thing. I really want it, so. It's tough. (somber piano music) - [Freddie] When it happened I figured the climb was over, at least for that year. I mean, the question was were we gonna go without him? - [Renan] We have loved ones back home that I'm sure would be destroyed if we lost our life in the mountains. I can only imagine what my funeral would be like. It's about five months later, technically I'm still healing a broken neck in two places, two vertebrae, like right in my spinal column. And I can touch my head and feel where the skull is still tender from having it sliced open for brain surgery, Getting injured just before we had to leave on the trip was really devastating. And I knew it was going to be really hard for them to deal with the fact that I was out of commission. - [Freddie] Renan's at home with his neck immobilized in a brace and he's Skyping with me every day, talking about, you know, we're going to go back to the Tooth Traverse next year. So, so we waited. - [Chiropractor] And on this side, you can see the needle swing. (grunts) I gotta get down lower. - [Renan] I've worked really hard to recover as fast as I have. I just been sitting for so long. I need to go out and push myself and be in the mountains and create. (gentle music) As a professional climber, I have these competing priorities. First I wanted to climb in the Himalaya with my North Face team and then go back to the Tooth Traverse in the spring. When I thought the conditions were gonna be pretty good. This didn't sit well with Zack. He wanted to get back to Alaska as soon as possible. - [Zack] Renan has made an incredible recovery and by some kind of miracle, the guy was going to be able to climb. You know, I said, let's go try this thing again. You know, like we've talked about going in the fall before. Let's, why not. But he made another choice, which is great. You know, like his other project is super rad and I'm sure they'll succeed. Those guys are professional climbers who get to go on big trips. So those guys have a different climbing experience than I have. My last Alpine climbing trip was a two month trip. It's the longest expedition I've ever been on, down in Argentina. Two months, pretty much spent all the money I had and I climbed one day and with no summit. So that was a bit hard, you know, to sacrifice the time and energy and money that I put towards it, it is a big thing to me. To me the filming has just become a distraction and taking away from the actual experience of climbing. I'm just at this tipping point where the mountains are taking more than they're giving. Hanging Christmas lights, painting out for a living. Yeah. (laughs) - [Camera Man] Pretty crazy. - It's a weird way to make a living, but it works. So I made the decision to bow out of the climb. We created this monster (engine starts up) And I just hope they finish the fucking thing. Even if I can't be there, I just want it done. - [Renan] I almost lost everything in my accident. People always ask me, why do you do it? I just wanted to use the chance that I was given to show that there's this joyous side of climbing. (gentle piano music) - [Bradford] We've added a lot to opening people's eyes towards the beauty of these places and making it easier if you're a climber to find new routes. The things that you remember about these trips are people, not things. Being with these wonderful people. - Yeah, that was a sharp spin. (screaming) - [Freddie] When you're on an expedition, most of the time, it doesn't feel like you're risking your life. It feels like you're on this incredible journey to explore the landscape. Hello, beautiful wife. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Janet] Yeah, you good? - [Freddie] I'm actually good, what a day. - I always say I don't care about summits, but really does feel good. - [Bradford] I'm going to tell you the most important thing in my whole life- Barbara. That's the best step I ever took from the day I was born until this afternoon. - [Barbara] Brad never talked about mountain climbing when we got engaged. But when we were first married, I found myself on my way to Mount Birther in South Eastern Alaska. - [Interviewer] Well, why did you think Barbara was up for this? I mean most people would not-. - Just because I think Barbara's terrific, and she still is. - [Barbara] I don't think he had any idea whether I was up to it or not, he just wanted me to go. - [Bradford] That was the first time Barbara had ever done anything of this sort and she rushed right up and did it without the slightest difficult. - [Interviewer] In '47, you became the first woman to climb McKinley. - Yes. - [Interviewer] And that was a long, long expedition. - Yes, three months. - [Interviewer] Three months? - [Barbara] Three months, because we were making a map, making a movie. (twangy guitar music) When we got near the top, I was in the middle, Shorty Lang said, okay, Barbara, now you go first. And I said, oh no, no, no. We just go in the order we're in, of course. And he said, don't you realize you're the first woman to get to the top of this place? And I said, oh, heck, who cares about that? I didn't think the world cared about a woman getting to the top. Never done it if I knew it was gonna be such a fuss. Anyway, so I got to the top. And then Brad came up and joined us. (orchestral music) - [Bradford] It's been wonderful for me over the years to have a wonderful partner like Barbara, all the way through this stuff. - [Mike] To sort of sum Brad up is really hard. He was an educator, a scientist, explorer. But he would always land on the education because no matter what he did, he educated. - [Bradford] The thing that made the climb fun was the fact we were trying to create something that would share the thrill of discovery. This sharing doesn't just apply to climbing. It also applies to our Museum of Science. - [John] The Museum of Science. When he took it over, it was this derelict old attic of a junk heap in South Boston. Brad absolutely transformed it into the, one of the great teaching museums in the world. And he actually had said often that was the thing he wanted to be remembered for, above and beyond the climbing and the photography. - [Kurt] Photography was always, I think in second place to his idea of scientific adventure. Not just adventure, but scientific adventure. - [John] There are parallels amongst scientific exploration and human exploration. All of it comes down to our drive to want to know or want to see new places. Flying on the Space Shuttle is just an amazing place to do photography. From space, you can see thousands of miles. 2009, you know, Brad had just passed away two years earlier. The American Alpine club offered to let me take Brad's camera, bringing Brad's legacy to the next generation of aerial photography to space. Truly incredible because that's the camera that he took on his Mount Lucania expedition. - [Bradford] I had quite a number of climbs, sort of in my hip pocket that I began parceling out one by one. I just sort of sit and wait and see how they did it. And I've had a lot of fun out of that, particularly after I got old enough. So I wasn't doing these wonderful climbs myself. - [David] When I was a undergraduate at Harvard, you freely gave of all your advice about Alaska, you let us-. - [Bradford] Yeah. - [David] You've played this role with an extraordinary number of young climbers. You can take Brad's pictures and seek out your next great expedition on them. - [Jack] A mentor is a hero of generosity. You know, Brad was a lot of things, but he was super generous. And I think, you know, it wasn't just my experience that was, you know, hundreds of people's experience. He would send us photograph, you know, unsolicited. What do you think about this? - [Mike] I think his photography will last a really long time, but to us climbers, I think what matters is not that he did the hardest climbs ever it's that he climbed remote, arduous, exhausting peaks. And he encouraged many other generations, including mine, to seek out the challenges that were beyond him and people like Freddie and Renan are still pursuing the Washburn challenges. - [Freddie] How did you describe the snow conditions, man? - [Man In Blue Coat] The gorge, we got probably a foot. - [Freddie] Uh huh. - And at the mountain it looked like there was at least two and a half. - [Freddie] Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, a foot in the last couple days. And then we had a storm before that too, then had a couple. It's the eye deep to nipple deep snow wallowing, yep, unconsolidated wallowing. - [Man In Blue Coat] Yeah, every single aspect I'd been on has been pretty miserable snow conditions. - Yeah, cool. They had just had the biggest snow storm of the year the week before we arrived. The mountains were covered in six feet of new snow. And everyone we met in Talkeetna warned us that it was a really bad time. - [Renan] We'd waited for two years for another crack at the Traverse, but it wasn't even about the climb anymore. We wanted to do something in the true spirit of Brad to come back with something to share. It's the 14th, three o'clock and we're launching. - [Freddie] And we're launching. We get to do it with only (indistinct). - [Paul] It's good to be a part of something that has a lot of pieces that you have to connect together. There are certain climbers, like they have a plutonium rod, you know, just burning inside of them. It's not just going up and getting something done. They're tying their whole life into the whole climb. (phone ringing) (sighs) - [Renan] Can you breath out a big cold breath here? The rumors were correct and the conditions were very snowy and the going was slow. - [Freddie] The thing was, might've taken 15 or 20 minutes longer working twice as hard. But I still got to the top of the pitch. It set a little light off in my head, and I, I realized like, maybe we can do this thing. We took it one pitch at a time. And we went back to our old bivy from 2010 at the top of the Sugar Tooth. - [Renan] We're at our bivy overlooking Denali and climbed for about 12 hours today. And even though it's still blazing sun out, I'm going to try to get some rest. That's the update. (thud) - [Freddie] Ah! - [Renan] What's going on over there, Freddie? - Digging for buried treasure. We found a bag of snacks left from the attempt two years ago. Not exactly a street legal maneuver, but this buys us another two days of climbing, which we may need. Day two, we started up the South Ridge of the eye tooth. The climbing got a lot steeper and the conditions are challenging enough. We have to pitch it out and stop and belay each other. It takes us all day to get to the summit of the eye tooth. Day three, there was a segment of unclimbed ridge connecting the eye tooth to the bear's tooth. - [Renan] This is deep Alaskan cornice ridge climbing, huge waves that are 200 feet tall. These waves of snow. And you don't want to climb on the top of the wave because the wave could collapse. And we've had friends die, not knowing where the point is on the wave, where you can actually be. You're tiptoeing on the backside of the wave for what seems like a mile. That was pretty real. We've been on the summit all day. Now it's just a matter of weather, but we're looking really good. - [Freddie] We knew if we could only make it to the summit of the bear's tooth, we'd be halfway home. (helicopter whirs) (man indistinctly speaking on radio) - [Renan] I think first you see it from the ridge line. And then you see Denali, we can kind of just be charging up the snow towards the summit. - [Paul] All right, we'll see you in a little bit. - [Renan] Okay, awesome. Thanks Paul. - [Paul] They're coming. - There's a lot riding on the next hour. (upbeat orchestral music) (radio buzzes) - [Bradford] Up the long delirious burning blue, I've topped the wind swept heights with easy grace. Where never Lark or even Eagle flew. And while his silent lifting mind, I've trod the high under-trespassed sanctity of space. Whip out my hand and touch the face of God. (orchestral music) (radio buzzes) - [Renan] Making it across that final section of ridge onto the summit of the bear's tooth was like unlocking the last piece of the puzzle. We were on the center of the Tooth Traverse in the most beautiful part of it. For us, it was just this fleeting moment in our concept of how long we were toiling on this climb. (triumphant orchestral music) - [Freddie] We figured when we reached the South face of the Moose's Tooth, we'd be on easy street because we had already climbed that section. Nice, Renan! Without Zack there, those pitches felt way harder than we remembered. There was a big snow field that was dripping water down on this five, 11 slab traverse. And Renan had to tiptoe across it doing really precise, insecure climbing. That was like the ultimate little. - Yes, Zack, I almost died on the pitch you pranced up in 20 minutes. (laughing) Once I got through the slab, Freddie led us through the Bleeder pitch towards the summit of the moose. (heavy breathing) - Denali looks cool. Renan and I realized that, here we are, and we're just about out of food and we pretty much had no choice, but to continue on. It took us all night to get across the summit ridge of the Moose's tooth. - [Renan] Been going for almost 24 hours. (yelling in distance) We've done the entire Tooth Traverse. Now we're just trying to finish up the moose. - [Freddie] Fuck yeah! By 6:00 AM the next morning we were stopping for another quick rest on the West summit of the Moose's tooth. Before we began repelling off the side of the mountain. - [Renan] Hour 30 probably of the push. It's kind of this unique feeling. - [Freddie] Dreaming. - Yeah, it's like a hallucination without hallucinogens, but you're doing things where one wrong step, you could die. So it's even more trippy. You just got to try to keep yourself together. Hour after hour. And we probably have six hours to go. - [Freddie] The last challenge of the climb was descending this gully down to the glacier at the bottom of the gorge and gully's are dangerous. And we were going into this one at the worst possible time. It was 4:00 PM in the afternoon. We had been on the go for 30 some odd hours. And all the circumstances were pointing to this being a bad call, but we had to get down. We didn't think it'd take us too long. And I realized how soft it was at that hour of the day and sat down and was seated past Renan as he's really intensely kicking steps down. - [Renan] There could have been this giant crevasse down there to eat us both up. But after he committed, of course, I was going to do the same. And we were just sliding like little kids. (orchestral music) (chains clinking) - [Freddie] Nice job! - [Renan] The first thing we did was we called Zack. He was excited for us. - [Freddie] All right, man! Hang loose. - [Renan] And he knew that he was this big driving force for the Tooth Traverse overall. - [Freddie] The thing I'll remember more than any other detail of the climb was how it felt when we returned to base camp. We just hung out in the tent, listening to music, the door wide open, looking out on the skyline we had just walked across. By all rights, we should have been exhausted and should've fallen asleep immediately, but we felt more energized than ever. Those moments come so rarely. We didn't want it to end. (orchestral music) (music ends suddenly) - [David] Brad's favorite quotations, which were touchstones for him, one is from Aristotle- quote, the search for truth-. - [Brad And David Simultaneously] Is in one way hard-. - [Bradford] And in another easy, for it is evident that no one of us can ever-. - [Renan] Master it fully. - [Freddie] Or use it wholly. Each one of us-. - [Renan] Adds to our understanding-. - [Bradford] Of the world around us. - [All] And from all the facts assembled-. - [Renan] Arises a certain grandeur. - [Freddie] Arises a certain grandeur. - [Bradford] Arises a certain grandeur. (orchestral music) (electronic music) (twangy guitar music)
