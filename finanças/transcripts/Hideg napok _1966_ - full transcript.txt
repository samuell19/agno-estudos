COLD DAYS From a novel by: Screenplay: Cinematography: Director: 1942. Suspecting an imminent revolt of Serbian guerillas, Hungarian authorities decree a police raid on B?cska county. The police raid turns into a retaliation. People are executed without investigation, hearing, or judicial sentence, including 2500 ethnic Serbians, and 800 Jews, many of them escorted to holes in the ice, shot and dumped in the water. 1943. The Hungarian Royal Military Court declares, that no military or political reason necessitated such an extreme retaliation. All commanding officers, including Lt. Gen. Ferenc Feketehalmy-Czeydner and Col. J?zsef Grassy, are brought to court. January, 1944. Prime defendants flee from justice and hide in Hitler's Germany, only to return after Hungary's German occupation. October, 1944. Former defendants are promoted to high rank. Lt. Gen. Feketehalmy-Czeydner is made into Vice-Secretary of Defense. Col. Grassy is promoted to Lt. Gen. rank. 1946. The case of the B?cska Massacre is brought to court again. All prime defendants are sentenced to capital punishment. All of these are facts. Our film is not about the prime defendants. It is not a reconstruction of the events. We just recall the memories and conversations of four minor defendants under custody. This is their version of the events. We are just quoting their words... What a tune! I once heard it sung at a burial... So many foreign songs! Are you even Hungarian? Are you sure you're not Slovak? Or Romanian? Or Polish? A sailor calls at many places... How could they count the dead? It's absurd. 3,309... Or those 299, crippled with age... "Crippled with age... " You can't establish that after the event! What do you think, major? What's the difference between "old"... and "crippled with age"? Nonsense. Four... Three... Five! Everything is chance! If I didn't happen... to leave my luggage at the station... no one could have appointed me the commander! A river fleet man! What does he know... about identity checking? It was an oversight, or a mistake. Anyhow it cost me two years. And who knows how much longer! Though, as far as orders permitted I tried to help. Six! A piece of good luck. Today I'd be sailing as a civilian! - Mine? - The Lieutenant's. - Again? - It's his. Where's mine? Sorry. We can't write you letters. Unfair! Why hasn't he any letters, Ensign Posdor? - I'm not married. - But I am! She doesn't write to you. - The tins? - Empty. I'd like to ask a favor. I wonder if I should... Please, do. Anything. I meant the letters... From your wife... I don't get you. What does she write about? Don't get me wrong. It's not the content. But the atmosphere... The sentences... A woman's sentence... Shall I read from her letters? - Shall I read from her letters? - Well, yes... But not quite... A second... I'll pick a suitable passage. No, don't select! Well, there are passages... Personal stuff... Jealous? Your wife is a stranger to me - Funny! - Your request is... Forget it! It was a whim. Tell me... Did you ever... deceive her? Did you ever think of any... other women? While... - I miss her so much - Not now! Before. Did it never happen? Well, of course... It did. If I only knew... where my wife is now She disappeared on the third day of the round up and as certain as I've become in these four years that she's alive I still haven't gotten over the first moments of dismay The round-up had been stopped and I was walking home I became uneasy at the door It used to be locked - Rosa! - We're here sir. - The others? - I've no idea sir. When I got back with the dinner-pail I found the ladies gone. I found the ladies gone. Mrs. Buky too. - The trunks? At the station? - No. Here then?! I couldn't make out what the disappearance of the luggage meant. My son found in the basement flat was talking about some lorry. What lorry? I had fetched you your dinner, sir. Stay here with the kids! I anticipated the worst. But the disappearance of the trunks could have eased my mind. No one rounded up was allowed to take luggage. Only if the Germans took them away. I couldn't ponder things then I was possessed with fear. Rosa! I know a Rosa here. This way! To the school! Rather, to the beach! Rosa! The holes? - Want to see? - Leave her! Haven't you seen my wife? - It's not a place for ladies! - Time? Fourteen. She'll be found. Hey, you! Take that corpse! - Into the water? - No, to the inn! Two German platoons came here and left. Perhaps they took them away. They often take hostages. Beg to introduce myself. Captain Buky. Go and find your wife! Rosa! Haven't you seen my wife? I searched everywhere during those three days, all in vain. Evidently the Germans took them away Fell into captivity with the Germans. That's why she can't write. I was glad to be arrested. I couldn't find her for four years They'll find her now! I asked her to be called as witness No one takes any interest in a woman who's disappeared. But a witness is different! Lieutenant... any news about my wife? I've asked Nuremburg. No trace. There won't be any. The Germans hold back their witnesses. They're not in this case. Do you accuse them? A difficult position. I know they're not guilty. But they anticipated their being called to account. No other people with the same foresight as they had in Novi Sad. This is an officers' room! - I'm Corporal Szabo. - Well... what do you want? Beg to report, Sir: the bed! - I've been sent here. - We're officers. - I wasn't told so. - Now you have! Get out! Pound on the door! I'm not allowed to. I'm in the ranks. A field officer, shut up with one of the ranks! I protest! Lieutenant! Ensign! - Join me! - We must protest. It's a bit odd. Odd? Did you say odd? Outrageous! - You weren't at the Academy? - No. Why are you here? Speak up. Speak. It gives me a chill. We got orders not to speak. - The General told us. - Which General? - Feketehalmy-Czeidnere. - That order is invalid Novi-Sad? The charge? I don't know, sir. I was patrolling... the whole three days. Did you murder? Murder? To you, to me. - Strict order. - Not everyone was a murderer. Stop it! Change the subject. If my leave expires three days later I'm out of it! I can't blame the Colonel who made me station commander. - But bad luck! - He couldn't see what was going to come. I'm like any other man who got orders. Still I'm treated as if I were different. All men are the same. Only there are lucky ones who get off cheap. Not better people, but luckier. I always detested Grassy. Grasch! He forbade families to stay with the officers. His smallest mischief! I never criticized orders but that one made me crazy! When the comb-out started I reported ill. To teach him a lesson. I didn't turn out. Only when I was appointed to command the remaining troops. The guard was lining up when I entered the barracks. Major! - Well? - Two letters were lost. Haven't you seen them? - What letters? - My wife's. Two are missing. Allow me. to look for them in your belongings. - Are you mad? - Let me do it or I'll call the guard! Don't overstep the line! Lieutenant! I was there when he saw his wife for the last time. My wife is... As I learned later the major had only run into Grassy. Maybe that was why he couldn't say goodbye to her. She was a tall, proud woman so different from the crowd that I knew it was her. I sent two river guards to accompany her home. She didn't board the train. Their son who was wearing a feathered cap didn't disappear. A feathered cap? - A feathered cap? - It was the fashion in those days. Tall, proud woman? To my memory My wife? Do you know anything about her? I didn't know her. I couldn't have known! Of course not. While in town she never left our home. If Grassy had got wind she was there I would have been punished. All this because of Grassy's unnatural order! I was writing her daily. My wife became jealous. And between us not without reason. I knew there was something wrong About my landlord's origins. I got good board and felt as if I were among Hungarians. I wrote to my wife the woman didn't look Jewish. She replied mockingly By defending a Jewish woman I'd shown I'd liked her. I was defending my landlady until some interest awakened in me. I found less and less reason for my wife's anti-Semitism. My landlord was often away. We were alone. The woman didn't resist nor was she quite yielding. No word passed between us about it. My love for my wife was never affected. Once away from your wife you get sensitive to feminine charms. I'd never had a blonde lover before. They left me cold But now I came across Betty. I hated the barracks. I had ten roommates there. She was a professional Betty will solve my lodgings problem. Put the money on the table. I may not wake up so early. Did you regret you took out so much? On the contrary. Too little. - What a nice lady! - My wife. Put it back! - Her season ticket. - It's got to be renewed. - I've been transferred here. - Permanently? Then you'll come again? I had such success with her that she wouldn't take any money from me. I wish I'd never left her bed for three days! But I had to go to the station Now we've come to the point! Grassy thought we were going to lead monks' lives! Meanwhile he changed his lovers but recommended the officers "the greatest circumspection!" I can't blame my wife for joining me! She might come in. Believe me. No reason for jealousy! She doesn't look like a Jewess! You defended her till it raised my suspicions. These are not the sort of people you thought them to be. I didn't say a word. She isn't your type. My wife comes from a Catholic family. She was taught by the nuns to hate the Jews for Christ's suffering and wounds. She could reconcile it with "love your neighbor" because she just avoided Jews rather than hurting them. In a few days she suppressed her aversion and made friends with Edit. Edit was so prudent that Rosa's suspicions turned in another direction. Their friendship made things easier on me. I never loved Rosa so much. Perhaps because I felt guilty. Don't take that for hypocrisy! I just wanted to live down my guilt someday. Edit's presence was a reminder too. We were like a honeymoon couple. Let's see! How much have you grown? You're still shorter! Jealousy made her blind. She began to keep an eye on Milena. A pretty woman living with her child in the basement flat. She was helping Edit with the housework. Her husband was drafted into the Yugoslav army. I did nothing to calm Rosa's suspicions. While the cold was freezing us he was mucking about with women! We were patrolling the whole day. Always on the edge of the pavement We were told we might be attacked. But we found nothing suspicious. What corps were you with? Beg to report, with corps 16. - Patrolling? - Almost three days. - Any casualties? - None. Or one. Corporal Dorner, on the third day. - Were you in his squad? - Yes, sir. I hadn't then been to the non-com school yet. - On the third - Cursed be the day! - Go on! - I'm fed up with Novi Sad! - At the trial you'll be interrogated enough! - All the more! We have to prepare our defense! You had one man lost. Grassy anticipated bitter fighting with heavy losses! - You had no gun-battles? - No. Whenever we could we went into houses to get warm. The first evening Corporal Dorner's friend took us into a school-room. Prisoners were held there. They were scared to see us. But we didn't touch them. It wasn't all that peaceful! The reprisals were justified! We were briefed. Christmas was the day appointed for bumping off all the Hungarians. The Serbs printed leaflets about it! - Did you see one? - Not myself. But I could believe it! It wasn't that peaceful! I was walking towards the station. It was given in orders that we should fire at the first movement. The privates shot like mad. They didn't have to make an account of the cartridges in those three days. She was only a railway clerk. The doc couldn't do much to help. She had it, the clerk! She was shot by Dorner's men. Don't say that! To make us responsible! The Corporal would never have done such a thing! What's that? In your hand!? Leave the Dorner squad alone! They served the country! Where did he get brandy? I got it. So what? From one of the guards. Now that you've drunk it keep the rest to yourself! Of course I will. I served in the Dorner squad! In the dishonored squad! The Dorner squad. Stinking peasant. An insolent one! Don't insult the squad! It wasn't us that shot the clerk! None can say we did it. It wasn't them. And even if they'd done it we can't blame them. But the confusion, panic Bad luck And me, perhaps. For my inability. Me and my men had no practice in making identity checks. We'll be late for school! It didn't enrage the crowd. It rather calmed them down. I had to start checking. I couldn't tell if it was compulsory for people to carry identity papers I had to decide. Bosun! Those who have papers stand on the right. There was no significance to this right and left. Still I felt like the master of fate But I had no idea what to do I have to escort any suspect elements to the school. School? What for? To teach them to read and write? Let me do the picking! Go on. I was glad to get rid of the task. But I felt uneasy. as the scarfed women were herded away. I went away. Commander! Where are they being taken to? - I know many of them. - Another train! Well, if you know them come and help! - Know her - Right! - Know her. - Right. - Don't know him - Left! - Know him. - Right. Don't know him. - Left. - Know him. - Right. - Don't know him. - Left. - I can't bear it - Well, go on! - I can't be the people's judge! - Nonsense! You're helping us. Permit me to send away the Palanka train! Well alright. Those from Palanka board the train! Get in, quick! What's all this? Don't interfere in my business! Damn you! Yes, sir! Let me go home. My husband is a war cripple. I have to give him lunch. The guards took my gesture for permission. In the street no one was safe. The patrols were scared by not having met the enemy. No wonder the clerk fell victim just like the Regent's godson. What have you done? You brutes! I know her! Don't stand gaping! Into the house! Careful! Put her down! It's you, you God's punishment I ought to have known all of them The trains continued to arrive If there had been no trains there would have been no checking and I wouldn't have been here! But I couldn't stop the trains Not your fault! If there was a cordon why did they let in the trains? A nonsense, militarily! Grassy's idiocy! He ordered a curfew. People crossed the fences. And why? Milena brought the news that listening to the radio was forbidden too. I could hardly quiet them But I was on duty I had to go. I saw no reason for alarm Partisans have been spotted. Killed four frontier guards. They've infiltrated Novi Sad. A comb-out's going on. There'll be firing? And then, if they hit innocent people? As if she had anything to fear! The placards were posted too late. The Hungarians got confused too. But they remained unharmed, I hope. Women can sense danger. She felt the third day in her nerves Then she disappeared On Friday Betty, too, had premonitions She cropped up - Why? - She fled to me of all people It's dangerous in the town. I'm scared. This note was left on the bed-table I'll have you escorted home. Let my friends also come with me! Alright. Go ahead. She had more courage, Betty, than most of us! The gentlemen from the town were still coming to fetch their acquaintances. I was sorry there weren't more of the courageous or corrupt people. How did they know there was danger? It was no secret what was going on in the area. The news of the mop-up reached me too. But those were in villages! I couldn't leave the garrison headquarters. I heard the rumors, but I didn't care. Now I often recall Nagy's words. they seemed so irrelevant then. They're just waiting to pit the Serbs against us. There'll be other victims too. They'll call it "excess, accidents. " It's in the Germans' interest that blood should be shed! Imagine, if the Serbs reoccupy these parts! We simply couldn't imagine it. We were confident in our victory. Who calls the victors to account? That's why I didn't understand the General's briefing. His pugnacity. The results of the first day are deplorable! Those who feel weak go to the hospital! All my thoughts were with my dependents I demand sternness! That's all! I felt like running home No one else moved. I spent the whole evening with my family. A pig was killed that day. I only learned the next day an officers' meeting was held around midnight A dog's lying outside. Shot by soldiers. Such incidents shouldn't happen! Tomorrow I'll forbid shooting in our street! You'd better not go in tomorrow. Are you so afraid? Of what? Of a comb-out party. Don't let them in! It would be safer for the kids where no bullets can find them. Take them with you to your place! - My Angelica'd be delighted! - Blast him! When others were shivering and hungry even his batman lived in clover. That beggar of a yokel! By the evening the officers, too, were in a nervous mood. I let the manager's sister go home from the station and got a hotel room. I was seated among high ranking officers. 400 have been caught. 200 will be executed. Sent by me You're an optimist! I know Grassy. He's a madman! Thousands'll be put under the ice! I'm sorry. Identity check. I'm Colonel Ballay. Holder of the Iron Crown. How do you do? Ask my husband! Scandalous! She has no papers on her. My wife shouldn't be molested! The officers are staying here without their families. Colonel Grassy's order. The town is full of spies. I must see her card. Madam, I beg your pardon. OK? What was it for? Tell me - Can't you start a train to Pest? - I can't. And to one of the nearby stations? He wanted to get out of town My only advice was not to risk his life! He seemed to like danger He somehow managed to get to Pest He wasn't so lucky in 1944. He was caught and executed with other patriots. He spoke openly with me this free speech was his downfall. He'd come in nicely as a witness for me since he entrusted me with the command of the station. He stood by me at the officers' meeting. Grassy's words were flying over our heads like so many blood stained swords The enemy has taken refuge here pushing their faked papers under the noses of our Gendarmes! The "Among Us Method!" What's that? All suspects are shot and the 40 "partisans" must be "among them. " More sternness! A real fighting spirit! My aim is: the complete annihilation of the enemy! We must show that we won't tolerate insolence! We must show that there's no mercy when it comes to retribution! What are we going to do? Nothing! We learned that we only fire if we see the enemy. Stick to that! I also said: "Don't accept idiotic orders!" "Only if written!" I said too much. It wasn't like that! That officers' meeting! There we learned the real importance of the events. I ask you to inspect the wounded gendarmes. Bring them! And we tolerate our sons' blood to be shed! We must show that Hungarians won't tolerate insolence! We are patient. Patience is one of our virtues! But it doesn't last forever! My aim is: retaliation! The annihilation of the enemy! Report! We caught some Jews giving light signals from the synagogue's tower. Jews are chetniks! That sounded strange. But then we got it. The Jews spoke Hungarian out of self-interest! They're more culpable than the Serbs! Those were never anything but Serbs eating Hungarian bread. But if a Jew commits treason?! Every officer knew that blood had to flow! Avenge our men! Rousing words "My aim is: retaliation!" Unforgettable. If Corporal Dorner had known that he wouldn't have gotten cold feet! Open up! Open up! What's going on here? You, Bolshevik! Hide away when the enemy is making mischief? - We've been on duty for weeks - Patrol duty! Retaliate resistance! Repeat it! Look alive! That night I got six toes frozen. They hurt like hell when the weather is changing. The Corporal swore for us too. He was as tired as we were. He had guts! For all the faults he had. Look alive, blast you! Dirty night job! Damn it! Pick it up, stinking peasant! So you do it! Hold this! Did you... did you just it me? Damn you! You'll pay for that! Take it over. My gun! Your pistol! Why must we carry this perishing thing? The pistol! Alright - To your place! - He tore off my button Squad... March! We were walking on... Looking for traces... A place to stop and warm ourselves up. Hey! Open up! Why's that light on? I've been washing. Have some! Drink! Brandy! Ask next door. Her arms were bare Her breasts stirred But they weren't so firm They looked soft That was her luck! Let us in! Bakija! We have no drinks. Who has? I have some stew. And some tea. Robbers! Help! Robbers! Where's brandy! Gottlieb always has some. A. GOTTLIEB. ELECTRICIAN. Two of you stay behind. Yours. How dare you?! How dare you?! I'm a taxpaying citizen! I'll report your tomorrow! This is robbery! Quiet! Let's go I want a needle. Let's go! It might be here. Leave it alone! Let's go! When Dorner got sober he took us back to the place There were gendarmes. Halt! Not a word about last night! Is that all? Two isn't enough? The electrician wasn't to be found. But he appeared in the schoolyard. Murderers! Killed my family! Don't call me names! Corporal! - He's after you. - Murderer! You killed my family! Corporal! Come here! We were expecting to be scolded. But they liked Dorner's report. Got friendly. As a reward escort them to the river! The other prisoners had to carry that electrician. - You're lying! - I'm not. When I was interrogated I kept silent. - But now as we - Shut up! - You told me to speak! - Shut up! We'll be held responsible! For these brutes! He came to see me that morning. I interrogated him as every complainant and furthered the minutes. Were they Hungarians? No, sir. Persons wearing Hungarian uniforms. Impudence! As if it had been addressed to me! I didn't think fit to ask Grassy about it. It might have put me in an awkward position though I wanted to clarify my wife's matter. So I kept silent. I decided to keep silent. He must have sensed my disagreement If you want to report me here's the telephone! This is the only line connected with Pest. The regulations guarantee you the right to do so! Want to be left alone? That irony paralyzed me. I forgot about my rights. All I saw was Grassy's face. I couldn't bring up my wife's matter. It would undermine the morale of the ranks if we were to scold them now that they've begun to taste fighting! The Germans have beaten Europe and you go wailing over a few Jews?! I didn't beg him. I only asked: - May I go? - Yes! "Regulations guarantee you the right!" Easier said than done! Some said Grassy killed someone who called the reprisals a massacre saying that we were taking orders from the Germans. I didn't believe that. But the danger of speaking your mind was not lessened! It's easy to be wise now! Not about those three days! Those who took part in things they'd never have done willingly were ashamed the next day to go out in uniform including myself. We leave the rest to you. Dispose of them. The chaos was growing. The gendarmes couldn't cope with taking the suspects away. They set up a makeshift prison. The prisoners knew old songs I got a slip with the words "I also know a few nice songs. " "Zsarko, in the cellar. " A daredevil! Can it be sad? Stop! How could you dare write to me? We saw you. Have me locked up here. On your authority. Don't let me be taken away! Save me! From the Gendarmes. I'm on their list. What have you done? What you would have done too. Three days. Half of it is still to come. I have to survive it! Giving himself up to me he got me into an awkward situation. Instead of the cellar I had him taken to the waiting room. He was taken away the next day If he were alive he'd be a witness for me. He was to become the leader of the local resistance. What resistance, I don't know. We were kept in the dark. It wasn't us that decided. But we have to shoulder the responsibility now! They're different... The Germans. They keep back their witnesses who will prove German innocence! That Grassy fled to the Germans from the sentence compromised them enough! Their precaution seems the more justified now. The Germans have always done a job for it! I was lucky. I was supplying tea By then the number of victims were several hundred. But I had nothing to do with that. I didn't touch anybody. I was making sure my rum wasn't stolen. Plenty of rum, in the tea. Meeting gendarmes we didn't stop. I showed by this: "Soldier's one thing, Gendarme's another. " I liked Colonel Grassy. He might have made mistakes but he was a gentleman to me. To a simple ensign. Our men left these people behind. All the non-coms have a scent for is Jews! To the others! Take this rabble! Have their identities checked! - The lorry is yours? - It is, sir. We're taking tea. Are they getting rum? Yes, sir, plenty. You could lend a hand to speed up the work. This scum must be dumped into the Danube! There weren't many colonels that would speak to an ensign! Go on! I had no idea then where we'd be going. To the beach! I wish I'd jumped out. Let's go! Couldn't we wait a bit? We can't. I didn't want to know anything about this. I'd had enough of it What could I have done? Dumped water in the petrol? The petrol tanks were guarded. They'd have shot me! The town was teeming with chetniks. against orders? Men are like beasts. They go where they hear the cracking of the whip. Am I worse than a dog? Why do they keep hiding things from me? We're among ourselves here. Or aren't we? We took our group not to the beach But to the river bank. The beach was already full of them. Have a try! Wait here. Not much of a job. You'll help. It's deep enough. We'd need a plank. But we'll do without it. I saw some planks at the tavern. Two hand grenades! Come on! - A proper place. - How large? As would take five grenades. A tested method. That'll do. Run! Well done. Rum. For the cold. Bren gunner! Come here! It needs widening a bit. Scoop it out! Lay them down! Bring them along. Three at a time. Stop it. See what's up! My gun! I was ordered to go when there was most to see! The first man was just pushed into the ice hole as I go to make order a woman kneels down before me Offering me her son. Of about seven. "What for?" I said, though he had a fur coat on. I was turning round to watch the scene but she grasped me. Enough! How did I fall in among murderers? How did I fall in among murderers? No difference among us! Therefore we are put in one cell! Who killed that electrician? You! By not sending him to the hospital! My wife never knelt down to you! She'll be summoned! My son is alive, too! All I said was a woman with a boy of... - Liar! - Shut up! Don't you see? I lived to see those things I wish I hadn't! I did everything I could within my powers. I couldn't expect the Germans coming! Operator? Give me 115. The civilian lines can be switched. I couldn't set out in the dark. Discipline was loose those nights. I had to wait till dawn. I kept to the middle of the road. Ready for any attack. It's me. I wanted to be on hand when the patrol came. We were so anxious. Next door a patrol had come to check and arrested an old man. He spoke Hungarian though! Bring the bag. You'll leave. Go and pack. It's too much for us. Help her! Are you packing, too? I'd go mad without Rosa. Still I feel so mean before her Any relations in Pest? Ask her first. - Are you coming too? - I have to stay. Dress the child, please. I've invited my friend. No objections? Of course not. With her daughter. They're scared. It was a mistake to argue with the engine drivers. I ought to have yelled and acted. I didn't realize it then. We were so dismayed. - Don't leave us! - You stay here. Don't go! The commandant? Make way! Make way! What are you doing here? A personal affair, sir. Follow me! My only thought was not to give away my wife. Suddenly I felt sure he knew my wife was in town and he wanted to show me. Beg to report. You're sending too many people to us. Attended the meeting? Stop sending all this rabble to HQ. We're busy enough. Permit me to stop trains before the station. The trains must arrive. No alarm should spread from here. - Not sending trains is alarm enough! - Send them! - Passengers have been executed. - It's absurd, It's absurd, your kind of language! I want you to dispose of your civilians alone! I request the right to decide on identity checking. Dispose of them! And what about the suspect elements, sir? Don't send anybody in. They're full of faked papers. You've no means of ascertaining them. But there are other ways! I haven't been briefed on that. You are to dispose of those arriving by train! This is no check, this is a retaliation! Am I to check people or have them sent to HQ? No other way? - I can't see one. - You're discharged! Finished! My wife is... Follow me! Get in! The drive was so ominous through the streets that I didn't realize I hadn't said goodbye to my wife. Grassy dismissed me without a word. I didn't know whether it meant forgiveness or the end of my career. I almost wept with shame. Half an hour later my batman eased me. I've escorted the ladies and taken the trunks back to the house. - Good. - Your lunch, sir. Follow me. I demand admission! - It's vital! - I've got orders, Sir. Hundreds of lives depend on it! - This round up must stop. - Higher orders! The good news calmed my anxieties. I'm an officer's wife. Know her? The name. Not the lady. Stay here. The others will come with us. What can I take with me? Food for one day. We told you to stay! Get in, quick! I want to clear them! Take me to my husband! He's a captain! Get going! I learned there it was impossible to continue the method of the previous days. Very good, I thought. But I didn't express it. Kaszoni was already taking action. He popped up unexpectedly. He seemed to be furious. Cease fire! Cease fire! We shouldn't leave those! You go and report! - I'm Corporal Dorner, sir. - Cease fire! Escort them back! These people have seen everything. Let's finish off with them before lunch! Yet he figured on a decoration That very morning he told me: If I ever get a grand silver, it'll be now. I'll get it for sure. To my dying day I'll remember that I was whistling as I reached our door. No! I stopped whistling when I saw the door was flung open. Rosa! We're here sir. - The others? - No idea, sir. I anticipated the worst. I had to absolve my batman. He had brought my lunch. I nearly lost heart... But I found a hopeful sign, the disappearance of the trunks The indictment says there were soldiers who looted. I wouldn't believe any Hungarians did so! I ran to the beach hoping to find Rosa. But no one could remember her. Two German platoons came here and left. Perhaps they took her away as a hostage. Nobody knew anything about her. Everybody said it was likely that she had been taken away by the Germans. I made inquiries with the Germans. They didn't want to hear about it. Reasons of diplomacy. They need witnesses to exonerate themselves There really appeared a few Germans on the second day. They didn't go into the streets rather they helped out indoors. Using gestural language. But the detainees understood it. They had to take witnesses to prove later that they had nothing to do with the atrocities. They'll turn up from some camp. Those two, I mean three. Maybe from a French camp It depends on where they were when the war ended. The Germans got some order on the third day. They scampered off like rabbits. - The cowards! - No one asked you! I admit German commerce stripped us bare. But not the Army! Comradeship in arms is sacred! See? Well I see. Are they still giving themselves airs? Are they thinking that I'm the only criminal? For doing the dirty job? I was there on the ice. But I didn't touch the living! When the first shot was fired I was sent for a carriage pole. They shoved the spies in head first. But the water would push them back up bottom first. So we needed the pole badly. All the chetniks claimed to be Hungarians arrested by mistake. "I was an officer," But he had no papers. Three women were wailing: Our husbands are officers! One was tall, the other roundish The third had the look of a rabbit They listed the names of all officers. That made them more suspicious. Suddenly I saw staff taking the tall woman to the empty inn. She kept imploring Staff said: We'll see afterwards! Half an hour later I saw the woman being kicked by staff: "Admit that you're a Serbian slut!" "You'll pay for this," she said. She'd have stood at the end of the line but joined the other two. I had to go back with the pole to make room at the hole. It wasn't a job for one. We did it the two of us. Ten minutes later came those three women. They were clinging to each other... Sobbing Had fine underwear and lovely round buttons especially the I knew it was his wife. But that idiot couldn't heed. Now he's dead. Better to hold one's tongue! How strange! At naval college you studied ice-blasting as the most peaceful subject matter. To prevent floods, to catch fish you could blow holes with some TNT. Well... Here's the result! How could they identify the corpses? 3,309 Under the ice. What became of them? 299 crippled with age It's absurd! They have to prove it! Subtitles: freakout; corvusalbus; IRregula
