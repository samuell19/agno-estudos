[upbeat music] [motors revving] - And Les Cooper picks up another lap. This man is driving a fantastic race. If Cooper can hold his pace, he's set. He's got this afternoon's exciting race in his pocket. Yes sir folks, it looks like Cooper is finally going to break that heavy load of bad luck targeting him on the Southern 500 three years ago. [engines revving] Hold on folks, that's Eric Lang at number 41 making his bid and he's really highballing. Old Mitch is going to get a run for it. There goes Terry, going to pass on the high side. And it's Cooper, face him into it. [tires screeching] [car thudding] That was Tara Lang at number 41, out of the race thanks to Mitch Cooper, the man who know all the tricks and doesn't hesitate to use 'em. Wait a minute, looks like someones in trouble. It's Cooper in number eight, and he's blown a tire. He's in real trouble. [tires screeching] [car thudding] [sirens blaring] [jazz music] [engine starting] - Hi there, got some troubles? - Yeah sorta, where will I find Ben Williams? - Well I'm afraid you won't. Old Ben died about three years back. - Oh, I'm real sorry to hear that. - Yeah, I took over the place. Can I help you though? - Well you know, I used to work right here for old Ben, helped him out. As a matter of fact, you might say that I lived right here. Looks like Ben expanded the place quite a bit. - No, I did most of that. Hey, what can I do for you? - Oh nothing much I guess. - Well wait a minute, what'd you come out here for? - Well I told you, to see Ben Williams. - Well why, what about? - Oh I don't know, a man gets a little broke, his stomach gets a little empty, gets a little lonesome, so comes crawling home. Well I, I was born back up there in those hills. As a matter of fact, I built my first car right here out of old junk heaps that Ben used to buy up for salvage. Boy that first car really can scorch. - Yeah I bet, well listen I-- - You know I had a real ball driving these hills. As a matter of fact, that's where I learned how to race. I was running moonshine from the revenuers. [laughs] Yeah, I had a ball, a real ball. Well boy, I'll be seeing you. - Hey what a minute, that's yours? - Yeah, what's left of it. - [Les] How many horses? - 230. - [Les] Mitch Cooper, didn't I read you got clobbered in some race? - Yeah, both of us. - Wow, what a mess. Honey, come here for a minute will you. My wife. Meet Mitch Cooper, he won the Southern 500 three years ago, right? - Right. - So. - So he's used to pushing round some of the hottest iron in auto racing. I've watched you win quite a few races Mr. Cooper. - Well this is one you didn't see me win. [iron knocking] - Well, I guess you can't win 'em all. Where are you heading? - Well that's a good question. I was gonna come down here and get a job with old Ben till my leg got well enough to drive again. - So you're broke too? - [Mitch] That's right lady, don't I look it. - Yeah, you look it. - Say, I could use some help around the garage. Why don't you give me a hand? I can afford it, now the way things are going. Maybe in our spare time we can even fix up your wreck. [Mitch laughing] I got every tool you ever heard of. You can even stay with us for a while if you want to. - Where will we put him? - Well, what about that storeroom in the garage? Put a cot in there. How 'bout it Mr. Cooper? - Best offer I've had today. - My name's Les York, this is my wife Rene. I'll tell you what, why don't you two get acquainted. I promised this guy I'd have his car ready by five o'clock. Then we can all sit down and have some dinner, huh. - Sure Les. - You know this is a nice little place. Ben used to make a good living here. - We do too, Mr. Cooper. [dramatic music] - Why don't you just call me Mitch. - Because somehow, I just don't think we're going to get to know each other that well. - Well if it's gonna 'cause any trouble. - It won't. If you need more hangers. - Thanks, mighty fine meal tonight. - Glad you liked it. - First home cooking I've had in a long time. I wouldn't want 'em to get cold, we better tuck 'em in good for tonight. - Good night Mr. Cooper. - Like I said, just call me Mitch. - Good night. - [Mitch] Same to you. [water splashing] - Hey Mitch, hand me that 5/8 socket will you? Thank you. [water splashing] What do you figure on doing with your car, now that we almost got it ready? - Sell it. - [Les] What made you decide that? - Well I'm gonna have my leg in a cast for a while yet, and a racing car is no good without a driver. - You know I could drive it for you. [Mitch laughing] I've dona a lot of hot rodding, drag strip stuff. I was pretty good too. - Yeah. - Listen Mitch, I know what makes an engine tick. I can tear 'em down and put 'em together blindfolded. - Yeah, but that doesn't make a driver. A lot of drivers can't even change a tire. - Yeah, I guess that's true. We could go partners, split everything 50/50, right down the line. - Look forget it. You got a good business here, you're making money, you got a pretty wife, forget it. - Oh that's something else. Mitch, I always wanted to try my hand at auto racing. You could be my chance. - Look, I said forget it. - Well just tell me, why not? - All right, I'll tell you why. 10,000 guys. - Oh I know, sure. - Wanna be drivers see, and maybe one, just one's gonna make it. You don't just get into a car and start driving. You're either born with it or you're not. Or maybe you don't know what I mean. - Yeah, I know what you mean, and I think I've got it, otherwise-- - Otherwise you'll spend the rest of your life winding up in seventh place. You got to have ability, natural ability. - Well how do you know I haven't got it. - You think you've got it? - Yeah, I think I've got it. - All right, we'll just see if you got it. We gotta check that car out anyhow. - Good, it's almost ready. I'll pick up the clutch this afternoon, put it in tonight. - Well, just don't make all the noise in the world, I gotta get my beauty rest. - Yeah, you sure do Mitch. - Hey you know, a little of that fresh mountain air might not hurt either one of us. [laughs] [dramatic music] Now coming out of the straight away on a track, you hit the turn high and on the outside, and don't drift. If you drift on a turn with all that traffic behind you, you'll wind up in somebody's lap. So you say to yourself, in slow and out fast. - In slow and out fast. - Yeah, you've picked your groove and you stay with it. Let's go for a ride. What about your safety belt? [upbeat music] [tires screeching] [engine revving] Keep your hands opposite each other on that wheel. - Sounds pretty good. We're only turning 3,600. - We'll see how it handles coming off the turns. Just over that hill. - Sure feels good Mitch. - In slow, out fast. - Okay. - Pretty good boy. Watch it! All right, get back in your groove. You drive a race with both feet. By the time you get your left foot on the brake with a pile-up in front, it's too late, somebody gets hurt. To say nothing, a totaling of my car. Say, you're all right. - We got company. - Revenuers. - Mind if I keep ahead of 'em? - Think you can? - I can sure try. - Let's go. [tires squealing] Come on boy, stomp on it. They're closing the gap. Nice stop. - [Roy] Get out. - Well any trouble sir? - [Roy] Mitch Cooper. - Hiya Roy. - [Roy] I've been looking for you for a long time. Search the car, I mean search it. - Wait a minute, what for? I'm just taking a ride with my friend. I was teaching him how to drive. - [Roy] Get out, both of you. - All right, you say so Roy. I don't know what you expect to find though. - Hmm, what happened? - Oh, I mashed my ankle real bad. - Sorry, so sorry. Search the four floorboards. - [Deputy] Yes sir. - No man has ever caused me more sleepless nights than you have Cooper. - Well why, 'cause I used to like to drive around these mountains late at night? - You know what I mean. - He's clean sir. - [Roy] Can't be, search for dummy gas tanks. - [Deputy] Okay. - Hey, you know Les, Roy here woulda made a good driver on the circuit. How come you never turned your talents to race driving. - Keep talking big boy, you'll get used to the sound of your own voice when they turn the key on you. - [Deputy] Not a thing. - [Roy] Can't be, no dummy gas tanks, no false floor boards, nothing? - Not a thing. - Hey, just a minute. You didn't stop me 'cause you thought I was running shine did you? - Aww get out of here, both of you. - Now wait a minute Roy, you know I wouldn't break the law. - I'll get you yet, get out. [dramatic music] [engine rumbling] - Hi honey. - [Rene] You're late. - And what are you doing up? - Worrying about you. - A big boy like me? - I went to the bank today Les, and money has been going out. - I, I meant to tell you 'bout that honey. - Make it good Les. - Well I, sort of loaned the money to Mitch. - That was charitable of you. - Well you don't understand honey. He needed it to buy new parts for the car. - And what are we, the finance company? - Rene honey, I don't know what you got against this guy. He doesn't mean any harm, he's working very hard. In fact, he's the one doing me the favor. He's teaching me how to drive. What I'm trying to say is honey, I'm racing Mitch's car. We're gonna split the purse. - And what about the coffin when you go and get yourself killed? Is Mitch gonna split the purse on that too? - [Les] Aww come on honey. [dramatic music] Don't you know you're married to one of the indestructible iron men? Besides, I love you too much to go out and get myself killed. [engine rumbling] - Start working on that timing Eddie. Hey Mitch! - Hi Buddy boy! - [Buddy] Hiya Mitch. - Hiya. - Good to see you. [laughs] Hey, how's the leg? - Well it's okay. You still making music for Reichert? - Oh sure, you know coffee and cake money. - You never drank coffee in your life. - Not so loud. [men laughing] Well, it's good to see you back in business again. But you're not gonna drive with that ankle are you? - No Les is. Oh, Les York, Buddy Schaeffer. - Hello. - Nice to meet you Buddy. Sorry, I ... - It's all right, I've been flying a long time with one wing. [men laughing] Well let's see how she checks out. Number eight, you're not still driving with that number. - Well why not? - Why not, the man wants to know. [laughs] Les, it's what we call an upside down number. It reads the same both ways. That's the kind of number I was driving with when I got this, number 66, quite a race. Well you remember Mitch. - Yeah. - Was out of Daytona, there I was having myself a ball. Way out in the front and only two laps from home. Well all of a sudden this lightheaded character running the group decides to pit. Saws me off and with the door closed, I got nowhere to go. Well you remember Mitch. - Yeah. - And I wanna tell you, right then and there, I started the biggest collection of iron, this side of a war surplus junkyard. Man those cars were all over the place, and did those goats kick, and me right under one of them. [man laughing] Oh, it was quite a site, wasn't it Mitch? - Yeah. - Les, you won't believe this, when that crash wagon got out there, they had to use a torch to cut me out. And that guy must've been real nervous, 'cause the flame took all the whiskers off my face. [Mitch laughing] Saved me a shave though, and was I ever lucky. That night I had a date with a real honey bun. Aww yes, quite a race to remember. Huh Mitch? - Yeah. - I'll tell you one thing Les, you got a man with you. Good luck. - Thanks Buddy. - Well you two, I better be getting back before Reichert starts blowing his motors. [Mitch laughing] Oh, one thing, you better shock her down stiff on this track. - Okay Buddy. - See you two. - He's quite a boy. - Who's Reichert? - He's a big man, industrialist. His hobby's racing. He buys cars, drivers, crews, anything, anybody, that'll help him win a trophy. I think he'd rather win a trophy than be on a deserted island with a beautiful woman. - To each his own. I think I'd take the island. - Yeah, me too. [metal clanking] Let's see if you can give him a run for that trophy, huh? - What do you mean run? I'm taking that trophy home to Rene. - You stay between the fences. - [Announcer] This boy Les York is driving a beautiful race his first time out, and little wonder. With Mitch Cooper, the man behind the man behind the wheel. York is green, but he's not a back off guy. He's goes in and out of a corner just like the master Mitch Cooper. He's in trouble! No, no, no, he's coming out of it! Hold it, hold it, well how do you like that? Came right out of that spin and he's still going. Well that cost him five positions, but he's fighting his way right back up there. Believe me, you're going to hear lots more about Les York. This boy's got lead in his foot and brains in his head. [engines revving] - Rene, Rene honey, I came in third. I almost won second, but-- - Congratulations. - Smell it, 160 bucks. Of course I know it hasn't got the rich, ripe, full smell of green that first place has, but you'll smell that too some day. - Meaning what? [dramatic music] - [Les] Meaning, I'm going to quit the garage. From now on I'm racing, full-time. - Is this your idea or Mitch Cooper's? - Honey, I'm going to be big. I know I can. I know from the way I drove today. Well Mitch says I've got it. - Les, this isn't the way we planned it. And I don't like it. - Can't you see honey, this is my big chance. I don't wanna be a grease monkey for the rest of my life. That's not for me and I don't want it. [dramatic music] - You don't want it, well maybe you wanna end up like Mitch Cooper! [rain falling] - Why did you do it to him? You didn't have to let him. - Look, why all me? Les' idea. - You could make him give it up. - Give it up, he's just starting. And he's plenty good at it too. You know somebody gets into something like that, they just don't give it up. Les is a big boy and he's old enough to get a license. - You know what I mean. It's your car. - [Mitch] Yeah, well he's my partner, I can't stop him. - Then I'll play it this way. I don't want us going broke, crawling from track to track, living out of a back end of a station wagon. Not knowing from one day to the next whether or not my husband's gonna be driven off to the hospital or to a cemetery. - Well, maybe it won't happen to Les. - What do you want to happen to him? - Look lady, drivers are born, not made and Les has got it. - All right, I'll put it to you different. I had to scrounge for everything I ever got. - Well who didn't? - I got my education slinging hash at a diner where truckers drove through. I had to listen to all the small talk, sweet talk, bed talk. Then Les came along, and he made me feel like I was something special. And I fell in love with him, I married him. And I still love him Mr. Cooper. And I'd go back to slinging hash if I thought it would help him. I'd listen to the same small talk, sweet talk, bed talk, only this time it'll be different because I was married to Les. And I wanna stay married and have a live, whole husband. - You know everybody has to have something. With Les it's racing, and he's got it. Right in the palm of his hand. See some things get in a man's blood. Like a woman. - Or poison. All right, so it's no go, only I'll tell you something mister. I'm going to go along with Les, I'm gonna follow him from track to track, and I'm gonna make sure that poison doesn't kill him, like maybe it's killed you. [upbeat music] [upbeat triumphant music] - Well, I got Joe to fix that the other day Palmer. Got my fuel pressure up now, it'll hold five pounds. - [Palmer] Yeah, good. - Oh hello Weatherly. - Hello Mitch. - How you doing? - Hey, you taught your boy how to drive, how is he? - Well he's pretty good. - You gone give us a run this race Les. - Well I don't plan on towing your friend my slipstream. - Hey listen to this guy, thinks he's gone win the race. - That's right. - We'll see. - Good to see you. - See you boys. - Oh, you're beginning to talk like a big man Les. Hope you don't get too big for your helmet. - You just keep the iron hot, I'll do the driving. Come on, let's unhook. - Look Higgins, I said close the hood, I mean it. Get the car ready for the track. - Come on, knock it off Tommy. You couldn't drive a kiddie care in your condition. Go on home. - You go to hell. - Come on boys. - [Tommy] You just try and stop me. - Tommy. [Tommy yelling] Drop it Tommy. Tommy, go on back to the hotel. Have Myrtle fix you some black coffee, get some sleep, huh. Shorty, drive him over to the motel will you. Go on Tommy. - What happened to his face? - Ran off a racetrack once, had a little fire. - Hey, I didn't mean to chew back at you. - Well I did. - Hey Mitch. - [Mitch] Hi Joe. - There was a girl around a while ago, seemed powerful anxious to see you. - Well I'm powerful anxious to see her too, thanks Joe. Say, would you mind looking after the store, I got a little unfinished business to tend to. - You'll have to bear with us, but it'll be a little while before your room is made up Mrs. York. People just vacated, but if there's anything I can get you in the mean time. - No thanks, I'll just sit and wait. - Hi, my name's Kay Hill. - Hello, I'm Rene York. - I know these all night rides to a race track. Why don't you wait in my place, a nice cool shower. - Oh heavens. - Come on, it's this way. - Kay, have you seen Tommy? - Oh no, I haven't Myrtle. - Well he's been gone all night. And he hasn't been off that bottle, I'm so sick inside I could die. - Now stop you're worrying, Tommy can take care of himself all right. He always does. - There he is. Tommy. - You get used to it after a while. - Do you? Is your husband a driver too? - Oh no, no husband. Married to a car instead. I own it, if they ever change the rules about women driving, I'll probably get behind the wheel myself. Well here we are, make yourself at home. - Thanks. - Your husband drives Mitch Cooper's car doesn't he? - Yes, he and Les rebuilt it, he's been living with us. - Kind of fun to have around the house isn't he? I mean, you find him easy to get along with. - How do you happen to know him? - He used to drive for me. A woman, a race, Mitch took 'em as they came. - Meaning what? - Meaning nothing. Meaning maybe I hope you're in love with your husband. - I'm in love with him, but thanks for the warning and the advice. - Just thought I'd pass the word. Only don't ever let Mitch nick your skin. He's got a way of getting under it, and it isn't easy getting him out. [jazz music] [door knocking] - Anybody home? Well, hello. Aren't you in the wrong place? - No, but you are. - I mean, how did you get here? - I was invited. - Now don't go believing all those stories that Kay told you about me. - Outside mister. - Look, I just came in here to see an old friend, I didn't know you were here. - Are you gonna go or do I have to yell? - Hey you know, you look cute in that thing. I like it even better than that car coat. - I guess I yell. - [Mitch] I didn't know you were here, honest. [jazz music] - Please. - [Mitch] Yeah, maybe I'd better go. - Thanks. - [Announcer] There's number 25, just in time for the checkered flag. Ladies and gentlemen listen to this. The average speed ladies and gentlemen for the four laps is 121.438 miles per hour to establish a new record here at the Southern 500. - Well, he's a boy to beat. Looks like Reichert bought himself a bargain this time. Little Junior's gonna have a good position when the starter drops the flag. He's all foot and no brains. Might make a good driver some day, if he lives. - Maybe, but that's still not winning the race. All right you guys lock it up, I'm going out there. - Not yet. - Huh? - See those clouds up there? - [Les] Yeah. - [Mitch] Well in a couple of hours this track's gonna cool off, smooth your carburetion out, might pick up an extra mile an hour. So we'll wait till the last minute. Let them burn their tires up on the track. [skin smacking] We'll stick better. [engine rumbling] - [Mr. Reichert] Nice driving Thorsen. - Thank you Mr. Reichert. - Take the car over to the inspection area kid, I'll make the arrangements. - [Mr. Reichert] How'd the tires hold up boys? [engine revving] - Hey, you know that Reichert doesn't seem like such a bad guy. - He's not such a bad guy. All depends on what price tag you put on your soul. - Now, what'd you do that for? - Don't you ever let me catch you eating those things around here again. - But Mr. Cooper, what'd I do wrong? - Look Stoogie, you just done eat peanuts in the pits. - But I like peanuts Mr. Cooper. I always eat 'em, ever since I was a kid. - The next time I catch you eating those things around here, I'll ram 'em down your throat. Peanut shells and all. Now don't you forget it. - Hey Stoogie. - Mr. Schaeffer. [Buddy laughing] What's wrong with eating peanuts? - Well nothing, in a circus or in a saloon. Once upon a time there was a stoogie who worked at the tracks. He used to eat peanuts, he used to love peanuts more than, well he used to eat 'em by the bag full. He had 'em for breakfast, he had 'em for lunch, he had 'em for dinner. And one race there was an eight car pile-up, and four of the drivers got bent up all the way. And you know what they found? In four of the cars there were peanut shells. And you know what else? From that race on, peanuts has been the kiss of death. You understand? - Ladies and gentlemen, the next driver out for his qualifying runs this afternoon, from Kokomo, Indiana, driving the 1957 Ford number 91, Tommy Webb. - Say Tommy, when you want the flag? One lap? Say, are you okay? [engine revving] - [Announcer] He leaves the starting line in a veritable storm of dust and piles the automobile into the first turn. - It's a milk run, he's only going around the tracks Myrt alone. He's got it all to himself. - Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Tommy Webb, who's driving this 57 Ford, number 91, is one of the real old pros in this stock car racing business. Always a tough competitor, always a driver and a car to watch. Keep your eyes on him here today during these qualifying runs and on race day, watch that car, number 91, driven by the old pro Tommy Webb. Tommy Webb bows that automobile up the fourth turn, down the straight away, this time for green starter's flag. And he's on the official qualifying run. He moves into the first turn, high up against the guardrail. Handled very nicely indeed as he goes down on the first and second turn. Really battling, rolling that automobile now. [car crashing] [flames roaring] Send the ambulance in, the fire truck, everyone stay off the track please. - Tom! [dramatic music] Tom! Tom! [sirens blaring] - I wanna go now. - Not yet. - What do you mean not yet, now. Don't you understand? - Okay kid. - Your attention in the pit area please. Cotton Owens, you have a long distance phone call at the booth to the rear of the pagona. And now ladies and gentlemen, the next driver out for his time trial here today, is the young driver Les York, driving the Mitch Cooper car, number eight, the 1957 Chevrolet. This young driver has won so many dirt track races this year, that Mitch Cooper, the old pro, feels that he is now ready for the big one. He's out on the starting line now, ready to start his official time trial. [engine running] Another new record. York just bit up Thorsen's mark, set not 30 minutes ago at that first lap at 40.09 seconds. And he's still on it. That second lap is faster yet. 44.07 seconds and that's 121.622 miles per hour. Hang on ladies and gentlemen, it's a fast one. Les York in car number eight, he enters the port turn. [engine rumbling] Uh-oh ladies and gentlemen, something's wrong. The motor's cutting out, he's drifting into the port turn slowly. Now heading into his pit area, and Mitch Cooper has walked out on the apron to the track, awaiting the arrival of the car to determine what happened. - What happened? - Ah the motor quit, all the guts went out of it. - Take it easy kid, we'll fix it. [audience rumbling] [upbeat music] - Why I remember when everyone was pig happy. All them hot shots wanted to hose big irons with lots of horses under the hood. I told 'em they was all clear crazy. You remember Buck. - I sure do Buddy. [men laughing] - So Mitch Cooper comes along and bets me a century, that he'd have 20 laps on me at the finish to the 500. Well I just loved that. So you know what I did? - Tell us, Buddy honey. You already will anyway. - Thank you Peaches. [laughs] Well I went out and I bought one of them real 66's on the market, the slowest dog I could find to run against them big dogs, and away we went. - Tell us what happened then, buddy honey. You already will anyway. - I was hoping you'd ask. Well I pulled in second place and had all 35 of them tired dogs behind me. - Why Buddy honey, you're just marvelous. [Buddy laughing] - You're leaving out the best part. You forgot to tell 'em, when they pulled that motor for inspection, all the cylinders were bored out so big you could stick your head in each one of them. [everyone laughing] - Aww, come on now Mitch. You know I'd never spoil a good story for the sake of a little truth. Honey, would you mind filling my radiator? [water splashing] [upbeat music] - Hey, how 'bout a hand? Hello. - Hi. - I'm Eve, I hope your name is Adam, and I'll let you fix me a drink. - The bars over there. - Who is that? - Her name's Eve Mason. Three years ago her husband spun out and died. She's been trying to forget every since. - Well she doesn't have to forget with my husband. - It's not just Les honey, it's any man, any husband. - But I'm not just any wife. Les never drank whiskey straight. - Want me to talk to him? - You're the one who said it Mitch, he's a big boy, he can take care of himself. [Les coughing] - Let me help you catch your breath. How 'bout another? - Kiss? - Drink silly. - Well, like you said, he's a big boy. [chuckles] It's his hangover. ♪ I'm going away ♪ Soon to stay a little while ♪ But I'm coming back ♪ If I go 10,000 miles ♪ Look away ♪ Look away ♪ Look away ♪ Over Yandro ♪ Who will tie your shoes ♪ Who will glove your hands ♪ And who will kiss ♪ Your ruby lips ♪ When I am gone ♪ Look away ♪ Look away ♪ Look away over Yandro ♪ Oh he's gone ♪ He's gone away ♪ Sure to stay on for a little while ♪ ♪ But he's coming back ♪ If he goes 10,000 miles ♪ Look away ♪ Look away ♪ Look away ♪ Over Yandro [audience clapping] - Come on. - Rene honey, where you been? Rene I want you to meet Evie. Evie this is Rene and meet Mitch Cooper, he's the greatest guy. - We've, we've met. - You need a license for hunting darling. - It's a big jungle dear. They roam around wild. What do you expect? - Mines fairly tamed. And if I ever told you how I tamed him, you'd turn yours in for a new model. - I think it would be sweet Les dear if you fix me another drink. - Go ahead fix it, and fix one for yourself, for the road! [upbeat music] - A cup of coffee? - No thanks, I'll smoke this one out. - You get Les to bed all right? - [Rene] Yes. - Not a bad party huh? - Wonderful, wasn't it? - All right, so Les got a little drunk. - Sure, and little Eve had it all set up to be dollar day, like Les is a big bargain on sale. Everything but the fig leaf. - Don't be bitter. A lot of people have something they get lonesome for in this world. - Is that a personal observation? - Well, I've had my share of things to be lonesome for. - Like what? - Well racing's all I know. I like the smell, the speed, the noise, I don't know. - What about the funerals? - Well I didn't expect you to understand. - Mr. Cooper, I don't. - Well it's kind of hard to explain. It gets in your blood, the money and glory. I like all of 'em. - The women? - Well there's only one kind I never had. That was a woman like you. Someone to follow me around, be with me. Be for me, Les is lucky. Well, good night. - Take her around for a few laps kid, profile those tires. Start practicing pulling those inspection doors, just to check. - I'll win this race, even on rims. - Well you just keep practicing on those inspection doors and checking those tires, you'll come across that finish line in a hearse. [engine rumbling] - Did you ever hear that drinking and driving don't mix. [men laughing] - Hey Mitch, can I see you a minute? - Sure, you go on, take your head with you. [laughs] - Say I was wondering, could I float a small loan? - What's the matter, doesn't Reichert pay y'all? - Well sure, but somehow it just seems to melt away. - Yeah, like ice in a glass. - Oh, I'll pay you back, you know I always keep a record. - Yeah I know. - Thanks Mitch, the pens inside there. - Okay. - Hey you know you, you kind of sorta changed. Now it could be my imagination, maybe I'm wrong, but well it's just striking me that as I remember, there was only one thing that ever kept you moving around one place for any length of time. Of course some times it was two women, but. [laughs] - You know, you got a real smart way with engines Buddy boy. Why don't you stick to them. [engines rumbling] - Hello York, you're pretty good. - [Les] Yeah, not today I'm not. - I've been watching you. Anytime you wanna drive for me. - Then what Reichert? Live, breathe, and die of a Reichert, to bring the trophy home. - I'm a liberal man Cooper. - Yeah I know you are. You tried to be liberal with me once. You can put up the money all right, but you take away the man. Why don't you try using robots for drivers? [men laughing] - I'm giving a little party, you might call it a pre-celebration for my team and cars winning. I just stopped over to invite you two. Hope you could come. - [Les] Thanks Mr. Reichert. - [Mitch] Yeah, thanks. - So I still say, what's wrong with Reichert. His money talks big, pays his drivers top salary, even lets them keep the purse, all of it. - You know Les, I think you're counting dollar signs instead of sheep when you go to bed nights. [engine rumbling] - Thorsten, you're fired. - But Mr. Reichert I couldn't help it, the engine just blew. - And your brains are lead too. You made yourself a good starting position, so now you burn the car out, just at its peak. Now I've got to start over again with a new engine. - [Junior] Please Mr. Reichert, let me drive the race. If I win, don't pay me, keep the purse. - You're fired. - Still think Reichert's a great white father? - Hey, a new motor costs 1500 bucks you know. - That's like a 10 cents to a guy like Reichert. He's got a dozen motors in that van over there, all set up. See the kid hurt Reichert's pride, that's worse than blowing 10 motors. - You know Mitch, the more you talk, the more you're beginning to sound like you're turning into a do-gooder. - Thanks for the ride. - Maybe I'll see you later. - Yeah, maybe. Hi, honey. - Hi. - Oh boy that cold shower is gonna feel good. - How'd it go today? - Okay, I must be getting pretty good. One of the big boys offered me a job today. - Driving? - Of course. - Why don't you take me some place tonight? We could go to a movie, or just take a nice long walk. - Well, we are going some place tonight all right. Mr. Reichert, the guy that offered me the job today, well he's giving a pre-race party and he asked me to come. Did you get my slacks back from the cleaners honey? - Yes, Les I don't wanna go to that party. Just a lot of strange people I don't know and you'll just sit around and talk about racing. Can't we just spend the evening together tonight, alone? There's a good movie. Or we could just sit around here and watch TV. - Honey, well you don't understand. Mr. Reichert's an awful big guy in auto racing. And if he invites you to go some place, well you just can't ignore him. - Are you going to quit Mitch and drive for him? - No, of course not. But when Mitch's ankle's all healed, well, I might wanna drive for Reichert. - But that's some other time. And I'm here now, tonight. And I wanna be with you, alone. - Look, suppose I just go for a little while, just long enough to say hello, and then I'll come right back home. - I suppose Eve's going to be there too. - Well how do I know? I didn't see any list of invitations. Aww come on honey, get yourself all prettied up and we'll have a good time. - I'm sure you will. You'll have a good time, but it won't be with me. - Why don't you lay off? I told you this was business and I've gotta go. - Well go ahead and go and have yourself a real ball, because I'm going to that party too, but it won't be with you. - Well that's fine, that's just fine. [upbeat music] [party goers chattering] - You know, we're very much alike, you and me. I mean I. - How's that? - Oh, you don't have any home to go home to when you wanna go home and I don't have any home-- - Why all this talk about going home, we're at a swell party, plenty of booze, and you look very pretty tonight. - You don't understand, nobody understands. Bartender. - Now just slow down, you won't last the night. Let's walk around for a little while, come on. - It cost about $10,000 to put one of those cars on the track Les, and I got five of 'em. Just in case one of 'em isn't running exactly right. - That's a lot of loot. - My boy qualified for a front position before he blew up that motor. You could drive for me if you want to Les. You'd be so hot, they'd choke on the smell of your rubber. Well I'm afraid I can't Mr. Reichert. You see, Mitch and I, well-- - I know, loyalty. I admire a man who's loyal, but I also admire a man who knows what's best for himself. - That's my department, isn't it honey? Excuse us. - Excuse me Mr. Reichert. Sweeten this, will you please- - You do like me, don't you? - And I like you too honey. Bartender, bourbon and water please. Now, who's going to have him like whom? You did say this was a big jungle, didn't you honey? You might not be able to tell it my by sweet gentle looks, but I'm a real cat when it comes to my tiger. And I have news for you honey, I don't share him with anybody, including you. - Why you! - Why don't you go change your makeup Eve, go on. [jazz music] - Take me back Les. - What'd you have to do that for? - Why don't you take her home Les. - I don't need you to tell me what to do. I'll go if I want to or I'll stay. - Then stay! Take me back Mitch. - Sure honey. - One big happy family. - Not if he lets Mitch Cooper play big brother to his wife. Your wife does a pretty good job once she gets started. - [Les] Well that wasn't like her at all. She's not used to drinking. - Did you two have a family quarrel or something, I noticed she came here with Mitch. - It wasn't much, some things she just doesn't understand, that's all. - Well, maybe Mitch will get everything straightened out. He's got an understanding nature. Look honey, your wife's had quite a few drinks, and I don't think Uncle Mitch was the ideal escort home, you know what I mean. - Yeah, thanks. Wait a minute. You two make a real handsome couple, don't you? - What do you mean by that? - We go partners, 50/50, well that didn't include my wife. - [Rene] Les, you're all wrong? - Am I, stay out of this. From now on you better stay outta my life and hers. - Look, I don't know what you're thinking. - I'll tell you what I'm thinking, I'm thinking you and I are through. As of tomorrow I'm driving for Reichert. - Well, what about the race? What about my car? - You can take the race and your car and go to hell. Or drive it yourself if you've got enough guts. Come on, you. - Hi Mitch, any chance you might be looking for a ride home? Well, yes as a matter of fact I am looking for a ride home. Good to see you Kay. [engine rumbling] [motor knocking] - [Buddy] I'll be back in a few minutes. - Where you going? - Cooper's got trouble and I think I know how to fix it. He never was any good at fixing them cars, but he sure knows how to drive 'em. - Well you're working for me, not Cooper. - The boy's in trouble, he's gotta qualify this afternoon, it'll only take a few minutes. - Well I'm not paying you to work on cars that are racing against me. If he can't fix it, that's his tough luck. - Well Mr. Reichert, you can't expect me to stand around when a guy's in trouble. - Well don't just stand around, get busy on my car, or get fired. - Thanks Mr. Reichert, for helping me make up my mind. I'll see you around the pits. - What's wrong with the car Mr. Cooper? - I don't know. - You got a spot on your crew for a one-armed tool slinger? - Well don't stand there staring sad eyed, you heard it misting. If you're gonna do something about it, get going. [Buddy laughing] [engines rumbling] - That was Mitch Cooper in car number eight, finishing his qualifying run. But it looks like Cooper will have to be content with a field position in this Southern 500 this year. And ladies and gentlemen, that's concludes our time trials for this 10th annual Southern 500. Attention in the pit area please, will you drivers and pit crews drive your cars down to the inspection areas, so that they may be impounded until race morning. [engine rumbling] - Did you lose something Mr. Cooper? - You never drive a track boy, without walking it. Smelling out every inch, checking the weak spots. - But you know this track like your own skin Mr. Cooper. - Tracks change boy, just like people. Don't you ever forget that. Hey Les. Keep it between the fences kid. [upbeat music] [audience cheering] [horn honking] [sirens blaring] - Dear God, a great event is about to take place here today. There will be danger here today oh Lord, and we who sit and watch these young men act out this great clean sport, pray that you will watch over them and protect them. And although there will be 50 of these young men waging a fearsome battle across the vast stage, there can only be one winner. But we do pray, dear God, that you will grant each loser his life, that he may try again for victory some other day, amen. ♪ Amen - Attention all race car drivers, gentlemen go to your cars please. Attention all race car drivers, go to your cars please. Gentlemen, start your engines. [engines rumbling] Let's all stand up ladies and gentlemen and cheer them on their way, this is the base lap. Curtis Turner driving the beautiful old space car, winner of the Southern 500 here in 1956. And Rebel 300, winner of 1958 has his passenger, Bob Collins, president of the Darlington Raceway, and the beautiful Ms. Carolyn Melton, this years Ms. Southern 500. 50 of the nation's top drivers make up the field here today and 50 of the nation's fastest cars, painted in all the colors of the rainbow. Past Southern 500 winner, Bob Roberts, Buck Baker, Speedy Thompson, and Mitch Cooper are matched against a field on entries that include new comers Bob Curtis, Johnny Olive, Buddy Baker, Les York, and the father and son team, three time Grand National Champion, Lee Petty and his son Richard. [engines rumbling] 17 Chevys, 16 Fords, eight T-birds, three Pontiacs, three Panhards, two Oldsmobile, and one Buick make up this starting field here today. And they're both going towards the starting line and the green flag that will get this Southern 500 under way. [gun firing] [engines rumbling] Well, the fastest starting in Darlington history. And off the second turn, down the back stretch, it's Bob Robinson in Pontiac number three. Speedy Thompson in Impala number 22. Elmo Langdon in Buick number 10. Rex White in Impala number four, and Bob Bucker in T-bird number 73. [engines rumbling] [tires screeching] There goes Les York in the Olds number 25 moving out between the first and second turn to contend for a front spot. Watch that car number eight, driven by the old veteran Mitch Cooper, he's making his bid early in this race to place his car in contention. [engines rumbling] - You two check his rubber when he comes in. Stoogie, you get his windshield. Too fast, too quick. You two get his gas, I'll get the hood. [tires screeching] [car thudding] [dramatic music] [engines rumbling] - Mitch Cooper is driving a magnificent race so far. Consistently moving up through that traffic. At lap 50, it's Les York in the lead in the '59 Olds number 25. In second place is Joe Eubanks in '58 Ford number 82. [tires screeching] Cooper running flat out, past his time on Carson on the inside. Cooper now running in fourth spot. He's very much in contention, keep your eyes on that number eight automobile. - Little boys don't drive Darlington kid, there goes a man, give him a position. - It's Les York still out front, but all these boys had better watch out for Mitch Cooper. It's the old master out to get the pupil that he taught to rise. And the pressure is beginning to worry York. [light knocking] - Come in. - Oh sorry ma'am. - It's all right, go ahead. [jazz music] - You must have a man at the race? - Yes. - Yeah, I been cleaning these rooms a long time. You'll get to know. [engines rumbling] - [Reichert] Ask him if he needs anything. - He's still good for 20 laps. - And listen to this, the track temperature at this time is a blistering 132 degrees. Those tires are taking a terrific beating on this track today and so are the drivers. For your information ladies and gentlemen, those race cars aren't air conditioned. Cooper makes his bid, look at that number eight go. He gets around Langford and Eubanks to bid the number two spot. Man, this is going to be a race. There's some gloomy looking faces in the Reichert pit along about now, and the pressure mounts. [men laughing] - How 'bout that Stoogie? [tires screeching] - At 230 laps, it's Les York in number 25 at first place. Mitch Cooper in number eight second. Joe Eubanks in number 82 third, Shep Langdon in 64 fourth, and Joe Weatherly in number 12, fifth. And the old pro, Mitch Cooper, is now riding in York's slipstream, way to get York's rear bumper by forcing him into these turns. I'll bet that's a little trick that Mitch didn't teach York. And there goes Mitch Cooper around York on the low side. Well how about that? Cooper feigned York over to the left and pulled up on the high side. They'll now running side by side, bumper to bumper, and wheel to wheel as they charge off the fourth turn and down the straight away. Cooper puts his foot all the way in the carburetor on his automobile, pulls by York and grabs the lead. Wow, what a battle. [jazz music] - Please call me a cab right away, thanks. - What's wrong Mr. Schaeffer? We got the lead. - I never saw Mitch drive like that, he's cutting out too quick. Bring him in Stoogie, it's time for gas anyway. - Now it looks like it's a battle between Cooper and York. Right down to the finish line. - [Mitch] Come on gas it up, I'm in a hurry! - You're not going any place Mitch, you've had it - Come on, hurry it up. - You've got a cracked brake driver, it won't last till the end of the race. - Come on, come on, get that tire back on. - Mitch, you can't drive! - I'm going to finish this race. - In a coffin you do. - Put the hood down. Put the damn hood down. - There goes Mitch Cooper, out of the pits and back into the race. Seem to be some trouble down in the pits that time between Mitch Cooper and his crew chief, Buddy Schaeffer. It's all straightened out now though and Mitch Cooper is back on the track running. - What's wrong with the car Mr. Schaeffer? - Tired iron kid, tired iron. - That pot stop cost Cooper some laps, but he's pushing that number eight now to make up some lost time. Bobby Johns, the young man in the entry is still running strong in car 72, as is Richard Petty in car number 43. And Joe Weatherly, the boy who always brings this huge crowd to their feet is still very much in contention. [engines rumbling] Uh-oh, it looks as if York is getting ready to pit. [tires screeching] - [Reichert] You can take 'em. - [Les] I will. - That pit stop of York's now puts Cooper right back on even terms for the lead. Once again, it's the old pro bantering with the pupil he taught to drive. That pit stop of York's now puts Cooper right back on even terms for the lead. Once again, it's the old pro bantering with the pupil he taught to drive. [tires screeching] With only a few laps to go, it's Cooper and York side-by-side, bumper to bumper, and wheel to wheel, contending for first place. If they keep this up, they might finish in a dead heat. Boy, we've never seen anything like this. [car thudding] There may be a pile-up. [car thudding] [sirens blaring] The coaches signal on, the coaching car's on the track and the track is rapidly being cleared. The track is clear, the coaching lights turn to green. And they're ready to go again on the final two laps. - I had the machine and Les York was the man to do it. - This is what you wanted, so now you've got it. [upbeat music] - [Doctor] A pair of scissors please. - Hi. - Well hi, how'd he do? - He won. - Ouch, take it easy doc. - Everybody saw you do it Mitch, why? - Well, it was my pleasure. Oww, doc. [crowd cheering] You won, huh? - Yeah, I won Mitch. Thanks, thanks for a lot of things. - Forget it. - [Doctor] You folks mind leaving now? - Well, I guess I got everything. [dramatic music] Thanks. - Be seeing you Mitch, good luck. - You bet. Hey, maybe I'll see you up in Hillsboro next month. 150 laps, pretty big purse. - Well gee Mitch, I don't know. - You said I was married to one of those indestructible iron men. - Yeah, yeah, maybe you will. - [Mitch] I'll be seeing you. - So long iron man. Which way? - Oh it doesn't make much difference. [men laughing] [upbeat music]
