The Daiei Company Presents: Nemuri Kyoshiro: Shoubu (Nemuri Kyoshiro: The Duel) The Adventures of Nemuri Kyoshiro "Sword of Adventure" Based on the Novel by Shibata Renzaburo Fight Choreography: Miauchi Shouhei Asst. Director: Tomoeda Nengi Starring: Ichikawa Raizo as Nemuri Kyoshiro Fujimura Shiho Takada Mika Tamba Matasaburo Katou Shinjirou Asano Shinjirou Hamada Yuuya Ichikawa Kinya Hara Seishiro Directed by Kenji Misumi Need any help with the steps? Need any help with the steps? Need any help with the steps? Well, now... could you help me out? Sure, sir. - Hey old man! Looking good! - Go for it, boy! 'Scuse me! Excuse me! Would you let me through please?! Did you see that girl?! She was a pickpocket! Here you are, sir. Well... thank you. Well then... would you like some sweet treats? Sir, I'll accept money for pushing you, but nothing more than that. I see. In that case, here's 5 mon. Thank you, sir! An unusual young man... He's the son of a samurai... his father was a master of kendo as well. His father exhibited his talents at the Yuuhigaoka swordplay exhibition... ...and was even able to slice open kabuto armour. He was quite well known. A kabuto?! Oh yes, I've heard of him! He sliced a foreign-forged, iron kabuto... ...into scraps only 5 inches wide, and is said to be... ...the master of a dojo here in town. Yes, that's the man. Unfortunately he was challenged to a duel and slain. What?! He was killed?! The duel was held, he fell... and the dojo was claimed... ...by the rogue ronin who bested him. Is the boy living by himself? You saw how he supports himself, and he sleeps here in the teashop. He refuses to accept any help, and he pays for his room and board. I suppose he does so because he's the son of a samurai. It's touching to see such a young man make the best of his lot in life. - There you are ma'am. - Thank you for your help. Sir... if you want to give him money, why don't you do it directly? Did anyone drop this wallet? Anyone? Oh! Good boy! Here... That belongs to this man over here. Is that true, sir? That looks like mine. I thought I had been robbed by a pickpocket... Why didn't you say so sooner? I couldn't ignore this spectacular view of Mt. Fuji. Can you tell me how much money is inside? About 10 ryo in koban, and about 2 kotsubu. [Koban: A gold coin worth 1 ryo Kotsuba: A coin worth 1/4 ryo] In that case... Wait. I have to reward you. Do you... want to see the image of your father once again? Wh... I will let you, if you follow me. I will be heading over to the kid's dojo. Would you mind coming along and acting as a witness? "Nemuri Kyoshiro?" Name your style. - Ganshi-style. - What?! Based on the style of the previous master of this dojo... ...Goto Kyuuemon... whom you defeated... his Ganshi-style... I'll defeat you by slicing you from the shoulders down... ...exiting through your left side. How interesting. I will not spare your life. That is the reason I bought along a witness. Your New Year's fortune... Let me give you a reading... What's the matter?! I laughed because I was just imagining... ...how dirty the blood you'll soon be coughing out will be. Why you! Indeed, he's in pieces! Yeah! He did it! - Gentaro is you're name, isn't it? - Yes, sir. You just got your house back. The rest is up to you. Please teach me swordsmanship! Forget it. Swords are for killing. Nothing less, nothing more. Teach me! No! I have to fetch a constable, so you stay here. Don't you worry. I'll be coming back as well. Hey, you! Teach me swordsmanship! Sugoroku game pieces! Game pieces! Sugoroku game pieces! Doochuu-sugoroku game pieces! It's the doochuu-sugoroku game, folks! Howdy, sirs! Your first dream of the New Year could be about this! - Sold. - Thank you, sir! Just one is fine. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir! Game pieces! Game pieces! Miss, hot sake, please. - Want it? - No thank you. Your swordsmanship is too powerful. Killing a man at the start of the New Year might give you nightmares. Oh! If it ain't Shoroku of Takara-bune! Great to see you again this year! Denkichi! What happened to your usual partner? - He died, alas. - What?! He hung himself. Selling off his daughter must've been too much for him. Our taxes haven't gone down... ...even though we're having a bad harvest. Before you know it, the farmers are gonna start rioting! - Miss, one bottle of sake please! - Sure. What's bothering you, all of a sudden? Lately, there's been an increasing number of thieves and vagrants in Edo. They all come from the countyside. There's too much difference... between the poor and the rich. It isn't right. It isn't the way it ought to be. How about you? What are your thoughts about this problem? I think one old mans musings don't do anything for anybody. They only make the sake less enjoyable. Oh? Is that so? Is that what you think? Well, if you'll excuse me. Thank you for the treat. I see, I hope I didn't trouble you too much... ...I didn't even ask your name... but so be it. Once you leave, we'll be strangers. Farewell. - Here you go. Have another drink. - One bottle of sake please. You... You must've mistaken me for someone else! I know that you're Asahina Iori, the Finance Commissioner! - You dare to interfere?! - Wait! Wait! Who ordered you to do this? Tell me! Your New Year's Fortune... Let me give you a reading... I will not. I'll kill the old man no matter what. If you get in the way, I'll kill you as well. Hey... are you man enough to tell us your name? Akaza Gunbei. And you...? Nemuri Kyoshiro. You should've just minded your own business. Don't gather round here! Come on, go back inside! What a surprise for me to find out that you're the Finance Commissioner. Is this the first time you've been attacked? Well... What's the matter? ...it happened once before. What...? And yet you're walking around without an escort? They must have mistaken me for someone else. I don't recall making any enemies. Even if you don't remember, if somebody else does then what's the difference? - Does it hurt? - Thank you. Do you have any idea who might've sent that guy after you? None. I suppose it's because I'm not strong enough. Every day we get more and more ronin like that fellow. Once a samurai leaves his master... ...what's left for him but to be sword-happy. Poor souls. You have sympathy for the plight of someone who just tried to kill you? Old man, you're nuts! I wonder... if he came to kill me... ...or just to threaten me. There are many who aren't satisfied with the way I do my job. Perhaps nothing gets accomplished when an old man is in charge... ...but somebody has to do it. Hah! There's no difference between a fortune teller and a whore! I've got money! So serve me! Serve me! Then, you won't change your mind. That is correct. No matter how many times the request is made... ...I can't change something that's already been decided upon. But Princess Takahime is a daughter of Shogun Ienari. Ever since her 20,000 ryo allowance was eliminated... ...she has been most upset, sir. I am sorry, sir, but there is nothing that I can do about that. I see you're trying to avoid the problem, but... ...as part of the effort to cope with the Shogunate's... ...fiscal problems, you approached Elder Mizuno Tadanari... ...concerning the elimination of the allowances of royal daughters. I am aware that this decision was made at your suggestion, Sir Asahina. The House of Hori, of which the Princess is now a part, is most distressed. Do you have any intention of amending the policy. I've already answered that question. I see. I shall convey your answer to Princess Takahime. Before I go... May I say one more thing? Please. Sir, you have no wife, and no child... ...and I hear that you are a most learned man. Recently, you've submitted many proposals to the Elder... ...rules to restrict the movements of household guards... ...rules prohibiting overly conspicuous consumption by rich merchants... "Restrict this, prohibit that..." seems to be your attitude. But when you pay attention to the twigs, you cannot see the whole tree. I do hope that you are not digging your own grave, sir. That's what I wanted to say. Thank you for bearing with me. Oh? What happened to your wrist? I tripped while walking. It's just a scratch. Oh my, you must be more careful... Good thing it's just a scratch, sir. Please, you should take care of yourself. Farewell. You, stay back. - Yessir. - Yessir. Who was that? Shiratori Shuzen, a steward of Princess Takahime... ...of the House of Hori. Princess Takahime...? I hear that she's the most beautiful of all the daughters of the Shogun. You see... she married the Lord of Echigo Province, Lord Hori... ...but sadly, he passed away, and she's alone now. The rumours say that she's indulging in a most extravagant lifestyle. She must be a great burden to the Shogunate. Watch it! You shouldn't say things like that! By the way, did you report your problem to the City Constabulary? To do so would be an over-reaction to a trivial matter. So, what brings you here anyway? Did you know that a ronin named Akaza was following you around Edo? If anybody wants to take my life from me, it would be easy. I don't have many years left anyway. I'm only doing what I can. You're what's called a stubborn old fool. No, it's just that we're living in tough times... ...not to mention the bad harvests we've been experiencing. Doesn't that interest you at all?! It's boring. What I find interesting is you, old man. I don't want you to die. You're trying to protect me?! Th... That's totally unnecessary! You've got nothing to do with this! That's right. So I can do whatever I want. I... like you. Princess Takahime... when will I be able to become an officer? I am tired of living the life of a ronin. You're asking for too much. Just look at me... Since the day I was born, my life has been bound by strict rules. This tiny escape is my only joy. I pledge that I'll serve you well... Please make my wish come true. You'd prefer having a position to having me? That's not true! I do not want to be away from you for a moment! Excuses. I hear that your beauty beguiled your Lord... ...and his love for you inspired jealousy and resentment... ...resulting in an incident that caused your expulsion from your Clan. You've investigated my past? Given that I plucked you from the streets, my men felt it prudent. They told me that these fair hands belong to a master of the shuriken stars. You know such a thing as well...? How frightening! I've heard that the better a man's looks... ...the colder his heart. There you go teasing me again! Princess! Your proposals only make matters worse. The proposals that have been submitted to Elder Mizuno... ...are commendable on paper. But they are impossible to implement in real life! It could even be called a policy of buying popularity! Please, enough of this! In no way am I... ...just trying to improve the lives of the peasants. Then how do you explain your investigations of... ...the religious workers who are overseen by the Monastery Magistracy? That's out of your jurisdiction, is it not?! These jurisdictional conflicts are what I propose to completely eliminate! What?! If nothing is done, the current situation could lead to the fall of the Shogunate. Just how do you propose to deal with the recent corruption of samurai... ...or the economic crisis we are all experiencing?! Immediate, major corrective action must be taken at once... ...if we are to maintain the rule of the warrior-class as we know it. In any case, a discussion like this is meaningless! I want to hear what the Elder has to say! The Elder? Should the Elder opt to lend a deaf ear to my plea... ...then I will report to the shogun directly! To speak so rudely in our presence... It's intolerable! I understand all of your objections... I'll be rendering a decision after the first week of the New Year, but for today... ...I believe we shall adjourn. Elder Mizuno... the crop failures in the entire Kanto region are devastating. Unless we act at once... I'm already aware of the matter. But you know, "it" didn't sound too good. - Sir? - Ending Princess Takahime's allowance. No matter what, she is a daughter of His Highness, the Shogun. Asahina... it looks like this will be a very difficult problem for us. We must find a solution... No matter what... ...before the week of the New Year is over! My goodness. I don't know how to deal with the Finance Commissioner. He wanted to know the debts of all the Hatamoto... [Hatamoto: A samurai in the direct service of the shogunate] ...and he requested that I show him the account ledgers. In our case, he said we rice dealers would be punished if we... ...increased prices in response to the poor harvest. That's not all. When he makes impossible demands like... ...the nullification of all debts that are older than 5 years, then... ...I don't know why we brokers should even bother to lend! And that's why... And that's why, since Princess Takahime is the Shogun's daughter, she can... ...order me to go to His Highness, and demand Asahina's dismissal. Yes... You understand completely. Oguchiya... Izumiya... How does 20,000 ryo sound? Very good, sir. If we can take care of it for that amount... it's a bargain. You are indeed Edo's top money-lender and rice-wholesaler. You're in a class by yourself. I ought to have asked for more. Oh! Intruder! Intruder! After him! You again! Mind your own business! Don't you understand?! Don't follow me around! Right now, you're the one who's following me. I go where I want to go. This is a public road. Why you...! You're making a fool out of me! Nemuri Kyoshiro! You're going nowhere! You want to fight me?! I'm Sakakibara Kiheita; you killed my brother Saheita at the Azabu doji... - I've come to take my revenge! - Wait! Wait! The duel at the dojo was mutually agreed upon. It's dishonourable for you to hold a grudge against him! W... Wait! Hey! You two! Here comes the procession of Princess Takahime! You'd better not be caught fighting here! Dammit! If you move an inch, it'll be all over for both of us. - What happened?! What Happened?! - What happened?! Princess! An intruder! Someone's attacked the Princess! He must be hiding somewhere nearby! Shuzen... you claim to know the identity of the attacker? I'm not sure if he's just hired help, but... ...well there's a ronin who's hanging around Asahina these days. I believe that it was his doing. What? Asahina? On top of eliminating my stipend... ...he's hired some ruffian to come after me?! How dare he! Kill him! You want us to kill Asahina? Yes. You make it sound easy, but he's the Finance Commissioner. We must consider the risk that someone might discover who ordered the death. Are you saying that you can't do it? Not at all... If the right method can be found... Who's there?! Spectacular! I am Ebina Ryohan. Would you tell me what style you use? The Full Moon Cut Technique. We shall meet again. Wait! Are you after Asahina as well? No. You're the only one I'm after! Really? You'll be mine if I slay this guy you're talking about? Yes. You're sure about that? Yes. I fell in love with you the first time I saw you, on the street. I'll slay him no matter what. So, what's his name? Asahina Iori. Huh..? The Finance Commissioner? And, one other man... Nemuri Kyoshiro. Pardon me, sir... ...but based on a prophecy by Mioya in Saho, I must tell you something. Let me guess. You can see some bad omen in my face. Exactly. As the saying goes, "A swan stays white, bathed or not." You, a man of strong temper, have incised the omen onto your face. Get to the point. What is it that you want to tell me? Your sword has called out to five others. Would you like to go to where those five swords await you? What if I say yes? I shall guide you there. Oh? Where have you been all this time? The priest at Jokanji Temple wondered if you'd ever come back. I won't be going back there for a while. Then, you didn't come back for good? That's not the way it should be. What's the matter? Sir Kyoshiro... Your face... You've killed again? I'm on my way to be killed. No! No! Don't say things like that! - Really, I wonder where he's going...? - To a brothel, of course! Oh! How disgusting! Soba-noodles... Nabeyaki-Udon noodles... Oh, so the girl that you're in love with is Uneme... ...the fortune teller who gathered us here on behalf of Shiratori? Yeah. You accepted a life-or-death job just for a woman? Fool! What's wrong with killing for a woman? You're ill, aren't you? It's just a cold that doesn't go away. This Kyoshiro fellow... is he really that dangerous? I certainly believe so. That's why I can't allow him to live. I'll be the one to slay Kyoshiro. I won't let him live either. For my brother's sake... It's doubtful you'll succeed, given your performance the other day. You were watching?! No... we were just rudely interrupted, that's all. Are you mocking me?! Stop it! You've got a short temper, it seems. At any rate, our top priority is to kill Asahina. Not for me. Mine is Kyoshiro. - Mine too! - And Mine! Asahina's your top priority because you haven't met Kyoshiro yet. As soon as you lay eyes on him, you'll feel like you have to fight him. We'll be paid a lot for killing Asahina, isn't that right? That's what we agreed upon. Masuko, you want to become an officer, right? Well, wouldn't it be quicker just to sleep with her? You actor-like good looks are your sharpest weapon. - What did you say? - Stop this squabbling! Whatever our motives may be... ...we accepted the job because of our confidence in our skills correct? That should suffice. Exactly. But unless we can defeat our prey, our wishes remain unfulfilled. I encountered him first, so I have first dibs on killing him! Does anyone know about the Full Moon Cut Technique? It goes like this... He holds the sword downward and starts tracing a circle. And, before the circle is completed, the opponent is slain. I hear no one's ever survived the tracing of the circle. Then, when the circle is drawn halfway... ...when it's all the way at the top, his arms should obstruct his vision. That's right! That's the moment we'll have a chance! It'll be time soon. Will he come or not? He will! He's that kind of fellow. Why don't all five of us attack him at once? Right. Let's all attack him in the dark. That's cowardly! It shall be a man-to-man challenge. He who loses dies. Simple as that. Uneme?! What happened to Kyoshiro? He was with me 'till just a moment ago... but in the darkness... You lost him?! Maybe he got scared and ran away. - Here I am. Right here. - What? - Is that you, Kyoshiro?! - Come out, Kyoshiro! Say, Ebina... you're with these fellows too? You're not being fair! Where are you?! I haven't asked your style yet, have I? Upper-level "Shadow Mist" style. Come out and fight! I've come to talk. Hush and listen! You don't have any grudge against Commissioner Asahina, do you? What good can come out of killing an old man? - Forget about it. - Shut up! No need for questions! How dare you plot to take the life of an old man... ...just for your own selfish ends. Stop this nonsense! It's no use! We won't! Come out! I see. You're going to kill him anyway. In that case... I shall protect him from you. I'll kill... you first! Remember this about Asahina... That old man deserves to live much more than you do! Your New Year's Fortune... Let me give you a reading... Welcome back. Sir Nemuri... I knew that you were following me. This is my home away from home. Is Princess Takahime's steward, Shiratori Shuzen... ...the one from whom you're taking orders? It's no use hiding things from me. Why did you become his spy? Do you know what a woman's love is capable of? That's why I became Shiratori's spy. I have a husband... but, for certain reasons, he is imprisoned. I get it. Shitatori must've promised you that... ...your husband will be freed when you've killed Asahina. Yes, he said the promise has been endorsed by Princess Takahime. That made me sell my soul to the devil. Is that what being a woman is all about? You just don't understand. I'm sorry to say it, but your wish won't come true. I'm protecting Asahina. You're a master swordsman, one who should be feared. But I took this assignment knowing that very fact. You will see how determined I am to succeed. If we weren't enemies... If we were on the same side... Why don't you tell me about your husband. He is a foreigner. A foreigner..? A Christian? Yes. He was arrested for suspicion of... ...spreading the teachings of a prohibited religion. The woman that I am fell in love with a foreigner, but if she can't spend... ...her life with the man she loves, where can she find happiness? - What's his name? - Iruman Johannes Serdini. Johannes?! You know him?! It was at Christian Hill in Ohinata... Mon frere! Tell me why... ...you shouted something at me upon seeing my face? Your face... shows misfortune. A lonely, suffereing face. Not like other Japanese. You're the very person... who must be saved... ...placed in God's hands... That is the reason... I came... to Japan. On your feet! Unfortunate... suffering... face. I can see it too. Perhaps... you're the child of a mixed marriage? The colour of your hair... your looks... Stop! Never mind me. Why did you marry a foreigner? No, I shouldn't ask that. That's why I don't want to be questioned either. - So it's true... - I said stop it! The chilling look in your eyes... I know what you're hiding inside your heart is pure... ...but why do you wish to live a life of suffering and devastation? Do not speak of Jesus and his infinite forgiveness with your filthy mouth! You're the one who is arranging for some ronin to assassinate a man. And you seduced them into doing it! Listen... if you ever try to do anything to Asahina... I won't forgive you. How dare you... The poison in his tea worked, and his body is paralyzed. Good. Very well done. - Bring him inside. - Yessir. - Sir Shiratori... - You don't have to remind me. We'll arrange for your husband's release. - When? - Trust me. You'll be notified soon. Kyoshiro... are you still feeling numb? You've caused me difficulties. I won't let you live on. Now that you've lost, accept your defeat like a man should. I'm not particularly impressed with the way you treat guests. Oh. Well, at least your mouth is working. But Kyoshiro... ...even a master swordsman such as yourself can't escape those bonds. I can have my way with you. You may be a daughter of the Shogun... ...but I hear that your father Ienari has sired 50 bastards on his concubines. What's your number? - Insolence! - You're the insolent one. You're a girl who has exploited her lineage and... ...grew up doing and getting everything she desired. Just look at yourself in the mirror... you're uglier than a pig! You bastard! And now Princess Pig wants to grope this purer-than-snow body of mine... ...that's insolence on a grand scale! Matsuko! Are you jealous, pretty boy? You ruffian! Y..You! Don't move, or I'll twist her arm off. Princess! Princess! Princess! - Don't let him get away! After him! - Quick! Let us go to your chamber! I see. Thank you for protecting such an old man as myself. But, by protecting me, you've made enemies. I am worried. You don't need to worry about it. I'm doing this on my own. Just stay home and try not to go outside by yourself. See you... T... Tell me... where you live. What good is knowing the answer to that? It's just that I... That I've become interested in knowing who you are. I want to know how you manage to live. I don't have a permanent home. Yoshiwara one day, Yanagibashi another... If I get bored, I go visit a singing teacher I know. Would you knock it off and go home?! You're crazy! Jokanji Temple in Minowa is a long walk. I'll go wherever I want to. This is a public road, after all. I get a taste of my own medicine, eh? - Welcome. - Two bowls of noodles, please. Oh! - Make them hot alright? - Yes sir. Oh, just look at that, sir... I knew it was gonna be chilly... ...but it looks like the white stuff is already here. Is one of your homes, the Jokanji Temple, nearby? Uh-huh. Let's go through Nakanocho... You're going back to the temple? Thank goodness. - Why is that so good? - Because if you aren't around... ...I can't save up the money I get from delivering meals to you. A-ha! I see! Thank you for waiting. - Mister... - Sir...? How's business? Not very good. The cost of goods is up... and the price of rice has quadrupled... ...the poor folks can't make a living. I wonder... Exactly what is the Shogunate doing about it. Extra for you. Thank you. These soba-noodles of yours are pretty good. Of course! We take pride in our handmade soba! Hmm! Very good! Say, Tsuya... how does my face look today? Alright for today. Looks good. Really? On days when I've killed somebody, I can't come to see her... She'll hate me for sure. You can tell? Well, at such times he looks so frightful... so I can tell easily. It's as if she's a fortune-teller. Oh, how insulting, Sir Kyoshiro. No more discounts for you! Otsuya... stop being rude to our customers... ...why don't you go try boosting our business instead? Yes... business, business! Soba... Nabeyaki-udon... Oh... wait! You've nothing to do with this! This is something that I must take care of myself. Tsuya... keep your eyes closed. How mysterious... When the circle is drawn, the opponent is irresistibly compelled to attack. It is a frightening technique. I've come to take back the dishes. Thank you for the feast! I can't get miso-soup like that at my place! Thank you again. It's strange, sir... all you ever do is praise things! No, I'm only telling you the truth. This temple is called a "throw-in" temple. [Yoshiwara: A famous red-light district Yujo: A polite word for prostitute.] Yujo from the Yoshiwara who died of illness or suicide are buried here. "Throw-in...?" They don't get a formal funeral or tombstones. We just pay 200-mon to this temple... ...and throw the remains into a mass grave. How sad! My sister's buried that way. Underneath those Jizo statuette's over there... ...are the names of those who are buried. But one day, I'll save enough to build a real tomb. Your sister was a yujo? Uhh... I shouldn't have asked such a question. She sold her body to save our sick mother. But, our mother died... ...and then, when she fell in love, marriage was impossible... She left the world at such a young age? We all lead different lives, don't we. I have no wife or children. I wonder who'll visit my grave? Oh? You don't have anyone close to you? - No. - How pitiable. Everyone is pitiable. That samurai from last night was pitiable too. Why must there be such killing? Is it because you're a samurai? Whether you're a samurai or not, in life you either kill or be killed. I can't stand it! If everyone was like you, the world would be a lot different. You are such a fine and honest girl. You have the power to enlighten the hearts of others. No! There you go praising again! Oh? That's the first time... ...I've seen a peaceful smile cross your face since I've known you. You might be the only one who can cheer up Kyoshiro. Oh! Seems like that girl is in love with you. Even I can tell things like that. The pillow is to blame... [LEFT: "MEN" RIGHT: "WOMEN"] ...for disheveled hair... ...and then... Serves you right, Nemuri! You can't defend yourself when you're naked and unarmed, can you? Don't struggle! It'll just make things messier! Uneme... why did you hand me the sword from the other side? Why did you save me at the last minute... ...when you were the one who ordered that man to kill me? I'm not sure myself. Sir Nemuri... Uneme... ...have you forgotten your desire to save your husband? But, at the moment... ...yes, I was wishing your death... But, at that moment, somehow... I am frightened by my own feelings... I don't think Shiratori will leave you alone. What are you going to do... from now on? I shall leave Edo... and go into hiding somewhere. And devise another way to save your husband. Sir Kyoshiro... I shall never be able to see you ever again... Never, ever again... That damned Kyoshiro... I must have my revenge upon him, at once! Yes... We've devised a plan to destroy... ...both Kyoshiro and Asahina at the same time. How... How can such a thing be possible? I am saying this because it is possible. Asahina will be killed by Kyoshiro himself, right in front of you... ...and then, Kyoshiro will die while you look on. How interesting. If what you're saying is true... then I'll stake everything to see that sight. Tell me the details. First, we'll induce Yagyu Tajimanokami and Kyoshiro to fight an official duel... We'll especially prepare the swords they will use. The hilt of Kyoshiro's sword will be loosened. When he draws his sword the blade will fly off... ...and transfix an unwitting target, Commissioner Asahina. And, as for Yagyu's sword... ...it will slice right through Kyoshiro's body... splitting him in two. It's an order sent directly by the Shogun himself? That's right. He's been ill, and in the hopes that it will cheer him up... ...he wants to see a match at the House of Hori. It says that he specifically requests a duel between Yagyu Tajimanokami... ...and the swordsman Nemuri Kyoshiro. It orders me to escort you there. Something smells. I think so too. You should turn down the request. I can't do that. You'd be punished. If you disobey the Shogun's order, you could be removed from your post. It doesn't matter. Just forget the match. Even you won't be a match for the best of the Yagyu. This is a serious duel after all. You don't know that until the duel is over. You musn't! - I can do as I wish. - No, I won't let you! I can't... Old man, if this is a set-up, then the culprits are risking a lot. Our best hope of foiling them is to be bold. But if I refuse, you will be removed from office. Nemuri... you're so steadfast... If Yagyu Tajimanokami is my opponent, then the duel will be challenging. Rule: We are to cross swords at once at the assigned positions. Rule: No one is to be held liable for unexpected consequences. His Highness doesn't seem to be present yet. There must be a reason. Look at Sir Shiratori, he seems so relaxed. Sir Tajimanokami Toshimasa... of the House of Yagyu... ...and Sir Nemuri Kyoshiro... report to the arena. Remember, this is a one-time duel. That's all. Capture that ruffian! Desist! Desist! Desist! Desist, I said! The rule said nobody is to be held liable for mishaps! Desist! Go back! I said go back! Sir Yagyu... this was all a set-up. This sword was tampered with, so that the blade would detach. For what reason? To kill a certain individual seated directly ahead of me. This was no duel, but a plot to make a murder look accidental... ...and to ensure that there were many witnesses to swear so. Enough. You need not tell me any more. I wish the same. This matter never had anything to do with you. I admire the way you evaded my attack. You have a unique style as well. If fate permits it, I'd like to have another match with you. Take care of yourself. Sir Nemuri, I am truly sorry about the recent unpleasantness. I'd like to apologize to you and Sir Asahina for all the commotion. Please, if you would follow me to another room. Sir... Your superior has arrived! What?! Without prior notice? Correct, sir. He has already passed through the main gate. Sir! Hirayama, it's you... What's the matter? Elder Mizuno has arrived at the mansion. He has requested that you return at once. What? The Elder has come? Seems I have no choice. But perhaps, at least Sir Nemuri could stay here... "You're to move to Echigo, where you will remain..." My own father has thus sentenced me?! Princess... It's because His Highness is thinking about your future. No! I don't want to spend my youth in some rural exile! Tell my father that! The Elders have already been informed, and the decision has been published. Also, how do you explain the events of today? You did not ask for permission from His Highness. Enough. I understand. Ma'am... Well then, if you'll excuse me. Princess... there's still time before you leave Edo. I've been defeated... by Nemuri Kyoshiro. Princess... That man... stripped me of my pride. And yet, I feel like it's better this way. The first man to claim my heart... ...was in Edo all along. Yet, Edo is now so very far away from me. Sorry to keep you waiting. You feel better now that Ooguchi is dead. Why do you ask that, if I may ask? Because that's one less witness left alive. If you, the mastermind, and your conspirators... ...desist now, Sir Asahina may not investigate this matter further. I greatly appreciate your valuable advice. By the way, you said that you wanted to offer us an apology... I have a request. Oh? What is it that you seek? I'd like you to deliver to me the fortune-teller named Uneme of Saho. That's an easy request to fulfil. But she isn't here. I'll hand her over to you at an agreed-upon rendezvous. Fine. I have one more request. Tell me what you wish. Her Husband, Johannes... I believe that you have him imprisoned somewhere. I'd like you to hand this foreigner over to me. I hate to tell you this, but the missionary Johannes was... ...executed. - What?! What are you doing? You used Johannes like he's nothing! The girl betrayed us, so an eye for an eye, I say. That's how it is. So, I ask you that you tell the girl that Johannes was killed. Uneme doesn't know yet?! Correct. She has no idea. Only a day before the first week of the New Year is over. As you do your work, my best wishes will go with you. I can't thank you enough, sir. No, I haven't done anything. It was your tenacity that moved the heart of His Highness. Thank you, sir! Sir! How are things in Princess Takahime's mansion? Sir, I'm afraid to tell you that it didn't look very good. What about you-know-who... Kyoshiro?! Oh! Don't come closer! Don't come closer! Now, run! Oh... you're bleeding! Uneme, It's not safe for you to be here. Go! - Sir Kyoshiro! - Go! Fools! That won't work in the woods. Go attack him all at once! Yessir! - Wait, Akaza! Leave him to me! - No way! You aren't healthy enough! I know! That's why I want to face him! I've always wanted to challenge him, so even if I lose, I'll have no regrets! Then take this advice... Attack him just before he starts to trace the circle... That's the only chance you got! What's the matter?! Why aren't you tracing the circle with your sword?! Trace it! Slay me! Slay me! If you wanna die, do it yourself! Your Full Moon Cut Technique is a joke... Until your sword finishes the circle, I'm not attacking... You'll be defeated! Kyoshiro! Kyoshiro! Oh! You're all right! Thank you. Why don't you... use your talents... ...for the good of the nation? Help the Shogunate? No thanks. No, I'm just saying that you ought to live a stable life. Besides, you shouldn't live in such a lonely manner. Thanks to you, things are looking good for me. So I was thinking that maybe you could... I understand. But we don't see things the same way, you know. If you start saying things like that... ...I might start disliking you. Kyoshiro! Hey wait! Kyoshiro! Kyoshiro! THE END
