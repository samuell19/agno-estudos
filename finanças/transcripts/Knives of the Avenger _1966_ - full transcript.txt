The disc of the sun in the arms of man. The scythe of the moon in Odin's lap. Two stars. One is dark. The other still shines. I see... I see, with my mind's eye. The will of the gods. Karin, you have asked me to foretell your fate. Now, I shall answer you. Listen. Before the snow covers the frozen stones of the valley... before the long night covers the frozen winter waters of the sea... your husband Arald will return. He will warm you and your son with his love. He's alive. He's alive! But beware, so is Hagen. Beware of him. You must leave, Karin. A grave danger threatens you. I see... I see a dark cloud looming over your head. Run away, both of you! And don't leave any trace on the earth of your passage. Listen to me, Karin. Let the sea erase your footprints. Follow the coastline, and then walk up the creek. Go! Go away! THE KNIVES OF THE AVENGER Today is a great day. It's a day you will remember for the rest of your lives. Our sentence, to wander endlessly... as if drawn by the sun's enchanted chariot, has lasted long enough. It's been too many years since a roof covered our heads at night. From now on, we shall no longer be forced to wander like young wolves. Until now we have amused ourselves by killing, pillaging... taking the women of the vanquished! But enough is enough! We will take back the village that banished us. And we will decimate anyone who dares stand in the way of our rights... which are exclusively those of might and violence. We'll string them up to dry like cod in the North Wind. And we will be unchallenged masters of the town. Long live Hagen! Long live Hagen! Hagen, have you forgotten the king's curse? The king is long dead. And his foolish prophecies certainly won't hold me back. His son Arald is also dead. He sleeps at the bottom of the sea, food for the fishes. - But his wife and son are alive! - I know. Until now they have eluded us, like sand between our fingers. But now we must find them, and I know who will tell us where they are. - Let's find them and kill them. - Yes, Hagen must be our king. Good. You, go ahead to the village, and take shelter in the forest. The rest of you, with me. Suna, where is Karin? I know she was here. Go on, talk. Answer me. Answer me, you old witch, or else! - Where is she, I said? - Can the sea speak, Hagen? Do you know how to make it speak? Ask it. Question the waves. Question the wind. She escaped along the coast, and the water erased her footprints. The sand is smooth again... so you can never find her. Don't look for her, Hagen. Listen to the voices of the dead, whom I watch over in these caves. They speak through me. Don't look for her, Hagen. Go away! And beware. The gods have not forgotten. The earth is still red with the blood of innocents spilled because of you. And this blood demands vengeance. And this vengeance is not far off. Your time is near. Stop! Stop. That time has not come. That day will come, I know. But it is written in the book of life that you will commit other murders... and they will not be in vain. Because of those crimes, peace will return to this land. Do you delude yourself that I believe in your rants, witch? The gods speak through me. When the time is ripe, and the gods will it... our fates will be decided as it has been written. You will kill me, that day. But remember, Hagen... this too is written. You will die right after me. And the man who will kill you is already on his way. We're not going to let this woman's foolish prophecies frighten us. It will take more than that. Arkan, Yot, search the countryside... look in every farmhouse. I want Karin and her son. But alive! Don't forget, I want them alive. He's on his way. He's on his way. He's on his way. What do you want? Food, hospitality. I will work for you. I don't need anything. Go to the village. It's beyond those hills. You'll find food and lodging. - But I... - Go away. - You needn't be afraid of me. - I'm not afraid. But go away. Is this town so rotten... that you would refuse shelter to a weary and hungry vagrant? Everywhere I turn, all I see is hatred and diffidence. Hatred is a fruitful plant. There's a creek nearby, where you can drink and fish. Here's the milk, mother. - That man didn't look like a bandit. - He may not be one. But, you see, we're alone here, and we can't trust anyone. Mother, for how long must we remain here? In hiding, far away from everyone? You must be patient. If only... I could do something. - I'm not a child anymore. - That's true. Who is this Hagen that the witch was talking about? He's an evil man who did grave harm to us and our people. - Mother, I'm worried. - You mustn't worry, Moki. If only father would come back. When will he be back? - If only I were a man. - You are a man, my man. Your father will return. I'm sure of it. Open up, Karin! We know you're in there! Open up or we'll< break down the door. You can't escape. - Go away! - Cowards! Hold still, or I'll wring your neck. You have to come with us. Come on! Go away, I said! - We have to bring you to him. Move it! - He wants to marry you. You'll be queen. - I'm already married! - But your husband is dead. - Lost at sea. - Come on. Get out! How dare you touch me? You used to be my servants. Do you know what the consequences are for servants who rebel? That was years ago, Karin. We're no longer your servants. - Move it. Come with us. - Let my mother go! - Ouch! Damn you! - No! Stop! No! Mother! This is a nice outfit. Just what I needed. The summer is almost over. We made a bit of a mess. Don't worry. I'll fix everything up. It will only take a few days. I told you, Mother. He wasn't a bandit. See, you have to nook the arrow by resting it on your fist. - Like this, see? - Uh-huh. Before you stretch the bow, bring your foot forward and balance your body. Try it. No, no, not like that. You have to hold the bow straight. Come on. Use your arms and shoulders. Well done. Go get it. Did you see that? I almost hit the center of the trunk. - Can you teach me to throw knives now? - Go get them. He's a man. Soon he'll be a warrior. Someone should teach him how to use weapons. It's strange. From the start I've felt as if I already knew you. Really? Your face reminds me of something, of someone. - Who? - I don't know. Here are the knives. Show me. All right. Pay close attention. You hold it by the blade... firmly, but without stiffening your wrist. As with the bow, your entire body needs to be well balanced. - Amazing. Let me try now. - Wait. I'll show you again. Speed is of the essence. You must carry many knives... and be prepared to throw them one after another. Are you crazy? Cut it out and come inside! If anything, you should cut me some lard for cooking. And debase my knives with lowly kitchen work? Never, woman. Well said. Women belong in the kitchen, and men on the battlefield. Here's lunch. It's time to eat. Here you go. You think you're going to catch fish with your knife? No way! It's impossible! See? It got away. I knew it. Don't laugh yet. Look! It got away! It got away! It's cold. Winter is coming. Look at the little guy. Ever since you got here, he's exhausted at night. That's not true. I'm not tired. - Come on, Moki. Time for bed. - I don't want to go to sleep. Be a good boy. It's late. There. Now be a good boy and go to sleep. The night will soon be over. You'll see. It's short. And first thing in the morning, we're going to set a trap. - Will we catch a fox? - Who knows? Maybe. I'm getting old. I may be nosy, but you're not a peasant. Why do you live here, in hiding? Why? - For my son. - What does that mean? Tell me. - It's a long story. - Tell it to me. You're a foreigner. You don't know this. But I'm the wife of Arald, the chief of the Marvar. A brave and loyal man, loved by all. What happened to him? Three years ago, he left. Our town was hit by a terrible famine. Together with other warriors, he went in search of wheat. But his ship... never came back. Have you had news of him? No,none. - I heard he was shipwrecked. - Where? On the coast of Britannia, they saw him crash onto the rocks. But why are you hiding? Why not stay with your people? To escape from a man who wants to marry me... and become master of the people of my tribe. A man? The one who tried to have you kidnapped. Yes. He has been the cause of all our misfortunes. It all began on the day of my wedding. Arald, my groom, was the son of the chief of the entire North. Our union would have made the tribe stronger, invincible. Everyone was happy, but our happiness was destined to be short- lived. Children, may your union strengthen the sacred blood bonds between our... Karin, Arald, I too have brought you a wedding gift. What is the meaning of this horror, Hagen? It means no more paying a toll to Ator's tribe. We descended on the town in the middle of the night... and we slaughtered everyone, even Ator's wife and son. Unfortunately, he escaped, because he was at sea with his warriors. What's wrong with you? Is this how you thank me for killing our enemies? Not enemies, Hagen. Allies. I had made an alliance with Ator. - And my father had accepted it. - How was I supposed to know that? I'm a warrior, and I know nothing of pacts and alliances. Go away, Hagen, and never come back. It is not your love of country... but your thirst for blood that urged you to carry out this awful massacre. I curse you, Hagen. May the gods spare us Ator's vengeance. Begone! Fine, I'll leave. I'm glad to be rid of all you cowards. Stop, Arald! Go away, Hagen. - Go! - Come on. Let's go. Come on, Karin. Don't cry. Help! But Ator's vengeance came for us that very night. He invaded our land with his warriors, spreading destruction and devastation... burning it down. And the day of my Wedding was not a day of peace. It was an endless parade of nightmarish hours. Then, they came to our town. It's Ator. No! Ator's righteous hatred had been unleashed. His vengeance was slaughtering innocent victims... children, elders, women. Even the king was killed. Arald! Arald! Let go of me! Let go of me! Ah, let me go! No! Mercy! I had done this. Blinded by my pain... urged on by hatred and a desire for vengeance... I had preyed on the innocent, and committed the vilest of crimes. I was known among my people as a kind and just prince. And in one night, in addition to my son and my wife... I had lost the respect of my allies. Why? Why had I been unable to be loyal and fair... and judge them justly? A terrible past that I had tried to forget, that I thought forgotten... is looming before me, very real and close. I can see that night in the most minute detail. I remember everything, perfectly. Ator, this traitor is still alive. Should I finish him off? No. Let him go. He is not the traitor. Hagen is responsible. I know that now. If I should have to wander forever, I'll find him and stab him in the heart. Saddle up. We're leaving. Let them kill me. No. You've already paid. You're wrong to leave me alive. I'll find you. And that day you will curse the day you were born. Perhaps. Odin will decide what is just. But justice was never served. I sought Hagen for years... along frozen tracks, in the fjords, but in vain. It's been a long time. So long I barely remember the faces... as with this woman, whom I had not recognized. She's here alone, isolated. And her downfall seems to me... almost a direct consequence of the harm I did her long ego. Maybe now I can make partial reparation. I can protect her, defend her son. Her son. Perhaps also my son. Who knows? He's loyal, brave, ready to fight. He'll become a good Warrior. Chance brought me to this hut', and I may have found a new fate here. I want to stay by the side of this strong, noble woman. I 'II help her protect her rights and those of Moki. And maybe one day, if she really is a widow... - Is it already time? - No. Go back to sleep. We're almost there. We'll set the trap near the river. We're sure to catch something. You'll see. Okay, put it down. Sit down, and I'll show you how it works. - This is a Danish trap. - How do you know all these things? - I've traveled. I've wandered. - Why? To escape my memories and my pain. But now I'm back for good, if I succeed in catching a prey I've been hunting for a long time. So, look. This is how you set it, so it's barely hanging on. - Give me the bread. - Do animals eat bread? Like us, when they're hungry, they will eat anything. We'll put our bait here. The trap stays open. The animal approaches, walks inside, grabs the bread and... And gets caught in the trap. Animals are stupid, therefore. Why don't they see the trap? Sometimes it happens to men, as well. - Where's Moki? - Down by the river. Karin, I have to talk to you. - What about? - I... I... I have many things to explain to you. - Go ahead. I'm listening. - You see... - It's difficult, very difficult. - Let me go! Moki! Come here! No, let me go! Let me go! - Stop squirming. You're coming with us. - No! No! Damn you! I'll take care of you. - Hold him. Tie him up! - No! Let me go! No! - Did they hurt you? - No, thank you. Enough, Mother. What's a little water? You're still treating me like a child. Moki and I owe you so much. You've saved our lives twice. But it's time for that to stop. Moki, go water the horse. Why did you say that? What does it mean? What is it? Do you want me to leave? We're no longer safe here. Hagen is in the village. - Hagen? - Yes, he's back. Now, more blood will be spilled. Why didn't you tell me earlier? What would have been the use? You're powerless against him. Stay. Don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid for myself. - For whom, then? - For Moki and for you. - For me? The harm they want to do me would extend to you as well. - I don't want to involve you. - But I already am, more than you know. Aside from the affection I have for you... Thank you. But I love my husband. You know that. - How long will you wait for him? - Forever, Ator. Even if I were certain of his death, I will never belong to another man. - That's absurd. - And then... there is my son. One day he must become king of the Marvar. I am the only one who can ensure that his rights are acknowledged. - Do you understand? - Karin, listen to me. Please, let me go. I have a duty to perform. - I can't betray it. - You will carry out your duty in full. And I will help you. When I met you, I had almost decided to forget my revenge. But it is written that oaths must not be forgotten. What happens after that... is in the hands of the gods. Stay a few more days, please. Trust me. - I really should go. - No, stay. What if Hagen comes here with his men? He won't. I promise. Where are you going? This time, I'm taking the initiative. I'm going big-game hunting. You're going hunting? I'm coming with you. No, stay here, with your mother. And watch over her. When will he be back? Tell me. - That man was a demon. - Weren't there three of you, though? Tell the truth. You were drunk when you got there. Listen, do you know what Hagen said when he found out? Nothing. And if I were you, that would frighten me. There were three of them, and they were slaughtered. Dirty coward. Three men against a child, and you came back empty- handed. And those two that I sent to the hut, disappeared. But the man who helped the boy was an animal. My orders must be carried out. You should all remember that. Or you shouldn't come back alive to give me a bunch of excuses. Get rid of the body. Damn it! The wise men want to discuss your marriage proposal. You should speak to them. They're waiting for you. Well? Getting ready to leave again? Something to drink. I found it. I wouldn't sit there, if I were you. That's Hagen's table. It's the only one from which you can see the door and have your back covered. Here. Something to drink. Go on, another glass. Who are you? Where did you get these clothes? Are you deaf and dumb? Didn't you hear what the innkeeper said? You want something to drink? Here, drink. And now that I've drunk, you open your ears. I don't like to drink alone. Tell Hagen that tonight I'll come to drink with him. You're Moki, Arald's son. Answer me! You're very rude, friend. See what happens when you don't listen to me? Learn. So, once I marry Karin, I will be chief even under Odin's law. - Do you understand, Ulna? - What about me? You're beautiful, but you're dumber than a seal. - You think with your body. - Here, eat. Make your brain work, as well. I will marry Karin... but after a few months, she'll come down with a mysterious disease. And her son, grief-stricken, will soon follow her to the grave. And then I'll look for another wife, and guess who that will be. You. You'll be queen, and I'll be king. No eating when the king is courting! Silence, what are you laughing at? For now, this table is my throne. By the way... that man who sat here today, what did he look like? He was an odd fish. He looked frightened, but I would swear he was pretending. One thing I noticed while that madman had me by the throat. He had a tattoo on his arm. It looked like a man holding the disc of the sun. - Did you say the disc of the sun? - Yes, why? - Only one man can have that tattoo. - Who? A man against whom every precaution must be taken. There's the signal. Let's go. Wait until he's right under the tree. Now! Quick, let's go! Damn him! He tricked us. Something to drink. Cheers. I've been waiting for 12 years. There is unfinished business between us, and it's time to settle the score. You're afraid. You're so afraid that you put a shield over your chest. - But I will kill you nonetheless. - Try it. You coward. Your tricks will not save you. I could stick this in your eyes, or in your stomach, but I won't, Hagen. I want to stab you in the heart, so all the poison pours out. Defend yourself! Who's there? Come on out. Get away, stranger. Soon he'll be back with his men. I'm hungry, and then I want to sleep. Come on, get a move on. They're almost done unloading the cargo. - I've never seen them work so hard. - It's only natural, Olsen. They're like horses. They can tell they're getting close to the barn. Three years at sea are long, after what we've been through. I myself, as soon as we landed, only wanted to head straight home. I can't wait to see them again. Karin, my Moki. He must be a man at this point. - In a few hours we'll be home. - You're right. That must be him. You should have come to me, Karin, when I sent my men to get you. You'd be my wife now. But it's not over yet. But today, it's not you I want. - No, Moki! - Mother! If you want him back alive, you'll have to do as I say. Let go of me! So, Hagen wanted to take my place. He wanted to become chief by forcing my wife to marry him. And that man... The man who fought him, who is he? I don't know him. He's a stranger. He's sleeping over there. Get up, Ator. I'll start by settling my score with you. Defend yourself! Arald. Arald, listen, I want to talk to you. No talking, Ator. I could have killed you in your sleep. But you spared me once. Now we're even. But I don't want to kill you. I can't kill you. Even if I was wrong, let me explain. No explanations. I was not responsible for Hagen's actions. You were responsible for yours! Give me your sword. Defend yourself! Go on, kill me! Kill me! Stop! - Arald! Arald, Moki's been kidnapped! - Karin! Hagen took him to the sacred caves. We have to do something! - Quick! - No! - Arald! No! - I'll go. Get him! He's unstoppable! - I'll kill him! - Arald, don't kill that man. He saved our lives. He helped us! What can we do? Nothing. Arald. Arald, I knew... I knew... that you would return. Hagen... I wanted... I wanted... to prevent him... entering the sacred caves. A grave danger hangs over us. Moki... Moki! Save Moki! We will save him. Let's go. You'll see. When your mother receives one of your ears, for starters... she'll change her mind. Or maybe, instead of an ear, we could send her a hand, what do you say? There, eat. And now, let me sleep. I need it. He must have come through here. There are no footprints. Let's go up here. Father! Don't take another step, Arald, or I'll kill your son! Throw down your sword. Get out of here! Coward! Go away without looking back. By dusk I want a ship... with my men aboard, and Moki's weight in gold. These are my conditions, if you want your son back alive. - And once again, I will escape you. - Hagen. Hagen! It's no use hiding behind a child. I can get to your heart also through your back. Try it now, Ator. Stone is harder than your knife. - Hold still! - Let me go! Let me go! Hagen! Well done, Moki. You were very brave. Father! THE END
