Local minister condemns London Government What are you doing? Leave her alone. Sara? Sara? She's cold. We need to get you warm. What happened? You're ok. He helped us out of the car. Do you want it? What is it? We need a doctor. Hey. Iwan. I'm alright. Please. What's in it? I'm okay. What's your name? Stanley. Thank you Stanley. ‘When I was a child, I spoke as a child’ ‘I reasoned as a child, I thought as a child’ ‘but when I became a man, I put away childish things.’ ‘For now we see through a glass, darkly’ ‘but then face to face: now I know in part’ ‘but then shall I know even as also I am known…’ How is the girl? She's sleeping. She should drink this. Right. What time is it? I don't know. Early. What's out there? Nothing. What are we going to do? Leave. Keep moving. What else can we do? You don't think we should go back? There's none in there. Anyway, they're bad for you. You're bad for me. Drink your drink. Go back to sleep. Is there a phone? I need to call someone. About the car. Stanley? No. Sara? What a mess. You should have left it where it was. What are you doing up? - I thought you were asleep. - I'm awake now. How is the leg? Getting better. Thank you. What you got there? Keep it. The photograph in the bedroom. Your parents? Your mum was pretty. She used to take me swimming. In the river. I would hold onto her back… ...and she would swim through the water. You were lucky. Having a mum that loved you like that. Like your shoes! They're all he had. - What's he doing then? - I think he's building a well. There's something about this place. Everything we need is right here. We can't stay. We can't keep running forever. Anyway, what would we do when we got there? - How would we live? - I'll get work. Pushing body parts round a hospital? - If I have to work, I'll work. - But what if you don't have to? We can stay here. Think about it. Our own little world. No more running. No more lies. Just you and me. Come here. You come here. I've been thinking. You should help Stanley with his well. After everything he's done for us. It's the least we can do. - I don't think Iwan... - No. It's ok. That's very kind. That's settled then. - Feels right don't you think? - Yeah. Thank you. Hey. Sh. Do you want me to stop? Stanley? What is it? It was my mother's. I want you to have it. I don't know what to say. You shouldn't put too much it. You won't be able to lift it. The ground is hard. You sure the walls need reinforcing? You sure there's water down here, Stanley? There's water everywhere. Work yourself to death round here, can't even get a drink. Never touched the stuff? I'll bet that's not the only thing you haven't tried. Ignore him. He's missing his cigarettes. They were my father's. Whiskey, nice one Stanley. You're not wearing it. I wasn't sure if I should. It's pretty. You think? It used to belong to his mother. I don't think he had anyone else to give it to. Sad isn't it? Iwan? I didn't go to school like the others. Mam and Dad thought it best that I stay here. What about your brothers? Sisters? There was only me. It's pretty. It sounds old. I used to watch them. Dancing. - In the barn. - Who? Mum and dad. I was supposed to be asleep. But it was summer. It was warm. I watched them from the window. They were so happy. Stanley? John Stanley Evans. Would you care to dance? Iwan? Sara? I thought there'd be a house. Or a phonebox. Something. But the track just goes on and on. No people. Nothing. I thought you'd gone. Would you have minded if I had? We shouldn't be here. We should have left. - This place... - It's what we always wanted? You and me. Our own little world. - And what about Stanley? - You don't have to worry about Stanley. You don't have to. I want to. Iwan. Iwan. Iwan don't. Iwan. Your mum and dad were right. Keeping you out of school. Kids can be cruel. There was a boy at my school. Nobody was allowed to ask what was wrong with him. We just had to pretend like he was normal. I suppose we should've felt sorry for him. But that's not how you think when you're a kid. They have special schools for kids like that now. Back then they just stuck them in with all the normal kids, hoped nobody'd notice. Like nobody's going to notice there's a retard in the class. I'm so sorry. Are you ok? I didn't mean to… They should've drowned you at birth. Saved everyone the hassle. Stanley? Stanley? Are you ok? He's gone. His room. All his things. Did something happen? Stanley? Stanley? Open the door. I know you're in there. He took us in. When we had nowhere else to go. ‘You and me. Our own little world.’ Your words, not mine. Iwan. I'm sorry. About this morning. Have a drink with me. You and me. And this fucked up paradise. You going to dance with her or what? Come on. It's ok. Come closer. What's wrong? Iwan? Must be difficult for a guy like you. Cooped up on you own, year after year. The chickens, they've got each other. - What have you got? - Don't listen to him Stanley. There was a guy in North Wales. He used to fuck trees. You ever heard that story? No. You ever get the urge to fuck a tree Stanley? No. What about a woman? You ever had the urge to fuck one of those? You've never even kissed a woman, have you? Give the man a kiss. - Iwan, please. - Do it. Not like that. A proper kiss. Now that's what I call a kiss. Did you enjoy that Stanley? Do you want more? Unbutton your dress. No. I said unbutton your dress. - Leave her alone. - Don't you fucking dare. Iwan, no. Don't ever touch me again, you hear me? Sara. Sara. Sara. - Please Iwan. Give me a minute. - Open the door. Maybe you should do what she says. Get out of my house. Get out. I was going to tell you. You're still here? - I thought you had gone. - To where? You used to like it when I looked at you. I don't remember. You used to leave the door open… so I could watch you. I was supposed to look after him. Alun. His name is Alun. - Your brother? - Yes. We were playing. By the bridge. He was climbing on the side. It had been raining… I couldn't reach him. The water was cold. Deep. I wasn't strong enough. By the time Dad came to help it was too late. ‘And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.’ Are your parents buried with your brother at the church? My parents aren't dead. They left. Men came, told them they had to go. Why didn't you go with them? This is were Alun and me were born. I couldn't leave him here on his own. Three days they looked for me. Policemen calling and screaming. Iwan. We were just talking. Iwan. Don't be like this. I gave you everything. - Take her. - Iwan, please. Iwan, please. - What happened to you? - Me? What happened to me? Look at yourself. That's what happened to me. I wish I'd died in that car crash. You want to fuck her Stanley? Go ahead. Fuck her. Don't kid yourself though. She's a slut. A dirty little slut. Ask her about that baby of ours. Ask her what was wrong with it? Come on. Tell him… Tell him about how much you like to fuck your brother. Don't be shy, sis. We're all one big happy family now. - What are you going to do? - Leave him. Come on then Stanley. Come on. Iwan, no. I'll never forget the look on her face. The shame. Disgust. She found us, Stanley. Mum. Walked into the room and found her two children together. Sara. Stanley? Sara. You can stay here. With us. Sara.
