LUKE CHISOLM IS A NAME THAT WE'VE ALL HAD ON OUR RADAR SCREENS EVER SINCE HE WON THE TEXAS STATE AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP. FOLKS, IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS HIGHLIGHT BEFORE, SIT BACK AND ENJOY. IT'S SOMETHING YOU WILL NOT FORGET. THE WINNER OF THIS TOURNAMENT EARNS AN EXEMPTION INTO THE VALERO TEXAS OPEN JUST A FEW WEEKS FROM NOW. LUKE CHISOLM HAD A ONE SHOT LEAD ON THE FINAL HOLE OVER JOE BUCKNER, FATHER MARTIN ON THE BAG, AND LOOK WHO SHOWS UP ON THE TEE: THE NUMBER ONE PLAYER ON THE PLANET AND THE TOURNAMENT'S LEAD SPONSOR, TKO. WHAT AN INTIMIDATING PRESENCE. WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH TO RATTLE ANYBODY'S CAGE, AND IN THIS SITUATION, LUKE CHISOLM, HE JUST BLOCKS HIS TEE SHOT WAY RIGHT. HIS DAD MARTIN WANTED HIM... 3-IRON. WHOA. IT'S NOT THE TIME TO START PLAYING IT SAFE. YEAH, BUT IF I MAKE PAR, HE'S GOTTA MAKE BIRDIE TO TIE ME. YOU'RE PLAYING NOT TO LOSE INSTEAD OF PLAYING TO WIN. HERE. REMEMBER WHO WON THE MASTERS LAST YEAR? THAT GUY OVER THERE. YEAH, THAT GUY OVER THERE. TKO GOT HIS FOURTH GREEN JACKET. REMEMBER WHO COME IN SECOND? NOBODY REMEMBERS THE RUNNER-UP, LUKE.

HE SNAPS HIS PUTTER, FLINGS THE SHAFT, AND THEN THE SAD SHOT HERE, HIS FATHER MARTIN, WALKING AWAY FROM SON ON THE FINAL HOLE. OH, MY GOODNESS. HE ENDS UP SHOOTING AN 80 ON THE DAY. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE ONE THAT STARTED WHAT I BELIEVE WAS THE MELTDOWN WHEN HE HIT IT INTO THE HAZARD AND GOING FORTH FROM THERE, FRANK. WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS MIND? WELL, I THINK HE WAS STILL SMARTING, TOM, WITH THE DECISION HE MADE OFF THE TEE, WHETHER TO HIT DRIVER OR 3-WOOD. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY STILL IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND. AND ONCE YOU'VE MADE ONE MISTAKE OUT OF-- I HAD A FEELING THERE WAS MORE GOING ON THAN MEETS THE EYE. WOW. HE CHILLED GOOD. Announcer: WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY INSTEAD. JUST HITTING NEVER GETS YOU OUT OF TROUBLE. THE PROBLEM IS-- WHAT DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE, KILL A COW MYSELF? SO REALLY, THIS IS FARCICAL. WHEN YOU'VE GOT NO CHANCE-- WOW.

I GOT TO SAY IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH. TRY LIVING IT. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I HAVE. I BELIEVE IT. I SNOOPED AROUND IN YOUR STUDY. YEAH? WELL, I CHASED THE TOUR FOR A WHILE. HAD MY UPS AND DOWNS. YOU WANT AN OBSERVATION? YOU WERE PLAYING FROM BACK HERE, SEE? TOURNAMENT GOLF HAS TO BE PLAYED IN FRONT OF YOU WHERE THE TARGET IS. THAT'S A NEW ONE. YOU HAVE THE MECHANICS. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO PLAY THE GAME IN FRONT OF THE BALL. WELL, I'M DEBATING ON PICKING UP A CLUB EVER AGAIN. WELL, I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU. SPEND SEVEN DAYS WITH ME IN UTOPIA, YOU'LL FIND YOUR GAME. SEVEN DAYS? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, IT'LL TAKE YOU THAT LONG TO GET YOUR CAR FIXED, YOU KNOW? SO THINK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT? I'LL BE AT THE DRIVING RANGE 9:00 A.M. TOMORROW MORNING. SARAH. HEY, JOHNNY. I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE SOME COMPANY. GONNA BE FIREWORKS SOON. ALL RIGHT. I ALSO WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR JAKE. HIS DAD BASICALLY DISOWNED HIM AFTER HE CHOSE THE RODEO OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS. HE'S GOT A WARM HEART, THAT'S FOR SURE. I SEE. YOU TWO TOGETHER? NO. EVERYONE EXPECTS US TO BE, BUT... I DON'T KNOW, ESPECIALLY JAKE. [LAUGHS] SO WHAT ABOUT YOU? ME. MOM AND I LOST MY DAD TO CANCER TWO YEARS AGO, SO I SUPPOSE I'M JUST... TAKING EACH DAY AS THEY COME. I'M SORRY. "I SUPPOSE" MEANS GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. JOHNNY SAYS HE CAN HELP ME WITH MY GAME. THINK I SHOULD TAKE HIM UP ON HIS OFFER? [FIREWORKS EXPLODE] WELL, I THINK... I THINK SOME TIME HERE MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. "DONATIONS APPRECIATED. GOD BLESS." NICE. YOU GOT GAME, SON. YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME YOU OWNED THIS PLACE. WELL, YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO YOUR PUTTER. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO BUILD A GOLF COURSE OUT HERE? WELL, ORIGINALLY I MOVED HERE TO GET AWAY FROM THE GAME, BUT EASIER SAID THAN DONE, I GUESS. SO YOU QUIT THE TOUR? WELL, THE GAME JUST WASN'T A GOOD FIT FOR ME ANYMORE. YEAH. OKAY, LISTEN, LET'S GET STARTED. I WANT TO SEE YOU HIT SOME, ALL RIGHT? I WANT TO SEE YOU SWING. THESE ARE A LITTLE BETTER. YEP. WHY DO YOU GRIP THE CLUB THAT WAY? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. JUST FEELS GOOD. WELL, THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER. NOW, LET START FROM SCRATCH, ALL RIGHT? I NEED TO KNOW WHY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO. LIKE THE FOUNDATION FOR YOUR SWING, FROM THE GRIP TO THE FOLLOW THROUGH. NOW GO THINK ABOUT IT AND WRITE IT DOWN. THE FIRST STEP IN FINDING A GOOD GAME IS TO FIND SOME CONVICTION. YOU GOT THAT? THINK ABOUT IT. HOW'D I END UP HERE? [GOAT BLEATS] UNBELIEVABLE. [CROWD CHEERS] [PROJECTOR RUNNING] THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGE YOU'LL FACE ISN'T THE GOLF COURSE OR EVEN YOUR COMPETITOR'S SCORE. IT'S THAT CASUAL COMMENT OFFERED BY SOMEONE, ANYONE, ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD BE DOING IT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE CONVICTION ABOUT WHERE YOUR FOUNDATION IS, THAT OFF-HANDED COMMENT WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF YOUR GAME AND ERODE YOUR CONFIDENCE. NOW, YOU GOT THAT? YES, SIR. THAT'S BEN HOGAN. YEAH. THE ONE AND ONLY. PLACE THE CLUB IN MY LEFT HAND WITH MY THUMB DOWN THE SHAFT. PLACE MY RIGHT HAND OVER MY LEFT THUMB AND MY LIFELINE. THAT HELPS ME COCK MY WRIST IN MY BACKSWING. THAT'S GOOD. I DO BELIEVE. YOU'RE NOT FROM HERE, ARE YOU? WELL, NOT EXACTLY. I'VE LIVED IN A LOT OF PLACES. BEEN AROUND HERE AND THERE WITH THE MILITARY. NO, I'M NOT FROM HERE. HOW'D YOU END UP IN UTOPIA? [CHUCKLES] YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS, YOUNG FELLA. YOU REALLY DO. I BURNED ALL MY BRIDGES. THERE WAS NO PLACE TO TURN BUT HERE. A TOUR PLAYER LIKE YOU, THE PLAYERS YOU PLAYED WITH, WHY HERE? I'LL TELL YOU. PAUL HAWKINS WAS A STUDENT OF MINE WAY BACK WHEN, THAT'S SARAH'S DAD. HE WAS A GOOD MAN-- A GREAT MAN. HE LET ME STAY WITH THEM WHILE I... GOT MY ACT TOGETHER. BEEN HERE EVER SINCE. DID YOU GET IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE? IT'S GETTING LATE. I'M GONNA SEE YOU TOMORROW DOWN BY THE RIVER. DAY BREAK, ALL RIGHT? WHAT DOES THE RIVER HAVE TO DO WITH GOLF? YOU'LL SEE. YOU WILL SEE. Johnny: RHYTHM, BALANCE, PATIENCE. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO STAY IN YOUR GAME. THE SAME WITH FLY FISHING. IT TAKES A CALM MINDSET A FOCUS ON THE FEEL, RATHER THAN THE OUTCOME. IT TAKES EMOTIONAL CONTROL. HEY? ALL RIGHT. TELL ME. WHAT WAS HIS DOWNFALL? HE TOOK THE BAIT. YEAH, BUT WHY? WHAT MADE HIM FALL INTO THAT TRAP? I'M NOT SURE. 'CAUSE HE WAS HUNGRY? NO, HE WAS MAD. I TEASED HIM WITH A SHADOW CASTING, NEVER QUITE LETTING THE FLY TOUCH THE WATER, SO I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THAT FISH OUT OF HIS GAME TODAY. NOW, YOU READY TO GIVE IT A TRY? ALL RIGHT, REMEMBER. TO STAY IN BALANCE IN THE SKIFF OR DURING YOUR GOLF SWING, YOU HAVE TO CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS. OKAY? ALL RIGHT. [EXHALES] BREATHE, LUKE. RHYTHM, BALANCE, AND PATIENCE. JOHNNY, I GOT ONE. NOW CATCH IT. KEEP THE TIP UP. KEEP THE TIP UP. TAKE IT AS IT COMES. ALL RIGHT? EASY. EASY. OH! NEVER FAILS. [LAUGHS] GOT HIM, JOHNNY. HEY, GOOD JOB, SON. WHOO! HOW COMES YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO DO THINGS THE HARD WAY? [LAUGHS] GOOD. HEY! COME HERE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. 30 YEARS AGO, THIS MAN NAMED JACK NICKLAUS TOOK ME OUT OF MY GAME. YOU KNOW HOW? BY STAYING IN HIS GAME. THE CALMER HE WAS, THE MADDER I GOT. AND I TRIED SHOTS I WOULDN'T ORDINARILY TAKE. NOW, THIS LOOK FAMILIAR? A LITTLE HICCUP ON 18. WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT BEAT BY THE GOLDEN BEAR. YEAH, AND SO WOULD YOU HAVE. HA HA HA. NOW TOMORROW WE ACTUALLY MEET AT THE COURSE. FIFTH FAIRWAY. 8 A.M. [ROOSTER CROWS] I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT GOOD TO BE LATE IN LIFE, SON. TIME IS TOO PRECIOUS TO WASTE. I SAID I WAS SORRY. IF THIS WAS A TOURNAMENT, YOU'D BE DISQUALIFIED. NOW, YOU WANNA PLAY LIKE A PROFESSIONAL, YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE ONE, ALL RIGHT? NOW TAKE A SEAT. TAKE A SEAT. TODAY... WE'RE GONNA PAINT. ALL RIGHT? PAINT? ALL RIGHT. ALL GOLF SHOTS START WITH A BLANK CANVAS. WE PAINT THE SHOT WITH OUR EYES FIRST SO OUR BODIES CAN REPRODUCE IT ACCURATELY. NOW... WHAT KIND OF SHOT COULD YOU MAKE FROM HERE? WELL, I THINK-- NO, NO, DON'T THINK. SEE. OKAY. I SEE A LOW PUNCH EIGHT IRON. PLAYING THE BALL BACK IN MY STANCE WITH A SLIGHTLY HOODED CLUBFACE. I CAN SEE THE BALL FLYING ABOUT 30 YARDS WITH SOME HOOK-SPIN, LANDING ON THE UPSLOPE OF THAT HILL, BOUNCING UP AND GOING IN THE CUP. OKAY. NOW GO PAINT IT. MORNING. MORNING.

I SEE UNCLE JOHNNY'S GOT YOU PAINTING ALREADY. YEAH, HE DOES. I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER SHELF. MAYBE ONE DAY THERE'LL BE TOUR TROPHIES ON THAT SHELF. AIN'T NO MAYBES IN THIS WORLD, LUKE. YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, DAD. GOOD. NOW REPHRASE WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ME. ONE DAY THERE WILL BE TOUR TROPHIES ON THIS SHELF. I'M COUNTING ON IT, SON. I'M PROUD OF YOU. YOU READY, COWBOY? [CHUCKLES] OBRA MAESTRA MEANS MASTERPIECE IN SPANISH. I CAN SEE WHY. SURE IS BEAUTIFUL. I MIGHT EVEN GO AS FAR AS CALLING IT UTOPIA. YEAH. I SUPPOSE YOU MIGHT.

YOU CAN'T PLAY IN A TOURNAMENT UNLESS YOU'RE READY FOR THE UNEXPECTED ON GAME DAY. IT SMELLS DELICIOUS. MABEL'S TROUT'S FAMOUS AROUND HERE. MORE FAMOUS THAN HER PIES? COULDN'T BE MORE FAMOUS. AS FAMOUS, MAYBE. BUT MORE FAMOUS? FOR FOOD IN A WORLD WHERE MANY WALK IN HUNGER, FOR FAITH IN A WORLD WHERE MANY WALK IN FEAR, FOR FRIENDS IN A WORLD WHERE MANY WALK ALONE, WE GIVE YOU THANKS, O LORD. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. HE DEFINITELY PUTS THE GAME FIRST. REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE ELSE I USED TO KNOW. THAT HE DOES. HOPEFULLY HE FINDS HIS WAY QUICKER THAN ME. HEY, THERE, STRANGER. HEY. SO WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU CAUGHT A FIREFLY? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID. WELL, THAT'S TOO LONG. COME ON. SHE HAS PAUL'S GIFT. SHE ALWAYS WAS A DADDY'S GIRL. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. HEY, SARAH. WHAT? THESE ONES IN HERE QUIT MAKING LIGHT. THAT'S 'CAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE TRAPPED. IT MAKES THEIR LIGHTS GO OUT. WATCH THIS. FREEDOM'S A POWERFUL FORCE. NOT YET. I'M SORRY. NO, I-- IT DOESN'T MEAN NEVER. IT'S GONNA... IT'S GONNA RAIN. READY FOR TODAY'S LESSON? I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT YOU GOT IN STORE FOR ME TODAY. YES, SIR. TODAY WE PLAY GOLF. GOOD. WHAT SHOULD I HIT, A DRIVER? NO, NO, NO, NO. TODAY WE VISIT THE HISTORY OF THE GAME AND ITS FUTURE. YOU'RE GONNA BE PLAYING WITH HICKORY STICKS AND A FACE-ON PUTTER. OOH. NOT BAD. PERFECT. S.F.T. ONE FOR YOU. SEE IT. FEEL IT. TRUST IT. LITTLE BUTTER CUT OVER THAT LEFT TREE. HOW FAR? ABOUT 310. 210. WHAT'S THE COURSE RECORD? WELL, YOU EVER SHOT A 59? YOU KEEP PLAYING THIS WAY, YOU JUST MIGHT. WEATHER PERMITTING, OF COURSE. [THUNDER] YES, SIR. BOOM. NOT SURE WE CAN GET THIS ROUND IN. THERE AIN'T NOTHING STOPPING ME. I'M SEEING IT, FEELING IT, AND TRUSTING IT. IT'S TIME TO WRAP IT UP, SON. IT'S NOT THE TIME TO START PLAYING IT SAFE. WE GOT ONE MORE HOLE. NO, NO, NO. 59 DOESN'T MATTER, LUKE. IT'S MATTERS TO ME. THAT'S NOT THE LESSON. THAT WAS NEVER THE LESSON. YOU SPENT THE WHOLE WEEK TEACHING ME HOW TO PLAY THE BEST GOLF OF MY LIFE. NOW I'M PLAYING IT. ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING TO ME, LUKE, BECAUSE I'M NOT YOUR FATHER. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MY DAD, SO BACK OFF. NO, YOU CAN'T SPEND YOUR LIFE TRYING TO VALIDATE YOURSELF WITH A GOLF SCORE. WELL, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU QUIT ON YOUR DREAM, LIVING OUT HERE ON THIS GOD FORSAKEN GOAT RANCH. AND THIS IS YOUR DREAM TODAY? THIS? THIS IS YOUR DREAM? [THUNDER] Johnny: YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER, BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DRINK. [THUNDER] I'M SORRY, JOHNNY. I FORGIVE YOU, SON. WHOSE GRAVE YOU DIGGING? YOU'LL SOON SEE. WHAT'S YOURS GONNA SAY? MINE? YEAH, YOUR EPITAPH, YOUR HEADSTONE. WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO SAY ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU'RE GONE, HUH? MAYBE IT'LL SAY YOU SHOT A 59. [CHUCKLES] HUH? I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT. MAYBE WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT BLANK FOR NOW. NO. I MEAN... I'D WANT IT TO SAY... SOMETHING. IT WILL. IT WILL. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR COMING HERE... WAS AN ACCIDENT. BUT ONLY YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT TO DO FROM HERE ON OUT, 'CAUSE, I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CAN TEACH YOU, SON. THANK YOU, JOHNNY. NO, DON'T THANK ME. THANK HIM. 'CAUSE GOD IS ALL AROUND US. INSIDE OF EACH OF US, IF YOU LISTEN... THERE'S A STILL SMALL VOICE OF TRUTH LEADING US... TALKING TO US, AND TELLING YOU THAT YOU... CAN SEE GOD'S FACE... FEEL HIS PRESENCE... TRUST HIS LOVE. YEAH. S.F.T. HUH? S.F.T. GOD BLESS YOU. HAPPY EASTER. Johnny: LUKE, INSIDE THIS BOX IS A PENCIL AND TWO PIECES OF PAPER. ONE IS FOR WRITING DOWN ALL THE TRUTHS YOU LEARNED DURING YOUR TIME HERE IN UTOPIA. THE TRUTH THAT LIFE IS ABOUT FAITH, RELATIONSHIPS, CHARACTER, AND INTEGRITY. THAT GOD HAS A PURPOSE AND CALLING FOR YOU THAT IS MUCH DEEPER THAN A LITTLE WHITE BALL FALLING INTO THE CUP. THESE TRUTHS WILL BECOME YOUR NEW HEARTBEAT, THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR NEW LIFE. THE OTHER PIECE OF PAPER IS FOR WRITING DOWN ALL THE LIES YOU'VE BEEN TOLD DURING YOUR LIFE. LIES LIKE YOUR GOLF SCORE BEING A REFLECTION OF YOUR TRUE IDENTITY AND SELF-WORTH, OR THAT FAILURE IN GOLF IS FAILURE IN LIFE. TAKE THE TRUTHS WITH YOU, BUT BURY THE LIES RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. ONCE YOU HAVE BURIED YOUR LIES, CHISEL YOUR LIVING EPITAPH. * TODAY I FOUND MYSELF * AFTER SEARCHING ALL THESE YEARS * AND THE MAN THAT I SAW * HE WASN'T AT ALL * WHO I THOUGHT HE'D BE * I WAS LOST WHEN YOU FOUND ME HERE * I WAS BROKEN BEYOND REPAIR * THEN YOU CAME ALONG * AND YOU SANG YOUR SONG * OVER ME * IT FEELS LIKE I'M BORN AGAIN * IT FEELS LIKE I'M LIVING * FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME * I'M LIVING FOR THE FIRST TIME * IT FEELS LIKE I'M BORN AGAIN * IT FEELS LIKE I'M LIVING * FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME * FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME * IT FEELS LIKE I'M BREATHING * IT FEELS LIKE I'M MOVING * FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME * IN MY LIFE [KNOCK KNOCK] ALL READY TO GO, ARE WE? YEAH, I THINK SO. DON'T THINK. SEE, FEEL, TRUST. [CHUCKLES] YEAH. NOW, BEFORE YOU LEAVE, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. I HAVE SOMETHING HERE. WELL, YOU'VE GIVEN ME MORE THAN I CAN REPAY, SIR. WELL, GIFTS AREN'T MEANT TO BE REPAID. THEY'RE MEANT TO BE PASSED ALONG. LOOK AT THIS. THAT WAS MY LAST TOURNAMENT. YOU NOTICE ANYTHING? HUH? WELL, YOU'RE NOT ON THE LEADERBOARD. YEAH, THAT, BUT NO. LOOK AGAIN. LOOK AGAIN. LOOK. OH, IT'S THE TEXAS OPEN. RIGHT. THAT'S THIS WEEKEND. YEAH. THE TOURNAMENT'S MAIN SPONSOR IS AN OLD FRIEND. HE SAYS AS A PERSONAL FAVOR HE'LL OFFER YOU ONE OF HIS FREE EXEMPTIONS. ALL RIGHT? HUH? MAN. I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. WELL, I THINK, BETWEEN YOU AND ME, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RATINGS. HE'S PROBABLY HOPING YOU HAVE ANOTHER MELTDOWN, AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN PROVE HIM WRONG. YEAH. WELL, YOU CAN COUNT ON IT. OH, YEAH. NOW, DON'T GO RUNNING OVER ANY OF THEM COWS, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO RUIN MY PIE. WELL, DON'T WORRY. I CAN SEE A LITTLE BETTER NOW. YEAH, YOU CAN. OKAY. GOD BLESS YOU, SON. GOD BLESS YOU. AW, I'M GONNA MISS YOU. I'M GONNA MISS Y'ALL, TOO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING. YOU BET. GOT YOU A LITTLE GIFT. JUST KEEP THE LID OFF IT AND YOU CAN COME VISIT WHENEVER YOU WANT. WELL... TILL NEXT TIME, THEN. NEXT TIME. YOU NEED ANY MORE PUTTING LESSONS, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW. HEY, TOUR BOY. WELL, IF YOU NEED SOME LESSONS ON SOME COWBOY POKER, WELL, YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF. JOHNNY. YEAH. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. NO, I WANNA THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. I REALLY DO. YEAH. AND, SON, I DO BELIEVE. OKAY? YES, SIR. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU. [HONK HONK] LET'S GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT. YES, MOM. HEY, BUD. I GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT. CALLAWAY'S LATEST AND GREATEST. THANKS, DAD. LUKE, UH... MY ACTIONS LAST WEEK... WERE WRONG. I PUSHED YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE TO SUCCEED AT GOLF, AND I NEVER ONCE ASKED IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED. I'M SORRY FOR THAT. WELL, I FORGIVE YOU. I ONLY WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU. I KNOW. I LOVE YOU, DAD. I LOVE YOU, TOO, SON. WELL...[CHUCKLES] AIN'T LOOKED AT MINE IN A WHILE. [CLEARS THROAT] MIGHT BE OVERDUE. GOOD NIGHT, SON. WELCOME HOME. HEY, DAD. YEAH? I ALMOST FORGOT. YOU WANNA CADDY FOR ME THIS WEEK IN THE TEXAS OPEN? WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO THE PRIDE OF THE LONE STAR STATE, THE VALERO TEXAS OPEN. I'M KELLY TILGHMAN WITH PGA TOUR WINNER BRANDEL CHAMBLEE. A COMPELLING STORY THIS WEEK, BRANDEL, WAS THE SPONSOR INVITE, LUKE CHISOLM. Brandel: HOW DOES ONE GO FROM OBLIVION TO CENTER STAGE? THIS MAN KNOWS, KELLY. IN HIS FIRST PGA TOUR EVENT, HE HAS A CHANCE FOR REDEMPTION. Announcer: NOW ON THE FIRST TEE, FROM WACO, TEXAS, LUKE CHISOLM. [APPLAUSE] Brandel: ROUND TWO AND THREE SAW HEATED ACTION ATOP THE LEADERBOARD. SOME OF GOLF'S BIGGEST NAMES PINING FOR THE LEAD. RICH BEEM, STEWART CINK, TKO, AND RICKY FOWLER. Man: COME ON, TKO! Kelly: THIS PRESSURE-FILLED SUNDAY AT THE TEXAS OPEN OFFERS AN ABUNDANCE OF CHARACTERS. STEWART CINK, FOUR TIME MASTERS CHAMP TKO, AND WE HAVE A LOCAL TALENT WITH FRESH WOUNDS. Brandel: THE SURPRISE PERFORMANCE COMING FROM LUKE CHISOLM, JUST TWO WEEKS REMOVED FROM THAT COMPLETE MELTDOWN AT THE LONE STAR EVENT IN SAN ANTONIO. AND NOW, HE FINDS HIMSELF CHASING, OF ALL PEOPLE, TKO, ATOP THE LEADERBOARD. AND, KELLY, YOU REALLY COULDN'T SCRIPT IT ANY BETTER THAN THIS. NO. NO, YOU CAN'T BRANDEL. WE'VE SEEN CINDERELLA STORIES BEFORE, BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN WHAT TKO HAS DONE TO THOSE GLASS SLIPPERS. HE HAS CRUSHED THEM. Brandel: AND WE PICK UP WITH LUKE CHISOLM NOW ON THE 10th TEE. LET'S HIT 3-WOOD. FAIRWAY'S A LITTLE TIGHT. Kelly: CHISOLM PLAYING IT SAFE HERE WITH THE 3-WOOD ON THIS VERY REACHABLE PAR 5. [CROWD GROANS] Man: THAT'S OKAY, LUKE. Brandel: AND THAT SHOT WILL VERY LIKELY PUT SOME DEMONS IN HIS HEAD. IT WAS A SHOT ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THAT THAT STARTED HIS MONUMENTAL BLOWUP A FEW WEEKS AGO. LUKE'S GONNA HAVE TO CONQUER THOSE DEMONS IF HE WANTS TO WIN, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST THINGS TO DO IN GOLF. WELL, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, SON? GO BACK TO THE TEE. Man: HEAD UP, LUKE. WELL, IT'S GONNA BE ONE HECK OF A PAR, DAD. OH, YOU GOT IT. Brandel: HAVING TAKEN AN UNPLAYABLE LIE ON HIS FIRST DRIVE, CHISOLM IS NOW BACK ON THE TEE HITTING HIS THIRD SHOT. LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING WITH THE DRIVER THIS TIME, BRANDEL. AND KELLY, I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DIDN'T USE DRIVER THE FIRST GO AROUND. HE HASN'T SNIFFED MISSING A TEE SHOT ALL WEEK LONG WITH THAT CALLAWAY OCTANE DRIVER. [CHEERING] รท รทPERFECT! EXACTLY AS HE HAS ALL WEEK LONG. SEE YOU IN THE CLUBHOUSE, BOYS. Y'ALL PLAY WELL. Kelly: A PAR AFTER TAKING AN UNPLAYABLE COULD BE A TURNING POINT FOR CHISOLM. THIS SUNDAY HAS GIVEN US A GREAT LEADERBOARD. RICH BEEM CAPABLE OF A BIG CHARGE, QUESTION MARKS SURROUNDING LUKE CHISOLM, AND TKO AS INTIMIDATING AS EVER. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WINDING DOWN TO JUST TWO. A CLASSIC DAVID AND GOLIATH STORY BETWEEN CHISOLM AND TKO. CHISOLM FROM 12 FEET... AND HE SINKS IT! LUKE CHISOLM JUST ONE BACK OF TKO. YOU KNOW HE'S LICKING HIS CHOPS RIGHT HERE, NOT ONLY TO MAKE BIRDIE, BUT TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON TKO TO DO THE SAME AND AVOID A PLAYOFF. REMEMBER, TKO EAGLED THIS HOLE YESTERDAY. AND NOW LUKE CHISOLM WITH HIS SECOND SHOT TO THIS PAR 4 ON THE 18th HOLE. YEAH! THE PRESSURE IS REALLY ON TKO NOW. HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO GO FOR THE GREEN. THIS ONE'S LOOKING GOOD, BRANDEL. IT'S ON THE GREEN WITH A CHANCE AT EAGLE. HE MAKES IT LOOK EASY, DOESN'T HE, KELLY? WHAT AN ANSWER BY THE STEELY VETERAN TKO, WHO DROVE THE GREEN. IF HE MAKES THIS EAGLE PUTT, HE WINS. [CROWD GROANS] AND HOW'S THIS FOR EXCITEMENT? TKO AND CHISOLM ARE HEADED TO A PLAYOFF, BOTH MEN TIED AT 16 UNDER. AND TKO HAS THE UPPER HAND ONCE AGAIN. HE'S NEVER BEEN DEFEATED IN A PLAYOFF ON THE PGA TOUR, AND LUKE CHISOLM, HIS FIRST TASTE IN EXTRA HOLES. THEY'RE GOING BACK TO THE 18th TEE, WHERE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. TKO AND LUKE CHISOLM ARE ABOUT TO TEE OFF ON ONE OF THE GREATEST RISK/REWARD HOLES IN ALL OF GOLF. AND EARLIER, BRANDEL HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS TREMENDOUS FINISHING HOLE. THE FINISHING HOLE HERE IS A GREAT ONE. A DRIVABLE PAR 4 OF 355 YARDS THAT PLAYS DOWNHILL AND GIVES THE PLAYERS A LOT OF CHOICES. BUT THOSE CHOICES COME WITH RISKS. THE GREEN IS PROTECTED BY A TREE AND A BUNKER AND A TREACHEROUS WATER HAZARD. THE GREEN ITSELF IS VERY NARROW AND FAST, WITH A LOT OF SLOPE IN IT. AND A TWO-PUTT FROM ABOVE THE HOLE IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. BUT ONE OF THE WORST PLACES THAT A PLAYER COULD DRIVE THE BALL WOULD BE LONG AND TO THE LEFT IN THAT AREA THERE, BECAUSE AN UP AND DOWN WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. AND HIS PITCH SHOT WOULD MOST LIKELY RUN OFF THE FRONT OF THE GREEN. Kelly: AND THERE YOU HAVE IT, FOLKS. THIS HOLE PROVIDES THE PERFECT STAGE FOR THE DRAMA THAT'S ABOUT TO UNFOLD. WELL, NO SURPRISE HERE, FOLKS, THAT TKO HAS TAKEN DRIVER OUT. OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO MAKE AN EAGLE AND WIN THIS THING OUTRIGHT. BUT IN DOING SO, HE BRINGS DOUBLE BOGEY INTO PLAY. TKO LIVES FOR MOMENTS LIKE THIS. AND TKO IS ONE OF PERHAPS JUST 10 PLAYERS WHO CAN DRIVE THIS GREEN. WE SAW HIM DO IT JUST MOMENTS AGO IN REGULATION. OH, IT SOUNDS LIKE HE CRUSHED THAT ONE. YEAH, IT'S A GOOD LOOKING SWING. ALWAYS IN BALANCE. IT TOOK OFF ON THE RIGHT LINE. BUT THERE'S MORE WIND NOW THAN THERE WAS EARLIER. HE'S GETTING MORE HELP, AND WITH HIS HIGH BALL FLIGHT, CARRYING THAT CREEK SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM, BUT HOLDING THIS GREEN WILL BE. OH, LOOK AT THIS. THIS COULD BE SERIOUS TROUBLE. THAT'S THE DANGER ZONE BRANDEL WAS JUST DESCRIBING. LUKE CHISOLM GOING WITH THE CONSERVATIVE PLAY, IRON OFF THE TEE. NO SURPRISE THERE, KELLY. HE'S STUCK TO THAT GAME PLAN ALL WEEK, AND WITH ONLY ONE EXCEPTION HAS HE STRAYED FROM THE FAIRWAY. HE'S LOOKING TO PUT THIS BALL IN A SPOT WHERE HE GETS THE RIGHT NUMBER, GETS A WEDGE IN HIS HAND, AND HE CAN PUT THE PRESSURE ON TKO. LUKE SEEMS RELAXED. IS THIS THE SAME PLAYER FROM TWO WEEKS AGO? NO, IT'S NOT THE SAME PLAYER. HE MAY HAVE THE SAME SWING, BUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK. WHAT DO WE GOT? 75 YARDS? JUST LIKE IN REGULATION. YEAH. LOB WEDGE. THANK YOU. THIS IS THE SAME SHOT HE HAD JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, HOWEVER, THE SITUATION IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. HE KNOWS THAT GIVEN TKO'S LIE, HE COULD WIN THIS TOURNAMENT. WHEREAS A FEW MOMENTS AGO, HE WAS CHASING. Luke: SEE IT. FEEL IT. AND TRUST. NOT QUITE LIKE HIS HOLEOUT IN REGULATION, BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, A VERY SOLID SHOT. IF TKO WAS LOOKING FOR A GIFT FROM AN INEXPERIENCED LUKE, HE DIDN'T GET IT. TKO HAS A NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE PITCH. HE'S LOOKING AT A TIGHT FLAG, THE GREEN IS RUNNING AWAY FROM HIM, NOT TO MENTION THE WATER. ANYTHING SHORT OF HITTING THAT FLAGSTICK AND HE'S PROBABLY GOING SWIMMING. PLAIN AND SIMPLE HERE, KELLY. HE NEEDS TO PLAY AWAY FROM THE HOLE. IT'S A PRETTY SAFE BET THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A LONGER BIRDIE PUTT THAN LUKE'S 8 FOOTER. THE ULTIMATE TEST FOR TKO, BUT I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM. HE'S DONE IT BEFORE. LOOK AT HIM SIZING THIS UP. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE-- AND HE IS, I THINK, GONNA GO RIGHT AT THIS HOLE. THIS ABSOLUTELY MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. IF HE DOESN'T HOLE THIS, IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THIS BALL'S GONNA RUN OFF OF THE GREEN. THIS WOULD REALLY BE SOMETHING. AND HE'S GOT TO AIM RIGHT FOR THE FLAGSTICK. ANYTHING SHORT OF PERFECT HERE, HE'S LOOKING AT BOGIE AT BEST. THAT'S IF HE'S LUCKY ENOUGH TO AVOID THE WATER. THE ONLY WAY TO PULL THIS SHOT OFF ON THAT LINE IS WITH A LOT OF SPEED A LOT OF SPIN, AND HE HAS TO LAND IT IN AN AREA ABOUT AS BIG AS A DINNER PLATE. AND IT LOOKS GOOD. IT'S GOT A CHANCE. REMARKABLE! HE'S UNLUCKY, KELLY, THAT THAT BALL DIDN'T GO IN, BUT LUCKY THAT IT STAYED ON THE GREEN AND GAVE HIM ABOUT A 15-FOOT PUTT UP THE HILL, AND MAYBE HE CAN PUT THE PRESSURE ON LUKE. AND LOOK AT HIM. HE'S NOT EVEN PHASED. THIS IS A MAKEABLE PUTT FOR TKO. IS THIS WHERE EXPERIENCE PAYS OFF? GENERALLY SPEAKING, FIRST IN IN A PLAYOFF WINS. AND IF HE MAKES THIS, I PROMISE YOU, THAT HOLE WILL LOOK A LOT SMALLER TO LUKE. HOW MANY TIMES HAS TKO BEEN IN THIS EXACT SPOT AND EMERGED VICTORIOUS? IT'S THAT MENTAL EDGE THAT MAKES HIM THE GREAT PLAYER THAT HE IS. HE THOUGHT HE HAD THAT ONE. TKO'S TEE SHOT LEFT HIM WITH A LOT OF STRESS. HIS SECOND SHOT LEFT HIM WITH A LOT OF WORK. AND NOW IT'S LUKE WHO HAS THE WORK TO DO. AND TKO NO LONGER HAS CONTROL OF HIS OWN FATE. THAT CONTROL LIES WITH LUKE CHISOLM. IT WAS A GREAT PAR FOR TKO JUST TO STAY IN IT. BUT NOW THE DOOR IS OPEN FOR LUKE CHISOLM TO WIN THE TEXAS OPEN. ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MIND OF LUKE CHISOLM RIGHT NOW. TWO WEEKS AGO HIS CAREER WAS OVER, AND NOW HE IS ONE PUTT AWAY FROM TAKING THE TEXAS OPEN AND BEATING THE BEST PLAYER IN GOLF IN THE PROCESS. Johnny: LUKE KNEW THIS PUTT WAS MEANINGLESS IN THE BIG PICTURE. HE WAS NOW ANSWERING TO A HIGHER CALLING. IT WAS TIME TO GO TO A PLACE BEYOND TRADITION, TO A PLACE OF BURIED LIES AND UNEARTHED TRUTHS. A REVOLUTION HAD BEGUN WITHIN LUKE'S SOUL. HE HAD A PURPOSE AND A CALLING THAT WENT BEYOND ANY SCOREBOARD. HE SAW, FELT, TRUSTED, AND STROKED THE PUTT OF HIS LIFE. UTOPIA IS DEFINED AS A PLACE OF MYTHICAL PERFECTION, BUT I KNEW DIFFERENTLY. UTOPIA IS INDEED REAL. IT'S A PLACE WHERE THE VOICE OF TRUTH RESIDES AND ETERNAL TROPHIES LINE THE SHELVES. A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS. I GUESS YOU'RE ASKING YOURSELVES WHETHER OR NOT HE MADE THE PUTT. THE BETTER QUESTION IS, DOES IT REALLY MATTER? HOW CAN A GAME HAVE SUCH AN EFFECT ON A MAN'S SOUL? * FEEL YOUR EYES ON ME * SHINE YOUR LIGHT ON ME * I'LL CATCH YOUR FALL * STRUCK A MATCH, THE REST IS BURIED * WISHIN' I COULD WRITE THIS STORY * LIKE A STAR, YOU FLOAT INTO THE AIR * FEELING IT ALL AS THE WIND BLOWS * FEELING IT ALL AS THE TIME GOES * DO YOU FEEL MY EYES RIGHT THERE ON YOU * MORNING LIGHT * BRINGS ME * TO YOUR SIDE * SKIN HEATS * I BREATHE IT ALL * ON A TRAIN, THE TRACKS ARE HAZY * THROUGH THE FOG OUR VOICES CARRY * EVENING FALLS, BUT YOU'RE IN PERFECT VIEW * FEELING IT ALL AS THE WIND BLOWS * FEELING IT ALL AS THE TIME GOES * DO YOU FEEL MY EYES RIGHT THERE ON YOU? * QUIET ALL, LIVE IN SILENT DAYS * STEADY FALL FOR YOU * FEELING IT ALL AS THE WIND BLOWS * FEELING IT ALL AS THE TIMES GOES * DO YOU FEEL MY EYES RIGHT THERE ON YOU?
