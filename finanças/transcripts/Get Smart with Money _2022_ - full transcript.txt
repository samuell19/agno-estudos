[SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYS] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] [PAULA] My name is Paula Pant, We are here to help people save, earn more, invest, retire. The way that we manage our money influences every aspect of our lives, and yet no one ever formally teaches it to us. Because of that, people are missing out on opportunities to make money. [ANNOUNCER] We have expert Ro$$ Mac coming to the stage. For me, it was always Black wealth matters. And the way I wanted to do that was through information and educating the community. Welcome to this week's episode of Maconomics. I'm your host Ro$$ Mac. We are joined now by financial expert Tiffany Aliche who is also a New York Times best-selling author of Get Good with Money. I'm almost like the preschool teacher of financial education. I really focus on the fundamentals. Budgeting, saving, credit, debt, and learning to earn. These are the first steps to what I call financial wholeness. [NEWSCASTER] He's now become a personal finance guru, and not because he made millions, but because he cut back in some radical ways. On the Internet, my name is Mr. Money Mustache, and 15 years ago, I had a dream and was able to retire just before my 31st birthday. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] The thing about money is it really is not very complicated, but what can you use it for other than just buying more stuff? You can buy freedom with money, where you never have to worry about money again, but that's not what we're trained to do in this country.

Hopefully, by the end of the year... I've got a little money in savings, and I'd love to learn some ways to have it do more... I've never put a budget together. I don't even know where to start. I just have no idea how much I should be paying, how much I should be saving... $30,000 of student loan debt, which I may pay off in my 50s or 60s... How do you get ahead without taking out loans... Honestly I have no idea what we're doing when it comes to retirement. I am definitely in a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle... I currently have minimal funds in my bank account... I never had that financial education... Are we investing in the right areas... I definitely need help managing my money... - I really appreciate your help... - Could really use your help... - [WOMAN] ...help. - [MAN] I need help. ["BILLS" BY LUNCHMONEY LEWIS ENDS] Hi, I'm Kim and this is John. We are earning a lot for the first time. Uh, we're also spending a lot and want to know what to do with that money. Uh, whether that's early retirement, or even what the options are. Kim and John are kind of the perfect candidates for financial freedom and early retirement. That just means you have more free time, more mental health, more time to spend with your kids. Hi, I'm Ariana. I am an emotional spender. I am currently buried in a mountain of debt. I am super, super, super excited about meeting Ariana. Teaching women how to gain confidence about their money is kind of my jam. My name's Teez. I got a big payday. A lot of money sitting in the bank. I know I should invest it, but I don't know where to start. Teez, I would look at him and say he's the epitome of a normal athlete, right? You come from the inner city, then you're thrust into making a lot of money. He doesn't necessarily know what to do with it. Hi there. Um, I'm Lindsey. I've been living paycheck to paycheck. I have two jobs, but I still haven't been able to save up any money, and I'm trying to break out of this cycle. Lindsey doesn't realize it, but she has so much going for her. And so if she wants to launch a new career, this is absolutely the best time in her life for her to be able to take those risks. [UPBEAT MUSIC ENDS] [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYS] [LINDSEY] When I was in high school, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I was like, "Yes, this is what's gonna happen." Go to college, go to fashion school, get an internship, get a job, and by the age of 35, be a name-brand designer. One day, I begged my mom for a sewing machine. I wanted to make my ideas come to life. Then we started looking at fashion schools for me to apply to. That's where I really learned to hone my skills. I will say I never completed school, but I at least learned the basics. So, I had this plan, but things change. Hi. How are y'all doing today? - Good. How are you? - Good. - We have a keg of beer so far. - [MAN] Watermelon... Watermelon, hell yeah. I have two jobs right now. I am a waitress at a beer garden, and I am also a bartender at a brewery. I have you at $7.00 today. Two jobs, 50 hours a week. - Y'all doing okay? Lovely. - [WOMAN] Yes, thank you. [LINDSEY] I don't really have a lot of time to be me. Here you go. Because it's all about making that money just to survive. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS] [DINGS] I've got y'all's beer ready. Sorry about the wait. When I get my paychecks, the first thing I do is pay my bills. But, when you're waitressing, you don't know how much you're gonna make. I have not been able to pay all my bills for about 14 months now. My biggest issue is not just that it doesn't pay more money, but I wish I could have health insurance. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYS] I struggle with depression and anxiety, and I would like to take medication for it because I know that it would help me. However, I can't afford that. The amount of money I make definitely eats at me inside. How I strive to be this image that I grew up to believe was successful. I just don't feel like where I'm supposed to be at this point in my life. I feel like I am putting in a lot of work and a lot of labor and a lot of hours, and there's only so much that I can put in, but I don't want to be living paycheck to paycheck anymore. [PAULA] Hey, Instagram. Today, we're talking about reimagining the way we earn money. So that's exactly what I did when I ditched my nine-to-five and built an online business. And I want to help you find a sustainable way to make money. A way that matches your talents and sparks your passion. So, tell me about you. Well, I am a waitress, and I am a bartender, but my ultimate dream is to do something with art. - Lindsey, how old are you? - I am 27 years old. - [PAULA] Twenty-seven. Okay. - Yes. So, I'll tell you about myself in my twenties. When I graduated from college, I got a job as a newspaper reporter and I made $21,000 a year. That's the equivalent of making $11.50 an hour. I was always really frugal, but I kept trying to save money. - To improve my financial situation. - Right. So in spending, the average American spends the majority of their money on the big three. Housing, transportation, food. If you cut back on those three things, that's where you're going to get the biggest savings. Downsizing your house or apartment, taking on a roommate, renting out a room on Airbnb, those are ways you can significantly reduce your housing costs. [LINDSEY] Okay. [PAULA] And you live someplace where a car is necessary, go for the cheapest option that will safely get you from point A to point B. Nothing fancy, just utilitarian. Wonderful. All right, so tell me more about, like, your food habits, generally. I would say a majority of what we spend our food money on is take-out. - That's one thing I want to stop doing. - Hmm. [LINDSEY] My fiancé and I are both in the service industry. We've been around a kitchen all day. The last thing we wanna do is spend an hour cooking. [PAULA] First of all, restaurant food is more expensive than food that you make yourself. - [LINDSEY] Oh, absolutely. - [PAULA] Then there's delivery charges. And you're in the service industry, so I'm sure you're a good tipper, which is great, but like, that adds up. [LINDSEY] It does. [PAULA] So instead of getting take-out, start meal prepping. Go to the grocery store once a week. Do a big batch run of pre-cooked meals for the whole week. Fantastic. Spending less is the quick and easy solution, but there's a limit to how much you can frugal down. There's no limit to how much you can make. I just wish I was making more, and one of the main drawbacks to the service industry is the lack of benefits. You could try to find some type of side hustle or some type of work that you do on your own... [LINDSEY] Hmm. ...that makes enough money that it compensates for that. - Okay. - [PAULA] Right? So, let's talk about the income side of the equation. - That's where the real potential exists. - Yes. What I saw was that in order to make more, I was gonna have to go independent and start my own side hustle, start my own business. There are two different types of side gigs that I want you to be thinking about. Okay. One is gig economy stuff. And so that's immediate, short-term, quick cash, something where boom, you can make money today. What other types of jobs do you think could fill in that gap? I used to, uh, dog sit for families. I love dogs. I love being around animals. - A side hustle dog walking or dog sitting... - [LINDSEY] Mm-hmm. ...that's gonna get money in the door this week. And then also there is the art aspect. I'm really good at illustration. If you can sketch really quickly, imagine if you went to a dog park and you walked up to someone and you're like, "Hey, I love your dog." "Do you mind if I just do a little 2-minute sketch?" You give them that sketch. You put your phone number at the bottom. By the way, I walk dogs. I love that idea! And then the other type of side gig is building out your own business, but it's going to take a lot longer. [LINDSEY] At some point, I would like to get out of the service industry. Deep down at my core, I am an artist, and I always have been. I do a little bit of everything. I do painting. I make costumes. And that's been my dream my entire life of what I would like to do. [PAULA] So the most important thing is that you have the hustle. I've got the drive and the heart. I feel like I just don't have the know-how. - Easy. Easy. I got that. I got that. - [LINDSEY] Awesome. [CHUCKLES] Art is my passion. So I would love to find a way to make money from my art. That is the ultimate dream. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS] [DOOR OPENS] [TEEZ] Growing up, you look at playing football as this big dream. You know, the promised land. It takes one person to break through the generations of poverty or living paycheck to paycheck. [WOMAN] I love the pink one. Go show Daddy. You can show him. [TEEZ] Oh, Mama. A princess. You look sweet! You got on your crown. Who your best friend? My best friend Mama. - [WOMAN LAUGHS] - Oh. - You played me. - [WOMAN LAUGHS] [TEEZ] I thought Daddy was your best friend. [CHUCKLES] [TEEZ] Somebody like me, a young, Black African-American male, that come from where I come from, I thought football was the only way to make money and make a lot of it. [COMMENTATOR 1] It's off! Tabor! Picked up by Tabor. Tabor racing to the end zone! [TEEZ] After my third season in college, everybody was talking about me. [COMMENTATOR 2] One of the best quarterbacks in the nation is Teez Tabor. This could be a pick six! Touchdown! Tabor! [TEEZ] Once I realized I can make a career out of it, it was no way I could stay in school. They talk about you making beaucoup bucks. You got people you gotta take care of. [MAN] With the 53rd pick, in the 2017 master football league draft, the Detroit Lions have selected Teez Tabor. [CROWD CHEERS] [TEEZ] My first check says 1.6 million. A young kid from Maryland, 21, instantly rich. But I had to pay my agent out the gate, and taxes is 40%. I bought my mother a house. I bought this house. A couple jewelry pieces. [SCREEN WHIRRING] Those were the big purchases. I went to Paris. I went to Saint Lucia, Hawaii. Man... But I went from 1.6 to two-something. Two eighty. I'm like, "This will go fast." I'm gonna cool off 'cause I see how quick it can go. [REFEREE BLOWS WHISTLE] Only goal in mind was keep playing football. The money will keep coming in. I played two seasons in Detroit. [COMMENTATOR] On the sideline, he makes the catch, right in front of Teez Tabor. [TEEZ] Everybody in the NFL know if you're not producing at a high level, they're gonna get rid of you. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYS] I ended up getting released. After I got released from Detroit, I ended up going to San Fran. But I break my foot right before training camp. So, they had to release me. Right there. [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [TEEZ] My world came crashing down. [THERAPIST] Let's take it back down. [TEEZ] There were some long nights. Some long nights thinking like, "Why me?" "Why get me all the way here and then take it away from me?" [CAR ENGINE REVVING] That made me take a step back and open my eyes up to my money. One of my good friends told me about the guy who they feel help people with their finances. - What's good, Brodie? - Yes, sir. - Oh. How you livin', fool? - I'm good. How are you? Man, I'm all good, thank you. [RO$$] I'm a financial educator. I opened up my brokerage account to start buying stocks at the age of 18. I'm 31 now, but I'm close to being financially free already. My kids will be financially free. What we're talking about right now is the future, and the way you get invested in it right now is getting out of your own logic of thinking. [RO$$] You know, I ended up working at Morgan Stanley for three years, so for me it's like, man, I just want to start helping our community get better exposure to investing. Better exposure to financial literacy. Like, when did it trigger in your mind, like, "All right, I need to be investing," or any conversations like that? I felt like after my second season, when I ended up getting hurt, me realizing like, "What are you going to do?" Football's been my life since I was four years old, so when I step outside this box, I don't even know where to go, like, where to even start. I'm a fish out of water. -Mm-hmm -[TEEZ] You know... We gotta look at this and say like, "What happens right now?" - If you never get another football check. - Right. [RO$$] And you don't know where to start. The easiest way to become a player at the game, just put your money in the S&amp;P 500 because on average, that's gonna grow at 10% each year. So what is that... You said S&amp;P S... S&amp;P 500. They made... They made an index to say we're gonna buy all of these 500 companies. [SCREEN WHIRRING] [RO$$] So, look, when you're thinking about investing, here's the... Put it in layman's terms, right? By buying a stock, you literally are able to buy a very small piece of a company. An index fund is literally a basket of stocks. You're not just buying one stock. You get to buy a basket of them. And what's great about it, it gives you inherent diversity. In the S&amp;P 500, you have all the sectors that you could think of. Retail companies. There's banks. You got healthcare companies. Technology companies. You got oil and gas, airlines. Now, obviously, the market, you can have disclaimers that the market could go down. There are years the market could go down 10%, but Warren Buffet, if you Google him right now, he's going to tell anybody... He's the smartest investor of all time. He make money the slow way. Right? He's going to tell you, anybody at the crib, Mom and Pop, Grandma know, Uncle Ray Ray know, - just put your money in the S&amp;P 500... - Put your money... ...and it's gonna really build over time. - All right. Let's get into it. - For sure. - [WOMAN] Whoo! - [GIRL LAUGHS] - Not so fast! Want fast? Okay. - Run in the grass though! Be careful! [TEEZ] Our parents always taught us how to, like, fend for ourselves. A hustler's mentality, so, that's what they did teach us, uh, but as far as, uh, savings plans, investment plans, we... we don't know. It's... It's a language that's never taught to us. Daddy gonna catch you. Daddy gonna catch you. - [WOMAN LAUGHS] - [GIRL LAUGHS] I wanna go to the skies. You wanna go to the skies? [TEEZ] I just wanna help my daughter. - Okay. One... - One, two, three, four. [LAUGHS AND SCREAMS] [TEEZ] I wanna make it easier for her than, you know, my people's made it for me. - [TEEZ] Whoo. Yum. - [LAUGHS] [ARIANA] The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another..." Look, he's chasing the puppy. He's chasing the puppy. He's chasing the puppy. "...his mother called him Wild Thing" and Max said, 'I'll eat you up!' "so he was sent to his bed without anything to eat." Oh no! Money was something to be spent growing up. My parents came from the Dominican Republic when I was three. And I distinctly remember my parents having a lot of conversations around like, "Well, we deserve this," or "I want this so I'm going to buy this." I was the first person in my family to go to college. It was like, "Just take out loans. It's fine." But no one explained to me my student loans were accruing interest from the minute I signed them. Or like, why are you allowing an 18-year-old to take out $25,000 a year? Like, how is that okay? And now I'm sitting here with $108,000 in student loans. [BABY COOING] [MUMBLES] The credit card spending started when I was young. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS] I got my first job out of college, and I wound up getting an apartment in New York that I couldn't afford. With no savings. And it went from there. Brunch was easily, like, $100 every weekend. And then, like, my friends were going out, and, you know, they were all buying new clothes. I couldn't always afford it. But I was like, "I deserve this," or "I had a really hard week. It's fine." And then we had kids. And then Amazon and Target became things. I got more credit cards. Buying things for the kids, buying clothes, buying things to entertain ourselves with. I look around sometimes, and it's almost like I see dollar signs everywhere. If I look back at the credit card statements, I couldn't even tell you what it was. And just like buying to buy. My husband was covering the majority of bills so I can focus on paying things off. And it just didn't happen. Like, I tried. I wound up getting personal loans to pay off the cards to make it one lump payment and a lower interest rate. And that decreased my monthly payments, which was helpful because, you know, I wasn't making that much money, but then it freed up all my credit cards. And they wound up getting maxed out again. - Okay. - [BABY COOS] [SIZZLING] It feels like I'm just gonna always have debt. Like, I just am not making the right decisions. [TIFFANY] One of the first steps you have to take when you're that deep in a hole, is you have to ask for help. I know firsthand there are other people that were in debt that are no longer in debt. Tiffany Aliche was a preschool teacher who lost it all and fell into debt during the recession in 2008. I was 30 years old with $300,000 plus in debt. I was like, "Okay. Let me start with the bare-bones basics." Let me list my bills. Let me figure out what my expenses are. She pulled herself out of debt and began teaching financial literacy seminars to women. [TIFFANY] What I just shared with Ariana is even though I made every mistake possible with my money, I was able to regain my footing, and so can she. So, how do you feel that you do when it comes to spending? [CHUCKLES] - Depends on the week. - [BOTH LAUGH] Um... [BREATHES DEEPLY] There are some days that I'm really good, and I spend literally no money on anything, and then there are other days where it's not so great, and I talk myself into buying things that we don't necessarily need. - Before you spend any money... - Mm-hmm. ...there are four questions you should really ask yourself. And those four questions are: - Do I need it? - [ARIANA] Mm-hmm. - Do I love it? - [ARIANA] Okay. - Do I like it? - [ARIANA] Okay. Do I want it? Need it, love it, like it, want it. I'm gonna write these down for you. Okay. "Your needs are," I must have this thing to maintain the health and safety of myself and my family." - Okay. - [TIFFANY] Right? So give me some examples of some needs. - Mortgage, groceries. - Mortgage. Mm-hmm. Loves are this. I want you to imagine if you had... Who is one of the wealthiest people in the world that you're like, "There's someone that can talk about wealth." - Oprah. [LAUGHS] - I was gonna say, yup! [LAUGHS] - Everybody, right? If you had... - [ARIANA] Oprah money. - You get a car! You get a car! - [TIFFANY] Everybody! [LAUGHS] Yeah! Like... Yes, if you had Oprah money, what would you do or do more of? Oh God. [ARIANA EXHALES] - Go on vacation. Travel with the kids. - Right? And often times we skip over love 'cause it can be a little pricey. - Yeah. - You know? So we skip right to likes and wants. So a like is something that will bring you joy for about less than six months. And so wants are just... There's no joy there, just temporary satisfaction. I feel like most of the things I buy from Amazon fall into that category. - [TIFFANY] Okay. - [ARIANA] It's like... - It's easy to press that purchase button. - [TIFFANY] Yes. I want you to think of your needs and loves like a quadrant, right? So needs and loves are on this side and then likes and wants on this side. So when you are focused on your needs and your loves, you're really living in more of your life. And when you're focused on your likes and your wants, you're really living less of a life. [SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYS] At the end of this journey, if I can... not be afraid of money, if I can have the confidence to know that I will get out of debt and I will stay out debt, it would be huge. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS] [JOHN] Do you want kids or kitchen? [KIM] I don't care. [JOHN] Okay. I'll do kids. - Just yell if you need me. - [JOHN] Okay. Beep, beep, beep, beep. There you go! All right! I'm an engineer. - Nice job! - [BOY] Nice job! [JOHN] When COVID hit, they cut a bunch of the team. And I was just part of the... part of the cut. I'm a stay-at-home dad now. Good, buddy. Oh, should we put gas in the car? - Like that's my primary responsibility. - [BOY] It's Dad. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS] Right now, John does everything. Like everything. It's a lot. And it's not always been that way for us, but he's had to learn all of it. - [JOHN] I'm super happy about it. - [KIM] Yeah. [JOHN] 'Cause I have an amazing bond with our kids. [KIM] You do, which is so beautiful. And I'm, like, really jealous all the time. [LAUGHS] And then my ego gets jealous of, you know, how successful you are. - Like, 'cause you are really successful. - Yeah. It's just so ingrained that the way I contribute as a man is to make money. What's up? [KIM] When he started being a stay-at-home dad, I really struggled with becoming the sole income maker and working so much and being unavailable for my kids. Hello! - [WOMAN] Hi! [LAUGHS] - How are you? I am a psychotherapist and women's empowerment coach. There's all kinds of different ways that you can embody a change, a transformation. Part of the reason that we chose to have John stay at home is because my business was growing financially. It was exponential growth. In 2018, it was maybe 70K for the year. And then in 2020, it was about 150, and then this year, in theory, I'll be around 300. But every time we make more money, we spend more money. I want to kind of like, go to the other end of the spectrum and learn how to save, but we need... we definitely need somebody to help us with that. But we learned... Yeah. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] You're about to meet a young man who retired at the age of 30. - Let's get rid of this mop. - [CLIPPER BUZZES] When you do the math on this, it's something like $10,000 of haircuts that this $40 device has saved me. [REPORTER 1] He preaches his financial gospel on his popular blog, Mr. Money Mustache. [MAN] It has become a worldwide cult phenomenon, which has grown to reach about 23 million different people since its inception. [KIM] I've gotten Mr. Money Mustache's emails for years, and I didn't even think that was a possibility that you could retire early. I just assumed that my life was going to be just what's expected. You work until you're 65, and then you can finally have a life. - [MAN] Happy to finally meet y'all! - [BOTH] How are you doing? [MAN] So like, what brings you to me, and what's your goal in changing your life? We're on the cusp of a high income. And so now that we have this resource, we want the tangible steps where we can set ourselves up for the next five, ten years with a plan. So that we can be financially independent after that. Like, what tangible steps did you take at age 30? I was just earning kind of an engineer's salary, which back in that day was $80,000 a year... [JOHN] Hmm. ...and cutting our expenses where we were living on $40,000 a year. You invest the surplus in just a standard index fund, and it just kind of builds up. And then when we got to the level of investments, um, that was enough to live on, that was when we felt safe quitting our jobs. And the definition of "enough to live on" just very roughly is that you have 25 times your living expenses in investments. If your expenses are $100,000 a year, you need 2.5 million dollars invested to sustain that lifestyle. So it's not really your income that matters. It's your spending choices. So I think the first step would be figuring out where your money is going, like, what do you think is the most spendy stuff? - [KIM] This is the embarrassing part. - [PETE] Okay, this is great. So I see shopping, which is a very big category. - [KIM LAUGHS] Yeah. - It's almost $2,000 a month. - Lots of Amazon. - [PETE] Yeah. [KIM] Let's see. I just purchased dumbbells for my Soul Cycle classes. Ballet slippers, birthday supplies, hair stuff, more dog stuff. Everybody's brain has this thing that I call the PJM. - It's Purchase Justification Machine... - [KIM AND JOHN LAUGH] ...and it's a little machine running in their head and it's like... [MIMICS ELECTRONIC BEEPS] ...and it spits out excuses for why you really want to buy something even if you don't actually need it. So the idea is to throw some dirt and grit into the gears of this PJM - to slow it down. - [MACHINE RATTLES] What that means is asking yourself questions like, "Am I really gonna use this thing? How often would I use it?" Anything you could throw in front is going to slow down your purchases, and you'll end up spending less. [MACHINE HISSING] The second-highest category is groceries. How many cheeses did you get this time? - [JOHN] Four. - [KIM CHUCKLES] [PETE] You're spending $1,200 a month on groceries. That is like banquet-level spending for a small family. - You must be... - Doesn't feel like it to us. You must be feeding, like, royalty every night. You potentially could get that down to 500, and that's $6,000 a year, $60,000 a decade, just by tweaking your food spending. Literally have no idea how you could possibly do that differently. I wonder if I could come to like a guest grocery shopping. - [JOHN] Yeah, let's do that. - [LAUGHS] Great. - Five years from now... - [JOHN] Okay. ...what would you like your lives to be like? The idea of retiring early sounds amazing. I'm totally into it, but also creating more space and time to be with the family, to have, um, the bandwidth to, like, actually be present. Yeah. That sounds really sustainable. Like, your plan is not very far-fetched at all. It feels far-fetched to me. I'm glad you think so. - [LAUGHS] - [PETE] Okay. Let's go play with your train set. [KIM] The last few years, we allowed ourselves to be more consumeristic to cope with stress... Only one. ...and as a reward for the hard work that I do. All right. Three. So at the end of the day, I'll, like, buy myself clothes or I'll buy them a toy... [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] ...but now, like, we're ready to start making good long-term decisions as opposed to just, like, getting through that time period. [RO$$] So, like, right now, realistically, all else fails, in two years, you would technically blow through your savings. Right. For me, we got to get all the expenses down. [DINGS] Because you want to invest a portion of these savings. Right? And still be comfortable. How much did you splurge on a couple chains, a couple earrings, a couple watches? - [HESITATES] Sixty... - 60K. So let's do this. Right now, if you would've put $60,000 into the S&amp;P 500, the stuff we was talking about, that $60,000 today... ...would be $112,000. Hmm. All right. Right? Nah, this ain't broke. I want you to see the numbers to just say, "Okay. I've been missing out on money." Know what I'm saying? That one little thing you forgot about. 'Cause we bought a watch and something with it. So for me, my biggest thing is to just show you how the money works. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [RO$$] When you own it, you in the game. - Okay. - You feel me? Like you done laced them up. You between them white lines, and you really in the game. - You feel me? It's game time. - [CHUCKLES] [TEEZ] The only thing I know it's second and ten, third and five, X receive a cut split. Like, I don't... That's what I understand. I just know that I got this much money and I don't have the knowledge on how to keep it. Or how to really make it run a marathon for me. That's why I'm just trying to learn. [TIFFANY] So, first things first. Whenever you're doing a budget, a budget is just a picture of what your money is doing. And if you don't like that picture, you have the option to change it. So your "money out" list looks like this. So let's talk about money in. What do you take home monthly? Um, about $5,000. And then you said you had a second job? - Yes. So I'm... - Okay. I picked up some virtual assistant work. [TIFFANY] Which is about $700 a month. - Sounds right. - Okay. The good news is, there's actually money here. Yeah. [TIFFANY] At your job, do they allow you to split your paycheck? [ARIANA] Yeah. [TIFFANY] See if they'll do it up to five splits. Split it before you get it. Your five splits are your bills account for the home, your Ariana bucket for bills, you have your spending account, and you have two savings. Savings has two functions. For emergencies and dreams. So you're going to put some in your emergency savings account and some in your dream savings. So this is your budget. That's it. A little bit of automation, then you don't have to at the grocery store scramble. - Yeah. - Because you know, "I put aside my money already. It's there. I asked my job to do it." It's there for you to lean into instead of your credit card. [ARIANA] I've tried almost every budget under the sun, and it's never really worked before. So this is really the chance. I'm ready to, like, do this work. I'm ready, like, to get to the point of financial wholeness that Tiffany keeps talking about. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] [WOMAN] Nina, here! [KISSES] Hey! [LINDS
