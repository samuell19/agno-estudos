There's your girlfriend. Hey! Where are you going? Leave us alone. Come on! What are you doing? No girl loves me. They're too rich. No chance. Tomorrow you go to Sokun's to fertilize. Kravaan can go. I said you're going. When does Kravaan work? You'll do it this time. You'll work for me one day. I always work the hardest and I don't get paid anything. You have rice to eat, a house to sleep in. What more do you want? Pay me, then. I'll buy my own food. Why are you being like this? Why did you have so many kids? Fucking cheat! You're wearing boots! What's Thailand like? I thought you weren't interested. How much can you make? I made 8,000 baht a month. - Construction work. - 8,000 baht a month? What was your boss like? If you work hard, no problem. How much do I pay to get there? 500 dollars. But that's no problem. Borrow off the broker and pay him back from your first wages. I want to go. Me too. I'll contact them for you. You should both ask your parents. You have no hope of getting her. Let your parents find you a wife. You rely on your parents. Not really. My parents can't help me. And I'm not going to work for my brother. We're fertilizing again tomorrow. Okay. Where's your bag? Are you going to stay here and work for nothing your whole life? We'll work for a couple of years, make our money and come back. You should stay here. Don't go. Everybody's going somewhere, doing something. I'm not staying. I'm sorry. I can't go. Get out, hurry up! The lady at the back, quick! Over that hill, someone will pick you up on a motorbike. You'll be taken to the factory. Go, quickly! Go, go, go! Go! I only have fifty. - What about you? - I was told I didn't need money. You'll have to work in a different factory. You'll work a month for free because you have no money. - Hurry! - What factory? Pineapple. Quick, don't look back! Wait up, brother. - Did you come by yourself? - Yeah. How old are you? Fourteen. Is it worth the risk? I'm not going back. I have to work for my kids. We'll stick together. Get in! Quick! Faster! Hurry up! Heads this way. Get in, quick! Lie down, head to toe! You, lie on top. Squash in, squeeze your legs in. Cover yourselves with this. You four, here! Get in, quick! Don't slack! I'm leaving now. Bangkok. We'll take the boat to the factory. This is a trick. I'm not going out there. You're not going? You're not going? Get up! Help with the barrels. You'll take us to the factory? Let's go! Useless animals! Waiting for your mothers? Faster, faster! We won't be out here long. Come on, brother. Get back to work! He wants his mother. Can't handle hard work. Back to work! Can anyone swim? I can't swim. I can. Get ready! Bring the net back. Knife. Bring the net. Thank you, brother. What happens to this? Food for pets. Dog food. I have to escape. My family needs money. We just have to work and pay off our debt. We will die before making it back home. I'm going to need my strength. Where are we? No one goes ashore. Stupid! Get up here! Smell good? Let's go! Drop the nets! Stop! You wanna go home? Swim to your mother? The coast isn't far. Lizard. Stubborn animal. I'm fucking sick of you. You waste my food. Motherfucker. Why don't you answer? Let's swim back! Kick! Kick, stupid! Back to work! This is the sea of the dead. You think if you're nice they'll let you go easily? We'll be dead. You're dead! I'm dead! We're all dead! Work! Work! Work! You wanna die? Work! Yes, boss! Yes, boss! We need to get further out. Even further? Too many trawlers here, the fish can't grow. When will our debt be paid? Ah, you're getting better! You speak more Thai now. Animal! When we're back in Thailand I won't see you again. When I was your age, I started on a trawler. I used to bring the captain fish. I've been on the water my whole life. I can teach you everything. I'm gonna look after you. You want a girlfriend? Cherry! Go! He'll jerk himself dry.
