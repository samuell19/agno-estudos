HENRY IV "I love thee, oh gentle ox, and the mild sentiments, of vigor and peace you give my heart". We're almost there. "Agile is man's labor for your love, he exhorts and prods you, and with patients eyes you unfailingly respond.” Hurry, Frida, we're leaving. Is this Belcredi? - Yes, it's him. He was so slim! Excuse me, Marchesa, who's this lady? It's Mama, eldest sister of "Henry IV", who would be my uncle. Would that mourning band you're wearing…? Yes, she died a month ago. She adored him. She hired the best psychiatrists for him. - Watch the road, please. Sorry. She died, in the certainty that her brother was nearly cured. Getting back to that fateful carnival cavalcade, why did your uncle choose to be Henry IV? Because since my name's Matilde, I wanted to be Matilde of Canossa. I don't see any connection. - Neither to me, at first, when he said he wanted to be at my feet like Henry IV at Canossa. Ah, because… - He was hopelessly in love with Matiide, and she, naturally, couldn't stand him. -That's not true. He was pleasant. Among the many misfortunes we women must suffer, are the gaze of two eyes promising eternal love. Such eyes made me laugh, specially then. And yet I'll admit… (I can after so many years) that then I laughed out of fear, because his eyes were very believable, but dangerous. He was unlike the others. Besides, I was too young then and a woman. I would have needed more courage. And so I laughed at him too. On the Bridge of Bassano, we'll take each others hand and steal a kiss of love! And steal a kiss of love. Oh, a kiss of love. For one kiss, so much went amiss. I ne'er thought I'd see the day I'd have to flee… and abandon you. Henry! Henry! His head! What happened? Is he hurt? Answer! Answer! Answer! Hey, busty! Luscious! Take it off! Off! How are you? - You look fine! - Thanks. Always land on your feet, Henry! - You looked like a dead man! It's your turn! - Congratulations, I've very happy. All's well that ends well. - Made of steel! Great physique! - But did you get your head X-rayed? An old lion doesn't give up! - A strong beast! Long live the Emperor! No, he's fine. - Just to be safe. You never know. Make way! What are you doing? Help! Giovanni, where are you? - Over here! Stop! Shame on you! - He'll kill us all! He's got a sword! Be calm! - He's crazy! He's crazy! That's a real sword! A real sword! Good day, Marchese. - Good day, Nicola. Vera, the car! Come, hurry! Come, get out. You've goldfish here? - No, the water's stagnant. Welcome, Marchesa. Frida, darling, come. The gardens are part of the "maniacal” cloister? No, since that night uncle… The boss! We're now entering his habitual grounds. Are there fish there? - No, it's a well. Please, move on. Frida! You don't want to be seen! Stop! A fine start! Good morning. - Good morning, Marchese, Sir. Veruska, greet him. - Good morning, Marchese, Sir. We've entered the Middle Ages. Magnificent. It's magnificent. Most interesting. Your portrait. Look again. It's not me, but you. Frida, let's take a picture. A photo? Your majesty feels well this morning? It hurts here. - Hurts there? - Yes. It's all those women! Women? It's the humidity in the castle. - Too many women! After a certain age, it's not healthy. - What age? I'm still young! There you are, Your Majesty, all done. Thank you. Keep covered now or you'll get cold. Have them pay you well. - Yes, Your Majesty. Goodbye, Emperor. - Until tomorrow. 6 X 38? - 98. Dunce. 9 X 7? 63. 12 X 4? 14 X 13? 12 oxen, less… 7 chickens, 9 lambs divided by 5 donkeys… You're talking nonsense. One can't? When they asked where he lived, a man answered, "On Mattress Street, near Pillows.” Imagine that. Good day, Emperor. - Good day. His Majesty's well? - Yes, yes. Slept soundly? The Empire? - Our boundaries are safe. The Pope's griping as usual. - He's a false monk. Any revolts, plagues, droughts? Births outnumber the deaths. Ah, good. The Empire is gaining strength. Go on! The Duchess Adelaide and Monsignor of Cluny have come for an audience. Who ever sent for them? Your robes? - And the crown? You'll be Adelaide, mother of Bertha of Susa, wed to Henry IV of the Holy Roman Empire. Excommunicated by Pope Gregory VII. You uncle "lives" in the year 1064, which makes him 26. - Lucky him. You'll be the papal ambassador, the Abbot of Cluny. You'll be a plain friar. You must convince him to do penance. But historically, he was pardoned by Gregory VI at Canossa. Correct. But we've been trying for 20 years but the Pope can never forgive him. Every winter we stage the event but… - The staff? Excuse me, my staff. A ring would be nice here too. Thank you. Very nice of you. - Whenever it snows… How do I look? Am I missing anything? Every time it snows, he dons sackcloth and goes out… Excuse me a moment… - Stop it! The doctor thinks himself transparent. Doctor! Excuse me, Marchesa. And he prays. He swears and breaks out crying… Stop it! - …truly heart-reading, full of pathos! Haven't you ever tried forgiving him for once? Yes, we did try it once… - The play would be over. … but he became infuriated, dangerous, so much so that my mother ordered Pope Gregory VI not to forgive him since every time, in spite of… - Shall I kiss your hand? …"No, no!" And he couldn't pardon him. An honor, Father. Let's not behave like clowns. He's waiting for us. Baron! One moment, Your Majesty. - Move along. I'm Maria Adelaide of Savoy, mother to Bertha of Susa, wed to Henry IV. Maria Adelaide of Savoy, mother of Bertha of Susa… Berta is Henry's wife. - What did I say? We thought Adelaide was his wife but she was his mother-in-law. Don't confuse me. I'm Maria Adelaide. I'm Maria Adelaide of Savoy, mother to Bertha of Susa, wed to Henry IV. The throne room. Who am I? - A simple friar. Dear Baron, don't be offended, but you're just a humble person. You look ridiculous dressed like a monk. Is he armed? - Doctor, you're a psychiatrist and afraid of madmen? That's why I became a psychiatrist. I see you're a bit agitated. - I am what I am. Let me be! Tell me, do he receive many visitors? - Depends on his moods. Women? - Even women. Even women? - Yes, many. Especially at first. They come in costume like us? Professionals. - Prostitutes? - Not just them. Watch out. This could be dangerous for you. Stop it, asshole! The Emperor! - Henry the IV of Saxony, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire! Is that Peter Damian? - No, Majesty, just a friar attending the Abbot. Stop it! Stop it. Who is this? Gregory VII. Newly minted. My life is made up of humiliations: my mother, Adelberto, Tribur, Goslar… And now… this sackcloth you see me in. However, I'm prepared to mend my ways. And even before you, Peter Damien, I humble myself. Unless it was you who slandered my sainted mother, stating she committed adultery with the Bishop Henry of Augsburg! No! Not me… no! - What infamy! No, no. - Huh? - No, no. Yes or no? - No! No! - No, you'd never stoop to that. I can't even weep, my lady, for my mother. She came from her convent to visit me, a month ago. Now I hear she died. But I can't mourn her… …because… If you're here now and I'm dressed so… …it means that I'm 26 years old! Then she's alive. - Still in her convent. Yes, and I can postpone my suffering. Look at me. I'm still blonde. For you. I don't need it but one needs external signs of one's temporal limits. You see that, Monsignor? I do, your Majesty. You too, Duchess? Italian? God! And yet one day… How's it possible? How could she do such a thing? Yes, even she. You understand me. But I won't tell a soul. You needn't fear. This fucking sackcloth! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! Let go of me! Let go of me! Behave! - Asshole! I'll break your arm! Majesty! It's me, Bertoldo. Look at the birdie! The birdie! Let go of me! - Tomorrow at Bressanone, 27… Hi, Henry! - Hi. Tomorrow at Bressanone, 27 German and Lombard bishops will sign the deposition of Pope Gregory VII! He's no pontiff, a lying monk! Enough! They came to intercede on your behalf. Yes, certainly to intercede. And besides, Pope Gregory VII is a generous person, understanding, very accessible. And the duchess belongs to the House of Savoy, which has excellent ties with the papacy. Besides, the Savoys are presently in mourning. I doubt you were informed here at the castle. Forgive, forgive us, Monsignor, our excesses. Forgive me, my lady. I fell the full weight of my excommunication. I can't bear that fellow. That's because you take him to be Peter Damian. He's not Peter Damian? - No, he's just a poor monk, your Majesty. None of us can evaluate what we do instinctively. Perhaps my lady understands me better than the rest because you're a woman. I inform you that your daughter, Bertha… You're Maria Adelaide, my mother-in-law. Bertha is my wife… She's here with me. She came following me. And she's freezing, after two nights in the snow. You're her mother. You could show compassion and implore the Pope that he may receive me. Yes, immediately. - We shall, I promise you. But not just receive me. You know that he can move all. All! He calls up dead men. Look at me! There's not a magic art he hasn't mastered. My lady, my true punishment is this. Or that: look! I cannot free myself from this work of magic! I'm repentant and will stay so. I swear until the Pope receives me. But once he lifts my excommunication, you two must implore him, for he can do all to free me from that! To let me live my poor life! One can't be twenty-six forever! Go! Here we go! Gianluigi, where are you? - I'm here! Music! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee… Come down, fag! We beg you, Gregory, forgive him! Come on, Gregory, don't be like that! Hail Mary, full of grace… Open! You false monk! Open! Coward! Let go of me! You coward! Mother of God, pray for us! You cuckold! Let go of me! I'll fix you! I will! Boys, don't be silly. Because you got no family, like I do. - He's always thinking of his family. But try it. Just protect yourself. My mom's a pain in the ass. - Are we slaves here? Are we? Your trouble is your own mentality. A unionized mentality. Union! Don't like it here? Go work in a factory. You go. - Let's all go. You come too and we'll have fun., Who's better off than we are? Who? We eat, drink and look what a pretty waitress we have! - Let go! This one really slays me! - See how big my eyes get. Coffee, everybody? - Yes, love. And more than coffee! - I like the young girls… None for me? Some cake, Emperor? What? Chocolate cake. Is it poisoned, Bertoldo? Let someone else test it. It's always me. They left? - No. Eat. You've eaten nothing, Sire. The Emperor is very sad. Pass the guitar. He'll see you! Could he…? - He could. The height is… - Sufficient. The clock stopped. - 20 years ago. I'll expect you in the music room, but come in quietly. Well then, let's run through it. Bear with us. Please, I ask for total concentration. Come now, we are not here to joke. Baron? - I'm raring to go. Miss, this is no time for laughing! Frida, stop giggling! Don't laugh! What's so funny anyway? Baron? - Yes? - Are you ready? Yes! - From the beginning. Let's concentrate, please. Baron! Quiet! Get moving! I exit. Good night. - Henry! Henry! You must call him earlier, earlier! Otherwise we run the risk of losing him! Don't laugh! What must we do? A counter shock. It's so easy. The bright light when all is naturally dark. The church clock striking again. If we can shake him, thus weakening threads that bind him to his fantasy, of which he accused himself when he stated, “I can't be 26 years old forever.” We'll have freed him from his torment. From this punishment. He himself called it a punishment. We may well achieve a sudden recovery of his sense of the passage of time. And he'll be cured. Salvaged. - Yes, Baron, yes. Like a watch that has stopped. Now, we, with watches in hand, shall await that fatal hour. We'll shake him, hoping he'll start ticking again. Do you really want to lend yourself to such buffoonery. It's too much for a lady. Any woman would do it. Beside I owe it to him. Lies. You just want to insult me. - As if I care about you! The Emperor must think that we've already left. You must change your costume. - Of course. So much for nothing. - I find it ingenious. Truly ingenious. But the mad, you know, can't reason. So what? Who ever said they did? Aren't we basing all on the logic that he'll react accordingly seeing Frida dressed up as her mother 20 years ago? And this is what we've come up with? Frida! Where are you going? - Guys! Frida, please don't wander off! Hurry up. They're 30 light bulbs of 100 watts each, to heighten the explosive effect of the counter shock. Go on! - Give it here! Stop it, guys! Throw down the sword! Go fuck yourself! What are you doing? Who's playing? - Roving minstrels. They hope the Emperor will hire them too. There's so much unemployment. They're good. - So-so. You're off? Yes, while it's still light. Milady, are you headed directly for Savoy or stopping at Susa at Bertha's? Bertha of Susa. Perhaps… - Yes, it depends on the fog, naturally. Monsignor, to reach Cluny do you go through Pomposa, Samarcanda? Yes, for a short stay. But which pass will you take? The Merlo, the Cisa or the Futa? Ah! Don't forget there's an excellent seafood restaurant. I mention fish because of its phosphorous. - Ah, that's why… "Salaam." Now that the snows have melted, the roads are good. - I'm always here. You believe in ghosts? They're frightening. Lift your foot The moment I touched him, he turned red. And that other one, that Peter Damian. Oh, it was perfect! He was too scared to face me again. That's what terrifies them most, is that I unmask them, and uncover their disguise. Yet it was I, who forced them to mask because I liked playing the madman. Your mouth's agape, imbecile? Did you understand? God, what impudence! To show herself to me now with her lover by her side. Pretending to be motivated by compassion, or even worse… ...thinking to cure me. But tell me, can one be calm knowing there's someone trying to persuade people that you are as he sees you? And you are fixed in the esteem of others according to his judgment. "Mad!" I don't mean now what I do as a joke. But before. Before I banged my head falling from the horse. You're looking at each other? What a revelation! Am I or aren't I? So be it. I'm mad. Then on your knees, by God! Kneel down! I order you to kneel before me! Get down! Down! With your foreheads touch the floor three times. Down! Down! Down. Three times. Three times! You must bow before a madman! Get up, you sheep. You obeyed me but you could've put me in a straight jacket. They'd crush a man with a word, like nothing, like swatting flies. Your whole existence crushed by the weight of words. A dead-weight. Here I am. Do you believe Henry IV is still alive? Why not? I'm talking and ordering you living people. I will it so. You think it's just another hoax that the dead are the ones who carry on life? Yes, it would be a joke in here. But go outside in the living world. It's dawn, daybreak, time lies ahead. "This new day", you say, "shall be lived by us." Think so? Give my best wishes to tradition and custom. Don't ever stop talking. Repeat all that has been said before. You think that's life? You only chew the cud of the dead. You don't understand a thing, do you? What's your name? - Bertoldo. Don't be an idiot. Come now. What's your name? - Fifi, go on. Fino… Fino. - Fino? - Pagliuca. Bravo! I often heard you called that among yourselves. You're Lolo? What's wrong? I'm no longer mad. Can't you see? We'll have fun at the expense of others. Fabrizio. Giuliano. And now let's all have a good, long, great lunch. Go on! Laugh, Fino! Landolfo! Ordulfo! Bertoldo! Arialdo! And Henry IV! Should we judge those who left? One a whore, the other a pimp? And the other a quack? Not true! No one would believe it. Yet they eavesdrop, scared to death. And so I ask, if it's not true, why bother listening to a madman? And yet they stand there listening, their eyes popping with fear. But why? Tell me why. I'm quite calm. Look me in the eyes. - Maybe it's because… I'm not saying it's true, don't worry. Nothing is. Look me in the eyes! Look at yourself. You too are scared to death. Because you think I'm mad again. There's the proof! Of what? - Your shock. Because you think I'm mad again! Because you know what it means to deal with a madman. It means confronting someone who shakes the foundations of everything you've built around yourself. Your logic! The logic that sustains your reasoning. The mad, bless them, have no need for logic. Or else… they've their own logic that goes wafting through the air. They're inconstant. Today one thing, tomorrow another. You hang on? They let go, they're changeable. “This can't be sol” They don't agree. But you insist. Why? Because it is so for you and thousands of others. As a child I saw moons in the wall. And I'd have sworn it was true. Whatever others told me, I believed, and was happy. One must… one must cling fiercely to what seems true today, and will seem tomorrow also though it's the opposite of what was true yesterday. Beware… lest you sink like me, while trying to grasp something that truly drives you mad. Being beside someone, looking them in the eyes, as I had done one day. I felt like a beggar in front of a door that would never open for him. Whoever enters, it'll never be you with your inner world, as you see and touch it. But someone unknown to you. It's already dark. I'll fetch your lamp, Your Majesty. - No forget it, I'd rather not. Remember, It must be a jolt, a shock. Giacomo! Fino! Bertoldo! Fabrizio! Bertoldo! Fabrizio! What's all this confusion! Fino! Frida! Frida! Frida! Where are you? You know I get worried, come out! Frida, darling! Frida! No, don't be afraid. Why'd you come here? They sent you? Curiosity? The procession has been going on for 20 years now. They come to cure me but in reality they want to drive me mad. Off the bed. You've taken nothing? Here, take what you want. - No. I don't blame you. They're false, worth nothing. Frida! Where've you been? - Frida, come here. We were searching. - Later. Now we must concentrate on the experiment! At least I'm relieved now. Much more relieved. You remember your lines, don't you? "Henry! Henry!" Loud. And say it in time. Yes: Henry, Henry. Frida, you haven't eaten. We all had a sandwich. I've some hard candy, but you wouldn't like them. They're lemon flavored, too sour. Mamma Mia, help! Lights! - Henry! Henry! Light… might… might set things right! Emperor.Your Majesty… - King. The king… pays for everything. Your beard? - It was annoying me. - Turn off the lights! Lights! - No more of this comedy! You cured him, we know. - What? What is he doing now? - Yes, he confessed it a while ago! And was laughing behind our backs! And my poor mother, forced to dress up! Every Sunday, at her age! We should've had you locked up! Shut up! - What do you know? I wept for her without a disguise. He's becoming mad again. - Mad? He's playacting! - Get out! It's a hoax! Even the rocks are fake! - A hoax? - Don't provoke him! You said, "hoax"? No, we only said that you were cured. Yes. I'm cured. I'm cured! A most interesting case. Study me, study me well. Was it your idea to dress up the mother and daughter? Yes. That's what cured you. By God, a talking portrait come to life. Bravo, Doctor! Thank you. It was nothing. Yes, I'm cured. And now what do I do? Go away with you? - With me, with us. Out to the club? White tie and tails? Or together to the Marchesa's? Wherever you want. To point me out as we go arm in arm, to your dearest friends as Henry IV? No, what are you saying? - We wouldn't even think it. Everybody called me crazy before. Everybody! And I became so! It was an accident! No one was to blame! An accident? Yes, let's call it that. Who was behind me 20 years ago? Why did somebody behind me whip my horse bloody? To betray me? But not on purpose. Just a joke, eh? And so, Doctor, I preferred to keep my madness. To live it out, fully aware of what I was doing. To take my revenge. Obliging those who presented themselves to me to continue it for my amusement, what was for you a hoax for one day, making it become not a hoax but reality. The reality of a true madness! Here you all are: all dressed up, and the throne room, the court and its secret councilors which means… …traitors. I'd like to know what you gained revealing that I was cured. If I'm sane, you're useless. You'll be fired. Look, Doctor. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8… 3, 4, 5, 6, 20 years. 20! 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. I'm cured, gentlemen 'cause I know how to play the madman perfectly with ease. Your trouble is being mad without knowing it. Now we're crazy? - Would you two have come here to me otherwise? I came here convinced of your madness. And her? - She's struck, spellbound by your show of "cognizant” madness. Being already in disguise, you should stay here and live it. - You're nasty. Pay him no mind. His nature is to provoke though the doctor warned him not to. Nothing matters anymore. I've lived this life for 20 years. While you lived these years, becoming someone I can no longer recognize. Because I've envisioned you, like this. You'll always be like this for me. You look like little children who frighten easily. You're a dream come true. You're mine, mine! No, leave her alone! - She's mine! - You're not mad! Stop it! I order you to stop! - You're not mad! I order you to stop! You're not mad! - I'm not? Take that! Uncle, what have you done? - What have you done? This is real blood! - Hold him back! - To the hospital! He's mad! - He's not! Not mad? He's fit to be tied! - He's not! - What's your blood type? Call 113! - What's your blood type? We'll have to lock him up! - It's not possible! Not bad. Turn the lights out, Fabrizio. Shall we go?
