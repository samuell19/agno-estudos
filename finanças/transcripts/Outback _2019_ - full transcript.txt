Thanks for waiting. You can't blame me! Wade! What else can I say, Wade? - Just give me some space. - I'm sorry. Where you headed, guys? The M1's chockas, so we'll double back on Airport Drive. Get you there just as quick. Here we are. 16.40, thanks. Stay here, I'll get the camper. Right. - Thank you, keep the change. - Cheers, mate. Your mate doesn't seem too happy. - I upset him. - Well, go on, cheer him up. Life's too short to mope around. Thank you. And take care of refilling with your washer fluid, as it contains methanol, and is toxic to the human body. When traveling long distances... Wrong side. Right. You didn't get a GPS? - Got one. - You're joking. Downloaded the maps back home. Starting route to Copacabana Beach. You should put the ring somewhere safe. What's the point? I designed it for you, and you didn't even look at it. Shit. Wrong side. No, that's not what I want. Stop! Everything's backwards. This is so confusing. Come on. No, no, no, no. To Harbour Bridge, up here. - That way? - Yeah. There it is. Smile, you're in my video. I didn't ask to be in your video. Come on. Are you excited? I'm excited. This is meant to be amazing. Oh, my goodness! Will you put the phone down for a second? - I wanna film it. - No, you need to put it down so I can use the rearview mirror. That is amazing. I didn't think it was going to be so big! - What'd you expect? - I don't know. Well, which way is the Opera House? I don't know. Down there, I think. Is that it over there? I can't even see it. I don't know, I'm driving, I can't see it either. You can see it on the way back. Wade, I wanna see it now. I can't see it. I can't... I don't even know how to get down there. - There you go. - Cool! I can't really see it. Come on! There's your Opera House. Wade, come on! Look at this place. - Come on, come here. - Yeah. Let's get a picture, come on. At least pretend you're having fun. - Say cheese! - Cheese. Hey, did you know there are 55 different species of kangaroos and wallabies in Australia? Fifty-four more than I ever imagined. Yeah, and 21 out of the 25 of the world's deadliest snakes call Australia home. Hm, comforting. The deadliest being the black-headed taipan. And they're attracted to fear. Didn't the Crocodile Hunter get killed by a stingray or something down here? Welcome to Australia: a giant death trap. It's breathtaking. Oh, I love this place. - There's no one out there. - Even better. We've got it all to ourselves. Right. This is Lisa Sachs, reporting live from Copacabana Beach. With me is my co-host, Wade Kelly, and the two of us are about to go for our first swim in Australia! Whoo! I'm good. Are you serious? We came all this way. Yeah, and we're here. It's nice. You may never have this opportunity again. Come on! Where's your sense of adventure? We got two weeks together. Then what? Hm? Well, let's just make the most of this vacation. - Wade? - Fuck! - What happened? - Got stung by a jellyfish or something. Get out of the water! There's jellyfish everywhere! Ow! God... Oh, my God, Wade? - It kills. - Oh... Goddammit! Sore? Ow, ow, ow, ow... It's looks nasty. You're gonna have to pee on it. What? You're gonna have to pee on it. No way, that's disgusting. Just go down in the sand, no one will see it. No. You're gonna have to do that yourself. I can't do that. They really need to warn tourists about this. That's me done swimming. We should go to Ayers Rock. Apparently, it's called Uluru here. - Don't start this. - Listen to me. We got the coast back home. Not the Australian coast. I know, but at least our beaches are safe to swim at and it's not some death trap. I've mapped it all out. - Every stop. - Screw the map. Look, they've got this really cool place, "Sculptures in the Desert," and they've got these rocks that are carved into artwork. Yeah. And there's lots of cool stuff on the way: big banana, big pineapple, big windmill. Big deal. And there's a Mad Max museum. You love those movies. Only the first and the last one. No. If you've seen one beach, you seen them all. There's only one Outback. What do you say? Don't say no. My brain thinks is 2:00 p.m. How's your leg, babe? Have ever had boiling water poured all over your thigh? - Do you want me to drive? - It's okay. - Are you hungry? - We'll get food on the way. Starting route to Ayers Rock/Uluru. Whoa. Thirty-two hours? - Head east on Beach... - Let the adventure begin. I turned on roaming, but there's no service out here. - No shit. - But what about the maps on your phone? That runs on GPS, not cell service. Do you think it's safe to be out in the middle of nowhere with no service? Where's your sense of adventure now? We're not going off map, we'll stay on established roads. There's lots of small towns along the way. They'll have phone service. I know, but still. This was your idea. Hey, do you think we should get extra? You know, just to be safe? Whatever you want. Okay. I'm gonna see what they've got to drink. Hi. Do you have any gas cans? How cute is this? Yeah. - You all right? - Great, thank you. - No, your leg. - Oh, I got stung by a jellyfish. - Welcome to Australia, partner. - Thank you very much, sir. That your missus that just came through? Yeah, that's my girlfriend. Hey, is this stuff any good? I never had any, it's just for the tourists, mate. I'll get that as well, and whatever Lisa grabbed. 77.16 for everything. - Your bills are so beautiful. - Right. - Where you yanks headed? - The Outback. - Just everywhere, right? - Right. - Uh, Ayers Rock. - Uluru. Yeah, we hear it's beautiful as well. There's a price to beauty, though, isn't there? Don't need to tell you that, though. Thank you. - You okay? - Just tired. Can't we just go back to the way we've been? Forget about the flight over? It's different now. But I'm still here. We're still here. For how long? What more can I do for you? It's not just about you, Wade. Do you know what the flight attendant said to me... when I moved seats? She said I deserve better. I can't keep changing myself for you. Of course not. Why would I matter? Why would we matter? It's always about you. Oh, was that a dead kangaroo? Affirmative. Oh, that's tragic. They're no different than deer back home. Dead deer are no less tragic. It's all subjective. What? You squish insects every single day. If you pull back far enough; kangaroos, deer, - they look like insects. - Really? Well, what about people then? You and me? Same. We're nothing but specks on the planet that's a speck in the universe. Deep. Doesn't make the dead kangaroo any less sad. Yeah. Whatever you say, boss. In 500 meters, turn right onto Major's Road. Proceed to the route. Dirt road from here. Drive carefully. Turn right onto Cattle Run Road. In 150 meters, make a U-turn and return to Major's Road. Wade, why is it saying that? Pull over. I am, okay? Starting route to Ayers Rock/Uluru. What? How are we doing on gas? - Continue on Cattle Run Road. - Fine. We've got over half a tank, plus the can. Oh, I don't like this. These things reroute all the time, faster ways or something. They take into account road works and traffic. Even if they're not connected to service? Maybe we should head back. Are you joking? We've been driving for hours. Yeah, in the wrong direction. What happens if we get lost? We're not gonna get lost. We have more than enough gas, we have GPS, and we're on a road. A dirt road. Yeah, it means we're going somewhere. You know how stupid you sound, right? Would you just trust me for once in your life? Okay. You got the wheel, Einstein. In 200 meters, turn right onto Dry Creek Crossing. Make a U-turn and continue on Cattle Run Road. Perfect. Proceed to the route. Don't do this again. Starting route to Ayers Rock/Uluru. Head north on Cattle Run Road. "You've got the wheel, Einstein." Oh, God! Oh, sweet Jesus. Fuck off! What the hell are you doing out there? - There's a snake. - Get back in the car. I had to pee. - Was it big? - Enormous. The snake was, too. Where are we? The Outback. We came to a fork in the road a ways back, and the GPS wasn't being cooperative. Cooperative? Why didn't you wake me? You were sleeping, so... That's not an answer. We're stranded and alone out here in the middle of nowhere. We're not stranded and alone. I'm here. You're here. We're together. Yeah, for the moment. It's about going away, isn't it? It's a big commitment. You're not even done with your basic training yet. You knew this was coming. You're the one who suggested it. I don't want to be an Army wife. I'm not gonna be in the Army forever. Four years max. Four years is a long time. And long distance relationships are tough, Wade. Uh-huh. You know, we never had a proper relationship. It has always been about what happened. Your mom would want this. Let's get goddamn married, have two screaming kids, buy a house, the whole shebang. You can't keep saying you love me if you don't wanna get married. That's ridiculous, and you know it. I do love you. I'm just not sure we should get married yet. I'd do anything for you. I'd lay down and die for you. I'd do the same, Wade. That doesn't mean we should get married right now. You know, I don't... I don't even know what I wanna do with my life. I need to focus on me before I can focus on us. Goddamn circles. So are we just gonna keep going this way 'til we run out of gas or... We're not gonna run out of gas. We will eventually if we don't come up with a plan. We'll climb up that ridge. We see something up there, we'll drive towards it, be back in an hour. - And if we don't? - We'll go back the way we came. All right, well, can we drive up there? I wouldn't risk taking this thing off-road. It's safer if we walk. Okay, well, maybe I should go along. You know, your leg. My leg's fine, I've got two of them. Really, Wade, I can do this on my own. We're not separating, we're staying together. Okay, three guesses: what's fairy floss? - Um... dental floss. - Nope. Thread? One more. I don't know. Give me a hint. You eat it. Spaghetti. Cotton candy. Oh, right, okay. My turn. Okay. "Boob tube." Well, that's easy. A television set. Not even close. What? I... - Does it involve boobs? - It does. - Tube top. - That's it. You better not tell anyone I like watching the boob tube. - How much further? - Not far now. You got any more granola bars? Last one. - I'll split it with you. - Okay. Wade, we should head back. I don't wanna get stuck out here in the dark. It's just up there. We're running out of water. It's all yours, I've had enough. We'll get up the ridge, have a look and then we'll head back. It'll be easier going down. What are they, Wade? Dingoes? I don't know. If you keep moving they won't hurt you. Nothing. No signal. There has to be something. We hiked all this way for nothing. Not for nothing. Look at this. Let's get back to the camper, get some rest, and drive back the way we came. Give me your phone. Come here. Can you see the car? No. It's over that way. Okay, well, let's go. Come on. It's not far now. You've been saying that for ages. Yeah, it took ages to walk up here, so we're close. - I'm cold, Wade. - Yeah, I am, too. This isn't the way we came. - Yeah, it is. - How can you tell? Everything looks the same out here. We came over the ridge, past the old dead tree. It's the same path. No. We haven't passed the old tree, that was on the way up. Yeah, we have, like an hour ago. It was by all those white rocks. No, we've only passed the white rocks once, on the way up. Just chill out. We're goin' the right way, I just know. Oh, you just know. Great, Wade, that makes me feel much better. This way, I'm sure of it. Of course. Wade, it's different terrain. - Wade... - Don't be ridiculous. You're going the wrong way. You're not listening to me. We're not going the wrong way. This is the way we go! What do you wanna do? Do you wanna stay here? - The car's that way. - We're going the wrong way... It'll be fine, come on. You need to stop and rest. Yeah, yeah, I know. I just thought... I just thought if we... You need to save your energy. I just thought if we use... - This is bad. - It's not good. - This is bad. - Drink this. It's for you. Finish your water. We'll get some rest and then... in the morning we'll find the camper. Yeah, yeah. What time is it? Come on, it's time to find the car. My leg. Can you walk? Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Holy shit, Wade, that's really bad. No, no, no, no, no. I gotta get to a doctor. Pull your pants up, you should keep it covered, you don't want it to get worse. You recognize anything? No, it all looks the same. We should head north. We walked up the ridge. The sun was setting there, right? That would mean we should head south, then. Yeah. Yeah, south. Let's go, I'm thirsty. This all kangaroo shit? I don't know. I'm not an expert on animal poop. How do you even know we're heading in the right direction? If we keep moving... we'll find something. I need water, Wade. Like now. So do you. What do you suggest? Huh? Stop and wait for somebody? You sit, you die. I don't know how much longer I can keep walking like this. We'll be fine. Not without water. You know, if it comes to it, we can always drink... You know, 9/11? People were trapped. This one guy drank contaminated water and collected his urine for his daughter. It killed him. But it kept her alive long enough to be rescued. - I would never drink urine. - You won't have to. I'd rather be dehydrated. Don't worry, we'll be fine. - We'll be fine. - Stop saying that. What is two times six? Thirty-two. Four threes? Nineteen. That's wrong. What? Nineteen was wrong. It's not it. What's not it? What's not it? You need to stop walking. You need to rest. No, no, no. I'm good. - We're good. - You need to stop. Regain our strength. What now? I don't know. If we get out of here... will you still marry me? Yeah. Lisa, you up? You awake? Come on. Let's go. Lisa... Hey... Hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey, come on, Lisa. Lisa, Lisa, hey, come on, baby. Hey! Come on, wake up. Hey, hey, hey, come on. Come on! Lisa! Lisa, wake up! Lisa, come on! Come on! Help! Help! Hey... Come on, come on, up, up. Come on, baby. Come on, wake up. Okay, come on. Come on, baby. Come on, come on. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Please wake up! Ah, Lisa. Help! Oh, please... Oh, please... Please, wake up. I got you. I'm gonna get you home. I'm gonna get you home. Come on. Come on! Hey! Okay. Water... water... Lisa, stay here. I'm coming back. I'm coming back. Wade... Wade, where are you? Oh, my God! Wade... Wade. Wade. I'm coming for you. Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa... Lisa... Wade! Lisa! No, no, no. Where'd you go? Oh, where'd you go? Lisa! Oh, my God, Wade. Where did you go? Just a speck. I shouldn't have left you. You idiot. Oh, you idiot. Where are you? Yes, thank God. Oh, God. Why won't you start? Liquid... liquid... The straw. Lisa! I got water for you! I don't know what to say. I don't know who's gonna find this. Or if anybody's gonna find this. If you are watching this... Stop. Stop watching. Go and find your boyfriend... girlfriend... husband, wife, kids... and just hold them. Tell 'em you love them. Because... you can be in the most beautiful place on earth and... it all means nothing if you're alone. Wade? If you're watching... Sorry I haven't been... the easiest girlfriend. Thank you for being so kind... and loving. Thank you for being there when my mom died. I couldn't have done that without you. I miss you. Wade? Wade. Wade. Wade, Wade. Are you okay, Wade? Wade, Wade. Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah. - You're okay? You're okay. - I'm okay. I thought I'd never see you again. How did this happen? I don't know. I found the car. Is it close? I'm sorry, it's all my fault. It's okay. We can go to the car together. It won't start. The battery... The battery's dead. I left... I left the lights on. It's okay. It's okay. We don't need the car. We don't need it. I got you. You... You gotta follow my line. You gotta follow my line to the car. - Someone will find you. - What? What are you talking about? You gotta get to the car. What is it? What is that? It's for you. - What is it? - It's for you. - It's for you. - Wade, what is it? It's just water. It is. That's not water. It's gonna get you back to the car. Wade, it can't. You can... You can. No, Wade. You can, kiddo. I'm not gonna let you die... knowing it was my fault. You're gonna get yourself home. Be with your dad. I'm not leaving you. You're not gonna get your way this time. You're gonna get yourself home. Please. Why are you saying that? I'll be right behind you, yeah? Yeah. Okay... Okay, baby. I'll be right behind... Wade? Wade... are you okay? What's wrong with you? Help! Help! I don't know how to help you. Wade, please. I don't know how to help you. Wade... I'm sorry I said no. I love you, I do love you. I just wasn't ready. I am now. Say something. - The ring... - Yeah. I thought you'd like it. I do like it. I do. I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. I tried. I tried. I tried. I tried. I'm sorry. Oh, my... Okay... Okay... Go your way... and I'll go mine. Okay. Hey, Mom. I don't know if you're listening to this, but, um... I'm on the plane and... Wade has just proposed to me in front of everybody, and I said no. And I know it probably doesn't even make any sense because everybody knows how perfect we are together. He's everything to me, you know that. I wanted to be with Wade. I want us to get married and have kids, but just not yet. Seriously, what's the rush? We can wait. I have my whole life ahead of me. Mom, I can't wait to see you. Wade?
