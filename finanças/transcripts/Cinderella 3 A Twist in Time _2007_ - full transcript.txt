[girl] Do you remember the story of a girl who lived a life of cinders, and how she found true love because she kept a beautiful dream in her heart? [giggling] Of course it helped that she had mouse friends who could sew and a Fairy Godmother who could do wonders with pumpkins. Well, that girl is me. [giggling] What a perfectly perfect life It's a fairy-tale come true I'm a princess and a wife all because I fit a shoe When I dreamed of love who'd have guessed I'd end up here At the end of a perfectly perfect year [chuckling] Would my perfectly perfect wife put on her perfectly fitting shoes? You found my shoes. [both laughing] Better hurry. Fairy Godmother's waiting. What were the mice using them for this time? Boats. There. - [gasps] - [chuckles] [Cinderella] Oh, what a wonderfully perfectly perfect year! Why should we have to do the chores? I would rather rot in jail - Washing dishes and scrubbing floors - That's just great, I broke a nail Cinderella is in the palace living a life of luxury And we've not once been invited to a ball Or even tea Why don't I get a happy ending? Where's the Prince who'll mary me? When will this horrible nightmare disappear? Pathetic. Oh, what a perfectly miserably awful year [Prince] Give me your hand. [both laughing] Somewhere there must be Someone who'll love me And show me a world that I never knew He'll ask for my hand And I'll say "I do" Oh, wouldn't it be finer than fine If that perfectly perfect love Were mine [woman chuckling] He's a perfectly charming Prince She's a charmingly perfect lass They've lived happily ever since she fit the slipper [Gus] Made of glass Take your places everyone The time is drawing near to celebrate [all] A perfectly perfect year Surprise!. [groaning] [gasps] A perfect anniversary party that we planned for you And I threw in some magic With a bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Just like the night I sent you to the ball So that's how Cinderella did it. Magic. On this perfectly perfect day there is magic in the air Gee, I wonder if that old lady has a wand that she could spare What could ever come between us? I would gladly volunteer [Fairy Godmother] And as for the future, well, it's perfectly clear [all] It's sure to be another magically Tragically [all] Perfectly perfect year Perfect! [grunting] Mother! Mother! Mother! - Anastasia, where have you been? - Slacking off again. Mother, our troubles are over! A stick? Ooh! Let's beat her with it. No, no, no, no. Not a stick. A magic wand. Well, she finally cracked. I saw this nutty old woman and zap! She gave Cinderella the beautiful gown and, oh, the Prince. - I blame the housework. - Oh, I'll prove it to you. Oh, what were those words again? Wappity-pappity-poo? Skip-skip-scadoo? No, I know it. I know it. I think. Oh, no I've got it. I've got it. Bibbidi-bobbidi... Oh! There it is! Child, put that down! In the wrong hands that wand could be extremely dangerous. Now, now give it back to me you silly little goose. No way, Grandma. Bibbidi-bobbidi boo! [snarls and quacks] [Fairy Godmother] Look what you've done. Now give me back my wand. [Anastasia] No, I need it, you silly old garden gnome! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! [gasps] [Anastasia] Oh! Oh-oh. Hello? Hello, hello, Grandma? Oooh! Oh! I... I'm sorry. Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you. So this is how Cinderella did it. What delicious irony. Do you realize what this means, girls? Yes! No more laundry! [groans] It means power, riches, revenge. [both] Oh. I wanna be dirty, filthy, stinking rich! Oh, I want a Prince of my own! Oh please, please, please. - Give it to me! - No, give it to me! Girls! Girls! First things first. Now, Cinderella, to undo your trickery and take what's rightfully ours, I call upon all the forces of the universe! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! Reverse the moon and sun, turn back tide and time, unravel Cinderella's happily ever after to the moment my troubles began! [clock chiming] [gasps] [Stepmother] Stop! [Anastasia and Drizella gasp] [both] Wow. - [horse whinnies] - The Grand Duke! It worked. Magnificent! And no one knows except us. Get ready. This is your second chance. Don't waste it. Where's Cinderella? She's exactly where she was the first time. [Jaq and Gus] Cinderelly! [bugle call] The Grand Duke! Your Excellence. Your Grace. His Grace will now read the royal procla... Pardon me, but we're all aware of his grace's purpose. Perhaps we should just... get on with it. Quite, Madame. Quite. Ooh. [both groan] [sighs] Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. [both gasp] [exclaims] It fits! It fits? It fits! Mother, it fits. Gee. I wonder if it fits. - It fits, it fits! Oh, Mother! - [cat snarling] I'm gonna get my Prince! Woo-hoo! Grace and poise, my dear! [dishes clattering] [clears throat] I hereby declare that we have found the Prince's bride-to-be. - We must return to the palace at once! - [giggling] [glass shoe clanking] No. It can't be. Would Your Grace excuse me? I must have a word with my... maid. Oof! [Cinderella gasps] You look confused, dear. How could the slipper have fit Anastasia? I danced with the Prince. That was my slipper. Here, I have the other one. I'm the one he's looking for. You may have danced with him. You may even have thought it was love. But the slipper fits Anastasia, and that's who he's marrying. Whatever you think happened last night was a dream. [gasps] I don't care where you go or what you do, but you stay away from the palace. Stay away from the Prince. Oh and... clean up that broken glass. [whip cracks] [horse whinnies] Duh... what just a-happened? I... I don't understand. I've... I've always dreamed That my life could be Like a fairy-tale A perfect fantasy Every day a new adventure On some undiscovered shore Was it nothing more Than a dream? Then one magic night With a single dance I found more than just a storybook romance And for once my life was perfect As we glided 'cross the floor And it was so much more So much more than a dream I could say it never happened Just a dream from the start But then I'd live my life With a broken heart... - [bawling] - No, no. No cry, Gus Gus. Princey knows he danced with Cinderelly. Yes, of course he does. Oh, if I just see him again... Yeah, yeah, see Princey! Yes... everything will be alright. - Everything will be alright. - Duh... yeah, yeah! 'Cause in a Prince's arms I've found a love I can't deny If there's any chance to set things right I've simply got to try So I'll trust my heart What else can I do? I can't live in dreams If my dreams are to come true There's a better life that's waiting Past the mountains I must climb I will take a chance on love to get my once upon a time [sighs] Oh, I want so much more So much more Than a dream [chirping] [Jaq] Cinderelly, big blue guards. [growls] Gus Gus handle 'em. Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em! [chirping] Um... Let's try the servant's entrance first. - [man 1] Good morning, sir. - [man 2] Good morning. - Onions for the King. - Well done. Strawberries. - [chirping] - Keep out of sight. The King is waiting. There you are. - The King will enjoy them. - They're his favorite. Hmm? [groans] Now, all we have to do is find him and everything will be... Stop! You there. Who are you? What are you doing here? I... I'm in charge of all the servants in this castle, and I've never seen you before. What is your purpose? My purpose. Well... um... I... I... - I'm the royal mouse catcher. - [both gasp] Royal mouse catcher? Preposterous. Snap 'em and trap 'em. That's my motto. Oh, no! In the 30 years that I have supervised... - [dishes clattering] -...this castle, I can assure you there has never ever been a single, solitary... - [woman] Mouse! - [glass shattering] [women screaming] - Where is it? - Mice! [chuckling] [hollering] Oh, please, let me help. This is my kitchen. I'll take care of it! Take that! And that! Vile vermin! Please, I can handle this! Not now! I've got them on the run! Really, I can help. [groans] [growls] There he is! I got him! I got him! So then, I'll just go get those mice. [glass shattering] [Cinderella] Come on, guys. - Nice work. - [Jaq and Gus cheer] If we split up, we'll find the Prince faster. Split up! Righty-o! - But, Dad... - Those aren't reasons! [groaning] Breeding, refinement! These are the reasons to marry someone. Not their choice in transparent footwear! [groans] Ooh! Nice parry. Thanks. [both straining] It's not about the slipper. It's the girl in the slipper. She was... Well, she was... She was what? [grunts] Well, she was the one. I know it. [King] You think there's only one woman in the kingdom who wears a size four and a half? It's all I have to go on here. Oh, poppycock! [King moans] You remember when you met Mom? You said the first time you touched her hand... ...you just knew... instantly. Mmm. The stars were brighter that night. Dad, you found true love. That's all I want. - [bugle call] - Oh! They found her! [creaking] [gasps] Zug-zug! [Grand Duke] Now, if you ladies would please have a seat, the Prince will be right with you. My Prince! Your Highness! Oh, hello. Am I in the right room? Of course I'm in the right room. Um... Well there... There seems to be... a little mix-up here. I assure you, Your Highness, the slipper fits my daughter's foot. [sputters] See? See? Huh. How could he miss it? Oh, yeah, I see. Um... It's just that I was expecting... Well, someone else. I really do feel awful about this. But the royal proclamation declared... Yes, but it would appear that, uh, more than one girl actually fits the... the slipper. [clears throat] I'm very sorry to have inconvenienced you. Um... Why don't I have the Grand Duke escort you home safely. - [whimpers] - If you'll please excuse me. Phew! - But... but... - Quiet! You will forget who you danced with at the ball, and marry the girl who fits the slipper... ...tonight. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. [groans] Wait. Hold the trumpet! It's all coming back. It is you. [both gasp] Please. Please tell me your name. It's... Anastasia. [sighs] Anastasia. Well, l... I know it's sudden, but will you marry me? Yes! Yippee! [laughing maniacally] [grunting] Ah! [Stepmother clears throat] Yes. Er... I... I mean, yes. Definitely yes. I will marry you. Excellent. The ceremony will take place tonight. I trust that meets with your approval, sire. The sooner the better. Splendid. Then tonight we will have a new princess. Wonderful. I'll go tell my father. Not good! We have to find Cinderelly, Gus Gus! - [door opening] - [Anastasia] I feel better already. [Stepmother] Grace and poise, girls. Just remember, grace and poise. - [glass shoe clanking] - [Anastasia] Right. Grace and poise. - Oh, look, a harp. - [plucks harp] - [harp shatters] - [plucking stops] [gasps] - [Stepmother] Lucifer? - [purring] [sniffing] Lucifer? [meows] - Lucifer! Come here! - [snarls] Phew. [gasps] [Cinderella] Your Highness. Yes? Hello. [giggles] Um... Hello. It's wonderful to see you again. Um... I'm sorry, have we met? [giggles] I believe we danced last night at the ball. [chuckles] Well, uh... maybe you've mistaken me for some other prince. I don't think so. You are quite the dancer. Well, it wasn't just me. It was the lady I was... ...dancing with. Oh, Your Highness. Uh... As a matter of fact, I'm gonna marry her. Marry? Really? Yes! Tonight. Tonight? Once you dance with someone like Anastasia, you don't want to waste any time. Did you say Anastasia? Yes. But... Well... I guess I better be going. I've got to tell my father. - But that's not right. - I'm sorry? You there. Royal mouse catcher! I need you this... Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Your Grace. I didn't realize... I was the one... I need her this instant! Please excuse us, Your Highness? Please. I'm sorry, just one moment. No, no, no. Of course, I can see you're busy. I'll... I'll let you go. But... it was me. Start here! I want this castle completely rodent-free in time for the wedding. [door slams] [Gus] Cinderelly! Cinderelly! Gus? Cinderelly! [both] Whoa! [Jaq] We found Princey! I did too. But he doesn't even know who I am. No, no, no! It's a magic. What? What are you talking about? [both babble incoherently] Stepmother? - Fairy Godmother? - Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. She stole it? - [bawling] - I show Princey! Princey! Princey! My Cinderelly awaits. Princey, you will marry Anastasia. Anesthesia. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. She made him forget who I am. Magic! That explains it. Boys, we have to get that wand! Madame, the King himself has instructed me to be solely in charge of this affair. I assure you I have it entirely under control. Oh, really? [scoffs] [Anastasia and Drizella gasp] [Anastasia] Look at that! It's perfect! [Drizella cackling] They smell lovely. Dispose of those roses at once. Anastasia's health is quite... Ah-choo! ...delicate. I'm quite sure I mentioned that to you. - Madame, I do not... - Quite sure. Yes. Well, perhaps the young ladies would like to sample the hors d'oeuvres. [Anastasia and Drizella gasp] Your Grace, a word. [mutters] These preparations are entirely unacceptable. [slurping] What a pig! [Drizella] Who's the pig now? [laughs] [Stepmother] You call this a cake? [snarling] This wedding must reflect my daughter's elegance. Drizella will be singing in the ceremony. Are you sure that's a good idea? Oh, wait till you meet her, Dad. She has everything. - Breeding, refinement... - Yes, yes. No! [plate shattering] Are we in the right room? You! How could you let this happen? [laughs nervously] Don't mind this. I shall have it cleaned up in no time. See that you do! I want this wedding to go off without a hitch. And if it doesn't... Oh, no! Please, sire... I can explain. I well, you see... Father, allow me to introduce my bride-to-be, Anastasia. Anastasia, this is my dad. It is an honor, Your Majesty. Charmed, I'm sure. So who's up for a dance? [Stepmother] Your little escapade back there could have cost us everything! Don't ruin this! Go get him, twinkle toes. [orchestra warms up] Oh, I don't dance much. You're too modest. That's how we met, remember? Oh, right. Of course. I'll never forget when I first touched... ...your hand. [orchestra plays Blue Danube] - [groans] - Oh! I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [Prince groans] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [gasps] - [groans] - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - [moans] - Oh! [screams] I'm sorry. Oh, dear. whimpers] Um... Are you OK? Oh! Oh, sorry, these aren't my shoes. I mean, what am I saying? Of course they're my shoes. Oh, I just don't know what's wrong with me today. Oh, no, no, it was my fault. I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date on the latest dance steps. [clears throat] Sire, if I may, um, your fitting. Oh. Oh, yes. This was fun. Thank you. Well, if you'll please excuse me. [chuckles] Um, come along, sire. And after the fitting, we must approve the butter sculpture. I think it's a stunning likeness. ? La-la-la-la-la-la... Well, no grace, no poise. Other than that, it was lovely. He was nice to me. [snickering] That's because he's under a spell. He'd have to be, to fall for you. It's more than that. [King] Ladies! [Stepmother] Your Majesty! [King] I need to speak with my future daughter-in-law immediately. Alone! Let's make a run for it while we can. No, sire, sire, I'll have a dozen dance instructors sent in immediately. Something's wrong. [gasping] An army of dance instructors. No, no. I thought... Why, I was sure it was Anastasia last night. But... ...well, just now when I touched her hand... ...I felt... ...nothing. Oh, I can explain everything, Your Majesty. I have this, this inner ear thing and, and... You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer. Yes, I know, Your Majesty. Reminds me of my queen. She trod on my feet too. But she took very good care of my heart. [chuckling] Come here, my dear. I want to show you something. A princess is bestowed with many riches. Land, jewels, horses. But today I wish to give you something much more valuable. Oh. Isn't it lovely? A seashell? This shell was the queen's most treasured possession. We found it while walking by the water the day we met. You see, we reached for it at the same moment, and when our hands touched... [chuckles] ...that's when I knew I had found true love. You knew that just by touching her hand? There's no more powerful force in the world than true love. [clears throat] Well, that's all. Run along, now. - Run along. - Thank you, Your Majesty. I do. Oh, I do. I do. I do. I really do. [giggles] [gasps] Oh! [giggles] Oh, I do. Now there is finally someone to love me He'll show me a world that I never knew With two simple words, all my dreams will come true I do I do [chirping] You go get the Prince. [Drizella cackling] Bigger! Ooh, let's try this! Oh, that's gorgeous. [laughs] Lovely. Drizella, stop that this instant! [groans] This wand is not a toy. It's in the dresser. Key's in her pocket. [grunts] I've got to get in there. Cinderelly! They'll see you! - Yeah, too dangerous. - But l... We'll take care of it! [Anastasia] I do. I do. I do. I do. Oh, I do. Alright, but whatever you do, stay clear of Lucifer. Zug-zug. No Lucifee. What happened? What'd the King say? [groans] He's really very nice. He gave me his most prized possession. [scoffs] A seashell? It's a symbol of true love. [yelps] Oh, please. - [scoffs] How special. - [Anastasia] He said that his heart... [Stepmother] What's love compared to the power we hold with the wand? You will learn that soon enough. [snoring] [Anastasia] I want the Prince to love me. I think he could. [Drizella cackling] Oh, you're serious. [Anastasia] Well, the King likes me too. He treated me like his own daughter. Maybe we shouldn't be doing this. [Drizella] Maybe I should have put on the slipper. [sniffing] [Anastasia] Maybe we don't even need the wand. [meows] [yelps] Oh! [Drizella] Oh! Somebody put out the cat! [Anastasia] Lucifer! Oh, hold still! Stop! - Lucifer! - [meows] [Stepmother sighs] Someone fetch the housekeeper. [knocking] [Cinderella] Housekeeping. Well, you certainly came quickly. [clears throat] We're very good. Clean this up. My daughter needs her beauty sleep before tonight's wedding. [scoffs] Think that'll be enough time? Keep out of the maid's way, girls. There's a lot to do before the wedding. Hmm? [straining] Isn't that right, Cinderella? [gasps] I didn't know you worked here. You're far more persistent than I thought. I won't let you get away with this. - We already have. - I don't think so. Jaq! Gus! [both shout] - The wand! - [both shriek] [snarling] [Gus] Us coming, Cinderelly! - [thud] - [meows] [Jaq] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! That servant girl is a thief! Get her! Zug-zug. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. [snarls] [guard] Stop! Thief! - Seize her at once! - Don't move! Hold it! Halt in the name of the King! [both] Whoa! You incompetent fools! [both] Whoa! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! [meows] [chuckles] [snarling] Gus Gus! - [screaming] - [snarling] Run, Gus Gus! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! [both shriek] [guard] There she is! We've got her. You there, halt! Halt! Open up in the name of the King! - [chirping] - [grunting] Oh, hello. Oh! Hey! What's going on? Hmm. Uh... Alright, I'm coming. [Jaq] Cinderelly! [guard] Open up, I say! Gus Gus! Catch. [guard] Open up in the name of the King! Lift the spell. Let him remember. Bibbidi-bobbidi...! Ooh! No! - What's going on? - My apologies. It's a problem with my maid. - It's under control. - Are you OK? - This servant girl is a thief. - I am not a thief. You're under a spell. That's why you don't remember me. Please! Just listen! [groans] Let go! [tsking] Poor child. Obviously out of her mind. I hope she'll be alright. She seemed, you know, nice when I met her. Well, maybe a little confused, but, still there's something about her... Oh, don't trouble yourself, Your Highness. I'll see to it, personally, that she gets all the help she needs. Nice try, but we won! [cackles] You won? What do you mean? Uh... Well... ...nothing. I... um... You'll see she's taken care of? Personally, Your Highness. Put her on the next ship leaving the kingdom. I want her banished forever. Mmm. And you... Keep your mouth shut or you're next. [chuckling] Quite fetching. - Ouch! - [door opens] Careful with those pins down there. - [door shuts] - Dad, something strange is going on. I'll say. My son is finally getting married. No. No, I mean something's wrong. Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted the girl who fit the glass slipper. - Yes, but... - Now you've got her. Hey. That's what I'm worried about. [whistling] Psst! Hey, Princey! Prince! - Over here! - Princey! Psst! Psst! - Me? - Yes, you. Let's go. OK, first birds, now mice. [Gus] Come on! Hello? Hello? Uh... Iittle mice? Well, it's official. I've lost my mind. First I was hijacked by birds, and now I'm talking to imaginary mice. [birds chirp] [whistling] Hey, Prince Prince! Down here! OK. Maybe not so imaginary. Stepmother got a magic wand, put spell on you. Fooled everyone. ...came to the palace to marry you! Wait, hold on. Hold on. I think I understand. Actually, I got nothing. Duh... What should we gonna do? Ahh! [music plays] You were dancing with a vey pretty girl - Pretty girl - At midnight she ran off - In such a whirl - Such a whirl Her name was Cinderelly She's the servant girl you met She's the one you want to mary Don't forget! Don't forget! - At the ball, at the ball - At the ball, at the ball Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball No, I danced with Anastasia at the ball. No, no. Princey only think that because of Cinderelly's stepmother. Yeah, mean old lady.

At the ball! At the ball! Yeah, at the ball Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait! You're telling me I'm under a magic spell? And here's the worst part.
