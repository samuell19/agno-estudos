- God punished me, He made me blind! - Me too. What are we going to do? No, Saint Lucy pardoned me, I still can see! Speak louder! - Why don't you explain it to us? - We might see their panties! Their panties? - If you could see their... - Can we see their ankles? Or maybe some low-cut neckline? - Worse! I mean, better! - What, then? They are naked, as naked as hens... that were... plucked! - Here, some salmons! - No, these are men! - Let's go teach a lesson to these pigs! - Let's wash them real good! Let's go! Here's one! Dive! Come on! Here he is! Dive! How are you? How about going to sell those three salmon on the market, Zenabel? - Don't step on my feet, idiot! - I can't help! I can't see anything! You saw enough for today! - But I didn't see anything! - Quiet! Can you believe it, Zenabel! Now you have to hunt men down! This is modernism! When I'll hunting men, it won't be those simpletons, but a real man! - If it does exist! - Why not me? We have fresh fish to sell! Who wants some? We even cleaned it, that doesn't happen often! Since when do you feel the need to go rinsing in the stream, dirty old man? Since the well of the house dried up! Come on, ladies! Nobody wants some fresh fish for dinner? Or after, maybe! It's not fresh, Zenabel ! This fish is rotten! - Don't insult me, woman! - Move it, fat guy! We'll settle this at home! You are the shame of the family! Can you feel that? Careful, Zenabel! Don't be too familiar with men! Well, stop laying into us, then! Quiet! Quiet! From now on, men will have to learn to respect us. Otherwise, they'll have to do without us! Well said! - And you listen to this raving lunatic! - Learn to respect me! Did you get it? - Get what? - You'll have to do without me! - I start now, then! - Me too! Girls, let's go! I know this face! Come on, drink! Suchlonglegsl What about the rest? Can you show us? I'll show you nothing! Nojokes, right! Don't drink too much, it's bad for your kidneys! Come here! In the pigpen! For you, it's social progress! Come down! In the middle of the fight! Let's go! I don't want to get involved in the fight! Move out of the way! Zenabefl Zenabel! Where are you? No... No... Zenabel What's wrong, Pancrazio? You were right, Pancrazio! She really was in the middle of the fight! I'd like to know where this girl grew up! Hurry up your father dying again - And he'll heal instantly, again! - No, this time, you're wrong! He seems to believe it. He asked for two priests! TWo? Hey! But what are you doing? It's for real, then! No! Not with the pigs! I'm not involved, I told you! Zenabel! Zenabel! - Pancrazio, tell them I'm not involved! - I'll tell the pigs! What if they don't understand you? In the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. I think I'm already in heaven, because I see a blonde angel. That's me, father, Zenabel. That's you? Thanks God, that's you. Before dying, I have to tell you an important secret about you. Think of healing, father, don't waste your breath. Listen to me. I have to tell you I am not yourfather... - You mean Mamma... - How dare you! My wife was a saint! Zenabel, you are... You are... He's so boring! You are... You are... Come on! Tell me who I am. Maybe it's better not to know. A duchess, a real duchess. Zenabel, you are the legitimate daughter of the Duke of Valle Stretta. A cruel Spanish baron hatched a plot against him. Unfortunately, your father was the worst fencer in Europe. - Speak! Where are the children? - I don't know... Come on! Ready! Your nanny ran away with your twin brother and you. You were still babies. Fate led her to the place where I was waiting for the 7.27am stagecoach. We nobly confronted each other in order to decide who would take the responsibility for your salvation. We finally decided to take one kid each. Since then, I have always seen you as my own daughter. Now, my conscience is clear. He's dead. - Let's take things, for the trouble. - Let's take everything. - Well said! - Are you praying? Oh, the Lord already answered your prayers, take this candelabrum. Not the clothes: he always dressed like a tramp! May the devil bedamn you! Stealing from a dead man! Put everything back immediately! Ah, it's always the same story. It's not serious! When you're dead, you're dead! Take this in yourface! Back off! You fooled us once again. What about the story of the duchess? This time, I really thought I was dying. What I told you is real, I swear. Take this seal. It proves your legitimacy as the duchess of Valle Stretta. With that, you'll even have the right to tithes, for robberies and hold-ups. I'm not interested. I don't like abuses, wealth, and revenge. Wealth, abuses and revenge will never be our goals! I, Zenabel, legitimate duchess of Valle Stretta, promise to dedicate my dukedom to the recognition of the freedom of women. And to their independence. In Valle Stretta, women won't have to obey men, or to bow to their whims. I swear on this seal. We'll only have one motto: "lt will be the way we want it or it will be without us!" The way we want it or without us! They'll end up with their legs in the air. Let's go, haPPY inventive women, Woe betide the ones who'll stop us, They'll regret it! Mercy! Help! Stop her! Finally! We had a good hunt, today! What are you afraid of? We only want to do our duty as soldiers. Would you like for us to rape each other? Help! Help! I have him! I am the first! Second! Here, let's draw lots. Iam still a virgin! I was destined for the baron! Don't worry, we'll treat you as a baron! - I have an arm! - I have the other! - And I have her leg! - No, I don't want to! No! No! I'll give you what you want! Come on, girls! Take this! Here! Here! Your turn! Hooray! Look! The only difference between a woman and a man is the pants! I see another one. Luckily, he's tall enough for me! My fine lady, how can I thank you? There's only one way: join us. You'll be a woman aware of her rights. - Help! ' He“) us! Help! The trap! It worked! Let's have a look! The blood is rushing to my head! It's not the right time to lose your temper! Calm down! But you don't understand! My brain! - It will go through my ears! - Take him up! To be honest, I was hoping to find a better game than those two rabbits! Ah, my head! What are you two doing here? Have mercy on us, noble lord! No glory for you with two unfortunates like us, noble lord! But... but it's not a lord! Zenabefl Why are you dressed as a man? What would your father say? Ah, now I understand what you're doing here! I bet my father sent you to spy on me. No. He threw us out. And Why did he? Who knows? Ah, here. Unless it's for this: a few worthless silver things we were satisfied to get in exchange for the two last years salaries that this old cheapskates didn't pay to us. Right? - Right. - Here is it! - With interest, of course. - Now, we'd like to come with you! - Absolutely! - You? No men! That's alright with me, Zenabel. We resign from our rights as men. Right, Pancrazio? Actually... To be honest, I'm willing to do any sacrifice. I'll do anything to help you and stay close to you. Forward with you! Forward, until the end! Alright. But don't you forget: - Here, it's just us men! - Only men! What if we said, in order not to create confusion, that it's just us women? Pancrazio! Pancrazio, are you staying with us? Stop, woman! We just made an oath! We are like you, now. I don't make no difference. What's wrong? It's not fashionable? - Mirror! - Right now. No. Bravo! Where did you learn? A little lower. Here, like that. You're tickling me! We're all the same, huh? You're hurting me! Not here! Not here, it hurts. Here. Wonderful. Here. That's it? What a shame! What are you doing, half naked? The sun burns. I just wanted to cool off. The white one is the baron's favorite. But what are we going to do? If it's a stallion, it will be easy. You're disappointed, right? One step at a time, we go forward Nobody is stronger... Hey, Zenabel ! Count me in! Wait! We want to come with you! Welcome! Welcome here among us! That's good, girls! You left your families, too? - You did the right thing! - Hooray! - It's for a good cause! - We'll show them who we are! Yes, they'll see who we are! Hey, nice girls will always be welcome, here! Stop! Let's stop here for tonight. Go pick up some wood! Water the horses! Light fires and place guards! Hey, we are not guards. Don't tell me you are tired! - Your husband abused you? - No, he abused the other women! And you? Your husband abused other women too? No. He didn't abuse anybody. That's precisely the problem. And you? Why did you dump your husband? Because he loved men, that's why! At least, with them, he did something! She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. No need to insist, Pancrazio, I don't even listen to you! She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. She loves me. Not at all. Now, I get it! You should be ashamed, Pancrazio! You forgot your promise! - She loves rne. She loves rne! - I didn't know you were such a ladies' man! - Hey! But that's a message! - Let me see! This might be private! "To the baron Alonso y Moira in Valle Stretta. "Will arrive with a famous secret weapon from the Godi Di Sotto pass. "At dusk. Complete success of the mission. "Captain Granata of the Spanish guards." Nice secret weapon! It's a dead body! - Lia, remember the Trojan horse. - Let's attack, then! Let them come closer. A secret, huh? There was another pigeon! Forward! Thanks for the message. Try to hurry, crooks! Stop! Are you crazy? Let them kill each other! We'll pick up the pieces. Bring this secret weapon to the baron! Remember, Fiorella: no trinkets. Right? Too bad! I wonder what's in there. Are you happy? So that's why we risked our lives! What are we going to do with a dead body? In my country, when you talk about a treasure, we call it "the dead". You didn't know, Zazé? It would be the first dead body I'm happy to see! What if it was really a dead body? Stop and drop your weapons! Now, turn back. Look at that! A flock of hens... and two capons! Don't worry, Zazé. Mustaches grow back. Stop! Don't move! Another step and I'll kill you! So kill me. - I deserve it. - No! Spare him, my good lady! It's Gennaro. I know him, he's a bandit. But he's against the baron, too. If you don't like my face, aim at that! It's without a doubt a target you know better! Don't move! Well? You freak! You really shot! Wait, you damn bitch! You know you could have hurt me? Where are you going? Come here! I'll show you! Your bottom is going to burn! No need to run! You can't escape me! But... where have you gone? One step at a time, we go forward. Nobody is stronger than us. - Now, the hens are caged! - Do you like kisses, Gennaro? Let's place a good explosive charge and send all this to hell! You and your departed ancestors can go to hell! Miracle! A speaking war machine! Congratulations! You got the mailman! I hope I didn't upset you. Sending our dead to hell, that's nothing serious. Big deal! We caught the court poet! Mad Cecco, that's my name! Inventing things is my passion! I'm here because the cruel baron wanted to steal my latest invention. And you, who are you? We are a happy bunch of idiots looking for gold and finding hens and pigeons! Don't despise the pigeon you see, it's way more precious than you think. Probably, maybe I was mistaken. But I'm getting tired of this thing. Let's go! Hey! Where are you going, you second-class bandit? You're just a chicken thief! But I'll teach you the lesson you deserve! Really? One of these days, you'll run into the one who'll teach you the lesson I didn't teach you. Good bye! Ignorant! You're right, he's ignorant. Pigeons are the weapon of the future. They're not only there to be roasted! Roasted? Carmelita! CARMELITA'S TAVERN What if we took advantage of the sergeant being drunk to seduce his wife left alone. Ah, no. I would take advantage of the wife being lonely to seduce the drunk sergeant! No luck, Carmelita! We'll drink forfree, tonight! - Specialty of the house. - What? What! It's pigeon! Where... where did you find it? Murderer! - Carmelita, my love! - Oh, you! Leave me alone! Put this on. If they ask you what you do, tell them you work here in exchange for food and a bed. Here, they watch strangers closely. Be careful. The captain is the man you need: he can give you the pass to the dukedom. Why is it so difficult? I absolutely need to go there! That won't be easy. The baron ordered not to let anybody enter. The virgin hunting festival will soon start. I could go there. I'm a big virgin and hunting Ioven Besides, that's a sport that intrigues me! Pancrazio, don't even try or you'll deal with me! - You depraved man! - Oh, stop it! You'd better hurry, before the captain is dead drunk. Soben he's already stupid enough! Come on! Let's go face the enemy! Captain, what about another drink? Captain? Captain! Here, I came out better off! You're wasting your time, honey. The captain doesn't like you. - But you found a friend, now! - It was about time I did! - But what's wrong with the captain? - The captain? He wanted to marry a whore. And she immediately dumped him for a certain Raffaello from Siena. The captain is a jerk. I feel sorry for this Sienese if he meets him. This idiot didn't run, he's still living in the dukedom! What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? I washed myself a week ago! Why doesn't the captain look for him? Because the baron would hang him, if he left his post. More wine? I'll bring you some immediately! Are you coming from Siena? Yes, he's Sienese! You come from Siena! - Bandit! - He comes from Siena! But what are you talking about? I'm not Sienese! I'll show you! - Yes, that's it! - You come from Siena! - But I'm an orphan! - Don't deny it! You come from Siena! You're damn right! From Siena! - From Siena? - A coward from Siena ruined her! He kidnapped her. He made her his lover. And when she gave birth to twins, he left her without money. And the twin girls died of hunger. He came from Siena! - Was he tall? - Yes, tall. - With a wide nose? - Wide. - With - Gray? gray eye? - And the other one brown? - Brown. - And his name was Raf... - Raffaello! He lives in the dukedom. - I'll give you a pass. - And we'll take revenge! Your revenge will be mine! That's a deal! Well decided and well said! As a true soldier, as a man of honor! You'll need it to go out. Women and soldiers: free entry! "From 1 to 15 September, "the Virgin Festival will be organized by the Baron y Moira." By order of the baron, we'll gather this year's virgins declared fit for service. Old women, step out of line! Only virgins in the line. Move forward! Come on! Move two by two. Stick out your chests, pull your stomachs in! Keep up! One, two! One, two! One, two! Forward! Where do they bring you? Are you going to a party? - Walk. - The party? We'll be the attraction. My Francesca! My daughter! Come on, climb in, hurry! The baron is waiting. "Concettina Lo Cascio. Age: 16. "Fit for service and enlisted." Walk! My daughter! Promise me one thing! What, mamma? That you won't enjoy it! "Immacolata Esposito. Age: 18. "Fit and enlisted." Present! We are celebrating the Virgin Festival! Not the witch congress! Where is the girl? Immacolata called in sick. I replace her. Arrest her! - 3O years in prison! - But I'll be old when I go out! Don't worry, you'll receive your pension! No, let her go! I'm lmmacolata. Did someone ask her something? Noble lord, have mercy on her! She's a little silly, and... And even nymphomaniac. Take the girl and get rid of the old one. May God protects us from her! I'll go by myself! But you're not lmmacolata. Everybody minds their own business. Let's go! Don't enjoy it, it's a sin! Tell them to be careful! You know you're fragile! Why are you laughing? Has your daughter already known disgrace? She sure is a virgin. But I pity the one who'll have her. He will be surprised! - Like with an Easter egg! - Worse! The hunt is on! - Baron. - Don Carlos. I hope this will be new for you. It is, dear don Carlos, a new kind of hunt, very interesting. I'm sure of it, dear Baron. I can't wait to start. The Spanish court is a little conformist when it comes to entertainment, but some novelty can't do no harm. It's only a modest attempt at alleviating the boredom of the provincial life. All from the latest year group, right? What about going to check these darlings? It seems to me that it's a good year. - Choose yours. - After you, dear Baron. The baron is meticulous. He wants the right height. Your turn, don Carlos. Bravo, don Carlos. That's a choice that proves your experience. A woman who has everything. And even more. He'll understand it soon and will be quite surprised! Gentlemen, choose your preys. Mamma told me to tell you I'm fragile. Hey! You don't look fragile! Make the dogs sniff the veil of your prey. They will help you. Don't run too much: my dog has a cold. You will have no difficulty catching your preys. Anyway, for the ones who have legs weaker than the rest... or too short, I did prepare a special potion to revive you. And another one, to make the virgins less fast without dazing them. That's ready. I'll make sure the run doesn't tire you too much. That's perfect, just perfect. What a bargain! Sex and drug. For the virgins and for the gentlemen. To the virgins! To the virgins! To the virgins! To the new order! Cheers! I don't need it. Gentlemen! Saddle up! May the potion revive you... for what's waiting for you! Let's hunt them down! - This way! - That way, fast! Soon, you'll thank me! Don Carlos! Come on, take me! I have a surprise for you! What surprise? The usual thing is enough for me! - Wait for me! - You must catch me! - I am a pheasant, not a hen! - Wait! But I like hens! Well? This way, my lord! This way! Come on, hurry up! I don't want to be frustrated! We're almost there, my lord. What do you want from me, again? Usurping my rights wasn't enough for you? What rights are you talking about? Peasant! I'm not a peasant! My blood is nobler than yours. It's the legitimate blood of the duke of Valle Stretta ! Well, here's another one who aspires to my throne. Who else aspires to my rights? Another crazy man like you that I'll hang! So I might be crazy? What do you say about that? I have to thank you. For that... and for your life! You're the dumbest baron I ever met! An eye for an eye and a tooth for... You are a lucky idiot! After running so much, you need a good bath, if you want to attract men. Wake up! A real gentleman never disappoints a woman! Oh, stop it, please. Given my condition, we can postpone it until... Christmas. - Are you a virgin, young man? - From where, my lord? Wait for me, little redhead! Show me your surprise! What a potion! The one who caught me was in such a condition that he ended up forgetting what he wanted from me! Take comfort, girls! This will be the only flowers picked up today! - These are chamomile flowers. - Or maybe poppies! - Finally! - Well, that surprise? You like it? Surprised? How did it go, girls? Nothing serious happened? No. Unfortunately. Good bye! Tell our mothers we joined Zenabel's army! Let's just hope it won't be only women! Two doses of salamander oil... - We all worry for Zenabel. - concentrated extract of toad liver. Do you have news? Let's add some pepper. Don't go too far with it, I have an upset stomach. But we need it! If I don't heal, I'll put you in it too! Zenabel doesn't come back and you only think about yourself! - Here we are! We're coming! - Zenabel! Zenabel! Zenabel, Zenabel! You came back! That's enough, we don't have time to lose. We must leave before the baron comes back to pick up his game. Somebody knows the place where we could find shelter? In the mountains! Let's join the Rebel! - Yes! - Yes, the Rebel! Forward, haPPY inventive women, Woe betide the ones who'll stop us Where are you going? And you, who are you? - We come to seek protection... - And help from the Rebel. No, we don't seek anything: we offer an alliance. And here is my army. This, an army? And I, I am Alexander the Great! You're a fool! Take me to your chief! I'll take you right now. Be ready for a warm welcome. But don't go complaining about it! - Friends, here's an army of virgins! - Wake up! Here are some powerful allies! Stop complaining! Look what's coming: - comforting victuals! - Wonderful! Let's eat them right now! Where is this famous Rebel? Here he is, Madame. He's the one sleeping. Don't you find him beautiful? They are hungrier than us! You again? Gennaro. Also known as the Rebel. At your service. Rebel? Bandit! Brigand! How do you make the revolution? By sleeping? Rascal! Anyway, I'll teach you how to behave like a real man. Me too! If we join forces, we might be able to dethrone the baron! Maybe. Sometimes, the crazy people are right. Don't worry, Gennaro. Thanks to my magical arts, the world will tremble before the wings of freedom! We'll fight our battle alone! And I will guide you! Come on! That's good! Like that! Prime, seconde, tierce, quarte! Prime, seconde! Come on! Like that, that's it! Raise your wrist, come on! Prime, seconde, tierce, quarte! Show me your ferocity, Carmela! The blade, downwards! Good! Prime, seconde, tierce, quarte! Prime, seconde, tierce, quarte! Prime, seconde! Can you see what's happening to you? You want to skewer me, Pancrazio? I'll tell you later. No, tell me right now! Move! En garde! Where are you going, Mimma? Come back right now! Always going out and about! Sooner or later, you'll end up having trouble! Don't be upset, Mimma. I know you're an honest pigeon! Lia! That's not like that! Look. Look at what I do! Put your leg like that and hit with the edge! Here! Try, too! One, two, three! One, two, three! Careful, Zenabel! You leave the main target defenseless! - Hey, you ! - What? Wake up, for the last time! I'm tired of your pigs! I hold you responsible for it! Defend yourself, then! The winner will take the lead. Alright? Even if I won, I would not lead your pigs! And now? You understand it's not a woman thing? Charge on! Gennaro, this time, it's too much, even for you! Have you seen this determination? What do you say? We don't fear anybody! If only we had weapons and money! Look, let's talk... General to general. Have you ever thought of getting your supplies at the baron's? Three, four and five. Next! - Hurry up! - Right now, my lord. Come on! Next! - That's all I have. - No joke, where is the rest? I want some justice! - Give it to him. - In prison! Both of them! Who released the horses? The money disappeared! There's nothing left! Impossible! My horses are honest! - Hey! That was her! - That was her! - Catch her! - Fast! Forward! At a gallop! First of all, here is the money! - Are the others still in position? - Yes, Zenabel. They only wait for us to act. While the Spanish will be looking for us here, we'll go there! Follow me without fear, victory is ours! Excuse-me... What are you looking at? ARSENAL It's done! CELLAR The Spanish ministers and envoys wait in the anteroom. I'm not in the mood for it. Damn her! Zenabel always manages to get me! She ruined my virgin festival. And the ministers let her Iaught at me. I'll start my day with a lesson to the minister of the armed forces... and to someone else! Unless they come up with a good idea! - Do you have a good idea to suggest? - We thought over this quite a long time. Our idea is to hand in our resignations. - Did you hear? - They even thought about it! Resignations accepted! Forward, happy... inventive women... What are you complaining about? Sometimes, even a general would like to feel like a woman. What a beautiful woman you are! Zenabel! Zenabel! Everybody's waiting for you! Don't answer, stay with me. I can't, it's a party in my honor. - Zenabel! - I'm here! Ah, I found you! Have fun at your party! Did something happen? No. Nothing happened. Let's go! I'm coming! - Well, come on. - I'm on duty! I can't dance! Let me go! Pancrazio, I'm sure you were beautiful! 30 guards of the baron with a single hand! I have to admit that not all the credit goes to me in this... this glorious victory! No, no! Everybody has its own merit! I think some of the credit goes to the ones who looked after the horses... while I was fighting side by side with Zenabel, there! You're sure there wasn't anybody else, Pancrazio? Let's not go too far. I don't say I was completely alone. But, without doubt, the weight of my strenght was acutely felt. The cut throats of the duke were able to see what Pancrazio is capable of. And if that wasn't enough, I'm completely ready to do it again! Do you remember your oath, Pancrazio ? A toast! Let's drink to the victory and to our general! Thanks, Zazé! At least, you give us credit. And now, have fun! Come on! Show us! Come on! Yes! Come on, let's dance! What's the matter with Gennaro ? He doesn't drink with us? Cheers! Gennaro only drinks when he's thirsty. And only what he wants! How come a man like you can be happy with a supporting role? Indeed. I often asked myself this question. - One day... - Why not tonight? Tonight, I have better things to do. - But what are they doing? - Here's what happens when two cocks are in the same henhouse. Help! Help me! - If you knew! God help us! - What happened? What happened? The baron arrested children and fathers of the girls who are with you. If you don't surrender, he'll hang them before dawn. I'll handle this. Wait, Zenabel. Wait, I'm coming with you! It's a man's job! - What happened? - I don't know. Shall we go? - Where has Zenabel gone? - Your sister? My sister? She left for a desperate mission, after seeing the seal you wear around your neck. - Doesn't it ring a bell, my dear Duke? - Zazé! All these people might die because they believed in rne. In me who almost forgot my oath! And for who? For my brother! Murderer! This pathway is not well known. I'll take them by surprise! I'll take the back entrance, that is not guarded. It will be easy to cross the courtyard. That's it! Then I'll enter in the main courtyard and take the guards by surprise. And then, the private apartments. I took everybody by surprise! I was right, wasn't I? It's not that easy to fool the baron! And the best part is that it didn't cost us an effort. And now, the baron will torture her during hours, before killing her. Now, you have no more way out. Be ready to get tortured. Torture will be sweet, if it comes from a man like you. You won't get away with flattery. Some burning pincers, that's all? You disappoint me, baron. I was expecting some creative effort from you. What do you want to do with this antique? There's still an art that I... master. Whether you're a master or not in this area, I'll decide. What do you know about it? You're still a virgin. On the other hand, I have a good theoretical culture. If you like this kind of torture, I'll torture you until it drives you crazy! I just want you to enjoy me like you enjoyed my father's throne. Your father is dead. And you'll soon be dead. The witch is ready for the stake my lord. Proceed! We all must confess our sins. And to show you the example, I myself am ready to confess mine, too. I stole this seal. If you want salvation, confess them too. Confess that you love me. Even there, you don't leave me alone! Is that how you repent? For the last time, confess that you love me. - No! No! No! - You stubborn witch! I'll save you anyway! Guards! Death to the Spanish! Catch this! What's the hell happening, captain? Restore order immediately or I'll have your head cut off! - I got this, my lord! - Are you laughing at me? Forgive me, my lord! Guards! Guards! To the palace! Call for backup! Let's hang everybody! Follow me! Come on, let's follow him! To the palace! Zenabefl Rebels! Follow me! Rebels! This way! Stop! Rebels! This way! Stop! Rebels! Let's got that way! Stop! Rebels! And now, which way do we go? Stop them! To the castle! Come on, friends! - We have a saint protecting us! - Here he is! That's Cecco! - Cecco and his pigeons! - What? Yes! The pigeons were his secret weapon! Let's go! Hy, pigeon! No! This way! And now, you go to the left, and you go to the right! Make no mistake! He's running! But... For the baron, with our best regards! - Long live our duchess! - Hooray! Choose your preys, and good hunting! Cute! No. No, leave rne alone! - Go! - No, don't go! I chose you! Give me that veil, right now! Ready? The hunting is about to start! Wait! No, no! No! Not the dog! He bites! But I love you! I love you! Scram! Move! Move! I came to return this to the real duke of Valle Stretta. But what is he doing? Your brother. Well, yes. My mother was your nanny. Good bye. What are you going to do, now? Go back to the mountains. Here, I don't like anything. There are times where a witty woman must learn to swallow her pride. Wait! Wait! No, you, wait! Put me down! That's unfair! I am the hunter, today! Put me down, please! Please, put me down! - No! - I'll put you down, now. - Let me go! Bad boy! - Well, go to hell! Today, I am the hunter, I told you! Wait for me! Stop it, Zenabel! That wasn't true! There's still one thing that I like! That's you! Stop! Zenabel! Stop! Wait for me! Zenabel!
