(CAMERA CLICKING) (INAUDIBLE) You're going to work today? -What? -You're going to work again today? You ask me that every day! I'm not telling. What do you think? I'm just gonna ask you every day. You ask me that every day, and every day I give you the same answer. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh! -You been studying? -Have I been studying? Yes, I've been studying. So hard. -I've been studying so hard... -How hard? How hard? Oh, every day. For hours and hours and hours. Really, I swear. -Fine? Okay, do me. -Okay. (BOTH LAUGHING) Get upstairs! Now! You'll be late. Go on, go on, go on! School! Get going! "Name the differences in market value, assessed value, "insurance value and liquidation value." -I haven't read that part yet. -Sounds important. And I thought selling an estate was gonna be fun. Boy, was I wrong! All you got to know about mainly is, like, points and escrow and stuff like that. Oh, is that all? I am not ready to take this exam. You'll be fine. Besides, real estate's better work. Working in a nightclub is lousy work. You're never home. So, now I have to be a real estate agent in sensible shoes. There's good money in real estate. There's good money in dancing. Here's one for ya. Two definitions of valued designations. Um... Oh, Mark, will you give me a break? I promise I will study and I'll try to pass this exam. But just don't forget, it's only in case my career goes sour. I mean, I think I need to be a dancer, remember? You gotta get down on your agent. Tell her you want more jobs in the day time. Jill got me a dance interview today. But if I get it, it's night work again. At least what I have now is steady work and it's good money. Come on, come on. Bus time, let's go. Hurry up. Put that book down. Let's go. Mark... I'm sorry I'm not like every other mother. That's not what I'm talking about. (SIGHS) I know. I know I'm not home enough. That's what I'm talking about. Oh, Mark, I love you! I promise it won't be like this all the time, okay? Hope not. It won't. Here... Milk or juice. No soda. And give me the bubblegum. -What bubblegum? -I know you got it. Give it to me right now. And don't give Ruthie a tough time tonight. And, please get some sleep. A little sleep tonight. -Okay. Definitely maybe. -Oh... So long, Mom. Have a good day. I love you! (CLICKING) (DIAL TONE HUMMING) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) WOMAN: Good. Good. Do some stretching, we're gonna do an adagio next. What's the problem, Susie? Oh... My arabesque still seems a little shaky. Oh, I think you're being too hard on yourself. Just keep working. You're doing very well. Okay? Oh, um... I have a favor to ask of you. Uh... I have a really important audition today and... Oh! I was wondering if I could leave a little early. -All right, you can go. You're done. -Thank you. All right, children, let's go. All right. -Susie... -What? The audition's been called off. -(SIGHS) Oh! -Too bad, huh? I thought you said there were a lot of jobs for dancers in this town. There'll be other auditions. Yeah, call for six and 60 show up. Could I borrow a dime? What! You know all the tricks, don't you? Your job pays well, doesn't it? Yeah. I'm just trying to find something else, you know. -(PHONE RINGING) -Lori... WOMAN: Good morning. -Hi. Hi, Jill. It's Susie Hanson. -Hi, Susie. Um, anything today? Not so far. Call me later, though. Okay, well, you know I'm up for grabs, I'll... I'll do anything. I'll be a bowler or a ballerina. (LAUGHS) Just make sure to keep in touch. -I have a lot of calls now. -Thanks. -Okay? -Okay. -Bye. -Bye. (SIGHS IN DISAPPOINTMENT) Temple, Benjamin. Watch that back, Sandra. Head up. -Hey! Mr. Parkins! -Hey, Ruthie, how's school? Oh. Okay. Hey, you gotta give me another joke. All right. Real quick one. Why does an elephant have wrinkles? I don't know. Why does an elephant have wrinkles? You ever tried to iron one? Come on. -(LAUGHING) -I don't. Susie! -Oh, hi. Perfect timing. -Come on, we're late. -Come on, babe. -Okay. Listen, um... This check is for Mr. Andretti, it's the rent. He'll be by this evening to get it. Uh, food's in the fridge. And Mark should be home by 4:00. -Okay, you got it. -Great. Susie, if we're late one more time, neither one of us will ever get a paycheck. Okay, okay! Now don't forget Mr. Andretti. And please see that Mark gets just a little sleep. A little. -Okay, you got it. Don't worry. (LAUGHS) -Bye. PARKINS: I don't know, Susie. You and your money problems. Nobody said you had to live at the beach! Oh, yeah. With Mark's allergies, we gotta live at the beach. He needs fresh air. Then you're spending all that extra money for Mark's fancy schooling. I know. I know. It does add up. Why don't you put Mark in public school? Until things ease up. You have to cut down somewhere along the line. You have to put some money aside for a rainy day. Ah, come on. I heard it never rains in Southern California. Yeah, that's what some people say, but I know differently. What's the matter, sir? Did the waitress say something you didn't like, huh? I mean, the show's gonna start in five minutes. I'll see you later in the week, right? Hi, hi, come on in. We've got a first-time-ever afternoon show. Watch your step. Gentlemen, good you're playing this afternoon. We're gonna be so bad tonight. -I got a beautiful spot for you right over here. -Smile for the camera. Right over here. Perfect view of the action. Back there. Oh, sure, absolutely. Come on, right back here. Beautiful table. Can't miss anything up on the... Oh, yes, exactly. That's always where I sit myself. How about a drink? Vodka on the rocks. You got it. Show's gonna start in a few minutes. You sit back, enjoy yourself. (DRUMROLL) (APPLAUSE) Welcome! Welcome to the wonderful, fabulous Club Versailles. The only and one last stronghold left of all burlesque in all of Southern California. -(CROWD WHOOPING) -Young lady, -I see you've been at the beach. -Yeah. -And a lobster bit one of my toes. -Really? Which one? I don't know. I can't tell one lobster from the other. (LAUGHING) All right, all right, all right. Without any further ado, -or without any further a-don't... -(DRUMROLL) Let me introduce our opening act. The voluptuous, the vivacious, Veronica! -(CROWD APPLAUDING AND WHISTLING) -(SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWD WHISTLING) (CAMERA CLICKING) (CAMERA CLICKING) -(SONG ENDS) -(APPLAUDING) Terrific, terrific, terrific! Oh, what a girl! What a girl! You should see my girl. I went to pick her up the other night, and she came down the stairs snapping and barking at automobile tires. -(CROWD LAUGHING) -She insisted that I take the top down on my car. It wasn't even a convertible! Now, let me introduce the next dancing artist, the lovely, the delectable, Donna! -(APPLAUSE) -(CARIBBEAN MUSIC PLAYING) -(DIAL TONE BEEPING) -I must drop half my salary at this payphone! I swear, Ruthie must have been born with a telephone in her ear! Don't panic, just call 'em later. Well, he was telling me the teacher's down on him and he kept falling asleep in class. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. I slept all the way through high school. -Oh, look at you now. -Oh! (LAUGHING) How is the little fellow? Oh, I think he's fine. I hope. It's just, with me working at nights, I don't get to see him much. And then he waits up for me and he doesn't get much sleep. Ugh! Well, If you really wanna see him more, why don't you invite him to the club? I mean, I think he'd like it. I wanna see more of him, I don't want him to see more of me. Oh, come on, I mean, making him think you work at an elegant nightclub is better? -(GRUNTS) -Absolutely. Well, if I remember correctly, mothers lying to their little kids isn't good. It warps their personality. Well, I was hoping to get a job dancing, so I wouldn't have to tell him anything at all. Oh, come on! Level with him, you know. You're not doing anything wrong. (DIAL TONE BEEPING) You're talking about a kid whose big dream is to have his mom sell real estate! -Real estate? -(SIGHS) I used to know a guy who worked in real estate who sold cemetery plots. (GIRLS MOCKING) Susie, I caught you out front, you were terrific! Yeah? Great! -But... -Oh, "but". With you there's always a "but". What do you think I'm here for, girl? I am here to teach you ladies to go bumping the night. And, Susie, you still bump when you should grind. I'm working on it. I swear I am. And, another thing, and this goes for all of you, you guys, you've gotta work on top of the beat. It'll help you work big. -And one, and two... -(CHEERING) Oh, man! Burlesque is the art of exaggeration. And for the 100th time, pick out somebody in the audience and make eye contact! -I did! -And when you do, let him have it all. Virginia Ding-dong-bell taught me that. Didn't you say how you knew everyone in burlesque? And everybody knew us. When I was working as Crystal Fever, -the boys used to be lined up around the block. -I bet. -I was very big in Toledo. -(LAUGHING) I was big all out the Midwest. -Sally, you was big, huh? -Yeah, in the rear! (LAUGHING) That's better than you anywhere. Listen, if I put my mind to it and ate nothing but cottage cheese for a couple of weeks, -I could still knock them out of their socks! -PARKINS: My girl... Have you been thinking about going back? Oh, I was really tickled when Mel called me to help out with you kids. -But I am so happy in Detroit... -On a chicken farm? Listen, those chickens do not treat you wrong like some guys I know. -Chickens! -What, what, what? -Get on stage! -Chickens! Chickens! What do they do, henhouse? What do they do? What do they do? (WHOOPING) And don't lay any eggs! Oh! -(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) -(APPLAUSE) "Does not meet our needs at the present time." (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It's open. -Say, hey, Frankie! -Hey, Randy! What have you got for me? I'm married to this broad for three years, she never ceases to amaze me. -The idiot she goes with. -Yeah. You're too much. What was that? Uh, $300? $400, Randy. $200 now, $200 when I get the rest of the photos. How did you get these shots? Looks like you were in there with them. Goodbye, Randy. Later. (DOOR CLOSING) (PHONE RINGING) -Hello. -Mr. Sterling? Yeah, this is Sterling. This is Frank Andrews. Oh! I expected to hear from you several days ago. Yeah, well, this work takes time. Well, what did you find out? She's living in an apartment in Venice. Just she and her kid. The kid is enrolled in some sort of a special school for very smart children. Oh, yeah. My grandson's a smart one. And, unfortunately for you, Mr. Sterling, she seems to lead a very clean personal life. It took you two weeks and $800 to find that out? Well, I have found something, Mr. Sterling. Your daughter-in-law is a stripper. Come again? She dances burlesque. Four times a night at a strip club. I want photographs, Frank. Well, I'm arranging for that. I've also wired her place for sound. Good. I knew I could count on you. I'm gonna challenge her for custody of the child, Frank. Well, you know I'll do what I can, but she's a dancer, Mr. Sterling, not a hooker. Find me proof she's morally unfit. -I'll make it worth your while. -Yeah. I'll call you later. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And that concludes our show for this evening. Now, please... Oh, that's nice, Charlie, thanks. Can I have some glasses, please? PARKINS: ...in the afternoon, so, please drop by and see us. Goodnight, Charlie. PARKINS: Nice. Nice crowd, great show. We must have 30 or 40 people here tonight. Still didn't learn how to count, did you, Harry? There were 22. You know, if we keep this up, we're gonna be packing them in every night. Pretty soon, all those customers who have been going to the porno houses and all the topless joints, they're gonna be coming back here. -Harry, you were always a dreamer, you know that? -Hmm. Did you see the way Sally was working the girls tonight? Harry, what difference does it make? We took in $257 tonight. -257 bucks, that's not bad. (LAUGHS) -"Not bad." It doesn't even help me pay the band. Well, don't pay the band right away. They can wait. They've waited before. Harry, let me tell you something. You and Sally had a wonderful idea, we were gonna have an afternoon show here, we tried it out, it didn't work. What do you mean it didn't work? You didn't give it a chance. I don't have time to give it a chance, Harry. This place is eating me alive. (INDISTINCT LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION) Okay, let's get serious, troops. We gotta do this boogie right. I can't believe what I look like now. Okay, the sooner we get it, the sooner we get out of here. Line, right, right. And, a-one, a-two, a-three... But Sally came all the way from Detroit. You said she's gonna work with the girls, right? -A-one, a-two... -(PARKINS ARGUING LOUDLY) MEL: Harry, I... PARKINS: You don't want the girls to hear. -Why don't you tell them! -Oh, Harry, you're making a scene. Don't walk away from me. Don't walk away from me, you! I want an explanation! -I wanted to tell the... -Tell the girls what, Mel? Yeah, yeah. Tell the girls what, Mel? Go on, tell the girls! Tell them that you sold the club to these guys from Chicago. -Mel! When? -Last night. I mean, what am I gonna do otherwise? I've gotta shut the doors for good. Mel, you promised us a chance to make this show work. I came all the way here from Detroit to work with these girls! -I know you did, Sally... -Who'd you sell the club to, huh? -The Lollipop chain. -Ugh! But they promised me nothing's gonna change. Oh, "nothing's gonna change." Mel, you weren't born yesterday. You know what those girls have to do in those clubs! Only thing worse than those clubs are carnival strippers. Now that is the pits! Please try to understand me, will you, Sally? I mean, I can't even pay the rent on this place anymore! Nobody cares about a clean act like at the Versailles. -Your jokes are going over like lead balloons. -The jokes are... And nobody cares about dancers. They wanna see bodies... Bodies, Mel? We show them bodies. You know they don't wanna see bodies. -They wanna see... -But I can't fight it anymore! Mel, you said we would never have to work strong. The club's not mine. How about these guys from Chicago? Are they gonna keep us all on? They promised they're gonna take a good look at everybody. (LAUGHS) Yeah, they'll take a good look. I'm leaving. Sally, no, please don't do that. No, stick around. Now, maybe the new owners, they'll like the new show. Yeah, and maybe it'll snow in July. That's not fair, Sally. What else could I do? It's times like this that a girl could use a little champagne, you know. Everybody, please, come on. It's on the house. Right, lasted the really big spenders. Sally, I wasn't trying to sell you out. -SUSIE: What are we gonna do? -I don't know. Maybe it'll all work out. Look, I'm gonna call you later. Um, I gotta get home to Mark. -Bye, bye. -Uh, Susie? Later. (SIGHS) Ruthie. Ruthie? It's time to go. -Everything okay? -Yeah. It went great. -Ah... Thanks. Okay. -Yeah. -Good night. (LAUGHS) -You were awake? -Well, sort of awake. -It's a good thing you live downstairs. -Bye, bye. Good night. -Good night. -Hi, Mom. -Hi. Well, at least you got some sleep. What's wrong? Nothing. Ah, just stuff at work. Anything I can help with? No. No. The fact that you noticed is enough. I'm here. I've got all night. (LAUGHS) Oh, no, you don't. It's time to go to bed. Come on. It's bedtime. Let's go. Give me a kiss. Come on. Come on. Good night. MARK: Hi, Mom. SUSIE: Hi. Well, at least you got some sleep. MARK: What's wrong? SUSIE: Um, nothing. Just stuff at work. MARK: Anything I can help with? SUSIE: No. The fact that you noticed is enough. MARK: I'm here. I got all night. SUSIE: (CHUCKLES) No, you don't. It's time to go to bed. Come on. -Good night, Mom. -Good night. Okay, let's take it from the top. Let's have everyone and then we'll do it in two groups. And if I select, you give your name over on the left. All right. Places. One, two, three, four. -(PIANO PLAYING) -One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Okay, first group. From the top. A little brighter, Arthur. One, two, three, four. -(PIANO PLAYING) -One, two, three, four. (CLAPPING) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One! Good. Have you stay. You stay. Rest, thank you. Group number two. (CLAPPING) All right, come on. That was good tempo. Again. -One, two, three, four. -(PIANO PLAYING) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One! Okay. Have you stay. You stay. The rest, thank you. All right, all those selected, let's take it from the top again. (CLAPPING) Come on. And, one, two, three, four. -(PIANO PLAYING) -One, two, three, four. Three, four. (CLAPPING) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. (TV ANNOUNCER TALKING INDISTINCTLY) -(MARK COUGHING) -Hey. Hey, Mark, do me a favor and get a glass of water, all right? Already had some. Well, then, get a cough drop, all right? We don't have any. Well, check your mom's room. All right, let's see what the new club has to offer. -Oh, look at this, look at this. -God! They don't believe in wasting time. They just go ahead and change the sign. Oh, the Lollipop club! No! I'm not going. I'm not going! -Just a little bit, come on. -No, I can't do it. We'll bowl them over, let's go. Come on, come on. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) -(WHISTLING) -PARKINS: Look at the size of that ramp! Wow! They must be loaded! (CHEERING) Hey, hey, hey, hey! Will you lighten up? Come on. We talked about this in the car. Come on. Listen, you go get dressed. I'll try and find the new boss. (CHEERING AND WHOOPING) -Boo! (LAUGHS) -(EXHALES) -This is so strange. -Yeah. It's not my style. Just so you should know, I quit. I really quit. They don't need me around here anymore. I just stayed to say goodbye to you. Oh... Promise I'll work again. Yeah. And eat lots of chicken. (CHEERING AND WHISTLING) -(EXHALES) -Welcome to the combat zone. -It's so weird out there. -There's more surprises. -What do you mean? -You better hurry up the change. They're walking in here without checking. Those creeps think they own the joint. -They do! (LAUGHS) -I'm not kidding. Come on. -Hurry up! -What's the matter? -Okay, you'll see. -What are you doing? Girls, uh, girls... And that's Jackie, and... Uh, this is Susie, the youngest of our little angels. This is Mr. Vector. He's your new boss. You're a little on the skinny side, but I guess you'll do. Susie's a great dancer. I mean, she picks up the classic routines fast. Yeah... Girls, uh, it's aloha time. -Jackie. -Mel. (LAUGHS) -I'm gonna miss your smiling face. -Oh... You take care of yourself. -(SIGHS) -Oh, Susie. This is for your boy. Gee! Oh... Now, I'm really sorry that things didn't work out. -But you remember, we gave it a hell of a time? -We sure did. Where are you headed, Melski? Oh, I'm going to Miami by way of Vegas. Why don't you just skip Vegas and hold on to the money they gave you? -I'm going a couple of days this time. -That's all it takes. (LAUGHS) What a jerk! (EXHALES) I think Mel's kind of a nice guy. Yeah, he might be. The trouble is nice guys finish last in this business. Who finishes first, Mr. Vector? I do. (SCOFFS) Hey, Susie. Come on, look at you. You wear this relic to this Star-House Ballroom? -(SCOFFS) Wait a minute... -What is that, like a confirmation costume? Come on, eighty-six that. I'll take care of it for you. Jackie, take a walk. Go get acquainted with the customers. -(DOOR CLOSING) -Excuse me. Hey, now, there's gonna be a lot of changes, all right? Whoa, sugar, whoa, whoa, whoa! You know something, you were terrific out there. You were a knock out. But you're not done. Yeah, hey! I'm not kidding. Remember I told you, first on the stage, and you go out there and you meet the customers. -All right? Okay. -Okay. Go on, go on. You see? Lot of change, eh? I thought we had a really great show, Mr. Vector. Mr. Vector? Hey, come on. Call me Steve, all right? -Steve. -Nice. Nice. So, you think you... Think you had a good show, huh? Come on, you got some old geezer out there telling tired elephant jokes. You got some pretty girls, but that's kids' stuff, you know. High school time. I'm gonna be looking for something a little different. Come here. Come here, come on! -(DOOR OPENING) -(CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY) (CROWD WHISTLING) Look. That's Wendy. That's Bonnie. (LAUGHS) And that's Tracy. Those three really know the score. (LAUGHS) Hey, you can do that. (CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING) Here. You get dressed, all right? I'll give you a little privacy. All right? Then you go out there. It's gonna be okay. I promise you. Susie... Knock 'em out, hmm? (CHEERING AND WHOOPING) -Listen... -(GASPS) No, no. Go back! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me. Take it easy. Have a drink on me. John. Now, you listen. I didn't like you when I first met you, and I like you even less now. You watch your step real close, kiddo. Or you're gonna find yourself bouncing down those front stairs on an empty wallet. (SNIFFLING) (CROWD WHISTLING) Let go of me! -PARKINS: Hey! Susie! Susie! -What... I tried to stop him, but he slipped right out of my hand. Here, take my coat. Hey, tubbo, what the hell is going on here? Oh, Mr. Vector, uh, Susie, she felt a little faint, so she thought she'd better get some night air. In the middle of her act she wants night air? No, no, no, she said she'd be back in time for the next act. Oh, boy, you've got some club in there. It's really hopping. -That is one wacky broad! -Yeah. -All right, let's go. -All right. -Let's go! -Yeah, all right. Mark. Oh, Mark... Oh... Oh, Mark! Mark... Mark! (PANTING) Mark? Mark! Mark! Mark! (SOBBING) (MARK COUGHING) Mark... Stay where you are. Mark. About the club... About my job... -I was gonna tell you. -I don't believe you. I was! Really! I wouldn't lie to you. You lied about the club. I lied to you. And I'm sorry. You never lied to me before. At least I don't think you did. I never lied to you before. And I never will again. Sure. How did you get down here? Mark, if I find out that you were hitchhiking... If I find... -(TIRES SCREECHING) -Mark! Mark! (COUGHING) That was a really stupid thing to do! You could've gotten yourself hurt! Yeah, like you care! Will you stop! Stop. Look at yourself. You make me sick! I said that's enough. That is enough, I want you to stop. How can you work in a place like that? It's so crummy! Because we need the money! Because I wanna keep the apartment at the beach! Because your school is expensive! Hey, I didn't ask for that apartment or no private school! I want you to make something special of your life! Like you have? Mark. Mark! Mark, come back here! (SIGHS) (MARK CRYING) (COUGHING) Mom, would just please leave me alone? Please? (SNIFFLING) I wanna go home. I guess I don't care if you dance at the club. But, Mom, you didn't mean to lie to me, did you? Oh... I love you. Oh, Mark was so upset last night. I'm gonna quit. How much did you pay for these groceries? -$58. -Then you can't afford it. I know I can't afford to, but how am I going to... Susie, you're alone. You've got a kid. That's a big responsibility. You have no other choice. Hell, you can always quit! Just string Vector along. -(SIGHS) -And keep your back to the wall. Come on. Oh, well... At least you'll be there. No, no, I won't. Vector gave me my walking papers last night. You're kidding! No, I just don't fit his image. He thinks I would be better off as a doorman at Disneyland. (PHONE RINGING) -Yeah? -Frank. It's Walt Sterling, I've been trying to reach you. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Sterling, I had some prints in the soup. Look, Frank, these photographs you sent me are no good. There's nothing compromising in them. I can't make my case with these. -Frank! -Huh? What? I can't make my case with this stuff! Oh, yeah, well, Mr. Sterling, I think... I think we're in luck. The, uh... The club where she works has changed owners, and they have this new policy. It's a real dump now. The girls have to dance nude. They're totally naked. I think I'll be able to get the photographs we need tonight. Frank, I'm beginning to be weary of your eternal promises of something hot. It's been three weeks. You still haven't sent me anything I can use! I'm disappointed, Frank. You came highly recommended. Did you hear me? I'm very disappointed! Yes, I heard you. I'm a photographer. I'm not a house detective. Oh, you're getting paid. Get me what I want. (DIAL TONE HUMMING) I hate the fact that you're talking to that man. Don't worry. Frank will get me what I need. Well, don't fight Susie for Mark. Why don't you just call her and try and reach an understanding? She won't talk to me. She didn't even leave a forwarding address when she took off. Well, can you blame her? One evening she tells us she's thinking of moving, and the very next day you're at your lawyer's, making threats to Susan. -I want custody of the boy. -Oh! Susan is a good mother to Mark. No Judge in his right mind would give you custody. Yeah, well, let's just wait and see what Frank comes up with. What, nude pictures of her? Do you think anybody really cares? Regret the day she ever came into this family. So, I rather imagine, does she. Hey, whose side are you on? Well, there are no sides! Remember, Susan was very good for our Billy. (GRUNTING) I always felt she was partly responsible for that accident. Susan is the reason Billy stayed alive as long as he did! He was hell-bound to destruction long before he married her. I... I thank the good Lord every day that he didn't take Susan and Mark with him. I'll never forgive myself. Or you for failing him. Well, it's a mistake we're not gonna make with Mark. Don't you see that, Edith? That's why I want him here with us. To care for him. Away from Susan's influence. Oh, Walt... You are... You are forcing our grandson to make a choice. A very big choice. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEERING AND WHISTLING) What do you mean taking off like that last night? Don't pull that again, ever. I'm sorry. Look, I like you. -Work with me. -(SIGHS) A few days. I'll take you out of here. I'll set you up. You and the kid. It won't happen again. All right. -You're on next. You all set? -Right. Okay. (CHEERING AND WHISTLING CONTINUES) (APPLAUDING AND WHISTLING) You were great. You were beautiful. A little more smile next time. Now, I want you to meet a friend of mine. All right? Roy? I quit! (INDISTINCT RADIO ANNOUNCEMENT) -Hey, watch it! -Ow! Ow! (SNIFFLING) Here. -Thanks. Stupid litter box! -Yeah. Guess I must have looked pretty dumb out there. You were looking pretty good there for a minute. 180s are my big problem. Yeah. You know, you ought to wear a helmet and pads, so you wouldn't get cut up. -Next time. -Mmm-hmm. -Can you make it to the water over there? -Yeah, I'm fine. -All right. Sure. -(WINCING) Ouch! -You live around here? -No. What do you do, anyway? I'm a photographer. Say, can we borrow your water a minute? -Let me see that. -Ah... You know, we just studied photography in school. And now we're moving to solar energy. Solar energy, huh? Thank you. -Do you like it? -Oh, yeah. The trouble with solar energy is that, uh, the sun doesn't always shine, you know. That's why every solar energy system has to have a back-up system, a conventional system, what the engineers call "redundant". -Not to mention expensive. -Mmm-hmm. Did you go to college? Yeah. North-Western. What did you study? Photography? No, no, that came later. Uh... Engineering, mostly. Uh, math. Astrophysics. -Oh, you like space stuff? -Yeah. Yeah, that's what I wanna do. But, also, like, oceanography and solar energy. So much to do, but so little time to do it in. Yeah, I could do it all. Oh, kid... You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Hang on to those ideas, you know, they're great. The world is really full of great things. You mean, like photography? Like photography. Thanks a lot. -So long. -See you. Uh, what's your name, anyway? Frank. -So long, Frank. -(CAR HONKING) Oh, hey, Mom! Come on, I want you to meet my Mom. -Oh, no, I've to... -Come on! Okay. Hey! Hey, neat, Mom, you're home early. What happened to your leg? Come over here. -Oh, nothing. -Ah, let me see, let me see. Frank, this is my mom. Mom, that's Frank. You'll like her. Susie Hanson. Frank Andrews. This is okay. Yeah, Frank cleaned it out for me. -Oh. -Man, it hurt like... (LAUGHS) Well, thank you very much, we appreciate it. How'd the interview go? Great. Listen to this. I'm up for a part as a dancing raisin. -A dancing... -(LAUGHS) A dancing raisin. Guess I, uh, better be off. Well, thanks, again. It was really terrific of you. -It's okay. Glad to help. -So long, Frank. Maybe we'll see each other again sometime. Yeah, sometime. Bye. MARK: I like him, he's a nice guy. SUSIE: Yeah, he seems to be. MAN: Who's next? Um... Susie Hanson. Okay. Hi, Susie, how are you? (LAUGHING) -Nice to see you. Look, I'm Frank, the director. -Hello. Uh, Steve. Steve. Look, I'm auditioning here. Sorry, girls. Girls, one minute. -Hi. Look, uh, this is a cereal commercial, right? -Right. You are a raisin popping out of a box. -You dance around a little boy eating cereal. -Right. Right, you are succulent. (LAUGHS) Yeah. You are ripe. Give me some music, huh? Let's see what you can do. Okay. Steve, dance along, dance along. -Girls, you can dance along if you want. Okay. -(PIANO PLAYING) Uh-huh, now kick the legs. Beautiful. Think raisins! Perfect! Ah, perfect! (WHOOPING) Absolutely. Huh? Huh? Okay, okay, cut it. Thanks a million! -Wow! Really nice. We'll be in touch. -Thank you. Thank you. -We'll be in touch. -Thank you. You probably heard me tell the other girl, "a cereal commercial". (WOMEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) -Um... -Hello. -Hi, uh... -Frank Andrews. -Right! Mark's friend. -Right. Oh. (LAUGHS) -This is my friend Lori. This is, um, Frank Andrews. -Hi. -How do you do? -Fine. -Oh, that's some camera! -Yeah, I'm a photographer. -Professional? -Yeah, yeah. Oh. Well, I gotta be going on. Get his number. Bye, Susie. -Oh, bye. -Bye. (STUTTERING) Say, I'm just in the neighborhood, taking some pictures, you know, people and... It's very hot, and I'm in the mood for a tall cool one, and I wondered if you'd like to have a drink. Um... Oh, I really shouldn't. Mark is coming home from school, and I gotta get home. I know a great place, it's just, you know, just a couple of blocks... -Oh, yeah? -Yeah, very close. Okay, sure. Here. I think it's... -Hi. -Hi. Would you like... What would you like? -Uh, just coffee. -Coffee and a beer. We're kind of in a hurry, okay? So, Mark was telling me that you went to North-Western and, um... Uh, you were into astrophysics and stuff like that. -Yeah. -How did you get to be a photographer? I don't know. I've always wanted to be one. I drifted into it, you know, like most people do. Postponed it for a while. -Do you mind if I smoke? -Oh, no. No, no. Um, is it hard to be a photographer? Well... -It's not hard to photograph. -Uh-huh. I love photography. It's what you have to do to support your artistic habit, you know. All those odd jobs. Thank you. Yep. I know about stuff like that. (LAUGHS) You know, I've always wanted to be a dancer. But I've had to take all kinds of crazy jobs, you know, to pay for my lessons and I was, um... -Let's see, I was a bank teller. -Mmm-hmm. I worked in a supermarket. That was boring. I worked in a gift store. In fact, the only time I wasn't dancing and taking lessons was when I was married and had Mark. But when my husband died, I, um... (STUTTERING) My husband died in a car crash. Anyway, when he died, I, uh, I decided I was gonna get back to my career seriously. So, I got a job dancing in a stock company. That was my best job, it was great. I have been really going on and on about myself! Oh, I'm so sorry! -It's okay. -No! I asked you about you. Oh, dear, let's see. I really do wanna know about you. -I'm Mr. Boring. -Oh, no. Listen, I'm really interested in what you do. Um... What kind of pictures do you like to take? -I like to take, uh, pictures of people, you know. -Uh-huh. As they are in their work. Is it, uh, difficult to support yourself taking those kind of pictures? (LAUGHS) It's impossible. There aren't very many good, you know, photography magazines, and those that do publish that kind of work are... They have their own favorite, you know, in-house photographers. -Hmm, yeah. -I got a stack of rejections like that. Oh, well. The world doesn't understand us struggling artistes. Yes, they do. They just don't want to pay us. (LAUGHS) That, too. -Um, I need... -Uh... -Oh. -I'm sorry. -Oh, no, I was just gonna ask what time it was. -Oh. It's, uh... Yeah. I gotta go. Mark's gonna be home from school any minute. Um... Could I ask a favor of you? Uh... Do you think you could take a picture of me that I could use for my commercial composite sheet? Sure. Oh, not now! No, no, no. -Oh, why not? The light is terrific. -Oh... -Hmm? Wait a minute. -Wait a second. Wait, wait. Um, how much do you charge, first of all? Dinner, tomorrow night. -(CAMERA CLICKING) -I can't. I can't. I can't. (LAUGHS) Lunch. -Okay. -Okay? -But, now? Wait a second. (EXHALES) -That's all right. -Ah, this feels so weird! Okay. How's that? -(CAMERA CLICKING) -(LAUGHS) -Great. I need a lot of smiling pictures for commercials, you know. -You've got plenty of smiles. -(LAUGHS) Okay, how's this? Ah, good. Now let's see what you got. They're no good! Is that an aesthetic judgment? Well, they don't show anything. What I need is totally nude shots, you know, with men. Well, you know what I want. (SIGHS) What about the tapes? Well, this is the best one. (WAILING) Something wrong with that tape? I'm surprised at you, Mr. Sterling, that's a whale singing. (WAILING CONTINUES) MARK: See, Mom? That's the way whales communicate with each other. Each one of these songs has a different meaning. There are even songs of distress. If a baby whale is in danger, the mother will warn her by singing a certain song. SUSIE: Whales are a lot like people. MARK: People should be more like whales. See, like, whales don't pollute. They don't kill for the pleasure or for the game. (WAILING CONTINUES) Well, just what am I supposed to do with that? (TURNS RECORDING OFF) I've listened to hours of tape, Mr. Sterling, there's nothing there. You've been leading me on, Frank. Telling me there's something where there's nothing! I sent you pictures of her stripping. Stripping? You call that stripping? That? Well, what about this? Stripping? That's what she does! -Oh, catch her with a guy. -She doesn't have a guy! Fix it! I don't fix photographs! You want that kind of work, you do it yourself! Or get somebody else to do it. Not this boy. I intend to do just that. -I'll send you my final bill. -Don't bother! I don't like being made a fool of. I won't pay it. (DOOR CLOSING) -SUSIE: Frank? Is that you? -Yeah. Oh, good, come on in. Uh, I'll just be a second. Hi. Hi. -(SOFTLY) Wow! -(GIGGLING) I'm ready. Just one second. Here. For you. Oh! (SIGHS) This is incredible. Just yesterday, I was telling Mark how much I wanted this book. -How did I know, right? -Yeah! Uh... (CLEARING THROAT) Well, I just figured that all good dancers like to read about the ballet. You must be clairvoyant. Uh, no, no. I just have great intuition. Uh, where would you like to eat? -I don't care. -Um... Uh... Is that place on the pier any good? Oh, yeah, it's fine. -Shall we? -Yeah. Okay. -Come on... -I can't. Ey, Susie! (LAUGHING) Hi! Hi! -How are you? -I'm okay. Uh... Frank Andrews, this is Harry Parkins. -Hello, Frank Andrews. How are you? -Frank. Yeah. How are you? -Good. Good. -Hey, any luck? No, they're not biting. No. Did Jill get you any work? -No, no, I'm still drawing unemployment. -Oh... There's not too many calls for a top banana. Or a second banana. As a matter of fact, all the bananas are split. (LAUGHING) Still pretty good, huh? Listen, I gotta get out of here. My worms are drying up. -Give me a call, will you? -(LAUGHING) -Nice meeting you, Frank. -Bye. -Hey, you didn't bring your camera today! -Hmm... I thought photographers are never without their cameras. Mmm, like a dancer without her feet. Yeah. Okay. -Show me the step, come on, come on. -No, I can't... Come on! Just a little. Okay. BOTH: One, two... Okay, move your hips a little bit, come on. This is silly. (LAUGHING) I think you look good. You know, I can show you lots of different kinds of dancing. Ballet, jazz... I can even show you how to do some exotic dancing. -No, no, stop. -Yeah. Yeah. I've been an exotic dancer. An ecdysiast, as in stripper. Yep. (LAUGHING) But, that was out of my dark past. I don't do it anymore. I didn't like it. Mark wasn't crazy about it either. Anyway, now you know. Show me the other steps. -Yeah? You game? -Yeah. -Wow! Okay. -Okay. Hold my purse. Okay, this is a real easy one. Okay, watch. -One, two... (LAUGHS) One, two... -I'm not gonna do that! -Come on! Just try, come on. -Hold my purse. Okay, okay. Put your fingers down, one, two... -Oh, this is a public pier... -Come on, do it. One... (LAUGHING) No, I can't... Susie, you know this business. -(PHONE RINGING) -It's "hurry up and wait". -Look, stick around, you'll probably get a call back. -(SIGHS) Okay. (EXHALES) Nothing yet, huh? No, but Jill says I should stick around, maybe I'll get a call back. -I'll wait with you. -Okay. How about you? No, nothing in show business. I got this call for a guide at this toy factory. And? -I couldn't fit into the uniform. -(BOTH LAUGHING) Aw... (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) Susie... I don't wanna poke into your business, but, uh... Why you dating guys at the club? I never did! -That guy I saw you with at the pier... -Yeah? -You didn't meet him at the club? -No. Mark met him at the beach. Seems like a nice enough kind of guy. Ever since I saw you with that guy, it's been bugging me. "Where'd I see his face?" Last night it dawned on me. That guy had been hanging out at the club. Are you sure about that? Susie, I don't forget faces. I thought you should know. -JILL: Susie... -Glad you told me. You can go home. No call back, sorry. Hey, Frank, there's my mom! Come on! Hey, Mom! Hey, look what Frank got me. He got me the earphones I needed. He even knew I needed a new battery pack. Come on, we've been trying them out. SUSIE: Okay, we'll be right there. You know... There's something I just don't understand. You seem to know exactly what Mark and I want. I mean, just the right ballet book, headphones and a new battery pack... I don't get it. Well, just a couple of lucky guesses. How come you didn't tell me you were at the Club Versailles? -I tried to the other day. -But you didn't. No, I didn't. The other day at the pier... I go into this whole, long story about how I've been an exotic dancer. And you don't say anything! You knew all the time! What were you doing at the club? Taking photographs. Why? I was hired to take photographs of you. Hired? Why? (STUTTERING) What for? By who? Walt Sterling. Why? He wants custody of Mark. Custody of Mark! Well, what did you give him? Some photographs, and some tapes. Tapes? How did you get tapes? I tapped your phone. You are disgusting! Well, it's too bad you wasted your time. Because I am one hell of a good mother. I know, that's what I told Sterling. Oh, really? Is that what you told Sterling? I don't ever wanna talk to you ever again! You leave me alone! -Mom, look what I've got! -Come with me. Come home. Now! What's the matter with Mom? -Go with your mother. Go on. -Come on, now! Wait, Mom. Will you tell me where we're going, at least? I'm not sure. I don't know. I like it here. I like it here, too. (SIGHS) I don't mean just the apartment. I mean all of this. California, the beach... I do, too. I'll miss the beach. So will I. Mom, look. -What? -Look! You listen to me, don't move. Stay here, I'll be right back. (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) What are you doing? I want you to leave Mark and me alone. Now, there's no reason to get upset, Susan. No reason? You've had someone spying on me. You bugged my apartment. What gives you the right? -You're leaving that boy alone and going off to... -Mark... Mark was with a sitter! And there was nothing wrong with the Versailles before it was sold. Susan, that's no way to raise a child. There is nothing wrong with my child! He's fine! He's healthy, he's happy, he's just fine! Now, look, why can't you be reasonable, Susan? Edith and I have the means to raise that boy the way he should be. -(SCOFFS) -Now, look, let me take Mark back to Oregon. See, then, you're free to live however you want. Pursue your career. See, Mark will always be just a couple of hours away. Just like that you expect me to walk away from my child and hand him over to you for safekeeping. I can give him the things he needs. Susan, I love the boy. That doesn't give you the right to try and take him away from me! Mark is very precious to me. And I will never leave him, ever! I'm warning you, Susan, I'll fight you for him. And I'll fight you right back! And here's another thing, you call off that creep. He quit. Well, don't bother to hire another one. You scared me. You scared me real good. You threatened me, too. But I'm not scared any more. There is nothing in my life I'm ashamed of. Well? You want to stay at the beach? We are staying at the beach. Come on, let's go. Unpack. What are you waiting for? What did he say? He wanted to take you away. I told him, "no!" -Take me away, where? Back to Oregon? -Oregon. He wanted us both to go back to Oregon. I told him we are staying here together, and I told him to leave us alone. -Think he will? -Oh, he better! Mom, why is Grandpa doing all this? Because he wants you with him. This whole thing stinks. I don't wanna go to one of you. I love you both. -(PHONE RINGING) -(SIGHS) -Hello? Oh! -Susie, it's Jill. -Hi, Jill. -You got it! You got the raisin commercial! -I did? Oh! That's great! -Yeah! You gotta be there in half an hour. -Oh, now? In half an hour? -Yeah, can you make it? I'll be there. No, I'll be there. I'll be there. Wait a minute, let me get a pen. Okay, hold on, hold on. -Go. Yeah. Yeah. -On the corner of Western and Olive, gray building. -Yeah, I know where that is. -Studio B. Oh, it's great! I almost dropped the phone. Okay. -Bye. I'll see you later. -Good luck. I got the raisin commercial! I got it, isn't that great? Let's go. We have to go right now. Come on, come on. -"We"? -Yeah. Oh! I don't know what your grandfather has planned. We're gonna stick together. Now, just leave it, it's okay. Come on. -Oh, you mean like diving buddies? -(LAUGHS) (INDISTINCT) -Right there? -That's good. -MAN 1: Quiet everybody. And, rolling camera. -MAN 2: Speed. -MAN 3: Production 39, take 43. -Okay, now, Susie, remember, -you're the raisin all America can love. -Yes. Got it? Do it. Roll by. (JINGLE PLAYING) * Meet Rosie, the raisin * She's the pick of the raisin land * Meet Rosie, the raisin * Come on and join in the raisin band * For breakfast and for luncheon * Or just a little healthy munchin' * There's a good reason for sunshine * But there's a lot of good reasons for raisins * DIRECTOR: Okay, cut! Print it! -(LAUGHS) Oh, thanks. -Amazing! Nice, nice, nice. -Thanks. -Great work. -Uh, what'd you think? Huh? -Well, I am so... -Well? -I liked you better as a stripper. SUSIE: Look, I don't want you hanging around here anymore, is that clear? Yes. I have these photographs. Great, I want them. I want all the photographs. -I'll bring them over. -Oh, no. I'm gonna come to you. Hold on. What's your address? -1357, Austin. -Mmm-hmm. -It's in Culver City. -Okay, um... -I can be there in about an hour. -(DIAL TONE HUMMING) Mom, he was only doing his job. That's a lowlife job. Mom, when you're broke, you can't choose your job. We were just another assignment to him, Mom. Look, Mark, I don't trust anything about that man. When he did get to know you, he liked you. And he quit. I don't like being made a fool of. -He tricked you, right? -Yeah. -He lied to you, huh? -(SCOFFS) He lied to me about everything! Well, you tricked me, you lied to me, you made a fool of me. Mark, that is entirely different. I forgave you. You just don't understand. Now, come on, I wanna drop you at Harry's. Let's go. Come on. Hurry up. (SIGHS DEEPLY) Are these all of them? Yes. (SIGHS) Can I believe you? Yes. Those are the pictures, the negatives, tapes, everything. I did it for the money. You know how that is. I... I want all of these, too. How can you do this? This stuff when you do such good work. Well... I don't know how to explain it. I've made so many mistakes in my life... (SCOFFS) Blown so many chances. I'm... I couldn't go through with this. I'm trying to turn things around, you know. Well... You're the only one that can do it. Okay. Thank you. (HUMMING SOFTLY) -Hello? -Hi, Abby, it's Susie. -Hi. -Uh, listen, send Mark home, lunch is ready, okay? But he's not here. What do you mean he's not there? I sent him over a half-an-hour ago. Well, he hasn't shown up. -You mean he never got there? -No, I haven't seen him at all. I'll look outside and see if I can find him. (STUTTERING) Um, I'll call you back. (PHONE RINGING) -Mark? -No, it's Frank. What are you calling for? What do you want? Susie, I wanna talk this out. Look, I can't talk now. Mark is missing. Do you know anything about this? No, of course not. What do you mean "missing"? I can't talk! Freddy, have you seen Mark? Will you go up there and look for me? -Susie? -What are you doing here? I wanna help you. He hasn't turned up? No, I... He's been gone over an hour. I can't find him anywhere. Have you covered that end of the beach? -Well, yeah, I've been down... -Settle down, settle down. Cover that end of the beach, down to the third lifeguard box. I'll cover this end and I'll meet you by the swings in an hour, okay? (INAUDIBLE) Susie, here. It's getting cold. Let's try the pier again, okay? What you did, hiring Frank, I think that was wrong. Please try and understand, Mark, I hired Frank to find you because I thought it was the only way I could get you back with me again. My mother will fix it so that I never see you again. She'll do that. She's afraid of you. She's afraid that you'll change her life so that... (SIGHS) She doesn't want to live in your big house. You can live nearby. No, she wants to live in LA. To dance. And I wanna live with her. Look at it my way. See, when your mother took you away, I got mad. All I could think was I wanted you back with me, no matter what the price. I still think you'd be better off living with me. No, Grandpa. I belong with my mom. (SIGHS) Oh, boy, I've done a terrible thing in all this. I'm afraid I may have ruined things forever. Lost you, just like I once lost your father. SUSIE: Mark, let's go. Susan? I'm going back to Oregon tonight. I won't bother you anymore. Mom, can we go visit Grandma and Grandpa sometime? For Christmas for a few days? Please. Please? Edith and I would like that visit very much, Susan. Is everything okay? I think so. I'm glad. Could I see you again? Mom, could you at least think about it? Yeah.
