I'm a traveler who has lost his way. Everyone left me. Life has brought me to death's door. Give me shelter for a night. Just for a night. Oh long distance traveler Do take me along too I have been left alone Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Master, can I dare to ask what my fault was? Fault! You are blindly lost... in the world of light and spirit. Over here, the dead reside. Living beings can't stay here. You mean she... She's the Goddess. She's the Almighty. She had come to assure this impatient heart. While supporting you, I have lost my support. The ones who were to come have left. They will never come now. Please tell me, where do they come from? I'll risk my life and get them back. You cannot get them. Nobody can get them here. They live on the moon. A man cannot touch them. My heart shudders on mentioning it. Forty years ago... Accept our greetings Accept my greetings and the message from the heart Take the drink of love Oh traveler on the uran khatola (uran khatola - magical flying vehicle) Accept my greetings and the message from the heart Take the drink of love Oh traveler on the uran khatola Flying with the wind, in the shadow of the clouds... to which village will you go? Down here's the earth. The world is beautiful My heart is certain that you'll come Accept my greetings and the message from the heart Take the drink of love Oh traveler on the uran khatola You're flying high. Your life depends on the wings There's a storm ahead, don't move on The destination is far off. You're tired and despondant But you will come. I know you will come Accept my greetings and the message from the heart Take the drink of love Oh traveler on the uran khatola Please come over, oh traveler on the flight Oh traveler, please come over Run! Water! Water! - Run, run! - Water! Soni, he's gasping for breath. I'll get the medicine. Nothing to see. C'mon. We need air. Move. Move away! Have you no manners? Who are you? I'm not dead I suppose. What place is this? Who got me here? Stranger, have you regained your senses? - Who are you? - Me? My name is Heera but people have made me miserable. Who's she? Over there. Over there! It's a pillar. But I was seeing something else. You have survived but have lost your sight. Your eye sight is even better than mine. She's my sister. The one who saved your life. - Can't she speak? - Yes, she can But you can't hear her voice. - Why so? - It's the law of the land. Girls over here don't speak to unknown men. Barring the man they choose for their marriage. - The King has summoned. - We'll be right there. The King of this region has summoned you. Come. Who's he? My father. The most powerful in this kingdom. The Queen and people of the kingdom bow to him. Let's go. Lord Tanga. When sin in our country crosses its limit... his mouth begins to spew fire instead of smoke. And then comes such a storm that... devastates the whole region. Heetu! Oh God! Stranger, let's get out of here. This fool has chosen me as her groom. - What a woman! Let's go. - He has fled! I won't spare you the next time. The land has a severe punishment for every offence. They had taken false oaths. Any woman who's suspected of promiscuity... is made to walk on fire. Boy, strangers aren't allowed to stay... here for more than eight days. You'll have to go. Father, all the exit routes are blocked. The order to leave in this condition... is like a death sentence. Not an issue. I fear a life which is unable to repay one's favor. They both have saved my life. Boy, all I have is a blessing and... not the power to break the law. You'll have to visit the Queen. He still has to go. Shyamu, you should respect the religious... feelings before interfering. I beg your pardon. These strangers come here to cheat the girls. I can't give anyone permission... to play with the dignity of the land. - The Queen has the right to that. - Oh! It's for Soni. Heetu, please take him to the Queen. The complainant may enter. Oh Queen, the stranger... comes to disturb the peace of the kingdom. He should be asked to leave the kingdom. That shall happen. Oh! Tell me. - I'm a stranger. - It's evident from the voice. I wanted permission to stay on over here. Why? As the land and the people in it are beautiful. And then there's no way to return either. The heart wishes that... What the heart wants is difficult to get. Take him away. Can I not even request mercy? No. You're related to danger and tyranny. Outsiders are con men. Free him. Where do you hail from? India. What is famous about that place? Love and music. You'll play some? If I get the permission to stay on. You have the permission. You may go. Stay away from the girls over here. Our law is very strict for the outsiders. You may go. You are scared? Don't be. Things have immensely improved with your arrival. Hasn't it? The moon wasn't that beautiful. The flowers weren't that fragrant. You have brought spring into my life. I hope you won't take away the peace of mind. These mountains, this city... these clouds... these fountains, do you like them? And me? The moon is the witness that I like you. There came a guest at home He's become a beloved and there's been no introduction yet He's very cruel. He's very cruel There came a guest at home He first entered the eyes and then the heart He brought moonlight into my life He peeps through the moon's window, standing away He teases me and troubles me The mind becomes dishonest He's very cruel. He's very cruel There came a guest at home He's become a beloved and there's been no introduction yet He's very cruel. He's very cruel The naughty one speaks only through gestures My heart beats violently The eyes flutter The eyes play havoc and hurt the heart I happen to lose my sleep The cruel one pretending to be innocent shouldn't feel proud He's very cruel. He's very cruel There came a guest at home He's become a beloved and there's been no introduction yet He's very cruel. He's very cruel Heetu, didn't you tell me once that it's not safe to talk to girls? But what if the girl herself happens to talk? You're asking? You should get hold of her feet at once. You should rub them on your forehead... and one should cry a lot to win over their heart. But then what about the rule of your land? That ends with the girl's acceptance. The Queens' approval order and congratulations. - I didn't get you. - Oh! I hope you have borne in mind the condition... of your permission. What condition? Why hide the fact? The guest mansion is decorated and waiting for you. - Let's go. - Please forgive me. Brother, brother, you'll have to go. The Queen's order is not overruled. Not over there. This is your place. I do recognize my place. Outsider, praise me. It's difficult to praise, praise. What should I praise? My hair. Outsider, you are my guest. Would you do me a favor? You just have to order. Sing a song that sets me on fire. - You want to get burned? - Yes, stranger. Sing. Sing a song. A song that will awaken my desires. Tread the paths of love carefully The one who has reached here has lost it all Tread the paths of love carefully No one has reached the destination of love The steps falter after walking just a little distance Tread the paths of love carefully The Spring looks for us Where have I landed from the sky? Tread the paths of love carefully A heart full of desires shouldn't break Don't shift your aim while shooting the arrow Tread the paths of love carefully Girl, was it you who shot the arrow? Yes. A cruel arrow escaped from my quiver. I shot the arrow to save it. Let her hands be cut off. Take her away. Queen, I request mercy as she's my friend. A friend! Like what? She saved my life when I was lying... in the blazing fire and smoke. Do you love your friend a lot? A few people are born to love. - Free her. What's your name? - Name... yes. My name's Shibu. Shibu means love with one's heart. Oh yes, something like that. You learn it. Shibu? I'm unfortunate. It's the frogs that get hooked and not the fish. Heetu! Your fish is here. Oh my! What a weird nose you possess! She won't let the innocent live. Heetu! It's not a rose but a piece of my heart. Here, I throw my heart at you. Heetu! It's not a cabbage but my tiny lung. I throw my lungs at you! Dear, now move away! You'll start weeping if I hold you. She's troubling a soul which is already troubled on the banks. No games! No games! You don't even cut your nails. You've scratched my body! Inauspicious! Is she a woman or an adhesive! She's just getting closer! Move away! Look, dear, it's too much now! One shouldn't joke near the river bank. Please go away. She stinks! She doesn't even wash her mouth! Filthy one! Move away! Bear! God! Heetu! Listen. Come to the fort on hearing my voice. The voice will be from my heart and life shall pass by. Stop playing the music. It's got pain in it and no remedy. The moon's on a high today. The waves of the stream are waiting for the ocean. Tylandi, I love both, waves and youthfulness. The security? Don't worry. The moonlight will guard me today. Play safe... with the river's high waves Thousands of hearts will burn and the water will catch fire Play with neither the storm nor the banks Come near me and play with my heart Don't play with the storms The waves of passion tell you... get the boat of love to the shore Walk along in the world of love Play with the destination, now that you have found the way Come near me and play with my heart Don't play with the storms The fire in the heart can't be extinguished with water It'll keep spreading if you try doing so Don't bother about what the world will say Play with difficulty, if love is difficult Come near me and play with my heart Play with neither the storm nor the banks Thank you. Those clothes are mine. It's not a voice in your throat, but magic. I really liked your song. I mean that... I know it all. What you couldn't express, you said in song. I sang this song for... I know. It was for me. It was for love. It was for love. - I'm a Queen and I am Love, too. - You... I didn't know that you were here... I'm present everywhere. I'm present in every color. Especially, when the moon's... - at it's brilliant best. - Right. - I come to be greeted by the waves. - You did? Even I become a wave getting mingled with them. Lend me support. Look, please don't get me wrong. - I, actually... - I'll never get you wrong. No, no... - Please listen to me. - I've heard all I need. I had come for you but the Queen... The Queen bought you up. You made false promises. You only have a handsome face... but you don't have a good heart. You don't have a good heart! You don't have a good heart! Soni, don't be crazy. Try to understand me. Leave me. I built a palace and you set it ablaze. I wish there was nothing like love in this world! Brother! The stranger is innocent! Brother! No! He can't be a fool as he has cheated. He'll have to die. Brother! No! - I've chosen the outsider. - What! If there is any fault, it is mine. Why have you refrained from hitting me? My life and death depend on her. Stranger, nobody can separate the two of you from now on. Play with neither the storm nor the banks Come near me and play with my heart Don't play with the storms and... - Oh, brother! - Soni! - I feel like singing today. - No, no... Crazy, not now. I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to finish it. - Why not? - It's because he's an outsider. First get permission from father. Then you can sing a song and even light... the auspicious lamps. Oh, brother! I want such make up today that the... beloved falls for me the moment he sees me. Today I want a necklace... that makes an impact on his heart. Let me wear it. It's my victory today. It's my victory today. - Who do you think you have won over? - I won't say. - Who was he? - I won't tell! That's fine. He's the king of a far off country! Oh yes! You'll feel jealous on seeing him. - I'll be jealous? - Yes. Even I came here searching for my sweetheart. - Queen? - Yes, a queen. The flower-like cheeks, pearl-like teeth. Even you'll feel jealous when you happen to see her. Soni. Give a call as I have come for you. I, too, have come for you. I knew that you must be waiting for me even today. - You see, but... - What do you want? We're both here and there's love, too. - There's somebody else too. - Who's that? The Almighty. You fear God. Don't you fear love? Come with me. - I, excuse me. I have got to... - Don't waste time. I've come to take you. It's a special guest room of mine. No other person can come here. Not even air is permitted to pass by this. I light these lamps and it's I who extinguishes them. - What are you looking at? - Your grandeur. Of what are you thinking? The consequences. Don't ponder over it. Those who fear the waves are stuck at the shore. Those who jump into the sea get the pearls. Life is a beautiful toy. Don't fear it but learn to play. The game of love can't be played everywhere. The one who doesn't hold hands in life usually gets lost. Come. Let's strike a bargain for our lives. A bargain is made for goods, not human beings. You haven't witnessed the world's strength. It can buy everything. But not the man's heart. It sells itself for free if it so desires. No wealth in the world can buy it if it decides not to. You carry attitude. At first, I think showing attitude is good. This is the result of spying on a palace. Take her away. Maid, someone's a maid of love today. Maid, only music won't do today. A voice should accompany it too. Don't go leaving my heart Don't get deceived as the world is very dishonest Oh beloved, the world is very dishonest Strange I'm the first souvenir of love I narrate the heart's story through the eyes today Listen to me as I beg of you Dear, I'm requesting you Be with me all through life and don't hurt me Beloved, I don't have respect Oh beloved, the world is very dishonest Don't go leaving my heart Don't get deceived as the world is very dishonest Strange It's difficult to speak a few nice words here Never disclose your secrets to the world Love here is a charade Nobody's a friend here The world today has turned vile Make it a better place as my soul is confused Oh beloved, the world is very dishonest Don't go leaving my heart Don't get deceived as the world is very dishonest Strange Cease, maid. The stone didn't melt, but only became harder. Come, dear. Have you any idea what trouble you're in? I'm aware. A woman is almost dead anyway. Now she got killed. I've come to save you. The one who killed has left with the Queen. He didn't go but you let him go. Do you see these mute pictures? - I'm even hearing their voice. - Voice? But I haven't heard it until now. A heart's voice is heard through another heart. Not through ears. Even your thoughts are nice, just like your face. You have seen it. It'd have been better if I had died! Take me back! Queen, what's this? The gift of love. - I can't accept it. - Do so. It's not a ring but my love. The one who accepts it becomes mine. And the one who rejects it has to lose many things. Soni, you laugh. Laugh heartily! The outsider now belongs to you. - It's not possible. - Why not? Your brother went there to check his sister's future. Even Father has given permission. Sing! Sing songs of joy! Take this. I have even brought the bridal costume for you. I've even lit the auspicious lamps. Extinguish these lamps! Extinguish these lamps! Soni! Soni! I don't wish to dream. Soni! Soni! Crazy girl! You're crying at the time of celebration? C'mon get up. The same young guard has come... and he has some important message. Bring him in. - Guard... - You have come? - You got permission? - Sit down. Sit down. I asked you to stop meeting me. No! I'll meet the Queen. I got the permission with great difficulty. - That was a favor by you, maid... - Hey... Don't address me as a maid! That won't do. Bring it. Get me my reward. Oh Lord, I'm ready to even die for you! What else do you want? Those who kill cannot die for someone else! I'm asking, have you gotten married? I keep trying to sell off my heart but there's no buyer! What kind of buyer are you looking for? Just like you. You appear a simpleton but you... are quite smart. Listen, don't mention this to the Queen. - We'll talk about each other later. - Okay. Where are you going? It's a woman's rule over here. Follow me. Hey, not that way. Look, don't nod in front of her. Keep your head bowed. And yes, salute with a little bow. Move fast. Shibu. You must've got the message of the stranger. My friend has returned this gift of yours. He has also said that he can't fulfill your wish. You can go. Don't waste time. The gift has reached the person it belonged to. - But who took it away? - Me! Don't sell yourself so easily. Your value is much higher. Get going from here by tomorrow morning. This is the last and final order of the Queen. How can the order be fulfilled? The roads are blocked. The path to life must've got blocked. That of death is open I suppose. No matter where you go, no matter how you go... just get lost from this kingdom! - Please listen to me. - I can't listen to anything! You'll be responsible for the outcome if you don't leave! Take this, the orders of the Queen! Disguised as a man I could do what... I couldn't as a woman. The stranger's life's in danger. The stranger's life's in danger? Yes. I'm going to light the lamps with all my joy today. So that he gets blessed and I become a pauper for life. - Who's that dacoit? - The Queen. - The Queen! - Yes. The queen can play with someone's life but not the heart. You go, you stay with the stranger. I'm going to father. - Two complainants... - I won't meet anybody today. - The young hunter. - Tell him to leave. Even the stranger is with him. Let them come. Why have you come now, stranger? To ask about the duty of the Queen. One is supposed to obey the orders in my kingdom... and not question my decisions. I wish to know the law of the land. I was given the right to stay till the ship arrived... and now I'm being denied it. - Is it not an insult to the law of the land? - No! The people here object to the freedom you have here. They believe the outsiders are liars and frauds. You'll have to stay under my protection if you wish so. - I can't agree to this condition! - I do. I have a heart of love. Not a palace with wealth. Queen, I surrender my friend to you. Stop. Come here. This is your reward. Let it remain with you. Queen, a friend can't be measured in wealth. What else could it be? Permit me to stay in the palace. That'll do. What work do you know? Work! Me? I can laugh! I can cry, too. Please listen! I can even narrate good stories. I bring two hearts together. The hearts! - What else do you know? - Me? I can sing. Let a friend stay with another to accompany him, oh Queen. It'll be better. Leave! Leave! - You! - Why? - How could you reach here? - You go away as you're in danger! - I'm in danger? When will you return? I have not yet reached my destination. You look after everything till I return. That's my job. - I die for... - What are you babbling! I'm not a girl but a boy! This! That big! Please recognize me! - She's known as Chhamiya. - Chhamiya? - What nonsense is this! - No nonsense, my brother! I'm a boy. I like her a lot. Open your eyes. Open them. What's this disease like? It's not a disease. This love in motion can be called... - You can name it after any sweet you like. - Oh! So sweet! She walks as if she's going to create a storm. - Soni. - You have begun to stammer? - Address me as Shibu. Shibu. - Shibu! Oh Shibu! - Shibu. - Shibu. - Shibu! - Who's he? - He's my brother. Brother, the moon with the name Chhamiya. A weird moon. He's still a kid. Oh! Listen, your brother has begun to sigh! It's the fault of the heart. The heart loses control on seeing you. - Shibu, your brother looks okay. - Don't call me brother! You can do whatever you like... but don't address me as a brother! - As uncle? - No, that sounds elderly. As grandfather? Well, we'll decide later. - Come and hug me as it's our family's custom. - No, brother! You manage with a hand shake for now. - You can embrace her after marriage. - Oh. Saw that? What a boy! He doesn't even trust a brother. No problem. We can have a handshake then. - Your hands are really soft! - Even your hand's nice. You better leave now... as you'll be in trouble if someone sees you here. Shibu... there has to be a celebration of my wishes today. Do such magic that your friend forgets... everything else and becomes mine. - What happened? - Sorry! I broke the glass. Look, let not the heart break. Queen, the broken heart is even more precious. You may go. I have decided to win today and I will be victorious. Seclusion. Why did you call me? To pacify my heart as I was feeling scared. You feel scared in spite of all this luxury. I'm can't understand that. Look into my eyes. They will explain everything. The white curtains hanging... I don't see anything else. Do not look at those things. Look for the love. That's what I wanted to show. That which is displayed is something else. It's not love. Shibu... - Shibu, have you ever fallen in love? - Sorry? I did dream but it wasn't fulfilled. Your dream was left unfulfilled. Do help me realize my dream. You did say that you unite two broken hearts. Fulfill your promise today. How, Queen? Your music has the sound of love. Sing. Get the flying heart to the ground. I want to create a new world of desires. A world like that gets created on its own. It can't be forced. - I'll still try anyway. - Try it. Let your music express my heart's plight today. How do I describe... the plight of the heart? It's difficult In the form of sheer innocence... the killer is right in front of me How do I describe the plight of the heart? Let my boat of hope reach the shore now Hey storm, you please hold on The shore is right in front of me How do I describe the plight of the heart? Enthusiasm asks me to move ahead... and sense advises me to take care To which should I pay heed? The destination is right in front of me How do I describe the plight of the heart? Hey storm, you please hold on Stop singing. Stop singing this song. Shibu, you may leave. Stranger, what happened? - There was a storm-like feeling to this song. - No. The music had my feelings. The words are his and the cry is mine. What was that for? The pain of the heart needs medicine. The heart's pain isn't good. You please call the royal doctor for that. A stone! Man, come with me. Look at my eyes. You too are a man, right? My eyes can recognize men. - How then did these eyes go wrong? - Sorry? - Mistake! - Yes. Tell me the truth. Are the women blind? Then what's the reason that all my attempts are falling flat? Am I not young and beautiful? Too much. Then why can't the stranger see the love in my eyes? Love has to go through fire to attract someone. Oh Queen, even a defeat in love tastes sweet. Get defeated if you want to win! I have found you after many days. I won't spare you that easily now. - Come on. - But listen to me. My neck! It'll break off! Free me now! What is this?! The neck shall... Heetu! Heetu! Oh God, what have you done? I was just joking and you've turned into a real donkey! Dear, who cast an evil eye on you? Oh dear donkey, who has done this to you? Dear, why do you interfere with it? - He's my dear Heetu. - What are you saying? He's my donkey. His name is Jeetu. How dare you call him a donkey? - He's Heetu. - How dare you call him Heetu? He's my donkey. He's name is Jeetu. Heetu is going over there. Look over there. He's cheated on me again? Fraud! I'll not spare him. Open the door or I'll break down the wall! Come out I said! Where are you? Where are you hiding? - Come out in the open. - Sister, let this remain a secret. He's gone to drown in the river for you. He's gone to drown in the river? Coward! He has no shame! Has he gone to drown in the river? Heetu! Heetu! Heetu! I have brought the stuff and I can't see brother Heetu today. Where has he gone? He's been polishing his sword since morning. He's just gone out in anger. Sword? Anyway, never mind. I came here to tell you that you don't... worry as the stranger is having a ball. He's enjoying life. Since he's gone to the palace he's forgotten everyone. Forget it! How am I concerned with the stranger? I'm interested in you. In fact I'm... Yes go ahead. - I'm attracted to you. - Say it again. You'll come to know about it at the ceremony. I, what can I do for you? Brother isn't present in the house. Come let's play a game called Kabaddi. My father died playing that. Let's play some other game. - Become a horse please. - A horse! What joke is this? My maternal grandmother was very fond of it. - Please oblige. For my sake. - No, no... I make you swear on me. Please don't make me swear! People... I'll become one if you insist. Here! Here I go. Please be considerate! The bones are breaking! It's a test of love. That's enough now! Let's... Let's have some discussion on love. - Oh my! Before the ceremony? - Yes! Our love is no less than any ceremony. Soni! - What's the matter? - Oh my! Brother has come. Let this be a secret as it's a matter of prestige. Please hide me somewhere! Hide me! Okay, come along. Please come soon. Hurry up. - Where do I hide? Where do I hide? - Please get inside. - Okay, okay. - Please get inside. Please go. Don't make noise I tell you! Hodal, take up the swords. I want to avenge the enemies. - Please bear it as it's a time of test. - It's very painful! Oh my! Please bear it. All the pain will vanish in the ceremony. I can't take it any longer! I just have to give up now! Oh my! What now! - Please run away as brother has gone to call the neighbors. - Okay. Please have a glass of juice before you leave. Stop this nonsense now. That rooster has skinned me! Why did you hand over a friend to an enemy? The enemy is powerful and only this could save his life. What if you happen to lose him forever? I prefer to die belonging to you rather... than belonging to the Queen. Someone's coming. Stranger, why are you standing outside? No reason. I was just standing and... I was... I was just waiting for you. - Let's go inside. - Inside? No. Just see! There's a cool breeze outside. - The clouds in the sky... - I want to ask something. - Stranger. - Yes. Yes, Queen. Your comforts. Nobody else can give you besides me. Wow! What a beautiful hand! Wonderful! I just feel like watching it all the while. You look very handsome nowadays. - What happened? - Nothing... In fact, I can see many more things clearly here. What do you see? All the lines in it seem to be going towards heaven. - All these lines. - Get ready. - Ready for what? - We'll stroll around the river. - We'll even share some sweet words. - I see! River, alright. A thief! Open the door. It's me! It's me! Your hunter. - Speak up! Speak up! Why did you shout? - Thief! He first appeared in my eyes. Then he entered my heart through the eyes. He's now standing right in front of me! Hey, open your eyes. Where is he standing? - You only are my heart's thief! - You fool! You always keep day dreaming! Go! Go and sleep now! Open the door. I asked you to open the door. - Wrestler, don't take the trouble. He's left. - He's left? It's good he's run away. - Or else I'd have bashed him up today. - Oh! - You are really very brave! - Hear that! You haven't witnessed my bravery. - Once a girl got attracted to me. - Really? A wrestler began to attract her. I didn't pay any attention and got stomped to the ground. What do I see on turning back? The wrestler is lying on the ground and heaving! - What! - Yes, heaving. - My heart is pounding! - No, it isn't. - Let me see if... - Hey you! No touching! I'm going now. I've a headache. Come, let me massage your head. - Remove the turban! - Not the turban! No! - Not the turban! - Why not? - It's a woman's duty to serve the man. - Hey you! It'll be all over if a woman happens to... remove the turban from a man's head. - I'm going now. - Stop. Is it really bothering you? It was the head earlier and now it has reached the heart. Come to the river bank. I'll go for a stroll. River bank. Let's go. Let's go. Stay away! Stay away! Let's get some air. Dear, let him get some air. I'm asking you to remove the turban. You'll be relieved. Hey! Had it been someone else, I'd have hit him. I'll now stab you! Kill me, dear. The old story will be revived. Look over there. Many years ago, two lovers used to row their... boat together in the river and sing a song of love. There was a third girl in between them all of sudden. The boat capsized. That rock stands as a witness to their story. Oh! The Queen's come! - Shibu. - Yes... Why are you here? Sorry, I... I was cleaning the stuff here. I came to know that Your Majesty is going to the river. I thought that you might need me. No. I don't need you today. You may go. Please take him as he knows how to unite two souls... and unite two separated people. Queen, I can even row the boat. Shibu, why all these ideas? Me, everything for others. Nothing for my sake. Okay. Come and sit. You have sat at a distance. What difference does it make if the hearts are united? Say something even more romantic. What's the need to utter anything... for the one who's in love? Two lovers lost in each other's love used... to sing a love song sitting on a boat. All of a sudden another girl happened to... creep in and the boat capsized. Shibu, take care. I'm afraid we may get swept away by the currents. My boat will surely reach the river bank if I sing. My beloved will alight... at the shore Oh river, flow a little more slowly Flow slowly, flow slowly, oh river The naughty currents and the flowing water The ever flowing river The boat is an old one and the current is strong The whirlpool does exist. Oh river, do flow slowly. My beloved will alight at the shore Oh river, flow a little more slowly Flow slowly. Flow slowly, oh river The world acknowledges your force No one has an idea about the sea in the heart Either I know or it's my beloved Oh river, flow a little more slowly My beloved will alight at the shore Oh river, flow a little more slowly Flow slowly. Flow slowly, oh river The boat is being stopped by the storm He stares silently. He stares silently The rower is left helpless The oar slips out of his hand Oh river, flow a little more slowly Flow slowly. Flow slowly, oh river Boy, you once tried to shoot an arrow at me. Later, you tried to sink the boat. Speak up! Do you still have something to say? - No, nothing. - Take him away. Such guilty ones are fit only to be hanged. You'll be whipped by the stranger... since you're a friend of his. Queen, a weak man can't face the force of the nature. Please forgive him. I could've forgiven him if he had attacked me. He tried to get my beloved drowned. A clever foe is better than a foolish friend. Begin the punishment. What's there to think over? - Punish him. - He's my friend. A friend can't hit another. I seek forgiveness. Take him away. Behead him. Stop. Queen, I'll myself punish my naive friend. The naive one has been punished for his folly. Forgive him now. It's dangerous for you to stay here. Get lost from the palace immediately. Soni... I didn't hit you, but the soul and heart of mine. I'd have lost you if I didn't do so. I can understand. I know you didn't hit me. But how can I stay away from you? You had to go through the pain for me. These hands have committed a crime... to love for the sake of life. I can't ask you to forgive me for this. You go away from here. Somebody's coming. Will you meet me tomorrow? You wait for me at the hill when... the moon will be overhead. The lightning in the form of clouds. What's the matter? I'm still alive. You did slavery all your life but got nothing out of it. The stranger did win over the Queen's... heart by inflicting you with the hunter. You can still decide for yourself as to who's what. He was with me and he still belongs to me. Be alert while guarding. Keep awake. This way. This direction. Go at the door. The one for whom you're waiting doesn't care for you. - He won't come. - He'll come. The palace walls are built of stone. - Nothing can stop love and death. - Soni! - You know, you'll have to lose something. - I know. I'll have to lose everything. I even know that he'll come. You'll have to move away when he comes. It's a deal. Wait for him! The night has come with... a hope at its heart I am now going with the world... that I have lost The stars are shining bright and you haven't arrived I have called upon you Oh beloved! I did call upon you and you didn't arrive The separated souls are weeping all the way Oh it's like a caravan The moon has lost its sheen and the sky is mute The moonlight has left, getting upset as you haven't come You haven't come The stars are shining bright and you haven't arrived It is shining and you haven't come Only we two stars are visible now Please come over as the love's calling you Everyone's gone to sleep, but you haven't turned up Oh dear, please come over The love's calling you Hey! Come here! Come here! Go! Kill them! Kill them! What are you looking at? It's the land's prestige at stake! Hit them! Kill them! Hit them! Kill them! Hit them! Kill them! Stop! Please stop! What mistake have these two kids committed? - They have stained us! - They have sinned! Kill them if they have sinned. Kill them both. But only the person who's never committed... a sin in life can qualify to kill them. I'll take them to the Queen if you... think they have committed a sin. She'll pass judgement. The priest is coming to meet you. Bring him in with due respect and reverence. The savior of the estate, oh Queen... people have taken the law unto their... own hands by punishing a couple in love. I have come for justice and the justice lies with you. If they are proved innocent, let them be handed... over to me so that the faith can take care of them. It'll be so. Let the accused be presented. I suggest you to announce the decision... without having a look at them. Or else, you'll have trouble. Let them be summoned. A cruel girl was spared of my arrow. He's my friend and a friend cannot beat another. Queen, what are you contemplating? Pass judgement, as they have come to you for justice. Respected priest, they'll receive full justice. When will that happen? Today. As you are aware that there's a certain... procedure to deal with such accused. The law of the land shall take its course. Test of fire! Long live the Queen! Long live the Queen! Long live the Queen! Long live the Queen! Your Majesty, the blaze is at its peak. The flames are asking for food! Test of fire. It's not a test of fire but a joke on humanity. Dear, it's the test of your love today. Prove today that the moon can get stained but the... blood of a Peshwa (king) can never become contaminated. - The drug that causes inebriation? - I've mixed it in. It'll cause inebriation the moment she consumes it. The drink sent by the Queen. Take it. May the Almighty help you. No! No! No! I'm over and done with! I'm ruined! Ajab Singh! - What? - I'm devastated! Move away! - Hey... - Have you gone crazy? - Crazy! Yes, I've gone mad! Had it not been for my madness... why else would I have fallen for that con man? Who deceived you? The one, the girl that went through the test of fire! She came disguised as a man and swept me off my feet. She promised to marry me and went... away with some other man. Oh! So you want your wish... to get married be fulfilled? But how's that possible? I thought she was a boy but she's a girl. - I shall marry you. - You? Jingo you? You? - But under one condition. - I'm ready for any. You'll have to change your statement. You'll have to say it was the stranger... and not the girl who conned you. I'm with you! Fine! What else do I need now that you're with me? - I'm ready! - Oh! The bird has been trapped. - Please sign without a second thought. - Jingo! Take advantage of the opportunity. Please sign it. The rest will be taken care of. I have granted the stranger with the... permission to sit in the ceremony. Greetings. Our boss has complained that... the stranger has molested a girl named Shamiya. The accused must be arrested. Signed by the Queen. Priest, the stranger has been plotted against. Priest, we are afraid you may get... stained for the sake of the stranger. I believe it's better to accept death than to... lead a life humiliating an old respected man. - Take me along. - Priest! The stranger did no such thing! Priest, he's innocent! When the atmosphere gets heated... the clouds burst and there's a cool shower. The stranger hasn't done any such thing! He's innocent! - No! Don't hit her! - Don't take him away! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! He's innocent! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! The only hope that I had latched onto is also finished All because I happened to miss your hand once The hope's gone The world couldn't see me in happiness When they couldn't force themselves on love... they snatched away my beloved Oh my! The beloved The world has taken away all my dreams All because I happened to miss your hand once The hope's gone The thirsty soul was shown the sea but got the water now Oh, owner of the world... Oh, owner of the world, even you... haven't paid any heed to me You didn't understand my pain of love Oh my! You didn't My fate came crashing down and the luck got crushed All because I happened to miss your hand once Stranger, how are you doing? I informed you much earlier that... the law of the land is very strict for strangers. The one that crushes love and calls it a law... - is not a Queen but a stain on the country. - Shut up! You have insulted my love. Do keep in mind that you can't even marry anybody else. I'm a woman and a Queen too. Queen, please say it. Victory or defeat? - He's stubborn. - Then? He still refuses to marry me. Your conscience has fallen asleep but... my experience is waking up. - I'm still not ready to give in. - Then? The ceremony is the day after tomorrow. Summon Soni and show her the difficulties of the stranger. Ask her to garland me if she wishes to see him alive. What then? She loves the stranger. She'll give in immediately when... she sees him in difficulty. I'm ready to take up the burden... to clear your way and make you happy. You're a selfish and cheap man, too. Bring her but with prudence. I'm always at your service. Come! Come in. I've explained everything to the Queen. Your troubles will be over once and for all. Your Majesty, I can't see the tears in her eyes. If it's for the sake of my old loyalty then... I request you to be lenient towards her. Oh, the hunter has come to my door. The woman has come to me in her original form. Say what you wish to say. Actually, you are not a woman but a Queen. I request you, I beg of you... the stranger is innocent! Please set him free. Queen, please set him free! Please free him! - I'll free him but there's a condition to it. - What! What condition? Promise me that you'll garland Shangu in the... ceremony if at all you wish to save the stranger. If the promise isn't fulfilled, then... my men will kill the stranger. Queen, don't force a promise on me to... live taking away my life from me! Please don't do so as I can't live without him! Don't you love the stranger? More than my life! Don't you wish him a life? More than anything else! But I wish to marry him! Queen, I don't wish to lose him! You have learned to make others pine... yet not suffer yourself. You told me yesterday that... I should be losing if I wished to win. I'm telling you today! Give him up if you wish him to live! No, no... Queen, please have mercy on me! I'll become senseless of pain! Queen, I'll lose my senses! Please show his face to me! Let me see the stranger's face please! You can manage to see? See. The iron rods have become red hot. The knives have been sharpened. The verdict will be carried out... if you delay any further. He'll first lose his eyes and then... the hands will be chopped off. Then his face shall be made ugly. He won't be able to hold anyone's hand! He won't be able to look at anyone! He'll never be able to love someone. - Oh Goddess, what do I do? - Don't be so heartless. Transform yourself into love! Stop this injustice! Stop this injustice! I'm ready to accept your condition! I'm ready to accept your condition! Hand over the accused to Soni. Announce that the maid's claim... was found to be baseless. Oh! I'm at your service. This marriage can't take place! This marriage can't take place! - It can't... - Move away! It's tyranny! It's tyranny! You cheat! You remember your promise! I don't remember anything! - Is this why I supported you? - Stay out of it! I won't let those innocents suffer! - Do whatever you like! - No! I'll stop you at any cost! Stop me if you can! Move away! Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest, please save Soni! Priest, please save Soni! Or else she'll be doomed! Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest, please save Soni! Priest, please save her or else Soni will be ruined. - Priest! - Daughter, I couldn't get you. Priest, the stranger was falsely implicated... yesterday due to my mistake. Today, today the Queen has forced Soni to garland Shango. Priest, please save her! Priest, please save her or else love will get murdered! Priest... Oh heart, please don't cry as it can't change destiny Is it that the wishes come true on weeping? Oh heart, don't cry I've discovered the results of falling in love with someone I did see the tyranny of fate and the action of the world Love keeps sighing and Loyalty keeps looking Oh heart, please don't cry as it can't change destiny Oh heart, I kept taking your fate towards the shore On the conviction in love and the support of hope... I didn't have the idea that it'd come across a storm Oh heart, please don't cry as it can't change destiny Oh heart, don't cry Queen, the ceremony for my daughter will be held tomorrow. I have brought a present for the occasion. Even just a blessing from you means a lot to me. Let me see what else you have got for me. Why do you act surprised? Answer me. It was her turn today... and tomorrow my daughter's love shall be murdered. All this shall happen at your behest. Do not attack Peshwa. Or else the city will be ruined! Priest, I have no idea about it! I have no idea about it! You've forgotten about the kingdom wearing the crown. You remember the sin but you... are oblivious to justice. You're committing such a crime that... you'll never be able to atone for it. The tortured souls will curse you! The broken hearts will curse you! You'll never be at peace with yourself! The sun will tell the world that the Queen... of the kingdom Shangu, was a cruel woman. She was characterless and merciless! I don't wish to hear anything. You may go. This marriage shall take place for sure! Save us! Stop this devastation! The palace has bowed! - The Queen is dead! - She's dead? Bring her back to life. Ask her to show her power today. Ask her if she can stop this storm... with the help of her army and rule. We don't have any hope from her but we do have hope from you! The kingdom can't save the city today. It can no longer save the city! Only the Gods can stop the storm. The old monk can only pray. Come. Let us all pray. Get up! Now it's time to sacrifice as prayers won't work. Who amongst you all can sacrifice himself... for the sake of the country today? Priest, I'll sacrifice myself. Stranger, you! I have loved the people here and... I've also seen my love be destroyed. My country has taught me that one should... be ready to die for the sake of one's country. Priest! Priest! I'm ready for the sacrifice. My daughter! I have the right to be sacrificed for my land! Priest, she's married and she's someone's responsibility. My body belongs to someone else. - I should be allowed to die. - Shut up! Your body, your soul and your life are in my control. You have now only one duty... to obey my orders! - And your duty is to get the innocent stranger sacrificed? - Soni! - The stranger, for whom I garlanded you! - Soni! Shangu, you have a right to my body. - My soul belongs to someone else! - Soni! You are speaking to a man! Go and sacrifice yourself for the country if you are a man! I promise you that I'll embrace your dead body! I'll spend all my life remembering you! It's right! It's right! Do as she says. Sacrifice yourself. Shangu is a coward! Shangu is a coward! Priest, I wish to die. Please get me sacrificed. Priest, would you let your daughter die in this manner? Mother Earth has summoned me today! A daughter will be sacrificed for her. Not the stranger, Priest. Priest, she hasn't seen life in totality whereas I have. No, Priest! The stranger has no right to be sacrificed! Priest, I'm not a stranger. Please garland me. No, Priest! I ask for my right! Soni! Priest, that can't be so! It's cruelty! Priest, it's an injustice. Soni! Soni! Priest! Let me know your wish before you die, my child. Priest, I'd like to say something to the stranger. You may go. What have you done? You could've let me die. Do you think I can live without you? You... you are under my oath if you kill yourself! I'll never... I'll never be away from you now! How... how can this be possible? Look... the body now belongs to someone else! It has become a barrier between the two of us. I'll do away with it and become all yours. - Soni, take me along too! - No! Two sacrifices aren't possible. Let me go, if you wish to be united with me. Let me go! Please don't stop me. Remember you once told me... That there'll be a storm the day I become a bride... and I'll get lost in that. How do I say now? The heart's broken and the voice's lost. Sing, stranger! I want to keep hearing... your voice at the time of my death. That I keep hearing your voice! Sing, stranger! Sing! Sing, stranger! Sing! Soni! Hear my last wish. Never attempt to kill yourself! Be in this very form all your life. I promise you that I'll come whenever... you call me with a broken heart. I'll come for sure! Soni! From where you have begun to move today... life's become a stranger to me You have found a destination... I couldn't even die Oh traveler to a far off place... do take me along, too Do take me along, too, as I've been left alone Oh traveler to a far off place... do take me along, too You have given me such pain that I've almost died I'm now fed up with the world You take me away from here Of what use is this world... that places no value on life Do take me along too as I've been left alone Oh traveler to a far off place... do take me along, too Do take me along, too, as I've been left alone Love's path is lonely, and the eyes don't speak The unfulfilled wishes are about to be buried There's devastation all around Do take me along too as I've been left alone Oh traveler to a far off place... do take me along, too Do take me along, too, as I've been left alone Oh traveler to a far off place... do take me along, too I've been left alone She's come. Oh traveler to a far off place... do take me along, too Do take me along, too, as I've been left alone
