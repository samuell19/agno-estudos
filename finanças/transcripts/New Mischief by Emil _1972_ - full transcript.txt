You have to feel sorry for the Svenssons in Katthult. - What a rascal for a son! - Such a hardship. Many years ago on the Katthult farm in. Lönneberga in Smaland in Sweden lived a boy called Emil. He was pulling more pranks than there are days in a year. And the residents didn't like that. - Good day! - Good day! - We organized a collection. - Oh yes? But why is that? We thought this was enough to send Emil to America. To make it a bit quieter in Lönneberga. Emil is a nice boy. We love him the way he is. Take this! No, she can't do this! You will pay for this! Stay here! Stand still! Emil! Emil! You darn rascal! You will pay for this! Stand still! Stand still! Emil! Open the door! Open it! Come on! Emil, come out! Darn rascal! How can you send Emil to America? I've never heard of such a thing. Yes, we also should think of the Americans a bit. They never harmed us! Why should we put them up with Emil? Besides, there was something in the paper... about this terrible earthquake over there in America, right? And I think it would be too much for them, if they would also get stuck with Emil. - Stop it, Lina! - Yes. Go to the stable for the milking! That's the only thing you understand. There has to be some justice! Why should the Americans have all the misery? I could swap with them sometime. I think I'll write them. You'll get our Emil, and you send us your earthquakes. Ouch! You darn rascal! Emil! Emil! Stand still! Open up! Open up! The shed could be hasped from the outside... as well as from within. From time to time, Emil was of the opinion that it would be better, to hasp it from the inside, in order to peacefully carve wood figures. Emil? Open up! Open up, I say! Sit down and think about your pranks! So that it doesn't happen again! That will do you good. I mean thinking. And wood carving doesn't hurt either. Thinking and carving will do you good. Well, carving wood figures was nothing new for Emil. He already had quite a collection of them. And if nothing else happened to him, there would certainly be more. Every evening, Emil's mother wrote his latest pranks... in a blue notebook, and with time she got... a nice little collection of these notebooks. When Emil needed money one day, he took a few notebooks... to Sunday school, because he thought... he might be able to do business with the teacher. Miss? Would you like to buy these notebooks? What am I supposed to do with this? Perhaps the other children can learn from it... not to be as bad as me. Yes, Emil knew very well what kind of rascal he was. And if he should forget it, there still was Lina, and she would always reproach him. I've never seen such a rascal before. Why is he going to Sunday school? There doesn't seem to be any effect. He doesn't go to heaven anyway. At the most, when they need someone to help with thunderstorms. Thank God I still have you, Ida! You're nice. Emil isn't always pulling pranks! No, but if he isn't doing anything, he's thinking about something new. I've never seen such a child. I don't care. I like Emil anyway. That Lina didn't particularly like Emil, you probably noticed by now. But now guess whom she liked? Yes, there he is, Alfred. Alfred, do you remember what you promised me? - What did I promise? - That we're getting married. Yes! Yes. Of course I can marry you, if you really want, but we shouldn't rush things. But definitely next year! Alfred! Well, goodbye, my beloved girlfriend! I'm going to bathe with Emil. Always Emil! Always Emil! Just you and me, Alfred. Of course, Emil! Only the two of us. Alfred liked Emil and Emil liked Alfred. After all, Alfred had taught Emil a lot. Emil wanted to be able to do everything Alfred could do. What is it, Emil? Alfred didn't need to worry. Emil never touched the snuff again. Be careful you don't knock over the pot! Anton! Anton and Emil! Supper! Now what did you do? Darn rascal! Just wait! If I catch you! Alma! Look at this! Because Emil wanted to reconcile with his father, he went with Alfred to Katthult Lake in the evening to catch crabs. There! There! - There's another one. - Yes. Look! You know what? I like to get up in the night and catch crabs with you. I thought you would. Tell me, Alfred, don't you ever scold other people? Can you tell me why you never curse? You know, to be able to properly curse, you have to be really angry. And if I am really angry I'm so terribly angry I can't get a word out. If you ask me: I'm okay with that. Father will surely be surprised when he sees... - how many crabs we have caught. - Yes, I think so, too. I'll take them right into the pantry, so that he'll see them as soon as he opens his eyes. For heaven's sake! What's wrong? I have... That darn rascal again!! Aah! Emil, come here! Emil! Emil! Now help me, Alma! Yeah yeah! Come on, Alma! Stop laughing at my misery! Emil, Emil, wake up! Come on! Wake up! Emil, wake up! You'll see something funny. - I had enough. - You have hardly eaten anything. For three days they ate crabs on the Katthult farm. It was a real treat. Emil also sold crab tails to the pastor's wife... for 25 Öre per kilo. Emil and Alfred shared the revenue. You're very skilled in business, Emil. You'll be a real business man when you grow up. On the last Wednesday of October was the autumn market in Vimmerby. All the people from Lönneberga and the other villages drove there. In this market you could meet acquaintances, look for a fiancée, get sugar bars, dance a Scottish dance, have a fight and have fun. Everyone got their money's worth. - Good morning, Alfred! - Morning! - Tonight it gets going, Alfred! - Yes. I mean with that: Today we'll do it. - Do what? - We're going to get engaged, fool. Today there will be a whole different hit. I read it in the newspaper. - You mean the comet. - Yes. - Do you think it really comes? - I suppose. If it's in the paper, it must be true. As it happened, the people of Smaland... had long been waiting for a big comet. Now it was in the paper that it would arrive on October 31. With its long tail, it might crash into Earth, and could burst into a thousand pieces. Why must the stupid thing arrive... right on Vimmerbys's market day? When I want to amuse myself! But it really doesn't matter. Maybe the comet comes in the evening, then I've done most of it. You look so nice! But of course, when you go to the market! Don't forget to feed the chickens. And the pigs. - And no cats in the living room. -Yes. You would have liked to go to the market. Nonsense! I'm not crazy. I was born here in Lönneberga, and here I will die. Are you going to die, Krösa-Maja? Well, who knows! Maybe one of the comets falls on your head. And then you're dead. Come on, Ida! I'll help you. You can sit on my lap. - So, goodbye, Krösa-Maja! - Yes, live well! I'll buy doughnuts on the market and bring you some. Yes, thank you. If I am still alive when you come back. Otherwise it doesn't matter. You'll be in good health. - You want to drive? - Yes. - You're good in driving horses. - I've learned it from Alfred too. Surely it will not be so long. Julla is old, soon she can't manage it anymore. Let's buy a new horse on the market! Buy! Always buying! Let's get a new servant, now we’re already driving to the market! I'm not serious. I was only joking. But a new horse? No. Julla will certainly make it a few more years. Then Lina will surely make it a few more years as well. Well, who knows? - I'm not sure you will. - It's good. You should try. And some of those! And a bit of that! - Can it be a bit more? - No, thank you. Listen, Emil! We're going to look at the cattle. You can watch others doing business, huh? - Are you coming too? - Yes, I'd like to. You come with me to the pastry shop and drink a coffee with me. And you and I, Ida, we'll go sell our eggs and the wool. - That will be fun, huh? - Yes. You know what, Mom? - No, tell me! - We must also buy a new notebook. - To write down Emil's pranks. - I surely won't forget that! Anton, don't forget: We're eating at Mrs. Petrell. No, I definitely won't forget. I'm not demented yet. Watch it! - Do you want to buy the heifer? - Well... I advise you to act right away. I'm still looking around a bit. What's his name? Lukas. He would go well with our Marcus. Do you think so? How old is he? A few years. You're really a nice horse, Lukas. I'd like to take you right away. The horse is really not bad. What should he cost? 300. Isn't that a bit much? For such a nice little horse it's cheap. - Well. I'd pay 250. - No. - So how much? - 300. Oh, if only Emil had 300 crowns! And where is daddy? Emil knew that it would be just as difficult... to get 300 crown from his father... as if trying to elicit it from a rock. Emil tugged and plucked at all sorts of people, of whom he thought they might be his father. But when they turned around, it was never Anton Svensson from Katthult farm. Is there anybody who knows this little worm? My father suddenly disappeared. Emil! Where have you been all this time, darn rascal? Do you have to go your own way? We can talk about it later. Come! There's a horse you must see! A horse? I don't want to buy a horse. You’re crazy. Come on! Just look at it! That doesn't cost anything. Okay. Let's go have a look! - One... two... three hundred. - Okay. - That's it. - Thanks. - Is the horse good-natured? - Yes, it is good-natured! Why isn't it shod? It is only three years old, so shoes don't matter. - It has to get horseshoes. - Yes, I understand. - Surely there is a farrier here? - Of course. Well, come on! But Emil! Why are you crying? We couldn't have bought the horse anyway. It was way too expensive for us. 300 crown, Emil. You understand that, don't you? Emil. So, and now we go over to the market! I'll buy you a whole bag full of sugar candies. No matter what they cost. Alfred! Alfred, you're really impossible! Everybody gets engaged. Yes! There are enough people doing stupid things. But there are also some who think first. - And I belong to those. - Yes, but we're still engaged. So buy me a ring! No, I'd better invite you to coffee. Well, sometimes you're getting a kiss, too! That's it! That's enough. What! I'm not buying the ring. But we're engaged! - Yeah, well, but... Ah! There are the farmer and Emil. - So, take care! - You as well. - It seemed like yesterday. Alfred! You can believe me, Alfred. The horse I have seen, Lukas, is exactly the horse we should have now. - No. - Yes! Some fat uncle bought it. I'll never see it again. I think you feel sorry. I sure do. Emil... I'll buy something for you. - You want an ocarina? Come. - Yes. Emil got his ocarina, and he started to feel a bit better... and forgot to be sad. You can buy an ocarina. Well... Lina tried 17 times to take me into the shop down there. For what? You understand why! If I hadn't resisted, who knows what would have happened. - When the comet comes. - Do you want that? It get rid of what it does. Now be happy. Do you want an ocarina? - No, thanks. - Lina! Alfred and Lina are going to see Markus and Jullan to eat their packed lunch. - Do you want some sandwiches? - No, we'll eat with Mrs. Petrell. Where is daddy? No, not again! I didn't see him leave. Next time I'm going to town, he has to stay home. Mrs. Petrell was a distinguished lady. It was strange that she had dinner. It wasn't because Emil's mother brought good sausage with her. They'd have leftovers of yesterday's fish pudding and blueberry soup. Welcome! How nice! Hello! Hello everyone! Please come in! Come in! That's nice. We haven't seen each other for so long. Come in! Mrs. Petrell, there I have... Yes, I brought you some sausage. - Hopefully you'll like it. - Oh! Nice! But that wasn't necessary. I'm very pleased. So, you little one? Hey... where is Emil? If we only knew! He's a darn rascal. It's easier to guard a sack of fleas. They don't disappear so quickly. Opposite of Mrs. Petrell was the mayor's house. Gottfried, his son, was walking on stilts in the front garden. When two young boys meet for the first time, and are so much alike, then they only have to look at each other... to understand each other immediately. I'd like to have a cap like you. Will you lend it to me? No, I need it myself. But I'd like to borrow your stilts. Can I get them? Yes, but I hardly believe that you can go on them. It's difficult. Do you think you can go over the fence with those? I don't think so, but you can try. One spoon of blueberry soup. I'm so nervous today! I am really quite beside myself. But why? Didn't you read about the comet? You must have heard of it? Yes, we did. So, today it will come. The whole town's in turmoil. Ah, Lord in heaven! When I think about it, this is perhaps the last blueberry soup of my life. Then it's probably better if I get a bit more, just in case. Aah! The comet! Emil! Darn rascal! I'll lock you up in the shed for a week. - Come! We must help her. Get cold water! - Where? We have to wet her face. Come on, hurry! Go to the kitchen! Certainly there's cold water there. Wait, I'll help you! Don't act like a fool! Find a jar and a rag! Why does it take that long? Just a bit of water! Poor Mrs. Petrell! Let's see if this helps! You can see how good it is to have a lot of blueberry soup. It also helps with such an accident. We don't need water anymore! I already cured her! Emil! Darn rascal!! Now I'm sure... who'll spend longer in the shed. What kind of darned kid are you? Anton! What? You rascal! You look clean again. The dirt in your ears is hardly from just before, right? You can get dressed again. Shall I help you? No, stay away! Heaven forbid! Get him out of my sight. - Don't come back till we go home! - But Anton! And don't destroy Vimmerby! If possible, don't get into trouble! Even in the Sahara Desert you would... find something to break. Anton! Anton! Anton! Market day would soon be over. People in the streets were laughing and talking... and kept on screaming. Today was a special day. Firstly today was the mayor's birthday, and also the comet would arrive. It's terrible how the horse behaves! I've shod a lot of horses, but never one like this. Just do your work! We'll hold the horse. Okay, give me the shoe! What's this? - Stop it! - You'll never manage. I must say! - You got quite a deal! - What the hell! The horse behaved just like Lina, when she got tickled, Emil thought. It doesn't want to be shod. The have tried in Tuna at least 20 times. Why didn't the farmer tell me before? If he had told you, you wouldn't have bought it. I'm going to sue the man. What shall I do with the mare? Whoever wants can have her. I'll take the horse! You little brat? You'd be killed before you can call your mom. He didn't want to give the horse away, but since so many had heard, he had to try... to get out of this self-imposed trap. Well, you can get it, but under one condition: You have to hold it so that we can shod it. I will not tickle you. That's a solid promise. Do you understand? I won't touch your leg. Only the hoof. And that was just the point: The horse was indeed ticklish. If one didn't touch the ticklish spots, it would surely remain still and let itself be shod on all hoofs. I will surely not tickle you and only hold the hoof. I also keep my promises. I'll only touch you by the hooves. Do you understand? Do you really think it understands? You think it'll go better? You'll see. No, don't boy! You could be kicked to death. - Don't you hear what I say? - For heaven's sake, what are you doing? You can shod it. I'm holding it. Incredible! I've never seen anything like it. Look at this! The boy knows more about horses than you. Even though you are a horse trader. When the horse had got horseshoes on all four hooves, the horse-dealer became uneasy. He wouldn't have dreamt of it. - That should be enough. - Oh, no, better put that back! - You promised the horse to the boy. - But that is impossible. The boy gets the horse. What is said is said. Well. Then just take it! Take it! Heck, take it and get out, so I don't have to see the both of you anymore! My horse. My horse. My Lukas. Gottfried, come here! Hurry up! I'll show you something! - Whose horse is that? - It's mine. - You're lying. - No, I'm telling the truth. My father said I was too small to have a horse. - I don't think you're too small. - But he said it. There's not a boy of my age who has a horse, he says. This is great! It is. Your daddy should see this. Yes, he should, but how can I show him a horse, when he only sits in the house and parties? He never comes out. I understand. We have to think of something else. But what? But when they say that I'm Vimmerby's greatest inhabitant, and always have been... it seems to me a bit exaggerated. Nevertheless: I must confess,... that I am very moved by what was said. My dear friends, I lift my glass and drink to all your health. So what do you say now? Now you see that some boys do have horses. If you have ever attended a party, where a horse suddenly appeared, then you also know that there are always a few people, who wince as if they never saw a horse. - Is this horse yours? - Certainly. - It's pretty. - Yes, a beautiful horse. They all couldn't help laughing. And then Emil remembered that he had to go back to Lönneberga. See you, Gottfried! I must go home now. Yes, it's certainly better... before my father comes out from under the cream again. Tonight we'll have a great fireworks show. Look at how many fireworks we have! I would also like to see such a fireworks. I've never seen one of these. We could try one. - Do you think they'll work? - Shall we try? Just the small one here. Careful! They all explode! Help! Fire! Help! Call the fire brigade! - The comet! - Oh, help! The comet is coming! The comet! Now I've finally seen real fireworks! Yes, now you've finally seen real fireworks! Hey, hop, father, see how well Emil can ride! Emil's father was very pleased with his Emil. He had scared the whole of Vimmerby... but he had gotten a horse for free. No one in Lönneberga had a boy like him. Emil's father was so happy, that he had forgotten about the incarceration. Here is the master of Katthult farm. A very special man he is! You're in a good mood today. Do you like me, we ride because then I feel free. Hop little horse, hop little horse You take the tail, the tail is still there. So far and air an dust and boom-boom you're on it. (nonsense song) It was getting more and more autumnal. The days were gray and darker in Katthult... and all Lönneberga and throughout Smaland. Pooh devil! Lina didn't like to go to the barn at five in the morning in the dark. Yes, yes, yes. I'm coming! Are you fooling me now? Then my sun goes out. Then anxiety breaks my heart. Nowhere on earth, from pole and to pole I find someone to comfort me. Lina thought autumn was comfortless but some things she liked. These included the catechism tests. Is it true that we have entered the Catechism? - Will WE be tested? - Uh-huh. A week from Saturday. Learn how to answer correctly! I really like them, these catechism examinations. But I don't like all questions equally. Sometimes I just don't know what to answer. As for biblical history, you're not particularly good. But the pastor knows that and just asks you easy questions. Yes, hopefully he does. What Lina liked best of the test was the good food. And she wasn't the only one. All community members were invited, also the poor from the poorhouse. You don't know about catechism exams. Earlier, one had to know what was said in the Bible and the Catechism, The pastor had to examine now and then what they knew. Do you have to interrogate me? Isn't it enough when the pastor does? You always say it wrong. Now listen! "Just as we love and fear our Lord, we also fear our husband." Let's see if I can! How we love... our wife... love and fear... Oh, you mix it all up! "And God said, 'Let us make man as our image!'" "And so God created first the man and he called him Adam." "Then he created the woman, and called her Eve." "And so Eve became the mother of all living." "God blessed them and commanded them, 'Be fruitful and multiply!'" "'Fulfill the earth and make it subject to you!'" He had been talking about Adam and Eve for a long time. That they were the first people, that they lived in paradise, and of course he was convinced... that everyone had understood him. Well, Lina, who were our first ancestors? Thor and Freya. Emil's mother was ashamed. Tor and Freja were old gods that people... believed in a thousand years ago before they heard about the Bible. But Lina, don't you remember that the first people were Adam and Eve? Yes, I know. And God created them according to His image. That's how it was, I know. Right, Lina. That's right. First he created the man, and then? Then he took a rib-eye and made the woman out of it. No, Lina, he didn't take a rib-eye. But a rib. Yes, of course, it... it was like that. You have been created as the image of God too, Lina. Have you ever thought about it? Yes... but not very often. But you are God's miracle. Don't you see it's a miracle that he created you? Yes, that may be. Well, I mean to make just me was probably not that special. At best... the many squiggles in the ears, they were certainly difficult to make. Emil's mother thought that all the inhabitants of Katthult farm should be ashamed because Lina gave such stupid answers. Emil! Thor and Freya! You'll be a heathen forever, that's for sure. They're mixing everything up. Why am I supposed to straighten up everything? Supper will be ready soon. Yes, I see. What an abundance of blessings! Biblical history is important... but you are more concerned with meatballs, salad and cheese cake! All in good time, Anton! The catechism in its time and the cheesecake in its time. Yes, it was time to do honor to the cheese cake. - That was a good cheesecake. - I'm happy it did taste. Emil, be so nice and go close up the chicken coop. But come back soon! Some more cream? Here's a nice piece of bread, Lukas. My good horse! No, I have nothing left for you. But later you'll get a real treat from me. Beyond the pig house lay the privy. Yes, that's what it was called at that time. The finer name was Trisseboda, named after the man who built it. ♫ Everything is locked. Everything is locked. ♫ ♫ It's all locked. ♫ Emil? Emil! Emil! Hey! ♫ Everything is locked. Everything is locked. ♫ ♫ Now everything is locked. ♫ Emil! I could have guessed. The pocket knife is of course in my work-clothes! Emil! Sooner or later someone must come here. But I'm already sorry for him. The first one who comes here, I'll kill him. This was really very unfair of Emil's father and not nice at all. However, you have to consider how angry he was. Now I am of the opinion that it's the task of the community, to carry out the necessary repairs at the vicarage as soon as possible. And the poorhouse has to be renovated too, but the problem is not so urgent. Do you know these galoshes? Do you know who the galoshes belong to? These are the pastors. And that's why... So, there you could... I want to get out. Even when I have to force myself through the hole up there! I'm bursting with rage. If you're just really angry, everything goes! What's a church elder doing when half his body is... outside in the rain and the other half in the toilet? Is he crying for help? No, because he knows the Lönnebergers. And he knows that discovery of his condition... would cause such tremendous mockery in Smaland, that it would haunt him his whole life. I don't like this catechism food. I do. Because it's good for the pigs. They'd never get such good food otherwise. Emil? Go get Alfred immediately! Tell him to bring a kilo of dynamite! So I can blow up this whole outhouse, understood? Come right away and bring a kilo of dynamite if you have it! - What? - Come! That was really a pity! Emil's father had obviously not meant it about the dynamite. But it turned out they had to saw him out. It was the only way. Just wait until I'm outside! This will be no fun for you, I can assure you. Why do you stand there with the umbrella? So it doesn't rain on you. That doesn't matter. I'm already soaking wet. I'll catch a cold. I'm sure I'll get pneumonia. You won't get a cold. The main thing is that you keep your feet dry. Yes, the main thing is that you keep your feet dry. That's true. This will be over soon. Oh, oh, oh...! Now you!!! Emil! You will pay for this! Stand still! Stand still! Emil! Emil! Stop! Are you gonna open up? I don't hear a thing! Where have you been? We'll talk about that later. Thanks for the nice day. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. We thank our hosts for today. Thank you. So, this is mine. - I knew it wouldn't fit. - I can't help it. You have to be patient! I won't go to Katthult any time soon. Well then, goodbye! Adieu! And thank you. I'll never set foot in Katthult ever again! And certainly not in galoshes! Nevertheless, life went on at Katthult. Emil! And everything remained the same. In the evening everyone sat together in the kitchen, everyone doing their own. Aah! Darn! - What? Did you cut yourself? - Is it bad? Anyway it won't get better when you curse. I don't want to hear a curse, not in my house. Wait a moment, Alfred! I'll help you right away. So... We're almost there. But it was bleeding bad. So now! Well, now I can... I can certainly carve again. Alfred and Emil were busy... carving new prongs for the rake. All broken pieces had been replaced, and in spring everything was all fixed again. Leave Lina in peace! You're just keeping her from work. Then whom am I supposed to tickle? It must be someone who's ticklish. Yes. I'm certainly the one. You can say that. The first snow fell just before Christmas. Of all the ghosts I have seen, the ghost in the parsonage was the worst. It stood in the dark on the parsonage roof... without a head. Neither do you! I told you not to scare the children! But, tell me! Did the ghost really have no head? No. And now I say no more. It's snowing. Look at this! And besides, we have a north wind. There will probably be bad weather. How am I going to get there? That's what I ask myself. Stay the night over! Sleep on the sofa with Lina! Then you'll have to lie stiff as a corpse. I'm ticklish. Don't move yourself, knuckle-head! What's with you? Aren't you feeling well? My thumb hurts so much. What, still? Hasn't it gotten any better? I'll take the bandage off. God forbid! How it looks! This is blood poisoning! That's terribly dangerous. Is it really blood poisoning? No. It doesn't seem so bad. But it doesn't look good either. I'll make you a fresh bandage. Well, but if it isn't better by tomorrow, Alfred, then you go over to Mariannelund... - and show your finger to the doctor. - This is blood poisoning. Blah, blah. The other day, you said I had consumption. Yes, that's what it looked liked. Your lungs rattled so much that you heard it everywhere. That night everywhere in Smaland it stormed and snowed. Alfred can shovel snow all day. Or he can forget about it, it doesn't help anyway. Where is Alfred, by the way? Why doesn't he come and eat? Yes, he is always so punctual when it comes to food. He is not seriously ill, is he? A clever boy, Emil, shoveling snow on his own. You never know how you suddenly need him. Silly Lina! She had no idea that Emil was on his way to Alfred. - Is that you, Emil? - Yes. Man, it's cold in here! Why didn't you light the fire? Is something wrong with you? Alfred! I... I don't know. Aren't you coming for breakfast? I'm not hungry. Now Emil got really worried. If Alfred wasn't hungry, then it had to be serious. After Emil had made a fire in the fireplace, he ran into the house to get his mother. But then they all came to Alfred, because they were very worried about him. For heaven's sake, what does it look like? I say it is a blood poisoning! I told you! When the red line reaches the heart, it’s over with him, he'll die. - Alfred. - Will you be quiet, Krösa-Maja? It was exactly the same with Johannes. He simply died from such a blood poisoning. And it was the same with the maid. - A blood poisoning and she was gone. - Are you going to stop? Oh Jesus! Alfred. No, we won't give up! There is a cure, there is. - But how? - You take hairs from him and a shred of his shirt... and bury everything at midnight on the north side of the house. You're crazy! One has to say an incantation formula: "Toi, toi, toi, when the devil sends pain and misery, send it back to him again!" It is enough that Alfred cursed, as he did when he hurt his thumb. And if something has got to be buried there, then do it yourself! No, then I can't help either. What's with the old woman's talk? It's about that he gets better. Yes, Emil, he'll get well. Certainly he will. Of course you'll get better, Alfred, I'm sure about that. But I don't understand how they'll get the coffin through the door? You must take Alfred to the doctor in Mariannelund. - Like Mother said. - But that just doesn't work. - It will! - Not in this weather. - Yes! - No, believe me! You have to believe that we want to help Alfred as best we can. But you can see how much snow there is. I don't care about that. You make me cry for not wanting to help. He can't just lie there and die! - But no! We hope he doesn't. - Then get him to the doctor! I said we can't, all right? I thought we'd get married in the spring! But goodbye to it because Alfred is dying! Here I sit with four sheets and a dozen towels! - If that doesn't make you cry! - Yes, I understand. - Mum? - It's really not possible, Emil. You have to believe me. Now it was clear to Emil: It was impossible to get help. Emil sat with Alfred all day. It was the longest day in his life! There you are, Emil. How Emil hated this snow! He hated it so hot it could have melted all the snow... in Lönneberga, and Smaland. But it looked more like... the whole world would drown in the snow. Emil. How are you, Alfred? I brought you some meat soup. No thanks. I don't want anything. Come on Alfred! At least one spoon! You can not lie there and starve before our eyes. No thanks. I can't get anything down my throat. Just let me! But you should eat some of the soup, Emil. Oh, mother, what can we do about Alfred? Oh, Emil! I wish I knew. But I don't know either. Alfred! Alfred! Poor Alfred! Are you conscious? Just leave him alone! You have to go to bed. I came over to get you. But I don't want to go to my bed. I'll sleep here on the floor next to Alfred. And so it came to pass. Emil got himself an old mattress and a horse blanket. He didn't need more to sleep. Just come in, cat! Hour by hour passed, and Emil more and more felt that something should happen. Soon it would be too late, forever too late. And then, around 4 in the morning, Emil knew what to do. Alfred couldn't stay in his bed... and just die, no, that should not be! Now we're going to the doctor, Alfred. Do you hear me? Emil had to be away before anyone woke up and stopped him. Only an hour was left for the preparations. No one knows how he managed it. Now I'm in control. Do you hear, Lukas? We have to hurry, or Lina will wake up. Giddy-up, Lukas! Snow everywhere. Lukas had already been to Mariannelund several times. Perhaps deep inside his horse's memory he still knew the way. Run, Lukas! Go! Go! Emil felt strong like a little ox, He would never forget how often he had to shovel snow. If you have to be strong, then you are strong, do you understand that, Lukas? Maybe father was right when he said: It's not possible, Emil. You know that. We must go on, Lukas! We just have to! Go, Lukas! Pull! Go on, Lukas! Pull! Are you still alive, Alfred? No, I'm probably already dead. There are stables up front. I run and get help, Alfred. Where for heaven's sake are you coming from? No child should be outside in this weather. Can you please help me? I've got Alfred on the sled, and he's very... ill. We are stuck in a ditch. Where is your father? Certainly you're not alone. Well, I'm alone. Alfred is so sick! Ah, I'll help you then. Thank you for helping me! But Lukas is at his end, he can't go on anymore. So I ask you: Can I borrow your horse for the last bit to Mariannelund? In this terrible snow drift you have to keep your horse. I can't any longer, Alfred! Alfred! Are you dead, Alfred? Just us, Alfred. Do you know if the road to Mariannelund is cleared? If you hurry, it is. Soon, it's probably the same misery again. So hurry up! - The next, please! - Doctor! Alfred is lying outside dying! Gunnar, Erik, come and help me! You guys and women, go! I have something else to do. Now Emil was really scared. If it was too late, after all? If there were no more salvation for Alfred? I'll give you all I've got if you make him well. You'll also get my horse. Do you think you can? Keep your horse and everything else! I'm doing all I can, anyway. But I can't promise you anything. Oh! There you are, Emil! Yes, Emil is here. But it would be better if he leaves for a bit. I've to cut Alfred a bit. I think he's a bit scared. - Perhaps it would be better if I stayed with him. - Yes. If you managed to get him here, then you'll manage here, I'm sure. And so Emil took Alfred's good hand and held it fast, while the doctor sliced the other arm. Alfred gave no sound. He neither screamed nor cried. Only Emil cried a little. But so quietly that nobody noticed. Just us, Alfred. Yes, the two of us. You and I, Emil. Can you go home again, Alfred? Yes. - You should thank Emil for that. - I already did. I've always liked the boy. Strange, there are people who have something against him! There's hardly a boy who never does anything. Mother! Emil and Alfred are coming! Yeah, yeah! Now they were all quiet. Now everyone in Lönneberga knew what a hero Emil was. Now no one wanted to send him to America anymore. There's Emil! And Alfred! For real? Thank God! Father! Father, they are here! Emil and Alfred. Praise and thanks our Lord! After the awful awakening, when father discovered in the morning, that Emil and Alfred had disappeared... it was so hard on his stomach that he had to go to bed. At first he thought, he would never see his boy again. Then the news came, that Emil had arrived safely in Mariannelund, but the stomach pains remained even after Emil came home. I'm back, daddy. Yes. I can see you. You're really a good boy, Emil. Yes, we have him back, our Emil. Are you very ill, daddy? No, it's just a little stomach pain. I've put a warm pot lid on it. Yes, with a belly pain... there's nothing better than a warm pot lid. It should be warmed up again. I can do that. I now know how to care for the sick. - Then give me a glass of juice! - I will. You can take a close look, if you want. This is certainly the strangest thumb of Lönneberga. You don't need to be proud of that. Such a blood poisoning can take long. The worst thing is that you'll stay ill long, although the disease is over. Yes, yes, you can believe me. The doctor said you can get consumption. Oh, I almost forgot! The doctor gave me a letter. Did he? "You have a boy you should be proud of", stood in the letter. Later, Emil's mother wrote in one of her blue notebooks: This was such a comfort to my poor mother-heart, which so often has been desperate about Emil. Oh, my little one! So, if you don't have blood poisoning now, can we get married in the spring? - So... I don't promise you that. I still have this thumb. Maybe I'll get blood poisoning. If you ever get it again, I'll bury you on the north side of the house. I won't go to Mariannelund again. Be careful what you say! Yes, you! Now, daddy! You bird of ill omen! How hot did you make the lid? I thought if it should work, it must be as hot as an iron. Wait, Anton! I'll get you some ointment. Not necessary. I'd rather get up. Because now Emil is back, nobody can be really ill in this house! Subtitles by Subransu
