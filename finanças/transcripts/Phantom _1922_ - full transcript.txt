The reconstruction was carried out in 2002/2003 by Luciano Berriat√∫a and Camille Blot-Wellens on behalf of the Friedrich-Wilhelm- Murnau-Stiftung in Wiesbaden. The basis was a camera negative and a dupe negative from the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, Berlin. Most of the intertitles were obtained from the flash titles on the original negative. The missing intertitles were restored by referring to the shooting script. The newly appended titles are recognisable by way of the Friedrich-Wilhelm- Murnau-Stiftung (FWMS) logo. The reconstruction of the hues was made possible by tinting the negatives. Laboratory work: L'Immagine Ritrovata, Bologna In 2008, an export copy was discovered in the Cineteca Nacional de Chile in Santiago. In 2013, the tinting was revised and inconsistencies in the reconstruction rectified, for the 2K digital version. Based on the novel of the same name, from the Berliner lllustrirten Zeitung adapted for the film by Thea Von Harbou FIRST ACT. What were you just thinking about, Lorenz? About my former life.... Write the story of your life in this book, which Father himself bound for you. Do you think the memory will be less agonising then? I, former convict Lorenz Lubota, hereby write down, as my dear wife Marie wills it so, the story of my guilt and my atonement. Melanie doesn't have any time for this - does she?. Call Lorenz. Always you with your books, Lorenz. With the amount of money you earn even God doesn't know how you could be able to afford them. Just let me have my poor books, Mother. At the very least they provide one with dreams of all the things one will never experience. Isn't it time for you to get to art-school, Hugo? I'll be coming home a bit later today. I want to help Aunt Schwabe with some accounts. I don't want you to have anything to do with her - with that... usurious witch. She's gotten fat and rich off her cut-throat business. And I, I've slaved away my whole life like a horse. The neighbours. Lorenz should be getting here soon, at this point. It seems to me, my child, that you divide your day up into Lorenz's comings and goings. Does Lorenz know that? ...hold onto your heart, Marie. Once Lorenz wakes up from his dream world. Here are a few poems I've done, Father Starke. I'd like to hear what you think of them... Well well, now you of all people are wishing to tread among the poets. Please, don't hold me up.. I have to go to work. What kind of work is it that you do anyway? Where did you get those silky rags?. Where have you been running around night after night? Get a grip on yourself, Mother. You're rid of me now. I have no desire to wither away and rot in this miserable hole. I can stand on my own two feet. I don't need anybody's help. Misery, hunger, poverty - everything's coming down on me. And now disgrace too. Can't Lorenz Lubota ever get to work on time?. The good Lord in a fit of wrath made Lorenz Lubota town clerk. Well - take care, Mother. Melanie... where you're headed... there's no way back. What do you want here? Why are you running after our dear girl? END OF THE FIRST ACT. SECOND ACT. So, I'm telling you, Marie... This Lorenz, who would have thought of it. This is more than talent - this is genius. Mist- Mister Lubota. Professor, old Starke doesn't just throw his support behind anyone, but Lorenz Lubota - that's a genius. Are you the one, Muse, / Who takes me in her service, / And like the Sphinx / Tears with her claws from my breast / My song? Lorenz... Are you ill?.. Have you already found out - ? From your sister - ? How ugly... how terribly ugly it all is - . I want to go get a little fresh air... maybe - that will put me more at ease. You, sir - man - lad, do you know you're a genius?. I gave your poems to a man who would consider it an honour to be your mentor. One fine day, at the hall where you were once a lowly clerk, you'll be made an honorary citizen of our town. Do you really think... that I'm a poet? That I could be a great and eminent man. I think that now the boy realises he's a poet, he's losing his head. What's the name of the daughter in this house here? I can't give you anything more, child... I've got nothing myself. Either the money - or the pawn-ticket. Rules are rules in this world. This must be your first experience with Schwabe. as you think you can persuade the old bird by pleading?. You know Mr Wigottschinsky, Lorenz - don't you? Pretend I'm not here; act like you would in your own home. I gave a number of poems that I composed in my spare time to an excellent judge of literature - a certain Mr. Starke, to read. Now he wants to introduce me to a well-known publisher who's supposed to print my poems. My boy, you might very well become quite the famous man. How can an old hand such as you be so far off the mark in your judgement. The poems are nice enough... but they are certainly not, and never will be, publishable material. Now I don't dare go to the publisher... with my shabby suit. Considering your impending fame, you do look pretty shabby... We'll just have to help fix that for you. The old screw seems to have taken a fancy to you. It's usually hard to swindle her. I think I'll accompany our poet to look for some new clothes. I'm something of an expert there. Will you come back again? This so-called professor claims Lorenz's poems have no merit. Yes, but... what will Lorenz say about that? No, no - my good fellow - we must drink to the beginning of this promising literary career. Where on earth is Lorenz?. ...and why on earth isn't Melanie here yet? First off, champagne. Even if we lose all the money - the old lady has more in the cash-box. Cheers, poet. I'll look at whomever I please. You've made a conquest, Lubota. He's my brother - Have you heard, old Harlan wants to have his daughter Veronika engaged to rich Wiedenberg. Is that true what you've just said, - about Veronika Harlan's engagement? END OF THE SECOND ACT. THIRD ACT. Say there, little one - your brother Lorenz - he's tight with old Schwabe, isn't he?. My brother Lorenz is the most upright man in the world - and the only one my Aunt Schwabe doesn't consider a scoundrel. We would like to enquire as to why the town clerk Lubota has been away from work without an excused absence. My son is sickly... We have received complaints against the 'sickly' Mr Lubota, who's been carousing in bars and making a scandalous scene in front of the Harlan residence. According to the coachman you're supposed to have followed Miss Veronika once already - You used to be town clerk, Mr. Lubota? Do you have any idea, Father, where Lorenz is today? I'm in no hurry to tell him what failures his poems are. Now for God's sake, Lorenz, what's going on with Harlan? Mother... last night... - the whole world around me has fallen apart. If you love me, Mother, don't ask. I have no time to lose. I have to get to the Harlans. If I only knew how I could get your brother to pull the wool over the old screws eyes. I've told you once already. Leave my brother out of it. He's above all of this. Madame... is it true... that you wish your daughter to be engaged to Mr Wiedenberg? I know I have no say in this matter. Nevertheless - for God's sake... have pity. Give me an answer. Call my husband in. Madame... I saw your daughter only once... But I can't go on any longer - without the hope of someday acquiring her for myself. Don't consider me a fool, Madame. This love overtook me like fate. To give up on it would be like - giving up on God. Don't you want to tell me what's on your mind, Mother Lubota? Is Lorenz ill? I don't know what's happened to him. He's no longer my Lorenz at all. He's a stranger that I don't know - who doesn't know me. How can one have doubts about Lorenz, even for a minute, Mother. I take my leave, Mr. Harlan, without the assurance that you will support my courting your daughter... It would be an honour, Mr Lubota, after some time, let's say a year from now - to discuss this matter further... To the best tavern in the city. Forgive me... please... an almost unbelievable resemblance... You may stay... if you like. We were just on our way in any case. Champagne - . I'd like to drink some champagne. Tell me, Marie, do you think it's possible... that Lorenz could go astray? No, Father. What I meant to say... Lorenz Lubota is developing his poetic genius. He only moves in the best circles now. What that boy could become - if only he had money. He'd only need money... just money. Don't. Don't. Don't you too run - from me. Not you too. Who are you? I am - a town clerk down on his luck. Don't tell this joke in front of my mother, or she'll throw you out. Tell me who you are. I... am a poet... a man with no luck... chasing after a shadow... a phantom. I want to know... what drove you to me, like a sleepwalker... I want to know who you think you're kissing... when you're kissing me.? END OF THE THIRD ACT. FOURTH ACT. My daughter and I are, unfortunately, destitute... You understand me, don't you? Melitta let slip that you're a well-known poet... I hope your income corresponds to your fame. You're right... one has to pay... There is a price for everything. My son isn't home... Mr Lubota doesn't need to bother coming to the town hall - He's free of that concern. Love at first sight, brother-in-law. - you know how it is. Children, if we stuck together and had the right threads - we'd make for setting up a splendid business. I... need money. My dear child, I don't concern myself with your love affairs; be so good as not to interfere with my business affairs. The only person we can tap is old Schwabe, that's for sure. - What if Lorenz put the royalties on his poetry up as collateral? Well, my boy, if you pass yourself off as a poet, you have to pay the consequences - or else do without the support of a gullible aunt. The Extortion. Only you can help me, Aunt Schwabe. The world is closed to those who come with empty hands. People are scoundrels, Lorenz... each and every one of them. I only trust one... That's you. This boy here, - he wouldn't get a penny from me. But you... you shall have the money. I can't stand this... I don't want this. I'm no scoundrel. Then expose the whole swindle and remain a nothing and a starveling your entire life - . And - her? From Miss Anna Schwabe 60,000 marks are certified to be paid - The practical application... I'd like to speak with Lorenz. You've come to the wrong place. For days now I've had no idea where Lorenz is at. Now let's go shopping. A hundred thousand things to buy - . You don't seem well... I thought Lorenz took better care of you. To Mr Lorenz Lubota, It is a fact that you have been away from work without an excused absence, but you have frequented and behaved scandalously in a questionable tavern and, further, you have harassed highly esteemed citizens of the town. - Moreover your unqualified behaviour toward civil-servant Hermann Schaat is considered a serious offence against a public administrator. As such, you are dismissed from this day forward, without claim to further wages. What do you really want? Why are you prying on me? You've never once shown any concern for me - why today all of a sudden?. What do I want here - ? I loaned Lorenz 60,000 marks - and now I'd like to know what he's using it for. My Lorenz is an honest man. What my Lorenz does, he can answer for. Bear that in mind - and leave me be. I want to know where I stand. I'll be making enquiries... in any case you can tell Lorenz that I expect him at my place today. I'd like to buy this piece for my mother. The founding of the Wigottschinsky-Lubota firm calls for a celebration. I brought something for you, Mother. Did you buy that with the money from your Aunt Schwabe? She was here... she was asking about you... you have to go see her today... Why did you want to talk to me, Aunt? Lorenz, you are the biggest scoundrel that I've ever come across in my entire life. I've made some enquiries... I now know where I stand with you. I demand back the money you swindled me out of. ...and if you don't have the money anymore, as you claim - where did you spend it? I owe you no explanation of how and where I spend my money. Your money? - You dare talk about your money? What's come over you? Have you been suddenly taken over by the devil? Either you give me back the money - or I'll have no qualms about handing you and your fine friend over to the police. I'll give you three days to clear the matter up completely; not an hour longer. If you haven't done it by then, I'm turning you over to the police. END OF THE FOURTH ACT. FIFTH ACT. She's given everything away... she's been to see Mother... When she thinks her money's in danger, the old beast knows no pity. She'll break your neck without mercy. You'll just have to pull the wool over her eyes a second time, - and if you have to - with force. I'd rather stand in the square and admit my mistakes in front of everyone and do penance. Do you think that will get the money back? I'll pay the money back. I'll pay back every last penny. From what? From your income as a discharged clerk - or from the royalties from your poetry? I can't break free from her. Don't you see I'm on the brink of madness? Then help me. Why aren't you helping me? If I could help you... if I could save you... then I wouldn't love you anymore... The disorderly day... The grey day... Mother is very ill... I have to run to the chemists quick. Mother... I've come to you. Help me. There outside... it's my son. Your mother is very ill, Lorenz... We have to keep her away from any excitement. I'm giving you three days' time... not an hour longer.. Marie... I have to ask you something... Marie... what would you say... if someone told you... that I've turned into a scoundrel? I would laugh at him, Lorenz. But if he were right, Marie? The final attempt... I have to talk with you, Aunt... Aunt... I beg you... have mercy... I can't give you back the money now... And I can't tell you where it went. Then the police will have to concern themselves with this matter. You can ask the gentleman who discovered your talent to post bail for you... or you can sign your future royalties over to me... But none of that's at all true. It's all lies. Nobody would even give me 50 marks for my ten measly poems. Yes.. I lied to you. But I don't want to lie anymore - no more. You would have been better off if you kept lying, you fool. Then maybe I would have deferred your debt. But now - To what end - .? I can well imagine what kind of slut you threw my good money at, but I'll have the police as much on that woman's throat as they are on yours. Where is Lorenz? I don't know, Mother... he'll be back soon. Now you have no other choice. When the whole affair comes to light, you'll go to jail and it'll be the death of your mother. Agreed, then... tomorrow night... END OF THE FIFTH ACT. SIXTH ACT. The black day... Do you have the money?. I don't want to hear anything about business right now; right now I want to have a nice dinner with you. Cheers, old lady, live it up. Who's making so much noise going back and forth? Won't you go to sleep, Lorenz, it's 2 o'clock. We're lost... Both of us are lost... gone to ruin. Can you tell me where this addressee lives? The house number isn't clear. Damn it all. The old lady's night bell. Don't. You don't need to handcuff me... I'll go with you willingly. Don't ask any questions; be good to mother. Farewell. Atonement... ...and redemption. We've been waiting, Lorenz, to bring you home. Look, Lorenz - your new homestead. But I have the consolation that my good mother died in the firm belief that I was a sick man. A letter from your sister, Lorenz. Life toyed with me like life toys with a rudderless boat. Now I've reached dry land, far away. Think of me with love, as I think of you. Did Father's book fulfil its duty? Yes, Marie.
