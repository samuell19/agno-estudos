Subtitles by explosiveskull There's no easy way to say this, Wesley. I'm just gonna come out with it. I think that's best. Your mother and I have considered all of the possibilities available to us, um, vis-à-vis our relationship difficulties. And... And in the current emotional climate, we feel... Clay, can you just get on with it? Right. Mommy and Daddy are splitting up, pal. Hey. Hey. That's what I don't want. I don't want you blaming yourself. It has nothing to do with you. Wesley, I know that you are so tired of hearing us argue, and that is why this is the right thing for us to do. Yeah. We both love you very much. I mean, you're still the biggest star in Daddy's sky. Yeah. I'm not sure we got through to him. He's a guy. We have our own way of processing emotion. I've seen some sad sack waste of space in my life, but that scrimmage I just witnessed was the worst thing I've ever seen in my whole life. You need to pull your heads out of your rectums and start playing hockey like you mean it. You are the Wolf Pack, not the help-a-granny-across- the-street pack of boys on a hockey... That didn't make sense, but do "hard work" on three. Ready? - "Hard work" on three. One, two, three! - Hard work! Wor... All right, game face. Ready? That was terrifying, and not in a good way. - Work on it for tomorrow. - All right, guys, good practice. So it's really over, huh? Like a hundred percent done? Ice has been thin for a while, man. It finally broke. Do you mind if I pursue Olive then? Like, romantically? Could you pursue her if both your legs were broken? Off-limits? Glad we established that boundary. How are you feeling on this, man? Breakup? Let's talk about it. Uh, it's a sign from the ice hockey gods. You know what it is? It's a wake-up call I need, man, to start this year. - That's a good way to look at it. - Uh-huh. I was worried that losing someone like Olive would absolutely shatter you. Like, I thought you were gonna be a mess, you know? I'm glad your cup is half full on this one, you know? Yeah. Where you at on the grief scale? Stage two. Anger. I want to kill him. Oh, rash, but exciting. He just blindsided me. I mean, I guess it was creeping along for a while. Are my expectations off? Is it me? - Oh, don't be ridiculous. - We had a plan. It was such a good plan. Wesley and I will be fine without him. - Help me intubate this guy in four. - Okay. Nightmare on Elm Street. Mine. Get Smart. You need that. The Departed. That's appropriate. Lethal Weapon. Yes, I am. - It's a Wonderful Life. - Uh, mine. - It stays here. - No argument. E.T. Mine. Oh, Flashdance. What about these? Good times. I look good as a blond. I'll make you copies. Yeah, that'd be nice. Well, this is it for now. Well, I guess I might come back later in case I forgot something. You're still wearing your ring. Um, I'm sorry this didn't work out. Us. Yeah, me too. Wes! - Come on! - Excuse me? Let's hit the road, buddy. You think you're taking Wesley? Wait. You think Wesley's staying here? Well, this is where he lives. - I don't know where else he would go. - Into the woods with his dad. That's where you're gonna live? In that serial killer shack by the lake? Don't you listen to her, Wes. It's a very spacious, prefabricated mobile domicile. So, what happens when you have practice or a game or, you know... - I will take him with. - Uh-huh. - Coach lets me get away with anything. - Huh. Perks of being a veteran. You haven't put a second of thought into this, have you? A few, actually. You're never home, and I'm not letting my little butter bones become a latch-key dog. I will figure something out. - Hmm. Unacceptable. - Yeah. That is not happening. I'm perfectly capable of looking after Wesley James Lonnergan on my own. - Come on, big fella. - No. You're not taking him. Get your little... Let's let Wesley decide. - I'm ready. - You're going down, woman. I've got an enema in an hour. Not mine. - So could we just do this already? - I'm ready. Let me get a picture with his two leashes for his various social media pages. All right, on the count of three, I want you to release your leashes, and whoever he goes to gets to keep him. All right, it's okay. One, two... If you go to your dad, I'll give you so much bacon. - Hurry! - Three! Hey, sweetie! Come on. Mommy loves you! We'll give her a chance. - Come here, baby. - Wesley. No, no, no, no, no, no! You've been a good boy! Wesley, don't listen to him! Who's the best little dog? You're the best little... Who's the best little doggy? You're the best little doggy. Oh. No, Wesley, come back. Are we gonna do this all day? Come on. Wanna tussle with Daddy? Wanna tussle with Daddy? Oh, yeah, that's right. Help! Wesley, help! I like that. I like that. Wesley, save me! Save me! I'm dying, Wesley. Help! Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? - Oh, no. Oh, no. - Wesley! Wesley, no! Come on! Come back! - Yep. See ya. - Wesley, come on! - Well, this is a perfectly good waste of a Saturday. - Great. - Yup... - Wesley! Wesley! Okay, guys. Easy. Easy. Good. - Sit! - Wesley, please! - Wesley! - Sorry. - Who's the owner? - CLAY, OLIVE: I am! That's me. How did you... Never unleash an untrained animal. - Oh. - We-We-We would never usually do that. - No. - But anyway, thank you. What were you doing, Wesley? What were you doing? By the way, can you teach me that whistle thing? There's no trick to it. What's your name, miss? Oh. Olive Greene. - Glenn Hannon. - Nice to meet you. I run a rehabilitation and training center. Clay Lonnergan, from the Wolves, you know? Huh. If you, uh... If you ever want to improve Wesley's off-leash obedience... Yeah? - Come on down. - Great. Thank you. Yeah. - All right, guys. - Is it... Two hands. What are you doing? Well, you won't let me leave with Wes, and I'm not leaving without him. You can't stay here, Clay. Okay. Oh! I didn't spill a drop. I'm serious. Life's too important to be taken seriously. You know that he is better off with me. I know that you know that. I know that you know that he knows it's my place or no place. Look, buddy, I... I'm trying, but she's just not respecting your wishes. Get out! Out! Do I have time for a nap? Maybe a quick massage? All right, you, out! Come on! - Get... Get up! - Is this a massage? - Get... - What are we doing right now? Oh, Mommy. Come on! Oh, that feels good. This isn't funny, Clay! Oh-ho-ho! All right, you want nasty Olive? Sure. I'll go get her. Don't forget the handcuffs, honey. You're gonna come with Daddy for a little bit. Yes. Police. I would like to report an intruder. - His name is... - Let's go. Clay! Clay! Clay! Wait, wait, wait. - Clay? - Good boy! You can't do this. You're not serious! - You're crossing a line here, Clay. - I can't hear you. If you don't turn around right now... Don't make me hate you, Clay. Say bye-bye to Mommy. No, no, no, no. Oh, it's on. Next case on the docket, we have Greene v. Lonnergan. The outstanding issue of contention is the custody arrangements for... a mixed breed dog? And joint custody is not an option? Very much not so, Your Honor. The microphone does not work. Mr. Lonnergan, you claim that yours is the only name on the pet adoption certificate? Uh, yes. That is certifiable. May I see the document? No, Your Honor. I'm sorry? It would be really great if you could just take my word for it. Do you have the document, Mr. Lonnergan? Yes or no. Yes. It's-It's-It's in my head, not in my actual hand. Okay, the hard way it is. Your Honor, if I may, Mr. Lonnergan has already proven himself - to be an extremely reckless guardian, someone who's... - Reckless? I'm sor... Reckless? Your Honor, if having an awesome time with my top dog is reckless, then yeah, guilty as charged. - He took him snowboarding. - Yes, I did. - He told me he had the best time of his life. - He was terrified. You should have seen his face. His ears were pinned back. Since Mr. Lonnergan cannot provide the adoption record, I'm forced to consider other factors. Yes. Wesley, if he thinks at all, thinks 623 Hicks Street, Ms. Greene's residence, is his home. Yes. The evidence supports Ms. Greene's contention that she is the primary caretaker. She pays for all the costs to provide for the animal while Mr. Lonnergan here... Well, I'm an ambassador of joy, Your Honor. Seems less prepared for the responsibility of sole custody at this time. It is the court's decision to award sole custody to Ms. Greene. - Ah! - Wait. Stop. Rewind. What? Mr. Lonnergan will have visitation rights every other weekend. Well, I object! Overruled! He's my dog! I'm his daddy! Every dog needs his daddy! Every daddy needs his dog. Mr. Lonnergan, this ruling is temporary. I'll assign a veterinary behaviorist to evaluate you both, and there will be a continuance of this matter in 60 days. At that point, I'll decide who gets custody of the dog for good. Understood? Yes. Court's adjourned. I warned you. Give me Bumblebee. - His name's Bumblebee Bob. Bumblebee Bob. - Uh-huh. If you think I'm just gonna roll over and play dead, you're sadly mistaken. Here, buddy. Bring it on. Oh, I'm gonna bring it everywhere. - Game face. - Give it to her. - You look like a baby taking a dump. - That's right. A little bit, yeah. - You didn't even see it. - It was not good. Say bye to Daddy! Say bye to your daddy. - I'll fight for you, Wesley! - It's a bad day. Come on. - No matter how long! No matter how far! - Let's go, buddy. Come on. - I'll fight for you! - Let's go. Come on. Let's go. This case is all about me proving how much I love Wesley. Right? And what better way to do that than by representing myself? So a lawyer's too expensive, huh? It's an absolute racket. You're innocent until proven broke, man. What do you got? A little reading? "Winning Child Custody: A Father's Guide." That one looks good. It's for real human children though. What's this one? Custody Warriors. That one sounds a little aggressive. But I like where your head's at. Well, we are going to war, my friend. The fun-loving Clay guy is just not gonna work anymore. I have to prove that I am a... a better, more responsible parent than Olive. Ha! Wow. How are you gonna do that? - I have no idea. - Bit of a stretch. Oh, here's my nephew. His deadbeat dad bailed on him, so my sister asked me to watch him while she's at work. Hey, Koji. This is my friend Clay. I'm gonna go get ready for practice. You're gonna hang out here. See you later. All right, boys! Let's go! Koji, right? The dog-walker will be by at 3:00. This is just an experiment, sweetie. If you don't like it, we'll find a day care center or something, okay? Mommy got you a special DVD for dogs in case you get lonely. It's two paws up, so that's good, right? Okay. Uh... Oh, baby, don't look at me like that. Mommy has to go to work. I'll be back soon. I love you, baby. Oh, I know you're sad. Give me a kiss. It's okay. I miss you. I'm gonna miss you. Oh, I want one more kiss. Mmm! Yeah! Okay. I'm going now. I have to go. Bye, baby! Wesley, Mommy's home... Oh... Oh, my God. Wesley! Wesley! Wesley! Wesley? Okay. Okay. Yes. Uh, hello? Um, I've been robbed, and my dog is missing. Oh. Scratch that. We're fine. My apologies. What are you doing, little guy? What are you doing? Are you serious? Hmm. - Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. - Hey! - We've been waiting such a long time. - Wesley, sit. Hi. Right, because you're always on time. Wesley, come here. Stop, Wesley. Is that a note about me being late? I'm sorry. I cannot share my notes with you, Ms. Greene. Oh. Okay. Sorry. Welcome. I'm Dr. Wendy. I'm a veterinary behaviorist, and I've been appointed as a friend of the court to help determine who is best suited to care for Wesley in the event of a custody ruling. Can I just say, Dr. Wendy, it is a pleasure to be here. It's a pleasure to have you here, Mr. Lonnergan. Thank you. How about you, Olive? You happy to be here? Excuse me. Just so you know, he's not really like this. The clothes, the hair, the politeness. He's doing a thing. - Olive, I don't know what... - You will not con your way through this. The real you will screw it up. Olive... I'm sorry, Doctor. Can we, uh... Can we put aside our personal issues and try and focus on why we're here? I hate you. Uh... Do you often express your hostilities in front of Wesley? Hmm. I'm not hostile. I'm just... - Oh. - What are you writing? Uh-huh. Hey. Okay. Hmm. Oh. Interesting. Wow. Tension. - Is he okay? - Shh! I'm working now. Okay, Wes. Okay, Wesley. - It's okay, Wesley. - Ohh! That is what I was afraid of. - What? What did he say? - Is he... Is he okay? Wesley is on the verge of psychological disarray. I mean, just look at him swimming around in there, lost in his own thoughts. Well, what are we supposed to do? Consistent discipline, something he is clearly not familiar with. - Here, take a look at these. - Love to. We will meet again so that I can monitor Wesley's progress. In addition, I'll be assessing each of you individually at your respective homes so I can determine who's providing the most nurturing environment for Wesley. The only thing being nurtured in his trailer is E. coli. Ms. Greene, as Wesley's primary caregiver, the burden lies with you to demonstrate an improvement in his behavior by our next session. Hmm. We're all pulling for you, Olive. Psychological disarray. What are you doing to him? That woman was clearly insane. He's perfectly fine. The professional doggie whisperer lady says he's not, so we gotta do something. He's fine. He's better than fine. In fact, we've been having a riot, lately. Tearing it up, big time. Is that right, butter bones? You've been tearing it up? You know what? We should go see that Glenn guy. He had a good whistle. He doesn't need obedience training. Okay? And this thing that you're doing, this brand-new Clay thing, it isn't gonna work. So you got a little cranky and shredded the living room. Happens to the best of us. It doesn't mean you're in disarray. Does it? Wesley? Wesley James! That's it, mister. I'm calling the dog trainer. Look what else I found. In 2004, right? Joshua Little and Linda Perkins waged a two-year battle over their dog, Gee-Gee. Gigi? Gee-Gee? - What is it, French? - Whatever. Probably. After a three-day trial... Listen. This is the good part. Mr. Little prevails. Pass the puck to anyone else on the whole team! - You're never gonna guess how he won. - What? Jo... Hey! Jonah! - Do not lick the ice! - My tongue is stuck! I don't think Jonah's gonna work in goal... He made a video, a video called "A Day in the Life of Gigi," and he used it as evidence of what a great life they had together. A key part of him winning. Hey, that's it! Stop fighting! Put your gloves back on! No fighting! So that's the plan, man. Just make an awesome video showing how we are the... the ultimate ambassadors of joy. - You with me? - Yeah. Big time. - For sure. - Good man. What are we doing? We'll figure it out later. Hang on a second. All right, shift change! Let's go! Koj, ready to hop in? Can you talk to him? Like a pep talk or something? I can't get him on the ice. He's just sad all the time. - What am I gonna say? - You're a professional hockey player. Just inspire him. Make something up about dedication, teamwork. Whatever your coach says to you guys. I don't know. Life. It stinks, right? It just makes you so mad sometimes. You know what I do, Koji, when life gets me mad? Hmm? I get mad right back at it. It feels good to let off a little steam. But I do it out there, man, on the ice. Oh, yeah. That's hockey, man. Go ahead. Try it. I know you got some steam in there. Pick up this bag. Just slam it down. Let out that steam. Come on! Lift it! How about this? Come on. One, two, three. That's hockey, man! Come on! Incoming! Get down! Hey! What the hell's going on in here? Hockey. Hockey? Just hockey. We should clean this up, huh? - He's a good boy. - Yes, he is. It's okay. Shh, shh. Okay, folks. Start the show. - I usually like to start with a little demonstration. - Ooh. Demonstration. Clyde. Clyde. Meet Master Tank. He was picked up last night at a police-raided dogfight. He's a trained killer. Okay. Your dog is 99.8% wolf. I told you. - And wolves... - Wes. run in packs. Ooh! Your dog needs a pack leader. Oh, Wesley, no! Sorry. Stop that, Wesley. Olive, right? Yeah, you remember my name? Of course. Would you say that you're this dog's pack leader? Well, I'm his mommy. Right here. - You're the leader? - Yep. - Sssss. Uh-uh-uh. - Stop. I don't think Wesley thinks so. He's uncomfortable, tense. Wesley, Wesley, Wesley. No, he just... It's a little game. A little game. Ah-ha! Wesley James Lonnergan! Traitor. I have to say, Wesley needs help. His behavior won't improve on its own. That's a good boy. You just need a pack leader, don't you? Is this guy for real? - Good boy. - I think he's great. With a few more sessions, you'll have "The Hannon Way" down pat. Okay. We can set up another group session like this that you and your... boyfriend? Um, we're separated. Recently. It's recent. My one-on-one sessions are a fast-track way of helping, but I only work with one owner at a time. Might that interest you? - Yes. - No. Fantastic. Okay. Let's try something else. Check him out. Not bad for an old guy. Bumblebee Bob? It's his favorite stuffed animal, and it's like a comfort blanket to him, and, you know, it calms him down. Your dog shouldn't need a comfort blanket. - And... - Uh-huh. Relax. Don't worry. I'm gonna help you. With the proper training, these problems will go away. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Let's start with posture. What, Wesley's posture's bad? Not Wesley's. Yours. There's a tension in your body that Wesley can sense, and it makes him anxious. Watch. Feel my upper body. - Excuse me? - Start with the shoulders. You feel that? Firm, yet relaxed. It certainly is. Hey, that was a great first session. Remember, treat him like a dog, not like a child. - I'll try. - It's what he needs. Okay. Hey, would you like to... go out sometime? Without Wesley. Just... Just me and you? Um, you mean on, like, a date-type thing? Yeah. Like a date-type thing. - Is it okay if I think about it? - Of course. - Okay. - See ya later. - Thank you. - Good luck. Thanks. Okay. I packed his therma-paw boots in case it's icy. This is what it was like Thursday nights when I would go to my dad's. Oh. I almost forgot. Shoot. Can't... find... Bumblebee Bob, so if he whines at night, here's my shirt. Wait. You lost Bumblebee Bob? Don't start. - Hey. - Hey, baby. Come here, baby. Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you. I'm gonna miss you, Wesley. I'm gonna miss you. You're a good mom, you know that? Crazy, but good. All right, buddy. Oh. Oh, wait. Uh... I thought we could both read this and work on it together, see what works for Wesley, what doesn't. You're seriously seeing this guy? Yeah. Twice a week. Come on. You know, I was thinking about that. When my parents split up, I was out of control. Fights, tantrums, inappropriate peeing. Case in point, he'll get over it. He doesn't need... this guy. Well, it was your idea, so I guess I'm just going along with it. Well, I'm full of bad ideas. You know that. I do know that. But, um, we're gonna keep doing it 'cause it's good for Wesley. Bye, baby! Bye, Wesley! Bye, Wesley! You done with this? - Well, I am now. - Hmm. - Okay, what's going on? - What are you talking about? When you get nervous, you eat like a zombie. The trainer guy asked me out. Oh, the handsome dog guy with the pecs? Mmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, so what's the problem? I don't know if Wesley's ready for another man in my life. Well, I think we both know who's not ready. Who says I need a man? Good plan. Keep your heart in a cage and die alone. We're gonna try this again, okay? Put the black-and-white filter on. - It always looks like film noir, right? - It'll look... Yeah. - Wesley. - Action. I hear... Well, you can't be shooting now. - I've gotta... - Oh. - give the instructions, and then you shoot. - Yeah. You got this. Wes, Daddy is gonna throw the stick. You run. You pick up the stick. Listen, listen. This is the part where you always forget. You gotta bring it back to Daddy. Okay? Don't run off. Koj, you ready? It's take number... - Seven. - Seven. Okay. Buddy. One, two, three, go! - Uh... - No. That's, uh... Should we try it again? Go! - There he goes. - That's a good start. So why don't we like this guy? What's-his-face? - Glenn. - Yeah, Glenn. What's his problem? ♪ Da-da-da-da ♪ - Ooh. - Right? Because he looks like a well-read superhero? I could see why Olive's into him then. - This dude is a babe. - No, she's not into him. - No? - No. She just thinks a couple of one-on-one sessions might help. - I agree. - Yeah, I bet she does. - What, you think I'm worried about him? - I mean... I'm a professional hockey player, dude, not a dog trainer. You play for a minor league team. Secondly... - The Wolves. - Yeah, minor league team. And you're not ri... This guy's rich, man. He's got books out. He's got that super-hot rich face. Well, this is my year. - For what? - Hot rich face? His face is hot and rich. Koj! Yeah, tell him to bring it back now. Oh, you've been a good boy! Bring the stick back. Dude, I got your back. But the average age of retirement for an NHL goalie is, what, 28, 29? - Thirty? - We had this discussion. Moe Roberts. - All right. - Played for the Blackhawks until he was 46. Yeah, 100 years old. Okay. That's besides the point. Wouldn't that be crazy if this dude was Wesley's new stepdad? Look at that... That jawline is just chiseled like a Roman god, like a... like a marble bust. That is a... Oh, God, that's a sharp-looking man. I'll get Olive to give you his number and you can ask him on a date yourself. If this is bothering you... Are you having second thoughts about the whole Olive thing? - No, I just want my dog back. - All right. "Ambassadors of Joy," take one. Hey, hey. Oh, hi. Uh, before we have a hot chocolate in the morning, Wesley and I like to take a little five-mile run around the lake. Don't we, buddy? Let's go! Oh! - Wesley, go! - Okay. - Go! - Hey, Coach. Cut that, Coach. Your dog's still here. Action. Me and Wesley, we even do laundry together, don't we, buddy? Bring it here. Oh, yeah. Out. Out. Out. Oh! Oop. Just leave it for Daddy. This is Daddy's now. Daddy's gonna put that up. Oh, oh. That's Daddy's. No, no, no. Video's going great. We're just inseparable. I don't know what it is about him. It's just his coat, his lovable little... - And he... he just does... - Cut. Things like that. Where is he going? Wesley, this is... Hi. Yes, I've made several canine-friendly accommodations to Wesley's living quarters, and he just loves it. This is my latest version of canine carpentry. Wesley! Wesley! - Should we start over? - I thought that was pretty good. Is that good for court? You wanna show the judge that? That doghouse? - We can show the judge that doghouse. - Put another level in post. Hey. Out. - Koji, let's cut. - He's going to poo! Oh, attaboy. Droppin' a deuce. We don't need to see that. What more could we want, butter bones, huh? A Ping-Pong table, Jacuzzi. Look at me. I know how it feels to be from a broken home, pal. You got me. That's enough, right? Obviously not. Let's see if this works. Mommy's shirt. Yeah. You like that, huh? Here we are. - Dinner was fantastic. - Yes. Remind me never to share dessert with you again. I think I had one spoonful. I'm sorry. It was so good. And I really haven't been anywhere that special in a long time, so thank you. Oh, that's a real shame. Well, it was a great night. Thank you. It doesn't have to end. Um... - Can I tell you something? - Yes. Secret. Oh. Um... Yeah, I'm... I'm just not... I... I just think it's too s... It's okay. No, I get it. - There's no need to rush things. - Sorry. Oh, no need to rush things. It's okay. - Okay, yeah. - I, um, just... It just feels right with you. It really does. Tha... Thank you. That's nice. Thank you for understanding. Um... Okay, well, good night. Good night. Thank you. - Call me or something. - Okay. Ooh! That cleared your head! Am I right? Totally clear. Yep. - Thanks. - Oh, yeah. Hey, you guys. Oh, Wesley, come here, baby. Come here. Oh, yes, baby, yes! How are you? How are you? Wesley. Wesley. Yeah. Mommy missed you. - He loves it here. - Yeah? - Well, thanks for showing him a good time. - It's what I do. So how was he, behavior-wise? Oh, he was... he was... a perfect gentleman. - Yeah? - Yeah. Mwah. No, um, whining at night or, you know, tearing things up? - None of that? - No, look, my diagnosis... He just needed some alone time with his poparooni. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, bye! Wesley, are you being better with Daddy than you are with me? Are you doing that? Wesley, that is not right. Hayden, dump and chase. We're gonna work on that shooting now, buddy. That a boy. Focus. Oh! That's okay. Hey. Kadurski, where did you get a doughnut? Let's try one more. Come on. When you drop the puck, you're gonna look at the puck real quick, then look where you're gonna shoot. Go! That's all right. Let's try that again. This stinks! I can't do it! Whoa! Hey. How are you gonna score without a stick? Huh? What happens when the puck comes at you? What if another puck comes flying at you? What if another puck... Oh, you're just gonna hit it away like that? Oh. Oh-ho-ho-ho. Rhett! I think we found your goalie. Yeah? Welcome to the crease club. I know. I know. I need it. Can I have it back? Wesley, I need it back. I need it back. I need it back. Wesley, remember, you're not supposed to sleep with me in the bed anymore. You're gonna have to go to your own bed. I'll take you in a few minutes. You can snuggle for now. Yeah, you can snuggle. This is nice, right? Just the two of us? Yeah. We don't need Daddy, right? It's better without him. No more snoring, no more screaming at the TV. Mm-hmm. No more wet, stinky hockey socks. It's better, right? Yeah. This is Wesley's first time here. Oh, Wesley will make best friends here. We're a family really. Happy Hound Day Care is a perfect place for Wesley to play, laugh and discover. - Are those, um... - Oh. Those are original works. We set aside a portion of each day for arts and crafts. They are just so talented. I can see that. He's gonna love it. Okay. Thank you. Mommy has to go. Have a great time. Okay. I'll give you the leash. Free yourself of those thoughts. Get that energy flowing. Okay, Jen, the energy's starting to flow right down through his tail, so we're gonna use the paw, dip it in the paint. Think of the birds on the trees. Get the paw... There you go. Feel his energy shift? His energy shifted when you did that, all the way through his tail. Okay? Wesley, when you're ready, come make a painting. Lindsey. The burnt sienna? Somebody stop him! He's Jackson Pollocking the hallway! Oh, no, no, no, no! Stop him! No, no, no, no, no! Get back! Wesley! That is what I'm trying to say. I think clearly the dog has some sort of anxiety disorder. Wes. Kenneth, I have to call you back. Sir, Wesley ruined a number of paintings today, not to mention my office. Paintings? Why is he painting anyway? Why is he in a cage? He was being overly animated, so I put him in the time-out corner. - You're lucky I don't get overly animated. - Don't point your finger at me. - There's three pointing back at you and your dog. - What's next? Waterboarding? Come here, buddy. Unbelievable. - Come on, buddy. - Hey, what are you doing here? Uh, you listed him as your emergency contact. So when I got your voice mail, I called him. Sorry. - Emergency? Really? - Did you see the hallway? Shut the door, please. You put him in doggy Guantánamo. It was nothing like that. A torture chamber. Can I ask you a question? Would you rather leave him with complete strangers than with his own dad? They were not strangers. It was doggy day care. You could have called me. I would have taken him. But it was not your day to have him. - Why does it have to... - Wesley, come here! Come here. That lamp shouldn't be there anyway. You need to realize that you may no longer be married, but you still share custody of Wesley. You need to manage that, both for Wesley and for yourselves. Yes, Dr. Wendy. Maybe the dog lady's right. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I still get a knot in my belly when I think back to my mom and dad, I mean, just at each other's throats. - It's not good. - We don't have to be like that. No, we don't have to be like that. I don't wanna be like that. Maybe it would be good for Wesley if we, you know, were together every once in a while. Once in a while, we should get the band back together. I mean, nice. - Okay. - Clay, cake! When I get the cake, you guys keep Wesley here. You know, this was a good idea. - We need plates. - Plates. - You never fixed this. - You never fixed it. Do you remember? Do I remember? It was at the end of the longest road trip. I couldn't wait to get you into the bedroom. I willingly jumped up there. Hung on for dear life. It's, um... This is nice, right? I know, I know. - He's getting impatient. - Okay. Up top. Ooh, man. How about you? Ah! Wesley's really happy, right? Yeah, he's like every little guy. He just wants to see his parents happy, together, having fun. - Come on, man. - So what are we gonna do about that? I'm sure we can figure something out, right? Like what? - Like... - Hello! - Where's the birthday dog? - Oh. Olive! Hey. Yeah. Right on, buddy. - Hey, Glenn. - Clay, what's up? I didn't know you were coming. - Did you invite Glenn? - No. Hi. - I did not. - Well, he's here. I may have mentioned it, but... I was in the neighborhood, and, uh, we've been... we've been seeing a little bit of each other lately. Yeah. Yeah, she told me about the private sessions. That's great. And we're dating. Awesome. Yep. Hey, Wesley! Who's a good boy? Yeah! Happy birthday! - Here, Koji. - Lovely. Hi. - Hi! - How are ya? Good. Nice... Nice to see you. Yeah, it's good. How are you? - All right. - I'm just gonna put this... I need a big knife. - Who's this guy? - Yeah. Let's get... - This is Koji. - Koji. All right. This is Emily. You already met Libby. - And Clay. - Oh, yeah. Clay. My man, Clay. Is he one? Is he two? Is he three? You knocked me down. Let's go again! Harder! I want it hard! Let's go! Nice job, Lonnergan. Looking good. Thanks, Coach. I'm great. Feeling great. Wesley and I have been training with Glenn Hannon. Do you know him? He's got a great reputation. Hmm. Huh. I believe it's important that dogs sleep in their own bed. Oh, yes. Of course. He loves his bed. He sleeps in that bed every night. He never, ever sleeps with me. - Hmm. Really? - Yeah, no. - Can you please direct him to get in his bed? - Oh, he... Yes. Of course I can. Yes. Wesley. Get into your bed. Wesley, get into your bed. Wesley, get into your bed! Yeah. - Well, we're a work in progress. - Mm-hmm. I mean, but he's so cute. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, hey. How is practice going? Well, this is my year. Here. Um... Well, this is the... the last visitation until the court reconvenes, so... I told you I'd make you a copy of these. - Nice. - Mm-hmm. - All right. - Okay. Let's go be men, huh? Get that stick ready, man. You gotta get... You gotta get that stick ready. Yeah? No? Get frustrated. Get angry! I can't! Listen to me. Sometimes you do everything right, and the puck's still gonna go in. It doesn't change who you are, man. All right? You got this. Wah! Hey! Good boy. Ha! We got a big day tomorrow, butter bones. Dr. Wendy is coming. I need you on your best behavior, buddy. Yeah. God, that's disgusting. Oh, you know that's mommy's shirt, don't you? I miss her too, buddy. Hey, buddy. What is... Oh! You're a bad boy! Wes! Okay, okay. Hey. Come on. Stay. Such a bad, bad boy. Yes, you have. Bad boy. Oh. Wes! Wes! Hey, buddy! Come here! Nudge the door, buddy! Nudge it! Nudge it! Mr. Lonnergan! Hey! Mr. Lonnergan, are you okay? Fabulous! Oh, I'm fine. Yeah. How are you? - Mr. Lonnergan! - I'll be with you in a minute! Why is there smoke? Hey, buddy. Yeah. I love you too. Turn the oven off. - Something is burning. - It's the steam from the shower. - I'm good. - Uh-huh. It's all good. Yeah. - Mr. Lonnergan, we have an appointment right now. - I'm coming! Ah! Wes. Hide this. Where is she? I'm coming! Don't go! Oh, my God. Come on, baby. Come on. Outside, outside. Outside. Good. Dr. Wendy. Dr. Wendy! Hey! Dr. Wendy! Dr. Wendy. Wesley! Hi, baby! - Here. - Oh! What's wrong? Well, congratulations on winning the case. What are you talking about? I blew the evaluation. It was a total frickin' disaster. Oh, Clay. What? What? You wanna come inside and have some tea? Come on. All right. Have some tea. Well, it's probably for the best. I didn't deserve him. - I mean, don't say that. - What? I'm 35 years old with a broken body and a broken life. It's awesome. Come jump on the Clay train. Clay. Honey, we could have avoided this whole mess if I... - if I just... - What? What's that? Oh. Those are costumes. Costumes for what? For the festival. Really? You two are going to the doggie festival without me? I didn't think it would really make any sense for you to go. And Glenn, his center's having a demo and he asked me to help, so... Awesome. Boys, this is it. First game. We got a big game tonight. Those other guys are really moving out there. I need 110% from all you guys. We're gonna go out there and crush the Papa John's Wolverines, all right? - Yeah! - Koji, you ready? Koji, hey! Koji, keep your head in the game, all right? - You ready to go? - Yeah. You're our tender tonight, buddy. You're gonna stop some pucks? Damn it, Clay. Go, Wolf Pack! - Hey, Clay, you in here? - What? Dude, open this door. You gotta leave me alone. Where were you, man? We just won. Koji was awesome. Thanks for showing up, man. Real nice. Well, congratulations. Now leave me alone. If I didn't know any better, I'd say this mess in here is a cry for help. Disgusting. What's wrong with you? Well, this mess is Clay Lonnergan. Wife-less and dog-less. What do you mean, "dog-less"? Where's Wesley? Well, look around, man. This is what the good doctor saw. Game over. What about that super sweet video we were making? What about that? Oh, that... was Apocalypse Now with a dog. And just to stick the knife in a little further, I find out she's going to the dog festival. I mean, you know that's my favorite day of the year, man. And she's going in a sweet ladybug outfit and with that tool bag, Glenn. Just because Glenn has literally perfect bone structure doesn't mean you need to give up on this whole thing. It's not giving up if there's no fight. The people you love always leave you. Ain't that right, Koji? Huh? Yeah, you know all about it. There's nothing any of us can do about it, so that's what I'm gonna do. Nothing. For the last time, the both of you, get out of here! I know you're hurting, but don't you dare talk to my nephew like that, all right? He's nine years old. Pull it together, man. You're an adult. This is embarrassing. Let's go, Koj. Sometimes you do everything right, and the puck still goes in. I didn't do everything right though. So? Try again. Even monkeys fall from trees. Even monkeys fall from trees. I think I really hurt Clay. Honey, you both have been at each other for quite some time. - I mean... - I know. - Really? - Yeah, but I guess... But he was so sad when he saw that I was going to the festival without him. You know what? I... I thought he wanted to have a family. - He did. - Right? He... He said he did. I know he did. Then he started to get all weird, and he started pushing back. And... I don't know what is going on in his head. Obviously a lot. But, um, if he ever figures it out, he'll make a... a great father to somebody someday. That was a good one, but we're gonna try it again. Get ready. Here we go. Oop. Rhett, can I have a word, buddy? Yeah, come over if you wanna talk. Whoa, whoa! Whoa! I just... I wanna ask. Can you forgive me? I'm asking your forgiveness. Please forgive me. You okay, bud? I have a plan, but I need your help. I don't suppose either of you guys has a sewing machine? I do. You loved me... even when I was an ass. And I will never forget that. Olive, you are the wings to my heaven. Wow, dude. I didn't know you had that in you. - Neither did I. - It's so good. - Koj? - Nice job. Let's do this. Yeah. Come see a free demonstration. "Lead your Pack and Control your Misbehaving Pup The Hannon Way." Come see a free demonstration! Ooh! "Lead your Pack and Control your Misbehaving Pup The Hannon Way." - Hey, Dolly. - Hi, Clay. Good to see you. Yeah. Hi. - See a demonstration later. - I'll check it out. Okay. Thank you for coming. Wonderful costume. - Suzie. - Hi! - Hey. It's Clay. - Uh-huh. - I need to ask you a really big favor. - Mm-hmm. Your dog is 99.8% wolf, and wolves run in packs. Any pack leaders here today? We're trying to turn you into pack leaders. - I can't wait to read it. - Enjoy. - I'm a hit. - Good. Mind handing out brochures? I gotta go to the truck for another box of books. - Of course. - All right. Uh, are you gonna wear that all day? I was planning on it. - I'll be two minutes. - Okay. Stay. Just kidding. Jo-Jo. Jo-Jo, just stand down. Ringo, give us the floor, man. I'm just gonna take over. I cleared it with Sally. She said it's okay. - Okay, cool man. - Hey... I'm sorry. How do you get this... This cord is so long! - Got it. - Thank you. There. Olive! Dr. Greene. Is that Daddy? I'm not the butthead-head you know. I'm Bob. And, uh... Well, I mean, a bee ain't nothing without honey, and you're my honey. I thought you were gonna hand out brochures. - Um... - I was. Well... And you loved me even when I was, well, just an ass, and a big one. And, uh, I will never forget that. Never. - Is that Clay? - It is. You're honey. You've always been. - What the hell is he doing? - That's right. I don't know. You're embarrassing yourself. You, Olive, are the wings to my heaven. People think you're my girlfriend. You look bad, I look bad. G-Glenn. Hey. I look good, right? You look great. I mean, this is... You're killing it. She's gonna love it, right? - Good job. - Thanks, guys. Uh, I'm not sure what you're, uh, trying to do here, but I think it's time for you to see yourself out. You know what, Glenn? I think there's a poodle that needs help. You're embarrassing yourself. Really? Give me a drumroll. Ooh! Stay down, Bumblebee Bob. Easy does it, bee. Come on, Bumble. Just stay down. Man, this is just a couple of grown men fighting in a dog festival. Think we're on an ice hockey? Wesley! Wesley! Wesley! Sic balls! Sic balls! You guys, this is not good. - Down! - Come here, Wes! Come here. Come... Wes. You want more? Come... Come on! - Who's laughing now? - You want more? What are you doing? Stop! Why are you doing this? It was the insect who started it. - Guys! - Olive, what do you think? Um... You didn't like it? You thought this would make everything okay? Well, yeah. Oh, my God. Zzz. Zzz. Cute isn't enough. I'm done waiting for you to grow up. I'm just done. Easy come, easy... - Oh, God! - Come on, dude. Let's go. - Are you kidding me? - Dude, come on. You stay down there with your dumb face. First Circuit Court of the State of Illinois, Judge Hutcheon presiding. Court is now in session. Mr. Lonnergan, on your final court-appointed visit, Dr. Wendy reports that not only was she unimpressed with your living conditions, she found you to be, and I quote, "a complete lunatic." Uh, it was... it was a bad morning. I'll give her that much. Ms. Greene clearly has the more stable home, and this probably would have been the deciding factor, that is until I took a look at the adoption records. Your Honor, those documents are missing. The dog rescue agency was able to locate a copy. Thank you. Prior to marriage, the adoption records were signed by Clay Lonnergan. That makes Wesley the legal property of Mr. Lonnergan. This is no longer a custody issue. Bailiff, please return Mr. Lonnergan's property to him. Court adjourned. That's it? I'm sorry, Ms. Greene. No, wait. But who makes these laws? Wesley's property? - Ms. Greene. - I'm sorry. When was the last time your car was happy to see you? Or your couch? A piece of property can't love you back, so don't tell me that my dog is the same as a stupid TV or a lamp, because he's not! He's not. Enough. Oh, God. Come here. Come on, buddy. All right, little buddy. Daddy's gotta go to work now, okay? Good boy. Okay. Look at this. Wait. I'm gonna make you a bed of freshly washed jerseys. That one's not so fresh. Okay, buddy. There you go. All right. Come here. Seventy minutes of hell, my friend. I love you. Hey, Coach. You wanted to see me? Lonnergan, come on in. I gotta tell you, you've been extremely impressive these past few weeks. I've been trying. Longo's out with a sprained ankle. They're calling you up. Huh. Knock 'em dead, kid. I haven't been called "kid" in a while. - Thanks, Coach. - Good luck to you. Huh. Rhett, they're calling me up. Ah. Ah. Wes! Wesley? Wesley! Clay? Oli. Uh... I lost Wesley. What? - I lost Wesley. - Just tell me where you are. I've been looking all night for him. I just can't find him. I'll be mad at you later. Let's just find our dog. Okay, people, we need to work quickly. Let's assume he's walking at a normal pace. In this urban environment, he could be in an eight-mile radius. Uh, he's an approachable, mid-size dog, so that means that he should be easy to spot. We've gotta get the fliers up fast. There are staple guns and tape in my trunk. Let's go find Wesley. All right. Let's go. Come on, guys! Come on! I'll just lift you! One, two... You're almost as heavy as me, man. - Thank you. - Move on, soldier. Bring it in. Beautiful. Watch your fingers. And... We gotta go. If we're gonna make it, we have to leave. - Man, I'm not going anywhere, man. - Dude. - I've gotta find my dog. - Come on! Gotta get all these fliers up. We can give 'em to Olive. Dude. - Don't "dude" me. - God! What's going on? He got called up. We're not gonna make it unless we leave now. - He got called up? - Yeah. Come on, dude! Let's go! Clay, you've gotta go. You got called up. I'm right where I need to be. Yeah, but I've got this covered, okay? This is everything you've been working for. This guy. Is that guy taking down our fliers? Why would... Come on. - Hey! - Whoa! What? Just stay back. This may get dicey. I've lived with you for five years. I know dicey. Why are you giving this to me? Ah! Ow! - Do you see him? - Shh, shh. There he is. Wes. Here, buddy. Shh, shh, shh. - Wesley, baby! - Hey, buddy. His name is Bandit. He's my dog! Yeah! That's right! His name is Bandit. His name's Wesley. It says it on his collar. - Get him, Jeb! - Get outta here! Easy, big fella. Easy. Listen, buddy. I'm sure you got your problems, man. Let me tell you, brother. I got mine. But right now, the only problem I have is you. That dog is my life. I got nothing without that dog. All right? So I'm asking, one bum to another bum, let us... let us take our boy home. And just so you know, he can bench-press 300 pounds. Give or take... 50. Baby, do you wanna... Thank you. Thank you. Hi, baby. Come here. Whoa, whoa. - All right. - Thank you so much. Let's go! - You like hockey? - I love hockey. - Clay! - Here's 20 bucks. You and Gandalf, go see the wolves. I'll probably just buy crack. Wesley, we were worried about you. Buddy, we gotta go right now. - Yeah. - Come on. - We were looking all over for you. - One second. Bye, baby. Listen. We could be gone for a while. They don't know how long Longo's gonna be out for. - Okay. - Yeah. - When do you leave? - Tonight, after the game. Take care of Daddy. If we don't leave now, we're gonna miss it. Let's go! Go, go, go. Have a great game. I will. Come on! Race you to the car! Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! My grandma runs faster than that, Koji. Get in the car, Wes. You too, Koj. There you go, buddy. All right, yeah. Clay Lonnergan gets his first start in goal tonight for the Chicago Wolves in front of a sold-out crowd. Well, the pressure is on. He's worked very hard for this. He'd love to be the number-one guy. He has to be very nervous. Olive, hey, it's Rhett. Come in! Hey. Why aren't you at the game? Shh. Just listen, okay? I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I understand now that our timing was all wrong, and that... Wh... Hang on. Just... Are you okay? Shut up. Shut up for a second. "I've been thinking about a lot of things, and I understand now that our timing was all wrong. You were ready to start a family and I wasn't, and now I'm ready, but you moved on, and I have to live with that. But it doesn't mean Wesley should have to. I know now that he needs his mom just as much as he needs his dad. And that's why I want..." Koji! Koji, now! "That's why I want you to always be in his life. So forget what the judge said. He'll always be our dog." Um... Clay wrote that in case you were wondering. I didn't write those... I don't feel those things towards you. That's how Clay thinks, and I think we're... - I think we're done here, right? Okay. - You can go. See ya. Come on, buddy. You did it. We gotta go. See ya, Wesley. See ya, Olive. Oh, baby. Ladies and gentlemen, here come your Chicago Wolves! And the fans have been waiting for a long time. This game, a lot rides on it. First place, play-off implications and the arch rival, Admirals, just down the street. Okay. Let's go. Let's go! Let's go, Lonnergan. We got your back. Bring it in, man. Clay Lonnergan gets hit, and he is down, and that is too bad. He has been terrific tonight. That might be the best game I've ever seen you play. Amazing. You got your bell rung, but you're gonna be fine. Right, Koj? - Yeah. - Give him a high five. We gotta take off. I'll live to fight another day, man. Here we go. All right, buddy. We'll see you in the waiting room. Ready, Koj? Come on, bud. Your X-rays are negative. You should be good to go in a day or so. Thanks, Doc. Mr. Lonnergan, your doctor is ready to see you now. I just saw the doctor. Hi. Hi. The boys delivered your message. How badly did they screw it up? Well, it was Rhett, so it was pretty bad. That guy. But it was perfect. Really? Mm-hmm. - Like perfect, perfect? - Like perfect, perfect. So I was thinking that there might be a way for us to both take care of Wesley together. How? Come back home. I just have one question. Will you... stop divorcing me? I think I fell back in love with you just now. Now, I know things haven't been normal lately. Then again, they never are, right? There's gonna be a little transition, but you'll be fine. You ready for this, butter bones? Yeah. Come here! Come here! Come. Come on. Let's go surprise Mommy. Let's go. Go. Wesley, meet Danny. Hi, baby. Hi. You're a big brother now. Ohh. Uh-oh. He'll get used to it, right? Did you hear Wesley? He said he loves you. Subtitles by explosiveskull
