LIFE AND LOVE AND LAUGHTER FOR NOW AND EVER AFTER A GIRL A BOY A KISS NO GREATER JOY THAN THIS MERRILY WE LIVE STROLLIN' THROUGH A VALLEY OR UP AND DOWN AN ALLEY WE NEVER FRET OR FUSS IT'S ALL THE SAME IT'S ALL THE SAME TO US MERRILY WE LIVE EVERY DAY'S A SUNNY MAY DAY A BRIGHT AND GAY DAY HOW WELL WE KNOW BARNUM NEVER IN HIS HEYDAY PUT ON A FINER SHOW ISN'T THIS A SWEET DREAM? A KNOCK-YOU-OFF-YOUR-FEET DREAM? AND JUST BETWEEN US TWO IT'S NOT A DREAM, IT'S TRUE MERRILY WE LIVE Etta! Rosa! We've been robbed! Oh, Grosvenor's fainted! Look! The silver's gone! Grosvenor! Wake up! Quick, do something! Get the smelling salts! - The what? - The smelling salts. Yeah. If this is another one of your tricks, I'll throw you in the fish pool. Oh, it's the truth. Honestly, it is. I was running through the kitchen on my way out of the pool, and it was just like panamania -- uh, panorama. Anyway, there was a lot of excitement, and there was Grosvenor and Rosa and Etta. Don't tell me Grosvenor fainted again. I hardly even spoke to the man. Only to kiss him goodnight. Well, no wonder he left. Even a tramp has some feelings. Ah, did you find any sign of Ambrose? He's vanished like the wind. Woe is us. That's the eighth tramp chauffeur in six months. This household is entirely much too much for me. - I'm through. - What, again? This time it's final. Irrevocable. Of course, it's all right if some people want to stay in a haven for derelicts. That's entirely up to them. Well, now that Ambrose stole the silver, maybe Mrs. Kilbourne will give up her idea of saving tramps. It's not as though this were the first one. This time I'm through, And nothing will make me change my mind -- nothing. Going somewhere, Grosvenor? Why, no, Miss Geraldine. The very idea. What's all this about the silver being gone? Yes, miss, I'm afraid it's only too true. Where's Ambrose? He disappeared with the silver, miss. And he also took my black patent leather shoes -- The ones with the taps on them. Well, I'm afraid we can't do anything about that now. We'll discuss it later. In the meantime, let's have some breakfast. It's going to be a little difficult about breakfast, if I may say so, miss. - You may say so. - Thank you. It's going to be a little difficult about breakfast. Now, you just said that. Stop repeating yourself, Grosvenor. What's going to be difficult? Ambrose also took the kitchen silver. Purely an oversight, I'm sure. Cheer up. He only stole your shoes. It might have been worse. Worse, miss? Yes. He might have taken your socks, too. He did. I hope he stole the piano so I won't have to practice anymore! Poor mother. She thought that Ambrose was the best tramp she ever tried to save. She'll have a fit when she hears about this. But then mother wouldn't be mother if she didn't have her fits. Aren't you going to call the police? Call the police? Are you crazy? With our luck, they'd find him and bring him back. And besides, what if the newspapers ever got ahold of it? Well, maybe if the newspapers found out about mother trying to be a philanthroput-- Philanthro-- How do you say that? Philanthrop-- Oh, come on. Have your breakfast. - Oh, all right. - Call Grosvenor. - What'll I call him? - Grosvenor. Grosvenor! What, no baseball bats? Relax, Grosvenor. You look like a scared barracuda. He's catching cold. Here comes pop. Good morning, dad. Is this yours? - What color is it? - White. I guess it's mine, then. Keep this thing out of my bedroom. - All right. - Where's my newspaper? Right over there, sir. You know father can't see over there. Quiet, Geraldine. - Quiet, Marion. - Shh. Listen. When I reach out for my paper the first thing in the morning, I like to know it's going to be right here! I beg your pardon, sir. I assure you that it won't happen again. Here, Grosvenor. Here. You take this. Don't cook it. Say, pop, why don't you have your -- your newsboy deliver the paper right in front of your coffee? Then you won't be so grumpy every morning. Young lady, when I need your advice, I'll ask for it! Anytime at all, pop. You remember me -- the working man's friend? Ye-- Geraldine, is that the way for your sister to come down to the breakfast table? No, pop. Well, then tell her to go upstairs and put some clothes on. Go upstairs and put some clothes on. What's this?! Oh, don't tell him about it until I get back! Don't tell me what until you get back? About what happened! Go upstairs and put some clothes on! All right, but remember! Ambrose isn't with us anymore. Good riddance. Grosvenor, who ever heard of eating cantaloupe with a contraption like that? Offhand, I couldn't say, sir. And that's why we're eating with all these, um...doodads -- because he walked off with the kitchen silver, too. Well, he certainly did a thorough job of it, didn't he? I'll say he did. He even took your brand-new set of golf clubs. What?! Whoo-whoo! Whoo! Boy, what an echo out there. Listen. Odlee-odlee-odlee-ay-hee-hoo! Odlee-odlee-odlee-Ay-hee-hoo! There, see? You don't see an echo. You hear it. Says who? Young man, don't you speak to your father like that! Uh, it wasn't me, dad. I-it was Dopey. Oh. Father, I want you to be the first to know. Ambrose isn't with us any longer. Oh, really? You mean you already know? Yes, we already know. Why doesn't somebody tell me these things?! Will you be quiet?! Well, what I want to know is how long is mother gonna keep on picking up these tramps? Well, With a son like you, I can quite understand her hobby. Oh, is that so? Yes, that's so. Look at the way she talks to me. Who am I? What do I mean in this family? I might just as well be a total stranger, your boarder. There isn't a kid of -- a man of my acquaintance Who has to put up with what I do. Good morning, my little fishy-wishies. Good morning, mother. Oh, good morning, my dears. And you shall hear the midnight ride of Paul Revere. Oh, Marion, you are so clever. It's a lovely morning -- so bright, so cheerful. So what? Oh, Kane, you are a card. Come on, darling. Sit down and have your breakfast Before your comical children give you indigestion and me a pain in the solar plexus. Here we are, and it's another beautiful morning. It's spring again. I wonder if you've all noticed it. Yes, we've noticed it, dear. It's nice outside, too. When a family has so many blessings, I think there's always a danger of taking things for granted. Grosvenor, don't you think this spoon is a little large for such a tiny, little melon? I'm sorry, madam, but I -- You know, darling, Every night when I go to bed, I search myself? Did you ever find anything? Oh, be quiet. Stop squirming. And so every night as I lie down, I say to myself, "Emily Kilbourne" -- that's my name, you know -- "have you counted your blessings, or are you just taking them for granted?" Mother, dear, listen. There's something I must tell you. Oh, do, dear. Do. Please do, by all means do. It's about Ambrose. Ambrose. Dear Ambrose. Henry, I do wish you'd stop in the bookstore today and get me a copy of Dr. Gillis' new book for Ambrose. It's called -- Stop squirming, dear. What a name for a book. Grosvenor, I want to speak to Ambrose the minute I finish my breakfast. Would you tell him? I have such high hopes for Ambrose. I've given sanctuary to many a fallen man, but not one that I've worked with has ever given me such quick response. Why, do you know, Henry, only yesterday he finished reading Dr. Gillis' "Seek and Ye Shall Find"? Well, he certainly took his literature seriously. Oh, Henry. You are so funny. No, that's not funny, is it? I wonder why I thought it was. Mother, dear, will you listen to me just for one minute? There's something we must tell you. Oh, of course. You wanted to tell me something. You said that before. Go ahead, dear. - Well -- - Don't fidget, Darling. Uh, well, it's just that -- well, there's no use buying Ambrose any more books. What's the use of stalling, Jerry? If you won't tell her, I will. Mother, your pet tramp Ambrose has left. Ambrose has left? Oh, that's preposterous. Why should he go? Because he was a thief, And he walked out with all of our family silver. Kane, you can't know what you're saying. Of course, this -- this is my family's idea of a joke. It's not a joke! It isn't! It's true! Well, if Ambrose did such a thing, he must have had a very good reason. I'll say he did -- the family silver. That makes him a tramp with a silver lining. Oh, do be quiet, And stop squirming! Grosvenor, you don't think Ambrose was angry with us? No one knows what Ambrose might have thought, as later events, I think, have proven. Do I make myself clear, madam? No, you don't, And I don't feel like trying to figure it out now. Grosvenor, you didn't like Ambrose, did you? Answer me, Grosvenor! Answer me! Mother, listen. Mother. There's no use upsetting Grosvenor. He's liable to faint or- or quit or both! Well, I wouldn't care if he did! This household's much too much for me! I know. You're through. But this time it's final! It was he who made Ambrose uncomfortable. Will you stop squirming?! He was always picking on him. Let him quit. Mother, you can't dismiss everybody who doesn't care for your tramps. If you did that, we'd all have to leave. It isn't enough to have the servants against me. My whole family has to turn against me. Sometimes I feel I haven't got a friend in the world! Now see what you've done. There, there, there. Now, don't cry, Emily. After all, Ambrose was just another tramp. Yes, and he didn't respond just the way he should have. I never want to see another one again as long as I live! You take a tramp in -- I mean a man in and offer him a chance to redeem himself, what does he give you? A kick in the pants! Oh, this is more than I can bear! Poor mother. But I hope she means it. No more tramps! Whee! You hear that?? - No more tramps! We've had the last one. Boy, I hope you're right. It's about time. Is it about time for somebody to tell me "stop squirming"? Where's my eggs? Say, dad, it's 8:30! Holy smoke! I'll miss my train! Marion, get my hat. Marion, get pop's hat. Grosvenor, tell Ambrose to get the car! There isn't any more Ambrose, pop! Never mind. I'll drive you. Go that way. Hey, dad, there's something I want to talk to you about. Good morning, Rosa. Good morning, Mr. Kilbourne. Good morning, Etta. Good morning, Mr. Kilbourne. Good morning, Grosvenor. Oh, I saw you before, didn't I? Well, goodbye, then. May I have a word with you, Miss Geraldine? Not now, Grosvenor. I'm in a hurry. Later. Father! Oh, father, dear! Here's your hat! Father, dear, here's your hat. I've simply got to have some money. - Uh, could you -- - No! Oh, but father! Fifty cents wouldn't mean a thing to you, but to me, it means everything! - Hey, sis, can I borrow your car tonight? - No! No, you can't borrow her car! Every time you set foot into it, you get into some kind of trouble. That's right, pop. Thank you. Come on! Wouldn't you?! Wouldn't you save your daughter for 50 cents when it's only a half a buck -- Okay, Garbo. Stop acting. Your audience left. Did you get anything? No. What a family! Hey! Hey! Um, I've had a little trouble. May I use your phone? Definitely not. Good day. Oh, but I- I- I- merely want to, uh... Your persistence will avail you nothing. Now scram. That you, Jerry? Come here quickly, darling. I think I'm going to have babies -- Lots of them. Now, will you get out of here? Why, you're even look worse than the other one did. - Oh, but -- - Grosvenor! Grosvenor, what is all the trouble here? Well, this person was just about to leave, madam. Oh, my poor, dear man. Grosvenor, why don't you ask the gentleman in? Madam, it was my understanding -- Grosvenor. Oh, do come in. You must be very hungry and tired. Hungry and tired -- you are, aren't you? Madam, I don't want to inconvenience you, But, uh, if I might use your phone. Why, of course. Grosvenor, what are you waiting for? Get the gentleman something to eat. Hurry, Grosvenor. Oh, but, really, I -- Do come in. Thank you. My poor, dear Mildred. She's so moody. I'll have to put her in a bowl all by herself. Which is Mildred? Well, let me see where she's got to. There she is -- the pale one. She's been acting so queerly lately. No appetite at all, And this morning, she pretended she doesn't even know me. If, um... If I might use your telephone. Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! Old Ambrose left us. The tramp, he took our silver, too Too, too, Too, too, too -- T-this is, u-um... Oh, what did you say your name was? Rawlins. Oh, Rawlins. This is Marion, my daughter. How do you do? I'd like you to meet my dogs. This dog's name is "Get Off the Rug". His name is "You Too". Isn't he charming, Marion? Well, he's no Robert Taylor. Well, of course not. How could -- whatever your name is -- be Robert Taylor? Don't be foolish. Madam, your telephone? Oh, yes. Of course. Uh, do you drive a car? Well, I did. Oh, but that's wonderful. Ambrose was such a poor driver, they tell me. Mother, if you're thinking of asking this -- this -- Darling, my mother always told me that children should be seen and not heard. Yes, but your mother was smarter than my mother. Well, I know she was, darling. Will you make yourself At home? We'll see what's happening to Grosvenor. Darling, who is Robert Taylor? Hello, Mildred. Come on, get out of here. Get out of here! Scat! - I- I Beg your pardon? - Don't "I beg your pardon" me. Go on. Get out of here. Get out. Get out! Beat it! Beat it! What's the matter? Are you nailed to the floor? - I- I- I don't understand. - Oh, yes, you do. You might impress my mother, but as far as the rest of us are concerned, we don't want any more tramps around here. Now get out. Go on. Get out. You'll make the floor all dirty! Come on. Just a moment, please. I'd like to -- Yes, I know. You would like to find out where the silver is or was -- Will you get out of here?! Young man, don't stand there like a wooden Indian looking for a cigar store! If you had any backbone, you'd -- you'd get out and find yourself a job driving a truck or something. - Did you hear me?! - Yes. - Well, then get out! - Young lady, all I want -- You don't mean to tell me that you have so little self-respect that you'd stay here after what you heard me just say? I don't want to stay here. Ah! The impudence! Oh. So you two have met. - Oh, mother, really, I -- - Oh, yes, indeed. We've had a most interesting conversation. Get him a napkin, Grosvenor. And just what were you talking about? Self-respect. Oh, how perfectly thrilling. Yes, I was telling your daughter how much I admired your social philosophy and, uh, how difficult I find it to understand hers. Why, I'm very, very glad that you understand. When a family has as many blessings as this one has, there's always the danger -- Oh, mother, you said that at breakfast this morning. Oh, did I? How clever of me. Geraldine, the fates are good. He's a splendid chauffeur, aren't you? I doubt it. Oh, but really, if I might just use your telephone. You'll find one in your room. Grosvenor, Rawlins will stay here. Go to the servant's quarters and get him a uniform. But, Mrs. Kilbourne -- Grosvenor, do as you're told. Go along with him. Uh, pardon me. Pardon you?! I- I- I -- - Oh, isn't he delightful? - Oh, mother! Father's going to be perfectly furious! Well, of course. Of course. Mildred! Exhibitionist. Oh! One, two, three, four... Oh, Mildred. Don't you like tramps? I try desperately to love all God's creatures, but I loathe tramps. Your quarters. Here she comes! Oh, good. - Hurry up! - What's he like? Come on, tell us. Did you find out anything about the new tramp? I'll say I did. "Now, if you had any backbone, you'd go out and get yourself a job driving a truck!" "Why, you look even worse than the last one we had here!" "Don't be a wooden Indian!" Why, Rawlins, old boy, if you don't look out, the man with the blue coat and the brass buttons and the funny little hat will come and get you. Come in. And what's more, I have the proof if I need it! Why, Grosvenor, You're white as a sheet! You look like a snowman on a hot day. That man has bats in the belfry! Why? What happened? He's in his room, talking to himself and laughing like a maniac! He says that the man in blue buttons and a brass coat is after him! I tell you, he's stark, staring mad! Hello? Hello? Goodbye! Goodbye. Oh, here! Over here! - Boo! - Aah! Will you get out of here?! You nearly scared the daylights out of me. But I just got some firsthand information. And you'll give it to me, I suppose, if I give you 50 cents. Well, I won't. I'm not interested. Well, I'll tell you anyway. Rawlins is crazy. So are you. Oh, but honest, Jerry! You couldn't be honest! Have you seen my new white hat? Oh, no, sis. I didn't see it. Well, bless my little heart. I found it. Where'd you find it? Why, underneath the cushion here. Hmm. That's funny. It wasn't there when I looked for it. - I guess you didn't look very good. - Yeah. Jerry. What? Who's that out in the garden? How should I know? It's probably the gardener. Get your big feet off my couch! Jerry! Come here! Quick! - Look! - What? Oh! Oh, you startled me! Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, it's quite all right. I don't think I've ever seen you before, have I? Oh, I suppose you're the new chauffeur. Ambrose left us this morning. While I think Nil nisi bonum de mortuis, I'm very glad he's gone. What seemed to be the matter with Ambrose? He sulked constantly. something organic, I think. Sometimes for days on end, he wouldn't speak to me. That went on for days on end. Oh, you must be a very patient woman. I try to be. What beautiful roses. Are you fond of flowers? Oh, yes, indeed. Shakespeare said, "A man who hath no music in himself," And so forth. I think he might also have said, "A man who hath no flowers within himself," and so forth. Do you know anything about diseases? Uh, not very much. I had the mumps once, But that was a long time ago, of course. No, my dear man. I mean diseases of roses. Oh! Oh, I am so sorry. Evergreen spray is what they need. I'll get you some today, if I may. That's very kind of you. Here comes Geraldine. Mother, darling, I'm gonna go over to the -- Jerry, this is our new chauffeur, Mr. "What's His Name... I didn't catch the name. Weary Willie? Rawlins. Wade Rawlins. Oh, Wade Rawlins. My great-grandmother was a Wade. What was your father's name? Mother, darling, it's probably not the same family. Come along, Rawlins. Excuse me. Where are you going, darling? Rawlins is going to drive me to the club. Oh, does he drive? Oh, my poor, darling roses. I don't know what your game is, but you certainly won't get away with it. - You can believe me. - Oh, I believe you. You won't like it around here at all, I warn you. Well, the atmosphere is a bit chilly. Shall I drive? What had you intended to do, sit on the radiator cap? Well, I- I really hadn't thought, But if- if you'd like I -- Oh, come back here, you idiot. Open the door. Let's hurry. Well... You're certainly very well-mannered, I must say. I- I'm so sorry. Whew! Rather fatiguing, being a chauffeur. I have a book you ought to read. A mystery story? It will be to you. It's a book on etiquette. Oh, it should be amusing. Hope it has pictures. I love pictures. You can park right there. I won't be long. Don't you know how to drive? If you take the trouble to look occasionally, You'd notice that there are other people driving cars beside yourself. I assure you, it was quite unavoidable. Although I think when you saw me trying to back up, You might have waited a moment before parking. Don't give me that. The trouble is there are too many fellas like you -- What are you trying to do, be funny?! I'm trying to see the rest of your number. Ah, that's better. Thank you. You mean to say I'm to blame? Yes, I think so. You can't talk like that to me. I'll knock your ears off! Oh, don't frighten me, mister. Look -- you've got me all nervous. All right, I'll make you nervous. Come on. Get out of that car. Is something wrong, Herbert? Ah, this chauffeur's a little too fresh, And I'm gonna put him in his place. Come on! Get out of there! Boo! - Why, you! - Wheeler! Wheeler! You're making a fool of yourself! Wheeler, use your head! I'll show him he can't get fresh with me and get away with it! Herbert Wheeler! Jerry. I'm sorry, Jerry, but the chauffeur -- - Other fella's fault again, wasn't it, Herbert? - Oh, well, look, Jerry -- I think this is all quite unnecessary. - But, Jerry -- - I have nothing further to say to you. - Home, Rawlins. - I'll call you at home. Do! I won't be there! It, uh, was a most unfortunate incident. Yes, Herbert has -- I mean, Mr. Wheeler has a faculty for creating unfortunate incidents. Well, it wasn't wholly his fault. Now, don't go heroic on me. I can repair the damage myself. Sometimes I think he could do with a bit of damaging. Why, I didn't mean that. I was referring to the damage on the car. Yes, I know. But I still think my idea is a good one. Right. Right. No, I mean turn right. Oh! Tell me, just how did it happen? It was an unavoidable accident. Rawlins, I think you're a -- well, a fibber, But I can't say that I don't appreciate you for it. Thank you. Welcome. Um...you're not going to leave me standing like this, are you? Oh, I'm glad you reminded me. Go to a garage and have the bumper fixed. And, uh, pick up father at the station. He arrives at 5:00. Um, what's your father like? Well, let's see. He's, um... Well, he's very bad-tempered, and he hates tramps. For further information, I'd ask mother. She's known him longer. Y-y-yes, But, u-uh, well... ...is he tall, short, wide, narrow, or...? Well, that depends on how you look at him. Miss Kilbourne, how will I know him? I've already told you. He arrives at 5:00. Oh, a-at 5:00? Oh! Yes. Yes, of course. That's different. Well, aren't you going to have the car fixed? I knew there was something I had to do. Just a moment, please. I think I hear her coming now, sir. It's for you, miss. Who is it, Grosvenor? Mr. Wheeler, miss. Oh, it is? Tell Mr. Wheeler I'm not at home. Miss Kilbourne is not at home, sir. Listen, you stupid, old fool. Who do you think you're kidding? What did you call me, Herbert? Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart. Listen, baby -- I beg your pardon, sir, But I'm neither your sweetheart nor your baby. Baby, you baby elephant! Will you get off the phone, you big lug?! Why, Herbert, I thought you wanted to talk to me. But if that's the way you feel about it... Uh, b-but w-wait a minute, Jerry. Tell Mr. Wheeler I'm not at home. Hello? This is the Kilbourne estate. Will you please stop monkeying around And let me talk to Miss Kilbourne?! Miss Kilbourne is not at home, sir. Listen, you fathead, I know she's at home! I just talked to her! Are you going to believe who you've talked to or what I tell you? Miss Kilbourne is not at home. H-hello? Grosvenor? Jerry? Grosvenor? This is the operator speaking. What number are you calling, please? Operator, I was disconnected. So sorry to have kept you waiting. Just a moment. Here's Miss Kilbourne now. Mr. Kilbourne? Mr. Kilbourne! Will you stop shouting my name all over this platform and get back to the car? Oh, Harris, Tonight's the night, you know? Yes, we know. We're gonna make it At Sam's house. His wife's out of town. Tramp? Yes. You stolen anything yet? Not yet. Only got here this morning. Anything else, sir? I hope everything was satisfactory, sir. If you need me, you'll call me? Thank you very much, sir. First it was James, then it was Harold, Then it was I don't know who, And now you've got this -- this... Rawlins. Wade Rawlins. Oh, yes, yes. Wade Rawlins. Thanks. I won't stand for it any longer. This foolishness has gone far enough. How do you suppose our friends and neighbors feel? What's that, dear? I said, "How do you suppose our friends and neighbors feel?" Why? Were any of them ill? How do I know? If you ask me, and I'm sure you won't, I think Rawlins has great possibilities. He's nothing but a presumptuous pup. Don't you think so, Grosvenor? I would rather not discuss that person, sir, But since you asked me, I think he's suffering from dementia personalis. He means he thinks he's nuts. Now, you look a little stuck, pop. Here, Grosvenor. Do something with this. The sooner this family realizes That we're being made the laughingstock of this community and the sooner they come to their senses, then and only then will I enjoy the comforts I'm entitled to In this house. Grosvenor, have you got a match, please? I'm surprised the tramps we've had in the past Haven't stolen our furniture. They've taken most everything else. I'm not going to stand for it any longer. I'm putting a stop to it right here and now. This has got to end once and for all. I won't have it, And nobody's going to change my mind this time. If we need a chauffeur, we'll hire a chauffeur, like most sensible people do. I've let this nonsense go far enough. James. James. This one time, I'm going to have my way, and that's final! Will you stop whatever you're doing, Grosvenor, And get me another cup of coffee? Now, where was I? Between a presumptuous pup and a cup of coffee. Oh, yes. Thanks. Now, getting back to what's his name -- - Rawlins. - Who's doing this, you or I? Go ahead, dad. You do it. You bet I will, and immediately. Now, what was it? Stop playing with those dogs! Yes, sir. Jeremiah Bourne married Eliza Wade, And they begat Cordelia, Ophelia, and Peter. I have a feeling that Peter is where Rawlins comes in. I wish I could remember his father's name. Yet it couldn't be Peter, Because he didn't begat anything. Well, who knows? Maybe he didn't have a father. Oh, darling. Everyone has a father. That's one of nature's unwritten laws. Emily, what are you talking about? Wade Rawlins, dear. The new chauffeur. You see, my great-grandmother was a Wade. What a family. I know. They were quite remarkable, darling. Hey, pop, I need 50 cents in the worst way. Well, you won't get it that way or any other way. I think now it must be Ophelia. Ophelia? Why, yes. My great aunt Ophelia. Peter had no issue, But Ophelia did. After she had her third child, she was never quite the same. Well, anyway, crazy or not, That tramp leaves here the first thing in the morning, And that's that. Say, pop, let's play a game of rummy. Not tonight, dear. Papa's going straight to bed. He's very tired. Good night, all. - Night. - Good night. - Night, dad. How about it, Kane? No, sir. I'm going to bed, too. - Night, mom. - Night, darling. What was your father disturbed about, darling? Oh, nothing much, dear. He just wanted to kick out Rawlins. - Why? - Did he steal anything? Mm, not yet. Well, I certainly think he's entitled to the same opportunities that Ambrose had. Good night, dear. Going to bed, darling? No, I feel bored enough to go out with Herbert Wheeler. Oh, that's lovely, darling. Good night. Here we are. The end of the line! Everybody out! Here we are, folks! Yippee! How much do I owe you? $15. Maybe you better let me help you. You're a fine fellow. Well, thanks. Here. Oh, you said $15. Here. Shh! Thanks very much. Hey! What's the big idea?! Yeah, what's the big idea?! Is he a friend of yours? No! I'm Rawlins, Mr. Kilbourne. Oh, hi, Mr. Rawlins. Now, just how much does he owe you? 15 bucks, And what's it to you? Now, beat it! Say, you can't talk to my friend that way! Shh. You'll wake the household, Mr. Kilbourne. Yeah, and you can't shush me, either! Hey, what are you trying to do, make a chump out of me? Yeah, and you can't take a sock at me and get away with it! I'll knock your block off! Hey, don't pick on that old man! Come on. Get out of here. Now beat it! Keep quiet! What are you trying to do?! Wake up the whole neighborhood? Hey, w-wait a minute! What are -- w-what are you trying to do now? Shh! Shh! Who's there? It's Rawlins, Mrs. Kilbourne. Some person who had been drinking Insisted that he lived here. And did he? Oh, I got rid of him, all right. I'm awfully sorry he woke you up. Well, if he comes back again, don't let him in. Good night. Good night. Mr. Kilbourne! Mr. Kilbourne! Wake up! Who are you? I'm Rawlins, Mr. Kilbourne. How do you do, Mr. Rawlins? What can I do for you? I want to help you into the house. I don't need your help, and I never will. Here. Help me get up. What are you doing here? I was only trying to assist you, Mr. Kilbourne. I don't need your assistance. Got your key? What's your name? Rawlins. Oh. Yeah. Rawlins, old boy, I like you, and I always did. You're a friend if there ever was one. And what's better to a friend than a friend?! Shh! Who are you trying to shh? Let's be a little more quiet. - Yes, that's a keen idea. - Oh, all right. I don't need your help. How did you get up here?! Why, I- I -- Shh! Well... I think I'll go to bed. Good night. Good night. What are you doing up so late, young lady? Everyone else was prowling all around the house. Why shouldn't I? Well, I think you'd better go to bed. Okay. And I don't need Your help, either. I'm sober. Come on, pups. Listen, Marion. I think for the benefit of all concerned, We'd better forget about tonight. I don't forget so easy. - I think you'd better go to bed. - Okay. Good night, Rawlins. Good night. Gee, I bet I could go for you. Don't you like me just a little bit? Oh, why, I'm crazy about you. You're my little sweetheart. Oh, Wade! Oh, I forgot something. Would you take "Get Off the Rug,, and "You Too" out for a walk? At your service, madame. Go on, baby. Go on. Go on. Come on, pups. Quiet, "You too"! And I mean you, too, "Get Off the Rug"! Come on. Jerry... Aw, the way you act, you'd think we were total strangers. Herbert, I've told you a thousand times I don't like being mauled. I wish you wouldn't be so persistent. Well, a fella likes to feel that his girlfriend thinks enough of him to want a kiss him once in a while. Well, then, maybe you better get yourself another girlfriend, because I just don't feel like being kissed. I told you I didn't want to be kissed! Good night, Herbert. Good night, Geraldine. Sorry if I appeared too romantic. Good morning. What are you doing up this late? Oh, I always take the dogs out at this time of night. You always -- But this is your first night here. Oh, well, I always take them out starting tonight. You weren't by any chance snooping on Mr. Wheeler and me? Why, I- I- I was just walking the dogs. That's not answering my question. Why, of course not. But that was a beautiful wallop you gave him. Yes, wasn -- Good night. Come on, pups. Well, where do you think you're going? Well, I have to get "Get Off the Rug" in and "You Too,, in and you in, too. I'll see that they get in. - Good night. - Good night. Well, why don't you go? Oh, but I- I couldn't do that until I've seen you safely in. Don't worry about me. Oh. Very well. If that's the way you feel about it... - Good night. - Good night. Is that the way you always walk? Yes. Oh, I don't care about where I'm going. I like to see where I've been. Rawlins... Yes, ma'am? - I have no key. - No key? No key. What'll I do? Um...well, why not try one of the windows? Aren't they a bit high? Oh, I think we'll manage. There you are. I couldn't possibly climb that high. Oh, there's nothing to it. Look. I'll show you. Get up there, "Get Off the Rug". "You Too,,. See? Simple, isn't it? I don't think so, but I'll try. You see? I can't do it. Well, may I help you? Oh! I can't reach it! No, I can't. Oh, that's funny. You know, I would have sworn you could have made it. Well, it's, uh, much higher up here than you think. Oh, well. Let's try this way. What are you laughing at? - You look like ,,Get Off the rug,,. - Oh, come on. Get up on my back, and I'll raise you up to the window. I'm afraid. It's dangerous. Oh, come, come, now. This position isn't very comfortable, you know. All right. There you are. Now you just turn around, and you're home. - Thank you. - Good night. Good night. Yoo-hoo! Rawlins! Now what? My purse. Thank you. Oh, uh... My keys. I must have had them all the time. - Good night. - Good night. Yoo-hoo! Rawlins! Is that man here again? No, Mrs. Kilbourne. He's gone. Oh, well, if he comes back again, Don't let him in, will you? Good night. Good night. Breakfast is ready! Breakfast is ready! Come and get it! Breakfast is ready! Breakfast is ready! Come and get it! Whee! Good morning, "Get Off the Rug,,. That's it. Good morning, "You Too". Good morning, fishy-wishies. Good morning, Dopey. Good morning, "Screwy',. Top of the morning to you, Grosvenor. Miss Marion, if ever you play a trick again With those chimes, I'll -- Hold it. I'll go get your milk immediately, Miss Marion. Now, wait a minute, Grosvenor. Stand over there by the bird. You, too, Marion. All right. Now smile. That's it. Now look sad. Watch the birdie, Dopey. Watch the birdie.. That's it. But, Jerry, you didn't wind the film. Oh, be quiet. There's no film in the camera. But how can you take pictures without film, miss? Oh, you can't. I'm just trying it. If I like it, I'll buy some film. Yes, ma'am. Morning, sour puss. - What's that?! - Now, now, now, Kane. Don't be mean to your little sister. Answer her. She said, "good morning, sour puss." Why don't you leave me alone? Why don't you stop being a baby? Oh, I ought to -- I ought to slap your - Yes, you might do it once, but you'll never do it again! Why is she always getting fresh with me?! I never liked him, and I always will! Well, I certainly don't care for you! Come on. Kiss and make up. There. Now, isn't that better? As far as I'm concerned, he's still a sour puss. - How do you like that? - Here comes pop. Morning, pop. - Morning, dad. - Morning. Pop, if anyone tells you you look good this morning, slug 'em. Say, Kane, you know what my music teacher wants me to sing this afternoon? Listen. Shut up! Shut up! Who am I supposed to take orders from around this joint, anyway? Grosvenor, give father some black coffee - and a couple of aspirin. - Yes, ma'am. If I want any aspirin, I'll order my own aspirin! Get me a couple of aspirin. Right in front of you, sir. Well, get them. Never mind. I'll get them myself. Say, pop, See those great big mice walking along the table? Mice? I don't see any mice. Well, I thought you might this morning. Young lady, I'll have you know there's nothing wrong with me this morning! Of course not, Marion. Those aren't mice. they're Shetland ponies. Morning, mother. Good morning, my dears. Oh, never mind, mother. I said good morning to your fishies for you. Oh, thank you, dear. So thoughtful. - Morning, Marion. - Morning, Jerry. Morning, Kane. Morning, Jerry. Please stop! Listen to me, all of you. I have a few words I want to say. We will now hear from the head of the house. Take it, dad! Attaboy, pop! We want to hear! Listen to me! I never ask very much of this family, And tonight, as you know, We're entertaining Senator Harlan, his wife, and his daughter. The Senator may mean nothing to any of you, but it so happens he's very important to me and my business. Do I make myself clear? Perfectly, sir. What?! I beg your pardon. So tonight... For once in your lives... please try to act like adults. Or is that asking too much of you? Dad's right. We owe it to him. Now, Marion, remember -- None of your sneezing powders and tricks and things. This is no time for joking! I'm not joking, pop. You can count on us. And another thing, Emily. I insist on your getting rid of Rawlins. Oh! Why, Henry! Oh. Oh, that's too bad. I hate to see Rawlins go. He's been trying so hard. Why, last night, He was up half the night, Wasn't he, Jerry? Yes, he wa-- How do I know? Leave me out of this. Why, yes. He was up shooing drunks away. Where they came from, heaven knows. I don't think he's so bad. As a matter of fact, I think he's doing very well. You ought to know. What do you mean I ought to know? And I don't want any answers, either. Well, I don't care anything about that. I want him out of here before I get home tonight. Holy smoke! I'm late again. What on earth's the matter with you this morning, Henry? There's nothing in the world the matter with me. Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle! Oh, no, Rawlins. You must always serve from the left. This is your left, Madam. So it is. I- I get mixed up sometimes. You see, I'm right-handed. Well, I was pretending I was a left-handed butler. Oh, that's different. Then you're doing splendidly. Thank you, Mrs. Kilbourne. Now serve Mr. Kilbourne. Um, which is Mr. Kilbourne? That's he at the head of the table. Uh, want some salad? Heavens no! Not that way! Oh, that would never do. Let me show you. Now, I'll be Mr. Kilbourne, and you be me. No, you'll be me, and I'll be Mr. Kilbourne. Or you'll be Mr. Kilbourne, and I'll be you. That's it. Now, who are we? Well, sit down here. Now, I'm coming out of the kitchen door. This is the kitchen door, isn't it? - Yes. - Yes. Now, here I come. Oh, you're not supposed to be looking at me. - You're talking to the guests. - Oh. I'll start over again. Uh, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter. Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter. Oh, what did you say? Oh, yes. Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter. Chatter, chatter, chatter. Will you please raise your left hand? Thank you. Is everything all right, dear? Oh, dear. I called you dear. I was pretending you were Mr. Kilbourne -- My husband, you know? Oh, yes. Uh, Mr. Kilbourne. Nothing you can say will make any difference now! A tramp has ruined my career! My decision is final! Grosvenor, you can't leave in the middle of all this. Oh, can't I? I work your fingers to the bone for this party, And Mrs. Kilbourne allows him to usurp my position. I won't stand for it, I tell you! I'm through! And don't tell me I've said that before. But you can't desert until after dessert! Say, that's pretty good, huh? But what about your paycheck? Well... I'll do the sporting thing. I'll wait until after dinner. But remember, I'm still mad! Remember that, will you? Anything else, Mrs. Remington? No, thank you, Rawlins. That's fine. I'm sure Mrs. Remington will like you, And I'm sure you'll like Mrs. Remington. But you won't like her husband. Oh. I'm so sorry. Mother, darling, I had the most awful shock -- Oh. It's you. Well, I think it is. Gee, Jerry, doesn't he look pretty? Marion, a man never looks pretty. He looks handsome. Oh. So you noticed it, too? How charming you look, Miss Kilbourne. Oh, thank you! It's my new dress. Do you like it, Rawlins? Oh, yes. and you look charming, too. I've been showing Rawlins how to serve. I'm sure he's going to do beautifully. Thank you, madam. Yes, I think he'll do, too. Thank you. Well, we're all ready for our guests. Darling, that's what I wanted to tell you. Eddie Moran can't come, So we'll have to remove one place, And we'll only 13 at table. 13?! But that's terrible! It's unheard of! Eddie Moran can't do that to us! But, darling, he's had an accident. He broke a leg. Well, that's no excuse. Grandfather Wade wore crutches for years and never missed a meal. Yes, dear. I know. And what do you mean by sitting down in Mrs. Kilbourne's presence? Well, I always sit down when I'm driving her. What's that got to do with it? I don't know. What do you think? I think you look grand. Ah. Yes, he does look rather -- Well, never mind about that! Everything's going wrong here! - Now, look here, you. - Mr. Rawlins. Look here, Mr. Rawlins, I -- I mean, if the Kilbourne's choose to fraternize with their inferiors, that's their privilege, but I'll have you know -- That if he's elected, he promises you bigger and better people to fraternize with! I wouldn't expect a mere artisan like a cook to know any better. Do I make myself clear? - No. - Perfectly. And I also want you to remember that that's my suit that you're wearing. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Very grateful. And if you get so much as one spot on it, I'll... - You'll what? - I'll... I'll make you pay for the cleaning. Come in. Kilbourne residence? Yes. I'm Reynolds from the agency. You're late. What kept you? Blowout. What shall I do with this stuff? Put it in the closet there. Where do I work? Front door. Hey, Reynolds. You forgot your rubbers. Oh, no, I didn't. They're on. I- I'd like to speak to Rawlins. Oh. Oh, Rawlins. This is Mrs. Kilbourne. Mrs. Kilbourne, haven't you a cold? Oh, well, it must be the telephone. Your voice sounds so youthful. I'm in terrible trouble, Rawlins. Poor, dear Marion, she has to eat in her room. And I don't want to eat in my roo-- oh! Now, look here, young lady, What do you expect me to do about it? I'm very busy now helping Grosvenor. Really, mother does want to see you. She told me to call you. Now, Marion Kilbourne, if you're fibbing... If you think I'm fibbing, then just don't come! But I tell you, she wants to see you and -- and it's up to you whether you come or not. It seems Mrs. Kilbourne wishes to see me about something. Look after things while I'm gone. Yes, sir. "Sir"? Ha! Who do I think he is? Minerva Harlan! I'm so glad you could come. You look such a darling. That European trip of yours did you a world of good. Thank you, Mrs. Kilbourne. But I haven't been to Europe in five years. Oh, how delightful. Where's the Senator and your mother? I drove my own car, but mother and dad will be along presently. You'll find Geraldine in the cocktail room. I'll let her take care of you. Aren't you going to introduce me to this charming stranger? This? Oh, this is Rawlins. How do you do, Mr. Rawlins? I'm Minerva Harlan. - Oh, but, uh, I -- - Yes, Rawlins. This is Minerva Harlan. Do you know each other? Well, not yet, but, um, it won't take long. You can start being nice to me right away. You can lead me to the cocktail room. Oh, but pardon me just a moment. I think Mrs. Kilbourne wants to speak to me about something. No, Rawlins. I don't want to speak to you. Good. You can take me to the cocktail room. But, uh, you don't understand. Oh, I do understand. A Harlan always gets her man. Aren't you well? I'm all right. Oh, you don't look very well. I think a little milk would do you good. Here you are. Here's to us. Oh, but, uh, I'm not supposed to drink. Oh, what's the matter? Can't you take it? Oh, yes, yes. It's not that. It's, uh... You know, the Senator doesn't go out very often, only with close friends. Miss Harlan, I wish you'd let me explain about myself. I know everything about you I need to know -- Not too young, much too handsome. Oh. I... Old-fashioned enough to blush and unattached. You are unattached, aren't you? Oh, yes, yes. Good. He's unattached, and I saw him first. Minerva, darling... I'm so happy to see you. Well, then, look at me. At a time like this? Mrs. Remington, I want you to know Mr. Rawlins. But not too well. Well, how do you do? How do you do? Do you mind if I have a sip? O-oh, no. Please. Why, he's going to -- He may not mind, but I do. Well, good luck. Anything wrong, Mr. Kilbourne? No, no, no. But... Oh, well... You're doing pretty well for someone not supposed to drink. I expect a bad cold. If you ladies will excuse me, I must see Mrs. Kilbourne. It's very important. Now don't go away! Did you have a pleasant trip? Oh, we had a lovely time. Oh, where did you go? Kansas City. Oh, how quaint. You'll find the others in the cocktail room. Thank you. Mrs. Kilbourne. Oh, how nice of you to come. But I've been here. I'm Rawlins. Well, of course you are. I know that. I never forget a face or a name. Don't be silly. I'm very glad you came. Mrs. Kilbourne, isn't there something you wanted me to do? No, Rawlins. Oh, so you must see Mrs. Kilbourne. Very important. Mrs. Kilbourne, your Mr. Rawlins is a naughty boy. Oh, how nice. Oh, Mrs. Harlan. And Senator Harlan, I'm so happy you could come. Not at all, not at all. Glad to be here. Oh, mother and dad, this is Mr. Rawlins. Isn't he handsome and grand? Glad to know you, Mr. Rawlins. Oh, your daughter's too generous, sir. Be careful, young man. When Minerva's nice, she's usually looking for something. Look here, Emily. Oh, good evening, Mrs. Harlan. How do you do? How do you do, Senator? I'm glad to see you again. Good evening. Glad to see you. Well, uh, I think if you don't mind, I'll go. No, you don't. Father, tell this man to stop running away from me. Mr. Rawlins, stop running away from my daughter. Senator, how about a little... Oh, no. Take him in and give him a drink instead. Minerva wants one, too. Come along, mom. Come on, dad. I'll buttle till the butler comes along. - Will you have one? - Thank you. - Will you? - No, thanks. - Well, you're two up on me... - Well, now... Hello, Senator Harlan. Good evening, Geraldine. How are you? Hello, Mrs. Harlan. Of course, you know the Flemings. Yes. Of course. And this is Mrs. Remington, Mrs. Harlan. And, uh, that's Mr. Remington, Mrs. Harlan. How do you do? I'm Mrs. Kilbourne. Oh, mother. Hello, pop. Hello, everybody. Hello, Wade. Having a nice time? Wonderful, thanks. Give me a slug of ginger ale -- straight. Marion, dear... Daddy wants to talk to you. Take it easy, dad. Remember my age. Marion Kilbourne, if I find you had anything to do with bringing Rawlins into this party as a guest, I'll skin you alive. Why, daddy, dear, how could you ever suspect me of doing such a thing? Now, you listen to me. If you so much as open your mouth the rest of this night, I'll tan you good. Good evening, Mr. Kilbourne. Oh, how are you, Herbert? - Hello, Marion. - Hello, Herb. You'll find Jerry in there. Well, thanks. Excuse me. Now, remember -- not a word. No matter what happens, you keep your mouth shut. Can't I even open it to eat? Yes. Only to eat, and that's all. - Hello, John. - Hello, Herb. Why, Herbert! Hello! How are you? I'm so glad you're here. Here. Here's a drink. We're awfully glad to see you. Well, you know I couldn't stay away, honey. Still mad at me? Mad at you? Of course not. Why should I be? Another cocktail, Senator? Oh, thank you, Mr. Rawlins. Jerry, isn't that Rawlins, your chauffeur? Why, uh, yes -- Come on. Come on. Quit stalling. What's the idea? What's he doing here? Shh. I'll tell you. It's a long, uninteresting story, and I'm sure it would bore you stiff. - Now, would you care not to hear it? - What's he doing here? I thought so. Come on. Calm down. Drink your drink. Why, it's ridiculous. After all, the man's a tramp! What are these people going to say when they find out about it? Herbert, you're the only one who knows him here. Remember, you're meeting Wade Rawlins for the first time tonight. Dinner is served, madam. Mind the little step. Follow me, everybody. I know where it is. Governor, do you really like radishes? You can't get away with this! Get back to the kitchen. Don't worry about me. I'm doing all right. - What did you say? - I was talking to Grosvenor. And whenever you are in Washington, You must come and visit us. Thank you so much, but I was there once. It was during the last coronation. Senator, you're on my right. No, here, here, Senator. Mrs. Harlan, you're down there, next to Henry. And, Jerry, you're here, darling. And Herbert, Mrs. Remington. Kay, you're there, dear. Mrs. Fleming. And Mr. Remington. Minerva, darling, you sit here. Marion, come over here, darling, and Mr. Fleming is there. Rawlins, you don't belong here. Oh. Y- y- you're here. Oh, I haven't any place for you. Oh, dear, dear. Senator, I can't tell you how glad we are to have you here tonight. I say, Rawlins, I, uh... I didn't recognize you without your uniform. Oh, no? Wheeler and I fought together in the Great War. Oh, if I only didn't have to serve that person again. Oh, boy. If I had a tuxedo, I'd serve him. Oh, what I could do to his tuxedo if it weren't mine. Say, Kilbourne, They tell me there's a very eccentric woman in this district. It seems she has a hobby of inviting hobos into her home and trying to reform them. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? Ha ha! Supposing one was sitting right here. Now, what would be the topic of his conversation? What would he say? What would we say? Well, it's hard to imagine unless the tramp, or hobo, as you call him, was a victim of circumstances. Bosh! A tramp is a tramp. He's what he is because he wants to be. He's indolent, and a menace to society. Do you golf, Wade? You don't mind if I call you Wade. - Oh, no. Of course not. I'm sorry, sir -- - You mean you don't play? No, I mean I don't mind you calling me Wade. Yes, I do play golf. Minerva, I'm talking to Mr. Rawlins. But, surely, Senator -- That's wonderful. Would you call me tomorrow? Yes, of course. Thank you. Then you believe that a tramp, if given the opportunity, will give up what he calls his comforts and accept a job that requires the use of his brain or hands? Well, of course. Ha! I doubt it. Oh, but I'm sure of it. Now, for instance. Take me. Don't take him! I- I mean... Has anybody been up to the Canadian Rockies lately? Children, children, remember. We promised to act like adults in front of the Senator. Minerva, tell us about your cousin who graduated from Fort Wayne School for Lady Dentists. Senator, tell me more about the woman who is nuts. And that's my own belief. Of course, that's off the record. Oh, thank you for your confidence, Senator. You can trust me. I thought so. Oh, by the way, You're closely associated with Kilbourne, aren't you? I, um -- I try to help him as much as I can in my humble way, you know? Then, uh, confidentially... What do you think of this bond issue of his? Bond... oh, oh. The bond issue. Yes. Well, all I can say is if Mr. Kilbourne is interested in it, it's good enough for me. - Oh, Willie?? - Yes. Time to go. So it is. So it is. So it is. Well, good night, young man. I've enjoyed the discussion immensely. Thank you, Senator. So have I. We had such a grand time, Mrs. Kilbourne. The dinner was perfectly lovely. Oh, I'm so glad you could all come. Because if you hadn't, I don't know what we'd have done with all the food. Good night. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Emily, there's something I've been trying to tell you all evening. Oh, Henry! There you are! Where have you been? We've had the loveliest party. For heaven's sakes, Emily, I know all about the party. You do? Tell me all about it. How was it? Oh, forget it. Forget it! Well, I'll try, but I doubt it very much. Boo! You may go home now. Good night. That Rawlins certainly put your family in a spot. Why, if this ever gets out, you'll be the -- But it won't get out, Herbert, unless you let it out. Well, if I were your father, I'd not only throw him out of the house, But I'd see that he leaves town. If you ask me, he's nothing but a conniv-- But no one has asked you, Herbert. It's been a lovely evening. Thanks to you, Wade. Yes, I've enjoyed it, too. I'll call you in the morning. All right. Good night. Good night. You look so beautiful tonight, Jerry. Thank you, Herbert. I think you'd better be going now -- Oh, please, let me stay just a few minutes longer. Come on, Jerry. It's past your bedtime. Good night, Herbert. Say, what's the idea? Did you forget something, Herbert? My name's Mr. Wheeler. And I haven't forgotten anything. Oh. Good night, Mr. Wheeler. Good night, Herbert. You didn't mind my calling you Jerry, did you? I don't know why I should. Miss Harlan didn't mind when you called her Minnie. Oh. Oh, didn't she? I didn't notice. Jerry, did anybody tell you you look beautiful this evening? Yes. Nobody did. I mean, thank you, Wade. Two three-minute eggs, toast, coffee, and marmalade. Is that all? Thank you, sir. Oh, uh, may I ask who this is, please? Two three-minute eggs. That's six minutes. Oh, give me a couple of eggs, And fix the tray for the guest in the blue room. Grosvenor didn't say anything about a guest. Oh, no. He figures what we don't know won't hurt him, or something like that. Not a decent word. Not even a "good morning." I don't know how I've stayed in this place as long as I have. It must be your personality and sweet disposition. Never mind about my sweet dispo-- Who's that for? That's for whoever the guest is in the blue room, if I'm not too inquisitive. - Guest in the blue room? - Mm-hmm. Guest in the blue room? Guest in the blue room. Why, it's impossible. It's preposterous. I haven't been officially informed. Who do they think is running this house anyway? Besides, there can't be a guest in the blue room. Oh, there can't, eh? Then a ghost just called down, and he's hungry. You see? That's another example Of what I have to put up with in this house. Last night, it was the unspeakable Rawlins. Me, a Grosvenor, having to wait on a lowly -- Don't you dare say anything about Mr. Rawlins, or I'll run you out of here with a meat ax! Give me the eggs. Go lie down for a couple of minutes. They're not ready. Meat ax. Marion, dear, You're exceptionally quiet this morning. Is anything the matter? Oh, I had a tough day at the office. Oh, Marion. Isn't she funny, Jerry? No. Grosvenor, here we are. Where are you going? I believe it's customary to inform the butler if there are to be guests. Guests? Where? In the blue room, sir. He's just ordered breakfast. Well, did he ask for it cold? Did you invite anybody, dad? Who could it be? Henry, dear, are you sure Aunt Sophia left last month? I wonder if they could be any hangovers left from last night's party. Only father's. Isn't there any respect at all in this family? Don't get discouraged, pop. There must be. If you're all so curious to know who the guest is, why don't you go up and see? Well, you're the head man in this family, so you claim. Why don't you go up and see? By golly, I will. By golly, let's all go. By golly, lets. By golly. See who it is. Hey, dad, you tackle him. We're right behind you. Come in. Good morn-- Good morning. Will you bring the tray here? And I'd like the morning paper, please. There must be some mistake. Who is it? I've never been so shocked in all my life, sir. It's Rawlins, sitting up in bed as big as you please. - Rawlins?! - It's Rawlins! What's he doing in there? Waiting for me to serve his breakfast, And he had the effrontery to ask for your newspaper. Oh, he wanted my newspaper, eh? Well, I'll see that he gets it. Rawlins, eh? What the blazes are you doing in here? - Oh, good morning, Mr. Kilbourne. Come in. - I am in. Isn't it enough that you almost completely ruined me last night? Now get your clothes on and get out. Have you got a cigarette? I said, "get out"! Mr. Kilbourne, last night, I was placed in a predicament which was just as embarrassing for me as it must have been for you. What do you mean? I mean having to act the part of a guest. That was last night. This is another day. Right, but now, naturally, I can't go back to being your chauffeur. - Uh, match? - You bet you can't. Therefore, I must either stay your guest... or leave. Well, that's settled. Now, go. Oh, very well. If that's the way you feel about it, I'll go. But promise me one thing -- Don't you ever let Senator Harlan know that he sat down to dinner in your house with a tramp. It might affect your deal. Well, never mind Senator Harlan. Get out! Do you hear bells? Hello? Who's calling? Who? Oh, just a moment, Miss Harlan. It's for you. It's Miss Harlan. Perhaps you'd better tell her I'm not here or that I've left or that you were just going to throw me out. Hello, Minerva, I was just going to -- Say, I can't tell her that. You talk to her. As you wish. Good morning, Miss Harlan. She wants me to call her Minerva. Well, then, call her Minerva. Good morning, Minerva. Oh, no, no. I'm alone. Oh, that was the radio. Somebody making animal noises, I think. Dad's going to drop me off at the golf course on his way into town. You can use his clubs. Besides, he wants to talk to you. Oh, the Senator wants to talk to me. Well, really, Minerva, I don't know whether or not I can make it. Yeah, of course you can make it. Of course you can make it. Of course I can make it. Of course I can make it. Grosvenor, what are you standing there for? Take Mr. Rawlins' breakfast in to him. See that he gets what he wants, and if you say anything about resigning, I'll throw you out of the house. Say, what's happened to pop? Will that be all? Yes, that's all, my good man. Oh, hello, Grosvenor. Where's Rawlins? Oh, there you are. Good morning, Mrs. Kilbourne. My, my. I do believe you're going to be the complete vindication of my theory. Oh, thank you, Mrs. Kilbourne. Oh, boy, Wade. You're the cats. How does it feel to be a guest? Well, it's a very interesting experience. I'll bet you tell that to all your hostesses. Oh, Jerry wanted me to find out if you wouldn't care to play golf with her. Oh, I'd love to. Oh, but, uh, I just arranged to play with Miss Harlan. Goody, goody, goody! But if she likes, we could make it a threesome. She wouldn't like it, I hope. Shakespeare was right when he said -- Well, I've forgotten what he said, but Shakespeare was right. Bon appétit. Oh, boy, What a drive! I wish I could hit a ball as far as that. Oh, there's no reason in the world why you shouldn't. What you need most of all is to loosen up. Oh, I'll never get out of this trap. Will you stop whistling? It makes me nervous. Wouldn't kid me, would you? I know what's making you nervous. I can't use the niblick. Well, you mustn't ground your club, of course. Here, here. Let me show you. Now... Now play it off your right foot. No, now, don't look at me. Keep your eye on the ball. Now, take sand just behind the ball and follow right through, see? Hey, wait a minute, sis. They haven't had their second shot yet. You're liable to hit somebody. That's just what I had in mind. Hey, where are you going? Home. This course is too crowded for me. Well, hardly anybody's playing. It's still too crowded for me. Aw, Jerry! Hello. Hello. Been swimming? Swim-- no. golfing. Where you going? Inside. Where are you going? Outside. Feed the pigeons. Oh, uh, it's beautiful out, Isn't it? Ah, spring -- when a young man's fancy turns to love -- 24 hours in a day, and I have to pick now to empty you. Hello. Well, well, I didn't know you were the domestic type. Why, I'm just making some fudge. With pickles? Oh, yes. I always make my fudge with pickles. You should try it sometime. It's really quite different. Ah, I should imagine so. Did you, um, enjoy your golf game? Yes. It was very nice. You seem to be quite an attentive instructor. Ah, that's because Minerva is such an apt pupil. Yes, I know. Uh, you have a method all your own of instructing pupils. Do you always keep your arms around them? Only the girls. Well, of course. I think a person should have more pride than to allow a total stranger to make love to her on a golf course, but then... Oh, well, there weren't many people on the course. I really believe you enjoyed it. Mm. It's not bad. Uh, hmm? You know, you ought to try it yourself sometime. When I want your advice, I'll ask for it. Go on out. Make a fool of yourself. See if I care. Oh, well, if that's the case, perhaps I could take my afternoon off. I have an important engagement. Oh, don't let me keep you. Oh, thank you. Would you like to take some of my fudge to your important engagement? Heavens, no. Hello, Wade. Where are you going? Oh, just gonna take a little ride. Aren't you going to take Jerry with you? What makes you think she'd like to go? Is it worth four bits to you to find out? How about a quarter? All right, but I'm losing money. When Jerry's mad, it's because she wants to cry... and when Jerry wants to cry, it's because she wants something she can't have. Catch on? Well, where are you going with my money?! I never buy secondhand information. Stolen money will never do you any good! Hey, Wade! Wait a minute! Rawlins! - Hello, George. - Hello, sir. Hello, Mr. Bennett. Something I can do for y'all? Where's Jed? He's inside. Mr. Smith? The law is here. Coming! Well, hello, boys. Anything I can do for you? Jed, do you own a roadster, license number 4M802? Yes, sir, I do. Have a pretzel? Have you any idea where the car is now? Well, of course. Why, I loaned it to a fella named Mr. Rawlins several days ago. - Rawlins? - Uh-huh. He's a book writer. Comes up here every year. Ya know he promised to send it back, and I haven't heard from him since. Well, I don't think you'll hear from him again. He went over the bank on the Kingsbury Grade. - Are you sure? - Yep. Oh, he was such a nice lad. Why, they find the body yet? Not yet, but the boys are looking for it now. Oh, gosh. That's awful. Anything I can do to help you out? Yes. We'd like you to drive back with us to identify the car. Well, sure. Sure, sure. Wait till I get my coat. I've got new tires on that car. Did I hear y'all say Mr. Rawlins had an accident? Yep. That's right. My, oh, my. Poor Mr. Rawlins. He was so young-like and nice. He give me these two bucks for luck just before he went away. Hey, George! Yes, sir. I'm coming. There I go, walking in my sleep again. Hey, George! Yes, sir. Yes. Hey, George! I guess I won't sleep. Here I is. Here I is. If you don't stop pounding on that door, you're gonna wake me up, and I'll never go back to sleep. Hey, George, open the door! What's the matter with you? Go away! Go away, man! Please leave! Feet, get going. What are y'all waiting for? George! Man, go away. You know you ain't got no business walking around. Open up, George. I want to see Mr. Smith. I want to get my bag and pay him for his car. Go away, Mr. Rawlins, before I wake up and get real scared. That you, Jerry? Yes, mother. Are you all right, dear? Yeah, I guess so. Night, dad. Listen, young lady, What's the idea of getting home so early and scaring people? I didn't go out. You didn't? What's the matter with you? Sick? Oh, no. I'm -- I'm so interested in this book, I- I couldn't put it down. What are you reading? Um... Well, It's... it's about a... A fella and a girl and... Things happen. You know, it's been a long time since we sat down together like this. Yes, I guess it has, hasn't it? Come on. Tell me. What's troubling you? I don't seem very well able to hide my feelings, do I? Does he feel the same way about you? That's just it -- I don't know. I guess you wouldn't want any advice from me, And I'm not going to give you any. Oh, it isn't that, pop. It's just that... Oh, gee, I don't know. Well, I do. It's only natural for a father to believe that no man is worthy of his daughter, and I'm no different than any other father. Jerry, dear, I want you to be happy, and whatever you do is okay with me. But what you see in that Wade Rawlins, I'll be darned if I know. Pop! I beg your pardon, Miss. I thought I heard somebody prowling around the house. So did I. Must have been us. Yes, Miss. For Mr. Rawlins, I assume. Oh, Grosvenor, let me take it up to him, will you? No! What you see in Mr. Rawlins, I'll never know. You said it. Fix him two, 10-minute eggs. Te-- Why, they'll be hard! You said it. - Morning, Dopey. - Good morning. Good morning, "Get Off the Rug,,. Good morning, "You Too... Bacon and eggs -- Eggs over, bacon crisp! Morning, sis. Morning. My, you don't look good this morning. Nobody asked you. I know. It was my own idea. Who are you dressed up for? The dogs, sweetie. Good morning, Geraldine. - Good morning, pop. - Good morning, Marion. What's the matter with dad? Another hangover? Did you sleep well, Geraldine? Fine, thank you. Good morning, Dopey. Good morning, darlings. - Morning, mommy. - Good morning. Good morning, Jerry, darling. Good morning, Marion. Good morning, Henry. Good morning, Em-- What do you mean, "good morning, Henry"? I was just trying to save mother a good morning. I'm so hungry. Thank you, dear. I haven't had a thing to eat since last night. Morning, everybody. Good morning, Kane. Say, dad, you know, I've been thinking, if I want a car, I ought to go out and work for it. Very good thought, son, but I'll tell you what we'll do. You come into town with me, and we'll pick out one together for your birthday. - Dad, you don't mean it! - Yes. Mother! Mother, did you hear what dad said?! Jerry, Marion, dad's gonna buy me a car! And I'll tell you what I'll do. You can use mine till you get your new one. Aw, gee, Jerry -- Hey, wait a minute. What's wrong with this family today, anyhow? Yes, what's wrong with it? Grosvenor, where -- have you seen anything of my paper? I put it under Mr. Rawlins' door, sir, as you ordered. I wonder if he's through with it. I'll go up and see. Thanks, Geraldine. That's very nice of you. Say, pop, do you notice anything funny about Jerry this morning? No, I hadn't noticed anything. I hadn't, either. I wonder what it could be. I know what it is, but I'm not telling, Unless I get my price -- two bits. Marion, it isn't good manners to keep things from your parents. I know, but it's good business. Geraldine, what's wrong? He's not there. - He's not there? - Not there? Oh, no! - What is it? - What's happened? "Noted novelist dies in mountain crash. "E. Wade Rawlins killed on Kingsbury Grade returning from fishing trip." But he -- he can't be our Rawlins, he's not even here! Noted novelist? And we thought he was just a tramp! Oh! Oh, this is terrible! Oh, Jerry's fainted! Somebody do something! - Jerry! - Jerry! Oh, dear! Somebody do something quickly! Kane, put her on the couch. I'll get some smelling salts. His car went over the Kingsbury Grade. Oh! Poor, poor Rawlins! Oh, it doesn't seem possible! Quick! Quick! The smelling salts! Jerry's fainted! In the closet. There's no smelling salts here. I'll get the ammonia. Ohh! Rosa. Take care of Etta. Why don't you look where you're going?! I'm sorry, pop, but I -- Rosa, come here and open the window! Aaaaah! Will somebody please stay healthy around here long enough for me to get something done?! I'll speak to you later about this! Marion, come on! Let's get some water! W- what's the matter, pop? Oh! Oh! Here, poor pop. Marion, this is no time for games. Can't anybody do anything around here but me?! My goodness, poor Rosa. Oh, dear, dear. Etta, what happened? Oh, I was looking out the window, and I saw... - Ohh! - Etta! Etta! I guess there's nothing I can do here. I'll go help poor Jerry. Oh, hello. Did you hear what happened to... Rawlins! Why, Mrs. Kilbourne! Oh, Mrs. Kilbourne! Why, Mrs. Kilbourne! Please! Come on, sis. Wade. Wade! Uh...uh, don't go away. I'll be right back. Jerry. Jerry, darling. Well, don't stand there like a wooden Indian. Do something. Get some water. Some smelling salts or something. Wait a minute. You can't do this to me. You're dead! Go on, go on. Get some water. Mama! Papa! Dad! Dad! Pop! Pop! Are you all right? This is getting worse than an epidemic! Oh, what hit me? What, Emily, you too? Jerry? Are you awake, Jerry? No? Oh, well. I'll get the water. Ah. We'll get the water. Oh, darling! I knew you loved me! Grosvenor, come here. What's the idea of that getup? After watching the success of all the tramps who've infested this house, I realize that I've been in the wrong racket. From now on, me for the open road.
