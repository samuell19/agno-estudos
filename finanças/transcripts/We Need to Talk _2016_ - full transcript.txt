Do you want a better future? SPAIN, 2006 I can offer a perfect one. 1300 square feet. A gigantic kitchen. A lavish living room and two huge terraces. Isn't it great? Jorge says it's a unique opportunity. The bank is recommending this neighborhood to everyone. It's too out of the way. No, it's going to be well connected. No, I don't want to live so far away. Morn, it's not to live here. You can rent it out -and not just live on the print shop. - I don't see it. A solid argument, it sounds great to me. And don't even worry about the mortgage. Right, honey? We'll cover 100% of the amount. In yen. - Yen are great. - Luis, show my future father-in-law the finishing. Of course, come with me. Jorge, who will rent an apartment in the boondocks? He already said this will be downtown next year. If my parents were alive, I'd have them buy two homes. It's so expensive! The way things are going in Spain, it'll be worth double. Or triple! Don't worry, honey. Spain is blasting off. - Yeah? - Totally. What was the name of this neighborhood again? Sesefia. So it's a serious investment. SPAIN, 2007 Not as serious as me marrying your daughter, but yes. If it weren't, Jorge wouldn't say anything. We have to pay our mortgage, and the one in Sesefia, so we should save that money. Money saved only loses its value. I read the same thing in Expansion the other day. Why risk it? We're doing just fine. Mom, not even today? It's okay, Patricia. If it were a scam, it wouldn't have a Latin name. Thieves don't speak old languages. Mom, write down the name: "Forum Filatélico." No! We were going to rent the apartment in Sesefia and it's still empty. SPAIN, 2008 Morn, Jorge finally found the answer. I can get you the money tomorrow from the bank. All I need is for you to put up the shop as collateral. Jorge, we'd better wait. Yeah, Miguel heard this is a bad time. Look, look. Why is it a bad time? I saw it on the news. That savings bank. "Lehman and Bros." That's the U.S. What has Spain got to do with the U.S.? Jorge says the crisis won't reach here. Of course not. Spain has the most solid bank system in all of Europe. And don't tell anyone this, please. Do you know what the word "crisis" means in Chinese? I don't remember. "Opportunity." And buying two retail spaces in an airport is an opportunity? Notjust any airport. The future Castellén Airport. Okay, Miguel. I know these last few years, for whatever reason, my advice hasn't been very accurate. So you're probably wondering why I called you again. Okay, well... I'm glad you asked. Because you're going to get back all the money you've lost. You don't have the saintly balls to ask for what little we have left. Lucas, can you come over here for a moment? I understand that you doubt me, but Lucas is Branch Assistant Manager of the agency. Hello, Nuria. Nice to meet you, sir. Can I call you Miguel and make this less formal? No. Good. More respectful. Right, let's simplify here. Your savings have been traveling in tourist class, but from now on we're offering the chance for them to travel in pri... - Pri... - Priority class. That's right! Priority shares. The latest gold mine. If this doesn't work, I don't know how your mother will react. It will work. Right, Jorge? Of course it will. And to prove it, I'm putting all my savings there too. And I took out a second mortgage to buy them. I shouldn't say this, but we've hit the jackpot. WE NEED TO TALK 3 YEARS LATER - Good morning, my love. - Morning, gorgeous. Happy anniversary! Happy anniversary? - You didn't remember. - Yes, I did. - What day is today? - Okay, I didn't. What day is today? Oh, okay. I'll play along. You forgot? Nice job, Victor. If you forget our first anniversary, what about after 20 years together? No, stop, Nuria. I actually really forgot. But I can take you breakfast out on the terrace if you want. No. Take out your hand and give me my present. You're such a bad liar! Happy anniversary. Okay. Hold on, this isn't just for our anniversary. How did you know I had something in my hand? How could I forget, Nuria? I've been planning this all month. But you have to help me, because I've never asked anyone to marry me and I'm not sure how to do it. Of course, Victor, but I don't know what to say. I'd like to say yes, but... I'm not sure how to do it. But I just realized I already said yes! But I have to talk to Jorge. In Murcia Capgemini needs 20 graduates specialized in computers, telecommunications, mathematics and physics. And in Madrid, Aspin Consulting requires 7 analysts... Good morning, champ! You look awesome. You look like a million bucks! We need to get your room ready. That's right, the Frenchies get here at 3, staying 2 weeks. Weren't those stale? They go down okay with milk. You're too handsome! Make sure your side is clean. It looks fine. Please, make sure. The last tourists lowered our Air & B rating to 4,4. If we drop to 4,3 we're dead. It was those picky Belgians. Not picky, you put paper towels in the bathroom. I told you, it's too rough. Have we got toilet paper this time? Double-sided. And handy wipes. Let them try and complain. Because with less than a 4,4 nobody rents. Only backpackers. Pull at the same time so it's smooth. I'm serious, George. lfwe drop to 4,3 I'm going back to Albacete. Backpackers, over my dead body. You can't go back to Albacete. Of course I'm not going back. But not because I don't want to. I have to stay here until you're better. My cell phone. See if it's about a job training course! Lucas! Lucas! I'm coming! What's wrong? Nuria. What do we do? I'm not going to answer it, I can't right now. Good, never force it. - Yes, hello? - Good, force it a little bit. Hi, Jorge, it's Nuria. Say "Nuria who?" Be a jerk. Hi, Nuria. How are you? Fine, and you? Fucking awesome. I'm fine, in general, fine. Right. Look, can you meet me this afternoon? I'm very busy actually. What time? How about 5:00 at the kiosk in the Plaza del Rey? At 5:00, perfect, great. Hold on, one thing. VVhy? What do you mean, why? Why what, Jorge? Why do you want to see me? Because... well, we need to talk. Bad news, huh? No. What makes you say that? You call me after two years saying you need to see me and it has to be today. What's up? We'll talk later, okay? I have to go, I have another call. Bye! Everything okay? No, it's not okay. He can smell it coming, I told you. She's going to say she's pregnant or something. VVhy? You heard her, she said "We need to talk." And? That's always bad news. Not always. Give me an example. - I can give you a thousand. - One. - I can give you a thousand. - One. - I can give you a thousand. - Just give me one! How about: "Hi, Jorge. I love you. Let's fuck. We need to talk." There you go. - And what is there to talk about? - What? You already said it all. You love me, let's fuck. That's it. No, that's not it. Look, Jorge. - What about the "how/when"? - The what? You have to talk about it. Time, place, dress code... Then she wouldn't say "We need to talk." She'd say "Let's meet up and have sex." You're a sly one! But wait, I have another example. "Hi, Jorge, I'm the notary." He says your relative died and you don't care because you don't know him and he left you an inheritance of 100,000 euros. "We need to talk." That's a solid example, you have to admit. It's no good either. Why not? Because you said it all. There's nothing to talk about. I see where you're headed. Let me work on it. Look! It's always bad news. And what do I wear? That's important. What to wear? How about a shirt I have that's a salmon color but with stripes? She gave it to me. Perfect. That way you strike a chord the moment she sees you. But it may be hanging out to dry. But I haven't worn it for months. Yeah, but I might have worn it the other night to go out drinking. Damn it, Lucas. You have a thousand shirts. Don't be mad, champ! It matched my outfit! Unbelievable. With all his shirts, he has to take mine... You're fucking kidding! Look, Jorge. Sometimes people say things to you that may seem bad but actually, if you think about it, you realize that it's the best thing that can happen to you. By the way, you look really good! And here I am with great news! You really are on a lucky streak! Why the look? We've been at this for 3 hours. You're overdoing it. I can'tjust wing it! Well, things that seem bad but are actually good... sounds totally prepared. Of course it's prepared! It has to be! Okay, smart guy. What would you say? - What would I say? - Yes. This might sound a little ambiguous, but... how about: "Jorge, it's been two years and it's time to get a divorce." You'd kill him. You just killed him. Very funny. He'd have a heart attack right in front of you. Nuria, please! Who is it? Hi, Nuria. It's Lucas, Jorge's ex-boss. Yeah,hL What's going on? Jorge fell out the window. - What? - Don 't worry, he's okay. The neighbors' clotheslines broke his fall. But he's staying overnight just in case. - Tell me where he is. -l'll give you the address. But don't say things like "We need to talk" which is always bad. - He told you that? - Yeah, he was a wreck. He's touchy about you and you can't say crazy things like that to someone completely on edge. What's wrong, Nuria? Let's try and grow up a little. Jorge tried to kill himself. I'm the one who should be in the hospital. I told you Jorge wasn't well, but you pushed me into it. What matters is it's nothing serious. No, what matters is he jumped out the window! How could I say "We need to talk" to him? Yeah, Nuria. The truth is... we need to talk. Excuse me? Sweetie. Please, you can't feel guilty. No, I feel like the worst person in the world. Surprise! Nuria! - You didn't need to come. - Of course I did. - Lucas told you? - Yeah, but not much. This is just a precaution. I'm actually fine. It's so embarrassing, I was only trying to... We don't need to talk about it. I came to tell you that you can count on me. How are you? Fine. Great, huh? No, not great. I said fine. I'm not fine either. Just so-so. Are you working? Yeah, in an interior design store. But I don't really like it. "Fine" just popped out, it's not like I'm doing great or anything. I'm so-so. But you look great! - Thanks. - You're welcome. What did you want to tell me? It was something bad. No, why do you say that? You said "We need to talk." So what? - That's always bad. - Not always. - It's not? - No. Give me an example. Well... - Go ahead. - I don't know. - Jorge. - Yeah. It's been two years, I want to know how you are, we need to talk. Seriously? Of course. I thought you were pregnant or wanted a divorce. What? How silly! Or your parents are in more trouble... My parents? Why? Because of all the trouble I got them in. No, my parents are doing great. I heard your dad had to sell the print shop. That's true, but it was really good for him. He has a great job now. By the way, they both send you their best, with all their love. I'm sorry. It's just... Okay, okay. I'm still very upset about what happened to your parents. This might sound silly, but... I'd don't know, I'd like to... have dinner with them sometime, or something. Never mind. There's no way they'd want to see me. What? They totally want to see you, Jorge. I refuse to see that schmuck. I don't care if he kills himself. Dad, please, don't talk about him like that. Think before you say things in the heat of the moment. You're right, I'm sorry. I will never see that son of a bitch again! - Excuse me, the Jorge? - The Jorge. Hi, I'm Yoli, I work with your dad and we're friends too. What happened to Jorge? - Apparently he tried to kill himself. - What? Don't worry, unfortunately nothing happened to him. How can you talk like that? You've known him since he was a kid. He was your friend. Yeah, a great friend. I was a small businessman on my way up and now I'm here cleaning other people's shit living at my mother's. The only thing of value I have left is Grandpa's watch. I'm not asking you to forgive him. Just have dinner with him to cheer him up. Forgiving him would also be a relief... I'll never forgive him. It's his fault I lost my two homes, my company and the most important thing of all, my Patricia. And that's what hurts most. Money comes and goes, in my case it hasn't come back, but losing my wife... I can't forget that. Exacflyl This dinner could be the perfect excuse to see her again. Your mother won't want to. Leave that to me, I know how to convince her. You don't have to convince me. I'd love to have dinner with them. Great! Dad said you'd say no. We can spend the weekend at the house by the lake. Oh, wait. We can't. It's not ours anymore. We had to sell it because those two bastards ruined my life. I'd rather jump out the window than go out to dinner with them. We wouldn't go out, we'd have dinner here. So he can see you're both happy here, that you're not broke. But we are broke! That's your view and I respect it. Do you respect mine? No! Look at my life now! It takes me an hour and a half to get downtown! They meant well. They wanted to make more money. They were Jorge's ideas, but your dad got obsessed with getting rich and forgot everything else. So don't trifle with me now, I won't see them. Morn, do you love me? Spare me this nonsense. You love me and you want me to be happy with Victor, right? You don't need that retard's permission to divorce him. No, I can't ask Jorge for a divorce if he's like this because he'll kill himself. And I don't want to build my life on a cadaver. So you both have to help me cheer him up. But I promise you one thing: One dinner together and you'll never see Jorge again. - Swear it. - I swear. - Sayit - What? That I'll never see Jorge the retard again. You'll never see Jorge again. Jorge the retard. - Mom. - Sayit I swear you'll never see Jorge the retard... Say it clearly. I swear you'll never see Jorge the retard again. There. All set. We'll have dinner here. Yeah? I was convinced your morn never wanted to see me again. Don't be silly. Mom thinks the world of you. - She thinks the world of me? - Yeah. She said that? Not literally, but I could read between the lines. And the omelet? Mom makes omelets and potato salad for a bar nearby. That's handy. Since when? That doesn't matter. We have to decorate the apartment, buy a nice ham and wine. I can't afford it. Me neither. That's why we're going to the Corte Inglés. Because we can return things. - You have a card? - Yes. This ham looks great. What kind is it? The 500-euro kind. Then it's a good one. I hope it's not too salty. - It doesn't matter, we can't open it. - No? No. We show him and put it away, just like the champagne, caviar and the rest. What about surimi sticks? They go with everything. Well? Okay, huh? Much better. Wait till your mother sees me dressed like this. She'll love it. Your mom and I really had something. I know. No. You can't even imagine our sex life. - Come on, boys. You okay? - Yes, ma'am. This is the last one. You could have taken cheaper furniture. Exactly. When he sees that chair, he'll think they're loaded. You know he'll try something. No way. You don't know Jorge. But I know you. Anyone would try something. You know what? He can try anything he wants, my love. - Everything looks great. - Yeah, it's not bad. Dad, two things. Your watch should be visible, it's a good one. And please take off your tie, this isn't a wedding. Even sportier. That stuff over there we can't eat, only what's on the table. Got it? - You said it six times. - You got it. You look spectacular, honeybuns. If this gentleman calls me "honeybuns" again, I'm leaving! You can call me anything you want. How about "shit for brains"? Let's see if we can change that tone. Either we all row in the same direction or we go home. He's here. Be super nice to him, like you're ecstatic to see him. - Cheers. - Cheers. To our health, which is what matters most. Yeah, but my parents are doing great all around, aren't you? And we're still madly in love! Yeah, living in Sesefia was a big help. So you moved here? Last year. I was sick of living in town. You can't imagine the peace and quiet here. The air is so pure! The air and everything. Sesefia is a great place to live. I'm glad, because my advice was pretty off... Don't be silly. Want something else? Some ham, one of those cans? I don't know what they are. Caviar or something. Jorge, we're living the high life here. I can see that. I'm fine with the omelet and the potato salad, -but if you want to open something... - No, we're okay. I'm so glad to see you. So are we, aren't we, darling? - Answer if you want. - No, that's okay. Maybe Jorge would like some ham. Morn, he already said he's full. It's acorn-fed, the best around. If you want to slice some, I don't want to be rude. - No, it's not rude. - Jorge, if you gorge yourself you'll get an ulcer. Well, l do want a little ham. Mom, stop. We've been eating cold cuts all week. Your uric acid will skyrocket. No, it won't. Come on, let her slice a little. And we forgot to open the champagne! I won't say no because I love champagne. Watch out, champagne gives you gas. Not if it's good. Go on, open that and I'll cut some ham. Which do you prefer, slices or cubes? Always finely sliced. Then cubes. -L'd better answer it. - Sure. Go ahead, I'll cut you some ham. Don't worry about it. Stop! Morn, what are you doing? This ham cost 500 euros! Tell your father to stop groping me. You're supposed to be a couple! For God's sake, we're supposed to be a couple! You think I enjoy touching you like this? Sit down and leave the ham! What do you want? I'm taking out the Frenchies and I wanted to know how things are going. I hung up on you! That's why I called you back. Are you getting some tonight? That doesn't interest me right now. I doubt it. I'm just planning here. Planning what? The infrastructure. Should I leave you the bedroom? If the Frenchies see me on the sofa, they'll give us a 4,3. I'm not going to try anything. Look, just go after her. To hell with the Frenchies. Backpackers? No problem. Send me a missed call and I'll hit the sofa. You're screwing up! If he tries to kiss you, you can't pull away! Yeah, that was pretty rude. He won't keep his hands off me. Are you that hard up? Me? - Women flock to me. - Mom, you have to give him a kiss or Jorge will realize. I'm not a hooker. One kiss doesn't make you a hooker. Sure! It's not like you're sleeping with him... That wouldn't make her one either. We're talking about helping a human being, for God's sake. You're ridiculous, Miguel. You'll never kiss me again. Patricia, I'm going to tell you one thing. I don't care that you're being like this with me tonight. On our first date, you didn't want to kiss me either, and you even slapped me. So tonight we're doing better. You can keep any comment to yourself. We're not taking shots! I want to take things slowly with her. Why would they have Jégermeister? I have to go, okay? Bye. Patricia. What? Look, don't say anything to Miguel, but actually I thought you two weren't... Well, you might not want to hear this, but it was my fault... Since he didn't want to and I insisted so much on investing... He didn't want to, but he did. No, Patricia. He never wanted to. I'm the one who convinced him. Anyway... I'm just glad you two got through it. Because I can't imagine Miguel without you. He'd die. And I want to tell you that you still make the best Spanish omelet on the planet. Thank you. No, l mean you should do it professionally. You'd make a fortune. Ill--- Good. Jorge, sit in this armchair, you'll be more comfortable. It's velvet made from wild Italian silk in 1960. - My parents bought it last week. - That's right. So things are good at work? He has a great job, yeah. Yeah, I got promoted and I'm an executive now. What company do you work for? Alamo Insurance. Right, your brother was a financial manager there. Yeah, they needed someone trustworthy and they called me. You know, it's one of the top insurance companies. - You work at headquarters? - That's right. Right. Look, I don't want to put you in a tight spot or anything, but do you think there's any chance I could send you my updated resumé? - No problem! - Sendit But one thing, Jorge. Don't get your hopes up, you know how things are in the business world. - Yeah, don't get your hopes up. - How can I not? I want to get my hopes up. Something is starting tonight, I can feel it. Thank you for everything. Okay. I'll open that bottle of champagne. George. Wake up, it's 9:00. How did it go last night? Fine. - Perfect. - I knew it! Did you ask her if she has a boyfriend? Well, it wasn't the right time, but if she had one, she wouldn't ask me over with her parents. Then she doesn't. That's the attitude, George. Let's get moving, we have to make breakfast for the Frenchies. Did you go shopping yesterday? Lucas. The fridge is empty. There are two eggs left. Those eggs must have gone bad. They're not bad, they're good. They're bad, Lucas. - They're not bad. - Yes, they are. No. Yes. No. Lucas. What does this mean? Nothing. Explain this to me, and also the body cream. I don't know what you mean exacfly. I'm starting to have weird thoughts and they're scaring me. Please, let's not lock ourselves into intolerance here. There's nothing wrong with trying new things with your own body during moments of intimacy. Did you jerk off while strangling yourself? - Jorge, please. - Well? Well, yeah. I gave it a try. Last night before bed. It's perfectly healthy. The word "strangle" is healthy? Not said in that tone. How should I say it? Look, George. How can I put this? I was in Berlin. What? In Europe, that's how everybody masturbates now. Standard hand jobs are only still valid in Spain and Portugal. Fine, let's ask him if he strangles himself when he jerks off! I don't know if this gloomy man does. Take it easy, it's no big deal. You're sick, man. You're really sick. No, listen to me. When air stops reaching your brain, you get a huge rush. This is what the elite people do. Politicians, executives, chefs. Chefs? Yeah, the good ones. But watch out, if you go too far... See you later, alligator. And that's not a funny metaphor. I have absolutely no interest in what you're telling me. Besides, just holding your breath would be enough. -It's not the same, George. - Why not? I can't explain the logic, it's just not. What if you cover your nose with your other hand? Nope, I tried it. You need either along scarf or a strap. Yesterday wasn't your first time. You're an expert. Well, an expert... Kind of, yeah. These are the appetizer options. I'll be here if you need me. Thank you. My aunt will have a fit if there's no roast lamb at the wedding. Since you brought it up, are you going to invite Jorge? Of course! He can be the best man. Or play the organ. Are you crazy? So from now on you're not going to stay in contact? No, Victor. The only contact I'm going to have with him will be to ask for the divorce. Last night was just to cheer him up. Look. It's the best man. Answer it. Yeah. Sure. Jorge. Nuria, does your dad use another name at work? I don't know. Why? I came in to bring him my resumé. You can't go in without telling him! I'll just leave it at reception. Fine, leave it and go. They said they don't know who he is. Let's go up and find his secretary. I don't know. Hold on a second. Lucas is there too? Yeah, he says we should find his secretary. No, don't move! Stay where you are. She hung up on me. She said to wait. - Then we wait. - We wait. Dad, you have 5 minutes to get a suit and an office or we're screwed. Don't you filter your thoughts? The rest of us do, but not you. Yours just bubble out. What are you talking about? No. No suit, no office, no way. You saw what happened at dinner the other night. Okay, I promise I'll organize another dinner with Morn. - You sure? - I promise. Miguel. Do you see that what you're asking me to do is impossible? - Miguel... - What, Yoli? If it will help Jorge, I have an idea. Loan you two suits? - It sounds weird, but it's not. - Well, it is a little weird. Of course it's weird. I can't. We'll clean your house. - What? - Yeah. But not like when you do it with your wife on Sunday. I'll take the semi-professional Vaporetto and I'll even polish the tiles in the bathroom. Don't insist, Yoli. He said no, that's it. D0 you guys do rugs too? That depends. Can you open an office for us? Are you putting on a show in front of Miguel here? Call it what you want. But your rugs will be spotless. The only office free is the marketing director's. That office is immense. It's perfect! - You're Jorge? - Yes. Miguel sent me. They told you he wasn't here because he doesn't like visitors when he's closing very important business deals worth incredible sums of money. - Of course. - Should we leave? No, that's not what I said. No need to get upset. Go in. -Inside? - Let's go. Okay, I'll transfer you a million and a half. No, don't worry about the difference, we'll cover that with one of our luxury dinners. Steamed barnacles and elvers and fresh Lambrusco. Okay, take care. Goodbye. How tense. A position like this is pure slavery. Sit down. This is your office? Yeah, why? No reason. You remember Lucas? Of course. How could I forget? How are you, Miguel? Can I call you Miguel? No. Good. So your job has a lot of responsibility. You might say that, yes. What are you, managing director? Not quite. Director of operations? Not exactly. CEO? Maybe. - You don't like to talk about it. - That's right. Wait, George. Maybe he can't. There you go. Go on, call me Miguel. Thanks, Michael. Come in, Yolanda. Sir, you won the Best Executive of the Year Award again. They said you're on top right now. You mean from the Chamber of Commerce? Pretty much, but we'd rather not say. Yolanda, the best prize is doing a good job, so tell them to leave us alone. On your behalf. Are you Jorge? Yes. Yolanda is our Head of Human Personnel Department. An excellent professional. Jorge, you've got a lot going for you. I don't know, but... we in Human Resources have a sixth sense. Right. - Keep your chin up, in general. - Thank you. Jorge. Since you're here, I'd like to talk to you about something. Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee. Excuse us for a moment. - Hello, Yolanda. - Hello. I'm Lucas. You can call me Lucky, it's less formal. Nice to meet you. I have a lot going for me too. Yeah,lnoflced. You can call me Yoli. Look, Yoli. lam always brutally honest with people. Me too. I'm glad. And when I saw you, I thought: When you really want something, the whole universe conspires in your favor. And you know what I want from the universe right now? To have coffee with you some time. You like Paulo Coelho? And many others. Miguel, I wanted to mention something, in all due respect... I'm not stupid. Even if your brother hooked you up... Have you got some kind of a scam going on here? Jorge, please! Then explain to me how you went from your tiny company to that huge office. Look, there's always a little hustling involved. Sure, right. But it's nothing, okay? Nothing. Forget about that, what matters is you're here and last night we had a phenomenal time. That's true. - And you know who really enjoyed it? - Nufla? She did too, but Patricia had the best time of all. Patricia? She seemed a bit tense to me. Not at all. Know what she said to me this morning when she brought me breakfast in bed and gave me a big kiss? No, but tell me. That she'd like the 4 of us to have dinner again. Coffee? Yes. No. Coffee, no. Dinner, anytime. How can I explain this? You see, Patricia never calls people, to not be a bother. So you have to call her and say: "Patricia, I'm dying to have dinner with all of you again." Literally. "Patricia, I'm dying to." Write it down. No need, but will Nuria be okay with it? - Nuria can't wait to see you again. - She said that? Not literally, but I could read between the lines. Why don't we spend the weekend at the house by the lake? Jorge... It's perfect, it's St. John's Eve. You celebrate your anniversary there every year. You still have the house, right? Of course. And Sunday we're going to be there. But I don't know, I think we're rushing things a bit. Okay, you could be right. I'll talk to Patricia and mention dinner to her. That's what you need to do. Now come with me, I have a conference call via On-liner. Miguel. You're looking for an administrative assistant in the accounting department. I forgot, yeah. That's okay. Do you think you can get me an interview? I can try, but I can't promise you anything. You...? Miguel, what are you doing like that? Well, you can see. Your shift isn't over for 4 hours. 4 hours he says! I work 24 hours a day. Wasn't there a lot of shit in the marketing department? We found all kinds of stuff. But it'll be like new when we're done with it. Here, Jacinto. Drink my coffee. I'll see you later, champ. Bye. You treat everybody the same, I love it. That's my secret, closeness. But watch out. - But with respect. - Miguelin! How elegant. Here, for your collection. That damn Pepe. What a funny guy. Yeah. If he said to, call her ipso facto. Your interview is at stake. I don't know how to tell her. Here, let me. I'll write her a Whatsapp. Public relations are my strength. Patricia, right? Patricia, yeah. "What's up, Patty Pussycat?" Don't write that! "Can't wait to have dinner again." Give me that, I'll call her. Let me finish and we'll figure this out. Whatever. What are you writing? "Ha ha ha." Laughter. To make it nicer. "Ha ha ha"? What bullshit. You're right. "Hee hee hee" is better. - What's the difference? - There's a huge difference. "Ha ha ha" is between friends, a joke someone told you. But "Hee hee hee"? Watch out for the connotation. It's nasty! It's for my mother-in-law! - Is she hot? - Give me my cell phone. No, you're right. "Hoo hoo hoo" is better. It's friendlier. "Hey, hey, hey" is too much. - We forgot the emoticon! - No, no. Which do you like? Probably applause. I'm not sending an emoticon. A wink at most. I caught you there. Very sly. What a perv! Wait, how about the Flamenco dancer? You know, like you're saying: "Dinner will be a barrel of laughs." No way! Come on, George. Everyone laughs at the Flamenco dancer. I'm not going to send this, Lucas. You're kidding! You're kidding! - It's okay, it turned out great. - Fuck. When she reads it, she'll call you in 3 seconds. - She's already on line. - Three, two, one. "What's up, Patty Pussycat." Jorge sent that? And there's more, look. I don't know what that is. It's the emoticon of an eggplant. What does that mean? Never mind, Patricia. He doesn't sound very depressed. How do you know? Maybe because he just called your mom "Patty Pussycat." Victor's right, Jorge doesn't seem so bad to me. Tell him about the divorce. But we also have to tell him there's no job interview. It'll be too much for him to handle at once. You said just one dinner. What is this? Is that a Halloween pumpkin? Yes. But it's June. Okay. Fine, whatever you say. I'll talk to him and we'll leave it in God's hands. Look. "Hoo hoo hoo... and hoo." He's laughing, right? Come in, Lucas. George, I'm taking the Frenchies on a cultural visit to get that 4,4. I'm terrified. What happened? We ran out of hot water. And yesterday we had no Wifi. But that's not our fault. Our neighbor changed the password. You're right. What does he care? Has Patty answered? If you mean Patricia, my mother-in-Iaw, no. She's trying to come up with a clever comeback. We're off. - Say goodbye to Jorge. - Goodbye, Jorge. Goodbye! Thank you. You're welcome. Nuria, what a surprise! Hi. - Here to see Jorge? - Yeah, is he home? Yeah, I'll open for you. My uncle and aunt from France. I'm taking them to the wax museum. They're crazy about Jorge, like everyone who knows him. He's in your room. Hey, I'm really glad you're here. Okay. Why are you holding my hand? I don't know, I'll let go right now. BYE. gorgeous. Lucas, wait...! No, no! What are you doing? Take this off! What are you doing? - You should have called first! - No way! I knew it! I knew you were having ideas like this! They said you wouldn't, but I knew it! - Who told you, Lucas? - No, my mother! You talk to her about this stuff? I saw it in your face. This is the last straw! -It's no big deal. - What? - It's the first time. - No, it isn't! With this set-up, it is! But you did it other ways before! Like everyone else. Not like everyone else! What were you thinking, Jorge? Don't say you were thinking about me. Actually I was thinking more in general, okay? Jorge, promise me this is the last time you'll do something like this. Here's what we'll do. Let me get changed and we'll go for a walk. Is this a trick to be alone and go back to what you were doing? Nuria. I might be in bad shape, but I'm not that desperate. Has your father mentioned the job interview? No,notyeL I hope I get lucky. You know how these things are. I know, but just the fact that your dad wants to help me matters more than getting the job. If I get it, even better. You haven't worked since the bank fired you? They didn't fire me. I quit. VVhy? Well, it was the least I could do. You know what? I've thought a lot about back then and I think you were right to leave me. Jorge, please, don't say that. Look, Nuria. When we were going out, I was only focused on having fun, and you can't say we didn't have fun. But when we got married, I started worrying about money, about your security, your parents', and I got lost. And I forgot about what mattered most. About what? "J-X-N-F." "Jorge times Nuria forever." Remember? Of course I do. So cheesy. I liked it. Look, Nuria. I don't want this to sound important... but would you like us to see more of each other? Well, Jorge... I don't know. Let's take things slow. Yeah, take things slow. No, Jorge. If you want, we'll see each other more. But I want you to promise me that before you try what you were doing earlier you'll call me, no matter what time, and we'll figure it out, okay? - Seriously? - Of course. - Really? - Yes. - Okay_ - Okay? Okay. Jorge! What are you doing? What are you doing? How should I know? First you say let's take things slow, then you fire this missile at me. Let's keep things in the middle here. Don't give me whiplash here, okay? I'm asking you, please! Jorge, I'll do anything I can to help you, I swear. Listen to me, both of you. We're doing the job interview. Nuria, don't be ridiculous. I said I caught him trying to hang himself! L know it's only a patch, but we have to stall until he's better. Agreed? - Agreed. - No. Agreed, I'll do it. No, Yoli, no! Miguel, if there's a human life at stake, I'll do anything. What do we do? We only need an office for 15 minutes for the interview. No problem. We'll wax Luismi's car and he'll set it up. Perfect. Tell Jorge you haven't seen anyone so qualified in ages and call him next week. I'll pump up his morale. No, Nuria. I don't want any trouble with your uncle. If you help me, I promise you'll see Mom again. You said the same thing about the suits, and I'm still waiting. And you won't have to wait much longer, because we have to return the furniture. She doesn't want to see me. Maybe, but she hasn't seen anyone else since you separated. ReaHy? Jorge. I'm going to pass you my dad, he wants to tell you something. Yes. Jorge, how are you? Hey, have you got any nicer clothes, like an executive? The dress I wore to my brother-in-law's brother's wedding is beautiful. Nice material. - Hi, guys! - Hi. Come with me. It's pretty empty, huh? We prefer to do interviews at lunchtime -to avoid rumors. - Of course. We don't want rumors. Yolanda's going to do your interview personally as a favor. You'll be great, you'll see. - Not nervous, are you? - A bit. Don't worry. We may be sharks in business, but we don't bite! - Go ahead. - Chin up. I brought my resumé. I'm glad you brought it, Jorge. A resumé says a lot about someone. Cute photo! Thanks. Right. Wow, you're from IrlJn! Yeah. Then you must know Angelin. I moved when I was two. Angelin, his dad had a kiosk. He had a thick eyebrow. No, no. Sure, he must ring a bell. His morn was ugly. Is this a trick question? I'm just saying, this job is very important to me and I think my resumé has a lot to offer. Yes, I'm looking at your resumé. It's very interesting, Jorge. Graduated from Pio Baroja High School, that's great. Economics degree, I see you have email, that gets you points here. I also know middle level English, both spoken and oral. You speak English too? The call, the telephone. - No. - No? No. If it's important, they call back. I'm with you right now. You see? It stopped. Okay, where were we? Look, Yolanda. I don't want to bother you, I can see how busy you are. I know I have no experience in this sector, and judging by the look on your face, you noticed my English is weak. Mainly conversational, because my grammar is perfect. I also know that young people are very qualified nowadays. Kids who haven't spent two years unemployed wondering if they're useful in any way, because you end up feeling pretty useless. No, Jorge. Don't. No, but yes. Let me finish. Look. What I'm trying to say is that I'm the best person you can find for this job. You know why? Because a weak resumé and little experience can be made up for with passion. And especially because I would do absolutely anything for Miguel. No trilingual kid with two Masters can take that from me. I won't bother you anymore. Thanks for listening. You're welcome. It's yours. What? The job is yours. You don't want to see more candidates? And risk another holding coming along and hiring you? Hell, no. Welcome. How did it go? I got the job. Seriously. Did you make a good impression at least? I start next week. 2,500 euros net. You guys must have already known about this. We really didn't. Nuria, please. I thought the interview wasn't normal. Yolanda wasn't a favor, Miguel. You were pulling strings. No, not at all. Look, you don't have to justify yourself. All I can promise is that I won't let you down. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to call Lucas. The poor guy was even more nervous than I was. This is unbelievable! Bye! Bye? Wait! How the fuck could you give him the job? - I screwed up a bit. - A bit? I know, but I had no choice. His interview was superb. You couldn't hire him! I know, I'm not stupid. What was I supposed to do? He gave a speech that blew me away. And he speaks English! The kid speaks English. He could be an upper level executive, no problem. And the 2,500 euros net? No, no. That's not true. I said gross. What do we do now? No fucking idea. What a mess the three of us have made here! Don't you think this is getting a little out of hand? You're pretty sharp! Of course it's getting out of hand. - How about dinner with Dad? - No. You need to put an end to this. For poor Jorge's sake. And everyone's. Oh, now he's "poor Jorge." Last week you wished he were dead and now you feel sorry for him. Didn't you see him gazing at you at dinner? He's hooked. Please, Mom. Talk like an adult. He has a crush on you and now he even thinks he has a job. First of all, a crush is not being in love. And secondly, tomorrow I'm telling him everything. Or I won't. I don't know, we'll see. Good afternoon. Afternoon. We're returning this ham because it's way too salty. How strange, this brand is usually fantastic. -It's the saltiest I ever tasted. - Like salted tuna. I can't exchange it, but I'll talk to the floor manager. Good, because the caviar was awful too. Too watery! If you can't ask him for the divorce, get him to ask you. What? If you want him to move on, he has to stop liking you. I know it's hard because I still have trouble with your father, but the best way to help them is by turning into nasty bitches. So you like this place? I already said so twice, do I have to say it 3 times? Are you aHQTY? No, Jorge, I've just changed. Obviously you don't like me anymore. Don't be ridiculous. Does anybody work here? Sorry. Good evening. Good evening. Look, ceviche. You like that. We'll order ceviche. I used to. Do you still like the same shit or what? Okay, you order the appetizers. I recommend the coconut prawns. Actually I don't like prawns and coconut gives me heartburn. Perfect, prawns with extra coconut. Are you the only waiter? Yes. There aren't any cleaner waiters? Nuria, he's perfectly clean! -L'll order the prawns. - Stop right there! - I want to see the kitchen. - What for? Because if it's like his fingernails, we'll get typhus fever. The kitchen is clean, ma'am. Ecuador clean, or First World clean? That's enough! I'm from Venezuela, ma'am. Apologize to the Venezuelan. Are you calling me a racist? You're behaving like one, yes! Un-fucking-believable! His nails look like a mechanic's and I'm the racist! Come with me in the kitchen. And you wait here. Come on! What's going on? It's okay! I'm so sorry! I'm not being serious! It's hard to explain. Just play along and I'll tip you 50 euros. I'm so sorry. I have nothing against Venezuela. I'm a big fan of the Venezuelan people! I love Evo Morales. I love Shakira! Nufla? Everything okay? No. There's more shit back here than under a cow's tail. - Let's go somewhere else. - No way. I'm not leaving without dinner. Prepare the prawns. Nuria... What crap are you going to give me now? You know that noise make me cringe. Everything I do bothers you! That's not true... What are you doing? I'll spit on the plate, we'll say he did it and we won't have to pay. What are you saying? Nuria! You're right, it's already disgusting. I'll throw the plate in their faces. No... Well? Is this dish good? I don't know! I don't like prawns and coconut gives me heartburn, but... No buts, Jorge. I'm taking it back to the kitchen. No! No. I'll go, l'll go. Okay. But don't chicken out, I know you. Charge me, quick! Mine and that couple's table. Buy them some shots. Tip yourself 50 euros. Okay, 30. - All set. - Well? She apologized and she's bringing another dish. She can shove it up her ass. Listen. I'm going to count to three and we'll make a run for it. - What? - Just run and don't look back. We have to pay! You're all so fucking obsessed with paying! The dish wasn't that bad... Wasn't that bad? If a health inspector came in here, he wouldn't file a complaint. He'd stick a broom up their asses! So I'm taking off. - One... - No! - Two... - No! Come if you want. Three! Run! Nuria, what is this? Shut up! Don't be such a pain! Never again! Run, damn it! In here! Jorge! Yeah, I do this almost every day. It's just... you're crazy. I don't see what's so funny. I do. I love this new facet of yours. No, you don't. How could you like it? - Yes. - No. People say I'm unbearable now. They're wrong. Okay, at dinner you seemed a bit unbearable. - But it's not true. - Yes, it is. Yes, but no. Look, you were brutally honest in there. I think it's awesome. If the food is crap and the waiter is dirty, you say so! I don't care if he's from Bolivia or from Burgos. If I'm being lame, you tell me. We were too formal. Not too formal, we were fucking boring. Always doing and saying what we should. We weren't fucking boring. Yes, we were. But you know what? You're right. You've changed. Now you grab whatever you want. And I like that. This is what I meant in the park. This is what we lost when we got married and I got fixated on money. And I don't know, I think this is the best time to bring something up. Here. What is this? It's a divorce contract. Look, if we're going to see each other, or whatever, I think we should start from zero. Don't look at me like that. It's not crazy. It makes no sense to leave loose ends. Monday at 11 A.M., if you want, we have an appointment with the lawyer. Are you upset? No, I'm fine with it. You sure? I'm sure. I think it's for the best. And you know what I'm thinking? What? I'll count to three and we'll make a run for it. - What? - One... No, stop, stop. Watch out, he looks pretty nasty. We can't leave without paying! Like before, I loved it. It's not like before. It is but it isn't. I'm leaving, come if you want. Three! Jorge! Bastards! I'll kill you! Why are you laughing? I don't know! - He'll kill us! - Over here. Bastards! I can't run anymore! I can't! Nuria, in here, in here. Fucking rich kids! - What are you doing? - Be quiet! Hi. I called you a bunch of times. I lost my cell phone. How did it go? It's done. We're signing the divorce on Monday. ReaHy? - Really? - Yeah. Look, Nuria. Now that it's done, I have to confess. And this will sound silly. But these last days with everything that's happened, I thought you weren't going to tell him. But it's done, right? You asked him. What's wrong? Are you okay? He asked me. Well, it's the same thing, right? What matters is you're getting divorced and you and I are getting married. Of course! Can we change the subject? Yes, but I think it's strange he asked you for the divorce. I said to change the subject. And it's not so strange. Yes, it is. How did he ask you? Where? Here we go again. Let's talk about Dad. You never talk about him. I'm seeing your father for your sake, make no mistake. But he's trying to work it out. Today's our anniversary. Did he remember? No. He never remembered when you were together either. That's true. Okay, we have to meet on Monday to go to the courthouse together. Miguel, it's a divorce, not a baptism. Right. Excuse me. - It's Jorge. - No. - Yes. What should I say? - That I'm not with you. Say no to everything. Why? I thought you finished this last night. - Victor, please. - Jorge, what's up? Where are you guys? I'm here and I don't see you. Where? Today's St. John's Eve, right? You're at the lake? Sure, you said you were coming... We ended up not going. I need to talk to Nuria. She's not answering her phone. Are you with her? No, but tell me and I'll pass it on later. I totally screwed up, Miguel. l haven't slept all night. If you see her, tell her not to worry. Tell her to forget Monday. She'll understand. The lawyer thing. Ilove her... - Sweetie... - I said to hang up. - No, you didn't. - That's true. But I don't care and I don't care what he said. I'm not seeing him until tomorrow at the lawyer, period. But he just said he doesn't want the divorce. You know what? I don't want you to get divorced either. Two weeks ago we were doing great. So forget it. But you get to call my parents and explain why we're not getting married. Victor, darling. Don't be ridiculous. Filter things before you speak like the rest of us. We're one day away from signing, so please, filter. Jorge doesn't want the divorce. Because he thinks he screwed up. If I convince him, we'll sign tomorrow. Yeah? And how are you going to convince him? No, Nuria. - You can't all go right now. - Then what do we do? Tell him the truth! You think if I tell him it's all a lie he'll sign the divorce? We have to keep tricking him until tomorrow. But you're forgetting a small detail. The house at the lake isn't ours anymore. Yeah, because of that fucking schmuck Jorge. Sorry, with the utmost respect. Don't answer it. - Jorge, sorry. - Dad. We got cut off, I was driving my SUV. Nuria just texted me and she wants to go to the lake. We'll all meet there in an hour. Okay, bye. Dad, what are you doing? The house isn't ours anymore! Itwill be. I'll call Ricardo and Luismi, the couple who bought it. We became close friends. - Juan Carlos and Pedro. - Right. They'll let us borrow it. This is madness. Give me your keys so he sees we have a flashy car, you take mine. Trust me, my love. Why will they let you borrow it? I lowered the price 10,000 euros right before signing, remember? They really like me. Wind-up or battery? Wind-up, with a swing. Nuria! Hi. No... How are you? Fine. You guys took a while. We went to buy food. We're going to barbecue tonight and come see the bonfires after. That's great. Hey, I didn't know there was a shortcut to get down here. You know it, right? - Of course. - Sure we do. Nuria, you okay? Yeah. I lost my cell phone last night. Shall we go up to the house for lunch? Since I was here so long, I prepared a surprise for you. Let me give you some advice. Don't get obsessed with Nuria. Sure, that's easy for you to say. But imagine for one second your life without Patricia. You can't, can you? That's me without Nuria. You see what I mean? You'd be a loser. - I wouldn't say a loser. - Yes, Miguel. A total fucking loser. Take it from me, I've been missing her for two years. You don't know what that's like. And you never will. Why did I ask her for a divorce? I want to be with her. So look. Be careful. I don't understand these things, but over 1,000 euros. And it's beautiful, obviously. The money isn't a problem. Since I start working next week, lfinancedit I wanted to give it to her after we sign, but now I don't know. Should I just give it to her? Give it to her today. You sure? Yeah, don't wait. Give it to her today. Hello? - You need some help? - No, it's this one. Haven't come in a while? No, we come as soon as the sun comes out. When you have two homes and two cars, your key ring drives you crazy. All set. I confused it with the key to the jet ski. It's totally different. We wanted to add color. - We went a little overboard. - A little. - Did you decorate this? - Yeah. This is very popular now. Very. You're working on a Sunday? You know, an important job has no schedule. Tell me about it. How about dinner? Chinese food? Okay. I get off at nine and I'll call you when I get home. Nuria. Jorge. I'd like to discuss a few things with you. Want to sit down? - Okay... -l'm coming. Look, Nuria. I want to apologize for last night. You can't just come out and say something like that. - You don't have to apologize. - I think I do. - No. - Yes. - No. - Okay. Look, if what I want is to be with you, why ask for a divorce? And I was thinking... I'll go see who it is. What are you doing here? I got your cell phone back. You could have given it to me tomorrow. Yeah, but you have all these text messages you should read. Like this one from Jorge: "Nuria, you can't run off after kissing me like that." You looked at my phone? I think kissing someone else is much worse. - It was nothing, I can explain. - Go ahead. Please, Victor, not now. What type of kiss? What type? Do you have a catalogue? I said it was nothing! Tongue or no tongue? Those details don't matter right now. That's what I thought. Who stuck out their tongue first? I didn't say there was any tongue. It doesn't say peck, it says kiss. What are you, 15 years old? Please, leave. No. I'm not leaving until you fix this. No tongue exactly how? He didn't open his mouth? Hi. A neighbor came to say hi. Nice to meet you. Jorge. Victor. Okay, bye! Say hi to your wife. Sorry, Nuria. My wife's not answering and I lost my car keys. No problem, we'll take you home and you can fix it tomorrow. Impossible. My house keys are on the same key chain. Fix me a cup of coffee and I'll say hi to your parents. You have no idea how much I miss all of this. If it weren't for Jorge's ideas, we'd still have it. He only wanted to give us a hand. And he did. He choked us. Yeah, but forgiving people is also important. Jorge was very clumsy, but... he loves our daughter very much. And that's what matters most. Where's your watch? José Luis and César weren't such good friends. - Juan Carlos and Pedro. - Right. Mom, Dad! Victor the neighbor came to say hi. Miguel, Patricia. How are you? Great. What a surprise! I lost my car and house keys, so I'm staying for dinner. We were going to see the bonfires later. Great, I love the bonfires. Yoli? Lucky. We need to talk. Please, don't say that to me. I'm sorry, I'm not Head of Human Resources. I studied as a beautician, but the beauty sector is in the toilet. Miguel and Patricia separated, he lives with his mother and he works here as a cleaner with me. And Nuria wants to divorce Jorge so she can marry an awesome guy. God, you scared me! I thought you were going to say you had a boyfriend. What? And right when I was going to give it to her, Victor got here. Victor got here and I couldn't, but I was about to. I'm so sorry, Jorge. I feel really bad. Don't worry about it, it has nothing to do with you. What were you going to give her? A gift. Nuria and I were married. Well, we still are. And we broke up. But I think we'll get back together. Sure, it's typical to have feelings for your ex. - But you know what? - What? It's not true in the end, is it? Well, neither way. What we have isn't typical. Crap. Since you asked my opinion, I'd say move on. I didn't ask your opinion. Exactly. But forget it, it never works out. - Sure it will. Miguel agrees. - What? - Right? - What? Do you agree or not? Agree? Not really. Don't stand there in shock. But you said so before. Maybe I said yes, now I'm saying no. What do you mean? It's either yes or no. Are you guys close friends or what? Very. What did you tell him exactly? I told him... What did I tell him? That he was so determined that maybe yes, maybe no. That's what I said. - If you ask my opinion... - I didn't ask. You said to give it to her today. And I don't care. As soon as I get a chance, I'm going for it. - Here. - Okay. Come on. I have a call. Yoli? Lucas knows everything and he wants to talk to you. - What? - Miguel, can you hear me? I hear you. Answer me one thing: Do you love Jorge as much as I do? If you do, give me the address, I'm on my Way. Nuria, if you can't decide, you'll always have a room in Sesefia. It's actually not a bad place to live. Thanks, Morn, but I'm getting married in two months. - When are you going to tell him? - At dinner. I want us all to be there so you can help me. You know Jorge's not well, I need you to give me a hand. Jorge, this might upset you, but I hope you take it well. I've done some strange things these last few days, it's true. But I did them so you wouldn't be hurt. What I do want you to know is I really love you. And I know this will be hard for you, and I'm sorry, but I met someone. Victor. And I'm going to marry him. Very nice, Nuria. - Lucas, what are you doing here? - I came to cry with my friend. I'm sorry, he pressured me and I told him everything. -L'm already crying on the inside. -lt's okay, Lucky. Don't make this more complicated. You're the one who made this complicated! A little, yes. Jorge had huge hopes for you. And so did I. But don't worry, Jorge and I will be very happy. In Albacete. - Shall we? - Let's go. You don't know Nuria, Victor. I remember one summer... What are you doing here? Yoli? I'm sorry, Jorge. But you and Nuria "need to talk." What's going on? Come on, Nuria. Do it. What? Look, Jorge... Wait a second. Please, sit down. I want to say something. Dad, not now. Yes, Nuria. Please. Yoli, sit next to me. I'm starting to get scared. It'll only be a second. Before you talk to Nuria, I want you to know that I've forgiven you for everything. I'll always be your friend. Now I am scared. It's okay, George. I'm here. And you, Patricia. What can I say that you don't already know? I've never loved anyone like you, honeybuns. And Nuria... Miguel, if you loved me so much, you'd have remembered what day it is. It's easy to remember we got married on St. John's Eve. But always the same, your father always forgets. One moment, Patricia. Miguel. Ithink it's time. Happy anniversary, sweetheart. Thank you! He gave it to me because he was afraid you'd find it. This is very expensive! Yeah, but that's okay. I was going to give it to you later, when we were alone. There's an inscription. What does it say? I'll tell you later. I'm embarrassed in front of all these people. Don't be silly, tell her what is says. You read it, sweetie. "J-X-N-F." What? What did you say? "J-X-N-F." What does that mean? I thought I'd just write that and let people arrive at their own conclusions. Seriously, what does it mean? "Joined by Nuria forever." Right, Miguel? Yeah. I wanted to keep it a mystery, but... Jorge revealed it. Damn, it's beautiful. It's very pretty, Miguel. Yeah. Well, I guess you and I need to talk now. Yeah. If it's about something personal, I'd like to do it in private. If you don't mind. - Please. - No. Shall we? I want you to understand one thing. - We won't leave Jorge alone. - Thanks, Yoli. Don't thank me. Look, I have a gift coupon we can give him. Sushi workshop, salsa dancing classes and a free buffet in a Galician restaurant in Ciudad Lineal. Damn, my three favorite things in the whole world: Sushi, dancing salsa and Ciudad Lineal. Jorge, this may upset you, but I hope you take it well. Or at least that you understand. Do you? You haven't said anything yet. Don't rush me, I'm trying. And I'm nervous, what do you expect? You won't understand and you'll take it all the wrong way. I'll understand, no matter... No, you won't. And let me make it sound worse to make it easier. Nuria, how long have we known each other? Our whole lives. At this point you can tell me anything. Saying those things you're really not helping me. And what you just did with my parents. Why did you have to do something so beautiful? Nuria, just tell me. Jorge, listen to me, because... I'll count to three and we'll make a run for it. What? Run until I say stop, which I never will because I don't know where we're going, but far. - Is this a joke? - One... Do I look like I'm joking? Jorge, run away with me. -L'm not going anywhere. - Two... Your parents... They separated two years ago, so leave them alone. One... Wait, I start work with your dad next week. Does Yoli look like a Head of Human Resources? Let's run away, I'm telling you. On three... Not until you tell me if there's more. We lost this house, I've been seeing Victor for a year, he proposed and I said yes, so do what you want, but I need to get out of here. I'm leaving on the count of three. It's my only way out. - Why did you lie to me? - I didn't lie to you. - Yes, I did. - Yes, you did. You see? I knew you'd take it like that. I was afraid you'd kill yourself. Kill myself? You think I wasn't upset when you jumped out the window? This all got out of hand. So l'm leaving, with or without you. That doesn't mean I don't care. I want you to come with me. I don't know where we'll live or how, but right now I just want to run away with you and not look back. One... I don't like that look in your eye. Two... You don't look like you want this, and it's now or never. I didn't jump out the window. What? It was an accident. I saw you trying to strangle yourself. You got me there. - You see? We need to leave. - Nuria, wait. I can't wait, Jorge. One... No, Nuria, wait. - Wait... - Jorge, please. Two, three! Nuria. I told you there was a shortcut. Okay, Yoli. I need to make a toast. But this isn't really a toast. This is a... Sorry. Are you okay, Luke? I'm about to cry. What do you expect after what Jorge did? It was very nice. But don't fall apart, or I will too. It was more than nice. Nice is for other things. What Jorge did with Nuria is a historic moment for this country. - You think? - Of course! The first ever Spaniard to steal an Argentinian's girlfriend. That's unbelievable. Remind me to upload it to Wikipedia tomorrow. Perfect, because it's a milestone. A Spaniard stealing an Argentinian's girlfriend is as huge as lniesta's goal. What the hell? Even bigger, because Argentinians are love predators. -It's in their genes. - Of course. They've banged half of Spain, damn it. Take it from me, I'm from Albacete and we've got our thing too. You sure do. You've got me hooked. -L'll handle it. - Do that. That's why this isn't a toast, it's something else. I've been waiting for Spain to overcome this crisis for years. If an unemployed Spaniard can steal a girl away from a loaded Argentinian, who's totally hot... - Very hot. - Very handsome. - Very handsome. - Very handsome. This is not a tiny sprout, this is a whole head of lettuce. Your insights are so deep. - To the end of the crisis! - That's right.
