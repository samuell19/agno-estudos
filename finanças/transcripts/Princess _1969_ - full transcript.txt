You'll be famous, and I'll be rich. Spotlights, glamour, fame. CinemaScope, Technicolor and stereophonic sound. Capitalist. Hick. Hey, lady, listen to me. You can... Yes, hello? Lady? Hey, lady, my car. Stop. Hey! Walter? Walter? What are you up to? Walter? No shouting in my courtyard. Mr. Walter, what's this all about? In my courtyard? In my time... Together they came down the stairs, holding hands, like a couple to be married. Mr. Walter, but that's your novel. That guy is crazy. And she nodded timidly... Hand in hand, they come down the stairs. Like a married couple. Princess doesn't even feel... Princess? Turned down again? Dear sir, at this moment we don't see a possibility to publish your work. Great. Dear sir, our programme is full, so we are obligated to send back your manuscript. - Fantastic. - Dear sir, your work doesn't belong to the genre we publish... Extraordinary. - What are you saying? - Great. - Great. Exceptional. - What do you mean? Here you are. Look. What do you think of this? That's incredibly beautiful. Fantastic. Mark, do you know what that novel of mine means? A masterpiece. - That's a masterpiece. - That's all great, but without my idea you'll never sell that story. - Nonsense. - That girl's just exceptionally pretty. - It will be a bestseller. - A bestseller. Come on... It will work, it has to work. Give me the copy. - The copy of your novel. - I never make copies. One types it twofold with a carbon paper in between. Where is it? - Downstairs? - Downstairs. - In the courtyard? - In the courtyard. Idiot. ...sad tears press the princess' shoulders forward. Walter, it's all in there, incredible. - Go tell that to the publishers. - I've read all his books. - Then you're probably the only one. - Because I quit writing. You have to re-write it. - How sad. - He'll be world famous. I've been saying it forever, sir. - There, idiot. Keep it. - As a souvenir? - It's a good book. - it's too good, man. - People... People want sex. - Sex. - Action, they want. - Action. - Violence. - Violence. You have to give the people what they want. I'm going to... we are going to make a picture novel out of your book. A comic? Based on my book? Never. And it will be named: Princess. That's great. And exceptional and fantastic. Yes, we know that. Touch it up a little, mess around a little. And the title... - Princess. - Yes, that will be all, eh? And the action and sex, eh? And what about this? - That's till the same girl. - Yes, but what kind of girl? Your conquests mean nothing to me, I don't care about your girls at all. Yes, but this will. This is Princess. Incredible, but in God's name tell me, where are you going with this? To Venice. Because I've met her there. Listen. Signorita, lady, miss? - I'm Mark. - I know. Me Jane, you Tarzan. I'm a photographer. Can I take a picture? I'm here for the film festival. - You already have. - But I mean a real one this time. Can I... Jane? Margie. - May I? - Go ahead. Thanks. - I'm hungry. How about you? - You'll buy me lunch? - Why not? - It will be spaghetti with your kind of money. You're wrong. It will be ravioli. - And if I don't like it? - You will like it. - Do you always take pictures of girls? - No, I'm specialized in landscapes. - I can imagine, plenty of curves. - Oh, let's not talk about my job. - Why? Don't you like it? - Well there are nicer things. - For instance... - You. It must be fun to be a press photographer. Yes, when you like bread and butter. - Are you a tourist? - I'm here on holiday. - Do you like Venice? - I love it. Why? Have you for that any special reason? I think it's the only city I know that the tourists can't destroy. Are you sure you're a photographer? - Are you going tonight? - Where? - The film festival. - I'm not a star. - You could be one. - Anyway, I haven't been invited. - I... I invite you. - Thank you. I'd like that. Twelve o'clock already? I must go. - You come tonight? - I don't know. - You will. - Perhaps. Hey Cinderella, don't lose your slipper. - Oh Mark, you pinched it. - No, the waiter gave it to me. Liar. Never. Cheers. Oh I love champagne. I propose a toast. From one drink to another. I wish this night would never end. - Let's go to the North Pole and build an igloo. - Too cold. - We could make an open fire. - It will melt. - And hunting bells. - And fish through holes in the ice. - And jingle bells. - You mean sleigh bells. We would have to stay very close together or we would freeze to death. And in 2000 years they'd dig up us as good as new. Oh Margie let's not waste 2000 years. - There, Shakespeare, here we are. - I don't get it at all. This girl, Margie, will be Princess, the main character in the picture novel. - I get... - Your story... Your story will be our blueprint for that photo novel. I still don't get it. Your unpopular, incredible novel will be a goldmine. And that magnificent, fantastic plan, a vulgar photo novel... Not an ordinary one, a photo novel with Margie and action. And sex. - Not too much. Just enough. - But... It all fits. The dark forces tormenting your Princess, that's... - A group of gangsters. - How do you know? - Just an idea, a brilliant idea. - Not an ordinary gang. A gang of gangster girls. I'm seeing it already, the gang of the the naked bosom. Of the bended lily. The routine of daily life your Princess can't compete with, will be an adventure. In your book she gets help from a psychiatrist, - in our photo novel she'll be helped... - By a private detective. No, by me. And that means a load of money. - But money isn't the only thing. - No, there's sex as well. Violence, ask everyone. Everyone. Everyone? Everyone? Sex in the news papers. Sex on TV, violence on the football field, at the race track, on... you'll find sex everywhere. - You'll find violence everywhere as well. - And? - The rest is in your novel. - Nobody's interested in that. - The publishers will fight over it. - The publishers always refused. - Want to bet? - It's a bet. OK. Who parked that car there? Idiots. Look at that. Just got back. - Yes, yes. There. - Morons they are, morons. - A dent. - A what? - A dent. - Yes, but I can't see it. - You wish? - De Ridder, Mr. De Ridder. Do you have an appointment with the president-director-general? I'm sorry, but he's in a meeting. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, Mr. president-director-general. - Yes, sure. - Hello, Maeterlinck speaking. Mark. Photographer. The photographer. You don't have any time? Sir, I have a great idea. We'll be upstairs. Thank you. Are you coming along? Never be intimidated. In a meeting. I'm sorry. That's not done. No, sir, that isn't possible. That's life. I see you managed to get in after all. Well, my time is limited, gentlemen. - Time is money, isn't it? - And we are bringing you money. No words, but facts. What's your proposal? - A photo novel. - A photo novel? I don't have much time. I know, use it well. But this isn't an ordinary photo novel. This one has action, adventure and sex. - Sex? - In color. In color? Yes. No, there's no demand for that. A pretty girl, the main character of the story, will take on a gang, in color. A colored gang? Yes, that's attractive. Sir, that's great. The girl will get into trouble. All the people will be thrilled. Will she make it, or won't she? - And does she make it? - The gang wins. But Princess has a trick up her sleeve. Princess wins after all, Princess always wins. - Who's Princess? - The main character in my novel. - Who, sir? - She's the main character in the photo novel. Princess wins, the masses cheer, and there will be a next episode. A sensational novelty. The weak conquers the strong. - I knew you'd understand. - Yes, but in my novel... the most dangerous situations occur. - Not a problem to Princess. - She can solve everything. I'm picturing it. Sextrasex will be extra sex. - And the sentiment. - No eroticism. - No need to exaggerate. - Make things up before your start. What does she look like? Here you go. Lovely. Exceptional. - There's only one Princess. - There can be only one Princess. - What's her name? - Margie Stafford. - Does she agree? - OK. - Where does she live? - London. Get her. - Now? - Now, tomorrow we'll be too late. It will be a great campaign. Sextra knows no limits. - What are you going to do there? - To get her. - Get her? - Yes, what were you thinking? I don't know. Spend a little money, check out the girls, mini skirts. I can picture you walking around there. I can picture it totally. Listen up, old chap, be careful. - And what if she won't do it after all? - For me? She'll go along. Give it up. All unnecessary expenses. And what will you ask her? - What do you mean, ask? - That won't work at all with my novel. Why are you always being so terribly difficult? - This will be a success. - And the publisher won't do it either. - He promised. - He wanted to get rid of you. - Wait until he has seen her. - She won't come. She'll come. Goodbye. - When will you be back? - No idea. - And what do I have to do? - Write the script. And De Ridder? Keep him interested. - You're a stubborn guy. - It runs in the family. - Idiot. - Walter. - How long will you be staying in England, sir? - One day. - Business or holiday? - Business. - Here you go. - And holiday. - Queensgate Gardens 18. - Very good, sir. - Yes? - Margie? - Yes, love? - I'm looking for Margie Stafford. - ls she in? - Who? Miss Stafford, a pretty girl. Oh yes, the girl that used to live on the third floor. She has moved though. - Where to? - I don't know. I never ask questions. Why do you need her? I thought she was a nice quiet little thing. - Are you a sailor? - But... but Hello? - Good evening, room 8 please. - Good evening sir. There's a message for you. Walter, urgent. Where's the telephone, please? - Over there sir. I'll put you through. - OK thank you, this is the number. Yes. Hello? Ah, Mark. Yes, I was sleeping already. Did I wake you up? The note said 'urgent'. Yes, of course everything is all right. I said she would do it, didn't I? Of course she's here. Hang on Walter. Yes, darling. I'm coming. You can't have me go like this... The girl still has to pack everything. You know what? You ask that geezer to call me. Then I'll explain everything to him myself. Hello? Good night. Hello? Hello? Margie. Nine million people and one Margie. I'll never make it. A call for you, sir. - Margie. - Sir, there's a telephone call for you. Yes, yes. Yes, I'm coming. - Hello? - Hello, mister Maeterlinck? - Just a moment. - Hello? Hello, mister Maeterlinck. Yes, it's the president-director-general. Yes, De Ridder from Sextra. Yes, like I always say: The early bird catches the worm. Yes. What are you saying? Yes, see, I'm in a meeting here. And the Board of Directors would like to know if that Princess of yours is coming or not. Of course she's coming. Yes, she's with me. Yes, yes. Yes, that will do. - No, I need her measurements as well. - 62-48-61. In size? Oh, to get on with. A very nice, sweet, cute, charming girl. Me? Today already? Yes, it has to be done. Yes, yes. Yes, of course. No, it has to be done. Everything's lost. Sabena flight number 604 to Brussels, please check in at gate number 6. BA flight number 266 to Istanbul, please check in at gate number 1. That's her voice. - No, that's not possible. - Could you hold my dog for a minute please? It's her voice. I'm there. The passengers for flight number A336 destination Brussels-Athens-Istanbul - please check in... - Margie. - Mark. What on earth are you doing in London? - I've been looking all over the place to find you... - Mark, I've missed you. - I'm going to take you with me to Brussels. - I can't believe it. - I can... What's going on here? Miss Stafford, you're sacked. - Who's this man? - My boss. Sorry, sir. Miss Stafford isn't sacked. - She's given notice. - Mark, what are you doing? Ladies and gentlemen, London Airport proudly announces that from this moment on flights will be announced in the fascinating voice of the airport manager personally. Bye, sir. Mark? Mark? Are you sure I can do it? Of course, darling. I'll be with you. When I'm Princess, you'll be my prince. Yes, my princess. Everybody's. - OK let's rehearse. - All right. I am happy... to be... - in Belgium... - To be in Belgium. I'm happy to be in Belgium. I'm happy to be in Belgium... - I... - To be in Belgium. Everyone... is very... nice here. Especially... you. - What does that mean? - Nothing. Everyone's very nice here. - Everyone's... - Very. Very nice. I come here... - to work. - I come here to work. - OK. - It's OK? I think... Don't be silly. You're a star now, Princess. Wait. Let's wait until everyone's gone. People like to wait for the princess. I hope they won't keep us waiting too long. I can't stand it. Nerves. And my heart. They do it on purpose. To create excitement. You'll have to be there right from the start or else you'll be at the back and you can't see a thing. A while back I came here to see the king of Norway. Boy, did they make me wait then. And it rained. - And I didn't have an umbrella with me. - She'll be here any moment now. I hope she's sweet and pretty. There she is! Princess, smile. Smile. Princess. Smile, Princess. Smile. - Excuse me. - Where are you going? I'm happy... - I'm happy to be in Belgium. - That's good. A few words for Flemish television? Have you been in Belgium for a long time? - I come here to work. - I'll respond to that. This is Mr. De Ridder from the Sextra publishing company. He'll publish it. - Princess, what are your plans for the future? - I'm happy... And this is Walter, the creator, the script writer, - the inventor of this incredible idea. - We'll publish 50.000 copies. That's not much, but more haste less speed. Next month we hope to double it and we expect much after that. I'm sorry boys, Princess is very tired. Excuse me. She's very tired. Ladies and gentlemen, fairy-tales exist. A princess arrived in our country today. A well-known publishing company from Brussels wants to make a photo novel with her. - Yes, our company... - Our reporters have managed to get an exclusive interview with Princess and in Dutch no less. A few words for Flemish television? - I come here to work. - Very nice. - What's your first impression of Belgium? - I am happy. OK, this is Mr. De Ridder, president-director-general of the Sextra publishing company, who will pay for the whole deal. That's right. And this is Mr. Walter van de Vijver, the creator of this incredible idea. We'll start with 50.000 copies. That's not much, but more haste less speed. We hope to double it. - What are your plans for the future? - I'm happy to be in Belgium. OK, I'm sorry. Princess is very tired. She's very tired, boys. Thank you. The well-known publishing company has taken care of its new acquisition... I thinks she's... Made sure it's acquisition stays at a fitting accommodation. Because Princess will stay at a castle. - Yes, and this gorgeous castle... - And our cineastes have managed to frame a few shots of this castle for you. - Well, I would like to... - Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to present in our studio the man who made this all possible, Mr. De Ridder, president-director-general of the publishing company. That's right, we, I mean the company Sex... You mean the Board of Directors of course. - The Board of Directors of the company? - Yes, the Board of Directors. - Yes, go ahead, speak. - May I? Thank you. Well, that's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are of the opinion that the project has great prospects for the future. What we want to bring you, is a new form of entertainment. We won't participate in the cult of stars. We will however protect Princess against the dangers which threaten her in her new profession. We'll protect her from the curiosity of the public. Princess will stay at a castle, like said before which will be heavily guarded from now on. This way we hope to act in the interest of the community and to contribute to the happiness of this young, but very talented star. Thank you. - Mark? - Yes. - What did the publisher say? - He said you're a hit. - Really? That's wonderful. - OK. - Mark, you're not going. - Sorry, I have to. Stay a bit longer. Just a bit. You look really unbelievably unexpectedly beautiful, but I must go, I have an appointment with the publisher. Mark, I don't have to wear that? No darling, we are just looking. I think it's too sexy. Not bad at all, eh? But, not sexy enough. Not sexy enough. - Walter, maybe you can help us. - I doubt it. - Margie, you like your castle? - You must come and see it some time. Would you mind sitting down, Mr. Van het Water? Van de Vijver. - This has got something, eh? - It's very nice. - Still too much if you ask me. - Yes, too much. - However somewhere very, very... - Dressed. We're not laughing, Mr. Van de Zee. Van de Vijver. - Mark, that's it! - Brilliant. - Mark I can't possibly wear that. - Of course, darling. We can stop now. It doesn't get better than this, eh? - What is he saying? - He doesn't like it either. - This is great, isn't it? - All this is crazy, the whole thing is crazy. - What is she saying? - Fantastic. - Yes, crazy. - Crazy. What are Mr. Van der Plas' thoughts about the dress? Which dress? May I remind you Mr. Van der Plas...? Let's go over the collection one more time and then discuss it. Ma... Mark. - Tell me. - That's it. That's it, man. Maybe a bit too busy, but that's it man. That's it without a doubt. The Board of Directors will be delighted. That's right, gentlemen, we have looked at all possible models and this one's the best by far indeed. It wasn't just the best, it was just fantastic. See for yourselves. Gentlemen... Gentlemen, I'm pleased you approve of my choice. I'm convinced our stocks will rise tremendously because of this new design. Now it's up to the publicity. Action. Action. You've got exactly 15 seconds to free her otherwise you'll explode with the car. Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Yes, more fire. More fire. Yes, pour on some gasoline. What are we shooting exactly? Princess or Joan of Arc? - You take care of the script. - I have a very good idea for that. I have a very good idea for that. To have the next issue printed in blood, real blood. If it's necessary, we will. Harder. Harder. Yes, that's it. You're doing a great job. - Do you really mean that? - Sure. And now the aero plane. - But Mark, I don't know the first thing about flying. - You can do everything. Shoot him. Mark, I can't see you. Where are you? We can see you, Princess. - Mark, I'm tired. - We're almost finished. Go to him. I said, go to him. Please can't we just stop for a moment? - It won't take long now. Once more. - I can't. Kiss him. - Kiss him, kiss him. - Mark. I said: kiss him! OK. Thanks. That's enough for today. See you tomorrow. Walter, where's Mark? - He's gone. - To the publisher's. - He said it was very important. - Walter, I want to go home. YOU... will buy the next episode of "Princess" tomorrow! Hello? Mr. Mark. Princess is just... Of course, Mr. Mark. I'll call Mr. Walter. Mr. Walter. Mr. Walter. - Yes, Miss Angele, what's up? - Mr. Mark's on the phone. I'm coming. Hello? Yes, Mark. Where are the new scripts? Everyone's waiting for them. Listen up. I'm trying, but I don't have any inspiration. Don't act all artistic. Inspiration? Find something, make something explode, create something, write down something, but DO something. Of course. But come by my place so we can go through it calmly. No, I don't have time. I've got heaps of work. This afternoon I can't either. I have to see Princess. Yes, she's getting difficult. She's... grumbling. She thinks I haven't seen her far too long. For the love of God, just make sure you have something ready. Tonight? OK. Hello? How does my princess feel today? Well... It's been such a long time since we've been together. They expect me to be everywhere at the same time. Can't Walter help you? Walter? Come, come. Walter? He makes a poem out of everything. - I must be off soon. - Can't you stay just a little bit longer? - Not tonight love, impossible. - When will I see you? Tomorrow. No, I mean alone. Not at this terrible party with all those people and photographers. The party starts at five o'clock, so we have the whole afternoon together. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. That's nice. - Goodbye, Mark. - See you tomorrow, Princess. - In a meeting. In a meeting. - Yes, I know. I know. That's right, with pleasure I can announce that our new efforts have been successfully rewarded. All copies of Princess have been sold. Next month we'll print an extra 100.000 copies. It's a huge success. All thanks to the ingenuity and dynamic attitude of Mr. Maeterlinck. Gentlemen, I thank you for your confidence. But we haven't reached the end yet, by far! In our production we'll have to strive for even more. Do you understand? Reality. - Even more action. - Action? - Even more adventure. - Adventure? - Even more sex. - Sex? It all has to look even more real. That's why no tricks will be used in the next issue. - That's right. - Gentlemen. From now on we'll really see fear in Princesses eyes. Her tears will be real. - Mr. Maeterlinck, telephone. - I'm in a meeting. - It's Miss Stafford. - Who? - Miss Stafford. - Yes, that's Princess. I'm coming. I hope you'll allow me to excuse myself. Hello, Princess. No. No, I didn't forget our appointment. No, I promised. But... sure. What? See you. - Do you have anything planned for this afternoon? - Yes, I have to write scripts. Leave those scripts be. Can you go to Princess? - But she's expecting you. - I'm very busy here. I still have to do all sorts of things. I have to visit the reception. Photographers, posters, cards... It's crazy... Go to her right away. I can't leave now. And make sure to get on time for a change. Five o'clock, and don't forget to bring Princess along. Five o'clock, Walter. - Mark is at the publisher's? - Yes. He insists on organizing everything himself. I like what you wear. It reminds me... It's different. Margie, why do you wear those sunglasses? You're the only one who calls me Margie. Margie. Let's go and have some fun. - Isn't Princess here yet? - She can be here every moment. - It isn't a new stunt? - We keep stunts for the photo novel only. - How many copies? - We'll start with 200.000 copies. What's keeping Princess? She'll be right here. Excuse me. Mr. De Ridder, you're going to introduce me to that girl, aren't you? Yes, yes of course. I would like that. I told my husband the other day. Will you do it? Sure, you can count on it. Lovely. My husband thinks it's nonsense, but I think it encourages such a girl if one shows a little interest. You know, those girls... I wish you could encourage her. Excuse me. Mr. De Ridder, you know what I wanted to ask you? Mark. - Mark, what's keeping her? - I don't get it... I have to say something to the people, I have to do something. - For the love of God, tell them something. - But what? That she's sick, or dead, I don't care. Tell the people something. Give it your best shot. Go on. Walter. Walter, the party. We forgot all about it. Come on, we can make it. - But... - You see her everywhere. I always dream about it as well. There's she is, her Royal Highness. Mark I'm so sorry, I forgot all about it. Join the party, Your Highness. Ladies and gentlemen, our princess loves you all so much that she forgot all about you. It was a great party, Your Highness. Everybody was here to see you. They waited. Waited. Waited. But you forgot them. And now... they forget you. They forget me, they forget to buy you! Walter. Take her with you. Son of a bitch. Sleep with her. But don't forget, she's mine. I've made her, made her, made her. She's mine, mine, mine. I'm sorry about last night. What do you want? Do I have to go down on my knees? It's all right Mark. I know that you're very tired. OK. OK let's start, we must finish today. Action. Take your spots, as marked. Are you ready? OK, when she comes, you jump in the water. Action. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the sales of Princess are declining. Her time has passed. To us it's important not to go down with her. We have to focus our efforts on the fashion magazines, until we have found something to replace Princess. I propose the Board of Directors will write Mr. Maeterlinck a letter to thank him for his efforts made. We are grateful to him and I suggest we give him an appropriate gift. - A golden watch. - With a chain. Yes, that's right. Mr. Maeterlinck. Mr. director, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a terrible mistake if we would dump Princess so soon already. Especially because I have a few really commercial ideas. Right. Which ideas? Fantastic. Great. Extraordinary. Sextrasex is extra sex We repeat Sextrasex is extra sex What's happening? I think some photographers. - That's what you want? - A bit of advertisement never hurt anyone. What's that chopper doing there? It's not in my script. I don't know either. - Mark. Mark. - Margie. That wasn't planned, right? That wasn't planned? Idiot. So it was planned. Smile, Princess. Action. Maeterlinck, it was fabulous. It was fantastic. - Yes, it was good. - Good? It was fabulous. - Fantastic. Brilliant. - It was a success. A success? A fantastic stunt dear fellow. What publicity. Press attention for a whole week. Next month we'll print 200.000 more. - That's the best issue. - A great achievement. - It can't be topped. - Of course not. This is the summum. I've never seen it before. Great. Fantastic. The sales are going through the roof. It's fantastic here as well. Mr. Van de Vijver is going through the roof as well. - What do you mean? - He's not participating anymore. How's that? He's not participating anymore? What's happening here? Walter? Yes, that's right. And you are determined? You're free to go back to your attic room of course and write a novel nobody wants. Come on, Walter, I'll admit I was wrong. But... it worked and that's the main point, eh? Or isn't it? So you're angry. Are you still going to the press conference with us? I've spoken to the Board of Directors already and we've decided to offer Mr. Van de Vijver a farewell present. - Which is... - A golden watch with a chain. That's right, ladies and gentlemen reporters, we have invited you today to tell you how happy we are. Happy that we were able to save Princess from the criminals, who envy our success, of course. - It was probably the competition? - I didn't say that. By the way, speech is silver, silence is golden. I would like to give the opportunity to speak to my good friend Mr. Maeterlinck, who will... Go ahead, Mr. Maeterlinck. Ladies and gentlemen, I got a phone call stating Princess had been kidnapped and they asked me an insanely high ransom. A well-known figure from the underworld, who faithfully read all our episodes, told me where Princess was being held. We went to that place with a few personal friends and we liberated her, which was extremely difficult. We also thought about the faithful readers, the fans of Princess, and the entire liberation operation has been framed on celluloid. You can read all about it in the next edition of... Princess. - How have you been treated? - Very well of course. After all I'm Mr. Maeterlinck's friend. - What do you mean? - The whole kidnapping was organized by Mr. Maeterlinck and his publisher. - What's she saying? - Princess, could you tell us more? Princess is still upset. This whole situation... Yes, there's something more. From now on I'm Margie Stafford and Princess no longer. It was fun while it lasted. - Princess... - Margie Stafford. What are your plans now? I'm going home. Bye, Mark. Sorry. - Tell us all about it. - Yes, Princess, tell us everything. - What happened? - Why, Princess? Don't push. What is all this? The success went to her head. After everything we've done for her... That's very ungrateful, very ungrateful. And nothing could go wrong for you, eh? It couldn't fail, eh? It was great. Fantastic. Sextra should never have gotten involved with amateurs. - What do you want now? - A golden watch with a chain. - Thank you. But you are... - Miss Stafford. Yes of course. - Thank you. - Please. Margie. Margie. Margie. - Get in. - What? Get in. - Destination? - Airport. I thought so. - We'll never make it. - Fasten seatbelt and... no smoking. BA flight number 252 to London, please check in immediately at gate number 6. This is the final call. Margie. Margie. Margie. Me Tarzan, you Jane?
