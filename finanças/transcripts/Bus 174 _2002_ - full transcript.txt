IN JUNE 12, 2000, THE POLICE SURROUNDED A MAN WHO TRIED TO ROB A BUS. HE TOOK 11 HOSTAGES, AND BOPE (SPECIAL FORCES) WAS CALLED. THE INCIDENT BECAME KNOWN AS THE CASE OF BUS 174. My name is Luciana. It's been 19 years that I live in the streets. Ever since I was 5. The reason why I'm in the streets? Battering. By my stepfathers... and my mother. Before we came to the streets, we had a comfortable life. But Dad was an alcoholic. So Mom would get severely beaten whenever he drank. Then she ran away from home and came to the streets. Hey, may I brag a little? About my happiness? My happiness... I don't think there's any chance I might ever be happy again. I no longer have anybody. I have no mother, no father... I have nothing at all, only my children. There's no way I can be happy anymore. The ground is cold... with no comfort. There's a place, you see? To sleep under the porch. Rich boy up there... lays down in bed, while we're here below, lying on the floor. In the morning, when we rise, at times there's no breakfast... so we go to the bakery's door, to ask for breakfast. Other times, we even steal, because there's nothing to eat. When we grow up, we're already revolted. Mancha was a child when he came to the streets. So he never had the time to find love, from anybody. You get that? The only thing he learned in the streets... was how to survive, man. That's what we all learned: to survive. On our own. Because when we're street kids... if we just sit here and don't go after things... nobody will show up there wanting to give us food... or to help us. No! We have to go after things. I heard the news on the radio... of the administrative car I was in... that BOPE had been deployed in a hostage situation... at Jardim Botanico. I called the unit's commander right away... and placed me at their disposal, to get to the scene first... in order to evaluate in what conditions... things were at that point. He gave me a go... FORMER BOPE OFFICIAL so I left the Rio-Niteroi bridge... and headed to the Jardim Botanico. I was the first to arrive at the scene. TV started showing images filmed... by traffic cameras. The image was of a bus surrounded... at the Jardim Botanico Street, and it seemed that a young man... a robber, was keeping all passengers hostage. REPORTER - "O GLOBO" NEWSPAPER Immediately, the news crew sent... almost all of its team to the spot. "BUS 174" When I arrived there, I introduced myself to the unit's commander... Colonel Soares, who transferred the command of that operation to me... since I was qualified to deal... with hostage takers. I tried, at that point... to gather as much information as I could... in order to brief the troop that would arrive. Following procedures... I started trying to establish contact with him. In order to know his motives... to know how far... to know who we were dealing with. I gave him a name, I told him, "Your name will be Sergio. Is that OK, Sergio?" He answered, "Fine, then. My name's Sergio. You may call me Sergio." Until then, I didn't know, nobody knew he was called Sandro. THE HIJACKER When Sandro was six, his mother was murdered. Her throat was cut in front of him. Inside their shack... in the Rato Molhado slum. VOLUNTARY SOCIAL WORKER The boy watched that. Did he have a father? No, he had no father. Grandpa, Grandma, well, these things don't exist, see? Nobody knows who they are, or who they aren't. So the boy was alone. He had no one to take care of him, he had nothing. So he hit the streets. He went to the Méier district... and he stayed there, where he met other street kids. So a group was formed in the Méier, "Let's go to Copacabana. There's money in Copacabana. That's where the food is." In the South Zone they starve less than in the suburbs. In the suburbs, things are harder to get. We want tourists, people who have change money to spare, and so on. So that's how he started. He left a family drama... and entered a gang of street kids. When I met Sandro, he was this big. It was in the streets of Copacabana. Just like that. We were all sleeping. And when I came to Copacabana's streets... I was this big. "Hey, Sandro, where did you come from?" FORMER STREET KID "Oh, I came from home." "Hey, mate, wouldn't you have some place for me to sleep? I'm feeling cold, and I'm very hungry." Everyone who comes to the streets, starts innocently. Not knowing how to steal. Many don't smoke pot... don't sniff glue. Then what happens? They go to a restaurant, to ask for food, and they hear, "Hey, man! You can't come here often. You have to go after your own food." So they're starving, and they see you getting money. "Come with me, man! Let's grab our money! Come on, let's steal!" And that's how it goes. Their heads turn fast. For many who come here, that's their story. The so-called "street kids"... are boys who have severed all family bonds... with anybody they ever knew from any family they ever had. From any home, any community. They've severed it. They've forgotten their past. They have no past. So their present, their lives... are that street, that corner, that group of friends. The felon, when he realized that police had arrived... he didn't try to escape. He went back to the where he was, taking hostages. That's an interrupted robbery. There are philosophical debates over this. CAPTAIN DISCHARGED FROM BOPE There are police officers who believe that... HAS A MASTER'S IN SOCIOLOGY to allow the felon's escape in that moment... is better for public security. It would avoid hostage situations. Today in Rio de Janeiro, a candidate to the Military Police... is someone who couldn't be inserted in the work market. A person who was unemployed for more than a year and a half... is a person who had no other choice in life... but to become a police officer. It's a job. Poorly armed, poorly trained, with no self-esteem, you know? A police officer who doesn't really know what he's being trained to do. He believes his main mission is to arrest criminals... to kill criminals. The difference between a BOPE officer and a regular policeman... is precisely the former's vocation. He receives... intense training... about the rescue of hostages... combat inside slums... and negotiation of conflicts. He is an elite police officer psychologically... and physically selected to serve in that unit. My assessment was that it would be an incident... BOPE OFFICIAL that would end with the hijacker's surrender... FORBIDDEN TO SPEAK BY THE CORPS just like all the others. After all, the safety conditions of the hijacker... were minimal. He was inside a bus... surrounded by windows on all sides, being watched by every corner. And he had no chance to get out alive... nor to have his demands be accepted. Plus, BOPE had never lost a hostage. Ever. Arriving near the upland area, in Paulo de Frontin Street... GLOBO TV CAMERAMAN the traffic was really bad, when there appeared... a BOPE convoy with sirens on. So we followed it closely with our reporters' car... It was a lucky shot for us. We managed to arrive... very quickly to the scene. Things escalated... so he knew that there were... many people against him, you know? Everyone around the bus... was worried about us, you know? About the hostages. Not about him. So he was alone against everyone else, right? HOSTAGES That was right at the start... when he took the first or second hostage... BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION STUDENT and I heard him say, "Oh, I have four bullets. One for you, the other for you, the other for you... and the last one's for me." I was still ducking, and he didn't know I was... in there yet. So I made many phone calls in hiding... to my home, to my boyfriend... and to my job. It's a little surreal... but I thought it would be over soon, you know? SOCIAL COMMUNICATION STUDENT I was like, "Look, tell so-and-so... that I'm going to be late." See? "Tell her not to worry, because I'm in a robbery." But I still hadn't realized it was a hijacking. That I was a hostage inside a bus. To me, it was just an incident. They caught an armed person, and that person wants to get away... he just wants to leave. I didn't figure that he meant to... keep us inside the bus until he got what he wanted. I didn't think of it that way. Then he grabbed my jacket, to hide his face. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY And he started picking everything inside my purse. He'd grab a towel and wrap it around himself... putting it on his face. But then he stopped, and took me to driver's seat. He sat on it, and made me sit on his lap. He wanted me to drive the bus. He wanted to leave the place by bus. And he'd terrify me, "Tell them I want this and that. Or else I'll kill you. If you don't persuade them, I'll kill you." And he said that he wanted no cameras... no cameramen. He'd shout at the police: "Take that guy out of here!" There was a photographer... right in front of the bus. There was the concern to solve the situation. "O GLOBO" NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPHER To get Sandro out of there, to kill Sandro... and to put an end to all that. That did happen. But there was no securing the area. There were very few police officers controlling the distances. There was nothing to prevent... our access to the scene. The whole time, there were people from the press... trying to get closer and closer... to get better info, better images... that kind of thing. People were there very near the bus. If he were more violent... he'd have killed not only the hostages. Bullets would fly towards everyone there. He'd kill a lot of people. Like in American movies. So he went, "Aren't you telling that guy to scram? I'll shoot him, then. Tell him to get out of there!" My life was at stake there... and the lives of all those people who were there by my side. If he had fired another shot towards the front of the bus... the bullet would have come our way. THE COMMANDER ARRIVES Col. Penteado had been informed... that there was a felon armed with a revolver... its hammer was cocked... his finger was itching on the trigger... and he had already fired a shot. So at that moment there... he assumed command of the operation. So, the cordon that hadn't been well done at first... was improved. We took our stand... in front of Sandro, to the right of the bus. Police officers were placed in Lage Park. So there was actually a siege around the perimeter. Right? The situation was under control. As a commander, he took steps for it to happen: control of the situation. He was out of control. He talked a lot about killing everybody. He told the story of his family being dead... everybody dead, so he had nothing to lose. He was very scary with those stories. He sang devilish songs... that left me very nervous and worried. So, these attitudes led me to believe... that he was very high on drugs. So all I could feel was a lot of fear. I was frightened. I wasn't analyzing him psychologically. That wasn't my intention. I didn't stop to think that his behavior... could be psychotic, or schizophrenic... or that of a drug addict. I didn't consider that... right away. I didn't. Honestly, I really didn't. If he had really been a street kid... and if the police knew this during negotiation... this was a very important fact for the negotiator to know. His personality, as a street kid... would not have developed well... so that would increase Sandro's unpredictability. This Sandro is an example of the invisible kids... who emerge, from time to time, and take over the scene... SOCIOLOGIST, FORMER SECRETARY confronting us with all the violence. OF SECURITY OF THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO It's a desperate scream, an impotent scream. Our incapacity to deal with our dramas... with social exclusion, racism... with all those stigmas, all those problems. We get used to coexisting, with all tranquility... with "Sandros", with tragedies and their offspring... and with the extension of these catastrophes. This has turned into part of our routine. The great battle of these kids is against invisibility. We're no one, nothing, when people don't look at us... don't acknowledge our worth, don't value our existence... don't tell us that we have some quality... don't return us our own image anointed by any light... any life, any recognizance. These kids are starving... of social existence. Starving of recognition. A black, poor boy, any boy... in the big cities of Brazil, he wanders the streets invisibly. There are two ways to produce invisibility: either this kid is invisible because we don't see him... we neglect his presence, we scorn him... or because we cast on him a stigma... a caricature, a prejudice. We only see what we ourselves have projected... the caricature that our prejudices have projected. They see us as criminals, but there are no criminals here. We strive for survival, man. No one wants to destroy anyone else. We don't want to be stealing, so one of these days... we'll be shot and die. We want to survive. Now, we're always being scorned. What we ask for... is that society sees us differently. Because if they see us with the images... that they cast on us... then we're going nowhere. If they open a door, one day... to give us an opportunity, we'll be someone. They take the merchandise that I sell, banana jam... they take it and kick it... "You're a felon! A felon!" So I have to get out in the streets and make a fuss, to say that... that I'm a peddler. I have my merchandise there as proof... that I'm not a felon. It proves that I'm a peddler. But I'm telling what they really do to me. Because it's true. No one gives us a chance, they just stay there... closing doors in our faces. That's how things are right now. If society remains like this... the tendency is that things only get worse. Actually, he didn't show... that he had a purpose. Which led us to believe... that he was a common crook. He simply had been interrupted during a robbery. That's all. And he had nothing to ask for. He had no requests, like, "I want an helicopter." To a certain extent, that was good. We were dealing with someone who had no aims. Obviously, I had an aim. And I'd show him all the time... and others also showed him, that he should deliver the hostages. That's all. ARCHITECTURE STUDENT He said, "Hey! And you, over there?" I had my backpack and purse. "You're a student, aren't you?" I answered, "Yes, I am." "Get out, then. You must be late." And he said, "Go, open the door, and then close it behind you." So I said, "Fine". From the moment he freed a hostage... that strengthened me. From then on, I started to... try and employ the technical measures... to dissuade him from the intent of taking those people hostage. Then he let me go and... that's when he took Janaina and made her... empty the purses. Me and her. He had his hand inside one of the purses and he picked the lipstick. He gave me the lipstick himself, and he told me... "Come here, little girl, use it to write in front of the bus." I don't know what got into me, because I answered... "Oh, I'll write it so everyone can see it out there." I don't know where did I get such presence of mind, something told me: "Write backwards." Because when play, we write... backwards, but with a gun against your head, it's not that simple. His level of violence is directly linked... to the presence of cameras. Yes, he was concerned there with showing himself... and playing his part. HE'LL KILL ALL AT 6 P.M. I had the feeling that... the world would be watching. It would be broadcast. I think that TV made him... feel powerful. Inasmuch as he knew... that he was being filmed, and he wanted to be filmed. He played. He played very well. But he knew what was going to happen if he was caught. So that was also his way of protecting himself. The media is something that gives confidence to the hijacker. Of course. It's his assurance of not being executed, killed. The extension of that situation would also serve as... a space for him to mean something to someone... as a space for him to show that he had power... to show that he existed. That was something as fundamental... as solving the situation and getting out alive. So, in that sense, the TV cameras... mattered to him. Right there, Sandro awakened to us all... in all living rooms. He imposed his visibility. He was the character of another narrative. He somehow redefined the social report... that would always give him the inferior position. Suddenly, it was turned into a narrative... where he was the main character. I wanted to understand why he was there. What was his goal in that. This boy, with this weapon, is able to produce... in us or in anyone else, a certain feeling. The feeling of fear. A negative feeling, but still a feeling. Through which he recovers visibility... he conquests his presence again, he reaffirms his social existence... and his human existence. There's a process there... of self-constitution, an aesthetics of self-invention... that occurs by means of violence, with the gun... in a perverse way. A kind of Faustian pact. By which the boy exchanges his future, his life, his soul... so to speak, for that ephemeral moment... of fleeting glory. The small glory of being recognized... of meaning something, of being able to value his self-esteem. This is the crucial moment... the matrix of everything that's at stake. If we don't understand the depth, the complexity... of this moment, we won't know how to act. HE'S INSANE HE'S INSANE, HE'LL KILL ME Listen up, gang! Just like you're evil... I'm not fooling around, see? I don't care about these cops, brother. I'll be blunt. Things are going to get ugly. You may look at my face and mark my face. This is a real crime. And it's serious, all right. I'll blow her head off at six, if you don't do what I want. I'll have them respect me. Get down. Down. Call my bluff, then. You may film and show it in all Brazil. I'm going to shoot and kill. Well, call my bluff, then. The first to die will be this one. You got it, man? Got it? This is no action movie. This is for real, brother. It's the real thing. Got to impose ourselves, you know? Haven't you shot to kill? Haven't you killed the little brothers at Candelaria? I was there. Wasn't I? At Candelaria, what happened was... there were groups of street kids... who slept in Candelaria's square park... below the porch there, right in front of the church... and Sandro was one of the boys who were part of that group. To me, his name has always been Sandro. "Mancha" was his nickname... because he had a spot on his body. From here... SOCIAL WORKER, FORMER STREET KID to the end there, was where kids arranged their chipboard beds... AND SANDRO'S FRIEND and their bedspreads, and left everything arranged... their beds ready. Here in the middle was where we'd stay in a circle... of friends here, we'd all sit down... and tell stories to each other. We'd go to Bob's and buy their combos... with french fries, soft drinks, sundae... Then we'd take it under there, it was a lot of fun. We'd place all the food on the ground... on top of a chipboard, and we'd open the packages... and the drinks, then everybody got something to eat... One wanted the fries, the other wanted a hamburger... We'd always leave the ice cream to the end... Then finally each one got a spoon of ice cream... and we'd make quite a mess eating there. When we were full... we'd throw food at each other. It was really cool. We felt like family kids. Sandro, as I remember him, used to get sad... and climb the newsstand there. He'd stay on top of it, and we'd ask him... "Are you thinking?" He used to say that he was pondering. So we'd provoke him, "Are you pondering over... who you're going to rob tomorrow? How many are you robbing tomorrow? We used to aggravate him like that. The bed ended here. Many didn't like to sleep here... so they'd sleep somewhere else, less in view. For fear of some coward passing by at night... and throwing stones. In those days, there was a trend of killing... with floor tiles. Those tiles there, near the traffic light. So they'd wait for us to sleep and they'd come late night... and drop a tile on our heads, and our brains would splatter. Happy birthday to you From old friends and new JULY 22, 1993 May good luck go with you And happiness too IT'S THE BIRTHDAY OF ONE OF THE STREET EDUCATORS WHO CATERED FOR CANDELARIA'S CHILDREN The Candelaria group, it started small... and suddenly it was filled with kids from the same area... the Rato Molhado slum, over there. And he'd still remain like he always was... introverted, with the same learning disability... He'd always tell his mother's story, you know? That his mother had been murdered in front of him... something he could never forget, his unknown father. He never knew his father, he didn't know who his father was. So, why did you... What do you think about our life? Maybe it's better in the streets than at home with my family. Where did you live? How was it that you left your home? I lived in Vigario Geral. I left because of a fight with my Dad. Mancha was cool. Just like... FORMER STREET KID I told you how I ended up in the streets... SANDRO'S FRIEND it seems that he went through the same thing. Or maybe he didn't even have a family. Because he never told us whether he had a mother. He'd tell us that he had no family... that he had nothing. So his only means of survival... was living like that. I'm 17, I've been in the streets ever since I was 8. Eight years old. That's where we stay here. I used to stay more in the square over there... but lately I've relocated to here. When we met, I think I was 16... and he was 13. That's how we met, living at the same place... sleeping in the same environment. So we became friends. We'd sniff glue together. Things like that. Mancha, he... he used to steal a lot in the traffic lights, you know? He'd steal from the cars that stopped... and it was always to buy cocaine. He survived. He bought his glue, his food... his clothes, you know? - And to be happy? - A home. A home. A place to live. With food, everything. With a roof. Talk about your life here. Here is... I sleep under there, I shower there... I sniff glue here in this track. I wander about, I see everything that happens around here... I see the police beat us up. - I see it all. - You don't even need to... say that you can see it, because you feel it. What was that about the police? How was that again? They assault us, they beat us up and tell us to move away. - You mean police in uniform? - Yes. Our friend Neilton... was arrested and took quite a beating from the cops. THE NEXT DAY We didn't like that, and we were many. So we went and, there was a sort of rebellion... A demonstration. We fought the policemen. After that, some cops threatened us. They said they'd come back late night and show us. We didn't think it was true. We couldn't believe... there would be a massacre downtown... and a lot of children would be killed. So we stayed. Then, around 11 p.m., almost midnight... two cars stopped by. Since it was a weekend... we thought they'd give us soup. There was a lady who used to stop there, to give us canned soup. We figured it was her. So everybody came quick... to get some soup. We were up on our feet, when a guy came from behind the newsstand... shooting. And all the others got down from their cars... shooting us. So, all I could see was... my friends all lying there, bleeding, dying. Hey, partner, you may film me. Brazil, check this out: I was at Candelaria, the shit is serious... They killed the little brothers there. So... I have nothing else to lose... I'll shoot to kill. Call my bluff. I want it to be recorded just like you're doing there. In Candelaria there were seven victims... and 62 kids left. I've just made a research... on the fate of these kids: 39 have been murdered... part of them are missing, and the other part survives... in precarious conditions. I remember that some radio station had a poll back then... and most people thought that it served them right. That this is how things are, and they really should be killed... all that crowd, to clean up the city. After that, he stayed in different places in the streets. They spread around the whole city. DECEMBER 1993 Many went to work for drug traffic... many were murdered because of this, too. And I didn't see him for a while. Me, Mancha and the guys, we'd sleep... under a bridge, when it was cold... near a theater by Ana Maria Clara St., where there was a play... called "A Bruxinha Que Era Boa" . FORMER STREET KID It was a groups of boys who slept in the Jardim Botanico park. I'd pass by, and they were all laying down. So one day I invited them to come to PUC, the University... to train the Capoeira. So they started to come often to PUC... And they stayed almost two years with me there. In my surroundings, they never stole anything. CAPOEIRA TEACHER And there was a lot of money running around there, see? They were always inside my lab... and they never took anything. DECEMBER 1993 The thing that ruined Mancha the most was glue. I've always told him, "Shit, old buddy! Quit that thing!" and he answered: "Oh, no big deal, that's the only thing I do. So, like, I want to be strong like you are. I want to be fit, and I also play the Capoeira... so I'm going to be fit like you." And I was like, "Let's go, then." So we started to exercise. CHRISTENED "ALEX MANCHA" In the group, he was the most quiet one. And he was the first to just vanish, you get it? It's the glue's fault, man. Just like it damaged him... it still harms many kids... who are in the streets today. Sandro was habitually high on coke. He liked it. He'd steal only to sniff it. Sandro, he didn't care about wearing fancy clothes. His thing was coke. Only coke. There were times when he spent two whole days sniffing it. In order to do what he did, he had to be really stoned. Really stoned. He must have been very high. He must have been without sleep for three nights or something. And he was scared, too. He was scared then. That's what happened to him inside that bus. He was emboldened... because he was under the influence of coke... but at the same time, he was scared. We had been through the tragedy of the Candelaria... and already we were living another tragedy... that was, in a way, an extension of the first one. Sandro, who was a victim of the Candelaria massacre... now had turned into the villain of the new drama. As if it was meant to waken us to the fact... that we need to solve the larger issue. Larger than the Candelaria, larger than the 174... than Vigario Geral, and all of our daily tragedies. It's almost 6 p.m.! So you want to call my bluff? I'll blow her head off! I'll blow her head off! If we add to that the invisibility... the natural drama of adolescence, we'll understand... how difficult was the boy's course in life. Just another Sandro around town. This invisible being. Our society defines these human beings... not as human beings, but as the garbage of society. So they're sent to hellholes, and we wash our hands... with regard to them. PADRE SEVERINO INSTITUTE JOÃO LUÍS ALVES SCHOOL RECLUSION CENTER FOR UNDERAGED LAWBREAKERS "A female citizen was driving her car... when she halted at the red light, and was surrounded... by a group of adolescents... who demanded all her money. Using pen-knives, they threatened to cut her. The felons took her watch and a certain amount of money. The soldier managed to arrest one of the teenagers... called Sandro Rosa do Nascimento, 16 years old. Nothing was recovered in the adolescent's hands." "Sentence: In view of the adolescent's confession... I judge fit to apply on Sandro do Nascimento... the social and educational measure of internship... as a way to offer the young adult more protection... guidance to a profession... identification and reinsertion in the family environment." "State Bureau of Justice and Home Affairs. Social Services/Psychology. Sandro Rosa do Nascimento, aged 16... shows bodily injuries, doesn't live with family. The young adult is in the streets, has stayed in the South Zone... can't remember for how long. Mother deceased for years. Used to live with his maternal aunt, Ju. Didn't know his father. Note: The teenager is very unwilling to give information... about his social conditions. Says he can't remember things... because he has too many problems in his head. Doesn't want to speak about such problems. Chemical dependency ignored. Has used cocaine for two days." "Informative Synthesis. Teenager in his fourth entry here. Hasn't fulfilled previous measures. Lives in the streets with mates ever since his mother died... approximately four years ago. The responsible person has been noticed by telegram... in January 12, 1996. It's his aunt Julieta... though the teenager is not sure about her house's number. After a month's internship, Sandro started... being visited by Mrs. Julieta, who is his maternal aunt... and by his 14 year-old sister, who lives with his aunt and two cousins. This rapprochement with the family nucleus has been very positive... for the young adult, who has displayed changes... in his life expectations. Based on Sandro's reports... one verifies that the loss of family structure... with his mother's murder, witnessed by him... was very traumatic. It made him abandon living together... with his maternal aunt and get involved with street groups... where he started to live and to commit anti-social acts." "Psychological Judgment. Sandro has shown... fully adequate behavior in his situation as intern... following rules, with cooperative and solicitous attitudes. I was devastated. When I arrived there, I cried... and everyone laughed at my face. SANDRO'S MATERNAL AUNT The reason I cried wasn't even... Well, I worried about the other kids in there... what they went through, getting beaten in the hand by their batons. I told them, "People, when these kids are freed... they'll be even worse." With no support, no love... no affection. I think that... the violence, you know? The world is violent, already. Then you put... children in that institution, and mistreat them. They'll get worse. The Padre Severino reformatory, I think it's a deposit... of young human beings, you know? I was his aunt, and I couldn't... bring him here, because he was under state custody. I was locked in Padre Severino twenty times or more. What I learned inside there... was nothing. Nothing. I only learned to become more and more revolted... because inside there, government officials... beat us up. You get that? They didn't teach us anything... but wanted to beat us with chains. And they chained us there. I was interned at Padre Severino when I was thirteen. That was 1994. I was caught during robbery here in Humaita. I was a street kid, I smoked pot... I sniffed glue, I did all those things. Mancha and I were in custody... PROFESSIONAL MUGGER in the Joao Luis Alves School... at the Padre Severino Institute. Several other kids who grew up with him were there. He seemed like a regular kid. Just like the rest of the kids that lived there. Sometimes we were in custody. Sometimes we were on the streets. In and out. That's the way it is. So is life, one day you win, the other day you lose. The staff was bribed... by some of the young inmates. Some of the guys in custody... are drug-dealers... kidnappers, assassins. And they have money outside. I could have lots of money... but I would never show it. Wear a lot of gold on me? What for? So the cops can jump me? When we catch cops, we cut their throats. Cut their throats... pour petrol on them and set them alight. Reduce them to ashes. What? Pity? If they don't give me the money... I set them on fire. Just try me. I turn them into human torches. You shitting me? Remember the job where some friends soaked the old lady in petrol... but got caught? They all grew up with me. About Mancha... I know the thoughts he had. He led a similar life to ours. That bus thing... I don't know why he got on the bus. Maybe he saw someone come out of a bank and get on the bus. Maybe he wanted to rob the bus. If he did, that was stupid. We don't rob buses. We rob rich people. He used to say: "Auntie, when the heat's on in one place... I go someplace else. When it heats up there, I move on." Got it? "Auntie, there's going to be a rebellion. We'll escape." I said: "You won't escape. Stay where you are!" "If I don't escape, when they come back... they'll kill me." So I went and talked to somebody in charge. I told this lady that some kids were going to escape... but Sandro would stay. She said: "I doubt it." But I said: "Sandro won't escape." They can't shoot underage inmates inside, you see? They can't shoot us inside the institution. They really can't. So, we create havoc. As many as 200, 300, 50, 70, 80 have escaped at a time. I escaped once during Carnival, with 400 guys. The school was empty. But in a month, it was crowded again. It always gets packed... so that you'd have two guys sharing a bed. You see? "We inform that the youngster Sandro do Nascimento... escaped on November 1, 1994." What was his demand? 300 dollars? What for? To get back to the slum, buy some new clothes... a few stuff, and that's it? 300 dollars? What for? I'd ask for a hand grenade. "Who in this bus can drive? Nobody?" "Send up a cop who can drive. Any of these cocksuckers." A hand grenade without the pin. "Go. Drive!" I'd like to see him refuse. If he really wanted a grenade... he could buy it in the slum. They aren't expensive. You see? He'd buy it in the slum and go to the city... with a grenade, man. It would have been much easier. No one would shoot him. He'd be holding his grenade. With a grenade in his hands, who would shoot him, then... when the grenade might go off and kill everyone? THE POLICE'S OPTIONS We currently have four tactical options... for the resolution of conflicts with hostages. The first is negotiation. The second is the employment of a non-lethal agent. The third one, to use a sniper, an elite shooter. And the fourth option would be an assault team... that could raid the bus. All these teams must be very synchronized. Actually, they act as a group. Coordinated by a manager. This manager here would be Colonel Penteado. He would have to be at a Crisis Centre nearby... coordinating all those teams. I started noticing the lack of police equipment. The police would use hand signals to communicate. "Behind the car!" The police had no radios, nothing to communicate. They had to use hand signals and mimicry, to communicate... from one side of the bus to the other. What was needed was a communication device... capable of linking the entire police force in a network... enabling the information to reach the decision-maker. That just didn't exist there. Any weaknesses in the police department... of a state or country... will become obvious in a hostage situation. Most of our officers... had not received any training for more than two years. The outcome could not be positive. Unless God wanted otherwise. Geisa was worried about Damiana. Today we know that Damiana had already suffered a stroke. I think she mentioned it to us. Geisa became desperate when she noticed that Damiana... was getting worse. This is my mother. She has to write everything down... because she can't talk... due to the problems she had after the incident. She wrote: DAMIANA'S DAUGHTER "At one point, I couldn't stand the torture any longer. I called Sandro and said: 'Why are you doing this to us? It's not our fault what you are... going through.' He said: 'Lady, I don't want to kill. I just want to get out. But if there's no other way, I'll turn the heat on.' I saw my mother on the bus, her mouth distorted. Geisa was comforting her. That's when Geisa started to shiver, in shock. When she saw my mother's mouth, she panicked. ...and the other one, at six I'll shoot her in the face. Do you think this is some kind of action movie? In a very frail voice, she told Geisa: "I can't stand it anymore." He stuck the gun out of the window. His whole arm out of the window. Then his head too. The elite police outside... and he sticks his head out of the window! Why didn't they shoot him? He stuck his arm out and only had a gun. They could've shot his arm. He wouldn't be able to kill us... if he were unarmed! You can't leave six people at someone's mercy... when you don't know what he might do. They didn't know what he might do. In that situation, a sniper shot... would have been ideal. Of course... this was being broadcast live to the whole country... and the outcome could be that... something like a pound of brain mass... would be splattered all over the bus windows. I wouldn't have liked to watch that. My parents at home wouldn't have liked to watch that. But, technically, that would've been the best thing to do. The right thing to do. When I saw the police in the park... my biggest fear was that someone might take a shot. I believe that if someone had fired at us... he'd have shot me as well. If a sniper's shot had hit him... in the triangular area between his eyes and mouth... the bullet would have hit his nervous system. He'd have been dead in 7 milliseconds. He wouldn't even have blinked. We had men capable of taking this shot. Col. Penteado asked me to take the shot. He asked me if I could take the shot. From where I was, I said I couldn't. My gun was in the holster... and I couldn't shoot him... without him noticing my movements. So he said: "Get over there... and get a volunteer to take the shot." So that's what I am doing here. The guy who's giving the thumbs up... if I'm not mistaken is Captain Ricardo Soares. It's him offering to take the shot. Col. Penteado favoured that option. He wanted the shot to be taken. Some officers told me the governor called. Others said that the chief of police... was in charge of the situation from afar. Only Col. Penteado knows the truth. SEAT OF GOVERNMENT But no one is capable of dealing... OF THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO with such a crisis from a distance. To me it makes no difference who interfered. Whoever it was, he made a mistake. Once he took the first call... probably from the governor, he had to follow orders. He had to carry out his orders: "Spare the kidnapper's life." Any laymen in police tactics could point out... at least ten opportunities for a clear shot. Especially us, who are trained for it. "Sergio, why don't you take us outside... to form a circle around you? With a circle of people, they won't be able to shoot you. Everybody will see. There are cameras." He said: "Lady, you don't know what a criminal's life is like. I can't ask for the support of the gangs. I can't be arrested. If I am, I'll be killed." Then my mother started to talk to Sandro about his life. He said: "Lady, you're silly. You know nothing." She replied: "I do. My brother is in prison." He said: "Look what they did to my back." He showed her what they did to him in prison. She said: "That thing on your back, my brother has it too. My brother is a convict like you. He went through everything you went through. And everything you're going through." Geisa asked him to let her leave... because her mother was feeling sick. She called Damiana "mom". When he said Damiana could leave... Geisa followed her, expecting to leave with her. That is what she wanted to do. "No. She's the only one leaving. You're not going!" Then he said: "Let her go. She's gonna die anyway." I heard it because I was right next to him. This is what happened with Damiana. She gained her freedom by telling him things. She even said she had a child in prison... who was suffering like him. She said she understood him. I remember he said: "If you have a child in jail, then it's OK." And he let her go. "The Department of Justice of Rio de Janeiro accuses... Sandro do Nascimento e Ricardo Vieira. On February 17, 1998, around 1 pm, in Copacabana... the accused began a hold-up. 'I have a '45. Give me all you got! Your wallet, your money! All your belongings!' After the robbery, the police... arrested the accused, taking them to the 12th Precinct... to undergo appropriate formalities. I hereby sentence Sandro do Nascimento... to 3 years, 3 months and 20 days in prison." We are entering one of the worst jails in Rio... FORMER WARDER, 26TH PRECINCT the 26th Precinct: "The Vault." As you can see, there is no natural light. The conditions here aren't very agreeable. It is a bit inhumane, all this darkness. This is it: "The Vault". Closed in. It's kind of sinister. It was for real. The inmates dreaded it. When they found out they were... coming here, they went nuts. As you can see, this cell would hold... at the most 10 inmates in very bad conditions. 10 at the most. But there could be... up to 25 or 30 inmates in here. You know what they did? Half laid down, half stood up. They took shifts. They also did this, see? They hung over one another in hammocks. They kept their toothpaste here. Everything was shared. If I'm not mistaken, this is a communal strap. They all hung over one another. It's very hot, it's a real hell. This is where Sandro stayed. You had approximately 40 people in here. Sandro was well-behaved. Weird, isn't it? People would say that... because he robbed... and he was a street kid... he was a rebellious character. It was quite the opposite. We, who met him here... in prison he always behaved well. Was he a criminal? Sure he was. But here in jail he was well-behaved. He was a peaceful guy. He never gave us any hassle. Never caused any troubled. Although he lived in this... I don't know what to call it. It is no jail. Anyway, this is what they got. Sandro made some friends here. Because in here you had to make friends. If you make enemies inside... you go to sleep and you're a goner. No one ever paid Sandro a visit. Nobody. Not a friend, much less a relative. Nobody. On New Year's Eve 1999... Sandro escaped with some guys. They got the key, broke into our locker... and took my gun and Vitor's. The leader was Odair of Mangueira. Sandro, along with some other guys, just went with the flow. Some cells were open. He was in one of them. He took advantage of that and escaped. When he passed by me, he said: "Sorry, gotta go. This is my chance." So he left. "Urgent. Sandro do Nascimento escaped from the 26th Precinct... on January 1, 1999." One day, he calls me: "Auntie, I'm by the ferries." I said: "Where? In Niteroi or Rio?" "Niteroi." "I escaped with some friends... I'd like you to bring me some trainers. I need you to buy me some trainers... and lend me some money. I'm going to change my life. You'll see. I'm going to change. I'll be famous worldwide." He hugged me, he kissed and thanked me. "Auntie, I'll pay you back." I said: "You don't need to. Sort your life out. Stop living like this. Quit running away." NOVA HOLANDA SLUM He said: "I don't want to live in Boa Vista with the family. I've got a house in Nova Holanda. I'll take you there someday. One of these days, I'll take you to my home." We'd see each other in Nova Holanda... playing video games on the main street of the slum. We'd pick up a girl, go to different places... the Stop Time Hotel... fancy places, you know? We led similar lives. We'd smoke a joint, play soccer... work out, fly kites. Afterwards, he'd go to his house... and I'd go to mine. All in the neighbourhood. In Nova Holanda. He developed a mother and son relationship. In the slum... Sandro started living with this woman. She treated him like a son. ADOPTED AS MOTHER BY SANDRO He told me: "I looked for you... 'cause I think you should be by my side." He told me about his life, what he had been through. "Life is short, mom." That's how he explained it. He'd come in and say: "I can't believe I have a home. I have a bathroom. I have a stove where I can fry chips." He loved chips. Then he'd fold his arms behind his head... and he would stare at the TV. I took the bed out... because he didn't like to sleep on the bed. He liked to sleep on the floor, with the windows open. He would tell me: "This is like a dream. Is this room really mine?" "Of course. It is your bedroom." "Can I have a TV set here, make a little corner here?" "Sure." "If I feel like it, can I lock the door?" "Yes." He'd ask my permission for everything. I really wanted him to feel comfortable. I said: "Son, if you want... when you get a job... even if it's not a regular job... you can build an extension to the house. Build an extension. You could raise your family close to me." He agreed. He had willpower, but something... put him off his track. Maybe it was fear. I'm not sure if he was too shy... or someone threatened him. I don't know. He'd say: "I have to be someone in life. I want to be an artist. I want to do something with my life." "If you try hard enough, you will make it." He'd say: "I want to work. I will talk to Aunt Yvonne." She was his social worker. "I want her to get me a job. I want to study and work." He'd say things like that. I'd say: "If you really want it... you can make it." I was in touch with him two months before... the bus incident. He asked me for a job. He said: "Aunt Yvonne, I'm tired of this life. I'd like to get a job. Who would give me a job? Look at me. I can't read or write. I don't have social security. I've never had a job. What can I do... besides what I do now... who'd give me a chance? Nobody ever did." He said that I'd see him on TV, that he'd be famous. See? I told him: "I really hope so. I want to see you as a big success. I want you to see it too." And he: "You'll see it. Even if I don't see it, you will." THE NEGOTIATION CONTINUES "By six o'clock, I'll kill a hostage." He obviously wanted to get out of there. That's what he wanted. He covered me, and I said: "I can't see a thing." He said: "You don't need to." He said he would count to 100... and then shoot me. He counted "One..." and walked to the back of the bus. "Two..." and he'd walk up to the front. He counted "One, two, three" and then he'd jump to 60. At each jump... I'd start an Our Father, but never finish it. Your life passes before you in flashes... of everything you've experienced... and everything you'd like to do and haven't done. When he made me kneel down... it was clear to me that he was going to kill me. You feel very fragile... because you don't know if you'll live or die. You're controlled by someone who is willing to kill you... who has nothing to lose. At the time... I thought I was simply going to die... and there was nothing I could do about it. "Warn them. Tell them I'm gonna shoot her. Tell them I'm gonna shoot her or you'll suffer." I heard him tell Janaina to lay down. I thought: "My time has come. If I'm gonna die, it's gonna be now." It is a very tricky situation when there are cameras around. Is it tolerable? Is it tolerable in an incident with ten hostages? Yes. It is not nice to hear that. No one likes to hear that. However... casualties are a possibility. We know there may be casualties. Hey, sergeant! I asked for a pistol and a hand grenade, right? Write it down: 300 dollars, two hand grenades... He killed the girl! - Don't you believe it? - He killed the girl! Sandro gave us the opportunity. When the kidnapper starts shooting the hostages... it's time to raid the place. Everyone started screaming. It was nerve-racking. At that moment, I thought the police were going to raid the bus. For the love of God! The criminal would be... shot by the sniper... and the squad would raid the bus... finish him off... and save the hostages' lives. For the love of God! He killed a girl, for Christ's sake! He killed a girl! Hey, Chief, I'm gonna kill another now. Look! We had no idea how bad the hostage was hit. The first one is down, you have to go in... even if it puts the lives of the others at risk. At least some will be saved. We can't wait for him to shoot everybody. That gunshot should have been our cue to move in. But unfortunately... The commander, Col. Penteado... was talking on his mobile all the time... and checking with police chief Marta Rocha... and the local police commander... who I think was from the 2nd Battalion. He knew what he had to do. For some reason, he didn't do it. At that moment, some of us... were positioned and had a clear shot of Sandro. But the colonel didn't authorize it. He wanted Sandro alive. I think deep down he knew... the right thing to do would be to take the shot. There was someone possibly injured... and in need of medical attention. Time could be crucial. But he didn't authorize the shot. He felt paralyzed... by the orders he had received... even if they went against everything that he knew. Where's the rifle and the grenade? Mr. Officer, let's talk. I'm gonna kill another one. If I don't get what I asked for. I'm gonna shoot another one. If I don't get it by six... she dies. The police didn't believe it... they didn't want to believe... that she was really dead. For a while, we weren't sure... if she had been hit. It's almost six now. We have a watch here. She's gonna die now. He's gonna shoot another girl. He's already killed one. He's gonna shoot her soon. You are not the one with a gun to your head. "Keep calm!" Give me a break! Trust you? When there's a girl bleeding on the floor? Is that what you want? Shit! He asked everyone to scream, to shout... to look desperate. Janaina, Geisa and I... we all understood. Everybody cooperated, by screaming and crying... beyond the despair that we really felt. I knew... that nothing had happened, that it was a bluff... because the other women... didn't jump out of the windows. I think that anyone on a bus... going someplace, coming from college... going home, would have jumped. Mr. Officer, one is already down. Another one is going down. There's gonna be lots of blood. Lots of blood. He wasn't going to kill anyone because... it wasn't in his nature. Or else he'd had done if before... in his life, as a street kid... lost in the world, without a thing. He would have killed before if that was in his character. But it wasn't. At the last second... with the gun pointing at my head, he said: "I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna shoot... and I want everybody to scream." It was when I heard someone open a window. I think it was Geisa. I heard everybody screaming, I was screaming too. We were putting on an act. It was an act. When I realised I was alive... I started crying, to get out of my system... everything I had gone through that whole afternoon... in his power. That's when... I realised I was OK, that I was alive. You cry out of joy. You figure it's all over. He wanted people outside to see... how desperate we were... so he could get what he wanted. Parallel conversations were going on. One for the cameras and the people outside... and one for us inside the bus. Deputy... I'm gonna do this one in front of you... for you to see. He was in control of the situation. He could change things any time he liked. Sergio, don't you want a driver? He's on his way. It takes time. - There's no driver here. - Deputy, get over here! - The driver is on his way. - Deputy! Deputy, for the love of God! Deputy, get over here! Get over here! You're scared, aren't you? You're scared, aren't you? You fucked with me and now you're scared! He's making his last moves... but he doesn't have it in him to kill... an innocent person, a person... who has nothing to do with his personal war. You draw up his psychological profile. He wants to get out of there, he doesn't want to be... arrested again, to go through... all that horror again. When you're arrested, they take you to the police station. They beat you up really bad when you get there. If you try anything, it's even worse. If you try to argue, it's worse. They knock the shit out of us. They do what they have to. JAIL OF A REGULAR PRECINCT IN RIO DE JANEIRO, 2002 Where there's room for five, they place 11, 12. There's room for three, but we're eleven. Hey, lay there for the film. Just lay there... Look at how we sleep. The whole day here without walking, then look how we sleep. We were at the 31st Precinct. They brought us here beating us up on the way. They kicked our butts. It's very crowded in here. There's no place to sleep. We're already sleeping on cold rock. They treat our families badly. They give us rotten food. We're constantly hassled. I have leprosy. There's no medical assistance. People are fucked over, some are in here illegally... when they should be back with their families. There's no room in the prisons... There is, if you pay them off. We'll probably be beaten up after you leave. They beat us up. These are subhuman conditions. I've been in jail for over a year. Neither my family in Paraguay... nor the consulate knows about it. They should be informed... because I was wrongly accused. The situation in Brazil is really bad. And the prisoner's situation is the worst of all. How can a prisoner be rehabilitated? How do they expect this country to be less violent? Treating prisoners the way they do? They're not gonna feel good when they leave jail. They'll probably mug and kill more and more. Take me, for example. I'm in jail... after I've done my time. And I'm still in custody. This is crazy! Nothing works in this country. They only care about the elections. Reality is really sad. What you see ain't a third of it. The things we go through here... what we have to go through here, it's really like hell. We would be better off dead than in here. That is the truth. It's better to be dead... than to be in jail. This ain't gonna do any good... He'll kill the girl now. When they've been arrested before, they are more violent. It's harder to make them surrender because they know what jail is like... and they don't want to go back. Hey, this is because you're not getting it. This is because you're trying to be a hero. You're trying to be a smart-ass... During the whole time, it looked like he was angrier with Geisa. She lied to Sandro. She told him a lie... that she had a brother in prison. Sandro found out... it was a lie. This must have caused... the opposite effect of the Stockholm Syndrome. He lost trust in her. It seemed that if anyone had to die... it would be Geisa. On the bus she said... that Damiana was her mother. I read Damiana's diaries... and found out that she told him... her brother had been in prison... or was still in prison. Something like that. Five... Aren't you gonna give me the gun, Deputy? He asked: "Where is your brother being held?" Geisa didn't know what to say. In fact, she knew everything about my uncle's life. But my uncle never stayed in one prison for long. He'd often be transferred to different jails. After he entered the system, he never stayed anywhere for long. That's why Geisa didn't know how to answer. I was sitting down the whole time during the incident. Then he grabbed me and yelled to the cops: "Look how pretty this one is! If you don't like the other one, look at her." He showed me off at the window for everyone to see. He stayed with me at the back window... pointing the gun at my forehead for everyone to see. He told us to cry. He told us... to make things seem more dramatic... than they really were. There was a conversation going on inside the bus... but he didn't want people to notice. I didn't really believe that he would shoot me. But, eventually, I actually started to believe it. The fine line between pretence and reality... was broken. And I believed he would kill me right there. Then I leaned against him... and took hold of his arm. I asked him not to kill me. When I realised he might kill me, I begged. He got annoyed and said: "Shut up or I'll really kill you!" So I looked at him and said: "Well, don't you want me to pretend?" Then he looked at me and I think he realised... that there was... some ambiguity in what he was doing. Either he wanted us to put on an act... or he really wanted to kill us. And then it seemed to me... that he felt bad about it. He felt bad about the fact that I was asking him to comfort me... he who was willing to kill me... or pretending he would. I didn't know if he was pretending... or not... but even if he was pretending... an unexpected move... could make the gun go off. So even if it wasn't his intention to shoot me... it could happen. Geisa was very scared. She couldn't even stand up. Then she sat down and I said: "Geisa, he won't kill you. He won't kill you." She said: "He's gonna kill me!" I said: "He won't." But she was still petrified. I made her lean her head on my shoulder... and hugged her. I was trying to soothe her. She seemed to calm down a little. I told them that they should... make an effort to get closer to him. "Be his friend, you have to be his friend." I think the girl with the glasses understood it. It seemed that she was doing stuff... to create a bond... between her and him, which was what we wanted. Since we weren't really making contact with him... we made sure... that the hostages did. I spoke to her, I talked to her... and told her this: "You have to be calm. You have to make him feel that everything is fine." At one stage when things were calmer... I said to him: "You must really like... your sister. What's she like?" "She has long hair, a little shorter than yours." So I was trying to establish a friendly atmosphere as if... as if we weren't there. As if that conversation was taking place elsewhere. Without all that tension. I was trying to... take his mind off the situation... the feeling of being trapped. I was trying to show that I cared about him... in some way, not only because I was scared... of what he might do to me... but as a human being. I don't know what led him to do that... to be who he was. Now I think: "He was... 21 or 22 years old, the same age I am now." At the time I was 19. He had lived as long as I have. What could have been happening inside his head? What happened in his life... that led him to do that... to be the person he was? CLARISSE - MOM JULIETA - AUNT BOA VISTA NEIGHBOURHOOD "'O Fluminense' newspaper... March 27, 1988. The tragedy shocked the residents of Boa Vista. Clarice was five months pregnant. She was a cheerful, good-natured woman... much admired by her customers... and loved by children. The victim left a trail of blood from the counter to the street. She fell out of the door... and dragged herself onto the street screaming for help that never came." I can only imagine what it was like... for Sandro to see those three guys... attacking his mother, stabbing her. I think he stayed by her side... during the whole ordeal. He saw the knife in my sister's back. I'm sure he did. My sister... came rolling from the kitchen to the bar. She fell onto her back... it pushed the knife in deeper. He saw it all. He only called me... after she was already lying on the floor. He said: "Auntie, come and help Mom. She's hurt, Auntie." "Incident report. The body was found on the street... in front of the victim's shop. A kitchen knife with a wooden handle... was in the victim's back, at the right shoulder. The baby stirred in her belly. I thought she was alive because the baby was moving a lot. Her belly moved. Maybe it was the lack of oxygen. I don't know. The baby moved... so I asked people to take her to a doctor. But she was dead. Her heart had stopped. We were talking as if we were... regular friends, you know? Then Gloria, who was near us... asked me, at that moment to put around his neck... a chain with an image of the Virgin Mary. Then I asked him: "Do you believe in the Virgin Mary?" That was the saint in the pendant. "No, I only believe in God." Then, I asked him: "Do you know... who's the greatest victim in this bus? Of this incident?" He stopped and stared at the floor thinking about it. Then, I said: "You." So he... he thought about that. It was as if he had just grasped the situation. I said: "Sandro, do you want to come to mom's funeral?" He took a while to answer. He went to pee and came back. I said: "Do you want to say goodbye to mommy... before she goes to Heaven?" "Auntie, I'm gonna play marbles." Like nothing had happened. "No, Auntie. I'm staying. I'm flying a kite." He had many excuses. "I'm flying a kite." He hadn't forgotten what had happened. He wanted to stay as far away as he could... from that neighbourhood. He wanted to be far from the place... where he saw everything happen. He would make a decision... then he'd change his mind, decide he didn't want... to exchange the hostages. He just wanted to stay there. He said... he didn't trust the cops. He said he knew they would kill him. If he didn't watch out... they'd kill him. "I'm gonna die anyway. I've got nothing to lose." When I got home that night... my mom said that Sandro... had run away, she hadn't seen him all day. He went onto the streets and we never saw him again. Whatever the outcome... the hostages' chances of getting out of there unharmed... were far greater than his. Dead or in jail, he was going to be worse off. I'm against what he did with that bus. I'm against what the police did too. It's all violence, right? Nothing can justify what happened. But he wasn't going to kill anyone in that bus. He was incapable of it. He never killed anyone, he never would. You see, he threatened them... but he wasn't going to kill anyone. I had in mind that he just wanted to escape... that he didn't want to hurt anybody. I had this thought. No fooling around! Move back! Son of a bitch! Then there was such a mess... that I didn't know whether he or the police had fired a shot. Who had fired? We couldn't know. I heard him say: "Let's go for a walk." I felt all the emotion... the relief that it was all over. I didn't know what was going to happen. That there was going to be shooting. I said: "Geisa, he is not going to kill you. He isn't! She said: "He'll kill me! He will! I insisted: "He won't." If he'd wanted to kill anyone, he'd have done it in the beginning. I remember Geisa crying... and Sandro pointing a gun to her head. When he decided to take Geisa outside... "Let's go for a walk." Nobody was talking to him by then. Not even the cops. He simply made up his mind. I was talking on the phone when I suddenly realised... that he was leaving the bus. Sandro leaving the bus... wasn't good for the police. Quite the opposite. A static situation... should never be allowed to become mobile. If he had walked down the street with Geisa... he could have been lynched... or he could have taken more hostages. We didn't expect him to leave the bus. We thought it was very unlikely, with all those guns around him. We thought he had realised... that any attempt to escape... would put his life in danger. At that time, there were a dozen photographers... kneeling in front of me. When he got off the bus holding a terrified woman... he thought he could use her despair... to convince us to let him go away. He wanted to get out onto the street with her... run away and try to escape. He was holding onto the girl, but he just wanted to get out. Negotiate with the police? What? He was out of his mind. He said he'd kill anyone who got in his way... that he wanted to get away. What could those heavily armed cops do? Where would Sandro go? Would they shoot him? Would there be crossfire with many victims? He was going to give himself in. There were lots of cameras. He'd come out alive. He thought: "Who would kill me on TV?" No one. What was that policeman thinking? Sandro had his back turned, so he took advantage. But the machine gun's bolt wasn't armed. He charged against Sandro... He knew that if he released the bolt... Sandro would spot him. When he was about a foot... from Sandro's head, he released the bolt. Unfortunately, Sandro spotted him. He had a hostage... a gun with three bullets, and Marcelo charging him... with a gun pointed to his face. What would be the normal reaction? He should have used the hostage as shield and fired at his attacker. Even though he knew... that the other cops could kill him. If someone tried to shoot him... his finger was on the trigger. He'd kill Geisa anyway. That movement of his head was enough... to make Marcelo miss both shots. At that moment, people realised... how unprepared we were. All the things we asked for... equipment, training... courses... It fell to the ground at that moment. What did Marcelo do? He did what he was taught. He took the initiative. Unfortunately, that day we were going to lose. He missed by an inch. Personally, I think that the moment... was perfect for the action. Only, he missed the shot. They're supposed to be trained to deal with these things. We all make mistakes. But these are human lives. It's serious. Very serious. The cop came firing at him and he shot the girl. If he'd shot the police and got away... I'd have applauded him. If he'd killed two or three cops... and got away... all his friends would have applauded him. But he took the weaker option. It was the most chaotic moment... because I thought Marcelo had shot him. So I tried to grab him... to pull him towards me. Why? Because I thought his fingers spasms... could pull the trigger and kill Geisa. So I jumped on him... thinking he was dead, or almost dead. But to my surprise, he wasn't dead. I pulled him up and he was alive. I leaned over him and Geisa to try... to get his gun in case he fired more shots. He had fired once as they were... falling and twice more when they were on the ground. When I got hold of him, he shot her. Only one cop acted at that moment... when Sandro fell to the floor and started shooting at Geisa. He was the only officer... who tried to take the gun from Sandro... and save the hostage's life. He's the only one who deserves any credit: Captain Batista. I knew she had been hit when I saw her. From the look in her eyes, I knew a vital organ had been hit. Son of a bitch! I only had time to take the camera off the tripod... and run. Crowds came from everywhere... to lynch Sandro. They wanted revenge. They wanted to take a little piece of Sandro home... as a souvenir. I knew that if I ran... no policeman would try to stop me. And then I... I saw her being carried by a firefighter... to the car, the ambulance... Then I saw it... the blood stains. Her eyes were turned up, she was dead. I'll never forget it. I thought that she wasn't going to die. It was like I had lied to her. Because I had told her that she wouldn't die. They went at him to kill. The crowd was pushing the police and yelling: "Kill him! Kill him!" The guy died in front of everyone. Thousands of people watched it. The whole of Brazil saw him die. The police thought that Sandro had been hit. The blood on Sandro's head... made them believe he was hit. Could this have led the police to execute him? Yes, it could. I wouldn't bet against it. You'll die in jail! Son of a bitch! The officers told me that Sandro was extremely agitated... He was struggling... he shattered the police car's windscreen with his feet. He even... bit the police officers... he broke an officer's arm. They say that's why they had to suffocate him, to make him faint. As for Sandro's death, I have no opinion on the matter. I don't intend to discuss it. The crowd wanted to see a show. At the end of the show, the bad guy dies. That's common in our society. The police killed him by asphyxiation. They suffocated him. Who in that situation wouldn't kill that hijacker? As well as being a cop... a policeman is a human being, who is there watching... They too have feelings of hatred and frustration... that they repress... just like other people, who are powerless to act. But policemen do have power. That's normal for them, cowardice. Cowardice is what they're good at. Just think of it. They caught him alive and killed him. You see? They love that. If they could, they'd kill everybody they arrested. But when there's people watching... they can't. The police killed Sandro's friends... in Candelaria. Now, they'd finished the job. This story comes full circle. The police do the dirty work that society doesn't want to see... but that the public hopes will get done... in some dark corner. Society wants to get rid of all Sandros. We want all Sandros to vanish. We don't want to face reality. We cannot bear it. His invisibility was restored... by the police force. Invisibility is perfectly achieved through death. They killed him because they're used to killing. They know they won't be punished... because who stands up for the Sandros? Who? Who will stand up for the Sandros? No one. I think I have forgiven Sandro... for what happened. But I know that's easy to say... because he isn't here, for me to say it to his face: "I forgive you." Can I forgive him? Yes. I can forgive him... for what he did to us, but I cannot forgive him for having shot Geisa. I can't forgive him for that. Geisa was 20 years old. She had her whole life ahead of her. We were living our simple lives... the way we always did. We were quiet in our corner, happy... making plans. And it all ended in a pool of blood. Today we leave our homes... uncertain if we'll be back. They left home to run some errands. And she died on the way. She died on the way. I really wanted to go there. I really wanted to bury my nephew. But what would happen if I said I was Sandro's aunt? They would come after me at my house, at my work... There would be lots of reporters. I didn't want that. I dressed him in a white shirt. And I told him: "This is not what you wanted. Your dream was to work and raise a family. But you took the wrong path. This isn't what I wanted for you. But Jesus will forgive you. God bless you. Rest in peace." THE FIRST SHOT SLIGHTLY INJURED GEISA'S FACE. THE SECOND SHOT MISSED THE TARGET. THE TWO SHOTS THAT KILLED GEISA WERE FIRED BY SANDRO.
