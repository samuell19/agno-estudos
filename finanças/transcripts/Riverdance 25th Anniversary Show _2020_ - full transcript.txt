I was invited to a new show at the Point Theater in Dublin. And it turned out to be one of the most memorable nights I've ever spent in a theater. The force of the music, the primal power of the dancing, the beautiful symmetry of so many bodies in motion. I think anybody who was in the audience that night realized that they were watching something unique and original. The show of course was Riverdance. Well I suppose Riverdance the show and then there was Riverdance at the Eurovision. So 25 years ago we already had Riverdance at the Eurovision which happened in 1994 as a six minute, 40 second piece that surprised people. Ladies and gentlemen, Riverdance. The interval act in Eurovision is normally something of cultural value from that country. They're normally quite boring. But when Riverdance came on the stage, it was an electrifying moment. The audience are on their feet. And the audience as one jumped to their feet and for like a sustained four or five minutes applause. That in my experience of the business was unique. At that moment I suppose we knew that Irish dance was never going to be the same again. And that maybe Irish culture was never going to be the same again. When we had the initial set of tidal wave response, that was the time that we all thought, well, Riverdance has really had an effect. We have the number one record. We should make a show. Bill Whelan, John McGolgan and myself put our heads together around the table. And we really worked out what the shape, form, concept of the tour piece was gonna be. I think actually, you know Maria will bring something to it not only just with her talent of her dancing but also just her personality. She has that kind of warmth, which you know in a company context is very important. The theme was immigration and the theme was multicultural and the theme was changing, interchanging ideas and being able to work with each other. So all of the dancers didn't just sit in their own saddle. They interacted with each other and the choregraphy was mixed up with each other. One year later, we had a full show in the same venue. Please welcome Riverdance. What we're doing is telling a lot of good will, a lot of high energy and we love what we're doing. The best thing about our show is that all of us would do it for nothing, without any audience there. And I think when you have a show like that, it'll live for a while. It exploded. We just dragged on, held on by our knuckles to the coattails of Riverdance and traveled with it. So straight from there we went to Hammersmith which was a 6,000 seater in London and we played Hammersmith for a record number of weeks. Then we went off and started our American tours in Radio City Music Hall and we held the record there for the longest run of any single show. These dance forms were cultural dance forms that were used to express through history life and death and celebration, and challenge. It's a river of emotions. Pathos, sorrow, joy, it brings us great joy. It brings the audience great joy. So bringing all of that into a Broadway stroke mainstream entertainment stage is I think what caused the real excitement. This was the show that announced to the world that Ireland was a cultural force to be reckoned with in the popular sense. It made Irish dancing sexy and it made it cool. Irish dance, or as they call it, the Riverdance, is now recognized all over the world as a genuine artform and employs thousands of people. I think we are so blessed, 25 years later to be able to experiment with this and to produce this new show. My hope and desire is now that with this new treatment, the show will be reinvigorated, attractive to people who have never seen it. Younger people who weren't born when it started, and even more attractive to people who have seen it before, they'll also be blown away. So it's the next generation. It's Riverdance, the next generation. Hear my cry in my hungering search for you Taste my breath on the wind See the sky as it mirrors my colors Hints and whispers begin Out of the dark, we came. Out of the night. The first of many mornings in this new place. When the sun rolled back the mist, we rose like a strong wave on land. Now we were the people of this place. What burns through the rain and mist? What banishes dark? What makes the children straight and bright? What makes the mountains sharp? The sun is our lord and father. Bright face at the gate of day. Lifting our hearts we sing his praise, dance in his healing rays. Where the river foams and surges to the sea Silver figures rise to find me Wise and as daring Following the heart's cry I am that deep pool I am that dark spring Warm with a mystery I may reveal to you In time Time holds the heart's key Key to everything is Love Love makes the heart flower Flower into a deep desire Passion in the heart's fire Passion and desire See the eagle rise above the open plain Golden in the morning air Weaving and soaring Watchful and protecting I am your shelter I will enfold you Warm with a mystery I may reveal to you In time Time holds the heart's key Key to everything is Love Love makes the heart flower Flower into a deep desire Passion in the heart's fire Passion and desire C? Chulainn is dead. Our great C? Chulainn. He was the sun of morning. He was a fire at night. He was a powerful story. He was lightning in forest. A sudden storm, a short life. Thunder and lightning batter the rocks. The winds howl and great storms break on the forest. Scatter the herds like grain. Fire leaps from dark to dark, fear and anger leap to meet it. We will not go down. We will not be beaten down like grain. Hear my cry in my hungering search for you Taste my breath on the wind See the sky as it mirrors my colors Hints and whispers begin I am living to nourish you, cherish you I am pulsing the blood in your veins Feel the magic and power surrender to life Every finger is touching, searching Until your secrets come out In the dance as it endlessly circles I linger close to your mouth I am living to nourish you, cherish you I am pulsing the blood in your veins Feel the magic and power surrender to life No life is forever. We found and fought here. We loved and died here. We have seen smoke of war climb from our fields of grain. A stain over the sun. The crops wither. The bones of hunger walked the sunken roads in the black reign of ruin. Whole generations lift now to depart. The land has failed us. The dark soldiers appear against us. In dance and song we gift and mourn our children. They carry us over the ocean in dance and song. Now I will soon depart With an aching heart To a land that's far from here There I will hope and yearn For a safe return To the home I hold so dear Lift the wings that carry me away from here and Fill the sail that breaks the line to home But when I'm miles and miles apart from you I'm beside you when I think of you And I'm with you as I dream of you And this song will bring me near to you Dawn, and the ships are leaving. The lovers' grief is lifting on the tide. And hearts too young for sorrow torn asunder, the cruel oceans deep and dark and wide. Tall and straight, my mother taught me. This is how we dance. Tall and straight, my father taught me. This is how we dance. Battling feet on the city street, in pools of light on street corners, the proud, bright, carnival of the poor. Over the rooftops the music calling. The air familiar but not our own. Like something out of a storybook. Somebody dancing, the memory of snow. Cry of an infant, heartbeat of the world. Storm against ship, heartbeat of the world. Heel against floor and wave upon shore. Heartbeat of the world. Sigh of a lover, heartbeat of the world. Cry of a mother, heartbeat of the world. Oh, unstopped heartbeat of the world. Into the river the tide be the stream There fell a tear, a single tear The loveliest of all tears The loveliest of all Tears A passage of tears have gone here unheard A passage of tears have gone here unheard And she will still go on dancing And she will still go on dancing And her muddied name was Mississippi, Mississippi, Anna Livia Mississippi, Mississippi, Anna Livia Riversippi, Riversippi, Anna Livia Riverlippi, Riverlippi, Anna Livia Mississippi, Mississippi, Anna Livia Mississippi, Mississippi, Anna Livia Riversippi, Riversippi, Anna Livia Riverlippi, Riverlippi, Anna Livia Crimson Olivia shimmer in Brooklyn Four hundred person takes some chance Is she in the shaman or the shiek in Colorado When the avalanche pours Tell me who's she gonna send Hooting and pouring and flooding and flushing And hooting and pouring and flooding and flushing Riversippi, Riversippi, Anna Livia, Anna Livia Riversippi, Riversippi, Anna Livia, Anna Livia Shimmer on the river run Anna Livia And after all, the moon over city and forest is everywhere the same. In the old land it silvers fields of grain just as it does here. The rivers everywhere run down to the sea and the land everywhere takes life from the river. It is all a journey. From one land to the next, from one life to another. A generation later, that emigrant's child stands for the first time on the old land. Memory rich in song, the heart come home.
