[goose honking] Chrissie, be reasonable will ya? [goose honking] Chrissie? Look, Dixie, you know my tart, if I leave them at home, she won't look after them. She won't feed them. They'll starve to death. Hey? Stroke me ferret. Suffering, Christ. [Loggo whistles] Where do ya think Middlesborough is, Loggo? The other side of Widnes? [Loggo] Y'all right, George? I thought you were still on the sick? [George] Nah, I'm sound now. [Dixie] Are you listening to me, Loggo? We're supposed to be on the site for midday and there's that soft sod Yosser to pick up yet. [baby crying] [car horn honking] Come on, come on, Son. Come on, hush now, hush now. Come on. [Yosser] I can't. You what? I can't come. [Dixie] What'd you mean, you can't come? What I said Dixie, I can't come are your deaf or daft? Well what the sodding hell's -wrong with ya? -Oh easy, easy. Why can't you come, Yoss? She's not back from the casino yet. Casino. Two packs of playing cards, a toy roulette wheel and he calls it a casino. -It's a knockin' shop. -[pigeon cooing] Nothing more, nothing less. A knockin' shop? Whereabouts is it? [goose honking] You're buggering the job up for the lot of us, you know that, don't ya? [Yosser] What d'ya expect me to do? Take the kids with me? Well, he's taking his goose and his soddin' pigeons. And me ferret. It's not my fault, you know. [Dixie] Well what's keeping her? I don't know, and do you have to tell the whole street? Wanna sort her out, you do really. [goose honking] -You can shut that up as well. -[goose honking] [Chrissie laughs] She's here, Yosser! Hey, Yosser, she's here, she's here, Yosser! And who are you, the town crier? Bitch! Bitch. At this time and in front of the lads as well. Oh yeah, you're only bothered about that, aren't ya? Well the boys are waiting for ya, Jimmy. Aren't you going out to play today? But I'm not scared of you anymore. Am I? [children crying] What have you sorted out about the kids? Who's coming over? [Maureen] Well Pauline's coming. Have a nice time! Come on, good boy. [Dixie] Look, I'm only telling you what McKenna said. That's all you ever do, Dixie. What's it like up there? Hey don't take it out on me, you know. [Yosser] Take what out on you? Nothin'. Keep it at nothin', ey? [Dixie] Anyway if you're not happy, I'll phone him. After breakfast, I'll tell him. And I'll phone The Union Ey no we don't want The Union in our job. Ey, there's McKenna talking there, can you hear him, ey? [Yosser] Ever thought of being a ventriloquist dummy, Dixie? Oh you know the way we work, in and out, fast, throw it down, get out. Union would spoil that, wouldn't it. And money for McKenna. Hey, Chrissie, have you seen this? Pigeon post [laughs] I don't think that's very funny. Sod the pigeons, I'll tell you something now, there's gonna be trouble over this. From what I've seen it's you and the boys, Dixie, it's you who's made McKenna what he is today. So how about a bit of breakfast then? -It's time, yeah? -Yeah. I mean what have any of us got out of laying the roads? Ey? Bugger all except passports and bad backs. Another fiver a day, that's what we want. Pick a fine bloody time and place to tell us, don't ya? Cause bleeding you wouldn't go in Friday night, innit? All right! All right, all right I'll phone him. Right? He won't be in work yet. He won't even be out of bed yet! I'll get him at home now. Well you better have the number, 'cause it's not in the book. I looked once you know. I was gonna give him an early morning phone call. Let him know what it's like to be up at five o'clock. He's ex-directory. [Loggo] Ex-directory. Ex-directory? An ex-lorry driver with breath like a postman's sock, and look at him now. [phone ringing] What? Friggin' hell, Dixie, do you know what time it is? Yeah? Yeah? Well how much? All right, who's stirring it? Oh aye? [yawning] Oh sod it, give it to him. What's a fiver? Look, Dixie, this job's important, I want it done proper. But when they get back, he's out the window good style. Yeah. Well, don't worry I'm glad you phoned. I'll be able to watch The Open University now. What's wrong with you, Loggo? Gut's off? God help us in that van then. Nah, I'm on a diet. I wanna stay slim, youthful and desirable for as long as I can. That's right innit love? You know what I mean, don't ya? Look, do you have any Hermesetas? No, only tea or coffee. What's an Hermesetas, Loggo? Don't you know? It's a love potion, Kev. Afro something or other. African anyway, gets you going, like. I mean three Hermesetas in your tea, your anybody's. [pop music playing in the background] Hey, I've never seen them with -cellophane on before. -[Together] Oh, god. Yeah, not a bad idea though, is it? Least it keeps it clean in your pocket and it don't slide off the plate. [Dixie] You're a robbing sod, Loggo. Talking of robbing sods, what did McKenna have to say? Hey, but it's all cold, look. And it's bleedin' mouldy, look at that! That's because it's a display, you silly git. Hey? What? Oh yeah, no sweat, another fiver for you's. Oh that's sound then, isn't it? Means a double bonus. No it isn't, means we should've asked for 10. Where's me soddin' -bacon gone? -Ah but Chris- Well, we'll know next time. Oh, we don't wanna push it though, Yoss, I mean we're on a good enough screw now as it is. It'll be even better when the job's unionised. You can't stop you, can ya? You never know when to leave well enough alone. Sometimes I think you like causing trouble, d'ya know? You just see where it'll get ya. Look, dickhead. I've been around. I know the score. I just haven't greased the same boss for the last 10 years. I've been down South, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, The Shetlands. Hey what's it like? -The Shetlands, I fancy that. -It's cold and full of ponies. Listen, Dixie, I've been around. Yeah, I know, Yosser. You've been everywhere, you're going nowhere. Ah sit down will ya. D'ya like hospital food, Dixie? Look, Yosser, you're a good mate and all that and I'm not being funny but if the rest of the week is gonna be anything like the last half hour, you might as well go home now. What, me? I'm doing this for us, you know. [Chrissie] Yeah, but we don't like trouble in this gang, Yoss. You know what your trouble is, Chrissie? You're too nice. I'm not joking. It's almost enough to hate you for. [Loggo] Ah leave it out, Yosser, will ya. What's the matter with you? [Yosser] I'm only trying to make this job better, that's all. Hey, Dad? [Dixie] What? Is Leeds anywhere near Middlesbrough? No, but we go past it. [Kevin] Can we give her a lift then? [Dixie] Who? [Yosser] Sod that, bloody student, let her walk. Sitting down all day reading books, getting a fat arse, do her good to walk! She hasn't got a fat arse though, Yosser. [Yosser] She will have, mark my words. I won't be a minute, lads. Ey up, George is trying to cop off. Go on you randy bugger, -get in there! -[laughing and jeering] Come on lads, let's get going. Come on. [belching and vomiting] George? George? [belching and vomiting] [Kevin strums guitar and whistles] You all right? Yeah. I thought you were being sick? Who me? No. Wasn't that you in the toilet? No I went to the shop to get some ciggies. Didn't see you in there, George. I know where he's been. Out on the approach to that student tart. All right there girl, where ya going? Hey room in that sleeping bag for an old tarmac man? You can't keep anything secret from you fellas, can ya? Hey? [Yosser] Hey, here ya are, Chrissie, pull off when you -get a bit past her. -You what, you said- No, no just do it, go on. Right, now when she gets to the back of the van, shoot off. [laughing] Oh Chrissie! Oh, you can't do that, that's sly. [Yosser] Bloody Sir Lancelot. Are you really offering me a lift? No, love, I'm just admiring the view. Leeds? Please. Well get in the back then. She'll be out by the Warrington turn off, just you watch. Been raped lately love? Not for ages. [all laughing] Next paragraph. You can be assured of an excellent job being done at all times. At a most competitive price. Yours sincerely et cetera et cetera. All right then Doris, when you've done that you can come in the office and do me a nice cup of tea. You know who I admire? The Arabs. Do you know why? Cause the women know their place over there, they do. I know, I've seen 'em in Saudi. Hidden away with veils over their faces. But you know what they do? They await a man's pleasure. That's what they do. Hey, can you imagine it though, boys? Hey? Hareems of them? Awaiting! Hey, when I'm rich, that's what I'm going to have. Something like that, on the outskirts of town. A hareem on the hill. Hey, hey, Maureen come over here and try this veil on for size. You know your trouble, ey? Tarts like you? You don't know your position in life. Now, I mean, there's some things you're good at like er making the tea and having babies. But you don't need an education like you're getting to change nappies and cook chips. I've got a brother just like you at home. Oh, aye, good looking is he? No, scared. You what? Who's scared? You are, its obvious. The more insecure anyone is, the louder they shout. Just like our kid.

Ah, a comedian, a Liverpool comedian. Does your mom know you're out, son? There was a gang of Liverpool lads up here last year, they didn't do a good job. You tryin' to say something, pal? No, just telling you, for your information. So, Hitler was a pillock but Franz Beckenbauer's a good footballer, for your information. Oh, aye, one of them. Just what we need. [loud machinery chugging] Your hobby is it? Watching other people working? [Site Manager] There's all waves in this. So, buy a boat. [laughing] It's not that bad you know, it's hardly noticeable. All right, I'll knock it down a bit for you. Ah take no notice of him, Dixie, he's after medals. That's your lot. Not bad for half a days work, lads. [Yosser] Oh thank you, Daddy. You all right, George? Not bad, Chrissie, first day back, you know. You work hard you lads do. Not like I expected you know. You're not the only one. Hey listen, what's the nightlife like in this dump? Best ask one of the locals, I'm a Geordie. Newcastle. I thought it was all the same. Ooh, I should keep that opinion to yourself here, son. So you're subcontracted as well are ya? Aye. Where are you going next? Shetlands. Shetlands? No New York, I was only tricking you. Bags of bloody work up there, you know, if you fancy it? Money and all. Yeah well, I was sort of thinking along those lines as a matter of fact. See ya. Kev? Come ahead there! Hey up, gyppos. Keep your hands on your tools, boys. Hello there boys. Doing a great job here. Great, very nice indeed. Funny looking for a Clark of Works, isn't he? Looks for all the world to me like an Irish tinker. [laughing] Are you, er, are you boys from Liverpool? No, we're six Russians with bad chests. [laughing] All right, what do you want? And whatever it is, you can't have it. Oh come on now lads, don't be like that. Hey, we've met enough of your sort round here. One minute you're here all sweetness and shite and the next minute our equipment's gone. No, no, no friend. You're no friend of mine, friend. Look don't go tarring us all with the same brush. I do admit though, there would be some that- Not some, all. On ya bike. Don't be like that, we mean you no harm. Oh well all right, it's a fine job your doin', it's a shame. If that's the way you want it, it's a fine chance you're missing. Ready money. No questions asked. Ah well. Readies? Yeah, but gyppos, Yoss. Yeah suppose so. Nah, I don't know some good gyppos. In Walton cemetery. Come ahead there lads, let's get going, we'll be late for tea. Wonder how much? Ah sod it, come on. No harm in finding out. Hey, you's two, bugger off out of it. I'll chase them, Dixie. Have some more bread and butter, love? All right, let's have a drink then. Ey? Just a drink, nothing more, no commitment, right? All we do is have a look see. Nothing ventured, nothing gained! Ta. The way I see it, all we do is have a look at the job, see if it's sound, find out what's needed and if we can handle it. I dunno, Yosser. I mean we're here like, aren't we? Bleedin' Middlesborough. It's not like we're back home where we know everyone. And gyppos and all. Look I'm not saying we fall in love with the sod, Chrissie. I'm just suggesting we see if we can do business with him. Our way. We control our end of it from start to finish. Take the money and run. What do you think, George? I mean, you know, gyppos? Once bitten, twice bitten. You won't be bitten, not if we control it. Anyway, I said I'd meet for a drink and I'm going. Come on, where's your get up and go? Where's your guts gone? We rob 'em, right? We rob the gyppos we rob whoever we're doing the job for. Chrissie hit the nail right on the head, just now. We're here. We'll never be here again. Who knows us here? No-one. We're sound, boys, we're safe! And then next week we're gyppos. We fly by nights, we're on the rob, for us, not McKenna. Listen, the meek inherit a kick in the balls. Had a good look, pal? Look, everyone's on the rob. Just some are better at hidin' it than others. Or some get better chances to do it. Like, Loggo, here would rob something every day of his life. Like the cruet set you just put it in your pocket. -Jesus and everything. -[laughing] You count how much, how much you've ever made out of it in your life, Loggo. And it won't add up to what McKenna and his kind make in a week. Oh come on, let's be somebody. Let's live, let's do something before the worms get to us. Listen, I wanna be somebody boys and I'm gonna be somebody. Have you ever thought about being a politician, Yosser? Shut up, George. Anyway what have you ever made out of your life to tell me it's any better? I'm not disputing that, Yosser. I'm not saying you're wrong. But I used to think you were. But you are, you're right. And you know what, we deserve everything that they throw at us. We deserve to be stewed in our piss because we let them do it to us. There you are. I've just been saying that. Hey, and I'm not gonna take it lying down. I'm gonna look after myself. Aye, just yourself. Who else, ey? We're out here on our own you know. Do you think anybody cares when you live or die except yourself? Ah, come on. Well who's going to cry for you then, Chrissie, you're friggin' pigeons? Nah, you're wrong. All right, Yosser. You do what you want. You be rich and important. Be the big man. But remember this, you'll find out when you get up there, that shower, they're no better or happier than us. Whens Holy Communion Father? George? Are you all right? You're not, are ya? You shouldn't be here if you're not well. Chrissie, I'm better now than I will be. He used to be a communist, you know. Did you know that, Yosser? Yeah. Look where waving the red flag and being good's got him. A week in Middlesborough doing a job he's too old and too sick to do. Me dad went like that you know, the stomach. Yeah. Well are you in or not? [Loggo] Look, we'll meet him, Chrissie. [Chrissie] What? [Loggo] We'll meet them. [Chrissie] Oh yeah, yeah. I suppose so. Aye, great. And look we'll work out a plan, okay? I don't think life's like that anyway. [Yosser] Well your soon gonna find out. I'd rather be happy than anything. You will be, lad. You will be. But I already am. And if I'm out having a drink with the lads, I don't want you running around. Are you listening to me? Yes, Dad. [Dixie] You're not. I know, Dad. Look at me. You're in a proper hotel now with proper people. Don't go gawping at them like that all the time. Where's your manners? Going for a drink hey lads? Er, no not just yet, Dixie, about 10 minutes all right? See you down there, right? Sure thing, you can bank on it. See ya. You go the pictures, Kev, right? And not Emmanuelle or one of them. [Kevin] Yes, Dad. Will you stop looking at that girl for Christ's sake. Honestly. When I was your age. [background chattering] It's very kind of you to come along, boys. Yeah we know, we're the good Samaritans in disguise now come on, what's the score? That's what I like, you see. The man is straight down to business. [laughing] Where is it and what is it? It's a, it's a farm. Oh aye, laying tarmac on cabbages are we, ey? [laughing] No, no, no. You see, it's a lane and a bit of an old -courtyard, yeah. -[Loggo] How big? Well it's, it's quite big. Well how many yards then? Give or take. It's a lot, a lot. Fuckin' hell, 20 questions again, aye. How many? Well you see the thing is, the lane is 1400 square yards and the courtyard is another 50, 55, 60.. Another 300 square yards? Well there abouts. Ah Jesus, let's go. Yeah, not half. What are you doing? Hey, that's not a wee tot at all, you shouldn't have done that. You'd be talking about 1700 square yards, Yosser. Yeah, we thought it'd be somebody's path, pal. Yeah a couple of hours work we could know it off in the dinner hour, like. Look lads, don't be too hasty. At least finish your drink. But that's out of our range, Yosser, by about 1000 square yards, innit? All right, hang on a minute, ey? Go on finish what you got to say. Oh there's nothing more to tell really. It's like your man said, it's about 1700 square yards. What's your plan in it all? We lay the hardcore. Why aren't you laying the rest? Money. It's out of our range as well. And you see, we don't have the access that you have. Well we don't have it neither. We can rob a tonne or two but nothin' like that man. Why did you take the job on in the first place? It was too good to refuse. You see the fella was standing there with the money in his hand. We had a gang all lined up if the truth be told me. Unfortunately they left us a week ago without telling us. So now you're stuck? [Gyppo] That's about the size of it. Well boys, what do you think? And your man is there, for the taking. The farmer? Well, he's sound enough, he won't run away. You know, before we arrived on the scene, he had an estimate from one of the big firms. Double ours boys, double. Aye and double the job no doubt, ey? But he's not to know that is he? How much you charging him? £1.60 a square yard. How much does McKenna charge? I don't know exactly, but a lot more than that. Oh well them big firms, they've got big overheads, -costs, maintenance. -Yeah all right, all right,. I'm not soft, I know that, all right? I'm not suggesting that you are, you know- Now before we start, what's your part in all of this? What do you mean? Oh come on, come on. What's your rake up? What's in it for you. Oh, I see, yes, well the money from -the hardcore. -And er, 20 pence a square yard on the tarmac. All the rest is yours. So we have to lay the tarmac for what? 140 a square yard? Right. What's 1700 140s? Well 1700 times a pound is what? £1700. And 1700 40ps is, er. Well it's a lot of money, Yosser. And you're taking, what, 20p a yard? Nah, nah, it's too much. I'll tell you what we'll do with you. You give us the money for the added equipment and the black stuff and we'll do it for you. Oh, we haven't got it neither though have we? Otherwise we'd be standing outside the door hiring fellas for a tenner a day. Yeah, but we can't get over that kind of money. In advance. It's been nice meeting you, boys. Yeah, see you, lads. [distant talking] All right? Great, you're doing great. Dixie's right we should be on the frigging stage. You watch, they'll be over here in a minute making us a better offer. Yeah but all that money, Yosser, and the hire of the gear. Not to mention disappearing off the site for a day and a half. I mean what's Dixie and McKenna gonna say? Sod them, they're the least of our worries. Hey up, they're here. Look, um, I tell you what? To be honest with ya, Me and Dominic was having a little talk and maybe you're right, maybe 20 pence a yard is a little bit too much. If it'll help you at all, we'll drop it to 10 pence a yard, how's that? Well that's very generous of you. And well, yeah, we'll take you up on that. Fair enough. But it's getting the money together, that's the real sweat. Ah yes, well you see that's where we come unstuck as well. Yeah, right, all right, fair enough. Well, look, I'll tell you what we'll do, we'll think about it and we'll ring you at your digs tonight. Okay? Give us the number and we'll ring you there. Ah well, we're not exactly on the phone you see. We sleep in that. Ah, I wondered what the milk bottles were doing in the back. Oh no, we're going to get a new one though. As soon as this jobs lined. Oh a lovely motor, that's the real purpose behind it, you understand? Yeah, yeah. Well we're all after something, innit? All right well you ring us then. We're at the Martin Hotel, right? Numbers in the book. Ask for Mr. Hughes. That's the Martin Hotel? Right. Right you are son. You know now being honest, that 20 pence a yard's a little too much, you know. But if it's helping you at all. At all, at all, at all. At all, at all, at all, if we stuck it down to 10 pence or what? Their number up to here, boys. Lay the hardcore. At their own expense. Set up a gang to lay the black stuff. Who promptly disappear. So there they are, money down the drain and they're sweating on us to get it back for them. We've got them by the short and curlies. Hey, but don't forget. A, we've got to get the money together. And B, they're gyppos. They're cunning bastards. Not compared to us, Chrissie. They're not conning Joe Soap member of the public now, you know. They're dealing with men who've spent all their working lives in the game. So how much have you got in the bank? I've got a little bit for a rainy day, like. I haven't got a bank account. Me tart sticks it in the post office. How much is a little bit, Loggo? Just under 200. About the same I think, maybe a bit more. Well we're laughing then, aren't we? Are we? Course we are! I've got over 400 tucked away from Saudi for a sunny day. Between us that's 800 quid. But how much is the job gonna cost? Not that much, I'm telling you. Listen, you work it out for yourselves. 1700 yards at 150 a yard, I've just done it, is £2,550. Two thousand, five hundred and fifty pounds. Over £1500 profit. For two days work. [whistles] [Chrissie] Well, what about McKenna, if he finds out? Who cares! [Chrissie] Oh come on, Yoss, jobs aren't that easy to come by. Come on, Chrissie, this is just the start lad. Look, with the profit from this and the money we put into it ourselves. That's near enough two grand. What did McKenna start with? The cash from a lorry load of knocked off Mars bars, that's what, I'm telling you. We're in business, boys. [Chrissie] Come on, we're in business? I can see it now. The three of us in partnership, joint managing directors, ey? Business cards. Advertising in The Echo, buying our own van. Moving in on the market. Low prices. High quality. Tarla tarmacadam specialists. Tarla? Yeah, hey good name that, innit, hey? Tarla! [laughing] On the side of the van, ey? On the side of all the frigging vans. Big, red lettering on a bright yellow background. Tarla! Hey, people won't forget it. Yeah, yeah all right. But tell me, how are we gonna get the money up here, ey? [Yosser] You go to the bank, same as you do at home. What about me? [Yosser] Phone your tart. We haven't got a phone. Your pigeons. [Loggo] Ah, give over, Yoss. Hey, no! No straight up that, ey? Your pigeons, send a message home in one of your frigging pigeons, Chrissie, ey? Ah yeah you tell your missus to take her money order out, it'll be here the day after next, just right! See look come on, man, it's all falling into place it's destiny, boys I'm telling you, it's destiny! [smacking sound and groaning] What was that? [smacking sound and groaning] There he goes again! The massage parlour next door, innit? [groaning] Jesus, some massage. Would you listen to that? [groaning continues] [repeated slapping and groaning noises] Um excuse me, Mister but- I'm in a hurry. But um, how much is it to um, get in there? Four pounds. For a massage. [laughing] Go on you randy little ram. Yeah, wait till we tell your old man. You know, I was only listening. I was just walking past. Hey how old are you now, Kevin? 16 is it? -Nearly 17. -Nearly 17, ey? Hair on the chin. The old sap rising. -Desperate for a bit of dick- -Get lost, Loggo. [Loggo] Hey, you've never had it, have you? Come on admit it, you've never had it? Never had what? You know. Course I have! Lots of times. [laughing] Where's your dad? He went out looking for you lot. Dead mad and all. What's so funny? Nothing. Except he's gonna be doing a lot of that in the next few days, looking for us and getting mad. So it's what, four pounds to get in there for a massage, ey? Well how much you got? I've got loose change as well. Well there you go, Kev. One massage. Don't tell me dad, will you? Now what do you think we are, ey? What are ya laughing at? Well listen, we'd like you to return the favour for us, like. What do you mean? Well, we're all gonna be in here keeping our fingers crossed, innit boys? But we might have a bit of trouble listening with how you're getting on. So this is what we want you to do, right? [laughing] [Woman] Come in. [Kevin] Er. Yes? Have you seen me dad? No, son. Good, great, thanks. It was um you, earlier, I wanted to see, as a matter of fact. [Woman] Yes. Could you speak up please, I'm a bit deaf? [distant laughing] Get a brew on, Kev! What can I do for ya? Pardon? What can I do for ya? You tell me.

I'm all yours. Now just take your clothes off for me will you? There's a good lad. All my clothes? For four quid? Oil or talc? [Kevin] Hmm? Do you want to be massaged with oil or talcum powder? Oh. Urm. Yeah. Oil. And your guitar? Does your guitar want oil or talcum powder? Now, I'm gonna take off your towel and I'm going to caress you all over. Ooh what a lovely young body. I like virgins. Oh, I'll disappoint you no end then. Jammy little sod. I'll make him work tomorrow. I'm not staying here to listen to that. I'll get too excited to sleep. Yeah, it's a good job it's pigeons you got there, Chrissie, and not sheep, innit? Anyway, I think I'll bob a cab into town. See what the talent's like. Stay here and join the queue. Hey, don't forget fellas. Tomorrow is a start of a better life. See ya, Yosser. See ya, Yosser. Hey, Chrissie, what do you really think, ey? Oh hey, I wish I knew. Hey, just think what we could do though, ey? But all that bleedin' organising. Hey? I tell you what. Let's have a word with George. Hey, Tarla! [laughing] [Woman] Now wasn't that good? There you are. Turn over and I'll do it to you, the other way. George? [snoring] But it's only quarter past 10. Ah he won't be used to it, he's been off for a month. Hey, Chrissie, what's the matter? What are the pills for? Their painkillers, Loggo. Come on, we'll ask him tomorrow. Yeah, go ahead. You go. [Yosser] Look, you don't have to go just yet, Maureen. Maureen, listen.

Yeah, I know. In fact there's not a lot wrong with you at all, is there? Do you do anything else? You know, apart from what you've just done? Supplementary benefits, you mean? Not for four quid love. How much then? Too much. And not for you, pet. Now go on. You get on before your dad finds you. Just tell us how much? 15, now go on, get dressed. Where are you going? Won't be a minute.

Not in this case, George, he's only doing it so he can get a good sun tan for his holidays innit, ey? If there's one thing I can't stand it's someone looking over me shoulder all the time. Christ almighty, will you look at him. He'll be pitching a tent out there soon. Sod that for a laugh, I'm gonna phone McKenna. Hey you, stay outside where I can see you!

But those are the rules, Sir, for everyone. For everyone in working clothes, you mean? [Bank Clerk] No it's not- I wanna see the manager. I'm afraid. You'll be more than afraid in a minute, lad.

Soft spot and waves. Well we didn't lay the hardcore. It's not out fault if it wasn't excavated properly. You should've seen it. It was going dark, wasn't it. Not my problem, yours. I want it dug out. [moaning and exclaiming in the car] That's gonna set us back a week that! And then I want some more hardcore put down and rolled again before the black stuff.

Depends on what? On whether you'll tell Dixie or not. What do you think I am? It could also depend on whether you want to give us an hand, George. Yeah, three of us. Bit short handed that. Ah, come on now, leave George out of it. He's got a lot more- Let George answer for himself. What do you say to fifty nuts in your hand tomorrow night, George?

All right there? Yeah, yeah, but look where is everyone? That's what I wanna know? Well I'll tell you the truth, Macka. I don't know. I mean, they seem to have sort of like, you know, just bloody gone missing. I mean the van- Look, they're doing a bloody foreigner. No they're- And you let 'em, Dixie. In the middle of all this, with a job half ruined, you let four fellas go and disappear on you. I haven't heard a thing, Macka, honest. Look, er, I'll see you in a bit then. Oh go on, get in there, Doris. But, Jimmy, it makes me feel funny. I said, get in! And you know what you can do? You can start looking at the situations vacant column. Er, just circle around will you, Frank? I'm looking for four fellas and a few tonnes of tarmac. Come on, Chrissie, stretch it. It'll take a bit more. It's bloody thin now, Yoss. Here, don't just stand there. I mean, Jimmy, it's all open bloody countryside. Yeah, yeah, all right, look let's er. Hey hang on, Frank. Could you go to your right a bit there, please? Nah, it's too big an operation for. Hey, Frank, move a bit closer there will you? [laughing] Well, well, well. Who'd thought that life on a farm would appeal to the likes of Yosser Hughes. Hey, that's the same as the one by the site, I wonder who it is? What's with the flying squad? McKenna. Bloody hell. [Yosser] Ah sod it, come on. [laughing] And who's brilliant idea is this then, ey? Yours, Yosser? Bet it's your mad cap scheme, innit? [laughing] It's cracker. Absolute cracker. You come here and say that, McKenna. Oh who said I'd come to you? I've come this far, that's far enough for me. But it's the rest of you's that I feel sorry for, you know. I mean, you've always done me proud. You've never let me down. Always done a good job. I mean it'd be a shame to see you all go, you know, on account of some piss artist. Look, I'll tell you what I'll do. Loggo, Chrissie, George, look get yourselves back on the site by er, by two thirty. Er, no look make it three o'clock, all right? And we'll forget it ever happened. I mean we'll have a laugh about it sometimes. What d'ya say? Ah, come on, look we all make a fool of ourself sometimes. Others let a fool do it for us. You watch what you say, McKenna, I'm not scared of you. I mean listen to sense will ya, fellas? I mean what's ahead of you after this job, apart from the dole queue? Ah, now that's where you wrong you see, McKenna because- And you too, George. I mean standing there with one of my spades, you old bugger. How long have I worked for you Mr McKenna? Jimmy, call me -Jimmy, George. -[George] How long? Well it's eight, nine years now? I'll tell you this much Mr McKenna. You couldn't care less whether I lived or died. [McKenna] Oh now, George. And then all I do is stand by a man handle of black stuff. Nine or ten hours a day, five or six days a week. Shovelling, pushing and dragging. Just to make you and your kind that little bit richer. [McKenna] Look, George, perhaps I sort of underestimated what you've been feeling here. [George] Could've been worse, I suppose I could've been suffocating in a factory for 40 years. [McKenna] Out in the weather! Do you know that's what I miss now that I'm stuck in an office all the time. Mr. McKenna. Sir Jimmy. You can stick your job right up your big fat arse. [laughing] Well you stupid old git, George. I only kept you on cause I took pity on ya. Now look, you listen to me. You've all been caught off the site with my equipment. Aye, typical. Robbin's always wrong when you're rob a little from some, but not when you rob a lot from many. Shut it, Robin Hood, just crawl away and die will ya? All right. All right, you wanna play funny buggers? You don't go back on the job. You get out that hotel tonight, you make your own way home and you collect your cards from my office by Friday. You're finished, do you understand me? You're finished. Yeah, well that's where you're wrong McKenna. That's where you're wrong, you see? Cause we're only just starting. We're going into business for ourselves, McKenna. [laughing] You? You, Yosser? You couldn't organise a funeral in a cemetery. And I'll tell you this much. You start off on my patch and I'll cut you off from every source of supply that there is. Stone, machinery, equipment, asphalt, the lot. You won't what frigging hit ya. [helicopter engine starts] Well we'll see about that, McKenna. Hey, we'll see about that. Hey I'm gonna have more than one stinking shirt, McKenna. Hey I'm gonna have a suit for every day for the week. I'm gonna have a jet plane, McKenna! And I'm gonna go to Lourdes, get cured, come home, divorce the missus and marry Rita Hayworth. God knows, there's nothing like hope. Dixie? Forget it. Hey look, Dix, you know, we never. [car engine travelling into distance] Have you seen him? [Gypsie] The farmer? Yeah, what did he say? Oh, delighted. Good well you better go get the money sorted out, hadn't ya, cause we've finished here. Right, I'll do that. Hey? Just the one of you. The other stays here with us. Not that we don't trust you or nothing like that. And tell him not to drive anything over it for the day at two. You know, let it settle. [laughing] Bloody swine! Bastard! He promised faithfully, didn't he? He told me down right, didn't he? [Gypsie] What? This. You said readies. I'm only going on what he told us. Look, I swear to God. Well, we'll see about that. You see you finished the job too quickly, he thought it'd be tomorrow. Look he's delighted, don't upset the man. Yeah well a fat lot of good that is, he's gotta have money. But it's all right, it's all right. He phoned the bank. They're expecting us. We can cash the cheque any time. Well what time is it now? It's 10 to 3. Just right, the banks close at half three. Come on, lad. Hey, whoah. Where do you think you're going? Oh, we just thought we'd go to the bank and cash the cheque. And come back and pay us? Right. [laughing] Oh no. No, you, you go. Him, he stays here with us. Cause we like his, er company. Oh, Jesus. Ey, d'you see the problem? They thought that we'd cash the cheque, take the money and- Oh and do the? [laughing] Listen. I tell you what I'll do with ya. I'll be back here in half an hour with the readies. Now we can't say fairer than that, can we? Oh yes you can. You can take one of us with you. Suit yourself. I'll go. [car engine starting] Could murder a brew. Could murder a gyppo if his mate's not back soon. Oh leave it out, Yosser. I mean he's only been gone, what, quarter of an hour? Besides, Chrissie's with him anyway. I know. That's what's worrying me. Hey are you sure this is a shortcut? Yeah, straight up the lane and down into town. We seem to be going round in circles. Soddin' things been doing it all the week. Hey, do us a favour will ya? Give it a bit of an old push? That'll fix it. [engine starts] I should have gone with him. I should have bloody well gone with him. How long have you known this fella? Brendan? Oh well it's a while. How long is a while? Well we did a job like, but, er, we got laid off, like, a few weeks back. A few weeks? Oh, Christ, well that's it then isn't it, ey? He'll be off, pal. [Loggo] Well Chrissie's gone up there with him. Yeah, come on, and he said half an hour it's that now, where is he? Oh relax will you, you're making us all on edge. Hey? What bank was it? The cheque, what bank? Now look, how the hell would I know you? You wouldn't let me go off! [Yosser] You must've had money off him before? Come on? Well yes we have. But then again. What? Well it's like you say, we have had checks off the farmer, but then again, Go on. It's just that, that. [Yosser] What? It's just that the bank we went to before was that way but but Brendan went off on. The other frigging way. Oh, Jesus Christ. You've been done, pal. We all have. Come on. About this check. What check? The check you g- You gave him cash didn't you? Aye, aye, what are you up to? I was only looking at the. [groaning and punching] Loggo! [Gypsy] Brendan! Loggo! George! [Gypsy] Brendan! The keys, Yosser. Brendan, Jesus! [engine revving] What kept ya? Watson kept me. Well I had to wait for the big fella, you know the one with the muscles, to go to the house. Ah well never mind. Just because we are Irish, they think we're soft in the head, hmm? [laughing] [tyres screeching] Jesus they're following us! Didn't you get the keys? I did yes, but. See the old fella sort of lept on me and tried to- Get in the back and open the door. What? Just do as I tell ya. Hey, you're dead you are, pal. Dead.
