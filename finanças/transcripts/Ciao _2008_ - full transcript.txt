CIAO = An Italian Greeting used either on arrival or departure. Hello Mark. How are you? I called you yesterday and left you a message. Did you get it? I want you to know that I will arrive on the 25th and leave on the 27th. I will try to call you later to give you knowledge of my itinerary. I am very anxious about this. Dear Andrea. I am sorry but Mark is no longer among us. He suffered a car accident. He died last week. I'm Jeff. It was his friend. I have checked the your e-mails and answering them. I was not aware someone would come visit him. I hope there's still time to change their travel plans. I apologize for the inconvenience. Hello Jeff. Hard to believe what happened to Mark. Seems like just yesterday we talked on the phone. I suppose that Mark not told you about me but I live in Italy. We met online and went find us first. He had planned to go see him after going to a friend's wedding in New York. I bought a cheap ticket. I think I will not use anyway. Sorry, Jeff. I regret it very much. I took a look at your computer and found e-mails. Eastern them? I know I said I would not move in his stuff unless he had to do it So the East, right? Few. Not all, more than a thousand last year. What is speaking? Of their lives, what they do, who they are... Were in love? I do not know. Must be one of these things that we always hear, people wanting find themselves after they met online. Mark can not imagine doing that. Neither do I! All I know now there's nothing... Right. I do not think it's just sex I mean, I am sure which is partly, I'm not naive. But... It seems they had common interests and opinions. They talked about movies, music, politics, current events, stuff like that. It's like when I was with him, but... is different. How? It expresses itself in a much more open. What do you mean? Well, sort of, there is an email in which he recounts a story about his mother when he was in college. She went to get Mark to airport for the day of Thanksgiving, he noticed that she had a hole in socks. Right... So... he started crying in the car because... she had spent $ 300 a ticket, and neglected to buy themselves a pair of socks. He never told this story. I can not imagine Mark so emotional. People usually are when you write. Confidential whole series of things would not do that with people closer. Did you find some pictures of this Adrian? It's Andrea. Andrea. Means 'angel' in Italian, right? Yes .. I think so. No, I did not find any pictures of him. Surely there is somewhere in computer, not so earnestly sought. I was afraid to find out more, to be honest. Yes, you can find something pretty scary. I think it should not be so surprised. I knew he had his flirts. Just did not know that someone so far away. You gonna answer it? I do not know. I suppose I should. He must have meant something to Mark. Hello, Jeff! Hello Larry, how are you? Well How have you been? I'm fine, thanks. I just came to leave it here. Are the things that he asked me to bring his house. Right! And some checks that arrived by mail. Yes, thanks. Come in, please. I found this in my armpit, I do not know what it is. I found it when I was taking a shower. Let's take a look. Is there somewhere. Yes, I see it. What is it? It's a stain on the skin. Just need to remove it. That's it? Do not need a biopsy? No. It is benign. Are you sure? Absolutely. It is the only one? As far as I know. Let's check the other arm just to be sure. No, everything clean. Not to worry. It's just a piece of skin hanging. Could prescribe me also something to help me sleep? I took nothing is working. Ever had trouble sleeping? Sometimes, not always. Just have been more difficult to sleep lately. Is under some stress? I think not. Smoker? Well, I smoked. I left it for several years. There are some big changes in your life? At work? Well .. I think there... Yes? Sorry Doctor, Dr. Carlos called by it, said it is urgent. Okay. Sorry Jeff, I gotta go meet. OK Why do not you lie down a little? I'll be back shortly after take some things to remove that stain. Absolutely. Sorry about that, it will be just a minute. No problem. Hello! I am. I left some things in your parents house. Seem far away. So that's it. Just wanted you to know. Then just send a mail a copy of death certificate? It's enough to cancel the account? Okay. I think he had a form of electronic surveys. Yes. Okay. Can you give me the address? Wait, let me get a pen. Dear Andrea, I was thinking about your trip. I would suggest that keep your plan and come anyway. It's just for a weekend and can stay with me. Do not feel the obligation. You may already have decided it is better not come. Just know that it is more than welcome. Jeff? Andrea? Hey, hello, how are you? I'm fine. Welcome to Dallas! Thank you. Had to wait long? My flight was delayed. I called and left a message. I received. I just arrived in fact. Do you have any luggage? Just one. This is not how I thought it would. What to expect? Cowboys in the desert. Perhaps a century ago. It's definitely very different from New York. By LA Yes, but we need car here as in LA It's all so far? Not a city for walking. You travel a lot? Where else was in the U.S.? San Francisco Philadelphia Chicago, and Des Moines, Iowa. What did you do to Des Moines? I had a friend there. Want to borrow? Andrea? I'll have a''Tendero Ventuccio''. Where are you from? Italy. Welcome to Dallas. Is this your first visit? Yes, it is the first time. How long will it be here? Only a few days. Enjoy your stay. Thanks! And you? I want it 32. Pollo al Miglio? Thank you! You speak Spanish? I took classes when I was in college. Furthermore, Spanish is much like the Italian. - Oh, right. Both came from Latin. - Yes. Your English is quite fluent. I mean, not that I was not expecting that. Well, my mother was an English teacher, then think I do better than most Italians. Doest work for the Web, right? How do you know? Your e-mail to Mark. I read some of them. I have not read everything, e. .. Look at Andrea, I do not want think that was spying on... No problem, right? Were curious did not know anything about me. So... Yes I am a graphic designer, freelancer, self-employment, I especially websites. What do you do? I am a financial planner. Working in a bank here. How was New York? There was a wedding, right? Yes My friend Vince married. Go to school together, in Genoa. Then she volunteered to a school of UNESCO in India... Cool! He met an American girl... They had a very good reception. Find there his family Italy was a bit surreal... What do you mean? Ah! Because you're used to seeing them in Italy and met with them e. .. Yes .. are people who see usually at home and see them there seemed... Makes sense. Your family is here in Dallas? Only Lauren, my half-sister. My mother lives in Houston with my stepfather. My real father lives in St. Louis with his family. Right. Where are you from originally? Waco. Waco... David Garresh? Our ticket to fame! But remember Jennifer Love Hewitt. She is also from Waco? She was born there. Not far from here, right? No, about two hours to drive. So too are a Texan? Yup! But not detect an accent. 'Slipped' from time to time in some words, like, still say "Y'all." What is "You all". How is it used? Y'all never heard''''? Say for example, I I say "Have a nice day!" If someone else is with you and I I'm talking about, or a group of people. Type... Yo all? As if it were a single word, "Y'all." It has to be softer. Youall Now it further. "Y'all" As if you had to scroll a bit of tongue. Y'all? Quite close. Could also be a Texan, you know? Mark had an accent. I thought it was quite charming. He was a smaller town. Longview. Longview, Texas. I knew he wanted me learn to dance "country"? Really? Yes. He sent me a DVD. One of those instructional videos, but it was hard for me to learn. Then said Mark to teach me that when he came to Dallas. Also dances "country"? No! I'm pretty bad at any kind of dance. But Mark was dancing every week. There's a bar here "Country Western "that he attended. It's funny to imagine me just to do that, you know? What? Country dance? Yes! Use the cowboy hat, jeans and boots. Can you imagine me like that? I'm Italian... Mark had a way of convincing people to do things they normally would not do. Never told him how much I I hated country music, for that matter. I also am no fan... He was always making me CDs corpora, trying to convert me... but I could not like it. He sent me some CDs too... but... not even had the courage to tell him what I thought of them. I found them interesting, however, letters, they do not... "Turns to the subject give" you know? - You mean "they turn to the subject." - Give back to the subject, right. The lyrics revolve the issue. I love you, miss you, I'm so alone. It is very practical front. If you need a blanket, is in a closet. But now it is quite hot, so probably you will not need. OK. The bathroom is down the hall. Leave some towels there for you. Cool! Grazie! Excuse me? It means thank you. Oh, right! You're welcome. This is your room? Where you gonna sleep then? I have a sofa bed in the room. - I can sleep there. Stay with your room - No, no! Okay, I do not care. Are you sure? Yes It's quite comfortable, in fact, is more comfortable that my bed. So you'll be doing me a favor. Ok, thanks. Mark painted this? As guessed? He sent me to a few months. It... is smaller, but has more or less the same style. You know what this is? No, he did not like to explain to their works. He was very defensive about it. It's funny... With Yes mine too. Nor do I mean. This can be... an animal. Like an elephant. I do not know if it is to be something. Actually it's a bit ugly. A little? It's very ugly! He loved to paint. I guess he did not pay it. Of course I never told you. In fact, even encouraged him. So, this is partially my fault. Well, I told him I loved him sent me. So the blame is also mine. You did the right thing. He did not accept the criticism well. I've been meaning to ask you. Got something you want to do, while you are here? Something you want to see? We can go see Mark? Sure. Is it far? Not much. It is located in the northern part of town. If you do not mind to take me there... We can do it tomorrow. I'll let you install it. I have something for you. What is it? Pesto. Made by my mother. Cool! Must be nice. It is best, but... I am biased. Thank you. It's just a small reminder. You're welcome. Did not need, but really liked. Let's get some sleep. Tell me if you need something. Ok Thanks. Hello mother. Hello? Hello? Mother, do you hear me? I am. Hello Andrea! Can you speak louder? I hear ya too low. Better now? Yes, how are you? I'm fine. And you how are you? I wake you? No. You know I wake up early. It's all right there? Yes, yes, everything is fine. Where are you now? Also in New York? No, I came to Dallas today. Ah yes, you had to find yourself with a friend there. Yes. How is he? Okay. I'm at his house now. Have you eaten? What time is it there? No mom, I'm dying of hunger. Of course I've ever had! It's almost midnight here. How is he? It is nice? Yes, it's nice. It is very polite. Even gave me a bottle of "pesto" of the mother. It's really sweet! They did something after the pick up? Yes I took him to dinner. You've discovered something else about him and Mark? No, absolutely not. I'm still getting to know him. Furthermore, it is private. He tells me what I want to tell. You should meet him. You think? Yes, I leave you to do the questioning. Are you superstitious? Not at all. You are? My cat Caesar, had one of his Whiskers behind the monitor of my computer last year. At the time I had a lot of work. Then I cleaned my room and threw out the Whiskers. Guess what happened? What? The work stopped. Nothing came up for weeks. So, I put another whiskers on the same site. Yes, he was not pleased. I gave a slap on the monitor, and work back again. So. That's funny. Yes I think I'll spread more, putting the whole house. You stay rich. I hope so. Tell me more about where you live. Have you ever been in Italy? Well .. Genoa is not like Rome or Florence, if you know what they look like. I have an idea in general. Genoa is not as good as those places listed. It has a huge historical center, but is also a post-industrial city. So you can find architecture century. XIV alongside the 60 industries. - It is by the sea, is not it? - Yes, It has a seaport. Right. I'm wondering the map of the lessons of history. Where Christopher Columbus was born, right? Exactly. Usually I describe it to people San Francisco as a medieval and decadent, because it extends the hills, like San Francisco. So pretty. Some parts. Especially the mountains. We also have numerous old buildings, churches, museums... Mar and I talked about taking a months and travel around Europe. Really? Yes, but we could not find the time to do so. You know, one of those things we always say, that sounds like a good idea... Mark said he wanted me to go visit Italy. But I came here first. I just... my timing was not correct. You learned something from Danny? He moved to Seattle after separating. I called her to tell you about Mark. I thought it would come to the funeral, but did not appear. They have been together for so long, right? About five years. I wonder if he told you this, but... things had become even ugly at the end. Mark just said things had not worked among them. I did not ask why. Danny began using drugs. Really? What kind of drugs? Methadone, mainly. Began to engage in big fights. Once Mark came to me door with a bruise on his face. Danny hit him? No, they beat each other. There was a time when Danny was involved in something almost every night. Mark did not like to talk about it. I never made it with Danny. Why? He did not like me to spend time with Mark. I thought we were... intimate. You mean sexually intimate? Yes. And were they? No. Well, I mean, there was a time, but... not even aware we were drunk. What happened? Somehow we got in my bed. I knew I would not do anything, dresses were all the time. But at some moment of the night we kissed e. .. Anyway, when I woke up he had already left. So, never talked about it later? No, it's one of those things not mentioned. It's embarrassing. It is strange that you and Mark were not together. Why? I do not know. Looks like you two were made for each other. Were close. Are you forgetting one thing. What? Type. Age was not his. What you think is his type? I do not know. Someone with the most exotic. Preferably a foreigner. Maybe an Italian. That's him. Yes, when he was born. Took a photo of himself every year. He played football? It was very good at it indeed. He played up to university. It was his dog, Sammy. He died last year. What happened that? Did you know that he played rugby, right? Yes. Playing in a tournament London, broke his arm in the games. You were friends in college, right? Yes. How did you meet him? We were in the same dorm. He was two doors from him. He did not speak to me until we fallen into the same class a semester. We copy each other until graduation. We changed our campus and become roommates. What will happen to his house? His parents will put it up for sale soon. I'll have to help them pack everything when sold. I think it would not be able to do it alone. It would be very difficult. It's very nice of you. He would have done the same for me. I saw this room before. He sent me pictures. Feels like I knew him well. I wonder why he I never said anything about you. Thought that you would judge. Why do it? He told me that once you told him it just felt drawn to losers. Imagine what would you say if I told you that had a known type online, and from another country. What he said is partly true, I mean, before Danny was Edward, after the Fran?ois... None of them paid, one way or another. He also said that he needed therapy, before you start out with someone again. Yes, I said even that. I even offered to pay him the first session. I think he did not want think I was a freak, before I know. But... He wanted us knew, you know? Well, here I am. Do not know if this is it. Are you sure it still works? There must be... switch on the back. He bought it online. I would try to give him a beating when you come here. Never played in this before? Yes, when I was there for about 16 years. Come, let us fight each other. No, I'm just watching. I need to jump! I need... You just have to... Mine is damaged, is defective! No it is not broken yet. - You have to try better. - Okay, wait, wait. Do not hit me. Not so. You can not beat me while I'm trying... I'm trying to figure out how to do this move. I am trying to explain it. How did you do that? How did you do a fireball out of nothing? You can not make fireballs. It's my character. And what mine does? All he does is hit. You have to do a combo. So. A combo? Yes, a combo, carries on first and second button. First and second button. Cool! Rain! It's cool! What is the fucking rain? I do not know, but took half of your energy. You see this? It's the clutch, tighten and cute. One neutral, two and three. Think you can? I think we'll have to find out. Calm down! Calm down! How old were you here? An eight. It's your family? You look like you more... with your mother. It's what people say. Who is the girl? It is Lauren, my half sister. She is Asian? Chinese. Then your stepfather is Chinese? There is a picture of him somewhere out there. Here you are. How they met, he and your mother? Belong to the same church. Have been married for about 10 years. Salta this page, please. This really you? Yes, at the time was fat and I hated myself. And dye your hair? It was to be blond surfer, but was orange-punk. When do you take? In college last year. Then Mark was around. He took one week before me. A week? Why a week? One day he asked me to meet with him in the library. It was a place that was truly isolated and private. It was me and three girls. We were there trying to imagine what was going on. Then he came up with this, from nothing. Unexpected. And this before we have any type of support groups on campus. I was stunned, but all others were happy and supported. I guess I should have said something like "This is it!" Or something stupid like. I called him a week later and told him it was too, but... was not even angry I have taken a week earlier. It was too late. Yes He expected me assume the same time as him. I had a friend in high school. He sat near me in class. We were somewhat close, but I was in love with him. Tortured me with stories about of girls who had sexual relations. Typical. I saw it again recently, to say about a month, on the market. Held at least fifteen years since the last time I saw him. It's a long time. You are married. Three children. A true family man, you know? It was quite excited to see me, asked me my phone number. He told me: "We have to go have a drink together one day." But I do not know if I want to see again. Why not? Well, would ask questions about me. If married, -... to have a girlfriend... - Oh, right! Then you'd have to say: "Yes, I used to masturbate me Thinking of you fucking your girlfriend. " Yes, probably would not accept it very well. Absolutely nothing. The funny thing is... still dream about him every once in a while. Like, once a year dream to be in high school with Gian Lucca. I've been having dreams about Mark. It's like we're back to college, like, to walk together, do whatever... Until I can smell your deodorant. See that red sweater he would always use. It's hateful. And you... I felt him sitting beside me. It's all so vivid and real, you know? And then I wake... ''This pesto is great! Your mother must be a good cook. Yeah, but when you're in a bad mood, just leave shit... Here, put some of this on your chicken. What is it? Peach juice, mixed with yogurt and mustard. Own income? It was an accidental discovery in a buffet. My sister and I challenged ourselves to prove everything mistur?ssemos. Then she made a stew with jelly beans. And it was terrible! So, I made a sauce with juice orange, mustard and vanilla ice cream. Actually was not too bad, but I thought: "This is better able to know if I replace by the orange and peach ice cream for yogurt. " Then added a pinch of essence to balance. Voila! I liked the potato curry too. Usually do not like, but... this is a... unique taste. Not too spicy. It is the Chardonnay. Works wonders with curry. You should be a chef. It has long passed the age of a career change. It is never too late. In the end, better late than never. By Mark. By Mark. Who is your best friend in Italy? Have to be Diego. How is he? It's my age, slightly higher, naturally tanned skin. How old are you, anyway? Thirty-four, and you? Twenty-nine. Really? In what year were you born? 1978. Should not it be 1977? I did not want wert my financial planner. Okay, you got me. I have the same age as Mark. Anyway, I interrupted you when you were speaking of Diego. Where was I? Slightly higher with naturally tanned skin... Yes .. He has a very exotic. It is half Lebanese. Looks hot... Yes it is. You are intimate with Diego? No. Not one incident alcoholic who ended up in bed anyone? We met through my ex-girlfriend, and they are together now, so... Did you have a girlfriend? Yes. For how long? Six years. Really?! She is one of those people who like to be. We get on very well. So what happened? Lha discovered that lacked a dick. We know each other since high school. Did not come out until I was twenty or so. But... she always knew. Like Mark knew about you in college. He was already married. Really? Well, it was a deal. What do you mean? Well, he had a friend working in Venezuela, and she wanted to stay here. Then combined to she obtained a Green Card. She paid him to do that? No, he did so as a favor. Mark was like, did not matter what the people he liked. I wanted to ask you... What? The accident. How did that happen? He went his way to work. A truck moved into his lane. Then he changed to a faster track to avoid it. Was hit from behind by a truck at high speed. The car flipped. What happened to the other driver? Was injured but not critically. When you find? His father called me. I was in Houston to visit my mother. I returned by plane and went straight to hospital. He was... He was in a coma with massive brain damage. He died the next day. One nurse said... that when they took him he was still conscious. Just wanted to have been there, you know? Have you ever heard say, when someone dies, usually receives a signal before? Even when it is unexpected. Yes. When my grandmother died, the day before the death, she spoke with someone in the room, how to take... how to have a real conversation, but there was nobody there. Mark was very right things about the laundry. Never let dirty clothes accumulate. Was one of his foibles. But... been there a week before he died and the basket of dirty laundry was overflowing. Never seen that before. Perhaps the track that... never had to wash clothes. What was the last thing he told you? Goodbye... Until later. No. I mean... before the dismissal. Remember what he said? No, I do not know... Never thought about it. What was the last thing he told you? We talked on the phone, few days before the accident. And he said... What did he say? It's a bit cheesy. Promise you will not laugh. You promised. Yes! I promised! He said: Can not wait to have you in my arms. Excuse me. Come in, we're having dinner. You okay? Yes, yes... Would I come back later? Not so good. Andrea, this is Lauren. - Hello! Jeff talked a lot to you. - From you, too. How are you? Well, how about you? I'm fine. I'm fine. Jeff, you... ahmmm... fix the vacuum? What? Would ask for your loan. Remember? My broke down. Right! It's in the closet. I'll get. Want something to eat? - No. I ate. - Then sit down and drink a cup. Damm il soldi! I want butter. No! Give me your purse. Damm il soldi! Give me money. Right! Giusto! Very good. Here's mine. Wo ai ni Wo ai ni! Am I happy? I'm very happy? Wo ai ni! I like you? - Wo ai. Wo ai ni. - Ti voglio bene. I love thee? That's it! What did you say? Ti voglio bene. - Di Vuli bene. - No. - Ti voglio bene - Ti Volha bene. With a G, 'voglio'. Voglio. Ti voglio bene. Right! You can say its over? Wo ai ni. Wo... -... alas - Ai... -... ni - Ni... Wo ai ni. Perfect! It's your time Jeff. I do not know any foreign language. Get anything. How? Say something, something not understand. Ok Here's one. Is so dry that the trees are bribing the dogs. Oh, God! Not one of these! What is it? Texan? Texf?nico. Texf?nico? You mean like Cubone? So, you know what that means? I have no idea. Means that it will not rain. That does not make any fucking sense. Okay, let's easier. This applies to you, actually. "Gird thee to thy ball." What? What does it mean when I say that you should confine yourself to your own ball? Type: Put yourself in your life? Exactly! Right... So what do you think Dallas so far? It looks good. Actually I did not see much, but it looks cool. Honestly, coming from Italy, only that the site be cleaned up makes it beautiful. Do not show you the city, Jeff? We went to the house of Mark today. You should take him for a ride, you know, do some sightseeing. He leaves tomorrow morning. So soon? Yes. This is even a short visit. That's what Mark and I agreed. What was the deal? That would be two days sufficient for a first date. If we do not we give and we would not be forced to stay together for long. Right. And they got along well? Would be longer? Maybe! He said he wanted to go Italy to visit me if everything went well. I've done it before. Once. Remember Des Moines? Des Moines, Iowa? Yes. I had a friend there. I went to see a kind. He was someone you met online too? Yes. I should spend a week there. Damn! This is a bit embarrassing. Account! Well, he had not told me that was bipolar [manic depressive] demo us well but... But he stopped taking the medication, so it was acting in a very erratic while I was there. On the third day started yelling at me for no reason. So I was really scared, and grabbed me and went to a hotel. There is no one in Italy to date? People who live in 'Geneva'? It's 'Genoa' darling. Sorry, Genoa. Genoa! There is much to see here. It is not like Rome, you know? It is not easy to meet other types. So my social network is a bit limited and I end up meeting people online. Why do not Americans and Europeans? Because I have a fetish for Yankees Really? Is that why? No! Not so. Just... Sometimes talking to someone, online start talking, it establishes a link, and the person happens to be in... Des Moines, Iowa. Yes. Or Dallas, Texas. Exactly! It's not as if there was a geographical planning, as if I had to learn a kind of state. Minimal. I know it sounds crazy, make this journey every, thus far, to know a person, but every once in a while you talk with someone special. And try your luck! It was a pleasure to meet you Andrea! It was a pleasure to meet you too. Jeff, can you help me with the vacuum? Sure. Lets stay on the table. I already handle it. Okay, I can handle this. Ok, thanks. The vacuum, Lauren? I had to make an excuse, otherwise would be too obvious. Right! Very convincing. When will I get this back? Let him in my car, give you back tomorrow. The trunk is full. Will not fit here. I have some space in the backseat. You even by squeezing the details. He was more than happy to tell anyway. I think he likes you, the purpose. What makes you say that? Female intuition. You know, you should confine yourself to your own ball. As if thou hadst not thought of that! Good evening, Lauren! Good night! Gone? No, it happens once in a while. Pronto! Thanks for the help. Thanks for making me dinner. Your sister is funny. You think? Came here just to inspect, right? It's just your impression. It had to be blind not to realize. Ciao. Do not wake up, do you? The TV is too loud? No. I got up, I can not sleep. You do not? No, my medical prescribed me some pills stupefying,. but I think they give me headaches in the morning. You know what Mark used to do when unable to sleep? What? Beat jacking off. Never worked for me, though. I stay awake all night. Mark you loved? Excuse me? Mark you loved? Sure! He was my best friend. Were in love with him? There was a time that was. You were? In a way. In a way it was. He would have liked to have when you know you. I think you combine. You think? Yes, certainly. He knew what you felt for him. He told you? Yes. He greatly regretted not feel the same thing for you. I remember now the last thing he told me. When I took the flight to Houston. He asked me to convey his love to my mother. She liked him very much. It was the last thing I said. What was the last thing you said? Can not wait to know how you smell. Which one do you think your the most corny? The last thing he told me, or the last thing I said? Both are very heartburn. Yes, they are. What was the last thing you said? See you when I return. Got something you'd like thee see. I have observed you, in your eyes and your smile, is difficult to admit this to you, but every night I go to bed, thou have in mind, hardly sleep at night. I'm dreaming, three times per minute, Baby, you're it. Do not you let me be your man? I'm dreaming, five times per minute, Baby, I admit. Come on, let me be, Come on, let me be your man. You know, when I first saw you, online. He had a strange feeling in mind. Now I simply adore you, and every night when I'm in bed, I'm dreaming, three times per minute, Baby, you're it. Do not you let me be your man? I'm dreaming, five times per minute, Baby, I admit. Come on, let me be, Come on, let me be your man. Hope to see you soon Andrea. There are so many things here that you want to show. And then I met my friend Jeff. I'm sure you'll like. Ciao! Toma. Thank you. Are you okay? Yes. What time is your flight tomorrow? At about half past nine. It's getting very late. You should go get some sleep. You need anything else? No. Good evening Jeff. Good evening Andrea. It sets my alarm clock, not to fall asleep. Ok, thanks. You're going to Genoa from New York? It is a flight from JFK to London after London to Rome and then Rome to Genoa. It's a long flight. Thank you for inviting me. You are very welcome. Glad I came. Glad we met. Please keep in touch. Keep. You should come visit me in Italy. Yes? Yes. May is the best time is spring there. Okay. I must warn you now, though. Genoa is not as pretty as you think that Italy is. Dallas also is not beautiful. Ciao, Jeff! Ciao, Andrea! Translation and subtitling: NomadaPT
