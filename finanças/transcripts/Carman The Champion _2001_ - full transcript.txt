[Atmospheric music] [Atmospheric music] [Bell ringing] [Crowd cheering] This has escalated into one of the best fights of the year, if not the decade. Leone is doing more than holding his own. He's giving the champ a run for his money, and he's making it personal. Go! Left right, left right! The champ is down! Get to your corner. One! Two! That's it! A body shot and you're down? You wanted me, fight me! Fight me now! Hey, come on! You're a dead man, keshon! You're dead! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! You okay? Yeah. You wanna fight? Oh, yeah. All right. Box. [Bell rings] There's the bell signaling the end of round three. Give me that mouthpiece. What are you doing out there, huh? Don't be acting cocky. Cocky gets you hurt. I ain't trying to hear that. I'm tired of holding this bum up. [Bell rings] One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight--! [Rock music] [Rock music] [Female chuckling] Ooh! Freddie, Freddie, put her in the commercial too, man. This is good. This is good. Freddie, put her in the commercial, man. Make her a star. We all want in the commercial. Oh, man. Oh, it's rough life being me. [Rock music] [Rock music] [Rock music] Excuse me. Wait a minute. Keshon said we were gonna be in his commercial. He told you that? Yeah. Well, keshon says a lot of things. Here, this is for you, Teresa, is that right? Does it matter? And that's for you. That should take care of your airfare home. Have a good day, ladies. [Rock music] Orlando. Hold up. A guy here just got out San Quinton, needs a place to stay. He says he knows you. Yeah, yeah, come on up. I'll be back. Ah this is Victor michaelson. Mr. Leone. How you doing, Vic? I'm doing good. You don't remember me, do you? No. We met at the center. I knew your pops real well. I was one of the dumb ones, wouldn't listen. I'm really sorry about what happened. Maybe I could help some of these kids see the light, you know what I'm saying, before it's too late? You know, I mean I learned my lesson, now I want to help others, you know? Help them go straight so they don't have to go through what I went through. Here's a letter from the board of prisons and one from the chapel. So it's true, the story about you spending 3 or 4 million for this building for kids and knuckleheads like me? No, this was my father's. That's mine. It's still vacant. Bernard will take you through the rest of the procedures. Listen, can you wait outside for a second please? Yeah, sure. No problem. Yo, Victor. God bless you, man. Thank you, sir. [Helicopter blades whirring] [Helicopter blades whirring] [Helicopter blades whirring] [Helicopter blades whirring] Mr. Edland, good to see you. Orlando, I only have a minute. I'm on my way to San Diego. Best I can do is buy you a couple of months to come up with the balloon payment or i'm sorry, I'm gonna have to foreclose. I understand. Look, kid, when you put the big down payment on this place, you were the champ. In all due respect, things are different now. What about Alfredo? Now, I know there's some bad blood between you two, but you ought to give him a call. Mr. Edland, thank you for the extension. I appreciate it. All right, champ. Gotta go. [Rock music] The guy smells like new year's Eve. Well, I can only lead a horse away from water. I pay you not to let him drink. Yo, where my girls at? Budha, pull over. Turn that crap off. What? I thought I told you no booze. Look at me when I talk to you. September 7th, you fight the biggest fight of your life. No booze, no women. Do you understand what i'm saying to you? Yeah. Okay, budha. [Rock music] Orlando? Ma, what are you doing here? Orlando, take this. What is this? I took a loan out on the house. Ma, this is not gonna save the building. Orlando, if we lose this building, we lose everything. I know, I know. Believe me, I know. Whew, sometimes I just don't understand god. Papa was a good man. He loved people. He was always there for me. The left right combination to the head of Higgins. Now a good exchange as Higgins comes back with a cowering right hand. Whoa! What a blistering assault! He's getting hammered! Big left hook, stumbles to the rope, almost went down! [Ominous music] [Ominous music] Here they go again! The action just won't let up! Unbelievable! At this point, you have to wonder what they each have left. They come together again. [Ominous music] Have you seen Orlando? No, I haven't seen him. Where's Orlando? I'm not sure. I think he's up in the office watching the fight. Oh! They are toe-to-toe in the center of the ring, a wild exchange, fanatic pace. And Higgins is down! The referee steps in, and he has stopped the right. Orlando, come on. You have people waiting for you. Who won? Never mind who won. Bobby Van, knocked him out. Just come on, okay? Come on. Lets go. Hey, don't forget, fans, the next big fight will be September 7th. Yo, li'l drae, over here. Yeah! Step back, man. [Crashing] [Car alarm going off] Stay here. Come on, go, go, go. Hey! Go! Go! Pedal, go. Come on, man! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Watch it, man. Come on, pedal. Oh! Get off! Aw! Oh! Oh, my knee. You broke my knee! You're lucky I didn't break your neck. Come on, get up. You gonna call the cops? Worse. I'm gonna call your mother. Oh, huh, what is this? Yo, preacher man. Yo, big Mike. Give it up, homes. That stuff belongs to me, ese. You talking about this? You know you're a bad example for the youth. Best not be messing in my business, preacher man or you're a fool. Come down to the church sometime for fellowship. ♪ Jesus, Jesus is the light. ♪ Jesus, Jesus is the light. ♪ Jesus, Jesus is the light. ♪ Jesus, Jesus is the light. What are you, some kind of cop? When was the last time you were in church? ♪ Jesus, Jesus is the light. ♪ Jesus, Jesus is the light. ♪ Jesus, Jesus is the light. How's everybody doing tonight? Everybody all right? I don't know about you but I need a hug. You need a hug? I want you to turn to somebody and hug somebody you don't know. Hug somebody you don't know. Come on. Everybody needs it. What are you waiting for, fool, Christmas? Nah, it's just-- [Siren wails] Yo, he's got a gun. What up, big Mike? Just trying to find god, sir. You know where we can find him? What are you guys doing? Tu madre. Vamanos, Mikey. You try to have a very safe evening, okay officer? Caesar. Okay, every day you will come here, and you'll work for me. What? You are done running the streets. That's the deal. You ain't my father. Well, maybe you need one. Caesar? Mrs. Hererra? Why is my son handcuffed to this chair? You're Caesar's mother? I'm his mother, now please answer my question. Well, because your son-- I broke his car window, accidentally. That's it? Were you expecting more? I apologize for Caesar, Mr.-- Leone, Orlando Leone. He's a preacher, mama. If you don't mind, I have to get back to work. How much do we owe you? Nothing. Well, Caesar has agreed to work around the center here for me. So, Caesar, 8 o'clock, I expect to see you here sharp. Let's go. Can I walk you out? No, that's not necessary, thank you. Let's go. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Hererra. Give me that bike. Help me out. Get into the car. Get in! You broke into his car, didn't you? I don't appreciate being called away from my work all the time because of you, Caesar. No more, okay? No more! He's a boxer, mama. Who? The preacher. He was the world champion. He didn't hit you, did he? No. He made me go to church. Orlando, you snooze, you lose. Hey, Johnny. Hey, man, you want to hold me up a couple of rounds tonight? Ain't got time. Nice piece, where'd you get it? You know a kid named Caesar hererra? This his? I got it off of one of his homies who tried to bust in my car last night. He's a wannabe, been down to the station a couple of times. Slings dope for the stoners gang. Hey, you seen that kid's mother? Yup. Takes a tall, dark skin gal to make a preacher lay his Bible down. What about his father? I don't know, man. Maybe he ain't got one. Hey, I was talking to the assistant d.A. Last night. No problem getting you a permit to carry a piece. You know, I think preachers do better when they carry bibles instead of guns. Yeah, well you been drawing some pretty hard lines with them gangsters, man. That's why we got guys like you, to protect and serve. You sure you don't want to go a couple of rounds, huh? Nope, not tonight. Gotta go in. Hey, when you gonna give that job up? When it's time. When it's time. Yeah, when it's time. Orlando. Orlando. Yes, Mr. Lawrence. Get up to 12 now. I'm on my way. Don't ask, just deal with it. [Chuckling] [Puppies whimpering] Well, I guess you're all under arrest, eh? What a night. All right. Don't bite. Don't bite. [Rock music] [Rock music] [Rock music] [Rock music] [Rock music] Yo, I got you. I got you. I got you. Come on, what's the matter, baby? [Cell phone ringing] Yeah? Yo, Freddie. You better get over here. The champ's doing his thing again. What? You better hurry, man. All right. I'm on my way. Keshon, what did I do to deserve you? [Rock music] [Rock music] [Rock music] Attention, ladies and gentlemen. [Whistles] [Music stops] As unbelievable as this may sound, there are other people in this hotel. [Music continues] So if you-- [rock music] You, come on, baby. Stop, stop! [Rock music] [Music stops] All right, here's the deal. Anybody who is not a registered guest at his hotel is out of here. The party is over. Hey, punk. You know who's suite this is? [Female screams] Keshon, my man. Get out of my way, chump. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, snap. Did you just see that? Hey, corry. Get off of me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That fool upstairs is insane. You mean keshon? Yes, I do mean keshon. Whoa, wait, wait a second. We can make this thing all right, huh? I don't know what happened up there, but let's just take care of it, okay? There we go. Everybody's going with me if somebody doesn't talk to me. Now what happened to the girl? Officer, the girl is fine. I just put her in a cab. Turn that off. Get that out of my face. And who are you? I'm Mr. Banks' attorney. I said turn that--turn it off. Officer, I'm the hotel manager. Look, everything seems to be under control. Isn't that right, champ? Would you come with me, both of you. Come here. Come here. Now with your permission, my security chief, Mr. Leone, will escort everyone who is not supposed to be here out of my hotel! You still cleaning toilets for laracco, huh? Officer, I've instructed my client not to answer any questions. Unless somebody here has a specific complaint, I suggest we just call it a night, okay? No, it's not a night. Hey, hey, hey, chill! Chill! You better calm your client down. Champ or no champ, I will take him in. I will, officer. I appreciate your Patience, thank you very much. Budha. It ain't over between you and me, Mr. Security punk. It ain't over between you and me, you understand? Now I know who you are. I was at your last fight when you won the title. Man, I thought you were down for the count. Yeah, a few people thought I was down for the count. Okay, people, party's over. Let's go. The door's over here. Thank you for coming. Goodnight. Thank you. Gotta get a new home for you, get you some new friends. New friends. [Beeping] Yeah! [Crashing] Vamanos! You feeling a little dizzy? Just a little head rush. Well, you know, that was a pretty bad whack you took. Yeah. I wish you'd stay the night, champ. Ah, I'll be all right. I've had worse. You better go hide that puppy. Mr. Laracco? You know where I got that? From that nice kid downstairs. You are aware that our champion has the fight of his career come September? Can't make odds on a fight for the world champion because some washed-up, punk security guard knocks him coo-coo in a hotel room. I'm sorry, Mr. Laracco, i-- oh, he's sorry, Anna. He's killing me, and he's sorry. The fight's cancelled, Freddie. You just cost me a lot of money. Mr. Laracco, I'll find a way to fix everything. You'll do exactly as I say, Freddie. 'Cause if you don't... [Laughing] What's up, fool? To sissy to hold up a trash can? Yo, what's with the dress? It ain't no dress, it's an apron. You're supposed to be out here slinging with me. I'm busy. You a fool. You's a dead fool. I'm done. Can I go? Uh, no. [Puppy whimpering] What's that? I don't know, what is it? [Puppy barking] Mack is our new mascot. ♪ Father who art in heaven. ♪ Thy kingdom come, thy will ♪ be done on earth ♪ as it is in heaven. ♪ Thy kingdom come, ♪ thy will be done on earth ♪ as it is in heaven. ♪ On earth as it is ♪ in heaven. ♪ On earth as it is-- before you leave here tonight, I just want to remind you that god does have a perfect will for your life, and he understands the desires of your heart because he put those desires there. But we have to have Patience, and that's the tough part. So I'm gonna ask you to do this one little thing before we leave. I'm gonna ask you to grab hands with the person next to you, very quickly. We're gonna have a word of prayer. Just bow your heads, heavenly father, we thank you for tonight, for watching over US and for changing your lives and watching over US as we go home. In Jesus' name, and everybody said, "amen." You are dismissed. Mrs. Hererra. Hi. So good to see you again. I'm here to pick up my son. That was very nice. Mrs. Hererra. Allia. Allia. This is Alfredo, my brother, better known as Freddie. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry to interrupt. Do you mind if I have a word with my brother? I'll be with you in a minute. Oh, no, no, please. I just need to get my son home. Nice to meet you. Yeah, nice to meet you too. See you upstairs. Yeah, I'll be there. We have coffee and cookies and cake and stuff. I'll be right back, just be a minute. Um, okay. Hello, little brother. So what brings you to church? I'm here to make your dream come true. Really? Orlando Leone, he was the champ once. Keshon banks, he is the champ now. Out of my way, chump. Or is he? You read about it in the papers, now see these champion gladiators as they face-off for the cruiserweight title of the world. Orlando, the preacher, Leone, versus keshon, the butcher, banks. It's the Saint versus the sinner at the olympic auditorium on September 7th. Judgment day falls. And so will he. What are you doing, Freddie? Here's the deed to your dream. Where'd you get this? I bought it from edland. It's yours free and clear. All you gotta do is show up September 7th and the building's yours. I also got you $1 million guaranteed up front with odds at 20 to 1. I'm not a fighter. I must be in the wrong place. You're not a fighter. Golden gloves, Olympics, ten years as a pro, you're not a fighter. Wake up, Orlando. This--this is what you do. This is who you are. Not anymore. Orlando, that lucky punch that you threw at keshon destroyed the odds on our fight. We had to cancel it. It left US with an open slot and--well, guess who's gonna fill the slot? If I don't do this fight, you gonna take that building from me? Is that what it is, Freddie? Why do you always have to make it sound like I'm a bad guy? Get out of here. Get out of here. Budha, it's all right. Budha, wait outside. I want to talk to my brother. You know, I come here to do something for you to help you out. The least you could do is show a little gratitude. This is garbage, edland would never sell me out. Edland didn't sell you out, I bought you out. And who are you to talk about selling out? Did you really think that I would ever take a dive in a championship fight? You would have had another shot in six months for twice the money. You sold me out. You sold out the family, you sold out the ministry. We're talking about boxing here. We're not talking about some Sunday school outing here, all right? You don't say no to laracco, he says you go down, you go down. And I'll tell you something else, the only reason that you're alive today is because of me. Get out of here. You really hate me, don't you? I pity you. You pity me? Well, that's interesting 'cause I'm not behind in payments. That's your dream. It's not mine. I'll tell you something, you don't go into the ring on September 7th, I'm selling the dream to the highest bidder. It's all about the money, isn't it? That's what that's about. That is about honoring papa. Yeah, well we'll see what bank is gonna honor your righteousness as collateral. You'll call me. Excuse me, sir. We can't find Caesar. All right. When did you last see him? He was here earlier before the service. I left my son here with you, where is he? He's not in the building. I looked for him everywhere. I even checked the parking lot. Have you checked your home? Orlando, maybe we should call the police. Give me the keys to the truck. Where are you going? I'm gonna go find Caesar. I'm going with you. What about the boy's father? You think he could be with him? No. How about at your work? Why are you asking all these questions? He's not allowed around the restaurant anymore, okay? Just find my little boy, please. Hey! Have you seen Caesar? He's my son. Have you seen him? Little punk. Why are you stopping? Look, there's your boy. Caesar! Oh. Oy, I was so worried. Goldie got out. I had to go find her. Why do you always have to worry for? Thank you for helping. You're very welcome. Caesar's father was the youth leader of the church. He's back in Florida somewhere. Caesar has never met him. Mmm. When I told his father I was pregnant, he freaked out and left the youth group and everything. Nice guy. Yeah. That's what I thought. I was 15 at the time. Then when Caesar was born, I mailed his father a picture. He sent it back and told me never to contact him again. After that, I wanted nothing to do with the church. I still very much believe. I just need some time. So I've been sitting here rambling and too much information. I'm sorry. Oh, no. I'm enjoying this. So, what about you, Mr. Orlando Leone, preacher, boxer extraordinaire. Where's your wife and ten children? I think when I was fighting, I just put my all heart and passion into that. Then when this youth center came up, I put my heart and passion into that. So far, so good. So far. Aren't you supposed to come around and open my door or something like that? Something like that. I haven't kissed anybody in a long time. Then we should practice. [Puppy whimpering] What are you looking at? [Puppy whimpering] [Engine revving] We've been looking for you, homes. How you feeling today, partner, huh? You don't look so hot. Don't act like you don't know what's up, homes. Get over here, ese. Venga! Where's my pistola? Donde esta mi drugas? You saw that preacher with the drugs. He took li'l drae's gun too. No, no, no, no, no. It was your piece and your drugs. Now that's $400 for the glock, $75 for the crack, plus $50 a day interest. That's $575 you owe me, ese. Start working it off. Do you know this used to be a hospital? But this was papa's dream. This is what he wanted to do. He wanted to build a place where people could get saved and also have a place to live until they get their lives put back together. So what do you think? Well, I think it's a long time for a building like this to be empty. Yeah, it won't be much longer. I'm sorry, but from what you've told me, I don't know how you're gonna do it. Allia, it's faith. That's how I live. That's what got all this in the first place. Faith plus $3 million you earned in the ring, you invested your retirement and your security for a building that now can be taken away from you in 30 days. Sorry, I think I'm beginning to understand why you never committed to anyone. Gotta go. Allia, what did you mean by what you said back there? I care about you. Estoy UN poca loca. But I just don't want to end up like this building. Hey, Johnny. Hey, what's up, man? I gotta talk to you. Yeah. I know this is gonna sound crazy. I'm gonna fight banks for the belt. Oh, keshon banks? Yeah, what you been smoking, man? No, straight up. I am fighting keshon banks for the championship belt, September 7th, olympic auditorium. Yeah, so it's true, huh? You really did knock him out? He was drunk. September 7th? Are you crazy, man? A little bit. Yeah, well I hope they pay you some serious change for that, man. Who's your trainer gonna be? You. It's being called the fight of the decade, payback for keshon banks' first unofficial loss back in a hotel room last month to a security guard. But not just any security guard, it was Orlando Leone, who surprised the boxing world when he took out the champ with one punch. Gentlemen, thank you for coming. Orlando Leone has challenged our champion, and we have accepted. On September 7th, keshon banks will step into the ring and he will, once again, show the world why, pound-for-pound, he is the greatest fighter in the world. Keshon, what's your prediction for the fight? Total destruction. Yours or Leone's? You think I'm playing? [Rock music] When I get done with him, even god wouldn't recognize him. Any other questions? [Rock music] [Rock music] You're gonna fight the champion of the world September 7th, right? That's right. So the shape you're in now is, basically, the shape you're gonna be in come fight night, so relax. It's not exactly a comforting thought. Orlando, come on, man. You kept yourself in great shape. You're over here every day. There's not a guy in here that can lay a glove on you. I'm not fighting any of these guys. I'm fighting killer keshon banks, the who knows what from who knows where. You were champion of the world, right? Well, you know how when you're the champion, everything you do, every minute of the day has to do with being the champ. Well, with keshon banks, it ain't exactly like that, now is it? Where you going with this? Where I'm going with this, my brother, is that dude is out with the ladies, partying all night, drinking gin and juice. Now that don't make him an unworthy opponent, it just gives you a better shot at not getting killed. You have a good day. Hi, allia. Hi Johnny. You're serious about this fight? Yeah, dead serious. [Skillet "best kept secret"] ♪ You're the hope over the centuries. ♪ ♪ You're the cosmic force that rules the galaxies. ♪ ♪ You're the evidence that demands our belief. ♪ ♪ And I can't live for myself. ♪ ♪ I can't keep this all to myself, yeah yeah. ♪ ♪ You're the best kept secret in my generation. ♪ ♪ The best kept secret of all time. ♪ ♪ You're the best kept secret in my generation. ♪ ♪ And I found you out. ♪ You used to be the boxing champion of the whole wide world, Orlando. That was ten years. Well, isn't it like riding a bike or swimming, once you know how, you don't forget? When a fighter gets older, certain things happen to their body, like, um, the first thing that goes is your legs, which means you don't have the ability to get yourself out of danger. And the next thing that happens is you lose your speed, which means, for a boxer, your speed is everything, so you throw a punch, and you're trying to hit something but their head keeps moving. So every punch you throw, you keep missing, you keep missing. And then the worse thing happens is you lose your reflexes. You see a punch coming, and you can't get out of the way. That's when people get hurt. But the thing that makes the difference is the kill factor. It's the part of you that has that killer instinct that says, "I'm gonna go in there, and i'm gonna tear this guy's head off." It's been ten years. And I don't know if I can get that back. Then don't fight. You want to tell me what's going on with you and your brother? It's an opportunity. The minute that I step into the ring, all of papa's dreams get fulfilled. We'll have enough money to pay for the whole thing, even renovate the whole place, all of it. And you and Freddie are on the same page? Yes, 100%. Mr. Laracco, Mrs. Laracco. Hello, Freddie. Aren't you hot in that black suit? I'm fine. I'm fine. Freddie, my man. We have an announcement to make. Your brother, Orlando Leone, is gonna be our next cruiserweight champion of the world. Ha, does keshon know this? I don't think so. You haven't told him yet. With all due respect, sir. Keshon banks, at this point would like nothing better than to knock my brother's head off. It's just not gonna happen, no way. Thank you. Mr. Laracco, if keshon hears he has to take a dive for a security guard, he won't even step in the ring. Good-bye, Freddie. The body, hit the body champ. Come on work your body. One, two combination. Come on. Is he okay? He looks tired. All right, time. That's it, champ. That's it. Touch gloves here we go. All right let's get that head gear off, huh? Mouthpiece. Man, what, is she running this show from now on or what? That's right, vato. Oh, you want to come in here and say that? Well, you know what, well, by the way. You know what? Yes. All right. Come on, bring it on. Okay. You'll see. No, no, no, you'll see, okay? Okay. You got your hair. You will see, all right? You want to put some lipstick on? How about some perfume? Oh. Did you see that? That's it. That's it. Come on, come on. Come on, cover up, champ. What are you doing? Give me your best shot. She's getting the best of you, champ. Cover up. Cover up. It's illegal. Yeah, it's illegal. Man, did you see what she just--? [Smack!] Orlando, don't play around, come on. Orlando? Orlando? Orlando? Orlando? Come on. Orlando? What's the matter? Your brother's fortunate that that blow from the baseball bat didn't kill him. But the trauma did lead to a condition known as radical parkinsonism. Doctor? So we don't waste anymore of your valuable time, please if you would, just tell US what medications Mr. Leone needs, and we'll all go on with our day. I don't think you're hearing me. There is no medication, no treatment for this. If this man takes another blow to the head, he could die. Look, you are playing Russian roulette if you get back in the ring. One good punch and you could be dead before you reach the E.R. Doctor, would you excuse US for a moment please, hmm? Doctor, let me have a word with you please. I'll be in the next room. Thank you. We just want to have a word with my brother, thanks. Mr. Laracco, this doesn't look good. It'll be fine, Freddie. It's gonna be fine. It will be okay, won't it, kid? Oh, yeah. 'Cause I'm not stepping in the ring on Saturday night. The fight's off. No, not off. You are gonna step into the ring on Saturday night. And you are, most certainly, going to fight. I don't think you're hearing me. You are not hearing me. That was a very bad year because of you. Obviously, a very bad year for your father. What are you saying? When you didn't take a dive like you were supposed to, you made me suffer. You make me suffer, I make you suffer. What goes around, comes around. You killed my father? Don't break any bones, budha. We need a clean bill of health for our fighter on Saturday night. Let go. Freddie, do you know anything about this? Mr. Laracco. I tell you what? Why don't we dedicate this fight to your mother. You can do it for mom, can't you, kid? Oh, yeah, mom. Good. I knew we'd have a meeting of the minds. Freddie? Well, are you okay? Oh, yeah. I just gotta remember to keep my left up around you. Ready to go? Yeah, let's go. Want this? Yes. [Rock music] [Rock music] Goldie, no! No! [Honking] [Screeching] No, Goldie! [Tires screeching] Got a nice dog, homes. He don't behave too well though. Give me my dog. No, no, no, no, no. I oughta cap you right now. So what's it gonna be, you or the preacher, ese? Set him up. Hagalo bien. And don't mess up, ese. Welcome to la casa de Maria. I need to talk to allia. Carne asada, Mexican style, wonderful. There's someone here to see you. Excuse me for a second. Okay. Hi. Hi. I need to talk to you. Just for a moment, I promise. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. I didn't hear what you said, what'd you say? Yes, yes, Orlando Leone, I will marry you! [Rock music] What? I don't want you to listen to this garbage. Someone's here to see you. Come on. Hi, Caesar. Why is he here? Well, your mother and I have decided to get married. To each other. Is that okay with you? Honey, what's the matter? I thought you'd be happy. Nothing's the matter. What do you want me to say? I'm sorry. I didn't expect this. I don't think he did either. Let's get to work. Let's get in here. Get the mouthpiece in, huh doc? All right, we got two-minute rounds, guys. Come on, come on. Put some fire in it. Touch gloves and come out now. Come on. All right, here we go. There you go. All right, there you go. All right, come on. Well, hey. How you doing? All right. Wanna talk? Hop in, we'll go for a ride. Meet you down at the wash. All right. [Ominous music] [Ominous music] [Ominous music] [Ominous music] [Ominous music] [Ominous music] Caesar, I've never done anything like this before, I mean, been married. I'm gonna need some help too. [Ominous music] Is there anything you want to ask me? Anything you're concerned about? Watch out! [Shots firing] [Shots firing] What's going on? [Shots firing] [Shots firing] [Thrilling music] [Thrilling music] [Shots firing] [Thrilling music] [Crashing] [Boom!] Stay in the car. Stay back! [Boom!] I'm sorry. It's okay. [Somber music] [Somber music] [Somber music] [Somber music] [Somber music] [Somber music] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to one of the most off-the-wall matchups we've seen in quite a while. Well, Steve that certainly is true because up until last month, tonight's card was supposed to be keshon banks against Juan Carlos, as you know. But when it became publicized that Orlando Leone, a former champ working as a security guard, knocked out banks with one punch, things changed rather quickly. Lord, we pray you give Orlando the strength of a Samson, the courage of Caleb, and the heart of David. Lord, protect this warrior as he lays it on the line for you tonight. In your name, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hi. Hi. We just want to tell you we love you. I love you. I love you. Now, I want you to do something for me. I want you to take care of this. Make sure nobody steals it. I'll see you when it's over. Okay. Take care. Take care. [Inaudible] May I? Nervous? A bullfight, huh? Moment of truth. You always fought for what was right, like pop. I always respected that, hated you for it too. There are times that i--i hated pop too. But in my own way, I loved him as much as you did. And I never would have done anything to deliberately hurt him. And by the way, third round, champ's gonna take a fall. I know you'll do the right thing, you always have. Take care out there, champ. I ain't goin' out for no security guard! I ain't gonna do it! You're not gonna do what, keshon? I ain't taking no dive! You know, three years ago, you were roaming the streets, picking up old ladies and beating them up for chump change. I took you in. I gave you a place to live. I created you. I said, I created you. That means when your head hits the canvas tonight, and it will hit that canvas tonight, my young friend, in the third round. You'll be free falling into a comforter stuffed with $5 million. Couple of months in Vegas, kicking back with the ladies, you won't even remember this night. Make myself clear? Yeah. Excuse me? Yeah, I understand what you saying! Then make it look good, seamless. Oh, by the way, preacher's got a brain problem. Don't hit him in the head. What? Have a good fight, champ. Oh, Lee, it's me. Listen, I want to place a million. You heard me, just do it, all right? [Bell ringing] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's main event. The title fight for the cruiserweight championship of the world! Come on, ma. What an incredible atmosphere here in this packed arena tonight. Give it up for Orlando, the preacher, Leone, Jr.! Let's go. And here comes the challenger. [Skillet "best kept secret"] ♪ You're the best kept secret in my generation. ♪ ♪ The best kept secret of all time. ♪ ♪ You're the best kept secret in my generation. ♪ ♪ The best kept secret of all time. ♪ Remember Leone hasn't boxed in a professional bout in ten years. Well, that obviously doesn't seem to bother this crowd. This darn place is on fire. And it's gonna get even hotter. Here's your champion, keshon, the butcher, banks! [Rock music] Coming in with his usual swagger. I tell you the crowd absolutely loves this guy, always brimming with confidence. [Rock music] And now banks and Leone go face-to-face. Look at the way they're circling each other, taunting as the mind games begins. And look how banks shoves Leone. And this fight could break out earlier than planned. Let's go up to ring announcer, Gary burman, for the official introduction. In the red corner, the former w.B.A. Cruiserweight champion and olympic bronze medallist, from Los Angeles, California, Orlando, the preacher, Leone! And in the blue corner weighing 190 pounds of unrelenting destruction, from Las Vegas, Nevada with a record of 23 wins, 21 knockouts, the undefeated, undisputed, cruiserweight champion of the world, keshon, the butcher, banks! Gentlemen, you both know the rules. I want a good, clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Touch 'em up. Let's rock and roll! There you have the final instructions as both fighters seem eager to get this showdown started, we get set for the opening round. It's all you, brother, go get it! [Bell rings] [Crowd cheering] [Crowd cheering] And it's Leone who throws the first punch, a--jab easily blocked by banks. And once again, it's the challenger, Leone, looking to dictate the fight here at the outset as he presses the attack, looking to be the aggressor. There you go. Come on! But wait, banks able to spin Leone around and the challenger finally gets his wake-up call. Leone grabs banks and ties him up. Leone with a gorgeous double left hook. [Bell rings] [Crowd booing] The crowd isn't very happy with keshon's performance here in the first round. And I have to say, bill, that I agree with them. Leone, on the other hand, looks sharper after ten years than I thought possible. How you feeling, champ, huh? Good. Yeah. Well as we get ready to start round two, we'll see if keshon's trainers have figured out what the problem is. [Bell rings] Box. Come on, man. Come on, champ. Let's see what you got. What is Leone doing? You want me, here I am. Come on, man. Come on, man. What are you doing? You the champ. Get your hands up! Cover your face! Leone's not being too wise here. He shouldn't be lowering his hands like that. Get out of the corner! Once again, keshon blows a good opportunity as Leone spins out of the corner. I don't know if I like the looks of what this fight is turning into. Come here, you. I don't know what's going on in this ring, but I don't want any more of it. You know the rules. I want a boxing match. Box! Whoa! What a blistering assault by banks! He suddenly has Leone reeling. [Bell rings] Break! Get in your corner. It just shows the kind of explosive power he can demonstrate. When he actually wants to turn it on, he really can turn it on. What are you doing out there, huh? Don't be acting cocky! Cocky gets you hurt! This kid's young, you're not. I ain't trying to hit him. I'm tired of holding this bum up. This is your round! This is round three! All right. Let's go. [Bell rings] Well, there's no fooling around this round as Leone dashes out and attacks banks with a quick combination of punches. Left right, left right. Oh, what an upper cut by Leone followed by a big left hook. The champ is down! One! Two! That's it? A body shot and you're down? You wanted me, fight me! Fight me now! Come on! The crowd goes wild as keshon suddenly rises to his feet. Nailed Leone with four, straight, big, right hands. You're a dead man, keshon! You're dead! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! You okay? Yeah. You want to fight? Oh, yeah. Finally this is turning into a fight. Unbelievable. Keshon charges in and head butts him. I don't know if that was an accident. Keshon is on a rampage. [Bell rings] There's the bell signaling the end of round three. You're a boxer. I want you to box, all right? Mr. Laracco, I think you better get the [bleep] out of here. Give him some water, give him some water. Listen, listen, listen, listen! You want to win this? You gotta wear him out. Come on, now. You gotta wear him out. Are you all right? Talk to me, talk to me! Left to the body, take it upstairs. Huh? You knock him down. [Bell rings] [Muffled cheering] [Muffled cheering] [Muffled cheering] Box! It's round four as both come out with fire in their eyes. Leone crumbles to the canvas, down for the second time. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! You all right? Box! Banks playing to the crowd and motions to Leone, is that all you got? Banks pummeling Leone in the corner. Get out of the corner! Let's go, Orlando! [Cheering] [Cheering] Leone is doing more than holding his own, he's giving the champ a run for his money. Left hook from Leone and banks goes crashing down! Fight? Go on? Okay. Box! [Heart beating] [Heart beating] Go to your corner! One! Get up! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! You okay? You gonna fight? Yeah! All right. Yeah! Yeah, come on! Come on right here! Over here! Get him! [Grunting] [Grunting] Yes! Go baby! There you go! There you go, yeah! Yeah, baby, yeah! That's it. That's it. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! It's over!
