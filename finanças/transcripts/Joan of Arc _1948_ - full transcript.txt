And so by disposition of the divine mercy, it was done most opportunely, that Joan, child of god, daughter of France, today be placed among the number of the saints. Saint Joan of Arc whose history is recorded here, lived only 19 years on this earth. She was born in 1412 in a village of Domrémy, on the marche of Lorraine. At the time when France, losing the hundred years war, was overrun by her enemies, her cities ruined, her farms stripped bare, her people hopeless. But the enemies of France did not reckon on the girl Joan praying in the little ruined church of her village. As she knelt there, the voices of her saint spoke to her again and again, urging her to become a soldier, to lead the armies of France to victory. to crown the Dauphin at Rheims, Impossible things they asked of her... ...and asked again. What a pity... ...a pity that it is the Kingdom of France. Jeanette? Jeanette! Jeanette, your ride is here, we are to give him breakfast. See to it. What ails you girl? Why you always alone and listen to no one and answer as if you were in a dream? It's well to love your church, burnt though it is, but to think of nothing else, to look at me without seeing me, to forget your friends and keep all of this to yourself, this cannot be good! You've become a strange girl, Jeanette. I don't trust you! I can't trust you! Go and make breakfast. From where I was hiding I could watch them, I could see 'em looting, burning, murdering... They burned everything in their path. But uncle, were the soldiers English or Burgundians? Burgundians! About 60 of 'em, mounted, and armed. Burgundians or English, they leave the same trail. I can't understand the Burgundians! French killing French! They're deceiving their own people! Oh, it's not only the Burgundians that betray us, Durand. Our last king promised us to the English before he died. Queen mother sold us out for English gold. Our lords are fighting among each other. Young Charles, our King, fine prince, our Dauphin, whatever you call him, he's too weak to keep order and too poor to pay his debts. I..I saw Reboux at the market. He lost an arm in the fighting at Orleans. Oh, poor Reboux! - They may take Orleans. - They will take it! They've surrounded our last great city. Folk within the wall have nothing but their despair and their hunger. There's no hope for relief and they can't hold out much longer. If Orleans falls it means the end of France. Well, I want to be home before my wife hears word of the raid! We could pick you up at the site, we're going down to the Palo Vien Keep your hands busy and keep your mind on what's going on about you. Well, thank you Isabel. Thank you! Goodbye Jide Don't mind it, Jeannette. We know you're a good and gentle girl but there's a dreamy haze about you. Makes him moody and angry. A...a dream? He dreamed you went away with soldiers. With an army. First he though that you'd been carried away, then it seemed that you went of your own free will. He dreamed I went away with an army He's dreamed it more than once. He told us too, John and me. He said he'd drown you in the River Meuse before a thing like that should happen, and if he were not here, he charged us to do it. Here. Dear sweet God, have pity on me! Help me in this trouble! It's more than four years since I first heard the voices, in my father's garden, again and again your Saints told me that I must go. But how? How can I save France? How can I, lead the Dauphin to his coronation? Can I? I'm only a poor girl of the farms. I've never seen a King or an army. I'm not fitted to speak to great people. or go among them. All this time I have...I have tried, to make a beginning but I can find no way so nothing is done. I know that everyday now we lose France, I still don't know how to go about what is asked of me. So I do nothing! Forgive me, forgive me! I am helpless and in anguish. Will a voice come and say that I am forgiven? For I have tried with all my soul, I have tried. Then I must go, and do what I can, without knowing how. Uncle Durand! Uncle Durand! Uncle Durand! - Jeannette, did I forget something? - No, only uncle Durand I must go to Vaucouleurs, take me with you. - To Vaucouleurs? - Yes. Your father said nothing about this to me. Your mother said nothing about it. No. Well this is very strange, Jeannette. You want to buy something in the city? I have to speak to Sir Robert de Baudricourt. What about? Why would you speak to the King's captain? - I can't tell you Uncle Durand. - Then I can't take you. I shall walk then. Even if I wear my legs to the knees, I must go. It may be that I do wrong... but come. - Next. - Gerard Morseau, Sir Robert. - Morseau, you are late for the taxes. - Uh they burned my house, Sir Robert. - Stole my grain. - Give him till next harvest. Durand Lassois, - Taxes for your village are not due yet. - I know, Sir Robert. - This is uh... this is my niece. - Hm. - She is the daughter of Jacques d'Arc of Domrémy. - Yes, yes. She wishes to speak with you. I... I... Yes, yes, go on girl, go speak up. Tell me. I... I bring you a message Sir Robert. You must send me to the Dauphin. My lord commands it. Your lord? I am your lord! - My Lord is the King of Heaven. - Hm, that's a point. That's a point. But I am to lead the Dauphin's armies. To lead his armies? When did the Dauphin have an army? And women don't lead armies girl, they follow! And if you want to become that, a camp followerette can be arranged. - But I'm to save France. - To save France? Go home girl and don't be an idiot! If it would have been possible to save France, it would have been done long ago. We would have done it ourselves, eh Burnitz? But the war will change! When I come to the aid of the Dauphin, I... I must lead him to his coronation! Maxar, take this Mooney girl home, and tell her father to box her ears. But you must send me to the Dauphin, I must save France! I am sorry, Sir Robert. I didn't know what she is going to say. I'll take her home. - What a fool you made out of me, if I've known what you are going to say... - I didn't want to bring this on you uncle Durand, but there was no other way. - And I had to speak to him. - You had to? Your father will never forgive me. - Never in the world! - Hush, hush cousin. Make way! Attention! Make way! Jeannette! No, Jeannette, come back! - Sir Robert has spoken! - Sir Robert! Sir Robert, you must send me out to take part in the war! Orleans is in great danger, and even today a battle is raging. What? Orleans is 200 leagues from here, nobody knows what's going on there. Sir Robert! Sir Robert! Jeannette! I tell that there is fighting this very day and it goes against us! You must listen! You must hear me! Child, we all want to save France, but France has dwindled down to a tiny patch without a King, where they need a champion and there's no saving it! Go home! Go home to your father, child. Don't mean to spare me. Those are very strange things you say girl. Yes, they are strange. I'm sent here to speak to Sir Robert, but you saw that he cares neither for me nor for my words. Nevertheless before the middle of Lent I must be with the Dauphin. Believe me I'd rather go home and spin with my mother. For this is not my proper place. But there is not one person in the world, not among Kings, or nobles, or princes who can bring help to the France we love. Not once save this maid you see before you. It's not because of anything in me, but because the King of heaven wishes it so. Have you heard of a prophecy? There is a prophecy that a maid from Lorraine will save France. - Have you heard it? - No, I know nothing of a prophecy. We attack now, wench? She'll have a battle with her father. - She speaks the truth! - Jeannette, come to me! - You must go home1 - Our Saviour. - That to crown our king! In a neck red dress! Bide you I wouldn't know how to speak. But still...year after year, I was told that I must go, I must save Orleans and drive the English from French soil. Do your parents know of this, Jeannette? No. I have told no one. Not that I was asked to keep silent, but I knew my father would forbid me to go What are we to do? I know that you have to go back uncle but I must stay until Sir Robert will listen to me. You must stay? Yes, I must! I'll stand at his gates until he passes and if there is no room for me, I'll sleep in the fields. What I am commanded to do. I do! Leave her here with me, Durand. I'll take care of her. What if I meet your father? Must you tell him you brought me here? You're safe enough here and I can leave you but... But what, uncle? No good will come of it. I won't say nothing good of it. Why are you here again? You know Sir Robert won't see you. Go home girl and don't come back tomorrow. That's she, coming now. - Forgive me, but are you the maid? - I'm Joan, daughter of Jacques d'Arc. - We heard about you in Lille, we wanted to see you. - And to tell you that we believe in you, we prayed for you. We held a mass for you last Sunday. Thank you. I know that your prayers will help. The gates were locked in my face again. Mother. I came to take you home, Jeannette. You must come home, Jeannette. A dark dream has crept over you for a little while, but its done no harm, and soon it will be gone and when it's gone no one will think of it. But come home. I never wanted to hurt you, mother. For I love you more than anyone else in the world. But if I had a 100 fathers and a 100 mothers, I... I could not go back. I must go forward now. Then tell me where, Jeannette? Toward what would you go? - Where's the girl? - Sir Robert. That's the one. Exactly 2 weeks ago you came to see me and spoke of a battle. Today a courier came with messages. There was indeed a great battle on that day. And a heavy defeat for the Dauphin. How did you learn this? Have you studied witchcraft? - Oh surely you know I have not. - That is just what we do not know. Father Fournier, put her to question. If you are a thing of evil and sent from Satan, depart from us. but if you are good and from God, come near. I ask your blessing, father. And I ask of whatever is evil fly far from you. Whatever is good remain to help our cause and the cause of France. She is no sorcerer, Sir Robert. Whatever you have heard her say, whether prophecy or not, the devil has no part in it. Thank you, father. - You still wish to go to the Dauphin. - My Lord has commanded me to go. These 2 gentlemen wish me to send you forth on this wild mission of yours, they are willing to ride with you as escort. To me it seems like a fool's errand, but they believe you may help our country. Now if there is a chance of that, I don't want to put anything in the way. Then it shall all come true. Goodbye, my child. Ever since I heard you speak, I've gone about in a kind of dream. For I've never yet seen clearly where I must go, or what I must do with my life. But suddenly, when I heard your voice, it seemed to me that I knew. I come to be your follower. Thank you. You are the first. And I'm quite willing to be the second. When do we set out? Today rather than tomorrow. Tomorrow rather than the day after. The Dauphin is at Chinon. That's a long way through enemy country. So prepare yourself for a rough and dangerous winter ride. Fetch me a...boy's clothing. I'll dress as a man. If this is wrong, then I'll always know it was wrong. No, mother. I was born for this. Jeannette, the town folk have brought you a horse for your journey. There, it's finished. Why you...you, you make a handsome lad! I've sent a messenger ahead with my letter to the Dauphin so they'll expect you. Joan, have you ridden before? By the time we reach Chinon I should ride well. Take care that you ride only by night, the news of your coming will run ahead like fire and the enemy will want to watch for you. I fear them not. No sword? Here, take mine. A mother bears children and gives them to the world and she thinks she knows them well. But she doesn't know them at all. And now you must go. Guard her well. You have many leagues to ride and icy rivers to cross. Go to the shrine of redeemer, mother, and pray for us. - Goodbye! - God be with you! - Godspeed, Joan, come back soon! - Goodbye, Joan! - God help you Joan. - Thank you! Go then maid of Lorraine, I expect but little of you, but go... and come what may. Farewell, Joan! - Goodbye! - Farewell, Joan! Well, tell us who you are! Travellers, my friend, just travellers. - And who may you be? - I'm the head constable of Clairevaux. We're honest men. You may be, but I must look at you. Are you a lad? - Let me tell you why we meet you here. - Well, tell us and let us go on. There is a party of Burgundian soldiers in our town. They say that they're here to lay hands on the maid from Lorraine, the one that is coming to help the Dauphin. If one of you should be that maid, - Then go round our village. - Thank you, constable. This does not concern us. My wife send two loaves of bread. - That was the best we could do. - Thank you again. I would like to if you would permit me to lay them in the hands of the lad myself. If it should be that you're the maid from Lorraine, I don't say that you are, but if it should be, I have a message for you from the people of Clairevaux. It's this: "God go with you." "God go with you and save France and save us too." Now we can go to our homes, neighbours, for we've seen her and we've given her the warning. Those are the towers of Chinon. Oh we've come through safely. We're here. To Chinon we tried...it has all been worthwhile... ...and I shall see my daughter. - Did you bring the gold Trémouille? - Gold? Gold? No, I did not. You should bow when you come into the presence, Duke. Your attitude is... slovenly. - You owe me money. - Money? I have definite information that you plan to abandon your kingdom. You're leaving us. You're deserting us. If I lent you 3,000 crowns, you'd disappear to the North or the South and I can whistle for my money. Not only this loan in question but the enormous sums you already owe me. Then lend me a thousand. It's safe, I can't go very far on that. I'll need your signature. I refuse to sign until I have the money. I'll need your signature first. - Lackey, a quill for my Lord. - You robber! You thief! You brigand! Gentlemen, not before the court. Before he lends me money he demands my signature at the bottom of a blank page, and I know why. Every time I borrow from him he uses my signature to sell some of my territory to Burgundy to raise the money he lends me. That's not true. But that's incredible my lord! That would be dishonest! Well, not by his standards! It's sound business practice. I'm already so deep in debt to him that I have to borrow money from him to pay the interest on what I owe him! Let us be fair, my sovereign. If Trémouille charges you more interest than is customary, he may be pardoned on the grounds that you are very unlikely to come to your throne. And if you don't he'll never be paid, principal or interest. Your own mother has said... Who believes what my mother says? ...has said you're not the son of the last King and - the history of her amores would seem to substantiate... - Enough about my mother. Well, you intend going over to the English too, don't you archbishop? No, I know. You are on both sides, both of you, unless I mind everyday because I'm going down and you think the time has come to... let go and let me drown? But...hold it! I'm surrounded by thieves. Not thieves, my lord. These men steal kingdoms, that makes them statesmen. And you're slighting me too... look at the entertainment you provide. Tumblers! Your majesty will forgive me when he sees the next attraction. What is it? Does your majesty remember the poor, mad maid from Lorraine? No... Do I? The one Baudricourt wrote you about. She's been waiting at the inn, hoping to see you. Well, let her wait. She's here now. She's on the threshold... I promise you, if you lend me your throne for a moment I'll lay the whole court flat with laughter... and it will cost you nothing. Very well. Marty, my cousin, so happy to have you here, No, no, no. Sit with us and watch the entertainment. I have been watching Charles but I couldn't believe my eyes. Gaiety, frivolity, waste... and a few leagues from here Orleans, your last great city is dying, and you let it die. Your kingdom slips from you and you look the other way. No more, Alençon, no more if you love me. If I love you, I must say more I've heard you're leaving us Charles, that you plan to abandon France But you're the heart of France. What have we left if you go? And what does France mean to me? a mad father who signed away my rights for the treaty, a mother who has declared me illegitimate. a sister who married the only King and now is mother to the pretender to my throne. Do you wonder if I amuse myself? I can't watch it. My lord and fellow reprobates, we now come to the final foolery of the evening! The last and the best. - When you know what it is... - Are you to do dancers? - A play! It's better than a play. A prophetess has come from Lorraine. Promising to save France and crown our Dauphin. Now then, the game is we put the Count of Clermont on the throne, he will pretend that he is the illustrious Charles. When the evening is over, I shall be Dauphin by popular demand, huh? Fortunately, that is not enough. - Now, sit on the throne. - Please, a little obeisance, my good people. That's better. Now, let her enter. Let her enter, I say. Ah... there are three of you. And which may I ask is the maid of Lorraine? - I am the maid from Lorraine. - Who are these other maidens with you? This is Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy came with me to guard me. A family of three? Sir, if you mean anything against the maid or doubt our respect for her I advise you to watch what you say. My apologies. I'd rather nobody knelt to me. Then nobody will. I assure you, it's not a position one chooses for comfort. But come, here's our great Dauphin. Well, here I sit waiting for the crown you promised me, maid of Lorraine. See that I am crowned. See that I am crowned at once. Here, your Dauphin offers you his hand, maiden. My gentle Dauphin it is you I seek. I've come a long way to find you and no other can take your place. God has spoken to me through his messengers. And it is his will that I come to aid you and that you'll be King of France. How did you know me? I can tell you that when we are alone. - What is your opinion? - This girl is dangerous, there must be a third party. - I could swear she was sent by your enemies. - My Dauphin, I say to you from this hour the war will change. And your life will change. But the truth is, Joan, I'm not the sort of person God would be very likely to be interested in. Truly, I'm not. Though I'm no worse than the others here probably but... God bothers very little with any of us if you should ask me. Now, I've been honest with you. Be honest with me. What is it you want? Money? Lands? Presents? - I'm a poor man in spite of being... - It is not true that God takes no interest in you. You say that to hide yourself from me as you just now hid among the women. But God will find you out. And make you King. This is an honest voice. Listen to her, Charles. I think you've come just in time. For a moment... I thought you were the Dauphin. I'm his cousin, the Duke of Ronson. I'm glad you're here, good Duke. The more we gather of the royal blood of France, - the stronger is our cause. - Don't trust her my Lord. I'm trying not to trust her. But every time I looked into her eyes, - I believe what she says is true. - More reason to distrust her. Gentle Dauphin, if I tell you things so secret that they are known to you and God alone, will you believe that I am sent by him? Come with me, Joan. Nicholas, unhitch from the plough! Bring your horse! Come and join the maid's army! Maid? She has no army! - Then she will soon have one! - Come along, Nicholas! - Come along! - Join us! Men come flocking by the thousands. The maid's name is magic. - My people believe in that. - Nobody holds back? Why? Why? Why? The army gathered. Men are coming from everywhere. Gold and jewels are dug from the ground and poured into the treasury. Grain and cattle you couldn't buy are sent as gifts. You ordered us to raise the army, we've done it. But you still haven't given us the word to march. But I couldn't very well before the girl had been examined by the archbishop and the officers of the church. But the examination has finished. 20 learned and loyal priests questioned her for 3 weeks at Poitiers. They sent to Domrémy and Vaucouleurs for all the available evidence about her. The church finds Joan untouched, religious and pure at heart, - and says so formally. - Yes. Although we find nothing except good in her, still we are not certain if it's wise to send her into battle. At present you are at least alive, Dauphin, but if you throw yourself into this war you may lose not only your kingdom, but your life. I'm not going to lead the army. She's going to lead it. A green country girl leading an army of France? You will be the laughing stock of Christendom. I've been that for a long time. Thanks to you... and you. For years you've tried to convince me that I'm a pretender to my father's throne. A scoundrel, an imbecile. At times I've been inclined to believe you. But then she came... and sort me out. What did she tell you in the chapel? I can't tell you that. And I won't. You'll tell us. You've never kept a secret in your life. I shall keep this one. The truth is I don't yet know what I want to do. It's my own head, mind you. My own head and my crown. I don't know whether I want to risk them. But how long are we to wait? Are we never to relieve Orleans. I don't know. I don't know. The longer you wait the wiser, your Majesty. I'm not sure of that either. - Your majesty, I... - My Dauphin, forgive my bad manners. For days I've tried to see you but the guard said no, you were in council... My dear Joan, that cloak becomes you, you look radiant! I thank you for it, my Dauphin, all preparations are made. Let us have action. Men of action and not men of words! Send me to Orleans, and the sign you asked for will be given. - Now is the time. - There is always time, Joan. No, there is not always time, my Dauphin. Use me well, for I've told you I shall last a year and but a little longer. Come ride with us to Orleans. If you wish me to say yes, you must not ask for unreasonable things. You must not ask me to lead an army. I warn you again, your Majesty. It's not common sense to trust this girl. If it be God's will to deliver Orleans, Why do you need soldiers? The soldiers will fight and God will give them victory. If I could be sure... You see it's myself that I'm not sure of. - I'm not sure I would make a good King. - What you need is faith in God. When you have that you'll have faith in yourself. I'm not sure God wants me to be King. Why should God send me help, when I am... what I am? Put aside your doubts and fears, my Dauphin. Be noble as I have dreamed you to be, be as God requires you to be, be as France needs you. Your France, your nation and your people, so helpless without you, but unconquerable as soon as you turn your trust to God. - Can you look at her face and doubt, my Lord? - No. I do not doubt now. Alençon, take her to the captains. God is with this girl, and will be with her in battle. Does the armour feel heavy to you? No. I am light and light-hearted, for I shall meet the army and begin. Hold my banner high, Velon! Gentlemen, I present you Joan the maid. This is Antel, Couvert, Poulon, Derrogaux, Serseraille, and this is Laire. Hah! By the wild bull of Bijon! It's a girl... and in harness! Hahaha! Laire takes pride in being a plain blunt fellow without polish for anybody, so think nothing of his greeting. He fights well. If he fights well, I shall like him. That is not the question Well, come sit with us Joan. We shall all be working together and we must become acquainted. Was it my friend Baudricourt who sent you to the Dauphin? Yes! How did he ever come to believe in you? I don't think he ever believed in me, sir. Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy believed in me, and he sent me because of them I think. In the history of France or the world I remember no name built up with such suddenness. No enthusiasm so wide spread, no career advanced under such favourable auspices. Somebody of really portentous imagination and skill must have cooked this thing up. Oh, what thing? This virgin from Lorraine business. You don't have to keep up appearances with us, you know. Do you know what he means? Yes, I do. You'll find her honest, Serseraille. She's one of two things... Either a charlatan or a fool. As for the first, I can't answer for I don't know what the word means, If I'm a fool, God at least does not held it against me. Joan I promise you, that so long as you don't try to give any commands, we shall all get along well. Oh, I shall not try to give any commands. I wouldn't know what commands to give. By the rock of Moses, that's the first sensible word I heard you say, wench! - You stick to that and by the thunders of God there will be no trouble. - Don't swear, Laire. Don't swear? - Now, by the black rock of... - There must be no swearing in this army among high or low. Do you want to strike the army dumb? - This must begin with you. - You said you would give no order, Joan. Oh, but this is not a military order, sir. Surely you must see that. But the army that is to march on Orleans was raised in a holy cause. I saw the men today, there were women among them, they drank and swore. These things must cease and every man must go to confession before we march. - Before God... - Don't swear, Laire. But if you must, swear by my staff. By my staff? What kind of an oath is that? No army was ever sent to confession. If we gave such orders, we'll be laughed at. - I shall give no such command! - Or any of us, you may be sure of that. By the sores of Lazarus! What war have it's leaders had to sit in council with a green country girl? A pox on this silly Dauphin of ours. Bad enough when he was a plain coward. Now he sends children to lead us. She's not to lead us, you great ox. She's to ride before us as a sort of symbol, a figurehead - for the soldiers to rally around. - No by the love of Janice and all his 2 face Janissaries, she will not rally me around. I don't expect she'll be of much help in battle, - Nevertheless I'm grateful to her. - For what? For giving us another chance. There must be some other way to give an order to a whole army. It's the only one that I know Joan, you gave a general order through the captains, and they refused you. But how can I tell them? How can I do this? I don't know...truly I don't. Father Pascur, what am I to do? I wish I could help for I know you are right, but I don't see how it can be done. Do you play this game often? Every day all day. That takes it all. From now on there won't be much time for games. - It's the maid. - The maid. - The maid... the one we follow. - Is it something we can do perhaps? Yes. Pick up your dice for a moment. Pick up your dice, my friend. They tell me that armies are like this, that all armies are like this and that there is no changing them. Yet we cannot have victory we are not worthy of it. But we came here because you promised victory. It is true that God has called us to the work we are to do, but it is not enough that God is on our side, we must be on his side. What are we to do, maid? There must be no gambling. - No gambling? - No, not even in secret. And you must not swear and take God's name in vain. - What was that? - No swearing the maid said. And you must send away all your women. - What? What's that? - No women. - There must be no camp followers. - She means us. And before we march each man must go to confession and clear his soul of all evil he has done. What does she thinks we are? Monks? - Be quiet, Savion! - Let her speak! Please hear me. As many as can. You see, there is no strength in me. And no strength in my hands. There is no strength in any of our hands great enough to win against the English. Our strength is in our faith. And if our faith is eaten away by little things that God hates then, though there be a million of us, we shall be beaten back and die. Yes, come near! And you men too! And those who cannot hear! Give them this message! We can win only if we become God's army. It is not easy to stand here before you, and ask this of you. Perhaps it will not be easy to do. But I know that if these things are done then though the English hang from the clouds and ride on the whirlwind, we shall beat them. Though their arrows fall like hail from the sky and their spears be a ring of steel and their cannons speak and strike like the thunderstorm from heaven, yet they shall be ours! For this, God has promised. Our father who is in heaven is our leader. He will be with us, while we hallow his name. He will give us all we need. Our daily bread, our victory and the land that is forever free. Why are we on this side of the river if that is Orleans? You've come this way by order of Dunois. - Bastard of Orleans. - He commands here? Yes, girl. That must be he riding out to welcome you. - Greetings Dunois. - Greetings, my Lord. You're most heartedly welcomed, my friends. More so since you bring the maid with you. If that is the city of Orleans, why did you command that we approach by this side of the river? We should have ridden up boldly where the English are strongest. Then you are on the right side of the river, maid. You see those towers? That's The Tourelles, the strongest English fort. We take it, the other forts will crumble. Who commands over Les Tourelles? Sir William Glasdale. He's the pick of the English captains, I've fought him many times. I'm commanded to warn this Englishman, to give up the fort, and to save his life and the lives of his men. Take me to him! Sir William Glasdale! Sir William Glasdale! I am Sir William Glasdale. Who are you? I am Joan, the maid. Sir William Glasdale, and you men of England, who have no right to be in our France, The King of Heaven sends you word by me, to abandon your forts and go back to your own country, Hah! And if you do not do so I shall make such a high, high among you, as will be eternally remembered. I come to tell you this, lest you perish in a lost cause, in an evil war. This is most generous of you, but I wish to remind you of two things, First, we are winning this war, Second, if there is an evil cause, it is your own. Dunois, now hear, you have the devil on your side. We have God on ours! I tell you Sir William it is of you I think, and of the many men who will die! if you do not heed my warning and surrender now! I have never feared sorcery, and I'll take no warning from a harlot! I meant only well to you. Take her out of bow shot Bastard, or one of these archers may put a shaft through your pretty maid and spoil her fun! Come Joan. Salt cow! Common 'orn! Common as the road by which you came. Sapphist! Strumpet! Witch! Eye of Satan! This is the hour. Now is the time. In God's name, strike! Strike boldly! Forward! - Fire! - Fire! - Forward! - Fire! Fire! Fire! Forward! Man the slits! Get those cannoneers! Fire the catapults! Fire! Hurry with the mantlets! Follow the white banner! Forward! For God and our country, forward! Follow the banner! God is with you all, Lords! All! Fire! Break through the walls! Close with them! In God's name, forward! The witch, the witch! Stay there, coward! Forward, my friends, forward! Up and over! France! France! God is your protector! Forward! Forward! Brave men, good soldiers, hurry! On the walls! Archer! Hurry men! Altogether, to the walls! I hit the witch! She's down, she's down! She's down, the witch is down! Victory, England has won! It must come out, Joan. Hold my amulet, maid. It will conjure away your pain. Thank you, my friend. No, no thanks. I'd rather die than use sorcery. I'll cleanse your wound with oil and dress it with lard. Bind me. And I lie here... for a while. Father Pasquerel, do you hear. - The Tourelles has fallen. - No, Joan. That's the note for recall. We've been ordered to retreat. - Help me to my harness. - Child, you are wounded. I don't feel it. No! No, men of France! Do not give up! Courage men, do not fallback! Laire, Dunois, Alençon, turn back! Friends, come with me. We must not give up. We've done all we can this day, Joan, our men are exhausted. - The English are just as exhausted. - We held a council and decided to retreat. You've been with your council and I've been with mine. And I say to you, the council of our Lord is better and stronger than yours. - We need only to go forward and the fort is ours! - If she wants to attack, we attack. When my banner touches the wall - we shall have victory! - Sound the trumpets, forward men! Forward! Follow the banner! On your feet! Do not give up! For the glory of France! To the walls! To the walls! French men, French men! There is no turning back! We shall have victory, God wills it! - To the walls! - To the walls! Scale the ladder! France, rise above! Death to the enemy! Forward men, this is the victory! Resist! Enter boldly, victory shall be ours! God say yield! God say yield! God say yield! Yield to redeem your life! God say yield to redeem your life! I'll never yield to you, sorceress witch! You call me harlot, but I have great pity on your soul and the souls of your men! Yield to the King of heaven! I say never! Not to you, fiend from hell! No, no! Burn in hell! Death by fire is a horrible thing. Joan! Joan, we've been looking for you. Why are you crying? Because they're dead...horribly dead! It was I who killed... Killed who? All these men. Are you crying about the English? I have no hatred for the English. I spoke bold and loud so that you would follow me, I thought victory would be beautiful. - Look at this so ugly and bloody. - Why there was never a more beautiful victory than this. And it's your victory. The whole city is waiting to receive you. - You must lead the army through the streets. - No! No! This blood is on my soul and I won't spend (sobbing)... Joan, you have given faith to the city of Orleans and the people of France. They want to see you. I...(sobbing) Come. Maid of Orleans. Won't you touch my child!? Your touch is better than mine! On to Paris! Jesus Maria... great and honoured prince, Duke of Burgundy I, Joan the maid, beg you as humbly as I can, to put an end to this war between us. for your Burgundy is part of France, and should not fight on the English side. Let us then have a good, firm peace. And to ratify that peace, I urge you to attend the coronation of Charles the 7th in the cathedral of Rheims. Come and take your rightful place at the consecration of...of your royal cousin. And may God keep us ever friends. Written in the said place of Rheims, the 15th day of July in the year of our Lord 1,429. - She speaks well of you! - Very flattering. She addresses me as an equal! Well, she's been taking towns from you consistently, and I must say she's defeated the best of my English captains. By sorcery! By enchantment! Our soldiers see her banner and run away. Her victories will be remembered as the most shameful episode of history. I quite agree with you. Mighty England and great Burgundy, the richest prince in Christendom, beaten by a green country girl. My Lord, did you come to me for aid and advice, I have this to say: Think, Duke. Think carefully before you reject the maid and her invitation to the coronation of your dear cousin. This no moment for jesting, Count of Luxembourg. And no subject for it. The fact remains that tomorrow in the Cathedral of Rheims the maid will crown her dancing master, the Dauphin, King of France. She's victorious and she has made no mistakes so far. If she decides to march on Paris, and no doubt she will, Paris will be lost... and we'll fall. This is a grave moment in the history of Burgundy. - And of England. - And of the church. We had to deal with many heretics, but none as dangerous as this one. The maid a heretic? I thought the church had examined her and found her good, pious and untouched. If I had sat as judge at Poitiers, I can assure you the verdict would have been different. Count Bishop your hatred for the maid is justified. Had she chased me from my castle at an hour's notice I would have called her much worst names... than a heretic. It may be luck for us that she's exactly where she is. - Luck? - She's about to make her first error. Tomorrow she will crown Charles. She should set the crown on her own head. Charles is a fool, a gull, a knave. He sold out to us before. - He may do it again. - You'd offer him money? Not I, you. For a truce. For first time in a 100 years France is victorious, Why in heaven's name should Charles grant us a truce? Dangle gold in front of him and he might take it, he always has. Trémouille is with him as usual. And Trémouille would sell anything. Right my dear Cauchon, and since it's our only chance and our last, you must send a messenger to Rheims at once, and put the offer very high, say 100,000 gold crowns. If we get the truce, we'll have time to fortify Paris. You are right, Duke of Bedford. The maid's first error. She should place the crown on her own head. When it comes to the actual coronation, there will be a little cushion like this one. You'll kneel on it, and I will anoint you. - And which way will the people be? - People? Yes, my dear subjects. Those who pay the taxes. That way. Well, I think that I'll kneel with my face a little more toward them. not that I think too well of my face, but after all, I am their King and they may as well get used to it. Oh, come in my dear Trémouille we were just rehearsing the ritual of my coronation. Oh, then it is you who is to be crowned today? What do you mean? Riding through the crowded streets, one gets the impression that this is the maid's coronation. That's because she is a very pretty girl in armour and exciting to look at, and she has done extraordinary things. Oh! Very Kingly! Most Royal! Put that on in public Charles but in private it's high time that you realize that this girl is both ambitious and unscrupulous, and if the war goes on and her military party keeps the ascendant, she, not you, will rule in France whether you're crowned or not. If you were a window, my dear Duke, you couldn't be easier to see through. This girl is the only person around me who isn't after power and money, including you! Everything she's done, she's done for me and for France. She's very clever. She knows she has to win you first! But as for power, she has more power now than you and I and Burgundy put together. The whole country's behind her! Well, if you want to put it that way... What's on your mind, Trémouille? I fear for you that's all. And for yourself and with very good reason. If your highest wishes to practise kneeling just once more. Yes, I do. Very well my Lord, I'll send the messenger away. - Messenger? What messenger? - Why Burgundy's. - He's here begging for a truce. - Truce? What nonsense. - How much will they pay? - 50,000 crowns if you give the order to stop fighting. - And how much do you get? - I? I... I've nothing to do with it. Your usual share is half, my loving crocodile and you haven't changed. I want your share. I want 100,000 in my hands. And I'm not even sure that I'll take it. What shall I tell him? You tell him to wait, we are in no hurry. Very well, my Lord. Charles! How can you think of money at this fateful and serious moment? I don't know. But I can without the slightest effort. Forgive me, my dear Archbishop, but you must know about governments. I have said and I say again that this war is unnecessary bloodshed, and the sooner we end it, the better. If only I knew what to do. Joan might drive my dear cousin Burgundy right out of the country if she continues, and that might be the best thing. It's so difficult to know what "is", the best thing. When I'm king, then I'll know. Sire, this is the day we fought for and waited for and it has come. I'm as happy as any mortal has ever been, for I've watched the anointing and the coronation of my King. - Hurray! - Long live the King! Long live the King! Long live the King! Joan the Maid! Joan the maid! On to Paris! I'll see the messenger in the robing room. - Oh, they didn't touch, they didn't touch. - They kissed, they kissed. Just as I kiss you now. - Your Majesty... - Only our kissing is a very different matter isn't it, my dear? - Oh, your Majesty, you must take care. - No, that's your part to take care. Mine is to be bold, careless and reckless. To enter where I will and depart when I choose. For look, the world is mine. Look about you, this is a real court now and I'm a King to be reckoned with. It is lovely, the scent of jasmine. I could stay here in Sully forever. Yes, well next week we must go to Loches to be feasted, - And the week after that to Blois. - There seems to be no end to these invitations. And to the tributes! See? And for the reference, do you remember that little tailor at Chinon who wouldn't trust me for a new coat? Now... Nay, here comes that vulture again. Well Trémouille, do you come to bring me money? Or to take it away with you? Your Majesty, this is a much more important matter than money. The man's mad. Here, Chartille, take my place. And don't cheat! - She's here. - Is she alone? No, she brought Alençon with her. Remember Sire, it's absolutely imperative that this time you keep your word. - When have I not kept my word? - Yesterday. Well, that was yesterday. Greetings, my friends. Joan, we've asked you into the presence because we've missed you, our most favourite subject. My noble King, for weeks we have waited outside the walls of Paris for your arrival. We should have struck in the hour of victory. But it is not too late now. Keep your promise. Ride with us and - Paris shall yet be ours. - I'm sorry Joan but you've to cancel all such plans. - I have just negotiated a truce with Burgundy. - A truce? - That's madness. - It's been too much bloodshed. The Tourelles has been terribly torn, we need peace. Our enemies need peace, my King, but not you. Let them go home to their island and they can have a good and lasting peace. We only have to go forward now. - And their last great stronghold will fall. - I tell you I have decided upon a truce. I have decided. But you cannot do this, my King. It would mean that you threw away all the advantages. We have fought so hard and have given so much blood to win. - His Majesty has signed the truce. - Signed it? Yes. And our King never repudiates his word. You know how this looks, your Highness? Like betrayal or stupidity. Or both! I never said that I was wise, I never said I was honest, I never said I was handsome. I'm not a particularly good person to be a King, but as long as I am a King, I will be a King. What do you know statecraft? What do you know of the experience which the heads of nations must stoop? A ruler must compromise and bargain with the lowest sort of people, even the enemy. Men are governed by corruption, they like it. Men hate corruption and God hates it. I don't know, but men take to it very naturally. What does this mean? He's betrayed us Joan. It cannot be true. My King, have you taken... money from our enemies? That is not a question the King should answer. Or be asked. Then you have done it. You have betrayed us. All of us. Your country and even yourself. I shall tell the people of France what you've done. I hate war, I don't like battles, every time I see French blood flowing I can... I can feel the hair rise on my head. - With all my soul I prayed for peace. - We are at peace. We cannot have peace so till our land is free. It happens that I am the one that decides what war we fight and what peace we keep. I warn you, make any dirty truce you like. - We'll march on Paris with or without sanction. - No my dear cousin, you will not. I ordered the dismissal of the army. I'm sick of all these warriors clanking about in armour. You Alençon, Laire, Dunois, all of you. Put down your battle-axes, you're ordered home. And from now on, all commands come from me. If my captains leave, I shall leave also. Not your captains, my captains. And you also will do as you are told. Not as you please. - About the present... - Ah, yes. Joan, we've decided to ennoble you as a token of our gratitude. And your town of Domrémy will be exempt from taxation. But you must remain with the court until you are given permission to leave. Now come and join us. After a century of defeat, we began to win. We did win. Battle after battle. And now, just as we are about to end the war, we're ordered to disband. To retreat from an enemy that is on the run. Why has this happened? How could this happen? Charles can't bear that the people love the maid more than their King. That finishes me... I've looked my last on Charles the Despicable. Come to Normandy with me Joan. We can go on fighting there. Our King has ordered you home. My home is where the English wait behind the hedges. But you Joan, where will you go? My King has ordered me to stay with him. You'll be his captive then, a prisoner at the court. Held there lest you make war on his enemies and spoil his bargains. Joan, you said you'd speak out and tell the people what kind of king they have. If you're honest with yourself and the people who followed you, you cannot stand by him any longer, you cannot be silent. Should I speak against him and leave him? - Yes! - No. Why Dunois? If you speak against him, he'll still be King. If you leave him, he'll still be King. And what will France have then? A government of pure corruption! No faith, no good angel, Nothing but corruption! But if you remain by his side he'll sometimes have to think of you and of the people of France, and not always of his own interests. But would I be honest to stay? Was it God's will that you set the Dauphin on his throne? Yes. Well, this is the King he chose. Make's a man wonder if God could be wrong. No. No, God could not be wrong. This is the King he chose. And yet... Every government is made up of bargainers, Joan. That's to be expected. And it's a lucky country where they don't have it all their own way. But there's somebody like you about to make the bargainers behave. I'll stay with him, 'til the truce ends. The truce may never end. Then I'll dedicate my white armour to God, and lead his armies no more. Don't lose heart Joan. If anything could make me lose heart, saying goodbye to you three. It can't end here. We'll meet again, Joan. I was never much with... words, Joan. Except for profanity. And this is beyond swearing. Goodbye, dear friend. And good soldier. Did you say your prayers this morning? That's what I forgot. Remember me when you say them. Joan, let me kneel to you this once. You are more to me than any King or Queen could ever be. To me you are France and France is yours. You lifted her up when she was dying and set a cup of victory to her lips. We've all drunk from that cup. It's made a new nation of us. Made new men of all of us. Many of whom are now dead, as I could wish I were now that this has happened. King of heaven, I've come to fulfil a vow. The truce with Burgundy signed. We're at peace and I shall wear this white armour no more. I leave it here, at your altar. We are at peace, my King. But not such a peace as we dreamed. No, horrible and evil an armistice, with much of the war to be fought. And our enemies preparing. And we... dwindle here from town to town, holding court. Receiving embassies and dismissing soldiers. From town to town we have feasted. From city to city I have attended, doing the King's bidding. We must feast in many more if the plan holds. But, oh, sweet God, the food is bitter. I would rather sleep on the ground again and chew my handful of beans and rice and to face the rank of English spears, for this way we shall lose all we have won. Even I can see that. And my voices have said nothing. If only my voices would speak to me again. If they would tell me what I should do then I could sleep at night and accept what comes to me but they are silent. I asked again and again. Must I remain with the King and his household? Busy with the nothings that fill these days? If my voices do not answer, I cannot stay here. I must arm again and find the enemy and fight as before. Let my voices speak to me if this is wrong. Let them speak to me now. Have I been abandoned? Have I made an error that is not forgiven? There is still no answer. Then I must go. And fight the enemy, King of heaven. I shall find another armour, not this shining one in which I rode as your messenger. But another dark and humble, fitting to a common soldier. Long ago my voices told me that I would be taken prisoner. When it comes, at least I shall have arms in my hands. I think I have courage to die. But not to die thus in small, sick ways. Daily. Inform the master they're bringing in the witch! The maid is captured! Come here, look! There's the witch! The witch! Why she's only a girl! So you are the maid... The peasant girl who leads armies, crowns Kings, and sets soldiers quaking in their boots. As a Frenchman, your great admirer. As a Burgundian, your fortunate captor. - At the gates of Compiègne? - Yes, my Lord. The city shut the gates in our faces as we descended upon her and her few followers. - We were careful not to wound her. - Well done, captain. My dear, look after her good health. - You shall be in good hands, Joan. - They've taken my ring. I want it back. His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvais. - Welcome, your Grace. - Greetings, Count. A goblet of wine? Wine is always good over a bargain. Why yes, thank you. It seems to me, I remember this room under less happy circumstances. Yes, as I remember you were a bit breathless. You were running from the maid. - Whom you now have. - Whom I now have. Shall I have the money sent up? 5,000 pounds is not enough, your Grace. I can do much better elsewhere. 5,000 pounds is a great deal of money. Kings have been ransomed for less. But this is something different, this is a witch. Witches are expensive. 5,000. Yes or no? I've used 10 bags. The question is does each bag contains 500 or 1,000 pounds. Bishop, could it be possible that you're lying? It looks to me as if you're authorised to go as high as 10,000 pounds. If I said that I were, you'd want 15. If you're a true Christian, you'd give her up for nothing. She's a sorceress, a heretic! An idolatress! - She must be burned. - Oh now, now... wait Bishop. If this is entirely a religious matter, why do you offer me English coin? England is a true daughter of our church. She's with us heart and soul, in the matter of scorching this heresy. Oh, yes. When the maid beat the English. Yes of course, that was heresy. Not to mention her booting you out of your Bishopric. - Whose side are you on, my friend? - This same side we're all on. The me side, what's in it for me. That's my side, and it's your side. And the English side, and the French side, and the Burgundian side. Of course... this girl, she's the only one I know who is not on the me side. And that's why I'm ashamed when I think I'd sell her. - Yes, even for 10,000 gold pounds. - Very well, 10,000. Will you take it? Shall we count it out? You spin and sew so well! I have some beautiful cloth from Brussels. Why don't we make a dress for you Joan? Thank you, my lady but don't want one. While I'm dressed as I am everyone can see that I still stand for what I have done. No, I cannot change. What is it, Marguerite? The master wants the maid. Where is he? He's in the strong room, counting money. A mountain of money! My King! My King has sent my ransom! The English... ...not my King. You may take her. Scriveners, lords, masters and fathers, I, Pierre Cauchon, by divine mercy, Bishop of Beauvais, gratefully thank you for coming here to the City of Rouen, to assist me in the trial that is about to begin. I am confident that I speak for us all, when I say that it is our most ardent wish, that this trial shall be just, unbiased and irreproachable. The more so since it is the command of our Sovereign, His Royal Majesty, Henry VI, King of France and of England, whose representative, the Earl of Warwick, is honouring us with his presence. My Lord... in accordance with the orders you gave me, and as promoter of this case, I have cited the woman, commonly known as Joan the maid, to appear this morning here before us, and to answer the accusations brought against her. Master Jean Le Maistre will you bring the accused before us? My Lord, the said Joan has two requests she begs you to grant, First, that she may be allowed to hear mass before appearing. Second, that you have French priests as well as English, to sit beside you. These points have been mentioned before, Master Jean. After consulting the most eminent lords and authorities, and taking into consideration the crimes of which she is accused, as well as the indecency of her attire, we could not grant her permission to hear mass. Also, apart from Master William Hatton, who is English, we the judges are all Frenchmen, and good Frenchmen. Bring the accused before us. You may sit if you wish. Thank you, father. I'll stand. At first anyway. Acting upon common report, public rumour, and various informations obtained by us, we have summoned you before us as a suspect of heresy and sorcery. Will you swear to speak the truth concerning everything we shall ask you? My Lord, I do not know what your questions will be. Perhaps you will ask me things I should not answer. - She's afraid to answer! - Burn her and have it done with! Of my mother and of my father and what I did after I left home to take part in the war I will tell you willingly. But of certain revelations which have come to me from God, I will speak to no one save Charles, my King. Why should God make revelations to you? God makes revelations to whom He pleases. Will you swear to speak the truth on matters concerning the faith? I swear to speak the truth on questions concerning the faith. What is your name? My name is Joan. At home I was called Jeannette. How old are you? I am 19 I think. You say that you have had revelations from God. Can you tell us when it first happened? When I was thirteen years old, I heard a voice in my father's garden. It was at noon time in the summer. The voice was at my right, toward the church. And it spoke to me from amidst of a great light. When I first heard it I was frightened, What did the voice say? First it spoke only of things near at hand and how I should live my life. But then, then later it said to me Go!... Go raise the siege of Orleans. Have the Dauphin crowned at Rheims. Drive the English from French soil. Did you answer this voice? I said I was only a poor girl from the farms who knew nothing of courts and warfare. But still the voice said to me, Go child of God, daughter of France, Go! This voice that spoke to you, whose voice was it? At first I thought it was an angel. Then later I knew it was Saint Michael who spoke. Sometimes Saint Catherine appeared to me. And Saint Margaret. Did you see these saints, or did they speak to you only? I saw them as clearly as I see you now. Did your King see your saints? Pass over that. This does not concern your trial. She has no right! - Proceed. - Do the saints have hair on their heads? It's good to know that they have. Do they wear clothes? Is God so poor that he cannot clothe his saints? Did Saint Margaret speak in English or in French? Why should she speak English? She is not on the English side. Do your saints hate the English? They hate what God hates and they love what God loves. God? Does he hate the English? Of God's love or hate for the English, I know nothing. I know only this, that the English will be driven from French soil. Except for those that are buried here. God will give my King a great victory and Charles the 7th will be King of all France! Do you believe that you are in a state of grace? If I am not, may God put me there. If I am then, may he keep me there. That is a good answer, Joan. We can do without your comments, Master Jean. Who counselled you to throw off women's clothes and dress like a man? A thing indecent... and contrary to the teachings of the holy scriptures. For that I blame no one. Having lived among soldiers it was more fitting for me to wear man's clothes. But give me a woman's dress and I will wear it if you permit me to hear mass. Otherwise I will not put it on since it pleases God that I wear this one. All I have done, I've done by the command of my Lord. That is all that I've done well. How do you know that your voices come from God? I knew that they came from God because what they commanded me to do was only good. My Lords, I have answered these same questions at Poitiers. My King charged the Archbishop of Rheims and other loyal and learned priests to examine me before I was allowed to lead his army. Send for the records at Poitiers, and you shall have all my answers. The examination at Poitiers by the Archbishop of Rheims has no relevance. We are your judges now and you must answer us! But you are not fitted to be my judges. You are my mortal enemies. English... and Burgurdians. All of you. And you are not the church. You are the valets of the enemy King whose orders you obey. If I am being tried by the church, why am I not in a church prison among women? I am in a English prison guarded by English soldiers and chained... chained to my bed. If I must rise for any purpose I must ask the guards to unlock the bonds. We, your judges, keep you chained because you've attempted to escape. Is it not a right of all prisoners of war to try to escape? You say that you are my judges. I do not know if you are, but I say this, take care not to judge me wrongly, for in truth I am sent by God and you place yourself in great danger. Take her back to her cell! Good day, my Lords. You and your flawless trial. The girl's too clever for you! She ridicules you! - Yes and threatens you in public. - I can assure you, my dear Warwick. It won't happen again. No it will not, for there will be no more public sessions. You will continue behind closed doors according to my orders. Is that the chapel, Father? - Yes, Joan. - May I enter? No daughter, it is forbidden. Do you know why? It is forbidden. Your Grace, perhaps we should not say no so quickly to this child's request concerning the records of Poitiers. Since we were not on the maid's side in the war, we can hardly judge her... - in unbiased fashion. - This is an ecclesiastical court, governed solely by the unbiased laws of the church. The laws of the church? Do they demand English guards at the doors? Do they insist that English gold bears the expense? - Silence Calleis. - No, your Grace. Such a procedure contravenes our laws. - I can take no part in this trial. - Then you may leave. And any of you who are of his opinion may leave also. But remember this, if you go now, you carry my enmity with you. And the enmity of the King of England. The King of France and of England. I'm sorry to leave with your mercy. Or your lack of mercy. But for my conscience sake I cannot witness what seems to me but a preconceived and shameful farce. You will come with us. - I? - Yes. You're under arrest. I should be in a church prison, guarded by women. Must you leave me here, Father Massieu? I'm commanded to leave you here. God keep you, child. Joan, this is Master Jean Laverne, who has been assigned by the most reverend Inquisitor of France. To assist us at your trial. Master Jean has read all the reports of the preceding sessions. And is therefore well acquainted with your case. I am Jean and I promise you that we will judge you justly. But you're an unlettered girl and need council. You may choose one of the judges to advise you. I thank you. But I have no intention of departing from the council of my Lord. Will you swear to speak the truth on everything we ask you? I've come before you countless times. Again and again I have sworn. You burden me too much! Have you heard your voices recently? Yes. For a while they were silent. - Now they speak to me daily. - Did they appear to you in your cell? I do not always understand what they say. My guards make too much noise. What do your voices tell you? To answer you boldly. Did they promise to deliver you? Saint Catherine told me that I would be rescued. I do not know whether this means that I would be delivered by a French attack upon this city Rouen. Or something else, but I was told that I would be freed by a great victory. - Can you remember the exact words? - Yes. Accept everything with courage. Do not fear your martyrdom. For in the end, you shall be in the kingdom of paradise. What does the voice mean by... your martyrdom? I... I am not sure. It may mean what I suffer here in prison. Night after night, I have no sleep and still I must come before you and answer questions. The same questions. Come before half mad with what I must endure in my cell. Without... without rest, without rest, day or night. I do not know how much more I will have to suffer. I refer myself to God. Do you think you will go to the Kingdom of Paradise? Yes, surely as if I were already there. - This is a very grave answer. - Yes! And I hold it for a great treasure. What was the sign you gave to your King in the chapel of Chinon that made him believe you were sent by God? I think you've asked me that question 100 times and I've told you again and again you shall have no answer from me! It does not concern this trial! Was this sign made of, ah, gold or silver, or jewels? No goldsmith in the world could fashion a crest or sign so rich and fair. It will last 1,000 years. - Was it a crown? - I did not say it was a crown. Well, what was it then? If you wish to know, go to my King and ask him. - This harlot mocks our court! - You ask me questions I have sworn not to answer, and yet you keep asking them. What do you wish of me that I perjure myself? Scriveners, stay your hand. Don't write that answer. Joan, if we prove to you that you have acted against the faith, are you ready to submit to the church? I beg you to believe that, I would never do or say anything against the church. And if I had done such a thing I would willingly reject it. - That is a good answer Joan. Now I... - If you accept the decision of this court, you would reject your voices. If you still maintain that your voices are right, you reject the church. If you do not obey, you are a heretic! I would not reject the voices of my Lord nor the church! It seems to me that it is all one. Our Lord and our church. Why do you make such a difficulty about it? Why did you display your banner at the coronation? It had shared in the toil. It was only right that it should share in the honour. Did the poor kiss your hands and garments and have masses said for you? They came to me happily, how could I push them away? And if they prayed for me, I believe they did no wrong. Did you receive the sacraments in man's clothing? - Did you bless the weapons? - Did you seek out your King? - My Lords, I can answer only one at a time. To be sure of yourself, to be proud, to be boastful! These are the sins of Satan! She is a heretic, an apostate, and a sorceress. And she must go to the stake. But we must discredit her before she dies. For she is not just a sorceress, she is a symbol, adored by the people of France. If we burn her now we make a martyr of her, and that's exactly what her King wants us to do. But, if we can force her to recant, to abjure, to renounce her voices, her mission and her King, the people will lose faith in her, and in the King that was crowned by a heretic. They will accept our Henry as the lawful King of France. Very well, my lord bishop, proceed with your plan. But let me remind you: The maid must die at the stake if you're ever to be archbishop of Rouen. It's myself then, it could be nice in here if you don't listen. Well, look wench. I'll unlock your chains. Give your flesh a chance to heal. I'll loosen your fetters. Let you walk about the cell. I'll give you cheese and wine. You'll be burned, you'll be burning in the square, You'll die without knowing what it is to be kissed. Look at me. Look at me wench! Take your hands off her! Don't give me orders. You're only a perth. I shall report you to the captain. You know, I wouldn't do that if I were you, Frenchman. - You mustn't put yourself in danger for me Father. - My child. We think we know a way to save you Joan. I don't want to die! But I cannot deny my voices. I'll damn my soul to save my life. There's another way. An appeal to the Pope. These are liturgical matters, my child, but it seems if you make such an appeal they cannot continue with this shameful trial. According to the laws of the Church, they must send you to Rome, or submit a report and wait for the Pope's decision. I wish I could go to Rome. The Pope...would believe me. Who gave you permission to enter this cell? Get out of here at once. Do you submit? I appeal to the Pope who is at Rome. Take me there and I shall submit to him. - Silence! This is very serious, my Lord. - She is within her rights. - This appeal is expensive. - We cannot proceed with the trial. - We shall proceed. But if we were to continue, the trial would be illegal and the verdict null. - You're saved, Joan. - The devil's tail, Priest! If I see you whisper to her again I'll have you thrown into the Seine. As for this appeal to the Pope, I refuse to allow it. The King commands here, not the Pope. He's paid a high price for this witch. And he's also paying for your services, my Masters, Doctors and Bishops. That is why I appeal to the Pope, who takes orders from no King. The appeal is overruled. Erase it from the record! Yes, you surely write what is against me but nothing that is for me. Take her away! May I have your attention, my Lords? His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvais, sent me the articles of accusation of this case, and asked me to give him my opinion of the conduct of this trial. Quite so your Grace, but I would hardly hope that you would trouble yourself to appear in person. I fear that my letter might become lost, as so many others have. However, having witnessed today's session, I am ready to render my opinion. Write this down, scribe. I, Jean, Bishop of Avranches, declare that this trial is unlawful. That the appeal made by the accused and witnessed by me among others, is definitely and completely suspensive. And that all future procedure of this case must be referred to Rome. - Why don't we go to my apartment... - If the maid's appeal is overruled, it is further proof of the widespread rumours that circulate throughout the Christian world that this is not a religious but a political trial. I warn you, you the so called judges, you may succeed in sending her to the stake. But one day, your English King will be ashamed of these proceedings. Rome will declare the truth about this girl. And France will praise the maid for it's birth as one nation. And as for you, Pierre Cauchon, Count Bishop of Beauvais, I declare you a traitor, for you have betrayed your country and you betray... your church. Your Grace, at this time I cannot permit... I will not permit... It's spring, father. Yes child, it's the 9th day of May. We have tried to avoid this Joan, but your stubborn and arrogant attitude has left us with no alternative. If you continue to hide the truth, if you persist in your heresy, you will be put to the torture. Joan, there is still time. You must admit that your voices are evil. They have lied to you just as you have lied to us. No, they tell me only truth! Even though I don't know what they mean by my rescue, or my victory. God's ways are not always our ways. You have asked for your torture. If you tear me limb from limb, separate my soul from my body, I will not deny my voices! And if I did, I would always declare afterwards that you had compelled me to say it by force! I have asked my voices... if I would be burned... and they have told me to rely entirely... on God. Tomorrow morning, in the cemetery of St Ouen, we've decided to hold our last session. With your physician's consent, we are taking Joan there. And if she again refuses to abjure, we're abandoning her and handing her over to the civil authorities. I shall order the execution under being readiness. This Joan, whom you see before you, has fallen from error into error, from crime into crime. Never before in France has there appeared such a monster. She is a witch, a heretic, a schismatic. Even her King himself is a heretic, because he sought to regain his throne with the help of such an apostate, we brought you here to this sacred and ancient cemetery to give you your last chance in public. Will you or will you not revoke all the acts to which your voices drove you and which where your judges have condemned? Burn the witch! Burn the witch! I submit to God and our holy Father the Pope. The Pope is in Rome, we cannot go so far. You must submit to us. If you do not, we shall hand you over to the executioner now. I submit to God and our holy Father the Pope. You must submit to us or die. If you submit, we'll send you to a church prison. Do you hear, Joan. If you submit, you'll be taken to a church prison where there will be women to guard you. Joan, he's reading the sentence of your excommunication. Submit. - This means her death. - Sign, Joan! Abjure! Abjure! Abjure? What does it mean to abjure? It means to submit to your judges. If you do, you can escape the fire and you'll be delivered from the English prison. Almost, sweet God. Submit! Submit! - Abjure Joan! - Abjure! - Abjure! - Please abjure! Save yourself! Save yourself, Joan! I submit my words and actions to you. - I'd rather abjure than be burned. - She submits herself! She submits! No, Joan. You must sign your name. Silence! The maid has submitted. We must receive her with penitence. In the name of our Lord, Amen. At last, you've come back to the bosom of our mother church. And thus we absolve you from the excommunication. But in order that you should expiate your crimes. And to make sure that you will not fall back into heresy, we condemn you to perpetual prison, to the bread of sorrow, and the water of affliction. Father, take me to your church prison. Give me women to guard me. She's escaped. You've deceived us, and you've betrayed the King. If only you would trust her ? I've told you and again and again. She will burn. We shall catch her yet. We will send you a woman's dress, wear it. Do not wear the attire of a man ever again. I'll obey. No! No! No! They told me they would take me to church prison! Oh! They lied to me! They lied to me! Oh! No! Oh, sweet God. Forgive me. Forgive me. I was afraid. What I said... was for fear of the fire. I have damned my soul to save my life. You speak to me, and I denied you. My child... Your woman's dress. You haven't changed into it. They come this morning to make sure you kept your oath and you've broken it! You must put this on. Put it on quickly before they arrive. The guards will unlock your bonds. It's too late. Exactly as I expected. She has not kept her word. - She meant nothing of what she said. - She meant all that she said. But we have not dealt honestly with her. The guards are still here, just as before. She has retained the clothes of a man. - She has broken her signed abjuration! - We made it impossible for her to keep it. You exceed your function here, Master Jean! I appeal to the Inquisitor. She shall have her sentence and nothing else. One moment, my Lords. If this girl has been tricked into breaking her vow, I will not share in a sentence against her. If we leave your cell, all of us, will you put on this dress? No, my Lord, I will not. I've heard my voices again. They told me I did a very wicked thing by denying them but they have forgiven me. I have faith in them. I have none in you. This is a fatal answer. Joan, Do you know what this means? It means the fire. Your death. To live without faith is more terrible than the fire, more terrible than dying young. I have nothing more to do here. Send me back to God for whom I came. Be of good cheer, my lord. It is all over. Yes. The executioner will see to the rest. What shall I write for the records? Write that she has relapsed. We are forced to abandon. Bishop...I die through you. If she's excommunicated, why do they give her absolution and holy communion? The bishop said give the maid everything she wants. He keeps contradicting himself. It's another proof of his inconsistency and guilty conscience. It cannot take long to die. There will be a little pain but then it will end. The pain won't be little... but it will end. I see it so clearly now. My victory, is my martyrdom. My escape. My death. Stand back! Back away! Get away! Pull the guards! Sorceress! God be with you Joan! Forgive me! Maid of God! Forgive me! Forgive me! Oh, Lord, pardon us all! That hurts! Only a child! Save her! Get out of the way! Back away! Back away! You, the devil Bishop! In the name of our Lord, Amen. Could I have a cross? To hold in my hands! Ah, what shame that after the abjuration of your errors, the devil of heresy has once more risen in your heart. You have returned to your crimes, therefore we the judges same decree that you, Joan, commonly called the maid, have been on the subject of your pretended divine revelations. - A relapsed heretic, - God bless you. A sorceress, lying, seducing, pernicious, presumptuous, seditious, cruel, apostate and schismatic. And so we abandon you to the civil authority, requesting the same authority that it may be pleased to moderate its judgement and if true signs of penitence should appear that the sacrament of penance may be administered to you. I am a good Christian. Executioner! Do your duty! Coward! Heresy! Oh mistaken men, traitors to yourselves and your country, you thrust greatness and an undying name upon your chief enemy. Now the executioner has lighted the faggots, and sends her spirit up from the fire, and cast her body to the winds, and you shall never hear the end of this day's work. The winning of a few victories that could put aside as a nine days wonder, but you've made her a symbol, and her ashes and her words will blow like seeds and take roots on deserts and pavement. They will flower into heralds and prophets, to spread her fame. This will be her age, her century, and all the rest of us, priests and kings, will be minor figures in her tragedy. Father, pray for me. I shall be damned forever, I've burned a Saint! Go, child of God, daughter of France! Go. - Go! - Oh, sweet God. You who have been with me always. Be with me now, through the darkness. For I meant to hurt no one. Let none be hurt for me. Come to her assistance, ye saints of God. Come forth to meet her, ye angels of the Lord. Receiving her soul, offering it in the sight of the most high. May Christ receive you with chorally and may the angels lead thee into paradise. And... and the the hour of our death... amen. Jesus. Jesus!
