A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES The characters and situations presented here, and the names used in this show are fictitious. Any similarity to names, characters, stories or other events associated with actual persons or situations is purely coincidental. Ms. Duarte, is there anything you want to add about your client? Thank you, Your Honor. I'd like to highlight the key factors that would allow you to grant my client his parole. Mr. Cruz spent four years in prison. He formed and participated in reintegration activities, not only for his benefit, but for some of his fellow prisoners. He's an example of effort and good behavior, and he does not represent a danger to society. A society that should be able to enjoy his talent when he's a free man. Thank you. Indeed, this court acknowledges the social work that Mr. Cruz developed inside the prison with his Jail Music Program. Yes, sir. It was something that I came up with despite everything that was happening to me. I am aware of how much damage I have done to society, and it was a way of giving back, to redeem myself. Music has been a part of my life since I was a child, I carry it with me in my blood. And… And I know this is a way of clearing my head, freeing myself from that mental prison, the hardest thing to endure when you're in there. In response to the request presented by Mr. Carlos Cruz before this criminal court of Medellín, it is decided that, since he presented and physically served part of his sentence in jail, and thanks to the social work done inside the correctional facility, and his good behavior, this court recommends that his application for parole be considered. No. Let me remind you, Mr. Cruz, that you are forbidden to leave the country or to misbehave in public spaces. Additionally, you must present yourself before this court twice a month. Failure to comply shall constitute a reason to lose your right to parole. Yes, sir. It's important, Mr. Cruz, that you continue leading the music program you've developed inside the prison. Yes, Your Honor. I will. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. We're adjourned. Let me sit here. Just a little while. I can't believe it. My God. Thank you, princess. Thank you so much. Hey, wait. Just a second. It's okay. -Give him a moment. -Let me say something. Princess, I know you hate me. I don't blame you, but I swear, I'll prove myself. You and my kids will know I'm not lying. You don't know justice. Don't say that. I've changed. I swear. -You don't fool me! -Calm down. You don't fool me. Stay away from Erik. I won't allow you near him! Listen to me. Don't say that. I'm not the enemy. You and I will always be enemies. I have my whole life to change that. -All my life. -We're leaving. Wait. Listen to me. You'll forgive me, and we'll be friends again. -I swear. Hear me. -Scum. Never. What hurt the most was losing you. What I feel for you, I've never felt it before. Scum! Let's go, Charly. Did you hear, bro? I heard that the people at Grey Shark were looking for a talent incubator. Careful, those people know everybody, and have the money to pay for any artist they like. -You know what we have to do? -What? We have to plan a great strategy to lure new and young talent. I don't know. Something exclusive. -Am I right? -That ship has sailed, bro. What do you mean? Weren't the battles shut down? The neighborhood is too hot, that's why everything is suspended. But everything changed when they took those thugs. -Really? -You know what? We can resume the singing battles. Awesome, dude. Surround will get involved. We'll value the kids who deserve it. They get motivated. -What do you think? -Dude. No divisions this time. I mean, all urban rhythms merging, all together in one, right? For example, without tagging anyone, okay? Well, in the end, borders are just invisible lines in our heads. Wow, right on, sensei. Are you mocking me? -No. -Get serious, man. That could be the battle's motto. Get serious, I said. I mean it. Say it again. Borders are just imaginary lines in our heads. -Oh, man. -Is this for real? -For real. -Awesome. -Here. -Yes. So, who's sponsoring? Mero Power, Surround? Both. Hold that thought. Wait. Hey, babe. Everything all right? I'm here with Búho, doing some… I was held in contempt, Juan. I'm at the DA's office. Can you pick me up? Why, baby? What happened? I'll tell you later. -But Charly got out. -What? Okay, I'm on my way. What happened? Go on, big guy. Keep going. Wait. Breathe. Keep going, big guy, keep going. I'm free! I'm free, bro! Hey, big guy. Careful. -Come on. -Go on, dude. Free as a bird, bro! Dude, I knew you were leaving first. So cool, bro. I'll wait for you on the outside, and we'll keep on singing. You're going places, man. I swear. -Right on. I'll keep the songs flowing. -Yes, bro! Hey, boss. Well-deserved. Come here, man. And stop calling me boss. -Don't do it again. -Well, that's how we see you. -As a leader. -That's right. -Listen to him. -Look. This time, I leave the bad behind And you know I won't mute it You're free, be happy And enjoy your family I'll leave envy on standby We're not your buddies Enjoy, we're your family Amen, dude. Awesome, bro! Thank you. When you got here, we thought you wouldn't last a day, and that you were a jerk, but I witnessed your change. Congratulations. We don't see it too often around here. You know what? Seriously. You were one of the first who believed in me. I appreciate it. God bless you. Come here. Now that you're leaving, let's take a picture to show my… Shut up. I'll show it to my wife and daughters. They know all your songs. Nobody believes the wife story anymore. Here, go on. Thanks, bro. Truly, thank you. Thanks a lot. You lied to me, honey. You weren't with your therapist, you went to see Charly. I didn't want him out. I won't sit back and do nothing. I didn't say anything to you because I didn't want to have this argument with you. But what for? He got away with it. Again. He won. Won what? Is this a competition? No. It's justice. It's a matter of justice. But this scum, again, tricked everyone. His future is not up to you. -Leave it alone. -How? Tell me how. I don't know how, but it's enough. This Charly thing has haunted you for over 20 years. And for our sake, I pray it comes to an end. No more. Well, we just have to do some official paperwork and we're done. Two days tops. Okay. Is this brat ready to reunite with his dead relative? I don't think so. It's as if prison really changed him. -Listen to you. -I mean it. The Charly you talk about is not the one I know. He is who he is, honey. -Charly is my carbon copy. -Is he? I know he plotted this good boy image. As soon as he gets out, things will change. You know what you have to do when he gets out? Sure. A toast for the dead… and the living. -Cheers. -Cheers. Son, I prayed so much for this opportunity. And we got it. -We got it. -We did. -Yes, Mom. -Thank you, Lord. I'm literally starting from zero. I have nothing. But I don't care, Mom. I'm so happy. What do you mean, nothing? You have me, and we have a home to sleep in, and food to eat. I know, but I don't want to be in your way. -Bothering you. -My house will always be yours. Besides, you gave me enough when you had it all. You know what? I'll make you some beans and stew with chili peppers. Yummy, Mom, sounds great. And I'll help you with your career, too. But this time, we'll do it the right way, as we should have before. Before Manín changed you for the worse. Don't say that, Mom. The only one who's guilty of who I was and what I did is me. Nobody else. Not even Manín, may he rest in peace. Just me. That devil won't rest in peace. I don't want to talk about him. This is a beautiful moment. -God gave us a second chance. -Indeed, Mom. Indeed. God, we'll do things right this time. I love you, honey. -I love you. -Love you too, Mom. I love you! -I'm getting out, Mom. -Yes. -Hi. How are you? -Great. And you? -Welcome. -Thanks. I have an appointment with Mr. Mike Rivera. -Sure. -My name is… Pez Koi. Everybody knows you as Dragon. Nice to meet you. Zafiro. Call me Zaf. Erik Cruz. I know. Come with me. Mike is waiting, and he hates waiting. -Thanks. -Is this a party or something? -Is that Pitizion? -Yes, we're rehearsing. That's Pitizion and Santamaría. Cool. I didn't know what to say She drives me crazy What a beautiful lady And I had to suffer Even if I hide it You can tell I'm crazy for her An independent woman turns me on The Piti The Pitizion For me, a whiskey on the rocks He was having wine Maybe a Malbec One of those Argentine ones We had a good time But I don't go all the way He took me home I said I'll write you later You're not invited in, don't act smart Is he crazy or what? What lasts takes time -Hang on a second. -What's up? I don't know if you want me to help you with the chorus or should I… -Mike, your opinion? -Let's not waste time. Start the way you did. Then go on with your part. What I want is for you to harmonize. Am I making myself clear? -Yes? -Yes. -Together, okay? -Yes. Pez Koi! Great to see you here, superstar. Let me see you clearly. Wow. Come here. You guys go on. Hello. -Don Mike. -No. Just Mike. I'm not that old, am I? Would you like a drink? There's… Whiskey, vodka, beer. I'm good, thanks. -You're sure? -Yes. Listen. It's very clear to me. The fish will remain in his fish tank. What I want you to do now is unleash that dragon you have inside. Spread your wings, make him fly around the world. Around the world. Mike, I really appreciate your proposal, but… I'm never leaving Surround. And you came here to tell me that? Look. Have a drink. Let's go to my office. And you came here just to tell me that? Have a seat. It doesn't make sense… Doesn't make any sense… What am I seeing in his eyes, Zafiro? -Doubt. -Correct. That's okay. Don't feel bad. -With me, you may have-- -Mike. I'm really not interested in your offer. I don't have doubts, either. I just came here to talk to you in person, but I'm not interested in your proposal. Of course you're not. Your decision… is "no" for the moment. But let's not waste time. Look. This is what you need so we can sign this. Mike, I told you. I'm not interested. I'm really fine at Surround. -It's my mom's company and… -Sure. I know all that. That's why I'm telling you… there is a moment in every man's life… when they must leave the nest. Or grow inside it. You can say whatever you want now. But I know you'll be back when you realize a dragon can't spread his wings inside a fish tank. Well, thanks again for the proposal. We'll be seeing each other. -Sure. -Good day. -Bye. -Good luck. There's plenty to work with. Mike. -Are you sure? -Of course I am. That fish came here to test the waters. Why don't you go to that table and pick up those things? It's all dirty. Hey, such delicious beans, mister… José Serna. I'm glad you liked them. I did. I'm Dina. You've just earned a new customer because your beans are excellent. You're welcome here anytime. -How much do I owe you? -Twenty. I'll be coming all the time. -Thank you. -Take care. -Thanks. -Have a good day. I'm sorry to ask you this, but… Is there an open position for a waitress? I really don't know. I'll ask Ligiecita and let you know. I had a terrible experience yesterday, Mr. José. What happened? I went to a job interview in Envigado to manage a ranch. And… I didn't get the job because I'm a woman. How about that? We're in the 21st century, that should not be happening. -That's awful. -Right… They offered me a cooking job, but… Oh no, thank you, God. Work is work. -Right? -Yes, ma'am. But I would like something else. Let's do something. I'll talk to Ligiecita. Give me your phone number and I'll call you. Who's Ms. Ligia? The manager? -No, she's the owner. -You see? Women can be in charge. That's awesome. -Here. -Right on. -And she's my girlfriend, too. -I see. I'm helping her while I find something better for me. Something that will be a better fit. But it's been hard. Things are really hard. What if I give you the information about this ranch? They pay good money. Good money? And they are looking for men. And you seem perfect for that job, Mr. José. What if you get it? I hope they haven't hired anyone. -Yes. -So, do you want the contact? Yes, please. What's your name again? -Dina. -Dina. It's all working out, right? You're with the right people, boss. Sir. Press play. You'll see. You've changed so much, haven't you? My boy. You were the one who hit me the hardest. I was preparing you to be my successor. And you rejected me. He's a jerk, right, boss? And he went to a different producer. Garfio's rivals. Really? We'll hit Garfio with all we have. Make her suffer more than if I had put a bullet in her head. Give me one. Well, here's to Charly. May this be the end of all the suffering, okay? Oh, not you, no. Such a shame we can't be happy the way we should be. Why are you focusing on what can't be? It breaks my heart to see this family so divided. Who knows? If Charly behaves, maybe Erik and Vanesa might forgive him, don't you think? Yes, maybe. We need to celebrate. I have some more good news. What is it? I have a job interview tomorrow. And I have a feeling I'll get it. I know you will. Okay, half an hour to finish, and then, ladies, to your cell. -You got it, dude. -This is the last time. What will you do on the outside? Go see my family, dude. Four years, right? Here, take that one. Leave us alone, Meñeco. A lesson for you, too, rat. Shut your pie hole or I'll give you one as well. -Okay, Meñeco. Leave it. -You know? You never knew what respect was. So you'll get out, but in a wheelchair, bitch. Take this, punk. What? Still mad because your mama fed you in bed? You all right, Charly? You're in serious trouble! Leave him! Get him, now! Stay there! You got lucky, rat! Hey, Drama, dude. Get up. Are you okay? Is Titano a guardian angel or what? Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. -Hey. -What are you watching? -Benja and Salva is about to start. -Wow. Let's watch it together. You were right. I should've told you I was going to court. That's okay, babe. I just don't want you to lie to me. It's the only thing I ask. I'm sorry. I have so many things to be grateful for, I shouldn't think of… Carlos Cruz, AKA Charly Flow, is confirmed to have been released from jail. This after the arraignment judge granted him parole. He'll be released in a few days. Charly Flow's story is well-known nationwide. He went from being a number one artist to having serious problems due to his connections to Dúver Cruz, AKA Manín, his deceased uncle. We'll continue… Who's that man? You got all serious. Some singer who did bad things and went to jail. -Be right back. -Come on, let's watch. Benja and Salva, right? -It hasn't started yet. -No? I figured he would rot in jail for years. Well, that's not up to you. I won't let that happen. Yeimy, please. That's up to the judges. That's for the justice system to decide. What we have to do, you and I, is focus on your future, your work, your children, your music. Stop thinking about him, Mom. How many years of your life have you devoted to getting back at him? You did it. Get him out of your mind. I don't know, babe, this Charly thing has haunted you for over 20 years. And for our sake, I pray it comes to an end. What time does this Yeimy Montoya arrive? -She'll be here soon. -I'm home. There she is. -Thanks. -Hi, Ligia. How are you? -Hi, Yeimy. -How's it going? -Great, and you? -Long time… Yes. I wanted to talk to you about a few things. Well, what? Yes, babe. Go. -Make him brush his teeth. -Sure thing. So. Tell me. Yeimy, I don't know how you feel with Charly getting out of jail. I guess you'll never forgive him, and it's your right. But we're mothers, both of us. And I know you understand a mother's unconditional love. I do believe my son has changed. Well… I don't, Ligia. -No? Why not? -Well… I know him. I know how he acts to get what he wants. I'm sorry that you had to come here to ask me to forgive him, but… No, that wasn't my intention. No. I'm here to ask you to not interfere in the relationship of Charly, Vanesa, and Erik. What relationship? The one that will probably begin once Charly is out of jail. All right, fine. Let them. If they want to forgive him, so be it. -They are adults, aren't they? -Yeimy, let's not fool ourselves. You're a huge influence on them. They do what you say. -Do they? -Yes. What Charly did, he did it himself. Sure, he screwed up. Because of Manín. Ligia. You're still making excuses for him? At this point? -You're his mom. -I'm not making excuses for him. Let's wait until he gets out and he proves himself through his actions. -Let's wait, then. -All right. But please don't poison them… -Good morning! -Hey, sweetie! -Say hi to Ms. Ligia. -Hi! So cute. He looked exactly like you as a child. -Really? -Yes. -They are talking about Erik. -Look, Uncle Erik. Yes, baby. This image makes us think that Pez Koi is the first Colombian artist signed to Grey Shark Records. First round for Grey Shark? A picture is worth a thousand words. What is this? José Serna, sir. Okay, Mr. José. Everything you see here belongs to Albeiro Rosales. He's away right now and can't be here. So I'll decide whether you get the job or not. -God willing. -Fine. So? Do we put a hole in his head or what? He smells like a dead man already, boss. Relax, Dina. That's too easy. I want him close so I can keep an eye on my blondie. All you have to do is follow orders. The boss likes committed people. See, boss. I heard through the grapevine that he used to drink like a sailor. And now he pretends to be good. They say if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. If what you need is someone committed, I'm the right person. I'm perfect for this job. I understand everything about gardening. The only thing I'd say no to is something illegal. Never, ever. No, José. How can you say that? Joselito might want many things from my blondie, but here, I'm God. Come on, let's go. Let me show you what to do. Sing with me That's what I want from you… Vane, careful walking alone, okay? Call me, babe. Bye. Mari, bro. Today's not a good day. Let's do this some other time, okay? Babe, take it easy, will you? Hey, Marinito. You all right? Can I have a word with Erik? -Hey, good morning. -Erik? Come here, we need to talk to you. Hey, sweetie. You okay? Here, babe. Sit here. Let's talk. What were you doing at Grey Shark? Meeting with Mike Rivera. Calm down. -Calm down. -What's going on? Do you think I'd make a deal with them without asking you first? I don't know, babe. You haven't told us anything. I can imagine he promised you the stars, right? -And I said no. -There you go, babe. Problem solved. Please understand how weird it was for us to see you with that guy. I can't see what the problem is. You can talk to us about anything. You know that. What's the big deal? You're just paranoid and you imagine things because of Charly. Okay, yes. Maybe. Maybe, honey. Sorry. Sweetie, please, forgive me. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Sorry. You have to stop thinking about everything he does. Get him out of your head. Baby, I promise, I won't say anything. Do as you please. I trust you. Whatever you decide, okay? I don't want you to be angry with him like I've always been. Okay? -Yes. -DJ, what's up? I've met lots of people here Many stories, many crazy ones People who are supposedly decent Some are rich, some very poor But I'm leaving soon Because I know this is not my fate I'll go find those I've loved Ask for forgiveness from those I've hurt -Awesome, dude. -Way to go. Bro, we're all happy you're getting out, but… don't forget about us. Wait. And you are…? Kidding! Just kidding! Come here. First of all, you won't get rid of me so easily. The music program goes on. All in! That's right. Oh, yes! Titano, dude, come here. Take it easy, be good. I'll be waiting for you guys on the outside. Peace and love for all! Peace and love! -Charly! Charly! Charly! -Thanks for everything. Dude! -Mr. Erik. No. -Relax. You know you can't just get in. I mean it. -I won't be too long. -It doesn't matter. -Mr. Erik, please. Don't… -Miss. No need for introductions. Thanks. Mike! Tell advertising to take them again. You can't just go, don't do this. Don Mike, please. -I'm sorry. -That's okay, Sarita. A dragon doesn't need an appointment. I'm glad to see you again, so quickly. -Zafiro? -Yes. Can we have a moment? Sure. Well. What, then? Shall we sign the contract? No. Mike. I'm sorry. I didn't like how you handled the meeting. What do you mean? That video your people made of me coming in here. My people? Hold it right there with the paranoia. I had nothing to do with it. I'm sure it was some sort of strategy to make me look bad in front of my mom and Juancho. Let me tell you one thing. If you were counting on me to sign this contract, forget about it. You're so wrong. This is Grey Shark. We don't need to resort to that kind of strategy. We don't need it. You're really wrong. Listen. Let me give you some advice. Not only for your career, but for your future. Never say never. When you're ready to move to the next level with your talent, call me. I don't hold grudges. I'm not resentful, okay? Besides, you're young. You're bound to make lots of mistakes. Zafiro, walk him out. Yes? He went back there. -What the hell are you talking about? -Your son, sir. He was back at the record company, Grey Shark. That would be huge, if he did it. -Leave it there. -Can he make it? -No idea. -Okay. Show me. I don't like it. I don't like it. Put it away. Ligia. What? -Yes? -Yes. -I'm so happy for you. -This ranch is great, Ligiecita. Cared for, all green, with cows, horses. Really pretty. And Mr. Albeiro is a gentleman, apparently. -When do you start? -Tomorrow. Hi there. He's getting out tomorrow. In the morning. Fine, sir. -Music? -What? Music? Okay? Good morning. Just like a sigh A memory of that moment When life changed for me I arose again From the shadows renewed Like a bird in flight I stand here before you Building a new life Giving all of the love Today I took back my life I found my way out The hurt is over now A new life Is what I want with you Forget all of the regret Our time has come… Emilio's up. Come here. He can wait. Let's enjoy the present I told you, no excuses To tear us apart Let's enjoy the moment Let's not waste time… Tyrannosaurus Rex! Tyrannosaurus Rex. Show me. Here, sir. Your fruit. -I don't like fruit. -But you must eat it. Okay, let's move this away and have breakfast. -Get some forks and knives. -Sure, babe. -Who's that? I'll go. -Okay. Ding-dong. Say your prayer. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, amen. Delicious cereal. Amen. Juan. -What? Who is it, baby? -Come here. Hello, guys. What's up? Juan Camilo. How are you? Why didn't you say you were coming? It was a last minute thing. I came straight from the airport. My suitcase. I need to see Emi. Look, we need to talk first. Sure, whatever, but… please, let me see him first, okay? -Okay, come in. -Come in. Leave that there. -It's okay. -Thanks. There's someone here to see you. Your mom's here. You're going to give her a hug and a kiss, right? Emi? Emi, how are you? It's me, your mom. Come here. -Yes? -What is it? He's… He's just playing. Hey. I missed you so much. I'm finally here. You're so little. Charly! Charly! Charly! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! We're here outside the central penitentiary, witnessing a moment that does not make us proud. We're free. We're out, princesses. The fans are here to receive him… We're with some people who support him. Come here, princess. The youngest girls in our country, and also some adults who know he's a danger to society and that he shouldn't have been set free. Thank you so much for being here. We're free. -Don't cry! -I'm happy. I'm excited. Go back to jail, rat! What? Shut the window. Thank you for being here. We're out! We hope justice will be served and he goes back to jail to do the time he deserves. I'll be waiting for you. I'll be waiting for you. In the neighborhood. I'll wait for you. Cut. Princess. We're out!
