ONE FINE MORNING Coming. Just a minute. Where is the… The key? Yes, the key. In the lock. You leave it in the door. Where is the door? The door is in front of you. The key’s in the lock. It’s not, fuck! Don’t panic. Reach out to find the doorknob. And turn it. I found it. Find it? Are you turning? Yes, wait. Which way? To the right. There we go. Hello, Dad. Hello, honey. Sit here. You good? Very good. Despite my little problems. And you? I’m fine. And the person you tend to? I mean… your child? Linn? Her teacher’s out sick. She’s thrilled. That’s not too bothersome? I hope she won’t fall behind. Here. And your stuff? You know what I mean. I work a lot. Commemorations start soon. And I’m translating Annemarie Schwarzenbach’s letters. Say again? A Swiss-German writer. Close with Klaus Mann. Klaus Mann, I know that name. Son of Thomas Mann, your favorite writer. Yes, for goodness sake… sure. Can I help? Put your phone down. I’m not sure. You never know if Leila tries calling. Well… we’ll pick up. – We’ll hear and pick up. – Think so? I’m not sure it works. It works. I called before coming. All right. Here. Can we go to the park? Everyone’s there! First a kiss. How was school? Yeah, we did a shooter drill. Meaning? In case of a terrorist attack. What do you do? Lie down on the floor until the police come. Great. That reassures me. – Yours? – Yes, thanks. Sure. Jérémie, thank the lady! Clément? “Lady”? So I’ve aged? The glasses hid your face. Handsome boy. Thanks. He’s grown. – You well? – I am. And you? Not at the North Pole? No… I’m just in Paris. Less exciting than you think. Finish translating those letters? – Remember? – I read Annemarie Schwarzenbach. – I gave you a book. – “Where is the Land of our Promises?” I read it on a boat between Tasmania and Antarctica. – Like it? – The book? Yes, a lot. – And the expedition? – Fine. Except for the seasickness. I want to hear. You never call. You have to. Why me? It’s you who leaves. Not forever. And that’s no reason. That’s true. It took us one hour to reach the beach. This was my first war experience. At one point, we rammed into a German naval mine. We fell into their trap. We had to evacuate the landing craft. The ramp was lowered. I thought we’d snuggle a bit. Yes. It takes two to snuggle. Get dressed. We have lots to do. What? Visit your great-grandmother. Then your grandfather. You can’t do that to me! Show some enthusiasm. You haven’t seen them in ages. They’ll be so happy. Here. Take it easy. Coming! Hello, Linn! I’m glad to see you. Me too. Come in. – Hello, Jacqueline. – Hello, Sandra. Can I help you? How do you feel? You feel okay? Yes. I’m fine. Not too tired? It’s a bit difficult at times, living. Sometimes I go out. To go to the hairdresser, to go… No, the pedicurist comes, the manicurist comes. To go to the dentist. To go for the eyes, for the ears… Everything in need of repair! And I don’t do it all. Because… it’d be too much. I can’t go out always. I can’t go down the stairs. I need someone in front of me. Who I follow. I hold onto the rail, as if… I were in a cage. It makes going out less fun. And in the street, when you’re in a wheelchair, people look at you differently. Because they know you’re very old. But people are nice. “Poor lady, in her wheelchair.” I’m fine. I’m always at ease. You mustn’t let people take pity on you. They mustn’t take pity. You must show you’re there. That you are a living person. Pity, forget that. Never accept pity. See Leila this week? Actually it was a while ago. You’re happy when you’re with her. Very happy. – I always fear… – She stops coming? That’s it. You know she loves you. Yes, really. But, she has a lot of… Obligations. Yes… exactly. She still comes every week. I finished my drawing. It’s for you. Thank you. Excuse me, honey, but it hurts. – Need the bathroom? – Yes! I’ll take you. The bowl’s there. No, this way. You’re good? Yes, don’t worry about me. Not answering? My father. – Maybe he has a problem? – Of course he does. It’s not nice. I’ll call him back, okay? Can I taste? Thanks. Give it back? So good. Give it! No, it’s my ice cream! His condition is deteriorating. Can’t use the bathroom, put on pajamas. Hallucinations. Your father needs more than 1, 2, even 3 visits a day. He needs full-time care. The only choice is a home. You agree, don’t you? Yes. Leila and your aunt want a private nursing home. But a good place in Paris is unaffordable. No professor pension covers it. And no one in the family can pay. I visited two inexpensive private ones, and they’re cash cows. It’s awful. The papers are full of horror stories. I put some aside for you. Thanks. I have the names of two public homes. One in the 18th seems possible. Anyway… brace yourself, it’s no fun. Your father may be GAL 1. Meaning? Autonomy level. 1 is the maximum. He’ll be with much older patients, Alzheimer’s… The ones I saw were zombies. But since he can’t see, maybe he won’t realize. Thanks. Public homes have very long waiting lists. One or two years. Someone must die to free a bed. Privates ones have shorter waiting lists. We’ll have to give up his apartment. And decide what to do with his stuff. Is it that urgent? Sure is! If we pay 5,000 a month, we need money. We can’t waste his retirement on an apartment he’ll never go back to. What about his books? I don’t know. Give them away. Or throw them away. Throw them away? Burn them while you’re at it! You take them! You kidding? You’ve seen my bookshelves! Your basement? It’s filled to the brim! His books are his life. I know, what can we do? An hour by foot back to base. It was getting cold, with the wind. Below 30. I didn’t look before going out. We were plastered. Then I heard a noise. Actually, I felt it. A dull thud. Then a second one, louder. The ice under our feet shook a little. Yannick and I looked at each other. It took us a while, but we understood. What was it? Yannick said it first. “Only a sea leopard can thump so hard.” It was following us for a while. A sea leopard. What’s that? A ferocious predator. The Antarctic floe is his. You’re joking. You’re teasing me. Not at all. They know they dominate the food chain. They eat penguins, seals, walruses… They avoid humans when we’re ashore. But if they mistake you for a penguin, they won’t overthink it. No way! I’m serious. Google it, you’ll see. Are your wife and son okay with your travels? Not always. My travels are very far, very long. It’s romantic too. That’s not how Valérie sees it. You don’t mention her often. I saw her only once. So ask me questions. Been together long? About 10 years. And… are things good? Fair, to be honest. All your travels? Well, not just that. We’ve grown apart. Are you still in love? Are we in love? Why do you laugh? The way you asked. You’ve met no one? Me? No. Hard to believe. But true. Not since Julian died? No one in 5 years. The memory of him holds you back? No, I don’t think so. I just feel my love life is behind me. Stop talking like an old lady. You can still love and be loved. Bye. Readers enjoy positive emotions. But the study shows that the strongest emotion is anger. Articles that make readers angry are 30% more likely… Sandra Kienzler? Georg Kienzler’s daughter? Yes. He said you were a translator. I was a student of his. He was amazing. I still reread his lectures. That’ll make him happy. Can I have his email? I’d like to write him. Yes… I’ll give you mine. He has a hard time reading. Just write me and I’ll read it to him. Is he okay? He has health issues. Nothing too serious, I hope. It’s… It’s a disease. Sorry, goodbye. Do you agree? Things can’t continue like this. It’s too difficult for you to live alone here. Yes. You can’t find your bearings. You have panic attacks, you feel lost. That’s right. So we must find a solution. Together. Because you’re suffering. Yes. What do you suggest? Moving you somewhere you’ll feel safe, where you’ll be tended to. A hospital stay until a long-term solution is found. You agree, Mr. Kienzler? “Agree”… I find the word a bit abusive. What would be more appropriate? – For Mr. Kienzler? – Yes, here. – You are… – His ex-wife. His companion. His sister, his daughters. His doctor. And Mr. Kienzler. Honey, the paramedics are here. They’ll take you to hospital. I’ll come with you in the ambulance. I’ll stay with you the whole time. Can he walk? He can walk, but not down the stairs. Fine, we’ll use the wheelchair. I’ll pack his bag. We’ll put you in the chair. I have to tell you! I did my first ANV-Cop 21 mission. – What’s that? – A non-violent ecologist group. Lovely. – So? – I took down a portrait of Macron. What? We had to go 3 hours early for non-violence training. They explained the mission wasn’t strictly legal, and we risked 5 years in jail and a 75,000-euro fine. She votes Macron then takes down his portrait. You voted Macron too. With a gun to my head. It wasn’t a vote of approval. Neither was mine. You can be for and against at the same time. It’s complex thought. It’s complex. You can’t understand. We got to City Hall, greeted with open arms. Then we realized we didn’t have the… screwdriver to take it down. We found a hardware store. Then we fled. Except I had a hard time running, with my knees. Excuse me. My father’s been waiting 5 hours. We’ll be right with you. What do they want? Are they Nazis? No, Dad, it’s just the ER. How about Leila? – What’s she up to? – Waiting next door. It mustn’t happen to her too. Nothing will happen to her. I’ll go get her. – See you. – Yes! He’s asking for you. Leila’s with him. I’m going. The babysitter’s waiting. I’m going too. Go on, we’ll stay. Can I take a sip? I saw something on TV about ERs. The United States no longer has ER problems. Ouch. They had an idea: they put ERs in malls. Medical booths with nurses for small emergencies. You have to pay. People go to shop. That way, hospital ERs aren’t overburdened. And hospitals cost a fortune there. I’ll leave you. Me too. Hey. It’s not a bad time? No, quiet day. I wanted to see your workplace. Good thinking. This floor is for terrestrial colleagues. They like rocks. I like rocks too, but ours are smaller. – Low-tech for cutting-edge research. – Disappointing, right? Most analyses are done elsewhere. Here we work our brains and prepare samples for tests. This is the extraterrestrial floor. We leave the world of rational beings. Meet Aurélie. We’ve worked together for 15 years. Sandra, a friend who wanted to visit. – Finish prepping? – I finally adjusted the beam. Notice the MEB’s stabilization problem? You get a good image, adjust it, then lose it. You have to start over. Is your support conducive enough? You’re asking me that? Yes, it was conducive enough. It’s always me doing the last-minute adjustments. Last time it was me. Last time we couldn’t get our bearings with your images. You did a rush job. I’m off. I’ll bring them the sample tonight, seal it. Cross-section tomorrow morning. Goodbye. So this is where you work? It seems relaxed. That depends. Things can get tense. Why? Fear of fucking up an experiment, losing a precious sample, failing to grasp an obvious result. Do you want to see the mass spectrometer? The what? It analyzes matter. Prettiest instrument in the world. I’d love to. Come. It means nothing to you. It’s an ion microprobe. Not the latest model, but it’s what we need. We put samples there, run tests here and images appear on that screen. For example, that micrometeorite shaving is brought here after synchrotron analysis. This machine runs additional tests. Isotopic imaging, for example. Isotopic imaging, of course. I’m off. I told Linn I’d go to her fencing class. Thanks. I thought you were leaving. Not if you kiss me. You kissed me! No way! Never crossed my mind. You’re my friend. Look how you did it, like this. Nonsense! You’re such a liar. – The guy who pounces and… – “The guy”! You want to see how a guy pounces? Let’s see. You often get slammed against walls? – Not by an astrophysicist. – A cosmo-chemist. A cosmo-chemist, sorry. Nope, first time. Can we meet up again soon? We can consider it. You got here late! Sorry, honey. Problem with the subway. You did well. Like a pro. I had no idea he kept so much stuff. Why these miniature cars? He collected them, like the knives. He’ll like having them at hospital. Think they’ll let him walk around with knives? So at least the cars! That pile we left downstairs with the broken furniture… All gone in an hour. Of course. Want his pens? Take them. I don’t use fountain pens. I’ll take this one. – Want this? – No thanks. Come now! This? No, thanks. Come on, make an effort. Who’s taking the sailboat? – Not me. – Me neither. What about the books? I’ll deal with it. I’ll contact his former students. Who’s that? Jérémie’s father. He’s coming for dinner. Why? Why not? It’s for you. Thanks. How nice! A cardboard house. You have to assemble it. The light on the roof is powered by solar energy. There you go. When it’s sunny, put it by the window. Then you can turn it on at night. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mom. Sleep well. Come. I’m thirsty. Come. I’ve forgotten how. You can’t forget. I did. It’s easy. How could this body stay asleep for so long? I have to go. Yes. You seem sad. No, I’m not sad. It’s tough for me, you know? Going for a walk, Dad? It’s Sandra, your daughter. Sandra, honey! Come. Is it raining here, right now? It’s not raining. We’re in your room. Okay. Phew. Are the caregivers nice? Yes, you can say that… Hello Mr. Kienzler. I’ll take your blood pressure. So I don’t get it. Why are we waiting? There are people who talk, talk, talk. We don’t care because… we’re chatting quietly. But there are others here, there… There’s no one else in the room. That’s what’s weird. We’re not in a waiting room. We’re in your room. We’re at Hôtel-Dieu, in your room. You’ve been here a week and I came to visit. Okay. Sometimes there’s a film, like yesterday, another, all that… The films began and… With a beginning, middle, end? Now there’s nothing. That’s what I don’t understand. There’s no program here. But you have visits. It’s a weird feeling. As if something were missing… This feeling is very strong. It weighs on me. Because… I wait for… the thing that should come… And it doesn’t. And the two of us, we don’t even know… when it will stop. Or begin. How long do you have? 2 hours. No time to lose! Shy girl who forgot how to make love. You’re quiet. What are you thinking? I’d never have thought… That I was a sexual creature? That it was possible between us. That I could desire you so much. I didn’t exist. You were my friend. Your friend who patiently saw you home at night, who dried your tears. My friend with a wife and son who never let things show. I didn’t have the right. And now you do? I seized it. Life is short. Not afraid of going astray? You’re very sure of yourself. Not at all. Remember, you kissed me first. What? The nerve of you! The poets I’ll keep. The dictionaries too. You said 2 crates. Now you’re at 8. Who’ll transport them? I’ll manage. Remember this? No. Dad’s friend’s house in the Cévennes. We went a few times. No. You’ve forgotten everything that happened to us from birth to the age of 20. True. I remember my professional life, but my private life… total blackout. You realize the enormity of that? I wasn’t too happy with your father, so forgetting was a way of… getting some distance. What about us? You throw the babies out with the bathwater. Why didn’t you leave him earlier? For you. I was afraid he’d kill himself. Enough suicide in the family. It’s here! We weren’t sure. What will you put them in? Large bags. More are on the way. Great. Hurry up, Sandra is taking the best books. It’s normal, he’s her father. Thanks for reminding her. Romy! What do you want to do? Nothing. Want to go out? Your wife’s away, so you want to go out. Don’t want to? Aren’t we fine here? Making love, eating, sleeping is enough. Not for me. If we never leave the bed, I’ll get bored. So here we are. You’ve had enough. Already. I have a passion for your body, maybe you noticed? But it’s not all I like. I also enjoy talking. Talking? Okay. What about? Don’t be hypersensitive. You want to talk. Go on, I’m all ears. – You’d prefer I only want your ass? – Maybe. Charming. I guess I’m just a sex object for you. No, but unlike you, I haven’t had my fill. I never said I’d had mine. You’re bored. You’re being a pain! I desire you nonstop. What you want to do? Museum? Exhibition? – It’s not insulting. – It is. You’re totally crazy. Come here! Come here, you fury! Yuck! Like them? You’re going to sulk until I leave? Yes. Let’s go back. What for? Guess. Not afraid of getting bored? Come now… It hurts to know you’ll see your wife. I don’t like knowing you lie to her. It’s a nightmare. I try not to burden you. You’re happy with me? So happy! That’s what makes it so hard. I can’t go if you turn me on. Right. I don’t want you to leave. Stay with me. You’ll write? Yes, of course. Don’t forget me. Is there something shiny? It’s the light. – Shall I turn it off? – Yes, I’d like that. What do you see in here? Do you see me? Of course, I see you, yes. What else? Except you… some objects. Obviously. And… you. I mean… your person… and so… How about my dress? Do you see it? Yours? Yes, mine. I see it very well. Can you see the pattern? The flowers? Yes, that’s it. Is my hair short or long? What? My hair. Is it short or long? You have clothing. Look at my face to see my hair. Can you see if it’s short or long? It could be long. It’s short actually. All right. And your children? Are they well? Linn’s at camp. She loves it. She says she doesn’t miss me. It annoys me. She comes back tomorrow and we leave. Elodie rented a place in Normandy. She invited us. So… I won’t see you for two weeks. I’ll see you when I’m back. All right? Yes. Can we play Scrabble? I want to rest. You never play with me! You kidding? You promised Scrabble today. – Steam. – Stem. Destem. That doesn’t exist! It does! What does it mean? It means: “Remove the stem from a cluster of fruit”. That’s cheating! She checks out all the combinations on her phone. Your turn, Mommy. Try to do better. It won’t be easy. SEX COCK Why are you laughing? Stop, you’re cheating! I found something. Exit. 11, 12, 13… – There! – I saw it! I always miss the shooting stars. It was beautiful. – There! – Where? That’s an airplane. Want to know where it’s going? There are no more shooting stars. That one is London-Johannesburg. And that one? Where is Johannesburg? It’s in South Africa. And that one? Tenerife-Amsterdam. I’m going to bed. Can I sleep in your bed? If you want to. Reykjavik-Milan! Can’t you put down your phone? The heat here is overwhelming. I swim every morning at dawn, when the beach is empty. Then I go find Jérémie. He wakes up early too. We go on long walks, never the same. We gather plants. I teach him to recognize them. The rest of the time, I can’t think, read or sleep. When I close my eyes, I see your face. I see your eyes. I want to kiss them. Your mouth. I want to devour it. I want to bite your lips over and over, and slowly move down your neck, your shoulders, still moving down slowly. Your breasts, to cherish them. I love them so. To lose myself in you, my sweet love. My body aches, it hurts. You’re growing. School’s on Monday. Time to sleep. I don’t want to sleep. Mom? There you are. Hello, Dad. The doctor and the social worker harassed me to move him. They found him someplace awful. I screamed at them. They said: “You take him.” I said we divorced 20 years ago. Goodbye, Mr. Kienzler. Goodbye, ma’am. I hope they’ll take good care of you at the new hospital. Yes, thank you. Your father is a lovely man. You’re lucky. Thank you. The Kienzler family? I’ll show you his room. Ma’am? You’re putting him here? She’s dead in the other bed. She’s not dead. She’s fine. Really? If we have no choice. Take a seat. What can you tell me about Mr. Kienzler? He has a neurodegenerative disease, Benson’s Syndrome. He was diagnosed 5 years ago. He was still working. His profession? Philosophy professor. How did it manifest itself? He couldn’t read, but his vision hadn’t deteriorated. He began having difficulty finding his bearings. Simple acts became complicated if not impossible. He became more and more confused. Now he can’t do anything alone. It pained him to accept his brain was going haywire. Because his entire life was devoted to… the act of thinking. Clarity and rigor obsessed him. He tried working to the end! A year ago, he was still working. He memorized his lectures and dictated corrections to his mother, who at 98 is lucid. And to his companion Leila. – He has a companion? – For 5 years. They’re close. She has health issues, so she can’t take him in. May I ask a question? How do you die of this disease? You usually die because you become bedridden. We have another room, if you want. Great. Valérie knows about us. Really? I told her. I couldn’t anymore. What did you say? The truth. That I was in love with you. She was dignified and threw me out. How about your son? He doesn’t know. He must sense something. How did you explain leaving? We said I was going away a few days for work. A few days. And then? Then I don’t know. For now, I’m here. You’ll sleep here tonight? If you’ll have me. Mommy… I’m not alone. Clément is here too. You know what Clément does? No, what? Astrophysicist. Cosmo-chemist! Okay, cosmo-chemist! They’re studying the planets at school. You go into space? That’s astronauts. I stay on earth. But I go to remote areas to collect extraterrestrial dust. It falls all over earth, in oceans, everywhere. It comes from comets or asteroids. They enter the atmosphere, leaving a long trail. Ever see a shooting star? Shooting stars aren’t really stars. They’re little particles of dust a few millimeters long. I look for them, I gather them, and I analyze them here. I know all the planets in the solar system. Go on. Saturn, Uranus, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars. And also… Nep… Neptune! Good job. Now go brush your teeth. There’s Pluto too. But way too small to be a planet. Exactly. Get moving. I’d like it if you can help me so I can I get into a bed. Where I can sleep well. Do you mind? No. It’s not bedtime. It’s 5:30. Yes… no, but it’s not too late. What I’d like is that you… if possible, you come with me briefly and we do something. Or you do… well, whatever you want. And me, you… you’d help me to… To go to bed? Yes, that’s it. To do the right gesture for sleeping. Hello, sir. Excuse me. That’s what I’d like. Because you’re my daughter. And I’d like… for you to help me so that, with that, I fall asleep. I fall asleep. I know that I fall asleep. And I know it’s my family. It’s my daughter who does all that. And so, I’m happy at that moment. You see what I mean? Could you stand that? But… you’d like to go to sleep for a long time? Oh no, no… A short film, a 10-minute film. But it would be a few meters longer. And afterward, you won’t tend to me anymore. Little ghost! Stop! Skull and bones! You’re terrible. Igloo! – Spot! – Of what? Of paint. Candle! Candle… – That little thing! – Spider web! – I said thing! – It’s called a web. I’m here. – What are you doing? – Nothing. I can’t sleep. Someone’s in a good mood. How do you know Clément? He was your dad’s friend, now he’s mine. He can’t be boyfriend and friend. He’s my friend and boyfriend. Don’t overthink it, okay? Work well. See you tonight. What? I tried telling you last night. I couldn’t. I can’t do this. Leave my wife, make my son suffer, I’m not ready. I’m torn, but I have to stop seeing you for now. You knew my situation… And you knew mine. This was never a fling for me. It was never a fling for me either. All right. Enjoy it? It was amazing. I’m glad. Not you? I didn’t love it. You don’t like the story? The story’s fine, but the images, sound… What about it? I found it very aggressive. Not at all. How can kids movies be so violent? You always spoil what I like. I’m sick of it. I can’t have an opinion? – You’re mean. – Mean… What if I always said your taste sucked? I don’t always say that. Give me your hand. And you? How are things? I mean… life. Me? I’m okay. Good. Excuse me, honey… Bathroom? I’ll get someone. – Excuse me. – Yes, ma’am? He needs the bathroom. I’m coming. Thank you. Why not do it yourself? I don’t know. I’m embarrassed. Really? You know, my parents are ill. When I visit, I take them to the bathroom. It’s not complicated. I admire you… I can’t. Come, sir. Give me your hand, lean on me. Nice and slow. It’s a pity, I mean, for you. Make the most of being together. Careful, I’m opening the door. Nice and slow. You’re leaving. Got a minute to talk? Yes. You don’t return the social workers’ calls. Sorry, I forgot. They take it out on me. They want your father out in a week. Fuck. I tried everything. I begged the doctor to keep him longer, in vain. He’s changed his tone since the last time. We’ll put him in a private home until we find better. The only one available is in Courbevoie. Visit it with your sister. Meet the manager, who also keeps calling me. A bed became available and she’s very much… in a rush, to use it. Nice dog. What’s his name? It’s a she. P
