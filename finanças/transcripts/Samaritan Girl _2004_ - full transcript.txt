Presented by SHOW EAST... a KIM KI-DUK FILM production. Wanna meet today? Are you pretty? Of course. Can I see your face? Sure. Do you like what you see? Yeah, I do. How much? How much do you usually pay? It's my first time... How about 200,000 won? Great. We'll decide on the spot. You're not a cop, right? If you're not, then we're not either. There was a prostitute in India named Vasumitra. Vasumitra? What a pretty name. Words say that any man who slept with her, turned into a devoted Buddhist. What the hell did she do to them? She gave a ecstatic sex as a prostitute, I guess. What does sex have to do with Buddhists? Maybe it aroused some deep maternal love. You see, men are like babies when they have sex. Yeo-jin, call me Vasumitra from now on. Close your mouth. Got it? I'm Vasumitra from today on. Isn't that him? Look out for me. -Yeo-jin! How can you laugh? -'Cause it's fun. Stop right there! He stopped chasing us. Wanna eat some pig's feet? Pig's feet? The money? How much do we have now? A little more than one person's airfare. I guess I'll have to meet ten more. Hey, that's dirty. Come on, I was eating it. That guy... Do you know his occupation? Who cares. Have you heard of sensors? Sensors? You've seen those glass doors open when you approach them. They are all sensor-operated. He says he runs a shop that sells those sensors. He said sensors had another use. What was it again? Stop talking nonsense. What's the use knowing what those beasts do? Tell me! Why are you getting mad? I'm just curious about what they do. Even though it's brief, we're still sharing something. It's too dreary if there's only sex. You Vasumitra idiot. Come here. -I'm not dirty. -It's filthy. You don't know anything about those guys. I'm sorry I pulled you into this. Let's stop. I'm scared that this would haunt me forever. It's not even a murder. It's not that hard on me. There is some fun too. And we need more money to buy two tickets to Europe. Let's be patient. You seem like you're enjoying it. Yeo-jin, eat before you go to school. You have a test today. I don't wanna take the test. I won't take it. Let's eat. Do you know that today's your mom's memorial? Did you get the suspect? I'm still investigating. At the Notre Dame Cathedral in Avignon, France. There's a wooden statue of Jesus Christ. The wood is so old and rotted, you can't recognize the face. Even one of his arms is gone. Are you with me? Yes. Then suddenly one day a bud sprouted from the wood. But it has no roots... It's so mysterious, isn't it? The quarry in Misari? At two? Okay. See you there. -Did you set it up? -Yeah. -Misari at two. -Let's go. Don't they say that your voice is different? -Nope. -I feel strange. It's not like I'm the one doing it, but I call and handle the money. I was supposed to do your makeup at the beginning. -Why do you have me do everything? -I'm sorry. I can't do anything without you. No, you're the one who is suffering. Don't ask about their occupations from now on. Okay. Yeo-jin, get in. He's gonna buy us dinner. Today's my mom's memorial. You don't have a mom? If you're done, then go. Get out! Get out now! What's wrong, Yeo-jin? Get out now! What's with you? Am I filthy to you? I said if you're done, then go. You think I'm filthy. Don't you? I'm filthy, huh? What are you looking at? You want me, too? Crazy bastard. Yeo-jin, what's with you? He's a good guy. He's a musician. What's with you? What's wrong with him buying us dinner? How could you eat with him after what he's done to you? -What has he done to me? -They're all filthy bastards! Don't say like that. I'm the one who was with him. He's such a good guy. He even sang for me. There was more than just sex. Damn you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I must've done something wrong again. He just makes me comfortable. That's all. I'm sorry. I won't hurt your feelings again. I won't ask about their occupations either. I'll just I'll just I'll just have sex. I'm sorry. It pisses me off that any guy can touch this beautiful thing. He's not 'any guy'. Do you like that guy? Be honest. I could tell from your eyes. How could you get those feelings in less than an hour? Time isn't important. I'll stop liking him, okay? Which look do you want? How about Indian costume? If you're ready to take your picture. -Press the okay button. -Okay. Vasumitra. Vasumitra. Vasumitra. One, two, three... What are you staring at? What's there to look at, you squirt? You know you did. And you're looking now! You have your clothes on now, there's nothing I can see. Hey, where do you think I'm staring now. Get out of here. Go! Weird kid. Jae-young! Hold on. Come down, girl. It's dangerous over there. Come down, lady! Jae-young, don't! -Don't be scared of us. -No, Jae-young! Come inside. Jae-young, don't! Jae-young! Jae-young, don't! You're gonna get hurt! Hurry down! Come down! We won't hurt you so come down! Jae-young, don't! Jae-young, don't! Jae-young, no! Jae-young! Jae-young. Carry me. Carry me. Where are her parents? I don't have their number. She'll regain consciousness in two hours. Find out their number then, okay? Jae-young. Jae-young. Jae-young. Jae-young. What's your home phone number? Give me my diary. Tell me your number so I can call your parents. Hurry, you're going to die. Diary... -Bring him to me. -Are you crazy? I miss him. Bring him to me, okay? I'm begging you. Jae-young! Jae-young! Jae-young! Did you find out her parents' number? She didn't tell me. Looks like she's not gonna make it tonight. -Nurse! Get the oxygen mask. -Yes. Hello, this is Jae-young. Remember me? Can you come to the hospital now? It's urgent. Wait. Wait, don't hang up. Where are you? My friend's in the hospital. You remember Jae-young, right? You met her not long ago. I know. She wants to see you one last time before she dies. Please come to the hospital with me. It'll take only ten minutes. I wish I could but I can't get myself out of here as you see. I'm far behind the schedule of composing. No, you have to come with me. Jae-young's gonna die soon. You two were together. She's no stranger. Jae-young's gonna die soon. Mister, please. Please come with me. I'm sorry. I can't go with you. I'm also in the middle of something important. Move your hand. I'm recording! I said, move it! Mister, please. I said, move it! Do it fast. The faster we do it, the sooner we go to your friend. She's dying. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Oh my goodness. Doctor! Doctor, please come over here! Doctor! Do you feel any pain? It was your first time. Hurry up and go. Friendship is important, but... Hurry up and go! Jae-young. Jae-young. Stop laughing! What's there to laugh? Stop laughing now. Stop laughing now. Hello? I'm at the hospital. Someone I know died. Well, it's someone I kinda knew. We're not exactly close. Yeah. She died. Jae-young I'll return all this money. That'll make me less sorry for you. Hello? Yes, this is Jae-young. Do you have time today? Yes. Then I'll wait at the motel. Yes. Bye. It's open. You're Jae-young? Yes, I'm the real Jae-young. What are you smiling at? Is there somebody outside? I'm lucky I tell you. I'm lucky to have you. I feel like I'm ten years younger. The hell with morals. Isn't this happiness? Did it feel good as well with Jae-young? It feels exactly the same. The way you two laugh is also same. Jae-young is dead. She jumped off that window, and her head cracked open. Really? What's this for? I'm supposed to give you money. I'm returning it. I don't need it anymore. Thank you. Yoo-jin? It's dad, where are you? Are you in private tutoring? No, I just felt like calling. Shall we eat out for a change? Feels like we're lovers. Aren't we? Shall we date? Thank you for making me happy. I'm more thankful. No, I'm more thankful, seriously. I'm very thankful as well. We all have to live in harmony. By understanding and not hurting one another. I won't take your money. I'll return the money from before, too. Things are easier now, right? I'll pray for you until I die. Hey, don't laugh. That bitch who sponges off my dad always laughs at me. It's a forced laugh. It sucks. Don't laugh, I said. You're pissing me off now. Don't laugh. You know you're not laughing because you feel good. Do I look funny to you? Do I? You're crazy. You really worry me, considering how young you are. Don't touch me. CIS. Get some good shots. Yes, I'm on the spot. The car has gone right now. Mister, what the hell are you doing? Why are you blocking my car? Move your car now. Stop this. How about a punch for every lie we make? -What? -I'll ask first. Where were you just now? Why do I have to answer that to you? One second. Two seconds. I was at a motel with a girl, so what? How old was the girl? One second, two seconds... How old was the girl? One second, two seconds... What the hell are you doing? How old was the girl? One second... Who the hell are you? Two seconds... Who do you think I am? Who do you think I am? Who do you think I am? Who are you? Get the hell out of here. Before I kill you. Why aren't you telling me a foreign topic today? You never listen anyway. I always listened. In a country town in Italy three young girls went to go play in the forest. Suddenly, in the sky. Mother Mary appeared in a blinding light. It was so bright, they all fainted. While they were unconscious, they saw a terrible and grim vision of the world's end. So right as they woke up, they were terrified and told the town preacher. Dad, are you nervous about your life? Do you believe in miracles? I wish a miracle would happen. Why didn't you shave today? I forgot to. You didn't wash your face either. Excuse me. Yes, how may I help you? Are you on your way to meet a young girl? What? You're crazy. What an insult. Excuse me. Are you on your way to meet a young girl? Let's have a drink. I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy. Just one drink. I'm sorry, but who are you? Hello? I'm meeting someone. Hold on, I'll be there soon. If you have nothing to say, I must be going. Thanks for the drink. I'd like for you to go back the way you came. Why aren't you coming? I have to go home by five. Hurry up. You're crying? Did someone die? Hurry over. I'll comfort you. What is it? Your makeup isn't a good match. Take it off. You too. Your earring is in country fashion... What's with the long face? Why'd you call me here if you won't talk? -How was that guy yesterday? -It was a drag. You liked him yesterday. I did at first. But now he sucks. The truth is... This is no fun. Come on! Tell us. Hurry! Tell us. Hey, they look like high school kids to me. But they act like grown women. Hey girls, how old are you? You're not in college, right? How old do I look to you? We're all the same age, so you want to join us? Wanna buy us drinks then? We're all the same age, so why not? You little... -Let's go. -Hold on for a sec. Sweety. You're cuter than I thought. Pick the one who you like out of all of us. Why? Let's go! Come on, Sweety! You. You little brats! I thought we were friends. What's going on? While we were waiting for you guys, for these two snakes stuck their tongues at us, so we were disciplining them. Girls, try to understand. They're just old perverts drooling at you. Hey, wipe your mouth. Watch it, you punks. What are you gonna do about it? Wanna be treated nice? Then don't pick up girls half your age, and get a fucking life. -You punks! -Know where my friend works? No, we don't, so what? Stop it. You should put these little rats behind bars. You really fucking scare me. Stop it. Sons of bitches. Let go. Damn punks. Let go. Stop it! I said stop! What's with you? Why'd you hit me, you bastard? What's wrong with you? Excuse me. Can I have a light? How far are you going? I can walk from here. Hop in. I'll give you a ride. I'm sorry. About what? I'm very sorry. Who do you think I am? I'm very sorry. Please forgive me. Sol, go get the door. Who is it? Mom, someone's here. -Who is it? -I don't know. Who are you? How old are you? -Pardon? -What grade are you in? I'm a sophomore in high school. Aren't you disgusted with yourself? Say something! Who are you to do this? What did my husband do wrong? Why are you letting him hit you? What did you do wrong? Why are you hitting my dad? You're a lunatic! What's wrong? Did you do something bad? Filthy bastard. You sleep with a girl younger than your daughter. Dogs don't even do that. Bastards like you make this world crazy! What kind of lunatic are you? Get out of here! Get the hell out now! What on earth did you do? Tell me. Why'd you just sit back while he hit you? Dad! What are you doing? What are you doing? -Let's go to the hospital. -I'm okay. -Let's go to the hospital! -I'm okay. Damn it. Mister, what are you doing? Get lost! Bastard. Mister, get off now. He must be a lunatic. -You're not getting off? -Oh my god! He must be a lunatic. What should I do? Telephone! Telephone! Why are you hitting? You're crazy. Damn it. Are you out of your mind? Son of a bitch! Fucking bastard. Hello? Hello? Is this the police? I think there was a murder here. -What's the name of this park? -We're new to here. Age? How old? He looks to be around thirty. Want some? Taste good? Yeo-jin, want to go on a trip? Let's go to mom's grave and visit the countryside. -Now? -Yeah. Yeo-jin, sleep. I'll wake you when we reach mom's grave. Yeo-jin, let's eat. Sir. I'd like to ask you something. -Can we stay here for the night? -Where'd you come from? -Pardon? -Where are you from? -Me? -We came from Seoul. Then we have an empty room if you're staying for one night. Over there? Thank you. It's so nice here. My mind feels clearer now. Yeo-jin, if something's bothering you, then let it all go. I bet you two are hungry. Help yourself to some sweet potatoes. -Thank you, sir. -I'm very grateful. Eat as many as you can. Looks delicious. Let's eat. You know Mother Teresa, right? At the Vatican cathedral in Italy. She worked miracles as a woman saint. When Mother Teresa was alive, she cured many by laying her hands on them and praying. The Vatican officially acknowledged the miracles. -Did you sleep well? -Yes, how about yourself? Yes, we did. You probably didn't sleep so well because it wasn't so comfortable. No, thanks to you we rested well. -Have a good trip. -Thank you. -Farewell. -Good-bye. Miss, give me a pack of cigarettes. Do you want to drive? Nope. Try it. No, it's too scary. It's not scary. It's okay. No way. Scaredy cat. Detective Kim? Yes, it's me. Detective Kang? It happened that way. Well, right now we're at... Dad... Grab the steering wheel tight with both hands. This is the accelerator and that's the brakes. Now, go that way. I'm scared. You can do it. Shift it to D. Good, now slowly. Step on the pedal, slowly. Slowly, good. To the left. To the left. Step on the pedal. Slowly, Slowly, slowly, to the left, to the left. Step on the brakes, good. Good! Keep going! Good! Keep going! Good! Keep going! To the left, then brake! Backward a little bit. Shift it to R. Okay, okay. Keep going, good. To the left, then stop. Good job. Good job. Now, you're on your own. Dad's not following you anymore. Dad!
