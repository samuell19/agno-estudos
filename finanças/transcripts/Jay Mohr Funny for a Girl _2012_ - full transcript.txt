- It is. - Is that buddy hackett? Oh, god damn it. You motherfucker. - Go get 'em, baby. - Ant Is brilliant. You're wonderful. I love... You're crazy. - I love ant. I love you. Bob newhart once said to me, "headlining comedians is the second-smallest club, next to living presidents." I always thought that was cool. And him and hackett always said, "it's a brotherhood, man. - You gotta keep it together. - I'll never bad-mouth a comic." He asked me a good question. He said, "does it feel longer? When you're up there, does it feel longer than an hour or less than an hour?" The first ten minutes always feels about double, and then... Then you get to a point where you're not thinking about anything, because... I don't know. The plane took off? How do you explain it? - That a plane takes off? The plane just takes off, but the first ten minutes, you're just chugging down the runway going, "okay, okay. We're good." Look at this, my set list. "New baby, two boys, diapers, adult diapers..." That's where my sister works, right there. Let's give them... Shameless plug. "Ranger Bob's, scottsville, Kentucky." Virginia. That's my sister, Virginia mohr. That's where she holds it down. Let's do it. ♪ ♪ ♪ Make you come home early ♪ ♪ stay out all night long ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage... Jay mohr! Yeah! Thank you! Thanks, very much. Oh, it's great. Hello! Yes. Yes! Oh, goodness gracious, San Bernardino. Oh! Thank you for coming. This is already tremendous. I love you too. This is great. Now I know why comics are doing specials. You come out, and there's a great audience, and you have a great fucking time. I don't know why I waited so long. Thank you for coming. La raza! For those of you watching at home, you know, this might be November, and you're in your house watching, you know, Jay mohr on showtime, but you don't realize it's August in San Bernardino, and it's 114 degrees inside. It is hot. I put baby powder down my pants when I left my hotel. When I got out of the car, pancakes fell out of the cuff of my pants. I have salmon swimming up the crack of my ass right now. That's how hot... It's hot, I tell you. Uh, I may forget some stuff as we go. I have a new baby at home, so forgive me, I'm a little out of it. I don't sleep mu... Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. I got two boys, eight years apart. There's really, uh... That's not a good age difference at all. There's nothing you can do with them at all together. 'Cause one wants to shoot hoops, and the other one, you just stare at all day watching him try to take a shit. That's all babies do, is try to grind one out. Six straight hours of just, unh! Crying. Turning red. Babies can't shit. I don't know why. You put a baby in a car seat... Remember when Elmer Fudd would get super mad, and he would turn, like, red, and purple, and plaid? That's my baby. I put him in the car seat, and he just turns into the incredible hulk. Unh! Unnh! 'Cause he can't shit. Can you imagine... he cries. Can you imagine having to take a shit so bad that you cry? Come on. That's a lot of Vicodin, and imodium, and cheese. You have to shit so bad, you're on the toilet crying. People come in from another room, with their bathrobes. What's going on? You want me to help? Give me your feet. Push on my hands with your feet. Go like, unh! And you're, aha-ha! Oh, ho-ho! My four-month-old son just cannot shit, and I don't understand, because it's only 9 inches from his throat to his asshole. What's the hold up, little man? If I have a shrimp cocktail from room service, I'm running to the toilet in 22 minutes. This guy is having, like, enfamil super sensitive fussiness formula. Unh-oh! And he's looking at me like, you motherfucker! Make me shit! You're the fucking grown-up! Aah! Whoa. I didn't know you could talk, bro, relax. That's all they do is, they just try to poop. And then they do poop, and they're never done pooping when you think they're done pooping. 'Cause I'm a diaper changer. We, guys, my... I'm 41 years old, we're the first generation of "I love you" dads. Dads that are hands-on, taking the kids to the park, changing the diapers. You change a diaper 'cause it's filled with mud. It is filled, overflowing. That little baby elmo picture on the front, he's crying, like, yeah, fucking take me off of this... this is disgusting! Kermit the frog, like, hi-ho, Kermit the frog... Get me the fuck out of this baby. I don't know if Kermit would swear, but... You take his diaper off, and... just more shit comes out. He just thinks it's funny. And it comes out in, like, a perfect little tube. Like, there's a snake charmer behind... ♪ Na na neer ner ♪ It just comes out. And it... you know what it reminds me of? It looks exactly like when we were kids, the play-doh factory. When you'd make the play-doh come out like that. And all I could think of was I would pay $5,000 right now if I had that play-doh factory ruler to press shapes up against his tiny asshole. And just have, like, the star... Yes, sir! The star comes out, you've got... A little star tube. Honey, come in here, we're making spaghetti! We got him circumcised about three months ago. Uh, little traumatic, little weird. I had to be in the room with him, and he's holding my hand the whole time, and he's looking at me like, are you fucking... really? Really, this is best for me? Okay. Let me tell you something. This is the only time this has ever been a compliment in the world. The doctor, while circumcising my son, said, he has the penis of a two-year-old. I said, so do I. Why do you think it took me eight years between kids? I'm not exactly putting the mail in the mail slot. I'm hung like a light switch. It's a miracle he's here at all. You know, the best part about having a baby... Carpool Lane. That really is the overlooked reason to have a child. Because you forget that that tiny baby counts as a human being, 'cause it says two or more people are allowed, and you sit there. You put your baby in the car seat, and it's not fair, 'cause the baby can't face the front like a person. He's gotta face the back, like he's on a southwest flight. He can't, you know... And so that your baby can see you, you put... He's facing this way, you put, like, a mirror on the headrest here, right? And then he looks at himself in his little mirror, and then while you're driving, you set your mirror up to connect with his mirror, and you look at each other in this, like, fifth dimension you've just created. Then you rear-end a cop. You forget. You're in traffic, just eating your own ass for, like, an hour and a half, and you're talking to the baby going, look at this traffic, little man. This is bullshit. Look at everybody in the carpool Lane. They're just beeping, giving you the finger as they go by. Ah ha ha haa! And you look at the sign and you go, two or more peop... Oh, my god, you're a person! It never dawned on me you were a human being. You're just this little tiny shit machine. I didn't know that. Then you just get on over. ♪ Get your motor runnin' ♪ You have a baby, you got to start buying diapers, again. I don't know what diapers come in. I don't know if they come in a box. Do they come in a bag? Do you wrap 'em up in twine? Do you... do you sell them by the cord like firewood? I'm not sure... How diapers operate. And I kept coming home with no diapers, because I thought the baby on the diaper bag had to match the baby you had at home. This happened two times. I came back from Ralph's, the supermarket, and I said to my wife, all they got are Korean and black baby diapers. And she... she's like, are you a fucking idiot? She didn't... that's what... I could tell by the way she said, really? But, she wanted to say, are you a fucking idiot? Go... Because I don't know if different races have different diapers. Like the black diaper, you know, you let a little out in the front, just... There are so many kinds of diapers. You guys don't even know. You go to the market, there's an entire aisle of diapers. If you have diarrhea, there's just a diarrhea section in an aisle. If you want a diaper, there... Aisle six, diapers, from the front of the store to the back of the store. And there are more kinds of diapers than you had any idea. Huggies one through six, huggies seven for a big fat baby, huggies overnights, huggies with wings, if your kid's gay. Incroyable. I saw a bag of diapers... I'm not making this up... It said, I shit you not... Ha ha ha... terrible. Listen to me. Hey, focus. I saw a bag of diapers. It said, holds up to 35 pounds. If you have a... Child... I guess, you would call it a child. I would call it a fucking wolfman baby, but if you... Thank you. If you have a child werewolf baby at home that goes to the bathroom and unloads 35 pounds, he doesn't need a diaper, he needs a fucking job, okay? Get him down to the docks. Get him a nice union job... What do you got, like a 19-year-old at home? He's captain of the football team, shitting his pants? What, huggies 42s? You know what is always fascinating, when you buy diapers, they have adult diapers right next to baby diapers. There's a... there are all these baby diapers, and then right at the end, like, depends, and whatever the other ones are called. And every time you look at the adult diapers, and you say, that's not a bad idea. I would never get up from my seat at work ever agai... I would get so much work done if I could just put... I would nev... I could drive to Vegas and never have to fucking pull over, if I could just wear an adult diaper. I could sleep the entire flight to Australia. I would just piss and shit myself, and just change my dia... Just switch out diapers halfway over the Atlantic. Pacific, however you get there. I think it's equal, no matter which way you go. You know, it's amazing, my son, my oldest boy Jackie, he took a very long time to get potty trained. And every time you went to lower him onto the toilet, he would lift his knees up like bugs bunny. His knees would be over his head, and we... he was like a narrow-assed kid, and we'd try to lower his ass into the... onto the seat, but it would go through the cylinder, that's how thin he was, and his balls and ass would touch the water, and he would start screaming. And I'm like... I said to my wife, I don't get it. Why doesn't this kid want to be potty trained? And my wife says, maybe it just feels great to piss in a diaper. At that moment, we both knew we were going to try adult diapers. And we did. We went to the store. The baby was at his grandparents'. And we walk into the market like complete potheads, giggling like we're just stoned, like... And we just go just for adult diapers, and we walk out with adult diapers and one coke zero, like... We look like meth heads. Like, we just... yeah. We don't want to stop cooking meth at all, we just want to be out there cooking all night. I don't want to have to take a shit in the middle of my meth cooking. Just give me a diaper, and get my coke zero! We're just tweaking our balls off, laughing like we're on mushrooms like idiots. They check US out, we go home, and we put on adult diapers. And I have to tell you... I don't know if you guys realize this, I don't know if you've ever had to wear one... hopefully not... They're amazing. If I had one on right now, you would not know it. You would think an adult diaper would be like jamming a life preserver down your pants. It would be disgusting and cumbersome... no. They fit beautifully, like regular underwear. I'm telling... If I had one on right now, you wouldn't even know. That's how beautifully done and perfect they are. And we're laughing our faces off in the house, just laughing like we're tripping our balls off, and I look at my wife, I go, you don't even understand. The funniest part about this is it's a joke, we're laughing, but it's only a joke for two people. And my wife goes, that's not the funniest part. I go, what? She goes, the funniest part is, I'm peeing right now. For like a minute, she's just... I was jealous. I watch a lot of law & order. That really is what marriage boils down to... Life is boring, okay? When you stop bullshitting out in the clubs and going everywhere and getting in fights, you got to find someone you love being bored with. And I wish you my kind of happiness, where on a Friday night, you're laying in bed in your pajamas with, like, oatmeal cookies, going, oh, it's a good law & order with Jerry orbach. Yes. Yes! This is life, and it's beautiful, and I wish it for you. You may be going, don't wish that shit on me. I'm out partying, hoofing it. Leave me alone, slammy. You ever see that law & order for... where ice-t has to go undercover... There's... there's no segues in my show. I don't know if you've noticed. And I don't really have an act. We're just gonna jump off a cliff together. We'll build our wings on the way down, if that's okay with you. I don't want to structure this shit out too much. Let's just talk. And everything I tell you is true, okay? You ever see the law & order episode where ice-t has to go undercover to break up a ring of gay black athletes? Yes? Yes! It's the strangest episode ever. It's like somehow, like, the star quarterback is having sex with, like, another team's star running back, and Sam waterston's like, is that what we're doing, your honor? You know, Sam... and, what? I think that's my first time doing Sam waterston. Every time Sam waterston... Jack McCoy... would get upset, he'd wiggle his bangs at the judge, your honor, is that what we're doing with the constitution? Blowing our noses with it, and letting quarterbacks have butt sex with running backs, your honor? So they send ice-t, being the only black person on the show, to go undercover to break up the gay black athlete ring. I don't even know what the crime was, but I'm riveted. I'm glued to the TV. I gotta see how this plays out. Is ice-t gonna wind up, like, blowing a guy? He's #.G., original gangsta. They're gonna wind up tricking for him? Like, I don't know what's happening. So, like halfway through the show, they have all photos of, like, all-pro athletes, football guys, up on the big board in the squad room, and ice-t just walks in with a floor-length leather coat, and he points to one of the guys, he goes, yeah, Jesse mcdaniels? He's on the down-low. And then he fucking leaves. He's done. Like, that's his undercover work for the episode. There's no recordings, there's no paperwork, he didn't take any photographs, he doesn't give... He just walks in, he's on the down-low. I don't have an ending for that. It just popped into my head, 'cause I was watching law & order. I have two boys, like I said. I got a baby, 4 1/2 months old, I got an 8-year-old. My 8-year-old may be a... 1/4 gay, maybe. And if you have a child between the ages... A boy child between the ages of 1 and 13, he's 1/4 gay too. Don't look at me like I just said some wacky shit. Every boy is the gayest thing in the world until they turn that corner. 1/4 gay. They are. And you know what? We... all... I'm still 1/4 gay. I swear to go... I did a movie with Keanu Reeves and forest Whitaker called street kings, okay? And Keanu reev... Yeah. Oh, yeah! Sure, like, you saw it in the theater. Nice try. Listen... Keanu Reeves is so beautiful. This guy took me out of my game. I sat between... And he's not gay. You just wish he was gay, 'cause your wife would fuck him in front of you, and it's true. And so would I. I would fuck Keanu Reeves in front of you. I don't... I wouldn't even care if you had a problem with it. I'd come to your house, I'd say, it's me... I think you know Keanu, and we would just come in, and we would just do wonderful things to each other on your couch while watching bravo. Keanu Reeves is so handsome and gorgeous, he took me out of my game. We're literally between, like, takes three and four in the movie, and I'm just sitting in a chair... I was on a desk. I'm sitting on a desk, in a squad room, looking at Keanu, and I'm just thinking to myself, this motherfucker's beautiful. I don't... he's, like, exotic. Is he Hawaiian, or... He could be anything. He's just... look at... His lips, he's... action! What? That's that 1/4 gay. It comes in, all the time. Don't act like when you see pictures of Beckham with his shirt off you're not like, who's this guy? You know you do. Or you don't. Maybe it's just me. I don't care. You don't think your son's 1/4 gay? I know he is. You know how I know? 'Cause I coached little league. I've seen every 7 and 8-year-old in California run to first base, and they run like little men, 'cause that's the part they've rehearsed over and over and over. The second you tell a 7 or an 8-year-old, go to second base! Go! The wheels fall off. Oh-hoo! Ah-hoo. Their hat flies off, they go back and get it. I got an 8-year-old standing on second base, tucking his hair behind his ears. Oh-ho-ho. ♪ Get down on it, get... ♪ I'm like, how the fuck does he know the words to that song? Ever have a sleepover with your son's friends? That's the gayest shit that will ever happen in your house. You hear them all night long. You set up, like, a tent in your living room, and you just... Hee hee hee hee hee. They zip the windows of the tent closed. You come down and check on 'em, they're wearing each other's pajamas. My son's wearing spongebob bottoms and a lightning McQueen top, neither of which he went to bed in. I put him to bed as a New York jet. I put Wayne chrebet to bed, and all of a sudden, he's got spongebob bottoms, lightning McQueen top, and they're all mixed and matched. One kid's got no shirt on at all. He's outside the tent, hustling. He just hopes company comes over. He wants to fucking party. Like a little Tracy Morgan. I'ma get everybody pregnant. Where's your father? Get your father down here! We gon' get everybody pregnant. Boy pregnant! They wake you up with very gay problems. Daddy? Yeah. Tommy's punching US in the penis too hard. You tell Tommy I said knock it off. Okay, thanks, dad. And he runs out of the room. I try to go back to bed, but I can't, because as I'm laying there with my eyes closed, I can only think of two words. Too hard? What do you mean, "Tommy's punching US in the penis 'too hard?'" you know... you know when you go camping with your buddies, and you're punching each other in the dicks, having a good time? You know. You know when you're out with your pal, like, you're driving and you're halfway through, you know, riverside, and you reach over, you just start punching him in his dick? Just goofing off... And he reach over and starts punching you in your... Tommy doesn't do it right! It's like, hey, Tommy, we get it, you're a top. Relax, okay? You're in charge. Tommy is ruining the sleepover, 'cause he's not punching US in the dicks the right way. I fall asleep anyway, 'cause I don't care enough about their shenanigans to stay up. I don't know if you've ever been woken up by someone else's kid, but that will scare the shit out of you. 'Cause, whenever you look... Your own kids will scare the shit out of... like, when they come to you at 4:00 in the morning like, daddy? You're like, whoa, god! You grab them by the throat, and you're like, oh, this is bad. You got to put 'em to bed, give 'em, like, four Benadryl strips, tell him it was a horrib... That was a bad dream you had... Where daddy grabbed you by the throat. Benadryl is like Jagermeister to five-year-olds, in case you're wondering. ♪ A mother's little helper ♪ I hear, "Mr. Mohr? Mr. Mohr? Mr. Mohr?" And I look over, and it's that kid with his fucking shirt off. He's standing next to my bed. Mr. Mohr, and I'm like, hey, it ain't that kind of party, little man. And I... I'm waiting for Chris Hansen to walk out of my master bathroom. Why don't you have a seat right over there? To catch a predator, that is the best show on television. It's a great show because they catch predators. But it's also a fascinating show to me because the two most important things Chris Hansen has to say is the word "seat," 'cause he tells each sex offender, have a seat over there, and... he has to say the word sex, but neither one he can pronounce. He comes out, he goes, "why don't you have a 'sheat' right over there?" - "It 'shounded' like. - You came here. Because you wanted to have 'shex.'" and the child molester's like, I don't know what the fuck you're saying, sorry. Are you Tom brokaw? Why do you talk like that? Every guy on to catch a predator says the same thing. I'm here to save him. I came here... on the Internet, I was talking to him. He's 14, and I came... And then the cameras come out, and they're like, no, no, no. I'm here to save his life. He shouldn't be on the Internet, soliciting se... And Chris Hansen's like, did you bring the wine coolers? And he's like, yeah, I got 'em right here, but that's not... Listen, let's not get off track here. I'm here... Did you bring your condoms? Yeah. Yeah, they're right next to the wine coolers, but I came here to save his life. Where's that one psychopath predator... we know he's out there... when Chris Hansen goes, - "why don't you have a 'sheat' - right over there?" The guy goes, are you his dad? You're cool with this? I came here to fuck a 14-year-old, are we good? These cookies are amazing, by the way. I don't know if you know your son can bake. Oh, cameras? Holy shit, did I just hit the fetish jackpot? Are you out of your minds? - "It 'sheems' like you came here. - For 'shex'." Yeah, I want to fuck a 14-year-old. Where is he? What are you doing here? No, they all wiggle their way out of it. I got way off track. The kid goes, Mr. Mohr? Mr. Mohr? He's got no shirt on. I go, what is it? He goes, "Jesse peed on US." And I look, and this kid has a giant piss stain on his quad. Now, this isn't a "tell him to knock it off" problem. You got to go down there and do some hands on, upper management work, if you got kids peeing on each other, right? I go downstairs, all the kids are outside the tent, and they're acting like grown-ups, like, finally. Like how you act, or I act, like, when the I.T. Guy is late coming to fix the computers in your office, like, "oh, yeah, I didn't know between 9:00 and 5:00" - "meant 5:15. - Yeah, thanks for stopping by. I'm covered in piss. Thanks for coming downstairs." They're all outside the tent, in their mix and matched pajamas, and they all have giant spots of piss on them. Jesse's in the tent, in his own pajamas. He's sleeping like a baby. And they're pointing at him. I'm like, "yeah, I get it." Jesse's family just moved from long island, and I think his father's a legitimate businessman. Jesse's ten. He's a little old for this crew. I pull him out by his feet, and on the little tent in the living room, it made a great sound. Just pajamas on that fucking tent floor... zzzt! And Jesse stands up, and he comes up to, like, here on me, and I'm like, "oh, shit." And I go, "Jesse, did you just pee on them?" And Jesse goes, "yeah." Like, this kid's ready to fucking throw, right? And in my mind I'm like, "don't back down, don't back down. Be a man. Show them you're a man!" I go, why did you pee on them? He goes, "'cause I go to use the bathroom", - "and they all come in behind me." - And they start. - Tickling my back." - I'm like, "I don't want to hear. "The end of this story." This is the gayest shit I've ever heard in my life. If you guys were covered in glitter, roller-skating around the house waving rainbow flags, that would be half as gay as what you just said. I hope my son is gay. I'll be honest with you right now. God bless him. I would be so happy and proud that he was mine and my wife's and not some asshole family that would try and yell and beat it out of him. I'll tell you one thing, if he's my son and he's gay, we're gonna have one rule. You're gonna come out of the closet early, and you're gonna be real gay. I don't want, like, you in a suit and glasses acting cool gay like Tim gunn on runway. I want you in a fucking cape. I want hermes sneakers, Louis Vuitton backpack, roller-skating to school, with Anita baker on the headphones. If you're gonna be gay, mean it. And I'll be like, that's my son! Look how gay he is! My son, today, just tested for his green belt, and got it. Eight years old, youngest green belt ever given out in that dojo, okay? So he can fight. He's a tough guy, and he can fight. And I wrestled, so I can teach him the ground game, so my dream is that, if he is gay, I would put him in the u.F.C. As the first openly gay fighter. He'd be 40-0, all forfeits. He'd be at the weigh-in, in his little tighty-whitey underpants, just stepping on the scale with half a boner. ♪ 179! ♪ I like your bangs. See you in the octagon. Ground and pound. I did a movie once, up in San Francisco, and my wife and I and my son were driving up the 5 freeway from L.A. to San Francisco, and that is just a balls-across-your-nose drive. There's nothing to do. We listened to every single thing on my iPod that there is to listen to... Black crowes, Beastie Boys, Alice in chains, rolling stones, Beatles, bad brains, Van halen, all of it, bro. Wu-tang, forever, #.D.B.! ♪ Shimmy shimmy yeah shimmy ♪ All of it. My son's in the back with a video game, his eyes melting out of his head. He has no idea what's happening. Once they get the video game in their head, they just turn into zombies. And you can ask them questions, and they're not there. You're like, "hey, man, you want something to eat?" And he'll go, "no, I went before we left the house." And I keep playing al gree... All this different music, 'cause I'm waiting to see if he Bobs his head a little, trying to get a vibe on what he likes. Nothing. Nothing makes him move a muscle. Four hours, at...

The first song on Rufus Wainwright singing Judy garland is... ♪ Clang clang clang goes the trolley ♪ ♪ ring ring ring goes the bell ♪ My son looks up from the back seat, and he goes, "who's this?" "Who is this?" Swear to god. My wife looks across the truck at me, and she goes, he's on the down-low. All true. If I had to rename my boys, I would rename them cock and "block." While sex doesn't necessarily end, it certainly gets compromised in the way you do it. Like, when they're one, and they can sit up in the tub, you just go right around the corner and you learn how to have sex super fast, standing up in the hallway. You're like rodeo people, like, "time?" Time, eight seconds! Whoo. Whoo! Eight seconds! And then you got to hit that switch and walk back into the bathroom. How's your bath? You can never just go back to your old ways of just show fucking. Like, when you're just doing it, looking at yourself in the closet mirror, going, "yeah!" It's all, like, viet cong tunnel rat style, like, you unroll her pajamas. It takes you, like, 45 minutes, 'cause they can hear you unrolling, like, sweatpants in bed. And then you kind of sneak up behind her. She's like, oh, yeah, okay, and she arch... she sticks it out a little bit. And you're just poking her in the back, because, let's face it, isn't a vagina a foot lower than you think it is? Every time, is what surprises me. You remember the first time you put your hand down a girl's pants, guys, or lesbians? Do you remember? You've got your hand all the way down her pants, you haven't even touched hair yet, and you're like, "maybe something's wrong with her." I'll just keep going." And then finally, you hit it, and you're like, "oh, my god," - that's right next to her. - Asshole. What happened to her? Eeh! - Did your parachute not open? - What happened to you? Were you... were you in a car accident? 'Cause your vagina is right next to your asshole. We think, your... Like, our penises... - Now, I'm wearing a wetsuit. - And four pairs of underwear, And I'm very soft, and it's cold up here. Our penises are here. We think that's where your hole is. No. Your hole is where our balls end. That's like a foot. - So you unroll the sweatpants, - and you're poking her. In her vertebrae... - And she's accommodating. - And nice, - "Like, whenever you get" - around to it, I'm good. "It's a... it's a... you know. It's a Jerry orbach one. I'm fine." Ooh. And then when you finally are inside, you're not even enjoying it, 'cause the two of you are just staring at the doorknob... Of your bed, and looking underneath for their little, creepy feet. That's where I look. I think she looks at the door. Nah, I don't think she looks at anything, I think she just has sex, but I'm too paranoid. I'm glad I had boys first, 'cause they can prepare you for having a real child, a girl, because girls, you have to, like, really parent a girl. Boys you can make a lot more mistakes with. You can lie. Two boys, just running down the steps. Daddy, can we watch TV? And you're like, we don't have a TV. He goes, "oh, okay." He turns around to run up, but the other one's still running down. They smash their faces together. They're unconscious for two hours, so then you smoke a bowl and play Madden. Not me, you. Boys are dumb as bags of hair. A little girl knows you have a TV. She has the receipt from when you bought your TV. It's in her office, in her bedroom, in her hello kitty trapper keeper. It's alphabetized, and she goes, "I know we have a TV, because the salesman" was African-American, - "and you didn't get. - The extended warranty. Because you were intimidated by his muscles." And she's right. Little girls are always right, just like women. Your wife, when you argue, she's right. I see you shaking your head no. Trust me, brother. Happy wife, happy life. I met my wife... and I was an asshole my entire life... And I always had this one motto, my way or the fucking highway, that's it. Everybody does it my way, or they're out. And then when I was with my wife, about four months went by, and I realized there was no laundry done, there's, like, shit stains in my underwear, I'm making, like, Turkey patties and grilled cheese, and then finally, I looked at her and I went, what's your way? Her way is awesome! Dishes go in the dishwasher. Dishes don't go in the sink, they go in this thing, the dishwasher, right next to the sink. It's magical. Guys are like, man, fuck him. Women do weird stuff. They get ready for bed. Guys don't get ready for bed. We just lay down and sleep happens. We have no idea what you're talking about. A woman will say, what are you doing? And you're like, I'm watching sportscenter. And she'll go, "again?" And you'll go, "yeah. Why... what?" "And the exact sportscenter is gonna replay after this one, and then I'm gonna watch that one also." And she'll say, "okay, I'm gonna go get ready for bed." Don't think you gotta pound a michelob and join her right away. You still got a good 45 minutes before she's in pajamas. 'Cause women get ready for bed. How do you get ready for bed? You get ready for a marathon, you get ready for the Olympics, you get ready for a prizefight, you get ready for your s.A.T.S. You don't get ready for bed. But then, in they go. Women are in the bathroom, they close the door, they lock it, they leave the faucet running. If you knock, they don't answer. And if you put your ear to the door, it sounds like the pit crew at the indy 500's in there with her. ♪ Clang clang clang goes the trolley ♪ ♪ ring ring ♪ Ladies, I don't know how to tell you this, but when you come out of the bathroom, 45 minutes, you look exactly the same. Guys don't get ready for bed. We just pass out. Women get ready for bed, but they also have to get the nightstand ready for bed. Anything that might happen in the next nine hours has to be accounted for on the nightstand. There's not... you'll sit there going, "are you ready?" And they're like, "wait, need my water... Tissues, right here." "The new people. Chapstick." Can't go to bed without chapstick. I don't know why that is, but for some reason, ladies cannot close their eyes at night unless they put the chapst... Like, are you afraid you're gonna have a dream about the desert, and wake up, "oh, my god!" "Thank god this has s.P.F. I had a dream about the desert," and if I didn't put this on, "it would have burnt my lips off." Guys lay down, and when we wake up, 14, 15 hours later, right next to the bed, in the exact order we took them off, shoes, socks, pants, underpants, t-shirt, jacket. Stop asking US, "why don't you pick up your clothes?" I'm not done with them. I've had these pants on since Wednesday. Boys are dumb. When you have a boy, you have to walk him through every moment of his day. Your son will be in the bathtub, and you'll say to him, "okay, get out of the tub and put on your pajamas, okay?" He goes, "okay," and then you leave his room and realize, "oh, shit, I forgot to tell him to dry his body." And you run back in, but it's too late. You have a soaking wet swamp thing jamming his little, wet carcass into his Diego jammies. Two legs in one leg hole, like an idiot. These don't fit me no more! When I pick my son up from school... And I cannot emphasize to you enough, my boy is a special, great guy. Sensitive, kind, caring. Green belt... He can kick some ass. He's awesome. And when I pick him up from school, I'm always excited to see him at the end of the day, but when he gets in the truck, I'll go, "how was your day?" And he just looks up and goes, What? But he says it like, how did you know it was day? - "What did you do. - At school today?" It's hard to say. That's what he said to me once. - "What did you learn. - At school today?" It's hard to say. He can't do his seat belt, 'cause he doesn't realize he's still wearing his fucking backpack. Oh, god! - "What'd you learn. - In school today?" "What? It's hard to say." And I don't understand why he's so defeated. 'Cause every morning starts with such hope. I get up at about 6:00. I make my coffee. I wake him up at about 6:15, and every time I wake him up, he goes, "eee, eee!" And he makes... I'm like, "whoa! Whoa!" He goes, "is it morning time?" I go, "yes." And he goes, how many in a row is that? I'm like, who's giving I.S.D. To my child? They're all in a row, Stephen hawkings. Do you really want to go through this? How time operates? It's a human invention. We couldn't figure out how long it was until we saw the other cavemen, so we created... Ah, fuck it. It's morning time. And we have breakfast and we drive to school together. And we have great conversations on the way to school. And now that he's eight, he sits in the front seat. And that's a big moment for a father and a son, when you're no longer looking in that mirror. When he's just sitting right next to you. It's pretty cool. And it's also very odd, because the only time there's a guy in that seat, in my truck, we're usually sharing a joint. It's either my wife, or me and a buddy on the way to a dodger game, like, "yeah, kershaw." And I look over and there's an eight-year-old, and I'm like, "there's no way he's holding, right?" And I just keep looking at his backpack. So many zippers. We get to school, and he gets out of the truck. We kiss... On the mouth, big hug. Listen, this is a kid that doesn't care what his friends see. A lot of kids will make you drop 'em off around the corner. They don't want to be seen with you. Me and my son, we kiss, we hug. He gets out of the truck and every morning, he takes off, and I go, hey, wait a minute. And he looks at me, and I go, "be a leader today. Be a leader, okay?" He goes, "I will, daddy." And he fucking runs into school! Like he's in a rocky movie. ♪ Rising up ♪ ♪ back on the streets ♪ ♪ private school took my chances ♪ And I watch him run into school. Six hours later... A young John mccain gets into my truck. I don't know what happened. He comes out of school. He's super skinny. He has a hole in his shirt that I know he put there himself. He's covered in ink. His hair's all fucked up. Big, purple circles under his eyes. The sun is kicking his ass. And he's, like, nervous as to whether or not he should get in the truck with me. He's like, "ahh?" And then he gets in, and I go, how was your day? "What? It's hard to say." What's going on in there? That's why I want a girl. Little girls, they work inverse to the way boys operate. They'll be little bitches all morning long. They'll just talk shit to you, like, "Uh, yeah", "why don't you have more coffee? Give yourself diarrhea, duh! You're so stupid." - "Yeah, if you're gonna." - Make my lunch, - Maybe don't give me fruit" - that's bruised, okay? People think we're hillbillies." Little girls are brutal. They will kick your ass. They say the meanest shit ever, and it's always true, and they never waste it. They wait until the most people are around. Like, a little boy... my son... I'll go, "do your homework." Do your homework." And he goes, "all right, jeez! You're such an idiot!" And I'll go, what did you say? And he'll go, "what?" I go, "did you just call me an idiot?" And my son goes, who called you an idiot? I'll be, "you just said..." he goes, "I don't understand? Why are we talking louder?" Little girls wait till you have, like, all your friends over for your fantasy football draft. And you're like, could you not stand there? And she's like, "how do you even know I'm yours?" And all your friends are just looking down. - "Don't... don't look up. - She'll... you'll be next. Don't look at her." "If you look at her, she'll attack." A little girl will be bitchy all morning, but then when you pick her up in the afternoon, she's gonna have something that I need, personally. Information. It's like the real housewives of Santa Monica. You get a little girl, you put her into a school, by the time... Your daughter knows everything that's happening in your neighborhood. She knows what neighbor quit smoking, but he's sneaking cigarettes out on his deck. She knows who shoved his wife down a flight of steps. She knows what kid is in a remedial tutor class after school. They know everything. Everything, and they can't wait to dish and gossip. That's what I need. - "I don't know. - It's hard to say." No, I want that little girl to hop in my truck, and they start talking shit before the seatbelt is even clicked. She just gets in, "daddy, remember my friend Claire?" "The one that's too fat to wear leggings, but she wears leggings anyway," and she has, like, a sausage body?" I'll be like, "I do remember Claire, what happened?" "Claire got a concussion at McDonald's eating meat." I'd be like, "get the fuck out of here. That's just... """ I wouldn't even go in my driveway. I would keep circling the block to hear the rest of that. Damn it. You can be more authoritative with boys. If you have, like, four boys, you can go, hey, all you guys, out! Get out of the house! Don't even come back in until I call you! That's how mad I am right now. And they'll leave. They don't even know they're in trouble. They're like, "okay." The baby is naked. You're so angry, you let a naked baby walk out of your house. And you're like, I should put some clothes on... Fuck him. Two hours go by, you go, all right, guys, bring it in! And here comes your little troop up the street. Looks like they're coming back from a civil war reenactment. Boys have an amazing ability to get into shit you never knew you could get into. They're all soaking wet from here down. Your oldest son is holding dog shit in his hands. Making a dog shit snowball. The baby's dragging a prosthetic leg up the street. Don't ask 'em where they were, 'cause they don't know. They're dumb. Try that with four girls. It ain't gonna work out so good. All four of you little ladies get out of the house, and don't come back in until I call you! They'll vote as a block. They'll get together and go, "why don't you get out of the house? We all voted, and you're the least popular person in it." And they're right. Said, "you better watch it, little lady, okay?" You wonder why I get annoyed." And she'll go, "and you wonder why mommy drinks in the garage." You're like, "whoa, whoa, mommy doesn't drink in the garage. That's just where her cell phone gets the best reception." My favorite show CSI Miami. I love it. I love David caruso. It's the most fascinating thing to watch on television. Miami, okay? His character's name... Follow me here... is Horatio. Miami is filled with Cubans, and the man's name is Horatio. Was Jimmy smits' phone off the hook when they put this show together? Did Andy Garcia turn it down? I don't think when the writer wrote... Horatio caine... I don't think he thought there'd be a fucking orange haired man with freckles and blue veins wearing s.P.F. 55, playing... Don't fuck with US, eh, homey? This is a homicide, homes. That's fucked up. But... But they hit the jackpot, because they got David caruso, who, in my memory banks, is the only actor in the history of acting that has learned how to act and talk in slow motion, while everyone around him walks in regular speed. Everyone's, like, walking around, bagging evidence, doing chalk outlines, and caruso just comes in, super fucking slow. Says some amazing shit at the beginning of the show. There'll be a dead body in the passenger seat of the car. The steering wheel's missing. They open the trunk of the car. There's another dead body holding the steering wheel, and you're at home going, this is a good caper. I like this. And then David caruso goes, "Well, frank... I guess this is what happens" when the driven "get taken for a ride." ♪ Bwow! Boom boom! ♪ ♪ Fighting in the streets ♪ It's fascinating. Of course, we're gonna watch the show. They play the who every time. It's one of the best songs ever. "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss." Has that ever been more relevant than today? No. Do you think when Pete townshend wrote it, he'd have, like, a ginger cop saying that shit on CBS? Probably not. "Well, frank... Never judge a book... By its cover." ♪ Bwow! ♪ ♪ Bom! Bom! ♪ I'm pretty sure anybody could have pulled that part off and it would have been just as good. I have this fantasy in my mind, all different actors being Miami. Like, Joe pesci as Horatio caine, going... What the fuck? You bring me all the way out here for a fucking dead body? You fucking... You Jew motherfucker. What the fuck? You stuttering prick, you spider... W-W-What am I? Pay no mind less? You never judge a fucking book by its cover? ♪ Bwow! ♪ Just as cool. Adam sandler as Horatio caine. He would take it to... He'd be like, It's... okay... I... it's... No, uh... I, uh... I don't know, uh, there's dead people here, you know, but, uh... ♪ La-ba-da-ba-doo ♪ But uh, she's dead, but she has very nice, big titties, that are dead too. Shut up! ♪ Bwow! ♪ It'd be awesome. Norm MacDonald as Horatio caine? Are you kidding me? What would have been better than norm MacDonald as a Miami homicide detective. He just comes on, he's all laughing and confused. Oh, my god. What the... what the "h"? Hey... Hey, there's a guy, uh... Hey, hold on a minute there, buddy. Hey, uh, guy, uh... Oh, my god. The guy's got a giant, giant hole where his chest used to be, you know. Oh, my god. You know, it's amazing, you know, huh? Every day, his wife says, uh, "hey, have a great day. Yeah, oh, my god. - Have a good day at work. - There, you know." And it probably never dawned on his wife there, you know, "hey, don't get a giant, giant hole in your chest, huh?" ♪ Bwow! ♪ Christopher walken? Are you kidding me? Yeah, Christopher walken as Horatio caine. That would be amazing. He'd go... Oh, yeah. I got here as fast as I could, but... I got a problem. You call me on my police radio cruiser, and you tell me... oh! You said, multiple homicides, but there's two dead bodies... Here. Look, baby, when you tell me that there's gonna be multiple homicides, I want 40, 50, 1,100 bodies stacked. I want to take a ladder to the top! Don't waste my time. Play my music. ♪ Bwow! ♪ He's like... He's the only guy that could actually ask for his own music. Tracy Morgan would have been a great Horatio caine. Tracy would just come out. He'd just come out of, like, Roscoe's chicken 'n waffles. He'd be like... Yeah, what happened, frank! You gonna tell me there was a murder while I was having my lunch? Yeah, we gon' get everybody pregnant, frank. This is what happens when the driven get taken for a ride! I miss my daughter, frank. My favorite book is scruples. I don't know who's dead or alive, but everybody's gettin' pregnant. I love you so much. I carry it in my heart. Yes. Yes! Thank you, San Bernardino. You guys are awesome. I love you. I miss my daughter. I'm getting everybody pregnant. Thank you very much. I love you guys. Thank you. I said earlier, and I was making a joke about having a gay kid, and I wanted you guys to know how much I love you for real. 'Cause without you guys, we don't have jobs. But if you have a gay kid, will you do me a favor? Just love him. Everybody's getting bullied out there. Let's teach 'em to kick some ass back. - There you go. - Oh, good job. That was great. Give it up for Jay mohr! It's pretty hot out there. - I know, I know. - Thank you, brother. Great job, man. - Did It look good? Did it look good? Was it great? - It was awesome. - I don't understand. It's hot in here, but, uh... it's a little warm.
