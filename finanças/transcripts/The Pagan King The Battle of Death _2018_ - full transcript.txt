(MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) THE PAGAN KING IN THE 13TH CENTURY, PAGAN TRIBES INHABIT THE LANDS ALONG THE SHORES OF THE BALTIC SEA, AND THE RICH TRADING NATION OF SEMIGALLIA HAS NOT GONE UNNOTICED BY ROME. THE POPE'S ILLEGITIMATE SON, MAX, SEEKS HIS FATHER'S AUTHORITY TO CONQUER THE REGION. HIS ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SEMIGALLIANS THEMSELVES, BRAVE WARRIORS WHOSE KINGDOM IS A PLACE WHERE EVEN VIKINGS HAD ONCE FEARED TO TREAD. - POPE'S RESIDENCE - You want to become my papal ambassador? Why? Well, I have no future in Rome. I have no respect. Here I'm just your bastard son... and you're the ruler of the Christian world. All I... all I want is to be the ruler of Semigallia. Very well. But if you fail to bring me the Ring of Kings, son or no son... this will be your destiny, too. Do you understand? Fulke, don't take your eyes off him. Yes, Father! Yes, Father. Fulke?! In future, you open the door for me. Got it? Wakey, wakey, Prince Pihto! Now it's payback time for all your years... of high living in Rome. The island of your birth awaits you! Who the hell are you? Oh, I'm your new friend. He doesn't look very pleased to see me, does he? Leave me alone. Here's the poison. How does it work? First of all, the cramps start. Then the fever rages, the organs shut down one by one and then... Finito! Perfect! Two bottles? Just in case. Maximilian, Father said I'm coming with you. Oh, why is that? Are you an expert poisoner? Umh, no... Or trained assassin? - No, not at all. - So why are you coming? I will preach the word of the Lord... and convert the poor, confused Pagans to Christianity. Fine. Whatever. (WOLF HOWLS) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) I want to ask you something. What is it?! It's important. You know if we win the game tonight, we'll set sail?! Are you sure about that? About leaving? About winning. Yeah, I'm sure. We're ready. We'll win and the ship will be ours... and we'll set out to see the world. Don't speak too soon, pride comes before a fall. You and your superstitions. What's this important question you wanted to ask me? I want to know... if you'll come with me. You want us to go together?! Yes, together! In good times and in bad times... till the end of time. What if I say no? Well, then I'll just have to go on my own. Or... perhaps I'll kidnap you. And once we're out at sea, you'll have to accept... your destiny and you'll grow to love your Semigallian... adventurer even more and then I'll marry you... in some far corner of the world. I'll take that as a 'maybe'! You better run, run, run, run! Peace, brother, peace, lay still. Peace, brother... peace, shh... Quiet! Christ! Per istam sanctam unctionem et suam pissimam misericordiam... adiuvet te dominus gratia spiritus sancti... Wonderful, but now you've cost me two men. Two? Two, yes, two! (MUSIC PLAYING) Ahhh... my money's on the winning team! Where have you been? The game's about to start. Relax! We've got this, I smell victory. Oh and Lauga's coming with us! What!? No, no, no! You can't just announce that... you're taking your girl with you! Why not? Take Gilla too... We'll talk about it later. I have other plans. That's for good luck! Thank you, Gilla! Hi, Sigi! Show them how it's done. Line up! Let's break some bones! May the best team win! To you. Sakens - Giant! Take his legs! Go for the legs! You can do it! Yes! Yes! Yes! Go! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Clean fight, clean fight. Go, go, go, go. Haaa! Hold him! Yeaaaaah! Hold! Hold! He's gonna do the viper. Hold! Now, Viper! Go, go, go! King Viesturs, we would like to exchange this for a ship. What do you need a boat for?! To see the world. Here's the world! Yes, but we want to travel and have adventures. When do you set sail? As soon as possible, while we can still get over... the rapids on Daugava River. And then on to Dnieper River and then into the Black Sea... to Constantinople and then who knows, maybe Rome. Good luck, Namay. - SAAREMAA ISLAND - (THUNDER ROLLING) I have to know, did you have anything to do... with my father's death? How many times do I need to tell you this?! So tell me again! No, I had nothing to do with your father's death! But since you arrived from Rome everything has changed. No, Max, you can't do that, you can't hit me. I am the ruler of Saareema now! Pull yourself together, you little shit. Your father died because it was God's will. I know you're grieving... but don't turn against those of us who are trying to help you. It's just... I'm not, not sure I'm... I'm ready to do what you ask of me. Do you believe in the one, true God? - Yes. - Do you?! - Yes. - I want to hear you say it. Yes, I believe in the one, true God. And that's all that matters. This is your destiny, little boy, as a Christian. - You are a Christian, aren't you? - Yes. Very good. We've got a funeral to organize. Viesturs, king of Semigallia is bound to set sail... to honour his friend Oru by drinking from his funeral horn. Is that correct? Is it? Yes. Cheers! (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) - Hey, owl! - I'm not an owl, I'm a squirrel. Why are your eyes like saucers then? Because I'm taking a shit! It's not the time for childish jokes... perhaps. Maybe not, but it's good to see you anyway. I'm so sorry. When did you get back from Rome? A while ago. I stayed too long. What do you mean? And now, according to the ancient Baltic customs... as Oru's son and heir, I invite you to honor... our dear, departed ruler's ascent into the heavens. My beloved brothers and sisters of Saaremaa! Let us pray! King Viesturs, such a tragedy about Oru. You knew him well, I believe. He was a friend. We saw more of each other before... Ah, before the... before the crusaders came to Saaremaa. Please be under no illusions I'm a man of peace. That is to say, all I offer are my condolences... and my friendship. This here must be your son. Rigvars, strong boy aren't you? I can see the family resemblance... striking. I have no doubt he will grow out to be a great ruler... just like his father and wear the Ring with pride. Well, God's blessings on you both. RIGVARS: Father, who is that man? Christian arse! Pagan scum! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Maybe they were poisoned? We all ate and drank the same. What then? Are you saying it's the work of the gods? What will happen if the sickness takes them both... and Viesturs hasn't said who will inherit the ring? You know exactly what will happen! The Assembly will sit down and decide the successor... and it could be one of us. Well, yes, but let's face it, most people will vote for Ulups. Maybe so, but he'll still need our votes. And you could still get them. If what? If you promise that the first thing you do... when you become king is rid us... of Viesturs' little friend Valdis. You know he deserves it, that ginger rat! I could be your advisor. What!? You!? I could advise for both of us! Well, so can I, you sneaky shit. - What'd you just say?! - Shit! Say that again! Say it to my face! Shit... Stop it! Calm down! - But he sta... - Shut up! (COUGHING) Anyway, Viesturs can still use his right as ruler... and name his successor himself, you know this. What are you talking about? It looks like your father will be king soon. Which will make you, Prince Arko! Sounds pretty good huh?! So what's the matter with him? Nothing, that's the point. He's sweet as honey. And that always means he's up to no good. I know him too well, he wants to go without me. What are you playing at? We can't take our women with us. Why not? Have you talked to Gilla? No! Have you lost your mind!? Think about all the women in all the harbors around the world. Hot as fire! If Gilla heard you fantasizing about other women... you'd feel the fire all right! You won't be laughing when you see what you're missing. A once in a lifetime opportunity just... Maybe you could still talk them out of it. (BREATHING HEAVILY) There's no one else, it has to be him. You're right. He's your bloodline. No one can argue with that. We don't know who did this to us. It could be any one of the tribal leaders. Exactly. That's why it's necessary that we choose... someone who has nothing to do with them. Someone no one would even think you would ask. This is so hard. I don't want his life in danger, too. I know, I know, but it's what we must do. He's tough, he'll be fine. You will help him, just as you helped me. Yes, my King. Hey, you two! We need to leave before the wind drops. Gilla, please... no! Wait! Wait! Just wait! - Stop and... stop and listen. - What? - Gilla, love! - I'm not your love anymore! Gilla, I just didn't know I needed to ask. - Don't! Don't lie. - Of course you're coming. - I'm not lying! - Stop lying! - I'm not, please I'm begging you! - Don't lie to me! Get on the boat!! Namay, you need to come with me. Now! - What is it? - You'll see. No, just you alone. It's all right. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, little man! Hey... Namay? Namay, I'm not afraid to go to the other side of the sun. You're very brave. Namay! Yes, King Viesturs. Take it. (MUSIC STOPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP) I'm very sorry. Here. He chose you. It's yours. Me? No, no, I... I, I can't take it, you, please. We are not asking, you must. Why me, I'm no Viesturs?! You don't have to be Viesturs. He chose you to be yourself. The ring is yours. And I beg you, as my king that you promise me one thing. You find who did this and you avenge my family. I've got a bad feeling about this. Valdis, has he survived? You'll find out soon enough. A very bad feeling... (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) People of Semigallia... I have grave news. Your ruler, your king, Viesturs and his prince and heir... Rigvars, have set sail to the kingdom of spirits, on the other side of the sun. Before he died, he named his new successor; the one who will wear the ring. Our destiny has spoken, kneel before your new ruler! Put on the ring. Show them, so they can all see it. King Namay. King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! King Namay! Not now, King Namay. All Semigallians know about this sacred place... but only the chosen few know how to find it. You must remember this secret path... for when you return here without us. During times of trouble and danger, Viesturs and all... the other rulers of Semigallia before him... came here to speak to the gods. I never thought I'd see this place with my own eyes. The spirits of our ancestors live here. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) The spirits protect the ancient wisdom... and the silver of Semigallia. Now all of this is in your hands. I'm not sure. What am I meant to do? Take care of those who want to claim the ring. You mean Daugulis, Birre, Ulups and his son? The tribal leaders, yes. What do you mean, take care of them? What do you think I mean? The people want a strong king who will do whatever it takes... to ensure their safety and security. - That's what Viesturs did. - Really, Viesturs? Believe me, you don't want to know what he was capable of. Now it's your destiny. You have the ring. Who the hell is Namay? He's the son of Viesturs' dead sister. Oh, is he now, and he is not even a tribal leader? No, he's just some orphan. And now he has the ring? I believe so. Fuck! I created a perfect power vacuum! The ideal time to take control. But no! Stupid Viesturs goes and gives the ring to a total nobody. Well... there's nothing else for it. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) We must attend his funeral just as he attended your father's. What!? Yes, yes, we'll go, we'll go to his funeral. No, no, no! I'm not going. They're bound to suspect me. You know the pagan custom, no one would dream of killing... a guest during a funeral. Good. This is just a minor setback. Oh, I'll still get that bloody ring on my finger. Yes, I will, mark my fucking words. Queen Rama, please, I need you to stay. I'm going with them. No, please, you don't have to. How can I stay when my spirit and everything I love... is setting sail for the other side of the sun?! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) If it was me, I'd claim my rights. King Namay! King Namay! Ah, stop it! Get up! Please, this is strange enough already. Oh, come on, show it to me. Oh, wow. Namay! On your hand that ring means nothing! When Viesturs gave it to you, he was completely out of his mind! Come on, Arko, this isn't the time. My father was meant to be king. And if he isn't man enough to take it from you, then I will! Shut up, Arko and just sit down. You're making a fool of yourself. I don't give a shit! Is this what you want, Arko? Don't do this. Don't talk to me, you're just a jumped-up servant! This can be settled some other way. Now, let's settle it now and forever. All right. Now, stay back, a sword fight. Arko, give it a rest. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (SNICKERING) Things just got a whole lot more interesting. You missed a golden opportunity. Let's hope it doesn't come back to bite you. Let's get her into the light. She'll do. Let her go, Max. Hmm, good idea, Pihto, let's let her go. Shh... What did you do? Well, I let her go. No... you're a madman. Let him run. Murder! Murder in cold blood! WOMAN: No, no, no. The holy rules are broken. Cast off, go. Come on, go, go, go! Cast off! (DOG GROWLING) Faster come on! (DOG BARKING) It's Pihto's dagger. It has the ruler's crest of Saaremaa on the handle. He's already set sail. I was a guest of Pihto's father, Oru, for some time. I came to know Pihto. What I learned about him I found troubling. In what way? I won't waste your time speculating as to why... I believe Pihto has chosen the path he has... but suffice to say that it's clear to me he had a hand... not only in his own father's death, but in the deaths... of your very own King Viesturs and prince Rigvars. Now he takes the life of an innocent woman. He's out of control and needs to be stopped. It's time for revenge. Revenge. Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Your king has heard you! He will take the fighting men of Semigallia to take revenge. The guilty one must receive his punishment. Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! I'm sorry about what happened to Gilla. But in some ways her death is a blessing in disguise. Nothing strengthens a ruler's authority more... than a glorious victory. It won't be easy, but I believe in you. You go to Saareemaa, return triumphant. Then we can rule Semigallia together. May the Gods and the spirit of Viesturs be with you! No way am I getting on his boat! I'm not having our tribe being accused of cowardice. You'll go, that's it. Don't forget, if something should happen to Namay... your father could be king. I don't care! - Shut up, you! - Be a man, do it for the family. As a mark of my respect for you and your people... I hereby place my own soldiers at your disposal. Let me get this right: you're a papal ambassador... and you're advocating the overthrow... of a Christian ruler by a Pagan one? This evil needs to be stopped. Everyone come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) I want to go with you. No, you can't. Something isn't right, I can feel it. I'm worried for you. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. I promise. I don't want to stay here all alone. Look. You'll have all the power of Semigallia and its people. You can't just give me the ring. Yes, I can. I'm the King. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) One of us ought to attack from the rear. My men and I should go for the main gate. They'll have it well guarded, but we'll distract them. You know this place better than us. We'll take the back. Let's go. Why did Pihto leave his dagger in Gilla's body? He didn't think we would come for revenge? He panicked, he ran away and just forgot to take it. Stop overthinking this. Remember what Max said. That's the point, isn't it? It was Max who found Gilla's body. It was Max who told us about Pihto. It was Max who encouraged us for revenge. Something is not right. We can't turn back. For Gilla, for Viesturs, for Rigvars. Come on! Okay. Back! Everybody back! Wall! Hold! Open up! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Viper! (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) Shit! That was a beginner's mistake. You allowed anger to cloud your judgment. Give me the ring. Give it to me. Sir. Nothing, sir. Unbelievable. You gave it to your whore, didn't you, like a worthless trinket? I don't need a ring to destroy you. Pagan scum, let me take care of him! No, that's exactly what he wants. He wants to die a hero, don't you?! Well Namay, I'm going to send you to Rome... they like a freak show there. I can see it now: The Last Pagan King! They'll probably put you next to the bearded lady. Meanwhile, everyone in your beloved Semigallia... will know that you were never worthy of the Ring of Kings. Oh, look at you, revelling in another's misfortune. That's not really Christian, is it?! And what should I do with them? Kill them and feed them to the pigs. Pihto, what the hell are you doing? This is insane. These men are our allies! - Were our allies. - But your father... My father nothing! I am in charge now! Come back! Come back now or I'll... Or what? You will kill me, too? Yes. (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) Show me that. Give it to me now! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) SOLDIER: Get him! (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) - (UNSHEATHS SWORD) - Huh? - (SCREAMING) - (FLESH HISSING) Hey, Owl! I'm not an owl, I'm a squirrel. Why are your eyes like saucers then? Because I'm taking a shit. I'm coming with you, Namay. And once we've chopped off that bastard Max's head... I'll return to Saaremaa and do the same to his crusaders. Good to hear. (TRIBAL DRUMS BEATING) I'm not a slave, I'm not rowing like this. Max is way ahead of us, we'll never catch him. We should never have come to this godless place. This is all your fault! Stop whining and keep rowing! Why? Namay is no king. He doesn't know how to lead. I say we throw him over the side. I'll throw you over the side! Hey! Stop! Sit down and listen! Max may be ahead of us, Arko... but I know how we can catch up with them. How wonderful, our beloved leader has another plan! Come on, why don't you share it with us?! We can carry the boat over the dune to the river. That's our only chance. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Namay, well, he's on his way to Rome. I don't believe you! Believe what you like, Valdis. A change is coming to Semigallia whether you like it or not. And you can either be a part of that change... or you can allow it to cut you down. But, Valdis I have nothing against you... in fact, well, I see you as an ally. So I tell you what, I'll let you go back to your people... and you can discuss whether you want to hand over the ring... or whether I have to come and take it, how does that sound?! Everyone gather around! What's going on? Come on, come on now! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Zabis, run to Ulups, tell him what happened... and have him alert the other tribal leaders. Go! Namay's gone. Don't you understand it? He is not coming back. Namay would never betray us! That's beside the point! He's not here, we have to deal with this on our own. Now answer me, do you have the ring? Do you have the ring? This is no time for games. Do you have the ring? Yes, I have it! But there's only one person in the world... that I'd give it up to, and that's Namay! Agh! Let's not wait any longer. Forward! Hey, watch out! Do you want to drown us all? That's the river up there... if you move this lever, we will all die! Lauga! (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Now what the hell went wrong? Do you want to talk about that now!? Now... now we need to negotiate with Max. Negotiate?! I'm gonna kill him! Come on, everybody, arm up! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! We need to be smart about this. Smart? Were we smart when we let Max deceive us? This is our land and we need to fight Max and whoever else... tries to take it from us. You heard your king! To your weapons, everyone, arm up! (DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP) Agh! Go! Hold your line! Drat... Max! Max! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) In nomine patris, et filii et spiritus sacti. Amen. If we can't even defeat the pagan savages of Semigallia... then it doesn't look good. We must be seen to be strong. Just give me more soldiers and I can finish this. You failed me! I can't give you a second chance. Look, I know you're my son, but I can't be seen to show favor. Well, there it is. Listen to me. You are going to declare a crusade on Semigallia. Crusade? Look, I want to help you, I really want to... but, but the fact is, no good soldiers at the moment... really there are none, they are away on other crusades. I don't need good soldiers. I need merciless slaughterers... and I know exactly where to find them. In nomine patris, et filii et spiritus sacti. In nomine patris, et filii et spiritus sacti. In nomine patris, et filii et spiritus sacti. In nomine patris, et filii et spiritus sacti. In nomine patris, et filii et spiritus sacti. (ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING) In the name of the gods that reside within us all... and by the life that courses in my blood... I choose you, Lauga... to possess you, to be possessed by you and to love you... with all my heart until the end of time. In the name of the gods that reside within us all... and by the life that courses in my blood, I choose you... Namay, King of Semigallia, to possess you... to be possessed by you and to love you... with all my heart until the end of time. (MUSIC FADES UP) Hey. My Queen, thank you. I never doubted you. You sure about that? Maybe once for a moment, but never again. Hi. Pull, heave, heave, heave... Te deum laudamus: te Dominum confitemur. Ah, look at him. He can't get enough of it. I'm really starting to lose my patience with him. He still thinks we want to convert these pagan fools. So you think all the other tribal leaders will come then? They will, now they know that Traidenis is coming. What is it with Traidenis? No one wants to make an enemy of him, nor should you. We are very lucky that we are good friends with him. So if we convince Traidenis, then we convince the others?! Ah, now you're thinking. But Traidenis doesn't care about anybody. He does his own thing. That's it. Why the cape? To catch a skunk, first you must cover yourself in its scent. Now what you gonna say? Any ideas? All across Europe, people bow down to Rome. They are imprisoned in their own homes... paying taxes to live on their own land. We must unite and fight. So what do you think? Well, I think they will tell you to fuck off. Unite? Under whose leadership? Is Semigallia not enough for you, Namay? You want to rule over all of us now, is that it? Max and his crusaders will return... and when they do, believe me, there will be more of them. We need to be ready. Namay, we trade with Christians from all over Europe. Whilst they're only trading with us, there's no harm done. On the contrary, how can a cross be bad, if it's made from gold? And now, since we've defeated them once... they'll be more easy to control. I admire your determination and your lofty ideals, but... You will never persuade the tribal leaders to give up... trading with Christian lands. Sometimes, you need to look at the bigger picture. I see the picture only too well. You're thinking of trade, but Max is no trader. He is a ruthless bastard who is greedy for power... and wants to make us his slaves. We need to defeat him... and the only way to succeed is if we're united. Listen, kid, when I heard that Viesturs had given... the Ring of Kings to some nobody... instead of an honorable tribal leader, I was worried. Now I've met you... and I can see how wise my dear friend was. You pathetic, short-sighted, self-satisfied, bunch of losers. You're thinking just about your own wealth. I am ashamed to be part of this assembly of smug fools. Namay, when you need me, send word. (MEN YELLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (DOG WHINES) Max was right, you're way tougher than your father. We must never let the tribes unite! So what now? We tell everyone that Traidenis's men... killed these people. There will be no more talk of unity then. - No one can find out about this. - No one will. There's no one to point the finger at you. They're all dead! Don't worry. This is just the beginning. What the hell is the matter with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. Murderer! - Why, Arko? - What the hell are you talking... Stop it. No! Arko, no! No! Arko broke our laws. May my son be cursed. King Namay, my and my family's lives are in your hands. Keep your sword, Ulups, you're gonna need it. (DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP) (HOWLING) The strength of the pack is in the wolf... and the strength of the wolf is in the pack. The other tribal leaders need to realize the danger we all face. They understand the danger well enough. They just want someone else to fight Rome... while they carry on trading. A mountain with a wolf on it stands a little bit higher. The wolf dies where the pack is. Do you trust your pack? You mean Ulups? You killed his son. He is twice as dangerous now. I was just upholding our tribal laws. Make yourself a sheep and the wolf will eat you. What is it, Ulups? The crusaders are here. There are more of them than before. They're ready for battle. We must send a messenger to Traidenis. There's no time, our men are already prepared. - We must attack them now. - We? Namay, I won't deny it hasn't been easy between us. But you were right, if we stick together we will crush them! He's right, we need to do whatever it takes... to keep invaders from our lands. We have no choice. You're honest and brave men. Our disagreements are in the past. Let's prepare for battle! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) So we still have a deal right? Oh, sure. Yeah, you can take the lands beyond the river. You, Birre, you, can have, hm, you can have Saaremaa. And Semigallia? Oh, Semigallia belongs to me. Traitors! Whoa, whoa, I didn't betray you! You have to trust me, I have every reason to hate you! But that is more important than you and me. You have to believe me, Namay, as long as I have breath... in my body, I will fight to stop that bastard... from taking even a grain of sand from Semigallia. Line up! How do you like this, pagans will defeat themselves. Who'd have thought that it would be so easy... they look so strong and proud. Yes, but pride is a friend of envy... and envy is a friend of greed. If you dangle enough money someone will always sell... even if what they're selling doesn't belong to them. Finish 'em! Ulups! Save yourselves! Now! Traitors die! Retreat! Run! Come on. Run. Get up. Come on! Come on! Leave me! Save Semigallia! I'm sorry. They're coming! Siggi, we need to get the women and children out of here now! - Through the tunnel? - Yes. We'll try to slow them down. Everybody, hurry up, through the tunnel. Come on then, let's burn them out. - Come on, come on, run! - Mommy, where are we going? Come on, come on quickly. Flame! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Aim! Mommy, wait! Release! Flame! Aim! Release! Stop, stop, I beseech you! Cleanse yourselves of sin... and practice justice and righteousness. Love your brother as yourself. Turn away from your violent and destructive ways. Do not stray from the path of peace. We are all God's children! In nomine Patris et fillii et Spiritus Sancti. In nomine Patris et fillii et Spiritus Sancti. Down the tunnel. In nomine Patris et fillii et Spiritus Sancti. Take him out! In nomine Patris et fillii et Spiritus Sancti. Aim! Release! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) SOLDIER: Come on, heave! Fall back to the tunnel! Come on, get up! (SCREAMING) Come on! Come on! (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) - Come on. - Hurry, hurry! (WATER RUNNING) Fuck! Fuck off! Namay, Namay, we can't do this. Yes, I know but, we have no choice. This is the holy place. We need to hide somewhere. This is the place where the ruler... and those closest to him come to commune with the gods. We can commune with the gods together. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) I should have asked Gilla to come with me. But I'll ask her tonight. Smile, my friend, your sad face is scaring me. (DISTANT THUNDER ROLLING) Mm, very well, I agree to your terms. We'll... we'll send a messenger with you. Oh and um... thank you. Fulke, I'd like you to go as messenger. You'll be followed all the way, of course. Did you mean what you said? Which part? The part about allowing all the Semigallians... and their warriors to return home in exchange for the ring. Well no, of course not. We'll take the ring when they surrender... and then we'll kill them all. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (HISSING) Shh... Shh... Shh... I wanted you to come with me, so I could show you the world... but instead I brought you here. I'll go wherever you'll go, wherever your path takes you... I'll be with you. Namay... Namay! What is it? There's a messenger from Max on the shore. How? Are there soldiers with him? He seems to be on his own. Blindfold him and bring him to me. Namay, I have a message for you. I don't care about that. What I wanna know is who betrayed us?! Max says that if you give him the Ring of Kings and with it... your acceptance of him as ruler of Semigallia... you will be allowed to return home unharmed. You have until dawn tomorrow to let us know your decision. We will wait for you by the hill on the edge of the swamp. Get him out of my sight. We must call a meeting. No shit! We can't trust Max. Look what the crusaders have done to our neighbors' lands. What they are really interested in... - is getting rich off our taxes. - I agree! Maybe if we do that, they'll leave us alone. And then our children won't starve or freeze to death. I'm not bowing before that bastard. We've never surrendered before, and we won't surrender now. But at least we'd be alive. You're joking. As soon as they have the ring, they will slaughter us. No, we could be very valuable to them. I say we give Max the ring and take our chances. We have to trust him, there's no other way. He's right, Namay, that's what we all think. I just wanna go home. Go on then, here it is. Go on, take it, if you're happy to explain to your children... years from now that the reason they don't have any freedom... is because their father gave it away. We can't fight them. If we fight them, we'll die. So go on then, huh, take it, please take it, give it to Max. Anyone? Nobody? If you can't do it, let me do it for you, Namay. It was you?! I have always supported you. You betrayed us?! Why? I just tried to save our people. Offering your people up for slavery is not saving them. My fate is to serve. I serve only the strongest. That's not you any more. Max will rule these lands. I know you don't like to hear it, but it's true. So you say either we die in battle... or we live under the crusaders? Well I say, it's better to die on your feet... than to live on your knees. Come on, wake up! You're on the wrong path! I've already made my choice. Because I wear the ring, you all expect me to tell you... what to do, but I'm not going to, not anymore. Everyone must choose their own path, you can go with Valdis... or you can stay with me and fight until the end. But there are too many of them and too few of us. No one can see a pack of grey wolves in the fog. This swamp is our home, but to them it's a trap. We will launch an attack in the morning. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC ENDS) I know this must've been very hard for you... but you can absolutely rest assured... you've done the right thing. Ah, Namay, so good to see you again. Hand it over. You're not having the ring. Namay have sense, just give it to him, you can't win this. I'm afraid, he's right. I think I'll take my chances. Look out! Charge! (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMING) Run! I have the ring! I have the ring! SOLDIER: I've got the ring! I've got the ring! (DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP) SOLDIER: I found the ring! I found the ring! I've got the ring! I got the ring! You fool. Fate handed you power and you gave it away to everyone. Well, this is the end of you and your ring. No, it's the end of you. For us, it's a new beginning. Your excellency, Maximilian's dead. "For God so loved the world... "that he gave his only begotten son..." So what happens with Semigallia now? We'll just send someone else. IT TOOK THE CRUSADERS ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS TO CONQUER SEMIGALLIA BUT THEY COULD NEVER BREAK ITS SPIRIT. FOR NAMEJS TAUGHT HIS PEOPLE THAT POWER AND LEADERSHIP COM NOT FROM ON HIGH BUT FROM WITHIN, AND EVERYONE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN PATH IN LIFE. TO THIS DAY, THE RING OF NAMEJS REMAINS A SYMBOL OF HONESTY, BRAVERY AND PERSONAL FREEDOM. (MUSIC FADES UP)
