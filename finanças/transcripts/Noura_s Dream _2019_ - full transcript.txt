I love you. Stop! You're crazy! I love you a lot. I want to devour you. If it's the Moroccan whom everyone is talking about, he's expensive. Yes, we'll go and see. Shit. Listen, I'll call you later... Bye! Calm down, it wasn't deliberate! You're pissing me off! -I'll help you. -Leave it. You're a bit touchy! Noura, my son's giving me grief. He's going to Libya, and he needs money. I need you to give me my money back. Get it ready! I need to get paid first. -Just don't forget it when you get paid-- -OK, I got it. Yes, Hamma. They're all in the washing machines. It's just whites... All right! Five minutes. Don't be late. Bye! Stop stealing. I don't want any trouble. Like you're not used to it. I'm not taking any shit for three sheets! I'd do more than that! You're getting a bit touchy! Idiot... When will you truly be mine? You smell nice. What's that? Petrol? Diesel. Hello. Where's Kalthoum? I'm her replacement. -What's your name? -Noura Gargouri. -Hello. -Hi. Here are the case papers for Jamel. So many charges! Theft, fraud... Why did you stay with him? -When will the divorce go through? -In four days. -What's today's date? -It's the fifth. Does your husband know? No, the summons was sent to our old address. Kalthoum and the lawyer are aware of that. Could you give us a moment? I'll wait for you. -Does he know your children? -Who? -Him. -He knows them. Why? Is there a problem? There's no problem. Don't disrupt your children's life for the sake of a man! What do you mean? Nothing. He probably doesn't give a damn about you... and is just having fun! What? He sleeps with me then forgets about me? -So? I'm not doing anything wrong! -And your children? What's your problem? What about my children? There's no problem. I'm just thinking about your children. My children are my concern! They have nothing to do with you. You know that you both risk five years in prison? I know. Anything else? No, but we can no longer help you with rent. -Leave that. It's Dad's! -Mind your own business! -All you care about is food! -You make me ashamed! Belhassen! -Hi, Yasser! -Haven't seen you in ages. How are you, bud? Atef Jlassi, Mohsen Dridi, Jamel Gargouri, Moncef Hosni, Walid Beji... Mohsen Hamem, Mohamed Khedr, Ched Erais There he is! Douda! -I missed you, Daddy. -I missed you, too. How are you, Daddy? So you don't come to see Daddy anymore? I asked her to bring us here. You could have come by yourself. Give Daddy a kiss! Give me five! Yeah! Look after your brother and sister, OK? Give him a tap. Stop it! It's just for fun. -Hi, Dad! -Hi! -Are you all right? -Yes. -Are you being good? -Yes. -Sure? -Yes. Look me in the eye! -Don't get up to any mischief! -OK. I'll put Yosra on. -Are you OK, Dad? -You've really grown! You're wasting away. -What's new? -I'm fine. And you? -Great. -Doing well, I see. Get your mother. -He wants to talk to Mom. -Stop it. -Hi! -Hi! I brought you some salad. I made you some pasta and beans. What else? Oh, and I've brought you some olive oil. Your nail polish is pretty. Thanks. Why are you hiding it? I'm not hiding it. You haven't been here for three weeks. I haven't had time, Jamel! You have time to paint your nails but no time for me? Wait over there! Wait there. I need to talk to your dad. Lower your top a bit! Lower it a bit! What's wrong? -Lower your top! -I'm tired of this. -What do you mean, tired? -I can't take coming here anymore. Just like that? Because of you, we've had to move three times in a year. The kids have to keep changing schools. I don't have the energy anymore. You think I meant for it to be like this? Do you think I wanted this? You think I chose this? I don't want this anymore. I want to talk to Dad. -I've been asking her to bring us. -Get lost, kiss-ass! -You're just a piece of shit. -Don't treat me like shit, idiot. -Shit! -Stop! Tell that bitch to shut up! Do you think I'm lying? Everyone at school does. Yosra, put the sheets away and help me clear the table. Hurry up. You need to go to school. I'm not going. -Yes, you are going. -I don't want to! Finish that! Give me that! Belhassen! Come and help your sister! Grab hold of it there... Fold it right! Quickly! What are you doing? Hold the sheet properly! -Algia, the boss wants to see you. -Why? He wants to ask you about the sheets. Maybe he thinks I stole them? You're the one in charge here. So I have to play the cop now? Whatever. Do as you please! Well, we'll see now! This is because of you! Get lost. Am I responsible for all the thefts around here? Are you ready? -We have a real problem. -What is it? It's Algia... Wait! I'm coming. They're calling me. -Should I wait here? -Yes. What's wrong? -He's out! -What are you talking about? -Jamel is out! -What? Is Jamel at the hospital? OK, calm down! It's OK. Look at me! I'll go and see him. Wait! Are you mad? -I want him to know! -Know what? You want us to be in jail? Five years! Let me deal with it. I'll sort it out. Wait for me in the back. Lassad, please... Let me deal with it! -Come with me! -What's wrong? -Jamel is out of prison. -Impossible! Jamel! Hi! Welcome back! Are you OK? -Fine, and you? -Fine. I met your son inside. Are you upset with him? He hit me on the head. -What do you expect? -He's young. Don't worry, he'll be fine. If there's anything new, let me know! Thanks, bye! -I'll be right there. -OK, Noura. Let's go over there. Give me time to take things in! Take your time! How did you get out? -Presidential pardon. -Great! Why did you move without telling me? Didn't I tell you? -I told you! -No. My memory must be going. Give me the keys. Where is the new place? -In Bab Saadoun. -Where exactly? The road behind the bus station. Opposite the pharmacy? Yes, near there towards the Bardo. Fourth house on the right... Number 16. I have to get back to work. I'll see you later! Hey! Forget something? -What? -The keys! Don't be late! -Where are you? -In the parking lot. Come outside! Why didn't you look at me? Stay there! Stay there! How could I look at you? -Then what? -Don't be so crazy, Lassad! -How did he get out? -Presidential pardon. Pardon! The bastard! Lassad, I gave him the house keys! What? Why the hell did you do that? Stop shouting! He asked me for them. What else was I supposed to do? Are we just going to screw everything up now? Let's talk tomorrow at 10:00 a.m... at the café! OK. Hello? Listen, Lassad! Don't call me... -Why? -He might check my phone. -Put it on vibrate! -No, I'd better not! -Delete your text messages. -OK, I'm going to delete everything. What is this? We'll be searched every day! I don't have a problem with that! Haven't you noticed anything, Noura? Noura! Are you listening to me? Haven't you seen anything suspicious? No, I haven't noticed anything. Hi! Did you find the house OK? How do you like it? Jamel! -Welcome back. -Hamadi! How are you? I'm screwed. I can't work tomorrow. The children! -Little girl! -Daddy! ‪Give Papa some kisses. -What's wrong? -Nothing. Come kiss me! Let's play the drum. Oh, I like that drum... Do you know what we're going to do? We're moving all the furniture. Take everything off of it. Don't break anything! -Noura! -Yes. We'll put this bench here and move the other one. -I've just cleaned the house! -And I'm just doing it again! Why do you want to move everything around? It's all fine as it is. Help me move this bench! Why? -I want to switch the benches. -Tell me how. That bench over there will go here... and the other one will go over there. -How are we going to watch TV then? -Like this. -Go and help your sister! -I already did. -Where do you want the mattress? -We'll see. Lift it with me! -Help me! -Noura! Get your apron, Nadia! Gently, Jamel! Gently! Where are all my things? My clothes? -Here! -I was looking for them everywhere. They're in the green bag. I'll wash them for you. And our bed? -The bed? -I sold it. Why? There was no space! -What about over there? -It was old anyway. Dad! What kind of a hug is that? Hug me tightly! -Mom, I'm going to study at my friend's. -No, your father has just come home. Can I go, Dad? I said no! -Tidy up around here! -My bedroom is tidy. Is this your bedroom? Take your schoolbag! Where's my mattress? Here it is. -Where are you sleeping? -Here, in the lounge. Come here, darling! Jamel! Bellahsen! Bellahsen! What money? Stop all this nonsense, Nabil! What? You set yourself on fire? -Your son again? -He says he'll set himself on fire! -Algia, can I leave a bit early today? -Give me my money back! -I will when I get paid. I told you! -He's going to do something stupid! What are you talking about? He's blackmailing you! That's my problem. Just give me my money! Leave me alone, bitch! Give me my money back! You've got money! Stop! -Welcome! -The usual. Smoking again? Not good for you. You also smoke! Should we go back to the association? What for? You should have sorted it out yesterday! What are we waiting for? Let's leave. Easier said than done! Leave how? I'm not on my own! I didn't ask you to leave them. They have a father. Did he touch you? -Did he try to? -Stop! -Are you sure? -What's wrong with you? I'd rather not know! Noura... I don't want you to sleep with him! Are we agreed? It's bad for you! Here's the bedroom. And there's a big lounge. The toilet, the kitchen, and the shower are over there. It looks great! I'll come back with the money soon, so I can get the keys. -OK but don't be long. -OK, Mom, thanks. -Hi! -My dear Nadia, you are the star-- Why are you studying here? Sit at the table and read quietly. -Are you OK? -Yes, I'm exhausted. I found a new house. We're moving! I might lose the deposit here! -So what? -It's money! Money isn't a problem. Yosra, get me my coffee! Belhassen, don't you have homework to do? -No. -Oh, really? -Mom, pass me your phone. -No. -Buy me one then. -I don't have any money. -You never have money! -I'll get you one. Mommy, I have some division to do. -We already did that! -These are decimal point divisions. Yosra, do you remember how to do decimal point divisions? -No, I've forgotten! -You're really dumb! You should have asked your teacher. The match is starting. Shall I show them your math book, idiot? Shall I show them your secrets? -See, Dad! -Give me it back! Give it back to her! -Shit, let go of me! -Give me the phone. -Shut your mouths and get out! -Jamel! Get out! Calm down. I'm taking them out! See? We're going! Out! Everyone! Common get out OK, I am leaving. Calm down! -Go and sit down! -No. Come here! It's OK! -Good morning! -Hi! I'm going to work. There's no need to make dinner. I'll bring some roast chicken. Let's treat ourselves! When will you be back? In the evening. Hey, what are you doing? My phone! It was him! Catch him! Get back here! -Here comes the sprinter. -You're going to kill me. Either that or we'd be done for! This phone is hot stuff! Listen! This time, you be the lookout! And you cover me, OK? You're going to be late! I'm going. The person you are trying to reach is not available... Can I borrow the car? My cousin is moving. -When? -Around midday. Around midday is not possible! When then? You can have it this afternoon. OK. Thanks! Come on, Abla! Two minutes. I'm just counting the money. It's all correct. Thanks. Hi, everyone! Let's have the dough! -What's this? -I'm flat broke. -I don't care! -See you later! -What about you? -I haven't got any yet! Hamadi... could you give me a bit of time? Let's see the dough! You know I have kids and bills to pay. I just got out, man! I have to pay for school too! And buy my son a PlayStation! -We'll get him one! -No problem. No discussion. How's your wife? She's fine. Come to the window. What's wrong? Do you want to know? I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore, Noura! I couldn't sleep all night! All this is killing me! I can't wait any longer! I'll arrive at your place at 5:00 p.m. Come out when I ring the bell! -And the kids? -We'll pick them up from school. Don't look at me like that! Noura! Either we're together... Or it's over. OK. I'll go pack my things. OK... All right, bye! Noura! -What are you doing here? -I'll leave you two alone. What do you mean? Where are you going? I'm going to get some yogurt. I came to show you the new house. -I have work, Jamel! -It'll be quick! You should have told me before, so I could sort something out. Come on! No, I have an interview for the manager position. Make something up! Tell them something came up! -The keys... I forgot them. -What keys? The keys for the new house. Is this some kind of joke? It only takes two seconds to go and get them! -I don't have time! -Please, Noura! I told you. I have work. -What's wrong, Noura? -Nothing. Noura! Where are you? What are you eating? We're going to celebrate my release. So that whole story about the keys was a big lie? No, not at all! I miss you! Is that a problem? Sit down!

Why? I'm going to miss out on the manager position! Please, I've hardly seen you... You're going to make me miss out on that job! Shit, I just want to talk. Sit down! Since I got out, we've had no time to talk! What did I do to you? You don't look at me anymore. You'll be too late anyway! Please! There's so much I want to tell you. I've really changed, Noura! I want to change things. I want things to get better. I want to find a job... I want to start praying. I'll take care of the kids. I'll take care of you. I've had enough of all this shit!

The one in Bab Saadoun. -Who were you with? -Some friends. -Their names? -Salah and Mongi. -Give me their numbers! -I don't have them. How come you don't have their numbers?

What are you trying to put on me? He reported you. The man filed a medical certificate. ‪I don't know him. -You're under arrest! -Why? You still don't have an alibi? -I'll find their numbers. -How? The café owner knows them. Talk to him. Café owner. Bring the café owner in! -Did your wife help you? -What does she have to do with this? A woman called him to lure him into a trap. What trap? I don't know anyone named Lassad. So you don't know him? -Pay me then I'll go-- -Take this piece of shit out! ‪Out! Aarbi, bring the wife in! Over there! Sit down! Do you know that this makes you an accessory? What do you mean an accessory? Lassad has reported your husband. Do you know him? -No. -He says you called him! I didn't call anyone! -Give me your phone! -I left it at home! We can get a list of all your calls! -Go on then! -OK, we will! -You weren't on patrol? -No. -Did you arrange the meeting? -No! -Are you sure? -Yes! You think he has nothing to do? That he just filed this report for fun? I've never had anything to do with Jamel's affairs. This time, it's a big deal involving a garage robbery! -Which garage? -The one where Lassad works. -Who's Lassad? -You don't know anyone named Lassad? No, I don't. Never! It's quite sad! Do you like living this way? If you report him this time, he'll go down for at least ten years. Just get rid of him! If I knew anything, I'd have told you! I have nothing to do with any of that! -Where's her husband? -Inside. -Where were you last night? -At home. -With whom? -The kids. -Alone? -Yes. -What were you doing? -Nothing. Nothing? You weren't even watching television? Everyone watches television except you! The neighbors were having a party. I couldn't watch television. And Jamel? -Jamel went out. -At what time? -I forgot. -How come you don't know? -Morning, evening, when exactly? -Around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. -When did he get back? -I was asleep. Bring Jamel in! Don't look at her! -Where were you last night? -I already told you... at the café. Is it such a big deal to repeat it? Which café? La Rosa. -What time did you go there? -Midnight. -When did you get back? -At 2:00 a.m. Your wife said 8:00 p.m. When did he go out? -Do you think she got it wrong? -She must have. Did you get it wrong, madam? What time did you say? -Midnight. -Out at midnight? -Make up your mind! -Midnight. Let's move on... Since you're not sure... Tell me, how was your evening at home? -Just the usual. -Meaning? -I was watching television. -Really? There was no disturbance? No noise? No music? No party at your neighbors' house? -You didn't hear anything? -No. Your wife said there was a party. -I was watching television. -The music didn't bother you? -I told him that! -I ask the questions! Do you know why you didn't hear anything? Because you were busy beating up Lassad and robbing his garage. -What garage? -You refuse to admit it? But you found me at home... All that doesn't mean anything to you? -I don't know anyone named Lassad. -And you, Noura? Was he wrong when he said you called? I didn't call anyone. -You don't know him? -No. No one knows Lassad here! -We don't-- -Shut up! I said shut the hell up! I'll introduce you to him! Call Lassad! Sit down over there! OK, leave him. Sit. Do you know those two? Look at him! Him, yes. But I don't know her. -You know me? -I ask the questions here! -I barely said a word. -Let me do my job, please! Was he the one who attacked you? -Yes. -Me? Shut your fucking mouth! -Speak up, so we can hear you. -And say what? -Do you recognize this voice? -No. You haven't finished yet! Where's your colleague? -Why? Do you not like me? -I do. Lassad, you said Noura called you! No, I said it's someone called Moufida. You don't know Noura? No. Do you invite any woman who calls you to go to your garage? She said her car broke down! I deal with urgent calls at the garage. You can ask the boss! Good! How did you know her name? She gave me her name. So am I the suspect now? How do I know you're not behind all this? So I smashed my face in by myself? Noura! -Do you know Lassad? -No, I don't. -Noura! -Yes. -Do you know Lassad? -I said no! I'm looking at him. I can't recognize him. -Are you sure? -I've told you I don't know him! And do you know him? -No, I don't. -So you're denying it? -So I made it all up? -Quiet! -Noura, do you know Lassad? -No. -Are you sure? -Positive. -Leave my wife alone. -Son of a bitch! Let go of me! Don't touch me, you bastard! -This guy's sick in the head! -I said sit down! Sit down! What has gotten into you? -Is there no justice? -Shut up! -I have a medical certificate-- -Shut up! Can I file a complaint? -He tried to kill me! Did you see that? -A complaint? You can make a statement. As for you, we're going to go through your phone calls and see if this Moufida called you. What are you talking about? Who has the medical certificate? Me or him? -You're messing with the law! -I am the law. -Call the police chief! -Keep quiet! Get him out of here! -What the hell is this? -Get him out of here! You can't just do as you please! Seems you really do want me to file for attempted murder. Can I see my kids? Not just yet. Mr. Hamadi... The poor kids must be worried. Let her go, please! You can go now. Thank you! You're accused of assault. That's the best I can do for you! I could have killed him. He was hitting on my wife. I'd screw him over. What happened? Uncle Lassad just left. -What did he say? -That you were coming. -Where's Dad? -He's still in there. -Is he coming? -I don't know. Mom, is it true? Is what true? About Lassad? -Of course not! -So why was he so good to us? He's my friend's brother, and he helps me. Then why arrest us? Because of your father! He'll never change. -How are you? -Fine. ‪What the heck! NOURA Please leave a message after the beep. The number you're calling can't be reached. Please leave a message after the beep. FORGIVE ME Hello? Are you sure? OK! -Where is he? Where's Lassad? -On the terrace. Why? Tell him to come! Tell him my divorce has gone through. One second. Mom's here. -Hello, madam! -What's she doing here? Has Sarra told you? Yes. -I love you! -Let go! -I love you! -I said let go of me! I won't let go of you! I love you! OK, I heard you! Lassad! -Look at me! -Get lost! I won't let go. Talk to me! -Talk to me! -Enough! Stop! I love you! -Talk to me, please! -Don't you understand? You disgust me! Shit! Mom! Are you OK? I'm fine. I just have a bit of a stomachache. I'll make you a herbal tea. Mom! God hit me! -What are you talking about? -With a shoe to my head, I swear! Bullshit. God doesn't hit anyone! I'm telling you, God hit me! It was your own sneakers tied to the electrical cables, you idiot! -Shut up, you! -You got a problem? -I wish you were not born! -OK, so what? Mommy! What's wrong, sweetie? I don't want to study. Why? I got a zero in math, and the teacher made fun of me. -Find me a job instead. -There's a job as a mechanic available. Smarty-pants, I'm going to get myself something to eat. Hello?
