A NETFLIX ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY Lorena! Lorena! Let's go, Lorena! Go, Lore! Go, Lore! Go! Lorena! How are you doing? It's me! I'm going to run with you for a bit. I don't think about anything. It feels good... to strive towards a goal. I live here, in Chihuahua, Mexico. The air is good here, on Rarámuri land. There's no smoke from factories. EL HORMIGUERO TARAHUMARA MOUNTAIN RANGE Child, let's go To the mountain top We'll run a race to the peak We've got to cheer the runner on So he doesn't lose heart Mister, we have to split the pine To light the runner's way Auntie, get the pinole ready The runner might be hungry I like my land and everything that surrounds it. CHIHUAHUA ULTRAMARATHON REGISTRATION GUACHOCHI Look up, Lore. Her father, Santiago Ramírez, has won the Guachochi Ultramarathon three times. Last Saturday, Lorena, his 22-year old daughter, won it. Lorena ran 63 miles in 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 25 seconds. No, have her sign. Have her sign it first. Lore, smile! You're a champ, Lore! -Champ! -Stand between them. Oh, that's great. I don't know, we'll see what they do. I think they'll keep taking pictures as long as I keep winning. Who knows... if they'll keep taking pictures of me when I stop? Lorena, Lorena, a picture, please. -We're your fans. -Thanks. Thank you. That's the way winners are. She doesn't talk so much. Like a deer, that's just how they are. A deer also looks at you like this. Then they're off. She won't talk. It was hard for me to go to school, it was a five-hour walk. And my sisters couldn't go to school because we had animals here and they had to take care of them. My brother and I went though, just the boys. I wanted the girls to go too, but it wasn't possible. Our whole family grew up like this, in a home without... friends. All alone. Our closest neighbors are really far away. We're always walking. We walk to La Ciénaga in Norogachi for groceries. It's like three or four hours walking slowly. I've never... used public transport... to go buy groceries. And then, one day we realized our feet were good for running. That we had... this talent for running. What are you doing, Rarámuri? Oh, you're whispering. I didn't remember. I had to be so quiet. Be quiet. The first time my father took me to Guachochi was to run a seven-mile race. I never thought I'd be a good runner, or that I'd win. But yes, I won. I wish you the best. I hope you do well. Come back safe. Be very careful, I know it isn't easy. Don't take any risks. Though I know you'll do great. Thanks. Good luck to everyone in this race. We're going to do a countdown. I'd like the audience to join in. Five, four, three, two, one! Go! Let's go, guys! That's it! I started out the race... kind of slowly. But at 13 miles, I picked up the pace. I was very happy because no one was catching up to me, and I wasn't too tired. At 40 miles, it was still fine. I got really tired. Yeah... because I was running harder. I always push myself to make it to the goal. It's no game. Go, Lorena! You can do it! I say to myself... "Nearly there, it's not much longer to the finish line." Good job! -Great! Bravo! Well done, Lorena! -Lorena! You're an idol! Keep it up! What are you doing, my child? Are you thinking of me? It's good all the same. If she loses, it's fine, if she wins, great. It's all the same to me. There's no need for pressure. She doesn't have to win every time, no. Sometimes it's really hard on your feet, too much pain. Really painful. I'm glad to be back. We sew our own clothes. Me, my mother, and my sisters. I have a special lighter dress for running. Sometimes I run with shorts, but I wear them under my skirt. I wouldn't be Lorena without my skirt. Urique, 50 miles. I don't know where this one was. It's from my first race. This one belongs to Cuauhtémoc. We have four medals for 63-mile races. Winning is important to make money, but it isn't always possible. You're the first one here. Lorena! Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations! Congratulations, well done, congratulations! Well done. Thirteen hours, twenty-six minutes. -And the other one? -Thirteen hours, twenty-five. Good. I couldn't do it, there was no one to help me. It was very cold. I felt like I was about to collapse, like there was still a long way to run. I was so cold. My sandals hardened and it was bothering me a lot. The problem came when I got wet and my body temperature fell. They feel wrong. I'm not used to running in them. How many miles do those sandals have on them? -I don't know. -How many did you run in Spain? One-hundred-three miles. And how many more miles do they have on them? From running In Guachochi? -Sixty-three miles. -No, 68. -Sixty-eight. -Sixty-eight? Guachochi is a 68-mile race. And another six miles walking around. No, much more... around 18 miles. Plus another 18 miles walking back. They easily have over 300 miles on them. I don't think I'll use them. The people who do... are always running behind me. One, two, three, let's go. Look, we run up here with food, taking care of the owls, running all over the place, up and down. Look. Do you like taking care of the goats? Not so much anymore, because I'm tired when I get home. That's what happens when you travel so much. Do you like taking care of the goats? Yes, you don't tend to the goats anymore. Sometimes. Who does it now? Juana. Let's see if it makes you calm, or sad, or happy. Child, why are you sitting there with your legs crossed? It's night already. It is dark, you can't see anything... Look, at night... there are fireflies. At night. And you can see... they're fireflies! They're fireflies! Come on! Come on! How would you feel... if you had to go live in another country? I would miss it here a lot, living in another country. Six, five, four, three, two, one... Go! Let's go, runners! You're setting an example... for us all. I think people see Lorena as a very strong person, who handles herself well in every race she runs. It's really exciting for her, it's fun. Especially in a family of runners. When you run, are you doing it seriously? When you run, are you doing it seriously? Well, yeah. Yes? Are you sure? She said... -Well done, Lorena! Keep it up! -Come on, Lorena! -Go! Good! Congratulations! -Well done. Keep it up, Lorena! What are you doing, Rarámuri? You're whispering. It's just the fireflies flying. It's their lights. They move their lights. They turn on their lights. Look at the light. Follow the light... in silence. I'll keep running as long as I can... and as long as I have the strength. WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF LORENA RAMÍREZ
