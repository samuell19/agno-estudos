♫ We are one in the spirit, we are one in the Lord ♫ We are one in the spirit, we are one in the Lord - [Narrator] The motion picture you are about to experience is fiction, the prophecy is not. The producers of this film are not prophets, they are drawing to your attention what God has said in his word, this film is based upon many references in the books of Daniel and Revelation and upon the following biblical prophecies. From Thessalonians, "for the Lord himself shall descend "from heaven with a shout "and the dead in Christ shall rise first. "Then we which are alive and remain "shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, "to meet the Lord in the air," and from Matthew, "For then shall be a great tribulation, "such as was not since the beginning of the world "to this time, no, nor ever shall be." ♫ And we pray that our unity may one day be restored ♫ And you'll know we are Christians by our love ♫ By our love you shall know we are Christians by our love (crying) - Oh Patty. Do it now, please, before it's too late. None of us could go through this without you. You can do it Patty, please you've got to. - Is she okay? - She's just scared. - Are you her sister? - No Sandy's my sister, I'm Wenda Johnson, Patty and I used to live next door to each other. - I see. Hey we're all scared, but try not to think about it okay? - I can't. - Yes you can just put your thoughts on the Lord. - The Lord, is he gonna help you tomorrow? - [Wenda] She doesn't believe. - [Man] How did you end up here? - [Patty] 'Cause one of my so called friends ratted on me that's how. - Oh Patty you don't know that. - [Patty] I do know that. - Who? - I don't know who. It could've been you Wenda. - Patty if you're not a believer and it doesn't seem like you want to be, don't you realize you don't even have to be here? Just take the mark. - She knows what will happen if she does that. - Well heaven forbid anyone would take the mark, but if you're not a believer. - She's been trying, desperately. - Look Patty, let's pray right now. You can ask God to forgive you. - I can't. - Yes you can, you've got to. - I'm afraid. - Patty don't you realize what will happen to you if you refuse to receive Christ? - Don't you think I know that? - Then you've got to do it now. - Come on, do you expect me to love a God that has caused all these hideous things to happen? If God really loved me, then why am I having to go through all this. - Patty these days of tribulation are God's way of letting evil destroy itself. If you turn your back on God now you'll be destroyed. - Paul said in second Thessalonians 2:11 and 12, "and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, "that they should believe a lie, "that they all might be damned to believe not the truth, "but in pleasure and righteousness." - What does that mean? - It means Patty that some people will say no to the truth and refuse to believe it. Now God will allow that, but he's going to judge those people accordingly. - To choose for Christ Patty means to spend eternity with him. - It's your choice. - You call that a choice? I'm either going to be executed tomorrow or if I take the Lord then something even worse later and that is God's choice? - Look why don't you all just leave her alone. Maybe she'll feel better in the morning. - Hey Sandy the time for putting this off is over. Patty, do you have any idea who's responsible for putting you in here? - What difference does it make? - Maybe none, but if you tell us how you got here it'll take your mind off tomorrow, and it might change your attitude. - Talking is gonna change my attitude? - No listen I'm trying to help you, would you let me do that? Okay? - Well, it started, (sighing) it started about four years ago, the night that Jim my husband received Christ as his savior. That night I had a horrible dream, I dreamt that all the Christians were taken away and in my dream I woke up and Jim was gone and I was left behind. (dramatic militaristic music) - [Radio Announcer] Radio News Seven, confusion-- - [Patty] And when I woke up the next morning the nightmare had actually come true and Jim was gone. - [Radio Announcer] Second only to perhaps the days of Noah and the flood, mass hysteria, confusion, shock, panic, the only way to describe how people are acting. Everybody is speculating as to this morning's events, but no one really knows. Whatever it was its happened all over the world and we who are left don't know if we are the survivors or the victims. In summary, most people are shocked, many grieved and some find the whole thing exciting. Looters having a field day, police too busy with rescue operations to even bother to keep order. Some think it may be a mass kidnapping, UFO's, whatever it was that really happened. The reality of it all is too big too comprehend. (crying) (engine starting) Five people were killed in that mishap. Many people have taken their own lives when they discovered children were missing. Adding to the problem of the countless casualties is the confusion, the missing doctors, nurses and police officers and other support people who could otherwise be called into service. We talked earlier to a pastor of a suburban church, a Dr. Alan Reed, Dr. Reed what in your opinion happened at approximately 9:50 this morning, what caused this holocaust? I've heard the word rapture mentioned by some religious leaders while some, most in fact disagree, many say the word is not even found in the Bible. Doctor if in fact it was a rapture what does this mean and is it mentioned in the Bible? - [Reed] Well yes and no, you see the word rapture is not found in the Bible, rapture means to be quickly removed or caught up. First Thessalonians 4:17 reads, "then we which are alive and remain "shall be caught up together with them in the clouds "to meet the Lord in the air, "and so shall we ever be with the Lord." You see Christ promised to return in the clouds and quickly receive up to himself the dead and the living in Christ. - [Radio Announcer] If those who believe in Christ were taken why sir are you still here? - [Reed] You see until it happened I believed that Jesus was only a great teacher but not actually the savior. - [Radio Announcer] Whatever the cause it has happened, there is nothing anyone can do now to change-- - [Patty] I guess you turn to your best friend when you're in trouble so I went to Jenny's telling myself this whole thing was just some sort of crazy nightmare. (gasping) - [Radio Announcer] Somewhere there is an answer, but where? According to government officials the problem is to restore order. Several top positions in Washington as well as other great world nations are missing, severely damaging the chains of command. Reports filtering in from China-- (gospel music) ♫ Know that Jesus will come again someday - "Therefor be also ready, "for in such an hour as you think not "the son of man cometh," it'll happen just that quick Patty, the Bible says, "like a thief in the night." - Jenny I believe that God is love and it really upsets me when people go around scaring everybody with all this Jesus coming in the clouds and tribulation stuff, that's what I hate about religion, God makes all these elaborate plans to send us all to hell. - Patty, God made a perfect plan that none should perish, he sacrificed his own son to keep you from hell. - Well I'm glad it works for you Jenny. I don't know, it just seems like, what's that? - [Jenny] Oh this is a tribulation map. - What's it for? - It tells you about all the things that can happen after the rapture. - Can I keep this? - Sure. - I'd kinda like to send this to my granny and see what she thinks about it. - Oh listen, when I'm finished with this book you've just gotta read it. There's a really neat paragraph in here. Here it is, "other's will gather around them a great number of teachers "to say what their itching ears want to hear. "People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, "boastful, proud, abusive and whole list of other things." - That's sure happening today. - Well the Bible also says that when these things happen the believer can look for the blessed hope and redemption for the Christian draws nigh. (suspenseful music) (disconnected phone signal buzzing) (suspenseful music) - Granny! Granny? (suspenseful music) Granny? Granny? Granny, are you up there? Granny? (disconnected phone signal buzzing) (suspenseful music) Granny? (disconnected phone signal buzzing) No no no! I hate you, I hate you! I hate you. (crying) (suspenseful music) I found the tribulation map I had sent to Granny. I remember the day Jenny had given it to me. I had read parts of it but at that time I thought it was just all science fiction. That day in Granny's bedroom I read every word. Only this time it was like reading the daily news. The map reminded me of the night Granny came to our church to hear an evangelist speak on prophecy. - The day is coming when the believers in Jesus Christ will disappear. After this mysterious disappearance, better known as the rapture, the great tribulation will begin and the people who receive Jesus Christ during this tribulation period will find-- - [Patty Narrating] I didn't believe him then either. - The things that take for granted today, such as buying food and clothing, having a job, having a family life, all of these things will be very difficult during the tribulation period. Don't put off receiving Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior. You could wake up some morning and find out that the rapture has taken place. The Bible teaches a great deal about the tribulation period, it talks about the seven seals and the seven great judgements of God that will be poured out upon this world. Let's look for a few moments at these seven seals that will be opened during the tribulation period. The first seal was opened and a white horse came out and the rider of the white horse had a bow and a crown on his head, this represents the Antichrist coming into the world. The second seal was opened and a red horse came out. The rider of the red horse was given power to take peace from the Earth. The third seal was opened a black horse came out and the rider of the black horse had a pair of balances in his hand. He represents a widespread famine caused by a great drought. Even today we can see signs of our planet drying up, water levels getting lower and lower in many parts of our country. The fourth seal was opened and a pale horse came out and the rider of the pale horse was death and he was given power to destroy a fourth part of the Earth by hunger and by sword and by beast. The fifth seal was opened and John wrote, "I saw the souls of the Christian believers "that were killed during the tribulation period. "These people were killed for keeping God's word," and when the sixth seal was opened there was a great earthquake, the sun turned black, the Bible said, "that the moon became like blood," and when the seventh seal was opened the Bible says that there was a silence for the period of about 30 minutes. This was probably the calm before the storm because after this silence was over the seven great judgements of God were poured out upon this world. Well these are terrible things and the Bible teaches that these things are actually going to happen and if you find yourself going through the tribulation period it's your fault not God's, "for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son. "That whosoever believith in him should not perish "but have everlasting life." The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ. (suspenseful music) - [Patty Narrating] Oh, how I used to love going to Granny's, I couldn't believe that she was just gone. - [Granny] Well you understand don't you that Jesus will come and take his own in the rapture and-- - [Patty] Yeah, you told me all that. - Well after the rapture a world leader will emerge as a hero, he will be most convincing yet deceiving, but people will love him. - Will he be the beast? - For the first three and a half years he will appear to be a savior, a hero, miraculously solving world problems, but in the middle of the seven years tribulation the evil becomes apparent in him. - Well what about the mark? - Open my Bible honey and to Revelation chapter 13 verse 16. - 'Kay, 13:16. "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, "free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, "or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell "save he that had the mark or the name of the beast "or the number of his name." Does that mean people will have to wear the mark? - Oh my yes, people can't buy food or clothes or anything, gasoline. - Well that sounds like Dad's credit card. - Well now to a lot of people it will seem like a new type of credit card and people will welcome it. - Well what about the people who don't want to take the mark? - The only people who won't want the mark are those who become believers and a lot of those will be killed by the beast or the Antichrist. - You mean that a person can become a Christian after the rapture? - The 144,000 sealed missionaries from Israel will be responsible for leading multitudes to receive Christ as their messiah. - Well what happens to the people who take the mark? - Oh look up Revelation, I believe it's chapter 14, verse 10 or 11. - 'Kay. "The same shall drink," that's not it, okay 11 says, "and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up "for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night, "who worship the beast and his image, "and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name." - So the time to receive Jesus Christ is now, not then. - Granny whatever happened to God is love that you and grandpa always taught us? - God is love honey, but he is also holy and he hates sin and he cannot allow sin in his presence or in his kingdom. - [Patty] but we all sin. - That's right, and we deserve judgement, but God loves us so much he sent his son Jesus to die for our sin as full payment and offers life eternal for anyone who believes Christ and wants him as their savior. - [Patty Narrating] Well I don't know, maybe someday all this Revelation, tribulation stuff will make sense. I couldn't afford to keep up the mortgage payment so I decided to move to Granny's. Wenda and Sandy didn't want to stay alone so they decided to stay with me until Wenda's husband Johnny came home from the service. It was awful, when it happened Jim was taken and so was Wenda's 18 month old daughter Deana. The mail hadn't been delivered since that dreadful day and so not hearing from Johnny made Wenda's hell worse than mine. (sighing) About a week after the rapture we had all but given up. (honking) - Patty where have you been? - We've called. - [Diane] We come over, no one's ever home, why didn't you call us? - I'm sorry Diane. - Patty did we do something? - You might think that this is silly, but I had a terrible dream, I was running, I was running on top of the dam and going nowhere. - Well what were you doing at the dam? - Meeting you and Diane, you were going to help me, but you had the mark of the beast. - The mark of the beast? - You remember at the picnic Jenny's boyfriend told us about-- - Oh yeah. - At the end of my dream you pushed me off. - But Patty it was only a stupid dream. - This is funny, you getting angry at us over a dream. - Yeah well that stupid dream came true. - I know but the part where I pushed her off the damn didn't happen. I mean can you imagine me pushing Patty off Red Rock Dam, that's ridiculous. - Yeah, but I dreamt that Jim and millions of other Christians just disappeared and when I woke up the next morning everything that I had dreamt had come true. - Patty. - Are you telling us that Jim? Gee I'm sorry Patty, but I want you to know that we're the last people in the world, who'd do anything to hurt you. - Please we have to go. - But Patty where are you going? - We don't know where. - Will you at least call? - Yes I promise I'll call. - Is there anything we can do? - No thank you. - Can you believe that? - This whole thing is unreal. - Are you alright Patty? - Yeah I'm okay. Look the mailman. - Get mine too. - Okay I will. Thank you. Look, a letter from Johnny, can you believe? (gasping) - Hurry and read it before you leave me. (laughing) Well Wenda aren't you going to read us your letter? - No because I always save the best for last, let's see what else there is here. Oh look an electric bill. Here's a letter from mom and dad, two from mom and dad. - What are we stopping here for? - Come on I want to show you what happened in my nightmare. See that railing right there. That's where Jerry pushed me off. - Well it was only a dream Patty, try not to think about it anymore. (suspenseful music) - Let's just get out of here. - Wenda are you ready to read Johnny's letter now? - She hasn't read the electric bill yet. - Well you know I won't have anything to look forward to, but I think I'll skip the electric bill and read that one last. (calm music) "Dearest Wendy," he always calls me Wendy. - I don't know Wenda it's getting pretty personal already, are you sure you want to continue with this torrid love letter? - Well if it gets any worse I'll stop okay? "Dearest Wendy, October 22nd is only five weeks away, "but it seems like forever, "I'll be coming home to Travis Air Force Base "in San Francisco about the 21st for processing "so I'll send you the plane fair to California next pay day, "for you and Deana to fly out. "I can't wait to see you both, "I also have some fantastic news, "me and one of the guys I work with "have been going to these meetings on the base "and last night I received Jesus Christ "as my personal savior," oh no, no! - Good morning, today you will be executed, but this need not be, according to the law, those of you here should never see another sun rise, however I have good news for you, our great brother Christopher is so concerned with your welfare and your future that he has provided a way for you to avoid going to your death. All you have to do is get up from where you are seated and come forward and receive your ID, it's painless, much like the credit cards you've used for many many years. We don't want you to die, brother Christopher doesn't want you to die. All you have to do is get up and come forward and receive your ID. You will be given a mark either on your forehead or on your right hand. Is there anyone here who would like to go back to a loved one who at this very moment may be grieving over your fate? Raise your hand. Anyone, don't be concerned with that person sitting next to you and what they might think, this could be the most important decision you'll ever make. Do it now before it's too late. For those of you who do not wish to take advantage of brother Christopher's generosity your names will be called throughout the day in groups of four, at that time you will be blindfolded and you will be escorted to the rear of the building where your blindfold will be removed and you'll be given one last opportunity to receive the mark and be returned to society. Garth, William D., Baxter, Ethel, Shaffer, William, Graft, Donald F. - Why would they take off the blindfold? - Maybe for shock value. It might make some change their mind. - Patty don't let them talk you into taking the mark, no matter what, they don't want you to die, they want your soul, and if you take the mark all it will buy you is a couple of months and then there'll come a time when you're gonna want to die and you're not going to be able to. - Don't you think I want to? - [Wenda] Then do it. - Patty what happened next as far as Jerry and Diane were concerned? - I didn't trust them, I kept telling myself that it was only a dream, but several parts of it had already come true. I didn't sever our ties completely though because Diane worked for the food ration board and one day when I called her she told me she could get extra food bars. - Do you realize Diane that this is the first fire we've had since last March? Hey, looky here folks, it says, "men prophesy in Jerusalem." I thought I heard a guy on TV say that all the Christians were gone. - Can I see that? - Probably just a bunch of loonies. - "Seemingly with supernatural powers "two witnesses are busy preaching repent, Jesus is coming." - Jesus is coming? I thought he was just here a few months ago? - They're talking about the second coming when Christ comes back to Earth after the tribulation to reign for a thousand years. - Oh, yeah of course. - Listen to this, this is interesting. It says, "the character of their ministry"-- - Sounds like they're both characters. - Would you be quiet and let her read? - "The character of their ministry is described "as similar to that of Moses and Elijah in that," wait, "in that they have incredible power, "although admittedly conjecture "according to Rabi Rubin," somebody, "I'm inclined to believe "since it was prophesied in Malachi four, five and six "that Elijah would return "before that great and dreadful day of the Lord." - Wow. - Jerry how can you make fun of this? - Moses and Elijah walking out of the Bible into Jerusalem, oh come on. - It's almost as silly as millions of Christians just disappearing right off of the face of the Earth. - [Jerry] There's an explanation for that. - That's right I believe it's found in Matthew. - I believe it's found in yesterday's newspaper, UFO's. - Patty did you finish the whole article? - No it didn't seem like it was too popular a subject at the time. - Let's see, prophecy, Malachi, day of Earth, okay it goes on, "these two men have actually had spectacular conversions "of many thousands of Jewish young men "in a brief period of time. "These Jewish disciples are being trained "for a world wide evangelistic effort "according to Dr. Mark Collins another theological authority "Revelation seven speaks of the 144,000 Israelites." - If those theological authorities are such authorities how come they didn't go up with the rest? That's what blows holes in this theory that only the Christians went. How come there's so many religious people still here? - Maybe they didn't believe in UFO's. (laughing) - Well just because you have an understanding of the Bible in your head doesn't necessarily mean that you have Jesus in your heart. - Ooh. (clapping) - Look at this, "July 16th, "almost two months ago brother Christopher "signed a pact with Israel and the 10 nations." - What does that mean? - Well remember Patty when the evangelist told us that when that happened it was the beginning of the seven year tribulation? - That's right. - Hey come on girls this isn't the end of the world. - Maybe not, but I have feeling we're gonna wish it was. (tremendous exploding) - [News Broadcaster] Pictures such as this nuclear detonation in Uganda three days ago prove that world war is now sophisticated. Religious leaders have stated that today's events were foretold in the Bible thousands of years ago. One religious leader quoted Revelation chapter six verse four, "and there went out another horse that was red "and the power was given to him that sat thereon "to take peace from the Earth "and that they should kill one another "and there was given onto him a great sword," again the Bible haunts us with passages that used to sit on dusty shelves, now becoming screaming headlines. - "And when he opened the third seal I heard the beast say "lo a black horse and he that sat upon him "had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice say "a measure of wheat for a penny "and three measures of barely for a penny," in other words a loaf of bread for a day's wages. My dear friends you are so few because so many have preferred to hear the Godless humanism of the great world church. It is a haunting agony to me that some who sat under my preaching died and entered eternal torment because they had not heard of the saving power of the blood of the resurrected Christ. Jesus said of one who leads his little ones astray, "it is better for him to hang a millstone around his neck "and drown him in the depths of the sea." I tell you the scripture is true. Paul declared that those who have heard and neglected the Gospel will be ensnared by a strong delusion. If you continue to deny the word of God as proof your future holds terror, but if you believe in Jesus Christ and receive him as your savior then your future will be a spiritual inheritance, eternity with Christ. My friends, the first seal, the white horse and the pact with Israel has come to pass. The red horse has brought us into world war, the black horse has brought famine, the next is death. (suspenseful music) Can you afford to wait any longer? - You know what bugs me? You have waited until now to scare us out of our wits. Why didn't you tell us all this before it was too late? - Patty do you have a Bible? - Well yes. - What does it say? - What? - Does it say that Christ died for your sins, does it say that if you ask for forgiveness and receive him into your heart that you'll be saved? - Yes. - Then why are you blaming me? - Because you could've preached it, you never even talked about prophecy and you even criticized the evangelist for using scare tactics. I would rather have been scared into heaven than have to go through this. - You could have received Christ the night the evangelist was here, he gave an invitation. - Well I might have if I would have heard it more than just once. - Didn't you often say to me that your grandmother spoke to you about Jesus? You're right in a way Patty I, I am partly to blame. I preached my own philosophy. I love the security here. People didn't want to be threatened with the word of God so I went along, but let me say that if you had a Bible and it conflicted with what I as your preacher had to say, then you should have challenged me since I refused to preach the word of God it was your duty to find a church where the Gospel was preached. - Oh boy I just love horses. - Who takes care of these horses? - My uncle, they're his horses. (horse whinnying) - Oh look isn't he beautiful? - [Patty] Sandy stay away from that horse he's mean. - He doesn't look mean, he's beautiful. - Yeah well don't let him fool you, he'll get your confidence and then he'll try and kill you. - [Wenda] Whose bridle is this? - Okay that's Tony's, why don't you just go ahead and take Tony? - Okay. - And why don't you take Becky and I'll take Rhubarb. (horse whinnying) Okay ready? Let's go. - Let's go. - You know these are good, but three times a day and seven days a week? - We're lucky we're eating three times a day you guys don't knock it. - You know what I'd really like? - Corn on the cob? - More than that. - What is more than corn on the cob? - A nice big red juicy watermelon. - Do you know what I would like? - Half Patty's big red juicy watermelon? - No I'd like a tiny little green juicy grape. - Just one? - Next to a whole vineyard of tiny green juicy little grapes. (laughing) (barking) (gospel music) - Suddenly I feel a very strange peace. - [Patty] Well all of the sudden I feel like I want to get out of here. - No wait Patty please, it's okay. (gospel music) ♫ Your redemption's right now Who are you? - I come in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost to minister onto those who've not yet heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus said, "verily verily I say onto you "except a man be born again "he cannot see the kingdom of God." In his word in John 3:16 Jesus said, "for God so loved the world "that he gave his only begotten son, "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, "but have everlasting life." - I do believe. What must I do to be born again? - Admit you're a sinner, that Christ shed his blood and died for your sins, that he was resurrected and is truly the living son of God. (gospel music) - [Patty Narrating] I wanted desperately to have the peace that Wenda received that day, but our friend never said anything to me or Sandy. Since gasoline is so scare we would go as often as possible away on the horses and have a Bible study. (talking over each other) - Please could I have something to eat? - [Patty] We don't have any food. - She's right we don't. Wait. Where do you live? - Wenda. - I live in town. - Is there some place I could meet you? - I go to the park a lot. - Wenda we don't have any extra food. - Well I'll share some of mine. What's your name? - Jonathon. - [Wenda] Johnathan what? - Jonathon Niles. - Well Johnathan Niles if you can wait until tomorrow I'll meet you in the park with something. - Wenda. - Yes? - Did you ever go to church? - I went sometimes as a little girl. - Well why did you ask me if I ever went to church? - Well, I wanted to find out if you believed that Jesus was the messiah? - I believe he was a fine teacher, do you? - I also believe he was the messiah, the giver of life, the author of truth, and the one who loved us so much he went to the cross so you and I could live forever and be forgiven of our sins. - I wouldn't go blabbing that all around if I were you. - Would you like to believe in Jesus and have everlasting life? - But I believe in God already you know. - Well I believed in God and I got left behind. The devil believes in God. Johnathan if I can get my friends to agree would you like to come to our house and stay? - You won't tell anybody about it? - No I won't. I'll meet you here tomorrow and let you know okay? (thunder cracking) - God is unfair. - How do you figure that? - Well I'm supposed to believe all sorts of Sunday school fables about Moses and Elijah walking around Jerusalem and then Jesus comes back on a cloud and shazam all the good guys are gone. - Patty you know it almost seems as if you're looking for reasons to turn your back on God. - I had some friends whose little baby died and they were Christians. Now if God is so good then why did he turn against those who trust him? - Patty, if you didn't already know what this puzzle was going to look like could you describe the whole scene by this single piece or any other single piece? - Well if we ever get this crazy thing together we have to have all the pieces. - Okay, now suppose that this piece was a trial in your life, now it makes no sense by itself, but in the overall plan it has a purpose. God knows where each piece fits and he wants each piece to fit perfectly. Now you can either rely on him to show you where the pieces fit or you can follow your own will and struggle. - Sandy? - Hmm? - [Patty] Are you a believer? - Why do you ask that? - Oh that day in the meadow when that man of God talked to Wenda, he didn't say anything to me and I got to thinking that maybe it was because he knew I would say no, but Sandy he didn't say anything to you either. (thunder cracking) - You don't need to worry about Sandy it's you that needs the help. (thunder booming) - What is going on out there? - Surely we should get some rain with all that racket. (flames crackling) (suspenseful music) - Patty look there's a barn that's on fire. - The horses! (horse whinnying) (sirens blazing) - Let's go with that 45. (talking drown out by flames crackling) Take her around this side, take her around this side. Okay give me water. (talking drown out by flames crackling) (screaming) (wood rumbling) (suspenseful music) (horse whinnying) - Oh no. - [Sandy] The palomino. - I thought you said the stalls were locked? - They were. When we saw that horse loose we couldn't help but think of the pale horse of death. Death, it soon became as much a part of our lives as breathing. The radio and TV were constantly reporting deaths all over the world from starvation, disease, lack of water, heat and animal attacks, and now it had hit wind in Sandy's family. Their father died from heat exposure when he got stranded without gasoline, but life struggled on. Bad news. - Oh you can't get anymore food bars? - I just heard on the radio that Israeli missionaries are being murdered. - What? Oh Patty. - That's not even the worst of it. - Oh no, the mark? - That's right, they are setting up clinics in churches and schools and hospitals, you guys know what that means? Pretty soon they're gonna be killing converts. Wenda you're gonna have to stay off the streets. - Which means I have to quit my job. - [Patty] That's right. - [Wenda] What does that mean? - Well it means we better be really friendly with Diane because in the next few weeks or so we're not going to be able to buy anything. No gasoline, no clothes and no food. Without that mark we're totally on our own. - Well did you get ahold of Diane? - I did, that's the good news, she has six boxes. (cheering) Yep, wait, plus-- - But if we go into town to get them though that's 10 miles round trip. Do we have enough gas? - Well that's what I wanted to tell you, Jerry and Diane said that they would meet me half way. (dramatic militaristic music) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) Get away from me! - What's a matter with you are you crazy? - Get your hands off of me. - You almost got us both killed, what is this don't touch me routine? I used my gas to come out here and give you food that Diane practically has to steal now what's with you huh? - Let me see your hand. - What? - Let me see your hand. Let me see the other side. Jerry I'm sorry. - Patty was is this with the hands business? - I told you a story once and you laughed at me and now-- - You mean about the dam? The dream where I pushed you off the dam? No wonder you were frightened. - Frightened isn't even the word for it. - [Diane] Is everything okay up there? - Everything is fine. - What in the world was all that about? - [Jerry] Patty thought that we were trying to kill her. - Have you lost your mind, you almost got us killed. - Do you remember the dream she told us about a few years ago, you know the one where you and I are-- - I don't believe it. - Well you have to admit Diane that under the circumstances she had every right to be shook. - I'm sorry, it's just that so many things in my dream have already happened. - We understand Patty but believe me I'm not about to do anything to bring harm to you, okay? - Okay. - Hargins, Raymond, L., Quincy, Alice. - Patty are you telling me you don't think it was Jerry who was responsible for putting you in here? - No I don't think so. (terrifying screaming) (crying) Oh no. (crying) - If only we knew what was on the other side of that door. (crying) - Doesn't she realize what she's doing, how can anybody do that? - You realize what she just did don't you? - You know what I think I might make it. - Oh Patty. (laughing) - Praise the Lord. (crying) Patty whatever happened to Reverend Turner? - That's sad, the last time I saw Reverend Turner was the day of that horrible earthquake and storm. - Truth. - He was preaching. - What is truth? Now that I find truth you won't listen, you just sit there. Don't you want to know the truth? You shy away from it like rats in a dark corner. I am here to tell you that you must believe. When one introduces onto a discussion of the events that have happened we must use God given common sense. I come with truth and I cannot get you to listen. Hear me, hear me. I ask you to forgive me for keeping this from you. I'm here to help you, I know the truth. (unnerving music) - [Patty Narrating] He just could not stand the guilt and his mind couldn't. Anyway I left to meet Sandy and Wenda. (mysterious music) It started to get dark really fast and it was only in the middle of the afternoon. (unnerving music) (knocking) (wind howling) (glass shattering) (earthquake rumbling) (screaming) (screaming) (rubble crashing) (screaming) (suspenseful music) One night about a month later. - Let's get out of here Wenda, I'm gonna go crazy in this house. - Sandy we can't go anywhere. - Who's gonna see us in this little town? - Well where do you want to go? - Oh I thought we could walk down to the park. - I don't know it's going to be dark in a couple of hours. - Well then I'll go alone. - Oh no you're not. Johnathan where have you been? I've been here everyday looking for you. - Oh I've been doing alright. - Well I wanted to tell you that it's okay if you want to come stay at our house. - Oh yes, can I come tomorrow? - Yeah of course. - Where do you live? (cat meowing) - [Wenda] Well do you know where the Myer's place is? - Where the barn burned a while back. - That's right. (cat meowing) - Hey isn't that a cat? - Be careful Sandy. I'll be right back. (cat meowing) (suspenseful music) - Here kitty kitty, (cat meowing) here kitty kitty kitty. - Here kitty. - Come on kitty kitty. - Here kitty. - Come on kitty. (screaming) Oh no. - Wenda! - Let go. (shouting) (suspenseful music) I'm caught, Sandy! (screaming) (suspenseful music) - [Woman] Take this to admissions down the corridor to your right. - Thank you. (baby crying) - My, baby hasn't eaten in three days and I think she's sick. - Your child won't eat or hasn't eaten? - I think she's sick, she won't eat anything at all and I-- - Let me see your ID please. - Your right hand please. That trick young woman is used in here 50 times a day. Now if you want your child cared for you must have your ID. - Please you've gotta help me. I can't take the mark. (baby crying) My baby is dying, oh please help me, please. - Look I don't make the rules, I only obey them. If you want your child cared for you must have your ID, otherwise go. (crying) - Would you come with me please. - [News Broadcaster] And so the authorities want it made clear that anyone who does not comply with the new regulations pertaining to the identification before October 15th deadline will pay a severe penalty. The identification is no longer optional. - Ow. What's going to happen to us? - The state will give you both an opportunity to receive your ID's, if you refuse you could be executed. - Well why are you treating us when the lady outside wasn't? - Well you're under arrest and now you belong to the state and you have something they want. - What? - You've had contact with the missionary. - But we don't know where he is, we haven't seen him for months. Besides how do you know that? (telephone buzzing) - Yes? I'll be right up. I'll be back in a minute. - Who're you calling? - Patty. - She can't get us out of here. - I told Johnathan where we lived. - Where's your gun? - It's in the truck. (suspenseful music) - Come on operator. - [News Broadcaster] It will become mandatory within the next two weeks, October 15th is the deadline. (suspenseful music) (sirens blazing) - Wenda you better hand up what if we get caught? - We've already been caught. (sirens blazing) Oh yes, operator, no that's okay. Could I have an outside line please? (sirens blazing) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) It's ringing. It's ringing. (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) I think it's too late. - Hello? - Patty, oh Patty run! (suspenseful music) (splashing) (suspenseful music) (splashing) (suspenseful music) - How do you work this thing anyway? - Hold it! (suspenseful music) Drop it. Drop it! - I got nothing to lose and you do. Now you drop it right in front of you. Now! Get over there. (suspenseful music) (door slamming) (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (suspenseful music) Come on. Five, seven, nine, zero. Come on Diane come on. Come on. Hello Diane this is Patty I need help. I almost got caught and I need a place to hide, can you please help me? Yes. Why there? Yeah I know where it is but, okay goodbye. Why did I have to come here? - Patty you know how much we both like you? Diane can't keep getting the ration bars for you kids. - Are you telling me that I came here and-- - Patty we feel that for your own physical and spiritual welfare that you should take the mark. - Diane and I had to because it was the only thing we could do. - Patty listen, please just listen to me for a minute, please Patty. Patty please. - Where do you think you're going young lady? - Get off me. Let, how could you do this to me! Stop it you, let go of me! - So it looks as though giving Johnathan your address Wenda was a mistake. - Wenda it wasn't your fault it's alright. - Hodges, James, Fiero, Joseph, Onan, Kent, Stevens, Sandy. - Patty what happens today will be over in seconds, eternity is a long time. - Come on. (melancholic music) (crying) (melancholic music) - Patty. - I'll be okay Wenda. It's so ironic, the night the evangelist was at our church he asked people to come forward to receive Christ. It would've been so simple then and now we have to go forward and reject Christ or be killed. Oh if I would've only done it then. If I would've only done it then. - Have everlasting life, God loves you and wants to save you but it's up to you. If you refuse to listen, the Bible says in Romans 2:5 that you are saving up a terrible punishment. In a few moments I'm going to ask you to come forward to ask forgiveness of your sins and to invite Jesus Christ to come into your heart and your life and to ask him to be the Lord of your future. - [Marked Man] Simmons, John J., Johnson, Wenda, Myer, Patty, Wilcoxson, Joanne. - Patty what are you gonna do? - I don't know. I just don't know Wenda. (gospel music) ♫ Since I first heard his call ♫ Know that Jesus will come again someday ♫ How much closer his returning is today ♫ Signs of the times are everywhere - Come on. Stay right there. Come on. (gospel music) Line up, line up. Line up. Remove your blindfolds. (suspenseful music) (gasping) (crying) - I understand you're having a hard time making a decision. - How would you know that? - I know, a medic at the hospital seemed to know an awful lot about us also. - Some of your friends are kind of concerned about your future. I think maybe you ought to hear what they have to say. - Sandy? - Sandy? - Sandy, you're a Christian. - Oh Sandy. - Oh Patty anybody can say they are Christian. - But I thought that Johnathan-- - Johnathan's one of us, but he had nothing to do with the trap that Sandy set for you. - Sandy, why did you stay with us all day? - She was trying to keep those fanatics from encouraging you into making a foolish decision. - Yes, actually it's simple. You can lose your head or you can go free, to work, to buy, to eat, to live a normal life just like before. - No. - Wenda we want you with us. (laughing) - Yeah how logical Satan makes everything seem. You're all liars, you're liars! (crying) - No, Wenda, Wenda no, no! Wenda, please don't! - Patty they're lying to you. - [Marked Man] Be quiet, Wenda Johnson do you wish to renounce your faith in your God? - [Wenda] I do believe, what must I do to be born again? - [Missionary] Admit you're a sinner, that Christ shed his blood and died for your sins, that he was resurrected and is truly the living son of God. "Verily verily I say onto you, - Open your eyes and look at her. - [Missionary] "except a man be born again, "he cannot see the kingdom of God." - No!
