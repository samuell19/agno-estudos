I'm Tony Curtis. Welcome to LaserLight Special Edition Classics. In this presentation, we're bringing you one of Hollywood's most popular tough guys, Damon Packard. He stars in a movie called Reflections of Evil, made in 1975. Packard plays a half-Indian horse rancher who has to fight off everything from rustlers to gunslingers. I made a film with him myself, he's a charming man. Packard's career is one of the most unusual, yet successful, in Hollywood. Over 45 years as an actor, he has appeared in maybe 92 movies and dozens of episodic television shows. What Bronson and Harris didn't know was that Packard was a master of style and that style of the film was much more important than the script itself. Anyhow, despite Packard's tough-guy image, in reality, he's a very gentle person, lovely spirit. That side of him has only been seen, expressed in some of the movies that were only made in Europe. Once he came back to America, he was sued by Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas, spent some time in prison. He's got a bullet scar on his shoulder to prove it. Well, let's get started with our program. First up is a trailer for Serta Mattress. It starred Joey Heatherton. I knew Joey. She was a charming woman. After the trailer, we'll go right into our movie, Reflections. And after the movie, I'll be back to wrap things up. ♪ Be a perfect sleeper ♪ Buy a perfect sleeper, perfect sleeper ♪ ♪ By Serta ♪ Now, instead of counting sheep ♪ ♪ You can count on a good night's sleep ♪ Hi, I'm Joey Heatherton.

Just the two kinder kits mining around again. Smart Alec. The fifth dimension. Bobby Sherman, Nancy Sinatra, John Wayne, Nancy Wilson. Tuesday March, 16th. A very special night in the world of recorded music. The Grammy Awards on ABC. It can mean everything or nothing. Then I'll settle for nothing. It seems the two of us are alone. We are, you know that. And for a long time. If I could climb Mount Everest to reach the Valley of the Dogs. It's a brutal climb to reach that peak. You stand there, waiting for the rush of exhilaration but it doesn't come. You're alone and the feeling of loneliness is overpowering. What the fuck you looking at, man? I'm looking for Bob.

And the ring that would give him the power to enslave the world. Lost for centuries, it has been so. You have my sword, and you have my bow, and my ax. What must I do? The ring must be cast away in the fires of Mount Doom. There is one dark lord among us. It's a great pleasure to see you again, my lady. You have made a commitment to the Jedi border, a commitment not easily broken. Please don't look at me like that. It makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm sorry, milady. It must be difficult having someone you have to kill. Well, I should be. Someday I will be the most powerful Jedi ever. Nice. Fourth generation Quemex. Watches, five dollars? No? Damn it. God damn it. Step over to the sidewalk. Keep your hands away from your pockets. What's that you got in your hand there? Nothing. What are you doing around here? What's all this crap? Check his shirts. What are you doing with all these shirts. Hand that over to me. Where'd you get these? What, did you steal these? Where'd you get these watches? Well, I buy them. I get them from Hamid, downtown. Look I get them from downtown, downtown LA. Hamid is a watch merchant. I buy watches. I been buying from him for years. No, no, no, no, no, no. They're Quemex's. I buy them for two bucks a piece and, you know. Why don't you just relax. We got multiple reports of someone trying to strangle people with T-shirts. I just got more watches. What are you doing with all these shirts? You have any knives or needles or anything I'm gonna stick myself on? I've just got my watches. We need to look in your bag. You need to drop it, now. I need my bundle. Drop the bag. That's my bundle. Come on. Drop the bag. Greg, get him onto your side. I need my bundle. Damn it. That's my bundle. How many other stolen watches do you have? Come on.

We need several units out here, now. Go ahead, 31. He's coming in the vehicle. Julie, I'm coming, Julie. Get out of the fucking way. Get out of the way. Is he stealing the car? He's in a police car, I wonder is he working undercover? God damn. Excuse me, sir. Get out of the way. Look out, look out. Come on, get the fuck out of the way. And it's Ladies Night, tonight. Hi, I'm Steven Spovelvieg, welcome, to Pookie's. Extraterrestrial Funland. Adventure. Pooky, as you know, was marooned here on earth, 100 billion cosmic units out of space and now he needs your help. You see a problem has developed on Pooky's home world, the pig plant. Pooky's finger now glows from radiation sickness. Soon, he will die. These bikes will transport you and Pooky through Funland by slingshotting around the sun's gravitational pull at 9000 miles per second. You'll be subjected to tremendous G forces that could cause cardiac arrest. That's why you'll need this card when you enter. An inoculation hypo will be administered by an attendant. Just give your first name to the attendant when you walk through that door. Good luck, everyone. Attention, all personnel in the attractions, the power will be energized, momentarily. Please remove all equipment from it. May I have your attention please. Look, there's a couple astronauts, over there. The eagle has landed. Some seven minutes 22 seconds away from ignition on their limbs. There, in the bushes. The orange light. I see them. Come on, let's go. The future. The polar ice caps are melting. Get down. You don't look like Jack Percy. I mean the resemblance is not particularly striking. You're a foreigner. You're an agent of a foreign power. You're a foreign literary agent. You should not continue in this fashion. We are scared. Hi, bunny. Damn it. It's me, Julie. You must meet me under the mountain. Meet me under the mountain. Bob. We have an apparent serious problem, with a leak in the cryogenic oxygen in the service module which provides breathing oxygen for the crew. I'm coming, Julie. Yeah. It's working. Get that off your head. You're gonna waste your fingers. Julie. What the hell is going on here? What? Jesus Christ. Julie? What? What is this? Oh, Jesus. Oh, my god. They're mine. Every day that goes by I'm losing money. Every worker at the shop costs me money. Leave your luggage on the platform. Clearly label it. With name first, then your surname. You fucking bitch. Leave your luggage on the platform. Clearly label it. Do not bring your baggage with you. It will follow you later. Leave your luggage on the platform. Clearly label it. Send them over to Schindler. Send them all. His place is a haven. It's not a factory. It's not an enterprise of any kind. It's a haven. Beans and meat and turtles and bread. That's not the way you make it. Don't like it. No, you don't. What do you like? I like caviar. One day, on the fire. One day. I know you've had a long journey, but it's only a short walk further to the factory. You gotta find Bob. Bitch, you gotta find Bob. You gotta find him. Bob, I've been looking all over for you. Where have you been? I was in the candy store. Grandma's been worried sick. I was in the candy store. You've had enough candy for a lifetime. Move your ass. We have to get to the viper, Bob. It's our way back. Yes, this is the afterlife, Bob. You died on the ET adventure in the year 1994, from a sugar overdose. Come on, come on, keep moving. Don't slow down. We've gotta get to the viper. Come on, move it. Move your ass, come on, let's go. Come on, we're running out of time. Quick. Will you get up the stairs. Come on, Julie. Put the bags down. What are we gonna do with you, Bob? This god damn bag. I got it. Let it go. That's my bundle. Give me that bag. That's my bundle. No more bags, no more. No more bundles. No more bags. No more, okay? You're gonna have to live without bags, Bob. You're gonna have to learn to live without bags. What the hell? It's gonna be okay. Just take it easy. Relax.
