[music] [Spike] OK, OK. Here's a blue one! Purple! And a gray one! Oh, oh, you should put some up in those branches! Higher! Higher! [Spike] And here's a yellow one! Where should I put this one? I know, that carrousel! Great idea! Igor, Esme, look! We have sparklies! Aren't they pretty? Is that dragon-fire? It is! The little sparks represent the start of something new. How perfect! The first night of spring is all about new things and beginnings. Our family always has a Sparklies Hunt to celebrate first night. Almost. This year, his siblings have an MMA tournament. M-M-A? Mixed Monster Arts. Oh, how exciting! MMA is fun, but a Sparklies Hunt is even funner! Spike's dad took our older kids to the tournament, and Spike and I planned this treasure hunt for the Super Monsters. We hid sparklies all over the park. Come on, Mom, we still have to hide the rest of them! I'm hiding the sparklies for the Super Monsters who fly. And I'm hiding them for everyone else. Say, Spike, would you like me to hide some of the sparklies? If you don't know where they are, you can play too. No, thank you, Igor. I don't mind not playing. Besides, hiding the treasure is the best part! All done! Perfect timing, look! Happy First Night, everybody! I'm so happy Spring has sprung! Indeed! That smells wonderful! What did you bring? My abuelita made quesadillas! And my dad made Transylvanian "ghoul-lash." Enchiladas. Potato salad! Egg salad! Baked beans! [Abuelita] Fruit salad! [Count Dracula] Corn salad! Pumpkin mole, made with Mexican chocolate. Cozonac cu nuca, made with Romanian walnuts! Three bean casserole, made with real magic beans! Tiramisu, made with real lady fingers! -Ah! -Ah! Would anyone care for a bite? Thanks, Dad! Ladyfingers are my favorite cookies! Oh, ladyfinger cookies! Of course! What did you think they were? -[Mrs. Gong] Cookie? -[Igor] Oh, yes. [speaking Spanish] Gracias. Frankie is here! [Lobo] There's Katya, Cleo and Zoe! [Esme] The decorating committee is here! [Esme chuckles] [Igor chuckles] [background music] -[all] Hi! -[Lobo] Hi, happy First Night! [background music] I forgot the extension cord! [Zoe chuckles] It's OK, Daddy, they still look really pretty! Wow! Wow! Excellent! Looks like our First Night celebration is ready to begin! And just in time, too. Sun down! [all] Monsters up! Drac! Katya. Lobo! [Lobo howls] Frankie! Zoe. [music] Cleo! Spike! [all] Super Monsters! -[Glorb laughs] -[Cleo chuckles] Goodness, you two have really been cooking up a storm! We have, and speaking of storms... Could you give us a little help with the weather, your Highness? I'd be happy to! Although, I do love a nice spring rain shower. So do I, but I do not like rain on my elotes, it makes the queso soggy. Cleo, I think I'm going to need some help. We've got this! [both] Mummy power! [background music] Ah-hah! [Abuelita sighs] -Thank you! -[speaking Spanish] Gracias. -Great job, mommy! -Thank you, Cleo. I couldn't have done it without you. Cleo is getting so good at controlling her mummy powers. [Cleopatra] You should see her at the petting zoo! She's been using her wind power to help Griffy learn to fly! Oh, that reminds me. Dr. Jekyll planned a First Night picnic for the Monster Pets! They'll be in the park later tonight. I can't wait to see Griffy! I promised I'd give him another flying lesson. -[all] Yay! -The Monster Pets are so sweet! And so fun! Henri loves playing with the Wingoats Bubble and Trouble. Don't you, Henri? -[Henri purrs] -[Katya chuckles] Oh! [Lobo sniffs] Mmm. What is that? It's called Cozonac cu nuca. It's a Romanian sweet bread. -Would you like a-- -[Lobo gulps] Oh, yum! Lobo! Well-behaved werewolves do not snatch things out of other people's hands or paws! You need to try to be more patient! Sorry, Abuelita. I'm sorry, Count Dracula. I accept your apology, young werewolf. Now, what did you think of the walnut bread? It was delicious! Would you like a taste? I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the recipe. [speaking Spanish] Mmm. Muy sabroso. [everyone cheering] I love sack races! Me too! Remember, the secret to winning the water balloon toss is to be slow and gentle. U-huh, got it! Oops! Whoa! Oh, oh, oh! Doh! [Cleo laughs] Lobo! Oops! Sorry, Mrs. Mash. OK, who's ready to play bat-boomerang-golf? Me! This park is the best place to play bat-boomerang-golf. It's so big and wide, I can really get my speed on! OK, Drac, ready when you are. Let's go, let's go! Come on, Drac, throw the boomerang. Oh, bats! I forgot to bring it. [Henri meows] It's OK, Drac, we still have sack races and water balloons. My mom and I planned a special game too. [Drac gasps] Really? What is it? It's a sparklies hunt! [everyone] Oh, sounds cool! Sparklies hunt? Yeah! What's a sparklies hunt? It's like an Easter Egg hunt, but instead of eggs, we hide dragon sparklies. Like this one! [everyone] Oh! Every dragon family makes up their own rules for treasure hunts. In our family, the first rule is to have fun. -I like that rule! -[everyone chuckles] You each get to keep all of the sparklies that you find. And the first monster to collect eight sparklies wins a special prize! The prize is a dragon jewel, made with real dragon magic. -[everyone gasps] -[Zoe] So pretty! Wow, awesome! [Henri purrs and meows] [Zoe chuckles] I think Henri really wants that prize. Henri! If we win, we can put the dragon jewel on your collar! Henri is super excited! Nothing's more exciting than a dragon treasure hunt! Well, in that case, what are we waiting for? Let's get started! Ready, set, go! Let's go, Henri! Yeah! Even my treasure hunting moves have moves! [Glorb pants] I spy with my zombie eye. -[owl hoots] -[Zoe chuckles] I'm ready to win. Fast, fast, fast! [Lobo laughs and howls] Lobo! You have to slow down, or you'll miss all the sparklies! Well, we did say the first rule is to have fun. He's definitely having fun. [Spike and Mrs. Gong laugh] ♪ Dragon sparklies glow ♪ ♪ And moon flowers bloom ♪ ♪ It's the first night of spring ♪ ♪ Under the monster moon ♪ ♪ A wondrous night of magic ♪ ♪ And big dragonflies ♪ ♪ We monsters celebrate tonight ♪ ♪ Under rays of monster moon light ♪ -[Lobo howls] -[Frankie stomps] ♪ Woo! In delight! ♪ ♪ All the werewolves howl ♪ ♪ And the chanting too ♪ ♪ It's the first night of spring ♪ ♪ Under the monster moon ♪ [Lobo howls] I found three sparklies! -[Katya] So did we! -[Henri meows] I found four! Two for me! I found three, but I'm going to keep looking. Me too. Spike, you did a really good job hiding those sparklies. I didn't find any. Well, Lobo, you were running so fast, you didn't even look. Running fast is the best part. [Lobo howls] [everyone chuckling] Hunting sparklies is so much fun! Henri and I are going to go look for more. Spike, you and your mom made a really great game. I'm having so much fun, and I want to keep playing. But, I promised I'd help Griffy with his flying lessons tonight. Why not do both? You can help Griffy practice flying-- And Griffy can help you look for sparklies! That's a great idea! [Glorb squeaks] Oh, Glorb, I'm sorry you didn't find any sparklies. Do you want me to give you a hint? [Glorb squeaks] [Spike] OK, if you're sure. [Glorb squeaks] Sparkly! Sparkly! [background conversations] [Mr. Howler] Hola, mamá. [background music] Wow, this food looks amazing! [speaking Spanish] Gracias, mamá. Gracias, señor Dracula. [Count Dracula] A monster moon! On the first night of spring? I wonder if... Oh, wouldn't that be something? [Sammy giggles] Hello, Mrs. Snow! Hello, Sammy! Sammy, why don't you come with me while your mommy gets something to eat? Have fun, cutie pie! [all] Oh, Sammy! [Sammy giggles] [Sammy gasps] Sammy! I've been working on a new magic trick, just for you. [Sammy babbles] Watch me pull a bunch of snow flowers out of my hat! Abra-Kada-- What? -[Wingoats bleat] -[Drac gasps] -[Sammy babbles] -[Wingoats bleat] Oh, bats! I'll let Dr. Jekyll know that Bubble and Trouble are over here. [Momo squeaks] You're right. Those Wingoats really love making mischief. Just like you. Stop that! Leave that! [goats bleat] [Abuelita] Don't eat that! Those little Wingoats are the silliest things I've seen! [neighbor] Hello, happy spring! [Katya giggles] Mom, look! Henri and I found five sparklies! That's wonderful, Katya. Henri is really good at spotting the sparklies. Henri, I had no idea you were so good at treasure hunting! [Henri meows and purrs] [Momo teases Henri] Momo, stop teasing Henri. [Henri meows] [Momo teases Henri] [Katya and Ms. Spelling giggle] [background music] Hello, Amy! Hi, Katya! Hello! Hi, Dr. Jekyll! Hello, Henri. Hi, Momo. -[Momo squeaks] -[Ms. Spelling and Katya laugh] [background music] Ready? [Griffy chirping] [Griffy chirping] It's OK, Griffy, you can do this. Ready? [Griffy chirping] Wow, Griffy, look at you! You're getting so good at flying! [Griffy chirping] [Henri meows] Cleo, you're a really good teacher. Thanks, Katya. Helping Griffy is my favorite thing ever. [Henri meows] I think hunting for sparklies is Henri's favorite thing ever. [Katya and Cleo chuckling] And he really wants to win that prize. [Griffy chirps] You want to play to? OK. Let's go look for sparklies! [Frankie grunting] [Glorb squeaking] Sorry, Glorb. That's not a dragon sparkly. [Glorb squeaking] No, it's not a sparkly. I'm not sure what it is. May I take a look? [Glorb squeaking] [Lobo] I'll get it, fast, fast! [Lobo howling] Oh, sorry, Molasses. I'm not supposed to grab things out of people's hands, or paws. -[Molasses squeaking] -May I have that? Not going to grab. May I, may I, may I? Going to wait. [Ms. Spelling laughs] [Lobo sighs] Huh? Oh! [Lobo giggles] Thanks, buddy! -Oh, it's OK. -[Molasses gasps] I got you! Wow! Awesome! Wow! Lobo! He found his furever friend! [everyone cheering] Oh, goodness! What just happened? Lobo just made a monster match! What's a monster match? That's what happens when a monster finds a monster pet to be their furever friend. When a monster pet finds their one true monster, they create a magical bond. [Igor] They both get a lifetime of love. [Igor] And their monster gets special super-powers too. [Lobo howling] [Lobo howling] [Molasses laughing] [Lobo howling] Huh? Yay! [Lobo laughs] [Lobo gasps] Huh! Uh-huh! [Lobo gasps] Another sparkly! Wow, this is so awesome! Did you see that? Molasses and I slowed time! [Molasses yawns] Actually, mijito, you were running even faster than usual. No, really, everything slowed down. That's how I found three sparklies, see? [Igor] Maybe this will help. I filmed the whole thing. [camera click] [Lobo] See? That's when I saw the yellow sparkly, and there's me finding the red one! Wow, is that really how fast I was going? Because it felt so slow! Really, really slow. [Igor] Let me show it in slow motion. What? Wow! I thought that jump took forever! But even in slow motion, it's still like super fast! Making a monster match with a slow monster is so cool! -Amazing! -Super cool! Most of the furever friends in my family are kind of small. And fishy. My dad's monster match is an electric eel! He-he, Shocker is the best buddy a monster could ever wish for! Without him, I'd never be able to do this. [electrifying buzz] [everyone gasps] Now your twinkle lights are even prettier! Thanks for lighting them up. That sure is a super useful super-power. Happy to help. So your furever friend is an electric eel? He sure is. And Shocker helps you control your monster powers? He sure does. Hmm. But, where is he? Oh, Shocker's at home, in his fish tank. Once a monster makes a monster match, they can use their new powers anytime. Even if their pet isn't right there with them. When I get my furever friend, I hope I get a cool power upgrade, like my dad's. That would be exciting, wouldn't it, Frankie? Oh, maybe it'll happen tonight, just like Lobo and Molasses. Frankie, honey, you shouldn't get your hopes up. It's unusual for someone as young as Lobo to make a monster match. But... But Lobo just got his monster pet. And Katya and Henri were matched when she was smaller than Sammy. That's right, Sammy Lammy. Katya was younger than you when a tiny blue kitten hopped right into her playpen. And he's been helping her with her magic ever since. See? A monster match could happen anytime. Any time. You know, Frankie? I didn't find mine until I was a grown-up. [Momo squeaking] But now, I have Momo. And she was definitely worth waiting for. Your monster match is a mouse? I thought all witches had cats! Witches are just like other monsters. We can be paired with almost any kind of pet. That's what makes monster matches so wonderful. You never know how it will happen. You never know how your monster pet's magic will change your super-powers. And you never now when it can happen to you. Zoe is right. You never know when it could happen. So that means my monster match could happen at any time! Anytime! It could happen tonight! A monster match would be super fun! It would! But, other things are fun too. Like magic tricks. And flying lessons. [Griffy squeaking] And looking for dragon sparklies! And winning the treasure hunt! -I'm going to win! -We are going to win! We are going to win. No, I'm going to win. [everyone cheering] Hmm, maybe there's a sparkly over here. You're getting warm. Warmer. [Zoe laughs] This way? Warm, hot, hotter. -Huh? -Cold. Colder. [Spike] Really, really cold. -[Spike] Freezing! -Spike, look! [Zoe] There's a new pony on the carrousel. Cool! It's a unicorn. I don't think so. Unicorns are really pretty. With rainbow manes, and rainbow tails. That pony is all gray. Kind of ugly. [pony neighs] -Oh! -What? It's real! She's real. Hello. [Zoe neighs] Zoe. You speak unicorn? Uh-huh, everyone in my family speaks pony. But sometimes, we have trouble with the accents. [Zoe neighs] Hello, little unicorn. We didn't mean to upset you. -[unicorn neighs] -My name is Zoe. And this is Spike. Hello. What's your name? And what are you doing on the carrousel? [unicorn neighs] [Zoe neighs] -[unicorn neighs] -What did she say? She says her name is Luna. -Hi, Luna. -[Luna neighs] Luna says she was hiding here on the merry-go-round because she isn't pretty like the other unicorns. And she doesn't have their rainbow magic either. -[Luna neighs] -I'm sorry, Luna. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. [Luna neighs] Luna says she accepts your apology. [Luna neighs] Maybe Zoe could paint you rainbow colors. She's a really good painter. [Luna neighs] Well, I don't think paint would work. -Oh. -[Luna neighs] But I do have an idea that might help you feel better. To the art supplies! [Luna neighs] [Zoe giggles] I was telling Luna that she's welcome to stay and play. But someone needs to tell her family that she's OK. I'm sure they must be very worried. [Luna neighs] I can see that Zoe has something special planned for you. So why don't I let the other unicorns know you're safe? Daddy, do you know where Luna's family lives? I think so, it's the grove of pine trees. [neighs] -Right? -[Luna neighs] [neighs] Got it! [Zoe chuckles] OK, you two. Have fun. I'll be back in a little bit. -[Luna neighs] -[Zoe struggles] [Zoe laughs] You know? I think it's possible there might be another monster match tonight. Do you mean Cleo and Griffy? I do. Cleo's been helping Griffy with his flying lessons for weeks. She's so good with him. And he adores her. Cleo would love to have her very own monster pet. But, you know? Most mummies never make a monster match. Well, even if they aren't destined for a monster match, I know Cleo and Griffy will always have a very special friendship. -You found one! -[Griffy squeaks] -Great job, Griffy! -[Griffy squeaks] -You want to try going higher? -[Griffy squeaks] OK, here you go. [Griffy squeaking] There you go! You're doing great. You've got this! Look at him go! -[Griffy purrs] -[Drac] Come back here! [Drac gasps] [Griffy falls] Oh, no! [Cleo gasps] [Lobo pants] [Griffy struggles] [background music] It's OK, Griffy. I got you. Huh? [background music] Wow! [Lobo and Dr. Jekyll cheer] Alright! Woo-hoo! Huh? -[Cleo laughs] -[Griffy purrs] Wow! Huh? Awesome! Come on, Griffy, let's fly! A flying hat? Oh, great trick, Drac. It's not a magic trick, it's the Wingoats. [Count Dracula laughs] Those little Wingoats are hilarious. [Drac] Come back here! [Drac grunts] [Wing Goats bleat] I got you! [background music] Woo-hoo! [Wing Goats bleat] I made a monster match? [Count Dracula chuckles] Drac's mother is going to be so happy! Wingoats? I mean, I really like Bubble and Trouble. But I never thought my monster match would be a pair of Wingoats. I wonder if I can train them to do tricks. Like magic tricks? Yeah, maybe. Or, you know? Like a flying pig that you can train to fetch your slippers. Then I could just say: "Go home and fetch my boomerang." And, poof! Oh, my house! How did we get here? Huh? All I said was: "Go home and fetch my boomerang." And, I said where I wanted to go. And suddenly, we're here. My bat boomerang! There it is! Right where I left it. Oh, bats. [Drac sighs] Hey, come back here! [Wing Goats bleat] Huh? Even my monster match moves have moves! -[Wingoats bleating] -OK. Now that I've got both of you, and my boomerang, I just wish I'd knew how to get back to the park. Hi, Dad. I got my bat boomerang. I see that, but, how? I just wished I could go home, and, poof! [everyone gasps] [Drac] And poof, here I am! Drac's monster match power is teleportation? Teleport... What? Teleportation. It is a very rare power for a vampire. Especially one so young. Teleportation is really cool! Uh, what is it? Teleportation is the ability to go someplace as soon as you think of it. What? Like Drac could just wish he was at Luigi's, and be there? Or the amusement park? Or the library? That's the way it's supposed to work. But, he's going to need practice. [Drac laughs] Lots and lots of practice. Drac's got two furever friends. And I don't even have one. Wait! Maybe Drac could share with me! Then I could teleport too! Frankie, it doesn't really work that way. You never know, Dad! It could happen. -[Lobo panting] -[Cleo laughing] -[Frankie gasps] -Yeah! [Katya laughing] -[Henri purring] -Good job, Henri! That's six! We just need two more. [Frankie sighs] Everyone's monster matches are so amazing. They sure are. [Zoe giggles] Luna thinks so too. Luna! Your braids are beautiful! [Luna neighs] Luna said she never thought she'd ever have rainbow colors in her hair. She really likes them. I bet it would be super amazing to make a monster match with a unicorn. [Luna neighs] Luna says unicorns aren't monster pets, so they can't make monster matches. You never know. It could happen. [Luna neighs] Oh, thank you, Luna. What'd she say? She said it doesn't matter if she can't make a monster match, she's happy she made a monster friend. And I'm really happy to have made a unicorn friend too. -[Drac gasps] -[Frankie gasps] [Drac gasps] Oh, goodness! I know it's important for Cleo, Drac, and Lobo to practice their new super powers. Practice makes perfect. But maybe we could find a better, safer way for them to practice? Excellent point, Esme. And I think I know just the thing. Ready, Super Monsters? [Super Monsters] Ready! On your marks, get set. Go! [everyone cheering] [Count Dracula] Yes, yes! [Super Monsters laughing] [Cleo chuckling] Whoa, thanks, Griffy. I feel the need for speed! [background music] Slow motion is so cool! [Lobo speeding] [tense music] -[Cleo gasps] -[Griffy purrs] [Cleo and Griffy cheer] A sparkly! Great job, Griffy! Now we have six sparklies! You just need two more to win! [Drac] Boom! I want to take Bubble and Trouble to meet my mom! You can do it, Drac, just think about where you want to go. OK. What? My mom, not museum. OK, let's go back to the park! Huh? [Drac] Oh, not the amusement park. The other one! Oh, I just wanted to take the Wingoats to meet mom. But I can't figure out how to get back home. Your mother isn't home yet, she's still at the bank. She's working the graveyard shift. Graveyard shift? Huh? Oops. -[Henri purrs] -What is it, Henri? [Katya gasps] I see it, Henri! We only need one more! Way to go, Katya! Good job, Henri! [Henri meows] -[Katya gasps] -You're not part of the game! [Spike] Bring that back! [Frankie panting] You can't catch me! [Zoe laughs] Yes, I can! [Zoe gasps] [Zoe gasps] [Luna neighs] Feww! You got me! [Luna neighs] [Zoe] Wow! [Esme and Igor laugh] Luna! You're a moonicorn! [Luna neighs] Zoe! You made a monster match! With a moonicorn! -[Luna neighs] -[Zoe laughs] Woo-hoo! -[camera clicks] -[Luna neighs] [Zoey] Daddy! Enough pictures. Just one more. Luna, since you're a moonicorn, that means your magic comes from the moon. [Luna neighs] So, moonicorns can't use sunlight to make a rainbow path. [Luna neighs] But maybe you can use the moonlight to make a moonbow! [Luna neighs] [Zoe gasps] [Zoe] Wow! [Zoe laughs] Oh, bats. Making a monster match is awesome! I'm really happy for Lobo, and Cleo, and Drac, and Zoe. I know you are, Frankie. But, I'm kind of sad, too. It's OK, Frankie. No, it's not OK. It's not fair. Making a unicorn monster match was my idea. Maybe there's another moonicorn hiding on the carrousel. Then Zoe and I could race our ponies across the sky. I don't think that's-- I'm just going to go look. You never know. It could happen. [Super Monsters laughing] ♪ Everything's better With furever friends ♪ ♪ Betcha I can find mine too ♪ ♪ Yeah, everything's better With furever friends ♪ ♪ We can stop around together Monster and... ♪ ♪ Monster moonlight Shining so bright ♪ ♪ Show me what to do ♪ ♪ Oh, it's true There's a monster match for me ♪ ♪ And it could happen tonight ♪ ♪ You never know ♪ It could happen anytime, right, mom? Anytime. Anything is possible, Frankie. But it might be years before you make a monster match. And some monsters, like Cleo's mom and me, never make a Furever friend. But even without a monster match, you already have some amazing monster powers. You're the strongest monster in Pitchfork Pines Preschool. And you have the best monster stomp in town. My super stomp is super awesome. [Frankie stomps] Oh, Frankie! [Esme and Igor laugh] [Frankie laughs] Frankie, would you like to use some of that super strength and help me carry some things back to the preschool? I don't really feel like helping. I understand. You stay here with the others, and I'll be back in a minute. I just need to drop off a few things, and feed Goldie. Goldie? Maybe Goldie is my monster match! She could live in our fish tank with Shocker! Hi, Goldie! I'm sorry to disappoint you, Frankie. Goldie is just an ordinary goldfish. She's a very delightful little goldfish. But, she's not a magical monster pet. [Frankie] Oh, bats. [Frankie] Oh. Fluffy! Oh, Fluffy! Can we help you, Mr. Gadmore? Oh, thank you, Frankie. Fluffy slipped her leash, and she's hiding. Fluffy loves to play hide-and-seek. But, I'm getting a little worried. We'll help you find her. Won't we? -Uh-huh. -Of course, Frankie. Here, Fluffy, Fluffy, Fluffy. There she is! I found her! And I found some dragon sparklies too. [Mr. Gadmore] Oh, there you are, my little Fluffy wuffy! [Fluffy squeaks] That's OK, Fluffy. Not every pet can be a monster pet. And, besides, you belong with Mr. Gadmore. He loves you just the way you are. I could help the grown-ups. Or, I could go play with my friends. [Super Monsters laughing] I guess I'll help clean up. Cool! [Zoe laughing] There's one! [Zoe] Oh! I didn't know I could do that. I've never been able to take anyone with me when I use my zombie powers. I bet that's your power-up from your monster match! -Want to try it? -Hmm, I don't think so. Come on, Frankie. It'll be fun. [Zoe chuckling] [Frankie laughing] That tickled! [Frankie laughing] Hey, I found another sparkly! [Frankie laughing] One more, and I win! Oh, I'm going to keep looking! OK, Frankie, good luck! [Katya] One more, and we win. [Katya] Yee-haw! [Katya giggling] We found it! Wee! [Frankie sighs] Bats. [Spike] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! -You win! -[everyone cheering] -[Cleo] Congratulations! -[Katya] Woo! Good job, Katya. Thank you for a really fun game, Spike. You and your mom made it the best treasure hunt ever. Congratulations! It's beautiful! Thank you! -Henri! -[Henri purrs] Looks like Henri really wants that dragon jewel. He sure does. OK, Henri, ready to put this on your collar? -[Henri meows] -Just hold still, one more second and, OK, I got you. [background music] [all] Wow! [Frankie] Oh! [Katya] Wow! [Katya giggles] Wow! [everyone gasps] [Igor] Oh! [Igor laughs] Oopsie! That's a lot of big magic for a little witch. Thank goodness Katya has great teachers and friends at preschool to help her learn to use it. It's not fair! Katya already had Henri, and now she gets more magic too? This is the worst First Night ever. How come everybody got a monster match except for me? You know? Spike didn't get a monster match either. You're right! I should go find him. We can be miserable together. [Frankie grunting] There he is! [Spike grunting] Hey! Come back here! Oh? Ha! You got me! -[bird chirping] -[Spike laughing] [Spike] Tag! I got you! [Spike gasps] Wow! [all] Wow! -[Spike's mom laughs] -[Spike laughs] Mom! I got a monster match! It's Phoebe! Isn't she wonderful? Hello, Phoebe! Mom, look at my wings! Spike, your wings are amazing! [Frankie] They're so big! They are big! Really, really big! And big dragon wings means that now my flap-hop glide... is my flap-hop fly! I can fly! But, be careful! Remember to look both ways! Don't go too far! Don't worry, Mom. I've got this. Your father is going to be so happy! And your sister and brother are going to be a bit jealous. [Spike laughing] They look so happy. They sure do. Spike's dragon wings are amazing! They sure are. -[Griffy squeaking] -[Cleo] Woo-hoo! Way to go, Cleo! You got this! Hmm, dad? I'm really happy that Spike and Cleo have Phoebe and Griffy as their forever friends. I know you are. And I'm happy that Lobo, Drac and Zoe made monster matches too. U-huh. And I love Henri, he's the best. [Henri meows] [Katya laughs] And Katya's new powers are so cool. I'm really happy for my friends. So, how come I feel so bad? You know, Frankie? You could be happy for your friends and still be sad too. You can? You sure can. And it's OK to feel sad. It doesn't make you a bad friend. As long as you don't try to make your friends feel bad because they have something you don't. I don't want to make them feel bad. I want them to enjoy tonight, so they can remember it forever. But I don't want to pretend that I'm not feeling sad. Because... I am. I'm going to help clean up. [wand swishing] Oh, I was going to help clean up. Dr. Jekyll has a lot of picnic things to carry back to the petting zoo. I'm sure she could use a super-strong, super-helpful, Super Monster to help her. On it! Dr. Jekyll. You must feel really sad. What makes you say that? Well, all of your monster pets are matched. So now, they'll go live with their one true monster, and you'll be all alone. Right? Oh, Frankie, that is so kind of you to be worried about how I feel. I will miss Griffy, Molasses, and Phoebe. And the Wingoats. Especially the Wingoats. They are so silly, and so sweet. But, I know they'll still come to visit me. They can play at the petting zoo while their Super Monsters are in school. But it will never be the same as it was. Doesn't that make you sad? Not at all. In fact, I'm actually really, really happy. Even though your friends have new friends? And... and you don't? Frankie, it's my job to help monster pets to find their furever homes. And tonight was the best night I've had in a long time. I'm just sorry that Jerry the Jackelope had to miss it. [Frankie] Oh, how come Jerry couldn't go to the picnic? [Jerry groans] Jerry! How'd he get so big? Is he OK? Frankie, do you know the story of Pinocchio? The puppet boy, who's nose grows bigger every time he lies. Exactly! Jerry is a lot like Pinocchio. But it's not just his nose that grows. Jerry's whole body gets bigger whenever he tells a fib. Really? I didn't know Jerry could talk. I've only heard him chirp. What does he say? Oh, Jerry doesn't speak human. But I speak monster pet. Like Zoe speaks pony? Exactly! So I always know what the animals in the petting zoo are saying. And, unfortunately, Jerry can't resist telling tall tales. And the bigger his stories get, the bigger he grows. Hey, Jerry. I'm sorry you missed the picnic. The monster animals and I really missed you tonight. -I'm sure you missed us too. -[Jerry grunts] Really? Not even a little bit? [Jerry grunts] We have to help him! I wish we could. But the only way that Jerry could shrink back to normal is for him to tell the truth. The truth about what? This morning, Jerry was playing with my stethoscope, -and broke it. -But everybody breaks things. I break things all the time. All the time. You're right, Frankie. Everybody makes mistakes. And if Jerry had just told me what happened, it wouldn't have been a problem. [Jerry grunts] But instead, he lied about it, and blamed it on Phoebe. Poor Jerry. He must've felt bad about breaking your ste... Your ste... -What's it called? -A stethoscope. It's what doctors and veterinarians use to listen to a patient's heart and lungs. Wow, that sounds so cool. I'd want to play with it too. But Jerry should've asked you for permission first. Yes, he should have. And when he broke it, he should've told you the truth. I wish he had. But instead, Jerry just kept lying until he got so big, he couldn't leave the petting zoo. [Jerry grunts] Maybe I could talk to him. I think that's an excellent idea. You know, Jerry? I break things and make mistakes all the time. All the time. -[Jerry grunts] -It feels bad to make a mistake. [Jerry grunts] But it feels really, really bad if you lie about it. [Jerry grunts] Wow, what'd he say? Jerry says that he was the one who broke my stethoscope. Not Phoebe. [Jerry grunts] Thank you, Jerry. I accept your apology. [Jerry grunts] [Frankie laughs] Goodness, I've never heard Jerry apologize so sincerely, or seen him shrink so quickly! -[Jerry grunts] -I got you! [background music] [Super Monsters gasp] [Jerry grunts] [Lobo] Oh, that's great, buddy! [Frankie stomps] Woo-hoo! You made a monster match! [Frankie's mom] A jackelope! Jerry is the sweetest, funniest, bounciest furever friend ever. [Jerry grunts] You got a power-up too. Oh, I don't think so. Oh, Frankie, you definitely got a power-up. A really big power-up! I did? What did I get? [everyone chuckling] Wow! You guys got really small. What happened? [Katya chuckling] We're not small. You're just big. Super big. I'm big! Igor, Esme! I'm big! I'm mega-sized! But how do I shrink back to Frankie size? Mega-size! Frankie-size. Mega-size! Frankie-size! [all] Wow! -I love my new power. -[all] Yay! Whoa, yeah!
