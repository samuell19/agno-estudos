OOH, I'M ONE OF THE GANG NOW, AND THEY HAVE A HIDEOUT IN A LOT OF MOTORCAR BODIES, AND THEN LATER, GIG TOOK BUCK AND ME TO SEE HIS AUNT ROSE UP ON PARK AVENUE. WHAT, GIG HAS AN AUNT LIVING ON PARK AVENUE? IN A VERY PRETTY FLAT. AND SHE'S VERY PRETTY HERSELF. AND SHE WEARS PAJAMAS, AND SHE TURNED CARTWHEELS ALL OVER THE DRAWING ROOM. REALLY, NOW?

NO, NO, NO. ABOUT $20, I IMAGINE. WELL, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. YOU SEE, DAD, I WAS THINKING THAT INSTEAD OF BUYING A BICYCLE -- LISTEN, NOW, SON, I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT OFF THAT BICYCLE FOR A WHILE. YOU SEE, THOSE PLANS COME BACK FOR CHANGES, AND WE DON'T GET PAID TILL THEY'RE ACCEPTED, AND, WELL, WE HAVEN'T VERY MANY $20 KNOCKING ABOUT JUST NOW. Y-YOU MEAN WE'RE RATHER HARD UP? I'M AFRAID SO.

[ DOOR SLAMS ] CLAUDE: Shh! You'll have the whole of Scotland Yard upon us. BUCK: How do you know whose yard it is? I thought you said nobody was at home. Shh. Tiptoe. What are we going upstairs here for? People always keep their valuables upstairs. Why? Well, uh, because. Oh. Now, we'll try this room in here first. Now, the play rooms are usually about here. Gee, are you cold, too, Buck? Yeah. Just as I thought. Gee! Look at that swell sled! And there's a pair of skates, ain't they? I'd like to be able to jump on those. Where would you jump from?

WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. GO AHEAD AND SEE ABOUT IT. SO, THIS IS WHAT I GET. HERE I FOUGHT AND BLED TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY, A DECENT PLACE TO LIVE IN, AND NOW MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD TURNS INTO A NO-GOOD, FRESH RAT, A THIEF! AND YOU WON'T TALK, EH? WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, MR. WON'T TALK. ARE YOU GONNA TALK? ARE YOU GONNA TALK? ARE YOU GONNA TALK? [ SMACKING ] HOW'S THAT TO HELP OPEN YOUR MOUTH?! JIM MURPHY! JIM MURPHY!

WELL, I'LL POSSIBLY FIND OUT TOMORROW, YOU KNOW. BUT -- BUT, DAD, YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BE A SQUEALER, WOULD YOU? LISTEN, A FELLA'S ONLY A SQUEALER WHEN HE PUTS THE BLAME ON SOMEONE ELSE TO SAVE HIS OWN FACE, YOU KNOW. BUT -- BUT DON'T YOU SEE, DAD... I-I'M ONE OF THE GANG NOW. I DON'T WISH TO WORRY YOU. TRULY I DON'T, DAD. BUT, YOU SEE, WE HAVE A CODE, AND -- WELL, WHAT ABOUT OUR CODE? ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER? DAD, I -- TRULY, YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT'S ALL. CLAUDE. COME HERE. SIR? COME HERE. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I WANT TO KNOW. EXAMINE YOURSELF INSIDE. IN YOUR HEART, HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING DISHONORABLE, ANYTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF? NO, SIR. RIGHT. THEN WHATEVER IT IS, WE'LL SEE IT THROUGH, HUH? OH, I'M CLAUDE PIERCE. SIT DOWN. HI, BUCK. DAD, THIS IS BUCK. I'M CLAUDE'S FATHER. OH. CHARMED TO SHAKE YOUR HAND, I'M SURE. HOW DO. ENGLISH, EH? THAT'S IT. I WAS OVER THERE IN '17. PROUD LITTLE COUNTRY, AIN'T IT? YES. WE WERE AT THE TIME, I IMAGINE. I WAS WITH THE 77th, NEW YORK. WHAT OUTFIT WAS YOU IN? SUSSEX... SUSSEX... [ CHUCKLES ] NUTTY NAMES YOU GUYS HAD. I GUESS YOU WERE KIND OF GLAD TO SEE US COME OVER THERE AT THAT, EH? YEAH. WE WERE VERY GRATEFUL. GRATEFUL? WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT. WELL, IT'S THE BEST I CAN THINK OF. YOU SEE, YOU'RE THE FIRST AMERICAN I'VE MET SO FAR THAT'S ASKED ME THAT QUESTION. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT NICE MEETING YOU THIS WAY, MR. PIERCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO KIDS THESE DAYS. HEAVEN KNOWS WE'VE WORKED OUR FINGERS TO THE BONE TO GIVE BUCK THE BEST OF EVERYTHING. Mr. Murphy: THAT STEVENS BRAT'S FAULT, 10 TO 1. OLD RED WAS A GOOD SOLDIER, OKAY, BUT THERE'S A STREAK THERE. THERE'S BAD BLOOD THERE, MR. PIERCE. WHY, IF I -- HERE'S GIG. Buck: LOOK WHO'S WITH HIM. DAD, THIS IS MISS HAWLEY, GIG'S AUNT ROSE. HOW DO YOU DO? OH, YES. HELLO. YOU'RE THE LADY WHO TURNS CARTWHEELS, HUH? I'M AFRAID I AM. AS WELL AS YOU CAN CATCH A FOOTBALL? THANKS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT ALL OF THIS IS ABOUT? NO, I DON'T. GIG'S GONE FOOLISH STUBBORN ON ME. HAS YOUR STAR HALFBACK DONE THE SAME? YES. THESE FELLAS, THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE -- [ GAVEL BANGS ] JOSEPH WILSON, I USUALLY PRONOUNCE SENTENCE IN CHAMBERS, BUT YOUR CASE IS SO FLAGRANTLY FULL OF MISDEMEANORS, BROKEN PROMISES, OPEN DEFIANCE TO THE LAW... THAT I FEEL THE WHOLE COURT SHOULD LISTEN SO THAT YOUR CONTEMPORARIES -- THAT IS THE YOUNG MEN IN THIS COURTROOM WHO MIGHT BE TEMPTED INTO FOLLOWING YOUR VICIOUS EXAMPLE -- SHALL HEAR WHAT ACTION YOU HAVE FORCED THE STATE TO TAKE. FOR TWO YEARS, YOU'VE LIED TO THE PROBATION OFFICERS WHO TRIED TO HELP YOU. YOU'VE LIED TO ME. BUT WHAT'S WORSE, YOU'VE LIED TO YOUR MOTHER -- STOLEN AND LIED AND SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HER VERY MISERABLE. THEREFORE, IT'S MY UNPLEASANT DUTY TO SENTENCE YOU ON THIS DATE TO FOUR YEARS IN THE STATE REFORMATORY. OH, NO! OH, NO, JUDGE! OH, JOE, MY BABY! COME ON, SON. COME ON. [ Crying ] MY BABY! I'LL COME SEE YOU, DARLING! I'LL PRAY FOR YOU! OH, JOEY, BE A GOOD BOY, WON'T YOU? JOEY, BE A GOOD BOY, WON'T YOU? NEXT CASE IN CHAMBERS. YES, SIR. ROBERT MURPHY, JAMES STEVENS JR., CLAUDE PIERCE, AND THEIR PARENTS, WITNESSES AND OFFICERS IN THE CASE -- STEP THIS WAY, PLEASE. RIGHT IN HERE, FOLKS. I HOPE THEY SEND US ALL TO THE SAME PLACE. AS I SEE, YOUR HONOR, YOU COULD HAVE KNOCKED ME OVER WHEN OFFICER MULDOON QUESTIONED ME ABOUT THE TOYS. I-I THINK I WAS OVER-GENEROUS ON THE DEAL, YOUR HONOR. THEY COULDN'T HAVE GOT THAT PRICE FROM ANY OTHER ESTABLISHMENT. THAT'S ALL, MR. MULSON. OH. CAN I GO NOW? NO. BE SEATED, PLEASE. NOW, ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT, NONE OF YOU BOYS WILL HELP US OR YOURSELVES BY SAYING A WORD IN THIS MATTER. IS THAT RIGHT, ROBERT? THAT'S RIGHT. ROBERT, LOOK AT ME WHEN YOU'RE TALKING. YES, SIR. THAT'S RIGHT. JAMES, CAN'T YOU HELP US? Gig: NO. "SIR." SIR. CLAUDE, WHAT ABOUT YOU? WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING? NO, SIR, YOUR HONOR. NOW, I SEE THAT NONE OF THE PARENTS RECOGNIZE THESE TOYS OR THAT SPENDING MONEY WAS EVER GIVEN IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO ALLOW FOR SUCH PURCHASES. IS THAT CORRECT, MR. MURPHY? IT IS! I WOULDN'T SPOIL MY SON WITH SUCH TRUCK, YOUR HONOR. AND IF YOU LET ME HAVE THOSE KIDS FOR THREE MINUTES, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO GET THIS THING OUT OF THEM. A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED SHELLACKING HAS ALWAYS PUT THAT ONE IN HIS PLACE. THERE'S NO REASON WHY THE OTHERS SHOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME. NOW, JUST A MOMENT, MR. MURPHY. JUDGE, I KNOW WHAT MEN ARE MADE OF. I WENT OVER THE TOP A DOZEN TIMES IN THE LAST BIG SHOW. I HAD AN UNCLE WHO FOUGHT IN CUBA, AND MY WIFE'S GRANDFATHER SHOWED THE INDIANS A THING OR TWO OUT IN -- UH, WHAT WAS THAT PLACE THAT THEY -- MR. MURPHY, YOUR BOY IS NEITHER A GERMAN, A SPANIARD, NOR AN INDIAN. JUDGE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND -- NOW SIT DOWN, PLEASE. [ GRUMBLES ] NOW, MR. MURPHY, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE NO ACTUAL COMPLAINT AGAINST THESE BOYS. WE ONLY SUSPECT FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PARENTS ARE GUILTY OF IMPROPER SUPERVISION, AND, IN YOUR CASE, IT BEGINS TO APPEAR WE'RE CORRECT. MR. PIERCE... YOUR AFFIDAVIT CONCERNING THESE TOYS IS THE SAME? YES, YOUR HONOR. MRS. STEVENS, YOU SAY YOU -- WELL, YOUR HONOR, I -- IF IT PLEASES THE COURT, THIS LADY IS NOT MRS. STEVENS. NO, I'M ROSE HAWLEY, HIS AUNT, HIS MOTHER'S SISTER. SHE COULDN'T BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON, SO SHE -- WELL, SHE CALLED ME UP AND ASKED FOR ME TO COME HERE AND TAKE HER PLACE. YOU SEE, SHE WORKS FROM 4:00 UNTIL 11:00 AT THE UNIVERSAL OUTFITTERS ON 14th STREET. I SEE. WHAT ABOUT JAMES' FATHER? COULDN'T HE HAVE -- Man: OH, YOUR HONOR. OH, YES. I REMEMBER NOW. I'M SORRY, JAMES. MISS HAWLEY, YOU REALIZE THAT WHEN A BOY CANNOT BE GIVEN ADEQUATE SUPERVISION AT HOME, HE'S USUALLY BETTER OFF IN THE CARE OF -- NO ONE CAN SAY ANYTHING AGAINST GIG'S MOTHER, YOUR HONOR. SHE, WELL -- WELL, SHE STEPPED IN-INTO QUITE A RAW DEAL, AND I KNOW SHE LOVES HIM, AND SHE'S -- SHE'S TRIED TO TEACH HIM A-AND PROTECT HIM FROM -- WELL, FROM THINGS AROUND HIM. I-I DON'T WANT HER TO WORK, YOUR HONOR. WELL, I'VE TRIED TO GIVE HER MONEY, BUT SHE JUST WON'T TAKE IT. WHY IS THAT? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I-I GUESS SHE'S PROUD. YES, THAT'S IT, YOUR HONOR. IT'S HER PRIDE. AS LONG AS YOU'RE A WOMAN OF SOME MEANS, WOULD YOU BE IN THE POSITION TO HAVE GIG WITH YOU, THAT IS UNTIL HIS MOTHER CAN OBTAIN A POSITION THAT WON'T CONFLICT WITH HER PROPER GUARDIANSHIP? WELL, I... I COULD ARRANGE IT, YOUR HONOR. WHERE DO YOU LIVE? 645 PARK AVENUE. WILL YOUR HUSBAND CONSENT TO THIS? I'M NOT MARRIED, YOUR HONOR. I SEE. YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT INCOME. YES, I HAVE. AND WHAT SORT OF INCOME, MISS HAWLEY? WELL, YOUR HONOR -- YOUR HONOR, I SHOULD LIKE TO VOUCH FOR MISS HAWLEY'S PROPER GUARDIANSHIP. I'VE KNOWN MISS HAWLEY FOR SOME TIME, QUITE A LONG TIME, IN FACT, AND IF SHE ARRANGES TO TAKE GIG, YOU CAN BE SURE HE'LL NOT HAVE A BETTER HOME OR WISER SUPERVISION ANYWHERE. THANK YOU, MR. PIERCE. YOU MAY BE SEATED, MISS HAWLEY. GIG, WILL YOU COME UP HERE? AND, ROBERT, YOU TOO, PLEASE. WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU -- "BOB"? NO. "SIR." NO, SIR. THEY CALL ME "BUCK." THEY CALL ME "LIMEY," SIR. NOW, YOU KEEP YOUR SEAT, CLAUDE. I WANT TO TALK TO BUCK AND GIG FOR A MOMENT. YES, SIR. BUCK, EH? OOH, THAT'S A SWELL NAME. THEY USED TO CALL ME "STINKY." YOU KNOW WHY? I GUESS SO. WELL, THAT CERTAINLY LEVELED MY CHIN THAT TIME. NO, BUCK. I ONCE TRIED SOME OF MY DAD'S BAY RUM ON MY HAIR, AND, WELL, I WAS APT ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT WAY. MM. NOW, SEE HERE, FELLAS, I'VE GOT A HUNCH ABOUT YOU TWO. MY HUNCH IS THAT YOU AND GIG KNOW THE REAL STORY BEHIND THESE TOYS AND THAT CLAUDE JUST FOUND HIMSELF TAGGING ALONG. Holmes: ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GIG? YOU SAID IT WAS YOUR HUNCH, SIR. NOW, LOOK, FELLAS, THE BEST FUN I GET IS MAKING FRIENDS WITH THE BOYS WHO COME HERE TO TALK WITH ME, AND I MEAN FRIENDSHIPS THAT LAST, BUT SOMETIMES FRIENDSHIPS GO THROUGH A LOT OF TROUBLE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? Claude: OH, YES, SIR. THEY ALWAYS COME OUT ALL RIGHT IF YOU PERSIST, SIR. NOW, CLAUDE, YOU MUSTN'T SPEAK UNTIL I ASK YOU TO. YES, SIR. NOW, SINCE YOU BOTH REFUSE TO TELL THE SIMPLE TRUTH, I COULDN'T VERY WELL PUT YOU ON PROBATION, COULD I? BECAUSE PROBATION DEPENDS UPON YOUR WORD OF HONOR. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO US? WELL, YOU WERE OUT THERE AND HEARD WHERE I HAD TO SEND JOE WILSON? YES. WELL, NOW, IF YOU KEEP REFUSING TO TELL THE TRUTH, IT'LL ONLY PROVE TO ME THAT YOU'RE STARTING ON THE ROAD TO THE SAME PLACE. OH, I KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE A MERRY OLD ROAD WHILE YOU'RE ON IT. YOU OUTSMART A LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU'RE BIG SHOTS AND HAVE A LOT OF FUN. YOU WON'T SQUEAL ON OTHERS. BUT THEN, SUDDENLY, YOU LAND INSIDE, AND THEN ALL THE FUN'S GONE, DO YOU KNOW THAT? I AIN'T BEEN THERE YET. NO GETTING OUT TO PLAY AFTER SCHOOL, BECAUSE IT'S SCHOOL ALL THE TIME UP THERE. NO GOING HOME TO SEE YOUR FOLKS, SEEING YOUR MOTHER. GIG, YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER, DON'T YOU? OF COURSE I DO. WHAT GUY DON'T LOVE HIS OWN MOM? WELL, THEN, ISN'T IT BEST TO TALK THIS OVER? I GOT NOTHING TO SAY, I TELL YOU! ME NEITHER. I'M SORRY FOR THAT ATTITUDE. YOU'RE TRYING TO LEAVE ME ONLY ONE ALTERNATIVE. NOW, IF YOU WON'T TELL THE TRUTH, I'LL HAVE TO -- IF YOU PLEASE, SIR, YOUR HONOR, DON'T, BECAUSE, YOU SEE, I DIDN'T TAG ALONG. I PLANNED THE WHOLE ROBBERY, SIR. ROBBERY, CLAUDE? YES, SIR. YOU SEE, GIG NEEDED $80, AND, WELL, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT FOR US TO STEAL TIRES WHEN I KNEW A PERFECTLY GOOD HOUSE WE COULD ROB ALL AT ONCE. WHAT HOUSE DID YOU ROB? WHY, MY OWN HOUSE, SIR. YOUR OWN HOUSE? YES, SIR. WELL, MY MOTHER'S -- 26 EAST 68th STREET, SIR. SHE'S AWAY IN FLORIDA, BUT SHE LEFT US THE KEYS. AND, WELL, THOSE ARE MY OWN TOYS, SIR. I-I HAVEN'T TOLD GIG AND BUCK UNTIL NOW, SIR. AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD THEM? WELL, THERE WAS THE $80 NEEDED, AND I SUPPOSE I JUST WANTED TO BE RAFFLES, THAT'S ALL. RAFFLES, HMM? I SEE. YES, SIR, BUT RAFFLES IN A RIGHT WAY. MR. PIERCE, THIS IS ALL QUITE POSSIBLE, I TAKE IT? OH, MOST PROBABLY, YOUR HONOR. IF YOU WISH, I CAN CALL THE CARETAKER, AND HE CAN SHOW THE HOUSE INVENTORY. BUT, DAD, THIS IS THE TRUTH. YOUR HONOR, YOU DO BELIEVE? THE COURT TAKES YOUR WORD COMPLETELY, CLAUDE. THEN MAY WE GO NOW, SIR? NO. JUST WAIT A MOMENT NOW. GIG, DO YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT YOU DID WITH THE $80? WELL, YOU DON'T MIND NOW, DO YOU? I DON'T MIND TELLING ANYBODY. I DON'T CARE HOW I WAS FOOLED INTO GETTING IT, EITHER. I BOUGHT A TOMBSTONE WITH IT FOR MY OLD MAN. AND YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM 'CAUSE IT'S BOUGHT AND PAID FOR. WELL, YOUR HONOR, NOW THAT THE BARRAGE HAS LIFTED AND WE'VE GAINED OUR LITTLE OBJECTIVE, I RECKON YOU WON'T BE NEEDING US ANYMORE. SIT DOWN, MR. MURPHY. GIG, BUCK... NOW, BOTH OF YOU FELLAS KNEW YOU WERE STEALING SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO YOU OR CLAUDE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? YES, SIR. WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE THE TRUTH IN YOU. BUT JUST TO REMIND YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS, I'M GOING TO PUT YOU BOTH ON PROBATION FOR SIX MONTHS, AND I WANT THAT TO MEAN SIMPLY THIS AND ONLY THIS -- YOU'RE TO COME TO THE PROBATION OFFICER ONCE A MONTH AND SAY TO HIM, "I'M DOING GREAT, AND I'M NEVER GOING TO GET INTO TROUBLE AGAIN." IS THAT UNDERSTOOD? YES, SIR. GOOD. CASE DISMISSED. NOW I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THESE THREE BOYS ALONE, PLEASE. SIT DOWN, FELLAS. YOU FELLAS PLAY FOOTBALL, DON'T YOU? YEAH. SURE. WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE THE QUARTERBACK'S SIGNALS, DO YOU WALK OUT ON HIM? THE POINT IS, FELLAS, THAT TIMES WHEN PARENTS DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND, JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL, NOW, THAT'S THE TIME I WANT YOU FELLAS TO SHOW ME HOW TOUGH YOU ARE. HOW? BY PULLING THE SWITCH ON THEM AND DOING EXACTLY AS THEY SAY. THAT'S HOW. NOW, THAT'S WHAT MAKES A FELLA TOUGH, BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT. WHY, YOU WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO CALL YOU "LITTLE DEVIL," WOULD YOU? THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT BAD LITTLE SISSIES WHO ACT NAUGHTY WHEN THEY CAN'T HAVE THEIR OWN WAY. BY THE WAY, THE DEVIL IS A WEAK SISSY. YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU? THE DEVIL? SURE, BECAUSE HE WAS AN ANGEL ONCE. AN ANGEL? YEAH, AND AN ANGEL HAS TO BE TOUGH IN ORDER TO DO HIS JOB, AND THE DEVIL COULDN'T BE TOUGH ENOUGH, SO THEY THREW HIM OUT, AND HE'S BEEN HIDING DOWN BELOW EVER SINCE. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE DEVIL'S A SISSY. WELL, GOODBYE, GIG. GOODBYE, SIR. BUCK. YES, SIR. GOODBYE, CLAUDE. GOODBYE, SIR. NOW, MY FRIENDS, THINK IT OVER, WILL YOU? WHAT A PECULIAR, NICE GENTLEMAN FOR A JUDGE. HAPPEN WE MEET, NEXT TIME YOU'LL REALLY GET YOUR EARS KNOCKED DOWN. HUH? RAFFLES, HUH? WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE A SAP OUT OF? NOW, LISTEN. GET THIS INTO YOUR DOME, DOPE. FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE OUT OF THE GANG. SEE, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE DEAD. YOU CAN PLAY A NICE, LONG GAME OF HOT HANDS ALL BY YOURSELF. COME ON. HIYA, BUCK. HI, BUCK. WHAT'S THE MATTER? OH, I WAS WASHING THE DISHES, AND I DROPPED THE SOUP THING AND WOKE UP MY OLD MAN. MY OLD MAN SLAPS IN ANY PLACE EXCEPT ON THE EAR. HE SAYS IT MAKES YOU DEAF. HE CAN'T MAKE ME DEAF. HE'S STILL BURNT UP ABOUT THE TOYS, HUH? OH, HE'S STEAMING 'CAUSE THE JUDGE CRAWLED UP HIS BACK. TOMORROW'S SATURDAY, AIN'T IT? SURE. TOMORROW'S SATURDAY, AIN'T IT, GIG? I GUESS SO. I MEAN, IT'S THE FIRST SATURDAY BUCK AND YOU HAVE GOT TO REPORT TO THE PROBATION OFFICER, AIN'T IT? MAYBE IT IS, AND MAYBE IT AIN'T. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT AIN'T? YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA REPORT, DO YOU? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE. Bugs: WHERE YOU GONNA GO? OUT WEST FIRST TO SEE THE SKELETONS IN DEATH VALLEY. AFRICA, MAYBE. Six-Toes: WHEN ARE YOU GOING? NO, SIR -- NO GUY NAMED PAUL KRUMPP IS GONNA HANG AROUND MY HOUSE AND CALL ME HIS BOY. Bugs: WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GO? TONIGHT. TONIGHT! THAT'S WHEN. TONIGHT AFTER SUPPER. YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GOING -- TONIGHT. TONIGHT, AFTER SUPPER. I'M TELLING YOU, AIN'T I? SURE. SAY, I-I WANT TO STOP BY THE CEMETERY FIRST AND SEE IT. IT'S THERE NOW, AND I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET. YEAH, YEAH, SURE. WE'LL STOP ON THE WAY. TO GO TO AFRICA, YOU GOT TO HAVE GUNS. YOU GOT TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE FUNNY-LOOKING HATS WITH A TOWEL HANGING DOWN THE BACK. WE'LL GET GUNS! WE'LL GET ONE OF THOSE HATS IF WE NEED THEM, TOO. Claude: HELLO, FELLOWS. I STOPPED BY AFTER SCHOOL AND GOT THIS CRACKERJACK. OH, UH, WANT SOME? NO! GIG? NAH. SIX-TOES? YEAH. AND IT HAD THIS WHISTLE IN IT AS THE PRIZE. SEE? [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] EVER SEE A HEEL TALKING TO ITSELF? YEAH. HAPPEN WE COME BACK IN 50 YEARS, HE MIGHT BE GONE. COME ON. [ SNEEZES ] WHAT DID THEY MEAN BY THAT? THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY, TO AFRICA, MAYBE.
