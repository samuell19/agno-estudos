[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Male narrator: In Europe, as the 17th century dawned mankind was lifting itself from ignorance and superstition. The old frontiers of the mind were rolling back. New books, new methods were aiding man in his climb toward knowledge and wisdom. In the laboratory... in the arts, in every field of endeavor man was lifting himself hand over hand climbing onward, ever upward. And on the outskirts of London on a summer night another man was lifting himself hand over hand climbing upward, ever onward... toward his objective. - Catherine? - Don Juan. Oh, why have you kept me waiting? I thought you'd never come. See how my heart is pounding? Beloved, no power on Earth would have kept me from you. In all this world, there's been but one image in my heart. - One vision before my eyes. - Yes, yes, go on. I have loved you since the beginning of time. But you only met me yesterday. Why, that was when time began. Don Juan. My incomparable Don Juan. Yes, yours and yours only. I wish I could believe you. But you've made love to so many women. Catherine... an artist may paint a thousand canvases before achieving one work of art. Would you deny a lover the same practice? But how long will you love me? Sweet lady, love is not measured in terms of time only in ecstasy. It's a beautiful night. How bright the moon is shining. Is there a moon? It will be eclipsed when my husband returns. Love like ours will never be eclipsed. Your husband? You said you were unmarried. I said I was unattached. And since I'm not attached to my husband, I told you the truth. Oh. But let's not speak of husbands. It's such a tedious subject. Yes, of course. And there's really no need to worry. He's on a hunting trip. He's extremely fond of grouse. Grouse, eh? And besides... we have only these few moments. A few moments? How few, loved one? What is time? A week, a day, an hour, a minute? Time flies. And he always blows his trumpet when he returns. Catherine, look, got a grouse. Got a... Who is this? You tell him. Cecil, you didn't blow your trumpet. Out of my way, mistress. Speak up, you. Sir, I realize that this must appear to be a trifle compromising. Com-- compromising? En garde, sir. If you would allow me to explain-- I will allow you a decent burial and no more. Will you draw your sword, sir, or shall I run you through? That's not a very attractive offer. However, you leave me no choice. - Now what shall I do? - Whatever you think best. Don Juan: But can't you talk to him? Touche. [swords clanking] Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I? Ashamed? Do you think it's fair to leave a beautiful young woman like this alone, neglected while you indulge your own selfish pleasures? How true. Grouse hunting? When did you last tell her she's beautiful? I don't have to tell her, she's my wife. Wrong. You should remind her of her beauty every day of her life. Write her poetry, send her flowers. - And jewelry. - Be quiet. We should never close our eyes to beauty. If you'd open yours, you'd have not only a wife but a wife's love. Sir... I give you back... [clears throat] Your grouse. Catherine: Be careful. Thank you, my lady, but this has become more or less of a habit. Cecil: Guards! Guards! Quickly! Guards! - Leporello, quick. Cecil: Guards! - What now? - Husband. Horses. Cecil: After that man. There! Over the wall! Hurry! Hurry! Bring the scoundrel back dead or alive. And now, mistress, I'll deal with you. ?Tiff? Ugh, first, I must tend to my grouse. [dramatic music] - Halt! - By whose command, fellow? By command of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth. This road is to be kept clear. - For what reason? - To escort the Spanish Duke. His Grace the Duke of Cordoba, along this road to London. [dramatic music] What next, you big but? How many times must I tell you how much I dislike and hate pomp and ceremony? - How many times? - Yes. - He doesn't like them. - Your pardon, sir. Are you-- Merely a simple traveler, captain. No matter. We'll find another road. - Thank you. - If you wish, Your Grace... - I mean... I mean, sir. - What's that? Oh, pay no attention to my fool of a servant, captain. His brains are addled. Your Grace, I don't think it's fitting that you should ride into London alone. - You must persuade His Grace. - Forgive me, Your Grace. We were told that the duke would arrive at dawn and with a full retinue. Oh, my retinue is close behind me, captain. Indeed it is, Your Grace. We'll take you to London instantly and to your bride. My bride? I know how impatient you must be. Oh. Man 1: On to London with all haste. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [cheering] Your Grace seems to be quite a celebrity. - Quite. - So keep bowing. Keep smiling. Imagine... being taken to one's bride by a royal escort. They're not only royal, they're armed. Keep bowing, keep smiling. Oh, I don't like it. I don't like it. Courage, Leporello. - Courage. - Courage? I've gotta sit out front and wait and worry and wonder whether you're coming out head first or just your head's coming out. What are you complaining about? I'm on my way to marry a woman. I don't even know what she looks like. Sit up straight. No. No, no. I've decided. I won't do it. I refuse to marry a man I've never seen. But, Diana, it's all arranged. It's been arranged for weeks. The entire court has been invited. Why, Queen Elizabeth herself is coming to your wedding. She can afford to, she's not getting married. This is treasonous. Diana, what's come over you? You haven't been the same since you returned from France. I wish I'd never returned. You're as stubborn as your mother, rest her soul. This alliance may mean peace for England and Spain. - Yes, but not for me. - Oh. How do you know? You've never even seen the Duke. - I have a premonition. - But-- He's coming! He's coming! The Duke is almost here. Oh, do come and have a look. Have a look. Diana, my child, for my sake. For England. Very well. I'll do it for England. But if he looks like my premonition there still may be war with Spain. Come, my lady, do have a look. He's right below. Come along. [instrumental music] [cheering] Oh, look, that must be His Grace there. Ooh, he's a fine looking gentleman, isn't it? For a foreigner, that is. Balcony, 18 feet above street level. No trellises or vines to hang onto. Flagpoles won't support your weight. And if you come out suddenly, come over roof. Keep horses close. Well, my lady, what do you think of him? - I know that head. - But you couldn't. - You've never seen the duke. - No. But I've seen that head. Your Grace? [inaudible dialogue] - Your Grace? - Yes, My Grace. My son. My son. - Father. - Come. Your bride awaits you. Quick, my powder. My brush. But my lady, a moment ago you didn't want to see His Grace. That was a moment ago. Oh, you're flushed and excited. Perhaps you should be put to bed. - Perhaps. - Oh. - Come in, Your Grace. Come in. - Thank you, sir. My daughter will greet you immediately. You're very kind, sir. Diana, my dear. [chuckles] Oh, Your Grace. There's something I should explain, sir. But-- But... Diana. My daughter. My blessed child. Here is your future husband. Diana: Your Grace. My compliments, sir. Indeed, we're both fortunate. Ah, I thank Your Grace. I thank you. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll... Uh, by all means. [chuckling] Oh, Your Grace. Well, Your Grace? Extremely well. Now that I see you for the first time, i-- The first time? Well, beauty such as yours is always new. Charming. Spoken like a Don Juan. Don Juan? Darling, let's stop pretending. You're here at last. You've found me. So I have. Just as you swore you would that star-crossed night when you held me in your arms. I'll never forget it. It was... - It was... - Venice. Venice. Yes, of course. Ah, that unforgettable night. You and I together. Strange music coming to us across the water, haunting us. It was Paris, you beast! At the home of the Countess de Trouville in the garden. You swore you'd remember my kiss till the end of time. That was four months ago. Diana, darling, at last I found you. Liar. Cheat. Imposter. Oh, no. For a moment, I was blinded by your beauty. Why do you think I've risked my life to come here posing as the Duke? Well, why? You didn't remember me. You'd forgotten all about me, hadn't you? Hadn't you? Well, call the guards. Call your father. I deserve it. This time you won't forget me. [intense music] This time I won't let you forget me. [knocking on door] Is that my heart beating so? No, beloved, that's your father at the door. Lord Chalmers: Open the door! Duenna: My lady. My lady. Lord Chalmers: That man is an imposter. The duke is here with me. Yes, father, I'm struggling with him. - But he's so strong. - Diana, look-- Lord Chalmers: You scoundrel! You shall pay for this with your head. Dear lady, forgive me. You'll come back? I'm not sure I'll leave. Any suggestions... Your Grace? Not at the moment. Have you any suggestions? No back stairway? No... imposter! Take your hands off my daughter! Diana, this is the duke. This is your future husband. [scoffs] And who are you? Merely a fellow countryman, sir. Come to congratulate the bride. Duke de Cordoba: Your name? - I'm Don Juan. - Don Juan? - Don Juan? - Now, we are ruined. - Allow me. You're a disgrace to Spain. And as a loyal Spaniard I shall wipe out this disgrace. Oh, stop being so, so Spanish. - Seize that man. - Oh, let me kill him. - No! No! No! - Let me. No'. No'. No'. No'. No'.! Lord Chalmers: Diana. Diana, my dear, no, no, no. Thank heaven I arrived in time to save you. [crying] [sighing] But how I could have forgotten anyone as lovely as Diana... That's what worries me. That worries you? Merciful heavens! At this very moment, they may be sharpening the axes or rigging their gallows, or perhaps both. And you're worried about your memory. Oh, my dear friend, what will be will be. A few women I know I've forgotten. Some I... I don't even remember well enough to know whether I've forgotten them or not. But Diana? And after only four months? I must keep a diary. Oh, I wouldn't start one now. It would look ridiculous just to have one entry. Women, thy name is trouble. Well, there must be something in life more important than the pursuit of women? Yes, there must be. But what? If you would only listen to me. Here they are. Don Juan de Marana... you're paroled to the custody of the Spanish ambassador. Come. Leporello... my cape. It was only with the greatest difficulty I was able to secure your release from an English jail. But do not imagine this affair is concluded. Now you seem headed for a Spanish prison. The Duke de Cordoba has returned to Madrid and laid his grievances before the king and queen. It's not only an affront to Spanish dignity, it's a serious setback to me and to my work. I labored to achieve peace between England and Spain. This marriage was an important step in that direction. I always thought marriage was a step in the opposite direction. Well, fortunately, there are those who disagree with you. Queen Elizabeth, herself, was interested in this alliance. Do you think it helps my cause for her to see it destroyed by a Spaniard? - Perhaps if I talk to her... - I forbid it. Your reputation hardly qualifies you as a diplomat. Ah, yes, of course, my reputation. Has it ever occurred to Your Excellency, that if a man... any average man, makes love to a girl, nobody thinks anything of it. On the contrary, they all smile indulgently and say "What a nice romantic fellow he is." But if I so much as bow to a lady in the street, all of her relatives suddenly start reaching for daggers and wanna carve me up. Do you now pretend to be innocent? Well, for the things I haven't done, yes. That still leaves you with a wide margin of guilt. You were forced to leave St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, Venice, Paris, Rome. Columbus extended the world, but for you it grows continually smaller. Now you're to leave London, return to Madrid to present yourself at court for their Majesty's judgment. - Not Spain-- - That's a command! Well... at least I'll be buried in native soil. Juan, your father was my friend. For my sake and for the sake of his memory why don't you give up this wasteful, useless life? But Your Excellency... I don't consider my life particularly wasteful or useless. I'm just seeking happiness, the same as any other man. Our viewpoints differ, that's all. Yours seems to be higher than mine. Possibly because you see life mostly from a balcony. And yet I seem to have heard that when you were young-- [clears throat] We won't discuss that. Juan, my son, you return to our country at a perilous time. There are those in Spain as in England who would drive us to war. Ah, there are men of that stripe in every age, every country. But unfortunately those in Spain are shrewd and powerful. Why, even the King's minister, the Duke de Lorca. Well, at court, only the queen fights for peace. Now, you have grace and wit and daring. If you'd use these attributes in our cause... Oh, Your Excellency, I'm not fitted for a life of court intrigue. I wouldn't know what to do. Besides, Her Majesty's hardly likely to seek my aid. I'm returning in disgrace to be punished. As you deserve to be. But you could be useful to us. If one day I should call upon you, would you? For you, my dear friend? Anything. I've written to Queen Margaret urging that she deal gently with you. And, heaven forgive me, stating my faith in your reformation. If heaven will help, I'll try, if only to keep faith with you. Do so. Her Majesty rewards those who serve her. She gave me this ring as a seal of our friendship. She needs friends. Be loyal to her... and you'll find her as I have, a generous and just ruler. - Thank you, sir. Don Jose: Remember your promise. I will. I'll set an example for all Spain. Heaven forbid. - Adios. - Adios. Oh, don't you think I should make my apologies to Lady Diana? Off with you! [instrumental music] What's happened here? Don Juan: This is not the Madrid I once knew. No life. No laughter. That will all be changed now that you're back. Thank you. Couldn't we get something to eat? Welcome, senores. Welcome to the finest Inn in all Madrid. How do you know it's the finest? Must be, all the others have been taxed out of existence. [laughing] - May I be of service, senores? - Indeed you may. - Food and wine, if you please. - This way, please. The best in the house. I must apologize, senores. These days the best we have is only humble fare. What? This from a man who's always served the best food in all Spain. - In all Europe. - Oh, thank you, senores. My wife and I, we shall do our best to please you. Maria, we have guests. You don't know this place. A few lies can sometimes make a man feel happy. Excuse me, senor, is there anything I can bring you? Senorita, you've already brought me what I want. Proof again that in all the world the most beautiful... [coughing] - No, thanks. - Michaela! - I will serve the gentlemen. - Yes, mother. Forgive me, senor, we mothers can't be too careful. Don Juan is about to return to Madrid. This fellow bring the black plague with him? Worse than that, he brings himself. You know his reputation. - I shudder with fear. - Oh, and I with anticipation. Hussy! Get about your work. Soup, senores. [dramatic music] Father, the Duke de Lorca's men! [dramatic music] A proclamation. Give heed. "By order of the king's minister, the Duke de Lorca, "we call on all men with stout hearts and willing hands "to join with us for the glory of Spain "in volunteering for service with the Spanish fleet. Adventure and gold for all." Any volunteers? You, you will volunteer. Take him along. - No, no, father, no. - No, he's my son. You have no right. Quiet, old man, or we'll take you too. You can't. We are free men. [groaning] Take him out. What is this disturbance? Can't you see I'm having my meal? You shall have a carving lesson to go with it, senor. [dramatic music] [vase shatters] [soup splatters] [music continues] [music continues] Leporello: Here's another. Man 2: Senor! Senor! Senor! Oh, bless you, senor. - What happened? - Oh, it was a press gang. And they tried to take my son and me for the fleet. This gentleman saved us. Oh, it is nothing. Once in St. Petersburg, we were set up-- What are you boasting about? You think it's a pleasure for me to come home after ten years and find myself in a street brawl? Your favor, good people. Now, perhaps, we can finish our meal in peace. What-- What is your master's name so I may thank him properly? Don Juan de Marana. - Don Juan? - Did you hear? Don Juan? Don Juan! He's come back! Michaela, what are you waiting for? Serve Don Juan at once. [indistinct chattering] More wine, senor. Tell us about it. Please. You've had so many adventures. Sen ores, senoritas. All of these stories you've been hearing they're mere legends. Old wives' tales. We've only heard about young wives. Is it true that you swam the Bosphorus to visit the caliph's daughter? Certainly, my dear. We'd sank the whole Turkish fleet on the way. - Is it true? - Why, of course, it's true. It's all true. But what we crave is news of Spain. Yes, of our own country. What of the court, for instance, and the new king and queen? What? Ah, I thought we're among friends. Well, senor, the queen works for the welfare of Spain. - And the king? - The king does not work at all. Oh. [dramatic music] Pacheco, how much longer must we straddle this contraption? Yes, how much longer? But Your Majesty, I've just begun. [laughing] You have just begun. But His Majesty has been straddling for years. Be quiet, Sebastian. If Your Majesty will be patient for just a few moments more. - Oh, very well. - Oh, very well. - Your Majesty. - Yes? The Duke de Lorca seeks private audience with Your Majesty. Oh-oh, have him come in. Diego, help Sebastian. The things we do for posterity. Yes, the things we do for posterity. Sorry, Pacheco, affairs of state. I understand, Your Majesty. - Your Majesty. - Gentlemen, come in. Come in. Lorca, Rodrigo. Well, how do you like our portrait? A perfect likeness, sire. The artist has proven himself worthy of the subject. Hear that, Pacheco? It is high praise indeed, Your Majesty. Yes, it is. It is. Uh, we'll continue this another time. Gentlemen, we wish to see the duke alone. Run along, Sebastian. Uh, sire, be sure to lock up the paints and brushes. Why, monkey? Because His Grace is not in the picture. And he'll try to rectify that. [laughs] He goes too far. One day, I shall send him further. Come, come, gentlemen. He says even worse things about me. Now, what do you want of us? Your Majesty, we have received news this morning that the English queen refuses to sign our treaty of peace. She demands further guarantees and concessions. But we've already given her our word. Exactly. She has seen fit to doubt the word of the king of Spain. This is a serious matter. What do you suggest? What I have constantly suggested. That we prepare ourselves as they do. Then strike first and strike suddenly. But isn't this rather drastic? Drastic, sire? At this very moment the English are building ships and arming them. Suppose they attack first and we are defenseless, what then? It does present a problem. It's all very well to talk about war but where's the money coming from? I will see to that, Your Majesty. With your help, of course. There are taxes to be collected and levies to be imposed. This document will also help solve the problem. What is it? An order for the recall of our ambassador to England. Recall de Polan? But on what grounds? The New World is our colony, sire, and consequently all profit from New World merchandise should be ours too. Instead, it is being paid to the Count and held by him. - By whose authority? - By yours, sire. Her Majesty The Queen persuaded you to sign a paper to that effect. Someone's always getting me to sign papers. I'll not do it anymore. It'll be to your advantage to sign this one. But-- But I can't. De Polan is our friend. The queen's friend, sire. Well, why not write him and ask him for the money? He refuses to turn it over to us. He and the queen are using it to promote trade between England and Spain. Sire, with this money we could build a great and invulnerable navy. An armada. Yes, but the last time we built an armada, the confounded English sank it. Last time, every Englishman from the chimney sweep to Sir Francis Drake knew of the coming of our armada and were prepared. This time we'll build in secret. Even the queen need know nothing of this until we've persuaded de Polan to turn the money over to us. Sire, without ships we are powerless. A second-rate nation. But with ships our arms will sweep over England, Africa, Eurasia, over the New World and thence to Cathay and the East Indies. This is the destiny of Spain. Your destiny. To carve out an empire and be proclaimed an emperor greater even than Charlemagne. Charlemagne? Yes. Yes. In years to come your people will bless you for this. King Phillip: Well, this is for the people. Her Majesty, Queen Margaret. Your Majesty. King Phillip: How now, Margaret? Your Majesty granted several audiences. - They await us. - Oh, audiences are such a bore. Always people wanting something. They may not be important to you, sire, but they've been promised. But I'll have to go through all that discomfort. And I've had a very difficult morning. Oh, you haven't commented on my portrait. Queen Margaret: Most regal, sire. Margaret: Truly a king. - Everyone seems to think so. I'll have Pacheco make a copy for you. A smaller one to put in your apartment. I will cherish it. Perhaps it may reveal some of the secrets you keep from me. [laughing] We have no secrets, have we, Lorca? Our policy is an open book, Your Majesty. Written by Your Grace and dedicated to war. Your Majesty mistakes my motives. You've come but recently from your father's court in Austria and cannot therefore understand as we do the problems of Spain. I was under the impression that the desire to make one's people happy knew no boundaries. There, there, my dear. You must not worry about such matters. Besides, the audiences are waiting. If you will proceed, we will join you as soon as we can. As you say, sire. Odd, isn't it, Lorca, that Her Majesty always makes me feel as though I was Sebastian's size? Now, I don't feel that way with you. [instrumental music] Senor. I'm ordered to present myself before Their Majesties. Don Juan de Marana. Escort this gentleman to the antechamber of the throne room and submit this letter to Her Majesty. [instrumental music] Don Juan de Marana? This way, please. [dramatic music] Don Juan de Marana. Your Majesty. [indistinct whispering] You may rise, senor. No man has ever approached this throne with such advance notice. We have received letters concerning you from our ambassadors allover Europe. It is with slight regard and very little favor that your queen receives you on your return to Spain. You come back to us notorious, of ill repute, disgraced in your own country and abroad. Queen Margaret: You are no credit to this crown or to our flag. Have you nothing to say? There seems to be very little left to say, Your Majesty. Queen Margaret: You are quite right. Do you realize that you destroyed our plans for an important marriage of state? That marriage, Your Majesty, was doomed from the beginning. Those two people didn't even know each other, let alone love each other. Business arrangements can be made that way, but love... Your views on love are quite well-known, senor. We are not interested. [giggling] However, the Count de Polan seems to have faith in your promises of reformation. He must have reasons for pleading so poor a cause. Queen Margaret: Perhaps you can enlighten us? I thought myself the count was inclined to be overoptimistic, Your Majesty. Being an old family friend, he seems to find qualities in me that may not exist. However, I'd sincerely like to justify his faith. Perhaps even gain yours. Our faith is gained by deeds not by words. [knocking on door] Male announcer: His Majesty, the king. Well, well. And whom have we here? This is Don Juan de Marana, Your Majesty. Don Juan, huh? Bad boy. So this is the great Don Juan. Not knowing who you are, senor, I'm unable to return the compliment. Oh, uh, this is our minister, the Duke de Lorca. Ah, yes. I've heard much of Your Grace. And I of you. Tell me, Don Juan, do you hire men to spread the tales of your romantic conquests? No, Your Excellency, that's a service that's always been done for me free of charge. [chuckling] You have a ready tongue. It's a pity it has been used in such idle pursuits. A matter of opinion, Your Grace. Some men prefer the conquest of beauty to the conquest of a throne. Y-- you may proceed, Margaret. Our ambassadors asked us to find service for Don Juan at our court. If it pleases, Your Majesty. Yes, yes, why not? For what work are you qualified? Work, Your Majesty? That's a problem that's often troubled me. Let's see, uh... I have a small knowledge of history and, uh, a little skill with the sword. Perhaps I may even lead a press gang such as I, uh, interrupted yesterday on its royal errand. You will explain your statement. When I arrived in Madrid my first encounter was with a detachment of the Duke de Lorca's men. They were abducting by force two of Your Majesty's subjects for service in the Royal Navy. Well, there must be some mistake. Uh, do you know anything about this, Lorca? The whole matter is easily explained, Your Majesty. This Don Juan returns to Spain in disgrace to hear the crown's sentence for his conduct abroad. What could be easier than to distract Your Majesty with a story of press gangs? Yes, yes, that must be it. I assure Your Majesty the affair took place as I described it. I will tell you what took place. Some affair was reported to me. A brawl with a drunken sergeant for the affection of an innkeeper's daughter. The sergeant is reflecting on a diet of bread and water. And Your Majesty should consider the merits of the sentence for the other party involved. And now, have I Your Majesty's permission to withdraw? There are more important matters to be considered than the settlement of a drunken brawl. I must go too. Pacheco's waiting. He has to fill in my head. Your Majesty, much has been said of me. A great deal of it true but even my enemies know I'd not invent any such lie merely to evade the consequences of my actions. I shall investigate this affair. In the meantime, there's a question of suitable service for you. I'm yours to command, Your Majesty. Queen Margaret: Very well. You will become fencing instructor at the Royal Academy. And confine your instruction to this alone. Queen Margaret: You will report to the master-at-arms, Don Serafino Lopez. That is our command. It will be obeyed, Your Majesty. And may I add my own humble thanks for your generosity. You may go now, senor. [dramatic music] - Your Grace. - Come in, Rodrigo. Come in. Your Grace, The Count de Polan crossed the frontier into Spain this morning. He drives on to Madrid. Alone? He has attendants. A handful. Hardly a sufficient escort for such a notable visitor. A larger party has been dispatched under Capitan Alvarez. Splendid. We must see that the Count de Polan receives every courtesy. Capitan Alvarez has his orders, Your Grace. Good. Remember, every courtesy. Yes, Your Grace. [dramatic music] Capitan Alvarez. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [swords clanking] On to the fortress! [instrumental music] You must forgive my haste in bringing you back, my dear Count. But it was most urgent. The urgency of your personal ambition. You put it bluntly but with a certain degree of accuracy. Fortunately, my ambition coincides with that of Spain. For a Spanish empire. To be built out of the suffering of our people and to be ruled by you. The building of an empire entails certain sacrifices. As for me, I have no desire to sit upon a throne. I much prefer to stand behind it. With a dagger in your hand. No, I dislike violence. I find persuasion far more effective. And now, if I can persuade you to answer one question? You may ask it. A purely material consideration. A matter of several millions paid into your hand. If you'd tell me where you've concealed this money... It will be turned over to Spain at the proper time. For the purpose of this transaction, I am Spain. I prefer to deal with Her Majesty, not with a traitor. My dear friend, I'm afraid your long stay in a country ruled by a king in petticoats has made you a feminist. When Her Majesty hears-- It may interest you that the palace guards are loyal to me and not to the queen. I have arranged this so that if Her Majesty interferes with my plans again or rather with the plans of Spain, she will suffer the consequences. Now will you answer my question? As you can see we have several interesting devices in this chamber. They have a tendency to break a man's will. If the first one fails, we try another until we find exactly the right one to loosen the tongue. I have heard of men whose tongues have withstood it. Yes, but they now speak with the tongues of angels. You're tired after your long trip. Perhaps a few days' rest will make you more amenable. If not, well... Capitan Alvarez, the count will remain here as our guest. See to it that he is not disturbed by anyone. And now, my dear count... may I wish you goodnight and pleasant dreams. [instrumental music] [keys jingling] [music continues] If you change your mind, send for me. What's this? - Very nice. - No. No. That's a gift from Her Majesty. It will look better on me than on a corpse. [chuckles] Very nice. [instrumental music] - Excuse me. - That's the second time. That's enough. Give me that. You think I want my throat cut? Sorry. I seem to be a bit nervous. These regular hours we're keeping. Hard work, lots of sleep, plenty of exercise, good nourishing food and no excitement. We're not used to these things. Yes, but that's the only way of life for me. But you'll have to admit that they were exciting days. - And nights. - Exciting? That's very funny coming from you. Remember those lectures you used to give me? Well, I'm afraid I'm a bit confused. The sudden way in which you reformed... one reception at court. Don Juan: The court didn't do it. Well, I thought maybe the queen... The queen? What's the queen got to do with it? Ah! You've been thinking behind my back... mainly because I'm trying to lead a good, clean, sensible life, you immediately have to jump to conclusions. Just let me tell you this. Whatever my behavior has been in the past or it's gonna be in the future, the queen has nothing to do with it. Absolutely nothing. Do you understand? Alright. [instrumental music] [applauding] - Splendid. Splendid. - Splendid. Splendid. Half turn right. Forward march. [instrumental music] [clanking] [clanking continues] [instrumental music] [applauding] You may rise, gentlemen. A splendid exhibition, Don Serafino. Thank you, Your Majesty. They show remarkable improvement. - We are deeply gratified. - Your Majesty's most kind. But may I share the credit with Don Juan? Since he had joined us, the interest in swordsmanship has increased enormously. We trust he will not add any other subjects to increase the interest. May I inquire if Her Majesty is also satisfied? We are indeed. You apparently studied all the foreign techniques of swordsmanship, Don Juan. I've had occasion to use them, Your Grace. [laughs] I have not met such skilled an opponent since I have the honor of fencing with the Duke de Lorca himself. That is indeed a compliment. We consider Lorca the best living fencer in Spain. That's certainly the mark of a good duelist, Your Majesty, to be living. [laughs] I wish I knew how to duel. And whom would you choose for your opponent? A mouse, caterpillar, or perhaps His Grace. I'd considered it an honor to teach you, sir, if you like. - You will? - Certainly. Go and get equipped for tomorrow's class. Oh, thank you. I'll go at once. Do you really think I can learn? Why not? Of course, you can. That was very kind of you. You've made a friend. I can use friends, Your Majesty. My dear, you shown such interest in the academy. Perhaps you'd like to inspect it more thoroughly? Uh, Don Juan, would you escort Her Majesty? Indeed, sire. An honor. [instrumental music] You know, Lorca, we might find a use for this Don Juan. Yes, sire, Your Majesty. My own thoughts were along similar lines. This, Your Majesty, is our trophy room. Here, for instance you see some of the personal flags of such conquerors as Cortez, Columbus, Pizarro. Over there are some of the flags taken from Your Majesty's enemies in battle. Oran, Tripoli. And that empty space awaits new conquests by Your Majesties. Unless it can be filled with the trophies of peace, I would rather it remained empty. I knew you'd say that. Oh, uh, the Count de Polan... he's told me something of your feelings. Have you heard from him recently? No, I haven't. Nor have i. It is strange that he should keep silent so long. Yes, he was, uh, far from silent at our last meeting. I can we" believe that. However, I shall write and tell him how you have changed. I know he'd be pleased. - As I am. - I'm very grateful. Now, perhaps I can forget those words you once spoke to me "You're no credit to this crown or to our flag." Did I say that? That was just a small part of what you said. Would you care to hear the rest? No. I give you permission to forget all of it. I know this flag. When I was a child in Austria, my mother used to tell me the story of Ponce de Leon and his quest for the Fountain of Youth. Thank heavens he never found it. Wouldn't you like to retain your youth? What? And repeat all my indiscretions? I think you paint yourself far blacker than you are. It's the color that's said to suit me best. - I don't believe that. - Thank you. I shall try to prove myself worthy of your disbelief. Perhaps you will. [instrumental music] Your Majesty. The Count de Polan asked me to be loyal to you. To try to win your friendship. And will you be loyal? With all my heart. Then I shall be your friend. I..- I mustn't keep His Majesty waiting. [instrumental music] I'm summoned to appear before the Duke de Lorca. Oh, yes. Don Juan de Marana to see the Duke de Lorca. [instrumental music] Man 3: Don Juan de Marana. Ask him to come in. [tense music] Don Juan. Your Grace. - You sent for me, I believe. Lorca: Yes. Yes, a matter of some importance I wish to discuss with you. Now, won't you be seated? I was greatly pleased by the exhibition yesterday. So pleased, in fact, that I feel you should be rewarded. I've therefore prepared a commission, which will give you considerable rank in His Majesty's navy. It also assures you of the king's favor and my own. Somehow I feel that Your Grace is not in the habit of dispensing favors without expecting something in return. You are quite right. Yes. You have achieved some popularity since you have been at the academy. And I think we should utilize this in the service of our country. Lorca: Consequently, I have certain ideas that I should like you to carry out. - May I hear them? Lorca: You may indeed. You'll proceed to enlarge the academy, increase the number of young men of military age and add those subjects which will qualify them for immediate enlistment in His Majesty's navy. We will discuss the details later. In the meantime, here is your commission. Incidentally, I was very impressed by your general technique yesterday. Very good. Very good, yes. It was quite good. Lorca: Well? It seems to me Your Grace is preparing for war. Does the idea frighten you? Frankly, it does. I'm by nature a peaceful man, Your Grace. It's true I've done some fighting in my time but it's usually been for something worthwhile like, uh, like a beautiful woman. To risk your skin for a piece of extra ground, that's terrifying. I take it then you do not look with favor upon my proposals? That, Your Grace, is an understatement. In my opinion, your personal ambitions can only lead our country to complete disaster. I wasn't aware that I asked for your opinion. May I remind you, my dear fellow, that in a conflict, one must choose a side. The middle ground is frequently the most dangerous. I've been in the middle so many times, Your Grace, it doesn't disturb me. I see you prefer to be witty rather than wise. Not at all. I prefer to be on the side of the friends of Spain, not her enemies. [intense music] Next time, I may cut deeper. Next time... Next time, I'll wear my old clothes. Your Excellency. [instrumental music] What's happened, Your Grace? Never mind, give me that. What news of the Count de Polan? He still refuses to speak. Very well. We shall wait no longer. Take him to the torture chamber. Yes, Your Grace. [tense music] We are pleased to have you with us, Count D'Orsini. Now we hope to see more of you and your future bride before your return to Italy. Thank you, Your Majesty. And I'm sure that the people of my country will welcome this alliance. And now, we must not keep you any longer. You are very kind, Your Majesty. And I am deeply grateful for this reception. Your Majesty, I had a difficult time getting him here. I had to force him. [laughs] You may leave us, Sebastian. Yes, Your Majesty. Would you care to take a walk with me in the garden? With Your Majesty's permission. [instrumental music] I believe congratulations are in order, Don Juan. A royal commission is a great honor. You should be very proud. I suppose I should, Your Majesty, but, uh, I rejected the commission. I don't understand. It would have meant so much to you. Yes, I suppose so but, uh, I've always looked upon the academy as a school for the art of defense not aggression. Oh, I agree. I heard of the Duke's plan last evening. Surely not from him? The palace has large keyholes. My informer has small ears. I detest this intrigue, but Lorca has his spies so I must have mine. Spies are not enough, Your Majesty. I assure you, you need constant protection. Someone you can trust who will watch over you at all times. Don't you think you make too much of my danger? Well, when it concerns Your Majesty's welfare, perhaps I am overcautious. May I suggest you be equally cautious concerning yourself? If you have made an enemy of the Duke, that is unwise. Yes, I'm well aware of that, Your Majesty. As a matter of fact, it's already cost me my best jacket. Don Juan: Hot-tempered, isn't he? However, I'll make friends and choose enemies to please myself not the Duke de Lorca. I wish there were more men in Spain with the courage to defy His Grace. I'm glad you came back. So am i. Look. These materials have just arrived from Holland. Aren't they lovely? Beautiful. You've been to Holland, haven't you? Briefly. I always wanted to travel. I envy you. Tell me, Don Juan, don't you miss the life you once led? Well, I... I meant, it must have been so interesting and... And you have changed so completely. Yes, it's been quite a surprise to me too, Your Majesty. Perhaps it's because I found something I always wanted. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. A, a purpose in life, your work. My work's quite congenial, but hardly that inspiring. What is it then? Please be seated. Tell me. Shall I command you? If you command me, then I must obey. I do command you. It's not easy to tell. Like most other men... there's always been an imaginary woman in my life. I endowed her with all the virtues. I clothed her in perfection. Naturally, I searched for her in vain. I thought she could never exist except in my mind. Now I find she does. Who is this woman? Oh! You choose to keep her a secret? Only because she doesn't know how deeply I care for her. Well, you... you never hesitate to express your love to other women. She's not like other women. Well spoken. - What is she like? Don Juan: Beautiful. But strangely unaware of her beauty. Passionate too, but without any real knowledge of passion. Unafraid of love because I don't think she's ever known love. But she's taught me virtue and dignity and wisdom. You seem to have chosen a paragon among women. Among women and among queens. [dramatic music] Have you forgotten to whom you are speaking? No. Some men shut their eyes and dream, others open their eyes and hope. All my life I seem to have been stumbling around as if in darkness. I am no longer in dar-- Silence. You have no right to speak to me that way. I forbid you. I would never have spoken except by your command. Then I was wrong to command you. Wrong to think that you could ever reform... or to believe that friendship and loyalty could ever replace your desire for another conquest. - That's not true. - You may go, senor. Yes, Your Majesty. [instrumental music] [clanking] So? Don Juan? - Again. - Correct? - Excellent. Now me. [swords clanking] Arm extended. - What was that? - My new side step. Let me see it. Hmm. Don't ever side step the wrong way. Continue. [clanking] [laughing] No, no, no. What are you trying to do? Club the man to death? This, my friend, is a rapier, not an axe. Now, watch. Alright, en garde. Now, beat, extend and lunge. Thus, you see? [applause] Isn't he charming? Serafino, can nothing be done about these gaping, ogling visitors? Of course, in the past nobody came but an occasional old soldier. Now... Now we have a whole flock of chattering females. Look at them up there, looks like a hen roost. Yes, this feminine interest is surprising. Personally, I've had enough feminine interest for the day. If you don't mind. That will be all. Class dismissed. - Oh. - Really. Juan, what is the matter with you today? Why, nothing. Nothing at all. It's just a little ironic, that's all. A man gives up everything. A rich, full life. And the first time he tries to be utterly sincere, what happens? That's exactly what I'm trying to find out. Well, mind your own business. You too. Elena: Excuse me, senor. Has my brother finished with his lesson? - Your brother, senorita? - Yes. Do you happen to recall his name? - Of course, Carlos. - Carlos? Everyone is finished, senorita, so no doubt Carlos is finished too. Oh, I... I didn't understand. - I call for him every day. - Yes, I know. Elena: Well, I don't like to have him walk home alone. He's so young and helpless. Well, that's very sisterly of you. Besides, it's quite a distance from here. All the way to the Plaza Madrid. The Plaza Madrid? - The last house. - Oh, yes. Yes, on the right. Oh, on the right? Elena. Are you here again? Carlos, run along, dear. Bye, Don Juan. Good day, senor. - Senorita, your fan. - Oh, yes. You will return it to me, won't you? [instrumental music] Getting warm. It will get warmer. [birds chirping] [instrumental music] Listen. Every evening that nightingale sings here. How sad and sweet his song is. Yes. And my heart sings with him sweetly because you're by my side. And my heart is very sad, for soon you must go. - And tomorrow... - Tomorrow? Tomorrow, I shall fence very badly... because my eyes will be drawn to the platform where you are. No, I won't be there tomorrow. - Oh, you won't? - No. I'll never be there again. Oh, my darling, we'll be together all the-- No, I... I'm getting married tomorrow. [somber music] I know, you must think it capricious of me to be here with you the night before my wedding. Capri...? [clears throat] No, no, not at all, not at all. You don't? Well, perhaps... Perhaps just the least little bit. I did it so I could remember for all the years of my life... this evening here in the garden with Don Juan. Oh. Well, I'm delighted to have been of service. I don't want to marry Count D'Orsini. - The Queen arranged it. - The Queen? Yes, she did it to strengthen the alliance between Spain and his country. History repeats itself. Hmm? Oh, nothing. That's why we must never see each other again. Never. Never, never. I know you'll forgive my hasty departure. Prolonged sentimental farewells are too painful. Goodnight, beloved. No, no, no, don't. I want to remember you just as you are. No, no, it's easier this way. Farewell. - Good evening, senor. - Evening. Count D'Orsini. Well, good evening. You'll not get away so easily, senor. You're caught. The story of my life. Senor, this may possibly sound a little trite, but I can explain everything. You see, I happen to be the fencing instructor of the Countess Elena's brother and... Would you believe it if I told you I came here to give him a fencing lesson? - At this hour? - What time is it? Well, you know what they say, "Never too late to learn.? He's telling you the truth. If it is the truth, then he should be prepared to die for it. Come, Senor Fencing Instructor. You'll give me a lesson. En garde. My dear Count, can't we possibly settle this some other way? I'm warning you, senor, draw your blade. Would you be satisfied with an apology? [Count scoffs] [clanking] My dear Count, we have no argument. The lady is yours. [clanking] Their Majesties shall hear of this. It is shocking. Unbelievable. Once again, he's provoked a serious scandal and disrupted an important alliance. The very same sort of conduct which brought him back to Spain in disgrace. It is disillusioning, Your Majesty. This time I will know how to deal with him. He shall be punished, and most severely. Forgive me, Your Majesty, but surely you intend to give him a chance to explain? There's no explanation possible. But perhaps it wasn't his fault. I mean, I was at the academy yesterday afternoon and I saw certain things. What things? What are you talking about? Something was disturbing Don Juan. He was irritable and upset and... Yes, well? Well, he certainly wasn't interested in any of the young ladies present. But the Countess Elena began to... Well, go on. Well, she began to make advances. And... and you know, she's young and charming... Well, what happened? Well, I do not wish to malign the countess, but she practically... Well, you know, a man has just so much control. I saw it with my own eyes. Is this true? Are you lying to protect him? Your Majesty... [dramatic music] Margaret, we have just heard about your friend Don Juan and we're most distressed, most distressed. I understand, sire. Our court is not to become a playground for wastrels. Nor will we allow our guests to be humiliated by any of our subjects. Therefore, we have decided once and for all to be rid of this fellow. He is to leave Spain and never return. Yes, but, sire, to be banned forever, that's worse than a sentence of death. That, too, was considered, Your Majesty. But to kill Don Juan would make a martyr of him, and we would not care to enhance his already legendary reputation. Sire, I beg you to reconsider. The matter is closed. We have ordered the guard to arrest Don Juan and put him on the first ship bound for the New World. That is our judgment. - Your Majesties. - Well, well? Your Majesty, Don Juan has disappeared. We can find no trace of him anywhere. You blundering idiots. Warn the guards at the city gates. Search every house and street in Madrid until you find him. Uh, with Your Majesty's permission, of course. Yes, yes, by all means find him. Yes, Your Majesty. [instrumental music] [laughing] [singing in foreign language] Thank you, senor. All arrangements made? Yes, but to what purpose? We'll never get out of Spain alive. The roads are watched, the frontier is guarded. Why, this very inn is filled with soldiers hunting for you. Let them look. Senor, Lorca's men are everywhere. I pray you'll be careful. Oh, you may as we" argue with a stone. The wagon will be ready soon. It will take you to the frontier. Alvarez: Innkeeper. Alvarez: Innkeeper. - Watch yourself. - Innkeeper. - Yes, Capitan? Innkeeper, I need money and more wine. Sell you this ring cheap. A bargain. It's not necessary, Capitan. - If you will come with me... - Ahh! Perhaps you will buy this ring, senor? - No, Capitan. - Only a few ducats. Capitan, please. And what about you, senor? It's beautiful. - Thank you, no. - Please... Genuine heirloom. See the workmanship, eh? - Please, Capitan, come with me. - And cheap. Michaela, more wine for our friend. Juan, I beg you to consider. It's madness to try and escape. It's madness to stay. I must leave Spain. Very well, we'll go. No. Not you. I'd not ask you to share with me what lies ahead. I go alone. Do you think I'd let you go roaming about the universe without me? I'm going with you. And if I order you to stay? Then I shall disobey. Everything is ready, senor. Be on guard. There will be trouble awaiting you. I'm accustomed to trouble. Fortunately, I'm a coward. That will balance the situation. Thank you. Alvarez: See the stones, the workmanship. Would you gentlemen care to buy a ring? Not interested. Not interested, huh? Alvarez: Well, you're the loser. It's beautiful ring. Marvelous workmanship. It's magnificent. - What is it? What is it? - That ring. It belongs to the Count de Polan. But the count's in England. Go in and ask the captain if he'd be kind enough to have a word with me. [dramatic music] Leporello: Excuse me, Capitan? Alvarez: Well, what is it? Leporello: If we can just talk. My friend is interested in your ring. Would you mind stepping outside? Alvarez: Very well. - Well, where is he? - Please. - Very valuable ring. - Very. [intense music] I wonder, captain... if you'd be kind enough to tell me how you came by this ring? - I don't remember. - Oh, you don't? Perhaps a little wind in your gullet might refresh your memory. Speak up. Took it from a prisoner in the fortress. - The Count de Polan, wasn't it? - No. The truth, or on my soul I'll drive this steel right through your neck. - Speak up. - Yeah, it was the count. How came he there? By whose order? The Duke de Lorca. [intense music] [music continues] This is the final insult. The Count D'Orsini has left Madrid. Our relations with a friendly government have been seriously impaired. And Don Juan has disappeared. Completely vanished. - Is there no sign of him? - None. But don't worry, my dear, the frontier guards have been alerted. And this time we'll have his head. This time... Your Majesty. King: Well, what is it? - Don Juan de Marana is here. He begs audience with Her Majesty. - Don Juan? - Yes, sire. He has surrendered. But he says it's most urgent that he speak with Her Majesty. Send him in. Your Majesties. - Don Juan. - You may approach, senor. Well, what do you want of us? I bare grave tidings, Your Majesties. [dramatic music] What's happened, Rodrigo? Don Juan's in the palace, Your Grace. He's found out about the Count de Polan. - What's that? - Phillip? But Lorca wouldn't dare do such thing without our consent. I mean... Your Majesty... this, I think, should be sufficient proof. Yes, it is true. This is a ring I once gave him. We must go to the fortress at once. But, my dear, we mustn't be so hasty. Your Majesties, I beg you not to delay. I fear for the count's life. He's right. Phillip, please. Oh, very well. There's no need for all this. [dramatic music] Ah, Lorca, you're the very one we wanted to speak to. Seize that man. [tense music] De Lorca: If he resists, put an end to him. Stop this. Stop this at once. Put up your swords. What is the meaning of this? - Take him to the fortress. - Just a moment. Since when do you give orders in our presence? We live in a changing world, sire. Even as we stand here, the command of the palace shifts from Your Majesty to me. As for you, Don Juan... your sentence of exile will be changed to a sentence of death. [intense music] This is treason. You will never succeed in this. The people will rise against you. Shepherds may change, but sheep remain sheep. And now, Your Majesty, I must ask you to retire. I have private business I wish to transact with the king. Escort Her Majesty to her apartment. And see that she's well protected against any intrusion. And now, sire. What do you intend doing with us? Your Majesty will continue to rule with certain guidance and direction and without the interference of the queen. - You will not harm her? - Not if it can be avoided. I will give her her choice. Either the position of an obedient wife, or the fate of a meddling woman. And now, if you'll excuse me, Your Majesty. [instrumental music] Alright, open. Yes, Capitan. Well, well, my friend, how things change. I trust you're comfortable? What's the matter, can't you speak? You were quite talkative last night. [chuckles] So were you, with a blade at your throat. I hope you retain your sense of humor when there's a rope around yours. Oh, incidentally, you were curious about the Count de Polan. Oh, mercy... Mercy... Your Excellency? Don Juan: Don Jose? It's me. Don Juan, Juan. Juan de Marana. Don Juan? [intense music] [music continues] [Don Jose screams] Alvarez: Speak up, old man. Or do you need more persuasion? Don Jose: Don't. No. [Don Jose groaning] In which cell is Don Juan? What do you wish of him, padre? We have come to give him the last rites. [keys jingling] [instrumental music] Juan? Serafino: Don Juan? Juan. Don Juan. Count Sent"? Leporello. Serafino: Guard? Guard? The blessing has been given. [intense music] [grunting] This way. Have you seen the turnkey, padre? I think you will find him in the first cell. [intense music] No... Mercy. You can hardly expect us to be merciful, my dear count... while you remain so stubborn. The Duke de Lorca's growing impatient. [Don Jose screaming] Alvarez: Speak up, old man, or do you need more persuasion? Again. [intense music] No. [intense music] [dramatic music] Don Juan, here. [music continues] [sword clanking] Hurry. This way, here. [pipe organ music] [dramatic music] [no audible dialogue] You've been summoned here tonight because as students at the Royal Academy, I know your loyalty to the king and queen. I also know that you'll be the first to suffer unless the Duke de Lorca is defeated. There's only one way he can be beaten. By arousing the people. But you know as well as I do that his men are everywhere. The streets are filled with them. So we must go about our business with the utmost secrecy. First, we must-- [indistinct shouting] - You can't go in here. - How do you get in there? Don Juan. Go. - Sebastian? - Thank heaven I found you. What brings you here? Is the queen alright? At the moment, but since the news of your escape reached the palace, Lorca's become desperate. There's no telling what he might do. You must get the queen out of the palace tonight. - Her life is in danger. - There aren't enough of us. - Now, perhaps by tomorrow-- - No, no. Tomorrow will be too late. Tonight will be too soon. We couldn't even get through the gates. Do you know a way in to the palace? At the far end of the palace grounds there is an opening in the garden wall. And if you're careful, you can get in the same way I got out. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [pipe organ music] You will forgive this intrusion, Your Majesty, but events move rapidly and we are pressed for time. We have asked the king to sign a document declaring our country in a state of siege and granting us full power. This is agreeable to His Majesty. But he informs me that you are unwilling to cooperate in our plans for Spain. Lorca: Is that correct? - It is. Does Your Majesty realize the consequence of such a refusal? We do, indeed, Your Grace. But rather than deliver our people into your hands, we would prefer to die. If Your Majesty would only face reality... We can face reality, but not treachery. Nor will we bargain with a traitor. We are well aware of your intentions, Your Grace. We shall never accede to such a request. Then Your Majesty clears my conscience by signing her own death warrant. You come with us peacefully. [intense music] Guards? Come. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] I'm looking for Her Majesty. Do you know where I can find her? - Her Majesty is in the chapel. - In the chapel? Hmm. Then I better not disturb her. - How do we get to the chapel? - Down this corridor. But it's all the way on the other side of the palace. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [dramatic music] Guards, guards, guards, guards! [dramatic music] Hey. [music continues] Don Juan, quickly. They're taking the queen to the fortress. Leporello, Serafino. Fire guards, fire guards, call the fire guards! Don Juan! Lorca: Rodrigo. [intense music] I warned you, senor. This time I shall cut deeply. This time I'm wearing my old clothes. [dramatic music] [swords clanking] [music continues] [intense music] [clanking] [intense music] The sword is not for a traitor. You die by the knife. Your Majesties. [knocking on door] Your Majesty. [instrumental music] I had to see you. I could stay away no longer. Is it true that you are leaving? Tomorrow. But why? Why do you have to leave Madrid now? You've become a hero of the people. Have I? Then it must be easy to become a hero. But for a man to be leaving the woman he truly loves... the woman he can never have, that's not easy. But if you stay? If I stay, it can... it can only bring unhappiness to both of us. I know that now. You must know it too. Where will you go? Who knows? Into oblivion, I suppose, where most legends go. No, there can be no oblivion for you. Where you go, life follows. Before you came back, Madrid was dead. Now there's a heartbeat. My heartbeat. Juan, take me with you. Strange. Once to have heard those words would have brought me complete happiness. Now they bring only pain. You're the queen. Without you, the king would rule badly. The people would suffer. Your exile would be bitter. Bitter? Any more bitter than being married to a man who is estranged to me? More bitter than having you go out of my life forever? Once I promised you to devote myself to the welfare of our country. Would you want me to take away the one ruler who could bring her happiness? I asked you that when I was a queen. I am no longer. You are. You always will be. I shall be the only one who knew that for just a little while there was no queen. Just ahead lies the road to Lisbon. Yes. There's a great new university there, Leporello. I've decided to devote myself to some serious study. Perhaps write my memoirs. Well, it will be a change, anyway. At long last, lead the peaceful calm of an academic life. No more romance. No more the idle search for beauty. No more, no more... [instrumental music] Your pardon, senor. Is this the road to Barcelona? - It is, senorita. - Thank you so very much. - Adios. - Adios. [horse neighing] Juan. No more romance, eh? My dear friend, there's a little bit of Don Juan in every man. But since I am Don Juan, there must be more of it in me. [instrumental music]
