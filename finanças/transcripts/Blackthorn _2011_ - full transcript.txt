I can't come tomorrow. We need you to pay us for this week's work. And for the seeds too. You never paid for them. You know where the money is. Just take it. No. You're the boss. You have to give it to me. I can't take it. That would be wrong. I'm not your wife. Sure. You're right, Yana. You're right. I have rain gear. Mr. James, you're going away, aren't you? My mom says all gringos leave once they have lots of money. You're a gringo, but you don't have that much money. I'll have enough after selling the horses. Take care, Yana. I'll see you when I'm back from Potosi. Then I'll leave for good. I'm withdrawing all my money. In dollars, please. Good day. Your whisky, sir. American. Here. Thanks. Don't move! Come here, horse. That's it. - I'm out of bullets. - Get up. Please. I'm freezing. Are you Chilean? Spanish. Conquistador! I just came here to work. Fuck! Four days without a hat. This plateau sun is killing me. Keeper. We only have chicha. No. I want a pitcher of water. There's only chicha. Yeah... Two Bolivianos. Give me a drink. And I want two boxes of ammunition too. The same as yours. - I only have one. - Okay. Thanks. Enough already! Go to hell, man! Go to fucking hell! - Ready? - Ready. I have a gift for you. It's a gringo machine. Silver is best used for other things. I don't understand that time. Yeah, me neither. Don't do that! It's mine! Keep it. It's something to remember me by. Cheers. Cheers. To the two of you. I'm going to go. It's dark out. Yana, you know I'm going back to my country tomorrow. For good. Spend the night here, please. I can't. My family's waiting for me. It's dark out. Sure. I have rain gear. - No? - No. Goodbye, Mr. James. Take care of yourself. Mr. James? Yana? Good morning. What do you want? We found your horse in the desert four days ago. Where is he? He's dead. But we have your blankets and your money. So? Where's your friend the Spaniard? What friend? Fucking gringo! Don't move. Don't move! How many times did we go out hunting together, my friend? Fucking Spainard! Goddamn little doctor! I told you I'll pay you. I was just fine in the bar! That's not why I called for you. Mr. Macinley, come in, come in. When you worked for the Pinkertons, you came here to Bolivia chasing bandits, right? Well, that's excellent! I found my memory! And it turns out it's a goddamn Bolivian quack. If I remember right, you always said the men they killed in San Vicente weren't your bandits. Well, you might have been right. But... You're not too drunk, are you? Fuck off. Well, now we're going to see if you were right or not. Look. It's him, isn't it? Yes. All of them will apologize to me. All those bastards. What's he got? A bullet wound, dehydration and fatigue. He just needs to rest. Rest... Water! We're here. There's food and chicha in here. Thanks. I know what you are, sir. Please, don't steal from me. You won't say anything, will you? No, sir. You're my guest. Goodbye and good riddance, Mr. Blackthorn. Here you go, sir. We'll catch him. He can't be far away. Or what do you think, Mackinley? No. It's not him. It's not the one who escaped from the clinic. Cassidy died years ago. Are you crazy, Mackinley? You recognized him yourself! It wasn't him. Of course it's him! This is the man I left in my clinic, with you. We're going to see if you're right or not. We'll leave at dawn. And you're coming with us. Come on. Let's go, Kid. You know what, Mackinley? This place is famous for how easy it is to get lost. You helped the gringo. We'll take your horse. So pray the God of the Mountains spares your life.
