What do you need this junk for? - Let me help you! - No. What's up with you? Oh! We don't have a cat. - Why the cat? - Why? To make the rooms habitable of course. [Russian superstition] We'll send Sergej instead of a cat. Go ahead, Sergej! Be careful, Seryozha. Katia! Katia, where are you going? Go ahead. A kitchen! Seryozha, that's the gas! Some newcomers here! Galia! Galina! Jesus, you're all dirty already. Well! So this is our house. I see. Mama, they are shooting at me. My God, that's all we need! A hooligan's yard. Mom! How can I help? - Hey! Sergey! Give me that portrait. - Here. - Dad, somebody's knocking. - It's next door. Take it. - Let's do it. - I'm holding it. - I'm holding it. - No, no, I'll do it myself. Here, I'll do it. That's alright, Seraphima. Now this one. Thank you, Xenia Nikolayevna, now I'll manage alone. Go wash your hands and have dinner. You have a rehearsal today. Go, go. Hold this... Hey, step aside! step aside! Look at him! Oh, girls. Will he really jump? - No stones there? - No! - Or glass? - Nothing there, jump! Bring another rope. Faster, faster, faster. Galia! Galina! You'll be late for your lesson! Get dressed immediately. Girls, let's jump with one rope. No, me first! No, me! - I don't want to go to my music lesson. - Then don't. - How can I? - Just like that! - How? - Just like that! Don't go. Get dressed, quick. Let's go! Boy! Hey you! Why are you laughing? You must realize that you can't go looking like that! Who's that boy? Girls, who's that boy? - It hurts! You don't know why I did that. - Go on, go on! Dad! You'll tear off my ear this way! Must I sit here long? You will sit there until the new tenants come. As if I cared! I will sit here forever! Pour some tea! - Can I go, father? - As you wish. Who is that? It's the driver who brought our things. Please, come in. - Good day. - Hello. - I'm sorry. Here. - Oh! Thank you. - You didn't even say the name. - Who? Mine? Nikolai. I found him, he looked lost. And I remember that you were worried about not having a cat. Anyway... I wanted to check how you settled into the new place. - Take a seat! - No thanks, I'd rather stand. Put on your jacket. I'll be quitting this lorry-driving soon. I've got a job transfer to public transport. Red. Good boy! - Who are you? - Nobody. Just sitting here. I see! Well, you're free now. - Hello. - Hello. We're going to be neighbours. So I came to introduce myself. Come in, come in, please. I'm Dimitri Fyodorovich Kashirin. - And I'm Klavdia Kondratievna Davidova. - Nice to meet you! - Where are your things? - Everything's here. - Is that all? - Yes. I'm a geologist. I can give you a cot. - Hello! - Hello. And this is my ... - Are you sure I'm yours? - I am! Look around. A palace, eh? A palace! What is it? Mom lends you those chairs. Thanks a lot. So you're our neighbour, Davidov? - Yeah. Sergej! - Sergej... - Hang up your coat. - There's nowhere to hang it. - Got a nail? - Not even a nail. I can give you one. Thank you very much. Come here. This is for you, Sergej Davidov. - What is it? - It's a marcasite! A mineral. - Where'd you find it? - On the banks of the Volga. He travels all over the word collecting stones. That's his job. - Really? - Yes, that's my job. - What are nails made of? - Iron. Right. And who finds iron? Geologists. If a geologist finds a stone like this, he says to himself: "Aha, here must be iron nearby." - Interesting? - Indeed! Exactly. What must you do if you want to be a geologist? I know. You're gonna say, "study well". He's quick-witted, Lidushka! And you must also be able to get up early in the morning, when everybody else is asleep, and it's cold and you don't want to get up. Brush your teeth well and hit the road. Seryozha, come here. Excuse me, please. Get washed! How can you visit other people being so dirty! - Goodbye! - Excuse me, please. - Ok, keep your muck! - This is not muck. This is marcasite! - Sergej, come here. - Dad! Don't. Wait! Stand still! - Can you stop twisting your head round? - I can. So do it! Step aside. Se-ryo-zha, year 1935. Year 1941. - Seryozhka, are you a kid, huh? - I need to mark myself off. - Spreading out this junk again... - Hey! - ...on a napkin. - These are minerals! "Junk"... Dmitry Fiodorovich is working all his life with this. "Junk"... - A fine profession! He's never at home! - That's unimportant. After this, I'll come home for good. I promise. Do you hear me? I promise. Nothing is going to happen to me. I promise. It's myself I feel sorry for. Can't you understand? I'm afraid I can't. Let's go. - Goodbye, Davidov folks! - Goodbye. - Dmitry Fiodorovich, I'll see you to the door! - Take this. - Where's your mother? - She's in the yard. - Good luck, Katya. - Thank you. - What? Off again? - Again. - I can give you a ride. - No, thanks. Take care of your man. Let's go! - Where'd you get this? - Dad made it. Can I have some dinner? Serve yourself, Kolyushka. - What is it? - I'm sure to die. Oh, not again! Try it yourself ... The pains just won't start ... I suppose it takes time. Well, Lida... I'll be back soon. The suitcase! - Goodbye, Seryozha! - Goodbye, Dmitry Fyodorovich! So, one more farewell. - Will it take long? - I don't know. Maybe a month, maybe more. The Kara-Kum desert and oases must be great! - Interesting life! Right? - For whom? It's Katia! Hadn't I better carry you? Mama! - It's happened? - Yes. Excuse me, citizen. - All right, all right. - Don't worry, mother. - It will be ok. Go. - Here, please. - Oh, mama! - It will be ok. Maybe it'll go away? Mom, why is he making me laugh? Kolya, you go with her. - I'm the husband! - Get in, husband. - Send us a note through him, Katya. - For sure! This is good. Your turn next, Lida. Time to have your own! It's a comfort. Plenty of time. Don't put it off till it's too late. - Galya! You'll be late! - I'm going! - Hello! - Hi! - Today I'm not in the mood to study at all. - Don't go. That's what you say. But I've got to if I'm going to be an actress. You don't look like an actress. You're short. - Am I? - Yes. - For your information, humans grow until age of 25. - Maybe. I wonder if it'll be a boy or a girl. It's all over! A girl! - I was there. - And? 4 kg 150 gr. Good! - Is that a lot? - More than average. How do you know? Kolechka, dear, sit here. You need to eat now. Have you seen her? They don't let anybody in. All nurses are the same. Hello, sis! Excuse me... - I'm looking for the Davidovs. - It's in there. - Excuse me please... - No problem. Kostenka! Kostenka! - Seryozhka? - yes! - Well, hi, brother. - Hi! You're a hero! - This must be Katia's husband. - Right. Nikolai. - Nikolai. - Konstantin. - Katia gave birth today. - You don't say! - 4 kg 150 gr. - Is that a lot? - Above the average. - Epic hero! Huh? - No, it's a girl! - A hero anyway! Good for Katia! And what about me? - We need to celebrate. - Sure. I must have the second sight. Give it to me! Later. - Mom... - Change now. Same old story! - Here! - Leave it, I'll put it away. Let's go. - Excuse me. Hello. - Lida, meet my eldest. - We met already. - Get washed. Lidochka, please leave everything... ... come and celebrate with us. - Thanks! What name did you give the baby? - Maya, finally. - But Maya is a good name. Oh God, he's just like his father. - To little Mayitchka! - Have a snack. - Your health! - To Maya Nikolaevna. Here's to Katiusha! I've had enough. - To Katia! - No, no. To our Katia. And... to Granny! And Granddad! Katerina... - I'm getting tipsy ... - Don't drink then. # In the wild steppes of Transbaikalia, # Where gold is being mined. # A beggar with a pouch # Drags himself along, cursing his fate. # A beggar with a pouch # Drags himself along, cursing his fate. What's the matter, Seryozhenka? Lidia Ivanovna, Let's drink to Dimitri Fyodorovich. Thank you, Seryozha. He's my husband. He'd have been glad to join us. - Time for you to go to bed. - Thank you , Klavdia Kondratievna, I must go. - Leaving so soon? - Yes, I have to get up early. - Goodbye. - Good night. Good night! - Seryozha! Get the cot, sonny. - Right away, mom. Kostia, dear, you've smoked up the room! Very well, I'll smoke in the hall. Where, mom? Yes? - May I come in? - Yes. - Do you mind my smoking? - Not at all. - Take a seat! - Please don't trouble yourself! - Are you here on leave? - Yes, for two months. I'm on my way to the sea at Sochi. The Red Army sanatorium. I've never been there, I'm very interested. But first I wanted stay for a while with the parents. Mom, where's Kostia? He's smoking, he'll be right back. Go to sleep! I have no relatives in Moscow. Mother is living with my little brother in Stary Oskol. It's near Kursk. Right after I came to Moscow, I entered Medical College. - Why are you smoking so much? - I'm sorry. I won't. Go on! You entered Medical ...? - You find it interesting? - Very. I started studying. I frequently fell ill in my second year and had to leave. That was hard. I started designing textiles. Do you like it? Very much. And this? Even more. I hate them. Why? It's beautiful. I loved to paint when I was a child. I dreamed of becoming an artist. A real artist. You have so many books! "Determining the Age of Minerals by Radiation" They aren't my books. Good morning. Don't ... Don't! Don't! She's another man's wife. And I love her, get that? So what? You were going to leave for Sochi. Leave then! What are you doing here? The physics teacher is sick. Are you going or what? I wanted to ask you ... Ask then! Suppose you were grown up ... and had a husband ... who loves you very much. I don't mean you. Some other woman. - Why not me? - I'm serious! Ok, I'm listening. So... he loves you and then he goes away on a trip ... and somebody else makes love to you. Another man. What would you do? I don't know. It's a plane... How come you don't know? I'm sorry Seryozha, I have to run over to Xenia Nikolaevna. - The actress? - Yes. Do you know what it means to be an actress? On the stage she suffers from unhappy love. She makes audiences cry ... Then she comes home and has supper. She dies, ... really dies ... and then ... gets up and makes a bow. It seems to be a safe profession... but every role she plays costs her a bit of her heart. It's a hard profession and not as safe as it seems. Years ago, when I was 16, I didn't realize that. - Have you been on the stage so long? - Yes. And I have to study years and years, till I... Time passes so slowly. Time passes very quickly! Don't rush it, girl. Recite something. - What shall I recite? - A poem, or a speech from a play. Come on! I try to come to reason. But I can't. As if I needed further explanation, I'm at a loss... I'm in expectation... I'm blind! From whom I wanted a reward for all my efforts! I rushed, I hurried, trembling... - Wait! Wait, wait... I know, you're wondering why I recite the monogolue of Chatsky. That isn't the propblem. You must be more natural, dear. But there is so much feeling in that piece! It mustn't sound ordinary. What feeling? Do you know what I was thinking? What? I was wondering why people don't fly. I mean why they can't fly just like a bird? Sometimes I fancy I'm a bird. When you stand on the top of a hill it seems as if ... all you had to do was lift your arms, run up,... ...and fly away. Shall we try it? You try, Xenia Nikolaevna. What I said was from a play. And you believed me? Lida. Lida! Hello, glad to see you back, Dimitri Fyodorovich. Hello, Klavdia Kondratievna. Thank you. Don't you know where Lida is? - Come in and wait at our place. - Thank you! Dmitry Fiodorovich, she's here. Lida, Lidushka! I knocked and knocked. Were you asleep? Come on, Lida, Come, don't cry. I'm here. I won't go away again. I'll stay for long now. Lida... Don't. Dmitry Fyodorovich, meet my son. Ah! Nice to meet you. Kashirin. Davidov. My beauty! Isn't she beautiful? Normal. Give the baby a break. - Well? - He just stands and smokes. Good God... I tried everything ... But he says he loves her. Pasha, talk to him seriously. Speak to him as a father. Tell him he mustn't. You can't tell your heart "you mustn't", Klasha. What do you mean, you can't! She's married! Alright, I'll speak to him when he comes back from Sochi. Now let's turn off the light. And sleep. Don't be nasty to her - she's so young. Did I behave like that when I was young? Ok, you didn't. Sleep now. I can't bear the sight of that shameless woman. - Mother, I'm 17 already. - Ok, big girl. Look at me. - What's that? - I like it this way. Many happy returns! A book for you! And this... for you music lessons. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Who is it, Galochka? - Sergej. I thought it was a guest. - Galia! "Don Quixote", How nice. Come in, Seryozha! Seryozha! He's gone... Run after him! I'm not a little girl to run after him. Vadim! Galochka... - So he's decided to come back. - Thank God! One more "Don Quixote"! Igor... - Many happy returns! - Hello. Thank you. - Many happy returns! - Thank you. Come in, Igor, come in. - I'll get that. - I think it's Lidochka with her husband. - We promised to go. They're expecting us. - I'm ready. Put on your shoes. Is someting wrong at work? Don't forget the perfume. Shall we give her a book as well? As you wish. Perhaps "Structural Geology"? She'd love that. - Lida, what's the trouble? - Mitia, don't. I'll start crying. Mitia, don't. Alright. Come along. Khibiny, Urals, the Volga region. This way we geologists explore the earth. Please tell us ... Are geologists ever in mortal danger? - Sometimes. - Girls, how simply wonderful! - Why aren't you dancing, Galochka? - It's nothing. I will. Attention! Picture! Just the birthday girl. A bit to the right... Good! Smile! Good! Still! Do come in for a minute, Xenia Nikolayevna. I can't, dear. I haven't been late for a performance in 40 years. And tonight it's a final performance. And you will never, never play again? Go back. They're waiting for you. Best wishes! Turn off the music, Dad. I'm going to recite. I can do it. - Why? - For an elocution lesson. If you don't like it you can leave. She's stage-struck. I was wondering why people don't fly. I mean why they can't fly just like a bird? Sometimes I fancy I'm a bird ... When you stand on the top of a hill it seems... as if all you had to do was lift your arms, run up, and fly away. Go on, go on, we're listening. - Go ahead! - Please! Just finish your fish. Seryozha! Seryozha! What is it? Forgive me, please. Forgive what? Everything. I'm no good at all. They ate fish while I recited. - Were they at your party? - Yes. He didn't eat fish, did he? No, not he. You're not asleep? How did you like what Galia said? "Just finish your fish!" It's a pity Seryozha wasn't there. Have they quarelled again? Those two kids are capable of managing their own affairs. Lidushka, you were the gayest at the party. I got a letter from my crew asking me to join them ... Alright, that's lie, Lida. But I checked the chart myself three times. I've just got to find that marcasite. Lidushka... Leave then. Please don't say it like that. It'll mean only 2 or 3 months of work. Work, work, work. I'm used to having your work come first. I wouldn't mind if I came second. But work comes second with you, and third, and fifth, and seventh and tenth! What about me? What about life? I've bought this closet to make the room more comfortable. Why did I buy that new mirror? To watch myself grow old? I'm going home to mother, to Stary Oskol. Go ahead. - I certainly will. - Go ahead. Mitia! You wouldn't understand anyway. I even denied myself a child. I wanted just the two of us to be on our own for a little while. Because we only live once! Yes! That's the point: we only live once. It's so quiet on the Rogozhsk outpost, The trees are asleep near the river. Only trains are passing by, one by one, And they whistle, calling out for somebody. Tell me, tell me, early morning, where will we find our happiness? Maybe here, in the suburbs, Near the house we live in? I'm not afraid of great distances, But wherever your path leads you, Don't forget about the first date, and the first daybreak. How I love your fair hair, and your lovely smile, this you can guess by the voice of my seven-stringed guitar. Mitia... Perhaps I'm unworthy of you, but I can't go on like this. L. Lenochka, come here. Come here! - What's happening? - Now everybody's troubles will be the same. What troubles? In the early morning of July 22, 1941 the German army... War! attacked our frontier troops, everywhere from the Baltic to the Black Sea. During the first half of the day they were held back. During the second half of the day Red Army field units arrived, and after a hard battle the enemy was repelled... Dmitry Fyodorovich... I've heard, Seryozha. I've heard. I can't find my suitcase. You're going to enlist straight away? There's no sense in waiting. I passed my last exam yesterday. In literature. We had to write a compostion choosing one of three subjects: "The character of Pechorin", "New people" - on the Chernishevsky novel "What Is to Be Done?" And the third... something you could choose yourself. "My Favourite Hero". I wanted to write about you, because for me... a hero is a man ... who doesn't wait till he's asked ... but does things of his own accord: and goes in search of minerals and oil ... before anyone else does! The very first! And maybe factories will be built there or even cities. He doesn't do this for himself, but for others. But I didn't write it. Because of all those Pechorins, Onegins... They wouldn't understand. Yes. The most important thing is to be understood. So the suitcase isn't here... The USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium decrees: GENERAL MOBILIZATION. According to the USSR constitution, art. 49, paragr. L, the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium declares GENERAL MOBILIZATION in the following military regions: Leningrad, the Baltic, the West Kiev, Odessa Orel, Moscow, Arkhangelsk, Ural, Siberia, Volgograd, and the Caucasus. Citizens born from 1905 to 1918 are liable for call-up. Mobilization starts on June 23rd, 1941. I took some things to the cleaners. - Are you leaving? - Yes. - Now? - Yes. And what about your marcasite? Your work? You said you had to find it. Work, work, work. Mitia... Did you read my note? - Which note? - I left it here. Mitia! You never read it... alright? The Motherland calls! Turn off the lights! Turn them off! Come here. - What was that? - I hit something. Better walk this way. Hanging buckets ... Someone's bike. Lots of things. Careful! - What have you found? - A globe. It's broken. Our summer camp was somewhere here. It's quiet tonight. Like in the woods. So dark and quiet. You're going to evacuate? Mother says we must, but I don't want to. Looks like things have started. - Always take me with you. - Ok. Look they've got him! See? There! There he goes! Look, they're following him! Lie down. Lie down. Seryozha! Seryozha! Seryozha. They shot him down! - Did you find him? - No way. He spends all his time with the Home Guard. Be easy on the kid. He's young. Let him be. Well, I guess that's it. See off Katia and the baby and send me their address. You send me yours. I will, as soon as I arrive. Collect my pay and send it to her. Don't water the plants with cold water, or the roots will rot. Don't water them much after the 1st of October. You'll be back yourself by then. I think so too, Klasha. Forgive me now, if I have been wrong in anything. Come, come... Call Katerina. Tell Sergej to come and see me off to the assembly point. Don't come with me. How can you say such a thing! Don't go out. Comrades, the car's here. Still sitting around? Great. Listen, Galina. I'm telling you for the last time: if this very minute you don't come with us... I'll kill myself. Remember what I said. You're ready? - Yes. - Let's go! See that the baby doesn't catch cold. And don't feed her on the road... Katyusha, please, keep this. Galochka! Galina! Galia! Oh, Maxim, what should I do? Galina! - Yelena Petrovna! - Yes? It's going to be hard for Katia. Please take care of her. Sure, Lidochka, I will. But why don't you come with us? I don't understand. You're not a pilot or tank driver. I'm working in a hospital. - We're all set to go. - My brain is in a whirl... Galia! Galina! Galia! Galochka, my little girl, we're all worried so much. Say goodbye to Klavdia Kondratievna, and sit with your father. - Where's Sergej? - I don't know. Go, my dear. It's time to move. Don't cry, don't cry! It's no use ringing. They've evacuated. - How so? - How? Like everyone else. They took your sweetheart with them. Then keep this for me. - Will you? - I will. - What is it? - Stones. - It this a marcasite? - No. This one. Don't worry. It takes letters a long time to arrive from the front. I know, Seryozha. I'll keep them for you. Alright. I'm leaving. - Must I shave my head? - Yes indeed. Hey man! Do they ask you to show a passport? They may ask, or maybe they'll give you a slap in the neck. In case they ask for a passport, we'll say we left it at home. I won't allow it! Didn't your father write: "Take care of your mother"? And you? Return the boots and the jacket. I'll return them myself. I'll go and tell them... - ...you're my only supporter. - Mom... I'll keep them here locked up. It's so hard for me, son. Do you want to kill me? I love you very much, mom. I also respect you much. But I'm going to join up anyway. Arise, giant country, Arise for the deadly fight With the dark fascist forces, With the host of the damned. Let the soul's noble anger Get boiled as one wave. The people?s war is on its way, The holy war! Let the soul's noble anger Get boiled as one wave. The people?s war is on its way, The holy war! Let's repulse the oppressors Of all ardent thoughts. To rapists, looters, And torturers. Let the soul's noble anger Get boiled as one wave. The people?s war is on its way, The holy war! From Seryozhenka! - My youngest... - Well, goodbye then. - What? - Nothing. I said, I will go. Know how it is sometimes? I deliver a letter, then I have to call a doctor. There are different kinds of letters. Let the soul's noble anger Get boiled as one wave. The people?s war is on its way, The holy war! For the rotten fascist pack We've still got a bullet left. The spawn of humanity Must get into the grave. Hit! Attack! Hit! Again! Again! Stab! Left! Hit! That's right! Stab! Left! Stab! That's right! Stab again! Again! Straight! Stab! Stab! Hit left! Hit! That's right! Alright! Straight! Hit! Hit! Hit straight! Hit! Alright, good! Hit left! Mother! Stab! Hit straight! Stab! Hit left! Mother! Seryozha! Wait! Seryozhenka! So you've started to smoke? Not really. Not seriously. Sit down, mom. It's hot! - I've nothing to feed you, son. - Oh, mom! Lard. Here you go. Some more! Pea soup. Why did they give you such a short leave? I'm lucky already I got two days. Mom. Heard anything from Galya? She's here. She came to see me. I'll be back in a minute, mom. Galia! Galia! Galka! Galochka! Why do you cry, Galia? Galochka, please, don't! - Let's go inside. - Let's go. - It's cold. You'll catch cold. - No way! Galka... I don't even have any firewood. - Are you freezing? - A little. Cut short. - Have I got thin? - A little. Why are we sitting is this darkness?! Galia! Galochka! Galia! Galia, what's the matter with you? Do you hear me, Galia? Nothing, Seryozha. I'm alright now. I will be ok. Are you hungry? Galia, are you hungry? Maybe. Just a second. Here you are, sonny! Let's eat. She's hungry, mom! - You got up? - I'm alright. You say! You're all pale! For your health. Bread, lard. Eat! Thanks. And this is for you, from Samarkand. Apricots. Smells of the South. I'll choke if you look at me like that. I think it will be very tasty. Your apricots and my porridge. It's hard for me without Seraphima. The bombs frightened her away. She went to the country. Why are you laughing? - Do I look funny? - No, just this. Ah, a striped vest! Some good people presented me with this jumper. The sailors of the North Fleet. They also gave me this hat. I even have some butter. - Galochka, take a seat. - Thank you. You're going to live with me now. Oh, this looks nice! Eat! Eat! Tasty... I get good rations and we'll share them. I'll get rations too now. I'll get a worker's card. You're working at a factory? Yes. The one where Seryozha's father used to work. Isn't it hard? And what about your studies? Don't worry, you and I will go on studying. - When? - Right now if you like. Not now, Xenia Nikolayevna, I couldn't now. Later perhaps. Later. Home. I'm ok. Thank you. Galochka, my dear, How could you do that? I took a course in nursing... without telling anyone. We studied five times a week. Xenia Nikolayevna, now I can put in a plaster, apply a splint. I'm well trained now. And what about the stage? Your plans? Later, Xenia Nikolayevna. We'll do everything later. How can I... How can I let you go, my darling? Very simple. Just like this! Thank you. Kostya. Kostya! A notice ... Seryozha? Father. Hurrah! Hurrah! Why did you call me in the middle? Do you want to hear about my walk - Seryozha! - Mama! Seryozhka. Kostya, please! Go away. I beg you. Ask anything but that of me. Don't come here anymore - not even to the door. You used to let me come when I had two legs. Can't you see? Must I repeat it again? I've never loved anyone but him! Can't you understand this? Loved him? That's a lie! Didn't you love me... when he was alive? And if he were alive now ... I'd come to see you anyway. You know that! There's no one I need but you! Leave me. I'll keep my door locked. Always! And I'll keep knocking until you open it. - What's your name? Huh? - Mayichka. Mayichka? Wow! You're so nice, Mayichka! Show me your face, Maya, huh! - Spiny devil! - I can shave! He's alive! Mommy, is that my daddy? No, Mayinka, that's uncle Seryozha. Did you put him out? Lida, Lida... He loves you. I know.
