[engine revs] [crickets chirp] [ominous music] [footsteps clank] [door slams] [footsteps clank] - You wanna know how a 29 year old black girl from nothing came to run a multimillion dollar record company? Well, listen close. This part comes at you fast. [gun shot] [exhales sharply] That's me, Nicole Mitchell Wright. Or inmate number 237-9836 At the very moment, things went too far, way too far. [upbeat music] ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh Ooh ♪ Ooh I was born in Washington DC. And no, not the new DC, the old one, where Martin Lawrence, Dave Chappelle and Taraji P. Henson were all born, and where every day, was a hustle to survive. Yep, I'm the one on the right. And right next to me, is my best friend in the entire universe, Meghan. We didn't have much except for music. You know music was our savior. ♪ They wanna be players of the world ♪ ♪ Tryna pull me down My parents, God where do I start? That's my dad, Mitchell Wright. He was a hard working black man who worked for the city. He made decent money, but here's the truth about money. Whether you're rich or poor, is determined by the eye of the beholder. In my eyes, my father was a prince. In my mother's eyes, he was a pauper. [music screeches] - What do you mean? You only have four months for the rent saved up. We need to be in the process of tryna buy a house before summer. - Relax, we're comfortable. - Comfortable? Who says that? We live in the hood and you talking about some relax? I ain't built for this shit. I can't do this. [footsteps clank] - Daddy? - Hmm. - What's a budget? - Well, a budget is, the amount of money someone has to do things they need or want to do. - Do we have the things we want or need to do? - We have our needs. Still working on our wants. - I don't wanna have a budget. - Listen, I want you to remember two things. One, the size of what's in your heart will always be more important than the size of what's in your wallet or your house. And two, cheaters never win. [soft music] [cutlery clanks] [door opens] - Everything blew up as hell, my mother would move out. - Come on, hurry up! - And drag me with her. [suitcase rolls] - This happened about twice a year, right on cue. And as she would say, to get on with her real life. [somber music] But for some reason or another, we would always end up going back with my dad. Till one day she finally never came back. That ruined him. Because he really loved her. Love. That's a scary word for a girl. [upbeat music] So right then and there, I decided when I got married, it wasn't gonna be like my parents marriage. Mine was gonna be better. [upbeat music] By the time I'd gotten out of college, ambition was my middle name, largely due to my boyfriend Germaine. He was for sure the most driven and talented guy in the neighborhood. And we had a lot of similar talents. - Hey so what, y'all feeling this? - Yeah well, I like it without the snares though. - For real? - Yeah, especially when you add the vocals they're gonna compete with each other. You wanna sell it, right? - Of course. [upbeat music] [laughs] - Okay, okay, props, props Meghan, props. Shit, all right. You ready? - Yeah. The thing we had most in common was music. I could sing it and he could create it. - [Germaine] Babe? It was a good marriage. ♪ Call it love but you so pressure ♪ ♪ Might just walk for ya if it's all pleasure ♪ Yeah, I got sold on every girl's Cinderella dream. [orchestral music] [crowd applauds] We made some great money off those early songs. We literally made sense together. Until one day we didn't anymore. - Mummy's baby have enough to eat? Yes? Yes you little pumpkin, yes. [laughs] - Nicky! Hey Jonathan? Babe you will never guess what happened. I am looking at an opportunity to work with, Yay. Yes, that Yay. Look, so he heard a couple of my songs that I made with G from last year and now she wants to meet. Okay, what's up? Earth to Nicky. - Who's Gina? And don't lie. [Jonathan giggles] - Nicky-- - Baby please! - Nicole you know that I love you, and only you. - You know what? It's not even about love. You haven't had a hit in two months, which means you aren't carrying your weight around here. And you got the nerve to cheat on me? - She was just a friend-- - Shut up! Spare me. You must think I'm a fool. You know what I find crazy, is that we're behind two months on the mortgage, two months. And you got all the time in the world to cheat! - Look I said, she was just a friend, okay? And I'm gonna pay the mortgage like I always do. Honestly man, things have not been the same between us for a while. - Yeah because you're out playing house with your friends. You can be out making us money. - Look I am doing everything I can-- - You're broke. - Everything, to take care of this family. And I'm doing it by myself. It's not my fault you're a half ass singer that couldn't make it in this industry. [soft music] - I'm sorry that things have not worked out for you, the way they've worked out for me, okay? Nicole you're my wife and I love you, and I love Jonathan and you are all that matters to me. Everything that I do, I do for us, okay? So can we please just-- - As of today, I'm gonna do what the fuck I have to do to take care of me. - Come on, Nicky. - Yeah yeah, no! Here I am sacrificing my life and my career for you! - Sacrifice? What the fuck are you sacrificing? Look around you! What, what are you sacrificing Nicole? - That's how you feel? - Yes! - Okay. [footsteps clank] - You take your son, because I got moves to make. - My son-- - Oh you know and I hope you enjoy the couch that you paid for by yourself! [ominous music] [footsteps clank] - It's okay, mommy is just a little upset right now, okay? [child whines] It's okay. [somber music] [sobs] - I learned a valuable lesson that day. Rely on no one to make you happy. I was motivated to create my reality. Motivation, now that's a word for your ass. I've always understood that this is a man's world, but at the same time, women live here too.

His hits are through the roof and his social media following, bananas. He's the one who did that, you know, that ♪ Girl, girl, girl, girl, yeah. ♪ - That is my shit, yes! - Come here, mm-hmm. Anywho, let's keep going with my list. You need to approve the entertainment for the anniversary party. Although it's was months away, I wanna get things locked in right now. Then I need you to sign off on the new furniture for the studio improvements. And, we need to talk about the cheques that have been bouncing. You know what I'm say... Did you get a chance to talk to the accountant last week? - Yeah, we talked. Everything's okay. - Oh, I hope so, 'cause we can't keep going in the red. Company's taking a nosedive. - Meghan, that's all a part of the business. We're just hitting a rough spot, okay? - Like your rough spot with Germaine? How's home life? - Really? That's like asking an inmate how's jail. - [chuckles] Stop, Germaine's a good guy. - Wait, why did I hire you again? - Well, because everybody needs that one friend in their life, that will tell them what they don't want to hear. But what they know, they need to hear. - Mm-hmm. - Just let him go if you don't love him. - Did you forget that we haven't slept in the same bed in two years? - I totally understand. I'm just trying to figure out why you're still there. - It's crazy, right? Yeah. I grew up in a broken home and I don't want the same for my son. - Well, you already know I understand. - Honestly, I don't know how long I can keep it up. I'm not happy, and I don't even know who Germaine is anymore. - He's a producer who fell on hard times. Come on, you remember how dope he was? - You mean Dopey? [laughs] - Girl, all high school sweethearts don't end up in happily ever afters. - Speaking of high school, I'm still tryna figure out how you went from being a voice major, dance minor, to the head of an entire record label. And you don't even know anything about the music business. - I don't need to know anything about the music business, I know about the man business and you need to mind your own business. [laugh] [phone rings] - Yeah, okay we're on our way. - Ooh - Were gonna be late. - We have a big problem. - Again? - It's the music business, baby. It's built on problems. - Enter, Walter Raymond. [upbeat music] According to Wikipedia, Walter Raymond and Gerald Cole went to college together. And in the process built the first major black record label to come out of DC, winning eight Grammy's in two years. True nobles. I met Gerald at an industry party. He taught me a lot. Until life caught up with him and he died. - You know what Nicole, I love you to death, but we are gonna have to deal with this problem ASAP. And what I have to say could affect your freedom. - Isn't that what I pay you so handsomely for? Legal issues, you. Music issues, me. Handle it. - I deal with mine, I could have seen this problem coming from a mile off. - Shut up. - You ready? - Yeah. - What we wanna do, over the next year is set you up with vertical revenue streams. Beverages, clothing lines, et cetera. At Cole Records, we have a reputation to giving our clients the best. [upbeat music] ♪ Oh na na na ♪ Oh na na na - No, sit please, everyone please sit. I won't be here long. I just came to see the man who's taking over the 'Gram, Snap and every damn social media platform you can name. - Well thank you, I appreciate that. That means a lot. - No, you deserve it. So, I hear that, you're gonna take us to the number one on the charts again? - I mean, if it makes sense to us, but I think my music speaks for itself. - That's what I like to hear. I'd like to make every label that never signed you regret it. - So let's get right to it. We got the hottest song in hiphop right now. What's the benefit of him signing to this label? I mean, I already got them 100 grand just for shows last month. Shit, I got him 10 bands for a walk through. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [chuckles] - 10 Bands? Wow. [laughs] That's cute. What I'm talking about is turning bands into M's. Do you know how to book the garden, without the ice removal fees, the night before a show? Or how to collect foreign royalties from streaming platforms you've never even heard of. I didn't think so. We don't just talk, we deliver. - So, Drew, where did we leave off? - We were just going over procedures and the next steps to bringing Kingston on board. - Good, I'm hoping we have a deal? - We just need a few more days. Walter has been working extremely hard to getting him, out of his preexisting contract for Artism. - Nice. [chuckles] Apparently we have found our jewel. Let's make this deal happen as soon as we can, okay? There's money to be made, - [Meghan] Absolutely - Okay? - I'd like to raise your platform so that we can make magic and money together. - I think I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve I could show you. - Let's get to work guys. [clears throat] You ready? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Thank you. Now! [phone rings] - Let's give Kingston full access to our studio and access to every producer on our roster. I wanna create something with him immediately. Keep him invested. Let me know when he's in the studio, okay? - Done. [vehicles hum] [door opens] - Ms. Cole. - Mr. Raymond. - I wasn't expecting you. - You filed a cease and desist order against me claiming harassments. - Oh well, that was just a little, you know, pro formal, legal response to your claim. I had to do a little response on behalf of my client. - It's not right, your client Nicole Wright is a thief, and God knows whatever else. - My client claims that the company was given to her before the death of your father, may he rest in peace. Therefore, rightfully and legally, it's hers. - My father worked his ass off for this company and it doesn't belong to Nicole Wright or no one else over there. I'm gonna get it back, one way or another. - And you should know that Nicole Wright does not give up anything without a fight. - Walter, I've been knowing you my whole life. I cannot believe you're fighting me for her. - My darling Alecia, my sweetheart. I will always be your Uncle Walter, but I have to honor your father's wishes. - You can't convince me my father just gave his life works to her. This label is our legacy. What did she do to him? Does she have something on him? Or does she have something on you? [soft music] - Hey, this is business. - Okay, Mr. Raymond, I'll show you just business. [ominous music] [upbeat music] - Mike, thanks for taking care of him so last minute. - No problem. [upbeat music] - Whats up Ms. Wright? - Why the formalities, call me Nicole. - All right Ms. Nicole, what brings you by? - I am checking on my investment. I think the deal is going through tomorrow. - Okay, perfect. - It is. I'm really impressed at how quickly you guys started. Is Mike getting you settled in okay? - Yeah, I mean at this point we're just looking for the perfect hit. - A hit, that is just what we need. - All we need is a beat. - You know what they say, when you're looking for something it could be looking for you. Listen to that. [upbeat music] - Okay there Ms. Nicole, I see you. [laughs] Don't start something I can't finish - I only finish what I like. You like the beat? - Yeah, it's cool. [laughs] - All right cool. Well, play with that a little bit and let me know what you think. Mike, you got this? - Got him. - Thank you. - We gonna play hard for a little while. [dramatic music] - What's going on? It must be serious 'cause you've been texting me like crazy all day. - Close the door, please. [door closes] I have here in my possession, the original will of Gerald Cole. His daughter is contesting the forgery that we made and she was here this afternoon. - Wait, can she do that? That was over two years ago. - Well, she doesn't believe that her father left everything to you. - Does it matter what she believes? - To me or to Gerald? Uh-uh. Come on baby, you owe me. [laughs] - I owe you? - Yeah. - If it wasn't for me, your ass would have been replaced a long time ago. His family had ideas for his company and it didn't involve you. - Well, you know what, at least we would've still been in the black 'cause you don't know what the fuck you're doing, okay? Gerald Cole was a visionary. He was a genius. - He was a manipulator. And he had me and God knows how many other women doing all types of heinous acts. - Well, you got the best of it didn't you? I mean you're like, come on now, I heard you kinda liked it. I heard you kinda liked it. [laughs] - Walter. [laughs] - You kinda liked it, didn't you Nicole? Come on baby, you know what I mean? I've spent just as much time together as you and Gerald. I made you basically, I made you bigger than Gerald. Look what I made you, from what I understand, you were having sexual intercourse with him. Fairly regularly. So what I would like to know about Nicole is why won't you fuck me? [screams] - Huh? [tense music] You're gonna fuck me, huh? - Stop - If I wanted to see-- It better be worth it. [screams] - No! You're crazy. [ominous music] [car engine revs] [breaths heavily] [indistinct T.V. chatter] [soft music] [sighs] [breaths heavily] - No, no, no [soft music] [whimpers] [moans] [somber music] It's true, before he died, I had an affair with Gerald Cole. Like I said, it's not my proudest moment. It started out fun, but it turned serious as most things do. Walter was always there for me. A lot can happen to a girl in three years. [sobs] [cries heartily] [soft music] [door knock] - Wake up sleeping beauty. So you run the streets all night and sleep all morning, huh? Is that what you do? - Daddy? - It's 10 o'clock in the morning, you're still asleep. Your little son is downstairs trying to make breakfast about to burn the house down. - No, I just had a long night last night. I needed some rest. Besides isn't that why I have a husband? - Why does that sound like something your mother would say? - I don't have mother. - Well before your mother left us, you had a mother. And you're starting to act just like her. Putting your work before your kids and not taking care of your husband. - I take care of him daddy. That's why I work and he doesn't. - Okay well, obviously I ain't the one with the answers. Now get yourself together. I'll help you make breakfast. - I'm right behind you. - Grand dad. - Hey, look at my big man. Every time I see you, you get taller and taller. - I wanna go to your house. - You know what, your dad won't let you out of his sight, but I'll talk to him and you can come hang out with me one day, okay? Give me a palm. [clap] Give me another palm. [laughs] - Mitchell, what's up man? - Hey, good to see you. - Always good when you stop by. - Well, you know, had to come check on my babies. How are you doing? - I'm good as candy man, it's just, you know, living the dream with this beautiful, loving daughter of yours. [laughs] - You know I need those meds you're on. Those pills make you talk like that, I need to get them. [laughs] Hey, I gotta get out of here and get to church. I was in the neighborhood I had to stop by. But listen, maybe after church, I can pick him up for a while. - Yeah. - I'll let you know. - Absolutely, just give me a call, just give me a call, all right? - Okay. - Bye daddy. - I wanna talk to you later. - What did I do? - So do you wanna say it? - Not at all. - Come on Nicole, this has to stop. I didn't hear from you at all yesterday. Not even a call, a text, nothing. - It is way too early in the morning to be doing this, seriously - Where were you? - I told you, I had to work, I had a meeting with a client. I texted you. - No you did not text me Nicole. I didn't hear from you at all. Two minutes out of your day is all it takes for you to just give me a phone call so I have some kind of idea as to where you are or what you're doing. I am your husband. - Germaine, I don't wanna do this with you today. - Of course you don't, you don't wanna talk. You don't wanna do anything with me. You damn sure don't wanna fuck me. - Okay fine. Let's talk about it. Let's talk about how you don't want me to pursue my dreams so that you could feel like a big strong man. - You pursued your dream Nicole. And somehow mysteriously ended up owning a record label. I gave up my entire career so that you can run Cole Records. Let me help you. - No. - Why not? - One because, it's my company. And two, businesses isn't exactly your forte. The last time you had the opportunity, you failed. And I'm not going back to some apartment in DC. I made you, and I made all of this, remember? - What's yours is mine. - Are you threatening me? - No, I'm not threatening you, Nicole. I'm just... Hire me at the label, and let me run artist development. We can spend some more time together that way. We can actually be a team. And if you're not gonna do that, at least build the studio in the basement that I've been asking you for. I can still make music. - I can still produce-- - I said no! - If you dislike this marriage and this home that much, why are you still here? [somber music] Never mind, I know. Somebody has to raise our son. - Go to hell. [somber music] [water babbles] - [Woman On TV] The side walks, following two nights of protests over the police shooting of an unarmed black man. There were few people-- - [Man On TV] Join us here at Wednesday as we bring the truth-- - Nicole, - [Man On TV] And receiving a letter saying the U.S was very sorry for the-- - Why can't we put our past mistakes behind us and work on our marriage? We got so many years damn baby, and I don't want to lose you. - Germaine, this just isn't working. I mean, we could just focus on being co-parents to Jonathan. - You're willing to tell me, you're just gonna throw all of this away? Just like that? After everything we've been through. Has it anything to do with this? - What are you doing with this? - I know there's something up with you. And I just can't pinpoint what it is. And you won't tell me. And the craziest thing is Nicole, I don't care, I don't care. I just want my wife back. All I want is you. Why can't we just be like we used to be when we were kids? - Because you're not the same guy. We're different, I've grown, we want different things. - But you don't, you don't understand. The only thing I have ever cared about is you. Whatever it is that you want, that's what I want. Please baby, please come on, - Germaine, what are you doing? - Lets just-- - Germaine-- - I'm sorry, please, please. Whatever I have done, I'm sorry, okay? We can work it out, please. I just want you back. [sobs] I want my wife. [phone rings] [indistinct office chatter] [clears throat] - I thought you were going this morning to get that line of credits. - Yeah, I had to reschedule that. - Well I hope for good reason because if we don't get it, we're not gonna be able to cover payroll next week or any other week. And, are you doing okay? After what you told me last night, I'm tryna to figure out what day and time we finna whip Walter's ass. He's been calling nonstop. - Meghan, you worry too much. I'm built for this. Everything's gonna be fine, Kingston will, give us the hits we need to get us out of the red and I'll deal with Walter. - Speaking of Kingston, I'm gonna need you to look over that contract he wants us to sign, 'cause he's asking for some outrageous shit. Is he high and in demand? Yes, but, we let his lawyers draft his contract and this is ridiculous. - Give him what he wants, he's worth it. - Mm-mm-mm-mm. He's negotiating way too hard, there are plenty of fish in the sea. - Meghan, this is a once and never see again opportunity. Plus, we haven't even signed him or paid them a dime. Why are we even talking about this? Do it. He's our lottery ticket remember? ♪ Just saying girl ♪ I'll be your super star, yeah ♪ - You're determined, if anything else I'll give you that.

Hey Nicole. Hey Nicole baby, you know something, we can't just sweep this shit under the rug. - Why are you here? - 'Cause you won't answer my telephone calls. And I told you that we needed to have this resolved right away. And that was three weeks ago, Nicole. That was 21 days ago. - And I told you that you need to leave me alone or I'm calling 911. - Wow, you're gonna call the police? I'm so scared, I'm so scared. What are you gonna tell the po-po Nicole? Huh? That you forged Gerald Cole's signature on a will? That you stole his record company from underneath his feet? Huh? Are you gonna tell them, that you were his lover? - No. I'm gonna tell them, that you were his lawyer, you introduced us and this was your plan all along. That'll get you at least as disbarred. - I don't give a fuck about any of that. I really don't, all right? Now Alecia is not gonna stop, okay? She wants to know why, okay? She did not get her father's record company. She wants to know why she did not get a good cut of his primary insurance policy. Do you know, how fucking difficult it's been lying to that bitch all these years? - You lie for a living. A couple more lies won't make a difference. - She's going to the media! - She doesn't have any proof. What we should do, is keep our mouth shut and go our separate ways. This will disappear. - No, no. - What about this don't you get? You tried, to rape me. - I tried to what? - You tried to rape me, you are a monster. - If you keep up this bullshit, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to the police, I'm gonna go to the media, and I'm going to go to that idiot, what's his name? Germaine? - You shut up! You win, okay? You win. Just give me a week, to round up some money. I'll give you 300,000, but you drown this Alecia bitch in legal fees. Make her go away. [sniffles] - Okay. - No police, and don't text me. Only call my phone. [soft music] [sniffles] [sighs] The higher you climb a ladder, the further from reality you get. Or, at least what the average person perceives reality to be. [breaths heavily] See, success comes with a price. You either pay upfront or on the back end. Nevertheless, my reality was getting darker and my past was finally catching up with me. - Yo, my bad I was late. - No problem, we just gonna do these tracks. - What do we got? - We got a lot to go through but I found this one from my boy, used to grind over here named G.

Y'all think, I don't know that girl five is suing y'all ass? Hey, hold up, ho ho ho hold up. I need to talk to you about my money. All right, back here I've been making hit after hit for you Nicole. And I have nothing to show for it. - With the issues I have at the moment, you need an appointment and at least a million dollars of a net worth. And I mean that in the most humble way possible. - Did you just hear this shit? - Dad, is everything okay? - I should be asking you the same thing. - I'm fine, why? - Have a seat I wanna talk to you. - Okay. - So, I've been watching my little grandson for the past few days, 'cause Germaine found work. - Oh, really? - Yeah, and I gotta be honest with you. This situation, is really starting to eat me up inside. - Daddy, if you came over to talk about Germaine, then I have bigger fish to fry. I can barely pay my staff this week. - Yeah well, the issues that I wanna talk about are much bigger than that. I don't want you to end up like your mom. I don't want you to be the poster child for women with abandonment issues. Do you understand? And to be honest with you, I feel like it's all my fault. - Daddy, don't start with me again. It is not your fault that she left us. - Nicole, you were 12 years old. And I know you were young, but you were old enough to understand what it felt like to lose a mother. - What you don't know, is everything I went through every time she left you. - I don't know what you went through when you were gone, but I'm telling you baby girl, you gotta let it go. You can't let something that insignificant make you leave your family. Do you understand? You have got to find the power of forgiveness. I'm talking to you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. I'm still your father. - Are you done? [sighs] - Yeah, I'm done, I'm done. I'm done. You know what? I'ma tell you like the old folks used to tell me, "A hard head, "makes a soft ass." Remember I told you that. And I'm gonna be praying for you. [sniffles] [exhales sharply] [water babbles] [sighs] - Well, this is a nice surprise, and it couldn't have come at a better time. - Uh-huh, I could tell something was going on. I knew you needed something. - Why's that? - It's a man's job to know when his woman needs his help. - Oh, so I'm your woman now? [laughs] - Come on man, you already know what's going on. All I do is hustle and think about you. I mean, you've been brushing me off all week it was like, damn, what's going on with her? I just wanted some time to try and fix it. - I haven't stopped thinking about you since our trip to New York. - Oh, that's right. You got this whole other life, and I'm just sitting here waiting to get my time. - I know, I'm working on clearing that. - Can you please hurry up? Come on I got plans. - Oh, you got plans? - I got plans. [laughs] - Well, if I'm being honest, I watched my mom rip my whole family apart growing up. So, I'm not trying to be anything like her. - It's okay. Well, I mean, look, I can definitely fall back if that's what you want me to do. - No, I'm not saying that. - Okay. - Honestly, I don't know if I could stop this if I wanted to. - Good. [giggles] - So, if singing is your passion, then why don't you do it more often? - Because I've never had anyone push me. - You don't really seem like the type of woman that needs a push. - You never know what somebody needs. - Respect, all right. You know, the more I think about it, you're not even really the desk type. So, how does someone like you, get Cole Records? - A close friend of mine passed away. - Close friend? - And he gave it to me, yeah. - So you got the record label off the strength of a friendship? There wasn't no relatives in line for that? - Well yes, and no. They weren't as close to him as I was. And besides I like being out at this. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm - So you're like a superstar, trapped in a suit position. - I've never heard it that way, but yeah, I guess. [laughs] - Okay, respect, respect. - I like running the label and it's always been a dream of mine, but it's starting to get hard. - Well, if it ever gets too hard, I need you to know that I'm here to alleviate any pressure that you have.

Okay, good evening everyone? And welcome to the Cole Records 25th anniversary party. [applause] You know, when I took over Cole Records, I knew we would grow. But I had no idea that we would go from three unknown artists to three Grammy nominated artists that we developed. And nor did I know that we would have three number one hits on the billboard charts under our umbrella, as we speak right now. And lastly, I had no idea that we will go from five Grammy nominated artists, to 10 Grammies. [applause] [ominous music] - We have a great show for you tonight, with some amazing entertainers, enjoy. [audience applauds] [ominous music] [crowd chatter] - Excuse me Mrs. Wright, Mrs. Wright? I just wanna thank you for tonight. I mean nobody's ever believed in me or given me a chance, and man being on that stage was incredible tonight. I don't know why you signed me, but I'm forever grateful. - You know, I had that same determination when I started out. Plus you have an amazing voice, I couldn't not sign you. But if there's one thing I would tell you is to not let this industry or anyone change you. - You hear me? - Yeah ma'am. - I hear you. [crickets chirp] [sighs] [phone beeps] [dramatic music] [car engine revs] - So lemme try this one more time. Tell me what you did. - I didn't do shit really. I'm just an attorney, I'm a lawyer. Untie me and you know once this thing's out, I swear to God, we'll go straight to the motherfucking ATM. [sniffles] We can work this out, just-- - No. - Baby, what's going on? - [Walter] Nicole? - What's up baby? - Is that Walter? - I'm so sorry. - My God no, Walter. - I know, hey hey hey. - I'm so sorry that I hurt you. - Told you I'ma take care of it, right? - Walter are you-- - Are you good? To me you ain't good. - [Walter] Nicole, - I'm so sorry. - You see? - This is why it's time to kill this mother fucker right now. - Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Baby, hear me out. Baby don't do this, don't do this it's fine. It's fine Walter - I mean-- - I know Walter, baby, baby. - Mean, I was out of control. You know my shit is just a lil bit fucked up. - Please please, don't do this. - Didn't you just tell me to take care of this? - No I wanted him to stop blackmailing me I didn't want you to kill him. - [Walter] Nicole, I'm so sorry. - I know, I know Walter, I know you didn't mean to. I know you didn't, I know you didn't-- - Shut up, let me think. - You don't think, that's the whole thing. You don't think, you're impulsive. You fucking Democrat. - You know what-- - Baby! - Those are some really stupid shoes. - What? - Cause the shoes Nicole, they're really fucked up. [gun shot] [ominous music] - Kingston what did you do? [sobs] What did you do? - Walter, Walter? - Hey, hey. - Walter, get up , get up. Walter, Walter, Walter. [sobs] - Stop. - Okay. - I need you to meet me at the office. Go. [pants] When you make a deal with the devil, you never think about paying up, until payday. See making a deal with the devil isn't exactly what you might think it is. It's when you're tempted with something, you know is against your moral compass. And you do it anyway. Cheat, lie, even kill. And once you do that, you've entered a new territory. The kind of territory most people can't deal with. At least not sober. [moans] - Yo baby, baby? Are you okay? - No, what was that? - That was the end of your worries. [sobs] - Oh my God, what about Walter? - What about him? He's gone, I buried him, you're not gonna see him. - But why did you do that? - You told me to do it. - No I didn't! - Yes you did. I told you I was gonna take care of it, you said okay. - Yes, but I didn't think you were gonna do that. - That's what you wanted. - That's what you wanted. - No, no, no, no no ,no ,no ,no, no, no. - Nicole, have you never done anything bad before? [breaths heavily] Oh, no, no, no I'm sorry. I'm sorry, come here, come here, come here. [sobs] I'm sorry, calm down, calm down. No, no, no, no, okay, okay sit down. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. [sobs] Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, okay? [breaths heavily] Hang on, hang on, hang on. [breaths heavily] [moans] Here. Listen listen, [breaths heavily] here, take it. Now I got a show in Philly on Friday. Do you wanna come with me? - No, no I have to approve your single so it could get released and we can get paid. - Nuh, that ship has already sailed. It's already on the radio, come on now. - On the radio? No one brought me up to speed on that. - It sound like you got to fire somebody. - It's already having rotation. - Wait, no, I didn't approve a single release. - I didn't need you to, it's in my contract. I can release whatever I want whenever I want. It's my content. Plus that song was done way before I got to Cole Records. Just check with Meghan. - Okay, okay ,okay, okay, okay. Well, where's the money? - Yo Nicole, do you trust me? Yo! [breaths heavily] [ominous music] Do you trust me? Huh? I can't hear you. Do you trust me? - I can't hear you - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, - Yeah? You trust me? - Yes, yes. - Good. Then trust I'ma get this money. for us, all right? Speaking of us, let's go ahead and toast for us to be together forever. All right? To us. [ominous music] [sighs] [upbeat music] [door knocks] - Mike, waddup? - Good bro. - Feel it. - Good man. - Good to see you, man. - Pay day for you my friend. - My man, look, I can't tell you how grateful I am. - Oh, shit. - Yeah. [laughs] - Are you sure this is for me? - Yeah man. Kingston wanted to make his first payment for everybody that made his first track a success. You were a big part of that success. It's just the beginning man. - Way more than I expected. - He looking for more music too. So, if you want another track, a tour in the album we just need it like yesterday. - I thought you might say that I had something cooking already. So I'll send it over to you tonight? - Okay, all right. - All right. - Appreciate you man. - All right, look man I was thinking man, if you're serious about that label you used to talk about, I'll make some moves man. I ain't sure how much longer this situation will work out to be honest. - Damn man, that's so unfortunate, but fuck it, hell yeah bro. Look, I'll call you tomorrow, we set up something. We set up a meeting. - Sounds good. - All right, my guy, I appreciate you bro. - All right man. Don't spend all that in one place, all right? [chuckles] - My nigga, I'm married, It's already spent. - Facts. [upbeat music] [sighs] - You good? - You know they were over, right? [chuckles] - Yeah, it took me a while but, I got that. - Maybe we should've went to counseling or something. - No, maybe you should've went to counseling. - Me? You know this all started cause you were with some random Gina tree. - No, this started the moment you decided that I couldn't be exactly what it is you needed me to be. - What's that supposed to me? - It means, Nicole, the moment you saw that you could get all of this without me, you started looking for somebody better. [chuckles] - Is that's how you see it? [laughs] Typical guy shit. - No typical guy shit is me not giving a fuck. Typical guy shit, I would have left your ass a long time ago, but I didn't. I stuck by you and I stuck by my family. I sacrificed my entire career, so that, you just go live your best life. Meanwhile, your son has no idea who you are. - Because I was supporting him and your ass. - And yet somehow, Nicole, you still have not realized your idea of success. I feel sorry for you. - You feel sorry for me? I feel sorry for you. I'm fine. - No you're not fine, you're fucked. I know about Gerald Cole, and how you got the label. So you can cut all your high and mighty bullshit. According to popular belief, you are going to jail for fraud. - I'm taking Jonathan and we're going to LA. - You say nothing, I can not take shit. [glass shatters] Bitch you can take your crazy ass wherever you wanna go but you are not taking my son. I want you out by tomorrow, or you're gonna see how much my bitch I am! - Run Nicole, run as far as you want, but your're not taking my son. [ominous music] Get out, get out! [ominous music] [traffic buzzes] [phone dialing tone beeps] - Hey-- [sighs] You never answer your phone. Hey King, it's me, I did it, I finally left Germaine, so now it could be you and me forever. Call me back, bye. No, no more news, no more news. - I know this comes at a bad time, but we have 30 days to vacate. - What? - If we move fast, we can find a new location. - No. - But it-- - No! I am not finding a new location right now. - So what are we supposed to tell the employees that are left? We promised them that if they stuck with us that they would still have a job. - I don't know. My hands are tied and everything is falling apart. - So I thought it did that's why we're burn. - What was that? Say it. - Well, your new hit wonder has a history that goes beyond what's in the media. Mr. Kingston's says no knight in shining armor. He has a screw or two loose. - You know what? I can't even do this - with you today. - Do what? - You know what I can't do with you, always had a problem with Kingston, and you're mad because I'm happy - Really from the beginning I've had your back. - You ain't got my back, - You really wanna have this? - You're jealous of me - You don't want this for me. - Nicole! - What! - It's Walter Raymond. [ominous music] - What about him? - They found his body this morning. Someone killed him. [ominous music] - Oh shit, shit. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. - Nicole, get it together, get it together. [somber music] Breath.

Okay, It's what you wanna to do? Yeah Nicole, you need to get here quick. [ominous music] - Thank you. Where's he? - You just missed him, seemed to be in a hurry after rumbling from from your suite. - Rumbling for what? - I don't know. - Give me a minute - What's the urgency? - Got it, it's dad's original will and It says right there in he's handwriting, that label belong to you. - What? - Mm-hmm - Oh my God. - Does this say anything about you? - Hell no. - Look, you need anything else? - She has some other insurance documents with a signature on it. - Right, we gonna get those too. - How? - Just leave that to me. - Okay, but stick to the plan, and then you cut the bitch off. [ominous music] - All right. - Yeah, this definitely gives me a peace of mind. Thank you so much. - No problem sis. - Thank you. - We're gonna back what is yours. [phone dials] - Its okay, actually hang on a second [phone rings] Hold up, Yo, wassup? Wassup? Where are you? You haven't answered my calls and then, you come to my office, disrespecting my employees. - Yo chill out, I've been busy. Whatchu you've been listening to the radio? I Just hit number one. - You mean we just hit number one? Look, I need to see you. - That's funny, I gotta talk to you too. Where are you at? - The office? - Can you come please? - Okay, babe. Hey we on. [car alarm squeaks] [engine revs] - Why aren't you return my calls? - Baby relax, I told you I was busy. - Too busy for me? Look, they found Walter's body and I haven't been able to eat, I haven't been able to sleep, I don't know what to do, - I don't know where we-- - Relax, relax. - Hey this is okay, come here. It's okay, come here, come here, it's cool. You're good? You good? - Yeah. - We gon get through all of that. - Yeah, yeah. - But, I wanna celebrate first. - You wanna celebrate? - No. - Whatchu saying? - Getting paid would be celebration enough. We need to talk about your streaming sales. Where's the revenue from your sales going? I haven't seen any money. - You know I ain't been in his room since I was like nine years old. [ominous music] And it seemed so much bigger back then too. - What are you talking about? - Damn baby, I just don't think I can do this anymore. - Wait, are you breaking up with me? - Not quite. But I am done playing games with you. - Baby, what are you saying? - You're cold bitch, you know that? - Why are you talking to me like that? - Because I know. - Know what? - I know what you and Walter took from my father. - Your father? - Gerald Cole. [ominous music] - Oh my God. - Mm-hmm I spent my entire life watching him build Cole Records from the ground up. And you and Walter took it from him in his last moments. That's crazy, right? - You have no idea what your father did to me and countless other women. We just wanted to sing. Between being used and drugged, he made show pieces for his old ass friends. - What the fuck does that have to do with you taking the company from Alecia? Walter already told me that this was your idea. - And you believe Walter? - Stop asking me all these goddamn questions! - I'm calling the police. - You won't get the chance, but you do have a chance to sign these papers here. They pretty much say that you forged my father's signature and stole the company. - No. [indistinct office chatter] - You're gonnna sign these papers or I'ma burry you next to Walter. - You're crazy. [chuckles] - You know this tops crazy. Sign these goddamn papers. - I'm gonna tell the police that you killed Walter. - I will not say it again. [screams] [moans] - Over there, its over there, that way. [indistinct office chatter] [screams] - Kingston, what y'all doing man? [screams] [gun shot] [screams] - Hey, move! [ominous music] [soft music] One thing I've learned over the course of my life is that, when it rains, it pours. But after all that transpired, all the conspiring all the deceit, for some reason or another and only he and God knows, Kingston never mentioned my name in his murder trial of Walter, not once. [somber music] Either way, the other powers that be had had enough. Today was D-day at Cole Records. [office phone rings] - Attention everyone! Stop where you are, step away from your desks. This company is now under the order of the U.S federal law. It's being here by shutdown effective immediately, and all materials are being seized. The feds have been building a case there since day one. This whole Kingston situation just gave them the cornerstone piece to the puzzle that they've been looking for. And while they were taking down all my friends at the label, out of all places, I was picked up at my son's school, in front of the entire student body. [soft music] Karma is a bitch. - Stop making this so difficult ma'am, I'm taking you outta here one way or the other. If I have to, I will carry you out of here. - So why don't you try? - Yeah, you need to knock this off and just get moving. Come on, there, relax. [indistinct chatter] - Is there anything you would like to say to the court before I impose your sentence? - Yes, your honor. I just want to apologize to my family for everything I did. [sobs] If I could turn back the clock, I would have been a better wife and a better mother and a better daughter and a better friend. [somber music] [sobs] When daddy told me that cheaters never win, he was right. I'm so sorry. - Now in the matter of forgery, count one, three to five years. Count two three to five years. Count three, three to five years. Count four three to five years. And count five, three to five years. All sentences to run concurrently. [bangs gavel] For those who don't know what concurrent means, it means I have to serve a maximum of five years, a minimum three. [cuffs clicks] [sobs] Some people might say I had more ambition than talent. Some might even say I just came from bad stock. But I'd say, our lives are just a reflection of an accumulation of the choices we make. You know what I regret the most? When I look back at everything, I could've just as easily achieved success the right way and still had my family. But like they say, hindsight is 2020 vision. But trust me, I'll get it right the second time around, Lord willing.
