Colored and Improved by BanglarBagh GENE: The world we live in. It's so wondrous, mysterious, even magical. No. No, not that world. I meant this one. The smartphone. Each system and program and app is its own little planet of perfect technology, all providing services so necessary, so crucial, so unbelievably profound. - (GASPS) Look who just sent me a text. - Hmm? Addie McAllister? Must be a mistake. Or a joke. Or a scam. Don't send her your Social Security number. - Dude. Shh! - (GRUNTS) She's right there. GENE: That's our user, Alex. And, like every freshman in high school, his whole life, everything, revolves around his phone. (BOYS GRUNT) (BOYS LAUGHING) (CAMERA CLICKS) (BUS BRAKES HISS) (TEXT MESSAGES BEEPING) And, as the pace of life gets faster and faster... - TEACHER: Phones down in five. - (GIRL LAUGHS) GENE: And attention spans get shorter and shorter and... You're probably not even listening to me right now. Who has the time to type out actual words? And that's where we come in, the most important invention in the history of communication... Emojis. That's my home. (WHOOPING) Textopolis. Here, each of us does one thing, and we have to nail it every time. (LAUGHING AND WHOOPING) The Christmas Tree just has to stand there all festive. Merry Christmas. It's still September, Tim. - GENE: The Princesses... - Ah, I am so pretty. GENE: They just got to wear their crowns and keep their hair combed. - You guys, we are so pretty. - Oh! Ooh! (LAUGHING) GENE: Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up. - They just show up, and they're good to go. - Oh! GENE: But for the faces, the pressure is on. Crier always has to cry, even if he's just won the lottery. Hooray! I'm a billionaire! GENE: The Laugher is always laughing, (LAUGHING) even if he's just broken his arm. I can see the bone! (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) GENE: Now, me, I'm a Meh. So I got to be totally over it all the time, you know, like, "Meh, who cares?" Which is not as easy as it sounds. (SINGING) ♪ I gotta be ♪ ♪ Meh ♪ ♪ I gotta be ♪ ♪ Meh ♪ Morning, Mrs. D. I see you have the little minis with you. Oh, they're so cute. (SQUEAKING AND COOING) (MUFFLED GRUNTING) (YAWNS) (STRAINING) (GIGGLES) (STRAINING) That is so adorable, I can't take it! (ALL CRYING LOUDLY) Now I'll never get them to sleep. Stick to your one face, weirdo. (SINGING) ♪ Olé! Olé! ♪ No! Oh, No! GENE: It's hard to always act blasé, when living in Textopolis is just so exciting. (BRITISH ACCENT) Hello, good simians. Those are some sharp attachés. Yes, well, we have business to attend to. - What kind of business? - Monkey business. (MONKEYS SCREECHING AND CHATTERING) (NORMAL ACCENT) Ooh, ooh! I sounded British! (CHUCKLES) Meh. Oh, that was really good. Meh. Meh. (LAUGHS) That was a great... - Whatcha doing there, mate? - Practicing. Today is my first day on the phone. Oh, boy. I'm gonna be so meh. What are you gonna do? Ah, me and the boys are gonna throw ourselves on the barbie! Here's my sauce now. G'day, mate. Hey. Konnichiwa. - (EMOTICONS GRUNTING) - Ooh, sorry, emoticons! I hate knocking over the elderly. Here, let me help, let me help. (GROANS) Oh, my colon! - (GASPS) Is that the time? - Hey, my eyes are up here, pal. (WHOOPING) GENE: Yeah! All right! (WHOOPS) Right on time. (BREATHES DEEPLY) (LAUGHTER) ELEPHANT: So, last week, - Alex sends me next to this guy. - (LAUGHING) Huh? Huh? (LAUGHING) That kid! Where does he get this stuff? (STRAINS) (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) Why are you laughing, freak? (DERISIVE LAUGHING) GENE: Now, unlike me, my parents are total pros. Gene, please tell me you weren't laughing just now. In public. Uh... Oh, he was. I remember. Let's go somewhere more private. I have some bad news, Gene. And I'm afraid you'll have the wrong reaction. Okay. What's the wrong reaction? Anything other than "meh. " Mmm. Come on. I don't want to be late. I'm not letting you go to work today. - Wait, what? - You're just not ready, son. Come on! Working in the cube is an emoji's whole purpose in life. Everybody my age is working on the phone except for me. - Oh, sweetie, that's not true. - (TOILET FLUSHING) Aah! Yeah! I'm gonna work on the phone, and I'm only 10. That's because I believe in you. Should we wash our hands? (BOTH LAUGHING) POOP: No, no, no. POOP AND POOP JR.: We're number two! We're number two! We're number two! See? I... I know I'm different, okay? But when I need to, I can be meh. I just... I want to be a working emoji, you know, like... Like everybody else, and then... Then I would finally fit in, you know? Oh, you fit in, honey. No, I don't, Mom. I never have. But I can change all that if you'd just let me. Just give me a chance. But what if you get sent out on the phone, making the wrong face? No, Dad, I'll make the right face. Look. Meh... You're so handsome when you make that face. I think he's ready, Mel. Meh. Come on, Dad. Let me prove it to you. If you really think you're ready. I am! Yes! Yes. I promise, I won't let you down. Stop. (CHUCKLES) (GIGGLES) Oh! (SIREN WAILING) (EMOJIS LAUGHING) (LIVELY CHATTER) Wow. SMILER: Congratulations, everyone! What an exciting day for all of you. Oh, it's really her. - Oh, Pizza! (LAUGHING) - (PIZZA GASPS) - Ow! Hey! - Your first day on the job. (CHUCKLES) Hi. Hi. Don't be nervous. I won't bite. Hi. I'm Smiler. (GIGGLING) Uh-oh, don't touch me. - Hi! - Okay. I mean, hey. As you know, I'm Smiler. I am the system supervisor here because I was the original emoji. (GIGGLES) (EXCITED GASPING) Here's how it works. It's nothing fancy. Wait a minute. It's really fancy! (EMOJIS GASPING) (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) You each have your own cube on the emoji bar. If Alex chooses you, should you be so lucky, your cube will light up. Oh. It's showtime. SMILER: The scanner will scan you, and that scan will get sent right up to Alex's text box. And let me tell you, guys, (CHUCKLES) there is nothing like getting scanned for the first time. You're gonna love it. Really. - (WHISPERS) Wow. - Now, over here is the favorites section where you'll find all the most popular emojis. And, of course, you'll find my cube here. (LAUGHS) Whew. You are smooth. Just doing my duty. - (LAUGHS) - What? What did I say? Rocket looking to party. (WHOOPS) Come on, tell me you aren't just a little bit tempted. Steven, for the last time, - I don't want to buy a time-share. - (LAUGHS) Come on, man, it's Hi-5. You know me, I'm a favorite. Alex hasn't picked you in weeks. And if he stops picking you, you're no longer a favorite. It's got to be some sort of mistake. I mean, look at me, I'm an attractive hand giving a high five. - Oh. Fist Bump. Come on in. - Hey. - Ladies. - Fist Bump? He's a knucklehead. Literally. Look at him. I can look like that. - (KNUCKLES CRACKING) - Aah! Ow! Cramp. Huge mistake. (GRUNTING) Help. Help me. Help up the hand. - (GRUNTS) There you go. - Thanks, mate. Hey, little Meh, how about you create a distraction, and then I'll just slip under the rope? - Uh-oh. Is someone lost? - (HI-5 SIGHS) Smiler, hi. Just leaving. Yeah, you know, just killing time before I go back to my cube in the far corner where Alex can't even see me anymore! You may not be a favorite anymore, but you will always have a place in the cube. Yeah, in the nosebleeds. Uh, I'm standing right here. Words hurt. The most important thing I can tell you is to just be yourself. (MOCKING GIBBERISH) Blah. I was made to be happy, so I am always smiling. (LAUGHS) REGGIE: (OVER SPEAKERS) Places, please. Emojis to your cubes. Attention. We've got incoming. Got to be meh. Got to be meh. Oh, my gosh, my own cube. I can't believe it. Oh, oh. I could put a plant over here. And over here could go an inspirational calendar. Okay. Got to be meh. Got to be meh. MARY: Look at our son down there. I'm just beaming with pride. You don't think he'll actually get picked, do you? Hie-ro-gly-phics. Hieroglyphics was an ancient language of picture forms. Does that remind anyone of anything? Hello? A language of pictures. Anyone? (SIGHS) Early hieroglyphs date back as far as 3,300... (SOFTLY) I got to reply to Addie's text. - What should I write? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Words aren't cool. (GASPS) Okay. Be cool. Be cool. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) All right, Alex is not sure how he wants to play this. Oh, I would really love it to be me. Beam me up! Beam me up! I need Thumbs Up on standby. Oh, yeah! Thumbs Up is going in! (PANTING AND GRUNTING) REGGIE: Wait! Alex is changing his mind. He's moving. (GASPS) Okay. Looks like it's gonna be Meh. I'm so nervous, I could almost shrug. We are go for Meh. Initiating scan. Okay. You can do this. - (SCREAMS) I can't do this! I can't do it! - What is this? - (SCREAMS) - Stop the scan! I can't! It's too late! (PANICKED GASPING) Meh, meh, meh, meh. My goodness, I'm freaking out! - What's he doing? - He's making the wrong face! Good for him! Little... Wait, what? - Be meh! Be meh! Be meh! - (BOTH SIGH) Abort! Abort! Oh! Shut it down! Shut it down! (BOTH SCREAM) (TEACHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (PHONE CHIMES) ALEX: What is that emoji? - Wrong emoji sent! Evacuate the Meh cube! - (WHIMPERING) (ALARM BLARING) (PANICKED CHATTER) - REGGIE: Evacuate the cube! - I got to get out of here. (SCREAMS) Whoa, whoa! (GASPING) REGGIE: Get that bozo out ofthere! I'm trying! (YELLS) (GASPING AND SCREAMING) (GASPS) (YOWLING) (DISTORTED) No! Oh, my God. (LOUD SCRAPING) (GROANING) POOP: Oh, the humanity. (STRAINING) Medic. (COUGHING) Sorry, everybody. That was not what I meant to do. (CHUCKLES) I kinda... I kinda panicked. Are you even a Meh at all? - Uh, who? Me? - Course he is. He's my spitting image. If you have expressions other than meh, what you are is a malfunction. (CHUCKLES AND SIGHS) (EMOJIS MURMURING) Malfunction? No! I can be meh. Just give me one more chance. Oh, that's not gonna happen. (GASPS) You know what would be really fun? A board meeting. Where we could figure out what to do with you! (SMILER GIGGLING) (AMBULANCE BEEPING) (SIREN WAILING) - I knew there was something wrong with him. - A malfunction? - What's gonna happen to him? - EMOJI 1: He can't work on the phone. EMOJI 2: What would Alex think? EMOJI 3: That's the guy. EMOJI 4: What do his parents think? (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) I just wanted to be useful, you know? Fit in. Now everybody thinks I'm a malfunction. (SCOFFS) I am a malfunction. Even if you are a malfunction, Gene, your mom and dad still love ya. I knew you weren't ready. Let's get you out of here and take you home. One day, all this will blow over, and everyone will almost forget about what you did. Until then, you should probably stay locked up in the apartment. Wait. You want to hide me away? You're embarrassed of me. It's for your own safety. We're trying to protect you, son. Gene? Where are you going? I'm not gonna run away from this. I'm an emoji, and even though I'm not sure exactly which one, I've got to have some sort of purpose here. - I know it. - (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Gene, no. Sweetie, please. Oh, boy. EMOJI 1: A malfunction... EMOJI 2: Order! Order! - (GAVEL BANGING) - The motion is carried. (GASPS) - So, how'd it go, Gavel? - Hmm. Hey, Light Bulb, tell me what's going on in there. (GASPS) What? Poop, what is it? Tell me, turd. Tell me true. What happened? I know it was an accident. We all have accidents. You're so soft, Poop. Not too soft, I hope. - SMILER: Gene! - (SHRIEKS) We were just gonna come looking for you. Why don't you come inside the boardroom, and we can have a teeny, weeny chat. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) (CHUCKLES) Um, I came up here to defend myself, but you seem pretty happy. So, good news? (LAUGHS) Right. I'm always happy. Oh, right. Hashtag truth. (CHUCKLES) SMILER: Well, the only thing that could ever make me unhappy is if one of our emoji team made a mistake, which caused Alex to lose faith in the phone. - Oh. - Ooh. And then our whole world gets wiped out. (LAUGHS) Smiler, I double-pinky-swear promise to you that I will never, ever make a mistake in the cube again. Oh, we know you won't, Gene. (LAUGHS) We know you won't. (CHUCKLES) You know, the first time you said it, it sounded genuine, but then you repeated it, and then, that was weird. - (GASPS) - That's because we're setting you up with our best Anti-Virus Bots. (WHIRRING) So, they'll like, uh... They'll just... They're gonna fix me? Actually, delete you. But yes! - Wait, what? - If you get deleted, (MUFFLED) you don't have to worry about what your purpose is or the future or why you're such a malfunction. 'Cause you're deleted, right? All right, good talk. - Bots! (LAUGHS) - (ELECTRICAL WHOOSHING) Oh. (BEEPING AND WHIRRING) No! (HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING) SMILER: Don't let him escape! HI-5: Party time! Wait a minute... (LIVELY CHATTER) (HI-5 INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY) The air is better here. (LAUGHS) - Beer, Tea. - I'm Coffee! Sorry. Sheesh. So edgy. (LATIN MUSIC PLAYING) (HI-5 GASPS) (EXHALES HEAVILY) Oh, my old cube. - (GRUNTS) - Take a hike, Mike. My name's not Mike. (SCREAMS) What? - There's AV Bots coming! - For me? Just because I'm in the wrong section? (ALL GASPING) (ELECTRICAL WHOOSHING) - Holy deleto! - (EMOJIS CLAMORING) - Whoa. - (PANTING) (GASPS) (PANTS) - What do we do? - Quick! This way! Let's go. Don't tell anyone you're about to see this. They'll never find us down here. GENE: Where are we? The basement? No. Welcome to the Loser Lounge, where the emojis who never get used hang out. ♪ Squares never fit in a circle of friends... ♪ Go fish, Fish Cake With Swirl. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) BROOM: Sweep so you won't cry. Sweep so you won't cry. (SOBS) Sweep so you won't cry. I almost got deleted. Me, Hi-5. Hey. What's up, Hi-5? They weren't trying to delete you. They were trying to delete me. You? What's so important about you they'd send out an entire team of Bots? They say I'm a malfunction. (ALL GASP) (MUSIC STOPS) (VIDEO GAME BEEPS) Oh, you bringing malfunctions in here now, Hi-5? For crying out loud, Abandoned Luggage, that had better not be my leftover Chinese food. Uh... What Chinese food? (HICCUPS) (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) Do you have any idea what it's like to be living large, hashtag blessed, the favorite of the favorites, and then demoted to this pit of despair? Here, will you hit my calluses for me? At least you're a working emoji. That's all I ever wanted. Well, if that's all it'll take for you to be satisfied, then just find a hacker and get reprogrammed. It's not that complicated. Where would I find a hacker? In the Piracy app. Duh. Ah, who took my clear nail polish? - Ugh. - Piracy app? To get there, I mean, I'd have to leave Textopolis. So? I've done it. Would you be a brother? One of the Princess emojis left the phone altogether. Now she lives on the cloud. Mmm. Oh, that is good. I'm sure the hacker that helped her do that could easily reprogram you. - The name's Jailbreak. - Jailbreak? That's great! Reprogrammed. I just need to be reprogrammed, and then, I can finally be the Meh I was meh to be. Help me find that hacker, Hi-5. Will you? Please? Maybe this hacker could help you, too. Like rewrite some code, get you into the favorites section. (GASPS) Wait a minute. - (SNAPS FINGERS) - Ow. I've been trying to use my charisma and sense of entitlement to get me back on top, but all I need is a hacker. Today's your lucky day. Let's roll. Hey, can I come, too? - Talk to the hand, Red Wagon. - (WHIMPERS) (CRASH) I thought I was. Bye, Felicia. (VIDEO GAME BEEPS) (GRUNTS) - Ciao, Fish Cake with Swirl. - (LAUGHS) Daddy's heading back to the VIPs where he belongs! Wait. What about the Bots? Good point. Good point.

I shouldn't have picked it. - You didn't even try to get the tree. It's baffling. Let's go. (QUIET SNORING) Hi-5? Hello? Hi-5? - Where are you? - HI-5: I'm right here! - Gene! - (SHRIEKS) Here we are, end of the text app. (WHOOSHING) No way. Come on, Gene. It's perfectly safe. - (SCREAMS) Oh, no! - Gene, help me! - The wallpaper monster's got me! - Oh, no! Hold on, hold on! - (HI-5 SCREAMS) - Hi-5! Oh, no. This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Hi-5! I'm... - I'm just messing with you. - Huh? It's one of those rubber finger-monster puppets from the '80s. I collected the whole set. All right, you coming? - Uh, what do I do? - What do you mean? Just take a step through the other side. GENE: This is it. The next time I come back here, I'll be a real Meh. Hi-5? (WHOOSHING) (ELECTRICITY RUMBLING AND CRACKLING) No! Whoa!

Whee! - Bubble Pups? - They're stickers, Gene. Try to get with the program. This is so cool. Wait. What's in that one? WOMAN: Guys, look at this picture. Look at my baby. MAN 1: This is what I ate for breakfast. - This is what I ate for lunch! - MAN 2: Here's me on a hike! Here's me in the gym! Here's me in the bathroom! Everybody's talking about themselves. (CHUCKLES) How does he know so many people? None of these people know him, but they like him, and that's what matters in this life, popularity. Uh... I... I think I'd... I think I'd rather just have a real friend. HI-5: A real friend? How's that gonna get you anywhere? What you need are fans. They give you complete and unrelenting support. As long as you're on top. MARY: Poor Gene. I blame myself. I blame you, too. I just wanted to be supportive. You just wanted a vacation. (GASPS) You take that back, Mel Meh. (SIGHS) (WHOOSHING) Bots. If they haven't found Gene by now, he must have skipped town. You mean the Wallpaper? Our boy's on the run. How about we find him ourselves? Yeah, for sure. (QUIET ELECTRICAL RUMBLING) Tell all Bots to follow those Mehs. I'm sure they'll know all the freaky-deaky apps Gene will hide out in. I'm really good at making plans, you guys. (LAUGHS) Right? HI-5: Here we are. The Piracy app. This is where we'll find Jailbreak. Um... But this is the Dictionary. That's just what Alex wants his parents to think. This is called a skin. Really?

Right, Hi-5? - (LICKING NOISILY) Ow! - Hey, Fingers! You want to focus? For your information, I happen to have a sugar addiction, - and it's a very serious... - Listen, Finger Head! We have to get Gene out of the game without blowing him up. - (GULPS) - I don't want to blow up. We have to match up the candies, so that Gene will drop to the bottom. And we can't match him with any yellows, or else... Aah! Don't do that. Please don't do that. Watch. - You got it? - Match three in a row. Don't blow Gene up. Got it. And we have to be very careful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful. (WHOOPS) Candy! - Watch it! - HI-5: Hey! Whoa! GENE: No! No, no, no! Slow down. Not the yellows! Not the yellows. - I said careful! - (HI-5 YELLS) My mom just joined Facebook. Can you believe she wanted to friend me?

We line you up with the yellows. But you said not to do that. Special candies get transported to that jar. The game might think you're a special candy. And what if it doesn't think I'm a special candy? Well... (GASPS AND SHOUTS) (YELLING) (BOTH SCREAMING) - GENE: Jailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak? - Oh. Uh, sorry. What if it doesn't think I'm a special candy? Oh, I'm not too worried about it. Okay, just do it. (RUMBLING) (BEEPING) HI-5: Gene! Gene? Hey. Oh. Oh, no! Gene! You're alive! (KISSES) You were trying to see if I had somehow turned into candy, weren't you? Yes, I was. And you have not. (QUIET BEEP) Hey. Looks like something popped up on Alex's calendar. Eh, I'm sure it's nothing. NERD EMOJI: Uh, Alex made an appointment at the phone store. (CLAMORING) (MONKEYS SCREECHING) Oh, no! Oh! (CRYING LOUDLY) SMILER: Calm down, everyone! Calm down. Don't worry. Everything is fine. Maybe Alex just wants to buy some accessories. Uh, his appointment is with technical support. Well, I'm sure we still have plenty of time to figure this out. Hmm? - Uh, his appointment is for tomorrow. - (GARGLES) Then maybe it's just for some routine maintenance. Uh, actually, it's to erase the phone. (SMILER GRUNTS QUIETLY) JAILBREAK: Listen, Gene, I'm about to become your knight in shining armor. - You are? - Oh, yeah. (SHOUTS) Ow! JAILBREAK: But first, we need to get uploaded to the cloud. That's where we'll find the source code to reprogram you. - The cloud? - (HI-5 WHOOPS) Isn't that off the phone? Ding, ding, ding, ding. You got it. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, the cloud. Off the phone. (CHEWING NOISILY) We're in Candy Crush, obvs. I know a shortcut to Just Dance, which is right next to Dropbox, where we can get uploaded to the cloud. Mmm! Of course. Just Dance, then boogie over to Dropbox, catch the link, and zoom. Hold up. Here's the stinker. Before they let us into the cloud, we have to get past this firewall. (HI-5 AND GENE SHRIEK) - The firewall uses face identification. - Yeah, the firewall. Mmm. Mmm-hmm. Which is really annoying, because I've already tried to get through. Guessed wrong once, and now I'm locked out for life. HI-5: Locked out for life? Oh, you're thinking, 'cause I can make different faces, - the firewall will think I'm different emojis. - Yeah. I wanted to say it 'cause it was my idea. You know, women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for. - You know what... (GRUNTS) - Well, then let's hit the road. Hi-5, you coming? I'm coming! Ugh! Why do I always think I'm gonna come around on black licorice? Aah! (GASPS) My precious. JAILBREAK: Hey! Move it! HI-5: Certain death, here we come. MEL: Let's try this one. MARY: YouTube? (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER SCREENS) (MUSIC PLAYING) MEL: Wow. What a visual treat. And I don't even need a remote. That guy is so expressive. MARY: He reminds me of Gene. Yeah. Something really wrong with him. - Mel. - Our son is a malfunction, and you should never have let him go into that cube. Don't blame me for this, Mel. I am hopping mad at you. See? Mary, I think we're being followed. But don't overreact. Uh-oh. I told you not to overreact. What are you doing now? They'll be in there for hours. BOTS: Aw! Aw! - Aw! - (MEOWING) Aw! Aw! Mary, where are you going? I think we should go our separate ways, Mel. I thought I knew the Meh that I married, but maybe I don't. But, Mary... JAILBREAK: This tunnel will help us avoid the Bots. GENE: Thanks for helping us. It's really nice of you. NBD, dude. The truth is, you're helping me. Come on, let's move it. Why so slow? Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close? What's with you? Back off. Can't stop now. I'm having a sugar rush! I'll go around you. If I stop moving, my heart's gonna explode! - Coming through, Jailbreak! Look out! - JAILBREAK: Hey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt! I can't feel my face. (LAUGHS) So, Jailbreak, back there you said I'm helping you. I've been trying to get past that firewall for months. (GIGGLES) Come on, come on! The faster we get there, the faster I become a favorite! (GIGGLING) (WHOOPS) Look at me! I just want to bounce out of here, get off the phone, and live on the cloud. Oh! Whoa. (SIGHS) (GIGGLES) Ow! What just happened? - (GRUNTING) - You don't like it here? There's so many rules here. What is up with that? The cloud is supposed to be amazing. There's so much to see and do. (GRUNTS) Uh-oh. Sugar crash. I can't hold on anymore. Catch me, Gene. Catch me! And you can be whoever you want. (HI-5 SCREAMING) - Thanks. - You're free! Come on!

(HI-5 LAUGHING) (GENE YELLING) (HI-5 GROANS) You know, come to think of it, I don't really remember there ever being a hacker emoji. Oh, um, you know, you're taking up too much of my brain space. Let's keep the chitchat to a minimum. - (SIGHS) - Ooh. - Someone likes you. - What are you talking about? This is just like when Peace Sign gave me just one finger. I knew she was in love with me. - JAILBREAK: Let's go! - (STOMACH GRUMBLES) I'm never eating another piece of candy ever again. Hi-5, don't do it. Don't you do it. It's already been in there once. Don't do it. Wow. - JAILBREAK: Move it! - Are my fingers getting fat? I'll tell you what, this bandage wasn't so tight before. Okay. We get through this app, and Dropbox is right on the other side. We just need to keep it super DL in here. And no matter what, we can't turn it on. (LOUD CLICK) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) OMG, this turned it on! What? I'm a hand. It's a big, red button. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) Whoa. - What's happening? - No, no, no, no, no! Welcome to Just Dance! Follow my moves and you get to move forward. Do the wrong moves and you get an "X." Three strikes and you're out. Out? What does she mean by "Out"? Digital death. Oh, thanks to you, Fingers. Now we're gonna have to dance our way out. Which is all right with me, 'cause I can shake it like Michael. Or Michael's glove, anyway. Are you ready to dance? This is bad, Gene. I can't dance. I got no groove. Come on. Everybody can dance. Not me, okay? I'm really stiff. See? I can't... (SIGHS) Don't understand. GENE: No. HI-5: Okay. No, no... - Hey, no, stop, stop. - Stop, stop. She has to stop. I see now what you are saying.

Wow. Okay. I'm sorry. This is my malfunction. I just... I can't be meh about anything. This is why I'm going to get reprogrammed. Well, it's actually kind of cool. Wait, really?
