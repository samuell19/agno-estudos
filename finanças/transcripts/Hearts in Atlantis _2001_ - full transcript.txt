Man: package for robert garfield? Yeah. Sign here. Thanks. Bobby: whenever it wants, The past can come kicking the door down. And...you never know where it's gonna take you. All you can do is hope it's a place you want to go. Bobby on machine: hi. You've reached the garfield family. Jill and the boys are away skiing. You can reach them on their various cell phones. Me, i'm gonna be on the road for a few days. Be back tuesday. On behalf of the president of the united states And the people of a grateful nation, I present this flag as a token of appreciation For the honorable and faithful service rendered By your husband, major john sullivan, Known as sully. Boy: hey, sully! Hey! Sully: bobby, i decided last night What i want to be when i grow up. What's that? A magician! I'll pull rabbits and shit out of a hat! Rabbits will probably shit in your hat. But i'd be a cool bastard. Come on, admit it. There's cake and coffee at the veterans' hall. Of course, you're all welcome. Mr. Garfield. Mr. Oliver. Hello. Hi. Thanks for sending the glove. Been sully's lawyer since forever. Couldn't for the life of me see why A baseball glove had to go through probate. You and sully were kids together? Yeah. There were 3 of us. Well, there was me and sully And there was a girl named carol. Carol gerber? That's right. Yeah. I'm hoping she'll be here. You didn't hear about carol? No. I'm afraid she's dead. I'm so sorry. Bobby: this street is where it all happened. It's not much now. Why do we always expect home will stay the same? Nothing else does. It's funny how when you're a kid A day can last forever. Now...all these years seemed just like a blink. Liz: bobby! Bobby-O! Time to get a wiggle on! Wake up, bobby! Girl: hey, wait for me! Come on, johnny! * you broke * * my heart * * when you said * * we'll part * * ain't that... * Happy birthday, mr. 11. Ta-Da! Oh, wow. A library card. A grown-Up's library card, if you please. Thanks, mom. It's... Just don't. Don't you think i wanted to get you a bike? I can't afford it. Do you know how that makes me feel? Your father didn't exactly leave us well off, you know. I'll tell you what he did leave us. He left us 3 months unpaid rent, A life insurance policy That lapsed the year before he died. He left a rather large stack of unpaid bills Which i have pretty well managed to take care of, Because people have been very understanding of our situation. Mr. Biderman at the office is a very good example, But it has not been easy. You get that? So, let me put it this way... Your father never met an inside straight he didn't like. What's an inside straight? Never you mind, bobby-O. Don't you ever let me catch you playing cards for money. Had enough of that to last me a lifetime. Come on, then! Hat must be the new tenant for the upstairs apartment. I don't trust people who move their things in paper bags. That's so slutty. Well, he has suitcases. Yes, but they don't match, do they? Oh, hello, folks. I'm ted brautigan. I'll be living upstairs for a while. Ma'am. How do you do? I'm elizabeth garfield and this is my son robert, And it's very nice to meet you, mr. Brattigan, But tempus fugit. It's brautigan, ma'am, But ted will be fine with me. Bobby: it's nice to meet you, mr. Brautigan. Go on now. I hope you'll like it here. Bobby! Thank you, robert. Yeah. Carol: birthday boy! Mwah! Carol, it's hard enough being friends Without you pulling stuff like that. You loved it. Here. Is this gonna be gushy? I don't know. Better not be. Oh. Just like it, huh? Yeah. That's great. Thanks. Sure. Didn't get the bike, did you? No big deal. Mom can't afford it. She buys her new dresses, though. She has to look nice for the office, doesn't she? Are you coming? Yeah! Come on! Stop! Stop! * come on, baby * Hey, sully! Hey! * doo wop wop * * come on, baby * Did you get the bike? No. Well, i got nothin' for you, But happy birthday anyway, you bastard! * and go like this * * ee-Oh, twist * Come on! * baby, twist * Hang on! Wait for me! * ooh, yeah * * just like this * * round and round * * come on, little miss * * and do the twist * * my daddy is sleepin' * * and mama ain't around * * yeah * * and mama ain't around * * we're gonna twist and twist and twist * What's an inside straight? Something to do with gambling, isn't it? Poker. You try to draw a card in the middle. It's dumb. Strictly for suckers. Heh heh. * ooh, yeah * * just like this * This neighborhood is gettin' terribly run down. Bugs: i think i'll have to move. Yeah? Liz: oh, is that how we answer the phone? Oh, hi, mom. I'm sorry. I was just excited about dinner and all. Well, bobby, mr. Biderman is swamped And has to work late And needs me to do the same, So birthday dinner at the colony is off. Bobby: oh. Ok, mom. There are leftovers in the fridge And i'll be home to tuck you in. Oh, and, bobby, make sure to turn off the gas ring When you're done with the stove, all righty? I know. See you soon. Evening, robert. Hmm? Or should i say bobby? Oh, mr. Brautigan. Hi. It's ted. Sorry. Ted'll be hard for me, but i'll try. You going out later? Oh. I was supposed to have a birthday dinner with my mom, But she had to stay at work. Even though she didn't want to. Are you a rich man, then? From your birthday gifts. Oh. Just a library card? An adult library card. Oh, my. All the master storytellers Of the world just waiting for you. You know why she picked it? Because it was free. Ah, that doesn't matter. Don't you give up on this card, bobby, 'Cause books can be solid gold. The great ones have been getting us Through the nights for centuries now. Just give a writer an hour or two to hook you And if he can't, Wish him the best and find someone else. Think you can try that? Well, if you don't have anything else to do... Well, fair enough. Don't be afraid. A tale of two cities ends with a beheading, All kinds of great stuff. Lost horizon... magic in places unknown. Can't beat that. Where'd you live before you came here, mr...ted? Some other place that wasn't as nice as this. You, bobby, you lived here long? Yes, sir. Since my dad died. Ah. When was that sad day? When i was 5. 6 years, huh? I bet you know everything that happens on this street. Sure do... Because nothing happens on this street. Oh. 6 years. Ah, that's just a blink. Some day you'll agree. You know, ben jonson called time "the old bald cheater." What? Ben jonson called time the "old bald cheater." I like that. I think i do, too. Who's ben jonson? He was an english writer. Dead these many years. Brilliant, but foolish about money. And...given to flatulence. What's flatulence? Yeah. Kids always think farts are funny. Might have a job for you later. Have to think about it first, though. Really? Yeah. If it works out, you might get that bike. How'd you know i wanted a bike? All kids want bikes. * only you * * can make this world seem right * * only you * * can make * * the darkness bright * Hey, mom, i took another look at that bike. Mm-Hmm? It's a phantom, 26-Incher, Real swell. No, perfect. Perfect is more like it. Well, start saving those pennies. Ted? It's me. Hi, kiddo. Come in. Thanks for making the skyward journey. An icy root beer awaits you as a reward. Colder the better. One feels them first at the back of one's eyes. Feels what? One feels them first at the back of one's eyes. Yeah. Hey, i did like you said. What? I gave him a couple of hours. Oh, yeah. Lost horizon. What do you think? Better than the hardy boys. Yeah, sure is. Tell me, bobby... How would you like to make a dollar a week? Would i ever! Well, the truth is, My eyes are beginning to fail me, And if you will read me the harwich journal every day, Headline stuff, sports, comics, want ads, I'll give you said dollar. What do you say, kiddo? What else? What do you mean? There's got to be more to it than that. Yeah, there is. So what's the real job? I want you to keep your eyes open, that's all. For what? Low men. That's right, bobby. I use the term "low" in the dickensian sense, Meaning "dangerous"... fellows who are ruthless And stop at nothing to get what they want. Your real job will simply be to... Walk around the area... And if you see them Or find evidence that they've been here, You will alert me immediately, ok? Ok. And why are they hot on your trail? A certain something i happen to have. Let's leave it at that. So what do they look like? Hmm? Well, they wear dark clothes, dark hats. They're kind of anonymous, But you can recognize them by the cars they drive... Loud and flashy. When they move, they move in packs, Like animals closing in on the kill. And, uh... They cast long shadows. Ah, what a world. They're not cops, are they? Or secret agents? Are you asking if i'm a bad guy Or a commie spy? It's true, i've scamped my share of fines, And if there were library police, I'd be one of their "ten most wanted," But, no, i never robbed a bank Or stole a military secret. So who are they? Hmm? They're thugs, bullies, call them what you will. They're bulldogs. Relentless when they're after something. Like this something you have? That's right. And what they want is me back under their control. So you be on the lookout for them, Because when they're closing in, They leave strange signs in code In obvious places like telephone poles... Posters and notices for lost pets and lost dogs. Now, if i knew what they might do, They'd never catch me, but i don't. What do i do if i see them? Run like hell was after you and tell me what you've seen. You remember when we met a week ago And i asked you if you knew what was going on around here? Sure. That's why you're my man, kiddo. Don't worry, ted. I won't let the bogeymen get you. Liz: bobby? Are you up there? Don't worry. She can't possibly know what you're thinking. You think she can and that's her power over you. That's a mother's power. Mrs. Garfield. Well, it's very cozy in here. Oh, mom, ted... i mean, mr. Brautigan, He's gonna pay me a dollar a week Just to read him the papers every day. Well, that's very generous. Do you always have young boys Read you the papers, mr. Brattigan? It's brautigan, ma'am, And, yes, i need someone to do it. My eyes aren't what they used to be since i retired. And what did you do before that? I worked up north. Various places. Well, come along, bobby. Time and tide wait for no man. Bye, mr. Brautigan. Bobby. Mom, guess what mr. Brautigan... Shh, shh, shh. Ok. Something doesn't make sense to me. What? Why would a man his age Want to spend that much time with a kid? I don't know... But what i do know is that he said I must be some lucky kid to have a mom Who would actually let me have A grown-Up library card for my birthday. I don't know. I trust him about as far As i could sling a piano. That's right. Spoil it for me. You just never want me to get that bike. I do...i do, and i wish i could have Gotten it for you myself, But your father didn't exactly leave us Well off, you know. It's only reading. All right. What's the harm? Yes, yes, yes, yes. But only on the porch, mind, in the fresh air. Ok. * if you can use * * some exotic booze * * there's a bar in far bombay * * come fly with me * * let's fly, let's fly away * * come fly with me * * let's float down to peru * Bye, bobby. Bye, carol. * in llama land... * Sorry, i'm late, ted. I forgot the time. That's all right. We're all time's captives, Hostages to eternity. Ben jonson? No. Boris pasternak. He was a russian... Of no account, i think. So what's going on in the big, wide world? Something scurrilous, i suppose. "Vice president richard m. Nixon, "After having won the republican nomination "For president on the first ballot, Confers with henry cabot lodge"... Carol: we're goin' for some ice cream. You want to come? Can't. Earning my daily bread. Afternoon, mrs. Gerber, carol. Hi, ted. I never ever saw A girl as special as carol gerber. There's millions. Oh, yeah? Have you kissed her yet? Yuck. Well, you will. I promise you. Stay away. Ha. You will, And it will be the kiss By which all others in your life will be judged... And found wanting. Are you done? Yeah. Come on, read to me. Go on. Come back here and do your job. Ok. But you will kiss her. Carol: come on. Nice goin'. Get in, please. Bobby: here! Gimme it! Come on. Please? Come on, sully. Carol: sully. Bobby: "f.B.I. Announces new measures To combat red infiltrators." Hmph. Hey, bobby. Yeah. When you get to flash gordon, Be sure and tell me what dale arden's wearing. What is it with you and her? Well, if you must know, when i was younger I thought she was a real hotsy-Totsy. Ok, before comics, we've got sports... Baseball. Mmph. "Maury wills on the way to break ty cobb's record." I saw cobb. My dad saw babe ruth. He saw him point for the home run... Oh. Against the cubs. He told me all about it. He tell you of nagurski's comeback game? I know he saw it, though. Were you there? Yeah. You and my dad were at the same place. You know about bronko nagurski, huh? He was my dad's hero, that's all. The greatest football player that ever lived. After college, he came to chicago, Played 8 years for the bears, Made them champions, Then he retired. When he was old, 6 years retired, The bears brought him back as a substitute. Last game of the season, They were playing the crosstown cardinals... Sworn enemies. The bears had to beat the cardinals To win the championship. Nagurski wasn't supposed to play, Third-String fullback. Then in the first half, the starter went down. The second half, there was a pile-Up. Oh, no. If your dad was here telling you this, He would have said he was frightened, bobby. He was just so scared. But why? Nagurski was in the game. I was scared, too. We all were. So we wanted a miracle, you see, bobby. We...we wanted him the way he was, The old bronko nagurski. We wanted him the way he used to be Back in the old days. Did he do good, ted? 'Cause i don't want to hear this if he didn't. Well, the quarterback gave him the ball, And nagurski ran slowly up to the line, And the cardinals crushed him, But somehow... Somehow he gained a few yards. Next play, the same. Same thing play after that. They just kept giving the ball to the old man, And the bears began to move down the field, 5 yards, 10 yards... 7 more. If he just could score for us, we could win. We could be champions again. Go on, ted. You can't stop. Huh. Ted. Come on. I've gotta know what happened. Come on. You know what your dad did right then, bobby? No, no, no. Yeah. What did my father do? He jumped to his feet. He was screaming. We all were because we couldn't believe What was happening on the field. Oh, my god, what was it? Go on. It was our miracle, you see... Because he was crawling. Bronko nagurski was crawling toward the goal line, And they just piled everything on him, Did everything they could to stop him. But nothing could stop him. Yeah, that's right, bobby, Not on that day, Not when your dad and i saw the miracle, When the old man brought us home. He scored. He scored for us. Crowd: nagurski! Nagurski! We were champions again. I just knew he would. Yeah, then he was gone again, Back to the north where he came from. Bronko nagurski. Liz: bobby! Bobby-O! Ted. Yeah. Well, i know the low men don't exist, But if a bunch of 'em Started driving around here And the strange signs started appearing On the telephone poles... Well, we both know that couldn't happen, But if it did... Would you have to go away? Yeah. It wouldn't be safe for me here, kiddo, And wishing cannot make it so. Liz: bobby! Bobby, this ted of yours... Did he tell you where he came from? Eh. Some place not as nice as here I think he said. Ah. Well, that doesn't tell us much, does it? Mmm. Anything else? Nope. Bobby... Hmm? Does he... What? Nothing. Just promise me you'll tell me If anything unusual happens, all right? Hello? Hi. You promised. I really need the... Who was that? Nothing, honey. It's just a wrong number. Liz: son of a bitch. I know it's you, bobby. Your mom says she's almost ready. Great! You think ted would like to come? To the fair? Don't you think he'd like to be asked? I guess. You do it. I'll go get sully. Ok. Hey, how do you like being beaten by a girl? Hey, no fair. Mr. Biderman needs me to come in. On a saturday? Well, some people have to work for their money. Mom. What? You promised. Oh, honey. These are just kools, bobby-O. Read the advertising. Kools. They cool the throat. They're hardly even cigarettes at all. Mom? What? Could i please have a little money For the rides and stuff? Ohh, you never stop, do you? Honey, aren't you earning your own money now? Yeah, but that's for the bike. Well, if you want to spend it Riding the loop-De-Loop with your little girlfriend That's your business. Ted, it's me. You want to come to the fair? Ted? Is everything ok? Ted, wake up. Ted, you've gotta help me. Ted, i don't know what to do. They draw west now. Who? Jesus, ted, please. They draw west now, but they may be back. Ted, please, you can't die on me. Please. Aah! Oh, my god. What just happened? I went off again, didn't i? You mean like at the fridge? Yeah. No. Way worse. I thought you were having a fit Or something. No, it's all right, bobby. But if it happens again, It's best you didn't touch me. Nobody should touch me, that's all. Sorry. Is it safe to leave you alone? Yeah. It's ok. Ok. Um, mrs. Gerber's taking us to the fair. Carol and i thought you might like to come. Thank you, bobby, but i think just now, Um, it's not wise. The cigarettes are on the table. Thanks, kiddo. What's so funny? You run along now. Enjoy yourself. Don't fall out of anything. * oh, carol * * don't let him steal your heart away * * i'm gonna learn to dance * * if it takes me all night and day * * climb into my machine so we can cruise on out * * i know a swingin' little joint * * where we can jump and shout * * it's not too far back off the highway * * not too far of a ride * No!

Ok, gang, that's enough. Hey, bobby was right. Dealer: a prodigy walks amongst us. Hey, why don't you win everybody Their money back? Uh, you know, i could, But i'm not supposed to play cards For money, so... A boasty boy. He says he can win, but he's too afraid To back up his boast. Bobby, i could have my money back. Come on. Beat him for me. Uh... come on! Mrs. Gerber: i don't think I can let you do this, sweetie. Your mother would not be happy. My mom's never happy. Ok. It's all i got.

That way everybody can go home happy. Fine. This next one is 5 years of my life. This one here. Nobody ever beat that shuffle. Well, mister, is it or isn't it? Yes! That's the one.

It's easy as can beezy. Easy-Peezy-Japaneezy! Bobby: yes, yes, yes! Don't be afraid. When we swung out, i-I was afraid We were coming loose and falling to our doom. We're as safe as can be. What do you think you're doing? Well, i thought you wanted me to. I just wasn't ready, that's all. Ok. Bobby, do it again. I-I better not. You'll tell. Ah, no, it'll be our secret. Hurry, before we go down. Bobby, i'm dying here. Thank you, bobby. That was just the nicest thing. And it'll be the kiss by which all others In our life will be judged. What? I don't know. Sounded better when ted said it. Carol: you knew, didn't you? Where the queen of hearts was? Bobby: yeah. It was like i could tell everything That was going on in his head. So, every thought he had, i knew it, And he couldn't fool me. Can you tell what's going on In sully's head? Nah, sully's head is always empty. Oh yeah? Maybe i'm thinking of... Getting a new glove for next year. You are? Well...well, what about that one? You really want it? Are you kidding? I love that glove! Then, bobby garfield, it is yours. I'll leave it to you in my will. Sully, you just love doing that. I got you again. Bobby: wait, no, no, no, no! You know, when you're young, You have moments of such happiness. You think you're living in someplace magical, Like atlantis must have been. Bobby: oh, hey, carol, I owe you $75 and it's your turn. Ok. Here, give me 25 back. 25? Ted: then we grow up... And our hearts break in two. Come on. Hang on. What is it? I wonder what it means, don't you? It means somebody Lost their pet, goofball. Come on. Well, yeah, but maybe It's a secret code for something. A secret code? What are you talking about? Harry: hey, fairy! I'll take that! I'm not a fairy! Don't talk to them! How are your tits coming, gerber baby? Carol: go away! Whoo-Hoo! Bobby: shut up, harry doolin! Lone ranger: hi yo, silver! Liz: bobby-O, how was school? Good. You will never guess. Don...mr.

Bobby, i've wanted to be an agent for so long. This is a big chance for me. Great. When is it? Friday afternoon. Now, it's just for 2 nights. Now, i can't have you staying At your little girlfriend's house. She's not my girlfriend. Whatever.

Just my rotten luck. Bobby, why don't you ask your friend To come down for a nice cup of tea? Ok. I'm sorry, mrs. Garfield, But, uh, no. I-I wouldn't be much Of a baby-Sitter for bobby. But i've never been invited To a real seminar before. You could sleep on the pull-Out couch, Which is oh, so comfortable, And you two could go to the diner, And then maybe even take in a movie. Well, i'll tell you what. If bobby wants me to, i will. Liz: bobby? Well, how come you get to have all the fun? Liz: don't you want me to better myself? Yeah, but what about me?

Woman: did you see those eyes? They're so scary. Oh, i know. Bobby: what do we do now? Ted: had enough to eat? Are you kidding, after those hot dogs? What do they call this part of town? I've heard it referred to as "down there." You see, every city has a place where... Your last name doesn't matter And wine comes in a paper sack, and, uh... You can buy almost anything you want If you've got cash in your pocket, that is. Hey, come on. Stay close now. Don't worry about that.

You know...it's like on mondays, it was just dead in here, And in no time flat, we were all laughing. Not a mean bone in his body. He was generous, too. Not too many like that in here. He'd never buy a drunk a drink. You know, i admired that. Yeah, and he also never met an inside straight That he didn't like. Who told you that? Now, i remember the big losers. And most nights, he walked out of here With a little bit more than he came in with. He was a hell of a card player, bobby was. Keep that if you want. He's handsome, don't you think? You got that to look forward to. You got a girlfriend? Yes, ma'am. Pretty? Yes, ma'am. Her name's carol. She's a real hotsy-Totsy. Ha ha ha! A what? Let's go, partner. Taxi's waiting. Ted, listen, my dad came here. Yeah? And he didn't lose all our money And he was generous and he was funny And people liked him. Good. Isn't that a thing? Yeah. Lucky for us we came in here, i'd say. Yes, it is a wonderful thing. So how much did you bet? All i've got...$200 on albini. You think albini can beat hollywood hayward? Yeah, i think he can knock him out. I bet on him. 10-1 odds.

I'm proud of you. I'm sorry i didn't believe you about the low men. I know. Ted...my father never bought a drunk a drink. What does that mean exactly? It means he was a good man, he was honest, And he never added to the troubles of the world, ok? Good night. Announcer: and there's the bell. Hollywood hayward coming out throwing punches, Literally running in. He's now attacking albini at will. Albini, arms hanging to his body like weights, Occasionally throwing a weak punch. The punches are flying. It's a flurry. Oh, hollywood is just... oh, my goodness! Out of nowhere, a right punch by albini Has taken hollywood hayward to the head and to the mat! They're counting him out... 8, 9, 10. Oh, my goodness. One of the most improbable Finishes to a fight i have ever seen! Albini has beaten hollywood hayward! This one has got to be reviewed. Albini...

But i'm trying not to be too sad about it. Oh, good. Now don't forget to brush your teeth. I did it already. Good boy. Well, i can't be chatting all night. There's a cocktail party for all of us delegates Downstairs in the ballroom, and i don't... Let me see what i can do... Are you still there? I dropped the silly phone. I love you, bobby. Don... Do you realize i'd be giving up Everything i ever worked for? That's funny. Got cut off. That 2,000... It's traveling money, isn't it? Yeah, it is. I lied to you, ted. I didn't tell you about the "lost pet" sign i saw. I know. When will you leave? Tomorrow night, when your mother gets back. Collect my winnings from len files At the corner pocket and go. Will i ever see you again? No. And wishing can't make it so. I don't want you to go. It's all for the best, kiddo. It's all for the best. "In yet another startling development "In washington, "J. Edgar hoover, "The director of the federal bureau of investigation, "Today issued a statement denying that bureau "Was involved in recruiting psychics In the battle against communism." That's really what all this is about, isn't it, ted? Want a root beer? That's the only good thing about you going... I can't stand that stuff. Heh. Yeah, i know. Do you know everything? Nope. So what happens when you touch people? Oh, i pass on a kind of window Into other people's minds. Is that why they want you, this window? Yeah. I know certain things, see certain things. Some think of it as a gift, but to me, It's always been a burden. What i see has a value for some. Maybe i escaped them this time. Thanks. Cheers. Your good health. Ah! Ah, well. We're all just passing through, kiddo. Just passing through, that's all. Tell carol i'd like to say good-Bye to her, too. Sure. Hey, bobby! Yeah? I think you should go and find her now. Ok. Hey, bobby. Um, is carol home? No, she went down to the ravine To read her book by that tree. You don't scare me, bobby garfield. Well... If it isn't the gerber baby. Aah! No! Please! Aah! Harry? Unhh! Shh. No! Ohh! Carol: aah! Don't! Bobby: carol. Carol! Bobby: carol! Carol! Is everything ok? He hit me, bobby! He hit me hard. It's ok. I'll go get help, ok? No, please! Don't leave me alone. He might come back. It'll be ok. Can you walk? I don't know. Just try, ok? Maybe. We'll try. Ohhh! It'll be ok. It's ok. Here, try and stand up, ok? Here, can you stand up? Ok, carol, here's what you have to do. You have to get on my back, ok? Bobby, i can't! Yes, you can. Yes, you can. You can. You...you have to think about something else, ok? Here, get on my back. Remember at school When we were playing piggyback during recess? Yes. This is just like that, ok? Unhh. Come on. Ted: bronko nagurski. Nagurski. Bobby: 10 yards... 7 yards... Bobby: nothing could stop him. Ted! Ted, help. I think her right arm is broken. Come on, carol. It's all right. Open the door. It's all right. It's all right. Ow, my arm! It's all right. Bobby, you take her hand, all right? Oh, yeah. One great big boy against one little girl. He was probably so afraid of you. Probably thought you had the heart of a lion. He hurt me, ted. I know. Believe me, i know. Now listen, carol. I've got to look at your shoulder, understand? Don't want to hurt you. You're gonna be fine. Oh, my. He broke my arm. I don't think it's broken. I think it's just dislocated. And i think i can fix it. Are you a doctor, ted? No, i'm not a doctor. But as you noted, i'm very strange. So who knows what i can do. Do you have the heart of a lion? All right. Just close your eyes and try to relax. Bobby, give me your belt. Now, carol, do you know what pain does? Carol: hmm? It rises. It travels up the body. That's it. Thank you. Now, listen to me, carol. Just listen and relax. I want you to bite down hard on bobby's belt. You're going to bite down on bobby's belt And catch the pain. Now, relax. Close your eyes. Keep them closed. You're safe. Just breathe in. Breathe out, that's it. There's no pain. Just listen to my voice. I can sense them closing in on me, bobby. I know. There's signs everywhere. Here we go. Bite down hard and catch the... Here we go. Shh. All right. There. Ted? Yeah? It doesn't hurt anymore. You do have the heart of a lion. Thank you. You did well, kiddo. Liz: what the hell is going on in here? Bobby: oh, mom, look what happened to you. God! Take your hands off that little girl, you bastard! Mom! He didn't do anything bad! How dare you touch her? You son of a bitch! Mom, no! He didn't hurt her! I found her in the park, and i brought her here So that ted could help her! Go to your room! And you! You filthy old man. You are going to jail! What happened to you was terrible. It didn't happen to her, though. Why is her blouse open? So he could fix her shoulder! I told you to go to your room! Carol: what bobby said was true! Let's go in the bathroom and get you cleaned up. He carried me up the hill. Ted took my pain away. Don't you touch her! Go in the bathroom. I'll be there in a second. I'm calling the police, And i'm telling them everything i just saw. Why don't you tell them what happened to you? You weren't there. You couldn't know. I...i know. I know you didn't realize the seminar Was going to involve liquor and sex. And i know your son is growing up While your mind is on other things. I'm going to take that child home, And you better not be here when i get back. Be careful, ted. I'll be fine, don't worry. Where will you go till it's dark? Ah, to the diner Near the corner pocket, i guess. Pick up my winnings later. I want to go with you. Bobby, come inside, please. Do as she says, kiddo. Liz: ah, yes, is this, uh, housitonic 5-8-3-7?

See how great it worked out, Turning him in? I did...i did it for you. It was for your own good. You lie! You always lie. My father was a good man, And people liked him. Everyone liked him except you. You never liked me, either. And then i find a friend, A grown-Up friend of my own, And you know what? I loved him. You didn't just betray him. You betrayed both of us.
