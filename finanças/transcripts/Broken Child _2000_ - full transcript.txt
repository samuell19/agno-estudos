Where is she at? I'll call you back later. Come on. A hot August afternoon in Houston, Texas. Child protection services and city police respond to a report... of neglected children. Child Protection is the government agency whose job... it is to protect children from abuse or neglect. This is not her saying that she's giving us permission. This is just letting you know... that we're taking custody of the children today. The children have been left alone for three days. They are dirty and infested with lice. The house is full of dog feces... and has no electricity or running water. Where is he going? The authorities decide to take custody of the children. There are eight in all. This is the moment of their permanent separation from their mother. Okay let's have the bigger ones. Get in. Yeah I guess we could take the bigger ones. Okay. Every year in the United States... nearly one in twenty-five children are reported to... suffer abuse or neglect. Child Protection agencies are being overwhelmed by the crisis. Later that afternoon... a battered child arrives at a hospital trauma center. He's nearly dead. The number of children seriously injured... from child abuse has quadrupled in seven years. The child sustained the following injuries... a multiple skull fracture, dental damage... a concussion and brain damage. There was internal bleeding and an open wound on his face. His right eye was black and swollen shut. The child also suffered a stroke a cerebral infarction. The child was unconscious upon admission... and required vigorous support... including dopamine to increase blood pressure. Did the agency find out later from the mother... how long she was actually gone? Yes Ms. Sanchez, later said that she was gone... approximately three hours. Because she had gone to purchase some drugs and had used. Child protection wants custody of the battered child. But first they must get approval from a judge. The mother left her son with a stranger. When she returned... she found her child nearly beaten to death. Who was the man whose home that you went to that did the beating? I didn't know him. I'd just met him the night before. Alright. And how did you meet him? From him. Well there I was walking on the street and they stopped... to ask me if I wanted to do something for money and I did. Talking about your trouble with the law... Nearly four out of five of these custody cases... are linked to drugs or alcohol. During the last year what kind of drug usage have you done? The last year I just did crack this year... - for four days. - You used crack... on what kind of basis? I did it all day and night. Where would you get the a money... - to buy the crack? - I'd sell myself. - And I'd steal. - What do you mean by that? My body, I would help... - I'd tell people that... - Would you prostitute yourself? Is that right? The court took custody of the child... but allowed the mother occasional visitations. This is his injury right there. - What happened? - He's had that. I guess that's... where they hit, the man hit him. - Hit him with what? - The stick. I'm sure he got upset with him and he came and... coz he probably cried, coz I wasn't there. And then this year... is where they put the shunt in for the fluid that is draining. This is the shunt right here. And it goes to here. The child's placed in foster care... but just before his third birthday... he died. His death certificate said he died of injuries... related to his abuse. An investigator from Child Protection has gotten... a call about two young brothers who may be in danger. The family is already known to the agency. Each of the boys has been taken away before. The investigator reads the report to her mother... and her boyfriend. Yesterday was Billy was foundalone in the apartment. The apartment door was unlocked. He was extremely dirty, so dirty he looked like... he had been dipped in mud. The child was soaking on an empty bottle... that had slime in it. He had diaper rash that is bleeding... and a fully nasty diaper. - He was left unattended... - Children's emotional development... can be seriously affected by neglect. They may never fully develop the ability... to feel empathy for other people. And may become indifferent to the feelings and welfare of others. The apartment also smelled of sour milk... dirty diapers, trash and dirty dish water... that had been in the sink for some time. I staff with my supervisor... and would like to know if there's a relative available... that maybe you could place the children with for... a couple of days while you clean the house up. The children's mother has a history of mental illness... which began in her own childhood. She grew up in a home troubled by domestic violence and alcoholism. Investigators are worried about her fitness as a mother. They want to remove my babies from me. And I don't think. They said my apartment's unsanitary for kids. A relative will take her children, but only for a while. The situation is made worse because she is pregnant. And has stopped taking her medication which controls her mental illness. Please, thank you. Here she is. They'll take them for me. This is Kathy Ford and I'm with Children's Protective Services. It is a familiar story. Well known to child protection workers. A hurt child became a damaged adult... who is hurting her children. Generation to generation... the cycle is passed on. Early trauma can shape an entire life. By the time children are four years old... psychologists can tell which of them are likely to drop out of school... or become delinquent. Almost always, they are abused or neglected children... who've been exposed to violence. It is the story of many of these young criminals. A life history that has left them emotionally disturbed. And there is evidence that some of them may suffer from brain damage. Making them even more prone to acts of violence and crime. In this laboratory... researchers have found that the brains of impulsive and... violent criminals are abnormal in almost identical ways. And the stories they tell about growing up... have striking similarities. As a young child... this prisoner was beaten on his head for punishment. He was neglected and emotionally abused. In school he struggled with learning disabilities... and an uncontrollable temper. Finally, he joined a gang and the violence of the street. The tormented child who was a victim... has become a danger to society. A small rundown motel south of Seattle. It is a home to thieves, drug dealers and prostitutes. And for some weeks now, it has been Patricia's home. The manager lets you smoke crack, sell crack, sell pussy... prostitution, whatever you like. Know what I'm saying? As long as you pay him. Kind of looks the other way, does he? Yeah... And I'm so glad I'm in this house than... any of those other mother fuckers. okay? - When I said If I... - Patricia stays at this motel... because the rent is negotiable. She can pay when she has the money... by the day or by the week. It depends on how good her business is. Patricia has been working as a prostitute for fifteen years. And right now she's eight months pregnant. - Oh damn, what's going on here? - Reverse. This motherfucking lighter work great. It's like me and every time I started going it's like... you go like this far. Fuck man. What's really going on with this shit? For most of her career as a prostitute... Patricia s been addicted to crack cocaine. She's been smoking crack during most of her pregnancy. Sometimes for days at a time without stopping to sleep. Her drug abuse may be damaging her baby's brain... before it is even born. This motherfucker here is starting to really just piss me off. Cuz this motherfucking lighter here is just totally, totally fucked. The motel sits by a busy highway in an area that's well-known for prostitution. Patricia is nervous about the police. She's been arrested and jailed many times and... has warrants out for her arrest. And then the po po was out. Just dramatically. Okay? Police everywhere, stopping everyone, everybody. Kent and Des Moines was out here, last night. Boy... It was wild, put it that way. It was just real wild. Working yesterday? Yeah I worked the street yesterday... a couple times. What did you do specifically? Oh I would say blow jobs. How much money did you make? Seventy bucks. Or more than that I think, a hundred and something. And in, in between working you were smoking crack? - Yeah. - Been up for? Three days. Three long days. I'm tired. I gotta go. I have to lay down. I'm tired. Is it harder to do all this when you re pregnant? Oh yeah, I mean my back is killing me right now. I need to lay down. I'm serious, I need to lay down. Whatever it is... I hope... for her benefit, for her sake, for her benefit, for real. Something like this is junk, I'm telling you. I mean I'm not playing. - I stopped. - Tell me about it. Motherfucking men, those sorry ass brothers out there. So what makes you think I ain't going to get that bitches ass? Alicia is Patricia's business and drug partner. She is also a prostitute and helps Patricia buy and sell... drugs to supply their crack habit. Alicia has a long criminal history. And like Patricia, she is also pregnant. I'm a robber. Went to prison for first degree armed robbery with a deadly weapon. Assault in the second degree. Got out. Went right back for parole violation. Got out. Fucked up again and then went right back for another... probation violation. Got out. Stayed out for awhile, went back home to North Dakota. Was out for about three year in North Dakota. Came back to Seattle. Wasn't even here for a couple weeks. Fucked up again, who cares? Shot somebody. Um, he deserved it and he should've died. And I really don't care. And I went to prison. And then about in three-and-a-half years got out. I've just been out since April. Alicia's been on the street since she was very young. When she was ten years old... she witnessed the murder of her father. At thirteen, she's into prostitution. Throughout her adult life... Alicia has had serious psychological problems. Sometimes I've felt like I really wanted to die. Sometimes I really have tried to do it. These are marks that I've used from... coming from razor blades. I had ten stitches in this one. Eight in this one, and thirteen in this one. I really must have something wrong with me... for me to go out here and... do the things that I've been doing, about what I'm doing now. For what? Ain't got shit. But I still do it. That's what the fuck's confusing. Why? And I really couldn't answer. You know? Later that day... a friend stopped by to visit with Patricia. Oh I felt something there. Oh yeah, you'll feel all kinds of shit. Well my daughter was my easiest labor. My daughter was... an hour-and-a half labor. One push and she flew out. - Oh my gosh, don't you just... - And my a two boys were C-sections. I had one caesarian. - All the rest... - Yep. No this is my sixth. - Your sixth? - Yeah. Oh my God, no. It's a big boy. Patricia's other children were taken away by Child Protection. And if this baby tests positive for drugs... it will be taken too. Patricia knows she's putting the health of her unborn baby at risk. It's not good. It's not good. - Are there... - It s not healthy. Would you rather not think about it or... I don't wanna think about it because see when... That's why I smoke crack cuz I a lot of things... I don't wanna deal with... in reality so I don't, I just... smoke crack to forget about it. And the health of your unborn child? It's terrible. You know? It's really terrible. I mean I thank God... for blessing me and I just pray that he'll bless me on this one too. Did you hear mom calling you? That's why you didn't play in the tub. Did you see Jon, a mom... At a home in the suburbs of Atlanta... it's bedtime for Jonathan. His parents have been trying to coax him into the bathtub... but he's steadily refused. Okay. Tonight is like many other nights. Come on. - Before something goes wrong. - Damn it. I'll give it to him. - I got ya. - Okay. Okay. Allison and Randy must control their son until his tantrum subsides. When Jonathan's in a tantrum or he's in a severe rage... the number one priority that we have... is protecting him... from... harm and protections ourselves... from him. Jonathan's hurt me badly enough... that I've had to get medical attention. He's biting to cause you pain. He's scratching to draw blood. He's hitting you to hurt you. There you go. Day, okay, Daddy will hold your feet, okay? Alright. Randy takes care of the cooking and chores. Caring for Jonathan is mostly up to Allison. That's the only tooth brush I have for you. Here honey, put toothpaste on it. Here you go. You gonna do it? Okay, come on. Is he like this every night? He, yep. Every night I'm wiping the teeth... which is why they're turning yellow. When he was nine months old... Child Protection took Jonathan away from... his biological mother and placed him in... foster care where he lived with many different families. Allison and Randy first took him as a foster child... then decided to adopt. Jonathan clearly had problems... but no one understood how badly he'd been damaged. We thought as new parents... and especially to have a special child... that it was something we were doing wrong. No one else was having these problems we were having. And as we kept investigating we found out everybody was. Aaahh go. Jonathan. Don't. Soon after Jonathan came to stay with Allison and Randy... his behavior became unmanageable. That's when they took these home videos to show therapists. Records show... that in the first months of Jonathan life he was badly neglected. And was taken from his mother by Child Protection. Then Jonathan lived in many different foster homes... and may have been abused in one of them. No way. But Jonathan's greatest injury came before he was even born. His biological mother was a drug user... and an alcoholic... and her drinking damaged his brain when he was in her womb. She was drunk when she gave birth. Jonathan was born with fetal alcohol syndrome... which has severely affected his behavior... and development. Are you ready for your medicine? Jonathan is now eight years old. During the years he's been with Allison and Randy... he's learned to express affection, something he couldn't do before. I love you too baby. Mornings are usually a good time for Jonathan... but his mood could change at any moment. What are giving him? Depacote. Ritalin. Clonadine and Melaril. Without it he couldn't go through daily functions at all. Oh no I mean if I have to draw it if I fax you the drawing... If I fax the card could you... a keep, I mean just, just the prices for me. Jonathan. - Is ready. - That's my phone, not a gun. You butt curt. - Put your foot down. - Jonathan takes six different... psychiatric medications... which help him think more clearly and control his behavior. But no combination of drugs has ever worked completely. Jonathan is always volatile and has a history... of self-mutilation and threatened suicide. His unpredictability is one of the family's biggest problems. Jonathan. Child care for Jonathan is almost impossible to find... because no one is equipped to handle the severity of his tantrums. Allison must take him with her every where she goes. Come on. Come on. Okay. It's alright. Okay. Alright? Get out of the way. Get out of the way. It's alright. Calm down. Are you ready to go home? You hot? Are you hot? Yeah? Okay. We've had worse visits where they've... asked us to leave. And we've been asked, you know... or they've walked around with us to make sure we could... finish our shopping. I'm talking. And I don't even think... I don't even think I got what was on my list. Jonathan's volatile behavior is not... the only symptom of his abnormally functioning brain. He doesn't fell pain like you or I would... like most people do. Jonathan was in school watching a movie or... listening to a story at school and he just reached right up... and yanked out his permanent front tooth. He reached up... and just as easily as... he could pulled... his tooth out just like that. There was no struggle. He just grabbed hold of it and pulled it out. Had the root all the way attached to it. It was just gushing blood. Stay over by the wall alright. Okay buddy. What you got? Dr. Grisham is Jonathan's therapist. He visits each week at Jonathan's school which specializes... in emotionally and behaviorally disturbed children. We want the pen back in this back when we finish, right? Jonathan has learning disabilities especially with language. But many of his skills are fairly normal. That was a good swing. That wasn't good enough. Jonathan's higher level brain functions... have been affected by his mother's drinking. Jonathan simply doesn't have what I call the brakes... and the planning ability. He lives in the moment. If he wants to do something he does it and he... the consequences of his behavior, he has difficulty learning from it. If something bad happens when he does something... the next time he can't think about that and say oh yeah that... that happened last time, I'm not gonna do that this time. - Nice one. - He is definitely at risk... especially when he hits adolescence of... becoming incarcerated for... his poor impulse control and violent behavior. That was good. It's amazing the range of his behaviors. When he's in a good mood and he's doing well... he can be very caring, very gentle... just a wonderful loving kid. And then at other times you see him and he... he's not, he would... hurt virtually anybody. I mean he's in a rage. He wants to hurt. He does want to hurt. And to see that range of behaviors... to him it must feel like he's two different people in some ways. He looks just like all the other kids. You know it doesn't look like there's anything wrong with him. And that's something that... I've battled with for years... almost wishing sometimes that... he looked like he had something wrong with him. Cuz then it'd almost be... an explanation to the public or an explanation to other people... when he acted up and we had a tantrum... when he'd scream at the top of his lungs over nothing. Yeah you can't have that at all. This is the same thing as a weapon. Okay? It's got a pointy edge here, and it's got a straight edge here. I'm not using it as a weapon. You are not to have these things. You understand that? There's only one knife and it's hidden. When people come over we share a knife. Jonathan cannot be around knives. It's too tempting to him. When Jonathan was five, he once became upset with his babysitter. She fell asleep and later awoke to find him... holding a kitchen butcher knife to her throat. Jonathan is fascinated by weapons of all kinds. I always knew, in my heart... that at some point Jonathan was going to be involved with the law... but when he was seven and arrested... and I saw him there in handcuffs riding in the police car... it was like everything, my whole world just crashed. I couldn't believe that it was starting so early. Why... would mommy not want you to have this? Because of what I did. What did you do? Yeah. What did he say? Cuz he went down to Bill's last time and got a gun and a knife. You're very lucky you didn't kill anybody, didn't you? Yeah. Jonathan broke into a neighbour's garage... and went straight to the guns that were kept there. When the neighbor confronted him... Jonathan began shooting. Jonathan was in the garage and had a gun. And when the neighbor got in there... Jonathan was looking for the bullets to load a forty-five caliber. He had it open and ready to load. And Jonathan fired the pellet rifle or the air rifle at him... and still had a pocket knife with him. Jonathan took the knife, which he had opened... and tried to gut him with it across his stomach. As Jonathan's gotten bigger and gotten stronger... he's more violent now than he ever was. I mean for over a year now he's been able to lift me off of him... when I'm restraining him. I can't... you know there's gonna be... it's not gonna be much longer that he's taller than I am. It took a long time to admit that I was afraid of... what he might possibly do. Lay back down. It's hard to sit here as a mother... and say that I'm afraid of my own child... and then one breath laters, one breath later... say how much I love him. And know that deep down inside my heart and my head... that fear is there. Fear? That he may possibly harm us. Kill me. Kill Randy. Lay back down. Okay, lay back down Jonathan. You're gonna hurt yourself. Okay lay back down. Child, you're gonna hurt yourself, hon. Okay. Is the bad side when you get mad? Yeah. You don't wanna see it. Really. Why not? Well this side of me is like evil. It's like the devil. That's the side. Okay? Do you like that side of you? No. And sometimes that side can be good. In a different way. Like right now. That side's being good. He knows he's different. He also knows he's very special. And we've made it clear to him that... what happened when he was a baby wasn't his fault. But he has got to learn... to get a handle on it. Or else he's not gonna have... mom and dad and all these things that he loves. He's gonna be put away somewhere. In the eighth month of her pregnancy... Patricia decided to leave the motel and signed herself... into drug treatment. Not long after that... her son was born with no apparent health problems. But Patricia had smoked crack cocaine during much of her pregnancy... and her baby could suffer effects that will not be known for years. In other ways though, she felt lucky. You know when you were pregnant and you're a prostitute, it's scary. It's real scary. A couple of times rubbers broke. You know what I'm saying? So I had a chance on either it being Danny's... or somebody else's baby. And plus the risk of AIDS, viruses, you know... infections, all that. You know? That at least I did believe in safe sex, you know I have to admit. You know? Ain't that right big boy. Patricia and her baby moved to a halfway house... where they live with other mothers who are recovering drug addicts. This is her fourth attempt at rehabilitation. Part of the treatment is group therapy. I'm Patricia, Phase One and I have six children. I have six kids. In my custody I have one. My name's Deena, I'm Phase Two A. I have two children, a son, eleven, and a daughter, eighth months. And my drug of choice was intravenous methamphedamines. My name is Lulu. I'm a mother of six. The children of these women have... all suffered from their mothers' drug abuse. And most of these women have abused themselves. Like Patricia... they were sexually molested as children... and have been victims of physical and domestic violence. I have a hard time dealing with the stress. I have a hard time dealing with the difficulties of my life... but so far today I am clean and sober... Many of the women have a history of mental illness... and have brain injuries from being abused. Problems that make rehabilitation even more difficult. And like Patricia... some have had their children taken away by Child Protection. She's gone forever. And that envelope will be closed and... sealed until she's eighteen years of age. This mother has just permanently lost custody of her child. I'll be just... It's okay, get it out, Tiffany. It's okay to. Alright ladies... Okay. You wanna do the... Do your serenity prayer. - Okay. - Okay. - God. - God. Grant me the serenity... to accept the things I cannot change... the courage to change the things I can... and the wisdom to know the difference. At the halfway house the women have a chance to nurture their children... and form stronger bonds with them. It is the kind of care some of them lacked when they were growing up. Yeah this consists of the chore of... of the porch. You gotta do the windows and the phone and... sterilize the phone and do the windows. And there's another window out here. These used to have windows, but the kids tore em apart. Beautiful, I love this one. This is the first Christmas in fifteen years that... Patricia has been off drugs. During her life of addiction and prostitution... her first five children were taken away from her. The oldest is now fifteen and Patricia knows he is homeless... living on the streets of the city. She has decided to try and find him. Saturday night in Baltimore city... where scenes like this one are common. Baltimore has one of the highest murder rates in America. He's dying. They shot a couple guns. Okay, we've got the ambulance on the way. - We've got some more people. - Right? They won't let me back in there. I heard somebody got shot in the arm eight times. It made me scared. It made it real scary. I just didn't want to leave out the house... to go to school anymore. Cuz of what that happened. It is estimated that one in five inner city children suffer from... post traumatic stress disorder. Which is the modern name for wartime shellshock. The victims become emotionally numb... and may have difficulty controlling their anger. Constant stress may even disrupt... chemical balances in children's brain. Affecting their behavior and ability to learn. Like many other children in the neighborhood... this boy lives in poverty. His father is in jail and his mother can barely feed and clothe him. This morning he's looking for something to wear to school. And these my pants. - Ma'am. - I want them read. I got them read. There are seven hundred students at the Westport school... which stands at the center of... the Westport neighborhood of south Baltimore. It is both an elementary and middle school... with grades kindergarten through eighth. Good morning to the Westport family. Good morning to all the staff, students, and parents. Let's have a good day today. Darnel Ramsey teaches math and reading in the middle school. He grew up in neighborhoods like Westport. But he says things have been getting worse. He sees children having a harder time than he did. As a teacher these past few years have been mind boggling... where I'm just totally amazed daily. Some of the things I see, even though I was raised... in this environment still amazes me. - Come here. - No. Let him go. Come here. What's wrong? Come here. - Who? - I'm gonna... Who? Where? Come here man. Come here. Be cool Joe. What did I tell you it's Friday. It's Friday, right? Calm down. Take some breaths. You've been good all week. Don't start that man. Deep breath. I see anger. Kids can't solve a problem without fighting. You just look at a kid's face and see the trouble in his eyes. There's a trouble in his face of, of his home life. Alright, gentlemen get my room picked up. Kids are just neglected. These kids on a day-to-day basis tell me about... what they have seen dead bodies in abandoned buildings. I have little kids at sixth grade raising three younger brothers. Clothes, they're washing clothes, feed their little brothers. I just had a conversation with this kid actually he pretty much... told me was his three options... was to sell drugs, use drugs or die. Eleven or twelve years old. He knows his options and he's not willing to change. What do I do? What can you do? After school Benny Warren and his friends... sometimes go to a small neighborhood playground. It is rundown and has no basketball hoops... but they feel safe there. Benny has a reputation as a tense and anxious person. It's not safe outside. There's a lot of killing. And a lot of drug dealers. And people all kidnapping children. Where I living at, my brother got killed... from the alley, where the alley I live in. And my brother, he got killed on a Seven-Eleven. But that's because of a girl. My brother got killed over money. And they ain't even taking nothing. They just killed him. What happened? He was coming back from buying me and my sister... a coat and some boots. And they took him in one of snatched his chain... around there. Then they um... theys took his money. And then they ran. Took him in the alley and set him up and shot him in the back. And then they shot him in the leg. Benny's brother was shot in the alley just behind his house. It happened two years ago when Benny was ten. Since his brother was killed... he's suffered from stomach pains and began having problems... with his temper. The end of the alley where his brother died... has become piled with trash. - Saw your brother here. - Yeah I did. And that, I went and called the police. What did you see? Just nothing but him dead. Benny remembers the crime scene. The bloody shirt and the chalk marks... where they found his brother's body. Like many crimes in Westport, the murder has never been solved. Benny has become filled with fear and worry. Couldn't even hardly sleep. Worrying about... I gotta help my mother pull through... the worries and the trouble. And my make sure my family's safe. Every morning when Benny goes to school... he passes the spot where his brother died. Alright. See how many times eight goes into nine. How many times does it? - One. - Since his brother was killed... Benny's fallen two grades behind in school. He should be in seventh grade, but he is in the fifth. His reading skills are at a third grade level. Eleven and... - One eighth. - one eighth. The average child is two to three grade levels below. And once the children enter school and they're behind... it seems as though... its real difficult for them to catch up. So the next year they're still behind. And then next year they're still behind. Alright, from that day she has not been here. Okay. - A total of seven days. - Okay. So now we need to find out whether she was incarcerated before... - or during the holiday. - Okay. Denise Taylor runs the Westport Middle School. This morning one of her problems... is an eighth grader who's been absent over a week. The student was arrested in a crack house... and is currently in jail. On a daily basis I have to be... mother, father, social worker, doctor, sometimes lawyer... sometimes sister, brother... sometimes even a preacher. These kids are in need of everything. Fights at Westport are common. Grudges from the neighborhood are often brought to school. Gail Adam's an assistant principal... who often helps supervise the cafeteria at lunch time. She fractured her wrist breaking up another fight not long ago. Diondre. I'm not taking that shit from my little brother. What's up? Come on. I said stop it. Stop it. The boys are brothers. And the reason for the fight is unclear. Recently the boys' mother died of AIDS. Their grandmother started caring for them... but then she died too. The brothers now live in a crowded and difficult situation with an aunt. There are not official records... but the Westport staff says an alarming number of students... do not live with even one biological parent. What time did you go to bed last night? Late. Why were you sleeping today in class? Woke up too early. You woke up too early. You talk to your aunt last night? Is something bothering you? You sure? Didn't you eat dinner last night? Did your aunt fix dinner last night? So what did you eat? - Nothing. - Nothing. So I imagine you are hungry. You probably need both. Hunger is a problem at Westport and for many of the students here... the schools breakfast and lunch programs provide much of their food. The demands to cope with student's problems grow bigger each year. Get ready. Good. Willy turn around. Turn around and stop. Devonte that was really great. Kevin would you like to try it for us, please. - Yes. - Could you sit nicely please. Put your finger where it belongs. Kevin put your finger where it belongs, please. Ms. Martel teaches kindergarten at Westport. She's been a teacher for fifteen years. Her students she says, are becoming harder to teach. More are impulsive and have difficulty paying attention. I don't know how to stop. Well go ahead, do it. Take it please. Do it all by yourself. Show Willy and Devonte... how to do it, okay? Come on. The children are harder to handle. I see children who can't follow the rules... children who are constantly yelling out... talking out loud when you're trying to read a story... children who are talking when you're trying to read a story... those types of behaviors. I need you to help me pass the paper towels out, okay? This year one of Ms. Martel's more difficult students... is five-year-old Kevin. Kevin needs a lot of individual attention. I cannot handle my group when he's aggressive... and when he won't cooperate. I would like for you to put your head down until I call your name. Okay? Ms. Martel, he put some scissors in my arm. Just after reading group... Kevin stabbed a little girl with a pair of scissors... so he was expelled from class for the rest of the day. Kevin is often in trouble and has no friends. The only problem now I'm having with him... he seems to be doing a lot of fighting. - Fighting? - Yeah. Did you yank him out? Kevin's aunt Gloria comes to school when there is a problem. She has been caring for Kevin since he was a baby. Why you been fighting? What happened? What happened? Kevin was nine months old when he came to stay with me. He didn't even get a chance to really... really know what a mother's love is. Kevin's mother was married to a drug addict... who abused and beat her. She was worried about her safety... and relied on her sister Gloria if anything happened to her. I promised my sister... that I would do everything that I possibly can for Kevin... that I know that she would do. It was June 11th... when Kevin s mother got killed. His father killed his mother. Kevin was right there. These are home videos of Kevin s mother before she was killed. She s holding Kevin when he was a baby. She was running out the door. And he was that's when he stabbed her in the head... when she went to turn around... and throw her hand up and he stuck her right in the heart. And the kids say that she was... swung around, spunned around and she fell. He saw the whole thing. But us, you know, we always thinking because... they babies, you know that he ain't gonna know, you know? Kevin s aunt thinks that he is still haunted by... the violent experience of his mother's death. That deep down he remembers what happened. Kevin dreams of dangerous men coming to hurt him. But he has nightmares now. Every now and then I hear... Now I go I say, you alright? Did you see that man? Along with his nightmares... Kevin's other problems Kevin are getting worse. He's been prescribed medication for hyperactivity. But his behavior is increasingly impulsive and defiant. He's been fighting and cursing at this teachers. And Kevin has begun stealing. Through no fault of his own, Kevin is in danger. More than most other children... he is vulnerable to the affects of violence and poverty. After Patricia left the halfway house... she was able to get a part-time job and an apartment. She's been off drugs more than a year. I can say I gotta home today. And I can come in any time I want, you know? And there ain't no rules and regulations. You know what I'm saying just... only the main one and that's to be clean. This is DeAngelo When he was a week old... and this is when he was first born DeAngelo. DeAngelo, this is DeAngelo and that's DeAngelo. And these are really important because... I never was able to keep pictures. I never was able to... actually have a collection of pictures... because I'd always lose them. Because I'd be moving to motel to motel... and so this is a lot for me... to be able to have 'em on my mirror... and wake up and see my pictures. They're still here. One of the pictures was taken with her fifteen-year-old son Gregory. While she was in drug treatment... Patricia found him living on the streets. Living on the street, you know, I steal clothes and food. It's the only way to get by. It s the only way to get money, break into cars like get jackets. - Whatever. - Yeah whatever. Whatever's in there, you know or... taking people down. You know. You pick out a certain guy and you follow him. If someone sees us calls the cops... the cops won't be there within like five... five minutes, ten minutes. Then we have enough time to beat his ass, take his money... and get the hell out of there. Gregory started living on the streets when he was thirteen. He was five when he was first taken from his mother. After spending years in many different foster homes... he tried living with a relative. But there, he says, he was severely abused. That's when Gregory decided to run away. I was with my buddy John, and like... we decided that we need a place to go. And this is the only place that we know... under the bridge. I don't like letting people know that I'm homeless. And like they would talk to you and you're like... oh you going to the shelter tonight? And like you're talking to somebody and they hear that... you know, what are they gonna think? - What do you think they think? - I don't know. Are you afraid they'd think? That I'm dirty and I'm fucking... I'm a bum and whatnot. I'm probably gonna be a bum for the rest of my life and... I'm useless, worthless or something. Yeah. Hey Gregory? Time to wake up. After Patricia found Gregory on the streets... they began spending time together. And when she got her apartment... Patricia asked him to come and live with her. Why don't you get us a couple plates. See that's the thing. I don't want to be inside. I want to be outside. But you're inside when you work. - I want to skate. - Patricia cared for... Gregory as a small child. But during the many years they were apart... they had become strangers. Patricia made no excuses and tried her best to explain what'd happened. He knows everything about me. He knows about my prostitution, he knows about my addiction... he knows why I wasn't with him now... that he's able, capable of... you know, of understanding. I'm afraid for my son. He's been exposed to everything. Everything. Murder... with guns. Prostitution. Drugs. Copping drugs. Everything. Where'd you go man? Fuck you. Why'd you bail? I don't know. I was gonna stay there for awhile. Owh really? See I'm wondering where the hell you guys know each other from. Sometimes Gregory disappears for days at a time back onto the streets. Streets full of other troubled youth where alcohol and drugs... are a way of life. Where's my pipe man? How come it just disappeared. After Gregory was taken away from Patricia... she would sometimes visit him. She always promised that they would soon be back... together and have a home, but it never happened. Patricia always fell back into drugs, prostitution and jail. I'm not gonna stay mad at her forever, you know? Of course I have my moments... like reminiscing about the days. She just left me and never was there for me and... you know? She'd come and go. She'd be gone for weeks or whatnot. Somebody would have to watch me. I was lost. But I have no one to turn to and no one to tell me how to live. She chose crack over me. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't like talking about things that are making me sad. I got to know how you feel. And I want to know what's going on. And alls I can say is I'm trying my damnedest to... to try to be your mom today. You know I lost you. I lost three of my other kids behind crack. I'm not doing that again... because you guys mean everything to me. And it's so hard, you know with... when I tell you this, I mean it from my heart. And I want you to be able to trust me. I want you to be able to come home. I want you to be able to put your trust... in my like you used to when you was a baby. I don't know. I have my doubts, you know? I have my doubts. I don't... I'm just getting to know you now. It s not like you know, you can't just jump... in the picture and be my mom all of the sudden. - That's right. - You know what I mean. That's right. Gregory continued to spend time on the streets... and soon he was in serious trouble. Not long after these scenes were filmed... he was involved in an assault and robbery... outside a convenience store. Gregory was arrested and found guilty of robbery in the first degree. He faces more than two years in prison. Outside the court room... his mother waits for word of Gregory's sentence. I'm scared for him, you know? And he says I just wanna go home. He just wants to go home. And I'm glad he said he wants to go home because... that's where I want him at home. I don't want him locked up like I was. I don't want him to follow my footprint. That's all. The judge decided Gregory would benefit more... from drug rehabilitation than jail. He has begun treatment. And will be on probation for one year. But the emotional scars of his childhood will stay with him. Lasting pain from which he might never fully heal. Abuse and neglect can shape an entire life. And with each new injury, the psychological damage deepens. Children's minds and emotions can be harmed in countless ways. A neglected child may never learn empathy... or caring for other people. A child traumatized by violence... can become emotionally and intellectually crippled. These hurting children can be helped. And there are people trying to help them. But often the harm is too great and helps if it comes at all... comes too late. So violent and criminal behaviors should come as no surprise. Child protection workers... counselors, foster parents and teachers... all witness these troubled children growing worse... more disturbed, more angry. All of them know much more could have been done... that these children, might not have been lost.
