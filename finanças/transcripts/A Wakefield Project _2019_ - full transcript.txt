-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- - I'm standing here with Nathan Cross, our town whose plans are to open up a second shop in our neighboring town. Nathan, we're all excited for your success. What are your plans for a franchise? - I love what I do and. - I think it's safe to say that if we don't notice anything in the next 24 hours, I think we're in the clear. The phenomena was conducted sometime between 4:45 and 5:00 a.m. this morning. If you do the math, the flare happened at exactly 4:36 a.m. There's no information on how long this kind of emergency impact will last. What are they not telling us? - Daddy! I think something's under my bed. Daddy, I think there's something in my bed. - Motherfucker! - Morning. - Breaker box is fucked. I gotta go into town and get more switches today. What's the matter with you? You look like shit. Huh? Have that dream again or the right hand get a little too vigorous this morning? - It's that same dream, it just, it seems so real. I, I keep dreaming I have a son. - I'm not gonna lie to you. If I had a recurring dream about an illegitimate child, I'd probably look like you right now. I have had that dream. Seriously though, use more lube. - I don't know if this means anything, but I woke up on the floor this morning. - You're using way too much lube. - Maybe it's this town. I mean, it's just too quiet. For the first time in my life I can hear myself think. Maybe we made a mistake coming out here. - Well, it's not the city. I'll give you that. You seen that number for that store with the switches? - Look, Reese, you're my best friend. I know I've been a little messed up every since my dad died. I just want you to know how much it means to me, you dropping everything to come out here with me and fix this place up. - I'm gonna be really honest with you. When you called me and you told me that you want us to dump our life savings into this shit hole in the middle of fucking no where and turn it into a bed and breakfast, I thought you'd completely lost your fuckin' mind, but it's the first time in a long time that I've seen you so excited about something. So, I'm glad that you're back, buddy. - Thanks, man. Love you. - It's no worries. Besides, I was tired of the city anyway. I like it here. It's nice. There's no traffic, no sirens and plenty of wholesome country girls to defile. Oh, the simple life. - Fools paradise. - Scientists have reported that the solar flare occurred as of 4:36 this morning. Alarming as it is, I'd like to remind... - What the hell is that? Oh. - I'll go check the back. Eric, what did you break? - Scientists are advising us to wait this one out for at least 24 hours. In fact, government officials are quoting the saying... - Hey, bro. - Yeah? - Come check this out. These people sound like conspiracy theorists. - Well, if it's the end of the world as we know it, all the more reason to go forth and repopulate this earth while we still can. Right, amigo? Speaking of procreation, I do believe I just saw your Google order psychic outside and she's bangable. - Okay, uh, how about you just try being a gentleman for just a day. How about that? - I still can't believe, however, that you hired a clairvoyant to come and ghost bust this joint. - Look, she's not a clairvoyant, all right? She is very educated and everything she says is based on scientific fact. An old place like this, it's bound to have a bunch of stories. I'm just not fully convinced... - I'm looking at the clock now John, and it's 8:42. - That the real estate agents told us everything we need to know. - Who cares. - For 24 hours. In fact government officials... - We got this place for dirt cheap. - Are quoted as saying. - Hello? Hello? - Hello yourself. How you doing? I'm Reese. But I'm sure you already knew that right? Am I right? Told you she's hot, boo! Listen. - Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Sorry, he doesn't get out much. I'm Eric. - Chloe. - Thanks for coming all the way down. - Well, your email sounded kinda desperate, so. - He's desperate. - I haven't been to Wakefield in a really long time. - Well, I'm glad you came. I'm, we're glad you came. - Mm hm. - Um, uh, we're happy you're here. - Well, that's my cue. You guys have fun telling ghost stories, and Chloe, it was really nice to meet you. Listen, Eric's got a problem in the bedroom you might be able to help him out with because he's really ornery and tough to deal with. - Thank you. - He's charming. - Ah, he's a little rough around the edges, but believe it or not, I'd actually trust him with my life. - I'm gonna have to take your word for it on that one. - Shall we? - So, your email said you've been having nightmares? How about any other anomalies? Have you seen or heard anything unusual while you're awake? - No, no, nothing. - And you never experienced anything like this before you moved in here? - Not that I can recall. I mean, we bought this place site unseen. I don't know, maybe it's just buyer's remorse. - Well, that could give anybody nightmares. So, how much do you know about the history of this town? - Embarrassingly, not a heck of a lot. I know this place used to be in inn back in the early 1900s during the prohibition days. Other than that, I know it's been closed for the past 10 years. Why are you from here? - No. No, I um, spent some time here a long time ago. But, no, I never had plans to set foot anywhere near here. - And yet here you are. - I got your email and um, I just had a strong feeling I needed to be here. - Oh the psychic stuff? Yeah, about that, I, I'm not really into that myself. I mean the whole ghosts and paranormal activity and voodoo, hocus pocus. I don't know, if you ask me, I just feel like it's for small minded people that like to drink the Kool-Aid. No offense, I... - Oh, no offense. Okay, good, 'cause I thought for a second. Uh, wow, no, that's okay. A lot of people feel like that. In my experience they're usually the uptight control freak types who require a logical explanation for everything. - Touche. - Look, I'm not really a psychic in the traditional sense. I don't do seances. I do not have a Ouija board. Um, my method is based in the reading of energetic frequencies. So, like everything has energy; people, buildings, this bar. That energy radiates out at different frequencies. So, for some reason I'm just able to tune in and listen to more frequencies than most people can. - So, like the frequencies of ghosts even? - Ghosts, entities, in most cases, yeah. It's just the realm of the dead broadcasts on a different bandwidth so to speak, than the realm of the living. We all share the same atmosphere though. It's really just a matter of tuning in and listening. It's just, it's a lot safer to listen to the energy of the living. - Interesting. Could you give me an example? Demonstrate? - Uh, sure. - What? - Oh, wow. - What, what? - I think you need to buy me a drink before I could repeat half of that. - You got that? Guilty as charged. - Ah, okay. I'm sorry about your dad. - Eric. - Excuse me. Reese, Reese? Last owner must have left it here. Oh, Jesus! What the... - You're such a pussy. Holy shit, look what I found. - Give me that knife. You're not sharp enough to hold a sharp knife. - Dude, 80's porn. I'm tellin' ya. Look at all these. Goldmine. We gotta find a VCR. - Why, you really wanna see your mom on tape? - Why you gotta put that kinda energy out there, man? What a zoo. God. Goddammit. Fuck. - Reese! Chloe! - Five minutes on his own. Hey. - Oh, fuck. - Are you okay? Did you pee yourself? - Fuck you, fuck off. - Show me, show me. - Eric. Eric, you saw something. What did you see? - His future as a bed wetter who never gets laid. - Reese, that's enough, all right? I don't know, I didn't see anything, I. Look, I gotta get some work done. Chloe, it was nice to meet you. I'm sorry I wasted your time. - Eric, Eric, wait. - Don't mind him. He's a bit of the sensitive type. I don't know how or why, but it worked wonders for him in college. He got a lot of tail. It's all right, to each their own. I was gonna eat that. Huh, psychic's got a hot ass. Who woulda thunk it? - Hey. - Hey. - So, I have to get going, but I feel like you need to eat something. - Oh, you're leaving already? - Yeah, I just have some errands. - Thanks for the sandwiches. - You're welcome. - Come on. Oh, look at that. How are ya? Yeah, want a hand with this? - That'd be great. Thanks. - No worries. - Guess I'm just not as young as I used to be. - Ah, now you're just lying to me. You wanna grab that one? You grab the big one. - You must be new in town. I haven't seen you around here before. - Yeah, we are. My buddy and I, we bought the old inn in town. We're fixing that up right now. - Oh. Um, how's it coming? Are you guys all right? - Yeah, we're all right. Honestly, it's taking a lot longer than anticipated, but every time you buy an old building, it's bound to happen. You know what I mean? There's always a boatload of problems. - Well, I gotta tell you that I am really surprised that a young guy like you would wanna hang around a small town like this. - What are you talking about? We love it here. Plenty of pretty girls to keep us company. Thank you. - Listen, you can just put that right there. - Okay, you sure? Just like that? - Yeah, but you know, I'm gonna go inside and get something for you because you've been so nice. - You don't have to do that, that's okay. - It's all right, I want to. Just wait here. - Thank you. Well, at least you got hired help here, huh? - Huh? - At least you got some hired help around here, right? - I haven't had any hired help around here in years. That'd be the day. I can't afford it. - Has there been anything strange happening around here lately? - Not since my husband got up this morning, told me he loved me and he'd see me later. - Okay, fair enough. - So, this book it's about the history of this town. It's written decades ago, but there's a section in here about the inn. I thought you guys might really like it. - That's very neighborly of you. Thank you very much. - You guys watch out. Take care of yourself. - Got it. Thank you. I should get going. You have yourself a wonderful evening. Holy shit. Moved to fuckin' Creepytown, USA. Best investment of my life. - Hey. - Hi. - How you doin'? I'm Reese. - I know, I'm Nikki. - That's funny 'cause Nikki's my favorite name. - Well, it must be my lucky day, hm? - Oh, yes, it is. Nikki, I gotta twist your arm for three things. First, I need breakers, electrical breakers. - Break... - It's a little black box with a switch that goes into a big gray box with a bunch of electrical wires going into it. - Yeah, no, sorry. - Okay, uh, VCR, you got any of those? - Sorry, no. Not since the 90s. - Well, there's no need to make fun of me. Do you know where I might be able to find a VCR? - Um, you could try Miguel up the road. He's got a bunch of old AV equipment in his garage. He's a little rough around the edges, but I'm sure he could help you out. - Okay, yeah. No, I think I know exactly where that is actually. Third, I was wondering if I could get your phone number. Would that be a thing? - Sure. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - All right, great, perfect. Yeah, no, I'm new in town. My buddy and I, we bought the old inn. - Really? - Yeah, he wants to turn it into a bed and breakfast. - Wow, so you guys bought the old inn? - Yes. - Wow, that place, that place has been empty for as long as I can remember. You know, people say it's haunted. - That's probably why we got such a good deal on it. - You guys must be pretty brave. Either that or totally desperate. - I'm brave, he's desperate. - Okay. That place has been around since I can remember. We used to sneak in there during high school and get drinks and what not. - That was you? Do you have any idea the mess you left? It took me two days to clean that crap up. - What, that's not fair. So, I know where to find you. - Yes, you do. And maybe you can find me tonight. We can figure out what's on those VHS tapes. - All right. - It was really nice to meet you. - Likewise. - Take care. - The government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong. - Hey, you own that inn up the street, right? - Yeah. - Nathan Cross, Wakefield's local butcher, son of Albert Big Al Cross, the local innkeeper. - Is your cellphone workin'? - In 2004, Nathan Cross took his vengeance out on seven innocent women. Six were murdered, but the final victim escaped and helped convict him and sentence him to death. Her identity remains a secret to this day. Boom, we own a fuckin' murder motel. - What are you talking about? - Apparently this place is infamous in these parts. It doesn't really surprise me because everywhere I go, everybody looks at me like I'm fucking crazy when I tell 'em I live here. - I had no idea. - The Wakefield fuckin' murders. Are you kidding me? How do you not know that when you buy a place like this? - I don't know, it was the only thing we could afford, all right? It was the furthest from the city, as soon as we had an opportunity to buy something, I just, I jumped on it. I'm sorry. - Sorry? What are you talking about? We're sitting on a fuckin' goldmine. People love this shit. All we gotta do is hire a couple girls, we'll put red wigs on 'em and we'll stock up on butcher knives. It's gonna be awesome. - I shoulda known. - Shoulda known what, Eric? One of us has to have an endgame here. I don't know about you, but all my money is sunk into this entire house of horrors. Every single bit of the renovations. And I don't know about you, but I wanna flip a profit at the end of this. This murder shit is gonna pay our mortgage. People love a bloody spectacle. - Look, I'm just not sure I'm comfortable exploiting the murders of innocent people. - It's a historical fact. History's got some gruesome shit in it, my friend. And I, for one, think you're too uptight. Look, I'm telling you this because I love you, all right? So, don't get angry. But you need to get laid. - Okay. - Now, I'm no psychic, okay? But, I'm pretty sure I saw some sexual tension between you and our little psychic friend. - Oh, come on. Maybe. - I knew it. I fuckin' knew it. Told you so. Listen, okay, you just gotta promise me one thing. Just one thing. When the time comes, I need you to promise me that you're gonna tell me if the carpet matches the drapes. - Okay, you know what? - Ah, fuck, oh, God. The murder motel has gotten to him already. Okay, look. I gotta go see a man about a VCR, and with any luck, we just found some serial killer home videos. Let's go. How did we find the only house that belonged to a serial killer? Yeah, I'm sure she's fine. I'm sure she can fend for herself. See? I told you she'd be fine. Jesus Christ. Where the fuck are you going? - She needs our help. - Not from us. The cops, maybe. What the fuck? - Jesus fuck. - Jesus, holy shit. We gotta go. We gotta go. - Go, go, go, go. - Get the fuck off me. Well, this is it. - Sure you want the VCR that bad? - Yep. - Hey. - It's Miguel, right? Listen, I'm really sorry I just walked onto your property like that. Nikki from in town, she was saying that you might be able to help me out with something. - What could I possibly help you with? - Okay, it's a bit of an odd request. I'm looking to borrow a VCR and she said that I might be able to find one here. I just need it for the night, I'll bring it back in the morning. I'll replace any damages. - What do you need a VCR for? - I've got some old family videos. I was hoping to convert them onto DVDs, savor the memory. - Family videos, huh? Yeah, okay. - Thank you. - I've seen you around. You and your little buddy in the truck. You guys just moved in just up the street, right? - Yeah. We met briefly, actually. I didn't think you remembered. Listen, if I'm steppin' on your toes showing up here like this, I understand. I can take off, man. I was just, I was really hoping I could borrow the VCR. - It's pretty uh, scary here, huh? - Nope, kinda homey. The meat hooks are especially inviting. - Yeah. Me too. I took 'em when the shop closed down. Figure you know, keep the memory alive. - Yeah, so uh, how long did you know Nathan? - Pretty well. - Yeah? - Known each other since we were kids. We weren't, um,. You know, the same as everybody else. - Yeah, no kidding. - He wasn't always a bad guy, you know. - Never said he was. Was it a girl? - His first five were red heads. What do you think? - I think it was a girl. - Yeah, it was a girl. Here you go. - Thank you. - You know, he became like one of those toys, the ones that you wind up. You let it go it just does its thing. You know, without reason. - Yeah, I understand. Listen, I'm sorry if I said anything disrespect... - I don't give a fuck about you, kid. I got my own shit. Just um, just be cautious with that house. It's honing in on something. - Wait, what do you mean it's honing in on something? - I think you already know what I mean. - Thanks for the uh. - It's Reese, right? Careful with that meat hook. - See ya. Hey, princess. Get in the truck. We gotta go. I'm going crazy, man. I'm going fuckin' god damn crazy. - It's gotta be something with the solar flares. - Yo, look, solar flare or no solar flare, this is fuckin' crazy. The energy is all wrong. - Chloe. - Yes. Amazing, did you get her number this morning? Her services would come in really handy right now. No, man,. The first time in my life I am serious and you, what are you? - It's not working, I'm not getting anything. Shit. - Me neither. - Hey, pull over here. - Yeah. What's up? - I got an idea. - Where are you going? - Just give me a second. - Hey, fuck, man. - Eric? - Chloe, Chloe, can you hear me? - Hi, I can barely hear you. - Chloe, it's Eric, we need your help. - I can barely hear you, are you feeling better? - No, where are you? Wait, Eric, need your help. - Eric, I can't understand you. - Can you hear? Hello? - Eric, I'm at the cemetery. - Can you hear me? Did you say cemetery? You gotta get outta there. No, you have to get... - Shit. Shit, my car's dead. - Just stay there, stay there. - Eric? - I'm coming to get you. - Shit. - Hey, Reese, keys. Hey, you sure you're gonna be okay here for a few minutes? - Yeah, no, buddy, I'll be fine. I got plenty to keep me company. - You sure that things gonna even work with all the electrical interference? - Absolutely, man. It's all analog. As long as the power stays on, they're all magnetically imprinted. - All right, be careful. - All right, you too. Hey listen, go get your girl. Here we go, let's go. - Well hey there, big guy. - What are you doing with that thing? - Filming my big, strong man in action. - Put it away, Sarah. - Woo! So sexy. Is your dad here? - You shouldn't be here. I don't like you here when he's around. - Stop being such a baby, it's fine. - Just go. Please. - What the hell do you think you're doin' over there? Look at ya. All painted up like an Indian, ain't ya? You think you're some kinda warrior or somethin'? Huh? You think you're so tough with all them words printed all over you. I guess I should be afraid of you. Well guess what? You're too stupid to scare anybody. Stupid and worthless as your bitch mother. At least that's why she dumped you on me, so I could deal with you on my own. When she found out what a worthless cocksucker you are. Oh, that pretty little ginger you got. She knows you're worthless too. Bet she'd rather be with a real man who knows how to spread them legs and... - Enough! - Well, do it, boy. You ain't never had it in ya. You worthless piece of shit. - Nate. - Fuckin' freak show. Ouch. Gamed by your own father. - Whore. Fuck me you fuckin' whore. My own goddamn fuckin' father. My own father. He fuckin' embarrassed me. My own goddamn father in my fuckin' fence. Oh, fuck! You made me do this. You made me fuckin' do this. Shut your fuckin' mouth for good, you whore. You embarrassed me! You made a fool of me! I can't fuckin' look at you. You got everything you deserved. But you, old man. Oh, it felt good. - Chloe, get in the car. - Just go, go, go. - You okay? What the hell is happening? - I don't know. I've never experienced anything like this before. I think it has something to do with the solar flare. - What? - Solar flares release a massive energy into the universe and they produce lots of radiation at different wavelengths. Now, I've heard they can disrupt radio communications, radars, satellites. - That's why our phones aren't workin' and the power is going in and out. - Exactly. But this, this is almost as if the solar flare changed the frequency between the living and the dead. - So what, it merged the frequencies and now we can all see dead people? - And they can see us. - So what, I mean it's all just vapors or something, right? - Depends on the entity. They all have different energies based on their pasts or the ways they died. Now, entities are often desperate to latch on to the energy of the living, especially if they had unfinished business. Even when the realms are separated it can be difficult to get them to detach, but now that the realms are overlapping. - What's to stop 'em from sucking the life out of us? Shit, shit, shit, shit. We gotta run for it. - Hey, what are you looking for? - These things can see our living energy, right? Let's change our frequency. - Hand crank radio. Low frequency transmitter. Yeah, we could use it as a shield. That might work. Where'd you get that? - Inherited it from my dad. I pulled it out of a box of his old camping stuff the day Reese and I left the city. I don't know what possessed me to bring it. - He did. - Stay close. Come on. - Eric, wait, wait. We can't stay here. We have to get Reese and go. There's something I haven't told you about this place. - What, Nathan Cross, the Wakefield Butcher murders? I know, he was put to death. - He had unfinished business. - His last victim got away. - He won't stop until he gets his final kill. - Reese. Reese! - Reese! - This guy's insane. No way. - Oh, hi. - Hey. - So, how 'bout that drink you were talking about, yeah? - How the hell did you get in here? - I told you. In high school we used to sneak in here and we would get wasted and we would do naughty things. Very, very naughty things. - Yeah, I bet. I think you've had enough... - Yeah. - To drink, don't you? - What, that's fuckin' bullshit. I haven't had a drink since last weekend. Yeah, hm? - You haven't had a drink since last weekend? - That's right. - Okay. - Uh huh. - Let's have a seat. You wanna drink? - I would love a drink. - Right, I'm gonna get you a drink. - Oh, my gosh. Oh, you're so sweet. - Yeah, aren't I? - Oh, yes. - Okay. - Reese, Reese? I'll check the kitchen. - I'll check upstairs. Reese! - Are you all right? - Reese. Reese. - Chloe, where's Eric? - He's downstairs. Come on, we have to go now. - He's downstairs, okay. - Bring your friend. - Eric. Start the truck, we gotta go buddy. - We're not going anywhere. Chloe and I, we got here on foot. We uh, we had to run. The truck's dead. - Fuck. - Who's she? - Nikki, his date. - Dude, really? - Oh, calm down, dad. Okay, just 'cause you decide to live like a... - Look, look, look, enough, enough, that's enough. - Okay, look, Eric, I don't know how to tell you this. But the video tapes that I found downstairs, I watched them. I saw... - Me. I was Cross's last victim. That was 10 years ago. I was a few towns away visiting a friend and he just grabbed me right off the street. I guess I was an easy target. He took me here and he chained me up in the cellar for weeks. The shackles were rusty and eventually I was able to work my way free. I was so weak, but I found a tunnel and I followed it to a staircase and when I got to the top, I was in a different building. - The prohibition tunnels for the booze runners. That's what you used. - I went to the police and he was convicted for the murders of those women and he was put to death. But now, with the solar flare. - He's come back to claim his last victim. - I saw him. Today in the cemetery, he was there, and he's coming back here. I'm sure of it. - So we either get our heads chopped off by a butcher or go outside and get sucked dry by parasites. Worst date ever. - What? - Oh, my God. - What's wrong with her? - Oh, she's got three entities on her. They're feeding off her life force. No, don't. Don't touch her or they'll latch onto you too. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, what about the radio? - No, no it's too late. They've almost drained her completely. Unless the effects of the solar flare wear off, they'll just keep feeding on her until her heart stops. - What do you mean heart? What happens at that? - Possession. - Eric. - Shit. - Nope, not happening. I'm not going down without a fight. There's a shotgun in the basement. - There's flashlights in the truck. - Eric, no. - Chloe, we'll be okay. Stay with Nikki. - Just be careful. - Yeah, I'll be careful too. Don't worry about me. - Reese. Reese. Chloe, you okay? Chloe you in here? I'll check. Chloe? - I don't fuckin' know. Eric? - I see 'em. - Hey, you big motherfucker. Eric, get the fuck outta here. - Reese, Reese, Reese, you have to wake up. Please, wake up, Reese. Please, wake up, Reese. No. - God. Eric. Motherfucker, go, Eric, just go, go, fuckin' go. Go, go, go. - Where's Nikki? - I looked for both of them up there, I can't find 'em. - Where are we going? - What are you doing? We gotta go. We gotta go right now. - I can't leave her. I can't leave her. - What, Chloe? She's gone. She's gone, Eric. I'm sorry. - I know she's in there. I'm not leaving her. - Do you know what happens to both of us when we go in there? - I'm goin' in. I can't leave her. - Tell me you know she's in there. Tell me you can feel it right now, say it! - I feel it. - You feel it? - I feel it, I... - Do you, do you feel it? Say yes. - I know she's in there. - Let's go. You better be right about this. - Chloe? Where's that coming from? - I don't fucking know. - Chloe? - Fuck. The fuck is that noise, man? - Chloe? - Cocksucker. - Chloe? Chloe, is that you? Chloe, is that you? Chloe, it's me. - What the fuck is that noise, man? What the? It's locked! - Chloe! It's Chloe. I thought you were dead, where were you? - I was upstairs running from Cross. He's still up there somewhere. - Ah, geez, I was so worried about you. - I'm fine, don't worry about me. - Reese. - Reese. Oh, my God, Reese. - Come on, come on. Get up, get up, get up. - All right, okay, all right. - I thought you were dead. - Okay. Son of a bitch. - All right, go, go, go. - Eric, upstairs, go upstairs, go upstairs. - Fire escape. - Go, go, go, go, go, go. - Fucker. - Eric, come on. - I'm right behind you. - Eric's fine, Eric's fine. - Reese. - Careful, okay, go, go, go. Eric, let's go, man. - I'm coming, I'm coming, be careful. - Eric, let's go. It's okay, be careful, Chloe, be careful. Eric, let's go. - Careful Chloe... - Eric! Eric! Ah, come on. Eric! Oh, man. You don't wanna do this. Come on, it's okay, just please, just please let him go. - Don't do it, Reese. - Take me, I'll do anything. I'll do anything. Just tell me what you want, please. Just anything. - Die. - It's too late. - No, no, no, no. No! - It doesn't. - Hello? - Mission. - Eric, Eric. - Chloe! - Where's Reese? Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Morning. - Good morning. How did you sleep? - Like a rock. I just had the best dream ever. - What were you and little Reese doing this time? - Camping. I was teaching him to chop firewood. - Well, you should dream me in sometime 'cause I kinda feel like I'm missing out on all the fun. - Aw, babe. I'm so sorry. I have an idea. How about... We have our own fun time. Right now. Hm? - Okay. Eric, you're hurting me. Eric? Eric, you're hurting me. - You made me do this. You made me fuckin' do this. Shut your fuckin' mouth for good, you whore. You embarrassed me! Made a fool of me! I can't fucking look at you. You got everything you deserve.
