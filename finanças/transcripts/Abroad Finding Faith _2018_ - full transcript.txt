Hello? Hello, this is Michelle. Nice to meet you. Is this Daniella? I think you have the wrong number. Wrong number? Hey, did you get a bit lost? I thought you said you'd be here around nine? Uh, yeah, the tram only takes me to the big street. Yeah, Princes Street. Yeah. This city is very beautiful. Yeah, nowhere compares for me. So this is your room. It's pretty much the same as the pictures you'd have seen back home in China. And the bathroom. The hot water takes ages to heat up, but it gets there eventually. And the kitchen's through here. So who makes our meals? Make our meals? What, like a chef? Yeah, we had got a special chef in our dormitories in China. Oh. We don't really have anything like that here. We just make our own. Anyway, I'm a bit late for an appointment, so make yourself at home and get some rest if you're tired. Have a nice meeting. You know what you want? Eh, I don't know these dishes. Can maybe you recommend me one? Well, it depends what you like. Can I have this, please? Take a seat, I'll bring it over when it's ready. Excuse me, the vegetable, it's not heated. It's a salad, it's meant to be cold. Hello Dad, Mum! Michelle! How are you? Why couldn't I get in touch with you? I didn't have Wi-Fi earlier I'm alright. Not used to the weather yet. It's much colder here than home. Try to wrap up! What time is it in UK now? Have you had your meal? It's already 2 pm. I had some salad for lunch in the caf√©, quite tasteless. Just salad? You should have some proper food! There are not many options Plus, they are very expensive Don't worry about the money! I'll send you more if you don't have enough Try to get on well with your teachers and classmates Any new friends? I will see teachers and classmates tomorrow No new friends yet And I havn't seen any Chinese ye Be careful to make friends in a foreign country Remember it's important to have a good relationship with your teachers Got it! Try to eat a bit more tonight! Is this for keeping hands warm? No, no, that's for taking hot things out the oven. Oven, I don't know about the oven. Right, yeah, there's probably a lot to adjust to I guess. Is this your first time abroad? Abroad? Oh, yes, outside China. Yeah, it's my first time. Were you looking for something? Yeah, do you have the congee? It's for breakfast. This is all I have for breakfast in this cupboard. Maybe you can buy some at a supermarket. There are some Chinese supermarkets in Edinburgh I think. Maybe be careful. It's not good to near the microwave for radiation. Hi, I will look at the city center today. Nice to meet you again. Um, it might be a bit too warm for all that. Search: How to stir fry Firstly, put some oil in a pan, wait until the oil is heated... You all right? It's all burned. Hey, hope we haven't woke you. D'you want to join us? I feel too sleepy to play. It has been midnight. Oh, okay, sure. Good night. Hi mum Hi, my dear how is everything? How were you last night? Sorry mum, I think I'm late now Hi, are you also a Business Mangement student? Yes! Are you both? I'm Michelle, what about you? I'm Xiao Chun Fang Fang Did you guys come here together to study? Yes, we were pre-sessional students over the summer And also we are from the same high school We also have some other classmates together That's good. I only arrived two days ago because of the visa delay Oh... Did you come here by yourself? I don't know if I could have done that Yes, I did feel some nerves at the beginning But I always feel that we should face our challenges and it can make us stronger I hear there are many societies have fresher's activities... Would you like to come with us to look? Great! (Posting Pictures and Comments: Michelle has arrived in Edinbrugh safely:) Oh, hey, listen, sorry about the noise yesterday. I maybe should have told you some friends were coming for a while. Oh, it's okay. Did you enjoy the time? Yeah, just had a little too much to drink. You can join us next time. We'll probably meet at one of my friends' place next week. Ugh, my mom phoning to check up on me. Will you not answer your mom? Yeah, but not every time. I'm in my third year now. My parents would be very worried if I never answer. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love my parents. But if I called my mum every day, I don't know, she'd drive me crazy. D'you not want a bit more independence? Well, I don't mind, but I always think it's good to keep in touch and show respect to them. Congee. Feel free to try some. I got it from Chinese supermarket. Do you understand the lecturer's accent? Very strong. Is that Scottish accent? I wish he would slow down There are so many internationals in this course And the reading list is so huge I definitely can't remember all of them Exactly. The first essay is even due in middle October I'll probably not be able to go to the dancing class I signed up for By the way, do you know anything about the parties here? What parties? My flatmate is a local girl, she seems to like having parties They do a lot of drinking and listen to loud music Oh yes, this seems normal here It's just part of the culture to spend time together Yes, but the way some of the girls dress in the party are too exposed Seriously, do they not feel cold? Yes, it's only autumn, I really don't look forward to a cold winter Do you think the weather is the biggest problem here? No... the food The food here is really tasteless By the way, I have found a Chinese supermarket nearby But I never really cooked in China so not sure how to make the dishes But I can do soup at least We are quite fortunate, there are three other Chinese students in our dormitory One guy is very good at cooking so he has made us many delicious dishes Oh, that sounds so amazing! I know a good app on the phone for simple dishes Do you have a rice cooker? My mum has given me a small one We also have two in the dormitory. One for cooking soup, and one for rice Hi mum and dad, I'm going to prepare cooking tonight for my flatmate Really? Can you cook now? What are you going to cook? Yeah. I bought some ingredients from the Chinese supermarket I'm going to make a simple soup Very good! My daughter has grown up How's your study? Do you start from this week? Yes, we have started the course this week A little difficult to understand the accent of the teacher Also there are already a lot of tasks for us Try to work hard, don't forget that's your priority staying in UK If you don't have enough money just let me know Ok, I'll bear this in mind Be careful for cutting the vegetables! Hello, Daniella, this is Michelle. Oh, hey, what's up? I have made some noodle dish. Would you like to try some? Oh, that's so sweet, but I'm afraid I'm going out with some friends from my course for food now. But hey, listen, I'm actually meeting with some friends tonight if you want to come? Oh, I would like to come. Where shall we meet? I'll meet you back at the flat, I need to get back to get changed. Is there any dressing code? No, it's just a chance to hang out and have some fun, but you can wear something nice maybe. Oh, thank you. I'll be back about seven, and then we can go after that. See you later. Sure, see you later. Is this okay? Yeah, sure. Ready to go? Will you not be cold? No. It's just a ten minute walk, and then we're indoors for the night. There you go. It's vodka and cranberry. I made sure it's not too strong because I thought maybe you're not used to drinking. Yeah, thank you. Cheers. Daniella? Hi, I'm Jack. I don't think I've met you before, have I? No, it's my first time to visit. Daniella invites me. Down it, down it, down it, down it! Whoa. Thanks, guys. That's the taxi here. Yeah. Whoa. Bye, guys. Hey, have fun last night? Yeah, but sore head. I have some painkillers in the kitchen. They're good for a hangover. No, thanks. Do you know what time it is right now? Um, it's 10:40. What? I have go lecture at ten! Well I think you might struggle to make that. Are you alright? I'm ok, just have bad headache aswell as a stomach ache I probably couldn't make the lecture later Oh well Go back to have some rest and make sure you drink plenty hot water Michelle, how are you? We havn't heard from you today We need to go to bed now Just leave a message and let us know how everything is We can use some of this. Oh, I don't know. Maybe that would be a bit too much. Oh come on Michelle, you've got a great complexion. You'll look great. That guy seemed keen. Parents calling Call rejected So what's happening with Jack? I don't know him well. He's a friend of one of my classmates, but he seems all right. Well, he has been very caring to me, especially in a new culture. But it's difficult. Why? What's up? Actually, I have never had a proper boyfriend before. And certainly not a foreigner. I don't think my parents would ever accept him. So what? It's all part of the experience. Doesn't mean you have to marry him. Someone hungry? I guessed by your text message earlier that you wouldn't have eaten much today. So I thought I'd pop by, make sure you didn't fall asleep in this cold library on an empty stomach. Oh, that's so nice, thank you. Have a seat. So, Michelle, It's been a month since you started your coursework. You're doing a business management with a couple of science modules, is that correct? Yeah, I have learned so much, And I feel Edinburgh has good many beautiful sceneries. Oh, I haven't visited the castle yet. Do you like the castle? Uh, yes, yes, it's very nice. But I wanted to talk about how you felt you were getting on with the coursework. I noticed that you've missed a few lectures and you didn't pass the assignment that you handed in last week. It seemed like you didn't understand the question. Yeah, sorry. I will try harder in the future. Look, Michelle, I appreciate that this can be a difficult situation. You've come to a new country, we have different ways of doing things, and this is your second language as well. Right now I think you just need to work on managing your time a bit better and prioritize getting to your classes. Okay. So d'you think it's been difficult settling into such a different culture? Yeah, I have many big difference, like the foods, the weather, and sometimes people are more individual, not doing many things together. But I feel I can really improve myself in this town. I really want to improve my English. I've had such an amazing time getting to know you. I think you're so beautiful and cute at the same time. I might be quite shy. It's my first relationship with a boy. I don't want you to feel rushed, I just hope we can keep getting to know each other better. Michelle, it's your mum here We are worried about you You rarely call us nowadays What's happening in the UK? Are you studying hard? Let us know how you are Hi, Dad, Mum... I am fine Sorry I am just really busy with studies just now Maybe I can call you this weekend? I am definitely safe here I have learned many new things So don't worry about me Hey, I got a letter from the landlord of the flat today, saying that the gas and electricity prices have increased, so we need to increase the rent by 20 pound. Oh, you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? How d'you pay the bills and pay for food and things? Well, I have got some cards, and my parents support me for the payment. That's a pretty good deal. So how does that work, do they transfer money to you? Eh, no, just the card has got some money when I need. And also I can take some money out of the machine, which I learned. Look, Daniella, I think I have got some difficult with my parents. I don't know how to hare with them about foreign guy. And I also got some warnings about my school work. Oh, I don't really know what to say, to be honest. It wouldn't be an issue to me. Anyway, if you get the chance, I would try and set up some sort of UK bank account. It might help paying for some things. It's hilarious. - Oh, no. - She was totally thrown out, and then the police got her, and then it was like. Hey, I was getting worried about you. D'you want to join us for a quick drink? What's wrong? So I tried to give him a surprise visit, but I saw him with another girl. Oh, Michelle, I'm so sorry. Are you sure they were together? Yeah. He had his arm round her, they were laughing together. And he didn't send any message to me or any call to me. Listen, I think you should try to get some sleep now. We can talk about this tomorrow, yeah? Demonstrate it as well. So you should all look forward. Generating sources that are plotted around the country. Having resistors to use. Generation and things, they're kind of very large power stations. Hello? Michelle Hello, mum! Why have you not been answering our calls and messages? I'm sorry. I've been trying hard to get settled here But I found it so difficult Everything is so different and I don't know anybody here Michelle, it is less than two months until Christmas How about you come back home to have a break? Right now you don't need to worry about adapting to anything Just focus on the studies This is why you are here Yes, I know I'm not sure about coming back But I will try to make sure I call more I miss you a lot We miss you too Michelle! So this is Rachel last Saturday night. Look at the state of her! She only had about four drinks. I know, let's see if Jack has Facebook. What, how? I'm sure he'll have a page. Ah. Well, he certainly likes a good night out. Doesn't seem to update his page much though. It's Jack. What d'you want to do? I don't know. What do you think? Maybe see what he's got to say for himself? Hello, Michelle. I'm really sorry, my phone got stolen a few nights ago when I was out. I've not had the chance to contact you. I saw you with a girl the other night. You had your arm round her. What? What girl? A girl I don't know. I saw you together outside of your place. I'm not together with any other girl, Michelle. I don't understand. I saw you were together. So? I have a lot of friends here, it doesn't mean anything. We're just a little bit more expressive in this culture, I guess. Aww baby, I'm really sorry you've got so upset over this. I already told you that I like you. I'm not interested in other girls like that. I thought you had another girl. Of course not. You're special. I'll need to make sure I've got other ways of contacting you in case I have problems with the phone or internet. What d'you think of this dress for tonight? Tonight? Yeah, we're going round to Shelley's place, remember? I'm sorry, Daniella. I have made a date with Jack tonight, and I think I need to do some studies first. So you guys back on then? What's this? I don't know. A girl gave me in my journey. Gospel Martial Arts? What's that? Ooh, a free self defense course. We should do it. You dunno what weirdo you might meet on a night out. Here you go. Look, I got a new one. Oh, it's nice. Now I can fill my phone with pictures of my stunning girl. Welcome. You guys here for the GMAU? Yeah. Great. We get started downstairs in just a few minutes, and then the adults will come back upstairs for the self-defense course. Hello, I'm Sarah, one of the Kosempai here. Welcome to our class. Sensei! Seiza. Jesus Christ, supreme master of life. Jesus Christ, supreme master of life. King of kings, Lord of lords. King of kings, Lord of lords. Savior of the world. Savior of the world. Welcome to your first class. So downstairs two of my Kosempai, which means assistant instructors, are gonna be leading the kids class. And up here, over the next eight weeks, we're gonna be going through some basic self-defense maneuvers. Now, what's different about the way we do things here is, we don't just deal with the physical person. It's not just about body mechanics. We also deal with the person mentally and spiritually so that you can peacefully find ways to resolve conflicts. And we base this on our desire to live our lives like Christ. Why couldn't I get the necklace? It was so pretty. It was 2,000 pounds, of course it was pretty. If I had a Chinese boyfriend, I would get that. I'm not Chinese. Oh, this is Jack, and these are my friends. Oh, what's your English names? It's, it's okay. You can say your Chinese names. My name is Shao Trin. Shong Shun? Fun. Sorry, babe, I need to go now. I'll call you tomorrow. Good, and yank 'em forward. Make sense? Great. Ready to give it a try? Sure you are. Come on, let's go. Okay, she's gonna be your attacker, you're gonna come in with an overhand right, nice and slow. Okay, I want you to do the deflect, grab the arm, knee, kick the foot out, okay? Give it a shot. Go ahead. Hey, nice work. First shot, you're a natural. All right. You guys wanna give it a try? Could your flatmate not manage tonight? Yeah, it seems she's quite busy recently Maybe after class we can exchange contact details It would be good to meet up at some point Great Hi, Daniella. Did you forget about the class today? Yeah, I don't think I'm going back, sorry. I have three assignments to do by mid-November and I found out that all three of my exams are in the first week of December. Oh yeah, the exam just come out now. Oh, it's that time now. I will be late for my meeting. I will call you back later. Okay. Actually I didn't really have a interest in self defence before But my flatmate encouraged me to come It's been a lot of fun Yeah, and Sensei is very experienced I heard he doesn't get paid for this job, right? I was surprised this was a free course Well actually it isn't his job He does this because of the spiritual meaning behind it When we recite that creed and when Sensei talks about the Christian principles It's because the GMAU is about developing our characters as Christians For example, how to be able to love, care and protect in situations... where we face conflict or struggle Is Christianity like a Western cult? I have never heard of it in China We woudln't say it's a cult It's more about a relationship with God through Jesus My mum became a Christian in China Really? So you believe there's a God? Yes, with all my heart My parents brought me up to become stronger and work harder when I am struggling They said believing in God is a sign of weakness and ignorance Sorry, maybe it sounds too conservative No, it's fine. I personally think it might be good for you to explore different things in the UK We also run a free English class on Friday nights if you're interested Or you can come to our church whenever you want Ok, maybe the English class wil be good for me if I have time Welcome to our English class. Would you like to sit down? I think we can get started now. A few of us are just gonna hang out and have some drinks. What's wrong with you? Here, have a drink of this. I get so tired reading English I don't understand this at all Yes, I think you missed the lectures when we look at this chapter Maybe spending too much time with the foreigner? What do you mean? Your boyfriend Can your parents accept him? I think I'll maybe try to do more study at home And do you know who is our shield and protector? Jesus! That's right, Jesus! And anytime we feel alone or afraid, we can pray to Jesus and He will be our shield and our protection, better than the best martial artist in the world. Ain't that awesome? Yeah. Okay, all right, what do we have for prayer requests? Yes? Endangered animals. Endangered animals, that's a good one. Yes? Um, teachers. Pray for teachers, thank you very much. Carrie? For Michelle's leg. You know what, every week you all want to pray for other people. You always think of others first, and I think that is just awesome. And Michelle came in this week even though she hurt her leg last week. Hi, Jack. Good, thanks. Watching the movies. Hi, my name is Mixue, and people here usually call me Michelle. I am from Sichuan province, I'm studying business management. Hello, I am Diana, I'm from Italy. Okay, my name is Bradley. Oh, it's the same room for the GMAU Yeah. Oh this Endian, she is the pastor's wife in our church Hello Oh you're so young! So where's your flatmate? Oh, she's in the library. She has been quite busy with her study recently. Her exam just started this week. What's this? Oh, it's ice cream. You mean frozen cream? Yeah, I made it. What? That's iced cream. It's different from ice cream. Don't you want to try? No, that won't taste nice. But you can. I've really missed you this week, you're so cute. Let me just nip to the toilet first and then I want to see your reaction when you try it. What are you doing with my phone? Who is Lauren? Lauren? I don't know. She just messaged you about last night! Why have you always lying to me? I thought I was special! Look, you are. Lauren's just a girl I've met a couple of times. I didn't realize we were exclusive. Western attitudes to relationships are different. I'm sorry, babe. Look, I can let her know that it's over. I don't want to lose you over something so small. It's not small. I can't trust you! How can I trust you? You don't message me because you were with other girls. Michelle. Get out, get out! Is today your first exam? How are your exams going? Not bad so far, last one tomorrow, but it's the one I'm dreading. Wow, this is new. No microwave for the cereal? Everything okay? I'm fine. Hello Mum Yes I just had the exam Mum, I really miss home I'm sorry Yes, I'm safe Oh someone is trying to call me. Wait, hang on Hi Sarah Yeah I'm just a bit tired Yes I'll be free This is the first proper Chinese food I've had since I came to the UK. So tasty! I can't believe you have time to cook with such a young baby It's nothing special. My mum is also good at cooking Endian, are you going to be able to go back this year? I doubt it Michelle, this is my husband, Greg. He's one of the pastors of our church. Hello. Hi, so do you speak Chinese? I heard the church is in Chinese language. Oh, I speak a little, but I certainly couldn't preach in Chinese. We've got our special service in the afternoons in Chinese. Because we're so international, we've got many different fellowships in different languages. And you'd be more than welcome to come if you're free. Thank you, but I'm not a Christian though, but I think people in the church is very warm. Oh, it doesn't matter. You can come even though you're not a Christian. People would love to see you, and there's always free food afterwards. Delete the contact number of Jack Confirm? Confirmed - Like that last one was it. - Oh, hey. Hey, do you want to join us? It's a no more exam celebration. Maybe not. Shall we have a catch-up later? Okay, yeah, that would be great. Sorry I am late. I didn't see the time just now. It's okay. Actually, I was gonna ask if you'd be interested in joining our advanced class. Oh, what's this? Well, after the adult self defense and kids class from six to seven, I teach a class for the Kosempai and the apprentice instructors. We figure since you've been coming so regularly you might wanna join us. Oh, it sounds quite good. So what do I need to do? Interesting you should ask. Initially you can join as an apprentice, all you really need to do is get one of these uniforms. Yes, and Endian has suggested you can do a short study about Christianity with her. And it connects with the spiritual values with this work, too. Oh, that's really good. I think I really need to learn more. Great, well, I'll let you two get that sorted out. We'll get started over there just a minute. Oh, thank you. Okay, lift this leg up. Roll. Perfect. Yeah, say if you get a problem with. Unless the box is really empty. If it is a full box. Dear Michelle, Merry Christmas! Love, Sarah You definitely sound happier now Yes, I have made new friends here They are showing me care When will you have the winter break? I'm not sure yet. I will do some more study during the holiday I also want to spend more time with friends Ok. Do you have any exam results yet? Not yet, but I also have assignments for the course What do you eat everyday? Do you eat enough vegetables each day? Yes. I even have some friends to cook together with sometimes Good. You can ask them to teach you some things I can't believe this is your first time to have fish and chips. Well? It's too dry. Too dry? This is one of the best in Edinburgh! Maybe needed some flavor. There's some sauce in the shop. Okay, I can still eat. I'm sorry I haven't been very open with you recently. Oh, well, I thought some things were going on. But I've been too busy with my studies I feel like a bit of a rubbish friend. No, I think you have been a really special friend for me. I feel very thankful for such a flatmate I have got in this new city, especially for I don't have many close friends. So I guess things with Jack aren't so good? Well, he has got other relationships. I don't think he's honest to me. I'm so sorry, that's awful. That's fine. I feel my heart is starting to mend. Actually I have started to make some friends through GMAU. This period of my life is nothing like my expectation. I feel I have got some new learnings. What are you doing here? I remember you came to this thing. I've missed you. I, I don't. Come on, babe, I know you've missed me. No, I don't, I don't miss you. What's going on? Look, we're talking, yeah? Doesn't look like that to me. And what's it got to do with you? We wanted to make sure she got home safely in case that guy tried to follow her. He wouldn't do that. I think this proves you're better off far away from this guy. I better be going. My wife's gonna be wondering where I am. Thank you for helping me tonight. These are the situations we train for. I don't understand why does the Bible here say we are separated from God Does God not love us? Yes, Michelle, that's a really important question Well, let me put it like this When you ignored your parents and hid things from people and told lies... Did anyone teach you to do that? Mmm... not really Exactly. A very young child knows how to grab other children's toys without learning If he can't get it, he would even cry and scream Why do you think this is? In the Bible, it is said everyone is sinful This sin doesn't simply mean like a murder or arson It's more about the issues in our heart For example, being jealous, arrogant and selfish are sins We naturally just want to live for our ourselves and reject God But how do we know God really exists? Yes, Michelle, when you see everything in this universe is so beautiful and in good order Do you think they all happen to be together without a purpose? Nowadays many scientists have discovered a lot mysteries in the universe But they can't answer why we are here So the purpose behind this must be a great and wise creator And He created us He hasn't created us like robots He wants to build a relationship But like we said earlier, a perfect God has to separate with us as sinful people So what could be done? Now other religions will tell you need to do good works and follow some religious practices In order to be more perfect and reach the paradise But you can imagine... A glass of purified water will be contaminated by a single drop of ink No matter how much more clean water we try to fill into it, it's still polluted Just by ourselves, it's impossible to change anything It's like even if we do a lot of good things, the root problem of our heart can't be sorted out The Bible says, "For god so loved the world that He gave His only Son" that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life." Thank you. I think I have learned many new things tonight You're welcome Michelle Michelle, if you believe that you are a sinner and you truly repent of your sins then by believing in Jesus, that He has died for your sins you can have a new relationship with God and the promise of eternal life with Him in heaven Have you checked the exam results? They came out earlier. I managed to pass which is a big relief Dad, Mum... I passed my exams! So where will you go for Christmas next week? I think I will go to the church They will have a meal gathering after the service Church? What's that? Church is the place where Christians meet together Christianity? Isn't that some western religion? Yeah, I hear they do a lot of brain washing No, they're actually really nice people I feel it's given me many new thoughts about life You can also come if you're free Look, Jane says she got 85% in her exam Excuse me, do you have cai xin here? Some what? Oh. This. Um, I'm sorry, no, I don't think so. Can I have this? Yes, of course, that will be 70p, please. Oh, I'm afraid we don't take card here. - Hi. - Hi. I have brought some vegetables for you Oh... thank you Unfortunately my baby is awake now Sorry for being late, I spent too much time for getting the vegetables Everything ok? I decided to study in Edinburgh because I wanted a new experience I also felt I could get a better qualification for working back in China But in this time I have encountered many cultural shocks that I didn't expect I feel I have been very na√Øve with many things I have wasted a lot of time going to parties I feel I have been very na√Øve with many things I've grown up with the attitude that when I struggle I should try to work harder Then I can find the solutions to the problems and overcome them But recently I have realised that I'm not as strong I thought In this time I've face bigger tests than I have done before The Bible said, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness" One day, I saw an old man struggling to walk He had to use a crutch to support him And that's when I realised, we are all like this in life We are so vulnerable There are so many things I don't know, so many things I can't control I'm so limited And I'm also a sinful person I have done many stupid things, and I've said hurtful things Especially ignoring my parents for a period I thought I didn't But I do need Jesus, as my crutch I now see this is so vital to me It has changed me, changed me in values, and even my thinking, my perspectives I can't find the answers of the my life from a successful job or excellent study I certainly can't find them by going abroad Now since coming to church I start to understand I believe God's power is made perfect in my weakness Do you believe Jesus has died for you? If you pray to God to repent of sins and confess that Jesus is Lord then you will be His child It doesn't mean you won't have sufferings in your life anymore But Jesus will always be with you He won't simply be your crutch, He will be your Saviour and your closest friend I believe this so much I feel such a deep feeling in my heart It's difficult to describe Have you prayed to God before? Not really. I don't really know It's just talking to God as if He was right beside you Because His Spirit is here When you speak from your heart, He is listening At the end, you can declare Jesus Christ's name, and say, "Amen" Do you want to pray? I don't really know you But I know you know me, and I love you so much Lord, I want to say sorry I am so sorry for all the times I have lied and cheated I am so sorry many nasty comments I have ignored and hurt my parents since I have come to Edi I am so weak God Lord, I need you You love me so much and have chosen me... such a weak and insignificant person You even sent your son Jesus to die for my sins Thank you so much Lord, I need your forgiveness and salvation I pray in the name of Jesus Amen Amazing Grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost But now I'm found Was blind, but now I see Oh! Ok it's 10 pm now We can have a time to pray together to thank God for what He's done for us this year Then we can watch the fireworks together So as I was thinking about the year, I really found it difficult actually My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and she is only 54 And I had some really hurtful situations in my work, and I couldn't sleep very often I thank God When I think about how much people are suffereing and my own family struggles I am thankful that I know God Also feeling grateful that I have hope in Him Seeing how people in our church have grown Even recently seeing Michelle come to join us She has accepted Jesus to be her Saviour It's been so incredible and joyful So I'm so thankful that God has given us so many blessings Eight.. Seven.. Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Happy New Year! Happy New Year. Happy New Year, Daniella. What did you get up to last night? Oh, I spent some time with the people from the church. You're really hooked on that Christianity thing, aren't you? Good for you. But it doesn't mean you can't join us for a few drinks, though. Michelle, this is for you. Oh, what's this? It's our leadership training contract. I spoke with some of the pastors and I told 'em about your commitment to this ministry. We think you're definitely ready to join us. I don't know, I don't think I'm ready yet. I don't know many things about the bible or the martial arts. That's why you continue to come as well, so you can keep learning. You see, we see new faces in here all the time, and you can make people feel welcome. You've got that gift. Hello Dad, Mum! Michelle! You look thinner. Are you eating properly? Yes Mum, maybe it's the camera angle Listen. I want to talk to you about the new group I'm part of recently Do you remember I said that the self-defence class is part of a church? Yes Well I started to go to that church to have a look I feel I have learned a lot of new things about myself and about God Stop this I understand that this is a different country with different values But you must remember where you are from. You are Chinese, and your future is here So don't get brainwashed! What? I do have perspective Michelle, you are still very young. Let's not talk about such things just now When does your next semester start? Dad, this is important to me! Why are you always treating me like I'm so childish? Because you are acting this way You haven't been away from us for any length of time and... You're already talking like a foreigner When you think about your life as a Christian, it can be difficult Because this world doesn't know or believe what you believe We need to understand that only God can change people Pray for that change Pray for God to work in people's lives And pray that God can use you in anyway I just feel like my parents will never understand I feel like my university friends, even my flatmate, nobody really gets it But today's sermon really spoke to me I feel I feel really encouraged Feel free to invite your classmates and flatmate to our church We have many social events Our brothers and sisters can also build realtionships with them I just got a Facebook friend request from someone. Oh, who? You, of course. When did you create that? Oh, yeah, last night. I find many of my friends use this more than WeChat or QQ. Oh, would you mind if I invite people to come around on this Saturday night? I will cook and tidy up. [- Yeah, sure. You don't need to ask permission. So would you like to come? Yeah, I'm free. It's about time I taste some authentic Chinese food. It's not that special. - Hello. - Hello again. - Hi. - Hi, there. I'm Michelle's English teacher. Hi, I'm Daniella. Hi, I'm Lindy. Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hi, I'm Rabosite. - Hi. Is everything ok? I don't know. I feel this hasn't cooked fully Let me help you It's ok, I can try to manage Thank you. So we're just gonna be eating through here. Sorry it has been some delay. Delay? Come on, 8:30 is the perfect eating time. Hey, you've gone to all this trouble. Don't worry about it, we've been having fun. Okay, I think we can eat now. Should I just pray? Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for bringing many friends and thank you so much for preparing us so much food. Thank you in Jesus's name, amen. Let's eat I'll catch up with you later Hello Michelle. How's the new term going? Yes, really good. I feel so much more relaxed But I still sometimes feel cold By the way, I wodered if you had thought about baptism before? Baptism? Hello Dad, Mum! Darling Michelle, how are you? I'm good, I feel very happy just now Do you remember we spoke about me coming back at some point? Yes Well I think it's going to be too busy over these next few months to come back now But I was thinking, perhaps you can both come to visit Edinburgh? Michelle, that would be very difficult I have my business and we need to apply for visas I can help you with applying visas. And I have a special time for you to come Oh? I am going to get baptised by the church next month In the ocean Baptised? What is this? It's a thing where I go under the water and come back out to symbolise my spiritual death and new life as a Christian Michelle, we have already spoken about this. Why do you still not listen to me? I know Dad, and I respect what you say and I love you both so much It is why I really want you to come to witness this moment I think it will make sense that you see what my life is like in the UK Please really consider about it Jesus Christ, supreme master of life.

Michelle, it's mum. I know you were upset that we didn't give an answer to come to visit After we've discussed this, we think it's right that we should come to visit You're our daughter and our treasure and we will always love you We are happy when you are happy I hope you can still help us with the visa because there isn't much time We can talk later on the phone My parents will come to the UK. Great! The first picture's a symbol of you dying towards. ‚ô™ Jesus ‚ô™ Saved my soul As soon as the Lord Jesus called to him by name. ‚ô™ When He died for me ‚ô™ All those years ago ‚ô™ Jesus ‚ô™ Set us free ‚ô™ When he rose, he rose from shadow ‚ô™ ‚ô™ In a light the world had never seen ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And he stirred over death and victory ‚ô™ ‚ô™ He said, now you can live forever with me ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Jesus ‚ô™ Saved my soul ‚ô™ When he died for me ‚ô™ All those years ago ‚ô™ Jesus ‚ô™ Set us free This is Daniella. She has been a great friend of mine here Michelle, can you translate for me? Tell her, "thank you for looking after our darling daughter" My mum just says thank you for looking after me here. Oh, I didn't look after you. You can tell her that I think her daughter's an amazing flatmate. Wow, this food is amazing! This baptism thing, it isn't distracting you from your studies? No dad. In fact, since I became a Christian I feel I have more focus Well I'll certainly look forward to meeting these people in your church Yes, and Daniella will come too Oh, I'm just saying you will come to the baptism as well. So you have cooked this all by yourself? Yes I have tried to Really? We're proud of you darling Michelle, I just wanted to say that I'm looking forward to your baptism tomorrow so much I cannot tell you how encouraged I have been by you Sarah, these last three months have been the most memorable time in my life I left my home in China to come to a foreign place by myself I never expected that I would be so confused with many things, and really homesick But I realised that no matter where I go, my real eternal home is in heaven Because my Heavenly Father loves me so much He even sent His son to die on the cross for the cost of my sins To forgive all my sins To call me back to His arms I'm so thankful that my parents, university friends and flatmate will come to hear me share my testimony tomorrow I am so blessed Michelle, can I pray for you just now? Let me pray in English Gracious Lord, as we come to you now, we are full of joy and the sweetness of your grace and love, and I just want to thank you so much for rescuing Michelle from a life of darkness and sin. Thank you for her heart to serve you, for her friendly, sweet nature. Lord, we praise you that she has been such a blessing to many in this church. We pray that tomorrow, you may bless her in this baptism, a time to declare the great work that Jesus has done in her life. Speak to all the friends that come that do not know Jesus, including her flatmate and her mum and dad. And Lord, in all that takes place tomorrow and throughout Michelle's life, here in the UK and maybe back in China, may you go before her, guiding her footsteps, and using her mightily for the sake of your Name. Amen.
