NETFLIX PRESENTS Shh, Mr. Taat! See? Told you. What I like most in this world is money. And what I hate most is... teachers. Indonesian language. The thing is, I don't have any money. And my father is a teacher. I teach Indonesian language. My own son failed this subject... Good grief, Taat. In our village, I could never escape his shadow. Taat! So I needed to leave. I wanted to show him that I could be way more successful than merely a teacher. I was willing to do any kind of job as long as I could live in the city. Anything. So I wouldn't have to live in the village with Dad. -Seriously? -Yes! Wow, thanks a lot! I'm leaving. Alright! Hocus pocus! Abracadabra! But as it turned out, luck is not for everyone. Hey, dude! That time, I was really stuck. I had nowhere else to go. Except... to go back home. This is from your former students, sir. And also this, sir. From all of us. Last year's reunion, sir. Check this out, "Happy Birthday, Mr. Purnama." -Nice! -How is the spelling, sir? You still look young here, sir. When I see you guys on TV... Excuse me. Can I help you? Another former student of yours, sir? He is my son, Taat. Oh, no wonder he looks like you. It has been ten years. He's never home for the Eid holiday. If you guys ever have any children, you should... tell them to come home. Hi, guys! This time, I'm going to share ten tips to make money on the Internet. The easiest one is to make a vlog. Make videos... Prepare your materials... Right now, I'm doing a food review. So if you... I want to take you guys on a tour of my dad's kitchen. Look at the things behind me. Nothing, guys! That's it, that's all we have in the kitchen. Dude, why does the data run out so fast? You bought data for 5,000 rupiahs. Of course it runs out when you upload videos. ROMLI GUNAPRAJA EMPLOYMENT AGENCY Next. Sir. I'm looking for a job, sir. I thought you were looking for murtabaks. Next! Sir... My nephew is sick. I think he is the same age as your son. That's my brother. My brother is even worse, sir! He's severely ill. So skinny. This is nothing. Well, let me see your brother. But you have to hurry, I want to have the first Tarawih with my brother. Sure. Why are they so healthy looking? Aha! Wait! Come here! I need your help! Okay? You need to... Hey! Come here! You need to pretend to be my brother who is sick, weak and malnourished. Okay? Deal? -For 50,000, okay? -Damn! I was like this once. You must eat plenty of meat. And drink some milk! Here, have some milk. I will help you out. Do you have any skills? I usually work in the entertainment industry, sir. Being an MC for events, singing... He must have been energized because of the milk. Sir, I am serious. I can do any job. Any current job vacancies? WANT TO BECRUISE CREW? Now... Now... This is a good fit for me! -Fifty million rupiahs! -Kill me now. Don't die just yet. You need some money to apply for the job. But the salary is huge. You can bring a lot of money back home. The uniform looks cool, all your pictures will be taken overseas. Your parents will be proud. But I am not sure you can handle it. Oh, I know. Go to this address. They have an opening for a temporary job. You may be what they are looking for. If this goes well... I'll consider you for the cruise job. Alright. GUNUNG ASRI HIGH SCHOOL -Are you serious, sir? -Yes. Is this some kind of test? Yes, Sis. I’m just fetching my assignment. Yes, Sis. I will come home right away. Yeah... GUNUNG ASRI HIGH SCHOOL I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. This used to be my school. Where my father has been teaching... until now. He's always been a favorite among students and teachers. If I, his son, become a teacher here, it's best to stay far away from him. Can I help you, sir? Application for substitute teacher. If you have any documents, just put them right there. What about the application to admire you? Where should I put it? I’m the head of the administration office here, sir. Cheesy lines like that don't belong here. Try it on the streets. Take it easy. It was just a joke. There’s a huge difference between making a joke and being disrespectful. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. If I'd meant to be disrespectful, I would have done this. Here, take it! Sorry, that was an accident. I'll take it. I'll clean it up. Sorry, my bad. I didn't mean it. Disrespectful! Mayday! Ms. Rahayu. Calm down. Inhale. Exhale. Better? I'm Indah, the principal here. What’s your name, sweet boy? I'm Taat, Taat Pribadi. I’m applying for the substitute teacher vacancy, ma'am. Finally, an angel has arrived. I'm so thankful! I almost gave up. The class hasn't had a teacher for two weeks! Mr. Taat, please teach here for a month, okay? At least until after the Eid holiday. Because the real teacher can't make it. I can do that. What subject will I be teaching, ma'am? Art? Indonesian language? -History. -Moth... Say what? Math I can do, and history even more. Principal Indah, we can't do it this way. We still need to check his documents and background. We can't just hire him. Don't worry. I got this. Mr. Taat, can you start tomorrow? Yes, of course, ma'am! Ms. Rahayu, we need to arrange the teacher salary pick up. As usual, sweetheart. You need to get married soon! -Thank you, ma'am! -Sure. There's no diploma here. Please bring it tomorrow. Yes, ma'am. I heard that you are going to teach at school. Is that right? Don't bring dishonor upon us. DIPLOMA Here it is, ma'am. Excuse me. -Mr. Gagah? -Yes, miss? -Put it here. -Okay. Our order for the students has arrived. Mr. Manul, Mr. Purnama and I have put in our share. My phone is broken. -Let's prank him. -Good idea! Although teachers are annoying, students can be even more annoying. I'm surprised at how I behaved back then. If I had a choice, I wouldn't be teaching. I don't know how my father and the other teachers can stand it. Is this class XII IPS 1? It's over there, sir! Well done. Okay, everyone listen up. Principal Indah requested me to be your substitute teacher. -Good morning. -Good morning to... Ipang! That's the new teacher. Hurry up and sit down. What subject, sir? Carry on! I will pay you, but later. Keep your mouth shut for now. -When? -Later, when I get my paycheck. I want it before school is over. Or else, I'll rat you out using a megaphone. Okay, ready? Last time with Ms. Hera, we were at chapter seven. Okay then, you guys continue reading chapters eight through ten. And make a summary of it. If you have any questions, ask your seatmate. If you still don't get it, then you can ask me. Teachers encourage students from behind. Happy reading. You are in trouble, sir! Sir, my phone is broken! What do I do, sir? Why did you break her phone? I'll take a video of it, sir. Proof for compensation! You have to compensate. Hey, where are you going? This is such an old trick! Where is your friend, the one who took a video? Where is the phone you used to take the video? Where is the video? Let me delete it. Off you go! Let me to introduce myself. I’m Nelson Manulang. They call me Mr. Manulang or Mr. Manul. Taat Pribadi. Thank you, Mr. Taat. I owe you one. Don't mention it. I’m the one who wants to owe you something. Very funny, sir. Do you have 500,000 rupiahs? Seriously? -Yes, of course. -Of course I don't, sir. But, hold on. Maybe there are other teachers who can help you out. Come with me. Usually teachers always borrow money from each other. How about her? You mean Ms. Nirmala? Ms. Nirmala is the smartest one here. She teaches chemistry. Sometimes, she finds it hard to focus. But I guess that's the reason why I find her to be so... cute! Hey. I mean, can I borrow money from her? -Don't do that! -Why? -We should pity her. -Why should we? Goodness gracious! She's pregnant! Look! There’s a baby inside her belly. A husband at home. Are you crazy? Yes, she has a baby in her belly, but her husband isn't... You're the new teacher? Hold on, what did I want to do? Grade the assignments? Not spicy enough! Hot sauce... What's with you? Dear fellow teachers. The day after tomorrow is our payday. Yay! Isn’t she the administrator? She teaches mathematics, too. No teacher has ever dared to borrow any money from her. She has to support her little brother, both her parents are gone. Good afternoon. -Afternoon. -Mrs. Manggar, Mrs. Asri. Try borrow from Mr. Gagah. He is young, single, leads a simple life, and he likes to save his money. -Seriously? -Yeah, give it a try. Bro! -One moment. -Thank you, sir. Hear me out, Bro. It's about Mr. Purnama. The roof of our house is leaking, termites all over the place. Can I borrow some money? Mr. Purnama really does have a habit of not telling anyone when he needs help. But I don’t have that much money with me right now. I only have 50,000 rupiahs. That's enough! This is between us, though. If he finds out, it will be a problem. Yes, I got it. Fortunately, his retirement money will be available soon. What? Retirement money? -Didn't you know? -No. Mr. Purnama will retire soon. As per the new policy, Mr. Purnama will get... a hundred million rupiahs. A hundred... million? I thought you were inviting me to play along. Where's my money? You're taking too long to pay this small debt. Sometimes I can only wonder. WORK ON A CRUISE SHIP If I ask my father for money, will he give me any? Mr. Taat, I'm leaving now. Yes, ma'am! If you're not busy this weekend, maybe we can go out. Mr. Gagah! Yes, sir? Ms. Rahayu. You've brought the teachers' salaries? Why haven't you left? I’m waiting for Mr. Gagah. I want to talk to him for a minute. I'll take this and put it somewhere safe. Excuse me. Here’s the thing, Gagah. I can call you by your first name, right? I need some money to start a business. Dad’s retirement money is 50 million. The problem is he doesn’t trust me. He trusts you more. I get it. No problem. What's important is we both understand. I'll pay it back. Sorry, I don’t get it. What do you mean? This is a business opportunity, Bro. Here, listen up. Ms. Rahayu! -Are you okay? -We've been robbed! Chase them! Hurry! Thieves! Thieves! Hey! Wait up! Where are you going? Give it back! Gagah! Hey! Give it back! Where are you going, huh? Ouch! Give it back! Let go! Give it back! Give it back! Ouch! Hey! Run! Hurry! Hey! Thieves! Thieves! NURSE'S OFFICE LIBRARY Mr. Taat, you're the new teacher, correct? Why were you still at school when it happened? When everybody had already gone home. About that... I asked him to help me clean up the library, Officer. As well as showing him the ropes because he is new. I saw it with my own eyes, he tried hard to go after those thieves. Alright, I guess that’s it for now. Thank you. Thank you, sir. TEACHERS' LOUNGE Can the school committee be held responsible for this? I apologize for this incident. I'm sorry, Mr. Eko. I will find a solution as soon as possible, Mr. Eko. Mrs. Manggar, I'm sorry. You've just had a grandchild. Mr. Nelson, I'm sorry. You wanted to go home and help out your parents. Ms. Nirmala, I'm sorry. You are expecting a baby soon. Pardon me. My fellow teachers. Let's not lose our spirit. What we need to remember is, the students still need us. My fellow teachers, please don't worry. Ms. Rahayu and I, as witnesses, have already worked intensively with the police. We're sure that we will get our money back. We will. Alhamdulillah. This tempeh, if it was any thinner, I could see right through it. Taat, we have to be more concerned. I think you should find an extra job. I'll be busy with the investigation, Dad. Don’t give those teachers false hope. They are simple folk. What false hope, Dad? Words are powerful, Taat. Choose them wisely. I’m going to the mosque. LAUNDRY SERVICE - CAR WASH SERVICE TUTORING SERVICE Mr. Manul, can I join you? This? Are you sure? -You're not ashamed? -You aren't, are you? Mr. Manul! Mrs. Manggar. Five thousand each, sir. What's this, ma'am? Those are headbands. Oh, headbands. How do I put it on? Why would you wear it? Doesn't it look nice? Mrs. Manggar, it is prohibited to sell anything at school. I'm sorry, Ms. Rahayu, I don't know what else to do. I know. We're all struggling, but rules were made for a reason. If you want to sell, do it at the back of the school. I will ask for permission. That sounds good, miss. I'm so sorry. Ms. Rahayu! Don't be too uptight. You should pity Mrs. Manggar. If the other teachers follow her lead... Also the students... What will this school be, sir? A market? Excuse me. Some kids wanted to major in science, but their grades weren't good enough. They ended up in social studies, and borrow science assignments then try to do them. Next time, don't let them do it. Like that fatso, Bimbim. He studies so seriously, how can I stop him? You're his teacher. Get a grip. Mr. Taat! Come on! You can splash me anywhere you want... But never my precious watch! There you go, be good. Sir. So what did the police say about the investigation? -They said it might be an inside job. -Huh? The thieves were able to open the administration office door. Ms. Rahayu said she was the only one who had the key. No way. Mr. Gagah also has a copy of the key. But, on that day, he hurt his head trying to stop the thieves. So, it couldn't be him either. Do you know where Mr. Gagah lives? Why? What do you want? Mr. Taat. I didn’t know that you and Mr. Gagah were this close. What about you? You two seem really close. I'm just here to find out how long Mr. Gagah will be absent. So I'll know if I should look for a substitute teacher. Good day to you, sirs. Good day to you, too. I guess that's all, Gagah. I better get going. Good day. Are you feeling better? Thank goodness, I am. -I’ll bring you some water. -I'm good. It's okay. I'll go to the kitchen. You think you are clever at hiding things. I saw what you did just now! Confess! What did you see? Come on! Give me that! Ouch! Gosh! It hurts! -Confess! -What are you two doing? -Stop it, you two! -That... -You guys are like little boys fighting. -He is the culprit! You thief! It hurts. Don't act like you know nothing! What do you mean, "thief"? I was about to hand over the letter to you. I wanted to have it delivered. RESIGNATION I don't want to accept this. I have made up my mind. What's this? A police officer stopped by. I just remembered, one of the thieves had a tattoo. So I tried to draw it. If someone like Mr. Gagah gives up... how many teachers can we expect to last after the Eid holiday? And if we don’t do anything... maybe no one will be teaching anymore after the Eid al-Adha. Maybe this is also a sign for you. Are you planning to be a teacher forever? Once... someone pulled me out of the darkness. And I think it's time for me to do the same by helping others. This is my world. Hey. It's almost Maghrib. Would you like to... break the fast at my house? I'd love to! Little brother! Do this later on. Let's prepare the food now. We're breaking the fast with Mr. Taat. Come on, hurry up! -What are you doing here? -What about you? This is my house. So you and... Little brother! -One moment! -She doesn’t know anything, does she? Stop disrupting my life! Siblings? This is going to be a problem. Is this tea? It looks so clear, like for a finger bowl. Help yourself, sir. You two don't seem close. But you do look alike. Why is that? Is it because of the age gap? It's a long story, sir. I'll be offended if you don't tell me. Who knows? I might come up with a solution. I'm a good listener. You can tell me. When I was ten, my mother passed away due to an accident. Two years after that, my father remarried and Ipang was born. Not long after that, Father's business went bankrupt and... he ran away and left us. Ipang’s mother was about to sell Ipang to a trafficker, sir! I couldn't accept that! So ever since then, we’ve been living together on our own. Thank you for listening. I feel better now. Sorry, I got carried away. Eat up, sir. What’s your problem? I’ve paid my debt to you. You did pay up, but you’re a teacher. So what? You have to understand, it takes a lot to be a teacher. No genuine teacher acts like you do. At times, you have no idea what you're talking about. Ipang, go iron some clothes. Sir... About what I said, keep it a secret, okay? Oops. I just posted about it on a gossip account. You! I thought you were serious. You always make jokes. Not bad, I got 500 rupiahs for it. Watch me. Wait. I'll show you another magic trick. What is this? The index finger. -What about this one? -The thumb. Now count to three. One... two... three! Finger heart! Enough joking, let's finish this first. Taat, the job interview fee is 200,000 rupiahs. The passport is 350,000 rupiahs. Medical check-up for 1.5 million. Visa is 1.5 million. When can you bring the money? Hello, Taat? You're not dead, right? No, sir. Sorry, I currently have a bit of a situation, sir. Okay, look, my office will be closed a week before the Eid holiday. Bring the money before then. Sir? Is it true, that you fought off two thugs and you lost? The teachers lost all their salaries? Yes. I'm trying to find the culprit. Can we be of any help, sir? What do you think about this drawing? My father used to say that seeing students making an effort is something priceless. Today, I understood what he meant by that. I can't believe that my students care that much about their teachers. Even when I have not given them my best yet. I described what I remembered. And they all tried to draw the tattoo. What's important is that you can explain your argument and elaborate on it. -Come with me for a moment. -Understood? -Sir! Wait, I'm still teaching! -I want to show you something. -What is it? -Does this tattoo look familiar? No. Is there anyone who knows much about tattoos? Mr. Manul once told me that a relative in his village is a tattoo artist. Mr. Manul... Mrs. Manggar! Excuse me, ma'am. Have you seen Mr. Manul? I think he went to the nurse's office, sir. With Ms. Nirmala. -Thanks, ma'am! -Okay then. What, I'm going too? Come on, the school bell rang a moment ago. -I haven't dismissed the class. -They'll be fine. Ms. Nirmala? Ms. Nirmala, what happened? My rice crackers, I forgot to take them out. Calm down, Ms. Nirmala. Let me get you a drink. Since your relative is a tattoo artist, can you ask him about this? What tattoo is this? I know that tattoo. Here, Ms. Nirmala. It looks like mung bean. Mung bean sounds delicious, no? Three months ago, I divorced my husband... because of his gambling problem. And he was caught cheating on me. Turns out, he also owes a lot of money to Pak Le. But he ran away. That tattoo belongs to Pak Le's group of debt collectors. What will I do? I should just stop being pregnant. There's no father, and the mother is not ready. Ms. Nirmala! There's no money either! How can you even cancel a pregnancy? Sorry. Let's go. Ms. Nirmala. If you're left to deal with this on your own, then go for it. If you need any help, I am willing to help. Pak Le. Is that chocolate for her? Why are you putting it back in? Give it to her before it melts. Shut up. What a wuss! Saulina! Saulina! -Yes, sir? -I have an assignment for both of you. I will give extra credit if you guys can complete it. Ask Ipang about the assignment. I’ve already explained it to him. So? So the assignment is about... We're making... I think my ride is here. This is for you. Thanks. You're welcome. Mr. Manul, if we follow the debt collectors from Ms. Nirmala’s house... -maybe they can lead us to the thieves. -You’re joking around, Mr. Taat. How are we going to follow them? You got me there. We've got no motorcycles. Whose car is this? Whoa, don't even think about it. This is the cleric’s car. -So what? -So don't do it! It's been entrusted to me to be cleaned. He's studying the Quran. No. If we can get the evidence and catch those culprits, they'll stop bothering Ms. Nirmala. Whose car is this, Mr. Manul? It’s a long story, Ms. Nirmala. You didn’t steal this, did you? Of course not. There's no way I'd steal. I borrowed this car. I haven't told the owner though. Look over there! Anyone home? Why did they have to ruin my rice crackers? I was going to sell them tomorrow. They're leaving! Start the car! Ms. Nirmala, please step out of the car. Let me come with you. Hurry! Pull over. Let's just park here and wait. Mr. Taat, nothing is happening. Let's chat a little. Ever since you started teaching at school, Ms. Rahayu seems a bit different. Different how? You see, I go to the restroom a lot. And lately, I see her there, fixing her hijab. And then, yesterday in the nurse's office, I also noticed... -Although it was hard to notice... -What? She was actually wearing lipstick! I think it’s better for you to share. What’s going on between you two? Nothing really. Give me your phone. There must be something there. -Knock it off. -Here's the phone. MY RAHAYU Hey, focus! My Rahayu! Why is she calling? -Yes, miss? -Ipang just texted me. He said he was working on a history assignment at Saulina's. -Is that true, sir? -Yes, I did give him an assignment. Oh, okay then. By the way, I have given the tattoo drawing to the police. Actually, they already know about it since Gagah gave them his sketch. Now they are investigating the connection between that tattoo guy and Pak Le. So Pak Le is being investigated? He runs a co-op but that's just a front for extortion and scams. And there have been many victims. But Pak Le is backed by powerful people. That's why it's difficult for the police to go after him. ANOTHER FARMER FROM GUNUNG ASRI MISSING AFTER BEING INDEBTED TO PAK LE Tomorrow during lunch break, can you come to the library? I want to show you something. Sure, I'll call you back later. Hello? Mr. Taat! Well... Let's go! There's something fishy in there. We have to go in. How do we get in? Oh dear! This guy has lost his mind! Hey, dude! -Dude. -What is it? What do you think you're doing? Oh no, how can I explain this to the cleric? One knock will fix it! How about Ms. Nirmala? If she goes inside, they will recognize her. Just go in, I'll be alright. Go on. Hello, how long will it take to fix the bumper? Because I have VIPs in the back. One moment. You two just chill here, I'm going to go around and look for clues. Don't let them get suspicious. Oh, it's just the bumper. Excuse me, where's the toilet? Over there! Alright! AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Had I known how precious that ring was at that exact moment... I would have solved my problems. Unfortunately back then, I had no clue. Hey, what are you doing? There are still some dents. Tan. Yes, sir? My handkerchief. Don't touch the box. Careful! There you go. You see this guy? This is Pak Le. If I'd known how scary he was... I would have gone back to the city. But again, at that time, I had no idea. Because I'm a fool. You want to know how evil he is? You see that old guy? I feel sorry for him. His mistake was accidentally touching Pak Le's sacred ring! Just put it here first. Maybe next week before Sahur, we can move it. Yes, sir! It's in the usual spot, I have locked it and put on the "Do Not Enter" sign. How much, dude? Three hundred thousand rupiahs. Wait a sec. How should we pay 300,000? I’m done, I'm never going back there again! But we have to go back because I know where they keep the money. And I already have a plan. But of course it's impossible to go there on my own, right? There must be a distraction. If Ms. Rahayu agrees, then I'm in. Exactly! I was just thinking the exact same thing! Where’s the logic in that? So, at our school, if Ms. Rahayu is the one making plans, everything works out well. School events, graduations, field trips. Everything she planned went smoothly! But this is not a trip to the planetarium. Fine! I will ask her. Sir? -Mr. Taat. -Yes? Look at this. There’s a co-op near the square called Sejahpasti. The founder is Mr. Santoso, or as we know him, Pak Le. Ms. Rahayu... Actually, I already went to his garage. And our money, I mean, the school’s money is there. -It could be our evidence. -How could you be so reckless? Mr. Manul, Ms. Nirmala and I need your help to get the evidence. Mr. Taat. This is the history assignment written by Ipang and Saulina. HISTORY OF MARIJUANA I got in trouble with Saulina’s parents. My goodness, Ipang. They are members of the school committee. They're wondering what their kids are being taught in school. Actually, ma'am... this is an important assignment. Because in order to... I don't need an explanation, sir. I’m already stressed out because the government educational assistance fee is delayed. Where should I get the money to pay the teachers? They’re going to supervise your class. -Ms. Rahayu, please arrange it, okay? -Yes, ma'am. -Please sort this out, Mr. Taat. -Yes, ma'am. To avoid drugs, we need to understand... HISTORY OF INDONESIA Ms. Rahayu wouldn't help us out if Ipang failed his presentation. So, now I ought to learn how to teach properly. The first compound has reacted with the second compound... Mathematically, that stationary orbit which moved away from the core will have the energy... Language is a reflection of our personality. If you use negative language when communicating in social media, later, it will affect you in a negative way. What will you do then? Now, I want to ask you a question. Who here has more than one social media account? I do, sir! -What is it for? -Isn't it exciting? Sure. Students. He always loves his students. But our language is the language of... Indonesia! I have my own teaching method. Who am I? Mr. Taat! Who signed the proclamation of independence? It wasn't me, sir! It wasn't me. Stop laughing at me. Shut up. I'm stressed out as it is. The parents are coming tomorrow and I am doomed. Actually, I have a presentation ready for tomorrow. After the presentation, you can fill in. Consider this as an apology from me... Mr. Taat. "Mr. Taat"? What happened to you? -Did your sister tell you to call me that? -No. I just think that you deserve an apology from me. HISTORY OF MARIJUANA So that's how drugs have historically being abused to ruin a nation. That is all from me and Saulina. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused. And now, we'd like to welcome our teacher! Give me ten young men without drugs, then I will change the world! Finally, Ms. Rahayu has agreed to help us. But only if we thoroughly prepare for this operation... as we are facing some dangerous criminals. After school, we prepare and practice, we can't afford to fail. But our main responsibility of teaching cannot be ignored. GARAGE BLUEPRINT Don't click the wrong button. Click this one and talk. Like this? Hello? Time's up. We need to be faster. Let's try it again. You need to take a break first. Maybe we should just go in together. We can find another cutter. Okay? You teachers are great. Awesome. -Why so? -You work so hard, selflessly, and dedicate your lives to the students. Awesome. Back then, I spent more time here than in the classroom. I was always curious about what was out there. Outside school, outside the village, I even thought about going overseas. For me, I just do what's in front of me. Aren’t you tired of it? Of course I am. Sometimes it gets boring, and I feel like screaming. -Just to relieve myself. -Then scream. I'm bored! I'm tired! I want to sleep! I want to go on a vacation! I want to be hugged! What? That slipped out. Hey. Bro, those used cars over there, who do they belong to? Yours? Used cars? Where? Over there. I have one I want to sell. I'll bring it over and we'll fix the price. What do you say? -Okay, wait here. -Okay. Let's go. Let's have a look. The cutter, please. Hey! Where is it? MT, MR, this is MN, hello. MT, MT, MR, come in. MT, MR, this is MN-- Shh, Mr. Taat! See? Told you. MR, MT, the truck is leaving! MN, we are inside the truck. MM, come in, MM! Are you trying to trick me? How dare you? Where's my walkie-talkie? Here, just use mine. MN, come in, MN. MT, come in, MT! We are out of the crate. But the door is locked from the outside. Can you find a way to stop this truck? How should I stop it? Chasing the truck is hard enough. We have to find a way. MT, MR? I can see the truck now. MT, MR, I have successfully passed the truck. What do I do now? MN, now drive the car slowly, slowly to the middle of the road, okay? MM! Where have you been all this time? Why didn’t you answer? Now, MN, just drive the car slowly, okay? To the middle of the road, okay? Stay focused. Ma'am, can you move aside? Don't block the road. -Move aside, sir? -Yes, move it! -You want me to move aside? -Yes! Yes, sir! A lot of people tell me to move aside every day. Just like my husband during the Eid holiday... During the family photo session, I was told to move aside! While on my job, I was also told to move aside by my superiors. I get it, being a woman my age, I have to give in all the time! Always giving in! I'm told to move aside not only literally, but also philosophically, sir. Do you even know how that feels? Being a woman my age and as a wife, I feel that I always have to move aside for my husband's sake. So, you want me to move aside? Like this? Have I moved aside enough? Enough, ma'am! Enough! -Are you satisfied, sir? Are you? -I'm so sorry, ma'am! Crazy gibbering lady. If you haven't found it before I break my fast... your mother, and your mother... I'll chop them up! All your family will be dead meat! GUNUNG ASRI HIGH SCHOOL Stealing from a thief! CLEANING IN PROGRESS NURSE'S OFFICE LIBRARY It should be 540 million rupiahs. How much is it? Almost a billion rupiahs. Okay. Let's call the police. Wait a minute, what if we get accused of stealing? How about I keep the money at Mr. Purnama’s place? Okay? Ms. Nirmala... Alright? Just keep it here, sir. It's much safer. Who’s guarding the library? My gosh. -Why don’t you be the security as well? -She was once. Yes? Hello, Taat? Today’s the last day. The ship is about to set sail. I have the money, sir. Fifty million in total. I'll bring it over. Mr. Taat! We have a gift for you! HOW TO DRAW BETTER So you can draw better. But this is more like an insult, no? Thank you, guys. You're welcome, sir. Isn't it time for class, sir? Yes, it is. I can explain. I just want to take my share. Mr. Purnama’s retirement money. But the lock is broken, so I wanted to keep it somewhere else. Liar. I mean it. I'm not taking all of it, just the 50 million. Mr. Manul, Ms. Nirmala, call the police. Ipang, go back to your classroom. How can I trust you now, Taat? I won’t stop you. It’s not my job to catch a thief. The police were here before we even called them. But why are they arresting us instead? It’s impossible, sir. You must be mistaken. We haven’t found the last one, sir. To the teacher named Taat Pribadi, please proceed to the school yard right away! Taat Pribadi! Sis! -Get him away! -Sis! Shut up! Get lost! Please take care of the students. Move it. Ms. Nirmala... Miss, it's not you, right? It's not you, right? Principal Indah came by this morning. She told me your diploma is fake. But that’s not the only reason why she came here. What's in the bag? Dear God. Dad! -I have to call the police. -Dad, I can explain. Dad! Please listen to me this once, Dad. Dad. I'm carrying this much money with me... I could go anywhere I wanted to, Dad. But why do you think I came here instead? Dad! You listen to everyone! Everyone! Everyone but your own son! Am I right? Always! This is not stealing, Dad. This is the teachers' salaries, and your retirement money. The other teachers and I have worked hard to take it back from the thieves. I needed help. But you were so distant. You've always been distant. I never made it in the city, Dad. Never. Not that I didn't want to go home during the Eid holiday. I was too embarrassed. There was nothing I could offer to make you proud of me. No money. No diplomas. No titles. All this time, I thought you cared more about your students than your own son. But after... being a teacher myself... I understand now. I want to apologize, Dad. For embarrassing you. Forgive me, Dad. Forgive me, Dad. Please forgive me, too. Please forgive me, son. Good day! Fake cops, sir! Turns out they are all fake cops. I saw a tattoo on one of their arms! The tattoo we drew last time! Bimbim followed them. They weren't taken to the police station. Hello, Ipang? Mr. Taat! They were taken inside the big house! Bim, don't block the view! This is in Telaga Mas area, Mr. Taat. MY RAHAYU Ms. Rahayu? I can't believe it. I can't believe that teachers can become thieves, Mr. Taat. Let them go! I’ll give the money back! Let's make this simple. I’ll consider the money you stole as a loan. Now I want it back in one hour. Plus 100 percent interest. For every minute you're late... I'll kill one of your friends. Principal Indah? Sir, where's my share? My job is done. I have to go pay for my house, or else I will-- Later. Sit down. But, I... Sit down! Why? Ms. Rahayu, what do you know? You know nothing! It's been one hour. Tan. Principal Indah, please! Principal Indah, please! One... two... three... four... five. How much do you think you're worth? Nobody cares if you die. Pak Le! Bring him upstairs! Where's my money? The interest? About that, I'm here to negotiate. Even if we put together all the teachers' salaries, it still won't be enough. -Kill one of them. -Wait! I can double your money. Fivefold! Or even tenfold! List of all the teachers' salaries in this region. I got it from one of the parents. The National Education Supervisor. What do you think? I have the brain, you have the manpower. They're stupid, but useful. Why the sudden change of heart, Mr. Teacher? I'm not a real teacher. I just want to be rich. Then what do you suggest we do to these teachers? Don’t leave any witnesses. Trap them somewhere, then burn the building! Or drown them in a river, cut the rope off the bridge. Take your pick. You smart, smart man! Do we have a deal? Deal. Wait... Where's my ring? -I'll throw the ring! -No, don't! Let them go! Let them go, quick! Please, sir! It's my ring. Please don't throw it away! -I'll throw it away! -It's my ring! Please! That's my amulet. Please give it back. Sir! My ring fell down! Why are you all going at once? Just one person! Morons! Come on, guys! Let's go over there! There! That's the ladder to the roof! We have no choice but to go there! So all your fortune comes from this ring? -Go away! -Please don't, sir, please! Please, sir! That's the fake one, right? That's the real one... Go after them! Miss! Are you okay, miss? What are you kids doing here? We want to help the teachers, miss. You punks! What are you guys doing here? Back off! We're helping you. Give it to them! Good grief, Principal Indah! The bag! Get the bag! No! This is for... Sir, Ipang is up there! Where do you think you're going? Where's my ring? Hey! Don't you dare run from me! -You punk! Come here! -Ipang. Where is he, sir? Give me back my ring! Ipang! -Where's my ring? -Here! Here it is. Ipang! Ipang! How dare you take my amulet? Pak Le! He has nothing to do with this! Let him go! Where's my money? Open it! Hurry! Consider it your first salary from me. Your first task is to find a way to get us out of here. Let Ipang go! Relax, I am backed by powerful people. Is this really my salary? What if you're lying? You think that amount of money means a lot to me? Hurry up! Or I'll kill this kid! Okay! Be patient, sir, be patient! Didn't I tell you? What I love most is money. I can also see that this guy thinks the way I think. The question is... do I want to become someone like him? My money! This is Taat. Thank you, officer. If it wasn’t for Mr. Purnama who contacted our commander... maybe we would’ve been too late. HAPPY EID AL-FITR TO THE STUDENTS OF GUNUNG ASRI HIGH SCHOOL And as per the tradition in our school, a teacher who is retiring will plant a tree within the school vicinity... so that we may always remember his dedication. Here you go, sir. Thank you, Mr. Purnama. So what's your plan now? Dad is lending me his retirement money. Give me a call once in a while. What about a few times instead? This was the point where I had to make a decision about my life. And to be honest, it was really hard for me to leave all of this... to leave them behind. But I knew... I had to go. PRINCIPAL RAHAYU PARAMITHA, B.ED. Are you finally going to do it? It's been four years. I know, I'm going to do it now, miss. Hurry up! Nirmala. When can I see your parents? I want to ask for your hand. Be patient, dear. A package for you, miss. DIPLOMA NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION -Congratulations, Taat. -Thank you. Evidently, the meaning of success differs for everyone. I learned that a teacher is not always someone who's older... or the ones at school. A teacher can come into your life in unexpected ways. So, that's the story of how I became a teacher. So, can we be good teachers, sir? Have you two been listening to a word I've said? Listen. To this day, I never know whether I can be a good teacher or not. What's important is, we remember why we're doing this. That's it. -Mr. Taat, it's time for class. -Okay. Noted, sir. And remember... Stay crazy awesome.
