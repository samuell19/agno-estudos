Sure, you married her. But did you ever love her? Of course, I loved her. I told you. "Loved?" As in, past tense. Slip of tongue, babe. I meant; I love her. Are you trying to convince me or yourself? Nothing like that, Niru. Lata is different, you're different. As in, she's your true love and I'm just your side chick, right? Or maybe I'm just a fantasy, Something that Lata couldn't give you in bed. That's such nonsense, Niru. You know that I love you. My little dumbo. I'm putting this off. These songs feel as old as you are. Very boring. Oh, really? Oh, really? You want me to prove it to you right now? No! Ram, no.

You just did what girls like you do for money. I want to ask Ram that I want to ask Ram that How could he bring someone like you in my house? What was going on here? How did Ram fall from there? Up there, Ram just lost his balance. He couldn't hold himself. What were you doing up there? What were you doing up there? He was trying to catch me. Why don't you just say that You and Ram were having wild and lusty sex all over the house? Lata ji, this is not how you think it is. Ram and I weren't having a casual affair. This is not an affair. This is just Ram's lust And your jackpot. But why? He couldn't find someone or... Lata ji I'm not a call girl. That's the word. I just didn't want to say it. You're wrong. You're wrong. I am wrong? And you're not at fault? I said sorry to you. Keep that to yourself. I'm just trying to understand What did he see in you that he... Love. Really? Look at yourself. What do you have? Looks? Class? Style? Sexy body? What would make Ram fall in love with you? What's so special in you? I don't know. But Ram really loves me. He loves me a lot. He loves me a lot. Does Govind know? And Ram's colleagues? No. Who's calling? At this hour? Do you have other lovers? It's my mother. Does your mother know about all this? No. Then let's tell her now. Lata ji, please. Lata ji, please. - Give me the phone. - Please, please. Please. Please. Is your mother involved in all this? My mother doesn't know about any of this. You must be thinking that I'm angry at you, right? I'm not angry. Actually, I feel sorry for you. You know why? I see a lot of girls like you in my clinic. Some even younger than you. Some even younger than you. You know the tragedy of us women? Each of us thinks, "My husband isn't like this." We never learn. Do we? That, men will be men. You're an idiot. You thought that now your life is set. Ram Varma proposed you. But you know what the truth is? Ram trapped you. Just to fulfil his damn fantasies. Do you still think that Ram truly loves you? Yes. Ram loves me. More than me? Ram likes you a lot. He keeps complimenting you. He respects you, Lata ji. I know that. But he doesn't love you. How dare you comment on our life? Just because a man slept with you You think he loves you? That's not love, you fool. That's not love, you fool. That's called lust. I know the difference between love and lust. If this weren't love, it wouldn't have lasted so long. How long has it been? Six months? Four. You think four months is a long time? Ram and I have been married for 20 years. 20 years! That was marriage. This is love. I'm amazed at your audacity. If someday, Ram finds someone else And he throws you away, What then? I don't know about the future. But I am his present. And no one else. Not even you. Not even you. You're saying that to me? In my house? Be grateful That I've been kind to you. Anyone else in my place, would've killed you by now. If I were in your place, I wouldn't stay with a man who loves someone else And not me. Give me your phone. - Your mother should know what you're doing. - Ma'am, no. Ma'am, please. Now she will decide. Give me your phone! No ma'am, please! Please don't drag my mother into this! I'll just go away! I'll go away. What happened now? Your love disappeared? As per convenience? If Ram really loves me, he'll call me for sure. And if this was his lust, He wouldn't have to worry about me. You've got 10 minutes. Pack your bags and leave. Don't ever come here again. Ease your head. Easy, easy, Ram. Lata... Why... Why did you do this, Ram? Why? I'm sorry, Lata. I'm sorry. Didn't expect this from you, Ram. What did I do wrong, Ram? Did I make a mistake? Somewhere in our marriage? No, Lata. This is not your fault. What do you see in that girl, Ram? I don't know. It's just... When I'm with her, I... I'm so happy. So happy. Ma'am. My bag. Don't let her go, Lata, please. Don't let her go. Don't let her go, Lata, please. Please. Wait. You're not in your senses. You need sleep. Take some rest, okay? Lata, Niru... Niru is pregnant. It's my child. I'm going to be a father. You're not in your senses. I want... I want Niru to be... The mother of my baby. I want her to be my... To be my... my wife. Ma'am! Ma'am, please! Ma'am! Ma'am, please, ma'am. Please don't hurt him. I'll leave him for good. Please. Please don't hurt him. I promise. Ram will never see me again. Niru Please, don't be angry at Lata ji. All this is too difficult for her. Lata ma'am, really loves you. Niru... So, I'm leaving. I'm sorry. Don't go. I need you. Lata, please. Please let Niru stay. I beg of you, Lata. I'm so sorry, Lata. Please forgive me. Forgive me. How many months? Two months. Who is your doctor? You. Relax, relax. Are you okay? Keep it straight. Keep it straight. Just two minutes. That's it. I examined you? I examined you? For a pregnancy test? Actually... I wanted an abortion. Then? What did I say? After a month, come for a scan. And bring the baby'sfather with you. I'll talk to him. I'll try to convince him to keep the baby. Hmm? Next! You're carrying... My husband's baby. And I... Stopped you from getting an abortion. All of this that happened. All of this... ...was actually my own fault? You stay here Nirosha. Ram is yours. Ram and I... We'll mutually file for divorce. Ma'am. Ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am. It's- It's okay. Ma'am, can I get you some water? I'm fine. I'll get it for you, ma'am. I don't mind some coffee, please. Okay. Yes, Mom. Yes, Niru, you called? No, it was a mistake. Okay, okay. No problem. I'll be back home next week... Our life is about to change. How? Ma'am, your coffee. Where are you going? We have to take Ram to the hospital, right? Govind will come. He'll bring an ambulance. If you get network, call an ambulance yourself. At least wait till Govind bhai is back. You said it yourself. "If I were in your place, I wouldn't stay with a man who loves someone else and not me." Then why should I wait? But ma'am, you're also a doctor. Gynaecologist. Not an orthopaedic surgeon. Ma'am, please. Ma'am, please. Please stay back. Please. We'll meet next month. In my clinic. Bring the baby's father with you. I'll advise him on marriage. Sir told me to go to the city, late at night. I reached here in the morning. This Niru... Uh, Niru madam was telling him...
