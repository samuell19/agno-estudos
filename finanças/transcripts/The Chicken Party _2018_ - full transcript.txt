That's awesome. All right, so over here, we have a name tag station. So if you just write down your name, stick it on and then come on in to the party. Great. - Hi, ladies. Welcome. - Okay, all right. James. - Yeah? - Everything's good? - Yeah. - All right, cool. Um, okay then, all right. Um, so hello, everyone. First of all, merry Christmas. Thank you, all, so much for coming tonight. It really means a lot to us. I know how traveling is. There's like so much to do and so little time, so we really appreciate, all of us, that you came out tonight to our little chicken party. Also, if anyone's concerned, at the end of the night, I can call cabs for people, to take you back to your hotels, safe and sound. Um, yeah, so that's about that. The Chicken Party, let me tell you a little bit about it. The Chicken Party, for us, is about meeting international friends and learning about each other's cultures. So the agenda for tonight, we'll do introductions. We'll introduce ourselves, and you guys can introduce yourselves. Then we'll do dinner. We're having chicken, by the way. And then, after that, we'll play some games, and at the end of the last game, I hope we all get each other's contact info, and, um, become long and lasting friends. So yeah, that's about that. Introductions, why don't I start? My name is Samantha. I'm the co-founder of The Chicken Party. Sounds kind of silly to say. I come from like a rich family. So this whole gated compound actually belongs to us. But it's just me and my friends who live here now, which gives us this opportunity to do these fun little gatherings. I've only been to eight countries, but I hope to see the whole world before I die. Yeah, so, uh, this is Karla here. Yeah, anyway, um, okay, and this is Sarah. She's my closest friend, and she's the other co-founder of The Chicken Party. - Hey, everyone. - Hi. - Hello. - And this is Audrey. That's David, over there. This is James. - Hi. - And that is Bryan. - Merry Christmas! - He is such a kidder. Yeah, so, uh, that's us. Now I'd love it if you guys would introduce yourselves. Just say your name and where you're from and, uh, maybe what your dreams are and what you're doing in America. So go for it, just stand up. Give it a go. Anyone? - Okay. - Yeah, go for it, great! - Hello, hi, everyone. My name is Cindy. I was born in Costa Rica. I lived there only with my mother. My father and brother died a long time ago, and, um, my mother, she works very hard. And she's the one who has encouraged me to travel and to see the world. She is my hero. I have been to so many places, and I have seen so many unique things, but this is the first time I've ever been invited to a chicken party, so thank you. I have come to America just to travel. And so far, my trip has been good. So thank you so much for having me here. Thanks. - Hello. Um, uh, my name is Miel. And, uh, this is my best friend Rina. Uh, uh, uh, Rina, uh, doesn't speak English very good, so I will introduce ourselves. Okay, um, we are both still in school. We go to same university. And we met freshman year. She is very kind and funny and is studying mathematics. And I am study business. We both wanted to come to Los Angeles to go to Disneyland. - Ah, yes. - Oh, have you gone yet? Was it everything you hoped for? - Ah, ah, no, not yet. We will go tomorrow. - Oh! - Aww! Oh, you're gonna love it. - Yes, we know. We both love Disney movies. - Ah, who doesn't? By the way, I love your sweaters. They're so cute. - Ah, thank you. Thank you. - Have Rina introduce herself in Korean. - Oh, okay, ah. - Huh? - Oh. - Hello. - Hi.

My name is Koume Watanabe. And this is my little sister, Sakura. She speaks a little English, but she's acting shy right now. We're from Tokyo. This is our first time in America. We're here, because we're celebrating her 21st birthday. - Oh, happy birthday! - Happy birthday. - Oh thank you. You're welcome. - Her birthday was actually four days ago. And, uh, oh, we went to Disneyland. It was really fun. Um, Miel? You guys are really going to love it. Oh, we did a lot of shopping. Walked around L.A., lots of walking. - Clubbing. - Ah, yes, yes. - Clubbing. - We went clubbing, last night. Best vacation ever. But all the great things must come to an end. We're leaving tomorrow. - Oh no. - Oh, stay longer. - I wish we could. There's just so much to see. I wish we could stop the time and enjoy everything. But I hope we will become friends tonight, and I hope one day you guys will come to Japan. - We will show you around. - Aw, thank you, guys. - You girls are so cute. Well, thank you all so much for introducing yourselves. I hope we all become good friends. Yeah, let The Chicken Party now begin. - Yeah! - Woo! - So, let me get this straight. You've traveled all of Central America and South America, right? - Right. - When do you have time to watch movies? - Hmm, I don't actually. I think I've seen like three that I could remember. - What? How could you do that to yourself? Please tell me you've at least seen Dawn of the Dead, right? - No. - You know, I took French when I was in high school. But I don't think I remember any of it. - I want to hear it. - Um, let's see, um... No, never mind. - Oh yeah, yeah. - I can't say it out loud. - Come. Come. - Go. - What do you say? - Don't look at me. I don't know French. - Hey, I speak French. - Oh yeah? - I know very little. - Okay, say something then. - Oh, uh, well, let's see. - Okay. That's all the French I know. - It's good, it's good. - Thanks. - Do you know what you just said? - Oh, nope. - That, that, that's good. Brice, he can't even say one sentence in English. Uh, no. - It's good French. - Good French? - Yeah. - Mostly, a little bit. - How's the chicken? - It's good. It's good. - It's good. - You don't, you don't try it? - Mm, don't really have an appetite right now. - Oh, can I have it? - Sure. - The Thing or Return of the Living Dead? - Mm, no to both. - What do you do with your free time? - I travel. - Hey, Miel. - Oh, yes, hi. - This is for you. And, um, these are also for you. These are like gloves. It's an American thing where you put them on so that you don't get your hands dirty, you know, while you're eating, yeah. - Ah, I see, thank you. - So I was hoping to pick your brain about Korea, because, um, I'm planning to make it my next trip, I think. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh my God. - Yeah? - One of the Halloween movies, right? - Mm, not that I can remember. - Come on. - Okay, so the guy who, so he starts walking to the lake, and he's got the briefcase, and, uh, uh... Dang it, no, wait, I think it was a river. I think he might've been walking to a river. I can't remember. I'm so sorry. I can't remember my own joke. That's really embarrassing. Oh, dang it. No , sorry. You know, I wish my friend Jimmy was here, because he remembers everything. - Hi, ladies. - Hi. - Hi. - Oh, uh, we already shook hands. Yeah. - Yeah? - Um, yeah, only Sakura, not me. - Oh. - That's very rude. - I'm sorry. That, that was very rude. I'm sorry about that. I'm, I'm just a little nervous when it comes to meeting people. I am sorry. - It's okay. So what are you, um, interested in? - Oh well, thanks for asking. Actually, I'm, uh, I'm interested in, well, video games. I really like video games, all sorts of games, but God, like RPGs, like, uh, you know, like Skyrim, The Witcher, Fallout 4, you know. I also really like, uh, like the BioWare games, like Mass Effect and, you know, things like that, little bit more turn-based, not really my thing, but I do like them. Final Fantasy VI and VII, I don't know if you guys know that's Japanese. Oh, and, you know, like, uh, I can't remember anymore, what? - No, that was funny. - I also like Oddworld games, too. I don't know if you guys know about those. But Oddworld Inhabitants, they make, uh, you know, like, Abe's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath. Some people say, critics don't like it, but I liked it a lot. Oh, actually, I just bought a brand-new Nintendo Switch, and I have barely even played it. Like, I don't know. I mean, if you guys want to, we can play it afterwards or something, at my place. - Did you guys eat chicken already? - It's not far away. - Chicken? - What? No, I'm, I'm, uh, no. - But you have the gloves on. - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I guess I just, uh, I don't know. I mean, I kinda have a little bit of a thing with germs. You guys were wearin' them, so I figured I should wear some, too. - It looks good on you. It's good. - Thanks, James. - Yeah. - Have you seen The Shining? - Mm, mm-mm. - The Descent? Saw? - Mm-mm. - American Psycho? The Ring, both versions? The Others? Scream? - No. - Invasion of the Body Snatchers? Black Christmas, the original version? - Mm-mm. - Rosemary's Baby? - Nope. - The Fly? - Mm-mm. - That, that crazy Japanese movie, Audition? No? - Mm-mm. - Really? None of these? - No. - None of these? How about The Prowler? House on Sorority Row? Slumber Party Massacre? April Fool's Day? Maniac? Deep Red? - Uh-uh. - Peeping Tom? Silent Night, Deadly Night? - No. - The Exorcist? - No. - Okay, what have you seen? - Um, oh, Monsters, Inc. It was so cute. - Oh. I feel so sorry for you. - Just eat your chicken. - I don't like chicken. - Okay. - All righty, so, oh, this one's mine, okay. This one is for James. - Thank you. - Test, okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay, okay. - All right. - So repeat. - Okay. I did, a little mess-up, but that was good, right? I, I spoke French, yeah. What , huh? So that's like, uh, that's like terrible. Yeah, yeah, we have a word like that, too, and it means-- - No-- - It means bad. No, yeah, what? I mean, I don't get it. What, did you do this whole thing just to, are you trying to-- - No-- - Are you trying to poke fun at me in front of all my friends? Is that what you're trying to do? - No - 'Cause I don't, huh? No, you're not part of this. What, no, what? Why would you, why would you say something like that to me? Why would you do this to me? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Huh? - Bryan, Bryan? - What? - It's time, huh? It's time to go. - Okay. - Yeah, yeah? - Yeah, it was real nice talking to you, Brice. - Actually, I've never been to Asia. - Oh, really? - Yeah, I don't know what I would do. I don't know too much about that side of the world. - Ah, uh, um, uh, do you know anything about Korea? - Yeah, K-pop! - Oh! ♪ I got a boy chakan ♪ - Ah, ah! - Oh, just that? Do you know anything else? - No. - Oh, okay. We will teach you. - Mm. - Okay. - More stuff. Okay, okay. - You've been to Spain a few times, right? - Mm-hmm, we go every summer there. Summer? Summer. - Summer. - Summer, summer, summer. - Okay, wow, um, well, I'm going to Spain really soon. - Really? - I got a job there. - Yay, wow! Hey, maybe you can give me your contact? - Yeah. - Maybe we can meet up for lunch there? - Yeah, that'd be-- - I know a lot of great places, trust me. - Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - And, uh, since you come to Europe, why don't you come to France? Huh, Brice? - Yes. - Yeah, we would love to show you around. - Oh my gosh, really? - Yeah, really. You know what? I always wanted to be, um, too, too gid, too gid? - Too gid? - Too gid. - Oh, uh, tour guide, tour guide! - Oh. Tour, tour guide, yeah. - Tour guide. - So, here's my phone. - Okay. - Give me your email. Okay? - Okay, okay, good. Okay. - Don't forget your name. - Okay. - Because I don't remember. - Okay, here you go. - Good! - All right, all right. Looks like the fun is almost coming to its end. It's getting late, so we'll soon be calling you all cabs. But before that, let's play one last game, okay? The final game. So let me just say thank you, all, so much for coming. I hope you all had a great time, you know, made some long-lasting friends here. Now the final game is very simple. It is hide-and-seek. Now the rules are also very simple. You all hide, and if we find you, we will kill you and eat you. Now don't worry, I'm not an evil person. I will give you 10 seconds to prepare yourselves. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. - Oh, shit! - Oh, oh! - Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. - The young one is mine. - Come on, man, that's the one I want. I touched her first. You know the rules. - I called it, and it's mine! - Fine! Fine, I'll take the other one. Come over here, you. Jimmy's gonna want this. - What are you saying? Are you praying? Do you believe in God? No one will save you. They will never find your bodies. I promise you I will kill you quick. You won't suffer. - Just speak English. I want to understand you. What the fuck did I just say? Speak English. I want to understand you. Just tell me something in English! - Please. You're handsome and nice, sir. Don't do this. - Huh. Mm. Thank you. But I like eating people. - James, let me go. - Mm, you know, your English isn't that bad. You still need a bit of practice, but don't worry. That won't matter soon. - I want to see my sister! - No, you will never see her, okay. Well, maybe in Heaven. Hey, calm down, calm down. Hey, calm down. - Hey, cutie. So listen, I liked your Christmas sweater, so I borrowed it. I'll keep it safe, don't worry. You don't mind, do you? - Why are you doing this to me? Please, just let me and my friend go. - Oh honey, your friend's probably dead already. It's been such a long time since we had a chicken party. My friends were going crazy, begging me to have another one. We were all just kind of losing it a little, slipping. Soon we'll start eating each other , hmm? Sometimes I can't remember things that I did. There are like these empty spots in my memory. I'd like to go see a psychologist, but then I'd have to kill them. No one's getting in my head, nobody. You look so pretty. I'm always so shocked at how pretty Korean girls are. - I want to live. I want to go home. - I just gave you a compliment. And you didn't say thank you. Say thank you. Say thank you. Say thank you! - Thank you. - Oh. In Korean. - Oh. Oh, bark for me. Bark for me. Bark for me or some really bad things will happen. Oh you're so cute. Oh don't cry. Don't cry, you'll make yourself all ugly. Don't you want to be pretty? How else are you gonna get a guy to like you? You like guys, right? Remember James from the party? James, tell you a secret, has a great, big cock. He does. No, really. Wait, you don't want to play with me? Okay. Guess I'll just play by myself. I'm just fucking with you. I'm a lesbian. Never had a guy inside of me. But I have had guys here before. You know, the thing about guys is, once you cut off their penises, they lose all will to live. It's true. It's crazy. You cut them off, and then you can even untie them, and they don't run away. Makes it all very boring and simple. So I have to just kill them right there and eat 'em. Ridiculous, isn't it, how it's man's world? I mean, they have this one weakness, and so quickly they can lose the will to live. Women, though, woman are different. Women'll keep fighting back, no matter what you cut off. I hope you fight back, Miel. I mean, the more you fight, the longer you live, right? And who know? You might beat me. Might. So you ready? You ready to fight me? - If, if I beat you, you will let me and my friend go? - Um, I can't promise your friend. Like I said, she might be dead already. But, uh, you'll have to do more than beat me. You'll have to kill me. It's the only way you'll get out. So are you ready to do this? Fighting! - It's okay. Just, hey, hey, just getting the scarf. It's okay. Look, just, oh God, I am so sorry. That looks like that hurts. Hey, hey, Koume, Koume, right? That's your name, Koume. Yeah, I think it was on your name tag. It fell off, somewhere, but... It's me, Bryan. Bryan, we met at the party. Okay, look, look, look. You do not have to worry about a thing, okay? I promise you. I promise, I do not eat people like my friends do. It's... No, I don't. - Can you come here? - Oh, no, no, it's, that's just Jimmy. Don't worry, that's-- - Don't be like this. - He's my best friend. I think I told you about him. Hey, Jimmy. What? Jimmy! No, no, no, no, no. Jimmy, you do not have to worry about a thing. She is not gonna take your spot. No one could ever take your spot. You're the very best friend anyone could ever ask for. You know that. Hey, I have a good idea. Why don't you meet him? Yeah, Jimmy, come over here. Come over here and say hi. Come on, don't be shy, get over here and say hello to Koume. Look, here he is. Say hi. Ah! God, I don't know what's wrong with him. He's usually not this shy, you know. I think I know what the issue is. I think he likes you a lot. Huh? Yeah. Okay, okay, you know what? I get it. I'm gonna step out of here for a little while, okay, let you two be alone, get to know each other a little bit better. But don't you worry. I'm going to be right back. I'm just gonna be getting the tub ready, okay? Hey! That's not where I left you. You know what? I think that it's time for you to learn the five rules. That way, you understand how things work around here a little bit better, yeah. Don't try to run away. That's rule number one, sweetheart. If you try to run away, I won't feed you. Rule number two, don't you ever try and hurt me. All right, if you do, I will fucking beat you again and again until you say that you are sorry! Rule number three, you do whatever it is I tell you to do, okay. It doesn't matter how fucking crazy it sounds to you. You do it, all right? So for example, let's say I told you to blow me. Well, then you blow me. It's simple. Rule number four, I always win the game, okay. If I lose, well, then you lose a body part. And rule number five, we always play naked! What, it's funny. God, fucking, Gloria! Move, move, you're going slow. Sit down, right there! - What the fuck, Gloria, hmm? What the fuck is wrong with you? I mean, do you not want to eat? Is that your thing? I mean, what did I just tell you, Koume, hmm? Do not fucking run away! I'm going to let this one slide. But if you pull this shit again, I am going to fucking kill you. Do you understand me? My hands are tied here. Now just, look, just introduce yourself to Koume, okay. You're going to be friends. Just introduce yourself. Goddammit, Gloria, do not be rude! Introduce yourself! - What, what did you just say? Gloria, what did you just say? That sounds like an insult. Did you just insult Koume? That is a bad Gloria. - Well. Koume, you can speak Spanish, huh? Wow, you know, you are very different. I like you. I really do. Excuse me. - No! No! - Should we play our first game? That's a yes. Here we go. - Oh don't worry. It'll all be over soon. But you know what? Before I eat you, I want you to see something very cool. You might like it, since you're a dancer, right? I mean, I saw you dance. You dance good. I want you to hear my favorite song. Oh, you probably never heard of it since, since you're from China. Sorry, I mean, Japan! This song is amazing. I even got a killer dance for this song. Check it out, you're gonna love it. ♪ Sing ♪ ♪ Bitch, you'll be mine ♪ Oh goddamn! That is such a good song. Let's hear it one more time, shall we? - No, all right, get down, right there. All right, so our first game is called How Long Can Koume Hold Her Breath? So let's play. - No! - All the way in, all the way in. You know, my father was a bad man. He was an evil man. I had a dog that I loved. His name was Duke. And he, one day, my dad, came home from work and picked up his revolver and shot Duke right through the stomach, no reason, and then he just bleed and suffer until he finally died. There was another day when my dad got drunk as hell and just, oh, just beat the piss out of my mom. Well, he almost killed her, you know. But he didn't. No, just like before, he just wanted to watch her die a very slow death. I wanted to save her. You know, I wanted to help her. I kept trying to go to her, but, you know, he would, every time I would go, he would kick me down. He was so much bigger than I was. - Shut the fuck up. - And I was so scared. I was so scared, because I knew that I had to be next. So I knew that I had to be ready, because I was going to be next. So one night, I, I walked into the kitchen, and I grabbed a knife. And then I walked up the stairs and went to my father's room, and there, there he is sleeping. And so I walk over to his bed, and I get on top of him. And I stab him. Then he wakes up, so I stab him again. And I stab him again. But I do not kill him. Oh no. No, no, no, no, I let him suffer like he let my mom and my dog suffer. My dad was a strong man. It took him a long time to die, but he finally did, and that's, that's when I knew that I liked watching someone die. I loved it. The life leaving their body is, oh, it's, it's fantastic. It's wonderful. So I wanted to see it again, you know. So, you know, I was young. So I called over my friend from school, and , and I killed him. But I didn't know. I didn't know, 'cause I was a kid. He didn't deserve it. But it's okay. It's okay, because you came back, didn't you, Jimmy? You came back, and you told me that everything was going to be okay. And it has been. It's been okay. Oh Jimmy. You are my very best friend, you are. I love you. I love you, I do. Koume, what are you? What are you? Who are you? Answer me. Who the fuck are you, huh? You answer me! What do you want from me? Why are you here? Huh? Oh, oh, oh no. No, no, no, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Koume. Jimmy. Uh, Jimmy, you watch her. I, I have to get Gloria. God! Fucking Gloria, man. What the fuck are you doing, hmm? Goddammit, Gloria. You, fuckin' again and again, why are you always trying to leave me? God, you don't want to be my friend anymore? You want to leave? Okay, yeah, yeah, okay, leave. Let's see you leave. How 'bout this? If you can make it to the door, then you're free! Then you're free to go! How 'bout that? You wanna leave so fuckin' bad. I got a new friend now. Yeah, you met her earlier, and she is way better than you ever have been and ever will be, you fucking bitch. You fucking little bitch! Jimmy. Jim. Where did I leave my fucking ax, goddammit? Fuck, fuck me. Dammit. Fuckin' did this, you did this! Fuckin' dammit. All right. I'm so sorry that you had to see that. Again, Jesus, it just, it's fuckin' Gloria, you know. I told her so many times, over and over again, and she just would not fucking listen. God, I just, I just feel so bad, you know. What? Well, oh, I see. I see. You think that I'm not a person who gives people chances, but I do. I fucking do! Fucking looking at me! Tell you what, tell you what, you know, tell, I'll give you a chance, all right? Now, how 'bout this? You want a chance? Stop, stop. There. You want a fuckin' chance? Then fuckin' prove it to me! Fuckin' bitch, huh? I am so goddamned heated up, right now! You fucking want to be free of me. You don't want to be my friend. Then you stand up, and you prove it to me, you little prom queen bitch. Do it! I'll let you have the first swing. Think you're so fucking good. Come on, come on, come on. Go on. Go on. - I never trusted people. Never. When I was young, I trusted someone. I thought he would never hurt me. But I was wrong. He hurt me and took me. And after that, I never trusted anyone. Never! And you just made the same mistake he did. - Yeah? And what was that? - He let his guard down. - Wow, wow! Now that is a song. Oh my God, I love it. I love it! Oh man! Woo! I'm tired now. I'm hungry too. Hold on for a bit. ♪ Dreams ♪ ♪ Can you come true ♪ ♪ And will you be strong ♪ ♪ Dreams ♪ Hah! Just kidding. I heard that teriyaki sauce tastes good on Japanese food.

Speaking of which, who all is coming tonight? - Hmm. - Oh yeah. - Uh, we got two little Japanese girls. - Oh. - Oh, that's nice. - I invited this Chinese guy. - Oh? - But I don't think he's gonna come. But I did invite this French couple. They'll be here. - Okay. - I invited a girl from Costa Rica. I think she is. Doesn't matter. - Well, Sarah and Samantha, you two are going to love me. I invited two very beautiful Korean girls. - Oh, you're the best! - I know. - Wow, Korean, I haven't had that in a while. I hope they make it. - They will. - Mm-hmm.
