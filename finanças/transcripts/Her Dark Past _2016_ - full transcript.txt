I'm sorry. I know that's not worth much and...I know that.. ...I'm the last person you want to hear from today. I can't give back what I've taken from you. The only thing I can do is try to make things right. Please...forgive me. Please...forgive me. Oh, my God! Hey. Hey.. Hey, baby. Hi. Dr. Mathur! Dr. Mathur! Hey.. Shu.. Shu.. Shut the light. Close the blinds, please. Hello, Alice...you're awake. What's going on? Who are you? You don't recognize Peter? 'Your husband.' Can you tell me your name? Your name is Alice. Alice Richardson. You survived a gunshot to the head. 'From a medical standpoint' 'you're doing remarkably well.' You're very lucky. The bullet trajectory was contained to the right frontal lobe. What does that mean? 'It means that no vital' brain tissue was damaged. As far as getting shot in the head goes.. ...this is the best case scenario. Why can't I remember anything? 'Severe head injuries can result' 'in two different kinds of amnesia.' What you have is retrograde amnesia where memories are affected prior to the injury. 'Memory loss can vary from...a couple of hours' to days and even months. It is extremely rare for anything up to a year and beyond to be lost. But in your case.. Now, what were you saying about her being lucky? - Are you okay? - No, I'm not. And neither is my wife. 'How do we fix this? How can I fix this?' - We can't. - Well, what can I do? Her memories will come back. All we can do is wait. What can I do? 'My wife doesn't remember who I am.' So how can I help her do that? How can I fix this? I need something to do. You can go outside. - Sorry. - Outside. I'm sorry. Do you know what happened to me? 'We have our theories but...no.' 'All we know is that..' '...you were found in a park' 'with a gunshot wound to the head.' I wouldn't be surprised if the police contact you once they are notified that you're awake. The police? It's still an active case. 'I've been asked not to speak with you about the details.' I don't think I'm ready to talk to the police. Don't worry, they won't push you too hard...yet. Fortunately, you've had ample time to recover from your injuries. How long have I been here? 'You were in a coma for three months.' 'You're not on the list, and-and only immediate' 'family members who are on the list--' 'I'm her second cousin.' 'Immediate family members' 'who are on the list are allowed to visit.' 'I'm sorry, it's just policy.' Fair enough. I can tell I don't want to get on your bad side. 'Peter...he was by your side every day.' 'He never gave up hope.' 'Does this mean I have to go home with him.' The question is, Alice, what do you want? I want to remember. 'Peter. Dr. Mathur is asking to see you in her office.' Great. Thank you. And she wants to go home already? Yeah. She wants her old life back. Okay. Alice is still in a fragile state. Physically, she's fine but she'll be enduring a lot of mental and emotional stress as she re-adjusts. Everything about her life is a mystery. And there's no telling what will spark her memory. My life's become a mystery too. I.. I can't understand why anyone would want to kill my wife. I don't know, Peter but it's extremely rare for memories to never return. Typically, memories return on their own when they want to. It can be a few days, it can be a few weeks. Bit by bit, they'll come back. But it's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle. It might take time for her to remember how the pieces fit together. I'm counting on you, Peter. If she has questions, answer them. But please don't push her. And don't mention her past history with depression. She's still healing. Most importantly, she needs time. Alice is going to feel like a stranger in her own home. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. Di.. Did you sleep? Not really. Do you remember anything? No. Uh, that's okay. Dr. Mathur said it should take a couple of weeks. So...what now? We try to get back to being normal. Our routine. Twice a week, your visit with the doctor. This is weird, right? No. Of course not. It's weird, yeah. Uh, well, maybe we should get to know each other. It can only help. - Okay. - What do you do? 'Uh...investment consulting.' Basically, I tell other people how to spend their money. Do you work a lot? Sometimes, uh.. I am trying to not let it consume me too much. Must pay well. We're comfortable. And me? What do I do? Yoga, Krav Maga, reading. Um, you took up playing piano not too long ago. I didn't work? No. You think working gets in the way of living. I...kind of sound like a brat. I admire it. I wonder if you, like, with the piano do you forget how to play? - I don't know. - Hmm. Well, maybe we should find out. Maybe you don't try to remember how to play, you just play. What else can I do? I think this is cause for celebration. You wanna grab some wine? I don't know. Do I like wine? Let's not spoil the surprise. I like wine. I knew that. What was I like? You were very passionate, confident, unpredictable. If you want something, you get it. Like, spontaneously getting a tattoo. You-you mean, I.. This isn't a teenage act of rebellion? No, I came home one night and there it was and I asked you what it meant and you said, "It was a crow kind of day." Wow. When I noticed it before, it felt, I don't know.. ...important, somehow. Well, maybe it will spark something. You okay? Yeah. Sorry, I don't, I don't know what happened. Dr. Mathur said not to rush it, so...you just take it easy. Why don't I cook us dinner for tonight, huh? You cook too. - Yes. - Did I cook? Unh-hnh, not if it involves major appliances. Wow! You really hit the jackpot with me. I did. I'm gonna swing by the market. Restock the fridge. Um, you'll be okay here? Yeah. I think so. Don't go in the attic. That's where we keep the bodies. That's a dangerous game you're playing. Peter, where's my family? I'm sorry, Alice, you don't, you don't have any family. It's just us. I'm it. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll, uh, I'll be right back. 'Alice.' Who are you? Is it true what the doctor said? She told me you can't remember anything. I'm sorry. What do you want? It's me, Darren. Come on, you have to remember. I don't. Alice, we were together. You were gonna leave all this behind. No. I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that. I'm married. 'You did do it.' Before you were shot, we had plans. We should have been gone already. I'm not the sort of person who would cheat on her husband. How do you know? It's not fair. What you're doing to me is not fair. I'm sorry. I know this is hard. Okay, but it's the truth. - I need you to leave. - Alice, we love each other. - Please, go. - Alice! Go! Alice? Hey.. 'Alice.. Alice.' Peter? 'Hey, you're up.' What's wrong? You okay? You have a bad dream? You remember something? No. I.. How did I get here? I came home and you were sleeping on the couch. 'You don't remember?' I wish people would stop asking me that question. Sorry. I'm sorry. I guess I just got confused. There wasn't anyone else here? At the house? Forget it. I, um.. You're right. It was probably a bad dream. I'm fine. Really. I, I think I'm just gonna head to bed and try and get a full night's sleep, if that's okay? Yeah, of course, it's fine. You don't want any dinner? No. I'm so sorry. Uh, listen, I don't want you to worry so I'm gonna sleep in one of the other rooms for as long as you need. - Thank you, Peter. - Of course. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. And, uh, Alice, I almost forgot Dr. Mathur called, and she thinks it's too soon and so do I but the police are anxious to speak to you. Tomorrow. ♪ Don't see it as love ♪ ♪ You think they want your blood that you ♪ ♪ You can let your guard.. ♪ Like playing a piano. ♪ Don't see it as love ♪ ♪ You think they want your blood ♪ ♪ They they'll take away your crown ♪ ♪ But you're wrong ♪ ♪ And you are the haunted.. ♪ The reason I asked you to come here is that um, the case is still unsolved. We know that you were shot in the head and left for dead. I wish I could help you, detective but you are aware of my condition, right? Yes, but it's been three months, and we don't have anything. No weapon, no witnesses. Every day that passes makes this case more impossible to solve. So anything you can remember will help. I'll try. Thank you. The biggest question is, is there anybody in your life that might have done this to you? Detective, I only know five people, and you're one of them. What makes you think it's somebody that I know? Most of these cases are. This is.. This is the spot actually. 'There was no sign of a struggle.' Well, I mean, it's a park. I could have been mugged, right? That's very unlikely. You had all your valuables on you. 'Also, there was no sign of an attack.' No bullet casing, gunshot residue blood spatter consistent with the trajectory. What does that mean? It means that we don't think you were shot here. Your body was dumped. So where was I shot? We don't know. It must have been close because you were still alive. 'We've been through every possible scenario.' 'especially with your husband.' 'It's been three months, and we still don't know.' 'Anything you can tell us is helpful.' I'm sorry, detective. I don't even recognize the clothes that I'm wearing. There is another possibility. It's remote but possible. Based solely on the bullet's trajectory. 'Your injury is consistent with a self-inflicted wound.' 'Alice?' Alice, are you okay? I'm sorry. I can't do this. - Alice? - I can't. Alice, look.. Alice! Is it possible for memories to get warped after what happened to me to remember things wrong? I've had patients suffer from confabulation after a serious head trauma. Uh, that's when the brain generates distorted or entirely fabricated memories. Could I have that? In those cases, the patients believed the false memories. 'They had to be told that' 'they were remembering events incorrectly.' The fact that you're conscious of this.. What makes you think the memory is wrong? Just a feeling. Maybe I just don't want it to be true. The way you described the memory.. ...like it overcame you.. 'Recalling it was involuntary?' Yeah. Just flashed in my head. That's what we call intrusive thought. They're typically unpleasant. And not unheard of after a traumatic incident. Can we make it stop? 'With enough time and therapy, we can work through it.' That door that you've just opened.. ...there's good memories there too waiting for you to find them. 'You've been given a clean slate.' 'A second chance 'to be the person that you've always wanted to be.' Okay. I hadn't thought about it like that. You can do this, Alice. Hey, you're back. How'd it go? I checked in with Dr. Mathur and then saw the detectives working on my case. Did they find any leads? I mean.. ...did they have anything helpful to say? No. Just a lot of questions. Right. Well, I'm proud of you. And, uh, I wanted to, um.. ...give these back to you. They took them off at the hospital. And I understand if you're not ready to put them on you know, it's fine. I will soon. I promise. Okay. Whenever you're ready. Hey, it's Alice. We need to talk. Can I meet you tomorrow? No. I have a place in mind. Okay if I sit? Yeah. 'Not to dump all over your meeting spot' 'but this park kind of sucks.' Yeah. It's where they found me. Who? When you were shot? Jesus, what the hell did you want to meet here for? 'I thought it might spark something.' I found something, and I don't understand it and I don't know how bad it is. What? Is there a reason you're asking me instead of your husband? I mean, what if he doesn't know? But you... we already have a secret so maybe I told you more. Did I? You weren't happy, Alice. I mean, you were comfortable and.. Sure, there were good days, but.. ...you weren't happy. At least, that's what you told me. Okay, but what about the rings? All I know is that you were married before. But you didn't like to talk about it. You never gave me a handful of engagement rings if that's what you're asking. Maybe Peter knows. No. No, I don't think so. He, uh, he has kind of a temper. You want my advice? I don't, I don't know. Wherever you found these just put them back and forget about 'em. You're good at that. Sorry, the old you would have laughed. The more I learn about the old me the more I don't like her. I think I'm gonna tell Peter. About what? About this? Maybe us. Are you insane? Maybe I am. I mean, what kind of a person am I? God. I'm asking the man I'm having an affair with for advice about my marriage. Alice, we happened for a reason. It's not because you were a bad person or you were bored or you were spiteful. Then why? All those pictures hanging on the walls they.. ...they might seem perfect to someone from the outside but you both had problems. Problems that made you miserable. You told me yourself, he never stopped working. He never made time for you. He was...controlling short-tempered, but not us. Everything that you wanted, that's what we had. We were both orphans. That we were happy finally. But you don't remember that. We were the best things that ever happened to each other. I don't believe you. Alice! You'll regret telling him. You're wrong, Darren. Peter loves me. Who is this guy? 'Why are you telling me this now?' I just, I thought you would, I thought you would know I thought you would have an explanation. I thought there would be one, I.. I don't wanna have secrets from you. Well.. That's convenient for you to not want that now. 'I mean, are you kidding me?' You've been married four times before me? I don't, I don't know. I honestly, I know as much as you do. 'You're gonna add my ring to the pile next?' Were you sticking around as long as there's money? Is that who you think I am? I don't know who you are anymore, Alice. Well, I don't feel like I would do that. Neither did I. Do you want me to leave? 'I want you to do whatever' 'it is that you do, Alice.' Whatever it is that you've done in the past. But I want you to do it now. Peter.. It's not fair for me to be mad at you. Neither one of us know why you kept this from me. I'm just.. I have trouble trusting people. My last m-marriage didn't end well. What happened? I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me. Well, I have already. I'll tell you again. My ex-wife, Julia, she died ten years ago. Oh, God! Peter, I'm sorry. I came home from work one night, and there had been an intruder. The police were already here. The body.. She was lying on the bed. She'd been stabbed several times. She was perfect. We were perfect. After she died, I, I learned some things. I think she was cheating on me. You were just trying to be honest with me. I'm sorry I lost my temper. I think I'm just...scared. I can't go through something like that again. Alice.. ...you're the only good thing that's happened to me since. I can't lose you too. I thought I might go into town today. Fresh air will do me good. Need an escort? How am I supposed to say no to you right now? Is it possible for memories to get warped after what happened to me? To remember things wrong? The brain generates distorted or entirely fabricated memories. What makes you think the memory is wrong? Maybe I just don't want it to be true. Alice.. 'Why, huh?' 'I don't believe it.' It was a lie? I love you. I don't believe you. Look at me. Look at me! Why? You ruined it! Tell me you don't love me. Answer me! Tell me you don't love me! Speak, goddamn it! Answer me! I'll kill you! Damn it! Damn it! I'm surprised to hear from you. 'I remembered something' and I need to know what it means. You sure you don't wanna run it by Peter, see what he thinks? You gonna help me or not? Okay, what is it? There was a house, I don't know where. Rundown. And there was a man there. Uh, a man that I don't recognize. And he was...yelling at me. 'Furious, punched a hole in the wall.' Shit! Are you sure it was real? I mean, it could have been a dream. Maybe. Maybe he's the one who.. 'Have you talked to the cops about this?' No, not yet. I, I don't know if it means anything. Right now, he's just a, a face without a name. Did I ever talk to you about somebody that I was afraid of? Darren? 'Yeah, you did mention someone but..' ...I don't think I should say. Darren, please. You said you were scared of Peter. 'Look, this isn't right coming from me.' 'If you wanna know more, you should talk to the cops.' So why didn't you tell me? It wasn't my place to say. Someone was trying to kill me and Peter was a suspect in another murder case. 'Ten years ago, which he was acquitted for.' He had an alibi. There was no hard evidence against him. Did you even question him? 'Of course, I questioned him.' He even took a polygraph. He passed the polygraph. We questioned a lot of people. It feels like we were just sitting on our hands waiting for you to wake up. Look, in the eyes of the law he didn't kill his wife. And we have absolutely no evidence to suggest 'he did in this case either.' That's why I didn't tell you. It's not a police matter, it's between you and him. I'm sorry, I just.. We're living under the same roof and I don't know anything about him. I understand your concern. I do. Trust me, we did our homework. Can I ask you something? Of course. When I was at the park the other day did you follow me? Yes. 'Somebody tried to kill you, and we've got nothing.' So, yes, I'm keeping tabs on you and if we're being honest I'm gonna keep doing it. The guy who killed Peter's wife, did you catch him? The guy or the girl? 'No.' Great. Where are you going, boy? What is it? What did you get, boy? Martin. 'We found a gun, and it is Peter's' - What? - 'Yeah.' - Did you run ballistics? - 'We're running it right now. 'You got the paperwork?' Yeah, I've got the matching report right here. - 'Okay.' - I'll be right there. I'm just gonna be gone a day. Quick meet and greet. I'll be back before you know it. 'Are you okay?' Of course. Is something wrong? No, I'm.. I'm just prepping myself for my first night alone. Shouldn't shake things up too much. At least, you're not gonna hear any snoring from across the hall. So what have you got planned while I'm gone? I thought I might go through some more documents see if something clicks. Okay. You know, about earlier, the rings-- No. Yo-you don't have to. We've already talked about this. I know. But I don't wanna leave and pretend like it didn't happen. We got a, a chance here at a fresh start and I wanna make sure we do things right. Me too. Okay, well, it doesn't matter what the reason was. All that matters is you're back. I'll miss you. I'll call you when I get there, okay. Be safe. Don't drive yourself crazy with the documents, okay? Don't force anything. Tell me you're done with me. Answer me! Tell me you don't love me! What did you do? - Is it a tease? - It's not a tease. It's a promise. We just have to wait for the right time. - How long will that take? - Soon. How long will that take? How long will that take? It's not gonna be easy to get her to sign. Beth is a difficult woman. Hello. 'Alice, it's Detective Martin.' Hey, detective. What's up? 'Um, where are you?' I'm, uh, running an errand. 'Are you alone?' Detective, what's happening? We found the gun. The ballistics match and 'it's registered to Peter.' Where's Alice? Is she okay? - Loud and clear. - Where is she? - You're under arrest. - What? For the attempted murder of Alice Richardson. No. No, no, no. Detective, you're making a mistake. I didn't do anything. - What? Come on. - Hands. Thank you. Detective, would-would you please just speak to my wife she'll tell you that I'm innocent. What're you doing? Detective Martin. 'Alice.' Alice! Alice! I already told you, I didn't do anything. Do you recognize this? Where did you get that? 'It was at the crime scene.' 'Where you might have left it.' 'Your finger prints are on it, the ballistics match.' 'Pulled the print off the bullet' 'that we got out of your wife's skull.' No. I mean, I.. Yes, but I haven't seen it in months. It...it got stolen. - Stolen? - Yes. - Did you report it stolen? - No. 'Why?' Because my wife had just been shot. I've been accused of killing my first wife. How's it gonna look if I report my gun stolen? How does it look now? I wanna talk to my lawyer. Alice Richardson still claims she has no memory of the night in question or any night before the incident. Which asks the question. Do police have the right man this time? 'Or is Peter Richardson' 'once again an innocent man' 'wrongfully accused?' 'In highland..' You don't need to see that. Thanks, but I've already watched a dozen variations online. How have you been holding up? Okay. I guess. Memories are coming back. Little ones, not, you know witnessing someone attempting to murder you, kind of memories. How's Peter doing? He's, um, fighting tooth and nail. He's determined, I'll give him that. It's just everything I remember about Peter is so.. ...nice. I can't believe that he would do that. What about the house I told you about? Beth Crowes place? Yeah, I had my guys sweep it. You're right, it could have been where you were shot. But we haven't found anything yet. Can you check again? Look, I know you don't wanna believe me but the evidence is there. Peter has a history. Just look for me one more time. I'll do what I can. - Do you want my advice? - Sure. If this goes to trial, stay under the radar. Just try to enjoy your life. When everything's said and done, move on. I'll try. Um, is there anything else you need? No. Thank you. Actually, my friend Darren has been helping me doing errands. Oh, that's nice. Um, does Darren have a last name? Uh, yeah, Montgomery, why? I'm just curious. Detective Martin, this is Darren. Pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you, Darren. You've known Alice a while? We met years ago, right? In Arizona? That's what you said, right? Yeah, we just, we sat at the same bar. 'Rest is history.' Wow, must be very nice to have an old friend who can fill in the blanks. Yeah, he's been great. Great, well, make sure you take care of Alice then. Please, Alice can take care of herself. I'm getting that impression. I got it. Thank you. Uh, few people took the bait on the new story. Claim they know her. Always works. So, Margery, who, uh.. Oh, she thought it was pertinent that she told me she was a hairstylist. Said she worked on Alice a few times in Arizona. 'She was named Ilene then.' Okay, thank you, Margery. And, uh, James, from New Mexico. Said she kinda looks like Jenny Shaiber a girl he sorta dated a few years back. Ca-can I see that? - Yeah. - 'Thanks.' Hey, actually, do you still have that friend at the FBI? Yeah. Can you just ask him to run this through the vis scan? The name I should be looking for? 'Darren Montgomery.' Anything he can toss. 'Alright.' I gotta go run and check on a lead. Um.. Hey, uh, before you go, front desk said there's a message for you. Said some woman's driving in, she needs to meet you. They give you a name? Yeah. Uh, Beth Crowe. Are we gonna talk about earlier? The detective, she seemed very interested in us. She's just looking out for me. Hmm. Did I tell you about Arizona? Arizona. You told her that's where we met. I tried racking my brain in for a lot but can't remember telling you that. You must have. It's odd because it's true and.. ...if I didn't tell you, then.. ...you must have remembered. Did you remember? No. I've barely remembered anything. You must have mentioned it and it just I don't know, stuck. I guess. Alright, thanks. Didn't have any luck finding anything on that photo, did you? Uh, that's what I wanna talk to you about. That was my guy on the phone. Said he ran the face and came up with nothing. He wasn't in the database at all? No, plenty of Darren Montgomery's but not one of them the one we're looking for. Luckily, he found this. What's that? 'Filed by Stacy L. Montgomery.' 'His wife?' Guess so. You didn't, by any chance run across a-a death record, did you? No, why? Because...supposedly, Darren Montgomery is dead. It's been a good week, hasn't it? 'Two of us together.' Sure. I mean, considering.. Imagine this being everyday. You, me, someplace new? We can't leave, my entire life is here. 'No, it's not, that's the thing.' Think about it, we could go to the bank tomorrow. You could ask the teller to empty your joint account and then we could just.. ...build a new life. It's Peter's money. No, it's yours. Maybe half yours but come on he did try to kill you. You don't wanna hear it, I get it. 'Just think about it.' 'You deserve it.' Why not leave all this behind? Hmm? Clean slate. - Detective Martin? - Yeah. There's someone here to see you about the Richardson case. Oh, well, I'm on my way over there right now. Can you take the name and the number? - Sure. - Right. I'm Beth Crowe. I have some information you'll wanna hear. Okay, come with me. Why not? Isn't this what you always wanted? Total freedom. I don't know, Darren, I don't know what I want. 'Well, I'm telling you that it is.' This is what we always talked about. Let's just take it and run. That's not who I am. 'Alice, I think, I might know better.' No. Maybe you know the old Alice, maybe, but you don't know me. I think you should leave. Is that really what you want? Yes. You wanna know who you are? Get outside and get in my truck. 'I'll show you exactly who you are.' 'I can't give back what I've taken from you.' 'The only thing I can do is try to make things right.' 'Please...forgive me.' Look. Look at the date. She left me that the night that she was attacked. I don't know what she was planning but she must have made somebody mad. Oh, let me guess. He's rich. Alice destroyed my life. Of course, she wasn't Alice then. She was Clair. Clair? We haven't heard that one yet. So, you know...what she does. Why don't you tell me what she did to you? My husband, Marcus, we'd been married for six years when she came into our lives. It wasn't long before I realized he was having an affair. He never was very good at lying. I followed them...one night. I thought they might go to a hotel but instead they went to this.. ...house. It was run down. I've been there. It's funny, your name is on the deed. Marcus was in real estate. 'I didn't even know we owned it.' Until after he died and they started taking everything away. Who was taking everything away? The bank. Somehow, that bitch got access to all of our accounts and she drained them and then she disappeared. Turn that light on. We were broke. We dissolved everything that we owned. So we could help pay off our debts. And Marcus.. '...he couldn't handle it.' And he killed himself. Whose house is this? It's his. You recognize him? He have a name? Marcus Crowe. Marcus Crowe. Yeah, as in, caw-caw. Sound familiar? No. Who is he? Somebody that.. ...probably regrets meeting you. What're you gonna show me? In the other room. Are you sure you don't remember who you are? One hundred percent. She took everything from me. And I just wanna make sure that she doesn't hurt anyone like that again. - Urgh! - Still got it. No, I don't think so. 'Can I ask you something?' Did you really believe that she forgot everything? It's one thing to believe something.. ...it's another to be able to prove it. Alice? Alice, it's Detective Martin. I'll take the ground floor. Sorry about the bump. Hope I didn't make you forget anything else. Why are you doing this? 'Oh, just stop it.' I'm sick of the amnesia angle. I know you've been remembering things. Remembering us. You told the detective we met in Arizona. I never would have let that slip which leads me to believe there are other things you remember that you're not telling me. No, I don't. Okay? Please. I just wanna go home. Home? Oh, no. Alice, you don't have a home. That's Peter's house. 'One last big score and you had to ruin everything.' There was Peter, Lucas in Arizona, James in New Mexico. Your name was Jenny or Ilene or Clair or Alice. Sometimes you were just a girl on the side. Sometimes you actually managed to get a ring 'that made things easier.' You got their money and we'd run. Stop it. Peter, he was all lined up, ready to go. And then you heard about Marcus blowing his brains out. 'You got that damn tattoo.' 'You got soft, you wanted to confess.' 'Said you were going to the cops.' Did you really think I was gonna just.. ...let you go? You were my favorite. You just remembered, didn't you? Well, that's one less mystery. Alice? Alice? Anything? All clear. I did just get a hit on that picture. Peter was never a real target. He was my first mark and that was long before I met you. I didn't come back to him for his money this time 'although if you manage to get it, what a cherry on top.' Then why? I knew having him in my back pocket would pay off someday. 'He might have been acquitted of his wife's murder' 'that kinda stigma, that stays around a long time.' Poor Julia.. ...she wasn't as smart as you. That was few months before Peter's wife was murdered. You killed her? You killed Peter's wife. That's what happens when you lose your nerve. No loose ends, and in this case, all I had to do was drop Peter's gun at the crime scene. They didn't even care that it just showed up after three months. Yeah. You're a monster. No, I'm just thorough. At least I didn't break their hearts before I rob them that's a monster. I need you to put out an ATB on Alice and Darren. On it. Stay here in case they come home. Okay? I'm gonna call for back up. Where you headed? The only place I can think of. 'I really am sorry.' I care for you a lot. Just tell me why. After you shot me, why didn't you just leave me here? Why go through all this? 'Oh, I tried.' The next morning I went to the bank. What a surprise to find our accounts have been frozen. That is my money! 'You sent a letter to the bank' telling them that we agreed to freeze the account until the divorce started. I mean, how are you gonna get the money, Darren? I can't unfreeze it if I'm dead. Oh, there she is. They're gonna find out about me and they're gonna trace it back to that account and you you're not gonna get any money. I'll take my chances. The odds are better than letting you live. Goodbye, Alice. Did you bug the house? You bitch. Aah! Take your last breath. 'Alice? Alice?' I listened to that bug that you had in there. You know that that confession is pretty damning for you too, right? Yeah. I'm gonna have to take you down to the station after they get a look at you. I know. Alright. Let's get you to the hospital. 'Detective?' Yeah? Don't forget your coat. Thanks. 'How are you feeling?' 'I'm fine.' How about your memory? Um, remembering, thanks. 'Little things everyday.' Listen, I.. I wanted to thank you. - 'For everything.' - Just doing my job. No. I mean, what you said about a second chance. I think...the old Alice that's what she was looking for. Well, I better get back to it. I didn't think I'd see you again. I wasn't sure I was gonna come. I'm really sorry that I hurt you. Was any of it real? Or just lies from the beginning? I don't know. At least, you know the truth about Julia now. 'Yeah.' Bye, Alice. Bye, Peter. Someone left this for you at the front desk. Oh, yeah, did they say who? No. No idea. You, uh, you still have questions about this? Urgh, I can't even tell you. Just.. Did you see that death certificate anywhere? 'No. Have you seen my tie?' You own one? Yeah, I own a tie. Judge Higer needs to see me in a suit and tie. I'm sure he won't notice you're not wearing one. You look very nice. Thank you. Detective Martin, please find enclosed the last identity to add to your collection. I won't be needing it anymore. Thank you, by the way, for the death certificate. You saved me some trouble. Finding that in your pocket was a stroke of luck. - Detective? - Yeah? Don't forget your coat. I've left a gift. It's not for you, but I do need your help delivering it. I trust by now you've met Beth Crowe. Everything we took, I know it can't replace what she lost but it's a start. We are of course, so sorry for you loss, Mrs. Montgomery. But with your documents in order and the account unfrozen you should be able to access your funds from anywhere in the world. Thank you. By the time you read this it'll be too late. I'll be long gone. Believe me when I say you won't find me. Too many people have been hurt. The least I can do is give back what Darren and I stole. Shit. As for me, I'm off to find the new me. I haven't decided on a new name yet. I won't rush into it, it has to last me a lifetime. With love.. ...Alice, Stacey, Claire, Jenny, Ilene.. ...and a couple more you haven't found yet but I'm sure you will. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
