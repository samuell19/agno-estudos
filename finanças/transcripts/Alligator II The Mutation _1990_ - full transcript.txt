Then she started dying, dead the fish swam along the lake's surface, they were ripped by water leechers, but then they also started to die. There was a big hole. It's so big! But this can not be eaten. And it happened that we had nothing, An example is Brothers O'Challo. None of this happened until that Brown did not come. Unfortunately, everything it does is based on the law. I think we had a deal, Ruben. Do you carry a radio locator with you? Yes, I'm carrying. Do you want an AM or FM wave? Decisions of internal police control are suspended by LUCO. Their decision has already been made. Hodges will be suspended, and must go to a psychiatric examination. The two are waiting to carry it out. Harmon was also suspended until the circumstances are not examined for which he did not exercise his authority. Does your mother know that are you always awake? Vinnie Brown can be extracted from murder, and do I have to carry the locator? It has to stop, Hodges. In the beginning he was released for a hard guy with dark glasses that shields. But now he started killing people. It can be him or some of his sick people, but what about it? They are as crazy as he is. It is not Brown who is killed the brothers O'Challo. It's in the lake big alligator. I did not believe in the story either in the beginning. But I'm telling you the truth. Two people were killed downtown. I'm talking to you about big fish, and you tell me about the alligator. It's beautiful, Lobo. It's wonderful. I'm talking about fish, and about it some poison goes from the bottom of the lake. Or maybe it's Brown and you attracted to your side? Super, Lobo, Absolutely great. I'm telling you the truth, Ruben. Ruben, you have to let people know They keep away from the shore of the lake.

What was it? You will not consider me a fool? - No, Henry. It was a huge crocodile, I swear by my life, he was big, big, huge... How big, Henry? He used Otis like a goblet. Otis was my friend, David. He did not deserve to end like a chopper. Otis was a good man, Are not you, Henry? And you and I know where they're going good people, right? What do you want to do? That Hodges is suspended? Come on, Clarence. A lot of that depends on this weekend. All right. What do you want from me? I need time. 24 hours? There's time till tomorrow at noon.

Listen, Clarence, maybe it's time that they begin to understand you seriously the situation we are in, a I'm moving right now in search of him. I need heavy artillery. Maybe even a burglar. You must help me to say that, or are you still not allowed? What do you need? Pu ke, several shells, par Dynamic Thin, we can also Glock 17. All right. How and where? Your car, park them on the turnstile In the center, give the keys to Elena. I need one and at least one Reliable help. Harmon. - Harmon? Wait a minute. Do not send a lawyer. I do not want beginners. We all have problems. I heard he was a professional on the way here. You should arrive here before dawn. I know he got you in trouble. But the case. You have to trust Hodges. Trust Hodges? When I see Hodges, they'll check if he deserved the reputation that followed him. Your wishes will be fulfilled It's a lot worse than what you think. Where are you going? I'm going to get drunk. Great, let's go together. Do you think I'm stupid? Suspended police officer who's kidding around with mayor's daughter? Wonderful. Now you're saying yes are you talking about? Did you think that I did not Is not everything in place? Ð—Ð½Ð°Ð¼Ð° Ñ‚Ð°? Forget it. This was just a lot of waste of time. Do you think these are you trousers tight enough? Please? Has anyone already told you that Have a very nice background? No. No? - No. Nobody would count on counting. Can I? No. - No? But the doors are open to poke. Yes? - Yes. What are the rules? - Let's say you've won a certain one number of points, but you're not reached the final point. I'm a modern girl, but I own an old self-esteem. So? What are we always waiting for? Let's go. I remember my father. He's just... simple he could not help himself. He had... Often loose days, and he kept me aside, away from you. I hated him for that. You were just a kid, how are you? Could he feel? I was not the best kid. I guess I'm for him was just one big disappointment. I apologize, but this is not about evening schedule. What are you doing in my house? You're right. Did you drink? No! Show me reflexes. Come on. Hodges, hold your hands away from me. Come on, come on, show me we ta mo e. Hodges. - Come on. What do you do? You need a cool place. How many drinks did you drink? Somewhat. Listen, this is my house, and me I'll throw you out. Yes? When does the thought start with ejection? I plan on the next move. Whether it will be the same effective as the first one? When you get to know me better you know I'm ready for much more. Listen, Rich, you're no longer suspended. What? Because of the extraordinary situation Your suspension has been canceled. We have a lot of work, and we do not have time for losing. Hodges, what's happening? We're going to catch alligators. - Now? Now! Hunt for an alligator? Yes, you think it's in the lake It's a big alligator. I do not have time to cheat. Are you with me or not? I am with you. All right, go get out, buddy ready to move within 5 minutes. I apologize for that I interrupted you. Good night, Miss Anderson. I said good night, Miss Anderson. What's up? The doctor was right, not alone does not know how much. These chemicals are related to saliva and adrenaline. This is Sheri Anderson, Mayor's daughter. She got into a car against my will. Ao. This is Officer Rich Harmon. It will help me in action. What about the adrenaline? - Do you remember the project "Future." chemicals "that dealt with experiments in connection with the acceleration of growth? Yes, but also that the prosecution was banned their further implementation. What they did was to merge the DNA structures with chemicals. They killed or enlisted hundreds of animals. In any case, further development experiment included testing the possibility of being so formed The hormone adrenaline is added to the composition. Listen, can you translate it And a stupid cop could understand? Where do factory waste go? I do not know... it must be stored in the drainage channels. Exactly. Then they are discharged from the lake to the lake. Yes. That's the one I'm talking about incredibly poisonous and strong. If the alligator did not kill that zasiceni a combination of chemicals and adrenaline, It's very hard to guess what he became now. Mutant... Maine... Creature... Then I do not have time to lose. What if I asked you to not going? All right, I'm going with you. Do not go with me! - I'm going. You're not coming with me. I'm going! Absolutely not. David, I've been questioning this one creature, you need help, I'm going. Come on, and so will somebody else to keep an eye on the boats. Exactly. Let's go guys.

I mean, we have to admit. Christine, you were right. He's like a mafia. We need help. Did you call Clarence? Yes, I called him over the radio, but he did not answer me. What about those hunters on alligators? Did they get to the channel? Yes, I think they are. DoÅ‚aw, where? At 4th Street Mapple. They have no choice. Come on, Chris. He has to figure out how to stop him. Do you have any ideas? You know how, right? I do not know if we would succeed...

You had a chance. From now on, it's my case. Wait a minute. I lost my brother and two of my best a friend I've ever had. You can not turn me off, Hodges. I have an unfinished business with this evil guy, detective. All right, Hawkins, they'll be on. And you're a regular rat, Brown. You caused this by throwing your own dirty waste into the sewage system. I saw it. Bring the judge, witness That's true. Ho e? Hodges, you have to prove it. Do not worry, proof. Clarence, did you make it? In contact with Colonel Mayhew? How I am, alas, that could he do? I sent a police helicopter to find Colonel Mayhew. What are we going to do with the park? What about him? We will evacuate it. Wait a minute. Hodges is right this time. I will immediately take steps to which We'll bring a colonel here. You will not have anything to do, Brown. I'm in charge, me too I'll take care of it. David, this is your ultimate the last warning. I do not want to get back there. I need time. His nest is endangered. They are looking for a new territory. He moves where he thinks It's safer, Hodges. Lake? Very good assumption. There are lots of places there. As I see it, we need to to stop immediately, without waiting. What do you do? Be quiet, ini I'm nervous. Oh, my God. Jackhammer appears from the Regent Park on the waves of the KD radio to remind you of a party that It will be held this weekend. If you have a house that is located near Regent Park, Vincent Brown likes to work to buy cash in cash. And now it's time for music. The hottest group in seventh place our top lists, You are serving "Idle Ridge", at waves of KD radios You can come by one of these two passes. You can come any of them. This is where we are now. What about those tunnels? And they have to lead somewhere. I hope they do not get into the lake. Yes. We have to keep the children on of all passes. My boyfriend is already stuck, we're talking The hell until we get it out again. We will not catch him at these crossings, He's far ahead of us. How do you know? Instinkt. In that case, we will Close the road to the lake. Let's go. We'll place an explosive at the entrances in the tunnels that lead from the lake. I have a box of dynamite. If it does not We managed to call the Air Force. Have you? I have exhausted all my supplies. I quit. A day and a half ago. - I could burn a cigarette. Where are they all? The city looks empty. Lie to them... Say everyone who comes here all for free. Food, drinks, fruits, everything. Tell everyone who has a house here I offer $ 5,000 more in relationship to the original offer. Say that anyone who brings a person who has the house here and who I am Sell â€‹â€‹$ 100. - All right, Chef. They think they beat me. But they did not. I do not know what you're waiting for to come to a party in Regent Park. We have the awards we need to share, We have popcorn and hot dog. The orchestra and DJ Jackhammer It'll be with you all weekend. So come on... And now we'll let you go It's a little bit of music. Mr. Brown. What are you paying for? Bring me people. I'm doing the best I can. Make more effort. My investors are here now, this weekend. Turn on the program. Tell me I'm paying money on your hands, now! Easy. I hope your idea is about with an explosive to have an effect. These dummies never they were not let down. Attach here. Push this way. Do you really know what works? How much work have we done today? The job was good when they were not these guys appeared. Get out of here, and you will in a nasty problem. I love problems. They will not love this one of me. Find me. It's better to go away I'm not back. I'm scared of fear. Ta radi? We need to talk. Alone. Hawkins! Hurry! Are you going down there? Are you doing this? This is a convincing argument. How will this explode? Depends on the thickness of his armor, we will still have a problem or a solution. Come here to the big rustic mucus we create irregular accounts. One Mississippi, two Mississippi. Three Mississippi. We have 10 missions until it arrives bus to take us out of town. Go. I'll make a bomb, David? I do not understand. The detonation needed it Throw it so high that it should fall down only next week. - He's obviously not dead, is he? Hell, when it's time it is. Hawk, come back! This guy is crazy. - What do you mean? Hell, this alligator eats everything. He's a walking bomb, David. No wonder that it did not explode, He ate a detonator. We have no choice. We have to keep him away from the lake. We'll stop him. We'll have to split. Rich, you know where the tunnel is over. I hired him there, you and Hawk Wait for me. No chances, Hodges. We'll stay together. And I also think you should stay together. Chris... All right, I made it. What is it? Sayenetin. That's very deadly, David. Occasionally, this alligator carries within himself a bomb of great devastating action. Would this be possible cause an explosion? I do not know. Maybe. I suppose. But in what way to put it in inside it? He looks like an armored truck. Aligators have a soft shell on Belly, right under the jaws. That means he has to talk to him very close. He's right, David. Shooting is just part of the problem. We have to. We will find a way. How do you think we do it? If you want to ask the "Big Dog" the alligator will voluntarily turn On the leash and let us do it we stab into the stomach, do not we? How to shoot out of this? Not so easy. You must talk very close to it toys, and in the water, and that he should be in the proper place They can sit, or they can not shoot. She is right. Good to know. Listen, Chris. Go to the lake. If Clarence cleaned up the space around the lake invite me to know. If there are still people, remove them Whatever way. Give me a cigarette. David-e. Loves Me. Hodges, now that he ate the bomb can they explode at any time? There is a possibility. All right, let's start the party. Unbelievable. See Elmire, a woman-snake. She walks, she says, and all that while the snake crawls over her stomach. See everything... I thought this is what we are doing what's best for the city. And it was. And it is. Look at what belongs to us. Thinking everything belongs to you. That thing is still there I'm feeling, I'm feeling. And you blame yourself for everything Your "Future of Chemicals." It's over. This is just the beginning. Look. Look around you as much as you are look up. Look what we built up. What I see are homes in which people live and in front of which children play. This is the beginning of the empire in which I will care. You have to be punished. Concerned for what You did Clarence. And I'll take care of it. I'm sorry, mayors. Do that. We both deserve this. Wait. What is it about? He's in the tunnel in front of us. Are you sure? Yes. This tunnel leads straight into the lake. Yes, we closed the sector C. But we need her people. Ð¡Ð»ÑƒÑ‡Ð°Ð¹. He needs to help us get rid of it These people from here. Miss Anderson, your Father is shot. What? Your father is shot. It will be mine. - Sergeant, she's with me, we're coming. What's happening? Dad! Dad... Get everyone here. For only one dollar you can attend the whole event. Where are the contracts? In the Act on the table. Everyone? Yes. Kill him. Kill! Get out of my way, shit. Right away. There are many people dead Because of you, Vinnie. You will if you do Do not get out of the way. Anyway. Put down the pie, Vinnie. Get out of here, Hodges. Drop the pie. I'm gonna kill him! It's all over, Vinnie. This is the end. It's over with dreams, Vinnie. You're done. You're done, Vinnie! Oh, hello. He did not pay me either. It's heading towards the south side of the lake. Go! Go home! Get out of here! We can not let him come back on the shore and killing somebody again. Go. We must get it before it does he gets to the middle of the lake. Get it. Do you see him? Where is he? What was it? What is it about? He knows we're here. Really? - Do not doubt at all. Help! Hurry! Hawk! Get up! Time for revenge! Stay here! Stay over the water, understand? We're not leaving without Hodges. He's downstairs! Come back! Tell them to get down! I do not see it! There he is! It's there! Let's go for him! Hold on! Hold on, Hodges! Get up! Thank you. Le. Have you succeeded? I did. Did it have an effect? I do not know. What does that mean? I managed to stab him, and yes It will have the effect, I do not know. He's a goddamn son of a bitch. You're right there. What will we do now? We'll try this one. What? Did you ever shoot from this? No. And you? Never. How hard it can be handling this? Destroy, then pull the gun. You're right. We just need to find out on which side is the target. Poor Hawk. - Yes. What do you mean, where did he go? I think he could have gone anywhere, but certainly near the lake. Did he ever go to bed? Exceptional reflection. Let's check out our litter. Let's go. Are you okay? - Watch the stairs. That's it. "Home Sweet Home". Hodges, uje li? That. If we're dead we're dead, Hodges. Do i, puppet. Do you have a dad. Doi. Only Lobo! Only Lobo! Well, Lobo... I suppose life going further, is not it? See you, Hodges. Yes, we see... partner. Just progress, you deserved it. I think I was pretty poisonous chemistry for the whole life. Let's go home to celebrate the birthday. Vincent Brown is dead! Remove the inscription below.
