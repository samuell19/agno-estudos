Then she started dying, dead the fish swam along the lake's surface, they were ripped by water leechers, but then they also started to die. There was a big hole. It's so big! But this can not be eaten. And it happened that we had nothing, An example is Brothers O'Challo. None of this happened until that Brown did not come. Unfortunately, everything it does is based on the law. I think we had a deal, Ruben. Do you carry a radio locator with you? Yes, I'm carrying. Do you want an AM or FM wave? Decisions of internal police control are suspended by LUCO. Their decision has already been made. Hodges will be suspended, and must go to a psychiatric examination. The two are waiting to carry it out. Harmon was also suspended until the circumstances are not examined for which he did not exercise his authority. Does your mother know that are you always awake? Vinnie Brown can be extracted from murder, and do I have to carry the locator? It has to stop, Hodges. In the beginning he was released for a hard guy with dark glasses that shields. But now he started killing people. It can be him or some of his sick people, but what about it? They are as crazy as he is. It is not Brown who is killed the brothers O'Challo. It's in the lake big alligator. I did not believe in the story either in the beginning. But I'm telling you the truth. Two people were killed downtown. I'm talking to you about big fish, and you tell me about the alligator. It's beautiful, Lobo. It's wonderful. I'm talking about fish, and about it some poison goes from the bottom of the lake. Or maybe it's Brown and you attracted to your side? Super, Lobo, Absolutely great. I'm telling you the truth, Ruben. Ruben, you have to let people know They keep away from the shore of the lake.

We all have problems. I heard he was a professional on the way here. You should arrive here before dawn. I know he got you in trouble. But the case. You have to trust Hodges. Trust Hodges? When I see Hodges, they'll check if he deserved the reputation that followed him. Your wishes will be fulfilled It's a lot worse than what you think. Where are you going? I'm going to get drunk. Great, let's go together. Do you think I'm stupid? Suspended police officer who's kidding around with mayor's daughter? Wonderful. Now you're saying yes are you talking about? Did you think that I did not Is not everything in place? Знама та? Forget it. This was just a lot of waste of time. Do you think these are you trousers tight enough? Please? Has anyone already told you that Have a very nice background? No. No? - No. Nobody would count on counting. Can I? No. - No? But the doors are open to poke. Yes? - Yes. What are the rules? - Let's say you've won a certain one number of points, but you're not reached the final point. I'm a modern girl, but I own an old self-esteem. So? What are we always waiting for? Let's go. I remember my father. He's just... simple he could not help himself. He had... Often loose days, and he kept me aside, away from you. I hated him for that. You were just a kid, how are you? Could he feel? I was not the best kid. I guess I'm for him was just one big disappointment. I apologize, but this is not about evening schedule. What are you doing in my house? You're right. Did you drink? No! Show me reflexes. Come on. Hodges, hold your hands away from me. Come on, come on, show me we ta mo e. Hodges. - Come on. What do you do? You need a cool place. How many drinks did you drink? Somewhat. Listen, this is my house, and me I'll throw you out. Yes? When does the thought start with ejection? I plan on the next move. Whether it will be the same effective as the first one? When you get to know me better you know I'm ready for much more. Listen, Rich, you're no longer suspended. What? Because of the extraordinary situation Your suspension has been canceled. We have a lot of work, and we do not have time for losing. Hodges, what's happening? We're going to catch alligators. - Now? Now! Hunt for an alligator? Yes, you think it's in the lake It's a big alligator. I do not have time to cheat. Are you with me or not? I am with you. All right, go get out, buddy ready to move within 5 minutes. I apologize for that I interrupted you. Good night, Miss Anderson. I said good night, Miss Anderson. What's up? The doctor was right, not alone does not know how much. These chemicals are related to saliva and adrenaline. This is Sheri Anderson, Mayor's daughter. She got into a car against my will. Ao. This is Officer Rich Harmon. It will help me in action. What about the adrenaline? - Do you remember the project "Future." chemicals "that dealt with experiments in connection with the acceleration of growth? Yes, but also that the prosecution was banned their further implementation. What they did was to merge the DNA structures with chemicals. They killed or enlisted hundreds of animals. In any case, further development experiment included testing the possibility of being so formed The hormone adrenaline is added to the composition. Listen, can you translate it And a stupid cop could understand? Where do factory waste go? I do not know... it must be stored in the drainage channels. Exactly. Then they are discharged from the lake to the lake. Yes. That's the one I'm talking about incredibly poisonous and strong. If the alligator did not kill that zasiceni a combination of chemicals and adrenaline, It's very hard to guess what he became now. Mutant... Maine... Creature... Then I do not have time to lose. What if I asked you to not going? All right, I'm going with you. Do not go with me! - I'm going. You're not coming with me. I'm going! Absolutely not. David, I've been questioning this one creature, you need help, I'm going. Come on, and so will somebody else to keep an eye on the boats. Exactly. Let's go guys.

He moves where he thinks It's safer, Hodges. Lake? Very good assumption. There are lots of places there. As I see it, we need to to stop immediately, without waiting. What do you do?

My boyfriend is already stuck, we're talking The hell until we get it out again. We will not catch him at these crossings, He's far ahead of us. How do you know? Instinkt. In that case, we will Close the road to the lake. Let's go. We'll place an explosive at the entrances in the tunnels that lead from the lake. I have a box of dynamite. If it does not We managed to call the Air Force. Have you? I have exhausted all my supplies. I quit. A day and a half ago. - I could burn a cigarette. Where are they all? The city looks empty. Lie to them... Say everyone who comes here all for free. Food, drinks, fruits, everything. Tell everyone who has a house here I offer $ 5,000 more in relationship to the original offer. Say that anyone who brings a person who has the house here and who I am Sell ​​$ 100. - All right, Chef. They think they beat me. But they did not.

I hope your idea is about with an explosive to have an effect. These dummies never they were not let down. Attach here. Push this way. Do you really know what works? How much work have we done today? The job was good when they were not these guys appeared. Get out of here, and you will in a nasty problem. I love problems. They will not love this one of me. Find me. It's better to go away I'm not back. I'm scared of fear. Ta radi? We need to talk. Alone. Hawkins! Hurry! Are you going down there? Are you doing this? This is a convincing argument. How will this explode? Depends on the thickness of his armor, we will still have a problem or a solution. Come here to the big rustic mucus we create irregular accounts. One Mississippi, two Mississippi. Three Mississippi. We have 10 missions until it arrives bus to take us out of town. Go. I'll make a bomb, David? I do not understand. The detonation needed it Throw it so high that it should fall down only next week. - He's obviously not dead, is he? Hell, when it's time it is. Hawk, come back! This guy is crazy. - What do you mean? Hell, this alligator eats everything. He's a walking bomb, David. No wonder that it did not explode, He ate a detonator. We have no choice. We have to keep him away from the lake. We'll stop him. We'll have to split. Rich, you know where the tunnel is over. I hired him there, you and Hawk Wait for me. No chances, Hodges. We'll stay together. And I also think you should stay together. Chris... All right, I made it. What is it? Sayenetin. That's very deadly, David. Occasionally, this alligator carries within himself a bomb of great devastating action. Would this be possible cause an explosion? I do not know. Maybe. I suppose. But in what way to put it in inside it? He looks like an armored truck. Aligators have a soft shell on Belly, right under the jaws. That means he has to talk to him very close. He's right, David. Shooting is just part of the problem. We have to. We will find a way. How do you think we do it? If you want to ask the "Big Dog" the alligator will voluntarily turn On the leash and let us do it we stab into the stomach, do not we? How to shoot out of this? Not so easy. You must talk very close to it toys, and in the water, and that he should be in the proper place They can sit, or they can not shoot. She is right. Good to know. Listen, Chris. Go to the lake. If Clarence cleaned up the space around the lake invite me to know. If there are still people, remove them Whatever way. Give me a cigarette. David-e. Loves Me. Hodges, now that he ate the bomb can they explode at any time? There is a possibility. All right, let's start the party. Unbelievable. See Elmire, a woman-snake. She walks, she says, and all that while the snake crawls over her stomach. See everything... I thought this is what we are doing what's best for the city. And it was. And it is. Look at what belongs to us. Thinking everything belongs to you. That thing is still there I'm feeling, I'm feeling. And you blame yourself for everything Your "Future of Chemicals." It's over. This is just the beginning. Look. Look around you as much as you are look up. Look what we built up. What I see are homes in which people live and in front of which children play. This is the beginning of the empire in which I will care. You have to be punished. Concerned for what You did Clarence. And I'll take care of it. I'm sorry, mayors. Do that. We both deserve this. Wait. What is it about? He's in the tunnel in front of us. Are you sure? Yes. This tunnel leads straight into the lake. Yes, we closed the sector C. But we need her people. Случай.

I managed to stab him, and yes It will have the effect, I do not know. He's a goddamn son of a bitch. You're right there. What will we do now? We'll try this one. What? Did you ever shoot from this? No. And you? Never. How hard it can be handling this? Destroy, then pull the gun. You're right. We just need to find out on which side is the target. Poor Hawk. - Yes. What do you mean, where did he go? I think he could have gone anywhere, but certainly near the lake. Did he ever go to bed? Exceptional reflection. Let's check out our litter. Let's go. Are you okay? - Watch the stairs. That's it. "Home Sweet Home". Hodges, uje li? That. If we're dead we're dead, Hodges. Do i, puppet. Do you have a dad. Doi. Only Lobo! Only Lobo! Well, Lobo...
