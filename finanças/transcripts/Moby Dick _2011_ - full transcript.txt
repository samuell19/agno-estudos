The number who knew of his existence and had knowingly given battle to him was small indeed. - Herman Melville's Entrance to Dream Park MOBY DICK North Korea has agreed to allow an IAEA inspection on all seven of its declared nuclear facilities. Wake up. Hey, eat your lunch. Your lunch! Thanks. What's up with them? What happened to that report you promised? 'Redevelopment saves us! ' Shut up and eat. We have to start a war with them. And plow up Pyeongyang to build new buildings. A nuclear bomb? We can make that. Ignorance is your biggest charm, you know. You can't make it without reprocessing facilities. The smokestacks, you pathetic idiot. Then make that first. Don't call me an idiot! The inspection would be successfully carried out. Hey, this soup is really delicious. BREAKING NEWS: EXPLOSION AT THE BALAM BRIDGE They hope it would deter Pyeongyang to? Give me some money for the cab. And now you're rubbing me? I think I have a scoop. Is there a new city about to redevelop? That's what you say to get some money from me. You twit. Tell me. See you tomorrow. What the? A small fry ran away with some internal data. Where would he go? A news company at best. Who is it? This morning, there was a mysterious explosion in the Balam Bridge on the outskirts of Seoul. The police and troops set up an investigation headquarters. This is crazy! I'm on the site. What's the problem if there is a survivor? It'll be closed any minute. Just work with the media. We got the suspect, so why not announce it? Being the Attorney General is not so easy. You do what you're told to. Wait. We can't say anything about the case yet. We're investigating so come later, people. Hey! Are you the head of the team? Who the? Two dead and one injured. In a vegetative state, dammit! The arms and legs were all... - Identity? - No known. - The motive? - Dunno. The government says it's a spy from the North. You shouldn't write that. Okay! A car bomb. A spy from the North. Don't write it! Alright. Here. Hey, it'd be nicer if you'd put it in an envelope. How long can you hold it? Until the night at most. Until then, nobody knows it but me. Alright. Don't tell anyone. I know! Thanks. Hello. Here. YOON Hyeok? Damn, it's been so long! How have you been? What? You're in the army? Becoming a real man. So what is it that you want to tell me? Come on. Hey, coffee for me. Just a moment. Yeah, a North Korean spy. Write it under that subject. Tell boss I'll dig into the Balam case. Thanks. The guy who sat here, do you know where he is? He left. What the? You look happy, you got a 'dokudie'? Hey, that's Japanese. 'Scoop' is the word. Hey! Hello. You two don't know each other? He's a newcomer, SON Jin-gi. - LEE Bang-u, right? - That's right. I'm SON Jin-gi. Nice to meet you. Glad to meet you. Remember that election fraud? He got the 'scoop prize' for it and got scouted by our boss. Oh, impressive. Thank you. Scout? It's not a baseball. Hyo-guan! Enjoying the chores? Hey, these are the only copy. Rule number one. Make copies of all documents. You have a long way to go, Gal. You told boss, right? Hey, boss! Sorry. I guess you heard from Hyo-guan. A scoop in a long time. It's the Balam explosion. Cut the crap. Already got the report hours ago. Two dead, one injured. It's early to suspect a North Korean spy. Bullshit. SON Jin-gi? Focus on your case. When will I get the list of female speculators? Detective MA, you fucking bastard. God, what's with the rain? Bang-u. For the mother of god! What the? You crazy little shit! Sorry for what... Shut up. I'm freaking tired. Go away? I deserted. You are hopeless. Hey, deserter. You're the man. I want to desert from the company. You'll go back tomorrow. You hear me? Yes. Here's to you! How did you get the scar on your thigh? Huh, my thigh? The scar? It's a great story. Where is it? I was a star. Look at this. A citation. An exclusive scar. You know the JEONG corruption scandal? There were 20 apple boxes. So it was 4 billion, right? What the? You came to kill me. What? I don't know who the hell that is. You said you'll come alone. My leg! Holy shit! I'm so sorry. I'm fine. Don't come closer. I'll forgive you if you answer my question. Is JEONG behind it? I'll tell you everything. PARK! Stop the rotary press! PARK, you hear me? Stop the rotary press! Oh, god. What's all this? The Balam explosion. Is it a symbolic action? No civilian dead and there's no announcement. The patient's not identified and doctors say nothing. Just a second. JEONG Seok-young. KIM Sang-sik. PARK Jeong-gil. How's the patient? Still in a coma. The initial target of explosion is turned out to be the Dream Park. - Hello, detective. - Hey, what's up? You get reports on deserters? Sure. Is YOON Hyeok on the list? - YOON Hyeok? - Yes. YOON Hyeok? - See his name? - He's not on the list. - He's not? - No. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. Hey, are you on something finally? What's all this? Where are you going? The NISI to find out about the bomb. Oh, hey. You majored in engineering. Yeah, why? Are you good with these? It's locked, can't decode. I'm off to NISI. No, sit down. - Bang-u, line no.3! - Give it a try. Hey! Engineering majors should unlock a disk. It takes ages. Do it for me. Thanks. Line no. 3? Hello? Hey, where are you going? Thanks for the money. Hey! It's LEE Bang-u. It's me. Who, Hyeok? Where are you? You got the bag? Yeah, where are you? Dongseong Cinema. What? Follow me. I'll play with you. Think again, ma'am. Not an easy game. You could lose big. - MAENG. - What's up? - Info on the new town. - Alright. If you keep playing poker, I'll tell your wife about it. Bye. Don't tell her. You're not on the list. Who are you? Where did that bag come from? - The Army Security Command. - What? You are in the ASC? You're fucked, man. Take the bag tomorrow and you're going back. They're gonna kill me. Nonsense! They are not gonna kill you. You know the Balam incident. Yeah. What if it's fabricated? You even know what it means? Are you sure about that? I'm not sure yet. Ok, so the disks have the info on Balam. Yes. You stay here for a while. If he gets in trouble, no info on new town. Got it? Yeah. If there's any problem, page this number. 2848 meaning 'You're fucked'. Alright, '2848'. He got straight flush, ma'am. - He's lying. - I'll stop here. - It's LEE Bang-u. - It's me. Who, Hyeok? Where are you? - You got the bag? - Yeah, where are you? - Dongseong Cinema. - What? So this informant of yours, can we trust him? He's my hometown friend. Don't worry about him. - Can I come in? - Yes, you got something? I have to investigate further. But the bridge was restricted. If Dream Park was the target, why use... What's this? So I'll make up a team on the Balam case. Make what? I'm telling you. This is a page-one scoop. Then work with SON, here. He's already on the case. Good to work with you. - Here. - Thanks. I can't believe it. You have to agree on something. What is it? - Firstly! - Yes. My name comes before yours on the report. No problem. It's ok having your name only. Secondly? Yeah, secondly? - You good with computer? - No. I knew it. Is it required? She's hot! Hello, sir. - Do we have a room? - Sure. A room? Lucky bastard! Here, multi-outlet strip. Happy to work with you. You said that before. Take a look at this. These are interesting. This man went missing and found dead in the sea. He went missing in Germany, allegedly killed by the KGB. Cut the crap. May I pass through? Oh, I'm sorry. My god. THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT Hey, we're supposed to have fun! You came to the wrong room. What're you looking at? I'm sorry. This is no place to work with those drunk twits. The head editor of politics helped us borrow this room. Computer is ready. Alright. Good. Try every 4 digits. That's only about 10,000. What about the alphabets? That's over 1,600,000. Just try it. We could get the password. Maybe, after a year? What other choice have we got? What's in here, anyway? Info on the Balam incident! Maybe on other incidents too if we're lucky. How about we focus on our case, Mr. KGB. Please don't say that. Go ahead. Start with 0001. Dongseong Cinema PR office. Hello? Who is it? - You liked it? - Yes, so delicious. Let's go. He had lunch and is headed to a bookstore. It's freezing to death. Let's go. Oh, my god. My apples! - Please! Let's go. - But I just bought them. Why did you put it there? - I had to open the door. - Give me a break. Let's go. What did you do in the ASC? I typed the documents. Not an easy job. Did you make those documents? No, I didn't So you don't know the password. I guess you've done some observation and phone-tapping. Yes, for an inspection. You mean civilian inspection? Some of the targets are dead, now. For what reason did you select the targets? There's no specific rule. There're so many targets. How did you collect all those detailed information? No specific method. We just do everything we can. Hey, we're supposed to have fun! You came to the wrong room. What're you looking at? I'm sorry. They are here. The targets never know someone is following them. - The reporters are all there? - Yes, sir. Wait until the backup comes. Yes, sir. We should wait for the backup. You said the Balam bombing was fabricated. I saw the names of suspects on documents a month ago. But we don't even know who the suspects are. I mean I can guess under the circumstances. Have a drink. - Here. - Thanks. You're not playing tricks on me, are you? I'll bring the money. Don't go anywhere. Don't start without me. I'll make it quick. Are you familiar with these names? JEONG Seok-young, KIM Sang-sik, PARK Jeong -gil. Never heard of them. What the? Who the hell are they? Then who's the suspect you saw on the document? I can't remember. It's been a long time. Are you playing a joke on me? You said it was only a month ago! It doesn't make sense. You aren't a deserter, are you? Don't even think about lying to me. What was the number? 1818? He wrote it down on? 2848! What the? 2848? We're fucked! What is this? Hyeok, come here. - Come here, you bastard! - Run! Stop! Go up, hurry! Upstairs! Get in! - What are we gonna do? - I don't know! - Do something! - Who are those people? Block the window. - Go! - What? You have to protect your informant, go! Meet me at the bar. Go, hurry! Oh, my god. No, you're gonna fall! - Hyeok! - No! What am I gonna do? You can open it? Nice to meet you, guys. I'm a reporter SON Jin-gi. Hey, calm down. Who are you? - Shut up. - Calm down. Ok, I'll shut up. I got it. We were just scared. Shut up. Don't move. Ok, I got it. I just want to know Who you are. I'm SON Jin-gi. Are you a gang? I'm a reporter! MAENG, stop the car. Get off, man! Son of a... You can threaten us but we won't stop. There's a tunnel. Get closer to the fence. You shouldn't interfere with us. What should we do? Release the small fry. I would rather not. Closer to the fence! Seoul 2, GA 4237. Sit down. Hey. Why do you keep lying to me? You believed me because I said I was from the ASC. So you told that barefaced lie? Ok, then. Where did the documents come from? That lighter I gave to you. Those men, the disks all came from the same place. Where is it? I don't know for now. It's been a game room, a bookstore, and a restaurant. Are you kidding me? Is this funny to you? Do you think all reporters are fool? I honestly don't know! Yes, I did lie to you but this time, I'm honest. If you don't trust me I have no one to turn to. Who's PARK Jeong-gil? Tell me! He's on the document you had in your pocket. ? Tell me who he is! ? Why not say anything? You're one of them, aren't you? Alright. Now, I don't trust you. What's all this? SON, what happened? Where's all the documents? What's up with your face? Say something! LEE! What the hell happened? This is a bug. They tapped us. Shit. Let's just end it here. We don't have the documents. You do as you like. We will carry on. What are you saying? Rule number one. 'Always make a copy' I already made a copy. Hey, you got me. This is the plate number. Are you in or out? What? Not identified? Gosh, who the hell are these guys? Alright, call me when the suspect wakes up. Money? What money? Give back my 100,000 won! Saejin Gas Station! Give me a light. I don't smoke. Sorry. Are you always so polite? Not helpful when digging a scoop. Being polite has nothing to do with getting a scoop. An informant is my secret. You have one? Of course. Impressive! I only know his number, never met before. Then what does he say about the Balam case? He told me names. What names? I've said it before. JEONG Seok-young. KIM Sang-sik, and PARK Jeong-gil. PARK Jeong-gil. What's this? It's an inspection report. It's not a government document. 'On the government blacklist' Why? They don't write 'government' on a government paper. So? I heard there's a power behind the government. Cut the crap. Please, give me a break! SEO Eun-sook, fiance. Here, have a drink. I'm a friend of Jeong-gil and he is a detective. I heard PARK went missing for some time now. We've been investigating similar cases. PARK recently met someone. Do you know him? YOON Hyeok. Where did you get this? I have an informant, too. Let's exchange our information. One call costs 10,000. 10,000 for a call? Then it'd be so easy to get a scoop. Why did you come to Seoul? My kid is sick. They have good doctors in Seoul. Wanna see her picture? My daughter, Hee-min. She's really pretty, not like you. She looks healthy. It's cancer, children tumor. Is that true? I'm sorry to hear that. She just has to deal with it. SON! Let's be a buddy. Huh? I mean we're the same age. You look much older but... Oh my, these Seoulites are so fast in everything. I like that. I like you, man. They're here. Let's change the lane. Be careful. Don't worry. Don't forget the signal. You're really good at this. It's nothing. So you do this often in Seoul? It's the first time. Lane change. You saw the headlines? Really effective. 'The Balam bomb terror.' Very good. What's the point of the explosion, anyway? Making the right mood. We have a big one coming. We need a small one before striking the big one. One strike is not enough these days. The Attorney General should do well. I heard he's a bit slow. This government officials are not so charming. We have to rearrange the member of National Assembly. Let's support the opposition party in the next election. - I agree. - You're right. Have you read the document? We have no objection as always. Let's see what master says. I guess we could make it public, right? Who would care? The country would be in chaos. We should announce it. The public need a shocking incident. Have a drink. Mr. JANG. Are the reporters from my daily? Mr, KIM... See you later. Stay here. A bookstore, a game room. And now it's a bar? What do you mean? Hyeok told me. So that's where the reports came from. Could be. Let's wait and see. It's a busy street. Hey, what are you doing in the middle of the night? Sit down! I'm really glad you came. The best photographer in our daily. And this is SON. Happy to work with you. Work with me? You have to sneak in. You want a candid shot? Follow me. Let's go. It's that bar, 'Moby Dick'. Shooting criminals is not my thing. I'm not going in. This is a page-one scoop, right? Right. We want to go but they know our face. I don't wanna go alone. They have a unique dung smell. It's fetid and little bit sour. Sea otters know right away when human gets closer. I gotta go to the toilet. Yeah, go. My story will help you do number two. I hate waiting. Let me ask you something. You said about the secret power. Why does it exist? Because there are people who want to rule the world forever. - Forever? - Yes. I said always close the door. What's wrong with her? Are you sure? Yeah, those machines are in there for a reason. Would it be difficult for LIM to sneak in and take a picture? Hey, how about we use this? You saying we record what they say? No wonder you were scouted. We'll do the same they did to us. - Great, here. - Yeah. Take it. God. Didn't you hear me? Lots of junkies here. Yeah, I get a story and you get a promotion. 2a. M? Alright. See you later, bye. Yes, sir. I got it. Hey, the boxes are here. Can we have more beer? Oh, I have one... - He's here. - Who? The one who just got off. LIM! Frequent lecturing on current social issues. Read slowly, you twit. He gave lectures in churches to the poor and blind. Excuse me. The reporter from the bar! You know me, right? Let me go! What the fuck! Let me go! Where's the toilet? Just stay where you are. Help me, please! Get up! Don't move! - Are you ok? - Hurry, it's down there. Go down the hall! Freeze! What is it? Wait a minute! - You are suspended. - Why? I let you make a team, gave you a room and you harass innocent people? - You're off the case. - I'm sorry. You shouldn't be. They nearly killed him! - You have evidence? - Yes, we saw them. The machines in there are only used in labs. The suspect woke up. And You, SEONG. There was no room that you saw. Go. You were drunk. - SON, Where are you going! - It was part of investigation. You need a search warrant and... Be quiet! Calm down. Come later. We're not open yet. You come once every 4 years. Are you the World Cup? What's this? You paying me back now? I should've paid back earlier. I'm sorry. Gotta go. Hey. Have lunch here. How many cups of soup did you eat? No more soup for you. Time to go, kids. Such a nuisance. Eating so much soup for free. What happened to your eye? None of your business. I know you didn't come just to give me the money. Yeah, that's right. Can I crush in your place for a few days? Cause you cleared your debt? I have no friend to ask but you. A friend? I'm not your friend. Stop! We lost him. Myeong-seon's injured. Fucking bastard. I called as soon as he got here. Give me some soup. My hand! - Detective KIM? - Yes? What's this? A bribe. You're right. This is wrong. Go in. He just woke up. - Thank you. - Go upstairs. Hello. I'm a reporter SON Jin-gi from Myoung-in Daily. Detective! The patient died! Are you interrogating them? Boss ordered me to release them. What? So you released them? - What can I do? - My god! - Hello? - Bang-u - The suspect is dead. - What? I saw the killer. I'm going to the police. Who's behind all this? Why are they killing people? There's a conspiracy. I can feel it. What the hell! You shouldn't bump car having a fender bender. You suddenly stopped the car. I didn't have time to slow down. Hey, you didn't even try to slow down! Why would I do such a thing? Alright. Wait here. Huh? No driver. This is my number. I'll call the insurance so call me later. Would you pull out, please? I have to go somewhere. Are reporters rude like you? Excuse me? How would I know if you're just trying to run away? Hey! My god! Who the hell is it? Hello, Hello? You must be Hee-min. I'm your dad's friend. Glad to meet you. I'm more than glad to meet you. You father went to Heaven, a much better place. He's dead. I saw him in the hospital. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Jin-gi. Suicide? A patient who just woke up wouldn't commit a suicide. We figure it as a murder case... Mr. LEE Just read this. Don't take questions. But people wouldn't believe it. His suicide note. I'm the Attorney General LEE Jae-poong. The police found out that the Balam bombing was done by North Korean terrorists. JEONG Seok-young, KIM Sang-sik had died. The leader PARK Jeong-gil left a suicide note and killed himself. Therefore, we couldn't find out... We got PARK Jeong-gil. I'm not saying I want a raise in salary. When they caught a mouse, I sat there and... You stink, man. Change your coat, dickhead. - What do you do with your wages? - I invest in funds. I send money to my parents. Go home. It was a car accident. There's nothing you can do. Yes, it was just an accident. So you go home and rest. Following around is not my job. - LEE Bang-u! - Just leave me alone! I really don't want to think you're also one of them. - Not once. - You mean never? I just did what I was told... It's in the box. Let's look for it. It's dawn already. Hurry up. Let's start. - Are you ready? - Yes, start with HWANG. Let's start. - Are you ready? - Yes. Let's start. Are you ready? - Hello? - Hyo-guan, Get here right now. - You should get some rest. - Just get here, right now! Hello? Hyo-guan? If it's not an emergency... Here we go again. Hyo-guan, don't hang up. Listen to me, you bastards! I don't know what you want but... you think you can rule the world? I'll find out the truth and reveal it to the world! You messed with the wrong guy. You hear me? Let's start. Tap ta-da dap. Are you ready? Listen again. - It's dawn already. - Hurry up. Let's start. Tap ta-da dap. - Are you ready? - Yes. Same letters in the middle. That's right! Can you do this? There are 36 numbers and alphabets. If you multiply it by 3... About 40,000. I can do it. F, I, I, one to nine. Then G... - No? - No. - Now try GFF1. - Thanks. GJJ... Hyeok, you haven't had your lunch, right? No, I was about to go out. Let's have lunch together. I packed yours. Happy birthday. Why didn't you say anything? Thank you. I wouldn't call this a present but... I want to hire you as a full-timer. Pardon me? You'd prefer a bigger store. No, I'm not. I like you, Hyeok. No match, next one. Next one, please. Bang-u! What's the matter? Found it. You unlocked it? JEONG SEOK-YOUNG KIM SANG-SIK PARK JEONG-GIL PARK Jeong-gil? Put them on. The interrogation is over. Be good, guys. Go! No! What's the matter? What's wrong? Get off! Get off, now! No! Dream Park wasn't the target. Then what's the purpose? What's this? This guy was found dead 3 years ago. - This guy... - Give me a break. Where's SON's notes? DIRECTOR What if the director comes? He never comes to work in the morning. The most interesting thing about the Balam case was the quick reaction of the police and the government. This relates to what I've been investigating for a long time. The secret power behind the government. I do not know the identity and purpose of the group but whenever the government faced a politically sensitive issue, the public witnessed incidents that may affect the decision. I hope the Balam incident uncover the veil of the secret power. One call costs 10,000 won. Excuse me, can I make a quick call on your phone? 4590812. Hello? I'm LEE Bang-u from Myeong-in Daily. Please don't hang up. I have an idea. If what I've said is true, you don't do anything. If I'm wrong, you hang up. Is there a secret power behind the government? Did they bomb the Balam Bridge? Did they kill SON Jin-gi? What's the next plan? What's the purpose? What the hell do they want? Why are they killing people? Listen, you bastards! You think you can stop me by threatening? Kill me just like you killed Jin-gi. There're millions of reporters out there! Kill me! If I die, the world will... Mr. LEE, you know the water vapor, right? Water vapors make clouds and it makes the rain and snow. What you know is only the rain and the snow. The important thing is the water vapor. You think you can show the water vapor to the world? That freak! Help me! What do we do? He'll go to YOON Hyeok. He doesn't seem to know where YOON Hyeok is. What happened to your face? It hurts. Here, this is the document on the Balam case. This is the police report. 1047, 1047. Same number. The plate number of the car with the bomb. I found another paper with the similar numbers. But it has nothing on it. 803. This is not a plate number. 11002011. Nov. 20th 11 o'clock. 1047 is the plate number. Then this is 08202911. Nov. 29th 08:20 Fuck. It's tomorrow. Million people will die when a nuclear bomb explodes, right? Yes, that's right. The North is making a nuclear. You think nuclear is a military weapon? Nuclear is economy. The winner takes it all. It'd be better if I make it before them. I want to ask one thing. Why do you have to kill people? Isn't that a terror? You said killing one is a murder but killing hundred is politics. Yes, if you kill hundred to save million, that's an art. Will this bring me a nuclear? Ok, be an artist. I heard you lost all your disks. What's this? How did you know we lost the disks? The board meeting. Why? I've never said it to anyone. One of the board members is one of them. Ok, you could be right about that. But that doesn't mean I have to believe your story. The bombing was a prelude and real terror happens tomorrow? I know it's a bit hard to believe. Don't run away with the idea and just write the facts. You're a journalist. Focus on the inspection reports. PARK Jeong-gil was there. How did they make a suspect even before the crime happened? Find out that. It might have the suspects of that terror tomorrow. The inspection report. PARK Jeong-gil was on that report. So the next suspect is on it, too. Let's check their schedule tomorrow. Hello, is JOO Kyeong-seong there? I wonder if he can come to the town meeting tomorrow. KIM Dong-young? This is the National Intelligence Service. Don't play a joke! Did he just hang up? Hello, PARK In-jae? This is alumni association. We elect a manager for meeting. Are you free tomorrow? What are you up to tomorrow? Jeju Island? Hello, is HAN Min-ho there? Can you come to the town meeting tomorrow? Business trip. Went abroad? In the hospital? Passed away? I'm sorry. I'M HEARING-IMPAIRED. PLEASE CALL LEE BANG-U, 2634597. Is it Myeongin? I'd like to speak to LEE Bang-u. He's not here. Please leave him a message. Master approved. Continue the process. THE 5th FEATURE DONGSEOUNG CINEMA It's from work. What is it? A woman called? The 5th feature? What are you talking about? I'm busy. Gotta go. The 5th feature? The 5th feature. Six o'clock? Here! Fire! Fire! Go to the front! Out there! Hey, Hyeok! Hyeok! There's a fire in Dongseong Cinema, hurry! Dongseong Cinema. Who are you? He's not a spy. PARK Jeong-gil's not a spy. I killed him. I'm so sorry. What are you talking about? What do you mean? He wanted to give this to you. Hyeok! SEO Eun-sook... Let's go. We found LEE Bang-u! Let me go! See the cameras? You bastards will be on page one. Hyeok! Here, get in! Let me go! Pull out. See the cameras? Let's go. Hey, stop! Let's go! I have to hide for the rest of my life, right? Getting caught, I'll be killed like PARK Jeong-gil. No, you should not hide. You have to confess to people what you have done. Then people would forgive and help you. Thank you. I wouldn't be here if it wasrt you. Shut up. Like you, I'll fight to the end. How have you been? - What happened to your face? - This is what I do. I told you. He's your kind. A jackass? Nice to meet you. - Do you go to church? - No, I don't. The priest was once my informant. I think he will do well. He needs courage. 08202911803. God, what does it mean? Some of those people were going to Jeju Island. Yeah, I noticed. Interesting, it's not even the high season yet. I went there this summer. It was chaos. I got stuck in the airport because of the hurricane. Boss nagged me for not coming back. But the flight won't... What the heck? The flight number! Flight number is 803 and departure time is 8:20. Let's inform the police. What are you doing? It's no use. You know there's nothing they can do. Then what? Just sit here? Hundreds of people will die. Don't you know? We are journalists. I can't believe there's nothing we can do. No, there's one thing we can do. BY THE LATE SON JIN-GI & LEE BANG- U I didn't put your name. You two did all the work. I'm cool with it. That's not what I mean. You shouldn't get fired. Oh, and there's rule number two. Have a great partner like you. Good job. There's no forecast in a newspaper other than the weather. Put a false report for a terror that's not even certain? Then the truth never unveils. Saving people is more important. Now, the false report is the truth. No, I can't approve a false report. I didn't come here for your approval. I wanted to show you a real scoop. A scoop for who? A reporter only observes. He doesn't solve the case. When personal opinion comes first, you're not a reporter anymore. Save the life of an ordinary man, rather than end the life of ten liars. Boss told me when I was a cub reporter. Honestly, I don't know who's behind the terror. But I really want to save that ordinary man. PARK! Stop the rotary press! FLIGHT NO. 803 HEADING TO JEJU ON 08:20 IS TO EXPLODE Who approved this report! Are you out of your mind? Get out! I don't want to see you! You're such a pain. Hopeless woman! It's not true. I'm really sorry. LETTER OF RESIGNATION We don't know anything about it. The Truth about the Balam Explosion My name is YOON Hyeok. As I said, the article is not true. The engineers are checking the plane. So please wait for just a few minute. I worked at PARK's store for 3 months. And watched his every action. He had a fiance he really loved. He was an ordinary man just like you. All this area is now a special region. There are innocent victims who lost their lives... Huh, that guy... I beg for their forgiveness. I know that guy. Never thought he'd be on TV. Excuse me, sir. Am I the only passenger? Yes, sir. Others cancelled because of the false report. Oh, really? It's good they believed it. Sorry? Nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed in Jeju Airport. Please remain seated until we park at the gate. The weather is cloudy with a little chance of rain. The temperature is 11 degree cel and the humidity is 70%. Thank you for choosing us and have a nice day. Hello?
