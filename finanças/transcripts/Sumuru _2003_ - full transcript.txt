Come on, Jake. There's got to be something down there. Give me some readings. Can't. Lower atmosphere radiation levels are too high. Without ground boosters, we can't even detect an elephant. Any word from the base? Nope. Still a white noise on all frequencies. Look, either these people are dead, out to lunch, or... Or what? Or they're just not in the mood to talk to us. After 900 years of no contact with Earth, who'd thunk, huh? Eh. Let's take a closer look. Atmosphere re-entry sequence initiated. You know, I've always said that deep space colonization... Deep space colonization is a bad idea. Well, from where I'm sitting, that fact we spread the human gene pool this far in the galaxy was a pretty good investment, huh? Are you going to tell them why we're here? Not yet, I want to assess the situation first. Oh, assess? What's to assess? I mean, down there is probably mankind's last hope. If they don't come to the party, we're all royally screwed. Stand by for entry. Sequence complete. Prepare for atmosphere re-entry. Tell me you can fix this. Radiation's knocked out all the nav systems. Entry program is offline. Manual override complete. Ah, OK. Remember flight school? Manual steering. Eh, just like riding a bull. Hold on tight. Hello, colonists! This is one hell of an introduction. We're losing altitude real fast. I gotta get the nose up. Burn forward thrusters. OK, three, two, one. Burn. Come on, baby. One last time. Come on, baby. We're still too steep, Adam. Jake, skids down, now! Ah, man, this is going to hurt. I'm taking the skids down. Wow. Hold on. Oh man. We have got to find a better way of getting from planet to planet. Forgot I was strapped down. Well, we can't stay long. I'm parked in the loading zone anyway, so... Lean on something. Lean on something. All right. Hold that. Oh yeah. Nice driving, Wade. Set you down over here. Oh yeah. Welcome to planet Antares, my ass. Ah! Get off me. What are you doing? Damn it, Jake, I'm a pilot, not a doctor. Yeah, baby. Oh, that's much better. Thank you. Here, hold this. Hm? Sorry about that. What's that up there? Where? What are you talking about? Looks like a dog. OK. Relax, Jake. You're all tranq-ed up. Planet of the dogs. Let's go check it out. Easy, easy trigger. Just... here. Hold this. Put it on there. I'll go... More... starbase should be... Come on. I'll tell you what. I'll go check it out. You stay here. Put pressure on that. Told you. The snake heads are behind us. OK. Don't be scared. Kid. Wait! Kid! Snake heads, huh? Yeah, maybe the snake heads will catch him, instead of us. You're late for sacrifice, boy. Run, dog, run! Get out of here! Take him away. Jake! You OK? Yeah. Just juicy. That was quite a ride. A good 6.2 on the old Richter scale. Yeah, I got that. What caused it? Let me guess. You need some geo scans, huh? Yeah, I'd appreciate that. You found anything yet? I'm not sure. I'll get back to you on that. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. Sumuru. We hail the great serpent goddess who shakes the heart of our world. We hail the great serpent goddess. All powerful snake mother, receive our offering of blood. All powerful snake mother, receive our offering of blood. Nice local wildlife. Sumuru. Queen of planet Antares. The serpent goddess returns the sun to our sky. We all thank the serpent for our sunrise. Bring out this sacrifice. The serpent is ready to feed. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Sacrifice, behold the serpent's face. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. Feed the goddess. No! Dove! He's my birth brother, Sumuru! Your brother. Hold them! They have defiled the ritual. Throw them all in the pit. Stop! You know the law, Taxan. Man kills so man can be killed, but not women. Your woman just defiled our holy sacrifice and she killed another woman. It was self-defense. She still has my protection. Order your women to back off, Taxan. I am goddess in this temple, and that male is my chosen sacrifice. You may be goddess in this temple, Taxan, but I am queen of Antares. The girl serves me. The boy is her brother. I hereby pardon him. You cannot pardon one whose body is promised to the snake mother. I just did. You want to battle, goddess, here and now? You found anything yet? Not a good time to talk. A male! Take him! Run, Will! Bring him to me alive. The ceremony is over for now. I want to be there when they find the stranger. Keep moving, kid. Ship's just over the hill. Jake! What's that? That's a star shuttle, kid. Go, go, go, go, go, go. OK, so you found the chicks. Did you have to piss them off? Shut up, get in, and lock the hatch! Who's your friend? Come on, kid. Get them! Whoa, whoa, Adam! Snake bite. That's bad. What are you doing? No. I have to! It's poisoned! Adam. Adam! Surrender yourselves! Stop! Lower your weapons. We take our orders from the serpent goddess herself. Taxan sent you to kill these men. Woman can kill man. It's the law. I am queen here, and those are my prisoners. I serve goddess Taxan. Then go back to her temple and tell her that those men are mine. Temple snake has bit him. What are you going to do? He's going to die. Point a weapon at me again, I'll kill you faster than that poison in your blood. This will kill the venom of the snake. Males. Put a guard on the starship, Dove. What about these males? These males, lady, are... Quiet! Get Search and Teller to have a look at that one and clean this one up. Going to question him later. Dog! Dog! Dog, where are you? Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog! Whoa, I thought you were the snake heads. I could have been. Didn't I tell you to stay out of the temple zone. But it's not me. It's dog. He keeps on running away. Will, you must stay away from the temple guards and the village, for that matter. Please. Since you've become Sumuru's bodyguard, I hardly see you any more. Will, it's because I'm Sumuru's bodyguard that I'm able to protect you. If it wasn't for the queen, Taxan would have fed you to the snake mother. I guess. If something like this happens again, Sumuru will choose another bodyguard. I'll be disgraced, and then how will I take care of you? But you always take care of me. Always. Now get out of here. If I can, I'll come and see you tonight. And tell me a story? And tell you a story. Whoa, whoa whoa, whoa. Hey, easy, girl. Hey. Hey. Hey. How are you doing? Strike one up for herbal medication. - You? - Oh, you know. My head feels like I crash landed on the planet, not the shuttle. What do you make of all this? Well, they speak our language, which means they were either descendants of the colonists or a tribe that was in close contact with them. But apart from the kid, the only people we've seen here are women. Maybe the gene virus got here before us and all the men are already dead. Nah. If the gene virus had eliminated their ability to reproduce, the last colonists would have died like 800 years ago. Somethings happening to the men... it's happening in this generation now. Listen, that's not the worst part. Hey, kid. Humor me. I did those geo scans you asked me for. The earthquake was no isolated incident. This planet is going through major tectonic changes... underground volcanoes, shifting magma flows, rapidly fluctuating magnetic fields. That explains why our sensors failed. Remember Krypton? Yeah. Remember what happened? Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This planet is cooked, Adam. These people need saving just as much as we do, and their time's running out. How long? I can't tell unless I know the frequency of their quakes. Educated guess, Jake! All right, two months... maybe three. Well, if the gene virus is already here, it really doesn't make a difference, does it? Hey, how's your med scan? Just a trace of the snake venom. No sign of viral antibodies. Let's see yours. Still negative, too. Hey kid, your name's Will, right? Yeah. 6.9. I was right. This planet is being torn apart. Oh, it's only the sacred snake moving. Is that right, huh? And this happens often? Yeah, all the time. Um, what was that thing you... Oh, I'll show you. Is it like an oracle? Can it tell things about me? It's better than an oracle. It tells us if you have a secret illness. Hey! What are you doing to my brother? Nothing. Just a simple med scan. He's... kid's in A1 shape. We need to talk to this queen of yours. After she bathes, the queen will interrogate him alone. Alone. Sounds good to me! So, sacred snake, huh? Careful. You could take somebody's eye out. - Quite a powerful weapon. - In the right hands. Out! - But your highness... - All of you. Not a difficult weapon to master for a queen. So what is your name? Adam. How's your leg? As good as new. You've got a way with snake bites. There are a lot of snakes in my world. So you told the boy you came on a starship? Yes. We landed because we needed fuel and... You didn't land, star man, you crashed. And your needs are the least of my concerns. Right. You speak our tongue. Where are you from? Came from a planet called Earth. It's far, far away. Earth. We also believe that your people came from there 1,000 years ago. 914, based on your calendar, to be precise. Slightly less than 700, by Antarean standard. Then you know about the colonists? Not much. My science advisors pieced some of it together. We have almost no records past the last 300 years. A lesser mind would think of it as magic. No, it's just science. It's a holographic projection. Tell me the story. An expedition from Earth... men and women set up a terraforming base here. It was the furthest outpost humans ever colonized, far from the trading routes. For 50 years, Antares star base sent reports back to our nearest colony on Sirius, and then all of a sudden, contact stopped. You never tried to find out what happened? There was a war, followed by another one right after it. When it was over, the people that survived needed about 200 years to rebuild civilization. Needless to say, an outpost at the furthest end of the galaxy was not our biggest priority. We've been out of touch with you for nine centuries. Mm-hm. Why have you come here now? I told you we lost contact with you. Why now? What do you want from us? Jake and I came here to help you and your people. Help us? How? Well, your planet is not in the best of shape. The core is unstable. The quakes. Yeah, they're not caused by that snake monster you've got in the pit. Is that so? We mine oil and gas deep in the rock. And every time our world shakes, my engineers measure every movement. But the sacrificial ceremony to the serpent goddess. Taxan? At one point, our people got so scared of the quakes that they turned to religion for an answer. Taxan has been feeding on that ever since. Taxan is... A living serpent goddess. It is her warriors who shot you. Ah. Seemed to be a lot more than political animosity between the two of you. Taxan has been groomed by her family to be queen. She comes from a fine blood line that produced four queens in three centuries. She considers my throne her birthright, but Antarean queen is not born, she is elected. And the people elected me. So instead of accepting defeat, she opted to form her own party. A bit of a sore loser. And a dangerous opponent. Well, she's not your biggest problem. Why? To put it bluntly, your planet's dying. That's the cause of the quakes. We need to evacuate your people and find them a new future. A new future where? Well there's plenty of other planets out there with oceans, forests, snow capped mountains. We want to help, but we need you to persuade your people to leave. How? On your starship? It's lying in the valley, crashed, burned, destroyed, like all man's dreams. What does that mean? It was written, long, long, ago, man brought the curse of darkness. Where are the men of your planet? Come on. I'll show you. The men of Antares. They're miners digging for the oil and gas we burn. The strongest ones are sometimes selected to maintain and broaden the cave passages. Boys and old men down here. Men have muscles, not brains. Men are workers. Women plan, organize, and make decisions. It's just the natural order of things. It's the natural order of things? We keep them alive. On their own, they'd never survive. Men don't have brains? Stop. Man brought the light of death upon us. The light was a judgment on man's pride. What the hell does that mean? It's our history. Men are born to work and women are born to rule. What about families, things like that? You don't have those? My women still mate with males. We have to reproduce. That's not what I meant. Well, that's all there is. You see what I mean? Little kiss before I end up in the gas mines? I didn't save your life to waste it in the mines. I want to learn more from you. It doesn't work like that. We came here in peace. Men never go anywhere with peace in mind. We have peace. You call this peace? I call this slavery. Now what? Stop! Have to do better than that. Lock him up! - And the other one, too. - Get up. Move! Kill all the guards. Bring the star man to me. My pleasure, goddess. Watch out! Ambush! Fire! Don't move, alien. Dove! Dove! Dove. Will. No, Dove, don't die. Please don't die. Will. Will. Don't die. I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you better. Will, it's important. Tell Sumuru what happened. Dove. Dove! Oh, Dove. Dove. Dove, don't die. Dove, Dove! Dove! I am Taxan, living serpent goddess, leader of the Antarean faithful. Yeah, well your women here just murdered some loyal Antarean faithful in the hallway. I liberated you from Queen Sumuru. It doesn't much feel like liberation. Leave. You fell from the stars? Yeah, you could say that. My warriors tell me you carry the most powerful weapon they have ever seen. Actually, your queen carries that now. You have other weapons in your starship? Maybe. Join me. To do what? Help me defeat the blasphemous Sumuru in the sacred name of the temple. Let me ask you a question. Is this a religious crusader or is this a personal thing? Sumuru believes in the ways of science, but science is the god of man, and man kills. Yeah, that's the second time I've heard this man kills theme today. You want to elaborate on that a little bit? What do you mean? What do I mean? What do I mean? Well, I don't know, that 900 years ago, this place was a thriving terraforming colony with farmers, scientists, family units... men, women, children, that sort of thing. What happened? Legend has it that the gods were angered by man's attempt to force his will upon the planet. Lightning fell from heaven. There was fire without flames and those too close were burned... mostly men. And the women just took over. We can rule Antares together. No, I think sharing with a man is against your religion. I am the living goddess. I make my own religion. Join me. What's that? - What? - It's a view screen. It's a relic from times gone. Whoa. Don't be afraid. They're my sacred children. Yeah? But they still bite. The penalty for killing my sacred serpents is death. Well yeah, you know, once bitten, twice shy. I just pardoned you. Magic! Yeah, sort of. It's a magic view screen. It's still got some juice left in its magic nuclear battery. Make it light up again. I can't. It looks like some of the magic transponders aren't working. Give me that magic. I don't think that's a good idea. I am Taxan. Obey me. Sorry, goddess. My magic. I see you're not into long running relationships, either. Guards! Take him. Chain him. Believe me, we will. You slaughtered my guards, Taxan. I have as much right to this male as you. Excuse me? Quiet! Quiet! You broke the first law... women never kill women. Soon, I'll be writing the law. Raise your hand against me again, and you'll answer to the faithful. It is you who is going to answer to the Antarean people. Your word against mine. Try and prove it. - Dove's brother is a witness. - So am I. Quiet! Men giving evidence against women? Ha! You're wasting your time. Fool. You're right. Oh! Should have done it a long time ago. Nice shot! Nice outfit. Don't even go there. We have to get out of here. We have to get out of this. Here they come! Taxan's warriors guard every tunnel between here and the City of History. City of History? You mean the burn zone? What are they on about? No idea, but apparently, there was some sort of catastrophic event hundreds of years ago called the Light of Death, which seems to be the key to their civilization. Light of Death, burn zone. According to our data, the colonists' command center had a quantum flux power reactor... way unstable by today's standards. You think there might be a connection? Come on, gotta go. Hey Will, let's go. Where's dog? He always comes back. And I'm sure he'll catch up with us, kid. It's just right now, we don't have the time to wait or to look for him, OK? OK? Come on, let's go. So what's this burn zone? Ancient buildings at the edge of our city. Legend says my people once fled from there. Fled? Yes, away from the Light of Death. This badge is handed down from queen to queen... a relic from the burn zone. It's an ancient faster than light cruiser, like a passenger transport version. There's something like this in the burn zone? That's what I'm hoping... a ship to get you both off my world. Come on. Wait, wait, wait. If there is a ship like this, we can take you and your people with us. You're rogue males here. I want you both gone before there's more trouble... more women dead. I will deal with Taxan and order will be restored. OK, brain boy, do you think you can figure out a way to fire up that ship after 1,000 years? Well, quantum flux reactor in the command center's probably shot, but the fusion generators might be operational. If we could get them powered up, then maybe we could, you know, charge the cells of the ship. What? You got a better idea? Well, it's insane and highly unlikely. And no, I don't have a better idea. You haven't forgotten we're supposed to take some of these people from Antares home with us. They're not going to cooperate with us. Right now, they just want us gone. You mean you haven't told her what's about to happen? I'm getting the feeling that a man's word is not worth too much on this planet. What about Earth? You know, gene virus. Well, that's not going to make a difference. They don't care whether we need them to survive or not. Back. Taxan has given the alarm to her warriors. All the tunnels are going to be sealed off. There goes that never hitting a woman thing. I don't know if hitting would have done any good. I mean, did you check the pecs on those chicks? Well, I know... What, what, what, what, what? I use to hide here from the Warriors. There was another way out. OK. Lead the way. Over here! Come, lift me up. OK. No guards. Come, let's go. There's no way we're fitting in there. What about that way? What's that light down there? We can't go that way. Why not? It leads to the surface. So? It's a way out. On the surface, we're going to be spotted kilometers away. - Trust me. - I don't get it. What's down there? There's a prison. A prison. Sumuru, what the hell is this? We're wasting time here. Keep on moving. These people are caged up like animals. That's the way things are on Antar-ass, Jake. The women rule and the men slave. That is bullshit. You would like it the other way around? Men brought the Light of Death. It was a judgement of man's pride. What are you on about? It's their history, Jake. Sh! Guys! We've got to get out of here before more snake heads spot us! Not now, kid. How do you open these gates? We don't. That wheel over there. Here! No, no, no. The other way! Adam, give us a hand here. Turn that wheel and I'll shoot you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on. Come on, easy. Jake, come on. That thing leaves a mark. I want you off my planet. OK, we don't have time to debate men's rights here. Men's rights? Snake heads! Jake, get that gate open! Give me my weapon. Give me my weapon! Destroying our order will not be your legacy. Are you the queen of all your people or just the better half? Get out of there! Go! Climb up, I command you! - Now what? - The surface. I thought you said we'd be spotted if we go to the surface. It's the only chance I've got. Come on! Fresh air. We cannot stay here. Taxan's warriors are right behind us. Where to? The burn zone. Let's go. Go, go! I got it. Appreciate it Antares. My home. I guess it's beautiful in a sort of Miami Beach kind of way. The zone is behind the mountain. Let's get going. They've freed all the males from the south gas mines. I sent warriors to the top of the shaft. Round up the slaves later. I went the traitor Sumuru and the alien heretics. You know you did the right thing back there, letting those men go. It was stupid. It goes against everything Antareans believe in. Then why'd you let us do it? I am present when a child is born on Antares. The moment the child leaves its mother is the last moment it is truly free. Seconds later, it will be decided whether the child will live as an outcast or as part of our society. To me, that always felt unjust. Yeah, well if sex is a gauge of somebody's worth, I'd say Taxan's a bad example of that. Still wasn't the right thing to do. And thanks to you, there's chaos. No chance of returning to the village. Oh, like we want to return to your village. - Like we even care... - Jake. Oh, come off it, Adam. You can't seriously be siding with her on this. Jake! Go for a walk. Go! All of you. Go, get out of here. Go. Keep moving. Come on. Yeah, for Jake, this is a little bit more than just personal. How so? When he was a kid, his parents were taken away and put in a slave labor camp. He knows what it's like to have nothing and be treated like nothing. Yeah, we're full of surprises. Better get going. Yeah, better get going. Snake heads! Run! Round up all those males! Forget them. Which way do you think they went? There's only one place Sumuru can take them... the zone. Goddess, we cannot enter the zone. You're under the serpent's protection. Follow me. You heard the orders. Move! Come on, boy. Your sister and I used to climb up this mountain when we were much younger than you. She never gave up. You mean Dove beat you? You don't beat your queen. But she could have. Damn these quakes. You know, this planet is really starting to piss me off. It's the snake mother. She's angry. There's a reason for that, boy. Our world is ending. Ending? What does that mean? This planet's old, kid, which means it can get sick, like people, and even die. That's why we've got to get you out of here, hm. Come on, let's go. You know, by now, Taxan probably has all your people up in arms against you. You'd be a lot safer coming with us. I can't. I do not rule my people, I serve them. And if I had to, I'd die for them. Whatever floats your boat. This is the furthest I've ever been. So how do you know where this burn zone of yours actually starts? Whoa! Hey, look what I found! We call him the keeper of the zone. When this guy died, I'd say about 900 years ago, his bones were glowing in the dark. We're OK, though, because quantum radiation dissipates real fast. Yeah, it's low levels now. The starbase power reactor was right next to the shuttle bay. Do you think that ship's systems are still going to be functional? Look, spacecraft are designed to withstand extreme cosmic radiation... even micro-asteroids. I'd say if she doesn't have a flat tire, we've got a chance. Nine centuries ago, this place had one hell of a quantum burst. I mean, this whole area must have been polluted. I'd say anyone in the vicinity of the command center must be dead within like three seconds. According to the databases, the women were working the terraforming fields further north. All they saw was a bright light. The fire without flame. Mm-hm. Light of Death. Uh-uh. Look, mystery solved, OK. The colonists blew themselves up, mostly women survived, and they just rebuilt society to their needs. Taxan! Let's go! Come on! We're moving out! Come on! Come on! Keep moving! Everybody OK? Yeah! Will? Will? Will! Come on. Careful, careful, careful, careful, careful. OK, let him down, let him down, let him down. He's still breathing. You with us? Scanning my body again, Adam? No secret illness, right? Just like before? - You betcha, kid. - Which sickness? I'll tell you later. No, now. Scan her, Adam. She'll read negative, too. That's up to her, Will. Do I pass your test? You're perfect. OK, now the truth. Your planet is dying. Our world is already dead. Earth? A gene virus... a long dormant leftover in our DNA from a gene war centuries ago suddenly became active. It destroyed our ability to procreate. There's no cure. There's no antidote. Over the last 60 years, human colonies all over the galaxy have diminished to the point of extinction. So you and Jake... We're two of the last clean humans left. Scientifically speaking, we're freaks of nature. Why did you come here? Your community is the only healthy gene pool large enough to support the survival of the human species. You came here to... You test negative for viral antibodies. So did Will. There's no trace of the gene virus here. You're our last hope... you and your people. If we leave without you, there is nowhere we can go. Help us. Let's find the ship first. We're here. Adam, check it out. The radiation levels are radical. Looks like they've altered the reflective qualities of the zone. OK. Reactor's just behind this door. Shuttle bay just beyond that. Control circuits are all blown. There's no response. Aw, forget it. OK. Stand back. After you, ma'am. There it is. Follow me. Well? What are you waiting for? Anyone else care to disobey me? Guys, I found it. Over here. Whoa. Think you can get the power up? Hey, I was right. The quantum flux reactor did blow. Must have been one heck of a quantum wave. Didn't seem to have damaged most of the equipment, though. OK. Everybody cross your fingers and pray that the fission generators are still functional. Yes, please! You didn't think mother nature would spare an idiot from extinction, did you? Oh. No comment. Look, it's a pretty primitive setup. How many guys that you know could operate machinery that's almost a millennium old, huh? OK. Let's clean this baby up. Come give me a hand here, kid. Relax. It's just rocket science. How long before you can power up the cruiser? It's going to take me a while to figure out if the system is stable, and I'll get back to you on that one. Let's go see if your ancestors left some horses in the stable. I'll tell you later. Not bad for 1,000 years old. Or many moons or whatever you guys call it. Oh yeah. I'm going to need a vintage manual for this one. Power's low. We're definitely going to need Jake's generators. Cover your eyes. I keep praying we're getting out of here. Who says I'm going with you? You have no future on this planet. What future will I have with you? You'd have a chance. A second chance? That's up to you. It's humming, Jake. Ah! Welcome back to the age of interstellar travel and holographic swimsuit catalogs, kid. Cata-what? Cata... you know, a planet of bootylicious-ness and you're not even old enough to appreciate it. That is a tough break, kid. OK. Let there be light. All right! Let's get this baby powered up and get the hell out of this hellhole. Adam, we've got generator power. Adam, you copy? Yeah, we copy, Jake. You ready for power? Yeah, juice up cruiser power storage. I will fire up the on-board reactor. I'm on it. Oh, and Adam. Yeah. Tell that queen friend of yours that I checked the base logs up until the accident. The quantum reactor blew because of a structural weakness with the inner tubing. Probably a freak reaction to the planet's more offbeat radiation. But no judgment, no Light of Death, and sure as hell no fault of the engineers... male or female. Yeah, thanks for the info, bud. So we were wrong all along. It's natural. I think after a disaster, everyone looks for someone to blame. I guess it helps to channel pain into anger. That's human. But our society... our beliefs... it's all based on a mistake? Yeah, I think most of Earth's cultures were based on a mistake of some form or other. It's making the best of it that counts. Maybe now you can do that. I'm drawing power to the cruiser's storage cells. Now hopefully, that'll give Adam enough juice to power up the ship's reactor. What can I do for you, Jake? You can keep an eye on those radiation readouts for me. Now see, we've got to keep them below that red line. See? Because if we don't, they're going to blow, and our chances of powering up the cruiser - are going to blow with them, OK? - I'm on it. You know, I think you're going to enjoy wherever it is we end up going. Yeah. I just wish dog's here. Hey. It's going to be OK. We're going to get out of here, and then you and I have a date for some serious fun. Eyes, watch. Jake. Yeah. Jake, I think I heard something. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's the deal? You're supposed to be watching the readouts. Yeah, but Jake, I really think I heard something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. Red line, kid. Go, go, go, go, go. Adam, stand by. Sending you maximum power. Copy. Sequencing cruiser reactor. Hit those two keys first. That one, then that. These? Up there! Adam, what's your reactor reading? 82% power. Ready to fly in five. You got a problem? My readings are redlining. I don't know if I can contain this antique. Initiate shut down sequence. I'll give you go as soon as I can. Copy. Stand by reactor shutdown sequence, kid. Stop! Adam! Snake attack! Snake attack! Taxan. Jake, no! No! I've got to shut the reactor down! Where's the traitor, Sumuru? Over here, Taxan. She's mine. You've been queen too long. You want my crown, Taxan? It should always have been mine! Then come and take it. Adam! Generator's in the red. - This place is going to blow. - How long? - Five minutes, max. - Power up the cruiser. Get those blast gates open. Go now! Come on! OK. Let's see if this vintage baby wants to fly. Sumuru! That generator's going to explode. We got to get out of here. Launch power up and blast gates open. Ow. That had to hurt. We got to go. Go, go! What can I do, Jake? Watch and learn, kid. Sequencing engine start up. Vertical thrusters. No touching. OK. Please baby, please baby. Vertical thrusters firing. Yes, please. Yeah, didn't see that one coming. Full vertical thrust. Checking main engines. You getting all this technical shit, kid? No, not really. That's OK. Neither does Adam. All righty. Give it to me, baby. Yo! We just got ourselves a ride out of here, kid. Yes, please. I can't hold these thrusters on standby. Where the hell are they? Here they come! Go, Jake! Go, go, go. Blast gates are lowered. - We've got full thrust. - Everybody hang on. Is it at all possible you miscalculated the timeline for this planet? I hate to admit it, but I just had the same thought. Let's hope I can navigate this thing through a shaking blast door. Jake, you want to do a systems check and find out how far this piece of fine, vintage machinery will take us, please? I'm on it. Everything is going to be OK. We've got a full manifest here. Enough... yeah, enough for a jump to Sirius. You mean you're flying through the stars? You got it, kid. Next stop, Sirius station. Hey Jake, take over. Kid, come get your first flying lesson. Those are my people down there. Listen, I know we lied to you about our reasons for coming here. Men lie, women lie. There was deceit and treason in my own circles. But you saved my life. You saved mine. I never needed anybody's help before. Well, maybe it's not about needing someone's help. But about wanting it? Jake, set us down on that hilltop near the temple. Yeah, but the quakes are getting worse. We... I know. OK, but we can't stay long. You know, there's room in this cruiser to pick up survivors. For all of us? Well, it might be a little crowded, but you want to decide who lives and who dies? Not anymore. On your feet. Stand up, all of you. We are going on a great journey together. It's not one we want, but one we have to take, nevertheless. We're going to the stars. To the stars. My queen. You lost this. I don't want it anymore. OK, any time, people. Can we move it along, please? OK, someone tell me when we're set to go because I don't trust this planet. Almost there. What the hell was that? A quake, Adam. I told you. Oh, you got to be kidding me. That was no quake. Don't ask. I'll tell you later. Aw, man. I knew this was too good to be true. Look. If that thing damages our thrusters, we're stuck down here. You realize that? Fire up the left parking booster. What? Just do it! Whatever. All right. And on the menu tonight, ladies and gentlemen, southern fried snake. Three, two, one. Bite me! Bite me? Let's get the hell out of here. OK, commander Will. Butt in the chair, eyes on the screen, hands on the controls. And pull back real slow. Like this. You got it. Cool. So you enter your data. The nav control plots a trajectory. And look. There's your course to Sirius. And after that? After that, pick a star, kid. OK. Dog? Dog? Oh dog, I thought I'd never see you again! He was at the ladder to the surface, barking like crazy. I thought there must be something or someone really special up there, and well, if there wasn't, hey, I could use some company. Oh, thank you so much! Oh, dog. Guys! Guys, look at my dog! Hey, he found you! Oh, cute little dog. What's his name? Dog. Dog? Dog. It's a name. A universe. Ours for the taking. Let's hope we don't screw it up.
