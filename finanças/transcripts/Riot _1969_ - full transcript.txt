Briston, who moved this gin pole? Yesterday it was on the other side. Lieutenant Becker gave us the okay to send it up from here. Well, Becker's not running the shop line, I'm running it. You take your orders from me around here. Get that gin pole back on the other side where it belongs, up there. Briston. Get back here. How'd this get here? You got me, Sarge. You're damn right I got you. Hey, there are over 200 guys in the shop line, man. I saw you hide it. Look, I've been under gun all morning, Sarge. Come on, we're gonna hash this out with warden. If you take me to him, it's back to isolation, you know that. Come on, boy. Hey, Sarge, when do I get some help? These guys in here want their buckets changed. People in hell want ice water. See Lieutenant Becker. Boys in isolation need a snood full of gas, that'll shut 'em up. They got the word. - I wanna see the warden. - That's it. The warden's gone, gone to Honolulu. Somebody shoulda told me. Out in the blue Pacific right now, him and the misses. How come he didn't take you with him, Grossman? Who's the acting deputy? John Fisk. Let's go. Well, I'll let you off with a warning, Briston. Go on back to your work assignment. Consider yourself lucky. I want this man taken off the roof tarring gang, Mr. Fisk. He's a troublemaker, and he's always shooting angles. - We'll discuss it later, Grossman. - I'd like to get a settle now. If he goes back to work, he's gonna be strutting all day. Briston has a bad mouth, sir. He called me some pretty nasty names this morning. You didn't mention any profanity in your report. Well, I thought the boy was in enough trouble without mentioning that he called me a hunky son of a bitch and worse. You're goddam lying. You see that? You see? Look, he gets his kicks off of riding me. Do you see that? You see? Listen, I try to be fair, and there's a lot of stuff - I leave outta my reports. - Well, yeah. Yeah. I didn't say it, but you are a sadistic son of a bitch! Key up! Key up! I'll be damned if I'm waiting for that greenhorn to get done making his rounds. Let me have your key, Galloway. You know darn well that door's supposed to be open from the inside only. - The key! - I won't hand it to you. Help yourself, you're on your own. I've been opening doors around here for 20 years. Guard! Guard! Get him, Cully! Traitors! Keep it cool. Keep it cool! Get that phone off the hook, man. Go! Get the ones in the office upstairs. Hey, Cully. Nice going, baby, nice going. Put him in a cage, man. Let him see what it's like to smell three-day old buckets. Alright, you heard the man. Go. Please let me out of here, I won't say nothing. Get up! Get up or I'll cut your throat out! Would you cool it. Listen, get back in there and work on that wall now, come on. Let's kill him. He's got coming! Who let you outta your cage? Hey, I'm in charge of the action now. You get back there and work on that wall. We'll cut him later. Come on. Come on, get moving. Hey, come you guys, get in here. Put him in a cage, man, then you work on that wall. Hey, Red. Red, Captain Molesky is having a heart attack or something. I could get a murder rap, you know? - Is he still breathing? - Breathing? Man, he's puffing like a steam engine. Come on, forget that, will you? Get in there and help 'em with those bricks. Come on, come on, come on. Hey! Couple of you guys, check on the front wall. Keep your eyes open, right? Fraker. I'm telling you, send to the hospital for a doctor, if anything happens to Captain Molesky, I'm gonna hold every damn one of you responsible for this. Up yours. Get him outta here. Hey man, it's working. Come let's go. Come on, let's go. Hey, Red, what's going down, man, how'd you guys get outta your cell? Listen, would you believe Bugsy conned that halfwit screw into opening his cage? I told him my bucket was leaking. Soon as he opened my cell, I grabbed his keys and slugged 'em inside. So he lets me out, saying the he swung the rest of 'em. How many of 'em? Oh, 17, and us. Yeah, that's all cool, man, but you shoulda left that foolish Indian locked up. - No, no, no. - We need him. That's right. We're gonna bust out, man. Right over the wall. Just us, just isolation. Yeah, 19 guys over the wall in broad daylight? Well, your boys don't know yet. You're in it. In what? You got 10 miles to the mountains over a flat, open land, and that's after you go across a wall that's got guard towers on both ends. Man, you guys are crazy. We grab some trucks and the towers will be on fire. - Hey, Red, there's a bull on the walk. - Hey, man. Get down. Get Seth the punch him out. He's going in hospital. Hey man, I didn't know the score. I thought we were just gonna wreck the joint. Well, I ain't chicken, I'm going if the rest go. Not me, I'm only doing five years. You were doing five years, Coorise. You're in this now, baby. You're in it. Yeah, buddy. Now what do you say? Okay. I go with you studs as far as the mess hall. But I'm not going near that goddamn wall in daylight. That's right, it's suicide. Well, how do we handle those gun towers? Molotov cocktail. All right, the construction gang's in it with us. We'll get some jars of gasoline, we'll get some rope, and there's a grappling hook. It's all stashed in the construction shed. You had, Red? - Give. - Man, I shoulda known you guys. Come on, man, what is it? The guards found that stuff yesterday, man, and hauled it out front. Did you see it yourself? From the roof of the mess hall. Come on, man. It's no sweat. Big Red will think of something? Red? Come on, now. We still got a chance, what... Hang up that telephone. You two guys, come on. Get out the front door and, unlock it. Anybody comes in, you grab him, right? Hey, Kelly, you sure you didn't miss anyone upstairs? How? Well, I don't know, man. What about the assignment lieutenant? Man, he wasn't in that office. Kelly, you and Big Head, get upstairs. Galloway control. Send him over. Hey, Red, who is that? The bull in CB4. 23-5-11's got a bellyache and he gotta go to the hospital. He needs a pass. Hey, that reminds me, what about Molesky? That dude's in bad shape, Red. I gave him some of those pills he had in his jacket, didn't do any good. Well, stay with him, man. The man needs a doctor, Red. Somebody better call the hospital. All right, call a doctor. But once he gets over here, he stays. No going back and forth. That goes from Molesky too. Smell 'em, baby, smell 'em! They don't like the smell of 'em. Easy, easy. Take it easy, man. Just loosen 'em up, so when we ready to go, they'll all go at once. We're almost ready now, Red. When, when it's time, man, when it's time. Listen, this is our show. There isn't anybody else in the prison knows anything that's happening. So you just loosen them up, you got it? Hey, come here. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. So we go into the hole into the mess hall, so what? What you mean, so what, man? We'll get some gasoline or some kerosine, I mean, anything that'll burn. If we go outta the back of the mess hall, over the wall, and that's maybe. If nothing will go over the wall, we'll get into the motor pool and we'll steal a truck, and we're into the mountains, and then we scatter. Man, that's sloppy. Red, that's sloppy, you gotta tighten that up. Listen, Cully, listen to me, man! I got 17 of the toughest cons in this prison or any other prison, and we can do this, man, we can do it! Gimme the keys. Gimme the keys. What do you want the keys for? You said later, Red. That's now. All right, listen to me now, Joe, listen to me, man, we're not in any real... - Grossman! - Hey! I want you. Come here. And you said we needed that kid. For what? For the mountains, man, he's a... - What about the mountains? - I'll tell you about the mountains. You wouldn't last two days there. There's no roads, there's no water, nothing. Listen, we'll shake the rest of 'em, right? Then it'll just be the three of us. Yeah. Yeah, Joe's got the secret of all the Indian trails, the caves, the springs. - Tell him later. - Tell me now. On the other side are my people. That's food, transportation, I know the border... ...speak Spanish, you wanna get to Mexico. All these ifs and maybes. Look, Red, if something goes wrong, we need those guys as hostages. I want Grossman! - You hack bastard of a... - Joe, take it easy. - Gimme the keys, man! - Hey! - You! You! - Don't you ever! Don't you ever pull a knife on a partner. Don't you ever pull a knife on a partner. Now, go! Man, he's gonna put a shiv in you, you better watch it. The hell with him. What about Molesky? Come on. I gave him a couple of them pills he carries around, but. He'll have to be taken to the hospital. Nobody leaves this building. You want him to die? Nobody dies, Doc. You want something, you get on a horn, you have it send over here. This man's got to have breathing apparatus and oxygen. He's got to have intensive care. Look, Doc, will you give us your word you won't tip off the towers? I've got no other choice. I'll give you my word. Well, that's good enough for me, Red. Missed you, Cully. Now, Mary, be nice. Hey, it's the drag queen. Mary, where's your dress? She'll be wearing it soon enough, Jugger. He's a big one. Come on, come on, Mary, the bigger they are, the better you like it. Shut up. And to you, sweetheart, the name is always Sheldon. Hey, where's your lipstick, Mary? He's so young. Mary, you girls still throwing those little parties? Oh yes, you glorious creature. We've certainly missed you... And yours. Hey! We've got hostages here, doctor. And we... Do you understand? One peep outta you, or either one of these two... Red, you ought to know better than that. Hey, Red, some son of a bitch stooled. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Right, so we didn't make it one way, we'll make it another. We're gonna crash out of here. All we needs is a little time. Gimme some more manpower. We're gonna make 'em think it's something else. A riot? A protest for better conditions. A riot. I don't care what they call it. We've got hostages. One shot inside these walls, and you'll bury them. There's certain unjust conditions in isolation. We're gonna draw up a list of grievances that'll be presented to you shortly. This is not a riot. I repeat, this is not a riot. This is an orderly demonstration in preparation for negotiations. We formed a committee, they'll contact you by telephone. All right, all right! Come on, no sweat, man, they're not gonna shoot. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Gigolo, I be right behind you, baby. Come on, come on. Hey, Red. Look what Kelly found in the warden's desk. Hey, man, that's speed. The guards must've nailed another smuggler, Red? Now what are you gonna do, trip out? I thought you has some planning to do. Come on, man, that's speed. Speed's an upper. Come on. Come on. Well, yeah! Hell's getting better. - Beer. - Beer! Beer! Beer! Beer! Hey, it's all over the radio already. Hey, hold it. They said a handful of dangerous encourageables busting outta isolation. Hold it, hold it, hold it. They say we beat the hell outta 25 hostages. Hold it, hold it, hold it. And threatened the peaceful cons with knives and clubs. Hey. Hey. What is a handful of dangerous what? Dangerous encourageables. - What's that? - Beats the hell outta me. I'm not an encourageable, I'm a prisoner! Hold it down. Hey! Dummy up, dummy up, Big Red has got something to say. Come on, you pill heads, hold it down. We got the inside, they got the walls, right? Right! Hey, I just took another look at the wall and all the farmers of the country are up there, they got rifles and shotguns. How many hostages are there? Hostages: The deputy warden, five guards, and Murray, he makes it seven. Murray? That psychologist, the civilian. He's sitting there in his office, he said the whole thing sounds very interesting. That's Very good, because we're gonna give him such a snow job and use him as a go-between, right? Yeah. Right! A tunnel. How about a tunnel? Mary, where yous cracking up? Hey, that's an idea, why work at night? Hell yeah, we can come up 50 yards from the joint. And we're gonna hold out here for a couple of days. We're gonna write up a list of grievances, and while they're reading our gripes, we're gonna be digging that tunnel, right? Hey, we'll get the finks and the baby rapers to dig it. Great idea. I'm dreaming. Hey, Kelly, how's it look? It looks beautiful, baby, we're in like Flynn. Beautiful. Beautiful. I'm telling you, I've been all around those yards, and they must have real tight orders not to shoot. I've been all around under that guns. Okay, right now, the grievances. Now, who's gonna write 'em up? Who, who can type here? Hey, Cully. What's the guys name in, who writes the paper, you know, writes all that rehabilitation crap, what's his name? - Skinny Brown. - Skinny Brown. - Skinny Brown who runs the newspaper. - That's right. Yeah. He's one of the most solid cons in this joint. And you're jumpy, I didn't say he wasn't. Oh, come on, half of that stuff he writes in that paper is crap, Red? How would you now, stupid? You can't even read. Hey, forget it, forget it! You tell Skinny to write up a list of grievances and why we're writing, and you tell him to hurry, so we can pass it out front, let 'em know we mean business. Hey, where's Joe Surefoot? Hey, Cully, what's going on? - What's going on out there? - Nothing, man. Hey, Skinny. - Cully. - Look, the guys want... Listen, you're doing five years, keep outta this. It's too late now, Skinny. Who's running the show? Big Red Fraker's running the show, Skinny. Who sucked you in? Fox and Champs. It figures. What he get you to do? Well, I, jumped Grossman and, looked up some hostages and a few other things. You in, all right. Now they want to involve me? Cully, I'm doing life, I've got nothing to lose, except this. So let's here it. The guys want you to, type up a list of grievances. We enjoy the unique privilege of incarceration under a man who can not be replaced. You know about the warden's deal. He's got lifetime job. Nobody, not the governor, not even the president can pull him out of his appointed office. We have him in perpetuity, but we do have grievances. It's just a rough outline to start the ball rolling. Yeah, well, it's rough all right. Look, Skinny said he'll have a five, six-page petition in just a couple of hours. Well, look, he's got the chow, and then the buckets, down here at the bottom of the page, then it says, "Unbalanced diet." Man, we're eating garbage! What about the gas? Yeah, there's not a word about the gassings, and now, Skinny knows, as well as you and I, that we've been gassed in isolation. Not a word about it. Then he says, "The need for another headshrinker." Oh man. On the job training. Man, forget it. Mister, we shoulda have drew up our own goddamn list? Look, man, you wanna bitch, don't bitch to me. Now, I've run my little errand, so if you guys wanna type up your own petition, type it up. This will have to do, I guess. Anyway, what's all a fuss about? It's just a stall until we start the tunnelling, right? Hey, man, cool it. Dummy up. Come here. I don't trust these mainline cons, man. We started the tunnel. Where? In the back of the auditorium. I mean, it's an old one, it's like 25, 30 years old. - You mean they're actually digging it? - Yeah. - Coorise, hey, man, what's happening? - Hey, Red! Bugsy needs help. I thought he guarding the hostage. He was, man, till them cats from those cell houses started ganging up in isolation. Like they got knife, like to get into hostages and we get to blame. Thought that cell block was locked? Man, some white men went after Sledge, man, and Bugsy's like... Hey, stick around. Look, you handle it, man, I got something too. Well, this is an emergency. Well, you take care of it, Red. No, well, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait minute. Come here. Listen to me. Come here, come on. We got over 30 guys that can... Hey, they got a TV set up back there. Hey, come on. Hey come on. Let's get some pictures there. Hey, hey, hey, come on. Now, they're waiting for me, I'd handle this myself. Hey, Red, Bugsy needs help, man. You know how he is. Show him neck, and still he'll turn the other one. He's got the key to the cell too. I thought you had the key. Come here. Come on. Look, if they close in on him, man, he's gonna give it 'em, and then, and then they're gonna be right in there, see? Now, I want you to handle this personally. It's a kinda thing that you can swing better than anybody else in the joint. Get in the mess hall, back of the mess hall, in the flower mill, and they'll be safe there. Now, if the guys can't see the hostages, they're not gonna be thinking so hard about getting to them, right? Am I right? Yeah, you're right, man, you're right. - Coorise. - Yeah. You get Skinny Brown to tell 'em to meet me at the front gate with the rest of that petition. All right, Red. Get the hell away from me now. Give us the key, Bugsy, I'll send you some cotton to help you get straight. How about it? - I ain't got no key. - We know you have it. Look, will you get that, that, get that shiv away from me, will you, come on? The key. Now get out of my way! Who's next? Who's next? Come on. Come on. I've got no shank. Now who's gonna pick up that key? I've got no shank and I've got no patience, now come on! What are you trying to do, Cully? Weren't you supposed to have a good time? Let me hear you repeat that. Hey, who's side are you on? You think Fisk is gonna parole you for this? For God sake, Cully, get me out of here. Hey, Punchy, get over here. Get over here and bring a couple of guys with you. Now pick up that key and open the cell. All right, now hear me good. Most of you punks have never been in a hole before, but you're going around waving steel, talking about cutting guards! Do you know what that means? Bull lover! If you wanna cut something, cut each other! It makes me no nevermind, because nobody's gonna give a damn. But if you cut one of these men, we all have to pay. You dumb, dumb cotton head, loud mouth punks. Get 'em out here, Bugsy. Right, you guys heard Cully, now move it, come on. Now look, now I've been nice, but I'm thinking of scoring a base off of somebody's head! Get the hell outta here! Come on! Get out! Come on, move it! Come on out. Stay in a group, we're gonna move you to a safer place. Mr. Briston, I'd like to talk to you and Mr. Fraker, not as a prison psychologist, but as a friend. Grossman. Why Grossman, you've wet your pants. My heart, for God sake, take me to a hospital. You can stay here, Surefoot will be along in a little while and I'm sure he'll take care of your heart. Cully? Cully? - Listen. - Move 'em out, Punchy. Come on, Grossman. Now listen, now listen, Red. Listen, Red, are any of the hostages dead? No, none, none of the hostages are dead. Have any of them been injured? No, none of them been injured. And none of 'em will be injured either. As long as the authorities respect our to negotiate. Get up, dickheads! All right, spread out. I said, spread out! Come on, gentlemen, get outta the way. Come on, upstairs. For God sake, Cully, let me go home to my wife. Stop crying, Grossman. I'm a sick man. Look, Grossman. For over four years I've watched you crack the whip around here, now all of a sudden you're sick, old man. Come on. Cully, Big Red wants to know if we got the hostages stashed? They're up top. Punchy's guarding 'em. We've been on television, Big Red and me. Oh, what about the other guys in isolation? Some of 'em are digging a tunnel. It's all over the world, about our riot. Who's riot? Our riot. Yours and mine and Big Red's, I guess. There over 1200 guys in this joint, kid. And you and me in Big Red are rioting? Well I got news for you, kid. As of now, it's you and Big Red, because I'm gonna go and brew me a batch of raisin jack. Raisin Jack? How much you gonna make? Can I help you? Well, we can't disappoint our public, now can we, kid? So, we've gotta brew enough to turn on the whole joint? Come on. The way she working now, she'll have a nice kick come morning. How much raisin jack is this? Well, I'd say about 800 gallons. Be better off making soup and beans and oatmeal, what these pots were meant for. Gonna be a lot of hungry cons crowding in here. Well, if they're hungry, let 'em try this on for size, man. Pure health food, you know, we got some figs, and prunes, and raisins, and apricots. Did I leave anything out, Moonshine? Yeast. Yeah, real pure, rich yeast, man, guaranteed to be full of vitamins and minerals and, let's see, what are them pills now? - Them pills, them pills... - Mood elevators. That's right, Rick, baby, mood elevators. You gonna elevate the mood of the entire population, right, Moonshine? Man, this tunnel is an old mother. I need some more boards over here, man. Hey, get some more boards down here! Keep that air coming! One of the lifers showed us where it was filled in around the start of World War II. Guys that dug it, they're all dead or gone. Man, I don't know how it stayed a secret all these years. Pure luck. Yeah, I guess it was luck that first plan blew up, man. Hey, how far does she go and how long will it take? She goes in there, and then cuts around that way, and then straight towards the back outside wall. Yeah. We've got a good 90 feet with the last measurement. 90 feet! And that's cutting it damn close. Most of that was the easy stuff. The guys who filled it in, they kept it loose and left some of the old shoring in. But we're in the pact earth now. Man, that's slow. Yeah, but is safe, man? What's safe? Come on. Where do these go? Number three and four gun towers, they carry steam in the winter. Towers, hey? That's right at the wall. Well, why couldn't we go from there to the outside? Solid concrete, they'll hear us drilling. Overhead. You mean where the pipes, lead into the tower? There's manhole covers, the guards will lift them up and gas us like rats. Well, if we don't swing this deal, that's what they're gonna do anyway. Well, you just do the jiving, Cully. Hey, has anybody gotten the word on us yet? No, man, we made this place strictly off limits. They wanna know what's happening in here, I tell 'em the strategy committee's handing out work assignments, they buzz off. Beautiful. Man, here's that stinking snitch guy from Duke Tuesdale. Throw it in the evidence file. Man, I never did trust that loud mouth punk. Hey, get a load of this one. Two goddamn pages. It's the brand-new queen they got working down in the library, you know, that horseface blond. The flitter says... Throw it in the pile, we'll her it later. You know what? It looks like to me, half the guys in this joint are snitching, and they're worried about the other half. Yeah, but that's all gonna be straightened out. Goddamn right it's gonna be straightened out. We should bust some heads before this is over. How's she coming, fellas? Hey, Cully, Red and the others are looking for you. They're having a meeting at the barbershop and they want you in on it, right away. She's coming along fine. Here's a so-called good convict. Told you about him five years ago and you wouldn't believe me. We put at the top of the list and knock his sticking punk head off. Oughta cut it off. You guys planning a head ripping session? - Yeah. - Sure are. You want the number one grievance, Murray? It's sex. That's it, pure and simple. Would you believe that I haven't been laid in seven years? No. Mr. Briston, Mr. Fraker is showing me a detailed list of the grievances, and I must say, it fills this entire affair in a different light. Now, I'm gonna take him with me to the next press meeting. I'll do everything I can to help you men. Just so you don't get carried away by his fair, sweet promises? Look, I'm for reform, Mr. Briston. Yeah, well, I understand that, but you don't wanna rush into any quick agreements with them now, do you? Right, Red? Oh, yes, all the convicts previously had been double-crossed in their negotiations, so we're gonna let the press know everything. Once this riot is over and that gate is locked tight, the public will hear just what the warden wants them to hear. No, that's not entirely true, Mr. Brown. You are new here, Murray, you don't know that warden. Yeah, and when he comes back, we are going to hear about it. Yeah, he's gonna gas this joint, and I mean all of it this time. Not just those of us from isolation. But that would injure the hostages. Oh, goddamn it, Murray. What the hell? Look, what do you think, we're telling you some kinda a scary story? The warden doesn't give a damn who he hurts. Why in the hell do you think we're staging this thing while he is away? We've gotta hammer one thing home. No reprisals. No reprisals and, and, and no punishment for the leaders. What leaders, man? Well, Red, and me, and Kelly, and Jonesy, and you, Cully. You're wrong, man, I ain't no leader. Oh, "I ain't no leader." Get a load of our humble hero. You've saved our lives this afternoon, Mr. Briston. I ain't no leader. You're a hero, Cully. And when you face those loud mouths down today, you also became a leader. Hey, Jake, how you doing? Okay, Cully. I heard something about riot. I think that's BS. Everybody's talking. Man, you're famous. For what? The raisin jack. Man, damn. Now that part is tough. Gee! Look, you gonna let me in on it? In what, Jake? You've only got, six more months. That's right. Well, go on, eat your sandwich. Cully, you've got something going. Look, Jake, I split my chow with you and we split this cell, but I don't want you in it. Why not? Because I'm in deep, and I'm getting in deeper just while I'm lying here. Now it's like I thought of this whole thing myself. I'm never gonna get parole, Jake. I know that now. I'm never gonna walk out of this place. Never. It's just like Kelly in the others. You know, they get mixed up in one thing and then they get mixed up in something else, then it's something else, and pretty soon the sentence goes up and up and, I don't know. And here I am, involved in this million to one shot that I would've passed up this morning. But now I've gotta take it. Escape. And I don't wanna split that with you, Jake. I don't want you involved in any part of it. Listen, fruit, I told you, let him sleep. But it's his party. Back to queen's room, Mary, before you get hurt. Cully, dropped by for a drink. He ought to see the miracle that has been wrought in this old whorehouse. Freeze, daddy. If it'd been anybody, just anybody else, pow! But somehow I just can't bring myself to slug a queen. Aphrodisiac. Yeah, it's raisin jack. Come on, Cully, I got something I wanna show you. Did you get this at the mess hall? Yeah. Like? What are you drinking? Relax. We can lock ourselves in and draw the drapes. I've been wanting to talk to you alone. Come on, Cully. I have got a jug. A whole jug. Just for me... ...and you. Not bad stuff, Cully. Yeah, man, you and Moonshine ought to go in the brew making business when you get outta here. How come you let him get started so soon, Moonshine? I told 'em stuff wasn't ready to drink. Cully. Here. Try it. It don't taste good, but it got a pretty good kick. Easy does it. Don't worry, it's all okay. Our stuff ain't got no more kick than beer or wine. It'll get you drunk as any lush on skid row? Yeah, you're absolutely right. Frankly, Mr. Fraker, I'm worried. I know you're going to need your wits about you for the next meeting. Tell you an interesting fact, if you don't already know it. More than 70% of the men in the penitentiary has committed their crimes while under influence of alcohol. Yeah, I was drunk. Your offence was, rape, wasn't it? Well, that's what they said. Look, I see, saw this bimbo in court. And I mean, I mean, if I was drunk enough to get the hots for her, I must have been too drunk to do anything about it. Hey, Red. Take a look, man. Oh, I'm cutting this off, right now. What do you mean by cutting it off, man? No way. Things are getting bad in there, man. But that's good, man. Action make distraction. Listen, Cully, listen to me. It makes me look like I'm representing a bunch of bums. You are, Red. - You are, man. - What do you mean? Look, don't let that faggot psychologists tell you any difference, that's what you're doing. You just don't understand. Now look, what you are running at the gate is a put on, is just a cover up. Yeah, but what's happening in here, man, makes my job out at the gate that much harder. What's going on here is a put on too, man. Look, Red, I got those guys stoned, just like we want 'em. Now we got 'em outta our hair, right? - Right? - Yeah. All right. And everything's cool? It, look, there's like 100 things that can happen all here, man. You gotta handle those one at a time, man. Yeah, how about that one thing that we can't handle, man, then we're screwed. That's why we gotta hold our cool, man. If we hold our cool, we're not gonna get screwed. Right? Right, big babe? Yeah, right. All right. Are you all right? Hey, lighten up on that stuff, men. No one on my crew gets stoned. Understood? We'll all get loaded and get laid real? - Hey, how she coming? - We're getting there. Good. Come here. - Now, you get outside the wall yet? - Yeah, we've made it. How far? 15, 20 feet. - Where are you planning on coming up? - Other side of the motor pool. When? We'll be there sometime this afternoon. Now wait a minute. Hold off breaking through the surface until sundown. Okay, good. Now, how many of those guys are coming with us? Just three. Then there's you and Red and who else? Bugsy? Yeah, Bugsy, Kelly and Surefoot. You're crazy, man. Well, that's the deal. That's the deal. Cully! Cully! Somebody up there, trying to get to the hostages. Joe, come one step closer and I will let you have it! Everybody's always talking about a chance to get him, and the chance is now, and you are standing here protecting him! Hold it, Joe! Mind your own business, Briston! Look, Joe, don't forget about Mexico, now. You know, you punched me out before. - Now, take it easy, Joe. - But you never gonna punch me out again. Now what, we gonna leave him lay there till he comes to? I guess I'll have to put him some place where it'll be safe for him and us. You wait here, I'll send someone to take a look at you. I say where are they? Where are the sneaks? Are there sneaks? Are there sneaks? Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack! Please! Bloody screamers. Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack! Big stoolie. Dirty, rotten stoolie! Please! Stop screaming! Go get 'em, big boy. Let's get another one. Which one? Big Joe. I've looked over this list of grievances, and I think everyone listed is warranted, and I'm asking you to approve it. Are you outta your mind? You go all in the hole. Have you seen item two, about an inmate committee? Is this an agenda out of your business. The hole you were in. What's wrong with an inmate committee? We're deadly serious about this. We feel that every item on here is warranted, and we're gonna keep up this demonstration till we get what we want. Let's get this straightened out. - Hey, Red. - Hey, Red. If they're not willing to talk us, then straighten this mess out. Then, maybe, they'll listen to us. What in the hell'd you do it for, Cully? Do what? The Indian, man, you locked him up and he's going nuts in there. He was fixing to cancel our insurance policy. So, I did it his protection and ours? This whole deal's turning sour, my man. Well now, go lock yourself up in a cell and stay the out of it. And have you guys leave me behind. I told you, there'll be trouble. We feel it's impossible to present a fair picture of the inmates point of view, while those men are behaving like that. Did you work in some other prison before you came here? No. Why? How old are you? How old am I? - Yeah. - Well, I'm 29. Where did you work before you got here? Well, I was with the state welfare board. Doing what? - Counselling. - Convicts? No, as a matter of fact I was counselling unwed mothers. Well, we don't have that problem here, so why don't you just stay out of this? Jesus, Cully, the newspaper's asking questions of my queen's row, with the mascara and the, you know. And the kangaroo court. Well, how did you handle it, Red? I told 'em that a couple of boys were getting a little wild but that we'd take care of 'em. Getting a little wild? Look, man, we gotta cut off this bar and now. I wanna talk to you. All right, you want the to do it yourself? Would you believe it if I told you that we're actually getting somewhere in these negotiations? - I'd believe one thing. - What's that? I believe you've bought yourself a snow job. And nobody can talk to you. Take a look at that clock. Just a few more hours to go till sundown. And you and me, we're gonna have a little talk with Joe Surefoot. Yeah, if we can find him. Don't worry about that, we can straighten him out. Look, baby, we're close, real close, and then we're gonna go. Get that straight, Red, and keep that straight. Cully! You're right, man, you're right. I don't know what's happening. Look, man, you had a good plan and it's still a good plan. Now, you and me and Joe, were gonna go. That's it. No other way. This is your warden. I am back. Turn that thing up as loud as she'll go without feedback, I want every last man in this place to hear me and hear me good. If you didn't hear me, I will say it again. This is the warden, I am back. I'll repeat that. I am back. I want you all to hear me you loud and clear. You have chosen to riot while I've been gone. You've taken some of my administrators and guards as hostages. In order to protect the lives of these hostages, the people in charge have not taken the action required. Well, I have news for you. Order will be restored immediately. I warn every one of you bastards, for every hostage you kill, I will kill 10 of you. For every hostage you cut up... - When did he get back? - I don't know, man, must been while we were in there negotiating. He could've only taken a few hours longer. And I'll throw 100 of you in the hole and throw away the key. Make no mistake. That son of a gun, he could start gassing this place right now. - No, no, man, we got the hostages. - Yeah, but that won't stop him, man. We need time. Time. Come here, man. Come here. Listen, man, go outside and get those clowns and see if you can set up a meeting with the old man. Right, right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Maybe you ought to go with me this time, buddy. No, I can't go, man, I've gotta push Gigolo and his crew so they'll go ahead and dig for daylight. Right. Okay. Wait a minute. What the hell good is a meeting gonna accomplish? Yeah. I'll tell 'em we were having a meeting over here. Yeah. And we'll deliver the hostages in three hours. No. Two hours. All right. What if he only gives us one hour? Well, we'll 'em it leads to the other side of the shed, man. And we can wait there until darkness. And it, at least we'll be outside the wall, right? - Right. - Okay, let's go. Warden, I've read these grievances, and I believe they're justified. If you'll only take a look at them... You! You wanna negotiate with me? You got one of my deputy wardens locked up. Fisk. You go get the key and bring 'em to the gate and then, maybe, I'll negotiate with you. They're taking too long to talk about it. Hey, Red, where do you got them locked up? Hey, Red! You gonna bring him back? There's something wrong. Where do you got them locked up, Red? - Hey, Red, right here. - Hey, hey, Red, come here. Hey, Red. Hey, hey, Doc. Hey, hey, Doc, tell us something. Hey! Hold on, just one more. Warden, we're going to comply with your wishes. Hey, Cully! Cully! Hey, Doc, come here, come here. Hey, Doc, give us a word, will you? Hey, Cully! Hey, why you don't answer? Man, you are so uncool. Listen, you got the key to the hostages? - Yeah. - Come, on, come on, come on. - Here. - I'm gonna give em one. Fisk. You to prove that the rest of 'em are alive. Well, what are you gonna get in return? More time. Man, he's playing with you. He's playing with you. What do you mean? Who is that man? - Looks like Cully Briston, sir. - Binoculars. You better believe he wouldn't think twice about gassing Fisk, or Grossman, or his own mother. Oh, man. Look, I better get over Joe Surefoot, man, and shape him up. We might have to change our plans or something. Cully Briston! Cully Briston, the warden wants to see you on the wall. - What did you tell him? - Man, I didn't say a word. I swear to God, I didn't say a word. Come on, Briston. Man, go ahead and talk to him. What the hell you got to lose? I gonna go get Fisk, go ahead, see what he wants. Cully Briston, come on. The warden wants to see you on the wall. So you're the one? The big shot. You're the one that's ramrodding this deal. That that so-called leader had to go to, to get the keys, to get permission. Mr. Big, Mr. Brain, you can go. And take these nitwits with you. Well, warden, should I stay here with the men? Murray, get out. Hey, Doc, come here. I'm right here for you. Who was that big and brown right there? Who is the big brother that we hadn't seen before? Come on, come on. I'll get even with you, you know that. Come on. Where? Mexico. Yes? Fraker just delivered Fisk to the main gate. The other hostages are still locked up, but reported okay. Where's Cully Briston? Briston and Surefoot, you know, - that Indian from isolation. - Yes. Crossed over to the auditorium. Fraker's gone in there too. Looks like they're having some kind of meeting, sir. What do you think? All right, here's how it goes, men. Two of my diggers first, to widen the hole. That's Bugsy, Kelly and me. Red, Joe and Cully bring up the rear. All right. When you hit daylight, go straight to the shed. No talking, stay flat, travel on your bellies. We'll stay there until dark, and we'll play it by ear in finding a truck, or a couple of cars, or whatever the hell we can find. You got it? All right, move out. Kenny. Bugsy. Kelly. Cully! What the hell are you doing here, Murray? Beat it, will you? Don't think you guys are going anywhere without me. Who the hell is that? - Look, Murray, forget it. - Listen, Cully. When you're outside, you're gonna need connections and a place to hide. - I got 'em. - The, the queer? Oh, for Christ sakes, what the hell does that mean now? You guys wanna get out? You wanna stay out? Then you need me. No dice. Let's go, Cully, come on. Listen, Cully, please. Please. I gotta get outta here. Look, Mary, beat it, will you? The plans have already been made, now beat it, get outta here! Okay, I don't go, nobody goes. Yeah. Right. All right, look, we have no choice. I say take him. So come on, let's go. - Oh, man. - Come on. Stinking snitch, man! - Go! Go! - Come on. Hold it! Hold it, hold it! - Come on! Come here, Red. - There is no way. Started to bury you dirty screws! Cully!
