Most beautiful celebrity gowns! Charlene Gonzales' white gown is beautiful. Off-shoulder, princess cut, and flown all the way from New York! It's so pretty! Sunshine Cruz's gown is more beautiful. It's an Eric Pineda piece. Look, it even has a gossamer veil. That's nothing compared to Ruffa's gown. It slays all your picks. The train was six meters long. Actually, we have a winner. When Lucy Torres set foot on that aisle, even if it was just a spaghetti-strap gown... it was studded with Swarovski crystals all over. I wonder when we'll get to wear such a gorgeous gown? First you need a groom, before the dress. We don't even have a boyfriend. Go Rocky! Girl, honestly... not to offend, but your brother has the monopoly of beauty in your family. Goldie, Goldie... Can you set me up with your brother? Excuse me. He's mine. Not gonna happen. He is mine. He's mine. Mine! -Mine! -Mine! Ouch! That hurts! You can have him. Rocky. What the hell! Be careful! I'm sorry. My teammate didn't catch the ball. That's okay, Rocky. Just promise me that you'll catch me when I fall. Guess what Rocky... My head's not the only thing you hit hard by that ball. What "fall" and "hit" are you talking about? You little floozies! Miss Sumiling, Miss Manalon, come to my office now! Ouch! Our teacher's very old. An old maid, too. There's nothing wrong with preparing for a life of marriage. Says the 15-year-old virgin. Hey girls! There's a wedding going on. Shall we have a look? Let's go! I came here first! The bouquet is mine! If height's the game, I'll get it. Can we do it in alphabetical order? Who are you? I wish my future wedding will be as grand. My dream is to get wed in a beautiful church. I haven't thought of anything yet. But my theme song will be "You are my Miss Universe." I want mine to have video coverage. So that I can preserve those memories. Church wedding, and theme song, and video coverage... All of that should be present at my wedding. Because honestly, ladies... I really feel I'll get married ahead of all of you. Girl, limit your dreams to the limits of your beauty. Are you really my friends? Anyway, we should be present at each other's wedding! Because we're the Bicol Ladies forever, right? Bicol Ladies forever! "Bridesmaid Babes" Ryan, do you take Emerald as your lawful wife? I do. Emerald. Do you take Ryan as your lawful husband? I love you, babe. I say I do. Does anyone object to this marriage? Yes! Me! Cut! What the hell, Em? It's the 25th take and you still forget your lines. "I love you and I will say I do..." "...to the 70 percent sale in gowns at the Bridal Fair in Canary Mall!" It's so simple. I got carried away. I'm really sorry. You did a good job. I'll give you many projects. Fine. Another take. Take this. Okay, clear set. ID! Take 26! Action! Oh hey! Hey! What the fuck? Wow! Babe. Em. Em. What? I thought you said you're okay with us experimenting. Yes, I do want to experiment. But damn, you were all over his test tube. It was crazy! I do everything for you. I give you all of your fantasies. All I ask is that you give me mine, too. Actually, Em... I have to tell you something. Are you finally going to propose? Uh, no. I wasn't going to propose. I just pulled a nerve on my leg. We're over, Em. What, 'cause you're gay? I'm not gay! If you're not gay, then what are you? I'm bi! Bi? Just leave! Shameless cheats! They didn't even wait till I was gone. Hey, girls? What's the news? What? Just a little more. Just a little more. Push some more. Make it happen! It's a girl! It's a girl. Thanks, Doc Ruby. So...how about it? Meet you later? Same time, same place? Are you out of your mind, Dave? Get your fathered hands off of me. You have a child now. I pulled it out of your wife's vagina. We need to stop this now. Why can't we talk it over? Let's talk about it. Please. Stop. Don't stop. Don't stop. Stop! Don't you want it? I don't want to be your mistress, okay? Alright then. I'll break it off with Mae. Then let's leave this place. Hide out in Europe. What do you want me to do? I know what you want me to do. That's what I want to do to you! End your progeny! You stupid beast. Hey, girl. I'm doing good. What's up? I'm happy, of course. What? Sister Perla? Mother Superior... You'll be taking your final vows soon. You will become a full-pledged nun. Have you made up your mind? Yes, Mother Superior. But before that day comes, my dear girl, I want you to go out into the world, so that you can be certain that this is truly the path you wish to take. To feel without a doubt that Papa JC dwells in your heart. Papa JC? Jesus Christ. Do you dig it? I dig it, Mother. Okay, then. I'll take my leave. I'm late for my Zumba. I meant service. Hello? Girl! You will not believe it! We need to meet soon, because I'm going to tell you I'm getting married! Really? Hi, Waze. Set destination to Tagaytay. Tagaytay. Two hours, 25 minutes away. Have a safe trip. Girl! How are you? Sorry. You're so loud. Hey, do nuns still commit sins? Of course. But I'm not a nun yet. Still a novice. Besides, I've confessed all the sins I might commit in advance. Because whenever I'm around you, I get thrown into the world of sin. I'm hurt. Some leeway, so to speak. When's your church wedding, anyway? To the most perfect groom of all? Papa Jesus... Next month. After novice, I will finally be a nun. I'm so happy for you, girl! Come on. Let's get going. Hi girl. How are you? Hello! Hi! Oh, what happened? Why do you look so haggard? It shows on your eyes, especially. Haggard? How about you, did you just get back from a shoot? Or is that your everyday makeup? This is just how I am. Girl, usually hospitals have an ambulance. What's with the funeral car? It's because majority of our patients come dead on arrival. And 90 percent die after surgery. So the owner thought of tapping into the funeral service business. Brainy, huh? So if you girls ever need a checkup, I have a big discount. We're very healthy. Sure? I'm very healthy. We need those checkups. -We should go. -Okay. -We're going to be late. -Let's go. You're so busy. I really need a break. I've been awake for 24 hours. Shagging is my only rest. Girl... what's "shagging"? Perla, "shagging"... Banging. Fucking. Sex. Bow-chick-a-wow-wow. Jeez. Perla! You're turning into such a prude! Bet you've got webs down there. Don't pick on Perla. You know she's in training to become a sister. In-training means she's not yet sworn. Which means she can still change her mind. By the way, Em, how are you and Brent? You're five years strong now, right? That's impressive. Ruby, didn't you hear? We're over. What? I didn't know. I'm not updated. Oh well, at least...you're free now in case Mr Right comes along, the love of your life he who will be the icing on your cupcake. Right? Like in the song. Oh! Speak of the devil. That happened to me. I hooked up with a foreigner last week. He brought whipped cream. Then he kneeled in front of me. So I moaned. I was like, Ohh...ahhhh... Wait a minute. Let's stop here. I need to pee. Hold up. Someone's turned on by our conversation. I'm not. I just need to pee. Please. Let's stop somewhere. I really need to go. It's coming. Typical. Water? -I have some in the car. You want some? -Mommy, it's the lady from the commercial. Hey, kid. What do you remember? A napkin a day keeps the baby away. Modes. A sanitary napkin for keps. You're so cute. Okay. Bye. Miss, two coconuts, please. What a surprise. Out of the fours of us, Goldie is getting married first. Makes you wonder. With that face? You're so mean. She has other qualities. Sure, qualities that do not include having a pretty face. We actually thought you'd get married before the rest of us. Because you're the one with A-G-E. A-G-E? Is that some disease? No. A-G-E. Age! Age. Senior. Hag. Excuse me, I'm not old. I'm not saying you're old. But you might... want to freeze your eggs just in case. I guess. Since you're the expert in taking advantage of science. With all the treatments you had done to look young, you'll start looking like a fetus. Actually, I hate invasive treatments. I only did my eyebrow tattoo. All this is real. Really now? Yes! Check out our friend who used to be a goth. Things really do change. That's true. I mean if your nose can change, so can people. What did you say? I said let's go. Girl. Goldie's taking so long. Girls! -Girl. -Wow. Oh my goodness! It's so hot here in the Philippines! Wow! Fabulous! I'm so sorry I'm late. I'm still jetlag from the airport in LA. But... look at us! I'm so happy we are finally together again because we are... -The Bicol ladies... -Forever! So happy to see you! Girl, your beauty's on a different level now. Same with you. You've really leveled up your style. Especially you, Emerald. I didn't even recognize you. Really? You look different now. Ruby, you know what... -I have to tell you something. -What? Look at those perfectly... ...perky boobies! -That's all natural. -Look at them! -I love them. -All natural, baby. Go right ahead. Okay cut it out. Hey! This is Jade Cyrus. Congratulations. You're meant for each other. No, silly. She's my bestfriend from the States. What's wrong with you? She's also a bridesmaid just like the three of you. And she also happens to be a videographer. Get ready for Bicol ladies because here we go. Open it a little girl. I can't breathe. There we go. Perla. What's taking you so long? I can't wait to swim outside. -Just a second. -There's a plenty of boys out there. Are those your house clothes? The reason you're out of the convent... ...is so you can experience the outside world, right? Come on, please. For me. There's a problem. What? One... Two... Three! A forest? How many years have you been growing this? She's silent type, right? She's just shy. Hey girls... Thank you. All of you are here with me. -Oh, what can we do? -I love it. You're only going to get married once, right? I hope. So... spill. How did you meet this lucky guy? Just my charm. So your fiance's blind? Ah, a foreigner. You met him in the States, didn't you? Or an ex-pat. 'Cause...you're just their type. -Someone who has that... -Has what? That island spice. Exotic. Endangered species. Someone from the wild. What? Huh? A wild beauty! Come on. Come clean. You're pregnant, aren't you? Did you trick him? No! Why is it so hard to believe, huh? This is pure effort. Okay. So it's true what they say. The flirt trumps the beauty. I'm both. You know it. So where is he? That's the thing. You can't meet him today. He's busy sorting out a lot of things in Manila. You know. So we'll just meet him at the wedding place. Which is in... Albay. Yay! Awesome. You're getting married in our hometown. I have not been there in so long. That's fantastic. You're all set. When's the wedding so I can save the date? -Right. -Haven't I told you? In two days. Two days? How? You underestimate me. I took care of everything. Since this is a rush wedding... the catering, the gown, the food suppliers... we'll have to check on them one by one. So the only thing left for you to do is just do your best to be my bridesmaids... ...and I'm sure my maid of honor will help me to the maximum level. I'm busy. I might not be up for it. Try Ruby. Girl, as you know, I won't have enough time. Okay? I might end up ruining it for you. To be honest, I haven't picked out my maid of honor. So far we've only decided on the best man. And you know him. Oh my god! Piolo Pascual! No. You used to have a crush on him. Oh my god! Romnick Sarmienta? No! Here's a clue. He looks like me. Girl, out of all the men you could possibly get... you had to choose Empoy? No! It's my brother, Rocky! Where's Rocky? Where is he? Rocky! How are you? -How are you doing? -I'm doing good. -What about you? How are you? -You've grown so big. You have such a big...arm. I work out. Rocky, my baby brother. You remember the Bicol ladies? Of course. Yeah, yeah. Long time no see. How are you guys? -I'm okay. -I'm fine. -But sis, can I shower first? -Go. -Alright. Come on. -Let's go together. You're coming with me? Let's shower together. "Let's shower together." Give me a break. Rocky! I volunteer as your maid of honor! Goldie, are you thirsty? Uh Goldie, here's a pillow so you're more comfortable there. Does the aircon reach you there at the back? I'm so delighted. It's such a difference being around you Bicol ladies. I feel so pampered. Why are you called Bicol ladies again? Oh, it speaks! It does. Thank you so much for that wonderful question. Apart from the obvious fact that we're from Bicol, well, we represent the native wonders of our province. I'm Bicol Express because I'm mouth-watering and I'm the hottest. And I'm Mt Mayon because they say I'm perfect. Like the perfect shape of Mt Mayon. And I'm Pili Nuts. Because in the end, they go nuts for my beauty. And I'm abaca. Because I'm the strongest of all, just like the fiber. I thank you. Wait a minute... Why is yours different? They get to be hot, perfect, while you... Oh, I don't know. I've gotten used to it. Is that bad? All right. If you are the products of Bicol, then I'm the tourist. I intend to experience each one of you. Yuck. The joke sounded better in my head. Waze. Waze alert, waze alert. Avoid using cellphones while driving. Especially while stalking your crush on Facebook. Gotcha. Waze. I can't believe you. You're such a killjoy. Stalking and driving. Impressive. I can't help it. Rocky has achieved full heartthrob potential. You keep checking out my little brother. If there's one thing you should feast your eyes on and appreciate, it's this...right here. Wow... I know! That is Saudi gold. He saved up for that and he ordered it for me online. I see. So he's a gallant spender. What's his name again? Uh, his name is Xavier. Wow. His name sounds handsome. Like a Hollywood star. I love his name. Actually, I got super attracted to his name. Online. That's his user name. Huh? What? And then he chatted me, then lots of video calls on Skype. It seemed like he fell in love with me quite easily. And I was like, "Huh? I love you too." And then, after five months, he proposed to me. I said, "Yes!", of course. That's it. Like... So now I'm so excited to see him. I just want to see him now! So that means you haven't met him in person? Of course. I was in the US and he was in the Philippines. Goldie, do you have a picture of him? Yes. It's in my phone. Wait. Never mind. It's a surprise. You might steal him away from me. Just kidding. Hey wait. Wait, pull over. -Right there. -What for? -There. -Is this one of your suppliers? No. I need to let my mother know. I need to ask for her blessing. What? But your mother's dead. I can feel something. Mamita? Is that you? Excited? Calm down, won't you? I feel something different. So intense. Cut it. I can feel incredible luck. Choose one. For a hundred pesos. Madam, that only costs 20 pesos. It's okay. I'll take it. You do realize Madam's a fake, right? Luck's just about how strongly you believe in it. I can feel this. This gold for the gold ticket, ma'am. Gold is for Goldie. Your luck is looking as good as your face. Payment. Let's hold hands. Finger against finger. -Finger against finger. -Seriously? Abakayna magpapaenggerka Say it with me. Abakayna magpapaenggerka Faster! Abakayna magpapaenggerka Say it faster! Abakayna magpapaenggerka Altogether! Abakayna magpapaenggerka All together! Abakayna magpapaenggerka Fingered! My dear girl. It's me. Mom Auring. Mamita? Is that you? Yes, my dear. It is me. Mamita, your voice sounds a little deep. The real you has a Visayan accent and somewhat high-pitched. Like this? Mamita! -Mamita! -What is it? I'm getting married. Look at that. Who would have guessed, huh? Yes, aunt. Mamita, I'm so happy but I really need your blessing, because my boyfriend is so kind. His name is Xavier. What do you think? Well, is everything okay, dear? Whatever makes you happy, isn't that what they say? Go for gold, right? Right, I'm going back to the spirit world. Mamita! She's gone. Forgive me but she's gone. That will be 5000 pesos. "Province of Quezon" "This looks suspicious, girl." "I know, right." "Too good to be true! Maybe he's not real?" "You're so mean! Stop that." "Admit it, Perla... this smells fishy. What do we do?" "I think we'll find a hired model or talent when we get there." "Or nobody at all. There's an imaginary friend, why not an imaginary fiance?" "Either way the woman's gone crazy." "Don't judge her, you guys. We can just clear it up later." Goldie! What happened? Did we almost hit something? Nothing like that. Wake up! Unbelievable. More sleep, more fun? What is this? Put in some work, why don't you? We'll drop by my designer's shop. It's a good thing you've arranged things with a designer. Yes, I emailed him. We talked it all out over email. Oh my! Good morning girls! Sorry, I just got back from another client. Hello. I am Tailor Swift. Who is the bride? Oh! It must be you. Let me look at you. -Wow! How sexy! -Hello. Give me a second. Aw, how pretty. I'm not the bride. Then it must be you! -Hello! -Will you stand up? Just wait. -Let me see. -Me? What a tiny waist! I love it. Oh, blushing! I'm not the bride either. It's not you? It can't be this one 'cause he looks like the ring bearer. -Excuse me? -Give me a sec, miss. It must be you. Stand up, dear. Let me see you. What long legs! Gorgeous. I love it. But I'm not getting married. You're not? Then who is? Hi! You? Lucky you? Somebody actually made an attempt at you. Phew. Tough life. Just a moment. Girls, I think I feel something. There you go again, Perla. Say what? Perla has a sixth sense. Sometimes she's just paranoid. Don't scare us. There are no ghosts here. Actually, girls... there is a ghost here. My old assistant who killed herself on her wedding day haunts this place. Girl, I can see her now. Me too! What does she look like? Can you describe her? Okay. She's wearing a very classic gown. Petticoated bustle with lace on the front down the hemline... ...with Swarovski crystals. Very elegant. I give it a five out of five. I agree. What a beautiful gown for a ghost. It really is. I designed it. But she's ugly. So ugly. God. Goldie is taking forever. A snake must have swallowed her whole. Be patient. Oh, I remember. While we're waiting, I'll give this a go. Jade, Madam Astra's a fraud. It's not real. Hey Perla. Luck doesn't fall on just anyone. You have to claim it and have a feel for it. Right now I have a good feeling about this. I told you! Why, what is it? Jade won 10,000 pesos! Isn't it beautiful? Must be why you're screaming! No, no. Isn't it pretty? In fairness, it's beautiful. Thank you. I finally feel it. Where did that gown come from? From my dead assistant, like I said. Don't worry, I will still alter it. Goldie, are you sure you like that gown? It might have something weird. Don't be negative! I'll wear this even if it was a leper's hand-me-down. I don't care. As long it makes me look pretty. Wait, do you really want to look pretty? Wait there. I have just the detail to add. It will really make you shine. This is it. Boom! Gorgeous, right? -Gorgeous. -There you go! You're even more beautiful with this. Voila! Looking great, right? Very mysterious, isn't it? Rocky is video calling. Please answer the call, Perla. Hi Rocky! Hi Rocky! Brother, what do you want? Nothing, sis. I'm just checking on you. We're okay. Has Xavier my love called you yet? Not yet. Okay just wait for his call. I'm sure he's just busy at work. By the way sis, the groomsmen are asking about who they'll be partnered with. So, have you chosen your maid of honor? Come in. Welcome to Bella Florist. Who is Bella? My wife. But she's passed away. You survived her? Go on. Have a look. Goldie! Look at this...classic rose. If you choose this, you will look like Rosalinda... Classic means old. That's why...Daisy suits you more. So you don't look a day over 19. Don't turn your back on tulips. Because if Xavier sees these, you'll be locking lips on lips. Don't you know? Calla lily will love you once you meet again. Wait, ladies... I love all of your suggestions. They're all great. But I have already decided. I want...carnations. I want to feel like a beauty queen on my... coronation night! Hey Emerald, Santan really suits you. 'Cause it's normal, basic, and common. Just like you. And you Ruby, Sampaguita looks best on you. For your funeral. With him. Don't fight. You can mix up all those flowers, you know. By the way, we have a promo. Aiza! Bring it here. Flower! And also... We even have a free ribbon. Here it is. "Rest in peace?" This is not a wake! This is my wedding! What's wrong, girls? I thought this would be exciting for you guys. What with all the food-tasting and all-you-can-eat cakes? Don't worry, Goldie. I brought something. Here. What's that? Just something to lighten the mood. Isn't that bad? Not at all. We do this all the time in New York. Besides, you're all so down. Hey! It's your best friend’s wedding for Christ's sake. I-K-R. Just this once. -Put some more. -Me too. Hang on. More. There we go. That's a lot. I haven't tried this yet. May I try it? Alright, let's eat. They say that's therapeutic. Of course. Wow! Heaven. Where's the exotic food for the exotic bride? -Bring on the exotic dishes! -Here it comes! As you requested Pasta Ala Bulate. -Worms. -Wow! Frog. Cicada and Centipede Spaghetti. Wow! Delicious! We want more exotic raw dishes! More exotic and raw coming up! Frog! As requested, more exotic and raw. Snakebite. That's tasty! Make it into adobo! Let's have it raw! No! It's better in sour soup! Waze, is this the right way to Manaconda Bar? Isn't it too far? You're human and I'm the one connected to Google Maps. Obviously, you are more accurate. You're a bitch, Waze. I like it. Jade, what was it that you put in our cakes earlier? It kicked in pretty strong. Ah...it was oregano. Goes great with cake, doesn't it? What? Oregano? So we're not really high? Yep. You were over-reacting! You have reached the Manacondra Bar. The Home of Arid Women. There it is. So this is the place with call boys Waze was taking us to. Hi ma'am. Come in. In fairness, Miss Waze is giving us what we want. Wait a minute. We aren't high anymore. Perhaps we should reconsider. We're already here. -Let's make the most of it. -I agree. Besides, before the Holy Spirit enters you, maybe you could let others in first. I'm kidding. Take it easy. Come on. Excuse me. What will you have? Hi mister. We want the hardest drink on your menu. -Okay. -Okay. -Excuse me ma'am. Your order. -Perfect. Ladies and lady boys, please welcome... The Manacondas. Perla, see anyone you like? Go on. -Him? -That one? Here he comes... Perla, go ahead. Go. Oh. Here comes... You look a lot like Brent. He says he's Brent. Go. Wait up. Wait, what about me? What is this? I'm the bride! I can't believe you guys. Lucky I get to dance with a pretty one. Are you sure? There are lots of other girls here... But you are the best. ♪ Round and round we go Cheers! -These are our VIP rooms. -This is it? -Yes. -Fine, fine. I'll wait outside then we can go to that place I told you about. Thanks. Emerald? Perla? Brent, you beast! You shameless scum! You shameless scum! You shameless scum! Five years. Five years, damn you. I gave you everything. My body, your motorcycle, your rubber shoes, even your laptop. I gave you everything. Even his laptop? Why do I deserve this? I loved you like a gay man. You're an asshole, Brent. -Where is Perla? -I gave you everything. I don't know. What? Where is Perla? Perla? What's that? Girl, never mind. At least one of us hit the jackpot. Learn from yesterday, live for today, and hope for tomorrow. Repent from all your sins. Start a new life. Hey. Perla! What the fuck? Stop with your spiritual retreat. We have somewhere else to be. Correct! Change your ways! Change all of it! All of you shameless scum. Let's get moving! Okay. God bless. Yes, ma'am. Wow! Goldie's really into it. Goldie! She's having so much fun. Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Indulge us. Take it off! Your friend's knocked out. What do you think, Aunt? Do they pass? Close your eyes, baby. This isn't for children's eyes. Yes, you. They will love you long time. What are you waiting for? Dance for us. Hold up, we're your clients and you want us to dance for you? Right! And what do you mean "us"? Did you invite more people? Do you expect us to shell out additional payment? That's not going to... Could just be a fetish? Looks like the real thing! Go on and do it. Dance. He said dance. Geez. All of you dance. So, Aunt. Who do you like best? Oh, dear boy. None of them will please Mr Tanaka in Japan. Let's just go to the arcade. Vicky, go to sleep. Past your bedtime. -This one's sick in the head. -Yeah. So, do you like what you see? Yes. Yes. Especially that fat one. He said you're fat. Me? I'm not fat. Jade is fat! I'm not! You are! Dance! Be quiet Dance! Hurry! Let's go. Quickly! Oh no! My legs! My bread and butter! Which would you prefer, a scratch or a stab? Darling girls! Where do you think you're going? Come back here this instant! My dear sisters, I still want to play with you! I'll give you a green card. Hey! Get back here! I'll kill you. Come on! Help me out! Quick! Stop it right there! -Hurry up! -Stop it! Open the door! Open it! Get out of the car. Get out! Open the door! Get out! Hurry up! They're on to us! Let's run him over! Hurry up! Let's stop here! Shit! What happened? Is the call boy alive? Well, Perla. Why don't we go back and check if he's okay? I'm just saying good or bad, he may be a call boy, it's still wrong to shoot a person. What happened? The best party ever! Did you see the face of the gunman? We saw him, okay? And he saw us see him kill somebody. I don't get it. You don't get it? I said, we saw him, and he saw us see him kill that guy. I might figure it out later. -Oh my god! There's a cop! -I get it now. There's a cop! Why is he following us? What's the plan? -This is it. We should tell him. -Don't. Don't. -We need to tell him! -We can't. Let's keep it among ourselves, okay? It's our secret. -Let's tell him. -Let's not. Ma'am, good evening. Good evening, sir. Can you step out of the vehicle? -Get out of the car! -Get out. He said get out. Don't you know you're guilty of a crime? Chief, that wasn't us. Swear! It was you. I saw with my own two eyes... ...the horrific crime you committed. Have you no fear of God? We're sorry, Chief. We don't want to go to jail. You women really get on my nerves. I can't wrap my head around the sins you're capable of. So gruesome. Sir, we didn't kill anyone. -Promise, it wasn't us. -Hey. What? What's wrong? Kill what? Kill? The crime you were saying. Oh, that. I meant you were overspeeding. Overspeeding? We were just overspeeding... Hey! Just overspeeding? Don't take overspeeding lightly. -Sorry sir. -You should be. What happened to your friend in there? Ah, you see... She fainted. That's why we were going so fast. We needed to bring her there. -To the hospital. -Well go on then! Hurry! Go! Overspeed. Drive safely. Take care all of you. -Take care. Text me. -Quickly! Right. Go! Bye! -Your dog's so cute. -Oh, thank you miss. Her name's Beyonce? -Yes, Beyonce. -So cute. We always fall for that. Good looking men with... I'm developing trust issues. Let's go. Come on. Perla, get us rooms. -Hurry up. -Yes I got it. Do you have rooms available? What kind of room would you like? What's up? Check this out. What do we do now? Let's report this to the police now. We have evidence. Are you crazy? We can't. It's too risky. They might follow us. I say we stay here. Nobody say anything. We keep it among us. You know what, Let's figure this out tomorrow. When we've sobered up, okay? Stoned! You're stoned! -Hand me my wallet. -Enough of that. Wallet. Where's my wallet? Come on. The room's ready. Girl, I'm still shaken. What if the guy hunts us down? There's still a lot of things I want to do. It's unlikely. We're safe here. Girl, I'm not yet famous, but I'm a super pretty prince in commercials. I'm going to be a maid of honor and Rocky will be mine. I still have many things I want to do. Girl, we should just pray. Okay. Game. Hey. Still up? I'm not so sure this whole trip to Bicol is worth it anymore. He might catch on our trail. What about Goldie's wedding? Look me straight in the eye and tell me you don't doubt this one bit. That Zack Xavier's even real. For all you know, it's just her illusion. If only I've not been planning to steal Rocky. Why can't you just let Emerald have him? You have plenty of men to spare. Wow. You make me sound like a real tart. I don't really want to be maid of honor. And I'm not even sure I'm into Rocky that much. Then what's the issue? I don't want to lose to Emerald, okay? I know it's childish but... I can't let it happen. Girl... I've got to tell you something. Girl... Shit! Ruby! The wound's bigger than I thought. Can you check it out? Come in. God... it's huge. Look at it. Damnit. Will this last 'till next week? I've got tons of modeling events. I cannot be flawless. I have a car show next week! What do I do? Have it checked by a dermatologist when we get back. With all your surgery, I'm sure you have a regular doctor. Why don't you try getting your wrinkles erased? There you go. Ouch! That hurts! Stop it! That's what you get. Ouch! Enough. Hey! What happened? What is it? He got in! Who? The killer? No! That thief! He got in. How did you get here? This dog? Yes! I might have left the door open. I went down to the reception. You're so dramatic, Goldie. It's just a puppy. Good girl Beyonce. Look at my finger! Did it bite you? Where? When I woke up... I saw it licking my engagement ring right here. Just when I was about to grab it... she swallowed it! She swallowed my engagement ring! It was one karat! Saudi gold. We're not leaving until that dog gives me back my engagement ring. By the way, what happened last night? Girl, I was so wasted. I can't remember a thing. Super knockout. Imagine, the call boy was right in front of me but nadah. Zilch. Damn. I hope you got his number so the next bride can book him again, 'cause he was such a good dancer. He was like... Awkward! Girl, your Waze is too self-aware. It's in beta testing. Warning, danger ahead. There's a huge pothole. Why didn't you warn us earlier? Sorry. Am I not allowed restroom breaks? No! We've got a flat tire. What? Who can fix it? I'll do it. Geez. They buy a car but don't know how to change a tire. Do they plan to just flash their legs at a handyman... ...and he'll change their tires? So typical. Girl, you do know Jade's gay, right? Nope. Look at her. She told me she's just finding herself. Finding herself? More like finding the clasp of your bra while you were spooning last night. She told me. Aren't you full of ideas? I'm sorry. But Goldie, I feel like she has a crush... Girls. Car's good to go. You can go in now. -Fantastic! -Yes! Thank you! Wait for me. I just need to pee. Go ahead. Okay. Alright. Good job. Isn't she boyish? Just boyish? Standing up? I do that. Sometimes. Waze, where are you taking us? What's that? It stinks! Oh! What's that smell? -What is it? -Beyonce, can you smell it? Such pretty faces, but your fart stinks! Come on, it's just us. Own up. -Hey. -Hello. Seriously? You're not going to admit it? Right. Fine, to stop the fighting, I'll take the blame. I'll take one for the team. If you don't want to own up, I'll cover you. To set things straight, it really was you. Analyzing suspect. Goldie. Confirmed. Good thing I'm wearing a T-back. Just a sec. I'll check on Goldie. Okay. Here she comes. Where are you going? What's this about? This? This is an intervention. Yes! Admit that you're in love with our friend! Spill! Fine. I'm in love with Goldie. Happy now? Girls, do you have wet wipes? No we don't, sorry. What a champ. I need a corn leaf. It stings. Thank you. Beyonce? Eat a lot so you'll poop out my ring faster, okay? Please. Okay, girls. The Bicol ladies are back on their province of origin. Why are you called Bicol ladies, ma'am? That's because... Because she's Bicol express. Like a sidewalk eatery, -she's open to anyone who wants to eat. -Hey! And she's Mt Mayon, like the volcano thought to be quiet but inwardly naughty. Ruby's like the pili nuts because she's old... ...and her skin's tough and wrinkly. Goldie, like the abaca fiber... has still a long way to go. You made no reservations. You really gave judgment on all of us. Well, coming from the tourist who wants to get a taste of us. Zack Xavier texted. He says he's ready to meet with us. At Cagsawa Ruins. Really? With all our stopovers, he really took his time. At least we will finally meet the mystery guy. But wait, why are you rushing to get married anyway? Before he changes his mind, I'll chain up the prize. But girl, you haven't even met him. Why, have you met the Lord? Why do you want to be a nun? Because of faith, isn't it? I know your answer because I have the same thing. Faith also. Am I right? Okay... So? May I eat now? Yes. Yeah. Go ahead. I found the calamansi! No wonder the noodles were bland. Let's take a selfie! -Game. -Selfie! There we go, looks nice. Hold on. I just have to look for Zack Xavier. I can smell him. He's already here. Okay. I'll buy souvenirs in the mean time. I'll go with you. Miss, I'd like to buy mangoes. -How much? -50 pesos ma'am. Lucky. I've got just the change. Here you go. Thank you miss. Thank you ma'am. Pinder? Looking for an instant rebound? Leave me alone. Hey. I know all about that. You can't hide anything from me. Same with you. You're busted. I know your secret. What are you talking about? That mango. You're eating mangoes. I know why. I helped look for your keys in your bag. Come on, help me out! It makes sense. You're showing symptoms. Suzy, meet Gerald. What is that smell? Shit! Don't worry. I won't tell them your secret. As long as you promise to keep mine. Touch down Bicol. It's so beautiful! Miss! -Oh, hi! -Aren't you the sanitary napkin endorser? -Yes. So great. -Can we take a picture? Sure. -Thanks! Bye! -Thank you miss. Goodbye. Em. Oh my god, Rocky! You're here. These are my friends. They'll be the groomsmen at the wedding. Hi. Rocky! Where's Zack Xavier? He isn't here yet. He texted me last night. He said he got stuck in Manila. But he's probably close by now. Suppose he's a runaway groom by now. That's not true. I'll give him a call while you chat some more. You're a big shot now. Hey! Em, I have something to tell you. -What is it? -Focus! -Oh my god! -Why what's wrong? Rocky! Guys, please excuse us. Em needs to go to the toilet. Yeah. I can't hold it any longer. I'm so sorry. -Come on. -Alright. -Goldie, let's go. -Zack Xavier is not answering. Do you want Zack Xavier to see you looking so haggard? No! I notice you guys have been so tense. Tell me the truth. Why are you so scared? You see... I got it. You don't have to explain. Ever since we arrived in Albay, I noticed that it's finally sinking in that I am really getting married. That is so sweet of you. I am so touched. But I really don't like you all tense like this. Remember our favorite pick-me-up song back in high school? In three...two...one... ♪ Just this morning ♪ You held me captive ♪ By your fetching eyes ♪ Oh, how quick does your love run dry ♪ Faster than the blink of an eye ♪ For a moment I thought I had it, ♪ Now it's gone ♪ Faster than the blink of an eye Let's go down. Come on. Is this skin-whitening product you're endorsing any good? "Gluta whitening." How many of this did you swallow to look like that? It really does wonders to your skin. They also have an anti-aging variant. That might suit you better. Girls, I do miss your lively banters, but today, I'm just happy that we're all here finally. Together and complete for my wedding day. You know, it's such a perfect day. Yep, we're all set. We're just missing the groom! What I mean is, we haven't seen the groom yet. Yes, that's true. We haven't seen your groom in Tagaytay. Not at the market either. Shouldn't he be here at the hotel by now? Oh! What do you know, he's calling me now. Yeah, look. I don't hear any ringing. See, it's vibrating. That's what happens on silent mode. You know, silent mode. I will answer the call now. Hello? Hi, love. How are you? No, it's okay. We're fine. Yeah, see you later okay? I love you. Bye. That's more like it. He's caught in a lot of traffic, you know? He's a busy man. So, I know what I'm gonna do. I should take a shower. Shower in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Traffic? There's no heavy traffic on the way here. Girl, I'm getting really suspicious about this. First of all, he hasn't come to meet us. Then, they have not met each other in person. She can't even show us a picture of him! Oh! Girl, there's her phone. Grab it. Can you not snoop around other people's phones? Would you like to volunteer your phone? I'll confirm some things. Here goes. I know you know her password. Give it up. What do you say? Password. See. She knows. Look at this! She wasn't talking to anyone! -Let me see. -What? Check out the call log. There's nothing there. God, things are looking really dicey. Well, at least one of us is happy. Go sis! We love you! Go sis! Girls... I think I feel something. What is up to you? God, stop it with your "I see dead people" stunt. I don't want to hear about no ghosts. Ignore them and they will ignore you. I can't believe you! Don't be so touchy! You know what, I let you borrow so many swimsuits. You almost never get to use them. Hold on. I'm cold. I'll just run to the rest room. Next time wear a jacket when you swim so you don't get cold. Alright, Golds... Since your wedding's tomorrow, you must be done choosing a maid of honor. Perfect 'cause Em told me that whoever you choose, there'll be no hard feelings between us. Actually, I'm a little concerned about Ruby... your photos might not look that flattering... ...because of her saggy eye bags and saggy boobs. In fairness Em, you have small boobs but they're perky. They're as sharp as your nose. Which was stubby back in high school. Ladies, ladies, I don't want you to fight anymore. I choose everybody to be my maids of honor. Okay but who's going to be partnered with Rocky? So that's the reason... Now I know why both of you are like that to me. We're sorry. But for real, who's it going to be? I don't know why you want to be partnered with my brother so badly. When Perla's the one who's been keeping quiet about it. What does Perla have to do with this conversation? Well, they had a past, remember? What? Don't you know? We don't know anything. Why didn't we know about it? Ma'am, you have so many muscle knots on your back. Yes, I do have a lot of muscle knots. It's the same in my heart. I had it reserved for someone for many years for nothing. Ma'am, are you okay with the pressure or shall we take it up a notch harder? Go harder. I'm sure it won't hurt worse than a friend's betrayal. Who betrayed you? Don't play dumb. Who else but you! Wolf in sheep's clothing. I'm sorry Perla. I accidentally spilled it. Em, Ruby. Sorry I didn't have the courage to tell you back then. But that was a long time ago. Rocky and I are over. That's right. Besides, you know it's nice if we just set all our issues behind, because I've decided who is going to be my maid of honor. And it's Jade. Wait, why me? Jade... because you're the only one who isn't crushing on my brother. You've been a good good friend to me since day one. Good friend? Is that all you will ever think of me? Goldie, I've had feelings for you for so long. In fact, that's the only reason I'm going to your wedding. To scream out my objection. That has always been my goal since day one. Then you pick me? I'm sorry. Sorry Goldie but I can't be your maid of honor. I'm sorry, Jade. That's okay. There's no point now. Because I know there won't be a wedding to object to. I forgot, you don't have a groom. I do have a groom! What is wrong with you? Why do you keep doubting me? Goldie, would you please... Give it a rest. I fiddled with your phone... And you weren't talking to anybody. Fine! I pretended I was speaking to him. Because you were pressuring me! I was worried you'd think my fiance wasn't putting effort into our wedding. I understand he must have a good reason why he's not here with me right now. Okay? And he's real. Goldie, can you please stop? Everybody knows the truth. Let's stop with all the lies. Look who's talking. Aren't you the one with the big fat secret? Mommy? I didn't tell anyone! So what if I'm pregnant? So what if it has no father? Then I'll be a single mom. I don't mind. At least I'm not the one with a fictional husband. I keep telling you Zack Xavier is not fictional! Stop talking about Zack Xavier! Even the name sounds weird to me! You mean to say... you're all in agreement? You all think I just made this all up? You are my bridesmaids! My best friends! You must have such perfect lives. Because of you, I managed to complete all the requirements of being a true bride. Something old. Because you're old news. Something new. Because from head to toe, you're surgically touched up. Something borrowed. Because you love hooking up... ...with your friend's crushes. And something blue. Because you're the saddest lesbian I've ever met in my life. You lousy, useless friends! Eat that! Oh my god... That's bad for the baby. All of us dreamt of getting married. But you know, life happens. We forgot all about it. Until... somebody made us remember. You mean Goldie? It was my fault. I thought I could escape getting old. I kept searching for forever, and the years caught up with me. That's why Em kept teasing you about looking haggard. It's an old belief that when a woman looks haggard, she's carrying a boy. That just might be the man who will love you forever. Well... And if it makes you feel better... When you become a mom, I'm sure you'll be a MILF. You think so? It's your turn? Girls, can I talk to you? I'm mad at you, Perla. I'm sorry girls. Things happened too fast between us back then. Silly girl. If you were the one he liked, well, it can't be helped. It would have been nice to know, because I'd have been totally okay with it. Em? Perla, of course we'd get pissed off. Like earlier. But now that we've thought things through, we remembered that nothing is stronger than our sisterhood. Such a waste, though. It would have been fun to gossip about whether... ...he was a good kisser or which station of Mt Perla he's managed to climb. Hey! That's my little brother you're talking about. Gross. Hey girls, sorry about the things I said earlier. You know me. Sometimes, I blurt things out for no reason. I think we've forgiven you for making us all the way here... ...for your pretend wedding. Wait, what? What do you mean "pretend"? I thought I cleared things up. Zack Xavier is real. As a matter of fact, he's actually here right now. Love? Ladies, it's so nice to finally meet you. For the first time. Just like that. That was my exact same reaction when I first met him. I was so shaken. Handsome. Forgive me, baby. I just got here but I won't leave your side now. I love you. I love you too. Everyone, I would like to make a toast for my sister Goldie and Xavier's happiness. Not everyone is as lucky as you guys. But I'm really happy that the two of you found each other. So cheers! Baby brother, come here. You're so sweet. What about my friends, huh? What about you guys? Don't you have a speech for me? I'm happy for the both of you. I hope there will be no secrets. I hope the love in your hearts never dies. And may you remain God-fearing. Especially you, Zack Xavier! Kidding! Take care of my girl, okay? Yeah. -Girl... -Hear, hear! Golds, I prepared a rough edit of our videos from the road trip. You did some editing done? That was quick. Would you like to watch it? Of course I'm excited to see it! Everyone clap your hands! Everybody! So excited for this. Stop the car and nobody gets hurt. Get out of the car. Jade, what is this? What are you trying to do? Goldie, this is not the first time we've seen Zack Xavier. While you were bat shit drunk, Zack was busy shooting a call boy. Hold on. I can explain. Come here. Wait, you guys are making a big mistake. Rocky! What is happening? Goldie! Sis! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Don't take another step. Goldie, we know you're not getting any of this right now. You ruined my wedding. What kind of friends are you? Goldie, you just can't process things right now but we can explain. I will never understand whatever explanation you'll cook up. All I know is, you're all crazy. Fools! Maybe you were thinking... it's impossible for someone like Zack Xavier to love someone like me. And now that I've proven that he does exist... that he's real, you can't accept it and you won't let me be happy. Why? I don't understand! Since we were in high school, everything was about you. Even on this road trip. All your issues float to the surface. But for once, it's about me. -Goldie... -No! I know what you're going to say. I'm not as beautiful as you. I've accepted that. I was going to make up for it by being happy. But why won't you let me have even that? Why don't you want me to be happy? Jade. I know you wanted to stop our wedding. I get it. But the rest of you? You must be desperately lonely to want to do this to me. I can't think of another reason. That must be it. You're so sad! -Goldie! -Whatever! Don't follow me. I'm too tired for another monologue. Stay there. Rocky and the guys are keeping an eye on Zack Xavier in the stock room. It's safer there. Girls! It's Zack! I'm done! Hurry! Ouch! My knees just had to land square on the floor. It hurts! Hurry! Quickly! Damn you Zack Xavier! You can't kill her first. That's discrimination against gays. That's right. What have you done to Rocky? Did you kill him? Hold on. I need to do this or else you won't listen to me. I have explained everything to them. They went looking for a security guard. Okay, to answer your questions... I didn't kill him. If I wanted to kill Rocky, he would be dead by now. And I have no intention of killing anybody. Then what do you call what you did to the call boy, hm? Just for fun? I want to clear things up about that. I didn't kill that call boy. I'm a cop. I was on my way here to Albay... ...when I received intelligence from headquarters. There was a sighting of Boy Giling, a notorious assault robber we've been trying to locate. That man is dangerous. Victimizing women is his Modus Operandi. Why didn't you tell Rocky and Goldie about that? You've been texting each other, right? Yes but I couldn't. It's confidential. Anyway, I followed up on the report until I found Boy Giling's hideout. So I went there. Just in time, I caught him rushing towards a group of girls. That was you. I shot him, but the bullet missed him and he managed to get away. I gave chase but nothing... He knows the area better than I do. Oh... Sorry Zack. We jumped on conclusions. Wait, where's Goldie? -Goldie? -Goldie! Look at that Chief. You're marrying this woman? Tough gut you got there. Xavier, help me, please. Boy Giling, let go of my wife. I won't harm you. Aunt, are we going to let her go? Jesus. Don't, my dear. Mr Tanaka's been contacting me for the next shipment of entertainers. They're the only ones who qualify. Hey bro, don't kill off my idol 'cause she's pretty like me. Bro, leave the chubby girl, okay? Hold on. Tell us which of us you're referring to! Shut up! Put your hands up! Then smile. Then dance. Are you serious? -Dance! -Just dance, Dance. Okay. I will shoot the worst dancer. Dude, I don't know how to dance. We're dancing now. You're not counted. Come here. I'm scared away. Chief, the 70s called. They want their dance steps back. You're so lame, man. I'll shoot you first. Don't! -Yes, don't. -Right! -You get shot. -Yes, shoot her instead. Why me? No! It should be all of us! That's right! We are not going to let our friend's only happiness get killed. Yes! It's our duty as bridesmaids. Damn it. How many TV dramas did it take for you to end up in this scenario? Girls. Don't do that again. That's the last time. That was awful. -Try something different! -Okay. Sorry, sorry... But the best actor is... Actor? There's one guy over here. So the best actor is... you. Oh, it's him. Golds... Girls. I just heard back from the precinct. They're taking Boy Giling to Bilibid prison. Thank God. How is Xavier? He's stable. Thank you. Girls, thank you so much to all of you. If not for you guys, I don't know how I would've survived. That's why while I was in the States, I bought you some gifts. -Thank you. -This is for you. Pili Nut. -The chosen one. -Okay. -The hot one. -Chilis. And Miss Perfection. Thank you. BFF, are you feeling awkward? Don't be because I also have a gift for you. This is because you're the one and only tourist... ...that got to experience being with the Bicol ladies. Goldie, why aren't you dressed yet? What about Xavier? Because the bullet just grazed him, he's all patched up. So he's allowed to attend the wedding. As for the honeymoon, -you take charge of that. -It's pushing through. Thank you. Oh, wait. I just ordered something. Ah, finally. Thank you, mister. Leave it there. Ladies, don't judge me. I'm just a bit jittery so I ordered something to drink. Beyonce has pooped! Where is it? One karat! Can I have this dance? Okay. By the way, starting next month, I'll be based in Manila. Maybe you want to reconnect? Just between us two... You can check my schedule with my manager. Okay. You keep browsing through Pinder. We're the only ones here. I'm looking for someone. Who? In this group, who's using Pinder? I'm not in there anymore. I don't want to be. From now on, I'm only interested in people I know personally. You're just leading me on. Weren't you the one who told me I don't need another man in my life. Because I already have. Besides, everything is possible these days. Nenita, give it your best shot! Are you ready? Ready! Ready, girls? Ready! Thank you. Thanks. It's your turn. Ladies, are you ready for a group hug? Congrats! Who are you marrying? Papa Jesus! Alright. Alright. Smile! One. Two.
