"My ring is..." Its height is not right. You got it wrong. You need to add more soil here to fix it. This is always a problem. You didn't dig it right. It wouldn't have been a problem if you had. The water would have passed easily then. Well done, Bagga. That's how it is done. Your education is of no help to us, Pinta. You are all talk. You'll never be a good farmer. You'll always have to seek Bagga for guidance. Who wants to be a farmer anyway? I want to take up a job. I'll become an officer and live in a bungalow in the city. And I'll rent my share of land to Bagga. I wouldn't have to worry about any rain, storm and thunderstorm. It's his harvest that will get spoilt. I'll get my rent nevertheless. If he is unable to pay the rent, I'll ask him to transfer a few acres of his land to me. Then his land too will belong to me. Then I'll take pity on him because he's my elder brother, and ask him to work on my fields. You can keep praising him then. And he will enjoy them, right Bagga? It's a tradition from the times of kings and emperors... The eldest son has always been the heir. Come kids, this is our farm. We used to come here every day, to play as kids. Hey! Stupid kid! He has no manners. Bagga, teach him some sense! Idiots! Don't touch them. Come, kids, I'll show you our farm. Come with me. Alexander was unstoppable. The one to teach him a lesson was Porus. Porus's son's name was Malayketu. And his wife's name was... What was it? His wife's name was Lachi. Nice name. Here, Father, more flatbreads for you. There is no shank in the gravy. Father, I had kept it aside. I thought it's inedible. That's the best part of the dish. It is good for health. Women know nothing. Yes, Father. Grandpa, our family has a reputation in this village. - We lack nothing. - Right. We are considered one of the reputed families here, Father. He too was thick-skulled. He wouldn't listen to anyone. Uncle is the only black sheep in our family. People make fun of us behind our backs. They say Hakam Singh couldn't get his eldest son married. I had begged this one to get married. But he insisted he wanted to become a doctor. And what did he become, an animal doctor. He if was a girl, I would've married him off and got rid of him. He keeps touching animals inappropriately. I earn a good living, Father. If this is the case then I'll live separately, if it hurts your reputation so much. I'll slap you. Talking nonsense! I know what kind of money you make. Sit down and have your meal, or I'll take the plate away. - Wash my hands. - He'll take away my plate. - Grandpa... - Huh? I don't want my big brother to be like uncle. One black spot is considered good to protect from evil's eye. Two black spots will be too much to handle. Let's get him married. Alexander used to drink a lot of alcohol, just like our grandpa. They say his liver failed and so he died. Some say it was due to a fever. While others say, he had malaria. Father, my professor said I am the first girl in our village to graduate in Arts in the first division. - Hmm. - I want to get a master's degree next. I was thinking about which subjects to choose. I'll prepare for the entrance exam for some jobs too. I am sure I'll get one. Mother, I don't think she'll crack any job interview. But she might elope home anytime soon. She is always looking for excuses to stay out of the house. Let's not even talk about her getting a job. She is educated so she knows that the moon, the earth and the sun are all round. Yet her flatbreads are never round. Father, heed my advice and make her learn how to cook and get her married. Nikko might be younger than you, but she is smart. I think we have educated you enough. Now prepare to get married. Hmm? - Father, I... - Go and get more flatbread. Do you know how wrong this is? How do you even think of such things? Why are you gaslighting my life? Gaslighting your life? Really? I know where's the fire coming from! I see how you put on makeup and leave every day! I would never get first division if I had other things in my mind. Why didn't you study? No one ever stopped you. You couldn't even clear the fourth grade. I didn't need excuses to stay outside the house. So, I didn't study. So what? Anyways, you can never compete with me You cannot even make tomato chutney. Whereas I am a pro at Mash Mellon's chutney. You can always challenge me! I don't want to compete with you. And I don't want to make chutneys. Oh God, if I am right, I should have been able to keep girls like her my servant, to make chutneys for me. You can cry all you want. I am sure you are missing your boyfriend. I have no problem with you studying. I have a problem with you running away with your boyfriend. Then I won't get a good match for me. You know our family. They will get me married to a widower with kids. I'll have to take care of the kids right after marriage, all thanks to you. Grand Mother is waiting for her flatbreads. All she knows is how to make a fuss. She is just standing here. She is sure to cause trouble in the future. Father, believe me, you will soon find love letters in her name. Resham, start looking for a match. Hmm. Have some water. Give it here. - Here you go. - Keep it here. Yes, yes, yes. Minder, call the boy. - Bagga? - Yes, father? - Get Pinta. - Okay. My family is full of fools. I want to progress. I will get married to an educated girl. Send pinta with a bowl, there cups are useless. Yes, yes, Grandpa! I'm sending him. They will get me married to an uneducated girl. My family is full of idiots. I asked you to send him. Grandpa, Pinta ran away. Call the boy. Well... The boy has been at your service all this while. He is right in front of you. You didn't notice him? He is our boy. We like to stay grounded. We won't lie to you. We are a reputed family. Grandpa! Brother, you should gift him 100 rupees and perform the rituals. Okay. That's much better. There you go! Congratulations! Congratulations! We are family now. 'Bagga fell for his own trap.' 'Like any other wedding, ' 'girls and women in the village were excited about Bagga's wedding.' 'They got dressed to the T, ' 'these crazy women.' Mummy, apply some to me as well. That's enough, girl. Mummy, why didn't grandmas apply lipstick? Of course, why won't you transform us into Dimple Kapadia? There is no shortage of idiots in my family. None of them have any basic sense! They got me a white outfit. I am not going there to attend a funeral. Oh no, why did you open it? I had just ironed it. Nice, isn't it? My son will look handsome in it. Couldn't you make a pant and a shirt for me? Get me a tie only after I die. It will be easier for you to wail. You call pull the tie and cry, "Oh no! I'm going to die with you! Get up!" "Oh no." Darling, I am going to a wedding. When you don't have any sense, you should seek the advice of the one who has some. "What would you like to wear in the morning?" "I'll stitch it for you." Why are you making a face now? But we were supposed to go and dance. What should I do then? Like you'll displease God if you don't go dancing. I need to attend a wedding. You'll get many opportunities to dance. You'll dance when we'll leave for the wedding. You'll dance when we'll bring the bride home. You'll dance after we leave. You'll dance when the bride changes her dress. You'll dance at night. You dance like... You know so many songs by heart. If you had paid that much attending on your studies, you'd become judges at the court. Fine, I'll wear old pants and a shirt. You go and dance. You shouldn't miss it. Punjab won't progress if you don't dance. Go and dance. She is making me lose my mind. Mummy, why don't you two get together and stitch me a new pair. Mother, you go and dance. No son, I'll help them fix buttons or something. You never care for your son. You women always stand together for each other. You always have to degrade us. Her sons didn't keep her. I gave her refuge and I am still considered a villain. No problem. I am bad. I am cruel. You are na√Øve, innocent birds. They are making me lose my mind. Come with me, son. Let's go watch the dance. 'Every house made preparations for the wedding procession.' 'Every woman did her best.' 'They did more for their husband than for themselves.' 'Every woman made sure her husband looks on point at the wedding procession.' Where do you think you are going? It's my real brother's wedding, Father. I'll dance to my heart's content. Everyone should know that it's Hakam Singh's grandson's wedding. Really? So, now you remember Hakam Singh's house, huh? What about when you ran away from there? Do one thing, keep studying. Pack your bags and move to the room on your uncle's terrace. Why? We'll soon have our new daughter-in-law staying with us. It won't be right for you to loiter at home. And if I see you again at this wedding... Let me tell you that there are a lot of nails in my sandals. So you should know what would happen to you. Get out of here! Let's go! Everyone boarded? Did we leave anyone behind? Bhola, is your uncle here? He is always late. He always comes running, still tying his turban. Girls! What are you doing here? You couldn't stop them? We cannot take girls with us. Who asked you to come here? Get down before I hit you. Go! They want to embarrass us. Don't you ever do this again! Go! Look at her crying now! You women are smart enough. Why didn't you stop them? Standing here and doing nothing. It's okay, dear. Don't cry. It's okay.

Like they haven't eaten anything since ages! They didn't spare a single one! - They ate all of them! - Quiet. I hope they get a stomachache. Quiet, girl. What girl? I am 20 years old! I have never tasted Gulab Jamuns. Sister, give me some Gulab Jamuns too. Come here! It's your fault! - Stop! - Bloody hogger! - Get lost! - Go away. Keep quiet. Why should I keep quiet? Enjoy the fritters! Hey... Now I'll read the farewell letter. The farewell letter. I have a few tips, listen carefully. Don't ignore what I have said. You are a plant we have been nurturing, and now your gardener is taking you away. We have protected you with our life. Now they will be your family. Now your husband will be your king. Now your happiness lies with him. Now you will rule with him. We tried but couldn't fulfil their hunger, now you deal with them, sister. You can have ten children, but make sure they are not like them, sister. What is she saying? Thank you. What are you saying, huh? "We will always keep smiling!" "We will always keep drinking!" "We will set speakers on the terrace!" "We will rock the dance floor!" "We will eat, drink and make merry!" "We will enjoy our lives before we die!" "We will enjoy our lives before we die!" "We will enjoy our lives before we die!" 'In the year 1872...' 'He protested against racial discrimination, which...' Keep it down! I cannot study. Go inside and study. It's hot inside. Should I come and fan you? Remember, I'll make you collect cow dung, if you don't get a job. Look at the great surgeon standing next to you. You are jealous of Bagga. They say the girl is an Arts graduate. She looks good as well. I think you made the wrong choice. She would have been your wife. Now you are jealous because she is Bagga's wife. What are you saying, Uncle? I don't care if I don't get married, I just want to progress. He says I am jealous. I think I should have traded some progress In exchange for getting married. Let's watch a film. Look at her! We don't we get to attend weddings. Look at Madhuri, - she's dancing with the guests. - Right! Do you think you can compare yourself to Madhuri? Next, you will say, you want to wear a skirt and dance like her. Don't joke. I was just saying it. 'She is right.' 'Why don't we attend the weddings?' 'Getting a job would have only helped me' 'If I can get women to attend weddings, ' 'then I will be helping so many women fulfil their dreams.' 'Thank you, Madhuri.' Make sure they are round, okay? Dear, take God's name before you begin. It will help our family prosper. Stay back. The stove is quite hot. Come on, it's not like she is making a bomb. She is making sweet bread. I am sure she has made them many times back home. Let her make them as per her knowledge. Right. Aunty, what was that you were saying yesterday? You complained that men don't take us to the wedding. I said it because of what I saw in the movie. No, you are right. Won't it be great if they took us along? How will taking us along hurt them? We'll also get to enjoy whatever is served there. - Yes. - Hmm. We will get to wear new dresses and dance at the wedding. Right? Tell me the truth, don't you wish to attend weddings? Greetings! Greetings! She is the groom's grandmother. - Greetings! - Greetings! Guddi, get these in a bone china dinner plate. Go. What is this? I am the groom's aunt. I didn't come here to eat lentils. Oh no, she wants meat. What do you want? Drumsticks or nuggets? - Get me anything you please. - Okay. Please forgive us. I don't eat lentils, Sister. No Sister, we'll get you whatever you want. Father said the neck piece is missing. Oh no, I had kept it aside. The chickens keep playing with stones. I thought there might be a stone stuck in it. It would give him kidney stones. Listen, if we attend weddings, I too will get to eat meat. Why not go to the moon instead? What will women do at weddings? Listen to her! You are crazy! Who teaches you such stupid things?! Why do you want to attend a wedding, huh? What will I do if a drunkard kidnaps you? Tell me, what will you do there, huh? Tell me! This is all because we now allow you not to hide your face behind the veil. We could never hear women complain earlier. They'd only murmur behind the veils. Stay within your limits. She wants to attend a wedding! Tell me, what will you do at a wedding, huh? Do you want to go there and get drunk? Or do you want to keep the money in your mouth and offer it to the singer? Huh? What will you do at the wedding, huh? She is your mother-in-law, son. You shouldn't talk to her like this. Don't try to be like Juhi Chawla, Mother. Do you want to attend a wedding too? Pack your bags and go stay with your daughter. Mummy, your sons won't take you back. So you can only join an ashram and sing hymns. You don't like staying here. They want to attend a wedding! I will attend the wedding! Whose? I am not asking you, I am telling you. Go down right now and tell everyone that your wife will attend the wedding. You want me to do that? You know what happens there? Drunkards fight. Why do you attend it then? I too won't attend it. Happy now? I just want my rights, And you want to loose yours as well! You need to decide, today. You should say that I can attend a wedding. You should support me. Or... Or you cannot sleep on my bed. You go and sleep on a separate bed. You should drag such a woman by her plaits and throw her out. Get lost! Don't make me break your knees! Who does she think she is? Look at her staring at me! Like a cat staring at milk! Get lost! Don't make me break your knees! Will you leave or not? - Such stubborn women are... - You want to suppress women. You want everything to happen your way. Turn on the fan. Who will turn off the lights? You only know how to order us around. Come. They are sitting over there. Greetings, Sister. Greetings Welcome, welcome home. It's jangir's younger brother's pre-marriage ritual tomorrow. - Be there on time. - Okay. Bholi alone cannot invite everyone, so we thought we'd help her out. - Greetings. - Okay. Where is the bride from? From your daughter-in-law's village. Oh great. They fixed it during Bagga's wedding. - I see. - Hmm. She is Patwari's daughter. - That's great. - Bye. Grandma, we won't attend the rituals. We'll attend it only if they let us attend the wedding. Otherwise, the men can sing and celebrate on their own. Why do they think about us only for these rituals? Hmm. No dear, let it be. We all got scolded. I heard a few were even thrashed. Drop the idea, dear, if they don't want us to go. Grandma, when we keep milk in a bowl, the cream always floats to the top. It is easy to collect it. But what happens when we keep the milk in a churner? Does it give us butter on its own? It doesn't, right? - Ask me why. - Why? Because a bowl is like a woman, and the churner is like a man. Men are not as simple as women. We need to churn them... to get butter. We'll have to churn our men to control them. They won't give us anything easily. Aman, put some veggies in a bowl. Grandma, we won't get anything that easily. We had to fight a lot of wars to free our country too. This will be our first fight. Aunty, take this box and use this excuse to tell Aunt Madhuri that we won't attend it. No, dear. Go, dear. Don't you want to enjoy meat? You want to spend your life eating just the gravy? Go, dear. Go. "Come home and I'll teach you a lesson." - Get lost. - "Why didn't you come with elder brother! You home, Sister? Come on in, Sister! I am coming! I am coming! What was my sister doing? You know the usual, the chores never end. Here Sister, I brought some lentils for you. - Jeeta isn't home? - No, he isn't. - He isn't. - No. Look Sister, our daughter-in-law says, We cannot act like a coward anymore. Why? You'll have to be brave and take stand like Madhuri from "Beta" film. Which movie is that? "Your voice is as sweet as the cuckoo." She teaches everyone a lesson. - Really? - Hmm. Bhairav! I challenge you to touch me! I challenge you too to touch me! Jeeta! I challenge you to touch me! Sister, we won't go to Jagir's place to sing songs. You are right, Sister. Let me empty the box. You can take it back. It's okay, Sister. I'll take it some other time. You can return it, whenever you make meat. Seebo! Seebo! Yes, Sister? - What are you doing? - What else can I do? Take this. What is it? - Listen... - Yes? - Charno paid me a visit. - Hmm? You know what she said? She said we won't go there to sing. - You are so smart. - Your tea, Father. Where are all the women, dear? Don't you want to sing songs? No one showed up, Father. Why? Who will play the games with him? They say they'll attend only if they get to attend the wedding. The wedding! You are back at it! I didn't say that. That's what the women said. Which woman said it? I don't know who said it. You don't know, huh? You women never learn a lesson the easy way. Come, let me teach you a lesson. Keep walking, get in. Tell me who said it! - You...! - Mummy! - Who is it! Damn... - Huh? Mr. Hakam Singh Dhillon. Grandpa, women of your house are trying to ruin our women. They want to attend the wedding. You deserve a medal. This poison was spread across the village through your box. See for yourself. Bagga. Yes? Call your grandma. Hmm. What is wrong? Why is everyone gathered here? It's nothing, Uncle. Go upstairs. When you don't owe land, why are you stressing about the crop? Hmm. So you want to attend the wedding, huh? My knees don't work. What will I do there? I cannot even walk in our courtyard. Is this your doing? What will we do at the wedding? We only eat lentils with flatbread. Whether we eat here or there, doesn't matter. It's not like we will eat chicken? I have put a cold compression on Sister's head. She is shivering. Don't beat her up. She is innocent. Your foreman's name is on the box. This box came from your house. Ask the new daughter-in-law. Mother, isn't this the same box that went missing? Yes, dear, it's the same. Someone is conspiring against us, to ruin my husband's reputation. I told everyone that we should attend the wedding. I told you she is responsible for this fiasco. Grandpa, tell me, how am I wrong? What harm will come if we attend the wedding? Mothers give birth to their sons. They look after them. Then comes their wedding. Don't mothers have a right to watch their sons get married? This is wrong. Grandpa, Women should also be heard. Your mother was also a woman. What could go wrong if we attend the wedding? Our whole family will be together in the photos too. Right? Well said. Thank you. You wanted me to marry her, Father? Thank you, God, for saving me. Enjoy the consequences now. Take her back. We don't want her. She is na√Øve. - We will talk to her. - Hmm. She won't do it again. Don't ruin the wedding. This will exaggerate the matter. Take her back. Grandpa's word is final. That's it. Father... What is he doing? I take her guarantee. My daughter will never say a word again. This is ridiculous, Uncle. How can you take her guarantee? She is not a ceiling fan! We told you to take her back. Just take her back. Mother, pack her bags. Pinta! Get up. Sit. Don't say such stupid things. You are a man, Darshan Singh. They are just like cattle. They have no sense. They don't know how to behave at a wedding. They say mothers don't get to see their sons get married. Ask her who welcomed them home? Me or Bagga's mother? We should follow our customs. They were formed by our elders. Or your daughter is the one to outsmart everyone? You are right, Brother. Rani... Apologise, dear. Go, dear. I made a mistake, Grandpa. I won't say it again. I will keep quiet. I will always keep quiet. If I find even a single chicken bone missing... I'll thrash the one who is responsible for it. Bagga! Bagga! Yes, Grandpa? Son, it's your fault. Have you ever seen our wives speaking up? Has anyone heard your grandma speak against me? No one even heard her speak for the first two years of our marriage. They must have only heard her cry. I never let her speak up. I thrashed her to keep her in line. Listen son, you always need to keep your wife under your thumb. If you don't then she will get you into trouble. Listen, she will be a little scared right now. So you don't need to go and cajole her. Go inside and give her two slaps. She is scared so you will be able to control her. Today she wants to attend the wedding, tomorrow she will want to go to a movie hall. If you want her at your service for life, then go and thrash her right away. Got it? Go then! What are you waiting for? Go! Eat. Thank you, God! You answered my prayers! - This will be fun! - Why are you begging me now? Didn't you know? How dare you do this! You weren't going to stop, were you? Why are you begging me now? Don't you understand when I talk to you politely? You have ruined our reputation. You are acting smart What will you get by attending the wedding, huh? What will you get by attending the wedding? You won't do it again? You won't do it again? You are sorry? What do I do with your sorry, huh? I don't want to hear a word! Speak another word and I'll strangle you. I'll chop off your tongue if I hear you say another word. Are you okay? Uncle! He will be joining us soon. Give me a high five! He might lose his wife, but that doesn't mean you will gain one. You are behaving like I used to. You too will be the A black spot to our family's reputation. Black spot? No, Pinta. You cannot die single. If you cross 35, you can steal someone's wife. If you cross 40, you can make do with a woman left because of dowry. If you cross 45, you can marry a foreigner. If you cross 50... If you cross 50? That's when trouble begins. You won't find any solution then. Yes. Grandma, I don't want to get married. You carry on. I'll join you after 10. You couldn't stop yourself, could you? Did you get a medal for it? - Here, Mother. - You can fool others, but I know you very well. You are doing this to get a divorce, aren't you? Stay put there. The very boyfriend who is instigating you will not even accept you later. I told you before you left that your husband is your king. Why did I even bother? You had no interest in paying heed to it. If you want to cause trouble, then do so after I get married. You can trouble Father all you want then. Rani, come here, my child. Sit. You go get tea for your sister-in-law. Okay. So, what do we do next? I don't want to attend any wedding. I am fine over here. Why, did the sound of the sandals hitting the walls scare you? I know what sandals hitting the body sounds like. We will attend the wedding. Men have been suppressing us for centuries. Yesterday, if your mother had been here, she would have fought for you. One idiot went down on his knees and the other forgave him. Two men decided on the fate of a woman. What did we ask for, huh? What did we steal anything from them? We just want to see our sons get married. If he is his grandfather then I am not his grandmother? The same grandmother always who carried him around the house. Can't I enjoy his wedding? Dear, if you are unable to turn milk into curd the first time then you should try again. They are like stubborn churners. They won't let us get the butter so easily. Listen girls, you will get married. Don't be scared of marriage. I didn't have a mother. You have us. No one would dare to hit you! He didn't value the respect he got. Now I am not Dilip Kaur if I don't teach him a lesson. Be strong, girls. Good, I'll finally get to eat meat if I'm destined to, otherwise, the gravy is tasty as well. "We will fight, Sister." "We won't give up, girls." "Stop it, Sister." "Or they will break your bones." "Stop being stubborn, girl." Enjoying the show, huh? "what business do you have among women?" Everyone has to pitch in to watch a movie. You don't have a wife, so you shouldn't be here. Stand up. Go check our buffalo, she has diarrhea. Her calf is covered with dung. "We will fight, Sister." "We won't give up, girls." "Stop it, Sister." "Or they will break your bones." "Stop being stubborn, girl." "We have been thrashed enough." "It is time to teach them a lesson." "Trust us, Sisters." "We will bring about new changes." "All those who are being stubborn, Sisters," "We will teach them a lesson." They are like radios. You need to give them a whack to get them working. "We will go there by cars." "Don't feel scared, girl." "We will enjoy meat there, girl." "Stop it, Sister." "Or they will break your bones." "Stop being stubborn." "Stop it, Sister." "Or they will break your bones." "Stop being stubborn." Don't be scared. I support you. You are such a coward. You cannot say a word in front of Grandpa. What do I do with your support, huh? Being a man you don't support men, then how will you support us women? You are a traitor. You women are no different than men! You too are behaving just like Grandpa. You want to overthrow Grandpa's reign, and be the man of the house, right? This isn't supporting men or women. This is about supporting what is right or wrong. And I am supporting what is right. What did I say wrong? Did you accept me? It would have been better if I had gone downstairs and sang this song in front of Grandpa. It would be better if I hit you with my sandals and then go down and have meat with Grandpa. I made a mistake. Please forgive me. But I am a traitor. Please forgive me. Oh no, someone's very angry. I didn't know I have a husband who gets upset like a girl. Please forgive me. "Look at my moon," "Look at my moon," "He seems upset." "It looks like he is still fuming with rage." "He is behaving like a kid." "His cheeks are puffed like a puffer fish." "I have brought everything available in the market." "I have tried to cajole him with gifts." "It looks like he is angry with me." "It looks like he is still fuming with rage." "Look at my moon," "He seems upset." "It looks like he is still fuming with rage." - Uncle! - Hmm? It looks like we have two peacocks dancing on the other terrace. No, no, no. I think there are two cats. Look carefully, it could be two snakes, the ones who are going to bite you any minute now. "I think I will have to use tricks to make him laugh." "I will have to find a way to make him smile." "He keeps making me beg all day." "What do I do about this?" "I have tried everything I could." "It looks like he is still fuming with rage." "Look at my moon," "He seems upset." "It looks like he is still fuming with rage." "I would do anything to make him smile." "But it can't rain without clouds." "I will make him talk to me." "I will make sure the fire is extinguished." "You cannot steal the heart..." "You cannot steal the heart of the one who is upset with you." "It looks like he is still fuming with rage." "Look at my moon," "He seems upset." "It looks like he is still fuming with rage." Have you decided what to do next? I've stopped thinking from the time I learnt that you care about me. You know everyone had had given me the responsibility to make sure we attend the wedding. His wedding will take place in two days. Who knows when the next wedding will take place? But... We won't be able to attend this wedding. No, you fool, don't fill your eyes with tears. I won't be able to look into them and tie a turban. Nain! No, your eyes. I have your support, right? Yes, you do, even if you aren't formal with me. I made a mistake, Grandpa. Please forgive me. I made a mistake, Father. Actually, the Nain who had come with me... She told me to do this and do that. She told me to do this and do that. She asked me to insist to ensure my in-laws remain under your control. I made a mistake, Grandpa. Ouch, that hurts. Forget controlling my in-laws, Grandma. I got thrashed because of Nain. May Nain rot in hell. No boy could ever beguile me. But women like Nain managed to ruin and fool me. He hit me and I learned my lesson. His mute wife used to talk nonstop. He taught her such a lesson that now she won't talk even when asked to. May God give long life to the men who get us back on track. Women like Nain are vicious to the core. Nain said if men can have meat, then why can't women have them too? That's why I hide some the liver pieces in the bowl. Father had a toothache so he was looking for liver pieces and I got caught. Next time I hid a drumstick. And Father kept looking for the other drumstick. I didn't know men have every piece of the chicken memorised. I got caught again. Remember, you had said that you'd break both my legs if I ever had a drumstick again? That isn't something women should eat. I swear on the dung, I never ate it again. That vicious Nain. I made a mistake, please forgive me. I made a mistake, please forgive me. We got beguiled by Nain, Brother. I had heard about boys getting beguiled, but Nain managed to beguile us, women, as well. I made a mistake, please forgive me. I made a mistake. That is true. Women like Nain mislead our women. Right. They always act bossy, Uncle. It'd be better if we don't let old women from outside enter our village. So how do we solve this problem? We need a woman to escort the bride. No one would send their daughter with just men. Let's take a few women with us. Who said that? Speak up. Who is the smart guy? It's me, Grandpa. Jeeta's mother gave birth to a gem. So, it's decided. We will take a few women from our village with us. We won't let any Nain come here. "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Come, my girls" "Come, mystery to her fellow girls." "Let us shine bright." "You are new here." "You are a beauty." "You are new here." "You are a beauty." "We have left the path to our dreams behind." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "Let us look up at the sky." "Let us throw caution to the wind for a change." "Let us have a right to sun and shade." "Come, let's sing a song that celebrates life." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "What is the use of throwing caution to the wind?" "Birds will always go back to their cage." "Sparrows cannot fly too high." "We too had big dreams once upon a time." "You are new here." "You are a beauty." "We have left the path to our dreams behind." "You are new here." "You are a beauty." "We have left the path to our dreams behind." "Let us open the closed book of our dreams." "Let us claim a right to smile." "The questions are easy," "But the answers are tough," "Let the moonlight of knowledge brighten the dark sky." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "What will you get in a dried out garden anyway?" "We should stay within our limits." "We should always follow the orders." "We should stay grounded." "Rivers lose their existence once they enter the ocean." "You are new here." "You are a beauty." "We have left the path to our dreams behind." "You are new here." "You are a beauty." "We have left the path to our dreams behind." Aman you, Bholi sister you, And Mrs. Tailor you. You Three will go. Our openers. Sister-in-law, you too come with us. Considering what I have done, everyone will get suspicious if I attend it. - True. - You are right. Wait here. Sister, if they serve any sweets, make sure you fill your pockets with them. Okay. You will get to enjoy a feast. Okay. I'll get some for you as well. Okay. Stubborn plants break stones to sprout. I would have taken up a job, if you hadn't forced me to get married. You have turned me into a rebel, Sister. We have wedding guests coming to your village tomorrow. Yes, I know. The same bunch of hoggers. I have already warned Jinder to steal a bowl full of Gulab Jamuns. Your guests won't leave any for us. We will also have women attending the wedding. Be ready to serve them. This will be the first wedding in our whole area that will be attended by women. Are you high on something? Women will attend a wedding? Let me sleep, Mrs. Rebel. I need to go steal Gulab Jamuns at the break of dawn. "We need a representation in this world." "Let us get together and form a new identity." "We will form new rituals and customs." "We will move ahead, one step at a time." "Let us sing a new tune for a change." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "Come, my girls" "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "Come, let's solve this mystery," "Let us shine bright." "Let us throw caution to the wind." "Teach us how to spread our wings." "We hold our dreams and desires in our hands." "We will turn our veils into wings and fly away." "We won't let our feet touch the ground." "The sky too will bow down to us." "We will colour the world pink." Look, the dancers. Come with me. - "Move the beds closer, I am feeling cold." - What is wrong with them? "Move the beds closer, I am feeling cold." Madam, aren't you the background dancer from the Govinda movie? Right? What is he saying? - It's her. - Have a cold drink. Stay away. Have it. Should we get a cola instead? - At least tell me your name. - Such a pervert! - You just wait there. - Father! Father, they were flirting with us. Hold this. Jeeta! Jeeta! - Come here, Jeeta! - Coming! Hold this. Uncle! You idiot! You always mess up everything! - You are always wrong! - What's wrong, Uncle? Tell me what's wrong! What are you doing here? Bagga! Take them back home! Come on! Take them home. "We are celebrating a joyous occasion!" "This is a match made in heaven!" "Lucky is the house and ground where we dance!" Didn't you see this coming? You went like it's your right to. This woman acts too smart. How many times have I told you not to listen to her? She will embarrass you one day for sure. Shut up. You are her brother-in-law. It's okay, Grandma. It is okay to joke with a fellow educate person. Right, Sister-in-law. Sister, there is a call for you. Your guests didn't turn up. I was waiting for them. The guests, as usual, blood hoggers, don't leave a single Gulab Jamun for us. You are educated, right? Why don't you teach them some manners, hmm, Mrs. Rebel? I know what you are trying to do here. You are finding ways to step out of the house. You just wait. The day your love letters get caught, your in-laws will beat you to a breath away from death. Sister, please let me get married, before you do anything. He always takes her side. I agree that she is beautiful. But looks can be deceiving, right? I have an idea. But it's tough to execute. We will have to take matters into our hands. What we say should happen. Until now, we have been expecting them to do so. But how will that be possible? They never do as we say. Grandma, what if we set up my sister Nikko with Pinta? - Yes. - Then we will become the matchmaker. Then we can play our game. But what if they take over our game? We will be beaten off the ground. You get scared for no reason, Aunty. Nothing will happen. Your husband hits the walls and not you, Sister. Nothing will happen to you. Ask girls like Bholi what happens. Why are you all so scared? It's not like they have been showering flowers at you. All those who want to attend a wedding put your hand on top of my hand. Sister, we forgot what we came here for. Let's go, come on. Come, have a seat. She is beautiful. Very beautiful. Here's your gift. Sister, their boys are so-so, but they have managed to get beautiful daughters-in-law. O' Mother! Water. Grandpa, we should start thinking about getting Aman married. Brother is still studying, right? Yes, you are right. Minder. Yes, Father? Find a match for her. The one who doesn't make too many demands. Okay, Father. Oh no, Sister-in-law got me trapped in this. Quiet. It's okay. Dear, we were supposed to go attend our son's wedding, not our daughter's. - Right. - Grandma, this is just to get things started. I just pressed the button. Its effect will be visible somewhere else. Hmm? During Maharaja Ranjeet Singh's reign Punjab was India's most flourishing state. Did you realise what just happened there? What? You didn't realise? She won't let you get married. She purposely spoke about getting Aman married. I don't know what spell she did on Grandpa, he agreed immediately. They are sure to get Raman married right after Aman. She will make sure you become like Uncle. Why would I become like Uncle, huh? She will make sure you stay single, so that she can grab your share of land. How can you just take my share of land away? I am supporting you. She doesn't let me get close to her either. She is very cruel. She will take over my land as well as your land. I see. How will she get a son if she doesn't let you get close to her? Can't the one who can deceivingly take your land away from you, deceive me into having a son with her? Is that what your mother did to me? Kept me single to take over my land? Hold your horses, Uncle. My matter is more important than yours. Bagga, please talk to Grandpa. Tell him that Pinta is ready to get married. Like he will listen to you now. Why did you run away? Oh, my God! You lose your senses before you die. I was a fool to run away. Bagga, my brother, please help me out. What about progressing in life? It can go to hell. Get me married. Bagga, I cannot stay single like him. Please talk to Grandpa. Brother, you should show signs like you are having an affair with someone. Like you'd elope if we don't get you married. If his honour is at stake, he'll get you married right away. Great idea, Bagga. You are a true brother. I agree. Uncle, let me warn you, if you tell anyone about this then I shall inject you with that injection. Got it? I love you. Let's elope. Hey, if writing love letters can get one married, then should I write one as well? Your time is up, Uncle. No girl would agree to marry you. Stop wasting my time anymore now. Let's elope and get married. Yes. "I secretly read my brother-in-law's love letters." What do we do with it? Aunty, this is a bomb, which we will throw at my family. Do your sisters-in-law help you out with the chores, or they always keep their heads inside the books? They help, Aunty. They are nice girls. Hmm. Aunty, sweep over there, down there. I'm getting there, I'm getting there. I'll sweep the whole floor. Dear, check if this piece of paper is important. What is it, dear? Tell me what it is. It's nothing. How is it nothing? Tell me what it is. Speak up! - Yes? - Aunty... Aunty, it's a letter. A love letter. You will rot in hell! We are ruined! You are getting letters even after you got married! Don't hit me! Don't hit me! Aunty! What happened, Sister? Nikko was right, but we never listened to her. But what happened? Ask her. Aunty, this doesn't belong to me. - It belongs to Nikko. - Huh? - It's a love letter. - Nikko! I'll be damned! Don't scold her. Don't create a scene. Let's sit and talk. What is happening, Mother? Huh? A letter. Another letter! Pinta! Pinta is my brother-in-law. I'm so dead, Aunty! They had purposely sought a matchmaker. He ran away when he realised it was me. That's why I was married to his younger brother. - They had planned all this. - She has ruined my reputation. I say let's just kill her. Let's chop her into pieces and dump her body in the well. No one will find out. You cannot even cut grass properly, and you want to chop off our daughter? Make her drink pesticide instead. Grandma, why should we be like her? Let's get her married to him. We both sisters will be in the same house. No one will ever know. We will be able to keep the matter under wraps. How can we let our younger daughter marry the eldest son? What will people say? It would have been okay if she had eloped with him? Educated children are more sensible. God bless you, my child. You've managed to keep the matter under wraps. Otherwise, Nikko was all set to ruin our reputation. We would have to become murderers because of her too. Where is she? Mother, she has gone to get drinking water from the headman's house. It's okay. Calm down. "I travel in the palanquin," "and head to my beloved's place." "Stop me if you can." "I dance..." "To the beats." Why do you all look so sad? As if you caught her love letter? We found a letter. Shut up. Who all will you ask to shut up, huh? Everyone will condemn them. Have fun. Happy now? Didn't I say she is up to no good? Send her to college now! Educate a daughter, progress a daughter! Your daughter has progressed to the wrong path! Who is the boy? Shut up, you witch! Don't defame us. Tell us! They are getting you married... Really? to my brother-in-law Pinta. Huh? She wants to ruin my life! I hope the dogs bite your boyfriend's ankles! Why would I agree to marry the eldest son, you witch? But... Listen up, everybody. I'd rather become a hermit than marry any Pinta. Acting! Look at her acting! She is even better than Sridevi. She is more than what she seems. Don't get angry. Oh yes, she is the one who messed up, so why am I the one being punished for it? What is my fault? I beg you not to make a fuss. We are getting you married to him, so you better keep your mouth shut. So I am not even allowed to talk now? You have given her too much freedom! She loves us! She keeps everything under the wrap for us. You are the one causing trouble. You witch! What spell did you cast on them? My whole family has lost their minds. "Gol Gol Gappas!" (tangy snacks) The whole family is gathered at one place, Uncle! How about some snacks, hmm? Leave, no one is interested in having them. Come! Someone's daughter is about to elope. My snacks are as tangy and fresh as this news. Come on. You rascal! Wait there, I'll teach you a lesson! What happened? What are you saying? You rascal...! Grandpa, this is what has been transpiring. My family wanted to kill them. I barely managed to convince them not to. This is our family matter. Mother fainted as soon as she heard about it. Brother, she is talking about you. Look at Grandpa's sad face. - Should I make it more believable? - Go for it! "Even if your love is not true," "Come and show it to the world." "Come with an excuse to meet someone else." "Come with an excuse to meet someone else." - Your parents were right! - Grandpa! No! - We should just kill him! - Grandpa! He is nothing but disgrace to our family. - Don't kill me! - No, Grandpa! - Let me go, girl! - No! Stay put! - He will kill my son! - Let me kill him! Keep lying down. You have fainted. Let me go! Father will shoot us all if you get up. Stay put! No Grandpa, please don't do that. It will ruin my sister's life. Who else other than him will marry my sister now? - No, Grandpa. - It is your sister's fault as well! Both of them should be punished. They both have ruined our reputation. - Grandpa! - How is it her fault? We women never have any control over anything. A woman is like slippers that any man can wear. Slippers don't run away on their own. A woman is like a lost penny that anyone can pocket. A woman is like hay, that can be eaten by a horse or get blown away by the wind. A woman is like a dessert, keep it inside and Rat will eat it, keep it outside and the crow will steal it. "Those who are in love!" - I will kill you! - No, Grandpa! - I will kill you! - No, Grandpa! Don't do that! Don't kill him! Don't kill him, Father. Don't kill him! Ignore the song he is singing! Instead, pay attention to a mother's yearning tongue... I mean pay heed to a mother's yearning soul, Father. She married off her son. This one is the result of my bad karma. No one will marry your granddaughters if you kill your grandson. Aunty! Father, where will I keep the four of them? Spare him, Father. Please spare his life, Father. Don't make me kill you instead. Come here, dear. Come on, come on. Let's get this over with. Go and give a token gift to the girl. May God give you long life. Yes. - May God bless you, Grandpa. - Yes. Bye-bye, Uncle. I am all set now. I am no longer part of your community. I am going downstairs. Okay, bye. But you are Daughter-in-law's elder brother-in-law. Not anymore, now I am her sister's husband. She is now my sister-in-law. You can enjoy this single life. I am going to get married! By the way, that room on the terrace belongs to Bagga. So, this room will belong to me. Then what about me? You pack your bags and move to the room next to the door. Bye-bye. Why don't you just throw me out? Make me sit outside the door! Give it here. Go, offer them a dessert. We will finally be attending a wedding. Tell Sister Pammi to get ready. How are you, Sister-in-law? Where's my dessert? You can have it, Brother-in-law. I'll get Aunt some more. Thank you. I'll give you an overdose of sweets, just let Nikko come here. Look up there. - Teji! - Yes? Let's go upstairs. Let's go. They are pushing me into the well. No one is ready to talk to me. What harm have I done to you that you too have stopped talking to me? You have dishonoured us. Huh? You have made us wish we were dead! I am the one who is being betrayed, and you wish you were dead? There is no betrayal! Don't try to act too smart! You had an affair with Rani's brother-in-law. I'll slap you! Who said that?! Letters were found... love letters. Written by Rani's brother-in-law. For me? Hmm. Really? Who found them? Rani. Oh! Letters written by Rani's brother-in-law, were found by Rani. Are you getting it? Uh-uh. She is playing me. I am not Nikko if I don't teach her a lesson! I won't let my brothers feel dishonoured. Stay proud. You just need to do me one small favour. I'll sell my earrings and bring a cart full of chocolates for you. Hmm. Hmm? Come, my boy. Get inside the blanket. It's quite cold. Grandma, I found a letter on the bed. A letter? Uncle, I found this letter stuck in the bricks of toilet. It must be from that rascal Pinta. He wants to ruin our reputation. No Mother, this one is by some Binder. And the one I got is by some Minta. I read it all in the toilet. Why did you read it? Can't you read your schoolbooks! Go! Papa, this letter is from Sewak. It was in my shoes. Who is it addressed to? Nikko! Look at her sleeping after giving us sleepless nights. Don't do it! I'll meet you tomorrow, I promise. I'll jump the wall and meet you. Yes, I'll be there. I'll jump the wall. My family? I'll crush the pill you gave me and feed them with lentils. Call Rani. She will ruin our reputation. Grandma, then we will grow up to be dacoits. Wait, you rascal! Your sister is jumping off the walls and you want to become a dacoit! Look, what all she is up to. You could get into trouble in the future. She didn't just get one letter, she has 5-7 lovers waiting in line. We don't know where did we go wrong! Why are you defaming her, she has only 4 lovers. Why are you saying 5-7? You idiot, 4 lovers isn't an achievement either. Even a single love letter spells bad news. I suggest we kill her. Where is she? We have locked her upstairs. In her sleep, she said she'd add some crushed pills in our food. We don't let her do any work because of the same reason. Hello? Dear, Jagir is talking to the old man. He told him that they caught more letters. How did he find out? His brother is married in your village. His Brother's in-laws told him. Who went to Jagir's house? We don't know. Aunty, Nikko knows what our game plan is. She did this on purpose. Oh no. I'll handle the situation over here. You handle the situation over there. Make sure Brother Pinta doesn't find out about this. If this marriage doesn't happen, then We won't be able to get what we want. And we will get thrashed too. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Got it, Grandpa? I'll go and talk to him. Oh no. - Mother. - Yes? You handle the old man. I'll handle the snitch. We cannot give up so soon. Mother, if I die before having meat, I'm sure I'll come back as a stray dog. I'll keep biting people passing on the streets. Get up for my sake. Get up. Oh my my! How fortunate of me for you've have come to visit me. Welcome, dear! Welcome. Tell me, Mrs. Matchmaker, with which lover of mine will you get me to marry now? I am getting you married into my in-laws family because they are good people. The boy is nice too. He is much more educated than my husband. He'll soon get a job too. You two can stay in the city. Then we can send our children to the city school. Right! Yes! Don't try to fool me! You are not my well-wisher! Tell me what's in for you? Aunty, I won't marry to a common cat. You brainwashed him? You are an educated man. How could you get fooled by this illiterate? We all live a different life before we get married. Everyone does. Swear on your mother and tell me, don't you stare at girls in your college? But I don't get such letters like her. That's what I am trying to explain it to you. My handsome boy, you could never manage to woo a girl. Remember, you'll starve if you refuse the food being served to you. Just like Brother. What if the ones who wrote the letters followed her here? Who does that? They will stay there, get drunk and listen to sad songs. Aunty, you know the thing is... You don't like the respect I'm giving you, do you? Get lost from here! Who are you to interfere in our family matter? I'll throw you down from here, you plague spreader! I am not going to listen you, Aunty. I can't be fooled. Then suffer. Brother, teach him how to color grey bread. What is the problem? We all live a different life before we get married. It is not a big deal. Past always stays in the past. Leave her, tell me about you. Did you had any life before marriage? That's why are you defending her? A mother gives birth to her son, and can't even attend his wedding. This right is what we want. We have tried many things, Nikko. Now I'll use the excuse of your affair with him, And by becoming the matchmaker I'll lie to both families. Here, I'll tell them that they insist. And there, I'll say that they insist to make women attend the wedding. You are such a liar. Yes, I am a liar. I will tell 100 lies. It is our right. For God's sake, join us in this revolution, Nikko. You'll understand the sorrow once you'll become a mother. Moreover, we don't even get any sweets or desserts. We are lucky if there is any left after the guests. Otherwise, nothing. You wouldn't understand! I wouldn't understand! I know everything! I never had a Gulab Jamun (sweets)! But Wait a minute... Will I get Gulab Jamun if I support all of you? Of course, you will. We will get everything if we attend the wedding. You will surely get it even if no one else gets it. I promise you that. You all will attend the wedding, but first, you have to promise me, that you will give me Gulab Jamun in a plate. I will. Oh my my! I'll eat Gulab Jamuns at my wedding! I'll personally serve them to you. And, Pinta is really a very nice man. I don't care about that. Even if he is not nice, I'll handle him. But if you don't get me Gulab Jamuns, I'll gouge your eyes out and have them instead. Fine, just call Pinta and calm him down. Let's go. Here. I'm feeling shy! Look what they have done while feeling shy If they didn't feel shy they would've even corrupted God. Talk to him. Hmm. Go. Hello? Hello? If you can write letters to get married, then can't I write it to call it off? Sister just told me that you are a nice man. That's why I agreed. My Sewak, Binder and Minta, all are you. We'll talk later, okay? Otherwise, we won't have anything to talk about after our marriage. Okay, nice to talk to you. He is your elder brother-in-law, right? So, that means I am your elder sister-in-law. So, I'll be in command, right? It's nothing, Grandpa. All the letters were written by Brother. He used to write with different names. Why did he have to do that? - So that they didn't get caught. - It's nothing, Father. These modern girls and boys like role-play. What play? Role-play! Boys like to keep different pet names. Like no matter what we cook - chicken, goat, fish. We call it all meat, right? Similarly, Pinta is meat. Chicken, goat, fish, pheasant... They are all his pet names. - But they all taste different. - Right. You are right, Father. Just like that, these girls and boys use different names to fulfil their different tastes. Just like Mother calls you by using different names! Beast, Tormentor... Darling husband! They use these names affectionately, Father. Fine. Then let's get this over with. The sooner it is done the better. Okay, Father. They got together again like a bunch of thieves. They found love letters from four boys and yet the old man agreed to get them married. What are they doing? Something is fishy. Take this, girl. Our men don't agree. They said we should just bring you with us. Who will attend the wedding of such a girl! No, Grandma. We will lose our reputation. What will people say? They will say that something is fishy. It will ruin my father and my uncle's reputation. Right. Men say that she is an over-smart woman. We cannot take the risk of a proper wedding procession. She cannot be trusted. Who knows, she might file a case against the guests. The boy is equally responsible for this. Right. It's not just our daughter's fault. That is the problem, Sister. Men say we won't risk bringing other men to the wedding. They are young blood, we don't want them to face each other. What if they cause more trouble? Don't say that, Grandma. You may bring some women to the wedding if want. There will be nothing to fear if their mothers and sisters are with them. What will women do at the wedding? This is not acceptable to society. We will be going against the society. Look, we are thinking about your reputation. And all you care about is society. Well it's okay then. You think about the society. But she has a loose character. The way she wooed our boy. Who else would agree to marry her? Tell this Barbie doll to stop it before I bite her. What do we have to do with the society, Father? We should think about our family first. Hmm. Grandma, it's a request. I know it will be difficult, but please attend the wedding with the men. This way both families will be able to keep their reputation intact. Fine. Although, it's an inconvenience, we will do it, to keep our son's honour intact. Oh no! You almost killed us! They are back! Grandma, you go and talk to him, okay? No, you do it. No, Mother. I cannot. - You'll get me killed! - Ask her to do it! No, Sister. She is mute. How will She speak? - Aunty, you talk to him. - Fine. Oh God, please help me. - Let's go. - Let's go. We have never been this insulted! - How is this right! - What time have come! Father, we refused outright! They say we don't want to cause a scene by allowing men from the village where such a characterless boy lives! They said to bring the women along for the wedding! I said no way! Our village doesn't follow such customs! They want us to attend the wedding! This is a man's job! It is not right for women to do it! They said then keep your boy single. We said why not. He will give company to the other bachelor. It won't hurt us. But who would agree to marry them, Aunty? It doesn't take long for the news to spread. And how can we agree to something we all women got thrashed for? No! You all are senseless and you gave them a senseless reply! What harm would come to you if you attend the wedding, huh?! Tell me, don't you want to keep our family's honour intact? We'll do anything you say, my darling husband! If you say, I'd jump into the clay oven. I will attend the wedding if you say so! Let's go inside, Mother. Stop it! I requested them a lot. But they didn't agree! She will get us into trouble! Mother! Come, let's prepare dinner! Coming! Witches! They don't even let me sit with my old man. I barely had him under my thumb. Huh? 'Only the women in your family are invited to attend the wedding procession.' "We have stayed back." - Like hell, you'll attend the wedding! - "We have stayed hidden." - What will you do at the wedding? - "We have lived our lives in fear." "We have closed the doors of our heart," "either cried or felt shy." "We have to wake up our destiny." I made a mistake, Grandpa! I won't say in again. I will keep quite. I will always keep quite. "We will write our own destiny." "If someone would have asked women's wish," "women would have also expressed themselves." "If someone would have asked women's wish," "women would have also expressed themselves." "Say welcome, we have guests." Girls will attend our wedding? Get down before I hit you! They want to embarrass us. Don't you dare ever do such a thing again! "Decorate our veils with ribbons and glitter." "Let this glitter nurture your dreams." "Carry along the bag of songs, girls."

What else should we add to the menu? It was easier with the men. Meat and alcohol, end of the story. How do we know what women like to eat? Panjiri. (Sweets) Write Panjiri(Sweets). You idiot! They are coming for a wedding and not for a child's birth! Gulab Jamun. My family had asked for it. Add that. They cannot demand anything. This is not a proper wedding. We are making the best of the situation here. Uncle, we are at fault here. They have agreed to take a girl who has had four boyfriends. They have a right to make a few demands. Just get this over with. Give them what they want. She has such a loose character! She is marrying one of her boyfriend, leaving the other three to cry like dogs. She is dancing with joy after dumping other three boyfriends. What time has come! - Hello. - Yes? We have come here to book your stall for the wedding. Are you drunk, Brother? Who will eat Gol Gappas at a wedding? Don't ruin my day's wage. This is something women like to eat. Its tangy water will sober the men. We have women attending the wedding. Take these plates. I think you guys are drunk. Have two and you will sober down. Come on, Brother. "Gol Gol Gappas!" A daughter-in-law who got fed up with her in-laws' demands lodged a complaint with the police and got the whole family arrested! My gol gappe are even fresher and tangier than this news! - Mangal! - Yes? Where are you going? Mangal! Wait! Where are you going? Just hear us out. Wait, Brother! Mangal! Why are you so scared? We won't hurt you. We have women attending the wedding. We want to book your stall for the whole day. This is what women prefer to eat. - Women? - Yes. I'll be there. How many women are you expecting? 50 from their side and the same from our side. Around 100. Done! Sure! Hmm. 100 women, two servings per woman so 200. Five pieces per serving so 1000 pieces. Men too would want to try it out, so 1200, no 1500 pieces! You just hit a jackpot, Mangal! God, if this becomes a tradition and women start attending the wedding regularly and I will set up my stall there then I will no longer have to sell them door to door! Gol Gol Gappas! 10, 15... Sister-in-law at least give us our dresses for the Jaggo function. I have been asking you for them for many days now. You keep postponing it. You have kept orders from all across the country, Mrs. Businessman. When will you stitch my Safari suit, darling? Why do you need a suit, son? It's not like you are going to attend the wedding. Why? The invites are only to women. Only women? Oh, I have kept your white kurta and pyjamas out. You can wear that and guard the house, until we come back. 'Only the women in your family are invited to attend the wedding.' We will miss a party because of them. "We are here to celebrate tonight!" "Jaggo is here!" "It's time to celebrate, Jaggo is here! "It's time to party, Jaggo is here!" "It's time to celebrate, Jaggo is here! "It's time to party, Jaggo is here!" "The groom's grandmother is delighted!" "The groom's grandmother is delighted!" "The groom's grandmother is delighted!" "The groom's grandmother is delighted!" "When we were young, my cruel tormentor..." "You were a circle and I was drunk, my cruel tormentor..." "You were a circle and I was drunk, my cruel tormentor..." "You..." What has happened? There is something wrong, jeeta! Grandpa was so stubborn. He could not be handled easily. His grandson is getting married And he's sleeping in his room. There is something wrong! Whatever is it, We are left behind, my friend. We don't even know what we have to do here when they'll be attending wedding. "No one can compete with my brother today!" "No one can compete with my brother today!" "No one can compete with my brother today!" "The path my brother took to become a groom..." "The sand of that path has turned into sugar." "The path my brother took to become a groom..." Bye, Father. Something is wrong, Father. Stop hitting it! It won't start working like that. See! It's working! Let me try that with my radio. I'll be damned! You managed to fool the whole village! You have betrayed me! You have made me lose my reputation in whole village! I should go and stop them first. Then I'll felicitate you for this after I come back. Wait here. Look, is this your money under the trunk? You...! Open it! Open the door! Open the door! I'll be damned! Come back! Such behaviour makes women lose their lives. Come back! - Open the door! - What's wrong? Why is he shouting? Father, the room with cotton in it caught fire! - I'll be damned! - Come, Father! - Open the door! - Jagir! - Don't let her leave! - Cotton caught fire! Open the door! Why did you lock me inside? "I have got the material from Lahore, my brother." "I prepared you a nice headgear, my brother." "I have attached flowers to it, my brother." "A sister's love is precious." "I have got the material from Lahore, my brother." - my brother." - Sister Rani, listen to me. My husband found out the truth. I have locked him in his room. I don't know what he will do. Stop the rituals and quickly get onto the bus. - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Let's go! Let's go! Hurry up! Where did everyone go? Ask the bus driver to start the bus. Let's go! Let's go! Where is everyone going? Let's go! Hurry up! I'll handle them! I got Jagir's call. Huh? Such a big betrayal? Father! Father! - Father! - Uncle! Uncle! Listen to me, Brother! I won't listen to you! I will tell him the truth! Listen... He won't stop making calls. Do one thing, cut the telephone line of his house. Okay. The women have outsmarted us, Jeeta! What is wrong? Why are you panting? We cannot step out of our village anymore. What have these women done now? The senseless ones have managed to fool us! They managed to fool us! Tell me what... You listen... Hello? You witch, you broke the telephone line! Don't these men always tease you for being single, Brother? - Have we ever teased you? - Exactly. We still add ghee to the lentils for you. We can get you a divorcee. We will do something for you. Have these men ever done anything for you? And brother, you don't have any women in your life, That's why you don't know anything about our sorrows. I have an aunt, Sister. My uncle is dead. I'll get you married to her. What will I do with your aunt? Fine. I won't tell him. I'll hide it. You just sit and talk to me like this, from time to time. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! See you! What is wrong? I don't think I'll be getting married today. Oh God, I will die. They didn't even apply kohl in my eyes. You hold the mirror for me. Yes. Sing the song. "The first one's for good luck, my brother-in-law." "The other one is for good health." Stand up. Hurry up. Get in, hurry up. Wait, wait, wait, girl. Let's go. He must have informed the whole village by now. You leave, I will handle the situation here. Aunty, you are the one who started this. You deserve to go with us. So what, dear? It's not like I am going to die anytime soon. Don't worry. Once we dig the right path, the water will always flow our way. Don't worry. I'll die only after watching your son's wedding. Go on, my child. - Let's go! Let's go! - Get in! Get in! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Get in the Jeep! Hey! Take me along! Damn you! Get in the Jeep! Quickly! Wait... damn you! Grandpa! Grandpa! Where are you? Grandpa! We have been betrayed! Jagir gave me a call! We reputation is ruined! What's wrong? What's wrong? This was all planned by the women. They never invited the women. They convinced us with their sweet talk. They told them that we insisted, and they told us that they insisted. They have fooled you! Come with me! Start the tractor! Let's go! Let's go! I'll get the tractor start! Go, go, go! How will you have the wedding without me! Drive faster. Mother, if Father finds out about this, he won't even let us get there. Keep quiet. Everything will be fine once we get there. We have Chindo left behind. She will handle everything. This old man has been the bane of my existence. Now I'll show him what women can do. Yes. I'll teach him how to eat meat! Don't talk about meat. Can't you see where you are going, old woman? They didn't take you with them? Are you hurt? Drag her aside. You can ask about her well-being later. I am dead! I am dead! Ouch! She has heavy bones! I won't be able to do it alone. She looks so delicate. Come, help me. I'm coming! I'm coming! I'll help you! No! Step aside! You are my daughter's father-in-law. I'll die of shame! Don't touch me! Fine, I won't. I'll hold you by your feet! Lift her up. Let's get her off the road. Near the wall! Come on! Step aside! We are too late, Grandpa. Let go of your anger now. Let's go have some Gol Gappas. Here you go! No, I've had enough. Have it. You haven't eaten anything. One piece. No, I've had enough. You idiot, you don't trust me? What is wrong, Grandpa? You tell me, was I keeping you single on purpose? They have fooled us! Look at what a big scam they have created to attend a wedding! We foolishly fell for their trap! I'll be damned! Is that what happened? I won't get married, Grandpa. Yes. Let's go back. My word are final. That's it. Don't think about it. Let's go back. I cannot be trapped by anyone, Grandpa. Bagga and his wife will handle the situation. They are the one who started this, right? Now they will handle the downfall. Let's go! Let's go, everyone! Let's go! Son-in-law? Don't do that, Brother. I beg you. - Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! We cannot attend such a wedding! - What is wrong, Son-in-law? - You ladies, now see how we'll teach you a lesson! - Listen to me! - No! Brother Pinta! Get lost! You are a henpecked husband. Your wife has trapped you with her beauty. This is not what men do! Real men cannot be beguiled by a woman's beauty. Got it? Look over there! Let's go, Pinta! Forget this grandma's pet! What are you saying, Grandpa? A real man doesn't leave a woman at the altar. Let bygones be bygones. You should swallow the bitter pill. I cannot commit this sin. I will stand by my brother. Huh? One second. "Our party wears stayed hidden Packed in trunks." "We witnessed this day after a lot of praying." "No one can stop us today." "We will rock the dance floor!" "We will make some noise!" "Today, everyone will dance with us." "Today, I don't remember any sorrows." "We will make this a day to remember!" "We girls will make sure no one forgets this day!" "We will make this a day to remember!" "We girls will make sure..." "Listen boy, if you want to count my teeth..." "Listen boy, if you want to count my teeth..." "Then praise my smile!" "I know my hair got messed up while dancing!" "I know my hair got messed up while dancing!" "Tell me what I need to crush." "Tell me, if I need to fix a bed or break a wall." "We are not going anywhere today!" "The songs won't stop playing today!" "Our hearts beat to the tune of the music today!" "Even the ground will sing in our praises today!" "We don't care about the aftermaths of this day." "We will make this a day to remember!" "We girls will make sure no one forgets this day!" "We will make this a day to remember!" "We girls will make sure..." "You come and go as you please," "You look so beautiful."

"We don't know what limits we will cross today!" "We will make this a day to remember!" "We girls will make sure no one forgets this day!" "We will make this a day to remember!" "We girls will make sure..." 'That's it!' 'This is how the things changed.' 'Now they have 8-10 stalls serving snacks preferred by women.' 'Meat dishes, like fish and chicken' 'which are preferred by men had to take a backseat.' 'Men lost the game in such a bad way, ' 'that now the only thing they do in weddings is carry kids.' 'Women have completely taken over the wedding.' 'All the rituals are performed by women in upfront.' 'Men too have taken a backseat, just like the meat stalls.' 'Now men wait for a saviour, ' 'who would get their rights back from the women.' This was a short story from our small village. You can tell it to your kids as a bedtime story too. That reminds me, don't forget us when you get your kids married in the future. By the way, the Samosas (snacks) you had during the interval were catered by us. Thank you. "Gol Gol Gappas!"
