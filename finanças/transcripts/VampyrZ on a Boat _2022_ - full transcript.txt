We got it, man. Good. Hey, what's on the bottom of my mother-in-law's beer bottle? - What? - What's on the bottom of my mother-in-law's beer bottle? I don't know your mother-in-law. That's not the point. What's on the bottom of my mother-in-law's beer bottle? Open other end. Hey! Oh! Ah, uh, listen, I can tailor make the joke to whoever you want. Wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, misses, you name it. That hurts, that really hurts. Now open the door! What do you think's behind it? Oh, let me see. Riches beyond belief! - Let's see. - Good. What about my cat? You mean that one-eyed stray you rescued that hates every human being but you? Board her in a kennel like normal people do. She might get fleas. I'm not a big fan of fleas, Dell. Come on! It'll be like old times. I need ya on this, Max. I get seasick, Dell. It's not a boat, it's a ship. It's so huge you won't even feel the motion. I can't swim. You will never ever touch the water. This is the great thing about a boat, ship, it's like a block of dry land on the water. It's not my style. Style? I didn't know you had a style. Come on, you'll make a huge chunk of change for basically babysitting my cousin's boat, ship. I don't think so. Are you sure? - Hey, Dell. - Oh, Hi, Sarra. How's it going? Great. How you doing? I'm great. Who's your friend? This is Max. Hi, Max. Hi. So, are you gonna join our team on our little sea adventure? Oh yeah. I wouldn't miss it. Cool. Cool. See ya aboard. See ya on board. What? She's gorgeous. See you on board. And this is my cousin. Captain Bob. Hm, Delli boy says you have brass balls. Uh, they're much, much softer now, captain. So, you were a fixer for the deep state, cloak and dagger type stuff. They bring a gun, you bring a bazooka. Take no prisoners? Yeah, somethin' like that. Very nice you could join us, Max. - Captain. - Mm-hmm. Who's steering the boat? A ship. Whatever! Autopilot is a wondrous thing, Max. A wondrous thing. Aye, they're paying me a small fortune to allow them to do some testing out here in a beautiful open sea. Skeleton crew, no outside communications, and no firearms. And who's they? Well, they say they're from our side, but who knows? The important thing is the check cleared, me mateys. They cause no problems. They are no problem. He needs you and I to keep a close watch and try to find out what's really going on. Delli boy says you can be trusted. You have my word on it. So it's all settled then. I need you to protect my ship from any nefarious activities. Oh, you may not need to get involved at all, but my instincts, my instincts point to the contrary. There'll be no lootin' and lollygagging aboard my ship, me mateys. And what's with that leg? Oh, well this is the same walnut leg that- - Oak. - Whatever! This is the same leg that my father inherited from his father, and his father before that, and his father before that, a bull shark. Great white. Whatever! Some sinful shark took his leg to the black bottom of the open sea. And all I have is this, this ancient wooden relic, to remind me that danger lurks around every watery corner. And do you ever wear it? Only when the dignitaries show up. I like to put on a show for those loopy landlubbers, argh! Pretty bat. This is my setup. And I wanna tell ya, I'm master of the universe right here. I'm sure you are, Dell. I can watch every thing from here. Except that room. I don't know how they did it, but it's been blacked out. Now. See that red line? That's a person. Or, at least, I think it's a person. He hasn't moved, ever. And here's something else that's interesting. See that line? That's audio in the room. Hear that? That's the sound he's making. Now. That's the sound of bat makes. Somehow he's mimicking the sound of a bat. Maybe there's bat in the room, Dell. You have no imagination, do you? I'm telling ya, Max, something, something strange is happening in that room. Where is that? Directly below this deck. Hang a hard right at the bottom of the steps. And try to keep a shred of dignity. She may not be all that and a bag of chips. I'll keep that in mind, Dell. Yeah, I bet you will. I'm telling you Max. Something wicked this way comes. - Hey there! - Oh, hey, Max. Glad you could make it. Is there, is there something in my hair? What, what are you, what are you staring at? Do you believe and love at first sight? I think you're going a little too fast there, cowboy. I don't know you, and you don't know me. I'm just a cog in the wheel. Ah! A cog in the wheel? That's right. You know, you're not wooin' me, Max. Why don't you try telling me something personal? Come on, tell me something personal. Well, I have a tendency to drink too much and then laugh too loud. I have trouble being real. But I have no trouble fighting for what I want. And just for the record, I want you. What else? I get hurt easily. I try not to show it. And to top off my amazing life, I live with a one-eyed cat named Pie, and she thinks I'm outstanding. Oh, outstanding, huh? Mm-hmm. Now you. Come on. You. Okay, let's see. Uh. I live alone. Not because I want to, but because I haven't found the right guy. Guess I'm a little hard to please. I work too much and I sleep way too little. And I don't suffer fools lightly. So, be warned. And when I get hurt, I show it. So, be warned, again. I think I'm funny and clever. And all the guys that I've dated think I'm outstanding. Touche. So, you still love me, Max? Oh yeah. More than ever. You're movin' a little fast here, Max. I don't wanna move slow with you. Okay, well, if that's the case, my cabin is just around the corner. I always wanted to be a cabin boy. Okay then, cabin boy, follow me. You've got about 30 bloody people out there. They wanna rip my head off if they don't get some food. Rome was not build in a day. Excellence knows no timetable. And you, by the way, do not know how to count. Just looks like stew to me. Ah, but what a stew it would be. Five minutes to perfection. - I'll be back. - Hmm. Perfection. Absolute per- Argh! Ah, ah, oh. What the hell is going on in here? We've got a big problem. Where is the rest of her? We got a meeting with the doc. Miss me already, Max? I just wanna make sure you're okay. Oh, well that's we sweet. Sweet used to be my nickname. That's cute. I mean, sweet. Sweet. I think you should come with me. I think you should understand that I'm a big girl and I can protect myself. It's who's gonna protect you? That's the real question. I thought maybe you would? Hmm, I'd like that. Come on. Come with me. Gimme 10 minutes and I'll meet you, okay? All right. I'm going to give you my good luck charm. Oh. As long as you keep this, you're going to be safe. Okay. I promise that I will scream if anything out of the ordinary happens. But right now, a girl needs her privacy. So, go! Hey, Max. I believe in love at first sight. Let me reiterate that you have all signed confidentiality agreements. And what I'm about to share with you is part of those agreements. Aye. But what's in the darkened locked room, doctor? That. Well that is a being, over 400 years old. Conceivably, thousands of years old. Oh, it looks human enough, but it has no weakness in the conventional sense. I don't think we could kill it if we tried. But think of the possibilities, gentlemen. Maybe cures for all ailments and diseases. Maybe, maybe even everlasting life. Maybe everlasting death. We are on the brink of an evolutionary miracle, and he wants to say the sky is falling. Aye. I'm too jaded to believe in the fountain of youth! Then color me skeptical, doc. Open your eyes, Max. See the future. We are the saviors of that future. Well, what happened in the cafeteria? A mistake. But, nonetheless, an experiment that had to happen sometime. Better now. Those people, doc? Collateral damage, nothing more, nothing less. Well, you certainly have a funny pet here, doc. In our experiments, a single bite from our ground zero subject will either kill you or transform you. It killed the rat. How's Sarra involved? Well, you see, she was the first and only reporter on the scene when it... When he was captured. He became visibly agitated when he sensed her. So that's why she's here. I mean, we may need her to report, of course, but also- She's here for your testing experiments. She simply walked by the holding area and his vitals went through the roof. We need to know why. The people in the cafeteria were expendable. But Subject Ground Zero is not. We must have him alive and well. Are you saying he's escaped? Aye. I'm heading my ship to the nearest port, mateys. No, no, no, that's not possible, captain. If the infected were to break out onto terra firm a, we'd all be doomed. We need to capture and secure him. All others are expendable. That's why you're here, isn't it? Sarra! What's that now? We're too late. You heard the doc, that thing's not gonna hurt her. And Max, you may wanna brace yourself that Sarra's- What? You know, that she's not gonna be like she was. You may have to say goodbye to that Sarra. I live with a one-eyed cat, Dell. My entertainment is a local bar or a shooting range. She's the one. She's the only one for me. I need her like water in the desert, and I'm not gonna let anyone, or any thing, take her from me. Good to know. Aye, I don't care what that crazy doctor wants. I should be steering my baby to the nearest port, mateys. You really have no communications? They said they'll jam the ship. SOS won't even go out. And no guns? Not a one. And they blocked your surveillance cameras. How? Mine is not to wonder why. - Where to? - We find Sarra. Uh, we're in for a stormy night. Hell hath no fury like a man on a mission. Hmm. Grab a torch. Where is she? Did you see her? No, I didn't see anyone. Did you? Well, if you didn't see her, I surely didn't. Whoa, who are you guys? Ah, we work down in the engine room, we just came up for some food. Well, don't go into the mess hall. Why not? Any dummy knows that's where they keep the food. That was a good one. Sorry. Manners please. Manners snanners! I'm hungry! Well the... The mess hall food's infected. Always have been. Oh, you'll have to excuse us, we don't come up from below very often. You know, we just- - Oh, look at me, I'm all covered in grease. Oh, oh, all I do is work, work, work every day. Ah, ah, I can even reach the controls down there. Well, just, just, there, there. He's just kinda- - Exhausted. Oh, every day, all I do is just cry, cry. Oh, hey, hey. Hey, cheer up. Just, just put it under the chair and leave it there. Seriously? - Hey. - Okay. Hey, that's not funny. Yes it is, did you see how high that guy jumped? Now stop it. What's wrong with you? He, he's sorry. He, he really is. Are, aren't you? Aren't you? Oh. I'm sincerely sorry. Ah, dude, I didn't mean to scare you. Well thanks for that, that's much appreciated. Uh, you should go back down to your engine room. I'll let you know when it's safe to come up. Oh, goody. Now we can go down and eat some of that red sausage that I, I really love. Oh, don't exaggerate. Let's, let's just go. You know, that guy's goatee does not look right. You know, I've had many compliments on this goatee. Many, many compliments. Many compliments! Goatee. Yeah! What was that? Did you see her? She was, she was trying to bite me, Max. Who does that? We need to find Sarra. Wipe your face, Dell. Max! Don't forget me, Max. What? Anytime, Dell! What? I don't think, I don't think it's as bad as it looks. No! No. You were supposed to hit him with the hammer! Well, I've, I've heard of people with nails in their heads and they turned out okay. I have a hammer in my head now. Well, all I'm sayin', All I'm sayin' is that it could be worse, and I'm sorry. - What? I, I, I'm sorry. Oh, don't bother, doc. I can't do needles. Oh don't tell me you're scared of a little needle. Scared enough to rip your arm off if you come near me with that thing. Okay, if you feel that strongly, have it your way, but don't say I didn't warn ya. Here we go. Boy, that's really in there. Oh! Oh! Sorry about that. You know, the military invented the super fast acting superior glue. Medics used it on the battlefield to help glue wounds together to stem the bleeding. Worked like a charm. There you go. Good as new. You're just gonna have to be a little careful of that area for a while. Thanks, doc. - Batter up. - Let's find Sarra. Why aren't you infected, Max? Why? Remember, me mateys, the pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. And the optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty. You have to ask yourself; am I a pessimist or am I an optimist? Max! Max! What's my name, Max? What's my name? Say my name, Max. Sarra. Max. Max. Max! And we're back. Okay, it's game time. What? It's game time. Come on, it'll loosen the tension. You might even have some fun. And fun's not a bad word, you can do it, Max. Open up. I am open Dell. Yeah, sure you are. Hey, hang on. Okay, if you could be any baseball player in the 40s or 50s, who would you be? Just say a name. Pick anybody, just say a name. Ted Williams. Yes! The Splendid Splinter, the last 400 hitter. Some say the. Wait, wait a minute. Some say the greatest career hitter in all baseball history. Good choice. You know who would I pick? I can't wait, Dell. Hammerin' Hank Greenberg, Berg, Berg, Berg. One of the most beloved sluggers in Tigers history. Detroit, baby. Hey! Hey, man. You okay? I think so. It must have been something I ate. Yeah, I don't miss mess hall food. Yeah, me neither. I didn't think I ate that much. Maybe it's your nerves? What? Mess hall food scares me? It scares the hell outta me. Yeah, me too, if I'm honest. That. That scares me a hell of a lot more. I got this. We got this. Ah, no. Ah, no. No! No, Quaid! Cowboy up, Max. Don't tell me you're scared of a needle? Scared enough to rip your arm off. I'm giving you a chance, Max. Boy, that's really in there. Get down! You okay, Max? Um, yeah. - There you go. - Well, thanks, doc. You sure you're okay? Let's find Sarra. Oh my! Greetings and salutations. Who are you? I could ask you the same thing, but I won't. I'm Mr. Witz. I'm a long-term guest of the captain, if you must know. Define long-term. Hmm, will 17 years suffice? 17? I don't do well out there. And the captain was gracious enough to understand my frivolity, and offered me sanctuary. And what do you do for him? Well, I pay rent of course. And also sometimes we share a delightful dinner, complete with nostalgic reminiscences of days gone by. So you mainly stay in your cabin? Well the passageways can be kind of claustrophobic, but you get used to it. But I'm very content with my current humble abode. My lair, as 'twere. I rarely venture forth into the wild beyond. That's a good thing today. And why do you say so? The ship has, uh, an infection. Oh, paff! And I was just thinking of venturing forth. That's not going to happen. Oh dear, sweet baby Jesus. I guess I'll have to console myself with another delectable libation. Uh, would you gentlemen care to join me? Hmm, maybe another time. Yes. Another time. That would be most delightful. I assume you're on a quest of some sort. You could say that. I just did. I made a joke. Oh, that doesn't happen often. You have lifted my spirits. Well, adios, amigos, and happy hunting. Who wears a smoking jacket these days? Must be on the wrong boat. - Ship. - That's what I said. - You said boat. - No I didn't. You said boat. Max, I know the difference between a boat and a ship. Remember, me mateys, failure will never overcome us if our determination to succeed is strong enough. In other words, failure is not an option. It matters not that we fall. What really matters is that we rise, and rise again. You know, my mom worries about me a lot. She'll be very upset if you let anything happen to me. I got your back, Dell. Your mom can rest easy. I love my mom. She does have that nasty temper, though. Well, I see right through that. I mean, we talk every week, she needs me, she really does, Max. Okay, game time. You're on a desert island and you can have any actress from the 60s or 70s there with you. You know, sharing shenanigans. So, I know you're with Sarra, but just for fun, who would you pick? You hear somethin'? No. No. So, who would you pick? Max! - We're not in Kansas anymore. Huh! Steak dinner on me. Wow! The heart's the weakness. Like most of us, Dell. Like most of us. This is outta sequence. What's outta sequence? Did you see her? Only in my dreams, dude, only in my dreams. Hey! Manners, please. But. Uh, we didn't see anyone, did we? Not a living soul. Uh! Uh-oh. Uh, uh, oh no, I, I'm melting. I'm melting. What? You didn't see "The Wizard of Oz"? There's, there's no place like a dirty ship. There's no place like a dirty ship. You'll have to excuse us, we don't get up here that often. Well you should go back to your engine room, it's safer. There's an infection. Hey, how do you know that we work in the engine room. See, I told you we were getting a reputation. I'll have you know that we look great in a tuxedo, and you should see how we score with the ladies. A cha cha cha. What? I'm not gonna let those guys insult us. Especially that one. Hey, you! You know what? Your goatee sucks! What? We need to go, and you need to go. You don't have to tell me twice, I ain't no dummy. I like my goatee. As well you should. I get compliments all the time. You're singing to the choir. Now you're just being sarcastic. Sarcasms is just one of my many services, Dell. Max! Sarra! So tell me. Tell me about your life, Max. I wanna know all about you. Your dreams, my desires. And I want you to know about me. I'm not just a pretty face, Max. I'm pretty on the inside too. I'm giving you a chance, Max. Don't screw it up. Max! I need to find her! Remember, me mateys, believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more, so much more, more, more. There'll be no more shenanigans for you on this ship, matey. Don't go that way, there's a real big, bad one down there. Are you alone? Not when I've got this baby. Is there a female down there? A red head? Yeah, here's a female. Don't say I didn't warn y'all. What are you doing? What if we get caught? By who? There's no one on this hunk of metal. Why you think they didn't come to find us for our shift? I know, it's kind of change, right? It's 'cause they don't know what they're doing. And that's good for us. Pay and play, baby. What was that? Ghosts. No, I think there's someone there. We're alone. Stop being paranoid. We're just getting high. What? You're closer. Ugh. God, this floor is filthy. Pita? Pita! My mom called the other day. She asked how you were. She likes you, I don't know why. I like her too. She thinks you're a good guy. We're all good and bad, Dell. Even you. Max! What are you doing over there? I thought I heard something. Wait, come back! Did you see her? What was that? What is she running from? Why don't you come up and see me sometime? Oh, don't tell me you're scared of a little needle. Scared enough to rip your arm off if you come near me with that thing. Here we go. You okay, Max? Yeah. There you go. Let's play ball. Oh, me, I'm late. I'm late, I'm late for an very important date. There's no time to say hello and goodbye, I'm late, I'm late, I'm. Hello? What, you? You must work in the engine room? Yeah, I overslept through my watch, and now I'm, I. Oh, I get it! You must be with that new group we're supposed to keep an eye on. I have to tell you, you're not the friendliest blokes we've ever had on board. You're not gluten free, are ya? Because, I read, if you don't get enough gluten, you lose your communication skills. Just saying. No offense. No offense. I meant no... If it's agreeable with you, I think I'm just gonna go back the, uh, same way. Argh! You don't look so good. You've known me a long time; was I ever sick? You mean physically or mentally? Sick. Like the flu? Well, I don't know where you're going with this, but I'll play. Sick? Let me see. No, can't see I remember you ever being sick. Wait! What about that time when you were away for a few months? That wasn't physical, Dell. The worst time was at night. I could hear the other inmates crying, screaming. They finally settled on electric shock treatments for me. I think I scream louder than anyone. Max. I'm sorry. Let's just say, if I have to do electrical work on the house, I don't have to turn off the power. There's an infection! Go back to the engine room. And don't try to scare anyone. Now how did they know that? Huh? - Stake her, Dell! - I'm trying! Stake her! Stake her! Dell, stab her heart, not body. Do it! Sorry, my aim was meant to be true. Their weakness, it's the heart. How did you know? Lucky guess. Make sure we don't get separated, Dell. I didn't know you cared so much. Now who's that? They call me Mr. Witz. - Who? - What, are we rat hunting? There's an infection. And you are disease control? Stay in your cabin. Lock the door. You know it costs absolutely nothing to be civil. That is so lacking in today's society. Stay in your cabin, pretty please? Well, if you put it that way. My mom called a couple days ago. She asked how you were. Did you tell her I met someone? Well, I hate to break it to you, Max, but Sarra's, Sarra's not gonna be like she was. She's, she's not like us now. And don't shoot the messenger. I remember my first dog. She was my best friend, my only friend. And when she started limping, my uncle had her put down. It was probably only a sprain. Well, Sarra's not a pet. And I'm not my uncle. Ugh! Ah! Ugh! A horse. A horse, a kingdom for a horse. It's you again. Didn't get enough of me last time, did ya? Come on and get me then. Come on and get me! There you go and freeze. What's the matter, cat got your tongue? This will never work. O ye of little faith. This will work. Let's do this. How do you even know they like raw meat? I saw the massacre in the cafeteria. Trust me, they like meat, and they like it raw. How much do you think we can get for a live one? The sky's the limit. If that doc won't pay, maybe we can sell it to the circus. I like the elephants. And the trapeze girls. They're always so pretty. Shh. When that chain moves, we jerk it with all our might. And then we hook that sucker. Hey, where did you guys find the meat? The frozen storage locker. And it's not infected? Nope. Hey, wanna join us for dinner? Sure. Love to. Oh yeah. Tell me again, Dell. Dell? Max. What part of don't get separated do you know not understand? I thought I heard something. Get outta there, Dell. Wait, come back! Run! Have I ever been sick? Of course you have. All my boys get sick now and then. When? When was I sick? What are you going on about? When? Max, I'm your mother, of course I know if you been sick or not. When? Ugh. Now don't be silly. Everyone gets sick. Everyone gets ill, Max. Everyone except you. Max! Max! Get up and fight, Max! Let me at 'em. Bite me. Stake this. Love bites. Happy hunting. Let's burn this mother down. Somebody's gonna die tonight. I'm feelin' a little batty. This ain't hopscotch, Pablo. I hate this boat. Ship. Whatever. Maybe we're here for a reason, Dell. I know I am. I'm most wanted wherever I am. In great demand am I. You're not going all spiritual on me, are ya? What would you do if you knew you were about to die? We're not gonna die, Max. What would you do? Well, I'd like my mom to know. She worries about me all the time, and I'd want her to know that she didn't have to worry anymore. About me, I mean. I'd want that for her. That sounds a little like Sarra. I'll be back. What? You need me, Max. Make sure that room is ready for Sarra. Oh, who's gonna have your back. You always have and you always will, Dell. Max said he's coming back with Sarra. And just how's he planning to do that? He didn't say, but he wants you to have this room ready. I see. You know, there's something odd about your friend there. His blood is very unique. Very, very unique. I think he needs to prepare for a profuse amount of testing when he gets back. You're dreamin', doc. He just wants to get his girlfriend back. Ah, true love, is it? Well, I think your friend Max is flying a bit too close to the sun. And if he's not extremely careful, he's going to get burned. Badly burned. Well, what's this thing want with Sarra? Well, I finally confirmed my initial thought. The oldest known rule in the universe: propagation. Now you're just being disgusting, doc. Well, be that as it may, I do wish Max every success in bringing Sarra back here. But I fear- It's too late for her? She's infected. Max is chasing an illusion of what once was. He's hoping that she's still the same. Maybe. But sometimes, doc, sometimes all you have is hope. Argh! Ugh! I don't see how that is being productive. Yours is not to wonder why. I'm going to the head. I'll log it into our books. By the way, I think your dead rat is breathing. Head this ship home, captain. You don't have to tell an old salt like me more than once, matey. No sign yet. Looks like your fountain of youth will have to wait a bit longer, doc. Hey, do you know why Bach had so many kids? Huh-uh. He didn't have any stops on his organs. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Steak time! Sweet dreams, doc. I can't believe you caught her with a net. You really think this is gonna work? I don't know, but I can't live without her, Dell. I don't know, Max. You still love me, Max? Max! Stop biting me. You don't look so good. I feel great. Do you still believe in love at for sight? More than ever. So now I'm all yours, Max. I'm all yours. Looks like you're in the wrong town, stranger. Funny, I was gonna say the same thing about you. Maybe it ain't hearin' me? Oh, I heard you. I just don't care. But there's three of us. You kicked the wrong dog. Giddy up. Yee-haw. I like that hat. The problem you have is that the devil lives in my gun. Don't get comfortable, amigo, you're not gonna be here that long.
