HARD PAINT "Did he cum already?“" "Yes. Then fell asleep and forgot the camera was on." "When is his next show?" "Someone please break into his bedroom." "Show us more, NeonBoy." MarriedVoyeur: "He is my favorite perfomer.“ MarriedVoyeur: "I've been watching him for months." Marriedvoyeur: "I wish I could meet him." PART 1 LUIZA I have a hearing at 4:30. ID. Pedro! I got stuck at work. Go ahead. Wait a second. Mr. Pedro, are you still in touch with the victim? I dropped out of college. Dropped out? I got kicked out. Do you have an employment contract? I work here and there. On what? On whatever comes up. And who do you live with at the moment? Do you live with your parents? Only with my sister. My mother died when I was little. I don't know where my dad is. Did your sister come with you today? Yes, over there. And with her, do you get along? Very. Mr. Pedro, are there moments when it seems that you are going to lose control? That it seems difficult to interact with people, with certain situations? No. Your former colleagues described you as “a shy and antisocial person, unable to make friends... Do you agree with that? It's their opinion. What? I'm working. Your music is too loud. They're going to call me any moment now, from Salvador. I'll leave these boxes here with stuff I don't want to get lost. Why don't you take it with you? I can't, there is a baggage allowance, Pedro. And I'm gonna have new things there. It will clutter the bedroom floor, Luiza. Then when you move your things to my bedroom, you can move these to yours... and leave them there. Done. And what about this picture that showed up in my bag? Do you remember that day? Yes. On the beach, right? Grandma took us. Do you remember a kid who was picking on me, chasing me to the sea? It took me a while to understand it wasn't a joke. So... take it with you. Guys, someone paid for a private show. So I'm going to disconnect here... but I'll be back Thursday, okay? Incoming call MarriedVoyeur. Hi, MarriedVoyeur. Hi, NeonBoy. Are you laughing at me? No... It's just that your voice isn't what I imagined. This private show thing is weird. No one was going to pay for more. They always pay. Only a few people were watching you today. You have had less and less audience. Let me see more of your body. Move back a bit. It's so good to know that I'm the only one watching you. Today I am all yours. Don't you wish it was always like this? Just you and me? Of course. We could meet. I'm also from Porto Alegre. I don't go out with users from the website. I can take care of you. Hug you. Kiss you. Every night. Then you wouldn't have those sad eyes anymore. Go to the back. Now take off your underwear. Turn off the light. Start touching yourself. It's this one. Oh, you need to leave a security deposit of 50 for the barrel. Ten missing. That's it. What about the receipt? The barrel is the receipt. Return the barrel and I'll give you back the 50. Hold it, son. I know who you are. Luiza's brother? And you? Sérgio. Newsroom colleague. Well, now former-colleague, right? Where can I get some vodka? Your sister is very loved, right? Well, just look at all the people who came to say goodbye. A lot of women, huh? Did the trial verdict come out yet? No. The sentence comes out in three months. Luiza was worried that day. She called me crying... she didn't want to go to the newsroom. At least she looks happy now, right? She didn't want to stay here. So I got that job for her in Salvador. You two are a very similar, eh? The energy is a bit different. - Ice? - Sure. Pedro... we don't always agree with even/thing around us, man. We don't have to agree. But hey, we live in a society and it doesn't change from one moment to another. We have to be patient and wait for the right time to act. That was our first time at the beach. Oh, how lovely. So tiny. I love this picture. So skinny. Pedro! Can you turn the music down? What? The music over there. Can you turn it down? There are people trying to sleep. Can't you hear me? If that party continues, you'll get a fine. Understood? I'm warning you. I'm going to Bahia, my dear. I left to Bahia, my dear. I left to Bahia, my dear. I'm moving to Bahia, my dear. What happened to the faucet? When I saw it, it was broken. Remember the view when we came to live here? You could see so much more. Everyone leaves this town. TO SELL Who will live in those apartments? TO RENT I didn't get along with that coffee-maker. It tastes burnt. I like it. Do you want me to go to the airport with you? I'm going to get there and board right away. You would just waste money having to get back. How many hours flying? There is a layover in S50 Paulo. It will take about 9 hours total. That's a long time. It's on the other side of the country. And the performances? It's been getting less and less viewers. Maybe it's time to change jobs. Joio told me about a guy from Porto Alegre... who is copying you with the paint thing. What do you mean? He must be stealing your audience. He sent me a print screen. I came up with neon before. No one cares who did first, Pedro. I'll take care of this. Promise me something? You're going to go out every day. Even if it's just for a walk. 5 minutes. Promise? I'm sorry I left this faucet mess for you to solve. I'll take a look now and fix it. You should call someone. You won't figure it out by yourself. SET COUNTDOWN NeonBoy? B0Y25? That too. - But my name is Leo. - Pedro. Sorry, I'm late. You are. I bought some beer. Do you want to drink something? I don't drink during performances. Do you live alone? Yes. What do you do for a living? I work on the website. It's been a year. You don't have any other occupation? D0 you? I'm a dancer. I'm only doing this because I applied for a scholarship in Buenos Aires. To study dance. So I'm saving money for the trip. Are you going for sure? It's not certain... but I'm good. My dream is to travel the world teaching dance classes. Spending some time in each place. Did you start painting yourself after seeing my performance? No. I've been doing this since I started. It's my trademark. There's no room for both of us to do this. I'm doing fine. I didn't even know about you until you reached out to me. The website records even/one who watches us. I know you've watched almost all my latest performances. I thought it was pretty. The way you could glow on the screen. NeonBoy is the most important thing I have. I won't let anyone put him at risk. Don't paint yourself anymore, unless you are with me. And one more thing. Boy25 is a terrible nickname. Why do you paint yourself? That's enough for 10 tokens. Turn off the light over there. Don't do that. I forgot my paint set. Wow. You have so many colors. The white one is toothpaste. Be careful where you put it on. They are asking how we met. So, we swim at the same club. But we didn't talk to each other. Until one day, when he left the dressing room first and I left soon after... And I felt something bothering my foot... and it was a note he had put inside my sneakers with his name on it. Did that happen to you? I don't even know how to swim. Sit on the bed. Show your feet. Always show your feet. Don't do anything for free and remember: They only stay if they find us interesting. Hello? Hello? Luiza? No, she doesn't live here anymore. It's been a few days already. I don't have her new number. PART 2 LEO There's some left here. So, when's our next one? It was only this time. I can't risk losing my audience. Okay And what are we going to do about the money? When it gets into my account, I'll let you know. It's a little dirty over there in the back. Pedro? YES? Don't you remember me? We were neighbors. I'm Julio's mom, he was your classmate. Oh, of course. I almost didn't recognize you, but your face hasn't changed a bit. It reminds me of your mother. How is Julio doing? Julio is fine. He's about to graduate from law school. He wants to be a police chief. It makes sense that he wants to be a police chief. And you guys? Luiza lives in Salvador, she's a journalist. Wow. You guys used to be glued together. What about you? I was studying chemistry, but I stopped. Oh yeah, I heard about that. That what? That you were studying chemistry. Well... I have to go. Good seeing you. Pedro... good luck. Yes, tonight I'll be performing alone. No idea when we will do another show together. If no one else is going to pay for something more... I'm going to end the show now. I'll be on again on Thursday. Hey. Just a second. Here's 167. I took 20 off, for the paint. Can I have some water? So, did you perform today? Uhm. And how was it? It was good. Cool. You are going to have competition for longer. What do you mean? I'm not going to travel anymore. A colleague of mine got the scholarship. What a pity. At dawn, moving the bed... from side to side. Pushing the closet. And how are things for the trip? Well, I haven't packed yet. Not yet? Are you crazy? No, I haven't even decided what to do with all my stuff. New house, new life, new country. Oh, yeah. Forget this city. Go away. I don't know. We are unforgettable. Oh no, it's the city and not you guys. If there's one thing I would like to see is you speaking Spanish. I would also like that. But it's so similar to Portuguese and my work is physical. This city feels like a purgatory. Your jacket is really pretty. It belonged to my mom. What about you? Are you from Porto Alegre? Yes. Have you always lived here? Yes. What's your story? What story? I don't know, I've never seen you before. What's your story? Were you raised by parents, never left home? Were you in a coma, woke up this morning and decided to come here? I don't really like to go out. Are you single? Yes. Let's dance? - Let's go? - Yeah. Aren't you going to dance? I don't dance. What do you mean you don't dance? And on the webcam? I distract them with the paint. Do it like this. Feel the rhythm of the music. Now move your arms... as if you were performing. Pedro. Pedro, wait. Calm down, man, not even a hello? How are you? Won't you go back to college? Oh no, he was kicked out, right? That party is great. Gabriel wanted to stop by, but you know how it is. He gets kind of paranoid when people look at him. Pedro... ...you owe us an eye. Leo! Leo! It's over, let's go. As usual the police showed up and shut down the party. Is everyone okay? I guess so. Igor had a lot of MDMA. But he managed to get rid of it during the confusion. Thank you for keeping me company today. It was hard to look at Ana so happy for something I wanted so badly. Specially knowing that I'm going to be stuck here. At least you have a good group of friends. You didn't say anything all night, I thought you didn't like them. I don't think I've ever talked this much. But for someone who never leaves the house, you can fight. It wasn't my first time. Now I understand your punk rock look. I had never been in a fight before. But I've dealt with people like that all my life. Since my childhood. At school. The car that drives by on the street. When you get on the bus. There's something about the way they look at you. I thought one day that would stop. It doesn't. Never. They gradually make you feel like shit. Until you lose hope. I remember a story that happened here in Porto Alegre. About a year ago. A shy guy, reclusive. Didn't talk much to people, you know? Specially because most of his classmates were jerks. Probably not all of them. But you just need two or three and then the others don't do nothing and the nightmare is set. I think it came to a point that the boy thought he had only two options. To drop out of college... and give up. Or to try to fit in. So he went to a party. I think it was at the end of the academic semester. The nightclub was crowded. Everyone dancing. And the boy had no fucking idea what he was doing there. And people drink, right? Some people become nicer... they let loose. But some turn into complete assholes. Then a classmate stopped by his side. Probably said a thousand things in his ear. While everyone was dancing to the music. Nothing he had never heard before. That was part of his existence. But that night he decided he wouldn't take it anymore. As I recall the story, he grabbed his house key... put it between his fingers... and punched the guy's face. But the key ended up piercing his eye... and the classmate was blinded. And people shouted: "Violence!" "Violence!" And they shared the photo of the boy. That now was a criminal. And when I saw that picture... I just wish I could be there that night... to wipe off the blood on his face. Leo? Hey. Would you like something to eat? No, I'm late. I have a lot to do. I borrowed your T-shirt. I'll shut the front door, ok? 0k. COUNTDOWN Is he bothering you? I think he likes you. If I don't walk him a couple of times a day at least, he won't leave me alone. Small apartment, you know? He seems thirsty. Yeah, I give him water in a building over there. You're always here, right? But you stay only for a few minutes then you leave. Yeah, I just come to get some sun. Are these lights for a party? They don't illuminate well. It's a gift. I was waiting for you at the beginning of the month. It took me a while to get the money. But it's here. The next rent is due soon. I know. There will be an adjustment. There will be an adjustment. Can't you delay the adjustment for a few months? The fine from your sister's party remains unpaid after two months. You have to take care of it. I'll figure it out. Have you ever had a serious relationship? Yes. Who was it? Some guy I met at a party. How was it? It lasted three years. Do you miss him? We broke up some time ago... but we text from time to time to see if the other one is okay. Why did it end? That same scholarship that I lost now, I got it three years ago. But I decided to stay... he couldn't go with me. And it was awful. And it was awful. Pedro... if you feel the trial will take a bad turn, leave. Go away. Don't come back. Leave whoever you have here. See you Thursday. Bye. The best scenario is to get a short sentence... and then get it suspended. For example, every three months you would have to appear in court. If not, the sentence could be imprisonment... and then you will have to be in jail for some time. We are claiming that your action was in virtue of a relevant moral value... and that is why we are asking for a reduced sentence. Which would be ideal. But this judge is quite conservative... and could consider that the circumstance is an aggravating factor... if she understands that you acted motivated by a futile reason. That is why it is very important to make it clear to the judge... that you are sorry about the assault. What? To show her that you wouldn't do it again. You are sorry, aren't you? He deserved it. He made my life a living hell... and I'm here paying for it. You blinded someone's eye, Pedro. And if I had killed myself... because of his bullying, would he be in this situation? Never say that in court. Because you are a primary defendant, she is likely to let you serve your sentence in freedom. Then you won't have to be in prison... but you can't say that. I suggest you get a haircut... dress up well... and you need to bring your sister again. My sister doesn't live here anymore. And is there anyone else in your family? My grandmother. But she can't know. Having a family member present sensitizes the judge. It shows that you haven't been abandoned, you know? Are you still living alone? For now, yes. People are sleeping. I better go. Why? I can't. Pedro, you came all the way here. Now stay. I need to sleep at home. Pedro, I would love it if you stayed. Really? Okay. But I need to clean my room, it's a mess. Stay here. Drink your beer. I'll be right back. Leo is in his bedroom. And who are you? I'm Pedro. Pedro. I'm finally meeting you. I'm Morgana. Leo's sister. My pleasure. I'm gonna make tea. Do you want some? No, thank you. We're going to bed soon. So jealous. I'm studying. I have a test tomorrow. - What do you study? - Geography. I'm almost graduating. Cool. Leo told me you work with paint, something like that. Yeah. Something like that. Have you met the rest of the guys yet? Nice to meet you. I'm Mauro. Pedro. Hi, I'm Monica. The house is a mess because there is a lot of people, but feel at home. The house is yours. Make yourself comfortable. Do you want a beer? No, thank you. How was the party? It was really good. And go down to the right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. And right. Left. Go up. Stay. You don't have to look up, otherwise you will strangle yourself. There. Show your shoulder. Show your neck. Show your neck. Show your neck. Lower that shoulder. You are missing some hip movement. Stay up there. Right. Stay there. Go. Go through the side. No, again. Here. There is no fluidity, guys. From here it goes up. You're stopping. You're stopping. Again, that same thing as usual. Stay. Stay, Leo. Control. And now, go. With your head. Go down. Up there. Up there. UP, UP, UP- Stay. I want to see you stay." Stay. Stay. Stay. I'm saying stay, so stay. Again. Are the rehearsals always this intense? Yes. But it's worse today. I think Igor is trying to take his anger out on Leo. Why? Because he said he's leaving the group. He said he needed some time, that he wanted to focus on other things. I didn't quite get it, I thought you would know. What about Ana? How are things in Buenos Aires? She's great. We broke up over Skype. Sorry, Paula. It's ok. She's there in a new place and I'm here surrounded by the same places we used to be in. And every time I try to go somewhere different, people look at me from head to toe. But fuck it. My grandmother used to say that downtown Porto Alegre will disappear someday. Because it's an embanked area. The water used to take over everything. So they embanked with sand... and now the buildings sink a little bit every year. Until one day everything will be buried. Shit. The internet crashed. I'm going to reboot the modem. My trial is in a month. Are you cool? I need you to go with me. Pedro, I would do anything for you. Truly. I really want you to get out of this. But I won't be able to go to the trial with you. A scholarship became available and I was called. You are going to move to Argentina. No. The company in Argentina is full. I'm going to Berlin. I know it's kind of out of the blue. But I can't miss this. This job of ours here won't last much longer. Of course. It's the opportunity of your life. Leo, I'm very happy for you. Truly. Good. I've been meaning to tell you this for a while. Since when have you known? A couple of weeks. When do you leave? Twenty days. It's back on. What were we going to do? Dance? No, we just did that. Right. Don't you think we should cancel the show today? Leo, I'm gonna need that money. "I had paid for the next goal." "Naked wrestling." Enough. Let me go. Don't use neon anymore. I came up with it, and I need it. Yeah, you really need it. You are far less interesting without it. "Who paid for this shit?“ "What happened there?" "I hope Boy25 Wins." "Is he gone?“ "What a jerk you are." "I'm outta here." "Skype anyone?" PART 3 NEONBOY The plumbing in this house is rotten. I washed a glass and couldn't close the faucet. You need to stanch it with a cloth. I'll call someone to come fix it. This building is very old. Soon something else will break. I like it here. It's cheap. There is a lot of people around. It messes things up. You are too skinny. You are locked up all day painting yourself. It must be bad for you. It's not toxic. That's what you think. Have you been leaving the house? Not much. Have you? Not much. But at your age it's good. Otherwise you will grow old... and not have anything to reminisce about. Have you been feeling mostly happy or mostly sad? Mostly sad. I'm ok, MarriedVoyeur. I just need some company today. "Where's the other one?" "Are you alone? I prefer couples.“ MarriedVoyeur: What happened, NeonBoy? Hugecarl: Won't you be naked? No, guys. I don't think I can have a hard on. MarriedVoyeur: If there's anything I can do to help. Hello? Hi, NeonBoy. MarriedVoyeur? You look really handsome today. Are you here already? I'm looking at you. Come over here, then. No. I'd rather just look at you. If I meet you, the magic may go away. I need to talk to someone. It's strange seeing you in person. Please, MarriedVoyeur. You look stronger on the webcam. Hey... one more please. And another glass. Thank you. So? Did you like it? Uhum. So... we would perform three or four times a week. I run the show. I already have experience and an interested audience that will pay well. How much do you make a night? It depends. 100. 150. Nice. Today was 180. What? 180 for the date. What date? This wasn't free. Why didn't you say so at the bar? Man... I do this for money. I can't just let it go. My bad if I didn't make it clear. Or I did and you forgot. You drank a bit, it confuses us. Anyway, you can get the money, right? Do you have a credit card with you? I just came with the bus fare. You make 100 reais a night and you came only with the bus fare. Cool. We'll go to your house... grab the card and go to the bank. I'm not in a hurry. I'll be back in a bit. Cool. I didn't mean to wake you up. I was trying to fix the faucet. What is that? It's nothing. A band-aid can handle it. Are you leaving already? I need to go back home. Do you want to eat something before you go? I'll eat on the road. They came over to collect the rent. Do you have money to pay? I do. I just forgot. Is this paint the kind that shines in the dark? Yes. I'll clean it now. If it makes you happy, leave it. Do you have someone who makes you happy? You. No. I mean someone who makes you shine like the paint? I did. But he is leaving tomorrow. Pedro. I thought you weren't coming. I just came to bring you this gift. My friends are leaving. I'm going to say goodbye to them. I'll be right back, okay? Okay, let me see what's in here. In case you need money there. They're used. They are the ones I had at home. I won't need them anymore. You never needed it. Are you looking forward to the trip? Yes. So much. I have butterflies in my stomach. It's horrible to say goodbye to people. Seriously, I think I've cried about ten litres today. I didn't think it would hurt so much. But I'm trying to think about other things. To focus on how it's going to be there. I don't know how to speak German. But I'll have to manage. At least I'm already in touch with a colleague there... and she offered to pick me up at the airport. Super sweet. You two will get along. How do you know? My mother was psychic. Can you see your future? I'm trying not to think about it. Just want to enjoy tonight. There's one more thing here. For you to put on your wall. I will. And you will see it when you come visit me. I'm exhausted. I haven't slept well in days. I barely slept last night. I have to be at the airport in a little bit. But I asked my sister, she'll bring my bags there. Let's lie down for a bit? Let's pretend this night will last ten more hours. And when it's over... everything will be as we'd like.
