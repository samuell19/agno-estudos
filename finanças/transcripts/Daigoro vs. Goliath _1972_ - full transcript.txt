Toho Co., Ltd. Tsubaraya Productions ~10th Anniversary Piece~ One sunny day... Hey there! We meet again, right? We begin a new episode of "Amazing Inventions"! Introducing today's guest! Uncle, good luck! For the sake of Daigoro, a hungry monster! Before demonstrating this invention, please, briefly tell us about it. What's it called? Aerobike. Aerobike. I'm afraid I can't hear you! Aerobike! This is an Aerobike! Uncle, good luck! Good luck! Tell me, what will you spend your money on? Food for Daigoro! Daigoro? "Help save Daigoro!" Hey! Get started. Okay. Sorry, Daigoro. Budget problems have left us with less food for you. Sorry. Please understand, Daigoro. I'm afraid you’ll have to get by with water alone today. It just can't be helped. You've gotten too big! Okay, for the sake of the hungry monster... let's kick off the game! STRUGGLE OF THE MONSTERS: DAIGORO VS. GOLIATH Will it fly? Will it fly? Will he ever take off? If he holds out in the air for a minute, he will win two million! Let's find out! "Awakened by the roar of the wind..." "He saw a shooting star in the sky" "The hungry monster, Daigoro..." "The time to fight will come one day" "Hang in there, Daigoro! Hang in there, Daigoro!" "Don't give up and keep striving!" "Hang in there, Daigoro! Hang in there, Daigoro!" "The time has come to test your strength" "Holding his breath to the splash of waves" "It reminds him of the waves from home" "You lost your mom, Daigoro..." "The time to fight will come one day" Gone... Sorry! Make way! Hey, watch out mister! Excuse me! Sorry! He's airborne, but... Not good? Not good? A fail? It ain't good, uncle! My bad. I'm coming down. One, two... Come, Taro. We have a lot to do. My sister is having another marriage interview tomorrow. Let's not smear my reputation now! "Another marriage interview"... Hopefully this one will work out. What do you mean by "this one"? "You have an interesting uncle..." And then I'm always ghosted. Hey, are you busy? Busy. What a rude woman! Hello! Well? Are you okay, buddy? Fine! It’s good that you feel pain! You know, when something hurts, it means that the nerves work great! Wow! So you're alive, right? It’s much worse when nothing hurts at all. Then you would have your hand pulled out of your shoulder! But all is well, buddy! So, what’s wrong with your leg? We'll see! Alright, here we go! - Leave him alone! - Ouch! That hurts! Sorry... Who is this guy? What do you think you're doing? Don't you see? I'm checking his nerves. No, thanks. That's the doctor’s job. And who are you anyway? His friend? "His friend?" you say! Come on! Have you forgotten me? How many days have passed, I wonder. You had some nice fish delivered and... I dropped in at yours for a drink. A drink? Yes, and you said then that I was impudent, as one friend of your husband. "Husband"?! But at the same time handsome! "Handsome"? Hachi, man, your wife is heartless! I've already been forgotten! "Your... wife"? Who the hell are you?! I have a hunch you're called Kuma (bear) or Oni (demon). That's right. I'm Kumagoro Onizawa. Kuma? Where've you been? Dumbass! I mixed up... Fool. Sorry to be rude to you and your husband. I am not his wife! I'm his niece... Taro! Time to go home! "DAIGORO! NO BUDGET LEFT" Man, the heat today! Maybe he's now in a growing phase... He's been getting bigger rapidly these days. 50-60 kilograms of food per day is clearly not enough for him. Children send for him 50-100 yen per day, but this is actually pennies. That's why we asked the Ministry of Environmental Health for support. Yeah yeah... But you know, judging by his mother's size, he'll grow up to be at least a few dozen meters long, and he'll be a few hundred tons. You're free to try and educate him, but he doesn't look very smart. It'd be lucky if he dies from a disease, using poison isn't what we want here. It's alright, he's sound asleep now. I don't want to piss him off. Well, anyways, suppressing his growth is the best idea. You know, and as long as he is within this size, he can be your sightseeing resource. Well? Okay. If you teach him to Hula Dance, it can be this island's speciality. Daigoro! It's a friend! Yes! Friend! I am your... Friend! Friend! Don't surprise me. He's not living here for fun at all. He has no choice. It's been six years since then... If that atomic submarine hadn’t exploded... His mother, sleeping underground several thousand meters underwater... wouldn't have been awakened. Perhaps they called him Daigoro and decided to raise him to atone for his guilt. I think Daigoro... would continue to sleep with his mother... if he knew the siuation he was in. I was a keeper of calves and goats at a zoo, and I was assigned to take care of Daigoro. I don’t know if I can handle it... Don’t worry. Just think of it as a large pig. A pig you say...? Excuse me! So, do you want some milk? Well done... Hey, stop it! Enough! Daigoro! - Let go! Let go! - Daigoro! Let him go! Quiet place, right? Yeah. Hey, don't bother me! I'm going home! Hey, wait! Hey... What are you hinting at? He's not hinting at anything. He's just hungry. Save Daigoro! If you refuse to purchase one fighter, Daigoro can live for another three years. Don't you feel sorry for Daigoro, who is not allowed to grow normally? Such a peaceful animal... He is not an animal, he is a monster! - Monsters should live freely... - Well, no! We don't want our taxes to go to monster food! I understand... Therefore, please make a donation... Move, move, move! Out the way! Move it! Hey, I'm here now! So... Mic-one-check... You say: taxes, taxes! Do you even pay them, these taxes? Do you pay them yourself? Of course! Don't you know that I am the great carpenter Kumagoro? Remember this! Listen, you can go about being carefree while eating plenty of food everyday. But Kumagoro... - Daigoro. - Got it. That Daigoro is always starved, you cheap bastards! Who are you to call us "cheap"? What? Say it to my face if you've got something to say! You bastard! Is it you who's trying me? Bring it on, you bastards! Son of a... Go ahead! Finish me off now! "Although I am walking on the path of justice..." Sorry. I am really sorry. I did not want to bring you any trouble. I am always like that. I wonder why I always spoil everything? I'm the same as you, Kuma. Despite my age, I am still financially dependent on my father. So I want to do something for Daigoro myself. That's just... Poor Daigoro. Today, he will again have to fall asleep on an empty stomach. Okay... I'll quit drinking. I’m giving up drinking, and the money saved will go to food for Daigoro. Hey, Daigoro! See, I promised! Okay. Next time I will invent something good. Right, Taro? Yes! You will definitely win a prize in the contest "Amazing Inventions"! Two million! It's a lot! "Gubazu, Zuzubire, Zubire, fall asleep..." "Until the sun rises above the sea" "Gubazu, Zuzubire, Zubire, fall asleep..." "May you dream of your favorite food" "Sleep tight..." "Zubire, Zubire, Zubire, Daigoro..." Excuse me! Eh? Daigoro is forced to starve due to no more budget. Able to spare some money for him? Spare money? No no. I don’t do donations. Mr. Manager! Something needs to be given to be these children. "Manager"? Oh, excuse me. President? President? No way... You be should be generous and donate some! Thank you, auntie! Auntie? Ten yen! Hey, everyone! Everyone? The president is giving out money! Thank you! It's not funny! Help! Help me! It's fine! Hey! This way. Welcome. In. How cool! Two million? Two million... Right! Magic shoes! Magic shoes! Magical! Put on these red shoes. They are very light. Light! Light! Light! Try walking. Go faster. Give it a try. Faster. Go faster. Like this! Forward! One, two... Good luck Hello! Damn, we also have cars. Jump up. They are light. Very light. Like a feather. Yes. Like a feather... Feather... Stop right there! Uncle. Are you inventing something again? Do what you want, just no flying around! I don’t want any funerals here. Dinner time! Five o'clock. That's behind. Taro, let's go. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! "If a samurai is destined to chop enemies..." It's so hot, this sun is being an ass! Welcome! Hey, manager, the usual! Coming up! Oh no! Mi-chan! Another bottle? Okay! "If a samurai is destined to cut enemies..." "Why can't I cut the bonds of love..." I can't. I just can't. What's the matter with you, Kuma? Not for Kumagoro. This is for Daigoro. See you 'round. Good? Hey, Kuma! Not a fair trade... What can I do with this now? "The decision made to reduce Daigoro's size." "In order to reduce food costs for Daigoro, they will give him Anti-Growth so that it grows more slowly." Okay... I'll do it today. Two million are at stake. We can handle it! So... This part. - I'll introduce you to my uncle. - Sure. Uncle? Ultraman! Welcome. Well, I'm Eda. This is my uncle... You stupid jerk! Who's winning today? Well... I've got no clue. "Nakano Optics" Have you been dreaming again? Get your ass back to sleep! "Anti-Growth, 20,000 cm3" Sorry... Saito. No. No. I can't do it. I can't. He's not going to die. We're just suppressing his growth. But... But after all... Would you do this to him if he was your son? Why are you bothering to come out with this now? As an official of the Ministry of Health and the Environment, I am ordering... Daigoro to be given Anti-Growth. Got it, Saito? I can't... OK OK. I understand. Hello! You and I are friends! Friends! You and I are friends! Daigoro! Eat it! Please eat! Listen, Daigoro! This is what's going to keep you alive! You and I are friends! Daigoro! Daigoro! Good, Daigoro! Well done! Yes, well done! Daigoro... Damn it! "At that moment, Daigoro looked like that..." "as if he understood what the consequences would be," "with readiness..." "with readiness..." "he ate food with the Anti-Growth." Damn! Hey! How's you! Hachi? Is that you? Not very polite! Welcome, Hachigoro! And you, as always, are polite! Decided to drop in with us with a bottle of sake? Well, this is not the best sake exactly! When I was in the hospital you took good care of me. Many thanks. It's my pleasure. You know, he's been acting a little strange lately. He doesn't drink at all these days. And today got upset and said that some friend "Daigoro" fell ill. Daigoro? Never heard of such a guy. Kuma, from which clan is this Daigoro? You just don't get it. What are you talking about? That's what the social interface is! Interface? Everything's buttoned up. Why doesn’t anyone understand anything? Quit whining. Don't worry. Probably the weather affects him that way. It's unsettled lately, hasn't it? Yesterday it was hot as hell! I so wanted to plunge into cold water! But today is cool, right? - In fact, it has become colder. - Yes. I'll bring some hot tea. I'll appreciate it. Everyone eats and eats! And become fat like swine. Bastards. What? Who's the fat one here? You're here as fat as a hog! What's wrong with you? Why are you so upset? Man, sometimes it won't hurt to read the newspapers. Is Japan an economic giant? And at the same time reluctant to give money to feed one animal? Look here! The sight of Daigoro's sad face. Poor thing. Humans killed his mother, and now they try to drug him... to keep him small. What? Are you talking about this monster fatty? What? You don't have any sympathy? Well, I do truly feel sorry for him. So show your feelings! So will you continue to drink and do nothing? I do... I was going to... What's wrong with you? I am going to donate some money for Daigoro, and for this I quit drinking. Look at the piggy bank... What? Is this your doing?! I... bought this. What is this? You are the wife of a carpenter! Damn it! Well, now I'm diving straight in! Wait, that's not...! What a crappy sake! This isn't sake! It's Tatsunoko hot spring water! Hot spring? Yes. They say that if she wash herself, her skin will be whiter than silk. I wanted to give it to your wife. Scrape out of my business! You don't have to mind if my wife's face is white or black! - Just accept the gift, bastard! - What did I catch you saying? That coward can run fast! "Amazing Inventions! Win two million yen!" The next invention is the "Instant Rain Rocket." If it rains three minutes after the launch, the participant will win two million yen. Taro, it'll be all okay? He said that this time he was sure of success. Yes. Yes. - 10 seconds to start. - What? - 10 Seconds! - Yes. Everything is ready. Good. Here! There'll be no rain. But... We'll never get a shower out of this. Who'd really expect this junk to make it rain? What a joke. Three, two, one, fire! Snow! How strange... Raindrops are moisture vapor in clouds... which then concentrate around ice crystals... They won’t become snow without... Uncle, what are you babbling on about? This is real snow! Look around you! It's not raining, but... Okay? You said okay? Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Uncle. Close it, soon. Finally he won! An amazing invention! Bravo! Congratulations! See you in a week! Thanks. Many thanks! Thanks! When will the snow stop? Who knows... Who knows? Don't kid about. Bringing snow in this season... We're not responsible for all this, because we were counting on rain. It's cold... Stop it before serious problems begin. I apologize. Uncle, why did it snow? I don't know. Just a coincidence. My rocket has nothing to do with it. We'd better just accept it. Though, there is a moral issue. Alright, enough talk! We better buy Daigoro some food! Uncle. Rain! "Tokyo Municipal Biological Laboratory - Gorjima Division" What's up with this weather? And they told me that on this island it doesn’t snow even in winter... Yes, Saito? Hey, stop being stubborn! Lend us your help here. I'm not so good at shouting this: "Friends! Friends!" I feel like Tarzan. By the way... he always rumbles when he sees me. Like he wants to tell me something. All this is strange. "Wooh", like that? Yeah. Rather something like that. Can you get more accurate? Sure. Or like that? Gestures don't matter. Quit it! You can go and check it yourself! What's this all about? I understood. He's probably talking about the sky. The sky? Daigoro, what's the matter? He's gotten mad! Daigoro's instincts are awakening! Now he will destroy everything! No! He is looking at the sea! There's something in the sea! What are you talking about? - Do any of you have a tranquilizer? - Yes! Get ready to shoot Daigoro! Let's put him to sleep before he does anything! Mr. Suzuki, you were mistaken! Daigoro... Saito, don’t forget that Daigoro is a monster! The abnormal weather could get his instincts to act up! He'd be unstoppable! Daigoro! Mr. Suzuki, look! Look over there! So it was snowing because of this monster? It's got a frigid look, hasn't it? Watch out, Saito! Daigoro! Hold on! It's nothing! It's nothing! He can’t fight at all. That's because the poor thing's hungry. Don't you see? He's fighting for us! Daigoro! Daigoro! Daigoro! Daigoro! Daigoro! "Daigoro Humanitarian Aid" Daigoro! "Daigoro Relief Society" We got you food! Yeah, the monster was pretty fierce. After defeating Daigoro, he appeared off the coast by the seaside industrial zone, destroyed it and returned back to the sea. He wouldn't lose if he got to eat! Right, uncle? Yes... You called a doctor? I am a doctor. I'm the only doctor on this island. We don't need a horse doctor. Why didn’t they call a human doctor? I say, I'm the only doctor. And what about his pulse? Very bad... Did you give him injections? I've tried. But the patient is too big. You mean that we've lost him? Damn it! Hey Kuma, what are you doing?! Sorry, Daigoro. If we worked a little harder... Gone to heaven on an empty stomach! If it comforts you... Here, take this honey, your favorite food... Let Kumagoro stay by your side. Hold on... Daigoro! Uncle! Honey! You did a great job, Mr. Kumagoro! I sent a sample of what you found in Daigoro's mouth, by helicopter. Our scientists analyzed it. The report has just arrived. As I thought, these are the cells of a big monster. Thank you very much. It's nothing! When I fell into Daigoro's mouth, I had a look around. I was just there... deep in his throat, you know? It was like just that. There I found it. He was gasping for air. I had to help him so I tore this thing out... But honey, you were unconscious when they pulled you out. This is because... Well, you see... He noticed that I had it in his mouth. And he didn’t calculate his strength slightly when he pulled me out... Probably. Oh, it hurts... Come on now! Hey! Does your wound only hurt when something goes against your heroic fantasy? Be that as it may, according to the report, the sample contained substances that don't exist on Earth. Does this mean that he flew from another planet? I see. That is why Daigoro repeated: "Wow! Wow!" So, Daigoro saw a monster arrive from space? This is consistent with the large shooting star that the fishermen saw. - Is a shooting star a meteor? - Yes. So this is a meteorite monster? As you know, the Earth is surrounded by air. But, Taro, air doesn't exist for humans sake. It protects the Earth from various objects that fall on it from space. But people carelessly handle the air. They upset the balance of the atmosphere. Recent reports of meteorites falling say that now they began to fall more often. They are bigger and heavier. Therefore, it became possible for an alien monster to fall to Earth. I wonder where he is now? By the way... After the attack on the industrial zone, he went back to sea. Now his trace is completely lost. We need to find him sooner and shoot him with a nuclear missile missile. That's all. You're right. Shoot him down. This monster seriously injured Daigoro. That's actually a bad idea. Why? Suppose he is at sea... Suppose we even find him. We can't defeat him with the atomic bomb. Because if you use an atomic bomb in the sea, all the water around Japan will be contaminated with radiation! What will happen to the sea and fish? We have already polluted them. And if we use missiles with conventional warheads, that monster will still stand steady as rock. What?! If we kill him with an atomic bomb, will we lose marine resources? Are you kidding me? You say we have already lost the sea due to pollution? And still you don't approve of this idea? I don't understand your logic. If you leave such a terrible monster alone, you never know what will happen in the future. In that case, it’s best to blow it up. It's all-or-nothing. Right, Hachi? Yes. Everything needs to be done at the first impulse. As they say, do what you can, and be what will be. Right? What do you mean "be what will be"? This ain't a fight with a bully at the gates. Your kick from the jump against the monster will not help. Bring it on! I got a lot of guts! Just give me the bomb, I will crawl into its mouth with it while he sleeps. I’ll launch it and... boom! What will happen to you? With me? The bomb will explode, and I, too, boom! - Do you have any better ideas? - Of course not! - Well, shut up! - What are you doing?! Quiet, quiet, quiet... Kuma! Kuma! Kuma? I'm not Kuma! Who are you? - Stop fighting! - It's none of your business! Come on, eat! Here! Don't be shy! Eat and grow big! Do you hear, Daigoro? Get bigger and stronger! You will become a great monster that no one can defeat! You have quite the sponsors, don't you, Daigoro? At first they told you to be smaller, but now they want you to become big. Hold on! Daigoro! Don't overdo it. We don’t want your stomach to hurt. Right? Yes, like that! You and I are friends! Good? Don't get flattered, Daigoro. Karate? Karate... This isn't working. You don't look scary at all! Watch out! You idiot! How dare you! Meanwhile with the space monster... "SPACE MONSTER COUNTERMEASURES AT STANDSTILL" With the atomic bomb, you can even kill a space monster. But that means... That together with him, we'll kill off the sea. We can’t eat fish. We can’t eat shellfish. We can’t even swim in it. Do you really think that's good? I'm afraid we have no choice. Mankind must survive. But if we do, I wonder... How many more years can people live on Earth? A hundred years? Fifty years? Well... When, after the sea, we also lose the sky, we can no longer live here. However, even if human wisdom is so great, that's helped people overcome many troubles over tens of thousands of years, every new trouble seems terrible to us. Yes. The next day... Daigoro. Are you ready? Raise your hands. Well done! Turn them slowly. Get together... Say: "Kaaa!" I've been wondering what he's been in Tokyo for... It would be better if he taught him something like: "Haaa! Henshin!" Daigoro, don't give up! Just do what I told you to! It takes only a little concentration and willpower! Try again! I knew that nothing would come of it. Really, except for huge growth... Daigoro didn't inherit anything more from his parents? Daigoro is still a child! Back off. Daigoro, don't give up! Hurrah! Help! Help! Daigoro, thanks! - Japan's finest! - How cool! The space monster's been found! Hey! They found him! - He was found! - Found it! Found it! Ladies and gentlemen... Get to the point. The monster that sleeps behind the island of Emakajima... for the time being, I'll call it... Goliath. I studied the records of Goliath's attack on the industrial zone. It seems that the horn above the eyes play a part in Goliath's heat rays. Therefore... Hey, wait. Don't babble about. Are you speaking English? In short, you want to use the thing that you invented on this "Golf..." - Goliath. - ...to defeat him? - Yes. - Well, let's do it! We'll load it into the gun and... boom! It is necessary not to shoot, but to place it. Place it? We will climb onto his horn and leave it there. Climb the horn? Can you do it? Wait, honey! Why are you giving up? Don't worry about me back here. I'm the wife of the famous Kumagoro Onizawa! I can manage fine without you! Okay? Wait, Hachigoro, you too! Kumagoro, you'll do it? So... There it is. So huge, Hachi. Listen, Daigoro. Set off as soon as you see the signal light. It won't be scary. Goliath will no longer have a horn. Get together and aim at his weak spot. Defeat him with one blow! If it doesn’t work, run away and come back here. Listen, Daigoro! If you defeat Goliath, I'll make sure you get that budget! - We land here. - Here? Wait... One, two, three... - Now let's moor... - Kuma, hold on. - Help me. - Now. - Ready? - Yes. You cold? - Just excited. - What are you talking about? I will prepare the beacon fire on top of this cliff. When you successfully cover up his horn, send me a signal. Let's go. Okay. Right, Hachi? Yes. Are you okay? Yeah yeah. Okay... You doing okay? Damn, these rocks are so hard to climb. I should've learned rock climbing when I was younger. Now it's too late. There's no weeds here at all... it hurts! Hey Hachi... - What? - Do you see him? No, I don’t see. Come on. How can you not notice such a creature? Wait a minute... There is a place where there is a lot of grass... And behind it is such a black hill. Yes? - So what? - The foot of the hill ends here, yes? Right. Then we stepped on the rock there, and walked through along... As a result, we came here from there. They're connected, man! Hachi, you saw it? I saw it. - You saw it? - I saw it. Wait... Listen... What is it? I can hear "dub... dub." Do you hear too? Idiot! Go carefully... Yes, yes, over there. Back, back. No no. On the back. Yes, right. He doesn't know! Doesn't know! On the back. On the back. Do you understand? This fool thinks everything's alright! Buddy! - What's the matter? - We want to say... - A horn! - The head? - Imagine that I'm a monster. - This ain't the time for games! I don’t understand what you want to say. Behind you! - Behind you! - Behind you! The signal! - Daigoro, good luck! - Daigoro, go for it! It's cold here, right? You're so brave... Even in such a dangerous situation, you only care about whether it’s cold or hot. Probably the monster draws energy from the surrounding air. Therefore, when it absorbs energy, the air around it cools sharply. And in some cases it causes snowfall. He really does babble on, doesn't he? Umeko! Be a good widow! Watch it! The horn! Damn it. Sorry. Okay. Hey, Kuma! Tell him! And that too. Damn, he'll notice us! Hachi! It's done! Honey! Kuma! What are you doing? Wrap it around, come on! - Hachi! - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... - Come here. - Hold on! Okay! - Jump, Hachi! - Alright! One-two... I don’t know how to swim! Oh, right... Daigoro! Hang in there! Daigoro, hold on! Hurrah! Daigoro! - Help! Help me! - It's alright! What? Umeko! Honey! - Umeko! - Honey! Honey... Umeko! Where? Where are you? Umeko? And the epilogue... It means an afterword. Goodbye! Bon voyage! Bye-bye! Go back home! And don't come back! Just a sec... What's the matter? This string... Ah, yeah, of course! What a happy couple! - Stop! - Okay! Let me do it myself. - Thanks. - Well, now a toast! Cheers! Wow! Uncle! Congratulations. I'd... wanted to come to your wedding. Well, I don't! Ah! This damn gate! It's broken! Where are you going? Come back! Many thanks! Many thanks! The end!
