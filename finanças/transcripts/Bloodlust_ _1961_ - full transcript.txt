Hey Tony watch it, will ya? We want to get back to port nice and dry. Yeah, are you trying to drown us or something? Don't worry. Just dont worry. Get you all home safe and sound. I got this with one hand. uh-oh johnny i think he's at it again. If he does that once more i think i am going to be sick. I think all this action has made the fish sick. i can't make contact at all. ok betty let her go. [gunshot] hey not bad, not bad at all. Here you want to try? Sure, only theres one hitch. What? No more bottles. Well i guess we have to play a different game. What can we do out here? Well, this is always fun. With all the girls in the world i had to get mixed up with a daughter of a judo expert. Daddy told me lots of men like to wrestle. Well, thats not what i had in mind. Hey come here. What is it? Look at that. Theres an island over there i don't remember seeing before. Well this is the brightest day we had on this vaction. Must of been hidin in the mist before. Oh.. A mysterious hidden island lets go ashore. What for? Maybe we will find some hidden pirate treause. Maybe it would be fun. What do you say Johnny? Why not? this boat is costing us. Let's see everything we can. Hey Tony! We Want to goto shore. Boy he's really tied one on this time. You and the girls get the dingy ready.I'll take us closer to shore. Ok. Come back, come back you fools! Dont land there. Come back. I wonder if anyone lives here. No chance if there were natives they would of spotted the boat and tryied to sell us hand painted coconuts. What do we do now? Well captain kidd buried his loot over there. Hey lets race over there, last one doesent get the jewels. See what did i tell you, this looks like the remains of captain moregans flagship. But back there you said it was captain kidds. i did? Well i guess one pirates gold is as good as anothers. Hey i found something, is it armor, pirate armor? Well, lets say its something the tide washed in. I think you are too young to know about it. Hey gang come here! Did you find something Johnny? You bet i did. Look. Some of the best eats in the water, alot of clams. I am getting hungry. lets have a clam bake. Tropical style. Pete and I will go into the jungle get banna leaves wrap the clams in them and bake them in a hole in the sand. You girls dig the sand. Oh thats fine. All except the last part. huh? Where you go, we go. Right. We'll all dig for the leaves. ok ok come on lets go. Hey jon, what about banna trees? Hey a cigarette pack. And it's not too old i can smell the tabbacco. Then someone does live here. Not necceserily maybe they went exploring and sailed away. I am scared. Lets go back to the boat. Theres nothing to be scared of. Lets go back to the beach. Come on. Whoa! Johnny! Oh we got to get him out of there. He looks hurt. I'll get some vies we can use to pull him out. This was a trap. Who could of dug it? I don't know but as soon as we get him out were out of here. Wait, I'll climb down. Will need you here to pull him up. Ok but be carefull. Ok. Ok start pulling Help them quickly. I came here shortly after the war, i came to live in a world my own. A world completely free of outside pressues. But what do you do here? Yea how do you get kicks in a place like this? Kicks? Oh i have found diversions. I have devloped a passion for hunting. So thats it. Thats why the trap.. No No you are quite wrong. You see this island was once the strong hold of renegades of the mainland. Maybe one or two of them still lurk in the jungle but that must of been there handiwork. With all the different animals on the island they cant be native. They were'ent. If you must know what money can accomplishment, it's quiet simple to import any kind of beast from any part of the world. as other men collect fame and riches. I collect trophys. Get outta of my way. I thought you had vistors. I hear these strange voices. Yes dean, these young people have stumbled on to my retreat. I see you are not feeling well again this evening? Thats right. Maybe umm.. I Should not bother with introductions i'll go back to my room. I think that will be best. You can meet our young friends later. Thats right.. meet our.. young friends.. later. Later. It's really too bad dean was really once a brillient man. But cant help feel sorry for him and he is a excelent chess player. I know you will all enjoy his company when he is sober and get a chance to know him. Sure your right sir, but we have to leave. You see our boat is anchored off the island. I am afraid it's out of the question. You'll never make it thought the jungle tonight. But our boat the captian does not know we're ashore. You can put your minds to rest. I have very competent staff that will take care of everything. Will you excuse me a moment, i'll be back. Johnny, Johnny what are we going to do? This place gives me the creeps. I don't know i want to see what gives. Sure, what do you think is gonning to happen when tony wakes up and finds us gone? He will head stright back to port. Maybe remember to report us missing. We will be stuck here for days. Dont worry about that. Tony won't be goning anywhere without us. What do you mean? I made sure of that before we left the boat by takeing the roter. He won't be able to start the engine without it. oh pete your wonderful. That takes care of the boat.. I think he's coming back. May I prestent my wife. Sandra this is Betty, Jeanne, Johnny and Pete. I was sure that you would want to make them welcome to our island. Naturally I am gald to see you. Will you be staying for awhile? Well you see Mrs. Balleau.. Yes they will my dear. I think i convinced them not to leave tonight. Johnny: But we don't want to impose. It's our pleasure. Isn't it Sandra. Of course. And now if you would show the girls to the guest room. Yes. Will you come with me please? I've made arrengments for you to stay a comfortable night. We can disscuss your leaveing in the morning. Jondor has prepared a room for you. He will take you to it. I dont think.. GOODNIGHT. Don't worry everything will be taken care of. Dean we have to be careful he could walk in at any moment. He has spys all over the house. I know. I know, I can't take much more of his madness. I cant go on pretending to be a useless drunk. We got to try to escape. We got to try again. But how dean, how? Can't let anyone leave this place alive. Make sure anyone will. I know. It's a long shot with those kids here, we have a chance. What do you mean? I want to... ahhh Sandra, entertaing our guest? You have recovered from your indisposition it seems. I am glad. Thank you. I was just about to tour the grounds. Would you two like to join me? You two go out so seldom. I am tired Alex I want to goto my room. Dean? No, No thank you.. i think i'll turn in to. Then you won't mind escorting sandra to her room. will you? Of course not. Dean: Goodnight. Dean? I have worked out a very satifactory design of living here. I think you will relize that. I also realize the presents of thoes four young people changes nothing. I have taken care of everything. You don't think we are dreaming do you Betty? No, this is no dream. I can't think of a better explnation either. Come in. Are you alright? So far we are. I cant understand whats happend to us. Neither can I. The big guy that took us to our room was'ent very friendly. I got a feeling this isnt as friendly as Mr. Bellaue tries to make out. I still cant figure out how it got here on the island in the first place. Well i figure this place was built by you know one of thoes crackpot million-airs about a hundred years ago. Then when Belleau found out about it he just sort of moved in. You know that could be it, he said he had alot of money. But why? I still don't know whats going on here. No one will tell us. We will have to find out for our selfs. Yeah but how? Lets split up and have a look around. I dont know i am kinda scared. theres nothing to be scared of i'll be with ya. That's right and Betty will be with me. Now listen. Dont get anything you cant handle. If you find anything head stright back here. And we will do the same. Ok this is where we split. Pete you and Jeanne go that way. Ok. Don't make a sound. I promise to release you, don't cry out. All right go back to your room. We will go with you. We have to talk to you. What's this all about? Please go back to your room. We cannot talk to you here. Please there is death all around us. Ok, Betty come on. Hurry! Well? There is something i want to tell you. Unless you do exactly what I say, you will never get off this island. Wait here. there is a stairway that leads to some kind of tunnel. So? So let's see were it goes. Please listen to him. We are trying to help you and our selfs. I don't understand any of this. I will try to explain as quickly as i can. First we have to have your friends in here. But there not there. What? They are out in the house somewhere, trying to find out what is going just as we were when you stopped us. That's bad. I'll go look for them. No No No. Stay here. I want you to hear this first. I pray they will be alright. [Scream] [Creak] [Sounds of Bubbling] [Splash] I can't belive it, it's just too awful. Every word is true. I swear it. You have to believe us. [KNOCK] Not a word about this. Somebody give me a hand. Jeanne. You will never believe what we saw. I don't believe it my self. We just heard about it. I guess it is true. They told you about an unbeliveable nightmare. It's true all right. That settles it. We have to get out of here tonight. Tonight? Sandra and I have been saying that every night, that for the last year. Why didn't you ever try? We never had the opportunity. Balleau has always kept us covered. What can we do? Well i have a plan. I think that will give us all a good chance. Sandra. You and Betty look after Jeanne make sure she is all right. Johnny I want you and Peter to meet me in the trophy room. It's all right. Be carefull what you say. But what about Balleau? You don't have to worry about him for a couple of hours. He is out in the jungle again, after another trophy again. You think this Gerrard charactor is on the level? Well he must be. Anybody in there right minds would want to get out of this place. And i don't think he's nuts. I just had to make sure Balleau really is gone. Does he go out every night? Yes. Every night he can hunt. What? I mean who? Who? Out there in that jungle there are several men that he has driven insane. Also the owner of your boat. Tony?!? Well he must still be out on the boat the engine won't work. Well i am sure now that Balleau has taken that boat to the other side of the island. There is a hidden cove. A hidden cove? Well wheres that? Thats where your only escape lies. How do you mean? There are several boats moored off shore Someone will have to swim out to one of them and try to get to the main land to get help. Well, i am not much of a swimmer but i'll try. No No I will do that myself. Sandra will come with me. Sandra? Yes. She is an excellent swimmer. And even if we dont make it drowning would be better than what Balleau had in mind for both of us. Where do we fit in in all of this? I am gonna tell ya. You are goning to have to cover for us. If the guards find us gone divert their attention until we get to the boat. After that. I am afraid you have to look after yourselves. Until i can come back with help. Johnny? Look i know it doesn't sound very promising. But believe me it's the only chance you got. Well i guess we will have to take it then. Good. Now listen to me. First, we go over to the north shore. Did they get away? Well so far so good. As far as the front door nobody saw them. Balleau guards must be getting careless. One of them walked by Sandra's room without even checking it. [door closes] Do you think he knows? I don't know if he and Sandra had time to get into the jungle. Let's hope they make it to the cove. Do you think Bellaue stopped him? Wait a Minute. Just want to make sure of the direction. That guard won't be back right away. Yes thats it. Dean? What is it? I may never get a chance to say this again. I love you with all my heart. Darling? We won't fail. We can't fail. Come on. did you find anything? No. I heard two guards talking. One had been to the cove but dident metion the boat. Two days now and no word. What i can't understand is why we have not heard from Balleau. You don't think? I don't know what to think. Somebody's coming What's going on in there Johnny? You game to try and find out? You don't mean? I think the answers to all our questions are lie behind that wall. We're going to find out right now. Voice: Good evening. This is a pleasant surprise. I was not expecting you but i am glad to see you. Come in, come in won't you? I have something i would like to show you. [SCREAMS] Welcome to my private trophy room. I had to intended to show it to you in time. But why not now? That's Jacoby. He had strangled seven women before he found his way to my island. His experience made him an adversary worthy of my skill. You hunted these people down? and killed them and did that to them? Exactly. I hunted them. Shall i tell you why? I been a scholar all my life. A curator of a large museum. When the war began. I, who never killed anything in my life found duty as a sniper. Sharp shooter because of my steady hand and keen eye sight. [Laughs] It amuses me now, i found it distasteful. At first And as time went by i adjusted to my new activity. What had been an unplesent duty became a pleasure. Then into a passion, then a lust. A lust for blood. A lust that has grown years. and one that i spend my entire life tried to satisfy. Don't be afraid. I mearly preserve my trophys they were at the monment of my triumph. [SCREAMS] I see that my latest trophy has really impressed you. i am glad because i think its the best thing i have done. So far. And because they try to betray me it gave me great satisfaction. I must leave you now. Since you had no difficulty finding your way here i am sure when Mrs. Scott regains her composure you will be able to see her to her room. Oh yes there's one thing more i would like you to see before you go. You'll notice this nice has room for three. Or even four trophys. And there you have it. I think it will be a wonderful sport. Dont you? Listen mister Balleau, fun is fun. But if you think we're going to be the clay piegons in your shooting gallery. Then your a little far out. Take it easy Johnny, he must be kidding. There must be an explanation for all this. Well isn't there? i think i had made my self quite clear. But you can't hunt Johnny and Pete like you did the others. Like they were animals. Animals no. Not like animals. I am going to hunt them as men. Men of brains and cunning. Just as i stalked and hunted men in the army. Tony! Yes. Tony. I think it only be fair he be here too, because he's going to take part in the game. No No. Please don't send me out there with them. Tony you have outlived your usefulness to me. I paid you well to provide me with subjects in the past. I warned you not to use your boat for other purposes. But since you have been so foolish, i think its right you should share their fate. Do you mean? Tha's exactly what i mean Tony was the source of supply for subjects. In the past they were always convicts, escapes from the big island. Now i find it no longer dependable. You really think you can get away with this madness? Madness? What i planned is a pleasent evening diversion. See. That was just a toy. It's not gonna kill anyone. I guess it could kill somebody. Yes it can. Soon we'll try to prove it. Please Mr. Belleau, don't do this awefull thing. Betty: Oh Please! You have nothing to be alarmed about young lady, you are in no danger. Your life here with me will be a most pleasent one. You will find me a most accommodating host. Do you think Jeanne and I will let you send Johnny and Pete out into that jungle. Yes I think so. I know so. No one has ever left this island. Dead or alive. Since my wifes accident, i look foward to get to know you both better. Much better. Look isn't it enough you have to make sitting ducks out of pete and me. You have to hurt the girls too? Hurt them? Golly he really means it! What are we going to do? I asked the wrong person about your future activity. Go with Jondor. Jondor lock them in there room and come back at once. Really touching. Lets return to your questions. I will tell you what up to a certain point. The rest will be up too you. Are you listening tony? It applys to you to. Moonlight is bright tonight so you will make your way to the starting point of the chase It's in the center of the jungle, i will give you the exact directions. The natives call it the tree of death. I will give you plenty of time to plan your plight before i follow with the cross bow and just three of these. Just three shots. That's all i will allow myself. Very sporting don't you think? You have not answered me, don't you think it's very sporting of me to allow one chance at each of you. Oh sure. Real sporting. Regular Marquess of Queensberry. In a jungle you know like the palm of your hand? That thing you can knock an elephant over, your gonna hunt us down. Of course we have nothing to defen our selfs with. Not so fast. Not so fast. You have not yet let me finish. Tony? Here catch. Oh Tony it isn't loaded. You had us here with an unloaded gun. It's time to start. The odds are not completely one sided, your youth and numbers against my skill and experience. You will find ammo inside the braches of the tree of death. When that gun is loaded, my life also be subject of how the hunt goes. That rat. That lousy stinking rat One shell! He only left one shell! That's the way he's twisted mind works. What do you mean? Dont you see. He gets three, we only get one shot at him. Theres is nothing we can do about it. Give me the gun and let's get moving. No you don't buster. You just hand over that bullet. Don't be a fool Tony i am a better shot than you are. Yeah? Have you ever shot a man? No. Well i have. I ain't takeing no chances on no amature. Well which way should we go? I don't know which way you two guys are going. But i am going alone. So long suckers. Hey come back here! No let him go. It's better if we do split up, it doubles our chances. How? Belleau can't hunt in two different directions at once. The way i figure it we are in the middle of the island. We will goto the beach and work our way back to the house. Back to the house?!? Are you nuts? We have to get the boat. No we have to get the girls out first! Belleau said he would'ent touch.. Nevermind i know what he said. I dont like the way thoes goons of his kept looking at the girls. Come on! Let's get started. I just don't see how.. nevermind we got to do what we can! That's the first thing. Here's to hopeing we find the second thing. The guard is still out there and wide awake. Oh Betty what are we going to do? Even if we do get out of this room where are we going to go? I don't know. Maybe we can find the boys and try to get to the boat. We don't even know where it is. Oh it's just no use. Oh even this window is locked. Come here Jeanne. Listen to me. I've got an idea. Dont ask any questions just do exactly as i say. All right what do you want me to do? Here. [LOUD CRASH] Oh i am terribly sorry. I was moveing it and it just broke. I am sure i can fix it if you get me some glue. I did'ent mean to break it. It, it was such a pretty vase. [Laughs] Jeanne come on hurry. Come, on. I'll help you climb out. Out there?!! We'll be killed! No we won't theres a ledge out there. We'll work along the ledge to an open window. It's the only way. Come on. Be careful. [JUNGLE NOISES] Hurry, hurry. [CLICK] [CLICK, CLICK] Don't tell me, we've come to the end of the train. [CLICK, CLICK] I am disappointed in you Tony. You've know me long enough to realize i would give you a gun without first the precautions of removeing the fireing pins. You find that hard to belive? You see Tony, if i hadn't givin you the gun, you would not have givin me the pleasure of seeing your face at the moment of the kill. no no no.. please. Please, i'll never give your secret away. I promise. I'll get you more convicts. I'll never make a mistake again, please. Alright Tony i'll reconsider. oh thank you oh thank you. you won't be sorry. Enough of this i have work todo. Yes, yes sir i'll go right now. Tony! I have reconsidered. [SCREAMS] Sure i heard a scream. Can't tell, might have been a jungle bird. No. No. i am sure it was Tony. Were next. Come on Johnny, let's go find that boat. It's our only chance. We are not doing anything till we get the girls free. Come on. This is the way to the beach. Hurry back to the tree of death. We'll pick up the trail there. Well we made it this far. Well where is this far? I don't know but it is closer than far away than that room. Come on. Hold on. Thats the door to the terrible work room i told you about. Wait a minute, maybe there is a knife in there. Come on. [DOOR CREAKS] Betty: Over here. We got to get a couple of these we can carry easily. It's no use Betty even if we did, i could'ent use one it anyway. Jeanne listen to me.. Good evening ladies. Keep away from us. Keep back! I am warning you, I'll use this. Jeanne run for the door he can only get one of us. Mr. Balleau told me.. to take good care of you ladies. don't come any closer. can't you see i am harmless. I am not going to hurt you... [SCREAMS] Cant you see? [SCREAMS] [SPLASH] [[SCREAMS] What's the use? it's just a matter of time before Balleau catches up with one of us. I don't think we are lost. The jungle is thinning out, we must be getting close to the beach. So what. I don't mean to put you down Johnny, but if we find the beach what.. Hold it. Well come on we have to make time. This way. [SCREAMING] Don't make a sound. [YELLS] He hasent seen us yet. Back off. [YELLS] I can't get out. Im sinking. It's quick sand. Don't struggle, keep quiet. Something scared him. We have to get out of here too. I can't make it Johnny. I just can't make it. Get them off of me!! [CRICKETS CHURP] Balleau not far behind us. I think that's what scared off our little friend off. Umm Pete you think you can make it? Do i have a choice? [JUNGLE NOISES] Are you hurt? Just my dignity. Now what? We are out of that awful house. We have to try to find the boys. I just hope Balleau doesn't find them first. What's the matter with you, you clumsy ox. Thats twice tonight you givein our position away. Now you cant even find the trail. [LAUGHS] How grateful of your own stupidity will save me the troble of getting rid of you. Too bad the leeches will do there work so well. You might of made an interesting specimen for my museum. [YELL] Oh i am sorry Jondor. I won't be able to stay for your last moments. I am required elsewhere. OK? I guess so. We better keep moveing then. We'll never find the boys just sitting here. Can i just say it. What? I am scared. Well if it makes you feel any better so am i. But we have to go on. Let's go this way. [SCREAMS] [GIRLS SCREAM] That's Betty and Jeanne. Jon: Come on. [SCREAMS] [YELLS UNCONTROLLABLY] You all right? Come on let's get out of here fast. So it's you. I had thought to premit you to enjoy the hospitality of my island. While i took care of more bigger business. But since... [SCREAMS] I don't know how long we can hold on to this kind of luck. If Balleau does'ent get us the... We have to try a grandstand play. Betty? Did any Balleau boys follow you? From the sounds they made i say the whole bunch is after us. Good. They will be out of the house. Pete drop down and see if there are any signs of them. Pete? Be careful. Let me at them. It's ok. ok. Come on. We have'ent got a chance without a gun. We got to get back into the trophy room. we can't we just got out of there. Balleau's guards will still be looking for you girls. If we can shake Balleau and get back before the guards do, we can get the guns. and maybe stay alive to find the boat. Come on. Theres one guy not combing the bushes. Should we jump him Johnny? No i don't think so. I think our best chances are to sneak past him. It's locked! You surprised? Oh very funny. Don't just stand there try to find something to open this with. What are we going to do? Try to find the boat. Jeanne: I don't want to stay here any longer than we have to. That should do the trick. Neck broken. There's no ammo here. Theres got to be these guns are useless without it. I know, i know. Somebodys coming. Let's get out of here. Well well. I am flattered someone should further should look at my souvenirs. No one ever has come back a second time. Lies. It's rather dark in here. Perhaps we should have alittle more light. Try here. Or there. No? Well, eh.. Theres plenty of time. Strange about these old walls. The smallest sound is amplified. If one sits still, one could hear the slightest murmur, sometimes the slightest breath. Theres a certain closeness about this place. I have never corrected it. It helps preserves my trophys. but at times it does make breatheing difficult. I have sat here for so long, i sit for hours. and not make a single sound. Not a single sound. [COUGHS] A single sound. Stay just where you are. that's far enough Balleau dont come any closer. I thnk it was rather rude of you to force open my gun cabnet. But I'll over look it. Since you spared the ammo chest. oh yes. I know your guns are quite useless. no no. I wouldn't try that if i were you. It would only hasten your death that of your friends. ok Balleau you win. I never doubted it. Did you? Why don't you get it over with? Not so fast. My young friend. I have an idea that appeals to me. Let me group you in this setting, alive as you will be in death. For all time. What do you mean? I'll show you i've never had the pleasure trial arrangerment of my trophys. You Pete. Over there. Move. And you my dear. I thnk you will be most effective with arms around Johnnys neck. Now wait a minute, you promised you would not hurt the girls. That's right i did promise. But since they obviously helped you kill the guards, i am afraid i can no longer trust them. Guard? We did'ent kill any guard. What? Honest. The only guard we saw was at the gate. and we snuck past him. Quiet don't make a sound. any of you. Not a sound. You over to my chair and throw the last switch. Move quickly. Hurry the last switch. Jondor stop. I warn you. [YELLS] [SCREAMS] Take it easy Betty. It's all over and we'll be safe now. Were not off this horrible island. theres others. Dont worry, with Balleau dead there shouldn't be any trouble. I guess Balleau never thought he would be the prize exhibit in his own museum.
