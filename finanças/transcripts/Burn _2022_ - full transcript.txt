Aw, fuck. Ah, shit. Mr. P, I don't think you wanna see this. Okay? This is Max. Yo, Max, it's Seth. We need to talk. What's this about? I'd rather not say over the phone, we got to meet in person. Sure, where do you wanna meet? Maximillian. Seth. Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy. This is a friendly meeting, all right? How many poor souls, buried out here, bought that line? Aw, you got a point there. Look, put the gun down. Put it away. Wha...? You wanna frisk me? Is that it, huh? You wanna piece of me? There you go. I know you want it. So why am I out here in the middle of nowhere? First of all, before we go any further. what in the fuck is that? What? My Prius? Yeah, your... your Prius. It's my new G-ride. Yeah. My grandmother, grandmother has the same model. Yeah, well. What can I say? I'm socially and economically responsible. That's good. Oh, that's good. A gangster with a Prius. Oh, shit. Actually, that's brilliant. What's this about? It's about your fuckin' brother, alright? He did it this time. He fucked up. You gotta keep that kid on a leash, Max. Now look, I'm comin' to you because I respect you. I appreciate it. How bad? Bad. I got the contract, late last night. Why the fuck is there a contract on my kid brother? 'Cause he's fucking the wrong missus. That's why. Mr. Pinero wants it done. And that's it. There's no takin' that back. And you know it. Jesus fucking Christ. Now, look, I can play dumb for a couple of days but that's about it. Then I gotta go after him. I understand. Any idea where he's at? Yeah, he's around. But I wanted you to hear it from me first, Max. Alright? Now, when you find him, just remember, you got a couple of days. Hopefully, you'll do the right thing. If not, then. we're gonna have to draw on each other. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Only if you help the kid out. If not, this is easy. He's my kid brother. Understand. I figured you'd feel that way. I just needed to mention it. Where's he at? Can't you read the sign? I do not want to be... Vince, it's your brother Max. Open up! I can't help you if you don't open the door. How'd you know I was here? Seth called me. What do you plan on doing with that gun? Vince! It's for protection! What the fuck do you think? All right, relax, Vince. I'm here to help. I shouldn't trust anyone right about now, you know. Vince, I'm your brother. I said it was fine. How bad is it? It's bad. They rushed her to the emergency room. She didn't make it. Why don't you give me that gun? Housekeeping. N-no, we're fine. Thank you. Jesus! Can't they read the fucking sign? Do not disturb! What is so hard to understand about that? - Fuck! - Give me that gun. Vince! Fuck, Max! I need that! You don't know what you need! You're out of fucking control! Wavin' this gun around. You're liable to shoot yourself, or me! Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm covered in blood. Man, how long have you been here? Um. I don't know. it was, five o'clock last night. And you still haven't cleaned yourself up? Who else knows I'm here? It doesn't matter. Seth knows. He tipped me off where you were. There a contract out on me? Seth's got it. Shit. He comin'? Yeah, he'll be comin'. But as a courtesy to me, he gave us two days. I see. Well, that is just fuckin' nice of him, ain't it? I'll find that piece of shit first. And what are you gonna do when you catch up with him? - Kill him. - Shut your mouth. You kill Seth, they'll just send somebody else, and they'll keep comin' until you're dead. Max, you gotta believe me, Max. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to fucking kill her, Max. I know, Vince. I know. You want to tell me what happened? I don't know. It's... it's just. somethin' took over me. It was just. she blindsided me, man. Come here. You were fucking Gino Pinero's wife? Not fucking. We were in love. Yeah, I'll bet ya, it was wonderful. Fuck you. Don't do that, Max. When did this start? 'Bout two months ago. Jesus Christ. Yo, so this was the other night, right? I'm telling you, this broad is like smokin', just unbelievable, you know. So, I get her back to my place and. the body on this broad is like. goddess, right? But. here's the thing. I went out for Chinese food that night before I hit the club and that shit put a real monkey wrench in my plans. See, I got this, like, um, spicy Szechwan Chicken, just like, workin' its way through my stomach. I got bubble guts to the ninth degree. You know, never before in my life has anything happened like this. You know, on the one hand, I got a ragin' fuckin' hard on. And on the other hand, I gotta take a sh. - Vince? - What? You're not even listenin' to me. Yeah, I am. Dude, you're talkin' about a smokin' hot broad. Smokin' hot broad? That's all you heard? You fucked her, right? You didn't even hear about the spicy Szechwan chicken. What? What the fuck? Spicy Szechwan Chicken? You're fucking crazy, dude. Fucking crazy. All right, never mind, all right. What's got you so fucking preoccupied? Yo, are you fucking nuts? You're gonna get us both killed. I'm not doin' nothin'. That's Gino Pinero over there. Yeah, I know who he is. You know that's the guy's fucking wife, right? Who? Who? The unbelievable smoking hot blonde, sittin' over there - making eyes at you. - So what? - .you making eyes back at her. - So what? Man, just look away. Get the fuck off me. For God sakes, man, just look away. Yeah, I'm tellin' you, man. I did not make the first move. You know, I could kill you for bein' so stupid. Do you know you could have gotten me killed, doin' that? It's got nothin' to do with you, Max. You stupid fuck! I work for Pinero. The only thing in life he loved more than money was that woman. She was his prized possession. Yeah. Obviously, the feeling wasn't mutual. What was I supposed to do? Find another floozy! There's a million fucking broads in LA and you gotta pick the one that's gonna get you killed. I couldn't help myself. Excuse me. Can you hand me a match? Here you are, ma'am. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to him. Vince. I'm Vince. You smoke? Nah, we don't smoke. I could start. You mind? Let's go for a smoke. Sure. Great, the cock-blockin' friend. So you're gonna pay for your tab this time? The fuck you talkin' about? I always pay my tab. You know, my friend's got my wallet. And when he comes back, pay the tab. Okay. You guys doing okay? It really happen like that? Yeah, I'm... I'm tellin' you, man. She was just so, so strong and forward. I mean, who was I to say no? You know, for once in your life, you should have listened to that dipshit friend of yours. Bobby. What does he know? Absolutely nothin'. But he had the sense enough to know, you stay away from Pinero's wife. It... It was like this magnetic pull. I just... I couldn't turn away. So what's the plan? I don't know. We gotta weigh our options here. We make a false move and that's it, we're done. I'd rather not travel by daylight. We gotta get you out of town. I'll gonna make some calls, see if there's a place we can hide you out, lay low as long as possible. You don't have to do this, you know? What are you talkin' about? You can take off anytime you want. Yeah, and leave you here all alone to figure this thing out? I know you're stickin' your neck out here for me. And that's just what I'm gonna do. I'm here until we get you outta this thing. I'm as good as dead, aren't I? Not if I can help it. You're my kid brother. I'm here until we get you out of this. Uh, who else is comin' for me? As far as I know, just Seth, he's got the contract. But he says he's gonna give us two days. You trust him? Yeah, I don't see why not. Yeah, I know. But what the fuck else we gonna do? Thanks. Yeah. I've seen you here before. You remind me of someone my husband knows. Yeah, it's. um. Probably my brother, Max. He does some work for your husband. You know my brother? You're not smoking. Hmm. Yeah, I don't smoke. Hmm, right. Your boyfriend said that. My boyfriend? Relax. It's just a joke. Oh, that's, um. funny sense of humor you got there. You. like my. sense of humor? Jesus, lady. Are you fucking nuts? We're alone. And besides. I won't tell if you don't. Wow. Who are you? And with that, I was hooked. She became an addiction, you know. Yeah, I know the type. I know it may not seem like it, but I've been there before. Who? Forget about it. No, really. Tell me, I mean, you always seem all business and no fun. I mean, I'd like to hear about her. Yeah, well, I was smart and I broke it off before I did somethin' stupid. Unlike you. Then she must not have meant that much to you. You don't know what you're talking about. Then tell me about her. I bet you, she wasn't as hot as Laurel. Better. Bullshit! I always got hotter women than you. Says who? Oh, come on, you know I did. I mean, you want to run your list alongside mine, see who comes out ahead? Denise Levine. Melissa Rios. Sara Corbett. Juliet Tebbs. Amy Hahn. My... my list is long, you're gonna start running out of names, pal. Viv. Viv... I don't know what Viv's last name is. Then it doesn't count. Oh, fuck you, she was special. Oh, yeah, so special you don't even remember her name, right? Leslie Celso. What? She looked like a dude. What? A lil' dude-ish. Fuck you. Who is it? Fuckin' Bobby. Don't tell that creep where you're at. He gets a hold of that info and everybody in town's gonna know where you're at. He's not a creep. He's a fuckin' cretin. I don't even know why you hang out with that guy in the first place. He ain't so bad. Please, tell me you didn't tell him where you're at. Max, relax, I haven't talked to anyone. Good. What the fuck did I do? I loved her. That's called lust, not love. No, I'm serious. I've never felt the way that I did for this woman. Oh, Jesus Christ. It's okay. Why? Why what? Why'd you.? Um. she was, um. She was breakin' it off with me. She just... It's the way she did it, it was just, uh. it was so cold. And I... I just did not see it comin'. Come here. Ugh. What? I wanna talk to you. Okay. So talk. There's not an easy way to say this. Laurel, what the fuck is this? I like you, Vince. You like me? This is crazy, and it has to stop. Wait, no. Wait, what about our plans? Where would we go? Gino would come looking for me. Fuck Gino. Come on. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Jesus Christ, Laurel, why are you doing this? Come on, baby. Don't do me like this, come on. You're gutting me here. Why didn't you ever talk to Pinero on my behalf? What are you talkin' about? Come on, Max. How many times did I come to you? I mean, maybe, I wouldn't be in this situation. Fuck, Vince. You gonna lay a guilt trip on me, here? All I'm saying is that. maybe if you'd talked to Pinero, I would've been all right. I wouldn't be in this miserable situation right now. You better be a beautiful woman. Get the fuck outta here. Come in. Oh, my God. When did you get this, man? So? So what? It's 3:30 in the goddamn morning. So, what are you doing here? I wanted to come see my brother. Can't I do that? What the fuck are you on? Me and Bobby were out partying with these chicks. And, uh, they had some coke, so. How much did you do? You look like hell. I don't know, a lot. Get the fuck off my back. Look, Vince, I gotta get up early tomorrow. I got some work I gotta do. Um, that's actually why I came by. What? I want you to talk to Pinero for me. See about getting me some work. I'm dying over here. Yeah, I'll see what I can do. Jesus, Max. How long you been saying that, man? - What? - What? How long you been saying, "I'll see what I can do." You never say shit to him, man. Listen to me, Vince! Now's not a good time! Why the fuck not? I mean, look at you, you got everything, man! Money in your pocket. You have fucking paintings on the wall! Two bedrooms, lots of space! I live in a fuckin' studio apartment as big as your fuckin' bathroom, you selfish asshole! Vince, you're wasted! Why don't you sleep it off and we'll talk about it in the morning? - Here. - No, I don't want to sleep on your goddamn couch! I want you to get me a goddamn job! Vince, you're a fuckin' mess. Why would I go to Pinero for you? Max. you know what? Fuck you! Fuck you! You know, I'll go to Seth myself, - that's what I'll fucking do. - And what's Seth gonna do? Can't even get help from my own fucking family! Vince, calm the fuck down! Not! You know what? I'll go to Seth, he'll go to Pinero! I don't need your fucking help! You see, you never helped me. I mean, I always asked you, but you never helped me. I mean, I'm always rubbin' two pennies together while you were doing just fine. I always helped you out with money. I wanted to make my own. I didn't want a fucking handout, Max. The truth is. I thought you'd fuck it up. Okay? That's what I thought. What? Why the fuck would you think that? Come on, Vince. You were always blowin' shit up your nose, gettin' into trouble here and there. Pinero isn't the type to put up with that. You fuck up with him once and you're dead. Yeah, okay. Thanks for having so much faith in me. Vince, what can I do about it now? I guess nothing. She told me she would leave him. And you believed that? Yeah, I did. Fuck you. You don't know what we had. She was a married woman, Vince. We had plans. Do you know how fucking crazy you sound? She was Gino Pinero's wife. He's the boss of a major crime family. How far did you fuckin' think you were gonna get? I don't know. We didn't plan that far ahead. Oh, I wanna strangle you. If I'd've have known about this relationship before, I would've kick your ass and put a stop to it. You're living a goddamn fantasy in your own head. You were gonna run off with Gino Pinero's wife? I mean, that's just funny sayin' it. He would've never let that happen. He would have killed the both of ya. Have you eaten anything? No, not since yesterday. Why don't you get cleaned up? I'll get us somethin' to eat. These are the only clothes I have. I went to your place, I got you some clean clothes. Here. Fuck, Max, those are old clothes, I don't wear these anymore. Are you fucking kiddin' me? Go take a shower. What do you wanna eat? Anything will do, I'm fuckin' starving. Lock this door behind me. You my driver? That's right. Laurel. Max. Hi, Max. Hey. Let's go. You're welcome to sit in the back. Does it make you uncomfortable, me sitting up here, next to you. No, ma'am. What am I, your mother? What? Ma'am? Hi, I'm Laurel. Remember me? We met earlier. How could I forget? If you're comfortable. Very. So, where to? Today's my free day. Free day? Yeah, once a week, I get a free day away from Gino. He bought me that condo. I stay there one day a week. Okay. Anyway, I was thinking you could take me to the Beverly Center? The mall? Yeah, the mall. Was thinking you can carry my shopping bags for me. Um. shopping bags? I'm just playing with you, Max. God, you should have seen the look on your face. Well, I love going to the mall. Yeah, right. Well, the mall will have to wait. Just drop me off at a friend's house in Century City. Sure. I'll let you take me to the mall another day. Well, I'll look forward to it. Hm-hmm. - What'd you get? - Burgers, cool? Fuck yeah, I'm starving. Put 'em by the door, so we don't forget 'em. We'll have to burn 'em. Got you a coke, too. What'd you. What'd you do with the murder weapon? Shit! Oh, man. Ugh. I think I dropped the knife by the bed, after I... Fuck! All right. By now, the cops have that in evidence. I'm done for. - Just... - Max, if it's not Pinero, it's gonna be the cops. I mean, shit, I'd rather be dead than go to prison. Don't worry, if you go to prison, Pinero'll have somebody on the inside take you out. Is that supposed to make me feel better? No, that's why I need to focus here. As soon as the sun drops, we're gettin' out of here. I'm gonna step out and make some calls. Are you sure? I mean, who... who can we trust? I mean, who's gonna be on our side? I got some people, some people who don't necessarily like Pinero. I've been meaning to thank you. For driving me around the other day. I haven't seen you since. Yeah, I've been outta town. Where? Vegas. Don't worry about them. Huh? He's keeping tabs on me. Oh. Pleasure or business? What? Vegas. You go for business or for pleasure? Oh, pleasure. I took my girl. It was her birthday. That's sweet of you. Yeah. Look, um, I'm pretty bored. You would mind driving me home? Seth's driving tonight. No keys. That's okay. I'll go get the keys from him and then you can drive me. No, wait. Got the keys. Let's go. Where do you wanna go? Drive me to my condo? Sure. So, do you and your girlfriend live together? No, she's got her own place. Is it serious? As serious as I wanna get. So, not too? Yeah, not too. Does she know that? We don't talk about it. You got a minute? For what? I mean, you gotta be somewhere? Not this minute. Why don't you come upstairs and have a drink? I don't think so. Why not? Because Pinero's my boss. Max, it's only a drink. You comin' or what? All right, one drink. Thanks. How long have you been working for my husband? Two years. What do you do? Besides drive? If you think I'm naive and I don't know my husband's into some bad shit, you'd be surprised. That is between you and your husband. I'm not saying a word. It's kinda strange you even have this place. You mean, it's not conventional. Yeah, I'll say. I mean, what kinda guy lets his wife stay in a condo, once a week? If you were my wife, that wouldn't happen. But I'm not your wife. No, you're not. Gino and I have an arrangement. Keeps me happy. I keep him happy. I shouldn't have opened my mouth. I'm requesting that you be my permanent driver. I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? Don't you have a car? I don't drive. You don't drive? No, LA traffic makes me crazy. It's easier to have a driver. Well, I'm sure Gino'll find you a good driver. Don't you like me, Max? Now you're fuckin' with me. No, I'm not. I just asked a simple question. Don't you like me? You're likable enough. Come here. Come where? I gotta be outta my mind. Just shut up. Take me home? I thought you were home. I mean, the home I live in with my husband. Sure. Thanks. Oh, shit! I almost shot you. Lucky for you, you fuckin' didn't. Where do you keep your coffee cups in this shit hole? Second cupboard. Over here. So, I hope you don't mind. let myself in. Sure. Made some coffee, too. Long night there, Maxipad? Yeah. Yeah. I feel your pain. Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. Cha, cha, cha. A little EMM? What's that? Early morning martini. Coffee is fine. Coffee it is, comin' up. Where you been? My girl's. Your girl's? Yeah, Megan. What is this? You still seein' Megan? Every now and again. Oh, the evidence. Yeah, yeah. She still loves you. You can tell that by a text message? She's a good girl, okay? Seriously, you should make an honest woman of this one. 'Cause I'm gonna tell you somethin'. If you don't, some fuckin' chachule will come along and do it for you. You know why I know? 'Cause it happened to me. I was in love. - You? - Yeah, me. Didn't propose, figured we'd date forever, and what happens? Hmm? Some fucking chachule comes along and scoops her away. Boom, I'm out. I'm sorry to hear it. Sounds like a real sad story. Yeah, boohoo fucking hoo. But the next time. there's always a next time, Max. Next time, I'm gonna be the guy to slam the fucking ring down. Why are you here, in my apartment? Yeah, well, you and I have to take care of some business. Gino wanted me to come get ya. You know, we just gotta collect some money. Now? Now? No, I figured, you know, I'd come over here, we'd, you know, watch some gay fucking porn. I drink your shitty coffee. I got time for a shower? You better have time for a shower. 'Cause this motherfucker is gonna smell you coming a mile away, okay? Hardee fuckin' har. Yeah, make sure you scrub your balls really good there. Yeah. Which one is it? It's this one right here. What's that? A piece of shit. Infinity? Silver Infinity in the driveway. So what's the plan? You're goin' in alone. What the fuck for? 'Cause you've been told. He wants you to do this alone. Besides, you were gonna fuckin' put a cap in my ass this morning, remember? What'd he do? How many fucking times I gotta tell you? He owes us money, okay? Mr P. wants him put down, period. Like a dog. How's he gonna get paid if the guy's dead? What do you care? He wants it done, you do it. What does he look like? Are you fucking serious? Like a Barbra Walters Special. What does he look like? He fucking looks like your mother, fuckin' if she shaved her mustache. I'm serious. What if the guy's got a house guest, and I go in and pop the wrong guy? Holy shit, you won't. Okay? We know what we are doin'! He's in there alone. Get the fuck outta the car and fucking take care of business! I'm cranky, I'm tired. Uh-huh. Yeah, got ya. Easy, easy. That's it, that's it. Nice and cool and calm. Go, go, go. Hey, I just want to say, good work back there, Max. Really. Really, man. So, listen, lay low for a couple of days. All right? Don't make a lot of phone calls. Don't go out much. Just, you know, keep it simple. All right. Now let me have the gun and I'll get rid of it. I'll do it, I'll get rid of it. No, no, no, no, let me have the gun. I'll get rid of it. Let's go. I got it. You sure? I said I got it. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, Maxipad. Yeah, we'll be in touch. All right? What are you doing here? You gonna invite me in or not? Nice place. How did you know where I live? I have my ways. How'd you get here? What do you mean? I mean exactly that. How did you get here? I drove. I thought you said you didn't drive? Did I? Look, I gotta tell you, this makes me very uncomfortable, you bein' here. Why? We can't be playing games here. I'm not playing games with you, Max. You're a married woman. Look, somethin' happened today that really fucked with my head. What happened? I-I-I can't tell you what happened, but it made me realize that this isn't worth it. What isn't worth it? This. We. Let's just keep a comfortable distance away from each other. Okay? - Max. - What? You really need to relax. Do you know this could get us killed? If your husband finds out, I'm done for. I understand. Let's just keep this professional. I'll drive you wherever you wanna go. But that's that, I'm your driver. Okay. Okay? Okay. I can't tell you, that's like a ton of bricks off my shoulders. You know, you're pretty cute when you're nervous. Oh, really? Then I must be the cutest guy on the planet because whenever you're around, I'm nervous. I make you nervous? The circumstances make me nervous. You wanna fix us a drink? Yeah, sure. What are you doin'? Oh, shit. All right, I got us a place we can crash tomorrow in Vegas. That will buy us a few days until I figure this thing out. You done? Who the fuck is that? Bobby, again? Yeah. You better turn that fucker off. They got GPS; they could find you by your phone. Here, give it here. Did you know Laurel? Yeah, I did. She was beautiful, huh? Yeah, she was. Did you ever get to know her? I mean, she was. she was somethin'. She wasn't like anyone I ever met. I mean, really the ballsiest chick that I ever met. Yeah, I'm sure. Did you ever talk to her? Here and there, only when I drove her. She ever mention me? Not that I could remember. I remember the second I fell in love with her. How's... What's her name? Who? Uh-oh, you're already forgetting her. Who? Your girlfriend. Megan? No, I didn't forget her. I just didn't know who you were talkin' about. Uh-huh. It won't be long until. Until what? Until you're in love with me. You're so sure? Yeah, I am. I better go. Gino is expecting me. I'll let myself out. - Bye. - Bye. I just, I wish I'd never have met her. If I could erase one night of my life, it'd be the night I met Laurel. None of this would have happened. That's a lot of blood. I'm gonna take a leak. Hey. Hey, yourself. Is that for me? Yeah, it is. I gotta get goin'. I didn't want to just take off on you. Breakfast in bed? Yeah. No one has ever made me breakfast in bed before. - Really? - Really. You're the first. Oh, I hate to do this to you but. But what? I'm a vegetarian. You are? I didn't know that. Hmm, well, there's a lot of things we don't know about each other. Yeah, I guess so. You know, I had a dream last night that we were out in public. Didn't have to hide, just a couple, goin' out, without a care in the world. Well, you definitely know it's a dream. 'Cause the world we live in, we have to hide. Hmm, um, well, wouldn't it be nice though? Go out for a nice dinner, maybe a movie. Or both. Dinner and a movie. Share a bucket of popcorn. Yeah right, sounds nice. Hmm. Oh, but what about Megan? Forget Megan. It's more like what Gino would do to us if we were found out. Hmm. Besides, I'm not seeing Megan anymore. Oh, you're not? No. What happened? Nothin', it just kind of fizzled out. Did you break up with her because of me? No, we just kinda went our separate ways. Well, I like that. - Oh, you do? - Hm-hmm. I don't like sharing you with anybody. You're the one who's married. Do you want me to divorce Gino? Huh? Do you want me to tell Gino that I'm leaving him for you? No, absolutely not. I like bein' alive, you know, breathing. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive. I gotta get goin'. Oh, here. Have my bacon. You just say the word and I'll tell him I'm leaving. You know, you're jokin' but that's not funny. Who says that I'm joking? I better get goin'. Hey. Hey. What? I think I fell for you, Max. Yeah, I know. No. I mean it. I think that I love you. Hey, that's no. Do you love me, Max? Hey, hey, what is this? You gonna make me say it? I wanna hear it. This is no good. Just shut up and say it. Yeah, I love you, too. Max, you okay in there? Yeah, I'll be out in a sec. Hey, it's almost dark. We gonna be leaving soon? Yeah. What'd you check the room under? Um, fake name. I paid cash. Good. Don't check out. You don't want anyone else gettin' a good look at you. Seth comes around here, they're gonna tell 'im all about you and which way you went. How long we gonna be in Vegas? Couple days at the most. Then where? We'll figure that out when we get there. Yeah, fly by night sort of thing? Yeah. That's the best I got right now. I'm gonna pull the car up to the door, we'll throw the bloody bag in the trunk. Stay here until I get back, okay? You wanna another drink, honey? Yeah, I'm low. Seth? Seth? Yeah, Boss? Why don't you get the lady another drink, would you? Absolutely. Yo, Max, scooch out. Get me another Makers. You want something, Max? Yeah, another bourbon and diet. Kid, you're makin' me nervous, sit down. I'm gonna go to the little ladies room. Sure. Never got to thank you for that problem you took care of for me. Seth said you done real good. Yeah, it was my pleasure. You know my wife? She likes havin' you drive her around town. She told me, nobody but you. She said that? Yeah. Tried to have other guys drive her but, uh, she's adamant, only you. I don't know what's so special. Well, if I didn't know any better. Oh, no, Mr. Pinero, it's just. Relax, kid, I know you're not that stupid. You got a brain in your head. Besides, she's a lot to handle. If you know what I mean. She's a bit of a. pain in the ass. What were you two talkin' about? Driving. Driving? Yeah. Yeah. How much Max loves driving you around this lovely city of ours. Is that true, Max? Yeah. Thank you. Oh, no, no. Just slide in. Where you goin'? I'm going home. What's your problem? What do you mean? You haven't said two words to me all night. Come on, Max. What is it? What is it? Yesterday morning you told me you love me. And today, you're all snuggled up with the old man. That make you jealous? Just forget about it. No, I won't forget about it. You got a problem, we talk it out, solve the problem, like adults. You're a real piece of work, you know that? What is it, Max? What's got you all hot and bothered? You don't like seeing me with my husband? We shouldn't talk about this here. And where do you want to talk about it? Your place, my place? I'm goin' home. alone. Max! Ho, hey! Now you two, you two sound like an old married couple. It's nothin'. Where's my husband? The boss man wants you to drive the Missus home tonight. If that's not a problem? Yeah, no problem. He's kind of tied up, you understand. When will he be home? Who can tell? But he wants you, missy, to go home tonight and not the condo. Capiche? Yeah, sure. That's not gonna be a problem, is it, Maximillian? No, no problem. Good answer. Well, I'll just get my things. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Are you gonna say anything? What do you want me to say? He's my husband, Max. I know. I just. What? I didn't like seeing you like that, you know? Well, I'm sorry. You gonna open my door for me? Who's here? Just me. The cooks aren't even here yet. And I'm fuckin' starvin'. You cook? I can do toast. A toast. Oh, shit, you know what? I'm gonna take a cooking class. I heard you can bang some hot broads in cooking class. Is that right? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, wait. That's right, you got your girl, so Megan? Hey look, I want to talk to you about last night. About what? That thing with the big man's lady. Well? She was just mad 'cause I said I wouldn't drive her home. Uh-hmm. I don't know what it looked like from where you were standing. I just don't want you to get the wrong idea. How could I? Well you see a man, woman arguing. Yeah, arguin'. Like an old married couple. I just don't want you to think anything's goin' on. Like what? I just... I don't know how you perceived it. How I perceived it? How I perceived it. From my angle, it looked like you and the big man's wife were havin' a spat. It was about the driving. Okay. I just want to clear that up, okay? Okay, no problem. That's between you and the big man's wife. My lips are sealed. Thanks, man. Hey, Maxipad? If I were you, I'd be a lil' more sneakier than you're bein'. You know what I mean? Hey, go make us some nice toast, huh? Max? What is it now? We got to stop this. Stop what? Seth knows about us. He tell you that? In not so many words, but he knows, trust me. How do you know that? In his smug way, he was lettin' me know. He probably keeps tabs on you. He probably watches this place. I mean, how many times have I been here? He probably sees me comin' and goin'. Like tonight? I'm comin' over for a different reason. I just want you to understand that we have got to end this, for the sake of both of our lives. Look Max, you've been freaked out before, you'll get over it. No, no, Laurel. I mean it. I'm puttin' my foot down. This is it. - Oh, Max. - No, Laurel. We'll both be thankful that it ended now and not before somethin' really bad happens, you know? Well, what if I don't want it to end? Want, and what has to happen, are two completely different things. This is it. Look, let's just do what's right here. You're married. I wish you weren't, but you are. Max. Hang out for a sec, I'm gonna throw these in the trunk. Then I'm gonna come back and get you and we're outta here. I... I better take a piss before we go. - Hurry the fuck up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck. Vince, we got a problem! Fuck! It's Seth! Vince, it's Seth. Sent Max your way. Now it's your time to shine, kid, fuckin' show us what you got. All right, kid. You keep comin' to me for a job. All right? Well, today is your lucky day. What do ya got? Well, we got somethin' that's gonna test your mettle. Now, the boss man wants you there at eight o'clock. Eight o'clock. All right? On time is late, early is on time. Now, he'll give you all the details. You think you can do that? Yeah, I can do it. Just give me a goddamn job, I don't care what it is. We'll see about that. Hey Vince, don't be late. She's pretty. Daughter? Fuck you! That's my wife. - Daughter? - No, Mr. Pinero, I'm sorry. I don't mean any offense. I'm sorry. Take it from me, you're a very lucky man. Here, I wanna show you something. Go ahead, look at 'em! That is your fuckin' brother! I don't know what to say. I'm gonna ask you a question. It's a simple yes or no answer. Do you wanna work for me? Yes. Then will you kill these two treacherous pieces of shit for me? Hey! He just said, it was a simple yes or no answer. You want me to kill my own brother? And my wife. I want you to get close to my wife. Come here. What? I wanna talk to you. Okay. So talk. There isn't an easy way to say this. Laurel, what the fuck is this? I like you, Vince. Yeah, you like me? This is crazy, and it has to stop. What? No, wait. Baby, wait a second, what... what about our plans? Ugh, where would we go? Gino will come looking for me. Fuck, Gino. Come on. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Jesus Christ, Laurel. Why are you doing this? Come on, baby, don't do me like this, you're gutting me here. Come on, baby. No, no. Ugh. Vince. remember when you asked me if I knew your brother? Max? What about him? I know your brother. I knew him before I met you. I had an affair with him. I loved him. I still do. Vince, I got with you to make him jealous. Aren't you going to say anything? What do you want me to say, Laurel? Anything. Well, I don't have to say anything, when pictures say a thousand words. What are you talking about? I wanna show you somethin'. What is this? Go on, take a look. Gino knows, Laurel. He's always known. Ever since you two got together, he's known. Why do you have these? Vince, you're scaring me. It's okay, don't be scared. I want you to leave, Vince. I can't. I'm asking you to leave! Now! It's okay. Call Max, set up the meetin'. Tell him where he can find his brother. Not a problem, boss. Oh yeah, get rid of this trash. Max, yeah, it's Seth, we need to talk. No, I don't want to say over the phone. It's better in person. You got a few new messages. Seth out front? Um-hmm. I emptied it when you went to get the food. So what, you're workin' with Seth now? By way of Pinero. Why? Come on, Max. It's my time to shine. I was supposed to do this hours ago. I've just been. workin' up the nerve. This is a burn on me? Why? Pinero knows you been fuckin' his wife. He'd pictures of the two of you together. You should've seen Laurel's face when I showed 'em to her. I saw her heart literally skip a beat. And you killed her? She had to go. Those were the old man's orders. She didn't deserve that. Max, she sealed her fate a long time ago, way before she ever met you. Gettin' involved with a guy like Pinero? Now you're gonna kill me? Those are the orders, too. Vince, I came here to help you. Yeah, Seth knew that you would, it's his idea, figured you'd come to help out your poor ol' little brother. Well Max, I don't need your help anymore. I'm movin' up. And when you're gone, I'm takin' your place. Vince, you don't have to do this. I told you, you never helped me! I always asked you, but you never helped me! Now, I'm makin' my own way! You could make this easier for me, turn around. Fuck you, you wanna be a big man? Take your shot. Suit yourself. Fuck it. And you killed her. Max, she sealed her fate a long time ago. That I love you. I love you, too.
