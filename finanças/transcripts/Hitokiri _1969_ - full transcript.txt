SHOCHIKU FILMS, LTD KATSU PRODUCTIONS FUJI TELECASTING COMPANY Tosa Country - 1862 Tanizato Village Buy my armor. It's worth this much. Not interested. How about this much? It's worthless. Sensei... ...please help me. I'm deeply in debt! Creditors are hounding me! I have to sell my land and my samurai birthright! My troubles weigh down on me like a coffin on my head! And these damn Tosa Loyalists sitting on their butts! I want action! Action! Amano must have missed you. Master Takechi sent him to find you. He sent for me? But it's finally begun. Today we rise to kill Yoshida Toyo. Yoshida Toyo? The oppressor who rules this land, Yoshida Toyo. Go and watch how they do it. Sensei, I'm glad we're finally taking action, but how...? Your swordsmanship is in need of discipline. You fight like a wild animal. But you've never killed before tonight. You just watch. But you watch closely and learn how to kill a man. Watch and learn. Tenchu! Tenchu! Tenchu! Tenchu? Tenchu! Say it again... Tenchu! 'Heaven's Punishment'! Tenchu! Damn, I could do better than that! I could kill. I could kill. Just give me a chance. I'll kill. TENCHU Produced by GOSHA & KATSU Screenplay by HASHIMOTO SHINOBU Photography by MORITA FUJIO Art Direction by NISHIOKA YOSHINOBU Music by SATO MASARU Starring KATSU SHINTARO - Okada Izo - NAKADAl TATSUYA - Takechi Hanpei - MISHIMA YUKIO - Tanaka Shinbei - SHINJO TAKUMI BAISHO MITSUKO ISHIHARA YUJIRO - Sakamoto Ryoma - NAKAYA NOBURO Directed by HIDEO GOSHA Here come the Tosa Samurai. Takechi Hanpei looks great. Like a fierce dragon. It is said that they assassinated Yoshida Toyo. He lifts all the Tosa people. They're making a big splash, though they came here only recently. That's Okada Izo. He looks so proud. He is said to be as strong as Tanaka Shinbei. What a long sword! Who has Izo killed? Izo has killed seven or eight. Tanaka Shinbei may be a better swordsman, but Izo gets all the attention. Izo looks like a wolf. From Kyoto it's a hard journey to Ishibe. So if our best assistants will leave the night before. There are ten rooms in Ishibe. Four men are in them. We need to know which ones they're in. We'll know that by nightfall How many are there? There are three Kyoto Magistrates, Watanabe Genzaburo, Mori... ...plus their retainers. There will be 17 or 18 total. Who will mete out Heaven's Punishment? We can send Okada Izo of Tosa. Right. They will have a big fight. What about Tanaka Shinbei? Don't walk out of the action. We can count on you. There's another matter in Kyoto we must tend to first. Yes, Honma of Echigo. He's just a lone wolf. No problem. Tosa's Okada Izo will handle it. I'm Takechi Hanpei of Tosa. Can I speak to you today... ...regarding Honma of Echigo? Previously he was one of the few Loyalists from that province. He was our friend. A true pioneer. But now, we have come to doubt his intentions He keeps company with aristocrats. He sees the chance for money. He makes grand speeches, but wastes money on prostitutes. He's become a disgrace to the Loyalist's cause. Aren't you friends with Tanaka Shinbei? Yeah, he's a good guy. Why do you want him here? It would be great publicity. Publicity? Tanaka Shinbei is the most famous man in Kyoto... ...The next most famous man. Hey O-tani! You say Shinbei is more famous than me? What are you talking about? You and Shinbei are equal. You're both champions. Kawama from Higa is famous, too. But he hasn't killed as many as you have. Just by sitting here you attract customers. Fine, I'll bring him by one of these days. Any news? Welcome. Honma's been found. Drink? No thanks. You're too nervous to kill anybody. Put this on my tab. I'll charge it to your clan. Thank you. Honma, Tenchu! Tenchu! Sakamoto? We're mistaken! Honma isn't here! He's across town! Sorry, gotta go! Honma of Echigo? Okada Izo of Tosa? Draw your sword. Go down like a man. Why me? Did Takechi Hanpei order this? Tenchu! I thought I hit something hard. Nicked the blade. Nicked the blade? You did so well in such a narrow alley. Okada-san, teach me how to kill men like that. Say 'Heaven's Punishment'. Tenchu? Yeah, Tenchu. There's no other knack to it. Tenchu. Thank you very much. Look. Nicked the blade, eh? What's wrong? I have to send my sword to the polisher. I borrowed Master Takechi's. You have to use another man's sword, huh? Listen, Okada. A couple of suspicious Tosa samurai just showed up. Who? Inspectors Inishe and Iwasaki. They were asking about Yoshida Toyo... Their chief won't rest until he finds out who killed him. He's got a hunch, but can't prove anything. Now those two are sniffing around. Those two are undesirable persons for us. But, your sword is at the polisher's. Undesirable persons! Gimme a break! Why not just ask me to kill him? Idiot! Without me the Tosa Loyalists would be nothing! Matsuda, you're getting your second chance to do what? You know what. We keep going over the same subject. Why are you making Izo kill so many people? I understand your position. The Satsuma Clan came to Kyoto a day earlier than the Tosa. So you allied with Anjoku, the maddest of all the aristocrats. To compete with Tanaka Shinbei of Satsuma, Okada Izo kills too many people. Sakamoto! That's enough! You think more about yourself than other people. You used to be a Loyalist but now you're here. Takechi, are you going to have Okada Izo kill me too? I wouldn't order that, now. Anyway, I'd leave Kyoto if I were you. From our standpoint, you're nothing but a traitor. It's so hot. They will probably rot fast in this heat. The head and body exposed for public viewing. The sign said 'Honma of Echigo'. You said? Rumor has it that Tanaka Shinbei of Satsuma or Okada Izo of Tosa did it. Shinbei or me? But I know who it was. It was you. Why me? Because when you come here at noon, it means you worked the night before. And then you stay the night or longer. Again? We've got plenty of time. No, we don't. I'm going away. Away? Yeah, tonight. I'm taking the ferry to Osaka. Osaka? What for? Jerk! What are you laughing to yourself about? It's like a dream. The order is changing. Takechi will be a Feudal Lord with immeasurable wealth. Then, because I worked for him the hardest... Omino, if that comes true, I'll give you an easy life. You mean you'll marry me? No I can't do that. I'll buy you a house. You won't have to see anyone else. Then I'll just be a mistress. Are you engaged to someone? No not really. Brother is this the killer Okada Izo? How rude. Okada, please forgive my sister. The Princess has a strong character like her brother. Hey! Are you thinking about another woman, you drooling fool? She's a prize beyond my reach, but if I kill as many people as I can... ...then when I'm a hero in the New World Order... ...she may be a prize within my reach. What are you mumbling about you big headed man? A prize beyond your reach...! Damn you! You're such a pig after you've killed someone! So what? I've been waiting for you. Izo, come here. I'm busy. O-kami. We'll be in there. Let him pick a fight with you. But, today I've got this... I told you a poor craftsman... Just go ahead. All right. Have a drink. I have something important to tell you. Make it quick. I'm going out. Where? None of your business! Don't interfere! Izo why do you kill so many people? Sakamoto. Don't you understand anything? I do it for our nation! - For our nation? - That?s right! Will killing people help the nation? I don't want to argue. Takechi says so. Is Takechi always right? Yes he is! Just compare how I am right now with how I was in Tosa, and things are going to get even better! Where Takechi of Tosa goes, I will follow him! Izo, do you know the story of the hunter and his dog? The hunter and his dog chased animals all day in vain. My grandfather told me that story a million times. The hunter got mad and yelled at the dog. The dog ran faster until he found a rabbit. He attacked the rabbit furiously thinking it would please his master. But the dog bit into the rabbit's liver. It's bitter blood made the game inedible. Haste makes waste... Right? Heard it a million times! Izo, there's more to the story. More? Yes. The hunter got furious at the dog, killed him, and then boiled and ate him. Killed the dog? Boiled and ate him? I don't know that part. Sakamoto. Are you saying Takechi is a hunter and I'm his dog? Is the man with Izo walking? That's ridiculous! Listen you don't know what's going on here. The reason the Tosa Clan is so influential here in Kyoto is all because of me! Takechi treats me with respect. I'd kill for him! The Tosa Loyalists need me! You're a traitor. You're the one in danger. Worry about yourself first! Wait! I'm tired of your stupid talking. I'm busy! He's a good guy, but what a blockhead! What a blockhead! All that trusted logic! Never mind him! Put this on my tab. I'll charge it to the Tosa Clan. What about him? He's a Tosa man, more or less. Include. Thank you. Going out? Yeah, so...? Want a hand? No. The Tosa Clan will handle it. Just the Tosa Clan? I see. You know there are some things I, too must do by myself. When that happens. Don't get in my way. What are you talking about? There's a traitor named Sakamoto Ryoma. He's mine. O-kami, my bill. Okada paid. Wait! What's your name and clan? Tosa Clan, Sakamoto Ryoma. What do you want? So you're the one. From Satsuma, I'm Tanaka Shinbei. Call me 'Hito-Kiri' Shinbei. Satsuma's 'Killer' Shinbei. I'll remember that. Shinbei, Sakamoto is no traitor. He's a born scatterbrain. If people say right, he goes left. He's just a damn fool. You shouldn't take him too seriously. You Tosa people stick together. You even cover for traitors. Sakamoto isn't a traitor. I've known him since we were kids. He's a true Loyalist. He introduced me to Takechi. He'd never betray us. I guarantee it. Shinbei try to be understanding. Well, I wonder about him. The wind is picking up. The men on the Osaka Ferry will be happy to get inside. Matsuda. I'm taking Izo off the Ishibe squad. Why? The four clans will raid Ishibe without Okada Izo. Why? He's our best fighter... Tosa has gone too far! We originally invited you here to act as a buffer between the bickering Satsuma and Choshu clans. But instead you've become the most hard-headed! Takechi, The Emperor is very unhappy! In the name of Heaven's Punishment, Izo kills too many! He's become a royal headache! So the Emperor has issued an Imperial Edict, calling your Lord Yamamoto to Kyoto. Yoshida was his favorite. The death infuriated him. Plus, he hates anything radical. He can't stand Izo's killing. Chances are, he might even send us all back to Tosa. I see now. I get it. If Izo kills at Ishibe Tosa will be blamed again. So that's why you took him off the squad. Izo has done a good job. After he takes care of Inouye, let him rest for a while. Seems Loyalists have their own problems. Let's go drink some more. I'll tell you all about it. I've had enough. No more. Let's go. I've had enough. Oh, come on. I can't drink anymore. Good night. Inouye you're about to find out who killed Yoshida Toyo. Ask him yourself in the hereafter. Izo, you're a brilliant killer. You can do it any time, any place. Even in broad daylight. Yeah, but I slipped up yesterday. I forgot to say Tenchu. What a joker! Master, take a look at my sword. It's as good as new. By the way, about the Ishibe raid on Watanabe and his men... When is it? It's been postponed. We're putting it off for a while. You've worked hard. Take a rest. A rest? Might be a good idea in this heat. I love octopus. Yeah, it's all squishy when you chew it. I couldn't afford it a few years ago. But I'm rich now, and everything keeps getting better. Heaven's reward. Excuse me. This is from Sakamoto. He's waiting for you downstairs. Thanks. Thank you. Sorry to bother you. Come here! I'm eating. Eat after I'm done. We can do it later. I can't wait until later. You shouldn't screw before work. Why not? You're a killer. You'll sweat out all of your strength. What? Are you sure about this? If Leader Takechi finds out... Why would they tell Takechi? Just tell them you brought me along on his orders. That's the only reason they'd see you. Just open your eyes and look at yourself. Consider Japan's domestic situation. 'Kedamono'! Beast, huh? Yes, you are. Your body is unusual. Stop it! Don't! Stop it! Bitch! Your body is mine! I'll do as I please. Don't brag! What? I was having a nice dream. So what? I spend all my money on you! It's the least you can do! It's the least I can do, huh?! Then spare me all the hot air about Okada Izo of Tosa! What? You talk big, but all you can buy is a cheap whore like me! Tell your Leader to pay you enough for a fancy courtesan! How much I get paid is none of your business! I bought your body! I can do as I please! Idiot! With money? Is that so? That's fine! Do as you like! Bitch! They left. For Ishibe? Last night? I waited for you all night at the meeting place, but you didn't come. When I said I'd find you, they left me behind. Damn them! They left me out! They left me out! The raid will start this evening and Ishibe is too far. It's too late! Out of the way! Move, or Okada Izo of Tosa will kill you! Okada Izo is here! I am Okada Izo! I am Okada Izo of Tosa! Watanabe Genzaburo? Okada Izo? I'm Okada Izo! Okada-no-Izo! Okada Izo is here! It's Okada Izo! I am Okada Izo! Where is Okawara? Are you Okawara? I killed Watanabe Genzaburo! I'm a dedicated Loyalist! My name is Okada Izo! Okada Izo has killed them! Tenchu, that's all. You yelled out your clan's name and your own name, too! You know that you must never reveal that even under torture. But, Leader... Why did you leave me out? I, Takechi Hanpei so ordered! You will follow my orders, or I'll send you back home! Be more discreet. What about my pay? You dare ask for money? What unbelievable gall! Idiot! Welcome. Okada-san. You're earlier than usual. Sake. You look depressed, Izo. What's wrong? Listen, I want you to do me a favor. That aristocrat? No, thanks to you. I can visit him anyway. The problem is you. What's that? At Ishibe, you and Tanaka Shinbei killed so many. You made the other clans look bad, the show you two put on. Now they are trying to kill me. That's not my problem. Look, I don't care who is after me. But there is someone else who must not be killed. I have to go to Hyogo tonight, leaving him alone. Will you be his bodyguard for me just for tonight? Who is he? It's Katsu. Give me a break! He's a Shogunate supporter with Masamoto. Leader Takechi is mad at me. Why's Takechi mad at you? Never mind. It's none of your business. - Hey! Waitress! - Yes! Let's go outside. Izo, why do you kiss Takechi's rear end all the time? Takechi Hanpei this, Takechi Hanpei that. Okada Izo delivers. Guarding Katsu will benefit Takechi Hanpei, too. Leader Takechi will benefit? That's right, he will. Thanks for your trouble. Am I really in such big danger? I don't see any monsters or wolves around. Let's go. The Choshu Clan is furious! They went for Katsu last night but his bodyguard killed 2 of them! One fellow that got away said the Yojimbo looked exactly like Izo! I told him that he is surely mistaken. Izo, was it really you? Yes, it was. Why did you do such a thing? Because Sakamoto asked me. Sakamoto asked you? You did it just because that traitor asked you to? He said guarding Katsu would benefit Leader Takechi. What exactly did Sakamoto say? Takechi is plotting to overthrow the Shogunate and restore the Emperor to power, in order to become a Daimyo Lord. - Good, I'll rise with him. - No, you won't. Why not? There will be no Daimy? in the New Age. Farmers, merchants and samurai... ...All will be equal. Nonsense! You're dreaming. It will never happen. If it does happen, the Loyalists will only end up replacing the Shogun with the Emperor. What good will that do? Absurd! And you believed him? No, I didn't. For some unknown reason Leader Takechi is mad at me about Ishibe. He didn't even pay me. I thought I was doing good. I'll do anything to regain his favor. And I do like one thing you said... What's that? If the world changes like you said, then we'll be equal with aristocrat's daughters. It's none of your business, though. I like the idea. I've killed so many for our nation. It might be fun for a change... not to kill anyone! Izo, you don't understand a thing! You fool! You God-damn idiot! Idiot? It's okay if you just do what I tell you to do, and don't do what I don't tell you to do! Do you have a problem with that? I guess... Dissatisfied, are you? Then go home to Tosa! At once if you don't want to do what I order you to! I'm not your dog! Don't talk big! What? 'Do what I tell you, and don't do what I don't tell you to do!' Who do you think you are? I'm a true Loyalist! Screw you! I won't go to Tosa! Plenty of people would love to hire me. From now on, you're no longer my Leader! I'm leaving you! Bastard! He can't talk to me like that! He's nothing without me! I am Okada Izo. I'm trying to find work as an assassin. If you want to hire me, make an offer. Speaking for Choshu Clan, I'd like to hire you right now, but I have to check with my supervisor. Let me get back to you. We checked with Tosa. They said they decided to send you home because you caused such a ruckus. That's absurd! Whatever. Bottom line, if we hire you now, it might cause trouble between us and Takechi, and we don't want that. Tanaka Shinbei, and Okada Izo. We'd be the strongest clan. Are you sure you've left Takechi? Yes. Takechi Hanpei and I had a clean break. Tosa Clan is nothing to me. Nothing. Takechi was very clear. He's not letting you go. He's just blowing smoke. He doesn't own me. Look, I want you here, but we don't want any trouble. Especially not with the famous Takechi Hanpei. Like I told you, the Kumamoto Clan must avoid any trouble with Takechi. Please don't take it personally. Of course, I can't afford to hire you, but I'm a noble man. I don't need your services. You should put away your sword. The best thing for you is to go home and farm. With Okada Izo gone, Kyoto will probably quiet down a bit. But you can never leave Takechi. I can! I'll never go back to him! Never! Sake! Bring more sake! Okada Izo is here. Mr. Okada, you better stop drinking. What? Takechi of Tosa came a few days ago. He said that Okada Izo's bill won't be paid by the Tosa Clan anymore. You have to pay for your sake yourself. What! Sit down. Shinbei! Drink. I won't say anything. Takechi won't pay your tab anymore? What a jerk! We should help each other. I'll pay for your drinks anytime. Shinbei, oh, you're a great guy. I... I know. I know. Don't say anything. Let me talk. Let me speak. Let me get it off my chest! I am such a fool! Damn. Takechi told me, 'Kill that one for the sake of the nation'. He'd say, 'Spare him'. Every time, Izo go right, Izo go left... What should I do now? What am I? A damn fool! What is Okada Izo? A giant-size fool! It's your own fault. My fault, why? There are some things you just can't change. Do you know how much I owe? Thirty ryo! Thirty ryo? No matter how hard I work, I'll never get out of debt! Once you're bound by money... No, you're wrong. You and I are the same. I'm tied to money. You're tied to the Tosa Clan and Takechi. We're both tied down, unable to move. There's nothing we can do about it. But, I owe so much. Let's go to bed. No, damn you! Tomorrow you apologize to Takechi. No! If you apologize... No way! I can't do that, unless... If you really have changed your mind, that's very good. For me as well as for all the Tosa Loyalists. I'll never oppose you again. That's enough. You don't have to beg. By the way, there's a very undesirable person I want you to take care of. This job is top secret. I want you to do it alone. Leader, it's not Sakamoto, is it? Izo, you impress me. You have a sixth sense. Don't worry. It's not Sakamoto. I'd never ask you to kill Sakamoto. Leader. You're mean! You made me sweat. Tell me who it is. I'll kill him at once. Anenokoji. What's wrong? Why so shocked? But, Anenokoji-sama is our strongest ally. Izo, didn't you just swear to do exactly as I ordered from now on? Now, listen... There's a trick to this job. Don't use your own sword. Use this. After you're done, leave it near the body. This design, It's a Satsuma sword. I've seen this before. Tanaka Shinbei of Satsuma. How did we get Shinbei's sword? No one will ever know. Hundreds of years from now people will still wonder what happened? It will be an unsolvable mystery. But Leader... Why must I use Shinbei's sword to kill Anenokoji-sama? I won't tell you. You wouldn't understand anyway. You swore you'd do exactly as ordered! So do it! It's you...? Okada-san! Okada-san! Anenokoji was assassinated! Okada-san! Leader Takechi went to see what happened! Okada-san, please! Anenokoji has been assassinated! That nobleman has been killed! Okada-san get up! Who did this? This is a great setback for our nation. Who did it? Who could have done such a thing? I'm sorry about the other day. It was Tosa Clan's orders. I had no choice. Forgive me. Apparently Anenokoji was killed by Tanaka Shinbei of Satsuma. Shinbei's been summoned to the Magistrate. If I, Tanaka Shinbei did it, I'd say so. That Nobleman Anenokoji was a Loyalist. He was one of us. Why would I kill him? So you deny the charges? Whose sword is that? It's mine. It was found next to the body of Nobleman Anenokoji! Next to the body? That's right. The Emperor wasted no time in expelling the Satsuma Clan. We got rid of Anenokoji, that nobleman was starting to go soft, and banished the Satsuma Clan from Kyoto all in one stroke. What a brilliant plan! But what happened to Izo? He fled without finishing Anenokoji off. And he hasn't even come for his pay. He's only human. I suppose his work gets to him sometimes. Pay him double this time. Izo, wake up! Izo wake up! This isn't like you. You fell asleep the moment you came in. You look like a crying child. You're making me sad, too. We're coming in! Who's here? Okada is. Which clan? State your name! Wake up! He's drunk and asleep. Please leave him alone. Shut up and let me do my job! Wake up! What's going on? Ronin Patrol. State your name and clan! Ronin Patrol? Leave me alone, dogs! What's that? Go away! Why must I tell you my name and clan? Get up! What are you in for? What are you in for? Hey, can't you hear me? What are you in for? Tell us! Tell us! You look like a samurai. Ronin Patrol get you? I'm no ronin! You are aware you can't be arrogant in here. Are you an arrogant samurai? This damn splinter. We don't like samurai in here! They are too arrogant! Tell us now, arson? Robbery? What? He looks stupid! Maybe he's a petty thief? Pay your respects to the Boss or we'll beat you up! Sounds good! Try and get me, all of you! I'm Okada Izo of Tosa! Warden! My clan will get me out of here! It's dark and it's stinky! Hey! Let me wait in the Magistrate's room! Warden! I explained everything to the Aizu Inspectors. I'm a Tosa man, Okada Izo! If you mess with me, my Tosa brothers will come and chop off your heads! They say they'll release Okada Izo, if it's really him. That's what the Aizu Clan messenger said. Damn fool! Shall we send someone for him? No, wait. I'll go myself. Aizu Clan is up to something fishy. I'll bring Okada Izo back. I'm impressed! This is my turn now. You pour me some. Huh, thanks. Now I can brag that I shared a cup with a big Tosa samurai! Anything you need, just ask. Stay as long as you like! It won't be too much longer! Ah, here they come. Here I am! Okada Izo is over here! Is this man Okada Izo? Hey! What's the matter with you guys? It's me! Okada Izo! Well, is he Okada Izo or isn't he? Hey, Amano... Hey! It's me! It's Okada Izo! Hey! Hey! Leader Takechi! Oh... He even knows my face and name. He's a good actor. Takechi Hanpei, I'll ask again. Is this man Izo? No, that is not Okada Izo. Leader! This man is not Okada Izo. He is not from Tosa Clan. Okada Izo is a famous swordsman. He would not get drunk, or go to brothels, or fight officials and get thrown in jail! He's not like that! I've never seen this man before now. He's only pretending to be Okada Izo. An imposter! Leader! Get me out of here! Takechi certainly lives up to his reputation. He thought we'd picked up Okada Izo on a routine Ronin Patrol. I wondered if we should torture him to make him talk. But, there's no need for that. He's not Okada Izo from Tosa He's just nobody from nowhere. But, he at least needs a name. How about... 'Torazo'? It sounds stronger. From now on, you're just a vagrant called Torazo! Tosa Country - 1865 Did 8 months in jail teach you a lesson? You're free. You were granted a special pardon on the condition that you stay out of Kyoto forever. Hey, Okada. Izo! I tried to get you out sooner, but there were problems. The world has changed a lot since you were put away. Takechi and the other Loyalists were recalled to Tosa. And that's not all. The Lord still wants to know who killed Yoshida Toyo. Takechi and Matsuda are being interrogated at the castle. There's no point in going home now. Seems stupid to struggle amongst ourselves when we're surrounded by English and Dutch warships. I'm determined to unite Satsuma and Choshu. Hey, Izo... Why don't you come with me to Kyushu? Come and see me when you get out. I'm in Sanjo. All right? Okada! Hey, Okada! Have you decided? This is the third time. I want an answer today. Tosa chiefs have nothing to punish Takechi for. He'll get out soon, and the Loyalists will come back to power. But the chiefs are sure to send people after you, They're still looking for evidence against Takechi. If you're caught, they'll keep you. Matsuda and Takechi are in jail during the investigation. The longer it takes, the more our plans unravel. It's not just for Matsuda, Takechi, and the Loyalists. It's for your sake, too. We'll pay your expenses. Just stay out of Tosa for six, no, three months. Please, please. I beg you! I'm not Okada Izo. I'm Torazo the Vagrant. That fool! He still bears a grudge against us! He's left us no choice. I'll take care of him. We could have used him again after our release. You no longer need a dog like him. From this point on, the real killing begins. ...War... ...Rising Flames... ...Swirling Smoke... ...Rivers of Blood... One dog like Okada Izo isn't enough! We'll need thousands of mad dogs! From small destruction to the final complete destruction! It's been some time. Tomorrow is the Spring Festival. It's good to see you. My family runs a brewery. They make good sake. Here. Have some. You drink it. What? You drink it first. I don't trust Takechi. See, it's not poison. Now do you trust me? No. One more cup. It seems all right. You're paranoid. You suspect even me. Anybody would be paranoid after what I've been through. What will you do now? After what happened in Kyoto, I've severed my ties there. Nothing to do with you. Anyway, I'm leaving Tosa after the festival. Leaving? Sakamoto is coming here. I'm going to Kyushu with him. You never know what could happen. I'm going to be his bodyguard. But I won't be his dog. I'm no longer Okada Izo. I'm Torazo the Vagrant, and I'll stay that way. Minakawa, that's because in Kyushu everybody is free! From now on, I'll live as I wish. What's wrong? Okada-san... Do you feel okay? That's odd... What's wrong? The sake is poisoned. Takechi told me. Wait a minute! It's a lie! It's not poison. He told me I had to convince you, no matter what. It's a trick. He said it just to encourage me. No, Takechi is inhumane. No he's not! He will save Tosa, and renew Japan. Yoshida Toyo's assassination! Are you saying that you know who planned and carried it out? Who was it? I won't tell you for free. Give me a reward. Reward? What are you talking about? Money. Thirty ryo. Done. Now tell me who did it. I won't breathe a word until I get paid. Thirty ryo to be sent to Omino at the Yamashiro Inn. Right? Yes, at the Yamashiro House. Make sure it gets there. We'll send it off at once. Okay. Write a letter, too. A short one. Yes. "Omino, use this money to free yourself. "I, too, will free myself... "...from the one who tied me down." Sir Yoshida Toyo was assassinated on the orders of Takechi Hanpei? Izo, these are the names of the assassins, is that correct? Exactly. And the one who strangled Inspector Inouye Seiichiro... ...was me. What? Those were Takechi's orders, too. There were more, many, many more. Detectives Bunkishi, Muru, and Tada. Classical scholar Kuyo... Honma of Echigo... Watanabe Genzaburo and Okawara... and don't be surprised... Anenokoji the Nobleman, Tanaka Shinbei of Satsuma. I killed them all on Takechi's orders with this sword! Okada Izo, you've killed so many people for no reason. For that you shall be crucified! Today's the Spring Festival. I have plans to see someone. Execute me after I say good-bye to him. No! Izo! Okada! Izo! Okada! Any last words? One question... Will Takechi and I... ...be executed... ...for the same charge? His are political crimes. Yours are a ruffian's crimes. Different deaths to differentiate them. He'll be allowed to commit seppuku. You are to be crucified like this. I see. It went better than I thought. I'm free at last! Free? I cut my ties with Takechi in this world. So he will be nothing to me in the next world. Do it! THE END
