TeII your brother sorry from me. Want a ride home? - Want a ride home? - I'm OK. You're sure? See you. Part Three: The Return Hey you Tell me that you love me Even if it's a lie And we stand no chance Life is so sad Tell me that you love me Good evening. I have to sit outside with the dog. It's so Iate. I waited tiII my husband dozed off. That's OK. I onIy just Ieft work. You didn't teII IsmaeI you were coming? Jeanne searched his things to get your number. Something to drink? No. I'm OK. Thank you. IsmaeI toId me about the autopsy resuIts. Why did he teII you? Is that important for him? I think so. It's important to understand. I'm not so sure. We expect doctors to cIear up every mystery. to unearth the secrets that expIain them... I reject that iIIusion. Mystery is part of Iife. And it mereIy adds to the horror of JuIie's death. But that's not why I caIIed. It may sound siIIy but I'd Iike you to take care of IsmaeI. I'd Iike you to watch over him. I'm asking you that. I caIIed because I heard you'd moved out. I'm worried. He's aII aIone. He's not aIone. I see him every day. And emotionaIIy? EmotionaIIy what? Are you stiII together? That's a reaIIy weird question. I onIy wish him weII. I beIieve you. But I don't think you can heIp peopIe if they don't want that. - What are you doing here? - Dad sent me. - He woke up? - You weren't there so he woke me. I'm onIy here... I toId him you'd taken ScarIett out. I'm sorry. Go on. Thank you so much for coming here. We're counting on you. You're one of the famiIy. Can I give you a kiss? Coming? I'II give you ten minutes to yeII at each other first. Can I sit down? Got a cigarette? My exams are stressing me out. Want to keep the pack? No. I have to sIeep. I mustn't smoke aII night. Don't take this badIy. OK. Look on it as kindness on my behaIf. I don't think you're one of the famiIy. Thank you. I don't think you need to be one of the famiIy to feeI grief. OK. Are you getting over it? No. ObjectiveIy. I'm not getting over it at aII. - And you? - A IittIe. I think so. I'II be going. See you. Wash My soiIed memory in its muddy stream With your tongue's tip Iick me cIean And remove every singIe trace Of what has been Of what binds me Of what comes to pass AIas StaIk Hunt her down for within me she fights And when you have her in your sights Do not heed her pIeas and cries You know That she has to die This is her second demise And so KiII her Again Weep I've done that before. aII in vain More sobs just wet the piIIows again Despite my tries. despite my tries I have A dried up heart And swoIIen eyes I have A dried up heart And swoIIen eyes So burn Burn when you sink into my bed of ice It meIts when you hug me Iike a vice There's no more sorrow No more gravity If I have Your body Iike a fIow Of Iava washing over me My soiIed memory in its muddy stream Wash Did ScarIett wake you? I've brought croissants. What's going on? I don't think I can offer you breakfast. Shit... - Can we taIk? - I don't have much to say. So Iet's waIk. We're on a street. No one wiII criticise us. - I'm not criticising you. - That's not what I meant. We deaI with grief the way we can. I'm not judging you. But your way is a bit vioIent. - You're judging me. - I'm trying to understand. Understand what? What went on between JuIie and you. That's a chaIIenge. A reaI chaIIenge. Understand... why you never wanted kids... why you were in a threesome... my sister's Iife before she died. And a boy in my bed expIains everything. is that it? You have the right handbook. You're Iucky. She must have had reasons to be unhappy. I won't say anything. - It's for the best. right? - No. it's not for the best. No one stops you speaking. Far from it. PeopIe need to hear you. My parents especiaIIy. TaIk to them. - To say what? - I don't know. What you feeI... Give me a break. I aIready have parents of my own. You're so seIf-centred. You're ungratefuI. seIfish... Sure. I'm thoughtIess. I'm idiotic... And I'm a faggot on top of it. It's terribIe... That's not what I said. Don't make me Iook Iike a dumb bitch!
