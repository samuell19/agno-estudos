Welcome to JFKlnternatlonal Alrport. Fllght 1607 from Nantucket wlll now depart from Gate 11A. Hello? - Hi, Mom. - Chloe, welcome home! - You are home right? - Yep, safe and sound. Your brother has been bouncing offthe walls. I can't walt to see hlm. So is everything set for Dad's surprise party? Honey, I'm afraid your Dad's not gonna be here when you get home. What? Why not? Mom, what happened? He got called in to work. Did you tell him I was coming? Yeah, honey, I did. But... they called this morning and... What's his flight? It's... Ah, London. 335. Honey, he's really sorry. Tell Raymie I'll be home before supper. Thank you. Thanks. There you go. You must feel like you've seen it all. You seem to be in the middle of a new disaster every time I turn on the news. Well, what is the old adage? It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it. Can I ask you a question, Mr. Williams? Yeah, sure. - Do you read the Bible? - Well... I'm guessing not as often as you do. Well, Matthew24, verse 7 says that there shall be famines, pestilence... and earthquakes in diverse places. All ofthese things, the disasters, the wars, they are all signs. So God knewthat all these things were going to happen? - Honey, God knows everything. - So then why doesn't He do something? I mean, He is God right? Couldn't He stop the flood if He wanted to? - Maybe send a little rain... - God created it perfect... and we destroyed it with the first sin. Who destroyed it? Me? You? Him? - The Lord works... - In mysterious ways, I know. But somehowpeople keep believing that He loves them. Nowthat is mysterious. Sorry to interrupt. Going my way? I enjoyed your speech. - Yeah, sorry about that. - No, don't be. That was really good. I'm assuming it's not your first time making it. Well, first time out loud. Cameron Williams. Buck, to my friends. I'm Chloe Steele. Chloe, to my friends. So, you're in college? Wow, that investigative journalism really pays off. Ljust wanted to say thank you for rescuing me from that nutty lady. Well, thank my Mom. She's who I've been rehearsing for. - Oh, is she... pretty... - Nutty? Actually, I was looking through the thesaurus on my phone this morning... and I've decided to go with wacko. "Wacko"? I like that word. "Wacko". Can I buy you a coffee? No... No, I'm fine. Come on. What if I throwin one ofthose fantastic little boXes with the strawberry jam? - Oh my gosh. That is, that's tempting. - Yes. But, I'm, I'm waiting for someone and he should be here any minute. My Dad. I flewhome to surprise him for his birthday... but something came up, so... I can't wait to... Did you steal my hat? You're killing me. Oh, you're slaying me. Well, have a safe flight. Hi, sweetheart! Hi! What are you doing here? Well, I came home to surprise you on your birthday. Honey, ljust got called in. There's no way I can get out ofthis now. - Yep, that's what Mom said. - I wish you would have told me... you were coming. Wait, you're Cameron Williams. Holy cow. - So, you two... - Oh, wejust met. - Hi. It's a pleasure, Captain. - Ray. Well, I'm gonna let you two catch up. And it was really nice to meet you, Chloe. - You look great. - Thank you. Let's talk. - How's school? - It's good. Good. What? You knowthe first thing I thought when Mom told me you weren't gonna be home? - That you'd left. - No. I mean really left. Just packed up your bags, slammed the doors... squealed the tires, andjust drove off. Your Mom and I are fine, Chloe. It's okay. I don't blame you. You don't blame me for what? For running away. But I didn't run away. You said you thought I ran away. Who's that girl? What girl? That flight attendant? The beautiful, blond one? Flight attendant. I work with dozens of flight attendants. Don't even knowher name. Lfthis were a year ago, you know, before Mom drank the Kool-Aid... you'd be home right now. We would all be home, like a family or something. Chloe, I think you knowthat... Mom and I got married when we were both very young. And the changes that a person goes through between 20 and 50 are enormous. She's just doing what she believes is right... and, maybe, you should cut her some slack. Me? What about you? I mean, you're the one on your way to London. You're the one who has not been home since Christmas. - I have school. - And I have ajob. Ljust feel like she's always trying to shove it down my throat. I know. Look, I knowthat this past year has been something of an adjustment... but she's your mother and I think it would be good if you... no, if we both, could be a little more supportive. Bet you miss her. Yes, I do. But hey, if she's gonna run offwith another man, why not Jesus? Where's your ring? It's in my car. I never wear it when I fly. Chloe, your Mom means the world to me. I'm not gonna do anything to mess that up, okay? I have to go. We'll talk when I get back. Not gonna be here when you get back. But you're gonna be back home again soon, right? Here. Car's in the usual spot. And go easy on Mom. She'll come around. I love you. You okay? Oh. Yeah. Yep. I'm fine. - EXcuse us. - Stop! Investigativejournalist, remember? Right. Yeah. Thanks. So? Just a little disappointed, that's all. This was a big deal to me. All of us together, having a good time. Well, I'm sure he would have stayed if he could. So the turkey... vulture comes up to the gate and drops two dead rabbits onto the floor. The flight attendant says: "I'm sorry, you're only allowed one carry-on". I'm sorry, Captain, that's bad. Hattie thought it was funny. Well, if you have any more badjokes you can come and find me. Hey, Marcus, they get that computer problem figured out? Negatlve that, Pan Con. Apparently... some of the equlpment on the fllght deck Is out dated. Yeah, and you have me flying east. In siX hours' time, I'll be nine hours older. Do thatfor about slX years and maybe you'll catch up to me. Happy Blrthday, buddy. Have a good fllght. Thanks. Sounds like that's all your Mom talks about. It seems like it sometimes. How does someone see an earthquake on the news and then try... to convince everyone that it's a good thing? Does that even make sense to you? The day after the tsunami there was this one woman, Medina... and she lost three of herfour children in that wave. Dragged out to sea while she watched. It was all she could do to hold onto a tree and a siX week old baby in her arms. Yeah, but she was so sure that God had saved her and the baby... that she went straight to her knees and she thanked Him. Did she thank Him for killing the others? She didn't get the chance. That night she refused to leave forthe evacuation. I mean, after all, God was watching over her. - And? - Mud slide. Buried the whole village underten feet of slime. How do people see something like that andjust... If you look hard enough, you'll see whatever it is that you're looking for. Now, you might have to ignore a lot of otherthings to do it... and one ofthem... might be the truth. And what about you? What did you see in that village? I sawa lot of people who had lost everything that had ever mattered. Did you ask why? I knowwhy. Atsunami. You knowwhat I mean. Then no, no I didn't. If you have to find a reason for something like that to happen then... Well, you might end up yelling strangers in the airport. Love that laugh. What? I wasjust thinking about Ray'sjoke. That guy cracks me up. Ray? You mean Captain Steele? Only in front of other people. Really? So you two are... Well... No. Not yet. But we're planning on spending some time together in London. Really? Why didn't you tell me? Hey wait, where are you going? Ah, some details please. I really needed someone to talk to today. Thank you. I'm gonna call you from London. - Really? - Really. Well, I gotta make sure you don't forget about me, alright? Right. Well I'm sure you have a girl in every airport, do you call all ofthem? None of them actually. Chloe! Oh, hi, Jim. I got these tickets for your Dad. They're for tomorrownight. U2. Wow! Those can't be easy to get. You're telling me. Took two weeks to find these things. Two weeks? Chloe, I'm sorry. Mr. Williams, please. I'm coming, I'm sorry. Chloe I... Will you give these to my Dad, please? Of course. You... - EXcuse me, here you go. - Thank you. - Mr. Williams, please. - Sorry! EXcuse me, Captain. Chloe asked me to give you this. Hey, you're the GWN guy right? GWN guy, yeah, that's me. Cameron Williams, Chris Smith. - Hey, nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. Welcome aboard PanCon Flight 2-5-7 to London. Flight time today will be siX hours and thirty minutes. Thank you and enjoy yourflight. So, you get her number? Come on, I sawyou two in the lounge about an hour ago. And nowyoujust happen to be the last person getting on the plane. And to think... I could have spent the last hour with you instead. I don't knowwhy you on-camera guys are always the ones that get the girls. Maybe because we don't walk around looking like a dress rehearsal for "Glee". You know, I'll let you have that one. Only as a thank you though for hooking a brother up with first class. Ah, no need to thank me. But the guy you were gonna sit beside back there nowhe should. I knowyou. Look, George. - It's Frank Sinatra. - What's that? It's Frank... Oh, listen, George. We're home. Home? We're not home. Sometimes he gets a bit confused. Good afternoon. Thls Is your Captaln, Rayford Steele... on fllght PanCon 2- 5-7. The weather condltlons are reported to be good... so It wlll be a nlce smooth fllght all the way to London. Please slt back and enjoy our eXcellent servlce. We wlll be servlng compllmentary drinks and snacks shortly... so please slt back and relaX. No, Johnny, you don't have to tell them anythlng. Just do whatyou do best. Stall 'em. But if you see one thing... that makes you think they smell an acquisition, ditch it all. Please turn off and stow away all electronlc devlces. Look, I left the company jet in Houston, I'll be in London... with the papers signed before they knowl'm gone. Well go, get. Adlos, good. PanCon 2- 5-7, you are cleared for takeoff. Chloe! Chloe! Hey! Come here! Oh gosh! My goodness, you're so big. Okay. Did you get me anything at the airport? Well, you'll just have to wait and see. All right, check it out in there, see what you got. The brand newbaseball glove that I've been asking for. No way. Mom, Chloe's here. Mom, Chloe's here! She's here, Mom. Hi, honey! Oh, my gosh. Oh, you look beautiful. So... - can I get you something to drink? - Yeah, yeah. Sure. Mom, Chloe got me a brand newbaseball glove, see? SiX hours to London. We'll be laughing at that soon. The hyperjet, it'll change everything. Oh yeah? Why's that? The Defense Department... Did you say the Defense Department? Yeah. It seems they've been developing a newjet. Okay? Lt'll carry 300 passengers at Mach 40. New York to London in siX minutes. - SiX minutes? - SiX minutes. - That's pretty fast. - Personally, I think they're lying. I think that's a good guess. There's, there's no way they developed it themselves. I'm guessing they reverse engineered it from something else. Probably something from Area 51. Scotch, please! So was your Dad surprised? Yeah, yeah, I'd say he was. Must've meant a lot to him. He seemed very upset that he had to leave. I could tell. - So howwas your flight? - It was good. Yeah, it was good. - And school? - It's fine. Hey, you'll never guess who I met at the airport. Buck Williams. Or, sorry, Cameron Williams. - From the news? - Yeah! Really? Did you get a chance to talk to him? I did, actually, and he is a great guy. Just so happens to be gorgeous. I told him you were a fan. Yeah, and, by the way, you're not the only one who thinks... every earthquake could be the end ofthe world. Some crazy lady cornered him in the airp... That's not howl meant that. Anyway... he's a great guy. Chloe, honey... I don't mean to push. I knowit must feel that way. Ljust want you to understand. This is important to me and so are you. - Ljust want you to be ready. - Ready for what? Nevermind. Can wejust talk without you cutting me off? Mom, ljust got here. I'm not really up for a heavy conversation. Okay sure, but just hear me out. Just a little. I've been praying for you to come home. And I believe that that is why God brought you here. What did you say? God brought me home? God did not bring me home. I brought me home. I bought the ticket, I got on the flight. God had nothing to do with it. And let me ask you something, if God brought me home for Dad's birthday... then why did he let him fly offto London? Maybe because it's important for us to talk. I don't think so. One thing I do knowfor sure... God is the reason Dad is not here right now. Chloe! Be right back. - Can I give you a hand with your bag? - Did I ask for a hand? I can put it on top foryou. Yeah, so could I. What are you looking at? You wanna ask me a question? Wanna knowhowl drive? Maybe where I buy my clothes? - Howdo I reach the urinal? - What's a urinal? That's my Dad. He plays football. That's nice, kid. He's gonna be on TVtomorrow ifhis throwing arm's all better. Your Dad plays ball on TV? What team? Gooooo Jets! Oh, what's wrong with his arm? Cozmo, he's my dog. He knocked Daddy offthe hammock. Oh, really? Daddy was so mad, he pushed Cozmo in the pool. Katie! What did I tell you about bothering the other passengers? Sorry. So, you're a bettin' man. Yep! You gonna give the kid a cut? Her Dad's P.K. Carvell. I doubt she needs the money. - Where are you going? - Out. - Can I come? - Raymie, not now. Please! - All right. Get your stuff. - Awesome. - Can we go to the mall? - Yes, we can. I heard there's an 80ol off sale at GameStop. - Do you think Mom's crazy? - What? No, I wasjust upset. Dad said Pastor Bruce was washing her brain. Oh, that'sjust ajoke. It is? - I don't get it. - Neither do I. So this must kinda suck. - What's that? - Having to fly on your birthday. Well, you gotta pay the bills right? So howlong's Chloe in town? Well, looks like smooth sailin'. I think I'll stretch my legs... and see howthe crew's doing. Raymie? What are you trying to do, scare me to death? - Come on! - Can I have it? - No! - It's only a fewhundred dollars. I got 'em. I am gonna find a way to pay you back. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Ljust thought that the seats would be a little closer to the stage. Coffee? She'll be okay. Mom. She still wears that necklace, you know? The one you made her. She nevertakes it off. They're gonna be all right, right? Mom and Dad. Yeah... Yeah, course. Dadjust got called into work, there's nothing he could do, okay? Did Dad tell you about my game? Are you kidding me? You're all we talked about. He said that you were the greatest baseball player in the whole world. - And you knowwhat? - What? He's right. - I love you. - I missed you, buddy. Katlel Help. Katlel - Have you seen my daughter? - Please sit down. - I don't knowwhere she is! - You need you to sit down. Chris, let me in! Raymie! - Where is she? - Sit down and put your seatbelt on. Put your seatbelts on now! Everyone sit down. My baby! I'm going to find out what's going on. Who's coming with me? I'll go with you. Let's go get some answers. I want to see this Captain.

This is PanCon 2-5-7, we have an emergency. Mayday. Mayday. This is PanCon heavy 2-5-7. Acknowledge? I dropped the pressure to get them to sit; it's okay now. Everyone on this plane is scared to death. I really need you to step up here, Hattie. - Can you do that? - Yeah. I'm going to say something to the passengers. Watch the flight deck. Hello. I'm Captain Steele. I need you to remain in your seats... with your seatbelts fastened, but you can nowremove your oxygen masks. What's going on? My kids. Where are my kids? I knowyou all want answers and believe me so do I... and I'll do my best to get them, but right nowl have to do my job... - so that we're all safe. - Safe? Safe from what? Sit down! Safe from our own panic, which is the biggest threat to this plane right now. Now, I'm going to ask the flight attendants to do a head count... whatever happens to those people, we'll find them. I haven't been able to reach anyone yet so I don't knowifthis... event was isolated to our aircraft or if others in the area have been affected. But I promise as soon as I have something to tell you, I will. That's it? Raymie? I understand, I will. Just a minute please. Kimmy. Oh, God. Kimmy. Oh God, Kimmy's gone. Ray, what is happening? Hattie. You've gotta pull yourselftogether. - Just hold me, just hold me. - Hattie, Hattie, Hattie, look at me. Look at me. We're trained for emergencies and we're gonna do ourjobs. But I'm on my own up here. So I really need you to focus, all right? - Okay? - Okay. Now, listen. I want you to go back and do a full check ofthe manifest. Let's at least find out who they are, and howmany ofthem are missing. All right? Ray, I'm scared. Aren't you? I will be. As soon as I have time. Please. Please, help me. No one will help me. My baby, she's gone. She's siX months old. No one will help me. - I'm sorry. - Help me! This is Cameron Williams reporting from PanCon Flight 2-5-7. We're somewhere overthe Atlantic, heading for London... about three hours from JFK. Something... impossiblejust took place on this plane. Ma'am... can you tell me what you saw? I don't know. My kids, they'rejust gone, they just disappeared. What we're you doing when it happened? Nothing! Ljust was sitting here... I thought that maybe I'd fallen asleep and I'd drop her or something... that maybe I was screaming, I don't know. As unbelievable as this may sound people from all overthis... plane have simply vanished... leaving their clothes... and all their personal possessions, everything else. Hey, that's my brother's! No! Miss? Are you okay? It's okay. It's okay. This isn't it. It can't be. This isn't what? No. I knowwhat's going on here. What do you know? Okay. It's a bad trip. You've had them before. It's not gonna last forever. Hello? Can anyone hear me? It's all right. Let's get you in your seat. There we go. Get you buckled in. All right? You said that you knew what happened. None ofthis is happening. It's okay, we're gonna get through this. All right? You're right. None of this happening. Nope. I want you to relaX, okay? Sit back, relaX. Try get some sleep. Can you tell me what you saw? I sawthe same thing you did. Doesn't look any different from down here. Look, come on. Anything strange before the people vanished? Aflash, a sound, anything? Nah. What about there? Who was that? I don't know, some guy. Anything unusual about that guy? Look, pal, there's something unusual about all of us here. Get that thing out of my face. Come on... HI, thls Is the Steele household. Please leave your name and number. Moml Mom, please pick up the phone, I don't knowwhat's going on. Raymie. If you went home and you can hear me right now, I need you to listen, okay? I knowthat you're scared, and I'm scared too... but I really need you to pick up the phone. I need you to let me knowthat you're okay. I need to hear your voice. I love you guys. I think what we should all be doing right now... - is saying a prayer. - A prayer? Aprayerto who? To God. Whose God? - Yours or mine? - Just to God. You wanna knowwhat I think? No. Attention, passengers, since we haven't reached the halfway point... I'm turning back to New York. We'll be atJFKln a llttle over three hours. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Who's in there? Who's in there? - Raymie! - Miss, back up, back up. Not here. Go around. Nobody's been down this street. HI, thls Is Irene Steele. You okay? Did you do the count? I tried, but most ofthem aren't even sitting in their seats. Most ofthem aren't even sitting at all. They're scared, Ray. We're all scared. Well, let's hope that whatever it was doesn't happen again. What's that? Charlie 1581. This is PanCon 2-5-7, do you copy? Charlie 1581, we have an emergency situation. Repeat, we have an... Charlle 1581. Thls Is PanCon 2- 5-7, do you copy? Charlle 1581, you are approachlng our fllght path. We have an emergency sltuatlon. You're approaching our flight path. Get out there and prep the cabin! Now! All passengers, take your seats and put your seat belts on immediately. Charlie 1581, you are in our airspace. I am climbing 1000 feet. That is one, zero, zero, zero, feet. Mayday. This is PanCon 2-5-7. We have been involved in a collision. Charlie 1581 is down. Our coordinates are... four, seven... This is an emergency situation. We have a plane down, we need search and rescue. Repeat, this is an emergency. Come on, there has to be someone out there. What is wrong with you? You really believe... a group ofterrorists could develop a weapon like this? We are not talking about a car bomb. Lfthis was a weapon, it's not from this planet. - What eXactly are you saying? - I'm saying, maybe they were abducted. Aliens? Come on. Can you believe this guy? Hey, watch your head. All right. Slowly. All right, you in the front. All right. Let's get outta here. Is everyone okay? - That other plane, did it lose people? - I don't know. Your camera. I need you to take a picture of the wing forthe Captain. Slr, out of the way. Move back. EXcuse me. EXcuse me. Raymie! Raymie? Medlcal staff needed In south wlng. Dr. Brandon needed In O.R. Nurses statlon three-east plckup extenslon 17. Okay. Here's what I could get. Looks like we came about siX inches from losing the wing. - And the spoiler's gone. - What does that mean? It'sjust going to be a little tougher to slow down when we get home. The main runway at JFK's long enough. Good thing we didn't hit the tail. I guess it's our lucky day. They're all gone. Not just the babies, the older kids, too. Are you sure? I'm looking for my brother. I heard some doctors talking a while ago. It's notjust here; it's everywhere. All overthe world. They said no one's seen a single kid since it happened. We've either damaged some of our computer sensors or... Cameron, I've lost the autopilot, can you go to the very back and check... if you can see if there's any liquid spraying out from the wing? Liquid? You mean fuel. I'm going to take us up a fewthousand feet. Thinner air should give us more range, just in case. Perfect. We have to go back. We have to go back. We are going back, we'll be home in a fewhours, all right? No, I mean back to where they disappeared, I need to find my baby. We're losing fuel. Okay, we were halfway to London... we're not going to have enough to get home. - What if we can't get home? - We have fuel reserves. We're gonna be fine. Are we on fire? We all have a right to know if we're going to die, okay? - No one's gonna die. - Seatbelts on now. Hey, everyone listen up. No one is gonna die. - You hear me? - Sit down, everyone sit. Now our Captain's right. As hard as it may be... we all need to stay calm. Your belts on. No, no, I've lost everythlng I've ever worked for. - We're on fire. - Where? The wing. This side. Is the wing on fire or is the spray on fire? The spray. It's big. We're flying in front ofit. It'll burn off. But? It's fuel. Fuel we need to get home. Can you still get us back? Well, that depends... on ifthe leak is here or here. So what do we do? We let it burn and see what's left. Fire's out. The levels haven't changed. - Does that mean we're empty? - It means we don't know. And I've lost the elevators. - The what? - The elevators. Can't climb. Looks like we've begun our decent into New York about two hours early. - I can't believe we can't reach anyone. - You have a satellite phone? Investigativejournalist. Pilot. Yeah, it seems the only other plane up here was the one that hit us. Did you talk to them? Did they lose any passengers? I don't knowabout passengers, but I do knowthis: There wasn't anyone flying that plane. EXcuse me. I wasjust thinking. What ifthey are still here? What? I mean... what if wejust cannot see them? Like, you know, ifthey're invisible? Ha! Geez Louise. Is invisible any crazier than vanished? Hello. Thls Is ThreeStar Alarms. We've detected an alarmfrom your system. Due to an unusual call volume, we are unable to... - What do you knowabout Kimmy? - What? - Howwell did you knowher? - Not very. - It's maybe my third run with her. - Go grab her stuff. - What stuff? - Anything. Her purse, herjacket, her overnight bag. Just go get her things and bring them in here. - Please. - Okay. Attentlon passengers, we have another alrcraft In our alr space... return to your seats, fasten your seatbelts. Charlle 1581, you're In our alr space. I am cllmblng 1000 feet, that Is one, zero, zero, zero... Dump the purse. Dump the purse. Come on, just, just... What are you looking for? Either I'm going crazy orthe entire world is insane. What are you talking about? I think I knowwhere they are. What if we're not where we think we are, or even when? What do you mean? Well, what if we passed through a wormhole... a wrinkle in the spaceltime fabric? Theoretically, we could be in a different dimension... where those people don't even eXist. - Where they never eXisted. - That's insane. Stop lt. That's enough all of you! I knowwhat's going on here. - You do? - Howmuch did he pay you? What are you talking about? I can't believe he's doing this. She's my daughter! Okay, Miss, I don't knowwhat you think's going on here, but... Get up! Where did you get that? - You! - Yes? - Howmuch did he pay you? - What? Where did he take her? Who, please... Who are you talking about? - My husband. - Miss, please! Shut up! Just shut up! Ma'am, who is your husband? Just tell us that. - Why are you doing this? - Listen to me. I promise you. I've never met your husband. Why are you going along with this? Lady, look, I don't knowwhat "this" is but... Howabout ljust shoot you in the face? Heaven? What has happened to you? Why are you talking like this? You've never spoken about God before. Where's this coming from? From... my wife. Miss, please. Just forget about him okay? He's an idiot. But he's not a part of anything. Point that gun at me. I'm an idiot? What about her? She's... Miss, please. Point the gun at me. There you go. That's good. Okay. Now, just tell me what you think's going on. He's trying to take herfrom me. He thinks he can buy his way out of anything. I took my daughter and I ran. I fell asleep. And somebody put something in my drink I should have known he would find a way... He couldn't have done this. There's no way. This plane landed while I was sleeping. He took her. He paid all of you to lie to me. I can't lose her, I can't. You need to listen to me. I was awake the whole time. This plane never landed. No one got offthis plane. Then where is she? I can't lose her. I can't, she's all I have. He already thinks I'm crazy. What am I supposed to say? That shejust disappeared? I knowwhere she is. Pastor Barnes? Chloe! Oh, no. Thank God you're still here. My Mom and Raymie, when I sawthat they were gone... - I was scared that God had... - He did, Chloe. Just like He promised. In the blink of an eye. - What? - It's true. Then why are you still here? It's in the Bible. My parents sent me to camp one summer... and everyone was talking about this. They said that one day millions of people were going tojust disappear. Millions? - What else did they say? - I don't remember. - It was a long time ago. - Are you saying it was the devil? No. It was God. Don't tell me you believe this. It doesn't matter what I believe. Where are they? Where did they go? To Heaven. - P.K. Was right. - What do you mean? - Maybe I really am crazy. - No. - Maybe she's better offwithout me. - Don't say that. No. No, please, don't! Maybe the whole world's better offwithout me. You need to listen to me now. Don't do this. You can'tjust give up on her. - Do you have children, Mr. Williams? - No. I don't. But I did have a Mom. She was sick. My Dad, he tried everything. The doctors, the pills... but in the end, it didn't matter. I came home from school one day and I found her. She wasjust lying there, still. Don't you do that to Katie. And we may not knowwhat happened here today... but it is not Katie's fault, do you hear me? What if she's out there somewhere right now, watching us? Yeah, that's good. Hattie. This isn't about us. It's about the truth. You need to focus on the truth. The truth, Ray? Are you serious? Yes. This isn't about our past; it's about right now What's happening on this plane right now... what could be happening everywhere right now. So they're all in Heaven. That's your conclusion. Without speaking to anyone outside of this plane... you're going tojump on the first eXplanation that pops into your head? Irene knewthis was coming. In detail. Howcould that be possible? The way it happened. The way they disappeared... even the way that the clothes were still there. Perfect detail. How could she knowthat? Think about it. Why don't you think about this? You lied to me about your wife. You lied to your wife about this trip. - You even lied to your own daughter. - I know. It seems that you're able to lie to just about everybody in your life... and nowyou're asking me to find God. Hattie! I don't understand. You were here every day. You worked here. You preached here. That's not what counted. - What do you mean? - I knewthe words. I could quote them chapter and verse... but that's not enough. You have to believe. Believe? Believe in what? In a God that killed my father? A God that grabbed my mother, my brother, and ripped them out ofthis world? A God that crashes planes and destroys cities? - He took them to protect them. - From what? From the darkest time in the history of this world. Persecution, war, and seven years of darkness. He took them to Heaven. And what about the rest of us? What about me? What am I supposed to do? It's not about what we do. It's about asking forforgiveness. - It's about turning our lives over... - Stop it! The God my mother talked about would never do something like this. Chloe, please, listen to me. Listen to you? Why should I? You didn't even listen to you. The Air Marshal. Yeah. I forgot all about him. PanCon 2- 5-7, thls Is Dlspatch. This is PanCon 2-5-7. Calling Dispatch. PanCon 2- 5-7. Thls Is Marcus. Ray, are you there? Marcus! Ray, where are you? I'm twenty minutes outside ofJFK. I had to turn around. How many dld you lose? So it is everywhere. The whole planet, buddy. No one knows how many, but mllllons. - No. This can't be happening. - What about my family? I need you to call Irene, make sure they're safe. How's your fuel? Critical. I'll be lucky to reach the coast without ditching. Llsten, there are planes down everywhere. The roads are jammed, the runways are full wlth blrds, and nowhere to go. There's no way you're gettlng In atJFK. What about LaGuardia? I'm sorry, Ray. So where am I going? You're golng to have to go Inland. Marcus, I can't go inland! What do you want me to tell you, Ray? Syracuse Is the closest open runway. Syracuse is impossible. You're going to have to talk to them. They're going to have to clear us something. Marcus. Marcus. JFK Tower, this is PanCon 2-5-7. I have a lowfuel emergency. I need a runway. Repeat, I need a runway. So, is there a backup plan? I'm gonna level with you. We're notjust lowon fuel; we're on fumes. JFK was the closest airport and we would have been lucky to have made it that far. We only have one option: Hope that they clear us a runway and that they do it soon. - What about the water? - Can't raise the nose. If we hit the water, this thing's going to disintegrate. I can't let those people back there go down... without ever getting a chance to undo some oftheir mistakes. You're venice Baxter, aren't you? Tom's daughter. You probably don't remember. We met once, at your father's office. You were sitting right by him at this little yellow desk. I rememberthinking: "This guy has got his place... decorated with the best of everything... but he's got this little plastic desk sitting right there beside him... like it's the finest piece of furniture in the room". Sometimes that was the only way I got to see him. Well... at least he was trying. I have a little girl, too. I mean she was little. She's married nowand she never had a desk in my office. Truth is, I was so busy... I hardly ever sawher at all. You know... when all these people disappeared I never even thought about her. I wish nowl could say I did, but... I was thinking about money, about opportunity... about making my next meeting. I'm sorry. You knowwhat you said about Heaven? As much as I want to see her... when I get home, I hope she's not there. I need you to try and find Chloe for me. I've been trying. The truth is I haven't stopped thinking about her since I got on the plane. I can understand that. JFK Tower. Do you hear me? We're headed forthe coast. Our fuel is at critical. I need a clear runway. Repeat, I need a clear runway. Listen to me, I have a plane full of people here. I have no spoilers, no flaps, no elevators... and ifl run this thing dry, no reverse thrust. I need some room. Were you with her, when she got the concert tickets? I was. What can I say? She was hurt. I should never have left her today. You didn't know. I knew she came home to see me and I left. I left her alone. God only knows what she's been going through down there. She loves you, Ray. She will understand. I can't let that be the last thing we say to each other. Ljust can't. I need to tell her the truth. And I need herto knowthat this wasn't her mother's fault, it was all mine. Every time Irene mentioned God... I walked away. Mom? I don't know if you can hear me... but ljust wanted to say... this morning, I felt like our family was falling apart. And I blamed you, and I knowthat I hurt you. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hello? Who is this? Chloe! - This is Buck. - Thank you. Thank God you're alive. Where's my Dad? He's right here. Chloe, are you okay? Daddy. I thought you were dead. Are you okay? Yeah, I guess so. But Mom and Raymie. They're both gone. Mom told me about this. I know. She told me, too. I love you so much, sweetheart. I love you more than anything in the world. Me, too, Daddy. Me, too. I'm so sorry that I lied to you. And that I wasn't there with you today, but... ljust really need you to knowhowmuch I love you, no matter what happens. Wait, Dad, why are you talking like this? What's going on? Where are you? Well, we're still in the air. We're on our way home, but there's a problem. All the alrports are closed and the roads are jammed. There's nowhere to land. - What? - And I don't have enough fuel. Chloe? Dad? Chloe? Ladies and gentlemen. We are coming in on New York. However, we stlll have a challenge ahead. All ofthe airports are closed. I need you to remaln In your seats wlth your seatbelts fastened... and try to remaln calm. But I have to be honest, this is a very serious situation. We're talklng to the ground. We're trylng to flnd... an alternate landlng slte. But we are very low on fuel. Please pay close attention to ourflight crew. And if you believe in prayer... nowwould be the time. - Will you pray with me? - Yeah, of course. Of course, come here. - Nothing. Still can't get a signal. - Keep trying. I will. I'm going to have to put it down... Put it down? - Where? - The water. - But you said... - I know. I'll wait on JFK as long as I can... but I can't fly in there without a clear runway. There's nothing but city on every side ofthe airport. Ifl fly in there and there's nowhere to land... I'll be flying a 400-ton missile right into Queens. JFK tower, this is Pan Con 2-5-7. We need emergency clearance immediately. Get her back. Keep trying. Okay, folks. I need yourfull attention... as we go through the emergency procedures. Underneath your seat you will flnd your llfe jacket. You must keep your seat belt tlghtly fastened... across your walst untll the plane comes to a complete stop. Then you must follow all flight crewinstructions. JFK Tower, this is PanCon 2-5-7. We need emergency clearance right now. JFK Tower, JFK tower. This is Pan Con 2-5-7. We need clearance now. Come on! Okay. Buck? Can you hear me? - Chloe! - Put me on speaker! I thlnk I found a place where you guys can land. The new East-West highway nearthe mall. No one's out here. I think I can clear enough room. Our guidance system is out. I won't be able to find it in the dark. Hey Chloe, your phone. I want you to open up the compass app. Hang on. Okay, I got it. Okay, you see the bottom those little numbers? I need you to read those to me. Okay. Ah, 40.66.34 North. 73.78.32 West. Got it! Chloe, howmuch room have we got? I'm at half a mile, but there's more. Howmuch more? I need at least a mile. Okay, hang on. Chloe! Chloe, are you still there? I'm at seven tenths, eight tenths... Buck? Buck, can you hear me? Hello? Shit. Come on. You've gotta be kidding me. Come on! We need a visual of some kind so we can see where the landing zone begins. Howare you? You mind if I sit down for a moment? Just until your husband gets back from the bathroom. - We're out of fuel. - What? No. I can still land it. We can glide down, but we're going to hit the ground fast. I'll have no thrust to slowus down, just the brakes. We're going to need every inch she can get us. - Dad? - Chloe! Chloe! I'm out of road. I'm at nine tenths of a mile... but there's a bunch of heavy equipment blocking my way. Honey, nine tenths is good enough. But I need a bright visual point... of reference so I can see where the landing zone is. Okay. I'm flashing my breaks; can you see that? No, we're too far out forthat. I need something bigger and brighter, like a flare. But we're running out oftime. I have to come in right now. Chloe?! Okay. God, how do you smoke without matches? There's not enough room, is there? Lfthere isn't, I don't want her to think it was her fault. This is it. We're coming down. - Can you see anything? - No. Keep looking. We're within about three miles. We get one try. I need to knowwhere it starts. - Nothing yet. - Come on, honey. There! Come on. We might have lost the landing gear. You have no left wheel. Oh, we're home. Is everyone okay? I need you, everyone offthe plane now. Everyone get up, make your way up. One at a time, let's go. Buck, when you go to the bottom, would you help them get off? Let's go, let's go. When you get to the bottom, please get away from the plane as soon as you can. You gotta go. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on, let's go. Go. Go. Careful. Go. Go, go. If you're eXiting the rear, go back down. Everybody. Go, go, go. Hey! Hey! - Buck! - Chloe! Thank you. You did a great job. You, too. Hattie! I'm sorry. I know. Dad! I should have been here with you. With Mom and with Raymie. I should never have left. I'mjust glad that you're okay. I thought you might want these. - Oh, thank heavens. - We're okay. It looks like the end ofthe world. No, not yet. I'm afraid this is just the beginning.
