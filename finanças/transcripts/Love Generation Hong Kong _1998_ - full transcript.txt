It's still warm. Of course. I just bought it. If I had bought it from my place, it'd be all cold by now. What's the plan tonight? It's Tuesday today so we'll have dinner together. I'm working part-time tomorrow. OK. Is that lecherous boss of yours still harassing you? Why are you always looking at that apple? It's beautiful. Do you wish to buy it? Yes. But it's very pricey. I know. It's all right. I'm happy just looking at it. If you've the money, you should buy HSBC shares. It will go up. Trust me. Bill, which shares should I buy today? Trust me, HSBC is the one to hold in the long term. But it's already over ninety dollars per share. The Hong Kong stock market still has room to rise, so don't worry. Don't worry? It's 5,000 points now! It will hit 15,000 points before 1997 and property prices will rise to $20,000 psf. I may not be around anymore after 1997. Why not? If you're still around by then, sell all your properties and stocks. Hong Kong is like Japan; it's a bubble economy. Everyone thinks prices will keep rising but the bubble will eventually burst. Should we believe him? Hey, is there any discount on this? Hey? Hey! I'm talking to you. Hey... It's already discounted. There's no further discount. How can that be? Everyone is giving discounts everywhere! Hey, come on, give me a discount. Miss, I have a name and it's not "Hey." What's the big deal? Let me try it first. You can't do that! If you want to try it, I'll give you the sample. What's the big deal? You can have it back. What kind of woman is that? Shameless. Michelle, your call. Hello? Dad. Yes. What's up? What? $15,000? What is it for? I'd told you not to gamble! I don't have that much money! Do you think I'm an ATM? Are you OK? Yes. Bill, let's have lunch together. I thought we were going to have dinner tonight. I'd taken my lunch. I've something to tell you. Let me tell you something. I'm reading an awesome economics book. It says economies are cyclical. I reckon that... Asian economies will shoot up before 1997 but will fall right after that... and will only pick up again in the year 2000. There will be high unemployment rate then. The only cycle I know is my monthly cycle. What? —Bye. —OK. Bye. I'd used this before; it's great. No way! This is not good at all. Stop arguing. I'll recommend you something even better. I'm sorry. —It's OK. I'll take care of it. —Sorry. Hey! What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? I'm helping you. I don't need your help! Your hand is dirty. Let me... Do you know I can sue you for sexual harassment? Everybody knows that I'm gay... Stop the pretence! —Huh? —Michelle, there's a fax for you. Thanks. How's your day? We'll meet in 423 minutes. I can't wait. See you at our usual place. Are you dealing with your personal matter during office hours? It's a local fax. Local? Is electricity free? Is paper free? Isn't this the Mickey Mouse handkerchief I'd lost long ago? You stole it! You stole it from me. What a crook! I'll file a complaint! You're done for! New Shop Opening What the heck is this? We've made a reservation yet they kept us waiting for so long. I don't know what's so great about the food. What's the big deal with rice balls and slices of raw fish? Sushi is cheap and yummy. With a concept like this... their business will grow and more shops will be opened. Trust me. I trust you. Are you upset? What should I be happy about? Did I make you mad? You didn't. I'm just feeling grumpy. If you don't want to queue, let's have burgers then. We've been dating for years. It's either sushi or burgers every single time. I'm sick and tired. I'm not asking for abalone... but I don't want burgers and sushi for the rest of my life. How about Kentucky Fried Chicken then? You don't understand her at all. It's not the food she cares about. It's about her life; she wants a change. Oh, I got it! No Kentucky, let's go for karaoke! You still don't get it. Tell it to him explicitly. I don't know how to tell you. You meant to tell him that he'll always be a white-collar worker. A small fry. You meet twice a week. After dating for two years and if you get pregnant unexpectedly... you'll have no choice but to marry him, have kids... and start paying mortgages. That's your life. Am I right? Yes, yes! Isn't everybody like this? Precisely because everybody is like this, I... I don't want to be the same. I don't know her. But I can read her mind. She's right. After graduation, she worked for two years... got married, had kids and watches TV and plays mahjong every day. Life will be as such for the rest of her life. If I were her, I wouldn't be happy with such a life either! I'm smart and handsome. If I work hard enough, I'll surely make it big, right? Of course! Rest assured, one day I'll make it big... and you'll be the happiest wife on earth. Everyone here dreams of making it big. —Will everyone succeed? —I'm confident. I know you can succeed. That's why I don't want to be your stumbling block. I saw that you even skipped lunch to read books on finance and economics. I think, without me, you can succeed sooner. What are you talking about? It sounds like a break-up. Michelle, I know you won't. I will. I think a break-up will be good for the both of us. —Is it because I'm poor? —No, that's not the reason. I feel your chance to strike it rich is greater if we're not together. Give the both of us a chance. If we stay together, we'll end up forever a white-collar worker and salesgirl. We'll be a miserable couple. I don't want that! I've been eyeing this apple for the longest time. Now I give it to you. Is this the end for us? It doesn't have to be. We'll both work hard... and make it big. If we're meant to be... we'll certainly meet again. I'll make it big for sure. Can you lower your voice? Our neighbours can hear you! I'm already very gentle... Does it hurt? I can't get in! Who is it? It's Bill! I feel hopeless! I'm even more hopeless! I'm miserable! Not as miserable as me! I got dumped! Is that not miserable enough? Open the door! Open the door! Hey! What have you done? What have you done? Bill, I'm miserable... Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. I've done something that's going to ruin my life. If people get to know about it, I can't be a dentist anymore. —Calm down. —I can't be a dentist! Calm down! What happened exactly? I've done something horrible to my younger sister. Now the floor is covered with blood. She's just fifteen! And she's also very pretty... I gave her a pair of sneakers as a present before that. You're a beast! How could you? You pervert! You're a beast! Are you all right, Sis? Let's go to the cops. Pal, do you need to go to the cops for braces? Braces? Wow. I just wanted to practise but I failed. If the medical school gets to know about it, they'll fail me for sure. Why didn't you say so earlier? What were you yelling about just now? Oh yes, I got dumped! Michelle broke up with me. I swear... I must make it big. I'm not satisfied with just being a white-collar worker. Bill, you can do it. Don't worry. I can foresee that you'll be a magnate... with a pretty secretary taking notes for you... and a chauffeur driving you in your Rolls-Royce. Your pretty secretary will give you a massage when you need it. Just write her a note if you need anything. No problem. You can make it. So, I've made up my mind. I'll go to America to give it a shot. That's good... Moon will be going there to study next year. There're only three people in my life. So you two must return safe and sound. I should be a dentist by then and can help to clean your teeth. You can make it! Moon, I've gone to the hot spring. I'd written down what you need to do. Send these clothes to the laundry. Fax these documents to New York. The foreigner next door complained that Joey was making too much noise. Tell the hotel to get him another room. The New York office will call tonight. Tell them everything is OK... and prepare a bank guarantee of two hundred million. Hello? Yes. Mr Kay is not around. But don't worry. He said everything is going smoothly. You look fat in this picture! When did they take this? I don't like taking photos. I've always kept a low profile. Yes, Mr Whiz of Wall Street. You're in charge of a twenty-billion fund. They said you're responsible for the Asian financial crisis. Nonsense. I'd anticipated that six years ago. Six years ago? You were very poor then. I'm still as poor six years later. No, you have me, a superstar. Yes... hundreds of your fans welcomed you at the airport. This is what's called a "perfect match." Reminder: Meeting at two in the afternoon. Why are you hiding, Moon? The New York office has asked that I remind you... you must close the deal no matter what. If not, they'll suffer a great loss. All right, you're such a nag. Don't bully her. Without her, you're nobody. I know. She's the only one who knows where my socks are. You're right. Let's go. The Japanese guy you're meeting must be a fan of mine. So, take me with you and he'll agree to everything you say. Don't! Look at those steely eyes. It's intimidating. He's going to slash my prices by thirty per cent at least. We hope to reduce the price by thirty per cent. I don't think that's possible. What a cunning and sly man! He's trying to bore me into lowering my offer? Fat chance! I must score beautifully like Ronaldo does. Just one kick and you're done for! Darn Japanese. Mr Kay, are you feeling cold? No, I am fine. Are you serious in the deal, dude? —Please wait. —He's up to some trick. We need some time to think about it. I'm going to Hong Kong next Wednesday. Let's meet up again then. I can't take it anymore. Nice to meet you. Do I have to be so fake? Bill, I'm done shopping. Yes. Are you done with the meeting? —Joey! —Please sign an autograph for me! I think we've discussed enough. Joey? Is that you, Joey? —Thank you, Joey. —I'm so happy to see you. I love your movies. Can you please autograph for me? What a coincidence. Right here, please. Thank you. Bill, are you done with the meeting? That's the moron I had the meeting with. So, how was it? I almost gave him a punch. Come. He's my boyfriend. Really? I'm so envious of your beautiful girlfriend. —What's he talking about? —Well, keep in touch. I'll buy you dinner when I'm in Hong Kong next Wednesday. Bring your girlfriend too. See you later. He's nuts! He wants to dine with you and Joey in Hong Kong. It's a done deal then. I won't dine with that lecher. No, he's quite handsome and polite. —He's lecherous! —Why are you so fierce? This is an important project. I don't believe I can't make it without him. —Hey! —Bill... Take them. I'll get him back. Hey! Why are you so mad? I don't feel like saying. You're jealous. You... You don't adore me like before. You don't love me as wholeheartedly as before! —So you mean I flirted with him? —You... Come on... We're in the car. What do you mean? I mean, we're in the car now. So? You weren't like this before. I know... You don't love me anymore. Unreasonable. Women don't have to be reasonable. Ouch! Stop the car! You bit me again! Let me tell you - no poking of the eyes, no fighting! I don't care. Let's break up! Break up? Don't just say it. I'll take it seriously. All right then. The ring... and the watch are gifts from you. You can have them back. This watch is from you. Take it back! —Are you a man? —Of course! I'm a man from head to toe! The suit and tie are from me. Fine. I'll take them all off. The shirt... I don't want it too! —And the trousers are from me as well. —Fine! I owe you this one first. I'll return it to you the next time. Darn! I went overboard this time. Say something nice to me... so as to give me a way out. Darn! This is so awkward. Come and coax me. Sweet-talk me and I'll forgive you. I'm a man. I shouldn't be the one to apologise. I was with Michelle together for so long... and I never had to coax her. Why should I do it now? Jerk! You keep me waiting for so long. What are you up to? I bet she's crying now. It's not a big deal to coax a lady, is it? It's definitely better than walking around in my underwear. Gosh, I can't believe she did this to me. Darn, I can't remember where the hotel is. What should I do? Bill? Let's cross the road first. It's been a long while. Why are you in Japan? I'm here for a business deal. In such an outfit? That's why the deal didn't go through. It doesn't matter. Six years ago, I said you had it in you to succeed. I know talent when I see it. Actually, I... —Why don't we go grab a bite? —OK. You haven't eaten the whole day? Yes. I came to Japan to shop. I really didn't expect that... we could meet again six years later and what's more, in Japan. I told you if we're meant to be... we'll meet again one day. How have you been all these years? So far so good. This bowl of noodles... is the one I've enjoyed most in all these years. Why don't you buy me this? I'll treat you back in Hong Kong. Sure! Was that very mean of me? A little. Even you think so! Bill doesn't have cash or his cards with him. How is he going to get back to the hotel? But I was really mad... so I told the driver to drive off. But I... I didn't know what to do. Let's search separately. You go that way and I'll go this way. Please apologise on my behalf when you find him. Why are you keeping so silent? I don't know what to say. I wanted very much to tell you... what I'd gone through in the past six years. But I don't know where to begin... and who I am to you now to tell you all these. Six years ago, you were my girlfriend. Now, you still are. But I can't. You've got a boyfriend? I'm getting married in two weeks' time. Sometimes, love isn't necessarily equal to marriage. Why marry him if you don't love him? What I feel for him is different from what I felt towards you. When we were dating... our love was very passionate. But my feeling towards him... It's rather unexciting. But it is slow and steady. Is he wealthy? Kind of. I'm not sure if you've ever heard of the name... Wo Peng. He's a triad leader... in Hong Kong? He's no longer involved in that. I do love him. If you're back in Hong Kong, you must attend my wedding. I'll ask him to get you a job. Get me a job? Here's some money. Take it. Oh, she thinks I'm still that poor guy from six years ago. You've to pay me back! Yes, I know. I'll pay you back. Thanks. Take care. —You too. —Bye. You're back? You worried us sick. Where's Joey? We went searching for you separately. I bumped into a friend just now. Guess who? Who? Michelle. Michelle? How's she? Good. She hasn't changed much. We chatted for a few hours. The feeling came gushing back. Are you thinking of getting back with her again? The opportunity has come. What about Joey? Don't tell her first. How? Bill! Sorry. I promise not to throw tantrums in the future. Please don't be mad at me. It's not your fault. What's the matter now? Something happened to her brother. What now? Her brother is dying. What happened? He contracted AIDs from one of his patients. What? Yes! See how upset she is. What do we do now? We're going back to Hong Kong to see him one last time. Shall I go with you? Whatever. But I'm afraid his saliva may get onto you when he's talking... and that's probably not too good for you. Then, perhaps I'll stay in Tokyo for two more days to go shopping? —Sure. —OK. At the same time, I'll wheedle that Japanese guy. OK. I'll go book the flight tickets. Moon. Do this as well. I'll make it up to you tonight. Moon, you're always so important to me. Your teeth are loose... so if you get punched, all of them may fall off. How come? And the enamel is thin. I bet you aren't using toothpaste with fluoride. What do you want to do then? You've many cavities too. —How much does it cost? —A hundred and fifty. —A hundred and fifty each? —For everything. Everything? That will be three grand at least! What? What did you say? —Tell me once more. —A hundred and fifty... You said that. I didn't con you. Come on! A hundred and fifty to fix all my cavities, OK? Come. Do you need anaesthetic? It may be a little painful. Of course! I'll thrash your clinic and make you pay me if you hurt me. OK... I guarantee it will be painless. Take this "painless pill." —Don't lie to me. —Trust me. No pain. It'd better be. If not, you know the consequences, right? —Yes... —I'll steal the battery. The wheels... and the steering wheel. Are you scared? —And I'll beat you up. —No pain... —I'm serious... —No pain... see? It's not painful. Thug, you want a free treatment? Fai D and Mun D! Fai D and Mun D! Where are you? I'm calling for you. Why are you standing here? —Brother. —Sis? —And me! —Bill! Sis! You've grown so much taller. Bill! Sis! Are you hungry for something? I need friendship. Back off. Boss, this pretty girl... Is she your younger sister? Aren't we alike? Sis, let me introduce them. Fai D. Mun D. They're the most shameless and randy people in the clinic. They ogle women of all ages. They're my part-time assistants. They're cheap. Why are you back suddenly? It's because of Michelle. You two had broken up for a long time. I bumped into her in Japan. I still have feelings for her. I want to try and win her back. If I don't, I'm afraid I may regret it for life. I read from the tabloids you've a celebrity girlfriend. It's tough. The paparazzi are mean. I'll end up in a mess if I'm not careful. Go after her if you want. But the problem is, she's getting married to... Brother Wo Peng in two weeks. —Who? —Brother Wo Peng. This is one of his sidekicks. —He? —Yes. Treat him like an ash tray. He always comes browbeating me... and demands for free treatments. What are you doing? Taking notes. That's your occupational hazard. We're just chit-chatting. Moon... Have some oranges and let's have fun together later? You won't stand a chance! Cut the crap. I've an idea. Get him to take me to meet Brother Wo Peng. You want to meet Brother Wo Peng? Are you kidding? I'd fixed them all for you. You look good now. Why does my breath smell of cigarettes? —I didn't smoke today. —Let me smell it. I didn't smell cigarettes; I smell oranges. —Are you sure? —Kit! I'm Sunny's friend. I just came back from Japan. Michelle said Brother Wo Peng has a job for me. —Don't try to be funny. —I'm not. It was Michelle who told me that. —What's your name? —Bill. Bill, right? If he does have a job for you, your first salary will be mine. No problem. Let's go. A hundred and fifty dollars! —I'll pay you later! —Where's your boss? He's playing football. Good ball! Boss, that's a good one! This is World Cup standard! I'll go to Italy to play football as a career. Yes, you should. Take all your sidekicks there too. Huh? What are you staring at? He's really here. —Who? —Bill! Bill! I've heard your name before but I haven't met you in person. Allow me. Brother Wo Peng. Bill. —Wo Peng. —Hi, I'm Bill. Michelle talks about you often, saying you treated her very well in the past. She talks about you often too, saying you treat her very well now. —Of course. —Wo Peng, Bill is looking for a job. Can you look out for him? We're getting married next week. Japan isn't that small... yet you bumped into each other. That's such a coincidence. Never say never, right? I'd thought of marrying her few years back. —Do you play football? —I play the goalkeeper. —Sure. Let's do it. —OK. Stop fighting! I didn't tell him to blow the whistle! Kick him out! Stop! Wo Peng, do you remember what you promised me? Of course I do. We're just having fun. Bill, you're good! Whenever I play with these guys... I'll score seventeen times at least. But you saved every one of them. Let's go get a drink. Why did you blow the whistle? Why don't you let go of him? Let him go. —Michelle said you're jobless. —Yes. I've got many guys who can fight... but not many who have brains. You should be able to assist me. I won't do anything illegal. I'm semi-retired. I'm no longer in the illegal businesses. Actually, I respect you somewhat. I treat Michelle the best I can... but I know, in her heart, you mean more to her than I do. The most precious thing in the world is always the one you can't have. What's your secret? Tell me. I won't be mad. I've something that you don't have. Something I don't have? You must be kidding me! I have everything and what I have most is cash! —You have something that I don't? —Yes. Yes, Boss... From his facial features, I can tell he's probably endowed in other ways. Go to hell! Dimwit. Tell me. The things Michelle and I had been through as a couple... our lives together and our memories are things you can never have. Thanks for your coke. Bill. What are you thinking? You're still the most important person to me all these years. You're going to get married in two weeks' time. I'll make a last-ditch effort to win you back. I hope you'll give me a chance. I'm staying with Sunny now. Call me if you've time. He's nuts. He's trying to snatch you from me. Boss, let me kill him for you! Are you scared? Scared? Not at all! Well, maybe a little. Hello. Michelle, I'd like to see you. Bill, do you know you're in danger? Brother Wo Peng is a nice guy. —Bill... —I know. But I really want to see you. See you at our usual place, OK? —All right. —Bye. We used to have to queue for a long time in the past. The business is on track now. In the past six years, we've opened twelve branches. International Group Buys Over Hong Kong's Largest Sushi Chain The new boss shows up unexpectedly. It's a good thing I'm smart. I didn't expect that my ex-girlfriend... is going to marry the most influential triad leader in Hong Kong. How did he woo you? My dad borrowed money from them. You know how impulsive I am. I went to negotiate with them. Well, it turned out that he didn't ask me to repay the debt... and even lent me money to start a business. And then he wooed you? He's still a human being after all. Was it because he gave you money? No. I fell for him after getting to know him. He may look strong and intimidating... but he's quite a child at heart. He needs someone to look after him. I need to be taken care of too. Bill, you will. You'll meet a great girl. It's you? Sorry, but you're... We were in the same queue outside this shop six years ago! We argued and you stopped us. You two broke up but we got married. I remember now. Congratulations... Are you back together? We're friends. Son, greet uncle and aunty. I want to pee. What a pain! You take him to the loo. Let's go together, lazybones! If we hadn't broken up six years ago... we'd be like them I think. If... I'm not jobless but a successful businessman... who's richer than Brother Wo Peng, will you marry me? Why do you ask? I'm just asking for the fun of it. Actually... Welcome...! Welcome our CEO to our shop! Welcome, Mr Kay! —What's happening? —We're welcoming Mr Kay. Did you ask them to do this? Mr Kay is the CEO of Wall Street. He took over our chain last week. Although I'm a small fry, I read high-class magazines like this. Mr Kay, we'll work hard for the company. Sorry. I didn't mean to lie to you. Bill Kay... You're Bill Kay? So, you've really made it big. Sorry. It's a misunderstanding. In the past six years... You've... You've changed. I haven't. My heart has never changed. I can answer your question just now. Although you're successful and richer than Brother Wo Peng... you've changed. I won't get back with you again. Congrats... Congratulations. Order... someone wants to order... Michelle. You're upset again. —I'm not. —No? Whenever you're upset, you'll cook but never eat the food. I've seen this many times. No, I'm eating. Let's tuck in. Steak, sautéed beef, sliced beef, stewed beef, beef brisket... Do you have something against cows? Yes... I'm unhappy. There are many things... There are many things... I'm confused. I know. How did you know? While wooing a girl, Kit saw everything at the sushi bar... and told me everything. Don't do anything rash. I won't. After knowing you, all the rules and regulations that we've agreed upon... I abide by them all. I feel more like I'm a priest now than a triad leader. Yes. Bill is trying to win me back. I know. Little did I expect him to succeed in the past six years. Are you comparing us by our wealth? Of course not! I broke up with him... because I didn't want to be his burden. Now that he's successful and wants to win me back... He wants to win me back. I... It makes me feel gratified. Do you get it? Michelle, you know it very well. I'm well known among the triads not because I'm a bully... but because I'm a fair person. I play fair. The day we're not married, you still have every right to choose. Love is all about accumulating points. Whoever gets more points deducted, I'm not going to choose him. But I want to meet Bill and talk to him. Remember our agreement? Of course I do. No getting drunk, no swearing, no fighting. I'll deduct five points for violation of any of them, up till fifteen points. I'll have to rely on all of you this time. Don't say that, Bill. You're my best friend. It's about your happiness; we'll do our best at all costs. Thanks. I heard it... I heard it all. What did you hear? It doesn't matter. I've a message for you. My boss has an agreement with Michelle. No getting drunk, no swearing and no fighting. If you make him violate any of those, she'll definitely be mad at him. Oh, so you're a traitor! What did you say? I'm a loyal guy. I won't sell my boss out for anything less than a couple of million. Are you done? Let's get ready. Bill, who are you to snatch Michelle from me? I don't fear you at all. What the... Fine. Have you forgotten? My name is Wo Peng (peace). I'm determined to win and I must. You son of a... You can say what you want. I won't get mad. If Michelle marries you, the triad leader, she'll either end up dead or in prison for the rest of her life. You mother... Who do you think you are? Are you cursing me? If you love her, just give up and go away. I'm a man. I fear nothing! Here... have some wine! Everything will go smoothly with a glass of wine in hand. —We didn't order any wine. —This is compliments from us. You won't get drunk from this. White wine? You should have brought him something more potent! This is not white wine. it's the most potent white liquor from China. It contains seventy percent alcohol. It's just like drinking alcohol neat! A sip of white wine should be fine? Bill is not drinking. Why are you drinking? I'll drink. —He drank it. —Even so, you still can't drink. He can't drink at all. Bill, I love you both. I don't want the two of you to fight over me. Bill, you're successful and rich now. Why don't you go back to America? Exactly. So that you... You can reunite with your family. Michelle, we've been apart for six years. You broke up with me because... you didn't want to be my burden. Now that I've achieved success... nothing can separate us anymore. —Plan A has failed. Do we have a Plan B? —Yes! Why do they have a larger room than me? Why didn't you arrange this room for me? Do you know who I am? Do you know I'm chatting with my friends here? Chatting? So what? You nerd! You son of a... You with the loud voice, listen good now. If you don't get out at once, I'll... What? —I'll drink without you. —Scram if you're scared! He's fearless, eh? Doesn't he know Brother Wo Peng? He just came from China and doesn't know anybody. How much did you pay him? A meal at McDonald's plus five dollars. Cheap. Sissy, hit me if you dare. If not, get the hell out of here. I'll endure! Endure? I must endure. I won't. Get out of here! —I can endure. —Oh really? Come on, beat me, sissy! Why not? So darn noisy! She's a superwoman! Beat him up. Don't worry about me. So brutal! You're good. You finished him in a punch! I got into many fights when I was young. You learn martial arts too? Yes, for a while. Hey... Why are you two so friendly now? You don't understand men. We'll go for a ride and come back. Woman, stay here. What's up? Get out of the car. What's up? You want to fight? I beg you! On my knees, I beg you! You're richer and more handsome than me... and already have such sweet memories with Michelle. Give up on her, Brother Bill! It's my turn to beg you! Can you give her up and let me have her back? Of course not. Michelle is a nice girl with a pretty face and good figure. I firmly believe that I can make her happy. Can you? I believe I can do it too! —Let's compete fairly then. —OK. Rest assured, I won't play dirty. I trust you. —All right. —All right. Your car is awesome. It's a twin turbo. Do you want to try driving it? Sure. —Hey, why is it so slow? —How come? Do I need to press this? We're here. At the entrance! —How's Boss? —What's with the flowers? He's an idol in the triad world. How can an idol stay here without flowers? —What are you doing here? —We're trainee doctors. —How's my boss? —He's in a coma but he's not responding. And that scumbag? He's in a coma with no heartbeat or pulse, but is eating noodles now. —Really? —Yes. Scumbag! If anything should happen to my boss, I'll... You'll come and work for me, OK? Be the security manager at my new office. Your salary will be HKD$88,000 per month. Tell the guys outside to keep quiet. In the past six years, you've been taking care... of both his business and private matters. It must be tough on you. To be honest, I'm grateful to him for taking care of me. Not only did he pay for my tuition fees in the States... he also hired me as his personal assistant. I'm very grateful. Does he have a girlfriend? Yes. But they don't really get along. I think Bill loves you more. You're too young to understand what love is. Don't always treat me like a kid. Oh yes. You're a grown-up now. Do you have a boyfriend? No. I'm a lesbian. Really? But you're so pretty! What made you a lesbian? Such a waste! It's horrible inside. All of them have big fierce tattoos. Will they harm Bill? Brother Wo Peng isn't that kind of person. I know he isn't but he's in a coma now. His sidekicks are scary. —Let's go back in then. —Moon. I'd better not go back in. It will be awkward for me when they come round. I don't know... who to show my concern to. Michelle, you can't just sit on the fence; you've to make a decision. Bill stands a chance; she's wavering. Aren't you happy for him? I am. I'm happy for him. Nurse, is it really inside? Yes. But we can't guess what it is. It's... Oh, now I know. Stay away from room 102. There are a bunch of triad members. What happened? I heard someone by the name of Brother Wo Peng is there. Brother Wo Peng! He hasn't come round? It's my fault. It's not, Boss. He's down on his luck. You sail with the wind really fast, eh? Who wants to be in the illegitimate business if he has a choice? The guys outside are getting upset. I'm afraid they'll kill Bill. Don't worry... I'll handle them. Are you going to stop them? No. I'm going to pray to Buddha to bless Boss. —Hey! —Let him be. —I have an idea! —What is it? Swap them around. Nobody would dare hurt Brother Wo Peng. If they come to kill Bill, but stab Brother Wo Peng accidentally... that's fate then! Excuse me! May I know which ward Bill is in? Don't be a gangster if you're a mute! What are you looking at? Where's Bill? It's all my fault. If I didn't go shopping and stayed with you... you wouldn't have gotten into a car crash. You know celebrities like us... always have the paparazzi hot on our heels. I don't want to get you involved. Please don't die. —You've come round! —Who are you? You've lost your memory? I don't know you. You went for plastic surgery? Where's Bill? I'm here. —Are you all right? —Yes. Who suggested the swap? We've subdued him! Call the doctor! My place is the safest. At least you won't get stabbed. It was my forehead and then my thigh. Where next? Stop talking nonsense! You'll be fine. Did Michelle go visit me at the hospital? She went and left. Is she mad at me? She isn't; she cares a lot about you. She just didn't want to feel awkward. I'm beginning to lose my confidence. Don't! I know she still loves you. I need to pee. Help me. Are you serious? It's not like you're crippled. Fine... But I won't help you... take it out. Just help me. Help you get it out? Help me to the washroom! —Moon. —Michelle? Was Bill hurt by a loony at the hospital last night? Yes. But he's fine now. I was worried sick! If he knows you care so much about him, he'll be thrilled. Why don't you go hide somewhere? You come out when I call your name. —Give him a surprise. —Why? Don't ask. Just hide first. Come on, hide somewhere. Don't come out until I call you. Are you done? Where's my brother? He didn't want to pee when I went. When I'm done, he wants to pee. —Guess who's here? —Bill! I brought you supper! This place is rather old... but we can see planes taking off and landing. It's quite romantic. Yes. The view is particularly awesome tonight. The airport won't be here after tomorrow. It has been relocated. Let's go for a ride. No. I don't feel like it. Let's go take a look at the new airport. What's so good with the new one? The old one is more beautiful. Of course, the new one is better! The old one is closing down. I grew up with this airport. A lot of things happened during that time. They're particularly meaningful to me. Why do you like all things old? Just like this old, rotten apple! You always take it with you! I don't understand why. —Give it back to me! —Why? No! —No! I won't give it to you! No... —Shut up, witch! You're dead meat! You broke the thing he treasures most! —You scared me, that's why I dropped it. —I saw you throwing it. Shut up! —Please go. —You're kicking me out? No matter what, I'm a superstar! Lots of men are after me. But what am I to you? I'm with you not because you're rich but that I love you. What are you calculating? Love is not about calculation. I'm a human being. I have a temper too. Go now. You're kicking me out because of this old, rotten apple? Fine. Joey. I was merely away for a leak and so many things happened. You go too. But this is my home. Can't you just go? OK... calm down. Michelle? I was in the room all the while. This apple symbolises our relationship. On the day we broke up, you... gave it to me. It has been with me for six years. Sorry. She didn't mean to break it. Does it hurt? I'm all right. What's happening? Why is it so noisy out there? That's the last flight taking off. We can no longer watch planes from here. The airport has changed, but not my heart. I want you to come back to me. I can give up everything. I just want to have the crystal apple in my heart back. Wo Peng. We're really... people from two different worlds. We've been trying to accommodate each other the past three years. How about we... end it? Michelle. Wo Peng, I have something to tell you. Get in first. Who are you? Cops. All from the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau. Remember Buffalo and his two sidekicks who ran away three years ago? They returned two days ago... and were all killed. And now they think I did it. But you've nothing to do with it! Of course. But they don't believe. Wo Peng, your place is very "clean." I can't even find a single knife. Of course you can't. I've turned over a new leaf long ago. Since when did you become so humorous? —You can't accuse him unjustly! —Michelle. I've something to tell you. You wanted to tell me something just now? You tell me first. They'll keep me at the station for at least forty-eight hours. So what? You'll be fine. Actually, Bill is a good man. Get back with him... is better than being with me. What are you talking about? They won't accuse me without evidence. If they're here, it means they already have some sort of evidence. I think I've been set up. I don't know how long this will drag on. I don't want to get you involved. Who am I to you? I won't leave you in times like this. Don't argue with me. Go back to him! Can we leave now, Brother Wo Peng? I'll go with you. Let's go. Very good! Thank you. Sorry... for throwing a tantrum last night. It's my fault. Why did that Japanese guy sign the contract so willingly? He has a name. Fine. I know you've helped me a lot this time. Thank you. I didn't. I just told him that... if he wants to find a business partner in Hong Kong, you're the one. Otherwise he might as well not do business in Hong Kong. That's exaggerating. There are lots of talented people here in Hong Kong. I said that on purpose... because I said something else on top of that. "Actresses like me..." "only go for men like Bill Kay if we're looking for boyfriends." "If not, we might as well stay single." He must be jumping mad upon hearing that. No. He said there will be progress when there's competition. He said he'll compete with you for me. Joey, let's forget what happened last night. I have something to tell you. So do I. You go ahead first. We've known each other for two years now, right? I remember once when I performed in New York... you went to watch the show. You were seated on the fifth seat in the first row. You stared at me the entire night. Later, you went backstage to shake my hand. After that, I was the one that went after you. But now I realised how good it feels to be wooed by a man. That Japanese guy is crazy about me. He makes me feel so important. But... that's not something I feel... when I'm with you. Say "yes" to him then. I knew you'd say such things out of jealousy! Don't worry. I didn't say "yes." Really? Why the sudden outburst of patriotism? No. I just want to tell you that... you've a competitor now. What did you want to tell me? Nothing. Now that I'm implicated in this case, don't force yourself. Go be with Bill. Did I say I'll go back to Bill? You have no future with me. —Are you dumping me? —Of course not. Then, it's settled. Let's get married soon. We'll take first class from Hong Kong to Rome. Then, Rome to Venice, Venice to Paris and from there to New York. Book two tickets for "Phantom of the Opera." I want the best seats. After the show, Michelle and I will return to Tokyo. To celebrate at the place we met. OK, I'll take care of them all. Thanks a lot. This journey will take me away for at least half a month. Why don't you take leave as well? To go dating? I don't want to go dating. You set your standards too high. I won't date unless I find somebody exactly the same as you. I think you should... you should go back to your brother's place to sleep. Michelle? Have you told Wo Peng? Let's talk in your room. Come on in. Moon, I'll drive you home later. Michelle, that's not fair to Wo Peng and I. Michelle! Michelle. I've made up my mind not to leave him at this time. I'll marry him the day after tomorrow. I hope you'll give us your blessing. What if he doesn't come back? I'll wait for him. Sorry, Bill. What happened? She chose Wo Peng. Why? I thought you... I don't want to talk about it! —Bill. —Leave me alone. Why did you choose him but not me? Michelle, I love you... Why didn't you choose me... Why him and not me... Why does the one whom I love doesn't love me? Why? But as long as you're happy... I'm willing to do anything for you. You deserve the woman you love most. Hello? Bill? Are you no longer in love with me? Joey? Where are you? Tell me. Do you still have feelings for me? What are you talking about? I know you don't love me. But I'm not willing to accept it... because I love you so much. If you dump me... I'll kill myself. Hey! Calm down, Joey. Where are you? I'll go there right away. That's not necessary! I'll cut off my fingers one by one and send them to you. Don't. Can you please calm down? I'll make you regret it for the rest of your life. Hello? Hello? Moon! What's the matter? Find out which hotel Joey is staying in. OK. Quickly. Do you have a guest by the name of Joey Tang? J-o-e-y T-a-n-g. Yes. Thanks. Thanks. It's about time. You've got to go. If anything happens to Joey, I'll not forgive myself. If you still love Michelle, get her back or you'll regret it. —Hello? —Tell him to come down quickly now! Who is it? My brother is waiting for you downstairs. Go. Don't worry. I'll help you look for Joey. Quickly. Bill. Joey. Come on in. Where have you been? I was drunk last night and talked nonsense. Sorry. No worries. What I said last night... was from the script in "The Untold Story III." It wasn't real. That means your acting skills has improved a lot. I was scared witless. Do you have to be sarcastic? Are you in a hurry? I'm in a hurry too. In fact, I came here... to tell you that... I like the feeling of being wooed. So, I've decided to return to Japan with that Japanese guy. Give me your blessings! You've my blessings. But I won't return the gifts you gave me. We're friends. Don't say such things. Remember my birthday then. Send me a birthday gift every year. I will. Definitely. —Bye. —Bye. Now the sky is cleared. Moon, thanks. I'll never forget you. I'm leaving. —Do they know how to drive? So slow! —It's all jammed! —The cars in front have moved forward. —OK, I'll move forward an inch. No need... I'll walk! The groom can't be late... Don't be late... Order two dozens of roses and send it to Joey's hotel. It's your birthday today? OK! My dear, happy birthday! Michelle. What happened? —Wo Peng is gone. —Where to? Michelle, I think I can't escape from the charges. Forget about marrying me. Bye. Boss, when should I start my eighty-eight-thousand-dollar job? Where's Brother Wo Peng? —I don't know. —A hundred grand! Where's he? I really don't know. —Ten million! One, two... —I know! Over there. In the car. Remember, ten million Lira. Come with me. Ten million... How much is ten million Lira? About forty thousand Hong Kong dollars. —Are you sure? —More or less. I've gotten the short end of the stick! Are you serious? You hid in the car to cry while your bride is feeling sad out there? You two are more compatible. Get off if you're a man. Come on! Marry her now! I've got to flee. How can I marry her? Why flee? Get a lawyer! If you don't have enough money, I'll help you. You're a good friend. —But why are you here? —To stop Michelle from marrying you. You told me to stay and marry her and now you're telling her not to marry me? What are you up to? Don't look at me. I know nothing. Bill! My sister has left. Where to? She's going back to the States to marry a black. Why a black? She loves you. Since you've won Michelle back, her duty is over. Are you my friend? Why didn't you stop her? Are you nuts? Rascal! Enough! You've beaten me up twice over my sister. Why did you let Moon go? You should have dragged her away. Are you still unaware of whom you really need? Actually, the person you need is Moon. I'm just a dream of yours from six years ago. I know you came here from Japan to try to woo me again... so that you won't live with any regrets. You've tried. If you let me choose again, I'll still stick to Wo Peng. Let our feelings... remain in our memories. Just like the old airport. Something we can reminisce about occasionally. That'd be better. You fought for me just once... but for Moon, you beat up your best friend twice. Ask yourself honestly. Who do you like most? Aren't you going to get her back? When it comes to matters of the heart, don't do anything you'd regret in future. Thank you. I give you two my blessings. Missus, you'll have to pay me another sixty thousand. I let you break our agreed rules today. OK. Darn you to hell, you bloody twerp! Moon! I was afraid the plane had taken off and I wouldn't get to see you anymore. Yes, you almost couldn't. I was stopped by a policeman and missed my flight. A policeman? Yes. He said I was littering. Miss, why are you littering? I thought you didn't care about me all along. I do. You're right. There's more than one crystal apple in this world. I need you.
