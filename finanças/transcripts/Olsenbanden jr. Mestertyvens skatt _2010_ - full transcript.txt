Come, children! Now, now! Stop acting like children! It's perfectly natural to wonder where we come from. Who are we? Where do we live? And what are we doing here? Life on Earth originated in the oceans. Take this trilobite, "Little Ivar". This arthropod lived in the ocean 300 million years ago. We are all descended from this fascinating little creature. Teacher? Yes, Valborg? Already? Everyone pull out your apples. Herman and Ingrid, did you bring an extra apple? Give my best to your parents. We thank you for your contribution to our unfortunate orphans. From dad. Thank you, Herman! Give him my best. If any of you need to use the restroom, please follow me. Don't forget to thank me. You aren't going to eat that, are you? Where's that rotten apple from? The garbage? He got it at the fruit stand. I'll bet he begged for it. We get the fruit no one else wants. No one wants rotten fruit! And no one wanted you either, did they? That's why you live in an orphanage. What do you know? Plenty! I heard Egon was so ugly when he was born, that his mom didn't want to see him! Stop, or else... What? You'll tell your parents? That's right. You don't have any! You rotten little apple! Egon Olsen! You'll get house arrest for this! THE JUNIOR OLSEN GANG AND THE MASTER THIEF It'll be good to see him again. Miss Pirkedal won't be thrilled. It was all Biff's fault. Come on. We have to hurry! Egon, welcome to freedom! How are you? The train station. Hurry! Why? I don't have time to explain. Move! Full speed ahead, Benny! Out of the way! What is it, Egon? Stop talking! Pedal! What's wrong with the wheel? No! Hang on, Egon! How did it go? You're hopeless! You miserable amateur! That bike has worked all summer. You always screw up! I couldn't know the wheel was loose. I can forget about that train. Train? I...have a grandfather. In Fredrikstad. How did you find that out? Manager Hartvigsen had the boys doing gymnastics. I had house arrest. Better to watch than to participate. Sure, but then something happened. Hartvigsen got a visitor. This man seemed interested in me. House arrest. He's up there. Noses to the ground! 100 pushups. No slackers! I snuck downstairs to see what was going on. And found out something about myself. Egon Olsen. What do you know about that boy? We know nothing about his parents. Someone left him in a basket on the town hall steps. On the town hall steps? That's what he said. That fellow, Hartvigsen's brother, works at a rest home in Fredrikstad. A rest home? Where he has a special boarder. Eugen Olsen, a wealthy old character who has hidden a vast fortune. The old man talks in his sleep. But I can't get him to tell me where the money is stashed. It was a fly! You know I hate blowflies. The old man thinks he's Egon's grandfather. He's written letters, asking Egon for help. Egon hasn't gotten any letters. I've confiscated all of them. But this grandfather is a slick operator. Make sure Egon Olsen never sets foot in Fredrikstad! Now you know why I have to get to Fredrikstad as soon as possible. This is fantastic, Egon! What do you mean? That you suddenly have a grandpa. It doesn't matter that I missed that train. In order to help him, I'm going to need help from you. No, we can't. Why not? Have you forgotten? We're going to that children's camp in Eidsvoll. Chief Deputy Commissioner Hermansen and Under Deputy Commissioner Holm. These two will be our hosts at this lovely holiday resort. Miss Pirkedal, allow me... Holm, what am I to do with you? Holm... We have so much to look forward to! We have the Eidsvoll Building, Eidsvoll bath house, and last, but not least... Henrik Wergeland! He grew up at the rectory there. We will follow in his footsteps. We did that last year. I beg your pardon? It's boring to follow in the same footsteps every year Wergeland? Boring? The man who wrote: We are also a nation Though small, only an ell tall We do so love our fatherland And we are many over all Our heart knows, our eye sees How beautiful Norway is... Exactly. But there are many beautiful places in Norway. Maybe we should try one of them? What do you mean? How about Fredrikstad? The police has a children's camp there too. Yes, that's true. And it is beautiful there! We can bathe in salt water and fresh water, and go canoeing! And visit farms, and pet cows. Once my entire hand disappeared up a cow's... We will go where Miss Pirkedal wants us to go. Thank you, Hermansen. Eidsvoll, children, is nothing less than a gem. I thought Eidsvoll was the cradle of liberty? 1814, Independence Day, democracy and all that. And democracy means the majority decides, right? Yes, sure, of course... Shouldn't we practice democracy here? Let's vote on whether we should go to Fredrikstad...or Eidsvoll. Fredrikstad! Fredrikstad! Fredrikstad! Eidsvoll! No! Fine. Those who want to go to Eidsvoll, raise your hand. And those opposed? Who wants to go to Fredrikstad? Holm... Kjell? Want to go watch the new Tarzan movie tonight? I can't. Aunt Agot has invited us for dinner. Herman, I can go with you after all! Fredrikstad it is! Well done, Egon. This will be great! And you'll get to meet your grandpa. It'll be like... Like Christmas! Right! What's so great about some old man? If he's rich, maybe you'll get a share. Hi, Syvertsen! Hi, Tutta! Maybe you'll get rich enough to buy Syvertsen's icecream van! What is it with him? I don't know. Lights out! A single sound, and you can forget about Eidsvoll. But we're... Never mind. Torvald. We can't let him know we're going to Fredrikstad. OK? Whatever you say, Egon! Hey? Yeah? What would you do if you suddenly got a grandpa? That's hard to say. I know. Someone left him in a basket on the town hall steps. We know nothing about his parents. BYE, Egon! Bye! Not so fast, young man. Behave, or you'll end up back in house arrest. Let's make it to Fredrikstad before sunset. Fredrikstad? Boo! Hurry! Coming! Well done! He was easy to scare. Off we go! Wasn't it great that Uncle Alfred could drive us? Is he going to drive the whole way in reverse? Apparently reverse is the only gear that works. But even though we're going backwards, we're moving forwards. What is Dynamite Harry doing here? Miss Pirkedal let him come. And I borrowed Uncle Harald's backpack. He left behind some powerful explosives! I can't wait to stretch my legs. Open the door. Allow me, Uncle Alfred. Holm, what am I to do with you? Sorry, boss. There we go! Miss Pirkedal, let me get your bag. No! What a long ride! Speaking of rides... Water is always worth waiting for. If you'd like me to paddle you around, I'm at your service! I only like paddling in Eidsvoll. Allow me. Klutz! You hit the head on the nail. Holm is an incurable klutz. Allow me! I only meant to help. Stay away from me! Kjell, guess what I'm looking most forward to. What, Valborg? Canoeing with you. That sounds great. And imagine how romantic! I'd love to canoe with you, Ingrid. Thanks, but I'm going to the farm. Have you ever lit a match behind a cow when it farts? The flame shoots from here to the moon! I got it for Christmas. You can borrow it. A bow tie? Why would I want to borrow that? So you can look a little classy when you meet your grandpa. I don't care howl look! This is... It's... Yeah? Knock it off! Tomorrow we're going canoeing. Here we are. If we paddle down this river, we'll end up in Fredrikstad. The rest home is in Old Town. We can paddle straight in here. It won't be easy to get away. I have a plan. Tiptop, Egon! Is it dangerous? Everything's planned and perfected. But I promised Valborg I'd canoe with her tomorrow. She gets so... You're going to wake everyone up! Sorry. Sometimes love has to yield to the harsh realities of life. Kjell, keep lookout. We are also a nation Though small, only an ell tall... Ready, Kjell? Yes! No! I promised Egon. Don't you want to canoe with me? Do something! I want to share everything with you, but... What Kjell is trying to say, is he isn't very good at canoeing. What if the canoe tips over? Yes, with precious cargo like you, I'd never forgive myself. So you just want me to be safe? You got it! Herman, I can share a canoe with you after all! Ready? Fall in! Two rows, one arm'slength apart! Move, I was here first! Ingrid, aren't you petting cows? I'm willing to give you a chance. Aboutface! Forward march! You and I and we two Sailed in a canoe The canoe stopped And out we hopped Singing ohso merry We ran into a ferry Boy were we glad we had life jackets on! Two and two in each canoe. Ready? Hand me that port...starboard... That oar, Holm! Time to put our best sea leg forward! Cast away! That creep Herman! Forget about him. We have a more important task. Follow me, Holm. It's now or never. Now what, Holm? A leak. Do something, Holm! Help! Help! Don't just call for help! Hello! I'll save you, dad! Herman, a man of action. Grab my oar! Holm, you are simply a walking... ...disaster! Do something! Don't just tread water. Sorry, Ingrid. You just wait! Is it cold, Valborg? Where are they going? Follow them! I finally get Ingrid on my own, and dump her overboard? Sometimes love has to yield to the harsh realities of life, Benny. His rest home is called Aftensol. Let's do this! If this doesn't get him out, I don't know what will! Firstclass rosin! Do as planned. Keep going! Run! Hey! I'll get you! You just wait, you snotty brats! Hi there! Hello. You selling lottery tickets? No... I'm here to see my grandfather. You wouldn't happen to be Egon, would you? How did you know that? I'm...a friend of your grandfather's. Have a seat. What's this? If I told you it's an old hot air balloon, would you believe me? No. I didn't think so. A balloon? And I'm a retired balloon pilot, if you can believe that. Can it fly? Sure. I just have to sew this. But it's not easy, and my arthritis doesn't make it any easier. What was that racket? It was some young hooligans! Did you catch them? No, but next time... Come on. We have more important matters. Hurry along. Your grandfather has been waiting for you. That was close! This is too exciting for me. You should have gone to that farm. I'm sure they're bored. Harry, what are those matches for? Give them to me this instant! Wasn't that swell, teacher? I hope he's wearing the bow tie. The clothes make the man. Who are you? I'm Egon. Egon? Finally! I've been waiting so long! Eugen. Egon. I wasn't always bedridden like this. I fell a few months ago. My back seized up. Egon? Egon... You've become a handsome young man. Not bad at all! But why didn't you come sooner? I've sent so many letters. They never made it. Did he say anything else? Yes. You talk in your sleep. That's it! That scoundrel has tried to feed me sleeping pills. So I would sleep a lot and talk even more. I don't think I revealed anything. About what? About a little treasure out there waiting for me. Get me out of here, so I can find it! That's why I sent for you. Because you need my help? Yes. That's why we have family. So we can help each other. So that's why you sent for me? What about... About me? Here I come with your vitamin pills. My money... I have to get my money... You sure do. Where is it? Far, far away. How far? Pole... Pole? The North Pole. Visiting grandpa? Let go of him, you scoundrel! Tell me where the money is, or we'll make the boy pay! We have to escape. Do you have a plan? Get ready! Ready for what? Here he comes! Comes? Push! If the rope breaks, jump to the side! Open the door! Open up! No! Nor no! I've got him! No! Bravo, Solveig! That's my girl! You look handsome, hanging there. See you youknowwhere. Count on me. Only one patch left. What a grandpa! Eugen Olsen, it's a pleasure. Benny Kjell. Great, Egon. We have to get out of here! Come on, boys! Come on! Hey! Out of the way! Watch out! Move! What are they thinking? Outoftowners! Quick, Benny! The gate! Hit the brakes! The whole town is after us! What do we do with him? You just wait! The Hartvigsen brothers know we're at that camp. What about help from the police? The police? No, keep them out of this. You two go back. He and I will camp in the woods. Egon, Egon... You're no fool. Why haven't you contacted me before? And my parents, what about them? When you were a newborn, your parents had to run off to Denmark. They left Lillesand in a fishing boat. I was supposed to follow with you. But then... What? A horrible storm came up. The boat went down. They were both... They were both lost at sea. There I sat, with you, suddenly all alone. So you dumped me at town hall and ran off! I figured that was best. I didn't want you to end up like the rest of our family! End up like what? What do you mean? We have been a family of thieves for many generations. My father too? Yes. He was an honest burglar. Safes were his specialty. No way! He was...one of the best. And you? I'm retired. Egon's grandpa might not like hot dogs. Not all old people do. He'll have to take what he gets. Why did Egon Olsen go to Oslo? We don't know. He must have said something? No. He suddenly got homesick. And so am I. If anything else happens, even the tiniest thing, I am going to blow my top! Holm... Do something! No, Holm! Dip your zipper, zip your dipper... What's it called? "Close your zipper" Why didn't you say so? Thank you, Holm. Kjell! Oh, no! Good you didn't stick the loaf in there. Nothing is happening. Let me see. Ants! The place is crawling with ants! I hate nature. We should pave the entire country. Look! His friends! Say something, Egon. I don't want to talk about it. No, our family isn't much to be proud of. But there is something. Have you heard of Ole Høiland? Ole Høiland? The Master Thief? I've read about him. He robbed the Bank of Norway in 1835. Stole 64,100 speciedaler. He must have been quite a character. He was. And Ole Høiland is also your greatgreatgreatgrandfather We're all his descendants. Hi! Hi. It's just us. We brought hot dogs. Make sure they're well done! We can bring you something else tomorrow. Tomorrow? We'll be on our way to Oslo. My grandson is going to help me find our family fortune. We'd better be heading back. Before anyone misses us. Good luck. Kjell? Thanks. That family fortune... Is that the money from the Bank of Norway? Yes. Ole was sent to prison. But a large amount was never found. We searched for that treasure for years. One day my pipe broke, and I remembered an old family keepsake. It's been in our family since Ole's time. This. Has that pipe been his? When I tried to smoke it, it was clogged. So I had to try to clean it. Ole wasn't just a jailbird, he was a real jokester too. Read this. "The money from the bank, where did it go, my friend?" "Will the treasure near the cave see light of day again?" "At fortress Akershus search long and well enough." "Just remember, Henrik Wergeland wrote poems and used snuff." Now we know where to look! It sounds like a riddle. Yes. What was that? Egon, I think we should head to Oslo tonight. Agree? A car better come pretty soon. I'm exhausted. You'll be fine. You have strong arms. How do you know that? It runs in the family. Are you smiling? Listen! Syvertsen! He's a friend. An icecream man. Don't tell him about our plans! Hi! What are you doing here at this hour? This is... Eugen Olsen. Good evening. I found him down the street. He missed the last bus to Oslo. And so did I, so we joined each other. Want a ride? Here we are! I almost fell asleep. I don't know what you're up to, Egon. You're a good boy. I can trust you. If you need a place to sleep, you can stay here. But you have to be out by 9 a.m. Deal? We can have a lot of fun together. I can't wait to teach you some of my tricks. Finally a whole night without worrying about talking in my sleep. Good night... Grandpa. What did you say? Good night. Spain, Solveig... It won't be long now, my girl. Spain... You can't steal Syvertsen's van! We're just borrowing it! Look out! Don't disturb me! It's dangerous to drive without glasses! Wergeland was Chief Archivist. He had an office here. Did he and Ole ever meet? Henrik was fascinated by him. After all, he only stole from the rich. And gave to the poor? I guess, now and then. They're already here! We have to get rid of them! His office was up there. A good place to start. Hooray for Independence Day! "At fortress Akershus search long and well enough.“ "Just remember: Henrik Wergeland wrote poems and used snuff.“ Find anything? This was in a secret compartment. Wergeland's snuffbox! This is exciting! No, I can't read it without my glasses. You read it. Did you take his glasses? Solveig? You made it! Let's see how this looks through Wergeland's glasses. It was a fly! "Like writing in the sand, with time on your hand." "Where Ole sat tight on his last night. Henrik" "Where Ole sat tight on his last night"? Where was that? Yes! It was in a tower here, just down the hill. "Like writing in the sand"? You'll have to figure that out. It's too steep for me. I'll wait here. We can't get down there while he's sitting there. "Where Ole sat tight on his last night." "Like writing in the sand"? Did Wergeland write on sandpaper? What do you say? Should we get rid of him, once and for all? Good idea. Then we can focus on the kid. Help! Egon, help me! Stop! Grandpa! How did that go? Are you all right, grandpa? I think so. What happened? I don't know. Suddenly I was flying down the hill. Did you find anything in the tower? No, nothing there. But... You can walk! I...I can walk. I can walk! The collision must have fixed my back. I've been waiting for this. Egon, en garde! Gotcha! So, you didn't find any clues in the tower? No. No. Egon, come here. When that cement dries, my imprint will be there forever! That deserves a signature, don't you think? “E... "Like writing in the sand..." Yes, that must be it! Something is written on the walls. Look! "O" for Ole, and "H" for Høiland. Let me borrow your pipe. Yes! There is the cave where he hid. That must be where the treasure is buried. Let's go! No! You aren't going anywhere. Back on your feet again? You won't get to enjoy it. Except that you can march into the cell on your own two feet! Look at these two killjoys. You'd almost think you were related. No point in yelling. No one can hear you through these walls. Fall in! Two rows! Hi, Ingrid! Sleep well? Here's to you, jerk! Silence! Due to Miss Pirkedal's unfortunate health condition, we will cut short this visit and return to Oslo. It's hopeless. No one has managed to break out of here. Except Ole, of course. How did he do it? He dug down, under the wall. It's over two meters thick. How long did that take? Over a year. Face it. We've lost. You're the one who's lost. I didn't have anything to lose. Except you. What do you mean? Spain. You heard me. You talked in your sleep last night. We just met, and you already plan to leave me. It's Solveig. Her arthritis. She needs a warmer climate to get better We thought we could buy a little house in Spain for that money. Poor Solveig. That won't happen now. I've got it! Wergeland helped Ole hide his map. Maybe we could get some help from Wergeland too? Egon Olsen! I'm itching to get my hands on that scoundrel! No one can run away like that unpunished! He'll get coaled over the hauls! Hauled over the coals, boss. That too! I'm not doing this for you. This is for Solveig. Remember that! You'd give Ole a run for his money! I don't want Egon to get in trouble. We have to report the van... Hey, stop, for crying out loud! My car! Stop! Stop! Hey! Wait! Hello! Syvertsen, have you lost your mind? My icecream van! Not now, Syvertsen. We're looking for Egon Olsen. We have to get our priorities straight. Egon took off in my icecream van! Why didn't you say so? Drive! There they are, boss! Follow me. Surround them, Holm! Yes, boss. There's no one here, boss! Boss? They must have headed into the wilderness on foot. Off we go. But what about the children? And me? Calm down. Syvertsen will take care of you. Count on me! Free ice cream for everyone! Holm, Holm... Careful. No one knows what dangers lurk in the wilderness. This is where he hid. Not exactly comfortable, but good enough for Ole. Good enough for me, too. Quick! This Way! Here's the cave. Finally! We're here. North is here... So it's 50 E that way. 50 "E"? What does "E" mean? E stands for...Expect. He expects us to walk 50 meters in the direction of the arrow. One, two... Three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Isn't this the Hartvigsen brothers' car? We have to go into the woods and help Egon. Look! Where are they going? Let's find out. Come on! Wait for me! Hello? Boys? Hey! Where are you going? But... Hello? We have to get them away from there! I have an idea. Take off your suspenders. Are you sure we will find our way back, boss? When the wild calls, I am in my proper element. What was that? That was an owl, boss. I just wanted to test your botany skills. Zoology skills, boss. We'll test them some other time. NOW! Like a needle in a haystack! Quiet. Someone's coming! Biff and his gang! Quick! Darn it! We have to get rid of them. Where did they go? Do you have anything powerful, Harry? I'm ready. Go ahead. Maybe we should go back? What, are you chicken? Biff, wait! Mommy! Look at them run! Excellent, Harry! I found something! We've hit the bed rock. We can't dig any further. This must be the wrong place. We can't stay here. I don't get it. Ole was quite the joker, but he wouldn't fool his own family. They're back! My buddies! Hi! Hello, Egon! "E"? I don't understand. The fifth letter in the alphabet? Wergeland's song. Wergeland? "We are also a nation, Though small, only an ell tall..." "Only an ell tall"! Bravo, boys! Of course, "E" stand for Ell! They used that measurement in Wergeland's day! How long is an ell? From your elbow to your fingertips. About 60 centimeters. 47, 48, 49, so! Here it is! This is too slow. The Hartvigsens will be back any minute. Remember that Tarzan movie we saw last year? Yes, it was super! Make the same kind of booby trap. If it's good enough for Tarzan, it's good enough for us. Dig, Kjell! But... Finally! I'm frozen. Good job, Kjell. You can go up to the others. Where are we? I know where we are! The police! We're walking in circles, boss. No, we're circling in Egon Olsen. Should we take a breather? You breathe, while I rest. Time to move on. Come! What was that? Careful, Holm. Holm, I'm right behind you. Are the beasts behind us? I don't know, boss! Dad! Herman, thank God! We're saved! Where is Miss Pirkedal? I don't know. We're lost. Children? Where are the children? Holm, don't just stand there! Help! Holm! Miss Pirkedal! Holm, she needs support! Look at that! Holm, you have to... Holm! Boss? Look! Here it is! The money from the Bank of Norway! Am I dreaming? Miss us? It's about time nature had something nice to offer. Hand it over. Come on. Don't... Come on. I guess you'd better have it. Good luck. What? I said: Have a nice trip! He“) me! Let me down! Each man to himself. Don't forget you're my brother! Out of my way! Move! Blame! Bjarne, help me! We're tougher than Tarzan! He isn't so cocky anymore. Get me down from here! They got what they deserved. We need to get Hermansen and Holm. I'll handle that. Excellent, Harry! Get to it. This is powerful stuff. This will be fun. It isn't dangerous, is it? Where are you going? We have to hide the money before the police get here. And then? It's Solveig. She's coming to get me. I've grown real fond of you, Egon, but... I have to go. You see... Everything is planned and perfected. I'm sure you'll be happy in Spain. They say oranges grow on the trees down there. Take care, my boy. Get going. Don't leave the lady waiting. Heads u p! Will we never get out of this horrible forest? We're saved! That way, Holm! Let me down! It will be a pleasure. Hey, there are ants here! Stop! Sorry, this is the only way down. OK, fine, I admit it! We were after the old man's money. I smell mischief brewing, Holm. It's a joy for the long arm of the law to stop scoundrels like you. That boy isn't completely innocent. He and the old man have found Ole Høiland's treasure. The money from the Bank of Norway? They dug it up right there. Holy Chinaman! Holm... Do you know what this means? I see a promotion in my future! Is this yours? I thought it was yours. Perhaps it is. Where is the money you dug up, and that old gentleman? The money was his. He's probably gone back to Fredrikstad. Holm, we have no time to lose! We must send out a bulletin. Finally a promotion! Look, what fun! A hot air balloon! Grandpa! There he is! Who? What? Where? The old man! He's running off with the money! Holm, surround that balloon! The rope is stuck! They'll get caught! It's a granny knot, Solveig! Do you have a knife? I'm going to... Open the door! Holm, the door! Holm, what are you waiting for? The handle is gone. Egon... Good work, Torvald! It got it untied! Can't you handle finding the handle, Holm? There he goes. That's what's good about family. We help each other. Come on, boys. You are under arrest! In the name of the law... of the heavens... This is for you, Egon! Good bye, my boy! Have a nice trip! Subtitles: Nick Norris
