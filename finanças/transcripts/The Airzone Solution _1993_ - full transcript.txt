(sirens wailing) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The quality of the air that we all breathe ultimately effects the quality of our lives. But what sort of life is it when you spend most of it scrabbling to put on your atmosphere mask to stop yourself choking? Air pollution levels have risen rapidly over recent years and continue to increase. Doctors report an alarming rise in the incidents of cancers and serious chest infections and fear other diseases could be linked to the deterioration of the environment. It's an issue which forced itself onto the political agenda several years ago. Up till now nothing seems to have improved. But it could be about to change. Earlier this year, amid much controversy, the government awarded a contract to clean up the environment to the giant AirZone Corporation. They promised a major technological breakthrough. But do we need more technology in a world already suffocating from it? Shouldn't the government be changing public policy and the way we live our lives rather than looking to the private sector for solutions? - It's not a bad start, Al. But we both know that you'll need more than fancy phrases and stock footage. - We have complete faith in the AirZone Corporation's ability to improve significantly the air quality, and what's more, please, let me finish. What's more, I believe that they're the only people with the expertise and the resources to make, within the next few years, the wearing of masks a thing of the past. - Right, that's enough. - But you haven't seen it all yet. - You told me that it wasn't finished. - Well no, but-- - Then you mustn't have done what you know you must do. - Oliver, I asked you here for your-- - For my advice, yes I know. Look, perhaps you need to hear what you already know. What I think both of us have always known in one way or another. This is a piece of television which honors everything that I ever taught you. Even that insipid old turncoat Sam Flint at BriTen News might recognize this as the work of one raised in the shadow of the great Oliver Threthewey. But flattering me is not enough. You must grab the issue by its roots and then shake it clear in the daylight. For all to see. - That's what I intend to do. - I know. And I shall be watching. - And the main stories this afternoon on BriTen News, the government is accused of turning its back on its responsibility for the environment. The opposition says the AirZone cleanup contract is nothing short of private profit out of public misery. And England are two matches away from a place in the World Cup final. We'll have updates throughout the day, but now the weather with Arnie Davis. - Thank you very much Quentin, I'm glad see the acne is better. Now, I know they say that every cloud has a silver lining but you'd be hard pushed to find one today. Hasn't it been awful? And we're in for more of the same, I'm afraid, so keep those masks handy. They're a must. I know they're not particularly wonderful but treat them as a fashion accessory, hm? You wouldn't be seen without one. Now what's the weather pattern for today. Hi toxic levels I'm afraid, combined with ozone depletion, which means you're going to get rather hot under the collar. Air quality, very poor. Talking of patterns, thank you very much Mrs. Emily Jones of Burton-on-Trent for this wonderful jumper, just look at it, it'd brighten up any dull day, wouldn't it. Unfortunately I can't wear it because the blue interferes with the chroma key behind me. Technical reason, we don't need to worry about that. Anyway, that's all for me, and my eye in the sky with the big transponders and all the information of Eurosat 57. I'll be back out to the nine o'clock news. Until then, bye for now, shall we dance! - Off air, thank you very much everyone. Good program. - What do you think of the show so far? Toxic, Toxic! (woman laughing) - By this government. So what we want to see the government-- - [Reporter] You're not convinced by AirZone's promises? - No, we're not. I mean the government effectively has thrown up its hands and given AirZone an open check to deal with a problem that should be it's, the government's, top priority. - [Reporter] AirZone have refused any filming inside their plant. It would appear there's still some way to go before they're ready to reveal their solution. Or is there? (suspenseful music) - Good luck. - [Reporter] Some people are beginning to openly question whether the government has simply bought some breathing space while the country suffocates. - There's no quick-fix answer. We at AirZone have been given a crucial task to achieve and we're not in the business of failing. We're currently working on a number of projects and are confident that the breakthrough will emerge from one of them. (bell ringing) But until it's finalized there's no point in raising people's hopes. - Who is it? - It's me. We should have a password. - How about shit-scared. Were you followed? - No. I don't think so. - How's your mole? - She's, she's fine. - Late again? - Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. The traffic, you know. Every time there's a toxic alert. - I hope she knows her stuff. - She does. - Am I doing this alone? - No, but it's just-- - Are you and your Global Concern chums backing out on me here? - No, but it might be the government, MI5-- - Oh yes, national security, now there's a nice cozy blanket to hide your dirty washing under. That's a definite sign something unpleasant and underhand's going on, wouldn't you say? - Well look, why don't we just wait until we get an official reply from the Department of the Environment? - Is this what you've been coaxing your little mole to put her job on the line for? Official bullshit from the government? Look, Stanwick. Antony. You know we have to find the truth, I can't just drop the program now, we're almost there. We make a good team, don't we? The hack and the-- - Eco-nutter? - Let's not lose sight of what we're doing here and what we are up against. - Rachel Lonsdale. Looks like a perfect candidate for the next stage. - When's the baby due? - September. - You make sure you wear that mask, eh? - So, any problems? Mainframe on the second floor. - Service lift, button coded green, very appropriate. - But any of the terminals should get you in. Security locks? - Key. You're very convincing. - Ah, Janet. - I hope you're on good form. - Hm? - We're relying on you, very dull news day. - Sparkle, sparkle. - [Antony] Once you're in? - Access file AirZone Solution. The hard drive will take the security lockout codes from here. - Good luck. - We're going to find out what they're up to. - However bad it may be. - Better make way for the star of the show. - Some of us need more makeup than others, I'm afraid. My turn. How are you, Cindy? (suspenseful music) (electronic beeping) - Come on, come on. - [Quentin] And what about this AirZone story, what do you think you can get out of this? - Well, quite a bit, I'd really be interested in covering the forum. (Ellie gasping) Thank you. Thank you, very much. - Pleasure was all mine. (suspenseful music) - Oh, god. Oh my god. (alarm blaring) (dramatic music) - Come on. (suspenseful music) - Rachel? My god. They've started already. - Get me out of this. - Good evening. - [Recording] You have entered a high security area. Wear oxygen masks at all times. - That's enough mickey-taking from me and my big transponders. I'll be back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Until then-- (Al gasping) From me... - Arnie, Arnie what's the matter? Arnie? - That's all from me... Right, coming to Praz. Take us now, take us now, Praz. (alarm blaring) - Hot chocolate. You OK? - Yeah, I'm all right now, honest. - Well we can forget about Al Dunbar's irritating little documentary now, can't we. - Perhaps Sir Richard Allenby might not be quite so pleased. - The project is still top secret, that will placate him. My concern is how your people let the girl escape. - We'll get her. (Arnie whistling) - Mac. - Secretary of State. - Sir Richard, I'm honored by-- - You know why I'm here, Robin. This whole Dunbar business has been allowed to get out of control. You should have anticipated it. Mustn't happen again, Robin. We didn't award AirZone the air cleanup contract just to get the government into trouble. Your people will pick up the pieces. I've arranged for that because the police leak like sieves. And MI5... Well, you contain the situation, Robin. I'm relying on you. Mac. - If I'm not mistaken that was an official warning from the Secretary of State for the Environment. He doesn't get up early for fun, you know. - Find Rachel. - You ready? â™ª You gotta have glass - I've got to get back to work. - Let me get my tie on. - No more funny turns? - No, I'm perfectly back to normal. - Good. No, no, I'll see you in the car. - You know what you have to do, don't you? - No, I... This isn't happening to me. This is not happening. - You really have no choice, you know. Remember. - [Ellie] Oh... Lovely. - Saw him again, you know. - Who? - Was in the house with me. He was just there for a few seconds. Then he wasn't. - Are you cracking up? (car horn beeping) - "Do you fancy going out for dinner tonight?" (suspenseful music) - Key. - Key? - Remember, the key is in the jar. Buried. (door knocking) - Everything all right? - Fine, everything's fine. - Government guidelines, the new ones. Just glance through them when you can, OK? - Polly, me want pow-wow with big chief Sam. - He heap busy and liable to chew ears off if you waste his time. Sam, it's Ellie. - Piss off and leave me alone? - Al Dunbar was your dreaded mentor, wasn't he? Well the stock pictures are pretty crappy. Got anything in the album of Sam Flint's greatest hits? - You're desperate, because you're risking my wrath. Al Dunbar was a mad bastard who took too much notice of that old maniac Oliver Threthewey. If I did have a photograph of Al, MI5 probably would have confiscated it by now. Your fraught editor demands a tape in 10 minutes. - Thanks. - Hello, it's Arnie. (chuckling) Yes. Chicken tikka pasanda, onion bhaji and plenty of... - [Reporter] Al Dunbar was found dead early this morning. His body was discovered nearly 25 miles from his home, in an area of industrial wasteland south of London. Medical reports indicate he suffered heart failure brought on by respiratory difficulties. - But now the weather with Arnie Davis. - Oh, good evening, I was just thinking about a funny thing that happened today. Well, not so much funny as strange, really. Strange, but true nonetheless. Anyway that's enough tittle-tattle for me when all you've been hearing all day is the rattle tattle at the rain pouring down. Come on Arnie, you're saying, where's it all going to end? It's, Dunbar, Al Dunbar. I saw him dead. - I know he's dead-- - Not on the news. It was him I saw dead last night in the studio when I froze. And today I told you. He was in the flat. He spoke to me. What the hell is happening to me? - So, another Chinese takeaway bites the dust. Seismic alert, noodle overdose, seismic alert! - 'Ave I been scintillatin' company? - Yes, you are the man of my dreams. - I think I've hardly had a drop and I feel zonked. - Well you've had a hard day. - Well, seeing dead people takes it out of you. Something's got in here, Ellie. I keep seeing a dead man, and I don't, I don't even know who he was when he was alive. - Arnie. Can I be selfish? Look, you're not going mad. Something really strange is going on here. And I need your help to understand what it is. So if you just tell me everything from the start I know we can work this out together. And then we can just get back to being that crazy, hopelessly in love couple. - Not what I expected. - No police. Good. Come on. (suspenseful music) OK, let's try it then. Key hidden in jar, right? Well look, did he show you a map or what? Don't worry, I'll do it. (suspenseful music) Looks like an offline edit setup. (telephone ringing) - [Robin] Archer. We now have authorization to clear the tapes out. - [MacNamara] No sign of Rachel. - No, tomorrow morning will not do. What about our contact? - Antony Stanwick. - They must have had emergency plans, follow him, second-guess him. Antony Stanwick. The man from Global Concern? - He's been pestering Sir Richard Allenby's office for an audience ever since the government awarded the AirZone contract. - I'll give him an audience. - Remember what the Secretary said. - If Stanwick gets his hands on Rachel they can forget the next three general elections at least. AirZone has been hired to preserve a way of life and solve a problem. In that context there are no other options. - All I'm suggesting is that we don't take unnecessary risks it's a matter of marketing, public perception-- - Thank you, MacNamara. - I mean smoke hangs over our cities. Rivers are drying up and sea levels are rising, threatening to flood the East Coast. - We at AirZone have been given a monumental task. We are confident of achieving a revolutionary breakthrough. But we will not be in position to tell you our exact plans until our tests are complete. - We are particularly worried about one aspect of AirZone's operations. The new type of toxic incinerators. We have statistics which prove the incinerators are actually leading to an increase in toxic emissions. - [Reporter] What statistics? - The government's own statistics. They're there for anyone to read. But nobody bothers. I mean the incinerators have a basic design fault. They don't burn the toxins off at a high enough temperature. So they're being released into the atmosphere and in even more volatile and lethal form. - Interesting. Inconclusive. Hints at something scary going on, but what? - That's what he was trying to find out. - How do you know? - A company gets a contract to clean up pollution in the air. - Lots of jobs, very popular with the unions. - Only the air gets worse. - Says eco-man Stanwick. I did an item on him once and Global Concern. Bit alarmist, but harmless though. - Like me. (bell ringing) - Who the hell? - Al Dunbar? (bell ringing) - Can I help you? - Do you have any right to be here? - Probably more than you. - It's a court order. - Authorization to remove AirZone property. Wonder what that could be. There's nothing belonging to AirZone here. - [Computer] Welcome to Eurosat S57 meteorological database. Government files, public domain. - Caught ya! - Yes, I am perfectly all right, and no, I haven't been talking to any more dead bodies today. - I wasn't checking up on you. - Sorry. - Do you want to hear my news? I got the job. You know, the end of next week. Lots of big wigs, government delegation. Miss Perfect herself, Robin Archer, and moi! Asking always ze awkward questions at the forum, ja? Look. I've got a lot of dirt on AirZone, if you're interested. Al Dunbar would have been. - [Announcer] Telephone call for Ellie in the newsroom. - [Arnie] I, um... So, the only way we can hope for our next breath of fresh air is if the winds pick up and blow away these large areas of toxic cloud. As you can see from the chart, the main centers of pollution are quite clearly located in these three areas. By a strange coincidence these are where AirZone's latest toxic waste incinerators are situated. Now I'd be the first person to wish them every success in their stated aim of reducing toxic emissions by the end of the decade. But I'd make sure your atmosphere mask has been well checked because it looks as if you're going to need it for quite a time yet. And if you think old Arnie's being a miserable old scare monger, then take a look at the statistics. This column represents AirZone's average levels of emission last year and this one shows this year's. Now you've probably spotted that this year's is bigger, in fact it's 11% bigger. Another of Arnie's jokes, you think? - What the hell's he up to? - Stay safe, keep that mask handy. - Archer. The weatherman? - Do you know who I've just had on the phone giving me earache because of your little outburst? - I'm all ears. - Only the INRA. That's the Independent News Regulatory Authority, Arnie. - Sam, it's all there in the public record for anyone to see, I don't see what you're so worried about. - I don't care if it's printed on the back of cornflake packets, the point is you had no right to use your weather forecast as a political soapbox. - Oh, as long as it's nice and frothy, you don't mind, eh? - Arnie, you're a great weatherman. We love you, the punters adore you, damn it we probably wouldn't have an audience without you. - You're right. - But you can't go on the air and start laying into companies like that, particularly not big corporations like AirZone. We're into news here, not propaganda. - Propaganda? It's not propaganda, it's the truth for crying out loud! Since AirZone were awarded that cleanup contract the emissions have gone up by 11%. And this is the company we're asking to make us a better world? - Look you've obviously got an ax to grind about this but I'm not interested-- - Oh, you're not interested, you are a news editor, and you're not interested. - And you're a weatherman. - Oh and weathermen aren't supposed to think, is that it? Look Sam, I'm amazed that you can't see that this is a big story. Or maybe you don't want to. - Look, I'll decide what's news and what isn't around here, OK? It might interest you to know that 30 seconds into your little diatribe the INRA got a call from Whitehall. - Well that proves I hit a nerve. - Which proves that the people who renew our franchise are severely pissed off when they switch on and hear a one-sided, unbalanced editorial during a weather forecast. When all they wanted to know was whether they were gonna get pissed on or not. - Just look at this. See what Ellie has dug up. Accident rates at AirZone facilities. Bodies of the victims withheld from their families. Vital research data, contamination, national security. And what about Al Dunbar, body found out in the open, 25 miles from his home. Forgot his mask, hmm? Death caused by airborne toxins exacerbated by bronchitis. At the low levels in that toxic depression the other night he would have had to have had advanced pleurisy and severe asthma to have passed out, never mind died. Anyway, he didn't seem to have as much as a cold to me. - What do you mean? I didn't think you even knew Al Dunbar. - I don't. But Sam, there is something going on. I don't believe that you're turning a blind eye. You used to know Al, didn't you? - I want a cast-iron guarantee from you that there'll be no more of this crap, Arnie. - Arnie, what... - If this has anything to do with you, Ellie... - Arnie? Arnie, what happened? - I told the truth. - Yes, I know, I saw your forecast. - And I read your file. - But you can't just-- - Just what, tell anyone? You mean I have to pretend there isn't some kind of conspiracy going on, is that it? Well maybe you're part of it. - Oh, now. Look Arnie, just get a grip. You're pushing yourself over the edge here. - No, something is pushing me. And I have to find out what it is or... - Look, I've got to get back. - Saw the forecast. Dynamite. Surprised you didn't give me a mention. (suspenseful music) (door knocking) - Did I ever tell you you're good at your job? - I know I'm good at my job. - That must be why I never told you. - Is there a problem? - With this, no. Good stuff. Please make sure you get it verified before you blurt it out during our AirZone forum coverage next week, but no no, it's very good, very-- - Very Al Dunbar? - Only if you don't check your facts. Only if you've got a gut feeling and nothing else, then it's very Al Dunbar. - You did a lot of work with Al. How come you two fell out? - Sorry, is there a camera here? - Sorry. - Anyway, we're not here to discuss Al Dunbar. - Arnie. - You're telling me that AirZone killed Al Dunbar? - Oh don't try and be skeptical. You saw them take the tapes away, you know how they behave. - Yeah, but having a dubious court order to remove someone else's property is hardly the same thing as murder. - Look, let's not waste time. I knew the first time I saw you in that weather program. Hardly a mystical experience by the way. - I was trying to help. - Right, all right, you want to nail your colors to the mast but don't try and dodge what's happening to you, to us. - Your friend has just died in what are admittedly suspicious circumstances. I can understand that this might well push you over the edge. - Yes, but what's pushing you? - I don't think this conversation is getting us anywhere. - 9:29 pm, that's when it first happened. 9:29 pm. - You're barking mad. - Oh no, please please, not that, no no, not the last refuge of the rational man, you're barking mad. Yes, well I thought they're all potty too, the more extreme elements of Global Concern. But I tolerated them. But you see it all makes sense. Nature will find a way, you see, nature will survive. Faced with the human race's sophisticated attack, it all stands to reason that Earth will have a trump card up its sleeve. People with a mission. People connected. People who will stand up and fight mankind on his own terms. Fight to save the Earth. Crap, claptrap, bollocks is it, old chap? 9:29 pm, 9:29 pm. 9:29 pm. - All right, all right, 9:29 pm, I collapsed. - Yes, and I crashed my car. But why? - I saw Al Dunbar die! (electronic beeping) - Look, I know Arnie's been a little close to the edge since his divorce. But he's stayed on top form in front of the weather map. Fine. But to be quite honest Ellie, I wasn't all that surprised when he collapsed the other night. But now this political posturing during the weather forecast and I don't think this is helping. - Well I don't think AirZone is helping. They're pretty suspect Sam, and you know it. - No, I don't know it. I've heard the rumors. I know what Al Dunbar has to say on the subject. - That AirZone and the government are joined at the hip. - So any story we put out has to be watertight. Anyway, this is irrelevant. I've asked Arnie for a guarantee of no repeat performances. If I don't get that guarantee he doesn't go back on air. - And you want me to talk to him? - Yes, please. - You've been leant on, Sam. All part of the job, being at the sharp end? - Well... - Why don't we use my car? - We'll use mine. - Where are we going? Just tell me for heaven's sake. - Stanwick. - Yes, I can see him too. - But he can't be dead. - Oh no, he's dead. - [Arnie] Doesn't even look ill to me. - [Antony] He's an afterimage. - You have to work together, Antony. Help doesn't always come from expected places. Remember how you thought I wasn't on your side? Just out to make a name for myself. - Al, I'm sorry, I heard the alarms, I ran out on you. But there was nothing-- - Feeling guilty won't achieve anything. We have to work together. - We have to work together. I'm here to help now. I may not be ideal, but... - I'm sorry, we didn't see you there. - We were just daydreaming. - Not a bit of it. Quite a useful conversation, I imagine. - Conversation? - With the other fella. Excuse me. - I think you'll find the Secretary of State is very keen on the idea. And this of course will help to reestablish your company's credibility. - Yes, of course. (door knocking) Come in. - So we're going for a drive? - Smile, some sneaky bastard might be watching. I think my phone's been tapped. My house is being watched. Thus, coded messages from Rachel. - [Arnie] So Rachel's your mole. The one who got Al into this Transhaw place. So where is she now? - Behind you. Don't look. Someone might be watching. She's in danger. Rachel. - Antony. They killed Al. - We know. - What's the matter, Rachel? What's the problem? - They saw us meet. They knew. (coughing) (suspenseful music) - Are we being followed? - I'm sorry. - Now listen Rachel, I'm a friend. There may not be much time. What are they doing with the dead bodies, the AirZone accident victims? - The AirZone Solution. I don't know the details. Something to do with testing. - Bastards. - We could have taken her to a doctor, medical information, hard facts. - Facts leading to what? - I don't know, she said something about tests. - I knew I shouldn't have brought you. - What the hell's it got to do with me? - You were the one I made a berk of yourself in front of millions of people. AirZone were bound to be watching. - It's you they're watching. Al said we should-- - Oh you didn't even know him! - I might be able to help. At least I know I'm not going mad. - And you are? - About to be shouted at. - Not a smart move. - Hm? - Well I could have got the ax between your shoulder blades and you wouldn't have seen me coming. - I'm sorry. - Well I hope you are, Arnie. Because I am doing my best to understand what is going on here. - Me too, Ellie. Me too. - Sam's been leant on. - What about? - I don't know, AirZone, the government. - Does that mean I'm unemployed? - Not necessarily. Sam wants to make you an offer you can't refuse. Just see him tomorrow morning. - So how was your day? - Oh just, pre-AirZone forum stuff. Just trying to work on the interview with Sir Richard Allenby. - I didn't know you were talking to him. - Well he is Secretary of State for the Environment. And I've only been trailing this three days. - [Arnie] So I'm no use to you, am I? - I just need to meet him. It would be an ideal opportunity. - Sorry, who are we talking about? - Allenby. - I'll see what I can do. But I'm not treading on her professional toes. - Transhaw report Rachel settled down nicely. - Good, I want her monitored 24 hours a day. - Already seen to. What about Stanwick and Davis? - What about them? - Wasn't it rather unwise to leave them behind? If we'd taken Rachel when she was alone-- - If you remember, you couldn't find her when she was alone. Besides, it doesn't matter how much they know or think they know. They've no proof. - No way, Arnie. - It'd only be for a few minutes. - Can my mother appear in your weather forecast? - That's not the same thing at all. Antony Stanwick-- - Is a Grade A weirdo. - I don't want him to take part in the interview. Just a few words-- - No Arnie, piss off. - Please, Ellie. - I can't believe you're even asking me this. - Can't I be selfish? - Look, read my lips. No way, Jose. (suspenseful music) - I understand that impatience, but it doesn't make it right to jump the gun you know, because when all the technological options become clear, then the government, and some of them are very exciting, these options, then the government will be in a position to shine a light, to show the way forward. - Sounds like a slogan. - Yes, well, good slogans get across the message, and the message in this case is that AirZone could very well be good news for all of us. And our way of life. - Thank you, Sir Richard. - You're welcome. - We'll cut it there, Dick. I think that went very well. - Well I hope so, I wanted to make it reasonably relaxed because I think people are getting very... - Sir Richard, I wonder. Do you recognize this young lady? - I'm sorry, Sir Richard. - Ms. Brown. - I must apologize, this has nothing to do with me. Arnie, please. - Sorry, shall I repeat the question? - I'm sorry, I really must be going, I can't answer any more questions. - Of course not, Sir Richard. - Perhaps you could find out how she is, she works at the Transhaw Clinic. - Well in that case-- - AirZone's secret research institute. I believe that she is in terrible trouble. I noticed when you looked at this photograph you looked rather guilty. Why should that be? Rachel. - I believe there was a rather unfortunate accident involving the new generation of toxic incinerator. The girl died. - When? - I believe it was the beginning of the week. Very tragic. - How strange. I only saw her yesterday. - Then you were mistaken. Sir Richard, please? - I'm very sorry-- - Thank you, Ms. Brown. - You're out of control, Arnie. That was totally unacceptable. - Ellie, Ellie, I know it must look that way. But we both saw her yesterday. - This Rachel? - And she was in a terror. AirZone have done something to her. - This dead Rachel? - We saw her yesterday. - Was Al there by any chance? - No no, Ellie. - Can I ask you a question, Ellie? - Don't call me Ellie. - What kind of journalist are you? There's obviously something going on that Allenby knows nothing about. And I bet doesn't want to know anything about. - As long as AirZone deliver the goods. - Whatever they may be. - OK. Something's going on. But what? - Allenby was put on the spot without any warning. And all because those apes did a smash-and-grab in broad daylight and under the noses of two known opponents of AirZone. Archer? Well she believes that the weatherman won't be able to resist the temptation to humiliate himself at the forum. And that Stanwick has no credibility anyway. Spent forces. Yeah. But it's all a question of marketing and public perception. It isn't the idea. It's the image. And right now the image is starting to look rather tarnished. Pity. I'll be in touch. - [Sam] Standby forum. Coming to you live in five. Cut. - AirZone have managed to put together a pretty impressive lineup of guest speakers and attendees. Having dispelled any legitimate doubts about previous performance, they are now able to go to the business community and the healthcare agents with the full backing of the government. Naturally the Secretary of State for the Environment is here today but most people feel that the highlight of the event will be what has become known as the keynote speech, to be given by the chief executive of AirZone, Robin Archer. - Cut to camera three. Run VTA. - Ah, what the hell's he doing here? - Just a minute, Stanwick. Where's he going? - All I know is we're leaving in about... Arnie. - What? Never mind that. - Look, I've got to be on live TV in two minutes. Why don't you tell me whatever it is you want. - You can say goodbye to fame and fortune for now. (dramatic music) - This is an historic occasion. The government has put its trust in AirZone and charged us to carry out a duty to the people of this country. I am honored. It is a trust we shall not betray and a duty in which we shall not fail. - Rachel. - We all enjoy unparalleled luxuries. But no one can pretend that wearing an atmosphere mask half our lives is a price worth paying. Radical solutions are required to improve our lives in a rapidly changing environment. But we are not going to turn the world upside down as some pressure groups would have us do. We're not going to cause economic collapse so that the government has to wade in with budget-breaking handouts and market controls. That would be turning back the clock to some bygone age with outdated lifestyles and attitudes. But that's what the environmentalists want. As far as they're concerned industry could grind to a halt tomorrow. Their world is idyllic, apparently. (audience laughing) No cars, no nuclear power, no washing machines. Mankind cannot uninvent its past achievements. We cannot regress. Progress is the way forward. Progress. - [MacNamara] It's up to you now. (Rachel groaning) - We are tackling the problem before us with two major initiatives. Yes, we continue with our clean air operation. Our toxic incinerators are recognized the world over as the best in state-of-the-art anti-pollution hardware. Not only that, their performance is monitored on an ongoing basis. But we cannot force the pace beyond the country's economic needs. So yes. Our second and most vital initiative is a full program of consultation with the healthcare agencies. We must protect the population while the process of pollution management is underway. And it is our intention for the vital pollution filter implant trials to be undertaken by the healthcare agencies represented here today. Together we can tackle the greatest challenge in mankind's history. Together we will cross new frontiers of technology and human experience. Together we can breathe new life into our future. - Arnie? - I have to do this, I can't just. You understand? (dramatic music) I didn't want to do this. But I have to. In the hope that, that... That someone, somewhere is listening. - Cut to camera three. And four. - They're telling us to pull transmission. Sam? - Come back to three. Stay with it, Arnie. - They're not cleaning up the air. They're doing something else. I don't know what it is, but I do know that it's bad, and that it's killing people. Here's someone who knows. And she is going to tell you. Or I am going to kill her. Tell them. Tell me. - [Antony] I can do better than that. Here's your proof. Rachel Lonsdale, officially certified dead in an AirZone toxic incinerator accident. Actually a living subject for experimentation in AirZone's top-secret medical establishment, the Transhaw Clinic. - This is her way forward. A toxic breather. No need to clean the air. - This is a mistake. You shouldn't have seen this. (Rachel coughing) She is a prototype. The next stage of the research, don't you see? (audience murmuring) - No! We've made our world. You want it this way don't you, then we must change to suit it. There's no other way. Not without destroying everything you stand for. You can't have it both ways. This is the way forward! - MI5 pulls the plug? - Marketing and public perception. It's not the idea, it's the image. Neat idea, bad image. - Neat idea? Is that it? - It's over, Arnie. - Very impressive. I knew you could do it. - Just a minute. - Lucky they shot themselves in the foot. Al would have approved. (gentle music)
