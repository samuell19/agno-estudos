-I can see you, Daddy. I still can. -OK. Daddy surrenders. Let me put it this way. I think in Vietnam the green's a different color. OK. Come on. Let's get back. -What are you two doing? The car's sitting here half packed. I just want to get to this vacation, Donegin. -Just showing Stevie how we used to camouflage ourselves in the Green Berets, that's all. -Invisible, Ma. -You're not taking that horrible uniform to Kerry are you? Darling, don't be silly. It was hanging in the basement when we went to get the fishing rods, and he asked. You can't blame me for that. -Marry an American, have spoiled brats, believe you me. -Oh, really? Marry an Irish lass and you get nagged at all the time. Give me those, David. Look, Ma. -Am I on toe? -You can't be on toe without toe shoes. Now, Melody, put the tutu back in the bag. I said you could take it. Honestly, it's going to be two in the afternoon before we drive out the driveway. -There you go nagging again. We'll be in Kerry before dark. -And there are two cases in the kitchen. -Look who's carrying them. Martha. -Give me those, Martha. Give this one to Stevie. It's not too heavy for you, is it? -No, it's not heavy. Martha, take that. -OK. Thanks. -OK. In you get. -Nobody can see you at all? -Nope. Just like we're invisible. -I want to see that invisible. -Well, Come here. Stevie, Daddy doesn't do that anymore. You see, war's mean and horrible and nasty and Mommy was probably right. I shouldn't have shown it to you. That thing in Vietnam was stupid and a big mistake. So you forget about it, OK? OK. -Telephone, Mr. Donegin. Telephone is ringing. -Hello, Mr. Donegin. The main office in Connecticut just rang. Well, I know you're going on holiday. But I though it would be better to tell you before you went. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look. I'll take it with me on the holiday and I'll try and go through it. But I don't guarantee anything, OK? What? Oh, we will, believe you me. Thanks a lot. See you in a couple of weeks. I'll get the groceries, honey. Bring Melody. -You feel asleep in the car, darling. -You sure did. -Hey. Big buddy. Tomorrow morning I'll make your breakfast. I'll get a striped bass about, oh, that big. -Daddy, I'm going to be a ballerina. -I know. Shhh, go to sleep, Melody. -Good grief, Melody. Go to sleep. -Shh, you, too. -Are you happy, Steven? Mm? -Are you happy? -Am I happy? I got a job I like. I got a lovely family. I got a lovely home. Two lovely homes. Am I happy? -I wonder if you're satisfied here in Ireland. What are you talking about? -Well, sometimes I'm afraid you miss the competition in America. -Miss that jungle? Are you kidding? I;m so glad to be out of that executive rat race. Darling, I've fought enough battles in my time. Let somebody else do the fighting from now on. -I love you. Do you love me? Mrs. Donegin, you're the nicest person I ever met. You're the dearest face on this earth. And I'm the luckiest man alive. So shut up. PILOT: Fenway Chemicals requesting ground control for permission to take off for New York via Shannon Island. -Oh, look at that surf. Hey, Stevie. Forgot the gunny sacks. -What? -The gunny sacks to put the fishies in, silly. Ask Mommy. They're in the cottage. -OK. I'll get them. -OK. That's a boy. Now, remember young people of Lochland of course. So he's over here now at the head of the force. I met him one day I was passing the Strand. But he stopped the whole thing with a wave of his hand. [EXPLOSION] [SCREAM -(SCREAMING) Oh, my god. Oh, my god. -(SCREAMING) Oh, my god. Ahh. -There's nothing left in the cottage but I found a gentleman's briefcase in the bedroom. Should I give it in? -No, not now, not at this time. I want to get our friend here back to Dublin. Look, put it in the boot of his own car and follow on behind us. -It's Mr. Tooms. Tell him I got his wire. Ellis, it's Tooms. Request where? Island? Kerry? The plan must have been 10 minutes early. Otherwise, I can assure you, it had to go down over open water. I did not make a mistake. I never make mistakes, you know that. . Yes Yes, Grossman is with me. To Dublin? Yes, sir. Yes. We leave right away. [BAND PLAYING] -Tom. -I know it's only routine, Tom. But it's important. See, there are six foreign nationals involved. -Yes, but this is a uniform branch job. I thought it was an accident. What do you want to pull me off the clam squad for? -Well, I thought you were of an age when you might be able to bring a sense of compassion to those involved. I don't want to send a young rookie down there. Stamping all over everybody's feelings. -Oh, well. If you think you can trust me with it, I suppose-- But tell us what happened? -Look. About two days ago an executive plane belonging to an American corporation called uh Fenway Chemicals took off from Rome bound for New York. It was due to refuel here. At Shannon. It came down here. In Kerry. On course for Shannon, just across the coast. -And what was the reason for the crash? -No one seems to know. Eyewitnesses say it appeared to blow up in midair. -Where's the wreckage? But everything's laid out for you in a hangar in Kerry. I want you to go down there. Take a few notes. And make a report. -It's for the record. Do you mind if I bring Bob Haggerty along with me? -What for? Do you want the per diem? Ah, no, no, no. I'll take care of that. Out of me next pay envelope. -Buck Haggerty is in awe of everybody, Tom. Not just you. -I know that. But he's also a demolitions expert. Or do you not want me to have any autonomy in this authority that you delegated to me? -Oh, yes. English. -Is he? -Wouldn't you know by the cut of his clothes, for heaven's sake. -He looks nervous. -Does he now? -My name's Brewster. James Brewster. -Uh, huh. -My grandmother was Irish. -Ah, yes. Wasn't everybody's? I'm Detective Inspector Maloney. This is Mr. Haggerty, of the Dublin Police. -I'm Fenway Chemicals English lawyer. This was our plane, I'm afraid. Of course, you understand, Inspector, we must protect our interests in terms of possible litigation. -Will I carry out my job then, Tom? -Yes you just do that. Do you know who was on board? -Robert Leonard, the pilot. Professor Ferengetti. And Mr. Romano, his assistant. They were both Italians. -Ah, professors. Is that so? Yes. Chemistry. Theoretical research. That sort of thing. We considered him an absolute genius. Well of course, he's a great loss, not only to the company. -I'm quite sure. And the six parties? -That poor family. Do you happen to know where Mr. Donegin is just now? He's gone home to his place in Dublin. That's somewhere just outside Dublin. Isn't it? -You left London yesterday. -Yes. -Ah, no, no. You mean three days ago, just after the crash, because you were in Rome, weren't you? The stickers on your bag there. -Yes, you're quite right. Professor Ferengetti left from Rome. -And you went to check with his hotel. What were you looking for? -Just being thorough, Inspector. -Ah, yes. Just being thorough. -You found something? Doesn't make any sense. It's a timing device. What's left of it. No question. Are you sure there's nothing here that I should know about? We're just combing through the wreckage. Where will you be staying? -Shelbourne in Dublin. Do you happen to know if there was a found here? -Excuse me, sir. I found Mr. Donegin's briefcase and was instructed to put it in the boot of his car. -No other briefcase? -No, sir. -That's too bad. The professor was carrying papers. They aren't irreplaceable. They though they might have survived the crash. Tell me, Inspector, have you ever solved a case like this before. I don't mean to be rude, but have you ever worked on a case like this? [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] -I'm very sorry for your trouble, Mr. Donegin. -Thank you. I'm Detective Inspector Tom Maloney, Dublin Police. -What have the police got to do with this? -It's this. Look I'm really sorry. I'm really sad that it has to be me. And that it has to be this way. Do you know what this is? -I've seen a few of them. We established the device was in the wing root. -You're telling me this wasn't act of, an accident? Wasn't an act of God? -No, I'm afraid it was definitely an act of man, Mr. Donegin. You see, I know what happened and I know how it happened. But I don't know who and I don't know why. And whatever the answers to these two questions is, the bomb was planted in Rome. But the answers to the questions are outside our-- That's my territory, Mr. Donegin. Come on, let me take you home, Mr. Donegin. --My darlings. I've got work to do. Please will you listen? believe me, there was no point in you trying to get here for it. That's the reason I didn't call you. I'm sorry you had to hear it like that. Look, it's a long way from Corsica to Dublin. I'll come and see you. Soon as I can. Soon as I get free and then we'll talk. Hey. Hey. Hey. Cut it out, will you? Yeah, I love you, too. Yeah. Yeah, I've got things to do. -There's an Englishman. From London. A lawyer. -Who? He says his name is Brewster. If you wouldn't mind, could you spare him a few minutes? -Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. -Fenway wants you to know that it's not unfeeling about this. But something, something could be worked out, something reasonable. Of course, it could never, ever make up for you, your terrible loss, just something to help out. And whoever was responsible, obviously had no connection with Fenway. -Wait a minute. Who was, the way you put it, responsible? -Who knows that? I heard it was a bomb. Well it was, wasn't it? Fenway, wouldn't, would never blow up their own plane. -Well, somebody was responsible, weren't they? -Look, I understand a briefcase was found on the scene. A briefcase. -Was the briefcase the reason for the bomb? -Oh, no, no, no. It was nothing as important as that. It was just something we'd like to get back if we could. To save a little time. Look, I haven't the foggiest idea why anybody would want to do this to Fenway. Maybe some demented ex-employee. The world is full of sick people. Could you look in the boot? I mean in your trunk. What? There's no point. The only case found was mine. OK? I'll be at the Shelbourne. I'll be there a few days. -Hey. Sir. Excuse me. Hold it a minute. Excuse me. Mr. uh, -Brewster. -Brewster. Yeah, I did have a thought. They put together some things for me in a box in Kerry and I've got to go through them. And if I find anything I'll get in touch with you. Where were you staying again? -At the Shelbourne. I'll be there a few days. -Yeah. I'll be waiting to see if the police find anything? Perhaps we can have a drink together? And perhaps you wouldn't mind signing a little paper. just a little agreement absolving Fenway of something, just for the record. along those lines. -Well, sure. We'll talk about it. I'm a little out of it right now. -I'd feel the same way if I was you. -Listen, do you know your way back to Dublin? -I have to turn right and go back the way I came. -I got a better way. Turn left. Then you come to this gas station, uh, petrol station. And then the first light, second light, turn left again, take you straight into town. OK? -Thanks. I'll try that. -Hey, Frank. Steve Donegin. Hey, listen. Off the record. You know, a couple weeks ago you wanted to know about somebody's insurance policy? And I steered you in the right direction? Well, I want to know the owner of a, car registration number, O N I six one three. It's gotta be a phony? It couldn't be license plate like that? Look at the number on the engine block? I haven't got the car. OK. I'll fine another way. Yeah, thanks Frank. Thanks, buddy. -It was nice of you to come. What can I do for you? First what will you have? -Nothing right now, thanks. Listen, I've been giving a lot of thought to this business of signing that document. -Uh, huh. Absolving Fenway from any litigation from me. -Very helpful of you. Though, we've now got evidence that there was no fault of our company here. -Exactly. OK. Mr. Brewster, you'll get your signature here, nevertheless. Whoever planted that bomb had a motive of either killing the professor or destroying something else that was in that plane. Now what do you suppose that something else could have been? -If I tell you everything that I know, would you sign my indemnification? -Here and now. Well, Professor Ferengetti was employed by us as a research chemist and he was carrying a briefcase containing company papers, technical materials, I don't know exactly what. On the night before he left Rome, he lodged in the hotel safe a duplicate briefcase, containing, apparently, duplicate papers. And when I arrived in Rome, obviously armed with a power of attorney, they handed me the briefcase and apparently it had been opened by force. Although the contents were intact, we must presume they were photographed. Now when I had them examined by a resident research chemist, they turned out to be useless. -So whoever did it, didn't get what they came for. -That's the supposition, Mr. Donegin. I'm a solicitor. I only deal in facts. -Yeah, OK. That's the why. Who's the who? -Ah, Mr. Brewster. At last. I have been searching all over Dublin for you. There's a very informative doorman outside. He said you might be in here. May I sit down? I've come from London, actually to talk to you about Fenway Chemicals. -We're in the middle of a meeting, Miss Leighton. -Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I won't be more than a few minutes. It's about that plane that blew up with Professor on board. -I'm afraid there's absolutely nothing that I could or wish to talk to you about. -Well, Mr. Brewster, you know someone had to be behind that crash. It's been in the papers. The plane was bombed. What kind of industrial rivals do you have with motive enough to do that. -I haven't the faintest idea. Well, tell me, is it true the plane was carrying the Ferengetti formula? -I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. As far as I know there's nothing to it. It could have been terrorists or a plot of some sort. Well, why would terrorists want to blow up a professor of pharmacology? -I don't know. -Well, it is true that Intent had been making offers recently to the professor? -We have many rivals in the world of industrial pharmacology but I, for one, am not prepared to talk about it to you, so if you'll forgive me, I have nothing more to say. -OK, Mr. Brewster, OK. I won't trouble you any more. -That woman is such a bore. -Who is she? -Candia Leighton. Part-time financial journalist. Would be investigative reporter. Which means she has the answers before she asks the questions. -Excuse me a minute. Ms. Leighton. Excuse me. My name is Steve Donegin. It was my family who were killed in the plane crash. -Oh, Lord. Oh, I'm so sorry. I noticed you staring at me. -I'm sorry about that too. It's just incredible. The way you resemble my wife. -I don't know what to say. -Yeah, yeah, anyway. Something you said in there interested me. What's Intent? -Intent. International Enterprise Corporation. It's a huge conglomerate of enormous power. You've never heard of it? -No. Why did you mention them in particular? Oh, there's been a rumor in financial circles, recently, Professor Ferengetti had made some sort of a major breakthrough in the development of a really new revolutionary antibiotic. And Calan Chemicals, which is owned by Intent is also working on the same project. -This guy Ferengetti cracked the formula first? -It's possible. It is possible. -Uh, huh. Listen, thanks you very much. And excuse me again. Look, if necessary, can I get in touch with you? -Well, I'll only be here a few days. I'm staying at Fitzpatrick's if you want. Bye. -OK. Thank you. Mr. Brewster. I'm going to level with you. I didn't lie to you yesterday. But I reexamined my briefcase and it's not mine. It could be Fenway's. You, you have it? -Yeah. Now, listen. I, I can't take it to the house right now. I've got a ton of things to do. And I won't be home until around dawn. But if you come around breakfast time, I'll, uh, I'll give it to you. See you around. Hey, buddy. -Uh, Mr. Donegin. The serve and protect. Let me walk you over to Dublin cabs. I'll give you a lift in my car anywhere you want to go. Never mind about the cab. -No, thanks. I'm all right. Mr. Donegin. I believe you're in Kerry for the fishing. Is that right? -Yeah. Ah, yes, that's a great sport, fishing. My favorite sport, you might say, fishing. -Why don't you say what you want to say. -Mr. Brewster was interested in the briefcase. I saw the pair of you in the bar together there. -Yeah. -Could I see it sometime? -It's all burnt up. -Is that so? That's a pity. Why did you ring the central car registration? Huh? -So Frank Pierson put me into the cops, huh? -He did, of course. -All right. When Brewster left my house, there was a car following him. I'm positive. -Good. Good. So I understand. O N I 6 1 3 A Ford. I'm having it looked for. Maybe, maybe I shouldn't have done that. -You do as you like. You wouldn't want to be doing my job for me by any chance, would you? -No you don't need any help. Because I was thinking, you see, that you might be thinking of revenge. So just uh, watch yourself. Like a good man. -Yes, sir. -And keep in touch with me. -Yes, sir. -Couldn't we turn on the light? -Don't be stupid. -A light would draw the neighbors. -I, I,I stay downstairs? -Fine. I'll take upstairs. [CLINKING] [GLASS BREAKING] [CRASHING NOISE] -What happened? -Look, somebody left something on the floor. -Stupid. Did you find anything? -No. It'll be light soon. Come on. Move. [POLICE SIREN] -I'm sorry, Mr. Donegin. But you were asleep when I came in. But I though you'd want me to send for the police. -You did the right thing. Thank you. -Well, first a funeral, and now burglars. -Yes, pretty clumsy ones. -Yeah. -Lot of breakage. Anything missing? -I don't know yet. Must be a heavy sleeper. -No, not usually. But I took a pill. -Ah, did you? -Well, glad to see you alive and well. All right, boys. We can leave Mr. Donegin to himself. -Morning. -What's happened here? -Oh, morning. I'm OK, but it seems we have kind of messy burglars. -Your phone was constantly engaged so I took the liberty of driving over here. -I found this upstairs, sir. -Oh, yes. -May I see it please? -Uh, yes, we better let Mr. Brewster see it. It may be what he's looking for. I'm not to do a problem o k It's empty. -That's the way it was handed to me after the crash. -Are you quite certain that you didn't open it? -You just broke the locks yourself. -That's it. That's the end of the Ferengetti formula. May I have the briefcase? -Well, strictly speaking I should keep it. But if Mr. Donegin doesn't mind, yeah, sure, yes, take it with you to New York. Maybe it can prove useful. -I'm sorry. Would you like a drink for your trip? -Oh, no thanks. I want to catch that 5 o'clock plane to London, so will you excuse me? Excuse me. My dear, she dialed the number. All you've got to do is say who I am. OK. Thank you. -Yes? Well, our policy is not to reveal information about-- Yes, well, my superior said it was all right if Mr. Donegin positively identified himself. Thank you very much. The car was rented by a Mr. Tooms. -Tooms. -T, double O, M, S. Jasper Tooms. -It was charged to a credit card company, wasn't it? -Eurotrav. It's billed to a corporate account. Intent. International Enterprises Corporation. -Does it say where their main office is? Yes. It uh, it's London. 22 Lexus Square. Got it. Listen, thank you so much. You've been very kind. -What are you stopping for? -Press on, Mr. Besman. -There's a Mr. Medwin inside your office, Mr. Donegin. -Medwin? OK. -Hey, hey. Hey. Who are you? Pete Medwin. New York office. How you doing, Steve? Oh, how are you? Look, everyone's real sick about this in Connecticut. New York, too. -Yeah. Thanks. Well, what are you doing here? -The company is your friend. They want you to take off. You know, a healing period. They want you to come in as you like, go as you like. Won't you please? What if I please put you back on plane to New York. Wrong. You've got it wrong. Did you know the company has insurance on you and your family? I've go here a check in the round figure of, You ready? $150,000.00. Yeah. -150,000? -Cashier's check. Instant good. -That employee's policy is for a hundred thou. What's the extra fifty grant for? -The company cares. You know what they said to me? Tell him to go around the world. And that just didn't come from nobody. It came right down from the tippy top. -What's the tippy top, Connecticut? -Higher. -Forget it. -Higher. -We're the biggest insurance company in the world. -There's higher. What do you care? -You mean we've been swallowed by a bigger fish? -Yeah. That's who sanctioned the fifty grand bonus, on account of the tragedy. -Who is it? Who owns it? Do you know? -Yeah, I know. I'm not supposed to, but I know. Bedroom confident. My lips are sealed. -Well, unseal them. -Intent. International Enterprises Corporation. That's who owns us. Ever heard of them? -How did you know I was here? -I like to keep myself informed. You know? By the way, uh, Mr. Brewster's dead. -Oh. -Yeah. -How? Well, they found him at the foot of a cliff. Head is messed up. -So, they got him. -They, who are they? By the way. -I don't know. Yet. You know, I, I,I, sort of envy you because you, you can get away from here and whenever the fancy takes you. I'm just an old cop. I have to stay inside my own jurisdiction. But just let give you a tip. As one fisherman to another. When you're going after the big jack pike fish, just don't draw him out of his own deep waters onto your side of the bank. Where you live. -Hm. -Take care of yourself, won't you. -Mr. Donegin? -Hi. -Hello again. -My apologies for not calling ahead of time. My name's Steve. -Steve. Can we sit down and talk? -Sure. -Yesterday when we met at the Shelbourne. I went back into Brewster. And he had me half convinced that you were uh, some kind of a kook. Well, he's dead. -Mr. Brewster? -Brewster's dead. -Oh, good Lord. They'll stop at nothing. -That's the reason I'm here. Who is they? I mean, what's Entent? I mean, Intent. Who's behind it? -Gray Harrison Hunt. -Never heard of him. -No, no, few people have. But he does own and control that corporation. And Intent owns and controls about 400 subsidiaries scattered throughout 45 countries. He is very, very powerful. And I think he's completely ruthless. -You sound like you're talking from personal experience. -Yes, well you see, I wrote a book about Intent. I spent about three years on it. I think I must know more about that corporation than just about anybody does. -My lord, I wish I'd read the book. -It was never published. Oh, I tried. It just seemed as if every publisher in the Western world backed off. As soon as they considered publishing it. -Backed off? Financial pressure? -Hm. In a way. Threats of litigation. I mean it's expensive. Publishers do have to make money. -Listen, would you happen to have the original manuscript? -I do. Could I read it? I'll read it right here in the hotel. -Yeah, sure. Sure, it's in my room. Come on up. I'll give it to you. -Thank you. Good lord, Are you still reading? It's morning. -Hm, hm. -I know you don't believe it. Nobody does. -I want to tell you something. I believe it. He owns Eurotran, the credit card company. -He owns your own insurance company. -I found out that yesterday. Everything that has-- Everything he touches turns to gold. How does he do it? -He steals. -Huh? -Industrial espionage. And then when he's destroyed something, it folds, and he swallows it up. Do you want to hear my theory? You see, today, the way you take over the world is through religion, or the media. You can own newspapers, TV stations, radio stations, motion picture studios, you can just about control the US government that way. -Ain't a bad theory. You're a good looking lady. With a good sounding theory. Well now comes my theory. The only way to whip a pyramid is to cut the top off. Then it's got no point. -That's true. But you have to find the top. -Mm. -Hey. -What? -You know what? Why don't you go to sleep? Just go to sleep. Come on. -Here? -Yes. Right here. Just put your head down. And put your feet up. -You serious? -Uh, huh. Absolutely. Then, after you've slept, we'll take this up again and I'll buy you breakfast. -I think I really can. God, I'm tired. We've got a deal about breakfast. -Yeah. You're a very decent man, Steve, you know that? Just go to sleep. And I'll stand guard. -All right. Let's get down to it. Where is this fellow? Gray Harrison Hunt. -Why do you think I'm in Ireland? He's got a thing for horses. -Race horses? He owns them? -Hm, hm. He owns Rainbow. -I know Rainbow. He's a classic horse, isn't he? -Hm, hm. -Where is he tonight? -Rainbow, tonight is in a stall in Kildare. And tomorrow, he's going to run in the Irish Steeplechase Darby. He may win it too, I don't think he'd miss that. -Kildare. Right under me very nose. RACE ANNOUNCER: And here they come past the stands. [TRACK ANNOUNCER CALLING THE RACE OF THE IRISH STEEPLECHASE] -Right up there. -Got him. [TRACK ANNOUNCER ] RACE ANNOUNCER: Rainbow is the winner. He's won for Gray Harrison Hunt. [APPLAUSE] -Count. -Who the blazes are you? My name's Steve Donegin. You killed my wife and two children when your plane dropped on my house. -Oh. Now I know who you are. But I had nothing to do with it. -No? No, hear me. I can prove it to you. What good would it do to your wife and kids to take revenge on an innocent man, Steve Donegin. And you are Miss Candia Leighton. Why, if I'm such a monster would I allow her to walk about and say the things she does about me? Oh, I'll admit that somebody was responsible for putting the bomb on that plane and for the death of Mr. Brewster Isn't that right? Brewster? Well, damn it, I have to keep tabs on this thing. I'm the obvious suspect. For all I know, I'm being framed. And that's the whole point of it. I'm just as hard to find as you are. Now, look. I can take you to where I can prove, show you proof that I'm as innocent of all of this as you are. Oh, for heaven's sake, man I know what you've been through. What you want is vengeance. Not just random violence. What was meted out to your wife and kids. -All right. I'll give you a chance. Show me. No, Steve, no. It's a trick. No trick. Just a chance to prove that I'm completely innocent. -is that your Helicopter outside? -Yes. -All right. The three of us walk out. Get aboard and take off. If there's any interference, you'll be the first to get it. Let's go. Let's go. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] You're going to show me proof. We didn't come here to listen to the story of your life. -I'm sorry. Uh, you have, I believe, a notion that uh, I employ Michael Tooms, is that right? -Tooms. Now we're getting somewhere. His credit cards was charged to Intent. -Hmm. Is Tooms out there? Would you send him in, please? Oh, and, um, tell him to bring in that book of checks, will you? I'm down in your books. I'm the villain. Well if, like you, I'd lost my entire family, and had my hard work consistently rejected, I'd be as liable as you to want to kill the supposed culprit. More liable. Ah, Tooms. Mr. Donegin, this is my Mr. Tooms. He's one of my ablest accountants. -It's not him. It's not the same one. -A different man? Tooms, would you pull out your wallet and show it to Mr. Donegin. You have in it do you, your driving license, some other form of identification. Not, of course, your Eurotrav card. And tell Mr. Donegin, would you what happened to that? -It was stolen from me in Paris a month ago. In a tourist trap. -A uh Paris police report's to that effect. There's a date on it. -What about Professor Ferengetti and the formula. -My dear lady. Entire Chemical is one of my own. It's a fierce competitor. But we are far too successful to resort to blowing up the entire academic community. You knew -About it? -Are you saying you didn't want it? -The formula? I owned it. Tooms, would you open that book of checks at the pertinent page. What does that tell you, Mr. Donegin? -Made out Ferengetti for two million dollars. And the date? And the dates above and below it for that matter. -The day after the crash. -Exactly. Thank you, Tooms. -Why wasn't that check given to him beforehand? -Having reached New York, it was arranged that a wire photocopy of a check be shown to him. I think he wanted to give Fenway one last chance to better their offer. Of course, they couldn't. -You're saying he was being disloyal to Fenway? -Well, I'm afraid so. It isn't cricket perhaps, but it isn't criminal. Its business. Anyway they were underpaying him. If you want a man's loyalty, you ought to deal generously with him. -How were you going to receive the formula? -Um, in New York, by an agent. Here simultaneously. The check was to be given to designate of the professor's. Nobody trusting nobody. -Wait, wait, a moment. Hold it. How do we know you didn't know drum all this up since we left the racetrack? -Including a Paris police report? You must think I'm the Wizard of Oz. Oh, I admit, somebody was responsible for blowing up that plane. But I'm a loser as well. Must be clear to you by now that it was not in my best interests do so. You run the American insurance company, Dublin branch. Is the reason for that you keep pushing the ball uphill? So why would you want to sneer at a man whose made it to the top? That's your own goal, isn't it? -Intent owns my firm, don't they? -Should I be shocked? Why did you authorize a $50,000 check for me as a bonus and a broad hint to travel around the world. I must be a soft-hearted idiot, obviously. -Not to stop me asking questions. -Well, if I wanted to, and if I was malevolent, as Ms. Leighton makes out, then it would have been possible to have you removed. -It's awfully pat. Two plus 2 equals 4 is pat. But it's true. Miss Leighton, I'm sorry about your manuscript, but it maligns me. Now, I've had to pay out money to lawyers to point that out to publishers. -Seven people died when you acquired Sheridan Oil 10 years ago. -It can take years to clinch deals. Some people die every time a merger is set up. But I did not invent the accident of death. -Have you invested in certain African dictators? -Yes, I have. And so have some other Western nations, as well. -You rank yourself a nation? I'm bigger than some. Better managed than most. -Candia. -Let's go. -Steve, wait. -I'm not crazy. He couldn't have arranged all this in such a short time. -He could have expected this. -No. -So, I'm crazy. -Yeah. -May I say how sorry I am. Truly. I'll burn what I've written. -Well, I never thought I would hear you say that, Miss Leighton. But why don't you both stay and have dinner with me. -No, thanks. Well, I'll arrange for my helicopter to take you back to Dublin. -Corsica? What's in Corsica? My dad. He retired down there after the war with a bunch of his buddies from World War II, you know. They're all ex-commandos in a group together. This was after my mom died. -Sounds a bit eccentric. No, not really. Not when you meet him. Thorton Donegin, they're all there together, you know, sharing their moments against the Nazis and I'm kind of desperate to see him. It's really hard, you know, after what happened. -I'd like to meet him. -Yeah. Have a good trip to London and I'll see you when I get back. -Oh, Lordy. Don't know what I'm going to work on next. Spent so long on this. -Yeah. Well, -Maybe there's a story in Corsica. -I don't want you to come with me. -I'm going. I'm going to Corsica. -No, you're not. -Yes, I am. I'm going. I've decided. -You know, I can change the mind and dislike you, you know. -Look, I'm going to Corsica because I feel like it. That's all. I just feel like it. -Women's lib. All right. Buy your own ticket and carry your own bag. -All right, I will. -Give me the bag. -She does look like Cynthia some. -She sure does. -No, no, no. Not interested. Too soon. -You're surrounded by your old crew of relics aren't you. -Heh, heh. You'd be amazed. I'd still take any one of them into battle with me. You still think you could go 15 rounds, don't you? -When did you become arrogant? [CHUCKLING] I know, I know. -Yeah, they're warriors. In my memory, the best. Good, I'm the stranger. But they tolerate me. What upsets them lately is that new perfume they're building down there. -Smells? -In several ways. It's bringing a lot of strangers in. The world's impinging on them. That hotel down the road, building an annex. It's all getting too civilized. It's changed. They, well, they can't enjoy it. -And you? -I hate it too. It was just a nice little stretch of beach to get washed up on, a shaft of sun to sit in the evening of my life, listening to the Mediterranean, sculpting, looking at faces. Faces I remember very clearly. Looking scared to death and brave both at once. -Yeah. Soon that thing's going to start. Chimneys spewing fumes. There'll be dead birds. Fish washing up, sick to death. People start waking up coughing their lungs out. Oh, oh, those, those old fellows heh, they're mad as wet hens. Where did your lady go? My lady, I don't-- Here she comes. Right now. -Hey. -Hi. Catch your breath. Steve, there's this perfume factory. We were just discussing it. -It's owned by Intent -Owned by Intent. What don't they own? Who cares? -Steve, listen. There's a man at the hotel, he just arrived. I think he works for Hunt. He's in charge of security. And uh, there's a man with him. His name is Tooms. -What? -Yeah. There he is. Right there. -Candi, we've been had. Gray Harrison Hunt murdered my kids. -Is that your Mr. Timmons? -Is that the fellow that broke into your house looking for the briefcase? But you don't have that thing, do you? -Oh, lord. Steve. You do. Maybe you like to come with me to a little protest meeting tonight about the perfume factory. The local capo will be there. [SPEAKING FRENCH] -The capo says he'll accept your offer of technical assistance during the matter of this night. As to the other thing, he'll abide by your deal. It is a deal. O I help him. I'll certainly help you. But he's got to keep his word on the other thing. -He's given you his hand. They always keep their word. -Capo. This security fellow, Tooms, he'll check up after and find out you've been here. -I'm counting on that. -He'll tell Hunt. Hunt know you were a Green Beret? He'll figure it. -I hope so. You know something, Dad? This is going to be like my calling card. This Harrison Hunt fellow. He'll know I'm onto him. that he murdered our family. I'm going to get him. [HOOVES CLATTERING] [BARKING] -Hey. [THUD] [EXPLOSIONS] Medwin. I know you know the number. So just pick up the phone and call him. -You're out of your mind. -Tell him. If he's interested I've got the briefcase with the papers he wants inside it. -You're cracking up, you know that. -Tell him I want to two million American dollars in cash in a suitcase. -I never heard of anyone called Gray Harrison Hunt. I swear to you. -Tell him I want to see him in person or the deal's off. At 8 o'clock tomorrow in St. Patrick's Cathedral. Eight a.m. Eight a.m. [CHURCH BELL] -Well, now, my son. Just keep your hands away from that briefcase. -How very foolish, Mr. Donegin. How naive. -Now I fear I must leave you. You know what to do, Mr. Tooms. Keep him here for an hour and a half until I'm airborne and well away. Then you may complete the job for which you've been seeking the permission So persistently for the past ten days. Do you know, all this need never have happened. We need never have been enemies. I had nothing personal against your family. The whole thing was just a stupid accident. -Mr. Hunt. Am I right? -Ah, yes, indeed. You must forgive me. I'm in something of a hurry. -And I'm in the Irish police force. -Oh. Well, what's it about? -Well if you wouldn't mind stepping into the office. Thank you very much. This way, Mr. Hunt. -These cases are yours, Mr. Hunt, yes? Yes, indeed. -Yes, and the contents, your own personal possessions? -Yes, of course. -I wonder if you'd be do kind as to-- There's quite a lot of money there. If I may say so. -Not really. My own personal currency. I brought it into Ireland this morning. To trade every penny of it. You can check with the Currency Patrol. -Yes, I've done that already. And the, uh, the other case, Mr. Hunt? Company papers Ah,yes. Well, if you'd be good enough to-- -Thank you. [SLICING SOUND] -It's heroin. -What do you mean, heroin? -Oh, afraid that's what it is, Mr. Hunt. Yes, there's been a terrible lot coming in from Corsica lately. -Corsica? -Hm. -Oh, I see. You do realize don't you, Inspector, that this is a setup? I understood you to say, Mr. Hunt, that all the contents of these cases are your own personal property. However, I'm sure you can make a satisfactory statement at the Central Police Station. So if you'll come along with me now, Mr. Hunt. -Look, Inspector. -Hm, hm. I'm a very busy man. A very rich man. I don't need to do this sort of thing. And I don't think this sort of publicity. Why can't we just sort this out, man to man. Why don't you take this attache case and the heroin, and I'll just take the company papers and leave. We'll say nothing more about it. -Hm. And that's your second serious offense today, Mr. Hunt. -Yes, sir. Last night. Just as soon as he had a bag packed. Right now. He told me to forward his letters to um, see her now, Mount Brandon Hotel, Tralee. I hope he won't mind me giving it to you. -Don't you worry about it. He'll never reproach you for it. [HELICOPTER NOISE[ -Oh, you just missed him. He followed the train. Up over the mountain. I think he went fishing. For he was dressed in green. -Thank you. -All right, fan out. -Hey. [SCREAM] -Don't panic. That's what he wants us to do. Come on. [GUN SHOT] -Stupid fool, you hit Grossman. Donegin. Give up. Show yourself and I'll make a deal. [GUN SHOTS] Donegin. You change your name. Go back to America. I'll say that we, we buried you. [GUN SHOTS] What do you say? [GUN SHOTS] -Good day, Mr. Donegin. -Ah, Mr. Tooms. It is Mr. Tooms, isn't it? -(SHAKILY) He's going to kill me. -Oh, is that so now? -(FEARFULLY) You know he's going to kill me. -Um, are you going to kill this gentleman, Mr. Donegin? -Ah, well, good day to you. -You can't leave me here. (TEARILY) Take me into charge. I insist you take me in charge. -You see, Mr. Tooms, under the laws of this country, I can only take a man into charge if I reasonably believe he's guilty of a serious offense. Or maybe a material witness in the commission of a serious offense. -Wait. Wait. You can't leave me here with him. I'll give you the evidence. -You will? -Yes. Right, so. Now just uh. Here we are. I am Jasper Tooms, age 43 years. That right? -Yes. Resident of Switzerland. On the morning of April the 18th in the city of Rome in company with another man whom I identify as Fritz Grossman, right? I installed in the wingroot of an executive aircraft a combustible device with intent thereby to cause loss of life. I did this on the express orders given to me personally the previous day by one Gray Harrison Hunt. Would you please, uh, sign this for me. There we go. Thank you. Right, boys. -Well there you are now, Steve. There's your big jack pike fish for you. Hooked, netted and on the dike. Never back into the water for him. But you know that yourself. I'd get rid of that thing if I were you. It's out of date already. -Not now, my love?
