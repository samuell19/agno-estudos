You will be in Nice tomorrow night, huh? - That's what you wanted, isn't it? Beautiful, Diane. Splendid. Two weeks in Budapest. Two weeks, huh? When will you be back in Paris? Whenever you wish. Whenever the spirit moves you. Oh, darling. You make everything so simple. Always. Come in. If your business permits, we might spend August in Scotland, yes? Message for madame. Merciful heavens. The roof has fallen in on us. Who said anything about a roof? My dear, our trip to Nice is off. In fact, our whole world has been knocked six ways from Sunday. What is the matter, Diane? - Read that. That is amazing. I didn't know you had a daughter. I had almost forgotten it myself. 'I would like to make your acquaintance if it's alright with you'. She is amusing. 'My father died three months ago'. Did you know that? - No. It's the first I've heard of it. The child is in London. - Yes. Just landed from America. She will be in Paris tomorrow. - Well, well. Tremendous. She is American of course? My late husband was a puritanical soul. The courts gave him this child. I couldn't even see her. So I did my best to forget her. In heaven's name what am I to do with her? This is out of the blue, Andr?. I am upset. We must give it some consideration. She may be just as rigid and as stupid as her father for all I know. What would you suggest? You are so sweet and kind, Andr?. What do you think? You would like her here? - Yes. No. Of course. Why not? How long is she going to be here? Not long. It is just a visit. She's been brought up to hate me. She won't stay long. Don't worry, darling. We'll fix up everything. And I promise you to be .. Very careful. Very careful. Bonjour from me. Tony. Come up, Tony. Somebody told me you were leaving town today. I thought I'd toddle in to say au revoir before I went home and hit that bed. Because once I get tucked in that bed all Paris can leave and I won't care. Hello, Di. - Hello, Tony dear. I apologise for coming in the middle of the night like this. I'm just coming home from a party. Believe it or not, I'm not trying to get a job as a waiter. He will take her off your hands. And show her Paris. Take who off whose hands? Diane has a daughter arriving tomorrow. What do you think about that, huh? A little blessed event, eh? How do you know it will be a daughter? She is nineteen, Tony dear. - And beautiful like Diane herself. Madame, there is a young lady downstairs. Who says she thinks she is your daughter. In the name all that's holy .. Alyce. Fetch me my suit jacket. Oui, Monsieur. Tout de suite. A fine beginning. Surprising me like this. Say I'll be down shortly. Marie, bring champagne and glasses s'il vous pla?t. Oui, Monsieur. Tony, Tony, Tony. Please do watch what you say. There is no use shocking this young innocent. Lord, look at me. I am shaking like a leaf. The idea. Breaking in on my like this after fourteen years. Do come along, you two. I will need support. Well. How do you do, my dear. If I wasn't so tired I'd be excited. Not bad. Not bad at all. Well. Should I do this? Or throw my arms about you or what? That is twice you have surprised me. Monsieur de Graignon. - Enchant?. Tony Gerard. Our committee arranged for your entertainment. How nice. - Welcome. Had breakfast? Yes, thanks. In London. My, how she does move. - We expected you tomorrow. Did you ever spend a Sunday in London? I hope you don't mind. I was rather lonely and I .. I got to thinking of you and just had to hurry. You knew you were flying straight to me? - I would have come yesterday. Well, where have you been .. - All of your life? The little boy went out to play last night. The Sandman crept up on him before he got home. I see. Child, if there is anything I can do .. - Thank you. Your charming mother will let me know. You're such a delightful surprise. Au revoir. - Au revoir. Where are your things? - American Express. You see, I felt I should wait. My dear, we'll send for them at once. - I will be back in an hour. Dressed and in my right mind. We'll drive to the Boire. Tea at the Ch?teau Madrid. Then back at the Ritz for cocktails. So we'll get all dressed up again and go places, huh? Well, it is an offer. As we used to say in dear old America. I laid one over the plate and she wanged it out of the box. See you later, Tony boy. - So you will. Come along, Val. Goodbye. When the apples fall I am always right under the tree. So you are my mother. And I'm glad to see you. You don't look half as wicked as I expected. Well, there are two sides to every story. And am I really welcome? - My darling. I think you are lovely. And no fool, thank heavens. You won't need a chaperone. - Oh, I have had plenty. No more. I give you liberty. Promise? Do you mind if I give you a big hug? Make it .. Big. Hey, Tony. Looking for me? Yeah. I will be right down. Come on. Let's go. I am crazy about you. It seems to me I've heard you say that before. Well the crack still goes. In Spain they call that baloney. I am mad about you. Yes. I know. You are a pretty gallant soul, Tony. You give them everything but you name, don't you. Don't be like that, Val. There are certain things I don't believe in. Like the sound of wedding bells. I am afraid you don't believe in anything. Oh yes I do. I believe in you. I know. You believe I will weaken eventual. What is the word? - No. To think I stayed sober just to hear you say that. Darling, Tony feels a drunk coming on. What? Tony is sober? We're going to cure that right away. - You might as well do it in comfort. What say, we all go over to my place? What you want, Val, is a bicycle built for two. A basket of lunch. - A leafy lane. A babbling brook. Birds singing. Oh, Tony. - Oh, rats. You know you are not treating me right, honey. I want you and me alone. Forever, Tony? For ever? Sure. It's forever. Oh, Tony. This is so sudden. Wait a minute, Val. I wouldn't let you marry me. Maybe sometime I'll catch you really helpless. I am serious, Val. I love you too much to put you in jail for life. I am afraid you don't mean right like our Little Nell. Oh, hello. Diane, you are a great girl. What you are trying to say is, you are hungry. Bad manners. Here you are, Tony. What is the matter? Di. Valentine is so old-fashioned. Confound it. So old-fashioned. No. She is a wonderful girl, Tony. Oh, sure she is. But .. Why can't she have the same ideas you and I have? Don't you get too drunk and talk too much. Will you? Oh, certainly not. But listen, Di. Val is wasting .. The best years of her life. Uhuh. Cellini, behave. You know Diane is much too young for that. And besides, Tony. One idea isn't enough for a whole life plan. Look. Especially if you're cramped for room, eh Tony? You are a couple of very tiresome women. Where do you think you're going now? I am going out to sow wild oats. I don't like your Sunday School. A nice quiet evening at home. What on earth ..? Shush. I've got New York. What do you think you are going to do with it? [ Radio. French language ] [ French language ] Where do you think you are going at the crack of dawn? I thought you were asleep. You did, did you? Are you sure you weren't trying to sneak out on me? If you put it like that. I was. Come over here and let me look at you. Turn around. You young people. I don't object to you going to bed at six o'clock in the morning but .. Here you are. Off again. I don't know how you stand it. Want your breakfast? - Uhuh. Where are you off to? The races. Want to come? No thanks. I've got a date with Tony. Oh. Champagne dies hard, doesn't it. That is just a stage. You'll conquer it. How? Just sip it. Don't drink it. How do you know when it's enough? When you feel like saying 'Yes, Tony'. Quit and come over to mother. What on earth is the matter? Have you two been drinking again? Oh. It is you. Tony. Listen. Wake up. Come on. Hey. What are you two girls doing in my bedroom? Don't be a fool, Tony. This isn't your bedroom. What is it then? - It's tomorrow and you are an elk. Come on. Hey, how did I get here? - We had a party last night. A party? Was I there? Yes I was. - I'm afraid you were. [ Car horn ] Mon dieu. There is Andr?. Stay and tell him bedtime stories if you want to, but I am off. Hey, wait a minute. You are forgetting things. Au revoir, sweet. Say hello to Andr?. - Be good. Say Tony, where do you think you are going? To bed. Listen, stupid. You can't sleep here. You can't blame a guy for trying. Oh. Speaking of trying. You insulted me last night. What, again? - Yes. Again. Did I have any luck? Do you ever? Hey, wait a minute. About tonight? Shall I pick you up? - Not on your life. I want to get there. I will pick you up. Tony, will you keep your hands on the wheel? I suppose it never occurred to you that I might be in love with you. Now I know you are drunk. Go ahead. Go ahead. Discourage the goodness in me. [ Car horn ] Hey, Tony. See that building over there? Yep. I doubt it, but it might interest you to know that we've passed it four times. Well, it's a nice building, isn't it. - Oh. You sap. Come on. Just to be different. Let's turn to the right, huh? A lovely evening, isn't it. Could you by any chance tell me if that is the North Star or Ursa Minoris? I am awfully sorry. I had no idea. Are you alright? I'll tell you in a minute. Do you mind? I hope you are not hurt. Look at my knee. - Oh. That is too bad. It could have been worse. - Yes. I suppose. Is there something I can do for you? Yes. - What? I don't know. What do you suggest? I think I had better take you home. Oh, Tony. Tony? - Yes. He's under the car. Good heavens. Hey. He looks hurt to me. No. He is just relaxing. - Here. Take his hat. Come on, Tony. Come on, Tony. Snap out of it. Come on. Up and at 'em. Tony. Do be quiet. Come on. - He's not hurt. Come on. Get going, Tony. The idea is to keep him moving. - Uhuh. Are you alright? - Yes. Sure. Attaboy. Come on, lift 'em up. You had better watch him or he will go into a tailspin. Shall I call a taxi? No. Never mind. It's only a few blocks and he needs the exercise. Then I'll see that you get him safely home. I wish you would. You know, the last time he got away from me .. A gendarme found him asleep on Napoleon's tomb. No? - Yes. He probably thought it was Josephine. Good grief. Tony. Say, Tony. You can't sleep here. I bet you I can. - Come on. Can we get in okay? - Yep. Okay. Bring in the body. In we go. Where do you want him? Well, the first thing to do in a case like this is to first remove the hat .. And then the coat. There we are. Tony! Here you are. Dump him on the bed. - Okay. Round we go. Have you fixed up a .. Two minutes, young fellow. And I thought this was going to be a dull evening. Did you? - Uhuh. Well. I guess that is all he'll need for a while. Say. What does one have to do to rate service like that? Make virtues of all your vices. Never take anything seriously and always be amusing. That is a pretty tall order. It is a gift. A drink? You have really earned one you know. No thanks, just the same. You must be the fellow I read about. A cigarette? - Yes. Thanks. Here you are. Thanks again. I guess I had better be running along now. I hope your husband will be feeling better in the morning. I beg your pardon. My what? Your husband. Are you trying to be funny? Then he's not your husband? Of course not. I am sorry if I got that impression. But you see the key and .. Well, everything. There could be a lot of answers to that. What do you think? In that case I think I would like to see you home. Not so dumb. Is that wooden arm? Hard as a lamppost. Head and arm still hard from football. Shall we go? What is the name please? - Robert Blake. Harvard? Bob Blake? - Uhuh. Gee, that's funny. I saw you play Dartmouth last year. You saw us take a shellacking. - But I swear it wasn't your fault. So long, Tony. See you the day after tomorrow when you wake up. Have I kept you tramping too much? - No, no. We are home now. Ah. The ancestral castle, eh? - Hmm. I'll bet you had .. Possibly the most boring evening you've had in Paris. Far from it. Say, don't you drink or anything? When I was seventeen I was a son-of-a-gun. Braggart. Why? Do you have to have that kind of goings-on? You look as though you wanted to know. On the level. I never met anyone in my whole life that I've wanted to know quite so much about. Well? I was brought up as cautiously as a prize Pekingese until two months ago. Then Paris, champagne, wild parties. That is the whole awful story. Tell me. - Huh? Do you like me? - Why? Because I've either got to see a great deal of you or never see you again. You are a serious critter, aren't you. - Hmm. Right now I am. Sure. I like you. But you can't tell that two people who ran into each other just hours ago .. But why so serious anyhow? Alright. Alright. Quit kidding me. How about lunch? - What time? What time do you get up? - Lunchtime. That's alright. Oh. Now you are going to meet the most delightful woman in Paris. How long is it going to be like this? I will phone you in the morning. Is your rouge on straight? Yes. And every eyelash in place. I want you to know Mr Blake. Bob, my mother. Look and be amazed. How do you do? American, Mr Blake? You mean your sister, don't you? Uhoh. He'll do. And about lunch. I tell you what. I will come at twelve and wait. It's a great pleasure I'm sure. Mother. Of course, I still don't believe it. 12 o'clock. - I suppose so. Bye. - Goodbye. Well, where did you find that? Don't like? - Very nice. But I don't like the dominating note. I suspect he has it plenty. Where did you meet him? I picked him up in the Boire. - What? Tony and I had an accident. Serious? - Uhuh. Unless this is. Is he a Massachusetts Blake, this lad? Harvard. All-American half for two years running. Quite a boy. These Blakes are stiffer than your father ever was. Don't get panicked. I just met him. Darling. How do you know when you are in love? Tell me how you feel. I'm an expert on it. Well. We walked around Paris for hours. Looked in shop windows and watched children dancing. And no champagne either. - How frightful. I wasn't bored for a minute. And. I had a funny little catch here when he left just now. Listen, darling. Don't fall in love. Not just yet. I never knew what a person could mean until you came to me. Sweet. For years I wondered why I went out. Why I came home. Why I was alive. If I lost you again .. I don't know what I would do. Poor darling. Pull yourself together. You are just a stranger. You know. You must have been awfully silly when you were younger. What? - To be so suspicious. Gosh. This is lovely. What is? I don't know. Another month. Home and hard labor. Yes. Will you marry me, Valentine? You get to things so gradually. I can't go home or any place without you. I can't live without you. Did anybody ask you to? Well, Andr?. As usual, I have had a very pleasant evening. Splendid. Won't you take off your coat? Won't I have to put it on again? Well, that is not such a job. Thanks, Diane. There is something to say. - Yes? You .. Won't pretend to be surprised? No I won't. You have been very, very polite. And exceedingly patient. For nearly three months. I have been a stranger here. I've been embarrassed. I can have no more of it. Diane. We have had seven years of very charming companionship. If it must end .. It ends now. - Please wait. The answer is very simple and it is entirely with you. Don't be stupid. It is not simple. No? - No. If suddenly you take away this house, my background I must explain to Valentine. I don't want to see the look in her eyes when she finds out. I am sorry, Dianne. But that is your affair. I am afraid it is. You see, Andr?. I've lied to Valentine. And she believed me. Now there is a ghost of every worthless day I've lived ready to jump out. When she sees one she sees all. I cannot face that, Andr?. I can't. I can only beg for a little mercy. A little time to see what I can do. Not for myself. A little time. Please. Please, please. I am taking my family to Carlsbad. I shall be away ten days. Or two weeks. I will give you that much time. Diane. I am sorry. Awfully sorry. But there is nothing else for me to do. Is there? Hello, stranger. We're just bringing the booze because you deserted us. One big kiss and all his forgiven. Look out. The horse might turn around and die of shame. And anyhow. You wouldn't like to kiss an engaged woman, would you? Engaged? - Yes. Congratulation, Valentine. Don't cheer, folks. The girl is hurt. Listen, Blake old man. You're not going to cut this gorgeous girl off like that. Don't do that. Tony, the least you can do is be polite. - No. I am going to be honest. I am going to stop this if I have to walk into church and wreck it. Listen, Val. Marrying him is a bigger mistake than marrying me. Drive on. - Whoa. Do you know that everyone who married wishes they weren't? You should get out in the daytime. You don't meet good people. Blake. Rich birds like you have thought like you do since the stone age. Tony, don't make a scene here. - Don't worry. He won't. Come on. Diane. Diane, where are you? I am just about to take a bath. - Come on out here. Just a moment. - You can take a bath any old time. I have news and it won't wait. Hurry up. Come on. You'd better sit down before you fall down. I have glad tidings of great joy. You are engaged to marry Bob Blake? Oh. Why didn't you let me make a big fuss about it myself? Really engaged, huh? I was in such a hurry about it that I wanted to give you a great big hug. If it hadn't been for you I would never have met him. Just think of it, Diane. Suppose I had never met him. People must be sorry for thinking this is a tough, rough old world. I think it is a lovely world. Here I am rattling on like a selfish little beast. After all we've said about not losing each other too. But we'll never really lose each other again, Diane. Because Bob and I talked that over too. And I told him how lonely your life had been. How soon are you going to get married? I don't know. I am going down to Chantilly for the weekend to meet his mother and father. Do you think they'll like me, Diane? I am scared to death. When are you planning on doing it? That is up to you .. and his people too. There is no wild hurry about it. Except the way I feel about us. Does he feel the same? - Hmm. Only worse. Then why wait for anybody? What do you mean? - Why not elope? Then, when you meet his people, say: 'here we are'. 'I hope you like it'. Well, that is a surprise. I've always thought there should only be two people at a wedding. The fuss is a nuisance and not decent. - Not decent? I don't know what you mean. But I want the church and the music and the bells. And you weeping. The organ playing. I want it to be so grand and sentimental I'll never forget it. Oh, poor Diane. I guess you never married the man you loved, did you? I am sorry you missed that. It's wonderful. Oh .. dear. I am trying not to be selfish. I'm thinking of a lot of things. Would you mind if I took a bath myself? Of course not. Go ahead. Wash yourself clean. Then say a nice little prayer that I will be a good and happy wife. Then everything will be okay, huh? Da, da, de, da, de, da. Uhuh, mother. Uhuh. You are cheating. I know. I know. But .. It's my game and that is the way I play it. I see steel is down ten points. Dad, don't think of that now. You came over here for a vacation. By the way, Robert. - Hmm? Who is the young lady that you have invited down for the weekend? Valentine Winters. - Yes, I know. But who is she? She's a very charming girl, mother. I know, but who are her people? Her father died recently and she came to Paris to be with her mother. Didn't her parents live together? No. Not exactly. They were divorced I believe. Oh. Come now, mother. We can't blame Valentine for what her parents do. My dear boy, I didn't say a word. - No. I know you didn't. But that is just the point. I happen to know what you're thinking. Wait until you see her. Just wait until you see her. Who introduced you to this young lady, Robert? Well. You'd scarcely call it an introduction. It was .. It was more of an accident if you know what I mean. [ Doorbell ] Here she is now. Now, you will be nice to her? Make her feel at home. Bobby. - Val. Bobby, darling. Do you realize it has been two whole long days? Do I? Oh yes. Mother. This is Valentine. - How do you do? Valentine, this is dad. - How do you do? So glad you could come down. Did you have a pleasant journey? Great. Hit seventy all the way. You must be very tired. Let me show you to your room. - Thank you. I guess I do look like the Dickens. Pardon me. Do you think they like me? Don't be silly. You are a great help. Well, dad? Well? Well, what do you think of the future Mrs Robert Blake Junior? Well, son. We'll see how it works itself out. Dad, wait until you get to know her a little better. She is a great girl. Say, you had better be getting to bed. Do you realise what time it is? - What does it matter? We've had such a glorious evening. It has been grand, hasn't it. Perfectly divine. I hate to think of ending it. But just as you say .. 1890. To bed I go. You're sure you are not trying to get rid of me? I hate to even think about it. Shush. You will wake the folks. - Alright. I have to go. [ Creaking floorboards ] I can't help it. - It's an old house. Where? Where is the mouse? I said it was an old house. Oh. I thought you said it was a mouse. Shush. Gee, your head is hard. - Yours is no sponge. We're the crawling wounded. Shush. I'll take the milk. We are all out of vanilla. - What have you then? We've got chocolate. I don't like chocolate. Do you love me? Of course I do. - How much? You really want to know? More than anything else in the whole world. Goodnight. - Goodnight. You'd better get in there and close that door. Really? Yes. Really. Goody, goody, goody. Give me some more. Get in there, young lady. Get in there. Goodnight, Bobby. Don't forget to tell Diane my suggestion about Friday night. Of course not. And if you don't want Tony and Andr? .. We won't have them. - It isn't that I don't want them. I just have a feeling that mother and dad won't understand them. That's not very convincing, but okay. You are an angel. Mother is in the garden. Don't bother coming in. I will see you tonight? - Couldn't you make it sooner? Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hello Valentine. Here I am. Hello darling. - Hello, my dear. No wonder you stay so fascinating. Well then, tell me. Don't you know I am dying of curiosity. What sort of a time did you have? Were Bob's people nice to you? Did they like you? Wait a minute. One question at a time. I'm done with you, Alyce. Well, it is a long story and an olden one too. Once upon a time there was a child .. - Stop that and tell me. Well. To tell you the truth. It was a very quiet weekend but strangely enough I enjoyed it. Really? - Really. Bob has the nicest people. They were awfully sweet about our engagement. I should like to know why not. - Don't get excited. Nobody said anything about your precious child. I hope not. If you must be maternal I'll give you something to be maternal about. Number one. As a potential mother-in-law .. You'll drag your beautiful self to the phone and invite the Blakes for dinner. On Friday night. Number two. That dinner party is to be strictly a family affair. Andr? is out of town. Good. We won't have to ask anybody then. Darling. I know it will be difficult. But do you think you could manage to be on your best behaviour on Friday night? My best behaviour? Which is nothing to brag about. No blowing of horns or sliding down bannisters or anything like that, huh? Really, Margaret. There was no reason for giving me that last raise. There is no law against keeping stealers, you know. Nonsense, dad. You will make it. Of course I will. But you should not bet on my good playing. I inherit father's modesty. It's a pity you don't inherit his game, my boy. Bonsoir, Monsieur. - Bonsoir, Alyce. Madame has company. Andr?. When did you get back? - I just got off the train. I hope you will pardon my appearance. - Certainly. This is Bob's father and mother. Mr and Mrs Blake. Mr de Graignon. - Hello. Enchant?. - How do you do? Monsieur. Hello children. - Hello Andr?. Bob, don't you play bridge? Do I play? Why, I am one of the very best. Then perhaps I can borrow Diane for a second? Do you mind? You bet your life they mind. A different kind of opposition altogether. But this is bridge. Not football. An inheritance. His father's modesty. Company. Halt! Well. And a hearty greeting was extended to one and all. You idiots. Come in and make yourselves at home but don't bother me. I am busy. Come along. Let's finish our game. Company. Attention! Corporal. Dismiss your guard. Okay. Company. As you were. Carry on. Don't, Tony. Sorry, Blake. It's an old habit of mine. You will have to get used to it. Tony. I'd like you to know Bob's mother and father. Mr and Mrs Blake - Mr Gerard. How do you do. - Hello. Gerard? Did you say Tony Gerard? - Yes. There was an Anthony Gerard back home. I wonder if by any chance you are related to him. Well, slightly. He is my old man. Oh. That 'Oh' is not the half of it. Hey. Tony. Come and get it. Believe me, sir. She has got it. Will you pardon me? Yes. Let's see. Where were we? Val, where is the Scotch? In the cabinet. Lower shelf. Is it my play? What lower shelf? Alright. I will show you. Pardon me, please. Thank you. Bob. I am awfully sorry. Yes. I know you are. But you had nothing to do with it. When Tony said he'd blow us under the rocks. That's all. It's just funny. But your mother and father. - They will get over it. Behave, will you. Aren't you the sweetest thing. One. Two. Three. Four. The winner. Elsie Josenheim. Do you think that Valentine is mad at us? I am afraid she is at me. And I can't blame her very much. Ah, mon cheri. Mr Gerard has a way with him. He comes by it naturally. Just a modern version of his father's technique. I am so sorry about the interruptions. Let's see. Where were we? If it's all the same to you my dear, I think we'll be going. Just one more rubber. Please. I am afraid not, my dear. It is getting late. Oh. I wish I could persuade you. Bob, will you try to find Diane. - Yes. Surely. I don't want to be disagreeable. But here I am. This is my house. Filled with people I don't know or care about. I cannot withdraw for fear that your daughter might find out. Of all the stupid positions a man ever found himself in .. Where is Diane? I couldn't find her. Pardon me. I'll get her. Please don't trouble, my dear. Just say goodnight to her for us. Goodnight, darling. Don't bother to wait up. I will be along later. Goodnight. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight, dad. Valentine, I want to talk to you. Shall we go in here? - Sure. What's the matter, Bob? Is anything wrong? Oh no. Nothing. I just had a whale of an idea. That is all. I always look funny when I have an idea. What is on your mind? Let's get married, Val. Tonight or tomorrow or just as soon as it can be done. Why the sudden rush? - I've got my reasons. Why not? I am so crazy about you, Val. I want to get you away all to myself. Where I can look after you the rest of your life. I will do anything you say, Bob. I want to take you off someplace. Where nothing but the finest and the best can ever get anywhere near you. You did let Tony and his gang bother you, didn't you? No. He's just part of the general background that I want to yank you out of. You are too good for them, Val. You have got no business in it. Darling. I am going to come to no harm. When it comes to really important things, Diane is mighty careful. You think so? Why, yes. Don't you? Well, I've little use for the crowd or general surroundings she's given you. They're really quite harmless. They are a bunch of half-world nitwits. They are the only kind of people that she has any right to have around. They are not good enough for you, Val. I want to get you out of it and get you out quick. Meaning they're not good enough for you. Isn't that what you mean? They're not good enough for anyone who even makes a pretence of respectability. That is what I mean. - Do you include Diane? It is Diane that I am talking about. The rest don't make any difference. Bob, quit hiding behind words that aren't clear. Let's have it. Well, do you know who owns this house that you are living in? No. I thought not. Well, it belongs to Monsieur Andr? de Graignon. That is a lie and I don't believe it. What you believe is beside the point, but I am not lying. There is no use in beating about the bush. There couldn't be any compromise. You must make up your mind to forget all about her and live up to it. What kind of filthy gossip have you been listening to? How dare you or anybody even think of my mother like that. How dare you. I'm telling you facts. That is all. And I know what I am talking about. You have got no business here. The atmosphere is rotten. In a month you won't know your home from a roadhouse. And Diane is as bad as the rest of them. - Bob, stop that. A blessing I've found out about you before it's too late. I may have had the same brutal treatment my mother got from one of your kind. Now you listen to me. I happen to love my mother. And I wouldn't give a hair of her head for all the Blakes that ever lived. Tony is right about you. Absolutely. You good, smug people have been the same since the beginning of the world. Now you can go. As soon as you like. And as far as you like. If you're spending the rest of your life in this mess I'll have no part of it. Robert. You know, I don't think he likes us. Goodnight, Tony. Goodnight, Diane. Hello, sweet. - Hello, dear. Enjoy the Blakes? They seemed to be very nice people. - Are you trying to be funny? What? They're reserved, of course. But .. Know what I would like to do? What, dear? Just you and I find some funny little place along the shore. Get away for a while. Would you like that? What's at the bottom of all this? Well. Just at present, I'm fed up with people. Jabber, jabber, jabber. Let's get away. Where there's no rules. Nobody being the life of the party. Trouble with Bob? I had a better look at him tonight. Did you ever notice the back of his neck? Awfully stiff. It's as though he is always ready to say 'no' or make you say 'yes'. You are going to tell me what's wrong, Val. I thought you didn't want to lose me. I don't want you to lose the rest of your life. Does that depend on some one man? Bob Blake is very much in love with you. Nothing must happen to it. It has happened. Then it must be fixed up again. I'm afraid you don't know what you are talking about here. I wish you'd let me handle this myself. Maybe the Blakes object to me? They're very staunch Americans you know. They may not like divorcees. Ex-patriots. They are conservative. Anyone that doesn't want me for myself. Well, nothing doing. Then it was that. They do object to me. And anyone who objects to you .. Well, they are just out of luck with me. That's all. In the name of heaven, Val. Don't punish me like this. I don't understand you, Diane. Is some sick creature of a man going to tell me .. I must leave my mother where I found her and forget her? What did he say? I couldn't tell you. It is too horrible. I simply couldn't. Tell me what he said. Diane. It is the sort of thing that simply sickens you all over. But if you must have it. He said. He said this house you were living in. Where you were letting me live with you. Belonged to Andr?. Of course, this is something else. I can understand a woman doing anything. A mistake. Because she loves someone. But .. but for this .. And to let me live here. Diane, say something. Diane. Do you want to go on like this? There is only one thing in the world I care anything about now. And that is you. I would die for you willingly. Well, I think we are looking rather grand. For a couple of ladies that toil not. Neither do they sin. Happy? No. No like? - I love it. But? My darling. I would be a very foolish mother if I didn't know your heart was breaking. Just a little time and I will get over it. I'm not whining or drooping, am I? You know, sometimes when you think I'm asleep .. No, Diane. I am not kidding myself. It is tough. I love him terribly. We've got each other. If you ask me I think it is pretty darned nice. I think you are a peach. I am going shopping. Hey. If any strange men bother you, call a policeman. I am getting to be a big girl. Bye. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Hello, Tony. Well, since the mountain wouldn't come to Mohammed. Isn't this cute and virtuous. Why virtuous? How did you find us? From the recently discarded old love. Monsieur Andr? de Graignon. Andr?, huh? - Hmm. Where is Di? She is out shopping or something. So you're going to bring your mother up in the way that she should be, huh? Tony. Why didn't you wait until I telephoned you? Do you really mean that, Val? What I've been through isn't funny. And I don't like jokes. Just yet. I am sorry, Val. But one thing I've learned. You sure? - One is modesty. You can't cure a thing by hiding it. Besides, what was news to you was old stuff to me. Tony, do you insist? Well, I should say not. If you say so. Holy smokes, but you look sweet. I'm glad to see you. Really I am. I live again. Darling, you know I am crazy about you, don't you? In my Casanova fashion. How was the peace conference? Alright. Alright. How long have you lived in this dump? About two weeks. What is ahead of you? I suppose a job or something horrible like that? I don't know. I get three thousand a year, you know. We can live. Ha. You mean you can eat. Anyhow, Val. It was the best thing to ever happen to you. Or ever will. You were living in a kind-of .. Fool's paradise. It was bound to bust wide open. Like a drink? - No thanks. Mind if I do? - Of course not. I did a little drinking last night. Oh Tony. Not you? I can't bear it. If I'm staying here, talking my head off to you, I'll need plenty of lubrication. No use talking to me, Tony. I don't know what is ahead. Mother and I will go along quietly until we figure it out, I guess. Why don't you behave, Val? After three glassfuls of this there's not a problem left in the world. No thanks. Won't you listen to reason? Tony, dear. You see, I know everything you have to say. You do. - Listen. I'll give you an imitation of you. This happened at Diane's one night. You didn't want to go home. What did I want to do? You are asking me? 'Listen, Val'. 'Marriage isn't right'. 'It's a lot of horse feathers'. 'You want to be free. To come and go as you like'. 'To have a lot of fun'. Gee, I almost forgot the best part of it. 'Listen, Val'. 'I am talking to you just like a brother'. Like a brother, huh? Now, what have you to say for yourself? Plenty. There's a little Inn I found down in Normandy. It is a great place to forget. And I want you to see it. Oh, what a man. I'm staying here to talk to you until Di gets back and I hope she's gone to Rome. Onze dix-huit s'il vous pla?t. - Oui, madame. Number one. Hello? Hello, Andr?? Diane. I wonder if it would interest you to know that I am a free woman again. Attendez. Tony. You don't care what happens to Diane. There's no reason why you should, but .. But she is my mother. Someday I might be sorry I didn't take a satirical slant at the copybook stuff. But just now I can't. Rather than see her back where she was. I would do almost anything, Tony. Sure. I know. I suppose I ought to burst out crying or give you three cheers or something. But listen, Val. You can only .. Here I am. Val, you can only live one life. And that is your own. I don't care who the other one is. I never saw anybody who tried to be an influence .. Who didn't get kicked right smack in the chin for it. Hey. It looks like you're being paged by Mr Andr? de Graignon. Oh no, Tony. You poor kid. Hello, Tony. - Hello, Di. Partying as usual? - Yeah. I drank it all myself too. Give me a ring Val, will you. Val dear, don't look at me like that. I .. I couldn't stand it any longer. This I mean. I tried to erect a new set of morals for you but .. Habits are long-formed, you know. Try not to be too hard about it. I am paying the rent here, Diane. You are not welcome. I didn't think I would be. It took courage to come and make things clear. If I had tried to stick it out under protest .. You would hate me. It is better this way. Believe me. Andr? and I are leaving tonight for Berlin. I wonder. As a great concession. Will you let me put my arms around you? Just once. We won't bother about that. Good luck, darling. Wait a minute, Diane. Wait a minute. This thing is too sudden. Too monstrous. You can't mean it. I do mean it, Valentine. Diane, do you know what you are doing? Or have you gone completely mad? I put this thing squarely up to you once. I asked you what you wanted. You said you wanted nothing. Nothing but me. You said you would even die for me. Do you remember that? Do you? It is no use, Valentine. My mind is made up. It is the only thing to do. The joke is on me, I guess. I wouldn't keep Andr? waiting if I were you, dear. Champs-?lys?es onze dix-huit. Hello, Tony? You haven't anything against a nice big bottle of champagne, have you? No. I just want to find some of that fun you have been talking about. Yes, sure. Right away. Bob. How do you do. I am glad to see you didn't lose any time. What do you mean? Have you seen your father and mother? - No. Oh? Where is Valentine? I don't know. Maybe with Tony Gerard. Is she moving? No. I am. Does she know about this? - Yes. She feels badly but she'll get over it. So you couldn't stand the gaff, could you. Well, I have never despised you quite as much as I do now. When I think of what Valentine was willing to endure for you. Even when she knew what I said was true .. She was still ready to give up her life for you. And you wouldn't stick it out. Oh, I am sorry. Go on packing. I'll wait until she gets back. I don't believe any power in heaven or earth demands that I take this from you. Why don't you look in behind a little? For ever since Valentine came to me .. Every moment has been absolute torture. How to keep the facts. Away from her. And all it means to you is that you have caught me and exposed me. I went to your father and mother today and begged them .. Not to punish Valentine for what I am. I received from them the same terrible, frozen thing I am getting now. If I never see that girl of mine again it's quite alright with all of you. You went to my folks? Yes. That is why I am stepping out. It's the only chance Valentine has to be absolutely free of me. Just a minute. Let me get this. It's very simple. It's the only thing I can do. Are you telling me the truth, Diane? Is that why you are doing it? - Ask your people. They know. What did they say to you, Diane? My mother and father. What did they say? 'It's a respectable world'. 'If you break the rules you shall pay for it'. What contemptible, inhuman swine we have been. Listen, Diane. For two weeks I have lived in abject torture. I have been half crazy. Otherwise I couldn't possibly have been as brutally stupid. Please give me another chance. Please. And I'll make it up to you. Both of you. Bob. Do you mean this? Do you know what you are saying? Please forgive me. Please. And help me with Valentine. Oh, bless you, boy. I love you too. Now let's find her, shall we? You know honey, the first thing you got to learn is how to carry your liquor. You see how full this glass is? - Yeah. Right. Now watch Tony now. Here I go now. Ladies and gentlemen. For ten cents. One slim dime. Tony Gerard is loaded inside and out. And now he is going to drink the load. And now you are about to see something that has never been done before. How have you been? And I am as sober as a judge. You are sure? Hey, do you know something? What? We came all the way from Paris without anything to eat. Did we? Sure. Don't you remember? We stopped at a lot of places. Nothing with champagne though. I got to take much better care of you than that, darling. Sure. Take much better care of you than that. - Take much better care of me than that. Careful. I'll order prawn bisque. Tomorrow. Filets de sole Marguery. Gigot de mouton a la provencal. You cannot fool me. That is mutton for two. Are you going to take care of me, Tony? Am I? Say, Val. Do I love you. What is the matter, Val? Tell Tony all about it. What is the matter, huh? Nothing. I am just thinking of Diane. That is all. Sorry, Tony. Kiss me again. I promise not to be a quitter. Tony. Nobody cares what we do. Do they? Or where we go. Nobody. We can do exactly as we like. Right? Sure we can, Val. Then, after a couple of years .. If you want to and we're all crazy about each other .. We can get married. No harm in that. You see, dear. Then we will know each other. You'll love me won't you, Val? You will, won't you? I will do my best, Tony. But right now I am hungry. What's the matter, Val? - Tony, I've told you twice. I'm starving to death and you do nothing about it. [ Door knocks ] What do you mean, I do nothing about it? There he is now. Mutton for two. Come in. Mutton for two. Say, listen. Did you ever go anywhere that you were welcome? Where people were glad to see you? That is funny. I was just thinking of you. My car is downstairs. They can send on your things. Didn't you hear what I said? I said I was just thinking of you. - I know. We'll talk about that later. Listen here, Blake. - Tony. Keep quiet. What is this anyway? A rescue? Or did somebody tell you my mother has left me? I was thinking it's a pity I never got a chance to tell you what I think of you. If you're here to rescue the fallen so you can be a hero with yourself .. Then put it down as a flat failure. Because there is nothing to rescue. You've arrived too late. - You go with me of your own free will? I'm not afraid of what you call evil people. Not anymore. But I am afraid for my life from you sanctimonious fakers. If you must blame anybody but me for the way you find me, take it all yourself. My mother can go to the devil as far as you are concerned. You're not human or Christian or anything I ever want to see again. You're very right but you belong to me. - Nothing of the kind. I belong to Tony. That is all you have done to me. Do you hear? I belong to Tony. Now go back and tell that to the Blakes. Now get out. Get out! Why don't you .. - Go away. We'll have no more of this. You are going with me and the rest of the world can like it or lump it. No. You can't do this. I'll have the whole town after you. You can't pick me up and .. How dare you. Val. What are you doing here? He insisted. Then you are not going with .. - How could I? He wants to marry both of us. I wouldn't marry you .. - If I was the last man in the world. Get in. ..w-g..
