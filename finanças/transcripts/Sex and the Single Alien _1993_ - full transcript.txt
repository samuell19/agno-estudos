It's a research. - Research of what? - Extraterrestrial civilizations visiting Earth. - Visiting your head! - Harry they do exist. You are so ethnocentric. - Of course they exist, no question about it. What I mean to say is, that your research, is drawing alien spacecraft into our backyard like a magnet. - What magnet? - Go figure, what if these UFOs come here again tonight? - It's impossible, they never abduct the same human being twice, ever. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, yeah! - Oh, well, what if they amended the rule and didn't let you know about it? - What do you know about it anyway? You have a severe case of alien ignorance. - So it's saucer-safe out here. Okay, I'm out, . - What does that mean? - Russian, for good night. - They did it again? Holy shit, they did it again. Meg? Megan! They did it again. - What? - The aliens abducted Harry again. - Bastards. - The span between those two specimens is 19 centuries.

So what you're saying is, is that I did this to myself? So what you're saying is that I was masturbating? That's what you're saying? Goddamn son of a bitch Harry, how did you do this, how did you make love to me? - You tell me, you were closer. - Bullshit. Oh wow. - What happened? - I just had the most unbelievable fantasy. - Fantasies are good for humans, they get off on them. - Yeah, yeah yeah, wait, where did you get that from?

Fantasies are good for humans. - Olivia we're gonna be late for work. - Okay, I'll do it later. But by the way Harry, I've never masturbated in my life. - Yeah well try to remember when you were young and curious. - Do you mind, I am still young, I'm just not curious anymore. - I know. ♫ I never felt this way before ♫ He's gone all the way to my core ♫ I'm coming soon, it's a monsoon ♫ Wild sex ♫ Can't you see it in his eyes ♫ It's an alien in disguise ♫ He is in control, he's doing it all ♫ Wild sex ♫ Wild sex ♫ Wild, wild sex ♫ Anyone who goes through this kind of loving ♫ Never ever'll be the same ♫ Looks like just - You sure you didn't pick me up? - I told you I didn't. Is the pope Catholic, the balloon broke down, I told you that. - You didn't pick me up? - Why do you keep asking me that Harry? - I woke up in the desert Sam, dressed in Roman armor, sandals and sword, I'm talking full gear. - No shit? - No shit, I have it my living room. - And you don't remember a thing? - Total blackout. - Blackout, blackouts are the worst. I'm sure Thousand Ways was disappointed. No aerobics. - Sam, do me a favor. - What? - Watch this, okay? - What do you mean. - Trust me, just watch this and check out what happens. - What are you talking about? Wow. Oh dude. Wow. Oh! Mother! - What did you see Sam? - A miracle, forget the bar Harry, you could open a church. - You are so disgusting I can't believe I share this planet with you? - Excuse me, yes, yes, that was for the performance. And this is for the location. How did he do that? - I don't know, he did it to me first, on my kitchen floor this morning. - How was it? - Did you teach him how to do this? - Ladies, if I knew how to do that, I wouldn't be here, I'd be at the Miss America pageant. No one, come on. - Damn this sucks. - You have got to tell me how you do them long distance like that pal. - I don't know, I just focus in on a good looking babe, she gets off. - Harry, I've been focusing on good looking babes since I was 12 and nothing like that ever happened to me. - Where did she put the phone book? - Now what is it, come on? - Sam, I get these fantasies. It's sort of like a, like a brain flash. A neurologist. That's the ticket. - Hi there. - Hi. - Say hello Harry. - She's a very young girl Sam, I could go to jail for this. - Excuse me, who are you? - Uh, we have an appointment, Harry Smith. - Oh God, yeah I'm so sorry, I apologize, we had a little emergency, one of our patients, he went nuts and my father had to take him to the hospital. - Yeah well we have an emergency too, let's get another doctor, come on Sam. - Hey, hey wait a minute, what's his problem? - Whoa, whoa, all right, uh every babe he looks at has an orgasm. - Oh really, and how does he do that? - Uh, I don't know, I wish I did. - Well let me look at him, maybe I can help. - No uh, how old are you? - 19. - 19 Harry. - 19? - Yeah 19. Wow. Oh my. - Are you, how was that? - Well. First of all, I'm a virgin. - I thought you said you were 19. - How did he do that? That's ridiculous, scientifically it's impossible, there's no way, it, it has to be some sort of telepathy. - Telepathy. - Yeah. - That's it, telepathy. Well, can you help us? - Well I can examine him, follow me into the lab. Come on Harry. - Sit him in that chair right over there, okay? - That one over there? - Yeah. - All right. There you go Harry. - Okay. Now Harry, put your head back. Don't use your mind on me unless I tell you to, okay? Just be a gentleman. - Well I'm afraid you're gonna have an orgasm. - Just because I'm a virgin doesn't mean I don't know what an orgasm is. - Yeah well it's one thing to read it out of books and it's another thing to really-- - I didn't say that I knew it from books. Excuse me, but I'm very particular when it comes to the audience of my orgasms. Okay Dirty Harry go ahead, make my day. - You done? Well it was good for me, was it good for you? - You're disgusting. Let me get the reading. Wow, the activity in your reproduction center, it's awesome, 200,000 units. - 200,000 units, what's that? - It mean's you're a sex machine is what it means. - Shut up Sam! What does it mean? - Well I don't know, but I know that's it a lot. Are you married? - Yeah. - Oh well what did your wife think about this? - She slapped me in the face. - She didn't like it? - She wasn't the only one that didn't like it. - Oh well, that's bad. Look, what I think we can do is fix you up with a special helmet, can you go into that drawer right there, there's the helmet right in there. - Wow. - Great, thanks. This is only temporary until we look into this thing further, what this will do, is absorb any of the bio impulses emitted from your brain, okay? - Hmm-mm. - Let's get you strapped in. Okay. - Can I look at you? - Yeah go ahead. - Ain't science a bitch. - Hey good job. - Thank you very much. - Very nice. - Chill Sam. - Chill Sam, you know scientifically you are really a very valuable man. - Scientifically, you're the hottest chick I ever had. - No, no, you didn't have me. - Scientifically not. But you got off. - No, no, no, that was just like some kind of fantasy or something. - Well as the say, fantasies are good for humans, they get off on them. - Who says that? - I don't know, but it's a good saying. - Oh, is that your neighbor? - Hmm-mm. - Well focus on her, focus on her. - Nothing happens. - I guess that helmet really works huh? - Hmm-mm. - Hmm, smashing derriere on that babe. You sure you don't wanna take the helmet off? - Positive. - Not even for a quickie? - Forget it Sam, I would never cheat with my neighbor, never. N-E-V-E-R, never. Hi Meg. - Hi Harry. I'm doing your job. - I can see, hey how was your first thing in the morning? - It was all right, I had better. What's that thing on your head? - Oh, this is sort of a high tech condom. - A what? Oh Harry! Oh, oh Harry! What was that? - A quickie. - Phew, do you have any longies? - Out of stock gorgeous, Olivia would kick my butt. - Bye Harry. - I'm over here. Hey. - What'cha doing? - Doing my homework? Is this the helmet that the doctor came up with? - Actually it was the doctor's daughter she did a great job. - She did huh? - Hmm-mm. - And what did you do to her? - Well, the girl took it, scientifically. - Poor child, I can imagine what she must've gone through. You are such a pervert Harry. - She said she liked it. - Did she, did she really? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah? - Yeah. - The little bitch. - Very bitter. - Look do me a favor, don't take the helmet off, because I don't wanna get laid by your imagination again. - My imagination. - Yes, I found out in my files that you suffer from a very strong sexual hunger. - So? - So I'm gonna take care of you right now. Yeah, just sit back and relax. You can take your helmet off. - Am I cured? - Your sexual hunger is gone. - Forever? - For a few days. - Oh, okay, for a few days. Then what? - Then I'm gonna make love to you again, and you'll be all right for a few days. - Hmm, that's healthy, then what? - And then I'm gonna make love to you again, and you'll be all right for a few more days. - Geez, I'm gonna be one of the healthiest guys around. Did you learn this in one of them UFO books? - Hah, I found the article that I was looking for. It says that fantasies are good for humans.
