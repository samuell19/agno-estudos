A dangerous virus is spreading rapidly in China and U.S. officials are very worried that it could come here. China has more than 200 confirmed cases of Coronavirus, it's called, which produces pneumonia-like symptoms. Three people have already died from- - Wait. I love this photo because we really look like we're coming from mafia. My grandfather, his brother, my great-grandfather, my grandfather's other brothers, my great grandmother and my father lying here. Look, he was so cute. Okay, let's go get some wine guys. Oo, voila. This right here, has been my grandfather's restaurant for like 40, 50 years. The bottle opener from my grandpa. So you see, he's really part of my life all the time. Up, oh la la. There, voila. Who is Vincent Samarco? Vincent Samarco is a little guy, who has a lot of hopes and a lot of dreams. I'm a third generation Restaurateur. The first of the family was my grandfather from the Greek part of my family. He immigrated to South of France when he was a young man. He opened a restaurant in Paris. We used to go every Sunday. And when I was a child, he was just an amazing impression. I've been working in the restaurant industry since I'm only 18 years old. I've been working in Paris all my career until I immigrated to L.A. seven years ago. You know, I come to the United States, I want to do French food and to share my passion about French food. And that's kind of the easiest point, you know, like you're going to represent what you are. And what does it mean to be French? It's awesome. It's the best thing to be French. Well, you know, there's a lot of history. There's a good invocation. It means a lot to me to be French because we- People see us differently, you know, they see us as romantic, and they think we have so many wives, they have ideas and image of us, but you know, being French is like being anybody else, you know. It's just like- It's just cooler due to the accent. I totally agree, but we're just-Just the same. What does it mean to be American? It means to be a good immigrant. That's what it means to be a good American, you know. Belle Vie, bonsoir? Belle Vie, bonjour? Belle Vie, bonsoir? Belle Vie, bonjour? Belle Vie, beautiful life. Life in beautiful, that's it. You know, I live in Southern California, I have a restaurant, I'm happy. So, life is beautiful, Belle Vie. Where I'm located on Wilshire, between Bundy and Barrington and most importantly between McDonald's and KFC. Two big corporation, who feeds you crappy meat and put cardboard into your fries and- And people are waiting in line to go eat over there. It's freedom, people can eat the shit they want. A cheeseburger it's very cheap, I get it. Well, obviously in between a McDonald's and KFC is not the best location you can dream of but that's the one I could afford. The restaurant was very crappy. It was a restaurant from the 60's, 70's, has been changing hands for the last 50 years. I had to build everything from scratch. I had to do all the electricity, all the plumbing, all the trenches for the sewer. I built the tables myself, with my friend, Trenten. I bought piece of marble, glued them to a piece of wood, and created marble tables. I tried to do, invent even economic. I didn't have a lot of money. So it was literally just a little cube, and slowly, slowly through the years, I did more stuff, I installed more stuff to make it warmer. I remember when I opened we started with, like, 15 photos and painting on the wall. Now, I don't know how much there is, but there's a lot of them. The wall, I covered, everywhere. There's art everywhere to make it warm and, and- and decorative. The chef - right here. - Oh, yeah? With the PSG. I called Cedric, and I said, hey, man I'm about to open a restaurant. I can do your papers if you want to come. Would you like to come? And he said yes. We've been working together before already, so it's a team that goes back together. - We met 12 Years ago in Paris, working together in a small restaurant called Nomiya on the rooftop of a Le Palais de Tokyo which is a contemporary art museum. We opened first of August, like, four years ago. So it's coming really soon. The opening was August 1st, 2016. He's a very strict boss, by the way. I can't be late, which usually, in our normal life, I can be late, as late as I want to be. I've been late for dates like an hour and a half late. For dates. There was one day they came in, I was like, okay, I think, I think it's time for me to find somebody and just keep him waiting. It sounds very vague, but I was very nervous. I'm Ornella Samarco and I'm Vincent's wife. Well, the moment I first saw her, she was wearing a red dress and- And she was amazingly beautiful. Time stopped, like, for real. Like in the movies, like for real, that was a kind of weird. - I'm told by Julie, my friend, that the time stopped for about two minutes, because at some point I feel her tugging on my jacket. - You say like, oh, who's that girl? You see, I don't know, I want to know. Just a simple, basically, very beautiful love story. - I love you. - Do you want me to do that? You seem to be having trouble- - No this thing is blocking everything. Can I do that for you? - Yes, not now, I just need that. I was very disappointed. Who's it going to be- Oh, those ones. I thought you were talking about these guys. - This guy is this for the Greek salad, which has the special ingredient, that nobody has- She's very nice. She's very sweet. She's very smiley. I don't know where she comes from. She's very mysterious. No, she comes from Russia. - About three pounds of tears we shed on that- On that flight. But I remember- I will never forget the moment that I was in the plane over Los Angeles. That overwhelming feeling of home. There's no place like it, it's home. L.A. is where my heart is, where my life is. It's my body and soul, I'm here. That's where I'm thinking about. I love living in that town, I love the people. I know it's very rare, usually people say, oh my God, L.A. people, they're so empty. They're not empty, they are like, they're- They're welcoming, they're generous. I think maybe also because I'm a restaurateur and I'm a easy talking to, and I'm easy at friendship, it's at my advantage. But the friendship I made in the United States are in Los Angeles. It's a lot of fun to be part of this community. It's a big community of Los Angeles. I like my job because many, many of the time, I'm here. I'm part of the community. I know all the community. And that's very exciting to me to be part of society, you know, it's something I really like. Five four three two one! Happy new year! The restaurant was full. Not every day, of course, but most of the time people were enjoying, customer was happy. People coming having fun, live music on weekends, piano bat Thursdays, getting more employees, getting more- more presence, getting more following. The restaurant was thriving and- And just turning like a beautiful oiled machine, you know, like like a beautiful clock. And obviously the pandemic killed everything. New alarm bells ringing tonight on the Corona virus outbreak in this country. As the number of dead rises, more confirmed cases tonight in New York and Los Angeles. Tonight in Los Angeles, a local emergency as six new Corona virus cases have been confirmed, and now a startling warning shaking the region of 10 million people. What we do know, experts say, is Corona virus can spread between people within six feet of each other. - And whenever possible, try to keep six feet between you and other people that you don't know at large events. The entire state of California ordered to stay at home. That's 40 million people. The global death toll has now topped 10,000, almost 250,000 cases have been recorded. I think it's going to take a lot of time. I think a lot of optimistical businessmen wants to make money, think that in a few months, it's going to be ended. Since the beginning I heard that, that, oh, like, don't worry, by this summer is going to be ended. And it's not going to be ended for a while. Oh, wow. Oh, no. I was not expecting that. It's kind of logical. All the animation of a farmer market with all the stands on both sides. It's so exciting. 10 pounds of tomato, 10 pounds of cucumber. Half and half like the cream, thank you. I voila, I like that, perfect. I should have bring my weed, I could have smoked a joint while I'm waiting, it would have been so perfect. I think not enough people come here and enjoy the produce of- of locality. That's how we are supposed to be. Different size. Not all the same. Look at the cucumber. You see? Aw, there's even a bit of dirt in there. It's so cute! Do you need a receipt, chap? Yes, of course I need a receipt, please. It smells good. Yeah, so it's, eye, smell, mouth, hears, and of course touch. You have to smell it. You have to drink it. You have to taste it. Have a lovely day, guys, thank you, amigo. Look at that, beautiful. Thank you, sir, have a lovely day. - You too, and, yeah, let us know how they are. - Oh yeah, definitely. Pork and flowers. Oh my God this is so exciting- You have to buy flower if you buy pork, just so you know. - Hey buddy. - Hello. - How you doing? - Good, man. Can I get six pounds of bell paper please? - Sure. - Thank you. No tomatoes today? No, no tomatoes today. That's pretty good I think, it should be pretty good. You said six pounds there? - Yeah, six pounds. Hmm. - Pretty good, huh? - Not bad. They are delicious. - Low acidic acid, yeah. They're going to get better Once we get some more humid- We've got everything we need. Chef's going to be happy. Happy chef, happy life. Cedric started and started to do some mixed plates, charcuterie, and cheese. - We were going to open the menu a little bit to make it bigger and try to start to play again a little bit. - To make a little menu, to try to develop, to try to have more pickup orders, more to go. Okay, I got it. Order. Branzino sausage. Here you go, my dear. - All right. - I voila. - I got it, I got it. - You got it? - Yeah. - Bon appetit. And let me put that right here. It's okay, honey, do you want me to- Let me take it to your car, please. I don't care. Behind you. I voila. Merci, bonsoir a. Merci beaucoup. Merci. I transform all my wine list as a retail place, like, you know, retail price, and started to send emails and put that on Instagram. We open. We've, of course, some respect, only 60% of occupation, separation in between plexiglass, separation in between every table, blue plexiglass in wood. But we were like to make it nice, to make it beautiful. And, and two weeks after we had to close again. Tonight, governor Gavin Newsom has a stark warning for Californians, with coronavirus numbers rising. The state's recovery may be at risk and that puts businesses at jeopardy of staying open. We are now effectively, rather effective today, requiring all counties to close their indoor activities. Their indoor operations. - And after we closing again, it was- It was, we were struggling even more. Hey guys, how are you doing? Stuck in, how are you? - No problemo. - Are you guys open? - For pickup only. Oh, it's pickup only? - Yeah, like, right now, we cannot have dine-in or anything, guys. Every restaurant? - Yeah. It's only dine out. You can only dine outside. Because it's only outside? - It's only outside and it's going to be like that for a while, I think, Sir. - And a lot of people were coming in all the time, picking up a to go order and asking if they can stay and eat inside the restaurant. I mean, every other person was asking that question. And I think Vincent just wanted to- Knowing that he cannot do that and it's not safe and it's not in compliance, Vincent kept saying no, obviously, but then I think he wanted to do something for his community, for the neighborhood, for his customers, his friends. Nobody's talking about opening or anything. So. We need to do something about it. If not, like I said, it's bankruptcy tomorrow. May the force be with you. I must quickly go back to the restaurant and get rid of that. We have a lot going on. - Voila, you said it. Huh? You said it. - We have a lot going on. - I said it? - Yeah, you said it. - Oh yeah. I love you. I love you more. Okay, basically call me if you need anything, okay? Ah, I feel like I'm opening the belly of a pork. Ready to do anything to try to save the business, look at me. Trying to plant some trees in an ally, behind the McDonald. Okay, no? When it's going to be windy, it's going to move all the time. So we need all this stuff to block all the way through, but I know what I'm going to do. Restaurant industry's already very hard. I strongly not recommend it. Unless you're in tech and you make millions of money just behind your computer doing nothing. And now, the pandemic made it impossible basically. Nothing like that is going to happen. Spare to put some art and stuff like that. It's a first try. Other staff are going to be- You see, like using the measure tape to see everything is at six feet from each other, try to respect all the rules and then go for it. Before we go, I just want us to do like, a little plan of the back area again together. So I know what I have to do tomorrow morning to try to- - Okay, you know what, there was one thing I was just thinking about. You know, like those are doors on that wall, right? Like the windows or something on there, like make something kind of cute out of- - Yeah, we can, but when we need to do something, then we- - Just, you screw it in. Go see how much a 24 foot piece of lumber is. Do they do 24 feet of lumber? They don't. They do. - You help me one day, I give you one case of wine? We'll figure it out, yeah, we'll figure it out. Trenten is a good friend of mine since I came into this country. He is very handy like I am, and he's a very good friend. I'm very grateful to have met such people in America, you know, and create so much friendship. - Do you have a 4x4x20 foot? The 4x4x12's- - Yeah? - They're $25 each. - Perfect. One, two, three, four, five, okay. Then we- One bracket on the wall, okay. And then we need-No, no, no. We will, we'll have these going across it, right? We have the thing, okay. And they're going to sit-Yeah. - We take one more parking space. I don't mind. Probably can do 1300 outside plus the to go. So we arrive around 2000. It's not enough, but it's a beginning. - Yeah? - Yeah. Voila, boom. Yeah. That's the-Last time you gave me a bigger one. If you want I can give you a bigger one- - No, if that's enough, I'm okay with it. Thank you, honey. Have a good day. Hey there, how are you doing? What do you want me to park? Okay buddy. Thank you man. Oh. Okay, I'm good to go. I just need a day off with my wife. I want to go to Point Dune. With a lot of wine and my wife and maybe some friends. It's not holding, we have a problem, Houston. No, I don't feel good at all. Voila. Finally got it, guys. On the road again, buckle up. It's a day to day, the future of Belle Vie. It's a day to day thinking, I don't know. I don't want to take chance of saying it's going to keep open, it's going to close. Right now, I'm doing my best every day to not to have to answer to that question yet. If I lose the restaurant, I lose my visa. If you lose your visa, you cannot stay here that's the ID. I lose my visa and my chef is also losing his papers. So in three weeks after you lose your E-2 visa, you lose the business. You have to go back to your country, basically. You're not welcome anymore. Even though if you work and pay taxes for like now four years, like, bye-bye, thank you. - Yeah, it's a very complex process to immigrate and to actually stay here, you have to take an oath and you're standing with about 2000 other immigrants. They have to put their hand up the same as you. I remember just crying for two and a half hours. I couldn't believe that I finally made it. It took me 12 years to become a citizen in this country. You constantly have that fear in the back of your head that you're not going to be able to stay here. And you had wasted so many years of your life, nothing. - The process of coming from France was difficult due to- That's why I had to open a restaurant so I can create my own business. - If Belle Vie is closing, I have two months to leave the country because my visa is-I'm under Belle Vie. Which is why if Belle Vie doesn't exist, I can't stay here. I have to go. I like to live here, for sure, better than, than Paris now. Yeah, I feel more free here. Do you have a girlfriend? - I do have a girlfriend that I met here, yeah. That would be a sad hand, but if it's happen, it's happen. You know. What's up? I'm in the back. I just wanted to say hi, are you busy? Yeah, no, no. I'm on my way, I went to buy some wood quickly. I'm on my way back right now. No no, it's okay, I'll see you at home. I see you at home, baby. I'm going to try to be finished in an hour and a half then we can go to Glendale. Okay, I did the application for Marlon- - And we need to do the one for me as well. - No, I did the SBA for- I'm gonna do the one for- PPP-that's the one I need to do for you. - And there's a fund from the city now. The city is doing new loans and stuff. I don't know so much about the new stuff. I'll check it out, okay? Okay. Hey, today we're getting our marriage done. Okay. Now being married, I'm going to be able to stay. And usually, I don't know. They've been closing all the offices for immigration due to COVID-19 and due to an extreme, new way of managing the country. And this is their new hoax, the coronavirus, you know that right? Corona virus. We'll do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country, we have no choice. - But let's not talk about politics together. So my next step is to have a working permit and a green card. And then she does want me to become a U.S. citizen, but it's going to take seven years from now to do that. And voila, you know, that's the next steps to take. Where's my Coca-Cola, baby? I put it in the glass. That's it, for me? Baby, I'm working in the sun, outside, all day woodworking. I need an entire Coca-Cola. - No you don't. - This is insulting. - It's too much sugar. He needs an American size. - Not yet. - I need a bigger Coca-Cola, I'm a man, baby. I'm 6.4, 200 pounds. - One has poison the other one doesn't. Okay I'll try two-Both of them then. Perfect. Yeah, let's do that. One. I voila. We're good. Boom. There's a 16 foot, are going to be long enough? We going fast, it's exciting. At least, instead of doing nothing at all, all day, you trying to do something, you know, to fight against adversity, you know. Instead of waiting for people to order food, we making it happen. And Sasha I need also the level. It's so heavy. You good? Thank you. That's 93 right there. Oh fuck. Oh my God. Well, yeah, I'm hoping this looks like a little cute canopy With some tables outside and to transform this very ugly part of Los Angeles. You know, we've got your McDonald's next door, the fucking nail salon, to make it cute, you know. Like you can have a good experience and be happy having dinner and be transported to Paris. Drew a structure and then some plans, add then some decor and music, some sexy French accent, and we good to go. A little Vincent. - Voila. Probably like 10 tables, if I don't have enough tables, we're going to have to see if it works and buy more tables I presume. I don't know how much I'm going to spend. And there's no lim- Yes, there's a limit, but like we need to anyway. I have nothing else to do right now, guys. Okay. We do them all the same size, we cut them and we just Is it perfect? In your face. Boom, okay. Okay. Can I get a kiss before you go? Just like that, perfect. If the city doesn't like what I'm doing right now well, we're closing after that. 'Cause this is illegal, what we're doing, by the way. Bonjour. Gazebo. A gazebo, cute. So it's that or bankruptcy, but it's cute, no? What do you think? Ah, happy hour, a little glass of rose. Perfect, merci madam. Ciao. Oh my God, man, it's looking like something. I'm going to have a break. I'm more this kind of person, you know, like- I don't like weapons, I don't like war, I don't like politics, I don't like destruction, but I like building stuff. It's very fulfilling, you know? I think it's, yeah, it's fulfilling. As in, I think every human should be- Can be fulfilled just by building something instead of trying to destruct and make the most money they can make in the world. Me, look. I'm broke as hell, I'm in debt, and I'm super happy. Easy, Sasha, a beer for the gentlemen, please. I build like a structure in the back of the restaurant, probably for like 800 bucks. I would have paid a contractor for probably like, $10,000 to do the same work. I think we did a great job of trying to do something, trying to react of this crazy situation. - Now we're going to open the back, the patio, and people are going to start coming again. They feel like, they feel at Belle Vie, but outside, you know, and I'm sure Vincent is going to make it super pretty. Hey, business is starting, man. - How long did it take you? A day and a half. So which one? Oh, so this, this is an aioli with mushroom and parsley. You have your mask on the floor. Behind your chair. Really not your- And I love it guy, thank you. Not bad huh? For a small business. Belle Vie, bonsoir? Me, no, I'm trying to do stuff. Do another patio that I built myself and a lot of other stuff like that. And we're going to make it work. No no. Bonjour. Put it down, okay, now you can pull it. Sasha, careful, heavy man. Oh no. See like how hard it is to bring out and back in every day. Full carom marble table with cast iron on the bottom. It's kind of heavy. That's why I don't go to the gym, I have a restaurant Never carry this by yourself, man. Something that's heavy, you call me. - This is not heavy. I don't care. - It's not heavy, no. Don't take that totally apart, but you know, it's nice. It's going to be tough to bring it in. Was it difficult to- From the honor to get the permit, and the city? - I didn't ask. That's the thing I learned in America, is that you don't ask. You do, and then you ask for forgiveness, that's what they told me in the U.S. - Yeah, the saying is, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. - Voila, thank you. Number one, what the landlord is going to say, the landlord is going to say, take it off. Okay, I don't make money, so like- What I give you the key back? Then, the city, they want us to do stuff outside now. Now it feels way more Parisian because you can bring your dog. Exactly, it's better. I will never forget. Just seeing people come into the restaurant. To see the amount of happiness that it brought them to walk back into Belle Vie, into Stevenson's face, and to hear about his adventures over the last month and a half. That was an incredible side for me to see. And there are people who come in every single day, whether they pick up an order to go or just to pick up a bottle of wine and every single one of them just as- says the same thing, like, thank God you're back. Thank God you're back. Just it's- It's been very flattering to see that my husband was missed so much. Fantastic, have a wonderful night. Thank you, guys, thank you, brother. I'm very happy about what I did because you have a lot of regular clients that is the first time they come to the restaurant for the last four months. So it's very rewardful, because I see all my- All my community that I created, you know. A small restaurant is a center of a community, is a center of a neighborhood. At the prehistoric time we started socializing. Why? Because we were cold, so we did a fire. And everybody sits around the fire. And then we say like, oh my God, if we put some meat on the fire, that's so good. And we're starting exchanging, doing like shadows and stuff like that. You know, starting socializing. We need to socialize. So the COVID-19 is going to block us for a few years. And I'm sure it's a few years, but after, for our industry, it's going to go back to normal. Because people need it. We're talking about the future of humanity. In a week or something like that, we're going to get some customers, send an email. They going to come by, you know, a few. We're going to do a sort of opening. Give a bit of food, a bit of drink, and they all going to come and put some drawing, a message about 2020, a year that I don't know what you feel to be, you know. It can be good for people, it can be bad for people, but that's where we got to do. We wanted to take elements from the inside that make it special and bring it outside so that you could get kind of a piece of what you once had in there. People who have visited the restaurant and love it can come by and make their mark, fill in a frame, or right a quote or something. Just to, so it's like an ongoing community piece. Okay guys, it's already ready. I'm sorry. A lot of people answered to the leaving some words for 2020, but they're leaving words of love, it's pretty cool. You have to say it's 2020, what's happening, you know. What's up, you know? Okay, dokey, guacamole. Here you go, honey.. Okay, cool. Yeah, it's a happy, you know, like. People like to do that. And you see like this, a lot of people just feel artistic. Look at them, a cute little couple having a glass of wine. Look, bell, V, that's funny. People love it. People are very excited about what we're doing. People are having a lot of fun. It's just, it's eight tables instead of 20. Financially, it's not a very feasible plan because the amount of tables that we can- We can place in the back is very limited. The restaurant has to work at, you know, 70, 80% full, for you to kind of started making money, you know. That's how you do your business plan and calculations. So like getting full at 25%, 30% doesn't make enough money. We need to do at least 25 to 3000, hundred every day, five days a week to be afloat. And we're far from there, and we're far from getting there. French food is also not like pizza, pasta. You know, it's not like something you can order and get delivered. So it's not, I guess, I shouldn't be French. I should be more like, Italian, or Chinese or Japanese, you know, to have like a more bigger to go and delivery possibility of business. Oh yes, like, let's do a, small business administration loan, and give them money. We don't want money. We want to be able to open so we can employ people and this people can also make money. If there's a pandemic, the first people who will be careful about all the legislation you have to do, you're six feet apart, all that stuff, is going to be small businesses. Why? Because all big businesses, an corporation, the owner is not here. The owner is behind an office or the owner is shout orders and be on the office. I just want more money. And the people that are working there is just fucking manager who doesn't care. - You know, to just come and take their salary and go home. When you work for big corporation like that, you just come to work on time, take your break on time. It's hard, you know, it depends. I used to work for Gordon Ramsey in Versailles, which is a big corporation, in a big hotel. It's still hard but when you go home, you're just like, that's it. You tried to forget about it. And that this thing, when you work for a small business like that, you have to be that kind of available all the time. It's like your baby. You have to take care of him, like all the time. - And people are saying like, ha ha, we're going to reopen in three months, and everybody's going to go out. No, not everybody's going to go out. People are freaked out. It's going to be very hard for small- Mom and Paps restaurant to survive. Nearly one in six restaurants is closed either long-term or permanently due to the pandemic. That figure represents about a hundred thousand restaurants. The food service industry lost 165 billion in revenue from March to July. California restaurants appear to be fairing even worse with one in three restaurants telling the California restaurant association that they will either close permanently or downsize by closing some locations. - Four more billion of money they did, Amazon. So like some people are very happy about this pandemic and oh, what a chance it's the most rich people in the world that are happy about that. Rich people don't care. Everybody's playing at wall street with the money and they all making money. And us, so we're struggling. I don't know, there should be a cap or something. You know like, okay, you're $3 billion, congratulation, you have a golden plate, you're part of member of society. And all the rest of the money goes to education and helping people. We trying to have the same thing everywhere, instead of having local restaurants and local farmers to make our food and to get our food, you know, like a community. Look at all these people that need money anywhere. All the people in the street that needs help. If you're pulling people through the bottom, you cannot rise. And right now I don't see anything rising. I'm seeing everything going down, but the corporation are making more money every day. I'm not- I'm not a research person, I'm not a political expert, but what I see is that it's not working and that we're not doing anything to go somewhere. Find another solution, another way to live together, so we can live in symbion with each other and planet earth. I know a lot of people that are very rich and very sad because you cannot buy happiness. You can just buy stuff that is going to give you like, a little inch of happiness. Anyway, I just think happiness is something that, you know, you have to learn how to find it. You know, it's something you have to find. You live an elevated life of love and- And research of knowledge and sharing. You know. We need to try to live in your community and do something nice. Oh, how are you doing? You okay? Yeah. - I voila, I'm getting a Christmas tree. Okay. Hello, how are you? Welcome welcome, how can I help you today? - I want a beautiful Christmas tree for a beautiful house. All right, come on in. Fir, no? Oh, Fir, yes okay. This is a Douglas Fir. - Okay, perfect then. Douglas. You got it, man. Can I take off my mask to smell it? - Ah, yeah, you can go for it, I'll step away. - Okay, cool, perfect, can you put it on the roof of my truck over there? Absolutely. - And I have some tenders to attach it. How's your day so far? Yeah, Good living the dream, I guess, you know. I voila. There you go. - Gonna put it right up here? Yeah. - All right, sorry, I'm trying to get on- Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Perfect. Thank you for your help, brother. Thank you very much. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, happy holidays. And I wish you the best in your restaurant during these COVID times. Oh yeah, I mean, it's dead. I think if the restaurant industry doesn't work for me, I could definitely be Santa. With big pleasure. And my beard is starting to be white already. Oh, oh. I voila, we made it. I'm very happy about my tree. I've been waiting for it. Christmas is like, it's the day in the world where you have the most love. You know there's not another day in the whole year where like you you have so many people giving to each other, having dinner together, try to help each other. I think love should rule the world and not fear, like it is today. You know. We've been drived by money and fear for the last, I don't know, thousands and thousands of years. And we might feel like we're done with COVID-19, but COVID-19 isn't done with us. - Could LA county be headed toward a wide-scale lockdown with even more restrictions? LA county set to shut down all dining at restaurants, bars, and breweries this week. Both indoor and outdoor dining is now shut down in the county. - Well that's right, outdoor dining now has to stop. And it's devastating news for restaurants after the owner spent $5,000 to build that outdoor patio that you see right there. - They say they've taken all the necessary precautions. They dealt with one shutdown, then no dining in, and now are facing the threat of a second shutdown. This all after they spent tens of thousands of dollars on PPE. - Everything I own is being taken away from me and they set up a movie company right next to my outdoor patio. Because of recent LA county health orders, Marsden was forced to shut down her outdoor dining patio, which she says she spent close to 80 grand building and making COVID compliant. Under the county's guidelines, video and music production is deemed essential. Many production crews also test employees frequently, but Marsden says this isn't about the entertainment industry. She feels restaurants are being unfairly targeted by county health orders. - So yeah, the decision has been made. We're closing. Being closed, totally, there's no survival possible. Okay, I'm going to go bankrupt. I'm losing everything. I'm tired of fighting. It's been- Last week I got super sick just because of a nervous breakdown because you know what, I'm holding on. I'm holding on, I'm working 12 hours a day, 15 hours a day, finding solution, stressing up and stuff like that. And it's inside me, it doesn't get out. And you know, I don't want to regret something, that I didn't fight for my business and my restaurant, but also what I just learned is that, you know, being also a good business owner is to know how to get out. To make money, I have to be open inside. This is the only way. The last seven months hasn't been, I've been losing money every day. I'm probably around like $400,000 of debt. We touch a point of no return. By next week I empty, then I'm gonna file for bankruptcy. And then I'm going to put it on Instagram, Facebook, and email all the customers to say that we're closing, you know, a little announcement. My lawyer for the bankruptcy said like, oh, like, you're so poor you don't own anything, that you can probably save the furniture of the restaurant. Like. In my misery, I have some kind of happiness, you know, it's kind of funny I think. Taking my art and my copper pans and a few lamps and that's it, you know, there's- There's nothing else to be taken it's- Yeah, so many souvenirs, so much happiness, so much stuff shared with customers and meet so many people. And I got a lot of experience into American restaurant industry, I guess. It was a piece of shit and I imagined happen as the little gem of the neighborhood. This is the first guitar of one of my best friends who played many times here. So I cannot leave that guitar here, I mean. There was no live music in the neighborhood. No live music in the neighborhood. This is me and my best friend when we were young and stupid. Oh my God, this is so depressing. I have to take him now, he's so cute. So, everything's going to be empty like that. It's going to be- You know, if you look at a photo of the restaurant at the beginning and at the restaurant today, it evolved so much, you know, like- It was just like maybe one picture and two, three. It was not the whole wall. So everything, piece by piece, you know, started. So it was a living wall, kind of, you know, changing all the time, new art, and new stuff, new paintings. Customers are bringing me paintings. Putting-starting over to zero, back to zero. This is a very kind customer. He's a accountant, but he loves painting and he loves Paris. I'm sad for the community more than I'm sad for myself, actually. This is also the- My- The mother of my friend does that. She- It's a rose and she put like, polyurethane on it to immortalize the rose. Oh, I can't leave any of my records here because it's the only thing I own, my records. Je pars habiter a Los Angeles. And so it's kind of very meaningful to me. Because I'm going to live in Los Angeles. Cool think I found in an estate sale, how to speak French. This was a employee of mine who drove me behind my bar. This, is the best sex music you can have. In the world, okay? Serge Gainsbourge, Melody Nelson, okay. I'm going to take him for sure, man. This is my friend. We have spent so many nights together drinking, singing. Bada bing, bada boom. That's my grandpa, Papu again. This is of course, as usual, my grandpa uh-huh. Telendos is the island where we're from, and this, look at this bad-ass olive tree and the goats sounds beautiful and delicious. That's my grandpa, that's his restaurant, the bar and everything. And that's Vicki who died a year ago. And was his waitress for like 30 years or so. Also, all the copper pans are from my grandfather. So I can't leave my grandfather's stuff. Nicely compacted. Ah-huh. So, some recipe book from a collection that I have already with a lot of very famous French chef, used to cost 180 Francs. Jacques Prévert Paroles, is my favorite poet. He's a French poet, it's very- He's the only French poet who can do like kind of happy poesie. It's amazing. Les Secrets de la Mère Brazier 400 recipe from-Huh? What's in there? Oh, it's really chocolate. No way. More chocolate. Do you want more chocolate? - Okay. - Okay. This is the good one, it's like, with orange inside, no? Then we have some-Oh-la-la. Look at that. We have some dry salami from South of France made by a butcher, illegally imported. Thank you, once again. Aa what is that? I don't know, it's always- It depends-it's somewhat. Sometimes it's random stuff. Oh. I don't think it's for me. Oh my God, I think- I think this is for my wife. It's one, every three months like that. This, we're going to eat it, this, we're going to eat it, and this we're going to read it. Hello? Hello? - Ciao. He can't sleep, he's dreaming of having a restaurant every night. So he doesn't have enough employees. Like, so it's a normal life of a restaurateur, he's dreaming it every night. So he can put him to sleep, 90 years old, nice, no? You say like I have to change jobs, I should stop restaurant industry, it's a slavery job, I will never be rested, I will always be slave of my business, but you know, I'm like him, that's what I love. Dear patrons and friends, Belle Vie adventures are touching to an end. On December 20th, 2020, Belle Vie closed after a day of to go order. The door shut down in silence. Nobody talked about it in the news, and with none of you around. As we know, a restaurant is to be full to make money. And we don't see restaurants reopening at 75% inside very soon without being pessimists. I tried with my team, everything in my power in the last nine months to spend less and propose maximum of offer, to go myself to the farmer's market, washing all the laundry, doing the marketing, emailing everybody, delivering, and many others. The destiny of our small businesses have been pushed to a point of no return. I'm not closing by choice or because my business is not efficient. It's more because politics decided so. But like a wise man said the dining table is adorn as an altar to celebrate the cult of friendship. So my friends, as long as you're around a table, please, commemorate disbelief, and who knows, maybe I'll be serving you again. Thank you. That was a good one. Voila. I voila. I just did what I knew I had to do. Organizing a service, you know, from six to 9:00 PM, live music, people dancing, people having fun, people enjoying- It's the people, you know, it's the people that makes the restaurant. This is- Yeah, man. This is difficult. I still have to take the books, the cooking books. Still have to take a few lamps the arts and then that's it, you know, and, junga boogie. I'm gonna take some wine as well, I'm gonna drink it. In my sad- Drown my sadness into wine from France and other regions. Anyway. So that's it. This fucking COVID is everywhere. I would like to stay to be on this and do something else than Belle Vie, if I can, but obviously it's not easy with the visa situation and the situation now- Now with COVID-19 nobody is hiring a chef in a restaurant because they are all closed, you know. Who's gonna hire a chef now for a restaurant, I don't know. There's so many family here who use private chef, but even for those that I need, I need a- Another visa to be able to stay and- And that's not going to be easy. I have to be fast because as soon as Belle Vie's officially closed, I don't have too much time to stay here. It's better not to fight anymore because it costs money to fight and- And just remember the good things. And look for something else, now. I like to have like a basil, growing her, in the middle of winter here. I have to start again. This is- Everything is from last year when I moved here, I stopped planting seed and everything. And like I said, I had a lot, but like sit and show didn't walk and stuff like that. I have to- that's what's left. So I have to start again for next summer, you know. I tried everything. Me, I don't see business coming back in the next year or more. The dining, the dining. The dining inside, have fun and wine. And oh my God, that girl is cute, let's go talk to that girl at the bar. So. I mean. It's terrible, I don't know what to say. I know it's- How you doing? You okay? Good, how are you? Well, it's depressing, man. They're taking the coffee machine away? Yeah man, but don't worry. I'm going to continue to work with them. Okay. But it was not mine. So I'd rather call them before I do the bankruptcy and au revoir. - See you brother. - I love you, man. - I love you. - I love you, too. Give me a hug, too. Okay. Yeah, we all suffering, man. It's a big mess for all of us. - Very unfortunate. Somebody who will buy- I know, I mean, I just don't know what to say. Oh, it's okay, don't worry, man. The future is ours. This is super heavy. Full of copper and all that stuff. That's it. This is the end. The only end my friend. Okay, go. And that's it, you know. I've been trying to call my lawyer a few times already. Didn't call me back so we can file for bankruptcy. It's sad. It's sad, now you feel it, you know, emptying everything. It's sad, like, you know, because I know like a year ago, like we were killing it. No, there's- I'm not going to say any goodbye. You know, I lost a lot of people in my life, you know? And, I never say goodbye because you know, it's always in your heart. You know, you always think about the people, you know. It's my first baby, my first restaurant. I hope not my last one. I hope very much not my last one, because what happened to me, I didn't deserve it. Like- So many other people- It's, Belle Vie is going to continue because Belle Vie, it's a model. It's a state of mind. It's a beautiful life. Life is beautiful. But business is not finished, restaurants are not going to die. People are always going to want to go outside for a drink and socialize, you know, because that's why we in society, we create community, we socializing, we need socializing together, we need to talk. We need to talk to people, they need to be listened. They will find- We need to be listened. We want to be listened. We want to exist. That's what we want, we screaming every day, I want to exist. Everybody, you know. I'll still be happy. I still have my kitchen and my table outside to receive all my friend and to get drunk with them around a beautiful meal. To-do-do. Hi, good afternoon. This is Christina from Carnegie law group, how can I help you? - Hey Christina, I would like to talk to Ryan. Ryan, may I ask who's calling, please? - Oh, my name is Vincent Samarco. - Oh, hi Mr. - Samarco. I would like to file for bankruptcy. Hello! Hello, my friend. - Champagne. Where's the boy? Okay, my brother. Okay. When you cook with a book, you follow the recipe, but you also interpret it, you know. Like with your imagination. Like when you read a book or when you look at a movie. When you look at a movie, you just seeing the imagination of the director, but when you read a book, you imagine, so when you cook from a book, you imagine. - Same thing. - Same thing. We finished the first bottle already? Voila, champagne. You know like, the end of the world filmed movie, pandemic. Yeah. It is kind of nice and liberating, you know. If you would, Just pose for the camera and take a picture And we'll be done. Okay. I'm going to take a picture of you then. Because that's the idea you know. It's perfect because then you go into my new project. My new project is going to be to take photos of my friends, An other job. So your my friend and you're working right now. So I'm going to try to take portrait. We don't have enough light, so I'm not sure we're going to have a good picture. Luckily, I took one just before- I voila. I got your soul. - Boom. - Boom. Forever and ever. Thank you so much. Thank you.
