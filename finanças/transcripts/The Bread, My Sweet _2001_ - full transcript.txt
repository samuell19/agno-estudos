I mean, she's got six months left, tops, and can you imagine the wedding we could plan in six months? Stop it. Look, you're an adventurer, right? I mean, shit you go to the jungle, and you take care of people because they need it. And I know you know that every once in a while, you have to do something that's outrageous and bizarre. You have to, because it follows its own logic. It makes its own sense. And this is one of those times. You and I both know that you don't need a husband. But your mother would die happy if she knew that we were married. You know, she could plan it. She could imagine grandchildren. It would be a huge lie. Would you tell her? I wouldn't. I think I'm going to throw up. Imagine--imagine the things she could think of, planning this. She could think of everything but dying. She could help me choose my wedding gown. Exactly. That's something we can give her. Here. Here. Oh. It was my grandmother's. It's beautiful, but I can't--I can't take this. This is for your real wife. You'll be the only wife I have. I can't. Please. Marry me. And stay married to me for as long as your mother lives. Okay. What? Okay? Yeah. But... you have to ask for my hand, and you have to give me the ring in front of my mother. You have to give it to me in front of my mother. Okay, yeah. All right, okay. Promise? I promise. [chuckles] Holy shit. [laughs] Thank you. It was your idea. Here's to you. Hey! Turn that down. Listen. Where you been? I got in late. What time did you get here? Pino? I got work to do. Leave me alone. 3:00. So let me ask you boys a question. How do you feel about wearing hand-tailored tuxedos to the wedding? Man, you are nuts. I didn't even need to bring out the nuts. I had pistachios too. I was going to give her the whole "tough nut to crack" bullshit. Didn't have to use it. You improvised the pitch? Yeah, I told her about Mom. Now I gotta ask Massimo for his permission. This is too little. You know, like this is too small. I mean, who would agree to this? Is she some kind of freak or something? What are you talking about, Eddie? I do deals, man. Let me tell you something. It's like my entire professional career has been training for this one perfect merger. It's like the only deal I've ever done that's worth a God damn. Domie, what's wrong with Bella? What do you mean? Well, she's not hungry. I mean, she loves to eat and cook, and now she's not hungry. But you got the right idea there, buddy: smaller pies. You think so, Domie? Hey, who wants to be best man, huh? Me. Oh, no, please, please pick me. You know what? The hell with it. The both of you are my best man. What if Massimo says no? (Eddie) Domie will show him his nuts. I'll go like this. (Pino) Put 'em away. No! No! Rose, you almost saw my nuts! Hey! Here. What are these? Bones of the dead. Oh, right. They make them in Italy on All Saints' Day. Right. Mmm, good. It's kind of morbid, though. Well, not really. It's meant to remind us that life is like a cookie. You know, it's fragile, and it's sweet, and that we should-- you know, we're going to die soon, so we should live well. Why did you quit your job? My job was to fire people, and I hated it. And I knew that eventually, I would probably sell the bakery and fire Pino. Yeah, Pino's like Mom. They make the rest of us look like gaping whores. Uh, okay. It says here that you went to law school. And you quit the violin after six years of private lessons. Really? I sucked. Did you suck at law? No. I graduated with honors, passed the bar. And then I blew it all off to go into the Peace Corps. Why? I hated it. Good? Mmm, yeah. So... what kind of Italian are you? What do you mean? Where do my people come from? No, I mean, did you speak it in the home? Do you bury saints upside down in the garden? Do you believe in the malocchio? And to what degree? We were Spaghetti-O Italians. We ate it on weekends and lived in the suburbs. So you just love the whole Italian thing. Oh, I just think that the world is so hard on people, you know, and that we've become so mean and-- I like the food. Oh, my God, I can't. This is insane. Six months, and you're out. I promise, okay? And look, in two weeks, we'll be dating a month. And people figure you can fall in love in a month, right? I was talking about the cookie. Oh. Tell me about the Peace Corps. Quit. Five years ago I got discouraged. Two years ago I got depressed. And a month ago I lost my mind, which made me susceptible to your insanity. What made you lose your mind? I felt... I feel disconnected. I needed to be by my mom. And I hated that, but... Then I gave in to it. It's like falling into the city. I used to think That this was what I wanted, but... I'm so disconnected up here. The smell of the bakery, uh, Your mom's kitchen. The strip. That's what I want. And down there, Pino is king. [laughs] And I like that. You know, I'm saying things out loud I never even thought of. Hm. I uh, quit the Peace Corps two years ago. And I've been selling uh... Junk rip-off art to tourists. Because I didn't believe. Because I've quit everything I've started. Everything. And I don't know why. I could give you reasons, but... They wouldn't be the real reasons. I'm a quitter. Heh. You're so gentle with him. He's the dude. He breaks my heart. You know, he, he still gives Eddie piggy-back rides. Some people would think he's a burden. He's not. You're right. He is the dude. Hey, you uh, you want to go out after we get married? Um.... Maybe. She's spying on us. Really? Don't look. Don't look. I wasn't going to look. Uh... performance? Maybe. [laughs] Sorry. I'm sorry. Wuss. [laughter] Ow! (Bella) Mia dolce. You have good time? Yeah, you were right about him, Mama. He's a piece of bread. Good in every way. I think it's better you look in my eyes. You like this one? [laughs] What do you think? Don't matter what I think. I think it's better you look in my eyes, Mama. I don't want you see my eyes on such a beautiful night. Go to bed. Dream of that good young man. Then share your happiness with me in the morning. Buonanotte, Mama. Oh baby, me like! [cackles] No... Yes! Come on... Hey! You make the mess! [grunts] Massimo. What? I want to ask Lucca to marry me. Okay for me. You ask Bella. That's all you have to say? Me no say nothing. Me know Bella sick. W-we'll do it as fast as we can. Thank you. You make Bella happy. Hey, this is good. Shit, my wine's better than yours. Your wine's shit. Okay for you, but me no like donkey piss. Oh Christ, I'm stuck with you for the rest of my life, Aren't I? Me stuck with you, jack-off. You look at my cards? No. Who goes? You go. There, alright? Cheater. [laughs] (Massimo) Bella! [speaking Italian] Dom here. Ah, mio pane. Ask! What? Ask what? What? I'd like to ask Lucca to marry me. Is that okay? She love you? I love her. I think it's better you look in my eyes. I want to marry your daughter, Bella. I can see in your eyes you do. You do! Ask! That's it! Well, she needs to say yes. Oh, dear God. I don't know what she say. I don't think she ever marry any man. Well, I'd like to do it tomorrow, and I'd like you to be there. I make dinner. Well, it's got to be a surprise. Oh, I hope it's not you gonna be surprised. I don't get happy about nothing until that girl say what she got say. And that's it. Pino. You take me church? Okay. Bella, you okay? Sure, sure. I got pray for a while; that's all. I kill that girl if she don't marry that jack-off. Shut up, Massimo. Yeah, shut up, Massimo. Up yours. You going to be changing my diaper, jack-off! Wait for me! (Bella) You remember we get fresh snails one night, and they climb to the ceiling before we cook them, huh? I remember. Climb to the ceiling. [laughs] You know, in my town, we cook octopus. It's a funny creature, eh? It almost something else. But it know. You hold it over the pot, and it climb your arm. Holds on tight to life. Do you want a lot of rosemary on this? Mm-hmm. Give to me now. American men don't care if girls cook good. No, I think they care what a girl gonna do in bed most, and that's it. You think? Mm. You go in his bed? No, Mom. Good. I don't got kill him. You go in bed with anybody else? Mom. I only go in bed with your daddy. Maybe I should go in bed with more. Mom! Bad! What is that? [laughter] So if men are only interested in the bedroom, how come we're doing all this for Dom and his brothers? He take you out for four weeks. I can't give him lousy sandwich now. No, I got to give him pretty dinner. Show him how lucky he is to date the best girl in America. Come; leave that food. Go get dressed. It's better you don't look like a goat herder's wife tonight. Why? Just is. And that's it. Okay. Bella. Mwah! [knock at door] [laughs mischievously] [people talking] Hey. Hi. You look beautiful. I can't do this. Listen to me. Look, it-- It's like a pistachio. You know, the nut? They're very difficult to open, but once you do-- 67 times, I've gone back and forth with this. I keep changing my mind. Listen to me. Listen to me. This time, the impulsive thing's the right thing. Don't quit. I'm a quitter. Big Q. You can quit when it's over. When it's over? Don't kiss! Shut up, Massimo. (Pino) Look at this table. Bella, you gonna eat too? I feel good. Now we say grace. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Bless us, O Lord, and these, Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ, our Lord. Amen. (all) Amen. Uh, before we start eating... I have to ask Lucca a question. I know that we've only known each other for a few short weeks, but I've never been more sure of anything in my life than I am of my love for you. (Pino) Oh, Domie's in love. (Dominic) That's right, Pino. Remember what we talked about, our big secret? (Pino) Tuxedos. I told Eddie and Pino that they could wear hand-tailored tuxedos to the church if you'd agree to be my wife. Your wife. Will you marry me? Yes, I'll marry you. I'll be your wife. Dear God, she say yes. Yes, Mama, I said yes. [shrieks] That's it! [laughter] (Bella) We're gonna have a wedding! We gonna have a wedding! Oh, let's get out the cans, huh? Yeah. We make toast. (Lucca) No, wait. Wait. Wait for Mama. (Bella) No, I here. I come. Go ahead. Me no like weddings. Me no like church. Me like Domie. And Lucca e una testa dura, but me like. Okay for me to get married. Make babies. Bella! Come out here. Here I am, Massimo. I got money like King Farouk. Thank you. Make babies for your mommy and me. Make happiness for you. That's all!
