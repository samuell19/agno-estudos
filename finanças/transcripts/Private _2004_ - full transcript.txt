So you want to leave the house? -Yes. I can't take another night like that. Have you forgotten us? Samia, I hate this too. Then why aren't we leaving? Mama, dad also thinks we shouldn't let ourselves be chased away. Quiet. I'm scared. -I'm scared too. I don't want to become a refugee. Being a refugee... is the same as being nothing. To be or not to be. That's the question. To be or not to be. We'll stay here. I prefer the kids over your books, you know. It's a matter of principles. End of story. Let her go. She'll understand. -I'll talk to her. My turn. -Mine. Calm down. What's going on? Karim wants to use the bathroom first. -I was here first. Karim, you were first yesterday. She always does that. -Calm down, sweetheart. Forgiving is golden. Isn't it, Karim? Yousef, what are you doing? My homework. Can't you see? -Yes I can. But you always wait until the very last moment. You'll never learn like that. Why don't you bother the others? Because the others get better grades than you. Put that away and get ready to leave. Good morning. -Good morning. Is there no sugar in this? -Two spoonfuls. I have to go. We're having a teacher's meeting. OK. Karim, hurry up. They're waiting for you downstairs. Hurry up, honey. -Bye. Come on, Karim. Are you coming? Samia? Zena... -You scared me. Are you alright? -Yes, thank god. Let's go upstairs. What was wrong yesterday? We were worried about you. If only you knew. We were scared and it was dark. We heard gunfire but we didn't know why. There was a gunfight between Israelis and Palestinians. They said they were defending the Israelis... that live in the settlement. Liars. -The whole family was terrified. May Allah curse the day they arrived here. I don't really understand Mohammad. Clearly his principles are more important than our children. If only all men were more like him. Finally someone to show them we've really had enough. You'll pay for that. Believe me. So you were scared but they stayed outside. They won't be back then. Don't worry. May Allah bless you. -Amen. It's late. I have to go. Dad, I don't want to go to Germany. Too many universities. Why don't you take that chance? Other people dream of that. -So let them go. Mariam. Why are you being so stubborn? You've got amazing grades. You could live with your aunt and study medicine like you wanted. And return afterwards. Discussion closed. I'm going to a friend. -Fine. Yousef... don't bother your sister with your math. Let me have a look. OK. Bye. -Be back before dark. Mama, I don't want to go to Germany. First dad says To be or not to be, and then I have to go. Why? Your father's right. You should go. There's no future for you here. But I want to stay here and fight together with you. Can you talk to him and let me stay? Don't you know how hard he is to me? I feel like I'm the only one who's scared. But I still love him. What's he trying to prove? He's right. He wants to stay here and fight. Do you know what it means to go into war? You won't be able to do your laundry. Your father has his own reasons. If you want to be like him you'll listen and leave. Papa, does one say Elephant like this? Yes, but with an E. E-LE-PHANT. Great. Can I read your books when I'm grown up? Of course. If you try hard enough nothing is impossible. Thank you. Will you go to mama now? I have some more work to do. Have a nice week. Jamal. Mama, wait for us for dinner. Mama? Can I sleep in your bed? I'm afraid of the shadows. I'm scared. -Don't be, sweetheart. The shadows aren't even real. Will they be back tonight? No. But if they do come back I'll teach them a lesson. Deal? Now go back to sleep. Go back to sleep. Good night. Sleep tight. Mama? -Yes, honey? Nothing. Sweet dreams. Jamal, if they come back they'll kill us all. There's someone outside. Did you hear that? -It's only the wind blowing. Are you mad at me? We were made for each other. Say it. Say we were meant to be together, Samia. Like never before. -Stop it. Don't you see what's happening to us? I asked you to be with me. You're so beautiful. That's enough, Mohammad. Calm down, calm down. We won't hurt you. Don't be... how do I say this? Don't be afraid. No violence. Come here. Let us out. Let us out. I want to talk to you. Don't be afraid. I'll be back. After you. -No, you go. Do you want to leave this house? -No. Good. As of today this house belong to the Israelian army. I'll divide it into three areas. Area A is your living room. This will be your new house. After sundown you and your family will go in there... You will lock the door and will stay inside until morning. Area B is this part of the house. You can come here only if we say so. Area C will be upstairs. You'll not be allowed to go there for any reason. If I catch anyone trying to enter area C... or to climb out of a window I will punish them. This is for your family's safety. Don't play any games with me. Is that understood? Are you finished? -Yes. Can I go upstairs now to get some clothes? Be my guest. Papa, what did they say? They said we can stay here. They just want the top floor. We'll stay down here. Our new neighbours don't want us to go upstairs. So don't you ever go there. Understood? Understood? We'll sleep in the living room until they leave. Karim, get ready for school. Don't be afraid. They ruined our house. What were those pigs looking for? What were you looking for, dogs? We're not killers like you. That's enough. Enough. But look. Yes, I'm not blind. But screaming won't help us. Papa's crazy. I don't want to stay here. The soldiers will kill us. -We'll make them leave. How? They're armed. Do you want to get killed? Whatever they want. Papa's right. I'm willing to fight this battle. I don't want to stay here. Don't be afraid. If Allah wants, it'll all be OK. Just wait and see. I don't even dare to be alone in the house with them. Please take me with you. Samia my dear, if you leave today... you will be running away forever. I don't want our children to think we're frightened. Samia... You're a brave woman. I never thought you'd do this. Have faith in Allah. OK? Deal? Samia, Samia... Ssh. Keep it down. What's wrong? -The soldiers are upstairs. Hey, come here. Show me your ID. Your ID. Why are you here? -She's my friend. Quiet. I'm talking to her. Why are you here? -Samia is my friend. Where do you live? -Here. Where? -Here. In the village. -The village? Did you come alone? Yes. -Did you come alone? How did you come here? -What? How did you come here? -I walked. Did someone bring you here? Did you speak to anybody before you came here? Why are you here? I err... err, Samia. Clothing. For work? -Yes, work. So is it work or a visit? Work, work. Look, work. Any you didn't talk to anyone? -No. Listen to me. This house is occupied. I'm asking you to go and never come back. It's better for you. Hurry. You're real fighters. Don't be afraid. Allah is great. The price is becoming too high to pay. We'll die anyway. Better die with honour. Please go. -Alright. Bye. Yousef, Jamal and me will make the greenhouse. Feel like helping us? No, not right now. Is something wrong? -No, I just don't feel like it. Yousef, what are you afraid of? I'm not afraid. We all are. Even those soldiers upstairs. Maybe even more than us. No, they're not afraid. This is our house. Are you sure you don't want to help? Yes, I'd rather stay here. Fine. As you wish. If they break it down again I'll kill them. If they demolish it we'll just build it again. And if the break it down, We’ll build it again. Until they get fed up with it. I can't study like this. Mariam, what are they saying? I don't know, Karim. I don't understand Hebrew. Karim. Papa? What's going on. Jamal? What happened? My children are still outside. Let me see my children. Is Yousef there? Jamal? Karim? -He's with me, papa. Mariam? Where's Nada? Samia, where's Nada? What have you done? Open the door. -Open the door. Nada. Nada, sit close to the door. Come here. Don't be afraid. Stay close. Can you see the light? Look at the light. Don't be afraid, Nada. I'm close. Nada, are you OK? Nada. You were scared but I was close. I never left you alone. Do you want to stay home with mama today? Nada. Why aren't you sleeping? Open the door please. Please open the door. Is anybody there? Use the window. -No we won't. But the soldiers are gone. -Sit down. No one leaves through the window. What are you doing? -The soldiers are gone. You should've left the wire alone. They could come back. And they'll shut out Nada again. Sit down. Come on. Nobody moves. Sit down. Papa, they've left. Did you find something? Take what you need and go back downstairs. Papa, why do we have to? They could be back soon. The living room is safe. Why? They're gone. They could be back any time. -I want to go to my room. I'll never let them chase me away again. Get a suitcase and go downstairs. Why? -Because I say so. Why aren't we fighting them? We are fighting by staying here. We're fighting without weapons. Do you call this fighting, papa? Being locked in a room? Look at your family. Look at Nada. We have to fight. I'm no coward. I'm going to fight back. Cowards are people who use force as their only weapon. They like the smell of blood. They think violence and arrogance are the only means. An eye for an eye, A tooth for a tooth. Tooth for a tooth? You don't even know how to bite. Allah blesses those who know their limits. Do as I say. I'll wait downstairs so you won't be late for school. Karim, I've put your things here. This is your place from now on. We're not moving. Keep your heads down and don't be scared. Stay down. She's coming with us. Why? -Get up. Leave my daughter alone! Leave my daughter alone. Fuck you. Let go. Quick, go. You stay inside. Stay inside. Open the window. What did I tell you? Ofer, what did I tell you? His family's watching. -Shut up. This is none of your business. So stay out of it. Why don't you leave this house? Leave him alone. -Shut up. What did I tell you? Are you happy now? Are you happy now? Next time I'll kill you. Understand? You may surf to these sites: Islam GAHAD from Palestine SAHADA die for Palestine Yousef... You can't keep watching TV forever. Yousef. -Mama, I don't want to stay here. No one can visit me and I'm not a fighter. Like they say in school: what's so good about this house? Rashid's father allowed me to stay with them for a while. Is that what you want? I'd love to. Please help me. Eial. Yes? What are you doing? I'm playing flute. -Yeah? Great. So who's on guard? It wasn't my turn. -Then whose was it? I don't know. Maybe Ariel. Put on your bulletproof vest. -But I'm not on guard. Do you know where you are? -Of course. So where are you? In a house in Arabia. In the occupied zone. Correct. Do you know what's out there? It's crawling with terrorists. They'll kill you as soon as they get the chance. Were you going to fight them with your flute? Can't I play my flute? -Shut up and get on guard. Do you always have to piss him off? Me? He's the one that's always scared.... of being shot through the windows. Why am I on guard? What am I doing here? Calm down, stop talking crap. -You think I'm talking crap? It may be bullshit to you, But it's important to me. Are you aware of what we're doing? -I don't care. I'm just scared that this guy could be the end of us. You know what I'm going to do? Fire into a tree a couple of times. Pop, pop. Have you got a cigarette? I quit smoking. -I will. Really? Be careful not to light your flute. Didn't you leave anything for me? Nada... how's your English? Did you learn some new words? Let's hear a few. Where are Jamal and Karim? Yousef... How was the math homework I helped you with? It's because of him that I forgot my tables. Is there any tea? Get your books. And we'll do your homework. Can I have a napkin? Papa, I want to talk to you. -Of course. First get your books. I talked to Rashid's father. -I know what you want to ask. Forget it. Get your books. I can't study like this. -You couldn't study before. This time you're getting away easy. Time to get into the living room. You're getting away easy. Time to go to our jail. We shouldn't forget prophet Mohammed. Allah bless him. Shall we sleep... or tell each other stories? There once was a boy called Amir. Mama, I have to go to the toilet. Hold it for a while. -But I have to go. Mama, I've got to go. -Wait a little while, honey. Papa, I really have to go. -Wait a minute. Papa, I have to go now. Papa, I want to go now. I have to go. Jamal, what are you doing? Have him open the door. -Wait, Nada. Don't touch the door. -Do you want her to wet her pants? Do you want him killed? Beats having to live like this. -Nonsense. Don't touch that door. No one come near that bloody door. Sit down. Papa, I have to go. Wait a little bit. Just a little bit. Papa, I have to go now. Good night. I can't stand this any longer. Don't look at me like that. Why don't you understand? Look at the children. I hardly recognize them. Look at them. Yousef, Karim, and Nada. If we give up now and leave... we would make the biggest mistake of our lives. The children would never forgive us. They'd hate us for it. They'd hate themselves. And the Israelis. If only I could be like you. But I'm not. I can't force you to stay. Do whatever you want but I'm staying here. Alone if I have to. Jamal, have you set up irrigation? Yes. -Then let's do the roof. I have to go to town. Take care of the others. I'll be back before dark. Mama, I'm going to study. -Mariam. Did you bake those cookies? -Yes. Really? They're delicious. I'm in papa's study. Want another cookie, Mariam? -Yes. One more. I made them. Is that your art corner? Time for art? Do you want mine? -Won't you eat it? You really don’t want it? -No thanks. Why don't you eat it? -I think it's disgusting. Is it disgusting? -What did you think? The French pâté par excellence. Something like Foie Gras with Vichy sauce. It looks like... Well, you know. And it tastes like... steak... in red wine. Eial. It wasn't me. Karim... What's wrong? Why are you crying? What happened, Karim? It's because you're bad too. Me? Why? Papa says we're not allowed to go upstairs. Or they'll kill us. -No they won't. I'll tell papa. -No Karim, don't. But they'll kill you. -Who? The people upstairs? Why are they locking us up? -Because they're cowards. Don't be afraid. Why are you afraid? You know, the one that's sleeping in your bed... is called Dan. He's a fatty. It's just funny. Why is that funny? Because he's fat and everybody laughs at him. Who's sleeping in your room? The one who plays the flute. His name's... Eial. What did they say? To me? They speak English with me. How do they speak English? Just English. Are you sure they won't kill us? Yes, Absolutely. -Let's tell mama. No sweetheart, you can't tell anyone. It's our little secret, OK? Do you promise? Are you going to put the buttons back on my pants? Don't you see I'm busy? -You promised. What's wrong? Makabi Tel Aviv is nothing without Avi Nimni. Nonsense. He's not much of a man. You don't know what you're talking about. He's a pro soccer player. -He's the best we've got. Come on, Come on. Again. Come on. Look, 10,000 men in yellow. -Look at that. What a beauty. -What a shot. Goal! A brilliant shot. Calm down. -What's up your ass? Hush, or Ofer will come. -We've scored. 85th minute. -By Nimni. We'll be champions for sure now. What's going on? What are you doing? -Nothing. Having fun? Didn't you allow them to watch TV? Listen, this is the last time. We have to do our duty. Is that clear? But you said... -Our duty! You told me to get the TV. He really did tell me. You shouldn't have followed me. They don't want us there. -Tell me what happened. Nothing. He sent everyone to their post and let me go. Weren't you afraid of them? -Should I be? He can shoot all night. Did Dan talk about me? Dan? Hang on. Let me think. He asked me if you speak English. Who's the other guy? His name's err... Ariel. And the others laugh at him... for combing his hair and looking in the mirror. Like a girl? -Yeah, like a girl. Will you please stop following me? Deal? Want to go inside? Why aren't you leaving the house? Why would I? It's my home. Why don't you leave my home? Tell me when to open the tap. I will. I'm finishing the greenhouse. Want to join me? No, papa. Take your time. Wait for me, papa. -I'll wait downstairs. Mohammad, telephone. Eial. Yes? I've got a message from base camp. Tonight we'll be going to Tarmit, Raffah. Make sure everyone takes their stuff. Look around the house to see if we didn't forget anything. That's it. Are we the only ones going to Tarmit? Can't we go home first? Not likely. I am well aware... I know that you're disappointed. But that's life when you're in the army. I don't like this system either. Never knowing what's next. Going from place to place, from house to house. New people every time. I don't like that. I don't like that at all. I'm sorry... that it had to come to this. I know. -Good. I have to... I mean, if we're leaving I have to... check my bulletproof vest. Good idea when we're changing locations. Let's see. What's the matter? Hello. Shalom. Can't sleep? Papa? What's wrong, Mariam? I think I finally understand now. Good night. This house is occupied by the Israelian army. You're not allowed to go upstairs. Downstairs is your domain. It has been for a couple of days. -Shut up. My men and I just arrived today.
