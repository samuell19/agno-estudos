Come on. Honestly, I'm just sick of listening to your lies. Will you just listen to what I'm sayin'? I heard what you said, Quint. But Donna told me everything you're sayin' and everythin' you're gonna say. Damn. What? Something touched my hand. What're you doing, Quint? Just hold on a second. Quint. What the... Quint. You haven't been listenin' to a word I been sayin', now have you? You know that crazy girl means nothin' to me. Yeah, well... You just have to have a little more faith in me, is all. I guess I do. It's tight, but I'm getting through. Better you than me. Hey, I heard that. So, um, how's the ammonia levels, Doc? .098. Pay dirt, partner. Looks like a medium roost. Antrozous Pallidus, I think. I'm gonna try to get in. Now, if it gets too tight, you need to turn around and come back 'cause you do not wanna rely on me getting' your ass back up here. Whatever happened to sendin' a camera in there anyway? Hey, come on, Jimmy, you know I prefer the hands-on approach, right? Would you do me a favor? What's that? Remind me to lay off the cheesecake. Honey, you're talkin' to a brother. You know I don't mind a little extra weight, especially if it's in the right place. About five meters. Mostly mothers and young. All right, you might lose me in a minute. Damn, Sheila, you know I hate when that happens. That's all right, though. I got 911 programmed in on the cell. Hey, Jimmy, if you hate bats and caves so much, what the hell are you doin' with me anyway? For one, I ain't gonna lie, you kind of cute. And two, I like 'em, but, like, at a distance, a real distance, like on Wild Kingdom. And that's why you're down there and I'm up here. What the hell? Jimmy. There's some kind of... Jimmy! Jimmy! What the hell is this? All the dust! Ah! Who are you? Why are you landing that thing here? I'm Dr. Tobe Hodge. The CDC in Atlanta. Center for disease control? Hey, I never touched that girl. Dr. Casper, we need your help. Immediately. There's a plane waiting to fly us to Texas. Wait a second. Hold on a minute. Look, you're the best in your field, so we came directly to you. That's Dr. Alexander McCabe. He'll be accompanying us. I don't mean to pry, but what in the hell is this all about? There's a biological emergency. What kind of biological emergency? Bats, Dr. Casper. Bats. Sheriff Kimsey? Dr. Hodge? Yeah. Appreciate you all comin'. Uh, we have some gear. Yeah, I can see that. You must pack a lot of clout there, Doctor. Well, the CDC considers this assignment to be of singular importance. Good. Well, hell. Let's get to it then. So, ma'am, you're a doctor, now, of what exactly? Wildlife Zoology, specialty in Chiroptera. Uh-huh. Bats, Sheriff. I work with bats. Bats. Uh-huh. So, does that make you a Batologist? No. It makes me a wildlife zoologist with a specialty in Chiroptera. Uh-huh. To be honest with you folks, never seen anything like this before. We'll take over the forensic work now, Doctor. If that's all right with you? Hell, yes. Take over. I never did care too much for the sight of blood myself. It's a damn shame. There's some folks around town think some kids might've done this. Some satanic cult ritual thing or some other such nonsense. Uh... I'm starting with the male cadaver. Incision just below the temporomandibular joint at the neck extends in depth all the way to the hypoglossus muscle. I'm sure that jugular incision was the initial point of contact. They went for the lethal attack. Hey, Jimmy, I'd imagine nobody'd mind if you wanted to step outside and keep old Doc Swanbeck company. Yeah. That's a good idea, Sheriff. You guys just... You just keep doin' what you're doin'. The external anterior jugulars have been severed down to the common carotid on the right side of the median. Sheila, I'm gonna need your confirmation now. By just looking at the neck wounds, this one here by the ear, I'd say we have a bite diameter of four centimeters and a circumference of, say, 13 centimeters. The Pteropodidae family. This is impossible. These bats only feed on fruit and nectar. This can't be. Excuse me, ma'am? This must be some kind of sick hoax. Well, unfortunately, we're fairly certain that this is not a hoax. Wait a second. Are you sayin' some kind of bat did this? I'm afraid so, Sheriff. Well, then, there is something very wrong here, gentlemen, because this sort of thing is not supposed to happen. What's going on here? What is it you aren't telling me? Though the total number of attacks may be higher, we've only been able to confirm these five for certain. Yesterday was the first human encounter that we know of. I'd say it was a hell of a lot more than just an encounter, Doctor. All the attacks were similar and occurred here in western Texas. All in the past six days. Impossible. Dr. Casper? Bats do not kill people! Period! There must be some other explanation. One that has absolutely nothing to do with bats and therefore, nothing to do with me. Ms. Casper. You're right, of course. But the bats that we're talking about, they're very, uh, special. Special? In what way? Exactly what are we talkin' about here, Doctor? Well, the two bats that escaped from my lab were brought from Indonesia. They're test subjects. The Pteropus Poliocephalus in question... Hold on a minute! These are flying foxes we're talking about? Oh, no. Yes. But those are among the most endangered species in the world. Not to mention the ugliest and largest bats you ever wanna meet. Let me get this straight. Are you tellin' me that you're responsible for the death of those two kids, Doctor? Is that it? Look, Dr. McCabe sought our assistance at the CDC as soon as the bats escaped. Now we're here to stop these things before they can kill or contaminate others. Contaminate? What were you guys experimenting with? Well, let's just say it was, uh, virus-based. I really can't discuss it, uh, any further. I'm sorry. So, um, we're here to help you find your infected guinea pigs, is that it? And destroy them, if need be. Oh, you can count on that. Look, I'll help you find them but I'm not gonna destroy them. And I'm not gonna let any of you destroy them either. Oh, don't worry. It won't go that far. I assure you. Bats can be anywhere in a 100-mile radius. That's their range. Of course they could also be in a barn, or underneath a bridge or in a sewer. Well, that's just dandy, but I figure we gotta get started somewhere. So if you had to pick one place to look, where might that be? Here. The attack happened here between the town and the national park. This would be the most likely corridor between the bat's roost and its food. This is Kimsey. Where? This is definitely not gonna look good in the mornin' paper. These killings weren't done by a single bat or even two. Our bats must be infecting other bats with the virus. Emmett! Amanda. This is Dr. Sheila Casper. Dr. Casper, this is Mayor Branson. Emmett, tell me what in heaven's name is goin' on here, would you? Well, as far as we can tell, we think this was done by some sort of bats. Bats. Yes, ma'am, that seems to be the case. Now I know it sounds crazy... The bats we're referring to are diseased. They're infected with some sort of virus. And we don't know much more yet but we hope to, soon. What am I supposed to tell the families? The town? That we got a bunch of rabid bats on the loose? Whatever you say, Amanda, you need to say it now, all right? Warn folks. Tell 'em to stay inside at night till this all blows over. Deputy Munn's gonna start puttin' some calls out. All right, Wesley? That's right. What we need to avoid right now is any sort of panic. Ma'am. Right. Oh, yeah, you can save that panickin' stuff for later. So, you mean TV, radio... Yeah, flyers. Whatever you gotta do, Wesley, just do it, you know. Get the word out. Right. I'm on it. Oh, and cancel that God damn football game tonight. They were gonna lose anyway. Yes, sir. Dr. Hodge, anything? Yeah, good news. Preliminary blood tests from the two teenagers suggests that any abnormalities infecting the bats is completely host-specific and can't be transferred in active form to humans. So, you're sayin' that the bats can only infect other bats. The virus was designed specifically not to be transmittable beyond the bats' own zoological order. Tell me, Dr. McCabe, what exactly did you do to them? I'm sorry, but again, I'm not allowed to say. Now, that's bullshit! Those things are killin' people in my town, and as far as I can tell, you're directly responsible for that! We need to know what we're dealing with here, Doctor. I'm kind of curious myself, now that you mention it. All right. I'll tell you, then. You let me know how I do. You've somehow increased their natural intelligence. Yes, and their ability to work together communally. Well, that's not so bad. We could all use a little dose of that. Then you made them aggressive. Now, that's bad. Finally, you made them carnivores. No, Dr. Casper, I made them omnivorous. Put my bats anywhere in the world and they will feed. But why would you do that? Because I'm a scientist. That's what we do. We make everything a little better. Bigger livestock, better crop yields. Millions of years of evolution. What arrogance to think that you could do better. Apparently, I have, Dr. Casper. Apparently, I have. You son of a bitch. Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't like anythin' movin' higher up the food chain than me. Period. Okay, look, our chief concern at the moment must be insuring that this disease is not allowed to spread to the bat population at large. 'Cause if their feeding habits are disrupted, well, you may as well just say "so long" to that nice little balance-of-nature thing we had going. Take a look at this. This is a bat migration schematic I've created. It traces migration, feeding patterns. I've entered the usual information climate, food sources, bat roost. Those dots, those are our bats. Now, once the temperature changes and they start freezin' their little bat asses, they'll migrate. Followin' their food to more temperate climates. By February, this colony would have reached Mexico City, San Antonio, and New Orleans, just in time for Mardi Gras. And if our bats infect other bats and those newly infected bats follow their usual patterns of migration... Show 'em, Jimmy. That, my friends, is six months from now. And it ain't gonna be pretty. 'Course my ass will be long gone by then. If we don't stop them soon, what happened to those kids is gonna happen all over the country. So, what do we do now? The only way to stop the spread of the contamination is to locate the roost And to annihilate every last infected bat. So, you reckon these things'll hold 'em, huh? Yeah. They're called mist nets. Feels like fishnet stocking to me. They're a little tougher than they look, Sheriff. Hey, Wesley, Jimmy, come in. Yes, sir. How y'all doin' over there? Jimmy and I are gettin' along like gangbusters, sir. We just hung a bunch of those damn net things. Yeah, they're called mist nets. Whatever, sir. They feel like fishnet stockings. How 'bout that? So, y'all keep your eyes open. Let me know if you see anything. Yes, sir. You'll be the first to know. Trust me. Yes, give me that information. Uh-huh. Right. Yeah, local law enforcement is adequate, but they're on a need-to-know basis. Same as the team. He's here. He's with me now. Fine. They're in the field. She's very competent. I was very impressed with her. Blood on the moon. Excuse me? My mama used to say when the moon was red, like it is tonight, that there was blood on the moon, meant somebody is gonna get killed. Sheriff, if you're tryin' to put me at ease, it's not working. Sorry about that. It's okay. If you don't mind me askin', what's that for? This? It's an ancient Chinese symbol for the bat. Chinese consider bats good luck. Harbingers of good fortune. Say, hey, what got you into bats in the first place? Well, when I was a little girl growin' up back in Ohio, we, uh, had a barn. Had some bats in it. Scared the hell out of me. Used to give me these horrific nightmares. Well, anyway, one night my dad finally dragged me out back and caught one of the bats. He explained to me all the good things bats do. Like pollinating rain forests, and eating insects, and what have you. And then he made me hold it. And I gotta tell you, it was the gentlest thing I'd every seen. Guess I've just been bat-crazy ever since. The thought of killing one goes against everything I've come to believe. Well, I tell you what. You catch one of those things tonight, I'll pet its belly for you. Hell, I might even take it out to dinner and a movie. Oh, God, there's too many. What do you mean? Come on, let's go! Come on! Come on! Hold that tight. Cover the vents! Any possible entrance! Hurry up! Well, that's all being taken care of, sir. But a-as we speak... Wesley, Jimmy, come in! We're gonna need some help down here. Son of a bitch! They're trying to get in! Jimmy here. What's goin' on? Jimmy, these things. They're not like any bats I've ever seen! They're trying to get into the truck. Where'd I put my damn keys? We're on our way. God! I can't find my damn keys! Oh, shit! They're trying to get into the engine! Whatever you do, Sheila, just try and stay calm. I ain't calm and I'm tellin' her to stay calm. Son of a bitch! Come on! Come on! Sheila, they're getting... They're getting' in! No! Get it off! Come on! No! Shit! Shit! Sheila? Do you hear me? Come in! Sheila, you hear me? Come in! Sheila! Clear it, Sheila! Clear it! Are you okay? Are you okay? Oh, shit. Use your gun or somethin'. Come on, now. Shoot at 'em! I'll hit Sheriff and Sheila. Well, just shoot over 'em! I mean, try to scare 'em off. Then again we could just hightail it out of here, now. Oh, God! All right, hold still. Let me take a look at you, here. - All right, hold on a sec. - Sheila! You okay? Are you all right? Yeah. I ain't never seen anything like that. Not ever. Hey. Sheila? Yeah? Looks like they left a little somethin' behind. Oh, God, Sheriff, don't move. Don't move! All right. Be careful now. Okay, one, two, three! That's why I leave that kind of stuff up to her. See? What'd I tell you? Ugly! All right, now, this might sting a little. Sheila, I been doin' some thinkin'. And what I figured out is this. This is fouled up! And I'm thinkin' about headin' to Antarctica right about now! Now, I checked into this. There's not one bat up there 'cause they hate the cold. Hey, Wes? WESLEY: Yeah. Get ahold of the mayor. Make sure everyone is inside and their houses are secure, all right? All right. Go on now, get on it. Oh, right. All right, that should do for now. Thanks. Holy shit. McCabe's bats. Sheriff, do you have your gun? In my hand. This might be a good time to use it. Now, you only have to clip their wings. Huh? Clip their wings? Would you shoot their damn heads off? And don't Miss. Damn! Hey, are you all right? Yeah, we're great. Nice timing. Thank God you got one of them. I need to study it immediately. We've got other plans for this one, Doctor. Catch your own. All right. Now, when I open the cage, I want you to reach in and grab him by the neck and wings. Are you crazy? Try to be gentle, but firm. Think I can handle that. I'm sure you can, Emmett. Okay, you ready? On three, gentlemen. One, two, three! God damn, this sucker's strong! Okay, easy. Sheriff, would you take his other wing, please? Please? Thank you. Oh, no, Jimmy, thank you. So, are you sure he's not gonna tear that bug out? No, it's injected under the skin where he can't reach it. Won't hurt him, though. Oh, well, that's a relief. We're in business, Sheila. I'm telling you this isn't going to work. I know what these things are capable of. You getting a clear fix, Jimmy? Crystal clear, baby. Great. Should be able to pinpoint the roost's entrance to within a few feet. I tell you somethin'. I lied. I ain't gonna pet this thing's belly. Don't let us down, sweetie. How's it trackin', Jimmy? Perfectly. Long as it keeps movin' away from me. No. Houston, we got a problem. We can capture another bat. Can't we? Just try again. That could take days. What in hell we gonna do now? Evacuate the town immediately. Order a comprehensive evacuation for 100 miles here to Mexico. And Hodge, we're gonna need more help. A lot more help. You can study it now, if you like. Sheila, I've just ordered reinforcements and they're gonna arrive in the morning. Effective immediately. The CDC is evacuating the town of Gallup, Texas. Good work, Hodge. Evacuation? Yeah, I think that's a good idea, Doc. 'Cause based on this new localized program, well, looks like all this time them damn things have been makin' their way directly towards town. But we might still have some time. * Your eyes are dark * Once we were hungry * Now we are full * These chains that bind us * Can't beat these chains * If love is shelter * Walk in the rain * You were my angel * Now, you are real Hey, Manny!

As far as I knew, they were. Sheriff, thank God. Amanda, what the hell are all these people doin' out? We've warned 'em six ways to Sunday! Nobody wants to believe it. Everybody in Texas thinks they know everythin' about everythin'. Oh, my God. What is it? They're coming. Their echolocation calls, it's their sonar. I can hear it. They're coming! Uh, shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. People, move off the streets! Everybody! SHEILA: Get inside! Get inside! Please, get inside right now! Come on now! Hurry up, everybody! Come on! Take cover! Take cover! Please! Everybody, get inside! Let's go. Go! Oh, God! You gotta get inside! Get into the theatre! Get inside! JIMMY: Move! Move! Get him inside! Close the doors! Hey, you all right? Get out of here.

Sheila, you all right? Sheila, Jimmy, y'all all right? He saved me. He saved... He saved my life. My God. I can't believe it. It's all right, honey. Anything you see, radio it in immediately. Wes? Ah, damn it, Wesley. Suit up! Excuse me, ma'am. Yes, sir. All right. We'll see what we can do. They're evacuatin' everybody now. Airstrip's closed down. They got roadblocks outside of town. Mexicans are tryin' to clear everybody out down to Jaco and Rosita. Jeez, Emmett. What're we gonna do now? I'm still workin' on that, Amanda. Come on. An old Texas custom. This evacuation covers the entire town, doesn't it? Yeah. No one's goin' in or out now. So tell me something. What in the hell are we still doin' here? Well, Jimmy, we asked 'em to let us stay. Say what? To aid in locating and destroying the bats. You gotta be pullin' my leg, 'cause this shit is not funny. They're only giving us 48 hours. Wait. Why am I the only one who doesn't know about this? 48 hours before they launch a full-on military air strike armed with hellfire missiles. They're gonna bomb every cave, cavern, dugout and foxhole in a 100-mile radius of Gallup. What? Are they crazy? They'll kill every living thing in Gallup county and not a single bat. That's right, and we cannot let them do that. Now, I begged them for this chance and... Well, they agreed but we're basically on our own. I tell you, I'm not gonna let 'em blow my town off the face of the earth without a fight. People got their homes here. Hell, they got their whole lives here. It's my job to make sure they got somethin' to come back to. The reality is we're sure to be quarantined for the next month, whether we stay or not. What? He's stayin', too? I created them. This will give me time to review my work and figure out what went wrong. Jimmy, we could really use your help. But I would understand if you don't wanna hang around. Well, let me tell you one thing. If another one of your bats looks at me, if his head starts movin' like this, or his eyes start goin' like this, like he might even look at me, I'm comin' for you. Does that mean you're gonna stay? Yeah, I'll stay. Somethin' called a Chroma B340. It's the newest thing in spy satellites. When the satellite passes over Texas, they're gonna center their infrared cameras on a 50-mile radius just south of Gallup. Give us a direct feed. Now, when the bats emerge from their roost, it's gonna be your turn, Sheila. See, the military, they, uh, wanna be as hands-off about this as possible. So you're gonna have to make the ID. You figure you can do that? I can try. This is our school. It's not as primitive as you might think for a one-horse town. But I figure we can fortify it as good as any. Let's hope so. All right, Jimmy, you can set up in here. It's the science room. All the computers are rigged with high-speed modems. See if you can't hook us up to Langley. We should secure the building before it gets dark. I heard that. What is that? That is Montserrat singin' Donizetti's Lucia. It's one of the real touchstones of the whole Bel Canto repertoire. Oh, you're an opera fan, Sheriff. I'm impressed. Don't tell anybody about my hidden vice. Around here, folks would run my ass out of town on a rail if they knew. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. You are a sick individual. Get out! There. We are now as secure as the god damn Alamo. Bad example there, Jimmy. Oh, right. You know, maybe we should hang up a few cloves of garlic around here or somethin'. What do you think? I got hooked up to the base. Once the satellite passes over they'll start sendin' us a stream of photos. That'll work. And once we find 'em, then what? Well, let's assume they're all living in the same roost. Given their communal behavior, I'd say that's likely. Poison? Not an option. The most popular poison for bats is Chlorophacinone. Largely ineffective against them and highly lethal for humans. Believe me, I've checked into this a long time ago. Maybe if we try and trap 'em? Well, whatever we do, we're gonna have to make sure we get all of 'em. Why don't we just bomb the sons of bitches? No, no, no. An explosion would definitely scatter them and given the potential complexity of the roost system, it might not even kill all that many. This is like some kind of a nightmare. I mean, I'll never sleep again. Wait a minute. That's it. What? We'll put them to sleep. When the temperature drops below 40 degrees, bats begin to hibernate. But at 32, they'll freeze to death. Right, but how do we do it? Yeah, especially in the middle of a heat wave. All we need are cooling units powerful enough to freeze the roost. Well, all right. Jimmy, get on the horn to Langley. See what they can come up with. I'll check it out. Hey, Sheila? Seems to me, you're thinkin' about walking into that roost with a whole lot of those damn things hangin' right over your head. Uh, no, you see, bats are nocturnal. We go in there during the day and... Yeah, but those are normal bats you're talkin' about. I mean, these... I know. We don't have any other choice. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. All right, boys and girls, we are all set. They have something called the NGIC Industrial, a cooler that emits a combination of Freon, CO2 and pure oxygen at superhuman velocity. This babe could cover Cairo in icicles in three days. Good enough. Now, once we've located the roost, they said they'll do an airlift and drop-off at the entrance. But that's as far as they will go. They don't even wanna know about us. Right now, they're preparing for a bombing raid. All right, we're gonna need some special gear to go in. What? We're goin' into the roost? Mmm-hmm. All of us? Don't worry, Jimmy. You're gonna have to stay up top and monitor our progress, right? Yeah. Right. Maybe next time. 304. We are at drop zone. 304, commence drop. Sheriff, lift with your legs! Yeah, well, if I had legs like that, I might use 'em more often. I ordered the best body armor they had. You're gonna need it. This is all Kevlar, steel-reinforced. You don't say. The breathing gear is used mostly to protect us from the ammonia fumes. In the roost occupied by millions of bats, the ammonia from the guano can reach lethal levels. Guano? Bat shit. Oh, yeah. Right. Wonder how that one slipped out of my mental thesaurus. Sheriff, trust me, you don't wanna die chokin' on no bat shit fumes. That's it. Last page. This looks like them. Hey, Sheila, y'all need to take a look at this. Yeah. That's them, all right. Those are our bats. Oh, no, this can't be right. All right, this here is a mountainous area just northeast of the national park. No, no, we ruled that area out already. There are no caves there. Nothing. There's no way. Well, that's because they're not in a cave at all. They're in a mine. Now, the mine is right in here. It was recently shut down. It's not on any maps, but I'm tellin' you, it's huge and it's called the Black Rock Mines. Black rock mines. Are you certain? That's affirmative, Major. No, we're absolutely certain about that. Good work. We'll be there at dawn. All right. Sir, they've located the bats. We're clear to move in at 0600 hours. No, that's no longer an option. Who knows where they'll be then? We go in while they're out feeding. Sir, based on the nature of these creatures, I strongly suggest that we wait for daybreak. You don't need to tell me how dangerous they are, Major. The government has been working on this project for over a decade. McCabe was working in Weapons Development. Yes, Major, it was us. We started it and now we'll end it. Go, go. These are from an old geological survey. I figure the bats have to be here. No. No they're deeper. They would never allow themselves to be that vulnerable. Well, since this cavern's man-made, the trip down should be pretty easy. Provided, of course, there hasn't been too much internal collapse in the tunnels. How about other entrances? As far as I know, the entrance the bats are using is the only one this place has ever had. One entrance. Nice tunnel down, should be a piece of cake. No, it won't. They'll know you're there. They'll know what you're up to. They'll try and stop you. What are you talking about? They're always aware. That's how I designed them. To be perfect killing machines. - What? - You son of a bitch. They found us. How? How could they have found... Because I called them here. And now, we'll put an end to all this. They're takin' out the power. Those bats didn't escape from your lab, did they, McCabe? No. You let them go, didn't you? Very perceptive, Sheila. How could you? You knew what those things were capable of! Do you know how many people have died, McCabe? Huh? Do you even care? They simply need to be controlled! If you understood them the way that I do, you could control them! Then do it! Control them! You go on! Stop 'em right now! Why would I wanna do that? Bitch. They're gettin' in. Look out! Stay away from the windows! I'm firing up the generator! They're getting through here! Come on! Get out of here! Whoa, I hate this shit! Come on, work with daddy! Come on now. Shit! It's on now. Get back! Get back right now, Sheila! Get back! Get away from the window! Get out of here! Yeah! That's right! I got something for your asses now! Come on! Yeah! Burn, you flying rats! Burn! You done messed with the wrong brother this time! Come on! Burn! Yeah! Oh, shit! Come on! Work with me! Come on, baby! Work with me! Come on! Let's go! Now, come on! Come on! McCabe, come on back here now. Doctor, just come back inside slowly. Don't you see? They want me. They've come for me. Because I can control them! I made them that way. Come to me. No! Get off! Hey, hey, listen. They're gone. Because they got what they came for. Oh, my God. They tried to do it. They tried to go in during the night. Would you look at this shit? Damn! It's down there. What is? Refrigeration unit. It's a big one. Looks like they wired this whole damn place with explosives. To seal the mine. That seems to be the plan. Come in. Come in. Major Reid, this is Sheriff Emmett Kimsey. I'm here with Dr. Sheila Casper. We're at the Black Rock Mines. Major Reid here. Sheriff, right now there's an air campaign headed your way with instructions to bomb and gas that mine in exactly 62 minutes and counting. Now, I suggest you get out of there. Now. They can't do that. If they bomb that mine, the bats will scatter. Then no one's gonna be able to stop them. Major, I don't know if you know this, but your cooling unit is down there. It's in the cavern. Yes, Sheriff, unfortunately, those men were unable to turn it on. That was a failed mission. What? We're gonna have to go down there and turn it on. Major, if you can give us a little bit of time, we can turn this thing on for you. No, I will not halt this air strike! Do you understand? Now get the hell out of there and that is an order. Major, please, listen to me. We are right here, right now! We can turn this thing on! You just gotta give us a chance! Listen, I'm makin' the call. Now get out! Shit! All right, we got about an hour. An hour to get down there, turn on that cooling unit, and seal the entrances. 1-7-0. Hey, Sheila, look over there. Good. Just say the word, baby. I'm at your command. If there's any problem, you know what you have to do, right? What are you talkin' about? You're both gonna be up here with me by then. Look, you and I are the only ones who really know how bad this can be. Now, I need to know that you'll blow that entrance if you have to. Trust me, Sheila. It's not gonna come to that. But you'll do it? Yeah. You can count on me. What's that sayin', "Any day above ground is a good day"? I tell you though, when this is over, I'm gonna lay on the beach for, like, three years. Some place they've never heard of a bat. Fire up the blender, Jimmy. I'll bring the tequila. Two tunnels. There's only one on the map. Great. You gotta make a choice. To the right. See those over there? Those are possum bones. Possums don't live down here. I'd say one of our bats dragged 'em in here as sort of an in-flight snack. Very good, Sheriff. I'll make you a Chiropterologist yet. You all right? Are you all right? Yeah. Fine. What's with this water? It's guano. It's filled with parasites and insects that feed on it. Are you kiddin' me? I am not up to my chest in bat shit! I'm afraid you are, Sheriff. Whoo! Nasty. Is this what you call normal? I wouldn't call much of anything I've seen in the last few days normal. And I truly did not think it could get any worse. Wait a minute. If there's this much guano in here, then... Oh, Jesus! Welcome to ground zero, Sheriff. Oh, my God. I never would've believed it if I didn't see it. God, there must be millions of them. You folks need to be real quiet right about now. It's taken you, like, 15 minutes to descend. That means you have 30 minutes to fire up that cooling unit and get your asses back up top. What's the temperature down there? 52. It's better than we hoped. Just curious, but anybody have any idea how to work this thing? I know you're not askin' me. Let's just hope they remembered to gas it up, huh? That will be nice. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, hurry up. Losin' time. This shouldn't be too difficult. Looks like we're gonna need a key to complete this job. Oh, no. Shit! Damn it. I found one. Let's hope it's the right one. Jimmy, Jimmy, it's working! It's workin' like a dream. Ha! Bravo, as they say in the opera. Now, get your asses up here before the fat lady starts singin'. Roger, base. We're arming. I think we better keep moving. Oh, God! It's gone. No. They're just circling their prey. Jimmy, if we don't make it, you know what we discussed, right? You gotta blow that entrance. Yeah. Sure. Jimmy, we have no other choice. Yes, you do! You have seven minutes, Sheila! Come on! Emmett, I lost your video! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get out! Yeah! Yeah! Shoot it! Emmett! We gotta get out of here. Can you breathe okay now? Yeah. How much time, Jimmy? Four minutes! Come on! Initiating firebombing. Sheila, come on! We're not gonna make it! You will! Come on! Go, go! Commencing final approach. Come on! Go! Go! Blow the entrance! All right, all right, come on! You can make it! Now! Call 'em off! Major, call off your boys! We did it! We sealed the mine! Are you sure? We have to be absolutely certain. Am I certain? Is pig pork? Yes, I'm certain! Here you go, sir. What's the status? Major Reid. All right. We got satellite confirmation. Good work. Now get the hell out of there. Sheila, are you okay? Yeah. You? You all right? You okay? I'll live. You did it! Damn it! I told you, Sheila! Just hold that there. Okay, the temperature inside's droppin' fast. Our bats should be sound asleep. And their little bat asses frozen forever. Provided there are no other entrances. No, that's it. That's the only way in or out. Good job, guys. Jimmy. Honey, you stink. What's he talking about? I don't smell anything. I smell bat doo-doo. Well, before you get all precious, you know, you ought to take a look in a damn mirror. That ain't your best look, either. Come on, doo-doo! Comin'. Oh, it's about time for a cigar.
