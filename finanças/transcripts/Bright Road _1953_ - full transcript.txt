NOW, LET'S SEE... SUPPOSE WE BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING. "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD... AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD." NOW, WHO CAN TELL US WHO GOD IS? All: GOD IS OUR FATHER. OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN. VERY GOOD. NOW, WHY DID GOD MAKE US? SARAHLENE? HE MADE US TO SERVE HIM IN THIS WORLD AND TO BE HAPPY WITH HIM FOREVER IN THE NEXT WORLD. HOW DID GOD MAKE US? IN WHAT WAY DID HE MAKE US? MARY LOUISE? GOD CREATED US IN HIS IMAGE. WE'RE ALL CHILDREN OF GOD. VERY GOOD, MARY LOUISE. GOD CREATED US ALL IN HIS IMAGE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, C.T.? DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'. BUT YOU WERE THINKING SOMETHING, WEREN'T YOU? SUPPOSE YOU STAND UP AND TELL US HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS. CAN'T SEE HOW EVERYBODY LOOKS LIKE GOD WHEN SOME'S BLACK AND SOME'S WHITE. [THINKING] UH-OH. I WALKED RIGHT INTO THAT ONE, DIDN'T I? WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE ANSWER. I HOPE HE'LL UNDERSTAND IT. YES, C.T., GOD CREATED EVERYBODY IN HIS IMAGE, BLACK AND WHITE. HOW COME? WHAT COLOR IS GOD, ANYWAY? WELL, IT ISN'T A MATTER OF COLOR AT ALL. WHEN GOD MADE US IN HIS IMAGE, HE PUT A BIT OF HIMSELF IN EACH ONE OF US. HE LOVES US, JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER LOVE YOU. WE'RE ALL BROTHERS TOGETHER. IF WHITE PEOPLE AND BLACK PEOPLE ARE BROTHERS, HOW COME THEY DON'T ACT LIKE BROTHERS? [THINKING] OH, LORD, LET ME SAY THE RIGHT WORD JUST THIS ONCE. C.T., IT ISN'T GOD'S FAULT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T ACT LIKE BROTHERS. IT ISN'T AN EASY THING TO DO, BUT WE CAN LEARN BECAUSE GOD IS ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP US WHEN WE ASK HIM. Man: I NOTICE, FOR INSTANCE, THAT IN THE MATTER OF EXTRA SCHOOL LUNCHES, WE'RE SOMEWHAT OVER THE BUDGET, PARTICULARLY IN YOUR GRADE, MISS RICHARDS. LET'S GO OVER SOME OF THESE NAMES. WE'LL START WITH THE LAST ONE YOU ADDED--C.T. YOUNG. WHAT ABOUT HIM? C.T.? I HAD HIM LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT, BUT I NEVER PUT HIM ON THE LUNCH LIST. I REMEMBER THE BOY. HE'S DEFINITELY A BACKWARD CHILD. DOES THAT MAKE HIM ANY LESS HUNGRY? IT'S JUST NOT FAIR TO THE SCHOOL. IT'S A PITY WE CAN'T TRANSFER HIM SOMEWHERE. TRANSFER HIM? WHERE? YES, IT ISN'T AS IF WE HAD A SCHOOL FOR BACKWARD CHILDREN. IF WE DID, OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM WOULD BE A SIMPLE ONE. BUT, MR. WILLIAMS, I'M NOT SURE THIS IS A BACKWARD CHILD. HE MAY NOT BE A BACKWARD CHILD, MISS RICHARDS, BUT HE CERTAINLY ACTS LIKE ONE. MR. WILLIAMS, I KNOW I'M A NEW TEACHER, AND I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE, BUT THIS BOY, THIS C.T., WELL, I KNOW HE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ANYTHING WE DO OR SAY, BUT HE'S MY PUPIL NOW, AND IT'S UP TO ME TO WORK IT OUT. [BELL RINGS] I THINK WE CAN TAKE THIS UP LATER. WE'LL HAVE TO ADJOURN NOW, AND THANK YOU. HONEY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD TALK LIKE THAT. YOU SURE TOLD HIM. YOU WERE WONDERFUL. I DON'T FEEL SO WONDERFUL RIGHT NOW. Mr. Williams: MISS RICHARDS? YES, MR. WILLIAMS? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN TEACHING SCHOOL, MISS RICHARDS? THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR. DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT THE OTHERS MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT C.T.? MAYBE THEY ARE. I JUST DON'T KNOW YET. WELL, SINCE YOU FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT IT, I'LL KEEP C.T.'s NAME ON THE LUNCH LIST. OH, THANK YOU, MR. WILLIAMS. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS RICHARDS. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. WILLIAMS. SHE'S YOUNG. SHE'LL LEARN. I LIKE ENTHUSIASM IN A TEACHER.

ANSWER THIS ONE. 9 TIMES 9. WELL, C.T.? I'LL ASK C.T. TO REMAIN. THE REST OF YOU MAY TAKE THE USUAL RECESS. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] MAY I HAVE THAT PIECE OF PAPER YOU WERE WORKING ON? YOU REMEMBER--WHILE THE REST OF US WERE DOING ARITHMETIC. COME ON, LET ME HAVE IT RIGHT NOW. THAT'S NOT BAD. TELL ME, C.T., DID YOU HAVE ANY DRAWING LAST YEAR? A LITTLE. NOT MUCH. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN LEARN FROM BOOKS BESIDES ARITHMETIC. THERE, NOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? I LIKE MINE BETTER. YOURS IS VERY GOOD, BUT YOU COULD DO A LOT BETTER IF YOU HAD THE RIGHT BOOKS. YOU KNOW, WE ALL HAVE TO LEARN FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS MORE THAN WE DO, AND IT ALL HAS TO BE WRITTEN DOWN IN BOOKS SO THAT IT CAN BE PASSED ON TO THE REST OF US, SO THAT WE-- ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME, C.T.? NO, MA'AM, DON'T THINK I AM. Children: * 3 BLIND MICE * SEE HOW THEY RUN * SEE HOW THEY RUN * THEY ALL RAN AFTER THE FARMER'S WIFE * * SHE CUT OFF THEIR TAILS WITH A CARVING KNIFE * * DID EVER YOU SEE SUCH A SIGHT IN YOUR LIFE * * AS 3 BLIND MICE? ALL RIGHT, C.T., IF YOU JUST WON'T LISTEN, TAKE YOUR DRAWING AND GO ON OUT AND PLAY WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN. * SEE HOW THEY RUN DON'T WANT TO PLAY THAT GAME. I AIN'T NO MOUSE. VERY WELL, SUIT YOURSELF. WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SAID I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THAT GAME. DON'T WANT TO SING THAT SONG. IT'S A MEAN THING TO DO, CUT OFF A MOUSE'S TAIL. YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS FELT ABOUT THAT SONG, TOO. SURE ENOUGH? SURE ENOUGH. SURE ENOUGH!

THEY MAKE A LITTLE HONEY, I SELL IT. THAT'S WONDERFUL! IF YOU KEEP THAT UP, I'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU A "B," AT LEAST IN DRAWING. OH, BY THE WAY, C.T., WILL YOU HELP US WITH THE CHRISTMAS POSTER?

IS, BOY, IS. 3 TIMES 8 IS 24. 3 TIMES 8 ARE 24. 7 TIMES 2 IS 14. 7 TIMES 2 ARE 14. 4 TIMES 7 IS 28. [THINKING] SO THAT'S HOW IT IS. YOU WON'T DO THE ARITHMETIC FOR ME, BUT YOU WILL DO IT FOR ROGER. YOU KNOW, I OUGHT TO PUNISH YOU BOTH FOR THIS... BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL. C.T: 8 TIMES 6 IS 48. 8 TIMES 6 ARE 48. IS, BOY, IS. [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] [HORN HONKING] [DOG BARKING] NOW, JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE. BEFORE WE DISMISS FOR LUNCH, SARAHLENE HAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE. IT'S A CIRCUS! MAYBE IT'S A PARADE! BOY, OH, BOY, LET ME OUTTA HERE! IT'S ONLY A CALLIOPE, AND YOU CAN ALL LOOK AT IT DURING LUNCH HOUR. NOW, LISTEN, PLEASE, FOR JUST A MOMENT. SARAHLENE? MY FATHER HAS BOUGHT US ALL TICKETS FOR THE CIRCUS, AND MISS RICHARDS SAYS, SHE SAYS THE WHOLE SCHOOL IS GETTING OUT EARLY SO WE WON'T MISS A THING, NOT A THING. [BELL RINGING] YES, BOOKER? MISS RICHARDS, IS C.T. GOING WITH US, TOO? THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO C.T. BUT IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO, I'LL ARRANGE FOR SOMEONE TO STAY WITH HIM HERE. [THINKING] WELL, C.T., HOW LONG CAN YOU KEEP THIS UP? I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HURT, BUT PLEASE COME OUT OF YOUR SHELL. [HORN HONKS] TELL HER YOU'RE SORRY, C.T. NO. NEVER GONNA SAY I'M SORRY. BUT WHEN ARE YOU EVER GONNA SEE A CIRCUS AGAIN? WHO CARES ABOUT AN OLD CIRCUS? [HORN HONKS] GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON. WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING ON SPENDING YOUR VACATION? IN MOBILE. YOU DON'T SEEM VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. OH, YES, I AM. IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S... IT'S C.T. YES. IT SEEMS I'VE FAILED. I THOUGHT THAT MINE WOULD BE THE ONE CLASS IN WHICH HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND TWO YEARS. BE CAREFUL, JANE. A GOOD TEACHER LOVES THE CHILDREN IN HER CLASS, BUT SHE DOESN'T LET THEM BREAK HER HEART. SHE NEEDS HER HEART FOR NEXT SEMESTER. YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR HEART, BUT HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT LISTEN? [HUMMING LULLABY] * SLEEP * MY LITTLE ONE * SLEEP * MY PRETTY ONE * SLEEP [HUMMING] [BUZZING] [SCREAMING] C.T.: NO, NO! NO, NO, DON'T HIT THEM! THAT AIN'T THE WAY! DON'T HIT THEM! YOU GOT TO GET THE QUEEN, THE QUEEN! I'LL GET HER! NOW, YOU ALL STAY WHERE YOU ARE! [BUZZING] OK, QUEEN-- TELL THEM TO FOLLOW! TELL THEM TO FOLLOW! [BUZZING] GOOD DAY, SIR. C.T.? YES, SIR? I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD OF YOU, C.T. YOU ARE? YOU'LL FIND THE REST OF YOUR CLASS IN THE AUDITORIUM. OH, UH, COULD I LEAVE THIS FOR MISS RICHARDS IN OUR ROOM? CERTAINLY. GO AHEAD. C.T., THE OTHERS ARE IN THE AUDITORIUM. WHY, IS THAT YOUR CATERPILLAR? THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN DRAWING ALL WINTER? IT'S ALMOST READY TO BE A BUTTERFLY. C.T., HOW WONDERFUL! I WAS SAVING IT FOR TANYA. WOULD YOU LIKE IT, MISS RICHARDS? WHY, C.T., I'D LOVE IT. WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT IF I SHARED THIS WITH THE CLASS? SURE ENOUGH. FINE, YOU CALL THE CLASS AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THINGS HERE. OH, C.T.? YES, MISS RICHARDS? I NEVER SAID THANK YOU, DID I? IT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS RICHARDS. I NEVER SAID I WAS SORRY, EITHER. Jane: THINK OF IT-- LAST SEPTEMBER HE WAS JUST A LITTLE OLD CATERPILLAR, CRAWLING ALONG ON THE GROUND. NOW HE'S COMING AWAKE AFTER A LONG WINTER'S SLEEP. A BEAUTIFUL CHANGE IS TAKING PLACE. HE'S BEING BORN ALL OVER AGAIN. JUST AS YOU AND I WILL BE BORN AGAIN SOMEDAY. AND EVERYONE WE'VE EVER KNOWN OR LOVED. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE ANY MORE THAN THE CATERPILLAR DID. AND SO, WHEN THE BUTTERFLY SPREADS ITS WINGS AND FLIES AWAY, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY. FOR HERE TODAY WE HAVE A WONDERFUL PROMISE OF THINGS TO COME. Children: OOH! [EXCITED SHOUTS] YOU MUSTN'T! MR. WILLIAMS, C.T. HIT ME! C.T. WAS RIGHT, SARAHLENE. EVEN A BUTTERFLY MUST HAVE ITS FREEDOM. I HOPE YOU BOTH HAVE A PLEASANT VACATION. OH, MISS RICHARDS, YOU KNOW WHAT... WHAT, C.T.? I LOVE YOU.
