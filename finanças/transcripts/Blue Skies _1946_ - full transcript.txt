And now, the Burtain Phonograph Company brings you... led Potter and his 'Off-The-Record' program. 'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Jed Potter... 'once more in his anecdotage, so pull up a chair. 'As I promised, we're going to turn back some of the pages... 'of Irving Berlin's Album of Songs, 'songs, that like footnotes to history, reflect an epoch in American life. 'To most of us they bring back a multitude of memories. 'To me they bring back a story which I'm going to relate tonight. 'And for a very special reason. 'It's an unfinished story because the people in it are real, 'and real people have a way of leaving their stories unfinished. 'However, somewhere tonight... 'there is one person who may be able to give this story its proper ending. 'I hope she's listening. 'It all began early in that period of peace between two world wars. 'In one of the big shows on Broadway, there was an Irving Berlin song... 'called, A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody. 'Incidentally, this is the story of a pretty girl... a very pretty girl.' Is like a melody That haunts you night and day Just like the strain Of a haunting refrain She'll start upon a marathon And run around your brain Don't worry! Don't worry! Sorry, Joe. Last night, girls! Anything goes. Last night or no last night, those people paid for their tickets. Oh, c'mon, Mack. Mary! Mary! She will leave you And then come back... That's a gorgeous thing, Mack. No monkey business. No monkey business. That's what I said. Anybody that would... Gosh, you're clumsy. - Oh, I'm on! Hello. Don't forget, we're going out tonight. She will leave you again Say, you're good. - You're crazy! Come back again A pretty girl is just like a pretty tune Hear that? C'mon. Now you've arrived. - Oh, I'm scared to death. Mary, you play your cards right C'mon, take a bow. Mary? - Yes, Mack. Why didn't you tell me you're leaving the show, not going on the road? Did Jed Potter tell you that? He says you're going with him into the new Dillingham show. I'm sticking with this show. - Comin' up. Mr. Potter! - Ah, please call me Jed. Who gave you the right to say I'm leaving the show? Well, aren't you? - Jed. Don't you ever give up? - Not where you're concerned. I want to get you out of the chorus. You could be a lead in a Broadway show. You have talent. - Talent, hmm? You've got great possibilities, with a little coaching... In your apartment? - What? Well, Mary, what do you mean? I've heard all about it. Girls do talk, you know. Are you gonna believe them or me? - Them. Thanks for the offer, but I'm going on the road. Now, wait a minute! Mary, you're crazy! I'd give my right arm... to get an offer like that from Jed. - An arm wouldn't interest him. Bubbles? - Junior, what a surprise! It's all arranged. what? My man'll do your packing. You and I are going to Dillingham's party. No, Jed. Good night. I'll just have to drive you home then. Thanks. I can walk there faster. If you're in a hurry, we'll walk. Jed. On my word of honor, I swear I'll take you straight home... after one little drink. All right, one drink. Where? Oh, just any old place. Then you won't want me, Mr. Potter? That's a difficult choice, Jeffrey. Good night. Good evening, Mr. Potter. - Hello, Jim. Hello. How are you? Hi, Jed. - Hello, Johnny. I got your message and I held you a nice table for two. Oh, just any old place, hmm? - Well... Have I dropped somebody's hot potato in somebody else's lap? - You have. My first wrong move this evening. I hasten to rectify it. Jed, dear boy, what a delightful surprise having you drop in! So unexpected! Oh, what luck! Here's a table for two. Come along, will you please? How you making out? - Oh, great! Happy hangover, kiddies. - Thank you. Here we are. Johnny, this is - Waiter! - Where's the waiter? - It's novelty night. We're putting liquor in the drinks. I'll be back. Is he an old friend? We did a hitch in the army together. Charming, isn't he? Let's have a little service. I want a drink. Don't you think you've had enough? If I think I had enough, would I ask for more? You've got a good point. Hey, Tony! This gentleman would like a drink. - Number 12. - Number 12. The Frankenstein Special! Well, come on, make it snappy! - Shh. Quiet. You want to wake up the waiters? - Johnny? Ooh! Now, what was it you wanted? Oh! I wanted.. I wanna get out of here! Here, stay on your feet. You'll get a draw. Amazing, isn't it? That boy must be a relative of the bartender. Johnny, take a look at this girl. - Thank you. I like looking at her. Wouldn't you say there's a brain in that head? - I'll check. May I? I'd say in the back of those pretty blue eyes is an attractive brain. Thank you, sir. - I had the same impression. But we're wrong. She... - Do you mind if I speak for myself? Not just now, dear. I've offered to get her a spot in Dillingham's new show. She turned it down. - Ask him why he wants me in the show. I shall do that just for you. why do you want this young lady in the show? It's a chance to get her out of the chorus... Oh, I see... an interest in her career. That's nice. why are you rejecting Potter's offer? My mother told me never to take presents from strange men. Ah, her mother. Mary, Johnny's known me for years. Ask him if there's anything about me a girl could possibly distrust. Can I speak freely? I forgot to tell you. He has a fine, infantile sense of humor. Seriously, am I right? Of course you are. The customer always is. Mary, if you had one ounce of ambition... There's more than one kind of ambition. A woman can be ambitious to be famous or ambitious just to be a woman. Listen to who's talking about ambition! I, uh, don't ordinarily admit it, but this hillbilly and I were once in Vaudeville together. Shh. Not so loud. When we got a chance to play the Palace, he went to Louisville and played a honky-tonk instead. Do you know why he went? Because he wanted to see a horse. I'll thank you to speak more respectfully of Rosebud. Did he not win the Kentucky Derby and buy me my first nightclub? And at Belmont Park did he not take it away? That he did. I appear to be on. Couldn't sell you flapjacks, southern-fried chicken? No, thanks, friend. We dropped in for a drink. - I'd like some. You shall have some after I annoy the customers with a song. Will you stand by? I, uh, thought you were in a hurry. Hmm? Oh, I wasn't hungry then. Johnny Jones was a first-class private In the army last year Now he's back to business in his father's place Sunday night I saw him with a smiling face when I asked him why he felt so happy Johnny chuckled with glee He winked his eye and made this reply Something wonderful's happened to me I got the guy who used to be my captain workin' for me He wanted work so I made him a clerk In my father's beanery And by and by I'm gonna have him wrapped in work up to his brow I make him open the office every morning at 8:00 He comes around about four hours late It's great! Everything comes to those who wait I've got my captain working for me now He's not worth what I have to pay him Oh, I'll never complain I agreed to give him fifty dollars per It's worth twice as much to hear him call me sir Hit it! Sir! While I sit in my cozy office He's outside working hard Out in the hall at my beck and call with a feather duster standing on guard One, two, three, four. Hep, two, three, four. 'Tention! At ease. Squad right! Forward... march! Halt. Attack! I've got the guy who used to be my captain working for me He made me stay in the kitchen all day Now he's doing my K.P. And by and by I'm gonna have him wrapped in work up to his brow when he comes into the office I must get on my feet 'Tention! Make a retreat who was it said revenge is sweet I've got my captain working for me now I've got my captain working for me Captain working for me Captain working for me now I've always said you have a great future. If you'd just let me... Anybody hurt? I like hearing you sing. - I like hearing you say that. We've seen what passes for the floor show. Let's go, Mary. You can't make chumps out of my flapjacks. I wouldn't do that at your house! Johnny, you and I are dear friends. Will you go away? Jed! I thought we were having such fun. We'll let Jed have his way. We'll all go to the party. I accept. What party? - At the Woodside Inn. Mr. Dillingham is looking at his singers. Oh? I could ask you to come, but I know you can't get away. I have a place like this so I can get away. You joining us? Naturally. Strike up the band! Would you mind turning off the gas? Right-o! Thank you very much. He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone You'd be surprised He isn't much at a dance but when he's taking you home You'd be surprised He doesn't look like much of a lover But don't judge a book by its cover He's got the face of an angel But there's a devil in his eye He's such a delicate thing but when he starts in to squeeze Uh-mmm You'd be surprised He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knees You'd be surprised At a party or at a ball I've got to admit he's nothing at all But in a Morris chair You'd be surprised Wonderful party. - Yes... if there weren't quite so many people. - Oh, Jed? - Yes, Mr. Dillingham. Couple of things I want to talk to you about. First, what'll you have to drink? Oh, just a small arsenic. You dance very well, Johnny. You've heard of Maurice, the international dancing star? - Yes. Sold him his first pair of pumps. - No! Yes! Nita, I happen to be in show business myself. Waiter! - Yes, sir. He looked a little familiar. A little familiar I don't mind. These high-class places! Don't you think we're gettin' off our course? we'd better head back. Why? - Why? I had a reason, but it slipped my mind. What do you think we'll find in here? - Us, you suppose? Let's go in and see. - All right. Very private in here, hmm? - Isn't it nice? Do you think Jed's gonna like this? How could he? He isn't here? - I noticed that. Fellas can get punched in the nose for things like this. I don't believe you're worried. - Oh, these dancers... they're quick on their feet, shifty. He might cut me to pieces before I could tag you. How long you going to keep this thing going? - What thing? This burn on Jed. That's what I'm here for, isn't it? Oh, no! - No? No! I like you, Johnny. Well, that's a strange coincidence. I like you, too, Mary. When I first saw you, it was like meeting someone from home. - Yeah? This is only my second year away from Duluth and... the people I've met here, around the theater mostly... seem irresponsible... and not like you. Irresponsible, huh? You know, you remind me a lot of George. - George? My brother-in-law: his charm, sincerity... and the word dad always uses... stability. Stability, huh? Hmph. You know what I like about George? - What? His sister-in-law. I'm sorry she's going on the road. Johnny, I'll miss your place, the Flapjack. I'll miss it too. - You? Yeah, I sold it today. I have other plans. A bigger place? - A smaller place, more intimate. Gonna call it the Hole In The wall. Won't a smaller place make less money? - If I'm on my toes, it will. I don't understand. Did you ever have a good, new hat that you grew tired of? Of course, but aren't nightclubs more expensive? More fun too. I guess Jed wasn't joking about your betting on that horse. No, I don't think Dad would say you have stability. - No. I still like the way you sing. I still like to hear you say it. But I think you sing the wrong kind of songs. You do? Not that comic songs aren't all right, but take the one they're playing now. Do you know it? No, the words... - Sing it. -All right. So it won't be a total loss, let's dance. All by myself In the morning All by myself In the night I sit alone In a cozy morris chair So unhappy there Playing solitaire All by myself I get lonely watching the clock on the shelf I'd love to rest my weary head On somebody's shoulder I hate to grow older All by myself Hello. Oh, hello. - Why, Jed, how are you? Mary, may I remind you that since the beginning of time, women have been attracted to shiftless, unreliable, no-good vagabonds. The wise woman runs from this sort as she would from the plague. Nothing personal, dear fellow. - Of course not, dear friend. What he told you is very true. I've changed my mind, if you still want me in the Dillingham show. That's great! She's brighter than I thought. And, Johnny, I won't be going on the road. 'Remember, we were now in the Roaring Twenties, 'the era of flaming youth, prohibition, ballyhoo and bathing beauties. 'The dancing was cheek-to-cheek and people were worried about the younger generation, 'which, in turn, is now worried about the younger generation. 'Mary saw a lot ofJohnny, but more ofJed... 'who, as promised, got her into the Dillingham show. On the night of the Broadway opening...' A night in June A silvery moon A falling star A steel guitar A plaintive tune A lovesick boy A heart awhirl A serenade To an old-fashioned girl A perfect dream A perfect dream A matchless pearl A matchless pearl A serenade To an old-fashioned girl A lovely maid A half-drawn shade A serenade to an old-fashioned girl Nice work! I'm proud of you. They didn't throw anything at me. - Throw anything? Stick with me and they'll throw diamonds. - Jed, you're on! I am? How am I doing? - Jed, please! Okay, I'm ready! For you, Mary. - Me? Johnny? Have you seen the well-to-do Up and down Park Avenue On that famous thoroughfare with their noses in the air High hats and Arrow collars white spats and lots of dollars Spending every dime For a wonderful time Now, if you're blue and you don't know where to go to why don't you go where fashion sits Puttin' on the Ritz Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat Perfect fits Puttin' on the Ritz Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper, super-duper Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks Or umbrellas in their mitts Puttin' on the Ritz Nice goin', Jed! Come in. Oh, sorry. - All right, Jed. Mary, wait for me after the show. We have serious celebrating to do. - Oh, I'm sorry I can't, Jed. I'm going to be busy. - Busy? Tonight? - Uh-huh. Johnny? - Yeah. Be careful. That sort of thing can lead to marriage. If I'm lucky. - Oh. If it's a husband you're after, I might... No, that's against all my principles. I might reconsider. Jed, will you change. You're on right after the sketch. Right! I'm not gonna say anything against Johnny, not because I'm a gentleman, but because I know it won't do any good. Seriously, do you believe he's the right man for you? No... but he's the only one. You think he's the sort who's likely to propose marriage? Yes, Jed, I think he will... tonight. And if he doesn't, I will. There's only one thing left for me to do. What's that? Go and get changed for my next number. A beautiful place! A beautiful place you have! I tell you, I have a few ideas. - What do you propose? Say, doesn't she look like the new Dillingham star, the beautiful Miss... What is her name again? - Johnny! I heard what a big hit you were tonight. Made me feel good, but I wasn't surprised. Big thrill, huh? - Bigger thrill if you'd been there. I intended to be. Had my ticket, third row center. Good seat. - But I got tangled up with this fellow. Say, Johhny, this wall's plaster, no? - That's right. We push him out. - Remodeling? Mr. Rakopolis is. He's the new owner. - New owner? I sold him the Hole In The wall just before show time. That explains this here. - Oh, I see. That Johnny! Such a man to do business with! I buy the place unfurnished, he throws in the furniture! Why? He's sick of it. Wait'll you see the new place. I'm gonna have... Johnny, let's go some place quiet where we an talk. Sure, if you want to. But I can't right now. I gotta do a song here. Not so far from here there's a very lively atmosphere Everybody's goin' there this year And there's a reason The season opened lastJuly Every since the U.S.A. went dry Everybody's goin' there I'm goin' too I'm on my way to Cuba That's where I'm goin' Cuba That's where I'll stay Cuba Where wine is flowing And where those dark-eyed Stellas Light their fellas panatellas Cuba Where all is happy Cuba Where all is gay Why don't you plan a wonderful trip To Havana Hop on a ship And I'll see you in C-U-B-A Cuba why don't you do your drinkin' like a Cuban That's where I'm going instead of hiding in a cellar Cuba Since prohibition tell me pal, have you been That's where I'm staying A very frightened little fella Cuba why don't you pour it from the bottle Where wine is flowing 'Stead of a tiny silver flask Drink your Scotch, rum and gin where the dries can't get in where dark-eyed Stellas Light the fellas panatellas The finest bars are there Cigars are there, only made In Cuba where all is happy I'm not a drinking lady I never smoked a panatella Cuba But I'm a she who likes to be Where all is gay, okay So let us leave our cares and troubles behind And tell them our new address is where They stay up late and drink 'til they're blind Blind, but nevertheless They're glad to see you In C-U-Como esta? I Muy bien! B-A B-A Why don't you travel with us on a train or a bus to Miami where we can begin to plan A wonderful trip on a plane or a ship that'll take us from Florida to Havana See you in C-U-B-A Mary's waiting for you upstairs. Upstairs? Thanks. Tony! Tony! This man insulted me! - He did? He did? - Yeah! Throw him out. That might not be necessary, if you behave yourself. If he behaves himself! - And if I don't? He'll break every bone in your body. You're so right. Maybe you don't know it, but I happen to be the bouncer here. Okay, start bouncing. Nita, I'd rather you didn't watch this. Messy, you know. Please. I think we'd better step outside. - A pleasure! Come on! Oh! Coward! You wanna buy a nightclub? How 'bout some champagne? No champagne? Tsk! It's absolutely incredible. No one gal could be that pretty. How's Jed? Fine. You know, I really intended to go to that opening. This the next place? No, that's a little spot I had in Cleveland. The next place is gonna be something! I'm gonna call it the Song Book. And when do you sell the Song Book? - Not selling, keeping. That's the place I've always dreamed about, but never could quite figure it out. Do you know, near the park, outdoors with fresh air and music, lights and scenery! No drunks. C'mon, this has been a big evening for you and me, hasn't it? I sell the place and you walk off with a big hit. It didn't mean a lot to me, Johnny. - No? Other things mean ever so much more. Like what? Want me to answer that? - Yes, if you'd like. You're more important to me, Johnny. See here, lady. You're a Broadway star. You better keep your sense of values. I'm in love with you, Johnny. You in love with me? - Yeah. I guess I am... plenty. Well, haven't I done more than my share? Do I have to propose too? Oh, Mary! Oh, Johnny! I'd have died if you'd said no. Mary, this is a very difficult thing to say. There's a lot of fellas cut out to be husbands, but I'm just not one of them. You like stability, and stability and I just don't get along. I might marry you and I'd be hurting you. That would hurt me too. I guess I'm just selfish. That's the way I am though. I didn't want this to happen, Mary. I just happened to be in the neighborhood. Something up? - Something's over. I guess a girl should know better than to propose. Mary.. you know... sometimes a place horse pays more than the winner. Now... if you'd like to try that proposal a second time... 'During the months that followed Mary tried to forget Johnny. 'And Jed was usually there to make forgetting easier. 'They danced together, dined together and went to the movies together. 'Those were the days when the nation was keeping cool with Coolidge... 'and discovering fabulous gold in Wall Street's ticker tape. 'The younger people were keeping a little less cool 'with the screen's great love legend... 'Rudolph Valentino. 'Another year brought another Broadway show forJed and Mary. 'The day after the opening, as the company was rehearsing...' Keep it up, girls. Oh, no! The right foot, not the left. How are you? - Oh, hello. I'd like to see... Mary O'Dare, please. Angie, show her which is her right foot, please. Well, look who's here! Johnny, come on in! Twinkle-toes, how are you? Sure glad to see you. Tony. - How are you, Jed? Been almost a year, hasn't it? A wonderful year. Angie, give them all ten minutes. Okay, kids, take ten. See you later. I caught your opening last night. Good opening. I thought you were on a little bit too long. Thanks very much. You haven't changed. Not a bit. There must be an audience for your kind of dancing, but I never could go for it. You needn't apologize for your lack of taste. Anybody can have a blind spot. There was a girl in the show. She was grand. Mary? - Yes. Isn't that funny. we were talking about you just a year ago, you and your quaint little nightclubs. Charming, but you won't take offense? - Not at all. I know the atmosphere your customers like. But would it be too daring if you occasionally had the joint swept out? You still have the heart of a janitor. Where is Mary? Um, uh - Say, Johnny! Don't you remember? Passaic, New Jersey? Cliff was at the piano when we played the Bijou. Old Cliff, huh? How are you? You guys had a sweet little act. I remember it very well. - That's more than he ever did. Is that so? Johnny, do you remember this? Song and Dance Man. - Song and Dance Man. - That's right. He didn't remember it then, how can he know it now? Oh, get out! I bet I could do it now. You wanna try it? - What? Can you play it? - Sure. Go ahead. - Play it. In us you see a couple Of song and dance men I'm the song I'm the dance For laughter joy and happiness We're advance men With a song and a dance I sing for my supper I dance for my lunch I croon when the landlord comes around For miles around the women And children pass out cold When my voice hits the air And my feet hit the ground Last night Out in the moonlight I came to serenade A very pretty maid I sang her to sleep with 'Asleep In The Deep' That always makes them collapse I saw her eyes close Then she started to doze But she arose when I sounded taps Which goes to show what women Will do when we're around And my voice hits the air And my feet hit the ground Ladies and gentlemen, my partner Will now give you his impression... of a young man on the way to visit his best girl on a Sunday afternoon. My partner. A young lady crossing the street on a rainy afternoon. Skip the gutter! - Whoo! A young man on his way to the saloon to get a scuttle of suds, otherwise known as 'rushing the growler.' My, he's been in that saloon a long time! A porter helping you rush to catch the 5:15 train. We will now do two lumberjacks meeting on the street. Hiya! Timber! Our next impression will be two local politicians meeting on the street. My friend! - Hello! Here, here, here! - I've been layin' off, friend. Our next impression will be two farmers, Hy and Sy, meeting on the street. Hi, Sy! - Morning, Hy! Well, what're we waiting fer? - Let's get at it. How 'bout a little cream? Hey! Whoo! Johnny, you sure surprise me. With a couple more rehearsals, I can use you. Oh! All right, girls, places. Say, Jed, I didn't come here to reminisce. Where's Mary? - Mary? Oh, I'm glad you mentioned her. Got something to show you. Is it for Mary? Yeah. You're a lucky guy. Hello, Johnny. Hello, Mary. Congratulations. - Thank you. Saw the show? Oh, yeah the show! Yeah. You were great. I, uh... sort of thought you might drop over to my place... the two of you! Oh, we might do that sometime. What place you got now? Still the Song Book. I'm keeping that. Well, I just wanted you to know how much I liked you in the show. That's very nice of you, Johnny. You, too, Jed. - Thanks, Johnny. So long. Still over it? Completely. Call me at the bank, uh, Federal Reserve, anytime between 10:00 and 3:00. I've always wanted to go out with a banker. How sweet. Tony! Don't forget, just ask for the vice president. Good day. Good thing he showed up. Why? I kind of had a feeling he was still on your mind, without realizing it, I mean. Oh, Jed! I've got something to show you. I've seen it. It's beautiful. I thought maybe the second look It's the fifth look, Jed. That's even better. You know what you're getting. No more nonsense. We're driving to Jersey to get married right now. Darling... you're sweet and considerate. I'm sure there's no other man in the world quite like you. But... - But! What an unpleasant word! Please let me think about it a little longer. Pretty sure it isn't Johnny? Quite sure. Certain? Why do you keep saying it's Johnny? It isn't Johnny. That's over. I told you that. Mary... one way or another, you're getting engaged tonight. That's Johnny's place. Let's not go in. I don't want to see him. But I want you to, Mary. Go and talk to him. Get things straightened out in your mind. No, Jed. I made that mistake once before. Look, darling, I don't think Johnny will ever care very deeply for anybody. But I am a little worried about your feeling for him. Anyway, it's time we found out. Come on. You keep coming back I'll wait here. Like a song A song that keeps saying Remember The sweet used-to-be That was once you and me Keeps coming back Like an old melody The perfume of roses in May Returns to my room in December From out of the past where forgotten things belong You keep coming back Like a song From out of the past Where forgotten things belong You keep coming back Like a song I'll be loving you always With a love that's true always When the things we planned need a helping hand Hey, buddy? Wanna buy a hot ring? Days may not be fair always That's lovely. Let's stop here. - Whoa. Giddap. Attendez! - Oh, a French horse. No, he's French Canadian, I think. Lunch. - Yeah. Packin' the kitchen. The master is famished. Happy, Johnny? - Mm-hmm. There was something I wanted to tell you. - About lunch? No, about me. what was it? Oh! It was about me being in love with my wife. - You better be. That's quite a face you have. - I'm glad you think so. I think I'll keep it. Oh, Johnny! Three weeks is such a short honeymoon. I was countin' on about 60 years. That's all right with me. Johnny, when we get back, would you mind if I helped out at the Song Book? I want to be with you. Sure. You're always with me. - It'll be such fun. If anyone comes in, I'll say, 'See that fascinating fellow over there? That's my husband. He owns the Song Book.' That might not be entirely accurate, honey. - Hmm? That fascinating fellow's not your husband. It's Mr. Rakopolis. Rakopolis? - Amazing little guy. Loves to buy nightclubs. You sold him the Song Book? - A very small loss! It was doing so well. wait'll you see the new place I have in mind. Johnny, didn't you say we were partners? - I was wrong. You are the boss! No. Junior partner, that's me. - Uh-uh. That position's filled. Honey, from now on I'm gonna be Mr. Stability. I don't make a move without checking with the boss. Okay?- Okay. You like kids, don't you? - Sure... even better than horses. I think we oughta have about five kids. First four oughta be girls, and the rest can be anything else you want. We're gonna think about the future, aren't we? - Right. Right. Johnny, look at that sky! It's gonna storm. No, not for us, honey. Never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurrying by when you're in love My, how they fly Blue skies Smilin' at me Nothin' but blue skies Do I see Blue birds Singin' a song Nothin' but blue birds All day long Never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurrying by when you're in love My, how they fly Blue days All of them gone Nothing but blue skies From now on Nothing but blue skies 'And for quite a while the skies remained blue forJohnny and Mary. 'He opened another nightclub, this time in Cleveland, a charming spot which he said he'd never sell.' Just a little room or two Can more than do A little man and wife That's if they're contented With the little things in life 'The Little Spot did all right, butJohnny had a better idea. That meant moving to St. Louis.' Not for all the rice in China Not for all the knobs on doors Would I agree to part with all thejoy you fill my heart with When you said I'm yours 'After a time, Mary got to feeling at home in St. Louis and wanted to stay. 'Johnny said they'd stay, and they did... 'until he got a much better idea. Oh, much better! A little Russian place in New York.' Every night You'll hear her croon Her Russian lullaby Rock-a-bye my baby 'Rather appropriate, that lullaby, 'because new responsibilities were in store forJohnny. 'For Mary, new anxieties about the future. It was on a Sunday afternoon...' Oh, Tony, look! Doesn't that make you sort of yearn for something? Yeah. Dinner. I'm starving. Will you stop that pacing? You're making me nervous. Sit down. I'll take over. Is Mary all right? - Yes, she's fine. Not too close. Tiny, isn't he? She! - Yes, she. The little lady weighs six pounds, three ounces. Is that good? Perfect. Not too close! What's the matter with you? Well, they always look like that. When my cousin... She's beautiful! - You think so? Yes. Doctor, can I go in and see Mary now? She's still half asleep, but you may see her. - Thank you. I'm sorry. Only the father. Hello, paleface. Johnny, where were you? I needed you. Believe me, I was so nervous I needed you too. Oh, you should've told me. See her? - Yeah, she's beautiful. Like me? - Like you. My child. What else would you expect? You're pretty pleased with yourself today, aren't you? Mm-hmm. - You pleased with me? Mm-hmm. Pleased with the baby too. She's lucky, isn't she, Johnny, being our child? We're lucky too, honey. She's going to college, isn't she? - Not right away. She'll have all the things we didn't have. - You betcha. You feeling all right? I had a baby today, a beautiful baby girl. I know. I had one too. Oh, don't be silly. Men don't have babies. - You wanna bet? Name one. - Me! That's right. Honey, I wanna tell you something. From now on my feet are gonna be on the ground, solid. No more shifting around from place to place, traveling around. - Thank you, Johnny. I got something I wanna show you. Don't go away. I made arrangements at the bank. We are gonna have the swankiest, most elaborate and best nightclub in all New York. Junior can wear ermine diapers trimmed in platina. There it is, honey, our gold mine. Bonsoir! Welcome to zee Top Hat. Mesdames, Monsieur, if you please. Are we too late for the show? No, it will start in about 15 minutes. I'm so glad. - I know you'll enjoy it. I am sure you will... until zee gets the check. Ah, Mademoiselle Nita. Vous etes tres charmante. Danke schoen. Auf Wiedersehen. Ah, the reservations! We have enough to fill this place for a month! Hear that, Jed? Everybody, step to the syncopated rhythm Let's be goin' with 'em when they begin You'll be sayin' Yes sir, the band is grand He's the best professor in all the land Listen to the pep that emerges from the middle Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin Oh, what music The clarineter could not be better Hear that strain I don't know just what it is But it's great They simply ruin it Look at 'em doin' it Come, come don't hesitate Everybody, step in if you wanna see a glutton when it comes to struttin' over the crowd wait 'til you see my little sweetie and me Step, step, step stepping around The Top Hat was a great success. It meant security, roots in the ground. The things Mary wanted, but not what Johnny wanted. So... Yes? No, but he is back in town. He just phoned from the station. Mr. Cuyler? Did he say he wanted to sell? Oh. Could you call in about 15 minutes? I'll be loving you always Mr. Cuyler? - Mary? The fisherman's home. How are you, Johnny? I'm a little tired. Working all day over a hot brook. It's good to be back. They were really bitin' up there this year, Mary. Everybody caught their limit. Tony caught cold. Baby awake? - No. She's all right, isn't she? - Fine. Johnny, a Mr. Cuyler phoned. Oh, Cuyler, hmm? That's a little business matter. I'm gonna see him in the morning about it. He said he was going to buy the Top Hat. Did he say that? You're not going to sell, are you, Johnny? Well, I was kinda... thinking about it. Sure you haven't made up your mind? Yeah, I guess I have. Without consulting me? I didn't consult you because I knew what you'd say. In other words, you want my opinion when it agrees with yours. Oh, Mary, that's not being fair. Wait'll you hear the things I got planned. A little nightclub in Albuquerque? - No, Louisville. You know how I feel about the Top Hat, why I take these trips. The joint's too big. There's no fun there. It's the most successful place you've ever had, Johnny. And we have a child. - A wonderful child. I don't want you to sell. - I promised Cuyler. You promised me too! Johnny, in the three years we've been married, I've done the things you wanted, whether it was go to St. Louis, Cleveland or the movies. I've been selfish. - Maybe... without realizing it. But this time, I want my way. I insist you don't sell. - You insist? That's a strong word. It's the way I feel. If our marriage... - Our marriage? You mean this can make a difference? - Yes, it can. Well, it can't be much of a marriage. - Well, is it? What kind of a question is that? - I'm not blaming you. I haven't forgotten about not wanting to be tied down. I'm not tied down. If you're not, it isn't a marriage! I'm tied down and you've got to decide whether you want to be. I don't get it. If I sell the Top Hat, you and I are washed up? That's exactly what I mean. I don't like threats, Mary. Probably Cuyler. - Probably. Hello. Hiya, Cuyler. Mm-hmm. Certainly. Draw up the papers. I'll have my lawyer see you in the morning. Right. 'That's the way it happened. 'Johnny and Mary parted, each convinced that the other was no longer in love. 'The separation was painful, but being proud, neither would back down. 'Ayear went by, then another. Mary never heard from Johnny. 'And when Johnny heard from her, it was through her lawyer. 'A divorce had been granted. 'The following spring, Mary was in another show... with Jed. 'Johnny, who had been wandering aimlessly opening and selling nightclubs, had a new place in Chicago: the Cracker Barrel.' Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to meet dear Mrs. Murgatroyd. It's her 18th wedding anniversary, an occasion of some significance. She thought she'd like to see what the inside of a cocktail lounge looks like. Dear Mrs. Murgatroyd. She's a grand girl, grand girl! My feet are killing me! Young man? Young man! Would you mind just watching this bag please? Thank you very much. Young man... that bag. Hmph! Oh! Oh, well, waiter, I don't know exactly what to order. I, uh... I am not a drinking woman. I'm celebrating my wedding anniversary and I thought that you might- Thank you. Eighteenth anniversary. Thank you. You're very kind. I thought that you might have some drink that is sort of... oh, I don't know, sort of anniversary-ish like. Hmm? No, I've never had a... waiter, I've never had a drink in my life! Well, once in a while a little slug of gin, just a very little bit. Hmm? You would suggest what? Oh, no, no. Something very mild. Something like a, um... like a zombie. Why do you stare? Oh, never mind. Just bring me a scotch and soda. Thank you. Oh, waiter, no, just leave it. I'll mix it mysel - waiter, just leave it, please. I'll mix it. I'd rather mix it myself. Thank you. Lucy! Lucy Jamison! Imagine finding you in here! The president of our lodge. Oh, no. Oh, no you haven't. Lucy, I have never been in here before in my life! Tell me, are you still living on the top of Highland Avenue? Oh, that steep hill? Oh, Lucy, what a hill for you to climb! And in your condition, too, you know. Oh, you just come in here nightly for one shot to send you up the hill! Oh, I see. Mm-hmm. Oh, I must be getting home and get those potatoes on. I want to have a wonderful meal for Chesley when he comes home from the office. I have celery for him. I have fresh vegetables for him. I have a big goose for him. I... Lucy, what did you do, order another one? But you know I never touch- Lucy, I never... Oh, I guess it being a special occasion it wouldn't hurt. Well, down the hatch. You know, that wasn't as strong as the first one. Eighteen years. Eighteen wonderful years with Chesley. So you can see just... So you can see just... Excuse me, Lucy. So you can see just... That makes me so mad. I just paid $17.50! They shouldn't whistle back at me like that. Whee! Lucy, do you find it kind of warm in here? I don't think this place is air-conditioned. Lucy, I think I... I think I'm gonna be all right. No, it's nothing you've said. Lucy, it's nothing you've said, dear. I'll be all right in just a minute. I was just thinking. Eighteen years! Eighteen years with Chesley. Now I can speak the truth. It's been 18 horrible years! I work and slave over that hot stove all day long... while he works down in that nice, cool sewer. The only thing he's bought me in the last year, in the last year, is this stinking hat! Oh, dear, I must get home and get those potatoes on. Lucy, let's you and I go somewhere where it's peaceful and quiet. No noise, no music, just peace and quiet. I'd like to tell you the story of my life. Let's go to the Three Deuces. What, dear? The what? The potatoes? Oh, to heck with the potatoes! I'm getting out of here. Come on, dear. Nita! - Oh, Tony. Am I glad to see you. What's the matter with you? - With me? Oh! Oh, darling. Where's Johnny? - In the office. How's Mary? - Oh, she... Tony, I have so much to tell you. Order me a drink. Yeah. Nita! What are you doin' in Chicago? - What am I doin' in Chicago? Don't you read the papers? Just the racing form. You running at Arlington? Oh, Johnny. I'm in the show, Heat Wave, with Mary and Jed. Oh. Didn't you know we open here Monday? I read about it somewhere. You're sure lookin' swell. Things been goin' all right? Fine, Johnny. And you? - All right. Are you coming to the opening? I'd like to catch it, but, uh... New cafe and new help, I really oughta stand by here and help out. Johnny? - Hmm? The baby's here. - Yeah? Gee, she must be gettin' to be a big girl now. Oh, you wouldn't know her. I suppose I wouldn't. Mary all right? You're still in love with her, aren't you? We're divorced. She's in love with you, Johnny. Did she say so? She doesn't have to. Go and see her. Oh, Nita, I... You'll have to excuse me. We're really busy here. How much do I love you Why don't you come in and see us again sometime? Soon, huh? I'll tell you no lies She's staying at the Sir Francis. How deep is the ocean How high is the sky How many times a day How many times a day Do I think of you Do I think of you How many roses Are sprinkled with dew How far would I travel To be where you are How far is the journey From here to a star And if I ever lost you How much would I cry How deep is the ocean How high is the sky How deep is the ocean How high is the sky Hello, Martha. When I heard your voice over the phone, I couldn't believe it. It's so nice to see you. - Thank you, Martha. Did Mary say what time she's likely to be back? No, she didn't. I suppose the baby's asleep. - Not that one. She's a night owl. Could I see her? - Of course. I think I'd better leave you two alone. All right. Hello, Mary Elizabeth. - Hello. Who are you? I'm an old friend of your mother's. Good friend? - I hope so. Now I know who you are. You do? Uh-huh. Mommy showed me your picture. You're my old daddy, aren't you? That's right. I'm pleased to meet you. The feeling is mutual. Do I rate a kiss? Oh, no! Why not? Mommy says I mustn't kiss strangers. I'm not exactly a stranger. I knew you when you were that big. I must've been very young. - Yes, you were very young. Okay, you can kiss me. How 'bout going to bed now? Will you tell me a story first? what kind of a story? Do you know the story about 'Running Around in Circles'? It's a very good story. I'm sorry, I don't know that one. It's on my piano. Mommy sings it for me. will you sing it? Then will you go to bed? - Uh-huh. - You got yourself a song. It's my piano. Uncle Jed gave it to me. - Uncle Jed, huh? Your Uncle Jed's a pretty nice man. This the song here? It's quite a thing. A greyhound who had lots of speed was surely bound to fail For morning, noon and evening He'd be chasing his own tail He was running around in circles Running around in circles getting nowhere A squirrel in a treadmill cage Around and 'round he'd go You'd think that he'd be in a rage But seems he didn't know He was running around in circles Running around in circles getting nowhere The man who runs a carrousel Is often heavy-hearted He rides all day but sad to say He winds up where he started So... concentrate and clear your mind Of schemes that never last Or you'll wake up someday and find Your chances all have passed You've been running around in circles Running around in circles getting nowhere Getting nowhere Very fast You're right, honey. That's a very pretty story. It has a message too. You sing nice. - Thank you. Can you kick your heels up in the air? Oh, no, not lately. Uncle Jed can. - I should say he can! Do you like your Uncle Jed? Oh, yes! I was going to marry him. - You were? But Mommy is. She is? - Uh-huh. Next week. I'm invited to the wedding. Want to see my invitation? Isn't that an invitation? That's what it is. - Did you get one? You better go to sleep. Good-bye, Daddy. - Bye, Mary Elizabeth. You mean, right away? But... Johnny, we're doing so well! Okay. I just mentioned it. Well... good luck. Tony! - Mary! Darling. - Hello, Jed. - Hello, Tony. Is Johnny here? No, he, um... - He isn't? He just phoned. Said he was leaving town. As usual, I don't suppose he said where he was going. No, he just said he'd get in touch with me in a couple of months. Too bad. we wanted to ask him to our wedding. Jed, please. I'd invite you, Tony, but it's gonna be a small affair. I'm not even sure the bride will be there. Uh... could I get you a drink? - No, thanks. Well, uh... I need one. Come on, sugar. Darling - I know, I know. That two dollars I spent for the marriage license, shot to pieces. Oh, I wish I didn't love him. But I guess I always will. I know how it is. Oh, Jed! Mary. Yes, Dan? Maybe you can talk to Jed. He's hittin' the bottle. If he ain't steady, that 'Heat wave' dance can be pretty dangerous. I have talked to him and it doesn't help. Can't you cut out the number? I suggested that. He just laughed. Is like a melody That haunts me Come in! Night and day Oh, if it isn't Miss Melody herself! I was thinking about you. A pretty girl... - Jed. - ...is like a melody Remember that night back in New York? The show was closing? Darling, I'm worried about you. - Me? Why? That. - That? Oh, that! That's very good. It's 20 years old. Don't you think you oughta cut out the 'Heat wave' number tonight? At least the part on top of the bridge. Silliest thing I ever heard. You see that straight line? You watch. Whoops. Steady as the well-known rock. Here's to the most beautiful girl Please, Jed. I hear you're leaving the show. - Saturday. Saturday. Well, what do you think of that? That calls for a final drink. - No, Jed. Oh, yes, Jed. And oh, yes, Mary. Gotta have a final drink. In fact, it's the final, final, final drink. Please be careful. Of course I'll be careful. I'll be very careful. Five minutes, Mr. Potter. Right. A heat wave blew right into town last week She came from the island of Martinique The cancan she dances will make you fry The cancan is really the reason why we're having a heat wave A tropical heat wave The temperature's rising It isn't surprising She certainly can... cancan She started the heat wave By letting her feet wave And in such a way that the customers say that She certainly can... cancan Gee, her anatomy Made the mercury Jump to 93 Yes, sir We're having a heat wave A tropical heat wave The way that she moves that thermometer proves that She certainly can... cancan It's so hot the weatherman will tell you A record's been made It's so hot a coat of tan will cover your face in the shade It's so hot a hefty maiden Lost 20 pounds from each side It's so hot a chicken laid an egg in the street And it fried we're having a heat wave A tropical heat wave The temperature's rising It isn't surprising She certainly can... cancan 'That cured Jed Potter of drinking. 'It was the last time he ever danced, 'and the last time he ever saw Mary. 'Believing she had destroyed the lives of the two men she loved, 'Mary disappeared... went to Europe, we heard. 'When the Second World War started, there were reports Mary had returned to America. 'But we never found her. Johnny was doing a job at the time. Remember?' Any bonds today Bonds of freedom That's what I'm selling Any bonds today Scrape up the most you can Here comes the freedom man Asking you to buy a share of freedom today This is the army Mr. Jones No private rooms or telephones You had your breakfast in bed before But you won't have it there anymore This is the army Mr. Green we likes the barracks nice and clean You had a housemaid to clean your floor But she won't help you out anymore I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write May your days be merry and bright And my all your Christmases be white Well, that's our story as far as it goes. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have a little surprise. It just so happens that that certain Johnny Adams is in the studio with me. I wonder, um... Johnny? Yes, Jed? How'd you like to put a nice finish to this story? I'll try. You keep coming back Like a song A song that keeps saying Remember The sweet used-to-be That was once you and me Keeps coming back Like an old melody The perfume of roses in May Blue skies smiling at me Nothing but blue skies Returns to my room From out of the past Where forgotten things belong You keep coming back Like a song
