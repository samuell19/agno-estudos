No one is ever ready for this moment. I thought I would be... There is still so much to see. Still so much to do. Is this it? Listen. What is it? Sh. You hear that? It sounds scared. That's because it is. Do you think it knows why we shot it? No. It just knows it wants to stay alive. Is that why he keeps running? That's all he can anymore. Just listen for the bleats. That'll take us right to it. All right, you see that? Yes, sir. All right, look around. What else do you see? Mm. Good job. Always keep an eye out. You never know what you'll find. All right, stay back. We need to wait. What would happen? Sometimes animals give up, while others fight. Why? Because when they're fighting for their lives, Sweet Pea, they can be dangerous. All right, just give it time. Why? Because he's still got some fight left in him. It could be suffering. That's better. We're closed. Don't you light that damn thing. Another. First, Tamila. Okay? I'm good, man, I'm good. Hm. You're good, eh? I'm good. You jumped like a little bitch. Gracias, dickhead. Give me a few minutes to clean up and I'll take your ass home. Uh-huh. I'm gonna go use the little girls' room. I always knew you peed sitting down. Careful you lock the door, bitch. I'll do it myself, pendejo. Don't fucking move. Don't fucking move, stay right there. Let's go, man, hurry up! You two are stupid or arrogant, or both. What? Just get the fucking cash, hombre! Do you know who owns this place? Do I look like I give a shit? You are dangerously close to a line I suggest you do not cross. What the fuck is he talking about? Man, he's just trying to scare us. Empty the fucking register, Pedro! I'm telling you, you don't want to do this. What I want is for you to shut the fuck up! What I want is for you to take out every last penny in this shithole! What the fuck did you drag us into? Man, you could kick a soccer into Mexico from here, man, you figure it out! Is this the fucking cartel? Relax, we're gonna be long gone before they finish their morning cervezes. Fuck. Move it Let's go! Oh, no. Now the safe. No way, that is not happening. If I give you that, we all die. Oh, is that right? - Son of a bitch! - Come on, come on! Either you die now, or you give yourself a head start. Make a choice! Move it! Ah. Ooh wee. It's a good thing you found him, because I'm getting way too old for all this walking around. All right, do you want me to get you a wheelchair? Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you done yet? I'd be done if I had a extra pair of hands. Well don't wait for... Oh, I know. Don't wait for someone to do something for you when you can do it yourself. - Damn straight. - Mm-hm. You know what? Mama gonna have you looking like this deer for not helping me. Mm. It's a good thing you got your mother's mouth and my aim. Really? Did you ever tell her that? Well, no. Would you come help me please? Oh, you need my help? Yes, I do. Hold on, let me look for my wheelchair. Come on, stumble on. Just hold that part for me. All right, all right. Thank you. Ah. So, are you excited? I am. I am actually. All right. You know, I think this is, this is gonna be good for us, Dad. You know, I fail to understand why you still give this Negro the time of day. He said he was sorry. He should be sorry. Hell, if I even looked at a woman, you mother would have taken me on a long trip down a short dirt road, believe me. I think everything's gonna be fine. Fine? Yes, it's gonna be fine. What if something happens? Now what's gonna happen? Nothing is gonna happen. This joker can't even fight his way out of a wet paper bag. What do you mean, what if something happens? Oh, gosh. You know what? I learned from a certain couple that, you don't give up on someone you love. Where in the hell did you learn that from? Mm-hm. Listen, I promise. If this doesn't work out, I'll come back alone. Just make sure you have a good alibi, okay? Still not gonna kill him, Dad Damn. All right, Dad. I love you. - Now wait, hold on. - Yeah. Here. Go ahead now, it aint gonna bite. Dad, I can't take that. Yes you can. How many tours did you take that on? Enough. Now here, go ahead, take it. Thank you. All right. All right. I love you. I love you too, Sweat Pea. Call you when I get on the road. Yes you will. - Hey, hon. - See anything? It's in the back. I'm gonna go change. Oh boy. Damn, that's bull, man. Mr. Harold. Daniel. Got one, huh? Now many horns? Good Lord, Son, it's called points. Not horns, points. Right, points. Here's a list of numbers. Places we'll be. Including numbers to the local authorities near the cabin. Just drop that on the seat. I'll take care of your baby girl. Hell, she'll probably be the one taking care of me. Yeah, first of all, Carla's not a baby. And she don't belong to anyone. Yes, sir. And if she would take care of you the way I wanted her to, she'll be down a bullet. Go on, back off the car. Good talk. Glad we could work it out. Oh, gosh. You know, I didn't mean for you to pack everything. I know. I just wanted to make it as painless as I could. If you wanna cancel, we can. I know this time of the year you and your dad are in the woods somewhere. No, no, no no no no. I agreed to go... We agreed to go. And we need it. - Thanks. - Yeah. Your dad and I just had a nice talk. You didn't call them horns again, did you? Maybe. Oh God, you're gonna give that man a heart attack. You can make fun of me for not knowing now you count antlers, but it's okay that he don't know how to use a command prompt? Uh, yeah. Pretty much. We'll see about that when I have to wipe his drive because of all the bootleg porn he downloads. Just kidding. You got everything? Oh, almost. All right, I'm gonna take this stuff to the car. Need any help? No, I got it. All right, let's hit the road. Babe, can you look in the glove box? Yeah, sure. Uh. Is this what I think it is? Mm-hm. The license plate game? I could use my phone, but I don't think it would be as fun. God, I haven't done this since I was a kid. Bust that bad boy open then. Okay. Okay. Should start with ours. This is really beautiful. It's yours. What? You didn't hear? I bought this entire mountain just for you. Oh, mm-hm. I did. It's gonna be called Mount Daniel. Right, right, right. So how much did this set you back? What? Disclose my vast fortune out here? Mm-hm. Oh, I'm gonna go inside, okay? Wow. No, not yet, no, Daniel fixed me some tea. Okay. Okay, I love you too. Bye. Just the way you like it, half a cup of honey. Thank you. You're welcome, baby. That's a nice fire. How's your dad? Oh he's good, he's good. But he said the strangest thing. He wants us to get married? Oh, God no. That was smooth. I like to think so. Yeah, no, I was just trying to give him the numbers to all the places we would be, and he said he already had them. Seems like someone pretty awesome beat you to the punch. And might have earned some respect with that one. You or your dad? Maybe both. Mm-hm. All right, I confess, it was me. I know it was you. Did I just do something right? Oh gosh, don't start. Don't do it. Tomorrow night, me and you, the fanciest, most fancy place you wanna eat. Mm, it's my turn to pay, isn't it? Yep. I figured. My treat, how's that sound? That sounds great. It's moments like this that reminds me of how good we are together. Yeah. It's about our bedtime. Mm, you're right. Aren't you coming? No, I think I'm gonna sleep by the fire. Okay. Sure you don't wanna come? No, I'm okay. But good night, though. Guess that is a good night. - Howdy. - How you doing? Good. Everybody staying warm out there? Marlboro menthols. Sorry, fresh out. Camels? Those too. What do you got? What do you have? What? It's have, not got. What do you have? I got Kools. Will that do you? Yeah. Yes. Please. Here you go. No, not the beer. Dios. Let's see. All right, that'll be 18... Well. 12.59. You have to excuse my brother. He has some bad habits. Oh hell, it's all right. So long as you don't hold up the place. I understand this is a ski lodge, but what is this all around? Well, let's see. Nothing really. Except up north. All this is open hunting land. From this point right here. Thank you. You boys doing some hunting? Something like that. Well, good call on the beer. You don't wanna be out there without your senses about you. Thanks. Come. Have a good one. Next time, don't bring me to this fucking shit hole, bro. Shit holes don't have cameras. Ooh, look at that, how beautiful. Wow. Oh, we need to go there later. It's gorgeous. Yeah, oh but remember, we still gotta go by that place with all the '80s stuff in it. Oh, that's right. You think we'll have time? We'll make time. Yeah? Are you gonna make time for me afterwards? After, before, in the middle, at the '80s store. Mm, and I have something I'm gonna wear for you. Ooh. Yeah. I'm sorry, hey. I'm sorry, guys. I'm Jerrod, this is Ashley. - Hey. - Hi. And we are excited. Yeah, and we're newlyweds. Honeymoon, baby. Oh, wow, congratulations. Thanks. Yeah. So, are you, uh... No. Aw, shoot. What's wrong, baby? I'm not getting any cell service. Probably not gonna get one up here. Oh, excuse me. Yeah? Are we gonna be anywhere where I can get some cell signal? No, not until we get back down. Are you kidding me? All right, ladies and gentlemen. All right. Oh, thank you. Of course. Be sure to follow the path. The sooner you get signed in, the sooner you're on the mountains. Enjoy. Excited? I am excited. Good, me too. Oh. Whoa, you all right? You all right? Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine. Ice'll get you every time. I know. How are you? Good. I'm Marlon. - Carla. - Carla. - Daniel. - Daniel. You guys headed up to the mountain? Yeah, you? Na, I'm too old to have fun. Oh gosh. No, I had to swing by to see if any of the equipment needs work. - Oh, okay. - Okay. I bet you see a whole bunch of tourists bust their butts, huh? If I had a dollar for every time that happened. Right. Nice to meet you. Yeah, for sure. Have fun out there. Thank you. Be safe, huh? Thank you, you too. Oh my God. All right, everybody, follow me. Come out this way. All right, everybody, gather around. Everybody here? Yeah. All right, good. My name is Devin. The man to my left is my right-hand man. He's checking out all the equipment to make sure everything's ready to rock. Now Conner is leaving us at the end of the season, so let's make sure y'all follow our instructions so you get back safe. Oh, what's this gorgeous landscape too much for you, buddy? First of all, if you're bringing your cellphones along, you can take all the photos you want. Just make sure to keep them close to your body, because the cold weather will kill the battery. All right, now some of you might experience altitude sickness. If you notice any nausea, nosebleeds, headaches, swelling, let us know immediately, all right. Most importantly, listen to us at all times, okay. Mother Nature can be a bitch out here. So if you're going anything to put yourself and or others at risk, I will cut this trip short and we'll all head back. There'll be plenty of time for fun, but safety first, understand? - Yeah. - Yes. All right. Okay, so everyone now needs snowmobiles. Woo. Hey. I hate the fucking cold. We do it here. What if they see us? We need to push them up more. It's hunting territory. Looks like shit up there, bro. Exactly. Either you die now or you give yourself a head start, make a choice! Let's get outta here, Jay. Fuck this. Almost done. I don't give a fuck what's in the safe, okay. You know jacking the cartel's a stupid plan. You know that! Oh shit. Yeah, but for that much cash, I'll take stupid any day. Okay, crew, this is the halfway point. Let's take five, get some water. The fucking cartel? Relax, we're gonna be long gone before they finish their morning cervezas. Fuck fuck. Fuck fuck. - Yeah. - Oh. Hey, man, we got some people struggling. - Any aspirin? - Yeah, yeah, come on. Okay. All right, who's not feeling too good? Oh, she's, her head's killing her. Take a couple of these. - Thanks. - Take two. They can have some water too. Yeah. Here, take a water. Thank you. Drink that up. Let me know how you guys are feeling in a little bit. - Yeah. - Okay. Hey, you guys need a water? Yeah, thanks, Conner. Yeah, absolutely. It's frickin' freezing out. It's pretty out here, isn't it? I guess. Hey, I got two more fucked up over there. I'm just gonna take them to the mountain. Yeah, you take them down, I'll finish up. You sure? Got get in the sights while I can. I'll radio down. I'll let them know you're coming. Okay, appreciate it. Yeah. Hey, this is Conner. Devin's bringing some tourists back down. Do we need to call an ambulance? No, just the usual. All right, we'll be here. Let's go! Woo! Why we stopped? All right, guys, if we take 15 minutes. I got a great spot up this hill. It's gonna be a trek, but we're gonna get some great pictures. How about that? - Yeah. - Cool. - Yes. - All right. I'm telling you, my Instagram is the best Instagram. Let's go. Just stay on the path, all right, guys. - All right. - Great job, man. Man, it's crazy, huh, but it's beautiful. How do you breathe up here, baby? Oh my God. Whew. What do you guys think? - Beautiful. - It's nice. I think that with a view like this you might be trying to get in my pants, bro. I know it was hell getting up here. I know that, but this is where I come when I need a break. You ever get tired of this? Not one bit. Then why give it up? I like to stay on the move. Why? Well, you know, you stay in one place too long and the things you love become everyday things. Yo, is that a wolf? We're fine, we're fine. No, no, I'm ready to go. You know out here you're more likely to get hurt by someone than you are something, so. Well, Conner, I don't wanna stay here and find out, so I'm out. I'm with her. You guys okay to go? All right. Yeah. Let's head out. What? No. Christian, are you okay? I'm so sorry. Guys, we had a safety speech for a reason. You know that? I know, I'm sorry. You okay? Yeah, I think I just rolled it, guys. Here, help me up. Let's get going. Come on. All right. You got it? I'm all right. All right, be careful going down, man. Christian! Oh, are you okay? Let's get him back to the snowmobile. Come on. I can't, I can't walk. Fuck. Aw, man. I got you, I got you. - Watch out. - No, give him some space. Careful. You all right? Yeah, I'm great. All right, stay close. We wanna get back before dark, all right? - Okay. - Okay. Yo, Conner, bro, my sled won't start. Mine neither. Ours is down too, man. Shit, shit, shit. What's wrong? It's not starting. How often does this happen? Never. I thought you checked them before we left. I did. What about the Marlon guy? Could he have overlooked something? Are we stuck out here? Sugar. Conner, are we stuck out here? No, no, uh. Let me radio down. I'll get someone up here. What is it? Radio's gone. What? When's the last time you saw it. Conner? What the fuck did you drag us into? Do you know who owns this place? The fucking cartel? Conner? - Hey, yo. - Conner? When's the last time you saw the radio? It was on the, it was on the windshield. It must have fallen off on the way up here, guys. Of course. So are we really stuck out here? No. Pack your stuff, we're walking. - What? - What? We're walking. What about Christian? You know what? I'll just stay here. It's beautiful. You guys send someone for me when you get back. I am not leaving you out here. Okay, look, aren't we supposed to, like, stay in the same place or something when you're lost? We're not lost, okay. Pack your shit, and let's fucking go. What the fuck is wrong with you, man? You're joking, right? All right, just relax, guys. Conner, is there somewhere else we can go, somewhere closer? Yeah, sure, you go up to the hunting cabins up north. If you wanna hike a mountain and go through all the snow, be my guest, all right. Well, what about the halfway point? Two hours on foot. But Conner, none of us are really... We don't know this climate, so, I mean, and with Christian's ankle, it's gonna be double time. Well then we better get going, right. What? You're joking. How you feeling? I just wanna stop. What you thinking about? Nothing. Something's up. It's nothing. No, I mean with Conner. Oh yeah, I kinda get that feeling too. Think he knows what happened back there? I don't know, but something has him rattled. I need to stop. Sun doesn't stop, so neither do we. Yeah, man, come on. I could use a break too. Oh baby. Baby, baby. Wait! Come on, babe, come on. Here, here we go. What's wrong, baby? I can't breathe. She'll be fine. Let's go. Hey, man. Can't you see she can't breathe? I'm telling you, she'll be fine. And we're telling you she needs a minute. Come on, man. That better? Yeah. Where's Conner? What? Conner! Conner! Did that son of a bitch leave us? I don't know. Conner! I think so, man. Conner! Don't worry. We're not here for them. I guess they didn't run fast enough. They never do. Guys, the guy who got popped at the bar, you know, he said it was gonna be a quick hit. I didn't even know whose bar it was. Conner! Conner! All right, you see that? Yes, sir. All right, look around. What else do you see? Good job. Always keep an eye out. That bartender meant a lot to a very powerful man. You don't gotta do this. What we do is not up to us. It was an accident. So was this. Fuck. No no no, no no. Fuck yeah. Take a picture. I know. Let them know that it'd ones, and then I want you... I know, delete. I know, I know. You tell me every fucking time. Ah, pretty. We should bury him. Animals will eat the evidence, bro. It's fucking great. What? Move. No no no. What the fuck, bro? We stick to the plan. What plan? Fuck! Bitch! We have to go, we have to go, we have to go. What's wrong? We have to go. What you talking about? I just saw some guys kill Conner. Are you serious? Yeah, I don't know who it was. They just had a rifle, and they just kept bashing his head. And so we have to go. - Let's go, let's go. - Okay. Oh, oh, get down, get down, get down, get down. What is it? Those are the two guys that killed Conner. Did they see you? I don't know, but I don't wanna stick around and find out. So what do we do now? We, we go north up the mountain. The lodge is south. Do you wanna go through them? Conner mentioned something about there being cabins up north. Maybe there's someone there. If not, maybe there's a radio we could use. Where'd they g? I don't know, but we gotta go. Come on. Conrad had told them that both Russians were clutching each other in a boozy embrace. And breaking into silly grins. Marlon, you out there? Marlon, put the book down and pick up. I hope this is important. I was getting to the good part. The book's gonna have to wait. We've got some missing tourists on the mountain. From the snowmobile lodge? Yes, sir. Sheriff wants to know if you can do us a favor and go take a look. Yeah, sure, I'll go take a look. Thanks, and let me know how the book ends. Sure, if I ever get to finish the damn thing. Yo, Daniel, what's up with your girl, man? What you mean? Why's she so pissed at you? She's not. Bullshit. Yeah, man, I gotta go with Jerrod on this one. What's the deal? Let's just say I messed up and leave it at that. Whatever, here's what I don't get. How does tech guy end up with the female version of Rambo. We balance each other out. Sounds to me like you might just not know how to handle yourself out here. You wanna find out? No, man, I'm just playing with you. Look look, look look. Cut the shit, man. Can your girl really get us out these woods? I'd bet my life on her? You bet all our lives on her? I will. I hope so. I told you. We shoulda popped them and been done with this shit. No, we stick to the plan. I think I'm gonna lose my shit, bro. Look, we're out of our element. This shit goes sideways, we're not making it home. The thing is, Dante, if I woulda taken the shot earlier, we'd have been a hell of a lot closer to getting home, bro. Fucking listen to me sometimes. Yeah yeah yeah, hold up, guys, hold up. Hey, hey, we've been going for like miles. We haven't seen them. I need a break. Yeah, come on. Chris needs a rest. Guys, we really don't have time. Carla, give us a minute. Yeah, seriously, Carla, I need a break. What he said. All right, let's take cover in those trees over there. Yeah, we'll do that. Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's all right, baby, it just hurts. No, don't touch. Put some ice on it. I'm glad somebody came prepared. Don't wait for someone to do something for you when you can do it yourself. Hold up, man. Aren't they gonna see the smoke? Maybe, but we need to worry about frostbite. All right. Take off your boot. We need to take care of your ankle. Are you a doctor? No, but... Then you could make it worse. I don't think we should touch this boot. No, we're not taking the boot. Yeah, they shouldn't touch the boot. If his ankle's broken, then you don't touch it unless you're gonna treat it. Right. Are you sure? I was a cheerleader in high school. I know what a broken ankle looks like. Okay, well, then we need to find a way to support it. But if you're not gonna treat it, then what's the point. Because we can't keep carrying him up and down the mountain. Especially with him screaming. But you're gonna make it worse. I need you to trust me. I don't. Hey, just relax, babe, all right. No. What are you doing? Sh. I'm sorry, okay. We just need to take the pressure off of your ankle. What about like a splint or something? Uh, uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess that's all we can do at this point. It's a good idea. All right, you guys keep warm. I'll be back. - I'll go with you. - Okay. Think we'll be okay? You know, now is really not the time to be talking about our feelings. I meant all of us. We just need to find the cabin and hopefully they have a radio. That doesn't answer my question. I don't know. I don't know, you know, if Dad was here... He goes wherever you go, and even if he's not, that's more than enough for me. Okay. Let's, let's just keep looking for more sticks. Whew. Did you get what you need? Hope so. You hope? Does anybody have a T-shirt or something? I think we might have one in our bag. Yeah, here you go. Bite down on this. What for? For what comes next. Why? Thanks. This is gonna be fun, huh? It's gonna suck. Whew. Okay, take these for me. Hold both sides for me. All right, let's get them back up a little bit. All right, one, two, three! Can you pull it back a little bit? All right, second one. One, two, three! Last one, okay? Ready? One, two, three! We're done, we're done, we're done. How does that feel? It felt good. I'm really no worse for wear. Can you take a step? Does it work? Ready? Let me help you, let's go. Got it? Okay. Fucking snow's so fucking deep. That's fucking bullshit. Well? Still warm. Good. Tracks lead through here. They can't be too far up ahead. Warm up. Fucking cold, man. Can't pull a trigger without a finger. Fuck this. Paz. Paz! Got one more. Paz! You know I never thought that I was gonna miss Cali so much. Going beaching. Yang's. I thought we were coming out here to get away from all this shit, and then we step right in the middle of it. How'd you guys meet? College. Don't lie. We met online. Brooke, come on. What? It's silly, but it's the silly truth. Get down! Get down! Christian. I can't move my legs. Babe, hey, she's alive. You can reach her! No no no, no no, no no no. What are you doing? I'm not fucking leaving her here! Sh. Sh. That's what they want. What do you mean? She's bait. Hey, Brooke. Baby, it's gonna be okay, all right? You're gonna be okay. Please help me. I don't wanna die. Fuck this, I'm gonna get her. Christian, no, no! Ow! Brooke, I can't get you. I need you to crawl to me, okay? Where's Christian? Brooke, I just need you to get to me now, okay? Come on. Oh yeah. Yo, bro. What the fuck did I tell you, huh? What I tell? We take them up north into hunting territory. Fuck off, bro. I got it from here, bro. Get your shit together, Paz, before I do it for you. Man, fuck this shit. Remember that pain next time you wanna try something stupid. Yeah, bro. And you're outta bullets. Bueno. Fuck! It just knows it wants to stay alive. Is that why he keeps running? It's all he can anymore. We need to keep going. No no on, it won't matter if we're not heading in the right direction. How do we know if we are. Look for anything that shows we're in a hunting ground. And? Hunters are generally never too far from a road. Oh my God, they're here. Shit, get behind me. Come here. We gotta go, we gotta go. Let's go, let's go. No no, no no no, stay put, stay put. What and end up like those two back there? Listen, we know what we're looking for. Let's just go, go. We can't leave them. Listen to me. If we split up, we have a better chance of surviving. No. We're safer together, trust me, Ashley. Yeah, then why is Brooke and Christian dead? No no, no no, no no no! Carla, I'm sorry. Jerrod, Jerrod. Ashley. Two sets. Follow the ones up the mountain. Hey, Paz. Where are the others? They left me. Don't worry. We got a long ways to go before I use this. No please. No please! I wanna see what you got? No. No. This little thing could be a problem. Please, please. Please, I don't deserve to die. Look at me. That wasn't part of the plan. Guess I have to improvise. Ashley, stop, stop! What? We gotta go back. For what? You just wanna let them die? If that's what it takes for us to survive, then so be it. Go, go, go go, go go! That wasn't a rifle. Oh snap. What? I guess we found the hunting grounds. Okay. Oh yeah. Sh sh, sh sh. Fucking kids wanna play this game now, huh? Get the gun, Ashley! Get the goddam gun! Get the gun! Follow me! Fucking bitch. Please, please, please! No! Okay, come over by this tree. Come on. It's gonna be okay, Daniel. Okay, hang in there. I can't breathe. The knife might have hit a lung or something. I'll just, I'll be right back, okay. I'll be right back. Carla, we both know I'm not gonna make it. No, listen, we have to keep on going. I can't. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Just go, please. No. No, I'm not leaving you out here. Listen. Carla, I'm staying here. Go find the cabin. I'll do what I can to stop them. No, no, we're stronger together. We can get out of this together. Just let me go get somebody. I don't wanna die together, but if you don't go on without me, that's what'll happen. I promised your dad. He wouldn't want me to give up. He wouldn't want us to give up. I'm not. I'm just trying to disgust him more. Was there anyone else out there with you? Snap out of it! Was there anyone else out there with you? Just me and my husband. Where is he? He's gone. They killed him. They killed everybody. Oh. I'm Marlon. What's your name? A-Ashley. Ashley. Okay, Ashley, do you know who was after you? I don't know. Okay, do you know why? I don't know, all right? All I know is that I'm not going back there for anybody. Wait. There are others out there, aren't there? Aren't there? What's wrong? Son of a bitch got me. We'll be okay. I love you. I'm sorry for everything. There's nothing to be sorry for. Okay? What was that noise? Sounds like a truck. Go, go go go, go. Are you sure? Go, get him. I'll be back, okay? Okay, okay. Sometimes animals give up, while others fight. Why? Because when they're fighting for their lives, Sweet Pea, they can be dangerous. I just wanna go home. Me too. Come on. Dante! I need you, brother. Marlon? She said it was just her husband. What? The woman I found. She said it was just her husband. Who, Ashley? Yeah. Where is she? I don't know. I tried to finish this job, bro, and fucking asshole came and popped me. He got you good. But the bleeding has stopped for the most part. Where's the gun? I still got it on me right here. Can you walk? Fuck, bro, I think so, yeah. Come on. I'm gonna get you some help, okay, just sit still. Do you have a radio? Yeah. Where is it? In my cabin. Where is that? You see that patch of trees? Cut through there. Go straight. Don't stop until you're inside. Okay. Okay. Here, take this. It's all I got. What about you? Shit, I was born on this mountain. I'm okay dying on it, too. Now. How many people have you killed? Enough to know not to waste a bullet on a dead man. I want you to know that this didn't start off personal? But now. Now it is. Wrong place, wrong time, huh? I guess so. I gotta say, you two put up a hell of a good fight. I admire that. If it wasn't for Carla, I'd have been dead a long time ago. Sounds like you got a hell of a good woman there. You haven't seen anything yet. Yeah, we'll see. Just give it time. Why? Because he's still got some fight left in him. It could be suffering. Hello. Hello, is anyone there, hello? Yes, who is this? This is Carla Young. Someone's after me, help! Someone's after you? Yes, yes! Where are you? Um, um, I'm, I'm north of the ski lodge in a cabin. Do you know who's cabin you're in? Marlon. - Sit tight. - I'll have someone out your way. Okay, can you just hurry please? Just stay near the radio. No, no! Hey, Sweet Pea. Oh, Dad. How you feeling, sweetheart? Don't don't, don't don't. I'm okay. You been out for a couple of days. What happened? The rescue team, when they found you, you were passed out, so they airlifted you here. Daddy, I thought that I was... Dead. Oh no. No, baby, now you know I taught you better than that. What's wrong? I left him. You left who? Daniel. I just left him out there. No, no no no no no. He's... He was hurt, and he told me to go, but I should have stayed. And you would have died. That is not what he wanted, okay? Okay. Now you hear me. That is not what he wanted. Dad, I killed people. Okay, okay, okay okay, listen, sh. I killed people. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. All right, I got something to tell you. I can do it myself. Honey. You okay? Yeah. I guess no more vacations for a while, huh?
