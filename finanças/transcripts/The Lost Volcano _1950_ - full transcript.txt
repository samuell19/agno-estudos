Daniel. I'm afraid we can't reach the station tonight, sun's going down. Tell the men to make camp. Yes, bwana. Daniel. Get the cooking fire started. We'll turn in early and break camp before dawn. Will do, bwana. Oto, bring it down. What happened, Daniel? Where's the guard? Who opened the cages? Don't know, bwana. Look, bwana! What happened, what happened? Nuku said white boy came, knock him down, named Bomba. Live other side, big mountain. Maybe bwana heard about him. Yes, I've heard about Bomba and all the other local legends. But ask him what really happened. Please, bwana, Bomba real man. They go off that way. Nevermind, nevermind, the damage is down now. We'll have to re-outfit and start all over again. Tell the men to go back to sleep. David, dear, don't you think you could eat a little more slowly? Yes'm, I guess I could, but I've got an awful lot of things to do today. No doubt, but they can't be as important as all that. He is very young, Madame, and the young are always hungry. Is that not so, David? I am. But you oughta see those leopard cubs of mine go after that nursing bottle you fixed up. Jam pots empty, Nona. Then go and fill it yourself, David. Nona hasn't had a bit of breakfast yet. - Please, Madame. - Sure, Mom. Let me. Nona and I understand each other, Mom. All the more reason why you shouldn't take advantage. Not even any thanks, David? It is nothing. Gee, Nona, you're swell. When I get those cups weaned, you can have one. It's Daddy, he's back! Give the men a week in the villages then I want 'em back to make safari again. Will do, bwana. Daddy, you're back! Well, Dave, how's my boy? Oh, just fine. Paul. Hello, Rose. Mm, it's good to be back. What's the matter, Daddy? Didn't you catch any animals? Oh, I caught 'em all right then lost 'em all within three hours of home. Lost? How on Earth lost? That's what I'd like to know. Most mysterious thing I'd ever have happened to me. Hello, Nona. Someone slipped into camp and opened the cages. - Thank you, dear. - Didn't you have a guard? Sure, sure, but he told some crazy story about that imaginary character, Bomba. I bet it was true, Daddy. Bomba said it's not right to put wild animals in cages. Now, look here, young fellow. Didn't we agree that you weren't to bring up the subject of your supposed friend Bomba anymore? Yes, sir, but I didn't bring it up, you did. I'm afraid he's got you there, dear. I guess he has, at that. Anyway, I want you to stop making up fairy tales about this imaginary jungle boy. He isn't imaginary, honest. He lives in the mountains and sometimes he comes down to play with me. - He says he gets lonesome. - That's enough, David. The story about Bomba's a myth, there is no such person. I beg Monsieur's pardon, but if David says there is such a person as Bomba you may be sure that there is. Don't tell me you know who him too. No, but I know David. You don't think I'd lie to ya, do ya? Of course we don't, David. We just think that you, well, you heard so much about it from the natives that you really believe it. That's not good son, can't you see that? Well, I guess so, if you say so. It's Oto! Hi, what you doing today? Well, how'd you manage to train that little fellow, son? I didn't train him, he's. I'm afraid you'll get mad at me if I tell ya. Nonsense, why should I? Because he belongs to Bomba. He sends him to tell me when he's coming to see me. David. Go to Bomba, Oto. Tell him I can't play with him anymore. You really believe he's out there waiting for you, don't you, David? Yes, sir. But I'll try not to if you don't want me to. If there is such a boy, why don't you bring him here to meet us? I tried, but he doesn't like grownups. Suppose you try once more, but if he won't come to meet us tell him you'll never be able to see him again. Oh boy, maybe that'll do the trick! Come on, Oto! Ruth, we've got to send David to Cape Town and put him in a good boys' school. Being alone this way is forcing him to live too much in his imagination. You don't suppose there is such a person as Bomba, do you dear? Of course not. There are thousands of legends just like this one all over Africa. Babe left alone by dying parents. Raised by apes or wolves or woodchucks or something. All of them legends and all of them phony. No one follow, David? It wouldn't matter if they did. I backtracked like you showed me. David learn quick. Ah, anyone could do that. But I can't get the hang of this swinging business right. Bomba show. You watch. Hold tight. Way back. Push, watch. Okay. Hold tight, lay back, push. Ruth, we've got visitors! You're Paul Gordon? That's right. I'm Dr. Charles Langley. I've been doing some work at the Cairo Museum, ethnology. It's a pleasure, doctor. This is Mrs. Gordon. How do you do, Mrs. Gordon? How do you do? Mr. Higgins and Mr. Bolton, my very competent guides. - How are you? - Hello. Without them, I daresay I should never have found you. I suggest we get in out of this sun and I'll try to scare up a few refreshments. Not right now, thank you, Mrs. Gordon. I would like to discuss a little matter with your husband though that I think will interest him. Well, let's go inside. Recent seismograph records point to this district as the possible location of a long lost volcano. Hey. How's about going up that old volcano hill again today, Bomba? Too late today. Too far from David's home. Ah, please, Bomba, we could hurry. Hill not good now, make noise sometime. Thunder. Ah, I ain't scared of any little old noise. Animals scared. Bomba not like. I just thought maybe we could get another knife or something up there for my father. Bomba not find things for father. Father bad. He's not really bad, Bomba. It's just that he doesn't understand things like all grownups. Father put animals in cage. He thinks they're dangerous to people. That cat not hurt you. Well, I better get back on home. Our present location is about here and just there is the crater of Kulari. Yes, but there's nothing mysterious about Kulari. It's still active and charted on every map of Africa. Of course, but in Kulari's shadow and partially buried beneath it's lava flow I'm hoping to find our lost volcano. I' thought if anyone could tell us about it, you'd be the man, living with it right in your backyard so to speak. That area's practically inaccessible. I've never been in although I promised myself I'd explore it one of these days. Good, then that's settled. You may start outfitting a safari at once. Oh, I'm afraid not, sir. Well, you see, my wife and I planned a trip outside. It may be a foolish question, doctor, but what would be gained by finding this lost volcano? I have reason to believe, or at to least suspect, that the ruins of an ancient city lie buried beneath it. The remains of an old cultural development. If I am right, it would be the biggest find in a generation. I'd certainly like to help you, Dr. Langley, but I. You see, doctor, we have a young son and lately we've come to feel that this solitude is not good for him. He should be in a school with boys of his own age. Won't you change your mind and go with me to meet my father, Bomba? No. Please, Bomnba. Daddy doesn't believe there is any such person as you. Bomba not care what father think. Well then, I guess I won't see you anymore. Why you not come back, not like Bomba now? Well, my father won't let me unless I bring you home with me. Why don't you come back with me, please? One time men try and catch Bomba. Like animal. My father wouldn't do that. Father trap animals. Then I suppose we might as well say goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, it's been a lotta fun. I'll never forget you, Bomba, and I. Oh, gee whizz! Who are you? I am Nona. What you do here? That belong David, put it back. You want Bomba take? You not afraid, Bomba. Yes, I am, very much afraid. Why you here watching Bomba? To make sure that there is such a person. David's father thinks he is lying. David not lie, not know how. That's why I need these things, to show him, so he'll have to believe. Nona like little David? Very much. Bomba like David, Nona like David, Bomba like Nona. You mean I may go now? Go now, Nona good friend. Oh, hello, David. Come on in and meet these gentlemen, hmm? This is Dr. Langley, son. How do you do, David? How do you do, sir? And Mr. Higgins and Mr. Barton. - Hi, son. - Hello, David. Well, where's your friend Bomba? Didn't you bring him back with you? No, sir. He wouldn't come. Did you explain that this means you won't be able to see him again? Yes, sir, but he was afraid you'd put him in a cage. Like the animals. Looks like you're right about the school, Gordon. That certainly messes up my plans. David, I think you'd better go to your room and stay there until you're ready to admit that this whole thing is a mistake. Don't any of you believe I'm telling you the truth. I believe you, David. This Monsieur will have to admit that he's made a mistake. Nona. I followed you in the jungle. There is such a person as Bomba. I met him and talked to him. You what? Perhaps Monsieur will believe his eyes. These are his gifts from his friend. You. You mean he actually wears these things? Sure, Daddy. It'd be awful hard swinging through the trees on vines with shoes on and things. Reversion to type, aye, Gordon. A perfect tree dwellers wardrobe. The handle of this knife looks like it was made of gold. Yeah, it is. And those two big stones are emeralds or I'm an ostrich. There are no emeralds in Africa. It would be more accurate to say none of them found so far. Did your friend Bomba make this, son? No, sir, we found it. He took me back in the hills to a place where some people used to live. Are there any more such trinkets lying around? Yes, sir. Knives and spears, and bands for your arms. And some things kind of like crowns. Look at the inscriptions on there, Gordon. They all have stones on 'em like these? No, sir, some of them have red ones and some white like glass. Were there houses of any kind around where you found it, son? Yes, sir. Most of them were buried and there were some caves like. This sounds very much like our city of the lost volcano. Could you find your way back in there do you think? Sure, easy. But I promised Bomba I'd never show it to anyone else. As long as there's a way in I've no doubt you could find it, couldn't you? You forget, doctor, I'm taking David outside to school. But there's no need for that now that you know the jungle boy is a reality and no longer an hallucination. All the more reason to get David away from him. Out from under his influence. Swinging through the trees on vines. Gordon, you're passing up the opportunity of a lifetime. I realize that, doctor. But I won't have my son grow up to be some sort of ape man! Couldn't you take the boy in Mrs. Gordon so your husband can stay here? If my husband stays here, I stay with him. If I go out, we both go. It's always been that way with us. Aren't you overlooking the obvious solution? Fred and I are going back to civilization tonight. Why doesn't he come with us? Sure, your maid could go along to take care of him. You remember your manners now, David, don't you? And study hard too. Here we go. That a boy. Be a good boy, darling. - Bye bye. - Bye. So long, son. Goodbye, Daddy. Bye! I'm gonna miss him, Paul. It won't be for long, dear. I hope we're not making a mistake, sending him off alone with Nona. From what I've seen, she'll take better care of him than a squad of marines. He'll be all right. First of all, we'll make a list of the supplies we'll need. You were in this volcano country once, Fred. Which way does it lie from here? Oh, off to the right there about 20-25 miles. That must be a different one. The one I went to is way off that way. Yeah. Yeah, it must have been a different one. That's strange, the lights on the jeep just went out. That's nothing to worry about, Ruth. I often drive without lights when there's a full moon. Mr. Barton, did you know you'd gotten off the road? Sure, taking a shortcut. Perhaps it would be safer if we took the longer way, Monsieur. Leave everything to us, Miss, we know what we're doing. David. I seemed to misplace your jungle clothes. You gave 'em to me. Here. Mr. Barton, you can't get to the river landing this way. You'll wind up way back in the hills. Yeah, I know. Then we'll let you show us where that lost volcano is. I couldn't do that. I promised Bomba I wouldn't show it to anyone. There's lot of ways of making little boys forget promises like that. Monsieur Barton, I wish you would turn the car back and return to the station at once. Why don't you sit back and relax? You're in no spot to give orders. Tell your friend to stop the car, Monsieur! Yeah, yeah, sure, Bart. Bart, do what you she says, stop the car. She's not kiddin'. Okay, lady, I'll stop. Run, David, run! Relax and sit down, both of you. Nobody's gonna get hurt if you behave yourselves. Look, Monsieur, what is that? Stop her, Fred, before she gets back to the station! What wrong? Why men try shoot Nona? Oh, run, they'll kill both of us! Man gone, why he try kill? They're stealing little David, he and the other man. Stealing little David? He's in great danger, they may even kill him. Nona go tell father, Bomba go follow David. Men not hurt. Did you get her? I would have. Some sort of a human ape swung out of a tree, knocked me flat and then beat it. Bomba! You let him get away too? What could I do with this? Probably heading back to the station for help. So what, they can't outrun the jeep. Lets get started. Now there's a rough idea of what we need, Dr. Langley. I can supply most of it myself. If you'll excuse me, it's way past my bedtime. Good night, Mrs. Gordon. - Good night. - We won't be long, dear. Nona! What's happened, where's David? Those men, they've stolen David! What are you saying? Get a hold of yourself, Nona. Why should they want to kidnap David? They intend to make him lead them to the lost volcano, to the treasure. Call your men, Paul, get them on their trail! I sent the men back to the villages, all of them. I'll have to go alone. You're not going alone, Gordon. I'm responsible for those men being here. Where did you see them last? I could not describe the place, I'll go with you. You're in no condition for that sort of thing. They have David, Monsieur. I will take you to the place. Better try to get some sleep, kid. Gonna have a big day tomorrow. Yes, sir. It's sort of uncomfortable tied up this way. It's your own fault for trying to get away from us. It is about here that I jumped from the car. But the tire tracks continue on. Look, there's the print of a human foot. Bomba! He said he would follow to protect David. For a lad who's supposed to be half animal this Bomba seems a friend worth having. Yeah, yeah, don't rub it in, doctor. This way. David rest now. When sun come, we go to father. Do you think we're far enough away? Won't they find us? Not find, Bomba watch. Hey, what happened? What are you shooting at? I didn't shoot. Bart, snap out of it, the kid's gone. What happened? I don't know, something hit me from behind. I don't know what it was. It's been cut. Must be that monkey man, there's his footprint. They'll head back to the station and... No, they'll hole up for the night. We'll be waiting for 'em in the morning. David, wake up now. Put on. Bomba go high, see all safe. Don't be a fool. He knows the way to the lost volcano. Tie his ankles. Keep an eye on him, I'll get the jeep. Ruth, you and Nona better rest a while and then go back to the station. I couldn't, Paul, I'll be all right. Darling, this is too much for you. I know, but I couldn't stay alone not knowing what's happened to him. She's better off trekking along with us, Gordon. Come on. Listen. I thought I heard the sound of a motor starting. It is a motor! And not far from here. This is their camp. They must have been here a few minutes ago. It's David's, Paul! What have they done to him? - What have they done? - Easy, Ruth, easy. We know he's still with them at least and nothing's happened to him. We also know they are not very far ahead, and we are wasting time! Yes, Paul, hurry! So you've finally come to, have you? How would you like it if I dragged you in out of the sun? Bomba like. Suppose you tell me where the kid is. All right, you can probably lead us to the volcano as well as he can, maybe better. Bomba not take you to volcano. You're not in very good shape to refuse, now are you? If you kill Bomba, you never find volcano. You think it's hot out here in the sun? Wait till my partner gets back. You'll find out what real heat is. Sounds like the jeep's comin'. It won't be long now. No, not long. Barton, Barton! Barton! Barton, help! Help, Barton! Barton, help! Help! Barton! Barton! Barton! Barton! What happened to you? Where's the jungle boy? Did you let him get away? He set a python on me. Oh now, come on. Pull yourself together and tell me the truth. What actually did happen? I am telling you the truth. Python, dropped out of a tree on me. Where'd it go? I don't see any snake. Nevermind that snake. Let's get on the track of the ape man. We won't have to trail him. He couldn't have gone to the station or I would have seen him. Come on. How are we gonna get past him to get back to the station, Bomba? Not go station, go my place, safer. We could go faster on the vines, Bomba, and throw 'em off the trail. Lose trail soon, cross water. Judging by the tracks, the four of 'em are still together. What have you found? Looks like someone was tied up and then cut loose. That doesn't tell us much. No. The best thing we could do is to keep on following the jeep tracks. Come. Let's take a swim first. No, not now. Come back! Come and catch me. Go back now. Not yet, Bomba, please. No, David, look! David, go, swim! Bomba, Bomba! It's like the terrain got to rough for the jeep and they've gone on afoot. And I can only find the tracks of the two men. Then we'll follow their tracks, lead the way, Gordon. Following tracks through this sort of growth is a mighty slow process. But we can't stop now, Paul, we've got to find them! Of course, dear, but my suggestion is that instead of following tracks we spread out, cover as wide a ground as possible. Right, but we better stay within hailing distance. Yeah. David. David! Doctor! Yes, yes, Nona. I just saw the Monsieur and they have little David, and they were going to the jeep! Go tell Mr. Gordon, I'll follow them! Monsieur Gordon! Which way do we go from here? Answer him. Up through those mountains. That doesn't look like a lost volcano to me. The lost one's this side and over to the south. Hang on to him, I'll get the jeep. There's another lake up there and it's too rocky for a jeep, maybe... Maybe we'd better walk. We'll ride as far as we can. Every little bit helps, come on. You're wrong, Barton. You're not going anywhere. Come on over here, David. Yes, sir! Get down, get down! Paul, the jeep! Bomba! Oh, I was afraid they'd kill you like Monsieur Langley! Not hurt much. Take care of him, Ruth, I'll follow the jeep. Not follow jeep. But they've got David. Jeep go long way to lake. Bomba know short way. What about Dr. Langley? We'll have to come back for him later. What's wrong with that water out there? Looks like it's boiling. Bomba says it is boiling. It comes up like that from the bottom. Nevermind the water. How do we get up there where we're going? I've only been in here once, but I guess I can find my way in again. You'd better. Yes, sir. Paul, that lake looks dangerous. David not go that way, go there. Radiator's still hot, they can't be far away. You wait, Bomba follow. Hey kid, how much farther is it to these caves? Oh, it's quite a little ways up there. Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, mister, you're not supposed to bother those things. No, just watch. Emeralds, must be worth a fortune. Don't try it kid, we like this sample. Rifle's jammed, it's useless. Men gone, we follow. Well, that's a pretty tough climb. Ruth, you and Nona had better stay here. If you can make it, so can we. Darling, look at those rocks. They're almost straight up, I... Ruth, you and Nona get back to the valley. What are you gonna do? You can't fight a volcano. Don't argue, run, both of you! Paul, look! We gotta get out, Paul. And David, he can't get out! We'll all be buried alive! Easy, Ruth, easy. Bomba, can you get the women back to the valley? Bomba would not leave David. Of course not, we couldn't. Not leave David, we go now. Bart, let's get out of here while we still got a fighting chance. Not yet. There's probably more buried in here. More bracelets and gold. Oh, use your head. What good is gold if we can't get out with it? What's the good of getting out if you don't take the gold with you? Come on, give me a hand if you're in such a rush. Were you lying about those caves and all that jewelry? No, sir, honest, I've been in there. There's one farther up if I can still get into it. - You better get into it. - Use some sense, Bart. Suppose that volcano's... The volcano's through erupting and the show's over, now let's get going! We'll never get out of here now even if we find David. One way out, up high. Rocks not fill it. They're still alive, David with them. How do you know? Footprints. We not far behind. What's the matter, kid? I'm used to leaning on the rock. That's about halfway knocked off. I don't know if I can still make it. You can still make it, go ahead, kid. Maybe he can, but I can't. I won't even try it. Hold it, friend. We started out this thing together. We're gonna finish it together. You crazy, you don't need me from here on. You're gonna go along that ledge and find out if it's safe for me. Easy does it now! Go on, toss that rifle over the side. All right, now the revolver. All right, now let's follow the kid. You wait. Men, look up! Bomba! Throw rifle over side. Throw rifle! Back up. Keep hands high on wall. Over there. Keep 'em up. Oh, baby. Not go that way. Go this way. Come on, follow him. David all right? - Fine. - Good. Bomba and David lead way, you follow. Come. Don't be scared, Mom. Dr. Langley was right. Not take, not belong you. Come, not much time. Hands off, Barton, let's go. Just a few. Just a few won't matter. On your way! Why not Gordon, they're no good to dead men. They're no good to you for the same reason. Come on. Paul, what's become of Barton? He's not here, he's gone back for the jewels. Keep going, I'll get him. Go back, Barton, go back! Paul, Paul! It's all right, Madame, he is safe! Come. There's a way out, Paul. Bomba's found a way out. Bomba, look. Bomba, Bomba, look! Higgins! You can't go in there. Higgins, hurry, man, quick! Higgins, look, man, look! Hurry up, man, get outta there! Higgins, get outta there, quick! Higgins! Station that way, not far. Aren't you coming with us? David know way, Bomba go his home. But you'll come back again soon, won't you? David will miss you, Bomba. Bomba miss David too. Perhaps Monsieur Bomba will come to the house sometime to see his friends. Yes, good friends now, Bomba like. What did he say? He said next time maybe you'll believe David.
