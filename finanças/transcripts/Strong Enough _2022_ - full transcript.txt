He's got early flight this evening. There's some bubblegum chewer in North Dakota. -All right, we'll get it done. -His name's Alec. - Hey, Alec. Sam. - Pleasure to meet you. - I am so sorry I'm late. - Don't worry about it. We'll have you out of here in no time. Thanks, Blake. Good looking out. Wish these things weren't so fast, but be assured, my focus is on you today. We are so glad to be here to witness it. Thank you for involving us in your world records. All Shane. Oh, I don't know about all that. It's good to see how we do under pressure. My unofficial manager. Hey look, I want to get this on our social. -You good with that? -Sure. All right, cool. Hey, everybody, it's your main man, Shane, live here at my gym, the RCC, and I'm with the incomparable Sam Johnson and the World Record Federation today. -Give a shout out, guys. -Hey guys. Getting ready to break some records, right? That's what we're here for. That's right, we're going to shatter them right here. We're going to get at it at the top of the hour, so check back in with us. - You okay if I start? - Yes. I just have a few paperwork items to go over. Make sure we have the correct names and exercises listed. Your full name is Samantha Aiden Johnson, -is that correct? -Yeah. Love the name Aiden. Thanks. It's my dad's. I bet he's really excited to hear about this today. Uh, he actually passed away last year. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Don't worry about it. You know, one of the perks of my job is that I really get to learn about some interesting and new things. Uh, a lot of crazy things, too, but I won't get into that. Uh, but I've really enjoyed getting to know your sport. How long have you been doing it? About four years now. And were you an athlete before or something? Uh, gymnastics growing up, -some bodybuilding. -That's awesome. Let me sort out the details. I got this. Sam, stay in the headspace. We have to lock in soon. All right? I'll let you know if you need to sign anything. -All right. -Okay. Thank you. -I didn't mean-- -It's fine. You didn't know. -Were they close? -Oh, yeah, very. But she's good. She's ready for this. -All right. What do you got? -Just right here. All right. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I pass this to you? - Yeah. How was class this morning? Brutal as always, you know. How are you feeling about this one? - We'll see. - Oh, you got it. Do you have to? I'm getting a free month out of this, so I'm getting it all. Just a month? So this is the one, over 1,800 pounds in a minute? How many reps are you trying to do? Ten. -Where does this one fit? -Less. Is it still five movements in 30 minutes? - That's the goal. - Okay. I told her she should try and get some money out of this. Yeah, she at least talked to Shane about a free membership. And for, like, a year. It's a mock competition. Just testing my limits. Yeah, come on, Sam, what do you get out of this? You get a sponsorship with someone? No way. I want in. I don't want to jinx it. Plus, you didn't train a lot harder. That's low, man. This is going to be awesome. You know, you guys don't have to stay for this. -Well it's too late now. -I wouldn't miss this. Thanks. -Oh, hey. -Oh, thanks. Mom. -Hey, Mom. -There she is! My baby, the record breaker. We haven't started yet. You haven't? Late start. Pretty soon, though. - Good luck, Sam. - Thanks. Are you still warmed up? Yeah. Oh, hey. Look what I found. Did you go through my box of things? Things? These are not things. And yes. Yes, I did. If I can't be there, then I want to remember all the other records you broke. -Oh, my gosh. -I am so proud of you. Everything you pushed through this year. I know your dad is, too. He is smiling on you. - Yeah. - No, he is. Uh, got a call with a new sponsor. Should, uh, open some doors if I can do this, Maybe bring in a little money, at least help with comp fees. -That's good, right? -Yeah. It's not official yet, but it should be soon. Good for you. You put that money to good use. Is Charlie there? -No. -Hmm. I understand. But you know what? I will be your lifeline. If you need anything, just call me. Will do. Your dad would say, -"Go break some records." -"Go break some records." Yeah. Thanks, Mom. -Love you. -I love you. Bye. Looks like you haven't started yet. Cool. Cool, I'm glad I didn't miss it. Um, you're looking good, you're looking ready. What? Do you remember the last thing you said to me? How about, "Hey, thanks for coming." How about, "Hey, I didn't mean what I said." The only reason you're here is to save face. -I'm not here to save face. -Okay. I thought you'd be done by now, but-- Uh, cool. You know? You got this. You can totally do this. -Oh, permission. -I'm just saying-- If you wanted to talk, you should have called me back. Why are you doing this now? Like nothing's going on. -I've been texting you. -You know I hate texting. What do you want me to do, Sam? We don't live together anymore. We cannot pick this up where we left off. - I'm just trying-- - No. Hey, Charlie. How you've been? -Sam, you good? -Yeah. Okay. All right, a few more minutes. I'm going to need your signatures. Okay, yeah. - Be there in a sec. - All right. Oh, and I like the adjudicator. He wants to review a few things when you're ready. Okay. Yeah, I'll be over in a minute. All right. We're getting close. You never get Fridays off. Yeah, well... I did today. But I'll go if you want me to. Do what you want. Look, your dad would want you to have all the support. I want to stay. Cheer you on. So, are you here for me or him? Sam. Signatures. Here and here. Make it official. Bye, Sam. Good luck! - Good luck, Sam. - See ya. -Good luck, Sam. -Thanks, man. See ya. Did you give him paperwork? Yes. Toxicology report. She's clean. Right. Okay, great. I'll add this to the notes. Fantastic. Okay. Just a few things I wanted to go over before we begin. Can you turn down the music for me, please? We will be starting on the hour. So, in about ten minutes. Sam, you'll have one minute to complete each record. Uh, starting first with burpee pull ups. Second will be wall ball squats. Third are handstand push ups. Those are fourth. toe to bar is third. Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Third is toe to bar. Fourth is handstand push ups.

O-- okay, great. Uh, and counting each rep to make sure that they're done to completion. I will also be reminding us of the previous world records and what needs to be accomplished for the new record. -Sound good? -Sounds good. - Yeah. - You ready? Great.

What's your playlist? -Uh, jam sesh for that. -All right. Jam sesh. All right. It's got a vibe to it. All right, burpee pull ups are first. So, we wanna get some nice gap pulls. Let's do some kips. We're going to spot our bars, keep our nice wide stance. We're going to cut down on our turnover time this time, all right? Hey, Sam, this guy has something for ya. - Samantha Johnson? - Yeah. - You've been served. - Hey, what's going on? - Hey, hey! No. - Hey. I gotta give it to her. I gotta give it to her. Sam, you've been served. No, this is not how this works. Hey, no. Settle down. How the heck did this guy even get in here? He-- he said he had something urgent for Sam. Served? Sam? - Sam. - Okay, Charlie. Okay. Sam, I can explain this. - Sam? - Sam. Charlie, hold up, hold up, hold up. - Hold on. Sam. - Sam. Sam, I can explain this. What was that? Shane, this is none of your business. It's taking place in my gym. It's my business. Okay, man. - Let me explain, please. - Hey. Hey, come on. Sam, I'm sorry, That wasn't supposed to happen. Can you open this? I need to talk to you. I don't think she wants to talk to you, dude. Give her space here. Come on. - Don't touch me. - Come on. - Sam! - Charlie. - I-- I-- - Let's go. Come on, roll out.- Is that why you came? So you could watch my reaction? - No! - All right. No! I said don't touch me. You're overstaying your welcome. Sam, I'm so sorry, I-- I promise I had no idea it was going to be-- be this fast. I-- I thought I had time to stop it. You filed for divorce? It wasn't supposed to happen like this. You need to step back. This isn't what I wanted, okay? - Come on. - Don't touch me! Charlie, let's go. I said don't touch me! That's my wife. You're standing inside of my gym, and I said you need to go! You asshole. I can't believe you. Hey, hey. Sam. Sam! Sam, stop! Look, I know it's a lot. It's a lot. Okay? Let's take a moment. Come on, breathe. Let's remember the big picture. Everything that you put into this. Let's not walk away from what you're about to do. I can go tell Alec that we need a delay or something and that will be fine, but I need you in the right headspace. -He won't have time for that. -Charlie. Look, there's a lot of rage. I get it. Trust me. If anybody understands, I do. But there's a big opportunity on the table in there for you, Right? World records. Maybe sponsorship, who knows? We wanted to see what you could do. We wanted to push you past your limits. You're the fittest you ever been, right? We wanted to test that. So, let's test it. Come on, you leaving right now is not going to change whatever's happening between you two. Nobody controls this moment but you. I want you to remember what you're doing this for. Now, I'll get it if you say you can't. But... All right. Yeah. Okay. All right. Game on. Guys, I-- I didn't mean-- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

Are we planning for about a minute rest? Are you feeling good with that time? -Yeah. -How are the hands? -Did they rip? -All good. Okay, good. She's ready. - Let's move on. - Okay, great. Come on. Come on. Way to go, Sam! Wall ball squats are up next. Sam, I-- I never intended that to happen today. -I would never-- -We said we'd talk about it. -We did talk about it. -No, we thought about it.

We're doing good in terms of time, yeah. Look, I'm going to go. After four years, this is where we end up? We can't get into that right now, Sam. You got to get back. I can't pretend this isn't happening. What do you want me to say? Why? Tell me why. Because we've gone different directions. Look at you. Look at where you are now. You got us started in this direction. We do this together. You love this. I know. And now it's your thing. - I'm doing this for both of us. - Really? You fight more for a trophy than you do for us. That is not fair. You know how hard this last year has been. I have been fighting for us, and you should be right here with me. I know, and I tried to tell you to slow down, but I can't go there because it's like an attack. This is our dream. This is your dream, Sam. People get divorced all the time. So? It's not like we have kids or a mortgage that keeps us together. Do you hear what you're saying? We don't need kids or a house to keep us together. This should be about us. Am I not enough for you? Yeah. Maybe you should go. Hey, welcome back, Sam! Let's go. Let's get back into the zone. Look, this next one is a little bit harder, but we knew this going in. The first two were just warmups. - We're going for 42, right? - Yeah, or more. The last world record was 41 in one minute. All right, we got about 20 minutes. -You good with that? -Yeah. Hey. You got this. For one minute, you're going to go all out and you can do anything for one minute, you hear me? -Yeah. Yeah. -Hey. You good? Yeah. Okay. All right. She's good. Let's go. Come on, Sam. Come on, come on. World record number three coming up! -Halfway there. -World record number three. Give it up. - Three out of six. - You got this, Sam. Hey, here we go. Previous record is 41 touches. All right, Sam. Come on. You got this. This is you. It's all you. You ready, Sam? Okay, timer in... ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, - One. Two. - There you go. Nice. Yep. - Yep.

Oh, she's so strong. - Above and beyond. - Hey, what happened? -You good? -Yeah. - What do I do? - All right. - Hey, Blake, go get me the kit. - Okay. And can you turn it down a little bit? - Yeah. - How you feel? - Good. Yeah. - Yeah, you look good up there. Thanks. You don't even break a sweat. Hey, come on, let's take care of that. I gotta say, Sam, when I saw what was coming today, I wasn't prepared for it. This is inspiring. Hey, look, we're going to just take a few minutes here, okay? We won't take long. All right. Take whatever time you need. All right. Great. Sam, when you're done, just show me your hand. Oh, those are the worst. All right, thank you. Gotta trim the skin. You want to take off your ring? Ah, I'll just trim around it. Yeah, but you got to put tape on. Yeah. Did Charlie leave? -Yeah. -Are you all okay? I mean... -Are you safe, Sam? -Oh, yeah. Nothing like that. Charlie can't even smash a spider. No, we've-- we've been going at it for a while, and... obviously, the separation hasn't helped. Yeah, for what it's worth, I don't know if you know, but Marie and I were separated. No way. You guys are the perfect couple. Fooled you. -I mean, it was a while ago. -But you're together now. We worked it out. You know? Took a lot out of both of us. It was a struggle. And I love her. There's that. Love fueled us. Just like you're going to need some fuel after all this. It's going to take a lot more than a protein shake to save my marriage. Come on, you know what I mean. Your dad. What's something that he would say to you in the midst of all this? Huh? He always knew I wanted to be an athlete - or something growing up. - Mm-hmm? So he'd always say, "Somebody's got to do it, so it might as well be you." So matter of fact. And it will be you. So, let's keep that. You use that for later. -For social? -No, for the news. -You didn't. -What do you mean? A member of my gym is a world class record-holding sponsored athlete. You better believe I'm calling the news. You jerk. Hey, look, we only got a few more minutes, okay? So let's do some dynamic stretches. Yeah. Stay warm, stay loose. You're taking too much of a break over here. Don't tell me what to do. I'll get your mats up for you. -Hey, is she okay? -Yeah, she's good. So is the goal The Games? Well, that's where we anticipate her to leave a mark. Right, world's fittest person or something, right? -Yeah. -She's never been? She killed at the opening last year. She moved right through the semifinals. How did she do? Well, that's when her dad got really sick. Well, he died right before it started. She went straight home and never got on stage. All right, let's do it. Clock's ticking. Handstand push ups are next. It's one of your strongest sections. It's gonna be a walk in the park for you. All right, previous world record is 12. We're looking for 13 complete handstand push ups. That means your head must come all the way down to the mat, arm's fully extended, or it won't count. - Okay, are you ready? - Yeah. All right, timer in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. - Go, Sam. - Here we go. Here we go. - One. Two. - That's it. That's it. Let's go. It's okay. - Right back up. - You got this. -Three. -Feel your balance. Reset. Reset. I'm going again. My balance is off. - It's okay. - Way off. Hey, look, this is easy for you, Remember? Hey, it's okay. You got this. All right? 30 minutes, five records. Doesn't matter how many times I try, yeah? Right. Let's go again. All right, but you don't have -as much time left after this-- -I know. I know. -I'm doing the math. -Okay. - This is fine, right? - Absolutely. As long as you're okay with it. - Yeah. Let's go. - Okay. So, Sam, you ready? - Yeah. It's good. - Okay, great. Timer in... ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. -One. Two. -You go, Sam. -Sam. -Three. Good balance. - Good. Good! - Nice. -That's good. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Take time to reset, you're at 45 seconds. Killing it, Sam. Come on, Sam. Focus. That's it. -Make it look easy. -Ten. -Nice. -Not even against the wall. - Not even halfway. - Good. Good. -Yes! -A little faster if you can. - 13, 14. - That's good. - Keep that back. - 30 seconds. - 15. - Come on, come on! - Yes! Come on, keep going. - Good, Sam. -17 -Strong in your core. -Strong in your core. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's okay. It's okay. - Breathe, come on. - 20 seconds. - Good. Good. - 18. - Good. Keep going. 19. 20! You got it, Sam! You got it! 21! This is amazing! - Last push, last push. - 22. Post stretch. Come on, come on. Three. -24. -Three, two, one. - 24. - Yes! - Yes! - Oh, my gosh! How many was that, Alec? - 24. - 24. Doubled the world record. All right. All right, all right, all right. Sam. Sam, you all right? Sam? Hey. Breathe. Just breathe. Did you fuel up okay yesterday? Maybe you overdid a little with the water. I don't know. Probably. How much time? Hm, about seven or eight more minutes. So do we add weight to the bar? Less reps or do we take some off to do fewer? We're at 185 already. It's already pretty heavy. I don't think we should go heavier. Cycling knees isn't your strongest. Why is this last again? Because you asked for it. We're pushing a lot of shoulders. That was stupid. Why didn't you stop me? Well, I tried. Didn't know you were going to go all out on the handstands. We're going to need you at 110% for this next one. You currently hold four world records. One more to go. Just a minute. I just need a minute. All right, you got your minute. You ready for this, Sam? I know you are. Bar's been chalked and set at 185. We're gonna go ten times. Previous world record is set at lifting 785 pounds. 10 reps at this point will be 850 pounds. You ready, Sam? - Yeah. - Okay. Timer in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. - One. - Nice! Great lock off, Sam. - Deep breath. - You got this. That's two! 45 seconds. Form is perfect, Sam. Come on, Sam. Dig deep. You got this. Come on. Nice. Come on, come on, come on! - Good. - Great lock off, Sam, good job. Nice! 30 seconds. Less than 30 seconds. Make it lighter. We got to start over. All right, we're going to start over. -Let's reset the clock. -Set it to 150. - You want it at 150? - Yes. -That'll have to be... -She'll have to do 12 reps at that weight. -12 reps are good with that? -I know. - 12 reps are good? - Yeah. Let's go. Ah, hey, Blake, can you go out there and just tell them to hold a beat, give us a minute. They can wait inside, but they got to be in the corner. Okay, you guys only have about two minutes left to plan, okay? All right, this is going to feel a lot lighter, so you're going to want to power through it, -but just save it. -Yeah, I got it. Can we roll camera? Blake, I need some water for her. Can we get a water bottle, please, quickly? -Thank you. -Thanks. Last record. I cannot talk to sponsors right now. Blake, can you take this? Wait, no, I'll call them back. - Can someone get that? - What? No. Just-- Look. We got to move, okay? We only have a minute. - Okay, let's go. - All right. -Okay, you ready? -Yeah. - All right, here we go. - Let's go. -Hey, roll on this. -On it. Timer in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. - That's good. - One. - Good. - Let's go. That's light for you, Sam. Keep a good rhythm. - Seven seconds in. - Two. - Great. - That's it, Sam. - Come on. That's it. - Looking good. - 10 seconds in. - Light drive. - Three. - Good luck. Come on, Sam! - Big hips here. - Four. - Good. - Good, good. - Perfect form. - 20 seconds in. Keep going, Sam. You got this. You got this. Come on, Sam, you got this, go, go, go. Five. Good. Okay, you're halfway. 30 seconds. Six. Come on, come on, Sam! Come on, focus. You got this! Light drive. Light drive. - Come on, Sam. - 20 seconds. Coming up on it so good. - Good lockout. - Push it. Seven, 15 seconds. 10 seconds left. Come on, come on, Sam, dig deep. Home stretch. - Nice push. - Come on, come on! - Five, four, three... - Hey, Sam. - One. - Time! - Dang it. - Sam! Okay, it's all good, it's all good. You don't need 12. Okay, whoa! Hey. Give it over to the floor. Thank you, Blake. We can cut. All right, take a minute. I'm fine. I'm good. - Amazing work, Sam. - Power through it. Definitely didn't hold back, not one bit. Credible feat. Wrap it up. Wrap it up, yup. Sam, easy. Good job, Sam. You came, you fight, it was a battle and you still won. - No, I didn't. - Yes, Sam, you did. You made four records in a half hour. That's probably a record in and of itself. The goal was five, it had to be five in 30 minutes. Hey, but you did four and that's already in the history books, right? Until somebody beats it, it needed to be five. Don't beat yourself up, okay? Hey, Shane, it's the sponsors again. Hey, look, they don't even know that we started so late. They probably think we've been done for a while, now. What I'm saying is, is that you still have sponsorship in your cards. You shop for the moon and you cleared the atmosphere. I'm going to tell them how amazing you were. This is Shane. Aha, yep, she was incredible. Uh-huh. You did great. You gave it everything you got. Okay? You were so close. I'm sorry. I know it's not what you wanted, but what you did today, only lead athletes can do. I'm serious, I get to travel all over the world and see amazing world records get set, but rarely don't get to see somebody push their body like you did today. You accomplished four world records in 30 minutes. 15 years, I've never seen an athlete like her before. Thank you. Yeah, she's right here. -Sam, can you chat? -Yeah. Hello. Hey, Shane, so I just have a few certificates and awards to give her, -but when you're ready... -Yeah. We could also wait for the news crew. -That might be cool. -No, I understand. But whenever you're ready. For sure. Tell you the same thing. Hi there. Excuse me. Brenda Featherstone from News Two. - Hi, Brenda. - How are you? -Good. -Sam, congratulations. Such an impressive feat. Do you think after the interview you could give us some B-roll of you moving around a bit? Yeah, like maybe some cooldown. Her on a bike or stretching or something. Okay. Are there awards or any commemorations? That's fine. -Okay. -Aha, yeah. I'm just going to set up over there and come by when you're ready. -Okay? -Okay. Thank you. Hey, look. It's not the end of the world, okay? Just take a moment, splash some water on your face, drink some recovery drink or something. -Shane, I just-- You are a gifted athlete. You should be competing in the games and they know that. That's why they're still going to provide all the gear that you're going to need for it. An official sponsorship wasn't a guarantee, -so it really doesn't matter. -It mattered to me. We need to get you on a bigger stage. That's where it matters. So, let's work towards that, okay? For my comp, we learned a lot. Now, we know what we need to work on. I'm so sorry, Shane. Hey, what are you apologizing for? I should've been able to do this. - It should have been easy. - No, no, no, no, no! Nobody ever said it was supposed to be easy. It's painful. If it's not painful, then you're not working hard enough. We got four wins. Let's celebrate that. Keep your head up. Sam. How do you prepare for the intensity of the sport? I show up six days a week, focus on nutrition and recovery. And how long have you been doing it? About four years now. More competitively the last two. So, some have said that the heavy impact on the body isn't healthy. What do you think? It all comes down to form. Uh, that's why I've got Shane here to watch my technique, make sure I'm moving safely. Form is everything. -Any injuries today? -Uh, little hand hair. How does it feel to be a world record holder? It really hasn't hit me yet, um... I know I set four world records today, but I think I'm still kind of coming down from it. Yeah, you were struggling a little bit on the last one. What was going through your mind? Everything. Um. Um, I think on the previous movement I came out a little too hot, used a little too much energy going into this last one. So, switching gears here, I understand your husband got you into this. Uh, yeah, he, um-- Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. Hold on a second. Could you restate the question in your answer? -Oh, yeah. -Okay, great. Keep-- keep rolling. Keep rolling. Um, my husband actually got me started in this. He-- he was my first coach. Um... He was actually in an accident a few years ago and hurt his neck and had to step back. Hm, that's too bad. So, now you're the competitor in the relationship, but that's great that he's there to support you. Who else supports you? Uh, my dad was my ultimate cheerleader before he passed. Uh, definitely my mom. Um, Shane here. Uh, it's just an awesome community to be a part of. Great, okay. Uh, great. I-- I think we got it. Um, could we see Sam being awarded and maybe get some movements on the bike - or something like that? - Absolutely. Let's go with the awards first. Alec here has a plan to catch. - Okay. - So we'll do that and then we'll grab a few quick shots. Okay, thanks. You got this? Okay. On behalf of the World Record Federation, it brings me great joy to honor you today, Sam, on your accomplishments. The most toe to bar in one minute, Sam Johnson. Good job, Sam. Good job. Come on, come on. You're great. I got a plane to catch. You did an amazing job today. - Thank you. - Be proud. All right, thanks guys, see ya. Bye. Have a safe flight. Shane, I will put all of these on a drive for you. Got some killer shots, you're gonna love them. My man. Can't wait. Anytime. You're champion a today. Well done. - Love you. - Love you too. -Bye. -Call me when you're done. - Yeah. - Thanks, Monica. - Cooldown? - Yeah. I just-- Yeah, I just wanna see some action. You can feel free to look in the camera anytime. Oh, sorry, sorry. Make it look like you're working hard a little bit. Come on. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Appreciate it. - Cool. Watch for us tomorrow night. Yes, looking forward to it. - Thank you. - Hey, Sam, you can't just let a banana take care of you -after all of that. -I'll eat more later. Hey, Shane, I'm about to head out, do you need anything else? -No, I think we're good. -Okay. Oh, actually I can clean up that bar real quick. - I'll get it. - You sure? Yeah. All right, okay. See ya. Be safe getting home, Blake. Oh, don't want you to forget this. What a jerk thing to do. So? - So. - You're going to party? Night on the town? I'm going to go home. You got a lot of nice merch coming away. Yay, more tops and coupon codes. -All yours if you want them. -Nah, I'm good. Don't forget to take your certificates, mount them on your wall or you can leave them here if you like. -Sure. -Wait, really? Yeah, put them on the wall over there or something. I can't take them, I mean they're yours. - Come on, Sam. - Whatever. You can borrow them. You know you want to. Post those bragging rights on your social. -I appreciate that. -And go home. I'm going to clean up and then I'll lock it down. I don't think I should leave you by yourself. Don't pity me. Seriously. Go home to your family. I'll see you tomorrow morning? Yeah. You sure you're going to be okay? All right. Shane, thank you for today. For everything. I was proud of you, Sam. I mean... You power through in the midst of all that stuff happening, it's not easy. It's in our fiercest battles that we realize what matters most. I saw you doing a lot more than just gaining world records today. I saw your heart. It's like the gladiators of old would say, "Let me win. And if I cannot win... let me be brave in the attempt." -Night. -Night. Sam. -Hi, Mom. I've been waiting for you to call. -I tried to call earlier. -I saw. Janine next door is texting me every five minutes. Did you do it? Uh, I got four. Ah, that's amazing. My baby, the record breaker. You're a pro. I'm not a pro, Mom. What's the matter? I couldn't-- I can't-- I didn't get it. What do you mean? I-- I thought I could get all of them. I was so close. That's okay. You did your best. Wait. What? What is it? Charlie. He let me know this time. He's done. Oh, honey. I just feel like, I let everybody down. Oh, no, no, no. Hey! You didn't let anyone down. No one. Hey, look at me. Look at me. You have worked so hard to get where you are. You have nothing to prove to anybody. You are so strong. It's not your job to carry the whole world. This is about you, nobody else. And you are enough. It's going to be okay. Hey. It's going to be okay. Figured you'd be hungry. I figured you'd still be here. Is that okay? The usual. Shakes and a melt. Four. That's not bad. Four world records. Yeah. That's four more than I have. They were out of the spicy fries. I had to go over to the one on State. I think I saw Dale there. Dale moved months ago. Huh. Maybe it wasn't Dale. Look, the other day we argued and divorce came up, and the next day I-- I was upset and I made a decision. But it wasn't supposed to happen like that. -What a coincidence. -I came here to talk. I didn't know that guy was coming. Then, how did he know where to find me and to come here at the same time as you? They ask where you spend your time. Please. Everything is here for you. Work, your clients. Your whole life has been about this for months. Of course I said here. And it just happened to be today. I didn't plan an attack on you, if that's what you're asking. Do you resent me? Because I'm here and you're not? No. I don't belong here anymore. -I don't fit in. You know that. -Because you don't want to. -Because I-- -Chris is here three days a week after his shoulder surgery. Tyson is here five with his knee. I'm not those guys. They're not coming in to be champions. I get that, okay? And I wish I could throw weight around like I used to, I do, but I can't. -I think you resent me for it. -It's not true. You put in three times more effort than you ever did. I can't do that. All the time, all the effort, you're pushing everyone away, all the important people, so that you can be at the top. You clearly don't get it. I can't control much of what happens in life, but here, I can. Really? You know, I wanted to quit last year. Why not? Why not quit? Then what the hell is all this for? So, this is worth it? Pushing everyone aside for this? Maybe if my dad were still here or you were still doing this, I wouldn't be going so hard. Do not hold this over my head. I'm doing this for you, for everyone. Not that it seems to matter after today. Why? Because you didn't get a few more - gimmicky world records? - No. You should not be worried about records. -I know! -Sam, you don't need world records to prove that you can do this. I just wanted you to be proud of me. I am proud of you. -Don't bullshit me. -I'm not. We were supposed to do this together. We were supposed to open a gym and go until our bodies broke down. -And I beat you to it. -No, you gave up. -You left. -So did you. After my injury, I tried to get back into it, but I couldn't-- I couldn't keep up. And you treated me like dead weight. So after your dad, I thought maybe she'll let me in. But you didn't. You just kept coming back here. So, I made a choice for you. Cut me off so that you can be free to follow your dream. You don't get to make that decision for me. I really, really wanted the wins today. Not just for the records. I thought it would be a new start for us. I don't want to do it alone. You're going to be a pro, Sam. You don't need me. I do. It broke on the clean and jerks. You could have bought this from a candy machine. Yeah. I wish I could have seen you at the end. I threw up on the handstand pushups. That blows. I'm so sorry, Sam. - Wait. Uh. - Oh, right. -Thanks. -Yeah, no. Better take it out so it doesn't stink up and joint. Shane'll appreciate that. Are you staying at Paul's still? Yeah, yeah. -Are you stepping out? -Ah, no. -I've gotta get mu stuff-- -Ah, okay. Well. -Good night. -Night. -Good night. -Night. 12.
