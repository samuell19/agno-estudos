Whoa! Now, that's a fine animal! Oh, yeah. Great stud, I bet. Now, the real advantage of being here today at Atlantic city racecourse to bring you the weather is that we've got the real thing. No boards, no mats, no pretty computer graphics. Uh-uh. The real thing. We got the real sun, as I predicted. We've got the real blue skies, as I predicted. Heck, we even got real horses, as I predicted. [Laughter] And speaking of predictions, hey, we even got a real winner. Ooh! This is Taylor worth, channel 5 news, Philadelphia, and I'll see you at 11:00. And we're clear. [Crowd talking] Ladies' day at the races.

Number 7, moving marcelle, to show. Come on, ned, at least bet him to win. Thank you. Hi. $40, number 3, my Charlie's angel, to win, please. Thank you. My gambling fund's a little low. Gambling fund? Gambling fund? Yes. Ned, what happened to you? What happened to the kid who bet his father's golf clubs on Cindy brownell's bra size? Hey, remember when I bet my scholarship money you'd flunk out before midterms? Yeah. What happened? Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. I settled down. Come on, pumpkin. Ned's actually a terrific guy, except he's lost his edge. When we were 11, he decided we should get mohawks. I shaved my head. He laughed for a month. You see this 50? And you see that 50? Yeah. They're not the same. They're not? No. This is 3 days of nursery school to me. And what's that? Champagne for 2? Silk panties for Mona. Mona? Do I know Mona? No. I haven't mentioned her. You're buying silk panties for a girl you haven't even mentioned to me? Ned, it's not important. Don't worry about it. There is no Mona. Taylor? Lizbette. Don't sweet-talk me. How are you? How should I be? You asked Wendy out, my own roommate. I know. You work Tuesday nights. Don't touch me. She said no. Well, of course she did. See? No harm done. He is my hero. A hero should accomplish something. I mean, what has Taylor accomplished? We are happily married men. With curfews. Yeah. I'd rather be like Taylor. Taylor doesn't know it yet, but he'd rather be like us. You should see him with my family. He really soaks it up. Now, that's what he really wants. He just doesn't know it yet. Hey, I'm a shrink. I know these things, right? I'm worried about him. Did you get a load of her legs? Yes. Don't you understand? He is dumping her! Taylor is stuck in a very destructive pattern. They hit the 2-month Mark, and he is running. It's classic. Reject them before they reject you. No. No woman is ever going to reject Taylor. That's too bad, because that's what he really needs. Well, that's what every man really needs. Without suffering, you don't grow. Forget it. It'll never happen. If only there was something I could do for him. If only I could pick Taylor's next woman, you know, someone who will dump him first. Someone who'll give him the gift of heartache. Someone with pms. No. Someone who's looking for more in a man than good looks. And a great sense of humor. And a 6-figure income. And glamorous job. Yeah, but more than that. Someone who'll torture him, turn him inside out, hurt him, you know, like love. Forget it. She's not out there. I bet I could find her. I bet you couldn't. I bet he could. I got 10 bucks says no way. You're on. You in, ned? You are both missing my point. Taylor would have to cooperate. Oh, no. He'll want in on this. It's got to be bigger. Bigger? 2 women. 10 women. 11 women. That's not going to cut it anymore. You're going to have to-- I know. Stop seeing you. Taylor. Lizbette, I'm not good enough for you. You've made some very valid points. I ought to be able to make a commitment by now. Taylor, let's say I never came here today. No. No. Let's just forget everything. No. Listen to me. Your instincts are sound. It's time to move on. Lizbette, I just don't think it can be together. Well, what am I supposed to do? You? Soar. Race announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, the horses are parading to the post for the next race of the afternoon. What? We've got a proposition for you. You have 3 months to get engaged to 3 woman, and I pick the women. You're insane. Chloe, that's pretty. Now, this is the dumbest one they've ever come up with. They're always trying to rope me in on some stupid bet. Then when I take them up on it, they drop like flies. Watch. What are the stakes? Your fishing cabin against my Mercedes. No. No, see, I already have a car. I want something else. Name it. I love torturing him. The Picasso. The Picasso! It's an original. I can't bet that. Fine. No bet. It's Claire's. Her grandfather left it to her. So? You're on. You're kidding! This is for your own good. Announcer: It's moving marcelle in a charging start, with boo-boo, Rachel's ride, and.... Boys, sorry I missed the game. That's ok. Did you cripple another quarterback? Yeah. 2. Bachelorette number 1. Ice goddess! I got 20 says he can't even get a date. 40 says he can. Guys, a beautiful woman is one of the loneliest creatures on the face of the earth. All I need is an opening, a ticket of admission. Bet. Bet. Ned: No. No, Chloe. Horsey. Horsey. Chloe, do you see that pretty blonde lady right there? I just bet she would love to see this picture you drew. That's pretty, honey. Is it for me? Yes. Aw! Come here. Gee, i'm terribly sorry. Oh, that's ok. She's a doll. How old is she? 3. Let me get her off your hands here. Come on, Chloe. Let's not bother these nice people. Oh, she is no bother. I love kids. Well, she's for rent. She's got your eyes. Don't let her father hear you say that. She's not yours? No. I wish she were. Is there any reason why we can't have dinner Saturday night? I don't even know your name. Erin. Erin Cooper. Taylor. Taylor worth. Dinner will be fine. Great. Andre's, 7:00? Ok. See you, guys. You feel free to make the other two a challenge. Well, so much for the bet. Child: How come you can't get this point? Maybe it's because you don't know how to play. Well, I don't know why you don't like him. Claire, he was fluff. His idol was Geraldo Rivera. Well, Veronica, what did you see in him in the first place? He was the first guy I dated in ages who didn't own a VCR, shop Brooks brothers, or drive a BMW. You just described ned. What's different? You and ned became yuppies? Please don't tell ned that. When I first met ned, he had hair down to here and he was growing marijuana in the closet. Ned? Yeah, my ned. Whatever happened to Randy? Ha ha! Gone! He got way too serious too fast. I tell you, the harder they push, the bigger the flaws. You and ned were lucky to get married so early. I know I was lucky. Although sometimes I wish I could just... What? Sometimes I wish I could just... There I said it! Well, who doesn't? Who are these men? Who are these men? Who are these men? Veronica? You're out of your mind. Number 2 is a friend of Claire's. She's a musician. You can't be serious. This is exactly the type of place she can't stand. These are exactly the kind of people she hates. Hi. And you're one of them. No. You can count me out. This bet's totally absurd. You should have thought of that yesterday. Afraid you'll lose? Ned, have you considered how this is going to affect other people's lives? My life, for example. It won't change that much. You can come visit us at the cabin anytime. $50 Nassau. 10 for birdies. The sandies are greenies. I feel lucky today. So? Sign. Forget it. Oh, so you're chickening out? Don't push me. You're reneging on our agreement. Am I to understand that your handshake means nothing? It's time to teach this guy a lesson. Don't you want to know who Eleanor is? Come on, aren't you just a little bit curious about number 3? I am trying to play golf here. She's right over there. Eleanor larimore. You're going to love her. She's classy. She's beautiful. She's an alien, right? No. She's a human. All 3 women are humans. I have a heart. She's married. You're not playing fair today, ned. It's a bad marriage. It's a bad marriage. Trust me. No. No, I don't. I never have. That doesn't matter. I always win anyway. You did read the fine print, didn't you? Because I have to admit, you're being a great sport about this. How will I know that they accept your proposals? Videotapes. Weatherman: We have all this rain up in here. Then we have this low-pressure-- We have all this rain up in here. Then we have this low-pressure front sweeping down-- We have all this rain up in here. Then we have this low-pressure front sweeping down-- sweeping down from the north. Sweeping down from-- I'm a perfectionist. Hey, I don't try to be this way, and it's really rough on the women I know. It's like there's this critic on my shoulder. Trouble-shooter, really. Example-- say she's a cat lover. All I hear is him screaming, "say goodbye to Navy blue." Hey, don't get me wrong. I don't want to grow old alone. I love kids. I certainly love women, but I'm no Casanova. I'm just trying to find a woman to get past the critic in me. My housekeeper-- great cook. Who knows? Maybe one of ned's choices might be the perfect woman. Wouldn't it be great if it was the blonde? Good evening, sir. Thanks. Ok. Here we are. Saturday evening, 7:00. I've given Erin a lot of thought... But mostly about strategy. I can't touch her because if I touch her, I'll jump her, and if I jump her, I'll lose her. Every man wants to jump her, so I've got to be different. Erin. Taylor. This bet's going to kill me. Let's get you back in your coat. We're going on a picnic. They flooded the zone. Kosar threw underneath the coverage to newsome. Sciarra totally wimped out! Sciarra's my main man! Sciarra tackles like he's putting his grandma to bed. Oh, no! Look, you may be the eagles' receptionist-- yay, team! But that does not mean you know a good tackle when you see one. I not only know one, I can do one. Right! Right. Ok. Come at me. Come at me. No. I believe you. No, you don't. Let me have it. Come on. Come on, come at me. Erin, really, I don't want to hurt you. Aah! Aah! Ugh! I think I'm in love. See? You call the plays. Good-bye, Bryan. See you next week. Ned: See you tomorrow, Lewis. How are you today, young fella? Pow! How's the bad seed? We're making progress. I still think you oughta send him through a metal detector before you see him. Mmm. Honey, can I ask you a question? Of course. Why are you fixing Veronica up with Taylor? Who are you mad at? I'm not mad at anyone. Honey, Veronica is a talented, highly respected concert pianist. She's going to hate him. He's going to hate her. She's not nearly vapid enough. No, Claire. As his best friend and as an expert on the human mind, I think it's in his best interests to have an atypical congregation with a member of the opposite sex. You are pissed at him. Yeah. Anchorwoman: The Philadelphia SWAT team was still surrounding a downtown jewelry store. 4 gunmen had taken hostages. As far as we know, no one has been harmed, and negotiations are in progress. The police said... Where's Taylor worth? Over there. Has been for the past 2 years. Novelist Ann Travers died today in a freak skiing accident in Chile. She had broken her leg on the slopes and was being transported to safety when the rescuers lost control of her stretcher. Miss Travers plummeted 1,500 feet to her death. She's best remembered for her 1979 novel aren't I the lucky one? And now, Taylor worth with the weekend weather. Ann Travers... A woman whose luck ran out. Let's see... How'd I do yesterday? Did rain last night. Ha. Got that right. It's still unseasonably cold here on the east coast, but I've been saying that for days. Uh-oh! Hurricane Brenda. Yeah, right down there in Florida. Came ashore--woosh! You want to talk rain! They had to cancel the eagles-dolphins game. And I said it was going to stay out there in the ocean somewhere, so the joke's on me. Here in your tri-state area, we have clear air quality tomorrow in the Delaware valley. Well, Cory, what have you got on for the weekend? I'm going to the country, Taylor. There you have it. Cory chu, outstanding in her field. That's the news. For Bob mayon and Taylor worth, I'm Cory chu. Good night. And we're clear. Everybody have a nice weekend. You have a good weekend, Jerry. Good night, cookie. Great show, Taylor! Thanks, Paul. Have a good weekend, Irv. Are you at least a meteorologist? This must be... Veronica? You just say the weather? It's harder than you think. It would have to be. Look, Taylor. I'm going to save us both some time, and for you, a few bucks. I'd like to give you a little test of mine to see if we're psychologically compatible. Shoot. Imagine this. You walk into a room. You see a hole in the floor. You walk up to it and look in. What do you see? A meteorologist. Reliable birth-control devices? Perfect. Thank you very much. Good luck and goodbye. Imagine this. You walk into a studio. You meet a guy. You talk to him for a couple seconds. What do you see? A man who reads the weather wearing a lot of makeup. Yeah. Doesn't that pique your curiosity at all? I mean, aren't you saying to yourself, "I wonder if he wears more makeup in the evenings"? Let me take you to dinner, you can find out for yourself. I'll call you. I've got your number. 742 minus 619... 123. 487 minus 356... 131. 663 minus 421. 142. Maybe on Mars. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! A woman with all this should look happier than that. Ha ha ha ha! It really doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter what shoe you choose. Any shoe would look good at the end of your leg. Maybe I can help you make a decision. Walk over there. Let me take a look. I really can't tell anything unless you stand up. Nice. How about something like... This? No. Please. Allow me. No... How does that feel? Fine. Please. Come with me. How about... This? Try it on... For me. Hmm. Eleanor: I can't come out. It may take a while, but Eleanor's going to blossom. Whoa! Whoa! Recording: This is Taylor worth. Talk to me. Woman: Hi, Taylor. It's leanne. Hope you're having a good time with your foster child. Give me a call when Kim su goes back to Korea. You big softy. Kim su. She sounded hot! Oh, she is. What am I supposed to do about it? Between being the perfect gentleman every night with Erin d the perfect stud every day with Eleanor, who has the time? In or out? Look, I'll be worried when I see 3 tapes with 3 proposals and 3 yeses. By then, it'll be too late. You'll have lost Claire's Picasso. Your marriage will be destroyed. Ned, look. I'm your best friend. You just say the word, we can call off this whole stupid bet. Raise ya 5. 3 yeses, Taylor, and you only got 2 months left. Veronica will call. So? I see you 5. I raise you 5. Ned: Oh, shit, it's Claire! I... will... See you. Recording: This is Taylor Worth. Talk to me. Taylor, this is Veronica briskow. Ned and Claire are coming to dinner tomorrow night. Why don't you join us? My number is 555-3299. Bye. Ned: Shit! Oh, and, ned? Go home. Double shit! No, no, no, no, no. It's legato. Legato! Don't you understand? Legato. Here. Listen to it again. I've already listened to it 3 times. Hmm? No. I don't know what legato is. Sounds like a boat race. Boat race. Ha ha ha. Taylor hates music. Well, why don't you tell us what legato means? Nice sweater, Taylor. It's very Brooks brothers. Oh. Are you still having trouble with your BMW? I can name that segue in 5 words. Name that segue. Sweater. Cold. Alps. Germany. BMW. BMW. So... what did your manager say about the rehab center benefit? He hates it when I play for free, but I'll do it. Oh, great. Thank you! I mean, if I can't play for 15 minutes to keep a bunch of drugged-out teenagers from stealing my car, what kind of citizen am I? Yeah. A real philanthropist. No. I leave that to Claire. Mmm. My tombstone's going to read, "what's in it for me?" Nothing, if you marry Taylor. Let's eat! Taylor, you come join me in the kitchen. Claire, check ned's pockets for hallucinogens. If you can't speak English with the rest of us, I'm going to have to send you home. Mm-hmm. Come on. I want to see Taylor's reaction when he sees the painting. You mean, you didn't tell him about the painting? No. Ha ha ha. Let's go. Why do you ask? Just curious. I can't stand that term "new age." I was doing it long before it was ever called that. I had a classical background-- oberlin, Juilliard, the whole competition circuit, but it was basically too rigid for me. I mean, I really hate that kind of stuff. Remember the critic that sits on my shoulder? Well, he just passed out. I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do? This must be another one of her psychological tests. I tell you, if I hadn't signed that damn contract, I wouldn't put up with this crap for a minute. I thought the hole in the floor was hard. So the rest is history. I'm having a little trouble concentrating on what you're saying. So could you just shut up? Taylor! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Thank you so much. Oh, I'm glad you came. How about a game of monopoly? Ned, I'm a little beat. Ned, turn around and walk out. Come on, Taylor. Let's let the girl get to bed. Now! Bye, ned. Bye. Oh, you know what-- Come on, Taylor. Let the girl get to bed. Um! How about this? Does that feel good? It's fine. You're crushing my bone. Sorry. That's ok. Aah! Oh! I've had better times taking out splinters. I wish it was yesterday. Hey, it happens. There wouldn't be great sex if we didn't have awful sex. Awful... Mechanical... Slightly painful... Unsatisfying sex. I'm going to hop in the shower! Could you let yourself out, please? Sure. I love my lingerie. Uh, Eleanor... What do you say, next time we just talk? Why? I don't know. Romance? I get to know you, you get to know me. I think we're getting to know each other just fine. Ahem. Oh! Would you give me a special signal on the show tonight? When you rub your nose, it means you wish... Thank god it was just my nose. Dinner at Erin's will be a welcome change. You know, I thought I'd find you here. I'm only going to say this once. Erin is a flower, a rare and beautiful flower. And I don't know what she sees in a guy like you. But if you mess with her or lay a hand on her, I'll rip your head off. Seems reasonable. Terry! So glad you dropped by. Can you stay for coffee? Put Taylor down. He doesn't know you're kidding. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, I get it now! Uhh! I'll be in the living room. Did you like him? Isn't he great? Yeah. He seems very nice. Oh, he is. He's smart and sophisticated and really considerate. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. He won't even start the car unless we put on our seat belts! What a guy. I've never gone out with someone for a month who didn't make a pass. I never made a pass. You're my friend, silly.

Ambivalence I can work with. Hate takes longer. What are you doing here? Shh! Guess who's the head fund raiser for the rehab center. Hmm. Come here. Come here. See ya. Hi. God, Eleanor, please. Not here. Oh, yes, here. In the lobby. In the middle of the street. In the cereal aisle at the a&p. Tell me you're dying for it. Tell me i'm dying for it. Tell me I'm the best. You're the best.

I don't know if I mentioned it, but i'm a psychiatrist. Sometimes I can tell a great marriage when I see one. It seems to me that you guys have a really strong, close, good one, am I right? Taylor! Taylor! Where are you running to? Taylor? Taylor Worth? The weatherman? That's right. I love your reports! You give the most thoroughly detailed weather reports! I know. Weather's a hobby of mine. Oh. How about that storm last march? Aiyee! Was that a shock or what? Your fly is open. Quite a shock. And that flash flood in Nebraska last may? Whoosh! How can she stand him? Your fly is open. Oh, honey! Honey, look. Taylor Worth. Oh. How do you do? Your fly is open! Well, it doesn't make me deaf! Uh, excuse me. Got to run. 11:00 news. You played beautifully. Thank you. Do you know what time it is? I know you just played for 2 hours, but may I come in? Just so you know why I'm mad, I hate it when my friends run out of my concerts without telling me how wonderful I am, and I really hate it when guys come by here unannounced thinking it means that I have to let them in. How many you let in there so far? Imagine what she's going to do to me when I call off our wedding. Look, you got to admit you sent me some pretty mixed signals. I mean, "here's your watch ecause I never want to see you again, "but here's a ticket because I want you to see what you're missing." Well, I saw, ok? And you're magnificent. I can't wait to hear you again. Call me. Hello? Veronica Briskow? Yes. Hi. It's Taylor Worth. I know this seems silly, but I can't help it. It's such a pretty movie. Enjoy the show! I haven't seen it since I was a little girl. Really? I've never seen it. You haven't? No. 2 please. Wait till you see dopey. He's the most adorable thing. Hey, that's why I'm here. Thanks. Actually, I had a different sort of day planned, one that ends in a proposal. Hello. Maybe if I toss in a honeymoon at Disneyland. Come on! It's so very beautiful. They're so much in love. What are you doing? Filming our own happy ending. Can you move a little to the left? Whoa! Whoa. Right there. That's perfect. Erin. Taylor. Erin, I think you already know what I'm going to ask you. And this may seem inappropriate because I haven't known you very long, but, Erin... Taylor. Dear Erin... Will you marry me? Oh. Ohh! I take it that's a yes? Can I hear the word, please? Can I hear that precious word? Oh, yes. Oh, yes, Taylor. I will marry you. Take me, Taylor. Oh, wild horses couldn't stop me. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Ow! What? Oh. Sorry. Ned. Ned. Not only am I 1/3 of the way to teaching you a lesson, but tonight, I will be lying with the gods. Erin, I want you to know, there is no one I would rather be with and nothing I would rather be doing. Mmm! Mmm! Oh! I'm so glad I waited. Oh, yeah. I'm glad we waited, too. No. I'm so glad I waited. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm glad that we waited, too. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! No, Taylor. I'm so glad I waited. What? Erin, I know this is our first time, darling, but you're not saying, are you... That this is your first time? Yes. Ohh. Mmm. Taylor, don't be upset. I know it's not your first time. It's different for men. Oh, Erin, Erin, Erin. You are very special. You are. You are. And--and--and you've waited such a long time. I want this to be right for you. Let's wait. Ok? Let's wait till after the wedding. Are you sure? Right now, more than anything, I want you inside me, to finally know what it feels like. Oh, god. I'm sure. You are so good at looking at the big picture. Oh, yeah. I'm looking at the big picture. Mmm! What? I'm not a monster. Can I hear the word, please? Can I hear that precious word? Oh! Oh! Oh, yes, Taylor. I will marry you. Take me, Taylor. Oh, yeah. Wild horses couldn't stop me. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Ow! What? Oh, sorry. Ned, ned. Not only am I 1/3 of the way to teaching you a lesson and winning this bet, but tonight, I will be lying with the gods. [TV static] I'll buy. It's my idea. Forget it. I've been trying to take you out for a month. 2, please. Thanks. Guess it's the hot ticket in town. Hey! Shh! Quiet! Shh! Shh! Mmm! This is better than primal therapy. It's more cathartic. Care for a drink? We have Mai Tai or Tequila sunrise. ♪ La da da da ♪ whoa, whoa, ho! No, no. What did you really think of the movie? I thought it was great. I'd love to lie there till the right woman came along. You don't get it, do you? She leaves everything behind-- her home, her little friends, and for what? For some handsome prince! The whole ending implies that a woman needs a man to bring her to life! Veronica, it is not real life! It's a fairy tale! Come on! I mean, did you ever read the frog prince? In that one, he stayed a frog until she kissed him and brought him back to life. Yeah, well, I've kissed a lot of frogs, and I haven't met a prince yet. U've been kissing the wrong frogs. It's hard to find the right person. It's a search, a process. I don't think it's supposed to be easy. Well, maybe I misjudged you, Taylor. Up until now, I thought of you as just a pleasant diversion, but maybe there's a well of compassion and sensitivity in you. Really? Not a deep well. More like a bucket or a toy pail. You can stop before you get to Dixie cup. You know, some say you have to kiss a frog twice. Oh, why did you ever come into my life? To make you happy. To hold you in my arms forever. I'll never be able to look my father in the face. Look, let's get away-- let's get married immediately, right away, tonight. You mean elope? That's what I mean. But where would we go? Guess what? This Veronica? She's real easy to be with, once she stops busting your balls. ♪ Da da da da ♪ after she agrees to marry me, I'm going to keep dating her. ...can't talk to one another.

Announcer: I, myself, have played here. Ah. I admire those women. That's because their job is more difficult than yours. What in the world is going on down there? Looks like the eagles cheerleaders are unrolling a banner or something. "Congratulations Erin and tay--" Mmm! Hello, miss Briskow? This is Eleanor larimore confirming the luncheon tomorrow. Please give me a call. Thank you. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Bye, love buckets. Piece of cake. Veronica. Hmm? How about if tonight I give you a special signal on the show, you know, one that says I'm thinking about you? Oh, that's sweet, but I watch channel 8. That doesn't bother me. Here in the tri-state area, we have high winds coming down from New York, but we'll have clear air quality tomorrow in all the Delaware valley. That's all for the weather. Now back to my favorite newscaster, Cory chu, right after this commercial break. And in local news, Philadelphia city council... Hello? Hey, buddy. Did you see the game? Ned, I don't have time to talk now. Things are getting a little close. I am 15 minutes late for a date with somebody, and I don't even know who. W that banner on TV. Who knows who else did. Hey, you know, Veronica and Eleanor are having lunch together. I think this whole thing is gonna blow up in your face. Ned, one more thing. Yeah, what? This is getting ridiculous. I've got to break up with Erin. Have you picked the ushers yet? Ushers? No. I haven't. Uh, see, Erin. We have to talk. At Teddy's tux, if you have 6 or more ushers, the groom gets his tux for free. I have a tux. See, I didn't know that. Erin, you're a wonderful girl, and I care about you very much. From a selfish point of view, I can't think of anything I would rather have than you being my wife for the next 50 or 60-- what are these? Swatches. Swatches? For what? For my dress and the bridesmaids dresses. What do you mean by a selfish point of view? I can't marry you. What? Look, I don't know what I was thinking-- I guess that we'd get married and that we'd be together and we'd decide to try to have a family. And then we'd try for a year or 2... And then we'd both be tested and you would realize that i'm-- you're saying you're sterile. Yes. Oh, I knew you'd understand. Erin, you deserve better than me. Wait a minute. You're saying that we'll never have to worry about birth control and if we want a baby, all I'll have to do is be artificially inseminated. I am sorry they won't be yours, though. It's not just that I'm sterile. See, I can't have... An orgasm. You mean you can just stay hard forever? No, goddamn it! I mean I'm impotent! Oh. I understand. You shouldn't be doomed to a life without sex. Now, don't rush me. It's just a lot to think about. Could you give me a couple of days? Oh, of course. Now, in the meantime, which of these do you like best for my maid of honor? 2, please. Thanks. I had to bring her. Hey. Do you know about our discount passbooks? Come here! You want it, huh? Come on. You be my little girl? Oh! Yes. Ooh! I'll be your little girl. Will you be my mommy? Oh, yes! Oh, oh, I'll be your mommy. Ahhh! Will you be my bride? Oh! Yes! No, no. Yes! Yes, I'll be your bride! Yes! Hi, honey. Hi, sweetie. Oh... oh, you know your Picasso? Mm-hmm.

Figure skating! That's close. Pair figure skating. Very good! And that's all. Oh, no, no. Do one more, please. Please, please. Ok. Ok. But this is not a sport. This is an entirely different event altogether. AAA aaaa! Aah! Do it! Yes! Ha ha ha! Oh, I'm so happy. Ha ha ha! What is it? Oh, thank you. I haven't a clue. Miss mouse America. Ha ha ha! Get out of here. I feel great. After today, I will be through with this bet. I'll have the cabin, I'll have the Picasso, but best of all, I will have the girl. I'm going to have to write ned a thank-you note. I'm not going to call off the engagement with Veronica. I'm not going to rush it either. A couple years down the line when a little Taylor sounds like a good idea, we'll tie the knot. I really love this girl. Ha ha ha! Stop that. Ah. Let's sit here. Yeah. Ah. Why do I have a feeling it's time for a serious talk? You know me pretty well. See, it's just that, um... Aah. Taylor, you're nervous. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. You're my favorite person. Oh, boy. Oh, god. Oh. You know, all my life I was convinced I was responsible for my own happiness. I could never depend on anyone else to give it to me. But I was wrong. You've given it to me. Come on. Sit down. Veronica, marry me. Marry you? Ha ha ha! I can't marry you. I thought you wanted to move in together. I do! And have kids and grow old. Yeah, well, I'd want to try it out first. Live together for a few months, see how we get along. How we get along? How we get along? You do the mouse Olympics with everyone? I think there's more to marriage than mouse Olympics. Yeah, so do I. There's a lot more. There's caring. Veronica, I care about you very much. You make me laugh at myself. You know what you have? You have my heart. And you know what? I don't want you to let go. I want to have terrible fights with you and know that you're not going anywhere. Know that I'm not going anywhere. I want to pick things out with you and buy them! I want a... You know what, I want a... Aah! I want a commitment! Aah! Make one with me. Oh, my god. I've been swept off my feet. Is that a yes? Yes. Yes! I want to marry you now... Today. Well, how about sometime this month? I got to tell her about the bet. Pretty ironic, huh? Same thing that got me into this could take it all away. Poetic justice doesn't feel so good. That was nice. We're here. Veronica, I've done some things in my past I'm not proud of. I don't want to hear about them. Yeah, but, see, there's this one thing in my very recent past, something I realize in retrospect wasn't very nice. Something that involved a few innocent people. Something that now that my... Um... Single days are behind me, I realize was not very nice. Are you planning on doing it again? No. Are you a criminal? God, no! Then don't tell me. There you have it. However... You better marry me soon, like before I see your face on the post office wall. How about Saturday? I have to be at Claire's in 3 hours. I'm meeting that Eleanor lady. I think I can squeeze in a blood test. Do me a favor. What? Let's wait. Tell ned and Claire together. You're right. They'd probably never believe just one of us. Good weekend, huh? Mmm... Are we talking girl in love here? Yes, but I'm not supposed to say anything about it. I promised him I wouldn't. Are you moving in with him? I can't tell you. Are you getting married? I'm not supposed to tell you. Oh, my god! Is he a great lay? Oh... As a matter of fact, he is. Well, sold. Good. I had a chance to marry a great lay once, but I didn't. I married Howard sr., the richest, sweetest, most appropriate person I could find. And for 12 years... I managed to go through life as if the rest... Didn't matter to me. And then I met this man. How he ever found me, I have no idea, but he knew exactly what I needed, and he gave it to me. And he still gives it to me and gives it to me and gives it to me. I can't think of anything else. Who knew? Ha ha ha! Enough about me. What's your fellow like? Oh... well. Excuse me. Give me it! It's my tape! It's mine! What is going on here? She put a tape on, and you said we should never do that. I want to see Mary poppins. You do? That's not Mary poppins, and you're going to get a time-out. You're going to get a time-out, too. Are not. Are, too. Are not. Quiet, kids! Go to your room. Go to your room. Erin: Taylor. I knew we'd be sent to our room. Will you marry me? Yeeea! Is that a yes? Can I hear that precious word? Oh, oh, yes, Taylor. I will marry you. That's my Taylor. That's my Taylor. Take me, Taylor. That's her Taylor. Ned, ned, not only am I 1/3 of the way to teaching you a lesson and winning this bet, but tonight I will be lying with the gods! Ned. What? Wedding? Wedding. St. James chapel, 2:00 Saturday. Cigar. Cigar? Rocket, you're not getting the painting. No tape, no painting. Ned, I cannot believe how immature you are being. Do you expect me to show you a tape of the woman I love accepting my proposal? If you want the painting. Painting? Painting! It's not about a painting. It's about human beings. It's not about a stupid bet. People! I'm ashamed of that bet. It's contemptible! Really. Playing with people's lives that way. You should all be ashamed, especially you, ned. Well, I never thought you'd win. Win? That's not the point. The point is, I am out. Out! You're serious? Yes. You're really going to marry her? Yes, I am. Forget the bet. Good man. I still get my $400 though, right? All bets are off. What about Erin and Eleanor? I'll handle it. Hey, Taylor. How are you? Hey, Ira. Tracey. Thanks. See you tomorrow. It's Wednesday, and everything is working out just great. Tomorrow, I'm going to have one last lunch with Erin. She'll call off the wedding by dessert, trust me. By Friday, Eleanor should get this letter. I told her it was time to put her passion back into her marriage. Marriage. I'm getting married to Veronica on Saturday. Did you ever think it was going to work out this well? Ha! Hi, Taylor. Hi. Amy! Do the station a favor, and call this Eleanor back! Thursday, 9:00 a.m. "I want to see you." 9:15, "where are you?" 9:30, "I need you." Et cetera, et cetera. Here's a smart girl. "Can't make lunch today, how about Friday? Erin." Man: It will be nice to see you, too. Thank you very much. Hi. Worth. 1:00. For two. Yes. The young lady is inside. Ahh. Sir, she-- Hello. Taylor. You can't make it? I know we've got a lot to talk about. You said you'd make your decision by now. No, I can't wait till next week. It's got to be tomorrow in the morning. Uh, fine, fine. Your house, 11:00. Yeah, yeah, thank you. Bye. Hi, Taylor. Where are you? Why haven't you called me? You've been very naughty. Mommy's going to have to punish you. Hi. Hello, Taylor. I've made my decision. Whatever it is, I'll understand. Come on in. I may have time for a haircut before the wedding. Surprise! Surprise! Mom and dad, this is Taylor. Son. Mom: Oh, Taylor. Erin, can I talk to you for a minute? Not right now. Where is that party mix? Welcome to the family, son. Hey, hi! I'm chip, brother of the bride. Oh, don't worry about that. You'll have plenty of time for talking after you're married... Like on your wedding night. Ha ha ha! God, I love Erin. She's my favorite niece. You know, it's just like her to find somebody like you to marry. I mean, what a heart on that girl. Always bringing home some limping puppy or bird with a broken wing. Erin, Erin, can I talk to you? Have you tried the stamp test? The what? The stamp test. You take a few stamps from a roll, enough to circle your penis. I'd say in your case... About 5. Put them on before you go to bed. Overlap them just enough so you can lick one to make them stick. Now, if they break off during the night, your problem is up here. You want to know why? Why? Erin! You don't have to yell, honey. I'm right here. Erin, how could you tell everyone? Huh? This was supposed to be personal. Honey, I just talked about it with my family and some of the guys on the team. Some of the guys on the team! And the coach. The coach! Damn it, Erin! They all seem to agree that after the first year of marriage, sex isn't that important. Sex is the cornerstone of intimacy. Intimacy, schmintimacy. I got a hunch about you, Taylor. I think your problem's just with women. I know you would look good in Rose, but Lillian would look awful, you know. We're not getting married. Erin, I can't marry you. You can, and you will. I want to propose a toast. A toast! Hey! Right! No, stay there, son. Today... Is the happiest day of my life. My little girl's engaged. She's got herself a wonderful guy. Of course, I'd be a little happier if he could function as a real man, but even so, it's the happiest day of my life. Hip hip! Hooray! ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good-- ♪ Oh! Hi, honey. You're home. Yeah. I'm home. Where are you? I'm home, too. I know what's bothering you. No. No, you don't. Sex. No. You're afraid it's going to be routine now that we're living together. It won't be. I promise. Look! Oh! Jesus! Let's party. Aah! It's been a really bad day. You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Go ahead. Say it. Who are you talking to? Aah! Can you wash my back? Hey! Hey, taxi! Taylor! Need a ride to the wedding? Yes! I'm just going to drop these kids off, ok? Mommy, Jason hit me! Tell Jason you don't like it. Jason, I don't like it! I don't like it! Good. Claire, can you drop me off first? Hi, Taylor! Hi, Taylor! We're off! Claire, did you hear me? Hey, pirate. Could you move your ice cream a little? Marvin dropped his ice cream on Taylor. Mommy, I lost my balloon. Can we stop? No! Sure we can, sweetie. The wedding was supposed to start 5 minutes ago. Taylor, they're not going to start without you! Left. Left! Claire, left! Turn left! Whoa! Relax! There's nothing to worry about! Oh, I'm getting carsick. Now, that's something to worry about. Jason's throwing up on me. Tell Jason you don't like it. None of us likes it. I have to get to the wedding! Stop the car! You're so on edge! Take a valium! What's a valium? It's like a nap. Oh. Bye, Taylor! Bye, Taylor! Bye, Taylor! Oh, there he is. Ladies and gentlemen, the groom. Where have you been? It's 31 flavors. You look disgusting! Here. Come on. Let's get a shot here. That's nice. That's good. Come on. Get up there. Go! Go! God... I can't believe it. I'm walking down the aisle. Hi. Seeing you right now made me realize something. Deep down inside, I didn't think you'd be here. Thank you for being here. Let's get married. Shall we begin now? Yes. Every couple has its own story. It's been my observation that the more interesting the story, the better the marriage, and it looks to me like Taylor and Veronica are going to have a wonderful marriage. All of us are gathered here today to witness and support that union. Taylor worth, do you take Veronica briskow to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, to love and to Cherish from this day forward, till death do you part? I do. Veronica briskow, do you take Taylor worth to be your lawfully wedded husband, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, to love and to Cherish from this day forward, till death do you part? I'd never marry him. And you can bet on it! Taylor... Did she say she was going to marry you? And you believed it. This was a setup. I don't know. I don't know anything about this. Ned. Oh, god. Claire... Claire! Claire? Claire? Veronica... marry me. I can't marry you. I thought you wanted to move in together. I do! And have kids and grow old. Ha ha ha! I'd want to try it out first, live together for a few months, see how we get along. How we get along? How we get along? Go away. You do the mouse Olympics with everyone? There's more to marriage than mouse Olympics. Yeah, so do I. There's a lot more. I said, go away! There's caring. Veronica, I care about you very much. Aw, the hell with it. You know what you have? You have my heart. You know what? I don't want you to let go. I want to have terrible fights with you-- yeah? Ned: It's me. Go away. Are you going to lock yourself in there another month? I am not home, ned. I've seen her. Know that I'm not going anywhere. I want to pick things out with you and buy them. What'd she say? She mention me? Did she talk about it? Huh? Actually, I just watched her get into Claire's car. I want a... You know, I want a... Aah! I want a commitment! Aah! Make one with me. Oh, my god. I've been swept off my feet. Is that a yes? Yes. Yes-- Give me that tape. No. Give me the tape! I insist you get professional help. These are classic signs of depression. Furthermore... No! Give me the tape! No! No! Yes, ned! Stop! Uh! Aaaoooh! Oh! What? What? No! Let me go! That's my bad ankle. Ohh! Ohh! Uh! Ohh! Ohh! Don't be an asshole. There's a real Veronica out there. Who hates me. You don't know that. Ned... I proposed to her to win a bet. Yeah. That's pretty fucked. It was your idea! Well, yeah... I'm sorry. I just thought it would be a good idea for you to suffer. Yeah? Well, here it is. Take a good look. Hope you're happy. You hate me, don't you? You hate me. No. But you have every right to. But I assume, since I'm not out there on the street with that tape, that you've forgiven me. Am I right? Well? Maybe Veronica could do the same with you. I think it's different between a man and a woman. Not as different as you think. Maybe that's been part of your problem. Did Claire forgive you? Yes... But I had to ask. Well... Beg, actually. Beg. Thanks. Well, our next item comes from our great football team, the eagles. Of course, they're great now. For those of you who grew up here as I did, you remember what they used to be like. They were in last place so many years, we used to read the sports page upside-down just to feel what it'd be like to see our team in first place. Well, we have here a great item. It's a Jersey worn by our very own Terry Childs here. Yay! Now, who's going to start the bidding on this Jersey? $200. Come on! The man sacked elway twice wearing this very Jersey! Let's go! $300. Sold for $300! Well, our next item for auction has to be the special one of the evening, and I expect the biggest response to this one. We all enjoyed miss briskow's playing earlier this evening. Well, she has graciously donated to the highest bidder an evening performance at a private party. How's that? Miss briskow, would you come up? Come on up. Takes a lot of guts. I'd never do my act in a house. See me at the kitchen-- "please don't eat that. I have a chicken joke. It's great. Put down your sandwich." Ok., now. Let's open up the bidding at $200. $200. $400. 600. 6. Do I hear 7? $1,000. Woo! $1,000. Going once, going twice... $2,000. I heard $2,000. 2,200. 3,000. 3,200. 3,200. Going once... Going twice. $4,000 and a fishing cabin. A fishing cabin? Taylor? Look! It's our very own channel 5 weatherman-- Taylor worth! Look! Ok! Uh... Do I hear 4,200? 4,200. 4,200. Ok. Going once... Oh... Going twice... Not so fast, David. $4,200, a fishing cabin, and a public proclamation of what a creep he is. Ooh! I'm a creep. I'm a bastard. He's a great lay. I knew it! I don't deserve you, I know that, but I can't imagine not loving you. You're bold, you're splendid, you're intriguing. You're a whole lot of things I never knew mattered. Oh! Oh! Veronica... Veronica... Save me. I beg you. Marry me. Is that all? And a scrabble rematch. Unlimited mouse Olympics? I'll even become a meteorologist. Then kiss me! Ohh! Ohh! Sold for $4,200, a fishing cabin, a public proclamation of what a creep he is, a scrabble rematch, unlimited mouse Olympics, he'll become a meteorologist, and a kiss.
