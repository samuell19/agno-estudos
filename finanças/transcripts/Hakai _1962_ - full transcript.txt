"This is a story of the past. "The past holds many points on which subsequent ages should reflect, "and as someone once said, this is because events of the past are assured to be true." - Preface to Hakai Hakai Transgression Screenplay by Natto Wada Based on the novel by Toson Shimazaki Starring: Raizo Ichikawa, Hiroyuki Nagato, Eiji Funakoshi, Shiho Fujimura, Rentaro Mikuni Kanjiro Nakamura, Kyoko Kishida, Seiji Miyaguchi, Yoshi Kato, Haruko Sugimura Directed by Kon Ichikawa Hey, come here. I have salt. You can have as much as you want. Come here. It's nothing for you to worry about. People have long since stopped visiting this place. It's probably just someone on his way to Kazawa hot springs. He's my older brother. I'm quite sure it's him. We'll bury him on the mountain at first light. We have a custom of not keeping a grave at the temple. I am in great debt to you. I found Mr. Segawa's body around three days after he died. That's what the constable said after we called him up the mountain to investigate. We all live in huts in mountain valleys far from each other. Sometimes we don't see one another for days at a time. I knew that Mr. Segawa had a mean-tempered ox. But he was an experienced farmer. Nobody could've seen this coming. Excuse me. I just wanted to stop by for a moment. I believe that a cattle breeder named Segawa lives in this area. Ushimatsu, what are you doing here? I'd like to ask you the same question, Uncle. That's my father's home, isn't it? Something happened, didn't it? I beg you, please leave this mountain immediately! Is my father ill? Is he injured? Ushimatsu, he's dead. He was gored by a bull. It happened maybe three days ago. Dead? Last winter, I had appendicitis. I thought I was a goner. He came down the mountain in the middle of the night to look after me. That was the last time I saw him. I knew it... - I knew he was dead. - How? I only told you just now. Did someone else tell you? My father. Three days ago, just at the time that it was my turn as night watch at the school, I went out to walk the school grounds after nightfall... Ushimatsu! Ushimatsu! I realized immediately that something had happened to him. If only I hadn't hesitated in coming here. I had no trouble whatsoever finding this place... a place that he forbade me from even coming near to. I'm sure that it was my father's voice calling me that night. I'm sure the voice you heard was my brother's. I have no doubt. I'm not just telling you this out of pity... But he wasn't calling you to come here. He was saying, "Ushimastsu, don't forget!," "Ushimatsu, hide the secret!" Right until his final breaths. He refused to see me for 10 years, and I couldn't see him when he died, either. Such is the lot of the burakumin. - Why was I born a burakumin? - Stop that talk! When you finished elementary school, your father was determined you continue on to secondary school. He knew that he would never be able to see you again. My brother, you, and my wife and I... lived in this burakumin village in Komoro for many years, before we moved to the outskirts of Nezu Village to conceal our past. Your father was the elder of the burakumin village, so he knew that secrecy was out of the question. He left you to live with me and my wife, and lived on this ranch. He wasn't able to work in society like a regular person. Preventing you from suffering the same fate... was the only reason that he lived like a hermit. If you thoughtlessly reveal your identity as a burakumin, your father's entire life's work will have been for nothing. Father, I swear that I will never break your commandment to hide my identity. No matter the circumstances, no matter who I meet, I will never reveal this secret. That's enough. Now you must leave this place. If you go along the ridgeline, you'll hit the road to Komoro. You won't get there before daybreak. Catch the train in Komoro. Uncle, please let me see my father, just for a moment. You're protecting the same secret as me. The burakumin code dictates that you don't expose another member who is living outside their community. The burakumin abide by the code... but they're people too. You can't always trust them. Your father understood that. Please. Just for a moment, and then I'll be on my way. It's only candlelight. You might not even recognize him. Make sure nobody sees your face. A friend of the family has come. - He wants to briefly pay his respects. - That's fine. Let him in. The owner of the bull is taking it to market tomorrow. He said he would use the money he got from the meat to pay the funeral costs. That's very kind. He should have just left the bull alone when it got lost. Instead, for some reason he felt he had to go looking for it. Someone saw him looking for the bull, waist deep in waterweeds. I think I heard him walking up and down the mountains calling for the bull. It made me flinch... Maybe he wanted to die. I don't think that Mr. Segawa absolutely wanted to die, but it seemed as if he was shouting to the heavens. Screaming from the bottom of his soul! It was the sadness, the feeling of our burakumin village... The agony of a man who could not die without regret! Blackie! - 52kg, 300. - 52kg, 500. - 44kg. - He's unclean! - Go away! Oh, God! He's unclean! It serves him right! He's unclean! Purify this place with salt! Oh, you're back. I was passing by, and the landlord said you had returned. Thanks for taking care of things while I was away. I'm sure it was an imposition to handle both my class and yours. Forget about it. I assume you're back so soon because your uncle recovered? However, since he must've been gravely ill, I would've stayed on a bit, just to make sure. Ma'am, did I hear there was some kind of disturbance? Yes, it was a real nuisance... I assume that you heard about it, Mr. Segawa. That wealthy man that came here from Shimotakai for medical treatment... Well, it turned out he was of the burakumin caste. He was removed from the hospital and returned here. Of course, we asked him to leave at once. People seem to think we knew, but that we let him stay anyway... because he was a big tipper. What a nuisance! I assure you that we had no idea. We would take no money from the likes of him. That's unfortunate. Please enjoy your meal. He was kicked out of the hospital and then the inn. Then he had his back smeared with salt. Why couldn't he have kept it a secret?! Even if he'd tried, it would be exposed and the same thing would've happened. Aren't burakumin human? I don't see any difference between them and regular people. If you do, let me know, Mr. Tsuchiya. The designation of the burakumin class was something that suited the policymakers. Their descendants were confined to live... in a specific region and have a lower standard of living than others. This is a new age! We are fighting in a war, as children of the emperor! I've been meaning to tell you, but you should probably stop... reading books by Rentaro Inoko. Rentaro Inoko? Yes. You sound like you're reciting one of his diatribes. You're mistaken. The reason Rentaro Inoko risked his life for the burakumin liberation movement... was that he himself was a burakumin. You're a normal person. You don't have to regurgitate his rhetoric. Reading is important, but you must maintain a proper perspective. If it's all right, there's someone I'd like to introduce to you. - Who? - Rentaro Inoko, of course. I believe you'll dislike him. Such public figures seem appealing from a distance, but once you get to know them, you'll find that their distinction from others often masks numerous personal flaws. You've got gall, saying that about a man you've never met. He's a fine man. Have you met him? Well... of course not. I think he has lung disease. If you have death breathing down your neck, I imagine it could inspire you to write great works. But I guarantee you, no man from a burakumin village could ever produce great ideas. Stop, already. It breaks my heart to hear you of all people say such things. You must be exhausted from your trip. It's made you emotional. Chasing a burakumin out of town is normal. Rest up, you'll feel better. I'll see you tomorrow at school. Look! It's human blood! It's Japanese blood! It's not different from anyone else's. We have the same four limbs. The same anatomy, the same blood. Why are we discriminated against? Why must it be a secret? Father, tell me! Help me! Even his grave is hidden... He just slipped away, like a stray cat. Mr. Segawa, glad I ran into you. There's something I want to ask you. I imagine you heard that I resigned my position. Yes, the headmaster mentioned it. The headmaster is a master of cunning! The truth is, I was forced to resign. He didn't like me taking sick leave from work. If I resigned due to health considerations, neither of us would lose face. Fired in perfect health. Newly published, "Record of Repentance" by Rentaro Inoko I worked there nearly 10 years. My salary was a pittance. Six months more and I would have gotten a pension. Mr. Segawa, can't you get them to keep me on for six more months? I'll see what I can do, but the headmaster is a stickler for rules... Thank you. I mean it, thank you. I envy you. You're young, but the students already love you. Even the headmaster sees it. On the other hand... I still have four small children. Damn, I think I'm starting to sober up. Come to think of it, where are you dragging that cart to? The inn I'm staying at frequently accommodates noisy guests, - so I decided to move. - Where to? - Lotus Temple, in Atago City. - Lotus Temple! I'm sure you've no idea why I accompanied you all the way to the temple... and I have no intention of telling you now. Your name, sir? Segawa... Ushimatsu Segawa. Welcome. Mother told me you were coming. Please come inside. I'll get Shota to carry your bags later. Are you the daughter of the abbot? - Yes, my name is Shiho. - Is the mistress away? - She should return presently. - And the abbot? He's in. I see him from time to time at the school, but we've never been properly introduced. He seems very affable. I haven't that many bags, so I'll bring them in myself. Is there anything you need? - I'm going out for a while. - But why? - To the bookstore? - Please, don't go! What book do you need? I'll go buy it for you. Don't worry about it. You don't have to go right now. Then you're not going to leave, right? - Sure, I'll stay. - Thank you. On this day. On this fine day, The Emperor was born On this fine day, His glory shined forth. It became a fine day. - That was great. - I lost to you again, sir. Even though I'm sure you worked into the wee hours on your speech. I'm sure nothing I had to say was that compelling. I found your interpretation of the characters for... loyalty and filial piety to be quite moving. I hope that it wasn't beyond the students' grasp. It was one of the finest oratories I've had the privilege of hearing. I heard that Mr. Takayanagi married an extremely beautiful woman. You must really have your hands full, what with the election coming up. Really? I hadn't heard! Well, we are at war after all. The wedding was a quiet affair. I hope you don't take my silence on the matter as a slight. - Your wife is from Tokyo? - Yes. But I believe the real congratulations should go to the headmaster. The prefecture is honoring him with an award. He's to receive a gold medal. Oh, well! How about that? That is indeed quite something, headmaster! I couldn't have done it without all your help. However, the decision is still unofficial. Please keep it quiet until then. This is quite an honor for Nagano's educational system. - We'll have to have a lavish celebration. - I'm sorry to create a fuss. Come in! - I'm sorry to intrude. - Don't worry! We were just about to leave. It's Mr. Kazama. He asked me to appeal on his behalf. Well, you've gone to quite the trouble for Mr. Kazama. I'll listen. - I have a request... - I know that! Mr. Segawa has spoken of it many times. I was wondering if it would be possible to receive a pension... - following my resignation. - Of course. Look at the primary school ordinances for yourself. You could count the subsequent five months as vacation time, and then he would have worked here for the full 10 years. Mr. Kazama, I don't know what you're thinking, but the time... you haven't come to school up til now would certainly seem to count as vacation. You've taken time off as if there's nothing wrong with it. You've inconvenienced other teachers. The teachers share a strong bond and see no inconvenience. A strong bond! That's an uncomfortable thought, and it's unbecoming of a teacher. Of course, if you report to work every day... for the remaining five months, that's another matter entirely. It's because he can't work that we're here. I am the headmaster. This school, the teachers, and the students are all under my care. I cannot afford to turn a blind eye to anyone trying to undermine discipline here. Forget about your pension and convalesce. I'm afraid I've no choice... but to follow your advice. What?! You chattered on about how you weren't... going to leave today til you talked some sense into the headmaster! Yes! I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused. Forget about us! I was only just recently appointed headmaster of this school. I would hope that you would be more supportive. At any rate, as I'm sure you'll soon hear, I am to receive a medal from the prefecture. I don't credit this to any policies that I have personally implemented. On the contrary, Mr. Tsuchiya, I couldn't have done it without the help of your uncle. He is the county educational supervisor. It has nothing to do with me. It's of no use trying to reason with young people. The county educational supervisor oversees us. An order from them is obeyed unflinchingly. I'm sure you'll understand in time. "Record of Repentance" by Rentaro Inoko Thank you. Shall I wrap it? I am a burakumin... Sir! You are him, aren't you?! Mr. Rentaro Inoko, I mean. Yes... I'm Inoko. I've seen your photo in books and newspapers. But I didn't expect to run into you in the countryside. You are? Ushimastu Segawa. I'm a teacher at Iiyama Elementary School. Oh, so you're Mr. Segawa. The many letters that you've written... have been of great comfort. You must forgive my undue caution. I thought I was ready to die at any time, but maybe not. Please meet my wife. This is Mr. Segawa. Pleased to meet you. I read in the newspaper the other day... that you had fallen deathly ill. As you can see, I'm well enough to travel, so you needn't worry. I'm staying with a friend in the outcast section of Komoro. The innkeeper in the village wouldn't accommodate me. Walking in the mountains helps nourish my thoughts, but my wife worries that the mountain air is poor for my health. I don't know what to do with her! I saw the announcement for your new book, Record of Repentance. Yes, it should be available soon. To think that someday a thoughtful burakumin may read my book and say, "Look, a fellow named Inoko wrote this," that would be enough. That's the dream that keeps me going. I still want it. It's a puzzling coincidence: You entered the Nagano teachers' school after I quit. I was born in the south of Nagano. Students from the same area spread rumors that I was a burakumin, and... it turned into quite an uproar. I immediately confirmed that I was indeed a burakumin and left the school. In other words, I was expelled. I understand that you were studying to be a psychologist. I heard that you quit of your own free will. Me? That in a moment of inspiration, I decided to dedicate my life to the rights of burakumin? No, I hadn't the mettle for such ambitions. When I was a boy, the other children would make sport of me, throw rocks at me. I didn't understand. In middle school, it hit me that I had been born a burakumin, and I cursed my parents. I was angry that they had me, and raised me. I thought I'd have been better off having... no arms or legs than to be a burakumin. Where are you from? Komoro. Komoro? Really? Pardon me for asking, but are your parents still alive? My mother died when I was four. My father died some time ago. No brothers or sisters? I rushed here when I heard my uncle was critically ill. Fortunately, it was nothing, so I'm going home. I'm sorry for your troubles. We had a rally in Komoro last night. People shouted, "Who asked the opinion of a bunch of polluted people!" Scalawags always show up for these events. But even sadder than that, is when burakumin live by hiding their identity. They want to keep things quiet, but I pick at the scab until blood flows and they resent me. They feel small and persecuted, trapped in their haphazard lives. They close their eyes to reality. It doesn't even occur to these brethren to consider change to this disharmony. The power wielded by the movement is on the side of the burakumin. Don't you want to fight the good fight? Look... For better or worse, we're the ones who were educated, and we have a duty. I was once weak and, as a coward, hid my identity. Do you plan to live and die a coward? Mr. Inoko! How about it? I'm... not burakumin. I see... You must forgive me. You must be very angry. Can you forgive me? Sir, don't be absurd. It is I who must ask for your forgiveness. I sometimes get carried away. Since my health is doubtful, I never know when I might expire, and am desperate to find someone to whom I may pass the torch. Your letters were so very compassionate. This is why I tell you to at least wear socks. It's winter and you've caught a chill. May I come in? Mr. Segawa? In the name of the Buddha. I was wondering if you know if it's true that... Mr. Keinoshin Kazama was fired as a teacher. How did you know? So it is true. The abbot heard a rumor and was worried. Is Mr. Kazama a relative? - He's Shiho's real father. - Shiho? Shiho's mother died somehow, and she didn't get along with Mr. Kazama's second wife, so we let her live here as our daughter. - Really? - It was drink. My husband did everything in his power. Mr. Kazama vowed time after time to quit the bottle, but he never lasted. Finally, my husband gave up and told him not to come here til he gave it up for good. So what's the story about his four small children? They were born of other women. Shiho's half brothers and sisters. She had an older brother, but he died in this war. In the name of the Buddha. One! Two! Some of these are just chaff. The sparrows might've gotten some of it, but the weight is on target. 69kg... this is good, unshelled rice. But you didn't count the container weight. It's too late to weigh the container now. I'm sorry the sake's cold. Stop crying! Aren't you supposed to be the older brother? She took it and ate it. Shut up! I can't believe it. People who take things without asking are thieves! Get out of here, I can't raise such an unscrupulous child! Are you going to take six 40 liter bags? 40 liters? I'm taking 85 liters? 80 liters?! No, not 80. I'm taking 85 liters. Landlord, please take it all! - I don't need any of it! - Just a minute now... Forget it, I quit. I'm not sharecropping here anymore. I take care of everything around here, and the would-be breadwinner just sits around and drinks all the time. There's no way I can make ends meet. I give up! I can't take it! Disgraceful, weeping in front of a guest! I'll be back. As penitence, couldn't you stay home... and help me, just once a year? I may be living in a hovel now, but my family... once lived in a samurai residence near a castle on a prominent road. You want me to do the work of a peasant? I wasn't exactly penniless when I married you. I had a lot more clothes than your precious Shiho at Lotus Temple. If you won't till the land, why don't you be a bookkeeper for a bank? Have you forgotten I'm ill? An illness called laziness, caused by too much drink! I said, I'm sick. I'll be dead soon. That is to say, what becomes of people after they die? It's a question that no one could answer. The ancient gods of Shizuoka were incredibly devout men... who became the monks of Shibutani and formed their teachings. After the sixth year, they became gods and the protectors of our town of Iiyama. In the name of the Buddha. That's quite a group in there. The head priest is delivering a sermon. I left because I don't like it when so many people gather here. This town is strongly Buddhist. Aren't you going in to listen? - I never feel comfortable at temples. - It's cold out here. - Actually, I have something to tell you. - What is it? I asked about the natural sciences instructor position at Nagano teachers' college. Oh, the opening at Tokyo agricultural sciences university. Did you get it? Yes, the letter just arrived at the inn. - Congratulations. - Thank you. It means I can finally dedicate myself to botany without having to leave Nagano. I'll be leaving Iiyama at the end of the month. So it seems. You're leaving, too. I'm a bit envious. It's like I always told you, You'd have been snapped up ages ago, had you put in a request to the teachers' college, Then you could be teaching at junior high, or at a teacher's college. You're a much better teacher than I'll ever be. You're being wasted on primary school students. I prefer playful children that will listen to me. I'm satisfied with the tranquil lifestyle of a countryside teacher. I want it to be like this forever. Is that her? Kazawa's daughter. Yes, she's Shiho. She's cute. Mr. Segawa! I'm sorry to disturb you while you're studying. What can I do for you? I see you around the school quite frequently, but I've never had the opportunity to meet you. I'm Risaburo Takayanagi. Pleased to meet you, I'm Segawa. You're serving in quite an honored teaching position, so I'm sure that you spend little time involving yourself in worldly affairs, but elections are slippery events indeed, and you can't predict the outcome until it's over. You can't let your guard down, not even for a moment. I hope I can count on your support. I haven't the skills to assist in a campaign. I should've mentioned it before, but I heard your father died in a terrible accident, and I wanted to offer my sincerest condolences. Thank you, but I think... there's been some misunderstanding. My wife's relatives knew your father. Nobody knows about my wife's family. Nobody knows where you came from, other than my wife and me. Do you understand? Your wife's family? I trust you know Rokuzaemon from Komoro? He's the richest man in the area. Let's just say that I married a burakumin girl to finance my campaign. Please understand my circumstances. Otherwise, I'm prepared for you and I to stab each other and die right here! I give you my word on that. I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. My wife and I were on the same train... to Komoro when you went. Maybe you were on that train, but if so, I didn't notice you. Then do you continue to insist that you don't know what I'm talking about!? I don't know what you're talking about. If I lose this election, it will be the end of me. I beg of you, please don't tell people about my wife's family. I'll do anything I can in return. I've never gossiped about you before now, and I don't plan to in the future. Furthermore, I don't need any favors from you. That's all I needed to hear. Mr. Segawa, you have as much to lose as me. Please think about it. I didn't even know how to apologize! I could see that you were depressed, but I thought you were just upset about your family. It isn't the first time the abbot's malady has manifested itself this way. But I didn't think that he would lay a hand on you. It's pitiful. Mother, please don't worry. Whatever happens, I'll never let him touch. I'm going to send a letter to my sister in Nagano. I'm going to ask him for a divorce. Hopefully that will open his eyes. Were it not for that malady, he would be a fine abbot. Sorry to disappoint you, but we don't have anything today. Just some river fish and tofu drippings. That sounds fine. And a glass of sake. Hey, Segawa. What in the world brings you to a joint like this? I'll sit with you. Have a drink. That's a surprise... I never thought you'd buy me a drink. This fleeting life, like a dream Time just slips through your fingers. You think about tomorrow and the next day and pretty soon you're 50. Times have changed, too. I don't know what you think when you see the remains of the castle by Chikuma River. Covered in brambles and weeds. Mulberry fields on every side. All of the samurai living in poverty. Working in government offices. Or as school teachers, leading ultimately meaningless lives. Well, there's nothing as useless as a samurai. In truth, I was one of them. Even if your job is miserable, if you quit, you've nothing to do and you're kaput. You can kill time fishing. Grave: The Deceased, Keinoshin Kazama, Private First Class And nap all day when the weather's disagreeable. Thirsty, eh?! Are you going to cut loose tonight? I suppose moderation is best in all circumstances. No one would be surprised to see me drunk, - but when you drink, Segawa, people worry. - Why? Because you and I are different. I'm old. My life is over. But you're a young man, with a bright future. Shiho! Father! I apologize for the inconvenience. I know he's nothing but a nuisance. Shiho, what are you doing here? Father, there's no one here. - It's like no one lives here. - I'm fine on my own. Let's get you to bed. You've been drinking. They all left... They left me. One day, when I came home, no one was here. Back to her hometown, I guess. Those poor children! Ryukichi and Susumu, having to go to an unfamiliar home. What?! Their mother will raise them to be splendid peasants. I pity their mother, too. Take a good look at her. This is the kind of daughter I have. She's crying for a stepmother who hated her. She's just like her mother. Right down to her face and the look in her eyes. That was the main reason my second wife hated her. There was nothing that I could do about it. Father, I'd like to live here with you again. I could sew or do other work. What are you talking about? I plan never to return to Lotus Temple again. Segawa, did Shiho do something disgraceful? What happened? The abbot's wife said she would divorce him. - What he did to me... - The abbot?! Hey, Segawa, my wife used to complain constantly. She said that the abbot was a lecher. Such shameful behavior for a man of his position in the monastery. But even an animal wouldn't lay a hand... on his adopted daughter. Shiho, I want you to come back, but as you can see, this is how I am now. Iiyama is distinguished for the care it places on its temple. You could have a happy life there. I will always be grateful to the abbot and his wife... for raising me since I was 13 till now, but I will not return to Lotus Temple. I could never just leave you here... to live on your own. Father, I beg you. Please go to Lotus Temple tomorrow and tell them I'm living with you now. Shiho, there's sake on that shelf. Bring it here. Don't you think you should cut back a little? Recently, nothing goes down but sake. My stomach can't handle solid food. The doctor told me he couldn't find anything wrong. I don't have a fever. What do you think, Segawa? Do you want the daughter of a pauper? She's from a good samurai family. - If you want her, she's yours. - Father! I'm not of samurai stock. I'm the only one who cares about the samurai. My last wife was a peasant! Did you hear? - About that teacher, Mr. Segawa? - No, I didn't. They say he's a burakumin. I heard there's someone who can prove it, so there can be no doubt. - Who? - I shouldn't say. A councilman shouldn't speak too freely. Mr. Segawa, we don't have to study today, do we? No one else came, because of the snow! Mr. Segawa, let's play! Wait a little while longer. And try to keep quiet. Now go. Speech by Rentaro Inoko Essentially, this whole thing blew up because Mr. Segawa is just plain weird. This isn't a joke. We wouldn't put up with it if he were a burakumin. Townspeople like gossip. Rumors about all the teachers. - It just depends on the rumor. - Of course... That's why we can't afford to ignore this problem. Whenever I speak to Mr. Segawa about the burakumin, he always changes the topic. He dodges the issue and turns pale. Don't you think it's strange? He has seemed a bit melancholy recently. - They say you can tell a burakumin from his face. - Precisely! As outcasts from society, their dispositions are extremely warped. Such a fine young man could never be born of the burakumin. That alone should prove that he is not a burakumin. Mr. Tsuchiya, what then would you make of Mr. Rentaro Inoko? He's... an exception. Be logical. Then, Mr. Segawa is an exception, too. If you can tell from the face, that would make you the one. Yes, your face is very swarthy. - And extremely foppish. - How absurd! Accusing me of being a burakumin! You never could take a joke. Mr. Segawa, haven't you researched Rentaro Inoko's writings extensively? Just what kind of a man is he? He's not a philosopher, or an educator, or a clergyman... - He's a freethinker! - A freethinker?! If you ask me, he's a daydreamer. In fact, he's some kind of a madman! Give it a rest... You always get worked up when you talk about Rentaro Inoko. Let's go outside. It's because you're suffering inside, tortured by your own thoughts, that people misunderstand you. That you could be a burakumin... What if I were a burakumin?! Get a hold of yourself! The school checks where teachers are from before hiring them. These rumors are completely groundless. Just talk to me. You've no reason to keep secrets from me. Talk about what? What's bothering you and every other young man: Love. Love? I noticed that you suddenly moved to Lotus Temple, and that you've been glum ever since. I understand that Shiho has a sordid history. That was the time that you became dejected, wasn't it? We went to the same teachers' college, and we're posted at the same school. Why don't you level with me? If you open up and ask my advice, maybe I can't help, but I'll try. I've had such feelings before. But, the truth is... she died a long time ago. That's what it is. She's dead. I don't think I could ever feel that way again. I can't. That's all I can tell you now. Forgive me. All of the teachers at the school speak highly of you. But some people in the town no longer... wish to send their children here. I apologize for this commotion. On the contrary, we understand that this must be difficult. We are simply concerned for you. Thank you. The truth is that I have noticed telltale signs... once or twice in his behavior. But I cannot simply leap to the conclusion that it's due to his lineage... and fire him right on the spot. On the other hand, I cannot stand by as parents, students, and even other teachers, nurture rumors about him. Perhaps if he requested to transfer... to another school, this matter could be solved quietly. I understand completely the spot you're in. The school's honor must not be compromised. Rentaro Inoko In a sluggish economy, these books won't sell. I'll take the English-language book. But these are brand new. I haven't even read them. I don't know what to say... I'll give you 55 sen for the lot. 55 sen? I'll take it. I guess I took you by surprise. I should have told you I was coming. My wife said as much. I didn't know that you'd moved here, so I stopped by the boarding house... in Takasho City before I came here. Is something the matter, Mr. Segawa? You must be sick. You're shaking. You seem feverish. You must sit down. I only intended to see you briefly. Who... who are you? Me? I'm Inoko: Rentaro Inoko. I'm Segawa... I'm not sure if you have the wrong person, but I've never met you before. Your name sounds familiar... I do believe that I've read your books, but I've never met you before, and at any rate, I don't know you. Mr. Segawa. I've made a terrible mistake. There are many who are sympathetic to us burakumin... And we gratefully accept their sympathy. We do so because their understanding and sympathy... more than anything gives us strength. Still, I'm always careful. Depending too much on people's sympathy and compassion... makes one feel like a beggar with his hand out. There's something that I'm even more cautious of: that is being so vigilant of avoiding stooping to the level of a beggar... that I become hard-hearted and rebuff innocent acts of kindness. I've made doubly sure to be alert to both dangers, but it seems I have again made a mistake somewhere. I'm sorry that you went out in the cold to look for someone that you... were unable to find. I'm sorry; there must be many people with the same name. There must be many people who look alike. My eyesight has suffered since I fell ill. I often mistake people for others. It's a nuisance for people dear to me. It's sad. I'll let myself out. You don't seem well. Please take care. What are you doing here? I came to greet the guest, but he had already left. Mr. Segawa, you should rest. Did something happen to him? Maybe the flu. He's a bit shy, but we should have adopted someone like him. We should've gotten a son from the start. Shut up! I don't need your sarcasm. I'm not being sarcastic. If we don't have someone to take care of us, what will become of us? It's raining again. What happened!? What is it?! Has someone gone to fetch the police? Mr. Inoko! - Who is it? - Who knows? He's your guest; we'll leave him with you for now. He was with attorney Murakami. He left right after the incident. So, he's not my guest. If you leave him here, all of my other customers will leave. The police are busy investigating this incident, and we can't just leave him outdoors. I knew it had to be something like this. I don't mind keeping the body. When my husband had a relapse in Komoro, a man named Murakami helped us greatly. I understand he's a lawyer from Ueda. He did so much for us, but my husband became involved with the election. I only found out later... but Mr. Murakami is running against Mr. Takayanagi... in the upcoming Iiyama election. He was trying to use my husband. I told him, but he said he didn't care. Mr. Takayanagi had married a burakumin girl... just to get at her rich father's money. He said that it would be worth it... just to expel such a base man from politics. He left early this morning for a campaign speech... Letter of Resignation I hear the killer was hired by Mr. Takayanagi, because his wife was a burakumin. It's more frightful to think of Inoko exposing that fact at a campaign speech. Still, Inoko was an important man. Children, I have an announcement. - An announcement?! - An announcement! This will be my last day teaching you. I have to say goodbye to you all. I think you all know... in these mountains, there are five types of people: Former samurai, merchants, farmers, clergymen, and there's a group called the burakumin". Even now, burakumin live in groups separate from the town, and some of them work as farmers. Those who work as farmers conduct what they call pilgrimages. Once a year, they visit their fathers and grandfathers with a sheaf of rice and check on their wellbeing. I'm sure you know that if they visit your house, they are to eat from special bowls on a dirt floor, and under no circumstances to set one foot past the threshold into the living quarters. And if an errand takes you to the burakumin neighborhood, you can accept a cigarette, but you are by no means to accept a cup of tea. Such is the lowly position of the burakumin. If a burakumin came into this classroom and taught... language and geography, how would you feel? The truth is... I'm a burakumin. You're not adults, but you're also not so young that you... have no understanding of the matters of this world, Please remember what I've told you. In the future, after 5 or 10 years, when you look back on your days in primary school, please remember that you once had a teacher named Segawa, when you were in the fourth grade, and when he revealed his status as a burakumin, said goodbye, and left. He drinks spiced sake on New Year's Day just like me, and on the emperor's birthday he sings the national anthem, and he said that he would pray for our good fortune. Also, that the reviled burakumin, like you, were born into this world... as defenseless, innocent babies, and remain the same as you until their dying day. Please remember that I plainly explained that... we're neither monsters, nor animals. I... As your teacher, I've tried to... teach you how to think clearly. To stay on the straight and narrow path and never to lie. For this reason, I'm ashamed that I hid the fact that I am a burakumin. Please, forgive me! I will probably never teach again. The days I've spent with you all in the... three years I've been at this school, are probably the happiest in my life. Walking along the Chikuma River with you singing; shoveling snow together after the blizzard; losing at tennis; marveling at how quickly you grow. They are a flood of memories for me. This classroom and... how all of you smell like the sun on dry grass. Your healthy faces in your fine school uniforms. These are memories I will never forget. You made a person like me... your friend for such a long time. I would like to express my gratitude. Thank you. Thank you very much. When you get home, please tell your parents about me. Tell them... I'm sorry that I concealed that I'm a burakumin. Please tell them that I told you everything. Forgive me! What's wrong? - Mr. Segawa admitted to being a burakumin. - He told his fourth grade class. He knelt and apologized, telling them never to discriminate. Let's go! Forgive me! What are you saying? Get a hold of yourself! Letter of Resignation You're ready to quit?! I understand. I know how you feel. Leave everything to me! You stay here! Father, it's all done now. You made sure I was educated. I learned to feel free. That freedom cost you your life. You spent your life buried in the mountains, and I betrayed your wish. I abandoned Mr. Inoko, and he died as a result. Today, I've abandoned my father, and when I cry, I can no longer carry your memory in my heart. I am alone. I abandon my name, love, and spend my life wandering as an act of contrition for my transgression. Father, what do you need? It's heavy... My chest is heavy. This blanket isn't enough to keep you from catching a cold. Is that better? I'm sorry to intrude, but I'm looking for Mr. Segawa. Mr. Segawa? No. That's strange. I wonder where he went. Did something happen to him? He left school, but hasn't returned to the Lotus Temple. I thought he might be here. - I'll go with you. - To where? To look for him. Thank you. Segawa! Are you all right? He can't be dead, can he? It would be so tragic. I can't imagine his suffering. Mr. Segawa didn't get to choose... his mother and father. Shiho, you have to help Mr. Segawa. He was fond of you... But because of his lineage, he abandoned thoughts of you. I don't know what to say, but I've already decided to be with him. - For the rest of your life? - Yes. His hands are like ice. Miss Shiho... You'll freeze to death out here! I can never make this up to you. No, it is I who must apologize. If I had been even a little understanding of your situation, you would have told me first. Since I aspire to be a botanist, I can't lie and say that I don't understand nature as it is. Casually dividing up humanity into classes, and putting the burakumin on the bottom rung. It makes me sick that I never doubted it for a moment! I couldn't blame you if you hate me. Please forgive me! Mr. Tsuchiya! I just learned everything from Shiho... She wanted to help look for you without even asking why. When I told her what happened at school today, she just said that she felt badly for you. She also said that... she's ready to spend the rest of her life with you. Shiho, that's impossible. I'm touched by the sentiment, but I can't let you get involved in the miserable future that awaits me. But... Mr. Inoko married. What about her? I understand that she isn't a burakumin. Really? I saw it in Record of Repentance. Did you read it? When Mr. Segawa came to the temple, I knew that he was reading it, and I borrowed it. Mr. Inoko's wife's mother was deadset against the marriage, but her father eventually gave implicit approval. He endured painful gossip at his job as a government official till retirement. A woman can get her way if she is determined. It will be a long, sad trip with my husband's remains. I'm glad that you're coming with me. But Mr. Segawa, why did you resign as a teacher? I don't think there was any reason for you to confess. If people spread rumors about you being a burakumin, then they're still just rumors. If people ask you to your face whether you're burakumin, avoid answering. Then you won't be lying. That's all you had to do. I don't mean to be rude, but if you're not a burakumin, the whole thing must seem incredibly simple. It says in the constitution that all people are equal. My husband said that burakumin were normal people, and that it was wrong to discriminate against them. If that's the case, then why conform to the errant convictions of others? If you're a normal person, why not live like one? When I think of my husband, I have no regrets. He couldn't forget the hatred of being born a burakumin till his dying day. That's probably what made him dedicate himself to the rights of the burakumin. I guess I wanted a more ordinary husband. But it's because of men like your husband... that people's attitudes change. They say that history is not borne of the unwashed masses, but from the deeds of great men. I disagree... Maybe it's because I'm a woman, and detest violence. I do believe that a day will come when this problem will cease to exist... And not because other activists like my husband will take up the cause, but in the natural flow of time. I don't believe in such dreams. Really? You claim that all of society scorns the burakumin, and yet Mr. Tsuchiya, Shiho, the abbot, and even his wife... all learned that you were burakumin, but their feelings didn't change a bit. Even in your narrow circle of acquaintances, there are several such people. If you checked around Iiyama, I'm sure you'd find more. If you checked around the whole country, still more. Of course, some people will stand in your way, but it's the same for everyone. Normal people accept hardship... as the natural course of things. You must accept that suffering is a part of life... and not blame it on being a burakumin. - You mean, keep a stiff upper lip? - Yes. And not to become an activist like your husband? Yes. But do I have to stay in Iiyama? I don't think I can go to Tokyo with you. When I was a young girl, I worked at a nursery school. I'd like to return to that school, if possible. Tokyo will bring endless misery. I understand. Would you like to come? Mr. Tsuchiya, I'd like to have a farewell party for you. When would be convenient? I don't need a farewell party. Least of all because I'm not quitting. I'm not going to Tokyo. Why not? Just yesterday, you were still planning to go. Why are you not allowing the children to see off Mr. Segawa? Is it because of his lineage? And in my case, I get a party for being the nephew of the County Educational Supervisor? Watch your tongue, Mr. Tsuchiya! My uncle is a conventional man, but he detests irrational thinking. You tell the students you're doing all in your power to keep Mr. Segawa here, but the fact is, you're treating him as if on holiday and have written him off! If I appeal to my uncle, what do you think he'll do?! Are you blackmailing me? You have absolutely no understanding of your students! I pity them! That's why I'm not leaving this school! Mr. Tsuchiya, listen up... The first criteria for engaging in a teaching position in a regional area is... an understanding of the common man. I couldn't serve in this post if I just... dedicated myself to higher thought and avoided vulgar interests. At dinners, I must sit with Buddhist monks and Shinto priests, learn customs of drinking local sakes, and use the regional dialect passably. Otherwise, I'd be shunned. I'll concede that I no longer think as an educator. I placed a higher priority on my position. Looking back, I remember my... boundless enthusiasm for education when I was young. It gives a man pause. Let me carry it. That's not necessary. It looks heavy. I was just thinking... Are human bones really this heavy? Or is it the urn that they're in? Did you meet Mr. Inoko when you were at the nursery school? It seems so very long ago. It also feels just like yesterday. I think I want to take the mantle from Mr. Inoko, but I don't think I could ever aspire to his level of success. Still, I can't suppress my desire... to spend my life following in his footsteps. I apologize for disregarding your advice, but this is the path for me. I don't know why I'm crying. Despite my adamant protests, when I think of how happy my husband would have been... He would have been so proud. He has a fine successor, and even if I can't understand the machinations of a man's heart, thank you. I'd like to thank you on his behalf. Please excuse me. I didn't think we'd make it in time. Is it really true that you're leaving? Isn't Tokyo far away? Will you ever come back to Iiyama? I'll be away for a while. Iiyama is my second home. I'm sure I will return. I loved this dictionary. It's in poor shape now, but use it at the school. Mr. Segawa, here's some hardboiled eggs. My mother made them for you. Isn't that Shiho? Thank you. Excuse me. How's your father? He spits out solid food. Water is the only thing that goes down. He's been asleep all morning. That's the bell of the Lotus Temple. I said goodbye at the Mountain Gate. The abbot's wife gave me wooden prayer beads as a going away present. Shota made them. She also gave me some grass sandals with covers, for walking in the snow. That's probably Shota ringing the bell. Everyone's lives change, but Shota just stays the same. He has no family, no wife, no children... Shiho, if I call for you from Tokyo, ...would you come? - Yes. You must be Shiho. This is of tattered and of no value, but you'll need it until you get to the train. How kind. Thank you. Thanks for everything. Thank you. I thought that it would be you who saw me off. Life's funny. I'll see you in Tokyo. You sure will. Until then. Goodbye! Ushimatsu left Iiyama in December 1904, the first year of the Ruso-Japanese War. THE END Translation: scannon Timing: lordretsudo
