Money in the kitchen Money in the hall Got more money than Cash McCall He's got money I've got none Put him in the jailhouse just for fun Come on, now, get out of here. You think you're in a park? Come on. Come on, now. No, no, let's go, now. - Come on. Come on, now. - You're mean. Now, get out of here. Come on. One at a time. What do you mean, you can't reach McCall? - You're his lawyer. - Not his nursemaid. Mr. Conway, will McCall be going to Mr. Thompkins' funeral? Mr. McCall hardly knew Mr. Thompkins. He knew him enough to get control of his business. That's why Thompkins committed suicide. An assumption. You don't know why he committed suicide. Do you know? I know nothing of the man's personal life. I can't guess at motives. - I assume there were some. - Why do you assume so? Other people lost their businesses and haven't jumped out of windows. Do you keep a list of those who do and don't? I'll ignore that question. Let me say this in all fairness to Mr. McCall: All of his actions in reference to Mr. Thompkins... ...and the Thompkins Lamp Company have been 100 percent legal. There is a difference between legal and moral. I'm not a moralist, I'm a lawyer. Now that Mr. McCall has control of the Thompkins Company... ...what does he plan to do with it? Spin it off? Throw a whole town out of work? You'll have to ask Mr. McCall. That brings us back to the original question. - Where is Mr. McCall? - I don't know where he is. - Why don't you try his office? - His office? That's a laugh. He hasn't been near that place in years. That's his privilege. Boys, this is where we came in. This is where I go out. - Thank you, Mr. Conway. - Thank you very much. Does he remind you of...? Try his hotel. See if he's arrived yet. Try Mr. McCall's private number again at the Hotel Ivanhoe. - Yes, sir. - I'm gonna have it out with him. He's sticking his neck too far out, exposing himself unnecessarily. What he needs is somebody to front for him. Somebody who can at least look respectable. What you mean is a fall guy. A patsy. Well, yes. You have a sharp mind. Criminal but sharp. Good morning, Mr. McCall. Oh, Mrs. Kennard, wonderful breakfast. - We must make this an institution. - Thank you, Mr. King. I don't think you've met our president, General Danvers. This is Mrs. Kennard, assistant manager of the hotel. How do you do? Mrs. Kennard arranged our breakfast for us this morning. Well, Mrs. Kennard, you're the prettiest mess sergeant I ever saw. - Excuse me. - Of course. - We open up on Grant Austen today, sir? - We do, indeed. We shell the beaches and move right in. Good morning, general, Mr. King. - Mrs. Kennard. - See you. - What is it? - Mr. McCall just went up. I know Mr. McCall just went up. I wish you'd get it through your head. He's a guest in this hotel, not a manager. Neither are you, sister. Do I know him? No. Have you got a minute to step into my office? Hmm. - What's wrong, Mr. Pierce? - That was a government agent. Hmm? - Federal Bureau of Internal Revenue. - Huh? They're investigating Cash McCall. He said it was just a routine investigation, but he didn't fool me. Why? What was he asking about? Does Mr. McCall occupy a nine-room penthouse? Does he pay a thousand dollars a month rent? Did he have it completely done over at his own expense? Do his phone calls go through our switchboard? And why not? Does he use his suite for business purposes, for entertaining? And we've got to protect the hotel. Mr. Atherson and the people at the bank, they wouldn't want any scandal. Well, I wouldn't worry. There was talk at the Kefauver investigations... ...about where Costello got his hair cut. - The Waldorf-Astoria. - Well, they're still doing business. I'll tell you what, let's get a Lockwood on him. - Lockwood? - Lockwood report. Tells you everything you wanna know about a man. Financially, personally, socially. Even tells you how many fillings he's got in his back teeth. How do they do it? Detectives? - Well, I suppose so. - No. - No, that sounds too risky to me. - Don't you worry about a thing. Handle this discreetly. The hotel cannot afford-- Of course, don't worry. - Mr. Austen, I hate to bother you-- - Get to the point. - Well, Schofield Instrument called again. - Gil, I'll be with you in just one minute. Excuse me. Now, what's this about Schofield Instrument? They called about that television cabinet they want us to make. General Danvers is putting the pressure on. - If we're not interested-- - I'm not interested. Danvers may be out of his mind, but I'm not. I'm not gonna mortgage everything, put in presses... ...without even a guarantee as to how many cabinets they're going to buy. Well, would you like to talk to them? Jim King's on my line now. Uh.... Miss Burkes, give me that call on Mr. Bronson's line. Jim, it's Grant Austen. Yes, Mr. Austen, how are you? Fine. Fine, thank you. Jim, about this new T-21 console cabinet... ...you are going to have to tell General Danvers-- I'm with General Danvers now. You wanna talk to him? Sure, sure, you bet. Put him on. Austen, what about my television cabinet? What are you people trying to do, hold up the wheels of progress? Well, there are a few little points that still have to be worked out. Now, this new television cabinet you want... ...we'd need to put in a 2500-ton press to turn out a job like that. So? You've put in new presses before. Well, sure, you know, but the press that we're talking about... ...this is an investment of-- Well, of at least a quarter of a million dollars. That's lot of money to spend without some guarantee... ...as to how many cabinets you'll buy. Guarantee? From us? Austen, do you realize that 60 percent of your business comes from us? Well, I realize that. Sure, yes, sir. But nobody, nobody would put in that much new equipment-- Austen, let's not say that nobody would. I don't follow you. I, uh.... I have a letter before me... ...from the Heckendorf Molding Company in Newark. Heckendorf is eager to take what you call a gamble. All right, ahem, let them have it. Of course... ...there's just one little consideration that they want in return. They want all the rest of our business. Business that normally goes to you. That's a pretty outrageous bluff. It's not a bluff and there's nothing outrageous about it. Look, Austen, I'll tell you what I'll do. Suppose I put off calling Heckendorf until, well, let's say the first of the week. Give you a few days to think it over. Yes, yes. He's gotta be bluffing. He's just gotta be bluffing. Well, if he isn't, it means the end of us. He went for it. Sell your company, huh? I have your banker... ...Mr. Atherson, on the line. - Hi, Will. - Hi, Grant. I was wondering what you're doing for lunch tomorrow. Oh, nothing very stimulating. Why? A few things on the Schofield situation I'd like to sound you out on... ...if you've got the time. How about 1:00 over at the Ivanhoe? In the lobby. I'll meet you at 1:00. Fine. Thank you, Will. Yes, Mr. Austen? Will you ask Mr. Clark to come in? Oh, thank you. Well, it looks as though they've got you on the run today. That idea you had on taxes. I went over it with our tax man. He doesn't think they're gonna allow it. No, let's not go into that. If you don't listen to the advice of your business consultants... ...I don't know why you pay us a $5000 retainer. Don't worry about that, Gil. There's something else I'd like to get your slant on. Strictly in confidence... ...what would you say if I told you I was thinking of selling the company? Selling? Selling, yes, yes. I've been behind this desk for over 30 years now, Gil... ...and I've worked hard at it, and I've got a lot to show for it. I built this factory from two little presses to what we've got now... ...and, well, I think it's about time that I was getting out. Getting out and enjoying the years I have left to me. What do you think? I'd say it was worth considering. I wouldn't sell unless I could make the right kind of a deal. If it's all right with you, I'd like to mention it to Harrison Glenn. You know, even if you have a deal brewing already... ...it takes more than one bidder to get the price up. It was Austen himself who opened the subject? - That's right, sir. - Mm-hm. And you said...? I told him it was worth considering. Do you know why he wants to sell? I think he's running out of gas. You wouldn't sell, would you? No, sir, I wouldn't. What you'd really like is a crack at managing the company yourself. You have to watch that. It's like a doctor falling in love with a patient. You handled this extremely well, Gil. I think I've got Austen a buyer. What do you know about Cash McCall? Cash McCall? Do you know him? I know the type. What type is that? Vulture, sir. Jackals. They prowl around looking for a good company that's having a little difficulty... ...buy it up for practically nothing, and then they start pulling it to pieces. Close the plant down, spin it off for a tax loss. They throw a whole community out of work just to make a fast buck. I'd sure hate to see one of those ruthless characters... ...get his fat destructive hands on Austen Plastics. Your opinion of Mr. Cash McCall... ...is a matter of complete indifference to all concerned... ...because you've never even met the man. Yes, sir. But you will. You're having lunch with him tomorrow. One o'clock, Hotel Ivanhoe. You know, Lory, when I try to explain things to you and make them clear... ...that helps me to make them clear for myself. And it doesn't really happen that way with anybody else. Think you could get what the company's worth? Well, Gil Clark thinks that a million and a half is the least we could get for it. - We might even get 2 million dollars. - Wow. - That's a lot of money. - Yes, isn't it? It depends on our finding the right buyer, of course. But a million and a half, that's not to be sneezed at. Mm-hm? Dad, do you think you could be happy without the company? Well, Lory, I am the company. It's getting to be too much. You know what's it like running a company like ours now? - It's like-- - Let somebody else take over the grief. It's too much for you and it's too much for Mother. Anyway, you both ought to be off someplace having a good time again. Yes, and it's not as though I were saving the company for a son to carry on. Or a son-in-law. I'm sorry, baby. I'm very sorry. No, Dad, it doesn't matter. Well, of course it does. It matters a great deal. I don't know what happened up in Maine last summer, but whatever it was... ...you have got to put that whole experience out of your mind. You'll find someone else. Forget it, Dad, really. - Mother? - Yes, dear. - Hi. - Hi. Not disturbing you, am I? Mm-mm. I have to stop pretty soon anyhow. I'm driving into Philadelphia. - Oh? - Yeah, I have a luncheon date. And then I have to pick Dad up and drive him back. Luncheon date? Anyone interesting? Oh, some people at the publisher's. Business. This time, they want me to illustrate a book about space travel. Space travel for children, of course. It seems so odd to have a daughter who's an artist. Well, don't brood about it, Mother. I'm just an illustrator. It's very striking. Very striking, indeed. I think you're right not to take your painting too seriously. There are so many important things in life. It's pleasant work and they pay well. There's nothing wrong with women having careers. When I was your age, I was already married. I've decided I'm not gonna get married until quite late in life. When I'm 24, say... ...or maybe even 25. All I'm saying is that you ought to get out more. Do things. See people of your own age. Young people, Lory. - Oh, Lory. - It's all right, Mother. - Just awkward of me. - No, no, it's okay. - I'm so sorry. - No, it's just a bunch of old sketches. Not even worth keeping, really. It's just that I want you to meet someone you'll love, Lory. And when you do, I want you to drop everything else. Go with him wherever he goes. I'll do my best. I don't know why I'm being so gloomy. It must be something in the air. Come, now. A few more days and you'll both be at the convention... ...and you'll have the beach and the hot sun... ...and you'll feel like a new woman. Why don't you go somewhere for a holiday? You haven't been anywhere since you got back from Maine last summer. I better hurry up and change. Bye. I'll see you later. Mr. McCall's room number, please. May I have your name? Gilmore Clark. Mr. McCall, please. Mr. McCall, I'm sorry to trouble you. There's a Mr. Gilmore Clark to see you, sir. Yes, sir. Very good, sir. You may go up. Tenth floor. And the room number? Mr. McCall occupies the entire floor and part of the ninth. - Mr. McCall, please-- - Gil Clark, I'm Cash McCall. Come in. Yours, I'd say, would be a martini? Nothing at all. Thank you. You shouldn't make an important decision in such a hurry. It's your duty to make a good impression. That's what martinis are for. Gilmore Clark. Is Gilmore a family name? That's right. My mother's maiden name. Well, at least it's harmless. My mother's maiden name was Cash. Oh. I always assumed.... Most people do. Tell me, Gil, what do you know about me? Not much. - None of it good, huh? - Well-- There's no need to get your guard up. Not yet. Is that dry enough? I'm sort of a secondhand dealer. I buy old tired companies and whip them into shape, and then sell them again. - What's your line of work? - Corporation Associates. We're management consultants. That's a prissy way of saying efficiency experts, isn't it? I mean, you go out to a company with a slide rule and an Ouija board... ...you sit off to one side in the shade and tell them how to run it by the book. We can usually see more from the sidelines... ...than they can from the middle of the field. Well, that's nice. It's like going to a ball game and having the players pay you. And they pay you pretty well, I hear. Our fees are big. But when we charge our clients thousands, we save them millions. And we have a waiting list a mile long... ...because my firm operates strictly on the level. And do you know why it operates that way? Because I own it. Sit down. Hadn't you guessed? No, I hadn't. At least now you're certain your worst suspicions are confirmed. I wouldn't say that. But you do feel my position is slightly unethical. Well, I'm surprised, naturally. In case there's any doubt in your mind, I don't belong to the better circles. I'm a thoroughly vulgar character. I enjoy making money. Come on, let's eat. Have you any other prospects lined up? Oh, yes, yes. Gil Clark has someone that he thinks might be interested. Gil Clark? - That's Corporation Associates? - Yes, yes. - You know, they have a lot of contacts-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Grant, when are you gonna drive back to the country? Well, Lory's picking me up here at 3 this afternoon. Why? Oh, I just thought I might have a buyer. Uh.... Look, have you an asking price in mind? Two million dollars. Two million? Heh. That's a little steep, isn't it? Well, not for asking, no. Look, if anybody offers you 2 million, you grab it. Who's your prospect, Will? Well, I can't tell you that now. But, look, if I had your authority to go ahead... ...well, I could find out if he's in town. Shall I? Well, certainly. Sure, you go right ahead. Waiter, check, please. Well, what do you think? - About what? - Going to work for me. As far as I can see, I've been working for you for some time. Well, this wouldn't be quite the same. You'd leave Corporation Associates. I'm afraid I'm a little vague about what my job would be. What you do now is, you go into a company... ...and try to find out what's wrong with it? That's usually the starting point. Well, that'd be the starting point with us too. When there's a company for sale, there's always a reason. There's always something wrong. The tax structure we have now sets everything up like pins in a bowling alley. You take your small manufacturer like Mr. Austen. The only way that he can cash in is by selling out. And the tax situation, or rather because of it, the country is full of Mr. Austens. I'm sorry, Gil, I don't make the rules. I just play the game. From what I know about Austen Plastics, Austen is tired. He's also overloaded with Schofield Instrument business. And General Danvers can make it tough on him any time he wants to. You still think it's a good property? With the right management, it can be operated at a very good profit. I don't buy businesses to operate them. I thought you understood that. I buy them to sell. Put those right over there, on the right. Excuse me. Oh. Heh. We had this set of Royal Norwegian that wasn't in use... - ...so I thought I'd bring it up for you. - Oh, fine, oh.... This is our assistant manager.... - Maude Kennard. - Gilmore Clark. - Hello, Mr. Clark. - How do you do? Nice to meet you. These are more personal, don't you think? Yes. If there's anything you want, let me know, Mr. McCall, any time. Well, thank you very much. She's attractive. Mm-hm. I may be interested in buying this plastics factory and I may not. I don't know. At the moment, I'm interested in you. I don't even know whether I like you or not. That's your problem. I don't hire people to like me. I hire them to work for me. I want to tackle something bigger than anything I've done. I'll need help. I need somebody to feed me ideas, to follow through on detail... ...pick up the ball if I fumble. And kind of warn me in case I commit a foul. I really don't know what to say. This is my unlisted telephone number. It's the only way you can reach me. If you decide you wanna talk, give me a call. What about Grant Austen? What do I tell him when he calls? Tell him you got a buyer, but don't tell him who. Get him to quote a firm price. We don't wanna haggle. And don't be too disappointed if I turn it down. We can't buy them all. Gil, in case you are interested in switching hats... ...your salary will be $25,000 a year. - Father, I'm sorry if I kept you waiting. - Hi, honey. - Hi. - Keep your fingers crossed, Lory. Atherson thinks he might have a buyer. He's talking to him right now. - A buyer? - For the company. And if I get my price, your share alone could come to almost $200,000. - That's incredible. - Of course not. Between the shares that your grandfather left you... ...and what I've been taking out of your allowance... ...you own almost 10 percent. Well, I am very impressed. Uh, Grant. - Hello, Lory. - Hello, Uncle Will. He'll be here in a second. We haven't seen much of you lately. I was talking to Mrs. Atherson-- Oh, excuse me, I've got to call Gil Clark. Grant, I'm afraid you'll have to do it later. Here's our man now. - Glad I caught you. - Hello. Cash McCall, Grant Austen. - Mr. McCall. Pleasure. - How do you do, sir? My daughter, Lory. - Miss Austen and I have met before. - Oh? Yes, we have. Oh, you two are old friends, huh? Ha-ha-ha. That's good. Fine. - Do you have a minute to spare, sir? - Sure, you bet. I think we can speak better in my suite. Oh, surely. - Oh, Father, I'll wait for you here. - Well, no, nothing doing. You're practically an officer of the company. - If you have no objections, Mr. McCall. - Not at all. Let me know how you make out. Sure, sure, Will, you bet. Thanks. Care to sit down? Well, well. Heh. This is a real pretty place you got here. Who's your decorator? The cheapest one I could find, me. Gil Clark tells me you may be interested in selling your company. - Would you care for a drink? - No, no, thank you. - Miss Austen? - No, thank you. Gil Clark? I thought Will Atherson told you that. While you were having lunch with Atherson... ...I was having lunch with Gil Clark. Mr. Austen, you have been a client of Corporation Associates... ...for several years, haven't you? Oh, yes, yes, indeed. They're very fine people. Well, there's something I think I ought to tell you before we go on. I own the controlling interest in Corporation Associates. You do? Well.... I'll be darned. I'd like you to tell me something, unless you'd rather not. No. Anything. Schofield people, General Danvers, how interested are they in buying you out? Well, I think that's more a question... ...of how interested I'd be in what they have to offer. They'd want me to take stock. I don't want stock. We're only interested in an outright sale. Aren't we, Lory? Yes. I see. You want cash. - Yes, cash. - How much cash? Two million dollars. And that includes all the stock? Yes, yes. That includes all the stock in the company. Lory here owns about 10 percent and I own the rest of it. And Miss Austen is in favor of the sale? If I weren't, I wouldn't be here. I don't know whether you saw our year-end statement. I gave Gil Clark a copy of it last week. But that will give you the complete picture on Austen Plastics. No change since the statement was drawn? Except profits since the first of the year? Well, uh-- No. Well, good enough. When you're ready to hand over the stock... ...I'm ready to hand over the $2 million. If you want to call someone, your lawyer, there's a telephone right through there. Well, yes, I will. I'll phone. Excuse me. Lory, you've gotta listen to me. There's something I-- - Don't bother. - Don't bother? Let's leave things the way they were... ...before we happened to bump into each other. Happened? Yes, you haven't thought about me since last summer. And I certainly haven't thought about you. You haven't? Let go of my arm. Me, Maine, everything, you just swept it all out of your mind? Let go of my arm. Well, go ahead, call your father. That's your work, isn't it? That's your signature? Where did you...? Who's it supposed to be, Abraham Lincoln? Lory, you have to listen to me. I can explain. This whole thing is a stupid mistake. - I've kicked myself-- - Oh, I'll bet you have. I'll bet you're just black and blue all over. Poor suffering Cash McCall. Well, please, don't tell me your sad story... ...because I'm still laughing from the last time we met. I tried several times, but he must still be out to lunch. - Where's Lory? - She suddenly remembered something. I think she plans to meet you down in the lobby. - Oh. - Now, if you'd like to call me later on.... No, I don't really need to talk to anybody. You've made me a good offer and I'm ready to accept it. All right, sir, you've made yourself a deal. Oh, you'll be hearing from my lawyer, Winston Conway. If you need any help on a tax breakdown, Conway's the best man in the business. - He'll be glad to give you a hand. - Well, thank you. We'll be taking over the first of the month. That'll give us a week. So I'll send Conway, Gil Clark and few others for a fast audit. Good. I wanna say this, Mr. McCall, you've bought yourself a good company. - I'm happy if you're happy, Mr. Austen. - I couldn't be happier. Good afternoon, sir. Goodbye. - Wait here. - Yes, sir. Good morning. I must apologize... - Isn't there any way of losing you? - ...for barging in like this. I was driving by, and I thought, while I was in the neighborhood-- Dad. It's your Mr. McCall. Well, for pity's sake. - How do you do, sir? - Fine. Miriam, you've heard me speak of Mr. McCall. - This is Mrs. Austen. - How do you do? My daughter you already know. Yes. I had a few things I wanted to go over with you. I thought I'd save you the trip downtown. - If you'll excuse me, please. - No, please don't go. You're the main reason I'm here. Your 10 percent of the stock. Oh. Oh, well, let's go into the library. I have a cab waiting outside. I was on my way to the airport from here. Why, that's only over the hill. Lory can run you there in no time. - Well, in that case-- - Sure, sure, that's a fine idea. - I'll take care of the cab. - Thank you. Shall we go into the library and be comfortable? Miss Austen? Mr. McCall, may I get you something? A cup of coffee? Oh, no, thank you. Mr. Conway tells me you're planning a trip around the world. Oh, heavens, no. Lory's been talking about going to Europe. Mr. Austen and I are only going to the plastics convention. My husband was so pleased with how quickly everything was settled. I hope you haven't found something that needs to be changed. No, everything is just fine. Mr. McCall, I said to Miriam yesterday when we got home... ...you remind me of somebody, and I can't for the life of me remember who. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you, sir. Well, sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Mr. Austen... ...it seems part of your daughter's stock came from her grandfather's estate. - That was my father. - That's right, yes. As I told Mr. Conway, I gave my father-in-law a block of stock... ...with the agreement it was to come back to Lory after his death. I see. I assume it's been approved by the probate court. Oh, sure, sure, you bet. Well, it seems I've made a trip for nothing. Mrs. Austen, I wanna thank you for asking me in. We must have you to dinner soon. I'd love to meet Mrs. McCall. - Well, I'd love to meet her myself. - Oh. Lory, you're driving Mr. McCall to the airport. It would be very kind of you, Miss Austen. Not at all. I'll bring the car around. - Sorry to put you to all this trouble. - No trouble at all. A man like that for Lory. Oh? Do you want me to drop you at the terminal or one of the gates? I'm a normal, healthy American boy. I don't wanna be dropped at all. You don't seem to understand, I'm pursuing you. That's a wholesome change, isn't it? She's a hardhearted woman. But she's awfully pretty. And she's awfully bored with the conversation. Well, it probably doesn't make much sense... ...but it's hard for people to make sense when they're in love. We turn in here. - Oh. Oh. - Lory, you hurt? No, I'm fine. Let's see if you still got an automobile. Hey, Pete, come over and take a look at this car. Sure thing, Mr. McCall. - Sure you're all right? - I'm fine. - Get out. Take it easy. - Sorry, it's silly of me. What should I do, make a tunnel under the fence? It'll take a few minutes to check the car over. - I'm all right. - Let's go get a drink. Put this car in my stall when you get through tinkering. Sure thing, Mr. McCall. - This isn't yours? - Why not? This looks like a yacht. I'm glad you didn't say "trailer." Bottoms up. - Still a little shaky? - No, I'm fine now. You'd better sit down. No, the good seats are up front. Sit down. All passengers, please fasten your seat belts. Remember, no smoking during takeoff. What are you talking about? We're not going anywhere. Oh, but we are. - N-36B-- - Where are we going? I can't hear you. N-36B to tower, please. Requesting taxi instructions. Sit down, fasten your seat belt. Thank you. Well, what's this supposed to be, Shangri-la? No, this is the Arroyo Valley. One of the many mysterious holdings of Cash McCall. And the only place that I can talk to you whether you want to listen or not. Charming thought. Lory, I'd like to tell you a story. It's about a girl. And I'd like you to listen carefully and visualize it as though you were the girl. Last summer, I went up to Maine to spend a weekend with some friends. And I guess I'm not the party type. Anyway, the smoke and the drunken talk began to get on my nerves... ...and so I wandered out toward the lake. Suddenly, as if my mood itself had dreamed it up... ...there was a young girl in a white dress walking beside the lake. I just stood there staring. She was beautiful. She looked familiar somehow... ...even though I knew I'd never seen her before. I said to myself, she must be someone from the party inside, and I said to her: "I've been waiting for you. Would you like to dance?" We went into the party and I was very proper and correct. I didn't hold her too close. Not at first. We found a quiet corner of the house and sat there... ...taking turns trying to talk and breaking off... ...and just looking at each other. After a while, the party began to overflow into the corner... ... where we were and we got separated somehow. I found myself feeling very lonely. I sneaked out and I went back to my cabin. A rainstorm blew up so I made a fire... ...and stood looking at the fire and listening to the storm. I kept saying to myself, "Go to bed. Go to sleep. Forget about it." But I couldn't. I couldn't get that girl out of my mind. Suddenly, the door of the cabin opened... ...and there she stood, drenched to the skin. I still don't know which of us moved toward the other. I persuaded her to take some brandy... ...and I went to get something warm to put around her. It's supposed to be simple, being a bachelor. You meet a girl on a weekend and the two of you play at love. And on Monday morning, she gets on a train and you get on yours. But this wasn't one of those encounters. This girl wasn't a casual pickup whom you could drop that easily. This was very serious, and that made it frightening. When I came back with a robe, I could only stand and stare. This was getting completely out of control. I gave myself a lot of noble reasons, but not the real one. Actually, I was afraid of the way I really felt. I was too busy to fall in love. There were too many other important things. I knew I had to get her out of there, and I said, "You'd better go home, kid. You're too young to be out this late." She looked at me as if I had struck her... ...and I said it again before I could change my mind. "Go home." She turned and ran out. I stood in the doorway with my stomach tied in one big knot... ...and watched her running into the woods. I was so embarrassed, crying every step of the way. I just wanted to run away and.... Yeah, I know. Well, it isn't every day that a woman falls in love with someone. And then suddenly... ...she's made to feel cheap. It isn't every day a man discovers that he's still a child. When you run away from something you spent your whole life looking for, you.... Why don't we walk or something? You know the girl we were talking about? You could forget that she was you. It'd be a lot more exciting if you'd remember. - You didn't. - Oh, I remembered. I looked for you and I found you. It was on Labor Day, you were at a dance. You were dancing with a very nice-looking guy with a crew cut. And you? I was standing out on the terrace, watching. That's a very pretty house over there. I wonder who owns it. I do. - Bought it? - Built it. Where did you get my painting? I bought it from the publisher you work for. Why? Sentimental, I guess. I love you, Lory. Let's take a look at the house you built. Oh, Mr. Clark. Mr. McCall came in about five minutes ago. He's expecting you. Thank you. Gilmore, come in, come in. Hey, what do you got there, goodies? No, just tell me. Did you and Austen ever discuss patents? We never discussed much of anything. I've discovered a prize in the package that neither you nor Austen knew existed. What are you talking about? Years ago, Austen set up a routine. He probably forgot about it afterwards. Every design he worked out was automatically sent to Washington. Look. Every single one of those patents is assigned to Austen Plastics. Us. Nobody can use that equipment unless we say so. What time did you call Danvers and tell him we were washing out his business? About quarter to 10 this morning. Mm-hm. He's been trying to get me on the phone every half hour since 10:00. That's why he was in such a lather. Austen didn't remember that he owned those patents, but General Danvers did. And General Danvers can't operate without them. That's the house phone. Five will get you 10, Gil. McCall. Oh, he is, is he? Well, send him right up. Ah. Major General Andrew D. Danvers, U.S. Army, retired. - You're not gonna see him? - I'm gonna see the whites of his eyes. Cash, you haven't signed the deal with Austen yet. Well, we shook hands on it, that's good enough for me. You just let me handle Danvers alone. - Cash, I don't want-- - Go downstairs-- - Use the private-- Stay in the bedroom. - Without a signed contract-- I want you to know that I consider you unscrupulous, unethical and dishonest. - Come in, General Danvers. - I consider you a pirate and a blackguard. I'm well aware of how you feel about me... ...and I just can't find it in my heart to blame you. In your what? - I don't have any affection for you either. - Is that why you're out to ruin me? Is that why you're out to destroy the Schofield Instrument Corporation? Nobody has to ruin you or your company, general. Not as long as you're around to save them the trouble. You've managed to get your hands on a company... ...that I've supported for years, 60 percent of its product. And the minute you've got it, you refuse to supply me with molding parts. What are you up to, McCall, extortion? I hope you won't mind my saying it... ...but for a military man, you don't have either a logical mind... ...or a very good memory. You do have one very good military talent, though. You're very good at passing the buck. - What's that supposed to mean? - This isn't the first time it's happened. About a year ago, I sold you a cabinet factory... ...Padua Furniture Company. It's a first-rate shop. You got it at a good price. Now, if I remember correctly... ...you thanked me warmly for letting you have it. Indeed I did. I don't always recognize a thief the first time I see him. But when you found out... ...you had been offered the shop before at half the price... ...you started shooting off your mouth about how you'd been robbed. You're damn right I did. You didn't recognize that a year before... ...it wasn't worth half the price you paid for it. Now you're starting it all over again. You know the cost and trouble it's going to be... ...moving those molds from the Austen plant to Heckendorf's presses. Please, general, that's not what we're talking about. Your cost and trouble is going to be spent... ...in working out new presses and new molds... ...because all the old ones are covered by patents which I own. And if you try any of that hanky-panky with me, I'll beat your brains out. You think you've got me outflanked, don't you? If I didn't, you wouldn't be here. Now that I've covered one flank, let's cover the other. Namely, the Heckendorf Molding Company. If there aren't half a dozen letters in our files from a company like Heckendorf... ...asking for the use of our patents... ...I'd be very disappointed. In Heckendorf, that is. And just where is that supposed to leave me? Up the well-known creek, general, without a paddle. Because if we stop supplying you with parts, you're out of business. I've heard about "dog eat dog" before... ...but I never imagined even you could be this vindictive. I can't. Now, I'm willing to keep supplying you with parts from Austen Plastics. What? At a 10 percent increase across the board. - Oh, that's robbery. - No, I don't think so. If Heckendorf wanted the business, which he doesn't... ...he'd be charging you at least 25 percent. Now, as I see it, you have a very wide choice there, general. You can either take my generous offer or go home and cut your throat. No. No, sir, I won't do it. You won't? I refuse to jeopardize the Schofield Instrument Corporation... ...a fine company, a great company... ...by letting its sources of supply get into the hands... ...of a cheap, unscrupulous operator such as you are. Well, it's none of my business, of course, but what do you propose to do instead? I propose to get those lines of supply into Schofield hands. I want to buy the Austen Plastics Company. Buy it with what? With 300,000 shares of Schofield stock. Three hundred thousand shares? That's 3 million dollars. A cool million-dollar profit. Don't spend it all in one place. Schofield common is selling at $10 a share. No, it isn't. It's just lying there at $10 a share. Nobody's been buying Schofield since they missed their last two dividends. But, you know, Gil, this is getting to be intriguing. If I could manage to get control of the company-- Control of Schofield Instrument? Well, why not? I've got a hundred thousand shares that Schofield paid me for Padua Furniture. There's 300,000 that Danvers is offering for Austen Plastics. I'm sure I can get another hundred thousand shares through Will Atherson. That's a half a million shares. I wonder how much I'd need to get control. Cash... ...this whole thing could blow up right in your face. Yeah, that's true. If I tried to get control and I didn't get it. I'd have all my money tied up in Schofield stock and no way to get out from under. That's not what I'm thinking about. I'm thinking about the Austen deal. When I was working for Corporation Associates, your own company... ...Austen himself could have sold out to Danvers. Yeah, but for stock. He didn't want stock. He wanted cash. He told me himself. No, Gil, I think in 18 months, we can put this operation back in the black. You know, one decent dividend from Schofield... ...will put their stock up to $15. Gil, get out of here, I've got some thinking to do. - Look, Cash-- - I'll give you a call. Lockwood Company. Mr. Lockwood, please. Cash McCall. - Hello? - George? McCall. I got a rush job for you. Get a list of all the major stockholders in Schofield Instrument. See what you got in the files on each of them. Thanks, George. - Well, hello. - Heh. Hello. You're the one who's been doing these impressive flower arrangements. - Mm-hm. - I somehow didn't think it was Andrew. There's nothing like a woman's touch. It's thoughtful of you to take the time to do it yourself. Oh, I'm grateful for the diversion, Mr. McCall. Being a sort of glorified bookkeeper... ...I sometimes find it hard to remember that I'm a woman. I doubt that anyone around you would have that trouble. - May I? - Oh, yes, of course. As one bookkeeper to another... ...you should be doing things like that in a home of your own. Oh, very few women could find a home as beautiful as this. Is this the sort of surroundings a woman could be happy in? - With you? - Naturally. What I mean is, you don't think a woman would find this place too masculine? Well, I couldn't tell without knowing the woman. I'm afraid I don't know her too well myself. Let's just say our opportunities have been limited. But I plan to remedy that. You've brightened my whole day. Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Well.... Uh-huh. Everything certainly seems to be in order here. Just a moment, sir. You're sure you're absolutely satisfied? I couldn't be more so. No regrets? No reservations? It's not too late to change your mind. Why do you say that now? Is there anything wrong? Oh, it's just a little superstition of mine. Always give a man or a woman one last chance to say no. Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Well, I've had mine. Now let's sign the papers. I can't really tell you how delighted I am... ...and how very much... ...I appreciate the thoughtful way this whole thing has been handled. There we are. Mr. McCall, it's a pleasure to do business with you. Well, sir, I imagine you're looking forward to a long vacation. Oh, by the way, when is this plastics convention of yours? I thought we might catch a train down tomorrow morning. Oh, nonsense. We made a date. I'm supposed to fly you down. - That's an awful lot of trouble, isn't it? - Not at all. Let's say I pick you up here, 9:00 in the morning? Nine o'clock in-- Sure. Oh, maybe Lory would like to go down with us just for the ride? Oh, she'd be delighted. In the meantime, I could show you the wild nightlife of Philadelphia. How exciting. Goodbye. Mother, bye-bye. Have a good time, darling. - Good morning. - Yes, indeed. What do you know about the Margaret Schofield Foundation? - Not a thing. - You know what this is? This is a Lockwood report of the Schofield stockholders. "The Margaret Schofield Foundation is a medical research institution. It was established by the late Andrew Schofield... ...founder of the Schofield Instrument Corporation... ...and named in memory of his mother." Well, that's very interesting. You have no idea how interesting it is. When old man Schofield died... ...he left all his personal holdings to the Margaret Schofield Foundation. And now it becomes even more interesting, doesn't it? Yes, it does. If we could get this foundation behind us... ...if we had their proxy, plus the stock we already have or can get... ...then we'd have control of Schofield Instrument Corporation. Why should the foundation give us its proxy? The only money the foundation has... ....is what it gets in dividends from the Schofield stock. Now, you tell me, what's the catch there? Schofield Instrument hasn't declared a dividend lately. The head of the foundation is a Dr. Martin Bergmann. How do we get to Bergmann? Now, wait a minute. If he is in the Danvers camp, the minute we talk to him... ...word would get back to Danvers that we're trying to get control. Right. Now, we have two questions, Gil. How does Bergmann feel about Danvers? And how does he feel about Cash McCall? Why should he feel any way at all? Lockwood will have a report about Bergmann on your desk at 10:00. Get all the background you can on Bergmann. - Then go out and have a talk with him. - Me? You're the logical person. You're the head of Austen Plastics. If I muff this deal, you have 2 or 3 million dollars at stake. Don't think about money. Think about other things, like if you muff the deal... ...well, we can both sell apples on Independence Square. Wait a minute. What if I have to get in touch with you? Well, you can't. I'm taking the day off. I can't tell you how grateful we are. It's been a wonderful trip. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Well, ha-ha, thanks for the ride and all the rest of it. - Bye, honey. - Bye, Dad. Bye, Mother. Behave yourselves. - Bye. - Have a good time. - Come on, let's eat. - Eat? Where? A little place I know in Philadelphia called Cash McCall's. Oh. He's a charming man. He certainly is. He's done all right by us, hasn't he? I made a point of sitting up front with him on the flight. Just to let him know what a wonderful girl Lory is. Let's not worry about that, honey. Let them work it out. Oh, just thinking of Lory's future. You could do worse than have Cash McCall for a son-in-law. Yes, yes. Uh.... We're down here on a vacation. Come on. Come on, honey. Here's something interesting. "There's an open house every year at the Margaret Schofield Foundation... ...and General Danvers is usually on the program for a talk." That's interesting? This year, he wasn't even on the guest list. Thin but encouraging. There's another thing I can't quite analyze. The Lockwood boys phoned to say that Dr. Bergmann had a call this morning... ...from General Danvers that lasted 20 minutes. It could be he's anxious about getting the foundation's vote to buy Austen Plastics. After the talk, Dr. Bergmann got into his little car and got himself completely lost. - Yes? - Dr. Bergmann is here. He's here? Outside? Show him right in. Dr. Bergmann, I'm Gilmore Clark. And this is our counsel, Mr. Winston Conway. - How do you do? - Yes, I've heard of Mr. Conway. Oh, won't you sit down, doctor? I'm not really sure that you are the right man, Mr. Clark. But this we'll soon find out. I tried all morning to find this Mr. McCall. At his hotel, they wouldn't put me through on the telephone. Well, perhaps I can be of help to you, doctor. I'm given to understand that the Austen Plastics Company... ...actually belongs to Mr. McCall. That is true, is it not? That's correct, doctor. If Mr. McCall is given 300,000 shares of Schofield stock... ...will that mean he will take an interest... ...in the management of the Schofield Company? What do you mean, Dr. Bergmann? Oh, I don't know what I mean. All I know is that without Schofield dividends, the foundation dies. We can do great things, Mr. Conway. We have some brilliant, brilliant men. They need what the foundation can offer them. Freedom of work, equipment, facilities, individual financial support... ...to keep body and soul together. I ask nothing for myself. I cannot let the foundation die. Of course not, doctor. When can I talk to Mr. McCall? Well, probably sometime this evening. Not before that? Ah. I promised General Danvers I will give him word by 5:00. If I could talk to Mr. McCall before that. You know, Lory... ...no man should ask a woman to marry him unless.... Well, unless there's a reasonable chance he can give her solidity and security... ...the type of thing she has a right to want. But, well, it's just something I can never offer. I'm.... I'm broke one day and I'm rich the next. I always have been, I always will be. It's-- Well, I've tried to change, but it just doesn't work out. Aww. You can see what it would be. An offbeat life with an offbeat type of character. And that's not what you want. You're getting to be an expert on what I want? Well, my father was a great company man. He built up a wallpaper factory. He spent his whole life doing it so I could take over when he was through. And I couldn't. I get a wallop out of... ...taking a shaky company and bracing it up. Taking it apart and see that it runs again. But then, after about six months, well, all the fun's gone out of it. I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't belong. I'm just not a company man. Hello. Yeah, Gil. Bergmann? He did, huh? He does? Well-- Well, of course I wanna see him, but-- Why not? Do I have to see him? Can I see him tomorrow? I'm in the middle of a very important conference. Oh, don't mind me. Where are you, Gil? You sure you don't mind? Yeah, Gil, 20 minutes in Conway's office. You know, I know it's very rude, but this is something vital. It's very important. Yes, I can see that in your face. You know, it's amazing. Everything is falling right into place. Keep your fingers crossed. I think we're putting together one of the greatest companies of modern time. - You know what you look like right now? - No. You look the way my father used to look when he just worked out a new invention. - I do, huh? - Mm-hm. This somehow feels like a festive occasion. Did I tell you that I make an excellent martini? Oh, I make a better one. - You do, huh? - Mm-hm. When do you plan to start all of this feverish activity? As soon as I've had my drink. But first, I'm gonna sell the Austen Plastics Company. Oh, well, that's quick. - Who's the new owner going to be? - Me, if I'm lucky. Uh-- Would you mind flashing that on the board again? Well, it's a long, complicated story. Actually, it's a whole new way of life. I knew there was something I meant to ask you. Would you marry me? That's a pretty iffy question. All right, then, will you marry me? What brought that on? The raw hamburger? Love brought that on. A blinding flash of it all of a sudden? What happened to all that talk about security and solidity... ...and rich one day and poor the next? What shot that out from under you? You wanna stand around and argue all day or do you wanna get engaged? All it takes is a simple yes or no. Well, all right, if you wanna be snappish about it, yes. I thought you were mixing a drink. I'm drunk without one. You're supposed to be meeting those people. - Oh, yes, those people. - Yes. Oh. Here. All right. Go. - You do make an excellent martini. - Thank you. Promise me you'll be here when I get back? I promise. Oh, promise me one more thing. Anything. You'll clean up the kitchen? Oh, you, go on. Don't shove. - Well, I'm off to the bank. - We'll try to make out while you're gone. Joe, I had no idea Mr. McCall was in. Oh, yes, he got in around 1:00. Well, I haven't looked at the lunch orders yet. Maybe they weren't hungry. They? He and that cute little number he brought in with him. She's still up there. Well, back so soon? No, why would...? Would you mind going to the bank for me? I have a frightful headache. Oh. I thought Cash was here. - Mr. McCall. - General Danvers, I was gonna call you. - McCall, there's something-- - Shall we sit down? But, McCall, just-- I've been wanting to talk to you, sir. - Now, McCall-- - Sit down, sir. McCall, something's going on and I don't like the smell of it. I've been trying to get ahold of one of my directors, Dr. Bergmann. I learned from his office that he was with you. - That's right, I just left him. - I wanna know what you're up to. Well, the deal is set. Bergmann's all for it. What? I'm glad you're not the type who can back out of a commitment. - It's gonna be nice working with you. - What are you talking about? - You're not gonna be working with me. - I'm afraid I am, general. I've lined up Dr. Bergmann's vote. As of 15 minutes ago, I control Schofield Instrument Corporation. You.... Uh.... That's not possible. You're not gonna get away with this. If you think you can take my company, sell it for scrap-- I have no plans for scrapping or selling anything, general. I'm just tired of fighting you. You're too much soldier for me. You haven't really seen me in action yet, McCall. Here's something I want you to think about. I'd like you to appoint Gil Clark president of Schofield. Indeed. And what happens to the old president, me? I'd like us to kick you upstairs, chairman of the board. If you're playing games, McCall, so help me-- I'm playing big games, general. I'm changing my whole style. And I need a commander upstairs, not a chief of staff. First, we forget television. We forget all thought of mass merchandising... ...and consumer products. We're already sitting on the hottest thing, electronics. So we concentrate on electronics. Question. Where is the big money in that field today? Why, military sale. That's where you're gonna be the biggest help for the next years. You've got the contacts in Washington. You've got salesmanship. You're gonna be spending time there, peddling the merchandise. Sooner or later, that market is gonna play out. We'll have our research and development worked out to a degree... - ...and we'll be off and running. - Oh.... Oh, you all right? I-- I-- I-- I'm just a little bit dizzy. Where do I fit into this long-range picture? I almost hesitate to tell you, general. You're gonna be scooting around... ...flipping switches, riding the panic button... ...and longing for the peace and quiet of World War II. Well, what do you think? I think you're out of your mind. Hell, I think we both are. It's not a bad feeling, is it? You sleep on it, general. I'll call you in the morning. You can let me off at the penthouse, young man. I'll fly the rest of the way. Hey, Lory. Lory. Hello. Hello. What happened to Miss Austen? Miss Austen? Well, there wasn't anybody here when I came in. That's strange. It's also strange coming in and finding you here. Oh, I wanted to see that you were comfortable. There's something I've been wanting to suggest to you, Mrs. Kennard. When you wanna check on my comfort, you don't need a Lockwood report. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about women who are so smart they're stupid. I've seen your letter to Lockwood and his letter to you. Mrs. Kennard, I own the Lockwood reports. You own a lot of things. And I do not own the hotel. If I did, you'd be downstairs now, cleaning out your desk... ...and wondering where your next job was coming from. Mr. Atherson might arrange that anyway. Mr. Atherson? Yes, he owns the hotel. You tell me what you said to Miss Austen... ...that caused her to leave in such a hurry. You're such a big shot, aren't you? You're so clever. Well, you're not. You're just as big a fool as every other man I've ever seen. A woman with brains isn't enough for you. - A woman who could mean something. - Like who? What was all that double talk about the woman's touch... ...about how I could be so happy in these surroundings? Why did you lead me on? If you think every man who says "good morning" is making a pass at you... ...you've led a very sheltered life. When I wanna lead someone on, I go looking for a woman... ...not a calculating machine with a hat on. I know what you go looking for. You're just like my hus-- My ex-husband. You want somebody like that cheap little high school tramp I caught him with. Somebody who could soften his head and flatter his vanity. Well, I straightened her out about men. And I straightened out your dear little Miss Austen. I want you to get out of here quietly and quickly. If you so much as see me walking through the lobby downstairs... ...you'd better duck out of sight. Get out. Mrs. Kennard, not that way. You keep trying, will you, operator? I'll be up in my room if anybody calls. Yes, thank you. I think it's gone up 10 whole points. That's a rise of about two and a half points in the past three weeks. Grant Austen, where are you sneaking off to? - I'll see you later, Walt. - See you later. - Oh, hi. - Harv Bennett. - Yes, Harv, I know. Sure, sure. - Ha-ha-ha. - Weren't trying to avoid me, were you? - No. After all, there's nothing personal about this, you know. Ha-ha-ha. Where's Miriam? Don't tell me she let you come here without her. Oh, no, no, she's here. She was tired, gone up to the room. What you're trying to say is she got tired of all this talk about the plastic business. - Yes, yes. Ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha. - That's right. - Yeah, Grant, you old horse thief, you. I swear I didn't know you had it in you. Boy, you really put old Danvers over the barrel, didn't you? Ha-ha-ha. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Tell me all about it. Now, you don't have to be cagey with me. Not anymore, you don't. Don't forget I'm on the board of Schofield Instrument. Danvers had me on the phone about this. He had to have my vote. Had to have your vote for what? Why, to give you those 300,000 shares of stock for your company. I'm afraid somebody's got things confused. I'm not selling out to Schofield Instrument. I've already sold the company to somebody else. You couldn't sell to somebody else if you wanted to... ...not after you gave an option to General Danvers. I never gave Danvers any option to buy my company. I never even talked to Danvers about selling out Schofield Instrument. Well, then, why would he say you had given him an option to buy? I don't know, I don't know. I suppose he thought he had me in a spot where I'd have to sell to him. Well, sir, I've got $2 million in the bank says he figured wrong. Ha-ha-ha. Two million...? Yes, sir. Grant, just who did you sell to? Mr. McCall. Not Cash McCall. Yes, yes, why? Is the deal closed? The deal is closed. What's wrong? Well, I'll give it to you in plain English. You say McCall gave you $2 million for your company. Two million dollars. It was a good deal. Oh, yeah? Who said it was? I said it was. My business consultants, Corporation Associates... ...never thought I'd get much. Neither did my own banker, Will Atherson. Your own...? Boy, Grant, they really saw you coming. Ha-ha-ha. I'll tell you who it was a good price for. Cash McCall, that's who. Why, this is the Padua Furniture Company all over again, except it's bigger. Look, McCall takes your company off your hands for $2 million. He turns around and, the very next day, sells it to Schofield Instrument... ...for 300,000 shares of Schofield stock. Do you know how much that stock's worth at the market price? Three million dollars. - Three million dollars-- - Did you have a lawyer helping you? Mr. Conway, yes. Winston Conway, McCall's lawyer. You used a management firm that McCall owns... ...and a banker McCall carries around in his hip pocket. Oh, Harv, I'm sure you're exaggerating-- I don't have to exaggerate where McCall's concerned. Why, for all you know, he could have your own family working against you. - Heh. Good night, Grant. - Yes, good night. And try not to get lost on your way upstairs, huh? - Operator. - Yes. Operator, this is Mr. Austen. Yes. Will you get me the Hotel Ivanhoe in Philadelphia right away, please? - It did? Ha-ha-ha. - Yes, I'll hold on right here. Yes. I'll see you soon, goodbye. Desk. All right, put him on. Oh, hello. This is Mr. Austen. Grant Austen, yes. Will you ring Cash McCall's suite? Oh, I'm sorry, this is an outside line. You'll have to phone Mr. McCall direct. Well, I don't have that number down here, no. Give me the manager, please. No, our manager stepped out for a moment. Our assistant manager is in. If you'll hold the line for a moment, I'll connect you. Yes? Mrs. Kennard? Oh, Mrs. Kennard, there's a Mr. Austen on the line. He wants to get through to Mr. McCall, but I told him it was impossible. He's very insistent. It's something about Mr. McCall and his daughter. Austen? Oh. Ahh.... Uh.... Yeah, yes, put him on. Oh, hello, this is Mr. Austen. How, are you Mr. Austen? Oh, I'm sorry to have bothered you, Mrs. Kennard, but I'm a little worried. My daughter flew back from Moon Beach with Mr. McCall... ...and we haven't heard from her. And, uh, heh, I'm-- I worry about airplanes, yes. I was wondering if she's all right. Well, I suppose it's a matter of opinion as to whether she's all right or not. Oh, now, there hasn't been any plane crash, if that's what you mean. No, it was about, uh.... Uh.... Oh, I'd say it was about 1:15 that they went up to his suite. One-fifteen this afternoon? Oh, yes. Oh, I wouldn't worry. She's in and out of there all the time. Oh! Ha-ha-ha. Thanks, Pop. - Come on, honey. - Thank you. Thank you. - Penthouse, Mr. McCall. - Thank you. You're a cheery little group. You all look like Santa Claus was dead. It might very well be the case. You certainly picked a lovely time to disappear. What is all this? You'd better take this sitting down, Cash. I was dragged out of bed this morning by a phone call from a lawyer... ...who's been retained by Grant Austen. Austen wants to start legal action against you and all the rest of us. For what? Fraud, deceit, breach of confidential relationship. Mr. Austen feels that everyone connected with your buying his company... ...has conspired to cheat him of $1 million. Most ridiculous thing I ever heard. It's not as ridiculous as you think. Want to hear a run-through? Yeah, I certainly do. The plaintiff, Grant Austen, is a conservative, successful businessman... ...honest and respected. Until recently, he was president... ...of the Austen Plastics Company of Suffolk, Pennsylvania. To advise him in the management of his business... ...he retained a man named Gilmore Clark, an employee of Corporation Associates... ...a firm believed to be headed by Harrison Glenn... ...but actually owned and controlled by Mr. Cash McCall... ...a fact which we shall find significant. Austen knew I owned it. I told him so myself. On Tuesday of last week, Mr. Austen was approached by Clark... ...who advised him he would be smart to sell the Austen Plastics Company. - That's not true. - And this is what Mr. Clark said to him: "You might get as much as $2 million, if you find the right buyer." Seeking advice, Mr. Austen went to an old and trusted friend, Mr. Atherson... ...president of the Freeholders Bank and Trust Company of Philadelphia. Mr. Austen rightly felt the logical buyer for his plant... ...was the Schofield Instrument Corporation. However, Atherson advised him not to approach the Schofield people... ...that they could not pay Mr. Austen $2 million for his plant. Now, Mr. Clark had said he had a buyer. Atherson had a buyer too. And it developed that both these prospective buyers... ...were none other than Mr. Cash McCall. Pure coincidence. Well, let us review another strange and wonderful coincidence. Now, Mr. Austen was dissuaded from offering his firm to anyone... ...but Mr. McCall. And then it developed that the Schofield Instrument Corporation... ...could and would buy Austen Plastics from Mr. McCall... ...for $3 million worth of Schofield stock. Austen didn't want stock and he couldn't have got $3 million... ...from Schofield or anybody else. Well, that's something Mr. Austen never had a chance to find out. Thanks to his own business consultant and his own banker... ...men who were supposed to be working for him... ...but who were actually hatchet men for Cash McCall. This is getting ridiculous. It's not going to sound ridiculous... ...when their lawyers say it in court. The further we dig into this, gentlemen, the more insidious it becomes. The trustworthy banker who arranges a million-dollar loan for Mr. McCall. The fortuitous meetings between Mr. McCall and General Danvers... ...of Schofield Instrument Corporation. Danvers? Last year, Mr. McCall paid $600,000 for the Padua Furniture Company. He turned around and sold it to Schofield for $1 million worth of stock. And now he has sold a plastics company worth $2 million to the same firm... ...for $3 million. Now, it could be merely that General Danvers... ...is a surprisingly generous man where Mr. McCall is concerned. Or that Mr. McCall has bought the general off. Mr. McCall, yesterday afternoon... ...you made a proposal to certain business associates... ...concerning General Danvers. Something about appointing Danvers chairman of the board of Schofield. What sort of salary would the general draw as chairman? Probably a hundred thousand dollars a year. Gentlemen, the plaintiff rests. Well, we have a lawyer on our side too. If you mean me, don't count on it. Austen is threatening to have me disbarred for the advice I gave him. Well, what would you gentlemen have me do? Give the company back to Austen? Let him have the Schofield deal himself? Well, under the circumstances, it might be the wisest thing to do. When I'm in the right? I'm not guilty on a single count. Atherson's right. You have to be realistic. There's nothing to be gained by fighting it. And there are reputations involved. Mine, Will's, Conway's. You can leave me off that list because I don't like being realistic. I'd rather feel good than look good any day in the week. Steady, boy. I've been in on this from the start. I know what's going on. I know the plans McCall had for Austen's future. Nobody could've been more generous than McCall. And nobody could've been more pleased about it than Grant Austen. He had his cake. Now he wants everybody else's. Well, I wouldn't give it to him just because he starts crying. I suppose this had to happen sometime, Cash. You've always had your fingers in too many pies. You never seemed to mind, Glenn. Not as long as you were getting your share of the plums. You gentlemen are very generous with advice... ...but it comes a little late. You might as well think it over, Cash. You gain nothing by being stubborn, you know. You're a little upset now. Maybe I'm too pessimistic. I hope. You're waiting for the mud in the face, Gil? You're a little stupid, Gil. I must say I like it. I kind of like it myself. Well, what do we do? I've got personal problems. As soon as I straighten those out, I'll go down to Moon Beach... ...and see what I can do with Austen. Good luck, Cash. - Yeah? - Cash? - George Lockwood speaking. - Yeah, George? Austen just left his lawyer's office and is on his way home. Okay, George. Thanks. I don't care if it costs me this million and another million besides. I am going to nail those crooks. Every last one of them. Hmm? You're damn right I'll be here all day. All right, all right, you go ahead and do just that. Goodbye. Lory, why didn't you answer the phone? Hmm? I kept calling and calling, and calling and calling. Honestly, your mother and I were so disturbed and so worried. You know, and this Mr. McCall-- Dad, this Mr. McCall is the man I met in Maine last summer. - McCall is the man that you-- - That's right. You let him get his hands-- Dad, it isn't like that at all. - I'll get rid of that-- - I'll get it, I'll get it. Well, hello. I've looked all over everywhere for you. You promised me you'd wait. Well, let's just say your apartment became a little crowded. What are you talking about? She didn't climb in through the window. She had her own key. Is that what all this fuss is about? Well, it just so happens that the lady-- It just so happens that I'm not interested in hearing any more explanations. Well, I am. You've got a lot of nerve showing your face here. Grant, remember, hives. Please don't get excited. Why the hell shouldn't I get excited? I can't stand to look at him. I know why you can't stand to look at me. I don't see how any of you can look anybody in the face. You're throwing wild accusations-- Wild accusations. How could you possibly, after what you've done--? I am sick and tired of the whole thing. - High-handed business. - High-handed? Who could be more high-handed than you? I would like to know. You and that sanctimonious pack of thieves that you run around with. The whole lot of you. No principles, no decency. You aren't talking about principles. - Stop shouting. - Your big concern is money. - Money? You wanna talk about--? - Stop shouting, Dad, now, please. You wanna talk about money? Let's talk about money, Mr. McCall. All right, let's. First of all, I should tell you I just came from a meeting... ...with those sanctimonious thieves. They advised me to wash out the whole deal... ...and give the Austen Plastics Company back to you. They did? Not because they'd done anything wrong. Because they can't afford to be crucified in the newspapers. You think I bought your company for $2 million... ...knowing it was worth three million? Well, actually, I figured it was worth about a million and a half. That's a likely story. I didn't want that rundown molding plant of yours. - The country is full of plastics factories. - Well, why'd you buy it? I wanted a line of communication with your daughter... ...whom I'm in love with and had me on her drop-dead list. I guess you thought you were doing pretty good there for a while. I thought I was. Yesterday, I asked her to marry me and she accepted. Didn't know then how easily an Austen commitment could be broken. We're not talking about me or my daughter, Mr. McCall. We're talking about you. You and your underhanded methods... ...and the spies that you had on my company. - Spies? - Spies, yes. Corporation Associates. Wait a minute, Dad, what are you talking about, spies? You told him about Corporation Associates... ...the day Dad and I went to your apartment. What am I supposed to do, come in and call him a liar? Well, it doesn't matter whose father he is. He's calling you a crook. Do you have to be polite and agree? Do you have to back down without a fight? Honey, you just stay out of this now. No, but, Dad, I remember that. I was there and I remember what was said and what wasn't said. All these terrible things that he's accusing you of doing... ...you didn't do them, did you? You didn't do any of them. Well, that's beside the point. When it hits the paper, I'm the villain and your father's the underdog. What's the difference? It's the difference between right and wrong. That's what it is. What do I lose, a little money? I've been broke before. You've been broke all your life, whether you had money or not. Up until yesterday afternoon, you had nothing. And now you've got something that you've needed. And if you throw it away now, you'll never get it back. Lory. Lory, you're making with a lot of talk now and very little sense. Dad, you know, he thought he had himself all figured out. No talent, no aim in life. He thought that he could buy and sell things... ...but he couldn't make anything except money. And then all of a sudden, yesterday afternoon... ...he found out that wasn't true. Yesterday seems like a long time ago. I shouldn't care what happens to you, but I do. And I care about my father. I don't want you to do something that you're gonna feel sorry for, Dad. You can't give in to him on this. You're not just washing out deals here. You're ruining his life and mother's and mine. And you're washing out your own future. I'm not washing out anything. And I'm not giving in on anything either. I have a lot of respect for my money and even more respect for my friends. And I won't have either of them abused. What can you do? I'm going to fight you in your lawsuit and win. My friends will come out with some handsome scars... ...but there will be no dirt on them. Well, thinking only of your friends sounds pretty pious. Well, it's true that I do have $5 million tied up in it. But there are a lot of people depending on me. The same people that you didn't think about... ...when you took your $2 million and ran. The people who made up your business. The personnel at the factory. The town the factory supported. You never knew, you never once checked... ...under what sort of character you were selling it to. All you wanted to know was how much is in it for Grant Austen... ...after taxes. One day, a man's gonna walk up to the undertaker and ask: "How much do I save in taxes if I die now?" Well, you didn't worry about your people. - And now I've got them to worry about. - Hello? I also have the whole Schofield Instrument Corporation... ...and General Danvers and the stockholders... ...and the people from Dr. Bergmann's research foundation. I'm not gonna turn my back on them. - I'll tell you another thing-- - Grant? What is it, Mrs. Austen? Oh, I'm so sorry. Grant, it's a Mr. Parker. - Who? - Mr. Parker. - He said he's your lawyer. - Oh, oh. Excuse me. I'm pretty busy right now, Mr. Parker. Yes. Mm-hm. Oh, I'm not sure I'm suing anybody for anything. No, no. Mm-hm. Yes. Yes, I know I did. Yes. Now, now, now, Mr. Parker, now, just calm yourself. We'll talk about this later. Yes. Goodbye. Now go on. Go ahead. There just doesn't seem to be any place for me to go. No, no, no, there was one point that you passed over rather fast, Mr. McCall. Did you say that you have control of Schofield now? - That's right. - Mm-hm. Then you don't have to worry about losing the Schofield business? No. You know, that's a big relief to me. That weighed very heavily on my mind. I suspected it did. Yes, sir, I was evasive about that. See, I never told you and I never told Gil... ...that General Danvers had me over a barrel. He threatened to take away 60 percent of my business. It bothered me. It bothered me, because I never told you about it. It made me feel, you know, small inside as well as outside. And when you get like that, you, heh, wind up being angry at everybody. I think I know what you mean. I wasn't really mad about that Schofield deal... ...and about your quick million-dollar profit. That isn't really what troubled me. You know what really bothered me? - No. - I was jealous. Yes, sir, I was jealous of you. That's right. Because, well, you were doing the one unforgivable thing. You were busy. You know, you were working. You were functioning and poor old Grant Austen wasn't. You were working, all right. Without you, there wouldn't have been any million-dollar profit. Oh? What are these? That's poor old Grant Austen, functioning on all eight cylinders. My goodness, my patents. Heh. I hadn't given these a thought in years. Nobody else had except General Danvers. Danvers? He couldn't have done anything to me after all? - Hmm? - No. I had him over the barrel, didn't I? You sure did. You know, maybe I'm not as fuzzy-headed... ...as some people think I am, huh? Mr. McCall, I'm really very sorry for all this mess that I've caused. And if there's possibly anything which I could do to help you straighten it out-- Oh, I think you've taken care of that already, sir. I'm sorry to have taken up all your time. Is there anything you wanted to say? Any questions you want to ask? Well, I guess that about wraps it up. Mrs. Austen, Grant. Lory. Lory, don't let him go. He loves you. Come on, baby. Get out there. Don't let him get out of that door. Go on. - McCall. - Oh, yes? All right, who was she? Who was who? The blond with the feathers. - Feathers? - With the crazy hat. - With the key to your apartment. - Oh, that one. Well, she had a key to all the apartments. She was the assistant manager. - The assistant manager? - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell me that? - You didn't ask. You walk into the place, you make an assumption. - Something wrong? - Yes, yes. This McCall has proposed to me, and now he's trying to run out. That's an outright lie. I've tried every way to make an honest woman out of you. Now I know why he looks familiar. - He's the man in the pictures. - Yes. - In Lory's studio. - That's right. There's something I wanna explain to you, Miriam. Well, aren't you going to do something? - Oh, yes. - Psst! Psst! Psst! Gilmore. Listen.... - Where did you come from? - I came in the back way. Whatever you said to him, apologize. If you have to give another million, steal the money. - Gotta have the Austen plant. - What are you babbling about? I just had a call from Andy. Andy? General Danvers. He knows where we can get the chemical plant we need to round out the package. - We can get it for about a million dollars. - So? In eight months, Andy and I can have the whole thing running smoothly. We'll have an operation we can sell for $20 million. I can even tell you where. Is that all you and Andy ever think about? Buying and selling? We're not putting an organization like this together just to unload it. The only way you'll ever get anywhere... ...is to stay with it and build and build and build. Well, that's Cash McCall for you. Once a company man, always a company man. Excuse me, Gil. I couldn't help overhearing. Did you say something about a chemical plant? Yes, he did. Now, you go up there and build. Grant, I need two things. I need a good solid idea man to run Austen Plastics for me. I need somebody to invest a million dollars in a chemical plant. - I think you're just the man for both. - Sounds good, very interesting. - I'll tell you what the setup is. - Let's talk it over. You can have your old desk back or work in the plant. - I would like my old desk back. - We're not gonna bother you with details. Where are we going? I'm gonna make an honest woman out of you. Oh. I knew there was something I forgot.
