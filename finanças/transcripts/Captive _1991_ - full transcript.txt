I want to personally kill this bastard. >> Oh. Mr. and Mrs. Plunk, I'd like you to meet my associate, Special Agent Kinderson. >> Hello. Is there anything I can get for you? Mrs. Plunk, I'm going to have to take you and your daughter to the hospital for an examination. (baby crying) >> Come here. >> Mommy... >> What he did to my wife... (sighs) What they both did. It... I couldn't do a damn thing. I wanted to jump them. I kept looking for the right moment. (sighs) I promised Kathy that if either of them... laid a finger on her, I'd kill them. >> Listen to me, Mr. Plunk. Anything you might have tried against those two would have been fatal. It would have provoked more violence in them, and it would have killed you, and probably your wife and child too. >> I didn't even try. >> It sounds to me like you both handled the situation incredibly well. >> No, I didn't protect my wife and baby! Kathy's going to hate me for that. (approaching footsteps) (door closes) >> Am I pregnant? >> We'll know more in a few days. >> And what about... the other test? >> Frost and Knott will be tested for AIDS as soon as they're apprehended. To be safe, though, you should schedule your own periodic check-ups. Kathy, forensics will need your clothes for tests. >> Oh. They can keep them. It wasn't me doing all those things, it's... it's... it's all so disgusting. >> What do you think you've done that was so terrible? >> Well... the whole thing. What I did with... Jeff. I led him on. I let him... pretend we were Bonnie and Clyde. >> You keep calling him Jeff. You liked him. >> No. No. >> I'm not accusing you, Kathy. >> He was different from Knott. More... human, somehow. And at first, I... I wanted him to help us. And then, as... as weird as it sounds... I wanted to help him. It's crazy, it doesn't-- it doesn't make any sense. >> No, it makes perfect sense. You did exactly what you had to do. >> (scoffs) Yeah... But it's the other things I did. I let him like me. I mean, Jeff-- Frost didn't hold a gun to my head. I didn't... fight enough. >> You did everything that was necessary to survive. You must see that. These two men had the power of life and death over all of you. >> What will Paul think of me? >> Well, this is a welcome change. (grunts) (locks door) (sighs) How do you feel? >> More tired than I've ever felt in my life. >> Well, uh-- oh, there. I'll put Katie down, and then I'll get us organized here. Shh... You think the last few days will hurt her? >> The doctors say she'll be okay. She's young. Probably won't remember, heh. >> Hmm. >> We should be so lucky. Look, I'm too tired to think. Do you mind if I take a bath? >> No, of course not. (knock on door) (sighs) Uh, are you okay? You've been in here forever. >> I'll be out in a minute. >> Oh... well, let me get you a towel. >> Paul... I just need some space, okay? (door closes) >> (sighs) >> Jeff, no. >> Kathy, it's me. >> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (siren blaring) ♪♪ >> Oh, there's two of 'em now, man. What are we gonna do? >> If they try to stop us, we'll blow their heads off. Move it! >> I am! >> Take that vest. >> Here. >> Thanks. >> You're just in time, Jordan. We spotted them on highway 12. (tires screeching) >> I think they got a roadblock. (tires screeching) >> Run it! >> I can't! (tires screeching) (bird whooping) (gunshots) >> Hyuh! >> (gasping) (whimpering) >> You know, I've been thinking. I think after breakfast, we should get out of here. I'll call Rudy and Hilda, we'll tell them we're okay and we're on our way. (indistinct chatter) >> Ahem, morning. >> Ah... any news? >> It's all over. >> They're dead? >> One of them was killed in a shootout earlier this morning. >> Great. >> Which one? >> They had a couple of hostages with them, tried to make a run for it in a stolen tow truck. >> Who? >> Frost was killed at the scene. Knott was shot as well. We thought he was dead, but doctors seem to think he's gonna pull through. >> Well, you should have finished the job, damn it. (silverware clatters on plate) >> (crying) Excuse me. >> Kathy... >> Kathy! Kathy? >> (sobbing) As sick as he was, he was just a dumb kid! He was just a dumb kid, and I just kept telling him-- I told both of them that it didn't have to end like this. >> But that's exactly where their life was headed. You and your husband are lucky they didn't take you down with them. Jenny Blaker wasn't so lucky. She and a young man-- a tow truck driver-- were taken hostage last night. She died in the shootout this morning. >> Oh, no. >> She was 29 years old. >> No, no. >> Married with two small kids. >> (crying) No, no. (sobbing) Paul wants us to go back to Yachats today. Deborah, I don't know if I can ever go back there. He doesn't know what I've been through. I mean, he was there and-- and then... He thinks he knows, but he can't-- he can't really know. (sobbing) >> He knows more than you give him credit for. You need to be more understanding about what he's been through, what he's still going through. Just as you are of Jeff Frost. (birds chirping) (car door slams) >> Here they come. (imitating trumpet fanfare) >> Ah. >> Kathy! Welcome home, darling. >> Hey, Rudy. >> Hi, Paul. >> What's all this? >> Oh, it's so good to see you. Hello, Katie. >> Hi, Kathy. >> Hello, Paul. Oh, so good to have you back. >> Look at this, heh. It's beautiful. I-- I love flowers. >> It's not just from us. >> It's from the whole town, Kathy. Everybody wants to welcome you back home, and we hope-- >> We want you to stay. Is there anything I can do to help you? In any way? >> Would you come upstairs with me? >> (fussing) Mom... I can't live here. >> Honey, um... Yeah, we don't have to live here. Maybe we can rent a place nearby. (waves crashing) (seagulls calling) >> I'm going to go open the motel. (seagull squawking) (static on TV) >> (inhales and grunts) (rooster crowing) (muttering) >> I didn't hear you get up. >> I wanted to get an early start. I've got a lot to do today. >> Well, I thought maybe we could spend some time down near the water. Just the two of us. To talk. >> Maybe tomorrow. >> Paul, I really-- >> Not today. (door shuts) (waves crashing) (seagulls chattering) (drill whirring) >> What are you doing? >> Something I should have done when we first bought this place. >> Paul, we didn't move here to live like this. Have you lost your mind? >> Yes! It's not going to happen again, Kathy. And this will make sure that you're safe when I'm not here. >> Look, I agreed to give this a try, but this is not the way. >> Well... >> Paul, this isn't a zoo. Can we talk about this? >> It's not open for discussion, Kathy, and you're not going to be working alone till I'm finished here. >> Fine. (dishes clatter) Here's your lunch. (waves crashing) (seagulls chattering) (clatter) >> Hi, Katie. I don't know why you get so angry. I'm only trying to protect you! (cracks beer can) >> I refuse to live like this, Paul. This isn't what our dream was about, and I don't just mean those bars. >> Mm-hmm. >> There's no intimacy. (clattering) Forget intimacy. We can't even talk about the weather anymore. When you're not working yourself to exhaustion at the motel, you're-- stalking around here like-- like Rambo on guard duty. This isn't the man I fell in love with. >> I'm only trying to keep this family together. You know what your problem is? You're too trusting. >> You used to say that was something you liked about me. >> Yeah, well, that was before. >> Well, I don't care. I'd rather be that way than always suspicious, than-- than living like a-- a prisoner! That's it, isn't it? Those bars aren't to keep people out-- you're trying to keep me in. Why don't you just admit it? >> Why are you making this so hard for me? >> And I suppose you think you're making it easy on me! >> That's exactly what I'm trying to do! >> Well, I think we both need some help. >> No, I think we're doing just fine. >> No, we're not. >> Well, we will be if you'll just do what I say! >> Come back here and talk to me, damn it! We don't need to do this alone! ♪♪ (wood chopping) (sizzling) >> Just in time. (water running) >> Oh, good. (water shuts off) Where's Katie? >> I put her down early. She was tired from shopping in Newport this afternoon. >> What? Damn it, Kathy. I told you not to go into town alone! What if-- (sighs) We've talked about this. >> You talked. I listened. (water running) How was fishing? >> (sighs) >> Didn't work. I thought I could get away from things, and all I ended up doing was snapping at Rudy for no reason at all. (cracks a beer) Kathy, I've decided we shouldn't be in the motel business. >> But it's only been six weeks. >> I know. >> I thought we were going to give this a try. >> No, you're right. I'm suspicious of everyone who wants a room. I jump at my own shadow. My God, I don't think I'm ever going to be able to trust anyone again. >> Don't you know that I feel the same way? I'm scared all the time, I... I'm scared of everyone who comes into the motel. I'm scared to be alone here at night. >> Well, that's my point. What the hell are we doing here? (sighs) God, I wish I understood you. >> Paul, if we can't make a life for ourselves here, then where? >> They stole something from me, Kathy. They took a big piece of what it feels like to be a man. And I wish you could understand what that does to me. I can't live with the fear of letting this family down again. >> Oh, honey. You didn't let anybody down. You were incredibly brave. You walked through the snow, all of the-- This isn't about you, is it? (crying) It's about me. You can't talk to me, you can't even look at me because of what I did. >> I am in awe of what you did. You were-- you are-- the strongest person I have ever known. >> I am not so strong. >> Kathy, listen to me. It's not too late to start over. Please. Let's sell out. >> And go where? Paul, running won't do it. If we run, we've let those monsters ruin our lives. No... no... We should stay. (sniffles) And we should help each other. And forgive ourselves. >> That's the hard part.

You gotta be out of your mind! >> Look, Mr. Plunk, it's my job to check these things out. >> Yeah, well, it's my right to kick you off my property. >> Paul... >> So get the hell out of here and don't come back! Come on, get out of here! Get out of here! >> Paul... >> Come on, move it, move it! >> Paul! Paul, you have got to stop. You've got to stop attacking people. >> I'm not attacking anyone, Kathy. >> Well, what was that? >> That, I'm just doing what you're always after me to do. I was just telling somebody what I felt about them. >> Well, that guy-- >> "That guy"-- you know who that guy is? He's an investigator for Knott's lawyer. Get this, they want us to testify on Knott's behalf. They actually want us to say something nice about him at the trial! >> You're not serious. >> Oh, yes, I am serious.

No, listen, listen. "Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor, we offered Mr. Knott a job because we thought that he'd make a terrific night manager. (laughing) >> Right. >> (laughing) Yeah! We thought he'd be great with the guests! (both laughing) And that, deep down, he was just truly misunderstood. (both laughing) Oh, God... Oh, God, it's crazy.
