Female narrator : Even in his slumber, the dreams of the Winter King were controlling the wicked winter weather. Male narrator : Weather that threatened to bury the world of Ever After, forever after. Female narrator: The students of Ever After were forced to take shelter. Their only hope lay in the hands of the Snow Princess, Crystal Winter, and her friends struggling at the top of the world. - Hang on! Not much longer! - Yeah, not much longer till I'm sick! (Wind roars) (Screaming) Daring: Oh! All: Ah! (Recovery sigh) Is everybody okay? (Groans) - Don't worry, everyone! I'm fine. (Pained moans) - The winter palace. I'm home again. - Now all we have to do is get there. - Then stop Jackie Frost and her brother, Northwind. - And find the rose of winter! - Remove the curse from your parents. - Then save the world of Ever After from eternal winter! That's everything, right? So, what are we waiting for? - How about a ride? You'll never get to the palace on that. - Yes we will. We have to. Agh! I've got a powerful idea. Northwind: (Grunts) Snow King: (Snores) - Uh, Jackie, 'member how you said that Crystal would sleep for a hundred years, and we would never see her again? - Yes, Northwind. - Well, a hundred years goes by really fast. She's here, at the top of the world. Ahh! - I didn't think she had it in her. She's still an overprivileged princess. She can't actually do anything. (Chuckles) You know why? Because we got the palace, and who has the power? We've got the power. (Frightened gasps) We won! I rule! And if that pampered princess can actually make it to the palace, we'll deal with her then. - What exactly will we rule if the world gets destroyed by winter? - Grrr! - But you're so smart, I guess you got it all figured out. Cross-country skis! - Woo-hoo! - Yes! - A powerful plan, Princess! We'll fly across the snow! - Nice idea, but keep your skis. I'll just fly. - Could someone please help me with this knot? I promise, I almost have it! (Wings flutter) ♪♪♪ Come on! Ugh. - (Struggles) Uhhh! (Snoring) - Oh-oh! - (Yawns) (Staff skids) - Oh, yeah! I am awesome! - Nothing can stop us now! Woo-hoo! Ahhhh! Wha-ahhhh! No! Agh! Oof! - At last! The power of winter! - Well, you better use it quick to turn off the wicked weather down below. 'Cause if the world gets buried, who do we get to boss around? - Blizzard begone! Ahhh! (Magical whoosh) (Loud bang) (Screaming) (Wind gusts) - Whoa! You've just like doubled it! Snowflakes the size of houses! That was your plan, right? I'm confused. - (Unconvincing) Yeah, of course. I meant to do that. (Nervous chuckle) - You are so smart! This plan is so tricky, I can't tell how it would ever work at all! - Let me adjust a few settings and... whaaaa! (Magical whoosh) - Whoa! You are getting pretty good with that! Except the part where you blasted the wrong way and almost totaled me! - Yeah. Just, uh, testing the range. By the time Crystal walks up to the gates, I'll be ready. ♪♪♪ (Ringing) Hmm? Hello? "People for the ethical treatment of unicorns"? I gotta take this. Mobfairy 1: The fairy mobfather is thinking that you are avoiding your commitment to two hundred years of hard labor. - No, no, no! I just need a bit more time. What I have to trade is "ancient magic." Mobfairy 1: You have this wit' you now? - Not exactly, but I will. - Yes, you will, by five o'clock today, or else we double the years of service! - (Outraged) Double? Double, uh, my donation! Nothing is too good for those sweet, lovely unicorns. Bye! - I didn't know you liked unicorns. - Oh, you know me! Faybelle Thorn! I am so full of surprises. - Whoa! - Hm? - Uh, you guys go on ahead. My ski is falling apart. - Rosabella, I-I could carry you. - Are you finally thinking of something other than yourself? Ahhhh! - Why, no! I was thinking that you might enjoy hearing some stories about my greatest exploits. - When will you ever change? (Wind gusts) Jackie: He-he! The princess returns! Well, we have a little welcome planned for her! (Magical whoosh) (Small fart) - (Giggles) Welcome her with a... (fart) The staff did - (He cracks up laughing) - No, Northwind. You are the welcoming committee. (Snoring) - Shh. - Go down to the main hall and stop them. I will be sitting on the throne. Someone has to. - Cool, all part of the plan. Wait! How do I stop them? - Oh. You are a shape-shifter! Use your power. - All by myself? I'm afraid! There's a lot of them, and they have a beast! - And you have the power of ice! (Magical whoosh) - Awesome! - Show our princess what epic power looks like. Hahahah! - Wha... - Great work, Daring. Now, let's get to the throne room and find that rose of winter. But watch out for... - Me! That's right! Turn back by order of the new Queen of winter, my sister, Jackie. - (Chuckles) Okay. I got this. Don't worry. You and what army? (Chuckles) (Magical whoosh) - Daring! An ice giant! - Huh? Oh, no! - (Cackles) - Run! - (Roars) - Not the face! Not the face! (Frightened gasps) - Ho, ho, ho! Behold the power of winter! - Northwind! Nobody should get hurt for my sake! We're only here to save my parents! Please! Put him down! - My sister says that you just give orders. (Taunting) Pampered princess. - The princess said put him down! That wasn't an order, but call it a strong suggestion. - Hey, Northwind, you like frozen fireworks? - Aghhhh! - Ahh! - Split up! He can't get us all. Get behind the pillars! - Fe fi fo fum. Hee, hee. Always wanted to say that. - What a story! Will Crystal Winter be able to get to the throne room to find the rose of winter? Will she get her destiny back from the villainous Jackie Frost? Will... (Screams) (Frightened gasps) (Loud thumps) - My friends! Northwind! Over here! I'm the one you want! - Agh! (Gasps) (Loud footsteps thud) - Daring, we have to do something! Let's go! That's far enough! (Big roar) Wow! Those just might be the largest feet I have ever seen! - Cool, huh? Actually, it's my first time becoming an ice giant. - Come on, let's go! - Pretty awesome if I say so myself. - You are gigantic! - Thanks, guys. - By all standards... - Crystal, run! Get up to the throne room, - Okay. Come on, guys, let's go. - But hardly the most impressive. - Keep it up, Daring. - What? - Distracting the giant. (Gasps) - Hey! I'm not that dumb! (Rumbling, ice cracks) (Frightened gasps) (Calling over whimper) - Hey! - "Aim"... "ice"! - (Whimpers) - That's more like it! All right. Jackie rules! (Ringing) Hmm? Northwind, is it too much to ask if you have defeated the precious little princess and her pompous pack of minions? - Oh, we are totally winning. Except that Crystal and her friends got away and are heading towards you. - Agh. What part of that is "winning"? Argh. Okay, I'm doing this myself! Crystal is after the rose of winter? She's gonna have to get through me first. (Penguin call) - Thanks, you're a life saver. Mom? Dad? Jackie Frost, you better not have hurt them! - They're fine. And I'll do whatever I want. I'm the boss around here, not you! But-but this is not your place! You stole it! Jackie: (Chuckles) Boohoo-hoo! - Jackie, the staff of winter? It's too dangerous! The people and creatures of Ever After are being buried by this wicked winter! I know how to use it. - You don't know anything. You can't do anything. You don't deserve power. You just considered winter your playground. Fun, fun, fun! Some of us were doing all the work! - Yes, winter should be fun, and yes, it is work to prepare a good winter. But we should be working together! Each one doing our best. - You? The next Queen of winter? Ha! - Because I care. I care about all of the creatures of winter, because I've struggled, because I've climbed ice walls. I quested to find a cure for my parents. I've crossed the world. I risked everything to get back what I had, once upon a time. I understand what a great responsibility this is, and I am ready, not to rule, but to serve. - (Quietly) You tell her! - To help make winter fun for everyone. To use my powers to make others better. That means you, your brother, my parents, everyone. (Cheering) - You wanna use the immense power of winter to help others? Girl, I always thought you were a bit weird! - Jackie, please, give me the staff. Let me heal winter, for everyone. - Jackie's gonna blast-freeze Crystal. (Loud thuds, frightened whimpering) - Gotcha! Uh, well, no I don't. - Whoa! - How much longer do we have to keep playing this game of cat and mouse? - Daring! You're brilliant! - Yes, well, thank you. Wait? What? How? - Northwind is a shape-shifter. All we have to do is get him into a different shape. - Say, Northwind, old chap. Rosabella and I, we were just wondering... well, this is awkward... I say that you can choose any winter creature to shape-shift into... - That's right. I can. - But Rosabella here, uh... - I say that Daring is wrong. You can't. - (Upset) Hey! - But I'm on your side, old boy. Let me see, you were a polar bear... - (Roars) That's right. - Yes, um, an owl. - I do that one good! See? - Yes! And a snow mouse. - He was never a snow mouse. - Yes, I was. Wasn't I? - That's the problem. I say yes, and she says no. - I, Northwind, can turn into whatever Northwind wants to. (Squeak) - Now, Daring! Gotcha! - No worries! I'm guessing that this is all part of Jackie's plan. (Mad laughter) - Jackie, do the right thing. Give me the staff. Give me the rose of winter. You do not have the power to control it. You will only get hurt! - Pretty words from a pretty useless princess. A stolen destiny will never give you a happily ever after. Join me. - What if I do? I won't. Why should I? - You know I have no powers. My dad took them away. I stand before you, humbly, to ask you to turn back. Join me, and heal the world. Faybelle: Well, I'm going to take it! Hyaaah! I knew it was a trick! - No! Jackie! - (Laughing) You think you're a big deal? Well, I can be a big deal, too! (Magical whoosh) (Screaming) (Magical whoosh) - Now it's time to end this story, starting with your parents! - No! (Gasps) (Magical whoosh) - (Laughs) You wanna join her? Then you share her fate. - My wand of winter! (Magical whoosh) - What? (Magical whoosh) Agh! Aghh! Agh! - You want to play? Let's play. - Play? Ha, come back when you learn how to tie your own... Oh?

Not fair! (Pained cries) (Buzzer sounds) (Cheering) - Goal! What an upset! - (Cheering) - Agh! (Ice clinks) (Magical whoosh) You get to stay there until you learn to chillax! - You did it, all by yourself! - Oh, Crystal! That was amazing! Northwind: (Mad laughter) Hi, Jackie. Is this part of the plan, too? You're so clever! - Ugh. - We can finally cure the kindness blindness. ♪♪♪ (Magical whoosh) - (Gaps) Faybelle! - Sorry, gang. I need this more than you. - Those are to save my parents! - Faybelle, what trouble have you gotten into now? - I need these roses to save me from a fate worse than death... hard work! - Faybelle! Think of someone else for once! This affects ever after all of us. - Yeah, well, that would be a "you" problem, not a "me" problem. - (Gasps) - Buh-bye! - How will we cure your parents? - What do we do? - Penguins! Prepare the royal sleigh. We are going to follow that fairy! (Wind gusts) - Okay, I got the roses of the seasons. - We'll meet you at your locker. And yeah, we know where it is.

Old magic in exchange for my freedom. - And how do we know it's the real deal? (Rumbling) - Huh? (Bears roar) - Faybelle! I need those roses to save my parents! Fairy mobster 1: I-I'm thinkin' this is legit. - I need them to save myself. I signed a deal with the mobfairies to take my chores, my detention duty to clean up the school. (Crying) And I didn't read the fine print! Now I owe them 200 years of service. Unless I give them these. (Sigh) I'm sorry. - Oh, Faybelle. Fairy mobfairy 1: Boohoo. Either we get the roses, or we get the 200 years of service. Whassit gonna be? - I understand you felt that you didn't have a choice. - But I do. Faybelle, I choose to take your place. - What? - I'll take on your debt to the dark fairies. You'll be free, if you give the roses of the season back to Crystal. - You'd do that for me? - If the fairy mob will let me. - Makes no difference who's doing the work. No sweat off our wings. (Magical whoosh) - (Gasps) (Pen rasps) - Congratulations! - It's in the small print, if someone offers, and of their own free will, to take on the work, this contract is void! - You're off the hook. - Nice job, kid.

Male narrator : And what of Jackie Frost and Northwind? Female narrator: Well, as punishment for their trouble-making, they have to shovel the driveway.
