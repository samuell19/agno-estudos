(CHEERY WHISTLING) MAN: And cut! (EXCITED CHATTER) Wow. That was so amazing! Walter, you did a wonderful job. Thank you, Kermit. Did we get that? MISS PIGGY: We got it. We got it, yup. Movie's over, people. Go home. That is a wrap. Okay, nice work, everyone. Make sure to fill out your I-9s, and we'll see you on the next one. (SIGHS) So, uh... What do we do now? Well, we're together again. We got the theater and all our fans are back. Yeah! (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Actually, those were extras. I saw a few tapping their toes. Yeah, those were paid dancers. Oh. MISS PIGGY: Or... Maybe since we're all here, now could be the perfect time for you and me to tie the knot, Kermie! (STAMMERING) Well, I mean, maybe I could. Hey, what's the camera still doing here? Oh, no. Disaster! That can only mean one thing. Doggone it, you're right! Mmm-hmm. It looks like they've ordered a sequel.

It's about a frog who marries a beautiful, perfect pig. And they have to kiss each other a lot! Uh... (SPEAKING MOCK SWEDISH) How about a film about the existential conundrum of religious faith?

(ALL YELLING) (WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT) Let's dance. (GUARDS GROANING) (YELLS) (ALARM BUZZING) (PRISONERS SHOUTING) It's time to light the lights. (EXPLODING) Muppet news flash. Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog, has escaped from a maximum security gulag in Siberia, Russia. This move has leapfrogged Constantine to the number one most wanted criminal in the world, one place ahead of the mysterious Lemur. Wow. Thanks for seeing me at my regular booth, Muppets. (MUPPETS MURMURING) Big fan. Huge. Dominic. International tour manager. "Dominic Badguy"? It's pronounced "Bad-gee." (CLEARS THROAT) It's French. MUPPETS: Ah! It means "good man." Oh, yes. Oh! Listen up. You're hot. You're having a moment. But what is inevitable about a moment? It ends. I don't want this moment to end! That's why we got to get out there now and capitalize on this moment with a capital "C," yeah? I want you to conquer the world. Do an international tour. Show a global audience what you can do. (EXCITED CHATTER) Yeah, that sounds great but I'm just not sure... Wait a second, guys, listen. I'd love to do that, too. But we've barely gotten back together. We don't want to mess that up. Okay, I am inundated with offers of management at the moment. One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil. Just some of the acts I can list. (EXCLAIMING IN AWE) Wow, that's a good list! And now, I wanna tour manage you guys. I know you're the boss, Kermit. I wouldn't interfere with that. We would share our managerial roles because you've got a special bond with these little guys. Sure. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Uh... Oh! (SCOFFS) President Clinton? (MUPPETS GASPING) What? I'm on my way, Number Two. Great, they're taking the bait. Well, he seems like a nice guy. ROWLF: Yeah. Humble and honest. I just... I think we have to get settled first, you know? Hone the show, get some new material, and then maybe go on a world tour. DOMINIC: See you in Berlin. CONSTANTINE: Yes. Auf Wiedersehen... Number Two. (CHUCKLES EVILLY) So... What's it gonna be, Muppets? Ready to be world famous? No pressure, but I am a very busy man. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Oh! That's Rihanna. I really should take this. (MUPPETS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) World tour! World tour! Well, I mean... I guess we could always hone our acts on the road, and that would be okay. Wouldn't it, Kermit? ANIMAL: World tour! World tour! Come on, froggy! (INDISTINCT TALKING CONTINUES) Okay, let's do it. Dominic, you're hired. (CHEERING) Thanks, Kermit. I mean, boss. You won't regret this. (WOMAN ANNOUNCING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA) KERMIT: Is everybody here? Yeah? Okay, guys, guys. Get them up and move them out. All aboard, Dominic. I didn't know there was still third class. Third class? How about no class? (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh! Watch the heels! Piggy, why do you need so much luggage? For our honeymoon, of course! For our what? (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) BEAUREGARD: Let's go, guys! Oh! Oh. That must be reverse. Um... Oh, well. This way looks good, too. ♪ Down around the corner A half a mile from here ♪ KERMIT: Okay, Dominic, I thought we could start our world tour in London. DOMINIC: Or how about the world capital of comedy? Berlin, Germany. (MUPPETS CHEERING) ANIMAL: Germany! Hmm? Uh... Was that supposed to happen? Got me. KERMIT: Oh, you guys are gonna love this place. Hmm? Uh... Okay, here we are, guys. The Hole in the Wall Club! "Die Muppets"? Looks like they put the reviews up early. Yeah, or is that the suggestion box? (BOTH LAUGHING) MISS PIGGY: "Hole in the Wall Club"? More like "Hole in the Ground Club." Okay, everybody. So, we'll start at the bottom and work our way up. I've booked us into cabaret bars and coffee houses all across the industrial cities of Northern Germany. Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Mudburg, Vomitdorf. Poopenburgen? Fozzie, we have a solid week booked in Poopenburgen. Huh? (ALL MOANING) DOMINIC: This looks great. And I think we should commend Kermit on his efforts. KERMIT: Thank you, Dominic. Thanks. Or, if I might be so bold... KERMIT: Uh-huh? ...maybe we could consider another venue. Another venue? To be precise, this other venue. MUPPETS: Whoa! Look at that theater! KERMIT: What? No, no. We don't have the money to rent the Berlin National Theatre! We'll make our money back when we sell it out. Kermie, I've always dreamed of playing the Berlin National Theatre. "Ich bin ein Berliner." More like, "Ein frankfurter"! (MUPPETS CHUCKLING) Watch it, buster. Guys, I'm not sure we can do this, you know? DOMINIC: Okay, let's put this to the vote. All those in favor of believing in ourselves, raise your hands. (INDISTINCT TALKING) That's not what I'm saying. And all those in favor of just giving up. (SIGHING) I can't believe I'm voting for giving up. Good. Well, I'm glad we made this decision. Oh, wonderful! So cool! WALTER: Isn't that exciting. I can't believe it. All right, gather round, troops. Everybody? (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Okay, guys. Since we're playing such a big theater, let's stick with what we know. We'll open with a cabaret number... Kermit, when do I do the indoor running of the bulls? (BULL BELLOWING) (ALL EXCLAIMING) Mr. Kermit, sir? I would very much like to demonstrate my magnetic bomb-attractor vest. (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) Bunsen, why would you even invent one of those? Why did I invent the unexpectedly exploding cupcake? (SCREAMS) (ALL GASP) Hey, what about Muppet Ladder? Muppet Ladder? That's never, ever worked, Gonzo. Last time we all tried that was 20 years ago and you ended up in a cast for six months. Yeah, good times. MISS PIGGY: Kermit, what if I do four or five Celine Dion songs? You know Celine Dion, she works in Vegas. No, Piggy, there's no time for that. What about the band's marathon jam session? Drum solo! Drum solo! No drum solo! (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Guys, guys, guys! We can't just do whatever we want. This is our opening night. Let's play to our strengths, because... (SIGHS) Well... Look, I didn't want to worry you guys but if we don't sell this theater out, it would mean the end of the tour. (ALL GASP) GONZO: What? And maybe the end of us. Great news, Muppets. We're sold out. What? (ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY) Fine. I mean, great, great. Well done, Dominic. Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act. It's called "The Indoor Running of the Bulls." Gonzo, I've told you, that act is far too dangerous. Actually, Kermit, I was asking Dominic what he thinks. Good grief. MISS PIGGY: Dominic, Dominic! Five songs. (ALL CLAMORING) "Sold out." Like we've sold out a show in 30 years. Ahem. Is this a good time to discuss our upcoming European wedding? No, actually, I'm kind of busy right now. Perfect! I have 23 swatches for the seat covers for the reception, eight font choices for the menu, which, by the way, we are not serving flies. Piggy, what are you talking about? I'm just trying to involve you in some of the decision-making, dear. What about being involved in the decision to get married in the first place, huh? Oh, Kermit, you never let me do what I want! Oh, yeah? Well, what about what I want, huh? What about that? I haven't even proposed yet. You can do that on our honeymoon. What? (STAMMERING) That's insane! Do you hear what you're saying? Insane? How dare you call your fiancee insane? You are not my fiancee! We are not engaged! And, as a matter of fact, the way this particular conversation is going right now... Well... I'm fine with that! (GASPS) (FOO FOO GROWLING) KERMIT: Piggy, wait! I'm sorry! (FOO FOO BARKING) Get out! (KERMIT SIGHS) (DOMINIC SIGHS) Don't take it personally. They still love you. They just prefer me now. Uh, thank you, Dominic. That's very comforting. Do you know what I think helps sometimes in situations like this? What? A walk alone in the fog in former East Berlin. Maybe along a deserted canal. Well, I guess a quiet stroll is not a bad idea. Let the others know I've gone, will you? Sure. I promise. Thanks. Ah. (MAN SHOUTING IN GERMAN) (CHICKENS CLUCKING) (GREETS IN GERMAN) (CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY) (WHIMPERS) WOMAN: Corrine, come here! (GIRL GASPING) (SIGHS) Boo. (KERMIT SCREAMS) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) What just happened? (WOMAN SPEAKING GERMAN) It's him, he's here. The evil frog. The Evil Frog!! (IN ENGLISH) What? That's him. That's Constantine! Wait a second. (ALL CLAMORING) Hold on, hold on! There must be some mistake! Don't you know me? I'm Kermit the Frog! Silence, Constantine. The game is up. Who? (GASPS AND SCREAMS) No, no! Wait a minute! I'm Kermit the Frog! Guys, this is a mistake! I'm telling you! (SCREAMS) Hey, hey! Hello! Somebody! Open up! (SIREN BLARING) I'm an Amphibian-American! It's not easy being mean. (SNICKERING) (MUPPETS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Has anyone seen Kermit? Whoa! It's 15 minutes to curtain. Hi, guys. Look, it's Kermit, just back from his afternoon stroll. Hi-lo! I am Kermit. What... Hmm. DOMINIC: He's got a cold. That's why his voice sounds a little bit different at the moment. (ALL AGREEING) (COUGHS) See? Just calm down. Just relax. You are right. Dominic is terrific! Aw. From now on, let's do whatever he says. Hmm? ALL: All right. Yeah. Wow, that walk must have really helped. Miss Pig, I have wronged you. I humbly beg your forgiveness. You're not getting off that easy, bucko. Come on, Foo Foo. (HARUMPHS) (SNIFFING) Bad frog! Bad frog! (YELLING) What is this? Let go, dog! Animal, stop it! Kermit has agreed that Dominic is right all the time, man. DOMINIC: Good. So, now that Kermit agrees with me on everything... I am Kermit. Definitely. Let's go and hang out backstage, yeah? Okay, all right. Come, little friend. Let us get on with the show and enjoy our family-style adventure during which we shall bond and learn heartwarming lesson. Perhaps about sharing, or waiting your turn, or the number three. Hmm? Um... Right, Kermit. Uh... Sure. Flawlessly executed. Bravo. What did you expect from world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal, Number Two? Yeah, I know. You're number one, I'm number two. I think you mentioned that before. Now that we control the Muppet tour, Number Two, phase one of our plan is complete. We are now positioned to carry out greatest... (MUMBLING) Burgle... Blurgh-el... Burgle... "Burglary." Yes. ...of all time, and pin it on those gullible Muppets, who will spend the rest of their miserable lives behind bars. Hmm. Tonight... ...we steal the painting and then we'll have all we need to steal the unstealable, the Crown Jewels of England... Ensuring that my name goes down in history as greatest thief of all time! You mean our names, right? Of course. My name first, then spacebar, spacebar, spacebar, your name. DOMINIC: Sure.

What is the CIA doing here? This is my jurisdiction. Not to mention, my badge is bigger. One of the stolen paintings was on loan from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. So, this is CIA jurisdiction. Also, this is my travel badge. Here's my real badge. Oh. You must have been looking at the wrong... Badge! What? (SIGHS) You've won this round, Pierre. My name is "Jean." Okay, Shawn. It looks like we're gonna be working together. But that doesn't mean I have to like you. I didn't like you first. I didn't like you before I met you. So, what have we got? Two priceless paintings stolen and one average painting of an obscure English colonel. This has all the markings of the work of the Lemur. What's a lemur? Only the second most wanted criminal in the world. And my personal nemesis. Unfortunately for me, his identity is a mystery. No, literally, what is a lemur? Oh. It is also a rat-monkey from Madagascar. Oh. A-ha! Just as I suspected. This coin is his calling card. The Lemur, he is playing with us. I have a delivery here for Mr. Eagle. Right here. And here's your rope. Mmm. You were saying? DOMINIC: Look at that. "Muppets sell out in Berlin." Five stars! (ALL EXCLAIMING) Kermit the Frog is liking this news. Choo-choo, yeah! (CHUCKLES) Ooh, tunnel. (GRUNTS) Ooh! (MUFFLED YELLING) CONSTANTINE: (GROANS) It's not there. You were wrong! Not so fast. Oldest trick in the book. Write it in lemon juice, then simply apply heat to reveal Colonel Blood's map. Mmm... Of course, today, the Crown Jewels lie behind the most sophisticated security system on the planet. And this map, along with Blood's key and locket, is the only way to get close to them. Good work, Number Two. What does it say about location of Blood's key? Right. Something, something. "Finest wooden teeth." That is not helpful. Wait. There's the name of a city here. Madrid. (MAN SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN) KERMIT: You've got the wrong frog! (PRISONERS CLAMORING) (MUFFLED WHIMPERING) Hey, hey, hey! Ah! Ow. (MUFFLED TALKING) (GASPING) It's Constantine. What? He's back. What are you doing? I'm not Constantine. My name is Kermit.

Here, take prison crown. We have to readjust it again. Sergei, you get on that. Take, take. (SIGHS) Oh, thank you. Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) Wait a minute. I've known Constantine for years. And he has never... Ever... Said "Thank you." Because I am not Constantine. (WHIMPERS) How dare you? MISS POOGY: He's not Constantine! Let's throw him in the recycling compacter! Yeah! MISS POOGY: Throw him in the compacter! But I'm already green! MISS POOGY: Squash that frog! NADYA: Put the frog down. Or I will deploy. (KERMIT YELPS) (WHIMPERING) Where am I? The Gulag. A gulag?

It seems that Blood's key is hidden in a marble bust of his accomplice, Godfrey the Unknown, which is kept in the Statue Room at the Prado Museum. CONSTANTINE: Perfect. We break in, steal the bust, destroy it and grab key. Yeah, it's not that simple. You see, no one knows what Godfrey the Unknown looked like. Of course not. He was second in command, so no one cared. And there's 250 statues in that room. That may be problem. Let me think, huh, Number Two? (BREATHES DEEPLY) Hmm... Excusez-moi, Kermie. Do you have a moment? Kermit. I just wanted to say that I accept your apology and I'm ready to put our little disagreement or whatever it was, behind us. And, perhaps, I was a little too eager about our wedding... Pig, I have question. Am I wearing sign that says "Bother Me"? (GASPING) (BARKING) (MISS PIGGY SOBBING) What was that? What was that? Uh... I was in the middle of evilly plotting.

Do whatever the pig wants. Keep her happy. Whatever she asks of you. Stupid frog! Stupid train! Mm-hmm. I don't want to talk to you, Kermit. I said, I want you out!

That's where Blood's locket is. In the vaults of the Irish National Bank. Then I know where Muppet tour must stop next. Dublin. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Drum solo! (SIGHS) (SNORING) (SONG ENDS) Huh?

WALTER: Guys? I'm not sure that was such a great show. Like, what are you talking about? That jam was, like, totally epic. Exactly. And I'm glad to say the Spanish reviewers disagree with you as well, Walter. They loved us. Five out of five jamon serranos. Whoa. Those reviews really came out fast. And Citizen Kane only got four jamon serranos. DOMINIC: And more good news. Pack up, everyone. I've booked our next gig. In Dublin. Oh, great! Now we all have time to rehearse. Rehearse? Let's celebrate. Yeah! CONSTANTINE: Yes! You deserve it, comrades! Go do whatever you want. (GUARD WHIMPERS) Looks like we are busted. (GRUMBLING) Exactly what are we doing today? I am doing my job. All we need to do is look at the map with the blinky lights, and wait. This is how it is done here in Europe. In America, we use 3-D satellite LED displays. Not cardboard with Christmas lights stuck through it. A blinky light! She is blinking! Let's go. (BEEPING) What is this? A toy? This is my car, Le Maximum. It is illegal now in most of the EU for its massive size. It's so needlessly spacious, I feel guilty. (YELLS IN FRENCH) SAM THE EAGLE: I hate Europe. JEAN PIERRE: Madrid, here we come! Get out of the way. Stay on the road! JEAN PIERRE: Interpol! Excusez-moi. MAN: Watch out, everyone! JEAN PIERRE: 37 hours. Not bad. The Lemur. I knew it. This doesn't make any sense. Why break in, smash some priceless busts and then not steal anything? There must be something bigger going on. But what? Ah, I've got it! Oh, sorry. 2:00 PM. My day is over. Wait. Those weirdos, the Muppets, were performing next to the crime scene in Berlin. And here they are, performing right next to the crime scene in Madrid! You know what that means. Yes, they love museums! No! They're suspects! Okay. Overtime. We must find these Muppets before they flee the country. To the train station! Hey, Larry, want a bite of my bocadillos? (WOMAN YELPS) What the... Ah!

(SCREAMS) That's the second escape people try. (GRUNTING) (TOILET FLUSHES) Oh, boy. Third way! (SCREAMS) Give up, frog. I have Netflix account with search keywords "prison escape." I have seen every prison movie ever made. Even the ones in space. (SIGHS) Yeah, well... Hey, wait a second. That's them! That's my friends! What happened to them? "Dominic Badguy. "An interview with the brains behind "the Muppets' triumphant comeback world tour." What? It seems your friends do not need you anymore. They have forgotten about you. Oh, no, no, no. They wouldn't. They couldn't. We're a family. "Family"? No one believes in family in the Gulag, frog. People are only ever out for themselves. (SIGHS) Listen, Kermit. We have annual lighthearted Gulag Revue coming up. It is that, or they riot. I thought you might help me. Uh... The thing is, Nadya, I'm sort of done doing that, but thanks for the offer. This is not offer. This is prison. You are going to help me. Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM. Or I put you on The Wall. "The Wall"? Why would I be afraid of a wall? (GRUNTING) Just direct the show. You'll never escape. What time did you say that rehearsal was? Ouch! JEAN PIERRE: Okay. What about this comedian bear? He is too stupid to be stupid. He must be some sort of genius. Maybe your "Lemur" hunch is correct. (SIGHS) Except for the fact that Les Muppets play tomorrow night at the Dublin Theatre. Which just happens to be next door to the Irish National Bank! Maybe your Muppet hunch is... Correct. It's almost as if we're... BOTH: Not so different after all. Come, come, mon ami! We must follow Les Muppets to Dublin! To Dublin!

You're all terrible. Fix this. Or it's The Wall. Oh. Of course. Guys... It's always good to start with an up-tempo song and dance and then go into a comedy routine. But we like Boyz II Men! It is Big Papa's favorite song. Lot of emotions in that song for him. I'm not learning no other song. I'm a triple threat! A singer, a dancer and a murderer! There you go. How do you like that? ANIMAL: Drum solo! Drum solo! GONZO: When do I do the indoor running of the bulls? What about the band's marathon jam session? Four or five musical numbers. Quiet! Now, look! We are holding auditions tomorrow. And if any of you have a problem with that, any of you, then my door is always open! (PANTING) Thank you, Kermit. This is what we've all been waiting to hear. Teach us, Kermit. We will do whatever frog say. Put it there. Good night, frog. Nice work today. Thanks, Nadya. Even if your friends don't need you, we certainly do. Good night. Good night, Big Papa.

Huh? (GASPS) (PANTING) DOMINIC: Gentlemen. I need this review to go into Friday's paper. Super positive. Five stars. I won't be paid off for a review. I'm a journalist. I'm joking, of course. Cash or credit? (STATUE BREAKING) Oh! What was that? Rats. DOMINIC: Who cares? (WHISTLES) Hand these tickets out to anyone who will take one. In fact, you may have to actually pay people to come. It's the Muppets. It's not gonna be easy. Mmm. Oh. And I want a standing ovation. Oh, dear. Where does he keep all those suitcases? (MUNCHING) FOZZIE: Hmm. Let's see here. What's Kermit doing on the cover of this newspaper? (SHRIEKS) (LAUGHS) (PANTING) Oh! Ow! Dominic's the bad guy! Dominic's the bad guy! Fozzie! Mmm? Dominic's the reason we've been selling out our shows! He's been giving away tickets and bribing journalists to write great reviews! (GROANS) Why didn't we ever think of doing that? Huh? I mean, that's terrible! The question is, why? And could it have anything to do with why Kermit's been acting so weird lately? Hey, wanna see something funny? Yes, Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog. Fozzie, what does he have to do with what I just told you? Nothing, but check this out. A-ha! Oh, look, it's Kermit. FOZZIE: A-ha! (SHRIEKS) What did you do with Kermit? (THUNDER CRACKING) Wait a minute. Fozzie... What if Kermit has been replaced by this Constantine guy? (BULB BUZZES) Nah, that's impossible. We'd all notice! Wouldn't we? (KNOCKING) Kermit? Are... Are you there? Hello? FOZZIE: Kermit? Everything's fine. Let's get out of here. Wait! Whoa! We should look around. (TICKING) Huh. Kermit's got a big bomb collection. Looks like he's planning some sort of comedy heist bit. I hope not. Those never work. Mmm. WALTER: What's that? (GASPS) Oh, no. What, what, what? What? Oh, no.

CONSTANTINE: Comrades, I'm afraid I have bad news. Walter and Fonzie have quit the Muppets. (ALL GASP) LEW ZEALAND: Wait. You can quit the Muppets? Wait a second. Walter quit the Muppets? We just did a whole movie where he joined the Muppets. Yeah, we sure spent a lot of time on it. RIZZO: Ha! I'll say. Maybe even at the expense of other long-standing, beloved Muppets. Come on, Robin. (SIGHS) Coming. Well, as the old saying goes... The show must continue, in a timely fashion. GONZO: Wait. Fozzie and Walter are part of our family. We can't let them go without a fight.

ALL: What? ...to be married in two days' time at the world's most romantic location, the Tower of London. (ALL CLAMORING) Here's a Muppet newsflash. The years of waiting are over. The biggest "Will they, won't they?" of all times has been answered with a firm "They will." Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are to be married! That's right, folks. They're finally tying the knot. (SOBBING) Well, at least they didn't get the pot of gold. No, they did not. I have never been to a more ridiculous crime scene. (JEAN PIERRE GASPS) The comedian bear, he was here. SAM THE EAGLE: The Lemur. He, too, was here. Could the comedian bear and the Lemur be one and the same? The comedian bear is the Lemur. That is brilliant. But why would he steal a bunch of old bones? The bones apparently belonged to one Colonel Thomas Blood. He was the only man to ever nearly steal the Crown Jewels of England. Wait! Where did the frog say he was getting married? The Tower of London. BOTH: The comedian bear is planning on stealing... The Tower of London! The Crown Jewels! The Crown Jewels. (SIGHS) Sir, where would you like the flowers? Who cares? Hey, chief. Hi-lo. Uh, we've all been thinking, and... Well, after you and Miss Piggy get married, what's gonna happen to the tour? And to us? Well, now you guys have all the freedom you want. You don't need me.

They're planning something terrible, but we don't know what. But... How could you not have noticed that he'd replaced me, Fozzie? He looked like you and he talked like you. Okay, he didn't talk that much like you, come to think of it. But he said he had a cold. Animal know. "Animal know"? Mmm-hmm. You mean, all this time, I've been locked in a Russian gulag, no one, not one single person from the Muppets except Animal noticed I'd been replaced by an evil criminal mastermind?

You are my insurance policy! Huh? Number Two, you look ridiculous. Why are you wearing that? Because I am the Lemur. And the world's new number one criminal. That's right. This is where I double-cross you. First rule of double-cross. You don't announce the double-cross before you double-cross. It's not even a rule because it is so obvious.

Oh, Kermie... I'm so glad you did. ROWLF: Okay. Can we get down now? (SIRENS APPROACHING) We did it, guys! (ALL CHEERING) SCOOTER: What an action sequence! LEW ZEALAND: You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy. Thank you. Congratulations, weirdos, you've saved the Crown Jewels! And you've caught my nemesis, the Lemur. Look at his little costume. That's adorable! I'm not adorable. He is adorable. You're adorable! Did you make that kitty-cat outfit? The bad guy is Dominic Badguy! (ALL GASP) Well, mon ami, I guess this is where we say goodbye. You go your way, and I go mine. (SOBBING) Here comes the rain. Oh, boy. And I said I wasn't going to do this. Oh, pull yourself together, man. Stop crying. We're only saying our final farewell. Goodbye forever! (SOBBING) I'm going to miss you so much! I'm going to miss you, my French friend. (ALL GROANING) Whenever you're ready. Yes. Yes, of course. Take them away! Take them away! DOMINIC: Thank you. Au revoir, Muppets. Bye-bye. See you! DOMINIC: You're number two. CONSTANTINE: Shut up. Sam! Wait for me! (SIGHS) You know... I missed all of you so much. NADYA: There he is, right there! Arrest him! Arrest that frog! Nadya? Wait. For what? For leading the largest mass break-out in Gulag history. You will get 30 years. Maybe 50. But... No "buts," Kermit. You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue, and you didn't even say goodbye. What? What? You are coming with me. Now, move! (STAMMERING) Fellas, listen. Easy. No, no, no! Kermit! Wait! We're sorry, Kermit. We're sorry that we didn't notice you were missing. We're sorry we didn't tell you often enough how much you mean to all of us. We're sorry we ever took you for granted. But that's never going to happen again. Because if Kermit has to go back to the gulag... You'll have to take me, too. No. You're my best friend, Kermit. Wherever you go, I go. You'll have to take me, too. And me. Kermit, we convinced ourselves that evil frog was you because he gave us what we thought we wanted. When what we really wanted... What we really needed... Was you, Kermit. The actual, real you. It would appear you were right, Kermit. I guess this is your family. And families belong together. You are free to go. (ALL GASP) Forever. (ALL CHEERING) Kermit, did you hear that? We're free! Nadya, thank you! Great! That's wonderful! Wait! Hey, guys, listen. We still have to finish our world tour. And I know where we need to play next. For one night only... Siberia, Russia! (ALL CHEERING) Yes, yes! I'll pack my swimsuit right away! Oh, wonderful! It's terrible. You will hate it. You will hate it. KERMIT: Okay, guys, this is it. The Gulag Finale! Here we go!

Rowlf, come here. Come here, come here. ROWLF: Yeah, what do you got there? FOZZIE: Take this. (ROWLF GRUNTING) You should have negotiated a smaller font size. (GROANS LOUDLY) (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) I believe I may have something that could help. This is my automated end-crawl operating machine. All I have to do is push this button, and it will crawl all by itself. (CONTINUES GRUNTING) Whoa! (BEAKER SCREAMING) Oh. Let's try this. (SWEETUMS GROANS) (BEAKER SCREAMING) Another qualified success. (BEAKER MOANING) (SWEETUMS GROANING) Check this out. (LAUGHS) You can go home now, Ma. The movie is over.
