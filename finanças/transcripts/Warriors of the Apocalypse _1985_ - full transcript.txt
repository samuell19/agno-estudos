23.976 fps Warriors of the Apocalypse The time: 150 years into the future. The place: Earth. Earth, ravaged by wars in a world gone mad. Mankind returning to the Dark Ages, roaming a barren planet, resorting to brute force and killer instinct... ...for survival. Trapper... Let's get rid of the old bastard. Damn it, I make the decisions around here. Water - water! - Snake, no! - I gotta drink! I gotta drink! Too bad. Collect all the canteens, Doc. Again? - Let's have it. - Get out of here! Don't ever do that again or I'll blow your brains to kingdom come. Doc, you stay. No way. Drop the weapons! Also the knife. You too! Come on, get out of here! Shit. Trapper, we have enough food and supplies to last for a couple of days. But was it necessary to kill all of them? You have to. - What about those two? - Cut 'em loose. Heh heh. Get up, get up! Ya, ya! What's it gonna be! You think you're so smart, but you're not... Not so big now, eh? Say, what about the one that saved your neck? - Haven't seen him. - I don't know. I only saw him for that moment, then he disappeared. Hey, Snake. Take a look in here. Hey, what's this stuff? - I've never seen anything like that before. - Hey, let me see that! Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. This appears to be gold! - Gold? What's that? - Well, it's the most precious metal in the world. It's worth a lot of money. - Money, that paper stuff they used to trade items for, 90, 100 years ago? - Yes. And people have even killed each other for that. And now - worthless. Trapper! Well, looky here. Easy! Easy, no more killing. Who are you? I'm Anuk. You want food? Where did you get all this stuff? Nothing like this has grown for generations. - From the mountain of life. - From the mountain of life? Yes. The mountain of life! So it is true, Trapper. There were people who escaped the Great Wars! People who found a place where they could continue the new civilization! - Don't you see? - Aw, come on, Doc, you're a man of science. You know better. Heh, he still has the gold and believes it's valuable. How old are you? I'm not sure, - ...but I was 35 years old when the Wars began. - Crazy! You're right. It's crazy. That would make him almost 100 years old. What if he's not crazy? What if he could take us there? - Aw, come on, you're both nuts! - Where else have we got to go? Trapper! Wait a minute! God damn it! All right, Doc. We'll try it your way. It's time to get outta here! Those four can go their way - we'll go find this voodoo mountain! Go on. What is it? The silence. We go on. We go quiet. They might come back. Weedy, look out! How are we gonna get out of this mess? Hell, why ask me? Trapper? Yeah, Trapper. You got any more good ideas? That'll depend on how they intend to kill us, Raunchy. I know you've been following us for a couple of days now, but why the hell did you risk your lives to save us? - We're just returning a favor to you. - Come on, Tegul. Tell him why. If the two of you want to join us, you're most welcome. Thanks for your offer, but we have to go back to Giant Bill. He needs us more than ever now. Come on, Abraham. Tell him what we want, or the giant will die. We need food and medicine if you have it. Giant Bill's pretty sick, after you beat him so bad. I don't need to know why you're sticking with Giant Bill. But you're more than welcome to half of what we've got. Weedy, give him what we have. - Give them food and water! - Leave, Abraham, or we will not see him alive. Goodbye. I admire your courage, and your loyalty to a man who once made slaves of you. He treated you both as animals. Good luck. These two are crazy. They are human beings. Probably the last of a breed with compassion. How far are we from your people? Look around. Don't you see the signs of life? Spread out! Take cover! - Aw, not again! - You'd better believe it! Let's proceed. It can't be. Everyone OK? Doc... You all right? Everyone down! Better let me look at that. It's nothing. I'll be all right. - You will die soon without treatment. - Is it poison? - Trapper, I tell you, something weird's going on around here. - What are you talking about? They're the same friggin' runts we killed before! - It's one of them. - One of them? All of them. Let's get out of here. Where do we go from here? We're going back. We're not. How's the arm? - Fine. - Let me see it. I don't believe it! Not a trace of the wound. - Are you sure? - Hey! Let's stop this bullshitting around. I wanna know. Are we going back or what? What the hell are you doing here? Snake! Don't waste your ammunition! It won't do any good. What do you mean? It's useless. They possess a magic which makes them... immortal. Nonsense! No one's immortal. I am. ...as they are. Nana, what's happening? - Anuk and Bunkou are with some men. - Oh... - Men! - Come on! Bunkou, you know what to do with them. Kneel! I said kneel! Now! Now! Naah! ...Now! A poor specimen. Why did you bring him? His scientific knowledge could be of use. Say, Trapper, did you notice the altar on top of this temple? Yes, it appeared to be like a voodoo sacrificial altar. What are you saying? Yes, well, I once heard... ...that they've had ritual blood sacrifices. Human sacrifices? No, I never heard about any human sacrifices. Trapper - you've got to come up with a plan to get us the hell out of here. Just when things were starting to look up? I'm telling you now: This place is evil. I can feel it! Trapper! At first break of day, you must take your men and leave this place... Never to return. - What's happening? - The prisoners! Escaped! - What's going on? - The prisoners escaped! - Girls, get your weapons and follow me. - Yes! Come on! What now? Take your pick! Shut up, or I'll - You'll do what? Yeah, what? Gentlemen, please! Why can't we settle our differences later on? That is, if we can get out of this jungle alive. - We'll take the trail on the right. - Ah, that's OK with me. Let them do what they want to, Doc. How 'bout you, Dewey? - Hell, who cares? - Weedy? After you. They took this trail! They took this path! Come on! All right! Come on, lady! - Don't! Get off - - Hey, come on! - Come on, stop foolin' around! We gotta get out of here! - Hey, what are you doing, Snake? Take your hands off me! Look out! Get down, Doc! They split into two groups! - I'll take this way! - We'll take the other path! - Right! - Princess! Princess, please wait! - They're armed! Too dangerous! - That's what we've been expecting. Come on! Hey! Get a load of this. Try that, huh? As you're rollin'. Not bad, huh? Nobody rolls quicker than you do. Have a hit. Yeah... All right, all right. Go in peace, brother. Take care of them. By now you know it's useless to try to escape. You mean you set us up! You must have been dreaming. It's a serious offense to accuse a High Priest of treachery. Yeah, well... maybe it was just a dream. Good! Come with me. The rest of you are free to move around. But I warn you: Any attempt to escape will be dealt with severely! I thought you said we were gonna have a lot of fun and games when we got here. Just be patient. Your time will come. That's gonna be a little difficult, with all them half-naked ladies runnin' around. Why can't we just get on with it? Our customs are different from yours. We must wait for a full moon, for our fertility ritual. Hey, you guys know what that means? I got a couple ideas. But suppose we let Anuk here give us the details. When the time comes, you will see for yourself. In the meantime, anything wrong with us getting to know the girls a little bit better? As Guruk said, you are free to move around the village. Well, what are we waitin' for? Snake? I think it's funtime! Come on in! Say, Anuk. Everlasting life... Miracle medicines. Raising the living from the dead! Fertility rites! Is there anything you people cannot do? It will do you no good to ask questions. For the future is beyond your control. What about the drones? - I have said all I intend to say. - Were they like us, before? Out! Out, he'll be mine! You have to wait for the full moon. Wait for the fertility rites! - Hey, come on, honey, come here! What's she talking about? - Be patient! Stay there. Wait! - a full moon? Please, rise. How did you get out? You must have had help. Trade secret. One you won't have to resort to again, if you keep your word you and your men won't try to escape. I cannot speak for them. But you are their leader! I can only guarantee you - I'll do what I have to do. So will I. If you should try to escape again, I can't guarantee you'll be so lucky a second time. - Fair enough. - That will be all for now. This one is different than the others. - He could be trouble. - Nothing I can't handle. - I haven't seen food like this in a long, long time. - Man, you can say that again. May I ask-? Is it true that she's over a hundred years old? Closer to 175. 175, amazing! Are you really that old? - Why, you have something against older women? - No... Not if they're as beautiful as you are. You should not have followed us! O, supreme fertility gods! We call upon you to administer justice to those who have defied your wishes! Thy will be done! Bunkou! Your life is in the hands of the gods. Anuk! You overestimate him. He is no test for Anuk. You speak with the heart of a woman. Not as a Princess. No! How dare you interfere with the will of the gods? The will of the gods? Or the will of Guruk, the man? He must be punished. His humiliation is punishment enough. Perhaps you're right. Now you see him for what he really is. What's that? My god! Who are they? They were from a different village. They were here to capture the Princess. And that's all you need to know. He's lying! There is something funny going on inside that cave! What makes you so sure? Trust me! I know what I'm talking about. O supreme fertility god! Master and creator of all life! With this blood sacrifice, we beseech you to bestow your spirit upon us, granting new and eternal life to your loyal and faithful servants! Come to me. This night belongs to us. There's nothing I'd like better. But you are Guruk's woman. Him? He's past his prime. Even Guruk cannot fight the will of the fertility gods. I have never known love. I felt that the moment I saw you. You are everything I need. Guruk is nothing! I loathe him! Tonight is our beginning. Tomorrow, Guruk will be as nothing. Oh, my love! Move. Move! - You should not be here. You could be killed. - This place is absolutely amazing! You have managed to convert an ancient reactor into a positive force! One designed to turn a scorched mountain into a lush paradise. A fool's dream for mankind's future. But you've achieved marvelous results. Up there, yes. Down here, slavery. Heathen natives condemned to die from contamination. Guruk, tell me. How have you achieved eternal life? The voodoo gods have been good. They have seen fit to extend my life as well as that of Sheela. And the others? For example, the pygmies coming back to life? I control the pygmies and the drones through powers from the Energizer. Once I die, they will become mortals. The same for the Daughters, if Sheela dies. But both of you are immortal! Without grace from the voodoo gods, and the power transfusions from the Energizer, we too are sure to pass from this life. Love me! Love me, love me! Oh, my love! My love! Please! I tried to help you before. Take your companions and leave this place before Sheela destroys us all! Your weapons are behind the altar. Now go. Go! Tell me you love me! Don't think of what has gone before! I'll destroy Guruk. I loathe him, loathe him, loathe him! Oh, darling! Tomorrow, like the morning fog, Guruk will burn away with the sunrise! And you and I will live forever! Forever... I... never felt this way before. I would like to believe that. You've touched me like no one else I've ever known. Really? Or do you say that to all your victims? No. Somehow, this time, it's different. Together we can build a whole new Empire. With you as my King, we can rule the world! You're forgetting one small detail. Guruk? He's useless. I'll take care of him in my own way, today. Trapper, I gotta talk to you! - Now? - Yes, right now. Hey Doc, this better be important. I was about to become King. Forget it. The woman is evil. You must see her for what she is. She intends to dominate the world! By force! He's lying! Don't listen! No! I wanna hear what he has to say. Sheela - I beg of you. Don't let greed and lust overtake reason! Reason? You talk like a fool. O supreme god! Highest of all! I beseech your spirit to give me the strength to overcome the evil forces against you! What in the hell is going on? The honeymoon is over! Get your gear, we're getting out of here! Enough! You must go after the men! Be sure they bring back Trapper. What are you waiting for? Weedy, hold it! We'll wait for Doc. Raunchy, take the point. I'll bring up the rear. No, Anuk! Stop it! There's been enough killing! What, are you crazy? They're immortal anyway! With Guruk out of the way, they're as immortal as you and me. Please, no more killing! It's all over! And Sheela? She's dead. So, what now? I see a future here. It's either that, or back to the barren wastelands. I'm staying here to help rebuild. The rest of you? Well, that's up to you. Timing by Eazin
