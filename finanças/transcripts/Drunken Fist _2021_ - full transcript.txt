Charge! [In the late years of Qing Dinasty.] [It's in domestic trouble and foreign invasion. The society is in chaos.] [People suffer a lot, and live on the edge of starvation.] [In the Imperial Court, in the Martial World and among the ordinary people.] [Heroes stand up one by one] [The keep fighting in a foul of wind, rain and blood.] [Su Qier's Martial Arts Are Unparalleled] [Six years earlier] The property transported by corrupt official Shi Buquan is worth a lot. Now, let's discuss. What we should do with this ill-gotten gain? Shi Buquan has already sent someone to negotiate with me, asking us Thirteen Province Escort Agency to help him move it. If second brother lose the goods, it will definitely ruin his reputation. We have to think of a surefire solution. Big Brother, Second Brother, I have a good idea. It can both save second brother as well as secure this ill-gotten gain. What is it? Tell me. Second brother, where did Shi Buquan ask you to hand over the goods at? Where did Shi Buquan ask you to hand over the goods at? At Wanhua Forest. Wanhua Forest... That makes things easy. At that time, Big Brother can lead someone to rob him in advance first so it has nothing to do with Second Brother. As for the government, as long as I don't check, no one else can find any clues. Good! That's safer. Second Brother, what do you think? Third Brother is indeed really thoughtful. However, this is no small matter. We need someone else to help to make it foolproof. Who would this someone be? If I'm not mistaken, the person the second brother is talking about is Hong Rixin, Elder Hong. That's right. Come on, brothers. - Cheers! - Cheers! Lao Gui Xin! There is something delicious! It's roast chicken! Where is he? Lao Gui Xin! That's weird. Where did he go? Not this again, Lao Gui Xin. It's time to practice your martial arts. Don't waste time. You make me either meditate or do handstands everyday. Not even a single move has been taught. What kind of kung fu is that? Su Can, do you want to be a third-rate master or a top-notch master? A top-notch master, worldly hero, of course. Keep it up. You're not far from becoming one. Get up! Su Can, do you still remember the Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You formula I taught you? - Yes. - Recite it. There are fish in the north, called Kun. Kun is so huge no one knows how many miles it goes on for. It turned into a bird, called Peng. The back of a Peng, no one knows how many miles it goes on for. If it's good, come again! You're just staring, doing nothing. Are you thinking of Lady W-Wan? Get away. You picked up a tattered satchet and think of it as a treasure. You will never see her in real life. My god, my words came true? Speak of the devil. - Lady Wan. - Lady Wan looks so energetic. Is it because she's in- In love... Why are you hiding? Do you owe her money? What money. Go away! Why do you have time to visit the market? None of your business. You're the young lady of the Thirteen Province Escord Agency, you shouldn't be in places like this. Keep your voice down, want everyone to hear you? Is that so? You are a coward. You'll be a bachelor for the rest of your life. You go if you think you can. Okay. Just you wait. Fatty. Fatty! This place is not somewhere you should be. Why don't we go have tea together? You are so annoying, get out of the way. Get out of the way! My god you're annoying. Stop. - What are you doing? - R-robbing. What rob? Do you know who my father is? Get out of my way! I-I'll go get some help. You hold on, you hold on... Hey! Are you even a man? He's nothing. You're robbing, right? I have no money. Normally people rob for money. But not me. I want to rob... I... Hey, let me tell you. I-it's broad daylight. D-don't even think about it. I'm going to shout! Let go of that girl! He's useless. I was reckless. Hit him hard! How dare you rob. All right, stop hitting him. If you continue hitting him, he's going to die. What's the use of keeping this kind of scum alive? Miss, don't be afraid. I'm going to bring you justice today. Stop! That's enough. Hit me anymore you better return my money- Shh. Shh. Go! Let's go! Ouch. I should make better friends. Thank you for just now. - No problem. - You are brave. There were so many people on the street just now but you were the only one who dared to rush out. What's that? - It's nothing. - Hey, stop! Take it out. Hurry! Isn't this my sachet? I lost it a long time ago. It was stolen by a thief like you? I didn't steal it, I picked it up. - You picked it up? Who can prove that? - Fatty can. Fatty? The fatty that was trying to rob me? So you two are in cahoots! Miss, don't be misunderstood. That's not what it is. I-I... I... All right. Although you two cheated me, but on the sake that you drove away that annoying Zhao Kun for me, I will let you off. Wait, no. Cheating is cheating after all. I still have to punish you. You can punish me any way you want. I will punish you to fulfill three of my wishes. What wishes do you have? My greatest wish is that there is someone who can spend free time watching the dawn with me, and have meals with me. What does that mean? Forget it. I won't put you on the spot. My dad refuses to let me out. My first wish is for you to bring me around Jiang City. Then you've found the right person, miss. I'm the most familiar with this Jiang City. Come with me. Can, you have to thank me this time. If it weren't for my heroic dedication, how can you have the blessing to go shopping with Lady Wan? I do have to thank you. But you made me suffer. You caused my image as a handsome man plummet in a beauty's heart. You have to buy me a drink to make up for it. All right. Let's go drink! - That's more like it. - I don't have any money. It's you, you rascal! It's really you! We meet again. What do you want? Are you up to no good again? I know how to kill pigs with a knife. We don't know who's up to no good yet. Go! Hold up! Let's go one-on-one! We will all go one-on-one on you! Stop. Long time no see, Lady Bai. A beautiful lady like you shouldn't meddle in things like this. Don't bully people! It has always been men who save damsels in distress. I've never seen a lady save bears in distress. What dog, what bear? Stop blabbering. Keep hitting them! Everyone, come and see! The son of the Jiang City Guard is bullying commoners in public! Is there still any law? I'll stop for your sake today. Stop! You two, don't let me see you again. Every time I see you, I will hit you. Go! I should've brought my knife today. Are you two okay? We're fine. Thank you for saving us. Thank you. Can, you're so charming. Stop talking nonsense, Fatty. Thank you heroine, for saving us. Let us buy you a drink. Thanks, but no need. Another time maybe. How shocking. Lady Wan, what a coincidence! Get away! I have business with you. What kind of business could you have? I have a dispatch from the court here for the Escort Agency. Why don't you help me pass it on to Mr. Wan. Is this real? Yes. Pass me the letter then. I'll take you to take it. Come. Don't worry, sir. Our pork is definitely fresh. Okay. Lady Wan? Zhao Kun? Why are they together? No, I have to hurry up and find Can. Where's the letter? We're in no rush. Actually, today I want to apologize to you for what happened last time. Instead of wine, let's drink tea. I hope Lady Wan can forgive me That's not necessary. Just give me the letter If you're not giving me the letter, I'll be on my way. If you delay the affairs of the court, your father will be killed. So- So what do you want to do? If you drink this cup of tea, it means you forgive me. Then I'll give you the letter. I drank it. You can give me the letter now- Give me the letter... It's thanks to Elder Hong that it turned out so smoothly this time. You are welcome. We are all on the same boat. Helping you is also accumulating my merit. What are you doing? You son of a bitch! Come here! Chunxiao. What did you give her? No! Nothing! What did you give her? Just a bowl of Mongolian medicine. Sit down. Mongolian medicine, right? A bowl? Tastes good? Chunxiao? Chunxiao. Can. Why are you here? You were drugged by Zhao Kun. Fortunately, Fatty found out in time. Then he didn't do anything to me, did he? You're fine. Get up. Still dare to act all arrogant? Big brother! Stop. Big brother. - Elder Hong. - Second brother. Big brother, is everything going well? Very well. Shi Buquan couldn't resist at all. We got all their ill-gotten gains. Great. Then send someone to notify Third Brother. That's good. We can have Third Brother make some preparations in advance to take this ill-gotten gain and distribute it amongst the commoners from whom these were taken from to start with. All right. Inform your Third Brother than it's done. Yes. We Should hurry. I have a bad feeling. We shouldn't stay here for too long. Let's hurry on. All right. Let's be on our way. - Go! - Go! Who's there? How dare you play tricks on us! Come out! Play tricks? I am the best martial artist in the world. Is that what nobodies like you can achieve? Big brother, he is the Noble Martial Sage. He's been going around challenging everyone. He killed the leader of the Wulin Alliance. You're a senior. Sorry for being rude. I didn't mean to offend you. Martial Sage, we have never crossed your path. What is your purpose of stopping us? I heard that there are a lot of masters in your Eighty-One Sect. The head Ji Yinqiu is also the master of masters. He's said to be number one in the world. One of the greatest joys in my life is to compete with masters. Defeating you will make me number one in the world. I have something important to do today. How about I visit you another day? How can the head of the Eighty-One sect be so cowardly. Cut the crap. Make your move. Go! - Go! - Charge! You can come together. Including you, Head Ji. Big Brother. He's so heavy. - Fatty. - Huh? Let's just leave him here. Okay. We are giving you a chance. If you dare do anything again, I will kick you off. Fatty. - Huh? - Come here. Whoa. What a scene. Head of the Eighty-One Sect, Chief Escort of the Thirteen Province Escort Agency, are all just names! You're nothing! Master? It's you? Hong Rixin? Good brother. You didn't think I was still alive, right? Good... Very well! Things you search for so hard but to no avail often come to you instead. Since you are here, then hand over the second half of Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You. Wishful thinking, you traitor! Master! You want to die? They're all martial artists out there! I have to save my master! Move aside! Can! You should at least bring along a knife with you! Wait for me, I'll go back and get the knife! Lao Gui Xin! Are you okay? I'm okay. Clear landscape, the flora is vibrant. Spring comes and winter goes, life and death. Flowers and leaves, make their way down! A pure Yang body. Master! Master, Master! It seems like Jianghu doesn't need me anymore. Elder Hong, Elder Hong! Wei, don't disturb Elder Hong. It's you! Do you know my daughter? So she's Lord Bai's daughter? She had saved me once. I didn't even get the chance to thank her. I didn't expect to meet her here. What a coincidence! Elder Hong. Lao Gui Xin, you're awake? I'm awake. Wei, feed Elder Hong the medicine. Give it to me. Elder Hong, how do you feel? I have quit Jianghu. Eighty-One Sect will depend on your youngsters moving forward. Lao Gui Xin, what is Eighty-One Sect? Eighty-One Sect... What do you all do? Hero Su, us Eighty-One Sect came together to fight for the people's safety and livelihood. Elder Hong is the great senior of our Eighty-One Sect. Who was that martial sage just now then? This... Since everyone is here, I won't hide anymore. About 40 years ago, my master Xiaoyao Zhenren created Taoism. He penetrate the cycle of heaven and made everything alive. He cultivate a set of unprecedented and unparalleled martial arts Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You. Martial Sage and I used to be of the same sect. Disciple, more than your junior, you are an honest man. I have decided to pass you the position of the head of the sect and to teach you Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You. But you have to remember, we must make this sect shine bright. Do more good things for the country and the people. Yes, Master. In order to get the Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You formula, Martial Sage poisoned the tea that Master was going to have. Master, please drink. You! Go to hell, you old man. I'm the one who should be number one in the world! I want to be number one in the world! Su Can is a once-in-a-hundred-year pure Yang body. Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You can only be completed with a pure Yang body and a pure Yin body. Martial Stage isn't a pure Yang body, but have decades of internal cultivation. With the second half of Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You, you only need to find a pure Yin body to absorb it to reach the highest cultivation one can ever get. As Su Can was congenitally pure Yang, and subdues the Martial Sage, they will definitely clash in the future. Head Escort Wan. Apologies for the offense. Apprehend him! Lord. Is there a misunderstanding? Lord Shi's items went missing. They are suspecting you now. When I went to pick up his items, no one showed up. I thought Lord Shi had something else to do so we left. Head Escort Wan, the innocent will never be found guilty. If nothing is found after an investigation, you may return. Apprehend them! Let me see who dares to! In broad daylight, how dare you arrest people for no reason. Chunxiao. Stop. I will go with them. Dad! This is a small gift from Wan's residence. I would like to ask Uncle to release my father. Niece, don't stand on ceremony. This is a complicated matter. The court is investigating. He can't be released for now. Chunxiao, don't be anxious. The truth will be out soon. I'd like to ask Uncle to help with the situation too. I shall thank you here in my father's sake. You are welcome. Head Escort Wan's problem is my problem. I will do my best. In that case, I shall make my leave. Kun. Yes. Chunxiao. My dad asked me to give this back to you. Chunxiao. Actually, to save your father, there is another way. What way is it? As long as you are willing to accompany me for one night, I'll let my dad let your dad go. If you want to save your father, better think about it Don't worry too much. I'll find a way to save your father. Really? Have you forgotten? I still owe you two wishes. I was just kidding. I'm not. Don't worry. Thank you. No problem. I will... Protect you forever. I just got the message. Three days later, Second Brother will be taken to the capital. We have to figure a way to save him. Yes. We have to find a way. Second Brother is being kept a close eye on by Zhao Wuji. There hasn't been a chance for us to save him. The escort to the capital this time is a chance. To get to the capital, they have to go through Fulin town. Let's make our move there. Let's just go with the flow. Once we startle them, it will become difficult. Elder Hong's reminder is right. Stop. Head Escort Wan, Lord Zhao is here to see you. If you surrendered to me earlier, you wouldn't have to go through this physical pain. Dream on! As long as I can get out, I won't forgive you! Still being stubborn? Come on, feed him. You... What did you feed me? This is the secret medicine for Martial Sage cultivation. It's called Jiu Yang Yi Jing pill. It specially deals with people who aren't obedient. If there is no antidote, your internal organs will bleed and you will die going crazy. Despicable... How despicable! If you are obedient and help me capture the Eighty-One Sect, and take down Bai Hongming, I'll give you the ultimate antidote. Second Brother, are you okay? Second Brother, what are you doing? By order of the court, apprehend Ji Yinqiu and his gang of rebels! Big Brother. Are you crazy? Wan Lingquan, you broke your oath and became a traitor! Why? I'm going to kill you! Big Brother, let's go. Why? Why? Go, let's go! Dad! Did Su Can save you? - Don't mention that beggar again. - Why, Dad? He is now a court criminal. You are not allowed to be in contact again anymore. Come in. From now on, the Thirteen Province Escort Agency is dismissed. I, will become the Head of Jiang City Province. Those who are willing to follow me, continue to serve. Congratulations to Head Escort on becoming the Head of Jiang City Province! Search! Be sure to catch Ji Yinqiu and Su Can! Report sir, there's no one. Sir, there is no one! Chief. Chief! Bad news. Our counterfeit products were taken away by Wan Lingquan! So fast? Elder Hong indeed has foresight. Why did Wan Lingquan betray everyone? There must be a reason. We have to plan ahead. This traitor! Dad, any news? Wan Lingquan has taken office as Head of Jiang City Province. With military power, he will definitely hold a city-wide search soon. We should quickly leave. This bastard... He betrayed us for glory and wealth! I was so blind. Third Brother, you should also evacuate with us. Big Brother, go without me. As the Prefect of Jiang City, only the court can investigate me. I didn't show up for your operations and there is no factual evidence. Zhao Wuji and Wan Lingquan can't do anything to me. Dad. Good brother. Big Brother. Let's evacuate! I have searched through Eighty-One Sect's counterfeit products and found nothing. Then search the entire city. Check the Prefect of Jiang City's residence too. It's best if we find evidence to take down Bai Hongming. Bai Hongming is a Prefect after all, we'd better be careful. I know you have a good relationship with him. But at a critical time, we should be swift in our killing. I heard that Bai Hongming's daughter was also involved in this matter. Use this as an excuse to search them. Why are you still standing around? Go! Yes! Brother Zhao, what does this mean? The reward for capturing Ji Yinqiu and Su Can is 100 silve taels. Search! Who dares to? Do you think you can search the Prefect of Jiang City's residence? This is by Lord Zhao's order to capture the court's criminals. Search! I heard your daughter Baiwei was involved. You scum. You're adapting quick to your new role as a traitor. I was so blind to have sworn brotherhood with you. Eliminate violence and secure livelihood bring relief to the world. We don't ask to be born on the same day, month, and year, but ask to die on the same day, month, and year. I know I've done something wrong against you. From now on, I won't be merciful anymore! Master Zhao, no evidence was found in Bai's residence. What should we do next? In that case, we are in no hurry. There will always be a bargaining chip that falls onto my hand. Father, seeing you and Uncle Wan have a lot to do, I would like to ask father to marry Chunxiao to me. Brother Wan, what do you think about making our relationship even closer? Uncle Wan, do not worry. Chunxiao and I are both willing and in love, I will take good care of her. In that case, I can't stop them. Good, good. Brother Wan, you're a hero indeed. Let's arrange for them to get married as soon as possible. I will head back and make necessary arrangements. I'll take my heave. Kun, send off your future father-in-law. Uncle Wan, please. Chunxiao. Don't worry. Marrying Zhao Kun is marring our level. Just be a young rich missus at peace. How many people dream of this? Dad! I don't like Zhao Kun at all. Also, he has twisted values and does bad things. He's a fake gentleman! He's a rich young master after all. This is inevitable. This is nothing. Anyway, no matter what you say, I will not get married to him. I also already have someone I like. But I heard from Zhao Kun that the two of you had been in love for a long time. Who do you like then? You know him. His name is Su Can. What? That beggar? He's also a court criminal! You better give up! This is not up to you. I have already agreed in your place. In two days, the Zhao residence will be bringing the dowry. Dad! I will only get married to Su Can! I will... Protect you forever. Can... Where have you been? What should I do? How dare you cheat on me! It hasn't been seven months since I married you and you've given birth! If it weren't for the fact that your father is high and mighty in the court now, I would have hit you to death long ago! Scram! I see you've been odd all this while. Are you still thinking about that beggar Su Can? Is this bastard his? I'm going to kill him now! No! Go away! Running away? Your father will send you back within two days anyway. I didn't hurt you, did I? Let's take a break before starting again. My greatest wish is that there is someone who can spend free time watching the dawn with me, and have meals with me. I will... Protect you forever Stop thinking about her. She is married. You are people of two worlds. Why be so persistant? I will wish her happiness. It's best you can think that way. It's just that who knows when you can start appreciating the people right in front of you. Chunxiao, it's normal that couples fight. Don't be so willful. Dad, you have no idea, Zhao Kun is a bastard. But you can't stay here and not go back. Zhao's residence has sent someone to pick you up. Get ready. I will never go back. All right, young lady. Stop being willful. I order you to go with them. Dad. Are you driving me away? I'm not driving you away. You family of three should reunite. Fine. I will go. You... You're not wishing your father to be well, are you? Smoky haze above the horizon, the thousand miles greets. I am at ease, the birds are chirping together. Clear landscape, the flora is vibrant. Spring comes and winter goes, life and death. Flowers and leaves, make their way down. Dad, the candied hawthorns are so delicious. Good girl. Hey brother, look at that young lady. Whose lady is this? She's so beautiful. Let's go. Young lady, where are you going? Excuse me. What are you doing? She's being feisty. I like it. Get out of the way! You like many things, don't you. Would you like it if I stab you twice? Fatty, this has nothing to do with you. Move aside. You bastard! Stop babbling! Scram! Brother, I heard he's very skillful at killing pigs. Let's go. Don't run if you dare. You're nothing. Lady Wan, are you okay? I'm fine. Thank you Fatty. You're welcome. This child is... Oh right, Fatty. May I ask where Su Can is? Since the last time we teased Zhao Kun he left with the people of Eighty-One Sect. He hasn't sent me any news either. C-could this kid be Can's? Yes. I'm homeless now. I just want to find Su Can as soon as possible to entrust the child to him. Sister-in-law, why not stay at my place for now? I take care of you and your child. We can wait for Can together. [Five Years Later] Stop running! Where is he? Chase! - I heard the county government got robbed yesterday. - Really? I wonder how much County Magistrate Wang had taken from the people normally, he engaged in embezzlement and bribery, oppressed the people, and only does evil. He deserves it! This black and white hero has become very famous in Jianghu lately. There have been more than a dozen robberies to help the poor. Many corrupt officials have restrained a lot. They're afraid they'd be the next target. This black and white hero saves the suffering, robbing the rich to help the poor, what a hero. - Yes. - Exactly. Candied hawthorns. How does braised pork tonight sound? Sure! Sir, give me a candied hawthorn. Here, Xiaofeng. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Pay the protection fee! - Oh, what the. I will kill you if you don't pay protection fee. Who dares not to pay protection fees? These bastards... Boss, it's that fatty who refused to pay up the protection fee. That's because he hasn't see who I am. Don't be afraid, Xiaofeng. - It's him? - Yes. What's your name? W-why do you care? He's pretty rude, isn't he? Tell you what? I will protect you in this area. Just pay up the protection fee. Are you paying or not? I'll ask you again. Are you paying or not? Are you paying or not? Come to me, young boy. Yes, be good. It's okay, it's okay. What are you doing standing around? Go beat him up. Uncle Fatty! Don't hit Uncle Fatty! Uncle Fatty! Don't hit Uncle Fatty! Enough. Don't cry. Who else? You. You. Listen up. If you don't pay up the protection fee, this will what happens to you. Don't move! Let's go. Uncle Fatty, are you okay? I haven't been back in six years. Not much has changed in Jiang City. This is a mess. People are suffering. What change can there be? Sorry. Don't be afraid. What a cute boy. Take it. Walk slowly. You're not blaming me? Do we look like bad guys? Rich adults are pretty fierce. We aren't. Take your thing and go home. These people who bully the good and fear the evil even bully kids now. This is the protection fee collected recently. Please pass it along to Master Zhao. How's the investigation going with the Black and White Hero? I'm already investigating. Just give me a little more time. Chop him! You're courting death, right? My knife is freshly sharpened. It's very sharp! Let's go with the rules of the Jianghu. One-on-one! Come down. Bastard, you're not following the rules. Fatty, you're so bold! You dare to come into my Axe gang. Are you courting death? Chop him up! Excuse me! Let's go. Charge! Brother, are you all right? Fatty? Can! You left without a single word! Not even a letter! Do you even treat me as a brother? You've changed a lot over the years. You're a hero now. Are you okay? I'm fine. So you are the black and white heroes. I didn't expect to meet you here. That's right. Let's stop talking, there's someone important waiting for you. Let's go. Xiaofeng, I'm back. Mother, Uncle Fatty is back. All right. It's you! Can, you've met him? Xiaofeng, call him dad. My son? Can. Look. Chunxiao. Can, you're finally back. Mother, don't cry. Mother, Uncle Fatty said he was my father. He is your father. Come on, call him dad. Dad, why don't you want us? Dad is back. I will never leave you again. Why am I so unimportant. What are you panicking about? The black and white heroes just invaded the Axe Gang. I recognized right away that the one one in black is the Su Can you're looking for. Where are they now? They're at Fatty's place. What about Su Can? Martial Sage, we were too late when we got there. They have escaped. Useless scum@ Have you found a pure Yin body? No clue yet. I have put out a bounty but haven't gotten any news. The highest cultivation of Jiu Yang Xiao Yao You can only be achieved by combining with a pure Yin body. Be sure to find it as soon as possible. - Yes. - Yes. Chunxiao. You've suffered. Everything is worth it, to be able to see you again. How have you been? I'm the one who should be sorry. Chunxiao. I still owe you a third wish. It's been so many years, you still remember? I thought of my third wish. I just hope our family can live together in the future. I... Just came to deliver some food. She is a good girl. Chunxiao. I am satisfied with just you. Just got the message. The disaster relief appropriated by the court is solely responsible by Third Brother, Bai Hongming. Officials at all levels are holding a grudge. Jiang City Guard Zhao Wuji colluded with the gangs to get rid of Third Brother. We have to send someone to protect him. Wei, thank you for your timely notification. I've been waiting for you for a long time. Boss, there are so many people. What do we do? You came just in time. I'm going to kill everyone today. Go! I know everything. I tell you everything. Master Zhao sent us here. He gave me 200 gold taels. I've told you everything. Please don't kill me. We still have to find Martial Sage for help. The black and white warriors that Martial Sage is looking for is Su Can and Bai Hongming's daughter Bai Wei. Bai Wei is a pure Yin body. A pure Yin body? Martial Sage is very interested in this. They're at Bai's residence now. This is a good chance to capture them all. - Go and tell Martial Sage. - Yes. Let's go now. Yes! It's an emergency. Let's come up with a surefire plan. Go! You are Bai Wei? Can! Are you okay? Master! Brothers, charge! Charge! It's time to pledge my allegiance! Kill them all! My life is up to me. Not up to you. Dad! Kun! Kun, don't go! Kun. I fought for power and seized the wealth of the world, but what's the use? Kun. Kun! Three flowers gather on the top, the Yin and Yang become one. With the formula, the road is paved. How... Did you practice the tenth chapter of Xiao Yao You? It's responsibility and love. Responsibility... And love? Now the world is in chaos, the court is in decline, Zhao Wuji and Wan Lingquan have been captured by the government. I intend to recommend you as an official to eliminate violence and secure livelihood. Thank you for your kindness. I have no intention of joining the Jianghu's entanglement and court's affairs. I just ask for you to keep Chief Ji safe. I have decided to refrain from entertainment for three years. If there's anything important for the country and people, I will not refuse. The court has awarded a thousand silver taels. Please accept it. No need. There have been many disasters these few years. Please distribute them to those who need it for me. [Ten years later] Get out of the way! Hoho? Where are you going? - Whose lady is this? - Help! - So pretty. - Don't come near me! Help! Where are you going? Help! Boss, boss! Chop her up! Yes! Chop her up! Go away! Tell me your name if you dare! I will not coward away from hiding the weak and poor! I will never change my name. My name is Wan Xiaofeng!
