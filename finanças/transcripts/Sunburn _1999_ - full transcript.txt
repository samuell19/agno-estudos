[dog barking] [laughter] Ms. Maggie, can I have a word, please? -I got it. -Got what? The money. Where are we going to go? -I changed my mind. -What? I have. I'm keeping it. -Don't mess. -I'm not. -You can't. -The fuck, yeah I can. -No, you can't. -Davin, I can, and I am. It's my baby. You've gone mad, have you? Your dad would crucify me. Not if we're married. Maybe we should talk about this later once you've had time to think. I don't need time to think. We're not getting married. I hardly know you, for fuck's sake. That's what the honeymoon's for, love. What are you making a face for? This suit's too big on me. Nonsense. You look handsome. I don't think anybody else would be wearing one. Oh, never mind that, you're my son. And I'm not sending you off to American looking like a ruffian. You want to make a good impression now, don't you? -Ma. -What? I'd like to stop in here for second. What for? I want to say goodbye to my friends. Ah, hurry up then. Here. [gunshots] [screams] -Hey. -Hey, Robert. I'm off to America in two days. Will you reload? I'll be gone 'till September. You have to shoot them in the head. It's not working. See yas. -Where are you going, Davin? -Nowhere. Go back to bed. -Can I come with you? -No, I'm not going anywhere. Raymond's going to kill you. You're taking his bike? Oh, he's really going to kill you. He's going to cream you. Alright, you didn't see me leave, right? Good man. Can I have your Adidas? -My Adidas? -Yeah. They're loads too big for you. I'll grow. -You sure you will? -Yeah, I will. What if you turn out to be a midget, or something? -Fuck off. -Alright. See you, Casper. Bye, Davin.

Welcome to the work and travel program of the United States of America. For over 20 years, this program has allowed thousands of Irish students the opportunity to gain insight into the life and culture of the US. One of the most popular destinations is Montauk, Long Island. Montauk is a wonderful summer resort, and one that offers a wealth of opportunities to the visiting Irish students. And your visa gives you the freedom of working more than one job if you wish. Plenty of our students decide to be chamber maids in the morning, then have the afternoons free. And at night, well, why don't you try getting a waiter's job at one of the many fine restaurants in Montauk? -This one. -No. I'm not paying 800 dollars to sleep on the floor. You don't have to, we can pull in extra mattresses. We're going to be like sardines in there. It could be like that everywhere. Believe me, I've called around. Ah, fuck it. I suppose we'll hardly be there anyways, between work and the beach. That's right. We'll be working on that savage tan, eh? But whatever you choose, you can be sure that this is going to be best summer you've ever had. [Robert] Hey. Hey. I know you. You're Davin McDerby. It's me, Robert Fisk. Oh, yeah. Funny meeting someone from home over here. I hear they have the best jobs on the commercial fishing boat. I'm going straight there down to the docks, and seeing about getting a job. You can make up to 1500 dollars in one month. -Fuck off. -It's true. A boy named Francis, his older brother. He came back last summer with 2,000 dollars. He bought a brand new set of MacGregor golf clubs. Brand new. What kind of boat was he on? -A fishing boat. -Yeah, but what kind? -What was he catching? -Fish. [snorts] Jesus, you know a fuck lot about fishing. [boy] Hey, look at the surfer. [excited chatter] [tropical music] [chatter] [car horn] -Hi. -Aideen Higgins? Yeah, that's me. How many can you fit? Well, seven is the legal limit. Oh, but we're nine. -Get in. -Great. [Davin] A new boat. A bit small. We're used to working for it. [fisherman] What were you after? Well, it was a couple of years ago, but it was um, a haddock in herring. And cod, of course. -Marlin. -Marlin. It's not a coat and tie job. I know. I left my gear back in town. We're going now so make up your mind. Let's go, boys. The dispatcher is everything to a cab cop. It's the nerve center. The heart and soul, if you like. How's the pay? It's better than the average waitress job. Alright, I'll take it. Hold on a wee minute there. It's a 14-16 hour day. You're going to be so busy, you're not even going to have time to pee, let alone hang out with your mates. I do a bit of decorating. -[boat engine revs] -Hand on the bow. It's just two weeks, peachy. I'll be back before you know it. -[woman] Please be careful. -Two weeks? Yo, fancy pants. Put these in the back. [seagulls] Davin. Good luck, Robert. [laughs] ♪ Keep it real ♪ ♪ Keep it real ♪ [cheering] [whistling] You're getting creamed. You know that guy I was telling you about? -Yeah. -That's him just walking in. Billy Conlin. He knows about getting around immigration. Oh, really? What do I do? I'll introduce you later. Keep your hands up, slugger. Keep your hands up. Davin! [punch lands] [crowd cheers] Come on, Davin. Put your hands up, Davin. Here. Try this. Thanks. You with Billy? I work with him if that's what you mean. Oh, yeah? What's he do then? Dispatcher, you know. Pinch in cabs. Oh, really? I recognize your voice then. -You do? -Yeah, Aideen. -Queen of the airways. -Get off. Good to know. What? You sound tired on the radio. -Shut up, will you? -Hey, Aideen. How's it going? That's attractive. -Thank you. -What's your name? -I'm Davin. -Davin. This is Veronica, my roommate. -Charmed. -Alright. -Aideen. -Hey, Billy. What up, Rocky? How's the floor? Is it stopping? Ah, yeah, You're good. -Veronica, whoa! Nice dress. -You like it? Delicious. Like caramel candy. Actually that would make a very good uniform. -Would it? -Yeah. Anyway you think. A little pinch right there. Ah, cheers. Nice one. It'd be brilliant. Hey, Davin. Come on, we'll go for a chat. Alright. -Good luck. -See ya. You think Billy needs another dispatcher? No, I don't think so. Shame, isn't it? Yeah. There's no changing your mind. Once you do this, you can't go back. I'm not going to change my mind. I consider this a long term goal. Alright, look. I've got some friends in New York. They'll be able to help you. I'll get you started. Hey, great. What's your family going to say if you don't come back? They don't fucking care, to be honest. Alright. Think on it a week, okay? But keep it to yourself. We don't want to give the INS any reason to do their job. Alright. How's your girls? Like shit. Welcome to America, kid. [fisherman] We're on it. The continental shelf, the great abyss. No offense, Robert, but I'm surprised they got you on the helm for this shit. Are you okay with it? Yeah, I suppose. You're one cool customer, mick. I keep telling Smitty I don't think it's worth it. You veer just two degrees off that shelf, and boom, you'll drop like a load of led. Take the boat down like a little toy. I don't care how rich the fish stock is out here. I don't breathe water. What's our bearing? Three hundred and forty two, forty one. What? What? We're heading off that cliff. Forward, forward, forward, I say. Okay, you keep it right there. I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm going to go down and check the lines. I feel sick. Hey, buddy. You should probably be wearing one of these. We're counting on you. [laughing] [waves] [boat creaking] Yeah, sharp housework. Cheers, 'kay. Eldo. Eldo? Fuck. Billy, this pedal is sticking again. [Eldo] Watch your language, Aideen. Sorry, Eldo. That party on south side just got shut down. Hold on, hold on. Darcy and his roommates are having one. It's at the house behind the mobile station on Bayberry. What'd you do? Sorry. I just got a little distracted. [phone rings] -Pink Tuna. -Hey, sweetie. Hi Veronica. Where to? Riverhead, where else? More shopping? Jesus, hold on. Uh, haven't any drivers at the moment, Vi. Can you wait? -No. -I'll take her. When's that going to get done then? It's done. Billy will be over in 10. -Billy? -Yeah, see you. Well, I'll see you, fellas. Thanks for everything. You take care of yourself. [laughs] What's that? It's kelp straight from Georges Bank. And I'm not taking less than 350 a pound for it. Is it fresh? It's just off the boat. Are you Donna Lee? Yeah, that's right. What do you think, Terry? It's seaweed. Not seaweed, kelp. The kind the Japanese eat. What's your name, pal? I'm Robert Fisk. Robert, I know the guys on the Donna Lee. They're pulling your leg. Don't worry. It's not the first time. If you happen to have some barnacles, I might be interested. Hey! Wait. I'll buy that seaweed. -What for? -For my garden fertilizer. Is 20 dollars okay? Here, you can have it. No, no. 20 dollars. Can you deliver it? Yeah, alright. Okay. I'll write down my address. [door closes] Ahoy there! What'd you catch? Moving it on then? Yeah, thanks for the desert. Two straight weeks out in the water. Wasn't exactly what we came here for. What are we looking for? -Thirteen. -That's my room. You're going to be my roommate then? -Yeah, I suppose. -Great. Just here. Wait, did you tell anyone back home I was here? No. Well, because it's kind of important that you don't. -Why? -It's a long story. I'll tell you about it later, alright? Just don't tell anyone I was here. -Alright. -Good man. Usually looks a bit better than this. Big fat fucking winkler made a mess of things last night. Pay your rent McDerby. Excuse me, who just found us a new roommate? Hi. Is that seaweed? Ask him what it's for. -Fertilizer. -Fertilizer. Fertilizer? -Why seaweed? -What's your name? -Robert Fisk. -Robert Fisk.

You like "sex on the beach?" That's original. What's in it anyway? Loads of things. It's lethal. Alright, just the one. Can't have just the one. It's two for one night. Some of us have to work, you know. So, you're not planning to go back home then. Sorry? Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me, but how come? Ireland is not a place for people with aspirations. Ha, what are your aspirations? Um, the pursuit of happiness. Best of luck. Speaking of pursuits, did you shag Billy yet? Shut up. I just want to know. None of your business. I just couldn't help wondering what was behind all those long hours, you know? I have to send money back to my mom. Plus, pay off the travel loan. And I want to save a bit. -What for? -The future. So you want to spend your one and only soul in America saving for your retirement? I have my fun. Now, here's my roommate. Let's see if we can get us a drink out of the old chiseler. -You're dressed like a girl. -Yeah, what do you think? Robert Fisk. Are you the one with the seaweed? Not anymore. I sold it. Then what's with the paint? That's for my new job. Where are you working now? With the woman that bought the seaweed. You're joking. You're really milking this one, aren't you? Thanks. I'm off. -Nice meeting you, Robert. -Yeah, it was nice to meet you. See you, Davin. Yeah, say hi to Billy for me, will you? Fuck off. -She's nice. -Yeah. Hey, what are you? The play boy of the western world now? Hey, Cormick. Another round. -Robert's buying. -No, I'm not. Alright, I'll buy another round. No, I don't want a round. For fuck sake, is there a special out here for boring people? Come on, Robert. We're in America, let's celebrate. Let's show them what we're all about. Cormick, another two. Fuck, it's getting heavy. But a day is a day though, right? I didn't say carry it all the way. Yeah, you did. Look here. Do you play golf, Davin? It's a real true test. You're up against yourself. You've got nobody else to beat. I'm not that good. Davin, me paint! I'm sorry. Let gravity take a turn, will you? Robert. [knocks] Hi, Robert. I'm sorry I'm late. I had an accident with that paint. It burst open. It may have been loose. The lid. We should go back to the store. It's their fault. I don't know why you-- I did kind of drop it. Oh. I went by the store this morning, but it was closed. Look, I was about to run down to the beach for a quick swim. Why don't you come with me? -Swim? -Might make you feel better. Let me see if there is a suit for you. Come in. [chuckles] [waves rolling] Is it alright with the waves? It's great with the waves. Come on, you'll love it. [Aideen] So what is she like? Is she sexy? -Do you fancy her? -No. What? Not at all? No. Is he blushing, Eldo? He sure is. I don't think I have to put up with this. I'm a paying customer. I have a right to my privacy. Ha! -He fancies her. -Oh, yeah. Definitely. Yep. [Davin] I know drink comb. Go on, ask me anything. [Cormick] Give it a rest will you, Davin? [phone rings] I would be great at bartending. No. Hello? I'm calling from Ireland for Davin. Hold on. It's for you. I know every drink. Personality, talk to the customers. It's from Ireland. Hello? Didn't think I'd find you, did you? Who's this? Not sure. It's only the mother of your fucking child. Margaret, how are you? I'm in the jacks every morning puking my guts out, thank you very much. -How are you? -Grand. Well, isn't that nice. I hear it's gorgeous where you are. Yeah, um. What's up, Cormick. -Davin, are you still there? -Yeah. So, Davin, if I didn't know you loved me so much, I'd think you were pulling a legger. No, it's not like that, Margaret. What's it like then? Geez, Davin. The least you could do is offer me money. -Alright. -Four hundred pounds. Jesus, Margaret. Hey, sorry, listen. Here's a list of some people in New York, right? Just call when you're ready, okay? Great. You alright? Okay, good. I'll see you later, alright? [giggling] [calming music] Is um, a Robert Fisk working here? Yeah, come on in. -She's gorgeous. -Shut up. What did you come out here for? Did you tell anyone back home I was here? -Did you? -No. I need to borrow some money. -How much? -Whatever you can manage. I need about 400 pounds. Jesus, Davin. Look, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important, Robert. What's this all about? You can't tell anyone. I got a girl in trouble back home. -Who? -Never mind who. -Pregnant. -Yeah, pregnant. What do you think? Was it Ginger Conway? Fuck off, she's a kill. -Give us a hint. -No. -Do I know her? -No. -Look, I can here for help, not 20 fucking questions. Would you like a drink, Davin? Oh, no. I'm grand, thanks. Yeah. It's very kind of you, Robert. So when will she get that? -This afternoon. -Oh, great. Thanks. What's this? Davin McDerby sending money home? Always thought your money went to the pursuit of happiness. Oh, yeah. Always trying to give back to the poor bastards back in Ireland, you know? I've already guessed it, Davin. Well, you keep that under your hat. I have me reputation to uphold. Do you really? -Good luck. -See you. -Hi. -Hi, how are you doing? [motorcycle engine] [Fiona] McDerby residence. Can I speak to Casper, please? It's Davin. Hi Davin. -Fiona. -It's about time you called. Could you just put Casper on, Raymond? What happened that night? Did she tell you she was on the pill? That's none of your business. Yeah, well, unfortunately, it is. I had to pay off that little tyrant 300 pounds. -You what? -That's right. So now you have to come back, which is a shame, because we all got used to you not being here. Just put Casper on, you fucking blowhard. Listen, Davin. The party's over. I've already booked you on a flight. You have a week to say your goodbyes, and get yourself together. I'm not coming back, Raymond. -Hello, Davin. -Casper? Get off the fucking phone, Casper. You get off the fucking phone, Raymond. Bye, Davin. Casper? Have you already weighed that money I just gave you? No. I just want it back, I changed my mind. Okay. Good man. [chatter] -Is Billy there? -No, he's driving. What's the story on him and Veronica? You don't have to protect him, Aideen. [phone rings] Pink Tuna. Oh, hello, Mrs. Barters. Yeah, I'm just putting in the last stitches now. Red? No. No, I wouldn't say it's too red. Well, actually, today might not be so good. I need to talk to you. I'll tell you what. Why don't I call you when it's ready? How's that? -[phone rings] -Hold on. Pink Tuna. Yeah, okay. About 10 minutes. Billy, I got three at the station for you to go to Harren pond. That's not on my way. It is if you take Mietenhaus. Mrs. Barters. What the fuck? She hung up. She gave it to me. Who? Carolyn, the women I'm working for. Lucky you. Yeah, but I don't know what to do. What do you mean? She's my boss. It's not proper, is it? Yeah, so she fancies you. No. Do you think? What? She bought you cover alls, did she? Covering not much at all, that's what these are. She does fancy you, Robert. You should by fucking thankful. She's old. She was married. I don't even know if she's divorced yet. That's strange, isn't it? What's strange? Well, I'm only 21. Well, do you fancy her? I'm talking about the age difference here. Suppose I did... Well, it just doesn't seem proper. What would people think? Suppose my mom found out. [woman] Exactly how old is she, Robert? [Eldo] If she ain't old at all, I'd do her in a heartbeat. [woman] Shut up, Eldo, you pervert. [Eldo] Does she have all her teeth, Robert? -They heard everything. -The pedal got stuck. Robert, come back.

The truth is it's a pretty practical investment. How much money do you spend on cabs? How much time do you waste hitchhiking? And another thing. That is now your car. She is a classic. You following? So if I put a little work into it, resell it for loads more than I paid for it. I already paid for it. Loads more than you paid for it. I'll double your money. -Come on.

If it's not, please call me, or have your lawyer call me. It will probably save us time, i.e. money if we got together, or at least talked on the phone beforehand. Of course you probably wouldn't want to do that. One more thing, I'd really like to get one weekend at the house before the summer's over. I don't think that's too much to ask. Alright? Bye.

Having someone care about you like that, you know? She's a real bed bug and all, you know what I mean? Careful you don't have a heart attack. -Oh, Aideen. -What? If you happen to see Veronica, don't mention to her what I just said. [music] -Hi, is Billy here. -No. -Where is he? -He's in his cab. -He's not coming in? -He's working. Is he angry with me? Just what is it with you two? I'm not your fucking marriage counselor, alright? [chatter] Cheers, lads. Hey, Aideen. Hey, chins. Move over there. Fuck off. I've been waiting here 20 minutes. It's alright, Davin. Picnic tables outside. -What? -Outside. Two minutes on the patio. Scoot. Oh, geez, Davin. [music] [chatting] What is it? It's a farm cutter. It's supposed to make you see better. I don't want to look at you that good now. You think she's attractive? Veronica? Yeah. In an obvious 'please fuck me' kind of way. Here. Now you have it. When do you go back to work? -I'm not going back to work. -You serious? I'm not working my ass off so he can run around with that slapper. Bit right. My own fucking roommate. After your own boss. That's shocking, really. -I don't know what I saw in him. -Neither do I. You're far too good for him. -I'm an idiot. -You're grand. You know, you just need to get out more. Jesus, can you make more? Sure can. Talk to me. The test showed... There's more than two men I can't pick. We have to operate again. Who'd believe it? I mean really, who'd believe it? What's wrong? What's the matter? I don't know. It's just... He's dying. Sorry, I'm not usually like this. [on TV] Can't you talk to your friend? It's embarrassing. It's okay.

I'd have gotten it to you sooner, but I didn't keep the forwarding address. Which ones are these? Those are the air bags. -The what? -The air bags. Cushion in the sole, give you the extra spring in your step. Oh, I'll walk around a little bit more. Knock yourself out, love. -Hey, Davin. -How are you doing? -Alright. And you? -Grand. -You sell trainers? -Yeah. Need a pair? No. -Here. -What's that? That's the first payment on the loan. I don't need it now. Well, I have it now, so you better take it. Listen, I'm sorry about you getting kicked out. Wasn't your fault. -Have a seat if you like. -Alright. Cheers. -How's Carolyne? -Fine. What? Oh, you doob. Did you? -I don't believe it. -What? You know what. Shut up, will you? Do the ones I'm wearing come in this color? No. Well, you better be getting back. Carolyne is going away for the weekend if you want to come out for a swim. You're not living there, are you? Well, no, but I'm working there all weekend. I just thought it'd be alright if a friend came over for a swim. Alright, yeah. Well, I'm pretty busy at work myself, but I'll twinkle my own. Davin, it's my birthday Saturday. Alright. Well, I'll pop up. Alright, Davin. Feel free. Okay, good luck. Congratulations. I know what we need. Do you have any black? What do you want black for? Make some smoke come out of that smoke stacker. -Here's your smoke. -Fucking bollocks. I've been working hard on that. -Stop fucking with the cake. -It's definitely strange. Reminds me of an alien. Alien, right? You know what that is? That's my son, alright? -Thought of a name for it? -Maybe son of a moron. [laughing] Thanks for all the advice, lads. You can always be really helpful. -I really appreciate it. -Oh, dry your eyes, Davin. Listen, I'm older than you, right? Been there, seen it, bought the t-shirt, all that shite. My advice to you is get as far away from this woman as you possibly can. -Amen. -He's right. You back home, you're a dead man. You can always get a job at the missionaries. They're always looking for people, Davin. I don't think you would be so entertained if you were in my position. No, that's right. I wouldn't be laughing, I'd be crying. You actually taught me something. Can we just go back and concentrate on the fucking cake, please? We're working on it. -What the fuck is that? -I'm not finished. Why're you're putting a penis on the cake? Because it's Robert's penis, you know? Nice, I like it. Yeah. A little ding dong for frisky Fisk. [chatter] [beach music] I tell you. You just got to keep your arms back like this. I couldn't. The sand kept coming up. No, like this, right? Then arch your back. Just plane there on the wave. I would have lost me face if I did that. No, you just need to get used to it. Look. Like this. [all] Happy Birthday!

Where Robert's working. I wonder if this old lady will be there. Nah, she's gone off to New York for the weekend. -It's going to be a zoo. -Davin said he only invited ten or fifteen people. He needs at least 50. Come on, we might as well walk. Yeah, the cab's not coming. I'm going to kill Billy. No, there's no beer, but I have this, though. You shouldn't be in there. Do you mind, Robert? I'm not messing, get out of there. Yeah, yeah, shut the door. Get the cups. What are you doing? Come on, Robert. Go on, will you? Robert. You've done quite well for yourself, Robert, haven't you? Robert, is this her? -Yeah. -Which one is she? I'm just teasing you. She's gorgeous, Robert. So, tell us, Robert. Is it love? -I don't know. -Look at you. He's in love. You're going to help clean this mess up. Of course I will. Will you lighten up, man? It's your birthday. Did you know this fellow made over 2000 dollars on a fishing boat this summer? Is that true? Two thousand. We're from the same neighborhood back home. [engine] [laughter] Do you have an opener? This is fucking useless. [music stops] [people chatter] Robert. Police? 42 South Parker Lane. Several kids are trespassing in my house. They're having a party. Good. The police are on their way. Anyone still here when they arrive will be arrested. I'll clean this all up. Carolyne. Just let me explain, Carolyne. Happy Birthday, Robert. -Fuck off. -Come on, man. [cars drive off. [heavy rain] Just go soft, soft! Fucking hell, man. Is that Aideen? [Davin] Let's not talk about the party. [girl] Carolyne ruined the party. She called the police. Fucking place cleared like it was on fire. How many people were there? Loads. It was packed. Told Robert she'd have him arrested. Fucking hell. Where is he now? I tried to give him a lift. -So where is he? -He must have left. Let's get out of here before the cops come. No, we're going back. We've got to find him. What are you talking about? He could be anywhere. And I can't take all of you. [all] Yes, you can. [chatter] -That was Robert. -Where? -We just passed him. -Are you sure? Yes, come on, turn around! -Alright, alright. -Turn around, Davin. Alright, give me a fucking chance, will you? [Aideen] Robert, come on, jump in. Come on, love. You'll catch a death out there. Come on, Davin. We're sorry about what happened, Robert. We all are. We're not leaving until you get in. Few scoops, it'll be grand, Robert. Pull yourself through. [bang] [screams] How was I to know she was going to come back? I'm not a fucking psychic. You let it get out of control. You told too many people. -It was a party, Aideen. -Yes, for you? Oh, fuck off. We had fun. Come on. Yeah, well, he's not having any fun now, is he? Yeah, that's not my fault. Oh, no, it's never your fault, is it, Davin? No, actually, it's always my fault. That's the story of my life. Look, Aideen. He could have stopped it anytime he wanted and he didn't. He's not the type to stick up for himself like that. Well, he's got to take responsibility for that then. What? Like you're taking responsibility for that baby? That's not the same thing. It's exactly the same thing. You know, there might be more to that story than you get in that fucking fax machine. Yeah, well, how would I know, Davin? You haven't told me, did you? I'm going to bed. Aideen. Fuck off, will you? You'll wake Gillian. Can I sleep over maybe on the floor, or something? No. I can't stay in my car. It's like a fucking sponge. Come on. Where am I going to go? I don't know. I was going to tell you about the baby. I was, it's just-- It's just the more time passed, I had forgotten, and I didn't want to tell you anymore. Look, it was just one of those things, you know? It just happened. A one night stand. She's no childhood sweetheart. We both decided we weren't going to have it, and I was going to pay for it and all, but then she started talking about marriage. She left me no choice. What do you mean she left you no choice? Well, I wasn't going to end my life just so she could have a baby. Davin, it's your baby. You're having the baby, same as her. You've got to go back. No, what I have to do is put as much distance between me and her as possible. Jesus, Davin. Don't you see a pattern here? Yeah, I see a pattern. I want to fucking break that pattern. For five years, Aideen, I've been trying to leave that place. And finally, I did. I'm not going back, no way. -So that's it. -Yeah. I'm a fuck up, Aideen. I always have been. I didn't think so. Yeah, well, you're wrong. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. You don't need to do that. I'm almost done. Carolyne, I feel terrible. I do. I didn't plan this. I told this one person that he could come over, and he told all these other people. What's that? It's what I owe you for the last two weeks. -Carolyne. -Take it. I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault. I gave you keys to my house. Carolyne. There's really nothing to say. I feel bad about it. It was a mistake for us to get involved. It's not a mistake. It's a good thing, it is. It's the best thing that's ever happened to me. -I'm sorry. -Carolyne, please. [calming music] Davin, wake up. -What? -I need some money for food. [phone rings] -Hello? -Is Aideen there, please? -Davin? -Veronica. Well, well, you surfaced at last. Yeah, is Aideen there? She's gone back. -What? -She left three days ago. You blew it, Davin. She was keen on you. I mean, you were such opposites-- You're getting burned, man. Are you flying back today? So I don't have anything to say about you and Carolyne. I know I fucked it up for you. I didn't mean to. I really didn't. I just wanted to tell you that before you went back. Here, I have the rest of the money for you. -Where have you been? -New York. Not going back home then? Nope. I don't want to back either. You're going to need some managing for that. I don't care. Did you ever get to go golfing? No. Have you even talked to her since? No. -Not at all? -No. It's over. I mean, I suppose it's bound to end, you know? Sooner or later. I was hoping to stay. [Davin] How about your family? Would you miss them? I would sure, but not as much as I would miss her. I'm shocked, Robert. I had no idea you felt so strongly about her. I love her. I don't mind saying that. She may have been the love of my life. I can't imagine finding another like her. You will, of course. You don't know that. No one knows that. Did you see Aideen before she left? I thought she was leaving today? What? Same flight as mine. She's not gone? She went away for a bit traveling, but she's back. How are you getting to the airport? Bus. I'm going that way. I can give you a lift, alright? I already got me ticket. I'm not going to charge you, Robert. Do you need money for gas, or something? No, I'd just like the company. I don't know. I already have my ticket. Just let me drive you to the fucking airport. Why? 'Cause I want to drive Aideen, and it'll go a lot smoother if you were there. Do you fancy Aideen? Look, it's the last favor I'm ever going to ask you. Just let me drive you to the airport, and when Aideen's around, act like you like me. That's platonic. I know. Well, I'm not finished packing yet. Okay. I'll wait in the car. [girls chatting] -Is that Davin? -Yeah. How did you do it? Slip him some ecstasy, or something? No, I took him golfing. Carried his gulfs for him. He was mad about that woman, you know? I really fucked that one up. So how's New York? It's great. I have a crap job, but it pays alright. The money's floundering that place. Do you want to see it? You'd like New York. -I'm sure I would. -I'm serious though. You should try it. It'd be a real life experience. -Davin. -I'm serious, though, I mean-- If I could make money, think what you could do. I mean, you've got a brain in your head. You're better than most people, Aideen. You got a job like that. There's no one holding you back in this country. There's nobody holding me back in Ireland. That's because you're different. Davin. You don't have to butter me up. I'm not holding a grudge against you. I'm not trying to butter you up. I just want you to stay. I just feel like I'm starting to get my head sorted, you know? Getting straight, and you're leaving. And I feel bad about the way things worked out for us. It could have been alright if I hadn't made a mess of things. Jesus, Davin. It's a bit late for this, isn't it? Yeah. When I saw you drive up, I thought maybe you changed your mind about going back. -Really? -Yeah. Davin, you've got to go back and work things out with this girl and her family. I mean, I'm not saying you have to marry her, there's no way they can make you do that anyway. You just got to talk to them, and figure out something everyone can live with. Geez, you've got to try, At least, for your own peace of mind. I'm going to send money back from New York. Keep that bugger happy, I swear. Then go back and tell her that. I already sold my ticket. I can loan you money. I can't, Aideen. If I go back, I'll get stuck there, I know I will. The day I left home was the happiest day of my life. [calming music] -[Aideen] Billy! -[Davin] Billy! [both] Bye! Geez, what happened? I don't know. Something's burning. [engine dies] That's not steam, that's smoke. Fuck this, I'm going to leg it. -Come on, hurry. -Yeah. Before that gas tank blows, if you please. -You going to be alright? -Yeah. See you. Good luck. Aideen. [airplane engine] Wait! Aideen!
