My dear lady, this is the list, of the beauties that my master has loved; It is a list that I compiled myself; Observe, read along with me. Observe, read along with me. He made the most unpopular discovery. that reality differs from myth in which it's never completely ended. ...but in Spain. But in Spain are already 1003. 1003. 1003. There are among these peasant girls, Maidservants, city girls, There are countesses, baronesses, Marquesses, princesses. And there are women of every class, Of every shape, of every age. Every shape, of every age... "Devoid of imagination, he is incapable of whatever invention, and this weakness constitutes his real strength." ..100 in France, in Turkey 91; but... ...but in Spain But in Spain are already 1003. 1003. What...what moves away from his time. It moves us away from him. Every shape, every age. Every shape, every age. With the blonde one he is used to to praise her for gentleness, With the brunette one her faithfulness. With the white-haired one her sweetness. When it's cold he likes her portly, In the summer he likes her slim. Of the tall one, majestic Of the tall one, majestic! If she's tiny, If she's tiny, If she's tiny... is always charming. is always charming... And the old ones he seduces for the pleasure of adding them to the list. His overriding passion are the young beginners. He doesn't care if she is rich if she's ugly, if she's pretty; if she is rich, ugly, old or pretty. As long as she has a skirt on. You know what he does. You know what he does. What a loss it was for Art that such a master hand didn't use its inborn vigour for better ends. Who surpassed him in his field? But alas, the bigger the talent the more were the aberrations in order not to conform to any principle to any rule but supposing to know everything by himself. ...One day Léonie ...thinking that she was too big to play with dolls visits them both with a basket filled with clothes and pretty pieces of stuff, to be used for other things, on which her doll was laid. "Here, my dear little sisters" she said. "Choose whatever you like". Céline put out her hand, and took a woollen ball she liked. After a moment of thinking, I put out my hand too, saying: "I choose everything". This childish incident was a forecast of my whole life. Later on, when the way of perfection was opened out before me I realized that in order to become a Saint one must suffer very much to always seek that which is perfect, and forget oneself. I understood that there are many degrees of perfection and that everyone is free to respond to the calls of Our Lord. To do little or much for Him. To choose amongst the sacrifices He asks. And then, as in the days of my first childhood, I cried out: "My God," "I choose everything". "I will not be a Saint by halves". "I am not afraid of suffering for You". "I only fear one thing: to retain my own will." "Accept it, for I choose all that you will." Actually my way of showing affection sometimes was strange, as this passage, from a letter of my mother, proves: "My baby is an incredible little rogue." "She comes to caress me, whilst wishing me to die." "Oh, how I wish you would die, my dear momma". "I want you to go to Heaven, because you say... ...we must die to go there". And she wishes to die. Her father too. All my life God has pleased me, surrounding me with love. My first recollections are of loving smiles and tender caresses. ...at the same time He put much love in my little heart making it loving and emotional, therefore I loved very deeply my Father and Mother. I showed my love in a thousand little ways because I was very expressive. Give me death. Give me death. And I don't dare And I don't dare to look at you. Give me death. Give me death. And I don't dare ["the head in a silver charger" ...Salomè!!!] And I don't dare to look at you. Till they'll have wine, it will warm their heads let's prepare a great party. If in the piazza you find some girl, try to bring her here with you. try to bring her here with you. Without any control let the dance be Some a minuet, some a folia, some an allemande let them dance. My list tomorrow morning shall have at least ten new entries. You girls who trifle with love, Do not let the time pass you by! If in your breasts your hearts are fluttering, Here is the cure, as you can see! What a joy, what a joy it will be! You light-headed young men, Don't go wandering here and there. A fool's holiday is very short, But for me it has not yet begun. What a joy, what a joy it will be! Beautiful as an angel On earth as a pilgrim. Fresh as a lily that opens upon morning. Eyes that speak and laugh, glances that conquer the heart. Hair that surpasses ebony. Enchanting smile! Enchanting smile! For God's sake! Doctor! For God's sake! Doctor! Stop your ardour. Stop your ardour. Quiet down, calm down. For God's sake! Doctor! Stop your ardour. Doctor! For God's sake! A soul innocent and ingenuous That ignores itself. Modesty incomparable Goodness that makes one fall in love. To the poor piteous, Gentle, sweet, loving! Heaven made her be born To make a heart beat! A heart beat! To make a heart beat! Heaven made her be born To make a heart beat. "Oh, my Fairy." "My little Fairy." "Why did you die?" "Why... ...in.. stead... ...why... ...did... ...not... ...die... I... ...who am so bad... ...instead... ...of you... ...who are so good?" " ...to carry home one of these two jugs of water. I’ll give you a little slice of bread Then after the... ...little slice of bread... ...I’ll give you.. ...a nice dish of cauliflower... ...dressed with oil... ...and with vinegar. And after the cauliflower I'll give you a nice confetto to let you have a good taste in your mouth." "Never mind! I’ll take the jug... I’ll take the jug to your home." "You scoundrel of a puppet!" How... How did you... How did you know it?" "It is... "it is... "It is my love for you that... told me." "Do you remember? "You left me when I was a little girl and now you find me a grown woman. Such a woman I could almost be your mother!" "Oh yes, yes! I am very glad" ...for then I'll call you 'my momma' " "For so long I've been pining for having a mother, just like everybody else." ...pining for... ...for having a mother. For having a mother. Like everybody else. Yes, yes, yes! The same vo...ice. The same eyes, the same hair. Yes! You also... You also have the same turquoise hair. He is as is: calm, impassive, irresponsible. ...turquoise hair. Like you! His creatures are emancipated from any care, from lightness or from weight. They are as they are, and feel as they feel. It is the aristocratic form of pain - "Life as a puppet has grown tiresome to me - of a pain that denies pity. and I want to become a good boy like everybody else." "Like everybody else!" "Beginning tomorrow, you'll go to school." "You'll go to school!" "I get sick if I go to school." "Help me to grow up!" "But you can’t grow." "Because puppets never grow." "They are born puppets." "They live puppets" "and they die puppets." Economy of the gesture. "Are my eyes really telling me the truth?" "Are you really my own dear Pinocchio?" Parrot... A parrot! The trap caught me... ...the trap... I went back to the house of the Fairy, who was dead. And the Pigeon, seeing me crying, said to me 'I have seen your father building a little boat' 'to look for you'. And I said to him 'Oh, if I only had wings too!' And he said to me 'Do you want to go to your father?' And I said 'I wish! But who will take me there?' And he said 'I'll take you there.' And I said: ' How?' And he said: 'Get on my back'. This way we flew all night long and next morning the fishermen that were looking toward the sea said to me: "There is... " ...you will learn what that is. We will do the rest And soon you will learn what that is. We will do the rest... The dinner is already prepared. Play, my dear friends! Since I spend my money freely, I want to be amused. Leporello, serve me, quickly. 'I am ready to serve you.' Since I spend my money freely, ... ...not wanting to see anything of the villain earth. She is pre... gn... ant. S..so, mom... it happened one night. He... ...was... ...here. In the... ...big... ...armchair. So... ...then... ...he stood up... ...and... ...I had... ...the misfortune... ...of seating... ...in... ...his place. Then... ...I wanted... ...to get up... ...and... ...I... ...I.. ...I couldn't.
