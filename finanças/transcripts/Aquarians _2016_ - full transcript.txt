Well, today we'd like to welcome back Daniel Sullivan from St. Patrick's Seminary, whom Bishop Byrnes has graciously sent us to support Father Rob and our parish during this challenging time. Father? Yeah. Thank you. I have a very distinct memory of the reception after Daniel's first communion, when water started flooding out from under the bathroom door, right back there. I went in to find Jacob, Christopher and Danny, plunger in hand, all with great, guilty looks on their faces. I would never have guessed that any of those rascals would still remember the Hail Mary by the time they were old enough to drive. So, to me, this is nothing short of a miracle to have one of them return to our flock as a fellow clergyman. Who knows? Maybe he'll even back to stay. So let's give him a warm welcome. So you excited to be back then? Oh, thank you. Well, to tell you the truth, I was gonna go on a mission trip to Haiti in the spring before my ordination. So, I wasn't planning on... 10 degree weather? Where's this other Sullivan boy? Father Rob says we're lucky to have "another Sullivan boy back." Danny, Bart Sheraski. One of our biggest local job creators. Owns the river mill. Just a little family company. Nice to meet you, Mr. Sheraski. Dan's brother, Chris, lives in town. Jake is the one. Oh, Christ. Sorry. Jake. What's Jake up to? I really have no idea. Shouldn't he be here to welcome you? We don't keep in touch. Well, you've had your nose in the books though, right? The guy's working... Young Daniel tells me he hasn't seen his brother, Jake, in years. It's odd for a clergyman to be cut out from his family, isn't it? Well, I'm sure he's looking forward to seeing him again very soon. Sure, if I have time before I go back to Milwaukee. Head back. And you're not ordained yet, are you? Sorry, I thought you said that... So, Father Rob and I are hoping that once... I think she's pitching them the dream. You know, hometown hero comes back. Prodigal son, all that stuff. She's been working Sheraski for like a year. Some big endowment. I see. Do you have any idea what Jake is up to nowadays? Saw him at the bait shop a couple months ago. Haven't seen him in church in ages but if you find him, tell him I said hi. He was a good student. Both of them were. Thank you, Mr. Marx. Call me Tom. The number you have dialed has been changed, disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please hang up. Excuse me. Do you know where Father Rob's room is? Take that. Nah. Oh and just start with half. Those are pretty strong. See you later, Grandma. She's not your grandma. Oh, Danny. I thought maybe you should stick to the liturgical stuff. But if you want, I'd love to have you do more. You could do some readings. The Gospel. Then maybe after a few weeks, I'll have you do a communion service on your own. Homily and everything. Father, I'm flattered, thank you but I think I'd prefer not. What? I'm sorry, nothing. You'd prefer not? I'd prefer not to get ahead of myself, I guess. Sorry, I got. Sally has a list of the people you should visit. Try to see them on Saturdays or Sundays if you can. No problem. Why do I get a sense you don't wanna be here? Father, I don't really have people here since my folks left town. My friends grew up. And Jacob? What? You think you can just show up here for a few weeks, light some candles, dish out communion and then scoot on back to Milwaukee by Easter? Oh, Daniel. When you commit to a life in Christ, you surrender yourself to powers beyond your control. Whatever God's reasons may be, you're here now and you must accept that. Now let us pray. Our Father, Who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy Name. Oh! Danny? You look different. Thanks? Sorry, I can't believe you're still here in town. No, neither can I. I mean, I left for awhile but. Put your leg up. Look, I'm gonna finish a blowout but if you can hang, I'll give you a ride. Okay. Yeah? Okay. So that's your dream, then? Is to become a priest? And then a bishop and then the pope? Well, I want to help people overcome their spiritual burdens through Christ's teachings. That's so cool. Thanks. A right on Maple. Let me do a little detour. Where are we? Most people in this town, they have such a narrow view of what's possible. They don't really go too far. I bet you'll be bishop. Stick with it. ♪ Can't take it with you ♪ ♪ On the same street ♪ ♪ Can't take it with you ♪ This? Right now? Come on. Let's say hi. I'm gonna. I got to pee. Who brought those? He was popular. You still come here after six years? Seven. Yeah. He was my first. My horoscope told me that I was gonna receive an unexpected visitor. Me? What's your sign? When's your birthday? May 2nd. So you're Taurus the bull. Stubborn, private. But dependable, trustworthy. What's his? Scorpio. Magnetic. Unpredictable. Makes sense. Middle child. Class clown. Maniac. Yeah. And yours? Aquarius. The Water Bearer. Charming, free-willed. Contradictory. Sounds about right. I really, I missed you guys. You seen Jake? Yeah. Where? Try his place. I don't... You don't know where he lives? So you guys don't... We're different people than we used to be. No. You're just wearing different costumes. Nettleton Road. Dirt driveway. Past the rusted-out car in the ditch. Shit. Whoa. Motherfucker! Get up! Come over here, I got a present for you! I'm all set. Thanks. What the hell are you doing? You disappear on us for a year. Mom doesn't even know where you are and I got to find out where you live from Chris' ex? I disappear? I never left. You're the one who ran away, so don't come in here with your dick hanging out! I'm here for a month. Two, maybe. I'm doing stuff with the church. I'm not trying to get in your face, man. I just need you to come to mass a couple times and just talk to people. They just need to see that we're good guys and that the church is in good hands. Whatever. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. No, I get it. It's like I'm, what do you call it? I'm like a a merit badge. Family's important. I don't wanna screw this up. I'm getting ordained in May. No shit. What do you say, Sunday? See you there? Not even a little foreplay before you bend me over here, eh? Come on. Please. Maybe there's something you'd like to pray for or ask forgiveness for. Jesus Christ. Stop saying that. Man, you are completely brainwashed. I'm not brainwashed. You used to hate this shit. You even took communion home with you from mass one time and you burned it. It's because it's different when you're a kid, man. It's different when you're not a kid. Sorry I bothered you. Forget it, I'll go. Hey. Danny! Just, will you just? All right, stay, come in. Or. Take a seat. You been playing? Most days. That and Mario Kart. Yeah, won't. Hey, will you just put that down? Put it down. The strings are a little brittle. Yeah, no shit. It's freezing in here. Out of fire wood. Speaking of which, what you up to tomorrow? Cutting firewood. What the? Lumberjack style. Come on. I could probably get us a chainsaw. No chainsaws. Why? Too loud. The whole point of fire wood is so I don't have to give money to fracking and shit. What about driving? It's a necessary evil. Here we go. Nah, this shit's rotten. Up here. Hey, do you remember the time we caught a garter snake and you stabbed it to death with a screwdriver? And then you threw it into the Thompsons' yard. Shit stank. Yeah, why? Or what about the time you got in a fight on the bus with Randy Lipvak? But you were too small to beat him up, so instead, you told him you were glad his mom was dead. Yeah. You were a nasty little bastard. I remember stuff about you too. Oh yeah? Indulge me. Do you remember that time when you were like seven and Dad sent Chris to bed without any dinner and then you saved half of yours in a napkin and brought it up to him? I think the sweetest thing you ever did though was when you got the entire 5th grad class to make Valentines for people at the nursing home. I bet they were really touched. You ever go by their anymore? Oh yeah. Old chicks dig me. Well come on, tree's not gonna cut itself. Dude. There's a reason this shit is obsolete, man. They clear-cut the whole country with this. We can cut this little branch, here. Okay. Pull. Pull. Don't push, I'll pull. Fuck! Goddamn it. Well. If it isn't the future Father Sullivan. Is that Chris, uh, Jacob? Yeah. Hi, Jake. Hi, Mr. Marx. This isn't bio class, fellas. Call me Tom, all right? What's up? Do you have a chainsaw that we could barrow? Sure I do. I'll tell you what, make you a bargain. You boys come join Jeanne and I for brunch this weekend after church, you can use the chainsaw as much as you want. Sounds good to me. Jake? Sure. All right. Come on. Jake, you catch anything lately? Just a nasty case of the crabs. You know what I mean. A few northern, some perch. I hear there's some walleye biting too. Not by my spot. Where is that anyway? Good man. I left my math homework at home but Mom's not there. I need the truck. No way. I'm going off campus. I need it by fifth hour or I'm gonna get an F. Well, then you should've remembered it. Find a ride with somebody else. What? Nothing. All right, well, I got to get into town, so. Oh. So jam later? Yeah, maybe next time. So, yeah, I'll stop by or something. All right. It's been so long. Been awhile. Oh and hey, thanks for helping me out today. You know, you really handle wood like a pro. ♪ Why do you hurt me so ♪ ♪ Leaving me so all alone ♪ ♪ Why do you make me cry ♪ ♪ From you ♪ ♪ Why do you ♪ ♪ So all alone ♪ ♪ Why do you make me cry ♪ Everybody okay here? Yeah. I'm really sorry. Stay in the car, keep your hands still! You have a license and registration? Why don't you have a license? Well I don't normally drive. Oh, Daniel, that does not bode well. I went to go see Jake, like you asked. I didn't have a ride. Well you can always call me. How'd it go? Good. Anything else? Francis brought over some music selections and Father Rob's notes from the past three months. The congregational feedback forms and next week's music are on top. Please think about mass. Father Rob needs you. The impression you make is gonna count for a lot. I will do my best. Father? It's time. Oh, fudge. I need to go. Get Francis, we'll cancel mass. Water, water. No. No. Everyone's here. Daniel can do it. Daniel? Come on, Sullivan, step up. Okay. Sure, yes sir. I'll do the service, Father. There's consecrated hosts in the... Tabernacle, I know. You know today's Gospel. Mathew, chapter two. You got a homily prepared, too, kid? No, father. Well make one up. Go on, now. Okay, okay. Come on, come on, come on. My mom said you crashed Father Rob's car. Uh huh. And that you don't have a driver's license. That's right. How come you don't know how to drive? Stop talking! Focus on the service, okay? Okay, sorry. Danny, hi. We're late, let's go. Good luck. Blessings of our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father to you all. And also to you. Please be seated. Father Rob fell under the weather at the last minute, so he asked me to continue with a prayer service this morning. It is my first time, so please be gentle. "John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, "saying, 'repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near. "'This is the one of whom the prophets spoke "'when they said to straighten the pathways for the Lord.' "So the people came to him from all around "to be baptized by him at the Jordan River, "and confessed their sins. "John said" I am baptizing you with water, "'for your repentance, "'but the one who is coming after me is more powerful. "'He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit, with Fire.'" These are the words of our Lord. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. Father Rob would. I didn't really have time to. When I first took the time and read this passage on my own a couple years ago, I thought it was strange. Why would Jesus, the Son of God, go get baptized by someone else? In Mathew's Gospel, Jesus, even though he was God's son, knew that he was just a human too. So even he must seek forgiveness for his own transgressions before he could fully serve God's purpose. What a great role model, right? So let's be sure to follow his example. I want all of you, on your way out of mass this morning, to make sure and bless yourselves with the holy water in those basins on the wall and ask God for his forgiveness and his guidance before you head out of this church and back into this day that he has given you. We must continually prepare and purify ourselves to be fully received into God's grace. Body of Christ. Amen. Body of Christ. Body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. Body of Christ. Amen. Hi. Cross. Lord, bless Nicole in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Oh. "Body of Christ?" But you're. But. Whatever, dude. Peace be with you. Body of Christ. Um. Body of Christ. Amen. Hey, you missed me. Don't leave a message because I don't check my voicemail. Where the hell were you? What, I'm here. You didn't show up for the service! I looked like an idiot! Marx took off already. He said after church. It's after. What, you didn't think I was gonna... Come to my first service ever, yeah. I showed up, all right? Jesus Christ, you think I came all the way down here to be scrutinized by my old teacher over some crappy waffles? I'm just trying to help you out, bro. Why don't you be more specific next time? How'd it go? Wanna eat? I'm not hungry. Well, if you're just gonna sit on your ass and freeze, we might as well be catching fish. So the other night, I was at a bar up in Bessemer and two priests walk into the bathroom. Uh huh. So they step up to the urinals and one glances over at the other and he sees a little square patch on the other guy's pecker and he asks him, "Hey, does that thing really work?" And the other priest says, "Oh yeah, I think so. "I'm down to three butts a day." Come on. I'm sure you got better ones. Easy. How thick it it? I don't know. Let's find out. Fuck! Woo! Oh God. Regular or crispy? Crispy. Okay. Burned them anyway. There we go. Good work. Give me one of those. You've earned this. Good meat, good drink, good God, let's eat. Amen. See? I still know how to pray. So do you ever? What? Pray. No. Why not? Because I don't believe in fairytales anymore. People spend their entire lives feeling bad and trying to dig themselves out of a bottomless pit so they can fly away to some magical la la land after they die. It's bullshit. No it's not. What's wrong with treating people how they would like to be treated and teaching people not to steal and not to murder? Murder? God is the single biggest reason people murder each other. He's the biggest reason that people help each other. He? Yes, schools, missions, food for the poor, charities. If there is a God, He or She or It doesn't give a rat's ass about what goes on down here. Why would you say that? Why would he let millions of people suffer and starve and kill each other over nothing? Huh? He let Christopher die for no reason. We have free will. Oh, Jesus, don't give me that "mysterious ways" bullshit! Chris was the best one of us. The one everyone liked. He was good at everything. It should've been me instead. Or you. Chris got in the car with the wrong guy on the wrong day and the seat belts were broken and they were going 70 in a 45 and I should've let him take the fucking truck. Okay? There's a reason people go to confession. They want a fresh start. They want absolution and God grants that. Oh, I know. People love to be told that they're forgiven and it's not their fault when they've done something they regret. You see, at least I have the integrity to accept the shitty things I've done. Where as you, well, that's why you're here, isn't it? Ice fishing? The church. I'm here because I'm called to spread the message of God's love. No, you're here because you've judged yourself guilty and putting on that little outfit gives you the power to drill that guilt into everyone else and have them beg for the forgiveness that you can never have. And you're signing up to punish yourself for life. Aren't you? I'm sorry if that's what you believe but if you really think that, then I challenge you to come to mass on Sunday. "Come to mass." Week after week, drop a dollar in the hat and send a billion to the Pope so he can live in the most lavished palace on the planet, tax free. If you came, you would see how much positivity people get from it. A sense of community, man. Oh. A sense of "communion," eh? All right. Let's commune. We'll be commun-ists. You know, as best I recall, I don't remember the bible preaching against this wonderful plant. Smoke this with me and I'll come to Mass. Next Sunday. 9 AM. And let's be honest, after you sad little start-up here, you need me. Yeah, I guess so. Why, you do PR now? Game on! Keep it burning! Yeah, dude! Yeah! Oh, hold on, hold on. Woo hoo! Say, "cheese." Fromage! Nice. Woo! Well, you want some pike? Eh, Northerns aren't any good. In the winter they are. Think Nicole would want it? As like a peace offering? If we filleted it up or something? Although she is known to munch the tuna, I'm pretty sure she's a vegetarian, so. All right. Back to your home, little guy. Oh, get in there. He doesn't want to go. Woo! Huh? Hey, don't worry about the chicks. I got something that will appease. Oh! Oh! Woo! Yes! Woo! Hey, Cass. Danny, Cassidy. Cassidy, the Deacon Daniel Sullivan. I was raised Catholic. You could've given me communion. You didn't have to act like a homophobic prick like that in front of everyone. I'm sorry, I didn't think you were hungry. What the hell? Girlfriend, we come in peace. I have a present for you. Give it to me then. It would be better for the both of us if I gave it to you in private. You smell like fish. Oh funny, I was gonna say the same thing. Now this is just a little peace offering from me and my brother, Daniel. But I still need that hundred from the last one. I got 60. Okay. Hey. Even Danny toked a little. Yeah, no shit. No, I did not. Said he's puff if I came to church with him next week. I'm so sorry about church. I just had everybody watching me and a lot of restrictions and policies that a lot of individuals. You are so high right now. Don't, please don't tell anyone. We don't exactly hang out with the same people. You see? That's the problem. And that is why Danny and me are throwing a full-moon Soirée this week, down at the fishing hole. Outside? Hell no. We're gonna have a bonfire, booze, tunes, and there's always the little shanty if you wanna warm up and get cozy. So you're going then? Yeah. Are you going? You guys should go because it's gonna be fun. Okay, well I'll bring the absinthe. Yes! All right! Woo! Should we smoke some of that? Yes. You're smoking us out. Come on, Cassidy. All right, all right. Dick. You are such a prick. So you're selling? That's your "work?" I provide a natural alternative to pharmaceuticals for a select local clientele. You're a weed dealer. You do realize I just fixed everything with them for you, right? Gotta make a living, amigo. You coming? I don't get it. You were Mr. Honor Roll. You were on the math team. You're so smart and you coulda done anything with your life. It's just a little sad. I know you saw me at the nursing home last week. Yeah. I should've said... That's no the point. The point is, I was there because I bring medicine to a sick 82 year old woman whose medical treatments sucked the life out of her. And I bring her the only thing that makes her feel any better. Let's her put food in her stomach. Helps her sleep. She would take a visit from me over one from you any day. So save your holier-than thou attitude for the sheep. Hello? Are you trying to kill me before the cancer does? Father Rob? You got friends making a scene in Church? You stood up the Marxes? You got arrested and the car's been impounded? Am I missing anything here? Yes, no. No, you're not. I wasn't arrest really. Even better question. Do I need to pull out my IV and personally come over there and knock some sense into your thick head? No, Father. I'm assuming you're going to wisely use your time and you're gonna get it together for next Sunday because chances are, I'm not going to be able to make it again and you're gonna be the one up there in front of the congregation. Yes, sir. Now I expect to hear a glowing report. Oh, hell. Maybe I made a big mistake with this. No, Father, I... Don't talk. Just fix it. And for the love of God, Danny, don't fuck it up! Don't F it up. Yeah, that's right. Okay.

You know, I'm sure he would be... You're supposed to be helping out the Church wherever you can, yes? Absolutely, Mr. Sheraski. Then you'd have a minute to speak to a parishioner in confidence, wouldn't you? I guess I could. Thank you, come on. Let's go somewhere else though. This one's fertilizer. Oh man. Is that Clarence or John Paul? I think they're identical. This other one doesn't look much better. Don't! What? I could've taken him to Father Rob for a blessing or a burial or something. I don't know. Just get him a new one, he won't know the difference. What did you want to talk to me about? Thank you. I thought your homily was a bit clunky. But I agreed with your sentiment. Thanks. There are some things I'd... I'd just like your ear and a guiding hand in prayer. Certainly. Dear Heavenly Father, I was rude to this young man whose competence I doubted. But I was wrong, and see that he is capable of being the leader we expect him to be. He gave us directions to stay on the right path and to keep your church sacred. I... I... Even at my age and with a family. Go on, yes? It's a poison of the mind but I can't help but dwell in impure thoughts from time to time. That's a very common affliction. Can you help me purge these sinful urges, Daniel? Only God and a strong will can do that. Let's pray together. Yes. Please, let's pray. Hail Mary. Full of grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus... Stop that! Pray for your sins. I'm sorry. Your best hope for salvation is to seek God's mercy through reconciliation. That's why I'm here. Go see Father Rob. I can't help you. Thank you for your service, Father. Deacon. I can't take that. It's for the Church. Bart! Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed. What's this? A donation. Why do you do it? Why do I do what? Give so much of yourself to the Church. Well. That's... That's between me and God, Daniel. Whatever happened with Bart, I'm sure you did your best. We've all got something, don't we? Yes we do. I shouldn't have to tell you this but everything happens for a reason. I left my math homework at home. I need the truck. Find a ride with somebody else. I miss you. Hey. Hey, Nicole. I figured you needed a ride. A ride where? Well it's a full moon. You said you were going, come on. Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry, I can't. I got a hundred things to work on for Sunday. It's only Thursday. You have all weekend to study your homework. Cassidy's driving. What's this? This is Saint Christopher. He's the patron saint of travelers. Jesus appeared to him as a child and carried him across a raging river with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He's just supposed to keep you safe during your travels. Christopher. Come on. Will you have me home by midnight? Shotgun. Okay. Okay. Hey! Who invited this narc? Better late than never. Come on, come on. Woo! Shotskis! Hey, Dan the man, you're in this too. Let's go, let's go. Okay. Uno, dos, tres, down the hatch. Woo! What was that? That, my friend, is the finest Canadian blended whiskey money can buy. I'm sorry, does your pussy hurt? Even Danny took it like a man. Danny the derelict deacon, huh? Is that on a T-shirt yet? So what exactly is a deacon anyway? It's like an assistant coach. Okay, so like if the priest is Mike McCarthy, then you're like Dom Capers? Good analogy. Jesus. Between the two of you, it feels like a minority to be a regular straight dude. You guys. Just kidding, bro. You still play? Do it. I need to warm up, literally. If you're feeling warmer. Do you have a pick on you? Thank you. Yeah. Woo! Oh yeah! Come on, guys, is that all you got? Anthony, goddamn it, did you piss in the fire? That's what happens when you put it on frozen water, dude. This is bullshit. Where are we gonna go? Plan B. Where? You've got to be kidding me. What the hell are you doing? It's a big empty house, ideal for hosting a gathering of friends. No! There's no way in hell we're. Okay, okay. Okay, go, go, go, go. Go, go, quiet! Quiet! If anything happens. We might accidentally have fun. Oh! Okay, all right. Coming through. Okay, okay. What the hell? Hey! El Derelicto! Give me that. It's all right, it's all right, I got it. Hey, it's all good, okay? What do you need? Here. Have a malt beverage. Whose is this? It's mine. You can have it. I don't. No, no, don't be rude to the hot girl. Who are you again? I'm Stacy. You guys are gonna play, right? Oh yeah, just as long as I win. Deal us in. Hermano? You're lucky I'm not kicking everybody out right now. It's okay, darling. Relax. Sir, ma'am? No, next round. I wanna make a toast. Hey. To my brother. Yeah! I'm out. Three sixes. No way. Read 'em, count 'em and strip, sweetheart. Oh. You were bluffing? Uh oh. You don't have to. Oh yes she does. I'll cover my eyes. Do I? I took mine off. Let's see 'em. Ah! Clever girl. Thank you. Who's dealing? What? Come on. Babe! Danny! Yeah? Can you bring me my shirt? I don't know, my hands are pretty full. Come on! Okay, okay. Will you hook my bra up for me? My hands are frozen. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You get much practice with this? Only when the nuns need help. I'm just kidding. Time to go, ladies, come on. Time to go! Time to go! Everybody, time to go! Thank you, thank you! Thank you for coming! Thank you, time to go! Time to... She's out, man. What? What's the matter? Is Nicole gay or what? I mean, all girls are a little bit gay. Nic, she just likes whoever she likes. Why? Because. Anything to see my boobs, huh? Absolutely. Oh, no, no, no, no! Goddamn, girl. Revenge is mine, bitch. If you want me to take off my pants just ask. You cheat at cards, so. I do not. Do you have any dry threads? Yeah. Upstairs. Come on. Mi casa, su casa. God. Woo! Nice butt. Hi. Ow. Ow. Sullivan sandwich. Hey. What? I barely got to see anything. I know. Danny saw more than you. Oh yeah? Not worthy. They're very pretty. Pretty? They're very nice. Danny. Danny. Sorry. I should've even have to be here, Danny. Where's my freaking chainsaw? I need it. Oh, I'm sorry. What's going on? You look like a truck ran over you. Oh, yeah, I'm just feeling a little under the weather. I can ask Jake for you. Is he here? Let me talk to him. No, he's asleep. You know what, forget it. I don't need to talk to him. Just have it back by noon, all right? Noon today? Yeah! Today! It's down at the hole. Well let's go get it then. It was right here by the wood. This is perfect. A picture of your life. Alone in the cold, surrounded by a bunch of trash. Thank you for dragging me into it. You came looking for me, remember? Dumb ass. You know, I prayed to Chris to bring us closer together and then Nicole showed up, out of the blue, wanting to drag me out here. That messed me up. I wasn't gonna come. Do you hear yourself? You got what you prayed for, so I don't get what you're so pissed about. This isn't what I wanted. Well, I had a good time. All I wanted, Jake, was for you to do something right for once and stop, stop embarrassing yourself. You're the embarrassment. Signing your life away over guilt for something you didn't even do. I am the reason that Chris got into that car. Yeah, well, I'm the reason why he didn't have his homework. What? He pissed me off. So I took it. That morning before we left. You never told me about this before. What did he do to you? I don't even remember. I was 15. It as probably something stupid. So what, Jake? Chris dies and you say screw college? Screw getting a job? Screw my family, screw everybody? Pretty much. Why can't you get your shit together? You haven't stepped foot back here in years. You could've gotten out of this shit hole! I barely finished school. What did you? What was I gonna do? Move with Mom and Dad to Phoenix? You were halfway across the country. At least I had friends here. What did you expect? We were all crushed, Jacob. We all had choices to make. Yeah, yeah, and yours was to ditch me for a bunch of hypocrites and pedophiles. The seminary saved my life. The seminary saved you from living your life! Yeah, no, you just had to make sure that you were gonna be broke and alone. So I guess we have a little bit in common, you fucking hypocrite! Don't call me that. The first girl who lays hands on you since college and you're ready to dip your dick, Mr. Chastity. Shut up! Or what? You'll hit me? Huh? Come on, you little bitch! Hit me. Stop that! Come on, I dare you! Stop being a piece of shit! Hey. Come on, get up! Come on, quick, quick! Jake! Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Hang in there, Dan. Stay with me! Stay with me, come on. Come on, buddy. How long ago was the EPI? Two minutes. Hey. Is he? Where's Jacob? He's here. Down the hall. He's stable. I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no. No, no, don't touch that. What time is it? After 11. It's Sunday. I hate to say this. Especially now, since you're just coming around. This hasn't worked out at all. Father Rob and I really wanted it to but... That's okay. Bishop Byrnes is sending up a new priest this week, so we packed your things. If they discharge you today, you can make the four o'clock bus. Oh, Danny. You're a good kid. We're in a tough spot is all. Best of luck. They're talking about cutting them off. What about you? You got all eleven? I blacked out. They say my heart stopped for an hour. I don't get how we got out. I just remember trying to get air and inhaling so much water. Went dark. I had some crazy hallucinations. You coulda... No, I didn't mean to... No, I'm sorry. Don't apologize. It's not your fault. You saved me. Dude. Marx? He says he found us on the ice. What? We somehow climbed out? Yeah. Nic brought it. So they're shipping me off. They're firing you? Essentially. So back to priest university then? See that? Man, this party's lame. When did you get good? It's been awhile now. The priest said you got hurt. We hope you get better. It's fresh, just needs to be reheated. Mom, I wanna learn guitar. Sweetie, we can't... Do you give lessons? Oh. Yeah, yeah. I do. Give me that. Give us a call when you feel up to it. Mhmm. Giving your number to a 10 year old? That's my type, bro. You know what I'm talking about, Father. Oh my. You're sick. Okay, here. Help me out. Okay. Tell Nicole to bring my ride around back. For real? I can't afford this shit and I'm not sure I'm down with them chopping off my foot. You good? Okay, yeah. Can you forgive me? If I hadn't have dragged you out that night when you wanted to stay and... No, don't. My horoscope said that something really small was gonna turn into something so much bigger. Nicole, it's okay. None of this was your fault. Are you sure? Just be good to yourself. Ow. Oooh. So what's next then? A four hour bus ride. Smelling dairy farms. And then a shit storm from Bishop Byrnes when I get back to campus. Sounds like a gas. Yeah. What about you? Probably smoke some bud. Fire up the Nintendo while I wait to see if my toes fall off or not. A pair of dynamic young prodigies. Well. Stay out of trouble, Dan. You know, I figured I'd stick around for awhile. Until the whole toe thing blows over. Help you with some firewood and kick your ass at Mario Kart.
