Us, the youth of Yugoslavia, thank you for your support and belief in us. LONG LIVE OUR BELOVED COMRADE TITO YOUTH DAY - OUR DEAREST HOLIDAY LONG LIVE MAY 25 (qqz - Tito's birthday) We are happy for your support which inspires us to carry on with fulfilling... our duties, in order to reach the ideals of socialism and peace. By delivering the Youth Relay, I am conveying the best regards and wishes... ...for your happy birthday. (Tito speaking) I would like to thank... all the participants who participated in carrying that... er... this Youth Relay. I would like to thank the peoples of Yugoslavia... who sent their wishes via our youth. Of course, and greetings, as well as... ...our duties... expect... that we fulfill them. YOUNG AND HEALTHY AS A ROSE I am happy that our youth, with such joy on their faces... ...and in their hearts is celebrating their Youth Day. I would like that our youth continues to celebrate... their holiday... every year, that holiday with a lot of joy and happiness. And that it, the same as now, remains faithful... ...to itself, that is - to its socialist homeland. I expect from our youth that it will... ...not only do what their parents desire... ...but what our whole socialist community expects them to be. Be faithful guardians of our revolutionary struggle's values. ...to guard those values... and especially, that desire... ...and especially one of the foremost achievements of our revolution... ...brotherhood and unity... that they build unity together... ...to keep strengthening it... because the brotherhood and unity of our peoples... ...that is the foundation of our future victories, so that all our... ...difficulties can be fulfilled. I ask you, the young ones... ...please do everything so that our... ...socialist community is as strong as possible. ...so that love and great colaboration reign among people... It's you, the youth, who must... ...and I can say, for all of us... ...who are responsible for this country... ...that we fully trust our youth. I think that we can be proud of our youth. Our youth... wants... ...to have the youthood that we did not have. They have the right to expect a joyous youth. And we expect from them to take part in our society... ...to do their best to make Yugoslavia great It can't be great geographically, but... in spirit, and by in its efforts. And to closely guard our independence, and sovereignty... ...that was paid in blood. Thank you! Stevan Nikolic, aka Steve, born in 1945 in Belgrade; parents George and Aleksandra... Ex-pioner, x-member of People's Youth and Socialist Union, ex-youth activist, ...ex-member of Communist party. Of working class extraction. Trained car mechanic. Run away from hom. Petty thief. Stole cars. Influenced by wrong people and movies. ...tried to emigrate. During army srvic kept up his antisocial behaviour. All correctional efforts failed. Eight months of military prison. Look! A dead man! It's nothing... it's just red paint over his nose. That's it. Cowboys and Indians. Rejoice - there's a dead man there. - Who? Where? It's true. But what can one do? Ciao Mama, ciao Daddy, ciao ragazzi!!! Unruly, lacked respect for officers... Brought whores to army barracks... Pimped them to naive soldiers... Impregnated local girls... Drank in pubs on officers' tabs... Brought liquer to barracks... Slept on duty... went AWOL... fought with military police... Stole an army truck, got drunk and took off with two guys towards Nis... One should help those who are in love... The whole world is against them... These two proved that they love each other. Get out! Out! Tak a walk! Come on bro'! We're not kids! - Don't bullshit! - Don't be rude! Karat! Minimal strenght, maximum efficiency. Do you want to stay with me, or faithfully croak with that schmuk? I want to stay with you. I love strong men. You know, I'm a modern, emancipated woman. Bye! Get the fuck out!! Let's pick some flowers, kids! What an age! Love - the most beautiful thing in the world! But for little kids only. Or, Romeo and Julia in 1971. Fuck it. Inattentive and cocky during moral-political army courses... Told history lecturer that he is not intrested... When asked what happened on Nov 29, 1943 in Jajce, he answred... How could I know when I was born in 1945... When asked what he did before army - he laughed and said 'was a cool cat'... During an undesreved night on town, started a drunken brawl with civilians Bullid couples at the New Year's party, tried to rape some girls with some friends... Resisted police arrest... When asked why he was doing that, he answered: We are secret agents, you motherfuckers, we want to fuck these people's minds... The cars should be treated just like pussies - be rough and tender... ...and then say 'whore, I'm your god'. Constantly played dumb, ridiculed officers, bullied Albanians... Sent for psychiatric assesment - found to be healthy with above-average IQ... Upon release from military prison, when asked if he will now change, retorted: 'Dunno, I can promise anything now, but don't want to be called a liar later'. On doesn't know what'll happen next! As they say - life is tough! Play dumb when things get tricky... - 'that's the trick' - said Buster Kaeton... Excuse me, comrade, did you happen to see a man... ...in his 40s, short, stumpy and bold, driving a Ford Taurus? No! Unfortunatly not! Is he a spy, by chance? No, even worse - a triple murdrer - killed wief, mother in law and his child and now on a cowardly run! - Oh, such gangster times! 'Ti vogli bene a morire! ' Get off my back! Old man, let's see what kind of a lover you'll be now, as a proletarian? Excuse me, aren't you a father and a daughter? - No, why? - Just asking. This shit is for loosers! For fucking away in countryside, not for Belgrade! Tell me which car you're friends with, and I tell you what you're worth! As said by me! Write that down! Getting laid dosen't depend on genetics, nor talents... Someone said it's 5% talent and 95% hard work... Forget skills or hard work... I'm too dumb for such jokes... Just a retard, an idiot... What I dig - real hunks, well dressed, shagging good chicks in great cars. If you don't like Ancient Slavs... if you don't like our hreoic past... if you don't like our painful rebuilding and development... if you don't like our socialist community... Buzz off to ever more beautiful future! Long live the Yugoslav standard of living! Yes? - Doing well, how'bout you? - I'm working - Doing what? Petting low? - Yah, but flying high! One who flies high, has a long way to fall! - Really? Oh mother, you're so clever! - Mother? How's your mother? - None of your business. Seriously, what ar you doing tonight? - Buzz off, please! Promoting Yugo-sex, a turist attraction... - Enough sex, we need moralty! Moral, moral, moral... The best piece of ass in the whole city! - Oh, that's you! - Yes, me! What's the best chasis in Belgrade up to? Stipping, what else? Bravo, better on stag than in bed! Long liv eart! - Long live the bed! When are we going to stir up the old memories? OK... I know... today busy... tomorrow busy... ...in general, busy for a long while... OK, who says that young Yugoslavs, and the girls in particular without work? Have you had any sleep last night? - No, I fucked some sargeants! And so, wondering through life looking for happiness, I stumble upon you... I'm just your second one, right? ...I got goosebumps all over, look... Where are your chicks? - Marrying, getting laid, dying from love, chasing sugar dadies... They're lost in life and business... it sucks! My love, that's not important as long as we are here! - Hmmm, I must warn you... I have that awful disease, my willy's dripping... - Doesn't matter... I've got it too. - I woudn't want to ruin you... - I took some med... Is that People's militia station? In the interest of public health, I'd like to report an infected beauty! - You faggot! It's negotiable... For you, it's only 30 chimps... you've ben a good sport... You're lucky I didn't ask for a gorilla! Next time, pay more attention to personal hygene! - You faggot! Me, faggot!? You, gonorrhic snatch! Whatever! Hey bums! What's up! You bunch of fraking 'models'! Fags, queers, fagots! Screwing around the world and shaming this honest country! Cool off! You're not at a union meeting! - There is more and more sex... There is more sex. Screw it, that's what it's like now. What can on do? - Why did you then beat a hasty retreat from there? Chicken, eh? They're scum, bro'. Nothing but petty thieves, small-time crooks... I'm ashamed to hang around with them. I'm dying from shame, I swear! Beat it, bums! Fuck your untalented mothers! How about you, bro'? You look worn out. You're fucked, eh? Double brandy for the gentleman! - To lift his moral a bit! So? You've been fucked real bad? - Let him be. Serious, bro', what's up? Have you been blowing anyone, shagging, fucking? What do you want again? - I decided to become a family man. We're doing bad. Some jobs have been cut, yours included. You're out of luck. The economy's depressed. So, stop by when you're around. And that's your thanks for me protecting you? Don't be childish. Yugoslavia wouldn't go to ruin without you. - You're ungratful!! PEOPLE ARE OUR TREASURE There is nothing now. Come by in a few days. Som grate deals are being brokered with foreign investors. Listen old man, don't fool around! I'm asking whether there is any gigs for me here! I don't want to work for rotten capitalists! I love my country! Today's youth! - I'm an idealist who likes to have fun, a lot! What is it, faggot? What? Come on, gorging time! Not with your hands! Not with hands! There can be no remorse after stuffing yourself! I'm a partisan, that's my honour! Not evrybody can be that... I won't give it to you! Wish it's your last! I wish you poison your stomach! You overeating shit! Oh, you're so naughty! Come on, that's not nice! Are you not ashamed? People are watching you! Shame on you! Watch us and make notes! - Phew! What will your parents say?! Wow! Look at that dextrity! Careful not to impregnate her! Miki, is it nice outside? Long live Yugoslav TV! For adults only! Let me show you something. Miki are you hungry? OK. But only 60% initially, until we're back on our feet. Don't clean the stable while working! Don't touch it! Eat shit! He's sleping with your wife! So, how is our fucking? What d'ya say? How do you think kids are mad? Kids ar not brought by storks, but by small birdies (shags). I'm industrious! I always giv e100%! And I ask for 100%! Otherwise, I lose spirit! By the time you're back on feet, I won't be able to stand on mine!! Here! Climb here to see Konstantinopol! That magazin you won't read! You can only skim the suprmarket rags! You're doing fine. While I'm breaking my back, you're stroking your balls! New social games! And if you're not good, I'll move you to a new office - just pick your plot! Male whore! Female whore! In brief: A young man who could have been a useful member... of the socialist community... or, how young talents ar wasted... What will the gentleman have? - What, there are no gentlman... we are all comrades now! Old Yugoslavia disappared in 1941. I am not drinking anything! What is it! Nothing! I'm an anti-alcoholic! That man there is buying you a drink. He's asking what you'll have. Might he be a member of the Communist Party of Yu-uuuu, a fag, damn it! Could you be my long lost uncle from America? - Sit down. Want a drink? From cops - I take only punches! - Don't bullshit. I'm asking you nicely. - Milk! - Give him milk in a baby bottle. - So, how are you supporting yourself? - From former love and present air. So, what you're up to. I see you frequent bars. - I trumpet. I do what I do - screwing with the crisis, fuck around... I'm an honorary chairman of the layabout club. I do stuff, how do I know what I do?! Come work for us, for the law. What do you say? For police? Sure! How much are you paying? I want everything, but first I want the money. What's the pay? - I have a family to support. - Wait, you infiltrated them. - How do you know? - You know all that scum. You'd be handy. - To help track down th ebad guys. - To tell on people? How much you pay? I love law and order. How much you pay? Be fair. I have a consciousnss to satisfy. I'd have to get lost if I tell too much. Be fair and Iet me know. - The boy's leaving already? - We'll meet, wait for me faithfully. - Thanks Daddy. I really like you. - Fuck your mother! You old rag! Fill it up, friend! - Hands up! - Please, why me? Aren't you sorry to be like that? I work in a bank. Why are you so stupid? Why did you need this? You draw a gun on me, I draw a gun on you. Take it forever. - Some sense humour! - Ciao, a honeymoon, eh? - I have a job for you. - Ciao baby! What about me? Our love was short but hot! - Come on, beat it, smell the flowers, read some poetry! - You disgusting fag! You cheap whore. It's over. No dicksucking tonight. Beat it! - Do you know the Fat Mickey? - The Disney one? I may have heard. - Do you know the Boss? - Not personally. - You know what the trick is? The Boss wants the night to swallow Mickey. Drop down, I killed you. - What's up old man? Corrupting the youth? - You wouldn't shoot me, would you? Maybe I will. Stay were you are. Still wanna play macho? Don't move!! Are you really the one? Not a cousin, twin brother, or something like that? I woudn't want it to look like a 'printing' error later. Stop! - But why? - You'll see later. How do you like it here? Nature, nice nature.

Four... three... two... ...on... zero... two zeros... Don't forget me, bro! Write when you get there. Play cops and bandits? I'm your man. - I'll beat you up now. - And just how will you do that? - I'll disfigure you. - Beat it, asshole. The sheep are here. We'll swim in money. You get the left one and I'll do the right on, OK? - OK! It was no use fighting, but we still did. Give me the money. The money!! All of it! Get inside. Inside!! The pric of jailtime went up, because you're poor boxers. Close them in there for the winter. - Where's the dough? - Have no idea. If you don't know how to think... So that you can have some rest, son. Good night. You can kill, this is a free country... ...but don't hate anyone... ...as said by Richard Widmark. In the western 'The law of the Prairies'. An important announcement. Finally, I found the part of my personality that I always missed. The gun. A man's best friend is not a faithful wife, nor... ...a good buddy, nor a loyal dog. I don't appreciate such dark humour. A man's best friend is... what do you say? Please say... You have a little bit of time to think. Right! The gun! As said by me, in my intimate diary, which I still have not begun yet. Page thirty three... What is it? What were you doing tonight? Shame on you. My trenchcoat. Trenchcoat! Open it. Faster! Why are you smiling at work? You little servant. Cigarette! Want a lick? Watch the door. - Hi, how are you? Get up! - Yes, my dick is up. - Relax, bro. Hands up! Do it! - I don't like men. - Stop fagging around - I swear. - Really? - Really. Don't you worry. I'll give you a haircut. A fashionable one. Quasimodo style. - Do you know this guy? - Me, no. Why? I have no idea. Have a better look. Is this a TV quiz - guess the celebrity? What do I get if I guess? - Get up, punk! - Oh, you'r so tender. - Your little hands. - You're a real man. My love for you is thick - poke you with my naked dick! - Where were you that night? - In bed, making passionate love... - Who with? - My mom and dad. - What, don't you know who this is? - No clue. Nobel winner for literature? - Where were you the next day? - In bed again. - And after that? - In cinema - What was the film about? - Excuse me. - Nothing, it was Godard! I can't remember. I don't know. - Remember!! - You're so annoying. I don't know - What was the qustion? - Where were you? - Why, in bed! - Who with? - Mom and dad. - Who is this? - No clue! Nobel winner in literature. - And after bed? - With mom and dad? - And later? - At the movies. - What was th movie about? - Nothing, it's Godard, as I said. - Remember... - The water is receding! I'm going senile. - Remember! - I have no clue. My God! God, you some... Water's receeding! I'm going senile! What can I do? What are you looking at? The beauty is not contagious! - Hi, I'm her. Can I go now? Why are you after me like dogs? What do you want? Listen you! Without a gun, you're a zero! - I'd love to get you, and I will on day! - Even with a gun, you're a double zero! - You can pull my... - Take him away! - Get out! Careful, dandy, don't disappoint us! - You climb it! I won't do it again, my pioneer word of honour! Daddy!!! Look what they are doing to me! They're bating me!! Faggots!!! Hallo mom! I'm over here with a great bunch of guys! ...only, they want to change my appearance! Tell to daddy that I'll have to change my ID card. - What the fuck! - Leave it! - Get out of here! Get out! Out!! Out of the way, faggot! Daddy! I'm fed up with everything. Just killed a man. ...now you tell me how... will... th etwo of us... Click! We've been looking for you for 3 days now! Everyone's complaining about you. - They say you're a king. - A king? In a republic? We're making a story about young delinquents. Cut the formalities! What is it that you want to know? What would the print, radio, TV and transistors like to know? Almost forgot the most importnat thing - what are you paying for this? A 'brick' - I say, a million dinars! I'm dropping the price becaus you're promoting me... C'mon daddy, say what you would like to know about life? - I don't have much time! Hurry up! - Your favourite phrase? A bating stick cam from haven! You know, I'm a patriarchal kid! I don't think anything about women - Iet them think about me. Whenever I look at one - she starts throwing up or craving pickles... Of course not! Chicks are chicks. And you know what they're good for? It's not my fault that I'm not a chick. Life screwed them up, that's it. - What's up with those glasses? - Glasses? My heart is on the left side... ...love in socialism, socialism in love... - Have you ever ben in debt? - In debt? Of course yes. Never! I don't like such questions. In fact, I was in debt once. I was deep in debt when I was penniless, fuck it! Don't anyone say 'fuck your mother'! Oh, sorry mom! Happy? Almost always! Sorry? Why would I waste my life - it's my mom's and dad's fault! - C'mon, next question! - Your life philosophy? - Life? Of course - attack is my philosophy - suki, ma-geri! - A historic personality? - Historic? Why, me of course! Ha, how you like this! I'm busting you! - What made you take this path in life? - What made me take this path in life? Well, dark films, black films... - Your favourite hero? - Can it be from animation? Donald Duck and his cousins! C'mon, how much are you paying!!! Don't make me shoot! Can I ask you one question, you faggots? Excuse me, I have a phone call... a phone call is calling me. Hello, Ue Tant is here. Don't worry a thing. We're all here, daddy. Daddy, don't you worry a thing! We're preparing a pyrotechnical seanse. Don't you worry! I know that the police knows their job, but come for an unforgettable fireworks! Daddy, you'll be delighted, I swear! Very exciting! Very didactic! A very righteous end, as my dad would put it. The dude was shot dead! He died just the way he deserved. You rap what you sow... and so on... and so on... But not so quickly! No way. You won't see that happen! Gangsters only die in old-fashioned films. In reality, it's the opposite. Therefore... to summarize... Justice only exist in films, no happy-end in life. I do hope we'll met again! I am your future!!
