THIS IS HIS THIRD D.U.I. IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS. WE WISH HIM A QUICK AND CONSISTENT RECOVERY... 911, WHAT'S THE NATURE OF YOUR EMERGENCY?

I'M NOT GONNA LIE. THESE POLLS ARE SHIT. SO WE'RE IN A DOWN SPIRAL, A DOWN TREND. DOWNTURN. YES, THAT. I'M SUGGESTING SOME SORT OF ECONOMIC INFUSION, YOU KNOW? SOMETHING THAT GALVANIZES THE COMMUNITY AROUND YOU COME ELECTION TIME. SIR? WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT MAN? LOVED HIS EARLY WORK. YEAH, HE GOT EATEN UP. HOLLYWOOD'S A TOUGH TOWN. WHAT'S THAT THING THEY DO THIS TIME OF YEAR IN ALL THOSE CRAZY HOUSES, ABANDONED HOTELS? LIKE A FREAK SHOW? KIDS LOVE IT. YOU GET A BUNCH OF ACTORS TOGETHER, DRESS LIKE CRAZIES, CHASING FOLKS, CHAINSAWS. OH, LIKE A FRIGHT FEST. WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE ASYLUM? GIVE FOLKS SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

IT'S RUMORED THEY PLACED THEIR FIRST-BORN CHILD INTO TREATMENT HERE, CONFINED HIM TO AN ISOLATED SPACE IN THE BASEMENT DUE TO HIS MURDEROUS TENDENCIES-- AN INNATE PROCLIVITY FOR KILLING THINGS. WHEN THE PSYCHIATRIST'S WIFE BECAME PREGNANT MANY YEARS LATER, HE MADE HER GIVE THAT CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION. SHE NEVER FORGAVE HIM. SO SHE KILLED HIM AND THEN HERSELF. BUT IT'S SAID THAT EVERY HALLOWEEN SHE CALLS OUT TO HER CHILDREN, CALLING THEM TO RETURN HOME. HMM. IS IT ME OR IS THIS BORING AS HELL?
