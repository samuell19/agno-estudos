I've been calling and calling and it's obvious that you're ducking my calls. I'm sorry. I've said a lot of things I wish I could take back. But I- I can't. Just give me a chance, that's all I'm asking. Meet me for coffee, please. It's just not Christmas without you. (phone ringing) Hey there! Hi, honey. Oh... Hi, Mom.... You don't sound very happy it's me. No, of course I'm happy. I'm just tired, I just woke up. Honey, you're still not hoping Tim's going to call, He doesn't deserve you. No, of course not. Don't be silly. I can't help it when I hear my little girl is depressed. I'm not depressed. Why don't you fly out and spend Christmas with us? I can't. This is Dave's busiest season,he needs me. Well, are you at least doing Christmas-y things? Yes, Mother. Tell me you have a tree, at least. I have a tree. And is the carollers ornament in a place of honour? Of course. You're sure it's not still in the box in a closet somewhere? Okay, you're like one of thoseX-Men, how do you do that? Mom power, and I was there for your teenage years, remember? Okay, Mom, I've got to go, Ihave to get ready for work. But it will go on the tree soon,I promise, and I love you. Love you. Goodbye. That was true love. I wish I could findmy one true love. Why can't I find my true love? You're not going toanswer me, are you? You're just gonna keep singing. I could put you backin the box, you know? No, I can't-- Mom would know,and I'm talking to an ornament. I could put you backin the Coffee.u know? I need coffee. I'm sorry I'm late. Because I know youlove Christmas so much, I'm going to presume youwere up late building toys. Well, you did insist onasking Santa for a spaceship. You know how hard it is tofind plutonium these days? Ah, yes, the old where doyou get plutonium problem. My mom called. They keep begging me tocome to Florida for Christmas. It's just... I want myChristmas to be cold and white. Florida's warm... and tan. And besides, every timeI go home for Christmas, I get stuck in an airport orsick from the kid in the row in front of me, who ratherthan watching a movie, prefers to watch me,and if he sneezes, so much the better forhim and his entertainment, not so much for me. And then when I get there, mymom parades me around like a trick pony to her friends likethey've never met me before-- She is your mother,comes with the dinner. I know, when I get home I feellike I haven't had Christmas. Like I couldn't justsit and sip the eggnog. Don't get me wrong,I love my family, but I just figured for once,I'd have Christmas on my terms. As a person, as an adult. And besides, you needme here, don't you? Are you kidding? I've had that seasonal-help signout for four weeks and nothing. And even if we findsomeone, they won't be you. I mean people comehere because of you. I would like to see thattrick pony impression, though. I mean people comehere because of I bet you would. (clapping) Oh goodness, thank you. All Christmas sheetmusic is 20% off this week!

I've known Davesince high school. We're just friends,co-workers, you know... Corrine, he wasn't a hugger. I don't trust non-huggers. Any guy that doesn't likepublic displays of affectioner. you can't trust. You know, I saw him inMacy's the other day, flirting with one of thoseperfume sprayer harlots. Harlot. Good word. I used it inscrabble the other day, but, Corrine, didn't wedrink a bottle of wine, you sang Hit The Road Jack,and I set him on fire and sent him off to sealike a Viking funeral?, We drank, I sang, and you held alighter to a picture of him on your Facebook page. We drank, I sang, and you held alighOh, and you un-friended him. Did the Vikings do that? They would have. He never loved youfor the right reasons. He loved what you did for hislife with your beautiful spirit. (buzzing) It's an e-mail from Dora,the chorus master. So? It's an e-mail from Dora,tI can't, you look at it. Of course, honey. "Thank you so much foryour wonderful audition. We were all surprisedto hear how much your vocals havematured over the years. Unfortunately..." We feel Kathleen is bettersuited to blah, blah, blah, and we are thrilledto have you in the chorus. Oh, sugar, I'm so sorry. It's okay. Obviously these peoplewouldn't know talent if it hit them in the face. Obviously. At least you made the chorus! Everyone makes the chorus. That's why it's the chorus. It's okay, and Kathleenis a beautiful singer. She's been with thechorus for a long time. You'll get it next year. Thank you. What do you say wedecorate that tree? Good idea. Will you pass me the box? Well isn'tthat beautiful. My grandfather madeit for my grandmother. Really? He was a glassblowerat a crystal factory before he was called to war. He first saw her when she started working atthe factory in the summer. He said she was the mostbeautiful girl he had ever seen. But he was scared todeath to talk to her. Why? He thought she wastoo good for him. So he just watchedher for six months, longing to say somethingbut never finding the words. Until Christmas Eve. They were thelast two people at Mrs. Sweeney'sChristmas Ball. He said "Every time I seeyou, I hear a song in my heart. And this is what it looks like." Then he started to walkaway but she stopped him. And there, under thefirst star of the night, Then he on Christmas Eve,away butshe kissed him.m. (whispering) Then what happened? He walked her home. He came back the next day andspent Christmas with her family, and after that theynever spent a minute apart. Until the war that is. My grandmother made ascrapbook of everything. Until theLook at this. Ah, look at them... Yeah, it's beendamaged over time, but you can still see bymy grandmother's smile and how he's holding her. That was true love. Amazing. He used to write hermusic instead of letters. He said it was theonly way to convey what he really feltin his heart. He never returned from the war. For my dearest Emily, yours lovingly, H. She would play his musicevery day and every night. It was all she could doto feel close to him. She would It was the nightevery day before Christmas when the last pieceof music arrived. Oh. So that's why you love thatpoem The Night Before Christmas. Oh.Yup. It gives me hope that lovelike that is possible... Can you imagine? It gives me hope that lovelike (singing)ossible... (singing) (singing) (singing) (singing) That was wonderful. Thank you,Merry Christmas. Let's go, gang! Wait! Would you all like to come in for a cup of eggnog? It's tempting, but I'm afraidwe have other houses that need a Christmas carol. Oh, of course. that need a ChristmaThank you. That is so weird. Oh, they all look like that. That kind ofThat Dickens-light thing. I guess you're right. Sure puts you innd ofthe Christmas Spirit, though. That it does. (whistling) Harold! Jerry, couldn't they havegiven me a better cover name? I mean Hark theHarold Angels Sing? It's a little on thenose, don't ya think? Cliches are importantwhen forming a narrative. They tap into theuniversality of mankind.

It's part of the cover. We have got severaloperations going on here. A lot of Christmas wishes and some very important steppingstones that must be laid. So... how did it go? Fine, I guess. She seems nice enough. Who is she?ss. There wasn't a bio in the file. She's just a girlwho needs your help. Why me? Surely there's somebody fromthis time that knows the city better than me. Harold, these are the rules. You get the file. You don't ask questions. You maintain your cover andnever tell anybody who you are. You do what's asked ofyou by Christmas Eve, and you'll get your wings. Easy-peasy. That's just over aweek away, Jerry. Good to see thewatch is working. If the file's right and she is looking forthis fairy tale thing? That's not so easy-peasy. I mean what if I fail? Then you're gonna berunning a hot dog stand like me, down here. Not that I'm complaining,it's very fulfilling. Believe me, therelish is better up there. They don't really exist. But, Jer, they're calledlaining,fairy It did for you, didn't it? That was a different time. But, JeMaybe, but don't telling,fairy Ithat to the man upstairs. How do you know this Dave guy's gonna still havea job available? It's a rigged game, Harold. You're meeting Dave at theJava Tin in a half hour for your interview. I didn't set that up. The man upstairsdoes a great you. His McConaughey'snot bad either. You gotta be slow. Okay, but does iteven make sense? I mean if something were goingto happen with Corrine and Dave, wouldn't it alreadyhave happened by now? They've been friendssince they were kids. If they tell me you'resupposed to get them together, They've bethen that's whatsince theyyou're supposed to do. Harold, sometimes weall need a little push. I don't know... I do. And remember your deadline. You got untilmidnight Christmas Eve. I know, I know... your deadline. Why so soon? Are they going to turninto pumpkins or something? Why so Who says it's about them? Harold, this could beyour last mission. Corrine, I want you tomeet our seasonal temp. You're the caroller. That's me. You're One of them anyway. You two know each other? He was carolling last night.

Oh yeah, I love 'em. I just thought youasked me to sing them, because they bring customers in. Well, I do like that, but that'snot why I ask you to sing them.

He might be there readingsShakespeare and Wordsworth.this. Believe me, I know Dave. He is the most no nonsense, selfsufficient guy I have ever met. He's been that waysince high school.

He's a little... out of touch buthe's very sweet. He has a watch that's countingdown the days till Christmas?. Excuse me, what? Yeah. You don't find thata little strange? That's really strange. Oh my gosh, do youknow what gets stranger? Dave opens up and saysthat he started the shop because of his loveof Christmas carols. Really? because of his loveof Christmas cMmhmm. That's kind of romantic. I guess. So this Harold hasmatchmaker syndrome. I never trust matchmakers,they're meddlers.

Well, I guess I got a taste forit back then and you might say ever since I've beenhooked on the written word. Hmm. Do you ever writeanything yourself? Hmm.I've tried. How about you? Well, once sort of.I've tried. Sort of? Well, when I was 7. I wanted to give a giftto my grandmother but I didn't have any moneybecause what 7 year old does. I knew Christmas eve was alwaysvery special in our family because that was the day whenmy grandmother had received the last piece of music frommy grandfather in the mail, because that was the day whenhe never came home from the war. Right, the sheet music Iheard you playing in the store. She used to tell me how shewould run to the mailbox Right, the sheet music Ievery day to get the musicstore. and then run back tothe piano and play it. And the night before Christmaswas the last time she received a piece of music, so even at 7 I knew that Christmas eveistmaswas very special to her.eceived So, I took the night beforeChristmas by Clement Clark Moore and I turned it into a tributeto my grandfather's memory. Okay, that that may be thesweetest thing I've ever heard. You still have it? No. When my grandmotherdied my parents asked if there was anything I wantedher to take with her to heaven, so I gave them the poem. At least you had thatChristmas together, right?
