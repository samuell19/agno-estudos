I'm a daddy's girl. I've remembered everything I've learned from my father. That stinks. Before the fighting started, we lived together above the bakery. I remember exactly how lovely it smelled. No. And? Snow Butterfly. That sounds really tasty. I always knew war existed, but never imagined it would one day come our way as well. Snow Butterfly, Sugar Hat, Rose Kiss, Chocolate Boat, Ice Hat... Little Palace, Rikka's Braid, Mini Hut, My Favourite, Cream Ball. Toda, stand ready to help! Yes. Hippity hop. Hippity hop. Yes. Come on, let's go. Bye, sweetie. Don't leave the school grounds. - Okay. Bye, sweetheart. Rikka. Now you're just like a rabbit. Look, I have an idea. Now we're Siamese twins. Toda, did you finish everything? Yes. Then you can go to Mr Ztap and get the book for reading aloud. Where are you going? Can Rikka please come with me, Miss? Can't you manage by yourself, Toda? Ouch. Ten classrooms, plus the canteen and the gym hall. All has to be cleared as quickly as possible. - Yes. Is 'cleared' the same as 'cleaned'? Wednesday cake. Wednesday cake. She took off with all her belongings. That's what things have come to now. Okay, thank you. - Hello, Grandma. - Hello, Toda. You guys have whipped cream on your cheeks. Funny. Why's there so much left over? Didn't anyone like them? I'm sure they did. - Hey, Toda. - Yes? You wondered why so few people bought our pastries, right? Yes. Come here. Come sit on my lap. Look, fighting has broken out in the south of our country. And now all the men have to go there to defend the Ones against the Others. And so do I. Here. Soldier's Handbook. What is 'ca-mow-Fla-ging'? Camouflaging? That's making yourself invisible to the enemy. But how do you camouflage yourself when you're in the street instead of in the forest? How do you camouflage yourself as a mailbox, or as a car or a lamp? Yes, good question. I didn't know I had two lamps in that corner. Look, a side table. Can I put my glass on top? And will it stay upright? Look, I'm a chair. See? - Hello. - It's me. I'll put Toda on. It's your mummy. Toda? I called to ask what you had for dinner tonight. We haven't had dinner yet. And, is there a new cake yet? Yes, Snow Butterfly. Nice name. Say, can you see the moon? Yes, it looks like a little comma. Same here. Do you remember the word for moon? No. - Moenzel. - Right, Moenzel. Is there a man on the moenzel? No, a woman. Hoedeloe, is this earthling girl Toda, over? Well,misselie, good night. Good night to you too. Dad? Grandma will stay with you. So we can look after each other. Not even the birds will see you're a fake tree. If they build a nest on my head, I'll always have eggs. Wait, I have a present for you. Go ahead and open it. It looks like the Snow Butterfly. Here. Okay. Don't forget, look carefully before you cross the road. And never go with strangers. And eat fruit, little lady, otherwise you'll get sick. We'll have a great time together, won't we, Toda? When will you be back? I don't know, sweetheart, but I hope as soon as possible. Where's your father? He's gone. He's becoming a bush. Hey, how did you know we were having a holiday? Did a bomb explode in here? My necklace is gone. Nothing is ever gone. It's just somewhere you can't see it. Here, look. Thank you. Oh no. Have a bite? Chocolate boat. Your Favourite. My Favourite. But close enough. Little Palace. Can I have one? Watch this. The best way to eat them. Toda, downstairs. Here, take your blanket. My music box is still upstairs. You're staying here. You hear? But it brings good luck. We'll make our own music. Ten little fishes swam out to sea oh no, said the mother, not with me. I'd rather stay here in this muddy old ditch because the sea is full of sharks and they'll bite you blub blub blub When will they stop? Maybe when it rains. I'm sure they'll go inside then. Rikka, come up here. I spoke with your mother. There's no war in her country. You're going there, Toda. I don't want to. There's no other way, really. It's just for the time being. It's become too dangerous here. Daddy would never agree. I promised Daddy to look after you, and this is best for now. What about you? I'll mind the house and the bakery. You don't have to worry about me. We survived a war before. Sommerzunseliestrassel. 27. It's got something to do with fruit. Apple Street or Pear Street or something like that. A picture of your mother. Let's see. Here. - This one? - Yes. We never seen her. You have, you just don't remember. - Is she still sick? - Sick? Yes, Daddy told me once that she had homesickness. Oh, but that sickness passes the moment you reach the place you long for. And one of Daddy. And you'll just have to remember me like this. 'Grandma.' Everything's been paid for, but this is just in case. Here's a copy of your father's passport. We'll put that inside the notebook too. I don't want to go alone. You won't be alone. They've promised to stay with you until you're with your mother. WAY BACK LARGE TREE SOLDIERS BURNING CAR, WHITE CHURCH, CROOKED BARN LARGE TRUCK, HOUSE IN RUINS, SOCCER PITCH Is the bus going back as well? Because I'd rather go home again. Return to your seat, young lady. Can you keep still for a second? Sorry, it was an accident. Yummy. My dad made them. He's a pastry chef. Or rather, he was a pastry chef. - Is he dead? - No. Your dad is the best pastry chef in the whole world. COMMON GOOD You can pick a bed. Tomorrow, the children without an address will be sent to a family for the time being. You can't choose who you'll end up with. Some people just happen to prefer a girl with blond curls to a loud boy. That's just the way it is. My name's Toda. Killer Joe. But you can call me KJ. Okay... I'll call you Stickie. Yes, because you always stick close to me. Go ahead, hand them out. I'm sure you like that, don't you? Don't forget to say thank you. Thank you. How about some more enthusiasm? Thank you. I could hardly hear it. You? No. One more time, but a bit louder. Thank you. Now it sounds as if you don't care. One last time, but from the heart. Thank you. Where are you going? I'm going home. But I don't dare to go by myself. Shall I go with you? Don't you have to go to your parents? Or are you going to one of those families? No, I'm going to my parents. They live in a castle on top of a very high mountain. It's always safe there, because you can see everyone coming. I'm not going to one of those families. If you have dirty hands, they don't want you. Or if you drop something. Or if you sniff back your snot. Or if you wiggle your feet. Or if you don't say thank you. You can come with me. You're the only one with an address abroad. That's why you get to go in the car. - But what about Stickie? - No. Here, little lady. Have a good trip. Maybe you can take me home? I know how to get there. Or don't you understand me? Look. Okay, get out. Maybe we're abroad already. No. You have to pay. Otherwise I won't take you across the border. My grandma already paid for everything. Oh yeah? Where's your money? If you don't give me anything, I'll leave you here. Is that clear? Got that? It's not enough. Hey, that's no way to treat a child. She says she's been paid for. Shut up, or I'll leave you here as well. That necklace will do. Okay. Get in, we're going. You can't stay behind by yourself. Let him have it. Come on. Wait inside that house. At midnight you'll be picked up and taken across the border. Do you like the house? I thought I heard my father. Is your father a general as well? No, he's a soldier. Does he belong to the Ones or to the Others? He has a yellow mark on his sleeve. Then you and I are on the same side. Your father is a good man. Do you know where he is? A general always knows where his troops are. But since I'm retired, I can't say for certain anymore. Come. My wife will be delighted to have a child visit us. Come. Louise? Louise. Look what I've found. Oh, a child. Make yourself at home. You need something to eat and drink. Set the table. In the meantime I'll show you the house. Come with me. I assume you learned about me at school. I'm in the textbooks. Who am I? General Za... Za... I did learn about Zanzibar. Have you never heard of the Battle at the Water? In a certain sense I have. That was me. Pay attention. I received this badge of honor because I was very good at misleading the enemy. Because if you shout 'attack', the others may hear it too... and realise you're about to attack. So instead I shouted 'hotdogs.' My troops knew that meant 'attack'. But the enemy thought: Where did those soldiers get hot dogs? Understood? I received this medal for fearlessness. I was never afraid. And you? Are you ever afraid? I don't know. All right, I'll test you. Are you ready? A slightly heightened pulse. No sweat. Good enough. Hotdogs. Snail's pace. There's more to you than I thought. Hotdogs. Your war is over, Gerard. 'On est prié de venir a table. Let's say thanks for our daily food. Thank you for the food. What did you just do? Did you touch the food with your hands during prayer? You don't deserve it now... but if you do your best, you'll get a nice piece of meat every day. Bon appétit. I can't stay here. What do you mean? I'm only visiting. Is a bit of gratitude too much to ask? And we received you with open arms. Thank you. Where do you intend to go? I'm going back home. Why didn't you just stay with your mother? She lives abroad. But I'm your mother now. And we'll happily stay together. She says she already has a mother she must go to. But Gerard, this is our gift. There. I never wear a dress in bed. It's a bit short. I'll make you a new one tomorrow. Go to sleep now. If anything's the matter, we sleep next door. Hoedeloe, moenzel. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING AMEN Hippity hop. This makes it easier. Only a brave soldier dares to take the unfamiliar path. And that means you're going to your mother. Thank you. Mister with the cap. My Favourite, Chocolate boat, Ice Hat... Little Palace, Cream Ball, Mini Hut... FROM MUMMY. FOR MY SWEET LITTLE GIRL Who's there? Hotdogs. A little girl. Hello. Are you here by yourself? Have you lost your father and mother? I won't hurt you. I don't think it's allowed. You belong to the Others. It's just a color. I think it's fine. Thanks. Are you on the run as well? I have to go abroad. But I've lost the people who were going to take me. I have to cross the border too. I'm being hunted, because I failed in courage, leadership and loyalty. What do you mean by 'failed'? I'm a commander, so I have to command. But when the war actually began, it turned out I was no good at it. For example, if I had to say Tor-forward march', I would say: Would you please, if you don't mind, go a little bit...' The troops didn't know what to do, so they shouted their own commands. One would shout 'forwards' while another would shout 'left'. And I'd be standing there like: 'Guys, let's keep it centered.' It turned into one big mess. There are some things I'm not good at either. Like imitating a lamp. Or calling my mother. But commanding doesn't seem that hard to me. Most people can do it. They'll say: 'Go to bed!' Or: 'Hurry up!' Do you want to practice? I don't mind if you practice on me. What should I say? 'Move over.' And then I'll move over. Well, would you please just... No. Mo-move over. - Yes, move... Move over. - Again. Pinch nose. Wiggle foot. You can do it. Maybe we should be a bit quieter, right? Then later on we'll head for the border. How will we know where it is? Easy, we'll just follow the North Star, then we'll get there in no time. But I don't know the North Star. There, you see that fat one? That's the North Star. Your father will be relieved once you're safely with your mother. Forward march. Wait, you need a stick. - Outside. - Get up, get up. Outside. - Outside. - Come on. You have to command them. 'Go away.' Keep walking. Deer Daddy, were are you? I think you should come home again. Bye. Hoedeloe, earthling girl Toda here. Stop or I'll shoot. Stop or I'll shoot. What are you doing here? I was on the bus and suddenly there were soldiers. Then they sent me away. But what are you doing here? Here I'm invisible. But feel free to join me. Come on, Stickie. We have to go abroad. There's no war there. What does a border look like anyway? Like a wall or something? Or a bunch of barbed wire? Or white dotted lines on the ground? We had enough. Let's go back. Stickie. You look like a wet sheep. Wisselerie. - Slasselerie. - Slasseleeerie. Slassele-reedle. Maybe the border was invisible. Woe doensel woeje dor? Sedde woeje verdwalts? Sedde woeje verdwalts? Wasse die huzel? Huzel? I'd written my mother's address in this notebook. Komselie. Thank you. Do you have papers? And you? - He's my brother. - Okay. Come. Number 82352. Number 82043. See you later.

I don't belong to anyone. - Did you go to school? - Yes. What battle was fought - during the Third War of Envy? - The Battle at the Water? - Good. Do you have family here? Yes, my mother. But I don't know her address anymore, only the house number: 27. So you claim that your mother has a house here and you don't? Yes. What you're saying isn't true, is it? You don't have a mother here. Yes, I do. See, you're blushing. That's what people do when concealing the truth. What color eyes does your mother have? I don't know, the photo was black and white. You're clever, 82043. Clever enough to make up an answer. But I'm not making my mother up. Look, people without family in this country can't stay. The return procedure will be initiated. Till that time you can stay at the home for stray children. Okay? Romselstrassel. Wisselstrassel. 'Strassel' probably means 'street'. My grandma said it had something to do with fruit. You stink. Vilkrumsel. There. Oh, you are sleepy. Come, I have a bed for you. Come, this way. FRUIT APPLE, BANANA, MANGO, PRUNE PEAR -PIRSELIE. You can't get me. I'm a knight. We got a surprise for you. Today you can play outside extra long. That's nice, isn't it? Those children had to leave, didn't they? Just go have fun and play. But I'm not going back. I have family here. Famselie. Huzel buselie. Buselie... Briewzelboesel. Weje... wissel... boe... mamselie... hum... Who knows... where my mother's house is? Thank you. Hoedeloe. Joe wisstelsel bushels iewe briewselboezels! Da wees strawwelbier! Wrrrum hiebsel Joe bostsels gegrapselt? I wasn't stealing them. I wrote them. Look. I tore them out. I'm looking for my mummy. Mamselie. - Wees Di Joe mamselie? - Yes. Wassel hirre. Sommerzunseliestrassel. Hoedeloe my darling. This is my mother. Stickie and I have already met. Suddenly she was at the home. They let me go with her. Can Stickie stay with us? Stickie is always welcome. But before a child can live with someone, a lot has to be sorted out first. But then he'll get sent back. Not as long as someone wants him to be their family. What does 'Sommerzunseliestrassel' mean? Apricot. But literally it means 'summer kiss'. Here, I'll give you one. Come. Make yourself at home, misselie. I'm not as good as your father, of course. Thank you. Now I have a real mother. Though her cake isn't as tasty as my father's. Yummy. But I didn't say so, because I saw that she'd really done her best. Maybe she missed me just as much all those years... as I miss my father and my grandma now. I'm fortunate. I'm a daddy's girl with a sweet mother. - I like it. - I'm glad. Everyone is somewhere, but we can't see each other for now. Good night, Toda. Good night, mummy. 'My dearest sweetheart, if all's well, you're with your mother now. I think about you every day. As soon as I can, I'll come and see you. Then at last I won't have to be a bush anymore. I'd much rather bake cakes.' The Day My Father Became a Bush
