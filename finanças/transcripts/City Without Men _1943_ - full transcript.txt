[music playing] Hey, Tom. Yeah? Report captain wants to see you. Thanks. Want to see me, captain? Yes, I've got a letter for you Tom. It's postmarked Washington D.C. Well? This is it. They want me to report to Seattle on Saturday. Ensign Adams. Admiral in six months. Hey, Admiral, you ain't in the Navy yet, and I ain't going to accept your resignation until you pilot in the Lockhaven tomorrow. Oh, boys! Boys. Boys! Don't you know better than... than... I'll attend to you both, later. You know, uh, ensigns don't get rich. You mean we're not going to have much money for awhile? As a matter of fact, you're going have to frame that commission in burlap. [inaudible] in the world. Hey by the way, would ya marry me? Well, it's about time you asked me. When? Monday, July 2nd, Seattle, five minutes after I'm sworn into the Navy. Lucky. I guess you are. Well you're doing all right too. I'm doing fine. Start early today, Tom. Maybe the Lockhaven will be early too, for once in her life. Say, the Coast Guard patrol is going out to the point about the time the Lockhaven's due. You could go out on her and save Betsy the trouble. No thanks. Betsy would never forgive me if we didn't pilot in our last ship together. Lieutenant, you'll find our pilot, Tom Adams at the station out at the point. Will you ask him come in? The Lockhaven won't be here until tomorrow... disabled propeller. OK, captain. OK, you two, hop aboard. Certainly, sir. Go ashore, over there someplace, please. We go ashore at Fort Columbia. You have a nice boat, sir. You go pretty fast, hey? You go pretty fast, down this way. I'll give you $100. $250. You keep mouth closed please. You keep mouth closed please. Where's that pilot boat. This is their regular station. There it is, sir, about three point off the port bow. Steer the course. Coast Guard boat coming! Turn opposite direction. Emergency scene ahead. Take full speed! Now we wait and talk it over with Uncle Sam. Come aboard, please, all three of you. I tell ya I was bringing 'em in. Is that why you turned around when you sighted us and ran for it, Mr. Adams? They forced me to turn around. This one had a gun on my back. Really, Mr. Adams, no good to lie. I tell you I'm not lying! I got it away from him, knocked it overboard. Your manners is very badly, Mr. Adams. Now we all caught. They're sore because I was bringing 'em in. They're framing me! But you were more than four miles beyond your regular station. Listen, Lieutenant, I was waiting for the Lockhaven. I decided to run out and take a look for her. I spotted these two being put overboard from a freighter. I never even expected to see it out there. I saw no freighter. You're inventing badly, Mr. Adams. I'm afraid I'll have to put you under arrest. Listen, Lieutenant! There's nothing else I can do. Why would I want to smuggle in a couple of Japs? That's for the court to decide. [music playing] All arrangements previously made. [inaudible] was paid $250 to meet us. We picked up the defendant at a point four miles beyond the regular pilot station. As soon as he sighted us he turned and headed away from us. TOM ADAMS: The Lockhaven didn't show up. I spotted the suspicious-looking freighter out there and headed for it. What was the name of the ship? SS Hanseatic, London, England. SS Hanseatic, London, England. Officially listed by the British admiralty as sunk in Australian waters on November 10, 1940. [gavel pounds] Has the jury reached a verdict? JUROR: Yes, your honor. The jury finds the defendant guilty. Therefore the court does sentence you to five years in the federal prison at Blackport. JAILER: Stop where you are. Who do you want to see? It's OK, kid. It's the screw in that pillbox up there. Tell the little man who you're looking for. I'd like... And don't strain your tonsils. The joint's wired for sound. Oh. I'd like to see Mr. Thomas Adams please. I'm Nancy Johnson. Johnson to see Adams. LaRue to see LaRue. LaRue to see LaRue. That's me, Billie LaRue. Oh. - What's his rap? - What? How long's he in for? What was he dope enough to get caught doing? And don't tell me he's innocent. Well as a matter of fact he is. Isn't that a coincidence. 3,000 of them in here, every one of them innocent. Hey, you big lug, why don't you look where you're going? Oh, if it isn't his excellency, Senator Malloy. Hey, there's a chance for you, sister. He's head of the parole board. Why don't you tell him your little story? He only hears it 3,000 times a day. Thanks. Maybe I will. Hello, baby. Hello. Sit down you big ape. Take a load off your feet because what I'm going to say to you will cut you right down to my size. Talk some more, baby. I like to hear you talk. Well you won't like what you're going to hear, because I'm through, Monk. I'm washed up. Oh sure, baby, sure. Didn't you hear what I said, you big gorilla? I'm scramming out of here. I'm fed up. I'm telling ya goodbye. I'm going back to burlesque. The next bump I take's gonna be for dough. Some guy bothering you? No! Don't you understand? I'm quitting. Oh, sure baby, sure. Nobody sentenced me to 10 years of hard labor, working my hands off and for what? An orangutan who can't use his big hands like a gentleman. Talk some more, baby, go ahead. I give up. They can't make 'em that dumb. So long you big chimp. I'll be seeing you in 1948. Billie. Let me hear you talk some more, baby. OK, Gargantua. You win. Just another sucker, that's me. Sure, baby, sure. Hello. Hello. I suppose I should ask, do you get enough food? Are they treating you right? That's what people usually ask. Skip it, Nancy. It's good to see you. Even like this? That's a lie. You shouldn't of come, Nancy. I'm going to get you out of here, Tom. There's no use kidding ourselves. I'm in for five. There... there's nothing more we can do about it. We can get a new trial, Tom. We can fight. Remember me when I get mad? That a kid. Sick 'em. I will too, plenty. I'm getting a lawyer, Tom. Someone who can reach the right people. I had a lawyer, didn't I? You'd better forget about me and all the pipe dreams we had together. You can't forget a thing that was going to be your whole life. You got to. No use, Tommy, no matter how long it is. Nancy, go back home. It's no use, Tom. You do as I tell ya. Madam, if you place your husband's case in my hands I assure... Judge Michael T. Malloy, huh? You know what I heard about you? I heard you couldn't even fix a traffic ticket. Hmm. Michael Malloy, madam, attorney at law at your service. Not Senator Malloy? No, madam, merely judge Malloy. The senator is my beloved brother. Perhaps I could help you? Could you arrange an appointment for me to see your brother? If I could just talk to him... Now not so fast, young lady, not so fast. I couldn't bother my brother with a case until I knew all the facts. I suggest you come and see me at my office tomorrow morning. You're staying here in town, aren't you? Yes I'm staying. I'll do anything that will help. My dear you are making a wise and courageous decision. Until tomorrow then. Well, well, well, if it isn't Little Miss Innocent, in person. Come on in. Strike up the band, Dora. And play that schmaltzy part again about loving himself. Miss Innocent will love that. You seem to be everywhere, Miss LaRue. If it will discourage you any, I happen to live here. Oh on the contrary. Place takes on added charm. That one put a zipper on ya, big mouth. PARROT: Hello, Sucker. Ha, ha! Sucker, meet your new cellmates. This is Winnie, and that's dumb Dora back there. The bird goes by the name of Lifer. Girls, this little Miss Innocent, alias Nancy Johnson. Well I thought maybe you had a message from the prison. I've had the strangest feeling about George all day. What's your man in for? George got a long stretch for fraud, but he'll be out soon. Sugar, you don't have to slam the door like that every time. Get a load of this, it's Scarlett O'Hara. Why Billie, honey, you flatter me. You bet your life I do. Oh, this is Nancy, a new fish. This animal act goes by the name of Gwen. Hello. Hello. Oh, look at these hands. I used to have beautiful hands. Imagine lady of my type spending my youth in a laundry for $18 a week. Imagine a lady of your type being a lady. I've had about enough out of you. One more crack like that and... [inaudible], Scarlett, your southern accent's slipping. She's jealous, honey, because I spent last winter with my husband Chester laying on the beach. We stayed at the best hotel for New Yorkers all over. Where's Chester stopping now, Sugar? Irregardless, he's a very wealthy man. He's got $60,000. Half of it's mine. Well I hear that $60,000 belongs to the National Bank and Trust Company. GWEN: You'll all be sorry someday when Chester tells me where the money's hidden. You'll all be sorry. Yeah, so will Chester. Maybe I better come back later. Stick around, kid. All the animals in the zoo are harmless. Ms. Barton will be here at 6:00. She's always here by then. Just like a clock, everyday at 6:00. Was that Mrs. Barton? Mm hm. [inaudible] As soon as she sees Joseph, her husband. Don't be frightened. Everything will be all right. I've been here for seven years, waiting for George. Seven years? Yeah. So you see I know all the ropes. I can help you. I... I want us to be friends. Thank you, Winnie. They keep George in solitary. They won't even let me see him. You want to get your man out, right away? But how? None of the others will listen to me. But you're different. You listen to me. I've got a plan. It's all worked out. Winnie? Oh, this is Nancy Johnson. She wants a room. You better get ready for supper. This way, Nancy. This room is $9 a week with board. But I have another room. It's a little better, next to mine. This is Mrs. Slade's room. She's meeting us in the morning. You can have this room for $10. But that's a dollar more. This room is smaller than the other one. Yes, I know. But it has one great advantage. I don't like to see that all the time. Mrs. Slade doesn't agree with you. She says it brings her son closer somehow, just being able to see the walls. I'd rather take the other room. Very well. [horn] That's the signal for supper, the first signal. When it blows again, the men will sit down to eat and so will we. But we don't have to eat when they do. No. But you'll find you want to. I was showing Miss Johnson your room, Ms. Slade. He put his arms around me, called me mom. [inaudible] Oh, 12. Come and have some supper. I've got to finish packing first. Then let me help you. No, no thanks. How long is your man in for? Five years, but it won't be that long. Maybe not even a year. I hope you're right, but don't count on it too much. Every girl that comes here thinks [inaudible] at first. After that, she either quits or she leaves. But we can't wait. We were going to be married! You learn to wait. The years pass. But I don't want the years to pass without Tom. Five years, why, that's almost a lifetime. Five years, that's nothing. Nothing? Well maybe it's nothing to you but... oh I know why you say that. All your thinking of is five years of rent. You little fool. I don't want your money. You don't belong here anyway. Why every woman in this house puts you to shame. Five years. My husband's in there for life. I wonder what you'd do if you were in Mrs. Slade's shoes? Why she's leaving in the morning. Yes. She's leaving, with her son in a coffin. He goes to At chair at midnight. You can stay for the night, but please be out of here tomorrow morning. Well Little Miss Sacrifice is leaving. Can't take it, eh? I didn't think you could. [horn] That's the supper bell. Or maybe you're a little too good to eat with us. [music playing] RADIO ANNOUNCER: At the sound of the gong the time will be exactly 11:30. Our program of recorded music continues. [music playing] The Floyd brothers escaped in a storm. In a rainstorm just like this. [doorbell] I'll go. Ooh. Blackport Gas and Electric. [laughter] Come to check the meters. At this time of night. Who do you you're kidding, Mr. Peters. Hey, [inaudible], here's your boyfriend. Well, would you look at Ms. Miami, all done up to make with the eyes. Where did you rent those lashes, sugar? Good evening, Mr. Peters. Mr. Peters is teaching me all about electricity. I'll show you downstairs. And modest, isn't she? Give me this rain any day to what it was like in the desert last year. Pete was doing a stretch at Yuma. You and Pete certainly get around, don't ya? 7 clinks in 11 years. Regular crooks tour of America. Ha! Wow. Well. Elle, feed the horse. Drunk again. Wow am I wet. Yeah outside and inside both. Where's old lady Barton? Upstairs. Where you been? As if I didn't know. Who's the new [inaudible]? A five-year stretch name of Nancy, only she's beating her bond in the morning. One-night stand, huh? Can I get you something, [inaudible]? That's going to be a very pretty sweater. Don't know why I'm finishing it. Mr. Peters, honey, you're just ruining my lipstick. Well, now that I'm here I might as well read the meter. Oh Gweny, you tell your husband about us? Well no. Now look here, Gwen. Ah, don't scold me, honey. Well, uh, I can't stand hanging around like this. You've got to tell your husband about us, make him give you a divorce. But Mr. Peters, honey, you know you haven't enough money saved up, have you? No. You think it's easy for me? Looking like a slave in that awful Blue Bird Laundry? Quit your job. I don't want you working. But Mr. Peters, honey, I have to eat and have some place to sleep. The $17, $18 a week's very little to you, but... Well, $17, $18 a week? That's all. Well... well, call the Blue Bird in the morning and tell 'em you're quitting your job. Don't you worry about the $17. Oh, Mr. Peters, honey. [clock bells] I'm going to lie down. Five years doesn't seem so long now, does it? He'll be out and you'll have your best years together, like Joseph and I would've had. What do you mean? He was afraid I couldn't wait for him. He tried to break out. They gave him life. I'd like to stay, Mrs. Barton. And I'd to have that smaller room next to yours, the $10 one. Good morning, Judge Malloy. Johnson. Good morning, good morning. I didn't realize you're the Michael Malloy who won the Stanley case. You don't really remember that case. That was before you were born. I know, but other people remembered it. I had a civics teacher in college who did. Used to quote passages from your speech to the jury. That was a wonderful cause you fought for. Yes, I guess it was. The odds were 100 to 1 for a conviction. I remember waiting for the verdict. It took 36 hours. It was a wake. The foreman of the jury was a frozen-faced undertaker, and when he said not guilty, it was as if a... a dam burst. Young Stanley wept. His wife wept. I'm afraid I did too. They gave me that desk set. Never did work but I keep it around. It uh... it works in another kind of way. It reminds me... I don't understand. Why I'm here. As I told you before, that was a long time ago. I'm lucky you're here. I'm glad you're taking Tom's case. I'm not so sure I can now. But you promised you would. And I will. Yes, even if it means giving up another case. Thank you. No, not at all. Not at all. Sit down Ms. Johnson, sit down. Tell me your story. It's the prison time, Ms. Johnson. I'm sure you will appreciate the fact that very few of our parents would be broad-minded enough to accept a convict's fiancee as a teacher for their children. I'm sorry. Thanks. Everybody in this town is sorry. Oh, hello. Hello. How can I find the boss? That's him. Thank you. Oh, mister. What do you want? A job. Nothing doing. Look, um, please, mister. I want a job. I want to work here. Are you kidding? Look, sister, you come back at about 5:00 and I'll take you to dinner maybe. But for a working dame, I like somebody with a little heft, and you won't last an hour. Oh, [inaudible]. Now look, please, mister. Will you get out of here? Well roll out the carpet. Getting kind of democratic, aren't we? What brings you here? I'm trying to get a job. Are you still here? I told ya nothing doing. Oh you big lug, give her a break. Haven't I got anything to say about who works around here? I don't need another girl! Sure you do, I told you this morning. Gwen's retiring. Oh yeah. OK. I'll start you a $15 a week. Give her Gwen's spot. Oh, thank you. Now get to work. Hey, look who's here. Billie, thanks a lot. You won't thank me when you see what a small stack of blisters a mango can raise. I can take it. I don't know why any of us take it. Eight hours a day, six days a week, so that on the seventh day, as the Good Book says, we can enter the pearly gates of Blackport prison. Pick up your hat and coat, I'll get your uniform. Hello. Why haven't you answered my letters? Oh never mind that. Tell me how you are and what you been doing and how come you're back here so soon? Aren't you glad to see me, Tom? Well look at me. Nancy, you can't afford to come running down here every week. Well, see, I didn't go home. I've been here all week. What are you talking about? How about your job? Well I... I work here now. You mean you're teaching here in Blackport? No, but I got a job. Doing what? Working in the laundry. In a laundry? Listen, Nancy... Oh please, Tom. I've hired a lawyer. We're going to take your case to Senator Malloy. I've had my belly full of the law. You're wasting your time. Don't talk that way. How do you want me to talk? Please, your honor, I saw a couple of Japs drop off the Hanseatic. Of course I know the Hanseatic was sunk but I'm not a liar. It was just a... a ghost ship, a flying Dutchman. But you did see a ship called the Hanseatic and some way we'll prove it. How, by culling the ocean with a butterfly net? But it's the truth, Tommy, you've got to fight for it. I'll fight in my own way. And I'll fight too in mine. All right. Hang around here and be like these other women. Go ahead, thrown your life away. I can't stop you. No, you can't. Maybe I can't at that. Go back home, Nancy. There's no use hanging around here. Because if you come here next visiting day, I won't see you. Tom. But it's been two weeks already, Judge Malloy. I was hoping I could bring them to you to use tomorrow. You young people. Patience, patience, my dear. Perhaps next week. [whistle] Hurry, kid. Nancy? Nancy... Nancy do me a favor, will you? If you're going over to see Tom, will you take this letter to George for me? Well of course but why don't you go yourself? Oh I can't. Why not? They won't ever let me see George. George is going to get away soon. I've got his escape all figured out. You know what, Nancy? Maybe George would let Tom in on the plan. Oh, no. No, Winnie. I'm going to get Tom a retrial. Oh, well, your not sore because I asked, are you? I've got to hurry, Winnie, I'll be late. Ms. Barton. Give me that letter, Nancy. What are you doing? Don't! You couldn't take this to George. Why not? Because George doesn't exist except in Winnie's mind. He's been dead for years. But Chester, darling, if you only tell me where the money was hidden, I could be your lift to get you out of this awful place. It isn't the money, sweetheart. You know I just went into the racket so I could get you things. It started with that mink coat. Only if you had all that money I'm afraid I might lose you. Chester. Well even that time on our honeymoon, no more than a dollar was spent, you got feeling depressed and you was gone for five months. But I came back, didn't I? And honey pie, haven't I been right here working like a slave, ruining my health and my complexion, just waiting for you? Sure, sweet, sure. I know you'll go through fire for me, up to here. But I don't see why we have to stay here when we're so rich. I could be spending all that money on you, just to get you out of here. Only maybe after you got all through spending it, maybe I'd still be here maybe. And maybe you would get depressed again and you'd be gone and I wouldn't see you again for a year maybe. Oh you see what a spot I'm in, don't ya, honey? Oh, Chester. All week I've been waiting, and then don't tell me how you've been or did you read a magazine or something? Really baby, you don't tell me nothing no more. Can I help it if I'm in the dumps? That Johnson kid gives me the creeping willies. She just sits there like she's going nuts or something. If you want me to talk to you, you tell that guy of hers to give the kid a break and see her. OK, he'll see her. I'll go fix it, and you'll tell me how you've been and did you read a magazine or something? Talk to me like before, maybe you call me ape again, huh? Sure, Gargantua. Hey what's the matter with you? You a cripple or something? You talk to your girlfriend next time she comes. Why don't you keep your nose out of my business, Monk? I don't know. All I know is that Billie says she's got the crawling willies from Nancy. Look, Tom, you're a nice guy. I'll like ya like a brother. But if you don't talk to your girlfriend next time I'm going to bust your face, right in the kisser. You love Billie and you want to what's good for her, don't you? You betcha. Well I love Nancy, and I want to do what's right for her. She doesn't belong in this town and she doesn't belong in any crummy laundry. Ah, you know what I think? I think it's good for her, it'll toughen her up, give her plenty of muscle. I like a dame with a hefty wallop. I like her the way she is. I want her to stay the way she is. All I know... all I know is that if you don't talk to Nancy, Billie will kill me. And if Billie kills me, I'll kill you. They're coming now. Hey, True Love! [inaudible] is here again. Ooh, [inaudible]. Ha! Oh, Mr. Peters honey, how lovely. But you shouldn't of spent all that money just on flowers for little me. They cost $0.30 a bunch, but they're worth it. I know honey, but uh, I need a pair of stockings so bad. So bad's the only way you'll get 'em. You all just don't understand, does she, Mr. Peters? I'm sure you'll pardon us. Mr. Peters and I are going to an electrical exhibition. What are you doing, hun, teaching her how to rig a hot seat for Chester? Oh. You see, that's what I mean. I don't want you living in a place like this. But Mr. Peters, honey, aren't you forgetting? What? We haven't got the money yet, have we? No, but I'll get it. Oh, Mr. Peters, honey. I'll do everything I can. Of course I can't make him see you. I know, father, but, well it's just that he's been acting that way for weeks and I want him to know that there's hope for him. Please make him believe that. I'll have a talk with him. [organ music playing] Tom Adams, come with me. What's the charge, father? I guess it's called desertion. I'm talking about Nancy. Forgot it. All right, Tom. Don't get me wrong, father, I know what she's going through. I suppose if you can't get me to go out there and see her you want to take her a message? All right. Tell her I don't care if she's hangs around here the rest of her life. I won't see her. I don't care what she done, she's wasting her time. Tom, I don't think that girl's ever going to quit. She'll quit when she realizes I'm not the starry-eyed Navy boy she fell for. She's not in love with me anymore. She's just a... a kid all choked up with pretty ideals. She'd hate a guy that figures if he hadn't been sap enough to try to help his countries he wouldn't be in here. Tom, you'll be going out of her in a few years a free man. You want to go out into a country that's free too. What do you mean? This morning, two hours ago, Japanese planes attacked us. Without warning they bombed and killed our soldiers, sailors, and civilians. Right now, all over this country, 130 million people are getting ready to fight, not only the Japs, but all men whose hate would destroy our country. Your country too. They will be fighting for your chance to come out into a free world. I was ready to fight for that too. I still am. How can I? The important thing is that you want to. No. The important thing is that I get a chance to. Look father, there must be other men out there, hundreds of men who want a crack at those guys. Maybe if I talked to 'em, get up a petition, maybe they'll let us fight, parole us. Go ahead, Tom, talk the men. Fill up your petition. Go on, try it. You still want me to give Nancy that message? No, father. Not now. You think it'll be all right? Why doesn't he show up? Take it easy, baby. Pretty soon we change these clothes, huh? Just give me a crack at them Japs, I'll mangle 'em. Adams? Yes, sir. Here's the answer to your petition. Don't get hot, baby. What's it say? In response to the petition of the Blackport prisoners that they be paroled into the armed services of our nation, it's our considered opinion that... that... Do on, Tom. Here, read the rest of this bilge yourself. Please remind these convicts that to fight our nation's enemies is a privilege restricted to free men. Signed John P. Malloy, chairman parole board. But you don't understand, warden. I offered to go in the suicide squad. Listen, the army needs us. We know this racket. It's our meat. Warden, you got to make 'em understand. They'll afraid we'll take a powder. Yeah I was gonna take a powder... a keg of powder... right down [inaudible] smoke stack. Sorry boys, but it's... it's not up to me. Let's go, guys. We've been suckers again, that's all. Wait a minute, Adams. The rest of you boys too... I want you to know that I respect and admire your patriotism. It's the law. Your country's law. I'd like you men to go out of here feeling that. Not a chance. See we're Americans all right, just like the man who wrote that letter, only he's out there and we're in here. All right, let him do the fighting. Call up his America. OK. But don't come sniveling to us anymore with preaching flags. Tom! Tom, what happened in there? What do you suppose? They turned us down. We're not good enough for 'em. Don't say that. I'll get you out of here soon. I'll get out in my way and in my own time. You used to love me, don't you know? No. No I don't, is that clear? You're just upset because... Get out of here and don't come back because I'm through with ya, see? Sit down. Tom! [music playing] Monk! Here we go again. Tom! Take a good look, lady, he'll get solitary for this. No! MICHAEL T. MALLOY: Michael T. Malloy, madam, as you see by my card. If I can be of service to you... I've got to talk to you, judge, right away. I'm busy right now. Why don't you call at my office tomorrow morning. I want to talk to you right now. Excuse me. They've just thrown Tom into solitary. The parole board meets tomorrow doesn't it? Yes, it does, at 4:00 is a... I want Tom's case presented there tomorrow. His case isn't on the calendar. I won't take no for an answer! Why my dear Ms. Johnson, [inaudible] matter. I'm sick of you stalling, your depositions and your hokus pokus. And stop calling me, my dear Ms. Johnson. The meeting's at 4:00. I'll be at your office at 5:00. You've been calling me crazy for seven years, because you're afraid. Because I've got a plan! Winnie, forget it. I've got it all worked out. I even got blueprints of the prisons. I've got a plan that will work! Winnie, all right, all right, but forget it! Hey kid, what's your plan? Spill it. Billie. Oh but you just said... Oh I didn't want her in on it. Go on. What is it! Spill it! Well... well listen, every Friday night the freight boat comes to the jute mill. Yeah. Well those jute barrels are big. They're bigger than a man. Well our men could hollow them out and get into them. And then they're lowered into the boat. And then, then when the boat's out on the river... well don't you see? Gee, it might work. That ain't so crazy. That plan's a killer dealer, kid. Huh, Billie? Yeah. Yeah, it might work at that. We'd need somebody to run the boat. Oh but that's where Tom comes in. He used to make a living driving a boat. Tom Adams won't be part of any prison break. So don't count on it. You and Tom haven't been doing much talking lately. Maybe he'll feel differently about it after a few months in solitary. Maybe. Maybe tomorrow he'll be out on parole. Parole? Who's been giving you a high pole? Listen to her, girls, parole. Oh ho ho. Judge Malloy's before the board right now. He's putting Tom's case up to his brother. Judge Malloy is what? Deary you've been took in spades. Why he isn't even on speaking terms with his brother. He's a phony. That's not true. He's a great lawyer. He's won great cases. You're just saying that about him because you want Tom in on the break! Poor sap, you've been tossing away your dough. I don't want to hear anymore. All I know is that he's at the parole board right now, pleading Tom's case. The only pleading he's doing is for a quick one on the cup at Hannahan's bar. OK, kid, tell me that plan again. Well, every Friday night the freight boat comes to the jute mill. Mr. Malloy? Oh, Ms. Johnson, I was just about to call you. Senator Malloy had to postpone the board meeting... the war situation. You see he's... Yes, I see. You are a fake. Everything I've heard about you must be true. Why my dear child, you've been put up to this by evil intriguers, people who are jealous of the fact that the Senator has promised a decision in your case this very evening. Oh how can you be so cheap? How can you lie like that? Ms. Johnson, I will remind you, you're making bold accusations and in front of my friends too. All right, then. Prove I'm wrong. Call the Senator right now. I want to know his answer. All right. All right. I'll show you. I'll prove to you once and for all. Embarrass me in front of my friend. I've got only bills. Who's got a nickel? Hello? This is Judge Malloy. Yes. Is Senator there? Thank you. This ought to teach you a lesson, young lady, not to listen to idle and malicious gossip. Hello? Hello, John. Sorry to bother you again. No, nothing much. It's just the Tom Adams case. You remember, the one we were talking about today. Yes, that's the one. Splendid, John, splendid. Thanks a million. There you are. The Senator is recommending a pardon. Dividend for the phone company. You ought to over there behind those walls where Tom is. My dear young lady, our relationship has reached that delicate stage where there's no further point in lying. The truth is you have no case. You never have had a case. I'm misled you. I'm sorry. I'd like to be able to pay you back sometime. Thanks. Sometimes even that doesn't help. I just got a hot tip. They're getting out of solitary tomorrow. No! And the next day's visiting day. Think Winnie's plan will work? It's got to work. We'll spring 'em Friday night. Friday night. What are you doing Friday night? That ain't no kind of talk, baby. I'm talking big stuff, Monk. Now listen. What do you do Friday nights? Well what do you think? The same old thing. Oh, Friday night we eat fish. Friday night we got to work. What kind of work? We load the boat. We load the jute bails on the boat. They're beautiful jute bails, darling. They're big as a man. I get it. Yeah, I get it. Get a shave too. You need one. Chester, darling, I just got to have money. Why you can't expect me to arrange a getaway on a $17 a week. I thought you got $18. What I mean is, well, escapes cost money. Oh, you just got to tell me where you hid the money, sweetheart. You just got to, so we can be together again. It's a honey of a plan, Elsie. If anything goes wrong I can take care of myself all right. I got a knife, see. Remember the plan's no good unless you get Tom to run the boat. I'll get him. I'll break his face but I'll get him all right. I seen Nancy today, Tom. All through the visiting hours she was just sitting there, looking, not talking. You know for me she don't talk. You got some baby there, Tom. How'd you like to see the baby, huh? Bust out of here Friday night? How? Hey, girl, where you going, True Love? Well, I was just taking something to the cleaner. Sure. Chester, can you imagine a poor sucker falling for a dame like that? Walking out on him when he's risking his neck, just on account of you. If you'll please let me pass. Well of course, sugar. Let her pass, girls. Here's a pass for Pete. Ow! And this is for George. Oh, and that's for Sam. And that's for Monk. What's going on? Oh, oh nothing. Gwen just went south. For good. I feel kind of skunky, not telling about the break. And have her give us away? Little Miss Innocent still believes in paroles and pardons. [knocking] Maybe Gwen forgot her sugar rationing book. Gwen, where's Gwen? Why, Mr. Peters, honey. Well where's Gwen? It's a matter of life and death. She's thrown the switch on you. She's gone. Oh know look, this is no time for kidding. Where's Gwen, she's got to be here. I got the company's money all mixed up. And... and those darn auditors are checking up sooner than I expected them to and... Hmm. Oh she was just holding the money, $300. [inaudible] Hotshot, you're a walking corpse. Your bride's parlaying your $300 into Chester's $60,000. Oh! There she is, girls. Just eight more hours and she'll be pulling away from the dock with a load of our guys. My stomach feels like a bunch of mangos. I ate too much. One good thing, after tonight, no more laundry. Maybe my guy will do all right for himself when we send out the wash. Ha. It's going to swell for Mrs. Barton too. You mean her husband's in it? Sure. Monk felt sorry for the old man and let him in on it. Well, back to the clink, girls. Paper? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Hm hm. Come on, Nancy. News can wait. The dirty clothes go on forever. Mrs. Barton, I'm afraid I have to ask you to come with me. Something's happened to Joseph? Joseph. Joseph, it's Maria. Maria. Maria. Joe, no. No, no, something has happened. We're together now, that's all that matters. I was just trying to tell them. Tell them what, Joseph? The break, they wanted me to join them. I told them what happened to me. They wouldn't listen to me, Maria. I was going to the warden to tell him. Please Maria, before it's too late. Tell the warden to stop them. Who are they, Joseph? Sam, Monk, Pete... Who else, Joseph? Tom. Tell the warden, Maria. Please, will you? God. I didn't say what I wanted. Joseph, everyday I've loved you. Everyday of my life. And I will love you, Joseph, everyday the rest of my life. Ew, it's hot. You're all in, kid. Why don't you go cool off a few minutes? Joseph is dead. Stabbed in the back. Get back! I don't want your sympathy. Joesph was stabbed in the prison walls for trying to stop your - Crazy break. - The rat. No wonder they knifed him. He was trying to save them, and they killed him. And even then when he was dying, even then he wanted to help them. He asked me to go to the warden. Did you? What did you tell him? I told him nothing. You know why? Because I want that break to happen. Because I know it's a failure. Billie, Billie look at the... I'm talking to you too. Don't look so innocent. You're the worst of them all. You and your innocence, pretending you were nixing a break. What break? Take it easy, kid. And when it's all over, don't any of you come crying to me because I'm through with you. Will all the sympathy and health and love by the spoon enough to waste on you. What break? At 9 o'clock. We were going to tell you later. He's in it all right. Tom? Now take it easy, kid. Oh, let me go. If you go to warden... Get out of my way. Don't be a fool. They'll give Tom extra time just for planning this break. And our guys too. You sing to the warden and Tom will wake up with a knife in his back. Mrs. Barton? Is somebody getting a doctor? Why don't you call the warden if you want to stop it? No! Why come to me? Because if you'll give the case to your brother we can still save Tom. I told you, you haven't got a case. Read that and tell me we haven't gotten one. Read it! Mexico nears war. Good, more the merrier. No, no, this. SS Hanseatic sunk. Another one, huh? Fish won't have elbow room to swim anymore. Judge Malloy, don't you remember? The SS Hanseatic is the [inaudible]. It's true there wasn't any. You mean there was a Hanseatic? It was sunk last night by a Mexican gun boat. Young lady, you have got a case. A whale of a case. Then plead it with your brother. He wouldn't listen. Make him listen! He won't even see me. Make him see you. I'll go with you. Oh, I don't know. I think it's too late. I... I don't think it's in me. Judge, it's your kind of a case. You've got a cause now, the kind of a cause that made you great once. It made you a great fighter. Booze fighter, liar, fake, everything you said I was. You will be a liar and a fake if you turn me down no. You'll be sentencing an innocent man by letting him break the law for the first time. I've fought for the underdog in my time. I won all the lost causes, lost my own. Then go out and win it back. You won't only be fighting for Tom Adams, you'll be fighting for yourself. I can't stand the risk of losing again. [music playing] Another slug of your pour, little [inaudible]. Ms. Johnson! Ms. Johnson! You know my orders, Mr. Malloy. But he's got to see him. I'm sorry Missus. So am I. Mr. Malloy... Malloy! Gentlemen, the Alaskan situation boils down to this... it's serious but not brave. The question is, what does this senatorial committee bring back to Washington? Tompkins, I told you... That I was never to be admitted. Well he didn't admit me, I pushed my way in. You'll save yourself and me a lot of embarrassment if you'll turn right around and walk out. Well he came here for my sake. I'm here for my own sake. Please, Senator Malloy, there's trouble at the prison and you're the only man who can stop it. What kind of trouble? A break, 9 o'clock. Give me the facts and the men involved and I'll phone the warden. Oh, no! No. Her young man, Tom Adams is in it. He's the key man in the break. I came here to talk for him. What's there to talk about? He'll have to take his medicine like the others. Listen, John. I haven't tried a case in years, but I've got a case to plead now. A case that he would want me to plead. Hear me out. Then if you want to call the warden to ruin more years of Tom Adams' life, you still have time. We've got some pretty important work to do here, Malloy. I don't care how important it is. A man's life is at stake. Well we're concerned with the safety of 130 millions lives. We're at war, Michael, or hadn't you come out of your saloon long enough to find that out? Yes, I've come out of my saloon long enough to find out a lot things. Do you know what we're fighting for? Michael. I repeat, do you know what we're fighting for? I know why I am. For the right to my bottle, to sit around in a corner saloon. Yes, I stand up like you on the 4th of July and sing, O' say does that Star Spangled Banner still wave? Wave for what? Over my booze, that's why I sing. But I'm only a drunken sod, a disgrace to my country. Over what does it wave for you? Just what do you want, Michael? The thing worth fighting for on the seven seas and five continents. The thing we're overlooking here at home, justice. What's that got to do with a break? Get to your point. Tom Adams was jailed six months ago. He was convicted on the strength of a non-existing boat, the SS Hanseatic. This phantom boat, this figment of the imagination has now become tangible, gentlemen. See the motors? It's a cinch, Monk, twin diesel. A kid could run it. Good, baby, good. Not that one, Chester. Not that... oh! Oh. If this story's true, you have grounds for a appeal. Fine and days, weeks, months will go by. Let's think in minutes. Now 8:45. At 9:00 Tom Adams will make that break. All I need to do is to phone the warden and he'll stop it. By implicating Adams, by making him commit his first crime in the noble name of legal procedure. You're asking me to cover up a crime. The real crime is that Tom Adams was sent to jail in the first place. And if you let him make this break, you'll be responsible as he is. You don't know what you're saying, Michael. Take it easy. You've got the jitters as bad as Chester. Oh, I'm all right. Monk. Huh? Does he know about Joe Barton? No. Listen Monk, I had to do it, see. I had to lie to the old guy. He'd have talked. Shut up. Free Tom Adams, John, now, this minute. Let him know that singing glory of the just word freely given. Let him walk once more among his fellows, a free man in a free land. Long before that black day of December 7, that voice sensed this country's peril. He was ready to leave his job, and his girl. And she was ready to let him go, because she knew that was the way it had to be. Well he never went. An innocent man, he was shot away. On the day the enemy struck he volunteered again. The answer was no. Twice denied. Don't deny him again. I don't know, if I only had time. Time, time, time! 10 years ago when Hirohito marched into Manchuria, we could have knocked his big teeth down his throat with a backhand slap, but China was far away. We had time. Six years ago when Hitler marched into the Rhineland we could have put him in a lunatic asylum. But the Rhineland was far away too. Again we had time! I know what you're thinking, that these are big things and Tom Adams is small. Only one ordinary American. But he's part of this country, and apart of you. And if he dies, part of America dies with him. Before 9 o'clock, you must decide if he's worth fighting for. [music playing] Adams, come with me. Step onward! Everybody inside. Tough luck, hey baby? Listen Monk, we got to try it anyway with Tom. Won't work without him. Well what if he talks? What if they pump him about Joe Barton? Yeah, that's why they took him out of here, to put the finger on me! [siren] It's not 9 o'clock yet. Something must have gone wrong. What do we do now? I don't know about you, but I'm getting out of here, for good. Tom? Tom, you're free. You're going to be free! He's still the best lawyer in the house of Malloy. Thank you, senator. Now how's about a little drink on the house? What do you want, deary? Who do I see about a room? I'm sorry, deary, there ain't no rooms. We're all moving. There ain't no one left to handle the house. Billie! Winnie told us [inaudible] in our room. I thought you went? Well I'm back. Somebody's got to keep you dames from going off the deep end. Go on, go on, go on, show her my room. I'm taking Mrs. Barton's. If I'm digging in for the duration, I might as well do it in style. Don't be frightened. Everything will be all right. I've been here for seven and a half years waiting for George. So you see I know all the rules. I can help you. I... I want us to be friends. [music playing]
