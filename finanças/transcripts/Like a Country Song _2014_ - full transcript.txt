Just be happy I don't have you playing in a place like kimbros. - It's not far from it. - Look, I signed you because you're a great singer, but I need to know I can count on you to be at your shows.

Or these guys? - What... - Lizard skin or... - are you doing here? - Emu skin. Nice to see you too, Becca. Becca: What do you want? Jake: Looking at boots. You don't want boots. Look, I... I need to talk to you. Why? Why not? Gimme one good reason. Will you please leave? Becca, I'm just... Okay. Was that Jake reeson? Yes. He is so cute. How do you know Jake? Oh, I don't know him. I just played a show with him once. Oh, that's nice. Uh, how do you know Jake? Well, we used to date, actually... [screaming] It's not nice to sneak up on people. It's not nice to ask someone to leave when they're trying to talk to you, Becca. It's never been just talk with you. Just give me 60 seconds. How did you know I worked here? Bobby's sister told me. The answer is still no. - Why? - Well, I like to talk. - Hi, I'm Zoey. - Hey. - Zoey, no. - Hi. Because I know that you... Whoa, wait, why not? Because he... 'cause i... You need to go. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - No, really I don't. - She really doesn't. Mm-hmm. Well, I do. And she's my ride. - You drove today. - No, I didn't. - Yeah. - Yeah, mm-hmm. - She's right. - I'm pretty sure you did. You have a car in the parking lot. - Come on. - Bye, Jake. Are you crazy? He is hot. I know. I'm not gonna give up that easy. Suit yourself. Look, I want to make it up to you. You could never make it up to me. Someone once told me that everyone deserves a second chance. Fine. I'll accept your offer, but first you must do something with me. And what is that something? Meet me tomorrow and find out. - It's a date. - It's not a date. - Sounds like a date. - Forget it. Okay, okay. But if I go with you, then you have to let me take you out on a real date, dinner, a movie. - We can do coffee. - Coffee! - How about a beer or two? - Just coffee. - You used to be fun. - You used to be nice. - He's not nice? - Long story. Well, he looks nice. He's not. Where? Here, tomorrow. 4:00 P.M.. It's a date. I hope the food's good. It's not a date. But food will be served. He seems nice. [Giggling] [Instrumental music playing] [Knocking on door] Just a second. Can I help you? [Sighing] Bo? Hello, Mia. I just wanted to... No. Just go. Go away.

Come on. - Late for what? - Thanks for coming. - What's started? - Let's go. What are we eating? Are we eating somewhere? - Patience, Patience. - Okay. Oh, um... What? Oh, what's that for? Are you worried? Should I be? Guess you'll just have to trust me and see. How am I supposed to see? [Laughing] That's the point. How am I gonna drive? Well, give me your keys. - Oh, man. - C'mon. - Really? - Mm-hmm, c'mon. - Jump in. - All right. It's all about trust, my friend. - Yeah, all right. - All about trust. All right? Do you know how to drive one of these? [Laughs] I sure do. Just jiggle the key. I am jiggling it. [Engine starts] [Laughs] Ah, right. Jake: You were never this much fun. People change. [Jake laughing] Hey, so where are we eating? [Instrumental music playing] Smells good. Hey, can I take this... No, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Let me get ready first. Where are we? C'mon. Hey, this is not a place I would have picked for a date. Well, you made the deal. C'mon. We help feed lower income and homeless families once a week. So this is your idea of a date? I never said anything about a date. But you meant a date. I said food would be served. Which usually indicates a date. Fine, you want to leave? No. Hold on. You're right, we made the deal. So let's do this. Perfect. Oh. I have this for you. Oh, no, I'll wear the apron but you're not getting me to wear the hairnet. [Laughing] You have to wear the hairnet. It looks good. Okay. What are we doing here? Why don't you hand out the biscuits. I'll get the gloves for you. Becca: Here you are. Jake? Jake? I gotta go. I gotta go. What do you mean? I gotta go. Well, Jake... Seriously? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry about that. [Sighing] All right, white or dark? Dark. Hey, reg, got a second? Hey, Bo, come on in. [Elevator bell dings] Ain't had a drink in three days. That's good to hear. God's gonna give you strength, Bo. You just trust and believe. I'm tryin'. [Knocking on door] Reggie: Can I help you? Mia? My name's Reggie. Nice to meet you, Reggie. Mia, Bo's... Why don't I give you two a minute to talk. - Good to meet you, Mia. - You too. How did you find me? I called every motel in town. I'm glad you did. I'm just in town for this big concert thing. Then it's back out. I need to talk. Okay. It took me all these years to try and Bury all the bad memories I have of you. Seeing you the other day at my door, it was like I was experiencing them for the first time. When you first left, I prayed to god every day that he was gonna bring you back to us. We needed you so bad, especially our son. He would ask me every day, "when is my daddy coming home?" I was so lost when you abandoned us. And I didn't know what to say. After a while, I realized you were never coming home, so I told him that you were in heaven with god. It killed me to lie to him. And then my hope turned to bitterness and anger for what you did and it just continued to grow and eat me up inside. You were his whole world. It was a tragic accident. I'm so sorry... I was hoping you were not gonna say that. I know there's nothing I could ever say to take away the pain I caused. Nothing I can ever do to bring her back. I live with that moment every day. I finally just got... To the point where I realized... I had to give it to god. And now I can only hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I have tried many, many times, believe me, but I can't. You shouldn't be seeking my forgiveness. You should be seeking his. Mia, please. The only question that I wanted answered here today was why. Why? But after seeing you, it just doesn't matter anymore. I think he would be better off still thinking you were dead. I died a long time ago, in here. I guess, in a way, we both did. [Instrumental music playing] [Country music playing on stereo] - Thank you. - You boys still kind of have me at a fluster. You should ask her out. I mean, you're available and all, you know? [Laughing] Hey, man. [Laughing] How come we've never been to kimbros before? My old man used to play here. I never knew that.

I was driving home and I saw your truck parked outside. Why'd you take off? I couldn't deal with it. I had to get out of there. It brought back bad memories. Can we start over again? I don't know. That depends. I'm totally innocent. I'm not lying. I've heard that before. Hey, Bo. Good work today. Thanks. I got pizza coming. You hungry? Nah. I'm not here for that. You sure you're not hungry? No, thanks. But I might like to take you up on your offer. Okay, okay. Some of the guys here, we get together, keep each other strong. I could sure use some of that right about now.

Yeah, belt, definitely. Mm-hmm. So are you gonna tell me about it? Tell you about what? I know we haven't known each other that long, but it's obvious you two have a past. You and Jake. What happened? Nothing. Oh, come on. I broke up with him. Zoey: How long did you go out for? Three months, two days, and eleven hours. Beats my last relationship. He wanted every date to end up at his place. Yup, sounds like just about every guy I ever dated. [Sighing] Did you sleep with him? You did! Zoey. [Zoey laughs] That was my past. I'm different now. Zoey: Yeah, I get it. I never told anybody this, but, I dated this guy for a long time... And he really pressured me into it. It was a big mistake. Zoey: Anyway, why'd you guys break up? He cheated on me. What makes you think this time will be different? Everybody deserves a second chance. Right? [Laughing] - Becca: Maybe? - Yeah, okay, fine. Well, you saw him.

You take one, he'll take two. I'm sure he'll call. I've been texting for two days and he hasn't texted back. Well, did you try going by his house? I'm afraid of what I'd see. Call him from my phone. Why would I do that? No, that's not right. Him not calling you isn't right. Girl: Hey, you want some coffee? I'm good. [Cell phone ringing] Hey, your phone's ringing. Who is it? It's just a number.

You just checked out on me... And buried yourself in that stupid nursery. I did not just check out on you. Yeah, you did. [Sighing] What's this? They're from your father. What? He sent them to you every year. What are you talking about? He didn't die. What did you just say? You said he was killed in a car accident. Jake, I told you that, so that you wouldn't... You lied to me about my father dying? I know, I was just trying to... Where is he? Where is he living? I don't know. Well, how do you know he isn't dead? 'Cause he came by the house. When? Mia: Just a few days ago. Why didn't you tell me? Jake, I am trying to do that right now. - Where is he? - You've been drinking. I just don't... I don't think it's a good idea. You don't decide when I get to see him. Jake, please. Tell me, where is he? You're hurting me. Where is he? Bo, you feel ready to share with us tonight? Whatever it is. When I was living inside that bottle, even though I believed that Christ had died for my sins and Rose again, and I truly believed I was forgiven, I refused to let go of the pain, until a friend of mine told me one day, he said... He said, "Reggie, you've got to forgive you." It's like this horrible dream... That plays over and over in my head. No matter how hard I try to make it stop, I just can't. Bo: I'd been pushing myself that week, working a couple of double shifts, trying to make ends meet. It was my son's birthday and I'd promised him a new fishing pole. I forgot my keys in the house, so I jumped out of the truck to run in and get 'em. Came back out, and there sat Lily. She wanted to go. I want to go, daddy. Bo: I'm gonna be right back. She just smiled. I said, "baby, you can't go. "I don't have your car seat." She just had a way of looking at me through those eyes that I just couldn't say no to. [Tires screeching] [Crashing] [Bo sighs] Bo: She was only five years old. It was all my fault. [Screaming] Bo: Everything changed that day. I didn't want to live anymore. I started drinking, abusing drugs, verbally abusing my wife and my son. Every time I looked at Mia, I could see it in her eyes, blame, hatred. I still hear my boy calling out, "where's Lily, daddy? "Where'd she go?" What kind of a father could I have been to my son? Leaving my wife and my boy was the hardest thing I ever did. But I honestly thought they'd be better off without me. Bo: Now I realize that was a big mistake. [Bo sighs] I miss 'em. I swear to god, I miss 'em. I miss 'em so much. Jake? Jake, I'm sorry. Jake! I'm sorry, buddy. Come here. Jake! Jake, please, I need to talk to you. - How could you? - It was a mistake. How could you just leave? I'm sorry. What are you sorry for, old man? Sorry for abandoning me when I was nine years old? Sorry for my mom getting drunk and crying herself to sleep every night? Sorry for me growing up without a dad, thinking he was dead, and watching all my friends do things with their dads? You have no idea what sorry is. I'm just asking you to forgive me. Would forgiving you bring my sister back? Would it? Son, I want to... I am not your son. Now you listen to me, old man. You stay away from my mother and me. Do you understand me? Do you? You'll never be my father. My father is dead. Jake, please! Jake! [Instrumental music playing] [Knocking on door] [Knocking on door] It's open. Hey, you okay? What are you doing here? Becca: Um... Well, I came to say goodbye. And to give you this. I'm leaving to Haiti for two months, next week. Haiti? But you just got back. Well, they still need help. Look, whatever you're going through, Jake, I want you to know that... That I care and that god cares and that... [scoffing] God. You're kidding me, right? What god? The god that loves you. You really believe that? Yes, I do, with all my heart. What do you know about real pain, Becca? You're just a good little church girl now, who's gonna wind up marrying some good little church boy one day and living happily ever after. There's something I never told you. Um... When we were living in Nashville after my father died, my momma flipped out and, uh... And I started using every kind of drug I could get a hold of. When my mom found out, she said I could get help, or she was kicking me out of the house. And so being the angry person that I was, I just did more and more drugs. And then one day when I was already high, I just wanted to end it all. But just before I cut my wrists, I said a prayer... Asking god to forgive me. And he answered... 'Cause I heard a voice that said, "you need to ask god to save you." So, do I believe in a god that loves me, that loves you, all of us? Yeah, I do. And I hope that one day you do too. [Sniffles] Goodbye, Jake. [Door closing] I... I saw my dad the other day.

[Groaning] Jake: Well, did you hear anything? I mean, I assume you can still hear when you play, right? This is not happening, right now. So what do you think? [Scoffs] I think I'm in the twilight zone. No, I mean about my song. Oh, sorry, man, I don't like hymns. My name's buck. Yeah. You know, you look like... Larry gatlin? Boy has a face of an angel. [Chuckles] I get it all the time. No, not Larry gatlin. You look like... What am I doing? Talking to some guy who's singing in the dark. You know, singing's a mighty powerful thing. It's a god-given talent. Wait... I'm not dead, am I? You came pretty close, by the looks of you. Yeah. Sometimes I wish I was. What are you doing here? Just passing through. No, I saw you twice last week. You're not just passing through. Well, my work's just not all quite done yet. What do you do? Whatever it takes. Huh. - I'm Jake. - I know who you are. I've seen you perform. You're real good. [Scoffs] Who cares? All things were made by him. And through him. [Scoffs] What does that mean? Well, it means that god has given our talents, so we'll bring him the glory. Great. So you're another one of those weirdo preacher guys. No. No, I'm just trying to help out. Yeah, well, how about you help out by tracking down those guys that stole my stuff. Just material things. I heard that before. Buck: Well, that's true. Easy for you to say, man. You got your boots. What are you doing here anyway? Just singing my song. To who? Anybody who needs to hear it. Oh... [Chuckles] Kinda hard to perform in the dark, huh? Pretty hard to do anything when you're in the dark. Yeah. [Buzzing] [Instrumental music playing] Bo: Are you ready for your present? Happy birthday, son. Thank you, daddy.

Why didn't you ever tell me the truth about him? You would ask me every day, "where's my daddy? "Where's Lily?" I just... it killed me to see what it was doing to you and I didn't know what to do, so I thought I did what was right. I thought that if you thought that they were both together in heaven, that you would eventually be okay with that. I know now that I was wrong. I don't like who I am anymore, mom. And I can't help but think that if... If my father had have been there all those years that I'd be a different person, that I'd be a better man. It's never too late to change. Yeah. I really just tried to protect us both. Jake, please, forgive me. Please. After Lily died, your dad was just a broken man and all he did was drink. You don't remember what it was like. But he loved me. I do remember that. Yes. He loved you very much. That's why I sing. Can you forgive me? I'll try. [Instrumental music playing] Hey, Lily. Jake: Sorry I haven't been to see you in a while. We love you. I love you, baby. [Music continues] Hey, Jake, how you doing? Good. I'm here to see my dad. Your father isn't here, son. I thought he was staying here. The tour's moving on to Houston. He decided not to join us. He left early this morning. Oh. You know where he was going? He didn't say. Your dad's a good man, Jake. And he loves you very much. You know, forgiveness is a powerful thing. To give and to receive. Thank you. You bet. Good luck out there. All right. Take care. [Knocking on door] Ugh. Huh, looking good. She's getting ready to leave, so... I just came to say goodbye. Well, I don't think she wants to see you. No, I also wanted to apologize to you, for the other night. I was out of line. I'm sorry. [Sighing] I accept. All right, fine, you can come in. Becca. - Hey. - What happened? I got what was coming to me. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything, hurting your feelings, coming on too strong, shutting you out. You know, you can stop me at any time. [Laughing] Hopefully, I can see you when you get back? Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea. I was hoping you weren't gonna say that. I really am sorry. And I know I've been wrong, but... I'm asking you forgive me. I mean, I do forgive you and I believe you're sorry. It's just you were right when you said we both know this isn't gonna work. No, no. I didn't know what I was saying. I was an angry person then, I'm not now. Look, I just don't think... Look, I know what I want... And it's you. It's you. [Sighing] We're just not in the same place right now, Jake. I'm sorry. Okay. Well, I know you've got to start packing, so... Yeah. Have a great trip. Thanks. Oh, I almost forgot. What's this? Some going away music. Hey... I'm really gonna miss you. Hey. It's only gonna be two months. [Chuckles] Yeah. I suppose. You have a god-given talent, Jake. You're gonna do great. Thanks. [Door closing] [Instrumental music playing] Looks like you could use a hand. Yeah, 'cause I've been pulling your weight. I'm really sorry. You'll be more sorry if you don't grab a bag and get to work. Yeah. I got two of them. Watch this. Yeah, yeah. [Laughing] Is that it? It is. It's good to see you. You too. I missed hanging. Yeah.
