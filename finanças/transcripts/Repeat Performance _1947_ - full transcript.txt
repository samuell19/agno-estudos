"The stars look down on New Year's eve in New York." "They say that fate is in the stars." "That each of our years is planned ahead." "And nothing can change destiny." "Is that true?" "How many times have you said .." "I wish I could live this year over again?" "This is the story of a woman who did relive one year of her life." "It's almost midnight." "And that's where our story begins." Well. - Hello. Hi, Sheila. Ah, it's about time, Mrs Page. The old year couldn't wait. It just left. William, I've got to see you. Right away. Sheila. Sheila, darling. Not even a happy new year. I'm cold. You simply can't take William off just like that. But please come with me, William. I've got to talk to you, alone. Oh well, if you put it that way. I'll just take this with me and .. One for Sheila. For me .. for you. And it's on Paula. Sheila, is that a nightgown you're wearing? What are we doing, Lady Macbeth? Are you two going to have a party and not including me? I promised John Friday I'd come to his party but I'm open to a better offer. Bess. Please go back to Paula. Alright. I like Paula. Of course, I can see why you don't like her but then I've never had a husband. I've got nothing Paula wants. Right now, you've got nothing we want so disappear. You wanted my sparkling burgundy. You can have it back. And right in your face if you don't scram. Get rid of her, William. Alright, alright. I'll go. But listen. Don't wait for Barney. He won't show up on time. He never does. You ought to know that. Bess should never be allowed to drink. Bess should never be allowed. Bess should never be .. - William. Stop it, please. Something dreadful has happened. Is it Barney? What's he done now? William. Barney is dead. Dead? I shot him. I killed him. I shot him with this. In her right hand, the smoking revolver. Only they don't smoke any more, do they. It's the new powder or something. He's lying on the floor where I shot him. I didn't want to leave him like that. There was someone at the door. Pounding at the door. What am I going to do, William? Shall I call the police? Heavens, no. They'd only arrest you for murder. They have such one-track minds. You'd better see John Friday. John's giving a party. I can't see him. We'll see him alone. He'll know what to do. Come on. I'll get my coat, Sheila. You're coming with me, aren't you? - If you want me to. "Yes? Who is it?" It's Sheila, John. Sheila. "Well, come right up." I wish it had been me that shot Barney. I would have, if you'd asked me, Sheila. Dear William. You've had a bad year too, haven't you? A terrible year. It hasn't been good. I wish we could live it over again. If we only could. I wouldn't make the same mistakes. One thing. I wouldn't go to London. And Barney would never meet Paula. The whole horrible thing could have been avoided .. Just by not going to London a year ago. You didn't know that, Sheila. I do now. It's like a play. We're out of town trying it out and we find the third act is wrong. So it's rewritten. All different. Play it over again until it is right. Fine. That's what I'd like to do, William. Rewrite it. Play it over again. But I can't. It is too late. Yes, Sheila. It is too late. People do live things over. Haven't you ever entered a strange room and felt that you had been there before? You knew it was impossible. Yet everything in the room looked familiar. Hasn't that ever happened to you, William? William? William, where are you? Where are you? "William won't answer." "William is gone." "He was there just a moment ago." "In that moment, time stopped for Sheila." "Time ran backwards." "She made a wish." "A tragic one, at a magic time." "When the new year was beginning." "And now that wish is coming true." "She's going to live the old year all over again." "Sheila doesn't know that." "Not yet." "But she will .. very soon." Sheila. Happy new year. Come in, come in. I'm glad you stopped by. I want to have a little talk. You can also tie this tie. I've just about given it up. John. Where are the others? You are having a party, aren't you? Oh, no. Just you and Barney are giving a party. I was just about to call Barney. Oh no, you can't. I mean you mustn't. Now that you are here, I won't need to. How was the benefit? I'm sorry I didn't get down to see you. How did it go? What's the matter, Sheila? Everything. You haven't given up London, have you? You are still going, I mean? London? - I think London will do you good. I still haven't found a play you like. You keep on turning them down. I'm doing a play right now. 'Say Goodbye' by Paula Costello. Paula who? That's not a bad title: 'Say Goodbye'. You mean you're reading it? I'm playing in it. Say, what is this? A joke? John, don't do this to me. Don't play games. Alright, but suppose we stop pretending that Barney ever finishes his new play. John, stop it. Stop talking like this. That was last year. That was last year and the year before that. Barney's play was always 'about ready'. He'll never finish it and you've got to face that. Here .. let me take your coat. I'll fix you something to drink. Well. That is a stunning dress. I'll have to take a better look at that, Sheila. This gown is a year old. I haven't worn it for months. John, what's happening? This isn't right. I don't understand. What time is it? I mean, what's the date? 1946, darling. It has been for over half an hour. No, you mean 1946 is through. This is 1947. No. 1946 is just beginning. What on earth is the matter? What's wrong, Sheila? John .. something has happened. I don't know exactly how but it's happened. This is 1946. A whole year ago. It is 1946, yes. Then I am giving a party. I remember now. And I bought this dress because Barney likes me in white. I'm wearing the sapphires he gave me for Christmas. John, this is 1946. Well, at last we get the truth. I thought that was a new dress. Happy new year, Sheila. Happy 1946. I've got to go. I've got to go home. Well, wait a minute. I'll take you. - No. I've got to go alone. Oh, I wish I could tell you what's happened. And I couldn't make you believe it. I won't believe it myself unless .. Oh John, I've got to go home. I've got to know. Barney. Barney! Barney. Sheila. I had just described you on the phone to a very tiresome man at the city morgue. Barney. Hold me close, Barney. Closer. I've got to know you're really here. I am really in your arms. Hold me tight, darling. Tighter. Don't let me go. It's really you, isn't it Barney? It's really you. I'm really in your arms. You are alive. Alive? I haven't had a drink if that's what you mean. Oh Barney. If I'm dreaming don't wake me up. Don't let anyone wake me up. There. Were you ever kissed like that in a dream? Once more. I'm still unconvinced. You really did have me worried, you know. It serves me right I suppose for the times I've worried you. See, I beat you to that retort. That isn't what I was going to say at all. What were you going to say? I think it was .. I love you. That's good. A bit hackneyed but always good. Ah, what's this? A new gown? Do you like it? It's beautiful. It is beautiful and lucky. Lucky? To have you inside it. Come here. Ah .. I still feel as though I am dreaming. Is this the way it was a year ago? Let me think. What are you mumbling about? Oh Barney. I'm suddenly so happy. I don't remember being this happy before. You'll get used to it. It's going to be a very happy year. You know, I feel sort of naughty. As though we just met and you've asked me to your apartment and I've accepted. As I remember, that's the way it was. Not at all. I held out for weeks. Very proper. - Hmm. Barney? - Huh? I wish we hadn't asked all those people to breakfast. So do I. Let's have a drink before they get here. - A drink? A toast to the new year. Between the two of us. Of course. It is New Year. That funny face of yours. How well I know that look. Barney's about to drink again. Oh, it isn't that at all. You can have a drink. No, Sheila. I insist. Just one. It's New Year. No darling. Remember me? I'm the guy who can't take just one. You ought to drink a toast with something. I had some ginger ale sent in. Beautiful, sparkling ginger ale. Vintage 1945. What did you do at the Benefit tonight? The benefit? - Uhuh. A scene from 'Out Of The Blue'. My play? You didn't? - But I did. Oh, that was very gracious of you. And generous. Nonsense. The audience loved it. Remembered it and loved it. It was a great play, Barney. It was alright in its day. I've done better since. Always, they ask me when I'm going to write another 'Out Of The Blue'. The idiots. Do they know you only write that once? You'll write another soon. This year. No pep talks, please. Spare me that. They liked it, huh? Yes, Barney. They remembered it? Yes, Barney. I wonder if they remember that Out Of The Blue made a star of Sheila Page? I'm sorry, darling. Hmm. It's really quite good. Very refreshing. It's like kissing a girl through a plate-glass window. I'm glad I'm not giving up love. - I'm glad of that, too. I guess I might as well let them in. - Let me straighten that tie. No. Why? These people all know me. I hope. Hello, John. - Hello, Sheila. I'm sorry I'm late but I couldn't find a taxi. That tie. I shouldn't have deserted you. I was at your apartment earlier this evening, wasn't I? You certainly were. I just wanted to make sure. Things are a little mixed up with me. Everything alright now? - I think so, John. I hope so. - Good. Barney's in there somewhere. - I'll find him. This is it. The party's on. Come on in. Hello, Bess. - Hi. Be careful with those skins. One of them is still alive. She loves me. She .. You know, this works much better if you have no-one in mind. She loves me not. She loves me. William, will you be serious for a moment? I must ask you something. Do you remember being with me about two hours ago? Only .. Only somehow, it was a year from now. I haven't seen you since Christmas, Sheila. Did I thank you for that shower-cap? It was exactly what I wanted. But that was a year ago. This party. Everything. It was a year ago. I know what's ahead for all of us. You are going to be committed to an insane asylum. I always thought that was the logical end for me. William. You must avoid a woman named Mrs Shaw. Why, Sheila? She is the one who will have you committed. Promise me you'll have nothing to do with Mrs Shaw. That will be easy. I don't know a Mrs Shaw. William. You don't think I'm mad, do you? Mad? No. No more than the average person. I am, you know. Much madder than average. Oh, Barney. I love your parties. You meet such nice furs. Hello Hillgardner. Happy new year. - Happy new year, Barney. This is Mrs Shaw. Barney Page - Eloise Shaw. - Mrs Shaw. You are Sheila Page's husband, aren't you? Yep. How does it feel to be married to such a glamorous star? It's absolute heaven. Are you an actor too? No, I'm a caddy. I carry Sheila's clubs. Barney. Mrs Shaw is very much interested in my operetta. Oh, is that so? Well, I hear it's great. Anyone who puts money in that show makes a wise investment. That's just what I was thinking of doing. No? - Yes. Come along, Eloise. Now who is that? I've seen that young man's face before. Of course. It's William Williams, the poet. I knew it. I saw his picture in a review of literature. I said at the time. That sensitive face. That bone structure. It's bony alright. Excuse me. I've got to meet that poet. If only I had loved your flesh. And cared less to lead love where it fell. It might be I could live afresh. And love as lightly and as well with little more to tell. My goodness. Who are you? And where did you learn that poem? From your own book, William Williams: 'Songs From The Solar Plexus'. Are you bringing out another book of poems, Mr Williams? That's all I've done, bringing them out. But publishers keep bringing them back. Have you ever thought of having them published privately? On vellum. Morocco bound. Illuminated. That's rather expensive, isn't it? Oh, merely a matter of money if we must be vulgar. Well, if we must, we must. By the way, my name is Shaw. Mrs Eloise Shaw. How do you do, Mrs Shaw. How do you do. Shaw? - Yes. Mrs Shaw. Tell me. Do you know Sheila Page? No. I know of her, of course. - But you've never met her? No, I haven't. Why? She knows you. She told me all about you, I mean. My goodness. Excuse me. I think I hear the doorbell. Oh. Oh, I say. I'm terribly sorry. I've come up one floor too many. Yes. This is the seventh, isn't it? - Yes, yes. Come in. Come in. Happy new year and all that sort of thing. Oh no. No thank you. Really. You're so kind, but .. Nonsense. No-one is turned away from the Pages' door. There is always room for one more beautiful person. And my name is Williams. William Williams. Oh. Well. I'm Paula Costello. I didn't get you anything for Christmas, Barney. But it is never too late. Paula Costello - Barney Page. How do you do. I'm awfully sorry, Mr Page. I really didn't mean to crash your party. I am supposed to be at the Winklers downstairs. Very good friends of ours. We often share parties. Our guests overflow into their place and .. Vice-versa. Would you like a drink? Think I should? This is my fourth party. - Of course you should. John. Mr Friday - Miss Costello. William stole her from the Winklers' party. I never get invited to the right parties. Well, thank you. I can't pretend I don't know who you are, Mr Page. Your 'Out Of The Blue' was a great success in London. I loved it. Thank you. I suppose you are plagued by people asking for another Out Of The Blue? I am. Well, fool them and write a comedy. There were touches in your play that indicated a great gift for comedy. That's exactly what I'm doing. Well .. then we think alike. We most certainly do. Shall we drink to that? Paula. And there I was at the airport saying goodbye to Bertie. And someone discovered it was a cancellation. So, we tossed to see who would go with him. And I won. Paula, come and meet your host. It's Sheila Page. I'd love to. Sheila Page? I've heard of her. I'm looking forward to meet her. Paula, this is Sheila Page. - How do you do? Sheila Page. Barney Page? Then this charming man must be your husband? Yes. This charming man is my husband. I hope you will forgive me crashing your party, Mrs Page. Your husband has been so sweet about it. What are you doing in New York? You're supposed to be in London. Well, I was just explaining to your husband. There was a cancellation. It was just a silly whim. Paula really belongs at the Winklers downstairs. She came up one floor too many. Won't the Winklers be worried? Yes. I'm afraid they will. I set out alone to look at your Greenwich Village. But I can't imagine why you call it a village. Don't look at me. I didn't name it. I hope you enjoy London, Mrs Page. Sheila isn't going to London. She is staying here to do a play for me. Oh, what a disappointment. For London, I mean. But it won't be a play written by you, Miss Costello. Dear me, I shouldn't think so. I've no intention of writing one for you. So, you are a playwright? Well, I've had one mild success in London. You've been most kind Mr Page. Mr Friday and Mr Williams. Goodnight, Mrs Page. I'll see you to the door. She is lying. She has written a new play. She came here because she knew John Friday was our guest. She came here quite by accident, Sheila. And I must say, you were unaccountably rude to her. I like to ask people to my parties. - Oh, nonsense. There's at least half a dozen people here you didn't ask. The genius Mrs Shaw. That girl from .. - Mrs Shaw? Eloise Shaw? She's here? Don't be rude to her. She's backing Hillgardner's new operetta. How did you know so much about Paula Costello? Yes. How did you know she wrote plays? You're drinking, Barney. - So what? You said I could have just one. This is just one. William, have you met Mrs Shaw? Yes, I have. I meant to ask you about her. She's never met you. How do you know so much about her? What's it all about, Sheila? Why were you so rude to Paula Costello? What's wrong, Sheila? - Yes, Sheila, what's wrong? Nothing is wrong. Go on with the party. Don't let me spoil things. I'll see if everything is ready in the kitchen. Can I help? - There is nothing to do, really. Mattie has got everything started. I behaved very badly in there. But Paula Costello turning up like that .. As if to say .. 'You can't escape me just by not going to London'. You knew her name before anybody mentioned it, Sheila. You knew that she wrote plays. And for some reason, you don't like her. I have a very good reason, William. Paula is part of what I tried to tell you in there. You are afraid of her? Yes. I thought if we stayed in New York, Barney would never meet her, but .. What do I do now? I won't believe this year is laid out for me like a pattern .. And nothing can change it. I've got to change it. I've got to. Do you understand? I don't know, Sheila. But I'll try. If you want me to .. I'll try. Wouldn't you like to sit this one out? It isn't polite for the host to drink too much at his own party. This is not my party. These are all your friends. With the possible exception of maybe two people, they're all your crummy friends. You were very rude Sheila to the only interesting person who turned up .. At this crummy party. So she went away. I'm sorry, Barney. May I have a drink? I haven't had one. - Oh, no. No. That won't work. This is my drink. It's not my liquor as I'm on the wagon. But it's my drink because I made it. I created it. I'm a creative artist, Sheila. Or didn't you know that? We'll be serving breakfast soon. You don't need another drink. It's too early for breakfast. The party is only just getting under way. All over New York city, parties are just getting under way. Downstairs at the Winklers there is a beautiful party just getting under way. Would you like to drop in on the Winklers, Sheila? No, Barney. I wouldn't. What kind of New Year spirit is that? That's your trouble, Sheila. No spirit. And you want to know something else? You're no fun. Bess, would you like to drop in on the Winklers downstairs? They're having a wonderful party. Have they got any sparkling Burgundy? - Gallons of it. Ah, that's for me. Come on, Virgil. Bess .. please don't. Pay no attention to my wife, Bess. She's had too much to drink and is becoming unmanageable. You know, Bess. You're the only true friend I've got. The only true friend in all the world. Well? Shall I ask Mattie to serve breakfast, Sheila? Please, William. Do you want to talk, Sheila? Barney will fall in love with that woman, William. He'll go on drinking. Become a hopeless alcoholic. He'll grow to hate me. He'll try to kill me. I've got to escape all that, William. There is a new rocket plane that flies faster than the speed of sound. It escapes the roar of its own engines. Last year began with Paula Costello. This one has begun the same. But I can't have it end the same. I've got to get Barney out of New York. Where can I go to escape from everything? Where? Barney. It was a beautiful party. And I had a beautiful time. I'm glad you did. Did you wish the Winklers a happy new year for me? Many times. Many times. And for William too. And for Friday. For everybody. That involved quite a bit of drinking but what could I do? That is right. What could you do? You're very understanding, Sheila. Yes. I'm very understanding. I don't deserve you, Sheila. That's right. You don't deserve me. In some ways of course, you don't deserve me. That evens it up very nicely. Very nicely. I think, now I'd like to go to bed. That's a splendid idea. Goodnight, William. You are the only true friend I've got. That's embarrassing because I don't like you. I don't like you at all. Barney. I've got wonderful news for you. Wonderful news. We're not going to London, you know. I know. But we're not staying in New York. We're not staying in New York. We're going to California. California? Let me take your coat. I'll call to the airport. We can leave tonight and be in California at dawn. I don't think I like California. What's wrong with it? It's a wonderful place. Yes, Sheila. California is wonderful. If you are a grapefruit. There you are. - Hello, darling. Just having breakfast? - Yes. Then I'll have lunch. Is that a subtle reminder than I've slept late again? No, of course not. There's a lot of mail this morning. A couple of telegrams. A letter from Bess Michaels. And from William. A bill from the Village Den. Oh, and a play from John Friday. I hope it is better than the last one. The wire is from Friday. He's flying out. He'll be with us tonight. I'd better read this afternoon and be prepared for him. Good morning Mrs Page, Mr Page. - Morning, Tony. We're famished. Breakfast for me and lunch for Mrs Page. We don't know what we want. Surprise us, will you. Yes, sir. Tony, how long have you been out here in California? Twelve years, sir. I've only been here twelve weeks. Tell me, Tony. Do you ever long for civilization? Civilization? - Do you miss it? Do you miss the women, Tony? Pale women who wear skirts and hats. Remember them? Oh yes, sir. It is April in New York. The snow is melting and the gutters are muddy. A taxi cab is splashing your best suit. The flowerbeds in the Plaza are bursting with tulips. All colors. Everyone has a cold in the nose. The animals are out in Central Park Zoo. Oh, that smell. Tony .. what is that awful odour? Orange blossoms, sir. I'm sorry. Bess wants us to send her a case of California burgundy. Here's a book by William. His book. 'Poems by William Williams'. Morocco bound. On vellum. Illuminated. 'To Eloise'. It is dedicated to Eloise. Who is that? Mrs Shaw. It's happened. Even though I warned him. It's happened. Hello. Here's a poem called: 'To Sheila'. 'If you would flee from fate'. 'First, learn to flee from your shadow under the full moon'. 'If you would run from destiny'. 'First, learn to run through snow leaving no footprints'. Now, why would he dedicate that to you? 'Run through snow, leaving no footprints'. Is that you, darling? Yes, Barney. So, at last you've seen the inside of a movie studio, huh? Fascinating. I don't know why I held out so long. Let's have dinner staying in. I was invited to three cocktail parties. But I hurried home just to be with you. Here is your reward. I was expecting a more elaborate kiss than that. I can't afford it just now. Ask about our easy-payment plans. Sheila. I've got wonderful news for you. Yes, what? I've just finished reading the most remarkable play. Really? That good? Far better than that. Really fine writing. And a whale of a part in it for you. So Friday finally found something. A good meaty drama. Critic's awards stuff. You play an actress. I play an actress? Barney. What is the title? It's called: 'Say Goodbye'. What's wrong, Sheila? Who wrote it? Whose name is on that play? There isn't any name on it. I wondered about that. Friday left the name off purposely. I won't play it, Barney. You won't play it? I don't like the title. It's an unlucky word: 'Goodbye'. The title can be changed. You know that. I don't like playing an actress. I've always felt that way. Why, for heaven's sake? They are not real people, actresses. Audiences don't like them. Nonsense. Wait until you read this. It's the private life of an actress. No backstage stuff at all. I suppose she has a husband? Yes, it takes place in Paris. The second act is in Italy. Where she goes with the other man, no doubt. Yeah. How did you know? Well, those things always have the same plot. The plot doesn't matter in this. It is a story of character. You're only off the stage for 6 minutes. There's never been such a part. You could play it forever. - I won't play in it at all. Sheila, I consider that a very unreasonable attitude. Really? - Yes. Unreasonable and stupid. Have you any respect for my judgement? - How about my judgement? Darling, you're only a woman. You're not meant to have judgement or intelligence. But I do have intuition. I know instinctively this role is wrong for me. If you won't play this, I don't know what you will play. A play like this doesn't turn up every day. It might. I might be rehearsing a play by my husband. If Barney Page would spend more time writing plays instead of reading them. Oh. I'm sorry, Barney. I shouldn't have said that. I was angry for a moment. That's when we say what we really mean. When we're angry. It's been inside of you quite a while. It's out now. Feel better? I said I was sorry, Barney. You would like another play from me, wouldn't you? All this fine talk about what it would mean for me. But you are making sure there is a big fat part in it for you. You would do anything to get another Out Of The Blue, wouldn't you? You'd even stay another 3 months in this sun-kissed purgatory if that would help. Wouldn't you? - Barney, don't. It isn't like that at all. You've got it all wrong. I haven't had a drink in 3 months. I'm burnt so brown by that devilish sun I don't know myself in the mirror. I'm so healthy I stink. And it's all your fault. What are you trying to make of me? I'm going out to try and undo a little of your dirty work. Who's there? Sheila, it is John. John Friday. Hello John. - Hello. Pardon me. Hello? Barney. Oh, I can't imagine. Now, how would I know of a late spot? We can have a drink here. Come home. Friday has just arrived. Yes. It's Barney. He's on his way home. Well, have you read the play? I came right up on the heels of it. Couldn't wait. You had it all nicely timed, didn't you? I'd just be finishing the last act as you walked in. I rush into your arms. 'John, it's divine. When do rehearsals start'? Yes. I am afraid it was something of that sort. I thought so. Well, I won't play it, John. You won't play it? But .. It's a great play, Sheila. - Yes, I know. Is that why you left off the author's name? I saved that as a sort-of surprise. Really? I do love surprises. Let's have it. Paula Costello. Sit down, John. Thank you. I'm sorry. I can't pretend to be astonished. I knew it was Paula Costello. You knew? Oh, but you couldn't have. Yes, I knew. And I say now what I've said before. I will not play in anything written by that woman. I don't like her. She's dangerous. She can only be dangerous by transatlantic cable. What do you mean? - Paula went back to London. Back to London? Yes. They are making a movie of her first play. It will .. keep her there quite a while. No, I can't do it. I won't do that woman's play no matter where she is. Not even if she's in London? - But she won't stay in London. Oh, that could be arranged. John. Will you give me your word that Paula Costello will stay away from New York .. During the entire run of the play? You have my word. Now. Shall I go out and come in again? Why? - So you can read that line: 'John, it's divine. When do rehearsals start'? You must think me an utter fool. - No, Sheila. I think I understand. A touching scene. Very touching. Hello, Barney. Hello. Barney, I'm going to do the play. You were right about it. It's a splendid part for me. So, dear old John was able to talk you into it. How did you get around her, Friday? Tell me your secrets. It might be a handy thing for a husband to know, huh? The play did it. By the way, I've got Bess Michaels for the maid. And I'm out here to sign Bob Randall for the husband. Bob Randall? Fancy that, Sheila? Playing opposite a movie star. Wonderful. Well .. I think I'll run along. We can talk more about this tomorrow. Can you two be ready to leave in a week? - We can leave at sunrise tomorrow. There. I have made a decision. Do you mind terribly, Sheila? I'll see you in the morning. I never did like California. But tonight was the pay-off. Tonight they went too far with me. Do you know what time they close the bars in this state? 12 o'clock. Barney. Don't you want to know who the author is? The author of 'Say Goodbye'. I don't want to hear anything about it. Who is it? Paula Costello. - Costello? That English girl who crashed our New Year's party. Oh yes. As I remember, you were jealous of her because she took a fancy to me. I considered her dangerous. You'll have to get over that notion, Sheila. That women are dangerous just because they are attractive. You admit she's attractive then? - She's more than that. She's gorgeous, enchanting. And judging from her play. Extremely talented. Come here. Don't you realise the same words describe you? 'Gorgeous', 'enchanting', 'talented'. I've got all those words wrapped up in a cute little package labelled .. My wife. Now let's go back to the beginning and do it once more. Once more and I'll fall apart. Last year, I did a play with just two actors. Next year I'll do one with just scenery. Well, Mr Friday. How is the rehearsal going? Having trouble? - Yes. It's the second act, Mrs Shaw. - The second act? Dear me. I must admit I didn't quite understand it but I thought it was lovely. Was it bad? The local critics seem to think so. Well, it was most impolite of them to say so. We shouldn't bring plays to this town anyway. I never did like New Haven. Except for those Yale boys. They're nice. Doesn't William look elegant? Stand up straighter, darling. That crape is no good if you slouch. Mrs Shaw, please. We are trying to rehearse. Really? Is there anything I can do? No. - No. Oh. My goodness. Come along, William. Let's go someplace where we can watch. John, you must listen to me. I know I'm right. I've known it from the start. This act will work if we play it backwards. We've tried everything else. How do you we do it? It's a little complicated. Bob arrives in Italy as soon as the curtain goes up. Bess doesn't bring the letter until the final scene. I say goodbye to Ricardo in the first scene. And Bob comes in before the letter. She's right, Friday. That is the way to play it. Do we just read our speeches backwards? That's how you read most of yours last night. Oh, were you here? I thought I was grand. I'm no writer, you know. And the author is in London. Perhaps Barney could fix it? Let's try it ourselves, John. It just means juggling the lines. Barney drove to New York this morning. Incidentally, the Guild is interested in his new play. He's probably there right now discussing production. Hello everybody. Barney. Hello. I've got a wonderful surprise for all of you. Tonight there will be cries of Author! Author! And do you know what? The author will be here. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Paula Costello. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Well. I say, what an enthusiastic reception. The play must be worse than I thought it was. What are you doing here, Paula? I sent for her. We needed her. Paula's got a new second act. Hmm .. and here it is. The trick is, to play the whole thing backwards. You see, the husband arrives in Italy the minute the curtain goes up. The maid doesn't bring the letter until the final scene. Sheila says goodbye to Ricardo in the very first scene. And the husband comes in before the letter. See? What's the matter? It works. Believe me. We believe you, Paula. Well, Sheila. What do you say, huh? Oh dear, we're not in for another scene, are we? I'll talk to her. You shouldn't have come, Paula. - Why not? Barney .. Mr Page .. asked me. Mr Page has nothing to do with my show. He just happens to be married to my star. Yes .. isn't that unfortunate. And what may I ask, do you think you are doing? I'm leaving the play, Barney. Friday will have to find someone else. You can't do that, Sheila. We got bad notices. It isn't the little gem we thought it was. It reads better than it plays. I couldn't afford to open in New York. Better to leave now before it's too late. Oh, stop it. Stop making ridiculous excuses. It's Paula Costello and you know it. Go on, Mattie. Leave that. Go and get a drink. Disappear, will you. Why did you do it, Barney? Why did you send for Paula? Sheila, I'm going to make an absurd promise to you. Absurd, because it will be so easy to keep. If it will make you happy, I promise never to see Paula Costello again. I sent for her as I sincerely believed the play needed her. But she means nothing to me, personally. Nothing. Do you know what we talked about all the way up here? You. Just you. Even when you stopped for a drink? Alright, we had a drink or two. Does that prove anything? Paula is no more interested in me than I am in her. If you weren't so blind you'd see why she came so readily when I cabled her. What do you mean? - Friday. John Friday. You kept them apart, Sheila. With that ultimatum you gave him in California. Impossible. Paula and John? Why not? He's only human. He can't go through life being a big brother to everyone. I wish I could believe you. Have you ever tried? Very hard? Oh, Barney. Come here. I'm sorry, Sheila. I kept my end of the bargain. You didn't have to send for Paula, Barney. Your wife saved the play all by herself. - Yeah? I bet you're glad Paula is here just the same. It's alright, John. Everything is alright now. Come along, darling. We'll be ducking out right after the curtain tonight. See you at the New York opening. Well, I don't know what's the matter with it. Maybe I shouldn't have tried to write a comedy. Before another Producer turns it down. I've got to fix this triangle scene. Oh? What's wrong with it? The woman's viewpoint. If a woman is after a man, she just doesn't behave this way. Well, how would she behave? Well. If they're alone together in his apartment. She wouldn't spend that much time. Working on the manuscript of his play. Paula. You're wonderful. Now you're beginning to get the idea. Come in. Happy birthday, Sheila. Same from me. Thanks, John. William. My, my. It looks like a great day for the florist. Yes. Everyone sent flowers. Everyone except Barney. Have you seen him, John? - No. Thanks for your roses. You remembered I liked them. Yes. Well, we're all set for a long run, Sheila. Tickets selling into next spring. I'll see you after the matinee. - Alright. William, how nice. But these orchids are from you and Eloise. No, no. They're from Eloise. I loathe orchids. They have no scent, you know. I bought these violets .. With a quarter I found in the lining of an old, tweed jacket. My very own quarter, it was. Thank you, William. I love them. Hey, you did alright. Uhuh. No white roses. - Huh? Barney always used to send white roses. Why do you hang on to that fellow, Sheila? Why don't you forget him? Well. First, because I remember. I remember not so long ago when I was alone in New York. No work, no friends. At least, nobody who cared very much. And then I met Barney. He'd just sold a play. He liked me. He believed in me. He made me feel wonderful. Alive. And wanted. He got me the lead in his play. Against everyone else's objections, he got it for me. It was a good play. A great play. It made a star of me. I remember that. And I remember the roses he sent me every week the play ran. White roses. And I suppose white roses are out of season, now? Sheila, you can't go on just being grateful to Barney. That wears pretty thin. It is a little more than that, William. You see, I remember when Barney started drinking. When he couldn't write another play for me. I remember the first time he was called Sheila Page's husband. The white roses I got the next day had a card that read: 'From Mr Sheila Page'. I remember all those things. But most of all I remember I loved him. And I love him now. Take these directly to Sheila Page's dressing-room, will you. It's the first one over there. - Yes, sir. Thank you. You may be right, William. Maybe he isn't worth saving. But I've been given a year to try. A year to live over and right all those wrongs. And I'm going to do it. I must do it. Mrs Sheila Page? - Uhuh. Thank you. White roses. 'Love, Barney'. See, William? He remembered. You were wrong. I hope so, Sheila. How nice. I always say Thanksgiving wouldn't be Thanksgiving without turkey. Is that so? What would it be? Where is the bar? - Oh, Miss Michaels. Would you like some turkey? Good heavens, no. I never eat on an empty stomach. Hi Sheila, hi John. - Hello, Bess. I always say it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without sparkling burgundy. Oh, I've thought of you, Bess. That way. - Thanks, pal. At least Bess will have a good time at your party, John. I'm sorry, Sheila. Barney is looking around for Paula. He doesn't know yet you haven't invited her. The trick is to fill the hollow stem with Cognac. It gives the champagne quite a bounce. I've tried that. Except I didn't bounce. I just rose to the ceiling and stayed there. To the ceiling? To the moon! You can go places on this stuff. Ah, Mrs Page. Would you care to join us? We're going to the moon. If you want to get away from it all, why not the moon? It's not so crowded as California. Take it easy, darling. Have a good time, but take it easy, huh? Make up your mind. I can't do both. Ah, 1941. Was that a good year for champagne? It was a far better year for champagne than it was for me. I had a hit play that year starring my wife. Never marry an actress, Bob. They're not real people. May I have the wine, please? Barney, I have a headache. It's been an awfully trying day. Do you think we could go home now? I didn't want to come to this party in this first place. But now that I'm here I'm trying to make the best of it. You're right about the champagne. It wasn't a good year. I'll stick to straight Cognac. Happy Thanksgiving everybody. Everybody seems to be here but Paula Costello. It seems odd to see Mr Page without her. Eloise. Oh, come now. It can't be any secret that they are seen everywhere together. Not that I approve. But I am getting used to show-people. Paula is helping Barney with his new play. The Guild wanted some changes. The Guild isn't doing Barney's play. It's doing Hillgardner's operetta. I ought to know. I'm backing it. You had to open your big mouth. William. Bess, where did Barney go? - I don't know. Just look for a bottle of Cognac. He'll be with it. Now I know where I met you. At the Page's New Year's party. You played the piano divinely. Have you ever thought of a concert tour? Privately financed? Wouldn't that be rather expensive? Expense is no item. If I can inspire a young talent. All I ask is a bit of gratitude. Some of my prot?g?s have been most ungrateful. William. Will you find Barney for me? I think he went home. - Oh, William. You know better than that. What do you mean? Where is Barney? - Do you really want to know? Eloise. Look! But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the East. And Juliet is the sun. Do you think they'll let me take him home today? If they are sure there is nothing more they can do. You would think after three weeks .. - It's a miracle he's alive, Sheila. I know. Does it take something like this to make things right? Why should that be? I hope it will make things right. Barney needs me now, John. That's a start towards things being right. He needs me. Well, Doctor? Would you like to sit down, Mrs Page? Doctor Ross has confirmed my findings. The concussion and haemorrhage have caused paralysis of the lower extremity. And it is permanent? - That's hard to say at this time. Cases vary. People in your husband's condition have been known to walk again in a week. In a year .. Sometimes never. It all depends. Your husband must have quiet. Rest. No excitement. No emotional disturbances. And of course, no liquor. I am sure with your care and understanding .. We can look to at least a partial recovery. You'll have to be very patient. May I see him now? I hope he'll talk to you. Barney. I've come to take you home, Barney. The doctors have assured me that in time with proper care you'll be well again. Just a temporary paralysis. It will be nice to have you home again, Barney. Is he ready to go, nurse? - Yes, he is. Be careful, John. - I'll be careful. Here we go, Barney. There. That wasn't too bad, was it? Here, Mattie. Isn't it wonderful to have him home again. Oh yes, Mrs Page. Barney. Would you like to sit by the fire? Are you comfortable, dear? Can I get you something? Anything? Would you rather lie down? I'm sorry, John. - Oh, that's alright. The understudy can carry on for a while. However, I would like you back for Christmas week if you can manage it. I think I can. I hope so. Hello. Hello, Bess. That's right. By the Police. It was all Mrs Shaw's fault. It happened in that toy shop on Fifth Avenue. What is it? It's William. He's been committed to an insane asylum. - An insane asylum? Stay with Barney, will you John? Of course. We're not allowed to shake hands. Sit down, won't you. Well, you predicted this, remember? What about Barney? What happens to him now? He's home, William. There's a chance he may never walk again. Poor Sheila. What are you going to do? I don't know. I'm all confused. You see, it didn't happen this way the first time. I mean .. - I know. You tried to tell me once, that now was a year ago. And that you had been through it all before. And you didn't understand, naturally. Maybe I did. I think I do now. At least, the idea appeals to me. I wish I could live this year over again. But you are. You're living it over, with me. Everyone is. Only nobody knows. Except you and me and I found it out too late. But Barney is paralysed and that didn't happen the first time. No. - Sheila. That means that destiny has slipped a little. Maybe we can escape from her while she's picking herself up. What is it we're escaping from, Sheila? I killed Barney, William. I shot him. It was New Year's eve. That mustn't happen again. We haven't much time, have we. But don't give up. We'll think of something. Dear William. I'm supposed to be here cheering you up. Maybe we're on the wrong sides of this table. That might be true. That might be true. Tell me. Before. Did I escape from this place? Yes .. on New Year's eve. You just walked out and got on a bus. I was thinking of doing that. It works? It works. As easy as that. William .. is it terrible? Terrible? Oh no, no. I sort-of like it. It is .. It's kind of home-like. Home-like? This? You didn't know my home. Oh, they can't keep you in here, can they, William? Isn't there something I can do? Not until they find out what's wrong with me. One doctor thinks I'm 'schizophrenic'. Another says 'paranoid'. I try to keep them all happy. Uhoh. Time is up. Do you need anything? Can I send in something? Yeah. Send me some hair and some virgin wool and some common pins. I want to make a voodoo doll in the image of laughing-boy here. And stick pins in it with a curse. Time is up. That always drives them frantic. Goodbye, William. Merry Christmas, Sheila. How does that look, Mattie? - It looks beautiful. You can see the tree now. I thought we'd have an old-fashioned tree with old-fashioned trimmings. It seems that Christmas-tree decorations get gaudier by the year. They have plastic candles this season. All colors. That bubble like little fountains. The trees look like jukeboxes. There. Isn't it beautiful? Giuseppe's little girl from the market strung popcorn and cranberries for me. That's the way I remember my first tree at my grandmother's. Oh, it's a greeting-card Christmas in New York. I wish I could write 'Merry Christmas' across Washington Square. And send it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it like this. The tree is from Pocono Hills where we spent our honeymoon. Remember, darling? I waited for you to see me put up the star. Well, I've got to get down to the theatre. Friday said when my name was announced again the ticket brokers had a big rush. Mattie will bring your dinner in, in a few minutes. Wish me luck, darling. Mr Page, would you like tea or coffee? I thought they were taboo on my diet. The doctor said just this once because it is Christmas Eve. Bring me the telephone, Mattie. As long as the doctor is playing Santa Claus. I think I'll have a little brandy on the doctor. Well, I don't know about the brandy. There's a bottle on the top shelf in the broom closet. Bring it to me. Please, Mr Page. Mattie. It's Christmas Eve. Oh, and Mattie. Two glasses. Hello, Paula? This is Barney. Here she is. I was supposed to make a 'Welcome back' speech, Sheila, but .. Well, all I can think of to say is .. Welcome back. Mr Page asked me to call, Mattie. I couldn't get over right away. Is he still up? Just a moment please. Mr Page, you have a visitor. Show her in, Mattie. Please. Paula. Hello, Barney. - Paula. You did come. Sit down, huh? - Oh, thank you. I am .. I'm sailing for London on New Year's eve. I've been rather busy, but I did mean to come and see you before I left. You are sailing on New Year's eve? Hmm. Midnight. I thought the boat would be better than flying. It will give me time to do some work on my new play. They've offered me a London production. Don't go, Paula. I'll be up and around after New Year's. We could take up where we left off. I feel wonderful except for my legs. That will only be a matter of a week or so. You mean, you'll be able to walk again so soon? Of course. What did you think? - Well, I heard .. Well, I understood .. What? What did you hear? I understood it might be permanent. That is ridiculous. Look. Oh, Barney. I still feel a little weak. I have to learn to walk all over again. You didn't really believe it was permanent, did you? What does it matter what I believe? The main thing is for you to get well. That will be soon, Paula. I could join you in London. Perhaps they'd go for my new play over there. They might. Who told you I'd never walk again? Sheila? No. Of course not. - You didn't just make it up? Why Barney, what a question. Suppose I never walked again? Would that change things? What things, Barney? I might echo .. What a question. You spoke about taking up where we left off. Don't you think we'd better leave things there for a while? After all, this is hardly the time. Sit down, Paula. Have a drink. - No. No thank you. Really, I must go. You'll say goodbye to Sheila for me? You can say goodbye to Sheila in person, Paula. Goodbye, Barney. I sail for London on New Year's eve. I came up to say goodbye. I came home without changing. If I had known Barney wasn't alone I could have taken another curtain call. You were leaving, Paula? - Yes, I was. So, you're running away. Had you thought about taking Barney with you? To London? - Barney likes London. And he needs the care of someone who loves him. Whom he loves. You do love him don't you, Paula? Barney sent for me tonight. That's the only reason I'm here if you must know. I thought perhaps your conscience had brought you. Well, now that we're alone. Aren't you going to ask me to give up Barney so that you can be married? Sheila, you're not serious. But isn't that the logical thing to expect? When two people fall in love? I know this has been a terrible thing for you as well as for Barney. The past few weeks must have been expensive. With hospital bills, nurses and specialists. Barney gave me this clip for my birthday. It was frightfully expensive. Will you take it? It might help. And I have no use for it now. Is this all Barney meant to you? I wonder if you know how much he meant to me. I wonder if you know how much I meant to him before he met you. Oh Sheila, you're breaking my heart. Shall we have a good cry? Come here. Sit down. You hit her hard. Paula was too much of a lady to slap you back. But I'm no gentleman. Another curtain, Mrs Page? Not tonight. Please, Mike. It's only a quarter to eleven. You're off too early. Sorry to race through it. I just didn't feel like playing it tonight. Oh, that's alright. That New Year's eve crowd wouldn't know the difference. John .. will you do me a favor? Certainly. Take me home. I want someone with me until after midnight. Of course. It's very important. I hate to take you away from your party. - Oh, they'll never miss me. I'm just the host. Remember, John. Don't leave me alone with Barney for a moment. No matter what happens. What are you afraid of? What could possibly happen? Nothing. As long as you're with me. Come with me now. Let's see how Barney is. Right. John, turn on the lights. Barney! Mattie. Where is Barney? He left you this note. I tried to stop him, Mrs Page. But how could he leave? He can't walk. He can walk. That will be all. Thank you, steward. Thank you, Miss. Barney. How nice of you to come down to the boat. I'm not having a 'Bon-Voyage' party. I hate those things. I am glad you came. It was sweet of you. I'll order some champagne, shall I? I didn't come to see you off, Paula. I'm sailing with you. Barney, you don't mean that? Why not? You're not well. - Not well? I'm here. No-one carried me. In another week, I can throw this away. In London. We decided to wait. Remember? Paula, Sheila lied to you. There's nothing seriously wrong with me. I'm not an invalid. Barney, it was all a mistake. - A mistake? Yes, a series of mistakes. Let's not make any more. Is that all it adds up to? A mistake? Oh, Barney, don't be a fool. You can't go with me to London and that's that. Can you look at me and say that? I .. I made a deal with Sheila. - You did what? I made a deal to give you up. I'm sticking to my bargain. Sheila loves you. She loves you much more than I ever could. But I don't love Sheila. She interferes with everything I wanted to do. And now she interferes with us. I won't have it! - Please, Barney. You're shouting. You call me a fool, Paula. But you're the fool. Throwing away everything because of a stupid, snivelling girl. I won't let her interfere with our lives. I'll kill her first! Barney, for heaven's sake. Come in. All visitors ashore, Miss. Thank you, steward. My guest was just leaving. Goodbye, Barney. - I won't go. Oh, yes you will. I don't want to have you thrown off. Please, Barney. Goodbye. May I help you, sir? - Take your hands off of me. Thanks John, for everything. I don't like to leave you alone. I'll be alright. You go on to your party. I've kept you away too long. Well, it doesn't matter. You've been very patient with me. There may have been many times this year when you felt I was behaving strangely. Well .. Someday, I'll explain it all to you. Tonight was New Year's eve again. And I was frightened. But I'm safe now, John. You needn't be worried about me. I'm safe. Nothing can happen now. Well, happy New Year, Sheila. It .. could be, you know. I know, John. Thanks. Goodnight. Goodnight. That's right, Sheila. People shouldn't be in bed on New Year's eve. Or in wheelchairs. They should be out dancing. Or sailing at midnight. I've come back, Sheila. I can walk. I can walk as well as any man. You thought I'd stopped walking forever, didn't you? You tried to stop me from so many things. Stop me from drinking. Stop me from loving and being loved. Maybe, you hoped one day you'd stop me from living. You told Paula I'd need constant care for ever. That I was as helpless as a child. You shouldn't have said that, Sheila. I'm not helpless. I'm not a child. And you are so young. So young. Too young to die. Is that what you are thinking? No. You can't escape, Sheila. I've got to kill you. If I don't, you'll try to live my life for me again. You'll try to stop me from living the way I want to live. No, Barney. No! Please. You're frightened, aren't you. That's because you're guilty. You tried to destroy me. You almost succeeded. 'Almost' I say. Now it's my turn. I'm alive, I can walk, and I hate you. I think I've always hated you. I must destroy that hate before I can ever love anything again. Where's the gun? I had a gun before. William. Open up in there! I'll be taking that gun, lad. Of course, Officer. I won't be needing it anymore. He's dead. Oh, William. Why? It's alright, Sheila. They can't do anything to me. You can't do anything to me. I'm mad, you know. We picked up that nut. He just killed a man. Okay, Captain. Alright, lad. Sheila. They came to my apartment looking for him. I was afraid he'd come here. Destiny is a stubborn old girl, Sheila. She doesn't like people interfering with her plans. But we tricked her, didn't we? Anyway. l doubt she cares about the pattern as long as the result is the same. Happy New Year, Sheila.
