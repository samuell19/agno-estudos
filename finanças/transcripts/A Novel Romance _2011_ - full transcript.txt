(Rock music plays) ( man on speaker ) Okay, guys, so it sounds good so far for printing out of home. ( man on speaker ) Yeah, those three billboards sound very cool. So moving down the list, we want to talk about digital. Well, I have got my man Nate Shepherd here, and he would be happy to walk you through what we have planned there. Yeah, great. Hi, fellas, this is Nate Shepherd here, and first of all, I wanna tell you guys we are so thrilled to be working with Megaway Games. Oh, wait, Nate Shepherd ? The &quot;Oopsy-daisy, look what I did&quot; guy ? Yeah, that's me, I'm the Oopsy-daisy guy. Yeah, I was there from 1982 to 1987, and I won a Clio for them. ♪ All the world a mystery ♪ Remember when we used to know it all... So what do you say, Oopsy Daisy ? You wanna go ahead and fill these guys in on what we've got planned for digital ? Well, the first thing we were thinking about is we were gonna do some banner ads. Banner ads ? Then we do a &quot;tweeter&quot; page, which is-- Twitter ? I know that this is a lot to absorb, so what you should do is just drink it in, and I can guarantee you that you-- Guys, why don't we draw up some spec-page designs on our end on all the different social-network sites and I'll hit your inbox up with those, probably like Tuesday at the latest, how's that sound ? Yeah, all right, that's no problem. ♪ All the past a mystery ♪ Remember when remember how Yeah, you wanna turn that off, please ? Yeah, sure. ( man ) That was sad. Why can't anyone just go out gracefully anymore ? The button says &quot;off&quot; on it. We just don't see this working out anymore. The good news is now you got a lot of time to work on that novel you're always talking about. Good luck. I quit. Excuse me, hold on. Excuse me. So, what do we do now ? You tell me your day, I'll tell you my day, and whoever had the shittier day gets the honor of smoking the cigarette. All right, then who's gonna moderate ? I'll do it. All right, all right. Ladies first. Well, my dog died. What's your dog's name ? Scruffy. Oh, Scruffy. And how did he die ? He was hit by a car. And where did this happen ? In the street. Where in the street ? Was it uptown, downtown ? East Side, West Side, the Village ? Okay look, look, my dog didn't die. Really ? Yeah, I-- I'm waiting for my boyfriend. We had a fight this morning, we haven't seen or spoken to each other all day, and like I said, I'm a little tense. So can I have it ? You don't even want to hear about mine, do you ? Not if I don't have to. Oh, I'm not in the mood either, but thanks. You really had a fight with your boyfriend ? You sure ? Of course. Thanks, man. Jeez. Tell me your day. Oh, hi. God already smited the cigarette, it's menthol. So lay it on me, big guy. Oh, I woke up at noon, I had a cup of coffee left over from yesterday, sat at the computer for three hours. I took a nap... and I called my mother. Wow. That's a shitty day. Yeah. Screenplays ? Hmm ? Pardon ? You write screenplays ? No, no... screenplays-- Screenplays are for wimps-- I write novels. I'm a novelist. Well, I'm working on my first novel and I'm gonna finish it, soon. Oh. Who are you waiting for ? My girlfriend. And her friend. And her friend's boyfriend, and we're all having dinner together. Nice people ? I don't know, I haven't met them yet, but-- That's funny. My boyfriend and I are waiting for this girl I used to work with and her boyfriend who I've never met. Jenny ? Nate ? Yes-- oh... I don't believe it. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Wow. I should have known. Why is that ? Because of your utter ruthlessness in getting the cigarette. Excuse me ? No, no, no, don't worry, it's a compliment. Utter ruthlessness is one of Adi's most beautiful qualities, I love it. It is ? And your ability to stealth- like sneak up on people. Hi, baby. Hi, how are you ? Hey, so I see you guys found each other. Yeah, we fought over a cigarette. What ? I'll tell you later, it's a long story. Hey, you look so skinny. Oh, stop it. You look skinny, look at you. We're both skinny, we're all skinny. Where's Buddy ? Right here. Hey. How you doing ? Hey, hi. Hey. Hey, how are you ? Good. So where's the man ? Um, he's-- He's kind of behind you. Oh shit, sorry, man, how you doing ? Hey, hi. Hi, I'm Buddy, nice to meet you. Hey, hi, good. Come on, what's going on with the table, I'm starved. Oh no, I spoke to them, it's a few minutes' wait-- You know what, do me a favor. Just check that for me, I'm gonna go take care of-- Yeah, 'cause I wanna-- I-- Great. Yeah, I'll-- Yeah... right. Yeah, you wanna wait with me ? You wanna... ? Oh, my God, we have to do this again soon. How about over the weekend ? Oh, I can't. I'm going up to my cousin's wedding in Boston. It was so good to see you. ( Nate ) Taxi ! You too. Yo, yo ! This was really fun. If you guys want a taxi-- Oh. I got a taxi if you want a taxi. Are you sure ? Sure, sure, go ahead, yeah. Great. Pleasure. It was nice meeting you. Good luck with the whole writing thing, man. Oh, thank you, thank you. It was great meeting you. Wow, thank you. And good luck with the whole taking-over-the-world thing. This guy, right ? It was really good to meet you, and it's about time. I'll see you. Bye. Get home safe. Bye. Bye. ( Buddy ) Jenny, let's roll ! I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh, boy. Great, Nate. I don't see another taxi in sight. Now what are we gonna do ? Why she's with a guy like Buddy, I have no idea. The man's a moron, he's a dick ! Yeah ? Well, that moron-dick got a million-dollar Christmas bonus last year ! Really ? Really. Wow, a million dollars. Good for him, all right ? The question is, are they happy ? ( moaning ) Oh ! Oh ! Oh, my God, I came so hard. Where's this coming from ? I've kind of been thinking about it for awhile. I misled you. How'd I mislead you ? Well, when we met, you had your job at Metro. I mean, you had direction, you had... Money. You said it, not me. That's all right, you've said enough. Adi, I'm just trying to live out my dreams. Live out your dreams ? You wrote the first 200 pages of that book seven months ago. How many have you written since then ? Ten ? 15 ? What are you saying ? You're scared. This is bullshit. Wait, wait, wait, you don't have to leave tonight. Call me crazy, but when someone dumps me, I like to get as far away from that person who's dumping me so I can start with the beginning-to-hate-her part. Look, you're going for it and that's great, but I need stability. I mean, you can understand that, right ? I mean, it's not you. Please stay. Let me get this straight. You're breaking up with me because you don't believe in me. Not so much. Or my dreams. No. But you want me to stay the night ? Yeah. Please ? For a little while ? Until I fall asleep. You know I get scared. I don't know, &quot;Adeez.&quot; Boobies, hee-hee. I don't understand why you can't come with me and tell Slick to come another weekend. We settled this, Jenny. I told you, he's got to be here for work on Monday. Well, I don't like what we settled. Well, settled is settled. The subject is no longer up for debate. And his name isn't Slick-- it's Steele, Sam Steele. Whatever. Slick ? You're the slick one, slicky. Slicky McSlick. We've been dating a year and a half, I've never even heard of this guy. Well, now you're gonna meet him, so what do you want from me ? Nate ? Nate ? You can go now, I'm sleepy enough. Thanks. I knew it. I knew it ! ( Jenny ) Where the hell is this guy ? His plane got in 45 minutes ago. It takes time to get into the city. Well, unlike you, Buddy, I didn't take the day off to hang with a pal. I've got to get to work. So leave and we'll catch you later. When are you gonna catch me later if I'm going straight to the shuttle from the office ? Right, I forgot. You know what-- Let's get real for a second. Hey, look, I know we've only been living together for a couple of months, but something has changed between us. I'm not happy-- ( Sam ) Dude ! It's the man of Steele, baby ! My brother, the Big Apple baby. How you doing, bro ? I'm rockin', baby, rockin'. How was the flight ? The stewardesses were smokin', they were so hot. I hear you're doing great, man. You know how we do out in Cali. So, this is my girl, Jenny Sparks, Sammy Steele. Hi, nice to meet you, Sammy. I've heard so much about you. Likewise. Oh, come on, you guys gotta do better than that. I want some hugs. Buddy... I'm in if you are. Go hug. Bring it, bring it. There you go. Oh, yeah, yeah. I felt something. I gotta go. Oh, really ? Yeah, I'm late for work already. Yeah, then she's headed right up to Boston for a wedding, it sucks. Oh no, I thought we were gonna get to spend some QT together. Let me tell you, this guy's got a ton of broads back in Cali waiting for the full 4-1-1 about you. Oh, that's sweet. I'm sorry you had this business trip while I was away. Come on, what business trip ? That's great, Buddy. Jenny-- Dude, did I totally just fuck up or what ? No, no. You gonna go after her ? Nah, she needs to cool off. A weekend apart's the best thing for us, trust me. ( man ) You're the reason why I don't write. Nate, this is really good-- it's really, really good. No, really ? Barry, you think so ? Man, you need to learn how to take a compliment. I just didn't know if it was ready to be read by somebody. I mean, especially yourself, you're a professional editor. First of all, I'm not an editor, all right ? I'm an associate editor-- big difference. And secondly, I'm not just someone, I'm your acquaintance, and that goes a long way around here-- oh, yes. You think I would read some unrepped author's book if I didn't know him ? Wait a minute, are you-- Are you trying to say that I need representation ? You know, at first I thought, you know, I'd just take it home and I'd read it, and if the first chapter didn't grab me, I'd just say it wasn't for me, but fuck me Kentucky, you had me from sentence number one. Come on ! You know, that part at the end... Yeah-- It seemed very John Irving. Oh, sure, sure. I was thinking that when I was-- I mean, you could be like the next John Irving. Come on ! 'Cause you know, he's dead, so he doesn't give a fuck, right ? No, he's alive. Really ? Yeah, John Irving's alive, of course. That sucks. Fuck it, we'll come up with something else. Wait, let's just get back to this. Do you have somebody in mind to be an agent or a manager ? I was just thinking maybe I could just give you some notes first. Notes ? Oh, that's nice. Nothing's gonna hurt, man. Come on, come on ! Ow... what ?! We better slow down, man, my heart is just racing. Let's go ! ( dance music playing ) Hello, ladies. Hi ! Hi ! Nate ? Oh, Adi, hey. What are you doing here ? Oh, I was just walking by, had a meeting. A meeting ? Yeah. It's like 10:00 at night. Well, the people over at Street Light, they burn the candle at both ends. They read my novel, they liked it, and they called me in for a meeting. Wow, that's amazing news. Well, I'm pretty happy about it, it just-- Stupid cab driver wouldn't break a 50. Um, Nate, this is Douglas, Douglas, this is Nate. How are you ? The-- My... ex-writer. Well, actually, we used to date. We used to go out. Nate just got some amazing news about that little book I was telling you he was writing. Oh, yeah. You finally finished it ? Well, yes. Actually, it's not a little book, it's a novel. He says that Street Light Press wants to publish it. Oh, well, no, correction. They don't want to publish it yet, but we've had a meeting, very, very positive. Who's your person over at Street Light ? Barry Jones. No-- Walter is a good buddy of mine. Walter ? Walter Evans, senior editor. Oh ! Sure, sure. And so you must be a writer. I'm a trader. Trader ? Money. Money ! You're a Wall Street trader, of course-- Oh, my goodness, sure. Well, great to meet you. How do you know Walter Evans ? I play in a sloshball league. What's that ? It's like... It's like flag football with beer. Oh. A big charity thing, all the heavy-hitters get together, it's a lot of fun, a lot of fun. All right, great-- Great bumping into you, Nate. That sounds like-- Doug. --las, Douglas. Douglas, nice to meet you. All right, man. Bye, Nate. Okay, I'll... I'm seeing somebody. So ? Then they're hooking up in the bathroom and all of a sudden, she thinks they're, like, moving in together. So I said to her, one blowjob a boyfriend does not make. Articulate. I did go to Vassar, you know. What's your friend Raines like ? She's a freak. Why ? You like her or something ? That was fun. Thank you for dinner. That was good. I love watching you eat. Thanks. Wanna go upstairs ? Um, not yet. It's okay. I'll see you. Thanks again, I had fun. Bye. Bye. I shouldn't-- I shouldn't be doing this. Silly boy. Really-- really shouldn't-- Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh. Oh. ( cell phone vibrating ) Hold on a sec-- hold on, my phone. Oh, fuck... I gotta go. No, no, no, I gotta-- I really gotta-- I gotta go. Stay. And I'll make it worth your while. I promise. ( cell phone ringing ) Hello ? Hey. Hey. Thanks for meeting me. Sure. So the body was flown back to Los Angeles for a funeral on Thursday, and then there'll be a memorial service here in New York. I can't believe that guy's dead. I know, Buddy's dead. His heart couldn't take it. It's just a classic drug overdose. Oh, and... Well... What ? Apparently, there was another girl or something. I guess she was the one who called 9-1-1. Who was she ? No one knows. She was gone by the time the paramedics got there. Oh, Jesus. Poor Jenny. She's been really incredible about this whole thing. Nate, there's-- there's something I want to ask you, and you can say no if you want to and I won't be mad. You want me to go to the funeral with you ? I don't think so. I feel very badly for Jenny, and I will go to the memorial service with you if it's in town, but Adi, I'm not your boyfriend anymore. You're right. You're not. You win again. Nate. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. It's just-- I got you these and I just-- Thank you. I apologize, I'm just not-- It's okay. I like the white lights the best. How about you ? I like yellow. Oh. It reminds me of spring-- Easter-y. Right. Buddy liked it when it was blue. It's funny, the real-estate broker could only show us apartments at night. We were cool with that, 'cause we both worked, so I hustled the two blocks over here, I took the elevator up, walked in, and the place was completely empty. And then the broker said Buddy was up on the roof, so I went up there and sure enough, there he was, standing all by himself staring at the Empire State Building. He turned to me and he said, &quot;I took it.&quot; It was the first place we were looking at. I hadn't even had a chance to look around. I didn't know whether to be pissed or what. Then I saw the view from up there. I saw the view and I knew he'd found our home. I don't think she's cried yet. Yeah, she was like that when our grandfather died. She's-- she's trying to be strong. Yeah, but for who ? Why do you think Buddy liked blue lights the best ? I don't remember. So I read your rewrite. Finally. I didn't think you were gonna bring it up. I thought you were gonna bring it up first. Thanks for putting me through the agony. What'd you think ? I think we need to go shopping for an agent. You're kidding ! No. You liked it ? I mean, I liked it before, but now I love it. Oh, Barry ! Hey, look, I don't know how to say this to you, you know, you're a big shot and all, but could I have an advance ? Jenny, we need you in here ! Where'd she go ? She was doing his closet. ( Adi ) Jenny ? God. You okay ? You-- You all right, sweetie ? I can't stay here. That's all right, you're gonna stay with me for a few nights. No, I mean ever. I can't stay here ever again. Don't say that, it's only been a few weeks. Things will start to look different. Oh, yeah ? How's that ? I'm like suddenly gonna wake up one morning and not smell Buddy's scent everywhere or picture him fucking that girl here ? All right, stop it, Jenny, come on. She's just trying to help. Well, she can't help, no one can. Don't you guys get it ? God, I know things could have been better with us, but when he was alive, at least we had a chance. You'll get through this. We're here for you. Why are you crying now ? I'm not, I'm not. It's just-- This whole thing is just so sad. I'm-- I'm sorry, you guys. I'm fine, I really am. I'm-- I'm fine. I'll figure it out. Wait a second, I've got it ! ( woman ) Got what ? You could live with Nate. With Nate ? Yeah, he's being evicted, you guys can split the rent. His place is huge. He doesn't have anything, anyway. Wait, Nate's being evicted ? And this way, you can keep your place and give you some more time to decide if you want to sell it. I don't know. What's stopping you ? Are you sure you would be okay with that ? Totally. I mean, honestly, it wouldn't be weird for you ? It was my idea. Now, are you guys really finished or just sleeping- together-sometimes finished ? We are really finished. You're sure ? I'm sure. It's an option. ( doorbell ringing ) ( Nate ) Coming. Hi. Hi. Don't worry about this, it's completely safe. Okay. You get the hang of it. I oil it all the time, just-- Right. Wow, this is big. Yeah, 3,000 square feet. It used to be a warehouse for the lamp store on the ground floor, and the old lady who owns it, she gives me all these goofy lamps that go out of style. Oh, like that one ? No, that one I bought. Did you find the place okay ? Oh, yeah. It's just a couple stops from where we-- Where I live. I know. Hey, how about some coffee ? I just made a pot. And I could get some orange juice-- Oh, that-- That's okay. You know, Nate, I don't think this is gonna work out. Why ? You just got here. And I could really use the money. It's just-- It's-- I don't know what. Confusing, weird, rushed ? Exactly. I feel the same way. You do? Of course. Would you like to sit down ? Just for a second ? Sure, yeah. Thank you. When Adi first told me this idea, I thought she was totally nuts. First of all, it's a completely selfless gesture with no ulterior motive, and that doesn't sound like Adi. Right. And second of all, I've never lived with a woman. Well, you know, I thought it was totally nuts, too, but for different reasons. What were they ? Truthfully ? Oh, no, no, it's really not that bad. Look, I really do need to get out of my place, I am completely losing it there. But I didn't want you to get the wrong idea. I-- I just mean that, you know, we had a pretty unusual start. It's not so out of left field for me to think that, is it ? I guess not. Look, um... You'd have to know, this would just be a temporary situation, just two friends helping each other out in a time of need. I'll do you one better. Two people helping each other out. Two people. Who would hardly even see each other. They come and go as they please. One works full time. The other one writes in his room. They'd be practically-- Strangers. Strangers. Okay. Okay ? Okay. Deal ? Deal. You need any help ? Nope, I am almost finished. Can I talk to you for a minute ? Sure. I know you might think this is silly, but I put together some guidelines for us to follow as roommates. Guidelines ? Rules, if you will. Rules ? Commandments, really. Commandments ? How many of these commandments are there ? Ten. I have ten of them. I don't know why I bothered asking. Wanna hear 'em ? Why not ? Okay. Commandment number one. &quot;Thou shall not leave tampon wrappers &quot;or other womanly things visible in my garbage for thy roommate to bear witness to.&quot; Okay, got it. But, wait, are you gonna say &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thy&quot; through this whole list ? Yeah, I thought you might think it was cute. Oh, okay... I don't. &quot;Number two, thou shall put away all dishes after use.&quot; Of course. &quot;Number three, thou shall not allow any pets &quot;or furry mammals into thy loft, for thy roommate is horribly allergic.&quot; Not a problem. &quot;Number four, thou shall not rent any chick flicks while Giants or Knicks games are on.&quot; Wait, what constitutes a chick flick ? Chick flick, that would be anything with a Jane in it, Jane Austen or Jane Campion or Jane anything. &quot;Number five, thou shall not make too much noise &quot;whilst eating. &quot;Number six, thou shall leave the loft while thy roommate is here with a date.&quot; Oh, that goes for you, too. Okay. &quot;Number seven, thou shall not play radio or television too loudly whilst thy roommate is writing.&quot; Fine. Okay. &quot;Number eight, thou shall pay bills in a timely fashion.&quot; Isn't that why I'm here ? True. &quot;And number nine, thou shall not tell others thy roommate's business, especially Adi.&quot; Oh, absolutely. Deal. So what's number ten ? We already covered that. What is it ? Thou shall not covet thy roommate. Don't flatter yourself. I'm not too bad, right ? Anal, but not too bad. Yes, I'm usually correct. Barry, I'm so sorry I'm late, I went to the wrong place, I apologize. No, no, you're in the right place, here's the right lady. Alexandra Dumar, meet Nate Shepherd. It's a pleasure. Oh, pleasure's all mine. Barry has said such amazing things about you. I think you're an extremely talented writer. And I think you have extremely good taste. Hey, what are you doing ? It's me. Well, that sounds like fun. Bellini. Excuse me ? Oh, Bellini, Bellini. No, no, no, never on the first date. Let's get this straight, right out of the box, okay, Nate ? Yeah. This is all about business. Okay. I want to represent you. This is not a date. I don't want to fuck you. Oh, no-- No, I didn't think so. Although I am getting a lot of that lately. What ? Who else have you been talking to ? What the fuck is going on, Barry ? You told me I had an exclusive on this guy. This is news to me, I mean, you've been talking to somebody else ? No, no, no, no, I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm just-- I'm making a bad joke. I made a terrible joke and I'm nervous. You're a big agent and an important lady and-- In fact, I would love a Bellini. Good. I'd love two Bellinis. I'll drink as many Bellinis as you can order, I'll drink. I'm-- I'm thirsty ! Hey, girls. Hi. How you doing ? Good. You look great. Thank you. Come on, what the-- What the hell, come on ! No, son of a-- are you serious ? I mean, give me a break, four hot girls and you guys ? Yeah, I could do with some good old-fashioned flirting. ( woman ) There we are. Oh, not bad, not bad. The way I see it is that Barry here should slip the manuscript to Walter. Walter Evans ? Uh-huh. And, Barry, you can say it's a hot property that you got first dibs on because of our relationship. And we shouldn't tell Walter that Barry and I know each other ? Never, 'cause then it's Barry doing a favor for an old friend. No, no, no, this way, it's all on the up-and-up. She's right. You are like a fishing lure in that dress. What did you say your name was again ? Jenny ! Jenny ! And this means that you'll be my agent. I will be your agent. And can I tell people ? You may tell whoever you'd like. So what now ? Do I go to your office to sign contracts ? Yeah, we'll get there, Nate. The first thing is, you should go through the book one last time, looking for any typos, seeing if there's any last-minute jokes you may want to add. But it's not a comedy. I know. Are you having fun ? Very, very good time. Um-- Um, no-- I'm-- What are you doing ? Jenny ! Where's my new roommate ? Jenny ! I got great news. Jenny ? Are you okay ? Fucking perfect ! Jenny, it's me. I just want to go home. ( doorbell ringing ) ( Jenny ) Fucking elevator. All right. I can't get it open. All right. Are you drunk ? Maybe. Is that a problem ? This go against one of your commandments or something ? No. ( vomiting ) But that does. It's our first night together, huh ? Okay. I'm never gonna drink-- ( vomiting ) Hello ? Anybody in there ? Want coffee ? Oh, my gosh, thank you. Sure-- be careful, it's hot. All right. How do you feel ? Um, not so good. Aw, poor thing. Well, if it's any consolation, I'll tell you right now, you're not a sloppy drunk. You're very kind. Not to be insensitive, but did you ever find out anything more about that girl Buddy was with ? That's a pretty big question there, stranger. Yeah, I know, but... Well, um... I don't know. I would just want to know if anything happened between them. I mean, I'd wanna know for sure, just-- You know, just for closure, but it's none of my business. You're right, it's none of your business. But if you're so concerned, I'll tell you what I know. I spoke to Buddy's friend, Sam, and the last he saw, Buddy and this girl named Raines walked off together. That's all he knows. Don't you wanna know more? Like what? Like if they fucked? No. No, Nate, I don't want to know any of that shit. God, I'm sorry I don't share your writer's curiosity, but you know, this is something more than just a weird thing that happened to me. God. I just want to be left alone to mourn my dead boyfriend, okay? Ugh. Jeez. ♪ I think about the world I lived in when I was a tyke ♪ And I think about the world I live in when I leave this life ♪ My memories are better than reality is today ♪ I separate them all ♪ From feelings when I feel this way... What's going on ? A peace offering ? Okay. And a thank-you for taking care of me last night. I-- I am so embarrassed... and you were there for me when you didn't have to be, and I really, really appreciate that. Oh. Oh, you're cute. Oh. But just one thing. No more questions about Buddy, okay? It's my one and only commandment. Of course. Swear on it. Swear on it. No more questions about Buddy. Thank you. Now when am I gonna read this novel of yours? You really want to? Yeah, lay it on me. You are so nice. Yeah. Over here, yeah? Jenny? Jenny ! What? Sorry. Hey! Hey, Nate. You remember my sister, Grace. She brought over a movie, isn't that nice ? Love it. Huh ? Love it. Yeah, 'cause-- What is that? Oh-- Oh, that's my roommate. Oh, you have a roommate. Yeah. Don't worry, she's very respectful. Ooh, she-- interesting. Don't worry, she only pees on newspaper. Ooh, in fact, can I borrow that for later? Oh, that's perfect. Ah-choo! Bless you. Bless you. ( slurping ) Mmm. Bow, bow, bow, bow, woo! Jenny! Jenny! Oh, whoa! Jenny, Jenny! I can't hear you! Oh, spin with me! Yes, spin! Jenny-- Whoa! Nate, call me when recess is over. What, it's yummy, it's Vincent's. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Grace. Hey, Nate, how you doing? Good, how are you? Good. I hear you're doing pretty well these days. What do you mean ? Yeah, Jenny's telling everybody. Street Light Press is gearing up to publish your book. That's so sweet. First commandment broken. Three and four. Number five. Number seven! Oh, that's commandment number nine. Fucking fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Nate, is that you ? Jenny. We need to talk. I wanted to talk to you about something, too. Let me get some lights on here. What's up? You go first. Are you sure ? Well, this may sound like a kind of out-there request, but... my family throws a big Thanksgiving dinner every year, and I was thinking that since we've become so close the last few weeks, maybe you could come with me. You think we've gotten close ? Oh my God, yes, Nate. I mean, I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't come here. You have done so much for me and I'll never forget that. I love you. I didn't know you felt that way. Yeah. So what is it you wanted to tell me ? Jenny... We need more orange juice, and it's been a pleasure... and I love you, too. So then you'll come ? Yeah, I'll come. Thank you. You're easy, you're easy. What am I saying ? You're easy. You're-- you're a doll. Here we go, everybody. Wow. You've outdone yourself again. Keep your socks on. Am I drunk or did your mother just use the expression, &quot;Keep your socks on&quot; ? Yes, now you feel my pain. So Nathaniel, I understand you're a novelist. Nate, my father's speaking to you. Oh, forgive me, Mr. Sparks. Nobody's called me Nathaniel since my third-grade teacher, Mrs. Dunche, and needless to say, I hated her. But yes, I was in advertising many years and I just left to write my first novel. Good for you. So what's the book about ? Yeah, yeah, Nate, tell us about your novel. No, nobody wants to hear that. No, it's great, you guys are gonna love it. Nate is brilliant. No, no, no, Jennifer, don't force the man. If he's too uncertain to give his ideas and beliefs to the rest of the table, we understand. It's a deconstruction of modern society with a slant on needs over wants with a science-fiction twist. ( woman ) I love science-fiction. Yeah, doesn't it sound great ? I'm not sure I follow. Well, Mrs. Sparks-- It's Lily. Lily. It's complicated thematically, but I believe a person-- Could you please pass the gravy ? So, Jennifer, when are you gonna sell the apartment ? Actually, I haven't decided what I'm gonna do with it yet. I'm thinking maybe I'll hang onto it 'til the market recovers. Well, perhaps I should sell it for you. Or perhaps I'm okay on my own. I disagree. Since Bud's passing, God rest his soul, you're obviously regressed. Actually, I'm fine. So you call shacking up in a downtown loft with a middle-aged dilettante fine ? This dilettante, who happens to be extremely talented, had the courage to give up his cushy advertising job to go pursue his dreams, which is more than I can say for any of us. Not to mention, he has given me more support in the last two months than either of you. And we haven't given you any support ? You guys live 40 minutes away. You think you'd at least come to check on me in the city once in person to make sure I was okay. But I guess all your worrying wouldn't let you do that. Jenny, relax. What ? You know your mother gets carsick when she goes over the bridge. Jenny, you know I get sick. Really ? You get too sick to call me too, Mother ? ( Grace ) Jenny ! I've been busy. Yeah, busy avoiding me. We just feel so badly about what happened. We wouldn't know what to say. We didn't want to upset you. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, you guys, you've done a bang-up job. Oh, come on, sit down. ( Grace ) Don't go, it's Thanksgiving. Guys, this is like Palm Springs all over again. Not you, not you... Good heavens. Oh, great, that's Thanksgiving ruined. I suppose you find that funny. No, sir, I don't. Excuse me. ( knocking ) You all right? Come in. Jenny. Those things you said down there-- Don't worry about it. They meant a lot to me. I'm glad. Can I ask you a personal question? What? Am I middle-aged? Yes. But isn't 70 middle-aged? I got a train schedule. Let's get the hell out of here. I wanna do something first. What? Make love. I-- I want to, I mean it. Think about what you're saying. Jenny... You've defied every one of the commandments and I... I haven't stopped being able to think about you. We still... shouldn't do this. Oh, make love to me and let's forget everything. We haven't disregarded all the commandments. Oh, let's forget that you're Nate and I'm Jenny and this is a terrible idea. Mmm, I guess we haven't defied number ten. &quot;Thou shalt not covet thy roommate.&quot; Where are they already? This dinner's ruined. ( Jenny moaning ) Get it! Get it! Sounds like Jenny's gotten over it. What ? I have a confession to make. You're not 25 and a millionaire? Sorry to disappoint you. What is it? I didn't quit my job. I got fired. In fact... I got fired from most of my jobs at the end. Sorry. Oopsy-daisy, look what I did. Excuse me? &quot;Oopsy-daisy, look what I did.&quot; That's what I've been hanging onto for all these years. It's the catchphrase that made me famous. Oh. It's just so stupid. You know what's so funny? I didn't write it. I said, &quot;Whoopsy-daisy,&quot; and some kid in my office knocked on my door and said, &quot;Nate, why don't you try 'oopsy' instead of 'whoopsy'?&quot; Oopsy's better. I know. Sometimes it doesn't matter how you get there. Where'd you come from? Westchester. ( Jenny ) Tonight would be great. Oh, oh, oh, yes, yes. Oh, my gosh, thank you so much, sweetie. I really appreciate it. I'll see you then. Bye. Morning. Morning. Guess what we're doing tonight ? Ordering in and staying in bed? We are having drinks with Douglas and Adi. Why in the name of everything that's good and kind would we do that ? Because I'm gonna get Douglas to introduce you to Walter Evans. You said yourself Walter's gonna love your book, right? But Adi shouldn't know anything about anything. What happens in the loft stays in the loft. What about what happened at your parents' house? You know what I mean. Or what happened on the train. Oh, would you stop it? ( Nate ) It takes like four months to even get a reservation here. You can't even call up, there's no phone number. It's unlisted. Wow, velvet rope, I mean, gosh. There must have been 100 people out there, very impressive. The guy who owns this place, friend of mine. Oh, really? I wonder if they have hot toddies here. Ooh, I love hot toddies. Hot toddy, such a great winter drink. And hot toddy, I love to say the word &quot;hot toddy.&quot; Hot toddy, hot toddy. It's like a Pink Lady or, um... or a Rob Roy. Jack and Coke. I'll have a Jack and Coke. Oh, yeah, &quot;I'll have a Jack and Coke, please.&quot; Okay, a Jack and Coke and what else? ( Douglas ) No, no, our friend was just being a little pedestrian. We'll have four hot toddies, please, and a new shirt for the Marlboro Man. Four hot toddies. So have you guys seen the Helmut Newton exhibit at the Guggenheim? It's amazing. He's the fashion photographer from the '60s. He used to shoot for &quot;Playboy&quot; early in his career. I don't think I was being pedestrian. I thought I was being cute and charming, maybe whimsical, but I didn't think I was being pedestrian. So, Nate, why don't you tell us what's going on with your book? Wait, no. Pedestrian, the definition of &quot;pedestrian&quot; would be boring, ordinary, run-of-the-mill. I wasn't being any of those things. Drop it, Nate. Drop what ? A man describes another man, he should be responsible for that description, am I right ? Play nice. Play nice? I am playing nice. I mean, what is a bore anyway ? A bore is a person whose actions and reactions are totally predictable. A bore is a person who's so enamored with themselves that when the conversation veers away from their own interests, they start to look around the room and see if there's a finer piece of ass then the one they're with. Wouldn't you agree, Douglas? Hmm? Whatever you say, champ. You're being a dick. Um, Jenny, would you like to go to the restroom with me, please? I'd love to. So do you &quot;twatter&quot;? Twitter? What ? You're fucking him, aren't you? I don't know what you're talking about. Air-dry them, lady. Sorry. Don't give me that shit, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I really don't. &quot;Ooh, I really don't.&quot; Please, I see the way you're putting your hand on his knee, telling him what to do, calling him a dick. God, you remind me of my parents, for God's sake. It just happened, I'm sorry. When? A few nights ago. A few nights ago? And you have the nerve to sit here and talk to me like nothing even happened? Uh, I beg your pardon, but you were the one that pushed me to move in with him in the first place. That was different, there's a big difference between living with someone and fucking them. Oh, my God, come on, Adi. You had to know in the back of your mind that something like this might happen. Actually, I really didn't, but apparently, you did. Okay, well, what if I did? Nate has been good to me. He's been good for me. Okay... okay. Fair enough. You deserve that, especially now. But understand this. I see the way he's looking at you. I hear the way he's talking to you. He's in love. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Well, if you think otherwise, then you're the one that's being ridiculous. Come on. Let's get out there before the guys kill each other. Right? Can't do better than that. ( Douglas ) Eli's the best thing to happen to that team since Lawrence Taylor. Oh, you know, he's got the best arm... What's going on here? ... I love the way he's playing this season. I don't know, but it scares me. ... On fire! Hot toddy? To you. Sloshball, baby, I love it. Fucking love it! Let's do this! I really appreciate you taking me here, Douglas. Man, I'm glad we're hanging out. Thanks. It's cool. So how do you play this game? It's easy, &quot;brosef.&quot; You play the entire game holding a cup of beer. The cup has got to be half-full the whole game. And the best part about it is when you get a first down. You chug! What happens when you get a touchdown? You chug! You chug! That's cool. Yeah, it's cool. We get wasted and our wives can't say shit about it. Yo, Walt! Come here. This is my good buddy, Nate Shepherd, right here. Doug. Hey, Nate, how you doing? Thanks for having me. Nate is actually a writer, and he has a book being considered by your publishing house right now. Uh-huh. This guy Barry-- Jones. Barry Jones is loving it. Right. How's your game? It's pretty good. What position you play? Used to be quarterback in high school. Well, that's my spot, so you be receiver. Cool? Sure, okay. I'm telling you, Barry Jones loves his book. Yeah, I heard the first time, Doug. Douglas. Don't be a pussy! How do you know this guy? Well, we have a mutual friend. I used to date a girl-- He used to date my fiancée. Fiancée? Yeah. After drinks the other night, we got engaged. Oh... Well, you know Adi. She was talking about whether I was gonna buy a ring and this and that and-- Oh, so you're not officially engaged. The next morning, we went down to Tiffany's. She picked out a 4-karat Princess-cut. Beautiful. Spent a few more shekels than I planned, but you know Adi. Yeah, I know Adi. Hey, congrats, Doug. You know what? You play with the red team. Red? Red, come on. You'll be with me. All right, who do you want me to cover? Who do you think? ( phone ringing ) ( Sam ) You've reached the man of Steele. Hit the beep. Ready? ( all ) Yeah! ( all ) Yeah! Sloshball! Sloshball! ( all shouting ) Hey, hey, hey! Supposed to be a little game. ( whistle blowing ) ( all shouting ) ( man ) Hey, hey ! ( all shouting ) ( whistle blowing ) ( cheering ) Fucking engagement. Fucking ring. Fucking... All right, I apologize. ( man ) Hike ! ( Walt ) Nice playing there, Tyson. I don't suppose I'll be asked back next year. Oh, don't sweat it, bro, Doug's fine. He was mumbling something about &quot;emergency room&quot; and &quot;lawsuit.&quot; I can't afford that. I just wish one week would go by that guy didn't threaten somebody with a lawsuit. Fact is, it's a friend of his, but live and learn. I don't know if I'm a friend, but I sure do feel like the ugly girl at the dance. I thought it was pretty funny. You reminded me of my younger brother. My kid brother could not play touch football with me without getting into a fight, I'm telling you. Are you close with him ? Not really. Your ex, she must be some kind of woman for the two of you to be fighting over her. Not really. Well, take my word. You find a good one, you gotta hang onto her. Don't fuck it up. You know, I worked hard all my life and it's paid off. At the end of the day, I go home and it's just me, you know what I mean? Yeah, I do. Okay, take care of yourself. You said it's Barry Jones has your novel? Yeah. Does that mean you're gonna read it now? No. I'll just see what he thinks of it. If he likes it, maybe I'll have a look-see. I appreciate it, Walter. It's Walt. My pleasure. Alex, I'm sorry I'm late. Very late. So you had a good talk with Walter. I thought so. Well, apparently, you're invited to his home for the launch party and reading of Street Light Press' latest book. That's great, right ? Better than great, Nate, this is huge. Walter Evans always announces the next book he's going to publish at the reading and launch party of his latest book, so-- Wait a minute, you're telling me that-- Well, Barry did give you a glowing recommendation and he said that Walter read it in one night, so-- Oh, you're kidding me! That means they're gonna publish my novel? Oh, I can't believe this is happening! Oh, it's happening, handsome. Where you going? I am going to lunch. Ciao. ( Sam ) Please hit the beep. Hey, Sam, it's me, Jenny... Sparks. Listen... I wanted to ask you a few questions about that last night when you and Buddy went out. ( Nate ) Hey, I've got amazing news! So let me call you back later, thanks. What is going on? I would like to ask you a question. What are you doing the 15th of this month? Um... I have no idea. Well, you lucky girl, you have been invited with myself to Walter Evans' penthouse for the Street Light Press book-launching party. That's great! Yeah, what do you think? Oh, that's great! Isn't that amazing! Nate! Oh, wait! I'm gonna be wearing this, what do you think? No! ( cell phone ringing ) Hello? ( Sam ) Hey, Jenny, it's Sam Steele. Oh, Sam, thank you so much for getting back to me. Listen, if you wanna meet, we gotta do it tonight. Tonight? I'm actually at the dry cleaner picking up a dress. I have an event tonight, but can you meet me tomorrow? I can't do tomorrow. I'm getting on a plane later on tonight. Are you sure? Y eah, I'm sure, Jen. Um... What about late tonight? No, it's now or never, I'm sorry. Uh... Where are you? Corner of 13th and University, the southeast corner. Okay, okay, I'll meet you there. All right, see you in a bit. Bye. Sorry, Nate. ( doorbell ringing ) Coming. Wow. So this shithole doesn't look so shithole-y anymore. That's an improvement. Adi, why are you here? I'm looking for Jenny. Call her cell. I did. It's been going straight to voicemail all day. Usually when she's upset about something, she turns it off, so. She does? You didn't know that about your little Jenny-wenny? Hmm? What's wrong with you? Why can't you be normal? What? I am normal. What are you doing? I'm waiting. I don't know where she is. We have a party later. It's an important evening for me, so. Street Light Press book reading. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard all about it from Douglas. And I heard you got engaged. Congratulations. Now you get to be in a loveless marriage for cash. Thanks. You wait if you want-- I'm gonna get dressed. Do you mind if I make a drink? Whatever you'd like, Adi. Should I make two? ( clearing throat ) Jesus Christ, Adi, what are you doing ? Go back to work yet ? No, you? No. I was shocked you were actually in New York. Just can't get that night out of my head, you know. Tell me what happened, Sam. Not much more to it from my end. Maybe she can help you out. This isn't what I expected. Are you sure you want to know? I don't know if I'll ever be happy if I don't find out. Okay. Okay, but this is as far as I go. Seriously, Jenny, I mean, what happened to Buddy was fucked up, but... I can't blame myself forever. I hope this sets us straight. We're straight. Good luck, Sam. Yeah, you too. What about Douglas ? Oh, forget Douglas, he's a child. Always has to be told what to do. I need a man who knows what he wants. How about you, Nate? You know what you want. What about Jenny? Ugh, now you sound like Buddy. What? What'd you just say? I didn't say anything. What, come on. What? What? What is the problem? The problem is you're the devil and you're in my home. What? You were with him that night, weren't you? Excuse me? Oh, this makes total sense-- with Buddy. Are you kidding me or what? Was this the first time you were together? I bet it wasn't, was it? You're being paranoid, Nate. How did you do it? Did you call him and tell him that you'd meet him at his house or did you text him because you couldn't hear him at the club? How'd it work? Is this a joke? And what about when he was doing coke, were you there ? Did you see him do this ? Did you see him get out of it? What happened, Adi? I was with Douglas the night Buddy died. No, I watched you. Douglas left right after you kissed him. That was about 10:00 p.m. Buddy died long after that. Adi... Adi, it was you. Admit it. You're nuts. You're nuts. ( bell dinging ) Sometimes it doesn't matter how you get there. Excuse me. Are you Raines Albright? Yeah. Can I talk to you for a minute ? Oh, yeah, it looks great. I love what you've done with the place. Oh, thanks. This mask was from my third trip to Congo. Nate, you need to relax, have a drink. Have a cocktail. Have you said hello to Walter yet ? Yeah, you gotta go over and talk to him. It's common courtesy. I'm waiting for my friend. For who? She's late. She? My roommate. Oh, the... spinning Jenny? Some kissing. Actually, a lot of kissing, but that was mostly me. I tried talking to him, but he was pretty out of it. We both were. And then, well, he just left. So you didn't have sex? Sex? No. He got a phone call and took off. So when did you guys go back to the apartment? When did you call 9-1-1? What? I never called 9-1-1 or went anywhere with him. Wait, what are you talking about? Oh, um... I am so sorry for just showing up like this, I really should let you go. Yeah, no problem. But you should know, it seems to me like he loves you a lot. Yeah. I suppose I do. Maybe just for courage. Hey, how are you? Where is she? It's 10:00, where could she be? Whoa. I want to talk to Walter. You need to relax. Seriously. We're going upstairs-- now, go. Turn around, go. God, you're a mess. Come on. This shouldn't take long. I cannot believe she would be messing with my head like this. If Jenny is not dead, I will be seriously pissed. Okay, sweetie, you've got to pull it together, for God's sakes. Alexandra, yes, but you just don't understand-- What, Nate, what? What does she make you, does she make you... Oh, does she make you feel like a better man? Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes, she does. Nathaniel, listen to me. You are amazing. You are talented, you are charming, and if you were not, would I be doing this? Alexandra. Oh, come on. Don't tell me you haven't felt it, too. It's like pure electricity every time we're in a room together. No, that's-- that's static. What are you saying? I'm saying that... maybe we should keep this relationship professional. Don't you think ? I think... you just missed out on a million-dollar blowjob, buddy. I do things with my toes. What the hell is up with this night ? ( Nate ) Alexandra, Alexandra! I feel terrible. Just-- um, no, just-- Bye. Hey, Nate ! Oh ! I was afraid you weren't gonna make it. No, I'm here. Thank you so much for throwing this party. Oh, sure. It's surreal. How do you mean ? I mean, well, the apartment, you. This mask. It's like something out of a snobby F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. Snobby ? Not snobby, just, um... Lighten up, get another drink. Let me talk to you in a minute. Thanks... Walter, I just-- Excuse me. I was just wondering, when are you gonna make the big announcement? Excuse me? About my book. I'm sorry, I really don't know what you're talking about. When you're gonna announce that you're publishing my novel? I really don't know where you heard that. I passed on your novel. What ? It was a little dated. Dated? It was a little heady. You really need to write from your heart. But why did you invite me here ? I passed on your novel. I didn't pass on you. You're a great guy! Nate. Are you okay? I hope you brought the smokes because I definitely have you beat this time. Why? What happened? My dog died. His name was Scruffy. Seriously. Okay. When you didn't show up tonight, Jenny, I began drinking. When my so-called agent made a pass at me, I turned her down and she dropped me as a client. Then I inadvertently insulted Walter Evans. He was a gentleman, but... he told me that Street Light passed on my book, my novel. Oh... That was my night. What about your night? I-- I'm sorry. Where were you?! I'm sorry I wasn't there, but I finally went to go see that girl that Buddy was with. What? The girl that he was with that night. The girl? You went looking for a girl on the most important night of my life? You were right, I needed to go hear it for myself. It turns out, she never even went home with Buddy. I don't know who called 9-1-1, it might've been a neighbor or something, but don't you see? Buddy didn't cheat on me. Of course he did! What? If you ask me, my money's on Adi. Wait a sec, wait. How long have you thought this? Wait! Why didn't you say something? Oh, my God, why didn't you tell me? You just wanted to fuck me or something? Is that what's going on here ? No, I fucked you before I knew. So you knew. You knew and fucked me instead of telling me? Oh, my God. What does it matter? It was your first commandment! You made me swear on it right here, okay ? And now, tonight, you go on a... manhunt ! Oh, my God, Buddy was the love of my life, I'm sorry if you can't handle that. Oh, please, stop reinventing history! Excuse me? You were in a fight the first night we met! We were not! Yes, of course you were, that's how you won the cigarette ! Oh, my God, couples fight ! Buddy was the one. Buddy was an asshole. Talk about reinventing history. Tonight was the most important night of your life ? That is bullshit. You told me yourself you were fired. You-- It was never your dream to write a stupid novel. This is just your lame-assed attempt to not look like a loser. Whatever happened to &quot;it doesn't matter how you get there&quot; ? Sometimes it does, I guess. I'm-- I'm sorry, Nate, it's not you, it's-- Don't... don't... Don't belittle this. I really am sorry. Please just let me go. ( Adi ) Jenny ? Can we talk, sweetie ? ( Nate ) Hey. I got your message. I'm glad. I didn't know Buddy, Jenny, and I shouldn't have said the things I did. I'm sure he loved you. I'm certain he was a good man. He was, at times. I heard Ballantine Press is publishing your novel. Yeah. But it's a new novel. Really ? Yeah. Wow. What's it about ? A man and a woman move in together because they're both in a jam. And they think that nothing really will change from it, but it turns out, everything changes. Sounds good. I hope so. When did you write it ? I started the night you left. I finally remembered why Buddy likes the lights best when they're blue. Really ? He said when they didn't have a particular reason to go with a specific color, they'd go with blue. Red and green for Christmas, white for New Year's, yellow for Easter. But when they didn't have anything going on, they'd go blue. You forgot that ? Yeah. But I remember now. I remember a lot of things. ( typing ) I guess some workers must have left this stuff up here. Smoke ? No, I actually quit. Me too. Ooh. We're gonna break it. So what do we do now ? Huh. Finished. Save. I did it. Yeah! I did it! Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes-- oh, oh, my God! Oh no! Oh no, no! No, no! No! Please, no! Oh... Oh, thank God. I gotta back this up. Oh. ♪ Is the right time ♪ And when the weather's bad she can share my pad ♪ And we'll talk it out ♪ And when the weather's bad she can share my pad ♪ And we'll work it out ♪ When she's there ♪ And when she's there ♪ It's the right time
