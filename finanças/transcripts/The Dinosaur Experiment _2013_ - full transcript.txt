My name is Abbi Whitecloud. I'm just shy of my 22nd birthday and I live in the godforsaken town of Fossil Ridge, Texas. With one gas station and a main street. We're a hundred miles from the closest to the big city of Abilene, place I was named after. And where I plan to head to as soon as I can. I just wanna get outta here and become one of those famous singers. The kind of singers that get so big they forget where they came from. I'm a direct descendant of Chief Kochese. At least that's what my mom said, who was a keeper of our native traditions. She said my stubbornness comes from him. Maybe even my skills as a bow hunter too. Six months ago, my mom was out in the forest, praying to the great spirit, praying for a better life for us. Traitor didn't help us that day. I hope Beth's not so mad at me. I know she gonna be mad at me! Ahh, I'm gonna feed ya. I just hope that Beth is not gonna be too upset with me. Uh-uh... ohh, no! Here ya go, Beth, I got some good meat for you, Beth. Oh, Beth, don't do that to me. Don't you know me, Beth? I'm like your daddy, Beth. When you were just a little girl I used to hold you close. And sometimes you'd come and you'd crawl in my bed. Hey, Beth, do you remember when Mrs. Cane was mad at me and she was yellin' at me and throwing things at me? Oh, and she went down so easy, Beth. You remember that? I'll always take care of you 'cause I love you, Beth. Now as Texas Sheriffs, still investigating the death of a Native American woman that took place just outside of town. We'll continue to share all information as it's released. This is WKEZ, here's the latest from Marty Mitchell. Abbi? Abbi, you're late! Now you get down here! Oh, and your uniform is in a package on the front doorstep. Today already sucks! But in this class today we've got a very important question. A very important question to ask. And that question is when... did man become upright? Ha-ha, last night, baby! - Mr. Young? - Yes, sir. You know, that would be a short subject, that would be in Anderson Hall... Literature. So, class, no longer do we ask when... Mr. Young's answered that question for us. Now we ask the question, why? Hey, Sheldon... Sheldon. - Wouldn't it have been amazing. - Sheldon. I know you hear me... Sheldon. To be there to see Astropigsafaconis - upright for the first time? - Sheldon. - What?! - I got it. - I don't care, we're not going. - We're going to Taos, we're going skiing. Not this year, leave me alone! Leave me alone! - Sheldon! - So, the question, why did man become upright? It's simple, class... survival. Need a lift? Yeah, gotta head to Billy Waynes. Billy Waynes? Thanks. Guess my mom should have bought a certified pre-owned vehicle. You know, something with a multi-point inspection. I'm thinking about sellin' the place. Gettin' out of this godforsaken town. You know, I was sure sorry when I heard about your mom. I don't want to talk about that right now, though. Professor... Bro-linsworth he's gonna flunk you. You need to leave him alone. You act like I need this crap, man! I'm gonna do like my old man did. Pyramid schemes, limited partners and white collar crime. It's the only way to go. I don't go to school for this crap, man... honestly. Now, that right there is the whole purpose of continuing your education. That's seven million years of evolution calling out to me just saying, Lucas, multiply the human race. What are you doing with my mom's station wagon, man? Details, details, I've got a surprise for you. - Come look in the back. - No! No! No, we cannot take this on the trip! We're not doin' it, man! Are you crazy?! - Surprise? - Oh, no! Is that beast? Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Lucas. What an animal, gotta love him though, right? All right, imagine this, tonight, me and you at the Taos Mountain Ski Resort. Four girls, eight titties, and I'm gonna have 'em in your face, man. Girls are gonna be, bl-bl-bl all in your face... why? Because, I'm the titty man, and the titty man never disappoints. You ready? 'Cause your chariot awaits. - I hate you! - How can you hate me? We're going to Taos. Evelyn, my Evelyn Pprettiest butt, I've ever seen, Evelyn Hey, boy... boy, listen. We need some more of that secret ingredient now. - Possum. - No, son, squirrel! I've gotta have squirrel son! I've gotta have squirrel! - That's it boy - Squirrel. Now, go on out there and get me some squirrel. Go on now, boy! This wasn't part of the bargain. Billy. I'm sorry... did you say somethin' to me? I'm not wearin' this crap anymore. Now, if I recall, I believe your momma bought a truck from me. Now, I'm sorry that she's dead and all, but y'all have a few more payments to go. So... until you're holdin' the title to that fine automobile, in them sweet, little hands of yours, you'll wear what I tell ya. Get on over there to table number four, now get! Hey, Abbi, you know, you oughta hook up with that mad doctor. I hear he and you ain't never gonna hum a tune, bitch! How ya'll doin'? I know you're so lucky, so lucky, sooo lucky to be entertained this evening by little Willie and the Willettes. Here we go babies, ready, 1, 2... 1-2-3-4. - Chocolate, butterscotch - Baby, let's make it swirl, Chocolate, butterscotch Now, we're gonna rock your world. I got a sweet tooth for a Twinkie like you. Now, I'ma callin' the NAA-ASPCA on y'all. What about the NRA? Ah... we're gonna die! We were just leavin'. It was really nice meeting you. She gonna write, she gonna write, she'll call you, she'll send you an email. C'mon girl! Bye! I'm the titty-man, titty-man, titty-man You're not the titty-man, I'm the titty-man, I get the nipple. - Lucas, where are we goin', man? Oh, bro, chill out man, you're the Goose, I'm the Maverick... I'm in control baby, I got the wheel. Oh, beast, come on man! Oh, gross! No matter what I do, I can live to 200 years old, and never run out of stuff. - What stuff? Don't act stupid, my stuff. Really, what, what are you talking about, man? Love goo. - Love goo? Baby batter. Baby batter, man, that's a good one, bro. So, it's pretty safe to assume that your life's ambition is to, uh, run out of sperm. - Exactly. - Okay. Marcus, what's up? No, I haven't seen him. Well, I haven't checked my email yet. I'll get it up right now. Got it, I'll call you back. What was that about? There was a killing... In this town called Fossil Ridge, Texas. - Somethin' weird about it. - How so? They found the remains that was killed by an animal, a large animal. They can't figure out what type. What is it, some type of chupacabra crap? - What? - Every time one of these podunk hicks gets killed by some rabid dog, they say it's space aliens or some crap, and then they call us. Well, if they didn't call us, you'd be out of a job, my man. Just because you believe this crazy crap, don't expect me to. I don't give a damn what you believe, O'Reilly. Do you know why I'm here? This is just punishment, for me screwing the bureau chief's daughter. This is just my version of Siberia. Well, if you think this place is remote, get packing 'cause we're going to the boonies, and we're driving. Driving? The nearest town is 200 miles from an airport. Great, great, that's perfect. Shalom chaver, let's go. Woo! I love this commercial! And I love you, too, Josie, baby. - You love everything. - Ugh, kiss my butt. You look like you should be shopping at the Goth-K, with all that stuff you got on. - Um, Willie? - Mm-hmm? If you see a Slut-Mart along the way, make sure we stop and drop off little Josie. She needs to get some new clothes. Girl! You better hush your mouth, you little cracker zombie. You better quit picking on Josie. Josie, I love you, baby! You better stop talking about her. Right now. You know, I really do think you should change your outfit. Black does not compliment your skin tone. I happen to like my skin tone, and what I'm wearing looks a lot better than your little hooker skirt ya got on. What! It is not a hooker skirt, and I look fine. Hey, we goin' to LA, baby. We gonna lay out on the beach, and we gonna get a tan! It's gonna be so much fun. - Lucas? - Yeah, bro? Did you know we were almost out of gas? No. Why didn't you fill up the tank, Lucas? You had $24 last year. How much you got this year? I'm not gonna lie to you, man, I just ain't got no cash. We have to put this all on my card. - Exactly. - You are an asshole. You love me, though. - You know what I'm gonna do, child? - What? I'm gonna pull over to the next gas station, and I'ma get us a big ol' box of Twinkies. - That's what I'm gonna do. - I love Twinkies! Do you know what he's talking about? - Uh, yeah, Twinkies. - Uh, not that kind. - Willie's talking about cute guys. - Well, I like cute guys. That's cute, little, white men. That's what I like, cute, little, white men. Me and Josie both like cute, little, white men. Thank you very much. - Oh, my God, you fat fuck. - What is that? - Beast! - What? - Man! - Gah, what is the matter with you? Is that me? What is that smell? Ya'll smell that? What is that? Damn! Ooh! Yeah, we're about 20 minutes away. Okay, see ya there? CSI's already on the scene. When we get there, let's make sure that we tell... Oh, my God! Was that you? - Nope. - It's even worse out there. Why does it always stink out in these places? - Oh, my God... - Dude! It's not me! That's not me this time! Oh, my God. - Dude! No, I... - You need to see a doctor. No, no, no. I have been with my own scent, for 23 years, and I know that's not me! Atwood. Agents, how was the drive? Don't ask. Okay. How ya'll doin'? I'm Sheriff Morgan. I'm Deputy Jones. Sheriffs, I'm Special Agent Logan, and this is O'Reilly. Special Agent O'Reilly. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - You have a chance to check anything out yet? - No. Well, in all my years, I've never seen anything like this before. We've had some very unusual killing. You know, cattle missing and stuff, but there's never been anything left. I'm talking no remains, - but now... - He's right. This? This is very unusual. The teeth marks indicate a very large predator-type creature. By creature, you mean like, a dog or a wolf? Sure, if the dog's about ten feet tall. Actually, over by the creek, we have some very strange footprints. If you can call them feet. So, we talking about a canine? No. I mean, I don't know. We'll still need to run some tests, and do the DNA. Still, really have a lot of work here. The arm looks of African American descent, but what's odd, is how clean it severed, but here's the crazy thing... that... doesn't look like any dog print I've ever seen. What the hell? Yeah, I know. - Doggy want a bone? - Give you my number anytime. Well, if it ain't Dr. Cane. You been doin' a little huntin' there, doc? Cold front's moving through, and I'm gonna need all your gas for my generators. Say, Abbi. It looks like Dr. Cane's windshield could use a little cleaning. So, if you don't mind... You know, when we say service here, Billy Wayne's Swing 'N' Dine, we mean service. Yeah! Woo! What the hell you think he's raising out there, Billy? Some of them flesh eating emu? Nah, that's ridiculous. Ah, Sheriff. I think we're gonna have to wait a few more days. Uh, there's a lodge about 15 miles back up the road, not too far from the station. Great. I-I know I don't have to tell you this, but... Don't worry, Agent Logan. We know not to say a word. I'm heading back to Quantico now. We've got all we can get here. The rest is lab work. We'll need you guys to keep this area under lockdown. Until our people get here tomorrow morning. - Sure, no problem. - Thank you. Oh, Abbi... Abbi... You know, I'll be damned if I didn't spend my whole life researching, and now I can't live, to the day that I'm able to share it with the world. You know, Abbie, life is, is ironic. Whatever you decide to do, you give it your best. Take care, Dr. Cane. Good call. How you boys doin'? What can I get for you? Coffee. Same. Where ya guys in from? Oh, we're just rollin' through, ma'am. You're here 'cause the killings, huh? Just a routine investigation. You can stop with the charade. Everyone knows something's going on around here. What do you mean? Carri Anne! They're gonna find out eventually! Carri Anne, can I speak to you now? Do not say a word to these guys. They can get us into a lot of trouble. We could lose everything. Now, go out there and just serve them coffee. Don't say a word! We don't wanna draw any attention. Well, like I said, it's just routine. - If I were you, I'd go to Old Man Cane's... - That's enough. - They need... - That's enough! You guys eating or what? - Chicken fried steak. - Same. Good choice. Oh, Lord, is it, is that smoke? No, no, no, no, no, no! No, man, we gotta get to LA, baby, no, no, no, no, you can't be smokin'! - No, no, no, no! - Fix the damn thing! I cannot fix the damn thing! Girl, who you talkin' to! My name is Little Willie! You talkin' 'bout manicure or a pedicure, I'm your man, but you talkin' about somethin' mechanical, I ain't your man. Oh, look, look! There's a town back there! And we missed it. There's definitely something going on here. Three people going missing in three months? Not to mention, seven dogs and more than a dozen cattle? It's the blood sucker chupacabra! Will you not be an idiot? I mean, come on. You gotta see there's something wrong here. I mean, what does that mean? Is it something supernatural? I mean, it could be a number of things. Really? What? Um... I'm listening. - Aliens. - Oh, for Christ's sake. Not those type of aliens. Illegal aliens or drug runners. Drug runners with six-inch teeth? That eat people? Come on, man! We gotta see the whole picture, embrace all the possibilities. That waitress said something about an Old Man Cane's place, right? Let's go there, first thing in the morning. Bro, you just need to chill, alright, it's not my fault. Yes, it is, man! If you would've just swallowed your freakin' pride, and just admitted that we were out of gas, then we wouldn't be here in the first place. Look, uh, what's that say? "Fossil Ridge?" It's a town, alright? I'm sure they got a gas station. Well, yeah, I hope they do. Uh... Where are we? Dude, look, he's covered in blood. This is bullshit! Hey, bro, if we were flowin', that right there would've been the senior we'd missed. Just shut up! Let's just get some gas. What? Howdy, boys! Ya'll here for some of Billy's famous pulled pork? Still got a little bit in the back. I think we're gonna pass. So, ya'll ain't hungry? Ya'll don't need anything inside? Uh, not at this time, man. All we need is some gas, and then, we'll be out of here. Looks like ya'll ain't goin' anywhere soon. What do you mean? We just need some gas, man! Yeah, bro! This shaggin' wagon needs fuel! Ya'll are shit out of luck. What the asshole is tellin' you, we ain't got no gas. Oof! What the hell is that? Ooh, this town is so lucky! Ooh, this town is so lucky! Fossil Ridge? Who's that? - Uh, excuse me, sir. - Thank you. Do you have a mechanical type-like individual that can be workin' on my bus? You see, it broke down, and we really need to be movin' on down the road. We got a big show that we need to be gettin' on at, and we love... Ooh... Would you happen to be the little mechanical type-like man? No, we just need some gas, man. Well, what's wrong with the gas here? You need, uh, some supreme plus? No... They ran out of gas. They ran out of gas? What's he mean they ran out of gas? What kind of gas station runs out of gas? Oh, my Lord, I don't... what... I don't understand it. It says... What the hell was that? That there's comin' from crazy Dr. Cane's place. Some people say he's growing 20 foot meat-eating emus up there. They say he was kicked out of the big city, for doing some sort of freaky-ass experiments. Who knows what he's got up there, but I know this much, he's got all the gas, 'til morning. Good night. Good night? Did he say good night? Does that mean we have to spend the night here? Hey, Abbi! You lock up tonight. Don't even think about it. Um... Uh, excuse me, Mr. Redneck, uh, where are we supposed to sleep? That's a tour bus, ain't it? Sleep in it! W-Wait, wait! Where you goin'? I'm quittin'. You can lock up the place. What! But, w-what are, what are we... wait. No, no, no, wait, stop! Where are you going? Going to my truck. - Wait, you've got a truck? - Yeah, it broke down. W-W-Wait, wait, wait, uh... What about th-this, this doctor guy? - Where's he live? - Dr. Cane? He's pretty reclusive. He doesn't like anybody on his property. N-No, no, no, you don't understand. M-Maybe you could take us there, a-and we could just ask him politely, of course, and maybe we could borrow some gas. Please. Please, take us there. Please. - Alright. - Okay. Run! Lucas! Lucas! - Hey, bro, man. - Lu... Man, you're not gonna believe this. Josie and I, we were in the first grade together. I mean, same class and everything. What was her name, Miss, um... M-Miss Rutledge! Miss Hutchins! Miss Hutchins! Baby, thank you. - You're welcome. - Yeah, her pop got locked up, and they waited for him to get out or something like that. Lucas! We have got to get out of here, man. What? Gotta have my wheat group. Oh! Hi! And other than that girl out there, nobody around here seems right in the head, man. Yoo-hoo! Butterscotch! - He likes you. - Oh, dear Lord. Listen, how about this, why don't you go on without me, by the time you get back, me and my classmate over there, will already be done kissing all over each other, and then I'll be ready to go, - and we can hit those slopes. - Yeah, whatever. Hey, you like the Pulverizers? Yeah! Beast, come on, we're going. Okay. Would you care to join us? On this adventure of ours? Josie You're beautiful Uh, yeah. - I'd be delighted. - After you, my lady. Um, e-excuse me, Mr. Beast Man, but where are you goin'? To meet the mad doctor! What the hell was that? Dirt road? Middle of nowhere? Texas? I've seen this one. Look, maybe we got started on the wrong foot. Let me re-introduce myself. My name is Sheldon Macabeach. I'm of Irish descent. My favorite color is green. You, know, green. Fightin' Irish! My granddad was a veterinarian. Uh, you know, that's like a doctor, except, uh, you know, he works with animals, dogs, cats, other assorted critters. You know, it's great to hear that your life is going so well, and you're not stuck in some shithole town like some of us, but you could do us all a favor. Sure. What? Shut up. Sure. Fine. I guess it's safe to say you weren't exactly, Miss Personality in high school. Hello? So, you ready for this? Hey! Atwood. What you got? Well, the DNA report just came back, but we've got a problem. What kind of problem? Well, it's a bit inconclusive, or better yet, highly impossible. The closest match was that of the dromaeosaurid theropod. - Say that again? - Better known as a velociraptor. Will you say that again 'cause I thought I heard you say raptor. Look, I didn't say it is a raptor, but whatever's out there, is very closely related to a reptile that, hasn't been around since the Cretaceous period. That's over 75 million years ago. Wait, this is incredible. You got that right. Marcus is sending over a small army to quarantine the area. Yeah, sure. One other thing. These things are nocturnal, and one of the most ferocious hunters to ever walk the earth, so whatever you do, stay indoors tonight. I gotta go. They're calling me. I'll talk to you later. Take care of yourself, Logan. Will do, Atwood. Bye. Oh, man, you're not gonna believe this. What? Let's go. Who are ya?! What're you doin' here? Get off my property! You shouldn't be here! Get... Dr. Crane! It's Abbi. - Abbi? - Yes, come on, let's get you up. Abbi! Abbi, what're you doin' here? You're not supposed to be here! Come on, let's get you up, let's get you up. Come on. Come on. Let's get you in the house. We're gonna take you in the house, come on. Oh! Beast, we could really use a hand, man! That's okay, man! Y-You go on ahead. I-I'm gonna stay out here. Maybe it's some sort of a deranged garden gnome. You know, the kind that'll just rip the flesh right off your bones. Now, y-you should all leave now, Abbi. So, you, you take all your little friends, and get 'em off my property. It isn't safe. What's not safe? He just said it's not safe here. Well, it certainly isn't for your friend's fear of yard art. Dr. Cane, we should get you to a hospital. Is there some sort of medication you take? It's upstairs in the attic. - Okay. - But... Whatever you do, don't touch anything, 'cause I haven't finished the feeding, and she's gonna be so mad at me. I get just like Mrs. Cane when I get really hungry, too. I hope that's not Mrs. Cane. Dr. Cane has no wife. She died a long time ago. Well, if he's not talkin' about his wife, who the hell's he talkin' about? I really have no idea. Where are you going? I'm going upstairs to get his medicine. What's that? Hello? Anybody in there? The crack... A crackin'... Ho... Crackin-ho-saurus? A-crackin-ho-saurus! Dr. Cane is it? Can we borrow some gas? Sweet child o' mine! Wait. I think something's happening. Can I sit next to the dead guy in the truck? You guys gotta come check out these bald chickens, man! Is that guy dead? I love you My darling I love you You two need to go get a room. Sounds like a plan to me. Come on, guys, come on! You gotta come check out these crackahosaureseses. You gotta check this out! Those don't look like chickens to me. Let's go! - Chariot awaits. - Ooh! Oh, God. Those weren't no chickens I've ever seen. Yeah, man, those chickens had teeth! That Colonel totally stuffed some steroids up those chickens' necks. I mean, this is seriously the best trip I've ever been on. What? Okay, guys. We gotta get the hell out of here. Look. I didn't wanna say anything, but I saw some really creepy shit, up at Old Man Cane's attic. - What kind of creepy shit? - Don't spaz out on me. We need to get the hell out of here. Listen, I need for you to go to the truck and get my flashlight. Big guy. Gas cans. Can you handle it? - Yeah, yeah, got it. - Alright, go. And I need for you to stay right here, where I can keep an eye on you. Hey, guys! Guys, I found the gas can! Hey, you guys want the lights on out there? So you can see the gas? They can probably use some light. Doors. I love The Doors! Turn it off! Turn the lights back on! Holy shit! Lucas never has to deal with this. No! No! Leave 'em alone! Uh-oh. Is this what you're looking for? What now? That's what I'm talkin' about. Oh my.. Oh! No hugging, kissing, There's not even any foreplay. What's foreplay? Oh yeah. Exactly! Ah, home sweet home. This place looks safe. You've been complaining since we left the convenience store, and all I've been doing is offering you my help. - Oh, help. - You know, if you think you can survive out there, then go, get out of here. - Fine. Fine. I'm done. - Leave. Sheldon. Look. I really don't know what those things are out there, and I don't knot why all this crazy shit is happening, but I do know one thing, we're a lot safer inside than we are out there. Okay. You're right. Ooh! Looks like someone's boyfriends' here. Well! I was just thinkin' about you. Maybe we can have a ménage de du trois. Let's get the hell out of here! If you keep doin' that, girl, you gonna wear that little coochie out. I'm telling' you, girl, if you let that little boy jump up and down in there. That's just tired. That's tired. That ain't cute. It's tired. Runnin' around with that little badass boy. Wait a minute! You look like a pit bull crossbred with a rhino. Hold on there, Mr. Dog. Mr. Dog, I'm just tryin' to go to the bathroom. Oh, yeah, baby! Shut up, dog! I gotta use the bathroom! I ain't got time to be messin' with you! You use the bathroom out there! Little Willie gonna use the bathroom in here! That's right, you better shut up! Who is that? I said go away! Little Willie's in here! Little Willie's in here! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Wait, no, no, no. No, wait, hold on. No, no. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Baby, we're gonna have to call somebody and tell them... Tell them what? You just set a new world record for Lucas, baby. I mean, I've been going for, what now? I don't know. 15, 20 minutes. And to think, we're just getting started. Yes! What was that? Sorry. That was me, I mean, God, it's been 20 minutes. It's my turn now. Atta girl! Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! It's pretty safe to say that after what happened to your boss back there, you don't have to go into work tomorrow. If that thing catches up to us, we're all gonna be on a permanent leave of absence. Did you say something about, seeing something strange up in the guy's attic? I mean, did you happen to come up with some kind of explanation, about how creatures that have been extinct for millions of years, have all of a sudden come back to life, and are chasing our asses all over the place? Don't blame me for all this. If it's anybody's fault, it's yours! My fault? How is it my fault? You know what, if it wasn't for you, I'd be sitting at home right now. The last time I checked, it was my house that got destroyed. You know what? My little fat friend is dead because of all of this, and when I say little, I don't mean little, I'm talking about 400 pounds, citrus soda, snowballs, and nachos, just ripped apart. By what? A blue dinosaur. Blue-zilla! Shh! Guys... Toodle-loo! Where did you come from? No, no! We did not come all the way back to the same place! - We went in a complete circle! - Sheldon! Let's go! What is this? Ah! What? I coulda shot your balls off. Not Josie! Shut your friend up. Right now! Josie! L-Lucas! L-Lucas! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Look at me, look at me! Lookin' turkey, bald-headed, long snout monkey, ostrich bastards! We should really call somebody, bro. We can call the cops! There ain't no cops in this town. Okay. Let's go back to our original plan. We'll get on the bus. Get the hell out of here. Go! Do it! What's wrong with this thing? Okay, okay, okay. I've had a really, really bad day with cars today, so if you don't mind, back up! Who is this girl? Who does she think she is? Start the car! Ah! Nope! Um, excuse me! Um, uh, we're leaving my mom's car. W-W-We're leaving it behind! Uh, what am I gonna do? Either I'm gonna be killed by the dinosaurs, or my mom's gonna kill me. Um, hello, it doesn't matter, we're all gonna die. Thank you Miss Sunshine. You help me a lot. That's a dark road, and I-I don't wanna go down it. Where are we going? We're going through downtown Fossil Ridge, and we're heading to the Interstate. Which way do you wanna go? Left or right? I don't care. That's east or west. East. Girls in Cali are smokin'! Let's go east! Shut up, Lucas! Let's just get the hell out of here, man. Idiot. Oh, that's perfect. I love the smell of burning engine. - Yeah. - I told you all it was a piece of shit. W-What? Perfect! You know, it's the story of my life. Really is. I mean, I coulda stayed at school, done some extracurricular activities. No, had to go skiing with jerk-off here, and now I am out in the middle of nowhere with bossy pants. Sheldon, why don't you do us all a favor, and make yourself useful and shut the back door. You know what, Mrs. Commando, I am not the only soldier in this army here. Why don't you ask one of them two to do something for once? I'm so sick of this! What? - Sheldon! - What? Move it! Okay! Are you happy? Sheldon! Sheldon! Sheldon! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Get it open! This place is so creepy! I kinda feel at home. Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout right there. I think we're gonna be safe, for right now. Why don't you go try the back door? Lucas? Okay. That bad one's out there, and there, that don't sound like any critter I've ever heard before. Stop it! Lucas. Ski buddy. Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Keep it together! No! You want the bone? Come and get it! You like bones! Bones are good! He wants a bone. You wanna play fetch? Fetch? Fetch. You like the bone. Do it! I said "do it," and he did it. He did it? - Lucas! - Sheldon! You're okay! - Open the door! - Sheldon! They're after me, man! Lucas, you are on the inside. Sheldon's on the outside. Open the door. Dumbass. Let me in! Look! There he goes again. Looks like trouble followed us into town. It's the blue one. It's the blue one! It's the bad one! I'm putting my money on the big one. No, no. Forget the big one, it's the small one that can get us, the blue one. How can you say forget the big one? - He just flipped the bus! - Lucas, for once in your life, size doesn't matter, man. What are you talkin' about? Man Beast. Beast Man? What happened? Remember seventh grade football? Vaguely. 18 yard sprint? Yeah. No! No! I know know, man. W-We were running for the truck. I looked behind me, and he wasn't there. How does 370 pounds just up and disappear? I don't know. He just wasn't there. I think he went around to the front of the doctor's house and... - Flamingoes. - Not the flamingoes! Say it ain't so! He chose that blue thing over the flamingoes. I mean, there was just body parts flying all over the place. Please... Just right there. Hmm... Blue! Probably a Megalosaurus. Hm. A large, well-advanced, carnivorous member of the Carnasaura family. They're not sure about the color! Oh, until now! Lived for about 70 million years, middle Jurassic period. Old Blue must be a teenager because, they can grow up to be 30 feet! Does it say in the book how to kill the things? No! But, it says that it was probably a matriarch. Did you hear that? A metra-rock? Matriarch! What's a matriarch? That means females are in charge. Aw, hell no! I ain't putting' up with this shit. I'm gettin' me that gun. This is what I'm talkin' about! - That armor's not gonna protect you Lucas! - Sheldon! When are you gonna grow up and be a man? Honestly! Let's put our skis together, get off the bunny slopes, get on the big boy chair, and we're gonna go to the top of that mountain! Why do we need to go to the top of the mountain? For titties. The whole point, the whole objective of this whole trip, was to do what? Get a titty here and a titty here. Now, I'm not gonna let some little lizard out there, stop me from getting titties! Why? 'Cause I'm the titty man! The big one's interested in the little ma... woman... matriarchial dinosaur, so now is our chance, alright? Besides, they're extinct, and they're stupid. We're human. We're men human. We're smarter. - Lucas. - What? You walk through that door, and you'll be extinct. What do you know? - Don't open the door, man! - It's you and your dumb ass boyfriends' fault, - we're here in the first place. - Lucas, get back in here, man! You need to make up your mind. You gonna listen to Robo-Bitch here or Manson, party of one? It's me, Lucas. Your friend. Your pal. Your amigo. What're you gonna do with a BB gun, Lucas? I'm gonna take his eye out. Oh... Ski buddy... Sorry about your friend. What are you doing? I am fishing. For what? For what? I don't know! But I got one! Come on! You can do it! Come on! We should go back and help him. Hell no! I'm not gonna become a Jurassic snack pack! Maybe we'll be safe in here. There's no way in hell she can figure out how to get in here. Ahh! This is it. This is how the story ends. There's only two of us left. One of us has gotta go. It's gonna be me. Hey, I guess I've been pretty hard on you. Sheldon! Thanks, Mom. This is for you, Mama. It's you and me, bitch! Go to hell! Yo! What was that, man? Was that... Was that an earthquake or something? No, no. Not way the hell out here. That was an explosion. Come on. Let's go check it out. Hey, guys. We got quite a mess on our hands. What was that explosion? The old factory. That's nothing compared to what they found at Fossil Ridge this morning. Remains of... I know this sounds crazy, but those ostriches, they weren't ostriches at all. They're what seems to be... dinosaurs. The real big ones. - Where's Morgan? - He's got Abbi, the daughter of one of the possible victims. Looks like Abbi's the only surviving witness. They're just up the road. There's a whole lot of media up there. Thanks. Is it true that dinosaur-like creatures have been seen in the area? This isn't Jurassic Park. Get real, people! Just mutated, feather-less ostriches that attacked, - these poor folks. - I don't think they're ostriches. Why don't you guys go look for Bigfoot or something. No more questions for now. We need answers! And that's how it happened. I told my story to the FBI, but they didn't believe me. Seems that government officials don't take to the mad ravings of a Native girl. I guess they'd rather write off such incidents, to flesh-eating emus or the Chupacabra. Anyway, eventually they released me, and guess what? I took old Doc Cane's advice. I didn't give up on my dream or my future, but I did give up on my past.
