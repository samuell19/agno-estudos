Think about it: since she hasn't forgotten it, if we get rid of it and she forgets it, it will be up to you to go but first, it will be his since she hasn't forgotten, understood? - I'm not sure. - Trust me. You just saved me and couldn't you trust me? Meow - Okay, okay, let's go. ... - Oh, that's beautiful. - It's okay, hurry up. - Why me ? - It's your plan, then it's you, the bad guy. - Okay, I'm the bad guy. I thought we got past that. That we were no longer there, that we were working as a team. But if I'm the bad guy, I'll take it. No problem. It's weird, it's super heavy all of a sudden. - Is that so ? My poor Pritprout, you're really not athletic. Well, I'll put it there, like that, you will only have the louse ... ... sser. ' Laugh bad - It was my plan from the start. ' Poor naive. ' Melancholy theme ... Whistling ... - Oh... So, this is the dungeon. Oh non, mon legging, it's all dirty now. Pritprout, traitor. ' How i could to trust him ? I have to get out of here. - Is that the prince? - But yes.' - What is that ? - Excellence.' - Who is he? - They are transparent, they are forgotten. - On retrouve, friend. - You know each other ? - Uh ... - He can't remember, everyone forgot about us. - We haven't forgotten you, vermin. ' We're going to finish our discussion. ' - We'll discuss it later, cowboy. How do we get out of here? - Welcome to the "oubliettes"! No one leaves here. - What do you mean, nobody? - No one. If someone says: "There is nobody", if there is nobody, that means that ... - Too long. I will get out of here. - No, it's no. ' You understand ? Not.' NOIN. ' You want to fight ? Go ahead, draw, muchachos. Hm. ' Hm. ' Hm ... - Listen, be nice, go grow your arms. - Poor, you judge me for the "courtesy" of my arms? I'll give you mini-slaps. ' - After. Who told you we couldn't go out? - Prince, we're not getting out of here, period. - Blablabla. ' But who told you that? - That's not who the problem. It has always been like this. I remember... - Too long again. Laughs - Why is he laughing? - We're wasting our time talking with baby characters. - From baby, me? Fight.' - We calm down, we refocus. Who was forgotten first? - The Queen. - Is there a Queen? We're going to see the Queen. - Let's go. ' - Let's go. Let's go, buddies. - We don't know where she is. We forgot. - What do you mean ? - It is the problem of oblivion, at the same time. - Me, there are two things that I can never remember. The first is ... Dirty memory. ' We should be able to return to the past, back when we hadn't forgotten things. - Strangely, I agree with him. To find what we forgot, we must go back in the past, and the past ... it's over there. - Over there ? - No, over there. - Let's go. - So, where are we going? - This way, the past is behind you. Follow me, going before me. - It's not possible, real penguins, these penguins. ' - Hé oh, cow-boy.' It's not like you have gorgeous arms, either. - The characters are more and more babies. We are in the right direction. At the time for me, I did not warn. - "My mistake" ? But listen to me, this poor guy. - Excuse, man. Come on. - Soft foot. - Come on, guys. Let's go on. - Hands of clay and buttocks of velvet. - Poor Prince, that must make him funny to no longer be in a story. - "Poor Prince" ... Gnagnagna. ' ... - I think we've arrived. Yes. We arrived. - Where are we? - We went backwards, we are as far from the past. - I understand nothing. - Ah, still, it's very, very transparent. - Hello, Prince. - Hello Madam. - I knew you would finish by arriving. - Oh no, in fact, I was pushed. So, I'm not supposed to ... - I knew you'd come eventually. - Say something again. - There is no mistake, you belong here. You belong here ... You belong here ... - This voice. - Yes. It's me. It has been a long time. - It was very hard not to see you, you know. - Yes I can imagine. For me too. But I had to disappear. You did very well. - I did my best. You missed me so much. - Who is he? I did not understand. - The Princess's mother. - Oh ok. - You got away both got out well. - Exactly, I have to go out. - We're not getting out of here. - Okay, but me, it's not the same. - Why ? - Already, I should not be there, I was pushed. I have to go. - No, your place is here, next to me. I know, it sounds sad, but ... it's life. We all have to disappear at some point. Soon everyone will be forgotten and everything will disappear. Soon no more Princess. You have to grow up, one day. - No more Princess? Et moi, bloqué ici ? So there is no way out. It's the end of the world. All these stories, so why? Finally forgotten? I'm no better that this woman that I met, the Woman ... at the door. The Woman at the Door. ' I know how to get out of here. The Woman at the Door. ' We go back, straight ahead. ' The Princess will hear me. - You haven't listened to anything. - Yes, but I'm going. - Leave her alone. - I have to save the world. - Always so stubborn. - Sorry excuse me. Adieu. Farewell, the forgotten. I will not keep no memory of you. - Goodbye, Prince. We too will soon forget you. - Farewell, Excellency. ' I did not completely understand. - Penguin, can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Could you scratch my ass? My arms are too short. - Are you sure it's that way? - We do not care. As long as it's that way. By the way, you stay there. You're not coming. Everyone has their own adventure. Me, my adventure awaits me. And she doesn't wait. Do you know each other on the run? - Sofia ran away. - Some kind of runaway. I think she's at this party. Say, without my permission. - Come in. You called her, I imagine. - It's not responding. - Are you worried? - Yes. But not that much. I thought I was angrier. I don't want anything to happen to him. - She'll call you. She knows you are worried. Another drink? - It does not bother you ? - No. - Don't worry, I'm not staying. - Everything is fine. - I wanted to talk to you. * Rap Exclamations of joy - GIFTS.' GIFTS.'

Laughs - Who offered this? Too weird. - It's not me. - Go ahead, open it, your thing. - Let see, what is it? - Come on, watch. - Show me. - Go ahead, show everyone. *... Bursts of laughter - Hey, that's supposed to to be what? - It's you here. I recognize you. - You really have wings. - Half-man, half-pigeon. - Guys, stop it. - But who gave you this shit? - It's me. - Pardon ? - It's me. *... - Excuse us. It's cool. Will you make me one? - Me too, I want one. But with pelican wings. Laughs - I want chicken thighs. ' - Stopped. - Go ahead, put the music back on. *Rap *... - This is new to me. I feel that adolescence is fine ... - I can tell you a story ? When I was little, my parents divorced. My dad was always there, he was a really great dad. Then around 14-15 years old, it started to go wrong. He became unbearable, I didn't understand why. It was when I left that I understood. He had sacrificed everything for me. He hadn't built anything. When I left, I left him some space. But I hadn't asked him to sacrifice himself. His cell phone vibrates. - Sorry, it must be Sofia. Hello? Don't move, I'll be right there. Surely you have a car with your garage problems ? - A motorcycle. - Woman at the Door, I know your role in the story. - I do not have. - Yes. I'm going through this door join the world of stories and the Princess, thanks to you. This is your role. You hear ? What are you doing here ? What did I tell you? - I have to go see the Princess, she needs me. - Are you blocked or what? I am the only one who can approach it within 5 paces, that's the rule. "Capiccio" ? Let's go. - Are you sure ? - Positively certain, it will work. - OK, I trust you. - Ouch. ' - Pardon. Sigh - Well, knock, knock. - Knock Knock. - Who is he? - The prince. - The princes. - Get out. ' Finally, enter. Finally, go outside. Rumbling ... - My God, I hope it's not too late. - We won't get there, it's too far. - You're not up to par, kid. As long as the battle is not lost, the battle is not lost. The Princess is waiting for me. Thank you, Woman at the Door. - Thank you to you, I finally understand my moral. - Is that so ? - Yes. Thanks to trust, all doors can be opened. That's wonderful. And thanks to you, I am useful. You saved me. - Well. About running away, I have to go. Excellent, that. Here.' Pritprout. Meow - Prince ... - Yes, there is never an end. Everything is only twists and turns. - Compared to earlier, it's not what you think. - No, I don't blame you. - Oh, thank you, I'm so happy. ' - Good old Pritprout. It's good. It's good, yes. That's a big hug, that. - What is he doing here? - Oh, help me with him, because I... Hey, you're disappearing. - Yeah, say so. ' - That's great. - Yes, you want to play the guy, but Prince, it's a job, it's talent, it's sweat. To have a career, it is not enough to have small hair. - He is right. At one point, must be erased. - Now that, it's good, what's next? - We go back. Direction the Princess. You don't have to follow us, suddenly. - Don't go too far, the entrance to the oubliettes is right there. ' They laugh. - That's good.' - Did you hear? - Is. My darling.' What happened ? - Sorry, dad, but the helmet is ... Not possible. - What happened ? - Papa... - Let me say two words to these little ... guys. Actually, I don't have the code. Nor the address. I have nothing, actually. - Dad, I'd like to go alone. Can you wait here for five minutes? - No problem. But just in case, I'm here to help. Like always. What? - Nothing, but I knew she was nice, this neighbor. - Whatever. - Good evening, Sofia. - Good evening. Well I'm leaving. See you soon. - CHECK TARTARE.' - "Check tartare", it's very funny. - Oh no, it's ... It's an old thing, it amuses him. A kid's thing. - Yeah. The storm is raging. ... Thank you, Pritprout, for coming with me. ' - Please, my friend, it's quite normal. Who knows what can happen? ... - Max ? - We know each other ? - I'm Sofia's daddy. - Oh yeah... - Little guy, I'll tell you something. No, actually, I'm not going to tell you. You don't even deserve it. - Yes I know. You're right, I suck. - We totally agree. - I did whatever. - Well yeah. Well, finally, already, you realize it. That's not bad. It is even good. It's okay. I won't push him in the arms of my daughter, still. - Not. But you can make an effort. ... - He is still there ? - Yeah. ' We can say what we want, but he is tenacious. - Unbearable, you mean. ' What is he doing ? - I dunno. ... - But what a kid. ' - He wants to tell us something. - You speak.' ... - He's still in good shape, dude. For a guy of 11, can you imagine? - Yeah, good. Of course he's not the bad guy. It's not bad what he did, I admit. ... A second. We stop for a second. ... You're not gonna let go, are you? OKAY. But once we get there I take care of everything and you stay in the back. Considering your physique ... - No, but it's better. - We say that, yes. ... I have a stroke of the pump, me. - Me too. I'm in pain here. I ... I hyperventilate. - I don't know if it's the wind, but it's getting better. Not you ? We're taking a break ? - You laugh ? On the way. At valiant heart nothing impossible. ... What are you doing ? - I'll join you, I take a break. I'll delay you. - You're sure ? - Go ahead, I'm telling you. - I can wait for you. ... - Piss off. - Actually, she's out, I don't know where she is. - You do not know ? She came back up. - Ascent? Up there or against me? - A bit of both. - But she wanted to talk to you. - If it's to get me thrown, frankly... - What do you want to say to him? - I dunno. Pardon. - That's right. It's a start, what. - But no. No, it's not good. It's light, as is. Undeveloped. Find something cool. - Of the kind ? - Make up a great story. At valiant heart nothing impossible. - What? Are you serious ? - Why not ? - Oh, the sentence ... - Otherwise, it's not complicated, just tell him ... You just have to tell him ... No, I don't. I find nothing crazy there. I don't know what I got. - You know, sometimes it's not worth talking, you just have to be there. What matters is how you gonna look at her how are you going to take care of her. Let her know how you see her. - Okay. The storm redoubled in intensity. ... - What is happening ? - I'm tired. - You disappear, too. I came back. Suddenly, it's crazy. ' It's so funny. - Yeah, so funny. I died laughing. - We have to go, we're almost there. Want a helping hand? Come on, lean on me. - Non. Go yourself. I will go next time. - What is happening ? - Nothing. Go join the Princess. Your turn. Your turn, kid. Go ahead, hurry up. You go-y, Prince.

Romantic theme ... - Let's go ? - What about Sofia? - She has my number, if she needs to, she will call. My old Pritprout, it looks like it's over for good. - I do not understand. You said it was never over for good. - I was wrong, you see? Looks like this time this is really the end. - So even you, we can't trust? - I'm sorry, Pritprout. I'm so sorry you believed it. - Can I put my head there? - Of course. Melancholy theme ... A stone tumbles. ... ... ... A cell phone vibrates. ...
