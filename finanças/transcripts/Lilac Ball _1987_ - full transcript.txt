Kameneva All kinds of bizarre things are there, In this world they come our way, The traces of the past time everywhere, But we are responsible for today. We are to make a house grow In the days to come, remembering the past, Our life is fun and adventure, though, Though it's so tempting, and we just must If only take one single look, One single look at the future age And read, like in a book, What awaits man at that stage. Natasha GUSEVA as Alice Seleznyova Also starring Sasha GUSEV as Gerasik Vyacheslav NEVINNY as Gromozeka Boris SHCHERBAKOV as Seleznyov Vyacheslav BARANOV as Green With Svetlana KHARITONOVA as Baba Yaga Igor YASULOVICH as Kashchei Viktor PAVLOV as Man-eater Sergey NIKONENKO as Horse-eater Vladimir NOSIK as Magician Uuuh Marina LEVTOVA as Frog Princess Moscow time: 7:45. Here is the latest news. Chukotka's farmers have grown a generous harvest of pineapples. The first shipment of the fruit has been sent to kindergartens. Young geologist Kolia Gerasimov discovered on Ganimed a diamond 1 foot 8 inches in diameter. How are we doing? All systems of the ship are functioning normally. - Course? - O.K. - Speed? - O.K. - Fuel consumption? - O.K. - Keep it up! - Yes, Captain. And now weather forecast. No precipitation is expected in Moscow today, moderate south-east wind, the temperature - +18 C. Information for mushroom gatherers. Tomorrow a sun shower is expected, of 22-minute duration. Alice, how soon? Have a little patience. How are we doing? Approaching dead reckoning position. You'll meet your friend, and I'll fly on. We'll expect you back in two months. In 66 days. Yes, in 66 days, 3 hours and 8 minutes. - You're a pedant, Green. - I like precision and order. You had better spent the vacation at the seaside. It would have been good for Alice. She looks pale. But you keep dragging her with you. She was dreaming of this expedition. -A child shouldn't rummage in dust. -I promised her. Everybody please come to the table. Dinner is ready. At last. Alice, you're a genius. I tried my best, it's our farewell dinner. Captain, we're hungry. Please sit down. What? What is this? It's impossible. Don't be scared. She's flying with me. Throw this filth overboard now. It's not filth, it's a frog. And not an ordinary frog, but a bewitched princess. And you wanted to kill her. You wanted to throw her into the black outer space. Excuse us, Your Highness, the captain has awful manners. Alice, why did you bring a frog onto the ship? Daddy, you surprise me. Magician Uuuh from the era of legends gave her to me. It's simple. Seleznyov, doesn't Alice worry you? Some strange fantasies - princesses, magicians. Eat this delicious salad. Alice tried to please you. Bewitched princesses, witches and magicians really could have lived in the era of legends. Nobody saw them. Where have they disappeared then? Don't you know? They became extinct. How do you know about them if they are extinct? From fairy tales. It's simple. Don't be afraid. I put her in a jar. I'm not afraid. Only I've hated since childhood all kinds of worms, frogs and... I'm afraid for you. I think that only love can save her. Sure. But where can we find a worthy prince? Besides, she's so fastidious. It's here again. I can't go on like this. I can't eat a thing. Don't worry, Green. Soon we'll say goodbyes, and you'll again have quiet and your beloved order on the Pegasus. Attention! A spaceship right off our course. There we go. Dad, it is our Gromozeka! The set of coordinates information. Yes, Captain. - Radio contact. - Right, Captain. Gromozeka, this is Pegasus. Seleznyov is on line. Gromozeka, this is Pegasus. Seleznyov is on line. Why don't you copy? This is not Gromozeka. - Some other ship. - What do you mean, other ship? And where's Gromozeka? Will find out. Not listed in the Lloyd-Somov manual. - It's impossible. - I know it's impossible. - Requesting additional information. - Yes, Captain. The size is colossal. I've never seen anything like that. No response. Based on circumstantial data, I come to the conclusion that this is the “Black Wanderer“. Black Wanderer? A space death. I thought it was just myths. Crew, get ready to turn. - We're going back. - Why? We'll call a patrolling cruiser in the zone of planetary communication. We can't fly away, Gromozeka is out there, he doesn't know about it. The engines of the Black Wanderer, both the main and auxiliary ones, are not functioning. The ship's outer lining indicates that it has been in flight for a thousand years. Its external aerials are damaged. Green, let's board it and deliver it to the Earth. Those who are supposed to board it, will do it. By all appearances, the ship is dead and not dangerous. - Our duty is to examine it. - And warn Gromozeka. Green, dear, let's board it, okay? As to your request, I'm informing you. The ship named “Black Wanderer“ is heading towards the Earth. Given its speed, it will reach the Earth in 16 days. Do you hear? It's heading towards the Earth. Green, say something. We'll lose it. Attention, the set of start readiness. Yes, Captain. Maneuvering to approach the “Black Wanderer“. Moving by parallel course. Prepare a module for disembarkation. That's it. Right, Captain. I'll go in a reconnaissance launch. If I'm not back in 30 minutes, or if the connection is cut off, Professor Seleznyov will stand in for me on board. Right, Captain. I order him to go at maximal speed to Pluto. Yes, Captain. And no attempts to save me. Captain, maybe it would be more sensible if I go? I think it would be more sensible not to discuss the commander's orders. Am proceeding along the lining. Found an entrance hatch. The through device is working. Entered a long corridor. You got a good picture? Yes. The life-supporting systems are functioning. Am going on. Gravitation is working. The gravity is almost normal. There're premises on either side of the corridor. So far I won't look into them. Strange. What happened? No, nothing. Though... I think I hear footfalls. Stay cool, Green. Gromozeka. Dad, it's Gromozeka. Don't be scared, Gromozeka. He won't touch you. Alice, my child, where are you? We're here, close by, on the Pegasus. We came to meet you. At first, I took the Black Wanderer for you. I radioed you - no response. I flew up closer - an alien. Weren't you scared to board it? I'm an archeologist, and it speaks volumes. I just began to examine the ship, and suddenly was attacked by that Violet of yours. He's Green. Actually, he's good. He just got scared of you. Scared of me? Can I scare anyone? To be honest, one has to get used to you. This is for you. Thanks. You didn't forget. Oh, time flies so fast, Seleznyov. It seems that only yesterday I was rocking this baby in my hands. Only I don't remember which hands they were. Oh, why didn't you say it in the first place? Captain, please forgive me for occupying your place. Let's drink tea. Pass me a cup. You're not hurt, are you, Gromozeka? But there must be order on the ship, especially on the Pegasus. Yes, Captain Green just loves order. For instance, a bewitched princess is living with me. And Green believes she's just a frog, and he wants to throw her overboard. Unbelievable! He's a monster. Thank you, Alice. Alice, I would be happy to meet the princess. Professor Seleznyov, you wanted to visit the Wanderer. I'm warning you, time is limited. You've got 70 minutes. - Dad, I'm coming with you. - Don't even dream of it. And I think that Alice should visit the Wanderer. She will remember it for the rest of her life. Thanks, Green. You're a real friend. The last resident of that ship died 26,000 years ago. Alice, don't go far. All right. So it looks like they didn't know anything but their ship? They were born, lived and died here. Terrible. Yes, they went to other planets just to rob and kill. Alice! - Alice, where are you? - I'm coming. Alice, how many times do I have to call you? What's this? Throw away this foul thing now! The honorable professor, I'm getting the impression that to some extent, and perhaps in a great degree, you've somehow forgot you had been a child, too. Seleznyov. Seleznyov, immediately return to the Pegasus. Return to the Pegasus immediately. My friends. - Look What I've found. - What is it? This is a recording of the last minutes of life on the Black Wanderer. It's all so strange. And senseless. Yes, it makes very little sense. Then why did it happen? So suddenly... It happened when the slave broke the purple ball. Alice, where's your ball? In the cabin. I'll go and bring it. No. No, I'll do it myself. They were heading for the Earth. Is it accidental or... Of course, it's not accidental. They wanted to conquer us. Don't be silly. Even a hundred Wanderers couldn't have conquered the Earth. It's so difficult with you grownups. Whatever I say, is silly. Do you want some tea? Do you want some tea? Yes, I think so. You know What was in the purple ball? A virus of enmity. If it gets in the human's lungs, the person gets insane and hates absolutely everything. He feels like killing. You don't believe it? Now we know how they were conquering other planets. They sent a reconnaissance ship ahead of them. That ship hid the purple ball somewhere on the planet. The ball exploded right before the landing of the Black Wanderer. Just imagine, people don't suspect anything, they just live and work. And suddenly they begin to hate one another. And they're warring until not a single man left. To think What would have happened if I broke the ball... I would have hated Dad, and Dad would have hated Gromozeka. And Green would have killed you for sure. Alice, are you sleeping? No, I'm thinking. How are you, Your Highness? Gromozeka, I love you because you're so trustful. I told you that the frog was bewitched, and you believed it. Why shouldn't I trust you? Alice. You're grownup now, so you should know everything. Are they hiding something from me again? I found their reconnaissance ship's journal. They were flying to infect with the virus of enmity... The Earth? When were they on our planet? They were there in the era of legends. Well, it's very good. What is so good about it? It means that the ball had rotted long ago, so we have nothing to fear. It didn't rot. It can survive for a million years. And it didn't explode? It will explode at 8:45 on August 16, 2087. Today is the 6th. So we got only 10 days. We have to do something. Did you tell her? I told her everything, my colleague. Green made a decision to deliver the ball to the Earth and find an antidote in case of the explosion. Attention all! The Pegasus takes off for the Earth. Maximal speeding-up. Take-off in 5 minutes. - Alice. - I'm here. Tell me, please, how do the frogs, sorry, I mean the princesses, endure the overloads? Don't worry, she'll be in the aquarium. All take amortization seats. Princess, will you please dive into the water. Earth, requesting immediate landing. Clear the Spaceport, remove all ships, we carry a dangerous load. Earth is copying. Repeat your information. We have a dangerous virus on board. In this case, your landing on Earth denied. Wait for a medical ship and come through quarantine. Excuse me, you misunderstood. It's Professor Seleznyov speaking. It's an emergency. We need to land on Earth. Call the virologists. Professor, I can't put to risk people's health. The Earth may perish in a few days. The purple ball with a virus has been left on Earth. Professor, doesn't it seem strange that you're carrying to Earth the ball, which is already on Earth? The purple ball with the virus of enmity had been left on Earth by the Black Wanderer thousands of years ago. It will explode when the Black Wanderer approaches the Earth. The Black Wanderer? But it's just a legend. When you see that legend, you'll go weak in the knees from fear. No, the Black Wanderer is dead. Doesn't it remind you of the second part of the film “Battle in the Black Galaxy“? I order you to stay in orbit and wait. They think we've gone crazy. Please, we beg you to let us land. We won't go out. We'll remain in the ship until our colleagues arrive. Attention, space patrol. Send a quarantine cruiser in orbit. Detain the Pegasus ship. We suspect mass psychosis. I repeat, space patrol, detain the Pegasus ship. We suspect mass psychosis. We can't stay in orbit and wait for the psychiatrists to examine us. And we won't. Everybody get ready, we begin emergency landing. Professor Seleznyov speaking. I need to make an urgent report to the Academy of Sciences. You will, you will make your urgent report. After you take a rest and have a good sleep. But now everyone remain at your place. We must escape. It's impossible. I know What we should do. You stay here and distract them, and I shall run to the time machine and rush back in time to the era of legends, to the day and hour when the Black Wanderer's recon launch is going to land. There I'll try to find out where they hide the purple ball. It's not a child's business. You'll get lost there in 10-minute's time. That's the era of legends, and you've never been there. And I have some acquaintances there. The child speaks sense. Only one correction. I'm going with Alice to the era of legends. All right. I'm used to trusting you about everything, Alice. You'll go back in time with Gromozeka. Without him, this journey would be too dangerous. And don't leave his side for a second. Green, I'm leaving my princess with you. Take good care of her. What princess? Have you really been here before? Where else could I get the Frog Princess? You still doubt it, don't you? Sorry, Alice. From this minute, I doubt no more. I'm fully at your service. But where shall we go? Just follow me. Come on, don't be afraid. Dragon! Dragon, dear! Hi! Have you seen Magician Uuuh? You see, I need him very much. What a magnificent species! Excellent! If you see Uuuh, tell him we're looking for him. And what's this lump? Don't be surprised, it's a regular magic stone. Magic? You go straight - you lose your life. We can't go there, the Earth's fate depends on us. You go left - you lose the good. We can't lose the good. Right, or we'll become evil and cruel. You go right - you lose the horse. Exactly. We got no horse, so we have nothing to lose. So, it's decided, we go right. Well, let it be right. May we come in? Come in, as long as you're here. Come in, come in, come in, come in, come in. Well, have you come in? What's your business, dear guests? Dear guests, dear guests, dear guests. Hello. My name is Alice. I'm Kashchei. I'm Horse-eater. This... Me... this... Me... this me... This is me. Man-eater. Right. And this is my friend, archeologist Gromozeka. Can you help us? It's an urgent matter. There're no urgent matters. - No urgent, no urgent. - No. By What road did you come here? You see... There were no roads whatsoever. It's carved in black and white there. We took right. So it's to me. And where's the horse? We got no horse. Why did you take my road if you got no horse? If there's no horse, give the good. It's not fair, they give away the good on the left road. So there are roads. And you said there were no roads. Excuse me, dear, but it's just demagoguery. Don't swear. All right, then. No horse, no good. Then you can be just eaten. Come on, Man-eater. They're mine, mine. Mine, my dears, good. Mine, mine. Let go. Not mine. Let go. Not mine, not mine. Not mine. Oh, not mine, not mine. Not mine, not mine. This is a complicated case. It can't be solved without the granny. Excuse me, What granny? What do you mean, What granny? The one that flies. A smart granny. Yes, our granny. And how can we find her? You go straight. Go on, and on, and on, and you'll find her. Alice, Who's that granny? Granny! It's Baba Yaga. Baba-Yaga. A witch and a villain. Every child here knows her. Her hut is over there. Little hut, little hut, turn your face to me and your back to the trees. Why? What's that noise? The hut is old. It'll drop off its feet turning for everybody. But that's how it's supposed to be. So What? Lots of things are supposed to be. Granny. You turn, you whirl, you interfere with my work. Granny. Granny has to do everything. Tit, go and do threshing. My belly is aching. Tit, come and eat. Where's my big spoon? By the hill, on a hillock, Standing are thirty-three... What dear guests! What dear guests! Hello. Granny. Hello, if it's no joke. Excuse us, but we need your help. You fly a lot, you see and know a lot. Have you seen an air ship descending on Earth? You mean a magic carpet? No, it rather looks like a huge egg, taller than the trees. It boils in the cauldron, but not put on the table right away. I've seen the egg! The needle is small, but it makes a hole. It does, it does. Let us speak to the boy. Where have you seen a boy? - I mean this one. - Gerasik? He's not a boy, he's an enemy, the offender of everything living. Man-eater, dear, tell them What he did to you... What is there to tell... He forged a girl from iron, a little, pretty, delicious girl, right? I forged her myself! Clad her in a dress and put her to his side. He began to eat the girl and, look, broke his teeth on her. He gives no peace either to people or to the cattle. He just eats. - Granny, hurry, he bites. - Bear it, dear Horse-eater. I hate smart alecks. It makes no difference - smart or stupid. What's important, everyone should know his place. A magician should do Witchcraft, a dragon should blow smoke, a man-eater should eat people. And those humans should not interfere with it. Or there will be no order. So you can insult us, gobble us, kill us, and we must keep silent? Himself teeny-weeny, but talks like a genie. You see? If every human chick!.. Today - Man-eater's teeth, tomorrow - the dragon's head, and the day after tomorrow he'll raise a hand at her herself. The granny. What nonsense are you babbling? Keep your trap shut! I'll get down to you, too, Baba Yaga. Running before a horse. You see? - And we're no enemies of humans. - No, not enemies. And no enemies of you personally, Gerasik. We even like something about you. But you're transgressing. Well, has he been condemned? - Condemned! - Been long without meat, damn it! Condemned! Condemned! Condemned! Condemned! Condemned! Condemned! Excuse me... Excuse me... What are you going to do with the boy? Boil him. Can't eat him raw. - We won't let you do it. - What? Put the child down on the planet. I repeat. Put the child down on the planet. Put me down. That was a sensible thing to do. I liked you at first sight. Gromozeka is a giant! Alice, run! And you? Did you forget why we're here? Run and look for the ship! Go! Go! Don't be shy, friends. Don't be shy. We got a lot to talk about. I have an impression I haven't made myself clear yet. Go in to the assault, you fools! Gromozeka is a giant! Alice, that monster with you, is he a human, too? What monster? He's my friend, archeologist Gromozeka. He's a human, but from another planet. - From where? - Well, from a star, from the sky. So the sky isn't solid, after all. Listen, Alice, is the earth turning or not? It's turning. I told them so! I'm awfully smart. Listen to What I thought of when they were judging me. Why do we drag everything? What if we take round blocks, fix a stick between them, and put a board on top? And let it roll by itself. What do you think? Will it work? Of course it will. It's called “the wheel“. - Gerasik, how long do we have to go? - We'll be there soon. Careful on the rocks. You might break your legs here. That's them. Hide. - Why? - They may see us. Who? The aliens who flew in on that ship. It's not a ship, it's an egg. Gerasik, you don't know everything yet. You think that eggs can be this big? They're as big as they're laid. I have no time to argue with you. Now we must find out if they've come out or not yet. How can they come out if the egg is Whole? As soon as the chick hatches, then beware. Do you hear him pecking? That's their engine. No. Now he'll gather strength and get out. We must wait. What if they're getting ready to fly off? No, eggs don't fly. - Listen to the idea I got. - Hush. He can't hear. I'll blow up a bubble full of smoke, tie a basket to it, sit in the basket and fly. Isn't it a good idea? What's this? It's the Rok bird's chick. Were you expecting a hen's chick? What size will he be when he grows up? Oh, you're so ignorant there, in the future. - Let's run now. - He's so funny. When he peck you up, it'll be no fun. Alice, tell me, why do apples fall from the tress? Birds fly, but apples fall on the ground. Quiet, that's them. I don't understand why she threw eggs about. - Who? - The Rok bird. Gerasik, it's not an egg, it's a spaceship. Last time you also said it was a ship, but it was an egg. You're so obstinate. We'll see Who's more obstinate. I say, an egg. You say, not an egg. A chick has already hatched, but you keep saying, not an egg. Now you see? They will make a reconnaissance and leave a purple ball on the Earth. It's important for us to see where they're going to hide it. When they fly away, we must take that ball. Where're you going? They'll kill you. It seems they're about to fly away. What shall we do? - Be quiet. - It's not me. Who, then? It's not nice forgetting old friends. - Uuuh, it's you! -Alice. I'm so happy to see you. The dragon brought me on his tail the news that you're here, and I immediately went looking for you. I have a very important thing to tell you. I forgot. They're going to leave. Alice, look! I'm sorry, Uuuh, but it's necessary. Wow! Oh, what's going to happen? I Wish I knew in What direction we're flying and at What speed. Why haven't they left the ball there? I guess the magician scared them off. Strange, we seem to be descending. Yes, that must be the end of me. Alice! Alice, where are you? Alice! Uuuh, come here. Alice! I'm here. There she is. - Alice, are you cold? - A little bit. - You got scared? - Yes, that you'll never find me. Seven miles for a friend is no big distance. They've hidden the ball here. Yeah, it's not easy to lift it. We have to invent something. Why invent? Isn't it something! Gerasik, you're distracting me. - Take it, Gerasik, hurry. - You won't smash me? You talk too much. Take it, quick. Well, Gerasik, how is it? I saw you putting on the cap of darkness and getting on the ship. Well, I thought, Alice is something! How is our Gromozeka doing there? Alice! We found the ball. You're a heroic girl. No, dear Gromozeka, we all together found it. Please meet Uuuh, the magician I told you about. Nice meeting you. I'm flattered. Glad to meet you. Always at your service, the wisest Gromozeka. And now let's go to my place. You'll see my palace, I'll treat you to sherbet and ambrosia. Dear Uuuh, we must hurry, they wait and worry about us. It's heavy. Alice. Maybe we'll take him with us? Thanks, I'd love to, but I have a lot to do here. Get on, Gerasik, I'll give you a lift to the village. Let's go. Anyway, it's boring there, in your future. Everything's been invented. Gerasik. Uuuh! Do you remember now What you meant to tell me? Was I supposed to?.. I forgot. Alice, we're home. - Have you found it? - Yes. I must tell you, esteemed professor, that if it were not for Alice with her, I should say... We must immediately put the ball in an insulated box. Yes, I'm at your service, my colleague. Alice, I remember What I wanted to tell you. Sorry, Uuuh, we're in a hurry, the ball may explode any minute. What ball? This one? You can throw it away. - Throw where? - In the sea. Highly esteemed magician Uuuh, excuse us, but it's no time for joking. Uuuh isn't joking. If you can't throw it in the sea, throw it onto the Moon. But there're people there, on expeditions. Then Uuuh will throw it on the Sun. Uuuh is not joking. Uuuh is not joking at all. Alice, I wanted to tell you this. Only love can save the princess. Alyosha. Alice. Alice. Goodbye, Alice. The End
