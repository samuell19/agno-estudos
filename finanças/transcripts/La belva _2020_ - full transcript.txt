Captain Riva. Welcome back. So, how are you? You have to increase my dosage. - Captain Riva... - Leonida. Leonida. I can go on dosing you up with drugs until you forget your own name. Or we can try to come up with something else. Otherwise, it will be impossible for me to help you. If you want to help me, increase the dosage. They invited me to Saturday’s match. - Is your son playing? - No... Teresa, the little one. The kids will come over for dinner afterwards, so... I don't want to... I want to stay calm while I am with them. There's a support group tomorrow at 11:00. Talking to someone can help you. You could try at least... Maybe on Saturday, with your wife... Do I tell her about 30 years of military missions, at the match? Not more than one every eight hours. And come back next week, so we will understand if we need to make adjustments. THE BEAST Easy! Go! Watch out! Ref! That's a high tackle! Teresa is getting good. I didn't know you train her. When do you play? Look, I'm not six years old. Can you please let me through? Thank you. - Do you need a fork? - Yes, please. How are you? How about you? I'm fine. About tonight, do we stick to our plan? - If you don't feel like it... - No, it's ok. Fine. The only thing is that Terry doesn't eat cheese. It's been a month. I don't know why. It was her choice. All of a sudden. Have you seen Mattia? Yes, I... I met him before. Ok. Ok, see you later. - Mom. - Honey. Where's my pink sweater? - Did you check the clothes rack? - Right. Thank you, dear. What's the matter? Are you sure it's just a business dinner? Wait. Get him something. A dessert. - It means a lot to your sister. - I know. - Come on! - I'm going. - Why are we stopping here? - Get off. - Aren't we going to dad's? - Get off, Terry. Come on! How about a nice burger? Come on! - Thank you. - Here you go. It's eleven twenty. There you go. - I'll get your change. - Thank you. Cool. Come on, dig in. You are always eating! We are a little late. - Hi, little girl. - Hello, kitty! Hi! Bye, sweetie. - Terry, I'll be back in five minutes. - Where are you guys going? Just back there, wait here. The coach says he won't cap me anymore, if I don't go back to two training sessions a week. He's right. Serves you right. - My father doesn't let me out... - Right, your father... - You mean Miss Marini... - Ouch! She keeps you on a leash, like a puppy. At least I get laid. At what cost? - Teddy bear! - Shut up. Stop screaming. Shut up. You have to come back. Scrums with Montedoro suck. - Yes sir, my captain. - Good boy. You could always leave Miss Marini to Teddy Bear 2 and me! Shut your mouth. How bad do you wanna bang her? She is big-boned. We'll take turns fucking her. Terry? - What happened ? - I saw a Jeep rushing away. Excuse me? Have you seen a little girl, red hair? I came out as I heard her screaming. Terry? Terry? Teresa? Teresa? Terry? Terry! I don't know, I just saw a Jeep... Mattia, go talk to the waitress. Mattia, where are you? Dad, I don't know what happened... Calm down, please... Mattia, I don't understand. I swear, she just disappeared. Are you sure? Yes, I think so. Where are you? At the fast food right behind mom's house. How long it has been? I don't know, dad, ten minutes I think. Are you alone? Call the police. And don't move. I'm on my way. We don't have the plate of the suspect vehicle, only a description provided by a witness. It's dark-colored, maybe dark green. We are placing roadblocks around the area. Get a couple of officers, take a look around. Try to figure out if anybody has seen or heard something. Mister Riva? Deputy Chief Basilio Simonetti. We alerted every police station, the forensic team is coming... Did you manage to reach her mother? Not yet. I understand. Excuse me for a moment. Patrol car S38 speaking. We noticed a suspect vehicle, a Jeep. It’s running fast on viale San Giorgio towards the shopping center. - Pull it over. - Copy that. It's not stopping. Suspect vehicle on the run! We need backup, the Jeep is too fast! Turn there! Fuck... The Jeep has just turned. Alert the flying squad. - Escort everyone to the police station. - Yes. You two, come with me. What the fuck is he doing? Sir, they're headed out of town, we can't keep up with them. Mister Riva, stop! I'm fine. For Christ's sake... Turning to Via di Secondo Beneventano. We're getting closer. Proceeding on Viale delle Muse. Watch out! Pick up... Pick up! Fuck you! They have just reported to us the disappearance of a six year old girl in the premises of a fast food restaurant, north of town. The police hasn't released any official statement yet but according to some rumors it could be a kidnapping. Several witnesses on the crime scene claim they saw a suspect vehicle running away... What do we have? Within 50 kilometers, we have 21 suspects with criminal records... 21? What about the Jeep? The license plate is stolen... - Traffic cameras? - Traffic cameras? - Nothing yet. - Good Lord! First Captain Leonida Riva. 30 years in the Special Forces. 12 missions in high-risk areas... Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, collaborations with Americans in Afghanistan... and then a mission that started badly and ended up worse. "Three years after discharge, the patient is still highly unstable, "tends towards isolation, "shows high levels of social, psychological and physical disability." He refused treatment, so they started dosing him up with drugs. What if he has something to do with the kidnapping? He must have made a few enemies in the past. His wife just came in. Maybe we can convince her to get in touch with him... Riva is not coming back. He knows he has lost any chance of a friendly dialogue with us. The investigation is too delicate, he will screw everything up. We have to stop this man. Come here. This is a self-service, handsome. - Look, do you sell... - What do you need? I need a lot of this stuff. You want to go wild! Ok. Wait here. - You're right, he does look like a cop. - I told you! Guys, I just need information. Go away. You'd better not. Tell me who deals it. I don't know. Please, I don't want to die. You're gonna beg me to kill you. The Mastiffs! It's their stuff. Tell where I can find them. What the fuck are you doing? What? What do you mean, someone followed you? What did you do? Yes. I'll meet you there, yes. Yes. I'm going to help you with the Jeep. Mom... May I speak with you for a second? Any news from Mr. Riva? Can you think of someone who might have been targeting you? Maybe a former colleague of your husband, a superior... No... Alright. We'll call you as soon as we have news. For anything, this is my personal number. Open it up... Holy shit! Come here. I thought you were gonna run away with one of his sluts... What the fuck are you saying? - Do you have some stuff? - Yes. Here. Come on. How much is this? Did you count it? No, we gotta get rid of the car. Where is my daughter? - Who do you work for? - Nobody, we work for nobody. Where is she? Who did you sell her to? Who did you sell her to? Shit. Stop. Shit. Go. The disappearance of little Teresa Riva is officially a kidnapping. Public Prosecutor's office has promptly opened a case and locked the city down. These are hours of fear, crucial for the life of the disappeared child. According to the investigators, a kidnapping without a ransom note would mean that the police has very little time to find the girl... Sir... Is there anything I can do? I don't know. Take a seat. I know it's not easy. And it's no use to tell you to be calm. But we're doing everything we can to find your sister. But you can stay close to your mother. Stick together. Mattia? I have to ask you to leave the office. - So? - We managed to catch the Jeep. It changed several license plates in the past four months, but there is a pattern. It went through this road regularly this week. What do we have in the area? There is a shipyard. There is more. Just before the Jeep came through here tonight. Take a look. It's Riva's car. I knew it. - Do you think that he... - I think that he... I think that he is a former soldier on medication, who ran from a crime scene and made us lose the track of who was likely to be our kidnapper. And now he appears again around the only suspect area we were able to identify. And what do we do? Do we believe in coincidence, now? What the fuck! My house is under surveillance. I'm sorry. There are more bandages in there. I'll get them. The number you dialed... If you know something, you must tell the police. Let's go to the police station. Let's go together. Mattia is there. He needs you. - If you go it alone, you'll die. - At least our daughter will be safe. Lights are on. That's strange. What's wrong? Maybe Riva has nothing to do with it. Maybe we're just following the same lead, and he is ahead of us. Are we doing the "pissed-off boss" routine? Come on, let's go. Is anybody there? Is there anyone? What do you need? Hello. I know it's late, but... our car broke down over there. Please! Can you lend us some cables? We have been traveling since this morning... My boss is a little nervous. Nervous? He looks like an asshole to me. Wait here. - So, where's the car? - At the gate. Your colleague kindly offered himself to... Ok, but you can't be here. Come on. Let's go to that gate and fix your car. May I ask you a question? Here... do you work with open flames? - Who the fuck are you? - Police, drop your weapons. - Drop that gun. - Yes. Tell your friend not to fuck around or I'll blow his head off. Ok, easy, easy... You'd better not. I'm going to put my gun down now. Listen... There is a sniper squad ready to fire, if anything goes wrong. Easy. Keep calm. It's gonna be alright. What do you want? We are looking for the owner of an old Jeep. No. Fuck. Hey! We found a burned body. 30-year-old male. They must have gotten rid of him an hour ago, tops. What about the Jeep? They found it. At the scrap yard. Look, there is something more. We found this, near the body. We have to examine it, but... it's a baby tooth. After the kidnapping, he called the girl and a different number three times. Can we trace it? What do you know about these people? They were talking about a man and his prostitutes. Keep him on the line for at least 20-30 seconds. Hello? - Hi, they gave me your number. - Who's there? I need... some girls. - About ten, for a party. - Do you know what time it is? My boss is very demanding. For when? Tomorrow. Quiet! Fucking dog. - Now I'm busy. - Wait. Northbound road, past viale Maria Valerio. Look. You have an overall radius of two hundred meters. It will be hard to find him. It will have to do. Leonida Riva, nobody's son. "The beast". No way you changed, fuck. Neither did you. Hey. I've lost four pounds. I know how you feel. You can't wait to jump into the void, to go back on a mission... It's the only thing we know how to do, right? Where did it happen? There was this moment, after the blast... They were taking me away in a helicopter. I was messed up, so high on morphine. But I definitely remember one thing. I was bleeding to death and thinking: "Fuck, if I can't walk anymore, I can't fight anymore". Going back to a normal life looked like a nightmare to me. But then... I realized I was neither the first nor the last one feeling that way. That I could survive, because someone, before me, did make it. Knowing this was enough for me. Take care, Leo. Captain. We're bringing you back home now. There are more! Easy, easy! Go, go, go. - Go, go! - For Christ's sake. Downstairs! Move, move! Go! My wife would have complained. But I never complain, you know... Mozart, please... I have nothing to do with it, I swear. Please... Your boss told me something different. - I didn't want to... - Neither do I. If it were not for you and your Prince Charming. The cops are breathing down our necks. I've made an ass of myself with a client, a big one. To make matters worse, we are stuck with that girl who's worth shit now. How is that possible? We took her that age on purpose. So you do have something to do with it? I mean, we took her that age because you told us that... you can place girls that age in a second. - Exactly. - That's why we did it. It's all my fault. Get rid of her first thing in the morning. We've made enough of a mess tonight. What about the girl? The deal is off. Everybody is looking for her, we couldn't leave her there. Make her disappear too. What's up? Oh you poor things, you're breaking my heart... I'll deal with that. Go get her. Hurry up! Hello? Ivan, hi! Did you see the picture? Only the best for my friends. That's the price, I'm sorry. Tomorrow is fine. Dasvidania. What's happening? It happens that the world is a wonderful place. Full of fucking perverts. That is? That is, take the girl and bring her back there. Come on. What is happening? We are bringing you back. What now? I need to go to the toilet. Hurry, or the boss's gonna be mad. Open up! Open the fuck up! Dad! Who the fuck are you? Dad! Upstairs! They kept me in a dark room, isolated. They wanted intelligence. Then the rescue team came to save me. They killed them pretty fast. I tried to take one out. They cut his throat. Captain Riva, your conduct during the imprisonment was exemplary. The Secret Services followed the ops closely and were impressed by your skills. They could use someone like you. They want to bury me under State secrets, don't they, General? It's a promotion, Riva. Speak your mind, Captain. I feel you want to make your point, please. Yes. The rescue mission was too dangerous. You know better than me you should have left me there, General. Or, if you didn't trust me you should have bombed the whole area. instead of sending an entire squad to their death. In front of my eyes. Think of what the Services are offering. It's an opportunity, think it over. I don't need to think it over, General. I request discharge and immediate return. Keep your eyes open, sir. Go! Would you like some? Thank you. They said they won't let us in until the deputy chief arrives. You know... When I met your father... he was finishing the training course. He pretended to speak Arabic. He made me laugh. Then he stopped. When he came back home after his discharge... he had become bitter. Distracted. A stranger. And you kicked him out. He is the one who left. I wanted him to stay, I wanted to deal with it together, as a family. But it was like your father was afraid to get some help. He wanted to protect us, by keeping us away. I hated him. Even if... I've never stopped loving him. Sorry... Mrs. Riva... - May I? - No. I need to see if he's ok. Please. Thank you. Where is your mother? She is smoking downstairs. Police have found some remains of a body. They are trying to understand if... It's not Teresa. I saw her. She's fine. Come here. I need your help. Ok... Check my medical records. See if there is a paper clip. Stay out of sight. - It's there. - Good. Good. Now open it. Hand it to me. Stay there. Stay there. Come on. Good. Now... Now it may happen that the guard gets suspicious and comes in. Ok. If that happens, I need you to run and close the door. Then you stay there and don't move, no matter what happens next. Ok. - Understood? - Yes. Now. Open this fucking door! Open! Easy, easy. Easy... Shit. Wait. Stay there. Move back. Now take the radio and call the station. You have to run a check on a previous offender. His nickname is Mozart. I want to know where I can find him. Station, this is officer Petrassi speaking. I need to run a check. Name and surname, please. I only have a nickname, Mozart. Just a second. I only have one match. Gianrico Sala, 50 years old... He did his time twice. The system reports a building downtown in his name, several apartments out of town, and a restaurant, "The Black Pearl", all legit. There is also a wellness centre that went bankrupt a couple of years ago, on the last floor of Skytower, its name is "Two of hearts". Dad! Petrassi, the deputy chief is here, do I let him come upstairs? Give me the radio. Fast. Petrassi, do you copy? Get down. - Petrassi, what's happening? - Handcuff yourself. Riva! Dad. Please, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Freeze! Drop the guns. Drop the guns! The first results have arrived, it's not her. The remains belong to somebody who died six months ago. Riva is on the run. Stay here. Oh my goodness, help! Get out! Riva! Riva! Fuck. Call the police. Tell them where they can catch up with me. On Sunday we have the qualifying match for the first division. Try to get back. Ivan! Privet! Would you like something to drink? You'll see, you're going to like her. Considering how much it costs... Money is hell. What's wrong? You bastard! I kill you! I kill you! Now, you die. Dad. You found me. It's ok, now. Where is mom? We’re going back home, now. We'll find her. No. Please... I'm sorry. Let us go. I'm begging you... Be careful, it's hot. - Wait a moment. - Where are you going? I'll be right back. Thank you. We found a body, at the shipyard... DNA tests confirmed... it’s a little girl who disappeared in the North, a few months ago. We found... at least two related cases. And we're gonna find more. Now that we have a lead between Mozart and the Mastiffs. Riva... You did a good job. I’d like to bring her back to her mother first. - How’s your tea? - It's hot. A MONTH LATER I'd like to thank you all. Seeing your long faces, I realize that it could have been worse. Much worse. Does anybody want to say something? He never speaks. That's true! You are half off your nut, aren't you? Everybody says you are happy, you think you are in a hotel. Fuck, I'd like to be in a hotel too. What was your job? I was... I worked in the army. Did you fight in a war? More than one. THE BEAST
