[Dr. Connors] Is everything set up? - Yeah. - Okay. [Dr. Connors] Can you tell me your name and what you do, please? My name is Mia Patterson and I'm a social worker. [Dr. Connors] What type of work is that, exactly? I help expectant mothers place their children with foster parents. [Dr. Connors] That seems rewarding. It can be. [Dr. Connors] What brought you to this point, Mrs. Patterson? (ominous music) Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Patterson. No, I wasn't aware of that. My husband was gonna pay it. No, it's not a problem. Just give me a second. Sorry about that. Yes, are you ready? (ominous music) Hey, babe. I got a call from the credit card company today saying that it hasn't been paid in about two months and that it's maxed it. Damn, I'm sorry, baby. I had to use to catch my flight back. It was an emergency I aint even think to check the balance. Flight back? I thought the company paid for stuff like that? We lost the account. The Esquire account? I'm so sorry. Yeah. Al the corporate cards are frozen. You know me being the vice president of marketing, I'm gonna get hit first. Probably gonna have to lay some guys off. Like who? Todd and Jamel for starters. Didn't Todd just get married? Yeah but I'm up against it with this. I mean, I got till the morning to figure this out before they start making cuts. What can I do? Nothing just take care of the credit card for me. That would be great. Just take it from savings. Yeah, I took care of it. Thanks, babe. Sorry, I just, I've been swamped and I haven't been getting any sleep. I'm gonna get out of your hair and go get started on dinner. Okay. Ethan called. Did he? He said he hadn't heard from you in awhile and wanted to know when your flight got in. Jackass. He's worried about you. Is he? Well, he is your brother. Yeah, I mean, I'll get up with him when I got some time. [Mia] There's some paperwork in there that still needs your signature. I think it came in from the lawyer but I think you should still look at them. Yeah, I know. I know, I'll get around to it. Okay. I'll get you some wine. Bourbon please, babe. [Mia] Okay. I'm more old fashioned, I guess, when it comes to relationships. I believe there's a reasonable solution for everything. [Dr. Connors] Explain. Well, what's the biggest issue in any relationship? [Dr. Connors] I'm listening. Communication. See, we're all flawed when it comes to expressing what we feel in a way that our significant other will understand. [Dr. Connors] Does the fault land with the person receiving or giving the information? Well, that's the million dollar question, doc. We're paying a lot of money to find out. (upbeat hip hop) (moaning) (low ominous music) (eerie ethereal music) (light ethereal music) I, um. I have a hard time sleeping. (ominous music) [Dr. Connors] Why? I don't know what's wrong with me sometimes. I just have a hard time remembering if I slept or not. [Dr. Connors] Is that what the medication is for? Good morning. Morning. Let's see. Thank you. D.C. today? Look at you. It's my job to know your itinerary, plan ahead, make sure you're good. Well, I wish you could take this flight and go take care of this for me. I'm sure you'll do great. Yeah, I hope so. Well, you seem good. Of course. I'm always good. Okay. I guess I'll call you when I land. Sure. How 'bout when I get back maybe we start planning to go somewhere special. Special? Like that place you're always telling me about. My island. [Jacob] Yeah. Have a safe flight. [Dr. Connors] Are you still attracted to your husband? What do you mean? Like physically? [Dr. Connors] Yes. God, yes. He's beautiful to me. [Dr. Connors] To you? Yeah. I mean. He's everything I could ask for. I'm lucky to have him.

Stop what? You're his brother and I'm his wife. [Ethan] Are you happy? Yes. Are you happy. Yes, Ethan. I'm just trying to figure somethings out within myself. Through me? I got you. Use me as much as you like. I'll relish it. It was good seeing you. Yeah. Where is he, anyway? [Mia] D.C. D.C.? Well, it was good seeing you.

Oh, small world. Are you out here for the conference, too? Partly but mostly to see clients. Oh, exciting. Yes. Extremely boring stuff. I don't think I even made it through the first hour. I made it two. There was a point where I actually fell asleep a couple times. (laughing) Married, huh? Yeah. For how long? Four years. Wow. That's really sweet. It's something. And you? Oh me. No. Almost tried it once. I was engaged. It just didn't seem like the right time and honestly, I don't think I was quite ready. There's nothing wrong with that. Can we actually have two more? Um. Hey, it's happy hour somewhere, right? [Dr. Connors] When you see your wife how does she make you feel? She's... She's peaceful. [Dr. Connors] And what does peaceful mean? When life is presenting certain obstacles, she's always there. She finds a way to make me realize things aren't so bad. [Dr. Connors] She brings balance to your life? Yeah. Yes, she does.

Don't hurt yourself, old man. What's up? You tell me. Trying to catch up with you. Yeah, you know, in and out of town for the most part. Well how's the corporate world treating you? You know, same old. Trying to stay afloat. And you, Dr. Patterson? You know I never thought I'd complain about this but looking at vaginas all day is draining. I'm serious man, and I'm talking all kinds. It's not exactly super models that's walking up in there daily. And since when does that matter to you? Man, don't get me wrong. I love women but my goodness. Speaking strictly professional, man, some of them women need themselves together. You crazy, bruh. So what bring you out this way? I figured I'd come and check on my brother. You know, maybe catch up and get a few drinks, chop it up a little bit. Nah, man, you know wife will be home in a little bit. I need to run out and grab her prescription before she get in. Family man, huh? Well I guess you got to take care of home first, right? That's what they say, huh? I guess. Well, you know me. I wouldn't know. Right. Well, I'll get with you. All right, man. Oh. What's up? Damn, uh. I got a call about lot four. Four? Smyrna? No, Marietta. I'm going up there tomorrow to make sure they put that new flooring in. I can by there if you need me to. Nah, nah. I'll do it. I just came to let you know. Once it's finished we can get some renters up there. Yeah man, I hear that. All right. All right. Oh that's D right there. Tell him I said what's up. All right. What up, D? [Dr. Connors] Tell me about your family. My family? [Dr. Connors] Yes. Okay. My father died when I was 12 and my mother when I was 16. I got two younger brothers and that's it. [Dr. Connors] Tell me about your brothers. There's not much to tell. Ethan is a gynecologist. - Really? - Yeah, don't ask. And my youngest brother, Devin, he's an engineer. [Dr. Connors] A successful trio of brothers. Yeah. We made it. [Dr. Connors] Thanks to you. You made sure everyone succeeded. I don't know about all of that. I never asked to be head of estate and our affairs. Can be a bit much. [Dr. Connors] The financial responsibilities? Yeah. [Dr. Connors] You are in a position that most people would envy. If you can get that form over to me as soon as possible, I can get that form started. Thank you, Ms. Willis. Have a great day. I keep telling her over and over again. Third time today and she keeps calling over and over. Guess she got tired of hearing about it from me. Yeah, well if I was pregnant at 16 I'd be nervous, too. Stop it. Hey, so. So? Ethan, silly. That. Yeah, did you talk to him for me? I think he's seeing someone. Think or you know? Well, come on, Mia. I mean your husband's brother is fine and I'm single, looking to mingle You need to calm down. Well ever since the divorce I've been really looking forward to getting back on that horse, if you know what I'm saying. Goodness. You're doing too much. You act like you're keeping him all to yourself or something. What? (laughing) Oh I'm just playing, girl but if you could look into that for me, I'd really appreciate it. Hell, I'll even take the youngest brother. I won't discriminate. Okay. I'll check into it again. Thank you. Regarding your personal finances, you've taken a few hits in the past few months. Your investments have not panned out. Yeah, the company is taking substantial financial hits recently. I kind of saw it coming and I've been trying to establish myself outside of Mason and Associates. Branching out? Yes, sir. Investments and such. I see. The money just isn't there, Jacob. Now, I can move some assets from your family's affairs, temporarily, to put you in a more viable position. No. Jacob, I've watched you and your brothers take what your family left and grow it into generational wealth. I've been thoroughly impressed with that growth. Which brings me to my next question. From a personal standpoint, your money has been erratic for the last year or so. Is there something you want to tell me, son? I don't know, Mr. Watkins. I don't even know. I mean I've made some moves. I didn't think it was this bad. Think I just need to slow down. Well, I can restructure some things, put you on a more restrictive budget until we get a grasp on it. That is if you don't want to go with option A. No. I don't want to touch the family's assets if I don't have to. I understand. Good. And can we keep this between the two of us? I don't want to worry my brothers. Absolutely. Sex is something I've always needed to a certain degree. [Dr. Connors] Why? Is it purely for the physical stimulation? No. I like being needed. Wanted. [Dr. Connors] By your husband? Of course. [Dr. Connors] You don't ever feel the desire to be needed or wanted by other men? Why would I? (sobbing) (screaming) (phone buzzing) Hey, honey. Yeah, I'm fine. Getting ready to head home. How are you? (soft tense music) (phone chimes) (phone chimes) (soft tense music) (eerie music) [Jacob] You know you can't sneak up on a black man like that. Almost knocked your ass out. You look like you saw a ghost. Yeah. So, how was your day? Long. Well, I'm gonna go take a shower. You should join me. I will. Good.

You right. What's up with him, anyways? Man, you know, I really don't know. Maybe he's traveling or handling some business, I guess, I don't know. Did you tell him about the Marietta property? Yeah, I did. You know J's cool with whatever it is we decide as long as it's nothing crazy. I mean I handle all the property stuff anyway and he handles the investment stuff, so. What about me?

Although he is really good in the bedroom. Then what's wrong with him being passive? I feel like I'm supposed to be teaching him things that he should already know.

That's it? What you want me to say? I don't know, congrats, I'm proud of you, little brother. Something a loving family member would say. I'm happy for you. Now you know that was fake as hell. Look man, is five months really enough? I mean is a year, two, three? I mean, shoot, look at you and Mia. That's not what I meant, bro. Look, all I'm saying is for me, yeah, five months is enough. Okay. Well, I am happy for you. Congratulations. (soft tense music) Hey. Hey. I'm glad you could make it on such short notice. It's fine. I was free today. Good. Well, have a seat. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. So I told myself I wasn't gonna beat around the bush when I told you this and then I wasn't gonna get all dramatic once I told you. What is it? I'm seeing someone. Oh. Is that all you have to say? Why are you telling me this? The reason I'm telling you is twofold. Okay. One and probably the most obvious reason, is that whatever is this we are doing it can't continue and the other I think we should tell Jacob about us. Excuse me? Just hear me out. Have you lost your damn mind? You had no problem sleeping with me when you didn't have anyone now all of a sudden you do you want to blow my life up? That's not what I'm trying to do. Then what are you doing, Ethan? Please keep your voice down. How dare you? I'm just trying to build something with my brother, that's all. And telling him that you've been sleeping with his wife is gonna do that? No by telling him about us before he met you. You're a piece of work. Don't be like that. Go to hell. Brother or not, if I see you around me or my husband again, I'll kill you. (soft tense music) Mia. (tense electronic music) Yes, sir. Okay, thank you for your business. (knocking) Come in. Sir. Jacob. I have someone that I want you to meet. She's new to the firm. Okay. Mr. Patterson. I've heard so many good things about you. All good things, I hope. Of course. Ms. Cooper here seems to be a big fan of yours. She has done a lot of research on you, Jacob and the company of course. So, in fact, I figured that a partnership between the two of you would be most beneficial. Partnership? Yes. Ms. Cooper here has experience with Esquire Incorporated. So, of course, once they got wind that we were bringing her on, they decided to renegotiate our contracts with them. Of course. As Mr. Reed stated, I'm here to help in anyway that I can. I see. (laughing) Fantastic. All right well, I will leave you two to it. Make me some money. Thank you, sir. What the hell are you doing? Helping. You're crazy. Yeah but you love it. We're not doing this. Why? Why? Because I'm married. Yeah but are you? Stop. Do you really... Stop. Your wife is pretty. She likes to work out on Tuesdays, go for a run with her friend on Thursdays then a matinee on Friday, picking up prescriptions, dog food, and then coffee at eight a.m. every morning. She is particular. Predictable yet strangely alluring. I wonder if she would like me? What do you want? You. (ominous music) [Dr. Connors] You seem a bit distracted today. Is everything all right? What would you like me to focus on, Dr. Connors? - [Dr. Connors] The time is yours. I'm here for you, you know? Are you? What have you done, Dr. Connors? What have you done for me and my husband? You sit there and you ask all these questions and you feed us delusions of grandeur, what are you expecting to get from these sessions, Dr. Connors? [Dr. Connors] That's completely up to you, Mia. My purpose is to ask the hard questions and to get you to think outside your box. What you get out of these sessions is entirely up to you. (eerie tense music) It's been a long ass day. Yeah, you're wearing it. You look tired, bro. Yeah. But look, um. You think you gonna make it out to the dinner? I don't know, depending on what time it is I might be able to get out there for a little bit. You know I got a lot going on right now, man. Okay. Well I mean, just let me know. We'll work it out. Aight. E, what's up? We have a problem. Problem? What's wrong? I just left the property up in Jonesboro, lot eight, and it's been sold. My key doesn't even work. So did you flip it or something without telling us? Sold, what you mean sold? It's been sold, Jacob. It's gone. Gone? Wait, I'm confused. Look, I didn't sell anything. See, this is exactly why I felt that we all should have power of attorney over our estate's affairs. Look, calm down, E. - Calm down? - I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding. Let me make a call and see what's going on. I know what's going on. Your company is suffering. You're losing clients, bad investments. So maybe you needed it, huh? But if you needed it, you could of at least told us. That's right. I spoke to Mr. Watkins. You know what he said? That he didn't want us involved. You in a real bad spot, man. Personally. So maybe, huh? All right, look, E, relax. I'm sure we'll figure this out. Yeah. You got something to say to me? I think I just said it. I think you need to be real clear about what you saying to me. All right, relax. It's not that serious, guys. J, pick up the phone, make the call, see what's going on. E, you and me, let's grab some air. Yeah, let's do that. Look like you could use one. Thanks. Everything okay? Yeah, we just had a slight issue today with Ethan. Issue, why? I mean, what happened? One of our properties got sold off without my knowledge. Trying to figure out what happened. Can they do that without your authority? I don't know. Well did you contact the... Yes, Mia! Sorry. No, it's fine. I'm sorry, I'm just a little worked up. I understand. Did you speak to Ethan about my job? What do you mean? Nothing, don't worry about it. But other than that, he's just been blowing me up saying we need to talk. About what? I don't know, you know him. He's just, he just keeps hitting me up saying we need to talk. Talk about what? I mean, your guess is as good as mine. Probably just needs me to come in and course correct or something. I um. I slept with Ethan. (ominous music) I met him a year before I met you and I'm sorry, I should of told you. (ominous music) I'm sorry. Please say something. Get your goddamn hands off me. (ominous music) [Dr. Connors] Mia. Are you all right? I'm uh. I'm just tired. [Dr. Connors] I understand. Can we skip today, please? [Dr. Connors] Of course. (ominous music) All you need is me. I'll take care of you. Everything happens for a reason. (phone ringing) This is Jacob Patterson. No, I haven't spoken to her. Did you try to call her? I'm not sure why she's not there. Yes. Yes. I understand. Okay. Hey, Mia. Your job just called me. They said you haven't been to work in the past couple days. They haven't heard anything from you. Give me a call when you get this. (eerie ominous music) Mia. Mia. Mia. (eerie tense music) Mia, Mia, Mia. (eerie tense music) [Watts] Mia Patterson, 33. Apparent overdose on prescription pills. Come on, man, what is this? [Sykes] Relax, sir. It's just a formality. Formality? My partner, Detective Sykes, likes to use fancy words and shit but I'm Watts and we'll be handling your wife's case. What case? [Sykes] Well, we discovered certain anomalies involving your wife's death. Oh my god, man. [Watts] How many properties do you own, Mr. Patterson? What's that got to do with anything? You've recently had some financial issues that lead to you selling off one of your properties. I see you recently made changes to your insurance policy, for you and your wife. [Jacob] Wait, what? Is that your signature? Yeah, I signed it but my wife normally takes care of all this stuff. [Watts] Prescription changes as well, which you picked up. Look man, what are y'all saying? We're not saying anything. We're just asking questions. [Watts] What are y'all nervous for? It's just a few questions. I'm not. Am I a suspect? Because if so, maybe I need to... Good afternoon, gentlemen. Mr. Collin Hicks, Mr. Patterson's legal representation and if we're done here, I would like to take my client down to identify his wife's body. (laughing) Lawyered up real quick, huh? I see you. Thank you, gentleman. Mr. Patterson. What do you think? I'm not sure just yet but let's check into his wife's financial to see what we come up with. Roger that. What is this and who are you? I'm your lawyer, Mr. Patterson. My lawyer? My lawyer is an old white dude and you sir are not him. Look, I'm well aware of your current representation, I was referred by a mutual contact who thought I could assist with this matter. Matter? Look, my wife is dead. I'm just trying to figure all this out. Precisely and I'm here to help figure things out but, Mr. Patterson, we need to go and identify your wife's body. Just trying to get some answers. I'm trying to give them to you. Now, please. I'm scared. [Dr. Connors] Why are you scared, Mia? (tense electronic music) (sobbing) Mr. Patterson. (tense electronic music) And they think that you had something to do with it? I don't know what they're thinking. They looking at the money, the properties, all of it. Damn. I'm just trying to process it. Yeah. Bro. What's good? How you feeling? Good, man. (eerie tense music) Oh man, I'm sorry. This is my fiancee Alexis Cooper. Alexis. Fiancee? There must be something in this water. How did you manage to keep that a secret from the two of us for so long? Well, that's why I've been blowing you two up. I wanted to tell y'all together. She's been back and forth out of town and you know we've been kind of on and off and finally I decided to make it official and once we got the news about Mia... I'm sorry, J. Well. Devin, I presume? Nice to meet you. You, too. And you must be Jacob. I've heard a lot about you. Bitch, you need to get the hell out of my house. Wait, whoa, whoa. What the hell is wrong with you? She's here to support me. Support you? Both of y'all can get the hell out of my house. Man, y'all, chill for real. Get your hands off me, man. You know you got problems. You deal with that shit. Come on, Lexi. (tense music) What the hell is wrong with you, bro? I'm good. Aight, man. (tense music) Here we go. Where is this dude going? Are you sure we should be doing this? Relax, we're fine. Just keep an eye on him. I just don't want to step on his rights. (laughs) We're good. All right. (tense music) What are you doing here, man? You sent that bitch, didn't you? [Ethan] What are you talking about? And you fucked my wife. (tense music) (laughing) Man, look at this shit here. Now this is interesting. Should we help? No, they're brothers. Let it play out. Get off of me. You all right? Man, look you need to relax on Mia and I, all right? It's complicated and whatever you have towards Alexis, you leave her out of it, all right? Your girl, Alexis. I fucked her. So I guess we even. (tense music) (tense music) (tense music) (eerie tense music) (soft thudding) (tense music) (tense music) I'm losing my mind. (grunting) (eerie music) (groaning) (eerie tense music) You still taste good. Why? You had everything. You had her but she's mine. Not your brothers, not yours but mine. Ethan. Oh him? Don't worry about him. You'll see him really soon. You killed him? Oh me? No, not me. (eerie tense music) Hi, honey. (groaning) Hi, baby. I killed him. Slit his throat from ear to ear and it was so easy to get close to him because he couldn't control what was in between his legs. Oh I need you. Don't leave me, I can be better than her. (mock crying) Men. Why are you doing this? Because I can. I'm dead, remember? And you signed power of attorney over to Mr. Collin. Don't look so shocked. [Jacob] All this over money? Of course not. This is about me getting all that I deserve. My own little slice of heaven, all of it. [Jacob] You're crazy. (laughs) Maybe. Kill him so we can go already. You go ahead, I'll catch up. [Alexis] What? Go. Go. (eerie tense music) (wheezing) Back to you... Jacob? (tense music) You guys are so predictable. A lonely wife. The alluring girlfriend. The disloyal brother. Easy, easy, easy. All I had to do was keep chipping away. My life was meant to be so much more than you could give me. (tense music) (groaning) (tense music) (eerie tense music) (energetic tense music) (gunshot) (tense electronic music) I see you recently made changes to your insurance policy for you and your wife. [Mia Voiceover] There's some paperwork in there that still needs your signature. Your money has been erratic for the last year or so. Yeah. [Watts] Is that your signature? I'm scared. (eerie tense music) [Watts] What you picked up. Is that your signature? It's my job. That's why I worry. (eerie tense music) (gasping) Jacob, Jacob calm down, bro. I'm right here. You're good. How long was I out? Like 10 days. And E? He didn't make it. Oh Jesus. That Alexis chick, she went psycho man. She cut his throat and then she came after you. What about Mia? Mia, what do you mean, what about her? Mr. Patterson. Glad to see you join us in the land of the living. Yeah. Detectives, how can we help you? Just following up on those anomalies. And? And the reason we brought you in, Mr. Patterson, was because we thought you were being targeted for some sort of scam and it turns out our suspicions were spot on. Your wife and this gentleman. The lawyer. He and Mia were actually brother and sister. Donna and Kevin Paradise. Her brother's IQ is off the charts, bio-chemist, borderline genius. Meaning he's fully capable of coming up with a concoction to slow a heart rate to resemble death. So she never died? [Watts] Nope. [Sykes] How well did you know your wife, Mr. Patterson? Well I didn't dig into her past or anything like that. They like to play the long game, get in, find the money, the properties, create the avenue and exploit it. [Jacob] Wow. And you and your brother were the targets. They take over lives, then move on, start again. Some sort of sick, twisted game to them. We can probably trace this back to six other cases like yours. All across the US. That's some Invasion of the Body snatchers type shit. You got lucky. More than likely because of the girl. Dana Jordan. She was the newbie they hired to get to you and Ethan and when she couldn't do the job, she was expendable. Alexis. What about Mia? [Watts] She disappeared, her brother, too but if it means anything, we're not letting this one go. I appreciate it. Take care of yourself. Damn, bro, that's crazy. Like something straight up out of a movie. Got me second guessing trusting these women now. Like for real. Alice might have to get the rundown. (laughing) For real, bro. Don't make me laugh. Oh man. [Dr. Connors] So, what's next for you, Mr. Patterson? Some time off. Maybe a trip to paradise.
