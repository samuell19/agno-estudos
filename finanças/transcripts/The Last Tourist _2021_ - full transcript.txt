It all began by a dream I had. A premonitory dream. I dreamed that a man was looking for me to bring people. He was telling me : "There you go people. "Show them around." I destroyed a rock 6000 years old. The Quechua people listens to the waterfall who guides them. He is our master. Here we can stop. I know this place. All communities know him. It's a very special place. because there are spirits. The spirit of an anaconda. Or maybe a tiger. And these spirits transmit to us their strengths. Listen. Do you accept me? Or are you refusing me? If we listen well, we hear them through the rock. Listen. Sometimes it feels like to hear a melody. When we hear this melody, that means we can enter the temple. Before, I lived in Phnom Penh, and then I moved in Siem Reap for this work. It's been 18 years that I do this job. Here are the paintings that I sell the most for foreign tourists. They want paintings of the temple of Angkor. We see the architecture of the temple of Angkor. I know it by heart. One for a dollar. One dollar, please. One dollar. The river brings us water, and that's all we got. There is not much work, here. It's difficult. I do maize cultivation, in Otendo. They are our ancestors who taught us to grow corn. That's a seed. I sow it to harvest next year. Young people try to find work in tourism. They try to work in it, because corn, with global warming, it's not enough to provide for the needs of the family. I have five daughters, and three sons. That's eight kids. If I worked in tourism, I would earn more. I will have more comfortable income to live and support of the whole family. Without tourism, there would be no money. My grandparents have spent their whole lives here. And I've lived here since I was born. Since the age of seven or eight, we learn to do that. It was my grandmother who taught me. My grandmother washed his clothes like that. She had no laundry. I followed my mother in its activities. I looked at my mother and my grandmother to weave. Fast ! With technical advances, even us, here, we don't work anymore in the same way than our grandparents at the time. With some comrades, we didn't remember how to make dyes from plants, flowers. We had forgotten how to spin, how to use the distaff. There, we have condors, animals, flowers, a woman, fishes. Here is the sun. Here, the mountain. This is the illustration of our coexistence with nature. Pachamama is Mother Earth, and land is very important, for us. And thank God, I am one of the women who are very attached to our culture. I did not want let our culture disappear. I said to myself : "It is not possible, "I'm a woman and I will work." We were 22 women at the start. We said to ourselves: "We are going to reproduce this drawing, this reason." We helped each other to learn. We relearned to weave, like our grandparents. We reproduced the covers, the ponchos they made. We encouraged each other. We worked as a team. All together. between women, we gave each other strength. And the business grew. We started to redo the work what they used to do. But it was very sad. We weren't making any money. We didn't know where to sell what we made. nobody believed me when I said: â€œOne day, tourists will come. Get to work!" Nobody believed me. They said that no tourists would come. They said I was lying to them. The boys do what they want. They have no limits. They have no pressure for anything. But for girls whether they are daughters-in-law or daughters of the family, there is no freedom. men think that if women go out or work, they will no longer listen to them. People are wrong about women. We have seen abused elephants who made money. They hit them with a pickaxe and force them to do things that they wouldn't in their natural environment. They have cuts, wounds. They are tortured. We saw the elephants get hit hard. Tourists strolled on their backs, as they bled from the head. Yet tourists seemed to have a good time and didn't seem to notice the suffering of elephants. I'm not going to play anymore. You didn't beat me. You hit me, little baby. So I'll hit you. I regret very much what I have done. I had problems. I couldn't feed him nor pay him school. I had no help. The only solution for me, was to put it in an orphanage. What hurts me the most, is to have lost my child, for abandoning my baby. Faa May! This way ! Come on ! Medo! They can eat now. I had an arranged marriage. At 22, I said to myself it would be nice to get married. One day he beat me so hard that I bled from the nose. I remained unconscious two o'clock. They didn't even try to take me to the hospital. That day I decided that was no longer possible. I just took my license and the papers I had. I got a work permit and I left. Foreigners support us all and are very happy to meet us. They always ask us the things worth visiting in Old Delhi and New Delhi. At the start of my training, I was very scared. I was wondering how I was going to get there. It was the first time in my life that I was leaving my house. These signs make sense and we understand them. You have all the leaves with traffic signs? It's the brake fluid. - Is that the brake fluid? - Yes. Transmission oil. The maximum level and the minimum level. Look, that's the level. It's been six years that I am a taxi driver. I am very proud of what I do. Our society think this work is reserved for men, and that women cannot exercise it. I proved them wrong and we could do it. That's why I'm doing this. I got the divorce papers only last week. I am so happy, I have no words to express it. That day, we had the impression of dreaming. We could finally make money. We showed them what we were doing, our blankets, our clothes, our scarves, our baby clothes, all sorts of things. I asked them if they could bring in tourists. Before, the village did not look like what you see. There were no houses what you see there. Before, the street was like that. Today they are paved so that there is no mud. Today we can send our children study, we have a better life. We built a school. My daughters are studying. My youngest is in college. The tourists are passionate about weaving. We are happy to show them what we do within our village. We show them all the craftsmanship what we do here. This is my humble abode in which I live with my husband and two daughters. He gives me a hand. Me, I'm going to work. We both help each other. There are foreign tourists who come to stay in our house. Right now, I have a tourist couple. They slept here. We went to the farm to work, we cooked together we had breakfast together. Go ahead, take more. - Do you want more ? - It's very good. THANKS. Community tourism, organized tourism break down all barriers, not for the purpose of destroying, but with the aim of improving. It opens people's minds. Tourism is not a job, it is love, for me. It represents support. A training. your symbol, she is the water woman. The Woman of the River or rain. With these symbols, our shamans communicate with spirits. You have to jump like this, like Spiderman. We come from an Omahua family, from the region of the Amazon River. Our people went up the river and finally settled here. We got these lands to survive. And it's our duty to preserve these places. These are the stones what our ancestors used to make weapons. Like this stone. Our ancestors were panning for gold. With it, they made cups, pottery... Before there were tourists, we were looking for gold in small streams. Sometimes we found a little and it allowed to buy food. Because before, without gold, we had nothing to eat. But today, we eat three meals a day, like tourists. Dear gold, we cherish you Dear gold, watch over us Give us your treasure Give us your fruits, dear gold Today, we say it was worth it. It was worth it. We did it. We can't stop. The rainforest is my life. It's my oxygen. We come from the earth. Our bodies and our minds come from this land, of this rainforest. The forest is a living being that enters us. We feel in us what this forest offers us. It is said that the spirit of the Pachamama is in the mud. The mud purifies us. The earth purifies us. So is our life. Our ancestors are our guides. We do not learn from their writings, but by the energy that they send to us. It all began by a dream I had. A premonitory dream. I dreamed that a man was looking for me to bring people. This man arrived by boat. In a big boat. He was telling me : "There you go people. "Show them around." And we went to sea. The sea was very rough and the passengers asked: "Why didn't we sink?" They asked me how was it. I said : "When we do things well, "when we harm no one, "and that we do not damage anything, "we are going forward."
