(soft music) (people chattering quietly) - Take your positions. - Okay, we should go. - [Stella] Mary, you can sit right there. - She's eating the petals. Little girl, don't eat the petals. Tess, she's, she's eating the petals. - Sweetheart, we have to go now. Everything is gonna be perfect. Don't think for a moment it isn't. - Okay. - This day! - Clem, you look beautiful. - I tried so hard. - Oh boy. - And begin. (bells pealing) ("The Wedding March" by Felix Mendelssohn) (camera shutter clicking) - [Stella] Okay, we have the bride's family on this side, and groom's over here. - Yeah, we-we're all here, go ahead and take the picture. - No, wait, mama? Mama! Quickly! - Okay. (camera shutter clicking) - [Stella] Excellent, let's just do one more of the bride's parents. - Up here? - Please. (camera shutter clicking) (upbeat band music) - [Man] Had her above the steering wheel. (George laughing) - Oh, that's funny. Oh, I'll be over there. Excuse me. - Yeah. Joe, come here. Hey Joe, come here a second. My son, Joe. He's a freshman at Princeton this year. - Oh, excellent. - Our granddaughter is so happy. (Mama Bell laughing) I'm so happy! Aren't you happy? - That's a lovely gown, dear. - Oh, thank you. - Are you having fun, mama? - Oh, oh, yes. (Mama Bell laughing) - Okay. - How's school? - It's great. - Gotta keep that grade point up. - Yeah. - You know, stay in honors. - Yeah. - [Kate] Dance with me, darling. - Yes, mother. - I just had a very interesting chat with a board member on the Estonian project. They're pushing to hire a local architect. - I don't want to over-curl. - No. - No. Are my eyelashes sticking together? - Um, no. Oh, there's a smudge of mascara. - Mom! Oh mom, I still feel-- - What? - I just wanna have a happy marriage. I want my marriage like yours: perfect. - Yeah, you will. There, that's perfect. - You and dad, you have so much passion, when you threw a pumpkin at him-- - Mmhmm. - From the third floor window, and it splattered all over his aviator jacket. - Took him by surprise. - He recited poems to you. Tad and I, I've known him my whole life, we climbed trees together, we went to college together-- - Yeah. - I don't think I'm feeling what I'm supposed to be feeling. I don't feel that passion. I just sort of feel affection, adoration and fate. - Clementine? Stella wants to know if it's time for the butterflies. - Oh, five minutes. - It is so original. - Thanks, mama. - And you're a vision. (chuckling) - Oh my God! I'm marrying my best friend! What do I do? - Uh, honey, you're having cold feet is all. - Did you have cold feet? - A little, before I married. You're already married. - I know, I know. What should I do? - Sweetheart, it's all a crapshoot. We have the butterflies. - All right. Butterflies... - As the Indian legend goes, if anyone desires a wish to come true, they must capture a butterfly, and whisper that wish to it. Since they make no sound, they can't tell that wish to anyone but the Great Spirit. Today, Tess and Tad have chosen to keep this tradition by performing this unique form of Native American celebration. Please join them and release your butterflies. (gentle flute music) (all cheering and clapping) (Tess laughing) She was so beautiful and innocent. Do you think they'll be happy? - I think. The butterflies? - Yes. - How much were the butterflies? - 15. - A piece? - I didn't want to go with the painted ladies. The gulf fritillaries and the monarchs have a greater wingspan, and don't have to be coaxed out of their envelopes. - How many butterflies did we have? - 400. The effect was spiritual. My heart stopped. - Mine didn't fly, it was dead. - Oh! - Perhaps it was an anomaly. - Yes. (soft music) (phone ringing) Hello? - Mom. - [Clem] Sweetheart, did you get back to Princeton? - Yeah. - So, where are you? - Uh, the dorm. Are you and dad still going on that trip to Maine? - [Clem] Yeah. - Mom, whatever you need to do is okay with me. - Okay, uh, but I don't, I don't know what you mean. Your sister called, and they're gonna be in Belize two weeks. - [Joe] The wedding was great. - Yeah, did you like the butterflies? - Yeah. (Clem laughing) - Yeah, thanks, I-I really think they took the whole thing to another level. - Well, I have to go study. - [Clem] Okay, well, I'm glad you called. I'm glad you're safe. - Bye, mom. - [Clem] Bye. (dog barking) (horn honking) (upbeat music) - It's so beautiful. - Yeah? - I had her detailed. - The camper? - The Airstream. Oh come on, Clem, are you gonna bring all of this? - I packed some things. - Yeah, they have stores on the road, Clem, and restaurants. - Yeah-- - We're gonna be eating in restaurants. - Well, I just-just wanted to bring some things, some car food. - I don't wanna clutter everything up, you know? The space is craft, it's so artful. - This is a gourmet dish just for tonight. - All this toilet paper? - I like to have toilet paper and tissues. Paper products. - We're only gonna be gone-- - Leave it! Then just leave it. - Okay, fine, I hear the voice. - I don't think this is a good idea. This is a stupid idea. - Yeah, well, it was your idea. - Two years ago, I was soaking in the bathtub, and you came in and told me you wanted a divorce. - Christmas, Montauk. You said the marriage was over, you wanted out. - That was after the bathtub. And you're the one who insisted we don't need lawyers. - Oh, well, we don't. Come on, it's more civilized. Look, we can work this out, we're reasonable people. Why make it ugly? - I want to take my things. - Okay. - I have to feed the fish. A lot. So it was your idea. - About the lawyers, not about you coming on the trip. Doing it all on the trip, that was you. - When else were we gonna do it? You've been building and working and traveling for two solid years. Now you gotta take a pilgrimage to some rock. - You wanted to wait for Joe to go to college, and the wedding. - Well, I'm ready now. - You know something... Look, Clem, we're-we're friends. Neither of us wants to take advantage of the other. - No. I don't, really I don't, George, and it's time. It's really time. - We had some good years. - Some very good ones. - Well, let's try to hold onto that. ♪ I can't believe that you love me ♪ ♪ I can't believe I'll finally see ♪ ♪ The day come by when you'd say hi ♪ ♪ Let's stand a minute together ♪ - [Clem] So wonderful, the trip, the road trip. - [George] Yeah. - Oh, my God, it's gonna blow people's minds. - What? - They are gonna be so shocked that we're getting a divorce.

It's your dream house. - Clem, are you sure? - Yes. - 'Cause I poured my blood and guts into that design, regardless of who thinks what about it. - Exactly. - Finally, I had the freedom, you know, to create and conceptualize my authentic vision of spare and tough modernity. - And you should have it, George. - I'll buy out your interest, I'll make it extremely equitable. - Thank you. - No, thank you. ♪ A 60-second minute ♪ Now just a gall darn minute with you ♪ - "Mountains seemed a vast aggregation of loose rocks, "as if some time, it had rained rocks, "and they'd lay as they fell on the mountainside." - Wow. - Yeah, that's what I want to see, the power of that, the shape of that violence. - Rained rocks.

Mmm, I think you are so inspired and I-- - You know, if I get this commission, I could get back on the radar. I mean, I... I'm sorry, I'm interrupting you. - No, I just think you're really inspired, and I think they'll pick you, your proposal. - It's nice being with you. - Yeah. - Now that we're friends, I feel like we can talk. - I know, about your work, and-- - [George] Yeah. - Would you like some dessert? - Why not? (soft piano music) (waves lapping) - [TV Announcer] Batting .351 in 16 games, he had four homers and 13 RBIs.

Oh! - Mmm! - Oh my God, that's divine. - Mmm-- - What? - Darling, if I may call you darling, my once and long ago darling-- - Please do call me that. - Darling, now that it's over, everything's settled, we're friends, I'm gonna ask you something. - What? - Did you sleep with other women? - No, I... (George stammering) It doesn't matter. See, you know, we're friends, you know? We had good years, we-we raised two children together. - We raised three children together. - Yes, of course, three. - You always forget Bobby. - No, I don't. - No. - You always blame me for getting him the bike. - No-- - Yeah, well-- - No. Why would I? We were good parents. - I think we were. - I put the children first ahead of everything else, and maybe that was a mistake. - I understood. Children need everything because they're children. - You didn't mind? - No, God no. I'm a, you know, I'm a grown man and I-- - And you got your needs met. - Clem, you know... - I won't get upset, I just wanna know who it was. Or is. Was there more than one? Come on, I know there's someone because you and I haven't-- - No, I'm not. - It's been over two years, so, you know, and I understand you have needs. I have needs. We're all human beings. You get tired of the same one. - Clem, I-I don't want to do anything to hurt you. It-it's settled, we're, we're friends, good friends. - You don't have any friends. It's just, I'm... Men have trouble keeping friends. They're not known for intimate relationships. - I can't eat anymore of this. - Oh... Of course, you're my friend. I don't know why I said that. You have friends. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - [George] Hey, Clem. - [Clem] What? - Come here. - What? - It's raining. - Yeah, it is raining. - The sound of the rain. (thunder rumbling) (chuckling) - Are you... - Yeah. - What, for old time's sake? - Yeah, if you like. - We're insane. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (birds chirping) - Morning. - Good morning. - Cool morning. - It rained, yeah. - Yes. About... - What? - Well, I don't wanna complicate things. - Nothing's complicated. - It's not? - No. We had sex, that's all, we're adults. - Okay. (phone ringtone beeping) That's yours. - Yes. Okay Tess, calm down, where's Tad? - I don't know! Uh, looking through the Wall Street Journal. I wanna come home, I can't breathe! I feel sick, mom! - That's anxiety, sweetheart. Honeymoons, sometimes the pressure of them-- - Pressure, what pressure? There is no pressure. We watched the game last night. I ordered champagne and pastries and ice cream sundaes. - That sounds fun. - I was trying to be a bon vivant like you, and Tad said that I don't need to order so many desserts. I think he thinks I'm fat. - So, so you didn't-- - Have sex? Oh no, we had sex, it's just, it wasn't, it wasn't special. It's my honeymoon, and the sex wasn't special! - Sweetheart-- - I'm coming home. (sighing deeply) (uptempo Latin music) - That was Tess. The honeymoon's a disaster, she's coming home. - I knew that kid was a prick. - Really? I didn't, I like him. Okay, well, we have to go. - Well, we lost half the morning, we're not gonna get to Mount Katahdin until after dark. - George, we can't go to that mountain, we have to go home. Tess is flying in from Belize. - So she'll see us in four days. - We can't do that, she needs us. - Clem, the whole point of this trip is for me to climb Thoreau's mountian, to take photographs, do sketches, study shapes. - Okay, I don't think you understand. This is an emergency. - No, it's not. Tess is a grown woman. - [Clem] She's 21! - Exactly. You know, you always treat our children like babies. Well, they're not, they're grown ups, you know? They're old enough to marry-- - I have to go home! - We're going to Mount Katahdin. Tess will be fine. - You are so selfish! It is always your work! I've had to squeeze our whole divorce in on this road trip. And what is this for? A commission you don't even have. It's not an emergency. - You don't understand. You know, you have never understood my work, how-how important, how vital, you just don't get it. You're always running around, throwing out cushions and pillows. - Because I don't want to sit on ice-cold metal all day-- - That is architecture, I am an architect. I do not do interior design. But you don't have the aesthetic grasp of a gnat. - And I don't want it! I just want a comfortable chair! - Oh, a beanbag chair? - Snob, you snob! The way you-you kept leaving my mother out of the wedding photographs until I felt sick. - I could never find her! She was always off blowing her nose. - She has allergies! - She's always got a little shred of tissues coming out of every sleeve, out of every pocket. - Your mother is so superior, so unkind, the way she complimented my mother on her dress! - Yeah, well at least she tries. You can't say she doesn't try. You know, having to set insects loose at her granddaughter's wedding? - You thought they were tacky? You thought the butterflies were tacky? - Excessive, yes. - Oh! (Clem shouting angrily) Please, let's go home. - I can't. - Damn it, George. - I at least intend to go to that mountain and take photographs. - How long will that take? - We will get close tonight. Tomorrow morning, I will see the mountain, view it from afar, and then we will leave. - Fine. Let's get this over with. Start up the divorce-mobile! - You know something... (door slamming) (uptempo Latin music) - Thanks. - A freak snowstorm's headed for the northeastern states. A cold front near the Canadian border will move slowly south through northern New England. Blizzard warnings have been issued for much of New York. - Joe? - Hey. - What are you doing here? - Nothing, why are you here? - 'Cause I'm back. - [Joe] Aren't you supposed to be on your honeymoon? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Okay. Do you want some cheese things? - No. - Mom and dad went to Maine. - I called mom. They're coming home tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yeah, and here they are, you know, they're trying to have a second honeymoon, and I ruin it for them. - Second honeymoon? (chuckling) Tess, it wasn't that. - Yeah, I think it was, sort of. I think that they were inspired by my wedding. Oh my God. Oh my God, I ruined my life. I ruined my life! Oh! (Tess sobbing) - Keep your eye out for a Campground Chimney Pond. - How long have you had this camper? - The Airstream? About two years. - Well, it's the first time I've been on a trip with you in the Airstream. - I usually like to go by myself, in search of solitude and peace. - A four-bedroom house, a home office, and an office office, and you don't have enough space? - No, I don't. - Do you remember when you lost that drawing for the Didawick home? - Yes. - Well, I came out to look for it in this camper. I found a tube of lipstick. A bronze. Later, there were other things, predictable items, a barrette, an ankle bracelet-- - Thelma Bridgewater, I was seeing Thelma Bridgewater. I still am. - Thank you, I just needed to know the truth. - Okay. (soft music) - [Joe] Hey, I quit school. - No, you didn't. - Yeah, I'm gonna go build houses in other places where they need them. You know, Jimmy Carter. - Jimmy Carter, why? - I don't know. (glasses clinking) Thought I might need something. - Mmm. When do you go? - I don't know. I just call 'em, tell 'em that I'm available. - Does dad know? - No, I just decided. - He's gonna kill you. You're the smart one, you're supposed to be some big something. - How about you? I mean, that big wedding thing you did? Where's Tad? - I don't know. Belize, I guess? Belize. (Joe chuckling) (soft crunching) - Thelma Bridgewater? - I knew we shouldn't. - Oh! It's fine, it's fine, it doesn't matter, because it's over and now I know, and you know, and we can just admit you weren't perfect. People can't be perfect. They'll be decent, but you weren't, so let's just acknowledge reality for a change. - Fine. I mean, I don't think, well, were you such a saint? - She is perfect for you. - I'm sure there was some. Hans Lobel? That phony do-gooder down at the, uh, the shelter? I know, what's-his-name, what's-his-face, the uh, the earnest veterinarian with the foundation for repairing declawed cats. - Mark? He's a very dedicated person. (scoffing) - So it was Mark? - No. - Who? - Unfortunately, I was pathetically faithful. - No you weren't. No you weren't, I know, I know. That must be the turn coming up. - I was. - You're lying. - Call me a liar? - Don't! - Damn you! - Hey, wait, don't-- - Arrogant prick! - I'm telling you-- - You're a lousy cheat! - For crying out loud-- - Jeez, you're swerving all over the road! - Because you were hitting me! - Well, we could have died. We could have died. - I hate it when you whine. - And I hate it when you breathe! - Look... So, who was it? - No one. - I was honest with you. - I beat it out of you. - Yeah, well, I'll beat it out of you. I know you did it. I'm sure, because... - What? - Last night. You were doing things last night you didn't do before. New things. - Seemed like you thought it was okay. - It was okay, it was okay. But new, a lot of new. Makes me wonder, how did you know? - Just wonder on that one, jerk. - Bitch. - Don't speak to me. Don't speak to me! - Fine. (quirky music) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) - Do you see the campground? - I can't see a damn thing. - Well, this can't be right. I think we're on the wrong road. - Do you have my glasses, my reading glasses? Clem, could you give me some help here? - God, every time I do anything, you yell at me. - That's 'cause I can't see anything, and you won't help me with the map. - I tried, but you, you get so upset. - Get my glasses, would you, please? (dramatic music) Son of a bitch! (tires screeching) (Clem shouting) (tree limbs cracking) Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay. I hurt my arm, I bumped my shin. I told you the road was slick, I told you to pull over. Why don't you listen to me? - There was a giant moose, we almost crashed into this living moose. Oh, Clem, let me see your arm-- - Don't go near me. - All right, I'll get you some, something for it, some ice. (rain pounding) Oh my God. - What? - Well, there's all this mud. We're stuck in some mud hole. - We're in a hole? Well, call 911, or some rescue someone. - I'm-I'm not getting a signal. - Oh, what? Let me turn mine... Come on. Where are the dots? I can't get a damn dot. Poor Tess. I can't even call her to see if she made her flight home. - Well, again, I'm sure tomorrow-- - She'll be all alone. - I'll take a little walk, and I'll-I'll get a signal. Here, here, put the ice on. - Oh, I can't believe I let her go on that honeymoon. She told me that she had some doubts, but I went on and I encouraged her because of the... Because of the butterflies. (Clem sighing) I thought they'd be pretty, I thought people would say how original. I just went and betrayed my own child because of a stupid vanity. I'll never forgive myself. All those butterflies. I killed all those butterflies, just for show. Just for show. - You did not kill the butterflies. - But they'll die, away from their natural habitat. It's too cool for them in Connecticut. - Look, it-it doesn't matter, Clem. They-they lived a long time, as larva and cocoons and as caterpillars. I mean, that-that's the bulk of their existence. They're only butterflies for a few days. Maybe a week. - Really? That's so sad. Well, I have this great big bump on my arm. Now what are we gonna do? - We're fine, we-we had an accident. You know, a moose got in our path. It was bad luck. You know, uh, we'll get outta here tomorrow. - Okay, we'll just be here tonight? - Yeah, let's not stay. (birds calling and screeching) As far as I can tell, we're somewhere. We took I-95 north to Millinocket. Did-did we go through Millinocket? - I don't remember a town. - I think we did. Then we got on this one lane road to Camp Chimney Pond. Did you see a sign? - [Clem] No. - Oh, it doesn't matter. You know, I'm just gonna walk a mile or so and catch a signal on the phone and get AAA out here. - Take one of these whistles. - What for? - Oh, I brought Joe's teen adventures emergency kit. I can't believe we have to use it. - I don't need a whistle. - No, you could get lost. And-and bundle up. And uh, and take food. - I'm only going for a couple of miles. - No, food is your heat. It says here. Food is your heat. - All right, fine, fine, fine. (loud squelching) Oh! - You okay? - [George] Oh, a lot of mud. - Oh, it's so cold. Ooh. Tell 'em to bring us some food. Some cheeseburgers. And soup. Sweet potato soup. - I'll try. I mean, it's AAA, Clem. For crying out loud. - Okay, okay. - Yes, we know, we've spoken to Joe, and we're aware of his whereabouts. Everything is A-OK. Joe doesn't want to go to college. Some kids don't. I'll take care of all of that. I appreciate your concern. All right, goodbye, Mrs. Parker. - Who was that? - Oh, the school. - You were pretending to be dad? - Yeah. - That's not legal. - Really? (upbeat pop music) ♪ And now there's nowhere to hide ♪ ♪ I see that look in your eyes, yeah ♪ (bird calling) - Oh, come on, damn it. (bird screeching) Huh. (bird screeching) (dramatic music) (wind howling) (whistle blowing) (wind howling) Clem, I'm out here! Help! Hey! Anybody, help! (breathing heavily) - Oh my God... Oh my God. (whistle blowing) - Clem? Clem! Come out! (grunting) (whistles blowing) - [Clem] Oh! George! - Oh God. Oh, Clem. - George! - Clem. - Come on George, we're over this way. Oh... Do your face like this. Helps your face un-freeze. (water trickling) Oh, and oh, no. I hate the cold, you know I hate the cold. - Yeah, Georgia girl. - Um... To prevent hypothermia, the book says, we should sleep together. - Okay. - Naked. - Okay. - It's more heat. - I believe that. (wind howling) (microwave beeping) - Where are they? Mom said they were coming home. She said they'd be home today. - [Joe] Call her cell. - I tried both their phones, I keep getting voicemail. And she would call, she would find a payphone and call. (phone ringing) Hello? - Hello? Oh. Hello, Tad. Just a second. Tess? - I can't, I can't. - Uh, Tad, she still can't talk. One moment. Why can't you talk? - 'Cause I'm embarrassed, I wanna die. Just tell him I'm sorry I ruined his life. - Okay, Tad, she says she's sorry she ruined your life. No, I think she really means it. Mmhmm, okay, I'll tell her. Sure. Oh, let me just say, you know, for my own self, as her brother, I'm sorry about this. You're a good guy, and uh, well, it sucks. Sure. Okay, bye. - Traitor. - That guy's crying. (Tess sighing) - What did he say? - He wants to talk to you. Or get an annulment. - An annulment? I need to talk to mom. Where's mom? Where's my mom? (Tess crying) - [George] Freak blizzard. - [Clem] Must be global warming. - Thank you. - What? - You saved me. (Clem coughing) - I found you in the snow. - All along, I wanted to save you, then you saved me. - Yeah. - I always wanted to ask you this. Do you like our house? - Yeah. - But you don't want to live in it? - You know me, I have no taste. Lace curtains and overstuffed everything-- - The house doesn't work. The proportions are off, it's derivative, it's inadequately detailed. I aspire to more than I can deliver. That's my ugly little secret. That's why I work so hard, trying to tone down the mediocrity. - George... You are one of the most respected architects in Hartford. Your office has been established for over 20 years-- - My mother subsidizes it. You know that? - Not really. - She keeps it going. She brings in the clients, knows all the fat cats. (Clem scoffing) - What's wrong? - Everything. It all makes me sad. - I'm sorry. - God... Your toes are so cold. They're freezing. - And yours are warm. - I'm starting to get really scared. I think we should report them missing. - What? Who do we call? And tell them what, our parents haven't called, so send out a search patrol? - You don't know what you're talking about. You dropped out of college, you're an idiot. - And you screwed up your marriage in a record 25 hours? At least mom and dad made 20 plus years before they collapsed. - Collapsed? Mom and dad have a very good marriage. An ideal marriage, like I can never have. - They were in counseling for months. Dad stopped going, mom broke balls-- - Could you please be quiet? (Joe scoffs) - Dad's out of town all the time, going on his architectural pilgrimages to Montreal, Tibet. Mom is running around teaching origami to people captured in hospital wards. The whole thing is a total loss. - Mom and I are very close. She would have told me. (sighing) Do we know where they are? - Up a mountain. - Oh! - Thanks. (microwave beeping) - Let's have the soup. - You want the soup? - Yes. - Maybe we should save it. - And eat what? Mustard and marshmallows? - Okay, soup. You're good at that, very skilled. - I worked on a lot of AIDS quilts back in the 90s. - Oh, yeah. - Thanks. - You're a good person. Everything. Unwed homeless girls without prom dresses. - I'm not a good person. - Why not? - I'm a make-believe good person. Needy people... I don't like 'em, they need too much. I'm-I'm afraid I might become them, you know, have all this need and I would be-- - What? - Needy. (generator sputtering) - Oh. - What was that? - [George] The, uh, generator's dead. - [Clem] No electricity? - We'll work off the battery. - And how long will that last? - Not long. Maybe a day. - How's our soup? - Eh, it's lukewarm. I'll heat it on the stove. - [Clem] We-we still have the stove? - Yeah, yeah. Propane. - Now how do you know all that? - Ivy league education. (chuckling) - Okay, I got it. Tess, I got it! - What? - Mount Katahdin. Baxter State Park, that's where they are. - How did you get this? - From dad's internet history. - Okay, we have to just find them, 'cause I can't take this. I'm gonna call Grandmother Kate. - Well, how about Mama Bell? - Can't do anything, she'll just cry. - I know, I'll tell her anyway. (phone beeping) - Oh, this looks good. - Very visible. - If anyone comes by, they'll see it. - Someone in a snow plow or a snowmobile. - Yeah, they can't miss it. - [George] It's distinctive. Clem? - What? - We may have to be patient. - How patient? - I don't know, maybe very. - I'm so worried about Tess. She must be going crazy, wondering where we are. I'm sure she's called Joe, and now he's all upset. (plane engine droning) Oh my God! A plane! - Hey! - There's an airplane! Help! - Hey, down here! - Help! Help! - Down here, down here! Down, ahh! Down here! - Help! Please! - Down here! - Oh! Help! (Clem coughing) - Oh, damn it. Oh... Oh God, I didn't see it. - I know. - Here, hold me. We're gonna need to get something in a, more reflective. - The kids-- - Something from above-- - We have to let them know-- - Something they can see from the air. - That we're okay. (both groaning and breathing heavily) - [George] I didn't see it. (birds calling and screeching) (dramatic music) (phone beeping) (people talking loudly) - [Sharon] That's downstairs. Team Alpha, radio check. - [Team Alpha Rescuer] Team Alpha, loud and clear. - Team Bravo, radio check. - Copy that. - No, Bell, don't come. They've already started the search. They're well-organized. Well, six, six days since Tess talked to me. - It's hot. - Okay. No, no, the kids are fine. Bell, do not come all the way from Georgia. It's very cold here. - [Team Delta Rescuer] Search Base, it's Team Delta. - [Man] Copy that, Team Delta. - And how was your parents' relationship? They get along? - Yes, very devoted, they were very devoted. - Yeah, kind of. Except they were getting a divorce. - A divorce? - A divorce? - Yes sir. - You're insane! - Why would your parents go off on this trip together if they were getting a divorce? - They're not getting a divorce. - I heard some fight, Tess. Mom said dad didn't even consider her taking the time to divorce. And this time, she was going with him in the Airstream and get it worked out, or something. - Does either of your parents have a license for a firearm? - No. - No. I mean, not that we know of. - Not that we know of. - Great. (owl hooting) - I'm cold. - I know. - I'm just so hungry. - I'm 30 minutes, we can have a marshmallow. - Let's have half now. - You'll regret it, like the pickle. (sighing) - Maybe we should walk. - Your book says no. Stay with the shelter. Planes are out, you know? We just have to find a way to signal them, and I'm working on a plan. - I'm starving! - I'll make you some tea. - Don't be so nice. - I'm not nice. (chuckling) No, no, hey, hey, hey. Come on, we promised that we'd wait. (sighing) - You son of a bitch. One lousy marshmallow. - Your temper has always been impossible, you know that? I should have known, when you threw the pumpkin at me. - I thought you weren't coming back. We'd finally made love, and I thought you were never coming back. - I wanted to find you cornflowers. I wanted to bring you blue cornflowers. (Clem laughing) - You brought me irises and paperwhites. - I dropped them when the pumpkin hit, they were destroyed. (Clem chuckling) - I hate my temper. - Hmm. - Oh my God! - What? - Oh my God! - What? - [Clem] I threw that bag at you, remember? Cheetos! - Oh, you're kidding? - There's lots of them! - How many? - Um, six. - Oh my God, Payday! I dropped it! - Oh, oh, got it! - Oh, you're kidding me! - There's almost half a Payday! - I only had a couple of bites before you hit, oh, Clem, I love your temper! - Thanks. It's yours. - Well, we'll-we'll share. (quirky music) (both chuckling) (soft music) - What type of tea? - Um, I don't care. Green? - Yeah. (wind whistling) - Hey, Sharon. - Hi, guys. - Hey, hi. - You can go ahead and use my sleeping bag right there. - [Man] Great. - [Sharon] Okay, so the search area has expanded. - [Tess] Tad wants to come up. - [Joe] Is he coming? - I left him, now I'm in trouble, I need him. What if it's just for an emergency? That's not fair, is it? - I don't know. - I'll tell him not to come. - Okay. - Hey, Joe? - Yeah? - I wish mom would have told me they weren't happy. Did she tell you? - No. - Did dad tell you? - Why would he? (phone ringing) - It's Tad. Hi, Tad. - [Tad] Did you hear anything? - No. - How are you doing? - [Tess] I'm not so good. - I'm coming out. - [Tess] No, don't come. - You don't want me to come? - I mean, aren't you mad at me? - Yeah... I don't know, I mean, it's-- - Then you shouldn't come up. Look, Tad, I'm sorry, I gotta go. (phone beeping) (soft piano music) (birds calling) (people talking quietly) (engines revving) - [Tess] Oh my God it's Tad, he came! He came, he came! (Tess whooping) - Hey, look who was on the plane. - Joe! Joe, have you found them yet? - No. - I'm so glad you're here. - [Mama Bell] Well, do they know anything? - Nothing, they're still looking. - There you go. - Oh. Uh, listen, be careful, there's a cake in there. - Mama Bell! - Oh! - Here. - Hey. - [Tess] Okay, let's get you warmed up, come on inside. - [Mama Bell] Okay. - [Tess] I'm so glad you're here. - [Mama Bell] I know. (birds calling and screeching) - Authorization? I don't understand authorization. This is a life or death emergency! - Mrs. Gazelle, thermal imaging systems are on Army helicopters. - Is that a problem? - Government property, US military, we're required to get permission. - Well, get permission! - The National Guard has to do its search first. - You are being intractable! It's been over a week, this is obscene! I'm gonna call the Governor. What's his number? - Look in the phone book. - I'll have William call information. William! Where's my cell phone? - [Team Delta Rescuer] Search Base, this is Team Delta. - [Kate] We have to get the Governor. Call information. - Damn good muffin, is that persimmon? - It sure is! - Bell! What are you doing here? I told you not to come! You have no winter clothes. Look at your clothing! - I brought Clementine's favorite cake, lemon with white icing. - [Clem] Got it? - Yeah, yeah, good, good, good, I got it. Ow! Oh yeah. - Oh! - [George] Oh yeah, they're gonna see this. - Great, George! - Whew! We're going home! (coughing) Get me the pole, will ya? - [Clem] It was beautiful. - What? - Your reflector. - You thought so? - Mmhmm. (Clem coughing) I heard two, maybe three helicopters when we were putting it up. (George chuckling) - Hey, let's celebrate. Let's, let's eat the licorice stick. - [Clem] That's the only food we have. (George chuckling) - It's okay. Tomorrow we'll be outta here, away from this camper. - Mmm, the Airstream. (George chuckling) - [George] We'll be home and safe. - I want a hot bubble bath. (chuckling) - Scotch, steak, warm socks, and our own bed. (sobbing) - What's wrong? - I don't know. - What? - I won't be with you. - When? - When we go home. I won't. In here, it's all different, but there... I don't know, so much was wasted. (somber piano music) - You want the divorce? - You are having an affair, and lying to me. - I did that. I'm sorry. - Why did you do that? - I felt dead. - I made you feel dead? - I don't know, I... I got lost. - Well... What if you get lost again and start to feel dead? I can't go back. - No, you never forgive, do you? No. One time, my mother corrects your grammar, and that's it. Never forgiven. - All along, I felt I was right in your world, in your family. I smother myself, trying to be right! - I never wanted you to be right. - Yes, you did! That is all you wanted, from me, and from the children. From the children and I! We were just for show! - How can you say... You know, that's all you let me have. You-you never let me be part of my own family. You suck the kids up, you suck them up! - You pushed us away! - No! - Yes! - No, I couldn't get in. You never needed me, never. - I did need you! - No, no, you don't let yourself need. That's beneath you. - Well, maybe you just married the wrong woman. - Yeah. (wind whistling) - Your mama is gonna love Thelma Bridgewater. She's the perfect blue-blood mannequin. - Clem, what are you doing? You're gonna freeze! Oh, you... God! Oh, for... Clem! Oh... Clem! Clem! You're being a lunatic! (Clem coughing) - I'm sick. - [George] You'll be okay. - Get me warm? - [George] I will. (wind howling) (Clem coughing) - It's getting bad out there. - I can't believe this is happening. - Listen, I want to talk to everybody, so just stand by, okay? Folks-- - Yes, officer? - I just wanted to let you know I'm calling off the search. There's a storm starting up. - I won't hear this! I won't tolerate this stupidity! - The rescue workers-- - How much do they make? I will triple their overtime. - They're volunteers, Mrs. Gazelle. And I'm not going to put their safety in jeopardy. It won't be allowed. - No, of course not. When can they start back? - They're forecasting another blizzard rougher than the last one. We just have to wait and see. I'm sorry. - [Kate] Excuse me. I want to talk to you! Don't you walk away from me, I'm talking to you! (dramatic music) (birds calling) (reflector squeaking) (coughing) (birds calling) (wind whistling) (dramatic music) - Clem, what are you, jeez! - I saw him. He came for a visit. Bobby. - What are you... - I held him in these arms, more real than you, more real than you or my own hands. - Oh Clem, why, why? - He was cold. Bobby was cold, he was so cold, my boy. - Here, lie down here, please. - Hold me. Lie on me. - Oh my God, you're burning up. - Remember, I wouldn't, after he died, I wouldn't let you hold me for days, I wouldn't. - Yeah, for days. - My skin, it felt... Prickly and... Numb. It hurt, too-too much pain to be touched. - It's okay, I'm holding you now. - That day, he... That morning... Bobby was looking in the mirror. - Yeah? - Staring up his nose. (both chuckling) And he said... "Look, I have hairs up my nose, just like my dad." - He said that? - Yes. Just like you. (George chuckling) (dramatic music) (wind whistling) - No, no, no, one time, I'm not kidding, dad was putting in a new driveway, and Bobby, Bobby stuck his whole head in this barrel of cement, and he spikes it all out. - He was a cool little kid. - He used to tell him the house was haunted, and then we'd hide in the basement, and we'd flick the lights on and off. - We completely freaked him out. And mom got so pissed. (all laughing) - You never talk about him. - I guess we don't want to remind mom and dad. - You know, I can't believe that your parents are splitting up. You guys are like the perfect family. - Right, 'cause mom and dad are getting a divorce, and I'm a deserter, and Joe's a dropout. - Hey! Sweet, huh? (bottles clinking) To Bobby. - [Tad] To Bobby. - To Bobby. ♪ Looking out the window at this blanket of snow ♪ ♪ At the peacefulness of this cold wonder ♪ ♪ My body's aching, but right next to you, it's warm ♪ ♪ Unlike the air out there this cold December ♪ ♪ And I can't sleep, for my mind is not at rest ♪ ♪ And I know there's something that's stirring in my heart ♪ ♪ Let me run and hide - George and Clementine Gazelle of Hartford, Connecticut, have not been heard from in 10 days.

We got the-the heat-seeking chopper! - How do you know? - Officer Potts, he did it! We got the Army! - Oh, Tess! - They're going out! - And all my universe becomes perfection, but were you in my arms, dear love, the happiness would take my breath away. No thought can match that ecstasy. No song encompass it, no other worlds. If I should think of love... I'd think of you. (helicopter blades whirring) - [Kate] Sushi? - [Rescuer] Yeah, okay. Thanks. (rescue dog whining) - Oh, dear. - Sushi? - What's that? - That's yellowtail. - Okay, what's that? - Eel. - Okay. - Maybe I should have gotten those McNuggets that everybody likes so much? - Oh, this is fine, honey. It's very fresh. - Do you want some more? - Uh, no, no, thank you.

Oh my God! - Army One, send coordinates, over. - [Pilot] Roger. - We did it, we did it! - Clem, darling. Wake up, love. Listen to me. We're going home. - What is it? - Shh, shh. Yes? Oh, how bad? Well, what will you do? Yes, I understand. Well, we should be there within the hour. Yes, well thank you, thank you very much, you've been very kind. Thank you, bye-bye. Clementine has a respiratory infection. - Is she all right? - They've put her on an antibiotic drip. They both have frostbite. George in particular, his feet are severe. There's some hypothermia, dehydration-- - Is dad gonna lose his toes or something? - I don't know. - Were they conscious? Could they talk? - George could. - What'd he say? - He asked how your mom was and he asked to see his children. - Dad? - Wow. (soft music) - George? - Shh, she's asleep. Come here. - [Kate] Oh, dear. - Hi, daddy. - Hi, dad. - [Mama Bell] Clem, oh, baby! Oh, thank God! You'll be all right, darling. - [Tess] Is she gonna be okay? - [George] She's gonna be all right. - Clementine, honey, highlight the eyes. A little more with the eyes. (Clem scoffing) - I aged about 100 years. - You look beautiful. - Yes. A little frail, but... Just so beautiful. - Oh, mom. Hey, I keep smelling that cake. Let me see that cake again. Oh! I imagined it! Wait 'til George sees it! - I'll get us some coffee to go with the cake. Here. (Clem coughing) - Oh. - So I think, yeah, go build housing. - Right? Really, dad? - That's what I'd do. I really believe in that. Everybody needs some place to live. - Because dad, this, I think it would mean something. - Yeah. - George? - Thelma. - I've been so worried. So worried! - Uh, this is my son, Joe. Thelma... - But, uh, you're okay? George, you're okay? - Well, I think I'll go. - Joe... Thelma, why-why did you come here? - I had to see you. Everything's been running through my mind. I thought maybe she'd kill you out there in the snow with an ax or something. (quirky music) Oh, you're alive! - Yeah, yeah, I know. - Uh, here's a cake. Uh, Tess, take him the cake. - Well, that was horrible. - Yeah, that was. - [Clem] Dad and I are getting a divorce, it's all worked out. - Why didn't you tell me it was all a mess? - I didn't want you to know. I didn't want you to lose hope in love. - I just feel so stupid. - No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just, I wanted it to be pretty for you. Just... Idiotic butterflies. - Well, it's all a mess anyways. (sighing) Tad is having abandonment issues. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - Clem? Tess, please, could I speak to your mother? Clem... - What? - I'm sorry, she just came. - It's okay. We were away from it, now we're back. - I feel horrible. I love you. - Don't. I can't. Please go. You need to go. (soft piano music) (sighing) (birds chirping) - Dad, look. Habitat blitz builds. They're coming up all over. Newfoundland, Nicaragua, Nepal. Arizona? - Do we have fish food? - [Joe] Yeah, yeah. - [George] I think this fish is hungry. - Are you okay? - I miss her. - Tad stayed over last night. - Oh yeah? How is Tad? - Good. I mean, every time I kissed him, we both started to cry. - Oh. - Call her. - Oh, she-she won't... Hey, hey, hey, you-you call her and let me listen. - Dad, that is so sad. - Look, I know, I know, I'm sad, I'm pathetic. Come on, call her, okay? Please, just go-go get the other phone, come on. - What do I do? I feel so bad. - Did you tell him what you feel? - It's too hard. - I can try to tell you just about everything, Tess, but who to love and how to do it and that, you just gotta figure out for yourself. - Yeah. (phone ringing) - [Clem] Hello? - Hi, mom? - Joe! It's Joe. - I-I just called to say hi. - Hi, sweetheart. Tess is over, she's helping me unpack. - Clem, hi, it's George. - [Joe] Bye, mom. - No, no, don't... - Bye, Joe. - Because Joe was calling, I-I thought I'd, uh, call too. You know, I thought we would call together, because uh, I'm a hopeless coward. - No, you're not. George, you're... Very brave. I'll always remember how you saved me. - No, I didn't save you. It was special Army helicopters and night helicopters with thermal imaging systems found us. They-they never saw my reflector. I didn't save you. - Yes, you did and... And I saved you. - All right. - We're both saved, we're both back here, saved. - So what are we gonna do? - Break it up. - Can't we stay saved? Clem? - It's too hard. I have to go. I have to hang up. - I give up, it's too hard. (sniffling) - Okay. - You didn't tell him what you feel? - It's too hard. - Hey, you know, don't-don't tell me to give up. I'm too old to give up, I don't have the time. (sighing) (dog barking) (doorbell ringing) - Hi. - Hi. I-I just thought I'd, uh, drop by a housewarming. - Cornflowers. Thank you. - Oh. And, uh, this. - Thanks. Would you like to come in? - All right. It's nice. - It's corny. - No, it's good. You have a piano? - Oh, I asked mama to send it up. - You-you play? - I do. I mean, I used to. - I didn't know. Will you, uh, play something for me? - Uh, yes, after it's tuned. I have to teach myself again. - Yeah, naturally, yeah. Nice. (dramatic music) Nice. - So, is Joe still gonna do that blitz build for Habitat for Humanity? - Yeah. - And uh, you think he should quit school to do this? - Joe needs a different perspective. He wants to hammer. - I don't believe it. - How are Tess and Tad? - Confused. - Yeah, well, love is hard to survive. - I don't even have crackers. - [George] I love soup. - Me too. The fire's nice. - Warm. - Yes. (soft music) How are your toes? - Good. - You don't need the cane? - I put it in the bushes. - Really? - At the front door. - Why? - I'm trying to impress you. How's it going? - Good. I like the limp. - I can do more. (Clem laughing) (soft gentle music)
