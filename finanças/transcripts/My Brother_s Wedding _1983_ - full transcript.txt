Was lost, but now, I'm found. Was blind, but now... Lookie, lookie. Oh. There. Look at your belly. See, baby? See, baby? Oh. Hey, Pierce! Come see my sister's baby. What kind of friend are you if you don't wanna see my sister's baby? I gotta go see Soldier's mother. Soldier's mother sick? - No, but I gotta get - over there and back before my mother leaves. Oh, boy, come on. You got something against my sister or something? You got more excuses. Come on. Come on. Hey. Pick her up. She's too little. Pick her up. I might hurt her or break her. Haven't you ever held a baby before? No. Who's the daddy? You can be, if you want to. I don't need no responsibilities. Oh, you make me sick. I wish there was some way I didn't have to deal with men. Look, I came over here to see a baby, not to be insulted behind somebody else's dirt. - Hey, there's a bright - side to everything. - Won't you run to - the store for me, - and get some milk and - cigarettes, please? Look, I don't mean to be mean. - I told you... I gotta go - see Soldier's mother. But it's just around the corner. Hello, Pierce. There's something I had to tell you, but I forgot. I guess it wasn't that important then, huh? Do you, uh... do you... Do... do I what? Never mind. I'll ask you later when my mind is better, because I forgot. You not gonna say goodbye? Bye. Come in. Hello, Mrs. Richards. You think Soldier will ever act his age and stay out of trouble? He wrote me a letter, saying, when he got outta jail this time, he said, he ain't going back. - He even asked me to - look for him a job. Mrs. Richards, you know, Soldier may get into trouble, but he's never done anything that was evil or vicious. I mean, he's never sold dope. He ain't nothing like these kids walking the streets today. And, well, if you look at it, Soldier and I are pretty much alike. You and your brother never got into trouble. And your brother's getting married. Yeah. He's getting married. He's marrying a girl whose parents got a lot of money. Old man's a doctor. She just don't seem real. I mean, she's always talking about how lucky she was when she was a kid. Fish and hunting... You're his best friend, and if you can influence him to do the right thing and stay out of trouble, if you do that for me, I will forever be in your debt. You don't have to worry, Mrs. Richards, I promise you, I'll do whatever I can to keep him outta trouble. Hello, Pierce. Pierce, be sure to mark in all the specials and keep them separate. - And then mark in the rest - of the clothes so we can get - started the first - thing in the morning. Yes, sir. - See what your mother - can do with those. Tell her those are my church-going trousers, - and I have to have - those back right away. Mom. Yeah, son? Mr. Bitterfield is in. Wants you to fix these. Just tell him we'll fix them and just throw them in the trash. When he comes back, we'll tell him they got lost, and we'll give him a pair of those unclaimed pants. Yes, sir. Why don't you, um... come back tomorrow? My boy... you don't mind me calling you "boy," do you? Young people seem to thing an old person has to say. But, my boy, I got a piece of good advice for you. You marry someone just like your mother. She works miracles. Pierce, have you ever had your hands on my prayer book? Here it is. When you get old, everything happens to your memory. - Hey, you got me, - but let me show you. Oh, both of you, act your age. - You're too old to - be carrying on so. Can I help you? I'm looking for work. - I was wondering, maybe, - if you might have some work you need done here. I'm sorry, but there's no work here. I've got two grown men out back to do everything. Yes, well, uh... thank you anyway. Sure. I got two grown men acting a fool. Son, never underestimate an old man. Forgot your hat. You ought not to do your father's hat like that. Now, darling, I proved I really love you. And I've always been real true. But I can't believe you anymore. You promised me... - That was your - brother on the phone. He's coming by and bringing his sweet, little girlfriend. That sweetness you call is about as fake as a $3 bill. - Don't you act ugly in - front of her tonight, and don't say one word out of place. Don't worry. I don't have to be there. - You be there, because - I want her to see that you can be civilized. - And what do you have - against her anyways? 'Cause she's bragging all the time, how she's had this, and she's had that, how she's been spoon-fed all her life, living way up on Sugar Hill, and bragging that her daddy's a big whatchamajig. Wendell oughta marry somebody he knows, come around here. I thought you had some kind of sense, but now, I don't know. - Help me with these - clothes, damn it. You have to go over to Big Mama's and Big Daddy's, - and see if they need - anything, and pick up my pot from Aunt Hattie. Where my mother's pot? I know you have better manners than that, walking in here without speaking. You act like you own the place. I'm sorry. I... guess I was kind of in a rush. - That's no excuse - for bad manners. Well, I was trying to hurry home before Wendell came. Do you want a bag, honey? No. Thanks. How you, Big Mama? I'm just hanging on, son, hanging on. I wish I could stay. I gotta run. How are you doing, Mr. Monday? You know, I always wanted girls, but the Lord gave me boys. Well, I guess you have to be satisfied with what you got. Bet you have a lot to be thankful for. Why, no, Pierce. I used to have a lot of things to worry about. I had to worry about my grades, whether people like me, and, oh... I have two older brothers. I had to compete with them too. Tell me. They teach you how to pick cotton in charm school? Why, no, Pierce. Charm school taught young ladies how to be ladies and how to be charming in the presence of gentlemen. And did you know that a man's worth and measure was once determined by the amount of cotton that he chopped in a day? And how much cotton have you chopped, Pierce? Has Pierce been giving you any more of his mess? Why, no. - I was just telling Pierce that - if it wasn't for his brother, I'd be marrying him. Is my brother trying to steal my girl already? My secretary's typing up a list of names, - so if there's anyone you wish - to add for the reception, call her. When are you going to have a secretary? - I'm sure as soon - as Pierce makes up his mind as to what he's going to be, he's going to be quite successful. I got them in church. If I could only live to see them settle down and raise a family, I will have done my job, and the Lord can call me onto glory. I've got just this one between me and a full life. - Don't blame me - for your problems. Who else am I to blame? You ungrateful thing. - If it weren't for - me and your papa making all those sacrifices, trying to give you the best we could. - You just as thankless - as you can be. I'm not thankless. - You shouldn't be talking - about the best man like that. Pierce, you oughta say goodbye to them before they go. You all right? Is Pierce retarded? Just ghettoized. Give us this day... our daily bread? Pierce. Up front, please. Yes. - He can't remember what - name he used on the ticket. You can't find your ticket? No. I don't know where it is. See, I think two wee... two months ago, I put some clothes in, coulda used the name of Bob Walter. - Why'd you wait so long - to pick your clothes up? Just got the money. Hm. I don't see it. Uh, the last time, you used the name of Jack Ace. Look under the name of Corn. You picked those up already. I don't know why we have to keep track of all your aliases and whatnot. - People wouldn't have to change - their name if they weren't up to some kind of dirt. - Well, lady, I'm tired - of coming in here, and you giving me trouble. - Well, do you know - what they look like? I believe I do. Come here. - Let me know when - you find it, huh? Mm-hmm. Tommy. How are you, Pierce? Where you going, all dressed up? Who, me? All dressed up? This is just some things I threw on. You notice anything different about me? Nope. I arched my eyebrows. You ever buy shoes that you didn't like? These make my legs look different. You ever been to a prom? Well, in a couple of years, I'll have my prom. I was thinking, if you weren't busy... they're young anyway. These could be them, I'm not sure. I remember what I was saying. I'd like for you to take me to the prom. - That's if I don't - have stomach cramps. Well, I'm going to see Smokey Robinson tonight, and I better go get dressed up. Pierce, you've got to go around to Big - Daddy's 'cause Hattie - wants to go out tonight and be with the people. - Ain't no telling what - time she'll return. Please don't start that mess. But, darling, this I must tell you, as I walk, dear, from your door, you'll never be worried anymore. I'm counting the days. I promise you that when Soldier gets outta jail, this time, he ain't going back. How you doing? Uh, could you do me a favor? Sure, whatever. Could you give Soldier a job? If you wanted a job, yeah. But Soldier? No, Lord. I'm sorry. Soldier, no. Thanks. Hey, Bob, I was wondering if you can do me a favor. Yeah, Pierce, anything. Good. - You know Soldier's - getting outta jail, right? That's too bad. That's one fella they should keep in jail till he rot. Yeah, Pierce, what was that you wanted to ask me? Uh, nothing, really. Hey, man. What time'd your bus get in? Man, my bus got here a half hour ago. Man, I had to catch the bus. You wouldn't believe it. What happened to your car? - Somebody put some sugar - in the gas tank, man. Motor problems. Who was it? Nah, it's good, man. Let's go. Let's go this way. What are you doing, crying? I'm coming to stay. My girl starts to cry when I come home. Ain't that something? I'm coming to stay. Finish eating your food. Who's your girlfriend now? Who is it? It's... it's Walter. Who do you say you are? Yes, good evening. Uh... is Pierce in? Uh, tell him we're out in the car. Thank you very much. Good evening. - That was some of - your friends outside. You see what your friend did? Look at his face, look at it. Your friend is sick, sick. - And you tell him - I'm looking for him. I'm looking for him, kill him. What do you want me to do? What did you do to him? What are you hitting me for? We're just holding a friendly conversation. Look, we just come by here to let you know, to tell you, so that you could tell your friend, before somebody shoots his ass. What's the matter? Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. OK, don't cry. There we go. There we go. Yeah. OK, all right. Is Soldier managing to stay out of trouble these days? I, uh... haven't seen him do anything. Every time I hear, you got a different woman. Hey, you know me, I gotta have a different woman every time. Hey, come on, help me out here. Hey, hey. Come with me, darling. Come with me. Hey, man. What happened to Lanell? Who? Lanell. - He was killed - robbing a liquor store. Where is everybody? It's you and me. It's you and me. My stomach hurt. It's no fun being a woman. I went to see Smokey Robinson last night. Oh. - Do you think Billie - Jean Williams is pretty? I don't like men that are too cute. Yes, my darling? You have clothes to pick up? Why, I would think you'd be home, watching "Howdy Doody." You ready for your bath? Oh, got to go pee first. Why don't you raise up the toilet seat before you pee down it? Who? You. Them boys did that. What boys? You and Wendell. - Y'all don't even - clean up your room. I can't get you come out and cut the grass. Big Mama. Hm? - What's that blue - stuff in your hair? My... my hair? Oh. My hairdresser. She do what she wants to do with my hair. I don't have nothing to say about how I look. - I wouldn't trust you - to give me a shave. I'll give you two bits if you shine my shoes. Will you take these house shoes off and put these on? - You don't wanna - wear those right now. Why can't I? Your feet are swollen. Which reminds me, it's time for you guys' medicine. Can I help you? Yeah, I, uh... left some clothes here I gotta pick up. Well, do you have a ticket? No, I, uh... I lost it. I dropped it someplace. You two together? If you got something to do, don't keep waiting. I... I think we got the wrong cleaners, man. What happened? Man. She had us covered, man. Bullshit. - Hey, girl, don't you - talk to me like that. Say, punk, give me the gun. Who you calling punk? Hey, give me the gun, man. Give me... I said be quiet. Don't hurt my baby. Hey, man, you ever get in Barbara's drawers? Nah. It's OK for Sheila to cheat on her husband to be with you. But it ain't OK for you to cheat on Sheila to... man, you are weird. Hey. Man. Pierce. Pierce, have you seen him? Got a letter from Boise. He's got the neuralgia. Been to the doctor, and he can't work. - Well, I guess that - means he wants me to send him some money. He's got those great, big, old, grown boys there. Why don't they find a job? - The Christian - thing to do is always to help those that are in need. If they need cotton, like they did when I was growing up, there would be jobs for everybody. And these people who are always in trouble and on dope, you put them out there in some Mississippi cotton field in the hot sun, and make them pick 500 pounds of cotton a day, and work their ass off like a Georgia mule. That's the way old folks talk. The old people used to try to tell us, boy, you better mind how you walk. There's trouble ahead of you, and your days are numbered. I saw the wedding dress today. It was so beautiful. It's the prettiest dress I ever seen in my life. I wish I could live parts of my life over. Pierce, please don't embarrass me tonight. I don't feel like going. After this wedding, you can do whatever you wish. But I'm gonna tell you this one thing... her family was nice enough to invite us to dinner, and you, young man, are going to show your respect. I didn't raise any heathens. - You gonna be at your - brother's side at his wedding, and those are the only two facts in life I know right now. I don't like those people. - What on Earth do - you have against them? - I just don't - like those people. Oh, you must have some reason. I can like and dislike who I please. She parks her expensive car outside, people gonna think we have money, and break in here and rob us. She walks around here signifying. I don't like people who've had it easy all their lives, never had any worries. Son, will you let me take you to see Dr. Jackson and let him take a look at you? I know there's only one God, one Father, one divine power. That power is with us now. I thank you, Father, for this food and for these new relationships. And so it is. Amen. Is something wrong with the wine, Mr. Mundy? I would've liked to have something stronger, something like Old Grand-Dad. Wine's fine. He don't need nothing else. Well, now, if you would like something else, whatever it is, I can get it. He's fine. I wished I was in your shoes. Pierce, are you feeling all right? Pierce, what sort of work do you do? I went to school to be a heavy equipment operator. - Nobody told me that - everybody was going to school to be the same thing. I drove a semitruck until the strike. I was a brakeman at the railroad. I drove explosives and all sorts of dangerous material. Mother, will you pass me the cheese, please? How come you didn't want to be a lawyer like your brother? I don't have the smarts for that kind of thing. - You see, I like - working with my hands. What is this salad made of? Ah, Maria, what's in the... oh... Or whatever you call it. - I think what she's - saying that what you think is an apple is a potato. Thank you. Thank you. Are you finished? Thank you. - I'm glad you - don't have to crack these things with your teeth. - It would have been - heavenly if one of my sons could have been a lawyer and the other a doctor like your two children. Doctors and lawyers, biggest crooks in the world. Getting full as ticks off other people's blood. No. I wouldn't go as far as to call all doctors crooks. Lawyers and mechanics, they have you where the wool is tight. Young man, if you're looking for real corruption, look at politics. All I know is, the higher up you go, the lower the people you find. That's a nice paradox. - You'll have to - excuse my dear brother. He has a very romantic view of the have-nots. Sonia, how did your trial turn out? We won. Tell us how you did it. Well, the prosecution was in a hurry to present his case. It seems that his wife was in the hospital giving birth, so it was back and forth to the hospital. Anyway, the judge was retiring right after this case, so he couldn't have been happier for a short trial. So I kind of let my client know that any delays would be in his best interests. The next thing I know, he came down with stomach pains and couldn't even walk. The moment we got into court, the prosecuting attorney threw the case to the jury... - Somebody should've - taken a baseball bat - and went to town - upside his head. Hush. - When you're fighting - for a man's life, you get to know him as a person. What about the dead girl? Excuse me. I'll be right back. Excuse me for a minute. This has been a very interesting evening. Yes, it has been. I've enjoyed you all. We're so glad that you invited us. We had a lovely evening. Thank you so much. Pierce, come on, sweetheart, let's go. Thanks. Pleasure. It was a pleasure. Yes, just wonderful. All right, good night now. Thanks very much. - All right, all - right, good night. Did someone say anything? I didn't hear nothing. You really showed your ass tonight. You acted so ugly. I was so ashamed. You need to be locked up somewheres. You want me to hold him while you hit him? - Today must be - my lucky day, huh? What do you mean? - I mean three pregnant women - in a row coming in here, one right after another. Must signify something, huh? How old are you? I'm 30. - 30, and you're - not married yet? Nope. So what are you waiting on? - Soon as I can find me a - woman who has a 9:00 to 5:00, who can cook, and bring home all the money, baby. Give me my clothes. - I don't have time - to waste on fools. Say, lady, your son has got a serious problem. I wish that was all he had. - Everybody knows - what you been doing. What's happening? Ain't nothing. I hear you. You see this, don't you? How you doing, Mrs. Mundy? Soldier, you been outta jail all this time - and just now coming - around to say something? Oh, I've been doing fine. I've been real busy, looking for a job. - Oh, hell, I haven't got - time to talk about you and your bad manners now. I'm late for prayer meeting. - So how long's - she gonna be gone? - Well, it'll be a - couple hours before they get to hoopin' and hollerin' out there. Hm. Do me a favor. Anything. Um, I wanna show her something in private. Your friend is sick. Baby. Come on. Let's go to a motel. I'll pay for it. No. Listen, I ain't got time now. My jones is too heavy. Don't be such an animal. Pierce, come here for a minute. There you are, buddy. - Bring me a big, - tall glass of water. Yeah, it's cool. Oh, all right. Thanks. What is this? Pierce. Pierce, my baby got a headache. Bring me an aspirin. - And... and, uh... bring - some more water. I be right back. Won't take me but five minutes. Pastor Isaiah's always saying we can't remember nothing. Oh my... Soldier, what... My goodness, Soldier! What are you doing? Hey. Get your butt here. Hey, wait a minute. Go on, you've done enough damage to your mother. Come on. Come on. I swear to God... Hey, uh... I'm really sorry, OK? Oh, hey, Angela. Would you do me a favor? - Would you go around - the corner and tell Pierce I'm waiting for him? - What else have you - got in your pocket? - Oh, I ain't got - nothing in my pocket. But listen here, I'm ready to go, you know? - I'm getting tired of - waiting on Pierce. - Besides, you know, I was - thinking, where we going, we ain't gonna need three. Oh, really? Really. - Are you gonna run around and - tell Pierce that that Soldier boy wants him? I ain't nobody's messenger boy. What are you doing? - Showing her how - to swallow them. Thank you. Where is her? She's in the room. She got company? Nah. Boy, would you be upset if I asked you to turn off that TV? It play all day. It's the devil's work. What? That TV. Do you ever asked any of your friends whether they were saved or not? No. Your friend Soldier, does he have religion? - Why do you wanna - know what Soldier say? He just ran across my mind. You got time to read to us? Any place? 26 Psalms. "Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity. I have trusted also in the Lord, therefore, I shall not slide. I have hated the congregation of the evil doers and will not sit with wicked. Gather not mine soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men. As for me, I will walk in mine integrity." Go on. "The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? If I ascended up into heaven, Thou art there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there. If say, surely, the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me. But the night shineth like the day, and the darkness and the night are both light to Thee." Jared, wake up. Come on, wake up, Jared. Son, wake up. Wait. He's my baby. Wait, Jared. Hey, hey, calm down now. Calm down. Calm down, calm down. Easy goes. Easy. 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's check him. We still haven't got anything. Let's go again. 2. Let's check him again. I don't believe we have anything. Wrap him up. Have you seen Pierce? No. Tell me about the party the other night, man. - OK, this... this - chick came up to me. - I guess she been liking - me for a long time. But, you know, I'm... I'm a... Soldier. Soldier is dead. Soldier is dead! Your friend? Oh, wow, man. Hello, Operator? I'd like to make an emergency call to Natchez, Mississippi, please. The numbers is 295-8396. Thank you, Operator. Hello, who's this? Hello, Auntie? Soldier's dead. Well, she's taking it a lot better than I expected. Yes. Um... yes, I'll call you. - I think it will - be this Saturday. Yes. God take care of you too. "If ought but death part me." I do declare, you've been like a son. I'll see my boy again, for we will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. You know, death comes in twos and threes. I'm sorry, but, uh... viewing hours are over, OK? Pierce. I heard the bad news, but those things happen. This is nice. You got to be kidding. Is this apartment for rent? Yeah, but it's cheaper to live in Beverly Hills. - You know, - I came by to see if you could be a pallbearer. I ain't got nothing else to do. Come in. The door's open. How y'all doing? Say, I heard about your buddy. Jean, you better be still. OK, baby. I was wondering if you could be a pallbearer. See, we've been working seven days a week, 11-hour shifts. If my mother died today, I couldn't leave work. So I'm sorry. Daddy, Pierce is at the door. Tell him to come in, sugar. Come in, Pierce. Hey. Hey. Just in time for supper. No, I wish I could, but my stomach's been bothering me lately. Thanks anyway. Don't be like that. The kids ate. - I'm just gonna fix - you a small plate. Just eat a little. I thought we'd eat like white folks tonight. You, um... do you think you could be a pallbearer this Saturday? Saturday. Saturday. Hm. Ain't your brother getting married this Saturday? You missed the rehearsal! When is the wedding? Saturday? - OK, you have to change - the wedding, you see, because the funeral is Saturday. Boy, you better stop this bullshit. Excuse me, Mom. - I ain't had nothing to - do with that boy's death, - and I got plans, and it - don't include the dead. I'm getting married Saturday on time. Please. Sonia. I wanna ask a favor of you. Please! - Sonia, can you change - your wedding date? What? Or the time, even. - Either early in the morning - or... or later in the evening. Please? You wanna ask me for a favor? You've never tried to be nice to me. You've insulted my parents, me, everybody. You've never even spoken to me without being rude. And now, after all those remarks about my middle-class this and my middle-class that, you wanna ask me for a favor? I don't care anymore. Why can't you change your wedding day? You live under my roof without paying rent. And when you was out of work, I didn't say a word. And I've never asked you for a favor, but I'm calling in my debts now. You promised me you'd be best man at your brother's wedding, and I'mma holding you to it. I'll take care of this. Son, you got everybody upset. This thing has been planned for over a year now. The invitations been sent out. The honeymoon trip been planned right after. Do you understand what you're doing? You know, something might happen. Why, they might even change the funeral. You never know about these things. You know, they might just change the funeral. Ah, Pierce. Have a seat. This day is killing me, all the relatives coming in and all. Were you gonna say something? Just let me love you tonight. Forget about tomorrow. My darling, won't you hold me tight and never let me go. Dry your eyes. No tears, no sorrow. Cling to me with all your might. Oh, here I am. Oh, that looks great. You do look lovely. Oh. And this is great. - You know, I'm glad we - got this one and not - that other one, 'cause - this really looks good, especially with this gown. You're not nervous. No. We said we'd never part. But lately, I find you're a stranger in my heart. Give me the right, in summer or in spring... ... fervently kneel. Here, bring your wounded hearts, tell of your anguish. Earth hath no sorrow that heaven... Come here. Where you been? - We've been looking - all over for you. - You got to go have your picture - taken with your brother. I already had it taken. You couldn't have already had your picture taken. The cameraman just got here. - Look, I'm supposed - to be at the funeral. - You gotta find somebody - else to be the best man. Where's that ring? It's right here. I gotta go. Oh, no. You... you must be kidding. And look at your clothes. And go somewhere and comb your... you plant yourself somewhere, and don't you move until this is all over with. I don't understand this. I just don't understand. I'm sorry, everyone, but there will be a slight delay. You see, Sonia's favorite uncle is coming from out of town - for the wedding, - and my husband's going to pick him up now, and they should be here any moment. Excuse me, excuse me. Papa, I gotta go. - Can't you wait a - few minutes longer? It's going to start any time now. Just trust me. How long is it gonna take? It's not gonna take long. Trust me. Can you remember that? - Well, if you can - remember all of that, remember that God is able! God is able. Welcome. You're one of us now. It's wonderful to have you in the family. Hey, let me use your car. - My car? - Why? For what? Don't ask me for what, just give me your keys. Sure. It's around back, doesn't have much gas in it though. Can remember that, then you oughta remember God said, ah, lo, I'm with you. Yes, Lord. Always! Always! Even to the end of the Earth. If you remember when things wasn't going too well with your family, and you thought that mom and dad was gonna break up, and maybe they... Where is your son? I don't know. - My wife went out - to look for him. This is ridiculous.
