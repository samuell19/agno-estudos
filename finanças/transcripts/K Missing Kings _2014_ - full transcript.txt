TOKYO LEGAL AFFAIRS BUREAU - CIVIL REGISTRY DEPARTMENT - DIVISION 4 Seems like the request for approval hasn't been submitted yet. Blame Domyoji. I reminded him. - Let's go. - Right. Looks like it's not a false alarm! The scene is... Mihashira Tower! The Gold Clan is under attack? What the hell's going on?! Please wait for me! It's coming down hard. Yeah. I can't believe someone is foolish enough to challenge His Excellency. But that place is Gold Clan territory. Is it okay for us to get involved? we have scramble orders. Move out! Units 20 through 25, close in from the southwest side. Units 26 through 30 will take the northeast side. Surround Mihashira Tower. we have weather and GPS data via satellite. ground forces stand by for deployment. Flight leader to all units. Visibility is poor. Watch the distance between aircrafts. Our cause is pure! Emergency vehicles are passing. Please pull over to the side. Emergency vehicles are passing. Please pull over to the side. Did we get a hold of security at Mihashira Tower? Blockade in place! Hurry up and contact the local police! This is Scepter 4. Respond, please. The fleet will infiltrate on the order. Check all equipment. Have we confirmed His Excellency's whereabouts? That is top priority! Special Ops will take the Main Gate. The rest will cordon off the area. Do not allow the media in! Roger that. Wait for the captain's order to move in. Do not act on your own. Captain... We're ready to move. Please give the order. Tell them to stand by. So you've crawled out at last. Yukari! Yukari! Are you okay? Are you okay? Oh yes. Yukari is fit as a fiddle. Can't say that about those around me though. Impressive. Just what I'd expect from the famous Usagi. Douhan, you there? Detached force reporting. We've reached the underground databank and have begun work. But we need a little more time to crack through security. Keep the Usagi at bay. Will do. But to think it's taking this much time to finish what we do best. I guess the Gold Clan really is gifted. At least, they're making it more fun for me. What about your target? Not a sign of him. Since the King's not around, there's hardly any tension. I'll get rid of the Usagi. When you're finished there, Douhan, will you go and escort the princess? Understood. Did we get him?! It's so stuffy in here. What?! All right, time to finish this up. You must find your way. And overcome obstacles. Then you will reach it. And here I am. Why didn't you let me know sooner that you were both back in town? I'll sit here! Sorry. Meeting up with her took time. Kukuri! Long time no see! Long time no see, Neko! Is the reconstruction of the high school island going well? Oh yeah. It's been about a month since you guys last visited the island... Well, we've made some progress since then. It's just about back to normal. Oh, but the clock tower and that huge crater hasn't been touched. How's everything going for you two? Weren't you looking for someone? What was his name? Oh yeah, Shiro. Right? Shiro is nowhere to be found! Seriously... How far did he get blown away to? Wait, he was blown away?! It's been close to a year now. Neko and I split up to search, but we couldn't find Shiro. Shiro, where are you? Are you even alive...? Huh? Huh?! Neko, what is it? Over there! It's the girl from the Reds! Sorry, Kukuri. Can you go on ahead to the island without us? Huh? You're not coming? We'll stop by later. I promise. Better hurry, or we'll lose her. Okay, sure. - Chop, chop, Kurosuke! - Guess they're really busy. Anna! This way! This is the end of the line. Hand over the girl. Who the hell are you?! I have no reason to answer. What...?! You're with JUNGLE, the Green Clan, I gather. Well, I know that girl. If you want to continue, I'll take over here. My business does not involve having to fight you. Was that the rumored manipulation ability of the Green Clan? Long time no see, Black Dog. Now I owe you one. Have we met? Huh? Aw, come on. Rikio...Kamamoto? Can't say I blame you for not recognizing me right away. I haven't had much appetite since Mr. Mikoto passed away. Summer's over, yet I'm still skin and bones. Rikio... Hey, but don't you worry, Anna. I may be thin, but I still pack lots of power. Why is the Green Clan after you? We're clueless about what's going on... But that ninja guy showed up at my place one day, saying he had a request for Anna. Request? He wanted Anna to use her sensory powers... to "find the Silver King." What? You can do that?! You can find Shiro?! I can't right now. Is that so... Anna's powers have been unstable for a long time. She can't locate people now. But you were asked to find him. Does that mean he's alive? I don't know. why...is the Green Clan looking for Shiro? So what now...? Can't you join up with the rest of your clan? HOMRA is as good as disbanded right now. Mr. Mikoto, Mr. Totsuka, and now even Mr. Kusanagi is gone. It's a no-win situation. HOMRA's strategist? I can't divulge the details... But Mr. Kusanagi told me to guard Anna. what about that take-charge clansman? Huh? Isn't he always at the vanguard? Well... Yata is... Huh? What's going on? Hey Yata! Happy birthday! Yay! Happy birthday! Misaki, happy birthday. Oh yeah...it's my birthday. I'm too old for birthday parties. But since you're all here, thanks! Yeah! King, it's Yata's birthday. Say something. No kidding. Almost time for your 7-5-3 rite of passage? Aw, gimme a break! I'm eighteen! Mikoto, don't needle poor Yata. He had the 7-5-3 rite five years ago. Right? Not even! Make way for the birthday cake! Did you bake this Mr. Totsuka? Mr. Mikoto... Mr. Totsuka... Damn everyone for abandoning HOMRA... Even Mr. Kusanagi... Yeah, I just got here. This is some news blackout. Not a single mention of armed occupation. Thanks for letting me know, Seri. I made it in time for the direct flight. Forget it. But did my pulling strings for you reap benefits? FLY ON THE SHIZU EXPRESS Forget it. But did my pulling strings for you reap benefits? Forget it. But did my pulling strings for you reap benefits? You were away in Germany for six months doing field investigation. Coming home empty-handed isn't acceptable. Don't worry. I did my work. Can't say whether it'll be useful or not though. I wish I could've brushed up more on the jargon with the professor there. But what the heck... Still... What? we're talking about the invincible Gold King... Starting a fight is out of character for the Green Clan... At least I think so. Any unusual movements since the tower was occupied? They seem to be fiddling with the databank, but otherwise, not a peep out of them. It's a stalemate. The Gold King hasn't launched a counterattack... Judging from the situation, we should assume he's absent. So they attacked knowing this? Can't say. In any case, since we can't confirm the influence of the Slates, my captain's strategy is to lay siege without encroaching on the other king's dominion. ? And the captain How is the Blue King doing? In top form. With the Gold King in absentia, he's stepped in to deal with the situation as well as the agencies involved. Fushimi's helping him. The burden of a King's murder... Hopefully, it's all unnecessary worry. Well, this isn't the time to chat. I'll see you later. Yes. SHIZUME STATION SHIZUME STATION Thanks... SHIZUME STATION SHIZUME STATION - But are you sure about sheltering us? - Hurry, hurry! SHIZUME STATION SHIZUME STATION - I'm going in first! - we have a room... SHIZUME STATION at the high school that we use as our home base. It'll be helpful too, if you can fill in the details for us. I'm sorry. For what? About your king... I know he didn't kill Tatara. And what about you? You said your powers are unstable... Is losing the Red King the cause? No... This is different. Hey, electricity! What's going on? Watch the girl! I'm feeling all tingly! Something is coming! As one travels on. A reunion awaits them. Right for the moment. That haiku...is by Master Ichigen... It can't be! I wonder why his poems are so touching... Hi Kuroh... It's been a while, hasn't it? Have you been well? Yukari Mishakuji... Hey, who is that? Yukari Mishakuji. Former clansmen of the late Seventh King, Master Ichigen Miwa... And student in swordsmanship... I once addressed him as...my senior. S-Senior? What the hell are you doing here? Oh, wipe that scary look off your face. Aren't you happy to see me? You? Someone who pointed his blade at Master Ichigen?! Stop messing around! Oh, that was just a test of our spirit. That's the strong bond that he and I shared. You still don't understand that? Lies! When I learned of his death, I cried for the first time in a long while. I still carry those feelings with me. But now you show up to get in my way... Answer me, are you with the Green Clan...? Yes. That's why... I'm taking that girl. S-So then Shiro... Adolf K. Weismann is alive?! I dunno. That's what we want to find out... If our biggest threat to the Green Clan... is dead or alive. Kurosuke! I was quite...pleased... when I learned that we've become foes. See, I was determined to overcome our tragic destiny. But you, Kuroh... Get away from here! R-Right! Anna! what's with...this sword? And here I was looking forward to sparring with you... This isn't even fun. There's nothing to learn from you at this point! Rikio! I'm taking Anna Kushina. S-Stop! C'mon, shape up. How can you call yourself his pupil? Damn you! You can't beat me by just going through the motions. Right now, you are no match for me. Not in sword skills or frame of mind... But least of all, beauty. Oh? Mission accomplished already? And that means this lesson is over. Too bad. Anna! You're not getting away! We'll meet again, Kuroh. Next time though, be more mentally prepared. Are you okay? N-Never mind me... Save Anna... Go after them...! All right. Leave it to me! Neko, can you track them? Pretty much... This way! Y-Yata... Big trouble! Not so loud. You know how Mr. Kusanagi always nags about keeping it quiet in the bar. And where is this Mr. Kusanagi you ask? He deserted his precious bar and went off somewhere. Huh? H-Hey, what happened?! Snap out of it, will you, Yata?! There's trouble! It's Anna...! So? Where'd this pansy take Anna? The Black Dog went after them... But I haven't heard back yet. Yata... What about Fushimi...? Maybe Fushimi would know something... He has access to the Blue's information network... Is this Saruhiko? At least identify yourself. You're not on my caller ID list. Do I know you? You damn monkey... Are you trying to start a fight with me?! Fight? Fighting you right now wouldn't be any fun. Taking on someone who's not under a Sanctum's protection would be bullying. Mr. Mikoto's power is still inside me! I'll fight you anytime! No thanks. But if you insist on fighting me... Then I suggest you change clans. I'm not like you! HOMRA is the only clan for me! Yeah, and it's as good as dead! That's what you get when you rely on things like friends. Listen to me, Saruhiko. Anna's been kidnapped. According to Kamamoto, a guy from the Green Clan named Mishakuji is behind it! But we don't know where they took her. ? Do you guys have any information If you know anything ... Please! Tell me. I'm not your informant. You think I like having to ask you?! It makes me wanna throw up! But Mr. Mikoto, Mr. Totsuka... Even Mr. Kusanagi... They're all gone. I can't think of anyone else to turn to... You're the only one that's left...! You don't have anything against Anna, do you?! Shit! I was stupid to even think he'd have a heart! W-What'll we do, Yata? Huh? Saruhiko... TOKYO LEGAL AFFAIRS BUREAU - CIVIL REGISTRY DEPARTMENT DIVISION 4 TOKYO LEGAL AFFAIRS BUREAU - CIVIL REGISTRY DEPARTMENT DIVISION 4 I've identified the one from JUNGLE who attacked Mihashira Tower. TOKYO LEGAL AFFAIRS BUREAU - CIVIL REGISTRY DEPARTMENT DIVISION 4 Yukari Mishakuji. A former vassal of the previous Colorless King, Ichigen Miwa. Colorless and Green... Someone like you... who uses two colors? I'm impressed that you learned so much in such a short time. I was asked to assist on another matter. I was doing research on it and by chance, there was a connection. JUNGLE is a unique clan that has wide presence on the Internet. Through downloadable apps, they have access to unspecified numbers of clansmen. Please take a look at this. Hmm? This is...? Higher-ranking clansmen possess the Green Clan's manipulation ability. They can alter the laws of physics, and have far greater strength than the average man... In particular, this masked clansman... CAPTAIN MUNAKATA CAPTAIN MUNAKATA He's a ninja. Very interesting. CAPTAIN MUNAKATA This masked clansman uses the manipulation ability... and as you can see, he can pass through walls. As a result, the security at Mihashira Tower is meaningless. This is just like a ninja passing through walls. - This masked... - This ninja... This masked man is probably, like Mishakuji, a highly skilled man. - No, this is ninjutsu... - In any case... This is the real problem. It's the Red clansman... Or should I say, ex-Red clansman, Anna Kushina. The reason behind her kidnapping is not clear, but... It can't be for any good purpose. Anna Kushina... Suoh's memento... Something like that... I see... I now have an idea of the enemy's intention. It seems we'll have no choice but to act. What about coordination with the other agencies? Completed, sir. Good. Well then, it's time we get going. By the way, who was it that asked for your assistance? Am I obliged to tell you sir? Not at all... I trust your work. Meooow! I never expected it to be like this. Kurosuke! That flashy man from earlier is in there! Aren't we going? Wait. Let's gather more information and plan our infiltration carefully. Huh? Why?! First, there's the Blue Clan to worry about. And inside the building, the Green Clan is probably lying in wait. Only a fool would attempt to break through from the front. Outta the way, you Blue! - It's HOMRA's Yatagarasu! - Yatagarasu?! Move! A fool just went in. We have no choice! Let's go! Huh? Now you're talking! Touchdown! Let them go! Maintain the blockade! Anna! Damn lackeys! As if you can hit me! - An intruder?! - It's a HOMRA remnant! Move! Get lost! I ain't interested in small fry! - It's Yata of HOMRA! - Damn freak! Stop! You'll hit our guys! Heh! You cowards! Huh? A-A-A girl?! Oww! You?! Use your head a little. Misaki Yata. Huh? Who called you... Shit dog?! Shit dog...? Shut your...uncouth mouth! Sorry, I had a rotten upbringing! Meow! Listen to my plans! First, stop fighting, you two! Then... Then we all help each other and save Anna! Okay? Let's go! Hey! Who made you boss...! Damn, more of them! Neko! Leave it to me! Special Attack! Cat the Mountain! Meow! Hey, is that chick gonna be okay on her own? Meow-haha! Don't underestimate a Silver clansman. You...that chick... every damn one of you...! You all piss me off! Come on. Don't be like that. On a mountain pass. Accompanied by a friend. One should have no fear. What do you think?! Huh? That's creepy. What?! How dare you! Anna! Anna! You bastards! What're you doing to Anna?! Oh, what an energetic boy. We're not doing a thing. Just asking the cute little bird for a small favor. Cute little bird! What?! I'll leave the hotheaded one to you. Understood. What?! Kotosaka, you watch below, okay? Caw! Understood! Understood! And I...will put my dear Kuroh through a beautiful initiation. Enough of your rambling... Yukari Mishakuji! First, I'll teach you manners, Kuroh! Call me "Onii-sama"! Meow-haha! Kaboom! Cat goes boom! Meow-haha! Found her! Stupid cat! Stupid cat! Stupid cat! Stupid cat! Meow?! Who're you calling "stupid"?! Caww! Thunder! Caw caw! Neko Touch! Kotosaka Thunder! Meowww! Meow, meow?! Meow-hehe... Meow?! Caw?! Another enemy! Another enemy! Cawww! Still no progress, Kuroh. All you ever do is cling on to things. You'll never be able to go anywhere unless you learn how to let go. Shut up! That's right. I'm over here. I'll shut you up, once and for all! That's the spirit. I'm at a disadvantage here. Aha! Yes, Kuroh, keep it up. Oh my, after I just complimented you... There you go, dropping to your knee. Come on, on guard. Come! He's such a handful... What? You want to play tag now? How's this?! Good. Yes, yes. More, Kuroh! Still not good enough! This is how you...slash! Still think you're giving me lessons?! This brings back memories. Damn it, what a creepy guy! Misaki! Don't worry. I'm just upping the odds in his favor. Then I'll take those odds and send you to hell. Who's there?! Caw! Another enemy! Another enemy! The enemy from HOMRA...! Mr. Kusanagi...! Hey, it's been a while. Bang! How did you know we were here...? What made you decide to show up after all this time? Same reason as you. To save our princess. Show off! Glasses! Hey, Sunglasses...! It won't open! I will not let you take that girl! That's my line! With HOMRA's Number 2 here, you're... Yata, buy me some time, will ya? Huh? Hey, Mr. Kusanagi...! This is important. I'm counting on you, Yatagarasu. Well I can't let you down if you're calling me by that name! Bring it on, cosplay ninja! HOMRA's Yatagarasu is gonna destroy you! Sorry. I went all the way to Germany to investigate, hoping I could do something about this... But I was too late. Izumo... It's no use avoiding it any longer. Anna. No... The "voice" stirs the gentle memory and nostalgia inside of me The "voice" stirs the gentle memory and nostalgia inside of me Tatara...? The "voice" stirs the gentle memory and nostalgia inside of me Behind those glasses Are you not there anymore? Behind those glasses Are you not there anymore? Morning, Anna. Behind those glasses Are you not there anymore? Behind those glasses Are you not there anymore? Are you okay? Behind those glasses Are you not there anymore? Behind those glasses Are you not there anymore? You look like you're in pain. Behind those glasses Are you not there anymore? I'm okay. Those times will never return But I could not accept that truth Those times will never return But I could not accept that truth I feel like I've been having a bad dream. Those times will never return But I could not accept that truth Those times will never return But I could not accept that truth A bad dream? Those times will never return But I could not accept that truth My heart is still aching, as I doze off into a dream My heart is still aching, as I doze off into a dream Tatara, you were killed and... My heart is still aching, as I doze off into a dream My heart is still aching, as I doze off into a dream Mikoto went to avenge you and... My heart is still aching, as I doze off into a dream My heart is still aching, as I doze off into a dream Then he died too... My heart is still aching, as I doze off into a dream And everyone got separated and... I wander through the mist, searching for you And everyone got separated and... I wander through the mist, searching for you Because I still want to believe in your warmth Because I still want to believe in your warmth No, that's not right... Because I still want to believe in your warmth I became withdrawn, trying to resist the changing present I became withdrawn, trying to resist the changing present This is the dream, isn't it? I became withdrawn, trying to resist the changing present I became withdrawn, trying to resist the changing present Yes... I became withdrawn, trying to resist the changing present I became withdrawn, trying to resist the changing present I'm sorry. I became withdrawn, trying to resist the changing present "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? Anna... "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? Go talk to him. "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? Flame of Red To protect and to pass it on is my destiny Flame of Red To protect and to pass it on is my destiny Stupid Mikoto! Stupid Mikoto! I can't go back It's my destiny Stupid Mikoto! I can't go back It's my destiny I can't go back It's my destiny Yeah. I can't go back It's my destiny I can't go back It's my destiny How could you! I can't go back It's my destiny Yeah... But Mikoto... Your red is still warm. That's not my red. That's your red. Your color. Your red... My red. Can I turn this red... into a power that protects? Anna, you wouldn't let a bad dream end as a bad dream. Anna... It's no use avoiding it any longer. Anna. No... Red King. No Blood... No Bone... No Ash! You used to stare off into the distance Always having that sad look on your face It's as if you knew everything That's the kind of look you had The same color, the same loneliness They are now inside of me They will guide me The bird in my heart will spread its wings as its instinct tells it to. If there is a place Where I must fly off to The Sword of...Damocles...? Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me The Sword of...Damocles...? Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me It can't be... Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me I'M SORRY. WE HAVE ALREADY CLOSED TODAY. Our symbol... "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? That's... "I want to see you" Is it okay to put it into words? Was that...? Flame of Red To protect and to pass it on is my destiny Was that...? Flame of Red To protect and to pass it on is my destiny If there is a place Where I must fly off to Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me Awesome... Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me What the hell? Then my eyes Have accepted what's shown before me I can't go back It's my destiny I can't go back It's my destiny Power... I can't go back It's my destiny I'm overflowing with power! I'm overflowing with power! Here I come! Anna! What's happening? Looks like things are really starting to heat up! I will not lose to you! Still running away...Kuroh?! Kuroh, I'll tell you why you'll never be able to beat me. Are you still harping about that?! This sword holds my entire being. Joy... anger, sadness, happiness, fear, hesitation, shock... madness, anxiety, pride... Honor...! And...love! It's collapsing! Watch out! Deploy the shield and withdraw! Fushimi! Roger that! Go back twenty meters and put up the barricade again! But your sword is empty... You swing Ichigen Miwa's precious blade Kotowari like a mere stick. Is it any wonder then, that it's useless against my sword, which overflows with my soul? Don't give in, Kurosuke! We're going to see Shiro again, remember?! Shiro ... My sword is empty... What's the purpose for my sword...? I, Kuroh Yatogami, do solemnly swear to henceforth devote my life to serving... the First King, Adolf K. Weismann, as his clansman. I wish you would loosen up. There's no need for such ceremony for us to be friends. Let's go. What is there for me to question? I'm supposed to be empty... Both me, and this sword ... I am the clansman of the First King Adolf K. Weismann, also known as the Silver King. I am Kuroh Yatogami. This sword will never be used for my own need... This sword will open the path and guide me to my king! And...I wield it only to protect him! Now I like that expression on your face. All right then, as a vassal of the Green King, I must accept your challenge. Yukari Mishakuji... On guard. Kurosuke! That last strike of yours was quite beautiful. Yukari! Yukari! Are you satisfied, Yukari? Please return. You have done enough. The one who stands before you is no longer a clansman targeted for capture. She is the Third King, the Red King. But Nagare, I won't be satisfied unless I return with one head, at least. She's a newborn and can barely control her power. I can handle her easily. No, we achieved what we set out to do. One must know when enough is enough. Nagare...? Nagare Hisui, the Green King?! What?! This bird?! Nah, the bird is probably just a medium. Those Greens are capable of all sorts of tricks. The Red Clan's strategist is very well informed. I'm impressed. I regret that I cannot greet you in person, but how do you do, new Red King. I am Nagare Hisui, the Fifth and Green King. Please excuse me for having to leave so soon. As a gesture of my apology, allow me to send you a little birthday present. It could also be a memorial gift. So show us just how strong your luck is by managing not to die here, Kuroh. Wait! We will meet again. Damn it! They ran away! Or maybe they let us off. Anyway, let's get the hell out of here. Waaaaa... What's going on? Meow! My hair's standing up! Up there! W-What the hell?! That's supposed to be his little present? The Lightning Bolt Jutsu?! Hey, explain this! It's a jutsu... whereby he amasses power... from lower-ranking clansman to create lightning. Y-You're a woman?! Even so, the size of it is unnatural... Don't tell me he ordered this mission to others besides the infiltration team? He's going to blast us all at once? Damn! What're you rambling about? Huh?! Say, we should get out of here quickly too! It's too late...! Anna! This time I'll protect... everyone! He dissipated the Lightning Bolt Jutsu... He isn't called the Blue King for nothing... I suppose I owe him my life... I'm not so stupid as to fall for the same trick over and over. Fushimi... Ready for battle... Huh? In honor of the new Third King... Men! Present your swords! - Hidaka, ready! - Enomoto, ready! - Goto, ready! - Fuse, ready! - Domyoji, ready! - Kamo, ready! - Benzai, ready! - Akiyama, ready! Fushimi, ready. Awashima, ready! Bastards... Hey Seri. Guten morgen. Uh... T-T-Thank... Thank you for saving us. I'm sure my assistance would've been unnecessary... if you were in your best condition. However, it is a fact that Nagare Hisui, the Green King, warrants surveillance. He is a disturbing fellow. Anna! Thank goodness you're okay! You guys are way too late! Please take care of the rest. Understood. By mutual agreement of the Third and Fourth Kings, Mihashira Tower, the dominion of the Second King and the Dresden Slates are now under the supervision of Scepter 4. Fourth King, Reisi Munakata, shall be entrusted with full authority. Yes... Mikoto Suoh was slain with this. Now, now, calm down. Mr. Fushimi... It is what Mikoto wished for. I will not hate you for that. But...I don't want to thank you for it either. As it should be. It's been ages! - It's been ages! - It's been ages! Have mercy! Kurosuke, what is that? Candy? Is it hot? Or sweet? Does it taste good? It's not food. It's a parting gift from Anna Kushina. What is it? A marble? Yes. She said to keep it as a good-luck charm. It's Shiro! Shiro... Where are you now...? This person is...Shiro...? Shiro! - Shiro... - Hey, Shiro! - Can't you hear us, Shiro?! - Hey, Shiro! Shiro! ? What's the matter, Weismann I was just thinking it'll be dawn soon. And I get to have the best view from here. Aren't you used to this view? Not really. No matter how many times I saw the sun set and rise, my world has always remained still. But now, I can feel it moving again from that light. Dawn... The start of a new world... I'm relieved that my friends seem to be welcoming a new dawn too. A king who's in hiding, and unable to go to the rescue of those in need is a failure. I was the one who gave orders not to let you return... after salvaging your reconstructed body. Don't blame yourself. It was to keep me away from the Green King, wasn't it? You needn't feel badly either, Lieutenant. They know about this ship from hacking the database in Mihashira Tower. This is the end of obscurity. Everything and everyone has begun moving again. I had a feeling this would happen from the moment I saw your corpse. As the Gold King who represents destiny, I was able to understand. Things as they are...will change. Rather... ...it will end? And I will be forcing you to pick up after my mess. No, that's not true. Lieutenant, you gave shape to the dreams my sister and I once wished for. Using the Slates, you saw through so many dreams... great ones, little ones, good ones, bad ones, too many to count. That's not true either. Huh? They were the dreams the three of us shared. That is why I wanted to fulfill them. Weismann... The new world is beautiful, isn't it? Yes. The dream we once saw, had a view like this. Yes. What a waste...to close my eyes. Yes... Lieutenant... Just as you did, I will move forward until my very last breath... I won't run away this time. I will face it head on. Haven is somewhere out there Heaven is there such a place? It's all Lonely Rolling Stones Hard and Tough to Hit and Away Hell is only for the weak Soul Waver and it'll be a Knock Out That heat is Hungry by nature So let it keep on burning Listen, we only got One chance But it's better than nothing Feeling Blue It's all about our special Pride Every time Those above us look down on us It leaves us in pain and agony Different colors My color, your color In all its brilliance The future is uncertain, right? So we must tear ourselves away to make it happen With hesitation We chose to fight than to talk Clashing face to face These sad Guys "What is most important to you?" Offense is the best defense There are many colors in this world So keep on shining That tense feeling How long can you maintain it? Feeling Blue It's all about our special Pride Every time Those above us talk down to us It leaves us scared because we are weak Different colors My color, your color Glaring at each another These graceful Guys I'm gonna get you I'm gonna kick you I'm gonna get you I'm gonna kick you Listen, we only got One chance But it's better than nothing Feeling Blue It's all about our special Pride Every time those above us Look down on us It leaves us in pain and agony Different colors My color, your color In all its brilliance The future is uncertain, right? So we must tear ourselves away to make it happen With hesitation We chose to fight than to talk Standing in the frontlines These sad Guys The burden of killing a King... I shall accept that challenge.
