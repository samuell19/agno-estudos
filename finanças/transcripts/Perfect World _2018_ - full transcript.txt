When this season comes... ...I remember my first love. The senior whom I always adored. The first love which ended as I had no courage to confess. This year, when I'm 24 years old... ...once again I fall in love with Senpai. Today, are we going to have a drink with these guys? You're right. This guy is handsome. Which one? Look, this one. Ayukawa Itsuki? He's a first-class architect. How great. Ayukawa-senpai. Huh? Do you know him? He's my senior at high school. You'll join us today then, right? It's such an important gathering with our next client company. Welcome. Welcome! Nabe-san~ Hey, hey. Sorry for being late. Nice to meet you. Kawana? Seriously? You're really Kawana. Long time no see. Long time no see. What is it? Both of you know each other? Well, she's my junior at high school. How wonderful. So such thing can happen. How surprising. Well, let's have a toast then. Okay. What do you want? Same with the others. Well, just in case. There's a lot of things. My first meeting with Senpai... ...was horrible. You can only borrow 2 books. Don't be so stiff, will you? Please. At least 3, then. That's the rule. Excuse me. Yes. What's your name? Huh? Your name. I'm... Kawana. Your first name? Tsugumi. Tsugumi... Thank you, then. Wait! I'll be troubled. I'll finish them in 1 day. It's not about that. You can't bring this book out. Everyone admired him. Thank you. The books seem difficult. It's my dream to be an architect. Senpai was at the basketball club. And I, as the member of art club, began to paint a picture while imagining him. A picture of the gymnasium and sakura tree. I drew it while imagining Senpai playing basketball. Senpai was my first love. How good~ What do you mean? Look, you meet your first love again and moreover, he's so handsome. Say, do you think Ayukawa-san is free now? What the... it's not like that. But there are hearts in your eyes. It's not like that. Sorry. Wait a sec. Yosh, is it okay here? Thank you. Yosh. Will you be okay alone? I will. I didn't drink. Moreover, I want to see how Sakuragaoka looks like at this hour. I see. I'm leaving first. Thank you. Well then, thanks. Thank you. Take care. Thank you very much. So he is on a wheelchair. Yeah. But to see him in person, he's absolutely handsome. Right, Kawana? But it will be impossible for me to have a relationship with him. Well, well. You shouldn't say such things, right? Huh? Well, but... You know... Having a relationship isn't simply about feeling, right? Geez, stop it, okay? It's time to work. W... wait. "It's not like that." But I couldn't say it. Excuse me, I'm Kawana from Cranberries. Just be like usual... Senpai! Kawana. Sorry. Is that... It's the project at Sakuragaoka district. I applied a design for the civic center. He's great, right? Nabe-san, I brought you many samples... Thank you. This is done by Ayukawa's 4-members team. When I saw his early concept, I thought we could do this. How great... If we make it through the competition... ...we'll ask Cranberries to do the interior. Let's work together then. Okay. It's good that we can work together. Yes. Somehow it feels weird to have a meal with you now. It's been so long since the last time we talked at high school. That time, we were still in uniforms. How nostalgic! It's so great that you can make your dream come true, Senpai. I always thought you pursued a career in drawing. At high school, I once won a prize in an exhibition. Though that time I believed that dreams did come true... ...the reality is actually harsh. You're right. Now I'm learning interior design, so that I can make the best use of my drawing skill. Interior design. Long time no see, Ayukawa-kun. Yeah. Hold the front. Yosh, let's go. One, two. Thank you as always. Come in. Kawana. Since it's awkward not to talk about it... ...on my third year at university, I had an accident. I got hit by a car when I rode my bike. I got spinal cord injury. Because of that, I can no longer walk. But I didn't want to give up on my dream to be an architect. So I entered the company and got certification. But when there's a slight difference in level like before... ...I'll need help from others. It was often like that too when I was on the sites. There are vendors who dislike it because I'm handicapped. That's why... ...I was so happy when they entrusted the Sakuragaoka competition to me. I want to make it successful for sure. I really like this job. I wonder if it's too flashy. You're right. Kawana. Please contact Nabe-san about the additional colors. Okay, I will phone him. Thank you. I leave it to you then. Okay. Excuse me for a while. This is Kawana from Cranberries. Kawana-san, it's me, Watanabe. Sorry, but now Ayukawa is... I leave for a while. Okay. Um... please wait outside. I'm sorry. You must be surprised. Yes. You know, as his spinal cord is injured... ...his sense becomes numb. So... without him realizing it... ...his wound got worse and he had a high fever. The deadline is getting near, so I guess he forced himself. Without him, we won't have any design perspective to submit tomorrow. So we plan to submit it without the perspective. Maybe we won't be selected because of that, though. Excuse me. Senpai. Excuse me. Ayukawa-san? What are you doing? I have to finish this. But your fever isn't going down yet. This is absurd. Please just let me draw. Without this, everyone's hard work will be in vain. But for now, you need to rest. I was so happy when they entrusted the Sakuragaoka competition to me. I want to make it successful for sure. Um... Please, I beg you too. Please let him draw. I will attend to him as well. I won't let him force himself. Please. Though he has such high fever, Senpai keeps drawing. I want to be his strength, even just a little bit. Senpai, please, don't force yourself any further. It's enough. You can work harder next time, right? 'Next time' is no good! I don't even now if there is 'next time' for me... So I have to do this now. Up till now, I wonder how many times... ...Senpai has to deal with such frustrations. How much he struggled these times. Or how much he suffered. Can you let me do this? I want to finish the coloring. Perhaps it won't turn out to be good though... But it's impossible, right? If I mess up with the coloring... I... ...went to that exhibition. The picture of the gymnasium and the sakura tree. I can remember it so vividly even now. I'm sure you won't mess the coloring. I... ...liked your drawing. Here. The last time I saw you painted was back in high school. So you saw me? It's because you always painted under that sakura tree. Actually that picture... What? Well, it's a secret. The time I spent with Senpai was truly precious. I keep drawing while forgetting about the time. I'm so happy to be able to put the colors on Senpai's thoughts. It's done. When I met my first love again, he was sitting on the wheelchair. But... ...the feelings I didn't tell him that time are overflowing. Your design for the competition was brilliant, Ayukawa-san. I can't understand why it only got honorable mention. I think so too. Well, though we didn't win this time... ...but thanks to that, we can work together with your company. So we are thankful. We feel so too. We have high hopes on your company. Let's work hard together. The young team really works hard. How to say it, the concept is brilliant, right? Since we begin to work together... ...we can go out together on our days-off now. I was happy. If my high school self knew about this, what would she think? How cute. Excuse me, can you move aside? Sorry, but it's dangerous to play there. Um, excuse me... Hey, it's not a place to play! Move aside! Come on. I'm sorry. What's wrong with that guy? Thank you for accompanying me today. I wanted to come here. I'm okay with that though... ...but it's troublesome to go out with me, right? You should get a boyfriend soon and go out with him instead. You too, Senpai. You said that you wouldn't have any relationship anymore. Are you serious about that? Yeah. Practically, it's tough. I already broke up with the girl I dated back in the high school too. You didn't watch it? No, I didn't. But it's been everyone's topic. Really? Yeah, really. Could it be... Miki-senpai? You remember it well. I do. But... ...isn't she a type of person who will overcome any hardships together wtih you? But... ...I wet my pants occasionally. Wet your pants? But if you really like someone, it's okay though he wets his pants, right? Kawana, your voice is too loud. They said it's an excretory disorder so it can't be helped. But to have to deal with it your whole life... ...you don't need to expressly choose me. "Ritsumeiyou Senior High School, Nagano Prefecture" "31st - 35th year, Tokyo Region Reunion" Somehow I'm nervous. I'm glad I can come here with you. My friend at the basketball club was in charge, so he was nagging me to come. So many people. Is he here too? I wonder. Ayukawa. Long time no see. Thanks for coming. How's your work recently? As always, Senpai is so popular. Somehow I'm happy about that. Tsugumi. Tsugumi. Long time no see. You become so pretty now. Really? Thank you. Sorry, my bad, my bad. Let's talk again later. Yeah. Later, okay? Let's go there, then. Is it Takanashi-sensei? You're right. Let's go there. It's Miki-senpai. Kawana. Long time no see. Could it be that you are the 'little monkey'? Hey, that's rude. Sorry, sorry. So you're in Tokyo now, Koreda-kun. Yeah. I'm a system engineer now. Really? That's wonderful. You're in Tokyo too? Yeah, since 5 years ago. Kawana. I'm going outside for a while. Okay. It is... ...Ayukawa-senpai, right? Hey, hey, haven't they broken up already? He got an accident. I see. Could it be that you're dating him now? No, we just work together. Sometimes we go out for meal. I see. Today... ...if we meet, I thought of telling you something, Itsuki. I... ...will get married. Are you relieved? Not particularly. It has nothing to do with me. You're right. Itsuki. You also have the right to be happy. Take care of yourself. Miki-senpai. You are... the one in the library... I'm Kawana. I remember you. Because you got along well with Itsuki. Um... ...about your marriage... Sorry, I happened to hear it before. Do you think I'm a cruel woman? No, I don't... Congratulations. It's okay. Everyone thinks I dumped Itsuki. But actually... ...I was the one who got dumped. He thrust me away... ...but that's his kindness. To see his attitude before, I understand that it was for my sake. As expected, I shouldn't have come. Senpai, don't you actually have something you want to tell Miki-senpai? So you can drive, Kawana. As long as there's navigation system and back monitor. Don't say "as long as". But it's like that. Somehow it's scary. How rude. You should say "we'll be fine" or so. Where is this place you want to go to? It's a secret. Secret, huh~ Yes. This is... This is where Miki-senpai holds the ceremony. Let's go home. We'll get off here. Don't do something unnecessary. Senpai, you can't stay like this. Please congratulate her properly. Not only for Miki-senpai's sake... ...but also for yourself. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. I'm glad... I'm glad she could be happy. If the accident didn't happen... ...Senpai would be... Kawana. Thank you for taking me here. Go, go, go! Nice shoot. Aim at it, aim at it. Come on, come on. Go, go, go! Itsuki. Great! What's the matter? Don't you hear it? Hmm? Sound of a cat. So you are abandoned? Yosh. Until you find someone who wants to take care of you, what about staying at my place? It replies me. You're so kind, Senpai. Well, if it's just something like this, I can do that. Senpai. So it's Nabe-san? I've told him not to tell you, though. I'm okay. It's just a slight fever. Therefore I was hospitalized for further examitaion. I will be discharged tomorrow. Glad to hear that. Oh my. A guest? Kawana, this is my mother. I'm Kawana Tsugumi. Um... I was his junior at high school. From Matsumoto? Yes! Then, what about having this together? Futabado's castella. How nostalgic! I really like this. Wait a moment, okay? I will cut this. Let me do that. No, no, it's okay. No, let me do it. Really? Okay then. Okay. She's a good person, isn't she? She's my junior at high school. Itsuki. Why don't you come back to our hometown? You can find a job too there. If you live nearby, I can feel at ease. Mom. I've continued living while giving up on so many things. If I'm given a chance, I won't give up for sure. Even though I have to force myself, I don't want to have any regrets. I'm still regretting even now. Letting you live alone like this... If something bad happens... She'll get troubled too, right? We aren't like what you think. Then what's your relationship with her? Kawana. I'm sorry. Just take your time. Okay. Here's the castella. Kawana. It might be my misunderstanding though... ...but if you have any feelings for me... ...I can't respond to your feeling. Senpai? Since I broke up with Miki... ...I've decided to live myself alone. And because I have such resolution... ...I desperately works hard in my job. If someone spoils me now... ...I feel like I would stop working hard. A man like that can't make you happy, Kawana. It's been 6 years since Itsuki got that accident. At first, without tossing away the hope to walk again... ...he worked so hard in rehabilitation. But then, when he came to understand about his condition.. ...he completely changed. He behaved as if he could accept it... ...calmly. But he became so harsh to himself. Speaking about wheelchair... ...what seems tough is always about him being unable to walk. But actually, the scariest thing is that... ...he could lose his life to due to the complications. It's not that everyone can lose their life due to complications though. But... To be together with him who has such a risk... ...is a difficult thing. But for me... ...even though it means to burden others... ...I want him... ...to be happy. After 5 years. After 10 years. You can't be sure that your precious one will still be there. I thought of saying the important things... ...and telling Senpai properly. Senpai! What are you doing? You're just discharged from the hospital. You too, why are you here? I have something to tell you. Sorry but I'm looking for my cat now. Did it go missing? Yeah. Moreover it's raining now. I will look for it, so please go home, Senpai. Kawana, you'll get soaked. You don't have to worry about me. How can I not worry about you? Why are you always like that? Please stop treating my feelings so lightly like that! Why are you angry like that? Saying that I won't be happy if I'm with you... ...just don't decide things on your own like that! Please stop concluding things by yourself! Kawana. No one can ever replace you, Senpai. I am... ...worried about your condition. If you got sick... ...and therefore passed away, what should I do? I like you, Senpai. Can I open this? Here it is. Seriously? So you are here, Kenzo. You were missing. Thank God~ Sorry. I made you worried. I might not be reliable though... ...but... ...but I want you to just tell me anything. I will accept anything. Kawana. Look this way. So fast. How beautiful. Before, my parents used to take me here. It's actually more beautiful up there though. It's totally okay. Here is enough for me. Kawana. Here. Open it. It's to commemorate... ...that we start dating. Kawana? Actually, I'm a bit worried. I wondered if you forced yourself to go out with me... ...because you were kind and couldn't thrust me away. That's why I'm happy. Senpai. Thank you for letting me be your girlfriend. Me too. Thank you. It's cute. Looks good on you. The last time I went back home was this January, I guess. Me too. When I said that I was wavering because the train got crowded in Obon festival... ...I got scolded by my parents. That's why you took advantage of a ride on my car. How rude of you to put it like that. We take turns on driving. Yeah, yeah. By the way, is your kitten okay? After I consulted to Nagasawa-san about that, I keep it as my pet. Nagasawa-san is... your helper, right? I haven't met her, by the way. What kind of person is she? She was previously a nurse. She took care of me right after I got that accident. She also took care of me after the rehabilitation. So I owe her a lot. I see. Thank you. Is it okay here? My house is nearby. Tsugumi. Dad. Well then, I'll contact you later. Thank you. Tsugumi. So you came here by car? Recently, I get to work together with my senior at high school by chance. What is his job? He's a first-class architect. He works for a design firm. Wow, isn't it great? What is his name? Ayukawa Itsuki-san. We are dating now. I see. Introduce him to us, then. Next time, okay? Let's eat. Dad. It's okay since he's someone with proper job, right? Well, I don't say anything. Let's eat. Also... ...he is on a wheelchair. Wheelchair? He injured his spinal cord in a traffic accident, so he is handicapped. But though he can't walk, he can do his daily routines and job properly. Can it be healed? No, it can't. Huh... But... ...he's a strong and gentle person. I respect him. Dad. Dad is getting older too, so his body is getting weaker. He's worried about your future. Kawana. Did your father say something? Huh? The other day, I didn't get off from my car. I just wonder if it made him feel offended. Did you talk to him about us? I did. Next time, I will properly give my greetings to them. Let's go. Senpai understands. That my parents might have told me various things. That I'm getting worried. He carries it all on his back. What's wrong? Nothing. There are still so many things we have to overcome. But if I'm with Senpai, I'm sure I'll be okay. I can face it with smile. Welcome home. Nagasawa-san, so you're coming. Sorry for entering on my own. I thought of going home after I put your medicine, but I did a little cleaning too. Thank you as always. This is my helper, Nagasawa-san. Nagasawa-san, she is Kawana Tsugumi. Nice to meet you, I'm Kawana. I'm Nagasawa. Please be attentive to details while doing laundry or washing... Okay. For the cleaning, dust will easily pile up on spots which are hard to reach, so please mind that. Okay. Also, make sure you don't forget to put the wet cloth before the entrance. Okay. I've bought the usual stuffs and I've put them in the fridge. Thank you very much. Are you from the same town as Itsuki-kun? Yes. We met again by chance at work. So you didn't know about him being on the wheelchair? Yes. I see. I'm sorry. Are you okay, Kawana? Yeah. Senpai, your foot! Don't move. I did it again. Kawana-san. I've... ...always seen him struggling in pain. In order to understand both his heart and his body. That's why, let me tell you this. To be together with him, you have to prepare yourself. Thank you for expressly coming here. Don't mention it. To build a house... ...I want to ask Ayukawa-kun. I've discussed this with my wife too. Thank you very much. Our Kawana will be in charge for the interior. We look forward to work with you. Thank you, Tsugumi-chan. Yes, me too. I want to be the strength for Senpai. I have to work harder. Sorry for being late. It's okay. Thank you for today too. Kawana, don't force yourself. I'm totally okay. Rather than asking Nagasawa-san... ...you can save some cost if I can do her part as your helper. It's true though... I want to eat together with you. Are you in the middle of working? The deadline is near. Don't mind me, please continue your work. Okay. Hello. Kawana? It's me, Koreda. It looks delicious. Yeah. Don't you want to order anything else? Pasta, maybe. Sorry, but I have to go soon. Sorry, so you have a plan already? I have to go to Ayukawa-senpai's place. Huh? So you're really dating him. I see. Could it be that you go there everyday? I want to understand him more. So I think that I have to work harder. But, is love something you have to work so hard like that? Hello. Finally you pick up. You didn't contact me at all. Are you doing well? Sorry, I was busy with works. Where are you now? Going home from work. It's so late, Tsugumi. Well... it's about Ayukawa-san. Are you still dating him? Don't worry, I'll be okay. Saying you're okay like that... Dad is worried too... Sorry. Um... I got a call from my workplace, so I'll call you later. This is the plan for Yoshioka-san's house... What's this? Can you do something with the width? Okay. This will be troubling. You're right. Barrier-free. Since we want to talk properly to you about Ayukawa-san... ...please come home once. Dad is worried too. Why can't everyone understand? I just want to support Senpai. I just want to be together with Senpai. I've discussed it with Nabe-san. We've generally decided about the orientation for Yoshioka-san's house. We won't make it completely barrier-free... ...and for things he still can handle while on wheelchair, we will leave the space as it is. Kawana? The train is arriving, please be careful. Please stand behind the yellow line. I have to call the station attendant. Kawana... Kawana! Anyone! Please help! Please! Kawana! Kawana! Kawana! "For ambulance only" "Entrance" Koreda. Thank you for today. You're really helpful. To overwork herself like this... ...I can't understand it. Isn't Kawana forcing herself to keep up with you? Kawana. Tsugumi. Mom. Tsugumi. Are you okay? Thank God... Ayukawa-san. What is this? Why did this happen?! Mom, this has nothing to do with Senpai. I was with her but I couldn't do anything, so it's my responsibility. To let this thing happened... ...I deeply apologize. Ayukawa-kun. Sorry, but can you please leave us alone? Okay. Excuse me. Thank you. It's tough, huh? I just got a call from Cranberries. Shimizu-san will take over as Kawana's substitute. I deeply apologize. You don't need to apologize. Ayukawa-kun. Since she was little... ...Tsugumi was a spoiled child. She's not very skillful. As the youngest child... ...everyone spoiled her and raised her with lots of love. Though she's honest, she also has weak sides too. That's why... ...I don't think she is strong enough... ...to carry the burden while being with you. Ayukawa-san. I beg you. Please break up with my daughter. It also hurts me to say such things. I know that what you have to go through is really hard. I really think so. But as expected... ...I don't want my daughter to live a difficult life. Please... ...raise your head. Please raise your head. Senpai! I will proceed to the examination room. Okay. So you're coming. Are you okay? Say, Senpai. Now we have same height. Senpai? Kawana. When you're discharged, let's go somewhere together. I really look forward for today. To go to amusement park with Senpai is... like a dream for me. You're exaggerating, Kawana. I want to eat that. "Mr. Bear's Castella" You really like ice cream, huh, Kawana? Yeah, I like it. Senpai. Thank you for today. Recently, I often had this dream. Dream? In my dream... ...I was able to stand on my both feet... ...and I could go up to the high place which I can't reach with wheelchair. Together, we watch the scenery from the top. I often had a dream about me walking right after the accident. But I didn't have it recently. Being with you is so fun... ...so I start to imagine that because I feel so happy. The things which I could do if only I could walk. The scenery... ...we could see together if only I could walk. Senpai? Kawana. Thank you for today. You give me the best memories. Let's come here again. Okay? The picture of sakura tree you painted... ...I want to see it once again. I want to go back to that time. If only I could meet you again... ...with my body like that time... It's frustrating. It's so painful that... ...there is too few things I can do for you. Like when you fell from the platform... ...if only I could stand up and reach your hand... I keep hurting you and making you unhappy more and more. That's why.. That's why... ...today will be the last. I really treasure you. That's why... ...please treasure your own life, Kawana. Thank you for everything. No. Let's break up. No. No. No... No. Senpai. No... After breaking up with Senpai... ...though the season is changing... ...I can't forget about him at all. Kawana, have you confirm the wall color for the other day? I've also confirmed the floor. You did well. You've completely become a working lady now. Eating hot-pot warms our body, right? You know, since I live alone, I seldom have hot-pot. I see. It was delicious. Thank you. Kawana, are you okay? I'm totally fine. I didn't drink much anyway. Not about that. It feels like you're just pretending to be fine. You're always like that since before, Koreda-kun. Your timing is good. And your judgement too. You know, back at high school before... ...you stopped me when I was about to throw away my painting, right? I was thinking of giving that picture to Senpai... ...but... ...I got broken-hearted and desperate. So I threw away the painting I had finally finished. Stupid, wasn't I? Because you stopped me from throwing it away, it could win a prize. Are you... ...still down? I've always thought... ...about what should I do to support him. Or whether I'm able to ease his pain or not. But I couldn't do anything in the end. I ended up being a heavy burden for him. I got told that my father collapsed due to stroke. So I have to go back to my hometown for a while. It's really helpful to have you here, Tsugumi. Thank God it's less severe than Dad's thought, right? Dad, don't forget to take your medicine later. Yeah. The picture of sakura tree you painted... I want to see it once again. Senpai. How are you doing now? I come to the school where I met you, Senpai. Senpai. How is your health? Do you force yourself? Do you smile? Senpai. I want to see you. Hello, Kawana? What? No. I'm at our high school now. I feel kind of nostalgic after I saw the picture you saved. That's why I thought, as usual, your timing is good. As expected from me. I remember lots of things. About Senpai? I see. I will always be... ...your ally, Kawana. Thank you. Hello. Hello, Kawana-san. It's been a long time. I'm Nagasawa. Sorry for contacting you so suddenly. I have something to tell you about Itsuki-kun. What happens to Senpai? I'm going back to Tokyo now. Is it about Ayukawa-kun? He has a surgery. Seems like it's a difficult one. So I think I will regret it if I don't go there. Tsugumi. Actually... ...I asked Ayukawa-kun to break up with you. Maybe I'm such a coward to hide it from you... ...but I don't think it's wrong for me to ask Ayukawa-kun about that. To wish for his daughter's happiness... ...is natural for me as a father. But to see things turn out like this... ...I can finally understand. Please decide it by yourself from now on. Dad. I understand it too. No one is alone. In difficult times... ...it's good if we can overcome it together, right? Though I thought you're still a child... ...apparently you're an adult already. I'm off. God, I beg you. Please save Senpai. Please. Tsugumi-san. Long time no see. Thank you for coming here. How is Senpai? He's doing his best now. You are the family of Ayukawa-san, right? Yes. Please come with me for a while. This way. Excuse me for a while. Thank you for calling me. Here. From Itsuki-kun. If something happens to him, he asked me to give this to you. "To Kawana" "I will have a surgery tomorrow." "The chance of it to be successful is not so high." "Perhaps we won't meet again." "To think about it..." "...I think I have to tell you this, no matter what." "So I write you this letter." "When I was at high school..." "...I had dreams and hopes about my future." "About what I would be..." "...I had such confidence." "But..." Ayukawa-kun. Let's go. I won't. Let's go! I won't! I've told you I wouldn't go! Though I go through the rehabilitation, my feet won't move. "No one could help me, and I couldn't even live an ordinary life." "I hate to trouble everyone around me." "So everyday was agonizing." "But even so..." "...I got support from a lot of people." "Little by little, I can move forward." "But..." "...even toward those people around me..." "...I started to build a wall around my heart." "That time, I met you again, Kawana." Please. Let him do it. I will attend to him as well. I won't let him force himself. Please. "You're still so clumsy like you used to..." "...and straightforwardly facing me." "You broke down the wall." I like you, Senpai. Thank you for letting me be your girlfriend. Me too. Thank you. "Being with you..." "...I can laugh like I used to." "I was so happy." "I never imagined that I would feel that way." "It's all thanks to you, Kawana." "I'm really grateful to you." "Kawana." "Thank you." "If I can see you once again..." "...I want us to go seeing that sakura together." How nostalgic. This place doesn't change at all. You always painted pictures here. I painted that picture thinking of giving it to you, Senpai. The picture of the gymnasium and this sakura tree. But I didn't give it to you in the end. Recently, I had a dream about us going to Enoshima. The scenery we saw from there... ...was the deep blue sky and sea. Both you and I were laughing.
