One moment Hello, Prime Records Saphirio, youÂ´re back! That's great U.K. is here, for Olivers records. But I'm a little tired I'll tell him Bye, Saphirio. Hello, Prime Records. I don't appreciate that kind of talk with me, Mambo. Call tomorrow, we're closing. Thanks Hey! Out of my way. - Hi, U.K. - What's up? - Olivers' latest record. -Can I see one of them? - See's good, man. - I know. Thanks. - Hey - Hi, Gift. - Hey, guys. - Hi, hi.... All right, yes! Gotcha! All right! - Are you there U.K.? - Of course. Ah, nice one. Leave me! Nice shot. Yeah, right. Damn! - What is it? -Someone stole your record. - Where did he go to? - You meet outside. Sorry. I want that record back. - You broke it! -Oh, mistake. What's the problem U.K.? You got five more. You know, I don't like it here. No beer! Later... How are you? Hey, where have you been? ...merci... Yeah, I like the green color, man. It's nice. How can they do this to me... - Oh no! - Let's see. What have they done to you? - Just check the color - That is my tree. Aren't you going to sign one? U.K.! Hey, U.K., come here. There only five records here. Where's the sixth one? - It was broken. - What do you mean "broken", you stupid! It was things like... - Good man, sorry, I'm going my show. - Nah, sorry. No, you can't come in. You can't come in, sorry. One "Castle" Better make that two. Who ever saw people people dance with no ceremony? The town makes them mad! Have all the ancestral spirits lost their manners, or is it just you? Your father reach to me from home. He's angry, Because you send him no money. How can i keep a cent when my jukwa wants offerings of beer day and night? I allowed you to come to the city to earn money for your family, not to play like a boy. A year has passed! - Look, I will send money when I can. You will send money, because we, ancestors, are going to force you in a proper job. - But I help uncle Oliver. - I'll put a spell on him. He'll put you in a proper job. Earn money and go home. Because there you belong. Remember, I'm your jukwa. I can cut your life like a string. Get out Anton... Enough. You're like a flee in my ear. - I'll get a bass plug. Anything else today? - Yeah, a job. - What? - I found you a proper job. - But I'm happy helping you. - U.K., you got to stand on your own feet. - Yeah, but... - You want me to take you back to your father? What job? Hey, U.K.! U.K.! Two double-scotch, two double-vodka and a coke for my princess And move it, now. I don't have a whole day. - He's a good pal. - Yeah, he's a good pal, boss. Look, resources need to be diverted into protection and controlled trading. Now I'm losing money for sure, 'cause you, idiots, can't keep it... exclusive. - We need more men-force. - No, no, I need more work! And no more expansion in the football sector. Elliot, this was your bad. Too late. Be gone. Let's go. - What's this? - Business, babe. - You got no manners, Johnson. - Sorry, this can't wait. I mean, take a hike...catch a cab... That man is too big for his boots! You can do better than Johnson, Sofi. - Who's talking... - Never trust him. I'm not a child. ...you want some? Hello, madam. You're so nice! Fancy lady over this. Let's have a look at you, baby. Nice legs. I'm looking for lady to meet. Obvious lady, that just... Stop that! She's kind of chick, eh? I like it like you. I like any...like you Impressive! How about this, eh? Hey man, leave her alone. Pass op! So, what's the matter babe? I cared...I can...I can do everything with you. I've got all the money. Come on yourself up! How about, ahh... Hey, man, leave her alone. ...I want that chick... I want her now... Bloody fool! Get in, who's fighting in my taxi? I'll kill him. Is it the one? I've got too many troubles... - He's dead. - Oh my god. - He's breathing! - Thank god. - You want to bring cops on me? - Shut up, this man is hurt. Serves him right. Why was he fighting in my taxi! Bloody fool. - No broken bones, lucky guy. - Could be fractures. - No, he shows no pain. - He's concussed. How can he show pain? Mild concussion, look, he's focusing on the girl. You can't determine the extent of the concussion just like that. I was a nurse! - Show me. You have no qualification... - Experienced with more than fifth... - Sofi? - You OK? U.K. Sofi? Why you looking at me like that? Sofi I feel, I could die in your arms. Yeah...as long as he doesn't die in my taxi. - Where're you going. - 7, Muzenda street, please. Hey, Isn't that Olivers place? - Well, Oliver is this boys' uncle. -Wow, great man Oliver. You're quite comfortable. I'm in heaven. - What's up? - He knocked his head. - You've been in trouble again? - It's not his fault. What happened? Tried to help me with this fresh guy. He meant well... Yeah... That's his problem. I've got it, it's OK. It's U.K. Hey, Oliver. That was a great record "Ma placou" - Let's go. - Anywhere you want, lady. There's no charge. City girls all mean trouble. U.K., I crush you today. Coke. - You fall of your bike? - Yeah, and my parachute didn't open. It's her. Hi You better? Lucky you didn't break your neck. - How much? - 7 dollars. - Hm? - 7 dollars. Did you lose your tongue in the accident? I must marry you, Sofi. I swear, on the grave of my ancestors. You are the one for me You got to be fooling, U.K. That's enough now. I think, you better see a doctor about that head of yours. It's not my head. It's my heart. - Afternoon, Mr. Chamba, sir. - Afternoon. Excuse me, sir. I've seen you around before. You are Olivers' nephew, aren't you? What do you want? - I've come to see you, sir. - So I see. What is it? I want your daughter Sofi, sir. What you want with her, that any fool-blooded man doesn't? - ...doesn't? - Doesn't want! C'mon, speak up, man, speak up. I'd like to marry her, sir. Marry...Sofi...? I bet you [are] as crazy about that Johnson hotshot, but I see, he doesn't stand a chance. That's because I love her, sir. No man with the brain should be struck by love. Is that, why you wear a bandage? - Where you got this funny name, U.K.? - At school, sir. People thought, I'll go far. I see. United Kingdom. Very good. When are you going? I'm not. You know. In spite of our high-tech lifestyle, we, Chambas, honor the traditional ways. - What's that? - For example the bride price - lobola - So you mean, I can marry Sofi? - Hold your horses... Rain in the air. She doesn't act crazy about you. Why is that? I will win her, sir. The trail of bride price and Johnson, I'll get plenty of time to see what you're made of, U.K. - Then she'll be mine? - With luck, the bride price will shift things your way. You'll be the leading horse. And who knows. Honeymoon in London. You could see the queen. I'll get you a dozen goats from home immediately. The cattle, too. Big...fat... Young man, I'm a factory foreman. What would I do with a bunch of goats shitting on my carpet? I've got all your uncles' records. Even the latest one. We could listen to it, if my radiogram wasn't totally bugged. ...shame. U.K., if Sofi is your mission, that's the bride price. I wanna Philips, in mukwa wood. Not these monsters. They cost about two grand. You know mukwa? - Must it be mukwa? - Must it be Sofi? - But I'm only a waiter. - Young man, don't dissapoint me with negative thinking. You must understand who're you dealing with. I am a factory foreman. A man of substance. And Sofi is the apple of my eye. Very well, sir. I will start organizing the bride price at once. - Good for you... And let's say, 500 dollars in cash. Thank you, sir. Good luck, young man. Don't forget, mukwa. One year guarantee, and no second hand garbage. - This is of batanga, a new version. - Colour, colour. It's different. It's different. OK, because the out is cleaner. Not like a couple...three shops round[the corner]... ...than they had something of that lights. A little darker...a little lighter. OK? but than they told me all they needed to do is to put "Vanish" or something. No, but this one is really mukwa. Hey! The greed of the city eats your heart. - Are you off again? - The girl has friends who steal from others. - Sofi is not like that. As your jukwa, I will not accept that. Johnson is evil. Over my dead body that girl will be yours. You've been dead 30 years anyway. So that's ok. She's put a spell on you. The battle between us will be hard. - Don't fight Sofi -It's you I'll be fighting. You won't listen to me. - I don't want a jukwa. You came from our son of the "sorry", and in depth you'll return. A reminder of what I can do. - Get away, get away, get away, give me a dollar. ...and then you have to work, cause you probably make my wife of course... ...so you're coming out tonight, ok?... Sofi, amazing! What a hell is he doing here? - He's sweet on me. - What? It's gonna be a joke of the century...him? -...I'm mad about you - What? with me? you must be kidding. Why aren't you listening to me? Let me...who are these people? Johnson, these people are my friends. I'm not gonna spend all night cocky at you. - Ahh, jeez... - Nomsa, do you remember that guy, I was telling you about? - Which one, the short one? He's right behind us. He's the one who's bringing us the drinks. What is this suppose to be? Is this something you want? What is your problem? - You're driving me up the way... - No, I'm not. Your drinks. Thank you. Let's move over mine... Bring me more beers. Another round to my friends on that table over there. Another round like this, and keep them flowing. Now. Look, I can take you anywhere, buy you anything You want to go to UK. Shopping in London, eh? Let's go. You have to learn some manners first. Just who keeps you alive? You're my people, right? All of you. I rent cars, I sell soccer stars. Damn it, I even promote that band there. Mumbo Wamba, sir. Get the order U.K. - Just, who does she think she is? - Never mind London. You didn't take me to Njanga. Who do you think you are? Jesus! Shit man, look at this. What kind of dump is this? - I'll get you another one. - That's not good enough, man. I want an apology, you idiot. Oh, I'm sorry. Daddy Long-legs is too drunk to apologize. Out of here. Now! Soon enough I'll sort this out. Thank you. Get this scum out of my way. Your bill. 55! I'm sorry, I can't pay that. Don't worry. I told you the rules. No credit. No second chances. Hello, my burden. How are you this warm night? You got yourself fired. Without my help. I'm unemployed, like you. Good afternoon. Please sit down. Your name? - Sorry, no license, no job. - But I'm very fast on a bicycle. Look, this is a high class bakery. We deliver by motorcycle or van. Good bye. One minute please, sir. Tell me, how much you spend on parking fines each year? I bet it's plenty. I don't know. Probably several thousands. - Thousands?! - It's an overhead, like electricity. Now I'm sorry. I'm looking for one more driver. Good bye. But I'm no loss, sir. I ride through the traffic fast, like a bee. Traffic jams - zero. Parking fines - zero. No gas even. Think of that. A bicycle, sir, is the most flexible piece of machinery that god ever made. And, I give a personal touch. Get out of my sight. Go on, push off. Hello Oh my god. I hardly know you. And you talked to my father about marriage. - He set the bride price. - Get the message, U.K. I'm not interested. - You will, when you get to know me. - Cheek. No one loves you like me, Sofi. Johnson doesn't. - Non of your business. - I'll be yours. Forever. You never looked at me twice. Suddenly, you hit your head on the road and you love me. Bye, U.K. Hey, hey, leave that. If you can't get a good job, who is to blame? Why're you messing with Sofi? She's just a big headed girl. What's the matter with you? Hey, what are you doing here? You're fired. Since when do you fire customers. Bring me one "Castle" Ah, my rival. Have you raised 50 bucks yet? Only 2000 to go. Sofi, would you like to have a dance with me? See the way she dances? Hot stuff, boss. Give me a picture of you, Sofi. You've seen enough of me already. Gift...let me tell you, last night was like... like a dream, you know... I mean, she flows, man. She's active...like waterfall. - Like Victoria falls? - Yes. - He's too cheeky, boss. - Yeah, I think our little friend needs a lesson. - Go wrap this as a parcel. - It's not that easy. Don't think. Just wrap it. I see, jit is your kind of music, U.K. Would you like to make a few dollars? - It depends. - Well I need to...summon a delivery to my stadium. Quickly... Hundred dollars do? - Why should you help me? - No, no, no, you're helping me... You see, Gift isn't feeling so well right now. Nor so? And besides, I was a country boy once. And you know, if we going to compete for the same princess, we might as well have a fair fight. Nor so? Good...here's 50 dollars to give you a ground here. The balance - later. I want you to go at the managers' enclosure, at the eastern grand-stad ask for Elliot...got that? Elliot. Gift, give him the parcel and the pass to get in. He's got the spirit, that boy. The whole lot of spirit. Which one is Elliot? I also put a little something for Johnson. It's me, the old bag... Thanks, Ambria. Hey. I want beer, you scram. Jukwa, I'm worried about you. This beer drinking business, it's not good for your health. Don't give me a lies. Beer, beer! My damnation, you owe it to me. My place...is at Sofis' side.

What about Sofi? You're a frontrunner, U.K. I know that perfect, my boy. - Last one lost. - Ten for Stage, she's a 100 percent! I'll have Ten for Stage! Ten for stage. I'll take Ten for Stage. I'll have Ten for Stage. She's perfect. - So what did she say? - It's not easy, U.K., to win such a girl. But I thought, I gave you everything you said you wanted. They are off! Ten for Stage. Where are you, my beauty... We'll have to talk about my daughter, U.K. There she is! Ten for Stage! Journey to Sofis' heart is painful... she's nr. 3 from the back, good place for a 2K.

Linda is away...not too soon, Ten for Stage... easy, easy, girl... ...not too soon, now... move all in front the weels... - What way? - Up, up!! Rise to power! He's blocking my horse. Ten for Stage, Goooo! Go, Ten for Stage, go!! No, he's blocking my horse... No, no, no... You see, U.K., women are ruled by two things. Money and sex. Sex? She gazzles like a goalie...but money! That's why Johnson's around. Johnson's out to marry her? Well, you see, as yet, I've had no fam[ily] confes, but you have to be quick. You're forcing him into the corner. You move anytime now. How can I do it? - Never! - Everyday you must get closer to her heart. - Liar! - Well, you see, I don't think you're losing to Johnson. And she is not real by her style. Let's say it's a neck-a-neck. That...this fridge will impress her, for sure. It will tip the odd in your favor. - I'm not a horse! - U.K., I'm backing you all the way. Go for it! Never have any of my ancestors been as stupid as you. I'll shake the stones out of your head and ground them to dust if you try and buy that thing... Right? U.K.! Hey U.K.! What's happened, guys? What's this? - It's for your bride price. - He's reading you, man. - How did you get this? - We danced in town... - I can't have that. - Call us, if we can help again. See you, U.K. - They believe, U.K. will go on fire? - No one has ever done this for me. They give me ideas too. - What ideas? Thinking, doing, you know... You really want that Sofi, don't you? It's Sofi, or... - Nothing will stop you? - Nothing. Are you languaging our family spirits? - Are you taking good care of them? - I'm trying. Maybe you should try harder. Jukwa Jukwa... jukwa! Jukwa... I give up, Ambuia, I've got an libation here. I want to make peace with my jukwa. Jukwa. Ambuia... welcome. - Are those for me? - Of course. You'd let me die, you pest. Suddenly you're full of respect. Why? I've given up, jukwa. You're too strong for me. Here, accept my offerings. Forgive me. At last you see those Chambas for what they are. - Is this new beer? - You like it? Soon I will get back to our country. In bare feet I will, and to the earth of our people. I'll make up for my bad ways. ...you're gonna do a wonderful job... - He's killing himself. It's not fair. - Quiet! - You're using him. Tell him to get lost! - Tell him to get lost yourself. Hi, U.K. How are you? - OK. And you? - Fine, thanks. - Expensive. - Such prices. If prices went down, it wouldn't be prices. How about bride prices? Big value, small money. You're crazy, U.K. About you. Maybe we should go for a jit-jive at "Queens" sometime. You see, whatever the boy offers, you must realize, I can improve on that. I'm growing to like him. He's a tryer, but, well, I don't know. What do you say, Sofi? What's this now? Taxi service. Jump on, where you goin' ? - To the house. - Go on, jump in, let's go. Where? On your head? Sorry guys, it's a breakdown. Oh, c'mon man. No charge, sorry, nothing I can do. Sorry. There's no charge anyway. You guys will be all right. There is another one coming just now. I'm sorry my dear. Jump in. Yeah, that's it. - Slow down. - I think it's Water World. - I have to go home. - What? I have to go home! Slow down. Are you ready to go? Hey man, what you're waiting for? Soap? The blue leader. It's on the front seat. C'mon, hurry. You must leave now. Johnson wants your blood for taking me out. - I'm busy, Sofi. - Please leave... Now. Where do you think you're going? Snake. - Oliver needs this. - I want a word with you first. It's urgent. I'm sorry. No one messes with my woman. You understand? No one! Get up! You coward, c'mon. C'mon! No! Stop it. Kill him, kill him, boss. Kill him. Stop it! Stop it! I've got to go. Leave me that. Just a scratch. What are you all staring at? What's that? Johnson rise on his luck, but that man... ...he's dutiful. Let me waste him, boss. Cut his heart out. Fools. Always predictable. - Sure, boss. "Sure, boss". Sure to get the kid and that slut [bails] the moment you lay a finger on him. I want a modern circulation. How, boss? - Couple years in the cells should wipe the smile of his face. - But how? Plan, kids. A lot of you! What you mean "what i'm talking about"? You know what I'm talking about. This after collection was short. Never. What's wrong with you? What's your problem? Look at your damn brain. You sick or what? Get your manners, Johnson, you, shit. ...two dollars, all batch... What are you doing? Johnsons' territory. Last warning. - Take it easy, U.K. - I received the last warning. Going from Johnson...I tell you straight, man... It gave me sweet pleasure. - Look, I'm not selling, so vanish. - I like your style, U.K. I've come to congratulate you. Well, thanks. See you. You want Sofi, right? I wanna help. Come, we go talk. - But why help me? - You take Johnsons girl. I get satisfaction. - I don't want to endanger Johnson. It's your problem. - It's dumb man. Cause he sure wants your blood. Just kidding. He won't smash you. Could have done you in back there. So you never speak to him again. - So if they want to hurt me, what would they do ? - Stop even being a fish. Let's sort this fridge out, so you can get Sofi. You and me are on the same side. Hello, Gift. Ok, U.K. - There she is. Hinari fridges. - What a beauty. Hell of a job to steal this, U.K. This is great. - Watch it, U.K. - Ok, hold it, careful, careful. - I've got it. Slowly, slowly. - Right, that's it. OK, yeah, we've done it. Come sir, a gambler remains a gambler. Back the horse of the highest stakes. I wonder, what that is. Well, take a look at this. - He's done it. - My god. Proceed...right in. Move... Mind the door. Mind the door. Down boys. Down, down, down... Yeah. Very good. Thank you very much, boys. Thank you. You can go home now. Bye! Bye. U.K. You're the man of miracles. Isn't he, Sofi? Oliver, I'm on it. Your nephew will get to the U.K. I think he's got some other ideas, Chamba. The bride price. Paid in full. Come on, Mr. Chamba sir. Let's not beat about the bush here. I am offering, double the price of this machine for Sofis' hand. Ten thousand dollars. Cash. What do you think I am? A car at an auction? I don't want either of you. I told you, she's hard to please. You wound up a bit late. I want to see you, my beauty. Give me the key, boy. I've got them, somewhere.. It's the cops. What could they want? Any idea, U.K.? - What is it sergeant? - Can I look around? Of course, but can you please explain. - Where is this come from? - U.K. just brought it. - It's my daughters bride price. - This is a stolen commodity. U.K. couldn't get the cash together. He stole it. - You are the one called Johnson, aren't you? - My pleasure. You say, he stole it. Well, sure, sergeant, he's just wheeled it in like Mr. Chamba just said. Any proof? Sergeant, you're not making any sense here. I found the key. What have we here. The king of car thieves. I've been looking for this one for a long time. - And Mr. Johnson. - You can't touch me. This U.K. put my man in a fridge. Gift! What a hell is going on? What is going on is...U.K. told me what's going on. - He came to see me with your nice little plan, Johnson. - He could never pay for this. I mean, he couldn't. - This is a deposit slip. Let's go. Excuse me. - Hey, nice one, U.K. - Sorry, for the inconvenience, Mr. Chamba. U.K., help me load this baby full of beer. Just cause you got the bride price doesn't mean you got the bride. So, city life is not so bad, is it, jukwa? Will you continue to look after me? Me and Sofi that is. - Now you must work hard. - Chamba got me a job. - What job? - With national butlers. - I'm in marketing. - Is that flaunting? It's like flaunting, jukwa. It's getting drinks to thirsty people. Prince!
