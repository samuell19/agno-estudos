[MUSIC PLAYING] MOSES: Hey, what are you doing here? DAVID: I'm what you've been waiting for. MOSES: What? DAVID: I'm who you're going to fall in love with. -What? -We're going to spend the rest of our lives together. -This is craziness. Just craziness. What's your sign? DAVID: I'm a Leo. -What's your favorite color? -Actually, I prefer a favorite color combination. Uh, right now, I'm really into baby blue and chocolate brown. Oh, I love what you've done with the walls in here. -What's your favorite song? -"Autumn Sweater" by Yo La Tengo. -And we're married. -You're not ready yet. -Oh, but I am. I'm so totally needy. Ready. -What are these? -From work. -And-- and you were going to just throw them away? -Well, I'm not going to wipe my butt with them. [ALARM BEEPING] [CHANTING] [KNOCKING] -Jesus Christ, can you please stop singing? -[HUMMING]. -Ooh, you have gum. Can I have some? Oh, shit. I'm such a douche. Were you in the middle of getting dressed? -Oh, god no. No, my parents were nudists. Yeah, this is way overdressed as far as I'm concerned. -Well, you know what? I can dig it just as long as you don't get fat. Oh my god, I love what you have done with this room. It is bitching. Oh. My last roommate, all French country. Oh my god, she had to be stopped. -Are you OK? You look kind of ragged. -What? OMG, um, I think I got raped last night. [SIGH] You know what? I'm going to call this look the accused. All I need now is a pinball machine. -Something happened to you? -Yeah. I only got dumped by Mr. Aaron Parkinson. Apparently, I have boundary issues. Apparently, it's not OK to makeout with his friends. -Oh, god. I'm so sorry. -You know what? I hope he gets cancer of the ass. And I hope he shits blood. Oh, I'm cramping so bad today. You know what? I'm not even going to work. Fuck it. Aaron puts me on morning shift after breaking up with me. What the fuck is up with that? [SCOFF] OMG. You know what? Give me a tarot card reading. -No, I have to go to work. -No, come on. Just do it really fast. -OK. Sit on the bed. And you have to shuttle the deck and think about your hopes and dreams, and then the future and what stands in your way. -Oh my god. Aaron, he is such a fucking ingrate. You know what? I did everything for him. It was-- [SIGH]. He never paid me any attention. But you know what? His friends did. And maybe it was like, he doesn't have the problem, you know? No, you know what? He does have the problem. I cannot even believe that I sucked his dick. You know, I cannot-- first date, too. It was amazing. You know, usually I'm not the kind of girl that does stuff like that. But I thought it was special. -So I have the cards laid out in four positions around the outside. And the one closest to you is you. So that's where you're coming home. That's the things that live within you. And that's where the reading is going to come from. OK, so the first card that you have is the 10 of wands, which is oppression. You're coming from a place of-- -He totally oppresses me. -OK. -He treats me so bad. -OK, good. Keep that in mind. Your second one over here is the seven of disks, which stands for failure. Failure is what is your affirmation. That is, what has been confirmed that is in your future. -Oh, that sucks. -OK? -Do another one. -Your third one-- we 'll keep moving. The third one is your negation, and that is the princess of swords. -Oh, I'm going to stab him in the face? -Right. But that's your negation. That's your obstacle that lies ahead. -Shit, like prison? -Um, OK. Now, this position stands for your hopes and dreams. And usually, your hopes and dreams are the-- -I hope he gets the clap. --same thing. Oh. So you have the tower because you thrive on chaos. Yeah, OK. And then your final outcome was disappointment. -What the hell kind of reading is that? It-- no, you know what? Do another deck. Do another one where I am like the [INAUDIBLE]. -That's not how it works. This is the real deal. OK, you're tapping into some raw stuff here. I'm juiced. I had a seizure this morning. -Are your serious? -Yeah, I told you about it when I moved in. -Yeah, but you said you didn't have it anymore. Are you OK? -Yeah, I'm great. -What is it you have again? -Temporal lobe epilepsy. -Oh my god, you like shake all around? -Uh, no. It's not like that. Here's what happens. Um, my brain sort of spasms in my temporal lobes. OK? They're part of the limbic system that controls emotion and memory. And that part of the brain is where feelings of divinity and religious experiences happen. So when they spasm and seizure, it's as if these giant waves of god rush through me. -Oh my god. I knew this girl one time who did like 10 tabs of ecstasy and the same thing happened to her, but then she died. But before she died, she like baptized three people or she spit on them, or something. I don't know, I can't remember the story. But oh my god, that sucks. When did that start happening? -Well, my first memory is of an episode. See, my parents were married on this clothing-optional soy farm. And then at some point after I was born, these Mormons came knocking on the farm and my parents were tripping balls. So we were converted. Yeah. So, um, there was this time when I was in church and I started to feel these angels singing to me. And I stood up and I started speaking to them. And apparently it was only gibberish at the time, but it made sense to me. And then ever since then, my parents have been calling me Moses. But when I was 13, I fell in love with this 14-year-old Jew who was on the track team. And he had that wavy Jew hair. Oh, he was dreamy. -So sweet and anti-semitic. -It's not anti-semitic. You cannot hate someone's people if you think they're sexy. -Oh. -Anyway, I had a seizure while I was making out with him. Needless to say, I found the real Jesus in his pants. -You know what? You totally need to write a book. No, a gospel. MOSES: Yeah, right. -So what'd you see? -What? -You said you had a vision. -Seizure. -No, whatever. You know, what'd you see? -So here's what happened. I was in bed. I was asleep, and then it was-- I felt alive, like everything came together. But then I was like, ah, I don't feel right. Something's off. It feels like the last time I was about to have a seizure. -You must finish this before you can be ready for me. -Is that sanitary? -You see, that's why you're not ready. -All right. All right, fine. But can we still makeout? -Nothing comes without struggle. Any prophet will tell you that. -Am I going to have to get crucified or something? -No. That boy was a total drama queen. I'll see you soon. -This kicks ass. -What do you think it means? -I think it means my friend would jiz if he saw this. He works at a gallery on Peoria Street. -It's not supposed to be art. It's supposed to be my destiny. -Wow. That was fucking deep. -Mm. All right, well, I got to get to work. -Mm. Thanks for the reading. -See you later. -OK. [BUZZER RINGING] -Who is it? MOSES: GuysMaid4U. -Come on up. [KNOCKING] MOSES: Oh my god, what happened? -You know what? Uh, what happened? I don't know. I just moved in here. -It's not a problem. -A family of six lived here before me. Can you imagine that Cirque Du Soleil? But a mother of five's idea of clean is vastly different from a faggot, you know what I'm screaming? Of course you do, you're gay. Is that too personal? -No. No, that's not too personal. Yeah, me and penises are like that. -Oh, good. Well, this place just reeks of emotionally abandoned children. I can't have that. Do you think you can get rid of it? -Oh, god. For an extra $50, I'll totally smudge your apartment. All I need is a quarter pound of fresh sage. -I don't know, I'm a Jew fairy. We don't do voodoo. We do Mr. Clean. -Got it. You can look. -Oh. -It's OK, I'm not embarrassed. That's why we do it in our underwear. -I just didn't want to be rude. MOSES: Yeah. You paid me to clean your house. It's not a problem. Do you mind if I listen to music? -No. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could you take your underwear off? -Um, no. It hurts to get bleach and ammonia on my crotch. -Oh. -How about a jock strap? I think I have one. MOSES: Um, really. I'm good. Thanks. -Well, can I take my clothes off. -Um, you know what? Let's not do that. -Well, can I touch you? Can I touch myself? -OK, this is my friend, Pete. Oh, he's Thor now. Um, he's probably more what you're looking for. I just clean your house while you watch. He's a body worker. -Oh, great. I just want to get the ground rules down. -It says in my ad-- -People say a lot of things in their ads. I had some guy say he was straight acting and he came over sounding gayer than Carol Channing. -Carol Channing's not gay. -Well, he sounded like Carol Channing. What's your name? -Moses. -I knew you were Jewish. -I am not a Jew, which my first boyfriend was a Jew-- ish. -I'm reformed. But still neurotic. -Ha, all right. So do I clean up your nachos or do I go? Ah. Come on. Come on, seizure. MAN (VOICEOVER): Clean my boots. I want to see them spit-shined. MAN (VOICEOVER): What do I want you to clean? I want you to clean my balls. That's what I want you to clean. MAN (VOICEOVER): Oh, no, that's just discharge. MAN (VOICEOVER): That stain over there? No, that's not blood. That one over there, that one is blood. MAN (VOICEOVER): It puts the lotion in the basket. MAN (VOICEOVER): A family of six lived here before me, can you imagine that Cirque Du Soleil? MAN (VOICEOVER): You must finish this before you can be ready for me. MOSES (VOICEOVER): All right. All right, fine. But can we still makeout? MAN (VOICEOVER): Nothing comes without struggle. Any prophet will tell you that. MOSES (VOICEOVER): Can we still makeout? Can we still makeout? Can we still makeout? Can we still makeout? -This is it. This is it. -Ah. -Oh, god. I'm so sorry. -Oh, no. No, don't apologize. It was actually pretty great. Um, look I have a situation. -Oh, I'm sorry, it's cash only. I'm a human magnet for bad checks. -No, no, no, the guy that repaired my computer's coming over and I was hoping you could wear something more when he's here. -Oh, I don't mind if he sees me. -No, no, no. I don't want the repair guy to know that I'm a perverted old faggot. -You shouldn't care what other people think about you. -What's with the lip? I'm paying you. -Yeah, to clean your apartment with my clothes off. [BUZZER RINGING] -Oh my god, look at you. He's going to think I'm a child molester. Come on up. -Oh my god, breathe. -Please put some pants on. -All right. All right. Don't pass out. JOB: Hey, come on in. The computer's over here. DAVID: Oh, uh, yeah. About your computer, I'm sorry to say, but your hard drive crashed. I would recommend getting a new model, or at least upgrading the motherboard. But you'd be happy to know that the new model comes in several different color combinations. I have one in brown and blue. You don't have a cat in here, do you? JOB: No. DAVID: I have really bad allergies. JOB: I don't have a cat. DAVID: It is, uh, that time of season. JOB: You mean you can't retrieve my files? I have to start all over? DAVID: Nothing comes without struggle, any prophet will tell you that. JOB: I don't have the time to start over. DAVID: Well, sir. There's really not a whole lot I can do. -The sponges were right all along. -I have no idea who that man is. -No, not on the-- oh my. -What the hell? I like girls. I like-- I like pussies and vaginas and-- and vulvas. Yeah, that, too. I like vulvas. A lot. -I think I handled that the wrong way. JOB: Why the hell can't we do that? I pay you $200 for a damn glimpse of your bulge and all I get is you cleaning my windows. -Oh, no, no, no. -That young nerd is here two minutes before you're cleaning the back of his throat. MOSES: No, don't understand-- -Get out. Get out with your hard biceps and your pecs of steel and your-- -Ew. Yeah, I should go. -Oh, control that's just great. My touch disgusts you. That's a real treat to know. How dare you. I hope that young nerd gives you strep throat. -Oh my god. Are you here to beat me up? -How did you know? MOSES: Know what? -I didn't even know. I mean, I never even had a clue. I never even thought about it. -All right. It's because of this sponge. -That kiss. It was-- it was fucking awesome, man. -Well, thanks. I'm glad you approve. I've always been a strong believer in a good lip to tongue ratio. -Can we do it some more? -Hi, guys. I think it's super great that you're hitting it off. But I was wondering, could you get the fuck out of here? -Are you coming? -I'm just looking at the symbol of our future love. -Let's just stick to the kissing part. -OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SINGING) You appeared from somewhere else. Somewhere I'd never seen. Big and buff, bold and tough, you like Mr. Clean. Now I feel the water hit me, a slow and steady stream. A sponge to wash the lust inside me. Can it get me clean? Wash it. Wash it. So dirty. Wash it. Wash it. Keep it clean. Wash it. Wash it. It's so dirty. Wash it. Wash it. Dip it in me. Stick it in me. See you walk out the door. See you [INAUDIBLE]. See you. I don't want [INAUDIBLE]. See you next Tuesday. See you walk out on me. See you praying for me. See you worse off than me. See you next Tuesday. See you walk out the door. See you [INAUDIBLE]. See you. I don't [INAUDIBLE]. See you next Tuesday. Hi, I'm Glintentica. -No, you're Chloe Savalon. I downloaded your album. I even paid for it. -I am speaking to you through her image. -Are you God? -There is no God. Only Glintentica. At long last, a cleansed soul has finally answered my beacon. -Yeah, it's the epilepsy. -You have much to prepare for. I'm coming for you. -Really? -I will arrive on Tuesday June 6th. -Oh, wow. That's like in three months. It's cool we got the same calenders. -Start your preparations. You must cleanse the souls. Learn from my messages in the sponges. May you find comfort in their absorbance. -Thank you, Schenectady. -It's Glintentica. -Right. Uh, so this is my true destiny? Uh, what about David? -Only those with faith in you can be part of your true destiny. I shall see you at midnight Tuesday June 6th. -Hey. Are you OK? -What's going on? -Wow. You really are tired, aren't you? But why did you fall asleep in the closet? You on drugs? You have just have some weird microchip planted in your brain that makes you do weird things? -God. What did I do? -Not much. You were singing. That's what woke me up. MOSES: Really? -Mm-hmm. And like belting it, like Freddie Mercury belting. -[SIGH]. DAVID: Come on, let's get ready. MOSES (VOICEOVER): The last time I fell for a guy, my vision stopped. But I did have a vision last night. Does that mean I don't love David? Or does it mean I never loved [INAUDIBLE]? Oh, god. Screw it. So that night I told him. I told him about my visions and how the sponges led me to him. I bared my soul. I didn't bring up Glintentica, though. I didn't want to scare him all at once. But I did want him to know that I thought the visions were real. They were more than just seizures. But he told me that it was all just-- -Chemicals. It's chemicals reacting in your brain. -Well, you could say the same thing about love. You could say the same thing about God. -Who believes in God anymore? -Well, you know, like there's something greater. Like a next level. I mean, don't you think that we move on to something else when we die? -I think when we die, we're dead. When we're dead, we're just nothing. I'm an atheist. MOSES (VOICEOVER): Well, that doesn't make any sense. Why would the vision send me to an atheist? To convert him? Or is he right? Are these seizures just hippy-dippy brain farts? -June 6th, 2006. 6, 6, 6. Well, that can't be good. Well, let's just hope it is hippy-dippy brain farts. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): [INAUDIBLE] to truly baptize a soul, you must cleanse them inside and out. The more you relish in Earthly delights, the further you are away-- To realize that your body is a living conduit to my membrane. I shall touch you in strange places. MOSES (VOICEOVER): OK, I know it looks crazy, but I was never happier. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Wednesday, Tuesday. MOSES (VOICEOVER): I was on a pathway to enlightenment, and I found love. But there was a catch. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Friday, Monday, Sunday. MOSES (VOICEOVER): I couldn't tell David about the visions anymore. He was all science and technology. He'd just think I was crazy. But it kept eating at me. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): May 20th. May 22nd. May 25th. MOSES (VOICEOVER): My meditations were suffering because of it, so I decided to spill my guts. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): May 29th. May 30th. May 31st. June 1st. June 2nd. -Well, aren't you going to say anything? -It's just-- you know, we've been together for how long? A month? And for maybe a week of that, you weren't a liar. -I know I should have told you that I was still having the seizures. -No. You told me you went to the doctor. -I did. -You said he prescribed you medicine. You said the seizures stopped. -Well, I tried those pills, but it's-- but it's just that when I'm with you, you make it seem like it's all in my head. And when I'm with you, I don't care. I'm just happy. But when I'm alone, she comes to me and she wants me to prepare. -Moses, look. Spatuleta is not real. -Glintentica. Don't laugh at me. -No, no, no, sorry. I just downloaded a picture of Wolverine and Cyclops having sex. -Oh, god. Who's the bottom? I would not have guessed that. -Thanks. -Mm-hmm. -I don't know what you want me to say. -I just want you to-- [SIGH]. I just want you to believe me. -I believe you have seizures. -No, I want you to believe that they're real. That they mean something. -But we know it's the seizures. You have temporal sclerosis. It causes temporal lobe epileptic seizures. It's a real disease. -But I saw you in my vision, and then you came to me. My division changed you. -For the last time, your vision didn't turn me. I was dating a girl, now I'm dating a boy. It's not the miracle you make it out to be. Look, honestly, it's not like it was a big surprise. I mean, I used to love watching male gymnastics and swimming, wrestling. -So what does this mean? -It means that when you're ready to start taking your medication, you'll be ready for me. Till then, you're just not ready. -You're right, I'm not ready. But I will be on June 6th. Come back to me then. Then it will be OK. -Can I get you guys anything else? -No, just the bill. -OK. -Put it away. You're broke. -I don't want you to have to pay the bill. -No, no, no. I'm the one who convinced you to stop cleaning houses naked. It's not like I'm just going to cut you off. Not right away. -I'm sorry. -Hey. I was just wondering if we could have a little roomie to roomie chat. -About what? -About you and your sponges. -I told you, they're about Glin-- -Glin-ticky-ticky-tavy. I know. -Glintentica. -Whatever. I think that you have been thinking this through all wrong. I think if you think about it, then you should be addressing how all of this is affecting me. And realize that you are incredibly boring. But I have someone here who can help get you a little focused, so, you know, you can brush your teeth, take a shower, pay the rent. You know, just off the top of my head. -Hey, lay off. I don't need a doctor. Hey, get out. You didn't say he was here. -Let me explain. I was just getting to it. -Ruth, beat it. You're as gentle as a hate crime. -You'll be the victim of a hate crime. -Just give me a moment, will you? -Listen, doctor, I'm fine. What are you doing? -This piece on the ceiling, what do you call it? -A leaking roof. -It's so natural. Well, this room is very fascinating. Do you want to tell me about it? -Who are you? -Are you uncomfortable when someone unknown enters your space? -Um, yeah. Do you feel the need to be isolated in order to create these pieces on the ground? -I just have some things I need to figure out before June 6th. -Oh. What happens then, the apocalypse? -Oh, god. I hope not. -Do you work best when you are in love or in pain? Some people say that those are the only two emotions, love and pain. Some other people say that there are only two people, those who feel and those who feel too much. -Which am I supposed to be? -That's what I'm asking you. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Why did you arrange the sponges in this way? -It's how they needed to be. -Fascinating. Look at you, you are an old man trapped in the body of a boy. It takes schizophrenics 20 years sometimes to create pieces like this. -Do you think I'm schizophrenic? I don't know if you want to prescribe any medication, but the last doctor gave me some pills that did decrease the seizures. -Pills? Decrease the seizures? -Yeah. -Are you crazy? This is a goldmine. -Aren't you here to help me? -I'm here to make you a star. I'm Seth Smith. I work at the Mind Cruncher Gallery on Peoria and Randolph. We have a group show coming up and you are a must have. -You're here for the sponges? You don't even understand what the sponges mean. I need to figure out my destiny. I have a calling, a calling from Glintentica. She's coming for me on June 6th, and I need to be ready for her. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Quiet. You've said too much. -Yes. But you need to share your coma. You need followers. You need an avenue to share your visions with the world, and I can help you with that. I'm always looking for new pieces to show. -These aren't art. They're just the products of the inane ramblings that are spasming out of my head. -That would sound great on a panel. Look, here's my card. Why don't you give me a call and let me know when I can pick the sponges up. -I didn't say I'd give them to you. -You will. You're not the only one with visions. You were right. He's fantastic. People are going to eat this crazy shit up with a spoon. So what's the take? -I discuss that with the artist. -I'm his manager. -I'll sure you'll get a take. -He owes me rent. -But you believe him, don't you? -I don't know. He did meet David right after he had a vision of him. -Huh. Well, I don't care if he is crazy or the second coming. What he's doing is totally in right now. -Yes. -I am not giving my sponges away. They haven't told me what to do yet. -That's fine. Fine, fine, fine. There was a message on the machine today. Eric called. -Ugly Eric? -I don't know, he said blonde Eric. -Hot Eric? -It could have been retarded Eric. I don't know, he called. He wants you to come and clean his apartment. He wants you to wash his floors. -Ruth, I'm in the middle of a revelation. -These words again-- I, I, I am so sad. I have epilepsy, but I don't shake around. I like sponges. What about me? You're totally fucking up my credit. And I can't cover your ass. We haven't even fucked. -All right, fine. I'll go. -So you're really going to clean my apartment first? -First? -You know, before the good stuff. -Uh, you don't get any good stuff with me. You never have and you never will. -I know you think I'm cute. Fine, be professional. A professional tease, that's what you are. Where's my beer? Ah, in the bathroom. Do you do laundry? -Do you have a washer and dryer? -Actually, I go to the laundromat across the street. -You want me to go to the laundromat in my underwear? -Do you want to go to the laundromat in your underwear? -Oh, god. All right, here's a card. It's my friend Thor. Oh, he's Enrique now. Uh, he's a body worker. -Cut the shit, let's see the goods. -Hey, that's not cool. -Come on, you totally gave me a happy ending last time. -No, I didn't. -You didn't? Who was that? Oh, right. Right. -Learn from my messages in the sponges. -I remember who that was. -You must cleanse the souls. -That wasn't you. -Hey. -Shh. Don't say another word. I see your sadness. It calls to me. It begs to be purged from your soul. The obstructions of the physical world can confuse our soul's true desires and emotions. -This stuff smells. -It's kind of burning my eyes. -You are being exonerated of the demons that are crippling your soul. This is not something to be taken lightly. I am offering you a direct link to Glintentica, and a chance to purify your soul. -These fumes are making me dizzy. -Breathe deeply. It will cleanse your soul. It will destroy the filth that you have breathed deep into your lungs. MOSES (VOICEOVER): It was then at that moment that it finally dawned on me. When I washed this poor homeless soul, I was filling him with my energy from Glintentica. I am a direct link to her, and it's growing stronger. She's not going to appear before me on June 6th, she's going to take me over. My body will be the host for Glintentica, and I must cleanse my body before she can enter. -Seth? Um, I'm ready. Yeah, I've change my mind. It's all happening on Tuesday, June 6th. Bring your camera, something big is going to happen. OK, see you next Tuesday. -Because Jason walks in and sees him-- -How's it going? -Can you hold on for just a second? All right. Yeah-- -How's it going? -Horrible. It's still 14 hours to midnight and I am bored. Something better happen soon or I'm going to have to start making shit up. -Fine with me. I'll be back after dinner. Maybe he'll start acting psycho by the time it gets dark. -Nothing comes without struggle. Any prophet will tell you that. Can we do it some more? And then you [INAUDIBLE]. I'm just looking at the symbol of our future love. -Hey, honey. -I knew you'd come. -Here's the deal. I love you. MOSES: Do you believe me? -I want to. I want to start over right now. -Let me baptize you. -No. No. I want to start over without all this. -What? I haven't see you for a month and you expect me to stop searching for what I've been looking for? -You're not going to find what you're looking for in a fucking sponge. You should be able to find what you're looking for right here in me. -I'm sorry. You don't understand. -Please. -I can't. -So that's a no? -It's a no. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. -You're just the vision that I first had of David. You never really came to me? -But you still didn't choose me. You should have chosen me. -What do you mean? GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): He means you have sworn your allegiance to me. Now, kill him before he destroys us both. -You're a sponge? -Kill him. He's fooling you. He's been fooling you all along. -Oh, god! -I am not afraid to use this. -He is not who you think he is. He Is really Isaac Leibowitz from your freshman track team. -[INAUDIBLE]? -Yeah, it's true. Come on out Naomi. -You remember me? -Naomi [INAUDIBLE]? -Well, he remembers. At least you remember the names of people whose hearts you've ripped out. -It was the sixth grade. -You were mean. -You're real? This is real? -We wanted to ease you into it. That's why, uh, we made up the whole Glintentica thing. -How long have you been doing this? -Well, uh, let's see. Uh, after you dumped me, my parents moved to Milwaukee. I heard you dropped out of high school and moved to Chicago. It took me a long time to find you. Luckily, you never questioned how you stopped having seizures after you dumped me, but then started having them again after you started back up with me. Or, uh, David as you like to refer to me. -None of this makes any sense. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Yes. [INAUDIBLE] -No, no, no, no. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Yes. Yes. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Yes. -No, no, no. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Stick it in me. -No, no, no, no, no. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): I'll see you next Tuesday. SETH: Ruth? GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): See you next Tuesday. SETH: Ruth. Ruth. Ruth, get in here. Something's wrong. -What happened? -I don't know. Is he dead? -No. -If he dies, this film could be his legacy. -Would you shut up and put your damn camera down? Call the ambulance. He is not waking up. MOSES (VOICEOVER): I don't get it. I've rewatched this in my head a hundred times so far. Is this how it's supposed to end? Is this what I've been preparing for? Or is this not real? Is this another seizure? Is it just a seizure? David? Can you hear me? David, wake up. David. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Secret cooter. MOSES: David? David, wake up. David, come in here. -Moses? What is this? Where are you? MOSES (VOICEOVER): I'm in the hospital. Come over here, there's not much time. Hey, mister. Good to see you. -You, too. Look, Moses, I don't really know what's going on right now. -David, listen. Glintentica is inside me now. I'm coming out of my coma, I can feel it. But I know that once I wake up, I won't be in control. She will. Since she's in my head, I have access to some of her thoughts, but she's blocking stuff from me. I don't know what her plan is, but she's going to try to trick you into believing that I'm myself. She's going to find my friends and she's going to trick them, too. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Who are you talking to? Get back, coma boy Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. -What's going on? Moses? GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Shut up, infidel. There is no Moses anymore. I've taken possession of his body. He is my avatar now. Glintentica shall ascend. -No. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Yes. There is nothing you can do to stop me. This has been 66 years in the making. Even as we speak, I am reborn. My exile is ending. The new covenant of Glintentica is upon you. Ha-ha-ha. -Bitch. I will stop you. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Au contraire, [INAUDIBLE] David. You and your kind are powerless against me. I'll do you one favor, though. -Oh, what's that? GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): I will warn you, you little faggot, that if you try and stop me, I' will take away the only thing that keeps you loving Moses. -Oh, what's that? GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Your pitiful, filthy, [INAUDIBLE], homosexual faggotry. -You-- GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): You have no idea what I'm capable of, David. Now I've got to get the hell out of here. Don't get in the middle of my stuff. You've been warned. -You bitch. You cunt. -[SIGH]. Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ, I can't believe that I sold out my roommate. [SIGH] That fucker Seth. I should have known I would never get any cash from that fudge packer. I was just starting to like Moses, too. The little fuck. Now he's in a goddamn coma and I am all a-fucking-lone. -Ruthy, shut the fuck up and calm down. -Oh my god. Holy shit. Oh. -Got a pen? -OMG. WTF. -So doll, how have you been? -You-- you're-- you're supposed to be-- you scared the piss out me, you bastard. What are you doing here? -I just got out of the hospital and figured you'd be here. I missed you, baby. I wanted to say hey. -Are you sure you're OK? I mean, you don't really seem like yourself. -Oh, muffin, I'm better than I've ever been. That last seizure was a doozy. I have you to thank for that. -I am so sorry about that. -Seriously, don't be. -Oh my god, this is so much better than it ever was with Aaron Parkinson, or any of his friends. -Well, I got to jet. I've got loads of work ahead of me. -Well, where are you going? When will I see you again? -Don't worry, cupcake. You'll be seeing more of each other than we ever did before. I won't let you stray far. Here, come to this address on Wednesday afternoon. I'll need your help. Wear a skirt. And forget your panties. -Sure thing, hot dog. -Later, s [PHONE RINGING] DAVID (ON PHONE): Hello. Hello? Who is this? RUTH (ON PHONE): Um, hey, David. It's Ruth. DAVID (ON PHONE): Ruth? Moses' roommate Ruth? RUTH (ON PHONE): Yeah. Um, listen. Moses is out of the hospital. DAVID (ON PHONE): He is? Is he OK? Is he staying with you? RUTH (ON PHONE): I don't know where he's staying. And yeah, I guess he seems OK. Different. Kind of straighter. DAVID (ON PHONE): Well, then where the hell is he, Ruth? RUTH (ON PHONE): Look, David. I don't know where he is. I just know that he asked me to meet him somewhere on Wednesday afternoon. And if you want to see him, then you should go too. He said he wanted help with something. DAVID (ON PHONE): OK. Yeah, look. Why don't you just email me the address? RUTH (ON PHONE): Right. I'll email it to you tonight, and then I'll-- I'll just see you on Wednesday. DAVID (ON PHONE): Yeah, see you. MEN: Pussy pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. -Disciples, I am well pleased. You have responded to my beacon with haste and devotion. And for that, Glintentica applauds and blesses you, for you are truly cleansed. And today, you will be ready to cleanse other souls. For today, we shall receive a visitation from our fourth brother. And here he is now. Welcome, David. -Uh, thanks. I guess. Ruth said you needed help with something? -It's just a little spring cleaning. So you remember your sister, Ruth, and your brother, Job? And you brother, what is your name? -Man, I totally have no idea. -And you? These are your brethren. Join them. In order to better prepare you for the task ahead, I have arranged a demonstration. Brother Job, have you secured a suitable subject? -Yes, brother, I have. -Retrieve him. -No. Get your filthy paws off of me, you brute. You icky, icky man. What in the name of Barbara are you people doing with me? You psychos are crumbling my couture. -Be still, abhorrent creature. To your knees. Brothers and sister, behold this poor excuse for a man. His mind is a chasm of depravity, a vacuum that sucks up nothing but filth. A cancer on masculinity itself, but we-- we have the power to rid him of this sucking void. By the grace of Glintentica herself, we shall purify him. David, get a well-wet sponge. Hold it over him. Now, concubine sister Ruth, have you worn what I asked you to wear? -Yeah, but this is-- -Prepare to lift your skirt. -What? No. -Do it. -Now, on the count of three, David, you squeeze the sacred sponge and baptize this mongrel. Ruth, you bathe this beast in the light of your [INAUDIBLE]. -My what? -I, uh-- I think he means your vag, Ruth. -Oh, Christ. -There is only Glintentica. -I am sorry. -Now, one, two, three. -Ew. -Now, sir. What is your deepest desire? -[GRUNTING]. Pussy. -Praise Glintentica. MEN: Praise her. Praise her. Praise Glintentica. -This, brothers and sister, is our charge. We must work as a team. Nay, a business to cleanse such languishing souls. The power of Glintentica is with us. We must become SoulMaids4U. David, don't let her get away. -Yes, brother. MEN: Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. -Ruth, you all right? -Get away from me you fucking fanatic. I mean, how could you just fall under his spell like that? I mean, that was some seriously [INAUDIBLE] shit, OK? I mean, did he just seriously make my cooter a fag converter? -Ruth, listen to me. Glintentica appeared to me, too. She's real. She's the one who made you snatch flash. Moses is seriously possessed and it's up to us to save him. -You know what? Save him your fucking self, David. OK? I mean, nothing personal. You know what? I think you're a great guy. Never had anything against you. I actually thought you were good for Moses. But this? I am so seriously done with this shit. OK, Moses shows up at my apartment the other night and-- [SIGH]. OK, don't be mad. -I won't. I won't, what is it? -OK, so Moses showed up the other night, right? And totally fucking comes on to me. And it's just like was back there. I mean, him all powerful and shit. And I was just like in a trance, you know? Like hypnotized. And it gets all touchy-feely and-- [SIGH]. He fucked me better than I've ever been fucked before. OK? I mean, it was totally-- it was like being raped, only better. I mean, it was just so intense. And I just couldn't believe how good-- Oh my god, you're mad. You're totally mad. Oh, David. I'm so sorry. -No, no, no. This is perfect. You have an in. -What do you mean? -Glintentica appeared to warn me to cooperate. She said she's turn me straight again if I interfered with her plan. I want him back, Ruth. I won't be able to love him like I want to if I'm straight. So I have to pretend like I'm converted. -Praise Glintentica. -I have to become a SoulMaid. -Oh, god. -Now, listen. She would never let me touch her. But you, she'd never suspect you. It's perfect. -What are you talking about? -I Googled her, Ruth. I found out what can destroy her. Listen, I'll explain. DAVID (VOICEOVER): 66 years ago, there was a discrete social club for gay men in the building in which you and Moses now live. It was called Glinny's, named after its proprietress, the sorceress, Glintentica. Now, Glintentica was a bit of a blue blood, so she didn't like the fags so much. But she tolerated them having profited so greatly from their decadence and disposable income. Eventually, however, her hate eclipsed her greed and she used her sorcery to conjure a clean demon, one who granted her the power to convert her clientele to heterosexuality via backroom baptisms. Glinny would have been successful if it hadn't been for an irresistible young drag king who found his way to the back room. When he entered, instead of baptising him, Glintentica could not resist the urge to seduce him. Now, if there's one thing a clean demon can't stand for, it's a hypocrite. And when the technically female drag king dove for clams in Glinny's homophobic poon, it greatly infuriated the clean demon and he banished her to another dimension. And after 66 years at the demon's dispensation, she returned to find Moses who was particularly susceptible to demonic possession because of his epilepsy. She prepared him for her arrival on June 6th, 2006. And now, she is using Moses' body to enact her vile ambitions. -The spell she's using might just look like she's setting up a small, culty cleaning service, but it's much more. She will destroy the entire gay population more quickly than you could imagine if she's allowed to continue. -You found all of this out from a Google search? -Yeah. Weird, huh? -Yeah, insane. So where do I come in? -Right. Well, if the website is correct, then the male body that Glintentica chooses to use as a disguise will grow a vagina someplace. Somewhere hidden. All you'd have to do is have sex with Moses again, find the hidden vagina, and lick the hell out of it. The clean demon wouldn't stand for that kind of girl-on-girl dyketastic action. He'd totally banish Glintentica again. But this time for good. She'd have to leave Moses' body and he'd be mine again like before. -So let me get this straight. You want me to go down on Moses' secret cooter to banish the spirit of the evil sorceress who is forcing him to convert homos to heteros? -Yeah. Gosh, it would really mean a lot to me, Ruth. Ruth? You with me here? -All right, I'll do it. Let's just get back there before Moses starts to get suspicious. -I know what you want? -Oh, no. No, I was just looking for my panties. -Silly girl, you're wearing them. But I think you should take them off. -Oh, it's kind of sore down there. So? -Oh, you really are a straight man. [MOANING] -Well? -Oh, Jesus. -Did you find it? -No. -How long does it take to find a goddamn vagina? -It's not as easy as you might think. In hindsight, maybe me ex-Aaron wasn't as stupid as he [INAUDIBLE]. -You don't seem to be trying very hard. What's that, like six times? -Eight. But who's counting? Do I look like I'm having fun? Oh, god. We're going to have to call this look the mission impossible. -Where are you going? -I am going to my room. I need some sleep. Look, geek boy I have been over every inch of coma boy's body eight times. There is no secret cooter. -Maybe you're not trying hard enough. I mean, did you try? -Yes. Ask for it by name? He loved it. Oh, yeah. And he sheds. -Um? -My tongue has been everywhere. Everywhere. Let me say it again. The boy has no vagina. -So Google is wrong? -Why do you have so much faith in Google? It's the fucking internet, you moron. You believe everything you find on there? -It can't be wrong. -Really? Well, if Glintentica is so homophobic and she's inside Moses' body, then how can she be having sex with me for two days straight? Maybe Google's not the all-knowing search engine you think it is. -Shit. I'm not an atheist, am I? I believe in Google. And if I believe in Google-- you keep him busy. -What? That's easy for you to say. -Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I've fallen in love with another man. I used to be straight, but then I met Moses. We fell in love right away. He's really perfect, except for weird seizures where he envisions this woman who's apparently, I don't know, inside of him somewhere. The spirit, this demon named Glintentica. -I am Glintentica. -Glintentica's like taken over his body, and I guess she wants to convert gay men to straight men. Moses has this secret vagina, I don't really know how to explain it. But you know, they've been doing this dance and these weird seances in his backyard. Maybe you've seen it or read about it in some of your scriptures or something? But, uh-- let me see if I can get this right. It goes, uh, vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Vulva, vulva. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Yeah, it's some really whack shit. I mean, stuff. Anyway, I feel like the best thing for us to do is pray to God for some guidance. That's why I came here to reconnect with God, try to help Moses so I can have him back. -Well, you're right to pray to seek God's help. And God will help you. And we can help God help you. You don't have to worry about the vulva dance or anything like that. [INAUDIBLE] to know what's true and right [INAUDIBLE]. -Exactly right, Father. That's exactly what we need to do. 20 minutes, Father? That's exactly what we need to do it. -Oh, yeah. Little doggy. Little doggy. -Uh, Ruth. Can I talk to you for a moment, please? Hi, Moses. -Hey, bro. How's it hanging? -Uh, fine. I'll bring her right back. -Whatever. Hey, babe, can you bring me a beer when you come back? -Snap out of it. Sorry, I've always wanted to do that. Look, we can call this look [INAUDIBLE]. -It's in his nose. -What? -The pussy. -It's in his nose. -No. -Uh, did you check there? -No. No, I'm not going to do this anymore. Hey, babe. Did you miss me? MOSES: Where's my beer? -[INAUDIBLE]. I forgot. I'll get it in just a minute, though. Just hold me. Oh. It just had to be the nose. I would have settled for an ear. MOSES: Huh? -Oh, I said, let me go get you that beer. -What are you doing? -David, get your ass in here. -Hey, get out of here. I'm not into that kinky stuff. What the hell? -What is going on? -I thought we needed all the help we could get. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): You think you can stop me? I am greater than you all. -Do it, Ruth. Lick out his nose. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Say what? -We know how to defeat you. Father. Father, pin down his legs. Ruth. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Stop. If you do this, David, you will lose him forever. -Fine. Turn me straight, at least Moses will [INAUDIBLE]. At least he'll be free from you. -David. -I mean it. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Silly boy. If you force me out of Moses' body, he won't go back to the way you knew him. I'll take everything with me. Every memory. He'll never remember you. -We'll make new memories. Ruth, do it. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): He won't even remember he likes boys. He'll be straight, a pussy hound for the rest of his life. -There are some things worse than being straight. You're one of those things. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Say goodbye to the love of your life then, faggot. -David? David? -I'm right here. -What's going on? Is she gone? -It's complicated. -David, it's horrible. I can't live like this with her inside me. -I know. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Ha. I knew you wouldn't do it. I'm greater than all of you. -What? [INAUDIBLE] sacrifice. GLINTENTICA (VOICEOVER): Ow. -What is the strongest flavor you have? -Well, today we have our red line blend. It's medium but spicy. -I have a bad taste in my mouth that I just can't get rid of. -M. Let me suggest our magical mint mochacchino. First, we start with two shots of espresso. We mix that up with some fresh mint blended together, a little chocolate in there. s-- oh, a fresh, delicious beverage. -David, it's Ruth. I'm at the coffee shop. And you need to call an astronomer because I have some news that is out of this world. Guess who is working here? Yes. Yes, I am sure it is him. And he is gay. Because he has a goatee, that's why. Listen, just-- just get your ass down here now. -Do you think he remembers anything? -What do you think? Go order something. -Right. You know what? I don't really drink coffee. -You don't have to drink it. -I'll have a-- uh-- I'll have a, uh, double espresso macchiato supreme. Tall. -Excellent choice. $8. -Right. $8, OK. -Thank you. -I meant order something from him. -Yeah, I know. I know. Do you mind? -Hey. -Uh, what would you like? -Yeah. Uh-- -Double espresso macchiato supreme tall? -Yeah. -$8. -If you're going to keep doing this, you are going to have to order cheaper drinks. -Just order a plain coffee. Aaron? -Hey, Ruth. -OMG. -I know. WTF. -Thirsty, aren't we? -Yeah. Can I just have a plain coffee? -Plain coffee. $2. -Thank you. -Hi, can I help you? -Uh, one tall skim latte. MOSES: Tall skim latte. Here you go. -Thank you. -You're welcome. You cannot be back for another cup already. DAVID: Cream? I'm David. -Hi. WOMAN: Hi, how are you? -Good. How are you? -Great, thanks. -We got this free drink coupon. -That'd be great. -OK. What's your name? -Eva. MOSES: Eva. E-V-A. -This isn't going so well. I'm going to have to [INAUDIBLE]. You stay right here, hot stuff. I'll be right back. This is going to help. -What? -Maybe this will jog his memory. -OK. So besides being a caffeine addict, you just happen to carry sponges with you? You're a strange one, but I'm not into sponges. -No, but you see this one, it has two colors. It's all about different color combinations. -That's nice. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Listen, dude. I'm flattered, but I'm straight. -Are you sure? -Hey, Mindy. Can you help this guy? Uh, folks, this section's closing, so if you want to feel free to head into the main dining room. You OK? -Yeah. Yeah. -Haven't you had enough? -No. -Is thus, uh, decoration or real? -Real, I guess. I'm a recent convert. -They let gay boys into church? -Some do. -I don't believe in God. I only believe in what's real. What's here. -And what's here? -Just tables, windows, people, the city, me, you. -Oh my god. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to mislead you. I really am straight. -Do you have a girlfriend? -What? -No, I'm sorry. You know I thought maybe-- -Yeah, look. I got to be closing. Uh, but you take care. Maybe you should switch to decaf. What are you going to do with all these sponges anyway? Well, have fun. I really hope you meet someone. You seem like a nice guy. -I mean, this is all [INAUDIBLE]. -David? David, right? That's your name? I feel like I've known you all my life. Isn't that weird. -Yeah. My name is Johnny. -Nice to meet you. -Uh, that-- that kiss. -Yeah. You've probably kissed a lot of guys before. -No. Just one. -Me, too. [MUSIC PLAYING]
