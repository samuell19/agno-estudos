Is he your dad? Your grandfather, then! He looks familiar to me. He's got a beard. Muslim Brother. He's Jewish. Jewish? Are you nuts? Be careful. You'll have trouble with the neighbors. He's my boss. Your boss? Imam, is nail polish ok during Ramadan? I don't see why not. What if it touches my skin? Ramadan is simple. Don't eat or drink between sunrise and sundown. Amel! Yeah? - Where's your lazy daughter? - What now? Look at this. How will she graduate with these grades? Seen her, Meriem? What? Am I Olfa's bodyguard now? What good are you? Give me a raise and I'll tell you. - She'll graduate! - It's your fault. You're too easy on her! ARAB BLUES Olfa! What're you doing here? What're you doing here? So you're back? Got a problem with it too? What the heck is this? On the run? Look at this mess! Trouble in Paris? You wouldn't be back otherwise. All Arabs are thugs in France. But I don't see you robbing banks. - I came here to work. - There's no work here. My office will be on the roof. Your office? In this hole? C'mon, what'd you do? Kill a patient? You're pregnant. - By a patient. - Some imagination! Then you're on drugs. Obviously. What's wrong? I thought you'd be happy. As if! Worst news today. I was counting on you so I could move to France. Go on your own. Think my parents will let me? This is mine, thank you very much. Can I keep this? Sure. You'll never last. They won't bother you, it's on the roof. Say something to your niece! Think she'll succeed? You actually think Arabs will pay to see her? "I'm sick, I need to talk." - Won't happen. - You'll see. Right. No crazies in my home. I have 3 daughters. One is child-bearing age with light skin. We're not in Europe here. We have God. We don't need that bullshit. I give you 2 weeks. You'll be begging me to drive you to the airport. Psychoanalysis? Give me a break. Move, brother! Don't take all night! Get moving! What the hell are you doing? Hands off! Even if you lick it clean, you won't get a cent. This isn't Coca Cola! What do you mean? Give me that! Everybody be quiet. Shut up! Enough! I'll walk the rest of the way. FREE TUNISIA - She's beautiful! - It's not right. Your father, my good friend, called and said you needed a practical car. You call that practical? She's like new! A Peugeot! The queen of the road! She's got so much space! Come see. You can fit your whole house inside! You women have tons of stuff. My wife too. - Forget your wife. - I'd love to! How can I drive it in all this traffic? She's practical, like new! There's a cassette deck. And the best Tunisian music. Do you know Kamel's Car? Kamel's car Hugs the road's curves Give me back my down payment. I want my money back. Money? And I want the rest of mine! Here's the keys. Say hi to your dad. Ask him why he never comes home anymore. Damn immigrant! She wants her money! Kamel's car Hugs the road's curves Zohra! Everything ok? Yes. I... I can't find my glasses. Goodnight. I just want to let you know I'm here. Wanna be my secretary? - Listen to me! - What? Is it my turn? You have no appointment? Then sit down! Sit down. Yes, young man. Let me wrangle them, I'll get to you. Just hang on. - You'll refer patients to me? - Sure. But don't expect miracles. I'll leave my card here. Take a number and wait. Trust me, everyone leaves Baya's place happy. Baya Center! No one leaves angry! Bit straight, isn't it? Straight? It's a blow-dry. Makes your hair straight. Straight as baguettes! No offense, but when you came in with your messy hair, you looked like a maid. And in those clothes you look like a guy. You hardly look like you came from Paris. Where do you live there? 17th arrondissement. Know it? Of course, I know Paris! Were you born there? No, I was born here. I left when I was 10. Know what? The moment you walked in, I pegged you for a local. I can spot 'em! Married? No. Why not? No reason. Perfect. Thank you. Baya, could I make an announcement? About what? I'm a psychoanalyst. I'm opening a practice here. I'd like to let your customers know. A psychoanalysis practice, here in Tunis? Yes. Think it'll work? Yes. People need to talk. That's for sure. And we Arabs talk a lot. My customers come here and talk a blue streak. But they leave with beautiful hair, like yours, or a new color... Or they do the hammam. They talk and talk, they fret. But they leave nice and clean! What do people leave your office with? It depends. Everyone leaves with something of their own. What does it cost? It depends. "It depends!" You're a broken record! Depends on what? Their financial situation. I'm flexible. We'll go into business. I'll send you customers. We split it 50-50. See all the neurotic messes in here? I'll make you a millionaire. That's not how it works. Girls! Quiet, everyone! Miss France has an announcement to make. Go on. Tell them. Right... So, it's kind of like a journey inside yourself so you can find a door to a happier you. If I take that trip with you, can you guarantee I'll have no more problems? No, I'm not saying your problems will disappear. Psychoanalysis changes their nature. Talking to someone about them brings a new perspective. Do you understand? Thanks. We'll try it, thanks. Me, me! Early estimates show Islamic party Ennahda in the lead with 40% of the votes, guaranteeing 60 to 65% of Parliament's 217 seats. License. Ah, France! What's France doing in a car like this? Get out. It's fine, let her go. First, a breath test. What do you mean? I never drink. You never drink? Tattoos, a Peugeot 404, and you never drink? C'mon, we don't have all night. - Can I do the breath test? - No, run along. Bye. Go on, blow. Where's the thing to blow in? Budget cuts. What? Budget cuts. Go on, blow. But... I can't. Blow. Harissa sauce? Sorry. Can I go? I'm hanging up now, Dad. No, I haven't changed my mind. Stop calling me every day to ask! I'm not coming back! - A lady's asking for you. - I'll call you back. Yoo-hoo! It's Baya! Baya, you can sit on the couch or in this chair. But that's my spot. Well, some welcome! Think you'll succeed if you treat customers that way? Not customers, patients. And I prefer we use vous in French. Vous? Why so formal? We can speak Arabic if you prefer. My French is excellent. I know, but then we must use vous. I have some questions, then I'll explain my approach. No. I'm leaving. I researched psychologists in Europe. They say things, they give people advice. They don't look down on people. You're so haughty. Post-colonial snob! Coming here today was a terrible idea! What's going on out there? I came first. You'd better not rush me. Your appointment will be Thursday at 3 pm. Be on time. Remember, she's French. Of course. Thank you. May God protect you. I'm exhausted, you know. No, please. I don't want to know. She's the doctor. I have enough problems of my own! So sorry. Honestly! So, you work in a bakery? Yes. But I don't like talking about myself. So what brings you? I need medicine, and a certificate for my boss. I'm not a doctor. I don't do certificates or prescribe pills. So what's the point? Why do you need a certificate? Because I'm sick. What do you have? I don't know. We could try to know. I don't want to know. I want a certificate. What're you doing here? Who are these people? I'm Ms. Selma's assistant now. Is that so? Is there a problem? Thought I'd clean your husband's puke all my life? These patients are nutcases! And as you know, I have a lot of experience with nutcases. What exactly are you doing? I'll keep my top, there's a breeze. Get dressed. It's not funny. You wanna play! Get dressed and go or I'll call the police! Sorry, I misunderstood. I heard about a French woman and a couch. You know? I want so many things. I want your jacket, for example. I want your couch. I want your house. I want your brain. Go on, continue. What's this game? Go on, what else? I want to know how to lie. Is that all? No, that's not all. But if I start telling you, it'll take years. Selma, be a good girl. Smoke at home. Not in front of the girls. This is my home, Amel. I can't figure this out... Mourad and I have made a decision. We're getting a lawyer. We're not happy about your practice. I won't leave. You're wasting your time. Shame. I was going to invite you out to celebrate. Invite us out to celebrate your departure. What's going on? Imam! Mourad, get the keys. Keys! How would you like a good hot meal to restore your strength? Nobody came or went? I told you, we saw no one. Go up to the house and lie down under the AC. What AC? It's broken. Imam, you must tell us what happened. Want some water? Hands off! It's bad for your diabetes! Bring the poor man some water! He's in shock, dehydrated! No need to shout, I'll do it. Since I've been here he never goes out, never talks. He doesn't seem to eat much. I'm sure it was a suicide attempt. Who are you? He shows clear signs of depression. Are you a doctor? Psychoanalyst. I just moved here and set up my practice. Really? Where? Upstairs, on the roof. You lived in France? Yes. Did your husband come too? I need a husband to live here? No, I was just... Wondering if I'm single? No, I was just curious. I'm teasing you. I'll be back to question him again. Funny to see you here. Sick of breath tests? The country's a mess. I go from guarding the border to cleaning government toilets. Anyway, I'll be going. Goodnight. Loverboy! Goodnight, ma'am. Salaam. For you. You shouldn't have. How are you feeling? Very well. If you need anything, I'm right here. I don't need anyone. Gnaouia? Thank you. I have everything. A husband who earns a good living. My business is doing very well. I have a nice car in my name. My son will be leaving soon to study in Canada. And my mother, she... I have a mother who... Why'd I bring her up? It's not important. I've come to see you because I can't seem to rid myself of an urge to vomit. Sometimes I have this bitter taste in my mouth for days. Then it goes away. Baya, can you explain the connection between your mother and your nausea? There's no connection. The connection... It seems absurd, but... That's all for today. It was barely 10 minutes. You were 20 minutes late. What? I told you, I had to fire the girl who was robbing the till! What was I supposed to do? Let her do it? Wait until my session was over? No problem. We'll carry on next week. You can leave the money on the console. For 10 minutes? I explained the rules, Baya. True. There are no secrets between us. Sorry, you can't stay. Wait outside. She can tell you about it if she likes. Listen to the lady, son. Be a good boy. I won't be long. He sticks to me like glue. A real leech. You still won't give me your name? Is this place wiretapped? I'm sure they hid mikes. Wait a minute... Are you a Mossad agent? Good evening. May I? He opened up when I mentioned your theory. I told you. He got defensive and denied it. "How dare you? I'm a God-fearing imam." You know, I respect your diplomas. Truly. But you don't seem to understand how things work here. It was just my opinion. It's none of my business. I promise you, there's a lot you don't know. Even though you look like a Parisian intellectual. Do I? Just a little. So what don't I know? Can I see your license? My what? Permit. Your license to practice freely. I don't have one. A Freudian slip? You've been practicing for a few weeks. You told me so yourself. Who cares about a piece of paper? Who'll come check? The government has better things to do. Right, right. You think we're savages here, don't you? In a jungle. We have laws too. You must respect them. Just a minute. Be right back. That should cover it. You'll have to stop practicing in the meantime. I even saw a sorceress in Tataouine. I heard she worked miracles. But when I got back, it was worse. I started dreaming about Putin. I'd dreamt about Saddam Hussein, al-Assad, Mohammed VI... All Arab dictators. I just don't get it. Why Putin now? Why? Can you do something? Can you get it out? Open up my skull and get this shit out of my head! It's always me kissing them! What have I done to God? The worst part is I like it! I like it. Mark my words, if I dream about that bastard Bush, I'll jump out a window! That simply cannot happen. HEALTH MINISTRY Madam? Excuse me. Madam! Hello. Excuse me... Pardon me, miss. - I... - You're French, right? Yes. You know about lunch breaks in France, right? Sorry, I'll wait. My birth certificate... my proof of citizenship... certified copies of my diplomas... And the originals, too. Grab me that bottle of water on my coworker's desk. Thanks. They went heavy on the harissa today! Everything ok? Sure. You know, I’m from Nabeul. We're spoon-fed harissa from birth. They shovel it in. After that, you behave. Don't worry, I'll be fine. I meant my application. Will it go through? Insha'Allah. Please tell me, yes or no? I told you: God willing! Say! Do you like lingerie? Pretty, right? Bras are 20 dinars. Feel it! It's padded. And the panties... 10 dinars. For you, 30 a set. Top quality. Look. - Don't tell anyone I'm here. - Olfa! You gotta help me, please! What'd you do this time? Olfa, a plague upon you! - Seen my daughter? - No, I just got home. I swear, she's driving me insane! What'd she do? I'm ashamed to tell even you! Gimme a smoke. Tell me. We just spent an hour at the principal's office. They kicked her out! We had to pay them not to call the police! What'd she do? What'd she do? Listen to this. During Islamic education class, she lifted her shirt and flashed her breasts to the teacher. I raised her as best I could. Taught her manners. Kept her away from the bad crowd. Taught her Islam. Preached the Quran. What will I do with her? If Mourad hadn't written that check, she'd be arrested! I'll call her. I'm sure she'll talk to me. But don't threaten her. Promise me. I don't want anyone to hurt her. What a shitty life. You're so lucky. Here. No husband. No kids to bother you. You drink when you want. You smoke when you want. You go out. - You have lovers! - Stop. Pure fantasy. Tell me! Think I'm naive? I can see. You don't know how lucky you are. If I were you... Stop right there! A patient is coming. I'll call when I get news. Why so secret? - There's nothing to tell. - There must be! - You can trust me. - I know. Freedom sure smells good! Where'd you find that? Stop digging through my stuff. I took it to a pal who copied it. You're a local now anyway. Tell me, how you can wear the veil and flash your breasts to an Islamic teacher? First of all, the teacher's a perv who ogles us. Second of all, this isn't a veil. It's a cover-up. That hick Baya did it to me! I showed her a picture of Rhianna and voila! Why'd you come back? Everyone dreams of getting the hell out. You must be kidding. They can't even dye hair here. There's so much to do here. There's nothing to do! In Paris I had 2 colleagues in my building and 10 on my street. I wasn't needed. You left your life behind! No boyfriend? No. Why not? Why? I don't want a man. I like solitude. How can you say that? Children are important. I want children. Do what you like. And your mom? Still angry at her? I never was angry. Are you doing this for her? I'll tell your mom before she calls the army. Can I sleep with this tonight? Enough. Give it back! Forget it! I'm sleeping here. No! Now I understand why the patients lie down. You can open up in this position. It wouldn't work with our hard benches. Maybe that's why we Arabs don't open up. Just a question of comfort. You read the Quran? Are you surprised? No. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. You wonder what a single, tattooed, probably godless woman is doing with a Quran. You take me for a fool. Beards are back in fashion. At least he looks friendly. He was anything but, in my opinion. Thanks again for the food. Madam Selma, may I have your personal number? If I get anxious at night, can I call you? I'll pay you for it. I know it's your job. We see each other 3 times a week. That's plenty. And it's going well. Rest assured. I know, but it's not enough. I have so much to say. That's all for today. I'll see you out. You're too hard on me, Madam Selma. I went through my sister's clothes again. I slapped myself! I stole more clothes. We'll continue next week. Ok, goodnight. She's so strict with me. You too? Very strict. It's too much. - Take care. - Thanks, you too. Hope he doesn't swallow a jar of pills. Without a license, it'd be hard to explain. - You don't take me seriously. - Sure I do. Just follow the rules. They're processing my application. The secretary assured me. I can't figure out if you're naive, idealistic or stupid. A bit of all three. Please, let me do my work. You could go to prison. We have rule of law here now. Rule of law? And I'm the one who's... what was it again? Naive, idealistic and stupid? - Find another source of income. - Income? This is my income. So you're risking prison for fritters? It's a currency like any other. Sweet, thank you. You told me to come today. I know. But Mr. Belhadj is still absent. Sick leave. I don't know what sickness. What can I do? I'm risking prison. May God protect you. It was the first evening I spent without wanting to slap her. And I wrote down my dreams, as you advised. I dream a lot right after my 4 a.m. insomnias. Last night I dreamt I committed murder. I was terrified, I knew I'd be arrested. But oddly, I woke up feeling serene, as though I'd just watched a sunset. Selma? Yes? What's wrong? Continue. You seem strange. Strange? You're looking at me normally, it's strange. That's all for today. Saved by the bell. We have to stop for a while. I have to close temporarily. A few weeks. For administrative reasons, nothing to do with you. If you need more space, come to my salon. I'll free up the waxing room. It's more complicated than that. What's wrong? Don't worry, it'll be alright. We have to stop for a while. I have to close temporarily. A few weeks. For administrative reasons, nothing to do with you. Sorry, I'm just leaving! Get going, scram. Madam Selma, you can't abandon me! It was a misunderstanding, sorry! I was lost back then! You're not even my type. Are you ill? You were at the pharmacy? - Are you dying? - I have to go! We must talk now! Don't go! Madam Selma, please! No, Raouf! - How'd you find me? - I followed you. We must talk. I told you I'd find a replacement. No thanks! I only want to talk to you. If we keep talking, I'll get in trouble. - Understand? - No you won't, I'll protect you! Seriously! I do Kung-Fu. What? Remember I'd forgotten my first childhood memory? This is a bad time. No sessions in the car. We're in the car. I put on a checkered dress. We played all afternoon. I remember like it was yesterday. No, Raouf! Get up! And who ruined everything? Damn that bastard! The gardener! Please get up. - Sit back up. - No, no! He told my dad. That's all I remember. I'm asking you to sit back up! I must find the dress! Please help me, don't let me down. Please, Madam Selma. Don't let me down. Yeah? Hello. Ah, Selma. Excuse me. I'm continuing with certain patients. I'd like you to turn a blind eye. They had no one before you. Don't worry, they'll be fine. You don't understand. Right, I'm just a cop. If I continue, will you turn me in? I'll do what I have to do. Selma... Wait. I hope you understand my position. Without rules, we're heading straight for disaster. I understand. Wait, please. Would you like to go out sometime? What do you mean? No rush, whenever you like. Hang on... You came out to ask me on a date? Yes. How clueless can you be? I ask you to look the other way so people don't suffer, and you ask me out for ice cream? You can just say no, I'm a big boy. You're twisted, more like. Is that so? Shit! - You're late. - What's up? I didn't know. Me neither. Will you explain? Don't like him? Is it the hair? What's the deal? We'll marry and move to Paris or London. He was born in Lyon. So? It's cool, he's French. We won't have to drown. London is better. - Are you nuts? - Paris must be dead. If you're here. You can't marry him. - Why? - You know why. Because he's gay? Good eye. No wonder you're a shrink. We worked it out. We'll live our own lives. I thought you were open-minded. "I'm a shrink. I live alone. Fuck the family." But you judge too. Stop eating all that sugar! Go in the living room. You can't let her do this. He promised to cut his hair. She can't get married, it's a joke! You better leave her alone. This one's interesting too. Thank you. Your wound is almost healed. Which wound are you referring to? The one you inflicted on yourself. You talk a lot for an analyst. Did we establish a framework? I just wanted to make a little cut. I don't know what got into me. I'd read an article about young Egyptians cutting their own zebiba to show their faith. It takes 50 years of praying on a mat to get that mark. The article said they cut their own foreheads, then rubbed garlic on the cut to darken the wound. At the Mosque, they scolded me for not having a beard. Or a zebiba. I said, "Seriously? "You can't judge me for having no beard "or mark on my forehead." They insulted me and threw me out like a bum. Know who replaced me? Fethi. The butcher from my old village. They brought Zohra into it. They claimed that if I were a good Muslim, my wife wouldn't have left me. She watched Turkish soap operas all the time. I should've paid more attention. One day she started crying. She cried for a month. Constantly. The hero of her favorite series had died in an episode. While the Salafists at the Mosque were kicking me out, she left. It was the day Ben Ali fell. She went to Turkey. I haven't heard from her since. I lost everything that day. I just wanted to mark my forehead to be like the others. I didn't want to die. You have nothing better to do? Let's start over. Do men come to your house? Men and women. The report says you ask them to lie down. Not always. Speak Arabic. - She doesn't understand. - I do. It also says you were trained by Mossad agents. Mossad? What's that mean? I don't know. It says that. What's Mossad mean? They're the ones who killed John Kennedy. Is that right? Go back to sleep, Salah. Madam Selma, it also says you studied in Israel. And your grandpa was a rabbi, his picture hangs in your office. No. It also says you use the word... "sex" in front of women and the elderly. Sex means prison. Sex is a dirty word. She wore us out. So stubborn. Go have lunch. We'll eat and be back! Give me that. Here, this too. Salah, get some air. Mustn't upset you. Happy now? Did you have fun? Only 4 hours in custody? Don't want me overnight? Think I landed you here? People ratted you out. I'm just doing my job. Think you're so important? You're worse than Olfa. No respect! I only want to do my job. No one's stopping you. Just don't do it here. It's not our thing, understand? Go home. Nobody needs you here. Ok? You'll only get hurt. Mourad! During the revolution, some of us formed a group to protect the neighborhood. We drank to pass the time and forget our fears. Then I couldn't stop. I drank to go to work, to unwind, to drive, to look at my wife, to cope with my kids. You know, Selma... I'm scared. I'm stuck. I'd give anything to get out of here. Give my daughters a better future. There's nothing left. It's a desert. Dark, obscure. It's a powder keg. One spark, and it's over. Yes, Amel? Don't worry, everything's fine. The girls are playing. Selma's here. All is well. Just a skid, no big deal. Yeah, ok. So? I've got great news. Thank god! Hang on. The committee meets on Monday. My colleague says the application's complete, but missing something. So it's not complete. It is! It's complete, but missing something. - Missing what? - Hang on. You need a letter of recommendation from a senior Tunisian official. What? A letter of recommendation from a senior Tunisian official. I got it. So how do I get one? It's simple. See a senior Tunisian official and ask for a letter of recommendation from a senior Tunisian official. I'm sure you'll find one. Insha'Allah! Are you deaf? I've been shouting! - What the hell? - I ran away. - I'm never going back. - Unbelievable! Answer me. You'll get me in trouble! What'd you do now? Haroun told his parents, and they told my parents. He's weak, he ruined everything. Imagine! He told them he likes boys! He didn't want to live a lie. Very clever. Now he won't even live at all. Where are we going? Want me to drop you off? - I just... - Shut up! Are there no more laws in this country? A pervert got into the hammam! We went to scrub "her" and discovered "she" was equipped! Equipped! Can you imagine? That way! In the back, to the left. There. Hey! Come out, brother. This is the women's hammam. Get this shithead out! It's hot in here! Come out. - Why? - Come out! - But I'm a woman. - Come out. I'm a woman! You get out! I'm a woman! You get out! Scram! Get out! - I just want to talk. - No! Get out! I'm gonna show you what for! I won't leave! Don't come near! I won't touch you. - You're gonna hit me! - I won't touch you. Wait. I know this guy. Where from? I saw you at Selma's. - You know Madam Selma? - Yes. - Are you a patient? - Yes, I am. - Sit down, let's talk. - No! - I only talk to Madam Selma! - We'll call her. Can't you see the state I'm in? - Come out. - You won't hurt me? No, I promise. - Don't hurt me! - Come on out. What's wrong? Is that the baker? Let us through. Let us through. Help me here. It's the baker. Wait for me here. Don't mention your mother. Don't mention politics. He's tired, so please. Baba? Baba? I brought someone you'll be thrilled to see. Sit up, Dad. Hello, Grandfather. How are you? Feriel? No, it's Selma, her daughter. Selma? You found your way to our house? Sure. You don't love us, do you? Sure I do. She loves us, Dad. But she's been very busy these past few years. Overwhelmed. I see. What do you do? I've been living in Ez-Zahra for a few months now. Are you married? Married? Look at her arms. So... why? I'm working here. As a doctor, I hear? Psychoanalyst. - What? - I quit med school. And you prescribe medicine? No. So you're a witch! No, not really. Listen... I came to ask a favor. A favor? Yes. I opened my practice. I'm still awaiting my license. I need help with the Health Ministry. Can't you manage on your own? He's tired. No, I'm not tired. I can help you. - Really? - Yes. - I know someone. - Really? - Yes. - Fantastic! Hang on. Him. He can help you. You can trust him. You're kidding me. No. It's over, he's gone. What? He's gone. His regime is over. No! He still here. You didn't tell him? I couldn't. I'll talk to him tonight. Don't worry. Get some rest. - I'll come see you again. - Let's go. He's tired. I'll make you some kamounia. Want his help or not? Could you slow down? We're in no rush. You might not be, but I am. With all your diplomas, you didn't know you needed a license? Give it a rest. Even I know that! Even my sisters know. Even Meriem and the guy selling pretzels on the street! Shut up! Speed all you like, I don't care. We'll croak out here! No internet, no water, no nothing! The Salafists will find us! A car will come. I'm not getting in any car! Don't you get it? What're you doing? Salaam. It's beautiful. What is it again? I won't crack. Everyone wants me to crack. They want me to return to my little life in Paris. But I'll tell you because you don't care... I don't know why I'm here. All I know is that I want to be. I feel good here. True, at first, I thought I wanted to fix my mother's pain or avenge my father's exile. But that's not it. It's visceral. I feel like I heard a calling. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm tired. I won't crack. They need me here, don't they? Yes. Yes, of course. I'm doing everything I can. Yeah. Sure, sure. Bye. Selma! - Nothing for me today? - Nope. I demand to see a higher-up. I won't leave until I do. I'll go on a hunger strike. Are you ok? May God protect you. Listen, I got a delivery of genuine silk scarves from Turkey! I'll show you. They wear them in the Sultan's Harem! They're beautiful, look! We cleaned the cylinder and fixed the clutch. She's like new. Drive safe. SELMA DERWICH Psychoanalyst/Psychotherapist I beg you. - I've got money. - You make me need therapy! That's all for today. I'm glad you're working again, but how long can this go on? See you Thursday, Baya. Same price? Put it in the glove compartment. Not to complain, but this is less comfortable, less private. Alright, already! See you Thursday. - Same spot, same street? - Yes. What's this circus? The only cop on duty in this country! - Are you serious? - Do I have a choice? - I can't help you if... - I don't need you. - If I'm forced to fly to Paris... - Forced to fly? You'll be in a lot more trouble than that. - Start the car. - Get out. - Start. - People are waiting! - Start! - Get out of my office! I parked here to pressure the Ministry. - Pressure them? - Yes. - Talk to her. - Talk to me. Why were the curtains closed? We were talking. She was just leaving. Did you two get married? Far from it! Why were the curtains closed? Give it a rest! She was just leaving! Prostitution is illegal. Even with a French passport! - How dare you? - Show some respect! Lower your voice! You show respect! Don't yell at her. - Must be his girlfriend. - She paid him. Taking bribes, Naïm? - Let's get inside. - Don't touch me! I'm getting inside! - My session! - Stand back. Stand back. You wanna mess with me? What happened? You left me with Jackie Chan! Please give me my file. I'm going back to Paris. - Already? - Yes. So you won't need this letter? What is it? With your hunger strike and all, I had no time to give it to you. - The committee convened. - I thought... Then Mr. Belhadj's replacement gave me that. Anyway... Happy? I won't see you anymore? No. Shame. I liked talking to you. What do you do? I never asked. My name is Ferid. Ferid Oueslati. I'm 42 years old. I spent the last 5 years in prison because I opened my mouth once in my garden. I don't remember what I said. But they heard everything. "That's all for today!" I pay her to say "That's all for today!" Are you consulting her too? You're early. This is no hammam. There are rules! Come on time, leave on time! No overlapping! You better never say you saw Baya here. Did you see me here? Have you ever seen me here? Good boy. Get out, I'm not ready! Get out, I said! I have no makeup on! You're beautiful. Magnificent. You're not so tall. You're tiny. No, look. I forgot I married a little dumpling.
