Are you sure this is the best way? Gold will remain gold. It can't be hidden from people with ill intentions We're doing a monk's duty. Hey. Let me go. Parn. Let go of me. Por, where's my money? Where's the money I asked you to keep? I threw it away, son of a bitch. You threw it away? What did you say, bastard? Come here. You come here. - Let go of me. - You come here. Shit. Let go of me. Shut up. Don't you know the money you threw away was seven million, not seventy baht. Let me go. How did you threw it away? Son of a bitch. Bastard. That was unnecessary, Singh. Por if we can't get that money how could mom be able to see again? The cops were chasing my ass. If I didn't hide it Would mom ever going to get the money? Bastard What a wimp. Where is the money? Shit Hurry up, big sister. Hurry up. - what's taking you so long? - Big sister, what are you doing? hurry up. Come on, deal. Deal. Let's play today. Bad shuffling. Just a minute. One more time. You motormouth. Don't ask for my feet. My lucky day. How many hands? How much? -Two hands. Come on. -Two hands. Stop talking. I've brought my lucky charm. I don't have to cross my fingers. Captain. Police Police Stop. I'll handle it. Hey, I've paid. What more do you want, huh? I've paid on the table, under the table, even under the bed. What's this? I get a traffic ticket? Upstairs please. Come on. Get back to the game. Officer, you want to play a game? Five or ten baht. Come on, let's have some fun. Hmm… Pree. What is it? Do you want to sleep on prison bed tonight? Hurry up. What are you waiting for? Get out. What. I haven't got paid. Shit. Where's Singh? How would I know? You're a cop and you don't know. How would a hooker like me know? What kind of an informant are you? Not knowing where your damn husband is? I've told you everything I know, captain. Who doesn't want money? His partners and him just shot and killed two police officers. Whenever you see him, beat him up, kill him. Asshole. You two don't go wimpy on me. The cops won't find us. You just killed two of them last night. Won't you just shut up. If I didn't, your ass would be sitting in the slammer right now. I'm so freaking grateful that you gunned down the cops in front of my mom's house. Her son was the one bringing trouble home. The cops laid in wait for you there everyday, don't you know? How could I know? Running away again, bastard. Hey. I'm getting confused. Is it this temple? Last time I was here, I didn't see this hall. Is this the wrong temple? Hey, there. This is it. I recognize that monk. I think the money is underneath here. You said the money is underneath? Money, the money is underneath? Right. The money is under this hall? Son of a bitch. If the money is really under this hall, we'll have to dig it up. Could you do it in one day, Singh? Just seize this temple and dig it up. This is a temple, not a farm. Don't you want money? We have to stay here without being noticed. Three thieves in the temple. How do you want to disguise yourself? As the gable apex, its edges, or the wall? Monks. Did you have a brainfart? Think about it. All the cops in the area are looking for us. Shit I'll go along with your brainfart. No way. If you want me to stay, I'll stay. But not as a monk. Hell, no. You be the monks. It's all your money. My money... is your money. Hey, a monk. Good timing, father. Ordain us. Ordain. We want to be ordained. Not me. If you're not a monk, you'll stay here to help us. Think it over. The monk’s robe won’t be able to cover you for long. Singh, that's a monk. Like I haven't done it. I'm curious if an old monk, still cares for his life. Hey. Father, please. This bastard is really going to shoot. Don't let things get worse, please father. We're just running away from troubles. Father, I beg you, please. What the hell are you looking at? Never saw a monk before? I've realized that no suffering equals those of the five bodily aggregates. How could I extinguish this suffering? That's yours. Por, take this one. This one's mine. Let's go dig. You moron. You start digging now, everyone will know we're thieves. So what? Can't you wait until people are asleep? Ok. You three, I need to talk to you. I told all the monks here that you two are on pilgrimage. I'm really grateful, father for giving us a perfect sanctuary. I want you to adhere to the rules of the temple, just like other monks. Including monk's duties. I don't want anyone to suspect about what you are doing here. Who's the boss here? It's called the abbot. This will be your chamber. I want to ask you to realize that you are in monk's robes now, even though you're not real ones. Please behave appropriately. Is that all? I'll get some sleep now. Such a grouser. Father, you had to violate the monk's precept for not lying, didn't you? Hurry up. You're still here? Asked for my foot once before. You'll get one now. Hey, I think it must be here. Are you sure? Right here for sure. How long is it going to take? I really want to kill you. It's all because of you. Hurry up Hey What is it? Nothing. Just a dog barking. I should've kicked him to death. Singh, Singh. Look. Shit. It's almost dawn. - We'll continue digging tomorrow. - Go, get out of here. Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh. Time to wake up. What? You don't sleep around here? The rooster hasn't crowed yet. Why is your face so dirty? Stop asking. Just say whatever you are here for. I'm going back to bed. No more sleep. Acting like a fake monk. You have a duty to do, don't you? Acting like a fake monk. Fake monk? What's my duty, huh? Tolling the bell. I have to toll the bell? Why don't you do it yourself? It's your duty. Here. What is this? The monks here have to be woken? Such lazy monks. Wake up. These novice monks. I told them to clean up. I'm paying homage to the sublimity of Buddha. I'm paying homage to the sublimity of Buddha. To the Teaching which Buddha expounded so well, The Lord Buddha, the Perfectly Enlightened and Blessed One I wonder what you do at night, not getting sleep. A monk without conscience will sully his robe. One rotten fish makes others stink. Are you a fish or a monk, Sayan? Yantaro Bhikkhu, not Sayan. That name sounds familiar. Don't get in a scandal when you grow up. Newly ordained monks? They're on pilgrimage. You pale-face, come down here. Hurry up. Here. When the monks arrive, you bring them these two alms bowls. Is this how monks eat? It's the tradition here. Father Chuen started it. Then the abbot thought it was a good practice. Villagers like to see it. So all the monks do it now. Why do they do this for? Do you know anything? Maybe it's like receiving food offerings. Father Chuen told me that food offerings help polish people's manners. Help teach people not to be drunk all day like someone around here. Teu, what do you mean? Kept me starved. To eat for pleasure, you'll be disappointed. Eat to live, don't live to eat. I don't live for you either. Hey, you ok? Come on. Bear it. Please continue, father. Almost done. Ok, you're done. I'm fearless now. - You go with me. - Where? To test this tattoo. You'll take me to die. What are you talking about? Hey. I'm fearless now. Want to test? - Son of a bitch. That's enough, Dum. Shit. - What is it? Do you want a tattoo too? If it can protect my life, I want one too. I don't know what you three did, but I want you to realize. Buddhism is too sacred to be damaged. You know well that we're here with ill intentions. Why did you still ordain us? That was not a proper ordainment. What you have done is called robbing the yellow robe. Buddhism doesn't inhibit bad people from being ordained, in wish that they will be polished. I'd like to see you three reformed and leave this temple better people. You can try, father, if you think it's possible. What now? Craving for a drink? Shit. Prison wasn't this bad. I say we give up this monk sham. Let's finish digging up the damn money tonight. Or you and I will still have to walk and eat like this for a few days. If it was not for your brother, I won't be having this buzzard's luck. And which son of a bitch tried to trick me? Calm down. It's me. Hey. You move your rotten toe, and I know what you're thinking. Bastard. Buddy, as if you were so trustworthy, with the bag-switching trick of yours. Filling the bags with ballots they hired you to burn. You want me burning them for you? If I didn't do that, you would've run away with the money. Let's call it even. And you never told me the hirer was in for the cut. Don't mention him. I hate his guts. But if he's supposed to get half of it, how much would we have left? Just dig up the money and we'll split it half way. Aren't you afraid of him? If I can't stand over his dead body, it means I'm already dead. Father, father, help me please. Father, help please. Feung. Stay still. Sshhh…. Father. Wait. Father. Stay calm. Wait. Keep still. Don't move. Father. She was bitten by the snake. Give me a hand. What. Here, let me do it. I think we'd better take her to the hospital. Go. Hurry up. Take this in case you need it. Take it. Don't let her die. Quickly! Hey, father called for us. What is it? Funeral. What does it have to do with me? Aren't you a monk in this temple? Sorry, I want to sleep. What about me? I don't care. Oh, Buddha. Here, Dum. They don't have any children? They had a son, but he never cared for them. Sent them an ATM card maybe ten years ago. - Has anyone… - Anyone told him yet? I don't know. Probably not. How could he know? What a shame. He won't have a chance to see even his parent's ashes. Oh, Buddha. What is the father trying to tell us? If something happens to us, how would mom live? Nothing is going to happen to us. Who knows? Death might be creeping up on us as I speak. Hey, Singh. If we ever find the money. What are you going to use if for? My getaway. You? I want mom to see. I never did anything for mom since I ran off with you. Por. You've come back. Mom. Where have you been for so many days, Por? Mom. I got a job driving a car upcountry. Come sit this way, mom. Come with me. I want to be ordained. You're already a monk. You're early. Want to be a monk too? Parn. What? Hey. Shit. We're in trouble. Singh. Go. Quickly. What the hell were you doing? Nnn…nothing. Nothing? What are these tools for? Hey, you said the monks were all asleep. Greeting, father. Greeting my ass. What the hell is going on? Father. Father. What is going on, huh? Let go of me. Bastard. Shit. Made me sweat. Hey, I think they're here to rob a Buddha image. They're not here for my money? You must've woken the whole temple. Right there. I knew it. Dum. Asshole. Shit. You ungrateful thief. I let you stay here, and you dare to steal. Good. Should we call the police to arrest them? Good. Should we call the police to arrest them? Please, father. I won't do it again. Better not let the police involved. Just kick him out of the temple. But he dared stealing the Nak Prok Buddha. Hank has realized his wrongdoing. He's better than someone who hasn't. We don't have to have police around here. Better not make a scene. Get out of here. I'll let you handle this case. I thank you three for keeping an eye on the temple. Hey, Parn. Look! Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone now. Bitch, I told you to pick up the phone, not doing your nails. I thought you were being possessed. Possessed my ass. I'm being upset. Don't make me explode. Hello. Ware at your service. Is Pueng there. Pueng? From whom? It's me. Don't you remember? Shit. It's Singh. Pueng, quickly. Your thief husband. Hello. Daring. Singh, where in the freaking hell are you? Speak to me. I'm a monk now. A Monk? Listen! If you're a monk, a hooker like me could be a prime minister. Stop joking around. Seriously, where the hell are you? I'm not kidding, Peung. I'm a monk at Pa Lom Temple. Ok, ok…you're not kidding. And uh, father, why did you have to be ordained at a temple that far away? It's only 3-hour ride. Could you come see me? Right now. Hey, I don't do delivery service. You want to do it? Help yourself. Bastard. Don't drag me to hell with you. Hey Pueng. What now? I'll tell you something. I feel you're under a bad sign. You should start making merits. Asking the gods for good luck. It might bring you something good. If good means looking like you, I'll pass. What the hell is wrong with him? No need to hurry. We've just finished the first round… Kao. Yeah, it's me. Why are you here? Who did you tell my money truck plan to? What money truck? I didn't know nothing. Who could it be if it's not you? I don't know. I didn't tell no one. You lying bitch. If you didn't why did your husband beat me up like this? I don't know nothing what he did. He ran away with the booty. Why should he tell a hooker like you? Why not, a hooker wants money too. You die. Girls, help me teach him a lesson. Go inside. Wait, sis. Do you have any idea why a thief wants to become a monk? What else could it be? He's running away from the police. Sis, I quit being a hooker. Wait, Peung. What the hell? Great, let me join in. PA LOM TEMPLE Uh… monk. Father. Peung. Singh… Shit. You're really a monk. I thought you were bullshitting me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, father, for yelling at you in the telephone. Son of a bitch. How stupid could you be? Did you really call for your wife to come? And you're so holy, huh? After all you've done, what do you have to fear? Buddhism will never degenerate. Its core will forever be pure. It's the people who get degenerated. I don't want your wife to know about the money. How could she know? She spends her day getting high. She's absolute a nitwit. I wish she doesn't know. Father used to tell me, so many men have been wrecked by women. Jeez, your holiness. Wasn't it a woman who pushed you into this world? Dum. Dum come here Quickly What the hell are you looking for? I thought, I thought I saw a woman in your chamber. Tomorrow, toll the bell for me, and bring me my breakfast. You've taking a leave? - It's none of your business - Ok, ok, sir. I'm going. I'm here, darling. Shit. Singh, what the hell are you doing? - I've been craving for it. - You're wearing a monk's robe. Bastard. Bitch. You're getting on my nerve. Here. I'm taking it off. What a jerk. Can we do it now? Get out. Don't do it, father. Father, what father? I'm a fake monk. I just shaved my head and put on the robe. I thought you've turned the corner. Singh, get out Singh. Come on, you're here already. I don't think we're going to dig tonight. What a perfect match made in hell. A ghost and a coffin. Shit. - You sure? - Yes It's sinful to lie. I know. I'm not lying. You bastard Singha. You bastard What are you hitting me for? You jackass, you're dragging to hell with you. You're such a jerk. You bastard Look at you. You look like an ogre asking for food. Oh, Buddha. Ruined my mood. Ouch… Where is father Singh? Uh…he's… Maybe he's sick. He said he had a fever. Father Parn, you take care of him. make sure he's ok Yes, sir. You What's in your mind? There're some questions I can't figure out. Father, can religion really turn people from bad to good ones? Yes and no. What makes you think religion can't do it? Buddha said people's conscience can be divided into four kinds of lotus. Unsubmerged lotus, lotus on water level submerged lotus and lotus stuck in mud. To polish some people to be a good person. It means, some people can be polished. But some can't. To which group of lotus do you think I belong, father? do you think I belong, father? Ask yourself. Which lotus do you want to be? Sayan. Yes? What is it? Evil deeds are easy to do. Good deeds are hard to do. Like when you have to lie. Right, father? Being a monk is not easy as it seems. Even if I had tried to rectify what I've done, nothing seems to get better. My friends and I caused you troubles. What did you do that made you ran to this temple? We robbed a money truck. Where do you hide the money you robbed? Who said I robbed it? - Shut your mouth. - Why The guy you beat up came back to beat me up. What did it have to do with you? Kao said he was going to rob a money truck and give me a cut. And you shithead had to rob it first. So my money is with you, and I've come to get it. It has nothing to do with you. Why? - Go home. Go. - I'm not going. Give me my money. Give me my money, asshole. Shut up. Bastard. I want my money. Money is just an illusion. Would you exchange your integrity with an ethereal illusion? Do you think it's worth it? But my mom has to be able to see again, father. There are times in our life when we have to choose what to do or not do. Do you remember me, father? I came here once before. Son of a bitch. You are the man from that night. I came back for the money. It's in this hall, father. Father Singh Father Singh What? Who's that? You have done the most sinful conduct. You must leave monkhood and this temple immediately. - Downoy - Yes father call the district's head monk to get him out of monkhood, and the police to arrest him. Call the police? Don't you dare. Don't you dare. Singh, you've caused a big trouble. Sayan, you dare look at my wife? - I should put a bullet in your head. - You jackass. Get inside the hall. Go. Por. It's my fault to let you stay in the temple. You three help me dig it up. Quickly. Hey, why don't you use monks to help you dig, huh? Don't you get out. Son of a bitch. Shut up, you asshole. Come help me. What a trouble maker. What are you looking for? A bag filled with money is underneath, before this hall was built. - What money? - You want to know? Go down and help us dig. Father. Father. - Shut up - Father You go donw. Father. Does he have the medicine? Yes. Hey, Por go fetch the medicine from his chamber, Now! Hang on, father. Go back to your place. Father. You three are such greedy morons. Why the hell did you have to bury the money? Are you going to help me, or you want me to bury you here? If I can have my cut, I'll help. Mister. Mister It's time to make rounds for food offerings. Nobody is going anywhere. Shut up. Can't you see I'm sleeping? Today's an important Buddhist holiday. What I'm doing is important too. If no one goes out to receive food offerings, we won't have anything to eat. Father Downoy, you go get food offerings. Take these two novice monks with you. Por, you go with them. Novice monks. Novice monks. Where are you going? Go receive food offerings. Yes. Where's the abbot? He's sick. When is he giving the sermon? We all unite to offer meal to the Buddha both main course and dessert to the Great Buddha. He's not here. Where are all other monks? Not in their chambers. Singh. Singh. What is it? What. Let me see Shit. What the hell are these folks here for? Today is Magha Puja day. They're here to make merit and attend the sermon. Chase them away. Singh, are you mad? People are here to make merit. Are you chasing them away from making merit? I'll handle it. Singh. What? Do you want cops to swarm this temple? If you have a better idea, let me hear it. Do you? A monk. A monk is here. What are you all here for? Oh, we're here to attend the sermon. You're the man. You chased them away. I told them to wait at the sermon hall. What? Why didn't you tell them to go home. Right. They wouldn't until they've heard a sermon. Who usually gives sermons? Who gives sermons around here? Who? Parn, you give them a sermon. What kind of sermon can I give them? Ugh, must be me then. You talk about cats, dogs, whatever. Just give them something. Or do you want this bitch to talk? I'll give them a sermon. Let a monk handle a monk's duty. I say you stay here. I'm afraid you might say something wrong, and my gun could go off at the sermon hall. Then Pueng, you stay here and supervise the digging. Por, you take Father Downoy and these novice monks to go with me. I haven't had many chances to give a sermon. But there's something I'd like to say today. Today is a Magha Puja day, isn't it? Right, father. On an important day like this, only a handful of people come to temple. I believe there must be someone who are not even aware that today is Magha Puja day. Hey Abbot, before this hall was built, was there any hole around here? I think it might be, be… Boundary-marker hole. I'm thinking the abbot must have something to do with this. Singh, Singh. And where was that hole? Where the principle Buddha image is looking at. Yesterday, I went to the cremation of an old couple. They were hitted by a car when they cross the road to draw money. You know, they're old. But they let their only son work in the city far away. And the son was such careless. He only sent money to his elderly parents. It's their burden. They can barely walk. They had to take a ride to the city... to get the money. Their son must've thought his mom and dad really wanted his money. But he doesn't even know ... they're dead... I believe he's going to send money again next month to his cremated parents. Are you going to wait for those two? You evil bitch. Everything I said, I just want you to think about how you teach your children. Teach them well. Teach them about the true form of gratefulness. Understand them. Before teaching them, ask yourself first, whether it's money or their love you want. You all go home now. The sermon is over. Please leave. Lady. Your words touched me deeply. It made me think of how I raised my son. He ran away from home. It's been a long time since I last met him. I wish he would come home some day. It must be hard to be blind. Yes, but I don't regret not being able to see anymore. The only thing I regret is not being able to see my son's yellow robe. Mom. Hey, Parn. Parn. Dow, the sermon is over. Let's go home. Mom. Parn. What are you doing? I'm going to find the money. I've had enough of this. I'm going home. Parn, let's go home. Parn. Let's go home. Why? You suddenly become all holy? Asshole. Didn't you mean any of what you've just preached? I meant what I said. Mom is waiting for our money. So she could see our yellow robes. Idiot. You are the idiot. You are the idiot. Parn. She'd better be blind than seeing you like this, bastard. Why is it so damn hard to find? Shit. Step back. Let me do it. When dharmma can't give you the light, all the light you have left is from these joss sticks. Spit. Son of a bitch, where the hell is it? You didn't hide the money here. Where the hell is it? I don't think there's any money in there. Are you shitting me, huh? You dare to shoot me? Come on, shoot me, Son of a bitch. Do you dare? You keep your head straight first and we can talk asshole. Don't preach. You see there's no money. Don't do it. Hey, Hey. That's gold. If there's no money, I'll take gold. Don't do it. The Nak Prok Buddha is the symbol of faith for this village. You want to die? Singh, don't you think you've done enough sins? Bastard. Hey Hey, I'm here for money only. You're a moral thief? What the hell are you doing to this temple? Do you want to ordain them, or be forced to do it, father? You know what I want, Singh. I didn't double-cross you, Captain! These two bastards took your money. It means… Right. How will we split it? I get half of it. The rest is up to you. You don't have to stay here, but all the police in this province are hot on your asses. Do you want to risk your lives? Bastard. They've agreed to stay here. Now you decide if you will allow them to. But if they can't stay here, no one can stay in this temple either. Is there anyone here quick enough to get out of this gun's way? I told you to find the money, not to destroy the temple. Sons of bitches. Things have gone unplanned, captain. Things have gone unplanned since I told you to rob the money truck. Robbing the money truck? That's a lot of money then. Are you sure they're really up to this plan? I'm sure. But... Are you going to give me all of it? Bitch, that's several million. But if I do, would you come live with me? If I could round them up, I'll pay you double. Are you sure you want a hooker like me to live with you? Do you dare to leave your husband? I'm always ready to dump that son of a bitch. So, Captain. I told you the robbing plan, and you robbed it yourself. Bastard. Son of a bitch. Bastard. Singh, Singh, look what he did. - Look what he did - Shut up, bitch. So there's no money? I need to arrest someone then. How about... You guys stay in the prison for a while. Look. Everyone, look what this bastard cop is trying to do to us. Look! Keep in mind the reason you're still alive today beacuse of me Really, shoot me then. Shoot me if you dare. Shoot me Father Could you be my witness? I'm taking them to jail. Father, isn't this hall too quick to be built? Hey. You think things are that easy, huh? You backstabbing punk. Singh. Bastard. Parn. - Don't make a freaking move. - Singh You don't think you're already going to hell? Parn. Parn. Parn. Don't move. You want one too, father? Please, I'm begging you to stop. Parn. Don't taint Buddhism any further. Please don't. Don't taint Buddhism any further. Don't taint Buddhism any further. This is not the way to end suffering. Parn. Look at me. This bullet will tell you how to end suffering. Singh. Singh. Is it that bag? I said, is it that bag? It is, bitch. Parn. Parn. Parn. No, Parn. Stay with me. Mom. Mom. Mom. Don't follow me. Parn. You can't die. Mom is waiting for you. Parn. Parn You lied. You lied. Bastard. You lied. Son of a bitch You lied. Calm down. Don't come near me. Put down your weapon and we can talk. Don't force me. Get out. Get out. Get out. Don't force me. Don't come near me. Get out. God help me. Please don't. Parn... Father. Even if I made a thousand confessions, I wouldn't be forgiven for the sins I've committed. It was ... all my fault. 4years Later Are you a leper? No, sir. Do you have abscess? No, sir. Are you a human? Yes, sir. Are you a male? Yes, sir. Are you a free man? Yes, sir. Have your parents allowed? Yes, sir. Do you have your alms bowl and robes? Yes, sir. What is your name? My name is Dharma Palo. Sathu. Mother, why are you crying? Nothing. I just regret not being able to see your yellow robe. Here it is, mother. My yellow robe. Your Reverence. You seem to have changed. Everything changes, sir. I see. Including you. Do you remember me asking about the four kinds of lotus? I do. Have you figured out which group you belong to? I think I'm the lotus beneath Buddha's feet. Daddy. Daddy. Being a monk is like rowing against the stream. When you can't go on anymore you have to let the stream take you. My life is like that too. Your life is waste. May I be excused. Let's go, Hank. Sir. Buddhism sees money as a venomous serpent, not an essential part of happiness. Once we are able to say enough, our lives will not be burned with desires and defilements. Craving is bottomless. The only way is to stop. Happiness is not far away. It is in every person's heart. This is the dharma that Buddhism has taught me. My only wish now, is to be reborn into a Buddhist person in each of my future lives. So I have a chance to listen to Buddha's teachings, under the monk's robe forever. Four months later, Chuen was arrested. The Nak Prok Buddha was seized, along with some of the stolen money yet to be spent. Por decided to turn his back to the secular world, and has since devoted himself to Buddhism under monk’s robe. The Nak Prok Buddha has returned to Palom Temple, without cement to conceal its purity. Likewise, no matter how time changes, the core of Buddhism will always stay pure and sublime. It is a matter of whether humans could see through.
