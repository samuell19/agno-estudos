And you, ladies, I want you to cover the market area. Split the boardwalk as you wish, but cover the whole area. Here. Oh, remember that we cash up at six. - Carlos, what about me? - You're fired, Pepa. What the fuck are you on about, man? You should have thought about that before bringing your child to work. What did you expect, Pepa? Things don't work like that, darling. Coming here as if nothing happened? No way. It doesn't work like that. Carlos, come on, please. No, I'm sorry. Carlos, I'm begging you, please. You know it's all I got. Don't hold me accountable for your shitty life. Give me my fucking tickets. - Stop! - Where's my money? - No way. - Let go. What money? What money? What I earned yesterday. Yesterday's earnings. Give me my damn money. Give me my money or I'll burn this shit down! OK, relax! Now leave! Of course I'm leaving this shitty nightclub. Working at your age with these kids... Fuck off! Fuck all of you! What's wrong? - Can I take a dip now? - Yes. Can you adjust it? It's fine, Leila. - Are you getting in? - No, I don't feel like it. Oh, Leila! What are you doing? Are you silly or something? The water's cold, right? - Yes. Do you want to play a game? No, I don't feel like it. Come on, you don't even have to move. - What game? - The letter one. How does it work? I have to write a word on your back and you have to guess it. OK. Let's. Wait, wait, press harder. Ow, not that hard. Done. "House?" Another one, that was an easy one. Go on. Did you write "poo"? Don't write nasty things on my back, Leila. Come on, go quicker. - I'm done playing, let's leave. - No! Let's go, Leila. - What are you making? - Mayo-chup. - What's that? - A sauce. Who taught you that? Blanca, a friend from school. We went to the dining hall and they gave us a burger. - No, thanks. - It's yummy. Damn, it is yummy. That's disgusting, Leila. Harder! Like this? Harder. Damn, Leila, you'll end up flying. - Pepa? - Yes. Pepa, I've been calling you all day, you left me worried yesterday. Did something happen? No, no, it was a mistake. Are you sure? Is everything OK? Is the girl OK? Of course, why shouldn't she be? Damn, Pepa, you called at five in the morning, what do you think? Mum, listen, stop looking for excuses to call, OK? What are you on about, child? What's fucking wrong? Please tell me. OK, OK, bye. Boo! I love this. Where did you find this? Let's see. Boo! Check this, Leila. Check, Leila. Make-up. Wow. Damn, you did a bad job, child. Let's see.

Your eyelashes are pink. Press the button, we're getting off. Can you reach it? NOW! You'll hit the lady. Oh, sorry. Hello, girls. - Hi. - Our bags. What are they doing there? Well, please give me a second, I'll be right back. Hello, Pepa, right? Listen, we had a problem this morning with your booking. I tried to call you many times, but you probably missed it. I'll tell you why now. Listen, I'm really sorry, but I've had to cancel your booking, because a tourist couple has arrived who wants to stay until the end of August. But they had to check-in today. - Hold on. - And I had to give up you I paid you for the booking, right? Why would you give them my room? No, but we always reserve the right to cancel. No, let me tell you why for you to get it, honestly. I want you to understand. Listen, we are a small business. The big hotels nearby eat us alive so, of course, we don't have many means - Listen, listen. I made a booking here, OK? They didn't. What right do they have to take my room? Why the fuck did you give them my room? I don't get it. - I get that you're angry. - I paid. - Understand our stance... - Understand? You're scamming me. Nobody called me, OK? - Please check again. - I'm not checking anything! Nobody called me and that's that! No, no. I want my room, OK? And I want my money, all of it! - Get her money, Irene. Both fucking deposits! Here you have. - And my room. - I can't give you a room, it was the last one. Give me mine! Mine! Now kick out those tourists and give me my room. You made an agreement with me, not them, me. I'm going to kindly ask you to leave. Where are they? Where are they? - Stop, stop, damn it. - Don't touch me. Don't touch me. - I'm calling the cops. - I just want my room. I just want my room. - Stop, please. - Where are they? - Stop, please. Stop, please, stop already. No, you had an agreement with me! I'm so sorry, sorry. - I won't be left on the streets again! - Please. What are you doing? Are you calling the police? Yes, here at the guesthouse. To hell with it. - I've had a row with a customer. - What are you doing? Are you scared of me or what? You fuck me over and it's my fault. I have an issue here with a customer... You're fucking me over. - There's a little girl too - You're a son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! - Dad, hang up! - No, she hasn't broken anything, but... - I'm leaving, I'm leaving! Tell them you've scammed me, prick! You've scammed me, son of a bitch! I can't believe it! - Where are we going? - I don't know. Ow, you're hurting me. I'm also tired, OK? I'm also tired! I try to fix things and you mess them. You follow me and mess everything! Do you want to leave? Go, leave! Leave! Crazy girl and mouth And even though she kisses With her fruits She gets her words wrong My voices are air, they fly My days are mud, they weigh My moons are suns, you lie My eyes are water, fountains Oh, how my wings weigh Oh, I feel like kissing you, air My feathers, my feathers are weary And make my heart dance And make my heart dance Oh, crazy girl Oh, crazy girl, crazy, crazy, crazy This is my mouth And even though she kisses with her fruits She gets her words wrong Crazy girl, crazy, crazy, crazy And even though she kisses with her fruits She gets her words wrong She gets her words wrong Crazy girl, crazy girl This is my mouth And even though she kisses with her fruits Crazy girl, crazy girl She gets her words wrong She gets her words wrong Oh, crazy girl, crazy girl And crazy girl, crazy, crazy Crazy girl Crazy mouth Crazy mouth Crazy mouth Oh, words She gets them wrong She gets them wrong Mum! Where were you? I don't know. Stop here. - Pepa? - Yes, it's me. I'm opening. - Done. - Done? Mum? Mum? - Child. I didn't expect you this early. Let me see you. Oh, how beautiful, how big, how everything. Come over here. Oh, my darling! How are you? - Fine. - Fine? She's beautiful, child! How are you? How was the trip? - OK, a bit tired. It's many hours, right? But you're here now. Let me give you another hug. A big one, like this. Hand over your things, darling. Listen, I've set the big room. A big bed, so you'll be comfortable there. And I've left you your mum's old cuddly toys. They're on the bed, I hope you like them. Is that OK? OK, I don't know. Whatever. Go ahead, you already know where everything is. SQ? Do you like it, Leila? Where are you sleeping then? Ever since dad, I don't sleep here. Look, do you know who this belonged to? It's your mum's, when she was a girl, do you want it? All yours. Look. A fan, for Seville's heat. Do you want it? Here, all yours, too. Do you want breakfast? Does she like ham? Do you like ham? - Are you hungry, Leila? - No? Do you want a bath? Oh, OK. I'll get the bath ready. OK, but wait, let me get the heater on, it's quite tricky. Off. Boobs! When the water gets here, turn it off, OK? And bathe yourself, you know how. What are you doing, sweetie? You've put coffee on? Great. Let me make it. - There's no need. Let me, come on. Let me make it! Have some juice, or the vitamins will disappear. Let me make it. Go on, sit down there and rest. Here. Thanks. For coming back home. It's really great for me that you're here. It bothered me all these years, Pepa. I've missed you a lot. I think things could have been very different, and I believe it's my fault. I don't know. I could have done things better, I guess. I'd like to say sorry. I don't want you to say sorry. OK. I quit my job at my boss's house, I'm not sure if you knew. I was sick of being there. Now I'm waiting for Mara-a to... Do you remember Marl-a? Your friend, yes. Well, I'm waiting for news to see if I'll work with her. At the bakery. I want a change of scenery. What have you been doing? Tell me. I honestly don't feel like telling you anything. Nor for you to tell me anything, to be honest. Come on, Pepa, child. You've never told me things like that before, got it? What were you hoping for? Right. I get it... I called you because I didn't know... where else to go, you know? And because I'm trying to stop focusing solely on myself, to be honest. I think I'm doing a shit job. I don't even know how to take care of her, you know? I don't even know how to touch her. But at least I had courage to come here and ask for your help. Something you never did once. I'm not mad at you. I'm not, honestly. I don't want you to say sorry. Honesfly. This is not about you or me. I'll get the coffee.
