Vessel dead ahead, sir. Right rudder. One short blast, mister. Vessel sighted on the port bow, sir. Slow ahead. Slow ahead it is, sir. Stop engines. Stop engines. Run her amidships. - Run her amidships, sir. Engines full astern. Engines full astern, sir. Stop engines. Stop engines, sir. Take over, Mr Black. I'm going to board her. Lower away the emergency boat. Aye aye. Standby to lower away the emergency boat. We've searched the ship, sir. The radio is smashed. There's dry blood in the crew's quarters and messroom. There's water in the engine room, but the seacocks are all closed. There's not one living thing aboard the whole ship, sir. Maybe your father is okay, Captain. Maybe .. - He's dead. We'll put a salvage crew aboard and take her into New Orleans. Yes, sir. What do you think happened? - Where did you find the ship? Is your father okay? Maybe things got so hot for the old man, he had to take a powder? Do you think my father would leave his ship at sea if he were alive? Let me through. It's been a tough job, I'd say. - Yeah. He's plenty mad. Hello, Captain Angel. - Hello. Where's Gustafson? He's inside. - I'll go through. Cotton bales for immediate shipment. Take it from Warehouse 'C' and have it aboard the John Ellis by 10 tonight. The Pilot and tugs are all ordered for 10:30. Captain Angel. Good to see you. Where's Gusty? In the conference room with his wife. Captain Angel. I want you to know. How very sorry I am about your father. He was such a good man. I know that, Miss Drumm. Just a moment. I'll announce you. - Don't bother. That's why I took you out of the place. I don't want you to be seen in the Jewell Box. Johnny Angel. Hello. Captain. So you found the Emmaline Quincy? - Yes, sir. I'd like to talk to you alone. Will you please excuse us, Mrs Gustafson? Lilah, if you don't mind, please. You said alone, Johnny. But this is as alone as you can hope for. She still thinks she's his nursemaid. As Secretary Treasurer of the company. I try to assume some of the burden of the business. Gusty can't do it all. Now. The Emmaline Quincy is tied up in port. She took a cargo of steel rails to Casablanca. She was to come back with African mahogany. I understand the cargo of mahogany is still aboard. Yes .. the cargo is aboard. But my father and the crew aren't. Doesn't that interest you? Why yes, of course. I understand my father cabled you from Casablanca. Did he say he expected trouble of any kind? I received that cable, Captain. Gusty was in Maine at the time. Your father indicated nothing out of the ordinary. Johnny, believe me. The great, profound shock we all felt upon learning about your father. I didn't come here for regrets. I want information. I actually don't know what I can say about what's happened, except to .. Look, Johnny. There hasn't been much time to investigate. You just brought the ship in. Now, when you've had an opportunity to examine it thoroughly. I want a written report. The condition of the cargo. I'm not interested in the condition of the cargo. I want to find out what happened to my father. Gusty understands that, Captain. Of course I do. - Yeah. Maybe if you spent half as much time worrying about your ships .. As you do for your wife, the company would be in better shape. Captain Angel. - Johnny. Instead, you sit around and let this .. This ex-nurse run your business. Here .. ask her if you can float it in your bathtub tonight, sonny. Tell Lilah to come back in here. Oh, you shouldn't have done that, Gusty. Get Lilah in here. Do you hear me? Gusty .. you don't want to see Lilah. She only upsets you. Did you want me, darling? Alright now. Where was I, Lilah? Just where you always are, Gusty. You want me to stay out of Sam Jewell's nightclub. You were painting a beautiful picture of yourself as the gallant knight. Who'd rescued me from that place. Lilah. Oh quit believing all that hero stuff Miss Drumm has fed you all your life. And let me alone. I know just how you feel, Johnny. I'll see you first of the week at the inquest. Something may turn up then. I'd like to start sooner on my own. Is that okay, sir? Sure. Go ahead. Thanks. Anybody get off the ship in the last few hours? Absolutely no-one. See anybody on the dock who didn't seem to belong here? A girl, maybe? A girl? Yeah. Did you get a look at her face? - Only her back. Nice. She carried a suitcase. A suitcase? What was she wearing? A green raincoat and a funny little hat. - A raincoat? Hey, where's the driver? Come on, Honey. Let's walk. A cab, Captain Angel? Yeah. Where is the driver? - How far you going? Who wants to know? Me. Celestial O'Brien. Ride? How did you know my name? - Everybody knows who you are, Captain. Take my cousin, Eric Branson. He doesn't get around very much. Even he knows who you are. Where to? Don't you suppose a girl. A French girl, say. Who had no home, no friends, would go to The Quarter? Could be. Go to the far end and work back. Okay, Captain. Stick around. - Don't worry. Is there anyone new around here? - You bet. Who? - You, silly. I'll be right back, boys. Hello, Johnny. You've been eating vitamins again. Huh. The angel is not much fun tonight. Evening, Captain. - Hello. Thanks. Don't things ever change? Have you got anybody new in the place? - Come again? Somebody new? A fresh face? I can't hear. I'm deaf. It seems to be an epidemic. I've been given the same story in every joint in The Quarter. Okay, then. You know better than to ask questions. Whether a dame is here ten years or ten minutes. It's her own business. Even a morgue has got rules. What's the matter? Fly in it? Please, I .. A dance? No thank you. I was just leaving. You're new here, aren't you. Certainly not. What makes you think that? The girls here don't usually refuse a man a dance. I'm sorry, but I have an errand. What's your brand of vitamins, honey? A friend of yours? Yes. What's her name? Juliet. Merci. Sit down. That girl's name was Betty. Does it matter? A great deal. - Why? Because you are new here. And you're French. Does it make a difference? - Yes. I can't see why. I'm Captain Angel. You know the name, don't you? Really, you confuse me. I don't know you at all. I must go. I want you to stay. - Please. Because I'm looking for a girl not as tired as the others. Somebody bright and new. Like a new penny. I'm not new here. Why .. I have been here for quite some time. Weeks. Really, you speak of a girl as if she were a .. I don't like that. You want me to talk? Very well. My name is Paulette. I am French. That's all. Then you're not new here. I am sorry .. I had hopes. You say you've been here for weeks. You can measure it by kisses. How many kisses ago since you came here? My coat. Give me that packet. Hey, Dolly. You'd better get Joe. There is going to be trouble. Hurry up. Looks like rain. You are new here. Leave my room, please. A bright penny. - Go away. Please go away. There is just one more thing. What are you doing? That isn't mine. It isn't mine at all .. it isn't. Ever hear of Cinderella? Are you going to stop lying? I don't know what you're talking about. - That raincoat. The shoe. It isn't mine. I tell you .. - Are you going to tell the truth? You don't belong here. Don't pretend to. When I found the Emmaline Quincy there was one person aboard it all the time. You. Nobody saw you. But tonight when it got dark, you managed to sneak off. Popped into a cab. You wanted a place where nobody would bother you or ask questions. This is it. I tell you I don't know what you're talking about. If you don't say what happened on the ship .. You're wrong. I know nothing. Get out of here, Captain. - Beat it, Joe. Leave. Sure. But you're coming with me. You heard what I said .. beat it. Come on, get out! Wait for me. - Right as rain, Captain. Oh well. Captain Angel. I've read about the Emmaline Quincy. Too bad about .. I didn't know you could read. You alone? - Yeah. Where is Sam? - Right over there. Is she a regular thing here? - Lilah? No. She don't work here no more, if that's what you mean. But Sam and Paul are opening up new place down in Rio and .. She's kind of hunchy about the idea. Is her husband around? - Gustafson? He goes to bed early at night. With a glass of milk. Johnny. Speak of the devil. - What were you saying about me? What everybody else is. You are the talk of the town. Haven't you seen the papers? No. Quite a spread. Sit down, Johnny. Have a drink with us. Thanks. Why not? Sorry about your father, Johnny. I'm sure you are. Really. A terrible thing, Johnny. Where's your brother, Sam? I don't see him around. Paul is out of town. In Rio as a matter of fact. You don't seem to do much business here. Oh, I get by. One way or another. Is that it? Well. What did you really come in here for, Johnny? Nothing in particular. - No? I spotted you when you came in. Alone, fishing about. Whenever anything happens in this town people always come to me. You'd think I was a Who's-Who on crime. Well .. you do have a lot of friends. I wouldn't talk like that if I were you, Johnny. Not if it was my father who was right in the middle of it all. Leave him out of this. I know how you feel. Make yourself at home. Lilah will keep you company. I have some business to attend to, if you'll excuse me. Quite a busy man. Where are you going? - Just over there. I'm so glad you came tonight. It's like it used to be, isn't it, Johnny. You want to know something? A lot of things. I mean something I know? Sure. There are two things I've never had enough of in my life. Money .. any you, Johnny. Come on Lilah, you .. You're still restless. Tell me. Who's in your heart now? Gusty or Sam? You could answer that if you wanted to. I can't figure you. You're a big success now. Married to a steamship line. Yes. Married to a steamship line. How exciting. What am I getting out of it? Love? Ha. Gusty is spineless. He jumps like a jack-in-the-box every time Miss Drumm opens her mouth. Johnny, he's impossible. And rich. You poor kid. I feel sorry for you. You just don't want to understand. I guess it's the wrong time, huh? I'm going now. Think of me a little. Goodnight, Lilah. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshots! ] You okay? Yeah. I'm alright. - What happened? Where is the girl? - Girl? I suppose you didn't know. No, I didn't. She was headed straight for the Jewell Box. Anybody could see that. You got a girl here, mister? - No girl. Nobody. Everybody go. Please, I implore you. Mister, let me pick up the cigars, please. Take a look around, Joe. Alright. Tell us what went on here. Ask him. You saw me come in. I was right behind you. This would appear to be your party, Johnny. You're a little clubfooted on land, aren't you Captain. You got a permit for that, Jewell? - You know I haven't. Nobody here, Jim. Nobody at all. Well, Captain Angel. A few questions. [ Singing: ] "Memphis in June." "A shady veranda." "Under a Sunday blue sky." Kinda nice down in this part of the country, don't you think? I saw the shooting. What are you talking about? Oh, ma'am. I even backed the cab up a little so I could see. You weren't even in the cab when I came out. I was round behind. I'm not looking for any stray bullets you know. Here we are. Where? I didn't tell you .. - You didn't know. Now my cousin Hugh runs the place. He's done a little time in jail but .. It's alright .. come on. Yes, but my bag? I checked it. Just tell me where it is and I'll go pick it up. Oh, you sailors. It's always the same. You see a girl. Then bingo .. you must see her again. The same one, always. Her .. this one is not here. You can see for yourself. What are you doing? Following me around? Don't you think I have a right to? - Oh yes. I didn't pay you last night. Because you didn't wait. I'm not that fond of shootings. Ride? Where to, Captain? - I don't know. A hotel. Any special one? - Any hotel. We got the same problem we had last night. I see .. same girl? Yeah. And you don't know where she is? No. [ Singing: ] "Memphis in June." "With sweet oleander." "Blowing perfume in the air." You should put your heart into your work, Captain. Put your foot on the gas and change that tune. Do you like surprises, Captain? Take my cousin, Hugh, for instance. He even goes in doors backwards because he likes surprises. I'll tell you a surprise. Your flag is up. What's this? Right inside. Straight ahead. Why? You're looking for the girl, aren't you? How did you know where she was? I brought her here. - Well, why didn't you tell me? You stick around. Celestial. You can fix that gadget, can't you? I've come for the story. Oh yes. Oh yes. Of course. I remember you now. You are the man from LaRue who .. Who imagines I have a story to tell. Of course, I remember now. Look. I'm not going to hurt you. You were on that ship. All I want to know is what happened. You can trust me. My father was on that ship. You know that. Wait a minute. You mean ..? You think my father was ..? - I don't know what to say. I can't think. I don't know. I .. Get your coat. Where are we going? Out of here. I know what you've been through. The ship .. then last night. You know about last night? I wasn't the one who shot at you. Breathe again, will you. Don't be frightened. I know you can't talk now. Come on. Feel better now? Yes. You know I thought I could trust him. Who? Celestial. Oh, forget about that. It's nice here, isn't it. Yes, it's beautiful. Do you come here often? I used to play here when I was kid. Finally, you got your own ship. You love the sea, don't you. Of course. I can't see how you could ever leave this beautiful land here. You're a landlubber, I can see that. If you had a dad like mine though, you'd understand. I always wanted to be just like him. Paulette. - Yes? Even though you were on my father's ship, you didn't come to me for help. I want to tell you a story. You have your reasons. Whatever you may think. My father never knowingly did a wrong thing in his life. Just tell me this. Is he dead? Yes. You see, I'm telling you. I like you, Captain Angel. And if I'm wrong about you, I lose. You won't lose. What about the crew? They're all dead except one. Except one? Who's he? I don't know. But he's the one who killed your father. I understand how you feel. My father was killed, too. Was he on the Quincy? No. But it was because of him that I was there. You see, there was five million dollars in gold bullion on your father's ship. Perhaps you know that already. No, I didn't. And it all happened on account of that? - Yes. It was French gold. Entrusted to my father's keeping. In Casablanca. But how did my father have ..? - I don't know. I don't know. I'm just confused. I .. Let's walk again, shall we? Sure. I know I'll not to make this very clear, but I'll try. You see, the gold was stolen from my father. And he was killed in such a way as to make him appear careless. And untrustworthy. When I found out the day the Emmaline Quincy was to sail from Casablanca. That the gold was being shipped on her to America. To New Orleans. I knew if the gold disappeared. My father's name could never be cleared again. So I decided to follow it and find out who received it. I didn't know how to get on the Emmaline Quincy. But I made up my mind to see the Captain .. and try. Emmaline Quincy. Captain Angel, your stores are here. I got the ship's orders outside, Captain. And when I heard that name. I remembered a Captain Angel that used to come to my father's house. And that was really good. It was right after my mother died. He was very, very kind to me. And I hoped he would not have forgotten. Forgive me Johnny, but .. Even hoping that he would remember my father and help me. I was bewildered and .. And terrified at the realization that he must know about the gold. But I had to take that chance. Captain Angel. - Yes? Captain Angel. I'm Paulette Girard. Well, what is it, Miss? Why, years ago you knew my father. Paulette Girard. You? - Yes. Well. Once, when I was a little girl. You bought me a Chinese fan with a blue kingfisher on it. Remember? You had a red beard then. I never forgot you. Of course I remember. You look a lot like your father. You know, I tried to teach him chess but he never would learn as hard as I tried. Has he learned the game yet? My father is dead, Captain Angel. Sorry to hear that. Too bad. Too bad. I heard your ship was ready to sail. Take me to America with you, Captain. America? Why you want to go ..? Yes, I know it's asking a great deal. But you see, I .. I'm alone and .. it's difficult. I have relatives over there I could go to. You sent for me, Captain? - Yes. Just a minute. Excuse me. - Certainly. I think we can take care of you. - Why, thank you. Better be getting aboard. - Right. I told him I didn't have a passport. He said the authorities were very strict about those matters. And there would be a penalty. But he thought in my case he may be able to straighten it out once we got there. Anyway, he tried. Want something? - No. No. I just wanted to thank you for my comfortable cabin. I'm glad you like it. It isn't often we have a lady sailing with us. Why have you stopped, Captain? Taking on a bit of cargo. I have to see to it. Take over, Mr Raymond. - Aye aye, sir. You had better go to your cabin. - Yes. That's all, Captain. Take your ladder inboard. Let go of your bow line. That's all. - Aye aye, sir. It's aboard, but I don't feel very good about it. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. Then forget what you heard. The other passengers. Like you .. are kind of stowaways. Goodnight. - Goodnight. "Nothing eventful happened for several days." "I was terribly worried and confused." "I couldn't make up my mind whether your father had anything to do with it." "But as we were nearing the Gulf of Mexico .." What's the matter, Lefty? Trouble with the men, sir. - The men? [ Gunshots! ] Take Miss Girard to her cabin. - Aye aye, sir. Lock your door and stay until I send for you. This way, Miss. - Yes. Lock your door. Understand? - Yes. Who's that? Who are you? He's the stowaway the mate spoke about. Let him have it. - He's with us. We don't need him. - We do. He has a place ashore to keep the gold. Paul Jewell aboard The Dolphin will meet us and take us off with the gold. Come on, let's get busy. "I heard him say that Sam Jewell, Paul's brother .." "Owned the Jewell Box nightclub in New Orleans." Shake a leg, sailor. Let's get it down on the well deck. Come on, there. Open up. Everything ready? Before we do anything else, we've got to get rid of that girl. Go to her room and tell her Captain Angel wants to see her. Miss. Captain Angel sent me for you. Open the door, Miss. I've been looking for you. I never thought that you'd .. [ Gunshots! ] [ Gunshot ] During the night, all the murdered men were thrown overboard. At dawn, those that were left loaded the last boxes of gold aboard The Dolphin. That's all. What about the seacocks? Are they open? Open and water is pouring in, Mr Jewell. - Good. That woman's raincoat. It looks awfully screwy to me. - Okay. Okay, maybe she didn't go overboard. Maybe she's hiding. Let her hide. If she's on board, she'll sink with the ship. Okay. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] Don't shoot you fool. Don't do it. Don't do it! [ Gunshot! ] That's all .. you know all the rest, Johnny. Who did the killing? I never saw his face. But he must have seen me that first night in the cabin. Sure, he saw you. That's why he tried to kill you last night. And he'll try again. You can bet on that. Do you think the stowaway could be Sam Jewell? It could be anybody. And would Jewell murder his own brother? For five million? For that kind of money, he'd do anything. Johnny. Johnny, I'm afraid. Don't be. I won't let you down. I know you won't. But you understand why it was so hard for me to trust anybody, don't you. Sure. What can I do now? Nothing .. I want you to stay right here. Out of sight. Away from the Jewell Box. Away from everybody. Very well, Johnny. Of course, I don't want you dead. I want you just the way you are. I'll see you to the door. Oh, let him finish. It's lovely. [ Singing: ] "I could hear the clock inside a-ticking and a-tocking." "Everything is peaceful and dandy." "I can see your granny across the street still a-rocking." "Watching the neighbors go by." "Memphis in June." "Was sweet oleander." "Blowing perfume in the air." "Up jumps the moon." "To make it that much grander." "It's paradise. Brother take my advice." "Nothing is half as nice as Memphis in June." Hey, Celestial. Right, Captain. Thanks, cousin Hugh. Paulette, you'd better go inside. Very well. Miss Paulette. - Yes? While you're waiting. Why thank you, Celestial. - Sure. Got it? Yes, sir. The Dolphin. A power cruiser. Overall length forty feet. Diesel engines. Registered in the names of Paul and Sam Jewell. Anybody asked Sam Jewell where it is? Nah, it wouldn't do any good. He's too smart. You are right about that. I'd like it if you checked the sterns of boats of The Dolphin's description. The name may be painted over. - Okay, Captain. We'll comb the harbor for you. - See you later. Thanks. Good afternoon, Captain. What's going on here, mister? Boarding, sir. Orders from the office. Can I tell the Chief what time you want steam, sir? No. I'd like to have my orders changed. You've got plenty of other ships. It never occurred to us that you'd want to stay in port. Don't you have enough consideration? Well, the inquest is this week and maybe by the time you get back, we'll have it. Yes? Hello, dearest. Uh .. just a minute. What was I saying? Nothing .. nothing of importance. Well then, will you excuse me? I'm just getting all my papers in order. Can't you go with me tonight? Did you get what you wanted? No. Just doubletalk. His wife interrupted. But I'm not sailing. This is Drumm speaking. Have the cargo intended for the Isabel Putnam. Shifted to the Lucy May. To sail at midnight. Well, how thoughtful of you, Johnny. You know, it's quite a coincidence you wanting me to have dinner. I had intended getting in touch with you tonight. You said something about Johnny Angel and money. So, as long as you felt that way, I .. Thought I'd like to see you again. And you'd heard that Gusty was going away on a trip. I didn't want you to be lonesome. - That's sweet of you, Johnny. You really do like me, then? Crazy about you. But I think I got competition. Sam Jewell. Oh .. I wouldn't worry about him. I do, though. You go places with him. Clubs. I suppose you go on moonlight rides out on the gulf? Or up the river once in a while. What makes you think so? It's only natural. Sam's got a boat. The Dolphin. Been on it lately? No. I haven't seen The Dolphin for quite a while. I don't even know where it is. Let's not talk about Sam. Let's forget him. Okay. How would you like Utopia, Johnny? What kind of Utopia? Me. And all the money you can ever spend. Gusty's money? No, he's got nothing to do with it. It's mine. And it's gold, Johnny. I thought he was gone. She kept him from going. That's just like her. You'd better go. - But I .. I'll get rid of him in half an hour and meet you somewhere. How about The LaRue? Remember where it is? How could I forget? - I'll be there. Lilah. Hello, sweet. I thought you'd left town. I would have gone. Oh, I see. Miss Drumm thought I was having dinner with someone, no doubt. Yes. But you aren't, are you. You are alone, aren't you? Of course, darling. I've been alone all evening. Back again? For a drink. - Same? Same. Looking for someone again, tonight? - No. Waiting for someone. How is Joe? He quit. Hey Mack, fill them up. - You got it. That was quick. - Well, Gusty has finally gone. Are you sure? - I saw him off this time. Hi, Mack. You still around? You're looking great, Lily. Let's .. let's drink at the house. Is that where we're going? - Well, where else? I'm a lady now. I don't neck under piers anymore, Johnny. So long, Mack. - Good luck, Lily. Who's that? - She used to sing here. And me with no voice. She couldn't sing either, kid. Say you love me, darling. You love me, darling. - Oh. Quit walking up and down, will you. You make me feel like I'm in with a panther or a leopard or something. You want me to tell about that money, don't you? When you get around to it. Don't pretend. You can hardly wait. Well. How do I know I can trust you? You won't give me any proof. Of what? That you love me. What else could I want to know? You've always acted so .. So cagey. Oh sure. I throw myself at you and you put on your catcher's mitt. That's very sweet of you, but .. But what does it prove? Quit worrying, will you. Why shouldn't I worry? I may be awfully wrong. But it seems to me that the minute I mention money. Your interest in Lilah went up 87 points. Oh come here, baby. Why don't .. Now get out of here. What's the idea? Take it easy, Gusty. Captain Angel came here on a pretext of business. You thought I was gone. Well I was. I actually left. Then I had to come back. - Miss Drumm? She had nothing to do with it. I came back because .. I couldn't bear to go away without you. Oh Gusty, how sweet. And then I find you pawing at her. Trying to mislead her because she's beautiful. Trying to influence her. Trying to take her away from me. I'll tell you when to go. Since the day I was ten years old. And Miss Drumm saved me from a beating you were going to give me. I've hated you. I never told you, did I. I pretended to be friendly. Well, it was a lie. Now you can go. You are through. Do you hear me? You're through. [ Lilah: ] "Gusty, you were wonderful." [ Gusty: ] "You're the only person I've ever loved in my life." "You are the only thing I have." "Without you, I'm nothing." - "I know, dear." Then why did you encourage him? I know you did. Oh. [ Door knocks ] Who are you? What do you want? - Don't get excited, lady. Who are you? - I'm Biggsy. He's Mr Isherwood. Johnny Angel wants to see you and he sent us to escort you personally. Why didn't he come himself? He couldn't get here. He's busy. So he asked us to come for you. - Oh. Oh, I see. Say, did that screwball Celestial show you how to work this? No. No, as a matter of fact I've had a hard time trying to make it go. Here you are, sister. Where are we going? - Look, we can't tell you everything. All we're supposed to do is bring you. This is no time for games, Biggsy. Angel is waiting. - Loan me this, will you sister? Certainly. Just take it. - Thanks. Now all I do is rub this stick .. On this stick. And you watch the propeller. Can you whistle? [ Whistle ] Whistle again. [ Whistle ] Here, boy. Miss Paulette. Hello, Celestial. Hello. [ Buzzer ] Yes? "Biggsy is on his way up with the girl." Fine. I don't want to be disturbed until you hear from me. Tell the operator. "Okay." [ Door knocks ] Come in. Well, at last you got here. I'm glad. My name is Jewell. Where is Johnny Angel? Did you tell her Johnny would be here? - Well .. Boss, you mean Johnny isn't going to be here? Well, I hardly think so. At least not just now. He may drop in later. You boys can go off. Sit down. What do you want with me? Here. Sit down. Just for a minute, at least. I wanted you here to try to help you. Drink? No thank you. Why did you want to see me? I don't want to see you. Come now .. last night you were on your way here and .. You didn't get here. You are obviously in some sort of trouble. You must have thought I could help you then. Well, what's it all about? I have nothing to say to you. Oh, I see. Johnny Angel is helping you with your troubles, is he? I hardly know him. Look, my dear .. I know Johnny Angel very well. I know he wouldn't be fooling around with you at a time like this. Unless you knew something about his father. I want to know what that something is. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I think you do. And I think you've told me. I'll never tell you anything. I wonder why. Because you are the kind of person you are. You are like your brother was. Was? She isn't in there. Where is she? - The Jewell Box. How do you know? I saw her go in. - Why didn't you do something? She wanted to go in. Why she .. - Why, I ought to .. You are lying. - I wish I was. Come on. So you know about The Dolphin? I didn't say that. No. I guess you didn't. I think we've finished now. I must go. Here. This way. The place is closed, Johnny. - I'm looking for Sam. Sam? Sam ain't here. I'll make up my own mind about that. Oh, Johnny. Lilah. I can't rest. I was wrong. I admit it. Lilah, please. Alright. Alright, alright. You'll come along? Right away? Good morning, Captain. You'll be able to go over the charts with me this morning. No, I'm going ashore. May I come in? Sure. Surprised? Yeah. Isn't it pretty early for you to be calling? You weren't running out on me, Johnny. Or were you? You should know better than that. Then where were you going? To see you. Why? To finish the conversation we started last night. It was very interesting. Oh .. I see. You've come to tell me to forget the whole thing. You were only kidding. - You're a fool. Gusty might have changed .. - Shut up! I'm through with all that. It's you and me now, Johnny. That's pretty hard to believe. Don't you understand? All I want is proof from you. Proof? What about you? How about you running out on me? What have you done except hang a little bait in front of me? And then when I swallowed it, you want to quibble. Well, go ahead and quibble. Johnny. Come back. I'm the fool. I was silly to worry about you. Kiss me, darling. Want to do a little proving to me? - Anything. Tell me there is that gold. - There is. Then take me to it. I am taking you, Johnny. Don't worry, Miss Paulette. He'll be alright. We shouldn't have let him go back. I can't forget Sam Jewell's face. Where are we headed? What's the plan? Sorry. We're going to Tea Kettle Island. There's an empty house there and I have the only key to it. The Dolphin is underneath the house in a dock. The gold is aboard. I thought you didn't know anything about The Dolphin. I can't give in too soon. I had to find out how you felt first. What's he going to say about this? Sam? Forget him. What has he got to do with this gold? Nothing. But he did have. Yes. But he doesn't know you counted him out. Of course not. He doesn't dream of anything between you and me. Lilah is smart. So all you must do is put the gold on your ship. Sail to Rio. And I'll take a plane and meet you there. You seem to forget that Gusty fired me last night. I fixed that. Well, Johnny. This is the end of the rainbow. Did we keep you waiting long, Sam? I'm coming in. [ Lilah screams! ] Drop that gun, Angel. Gusty. I lived, Lilah. You shouldn't let this spoil your .. I was in your way, wasn't I. So you put a knife in me. Gusty .. Gusty. Gusty, you must listen to me. Let me tell you .. - No. Not anymore. And I'm glad you did it. Because any other way and I never would have believed it, see. But I've kept remembering. Remembering how you told me about the gold. Remembering those nights we spent planning what we'd do when I got it. You said. Just you and I figuring. I was deathly afraid of the sea. But I crossed it for you. To stow away on my own ship. I worshipped you. Isn't that funny? I loved you so much. You could have done anything with me .. made me anything. But no. You made me a murderer. Gusty. Keep away from me. You thought I'd gone to Maine. You didn't know. Even your father didn't know what I was going to do with the gold. I lied to him about it. And he believed in me. And I had to kill him because .. Stand back, Johnny. My father was the best friend you ever had. Get back, Johnny. Get back. Put that gun down, Gusty. No, no! I'm really sad for Lilah. - I don't care about her. I'm sorry for Miss Drumm. Johnny, it's been terrible just sitting here waiting. Come on now. The rain is over. ..t-g..
