Captain Kehding. Leonberg, 9th Division. I suojelusnenkelinne. You come with us. - No. No! I am Lilli Simoneit - Erika Galetschky Königsberg. Gather your strength, Kehding. Some of these have been traveling for weeks - and your ship is the last hope! Brawler! Our skipper, I suppose? Kehding. I will register for the service. Do well! How did you find me? Your letter. I know how to get to Gustloff. You have to come too. Tell me, what is my brother doing here? Despite his injury, he is employed. He has a cabin - he is a submarine. You always did everything right. Mom didn't have to worry - but Evil Harald did the dirty work! We're engaged, that's enough. Are you kidding? You lazy coward too. Let's start here. It’s time to leave, especially because of those bombers. The weather is getting worse. Then open the gates and let everyone in! The whole world is bleeding. War comes all the way to our homes, and we pay for everything. Out of here! Take the kids out! The bomb shelter! All for bomb shelter! Sorry. Radisti Koch. Have I seen you on the ship? Like I said, my cousin in a public place. Yes, you understand. The decision is now made: We will leave at 12:30 tomorrow. I'll make sure you all get to Kiel with Gustloff. Thousands of civilians are in danger! I am responsible for my men. We are needed in the Languages to change the direction of the war . The embarkation is over. The ship is leaving the port. You stay here. I will come back. SHlP OF NO RETURN GUSTLOFFlN VllMElNEN MATKA OSA2: PAKO lT lMEREN YLl Give way. Where is Lieutenant Kehding? He is here. - Thank you. Lieutenant Kehding? - Yes. You have an official message from your adjutant. What are you waiting for? - He was on the pier. Anything else? - No, Lieutenant. Get off. lrrotus from tug, slow speed forward, starboard 46 degrees. disengagement from the tug. Machines, slow forward. - Slow down. Slowly steer to 46 degrees. Is everything going well? We are at Gustloff. Jumala yksin tietää, mitä tulee tapahtumaan, mutta - hän ei olisijohdattanut meitä näin pitkälle vaikeuksien läpi - jos tämä ei päättyisi hyvin. Toivottavasti pikkusiskoni - ei pelkää tuntemattomien kanssa. Anna minun löytää äitini - jotta voimme olla yhdessä. Anna sodan loppua. Mitä minun Kallille tehdään, jos hänet löydetään? Kaksi samanlaista poikaa teloitettiin lähellä Legitteniä. Pojat olivat kuusitoistavuotiaita, eivät he halunneet sotimaan. Entä jos hän jäätyy kuoliaaksi, kuten siskonsa? Sinun täytyy uskoa! Hän selviää, Lilli. Olen varma, että hän selviää. On vaikea uskoa, Marianne, kun luoja vie lapsen. lstu! Devilish fog outside. Can't see anything. If we don’t see anything, we can’t see either ! We could go in Languages ​​for a glass. Sounds good. There are still some great restaurants on the languages . Best night ever, Johannsen! Did you hear that, Kehding? Let's add gas! Russian submarine S-13 January 30, 1945, at 1:40. Where the hurry, young lady? My fiancé is waiting for me ... Where is the headgear of the uniform? I left it in my stuff. Why a jacket? Aren't you hot? I don't want to give it up. I am late. Sorry. I can not believe this! - Do you know him? He is from Königsberg. He is poison. What is he doing on this ship? - I ... Escaped? Avoids service. Stop, miss! Stop! Stop that woman! His name? - Galetschky, Erika, student. He struck the captain, a civilian, from here . Well, then ... '' Lord '' Kehding! What are you doing here? Where are your papers? Congratulations, congratulations ... Happy Birthday to You... How are you, radio officer? You should sleep, you are on a night shift! Fail, not before Languages. I then sleep in the grave. Radio Officer? - Lieutenant? Could you open this? The pressure drops, maybe sleet, the northwest wind strengthens. It becomes difficult to bypass the fitting. As long as we get past Hel. What happened to the convoy, Petri? Waiting at Hela. No worries. We can access Kiel easily. We don't have to watch. Let me think about the enemy. When the Kingdom is in trouble, submarines will save the day! The war is over before the Russians catch us. What do you think, Kehding? You know the Baltic Sea. I would like an official convoy. In war, one has to improvise. It must be new to you. Lieutenant-Commander. Gentlemen! What is going on? - Save us the bad news. My adjutant got a radio message intercepted . I got it when we left. What was in the message? The code is unknown. Maybe it's genuine then. The radio waves are full. Some of them are rubbish. One word was not encoded. What was that word? - Valhalla. Valhalla? - That's our code name. Where did the message come from? - We're trying to figure it out. Maybe the ship should be re-examined. What would we look for? Suspicious persons and hidden explosives. Have we been threatened? I should have been told! Take us to the Tongues, Mr. Kehding. What exactly are you waiting for, Petri? Start your search! Officer on duty! How many passengers do we have on board? Does anyone know? All decks are full, every hall and cabin. The landing was stopped when 5,000 came full. There are more passengers. So you finally got it 10,000. Are you happy? Can the war be satisfied? What do we have here? Erdmann, Marianne Erdmann. Sorry. Erika's fiancé, Captain Kehding, made his cabin available. Erika's groom? Really? That young man is my brother. The cabin is mine. I'm Harald Kehding. Those pictures, I didn't recognize you right away. I am sorry. No no. You stay here. The cabin is entirely for you. When are you due? The boy begins to be impatient. How do you know it's a boy? My husband wants a boy. He's on the front. I haven’t heard anything from him since Christmas. You seem familiar. Really? I had two daughters. They were in Hamburg with my wife in June -43 ... Everything is gone. We came from Tilsit, Lilli Simoneit and me. He took me with him, otherwise I wouldn't be here. Did you see the Russians? My husband’s sister was in Nemmersdorf in October. What he had to experience ... He had to hide among the bodies to survive. I crossed the bay at Pilla from Lill and the children. Lill's youngest did not survive. The girl froze to death in the crossing. Gustloff ... This ship is unsinkable. We will take care of you. From both of you. The fitting is in front. Do you see any ships in the convoy anywhere ? No - Neither do I, hell! No one is waiting. I can not believe this! For the Lord's sake, I wish this was over. We cannot continue without minesweepers or torpedo boats. You understand that too. Are we waiting? We will wait. Machines stop! Ready to anchor! Machines stop! Attention. We will continue our journey soon. There is no need to worry. We are waiting for escort ships. Attention. We will continue our journey soon. There is no need to worry. We are waiting for escort ships. Mum. Quietly ... The place is teeming with soldiers. Attention. We will continue our journey soon. We had a bakery in Neukuhren. As long as we have jobs, that's what we end up with. Stupidity, we get home, we beat the Russians back. Führer develops new weapons! I have seen the Russians. They do not give up what they have received. Attention. We will continue our journey soon. No reason to worry. We are waiting for escort ships. Lieutenant Kehding! What's wrong? Are you looking for suspicious items on the ship ? I have something for you. Burkat, party member. He led an auxiliary force whose work did not end in Gotenhafen. A woman has secretly boarded a ship. He is known for his defeat mood! Where is he? It's a problem. He spotted us and disappeared immediately. Name? Erika Galetschky? He must be found immediately. Thank you, Head of Department. Where from? It’s good to have a strong man next door. Mr Burkat, you have to help me - when I ask. Are there any doubts? You will not be disappointed, I promise you. No delay! We are looking for a blond auxiliary member, under thirty. You there! Stop! Berta! I heard there were auxiliaries on board. How fun to see you! We are transferred to the Languages. But what are you doing here? I thought you stayed in Gotenhafen? Well ... I'd be so lucky. You look tired. Sorry, but we're looking for a fleeing auxiliary - he may be hiding down there. Well, look for him then. And find him! Is he among you? Of course not. Did you hear that the Russians are chasing refugees in the lagoon . In Elbing, they gathered all the women and girls together. The coding is hard to figure out, but we try all the time. Where is your cousin? Erika? - Where is he hiding? He's not hiding. He is employed in Gotenhafen, as he should be. How well do you know him? She used to be her own sister, but the years separated us. His father had a bad effect. lsä was a bookseller. He has taken a big risk: escaping the tube, running away ... Koch, I'll give you one last chance! I don't know what you mean. But you know what we do for saboteurs. When was the last time you saw your cousin? Gotenhafenissa. The night I visited the countries after the air alarm. He kissed the man in public. Erika likes to challenge others, especially her superiors. If you hear anything, report it to me. Attention. We will continue our journey soon. There is no cause for concern. We are waiting for escort ships. What exactly are you waiting for? Safety convoy. Has the radio message already been cleared? We are working on it. Has anything been found in the sabotage? We are looking for a woman. You piss, if you hide things from me, I can't guarantee anything. What do you mean? Where is he? Where is who? - What do you think? Erika Galetschky! He stayed in Gotenhafen. Something went wrong! Went wrong! I don't think so ... He did not receive a transfer order. - What about it! I wanted him involved! Why you? Why isn't that cousin, radio operator Koch? How would I know? - How long have you known Koch? I do not know him. What about that Electric Store in Gotenhafen? Nothing. What do you want? Erika Galetschky is on board. That's all we know. But what are they planning? He and his cousin? You are delusional. Go to the hospital and forget Erika! I've known him since last summer. We met in Königsberg. He's here for me. You didn't know he was on the ship. He didn't tell you. You are confused. Don't try to blame him. How well do you know him? Are you listening? He only has two people, and they are on this ship. Radisti Koch. - Yes, and myself. We are at war. The enemy is everywhere. But war is not between us. There are rumors of an attack on Gustloff . They may be true. Erika means more to me than you can imagine. Leave her alone. How do you know he's not just taking advantage of you? It's not a matter of knowledge, Harald, I just feel that way. Leave him alone or you will no longer have a brother. Attention. The captain wants to remind. Keep your life jacket on hand at all times. Wear all clothing. This also applies to children. Come. Marianne! The little boy kicks like a sprinter! Good. See who's here. Hug! You survived. - I'm cold. Then you go straight to bed. Cover you properly. Well... Where is Erika? He's in Gotenhafen. I heard he's on board! How is it possible? He is being sought everywhere. - Dear God. I have to come back. Let me know if you hear anything. Erika is here. Thank God. Slowly moving forward. 90 degrees to the port. Slowly moving forward. 90 degrees to the port. Why did we set off? Command of the submarine department commander. We must not waste time. Is that the convoy you mentioned, Captain? You have to be grateful for what you get. Just imagine, to whom we are talking about a half hour. To the Commander of the Navy! We can't wait two days! With those ships? The sooner we leave, the better. But only on one ship. The other has to come back - because it has a leak and the minesweepers are in front of Pillau. We have to settle for torpedo boat Löween. Do you call that escort? What do you want? We are at war and we want to win. Don't you want to? That is not the case. - That's just the point. If you interfere with the transfer order, I must arrest you. 90 degrees. Why didn't you ask me? The idea was not mine, believe me. We have almost no protection at all. Should I just pray? Marianne, the creator did not make birth easy. Quickly. Who is it? - Kehding, open the door! Wait, I have to get dressed. How is the baby? Marianne finally fell asleep. How can I help? Who are you? Lilli Simoneit, Tilsitistä. If you play a game, you will regret it. Where is Erika Galetschky? Erika? I don't understand what you mean. He must stay in Gotenhafen. How well do you know him? Just a few days. Ever since we arrived in Gotenhafen. Erika helped us a lot. We are both from Königsberg. Old ties to the bookstore? No, I don't even know his family. Like I said, Erika was in the harbor when we arrived from Pillau. Is your husband on the front? Yes, I think of him every night. Well, then ... Erika Galetschky is believed to be on this ship. If you hear anything, just let me know. Do you understand? Attention. Captain's reminder. Keep your life jacket on hand at all times. Wear your clothes. This also applies to children. You should look after the children and they should stay with you. Attention. What are you doing? We haven't been together for a long time. All these people. This is a forbidden area. Obey! This is a new code. We sent it to Gotenhafen. Maybe it will be resolved there. Is there anything from the commander? There are problems with the reception. The hardware is frozen. Is there no connection? Hard to say. It is even colder in the west. Hopefully we don’t need a radio then. Lieutenant Kehding! Can I help? What is Koch doing here at this time? Radisti Koch? He's not here. How well do you know a man? He has only been on board for a few days. I didn't know he was here. Did you catch Galetschky? You are invited to the Führer's party! Did he find a woman? I don't think he even wants to. The woman is dealing with her brother. Men have changed. Can we try again? You know where my cabin is, Marieel. Half past nine, or nine. If the party is over then. But not later. Take your luggage with you. And not a word to anyone. I'll put everything on ... If you take me off. I can't let you through, try to understand. Be careful. I'll help you. Fold them smaller. You can't be here! Miss Galetschky. You want to meet Captain Kehding, don't you? He missed you in Gotenhafen. How did you get on the ship? Barely from the front door after all ... Could you please tell her that I'm here? Clear. Wait here. Parallel from Rixhoeft to Helela. Follow the weather. Clear. Westward. New course 262. New course 262. Message to T-Löwelle. New... No messages! Keep course 270 west. 270. Sorry? New course 262. We stay in deep water! Full speed, zigzag. Whatchamacallit! This is not for you to decide, Captain. I decided on a coastal route. There is no time! It is only a couple of hours longer, but only 15 meters deep. We get passengers to the beach if the need arises. The bombers are the only threat and they only attack the coast. Not even the Russians fly in this weather. We have anti-aircraft. And we would be safe from the submarines! Leave the submarines with us. The Russians are not advancing west of Memel. The inquiry claims another. I will not discuss this with you! Deep water route, zigzag at full speed. Wait a minute, Petri. Full speed is out of the question. You know that. The shaft system would explode. Up to 12 knots, no more. I don’t want to end up as a target here. Zigzag on this ship? The ship is 200 meters long, it doesn't work! Deepwater route! No, we're going along the coast! Let it be, Kehding. This is a tactical decision. Take control. Keep the course. We stay in deep water, pace on the side. Half the speed forward. I protest, Captain. The leading navigator has completed the course. You gave your word! Hellmut. - I can't believe you're here! You promised to marry me. I won't let you go anymore. Sterup shows the way to my cabin. My brother and I don't use it. Lilli Simoneit and Marianne are there. Lock the door. If something happens, he will bring you to me. How long do I wait? To Flensburg or Languages ​​- there you can be with my mother, it is safe there. Sterup! We have gathered here - to celebrate the anniversary of the rise to power. Let us listen to the Führer himself from the Chancellery of Berlin! ... get up, anywhere, under any circumstances - until our deeds are rewarded with victory. Any news? - No. Has progress been made with Traudl and the radio ? He packed his bags and meets a radio operator in this cabin. At the moment, I am appealing to the German people - but primarily to the old allies and all the soldiers. Now we have to go to the maternity ward. It starts at any moment. Be strong. I expect every healthy German to give his all in this fight. I look forward to every sick and weak ... Stay here and open the door only for Mrs. Simoneit or me. Is it clear? Thank you. I expect every farmer to give everything he has - bread for soldiers and workers in this battle. Until we can once again honor the heroes of this war - laying a wreath on their grave and saying - '' You were victorious. '' If we stay united - we are allowed to stand before our Creator and ask for mercy and blessing. A nation with nothing but those capable of fighting - and those who are able to work and who are willing to sacrifice - and driven only by the will to restore to our people its pride and with it the future of life itself. Shut up there, the Führer is talking! We're looking for a maternity ward. ... and our desire to sacrifice and our talent - defeat them in the end. We will overcome these difficulties ... Stilow Lighthouse is already visible. We are moving at a good pace against the wind and waves. We pass Swinemünde in the morning, after that we are safe. Open up! Open up! Open the door! Well even something - Miss Galetschky! How do you know my name? Do you think you are witty? Are you Hellmut's brother? What do you want here? I don't understand what you mean. What are you going to do on this ship. It's damn cold here. Well, someone up there seems to like the Führer. We don't get anything, but the National Radio broadcast works! We got something through. Are we on the same course? Doesn't look good. Sender? Nothing. I tried a couple of times. And the message came through as it was? Just like this. Rest, Captain. I'll take care of this for the time being. How could you sleep on a night like this? In the morning the worst is over! Captain, from the radio room! Bring him here right away! You have to react to this! What is this? Minesweepers are on the same course. Open formation, risk of collision. Where did this come from? Radiohuoneesta. The sender is not mentioned. We'll know soon. Wasn't it coded? We'll know that soon. I just wanted to know how close they really are. Where did this come from? Impossible to know. The equipment is frozen. Good thing it came through. Who sends this? We do not know. We tried everything. At what frequencies? Intelligence, Radio Command Center, Submarine Department . Not connected right now. lhan the same We have to act, fast! Löwe has certainly got it too. Let's ask them. Ask the torpedo boat Löwe: Did you get a collision warning? Do you know the sender? Navigation lights on! Stop! Stop. How dare you? I am responsible for the ship. Then turn on the lights. No sender, unresolved messenger , hardware frozen - it is not a warning. It read the code name Valhalla, yes it means something. When do we get a radio connection? Hard to say, the sleet continues. Thank you. Get off. If we keep talking, we will end up with them eventually! Neither we nor the torpedo boat Löwe has seen anything - but the lights would reveal us! The soldiers make that decision. Not just the captain to decide. - Careful now, Kehding. I am going to take this ship safely to Kiel. And would you risk a collision? I can't allow it. Navigation lights on! No lights! Minesweepers in an open formation are like a brick wall. As long as we’re not sure, we should just add a lookout. We cannot risk 10,000 passengers. That's why ... We turn on the lights! Confirm the command Mr. Kehding, the officer is waiting! I will not give such an order. Confirm the order immediately! Well, I'm waiting. Officer, navigation lights on! Do it fast! Now go to rest. The last few days have been exhausting for us. I'm not resting here. I am directing this ship! You're not in turn, Kehding, leave the bridge immediately! I will bring you to court for martial law here! The Navy! Torpedo launch. Torpedo launch. Did the torpedo boat get an answer? Their hardware is also frozen. The collision warning didn’t even get there. Anything else? They don’t know what’s going on underwater . The system failed. Great! We are deafblind, and we are lit like a Christmas tree. Is the radio connection OK? - Is not. Has the code been resolved? Not a chance. Who received the message? Radisti Koch. Koch? Where is he? - At rest. Where is his cabin? - In the port, the last one. Keep me updated. Clear. Why did you turn on the lights, Captain? I didn't light. That's why I'm off the bridge. Double the scouts. Every 25 meters . Are there enough men? We keep an eye on everything that moves - except waves and clouds. Your female friend is waiting for you in her cabin. Others are in labor. Thank you. Six! You received a strange collision warning. The hardware is frozen, the radio is not working, but you received a message. It wasn't even coded. The officer acknowledged it. Sometimes we just get messages. It wasn't even coded. Was not. Let's get it up and running. Where are you going? I'm nowhere, waiting for one. Who wants to sleep alone? Erika is on the ship, what do you say to that? I don't believe you. You must not leave your cabin. This is an order. I came because of Hellmut, why don't you believe me? You forgot your cousin. I haven't met Hagen in years. You met him a few times in Gotenhafen. What were you talking about? What would you talk about now with a cousin you barely know? Who did he meet at that electric store? I don't know what you're talking about. I am sorry. Your hostile attitude is known. I'm not hostile. Why do you say that? Ask my cousin. Come with me. Sorry. Erika. She is also from Tilsit, this Marianne. She is also from Tilsit, this Marianne. Her Werner is on the front, and doesn’t even know anything about the child. Marianne becomes a teacher, just like her mother. I didn’t want to board, and now my baby is being born here! Looking good. I'm talking to a medical officer. That girl. Is she pregnant too? No, he just can't be alone. He has experienced hardships. I understand. The Russians. Raukka park. Can it be? No thanks. There is nothing there. The minesweepers had already passed. Then turn off the lights. Officer, eclipse back. Keep your distance. Follow the signs. Where is Lilli Simoneit? - There. Come with me! What are you doing? Kalli. Prepare for battle. Prepare for battle. What does he want from you, Hagen? Nice to see you, Erika. You are bad at acting. You knew he was on the ship. You had planned everything! I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but that's not true. Where are the explosives? - Explosives? Hagen? Ampukaa torpedot! Fire! You just look at him and tell if you saw him in Gotenhafen. What if I don't remember him? - Do not worry. What if he reveals me? - You're completely safe. What was that? Torpedo! We are being shot! Out! Where is Hellmut? Koch! He got my gun! Hellmut. No! Hagen ... - Don't look! Go for the boats! Take the lieutenant on the boats! What is happening here? I have to take care of the ship, go to the boats. I don't want to die! Mom, Mom! Out! Run! Quickly now. Down the stairs! Get on the boat before they fill up! I'll stay with you! - I can't take you with me! I'm waiting for you. - Be sensible now. There are not enough boats! Women quickly into boats. This can not be true. Where is Johannsen? Now to help with the evacuation! Can you hear the engine room? Where is Johannsen? Who is responsible here? Close the bulkheads! It's already done, Kehding. Lifeboat operators are drowning right in front of the ship! Captain, the radio has been dismantled, and the keys thrown overboard! Evacuate and get a shortwave radio! Bow and stern below waterline. There is no access to the lower decks. The machines have stopped. We sink fast! Calm down, you need to be calm in these situations . There is nothing left for you to do here, Kehding. Lifeboats. Where is Johannsen? Only women and children in lifeboats! Beds first! Take blankets and medicines. Stay calm. This stops the contractions. Do your best. Karl! Mum Karl! Karl! Mum! Karl! Mum! Karl! Karl! Erika! Erika! Are you hurt? Do you know where Kalli is? You have to get on the boat before they are full. We will all die! No. We just have to get out. Only women and children! Men, stay behind! Behind! Only women and children! This girl! Take him! Women and children only. I'll hold him for a moment. I'll hand him to you. No! My children! I want my children! Don't push! She has my child! Let it through. Give me my baby! I want my children! Give it to my children. Please! Come back! She has my children! There are more boats on the sun deck! There. Go there. Go in line. There. Move. Captain! Captain, the boats are full. They are no longer on the sun deck! What are you doing? There are hundreds trapped on the walkway! You won't survive it! I will see what I can do. What are you doing here, Johannsen! The German captain will not leave the ship. On a warship, the commander is allowed to save himself to continue - fight, but this is Gustloff! I demand courage! Valor! Like you, Escher? This is not my ship. It's not mine either. The cruise is now over, so you can lead the ship. So don’t expect courage from me. The boat must be removed! No, we can't do that. If we detach the boat, people will be crushed under it. We wait until the water rises! Captain Johannsen? Absolutely miss, this is Captain Johannsen! Where is Hellmut? Hellmut Kehding! Where is he? Erika. Hellmut is on the bridge! Finally, someone takes responsibility. I will never see him again. If you survive, so will he! There is no space here, go elsewhere! Hug. Hug. We kill them, Harald, we kill them all! Submarine! This can not be true. We have to stay together, Harald. Together we will survive! Listen to me. Find Erika and stay with her. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot like me! Hold on, Harald! Harald! Harald! Harald! Give me your hand! The boat is full. Go away. Go, go away! Please! There's someone in uniform! - Pull him up. Give me your hand. Now you can help us. Go away, there's no room here. We don't want to sink. Stop. Help them up. There is still room here. Push, push. Once again. Looking good. Push. Mr. Kehding, Marianne gives birth, you have to help. Where is he? At the front of the boat. Well done. The child is born. It's a boy. Kehding. Give him to the captain. Marianne. Kehding. I promise. Marianne. Marianne, don't give up. Mr. Kehding. - Yes. He said the boy must be given to you. A ship! We are here! We are here! This way! Erika. Out of the way. Let me through. Listen, I have to ... In single file. Hold on tight. Come come! I will never see Kalli again. Yes you can see. Come on, we're almost there. Try now. You must not give up. Come on, Lilli. Please. I can't take it anymore. This is the captain. We are on a merchant ship. We no longer have blankets or dry clothes. Hot tea is available. Injured persons should report to the ship's personnel. Put this on. Would you like to hold a boy? You have to get used to it. Well. It needs its father. The child instincts immediately. Father. You need to stay awake. Now that we are safe. Do not fall asleep. Lilli, stay awake. Lilli. I'm looking for tea. It warms you. Do not fall asleep. Lilli! Lilli, I'll get you some tea. Attention, this is a Navy Announcement. Due to overcapacity and the submarine threat , we will have to change the route. We have no connection with other ships. We head towards Swinemünde. Come here. You two, come with us. Take your baby and stay close so you don’t get noticed! Clear. Stop! That boy is coming with us. He is not yet sixteen. What is this? His mother died. Name? Kehding, Captain Gustloff. We are on our way to Hamburg. Wait a minute. Would you watch this? Boy stay here! He lost his whole family! What happens here? This man would like to go to Hamburg. Civil? Shipping company South Hamburg. I need to get in touch with naval transportation. To Engelhardt's office. To Rear Admiral Engelhardt! This young man is fit for service. He stays. Give that baby to me. The boy is with me. Get your hands off it! You do not understand what we have experienced. Take that baby away. What kind of war do children go through? Name? My name is Kehding. You better remember it! Kehding was there. That kind of officer can't know about that. I'll go. Let the man go. Take him. Hug! We'll meet again. You're going for it. Whether it's small. Are you a father? Is the child yours? Of course. I don't believe this. Where is the child's mother? What is the child's name? Name? Harald ... Harald Kehding. Take care of the baby, I'll pick it up. Sorry. Kehding. We meet again. What a miracle! Guard, stop that man! You won't survive this! - Stop! No Trespassing. The reason was yours! You killed them all! Careful, Kehding. The Navy is not interested in your shouting. Go home and forget what happened. Forget? Do you just think about it? Listen, what happened was awful enough. Digging into things doesn’t help anyone. You are only hurting yourself. I have not done anything wrong. You took the lead from me! Stop. - Let me go! Let me go. Have everyone gone crazy? I'm not going to allow it! Calm down, man. All right. I will handle this. Come back to your seat. Get off. - All right. For heaven's sake, Kehding, what a disaster! I came as soon as I could. Gustloff, another anniversary! This could not be worse. It seems that the Russians want people to stay at home. How's your brother? My apologies. He was a brave man. How the hell was the Russian submarine there? There is no talking about it here. Come with me. The submarine was well hidden. Very skillfully. But how could you be located in that weather? The navigation lights were on. We were seen from afar. Navigation Lights? That is irresponsible! So did I. My powers were taken away. We received a collision alert from an unknown source - in plain language, but only torpedoes appeared! Before you left, your brother received a message. It could not be opened. We intercepted the message, but - we had problems with the code. When we got it open yesterday, we tried to get in touch with you. Our equipment was frozen. If you received the message encrypted - then that means someone on board knew the code before us. Radisti Koch. It was a trap! Maybe he had to get you - to turn on the navigation lights as the submarine approaches. We know that Koch has been a prisoner of war for the Russians since October. It's from Gotland. This is madness, Kehding! He shot himself. Damn it. Two days! If they had just waited, you would be safe in Languages. I want to take this to court. No, you don't. It's out of the question! Thousands drowned there! That would be suicide! No investigation. Why? Don't risk the truth - morality, or how did it go? If you tell anyone about this, Captain, you are a dead man! Erika! Sorry. Erika! Kehding. Forget the right to war. Please. Should I forget what happened? How could I do that? You noticed last night what you as an individual are capable of. We need you. Shipping cannot lose a great captain. Don't fool yourself, Kehding. This war has already been lost. But there are thousands out there who need your help. Think about it, Kehding. Get up now. Until May 1945, Hellmut led large ships across the Baltic Sea - and brought with him to the source the safety of nearly 50,000 people. In the summer of 1945, he and Erika married and adopted a son. Captain Johannsen was released from service in Swinemünde - without formal interrogations. Although submarine commander Captain Petri was interrogated - accident, it was not seen as directly his responsibility. Kalli, who survived the accident, also survived the battles with Stettin. He was taken prisoner, but he managed to escape to Sweden. More than 9,000 people died in that accident. Most of them are women and children. The accident was never formally investigated. The film is based on true events.
