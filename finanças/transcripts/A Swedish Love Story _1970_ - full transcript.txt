You need one of these... Women go mad for it! Ingvar. Lasse. Birger. Roger. - I could do with some help! - Coming! A SWEDISH LOVE STORY That's my youngest boy. The eldest one has a repair shop. He's doing well. He has five employees. And he has a son, a crafty kid. 15 years old. He got a moped when he turned 15. All the kids have to have them. But that wife of his! She does nothing but water the flowers. But they can afford it, so why not? You can't... Wait until the Social Democrats get in. Things will change then! Let's go to the park, there's more space there. Lasse! Lasse! - Not too bad, thanks for asking. - I hope you're better soon. Thank you. - Hi, Granddad! - So, you come to visit an old man? - Where's Dad and the others? - Over there. Here he is! Hello! Turn round! I'm heading over to the bridge. There's a pastry shop over there. Verner knows it. Eva, darling... Don't be sad. There, now... Hi, Eva. Happy birthday. Four cheers for Eva! - Where's Roger? - Here. - Such a nice family! - Verner has been here before. Verner has been here before. Hey, Lasse! You can take that path down. Looks like we have some entertainment! I thought I saw a glimpse of Verner. Hi, Lasse! Not too bad, thanks. Hello! Thank you. We can sit down here. - Granddad can sit there. - I'll take the corner seat. - Isn't this nice?! - And here are some flowers. Thank you. I'll let the nurse take care of them. - Isn't there a waitress? - No, you serve yourself here. So, what do we want? - I want coffee. - That sounds good! - A ham sandwich... - I don't know if they have that. Damn kid! Are you trying to kill the old man? Can I have another one? - Do you want anything, Eva? - No, thanks. - Do you want coffee? - Not me. - Seven coffees. - Seven. Shut up! Can't you shut that dog up? Hey! The dog there. Can't you shut it up? It was my right elbow. I don't know why you thought it was the left. But it was my left knee I injured when you were seven. Pär! Ask if they have an egg and anchovy sandwich! Pär! Salami is OK, too. - Don't you want anything? - No thanks. - Did they have anchovies? - No, only ham. Here's your little cup. And get rid of this tray. - Annika's going to be there, too. - Yes. Wow! What a flame! Did you see that flame? Do I have to climb over the table to get a sandwich? I guess it won't be Song before you're discharged, Granddad. I'm not going to be discharged from here. Why would I? I don't want to leave. I don't want to leave! This world isn't made for me. It's not made for lonely people. Do you hear me? This world isn't made for lonely people. Once I thought it could be... but it isn't! I thought that life would one day be just as good for everyone... but that hasn't happened. Do you hear me? - Don't run anyone over! - Watch out, then. Am I doing all right? More? There are 200,000 birds in this town. And I only know seven. - Get a move on then! - You just have to be tough. Cheers. I wanted to be an airline stewardess. The first time, they said they'd get back to me. Then a friend of mine said, "You're too tall." And I never heard from them. The next year, I got ill when they were having entry examinations. By the time I got better, the classes had started and it was too late. The next year, the same friend said, "You could take a guide class. "It's almost the same thing." So I did. I got there, and the instructor said, "Do you speak English?" A dark-skinned man with dark glasses. There was a ceiling fan blowing. "Sure," I said. "I know a little English and a little German." I was awfully nervous. There were a bunch of other girls there who were just as nervous. He had us turn this way and that. They said they'd get back to us, but I never heard from them. Sometimes I feel panicky because I'm not married. When I see my old school friends with prams. I feel like... people are staring at me. - Does an Annika live here? - Yes, why? Hey! She lives here! Clear off. I certainty don't have such terrible aim! I want to know more about the striker. - Can you help with this door? - Coming. - Strikers are good for scoring goals. - Aren't they all? - Geneva v Marseille. - Away win! They're in the wrong place. Take that one, we’ll swap them round. - Frem Copenhagen v Groningen? - Home win! - SV Fürth v Wiener SK? - Draw! - Shouldn’t they hang the other way? - No. Let go. Now! They swing a little unevenly. That's what happens when you waste your free time on it. If we'd won the Lottery, we wouldn’t be hanging up this old crap! GunhiId, this was your idea. What do you want this crap for? It doesn't serve any purpose. And you didn't lift a finger! I don't like the Iook of them. No... Come on. - Hi. - Hi. - The ballon burst. - Aww... - How are you? - Fine. You? OK. - I think he's tired now. - It's almost time for his nap. - Hi. - Hi. Roger's balloon burst coming up the stairs. How are you? Just fine. - How about you? - OK. - Are you beating the dog? - Don't get hysterical again! - Are you moving in? - Shut up! - Annika, hurry up! - Come home early or I won't sleep. - Those kids will ruin that car. - Go and stop them. - I don't care about the car. - Really? - Hi, Iceman. What do you drive? - A Peugeot, why? - They're terrible. How's work? - Fine. Wrong business. If you want to drive a dented car, fine! Annika! This place is a morgue... What's that on your neck? A lovebite? - Where are you going? - The Domino. - You like dancing? - Yeah. - Who are you meeting there? - Lotta. - Aren't you meeting a boy? - Yeah. - Anyone special? - No. I wanted to. I don't know why I didn't. Everyone says that. Me too. I was there an hour, waiting for him. But when he came, I didn't talk to him. And when he came towards me, I turned away. Then he left. Too bad. "Fortunately, your problem isn't unusual. We all do things we regret. "Ask yourself what you want, and do it. "Then you’ll know if you're unhappy for a reason." - That's just the way it is. - Maybe... Too bad you didn't talk to him. - It just didn't happen. - Say you don't get another chance? What do you want me to tell her? I want to talk to her, I just can't. Tell him I wanted to say hi, but... didn't. I don't want to admit it. It feels silly. Why not? I don't want to admit that I... - I'll tell her. - No! No! - You live up there? - Yes, but on the courtyard side. Is Pär here? Pär! You have a visitor! - That's not on. - What? - Bumping into people like that. - Like what? You hit my knee. And you're making trouble. Knock it off. Where can I buy cigarettes? Annika. In the room behind me, your mother is lying... ..destitute. And I'm a bastard. - Hi. - Hi. - Where have you been? - Out. I don't feel too happy. I'm sure it’ll be better when we get a new flat. Go to bed now. I'm going to get that bastard. You all just stood there watching! And her... I don't give a shit about her! How can I go out with her now? I can't take it! You just watched! He doesn't give a shit about me... Pär! Pär! Wait! Wait! No! Are you coming? You'd better get ready. Don't you see how stupid you are? Idiot! - Annika, who is it? - Pär. Go in and sit in the living room. There are soft drinks in the fridge. Hello. - Hello. - Hi. Aren't you going to get the pop? - What are you going to be? - I don't know. - You haven't made up your mind? - No. - I see you're a musician. - Yeah, guitar. Then you must know Guitar Boogie. No. Do you know anything Spanish? No. Come Prima? No. That... No. And you don't know what you want to be? - Did you take a bath? - No, I just did my hair. Annika... Don't let him stay too Song. - Would you like a sandwich? - Sure. - Cheese or salami? - Salami. Is this a good look for me? How about this? Did you make these yourself? They're good. - Go. - One, two, three... That's the only chord I know. I can't do it. Want some sherry? Peddling shoelaces? Go to hell, you bastard! - Hi. - Hi. It's only Eva. - Hello. - Hi. Did it scare you when I came? - Why? - I don't know. - Have you had fun? - Yeah. And they're coming tonight. - How old are you again? - Almost 14. I came up because... I don't know why I came. I'm so lonely! On this path I choose to roam Free and high, it leads me home Touched by the sun's eternal hand Like a sea of mighty pines Endless ancient mountain climes Stretch before you in endless glory Sweden My fatherland If only I had money! I'd travel somewhere. We couldn’t afford to go to Spain. It's not going well for dad.

Park your moped and I'll take the bag. - Will it be a big party? - Pretty big. This is my dad's fishing spot. Once he caught 18 pike here. I bet he'll ask your dad to come and fish here. - My Dad doesn't like fishing. - He doesn't? - What does he like doing? - Hunting. Ow! Bedtime! Good night. Let's go to bed. Are you sure you want the bottom bunk? OK, then. We’ll get up around 7:30. - Honey?

It was the first day of school and the teacher was writing down the kids' names as they came in. "What's your name?" "Nisse KarIsson." "And you?" "OIIe KarIsson." "And you?" "Sven KarIsson." "My goodness, are you triplets?" "Yes." "Why is your voice so deep?" "Mum only had two breasts, so I had to suck Dad's." What about this one? A farmer and a farm hand are sat in the kitchen, getting ready to eat breakfast, porridge and milk. Then... Let me see... Yeah, the farmer... opened the window and threw out the porridge. The farm hand saw that, took the milk and threw it out too. "What on earth are you doing?" says the farmer. "I thought we were going to have a picnic." This is very good. Did you make this salad yourself? - Look, here comes John! - Hi! Eva! Hello! Have a seat and I'll heat up the food. Yes, there's food. - John HeIIberg. - Hello.

You have electricity out here. Arne! Come and drink a toast with the refrigerator salesman. - Cheers! - John is his name. Cheers, you old banger merchant! He's being rude, this fridge pusher. Cheers, John. We’ll catch a fish later, fresh from the lake. Who needs a fridge? Cheers, John! Bring your old car round and I'll paint it for you. They're supposed to be cold. - Even in the country. - If you have a basement... Who's sleeping in the tent? The ones with the jumpers? - Wine... It's not my strong point. - It's a question of temperature. Watch out! As I said, there's nothing wrong with the basement. Ice cold! But we can always give it a try. - Is it plugged in? - Yes. Didn't it light up? I'll turn the plug around. - Did it light up now? - No. Shit! Do you want coffee? I was going to set off some fireworks. - Should I do it now? - Go ahead. John, did you bring a fishing rod? Shut up! Have you seen this before? John. John? Cheers! BertiI, cheers! - Things are about to liven up. - BertiI, light up. Be patient. You have to be careful. It might be damp. - I saved it from New Year. - Light it. - Oh, I didn't see anything. - Do another! No, I only had one. You can't watch from in there! John, did you see it? - EIsa? - Yes. I want to make a speech. And if I got to make that speech, it would be to everyone on earth. All of humanity! I'd say that the whole world’s just full of bastards. Do you hear me? Bastards!

HaraId! - There's a hat floating here. - It's not mine. - Does everyone have their hats? - Yes! Whose is this one, then? That John, he's such a Ioudmouth. I think we're all a little that way. Weren't you a little hard on him? I'll treat him to a drink later. Do you think it's John's hat? One of those little pointy ones. - BertiI! Where are you? - Here, out on the spit. John! - John! - No! This way, then. Arne! Where have they been? Fishing, I think. Lasse, here's the rocket!
