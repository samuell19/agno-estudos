Not so fast. That's better. Hello, John. Yeah, I've been wanting to speak to you. Because you said it was going to be done last week, that's why. Don't give me that horseshit. I've been in business for 50 years, and you're a rank amateur, that's what the hell you are. What do you mean? You... When? Well, why didn't you say so? Well... That's a different story, of course. No, I under... I get it. Okay, yeah, yeah. We can make the transfer this afternoon. Sure, why not? Yeah, you got it. Very good. Take care. That was John. There's been some delays, is all. No big deal. He needs some money for additional bank fees. Hey, would you grab me a tie? Uh, we're going to go into town. A real nice tie. My handsome man. - Hey, Adina. - Good morning, Bunny. - Good morning, Adina. - Oh, good morning, Ethan. We'll be out for a few hours. - Toodles. - Have a nice day. What am I going to do with that goddamn John Collins? I mean, how many ways can he drag this thing out? How many stupid mistakes can this son of a bitch make? He's a rank amateur, that's what he is. It's amateur hour! I can't stand mediocrity. Try not to dwell on it. Well, he's a silly son of a bitch. I don't know what to do with him. ♪ Dream ♪ I don't know whether to track him down and strangle him, or, what's that stuff you send?

You stopped paying for your unit months ago, and it is against policy to have two in a single. You're going to have to pack up your things, William. Now, you listen to me, you lousy tramp. I am a son of God and you can't make me evic... Haven't you spent enough of my mother's money? Horseshit! I love Adina and she loves me, that's what matters. You want to leave your mother alone here in this torture chamber? - It's time to leave, sir. - You better back off, - you Nazi thug. - William, William, you need to calm down. - You're going to get yourself in trouble, dear. - I don't care, these sons of bitches. Who the hell do these people think they are? Maybe we could talk to them, make them understand what our arrangement is. - You can't reason with the Gestapo. - Gestapo? Don't worry, I'm not going to leave you in here with these Nazi pigs, I promise. I'm getting you out as soon as the Jamaica deal is done. This isn't forever. Your mother was saved in 1941 and she'll be saved again. - Ridiculous. - Vichy scum. - Okay, that's enough, let's go. - I can walk myself! I don't want to see you at this facility again, William. I'm a free agent, I answer to no one. Excuse me. Yeah, what's up? Looking for a place. Son of a bitch! Mm! Uh, oh, sorry, what? What's up? I'm looking for a place to live. Right on, right on, okay. You came to the right place. Let me call my boss. Spence. Yeah, we got a guy upfront, potential resident. Cool. Okay. He'll be right down. This is how you act at work? - Beetle. - Ugh! Were you talking to me the whole time? Okay. Hey, there! Spencer Holloway. I'm the director here at Gramercy Towers. - William Selig. - What... Oh. Sorry, I just... finishing my cabbage salad. Nice to meet you. If you want to come to my office and we can have a little chatty-chat-chat? You're a child. I look younger than I am, believe me. I have a degree in gerontology from BYU. I am versed in the elderly. A Mormon. We prefer LDS. Come, this way. How is, uh, how's your life going? There you go. What do you think? I mean, charming in here, huh? This is what I call your entryway into heaven. I mean, look at the light in this room. It's all natural, comes straight from the sun. Just so you know, if you any additional furniture, - we can have it delivered. - I don't. All right. Real nomad, I can respect that. Where can I get some decent toilet paper around here? Are you out? I'll have Marina bring it up. We're supposed to be... I'm sorry, it's supposed to be stocked. Not out, this is cheap stuff, like sandpaper. Well, it's what we've got. It's no good. Okay, well it's what we've got, so... I don't like your tone. You're right... you're right, I'm very sorry, sir. I don't want to speak like that to anyone. I apologize. Hopefully, you'll forgive me. I tell you what? Why don't I leave you here, and you can just settle in. Just take in the space, okay. Oh, also do not forget wine mixer tonight. It's going to be a great time. It'll be a great opportunity for you to mingle with the residents, and here's the kicker. Female to male ratio, four to one. I've already got a lady friend. Hey there, sailor. Huh? Well, you're a Navy man, aren't you? Well, I was. Fought Hirohito's boys all across the Pacific. I was on the Hornet. Wow, that's something! Were you on it at Midway? Surely was. Sunk right out from under us. Spent the rest of the fight marooned at a goddamn listening post. Well, it could have been worse. Ain't that the truth. I'm William Selig. Jean Chandler. They call me Jeanie. Well, aren't you the sight, Jeanie? Oh, stop. You have to forgive them, uh... We're not used to new fellas coming here and... well, especially handsome ones. I won't be staying. This is temporary. I'm going to move into my own place as soon as I close this deal I've been working on. Oh, well, it's nice to have you here now. I, uh, was around the Pacific a bit myself. I was a USO girl. - Were you? - Sure was.

Well, it looks like you still got it. Yeah, you better believe it, buster. Well, I got to take a leak. Oh. Um... Will you be at the wine mixer tonight? We're celebrating this month's birthdays. Yeah, sure. I hope so. It was wonderful meeting you, William. Boo. I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight to celebrate the birthdays of Agnes, Doris, and Dick. I hope you live another 100 years. All right, so here's the deal. We got a lot of wine tonight, and we got a lot of partying to do. So let's have fun. Let's get this party started. Hit the lights. DJ Iggy, give it to us! Now, that's a nice piece. Most of these old broads are falling apart. You have to screw them in the dark. But not her. She's holding together just fine. I'd leave the lights on for her. That's a disgusting way to speak about a child of God.

Or are you stationed at the base? I live in 304. 304... Oh, oh. You have to forgive me. I have those senior moments. Not me, I'm hale and hearty as a young buck. I can see that. I can really see that. Hoo-hoo! What a night, everybody. - Hope you had fun, I'm exhausted. - Come on, let's get out of here. But, uh, yeah, you don't have to go home but you can't stay here. So, uh, beat it. You are in trouble, sailor. Look at this joker! Hey, learn to walk, idiot! Jeez. - Are you all right, William? - Hmm? I'm fine. What have you been doing with yourself? I'm reading Anna Karenina for the ninth time. The Russian version. Does she commit suicide every time? Where are we going? Taking you to Dixie Diner. No. What about Canter's? No, I want to see your place. Some other time. But I want to see it now. It's not your kind of joint. Where are we going to make love? Christ, I'm starving. Take me there, or take me back to Argyle. Oh, this will never do. Here we are, talking about where are we going. We have these little elms, that we come to... - Oh, just a minute, excuse me. - Okay. Adina... this is my new friend Jean Chandler, Jeanie, this is my friend Adina Kurchik. How do you do, Adina? Hello. Can we go have breakfast, now? Shall we? So, how did you two meet? We met at the last place that I lived. He lived in my apartment. Only because I got kicked out of my room. Such a shame you have to live here, now. It's a complete downgrade. I mean they don't even have jam, it's jelly. They treat us very nicely here. These eggs are much too salty. You want something else? I think they're delicious. Adina is very particular when it comes to food. I'm not particular, I just appreciate fine cuisine. Well, you don't have to eat it. William, how did you sleep last night? Just fine. I did, too. It was the best sleep I had in years. I heard Paul Anka's appearing in Las Vegas next month. You don't say? Remember how we used to listen to him in bed? Maybe we should get going, Adina. - If you don't like this, we could... - No, it's fine. William, uh, what is it you like to do for fun? Fun is for children. I'm a very serious-minded man, that's why God took notice of me. Because I get things done. I'm full. - You barely touched... - I think I'd like a bowl of ice cream. Excuse me, miss? Could I please have a bowl of vanilla ice cream? Sorry, we don't serve ice cream at breakfast. I don't see why it should be a problem. You must have some in the freezer. Now please, bring me a bowl. Excuse me, you're being very rude. The food plan is for residents only. Well, then I'll pay for it. Samantha, she's a friend of mine, I'm sorry. I totally forgot to explain to her the rules here. Come on, Adina, why don't we go get ice cream someplace else? I don't see why a bowl of ice cream should be so complicated. Oh, oh, do you mind if I come along? I, uh, get tired of being cooped up in here. I would too. Oh, there was this fabulous lecture on Greek vase painting at Argyle yesterday. I'm sad you missed it. They had a professor from the university come. I love art. My favorite painting is the one with the beautiful flowers in water. Oh, makes me emotional just to think about it. I love Vincent van Gogh. - Water Lilies? - Mm-hmm. That's by Claude Monet. Oh, of course. I get the two of them mixed up. My husband and I had a collection of etchings and paintings from our travels all around the world. I'm more fond of the Baroque period myself. The artists are much less childish in their approach. I've had bad experiences with art. - There you go. Have a nice day. - Thank you. You're not saying much, Jean. Who is Adina? Just an old companion. Well, it doesn't look like that at all. She's a good friend. Look, I've grown very fond of you, William. But I am not comfortable getting involved... as long as there is another woman in the picture. I can't just leave an 82-year-old woman on her own. She lives amongst Nazis. Do you realize that? What are you talking about? I'm talking about Adina being a Jewish lady. So what? What does it matter what she is? What does it matter? Six million Jews, that's what matters. Well... a relationship is between a man and a woman. It's a couple, not a trio! Who said? I don't subscribe to Christian dogma. It isn't religious, William. It's human. It's matters of the heart. I know what my heart says. Oh, well, goodnight, William. Hello, everyone. We're going to start today with each of us creating a personal password. Now, make sure you choose something that you can remember easily. I think I'll make mine "Valley of the Dolls." Oh, that's funny. Are you in the industry? I'm a filmmaker. Oh, that's wonderful. I'm a dramatic actress. I could have guessed that. What are some of your films? I've made too many to list them all. Oh, that's impressive. I do miss working. Well, you could still work. I know some people. Casting directors, producers. All right, that's enough. - What? - I said, that's enough. Okay, cowboy. William, you're embarrassing me. Go sit down. This clown is a pornographer. Hey, pal! I've had it with you. You walk around here like you're a gift to the... Oh, my God, William! Don't fuck with me, porno man! We don't accept violence here. I'm above the law. Nobody's above the law. The Mormon Book is not real. I'm a son of God, the actual God, and He's promised me the universe. Will, I'm concerned about you. I think you may need some help that Gramercy Towers is ill-equipped to provide. Bullshit! You're the one that needs help, you're deluded by a book of lies and a party to the deprivations of the Nazi psychopath killer motherfuckers! I've recommended you for psychiatric evaluation at Verdugo Hills. You'll be visiting there for three weeks. No! You can't kick me out, Jeanie needs me! You're going to leave her to that pornographer? You can't, I won't let you. I won't let you, you son of a bitch! - I'll kill you first. - All right, let's go, let's go. Get your hands off me, you Nazi bastard! I overcame the world 6,000 years ago. It is I who overcame the world, not Hitler... who was blessed by the Pope. Adam and Eve transgressed, because they went to Lucifer but not me. I'll teach those two phonies. Somebody get up there. I'll go up there. I'll go up there. I'll take care of it. I'll get them, I'll get them. Shut up! God dammit! I'm going to club you with this goddamn chair. Now, knock it off! No, no, no. You're fucking this all up. We're at the finish line here. Look, you just keep finding pieces of the tiger's face, I'll finish up the jungle part of it, okay? Then we're home free. William Selig? Yeah, that's me. Your observation is over. It's about stinking time! Thank you, Richard Nixon. I'm here to pick up my Mercedes. It was towed off of Gramercy Place three weeks ago. What's the license plate number? Uh... 8Q49935. It was sold at auction. What do you mean it was sold? No, no, no, come on. For how much? I want to buy it back. Who did you sell it to? We don't have that information, but it was sold for 100 dollars. 100 dollars? God almighty, no! Goddamnit, Richard Nixon! What is it you're looking for, exactly? Something with a lot of room in the back and not too expensive. You've got a good eye, these are our compact vans which are great for moving things around, of course. Yeah, I won't be moving around a lot. Hello? John! You better have good news for me. Your fanny's on the line, you hear? Hey, you better have that money in my account by dusk. You... what? Are you... this afternoon? Great, yeah, yeah, it's about time. All right! Another 200? No, no, no! Now, you... no, no. Oh... What, a wire fee? What? Oh, well, okay. Oh, what? All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, okay. Well, if I leave right now and head over to Hollywood, I can find a Western Union that's open. Jean. Jeanie. Jean. - Where should we go? - Jean! Uh, well, we could... we could go to Nordstrom - or we could go to the movies. - Jean! - What? - Jean! - Come here. - Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, honey. Oh. Oh, boy. We got to get out of here, I can't be seen here. Oh, God, Jeanie, it's been awful. My car was taken. Sold for 100 dollars. 100 stinking dollars. That goddamn Spencer. He kicked me out of this place and put me in Verdugo Hills on a three-week vacation. Oh, it's just horrible. Well, why don't you come in for some lunch? I can't, Jean, I can't. Well, look, don't be silly, you can come in. I'm not allowed in that concentration camp. That Mormon booted me out! We just talked about this. Boo... kicked out? Why did that happen? Uh, that doesn't matter. I can't go in, and that's that. But listen, Jeanie, you don't have to stay in this place. I'm going to get you out of here. I've got this deal, I've been working on with an oil company in Jamaica. I don't understand. You don't have to understand. Understand this, my ship's come in. Soon we'll be making love on a bed of gold in the Hollywood Hills. Ho-ho, that sounds lovely. - Let's go. - Okay. Oh, uh, I am a mess. - I have to change. - No, no, no, no. No, we'll come back later and pick up your clothes. - But I have spots. - It's okay. I don't see why you need to bring her. She's part of the plan. She's coming, don't worry. It's been a half hour. She's slow to get ready. It's a thorn in my side, William, having to share you. Jeanie, Adina survived the holocaust, cancer, the loss of her husband. I can't just leave her, she needs me. We all need each other. You're a good man, William. Mm-mm, here she comes. Oh, something is different about you, Adina. I just came from the salon. Well, it looks very nice. My hair dresser is an artist. He trained with the Carita sisters, in the first district of Paris. Doesn't Adina's hair look nice, Jeanie? Oh, yes, it does. - Very nice. - Okay, let's go. How much this time? Just 200. Wire fee. Back in a jiffy. Adina, may I ask you something? Do you mind my being here? It's not my favorite thing in the world, but life is too short to make an issue of it. Besides... there are many different kinds of love. Okay, ladies, done deal. Just have to wait for confirmation. What do you say, we go celebrate? Okay, folks, is there going to be anything else? Yes, three slices of cherry pie, and three Pepsi's. We're celebrating. Oh, well, that's very nice. What's the occasion? Don't ask. My ship has just come in. Hmm. Well, okay, I'll be right back with you. I don't really like cherry pie. That's because you're ignorant. We're all born ignorant, and you have been ignorant for a long time. 81 years. And with me you will learn to walk upright with God. Soon, you will be out of that snake pit, and that garbage hole, and we will all be living together. Just have to wait for the call. Living together with a man and not even married. My mother would swoon. In heaven, there is no marriage. We have a heavenly relationship. We live above the law. Not outside the law, we are not outlaws. And I am going to keep you out of the mundane and the vulgar. Colentina, where's my... It is I! The capitano. ♪ He's the capitano who's the master of the sea, hey ♪ And we are Alfredo Comedia. Just marvelous. They're so talented. Yes, I love Comedia. The classics have actually been a big influence on my own work. You write? - Yes. - Oh. Poetry mostly. I've actually had a book published. No. May I read it some time? - I probably have a copy lying around somewhere. - Oh. Goddammit John Collins! The play was fabulous. You know, my mother used to play the piano for silent films. Sometimes she would take me with her. I loved it so much. I think that was when I knew I wanted to be an actress. But then I got married and that fell by the wayside. I was married for 57 years. Wow! - Arthur was my sweetheart. - Oh. - He was ambassador to Poland. - Really? Oh, we used to entertain all kinds of esteemed figures. He must have been an incredible man. Yes, he was. I loved him very much. Yes, I loved Richard very much. But you know, sometimes I wonder what I would have done if I hadn't been a wife and mother. I stopped acting very early. Yes, I've had a very rich life, but I do think there are some things missing. Like what? Oh, I can't express it. I'm trying to define it in my poetry. Those are really cool cars. Really like that blue one. I just love little people. I think if we had a child, he would be just like this boy. Of course, it's a little late now. Oh, I don't know. Abraham and Sarah were 90. Goddamn John Collins. Why don't you just call him? Oh, God, I can't call him. He can only call me. It's always 200 more dollars, 200 more dollars, 200 more dollars. And you women still stuck in those goddamn concentration camps! The Gramercy is a nice place. It's garbage! It's a garbage concentration camp run by a Mormon Nazi, and if you want to, you can just stay there and be garbage, too. It isn't garbage, William. It's a lovely place with lovely people. Many actors, retired from TV and movies, even Stella Adler... I'm sick of you, Jeanie! Women. Easily beguiled. I was only trying to tell you how I feel. All right. Oh, there, there, dear. Uh, he just gets excited. You mustn't let it hurt you. Why is he like that? It's always bad when John Collins calls. You need to learn when to be quiet, dear. Don't fret, Will, he'll call soon. I don't want to go upstairs. I don't know where else to take us. Couldn't we go do to Kavkaz? The Russian joint? It's probably closed at this hour. Ever since you moved, you spend all of your time with her. Incorrect. I've taken an egalitarian approach. I spend just as much time with you. Listen, don't worry about this setback. I'll take care of John next time he calls, and I'm going to get you out of this place in no time at all. You know I'll never leave you. Goodnight, William. Goddammit Richard Nixon. Hello? John? A... Adina? Oh, can I call you back? Now is not a good time. Oh, all right. You need a home, William. A real home. No, I don't. This deal will be done, probably before this meal is done. And John's going to call at any moment. I know, but it'll take at least a month to furnish an entire mansion. That's true. I never thought about that. And if you had a nice apartment, you wouldn't have to live in that filthy van. And, we'd have a place to make love. I can't afford an apartment, Adina. I haven't even made a payment on that stinking van in two weeks. I've taken care of it. - What do you mean? - I got you an apartment. I was going to tell you. I don't need you to take care of me, - I can take care of myself. - I know, I know! You can pay me back as soon as the Jamaica deal comes through. We could go tomorrow, William. And you can bring Jeanie. So yeah, like, I think $40 is completely reasonable for a smoothie of that caliber. That Bananarama one has got coconut milk. - Oh, yeah. - Coconut oil. Out of this world. - Hello. - Hi. - Classic. - Yeah. Oh, I told them to clear everything out. It's all right. This is nice! - Yeah. - Oh, William, I think we can make this real cozy. Don't you think? Hotter than a witch's tit. Well, it's been closed up. I'll open the window. Uh, good idea. Don't you like the color though. Yeah, I do, I kind of do. Not bad. Got a pillow. Oh, yeah. This is the life. - You like it? - I love it. I love it! Oh, hold on a minute. Hold on. - Who is it? - Who's there? We're here to drop off the mattress. Oh. Oh, shit. Uh... Hold on a second! Put your shirt on, Jeanie. Okay, boys, step right in. - This way around. - Where do you want it? Flop it over there in the corner, and that'll be great. What time is it? - It's about two. - Oh. I have to go feed Maxie, he'll be starving. Well, I'll go down there with you. Thank you, gents. Mm, my pleasure. Why don't you stay here, Jean, in case there's more deliveries? I'll pick up some food on my way back. Okay. Oh, shit. What the fuck do you call this? Jeanie, I got us dinner! Jeanie? Jeanie! Jeanie? What is it? What took you so long? I had to pick up some things. You... You left me here. I was coming right back. I, I didn't like being left alone, William. I didn't know where you were. I told you that I had to take Adina back to feed Maxie. And I brought us some dinner. Why can't we go downstairs for supper? Well, we're not at Gramercy, we're in my apartment. What? Come on, you'll feel better when we get some food into you. I'm very sorry I left you, okay? But everything's okay now. You'll be fine. - Come on, come on... - Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Now, are you crying, because you feel bad or do you feel bad, because your crying? - Huh? - I missed you. I missed you. Well, I missed you, too, but I'm back now, and we're going to have something to eat, and then we'll tuck you into bed. Everything is okay now. Oh, good morning, sweetheart. I got up to make you some breakfast, but guess what? There's no food in the house. We've got turkey dinners. Oh, we need more than turkey dinners. I'm going to go to the store, get us some groceries, and then I'm going to make us a nice house-warming dinner, and we can invite Adina. Don't worry about it, I'll pick up some food later. Oh, please. I want to make something. I want to make something special. Please, it'll make me happy. Okay. How are you feeling today? Good, oh, I'm sorry about yesterday. I don't, I don't know what came over me. Must have been the heat. Okay. Oh, need you to get a table and some chairs. Got to turn this place into a nice cozy home. Phew. I hope you came with an appetite. And... and what is it we're having? Beef stroganoff. I love beef stroganoff. I know. Looks delicious, Jean. Great. Bon Appetit. This is delicious. Oh, I'm so glad you like it. I used to cook for my boys all the time. They're all on the East Coast now, though. Do you have family? I do, my son David. Herr Komandant. I know that they have to have lives of their own, but it does get lonely sometimes not having family around. Having two lovely ladies to have dinner with is all I need. Oh, would you like some wine? Yes, please. Okay. What do we toast? To hearth and home, good friends, and best of all, fine wine. Hear, hear. It was beautiful, Adina. I can tell you are a poet. Which reminds me, you said you wanted to, uh, read some of my poetry. Oh, Adina! That's wonderful. Thank you! Oh, my! May I read something from it? Be my guest. "O, let not my day be frittered away on frivolous things. Timetables, dry and serious matters, all my orphan chores. Speak not to me of duty, nay, nor toil, nor that bitter-handed mistress propriety. I'll be in the garden walking with my friends amongst the blue-bottomed blooms while magpies giggle o'er our heads. Or sitting in the meadow on a picnic, eating brie and blueberries, laughing at a silly thing that someone said. And if the day is hot, we'll shuck our shirts, and swim in the clear running stream. Should pressing matters rise, should you have urgent need of me... write a little note and leave it by my door. Perhaps, I'll see it once the sun has set." - Oh. - Bravo. Bravo. Thank you. That was beautiful. These are your gorgeous words. Poetry usually scares me. But that, that was more like music than poetry.

There's enough room for the three of us. No, no, I should go. Maxie needs me. Okay, sweetheart. She's wonderful, William. Goodnight, my love. Oh, I forgot. Uh, I have a doctor's appointment in Westwood tomorrow. Could you take me? - Of course. - I hate going by myself. Of course, of course, my dear. Don't miss me too much. William. Hmm? Time for your surprise. What do you think? You look like a tramp in the whorehouse of France. What? - What do you... - You look like a harlot in a speakeasy. There are no harlots in this house. This is a house of God, not the whore house of France! Just because a lady puts on lingerie, it doesn't mean she... Take it off! And don't you ever wear it again in my house, do you hear me? You will be cast out like Cain into the wilderness! I didn't do it for you. I did it for me! You son of a bitch! Hello, this is William Selig. John! Jo... it's been weeks! What the fuck is going on over there? No, I sent the... It's quite frustrating. No, well, I haven't seen a dime of that, goddammit. Oh. Oh. Jeanie? Jeanie, good news! Jeanie? Oh, my God! Jeanie, what, what... What happened? What happened to you? - Huh? - How did this happen? Huh? Did you fall down? Got to get you... into your... We got to get you into bed and get you warmed up. My God, what's going on, huh? Let me get you under the covers. Snug as a bug in a rug. - Oh. Oh. - There you go. Now, I need to take Adina to her doctor's appointment now, and you just stay under the covers and try to warm up, okay, darling? Okay? I'll be back soon. Richard? No. It's me, William. Okay, darling? You stay there and I'll be back. As soon as I can, all right? I'll be back. It was just a misunderstanding. Um, I don't know, some kind of red tape with Jamaican customs. Uh, but it's all sorted out now, he just... He just needs the shipping fee again, because the last payment expired, see? So I told him we could go by this afternoon after your appointment, you know. Wooh! Such a relief. Not a moment too soon. Yeah, I'm, I'm getting a bit worried about Jean. She's not been herself. This thing must be busted. Let's go find the stairs. Oh, my knees are so tired and sore. I don't know what you want me to do. Come on, come on, we're going to be late! - I need a moment. - Well, we got to get moving. We need to get back to Hollywood to send that wire. I can't be part of this anymore. What? I can't give you any more money. What do you mean? Why? Why? My son looked through my statements and he saw the withdrawals. He's taken control of the accounts. What? But you're a part of the deal. How am I going to get you out of Argyle? I don't want to leave Argyle. You want to turn against me? Of course not! You don't want us to have our mansion where we can live together in peace and I can take care of you? It's not real. What are you saying? The mansion, John Collins, it's not real. Of course, it's real! I was just on the phone with him, - we're at the finish line. - It's not! It's another scam just like the one that lost you your printing business. Please William, dears, can't you see? It's never going to end. He's just going to keep asking you for money. They have turned you, Adina. They have gotten into your head and turned you against me. - I thought you loved me. - I do love you. - Then why are you doing this? Why? - William, William, no. Oh, hello, William. Didn't know where you'd gone, so I went out and went shopping, got some things for our place. Went to a department store and found curtains on sale. Two for one. Thought they'd go perfect on that window back there. William, what's wrong? What's wrong? Is it John Collins? Adina had an accident. What? What happened? She tripped, fell down some stairs. - It's terrible. - Oh, how awful! Those idiots... need to fix their elevators. Can you imagine? An 84-year-old woman, made to take the stairs. I'm taking those bastards to court. How bad is it? Is she okay? I don't know. Well, we're going to go see her. No, no, she needs to rest, she's been through enough. I don't care. She's all alone, William, and she needs us. I'm going to go see here. - Hello. - Hi. Uh, we're here for Adina Kirchuk. Yes, uh, IDs please. All right. Great. Uh, um, okay. So, you are allowed upstairs, Miss Chandler, but I'm sorry you're going to have to wait in the lobby, Mister Selig. - What do you mean? Why? - You're on our restricted list. What restricted list? What kind of bullshit is that? I'm sorry, it's just, It's just what's in the system. Well, that's nonsense. That's my Adina up there. - It, it's ok... - Goddammit. William, it's okay. Go sit down and I'll go see her. - I'll be right with you. - No, that's horseshit. Sit down. I can take care of it. Go on. Go on. Oh, my... You poor thing. How did you know I was here? Will brought me. - William? - Mm-hmm. Is he here? He's downstairs. They wouldn't allow him to come up here. Is, is there anything I can do for you? Could I have a sip of water? Sure. Here. You have the most beautiful blue eyes. Oh. Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you. I see why he loves you. He's a good man. Take care of his heart. - Who is this? - She's a friend of mine. Will brought me. - He's here? - Yes, he's downstairs. Unbelievable. I'll have security get him out of the building. David. But why? He's a friend of Adina's. William is no longer allowed to be around my mother. Please, will you step outside? - David! - Mom. Please. My mother is seriously injured. - William pushed her down the stairs. - What? He has a history of being violent and he's delusional. No, there has to be some mistake. - Will is a good man. - I don't know what to tell you. If you were my mother, I wouldn't let you near him. - You son of a bitch, where is she? - Security! Security! - Adina, where are you? - William, you stay out of there. - Get out of my way, you little shit. - You need to calm down. - Adina. - Oh, William, dearest, I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look at you. They wouldn't let me in to see you. - I'm sorry. - Get him the hell out of here. - Get him out of here. - Get him off me! It's over, William. I'm taking her back to Washington with me. You will never see her again. I'll kill all you Nazi bastards! I'm an heir to the Kingdom of the Son of God, and I will not be set aside! It's done, William, it's done! Jeanie. Jeanie. Hold on! Did you push Adina down those stairs? No, why would I push Adina? Her son said you did. Of course he's going to say that. He had me excommunicated! She missed a step and fell down the stairs. The goddamn elevator was broken! I'm tired, I'm going home. Jeanie! You can't go alone! Don't you follow me or I'll scream. Jeanie! - Excuse me, officer. - Yes, ma'am. Can you tell me how to get to First Avenue and A? What city is that? New York City, obviously. Do you know where you are, ma'am? Manhattan. Do you have any ID? Oh, I must have left it at home. Okay. - You want to... you want to come with me then? - Yes. Alright, we'll help you out. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, Mister Williams, nice to see you. Give me a crumb donut in a bag, please. Where is your wife and sister today? Actually, I'll take a dozen, just give me a dozen. Oh, going big today, huh? Put me through to Jeanie Chandler. Put me through to her, you beetle boy shithead! You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Hey, William, how is it going, brother? William! Hey! William, you can't be here, man, you know that. Hey, you can't be here, come on. Come on, man, don't make me call the fucking cops. I got so many important things to be doing right now. Please, let's go. Now, come on. - Enough, we're going. Spence! - Get off of me, beetle! Spence, can you help me? Oh, my God! William! Hey! William! - William, what are you doing here? - Come on, Jeanie. - We got to go, come on. Come on. - Where are we going? - Put some clothes on, come on. - Where are you taking me? Come on. I'm taking you out of here, for good. But this is my home. We don't have time for this, Jeanie. - Let's go! - No, I'm not going! Goddammit, Jeanie, it's not safe here! You live among Nazis. I am going to take care of you. - Take care of me? - Yes! You can't take care of yourself. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Well, where are you going to take care of me? In an apartment that you can't afford? Or a mansion in the hills? William, it's, it's not real. It's a beautiful dream, but it's not real! You, too, huh? Goddamn, they turned you against me, too! Yes, yes, yes. - Look what you did! - I know you're in there, Will. - Come on now, man. - See what you did? You have crossed the line. - Where are my keys? Go get my keys. - They're trying to take you away from me. I'm just trying to save you! - Stop it! - You are bumped! Why did you do this? Why? I, I love you! - Are you going to push me down the stairs? - What? She loved you. - How could you, Will? - I did not do it! - How could you? - It was an accident! - How could you? - She slipped. - How could you? - I didn't do it. - How could you? - I told you I didn't do it. Goddammit, Will! Go to hell, you son of a bitch! I'll just take care of you later! The cops are on their way right now, Will! I'll kill you, you Mormon asshole son of a bitch. William, Jean! - Come on. - But we can't leave the children, Richard. What? Jeanie, it's me, William. The children are asleep. And we can't leave them. They're sleeping. We can't wake them up. Make them stop the noise. Make them stop. They'll wake the children. They'll wake the children. Don't, stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! They will wake the children. This is William Selig. I made a mistake. You always offered to help me out. $2,500. I, uh... they suspended my social security. Well, I'm not sure. Uh, I just... I just need some help, Sammy. What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Oh, this is bullshit. Look at these fuckers. What? What do you mean eviction notice? Goddammit, let me in! This is my apartment! Let me in! Hello? Hello, William. Hello, John. I apologize for our prior difficulties... but we've just about got things worked out. If you act now, I can guarantee you a mansion with a pool and a landing strip, with a Mercedes, and a chauffeur. Really? A chauffeur? Well, now, that sounds pretty good. We need a man like you, William Selig. There is just a small matter of a property tax which remains unpaid. Until that is covered, we cannot release the property. The amount of this tax is $400. I don't have any money, it's all gone now, John. Please, try to focus, William. You must remain focused on what is important. We need each other. You deserve the American dream, William...
