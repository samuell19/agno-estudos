Are you single forever? Here we are again tonight with another Prime exclusive, "Are you single forever?" This program confronts today's troubled women with the harsh realities of the world, and is, well, a kind of educational program. Today we welcome author Mami Honda as a commentator. Thank you for having me. We're glad you're here. Speaking of you, it's yours, isn't it? The book was a smash hit 10 years ago. It's "Let's be a blooming flower alone in the savanna called the city", how nostalgic is "CitySavanna". Wait, that was ten years ago? I can't believe it, only in Heisei era here. But back then, everyone was reading CitySavanna. Those were the days! Are you guys watching? It's been ten years already. Time really flies by. Right? That means... Come here. Uh, our theme this time is "Sugar Daddy" girls. Our guest girl, come on to the stage! Hello! [ Sugar Daddy Girl Ms. M ] Well, umm...This old man doesn't really get it. but what does "sugar daddy" really is? Well, to put it simply, I get paid 30,000 yen an hour by making it lively while drinking. What? That much? Wait a minute, in two hours you can buy a Roomba! That's why I think my life is so easy. Well, let me ask you a juicy question, but is it really only drinking? There's more to it, like, you know... Ah, you mean my body? I don't know about those bottom-feeding girls, but I don't do that. I mean, just to be able to have a drink with a pretty, young girl like me is priceless, don't you think? Wow... What a scary woman! No, aside from boys, isn't it lonely for a girl living all alone? Girls are like bunnies. Well, if he's... cute and he loves me, maybe I can make it work. There it is! "Loves me"! Ms. Honda wrote about that in her book. "A woman being loved? What is it?" "We weren't born to do such things." She wrote it saying, "Please give this little girl a good talking to". Well... she does have a point. What? At my age, I think it's hard to live alone all the time. Huh? Wait, wait, hold on... um... What you said completely contradicts your book. Because isn't it so? I'm not afraid of dying alone. What I fear most at this point is living alone forever. No, I can't imagine being alone all the time. I want a sugar daddy too... Kidding... Oh, my! Ms. Honda is looking for a sugar daddy! What the hell is she saying? Mami Honda, you became empty The loneliest women are not those who are alone, but those who can't stand to be "alone" and quickly get attached with someone. Honey. Haruto won't sleep at all. Just cuddle him and he'll fall asleep. That's impossible, I'm not you. Oh, I have to email them back. Look, he's crying. Miho, I'm so glad you're here. Oh, really? You played your role perfectly. So happy to hear that! I like smart girls. Then I'll invite my friends over next time and let's have a drink. - Let's! Please invite Ms. Tokunaga, too. Ah... He leaves right after filming. - Huh... Please. - Even if you say please... Mami, good work. Rei, thank you. Wow, you gave me a shock. Huh? That Mami said she couldn't live all alone. Maybe I shouldn't have done that. No, the opposite. I'm glad. You know, people say it's hard being alone. Right. You think so too, Ms. Goshogawa? Of course I do! At your funeral, you know, "She's been single all her life..." Imagine being told that, sometimes it gives me shivers. That's not good. Anyway, I'm glad that we cast Mami. - I might ask you to do it every other week. - Are you sure? Ms. Gosho and Ms. Honda, how do you know each other? Ah, Mami is my junior in college. When she said she was gonna drop out and be a writer, I wasn't so sure. But then, "CitySavanna" really sold well, didn't it? You bought a condo in Sangenjaya, right? For real? Wow... No, it's old. Mami, do you have a boyfriend? Ah, yes. Sort of. Are you thinking of marrying him? Well, he's younger than me, so I haven't really... Because, you said you can't live all alone, right? I guess it's true that if a woman buys a condo, she'll stay away from marriage. Watch out. Next time, it'll be a dog. You're talking about you, isn't it? That's right! I can't live without him... Wanna see? I've seen it 100 times. Here it is! Cute, isn't it? I think this dog's the best in the world. My Kota, I hope he's okay. I miss him already. Hello? Mami, how are you? I'm fine. Did something happen? No, it was your birthday, remember? Huh? Oh... it's true. You must be 36 already. Is that why you called? There was an earthquake there last night, wasn't there? You're alone and probably helpless. Your mother feels sad for you. You feel sad for me... I saw it. The live stream and what you said. It's a relief to know that you wanted to get married, too. That book made me a little embarrassed, you know. So, you got someone? Sorry. I'm getting ready to leave. - Hey... - Bye. Clothes, shoes, and bags, I can get myself whatever I want, and yet... Is it "sad" to bloom alone? [ The loneliest women are those who can't stand being alone and jump at the honey that is called "marriage" ] Sure, those words were written by a 26 year old me. But... [ Will I Be Single Forever? ] [ English subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] [ SnowRabbit: Mami Honda, you became empty ] [ SnowRabbit: The loneliest women are not those who are alone, but those who can't stand to be "alone" and quickly get attached with someone ] Putting on makeup is pointless. If I were a man, I could sleep another half hour longer. It's growing. In other words, a woman like Mami Honda. [ In other words, a woman like Mami Honda ] So much free time, huh? Goddamn it... Rika? Okay. Yeah, I got it. I got it. Oh, for real? Wow, that's so nice of you! Thank you! Yes, yes, yes. Since yesterday, it's been on LINE. Somehow it was on Yahoo! News... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the director took a liking and asked for a drink next time. They said they'd bring in some entertainers, but those guys are really stingy paying the check. What? Really? Isn't that amazing? Oh, clubbing? You bet. Well, if there are any model girls, get them and we can sell them when we can. I'm okay with a 6:4 split. Okay... Let's process that... #Jillstuart. #SugarDaddy. #AGiftFromMySugarDaddy. #GirlWantstoSparkleDMme. Cute. [ Recommended for Moms! 5 Time-saving Beauty Products ] This old lady's all worked up. It's such a pain in the ass. Honey, it looks like Haruto pooped. Okay. After you change his diaper, I thought we should hit the park. I figured we should leave you with the housework, right? Huh? Nothing, thank you. Okay, here. Take care of it. Just playing with the kid is not babysitting. Shall we change it? Ms. Honda, it's been a long time. It's been a while. I saw that program. It was trending. Well, some opinions are like this. "In other words, a woman like Mami Honda." Wow... this person was a "CitySavanna" fanatic, right? Don't worry about it. People tend to change after 10 years. Right. So... how is the next draft coming along? What do you think about "way of living" as a theme? Way of living? You know, "careful living" is all the rage. Some... Something simple, not flashy. Is it something like this? This "HaruMama" is amazing. With a simple text and a fashionable photo, she has 230,000 followers. 230,000... Mr. Shinkawa, I see you got married. Yes, three years ago. Congratulations. Ah, no... I'm kind of embarrassed. But marriage is so much better than I thought it would be. I feel like I now have an absolute ally. An... ally? Yes. Okay, for instance, how about if you aim to get married? Like meeting a lot of men at a matchmaking party. And then write down what you felt and illustrate it. Easy-to-read, real-life essay. I think the readers of "CitySavanna" are older now, and I want you to give them a new perspective they can relate to. I guess you don't want that. No... I'll think about it. Thank you. Hello, Kohei? Yeah, I'm in Omotesando right now. Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm on my way then. Bye. I'm coming in... Sorry, Mami. I had to reschedule. No, it's totally fine. Is it work? It's not work, it's something important. Something like that. Have a seat. He bought another pair. Hey, Mami. Look, look. What? Did you take this? Nice, isn't it? Yeah... You were interested in photography? No, just lately. Lately. My friend said he's going to put it up at his store. Wow, that's amazing! Right? What? Hey... Are you Mami Honda? Please turn this way. - Please, over here. - Stop... So beautiful... I love your smiling face the most. Right, Smiling Mami. Next, stand right over there. What... I'm starving. Can I make you something? I was thinking I'd cook today. Let me help you. It's okay. Just wait there. Thanks. That's enough. God... I'm so hungry... It's been 3 hours. It's done. Curry? Yeah, I made the spices myself. That's why it took three hours... I knew that making the spices gives off a different aroma. Right? Hey, you know the 3Cs? The 3C? I've only heard of the 3B. Beautician, band member, and bartender. I was told so many times not to date men like me. But now it's the 3C. Cameraman, creator, and... What's the other one? Curry making spice guy. Wow, Good one. They will never be happy. How is it? Yeah... it's delicious. Are you not gonna eat, Kohei? Somehow, watching you eat was enough for me. What? You should eat. I'm good. Just eat. You eat it. Shall we get married? What? Oh... I said it. Married? Yes. I think it would be super fun to get married and have kids with you. Kids? Oh, no... I said it. What do you think? Yeah... I'm happy. Really? Yes... Thank you, Kohei. Cheers for love tonight! This is the best! Are you drinking? Ah... Yes. Are you an idol? Yes. Have some more fun. It's a festival. Festival? Because you get paid for making the drinking more fun. It's the best, don't you think? I'm sorry. I'm not much of a drinker. Goodbye. What? Because this is a guarantee drinking. Do you know it? That's your job. I mean, you can't make it in Roppongi just by being cute. Why not just go back to your hometown and get married? Then why don't you go live a boring life. You seriously suck. Scary... Minato Ward Girl. Obsessed with Roppongi!!! Let's go clubbing! - Ms. Miho. - Wanna go? Here. Thank you. Here. Wait, wait. Because the cute girl left. Huh? It's a guarantee drinking, it's your job, and next time bring a younger girl. Good work. There. There. Hey, hey. Look at this. My junior recently took up photography, but he just takes pictures of the sky that look all the same. That's true. Maybe I'll give him a compliment. He said he was going to propose, maybe that's his girlfriend's thing. Really? You know, Honey. Haruto won't go to sleep unless I cuddle him. Isn't it because you're in the habit of cuddling him? You should do that. Sleep training? I saw something like that. Huh? Hey, can I ask you something? Can I go to my college reunion? This Sunday, and, uh... it's just lunch. Sunday? I haven't seen everyone for a long time. Okay. What? I'll take care of Haruto. Go and have fun. Thank you. What? Marriage? Yes. What...!　Isn't this a bit sudden? I know, right? Wow... Hey, hey, what does he do for a living? He's in a trading company. A trading company employee. That's pretty secure. Okay! Let's make the announcement. Put this on. You wear white, and we'll take a picture together, and announce it on our show's Instagram. Maybe some online news outlet will pick it up. Good publicity for the show. No, wait... I mean, the Mami Honda of "CitySavanna" is getting married. It's a revolution. It's gonna make headlines. Mami, congratulations. Oh, that... The Housewives'... "Careful Living" magazine. - "Living handbook"? - Not that. - "Orange Page"? - Yes, that! Next time, maybe you'll be in the "Orange Page". Rei, you're getting ahead of yourself. Not fast enough. Maybe a dress would be nice. I'm not wearing it. What's with these pictures? Apparently, the manager's friend took this. Sky shots are so amateurish. I know. It doesn't go well with the cafe's style, right? Seriously, you're right. Right? Miss, you're so stylish. Do you know anyone here? Huh? I've seen this woman before. You know her? No, no. What? What was it? What was it... I remember now. The book author, Mami Honda. That author, Mami Honda? In college, my girlfriend was reading... something called "A Blooming flower in the Amazon?" with a long ass title like that. Wow... Impressive! I haven't seen a celebrity since Dave Spector. I met him too the other day. I haven't seen one since then. Hey, hey, what are you guys getting her mixed into? Are you okay? Huh? What's your relationship with her? Engaged... sort of? Marriage? - Nice catch, Kohei! - Seriously? You guys are too excited. What's the age gap then? Mami, how old are you? Thirty... six... We're five years apart. What?! Seriously, Kohei. Respect, my man. She must be really rich. No, age has nothing to do with it. Besides, Mami doesn't look 36. Indeed, she's beautiful and famous. From now on, she won't be Mami Honda, but Mami Hashida. That only changes two characters. You're right. Once we're married, you can continue to work as "Mami Honda". Huh... Ms. Mami, I'm glad that Kohei is so understanding. Kohei, been a while since you last did a spin? I like the sound of that. Let's do it. Kohei is such a nice guy, huh? Come on, let's go. Everyone, Kohei will spin the table. Gather around. Gather around. By the way, everyone, this man is getting married. Clap your hands! Here you go. Thanks. How was it? Hmmm... it's good. I knew it. Yeah... I should've gone with the beans. This is from Peru. It's more bitter than acidic, with a slightly sweet aftertaste. Yeah... you're right. Right? Oh, I see. Right. I have to go home for the weekend. The memorial service, right? Yeah. My grandma's. I'll go with you on that one. And I have to greet your parents. Right? Yes. Hey, listen. Yes. About kids. Oh, yeah. Do you know what a bridal check is? Uh, I've heard about it. I think we should take the test if we want to have children. Know if there are any diseases that need treating, and if anything should happen, find a way to deal with it. Yeah, I think that's good. Right. I'll set up a reservation so we can go together. What? I need to be there too? Even though I'm a man? No... it's kinda scary. Can't you just go? But... Please. Okay. Then I'll just make a reservation for now. Yeah. Good luck. Because it's you, I know it will be all right. You come here hoping for something, only to be disappointed when there's nothing. That's what reunions are like. With all the fancy looking, cold food. Yukino. Wow, long time no see. It's been a while. We thought you might not come because you've been busy. Huh... Of course I'm coming. Okay, okay, don't cry. I'm sorry. My husband was supposed to watch him, but he had to go to work. Totally fine. He's so cute. I miss it. My kid is all grown up. But when he starts talking, will he still be cute? Well, yeah, I guess so. Hey, are you following Ayaka's Instagram? I don't follow her, but I checked it. It's really popular. Wow, something like that makes me tense. Why? I bet that "Sparkling Housewife" with an Instagram is sexless anyway. Hey. It's been a while. Ah, it's been a long time. We were just talking about you. We said your Instagram is amazing. It's just a hobby, though. Wow, a hobby like that? Wow... Your baby is so cute. When he's quiet, he's an angel. That's a long way off for me... But on your Facebook page, you went to a hot spring with someone, right? Oh, that? We broke up. Since when? At the beginning of this year. No way. Didn't you said you were moving in together? It was after we decided on the apartment. So where do you live now? That apartment. Alone? Isn't it a bit lonely? I might not be able to. Sorry. I didn't mean to. No, no, not at all. He seemed like a nice guy. Yes, he was. What!? You live where you were going to live together? Yeah, and that apartment wasn't to blame. Why did he break up with you? I don't know... Well, I bet you'd like to meet him, huh? Not really. - You want to see him. - No! That's why we have a special guest with us today. [ Special Guest Mr. Takeru ] Yuki, long time no see. Takeru... Go on, if you have something to say, might as well say it. How does it feel to dump an older girlfriend you've dated for 3 years and were supposed to move in with? It's... I even thought about marrying you. Because I thought you would be able to live on your own. No, I don't. You had a book about that too. Here. Yes, I do... But! I was always the one calling you, and you seemed fine without me. That's not true. Bye. Wait a minute. Sure, I can live on my own, but I don't want to change, I don't wanna be alone, that's why I want to be with someone, that's what marriage is for, right? So I got us a queen-size bed. It's so big, I can hardly relax. Do you know how I feel when I'm curled up in bed all by myself? Public services don't support unmarried people with no children. I'm really worried about growing old. Let's all live together. What? When we get old, let's all live together. Because dying alone is scary. True. We have to help each other to survive. A mutual aid. Mutual aid. Mutual aid! - How about it? - I like that. [ Mami Honda of "CitySavanna" is engaged! Her partner is a non-celebrity handsome young man ] Engaged? What? Is she gonna be a celeb-mom next? Yukino. It's been a long time. What, like 10 years? Ryotaro? I've missed you. HE'S HERE....!!!!! Reunion Specialty: An ex-boyfriend from college!!!!! How did you get here today? By bullet train. Nozomi? Yes. It didn't take long for you at all. - Better from what I've heard. - Slept the whole time. Mr. Kohei, thank you for coming all this way. You must be tired. No, I'm sorry my greeting took this long. Oh, it's okay. Don't worry about it. Congratulations, Mami! You found yourself a good man. Thanks. We were so worried. We heard you were doing weird jobs in Tokyo. A writer... I wonder if it's okay. So, when's the wedding? I'm thinking by the end of this year. Really? Hey! With Mami's age, the sooner the wedding and the baby, the better. That's true. Mami! Uncle Shiro? You just got here? Huh? Is the memorial over? Of course it is. I miss this place. I was walking and it just... started to rain. So free as ever. Thanks. Shiro? You're finally here? Wow, you guys are all here together. He's still the rain man. Mrs. Kyoko, can I get a beer? Okay... It's okay. Go sit down. Mami, just stay here. A weight has finally been lifted off me. She's an only daughter, right? Thank you, Kohei. No, no need. Honey, you're drinking too much. Because I wondered when will she get married... What did you like about Mami? Hey... A lot, actually. She's cute, beautiful, honest, and always smiling. What about you? Why did you decide to marry Mr. Kohei? Because he's kind. The best men are those who are kind. I'm sure you get told all kinds of things at work, too. Well, I suppose so. Men are like that. I'm really glad I met Mami. Let's drink. I'll take you up for it. Mami. You really drink a lot. He can really hold a drink. Drink up! It's been a long time since we've been here. The menu has changed. Huh? The stewed hamburger steak that you like is not here. Whoa. I could taste it in my mouth. I get it. Huh? I never thought I'd get to see you again. Me too. I'm so glad. Are you still with that company? I changed jobs. You changed jobs? The first company I joined, it was too exploitative. Yes, it was. I thought so. Because of that, it hit you too. Right now, I'm in a relatively laid-back work environment, and I get to do what I want. This taste never changes. Delicious! Was the pepper this harsh? Really? Yeah. Oh, you're still doing that. You always avoid things you don't like. That hasn't changed. Oh, no, I'm just a little allergic to nuts. You're as fussy as ever, . In a weird way. Now, I remember. This guy... The movie's killer was obvious, wasn't he? Oh, is that so? What? You didn't get it!? You're so slow-witted. Every word he chose was negative, full of spite. How nostalgic. Right. Most memories are beautifully fabricated. But there was a reason we broke up. The loneliest women are not those who are alone, but those who can't stand to be "alone" and quickly get attached with someone. What? I was disappointed not because of my ex-boyfriend, I sealed those memories away, because I was so afraid of being alone. Now if you'll excuse me. Thank you for the food. It's so delicious. The steak here is by far the best. Yes. I have a restaurant I want to go to next time! It would be fun to go there together. Miho. Why're you giving it now? Isn't it more than usual? You need money, right? Did I say that? I know, it's the same bag as the last time. Mr. Masuda, you're so sweet. So, I want to end our relationship now. Huh? Either we become sexual lovers or we never see each other again. Lovers... Miho. I'm serious. You're married. I see. Stop it. We don't have to do that. We've had a great time so far. I don't sell my body. So what else can you sell? Miho, how old are you now? You don't have to say that. Wait. I've already paid you. No, you didn't. One million yen for the severance! I'll send you the transfer details on LINE. If you run away, I will kill you! Are you single forever? I've been playing and drinking since I was 20, and before I knew it I'm 26. What? No certifications? What about getting a job? Savings? I don't have all three. Oh, I have a certificate. My license! No, no. But, you know, so far I've been able to get by on my own, and made more money than the average person on a regular job. Huh? You are not an average person. I thought if push came to shove, I could just marry someone with money. Life isn't that easy. Then how am I supposed to live from now on? You got what you deserved. Huh? Who would marry a woman like you? A sugar-daddy, guarantee drinker. You talk about it so casually, but what you're doing is just selling yourself out. You're the "Anpanman of the night." [ Transfer (Yoshinari Masuda) ] Now I can pay rent for a while. Miho, don't be one of those women who spend 50 yen a chapter on Mecha Comics. Has he fallen asleep? He's got the futon up. My Mami's getting married, huh? Are you relieved? No. What is it? But... you don't have to force yourself to get married.. I'm not forcing myself. You've been pushing me all this time, and now that I've found one, you say no. That's strange. I didn't say no. You did. You shut up so easily. Okay? I've already decided to get married, so that's what I'll do! You... Can you talk to Mr. Kohei like you're mad at me right now? Do you really love him? Mami. Marriage is not always a good thing. Why are you telling me this now? I don't mind if you get married on a whim. But... even if you get married, you have to be ready to live alone. What are you two talking about? Water. Yes. Here you go. Mami. I'm really happy for you. I'm happy. I'm happy. Come on, let's go to bed. Yes, honey. There's nothing good about being at your husband's beck and call. Don't be like your Mom, Mami. Are you having trouble? What? Ah... Yeah. Roast pork cutlet and fried horse mackerel. Why are there two kinds of fried food? Right. I don't like to eat heavy food during the show. What? It makes me even more depressed. Do you check social media after the broadcast? Well... yeah. People don't care if you're married or not. Well, let's just do our best. Because in this day and age, there are many ways to live a life. There's no right answer. Married, single, being a woman, being a man, these categorizations are old-fashioned, right? Yes, I do everything at home. I cook and all. What? Me, an Ikumen? No. Because I'm her father. Tokunaga says his job is to fulfill his roles in this made-up world. That's what a pro does. It's kind of draining. We're not machines. That's why I always keep this conviction in my heart to protect myself. I'll do whatever it takes to stay alive. That's impossible! You're over 25 and have never been in love! And you live with your parents, right? What will you do if you never fall in love and your parents die? Don't be like your Mom, Mami. What do you think, Ms. Honda? Ms. Honda? Yes... right. I think one should be loved by someone at least once in their life. Would you like me to teach you how to be loved? As expected from the newly engaged woman! Ms. Honda is already engaged. No more dying alone. We'll talk more about how to make people love you later, but... Dying alone, huh... I'm really glad I have a family. Having a family is a good thing, isn't it? I knew you would be relieved. You are married, aren't you, Mr. Tokunaga? Yes, I'm already married. Family is great. When you catch a cold, I think it's nice to have family. I know, you really do feel alone when you're sick, right? Just moving your body is too hard. [ Ayaka: Yukino, I want to see you ] Huh!? [ 10 million unaccounted for state money ] [ Secretary General Love Embezzlemnt activities ] [ Severance pay for a Sugar Daddy Girl? ] I think I'm gonna die. Oh, I'm so pissed off... so pissed off! You're not gonna die. So shut the fuck up! I'm getting androgen. I want to go to a beauty salon. Oh, no. Dark circles. I wanna cover up my whole face...! Mami. - Kohei. - Sorry for the wait. What? You nervous? It's gonna be okay. Welcome. - I'm Hashida, we had a reservation. - Mr. Hashida? Let me show you the way. Your vibe is a little off. Really? Is it weird? You look old in that? You usually looked much prettier. I'm glad that you're a good person, Ms. Mami. Yes. You're a good girl. I also read your articles online. On Yahoo! News. Sorry it took me so long to say my greetings. No, no, I don't blame you. You're a very busy woman. Thank you. So, Ms. Mami. Are you going to quit your job? You mean the streaming program? I'm just there because of a friend of mine. Not that. You know, that... What was it? Not a novelist... I want... to continue being a writer. Mami's book sold very well even though it was a while ago. Yes, I've read it. Thank you. It was written by a young person, so it was difficult for me. I'm sorry. Even if one book was published, that's great, isn't it? It's not like you're an office worker. You're flexible in a lot of ways. Because it would be hard if you have kids. Well, I'm sure she'll quit eventually. What? Is that so? That's great. Please do so, Ms. Mami. For Kohei's sake. Dad, how are things at the office? It's going great. Do you go there yourself? Of course, I go there every day. I didn't think you still work that hard. Of course, I am! You know, he's taking me to Spain next. Ms. Suzuki? I heard that you can suppress that article by force. Yeah, maybe I can. Please, the money is... It's for that, right? I bet you got a lot of money out of it, too. Also, I think we both know. What do you wanna do? Sorry, we're not at a store. It's okay. I have to get some sun once in a while or I'll dry out. It's a nuisance when the baby starts crying. Do you care about that stuff? Yes, I do. You know how on Instagram you're always out to some trendy restaurant for a Mom's night out? Sorry, I was being sarcastic. I figured. You know, I thought I'd be happy once I was married. But I wasn't. Once married, children are next. And when you have kids... it's always a race to see which school you can get them into. I should've never quit my job. Are you suffocating? No matter how unhappy I am, I can't go anywhere if I leave my own life entirely to my husband. Say, Yukino. Yes? That Mutual Aid for old age. Count me in. What are you saying? Did you know? Most of those who die alone are married. It's okay. It's just sex. Just be patient and it'll be over. Think of all the glittery things. Have some more fun. It's a festival. That's why I think my life is so easy. Then why don't you go live a boring life. Stop! Fuck! Hey, you! Shut the fuck up, you idiot! Die! I thought that loneliness would disappear after marriage! I want to die! In this glittering city, I thought I was better than all the other girls. So I hang on to it no matter what... Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck! I'm glad our mothers were happy about it. Hey, Kohei. I'm not gonna quit my job. Oh, you mean from earlier? I didn't like that very much. Stop it. What's wrong? Come on, be the smiling Mami you always are. I mean, we'll talk about it sooner or later. You mean I have to quit sooner or later? I mean, you don't have to worry about it so much. Anyway, I'm thinking of buying a car. Why? "Why?"... we'll need it when we have kids. I don't even know if I can do it. What? I know you can. I don't want to drive because I crashed my car the day I got my license. Then we'll have to practice. In Tokyo, there are many narrow streets and one-way traffic, so it's not convenient. But you have to drive. Is that... an order? Huh? Because...You have to be able to drive. Isn't that right? Listen... We dated, we got married, and then we had kids. Surrounded with grandchildren when I'm old, I'll die happy. Yes, this is the right path. Did I say something wrong? You didn't. Then why do you look so scary? Where's the smiling Mami? I love your smiling face the most. Smile. I'm not smiling. I said smile! I don't want to smile! Kohei... Let's not get married. No, we can't do that. I've already told my company and my friends. I don't want to get married! Huh? Then why did you accept my proposal? I was just... under a spell. Ms. Mami Honda is here! Thank you. ...Are you okay? Yes. Okay, let's begin. Yes! And... we're live! Are you single forever? Here we are again tonight with another Prime exclusive, "Are you single forever?" This program confronts today's troubled women with the harsh realities of the world, and is, well, a kind of educational program. Today, let's continue the excitement with the book "Let's be a blooming flower alone in the savanna called the city" by Ms. Mami Honda, a writer who is a big hit! I am Mami Honda. Pleased to meet you. From engagement to marriage, Ms. Honda, you are on the fast track to happiness, once again, congratulations! We'd like to cut through even more of the worries of modern women than usual! About that... we broke it off. It's a live stream. I'm not sad or anything. Right now... I think I'm angry. Hey, this is bad. This is bad. No, don't stop it. Let her go on. If you're not married, you're seen as lacking in character, and they tend to make fun of a job they don't know anything about. Is it normal for us to change our last name? Is it normal for us to have kids? You met someone you haven't seen in a while, "Are you married?" They ask about your private life. When you told your hobbies, they would say, "You can't get married because you're doing that." Look at the clothes you wear, the house you live in, your obsession with makeup. That's what keeps people from getting married. Thanks for the advice. They feel sorry for you being alone... Thank you. But... shut the fuck up. That's what I think about most! Hello, Ayaka? I'm going to move out. Yeah, I think that's great. Yusuke. Yes? I want to work too. Bye-bye! Mami! What? What are you doing here? Uncle, you too! I'm not doing anything. You startled me. How's married life? I stopped it. The marriage. You're not surprised? I thought it might happen. What the hell... If marriage was supposed to make everyone happy, then I'd say that's too bad. You're so cool, Uncle Shiro. What's that, all of a sudden? You've always been cool. Always dressed the way you like, doing the things you like. I don't really know what I'm doing. I just an old man. You do what you want to do, no matter what anyone says. You keep fighting. That's what you are doing. What? You keep fighting. Walking on your own two feet, going to bed, waking up, and working every day, it seems obvious, but it's a wonderful and great thing to do. You're living strong in the savanna that is Tokyo. Savanna. Take Haruto, please. Here's the elephant. I'll pick it up. I'm sorry. - Here you go. - Sorry. - Thank you. Let me help you. Thank you. Roppongi, please. If you don't know, put it in your navigation system. No, I'll take you there. I know a lot about Roppongi. [ Driver's name: Miho Suzuki ] Hello. What? H--Hey... You're Mami Honda, right? I am. I'm a fan of "CitySavanna". Thank you. But... I hated you on that show. I was shocked that you changed and became an empty woman. And posting terrible things on the internet. But... you looked really cool the other day. Um... I'm really sorry. It's unforgivable. But... I think I am the one who was really mad at myself. I was afraid of being alone, of being loved, of being swept along with the flow of life. Are you happy now? I am... happy. Miss, what should we do about the bed? Throw it away! [ Let's be a blooming flower alone in the savanna called the city ] Whether I live with someone else from now on, or live alone forever, I will be strong. Hello, Mom? Yes, I'm okay. What's wrong? What? Are you crying? What's wrong? What? Yes. Yes. Oh no... I'm starting to cry too. Yes. Thank you. [ Zutto Dokushin de Iru Tsumori ] [ English subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] [ QC: rjgman56 ]
