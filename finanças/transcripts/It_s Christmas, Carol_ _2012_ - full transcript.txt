GET ME KENDRA. [♪♪] NO, I DON'T NEED TO CHECK WITH CAROL ON THIS, ED. I'M THE SENIOR EDITOR, SECOND IN COMMAND AT SPRINGWOOD, AND THIS IS MY CALL, SO YOU'D BETTER START LISTENING. [WHISPERS] CAROL'S ON THE PHONE FOR YOU. THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER, ED. LET ME KNOW. [CLICK] THIS IS KENDRA. IT'S ME. CAROL? WHERE ARE YOU? WAIT, ARE YOU ON FOOT? TRAFFIC WAS AWFUL, AND SITTING IN THE CAR SERVICE WAS JUST EATING THE DAY AWAY. I HATE THE HOLIDAYS. ARE YOU OKAY? I KNOW HOW TO WALK, KENDRA. LISTEN, MY CALL TO BERLIN FELL THROUGH. I WANT TO PUSH THE 11:00 MEETING UP. UH... SURE. WHAT TIME WERE YOU THINKING? NOW. HAVE EVERYONE READY. [DIAL TONE HUMS] OKAY, UH... FOLKS, MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? QUICKLY, EVERYONE, STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IT'S IMPORTANT. OKAY, PEOPLE, TWO QUICK THINGS. ONE, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO REQUESTED CHRISTMAS OFF TOMORROW... CAROL HAS DENIED YOUR REQUESTS. AND TWO, THE 11:00 MEETING HAS BEEN PUSHED UP. DON'T WORRY, WE'LL BE READY! IT'S NOW. OH, GOD HELP US. [GROUP PROTESTING, PANICKING] OKAY, GREAT. [AGITATED MURMURING] WHICH OF THESE SUBTITLES SHOULD WE GO WITH? "LOSE WEIGHT FASTER" OR "GET SLIMMER QUICKER?" OH, THEY'RE BOTH BAD. - THEY ARE? - YEAH. OH, GOD, CAROL WANTS A NEW SUBTITLE. WHAT SHOULD I DO? UH... IMPROVISE. IMPROVISE... OH, KENDRA. - DO YOU HAVE JUST-- - NO, TANYA. - I REALLY WOULD JUST-- - NO, TANYA. OH, OKAY, THANK YOU. SHH. QUIET! SHE'S COMING. [HIGH-HEELED FOOTSTEPS MARCHING CLOSER] [GASPING IN FRIGHT] LOOK ALIVE, PEOPLE. COME ON, GO, GO, GO, GO! OH, YOUR HAIR... LET'S GO. OKAY. BREATHE, BREATHE. LET'S GO. GOOD MORNING, MS. HUFFLER. WE'LL SEE. UM, OKAY, UM... CHRISTMAS NUMBERS ARE GOOD, BUT MAINLY DUE TO A SURGE IN ONLINE SHOPPING. AND WHAT ABOUT RETAIL? THE BIG THREE AREN'T MOVING AS MANY VOLUMES AS WE HAD HOPED. TELL THEM IF WE DON'T GET BETTER PLACEMENT, WE'LL PULL OUR STOCK. [CHUCKLES IN DISBELIEF] UH, REALLY? [CHUCKLES MOCKINGLY] YES. NEXT. UM, THE PRINCESS DOESN'T LIKE HER NEW GHOST WRITER. PRINCESS POP OR PRINCESS ROYALTY? PRINCESS ROYALTY. WELL, THEN, GET HER A NEW WRITER. BUT THIS IS THE FOURTH ONE. THEN FIND HER A FIFTH. FRED, LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE "THE 59-SECOND WORKOUT." [CLEARS THROAT] WELL, UM... YOU-- YOU SEE, UH... UH... WELL, UM... FRED? UM... DIDN'T YOU TELL ME, "FITNESS THE FAST WAY?" - GREAT. - YEAH-- THEN WE CAN FOLLOW IT UP WITH THE FAST "ER" AND FAST "EST." HELL, WE CAN BUNDLE IT WITH E-BOOKS-- "FRY YOUR LIFE AWAY," AND THEN YOU GOT SOMETHING. FAT AND FITNESS AT THE SAME TIME? LOVE IT. ANYTHING ELSE? NO. LOVELY. CAROL, IF-- IF I COULD JUST-- TANYA, I DON'T THINK THAT'S-- MS. HUFFLER, IT JUST TAKES A MINUTE. THAT'S ALL I-- YOU'VE GOT 10 SECONDS. - OH, UH, OKAY-- - 10, NINE, EIGHT-- OKAY, HERE IT IS. PAM JACOBS HAS SUBMITTED THE BEST DEBUT NOVEL I'VE READ IN YEARS, AND... I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE AN OFFER. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT YOU'RE THE CLASSICS EDITOR, RIGHT? YES. THAT'S STRANGE. I WASN'T AWARE THAT DEAD AUTHORS MADE SUBMISSIONS. IS IT A LONG-LOST MASTERPIECE? [STAMMERING] UM, NO-- I MEAN, NOT YET, BUT-- SO, IT'S A NEW BOOK? YES-- THEN THE LOGICAL QUESTION WOULD BE, WHY IS SOMEONE IN CLASSICS PITCHING ME A NEW BOOK? BECAUSE... IT'S A SEMINAL WORK. IT'S... IT'S A ONE-OF-A-KIND. IT'S A TRUE VOICE. AND IF-- IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT A CHANCE... YOU'LL BE MAKING A... HUGE MISTAKE. REALLY? YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. THIS BOOK IS THE REASON THAT WE'RE ALL HERE DOING WHAT IT IS WE DO. IT'S WHAT LITERATURE IS ALL ABOUT. IT'S WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE READING, AND, WELL... IT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE PUBLISHING. YOU REALLY MEAN IT, DON'T YOU? I DO. YOU'RE FIRED. WHAT? YOU BROKE THE FIRST RULE IN PUBLISHING. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT BOOKS SHOULD BE READ. IT'S ABOUT WHAT BOOKS CAN BE SOLD. [STAMMERING IN INDIGNATION] WH... CAROL HUFFIER, YOU KNOW... YOU ARE A HEARTLESS TYRANT, AND-- AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW A GOOD BOOK IF IT BIT YOU ON THE... BUTT! BEAUTIFUL CHOICE OF WORDS, NO LESS. YOU WILL GET WHAT'S COMING TO YOU. I ALREADY HAVE. LONG LIVE THE NOVEL! NOT A GREAT EXIT LINE. TELL ME ABOUT IT. - SHH! - SORRY. ANY MORE PITCHES TODAY? I DIDN'T THINK SO. WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY, CAROL? SHE'S A SINGLE MOTHER WITH TWO KIDS. I DIDN'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE. SHE LOVES THE BOOK. SHE WAS JUST FIGHTING FOR WHAT SHE BELIEVES IN. [SIGHS] I MEANT ABOUT HAVING KIDS. WELL... UH, WAIT, KENDRA? "TALK TO KENDRA." WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT? TODAY WAS THE DAY YOU WERE GOING TO... MAKE YOUR DECISION. DECISION? ABOUT WHAT? THE TRANSFER? TO LONDON? MY BOYFRIEND, ZAC, HAS A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT IN LONDON, AND I REQUESTED A TRANSFER. WHEN? A YEAR AGO, THE DAY HE WON HIS BID. WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS, CAROL-- AH, AH, RIGHT, RIGHT, NO, I-- I REMEMBER, AND, UH... I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT FIT FOR YOU. YOU KNOW I WANT TO GET INTO FOREIGN RIGHTS. IT'S THE PERFECT FIT. WHAT, YOU DON'T YOU THINK I CAN DO IT? WELL, IF I DID, YOU WOULD. LISTEN, KENDRA, YOU'RE MY SENIOR EDITOR, MY RIGHT-HAND WOMAN. EVERYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT PUBLISHING YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN RIGHT HERE. EVER SINCE EVE PASSED AWAY, I'VE MANAGED TO TURN THIS PLACE AROUND, AND NOW I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO SUPPORT ME. LISTEN. LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE-- NEVER PLAN YOUR LIFE AROUND A MAN. THEY'D NEVER GIVE YOU THE SAME COURTESY. [DOOR SLAMS] GLORIA, IT'S WORK. SOMEONE HAS TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. BUT MS. HUFFLER, IT'S CHRISTMAS. TRUST ME, MY MOTHER OF ALL PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND. SHE WORKED EVERY HOLIDAY WHEN I WAS A KID. BUT IT WOULD JUST MEAN SO MUCH TO HER. YOU MISSED LAST YEAR, AND I JUST THINK-- GLORIA-- [SIGHS] AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE THAT MANY MORE CHRISTMASES LEFT. GLORIA! PLEASE, JUST STICK TO YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION, AND KEEP AN EYE ON MY MOTHER, NOT ME. YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, MA'AM. GOOD. SO, GOODBYE, GLORIA. MERRY CHRISTMAS, MS. HUFFLER. [SIGHS IN DISAPPOINTMENT] THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE, "SCROOGE." I WATCH IT EVERY YEAR. AND SO DO I. YOU SHALL BEHOLD VISIONS OF A CHRISTMAS PAST, A CHRISTMAS PRESENT, AND A CHRISTMAS YET TO COME! EXPECT THE FIRST WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES MIDNIGHT.

WE GOT TWO WEEKS OFF FOR THE HOLIDAYS. ISN'T WORKING ON CHRISTMAS ILLEGAL? YEAH. SOMEWHERE IT'S GOT TO BE. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? REVOLT. NO, I'M SERIOUS! WHAT IF THE WHOLE OFFICE STAYED HOME? WHAT WOULD SHE DO, FIRE ALL OF US? YES. SHE'D HAVE NOTHING. WE'RE THE BACKBONE OF SPRINGWOOD. I MEAN, WE'RE THE ONES WITH THE POWER. WE SHOULD ORGANIZE OUR FORCES, GET TOGETHER, AND REBEL AGAINST CAROL HUFFLER AND PUT AN END TO HER TYRANNICAL RULE. COME ON, WHO'S WITH ME? SHE'S HERE. YOU LOOK SPECTACULAR TONIGHT, MS. HUFFLER. I HATE HER. [WENDY]: WAY TO GIVE IT TO HER, FRED. [QUIETLY] POWER TO THE PEOPLE. AMEN, SISTER. CHEERS. [WENDY]: YOU TOLD HER. [CHUCKLING QUIETLY] I LOVED YOUR LAST BOOK. WHAT WAS THE GENESIS FOR THAT? AND HOW MUCH INPUT DID YOUR WRITING PARTNER HAVE IN THIS ONE? KENDRA! THERE YOU ARE. OH, HI, CAROL. WOW, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, TOO, BABY. CAROL, YOU REMEMBER ZAC, DON'T YOU? I, UM... ONE MORE TIME? MY BOYFRIEND? THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO LONDON FOR TWO YEARS? OH, RIGHT, THAT ONE. THE FOOD'S TERRIBLE. HAVE A WONDERFUL TRIP. UH, OKAY, THANKS FOR THAT. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING TO DRINK? WATER. NOT TOO MUCH ICE. GOTCHA. WATER. CAROL, HOW ARE YOU? YOU HAVEN'T RETURNED ANY OF MY CALLS. I'M COMING WITH YOU. HELLO, PAM. SO I HEARD YOU FIRED TANYA FOR PITCHING MY WRITER. IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL. OH, I BELIEVE THAT. HOW COULD IT EVER BE PERSONAL WITH YOU? THERE'S A HUNDRED OTHER PUBLISHERS HERE TONIGHT, PAM. WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO ONE WHO WANTS TO LISTEN? BECAUSE I'M NO FOOL. YOU HAVE THE LARGEST MARKET SHARE, AND I WANT YOU TO MEET THE AUTHOR. OH, BEN! YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE TONIGHT? BEN WOODLEY! WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? COME HERE. NOT ONLY IS HE BRILLIANT, HE'S CUTE, A MARKETING SLAM DUNK. BENJAMIN WOODLEY, CAROL HUFFLER, PRESIDENT OF SPRINGWOOD PUBLISHING. HI, CAROL. BEN. HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? OKAY. WAIT A MINUTE, HOLD THE PHONE. YOU TWO ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER? YEAH, WE DO. YEAH. WE DO. OH. [AWKWARD CHUCKLE] WHO KNEW, RIGHT? WELL, YOU DON'T NEED ME HERE TO MESS THIS UP. - EXCUSE ME. - PAM! [SIGHS AWKWARDLY] SO, UM... FUNNY SEEING YOU HERE. OH, I'M NOT AN IDIOT, BEN. I KNOW YOU PLANNED THIS LITTLE SURPRISE. WHAT ARE YOU-- WHAT? THIS AMBUSH SO I'D BUY YOUR BOOK. NO, NO. HANG-- HANG ON. I SPECIFICALLY ASKED PAM NOT TO SEND YOU MY BOOK. WHAT? THAT'S RIDICULOUS. YOU'D BE A FOOL NOT TO SEND IT TO ME. [STAMMERS] UH, EXCUSE ME? I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU... UH, I'M CONFUSED. AM I STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY? YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME? [SCOFFS] LOOK, CAROL, I DON'T CARE IF YOU READ MY BOOK OR NOT, OKAY? OBVIOUSLY. I MEAN... LOOK, I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO READ MY BOOK, OKAY, BUT I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO, NOT AFTER WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH. THAT'S ALL I MEANT. WHAT'S IT ABOUT? THE LAST 10 YEARS OF MY LIFE. STARTING THE DAY YOU LEFT? I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS THE DAY YOU STAYED. I HAD A JOB, BEN, REMEMBER? SOMEBODY HAD TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I NEVER ASKED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME. BUT I DID, BECAUSE THE WAY I REMEMBER IT, YOU COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. I TURNED OUT JUST FINE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, THEN, YOU'RE WELCOME. HOW'S OUR REUNION COMING ALONG? IT'S OVER. THIS WHOLE HEARTLESS THING IS JUST A PHASE WITH HER, RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME. [CHATTING QUIETLY] WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THERE? [FRED]: OH, MY... THIS IS GOOD. MM... SHE'S HAVING A BAD DAY. - OH, MY GOODNESS. - TELL ME ABOUT IT. DID YOU SEE THOSE SHOES? [SNEERING LAUGHTER] CHEERS. [SIGHS] YOU OKAY? I'M FINE. YOU DON'T SEEM FINE. THANKS. VERY NICE. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE A LITTLE HUG. YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT BIG ON HUGGING STRANGERS IN BATHROOMS. WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT STRANGERS? NOW, TURN AROUND AND GIVE YOUR OLD BUDDY A LITTLE SQUEEZE. [GASPING IN TERROR] EVE? EVE MAILER? IN THE FLESH. WELL, MAYBE NOT IN THE FLESH, BUT YEAH, IT'S ME. WHAT-- WAIT, WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S OKAY. NO, IT'S NOT OKAY. YOU'RE DEAD! MAYBE, BUT YOU'RE RUDE. NO, I'M HALLUCINATING. IT'S FINE. THEY DID SAY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS. THEY? WHO ARE THEY? MY BOSSES. BOSSES? THE SPIRITUAL ENTITIES WHO OVERSEE THE BALANCE OF THINGS. WE CALL THEM "THE BOARD OF CORRECTORS." WHAT? IT-- IT'S FUNNIER IF YOU'RE DEAD. OH, SOMEBODY MUST HAVE PUT SOMETHING IN MY DRINK. YOU'RE NOT REAL. NONE OF THIS IS REAL. WHAT THE... [BEATBOX POUNDING] WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHERE AM I? YOU GONNA THROW UP? SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY THROW UP. WHY IS IT DAYTIME? WELL, A BETTER QUESTION MIGHT BE, WHY IS IT 1985? IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. NO... IT CAN'T BE. OH, MAN... YOU'RE GONNA VOMIT, AREN'T YOU? I AM GETTING THE HECK AWAY FROM YOU. AND DON'T YOU FOLLOW ME. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE LAMPPOST ON YOUR FACE. [GASPING IN PANIC] LOOK, LOOK, YOU ARE FREAKING OUT, AND THAT IS TOTALLY NORMAL. YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING TO ME. I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU TO WRAP YOUR BRAIN AROUND, BUT IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE YOURSELF OVER TO THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE-- WHOLE EXPERIENCE? YOU MEAN THE FACT THAT I'M DREAMING? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THAT'S IT. I'M DREAMING. THIS IS NOT A DREAM. YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S A NIGHTMARE. COME TO THINK OF IT, MAYBE IF I STOP TALKING TO YOU, IT'LL ALL GO AWAY. LOOK, CAROL, YOUR LIFE IS OFF COURSE, AND I'M HERE TO HELP YOU GET IT BACK ON-- [HUMMING LOUDLY IN DENIAL] LISTEN TO ME... CAROL HUFFLER! I'VE ONLY GOT ONE NIGHT TO MAKE THIS WORK, SO YOU'VE GOT TO WISE UP AND REALIZE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO MAKE A CHANGE. LOOK, THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A WHOLE NEW LIFE FOR YOU, BUT ONLY IF YOU WANT IT. IN THE END, THE CHOICE IS YOURS, AND YOURS ALONE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? MAYBE I'M IN A COMA. [MAN, OVER P.A.]: JUST A REMINDER, SHOPPERS, WE HAVE A SPECIAL ON LEGWARMERS ON THE THIRD FLOOR-- BUY TWO, GET ONE FREE. WHAT THE...? IS THIS...? I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THIS PLACE SINCE... 1985? IT MUST BE AN OLD MEMORY FROM MY SUBCONSCIOUS. HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN DREAMS. REALLY? I TALKED TO GLORIA ABOUT MY MOTHER EARLIER, I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP THINKING ABOUT HER, AND HERE WE ARE. ALL RIGHT, THEN, LET'S SEE HOW THIS GRABS YOU, THEN. MOM? MOM! SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU. YOU'RE A SPECTATOR THIS TIME. [TALKING SOFTLY] IS THAT... ME? WELL, IT'S NOT ELVIS. SHE WAS A HARD WORKER, WASN'T SHE? SHE ALWAYS USED TO SAY, "WORK TO LIVE, DON'T LIVE TO WORK," BUT SHE NEVER HAD A DAY OFF. EXCUSE ME, MISS HUFFLER? YOUR SHIFT IS OVER. YOU CAN PUNCH OUT NOW. OH, IS IT TIME ALREADY? HERE'S YOUR FINAL CHECK, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP THIS HOLIDAY SEASON. UM, SIR? EXCUSE ME... DO YOU REMEMBER LAST WEEK WHEN I ASKED ABOUT ANY FULL-TIME POSITIONS OPENING UP? I'M SORRY, BUT THE JOB WAS TEMPORARY. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. OKAY, BUT IT'S JUST, I REALLY LOVE WORKING HERE, AND I'LL WORK IN ANY DEPARTMENT. I'M SORRY. COME ON, HONEY. LET'S GO. DON'T WANT TO BE LATE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? SHE PICKED UP SHIFTS WAITING TABLES AT A DINER. HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? [DISDAINFULLY] HOW DOES THAT MAKE ME FEEL? ANNOYED. YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST A SILLY, SAPPY, IRRELEVANT DREAM, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS WHOLE THING IS INSANE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M STILL TALKING TO YOU. WE'RE NOT DONE YET, CAROL. YEAH, WELL, I AM, SO YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE HECK YOU WANT, BUT I'M OUT OF HERE. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT JUST HAPPENED? ABOUT 15 YEARS. OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU THIS, THIS IS THE REALEST DREAM THAT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS IS NOT-- OH, NEVER MIND, I GIVE UP. WAIT A SECOND. IS THIS... JIM'S BOOKSTORE? HEY, IT'S YOUR DREAM. YOU TELL ME. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THIS PLACE IN YEARS. WHY AM I THINKING ABOUT THIS? YOU USED TO LOVE COMING HERE. IS THAT ME? I LOOKED GOOD. THIS PLACE WAS YOUR SANCTUARY. I MEAN, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU GOT LOST IN A REALLY GOOD BOOK? YOU KNOW, I GOT TO HAND IT TO MYSELF, EVEN IN MY DREAMS, YOU'RE STILL THE SAME OLD EVE. OH, WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT "GETTING LOST" IN THE PAGES OF GREAT NOVELS, OR GOING ON LITERARY ADVENTURES. YOU WERE ALWAYS SUCH A SENTIMENTALIST. THIS IS WHAT WE DO, CAROL. WE PROVIDE THE WORLD WITH THESE GREAT STORIES. THAT IS WHAT PUBLISHING IS ABOUT. NO, IT'S NOT, EVE. IT'S ABOUT MONEY. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEVER GOT. IT'S ABOUT MOVING PRODUCT, AND THAT'S HOW I TURNED YOUR QUAINT LITTLE SHOP INTO THE GLOBAL PUBLISHING EMPIRE THAT YOU SEE TODAY. BIGGER DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN BETTER. REALLY? GIVE ME ONE EXAMPLE WHERE THAT'S THE CASE. JUST ONE? UH, TUMORS, HOLES IN THE ROOF, BUDGETS, COCKROACHES-- OKAY, FINE. YOU LACKED VISION, EVE. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. I CREATED A FAMILY AND PEOPLE WHO CARED ABOUT EACH OTHER AND THE COMPANY THEY WORKED FOR. THAT'S VISION. YOU NEVER COMPETED. YOU NEVER PUSHED THEM TO BECOME ANYTHING MORE THAN THEIR AVERAGE SELVES. WE WERE HAPPY! HAPPY? HOW CAN YOU BE HAPPY WHEN YOUR COMPANY'S ON THE BRINK OF FAILURE? WE HAD INTEGRITY. FINE, YOU DIED WITH INTEGRITY. AND A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT THAT I'VE TURNED INTO A MOUNTAIN OF PROFIT. BEST THING YOU EVER DID, EVE... WAS HIRE ME. [SCOFFS] I KEEP HOPING. SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO SIT HERE AND WATCH ME READ ALL DAY? IF THIS IS YOUR SHOW, HOW ABOUT SHOWING ME SOMETHING? THIS WAS THE FIRST DAY YOU CAME HERE. SO WHAT? YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY? NO... WHAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT OTHER THAN... PICKING UP A GOOD BOOK OR... [ENTRY BELL JINGLES] HEY, MAN. IT'S THE FIRST DAY I MET BEN. HEY. LISTEN, YEAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW'S IT GOING? YEAH, I PICKED UP THIS OLD COLLECTION OF TWAIN FROM THIS ENGLISH PROFESSOR AT DePAUL. WOW. YEAH, IT'S ALL BOXED UP IN THE BACK IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK. - OKAY, YEAH. - YEAH? WICKED. - OKAY. THANKS, JIM. - CHEERS. WOW... IS HE EVER CUTE. HE'S AVERAGE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. HE WAS MY BOYFRIEND. YES. YES, HE SURE WAS. HE'S THE ONLY PERSON YOU EVER LOVED. HE TAUGHT YOU THE MEANING OF THE WORD. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE TAUGHT ME THAT IT WAS JUST A WORD. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? HI. HI. YOU SEE THAT? NOW, THAT'S MAGIC. MAGIC? IT'S A CRUSH. A CHEMICAL REACTION IN THE BRAIN. THE PERFECT STORM OF LUST, YOUTH, AND INEXPERIENCE COMING CRASHING TOGETHER. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, I'M HUMAN. REALLY? 'CAUSE I WAS STARTING TO WONDER. GOOD BOOK. OH. IT CHANGED MY LIFE, ACTUALLY. UM... ME TOO. REALLY? BUT I HAVEN'T READ IT IN YEARS. WELL... WHO ELSE DO YOU LIKE READING, IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING? UH... HUGO, DICKENS, DOSTOYEVSKI... [TOGETHER]: TOLSTOY. [BOTH LAUGH] AM I THAT OBVIOUS? NO, NO. NO, I JUST, UH... WELL, YOU JUST LISTED ALL OF THE GREATEST WRITERS EVER. HEY, IF YOU LIKE THOSE GUYS, HAVE YOU READ THIS? GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ, "ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE?" NO. IT'S... I MEAN, TALK ABOUT ROMANTIC. IT'S MYSTICAL, KIND OF A HISTORY OF... A HISTORY OF... LIFE? I DON'T KNOW-- [SHUDDERS IN DISGUST] UGH. SERIOUSLY? "A HISTORY OF LIFE?" THAT'S THE CORNIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. DO YOU SEE THIS, HUH? I MEAN, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES? THE LOOK OF A NAIVE GIRL? IT'S BEEN A WHILE. AND WHAT ABOUT HIM, HUH? CHECK OUT HOW MUCH LIFE HE HAS INSIDE HIMSELF. HE'S TRULY INSPIRED! IS THAT WHAT YOU SEE? BECAUSE I SEE A DREAMER WHO WILL NEVER BE WILLIAM FAULKNER. THIS IS A BOY WHO BELIEVES IN WHAT HE LOVES. AND THAT'S A GIRL WHO LOVES WHO SHE BELIEVES IN. [SCOFFS] SORRY. NOT BUYIN' IT. AGAIN? COULD YOU WARN ME NEXT TIME YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT? NO. WAIT A MINUTE. I KNOW THIS PLACE. THIS WAS... OUR FIRST APARTMENT, AND IT HAS A HUNDRED STAIRS. WELL, YOU WANTED PRE-WAR, AND THAT MEANS NO ELEVATOR. I MEANT WORLD WAR II, NOT CIVIL WAR. SERIOUSLY? THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE GROUND FLOOR? NOPE. BESIDES, THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE OUR VIEW. WELL... WELCOME HOME. SAME TO YOU. WHAT'S THAT? REMEMBER? I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THE LAST TENANTS LEFT IT BEHIND. [CHUCKLING] WHAT IS THIS? DID YOU, UM... WHAT DID YOU DO? IT'S A HOUSEWARMING GIFT. WOW... REMIND ME, IS THAT HOW YOU SPELL "CRUSH"? THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW NOTHING THAT'S STOPPING YOU FROM WRITING THAT NOVEL. [♪♪] [LAUGHS] LOOK HOW GENEROUS YOU WERE. AND WHEN YOU GAVE BEN A GIFT THAT CHANGED HIS LIFE, YOU ENCOURAGED HIM TO PURSUE HIS DREAM. OH, RIGHT. THE GLORIOUS DREAM OF BECOMING A POOR, UNRECOGNIZED GENIUS. HEY, LOOK, HE WANTED TO BE A WRITER. YOU CAN'T FAULT HIM FOR THAT. I FAULT HIM FOR NOT BEING REALISTIC. WE WERE BUILDING A LIFE TOGETHER, AND HE WOULD'VE BEEN CONTENT LIVING LIKE A PAUPER IN SOME BOHEMIAN FANTASY. IT'S HARDLY A FANTASY TO BELIEVE IN YOUR DREAM. WITHOUT MONEY, THERE'S NO POINT TO DREAMING, IS THERE? HEY, WHEN DID YOU LOSE YOUR SOUL, CAROL? GOODBYE, EVE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? AWAY FROM YOU. AND THIS TIME, DON'T FOLLOW ME. OKAY, I WON'T. LOOK WHO'S HERE. [SLAMS DOOR] WHAT HAPPENED, FORGET YOUR KEYS? WOW, HAVE I MISSED YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT? STOP IT! I HAVE HAD-- YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONE CONSTANT IN EVERY GOOD STORY. THERE'S A BEGINNING AND A MIDDLE AND AN END. ALL I'M SAYING IS THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM AT SPRINGWOOD FOR MORE PROFITABLE BOOKS. WE CAN STILL HAVE GREAT LITERATURE AND SELL MORE COMMERCIAL BOOKS THAT HAVE A BROADER APPEAL. WE CAN MAKE THE COMPANY MORE COMPETITIVE INSTEAD OF SITTING ON THE SIDELINES. AND WHAT DOES EVE SAY? THE SAME THING SHE ALWAYS SAYS, IT'LL RUIN OUR REPUTATION, AND WE'LL LOSE THE AUTHORS WE ALREADY HAVE. - WELL, SHE'S GOT A POINT. - YEAH, WELL, SO DO I. AND I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT POINT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS NEXT WEEK, WITH OR WITHOUT HER SUPPORT. WHAT? WELL, I MEAN... EVE'S DONE SO MUCH FOR YOU, AND SO NOW YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUSH HER ASIDE? SPRINGWOOD CAN BARELY KEEP ITS DOORS OPEN BECAUSE EVE'S GOT HER HEAD IN THE CLOUDS. THE COMPANY NEEDS A NEW DIRECTION, AND I HAVE A PLAN. WOW. IT'S BUSINESS, BEN. YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND. REALLY? YEAH, SERIOUSLY, YOU SIT THERE IN JUDGMENT, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE THAT... WHAT? NOTHING. NO, SERIOUSLY, I WANT TO KNOW. WHAT? [SIGHS] IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE THAT AMBITIOUS, BEN. WRITING A NOVEL ISN'T AMBITIOUS? NO. WRITING A NOVEL ISN'T. GETTING ON THE BEST-SELLER LIST IS. ARE YOU SERIOUS? THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK I SHOULD BE DOING? I THINK ALL AUTHORS SHOULD BE DOING THAT. OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST WALLOWING IN MEDIOCRITY. SO, IN YOUR MIND, RECOGNITION IS WHAT DEFINES A GOOD WRITER? NO, SUCCESS DEFINES A GOOD WRITER. IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR LIGHTS ON, YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB. YOU KNOW, I... I KNOW THAT YOU HAD A ROUGH TIME AS A KID, CAROL-- YOUR MOM WORKING ALL THE TIME AND STILL NOT BEING ABLE TO SCRAPE TWO NICKELS TOGETHER. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT-- NO, LISTEN. BUT YOU MADE A CHOICE, TO NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY. I UNDERSTAND. I MADE THE SAME CHOICE, BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US IS THAT I DON'T NEED MONEY TO FEEL SECURE. I DON'T NEED MONEY TO FEEL... HAPPY. YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US. YOU'VE CHANGED. IT'S CALLED GROWING UP, BEN. CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT, BUT I MISS WHO YOU WERE. I MISS THE GIRL WHO USED TO LOVE READING BOOKS, WHO DIDN'T CARE SO MUCH ABOUT PROMOTIONS AND BOTTOM LINES. I MISS THE GIRL WHO GAVE ME THAT TYPEWRITER. I'M STARTING TO REGRET THAT I EVER DID. GOODBYE, CAROL. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. WHAT? ABOUT REGRETTING GIVING HIM THE REMINGTON. REALLY? WELL, THE TRUTH IS, IF I'D NEVER GIVEN HIM THE TYPEWRITER, WE MIGHT STILL BE TOGETHER, AND MAYBE I MIGHT NOT HAVE BECOME THE WOMAN THAT I AM TODAY. OH, YOU MEAN THE LONELY WOMAN WITH NO FRIENDS AND A HOCKEY PUCK FOR A HEART? GOODBYE, EVE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO DO WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO. END THIS. OH, COME ON. DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN, CAROL? YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY. I'M NOT WALKING THIS TIME, EVE. CAN'T DIE IN A DREAM, SO... SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. CAROL! IT'S BEEN... WELL, IT'S BEEN. WAIT! [SCREAMS, CRASHES] [CAT MEOWS, CAN ROLLS] IT WAS A DREAM. [♪♪] EVE MAILER. NOW, THERE WAS A CLASSY LADY. HEAR! HEAR! TWO WEEKS OFF FOR THE HOLIDAYS... A NICE LITTLE BONUS IN OUR STOCKING EVERY YEAR. AND SHE HAD IMPECCABLE TASTE. MM, IT'S TRUE. SHE COULD PICK A BEST-SELLER OUT OF THE SLUSH PILE. NO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT HER WARDROBE. YOU KNOW, I HAVE AN EYE FOR THAT SORT OF THING. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? CAROL HUFFLER IS GOING TO BE OUR BOSS FOREVER. NO, NOT IF WE ORGANIZE AND STAND UP TO THAT STALIN IN STILETTOS. PLEASE STOP WITH THE REBELLION TALK, FRED. I'M TRYING TO ENJOY MY DRINK. LOOK, WE WORK WITH THE AUTHORS, NEGOTIATE THE DEALS, EDIT THE BOOKS, GET THEM ON THE SHELVES, AND THEN WHO GETS ALL THE CREDIT? [TOGETHER] CAROL. EXACTLY. I MEAN, WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT HER? WHY DO WE EVEN NEED HER? TO SIGN OUR PAYCHECKS. WELL, WHAT IF WE SIGNED OUR OWN PAYCHECKS? FORGERY IS A FELONY, FRED. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FORGERY! I'M TALKING ABOUT STARTING OUR OWN COMPANY. DO YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN? LOOK, THE AUTHORS HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH US, NOT THE COMPANY. THEY DON'T LIKE CAROL ANY MORE THAN WE DO, SO WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL THEM UP AND ASK, AND THEN WE CAN BE THE MASTERS OF OUR OWN FATE. AND RUIN CAROL IN THE PROCESS. HMM. WHAT WOULD WE CALL IT? REVOLUTION PUBLISHING. VIVA LA REVOLUCION! NOW WHAT? WE SHOUT IT FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOPS. LET'S JUST MAKE SOME CALLS. THAT WORKS. OKAY, COOL. HEY, J.K. HI, ANGELINA? [SIGHING IN RELIEF] HELLO! [BREATHING SHAKILY] OH, COME ON, NOW, DON'T FREAK OUT, PLEASE-- DON'T FREAK OUT? ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M BEING HAUNTED BY MY DEAD EX-BOSS, AND YOU'RE TELLING ME NOT TO FREAK OUT? YES, BUT THE THING IS-- PLEASE! I CAN'T DO THIS. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. OH, COME ON, THE NIGHT IS STILL YOUNG. WAIT A SECOND. I KNOW THIS STORY. YES? YOU DO? YEAH... IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE, AND YOU'VE COME TO WARN ME THAT I AM SQUANDERING MY LIFE. OH, WHAT'S IT CALLED, UM... MIRACLE ON 34th STREET? NO. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE? NO! NOT STAR WARS? NO. "A CHRISTMAS CAROL" BY CHARLES DICKENS. OH, WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, EXCEPT IN THIS CASE, "CAROL'S CHRISTMAS." YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE? I FLIPPED IT. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN HERE TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE YOU FOR GENERATIONS. CHUCK WAS JUST THE FIRST GUY TO WRITE ABOUT IT. DID YOU JUST SAY CHUCK? AS IN DICKENS? INCREDIBLY SWEET GUY, OBVIOUSLY AWESOME WRITER. BUT HE JUST-- HE HAD A TENDENCY TO EMBELLISH A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, LIKE, THREE GHOSTS INSTEAD OF ONE, AND THEN TURKEY, INSTEAD OF JUST A SLAB OF MUTTON. YOU KNOW, LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT THEY DO ADD UP. OKAY, WELL, FINE, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I ALWAYS SAW SCROOGE AS THE VICTIM IN THAT STORY. MM-HMM. HE WAS JUST A MODEST, RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSMAN WHO WAS BULLIED INTO BECOMING A SENTIMENTAL SPENDTHRIFT. WELL, TAKE HEART, CAROL, BECAUSE YOU'RE HEADED FOR A LONELY EXISTENCE AND AN ETERNITY OF REGRET IF YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR LIFE. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. LET'S GO. WHOA, AREN'T WE A LITTLE EAGER BEAVER NOW. WELL, SINCE I'M BEING FORCED TO TAKE YOUR LITTLE MAGIC CARPET RIDE WITH YOU, I MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER WITH. SO... LET'S NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME, SHALL WE? WHAT YEAR ARE WE HEADED TO? THIS ONE. JUST SECONDS AWAY. [CAROL SCREAMS] [SCREAM ECHOES] [SCREAMING] OOF! [GRUNTING] ARE YOU HAVING FUN? A TOTAL BLAST. SWEET OF YOU TO ASK, THOUGH. WHERE ARE WE? HERE, FOLLOW ME. I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. OH, GOSH. WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS? WHERE ARE WE? HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN TO TANYA'S HOUSE? I DIDN'T KNOW TANYA HAD KIDS. THEY'RE PRECIOUS, NO? "PRECIOUS," FROM THE LATIN "PRETIOSUS" MEANING "EXPENSIVE." IT'S ALSO THE LATIN ROOT FOR "PRICE," AS IN "PRICELESS." OF COURSE YOU'RE SHOWING ME THIS. KEEP WATCHING. [CHILD]: WHAT ARE THOSE FOR? WELL, SANTA'S REINDEER NEED A SNACK, TOO, RIGHT? CAN YOU READ THAT? "DEAR SANTA, MAKE IT GOOD." [GASPS IN SHOCK] KIDDING! [TANYA AND KIDS LAUGH] ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TIME SANTA'S COMING, SO IT'S TIME FOR BED. OKAY? GIVE ME A HUG. I LOVE YOU GUYS. OKAY, OFF YOU GO. SO WHERE'S DADDY? DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT TWO YEARS AGO. SHE'S ALONE NOW. HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT? EVERYONE IN THE OFFICE KNEW, BUT DON'T WORRY. KENDRA COVERED FOR YOU. SHE SENT FLOWERS. WHAT'S SHE DOING? SHE HAS TO RETURN THEIR PRESENTS TO SAVE MONEY. LOOK, SHE SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO PITCH ME A NEW BOOK. SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO DO HER JOB. THAT'S NOT HER JOB! SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN HAPPY WITH THE ONE SHE ALREADY HAD, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHO WORKS FOR ME. WHOA, WAIT, BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP. YOU THINK THAT EVERYONE THAT WORKS FOR YOU IS HAPPY? WHY WOULDN'T THEY BE? [LAUGHS] I-- WAIT. I JUST-- I HAVE TO CAPTURE THIS LOOK OF TOTAL CLUELESSNESS. HANG ON A SECOND HERE. ALL RIGHT, SAY CHEESE. [SHUTTER CLICKS] [MUSIC AND LAUGHTER] WHAT? WHAT'S THIS? [ALL CHEERING] YES! WAY TO GO, GIRLS! SEE? THEY'RE HAVING FUN. THEY'RE GETTING THERE. [CELL PHONES RINGING] SHH, SHH, SHH! THIS IS FRED. UH-HUH. THE ENTIRE STAFF OF THE CHICAGO GUARDIAN, IN! [CHEERING IN TRIUMPH] OH YES! - ANOTHER ONE SCORED! - ANOTHER ROUND! IN? IN FOR WHAT? THEY'RE PLANNING A LITTLE CHRISTMAS SURPRISE. YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS, BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON CAROL'S FACE WHEN SHE COMES IN TOMORROW. I HOPE SHE GETS A WRINKLE. YES. RIGHT WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE IT! RIGHT HERE. VIVA LA REVOLUCION! VIVA LA REVOLUCION! DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON? WHEN I TOLD THE PRINCESS WE WERE STARTING OUR OWN PUBLISHING COMPANY, SHE SAID, "DO ME A FAVOR AND STICK IT TO CAROL FOR ME." [LAUGHING] THEIR OWN PUBLISHING COMPANY? NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. CAN YOU IMAGINE? OH, SO FUNNY. IS THIS A COUP? I MEAN, I WON'T STAND FOR THIS. STAND FOR IT? YOU'D BETTER MAKE SURE YOU CAN SURVIVE IT FIRST. I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME HOME RIGHT NOW. AH, CAN'T DO IT. I DEMAND IT! OH, YOU DEMAND IT. STILL, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. HEADS UP! [CORK POPS, CAROL SHRIEKS] THANKS FOR COMING WITH ME. ALWAYS. [SIGHING] OKAY, SO WHERE ARE WE NOW? OH, WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF ANYONE'S STILL LEFT IN YOUR CORNER. I WONDER WHY CAROL DISAPPEARED FROM THE PARTY. SERIOUSLY? WE'RE HAVING A PERFECTLY NICE TIME, AND YOU HAVE TO BRING UP THE MOTHER OF SATAN. SHE'S JUST-- I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER, THAT'S ALL. WHY? IT'S NOT LIKE SHE CARES ABOUT YOU. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? UH, WELL, LET'S SEE. UM, SHE TREATS YOU LIKE DIRT, SHE DIDN'T GIVE YOU THE TRANSFER, AND, WORST OF ALL, SHE'S MET THE MAN YOU LOVE MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES AND SHE CAN'T REMEMBER MY NAME! SHE'S NOT THAT BAD, ZAC. SHE'S JUST LOOKING OUT FOR ME. LOOKING OUT FOR YOU? YEAH. [SIGHS IN DISBELIEF] LOOK, KENDRA, I'M THE ONE WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR YOU, OKAY? I JUST THINK THAT YOU SHOULD QUIT YOUR JOB AND COME TO LONDON. AND DO WHAT? WRITE. YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO, AND NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME. I DIDN'T KNOW KENDRA WANTED TO BE A WRITER. THERE'S A LOT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT KENDRA, INCLUDING HOW MUCH INFLUENCE YOU HAVE OVER HER. [KENDRA]: ZAC, DON'T YOU SEE THAT I'M IN THE SAME PLACE CAROL WAS WHEN SHE WAS MY AGE? [ZAC]: BUT CAROL NEVER WANTED TO BE SOMETHING ELSE, KENDRA. IT'S DIFFERENT. WELL... THINGS CHANGE, ZAC. I HAVE A FUTURE AT THE COMPANY NOW. FINE. WHAT ABOUT OUR FUTURE? I DON'T KNOW. AMAZING HOW HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF. YEAH, BUT THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS, UNLIKE YOU, I DON'T PLAN ON GETTING HIT BY A BUS ANYTIME SOON. I DIDN'T PLAN ON GETTING HIT BY A BUS. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR KENDRA'S DECISION, OR ANYONE ELSE'S, FOR THAT MATTER. YOU KNOW, LIFE IS ABOUT CHOICES, AND KENDRA'S GOING TO RUIN HER LIFE, IRONICALLY ENOUGH, WAITING AROUND TO BECOME YOU. WELL, THEN, KENDRA SHOULD CHOOSE TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT SHE WANTS. OR YOU COULD CHOOSE TO GIVE HER THE TRANSFER AND LET HER BE WITH ZAC! WHY SHOULD I? OH, GOD, LET'S SEE. OH, BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN INCREDIBLY LOYAL TO YOU. TO MAKE HER HAPPY. OH, HAPPY. HAPPY! HAPPY. WHY? WHY SHOULD I TRY? I TRIED TO MAKE BEN HAPPY, AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT ME. WHY SHOULD I BOTHER MAKING ANYONE HAPPY? LET ME SHOW YOU. I'M... I'M SCARED. [BIG THUMP] I CAN'T SEE-- HANG ON, HANG ON, I GOT IT. WHERE ARE WE? - OW! THAT'S MY FOOT! - SORRY, SORRY. SORRY, SORRY ABOUT THE CLOSET. I WAS NEVER THAT GOOD OF A DRIVER. ARE WE BACK IN THE PAST? NO, IT'S STILL YOUR ROOM, JUST THE WAY YOU LEFT IT. SHE... SHE HASN'T CHANGED A THING. YOUR MOM LIKED IT THIS WAY. WAIT. CHECK THIS OUT. SHE REMEMBERED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO YOU. SHE KEPT THEM ALL. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN FOR YOUR INTERVIEW, AND YOU WENT ON AND ON AND ON ABOUT ALL THESE BOOKS THAT YOU LOVED. WELL... HERE THEY ALL ARE. I HAD NO IDEA SHE STILL HAD THEM. THEY'RE SORT OF PIECES OF YOU, RIGHT? [DISHES CLATTERING] [MOM]: GLORIA, YOU CAN AT LEAST LET ME HELP. [GLORIA]: NO. YOU JUST STOP ARGUING WITH ME. YOU KNOW, I CAN MANAGE ALL THIS STUFF ON MY OWN. WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN, BUT MAYBE I CAN'T. [CHUCKLING] THANK YOU. IT'S BEEN A WHILE, HASN'T IT? NOW, I'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT. GLORIA, IT'S CHRISTMAS TOMORROW. YOU'VE GOT TO GO HOME AND BE WITH YOUR FAMILY. HUSH, NOW. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. THEY'RE ALL OUT OF TOWN, AND BESIDES... YOU ARE FAMILY. I REALLY MISS HER, GLORIA. I KNOW YOU DO, DEAR. I JUST WISH SHE WOULD DROP BY TOMORROW, THAT'S ALL. I KNOW. BUT I UNDERSTAND. SHE IS SO VERY BUSY. SHE HAS SO MANY BIG THINGS GOING ON AND PEOPLE TO SEE, AND... I JUST MISS HER. [CRYING SOFTLY] OOH, I ALMOST FORGOT! THIS CAME FOR YOU TODAY WHILE YOU WERE OUT. WHAT? FROM... IS IT FROM CAROL? I'M SO SORRY I FORGOT. KENDRA. AGAIN. YOU SEE A PATTERN EMERGING AT ALL? SHE'S ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. OH... OH, THAT'S... OH... I REMEMBER THAT CHRISTMAS. YOU TWO LOOK SO HAPPY TOGETHER. YEAH. YEAH. YOU MISS HER, DON'T YOU? OF COURSE I DO. THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE HER MORE OFTEN? IT'S JUST BECAUSE-- IT COULDN'T BE BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE HER, IT REMINDS YOU OF THE TOUGH TIMES YOU HAD WHEN YOU WERE A KID? LOOK, I JUST-- I'M A BUSY WOMAN, AND I... THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE TIME FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE. WAIT A SECOND, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT I DON'T LOVE MY OWN MOTHER? OF COURSE NOT-- BECAUSE I PAY FOR THIS HOUSE, FOR THE GROCERY BILLS, FOR GLORIA'S SALARY. - EVERYTHING! - YEAH, THAT'S GREAT. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO GIVE HER TIME. TIME IS EXPENSIVE. ACTUALLY, NO, TIME DOESN'T HAVE A PRICE. YOU CAN'T BUY IT, AND ONCE IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE FOR GOOD. OH, HERE WE GO, THE REQUISITE LECTURE ABOUT HOW TIME SLIPS THROUGH YOUR FINGERS. EVERY MOMENT I DON'T SPEND WORKING IS MONEY LOST. REMEMBER WHAT YOUR MOTHER SAID? "DON'T LIVE TO WORK. YOU WORK TO LIVE." ALL SHE EVER DID WAS WORK! YEAH, BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. YOU DO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GIVE THAT BACK. THAT'S MY BOOK! WAIT. YOU DID IT AGAIN. WHERE ARE WE? WE ARE AT SUSAN JOHNSON'S HOUSE. I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS. [PLAYFUL GROWLING, THUMPING] GUESS WHO CAN'T SHAKE ME. TOP ROPE! [GRUNTING] I GOT YOU! BEN? WAIT. HE'S MARRIED WITH KIDS? HE IS NOT MARRIED, YOU IDIOT. WELL, THEN, EXPLAIN THIS. OH, YEAH? LAY OFF YOUR UNCLE, BOYS, HE'S AN OLD MAN NOW. AW, NOT THE CHICKEN WING! GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH AND GET IN BED. AW, FIVE MORE MINUTES. NO. NOW, PLEASE. THANK YOU. HEY, WHERE'S MY HUG? GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT, UNCLE BEN. - GOOD NIGHT. I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE TO TUCK YOU IN. - GOOD NIGHT! - GOOD NIGHT. PHEW! [SHE CHUCKLES] FINE. OR IT'S HIS SISTER. LET'S MOVE ON. THEY LOVE HAVING YOU AROUND. SO DOES BILL. HE GETS TO WAKE UP WITHOUT BLACK AND BLUE MARKS ALL OVER HIS BODY. THEY'RE GOOD KIDS. I ENVY YOU GUYS. I MEAN, WHAT GOOD IS CHRISTMAS WITHOUT KIDS, HUH? WELL, TRADE IN THE BACHELOR LIFESTYLE AND HAVE SOME, THEN. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AN AUNT. GOT TO FIND THE GIRL FIRST. AND YOU GOT TO GET OVER THE OLD ONE BEFORE YOU CAN DO THAT. COME ON, BEN. I'M THE BIG SISTER. I KNOW EVERYTHING. OF COURSE YOU DO. I SAW HOW NERVOUS YOU WERE EARLIER TONIGHT BEFORE THE PARTY, OKAY? JUST THE THOUGHT OF SEEING CAROL HAD YOU ALL WORKED UP. OH, COME ON. YOU CAN'T LIE TO ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. REALLY? WELL, THEN, TELL ME THIS. DID YOU SEE HER? OKAY, YOU WANT TO KNOW? FINE. YES, I SAW HER, AND IT DIDN'T GO SO GREAT. I MEAN, WE SAID HELLO, AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE WERE FIGHTING AGAIN. RIGHT BACK WHERE WE LEFT OFF. WAIT, YOU GUYS DON'T SEE EACH OTHER FOR WHAT, 10 YEARS, AND THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS HAVE AN ARGUMENT? WHY? WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO. LOOK, YOU KNOW, IT'S... IT'S FINE, OKAY? SERIOUSLY. IT JUST PROVES THAT I WAS RIGHT TO WALK AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. DON'T. YOU STILL CARE ABOUT HER. - HANG ON-- - BEN... DON'T GET ME WRONG. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT, BUT THE FACT IS YOU GUYS WERE JUST KIDS WHEN YOU BROKE UP, AND YOU DIDN'T TRY THAT HARD TO STAY TOGETHER. AND IF YOU'RE STILL FIGHTING AFTER ALL THIS TIME, THERE'S FEELINGS THERE, AND IF YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH HER, YOU'VE GOT TO TELL HER. NO. THE WOMAN I SAW TONIGHT IS NOT THE WOMAN I FELL IN LOVE WITH, NOT ANYMORE. SEE, NOW, I DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY THAT, AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S NECESSARILY HOW HE REALLY FEELS. CAROL? [ANGRILY] WHY WOULD YOU SHOW ME THAT? WHERE DID YOU GO? OH, IS THAT IT? IS THAT WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO LEARN? HMM? YOU SHOW ME THAT I'M NOT ALONE, TELL ME I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY MOTHER, AND THEN YOU SHOW ME THAT BEN DOESN'T LOVE ME ANYMORE. SHOW YOURSELF, YOU COWARD. ANSWER ME. PLEASE. [LETS OUT A SHAKY BREATH] OKAY, WHAT'S IN STORE, EVE MAILER? LET'S SEE HERE. GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST, THAT'S OVER. THEN WE'VE GOT A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. A TON OF FUN. SO, WHAT'S NEXT? OKAY, HERE WE GO... AH, CHRISTMAS FUTURE. "IN THE ORIGINAL DICKENS STORY AND SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS, "THE APPARITION APPEARS TO THE PROTAGONIST "AS THE ANGEL OF DARKNESS "OR THE GRIM REAPER, "MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS... DEATH"? [STAIR CREAKS, CAROL GASPS] EVE? WERE YOU SCARED? TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME TIME TO COOL OFF. IT WAS BETTER IN REHEARSALS, BUT YOU GET THE GENERAL IDEA. SO, THE FUTURE? LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT OR ANYTHING, BUT... I KNOW I DIE IN THE END. REALLY? YEAH, EVERYONE DOES. YOU CAN'T REALLY GET AROUND THAT ONE, CAN YOU? YOU MIGHT JUST FIND YOURSELF SURPRISED. THIS DOESN'T LOOK VERY FUTURISTIC. OH, YOU'RE COMING UP ON 40 PRETTY QUICK, LITTLE LADY. THIS IS BASICALLY NEXT WEEK FOR YOU. I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT. WHERE ARE WE? IT'S CHRISTMAS MORNING, AND THIS IS YOUR FAMILY. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. THESE ARE ALL MINE? YEAH, YOU AND BEN HAD THREE KIDS, AND... ONE, TWO, THREE GRANDKIDS SO FAR. [SON]: YOU'RE SPOILING THEM AGAIN. WE'RE THE GRANDPARENTS. IT'S IN OUR JOB DESCRIPTION. HOLD ON. SO... THIS IS MY FAMILY, AND THAT... THAT'S ME? AND THAT'S BEN. PRETTY BEAUTIFUL VISION OF THE FUTURE, NO? OH, MY GOD... I THINK YOUR PRESENT IS THEIR FAVORITE ONE. SWEET, ISN'T IT? SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? [BOTH CAROLS TOGETHER]: NOT TOO SHABBY. YEAH, NOT TOO SHABBY AT ALL. [TEARING PAPER] OKAY, SO WHY THREE KIDS? I MEAN, DO I LIVE ON A FARM NOW, OR WHAT? GRANDMA, LOOK! LOOK AT THIS. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS, EMMA? SANTA BROUGHT ME THE DOLL I WANTED! SANTA BROUGHT THIS TO YOU? AS IN SANTA CLAUS WHO DELIVERS PRESENTS TO ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS WHO WERE GOOD LAST YEAR? THEN YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL. DOES SHE HAVE A NAME? I LIKE "KATIE." SO DO I, SWEETHEART. AWW. SHOW YOUR MOMMY. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE? HEY, CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THANK YOU. FOR WHAT? FOR GIVING ME ANOTHER SHOT. AND WITHOUT MISTLETOE, FOLKS! SO THAT'S IT? A HAPPY ENDING? WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT, BECAUSE I AM SURPRISED. OH, THIS, THIS ISN'T YOUR FUTURE. YOU'RE TEASING ME? THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY POSSIBLE FUTURES. THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER ONE. AND I'M GUESSING WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER TWO ISN'T GOING TO BE SUCH A PARTY. OH, NOT AT ALL. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [RAIN PATTERING] WHAT NOW? TURN AROUND. THIS WAY. UGH. NO DATE? WELL, I'D TELL YOU, BUT THEN I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU. HEY, IT'S JUST ANOTHER DOOR. WELL, LIKE I SAID, EVERYONE DIES. TRUE, BUT EVERYONE DOESN'T NECESSARILY DIE ALONE. IT'S ALREADY OVER? NO ONE CAME? OH, SOMEONE DID. SHE JUST GOT HERE LATE. HOW ABOUT THAT... I DIDN'T GET YOU FLOWERS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HATE THEM, SO... SHE'S THE NEW PRESIDENT AND, IN HONOR OF YOUR MEMORY, SHE DEEMED TODAY A WORK DAY. SHE THOUGHT YOU'D APPROVE. I WOULD HAVE. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE COME ANYWAY. SHE LOOKS DIFFERENT. SHE LOOKS... SAD? [CELL PHONE RINGS] THIS IS KENDRA. NO, NOW WORKS. I'M JUST WALKING OUT OF A MEETING. TELL ME... THEN DUMP HIM. HE'S COSTING US MONEY AND WE NEED TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. I'M IN CHARGE, AND IT'S MY CALL. A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK, HUH? SO THE COMPANY SURVIVED? THERE WAS NO REVOLT? OH, NO, THERE WAS A REVOLT, AND PEOPLE HAD A TOUGH TIME FOR A WHILE, BUT... I WON. YEAH, YOU FIRED EVERYONE BUT KENDRA, AND YOU ESTABLISHED YOUR REPUTATION AS A WOMAN TO BE FEARED. AND IN THE END... I'M ALONE. IS THERE A DOOR NUMBER THREE? THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU. EVE? EVE, WAIT. EVE! I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE. YOU'RE RIGHT. I WANT TO CHANGE! PLEASE. HELP ME. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT!

YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR ME, KENDRA, OVER THE YEARS-- IT'S MY JOB. NO, GETTING MY MOTHER A CHRISTMAS PRESENT BECAUSE YOU KNEW I'D FORGET, THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING.

YEAH, ABOUT THAT-- NO, NO, I LOVED IT. MOM, I KNOW HOW HARD YOU HAD TO WORK WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. HONEY, IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD FOR YOU, TOO, BEING DRAGGED AROUND FROM JOB TO JOB. BUT YOU ALWAYS MADE SURE I HAD A GREAT BOOK TO READ. NOW, WITHOUT MY BOOKS, I WOULDN'T HAVE MY WONDERFUL LIFE. I OFTEN WONDER WHAT YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ME BACK THEN. I THOUGHT YOU WERE A DEVOTED MOTHER WHO LOVED ME VERY MUCH. I JUST WANTED YOU TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I DIDN'T. AND IF I'VE NEVER SAID IT BEFORE, THANK YOU. [SIGHS HEAVILY] I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND MUCH LATELY. THAT'S OKAY, HONEY. YOU'VE BEEN BUSY. WORK TO LIVE, MOM, NOT LIVE TO WORK. THOSE WERE YOUR WORDS. WISE WORDS. FROM A WISE WOMAN. I... I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT. YOU DID? YEAH. IT-- IT WAS YOU, BUT YOU WERE OLDER. YOU WERE ABOUT MY AGE. IT WAS CHRISTMAS, AND... YOU HAD YOUR FAMILY ALL AROUND YOU. ADORING CHILDREN LOOKING UP. THERE WAS A MAN. HE WAS... IT WAS BEN. DO YOU REMEMBER BEN? THAT BOY YOU USED TO DATE? HE WAS SO CUTE. YOU TWO SEEMED SO HAPPY. WE WERE. AND THEN... HE LEANED OVER AND WHISPERED SOMETHING IN YOUR EAR, AND... WHAT WAS IT HE SAID? IT WAS, UH... [♪♪] HE THANKED ME FOR GIVING HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. RIGHT. WELL, THEN, MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

I LOVE YOU, MOM. I LOVE YOU TOO. WHERE'D CAROL GO? UM... TO GET HER MAN. [RINGS DOORBELL] [SIGHS NERVOUSLY] HI, SUSAN, IT... IT'S ME, CAROL HUFFLER. YEAH. I REMEMBER YOU. UM... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WELL, I... THOUGHT BEN WAS HERE. HE'S NOT. OH. HE LEFT THIS MORNING. REALLY? I-- I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT-- HE ALWAYS SPENDS CHRISTMAS ALONE. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WELL, HE DIDN'T ALWAYS DO IT. HE... STARTED WHEN YOU GUYS... WELL, YOU KNOW. DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT? HE MIGHT BE GONE THROUGH TO THE NEW YEAR OR LONGER. I COULDN'T SAY. WELL... THANKS. IS THAT...? YEAH. HE, UM... HE LEFT IT BEHIND. SAID HE DIDN'T WANT IT ANYMORE, AND... HE TOLD ME TO SELL IT. MAY I? OH, SURE. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING? NO. THANKS. I'M FINE. LISTEN, I KNOW YOU AND BEN HAVE HAD YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE PAST, BUT IF I HEAR FROM HIM, SHALL I TELL HIM YOU DROPPED BY? NO, IT'S OKAY. HE'S BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING. I'LL JUST LET MYSELF OUT, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. TAKE YOUR TIME. THANKS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. CAROL? UH... I THOUGHT YOU LEFT. WELL, I DID, BUT I, UH... I CAME BACK. WHAT FOR? SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY FROM. BEN, I... I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING-- - WAIT, UH, CAROL-- - LET ME TALK. LISTEN TO ME. I... YOU WERE RIGHT. I DID CHANGE. I... TURNED INTO SOMEONE THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE HER ANYMORE. [SIGHING] LISTEN-- NO, I NEED TO BE A BETTER PERSON, BEN. DON'T YOU SEE THAT? AND I'M ASKING YOU TO HELP ME GET THERE. I KNOW WHO I WAS AND WHERE I CAME FROM, AND NOW I KNOW WHERE I WANT TO GO. OH, CAROL... BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE ANYMORE, BEN. WE'RE NOT MEANT TO BE ALONE. I KNOW THAT NOW. I PUSHED YOU AWAY WHEN YOU NEEDED ME THE MOST, AND FOR THAT, I'M SO SORRY. I KNOW NOW SHARING LIFE IS WHAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING, AND I WANT TO SHARE MY LIFE WITH YOU. [LETS OUT A BREATH] I, UH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T WALK AWAY. WELL, I MEANT FROM THE TYPEWRITER. WHAT? YEAH. IN THAT CONDITION, IT'S WAY TOO VALUABLE JUST TO SELL IT. YOU SON-OF-A... I REALLY, REALLY LIKED YOUR SPEECH. [LAUGHING] YOU'RE MEAN. NO, I LEARNED FROM THE BEST. I READ YOUR MANUSCRIPT. YEAH? WHAT DID YOU THINK? WELL, I THINK THAT, UM, YOU NEED A COMPANY THAT CAN TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE OF YOU. YOU THINK I NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF? WE ALL DO.
