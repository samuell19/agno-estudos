Soon Baron Tulicò's carriage will be passing by, and the boss isn't here. - Who is the boss? - Babalone, right? Babalone owns only half of this gang. I inherited the other half from my father. Margherita, you're saying this because the boss can't hear you. He hears me, he hears me. Isn't that so, Babalone? Take off your fake nose! This nose is mine, and it's real, whether you like it or not! I'm disguised like this to be a lookout without being recognized. According to my plan, you should be on the street disguised as a damsel who stops the Leopard's carriage. If my information is exact, he is going to his lover, Maria Rosa, the clairvoyant. This time he won't reach destination. You have Babalone's word, the Genius of Evil! Just think, Margherita, with the ransom money we'll be rich and can finally get married. I'll never marry you, Babalone. Don't get your hopes up. We are just in business together. Listen... Why does everyone call this Baron Tulicò the Leopard? We're at the start of the movie and you want to know these things. - Idiot! Get out of the scene! - Alright. Don't get upset. Understand? As soon as Margherita has stopped the carriage, when I nod, you will attack. Where? The Redshirts have arrived. - Why did we stop? - The Redshirts, Excellency. All we needed was these nuisances! - Who will take care of Margherita? - I will. - Shall we go home? - Go. You bring bad luck! We're leaving! I am Lieutenant Teofilo Bellingeri. Why are you here alone? My stagecoach was attacked by bandits. I managed to escape. Scoundrels! They take advantage of the war to act as bosses in Sicily. But when the Bourbons will be defeated, we'll wipe them out. - Who is in the carriage? - The Leopard. Don't be funny! My God! Well? What is it? Are you afraid? You've never seen a leopard in a carriage? - No, I haven't. - It's the emblem of my coat-of-arms. - I always take it with me. - Who are you? I am Baron Fifì Tulicò, known as the Leopard. I am Sergeant Nando Tazza of General Baldigari's army. I have the Bourbon and Garibaldi pass. Which do you want? Neither. Go ahead... Go on. Let's go. What characters! There are madmen in this area. If you told this to someone, he wouldn't believe it. My Margherita! My Margherita! How frightening! What terrible bandits, my Margherita! Thank heavens that you are integral and untouched! - Is she your mother? - No, I am her nanny. - Your heart is beating so fast! - It's not beating, dear! - Yes, it is. - It isn't! - Is it or is it not beating? - It's not beating! Go on, valorous Garibaldi soldiers! - Follow the bandits. - Which way did they go? - That way. - Grandma, you want to argue? I am going to exterminate that gang of thieves and be right back. Young man, I feel shivers down my back. Excuse me! I didn't think... Sergeant, on horseback! Gallop! - Go on, move! - Never a couple of steps on foot. Don't you ever again take advantage of such a situation, or I'll have you pay for it! Understand? I see that you like that lieutenant. We are two brothers, famous and extraordinary. Wherever we go we destroy evil. If you have relatives whose teeth hurt, or a little brother whose tummy hurts. If your sister-in-law is an alcoholic. If you have a sister who suffers from gravel, if some bigot aunt has gout. Of your wife is in bed with labor pains. If Granddad Bellissario has tapeworm. Or one of your cousins has a closed intestine. If your boyfriend is all messed up. Or your servant has pimples in his rear end. If the promised bride feels something. Or if your girlfriend is ailing who knows where, come to us, to him, to me. We are healers who come from afar where we place our hand illness goes away. We are healers who are well known. We need only touch and the ailment goes away. Alright. What do you want to tell me? Speak up. Maria Rosa, we must put an end to our 32 year old relationship. It can't be! You can't leave me after I've given my youth to you! I gave you the best years of my youth! - You are crazy! - Calm down! - You know that I still love you. - And so? - This is beyond our control. - Beyond? Nothing can be stronger than the passion that devours us, and that still today has us cry out with pleasure. - There is a force majeure. - What is it? - The lack of money. - How can that be? You, the Leopard, the richest man in the city! - How can it be? - I am ruined, Maria Rosa. I know why you're ruined! You go to that awful club every night - and play "chimney infernal"! - It's called "chemin de fer". Whatever it's called, you're an idiot. What club? What club? My inventions have remained dead in this underdeveloped country! They cost me all my family wealth. Nobody ever believed in my radio-television, in my phone without wires, in my pibigas! Everything is still in the basement, without a name, without a patent. - Poor Fifì! - All I have left is the balloon now. No! You even have a hernia now? Hernia? I'm taking about my latest invention, the hot air balloon. I must complete it and then sell it to the Garibaldi and Bourbon army as a secret weapon. And you think I am interested in money? Ungrateful. You want to leave me for a handful of coins. Don't you realize that my love for you has no second interest? I will follow you through tick and thin. Kiss me, my little Leopard. - I can't find money with you here. - Why? Do I bring bad luck? No, but I won't be able to marry a rich woman. Now I understand! There's another woman! Out with her name! Give me her address! - I want to scar her with vitriol! - Don't threaten! I don't even know the name of the woman I will marry. - Liar! - I'm desperately looking for her. I unleashed all the ruffians and will sacrifice myself in marrying her. - I will marry her without love. - Why? To be able to complete my balloon with her money! Again with that disgusting balloon. You compare me to a street walker. You know what? I hate you. I despise you! You disgust me. You're becoming vulgar, my little one, and I am sorry. Poor me! Where are you going, gigolo? Goodbye, my lovely lady. Let's part with no hard feelings. Wait! Wait! Woe is me! How unfortunate I am! If on that sad day I hadn't left my little ones on the steps of the church, you'd be mine! With the same bond and the same blood as your children! Where are my children? Where are... I am fainting... My children... The little ones. Hurry, ladies and gentlemen! We'll only be here a couple of years. - Hurry up! - One of my canines hurts. We preferred a cat, but come forward with the dog. - Please. - The canine... It's painful. - He's suffering. - Have you been suffering many years? - Brother, on with the operation! - I'm going, brother. - Please, sit down. - Will it be very painful? Don't worry. I’ll put you to sleep. - Ready, brother? - Yes! Look into my eyes! There. - Wake up! Did you feel pain? - No, just a head-ache. I use this technique. Come! Does anyone else want to have a tooth pulled? I know you two! You're the ones who gave me this gift! - Look who is here! - I'll show you! Let's run, Ciccio! What does he want? Ciccio, what is he doing to you? Get out of here! What do you want from us? - Ciccio! - Follow me! - Be careful! - This way. Let me by. I'll close the door! - My gosh, how scary! - It was a close call. That horrible giant! - Where did we end up? - I don't know. - Who is it? - Who are they? - They are embalmed! - Embalmed? - Then we're in a museum. - Of course. Look. You see? Touch. Oh, the serpent! Embalmed... Ciccio, look. - Perfect. He looks like you. - Don't be an idiot! - Let's see... - Excuse us. - Is anyone here? - May we? Ciccio, look. This one is moving! He's alive! Good-day, gentlemen. Are you the museum director? No, I am Maria Rosa, the clairvoyant. I read the present, past and future. Lucky you who can read everything! We are illiterate. That's scary! Yes, everyone tells me that. I am forbidden to pregnant women and children. No, silly. The resemblance is amazing with my mother, poor soul. I feel honored. Poor thing. Lucky you who had a mother! We are orphans. - That's scary! - Me too? Sit down, boys. I want to take a clear look into your past. If you would reveal something to us about our past, we'd be happy and honored. Is anyone here? - I see... - Where? - I don't see anything. - I see. I see. I see! Your father. - Our father? - Yes. He's a cat. - We are sons of a cat? - No. Not a real cat. - Take a good look. - A tomcat? - Puss in boots? - A foreign cat? - A French cat? - A feline? A leopard? Oh, yes! We are sons of "Brut" Lancaster! Be quiet, Franco. - Did you call him Franco? - Is it forbidden? - Then you are Ciccio! - How do you know? She is a clairvoyant! Tell me... In which church were you abandoned? - They found us in the trash. - When? - We don't remember. - The date coincides! Then you are... You are Ciccio and Franco! Oh, God, I feel sick! Children! My children! Yes, I am your mother! Embrace me! Here I am! Mom! All my love I give to you! - Mom! - My sons! - Mom! My mom! - I'm so overjoyed I feel sick. - Help Mom! - Sit on Mom's lap. Kiss your mother. We have finally found you again, dear Mom. I am so happy! Franco, you haven't changed at all. I remember you as if it were today when I put you in the trash bin. - What about me? - It was tough to push you inside. - I had to fold you over. - I remember. Come to me, my adored and lovely sons. Now I know why I saw that ugly exotic cat. - You don't know, but I'll tell you. - Yes, tell us. Listen closely, my children. You are the sons of a piton and a leopard. Were we born in a zoo? Listen, children, and don't be funny. Your father is Baron Fifì Tulicò, known as the Leopard. - Mom, you made the right choice. - No, my handsome sons. I didn't. Your father is a son of a dog. - We are a dog's grandsons? - Wasn't he a leopard? A leopard, but still a dog. He seduced me and left me, taking the best years of my life. Don't cry. We'll have them returned to you. How? Only the fear of a scandal would bring him back to me. Listen carefully. Listen carefully, my sons. Go to the club of the nobles where that scoundrel goes every night. Tell him who you are, or whatever, but bring him here. Don't worry, Mom. We'll bring him back to you. - Dead or alive. - Alive! Alive! - It would be eerie to see him dead. - Right. I was about to fall. - How "cheek"! - You say "chic", but speak less. Francesco, I feel that I belong to this aristocratic world. Do you gentlemen want something? Chemin, roulette, baccarat? What? - No, thank you. I don't drink. - I am waiting for Fifì Tulicò. His Excellency isn't here yet, but he'll be here soon. Sit down. - Are there seats? - As many as you want. This way. Enjoy yourselves. The house with 5,000 ecus. Lovely lady, come here. Will you accompany a poor old paralyzed man - to the roulette table? - Don't be an idiot. Take off your fake nose. We still recognize you. Why did you come? - For Tulicò's operation. - I was enough. No, we own the gang together. Until you decide to become my wife, - I will keep an eye on you too. - Let's go. - What is it? - My hand is stuck. Judging from the pain, I massacred my phalanges. Who is the house? Is someone the house? - Who is the house? - House! - Who called the house? - My brother. I did. Would you like to get the cards? - Five! - You can't bet with five. We bet the way we want. You'll do a "suivi", gentlemen? A suivi? - Do we want a "sweet"? - No, thank you. - We don't like sweets. - Are you calling the house again? - Yes, just to please you. - House? No, gentlemen. Would you cover, to begin with? No, we aren't cold. - You must cover the table. - We must cover the table! - What are you doing? - I'm covering. You must cover with 5,000 ecus. Did you call house or not? - You must pay 5,000 ecus. - Whoever says house must pay. - Of course. You lost. - He's crazy! - You must pay. I won. - Mind your own business. Who is he? I bet 9. You, only 5. - Do you know who we are? - What is he saying? - I will cause a scandal! - How dare you? - We are two proper people! - Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Inspector! Inspector! - Mind your own business. - What happened, gentlemen? - This gentleman wanted... - One at a time, please! I know who this man is! He's the barber. One at a time, please! - One at a time... - That is the "Turandot". - Well? What happened? - Let me explain, and I'll explain! - Don't sing! - I'm not singing! That man with a shovel in his hand. He's a bricklayer or a baker. At a certain moment he said, "Who is calling house?" I am an aristocrat, and so I said, "We must help him." I said "house" and he gave us two cards. Maybe they were his. If this Mr. House isn't here yet, why should we pay a 5,000 ecus fine? Let's be reasonable. - I see. You aren't members. - No, we're brothers. - We're here for a family research. - In what sense? - We're looking for the Leopard. - Baron Tulicò. Also known as "our dad". - You are the sons of... - Yes, of the Leopard! - Can't you tell? - Then everything changes. That man uses my system and he always wins. I don't know if you know who I'm talking about. That tall blond man... My gosh! I risked having a heart attack. Your illustrious parent enjoys an unlimited credit. - Dad enjoys. - Can we enjoy too? Of course. Pay the debts of the little barons. Ciccio, did you hear? We are "little barons", his heirs. - The sons of Leopard? I've an idea. - This surprises me. You'll see what the Genius of Evil is capable of. Lead the way to the hideout. - You can go on betting. - We aren't professional betters. That is very funny! But then, nobody is funnier than your father. - There was a misunderstanding. Dad! - Where are you looking for him? - Where will I find him? - Let's ask the doorman. Excuse me, good man. What time is Baron Tulicò arriving? Excuse me, gentlemen, but I fear that tonight your father isn't coming. How do you know that Dad isn't coming? Besides being a good friend of the marquis, I am also his neighbor. - I know he's not going out tonight. - Why not? Because... Because he fears an attack. Dad fears an attack? Then he's sick! No. What did you understand? An attack from the Redshirts, on the city. Oh, the Redshirts! Yes. He hates war. You know what your father is like. Of course we do. Two eyes, two arms, two thighs... He is well built. - When did you see him last? - At birth. At birth! Since the birth of the Bourbon-Garibaldi conflict. That's totally different. Alright! I am his neighbor and will accompany you to him. - Are you happy? - It is an honor for us. Your kindness humiliates us. Excuse me. I didn't introduce myself. May I? Count Wheat. - We are the little barons. - Little barons. I am happy to give you a ride. - Thank you. - What are you doing? Go! Go! - Not with this! - Shall we push it? There's no need. My wheelchair is light and easy to handle. - You are Whole Wheat then! - That is really funny! We're leaving. If Dad looks for us, we are at the Count Bread's house. Marquis Blind? - Good evening, Countess. - Countess? I am Don Basilio. Who? Don Basilio? Yes, the marriage matchmaker! - Let's say the ruffian. - Let's say it! Any news? There is a match for Marquise Priscilla, your daughter. Great! Would he be willing to marry her right away? - Yes, immediately. - This gentleman... Does he know about the small family flaw? Yes. He knows that the marquise can't see past her nose. - He knows? - Yes, but it doesn't matter. Don't keep me guessing! Tell me the name. Baron Tulicò, alias the Leopard. - The Leopard? - The Leopard. - My carriage is downstairs. - Alright, we'll go there. - It is the loveliest in the city. - Is that what everyone says? Well, everyone should mind his own business. Let's hurry. I don't want to risk ugly encounters. Are you afraid of the bandits? Gentlemen, I need your help. Let us take care of it! Wait! You're not accompanying us? We killed him! We killed Dad's friend! - Look. He's getting up and walking. - Yes! - He's walking! - Miracle! Miracle! I almost got run over by the wheelchair that fortunately stopped in time. This is it. Does Dad live here? Don't be impatient. Here. He took his nose off. But... Where is Dad? Where are we? Who are you? You're in the hideout of the Monreale bandits. I'm not Count Wheat, as I told you, but Babalone, also known as the Genius of Evil! My God! Look at that! Ciccio, where did we end up? They aren't aristocrats. Where did they come from? Who are they? You're surrounded by my clan with its cavalry. Now I understand! We were kidnapped. We are not girls in marriageable age. We're men. - You are very valuable hostages. - What did you say? I never repeat what I said. Until your father pays the ransom, you will remain here as my welcomed guests. - I cut my finger. - He cut... Just a moment! Our welcomed guests. Don't forget that you're not the only boss of this gang. This must be clear to everyone! During their stay here, these two men must be treated with the utmost respect. - Right! - Understand? Naturally, Margherita dear, but if Baron Tulicò should not pay the ransom, we'll cut the heads of these pleasant little monsters. Ciccio, did you hear? They want to cut our heads. Don't worry. He's our father and the voice of blood will say, - "Pay! Pay!" - What if he doesn't pay? - We'll bankrupt. - How shameful! Get closer, Don Basilio, don't be afraid. - How cute! - What were we saying? Upon signing the marriage contract you'll have 10,000 gold pieces, and just as much after the wedding, plus a production bonus for every male child. The rest at the death of the dad. - How is Dad? - What dad? - Marquis Blind. - Fine. That's very bad! What does my future bride look like? - She's alright. - Explain that. - She has a small physical flaw. - Paralyzed? - No. She can't see very well. - I see. She's half blind. As they say, "noblesse oblige". To complete my invention, I am willing to do anything. It must be done before the war ends or who will I sell it to? - Would you like a drink? - Yes, thank you. A non-alcoholic orange juice? Don't be afraid. It's an electric appliance that I invented. You put the fruit there and the liquid comes out here. Very practical, huh? Drink, to the balloon! - It isn't good? - Disgusting. The contraption isn't quit perfect yet. - Have the contract prepared. - Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Let me by! Let me by and don't squeeze! I don't like lemonades. Oh, you're here! - The ruffian is here too. - Mrs. Maria Rosa. I hope he found you a rich woman. Answer! I hate vulgar scenes, especially in the presence of strangers. Go, Don Basilio. Leave me alone with the lady. You called me "lady"! Then you'll marry me. - I can't, I told you. - Oh, Fifì! Fifì! Do it for our love, for the passion that devours us. Think about it. No, please, don't touch me! When you touch me, I lose my mind! You betrayed yourself, you still like me. - I must forget you. - Shall I do a strip-tease? Shall I do the seven-panties dance? - Don't get close! - You want it? Why? Why? - I wouldn't resist. - It's what I want. - What do you want? - Your love. I want to be yours. Alright, you won. - You're singing? - I am happy. - I realized you will marry me. - Who said? - You said it. - We'll meet after the wedding too. Scoundrel, delinquent! Do you think I'm a concubine? All because of these disgusting balloons, and that awful cat that looks at me! I know how you'll end up! - I'll deflate your balloons. - No! No! - Not the balloons! - Yes! Yes! Yes! - I will destroy you! - My balloons! I will do it! If I can't do it because I'm a poor, defenseless woman, - my sons will take revenge. - Who? Yes, my sons! You'll have to recognize them legally because they're your sons too, - the Leopard's sons. - My sons? You asked for it, Fifi. Goodbye! Goodbye! You will remember me. My sons? What sons? This woman will ruin me! - Help! - What is it now? Help! Isn't anyone in this house? Help! Who are you? What do you want? Come down from there. I am a bandit, not a tamer. I have a letter from my boss, Babalone. Here. The answer is urgent because I can't stay in this position anymore. "Baron, your sons are in my hands." "If you don't give 2,000 ecus to my man," "tomorrow you'll receive their heads." - That woman is capable of anything! - The answer. I can't stand it. Wait. I'll give you what I owe. Pippo, entertain the man. No, don't leave. Excellency! Pippo... "Respectful head of the bandits." Trippone's tavern. Host, empty the cantina. We'll have a big dinner with the baron's money... Excuse me, lovely lady. Are we important guests or not? Of course! How do you explain that we ordered spaghetti "al dente" and received spaghetti with a denture? Excuse me. It's not my fault. I'm not taking it out on you, marvelous girl! Every time I see you, my heart begins to thump. Tell me something. Are you happy with all these petty bandits? Since there isn't a Prince Charming, I have to make do. There are 2 barons here. Run away with us after the ransom is paid. Don't joke about it. If my boyfriend hears you, he'll kill you. - Who is your boyfriend? - That ugly one. - You're everyone's girlfriend! - No. Iron Moustache. She's Iron Moustache's girlfriend. We don't give a darn about him! - Come. - We'll show you. Excuse the interruption. Is Mr. Iron Moustache here? - I am he. - It's him! Let me see. Iron Moustache, the real one! It's him! May I? May I? Open your mouth. Are you crazy? What's inside your head? My gosh! What's in my head? - Are you making a fool of me? - Of course. - Try again, if you have the courage. - I'll please you right away. Please. Please. You're served. - What did you do? - Scrambled eggs. - I will kill you! - Calm down! Calm down! The Leopard is very rich. Kidnapping his sons was a fantastic idea. That's for sure, I am the genius of evil. Anyway, you should get used to the idea of buying a wedding gown. We'll invite the most important bandits of Italy to our wedding. Shall we invite Gasparone and Fra Diavolo as witnesses? Think about finding witnesses in your favor when you'll be put on trial for kidnapping and blackmail. The Garibaldi courts are very severe with bandits. Right! And his officers are very gallant - with beautiful girls. - I don't know what you mean. I've decided to leave the gang. I leave to the poor my part of the ransom for those losers. - Corbucci will decide that. - What is going on? - Let me go. I'll kill him! - You've a family. Don't do this! I'll make mats out of them! I will sue him! Everyone stop! What is going on here? Mr. Wheat, will you tell this irritable young man that we are precious hostages? That we are the ransom! Let me go! Babalone, he gave me an egg shampoo! Good for him. You didn't follow Margherita's orders. - A guest is sacred, to be respected! - A guest is like a fish. After three days it stinks, but he was born "stinky"! Darn! If you offended my brother, you offended me, too. I won't forgive you! Take this! - You hit the wrong target. - So I noticed. There's nothing to laugh at. You two, pray to all the gods for your father to pay the ransom, or I'll have your head cut off! - He'll pay. - Let's kill them right away. You be quiet! I am the Genius of Evil here! - The ransom! - Dad recognized us! Dad recognized us! Open the bag, Margherita. - It's gunpowder. - It must be black gold. - What did you do? - The baron gave me a letter. - Probably a check. - Maybe. We'll see! Read, Margherita. I've ricotta cheese everywhere. - Excuse me, mister ricotta cheese. - Be quiet. - I just wanted to say something. - What does it say? "Respectful bandit Babalone, I am sending you gunpowder for you to avoid the expense of having the brains of those two imposters who pass themselves off as my sons, explode." "The Leopard". Is that so? Can we go? - We have an appointment. - Stop right there! This appointment must be postponed. - I won't have your heads cut off. - Very kind of you! I'll be generous. We'll do something that entertains everyone. - Really? - We'll do a carousel. A carousel! I've always liked carousels. A carousel! A carousel! - Thank you. - Enjoy yourselves! - Best wishes! - Thank you. This carousel doesn't convince me. Why did they tie us here? We'll have great fun! Ring around the roses, a pocket full of posies... Now we'll toast to the two... This is not funny. I violently hit my nose with the top. Charge! Are you turning around? Hey, listen... "If he keep on turning, his brains will pop out and the people present will be entertained." Cesare Borgia, "The Tortures", chapter III, paragraph II. Watch out what you do. I don't want to be guilty of any crime. It'll be a warning to who wants to pay us back like the Leopard. Your father would have done the same. He became a bandit for revenge, and never killed helpless people. He never got ricotta cheese in the face. You want revenge for that. Ciccio, I am seasick! They're starting again! They're starting again! - I'm turning! - Murderer, what are you doing? Be careful with that ball! Cuckold referee! - Enough. Stop! Enough! - That's enough? We aren't harming them. They are hitting their own selves. It's a useless torture. Better to kill them right away! Mind your own business! I think you are right. In fact, I'll kill them myself. No! No! Mr. head of bandits, think about it. Give me a hand. My foot! Help me up, but slowly. Idiot! What goes around, comes around. The Bourbons are coming! - What is it? - Ciccio, the Bourbons! Dad sent them to save us! Everyone stop! Nobody move! - Who is the head of the gang? - Me! Help me. Let me hide. - Who is the boss here? - Me. Then let's speak clearly. I should hang all of you, but if you help us fight the Garibaldi men, you'll receive a prize. We must see if the others agree. - Are you or are you not the boss? - She is in business with me. My word goes for all the 63 members of the gang. 65. There are also those two. - What are they doing? - Playing statues. - We were playing a game. - I'll show you my plan. Mr. Bourbon commander! You're leaving us here? - Liberate those two men! - Long live the Bourbons! Long live the Bourbons! Whoever goes against them, dies! Down with Garibaldi! Down with Garibaldi! Long live the Bourbons! Long live the Bourbons! We are here. This is the road. The town is here. And here... Here there's my right hand that you are cutting in half. Move it! Here there's the camp site of a Garibaldi legion, commanded by Lieutenant... - Bellingeri. - Bellingeri, exactly. He changed the position to surprise us from behind. - What is so funny? - What do you mean? We must destroy that legion! What have we got to do with it? Your gang, led by one of us, will attack the camp from behind. Taken by surprise they will not have a chance to escape. - My compliments, Commander! - Thank you. This is a plan that is worthy of the Genius of Evil. - Who is he? - Me, modestly speaking. My pleasure. Compliments on behalf of Margherita too. She'll be glad to witness the end of one of Garibaldi's gallant officers. What do you say, dear? I say that if you don't raise your hands right away, I'll blow off your heads! Stop, Captain. I know Margherita very well. When she says this, there is no way out. - If you say so. - Long live the Bourbons! - Long live the Bourbons! - What? Long live Garibaldi, the great emperor! Get undressed! Take off your uniforms. - Do she want to have an orgy? - No orgy! We'll escape dressed as Bourbons. Margherita, don't exaggerate! You won't make it. - Be quiet! Close his mouth! - I'll do it! A ricotta cheese... If I may, this time I'll do it myself. He learnt! - Will they put uniforms on us too? - They'll put striped ones on us. - With a nice rope collar. - Iron Moustache, I don't understand. - I don't understand a thing. - Update yourselves. With who? People don't want to talk to us. May I have a word, Commander? You're the eggs guy! - That way! - They undressed us! Stop them! Stop them! They are running away! Run away, Margherita, but you'll regret the Genius of Evil. I've never liked ricotta cheese. - Do something! - What are you waiting for to shoot? My gun isn't loaded! Gallop! Whip the horse! Go away! "Vade retro, Satana"! Hurry! They're reaching us! Filthy Bourbons! - Who are you? - The town is down there! Run! - Run, my little horse! - Come on! We're in the town. Let's get off. I'll help you, miss. Thank you, miss bandit, for having saved our lives! Forget it. I had to run away too. Let's not waste time, and look for Dad. Ciccio! Look at how these strawberries are moving! - No, they are Redshirts! - Redshirts? Long live Garibaldi! - What are they doing? - Don't run away! Wait! Come! - You? - They're running off. What'll we do? If we don't do anything, Garibaldi will be disappointed. - Follow them. - By ourselves? - Obey orders! - Let's go, guys! They aren't Bourbons! Let them go. Forward, men! Darn it! Run! Catch them! Let them go, Lieutenant. They are two miserable men who helped me run away from the bandits' camp. Don't worry. Shortie will never catch them. I want to enlist with the Redshirts. It's amazing how at times dreams can become real. Everyone stop! Sword. Hat. It's them! Where're they going? I'm Nando Tazza, known as the hound. Sisters? Sisters? - Excuse me, I am injured. - Oh, an injured man! - A car accident? - No. They are war injuries. - I pricked myself with a pin. - Poor thing. We'll take care of it. Sister Ciccia, the bandages. Yes, sister. - Do you play war too? - Yes. - Which side are you on? - With Garibaldi, sister. Oh, "Canibaldo"! Did you do some campaign? - Yes. I took Marsala... - The wine? No. Marsala is a town. The "Canibaldino" is a pleasant guy! If I find a little Bourbon, I'll eat him alive. It's Nando Tazza's word. I've finished. Don't let him catch cold. Sisters, excuse me, but I am following two Bourbons. One is little, and looks like a criminal. The other is very tall, little eyes, an idiotic face with... Sister, do you have a moustache? A mustached sister is always appreciated. Sister Francesca, I remind you that we must visit the father. - What father? - Our father. Right. Our father who are in Heaven... What are you looking at? Making fun of me? The sisters! It's them! Alarm! Alarm! Come! Because of that disgusting moustache they almost recognized us. Get undressed. Nobody will see us here. They're celebrating Garibaldi. What do I care? I want my dad. Dad! Where is he? - Where will we find Dad? - Let's look for him! Here they are! Get them! Run! Here is the salvation hole! Stop! Something stinks! It's the sewers. They'll never come out! The rats look like wild boars. - Where are we? - In the sewers. - Disgusting! Let's go back. - Oh, sure! They'll grab us. Yeah, they'll kill me and then you. Excuse us. Is anyone here? - Are there lions in the sewers? - No. - Then it was a kangaroo. - That's nonsense! I should come in the water? What if I get wet? Ciccio, the water reaches my knees! The water reaches my stomach! - It's an optic illusion! - An optic illusion? The water is reaching my chest, my throat. Ciccio! Will you stop it? Walk as I do. Look. Ciccio! My Ciccio! - Ciccio, you float well. - I am lighter. Go on! Move! Don't worry. We'll end up somewhere. Come. Ciccio, you won't believe me, but I feel all wet. Of course. The temperature is humid in the sewers. Come. Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Don't leave me. I'm afraid. - Be quiet. - Where do we go from here? - There is a road. - Is it one way? Come. Come. There's a short cut here. I feel the ground giving out under my feet. I'm drowning! - Come! - Don't you see I am stuck? Pull me out. We got the wrong canal. It was a very difficult enterprise. - That way! - That way. Come! - There are some clothes there! - Let's hope they fit us. - Hurry! Someone can come. - Thieves! I told you! - Thieves! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - I'll kill you! - They stole the shirts. Run! - Get them! - To the right! Run! - Where are we going? - This way. Nobody is here! Let's hope so. This way! Let's go! - The bull ruined my pants! - Let's hide in the barrel! This is the barrel! What are you doing? Come! If I catch them, I'll kill them! - Long live the king! - Long live the king! Long live the king. - Did you see two Redshirts? - Did you see two white ones? Are you making fun of me? You want to be shot? We're looking for two thieves who stole our shirts. I don't care about your shirts! We're looking for Garibaldi men. Are you perhaps on Garibaldi's side? No funny business! Long live the king! - Long live the king! - Long live the king! Eat and drink. It's all at your disposal! - He's crazy! - What do you people say? - Go to Milazzo. - Are there Garibaldi men? - It's full of them. - I'm going to Catania! - Eat, sergeant! - Thank you. Nice grapes! I want to take some to... What grapes are they? - The Redshirts! - Our shirts! - Arrest them! - The firing squad! Garibaldi men? We don't know this Garibaldi! We're subjects of the Bourbon king of the reign of two Sicilian peninsulas! - With those red shirts? - The grapes stained them! Enough! Have the courage to know how to die. We have no experience. It's our first time at dying. - Let's not waste time. - We're not in a hurry to die. - Come on! The blindfolds. - What are you doing? - Proceed. Hurry! - Ciccio! Ciccio, I can't see anymore! Long live Palermo and the entire province! Charge! Aim! - Ciccio... No, don't do it! - Stop! Stop, captain, general, admiral... Whatever you are! Stop. Don't stain yourself with this horrible crime. Don't let them die without the comfort of the faith. - Go on, hurry. - Thank you, captain, colonel, general... Whatever you are. - My sons! - Dad! - Dad, did you come to free us? - I don't know your father. I'm a simple Cappuccino monk passing by this area. I saw you're about to die in an atrocious torment, so I thought that maybe you had some money put aside to give me some charity. - Do you have money? - We don't have a cent. - Are you absolutely sure? - Very sure! In that case, shoot them! They're already dead broke. - No. It's a judiciary error! - Aim! Forward! Valorous, Garibaldi men, catch the Bourbons! Forward! - The usual ball breakers. - We surrender! Come on, guys! Disarm them and pile up the arms! - What is going on? - Someone must have come. Search the prisoners! To Town Hall to raise the Italian flag! Ring the bells! We won! Help me get off. Hurry! Free us. Go away! I'll do it myself! Ciccio, look who is here. Ugo Tognazzi! - The magnificent cuckold! - Alright. I am glad to have saved your life, heroic sons of... - Of nobody. - Only momentarily. Are you a part of "the thousand"? You were at Quarto, right? - No, I wasn't. - Alright. - Sergeant, do you know them? - Of course, General. - They are two Bourbon spies. - Then let's shoot them. - That man of the church! Come. - Me? - Aren't you a man of the church? - Of course I am. Then confess these two traitors. Have them give you... - They don't have money. - Their last wishes. - We want to talk to our lawyer! - We are honest men. Honest? Proceed. Shoot them. - Do you agree? - Of course! Lieutenant, prepare the firing squad! - No! What're you saying? - We must give an example. An example must be given! You must set an example, General. No! No! Do you have a license to kill? - Get ready! - No! - Are you crazy? Don't shoot! - Aim! - Have him say "fire"! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Sons! My sons! Stop! - Murderers! - Mom! - Move, you idiot! My sons! - Mom! Mom, save us! They want to kill us. - He wanted to kill us. - So grown up and playing war? Aren't you ashamed? - Is this the "Befana"? - Are you their mother? You don't look like them. So young, so lovely. You have all the fascination of the Sicilian women. The passion of the women that perturb men of the north. Lucky is the man who made you a mother. The father of these two children, after having seduced me, - left me. - A scoundrel! I could remedy that, if you will allow me to. I am also willing to pardon the life of your sons - in exchange of your graces. - That's a good one! - The use of words... - You are funny! My sons, this goofy blond, nice guy, - has a lot of class. - You really think that? May I hope? Free these two men immediately! - Thank you, General. - I want you to become my wife. I confess that until today I had never met anyone so passionate and impulsive. I am a man of immediate decisions. - Father, will you marry us? - I am not authorized. Thank you, but I am not ready. A woman needs time to get ready. I've always dreamed of marrying with a white dress and a bouquet. A bridal gown isn't important, right monk? He isn't a monk, but the bandit, Babalone! Stupid! You're squealing on me? You won't catch me! Catch him! Catch him! Stop that scoundrel! You will hear more talk of the Genius of Evil! Here I am, Baldigari, but only for a few seconds. My children are still shaken and frightened. Two shootings in the same day doesn't happen every moment. I take this occasion to thank you for having saved their lives. - I will be eternally grateful. - I don't want your gratitude. I know, but unfortunately my heart belongs to someone else. Yes, a scoundrel who doesn't want to marry you. I know everything, but not his name! Maria Rosa, I am crazy about you. I feel something for you too. Maybe if I'd met you before... Who knows. It's too late now. - Let me at least hope. - Why? To avoid that I die. One can die for love. - You are so poetic! - General! The troop is ready. Goodbye, I'm going. I'm participating in a reception. I am a witness for the signing of the wedding contract between Marquise Blind and Baron Tulicò. - Maria Rosa, do you feel ill? - No, I'm just a bit dizzy. What is it, Baldigari? Will this contract be signed by this evening? Yes. It'll be a torture to see the joy of their dream coming true. - My love, don't cry. - I'm going. Goodbye, Baldigari. Goodbye, hero of two worlds. I'm going to my children. - Goodbye! - Maria Rosa! Why? Why? Oh, silly heart, what tricks you are playing on an old soldier! General, she stood you up. How dare you, stupid shortie? - How do you feel, my sons? - Destroyed. Since you recognized us as your sons, we've been through so much. We were tortured by the bandits, chased by the Redshirts, kicked by a bull, and partially shot by the Bourbons. We even ended up in the sewers! I know. The worst is over. All that remains is small stuff. Understand? No! We're going back to being travelling healers! Really? There! You ungrateful children! You want to go away and leave me in this mess? Your father is about to unjustly marry. That coward! Let him marry. What do you care? I noticed that the Garibaldi officer showed a particular interest in you. Yes, that big blond man declared his love. But I love Fifì, my Fifì. Give me my Fifì. Did you hear that? Mom, think it over! The officer seems like a good Republican match. - The heart has a mind of its own. - It can't be commanded. That is why you must help me. Tonight your father will sign a marriage contract with Marquise Blind. What does this Blind have more than I do? What? How can we help you, if we don't know anyone? You must cause a scandal. That way your father will return to me. You silly boys. You don't know what your mother is capable of. I will have you hired as waiters in the Blind home. I have friends, I know the butler. A young girl's fling. Dear Pippo, I can't take you to the reception. Don't look at me like that. Your life would be at stake. My future father-in-law is a passionate hunter. As soon as he sees an animal, he shoots. But when he sees a husband for his daughter he gives 10,000 gold pieces! That's right. 10,000 pieces. That is why you must remain home. I am going to sign the marriage contract. Bye, Pippo. Beautiful, magnificent! All full of gold. Look at how much gold! I say that Dad has more. - Did you know Dad is almost a king? - Then he's a horse! No, the kind on cards, but those who have princes. Oh, I see! They send their kids to nursery school. Beautiful! Look. It's entirely made up of precious stones. Good thing the butler had us hired! You think he has something going with Mom? - What do you care? - I'll knife him! I'm going, my little balloon! With the marquise's money you will fly and the Leopard will again roar! Majesty! Come closer, Baron Fifì. - Majesty, you're in Sicily? - We are incognito. We come from faraway Turin to inform you that you were nominated accountant to the Kingdom of Piedmont. Kneel, Leopard! A madman to trust the words of the Genius of Evil! A little champagne! A little champagne! Dad, why isn't he here? Don't worry. He must be stuck in traffic. - You want a drink? - No, I am too nervous. Why isn't the baron coming? Maybe he had second thoughts. No. What are you saying? My child, don't be upset. Don't worry. Baron Tulicò will come. He is a man of honor. Where are the drinks, please? - On the other side. - Here? - Water... - I'll do it myself, thank you. - Fire! Fire... Fire! - I understood! Fire! Fire! Fire! I told you there was a fire there. Idiots! What the devil are you doing in my home? - Who are you? - Nobody can offend us! - I can offend you! - We are proper people. If anyone dares offend us, we'll kill him! - Who are you? - We are the sons of our father! - How astute! Who is your father? - The Leopard. He's here. - Fifì! - Go receive him. Hurry! If I can get my hands on the count's golden coins, - I will emigrate to America. - Dad! Dad! What is going on? These two obnoxious guys again! Get him! Get him! Who are you? My gosh! My adored Dad, finally we have found you! So handsome! You are smothering my ears with saliva. Who are you? We are your sons, your own blood, little Leopards, your coat-of-arms, Dad! You must give us 30 years of kisses. You dumped us in a trash bin. - But destiny had us unite again. - Bad luck had me meet you. - What did you say? - A nobleman's mumbling. Listen, Dad. We must return home. Our poor mother is waiting. She's been waiting 30 years. You must marry her, Dad! When a man of honor seduces a woman, if he doesn't want to be stabbed, he marries her of his own free will. We have orders to have you marry Mom or there will be a scandal. - I'll undress and say everything. - No need. That is why I am here, - for your lovely mother. - You're here for Mom? It can't be! You're not here for her, but to marry Marquise Blind. No, my handsome lambs! Who told you that? Someone vulgarly deceived you. Now I'll explain. Marquis Begalini, in following the procedure of aristocrats, must give a big advance on an amount that I am entitled to. - Is that clear? - Oh! No. The marquis must give me money! The marquis doesn't want to give the Leopard his money? - Your father! - This marquis makes me laugh! Dad, you're under the protection of the sons of the Leopard. They don't fear anyone. Water wets them and wind dries them. We'll go out there and have him give you the money. Come, brother! A little kiss to Dad. - The Leopard! - Known as Fifì. Dearest Baron, on behalf of the Blind of the Sightless, I thank you for the honor you are showing us. - When you will receive... - The money! - No. I am here for... - The loot. - No. I'd like... - The dough! - No. I don't see the notary. - Everything is ready. Please wait for our best man, General Baldigari. - The famous enemy of the bandits? - Precisely, Baron. - While waiting, have something. - I would have... - The coffer. - With the dollars, the pesetas, the florins, the marks, the pounds, and the francs. - We'll have everything! Here. - That coffer is mine! These valets are so likeable that I almost consider them my children. - Children? - Whoever touches children dies! I'll have you die, if you don't go in the kitchen right away! Go make some cakes. Go on! What are you doing? Can't you see? I don't see my future wife, Priscilla. Don't worry. She can't see you, either. - Then we're even. - Precisely. - General Baldigari. - Let him in. Darn it! General, this way. - My leg... - Where are you? - The hat, thank you. - Please. He's blind. General Baldigari with his general staff! At ease. Let's stipulate this marriage contract. Who is the groom? The general is in a hurry. He is chasing the bandits - that are infesting the area. - Don't make him waste time. - Where is the groom? - Here he is. Baron Filiberto Tulicò, known as the Leopard. What are you saying, Dad? He is Fifì. Yes, excuse me. Your moustache confused me. Dear Baron, the Sicilian nobility is that part of the population on which we Republicans are mostly counting on. The presence of the Garibaldi forces in the liberated island, is a guarantee of security, of order, of law! I, General Baldigari, solemnly swear it! In 100 years there will be no more bandits in Sicily. - Nor will there be any crime! - Bravo! Just a moment! He is not the Leopard. He is the bandit Babalone. Get him! Get him! My feet! Watch out! I just killed my back! My sons, they are chasing me to oblige me to marry the marquise! - Defend me from those men! - We'll stop them! Get up! What are you doing there? - Did you hurt yourself? - Come on, my general! Come on, Ciccio! I tricked you! You tricked me. Let's join Dad. Come on! There are no indications for an escape. That way! - Stop! Stop! - Dad! Dad! Dad, wait for us! We're coming with you! - What is he doing? Flying? - Dad, wait for us! - We're coming with you! - Go away! - Are you pretending to be taller? - They're stealing my balloon! - That way! - It's getting away! Dad, are you having us fly like bats? - Scoundrels! - Dad! - Help me up! - You're stepping on my callous! - Where are we going? - Dad, your bags fell! You're still here? Take this! - Help! Help! I'm flying! - Dad! - I'm flying! - Dad, save your little leopards! Take this too! - Dad, what are you doing? - Why do you treat us like this? - He likes to play games. - I can't stand it anymore! Let us in! Dad! Let's get him! You don't know who I am! I'm looking for my balloon! I'll turn to Mazzini and to Cavour too! Dad, if you let us in, we'll scratch your back. Idiot! Here he is... - General! - You go... Sergeant, please. I've a bit of a head-ache. Let's go! - Come on, Miss! - Miss? What's in you head? What do these pigeons eat? Help me get in! - Why don't you let go? - What are you doing? I got the wrong entrance. I'm upside down! - We are falling. - Embrace me! Remove that town! Stop! The balloon! My balloon! - Help! - Every man for himself! Ah! You've ruined me! Dad, the fall of the Roman Empire was nothing compared to this. I can't stand you. You two are... - Your favorite sons. - No. Enough! Enough! I say "enough", you scoundrels! You ruined the greatest invention of Baron Tulicò! Ciccio! We are sons of two fathers! I will have you accused of stealing my face! I finally caught you, Babalone! You will be facing arms! What, General? Ask this imposter why he stole my balloon! What kind of a joke is this? I'll have you all shot! No! Not Dad! Get lost. I can't stand it anymore! I can't stand it! Shoot me, hang me, rip me apart, do whatever you want, but I am not your father. I am the bandit, Babalone! Margherita, you tell them. She doesn't want to say it, now. You imposter! Now I understand! I did not deceive. I am the Genius of Evil. - Dad, my daddy! - Sons! Fifì! My sons! Oh, God, I'm dying. I'm dying... Mom is dying. Maria Rosa! General! - What should I do? - A Redshirt knows what to do. Bandit Babalone, in the name of the Garibaldi army, - I declare you under arrest. - Don't exaggerate. The film is about to end. Let's think of a happy ending for bandit Babalone and Marquis Blind who has a dishonored daughter he has to marry off. - What do you mean? - I could marry your daughter, and pay off my past, present and future misdeeds. I don't mind that. What does Bellingeri say? Right now the lieutenant cannot answer. Why not? How is the patient? Dad, why don't you intervene? How is Mom? Tell us. - Well? - She is dying. Then I will leave. Baron! Your cynicism is revolting. In other circumstances, I'd have challenged you, but I won't now. I won't risk my life in a useless, dangerous duel. I am leaving. What are you doing? She wants to talk to me. - An interpreter is needed. - An interpreter? - You go. You look alike. - Yes, Mom. What is it? Mom says that the scoundrel must marry her on her death bed. If he doesn't, her ghost will persecute him forever. The poor dying woman, asks as a last wish, - to marry you. - I am engaged. I am betrothed to Marquise Blind. - I must sign the contract. - You will. You've my word. As soon as that poor woman breathes her last breath. - Dad! - Be silent! Even if I wanted to, I can't. There isn't a priest. You don't have a priest? He doesn't have a priest! I will marry you with a civil rite. - You are a soldier. - As general, my rank... As commander and chief, I can take on the functions of a civil State official! - Give me your hands. - Best wishes. Come on! Come on! - 1, 2, 3! This woman is yours. - What? I mean... I declare you husband and wife. - Cheers for the newlyweds! - Thank you. Before going, I will kiss the bride. I don't envy you. Goodbye, beautiful, goodbye. Baldigari is leaving. Children, come with me. Let's leave the newlyweds alone. - We'll leave you alone with Dad. - General, I don't thank you. Attention! Goodbye. Mommy... I want a little sister. What do you want? Goodbye, sons of the Leopard. Watch over the happiness of your parents. We would have liked to have you as a father, - and follow you in battles. - I know. But there are already many of us. Battalion, attention! From the first platoon on the left, forward, march! Ciccio, I've always liked watching army parade. - She stopped breathing! - Where are you doing? Excuse me, dear. I thought you were dead. You'd have liked that, but I've never felt better. Maybe the wedding did me good. - You fainted. - I pretended. - And your pale face? - Fake. - Your gasping? - I faked that, too. Then you deceived me! I should have imagined. You took advantage of my good intentions. You are... Watch out, Fifì! I am your wife and won't allow you to offend me. Dishonored, deceived and penniless! - Do you realize I've no money? - There is no need. Shall we live on air? You forget that for 20 years I was a clairvoyant. I earned enough to be able to live a serene life with my children. I didn't do it for money, but for the name. Fifì, you don't pay for children. You have your sons! What will I do? You? - You'll work, my dear. - Work? I am Fifì Tulicò, and I have a reputation, a family name to defend, - a leopard to support! - I took care of him. By the way, the dear little animal came to me in the hope of finding you. Having you here with me has made me hungry. You want to eat some meat? Here, love. I made it with my own hands. I'll fix you wonderful meals! A nice potato all for you! You won't regret having married me. Besides, I learned to cook in Bologna. I can make great ravioli! With meat sauce. - What do you say? - Good. What is it? Delicious. - You can't guess? - No. Think. Think for a minute. Pippo! - Pippo? - Yes. Pippo! You silly thing! Pippo! Pippo! - Here he is. - Pippo! You're alive! Embrace me! Did you like the joke? My Pippo. You scared me! Mom! Mom! - The ugly cat with spots! - Don't be afraid, children. Come to Mom, to Dad, - and to your little leopard. - He'll eat us. A Leopard doesn't eat his children. - Right, Maria Rosa? - Hear that? He's a vegetarian!
