A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery My dear Pepita, Tomorrow, as the sun breathes life to a new day, the life of Dr. Jose Rizal will end. He will be shot to death at Bagumbayan. Much as I hate, I will be there to bear witness to the crime that Spain is going to commit against our people. I will be there to commit to memory their crime. I will be there to shudder at man’s wickedness; to grieve and weep for our country. I want to make sure what transpires today will continue to persist in my mind up to my last dying breath so I can recall over and over again –-what happened on December 30, 1896. December 30 will always stay with me. Like a constant star with nothing to bear but a constant light with graces to spare "It’s inevitable," the old chameleon proclaimed to his noble companion His memory will be sullied and shamed By the unintelligible songs The song There There the children scurry along Beckoned by the lovely nymph Beckoned by the lovely nymph While the poet begged for mercy On the extreme the extreme the extreme torment he witnessed savage blows of a dirge he heard, on suffering! It echoes and is heard, the mad dog's howl The howl! The howl. The howl! The howl! The howls of a dog gone mad The despair of a forsaken land To the memories The memories Paulita... Rice cakes! Sweets! I’ll get some! I'll buy rice cakes, please. Hold the sugar and grated coconut- -gave me a stomach ache yesterday. - The grated coconut is fresh. - Must have been something else. Add one rice cake then, please. Dr. Jose Rizal will be put to death today. - Thanks. - Thank you, Sir. May you all die! Isagani! I'm not Isagani. That's not me! - Isagani! - Yes. Rice cake, brother. Still warm. I don't like rice cake. I'm not a whore! Good thing there's still one left here. Looks like you haven't eaten for a long while.. Friend. Friend! Please, eat! Thanks. Do you know what will happen in Bagumbayan today? February 17, 1872. What did you say? Have you read 'El Filibusterismo'? Yes, of course. I'm hiding a copy. It's written in the first page. February 17, 1872 Bagumbayan is in its first page. Do not forget Gomez, Burgos and Zamora. The one who offered will be the one being offered later. You see, my friend.. History repeats itself. Isagani... please, come with me. Let's go home. - Come! - No. Useless, just like this rice cake. What are you doing here? You're only wasting your time! Ready! Aim! Fire! Long live Spain! Traitor! Asshole! You deserve to die! You're finally dead, Dr. Jose Rizal! Asshole! Only you my soul worships, my beloved O purity incarnate, great beauty unmatched Exquisite perfume of an unblemished flower Gentle spring of joy and inspiration’s power Eden found, fount of happiness sublime The joy you bring can last me for a lifetime For your teasing glance and the sweetest of sweet smiles Buds of flowers gladly bloom for miles and miles and miles Blind trust in your mercy, somehow my heart abides A rope of hope that I cling to until this fear subsides You’re my life, my salvation, you will not let me down In this sea of uncertainty, you will not let me drown Most humble, most earnest, in the end I still beg you Grant a measure of your love to this supplicant so true Beggars are strangely grateful for pity... In a fashion Better than a toxic life, without soul and without passion. Such a lovely song. Thank you. It will stay with me wherever I go. I apologize for intruding so much into your life. No, you've never intruded. Time and circumstances are just not on our side. Give your love to someone else. Lucky is she whom you will love. You know it’s you, Pepita. Please, you have to go now. I beg you. We’re only making it more difficult. If I should perish in this revolution, know that I offer to you and to our country, each drop of blood that will flow from my body. Please, take care. I will always treasure your song. It’s all meaningless now, Maria. Goodbye, San Diego. Friends! I'd like to introduce to you the young poet, Ramona! Friends... my child, Ramona, had gone completely blind just last month. We're just poor. We're just begging money for her eye operation so she could see again. It's been two months now since... May we not forget what happened in Bagumbayan last December 30. The poem Ramona will be reciting is the poem Dr. Jose Rizal wrote the night before he was shot in Bagumbayan. Farewell, my adored Land, region of the sun caressed, Pearl of the Orient Sea, our Eden lost With gladness I give you my life, sad and repressed; And were it more brilliant, more fresh and at its best, I would still give it to you for your welfare at most. On the fields of battle, in the fury of fight, Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy, The place does not matter: cypress, laurel, lily white; Scaffold, open field, conflict or martyrdom's site, It is the same if asked by the home and country. I die as I see tints on the sky begin to show And at last announce the day, after a gloomy night; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow, Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so, And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light - Good morning, Ma'am. - Good morning to you as well. Good morning, Sir. - The poem you recited is beautiful. - It's Dr. Jose Rizal's work, Sir. I know. Where did you get a copy? From a gentleman named Isagani. She was set to be treated by Dr. Jose Rizal but- it didn't push through... Here, take this. Use this for her treatment. You can use the remaining for your future. You don't need to beg anymore. - Thank you very much for this, Sir! - Thank you. What's your name, Sir? My name is Crisostomo Ibarra. You are an angel, Sir. You are the angel, Ramona, thank you very much. Take care! - Thank you, Sir. - You may now see the world again. Thank you. Wait, stop. I know you... It's Sir Simoun! Mother, Father, I have to go Where I am off to, there’s a war, I know I will offer a little time and my life, too. But it’s all for freedom. Mother, Father, don’t fret and don’t worry The love that you gave me I'll forever find In other nurturing fathers and mothers In homes that they will offer. You will not be alone, while I am off and gone Sons, count a thousand, will march by one by one Just like your son, fighting for the Motherland. Warm greetings I sent, they will bring to you My comrades, my friends, they are your sons, too They will say with a smile: “Mother, Father, how are you?” Mother, Father, as I turn away to go I promise at the end we won't fail! The dawn of freedom that we dreamed of Will shine through at last. At last! You will not be alone, while I am off and gone Sons, count a thousand, will march by one by one Just like your son, fighting for the Motherland. Just like your son, fighting for the Motherland. Caesaria. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. - My money's not enough. - Just eat. What do you want to eat? Do you have slipmouth fish with tomatoes? We do! Here. That's enough. - You can sit down. - No, thanks. Letter from Basilio. Come inside! Come inside, Isagani. Take a seat. Sit down. Want some tea? This is nice. Really, really nice. This one's from Shanghai. Thanks. Drink. Nice? Yes, thanks. Wait. The medicines are all here. Thanks, Tubak. I have to go now. Thanks. Isagani! Tobacco, you want? It's from Ilocos. No, thanks. - Basilio. - Isagani. Thank you, my friend. How are you, my friend? I don’t know how to explain it to you. Bloody. It was bloody. I don't know how to describe them through words. It's hell. These medicines? These won't last a day with so many sick and wounded people. In the battle at Silang, the last few days, they set the town in fire. Children, old people, everyone butchered. Just like what happened at Nasugbu and Bulacan. Medical doctors like me are useless at these times. I'm losing hope. I know you, friend. You'll never lose hope, Basilio. I’ll be back, Isagani. Ask around for that bastard Simoun's whereabouts. Basilio... - Forget him. - Never, Isagani. He has plenty of accounts to settle –with our country, with me... with you! You must be forgetting what he did to you and Paulita! Paulita's wedding. I don't forget, my friend. Look at me. Am I a picture of a fool who forgets? Am I sorry for saving their lives? I played the hero but for what, Basilio? What kind of fool am I? The noble hero sacrificing for a woman who chose to marry another man. The brave hero saving the arrogant oppressors of his own race. And because I was a lovesick fool for Paulita, Spain continues to rule in this country. Think about that, my friend. Think. I am a hero to one woman to a woman who turned her back on me but, I am a traitor to my country. Ponder on that, Basilio. The Spanish Empire now continues to rule in Asia because of me. It's all because of me, Basilio! Forgive me, my friend. I can't take this. It weighs on my conscience. I can’t bear it. My soul is drowning. I can't... forgive myself, Basilio. Thanks for these medicines, Isagani. Be safe, my friend. You're the one who must be careful! Isagani, you have to put your life in order. How, Basilio? Tell me how? Son of a bitch, Isagani! You’re the most intelligent of our generation. You know what's the answer! That's it, you hear me? The country is burning. It is bathed in blood. What are you doing?! What happened to the poems you said would save the country? You’re meandering all over the place. You live in the streets. You don’t care. You’re useless! A poet indeed! Go drown yourself in your worthless verses! As promised, the much-delayed reward... for your help in the fall of Silang. Time for goodbyes. We’re meeting for the last time. Thank you very much, Caesaria Belarmino. Spain owes you plenty. First time you thanked me this way. The times we’re in are different. Things happen too fast. We have no control on what transpires. Best to say what one needs to say, quickly. Where are you going? To Maragondon. To Naic. To Imus. To Cavite? You’re going back there? What for? I want to see Gregoria de Jesus. Are you crazy? You want to go back to the nest of scampering mice? Cavite is about to fall. Any minute now, Aguinaldo and his men will be climbing up the mountains of Montalban, allegedly to hide in the cave of Bernardo Carpio. They are going to ask for help from Bernardo Carpio, the supposed savior of your race. I feel so sorry for what I’ve done. You did the right thing, Caesaria. What you did at Silang was horrible. What makes it right to kill children, women, and old people? Difficult to accept, but these things were dictated by circumstances and the times we live in. These are turbulent times. Quite often, violence spares no one. Force against force, Caesaria. All part of the history of man. Thank you very much, Caesaria Belarmino. For everything. From the heart. No words will suffice. He's dead. We rest here! Hold my heart in your hands, feel my love oh so deep Burn with pain and with passion, hear my heart gently weep In a world full of sorrow, marked by struggle and strife You’re my beacon, my north star, the light of my life Still humble, still earnest, in the end I still will beg you Grant a measure of your love to this supplicant so true Even pity is a choice, in a hopeful beggar’s fashion Better that, than toxic life, without hope and without passion. What are you thinking of? Say something, Andres. - What time do we leave tomorrow? - We leave at dawn. Talk to Gregoria. Make her leave. - You got to leave. - He needs care. - Orders, Ma’am! - He’s burning with fever. Lie down, Procopio. Good evening, Ma'am Hule. Good evening to you as well. Gregoria. Thank you very much. Where's Andres? He's over there. They don't want me near him. Mr. Bonzon! Good evening, Miss Hule. There’s a quack doctor at Baryo Manggahan. Can we bring Andres there now? He is not looking good at all. I beg you. Are you deaf?! How difficult is it to give treatment to Mister Andres?! Now what? Are you deaf?! Listen, Miss Hule Can you just shut up? Else you'll be sorry. Comrade Procopio, Comrade Procopio... Oryang, can I have the blanket? Procopio’s feverish. Gregoria, please, eat. Why did you lock Andres and Procopio up in the toilet? They might attempt to escape. Escape? How can they escape? Andres can hardly stand. He’s cold and shivering with fever. At least give him a blanket, even an old sack. He's naked! His wounds are likely to be infected in that foul toilet. Please. I'm begging you. Where do you think you're going? - Can I stay with them at the toilet? - No, Ma'am. - Andres has a fever and his wounds are festering. Please. - Orders. Colonel Agapito Bonzon, I am asking you... Let us not have a repeat of the incident at Limbon. - What did we do in Limbon? - Colonel Agapito Bonzon, you defiled Gregoria de Jesus. And before your attack on Andres Bonifacio, you violated women in a nearby village. Is this the conduct of this revolution? - To dishonor women? - You watch your mouth, Artemio. I call it as I see it. It is disgraceful. Gregoria... Don't worry. It won’t happen again. We’ll get to Naic. Why, Artemio? Why did it all come to this? Why? What wrong have we done? What was Andres Bonifacio’s crime? What will happen to him in Naic? What will happen to us? - Stop! Where are you going? - To Tagaytay. - You're not allowed to go there. - And why not? It's part of the war zone. - By the Katipunan? - Ah, Katipunan! - Move over now. We're Quiroga's ladies. - What's your business in Tagaytay? We'll buy sticky black rice and the special sorghum grain. There's been shortage of goodies on the tables of the Ladies and Gentlemen. Doña Victorina is losing her appetite because of this. There's no goat milk left also for the friars. They're losing their drives to preach, to bless. They're losing their 'appetite'? There's no more Batangas coffee left plus Intramuros is getting sleepy as well as Binondo, the teachers are sleeping, theaters are closing and Philosopher Tasio is missing. So you see, there is this need for the sack of fine brewed coffee. So move over now before business gets ruined. The Captain General will have a word with you if he finds out you prevented Quiroga's ladies from going. Move. I'll take you home tonight. Let's meet at Escolta. Profit first! Excuse me, ladies! Fifty years old, from the German consulate! Quiroga sends his greetings, Sir Simoun. How is he? He is still thinking of the nine thousand pesos that he paid for that bracelet of yours. The task that you gave us is so difficult. We shall die if someone finds out about it. But Quiroga is worried. We, Chinese people, are really your friends. I need you. Even for just this final moment. We are true friends to those who are honest. You will not die yet, Sir Simoun. Your silver extends your life. You can do a lot with it. Is this strong? Those who are firm becomes weak, will be uprooted. From the wildest roots of the mountain logs in Qinghai. It's difficult to find. Hard to obtain. There are those who died searching for it. Good. That’s why it's expensive. Thank you. To whom is the poison for? For the hardest person, Sir Simoun? For the hardest, hardest, hardest? Apologies, my friend. This may be the last time we're seeing each other. I may still be able to help facilitate your escape but it will be perilous for me. But- since you are my friend, I'm here. Now, what can I do for you, Sir Simoun? Thank you. I just need to work on some commitments so I need a little time. I won’t bother you. You can have your well-deserved siesta now. Don't be silly. There’s no siesta in times of disarray, in times of revolution. But Spain is winning! You just got rid of your number one Indio enemy. Dr. Jose Rizal is finally dead. What an unparalleled victory for Spain, right? You’ve silenced the greatest mind of the Malay race. - What an achievement! - You know it is not like that. His death... brought more complications. Come on. You know that the tumult is going down. It is only a matter of time. After your glorious victory in Silang, the Katipunan revolution is practically done! - Congratulations, my friend! - Ah, yes. The battle of Silang. It could have been the greatest battle of the Tagalogs but instead, it became our sweetest triumph. Sometimes, things work in mysterious ways. February 19 was a sweet day. Deliverance came like manna from heaven. We were losing. We were desperate. The fortifications of the Katipunan were quite formidable. Then- my sweet Caesaria delivered us. Unbelievable. Caesaria? Yes. Caesaria Belarmino. Without her, the battle of Silang's victory would not have been possible. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes. You know I don't lie. Caesaria. She was from Silang. She showed us the secret passage for the proverbial Trojan horse to go through the supposedly formidable fortifications of the Katipunan. We didn't know it was so easy. That there was a secret backway in the mountains to Silang. She showed it to the great General Jose Lachambre. Our three days of hell turned into a fiesta! I couldn't thank her enough. Silang was a horrifying massacre. Lachambre burned Silang! The violence and cruelty were unheard of. It may even be worse than the Bulacan and Nasugbu massacres. Mothers, children, even old people were not spared. There were rapes! Why did you allow that? I'm amazed that you asked that. You were one of the roots of this cataclysm. Isn't that what you were asking for? You want destruction, right? You want to burn the whole country, right? You want to tear it down to pieces so that the masses will rise. Well- Rejoice now! It’s happening. Listen. Simoun. We have been friends since our day in Cuba. - May I make a suggestion? - Yes, Cuba. Rubbing elbows with those scheming Americanos. Their lies. Yes, I remember. It's been a long time now. Don’t you want to go back there? Our friend, General Valeriano Weyler is now top honcho. - He can take care of you. - No. My friend, Weyler is an evil. I’ve heard about his reconcentration camps there. Thousands have died of hunger and barbarism. Pure evil! He’s a butcher! You know what he did here, right? His campaign against the Moros? And what he did two years ago before he left. He orchestrated the ruin of the Rizal family. He destroyed the Rizal family. And he enriched himself. He came to these shores a poor man. - And a millionaire when he left. - For now... Cuba is your best refuge. - And if things get worse, there’s always America. - No. - You're a stubborn man. - You can leave me alone. I can't do that. I owe you. - Maybe even for my life. - Yes. You owe me. But I am not asking you to pay. - You stay out of trouble. - Ah, Simoun. - You know I am a man of gratitude. - And I am a man of consequence. The whole of Spain is earnestly after your head. We must decide. Move. Fast. If they find out I’m still dealing with you, I’ll be in prison. And I will be stripped of all my power. Yes... Power. Can I say you earnestly worked for it? - It is your habitat. Am I right? - Yes. I accept that. And I won't deny it. Life is good and I want to maintain it that way. Well, what about you, Simoun? Don't you covet power? You used money to forment hatred. You used influence to exact revenge. You used to be one of the best players of the game, what happened to you? The consequence of one mistake. I'm on the run. But you still don't really know me, my friend. I do know you. Let's relax. So, do you have any plans? You can tell me. If you don't mind. Maybe there's still something I can do. Nothing really. I leave it to fate now. You know, I returned to these shores thinking I can manipulate things but the reverse happened. No matter what I do, I’ve come to accept the realization that my life’s storyline is just like that: playing with fate. So I’ll just wait for the next chapter to unfold and flow with it. Yes, there are things that still need to be done but I don’t really know. It makes me sad. You feel sad, my friend? But did you feel sad when my beloved Maria Clara died? - Did you feel sad when Dr. Jose Rizal... - I know what you went through. The death of Dr. Jose Rizal was a necessary evil. He asked for it. It was like- something written meant to be fulfilled and so- it shall come. It was nothing but an application. Talk about a principle of consequence. That sounds like a poetic rationalization from Satan, my friend. Satan acknowledges his deeds. He believes in his lies. The empire must be salvaged. The logic is simple. You never understood the evolution of peoples’ struggles, you conquestadores from the West. What more is there to understand? You know- I know, you and your fellow Spaniards are belittling the Katipunan revolt. - Or the other pocket revolts in these islands. - Why do you say that? I can sense it in every Spaniard's demeanor here. I do believe you’re tormented by fear but you maintain a posture of dominance. And I admire that dominance! It is a kind of stubbornness really. That very Western mien—the dominant eye attitude. But I assure you, Captain General: that the lessons yielded by the natives are immense. Surely, there shall be an overt debacle, because of the hasty way it is mounted, and then, the infighting and the immaturity that is happening right now. But the ten million Malay inhabitants you call "Indios" in this archipelago, my friend, will massively learn from this. You just do the math, my friend. For the three hundred years you've stayed has now turned into a conflagration that even you couldn’t stop any longer. What will happen to the Spanish in these shores, my friend? What? We shall endure. You want to measure endurance? I tell you. The Indios will not take three hundred more years. No. These shores are ruled by myths, legends, fantastic stories, by lies. That indictment is acceptable. But the myth of the invincible Spaniard will soon be gone, too. In an instant, you’ll just be a flicker in the eye. Well, well, well, well... Let’s stop it. Friends should not be attacking each other this way. Whatever happens, I would like to thank you. You have my respect and my admiration. You're a unique man and I've learned many lessons from you. For whatever shortcomings, I apologize. Be very careful. Inasmuch as you don't want my help, as an ultimate act to our friendship, I can only warn you. They want your head very, very bad. Be very careful. I can only hope the gods will will that our destinies cross paths again someday. Where could be, my friend? The River Styx, perhaps. It is hot in there. Am I right? You know? You know what’s unique with this friendship? What, my friend? We get so good with the opium. Oh yes, oh yes. We know the sweet spot. After the third hit, right? And- We speak tolerable English. Ah, yes. Very, very, very, very dainty English. I’m sorry, my friend. You can't come to the celebration. We both know I’m no longer part of the status quo. Farewell, my friend. Goodbye, Captain General. Gregoria, you're now free. Where did they take them? Have you seen them? Have you seen Andres? Procopio? The soldiers? Pitiful. Have you seen Andres or Procopio? The soldiers took them, right? Have you seen them? Oryang. Sir Karyo! Have you seen Andres? Or even Procopio? With the soldiers? Where did they take them? That way. Be strong, wife of Andres. The unbelievable cruelty of the Tagalogs during the last few days... Tagalogs wreaking havoc on fellow Tagalogs— Is unparalleled. These are judgement times inhabited by disputes and greed. It is the verdict in a climate of mistrust. These are cursed times. Thank you, Sir. Cursed. Water! Let's go! Lazaro. We left them with a colonel in the mountains. - What did you do with them? - They're at the mountain. Ernesto! Why do you have their clothes, sheets, and medicines? He asked me to give them to you. I was just doing him a favor. Where is he, Lazaro? At Mount Buntis. You killed him, didn't you? How much will you get from Captain Emilio Aguinaldo- Lazaro Makapagal?! Let's go! Gregoria de Jesus, good afternoon. My name is Caesaria Belarmino. Aling Hule... Oryang... Let's look for Andres. Yes. It's Caesaria, Ma'am. Let's go come inside. - Karyo! Come here with us. - I'll just remain here. Damn. When will I be the parish priest of Quiapo? All those kind are hearing mass in Quiapo! Oh, Father. - It’s like witnessing a miracle, right, Father? - And what miracle is that? Well, if that mysterious man did not save us during the wedding of Paulita Gomez and Juanito, - it would have been all over for all of us! - That man was an angel. Heaven sent him to save us, and Spain. God knows who to save and who to punish. Any news as to who that man is? Looks like you’re losing your touch, Mr. Ben Zayb? You—who knows everything. The greatest journalist of Spain in Las Islas de Filipinas. I’ll find out soon enough. I’ll get to identify him. We just have to capture that jeweler Simoun. I am quite sure he knows that person. We're closing in on him. It’s all over for that arrogant businessman. That half-baked American. That raw Portuguese. That unripe Indian. What a big miracle would be if he’s also captured and executed at Bagumbayan just like that son of a bitch Jose Rizal. Watch your mouth, Father. Christ will forgive me if all the blasphemy is intended for that man. Son of a bitch that Dr. Jose Rizal! And our victory at Silang, Cavite was a major miracle, right? They’re done for. Miracle of the mistress, Father. Yes. The Waterloo of the Katipunan. That son of a bitch Katipunan. Did she went through you, Father? Didn't she? The miracle of the mistress? No, no, no! And confessed? And right after recited The Joyful Mystery? Or, maybe the Sorrowful Mystery? You are so naughty, Ben Zayb. So naughty. You are much naughtier, Father Camorra. I know you. How are you doing, Captain General? Fine, as always. I thought I would not make it to your celebration. - I did not receive an invitation. - Begging your pardon, Sir. Must have been delayed. So much to do. An ongoing filibuster... We've got to be vigilant. I’m accustomed to excuses. No problem. Greetings! And what are we celebrating here? Only one of countless celebrations for his death. - Aah, Dr. Jose Rizal. - And the fall of the Katipunan, what they call the filibuster of the Tagalogs. According to our spy... I am a good spy. Am I not, Captain General? The leaders of the Katipunan have devoured each other. The latest news is that- Aguinaldo has ordered the capture of Bonifacio and his men. And he was sentenced to death. In a few days, he will be executed. Imagine, they’re all killing each other. What idiots! And this Pedro Paterno, who thinks he’s a big man, is negotiating with us. What negotiation? He says he bears a message from Aguinaldo’s group. That for the right price, they can stop the insurrection. Aguinaldo is offering to sell the revolution? For now, we look at it this way: they are laying their cards at the market. What is the difference? I don’t know. But what I see is aces for Spain. What I see is treason. What I see is cowardice. It is common to our culture. Normal for Filipinos? Normal for Spaniards, too. Normal for humans. Beautiful weave, yes? Finely made. Sophisticated. Great weave, great weaver. Confiscated from the dead in Bulacan. Stained by the blood of what must have been a beautiful Malay woman. Worn by members of the Colorum cult. Sequestered the dress, had it washed, soaked in lime juice, and dipped in Chinese starch. Dried thoroughly under the sun, sprinkled with spring wáter and pressed with a coconut charcoal-heated iron. That accounts for the lovely smell. Should fetch quite a price in Madrid and Barcelona. Yes. My wife gains quite a profit from stuff like this. Don’t the ghosts ever haunt you? They say the soul of the departed rarely ventures too far from what they own. I am not like the natives who have too many superstitions and fears. Don’t worry, I have no interest in asking you for this. I own more than a few. But I have plenty of these. Wouldn’t you like one? No, no, no, Sir. I would not like to see a fellow ghost. It doesn’t suit me. It depends on how it’s worn. And who’s wearing it. Always. Of course, it’s not for me. Not for someone like me. There’s a favor I’d like to ask. We have to talk. What? Another important mission. A very important mission. Tell me. Capture Bernardo Carpio. He’s the last major obstacle to Spain. The hero of the Colorums. The champion of the Tagalogs. This plan, your plan. What’s in it for me? I know that you have made several attempts before but Bernardo Carpio is elusive. Once we hold Bernardo Carpio captive, the revolution of the Filipinos will totally lose its strength. I can handle Bernardo Carpio. I know his weakness. I know the deficiencies of his race. And that’s why I’m talking to you, my Enchanted Friend. And what is the reward this time? You will be among the most powerful beings on these islands. You will keep alive the myths, and legends, and lies in the consciousness of the Indios. I like that. Yes, yes, yes. We’ve been at it for a long time. But what about Simoun? But what about Simoun? Ah, Simoun. What a waste. Everyone calls him a traitor. He’s still dangerous. There’s just too much hatred in his heart. He’s a lost soul. Would you like me to include Simoun in our plan? Just let him be. And are you saying this because he’s a friend? The whole world is after his head. Let’s not waste our time. But he’s still enormously wealthy. He can easily regain his power, if he chooses to. It is his wealth that the others are after. Excellent. This is really fine grade. From the royal family of China. A gift from the French Embassy in exchange for a permit from me allowing their favorite theater company to perform here. What are they performing? Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand. They’re bringing here the great actor-director Benoit Constant Coquelin. He’s all the rage in Paris, as well as the play that was performed at the Theatre de la Porte Saint Martin. Are they aware of the war going on here? Yes. And they also know the impact of their own revolution on the rebellion of the Katipunan. Very interesting! Simoun’s spirit has weakened. He has lost the devil in his soul. And you, Captain-General, do you still possess the demon? And you, Tikbalang, are you the demon? All right. What is our plan for Bernardo Carpio? It goes like this: We will prepare a banquet more elaborate than this. A feast in a secret place, pretend it’s exclusively for the distinguished. He will be invited. It is important that he does not suspect that we planned the banquet. You take care of that. The priests and the King of Spain want him chained up forever inside a hidden cave up in the mountains. For as long as the Indios can’t catch a glimpse of him, we will always rule over these islands. We will always rule over these islands. I will get ready for him. His extraordinary strength is legendary. As great as his myth in the minds of the Tagalogs. Pardon, Sir. The show is about to begin. They’re just waiting for you. Tonight... we shall watch the Cinematographé. The Cinematographé? The new invention in photography from France. An amazing invention. And why is it amazing? Well... I am not a critic. But when I first experienced it, it seemed as if I saw an alternative world. Another world. Very interesting. Let's go, my friend. Tonight, we will witness the Cinematographé from Paris. The work of Auguste and Louis Lumiere, visionary brothers in photography. Of course, I was in Paris when it was first shown last December 28, 1895. In other words, I am the first man from Las Islas de Filipinas to ever watch this show. I was the special guest of the Lumiere brothers to the first showing at the Salon du Grand Café in Paris. Well- Tonight, I would like to share this exceptional experience with you. But of course, I will have to confess that I got scared when I first watched this show. Many who were there scampered away. Thankfully, there was a beautiful Italian lady from the Lido Island who was with me when I watched, and my fear ended up with you know what. Anyway... Now that you know, what you will watch is only an illusion of Cinematographé. So, don’t be frightened, and don’t run away. Furthermore, now that Dr. Jose Rizal is dead, let us celebrate. Now that the Katipunan is about to fall, Spain has nothing to fear. Nothing to run away from. Spain will remain in Las Islas de Filipinas. Yes, yes. Andres Bonifacio is a puny enemy. Just like Rizal, he will die. He will soon be executed under the orders of Aguinaldo. That’s the latest news. They will be killing off each other. And this Bernardo Carpio, the one they hail as their hero, is but a tiny enemy. They are about to be obliterated. And, as for Simoun? Ah, he will soon be nothing more than a memory. - So gentlemen? Long live Spain. - Long live Spain! Good day to you, my friend! Have you seen soldiers pass by? They have prisoners with them. No. Thank you. You really haven't seen anyone? No. I didn't see anyone. Let's go, Oryang. Thank you, Sir. Let's stay here for a while. Let's spend the night here. Sir Karyo... Are you okay? Leave me alone. You haven't slept yet. I can't sleep. Are you ready for whatever will we find out? When I decided to join him I was ready even then. I was all of 18 years old when I disobeyed my father, Aling Hule. I turned my back on a peaceful life with my father and my siblings in exchange for the restlessness of a mad man whose consuming passion is to free his country. Four years. On our second year, our only son's life was sacrificed. Four years. I spent four years preparing for a time like this. Again and again he would tell me that he will very likely die in this revolution. If that time has come, I find it heartbreaking that the executioners are our fellow Tagalogs. Not the Spanish invaders. It frightens me, Aling Hule. Me, too, Oryang. My mind is filled with horrible visions of what could happen. Good day to you, Sir. Good morning. What's good in the morning? Think carefully before you speak. Water? Water from the clearest and coolest spring. You all look tired. Drink. There's the dipper. You're free to drink anytime you wish. Have you seen any Tagalog soldiers pass this way? Not sure. Sometimes they pass by. Why? - No news then if any soldiers have arrived? - None. Is this Mount Buntis? Mount Tala and Mount Buntis. Twin Mountains. Are you looking for someone? Day after yesterday, my husband Andres Bonifacio was brought here by Tagalog soldiers, led by Lazaro Makapagal. So, you are Gregoria de Jesus? Good to see you once more. I saw you once before. I did not get a closer look at your nose and your eyes because I was way up on a tree. And where did this happen, Sir? At Balara. It was a night with a full moon. You did not notice me but I noticed you. You crossed the river headed for Barangka, Marikina. Wait there. I'll get you some betel nut. Here are some betel nuts. And leaves. - Chew some. - Thanks. Will the Tagalog's revolution camp here? Or will this be their hiding place? This place is perfect for a fortress. The enemy will have great difficulty. The encantos will play with them. We will misguide them. They will get tired and they will lose strength. You look like you’ve been travelling for some time. You can rest here. I may have little to offer. But we can share. Don’t bother. We have to go. Up to you. Come back, if you like, and we can have a feast. Soup from mountain mushrooms is delicious. Served with grilled catfish and mudfish. Very recently, we had a secret banquet here. A feast for the great ones. And we captured one! We managed to chain-up someone, very well-known. A hero. Who did you catch? Should I tell them? He says you already know who. We have to go. We're going. Up to you. I heard gunshots. Gunshots? Where? When? Several days ago. I am not so sure because I was resting then. I believe it was far from here. You don’t recall what direction the gunshots came from? In a place where there are two mountains, the noise becomes echoes, shattering, bouncing in every direction. It is much easier to determine the source of a whisper. From where did the gunshots come? I already told you, I am not sure. Let’s all try to be quiet. There might be a chance we could hear it? There’s a deep rumbling sound. I don’t know where it’s coming from. Let's go. There's an earthquake! Didn't you feel it? There were echoes! Didn't you hear them? There were screamings! Didn't you hear them?! Didn't you hear them?! Gregoria de Jesus! Wait! This- is the blood of the Tikbalang. We fought for thirteen days. Bloody. I emerged victorious. A talisman for a warrior. My offering for the Supremo. Give it to him to make him invincible to the bullets and swords of the enemy! And any illness is instantly healed! I'll give it to him. How does one use it? The fairies shall whisper the way. Does anyone else live around here? On the other side, farmers-—husband and wife. Quite often, there are visitors. Some are hiding in the nooks and crannies. Some are gossipy types like you. And so, there are baseless opinions spreading around. And you, who are you living with? Kapre, Tikbalang, tiyanak, dwarves, and modest fairies, who else? There is a hidden cave where Bernardo Carpio is imprisoned. I am here to look for that cave so I can release him from where he is pinned by two colliding rocks. He alone! Only he can free this country. Not your revolution. You lie! Bernardo Carpio's cave is at San Mateo and Montalban. Hearsay. Rumors. Baseless opinions whispered by those unwilling to listen. No one can validate. I know him. I know Bernardo Carpio. Not long ago, we fought, and I vanquished him. And who might you be, Sir, that you were able to conquer Bernardo Carpio? Nobody can vanquish Bernardo Carpio. He was fooled by a traitorous enchanted being. An Encanto who allowed himself to be used by the beastly Spaniards! Hmmm, so you know of that myth? Everyone knows that story! And that’s the truth! Not a myth! And did you know, as well, that Caneo is here? A leader of the Colorum? That they are looking for Bernardo Carpio? It is said that they will free Bernardo Carpio so that he can save the country. Let's go, Gregoria. This is the blood of the Tikbalang the great Bernardo Carpio drinks! It is the secret of Bernardo Carpio’s strength! But I hold the blood! Bernardo Carpio has no more power! No more! A joyful welcome on your return! Good day to you, my friend. Come! Nice day, isn't it? Humid. It seems like we’re lost. It’s baffling that we’re back here again. As often said, the lost will circle back and will return. And they'd ask: “Where?” You don't seem to be crazy? We are not lost. We're looking for someone. We just happen to pass by again. At the beginning? May we have a drink, old friend? The earthen jar is empty. Spring water's been muddy. It's been raining the past days. I got betel nuts! Plenty of them! Your thirst will soon be quenched. Your senses will be awakened! Your mind will wander! Your souls will be cradled. You'll reach places. Not in hell, mind you! Not even in heaven! Not even in purgatory. But... in forgetting. Yours is a beautiful story, Karyo. Sad. Are you listening? Can you hear me? Ah, I am getting deaf. I heard every verse. Both the vague and the clear ones. I am worthless. And why, may I ask? - Don't you know I kept pleading to Mariano Alvarez? - What are you saying? - The great teacher, Don Mariano Alvarez of Magdiwang. - I hate him! I wanted to join the revolution but he didn't want me to. He doesn't want me around. Says I have a contagious lung disease and the soldiers might get it from me. I think he's right, Karyo. I merely wanted to help.. - Want to have worth. - It's all my fault. You're full of microbes, Karyo. -Caesaria, I don't understand you. I can't hear you. What? -It's all my fault. We're all wiped out. There were very few of us from Santo Kristo area who survived. All gone! Children, elders, women, men... The microbes ate our lungs. Gone. All the children. Why, there were few of us who survived. Check your reflection at the crystal spring. - No way you can escape the microbes. - That's not true! - The microbes are eating you! - That's not true! - I can't hear you. - You're full of microbes. There's no escaping the microbes! What are you saying Caesaria? I can't hear you! Oryang! Oryang. Oryang? Why? Is that Andres'? This looked old. Must have been here a long time. Let's go on. What kind of woman are you, Caesaria? Are you mocking me? Mocking? Or not. Questions have varied meanings. It's how you accept and understand my question, really. I can make an empire fall. And burn a town. Very good. Very good. You're a woman of the highest breed, Caesaria. You're like Cleopatra. You're also like Helen. High breed. Don't mock me with your comparisons with their kind. I know I was a victim of time and circumstance. I'm just getting back at them. I may have hurt a lot of people but I can't do anything about it. It's done. If I could just turn back time. You can't turn back time. You know that. But people forget. Is anyone spared from the cruelty of man? What do you mean? I just felt that... I was used to fulfill some bad fate and a dark plot. I felt like I was chosen for it. I can't accept that. In life, we all are mediums. All of us have cruelty within. All of us have darkness within, Caesaria. We're just the same. But don't fret. Maybe, given another chance, in a different time, you will be hailed in a pedestal. In a pedestal of great women. Leave me alone. Leave. Oh well. Goodbye, Caesaria Belarmino. The great woman. Caesaria? Why? One bad dream. It's just a dream. We can take some rest there. Leave me alone. Karyo- Eat this. How about Oryang? If we find a house along the way, you should stay behind, Karyo. You need to rest. We’ll come back for you. Don't mind me. Your condition might get worse! I need this. I need something to do! Sir Karyo, please don't be insistent. Don't make me your problem! We've already talked about this, right? I need to be moving. Don't mind me. - Your condition might worsen. - Good, then! End of misery. Good morning, Karyo. Humid, isn't it? Strange, it's May now and it should be raining. How's your condition, Karyo? My limited knowledge springs from extreme poverty and lack of opportunities. Even so, the root of this cataclysm is very clear to me. It's all clear to me. I agree. The depth of one's understanding in life is not measured by his status and not even by his educational attainment. In other words, there is no class. But at these times, there is this 'ruling class' and the oppressed class. There, you got the point. So now, how do you dissect its fruit? It will be complicated. The recollecting alone, then the patching, and then the weaving process especially in a setting which seems to end up in hopelessness. What I know is, time is running. The universe is rotating. Fate is not in anyone's control in an instant, you lose grip. Like me. Strength has turned its back on me. And now it keeps on turning in my dying world as I look for remedy when there's no remedy for it. Looking for remedy when there's no remedy for it. Don't you feel sorry for yourself, Karyo? - I mean, in your hopelessness. - And why not? I'm just human! Of course, I'm looking for remedy for my sickness. I'm seeking answers for my questions. What if you find no answer? Sooner or later, there will be answers. Who knows? Who do you think holds the key to the truth? What is truth by the way? I don't know. This forest is very thick. The forest of life is hard to fathom. Oh well. I pity you, Karyo. Don't! I never asked for anyone's pity! Good, then! You know, in my opinion your soul is lost. That, I suppose, is the one you should be looking for. Off I go then. I've lots to do. Mother, here's our food. - Put it here, son. I'll just call your brother. - Yes, Mother. - Did your father, Jose, go fishing? - Yes, Mother. I wish he didn't. There's a storm coming. Francisco! Francisco, come over. Let's eat. Don't hesitate to eat. There's plenty. Thanks. Where are you from, Caesaria? I’m from Silang. Where were you during the battle last February 27? I was there. I saw it. What I remember is that- there were plenty of dead people. Children, old folks. Raped women. Houses burnt. This kind of tragedy repeats in our history. Be brave. Yes, hard to say but we must not leave room for fear this time. Last year, on October 31 in our town of Nasugbu, Batangas, during a gunbattle between the Spaniards, the Constabulary and the Katipuneros, we hid inside the church. Women, elderly, and children. I had my two young sons with me, and because Katipuneros lack weapons and men, they were defeated. The Spaniards and the Constabulary then raided the church, shooting and slashing without mercy. Dragging away the women and raping them. Killing anyone who dared to put up a fight. My two sons died. I saw it all. I saw how my children fought. October 31, 1896 in our town of Nasugbu; the blood of my children flowed. My sons... my sons... Who are those guys in white? Their moves are creepy and scary. - Just like ghosts. - I agree. Those are the religious type. They're maybe from Bulacan, Kakarong. Or in San Rafael! They might also be Maliksi's men from Banahaw. Anybody home? No one's home maybe. Hello? Good day to you! Hello? What do you want? May we have a drink? Come in. Good morning... - Good morning. - There's the water jar. Thanks. Thank you, Ma'am. We’ve been travelling from Maragondon since yesterday, Ma'am. Will you allow us to rest here for a while? My name is Gregoria. And I am Juliana, Hule. I am Caesaria. Take a seat. Karyo, Ma’am. It’s so comfortable here. Did you see any Tagalog soldiers pass this way yesterday? Did you see them? Why, Ma'am? They took Jose. Jose? My husband. They took him yesterday? They passed by. With captives all tied up. He hasn't returned yet. Were they Guardia Civil? Constabulary? Katipuneros? Matanglawin, perhaps? Were there only two captives? I don’t know. I didn’t peep. I was scared. You can stay here for a while. Thank you, Ma'am... Thank you. Karyo. Caesaria. Aling Hule. Let's eat. Thanks. More than hour after they left, I heard some gunshots. The gunshots came from what direction? I can’t tell. It echoed so much. And the wind was strong that afternoon. We get a lot of rain here. Did the gunshots last long? - Fairly short. - You did not recognize the captives? And who are they? I wish Jose would come home. I’m sure he knows what happened. It's almost dusk. It's rainy as well. You can spend the night here. Thank you very much. Eat some more. Hello? Hello? Rosario. Good evening. I heard, they're here. Gregoria de Jesus' group. They’re all in deep sleep. Sir Karyo. Aling Hule. Gregoria. Look who we have here.. Caesaria Belarmino! Caesaria of Silang. Boiled bananas. You can share it. Thanks for this. I'll borrow this candle. It's dark. This night will be very long. That sleep had been so long. It's like we've slept for hundreds of years. Rosario... Please, look after Sir Karyo for the meanwhile. - Good morning, Master Quiroga! - Good morning! When are you going to pay me? Do we have sales today? Have you seen Isagani? Basilio! Isagani! My apologies. Got stuck on a deal. I'm the one giving you a hand- and you made me wait. How’s that for a loyal friend? - I’ve been waiting for four hours. - I shouldn't be explaining, really. We shouldn't really be arguing! What’s a lifetime of waiting between good friends? Have you eaten? Why won’t you eat? Andres Bonifacio is dead. What? Don't play jokes on me. Not a joke at all. I heard from Emilio Jacinto himself. Emilio Aguinaldo ordered the execution. Son of a bitch! How many are these? Twenty one Remingtons. Seven pistols. The bullets are in there. We’ll have one each. Tubak, two men will come to pick up these weapons by sunrise. One of them has a large scar on his cheek. The men belong to the group of Emilio Jacinto and Macario Sakay. Thank you. Isagani... Here you go. Your favorites. Dried fish from Estancia and the best vinegar from Ilocos. Thanks. Thanks, Basilio. Emilio Jacinto is now in Laguna. Artemio Ricarte and Macario Sakay are now in Central Luzon. Many have abandoned the revolution because of the execution. Gregoria de Jesus is said to be on Mount Buntis at Maragondon, searching for the body of Bonifacio. Basilio... I'm asking you once again. Give up your plan. It’s too dangerous. Isagani... Monsters like him don’t deserve to live. Why not let the Spaniards and the Guardia Civil take care of that for you? Or his other enemies! Basilio, he has so many enemies his death is simply a matter of time. I want the pleasure of ending his life. That’s all. I just hope no one beats me to it. Maybe, you’re making a wrong decision. How could it be wrong to kill a devil like Simoun, Isagani? Why would it be wrong to exterminate one of the roots of confusion and poison in our country? We’ve already had numerous discussions about him. True! Yes. And on numerous occasions we’ve had discourse with him. He was exceptional. Brilliant, like you, Isagani. I still have not figured out what kind of man he is and his mind-set. But I believe - he’s a good man. - Nah. That's where we differ, Isagani. I know him and he has a very grim perspective. He’s a monster. But you know that the father of Juli is a friend of Simoun. Don’t drag the name of Juli into this discussion. I’m sorry, my friend. I already know where the bastard is hiding. It’s entirely up to you if you will help me or not. No pressure. I won't take it against you if you say no. Basilio... stop! Think about it, please. You don't have to go with me! Go home! Basilio! - Basilio, don't! - Go home! Basilio. Isagani. The noble youth! The hope of our pitiful country. Basilio! Basilio! Stop it! I said stop! I told you to stop! Basilio... Basilio. Take that baggage. Bring it with you. It can be of great help. What are you waiting for? Time to finish me off. - Basilio, enough! - Don't dare! So, the healer has learned to kill. Basilio, stop! Leave him there. He will soon run out of blood. I want him to bleed to death. I will stay. What? With that gunshot, the Guardia Civil could be here any minute. Let’s go! I won't go with you. - Let's go! - I said I won't go with you, Basilio! I don’t know what you're thinking. It’s up to you. But, save yourself! I’m off to Laguna. To Emilio Jacinto. Please follow! Take the baggage with you, Basilio. Basilio... the money that Elias buried under the balete tree, dig it up. Save yourself. Leave now, Isagani. Move! Leave! What are you waiting for? Leave! Hang on! Take me to your uncle, Padre Florentino, while there’s still time. Take the baggage. We can't go straight at the sea. The waves are strong. Let's not waste time. Let's go. It's risky, Sir. My boat can't make it. Let's stay here for a while, Sir Simoun. Where are we now, Isagani? Up a river, Sir Simoun. Heading into a thick forest. - Did the bleeding stop? - A little. It has quite stopped. How are you feeling now? Bad, Isagani. We have to get to your uncle. Here's the thing, Sir. This will be a long journey. I hope we make it. Wait, Sir. Isagani. Let's spend the night here. Rosario, I hear some noise. You hear it too? What is it, Gregoria? Let's all keep quiet and listen! There. That way! Only prayer can give us strength. Only prayer can secure our rebellion against Spain. Let us join in the liberation of our nation from Spain. Therefore, let us solemnly pray that we emerge victorious as we join the fray. My brothers, upon my last visit at Mount Banahaw, I was able to speak with the Holy Voice in one of the caves. It told me of a ritual that would force the Spaniards to surrender without a fight. This is what the Holy Voice said, my brothers: This coming June, next month, two weeks from now, We will march to Tayabas! And ropes will be the only weapon we'll bring! We will tie those ropes around our waists! And as we get close to the camps of the Guardia Civil and the Spaniards, we will throw the ropes at them! And without our prompting, the ropes will tie them up without a fight! I had a consultation with our Oracle, Agripino Lontok And he has blessed our planned attack on Tayabas. My brothers, as told by the Holy Voice and confirmed by Agripino Lontok, Solemn prayer is needed to ensure that our planned attack results in victory! My brothers, let us submit ourselves to the Holy Voice! This is the time we have been waiting for! Attack, fellow rebels! Attack, soldiers of the Holy Voice! Your children await the day of freedom. Your children await the return of peace. Your children await the return of joy. Omnipotence of the Father, Help my weakness and save me from the depths of my misery. Wisdom of the Son, direct all my thoughts, words and deeds. Love of the Holy Spirit, be the source of all the activity of my mind, that it may be conformed to Divine Will. One day, Jesus Christ will live again! One day, Jose Rizal will live again! One day, Bernardo Carpio will finally come! There on Mount Banahaw! There on the Holy Mountain of Banahaw! For all time, eternally, without end! Forever and ever! Amen! My Brothers! The Beloved Virgin Mary of Banahaw! Hail Holy Queen, mother of mercy, Hail our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; To you do we sigh, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, our most precious advocate, your eyes of mercy towards us. And after this, our exile. Show unto us the Blessed fruit of Thy womb Jesus. Oh, Clement, Oh loving, Oh Sweet Virgin Mary. Have you seen Andres Bonifacio? Caesaria! I'm looking for Andres Bonifacio. Have you-wait! - Have you seen Andres Bonifacio? - Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it! They’re not our foes. Gregoria de Jesus? Sebastian Caneo? My brothers! This is Gregoria de Jesus of the Katipunan! Forgive us for our rude manners. What is this girl doing here? Take her away from this holy place. Take her! Out! What help may I offer to you, Gregoria de Jesus? We’ve been searching for Andres and Procopio Bonifacio. The men of Emilio Aguinaldo brought them to these mountains. We’re here to search for the cave where they have imprisoned Bernardo Carpio. The encanto, the Tikbalang, brought him here. We’re getting ready for his release and his liberation of the whole archipelago. It’s possible one of your men might know what happened to Andres. You might know where they are. If you have heard any stories... None. We know nothing. Andres Bonifacio refused to listen to the advice of the Colorum. Gregoria, wait! Did you know that- that the revolution is over? In fact, Paterno and Aguinaldo are selling it at the Biac-na-Bato. Come join us instead at Mt. Banahaw. True redemption lies there! True peace can be found there! Gregoria! Gregoria, come join us! Hule... Oryang has been going at the hill for several days, standing there until nightfall. Just standing there. She’s hoping Andres will see her. Or hear her voice. The Supremo is dead. Come again? Andres Bonifacio is dead. How would you know? I saw the ghost of Jose last night. Wait there, Sir Karyo, I'll get you some water. Thanks. Where are they? Rosario and Hule fetched Oryang at the hill. I heard Andres is dead. Who told you, Sir? Rosario. She says she saw the ghost of Jose. Rosario! I was told you saw Jose's ghost. What did he tell you? He was weeping. You did not talk to him? Was he the only one you saw? Jose is dead. Jose is dead. It's only a dream, we don't know the truth yet! Hule... Karyo. Where's Caesaria? She's near the hill. She's secretly looking over Gregoria. Is that so? Tell you what. What is it, Karyo? I have a hunch... Hunch with what? We're here for more than three weeks. But not a sight, or even the smell or any clue! Of course, I am referring to Andres and Procopio. I was thinking... They may be buried under the river so there would be no marks. Why did you say that, Karyo? Watch! This is Mt. Buntis. This is Mt.Tala. At the forest, there is this connecting river. Maybe they were buried here at the deepest part of the river so, there won't be any marks left. Maybe their bodies were tied to the biggest rocks. Then they were thrown at the river. Could that be true, Karyo? Told you it's a theory. But how do we scan through the river? It's impossible! Do we tell Gregoria about this? I don't know. With her current state- it's like we can't talk anything about this to her. What I fear most is that she might go completely mad. Pitiful. I agree. Pitiful indeed... I cry over her situation every day. Seems like she's a few steps away from being crazy. God forbid. If it were up to me, Karyo, let's not tell her about your hunch. Should I approach her now? Let her be. Why are you looking here in the forest, Gregoria? Andres and Procopio were taken here. What if they weren't brought here? And they were just confusing you? They were brought here. They might also be killed here. And they might also be buried here. In graves no one would know. We will see them. But for how long can you stand this forest, Gregoria? Three weeks? Ten days? Perhaps one year. Or one hundred years. What if you won't ever see them any longer? We will see them! Lazaro Makapagal is not stupid as well as Emilio Aguinaldo. As the saying goes, "The steps of a criminal are always ahead." Wise. And any wise man can outwit even the purest heart. - The truth shall come out. - The truth? Were you, Gregoria de Jesus, caught in a situation when you have to deny the truth? Will that time come when you would deny the truth? There were rumors. When they attacked you in Limbon, you were tied on a tree. Then you were dragged inside a hut with no one inside. A lot of people heard your scream, your plea, your cry for them not to harm you. - I won't deny the truth. - Well, then. I got one question. Were you raped by Agapito Bonzon and Pawa? Silence is denying the truth, Gregoria de Jesus! Karyo... I just witnessed a while ago... Caesaria- she nearly jumped off a cliff. I got something to tell you. Caesaria told me this story the other day. I will tell you but- don't judge her. We're just the same. If I tell you, promise me this. Let her tell Gregoria de Jesus everything. Please, forgive me, Gregoria. What for, Caesaria? What I did was horrible. I want God to punish me. Did you know that I've waited for so long for us to be alone? I was building up courage to reveal to you what I’ve done. What are you talking about, Caesaria? You are all my victims. I am Caesaria Belarmino. The celebrated beauty of Silang who caused the downfall of the revolution begun by Andres Bonifacio. What? I’m telling you the truth, I am the beloved mistress of the Spanish Captain-General. I have no time for such jokes, Caesaria. This is not a joke. This is a confession. I had been the eyes and ears of the Captain-General. It was on his bed that I brought all the major decisions made by the Supremo and Captain Emilio. The battle in Silang? Everyone was wondering how the Spaniards knew about the secret passage in the mountains behind the town. I told them. I was the crucial key of the Captain General. It was I, Caesaria Belarmino, who guided them- I beg you. Kill me and end this. Please, Gregoria, kill me. All the townspeople in our district were silent. Obedient to all the whims of the friars. They all witnessed how the friar grabbed me at such a tender age to tend to whatever he desires. One time, my father dared to complain, he was thrown in jail. They took his farm. My mother pleaded "Have mercy on us!", “Please help us!" Everyone was afraid. Everyone was blind. I am full of remorse for my act of betrayal but I was overjoyed when our district at Silang was burned down. I am the traitor of the revolution. It's true, I am brimming with hatred for you at the moment, Caesaria, and I could kill you, but I have no right to judge you. And not one of the townspeople of Silang have the right to judge you. Thank you. My self-contempt and loathing for the world were eased somewhat. What can I do to completely remove this curse from my being? How could I answer that, Caesaria? When I see no answers for my own questions? Please, forgive me for what I’ve done to you, Caesaria. Come. Avoid making a noise! Why, Isagani? There were people tied up over there, Sir. Come with me! Take care, Isagani! Help me! Come and help! Help me! You're still not used to it? You're still shaking. Why don't you go get some fresh spring water? Where's Isagani? He hasn't returned yet, Sir. What's your name? Crisanto, Sir. Crisanto Agpalasin. Where are you from? I'm from Dulong Himpil, Hagonoy, Sir. I know that place! The fishes there are delicious. I have a friend who gets supplies of fish from that area. I'd like to ask you something. With your age and agility, how come you're not part of the revolution? You can be a lot of help. Sir, I can't- I don't want to kill people. But what if- if it comes to a point where you have to kill someone? I don't know, Sir. In simpliest terms, that is the meaning of the revolution. And what you and Isagani saw, is just one of those cruelties happening in a revolution. But such things are bound to happen. At times like these, the violence and cruelty of man arise. There's a monster within all of us. I can't really kill, Sir. Go look for Isagani. It's best that we move on before it gets dark. The constabularies might come and catch us. Yes, Sir. Isagani... relax. How can I, Sir? What if there are bandits? What if there are guardia civils? What if there are constabularies around? There are plenty of snakes. Black snakes. Big ones! Two metres long. I don't like those jokes, Sir. I'm not kidding, Isagani. This forest is very ripe with snakes. They really kill. So, it's important that you take it easy. Observe the place rather than mindlessly moving. Are you alright, Sir? Help me with this. Tomorrow, look for someone who'd help us. Sir Simoun can't walk anymore. Instruct him to bring a hammock. He will be paid at the end of the journey. - Got it, Sir. - Is this clear? - Yes, Sir. Isagani. It's nearly dusk. The boatman isn't here yet. I take it he's not coming. He's not paid yet, Sir. So I'm sure he'll come back. Isagani... You still haven't lost faith in humanity. How about you, Sir? Should I be trusting you? I'm still human. I'm still human, Isagani. What kind, Sir? Like you. But I must admit, and I accept the fact that I'm weak. There was a time when I was full of idealism. I only have the freedom of our country in my mind. There was a time when I can't even kill a cockroach. It's just sad that at the end, dark clouds loomed in my world. Darkness gripped me. Anger took over me. Sorrow ate me up. Sorrow held me like I was never getting out of it. I'm asking for your forgiveness, Isagani. I'm asking forgiveness for all the things I've done to you. How can I forgive you? Sir Crisostomo Ibarra? You destroyed everything in my life! Until now, I cannot get out of this quicksand you made. And so are the other people you fooled. You made us instruments of that darkness in your soul! You want me now to go over the damage you've done in my life?! You're an animal, Sir Simoun! You're an animal, Crisostomo Ibarra! Your darkness has no measure! Forgive me, Isagani. I will wholeheartedly accept whatever punishment you give me. Any news, Isagani? The boatman hasn't returned yet, Sir. If he still won't come, let's proceed. I don't know how to paddle, Sir. You can always learn new things, Isagani. Brothers, pistols and Remingtons. Brothers, you can leave me up to this point. Thank you and take care. Take care. Please, send my greetings to Emilio Jacinto! Careful with these steps. Let's stay here. How are you feeling, Sir? Why didn't we go by the road or ride the boat up the river? It’s easier. It's dangerous. Also, the river curbs to another direction. When are you going to pay me? Don't you worry, Sir. I will pay you when we reach our destination. Can I just get a downpayment? I just wanted to be sure. This isn't an easy task! Isagani... Please, hand me over my luggage. Your downpayment. Where are the two guys? They're looking for additional food, Sir. Here, eat this. I'm interested in your works, your poems. You’re quite well known among the intellectuals and the academe. They’re all praises for you. Your professors. Even the priests. A leader of activists, unparalleled in debate, poet, historian. “Genius,” that’s what Padre Fernandez calls you. With a touch of sarcasm, Sir? I know, Sir, that a lot of those praises serve to cover up the jealousy and daggers aimed at my back. They would much rather slit my throat. I am familiar with the smell of treachery and the appearance of a traitor. They will be overjoyed to hear that I have burned all my writings. Burned them all? All of it? Yes. I don’t need them. My stomach turns every time I read them. What a waste. There are others who need them. In my view, the perception that the world needs poetry or any other medium of art is merely a romantic notion. Only a handful understand and think that way. Ah, that’s where you’re wrong. The world needs art for its soul. Art is selfish, Sir. Decadent, hedonistic. One can possibly perceive an artist as selfish, but art itself—never. The artist is distinct from his art. How can art save a starving Indio? How can art save a country like Filipinas? Tell me, Sir! Art only expresses and states one thing: Freedom. You have a way with words, Sir. But for me, for me, art is dead. No, Isagani. The art in you will never die. You’re a creator. One day, you will write again. Sir? Sir Simoun? We can go back to the city, Sir. We'd look for a doctor there. Take me to Padre Florentino. Let’s keep moving. Let's rest first. We just got back from a long walk. It also looks like it's going to rain. Let's go... Tata Sebyo said, you will not get hurt by bullets, you will not get wounded by swords. And the amulets only cost ten cents! So, my friends and I enlisted. Even my grandfather bought an amulet. He was boasting that he was now invincible. Well, during a skirmish, all my friends died. They were shot to death like chickens. Turns out, the amulets don’t work. That Tata Sebyo was such a liar. So many died. It was a good thing. My grandfather and I were out mid-sea, fishing. Up to now he believes in the power of his amulet. I saw how they were killed. What, Sir? I saw how they were killed. Andres Bonifacio and his brother Procopio. Andres Bonifacio? Yes! It so happemed I was then planting in a clearing. I've just started digging when I heard noises. Horse's hooves. I don't know. Terror crept inside me. I looked for the source of the noise. And then I saw them. A group of soldiers and a man riding on a horse in front of them. I also saw one guy. He was tied up and he's being pulled by the soldiers. Then this other guy, he's in a hammock and they were carrying him. I checked to see who's in the hammock. And to my horror, That's Andres Bonifacio! They went on with their journey. Until I couldn't hear their conversations any longer. But I still kept my glance on them. At some point, they stopped. Then man on the horse whispered something to one soldier. Next thing happened was, they hacked the brothers to death! Yes, Andres and Procopio! Horrifying! I was really terrified! I ran away. A few steps after, I suddenly heard gunshots. I went down on my knees. I thought they saw me! I thought they're aiming their shots on me! But when I felt my body, I thought, "Such luck!" I wasn't shot at all! That's when I knew to whom those bullets were for. I am very sure it was for Andres and Procopio! Are you telling the truth? Yes, it's true. I saw it! Surely, they were Emilio Aguinaldo's men. I know! I heard that the group of Gregoria de Jesus is in this forest. They're looking for their bodies. Do you know where they’re buried? I told you I ran, right? I didn't know what happened next. Of course, I got scared I'd get shot if they see me. Help me! Please, help me! Don't worry... What's your story, Blessed Virgin Mary? I'm from Miag-ao, Iloilo in Panay. I'm a farmer's daughter. We live in a small hut but we're happy. There are seven of us and I'm the fourth sibling. One day, there were men from Bulacan who came over. They came because they saw something in our hut- a big, black hole from the sky, and they said that's why they came over to our hut. I'm just ten years old by then but they said, I am the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Colorum. I refused... I told them I don't want to. My mother was refusing also but what can we do? We didn't know Father is a member of the Colorum. I want to go home now. I don't like it anymore. I never wanted to. Sir Karyo, quick! - The Colorums! - Beloved Virgin Mary! The Colorums! Beloved Virgin Mary! Beloved Virgin Mary, come down this instant. Come down right now. Quick! - That house will soon burn! - I don't want to! Come out now... Come out now or it will get burned! - If you don't come out soon, you will all get burned! - I don't want to go with you! - I'm begging you. Please! - No! I don't want to! You are the spirit of the Colorum, I'm begging you. - You are the spirit of the Philippine islands! - There's no spirit! I won't come with you! I won't come with you! There's no spirit! You are needed in our congregation, in our community! We need you! Come out now, Beloved Virgin Mary! - No! No! - That house will burn! -There's no fire! There's no spirit! We need you! We will go to Banahaw! In the holy mountain of Banahaw! There, your throne awaits you! - It is waiting for you! - There's no throne! No throne! Your heaven is there! Come out there now, please. I don't want to... We're here... There's no way I'm coming out. If you don't come out! We will burn that hut! We will burn that down! I will count from one to ten! If you won't still go down! We will burn that! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six. - Thank you, thank you. - Seven. Thank you so much. I'll go down now. He'll burn this house. Eight! - God bless you. - Nine! Nine... Our Beloved Virgin Mary. Let's go now. Let's go back to our place. Our heaven. There, you are our queen! Our Beloved Virgin Mary. Blessed Virgin Mary. Let's go. Only you my soul worships, my beloved O purity incarnate, great beauty unmatched Exquisite perfume of an unblemished flower Gentle spring of joy and inspiration’s power Eden found, fount of happiness sublime The joy you bring can last me for a lifetime For your teasing glance and the sweetest of sweet smiles Buds of flowers gladly bloom for miles and miles and miles Blind trust in your mercy, somehow my heart abides A rope of hope that I cling to until this fear subsides You’re my life, my salvation, you will not let me down In this sea of uncertainty, you will not let me drown Still humble, still earnest, in the end I still will beg you Grant a measure of your love to this supplicant so true Even pity is a choice, in a hopeful beggar’s fashion Better that, than toxic life, without hope and without passion Better that, than toxic life, without hope and without passion Brethren, we are inviting you tonight to a feast! Your children await the return of joy! Omnipotence of the Father, help my frailty and save me from the depths of misery. Direct all my words, thoughts and deeds. Love of the Holy Spirit, be Thou the source of all the operations of my mind, that they may ever be conformed to God's good pleasure. One day, Jesus Christ will live again! One day, Jose Rizal will live again! One day, Bernardo Carpio will finally come! There! In Mt. Banahaw. There on the Holy Mountain of Banahaw! For all eternity, forevermore, endlessly and eternally! For ever and ever. Brethren! Let's share these offerings for The Great Bernardo Carpio! Tell Isagani I'll talk to him. The farmer wants to have a word with you. Be careful, Isagani. They don't seem nice. Why, Sir? Mister Isagani- please tell your boss, we need to get the full payment. But you haven't fulfilled your duty yet! We have to reach the place of my uncle! Well, if that would be your attitude, then- - mind your own from now on. - Hold on, Sir. I will consult this to him. Wait. Sir, they're asking for the full payment. Send them here; including the boatman. Is it true what Isagani was saying? That's our right! We've already agreed, Sir. Don't you realize how hard the task is for us? We are always in danger. What if something bad happens to us? So I think it's just right that the full payment be given to us now. Learn how to honor agreements. We already agreed on it. An agreement is an agreement. We are men of principles, right? Are you insulting us? Calm down, Sir. We're trying to settle things. We are humans. We're not animals. - So many words. - Sir, please. - Calm down. - Well then. How about this? I won't give the remaining payment and I want you to just leave. Sorry. I can't accept your stubborn refusal to work as agreed. Up to you! Bullshit. I'm going. But what about the payment? Will you just shut up? Let's go! Bullshit! Sir. I can't carry you. My Uncle's place is still a bit far. Please, help me get up, Isagani. Sir? Help me rise to my feet. Come. Wait. Better that you leave me here. Look for someone else to assist. Go now. Get moving. - How about you? - Nothing will happen to us if you don't move. Go ahead, Isagani. Get going. Mister Isagani! We finally agreed- we will just continue our work as agreed. - I have one favor to ask. - What is it? - That you will really fulfill your duties as agreed. - Sure! Thanks. Wait up. This rain's getting strong. I'll look for some shelter. Isagani! They stole the luggage! They stole the luggage- Go after them! - Where? - I don't know! Fool! What happened, Isagani? Where's my luggage? I saw it. The farmer killed the boatman! Isagani, you have a gun! Go after him! Get my luggage, and if they don't give it, shoot them! Don't be a coward, Isagani, don't be! I'm asking forgiveness for what he did. Rosario. Rosario. Blood! I don’t want to die. Not yet. Where is it? Where is the blood of Bernardo Carpio? Where is the talisman of the Tikbalang? - Give me some! - Why? I need it! Bernardo Carpio has no talisman! There's no Bernardo Carpio! A mythical creature cannot save you! Stop speaking and give it to me! Not true at all, Karyo! A figment of your imagination, Karyo! Lies! No! - Poison, Karyo! - You're an animal! - That's poison, Karyo! There's no Bernardo Carpio! - Give it to me! You animal! - Bernardo Carpio isn't real! - Please, have mercy on me! Have pity. Give me the talisman. There's no talisman, Karyo. There are no amulets. There is no Bernardo Carpio. I met a blind girl. Her name's Ramona. You're the one who taught her the last poem of Dr. Jose Rizal? When I was lost, not so long ago, Sir, they were the ones who took care of me. Ramona... and her good mother. I was amazed with what I saw. A blind girl reciting Dr. Jose Rizal's poem at the streets! Farewell, my adored land, region of the sun caressed Pearl of the Orient Sea, our Eden lost, With gladness I give you my life, sad and repressed; And were it more brilliant, more fresh and at its best, I would still give it to you for your welfare at most. On the fields of battle, in the fury of fight, Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy, The place does not matter: cypress, laurel, lily white; Scaffold, open field, conflict or martyrdom's site, It is the same if asked by the home and country. I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to show And at last announce the day, after a gloomy night; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow, Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so, And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light If over my tomb some day, you would see blow, A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses, Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so, And under the cold tomb, I may feel on my brow, Warmth of your breath, a whiff of thy tenderness. Let the moon with soft, gentle light me descry, Let the dawn send forth its fleeting, brilliant light, In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh And should a bird descend on my cross and alight, Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site. And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ry And only the dead to vigil there are left alone, Don't disturb their repose, disturb not the mystery: If thou hear the sounds of cithern or psaltery, It is I, dear Country, who, a song t'you intone. And when my grave by all is no more remembered, With neither cross nor stone to mark its place, Let it be plowed by man, with spade let it be scattered And my ashes ere to nothingness are restored, Let them turn to dust to cover thy earthly space. Farewell, parents, brothers, beloved by me Friends of my childhood, in the home distressed; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day; Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, who brightened my way; Farewell to all I love; to die is to rest. Sir... nothing's greater than that poem. Nothing. - My beloved Filipinas. - My beloved Filipinas. It's so lovely to watch the sun rise. Are we still far, Isagani? We're getting close, Sir. We'll be there estimately the day after tomorrow. In San Diego- in my youth, I wake up at this time of the day. I watch the sun rise often. And then I dream. I always say: "There goes the hope they've been depriving my poor country." One day, my country will get have that dream. And when the sun completely rises up, I feel it in my hands. And then I realize: there's no failure in an ideal struggle. That there's no failure with just the right patience. How do you think could we achieve that freedom, Sir? There's no cardinal rule, really. In the real world, in the real sense, freedom is just a concept. It's an idea or an ideal. We all have our own definitions of it based on our own experiences, stature, awareness, perspective, and our cultural backgrounds. The true question to a Filipino setting is: What is the true Filipino freedom? Indeed, what is Filipino freedom, Sir? These days, it is clear that Filipino freedom is emancipation from Spain. But Filipino freedom is greater than that. Freedom requires long discourse. Filipino freedom demands exhaustive struggle. Being free from Spain is just the start. The next step is up to you, Isagani. Search for the Filipino freedom. We're getting closer. Probably an hour's walk. Here you go. Here's the full payment for all your help. I'm giving it to you now before we part ways. - Thank you! - And thanks for your patience. And this one's for your loyalty. No need! - This is enough. - Take it, please. This will do... Accept it. My token for our friendship. Accept it, Sir. Okay. Thanks for your loyalty, friend. Good morning, Mister Simoun. Good morning, Fr. Florentino. - Madamme Martina? - Yes, Father? - Please prepare a hot coffee for Mister Simoun. - Yes, Father. That cliff seems high. Isn't that dangerous for him, Father? He's often there. He loves that place ever since. Might be his place of waiting, or a place for dreams. He wrote his first poems there. He loves to wait for sunrise there. That is where he waits for the dawn of a new day. - Madamme Martina? - Yes, Father? Is the chocolate hot yet? Not yet, Father. Wait up. Isagani. Uncle. Why won't you rest? You've travelled far. I'm not sleepy, Uncle. Your burden catches up with you. Who can be at peace with this turmoil, Uncle? Someday, it will pass. Heaven knows the right time for it. When do you think it is? Who can tell? We can't tell heaven's thoughts. Uncle, I still can't forgive Sir Simoun until now. My respect for you is greater than my hatred that's why he's still alive. And I am thankful you didn't take revenge on him. I took it! My plan to kill him was stopped. Nevertheless, I was never able to get him a quack doctor or a doctor during our journey. I pity him but- inside me, there is joy everytime he's in pain. Get rid of hatred, Isagani. If you let it stay within you, it will crush your soul. Give him time. You will soon forgive him. Why aren't you sleeping yet, Isagani? That's one nice music, Uncle. Thanks. Mister Simoun- would you wish to pray before we sleep? To whom, Father? To the God of the universe. To the God of kindness. I'd rather stare at the fullness of the moon. I have a request. What is it, Sir? Can you help me sit? I want to stare at the moon's light hovering the sea. Can you still do it? A man who is about to die- is not feeling any kind of pain anymore, Father. Wait, I'll call Isagani. Isagani. - Isagani! - Yes, Uncle? Help me make Simoun sit. Let me lie down. Careful, Isagani. Is that all, Uncle? Thanks. Sleep tight, now. Thank you, Father. Let's go! Mother... Thank you. Dear Padre Florentino, He will be arrested. Dead or Alive. Don Tiburcio left, rushing. Why? He thought, he was the one Lt. Perez was referring to in his letter, and it's Doña Victorina's doing. Until now, he's scared of his feisty, talkative and cruel wife! They've been chasing each other for months, Uncle? That woman is different, that's all I can say. Her attitude is not right. And a lightning might strike me; rainy days are here. Uncle, what is Sir Simoun's reaction with the telegram? He didn't say anything. If we bring him with us when we leave, I think it's better to leave soon. I think he can no longer have the strength to go with us. He needs immediate treatment. He prevented me from calling a doctor to attend to him. Are we waiting for him to get caught and be shot by the guardia civil? I think there's nothing we can do. Now that the news has it that the Captain General was removed from his position. Not so long ago, the Captain General, Simoun, Quiroga and other businessmen controlled these islands. They're like formidable forts. In an instant, they crushed. That's fate. But Spain's empire is still here. Most likely, they'll be replaced by people like them as well. I hope your hunch won't be true. Not a hunch, Uncle. History repeats itself. This seems to be the curse of this country. Spain has stayed here for more than three hundred years. Why? We've been slaves to oppressors for a long time now. Why, Uncle? The friars have been messing with us for so long. Why, Uncle? We've been under selfish, cruel and greedy leaders for so long. Why, Uncle? We have long been slaved by landlords. Why, Uncle? Every day, so many women are being raped! And none of us are speaking about it. Why, Uncle? Ninety percent of Filipinos have no chance of getting an education! And I can't understand why, Uncle?! Every day, hundreds are dying of sickness and epidemic, and of hunger! Why, Uncle? Is it meant to be this way? Why can't we do anything? Why is this country cursed so? Why is this the blight of the Filipino? Why, Uncle? Look in the mirror, Isagani. Look at your reflection. Dissect every fiber of your breathe, the touch of wind in your being, and even the depths of your soul. You know the answer. The roots of your questions have answers. Everything you've said shall have answers. The future lies in young people like you, that chance to change everything. Move! Correct our failures! The future of this pitiful land lies in your hands. - Don't wash me clean anymore, Martina. - It was an order by Father Florentino. - How long have you been a slave? - Since I was young. How many kids do you have? Five, Sir. Please, get my luggage. Please, get the beige pouch. For you. No, Sir. Please, accept it. Just like Fr. Florentino's kindness to you, this is my part. You are now free. You can start living a life with no one oppressing you. - Take it. - Thank you very much. Please, get the silver pouch. Please, untie it. Please, call Father Florentino. - Urgent. - Thank you once more, Sir. Sir Simoun is calling you. Urgent. How are you feeling, Sir Simoun? In a little while, the pain shall end. Merciful God! Why did you drink this?! Father... What are you doing? I got antidotes for poison! There's no cure. This poison has no antidote. The poison is from Qinghai, China. Quiroga's people said: "All shall perish!" Why did you do this, Sir? I must not be caught alive. I don't want my secret to be known. There are only two people who know. I will tell you... my secret. And I have some requests. To unburden my soul. There's still a cure, Sir. Don't, Father. Don't waste time. My name is Simoun. And I am making a confession. I am confessing. In my desire for revenge I planted discord. I planted chaos. I schemed to spread darkness a darkness that razed and engulfed my country. I resolved to answer hatred with hatred, cruelty with cruelty, from Devil to Devil. I’ve been searching for the face of God in the savagery of the Spaniards. I have been looking for God’s justice in the atrocities of Spain. Where is God in the hellish suffering of my people? My name is Simoun and I am making a confession. I am confessing. I initiated the upheaval that brought out the unfathomable cruelty of men, and delivered immeasurable suffering to my countrymen. I was enveloped by the blackness of my own selfish gloom. I beg for mercy from the people I have hurt, and the nation I have harmed. I am Juan Crisostomo Ibarra, son of Don Rafael of San Diego, son of my country, Filipinas, of my country overcome with suffering, of my country, full of sorrow, of my country, aspiring for freedom. I am Juan Crisostomo Ibarra. I am making a confession. I am confessing. I am confessing to my country. Aling Hule, I think we won't see what we're looking for. What is it, Caesaria? Let's save Oryang. I think she's about to lose her mind. Let's leave. This place is hell. Gregoria. Gregoria... Let's go, Gregoria. We must leave now, Gregoria. We'll just get back here if you wish. But we must leave soon. Come. Gregoria, we won't see them anymore. For thirty days, I searched for Andres Bonifacio. Thirty days, I searched for the remains of the man who started the Philippine Revolution. No trace, no hint, no answer. Nothing can match the depths of doubt. Nothing can match the depths of horror. Nothing can match the depths of sorrow. What I saw was the cruelty of man to man. What I saw was the complexity of man's soul. What I saw was the darkness of man’s soul. What I saw was a nation searching for its own soul.
