BORDEAUX, A SATURDAY Hello, Mr. Morlaix. How are you? How are you? Look over there. Quickly. Thank you. You're very kind. Oh my goodness. That's very nice. Thank you. My poor friend. Well, it's your business. Isn't it enough to watch her on television? Don't you see how ridiculous you are? Of course not. An announcer. Hold the door. You could at least answer me when I speak to you. Before mooning over her, can I know where you were? You leave the office at four o'clock. It's now five o'clock. Saturdays too. Your so-called overtime... You're not walking, you're dragging yourself around. At the office too. You spend your life dragging. You even drag your feet! Take your shoes off! Don't even bother. Look at this! Now I have to run the vacuum. Oh my goodness. You should help out. It makes people happy. Good thing I'm your maid. What kind of a pigsty would you live in if you were alone? But you wouldn't be alone. There's the bistro. And I know what I mean by bistro. Why not the Rialto or the Perroquet Bleu? I'm sure you're tempted. Maybe you've already been. When Uncle Paul had emphysema. While I was in Niort. Ten days! You weren't bored. Admit you've always liked those women. Talking to yourself now? What are you saying? - Mrs. Morlaix. - You said "Mrs. Morlaix." That's me. So repeat what you just said. "Mrs. Morlaix" what? Mrs. Morlaix, you piss me off! - What? - You piss me off! You piss me off! There! I'm sick and tired of you! Shit! Call the police! What happened? She's from the sixth floor! I think she jumped out of the window. I didn't see well. I think it's Mrs. Morlaix. - So? - She wouldn't stop yelling at him. He finally answered. - Everyone pities the husband. - I guess. Should we remove the body? I don't know. Inspector Baroni just arrived. I'll be late, but I'll pick you up. Yes. Nothing has changed. We'll eat in Arcachon. Coming. Listen, Annie, I have to work. Just feed the kid before. Beat it. Are you the widower? What was her name? Adrienne. "Adrienne." Why were you arguing? She was complaining. - What? - She was complaining? She complained about everything and nothing. She complained... Okay, right away. It's fine, Baroni. I already questioned him. Sorry, Louis. It was my wife. I couldn't talk. There was no need to come up. Case closed. Accident. We'll be home in half an hour. You're very optimistic. Why? Isn't it obvious? - The stepladder tipped over and-- - Yes, it's obvious. To you. So it was suicide. People who commit suicide open the window even if they get on a stepladder to jump. Can we take the body? Go ahead. If you have doubts, question the neighbors. Done. - Well, because I-- - I know. Arcachon. Inspector Larrieu, you're needed. Okay. Let's hurry up, guys. Let's pack it in. If you find a clue, put it aside for me. I'm off. See you tomorrow. How long did it last? What? All of this. Twenty-five years. In four days. Go on. Eat. Go on. Go on. Good night, little ones. Hello, Michèle. It's me. Yes, your father. I'm going to bail on you tonight. Well... That's a shame. Eat it without me. No, not exhausted. I'm just a bit troubled by something. I don't know. Two boiled eggs. That's what I do best. Shit. Oh my God. Did you forget something? A few questions. Are you allowed to sit when you're not working? It's more comfortable for talking. Yes. You look like I feel. Not much of an evening person. If you see me in the morning, it's even worse. You didn't waste any time, huh? You didn't like the china or the place mats either, huh? And your wife? Did you love her, I mean? It takes a special passion, Inspector, to endure 25 years of Vallauris pottery and Puy lace. I would've opened the window. Excuse me? Before pushing my wife. I'd have opened the window. At least, I wouldn't have shut it. And people saw you shut it. That's what bothers me. As for gas, we're obligated to purchase it from others. Expensive. Too expensive. Our wealth is disappearing and our way of life is threatened. So what can we do? You came. You frightened me. - The party's over, huh? - We just finished. I'm cleaning up. But it's fine. I'll heat you up some pasta, rabbit... It's no problem. - Don Juan will be furious. - Quiet! It's his good conscience day. What's he got on? Evening at the Theater? No, something about the occupation called The Vel' d'Hiv Roundup. And he's already seen it. Sit down. Thanks, honey. Sunday meat pie. Wow. You've gotten your days mixed up. Your mother-- Mine isn't as good as hers. She must've had a secret. Yes, a secret. Like her shepherd's pie. And corned beef. You miss her. At mealtime. Eat instead of saying bad things. Aren't you supposed to watch? I have a pass because of my condition. When the kid'll be here, you can move in with me. Well, in your mother's house. There's a backyard. I'll go live in the concrete jungle. Old people to the doghouse. I announced a love song, excuse me. It's a funny, crazy, macho hymn to die-hard womanizers continually in search of new sensations, regardless of the type. MONDAY ...ending this tragic weekend. And again, the latest news which saw a drug matter explode in the southwest. During a party, the death by overdose of a young Bordeaux society man once again begs the question of who is responsible. The victim's father, a well-known doctor, is being questioned by Bordeaux police. Several people have been taken in for questioning. Sir, I'm Henri Pujol's mother. I'm not involved in that case. I'm sorry. There's no use insisting. Commissioner Lampertuis is busy. Hello. What a bloody mess. You can say that again. Maupas, do you still have contacts in the banks? It depends. You need to verify Édouard Morlaix's account. He's the guy from Saturday. - Didn't Larrieu verify it? - Probably. But let's say he wasn't very zealous about it. - I'll take care of it. - There may be several accounts. I thought as much. No, I'm going that way. What do you know? Zepp. Hi, Baroni. How are your canaries? Fine. Still in a cage like you. What did she do this time? She was at the party that ended badly. You never miss a thing, huh? Tell me, Baroni, why did you give the chief a report that said the opposite of mine? Gentlemen, you're aware that the tabloids are always ready to make things sound worse than they are. Especially when it happens outside of Paris. Yet, we're from outside of Paris. They're worried for us in Paris. They want this problem dealt with as soon as possible. Simplified if necessary but brought out into the open. American-style. The minister wants us to do an exemplary job. Is that clear, Mr. Lampertuis? Perfectly, Mr. Director. Meaning find a scapegoat before the election? Of course not, Baroni. That has nothing to do with it. For now. Just wait. Well. I studied the file. And I won't hide my embarrassment. With just one exception, the young ladies and gentlemen present at this party are all from honorable families. People you and I know. So I'm asking you the question of trust, Lampertuis. How will you proceed? Easy, Mr. Director. Very easy. The victim, Dr. Lacazeaux's son, by all evidence, was led. Misdirected. We have to look into the exceptions. Right now, Marianne Lecouvreur, 20 years old, known as Zepp, is being questioned. She has a record for drugs. We locked her up last spring. For vagrancy. Nice catch. What does that mean? Zepp's a little junkie who's been involved in many orgies. If the Division Director is counting on using her to get to the mafia... Give me two days, Mr. Director. Two. Okay. Is there anything else? An unremarkable incident. An accident. - Yes, the... - Morlaix case. Yes, that's it. You haven't come to the same conclusion as Larrieu? We'll look at that another time. Prioritize last night's incident. Get to work, gentlemen. Baroni, what was just said also applies to you. - Do you have an idea? - Two. - Can I know the first? - Aldo Tortosa. Transvestite at the Rialto-Tamouré. The expense claim is going to hurt. TUESDAY You didn't have the right to do that. You didn't have the right. Quiet. I'm only respecting her last wishes. I'm talking about the burial. We could've had second class, not fourth class with no music. She didn't like music. And couldn't you have gotten an oak coffin? It doesn't burn as well. Small success. I mean, there weren't a lot of people. If it were me, more people would have come. Work colleagues. They still sent a wreath. The irises are from them. The director did things nicely for my wife too. They sent carnations. Your sister-in-law isn't very easygoing. Adrienne wasn't easy either. And... Louise. Louise was somewhat of a character. You can say that about women but... They're characters. Of course, you still suspect me? Yes, of course. Admit that your behavior is strange, almost fishy. - Really? - Yes, fishy. This desire to cut my head off. No, that's not fair. I'm looking for mitigating circumstances. You're too nice. I've had enough of you following me everywhere! Shit! I talked to Larrieu on the phone today. He's a well-mannered man. My case is closed! There! So what are you doing here? You're not the only one who has family here. Well... Yes. "Called to God." You've got nerve. Cremation is forbidden by the Church. No. Not since John XXIII's decree. No kidding. That's good to know. I'm very happy to see you. - Were you looking for me? - No, I'm looking for Tortosa. It seems that thug's no longer in the city because he's not at his club or his house. So look elsewhere. Tortosa didn't disappear. I'll let you drive. Did you take a look? LACAZEAUX CASE Go nuts. You can't believe everything. For a guy with a savings account, the newspaper is the Bible. Some even read between the lines. PARTY DRUG IN BORDEAUX Shall we take a trip to the Pacha? Bastard! You'll talk. Tell us where you got the shit. Asshole. I'll make you talk. You'll see. Shit, the cops! Stop! Don't be afraid. It's the police. - Are you really the police? - Yes. Get up. Got an explanation for this, sir? - I'm a doctor. - You're finishing off incurables? I'm often called at night. - Come in. - So with all these attacks... I understand better now, Dr. Lacazeaux. I'm surprised to find you here. They dragged my son into this. The drugs come from here. And that one's a dealer. I'm sure. You can always make a complaint. Justice. - Do you still believe in it? - You have to believe in something. Justice is like the Virgin Mary. If you don't see it occasionally, you start to doubt. The gun. - You're not going to arrest him? - I am. You'll get the chief in trouble. He can let him go if he wants. I'm arresting him. Are you making a complaint, blondie? No. Of course not. We're taking you in anyway. You too. Let's go. Let me go! That's enough! I'll find witnesses. Good ones that'll talk. Ones that'll sell their parents for a snowflake! Let's go. Don't be scared, kids. I won't bite. WHERE DO DRUGS BEGIN? Well, it's the clingy commissioner. Not commissioner. Inspector. At this hour, you don't have to let me in. If I say no, will you return tomorrow? No, I'll summon you. At the most inconvenient time. Because I'm like that. Okay. Thanks a lot. Has this to and fro been going on long? You're mistaken, Inspector. If only you knew how often I've heard that. Mr. Morlaix never came to my place before tonight. They talk about a lack of communication in large groups, but here not only do you visit each other, you also give each other flowers. That's charming. Were you here when you saw Mrs. Morlaix go out the window? I didn't see her go out the window. I saw her falling. - Same thing. - Not at all. And that's what bothers you. Well, yes. Because a quarter of a second earlier and you'd have seen the window and you'd have seen the husband. Not necessarily. You mean Mr. Morlaix wasn't necessarily near the window? I mean things didn't necessarily happen as you wish. You keep coming here and sniffing around because you have a rotten idea in your big head. Amusing, isn't it? - Yes. - They were very chubby back then. I'm rather scrawny, don't you think? No. Well, yes, a bit. But it's perfect. Do you really think I have a big head? No, I said that, but it's just a manner of speaking. - Speaking of what? - Morlaix. You think he killed his wife to have a relationship with his neighbor. And I'm saying that's stupid. - If you knew me better-- - I came here for that. You'd know that married men suit me perfectly. I like sleeping alone. Don't you? Me... Before, I slept after but now I sleep during. What about him? I mean, what do you think of him? Touching. Someone who has everything to experience. Someone who forgot to breathe and is just about to. Are you going to spy on him for long? I can put an armchair on the balcony and give you a blanket. That's a good idea. I can give you something to drink too. Okay. Why does one become a cop? One doesn't become a cop. One ends up a cop. Thank you. I wanted to be an airline pilot, so... I imagined it like it was before. Blériot, Lindbergh... I didn't realize it was so complex. Such long and expensive studies. My father was a laborer. He didn't want me to become one. No doubt, he was wrong. My father thought police school offered a position and what counted the most for him, job security. So there you go. It isn't disgraceful. And it shouldn't be either. At first, I was even rather proud, only... little by little, politics got its hooks into it. And we went from serving the state to serving power. And that, my dear, isn't the same thing. It's the same in every country. But that's no consolation. So... By dint of doing bad things, we've become bad cops. Normal. Oh my God! Good evening. Come, it's joyful here. May I sit? Haven't we met? Probably. Where? Think. No, that's right. Do you like champagne? - A little carnation, sir? - No. It's the first one of the evening. The car. Wasn't it a paddy wagon? Yes, ma'am. Move your legs, you pig! - I didn't ask you for anything. - It's already paid for. It's from the gentleman. Excuse me. Shall we leave? Nobody's stopping you. At this hour, you'll have trouble finding a taxi. If we leave now, I can take you home. I'm staying. I'm staying because I'm having fun. I'm slumming. Is that how you say it? The day after his wife's burial, gentlemen of the jury, Mr. Morlaix rolled around in a stupor. A stupor. I love that word. Roll around in a stupor. That's what they'll say, right? Have you already rolled around in a stupor, Inspector? I'll have to think about it. I've often thought about it. It usually happened with people of color. In an absolutely exuberant vegetation. Do you know Talua Island? - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. I plan on basking there one day. I'll make love in a hammock. While drinking palm wine. I'll be drunk from morning to night. WEDNESDAY - Hello. - Hi, Baroni. DETECTIVE BUREAU Do you know what I'm doing? A report on the circumstances of Dr. Lacazeaux's arrest. It's already causing a scandal? Even better. It got the grand wizard out of his bed. He put on a tie at 5:00 a.m. And now he's having breakfast with the doctor. The report? Is it coming, Larrieu? Paris demands the immediate release of Lacazeaux. Immediate. You're here? We arrest honest people? And we let the guilty go free. Yes, I know the refrain. Where are we with Tortosa? Tortosa... Yes, Tortosa. You talked about Tortosa. Oh yes! I'll go back tonight. Where are you going? To sleep. - Louis. - Yes? - I was looking for you everywhere. - Well, you found me. I looked into your widower's bank account. Edward Morlaix, account number 5100708L. - And? - And? Nothing. - Shit. - Well, nothing much. But I dug. His wife had all the money. - An account in her name? - No, a joint account. But he never used it. For 20 years, she made all the deposits. Like an ant, you know? - And how much is there? - Not a penny left. What do you mean "not a penny left"? The account was cleared out three weeks ago. Take a guess. It all went to a travel agency. The beaches are lined with coconut trees whose leaves graze the clear waters. Of all the travelers visiting the shores of the Society Islands, who hasn't been charmed to the point of being bewitched. It's over. If you'll follow me. Do you have something in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Morlaix? M-O-R-L-A-I-X. So two tickets for Mr. and Mrs. Morlaix to Talua. The date is open. So I understand open. But Talua... Where is that? In Turkestan, or the Balearic Islands, or... Sir, Talua is an atoll in the South Pacific. I suppose you're interested in how to get there. - Very much so. - I'll tell you the cheapest way. By cargo liner. Do you want the name of the boat? Yes. Cam Iroko, quarterly connection. You're in luck. It arrives today in the port of Bordeaux with its cargo of cocoa and coffee and leaves the same evening. I'll pass by the office this evening. In the meantime, let the strange girl with flowers in her hair go. What's her name again? Zepp? But that was one of Baroni's ideas. Let her go and have her followed. - If that's an order. - It is. How did it go? Variously. - We're letting the girl go. - What? I know. An order from the big boss. I'll put you on a more personalized job. Baroni? Lacazeaux wants his ass, huh? Find me something on Baroni. Maybe the widower thing. And get to the bottom of the Tortosa lead. Not only am I sure that Baroni did nothing, I'm sure it's bogus. Missed your departure again, Mr. Morlaix? - Let's hope it'll work out next time. - Yes, who knows? Let's go in. I need to talk to you. - Take off your coat. - You're kidding. I want to see if you're armed. Do it! The jacket now. I want to see if you have money. - But I'm not leaving. - The jacket, I said! The vest. I want you to feel the cold. This is illegal. I know. Did Adrienne often pose nude for photos like that? If I had asked my wife... It was a dozen years ago. At her sister's place in the summer. What do you care? She had nice breasts. Tell me you killed her. It'll be simple afterwards. You'll feel much better. If I call, people will come. I'll tell them what you did and you'll be in trouble. But you won't. You killed her for this. Two tickets to Talua on the Cam Iroko that Adrienne purchased last week. And you knew it! Bless you. The Cam Iroko is leaving. Don't move! You're going to die, man! You work too much. Double life. Stress. With a fragile heart. Official tailing at night, clandestine tailing during the day. Or vice-versa. Persecution complex. How old are you? Huh? Miss! I thought it was you. It was too late. I'd pressed the button. It's fine. Can I come in for a minute? Didn't we say everything the other day? THURSDAY - Hello? - It's Laurence. Laurence Bertil. I got it from information. Well. I had a visit tonight. One of your colleagues. A handsome guy, very pleased with himself. That's it. He wanted me to testify against you for... What did he say? - Harassment and persecution. - You should've done it. The last time I snitched, I was five years old. Over a package of candy. Thanks, dear. Bastards! The judiciary starts early. Because we have extremely busy days. Your place is nice in the morning. It'll be your place soon. I hope to be retired-- Maybe sooner than you think. - Want some black coffee? - I'd love some. But with a touch of milk. Black coffee with milk? That's just like the people who sent you here. - Nobody sent me. - Of course they did. Absolutely not. Yesterday, I dined with people who I prefer not to name. Important people. - Notable people? - Yes. I'm not sure how, but the conversation turned to the police. Maybe you were wrong to not be tactful about sensitivities. A dyed-in-the-wool centralist. A father investigating the death of his son isn't bad. In our city, people don't beg for their protection at any cost. There is little crime. This is Bordeaux. A certain serenity. A certain taste for good living. Yes, that's true. There's the Garonne. And the vineyards behind it. And Mauriac. Mauriac is never far away. Right? But there are also minors who take drugs and others who prostitute themselves. Like everywhere else. And gangsters and rackets just like everywhere else. And perverts and Dr. Lacazeaux like everywhere else! So there have to be Baronis to clean up all this shit! I couldn't go to the cemetery. I had too much work. So allow me to give you my condolences a bit late. That's good. That's very good. Is something wrong? No, everything's fine. Listen to me. Okay. Let's sleep another 15 minutes. For 15 years I've wanted to sleep another 15 minutes. Since she's gone, things must be different for you. Completely. In every way. And nobody's poisoning this new life? Aside from you recently, no. Pass me my slippers. Here's one. I don't see the other. It must be under the bed. Look carefully. Okay. You know that the investigation into your wife's death is closed, right? Well, officially. You already told me, thanks. Sometimes a police officer fishes with excess zeal. Zeal that could be seen as persecution. Are you talking about Baroni? Exactly. We know he's harassing you. Inspector Baroni isn't really bothering me. Well, actually, he's annoying me a bit. When he forces me to undress on the street. What? You will put this down on paper. I want you to make a complaint against Baroni for cruelty and for unjustified police harassment. It's important. Your condolences were very touching. How are you, Louis? Come in. I heard Lampertuis is out to get you. He's trying. What do you care if that guy killed his wife or not? - You're so close to retiring. - Exactly! I want a commissioner's pension. What if your widower makes a complaint? If he was that kind of guy, it'd already be done. Baroni. It's Scipion. Can you help for my permit? We'll have to see. What do I get in exchange? Your little girlfriend? She's here. Of course we'll give you your permit. You've got the swankiest, best-kept hotel in the city. Don't move. I'll be right there. I want him to stop eating. And stop sleeping! I want him to think of me 24-7! I'll annoy him until he cracks! Yet, he's nice to me. How would it be if... I was looking for you. Lampertuis is flipping out. He's waiting for you. - What's going on again? - It's Zepp. She slipped away from Cambon and Durieux. Great. That's all we needed. Shit! There you are. And the Tortosa affair? Is it moving along? - There are only 12 hours in a day! - Listen to me carefully, Larrieu. Everything else can wait. I want to find this little slut! Put everyone on it. Team up with Baroni if you have to. No! You know what I think of him. Me too. He's a nasty old pig. But he can waltz backwards. - No, I stopped smoking. - Again? Yes, again. I suck licorice. Like in elementary school. - Hi, Louis. - Hi. She's upstairs. Five. "She" who? Not Zepp? - Is she alone? - No. With a scumbag. - Do we know him? - Yes. Strada. He plays trumpet at the Rialto-Tamouré. Thanks. - Do you have a warrant? - Yes. - But you forgot it at home? - Yes. What's going on? Can we know? Cover your breasts. They'll get cold. Thanks, Louis. How long you been supplying her? Two hours. I don't know her. Listen, Strada. I don't think you understand. We play. We lie. We pretend to take you seriously. I'll ask you a question and then we'll be done. Does Malmoë mean anything to you? I'm a musician, not an informant. I don't want to be a bother, but I don't think the intelligent one is you. You could've done better, Louis. - You too. - Okay, I'm going to my mom's. If you take me, you'll have Mr. Walheim of Zurich on your back. Fuck him! So shall we go? And if you're nice, I'll take you to the sea tomorrow. And I'll get totally naked. What are you waiting for, Larrieu. Go! What about you? I'm going back to Tortosa's. It's starting to look like a joke. Yeah, I must say that... Are you coming? Yes. And what about me? Tell me about Malmoë, Tortosa, or Lacazeaux's son. You choose. I don't care. BUTCHER Get in. We're going to the same place. It's not warm, is it? No and... Yesterday in the hangar, I was... There you go. This kind of rain can last all night. Thanks for the ride. No problem. If you're going to watch me all night, you might as well come up. I bought a nice steak. We'll share. - What do you say? - Sure. How do you like your steak? Rare. With pepper. - Can I do anything? - Yes, you can set the table. While I change. Yes. TUESDAY MARIE-JEANNE CARGO LINER Shit. Hey! I can't find the cutlery. The drawer near the sink on the left side. Looking at the cupboard, of course. Here we go. I've got it. I don't want to reproach you but it's been a while since you've questioned me. I actually have a question. A burning one. A banking question. Why did you withdraw all of your money? I didn't withdraw a cent and for a good reason. I had no money. I mean the other account. The joint account. Oh, yes. The one we called "the piggy bank". Adrienne managed it for 20 years. Those things bored me. But there's another possible scenario. You had Adrienne withdraw the money from her piggy bank under any pretext. Then you kill her and go to Talua with... With Laurence? She could be my daughter. That's funny. Let's drink to that. It's not vintage, but it's nice and dry, this Piper. I can't remember why we put it in the fridge. Your silver anniversary? Maybe. After a few years, you forget what you're celebrating. Not long ago, I celebrated 25 years on the job. Truthfully, I've only been out of uniform for 17 years, eight months, and 23 days. And before? Yes. I started in Poitiers. And before? Oh, before... You'd like to charge me, wouldn't you? So I never get on the Cam Iroko. So I miss out on my dream as you surely missed out on yours. That I don't want to know. I was thinking about your wife's photo. - Really? - She had extraordinary breasts. Yes, but her face wasn't great. Mine was the opposite. Really? Adrienne had a very nondescript face. What was interesting was what was on the inside. At the beginning, at least. She's the one who discovered Talua in an old second-hand book. With missionaries and ads for pith helmets. Then, it's weird. Little by little, she gave up on it. It was strange. At the exact time I started getting interested. Starting to watch the Cam Iroko leave. We sort of crossed paths. Is that why you killed her? Not that again? Arriving from Geneva, Air France flight 2029, gate number 11. She'll pass right by you. Take over. Roger. The bitch. - She spotted us. - It doesn't matter. See the guy over there? That's surely her famous Zurich lawyer. I wonder where she's taking him. Nowhere, according to Baroni. But I'd be shocked. They'll surely end up in a four-star hotel. Take a taxi. Follow them. I'll meet you there. We've got time. I'm going to Tortosa's. I'm sure Baroni is getting us into some racket. Do you know Tortosa? He's Tortosa. What? Stay there just in case. I'll take him backstage. Okay. Hey, kids, that was "Paris" sung by Aldo Tortosa. And now at your service, Renata Clark. Shut the door, please, honey. DRESSING ROOM NO ENTRY Larrieu! Aldo! What's happening? Far from all roads. The pearl of the Pacific. Area, 12 square kilometers surrounded by white sand beaches. Exceptional vegetation. There are a few hundred natives and they have a happy disposition. They're welcoming to travelers and the woman, let's say, possess a rare beauty. There. There! Yes? No, it isn't him, it's me. No, but I can hand him the phone. It's your office. Baroni, I'm listening. I'll be right there. - Shit. - Bad news? Huh? The remarkable Larrieu... He was shot like a rabbit. Overzealous at 30, what an idiot. - You were here. It's not your fault. - That's the problem. FRIDAY Go on! Get back, kids! Hands on the wall. Go! The cops! Go ahead, Maupas. This way, kids. You too. There. Look at that. Don't you move. Hands on the wall. Hurry up. DEPARTMENT ENTRANCE JUDICIAL POLICE Was the Rialto-Tamouré one of your ideas? Not to send Larrieu to the slaughter. You should've waited. Waited for Tortosa to come himself. He'd have given himself up and told us about the Lacazeaux kid. We were negotiating. He shouldn't have panicked! What a waste. - And now Tortosa... - What about Tortosa? You don't think you're gonna find him alive? He's causing even more trouble. He's causing trouble for us and for others. SUNDAY There's Dad. - What are you doing here? - We're chatting. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you. - Your friend, Édouard, was-- - What? You didn't tell me you had a grown daughter. That you're going to be a grandfather. I envy you. I was telling Michèle about our youthful exploits. You never told me you went to Atlanta. Or about your adventure with Scarlett. - I didn't think it would interest you. - But... I made it clear that it was before you met Louise. Thanks. I took a look in your drawers. I hoped to find a photo but... A photo of Scarlett? A photo of the two of us. You kept nothing? No. Why did you come by? Henri lost his wallet with his driver's license and ID card. As stupid as ever. He filled out a replacement form. Can you hurry it up? - I'll take care of it. - Thanks. That's nice. I'm off. Goodbye. Thanks for the company. It was a pleasure. - Can you deal with the tray? - Yes. Back to my first question. What are you doing at my home? I don't freak out when you come to my place. I'm even polite to you. I didn't imagine you in this type of setting. The yard, the river... - It impresses you, does it? - Yes. It was my wife's house. That's nice. I have a better opinion of you. That makes me happy. What was that nonsense you told my daughter? The story about Atlanta? When I rang the bell, she opened the door and... - What? - I had to improvise. And Scarlett? It's the name of a woman in a film. I can't remember which one. You were already a bit puffed up. She was much better than you. More distinguished. Probably more intelligent. Leave, Morlaix. Leave before I beat you. How old would she be? It's funny the prejudices one has about cops. Finally, they raise birds, they marry young girls in white, they become grandfathers. You think we sleep at the station and marry meter maids? Michèle is worried about your health. I don't want to get involved as it's not my business, but I know a cardiologist. Shit! MONDAY Tortosa. Baroni was right. In the presence of notables in the department, Bordeaux wanted to demonstrate against crime. The crowd was large and very emotional at the funeral of Inspector Pierre Larrieu. And that's it for the regional news of Bordeaux-Aquitaine. All that's left is the weather forecast for tomorrow. Clear and cloudy weather after mist and fog dissipates in the morning. Low to moderate winds from the west. Smooth sea, temperatures rising. Have a very nice evening and we'll see you tomorrow for our next regional edition. Did they decorate him? The boss was his equal. It's not that Larrieu... But I felt bad for his wife. She's expecting a baby. Life is always melodramatic. Are we waiting for someone? I thought you'd like to eat with Laurence Bertil. - She thinks you're very nice. - Not true. No, it isn't true. That's just it. I'd like you to get to know each other. Did you do this on purpose? Adrienne found this place. It's always her. This Baked Alaska is good, isn't it? Adrienne never made it. All the better. Enjoy. Now you'll be eating out of a tin plate for a long time. Miss Bertil, you'll be flummoxed by my clear reasoning. Mrs. Morlaix saved for years, planning for an end she thought mediocre. During that time, this weirdo dreamed of wahines and coconuts. Last week, he decided to go. Go how? By swimming? The Cam Iroko returns in six months. The Marie-Jeanne, registered in Papeete, arrives here tomorrow, exceptionally. The Marie-Jeanne! I'll continue. He goes to the bank to withdraw the household savings. Too late. Mrs. Morlaix was there before. Fury from Mr. Morlaix. An unbelievable scene. And he kills his wife for 16,772 francs. The price of two round-trip tickets for the Ouahamalous archipelago, not far from Talua. There! I've never heard anything so stupid. But that's what the jury will believe. Why do you want to trap this poor man at all costs? You're making this personal. I am. It is personal. I can't end my career with a failure. His whole life is a dismal failure. Chief Inspector at 50... The jury will believe what we'll tell them. Do you know what I'll tell them? That I saw Mrs. Morlaix fall and that at that moment, Mr. Morlaix was nowhere near her. Well? In your ass, Mr. Chief Inspector. I think I'll treat myself to a cigar. A big one. I've got a date. Goodbye and thanks again. No, let's walk a bit. The weather's good. It's nice to walk at this hour. You won't make fun of me for much longer! What's wrong with you? The boat, the Marie-Jeanne... You wanted to leave on it, right? Ignore him. He's drunk. I know what you want me to believe. That Adrienne bought those tickets to surprise you. That's more likely than my departure with Laurence Bertil. That's extravagant. Adrienne told me off constantly and saved penny by penny, depriving us... depriving herself of so much to give us my dream. Maybe she was unpleasant so I wouldn't suspect anything. And you killed her for 16,772 francs. I didn't kill her for 16,772 francs! I killed her because she sucked the life out of me! There. - Will you put it in writing? - Yes, sir. She was that way for a long time. Why didn't you kill her before? I never thought of it. I didn't think it would be that easy. Hey, Louis! Louis, no. What's wrong? Come. TUESDAY I broke one of Mrs. Morlaix's china cups. What are you doing here? I gave you two sugars. You look less feverish. It's almost nine o'clock. Édouard went out. He asked me to come. He left me this letter. His confession. He told me everything. He'll be back during the day. You won't arrest him? It wasn't a real crime. A crime is a crime, even a modest one, Miss Bertil. Pass me my pants. For the powerful or the humble. And I, Baroni, police officer, I'm here to arrest criminals, whoever they are. My job is to arrest criminals! Afterwards, there are judges. Laurence, are you listening? I know a good lawyer, a smart guy. I'll give his address to Édouard. Huh? He'll use the sister-in-law as a witness. The jury will understand, believe me. He'll be free the evening of his trial. Oh, it's you. We've a meeting with the boss. Go in, Louis. You're the hero of this party. I wanted it to be a surprise. I wanted everyone to be here to celebrate the event that interests us. It's fresh. It's the official notice of your early retirement. It took effect last night. Chief Commissioner Baroni, I congratulate you for... - For how many again? - Seventeen years. Seventeen years. Seventeen years of good and loyal service. I said "Chief Commissioner" as you were named such yesterday. By special decree of the Minister of the Interior himself. There! Now enough speeches. Speeches always put modesty to the test. I'm sure you prefer a toast. - Come on, Baroni. - Thank you, Mr. Director. Thank Dr. Lacazeaux for me. Hello, Mr. Baroni. I'll remove my hat. Don't misjudge me for that. I'm Kurt Walheim from Zurich. I'm a lawyer. Without being indiscreet, Mr. Walheim from Zurich, what the hell are you doing here? Might I say that you brought me here? The idea is an excellent one. It's a calm, quiet place. You must love it here. I'm going to put my briefcase on the table. Okay? Miss Zepp told me that you were... What expression did she use? Oh, yes. Human. That's it. Human. I represent a group of researchers of pharmaceutical products. Particularly Mr. Malmoë. That name probably rings a bell. It rarely appeared on the labels. Mr. Malmoë is very sensitive to the type of affection you have for Miss Zepp and wants me to assure you that Miss Zepp has nothing to do with the Lacazeaux affair. That Zepp! Here I thought she was lost. With her crowns of flowers and bare little boobs. She is lost, Mr. Baroni. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. Zepp is an extremely fragile child, unstable. Mr. Malmoë doesn't want her to be disturbed. To that end, he has immense means of dissuasion. He wishes to... How should I put it? Avoid damages. There was already that foul Tortosa error. Are you worried about a Baroni error? We worry about everything. Mr. Malmoë wishes the unfortunate overdose to start with Tortosa and end with Tortosa. Hello, Baroni? What are you doing? I tried to reach you at your office and-- Don't move. I'll be right there. I'll give you a laugh. I'd be surprised. Don't be in such a hurry! - I took some woolens. Was that good? - Of course. Taking your birds for a drive? Go, Édouard! Hurry or we'll miss it! - Hurry up! - Stop immediately! Since the beginning, I've thought you strange but you're crazy! Completely crazy! I have no intention of watching it leave every month and going home to live my dreams on a map. Obviously that was the weak point. You have a dynamism I never had. Adrienne complained about it. She said I was a drag. But with you, there's no dragging. Let's go. Adrienne was a saint! What? Okay, I'll avoid the scandal. But I warn you! I'm getting off at Gibraltar! Do you hear me over there? Hello, gentlemen. Passports, please. Thank you. Very good. I explained it to her so she doesn't slip up. One-third chickweed, two-thirds millet. And every other day, little flies. Who did you tell all that to? Laurence, of course. I left my birds to Laurence. You ended up, my dear Édouard, giving me the desire for the sun. There's no sun over there. I lied to you. The rainy season lasts three months. After that, it's the windy season. Did you see palm trees on the pamphlets? They're bent 70 degrees like in Quiberon. There are cyclones and typhoons. If I signed a confession, Mr. Torturer, it wasn't to go raise parrots and dance the hula. Nor to splash around the lagoon which, by the way, is infested with sharks and beasts like this. I confessed... I confessed to clear my conscience. To atone in a three by two meter cell where I'd catch tuberculosis. And finally... I don't want to live the rest of my life with a man who killed his wife. How long have you known? Since the beginning when you told me, "She was a character." I... I understood that you killed Adrienne. Louise. Adrienne was your wife. Subtitle translation by: Leanne Bordelais
