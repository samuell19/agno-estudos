(phone ringing) - [Voicemail] You have reached the voice mailbox of... (ominous music) (phone ringing) You have reached the voice mailbox of... - (sighs) Okay. It's just a dream, it's... Jenny. It's not real. He can't hurt you. I just need to sleep. I need sleep. It'll all be okay. It'll all be okay. (Jenny sighs) Jenny. Jenny. Get it together. (ominous music) (eerie music) (light dramatic music) (dramatic music) (electrical zapping) (ominous music) (alarm buzzing) (light music) - [Cameron] Morning, babe. I made breakfast. - Can't, I'm late. - What? - I overslept, I had my meeting with Kirkland this morning. - Oh shit. - Yeah, um. Have you seen a black folder? - Check the counter. - [Amanda] Thank you. - Remember, I'm not gonna be home for dinner tonight. Dustin wants us to work late through the evening on the Witlow case. Here, here, here, here. Okay, I'll see you later. - Goodbye. See you tonight. - Yeah. - Bye. - Oh, take some eggs for the road. - I can't, I'm not that coordinated. (ominous music) Hello? Yes, this is her sister. (eerie music) I'll be right over. (light dramatic music) - [Cameron] What's wrong? - My sister killed herself. (light music) (somber music) (ominous music) (fan humming) - [Cameron] Okay, I'll ask her. Thank you, bye. Hey. - Uh, who was that? - That was Jenny's landlord. She wants to know if we can come by later this week and start packing up some of her stuff. - Oh. Yeah, how about tomorrow? - Tomorrow works. Um, I've got some paperwork I gotta finish but I can do it afterward. - Cool. Thank you for being so good with all of this. - You know that I'm here for you, right? - I know. (lips smacking) (light music) (ominous music) - Quirk. (ominous music) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (light music) (rain pattering) (light dramatic music) (match sizzling) (light dramatic music) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (rain pattering) (suspenseful music) (light music) - [Cameron] I could stay home tomorrow if you want me to. - No, you gotta focus on work. - Well, yeah, but I can take a day off. Jesse might complain a little bit, but we'll be fine. He'll understand. - I'm okay. I'll be fine. - Okay. But I'm here for you for everything. - I know. I love you. - I love you, too. (ominous music) (light dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (light dramatic music) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (muffled talking) (keyboard clicking) (phone ringing) (muffled talking) (light music) (light dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (crickets chirping) (branches snapping) (match sizzling) - Hey. What are you doing up? - Had another nightmare. - Sorry. Everything okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. How was your day? (light music) (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (fire sizzling) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Help me! (woman gasps) - Oh my God, calm down. It's just a nightmare, just a nightmare. (Cameron hushes) Come here, come here. Come here. - I just- - I know, and I'm sorry. It's okay, it's just me, come here. - I just wanna sleep. - I know, I know. (heavy breathing) (ominous music) - It's like every time I close my eyes, I just- - I know, I'm sorry. (heavy breathing) I think you should go and see a psychiatrist. Yeah? - Okay. - Yeah, okay. Awesome, I'll call the Dr. Marsh on the way to work and see what she can do, okay? It's okay, just breathe. It's a nightmare. (ominous music) - Hi, Doctor Morris? - Please come in. You must be Amanda. Cameron has told me so much about you. - [Amanda] All good things, I hope. - Of course. Oh, you know that I used to babysit him when he was a toddler. - Really? - (laughs) Yes. Well, I'm so glad to see that he's landed such a lovely young woman. So, Amanda, what brings you in here today? - Well, I was hoping you could prescribe me something to help me sleep. - You must understand it's not that simple. I'm gonna need to understand what's been going on before I know how to proceed. - Right. Um, well, I haven't been sleeping much lately. I've been having these nightmares. But they're not like normal nightmares. That'd be fine, I could handle that, but these feel, I don't know, they feel real. - Real? - Yeah, I guess that's the best way to describe it. It feels like when I'm there in the dream it feels like something could actually hurt me. - What is it you think could hurt you? - I don't know exactly how to describe it, but it feels like an evil presence. - When did this start? - A couple weeks ago. - [Doctor] What was going on about then? - Um I started having these nightmares right after my sister killed herself. (doctor sighs) - You're going through a really traumatic time and what you're experiencing is completely normal and I do believe it'll get better. That being said, I think I'll prescribe something for you for the anxiety that you're feeling. Just take one of these before you try to sleep at night, it should help you get the rest you need. (doctor sighs) And for the time being I'd like to see you about twice a week if that's possible. - Oh, I don't think that's necessary, I think- - It may not be, but in my experience it's better to talk these things out than to let them fester. (tea kettle whistling) (knocking) - Amanda Williams? - Yes. - Sign here. - I'm sorry, what is this? - This luggage was lost in a transit a few weeks ago. This house was listed as a forwarding address. - Okay. - You have a good night, ma'am. - Thanks, you too. (door clattering) (luggage rattling) (zipper buzzing) (Amanda laughs) (paper rustling) - [Cameron] Hey! - Hey, you're home early. - Yeah, we made some really good progress today so I got to leave a little early. What's that? - Apparently some of Jenny's stuff got forwarded here so I was just going through it. - Huh. That's cool. - Yeah, apparently she had problems sleeping, too. - Uh, that's a little weird. - I mean, not really. I mean, we were always pretty similar when it comes to this stuff, especially when we were kids. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Uh, so how was going and talking to Doc Morris today? - Oh, it was awesome. You were right, she's great. - Yeah, she's a super sweet lady. (light music) (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) (tapping) (dark dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Cameron gargling) (Cameron coughing) (Amanda gasps) - Breathe, breathe, breathe. Okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I know, you're just having another nightmare, okay? I couldn't wake you up. It's okay. (heavy breathing) It's okay, it's okay. - Sorry. It wasn't me this time, it was you, I killed you. - It's okay, it's okay. It was just a dream, it was just a nightmare. It's okay. - I'm not taking those fucking drugs again. - Okay, that's fine. That's fine, that's fine, okay? You know what? Come on, let's get outta here. Let's get outta here and go. (light dramatic music) (heavy breathing) Okay, what do you... what do you need or want? You want some tea? You want tea? Yeah. We have tea, we have camomile around here. We got tea for you. What happened? I thought that those pills were supposed to help you relax. - I thought so too, but it was like I couldn't move, I was paralyzed. - Oh my God, that's so fucked up. Okay, we need you to go back to Dr. Morris and I need to tell her exactly what happened. - I don't know about that. - No, I really think that you should because if those pills aren't working there has to be something stronger that can help you sleep or... Hey, regardless, I will stay up with you as long as you need tonight, okay? - No, you have to prepare for your test. - It's not like I can go to sleep right now even if I wanted to. Come here. Come here. You are the most important thing to me in the whole entire world, okay? Okay? - Okay. - I will do anything that you need me to. - Okay. - Okay? - Thank you. - I love you. - I love you, too. - [Cameron] You're gonna be okay. (ominous music) (bed creaking) (light rhythmic music) (keyboard clicking) (birds chirping) Morning. - Morning. - Did you get any sleep last night? (Amanda hums) Amanda. - I'm a little tired. - I know, that's not healthy. You gonna go back to Dr. Morris today and get some meds? - Uh, yeah, I can go back. - Great. I, um... I gotta go get ready for work. - I was gonna make breakfast, did you want some? - No. - I was gonna make some. - I wish I could, but I kind of overslept. There's a lot to do today before I fly out tonight, so... - Okay. (light dramatic music) Good luck tomorrow. - Thank you. If you need anything today just give me a call, okay? - Okay, I will. I love you. - I love you, too. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (paper rustling) - [Amanda] Hi, Arnold Dubeaux? - Sorry, I'm not taking any new clients at this time. - [Amanda] But I've been having these nightmares. - Of course, we all have trouble sleeping from time to time, unfortunately I'm very busy and I don't have enough time to analyze every stressed out insomniac who comes to my door. - But I've been having these nightmares and last night I had one that was so bad I was paralyzed, I couldn't even move. - Yes, well you see, if you'd look outside my door you'll see a signup sheet for a sleep study at a hospital. Very good for you. - But that's not... I don't have that kind of sleeping problem. I've been seeing this thing whenever I try to sleep. - You've been seeing this exact thing? Come inside my office at once. Tell me all the information you can. Start from the beginning. - And then last night I had another nightmare and the figure was there but it was like I was paralyzed, it was like I couldn't sleep. - Did you take a sleeping aid? - How did you know? - I cannot express to you the importance of not taking a sleeping aid of any kind. - I don't know, I think it was just the kind that I took. I was gonna go back this afternoon so I could get a stronger prescription and- - No. You introduce a substance into your system to deepen your sleep, it will weaken your mind's natural ability to fight off the threat. And there's no telling how severely it will infiltrate. - Uh, I'm sorry what is happening? - These dreams, they feel real, right? - Yes. - Have you done any traveling outside of the country? - [Amanda] No. - Really? Not at all? - I mean, my sister did. - Is there anything that you've come in contact with recently that was from a foreign country? - My sister passed away recently and she traveled a lot and collected things and now all of her things are in my home. - I thought as much. Um, was your sister killed by her own hand? (light dramatic music) I believe that she may have experienced the same phenomenon. It is possible that your sister may have taken a litch. - A what? - A litch. An evil spirit that becomes encapsulated in an object. These spirits feed off negativity of any sort, be that fear, anxiety, guilt, grief, depression, remorse. You name it. The stronger the negative energy, the more easily accessible the person becomes to that spirit. If you're experiencing sleep paralysis it means the spirit already has a strong hold over you. Although it's not too late. - Too late before what? - Before the spirit kills the host. If you can figure out which object holds the litch, that is the only way to break yourself from its hold. Presuming that it's not too late. Do you believe that you have anything like that in your home? - Yes. Okay, what do I need to do? Okay, I need to burn it for how long? Okay, I'll burn it until it's done and then... Okay, I'll call you when it's done. Bye. (fire rustling) (ghostly whispering) - Hey, hey. What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? Are you trying to light yourself on fire? Come on, hey, come on, come on. We're going to Dr. Morris. Come on, come on. (light dramatic music) - Amanda, I have to know what is so disturbing about these dreams? Is there anything consistent in the dreams? - Yeah. The evil thing. And my sister. - Your sister is in the dreams? What is she doing? - It's not what she's doing necessarily, it's more so that she blames me for her death. - Really? Why is that do you think? - I don't know. She called me. The night Jenny killed herself, she called me and I didn't pick up. - So one night out of the blue your sister called you and you didn't answer because you were comfy in bed and the next morning you found out that she'd killed herself. - But there's nothing I can do about that, I should've... I should've just answered the fucking phone. I could've talked her down, I could've been able to... - It's not your fault. You have to know that, it's not your fault. And feeling guilty is not gonna bring her back. I'm glad you told me about this. We can work on this, and together we can help you work through it. But you can't let your fear of sleeping stand in the way of your health and wellbeing. You need to get a good night's sleep tonight, that's the first step. We'll work through the rest of it in time. Okay? I'd like to prescribe you something different. This should eliminate dreaming of any sort. It's designed to put you into a deep peaceful sleep and allow your brain to reset the way it needs to. Otherwise you risk hospitalization. - No, Gubeaux said- - Did you say Gubeaux? As in Arnold Gubeaux? Amanda, Arnold Gubeaux is not a scientist. His studies are not rooted in any sort of fact. He has no data to speak of, he's widely disregarded by the scientific community. Your mind is in an incredibly fragile state. It's very dangerous. You'll begin to microsleep and see things that aren't there to the point that you won't be able to trust your own mind. And if you continue down this path without sleeping for too long, you will die. As long as she takes the medication within the next few hours she should be able to sleep through the night and she'll wake up in the morning and she'll be fine. It's only if she neglects to do this that we have any real danger. - Oh, do you mind if I take this? It's Justin. - It's fine, I'm gonna go inside and change and get ready for bed. - Hey, man. Yeah, thanks for calling me back. Listen, I'm gonna need to postpone. No, I'm just needed at home right now. Yeah, we're all good. Okay. (phone ringing) - Dude, stop calling me. - Amanda, I'm trying to get ahold of you. After you burned the litch- - Dude, seriously, you need to stop, okay? Stop with the litch bullshit. You're crazy, you need to leave me alone. - No, no, no. Hold on, if the spirit is interfering- - Okay, seriously, you need to stop. If you don't, I'm gonna call the cops, I'm not joking. (light dramatic music) - Wait, what, what happened? What? - I... I don't know, I burned it earlier and now it... - You are in danger, so just stay right there, I will be right over and whatever you do, don't sleep, okay? - Hey. You okay? - I just... I'm just ready to sleep. - Okay, all right. I'll prepare your sleeping pills. You gotta take one. (light dramatic music) Is there anything else I can get you? - No, I'm good. Um, how was Justin? What'd he need? - Nothing really. I told him I'm gonna postpone taking the Bar. - What? No, you can't do that. - Yes, I can. And I will. Okay, there will be plenty of other opportunities for me to take the Bar. - Yeah, but we're banking on your firm bringing you on next month as an associate. You can't just- - Yes, I can. Okay? It's gonna be fine. I'll just stay on as a paralegal for another year and I'll just reapply for associate next year as well, I'll apply to other firms. I'll figure it out, okay? I promise I'll be fine. - No, okay. Listen. I love you and it means the world to me that you would stay here with me but we can't... I can't let you miss out on this, okay? You have to go. - No, I don't. I can stay. - No, you need to go, okay? I'm just gonna be staying here, I'm just gonna be sleeping, okay? There's nothing here for you to do. - Okay. If you're absolutely sure. - Yes. I'm sure. But wait, what time is your flight? Aren't you supposed to be out of here by now? - I was supposed to be out of here 15 minutes ago but I think I can make it if I hurry. Hey. Call me if you need anything. Anything. I love you. - I love you, too. - I love you. - I love you. Good luck! - Thank you.

(ominous music) - What's going on? I... - How'd you let this happen? - What? - I needed you. - I didn't... I didn't know that, I didn't think- - You were being selfish. All you had to do was answer the phone. - If you just listen to me- - You weren't there for me. - You're right and I'm sorry. I should've been there. I wish... I wish I could go back in time and fix things, but I can't, and that's something I'm gonna have to deal with for the rest of my life. But you can't keep using my sister like this. And I need you to leave me alone. (Amanda gasps) (light dramatic music) (light music) (dramatic music)
