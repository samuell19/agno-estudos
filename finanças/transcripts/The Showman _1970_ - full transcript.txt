He really is one of the last showmen in England. The real, genuine showmen. He performs himself, he entertains the public, he gives them what he says he's going to give them... And it's genuine! ...if you just come a little closer, give us your attention for a few moments. We're going to give you a free performance on the outside. Entirely free, just to prove to you that we perform in reality, that it's not false, no penny swindle, nothing to deceive you. We're going to bring the young ladies on the outside to prove to you that they are alive. Alright, girls. Let it go! I think I'm one of the last parading shows. Now, what we term a "parading show" is a show where they... they come on the outside. They have dancing girls, or they do a performance on the outside to draw the people's attention, to get them up close, to tell them what they're going to show them inside. The general public, uh... sort of want to see what's going on. They come around to... they come along within easy seeing distance. 'And then we do a performance. 'We tell them we're gonna give them something for nothing. 'And that is one of the main attractions. 'They think they're going to see something for nothing. 'Which we show them.' 'Fire, to anyone, is an attraction. 'Then, when you get them there interested, 'you get the girl down on the floor or on the steps, 'you put the blindfold around, 'which they think, "Well, they're gonna blindfold her." "He's gonna do something here, otherwise you wouldn't blindfold her." 'You call the people close.' The people in front, they come closer to see what's going on. The people behind follow them to see what you're gonna do. Then, while you've got them going, before you do anything else, your fire's still going. While they're interested in that fire, then you start to tell them the tale. Now, ladies and gentlemen. I want you to thoroughly understand that this is no part of our inside performance. It's just a little attraction while we tell you the nature of the show. Now, cutting a long story short, as our time is strictly limited, first introducing to your notice the Great American Knifer. Showing you how we pin these young girls to a board with knives in all different shades of manner and form, as it is impossible for them to move or escape without someone's assistance. Then comes the second part of the show. The Great Striptease Knife Throwing. Showing you how we pin these young girls to a board with knives, every knife touching the naked body as it is thrown. Pinning them to the board in such a manner at each impalement she will remove her garments like the young lady in the Dance of the Seven Veils. But folks, she hasn't got seven veils. She's only got six. Leaving the complete shape of the young lady's naked body on the board with the knives as near as possible. Cold steel against warm flesh. Aha! Last but not least, we are presenting by special permission America's latest and greatest sensation. The thrill that, no doubt, you all read about in the News of the World. It caused a great sensation in a London night club only a few months ago. The same thrill that you saw on television at Epsom on Derby Day only a few weeks ago. The young lady here, known as Fearless Pauline, the girl with the nerve of steel, will go through the Great Indian Torture. The girls are professional. And you have to teach them the way to go onto the stage, the way to... Um, make their compliments. The way to leave the stage... The more applause they get, the better they like it, and it gives them a thrill. We've had various types. We've had... homeless girls, girls who have had trouble at home... Out of homes... And they really have had it rough, some of them. And... it makes you more determined to make them feel more at home. And treat them as one of the family, which... They are human beings, aren't they? So they've got to be treated as a human being. Then you get the best out of them. With nothing whatever to protect her naked body from this flying steel. Now, when I say "nothing", I mean nothing, in every sense of the word. She wears nothing at all. As naked as the day she was born. We will forfeit one hundred pounds to any charity you care to mention if this young lady wears one stitch of clothing during this part of the show. Now, if you're narrow-minded or killjoys, then, for goodness' sakes, stay outside, because this part of the show will not meet with your approval. Because she wears nothing at all. But if you're broad-minded men and women of the world, we have brought you the most daring striptease performance right to your very fairground at a fairground price. It's not five guineas, it's not even one guinea, it's not the price of a packet of cigarettes. After I've given that performance on the outside, they turn round and say, "Well, he must be telling us the truth, "because if he will give us a performance like that for nothing, "it must be obvious that we're gonna get value for money "if we pay to see the show." Now ladies and gentlemen, our space inside is strictly limited. So the first ones to make an application will be the lucky ones and get the front positions. And believe me, the closer you get, the more you will see. Now, we're all ready for commencing. Everything is quite ready. Make a start, someone. The rest will follow, and we shall ride away. Step right forward, folks. Just anytime now. All ready. There's room for a few more before we commence. Make up your minds. Come on now, all ready. We're all ready for showing. You're in capital time to see the gorgeous ladies. It's not bluff, it's no swindle! 'It's not an illusion got up to deceive you. These young girls perform in the flesh, in reality, with nothing to protect their naked bodies from this flying steel. Now we're all ready to commence. Get your places right away now, folks. You're in capital time by coming now. What a thrill! What a sensation! What a figure! A nerve like Davy Crockett, a figure like Raquel Welch. And she wears absolutely nothing at all! What a sensation! 'I was born a travelling salesman.' My father before me was a performer,' which I think I inherited... ...the skills and the personality of being a showman. He came over to this country then, with the Buffalo Bill Show called The 101 Ranch, which toured England and then went into France. It broke up, and my father stayed over in this country. My father and mother were known as the Count and Countess Rosaire. Circus people, of course. I met Wally at Greenford. And from then on... we courted, we married. I don't think I was really attracted to him in the first place, because we were so strictly brought up that we weren't really allowed to... associate with boys. Alright, girls, inside! Don't keep them waiting any longer. Inside and get ready to show. There's not a moment to wait. Hurry along, folks. The young ladies are going inside to get ready to show now. Whether you come or whether you come not, we're gonna start the show. Come a little closer, please. There they are. The young ladies are on the inside stage now. They're alive. There are some of the implements we perform with. They're not put up there for decoration. Every implement you see inside we use at this and every performance. Now we're all ready for commencing. Get your places right away now. We're all ready for showing. Follow the crowd, get your places right now. There's not a moment to wait. You're just in time to see the full programme by coming right away. Hurry, hurry. Forward, please. You're just in time to see the full show. I thought it would be a good idea to... to work it instead of just the ordinary... Wild West show, make it into something with a different name. It wasn't just a Wild West Show anymore, it was... ...er, striptease knife throwing, which the public wanted. We had to do it, we had to give them what they wanted. That's the motto of the showman: "Give the public what they want, and you'll succeed." We just couldn't do any good at the side of other people that were showing this... striptease business. So we had to... do the same thing. But we did it very artistically. We still do it very artistically. And there's nothing nasty about it. It's nice. Ladies and gentlemen, the first part of the performance is the knife throwing. The first impalement is from the feet then all round. Take particular notice, the complete shape of the young lady appears on the board with the knives as near as possible. There's two or three methods of getting staff, girls, But the main one is, I'd put a notice on the front of the show: "Smart young lady wanted to travel with the show. "Must be 18 years of age. Willing to travel." They're usually scared. And... I've got to use my personality and skill to challenge that fear. And within... within a few minutes, providing the girl is reasonably intelligent, within a few minutes I've got her doing the performance as I want her to do it. 'Next impalement is sideways across the naked face and up the spine of the back. Next impalement is across the chest and naked throat, pinning the young lady to the board at the same time. A very dangerous feat to accomplish. He lives the part. He really lives the part. And it is his life. - Isn't it'? - Yeah, I suppose that's it. It's just one of those things. I want to be a showman. I've got the talent. I've got the skill to be a showman, and I think while I'm fit and my health keeps as it is, Pm just happy doing it. - 64, Wally, aren't you? - 63. Nearly 64. Nearly 64. 63... Nearer 64 than 63. Next part of the performance is for the Great Indian Torture with knives, hatchets, tomahawks and scalping axes, showing you how the Indians used to torture the white women previous to burning them at the stake. If you're satisfied, you've enjoyed the show, don't forget to advertise and tell your friends, as our show goes entirely by your recommendation. It won't do you any harm. It may do us a little good. And now, for your approval, the last but not the least, striptease knife throwing, knife throwing in the nude, or the Great Indian Fire Torture. Next, I'll throw those large tomahawks. Next is to throw those large battle axes across the naked temple. That concludes our performance. Thank you one and all for your patronage. Hoping you will advertise the show to your friends, as our show goes entirely by your recommendation. They're coming out now, as they leave. Don't believe what we tell you on the outside. Just ask your own friends and neighbours about the show. They will tell you all about it. Don't feel afraid to ask your friends. Hear what they say as they leave. 'Now ladies and gentlemen, we are presenting by special permission 'America's latest and greatest sensation. 'The young lady here, known as Fearless Pauline, 'will go through the Great Indian Torture. 'With nothing whatever to protect her naked body from this flying steel. 'As naked as the day she was born.
