Testing, testing. Baboo. Testing. It works! It's fixed! It's working, testing 1-2-3. Break to the left! Students of Kent State! [woman on P.A.] Students of Kent State! Students of Kent State! Look at this action. Looks like a bunch of Ken and Barbie dolls, only a lot less political. [Peter] Okay, here goes. My name's Peter. I'm a grad student in poli-sci. Understand. We bury this constitution today with sadness. Okay? With grief. Our big chief executive has slaughtered this innocent piece of paper. Jean. Oh. - Hi, guys. Hi, how ya doin'? I am so freaked. - Old lady's makin' a speech. Hey, listen, Jean, just say what you said to us last night, you'll be fine. You don't know what happens. When I was 12, I had to give a speech in girl scouts She sold more cookies than any girl in Moline, that's why I married her. Anyway, I had this sweet little speech memorized and whamo, I go up there, see spots, and recite perfectly The Gettysburg Address [man chattering on P.A.] There's not much comin' down or anything, have you heard? I'm going to send a telegram to Nixon. Are you kidding?! About the speech, how I feel about it. How do you feel? A lot of things. Hurt. Angry, mostly. I had to write it out five times just to control myself. Thinks he reads 'em? Are you kidding? If he did, he couldn't make a speech like he did last night. Probably just gives 'em to Tricia to make paper dolls out of. Like the genocide of The Black Panthers, okay? And the contempt charges... And the contempt charges that will land the Chicago 8 in the slammer because they told the truth. That's all. Um. Hi. [Peter on P.A.] The final breach of our rights as citizens. What's this all about? Oh, Nixon's speech last night. I think. - Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw it. I was in my room, practicing my drums for this, um, summer gig, and uh, there he was. [Peter on P.A.] Take the power of some push of a banana republic. Did you see it? The speech? [woman] Yeah. Um, So, you're...you're really angry, right? Yeah. Sure, I guess so. Why would you say that? Your hair. And no offense, but you've got... real radical hair, you know? That's just my hair. I'm not political. Do I know you? No. I mean, wel.. I've seen you, but I don't, I don't know you. It's that, yeah, yeah, I'm definitely, uh, definitely seen you, but, uh, I don't know you. Uh, So, I-I, uh, Guess I'll, I'll see ya. Around, ya know. Okay. We haven't closed our eyes and ears to the anguished cries of the people that they are systematically butchering! We must change the time! Duke. Have to listen to pay attention. I am. I am who? You're doing it again. You're not saying my name because you think you're going to embarrass yourself. I'm not going to laugh at you. I'm just trying to... - Okay. Okay. Thandy. Thandy. - Good, that's very good. But the placement of your tongue is still incorrect. It should hit where your upper teeth and upper gums meet. [Duke] It's hard. I know it is, but I... You're doing so well. I promise you. 10 more lessons and you're Richard Burton. Goin' to the rally? Me? [Duke] Don't you care? Well, sure I care. I... I care about helping people. And, uh, My family and my friends. And, uh, grilled cheese sandwiches. Yeah, sure I care. [Duke] Then come. Oh. I mean, uh, I am, I'm against the war and all. People getting killed, but, when it comes to standing around with a lot of strangers, I don't know. The question is, how much longer are we going to let our government go on as murderers all over the world? And the answer must be No longer! All power to the people! [man] Good work. Yeah, tell me with a lie. Okay, we're all here today because we care. Right? And because we want all our voices to become one voice. And say, no more genocide. No more napalm. - [crowd] No! No more Nixon! - [crowd] No! And no more war! Now I want to hear everybody's voice. What do we want? [crowd] Peace! When do we want it? [crowd] Now! [crowd] Ho ho, Ho Chi Minh! NLF is gonna win! Hey, Billy, I'm going to the rally. You wanna come? No, I got ROTC class. ROT-C?! Nixon just invaded Cam... - Tommy! I'm sorry, I keep forgetting. Bill Schroeder, eagle scout. Never even had a zit in his life. Listen, I had a zit once. Ask my mom. It was June, 1967. Okay, then you can come with me. Why? - Because it makes a point that not only scuzzbombs and freaks are against the war, but zit-less wonders, like yourself. - Yeah. Well, you going? Nah. - Look, it's important, Billy. Well, Tommy, I feel the same way about the war as you do, but standing around, screaming about it just doesn't do any good...Hey! Watch it! Ooh! I got bad knees. Aw, I'm sorry. That's okay. I crown you Pi Phi! But I'm not a frat guy. Sorry about your knees. Sorry about your knees. I'm in love. You see this dog? Well, his name is Buster. And you know what we're going to do to Buster? We're going to napalm him. We got some napalm over here and we're gonna pour it all over the little fella. You try it fella, and I'll napalm you. You take action. You saved the life of this little dog. But you won't take action to save the lives of those little children who are being napalmed over there everyday, man. [man] That's right. - It's just one little dog. But Nixon and Kissenger and all the pigs have really done it to thousands and thousands of people. It may be on the other side of the world, but it's your world. [man] Right! Every man that said "no" to this dog didn't say "no" to that world. We have to understand something. We're up against powers we can't even begin to imagine. - He better take his nap, honey. Promise you won't freak while I'm gone? It was 4 and 7 years ago. See? I'm fine. Promise you won't freak while she's gone? Bye, all. - See ya later. Because there's some of us, even many of us out here today, who say, "I just don't care". It just doesn't affect me. But it does. See that. Because you can turn yourselves around before it's too late. [P.A] Before you turn into the plastic zombie they want you to be. Right on! Hey, Ted. - Oh, hiya Glenn. Wait a second, here. Wup! Heeeeey! Peek-A-Boo. I see you. Looks more like you everyday, Ted. Got your hair. - And my eyes. It's Tom Hayden's chin. [woman] Rally, Monday at noon. Thank you. Hey, Leora. Hey, you know that girl went to school with my kids? And when she was little, she had that eyepatch. What do you call it? A lazy eye. That's it. You see the speech? In the papers. I just think about my sons and all these kids out here today. [Ted] You be at the rally Monday? Yeah, I'd like to know what's going on. That's more than I can say for most of our distinguished collegues. Oh, come on, Ted. - Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. My mistake. 1912, in the great state of Ohio. Well, it takes time for The Earth to change. Oh, the geology department, eh? Well, that's the way I see things. No poetry, Ted. Just rocks and minerals. As a matter of fact, when you first came here, you looked like me. Yeah, short hair and a briefcase. Hey, I don't have a briefcase. Yeah, I'm my father's son. [Glenn] What changed you? Chicago. 68. Had to grow my hair long to cover my scar from the riot stick. What about you, Glenn? Where do you stand? Well, you know the white line that runs down the middle of the road? Even after last night? I don't know. [P.A.] The people have the power to rise up and say, "No!" [man] No! Because by saying "no", we're really saying "yes". We're saying "yes" to change, and "yes" to a world of peace, and "yes" to a future that will not be stained by the blood of the innocent. Alright, that's, uh, that's it for today. You're doing terrific. Now, I just want you to say, Come on. - that I'm who? Come on... Sandy. Super. You win. Next week, she sells sea shells by the sea shore. I'll see you Monday. Okay. [man] Guess who. I hope it's Paul Newman. [man] No, it's his double. Oh, Jeff Miller. - Aha. Hi, how ya doin'? Fine. You know there's nothing going on here. I should have gone to Wisconsin or Oberlin, or...something. Was the rally dull? They were pretending to, uh, napalm a little dog. [Sandy] Hmmm. - Hmmm. Maybe I'm just out of it, I don't know, but I don't even know why people go to those things. Only listens. So, what are you doing this weekend? Oh, I'm...gettting married, honeymooning in Rome. Washing my hair. Would you like to come to dinner tomorrow? Yes, I would. Can I, uh, bring anything? Yeah, a 10 pound rib roast okay? Okay. [P.A.] The idea is to let them know we still know the difference, even if they don't. Our next speaker is Jean Arnold, whose husband, Ted, you probably know. She's a T.A. in the English Department, Good luck, Jean! I'm not very good at this. Uh, talking like this. In fact, I'm terrible at it. But after watching it last night, the speech, I had to say something. I have to say something because I ask myself who I am. And the first thing I thought of was, "I'm an American." That was the first. And I am hurt as an American that our country can keep leading us into this heart of darkness we know this war to be. And that's the political part. The personal part and I guess the reason I got up here today is, I'm a mother. My baby's only 8 months old, so things are pretty cool between us. And when he's your age, he'll think his dad and I are full of it because well, that's the law of nature that we grow apart from those who love us the most. But like I say, I am a mother and an American. And I don't care who you are out there. I want you to listen to your children. Please. Just open your hearts and hear them because they are telling the truth. Alright, Jeanie! [man] Okay. What do we want?! [crowd] Peace! - When do we want it!? [crowd] Now! - Peace! Will, where ya goin'? I'm goin' to class. - Oh, what class is that? You know what class. - Oh, ROT-C class? "Today, students, we will learn how to kill and maim." Give it up, Tommy. "Oh, and excuse me, for tonight's homework, I'd like you all to, uh, "to burn down an entire village in the name of true justice and the American..." Look. Remember I am much bigger than you are. Look, you have eyes, you heard her talk, and you're in freakin' ROT-C?! Yeah, and you know why!! - Yeah, okay, alright. You got a ROT-C scholarship. Gimme me a break, I forget sometimes. And now say it. What? - Come on, say "Bill" Bill. Come on, say "Bill"! - Bill, you're not a facist. Come on, like you mean it! - Bill, I swear you're not a facist! Okay. I'll see you when I get back from facist class. Seig heil. [crowd] Ho, ho, Ho chi Minh! NLF is gonna win! Ho, ho, Ho Chi Minh! NLF is gonna win! 1,2,3,4! We don't want your fuckin' war!

Nope, I'm ain't goin' through my high school yearbook pictures. [Bill] See ya. Put it back, twerp. This toaster belongs to the people. Maybe, but it doesn't to you.

This is an illegal assembly! You must disperse! This city is under curfew as of right now! Mayor Satrom. Mayor Satrom. - [man on radio] Standing. Yeah, things are getting out of hand. You gotta get up. What time is it? It's about 3:30. In the morning? Is something wrong, daddy? You okay? Is it mama? No, we're okay, son. I'll talk to you in the morning. I've only had one hour's sleep. You and, uh, Linda have fun? Hmm-mmm. She got a promotion at the drug store. She's sellin' makeup or somethin'. Code, they, um, the captain called. Just tell him I want to sleep. Teamsters thing again, I guess. - Nuh-uh. I'm gonna pass. The address, son, that's all I know. He say what for? You know what for. Yeah, before, they stayed in the Guard, they stay out of 'Nam what's for. Cody. Yeah, Daddy You're a good boy. Hell, look at the size of you. You're a good man. Next...couple of days, when you really get some time, I been meaning to talk to you about the garden this year. thinkin' of peas this summer. Sweet green ones. And tomatoes again, too. The flowers, I leave to your mother. But you and me, we're men. We put the food on the table. Right, son? Ah-ten-SHUN! Right shoulder, arms! Left shoulder, arms! Present arms! On guard! Why you screamin'? Uh, hi. Ma, yeah, hi. I'm sorry about that. Oh, there's nothing wrong with Ploy's. He's on a bad acid trip. Yo ho-oh! No-no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. No, no, I'm fine. No-no, look-look, I didn't even hear about that until this morning. Yeah, uh, my girlfriend told me. Uh, Just this girl I know. Uh, uh, Jessica somethin'. No, uh, yeah, of course I know her last name. Um, Greenwald. - Uh-yeah-uh-uh, Jessica Greenwald is her last name. Uh, huh. Uh, look, mom, I swear to you I am alright. I promise, if anything comes up, I'll give you a call, okay? I'll call you right away. Okay. Yeah, I love you, too. Alright, yeah, I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye. Jessica Greenwald is*m* girlfriend. And it is our job as faculty marshals to not, in any way, try to stop or cause an event to happen. To do what, Glenn? To not, in any way, try to stop or cause an event to happen. Event? - If there is one. Look, has anyone noticed the ROT-C building this morning? They've already smashed a window. I know. - Now look, we all know the R-O-T-C bulding not worth what it cost to tow it away. But it is a symbol of some sort. - I'd like to make a suggestion. And it may be that it's time has come. I mean, already this week they've already tried to torch the ROT-C's at The University of Illinois and The University of Maryland. Our job is with the students, not with the buildings. I want all of us, as people who care about this place and what happens to these kids, to get out and talk to them, that's all. Just let them know we're here. In case. Just in case. In case of what? We're talking generalities, guys. If this was a course, we'd all flunk. We've got to do something. I don't care what it is, but we've got to make some kind of plan, uh, A statement against the war. A position paper, or a caucus with the student leaders, but something. - That'll be hard until we know what the truth is. The truth is we don't know what the truth is here today. The truth is we better watch the hell out. We're trying to find a reasonable approach. These aren't reasonable times, Glenn. Seems reasonable enough this morning, Mr. Arnold. I'll take 15, sir. A lot can come down between now and date 16. I defer to my distinguished junior collegue's experience in these matters and to his colorful use of the venacular. If we could go on? In my day, on a Saturday morning in May, we'd take young ladies out on Moon Lake, tossed a nickel into the water and prayed for a kiss. Not your day, sir. That may be. And we're not, uh, throwing nickels into Moon Lake. We're... talking about saving Kent State. Aren't you being a bit melodramatic? Professor Warren, I've been there. We'll be very lucky if we get away... - So far this morning, we are lucky. Maybe our students behavior on Water Street last night will soon be a bad but distant memory. I hope so. Ladies and gentlemen, may I remind you of the words of Fabius Maximus? Do nothing and hope the enemy fades away. There is no enemy. Who's the enemy in this kind of thing, Professor? Look at Ohio State. Look at Berkeley. Look at Harvard! Will you look around?! No, no. Collect from Allison. Hello? Daddy? Hi. How are you? What do you mean, I sound like I'm all alone? How long, Daddy? What? I know you do. Yeah, uh. Uh-huh. No. No, I wasn't there. I-I just heard about it. I came home early. I didn't want you and Mommy to worry, that's why I called. ♪ Asked if I would remember him. Sure, I think it's bad, making small businessmen suffer and all... Well, look, anyway, Daddy, it's like I've been telling you It'll be good for me to leave Kent, see? Ugh! Yeah, uh, Daddy, could we talk about that later? Yeah. ♪ And all the boys will be sad. I love you. Now tell-tell Mommy the same. I'll call her later, okay? Bye. Alright, bye. My parents. When I talk to them now, I want them to think that I'm this really great, far out, adult person. I always wind up sounding like this little girl. I can't help it. Well, hell. It doesn't look too bad in the light of day, does it? Sir. Uh, we just got a call at the stationhouse. And? From someone we can trust. Says, uh, Says they're going to burn ROT-C tonight, sir. Oh, Ernie, they've been sayin' that ever since I've been on the force. Lieutenant. - Sir. I just spoke to General Delcorso. Yeah? - If you want guard troops, you've got 'til 5 to call Columbus. 'Til 5, sir. Just...hold on. Same source says they're going to pour in tonight, sir. Outside agitators. Going to hit the post office. Going to put LSD in the water supply. LSD? You believe that? You've got 'til 5. Why would they do that? You didn't hear anything? Nuh-uh. I woke up late and my radio's broken. All the windows are smashed. You should see it. The storekeepers are ready to kill the first Kent kid they see. How's that? Don't stop. Oh. There's my mother. Oh. Hi, ma. Must be 300 degrees in that car. Stuck to the seat all the way from Youngstown. Oh, let me look at you. Oh, sweetheart. You remember Sharon, huh, Mom? Daddy and I have been sick worrying. Mom, I'm here. Me. Sandy. So, relax, okay? Hi, Mrs. Scheuer. You keep this one out of trouble for me? - Uh-huh. You're sensible, I can tell. Oh, it's the other way around. See ya later. Bye. You should have seen the traffic. If I had a car... - If you had a car, you could get into a nice accident like your friend there. End up in a hot, sticky brace for 6 months. Brought you summer clothes. Oh, great! You found it! It's very hot. I made tea. Instant? Real. I hate instant. I'll take you to lunch. Can't, Mom. - I drive 30 miles? I have to type this paper for Professor Wydner for Monday, I told you that. And you type, I'll make lunch. You see, you see? Who says parents and children can't communicate? Mwah! I try to be modern. Sure, Mom, make lunch. Actually, I don't make much lunch while you're away. Me, I have a little a little cottage cheese, a little tomato. Which reminds me. Why does cottage cheese remind you of this? I just thought you might find this interesting. Wendy Kuggleman is getting married. So? Isn't that a lovely engagement picture? Gee, Mom, it doesn't do her justice. She doesn't look 4 months pregnant. And he... Does he...I have some, I have to work. Sandy? It's just because we love you. Ma, we'll both make lunch. Uh, yeah, this is, uh, Mayor Leroy Satrom in Kent. We have reason to believe there may be arson. Acts...of...arson on campus tonight. Yes, I'm requesting the National Guard here tonight My men can't handle it. The, uh, curfew's in effect. Hey. This is great. - [Sandy] Thank you. What do you call it? Spaghetti. The sauce! Bottled. Chef Mussolini or something like that. So, anyway, Woodstock. What were you doing on Woodstock, on Saturday? Uh, my cousin's bat mitzvah Okay, um. How 'bout... when Kennedy got killed? Which Kennedy? John. In the girls' gym at school. I lost my retainer and I was crying. Then the gym teacher came in and hugged me and said, "It's all over." I thought she meant I'd never find my retainer again. I don't know. Okay, I have one. Wha... Where were you for the moon walk? Alright, there was a stillway in the council. I went to the other side, The moon men are all green, like in sci-fi books. They all had Ed McMahon's face. - Ew. But, um, anyway, and, and, uh, you know it's all consistant, ya know? I mean, big stuff happens. and it's, it's never where you are. I mean, like, like with last night. I mean, if I ever write my own autobiography, I'm going to call it, uh, "Somewhere Else" Uh, you got any more? Yeah. So, um, what are you doing tonight? Ooh, I have a date. I mean, Not a "date" date. No, no, I got the distinction. I'm meeting a friend. They have a lot of friends. Well, if you're, uh, busy, I guess I'll just hang out. Maybe I'll, uh, see you later on campus. Jeff. - Huh. Thank you for coming to dinner. Well, um, Thank you for cooking it. Thank you for digesting it. Uh, It's, I, It's just that I always have a good time with you, and... You do? Everybody just be quiet for a minute. Everybody just quiet down now. Now, we're out here tonight for a lot of reasons. Reasons like Nixon. Like Kissenger. Like Cambodia. Like the draft. Like because we're all people out here tonight who care, right? Right on! We care that Nixon has sent troops into Cambodia. And we feel that there's something on this campus which stands for a lie. Something on this campus which represents injustice. Something on this campus which is a symbol of all the oppression in the world for which our government is responsible. I think we all know what that something is. Hey! Hut hut! - Hut hut! Bravo! Hey!

Let's try to keep politics in our pockets, alright? Thank you. Hey. Hey, lookit there. Let's talk to 'em. Yeah, separately. How's it goin'? Come on over, Sandy. They don't bite. Sure, we do. Under the right circumstances. Hey, ma'am. Hello. Hey, uh, you know what you look like in that red shirt there? Uh, what? A rose. [Sandy] You guys are really a couple of comedians. No, w-we-we work at Burger Bill's. You ever been there? Wesley here is the fry man. And Cal here does the shakes. You guys care for an orange? Uh, No thank you, ma'am. We can't. Why not? Well, At-at Berkeley, That school out in California, They, uh, students injected LSD into the oranges they gave the guardsmen and The guys went kinda nuts. Well, we just injected these with Sweet and Low. Now, let's just sit down, talk this over quietly. Mr. Govenor. - Not now, son. We're here from the university. President White is on his way back from Iowa. You just let us worry about this. Governor, they're here from the school. You university people, stay out of this. We're taking over this... - Mr. Governor, may I have your attention. If we close down the university and clear all those people out We've got to keep this university open at all costs. To close it down would play into the hands of all the dissident elements that are trying to do just that. Is that clearly understood? [man] Mr. Governor, please, sir. As President White's representative, I insist the university be included in any decisions. Gentlemen, we want to adjourn for five minutes. He'll have plenty of time to answer all of your questions, okay? We decide. Move to the side. Mr. Governor. - Do I know you, young man? Ron Cain, county prosecutor, Portage county. Glad to have you alone, sir. - Glad to*b* alone, if you'll excuse me. Mr. Governor, I think you should close down this freakin' place. No, no, the university, sir, and fast before someone gets shot. You get all those kids and the guard the hell out of there. Then you gradually let things cool down. Get back to normal. There's this old saying we've got in criminal law. I don't want to hear any... - "When blood cools down, "reason resumes control." Well, my blood will cool down. - Because as of now, you've got one hell of a damn hostile situation. You've got a bunch of crazed-up, frightened kids and an exhausted guard. And you don't have to be a freakin' genius to see what comes next. So, you clear everybody the hell outta there and you do it today. Young man, you have a wonderful control of the superlatives. Shut it down and the crazies have won. [reporter 1] Governor, are there undercover agents on the Kent State campus? [reporter 2] Aren't the guard dangerously tired from their duty with the Teamsters? [reporter 3] As a law and order candidate behind in the polls, what do you think your chances are beating Bob Taft in the Tuesday primary? We have seen here, in the city of Kent especially, probably the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by the dissident groups and their allies in the state of Ohio. It ceases to be a problem not the colleges of Ohio. This is now the problem of the*stat* of Ohio. We're going to put a stop to this. - We're going to employ every force of law that we have under our authority. We're going to erradicate the problem. We're not going to treat the symptoms. They only want one thing and that is to destroy higher education in Ohio! These people...just move... from one campus...to the other, then terrorize the community. They're worse than the Brown Shirts and the Communist element and also the Night Riders and the vigilantes. They are the worst type of people we harbor in America! Do we have sufficient numbers of National Guardsmen*an* highway patrol? We have men that are well trained, but they are not trained to receive risks. They won't take it. What will be the response? The next phase that we have encountered elsewhere is where they'll start sniping. [reporter] The students, sir? They can expect us to return fire. When the uh, technic, technique Weathermen and the SDS and the Student Mobilization Committee, when this is employed, and power bombing and violence, let me also say that death is not going to stand in their way in answer to their purposes We are. uh. we are going to employ everything that we possibly can to protect the buildings that are paid for by the taxpayers of the state of Ohio. Let me say this now. No one is safe in Portage county. Just that simple. No one is safe. We're going to disperse crowds.

I'm from Lorain Yeah, I'd probably be in the Guard, too, but, uh... Well, uh, I wanted to go to school. And ROT-C scholarship was the only way I could do it, know what I mean? You know what I learned in ROT-C class last week? Two sticks and a wire. Fastest way to kill a peasant. They teach you that in the Guard? No. Then, hang loose, huh? I saw this last night. You tell me what it means. Well, it's from the, uh, president of the student body and one of the university V.P's. Let's see. "The Governor, through the National Guard, has assumed legal control "of the campus and the city of Kent." Does that mean we're under marshall law? That's what they all think. But there's something missing. There should be a proclamation from the Governor. Ask General Canterberry. But in the Mayor's state of emergency, he said the students could have a peaceful rally. - That's not what Governor Rhodes said. You heard him on the radio. - But he didn't sign this. Do me a favor, Leiutenant. Don't ask questions. Sandy. Just one minute. Didya get it done? Yeah. I never quite get it all done. Let's go. Sharon? - Yeah? What... is it like being gorgeous? Well, you're gorgeous. I mean, what does it feel like? What do you mean? What do I mean? - Yeah. Well, I was just wondering what it must be like not to have to prove yourself all the time. And I thought of you. I feel like I'm always letting people down. I'll carry your books. Why? To help you - I can do it. But your back. I'll survive. - Forget it. No. You having your period? - No. Okay, I'm very sorry I mentioned it. Carry your own books. You don't have to help me. You're my friend. Third company's formed and ready. Thank you, Sergeant. Hut! On! Language is a tool. It is also a gift. Now, uh, right here, right now, this This Monday morning in Kent, Ohio, we face men whose tools are guns. N-now you swear at a man with a gun, and a man with a gun has a great way of swearing right back at you. Remember that. They are, for the most part, uh, deaf to us, these men. Which doesn't mean give up. It, it means, we must guard our gift that much more carefully. Guard it with our lives. Because it-it can make them hear. It can make them see. Maybe, Maybe even understand. And we must understand that it can also work powerfully against us. So we have to make our choice. Language is all we have. It's all we need, if we use it right. And know it for the gift it is. Ah Today's wisdom is from old Gus Flaubert. Uh, language. Language is like a cracked pot on which we beat out rhythms for bears to dance to when we are striving to make music that will wring tears from the stars. Power to the people. Well, they seem orderly enough. Now, sir. It's the last time... - Maybe the tear gas knocked some sense into 'em - I don't know, sir. I wasn't asking what you know. What do you*thin*, Captain? Regulations talk about restraint, sir. Long as we keep 'em in line. - I think we should be prepared, sir. Just be prepared. Yeah, I'll meet you at the Liberty Bell at exactly 11:58, okay? I gotcha. You okay? I'm fine. I slept like a pretzel last night. Ah! Oh, thank you. I got gassed last night, Allison. Me, too. Yeah, only you liked it. - Liked it? Yeah, because it was for something you cared about. I was just standing by my window. - Oh. Don't you care? Yeah, I know I'm supposed to care, but... just like, maybe I'm just too selfish? [Allison] Hey. I'm selfish. Come off. - No, really. And, and Barry is, too. And it's funny that you should say it, 'cause I was sort of thinking about it. About being selfish, and it was like when you love someone, your two...selfishnesses sort of flow together. Right? Um. Am I being completely weird? No, no. No, it's like, out of that is born passion. Oh. Um. Really? - Teargas makes me crazy. Maybe I'm just lonely. - Are you coming to the rally? I'm scared. So am I. Not to mention exhausted. Listen, I don't have a class this afternoon, so I thought maybe I'd stay in. - No maybe, definitely. Talk to the kids, read 'Great Expectations', or something. Just type, okay? Haven't they heard the rally's banned? Hard to tell what they know, sir. It's all yours. Students of Kent State! Students of Kent State! Students of Kent State! We have been invaded!

There are too many of you who are too damned good to die in this stinking field here! I think we should sit down. Sit down! Please sit down! Please, just sit down! Don't run! Sit down! Sit down! Please! Sit down! Please! Cadets! Masks! Prepare to fire gas! Stand by! In the name of God, don't come any closer! My orders are to move ahead. We have got to have a little time! They're going to have to find out what 'law and order' means. General, give us time! Five minutes. I don't care whether you've never listened to anyone before in your lives. I'm begging you right now! If you don't disperse right now, they're going to move in! And it could only be a slaughter.
