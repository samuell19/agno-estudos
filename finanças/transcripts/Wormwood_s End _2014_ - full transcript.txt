- The name of the star is Wormwood and a third of the waters turned bitter and many people died from the waters that had become bitter. My name is Alan Burrows, founder of the Wormwood Militia. I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold, I am alive forever and hold the keys of hell and of death. Welcome to Camp Wormwood. Enjoy your stay. - I'm sorry about this, Jacob. - I'm not dead, daddy. - Wait a minute. I'm not dud? I'm not dud? I'm not dead? Jacob, you're not dead. We're gonna go on a little trip. - All right, Zep, punch the clock. Hey, you want for this? - No. This is tight quarters. We'll just use the side arms. Let's just get this radiator clamped and get the hell out of here. Got it. The last one. - Hear that? - Oh, I'm not freakin' deaf. Do you hear that? Speak. - Please. - Pretty, pretty. - So, got a name? I'm Sully. That's to whatever. I'm next town, yup, born and raised, Yes ma'am... - Shut up. - What's that? - Shut up. - You know, I just get the idea maybe be nicer, maybe even grateful, I don't know. - So what? I should let you and your douche bag friend double team me to show my gratitude? - I never said that. - You don't have to. You're men, you're pigs. - Well, shows how much you know. I don't share with this douche bag. Not clean. - Sully, you asshole. I heard that. Funny, guys. Besides herpes is just. - Tammera. - What's that? - That's my name, Tammera. - Oh. - Come on, give me a gun. Sully, give me a gun, give me something. - Get back in the Jeep. I didn't tell you to get out. - I'm not staying in there. Give me a gun. Look, two seconds. I'm gonna shoot these two. We're gonna be on our way, okay? - No, I should be your back up 'cause I think I have a good shot and if they hurt you, I could save you. You could save me? - Yeah, why do you laugh? I'm serious, Sully. This is not cool. I should have a weapon, or a gun, or a tool... - They are here. Take the gun. Here, take the gun. You shoot 'em, fine. Yeah, shoot them. You have my gun. You want to? Biggest, don't be so pissed off. I have nothing. This isn't fair. And you have other things, like you should give me that thing. - You're pissing me off. It smells like shit. - Do you hear that? Oh, that stinks so bad. Shoot it. - Wait, I want to see what happens. - Get your hands in the air! Lance, get the weapons. - Cowboy, drop the bat now! Now! Cue ball, slowly hand me your weapon handle first! No funny moves. Don't be a hero. - What the hell is that? - I don't know, Courtney Love. - Move! - Well, I founded Camp Wormwood in June of 1995, bringing in the most resourceful of survivalists to cultivate my vision. I knew that sooner rather than later, Camp Wormwood would be the last vestige of humanity. And I looked, and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death. Revelations 6:8. Out of the car! Hands up in the air, turn around! Don't look at me! Hands behind your head! - I don't have a good feeling about this, Sully. Sully? Sully? Hands up on your head. - Yip yip! What do we got here? What do you three folks think you're doing out here? Yo, Baldy, how about stepping on out? Show me your hands. - Don't shoot. - Open that door nice and slow. - Careful out there, Sully. - Hey, no talkin' in there. I'll get to you in a minute there, boy. Close that door nice and slow. Hey, I said slow. Don't you know how to pay attention, Baldy? Am I gonna have to rough you up? Keep your hands there. Passenger, step on out. Come on, ain't got all day. There we go. Nice and steady, nice and steady. Don't you know smoking's bad for your health there, boy? - Yeah, so are assholes with guns. - You know I oughta beat you down right here, don't you? Quit staring at me. Put your hands up against that there Jeep. - Zep, shut up and put your hands on the Jeep. - Ma'am, step on out now nice and slow. Don't want to have to hurt your pretty little face there. Keep your hands where I can see 'em too. Because you're a female don't mean shit. Step right between the both of 'em. I'ma pat you three down, make sure yins are unarmed. You already took everything we had. Well, we still gotta make sure now, don't we, smart ass? - So, what do you suppose is going on around here? - I don't know. Maybe they're taking us to meet the big shit. - Do any of you know who I am? - I know you. You're Mr. Shit. Classic line from an old film, "Barbarosa," starring Willie Nelson. - Wait a second. You're Max, right? - You knew Max? - Yeah, we met a few months ago. - No, I'm Marcus. Max is my brother. - Well, what happened to Max? - He's here with us, Mr. Richards? I'm sorry, Doctor Richards? Good, we could use a doctor here. The door ofWormwood opens. We welcome you. - Good. Now, you three however, have not proven your worth. One of you is gonna have to take the test. - What test? Beast, beast, beast, beast, beast! - One of you is gonna have to fight the beast. - In my day, we didn't have self esteem, we had self respect, and no more of it than we deserved. Camp Wormwood is not a free meal. If you want to stay, you take the test. - Wormwood can be summed up in one word, tradition. Now, the men standing behind you, they have all proven their worth here. Now, you can be welcomed in as a group. That just means that one of you gotta fight the beast. So, who's it gonna be? - Not it. - What if I respectfully decline? Can we just go? - No. We will shoot you. - I guess I'll do it. - All right, good. Bring out the beast! Beast, beast, beast, beast, beast, beast! Beast, beast, beast, beast, beast, beast, beast! - I'm gonna rip your spinal cord out and go through the top of that bald head of yours to get it! - Oh Sully, pay attention! - Come on, Marcus. What is this shit? - Marcus, this is bullshit! - I never said you couldn't use weapons. - Oh, Foster, a dead kid! - Wahoo, Marcus, we got a dead kid here. - Yip yip! - Doc, what's the story here? - It's okay. It's just my son Jacob. He won't hurt anybody, I swear. - I'll stick him in the pen. - No, he's family. He goes to the barn with Max. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Max is dead? - Yeah. Stepps, put him in the barn with Max. - Wait, wait, take it easy, take it easy. - Easy, Stepps, he's a kid. - Whatever, you do it. This guy's a real. Yeah, Stepps, come on, come on, yeah. - Stepps, Franko. - Yeah, yeah. - This shit ends. Perry, put that kid in the barn with Max. - Listen, Marcus, we have to talk. There's been a new development. - Okay, talk. - In private. - All right, give us 10 minutes. - What the hell's the matter with you, kid? Yip yip. - I purchased the abandoned town ofWormwood and we set up camp using the ramshackle buildings. There were to be no repairs, no new construction. I wanted the old ways to decay along with the buildings so that the men of Wormwood create a new way. - Hey man, this is bad, bad, bad every which way you cut it. These things are dangerous. - Calm down, Franko. These things have been dangerous since what, the first one showed up two years ago? - Yeah, well I got news for you, okay? Head shots, they don't work anymore. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about head shots, they don't work. - Hm. Well, that's something new. - Think of it in these terms. These zombies, they're nothing more than larva moving around to nourish the growing organism inside. - You were with Max? - He came to my home with three others. - My brother Mike, was he there? - He was. - Where is he? - He's in my garage. - What? - Well, Max shot him. He got bit. I wrapped his body and I laid him in my garage. I'm sorry, Stepps. - I'll call off the search. - We need to talk about this new zombie. - You did pretty good out there, Sully. - Yeah, Sully, not bad. Oop, sorry, man. Tender? - Sully! - Give us a kiss, sugar. - Do it, Arturo! Give it to her! She wants it, give it to her. She wants it. She's gonna take it, you're gonna give it to her. - Hey, you okay? - No way. - Arturo, Arturo, Arturo? - We have to forget the idea these things are zombies, Marcus. Two weeks ago, I extracted living tissue from one of them. They're not dead inside. They're generating new tissue. - What's that mean, they're alive? - Alive and growing. And believe you me, the dead were bad, these are worse. Yeah, so listen, tomorrow, I'll show you the pens and the corrals and everything, all right? - Corral for what? - You'll see tomorrow. Get some sleep. You earned it. - You sure are getting awful chummy with those guys. Yup, making some new friends... - Here it comes. - Maybe kissing a little... - Blow me, Zep, okay? I'm just going with the flow, that's all. - I don't like it here. I don't get a good vibe. - You guys, relax. I mean, I haven't drank the Kool Aid yet. The only two I really trust here are Franko and maybe the doc. - Why? - I don't know, they're different. I mean, the rest of these guys are a bunch of monkeys on sticks. - Come on, Sully. Okay, whatever you say. Oh no, Sully, I cannot do any more canned foods. - Sorry, sunshine. It's tough to get a steak in the apocalypse. - So gross. All right, so tell me your story. Is there a missus Sully out there? - Oh yeah, a missus and a junior. Yeah? - Yup. How about you? You got a guy out there melting your butter? - There was, is, was. - Huh? - There is. It's a long story. Anyway, I noticed you don't have a ring on. Were you not married? - Oh yeah, no. Got it right here. - Why don't you wear it? - The idea of that ring ending up in the belly of one of them things out there if something happened. Check it out, while we're talking about it, our lives. - Aw, Sully. She's beautiful. That's Stacey. - She's really beautiful. Your kid? - You're looking at it. She's pregnant. Yeah? - Yeah, I never got to see him born. - What happened? - When this all happened, me and Giuseppe, we were out in the country. We were working. We worked together. It took us about three hours to get back to town and by the time we got back, it was pretty bad. We finally got back to the apartment and the National Guard had come in and evacuated everybody. But she left a note saying where she went. It was a rescue station. She writes notes to me. She signs her name. She doesn't sign her name. She always draws a little rabbit. And even with all that going on, she took the time to draw the rabbit. - What the hell is that? - Punch your clock, Zep. - Let's go check it out. - What the hell's going on, guys? - That thing we saw when we found you, the damn thing cleared a nine foot fence, right over, no problem. - A different one? - Yeah. - Is it still moving? - Not anymore. - Have a good night, ladies. - Make a hole. Home sweet home. - I don't suppose anybody would mind if I took that cot. - Now, Sully, you wouldn't begrudge a girl just the simplest of creature comforts now, would you? - Come on, Sully. It looks like it's the floor for us. - A guy walks into a bar, he's got an alligator under his arm. The bartender says, "What can I get you?" The guy says, "Do you serve politicians?" The bartender says, "Yeah." The guy says... - What's that about? - Every night he starts that joke and he's asleep before the punchline. - Hm. That's kinda weird. - Why don't you feed 'em? - They're watching them. See the tags? Yeah, that's very perceptive, doctor. The tags actually represent the dates of their decay. - What for? - They're watching 'em rot. - That's right, Sully. We're trying to see how long they're gonna stay mobile, see how long they last, 'cause that way, we can determine how long they're gonna be a threat. They're always a threat, Sully. And none are pets, Marcus. - See now, Franko here has been opposed to the pens since day one. He's our camp skeptic, as it were. But he's a good and useful man. Now, some of the other guys are going on a treasure hunt. I want you to take these two guys with you. - Hey, guys. Sully? Hey, guys, where are we going? - Hey, Tammera. - Hi, where are we going? - We're going out and you're staying here. - No, nuh-uh, I'm not. I'm going with you. - Look, Tammera, I just talked to Marcus, okay? And the rules are the women cannot go out with the men. You have to stay back. - Rules. Come on. - He wants you to help the women. - No. - Tammera, there are 50 militia men here and they have the rules regarding women, and we have to abide by those. And stay the hell away from the back of the compound. There's a pen back there with 20 zombies in it. - Why would you leave me with the zombies? Come on, Giuseppe. - Sorry, sweetie. - It's not my call, it's Marcus, okay? He runs this place and I don't have time for this. - Okay. - We gotta go. - Okay. You men have a good time. Have fun. 'Cause I'm gonna stay here with the women because apparently these are at the wrong end. And I'm gonna go do women things because I'm a woman! I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna do woman things with the zombies. Thank you! Assholes! - Camp Wormwood was a gift to my nephews Max and Marcus. Their father, my brother, was instrumental in the downfall of mankind, a key player with the chem lab corporation. It's poignant that I should be the one to rebuild humanity. And the nations were angry and your wrath has come. The time has come to judge the dead and to reward your servants, the prophets, and your people who revere your name both great and small, and for destroying those who destroy the earth! Revelation 11:18. - Yeah, it's a good bet we find some materials for the creeper cage here. - Yip yip. - Perry, why don't you take Sully inside, run a little shopping spree, see what you can find. Giuseppe and I will root around out here, see if we can find some fencing, but let's make it fast and then get out of here. - All right, let's do this. - What you doing over here? - You scared me. I was, sorry, I was just checking things out. - Checking things out? That's what you do in your spare time? - I was exploring. - Exploring. Well, the girls need help with the laundry so I think you should get your ass over there. - Laundry? - Laundry. Yeah, Barbie doll. Come on. - Whose laundry are we doing? - It doesn't matter, does it? Why? - What are you? - So, Franko? - Yeah? - It seems to me that you and Marcus aren't cut from the same cloth. - Yeah, well every man's made different. - Yeah, well, the two of you just seem to have really different ideas, that's all. - It's a cruel world. It makes you do cruel things to survive. You do those things, sometimes you slide away from humanity into the abyss. - Have you said anything to Stepps or any of the other guys? - No. In a lot of ways, Stepps is worse off than Marcus. - Worse, how do you mean? - Let's just say you go against the grain here, Giuseppe, it's bad for your health. - Franko, is this your way of being discreet? - Simply said, discretion's the better part of valor. - Shakespeare. - Huh? - William Shakespeare? - Yeah, I don't know, man. Look, all I know is no one's ever left Wormwood alive. Keep your eyes open. Come on. Yip yip! - Damn it, Perry. - You noticed? - No, what? - Me and Zep picked up a guy about a week ago. He got bit. That's when I noticed. Turning a lot quicker now. - Yip yip. - How long do we have to do this? - 'Til it's done. - You're Angel, right? - Yeah. - You know, I didn't get your name. - 'Cause I didn't give it to you. And get back to work. - Why do you gotta be such a bitch, Donna? I know, right? - You know I have to. It's the only way to protect yourself here. - Just because they treat us like shit doesn't mean we have to treat each other that way. - You run, you run now, get out. - What are you talking about? - I didn't mean it this way. No, they'll look at this as treason. Don't do this. - Take your chances with the zombies. This is no place for a woman. Just run. Get as far away from here as you can. - What? - I came here with two men, my husband and my brother. They adjusted us to camp and then eventually, they told my husband and brother they have to give me over to the other men. They didn't agree. They were killed and then fed to the zombies. Now, I'm a slave here. You run, you run now. - Well, well. Aren't we getting a little cozy in here? Get up, get up! Stop it! - Get off! Let's go! No, get outta here! Get out! Let me go! - Donna, you've been charged and convicted of treason and sentenced to die in the pen. Do you have any last words? - Please, Marcus, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I slipped. It will never happen again, I swear. I swear, please. - Okay, on with it then. No, no, no! Marcus! I die today! You, you die tomorrow! - Let her out. Your point is taken. Let her out. Stop, stop this! Let her out! Stop it! What's wrong with you people?! You're monsters! Stop! No! No! Stop! Please, please, please! No! No! Stop! - Huh. This is weird. - Indeed. - Marcus. - What's going on, doc? What can you tell me about this guy? - It happens all the time. Don't worry. Well, these guys after the change are mostly nervous system, probably the biggest most advanced nervous system ever. This one is loaded with it. I'm starting to put together a pretty scary theory here, Marcus. This new species? They're gonna have a hive mentality. They're gonna act as one, connected like a beehive. If this is true, they're gonna swarm the earth like a plague that no man has ever seen. - Have you determined why it's so hard to kill these things now? - Multiple brains. Many brains, hundreds of them. It's located throughout the legs, the torso, the arms. - Well then, what's in the head? - Glad you asked that. What is that shit? - It's just a rotted human brain. It appears to liquefy when they turn into these things. Oh, gee. - So, Danny, what do you think of the new pretty brunette? I think she's a whore. - I think you're right, Danny. Tough guy. Hey asshole, I'm talking to you. - What? - Why don't you be a sport and tell us how she likes it? - Sully, I need to talk to you. - Okay. - Fuck. - Arturo, Danny! Latrine pots need burned! - Aw, come on, Stepps. - Arturo! Do it and do it now! - To be continued. - Thanks, Sully. I gotta go. - Hey, Sully. Are you seeing Tammera? - I don't know, Zep. There's something going on. - Like what, you think? - I don't know, like maybe Tammera's getting segregated. - Hey Sully, where are you going? - Checking on the princess. Tammera! Yo, Tammera! Hey, Sully. - Sorry, Marcus, I am a little jumpy. - What did you used to do before all this? - I was a carpenter, a good one. I used to build houses. It seems like such a long time ago. - She really has no idea, does she? - No. Arturo and Danny are tonight. - Oh no. They're the worst. It's gonna be a bad night for the new girl. - I remember my first night. I need to tell... - Stop it! - You saw what they did to Donna. They'll do the same to you if you're caught. - Angel, speak English... - I said you're a stupid girl with no common sense. - No one says anything to her. - What is this place? - This is the main building, at least that's what most of us call it. Some of the guys call it the hen house. But it's where the women do most of the work and they actually sleep in the back of it. - It smells a little bit like slavery, Marcus. - All in the old world, Sully. Hey, you drink scotch? - Yes, I do. - Let's go have a drink, man. There's something I want to talk to you about. - What's up, Franko? - Yeah, what's up, Giuseppe? No, I'm good. Thanks. Hey look, I want to talk to you, man to man. - Okay. - Yeah, well, I kinda feel you and Sully are good men, you know? - I guess. I mean, I do all right and you saw Sully in action earlier today. - No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean I'm just gonna come out and say it. I feel like you guys are pretty honorable, you know? I feel like I can trust you. Can I trust you? - Come on, Franko. What is all this? - Look, man, can I trust you? - Yeah, you can trust us. Then again, doesn't even the most low-life think he's trustworthy? It is all about perception, ain't it? - Yeah, well, I guess you got a point there, big daddy. - What is it? What's this all about? - I'm just gonna tell you. I'm getting out of here. - What, from Wormwood? - Yeah, yeah, from Wormwood. And I know you don't understand right now 'cause the whole world's falling apart on the outside, but there's things happening here you have no idea. Bad things. - That's good scotch. - Yeah, right? We were able to hold on to some of the old luxuries that we used to enjoy. So, how do you like it here? - Well, it sure beats kicking around on the outside, I can tell you that. Marcus, I kinda get the feeling I'm being greased up here. What's on your mind? - Well, how well do you know that girl that you showed up with? - Tammera? I just met her a couple days ago. There's just something about her. - Men, they lose their humanity in places like this. You understand? - Well, why haven't you just left? - What, alone? Are you crazy? Man, alone on the outside, you're like a kitten in a crocodile pit. Alone, you're dead. But you, me, Sully, man, the three of us, we can handle some shit. We could watch each other's backs. We can survive. - So, do you have a plan? - Of course I have a plan. Look, I'm gonna show you something. You see this here? This is where we're at. This is building number eight, okay? Now, behind building number eight, there's a little four by four access panel, okay? The last couple weeks, I've been stashing shit back there, okay? All kinda stuff. - Like what? - Man, supplies, you know? Water, first aid, MREs. - Extra rounds? - Yeah, of course, extra rounds. Okay, but listen, they're gonna take inventory soon, okay? And when they do, they're gonna see a whole bunch of stuff's missing. So if we're gonna do this, we gotta do it now. - Sounds good, man. Let's get Sully, Tammera, get the fuck outta here... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow your roll, cowboy, okay? You, me, Sully, yes. Tammera, no. - What you talking about? - Look, man. I know you don't understand right now, but the minute she stepped here, the minute she came to Wormwood, she became a liability, man. She's Wormwood's property now. You understand? - Sully ain't gonna like this. - Yeah, well, that's his problem. - Well, the women here at Camp Wormwood perform a very unique function. Outside of their day to day chores, they subscribe to otherwise discreet behavior. - I don't follow you, Marcus. - All right, well, I'm not gonna even try to sugarcoat it for you. The women here serve as a reward system, so the better the men perform, they get their choice of whatever girl they want. - For sex? - Well, you know, for whatever. And I don't have to tell you. Tammera is a beautiful girl and she's gonna be highly motivating for the men. She'll be very popular. And in addition to your cooperation, we're gonna make you an officer of the camp just like Franko and Stepps. - And what would I have to look forward to being an officer of Camp Wormwood? - You get better food, better drink, you get to stay in better quarters. And also, we can get you some of the old luxuries that our foraging expeditions can acquire for you. - You got a deal. - What about your friend Giuseppe? - Oh, don't worry about him. Marcus, he'll do whatever I tell him to do. - You got a deal. - You got a deal. We can hash out the details in the morning. - Yeah. - Marcus, I am beat. I'm gonna turn in. It's late. That, sir, sounds like a grand plan. I'm right behind you. Okay. - Talk to you tomorrow, Sully? - Don't count on it, asshole. - Aw, have a bad day, bitch? Grab her. - No, no, no. - Stop! - You okay, Sully? - I'm gonna need a minute. - Don't, don't touch me. - We're getting out of here, okay? - Jacob, what are you? - I'm new. There will be many more like me. - What in God's name are you? - New. - New, as in recent of origin or existence? - Negative. New is the name of my species. You are human, I'm new. Humans are the food of devils. And devils are the food of my species. We must go now. - How do you feel, Sully? - Like somebody nailed my coffin lid shut. - What? - Nothing. - Where are we going? - Building eight. Franko's been there, he's got some gear together. We're gonna get the hell outta here. - Hey! - Sorry. - What are you doing out here?! You're not allowed out here! - Sorry. - What do you think you're doing?! - Sorry, Stepps. - You want to end up in the pen?! Stepps, I'm sorry. - Do ya?! - No! - Huh?! - I'm sorry. - Max, what are you doing out? I love you, brother. Sully, come in. This is Sully, over. Oh good, you're not dead, over. - That's a weird thing to say. Not from where I'm looking. - What's up, doc? I'm kind of in the middle of something here. Those things are headed towards the camp. - Yeah, they're already here. Are you getting out? Where are you? I'm on the outskirts. I'm safe. I've got Jacob and we're leaving. - All right, good luck, doc. Good luck to you all. You're gonna need it. Over and out. - He's there. How do we get over? - We run. - We picked one hell of a night to do this. - Give them the rundown. - All right, so check it out. I picked building number eight 'cause it's the closest to that fence, all right? There's a breach in the fence about halfway out. We're gonna mosey outta here like quiet little kittens, okay? And we're not gonna be spotted. - I suggest we go now while those things are busy with the men. - Let's giddy it up then. - All right, let's do it. - All right. - Sully, wake up. - Come on. - The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains. And said to the mountains and the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of he that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come, and who shall be able to stand? - Sully, you're so quiet. Come on, Sully, talk to me. - You see that treeline? - Yup. - Over those trees is Highway 90. We should we able to get transport there. The highway's jammed up with cars. - Engage me. Give me some human interaction. Why don't you tell me the rest of that damn joke? - If the highway's all jammed up, how are we gonna get past it? - We'll get a four wheel drive vehicle and ride the medians. - Good idea. - You know, Sully, if you keep ignoring me like this, you are never gonna get in my pants. Come on, Sully. How'd this happen? - When Arturo stuck him. Why didn't you tell me?
