Isn’t he up yet? You go check. He’s never in a hurry to go to school. Because the school is nearby, he doesn’t wake up before 11 am. Let him sleep. I checked, he was studying till very late in the night. The bathroom’s light was still switched on around midnight. Studying, was he? He’s stuck to the phone like a leech! I warned you not to buy him a phone before the board exams. I’ve to buy grocery today. We spoke about it. No chatting, no Facebook, nothing before exams! Only music is allowed! But what is all this now! No! I must call him. Let me call him here. You’re calling him on the phone? It’s alright! - I’ve nothing to say then! Like father like son! But... Oh God! The phone! Baba, I’m up! Anu, get ready, we’re leaving together! Great, it’s done! Yes! Download complete! There’s only 25 MB data left?! Great! Already at it? Don’t you have school?! Get up now! Why do I need to coax you so much to get ready for school? Get up! Eww! How can you use this? I’ve to wash it today! Now go take a shower! I’ve to leave, you know! And... I have to go at Grand Mother's home. to bring your Grand Maa... She’s coming. She will stay for some days! Didun is coming?! Yay! Great fun, huh? Now go for your shower! Told you not to kiss me before brushing your teeth! Why do you forget to take this one before breakfast? Here. While coming back from work pick us up from that house. Please sit! It gets locked sometimes! You must take rest! Look at yourself Have you and your son let me sit back in the last 15 years? I bother you a lot, isn’t it? Go stay in that house for some days. The workload will be double when I’m back. Good morning! - Morning. Didn’t you bathe? - Done! Now finish this and oblige me. - Oh sure! Finish this. Did you bathe? Baba, the films you gave me, they’re awesome! You liked them? - Yes. And that one’s the best... ‘The Quick and the Dead’ ‘The Quick and the Dead’ I will give you more interesting films when you grow up. Very interesting ones. 'Wild Strawberries' 'Meghe Dhaka Tara' 'Seventh seal' 'Casablanca'. Ah... Such beautiful films! I was watching it on Arko-da’s laptop 'Wild Strawberries' Did'nt liked them much. Obviously. You’ll like it when you grow up a little more. Not for your age. The short films you made are weird. I don’t get them. That is all amateur work. From my younger days. I used to appreciate those earlier. Now I find them funny. Why don’t you make a film now? I will. There was a time I used to think I’ll make a career in films. But... ...for whatever reasons that didn’t happen. But I will surely make a film. And before everything else, I will buy a good camera! Isn’t the one you have good enough? No...that’s outdated now. Baba, you promised to teach me how to handle a camera. Yes, I will. Before that you must take this exam seriously. No Facebook, no chatting, okay? It’s already late! Okay, I’m done! What? What a gorgeous... Ugh! Oh, Radha, she is my life! Oh, Radha, I belong to you! I won’t survive away from you! Oh, Radha, she is my life! Oh, Radha, I belong to you! Hey, Mr. Anal! Where’ve you been? Going to a different shop these days? No... I have new stock. Triple X collection! - Quiet! I’ll see you after school. Oh yes! And now I have my own brilliant collection! Fine? Ah! So you’ve been downloading now? But that’s expensive. And the files are smaller. Right? Better you buy it from me.. Full HD! How big is your memory card? 16GB! Listen kid, I have eternal GBs! Okay! - I’ll see you after school! Done? - Deal! Okay, bye! Oh, Radha, she is my life! Oh, Radha, I belong to you! I won’t survive... Hey! What is it? Your bag...Your bag! Mobile! Yes? Oh no! Buddy! What will happen now!? Hey! It’s a complete massacre! Surely they’ll call your parents! I had just downloaded it. Didn’t even get a watch it... What if he deletes it? Oh no. He won’t 'delete' you. But he may 'D Litt' you! He will cut you off! My God! A school boy watching porn?! Why? This is the apt age. Adolescence period. Periods? For a male? - ‘Adolescence period’! Puberty... Haven’t you read Freud? Child Psychology? You’re not qualified for teaching. - Don’t you dare say that! Are you’re supporting this? - Exactly! This is an educational institution! What is all this! You don’t think sex education is a part of the curriculum? The problem is at the root itself No. Porn and sex education aren’t the same! As in, sex education is... Shh! Keep your voice low! It’s not ‘sex’! We’ll be in trouble if the Headmaster hears this! Why is that? Sex! Trouble! Why? You’ve a problem with the word, ‘Sex’? You will find the word everywhere! Even when you’re filling up a form, you’ve to put a tick beside that word... ...‘F’ or ‘M’? Starting from government ads... that word is used everywhere. O really? So you mean now we should screen porn for the students? That’s not what I meant. Look, in the western countries they teach this subject. But in India or West Bengal the term ‘sex education’ creates a pandemonium! This is the root of all the problems. The frequent rapes, eve teasing, everything is due to the lack of awareness. Hmm... You mean people rape because they’re unaware? Yes, at least in our country that is one of the primary reasons. But if you look at the west... - Sir... ...this is not the West. This is India. Rather, West Bengal! Then what will say about ‘Badshayon’ or ‘Khajuraho’? Oldest examples of our country... Or if you read ‘From Volga to Ganga’? You’ll find a mother teaching her child sex education. You’re still confusing between porn and sex education. Right. I am. But the source is the same. That kid’s interest in sex is due to his age... and you can’t deny that. Instead of a scolding or punishment, proper counselling is required. Okay. You should take that responsibility then. I can’t even imagine this. Naturally. Have you seen this stuff? This is nothing but perversion. And this is not porn. Huh? Yes! And definitely not sex education! is that so? Do one thing. Share it with me. Okay... are you on Xender? - Yes. Wait. I’ll join. Create it. Okay. Why... share it with me too then? Why do you look startled? You said... ‘Perversion’ right? Let me check it out? Very well then! What shame! No one in our family has been involved in such scandals ever! Why!? Haven’t we done enough to make you happy? What kind of company do you keep? Do you have friends from the slum?! Calm down! Didn’t you even think about the status of your parents? Don’t scream like that. That, rather would derogate our status. O really? You mean it is my mistake? Is that so? Fine then! I won’t say another word then! Not a word...?-Listen... Why then did you not go to school when they called? Why did I have to face the shameful situation? Why must I face this?! Krishna! Quiet now. All the blame is on me now! Enough now. Calm down. In front of so many people... You know what the Headmaster told me? Do you do it front of him? - Oh please spare me, please stop! ‘Please stop’? Embarrassed, are you? Why did you send me instead? Anal... ...come to my room after dinner. Eat, son. Come on? Hey... what are you staring at? I’ll pull your eyes out! Shamelessly looking me in the eye?! Sit. All of us have certain secrets. Like your mother. Your Grand Mother. Me... You have to nourish that secrets. Yes. And that is very personal. Our own to call. There’s a beautiful relationship you share with your privacy. But... ...the moment it comes out in the open... As in when other people come to know about it... ...then it turns ugly! Become scandal. Because the rest of people don’t share... ...that beautiful relationship with your privacy. No sentiments is there. Hope you understand, huh? Am I clear? Good. Look. You’re growing up. You’ve both boys and girls in your freind-list. You naturally feel attracted towards girl-freind, towards sex! I know because I’ve been through your age. But this attraction you’re feeling, you must protect it from everyone else. We... We all have such secret chapters in our lives. A secret box. And in that secret box you keep your privacy. You keep all the little things that you like and love... Things that you hold close to your heart. Some people... ...maintain a diary. Some keep old cards, letters... Big and small, all kinds of memories. It’s to be kept in that private box I too have one. Wait... Come. This is my secret box. My own to call. All the times I fell in love since childhood... crushes and little affairs... Memories... It’s all locked up in here. You can’t share this stuff. You must not. If you do; its essence vanishes into thin air like camphor. V A N I S H! Vanish! You must spend time with them. When you do, the world opens up to you in its own way. Get it? But none of us know what will happen to these boxes when we’re no more. What happens to this privacy? Even then, we keep it private. You know what the problem is, Anal? The environment your generation is growing up in... ...it is... believes in expressing each day, each moment has an expression! Today I watched a film, today I ate Puchkas... Today I fell in love... ‘With 49 others’! Running after likes and comments on Facebook statuses... there’s nothing left of your own. But one day will come when you... Realise your own self. You will discover your own world then. And that day, you will see... Go. Sleep in your room. Who spotted the body first? Sir, it was me. I came to dump garbage in the morning. No, Sir. I spotted it first and told him. Hmm... Both of you come to the police station with me. Sir, hope we’re not in trouble? You see I have kids. Sir, me too! Stop talking crap! Is there a motor garage nearby? Yes, Sir! There are three of them. Three? - Yes... Take me there. Come, Sir. - Coming... Coming... Wait... I am coming... Hello, good morning Auntie. Is Anal home? Yes. There’s no school today... He’s upstairs. Hey, get up! Come on! Hey! Get up! What the... You know what time it is? What are you doing here so early? Early? It’s 11 AM! And it is my birthday, you’ve forgotten that too! Everyone else wished me! My Mom has invited you home in the evening. Hey, sorry! I completely forgot! Happy birthday... Eww! Look... basically I got a nice scolding... ...yesterday. Forgot in the middle of it. Good for you! I warned you not to watch that stuff so much... now suit yourself! Don’t act innocent! You too ogle at it when I show you! Then you cringe when it is over! I know you girls! Don’t you dare lie! I don’t watch all that rubbish! You force me to! - Really? And don’t you dare compare me with other girls. I am different! Look at you... you girls ?always create a huge fuss. Besides, there’s porn in your name itself! Ever noticed? P.O.R.N.O. ! Porno! Do you realise, Porno? I’m sure you’re dad planned it like that! Porno! Anal! Your name too spells really funny! - Why, what’s there in my name? A N A... L! You’re smart, eh? You... And I was talking about ‘Porno’! Hey! Fish fingers! Father has arrived. One minute! Where’s the remote? Remote? Give it to me. - What happened? Now go. Why do you take time to open the door? Happy Birthday, honey! My gift? Sorry, I forgot today, I’llget it later, okay? No, I want it today! Today itself? Alright. Don’t touch my laptop ever again! Laptop!? For me? Laptop! A new laptop! Unpack it! Open the gift pack... The remote? Is this a party song? Now that’s a party song! Uncle’s in good mood today! I got a laptop! What happened? Everything okay? Didn’t watch the news? - No. Was busy cooking today. What happened? Three men raped a little girl and dumped her in the dustbin. How old will she be... Must be Porno’s age... I noticed motor stains in her clothes and raided the local garages... Three of them... started running when they saw the police. I caught two of them. One got away. If you’ve made any fries, get it. It’s her birthday, her friends are here, why drink today? Do as told. What? Get going! I won’t do it again! Rape, eh? - I won’t do it again! Please let me go! Never again, Sir! Please let me go! Please forgive me... - Rape eh? What are you doing there? Nothing. What is it? - Nothing. Won’t you sleep? What... - No. You go sleep. Where’s our girl? - She slept long back. Slept off? Why? Without wishing me goodnight? She came to wish you. Her friends came to say bye too. You were mumbling something to yourself alone. You get drunk very easily these days. Should I get you the dinner? No. I’m not hungry. You won’t eat? No. Why do you need to watch this rubbish every night? You don’t even look at me? these days... Come here. Watch this. She’s Russian! Look at her boobs... Her waist... Her bum! And now look at yours! Like a barrel! Go, sleep. Should’ve married someone like her. Don’t make me lose my temper now. Sleep. Sleep! I know very well... That you guys called me 'Mr. Porn' behind my back! But... ...But but but! I don’t mind. - No, Panu-da... ...Pinaki-da, not us, Dabbu da calls you so. No, Gubla does! - I told you! I never mind. - Okay. You people want stuff. I supply you with it. That’s all. Business. Here you go! Great! - 16 GBs of amazing collection! Wonderful! I am going to keep the files hidden or else they may catch me at home. Getting caught in school was? an accident. ‘School’ as an idea itself is stupid. If you’re to spill everything to the parents, then why do we pay you? Exactly! Did you go to school? - Excuse me!? Did you go to school? Till 8th standard. Lost interest? after that... School is very stupid place! Why must I study Sher Shah’s Administrative system? They teach you unnecessary things. Those things are meant for the parliament. Far better an option is Kishore Kumar’s songs! Songs? But songs don’t have education in them! - Oh sure they do, kid! They’ve got education, questions and? answers and everything! Let’s hear one then! Yes! Let’s! - Just one song. A song with questions. What just happened?! Question number 1? - One. How did it happen? Plus 1! - Plus 1! Okay? When did it happen? Plus 1! Why did it happen? - Plus 1? Plus 2. Okay. - Of course Plus 2! ‘Why did it happen’, it's score 2. Now for the answers! - Yes, answers. It happened... when it had to. Oh chuck it, don’t think about it! What just happened?! Now a work education song, okay? Okay, tell me, how does love happen? Love? A girl and a boy... - Wrong answer! You tell me! - Through a Facebook profile picture What! Come again!? - Through Facebook pictures! No! You tell me! How does it happen? You too have the wrong answer. Now listen. First, for the props. Let’s mix some mischief... ...Into the flowers Wonderful! And now let’s mix with it A little bit of wine... And the intoxicating feeling this makes for Is what you call love! Let’s mix some mischief... Into the flowers... My mother is calling. Quiet. It’s my mother! Hello! Will you be quiet now? What is it? Hey! What happened!? Anal!? Hey?! Hello? Yes, Auntie...

Come over here! Come! Where can we go? - Digha? Hey one minute! Who all want to go to?Digha, raise your hands... One minute! - What happened? Only couples are allowed! Okay? Because the single ones are damn irritating! Who said I am single? - You are single! I have a partner! - And who is she? My guitar! - Oh yes! No one’s there No one’s there I am all alone No one’s there No one’s there I am all alone Alone... Please, not right now! The rhythms are breaking All times are fusing As we open up everything What shows is the... Skeleton! This city Is clouded by A disease This city Is covered with masks So are the faces here Through intoxicated nights... The whores of the World... Bear children... Who are nothing but maniquin's garbage to the society. That’s enough. It was such a great lunch! Auntie, you’re a very good cook! I can’t cook these dishes. All Porno’s dad likes?is meat. And Porno only likes Chinese food. How can one eat so much of that? That’s the issue. But your banana flowers and the shrimps And the mixed vegetables! Tasted all this after so long! Please give me some fennel seeds... Even our son is like that. There’s nothing that he likes. Orders Pizza often. He can eat that the entire day. You must teach me to cook some of these things. You’re going to be here for some days, right? Though, Krishna-di is a great cook too! We will come over often, okay? - Fine. Please do. I am on a long holiday now. Krishna-di you must get out of it now. It’s been two months. Isn’t it? Let’s do one thing! Both the families, we could all go for a trip. Anal... Will he step out? In the last 2 months all he’s done is gone to school and come back to his room. Doesn’t speak to anyone Where he spends his evenings... he doesn’t say anything. What does he do in his room all the time? Doesn’t even answer my calls. The boy’s hurt. He was very fond of his father. Doesn’t speak much at home too. He is young. And such a shocking incident! Why don’t you find him a counsellor? Why? Has he gone mad?! No... Auntie... counselling doesn’t imply you’ve lost your mind. Lower the volume. Okay. I’ll go and see Anal. Bye, Auntie. Weren’t you suggesting a trip? Do you know of any such place? Not a very popular place... I feel suffocated these days, when I see familiar faces. Where will you go now? Your school isn’t on holiday now. Anal too has school. - Haven’t told you, Maa... I quit the job. What have you done! How will you run the home? The household... Anal's education... You’re well aware, Maa... I am not supposed to be responsiblefor all this. So, I am not. What are you saying!? Want to go for a film? There’s a nice Bengali film running in the theatres. It will lighten your mood. Will you? Yes. - Let me check for the show then! Wait! Just send someone... It’s you... What’s happening downstairs? Picnic? Come in. Speak. You don’t love me anymore? Stop speaking crap. We met after a long time but you didn’t kiss me. You ignored me that day too. I get it now. I don’t like all this. What do you do locked up in? your room all day? I masturbate. You’re insulting me! Do you have anything to tell me, Anal? Are you hiding something? I don’t like seeing you like this. Tell me? Can I tell you something? Promise me, you won’t tell anyone? Promise me. Promise... Krishna-di, the tickets are done. Get dressed, the show’s in an hour. Okay. - Wait, I’ll be back. Let’s ask Anal if he’ll come with us. Then it’s better you people go. I’m sorry, Kaberi... You see, I need my own space. I should be sorry, Didi. I didn’t understand. Go, great dressed now. Okay, I’ll be back. - Okay. Auntie... There’s something I need to ask. After Sudipta-da passed away, mother and son should’ve come closer. Why is it the other way round? Why are you watching all this, Anal! This is sin! Delete this! Shut up! What kind of sin?! - He’s your father! He is not any different, right? Understand this... When we read these porn stories, we watch porn... There are so many relationships? in those things... Father-daughter, Mother-son, brothers-sisters... We forget about all those? relationships... And only concentrate on those? pornographic visuals. The descriptions...the visuals...that’s the real thing. Look at this girl! She isn’t a professional porn girl! This is the only collection I have. My father’s ex girlfriend! Just look at her! Just have a look at the girl! What are you saying, Anal! Who is teaching you all these rubbish. These aren’t your words... This is adult stuff! I am no kid like you, alright? I am an adult now! I am an adult... Adult! You’re smoking? Want some? My dad will throw me out of the house. I hardly managed to get pass marks. Cut it. Tagore never went to school. Tell your dad scoring in exams? isn’t everything. You tell your dad, I’ll tell mine. Do one thing. You tell my dad as well. Bugger! - Pinaki-da... How’s Anal? - No idea. He doesn’t keep in contact. We only talk if he comes to school. Doesn’t take calls too. Since Uncle passed away... - He failed in Math. That score can be settled. Do one thing, bring him to my pad. - He won’t come. That day he said he doesn’t prefer that kind of child play. Said, he found something new, that will take care of his entire life. Don’t act smart. Do as I said. Bring him. Pinaki-da, give us a lift... - Hop on. Hold this. Hello. Hello... Had you fallen asleep? Yes, was about to. What is it so late in the night? Listen... I am sorry for what happened today. It was a mistake. I love you sweetheart! Love you too, Anal! Miss you! Yes, I miss you too!? Listen... I want to see you! Here I am, right in front of you! Oh no! Not like that...

But those are... they’re professionals! I want to... I want to see someone I know! Why don’t you get it? Listen to me! Sorry, Anal. You wouldn’t force me if you loved me. You’re addicted. Sleep. No but I... Just listen to me once! Hello, listen... Rubbish! Anal... Anal! Who are you? Who are you? It’s me! You called me! So I came! Are you real? Are you real! Are you? So if you think.

As if, to rape in my area they seek my permission! I feel like shoving a ruler inside them and empty the shit out of them! Control your language, our daughter’s growing up. Shut up. Don’t talk crap! I can’t say ‘Shit’ now? And your daughter, when she says the same words in English, that’s no issue? That sounds like cake and pastries to you? Okay, calm down. You could’ve come for the film that day. It was a good film. You’re becoming so dry because of the work pressure. Thefts, rapes...that’s all your head is filled with. I can’t stand those stupid films. People who make those films...I should give them all a 3rd degree shelling! All stupid stories! Stop it. You don’t know anything but that.

Your progress report is out. Never told me. I forgot. Forgot or avoided it? I met your school teacher today. I’ve found out what you’ve been up to. Think about it... ...he has more news on me as an outsider but you don’t as a mother. Thank God he is there! - You’re forgetting I am your mother What kind of a son speaks to his mother like this? Let’s not talk about me. You’ve failed your Math paper? Do you have an explanation for this? The Math teacher failed to teach me, Maa! Is that so? How is it that the rest of the students passed then? I know you miss him. I miss him too! I miss him a lot! But that does not mean that... I’ve forgotten about all my responsibilities! I’m doing my job! Then why can’t you do yours? Fine, I’ll make up next time. - How much can you make up? How much? Even if does happen, you’ll lag behind others. You know the kind of man your dad was. What if he was alive today... Would he be very happy? - Look, Maa... Baba is not my idol. Okay? And this life of mine is not meant for pleasing him! And I know what kind of a man he was, so please stop! What the hell are you saying? - Don’t make me spill it out. Stop it. Please stop, okay? Please stop! God knows what I’ll end up saying! Anal! - Shut up! Shut up. Anal... Anal! Anal! Oh, it’s you. Yes, it’s me. You called me. I came. I’m not in the mood today Of course. How can you like me? You’re bored of me now. But why... You loved me so much in the afternoon. Now make my mood! Naughty boy! I know... what you want! Want a striptease? - Yes. Okay! So... how’s your revolution going? What revolution? I heard... ...that you’ve requested the headmaster... ...for extra classes for the correct sex education? Yes, I did. But he said... no one wants to teach. Particularly not the female teachers. Do one thing. Open up your own private classes. Classes from VATSYAYANA! For both the genders. ‘Theoretical?and practical classes of sex education!’ It’ll be a hit! This attitude of yours is the problem. Sorry, Sir, I was just kidding. That’s all. By the way, did you hear? The Supreme Court has banned the porn websites. Where did porn come in here? Completely different things. No, it’s the same! - Morning. Have you ever heard a proper dump without a pee? Those are interdependent, like parasites. My God! Seems it’s impossible to talk to you people regarding this! True. Unlike you we’re not really... ...post-modern, right? Post-modern? Correct. Have you ever been to the student’s toilets? Seen the things they scribble and draw on the walls? You will be sorry to hear, They’ve drawn a cartoon of you. Tagged as ‘Three Times prolong!’ You’re the math teacher, you see... Your phone number’s there too. What! Ignore it. You’ll do better. Don’t go looking for a reason or solution. Whoever did this, we need to find him... ...and give him a nice shelling! Like finding a needle in the hay! And by the way, that student from your class... ...Anal Chakrabarty you know about his mental status? He who got caught with porn. Very mischievous lad. I told his mother... He’s failed this time. Wait a minute. You think he did this? No I am trying to say for him, or pupils like him for all of them really. losing the father, adolescence, educational pressure, you see, it is all interconnected. So you mean he is... ...the tragedy and shock is driving him mad? Please, Sir! This is the nature of his age. And that’s the scariest bit. At this age, developing unnatural sexual disorders and the like... are common due to lack of proper guidance. Later, in their professional life social and family life this comes out in the form of rape, domestic violence... And various such sadisms and sexually oppressive behaviour! Sorry, Sir. Never looked at it that way. We could speak to the Headmaster on your behalf. Yes. Right. Exactly. Thank you. By the way, I have prawn today Want some? Is that so? Sure... You’re really something!

Aren’t you ashamed? Why did you become a mother? You never care for me! - Why, who cares for you then? What the hell have you done for me? You don’t deserve to be a mother! Did you ever ask why I come home drunk every day since father passed away? Ever hugged me close? Did you ever try to talk to me? Ever sat beside me once? Ever wondered what I am going through? You’ve been insulting me, avoiding me! But I tried to do everything I could! Or else I’d never stay here after he left! Exactly! You got pregnant having fun! You’re not supposed to be responsible!

Everything will fall apart! Everything! Maa... What truth? I... I’m not your mother. Only your father’s friend. Your mother, I and your Dad We went to the same college. They used to love each other. And... Mine was one-sided love for your father. Then they got married. You were born. Your mother died of Septicaemia. From that day I stood beside your father. I became your mother. Took up your responsibility for life. I never conceived. Just like your Dad wanted. I served the two of you for all these years... Because I love you... Not because I was having fun.
