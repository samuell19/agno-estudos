I THOUGHT WE'D TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW AND THE NEW RECORD, AND THEN OPEN IT OUT INTO A WIDER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BAND. YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S FINE. - SO THIS IS YOUR FIRST SOLO TOUR, RIGHT? - -THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. HOW DOES IT FEEL NOT HAVING THE REST OF THE BAND WITH YOU? IT'S STRANGE. I MEAN IT FEELS, IT FEELS FUCKING EXPOSING, BASICALLY. IT FEELS, UM... YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY, WHEN I WAS WITH THE BAND I COULD HIDE, BEING PART OF THE GROUP... DEELEY, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AROUND FOR A WHILE. HOW HAVE... WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? UH, UH, RIGHT HERE, WORKING AWAY. I HEAR YOU'RE BACK IN THE STUDIO. YEAH, WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE SOMETHING OUT NEXT YEAR. - HOW'S IT GOING? - IT'S HARD. IT'S FUCKING HARD, BUT YOU KNOW, CAN'T COMPLAIN. IT FEELS LIKE YOU'VE CARVED OUT A NEW SPACE FOR YOURSELF, IN TERMS OF THE SONIC LANDSCAPE YOU'VE MANAGED TO CREATE. HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT DEFINING THAT DYNAMIC? BEING SO FAR AWAY FROM WHAT FELT NORMAL WAS KIND OF A TRIP. I THINK IT... YOU KNOW, IT REALLY HELPS US TO GRAB SOMETHING THAT FELT, YOU KNOW... LOSE YOURSELF IN. I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE 12 SEPARATE IDEAS GLUED TOGETHER WITH SOME FLASH PRODUCTION. I WANTED IT TO FEEL LIKE A COMPLETE JOURNEY. I HEARD YOU HAD SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH YOUR LABEL WHILE YOU WERE IN THE STUDIO. OH, REALLY? WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT? I'M A JOURNALIST. I TALK TO PEOPLE. IT ISN'T ABOUT THAT! IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO SAID WHAT TO WHO OR WHAT YOU HEARD FROM WHOMEVER. PEOPLE CAN CHAT IF THEY WANNA CHAT. FOR ME, IT'S ABOUT THE MUSIC AND... LISTENING TO THE NEW ALBUM I WAS STRUCK BY HOW MUCH OF A DEPARTURE IT WAS FROM YOUR LAST COUPLE OF RECORDS. THERE'S DEFINITELY A MORE AGGRESSIVELY POLITICAL ANGLE TO THE CONTENT. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TRIGGERED THAT CHANGE IN DIRECTION? EVERY RECORD IS POLITICAL. FOR US, THE POLITICS CAME OUT OF, WELL, AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE, INTERNAL CONFLICT. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAD TO SIT DOWN, GENERALLY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO KEEP GOING OR END IT. IT GOT THAT SERIOUS? YEAH, AFTER 15 YEARS THERE WAS A LOT THAT NEEDED TO BE RESOLVED. MAINLY, WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITHOUT IT KICKING OFF AND WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD STILL INSPIRE EACH OTHER. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU DECIDED THAT YOU COULD. WELL, WE DECIDED WE WANTED TO GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY, AND IF WE WERE GONNA GO THROUGH, WE WERE GONNA BE BOLD AND KICK AWAY FROM WHAT FELT FAMILIAR. WE WANTED TO REINVENT OURSELVES. WE WANTED TO FEEL RELEVANT AGAIN. AND YOU BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE? YEAH, YEAH, I DO. THAT WAS GREAT. THANKS FOR TALKING TO THE MAGAZINE. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? YEAH, FINE. - YOU KNOW. - NO, I DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN TALK TO ME. - WE CAN STILL... - CAN WE? YOU KNOW YOU CAN. OR YOU COULD, IF YOU TRIED. DEELEY... I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU. HELLO? ARE YOU THERE? THIS IS A PRETTY SERIOUS COLLECTION. YEAH, IT'S AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD. MUSIC JOURNALIST, RIGHT? RIGHT. I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD OF ANY OF THESE BANDS. OH, DON'T FEEL TOO BAD, NEITHER HAS 99% OF THE RECORD BUYING PUBLIC, SO... SINCE WHEN ARE THE PUBLIC STILL BUYING RECORDS? SO, IDEALIST, OR JUST STUBBORN? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK WE ALL WANT TO OWN SOMETHING, PUT TOGETHER WITH SOME CARE AND A BIT OF ARTISTRY. I THINK WE NEED IT, DON'T WE? IDEALIST IT IS. PUT SOMETHING ON. - YEAH? - YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU INTO? ANYTHING. I WISH I'D LEARNED TO PLAY GUITAR. YEAH, SO DO I EVERY TIME I PICK THAT FUCKING THING UP. I LIKE IT. SO HOW DOES THIS... ARE THERE ANY RULES? - UH-UH. - WHAT? UH, I'M... - I'M SORRY. - IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY. THAT WAS FUN. YEAH. IT WAS... OH, YOU HAVE JACEK RUDZKI. YEAH, IT'S JOHN CAGE, I THINK. NO, THE DESIGNER. YOU KNOW HIM? NO, WE, UM, SHOWED SOME OF HIS STUFF. WE? I WORK IN A GALLERY. OH, WHICH ONE? IT'S ALL RIGHT. SEEN ANYTHING GOOD? OH, NO, NO, NO, NOT... NOT REALLY - WELL. - SO DO YOU... HAVE YOU DONE THIS... DONE THIS BEFORE? YEAH. A COUPLE OF TIMES. WHY? I COULD ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. - YOU COULD. - YEAH, BUT I WON'T BECAUSE... - JESUS! - WHAT? - LOOK, I... - WHAT? WHAT IS IT? - I... - MICHELLE, WHAT IS IT? I THINK I... I THINK I JUST... I DON'T KNOW, I THINK... - WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BE... - I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A FIGHT. - A FIGHT? - YEAH. IT WAS OVER IN A SECOND, BUT... WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU SEE? A GIRL STRUGGLING WITH THIS GUY. WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE? - I DON'T KNOW. ASIAN. - ASIAN? CHINESE, ORIENTAL, I DON'T KNOW. THEN WHAT DID YOU SEE? NOTHING. HE GRABBED HER, THEY FOUGHT, AND THEN THEY... - AND THEN THEY? - THEY... THEY DISAPPEARED. - DISAPPEARED? - OUT OF SIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? CALLING THE POLICE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M LEAVING. WHY? I'M NOT TALKING TO THE POLICE. WELL, WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. NOT MY PROBLEM. WAIT. LOOK... GET OUT OF MY WAY. - MICHELLE. - GET OUT OF MY WAY. METROPOLITAN POLICE, HOW CAN I HELP? HI. I, UH, I THINK... CALLER? THERE'S A WOMAN ACROSS FROM WHERE I LIVE. I THINK SHE MIGHT NEED YOUR HELP. OKAY. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED? I THINK... SHE MIGHT... BE HURT. YOU THINK SHE MIGHT BE HURT? CAN YOU GIVE ME HER NAME? NO, I... I... I DON'T KNOW HER NAME, SORRY. THAT'S OKAY. CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW? CALLER? CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW? CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR NAME? CALLER? ARE YOU STILL THERE? CALLER, CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR NAME? I'M GOING TO NEED A LOCATION. CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR... SO, WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU SEE? A FIGHT, MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW, A SCUFFLE. A FIGHT, MAYBE A SCUFFLE. - AND YOU'RE SURE SHE WASN'T INTO IT? - -WHAT? YOU KNOW, HOLD ME DOWN, TIE ME UP, SLAP ME ABOUT. SOME GIRLS LOVE THAT SHIT. YEAH, WELL, NOT THIS GIRL. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I JUST KNOW. YOU JUST KNOW. BUT I WOULD KNOW. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? - I SEE HER EVERY NIGHT, PETE. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SEE HER EVERY NIGHT? I CAN SEE HER FLAT FROM MY WINDOW, SO I... I WOULD KNOW IF SHE WAS INTO ANYTHING WEIRD. RIGHT, UM, HAVE YOU CALLED THE POLICE? YEAH. NO. WELL, WHICH IS IT? - DEELEY? - NOT YET. OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE. DEELEY, JUST TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAW, LET THEM DEAL WITH IT. - MATE, HOW'VE YOU BEEN? - FINE. I'VE BEEN... AM FINE. COME INTO THE OFFICE. - WHY? - WHY NOT? I'VE GOT... I'VE GOT TOO MUCH ON. YOU, UH, READY TO START COVERING GIGS AGAIN? I NEED YOU OUT THERE, MAN, FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS. EIGHT MONTHS, MAN. I KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN. LOOK, A FUCKED UP THING HAPPENED TO YOU, NOBODY DOUBTS IT, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET BACK OUT INTO THE WORLD. JUST GET ME THOSE REVIEWS BY THE END OF THE DAY. SURE. OKAY. OH, I LIKE THE ELECTRONS PIECE, BY THE WAY. THANKS. THE BUSINESS JUST SORT OF SUCKED THE LIFE OUT OF ME. I FELT I... I WAS BECOMING THIS REALLY JADED PERSON. WHAT WOULD SAY BROUGHT YOU THROUGH THAT MOMENT OF... DARKNESS? IS THAT THE RIGHT WORD, IS IT? - DARKNESS? - YEAH. DARKNESS SOUNDS FAIRLY ACCURATE. I THINK LETTING CERTAIN THINGS GO WAS WHAT DID IT. NOT WORRYING ABOUT THE STATE OF MY CAREER OR THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY. A MILLION OTHER THINGS THAT FUCK WITH YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU GET SOME SUCCESS. JUST CONCENTRATING ON THE MUSIC WAS INCREDIBLY LIBERATING, AND I THINK IT GAVE SOMETHING TO MY SOUND, A SENSE OF FREEDOM... HELLO? ARE YOU STILL THERE? YEAH, SORRY. UH, SO... SO THE ALBUM... WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE THE ALBUM FEEL ORGANIC AND CONNECTED. I WANTED THE PRODUCTION TO HAVE A SIMPLICITY THAT ALLOWED YOU TO READ THE SENTENCES OUT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE SINGLE IS COMING. EVERYONE IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DO MORE WITH LESS. STRIP IT BACK TO THE CORE ESSENTIALS THERE'S A REAL CHARM TO THOSE KINDS OF RECORDS. AND I NOTICED THAT THEY REALLY MOVE YOU. AND IF I'M TRYING TO DO ANYTHING, IT'S JUST THAT, I SUPPOSE. MOVE YOU. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? GREAT. WELL, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO END IT. - YOU GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED? - -I THINK SO. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. JESUS, DEELEY, I'M PRETTY SURE ONE OF THE REASONS WE PAY TAXES HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. HER PLACE WAS A MESS. WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE DIDN'T GO THERE VOLUNTARILY. THEN CALL THE FUCKING POLICE. THEY'D TAKE A VERY DIM VIEW OF BREAKING AND ENTERING, PETE. - LOOK, IF THIS BIRD... - KEM. WHAT? HER NAME'S KEM. I THINK SHE'S CHINESE. OKAY, FINE, IF THIS KEM REALLY IS IN TROUBLE, I THINK THEY'LL FORGIVE A BIT OF OVERZEALOUS DETECTIVE WORK ON YOUR PART. ARE YOU LISTENING? - DEELEY? - YEAH, YEAH. JESUS CHRIST, FOR THE SECOND TIME I'M ASKING REVIEWS. THIS AFTERNOON, PLEASE. HELLO? HELLO? YOU'RE KIDDING ME HERE, MAN, WHAT IS GOING ON? YEAH, YEAH, THIS AFTERNOON. HEY, UM, I'M LOOKING FOR... I THINK HER NAME'S KEM, DO YOU KNOW THAT NAME? PLEASE. PLEASE. I REALLY NEED TO FIND HER. I THINK SHE MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE. - ANDREW DEELEY. - MMM? WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU BLEEDING ON MY FLOOR? HOW DID YOU GET HERE? LONDON'S A BIG PLACE, BROTHER, AND I DON'T ADVERTISE. NOW, HOW THE FUCK DID YOU GET HERE? I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND... A FRIEND. HER? SHE'S YOUR FRIEND? I OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE HER. HOW DO YOU KNOW HER? HMM? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU... GET THE FUCK OFF ME! GET THE... GET OFF ME! NO, GET THE... GET THE FUCK OFF ME! GET OFF! GET... ALL RIGHT, OKAY! SHE... SHE LIVES NEAR ME AND WE'RE NEIGHBORS AND... - NEIGHBORS? - YEAH. I'D SEE HER. YOU SEE HER? SOMETIMES... FROM MY WINDOW. YOU SEE HER FROM YOUR WINDOW? LOOK, SOMETHING HAPPENED. SOMEONE TOOK HER. WHO? KIDNAPPED. SHE... SHE GOT KIDNAPPED TWO DAYS AGO. I SAW THE CAR, THE... THE PORSCHE, I SAW HER OUTSIDE THE FLAT LAST NIGHT AND I... I... YOU THOUGHT WHAT? HMM? I DON'T KNOW... I DON'T KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT. LOOK, I BROKE INTO HER FLAT, FOUND AN ADDRESS. I... I FOLLOWED SOMEONE FROM THERE HERE... - WHO? - A GIRL. I DON'T KNOW HER NAME. I DON'T. PLEASE! I DON'T KNOW HER NAME. YOU WANT A LIFT HOME? RELAX. WE ALREADY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. HI, YOU'VE REACHED MICHELLE, LEAVE ME A MESSAGE. HEY, MICHELLE, IT'S DEELEY AGAIN. LOOK, I REALLY NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU, OKAY? SO, GIVE ME A CALL, PLEASE. ANYTIME. IT'S IMPORTANT. HOW THE FUCK DID YOU FIND ME? I'M A JOURNALIST, REMEMBER? YOU SAID YOU WORKED IN A GALLERY. YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU OWNED IT. I DIDN'T SAY A LOT OF THINGS. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE HAVE TO GO TO THE POLICE. - WE? - YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAW. NO. THIS IS MY LIFE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? I'VE GOT A LOT TO LOSE. SO DOES KEM. KEM? THE GIRL YOU SAW. DON'T COME BACK HERE. I COULD MAKE THINGS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR YOU, AMY. THAT'S YOUR REAL NAME, ISN'T IT? IT IS. AND YOU COULD. BUT YOU WON'T. WHY'S THAT? BECAUSE EVIDENTLY, YOU'RE A NICE GUY. GO HOME AND FORGET ABOUT HER. FORGET ABOUT THAT NIGHT. FORGET ABOUT ME. AND WHAT IF I CAN'T? TRY HARDER. SHE'S GONE. THE PLACE WAS TRASHED AND THERE WAS BLOOD. TRY FORGETTING THAT. I GIVE TO HER MY HOURS NEXT WEEK. KEM COMES WHEN I WORK. I GIVE HER FOOD. HOW DO YOU KNOW HER? WE LIVED TOGETHER BEFORE. THE PLACE IN TOTTENHAM? FOREST GATE. THE LANDLORD HE... WHAT? THE LANDLORD WHAT? HE TOOK OUR MONEY, THEN HE CALLED POLICE. YOU'RE ILLEGAL, YOU AND KEM. I NEED THIS JOB. TAKE THIS, IT'S OKAY. WHAT DOES IT SAY? IT'S FROM HER PARENTS. THEY SAY THEY MISS HER. THEY HEARD SHE IS OKAY. THEY WAIT FOR HER RETURN. PLEASE HELP HER. - PETE. - CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE FIRED. - AGAIN? - -WHERE IS THE FUCKING COPY? I HAD TO DO SOMETHING. YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING. DO YOU NOT THINK THIS IS GETTING A BIT OUT OF HAND, MATE? - THIS? - -CHASING SOME GIRL HALF WAY ACROSS LONDON. I MEAN, I'M ASSUMING THIS IS THE THING YOU HAD TO DO. - IT IS. - WHY? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? HEY, I, UM, I'M JUST, UH... WHERE'S... WHERE'S KEM? - GET OUT! - LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO CAUSE YOU ANY TROUBLE, OKAY? I JUST NEED TO... GET THE FUCK OUT! WHAT THE FUCK. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? THEY WORK. THEY'RE LEGAL. I'M JUST LOOKING FOR KEM. - I DON'T KNOW KEM. - YOU DO KNOW KEM. I DON'T KNOW KEM! YOU TELL ME. YOU TELL THE POLICE. YOU CAN RUN. THEY CAN RUN, AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT SOMEWHERE TO GO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE KEM IS. I LAST SAW HER A FEW MONTHS AGO. WHERE? WHERE? SHE USED TO HAVE BOYFRIEND. HERE? IN LONDON? TAKE ME THERE. NO, I CANNOT. WE TRAVEL A LONG TIME TO GET HERE. ONLY CERTAIN ROUTE AVAILABLE WHERE SHE TOU HAVE CONNECTIONS. - SAY... - SHE TOU, SNAKEHEAD. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CALLED. WE GO THROUGH RUSSIA, SPAIN, FRANCE, MANY COUNTRIES. WHAT HAPPENED TO KEM? JOURNEY EXPENSIVE. WE GET HERE WE HAVE TO BORROW FROM LOAN SHARK FOR BALANCE OF PAYMENT. - DANGEROUS PEOPLE! - WHAT HAPPENED TO KEM? ALL I KNOW, KEM ARRIVED IN MANCHESTER. - WHAT HAPPENED THERE? - I DON'T KNOW. - DON'T FUCKING LIE TO ME. - I'M NOT. KEM IS MY FRIEND. THEN HELP HER. HAN. HELLO. WHAT'S HE SAYING? HE SAID HE DON'T KNOW WHERE KEM IS. WELL, ASK HIM ABOUT MANCHESTER. SHE WAS REPAYING HER DEBT. THE GANG PUT HER IN THE GHOST APARTMENT. GHOST APARTMENT? WHAT'S A GHOST APARTMENT? THEY MAKE HER PRETEND TO BE RICH STUDENT. ADVERTISE FOR OTHER RICH CHINESE STUDENT TO SHARE WITH HER, AND THEY BEAT HER. TORTURED FOR MONEY. THEIR PARENTS BLACKMAILED. KEM RAN FROM THEM. SHE CAME HERE WITH DEBTS STILL OWING. WHO TOLD THEM WHERE... WAIT, YOU TOLD THEM WHERE SHE... WAIT! DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME. ALL RIGHT. - HELLO? - GUESS WHO? SO YOU WENT TO SEE HAN. HE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE STAYING ON YOUR FEET AROUND MY PEOPLE. - YOUR PEOPLE? - YEAH. HE WORKS FOR ME FROM TIME TO TIME. THAT'S HOW YOU MET KEM? CORRECT. AND THAT'S YOUR PLACE, RIGHT? IT'S A DROPBOX. SHE WAS CARETAKING. KEM OWES A SNAKEHEAD, CALLED MAMA LAU 12 GRAND. THAT'S WHO SHE WAS WORKING FOR IN MANCHESTER. THIS IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND THE GUY WHO TOOK HER. ZHANG, ONE OF MAMA LAU'S CREW. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? CAUTION. AT LAST. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW SHE GOT HERE? DESPERATION IS A POWERFUL THING. IT MAKES PEOPLE DO SOME RECKLESS SHIT. THAT'S WHY WE FIND DEAD BODIES IN THE BACK OF LORRIES, CARGO SHIPS, FISHING BOATS. DESPERATION MAKES THE WRONG PEOPLE START ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY MY NORTHERN COMPETITORS DISAGREE WITH MY TAKE ON THE SITUATION, THEY'RE STILL RUNNING AROUND LIKE IT'S THE 80'S. ALL THAT OLD SCHOOL SHIT. FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT MAKING A POINT. IT'S A QUESTION OF MANPOWER. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR A WAR. NOT YET. I LIKE KEM. BUT I CAN'T BE SEEN MAKING MOVES AGAINST THEM. WHAT, AND I CAN? YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO HELP HER. NOW YOU KNOW HOW. THAT'S HIM. THAT'S THE GUY. YOU SURE? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I GOT HIM. ARE YOU STILL THERE? WHAT WAS I DOING? OH, YEAH. EXCUSE ME. WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE? I FOUND OUT WHERE SHE IS. YOU'RE MARRIED. - DOES IT MATTER? - A BIT. DOES HE KNOW? WHAT DO YOU THINK? SO, WHAT, YOU JUST HOOK UP WITH GUYS ON THE INTERNET FOR FUN? TO PASS THE TIME? WE BOTH HAVE OUR REASONS FOR LIVING THE WAY THAT WE DO. LIVING THE WAY THAT WE DO. WHY DON'T WE JUST LET IT BE WHAT IT WAS. AND WHAT WAS THAT EXACTLY? PLEASURE. NO QUESTIONS, NO BULLSHIT. JUST A FEW MOMENTS OF PURE UNCOMPLICATED PLEASURE. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. NOW WHY DON'T YOU START GIVING ME SOME ANSWERS, 'CAUSE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE HERE WITH A FEW SECRETS. THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS? THE FACT THAT YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT COMFORTABLE IN YOUR OWN SKIN, AND OBVIOUSLY INVOLVED IN SOMETHING PRETTY FUCKING SCARY. A WHILE BACK I WAS REVIEWING A GIG, A GIRL WAS GETTING SOME HASSLE OFF A FEW GUYS AND I STEPPED IN. THINGS GOT HEATED. HEATED? A BROKEN BOTTLE, FOUR CRACKED RIBS, 22 STITCHES, AND A PUNCTURED LUNG. HEATED. SO HOW DOES KEM FIT INTO THIS? I'VE BEEN WATCHING HER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WATCHING HER? FROM MY FRONT ROOM. THE BINOCULARS? HOW LONG? A WHILE. - A WHILE? - A FEW MONTHS. THAT'S AWFUL. WHAT, YOU'VE BEEN SPYING ON THIS GIRL, NOW YOU WANT TO SAVE HER? I FOUND A STACK OF THESE IN HIS CAR. I THINK THAT'S WHERE SHE IS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SAVING HER, BUT I KNOW SHE NEEDS SOMEONE TO FIND HER. IT'S 60 POUNDS FOR HALF AN HOUR. 90 POUNDS FOR ONE HOUR. YOU ARRANGE WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THE GIRL. IS THIS EVERYONE? THESE ARE ALL THE GIRLS YOU HAVE? THE OTHER GIRLS ARE WORKING. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ANYTHING PARTICULAR, DARLING? YOU HELP ME. HELP YOU? I'M TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE. WHO YOU LOOK FOR? KEM.

NO, PLEASE. PLEASE. SORRY. WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M NEARLY FINISHED, MATE. JUST GIVE ME A SECOND. - GET OUT. - -I SAID I'M NEARLY FINISHED. GET THE FUCK OUT! GET OUT! IT'S OKAY. OH, NO. NO, NO. IT'S OKAY. IT'S... IT'S OKAY. KEM, RIGHT? WHO ARE YOU? A FRIEND. MOVE. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? ARE YOU HERE FOR BUSINESS? - ARE YOU HERE FOR BUSINESS? - I'M HERE FOR HER. WELL, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO DOWNSTAIRS INSTEAD OF CAUSING ALL THIS FUCKING COMMOTION? WE'RE LEAVING. EXCUSE ME? I SAID WE'RE LEAVING. EASY, BOSS, WHAT ANYBODY WANTS IS A GOOD TIME HERE. GIVE ME THE FUCKING GUN! KEM? WAIT! PUT IT DOWN. PUT IT DOWN. DEELEY? DEELEY? GET UP. DEELEY. DEELEY. KEM. THEY'RE GETTING AWAY! REM! REM! DEELEY! REM! DEELEY! DEELEY! DEELEY! SHE'S GONE. SHE'S GONE.
