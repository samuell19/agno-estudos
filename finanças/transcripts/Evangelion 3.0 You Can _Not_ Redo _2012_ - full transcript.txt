Contact with target in 80. Target verified. No change in interception coordinates. Maintaining Shift M. Everything is go. Two Dash, prepare for rendezvous. Eight's low altitude limits it to 96 seconds of fire support before re-entry. Get this wrapped up before then. Reflected waves in target area. Hostiles incoming. That's the automatic defence system. Not a problem. Multiple explosive blasts! Blast front in three, two, one... Second wave incoming. Pattern Blue. Expect a rough ride. Incoming target classified as a Code 4A object. This thing's projecting an anti-AT Field! What a prick! Screw this helmet! Quit singing, Four-Eyed Crony! You're pissing me off! Your cover fire is two seconds late! Actually, you're three seconds early! Then improvise, damn it! Your wish is my command, Your Highness! Fullerene shift cleared! Area 89, final defence line, breached! Wait, the target is now moving! Orbital correction can't keep up! It'll be close, but I'm going in! Starting deceleration! Eight, seven, six, five... Four, three, two, one... Burn complete! Two Dash has jettisoned its final stage boosters. Minimum safe distance for re-entry achieved. Target secured. Returning to base. Roger. We'll be waiting at the collection point. - Rendezvous code is Saturn V. - Roger. Pattern Blue?! Where?! Hostile classified Code 4B. Deploying field reflection surface. Oh, give me a break. We're just about to go into re-entry! Four-Eyed Crony, backup! Sorry! I didn't gain enough altitude, so I'm out of here. This one's gotta be self-service! Buh-bye! Useless! Damn persistent jerk! This wasn't part of the mission briefing! Ouch! What's the deal with this light?! My AT Field isn't neutralizing it! Gotta kill that core block! Come back here, you little prick! Crap, I can't maintain my re-entry angle! I might break up! Two Dash, keep your mission the top priority. Don't let go of your target even if you lose everything else. You don't have to tell me that! Damn it, do something, Shinji, you idiot! Welcome back, Shinji Ikari. I've been waiting for you. Cardiovascular function is normal. No paralysis in his limbs. Yes, ma'am, his eyes are open. Do you understand what I am saying to you? Uh, where am I? He's responsive. He seems to be completely conscious. The last thing I remember is saving Ayanami... Yes, ma'am, he seems to exhibit continuity in his memory recall. Um, where's Ayanami? Do you know who this is? Er... That's me. He has self-awareness, as well. He seems to be fine. What is this? Cargo loading 86% complete. Maintain N2 reactor output at 90%. No ships detected out to 1200. No unidentified aircraft, either. - Priority One on D Block crew boarding. - Send more people to load provisions! Check No. 3 and No. 5 gyroscopes. I'm detecting misalignments. Updating outfitting roadmap. Armaments behind by 3%. Subject BM-03 has been placed in custody. Understood. Remove the restraints. You can go. Reverifying standard helm control. All systems green. Ms. Misato Katsuragi...? He is Shinji Ikari, isn't he? He seems to be. Physiologically, he is a perfect match to the Third Boy. His body tissue and signs of dental work are exact duplicates of his medical records at the time of the N3I. We are currently analysing the results of his deep synchronization test. Has the DSS choker been attached to his neck? Already done, Captain Katsuragi. Captain Katsuragi? So it is you, Misato. Huh? The DSS is operating just fine. It's set to your personal password. Understood. What is this thing? Come on, take it off! That thing is never coming off... This interview is over. Take him to quarantine. We've lost Decoys 01 and 05. Detecting wavelengths. What is this? It's Pattern Blue! Target classified as a Code 4C, Nemesis Series Entity. They don't give up. They're in a vertical formation. They want to pen us in. We're not ready to move yet. Halt all operations except main engine fitting. All hands, battle stations condition 2! Target, the entire Nemesis Series. Roger, all hands assume battle stations condition 2. Ready anti-air, anti-surface and anti-underwater ordnance! Abort all loading and fuelling ops. Crew are to board immediately. All stations, discontinue loading. Priority One for boarding crew members. Continue fitting of the main engine. Verify all gates of the power flow. All aircraft are to evacuate from this area immediately. Proceed to Assembly Point No. 2. Ditch any supplies not yet loaded. Crew boarding has highest priority. Continue with the outfitting right up until enemy contact. Anyone who can help with the power supply lines, assemble at the runabout. Ready all turrets for engagement. Activate remote control and integrated FCS. Be prepared for sudden engagements. Continue supplying power to the main engine conductors! Hurry it up! N2 reactor output holding steady at 99%. Continue working on the power supply. Open all valves through No. 90. Power supply pipes connection complete. No. 3 and No. 4 port side hub stations are nominal. Roger, opening all valves through No. 90. Beginning power supply flow. Power supply to the N2 reactor is holding steady. Checking LCL circulation pump. Verifying filtration system. It's battle stations, people! Get to your posts! You there! Get the lead out! You're asking the impossible, Chief! This is a ragtag crew, both military and civilian. Spare me the excuses! Get to work! This is why I hate young men... Let's see... We'll stop the fitting at this stage... Closing and securing bulkheads... Is this it? Gotta be vigilant about aerial attacks. Anything on sonar shows up here. Kitakami, deck plating status? Wait, am I in charge of that? That's one of your jobs! Of course you are! For real?! Right, then... Moving now would be dangerous. We'll stay here. Still, it sure is exciting to be on the bridge during a battle alert! Roger, integrate the anti-air weapons systems. Priority One on guarding Unit 01! Unit 01? Incoming target! Pillars of Light confirmed! Um, their numbers are increasing! Unable to detect enemy's core block. It's most likely hiding inside its camouflage cocoon. This is bad. We'll come under saturation attack at this rate. Contact in 600 seconds! Captain Katsuragi, I recommend that we scatter the fleet immediately. We're undermanned and under trained. And the ship isn't even fully outfitted. And to top it all off, we have no fix on their core block. In short, our chances of defeating them are nil. We should retreat like we always do. We have no other choice, Captain! All the more reason to shake things up and make a break from the past. XO, take us up. Go up? Wait, you want to activate the main engine?! All hands, prepare for launch! Prepare to power up the main engine! Captain Katsuragi, this ship isn't ready for a trial under fire! I agree! It's too dangerous without a test run! I've never used gravity control. I can't be sure I can do it. I'll pass on an unwinnable battle. I don't want to die just yet. When you die, you die. You youngsters shouldn't be so picky. I thought old geezers like you were supposed to be cautious! I'm aware of the risks. We will draw our target into the open with this ship. It's time we found out if this ship is capable of deicide. But an ignition system hasn't been installed yet. Hold on, are you thinking of using an Eva?! - Mari? - Unit 08's still a no-go. - Asuka? - Asuka? Already on it! You just need me to jam in the igniter, right? I'm counting on you. But the containment field is dangerously strong near the engine. Besides, your Eva is still undergoing a refit. Well, the Colonel's motto is "Mission first, safety last." No time to worry about it! Eva Unit 02 Improved, activate! Deploying Unit 02 Improved. Roger, Unit 02 Improved launching. Drop underwater motor and No. 1 deployable container. And here I just got Unit 02 Improved looking all new and spiffy. Talk about a mundane debut. It really is Eva Unit 02! What a relief... Asuka's okay... Misato, what about me? All hands, assume battle stations! All personnel, man your battle stations. I repeat, man your battle stations. Change command control to combat mode. Primary crew to the battle bridge. Ready gravity ballast systems. Roger. Checking all vent systems. Focus the ship's control systems to the anchoring plug. Roger. Readying descent. Checking injectors. Starting countdown. Misato! Unit 01 is here, right? I'll pilot it. I'll help Asuka! Shouldn't I be piloting Unit 01?! Misato! Ready plug interior for entry sequence. No, you shouldn't. There's no need for you to pilot it. Initiating Hirnstamm Tower separation and movement. Currently transferring command control to the battle bridge. There's no need? Um... Then... What am I supposed to do? Misato! Shinji Ikari. Don't do anything. Filling interior with LCL gas. Minimum ionization density reached. Start entry sequence. LCL ionization is nominal. Initiating all computational integration systems. Sit-rep? All crew accounted for. Transfer confirmed. Primary launch checklist completed. Bulkhead lock down confirmed. Pressure check complete. APU power output increasing. Power feed to main engine for ignition in progress. 5% to critical threshold. Initializing gyrocompass. Stabilizers show green. Starting data processing visualization. Activating main monitor. Target still inbound. They're taking up an encircling formation. Unit 02 Improved has discarded thruster and is swapping out its left arm. Easy does it... All right, then. Let's do this! Deploy AT Field. - Change detected in Pillars of Light! - Energy levels increasing! The entire formation is moving! A cruiser has been vaporized! It's a saturation attack. If they reach us, we're done for. Contact in 360 seconds. Here we go! - Unit 02 has begun ignition prep! - Flow pressure rate at 300%! Ignore it! Direct all energy to the flywheel! Priority One! No. 7 converter array has exploded! Forget the lines that have gone down! Continue forced power infusion! Ignore all the pressure gauges! Flywheel pressure plate lock disabled! Initiating rotation! Main engine energy pump enabled! Adjusting APU rotation power to 80%! Force-inject catalyst! And next up is... Contact in 35 seconds! - RPMs increasing! 10,000! 12,000! - Unit 02 Improved in ignition position! That's it! Flywheel powered at 102%! Threshold has been achieved! Main engine activation now at final stage. Roger, change helm systems. Roger, enabling space-time control. Switching over to tri-axial helm systems. Deploy AT Field concurrently with ignition. RPM at 36,000! All systems green! We are go for contact! Skip countdown! Initiate primary contact! Contact! Ignition! Course is clear! Check the ship's systems! Order all friendly ships to evacuate! Here we go... Wunder, launch! Main wings pierced! Damage unknown! Ignore it! Ready enemy annihilation! Pitch 90 degrees down. Go astern! Go astern, aye! Drag the core block out of its camouflage cocoon! Fractures forming in main wing structural beams! Hold your course! Give me full engine power! All back full! Maximum combat speed! We've dragged out the core blocks!! Now! Hard to port! Swing them around! Aye aye! Full thrusters! Emergency stop! Targets have gone silent! Main guns, ready fire! Load energy AP rounds! All turrets, enable direct feed from main engine! Engage reload circuits! Aye aye, circuits engaged! Range correction still underway! Range keeper has not engaged! All turrets still have direct visual targeting and manual tracking! That's good enough! Fire! Target has been destroyed! All stations, stand down to alert condition 2. Prepare for retrieval of Unit 02 Improved. Expedite damage control on the main wings. Oh, wow... We actually won. Man, that was pushing it... This Captain's even more interesting than Kaji let on. So this is the power to slay gods... Wunder is a fitting name for a ship that embodies hope. Subject BM-03, provisionally Mr. Shinji Ikari? The XO would like to fill you in. This is Unit 01? Yes, Unit 01 is currently being employed as this ship's main engine power core. Hence, no pilot is needed. I guess I'm really not needed... Also, the results of your deep synchronization tests have come in. Your synchronization rate was 0.00%. Even if you boarded an Eva, it wouldn't activate. Wow. Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Ikari? That said, we cannot ignore that you recently had Unit 01 awakened for 12 seconds. For this reason, you have been fitted with a DSS choker. What is it? Our insurance policy. A physical fail-safe device meant to prevent any further awakenings. It symbolizes our distrust of you, as well as your punishment. What are you talking about? If you allow your emotions to overwhelm you while piloting an Eva and the risk of another awakening becomes real, we will shut it down through the loss of your life. Does that mean... I die? I won't deny it. You must be kidding... Misato? What's going on here? Why am I going to be killed? This is crazy, Misato! How am I supposed to take this in all of a sudden? Your confusion is only natural. Lieutenant! - Yes, ma'am! - Tell him your name and rank. Yes, ma'am! Uh, I realize it's a little late, but I'm your supervising medical officer, Lieutenant Sakura Suzuhara. - It's nice to meet you. - You, too. Wait, Suzuhara? Are you related to Tohji? That's right. Thank you for looking out for my big brother. I'm his little sister, Sakura. Little sister? Don't you mean his big sister? No, I'm his younger sister. Younger sister? But how? Because 14 years have passed since then... Idiot Shinji. Asuka! Am I glad to see you! I knew you were okay, Asuka! It's no use, I can't hold it in. I've kept it pent up all these years. What's gotten into you? Pent-up rage and sorrow. What are you talking about? Asuka, what happened to your eye? "What happened" is none of your business. Asuka, you said it's been 14 years. But aside from the eye patch, you look the same. Yeah, that's the Eva's curse. Curse? Hey, wait a second! Asuka, you would know, right? Tell me! Where's Ayanami?! No idea. No idea? But I saved her! Such a fuss over one person. One person means jack in this world now. Isn't that right, Colonel Katsuragi? Asuka! Misato, where's Ayanami? Tell me, please! Shinji, you need to understand that Rei Ayanami doesn't exist anymore. No, I know that I saved her! I'm sure she's still inside Unit 01's entry plug! You have to look for her! We've already searched every inch of Unit 01's interior. All we found were you, and... this, which had been reconstructed somehow. Nothing unusual could be detected, so you can have it back. This is Dad's... Ayanami had this with her. I did save her! What was that?! It's me. Bogey on the aft upper deck! It came out of nowhere! It must be the real deal. All hands, battle stations condition 1! - Priority One on safeguarding Unit 01! - Unit 08 is ready to go, right? You betcha! I'm going as we speak, Highness! So, how was our little puppy? Did he sit still like a good doggy? He hadn't changed one bit. His hair and face, goofy as ever. But wasn't it that goofy face of his that you wanted to see? As if! I went down there to belt him one! I feel better now! Misato! Ritsuko! What's out there? A new Angel? Shinji. Where are you? Ayanami? You heard Ayanami's voice just now, right?! Misa... Damn it, what the hell?! We're ready to go! Mr. Ikari, come with me! Shinji. Where are you? It is Ayanami... It's Ayanami! Mr. Ikari, hurry! I've had enough... Ayanami! I'm here! Eva Unit 00? Shinji, come here. No, Shinji! You stay put. What the hell, Misato? You just said that you don't need me! Maybe not, but we're keeping you in protective custody. You're being impossible! - Stop! That's an Eva you're firing at! - That's why we're shooting! We're going to exterminate all of Nerv's Eva Units. Nerv's? Isn't this Nerv? No, we're Wille, an organization dedicated to the destruction of Nerv! What...? But... But Ayanami's piloting that Eva! No she's not! Rei Ayanami doesn't exist anymore, Shinji. You're lying! She's right here! How can you be so blind?! I've had enough of this! Mr. Ikari! Leave if you want, but whatever you do, don't pilot no more Evas, all right? Seriously, I couldn't handle that again! Don't let them escape, Four-Eyed Crony. You got it! When I aim... I don't miss! Hey, c'mon! Gotcha! I knew it, it's Adams' Vessel! Hey, I'm talking to you! Show some manners, bitch! If Nerv chose him over Unit 01, it means he is still a potential trigger! Misato! Activate the DSS choker! XO to Bridge. Break off pursuit. All hands are to continue damage control and fitting of the ship. Roger, disengaging pursuit. All stations, continue repairs. This Shinji is less of an idiot and more like a brat. Evangelion New Theatrical Edition: Q I did save Ayanami... Misato, you liar... Follow me. Um... We're inside the Geofront, but I can see the sky? That's Nerv HQ? What happened here? It really has been 14 years. We're here. What's that? - An Eva? - That's right. Father? Evangelion Unit 13. It is yours and this other pilot's. The boy playing the piano earlier? When the time comes, you are to pilot the Eva with him. That is all. Wait, Father! I still have lots of questions! I need to talk to you! Father! There's no dial, so I guess I can't call anyone from this end. I have to go thank her. Ayanami! Where are you, Ayanami? Ayanami! What is this place? Ayanami? I finally found her! Ayanami! I've been looking everywhere for you! Hey! Clothes! Come on, put on some clothes! If it's an order, I will. Ayanami I'm coming in. Oops. Uh, Ayanami... Thank you for this. I've been meaning to thank you for a while. Oh, that's a new plug suit. It looks good on you, but the black is a bit... So, a lot has changed around here at Nerv HQ, huh? Why is Misato fighting Nerv instead of the Angels? What's Father trying to do here? What happened to everyone? Ayanami, do you know anything? I don't know. Oh. I suppose you wouldn't. So, when did you make it out of Unit 01? This isn't even a proper room. I suppose it fits you, but still... They don't have school here, right? What do you do all day? I wait for orders. Um, I don't see any books here. Don't you read any? Books? Would Rei Ayanami read books? Sure, you used to read all the time. You had some in your room. Oh. I know! I'll find the library and bring you some. Are English books okay? You always had one with you and seemed to like them. - Like them? - Yeah. At least, I think you did. What is "like"? Seele is remaining tight-lipped? The Human Instrumentality Project will be enacted as per the Dead Sea Scrolls. They have no further need to interact with us. Ikari, do you intend to use Unit 13 this time? No matter. I'll go along with your plans. For Yui's sake. It's no use. It's busted. - Don't do anything. - It's none of your business. - Don't pilot no more Evas, all right? - Pilot the Eva. I don't know. Come on down, Ikari. Let's talk. Um, I thought we were going to talk. A piano duet is a conversation using musical scales. Give it a try. No, I'm not cut out for this. In life, it's important to embrace change and try new things. It's simple. All you have to do is hit the keys over here. Go ahead, play something. I like it! Our sounds work well together. Sounds are so much fun. It's great to play together. Thank you. It's been a while since I last enjoyed myself like this. Same here. Let's do this again. You're welcome anytime... Shinji Ikari. Uh, what's your name? I'm Kaworu. Kaworu Nagisa. I'm another child like you, burdened by fate. She's not here again. The books haven't been touched. Good morning, Shinji Ikari. You're up early. Well, I've got nothing else to do. What can I do to play better? Playing better isn't important. Just create sounds that feel good to you. I want to play better sounds, then. How do I do that? Practice through repetition. Do the same thing over and over. Do it until you can think to yourself, "That's pretty good." That's the only way. Sure, leave it to me. You want me to fix this, right? Yes, thank you. I feel bad about asking this. You've already done so much. Don't worry about it. That's what friends are for. It's getting dark. Let's call it a day. Why don't we stay here a little longer? Let's watch the stars. The stars? You like the stars? Ever since I was little, taking in the vastness of the cosmos... has always relaxed me. It makes me happy, knowing that 14 years means so little up there. It's like I can lose myself, knowing I don't matter. It's soothing, I guess... It's hard to explain. The sentiment came across just fine. Shunning change, you prefer the empty, merciless world of the abyss. That's very much you. Lying outside with you is nice. I never realized this could be so pleasant. Thank you for inviting me. Don't mention it, I just thought, um... watching the stars with you might be fun. It is fun. I realize now that I was born to meet you. This one's a little big on me... Tohji Suzuhara Here you are. It works now. Thank you. You're amazing. It seems like you can do anything. It's only a matter of technical knowledge. I've been on this Earth a little longer than you, that's all. Still... You're amazing. You seem depressed. What's wrong? I'm worried... About my friends. Your friends? There used to be a city above Nerv HQ. They all lived there. Tohji, Kensuke, our class president, and everyone else. I guess I was asleep inside Unit 01 for 14 years. And everything changed while I was away. It must be hard for you to cope with all that change. I'm afraid... I'm afraid, not knowing what happened to everyone. To the city. I'm terrified! You want to know? Nagisa! Nagisa! We're almost there. The clouds will break soon. You'll be able to see the truth you're after. What is this...? The result of the Third Impact, which happened while you were fused with Unit 01. Then... The city and everyone in it are... Mass extinctions aren't a rare occurrence on this world. On the contrary, they spur on evolution. After all, life-forms transform themselves to adapt to their world. But the Lilin, they transform the world instead of themselves. And so, they created a rite in order to artificially evolve. Sacrificing the life-forms of the past in order to create a new life-form imbued with the fruit of life. This extinction is all part of a program hard-coded into all life in antiquity. Nerv called it the Human Instrumentality Project. Nerv did this...? What was my father trying to do? Shinji Ikari. Once awakened, Eva Unit 01 opened the Gates of Guf and acted as the trigger to bring about the Third Impact. The Lilin call it the Near Third Impact. You were the key to it all. No... I just wanted to save Ayanami. Perhaps. But that caused this. No... How was I supposed to know?! It's all too much! I can't do anything about this! True, it's a horrific past that you can't do anything about. This is the truth that you wanted to know. As a consequence, the Lilin made you bear the wages of that sin. Isn't that what that thing on your neck represents? Sin? I haven't done anything! I have nothing to do with this! Even if you don't, that's not how others see it. But there are no sins that can't be atoned for. There is hope. There is always hope. Seele's Boy has made contact with the Third Boy. He's shown him the outside world. I wonder how he will take it. Are you sure about this, Ikari? We will rewrite Seele's script. Any and all beings are tools to that end. You feel that opening up to your son isn't in his best interests? I don't agree. What the hell? How did this happen? Well, at least I saved Ayanami. That's what matters. She's still not here. And she hasn't touched these. What's going on? What's happened to Ayanami, damn it?! Third Boy, can you play Japanese chess? Well, I know the rules. That's fine. Come with me. I'll play at a handicap to even the odds. Calm yourself to achieve inner serenity. That's an important part of winning a battle. Checkmate in 31 moves. This should make for a more enjoyable game. Thank you for humouring this old man. I'm a coward, you see. I needed an excuse to have a chat with you. Do you remember your mother? No, I was very young when she died. And my father threw away everything related to my mother. This woman, it's... Ayanami? That's your mother. Her maiden name was Yui Ayanami. She was one of my students. She's now part of Eva Unit 01's pilot interface. Good, power has finally been restored. That is the very early version of the Eva control system. Yui envisioned a direct core entry system, and she tested it herself. You saw it when it happened, although your memory has been wiped. It ended with Yui disappearing in there, leaving only her data behind to become the Ayanami series. The Rei Ayanami you knew is one of the replicas of Yui. Along with your mother, she, too, is now trapped inside Unit 01. It's all part of your father's plans. No... Breaking apart the world is a trivial matter. Rebuilding it, however, is not so easy. Just as one can't turn back the clock, one can't reset the world. Nor the human heart. That is why your father is sacrificing everything to make his wish come true. Including his very soul. I wanted to share some truths with you. And tell you about your father. What a wretched role to play... Yui, is this what you wanted? The time of the final pact is coming. We'll be together again soon, Yui. Why don't you read the books? I wasn't ordered to. Ordered... Fine! Forget it, then! Listen, you're Ayanami, right? Yes, I'm Rei Ayanami. You're the one I saved, right?! I don't know. Shinji... I didn't save you... Ayanami... Don't do anything. - Father... - I don't know. Pilot the Eva. Don't pilot no more Evas! - Mother... - Don't pilot no more Evas! - It's none of your business. - Pilot the Eva. Don't pilot no more Evas! Misato... - I don't know. - Don't do anything. - Pilot the Eva. - It's none of your business. Don't pilot no more Evas! - Pilot the Eva. - It's none of your business. - Pilot the Eva. - It's none of your business. - Pilot the Eva. - Don't pilot no more Evas! - It's none of your business. - Don't do anything. It's none of your business. Don't pilot no more Evas! - I don't know. - Pilot the Eva. What have I been doing...? So the final executor has been completed at last. Yes, all the tools are now ready. The time has come. This is our moment, Shinji Ikari. No! I don't want to pilot an Eva anymore! I didn't save Ayanami! Nothing good has ever come from me piloting an Eva! I'm sick of it! I don't want to do anything! Nothing good will come from sitting here like this, replaying a traumatic refrain in your life. Nothing good ever happens! You showed it to me! That red, desolate world... Change brought about by an Eva can be changed again with an Eva. I can't trust anything anymore! Not the Evas, Father, or Misato! But at least trust me. I can't! Misato and the others put this thing on me. They said to never pilot an Eva again. Threatened to kill me if I did. I don't care about Evas anymore. I understand. I'll take the Lilin's curse and the risk of the Eva awakening on myself. Nagisa... Don't worry about it. The Lilin made this because they were afraid of me. I planned to do this sooner or later. Shinji Ikari. Your hope rests with the two spears left at ground zero inside the Central Dogma. They are the key to the activation of the Human Instrumentality Project. All we have to do is take those spears. That way, Nerv won't be able to bring about a Fourth Impact. And when used with Unit 13, the spears will allow us to repair the world. You're right. If anyone can do it, it's you. No, it's us. Unit 13 uses a double entry plug system. Together, we'll give hope to the Lilin. What you need most of all right now is hope. As well as redemption and peace of mind. You're amazing. You know everything. That's because all I think about is you. Thank you, Nagisa. Call me Kaworu. In that case, call me Shinji. It's just like on the piano. Good things come when we play together... Shinji. Let's do this, Kaworu. Evangelion Unit 13, activate! Signal detected! A new Eva unit has been activated! We're not doing this by ourselves? You mean the Mk. 9? It's here for backup. Nerv is worried about Wille. We can handle them just fine without her. She's not Ayanami, anyway. I'm not Ayanami? The wall, they're... These are the ones that failed to merge with the Infinite. You don't have to worry about it. We're almost at Lilith's seal. It's completely blocking the main shaft, preventing anyone from entering these past 14 years. It's like a huge lid. Don't worry. Unit 13's purpose is to breach it. Together, we can do it. Synchronize our tempos, just like when playing a duet. Let's do this, Shinji. We're through! Here we are. The bottommost level of the Central Dogma. Ground zero of the Third Impact. Is that Lilith? What used to be. Now, it's only a carcass. Misato was willing to sacrifice her own life to protect it... Is that an Eva? Yes, Eva Mk. 6. The sad end of the unit altered by the Lilin to function autonomously. Those things sticking through her... Those are what we're after? Yes, Longinus and Cassius. Two souls are needed to retrieve the two spears. Hence the double entry plug system. If they needed two souls, why didn't they just use her? No, a facsimile made by the Lilin wouldn't work. The seat of her soul isn't in the same place. All right, let's get started. Wait a minute. Something's not right. What is it, Kaworu? This is strange. The two spears have changed shape to resemble each other. Let's pull them out. That's why we're here. What the hell was that?! Unit 02?! Asuka?! What are you doing, Asuka?! Idiot Shinji! Don't tell me you're piloting that Eva?! Yes I am, and I'm going to change the world with it. Damn brat... You can help by not piloting an Eva! You're always late with your cover fire! Sorry, my bad! Okay, Adams' Vessel... At the very least, I'm going to slow you down some, kiddo. Why are you stopping me, Asuka?! Those spears are our only hope! Stop trying to help! You'll only make things worse! Brat Shinji, do you want to start another Third Impact?! No! If we had those spears, we could start everything over! We could save the world! You are such a naive brat... You never listen! I could use some help, Kaworu! We need a matched set of spears, Cassius and Longinus. Instead, all we have here are two identical spears. Kaworu! So that's it... That's your plan, Lilin! Hello, Seele's stand-in pilot. I know you can hear me. I suggest you clear out of there before you become part of Adams' Vessel. I can't. I wasn't ordered to. You're so uptight... You know, your original was a lot easier to get along with. Original? A different me? Kaworu! What's gotten into you?! Asuka, please! Stop getting in my way! Shut up and let me kill you, Brat Shinji! Damn it, not now! Four-Eyed Crony! Spare! Gotta get the spears now! How dare you strike a woman... You bastard... Spare incoming! Let's stop, Shinji. I have a bad feeling about this. We can't stop now, Kaworu! What did we come all this way for? You need to let it go. Those aren't the spears we need. What do you mean, not the spears we need? You said we needed these spears! That's why I got into this Eva! My control systems! I'll take those spears for you... For everyone... And then the world will go back to normal! And then even Misato will have to... Oh, crap! Four-Eyed Crony, you have a clear shot! Use of AA rounds granted! Good deal. Here comes something special! It doesn't have an AT Field... Wait a second, don't tell me this thing is... - Don't do this, Shinji... - Stop it, you stupid brat! Let's begin, Fuyutsuki. The Eva Mk. 6? Pattern Blue? What's going on? Crap! The 12th Angel isn't dead yet! Four-Eyed Crony, No. 3 Container! Alrighty! Before the Third Impact can restart, I'm gonna finish this thing off! This was in my orders. An Angel?! Don't waste your ammo, Highness. That whole thing is a core. We haven't got a chance. Besides, I'm curious to see what'll happen after the final Angel is beaten. What is this? This is... me. Then what am I? The controls aren't responding! What happened, Kaworu?! Kaworu! To think that I, the 1st Angel, would be reduced to being the 13th... What are you talking about, Kaworu?! So, the beginning and the end are one and the same. Well played, King of the Lilin. Shinji's father... Pattern Blue detected by the DSS? But there shouldn't be a 13th! So this is what Gendoh was after! The time has come to revise the pact set down in the Dead Sea Scrolls. This is farewell. Though your souls may have taken on a different form, you are still products of the forbidden fruit. Though it may be possible to live eternally, death must come to you as it does to us. In your quest to assist the evolution of those burdened with mortality, you gave us civilization. On behalf of all humanity, I express our gratitude. With your deaths, I will return your souls to where they belong. I shall carry out your cherished Human Instrumentality Project, as well as the deicide that you were resigned to. Please rest peacefully. Our goals have already been met. It is good. All is very good. We hope for humanity's instrumentality to be realized. Let their souls be peacefully cleansed. This thing's going beyond the Pseudo DMS Phase! It's awakened, all right. Must be a straggler Adam! What is this? What the hell is this? Is this my fault? Because I pulled out the spears? Is this... The Fourth Impact. This is its opening rite. Kaworu, the choker! Misato?! AT Field at maximum strength! Seal the Eva inside it! All main guns, ready salvo! Load high-angle rounds! We'll do whatever it takes to prevent a Fourth Impact! Fire! We're hit! Direct hits to main guns! Adams' Vessel?! Central block hit! Damage unknown! New-model Eva is breaking free! Helm not responding! We're going down! Central block hit again! The Adams' Vessel was the Wunder's original master. It's trying to take back control of this ship from Eva Unit 01. Why won't the control link come back online? Oof... Uh-oh... What a mess we've got going up here. Four-Eyed Crony, you handle the brat! I'll rescue the Wunder! Roger that! Unable to dislodge Adams' Vessel! Unidentified data infiltrating the central control system! We're losing control of the ship! No fair! Seele's playing dirty tricks again. Change modes! Code Triple Seven. - Who are you? - No, who the hell are you?! Lookouts report Unit 02 Improved is engaging Adams' Vessel! I'm counting on you, Asuka... What would Rei Ayanami do at a time like this? How would I know?! What do you want to do?! I can hit the core now! What? This entire thing is a core?! I'm out of time... Sorry, Unit 02! Control systems back online! Emergency take-off! Pursue target Eva immediately! Captain, we have to get the main engine online first! Shinji... Is it my fault...? Did I... Did I do this...? It's not your fault. It happened because I turned into the 13th Angel. I'm the trigger. What should I do? Please, what should I do? Kaworu, I... What am I supposed to do now? Even when a soul is lost, its aspirations and curses remain in this world. Human will is conveyed as information throughout the world, and changes it. In time, we rewrite who we are. I'm sorry. This isn't the happiness that you were hoping to find. I'll close the Gates of Guf. You don't have to worry, Shinji. Kaworu... I don't understand anything you're saying, Kaworu! Shinji, you need to find a place to rest that you can call your own. The ties that bind you will show you the way. Don't look so sad. We'll meet again, Shinji. Kaworu! The Gates of Guf aren't closing yet! Our little doggy must be Seele's insurance policy! Everything's wrapped up! Snap out of it, Doggy! Stop being a baby! At least save the Princess! Man up! And learn a thing or two about life while you're at it! What a mess. This is almost exactly what Seele wanted. Perhaps, but we neutralized Seele's Boy and awakened Unit 13. Colonel Katsuragi also acted according to plan. For now, this is acceptable. All stations, remain on alert condition 2. Pattern Blue no longer detected. No contacts in alert airspace. Damaged central block areas, damage control complete. I don't know how or why, but a Fourth Impact was averted. Misato. For now, let's call it a win. Hey, Brat Shinji. You didn't come help me. All you do is think about yourself. You think shutting up is the answer. You're still acting like a baby! No matter how many years pass, you're still the same old annoying brat! Here, put this on. Geez! You can at least stand up, can't you?! Hey, you're that pilot. One of the original Ayanami batch, huh? The L containment field density is too strong for them to rescue us here. Let's move to a spot where the Lilin can come for us. Come on! To be continued Preview Having lost his will to live, Shinji Ikari wanders aimlessly. The place he ends up helps him regain hope. The Human Instrumentality Project is finally initiated. Wille begins the final showdown to stop the Final Impact. The Wunder streaks through the sky. Eva Unit 08 plus 02 race across the red lands.
