I've been coming from far away. I'm miles from anywhere, just another day... So hold me up. Come on, hold me up. Can't you hear me calling? The way the clouds move. Here they come, they're big and black. --Here they come, they're big and black. And that's the sound of the man who's working on his way back. And now she comes to me. Yeah she comes to me at last. And now she comes to me. She comes to me at last. And I was waiting, I was waiting, like an empty glass. And I was waiting, I was-- OK, I'm done Mrs. Markey! I'm done. A thousand little pieces fall to the ground and pass through my fingers on their way down. Talk about the dreams of a younger man. You can't miss something you never had. Am I just too young to know? Too naive to let it go? Tired of all the love songs that don't speak to me. Tired of the birds singing outside my window. Tired of the sun shining down on me-- Holden Caulfield. He is-- naive. and he is resentful of the adult world. Pieces of my broken heart. Falling down. Pieces of my fragile pride. Falling down. Memories of you and I are falling down-- --Thank you. Goodnight. Mom, did you call Professor Green again? --Honey, "Catcher In The Rye"!? That's high school material, isn't it? I thought we agreed you would stop checking up on me. --And I know Peter's demanding, but he's just trying to get the best out of you. If you can just try to be more punctual. Mom, he's got me working in the science building. It's on the other side of campus. --And save the creative energy for your dissertation. Wait, what did he say about that? Richard, I love your music. You know that. But you lost a lot of time with that, and you're not a kid anymore. If you can just stay focused for a few more months, you'll have your doctorate, and you can get a tenured position, benefits. You've got all weekend to work on your dissertation. So promise me you won't do any music. --Richard? What's that sound? Is your phone acting up again? Mom, I'm still here. --There you are. I thought I'd lost you for a moment. Oh, my god. Richard? Are you there? Holy shit, dude. You all right? That was fucking close. Richard? Are you all right? Sorry. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la. Oh, sorry. I was just digging the music, and-- uh, uh. Do you work at Carlin University? I'm a student there, and I teach-- I knew it. I'm the guy who nearly killed you with the tree branch yesterday. Uh, it's getting more awkward, isn't it? Sorry, I'm Greg. Um, how did you-- Wow. Wow. That is some old school business right there. Whoa. Oh, my goodness. I had exactly the same boombox when I was a kid. Is that yours? Yeah, cassettes are better for the-- No, no, no, no. I mean the song. --I'm working on it. Oh, wow. You play too? Guitar, a little bit. That song you were playing about the empty glass, is that yours too? That's just-- No. No, no, no, no, no. You're kidding me. That's not a-- This is your throwaway song? You've got to play me some songs you keep. Would you mind-- nice guitar-- would you mind playing this for me? I'd love to hear it without the door in the way. OK. All right. Here, do you want these? Oh, my god. That's an interesting picking pattern. Do you mind? I have an idea for-- it's in E? That's nice. What's next? There's a bunch of changes. These ones? I've been a coming from far away. I'm miles from anywhere. Another day-- That I rest my mind singing songs with the old ones. So hold me up. Come on. Hold me up. Can't you hear me calling? The way the clouds move, here they come, they're big and black. And I was waiting, I was waiting like an empty glass. --What's this? Yeah, so fill me up. Come on and fill me up. From your loving cup, baby. From your loving cup. Oh. To drink you down, yeah. Ah. It's her nap time-- Mrs. Markey. At 4 PM? She takes a lot of naps. That's all right, I have to get back to work. Wait, You've got to be kidding. We gotta keep this going, man. I-- I don't think so. Come on. Grab your guitar. This is you? That's embarrassing. I've never seen you before-- and you live 25 feet away. That's-- I thought I saw a young woman move in here recently. Oh yep. That was me. She's in Ohio. Come on. I have a little place down here where we can play. That's where I was headed when I heard you. Cool. Like a studio? --Mother fucker. I'm sorry. Do you mind? Mother-- hey! Hey! Hey! Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Hey! Hey! You-- yeah, you better run. You little shits. Phew. Juvenile delinquents. Don't you have parents? Parole officers? They steal anything? No, they just keep breaking in to smoke pot. Come on. I'm going to introduce you. Bonnie Blue-- used to tour with her, but the band broke up. And now she doesn't exactly run anymore, but here-- pop right up on the seat there. She's a bit more Babylon than Bonnie right now, but she was once the glorious grand dame of the high road. Can you hold this for a second? Oh, it doesn't usually smell this-- this good. Thank you. Alrighty. Oh wow. Cool. Wait a minute-- those little fucks. What? My cell phone is gone. What the fuck is this? Oh, those little miscreants. Oh, man. That could have been bad. Want me to call the police? No, no. I fucking hate those cell phones anyway. Digital destroyed music. And now it's hell bent on destroying the rest of civilization. Remember when you couldn't be reached in your car? when It was a place you went to listen to cassettes and not be reached. Afraid to admit it-- woah, I think I have a second-hand high. You want a first? No, I don't really-- No, I don't either, man. I totally quit, but the universe just took away my cell phone and handed me the ultimate analog time machine. So-- Here. Take it. Take it. Take it. Hit that. Surprisingly strong. You OK? Those kids, man. She's in Ohio you said, right? Your girlfriend? Oh, my-- yeah, yeah. She had a little family emergency, so she sat in Columbus at her folks' house. Oh, I'm sorry. No, no. If I can get Bonnie here back on her feet again, I might drive out there to surprise her and cheer her up, you know? How far is it to Eagle Rock? The Folk Festival? I don't know. Pretty close, I would guess. Why? Oh, it's stupid. A couple of days ago, the booker from the festival called out of the blue. You got a gig at Eagle Rock? Whoa. Hey, that's soon, isn't it? No, I can't do it. I've got classes, dissertation. But for some reason, I couldn't bring myself to tell him I'd quit music. Dude, dude, this is, uh-- this is karma. No, wait a minute. Karma? Kismet, maybe? Yes, that's what I meant-- Kizment. I'm going to take you there. We'll get Bonnie back on the road. Honestly, I can't do it. I-- What? My advisor, he wants me to work from that weekend. He's weirdly obsessed with-- On the weekend? Fuck that, man. This is Eagle Rock, man. You can't play that shit. It's just the second stage. And the thing is, we can go pick up my girl in Columbus. We could all go over there. She will love it. Oh, man. Who are those kids? Who are those fucking kids? All right. What else do you got for me, my friend? Me? No, no-- you play me something. No, no. I don't-- I really don't have-- Bull. I just write stuff for my girl that's-- Ah-ha. Play it. Oh, fuck. All right. This is something that I, um-- this is something I'm working on. This old house is cracked and worn. The walls are faded and the curtains torn. Sometimes, it feels like we're running just to keep falling behind. And although the radio plays only a storm, still somewhere I hear the downbeat of a drum. Dance with me to this song. Dance now, darling, let your hair run down. Dance with me, oh, all night long. Dance now, darling, to this-- song. Come to me darling put your hand in mine. Lay your head down on my shoulder. Give me your lips. Sweet like wine. If a kiss, is just a kiss. I don't know what to make of this. Don't know where, but I hear the beat of a drum. Somewhere I swear-- Mrs. Markey, hi! I hear the strains of a song. Dance with me to this song. Dance now, darling. Let your cares be gone. Dance with me all night long. Dance now, darling, to this song. Oh, wow. All right. All right. All right. --Put it in the bag. Can you help me with the top? Yeah. Pull this thing off. Rasta ganja brotherhood? Fucking kids. If you're stuck, and you feel like you can't move. And your spirit's sinking low. As long as you can sing, baby you got wings. So maybe you just gotta go and call in sick to work. You don't owe anything to that jerk. Take some time to get a little sunshine. Oh, oh, take it easy. Gotta take it easy... Sorry. Is this distracting you? No, I love it. Is that your girlfriend singing too? Yep. What happened? Um, she got a real job. Couldn't travel anymore. The rest of the band? Ah, bands, man. They're like polygamist marriages. Somebody's getting too much. Somebody's getting too little. I don't know. Oh, look under the seat right there. See that? So I'm thinking we get the generator running, power up those batteries, find a nice quiet spot, and we record your next album-- Songs From Inside Bonnie. Thanks. I'm serious. Thanks, for everything. But I think this is the last ride, if you know what I mean. What? You don't write like that and not share it with the world. What's the definition of insanity? Or as Dylan says, what's the sound of one hand clapping? Listen, man. I've been down the same road, and I've been in the bottom of your empty glass. I got this great girl I want to be worthy of. We want to have a family, all that. So finally, I got a real job. Pays the bills, benefits, pension. Wasn't my dream, just like being an English professor isn't yours. But-- Wait. Your tree job pays benefits? No-- I got fired from the job I'm talking about, but the point is-- you do what you gotta do so you can keep making music-- weekends, nights, whatever. But guys like us, we don't stop making music. That's the definition of insanity. The Big Time Crush, huh? Ah. Band names are impossible. All the good ones have been taken, so you end up with bad sentences. That's true. I suppose we need a name for Eagle Rock? Well, we're already Rasta Ganja Brotherhood, right? Oh, wow. Hitchhiker. You don't see that much anymore. You gotta have a death wish. Yeah, or be a psycho killer. Got kind of a hippie thing going, though. Like a neo hippie. The Neo Hippies? Wait. What are you doing? There's not a lot of hippie psycho killers. One notable exception. Charles Manson! Come on-- Go, go, go. --Thanks. How you doing? I'm Greg, and that's Rich. Glad we saw you there. You could have frozen to death out there, huh? It's not too bad. All right. So you know, I asked for you. And unfortunately, it looks like we got the last room in town. I'm really sorry. It was nice meeting you. I'd offer you the van but, without the generator working, I'm afraid that you'd freeze to death-- You know, we could ask for a cot to be rolled in. Right on. Night, Rich. Night, Greg. What are you doing? Couldn't sleep. So you left me in here-- wait, where did he go? He was here when I left? His stuff's gone, though. Lock the door. Oh, man. Scary hippie massacre dreams. You been working on the song? I think I finished the second verse and have a little idea for the bridge. Check it out. Let's try it. I was hoping you'd say so. How about something like this upfront? I like it. Oh-- Whoa, whoa. Oh. Morning. Morning. Hey. Oh, oh-- Oh, when you're gone? The night is cold as it is long. And the hurt that made you humble, want to write about, is the love that made you crumble from the inside out. I believe in a new day to come, that it's always darkest before the dawn. Moving in slow motion, baby, still I'm moving on. Yeah, yeah. Moving in slow motion, babe. Still, I'm moving on. Sounds nice. Yeah, nice. What's next? Second verse. Oh, I can see there ain't no magic words to set you free. Still, I'm hoping you are gonna take me as I am, even though I am a fool and such a stubborn man. I believe in a new day to come, that it's always darkest before the dawn. Moving in slow motion baby. Still, I'm moving on. I left New England for the city life. Oh, I got songs I wanna sing. Yeah, I like that. Then something-- I don't know what the second part is, but back to-- Yeah, I got songs I wanna sing. Hm, hm. Yeah I was an Army brat who didn't care about guns. Just axes? And you know, that and all the moving around, I just gave up making friends and started playing the guitar. Listen. I don't know when you need to be wherever it is you're headed, but if Eagle Rock, Ohio isn't too far out of your way, why don't you come with us? Play the show with us tomorrow. I mean, we're picking Greg's girlfriend up in Columbus. That gives us a day in the van to rehearse. Are you going to play that song for her? Oh, I don't think it's ready. We better make it ready. I wanna see the look on her face when we rock that baby. Is that a yes? Yeah. All right, then! I'm going to give Bonnie her vitamins, and then we'd better head out. Yeah, I'll get this stuff. Do you think anyone would notice if we took a little for the road? You mean, like this? Come on, dude. Hey. Sorry if I freaked you guys out last night. Please, you probably had a early stage hypothermia. No, but you two definitely came along at the right moment. Ah. We can't leave without-- I just realized I don't even know your name. It's Brian. Hey, Rich. What are you doing? We gotta go, bud. That is weird. Well, until we think of something better-- Hey. What are you doing? Hello, dear. It's been a while. You still got the same smile that stops me in my tracks. And you're wearing your hair a new way. Well, it's not my taste, but you're beautiful anyway. I think I'm writing a love song for you. And I'll sing it out, even if you walk away. So that's her place? Yep. This could take a few minutes, and I have to pack her up. I've got to do some work. Yeah, take your time. OK. Thanks. You want one? Uh, no. Thanks. Mind if I? Uh, no. Whoa. I did not see that coming. She's a bit older, huh? Oh. Well, that makes more sense. She's pretty. You guys been together long? Who? You and Greg? Uh, we kind of just met, really. Really? You guys sound great together. It's pretty cool. Everything all right? Is your girlfriend coming? I think we're just a few hours out of Eagle Rock now, guys. If you find a motel up there, we can stop. Why don't we sleep in here? Uh, it's a bit cold without the generator, I think. Check this place out. Look at that-- "Music Night" It's a sign. Yeah, literally. And if you feel foolish, just set it aside. And put one foot forward tonight. Have a seat. Do you guys want a beer? Not for me, thanks. Yeah. Right on. There's some food left over too, if you want it. Come on and put one foot forward tonight. And put one foot forward tonight. Who the fuck are you? Come to me, darling, put your hand in mine. Lay your head down on my shoulder. Give me your lips, sweet like wine. If a kiss is just a kiss. I don't know what to make of this. Although the radio plays only a storm. Still somewhere, I hear the downbeat of a drum. So dance with me to this song. Dance now, darling, let your cares be gone. Dance with me all night long. Dance, now darling, to this song. Ah. Check out this little baby, huh? She was a friend of mine. She was a friend of mine. Roll down the river. She was a friend of mine. Roll down the river, roll where you can. Roll down. It all comes back again. Whew! All right! Guys? Hey, guys! Um, yes? You'd better come downstairs. What's wrong? No idea. Oh, man. Guys, you'd better come now. I asked you to stay with the vehicle. You know what? I don't have to do anything you say, OK? I've asked you to remain with the vehicle. You know, it doesn't even matter. I'm on private property. You can't just roll up, wake me up-- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I can. No, you can't, man. Oh, you think it's because you have a badge, you can just make shit up? This is bullshit. I need you to calm down. You need to go back to the academy, dude, because you were asleep the day they talked about civil rights. Do either of you know this man? Um, what's the problem? Who's the owner of this vehicle? I need your license and registration, please. Whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't a traffic stop. He doesn't have to show you anything. Brian, it's totally cool. There's nothing to hide here, OK? That's not the point. Sir, you need to stand down now. Stand down. What the fuck does that even mean, stand down? Yeah, well, I know sitting down, and I know standing up, OK? But how do I "stand down"? I mean, the last I checked, we speak English in America, OK? And we had this little thing. It's called the Constitution. All right. You stay here. Maybe you can calm your friend down. I'll be right back. This fucking guy-- Brian, what's going on? Yeah. Let's maybe chill a bit and, uh-- do you wanna put some pants on? Hey, Copper. I'm gonna put some pants on. Or is that going to be a problem too? Tampering with evidence. Failure to stand down. Concealing a weapon, maybe. Look, guys, there's no law in America that says you can't sleep in a van on private property, OK? He's profiling. He can't do anything to me for out-of-state parking tickets, can he? That's just a misdemeanor, right? No. Parking tickets? That's an infraction. Doesn't even show up on NCIC. Look guys, I'm not trying to make trouble here, OK? He woke me up for no reason. And now he's totally overreaching. If we don't leave now, we're going to miss this gig. All right, look. Let's just be cool with him. And maybe he's gonna be cool with us, OK? So what brings you fellas to this area? We're playing the Eagle Rock Folk Festival. I see. Is that what this is? Oh, some kids graffiti'd that, and-- You don't have to answer him, OK? He's just fishing. I'm not talking to you, sir. No, but I'm talking to you, OK? Because we have free speech in America. Or seriously, did we take a wrong turn? What happened to being cool? You know what? And why am I the only one that gives a shit about our rights?! I'm going to give you one last chance to calm down, or you're coming with me. For what? For harassing a police officer, for one thing. Oh yeah, we're-- do you believe we're harassing him? I'm minding my own business. You come up to me. What the fuck is going on? Look. You're about to get arrested! Get off me! You want to let this asshole trample your rights? Fine! Am I free to go? Hey, are you gonna arrest me for sleeping? Or am I free to get my shit and walk? You can get your shit and go, please. Come on, Brian. Brian? Hey, where you going? Where-- where you going? He's a piece of work, huh? I'm sorry, Officer. We just met him, really. If everything's cool, we're just going to get our stuff. We're going to go. We're going to get him, and then we're going to get to our gig. Afraid I can't let you do that. Uh, you just said he was free to go. Yes, he is. But this van isn't. Registration on this vehicle has been revoked. And there's a warrant waiting for you, sir, when you get home. The only way this vehicle is going any place today is on the back of a tow truck. Your license. Excuse me a minute. Guess who's gonna tow me back tomorrow? Alvin, from the party last night. Are you serious? How funny is that? Oh, and they're actually going to let me sleep in the van tonight right here in the pound lot. OK. I mean, that is irony, huh? I mean, that is irony, right? Did you find a bus? Yeah. It leaves from just down there in about 15 minutes. Oh, wow. You better get going. Listen. Let me help you pay for the tow bill. Please. This is not your fault. No. You're tight. I can lend you some money. Kelly wired me. You spoke to her? Yeah. That wasn't funny or ironic. We're going through some shit right now, and she says that she's not re-upping her lease. But we're gonna work it out. Listen. You're probably going to be late, even as it is. Don't worry about me. I got Alvin and those guys. I'm going to meet them for drinks right down there in a few minutes, so I'm all good. Thanks. For what? For leaving you high and dry in bum fuck Ohio? For everything. Don't stop the music. Hey, "RGB"-- world's shortest lived band, huh? What'd I tell you? Oh-- Hi Mrs. Markey. Excuse me. Does this go too? Everything goes, man. Hi, Mom. I'm all right. Sorry, I spent the weekend in the library and the cell phone's on the fritz again. But I'm good. Actually, I've kind of turned over a new leaf, as Dad would say. And what did he say, by the way? The man who rises early feels honest? That's the right word, I think. You'll be happy to know I'm eating better, and making sure to get some exercise every day, and having some real breakthroughs with my undergrad students lately. Anyone? Anybody? Which is exciting. Anyone? Nobody? And you know, even Professor Green and I are-- How nice of you to join us. Well, I wouldn't say we're playing the same tune exactly yet, but I think there's a mutual thing happening there, which brings me to this point. You were right, Mom. Music wasn't good for me. In retrospect, I should have been able to read the signs on that one a long time ago. Call me after bingo tonight? Oh. Sorry. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. I used to live right next door. Yeah, I know. You're-- Oh, did we meet? Uh, no. We just passed in the hall. Well, I should have introduced myself. Anyway, I'm sorry to bother you, but would you mind terribly holding this for a friend to come pick up? I came back to tie up a few loose ends, and I was supposed to meet up with him. And I can't reach him, and I really want him to have this. But I can't leave it the hall. So-- Yeah, you bet. Thank you. Hopefully, I can reach him, and then he can come get it really soon. Of course, anytime. Thank you. Triple A Tree care. Yes, hi. Do you have someone named Greg working for you? No. No? No, sorry. OK. Thank you. Yes, hi. I'm looking for a friend named Greg. Does he work for you? No? Yes, hi. I'm looking for someone named Greg that might work for you. Yes. Yes, that's him. Do you know where he's working right now? She's been offered a new job. OK, that's good. In London. England. Sorry, man. I don't think she's really going to move to London. I think she's just trying to, um-- listen, thank you for bringing this to me. I think I'm kind of beat. I'm going to maybe take off, but I'll give you a call sometime soon, OK? What? You've got a phone? No. I'm saving up, but I'll give you a call. I should get going too, I guess. Gotta get back to my dissertation. Oh right. How's that going? Good. Two weeks till my defense. I got it. Oh, great. Yeah, I got it. No, no, no. No, no, please, I want to. Thanks, man. I'll put it toward the phone fund. Look, I'm going to hit the head on the way out. So if I don't catch you, you take care, all right, buddy? Hey, Greg. Do you want to call her? Take my phone. Seriously. Keep it overnight. The only person that calls this phone is my mom. If she calls, don't answer. Listen, I'm cool. Thank you, though, OK? Take care. I'm going to call you. Right? You too. Hey. Everything all right? You'll never believe this. I didn't know this place was down here. My love, I've run out of things to say. Neither one is right. Is it just a waste of time? Is this love worth the fight? Nice one, Brian. Holy shit. Guys, can we take a quick break. I recognized your voice immediately, but the rest of you not so much. Yeah, man. You look good. Thanks. How long you staying in town? Just till Friday. I'm crashing with James until he goes into the Army. The bassist. Whoa, as in the Army? You know, the music thing didn't really pan out. He needed to do something drastic. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. I never got your contact info. Hey, Bri--? It's time, man. Cool. Shoot. Can you guys hang out? Better yet, you guys should sit in. Oh, I, um-- Aw, come on. James would totally dig it. And the bar picks up in a little bit. So we have a couple more special guests tonight. I just met these guys, but Brian says great things about them. Let's get a round of applause for Rich and, uh-- Greg. Greg. Come on. Come on up, guys. So what are we gonna play? Do you guys remember that tune I was working on when I met you? Aw, come on. Emily, can we get a couple of frosty pints of liquid courage for my friends here? It was capo five. F to A minor. One, two. I've had this bike for years I patched the tubes. Fixed the gears Made the light shine bright to scare away the demons in the night. Rode by your house safe and warm. Looked in a window, but nobody was home. I know you left long ago. But the reasons why you left, nobody knows. Houses look different at night. Maybe it's the wine. Maybe it's the light. Take another spin around the block. Got nowhere to be. Sold my watch. The currency of love is counterfeit. You take that away, it still hurts a bit. I'd like to patch this hole inside my heart. I'm getting old. It's too late to start. It's too late to start. It's too late to start. It's too late to start. ...And we bid you good night. Good night. Oh, all right. James, you headed over to McClenon's? Yeah, let's do this. Bri, you coming? I'll see you in five. Good luck. Hey, be safe, all right? Guys, that was-- that was awesome. Let's not part without exchanging info. You got a phone now? Uh, no. Greg? Saving up. I guess you guys are going to have to call me. Well, here. Put your number down. I gotta pack up a few more things. Oh, hey. We'll be out in two minutes, OK? Can I help you? I think you already have. Gentlemen, my name is James Matthew Granmer, but my friends call me Granny. Granny? Granny. Granny. Listen. What the fuck were you guys doing? I just stopped in for 10 minutes just to escape. The last thing I expected was to find you guys. Oh, wow. --Thanks. Thank you. No, thank you. Shit. Shit. We've gotta go to this showcase. I don't even wanna go to it. What I want to do is stay here, find out more about you. Well actually, they're closing the bar. So we're walking out, if you want to join us. Yeah, that would be terrific. OK. I'll follow you. Who's seen you guys? Sorry. Who's seen us do what? You signed? Uh, no. Publishing? Uh, you mean publishing-- Got a publishing deal? This is actually our first gig together. You're bullshitting me. Georgie, this is their first gig together. I'm sorry. This is my friend, Georgie. Georgie loves you guys. He's got great ears. He's from Colombia. Oh, wow. Yeah. Listen. I get what you guys are doing. Three part harmony? Nobody does that anymore. It's very retro, but you're excellent. And I think your time is great, and I don't like anything. Ask Georgie. Am I right? No I-- What are you doing here? I don't like anything. But um-- was I just talking here? I was. I'm going to go settle up at the bar, OK? So you're from Columbia? Yes. A & R? Yes. Thank you, sweetheart. So you're visiting from L.A.? Yeah, just for the night. I have to see another show. Excuse me. Guys, do you mind if I steal this gentleman for a second? I have to run, but I got an idea. What do you say you do a showcase in LA. I'm thinking "The Troubadour"? Yeah. Wait. Like The Troubadour? Yeah. I think it sounds great. What do you think? Uh, well. LA is-- I'm sorry. Do you mind if we walk and talk? I follow you, because honestly, I don't know how I got down this rabbit shit hole. Listen, I'm busy the next 48, so we'll talk before I fly out. What's the name of your band anyway? Well, we've been using the name RGB. R & B? RGB. Rich, Greg, Brian. Yeah, but it's also red, green, blue, which are the only three colors that can be blended to create any color in the visible spectrum, or the aural spectrum in this case. All right. Yeah, great. We'll work on that. --Good night, gentlemen. Here's my card. How do I get in touch with you gentlemen? Oh, sorry. Here's my cell. OK, great. What about the bass player? Where'd he go? He's going into the Army. Well, that's probably for the best. How about your drummer? You got anybody with big boy drums? You mean for LA? Yeah, I think we're going to need it. Georgie? We're going to need drums, aren't we? We need percussion. Yeah, get the people tapping their toes. You'll work on that, right? I'll tell you-- look at him. Look at Georgie. He's all riled up. He never gets like this. You guys are great. OK, we'll talk to you. Give me a call, and we'll see you in LA. Good night, gentlemen. Good night. Hey, good night. The Troubadour! Interstellar Music Enterprises, Los Angeles, California. We can't do this, can we? Listen, I don't know if you guys believe in signs, or whatever, but this is crazy. I mean, isn't it? The whole thing. Good you're all there. Listen. I got you the gig. The Troubadour? --Wow. Awesome. Yeah. Well OK-- no. The Troubadour was booked. This is "Bob's Crepery". This is probably better though. Yeah. And the crepes are pretty good too. Now listen, please. The gig is Monday night. As in next Monday? I know. I know that's soon. But the record guys take off early for the holidays, you know? What holidays? --you're going to be on at 6:00, prime showcase hour. And the Melons are doing a special PR deal right after ya. The Melons? --Oh wow Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's great. Oh, listen-- I lined up a drummer! young studio cat, very hot right now. And he owes me. He's just going to just do simple percussion, keep it focused on the harmonies and the songs. Listen to me. I'm out of the country for the next couple of days. I'm gonna call you Saturday at noon to go over the details. Shit. I gotta take another call. OK, so come out here, and let's get you in front of some cats who can send this shit to Neptune. Damelo! Hey, cuidado! I mean, flights at this point would be?-- If we drive, we gotta leave like Thursday, at the latest. I'm gonna get fired, for sure. And you've got your classes and your dissertation thing, or whatever, right? I'm gonna need to do some laundry. We were walking down at Broadgate hall, yellow hat and your Cashmere shawl. A broken sky's turned gray. Bus stop squeals, and telephone wires, cafe lights on the Christ church spires. Somewhere, we lost our way. It's time we turn this ship around. Oh, I know, I know, I know. It's been too good for way too long to say goodbye. Hey, I mean every word I say, that it's been too good, for way too long to say goodbye, oh, say goodbye. Here you go. Take it all! No, this isn't enough. The paper said 600. No, it's $1,000. It was $600 a couple of weeks ago. $1,000 bucks? Now you got the storage. Now we got-- You think because you're a cop-- We'll meet you out there. This is ridiculous! Looking back on a faded photograph, on the walk by the boats where I made you laugh, there in my mind I go from time to time. Yes, I go from time to time. Oh, I know, I know, I know, it's been too good for way too long to say goodbye. --What the fuck is this? Let's go. Been too good way too long to say goodbye. Been too good way too long to say goodbye. It's been too good way too long to say goodbye. Is that the new song? Yeah. You've finished it already? I think so. Well, good news. He says he's gonna have us back on the road in the morning. Oh, and I asked about your generator part too, but there's no way we can get it in time. The phone work for you? Yeah. I have to go see her. OK. I mean, uh, we can stop by her folk's place on the way back. She's taking the job. Her folk's house is not too far off our route, so uh, I'm thinking I've got to go see her. What are you guys talking about? You know, we have to drive straight through now if we're gonna make it. You drop me at a bus station, you guys can head on in the van and, uh-- Wait. Are you quitting on us? No. I can catch a plane, hopefully, and still make it there in time. Time out. Leaving aside the issue of how we-- how you're going to pay for this, or if the flight's delayed or whatever, I mean, we have to rehearse. You've known about this job for weeks. What changed here? I didn't think she would take the job, but she flies out Monday. Oh, shit. London? Look. I don't want to let anybody down, but-- I'm beginning to see what happened with this relationship. I mean, this poor girl flew all the way to New York because, what? You went AWOL on her. And when I delivered the news about the job, you didn't care enough then to call her. So I'm having a hard time understanding why suddenly now you want to run to her when we're in the middle of this-- Because I made a vow. I'm sorry. You made a what? A vow. No no no... You said she was your girlfriend. No, you assumed that, and I just didn't correct you. Hey, Rich? Rich? Now where the hell's he going? Ah! He's here. Listen-- let me rap with him a minute, then I'll call you in. There you are. We've been looking all over for you. Man, that is a tough gig. I've played worse. They don't look very Mexican though, do they? No, they don't. They're good, though. Greg's outside. Dude, good news. The mechanic called his buddy at the junkyard, found the generator part. They're giving it to us for free. Do you really think you should be doing that? Didn't you-- didn't you quit drinking? I never started. I'm turning over a new leaf. In fact, the stuff's pretty good. You should try some. Speak of the devil, Greg, it that is his real name. Miss, can we have a cup of coffee, please? Black, for my friend here. Guys, we should-- we should have a band meeting. Band? Is that what this is? I've always wanted to be in a band. Hey, Rich? You have every right to be pissed at me. I'm sorry, man. I've been totally full of shit. And you're right. That's probably why my marriage is fucked beyond repair and why I probably fucked things up with my best friend now too-- both my best friends. I'll be right back, I have to pee. Rich, hold on. Hear him out. This is a shit soup all the way around. I'm pissed at Greg too, but that doesn't mean we can let him blow his marriage to roll the dice with us in LA. He has to go. No, no, no. I don't want to fuck things up for-- You're not. It's going to work out fine. Listen. I have an uncle, he works for the airlines. We'll work something out. We're going to make it work. Look. That's very cool, but the truth of the matter is I have no idea what I could even say to her at this point that's going to change anything. You're not going to say anything. Somebody said something once I never will forget. He said, love is like a blindfolded shot in the dark. Girl, when I met you I was back to the wall. With one last round, and I shot it straight from the heart. And I saw a spark. Yeah, I saw a spark. Somebody said something else once I never will forget. I was just a boy. But it stayed with me. She said, if you got something good, you got to hold on to it. So darling, won't you please come and stay with me and be my spark. And be my spark. Because I've been waiting so long for somebody, waiting for someone to melt free this frozen heart. Darling, won't you please be my silver spark? Oh, and burn in me. La, la, la, la, la, la... Now, I'm going to say something I hope you never will forget. Wherever you are and wherever I may be, as lost as I may seem, as cold as it may get, as old as we may be, hope you never will forget-- that you are my spark. You are my spark. You are my spark. Yeah, you are. You are spark! Yeah, you are my spark. Yeah, you are. Nah, nah, nah. I don't think they fixed this. Let me see it. Boarding call, Cleveland Ohio, 220. Columbus, Ohio, 220. There you go. How do you have all those degrees and not know how to operate a flip phone? How is it that I'm in a band with the only two dudes in America that don't have cellphones? I communicate on a higher plane. All good, buddy? Yeah. Ticket to ride. There is no way she's gonna to leave for London when she hears this tune. Thanks. Hey, give your uncle my thanks too, huh. Uh, listen, guys. If for some reason things don't-- Hey, hey. Don't even, OK? Feel the wind? It's at our backs, OK? And the gods? Well, they're riding shotgun, baby. I mean, how else do you explain how we got this far? Good luck, buddy. It's a hell of a song. Thanks, man. Hey, look. I wrote down a number where you can reach me. I'll be checking it, huh? And you guys be good to Bonnie Blue, she'll be good to you. OK. This is a final boarding call. Cleveland, Ohio, 220. Columbus, Ohio, 220. RGB. RGB. RGB. Check me out now. RGB. Come on, now. RGB. Check me out now. RGB. Oh, California, here we come. Oh, California here we come. We got a couple of guitars, old Bonnie on the run. Gonna open for the Melons, going to get me some. I thought you hated the Melons? Yes, I do. They're all posers, but they're gonna be our closers. We're playing before them. I don't think we're opening for them. What's the difference? Have you heard from him? Who? Granny? I don't know. Is it noon yet? Dude, it's dead. Hi. Mr. Granny, please? Hey, Granny. It's Brian from RGB. Sorry. Rich's phone died. Of course, we're halfway there. Yeah, what's up? Really? A full backing band? I mean, without a ton of time to rehearse, should we focus on that the harmonies and the songs? Actually, Greg isn't here. He's flying in, but we're all going to meet at the club. Really? I mean-- I mean, I guess I understand, but I-- Yeah. Uh, just call Rich's cell. What? What's wrong? What'd he say? He wants us to play with a whole backing band? Yeah. That doesn't make a lot of sense if we're not going to have time to rehearse. And he wants us to dump Greg. What? He wants us to dump Greg. What are you talking about? Granny said that he's holding us back. And if it was just "R&B", he'd feel a lot better about working with us. He said no one's doing three-part harmony. That's what makes us special? Yeah. Yeah. I know. Where we going, dude? So he said the showcase is off, if we don't, what-- fire Greg? Well, I don't know. He had to jump off. But as far as you know, he said that. Yeah. Who the hell-- now the thing works. Will you answer this? Answer before the-- Dude, what if it's Greg? Rich? Hey, man. Rich? Rich? What the fuck? Rich? Come on, man. Where are you going?! Dude? Rich? Hey, man? You OK? Fuck! Fuckity-fuck. Fucking shit! Fucking balls! Fuck! Fuck! I was a month away from graduating. You know, man, maybe they'll let you finish next semester. No. I mic dropped my dissertation at his feet. He's not inviting me back. Yeah. A sign, huh? What? That we were all supposed to find each other? That Granny was supposed to find us? You seem to have a hot line to the-- whatever it is up there. Out here, the signal must be four or five bars. What's he trying to tell us now? Dude, we shouldn't be out here. True that, my friend. True that. What's the definition of insanity? How can someone study their whole lives and still have no fucking clue? Dude, you're scaring me. I'm scaring you? Oh, that's rich. Yeah. Look around. We're in the middle of a fucking field. You're swearing like a fucking sailor. I never even heard you swear before. That's because I fucking hate swearing. It's dead fucking weight, dragging you down. When the right word, the right combination of words-- I don't know. Maybe you can-- fly. But you know what? Swearing feels good. If feels really fucking ass good. Fuck! Fuck you. Fuck you! All right. Come on. Let's get out. Fuck you! No, fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! They're just kids, but they're probably packing. Come on. Fuck you! Fuck you! What do I say again? Dude, the phone's gonna die. Just tell him the truth. The person you're trying to reach is not available. Please leave a message after the tone. Greg, it's Rich and Brian. Hey, uh, look. Something's changed, uh, about the California-- about the showcase. Um, Granny called and said-- it's canceled. Uh, I know. Fucking sucks. But at least now you don't have to race to catch that plane. And you can stay there for now. We're going through a tunnel. Uh, sorry. I hope everything's going well with Kelly. Brian says Hi too. There's a fire on the London Bridge. Smoke black like the night rose higher. And there's a hole in up through which, red flames like cathedral spires. Red flames like cathedral spires. Now the crossbeam's split in two. Bails of water to buy some time... Brian, is that you? Good morning, Sleeping Beauty. You gotta come see this. Hey, Sleeping Beauty, you gotta come see this. Hey. You OK? It's crazy, isn't it? The haze-- pollution right? Fucking beautiful. Rich, do you think writing and singing songs matters? My mom doesn't. My dad definitely didn't. He wanted me to be a doctor. The irony is he was a writer. Mine too. I thought he was in the military. He was until I was 12. Then he became a cop. But I mean, he hated me being a musician. I was on my way to his memorial when you guys picked me up in the van. I didn't make it, obviously. He would've preferred it that way anyway. We shouldn't do this. It doesn't feel right. Well, what I was going to say is I was going to take off, I was going to split. Then I had this thought. How many people down there you think? LA? I don't know. Millions. Right. And there are thousands of dudes down there that play guitar better than me. They write better songs. They sing better than I do. Everything that I can do, they do better. I also know that if I sit up here thinking about that. Or what my dad would want me to do. Or you know what-- maybe I'm too old for this shit, or any shit other than the one thing I give a shit about. Then I'll just wither away having never accomplished anything I can be proud of. Which is why, at exactly 1800 hours tonight, we will unsheathe our instruments of righteousness and we will engage the unholy hellions that hold this city in their thrall. And we will blaze a trail to glory, or be eviscerated in the fetid digestive slime of the-- eviscerated? Macerated maybe? Mas-- macerated? Hey, guys? Guys, you gotta see this. Hey, guys. Hey, guys, you gotta see this. Guys. Hey, guys. You gotta see this. You gotta see this. Whoa. Welcome to LA brother. Look at it, man. Yeah, we're good. Thank you. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Thank you. Yes. OK. Yeah. OK. You're welcome, man! Wow. How long was I out? Not too long. I figured you needed your beauty rest. But now that you're up, we should probably rehearse. It's three hours to showtime, brother! And as the sun dips to the sea. L.A. baby! Woo! I think of those who could not be with me. But I got miles of blue sky above me. And a blanket of sunshine to cover me. No one can take this away. I thank my lucky stars every day. Every day. Every day-- Does that sound weird without the third part? No, I don't think so. Whoa. Did you see that? That was Dr. Phil! My mom loves Dr. Phil. I found what I'm looking for, oh, oh. Maybe there's another "Bob's Crepery"? This is the address. Hey, Rich? Rich? Who rang that fucking bell!? Ah! I'm coming! I'm coming! Uh-- life must be tough for you guys. I'm sorry? You can't read? Oh, sorry. I didn't see that. The bell actually works? Unfortunately, yes. It does. And the kids in this fucking neighborhood apparently got nothing better to do than play "ding dong ditch" Now, I got two guys waiting on the phone. How can I help you? Oh, sorry. We're actually playing here tonight. We're supposed to find the manager. Sorry, we're late. Oh, no-- You're a bit early. Club doesn't open til 5:00. --Hey, man. Yeah, I'm coming! Well, what time's sound check? You'll get a line check, no sound check. --Hey, man. The phone! Yes, I'm coming! Jesus Christ! sorry-- what band are you guys? We're RGB. Oh. Well, why didn't you say so? That-- that is a whore of an entirely different color. Yeah. Well, you know... It's funny. I was-- I don't know. You guys, I was expecting, um-- well, you're a bit older, you know? But I loved the demo. Three-part harmony, I mean-- who does that anymore? Thanks. Thanks. Actually, we're R&B now. We should probably change that. You lost a G, huh? That blows. What happened there? Edwardo? Oh, for the fuck's sake! Load in is 15 minutes before your set, OK? I gotta go. Do you have any recommendations on where we could find some-- food? Guys, don't worry. Two-part harmony, three-part, what's the difference? It's harmony. Yeah, but-- Listen, you guys felt that you were stronger as a duo-- We felt we were stronger?-- And you made the tough call. But you know what? You made the right call. I gotta tell you something. The streets of this town are paved with the corpses of should-have-beens who just couldn't stomach the tough calls. But you two? You're the stars of this band, OK? And R&B-- I mean, come on, what a great name for a folk duo. Huh? Am I right? Rich? What about the backing band? We were hoping to sound check or run the tunes at least-- Hey, boys. The worrying is my job. You guys do like Jackson Browne-- "Take it easy" My boys will be there with 5:45, locked and loaded. You guys do what you do so well. I'll schmooze the record cats, OK? Then we'll all meet backstage and we'll raise a glass, all right? Rich? Rich? Come on-- Yeah. That's fine-- Is your phone acting up? I can't hear you. Right on! We said OK. Great! Great! Like Hamlet said-- veni, vidi, vici! Now, go get em, guys! --Hold that call. Stop. Hold that call! Let's do this. OK. You see Granny out there? It's too crowded. --Heads up. There is a dressing room, but we only get it for 45 minutes after the set. That's gotta be where he's gonna meet us. Where's our band?! --Last song. Start moving your stuff toward the stage. Shit! --Coming through. Listen. You try calling Granny, I'll get the stuff to the stage. Hey, Bri! Oh, guys. I'm so sorry. My plane was way delayed. Greg. You're here? Rich, it's Greg. Shit. You're probably trying to reach me. I knew when I couldn't reach you and I didn't hear from you that your phone was probably still messed up-- Wait-- you didn't hear from us? No. --Never? --Nothing? But I'm here. I'm in time? Yeah. Come on then! Yeah. I'm so relieved. Luckily, I reached Granny. He told me the address. He did?! Guys, they're done. I need you on stage setting up now! Where are my keys? --The van's right out back. I'll take you there. Be right there! Where's the drummer? We don't need him. Hey, G, how did it go? I'm sorry, man. Well, I'm just really glad to be with you guys at this point. Me too. Me too, buddy. Let's do this. All right. This is it. So much for Granny's band. --What band? You know what? Forget the band. This is RGB. --Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late. I'm Tommy, the drummer. Studio session ran late. --No sweat. But I think at this point, it's too late for any-- Don't worry about us. We'll be set in about 60 seconds. OK. Wow. --I mean, do they even know the tunes? Totally good to go, guys. Just do your thing. Love the tunes, guys. --Yeah. --Really great. Thanks. Thank you. Looks like it's all coming together. All right then. OK, put your hands together for RGB. OK, the first song we're going to play is-- --Already copied your set list. Ah, Great. The drums come in at-- Bar 9, tempo 65 bpm. Guys, just do your thing. We got your back. Literally. Ah... OK. This old house is cracked and worn. The walls are faded and the curtains torn. Sometimes it feels like we're running just to keep falling behind. The day is done. Won't you come? Leave the dishes, turn the TV off. I built a fire. Oh, and the fire is warm... Don't know where but I hear the beat of a drum. Somewhere I swear I hear the strains of a song. Dance with me to this song. Dance now darling, let your hair run down. Dance with me all night long. Thank you. Well, anyway. We are RGB. And thanks, thanks for coming. And this next tune we want to play, is a song called "Crumble". It's late. So tired. You called. And stumbled inside... Let's hear it for the Melons! Je suis rock and roll! --Yeah. That was fucking awesome, bro. --Hell, yeah. I think those chicks in the front row were digging it. --Your solo tonight in Revolution was --Nice set, guys. --Awesome --Good job! Nuke, You killed 'em! --How'd you like that? --Hey, I want you to meet the club manager. Steve? Steve? --Guys, great show. This is Nuke-- and Lefty. How you doing, Steve? --I've got to get you back, do another show, all right? Oh, thanks a lot. We'd love to. --Yeah. Thanks a lot, Steve. Look. A lot of people from the label want to meet you guys. So, you ready? --Yeah. Let's do this! --Am I ever? Come on, let's go! All right. Let's go. Just gotta get my guitar case. --Oh, hey man. I just need my case? All right... I guess Granny's not coming back... We're supposed to be out of here by now. We're supposed to be out of here by now, Rich. ...I can get you guys in front of some cats that could take this shit to Neptune. Honestly, I love what you're doing! --Yeah. Yeah, that's terrific. You guys are beautiful! Hey, Rich...? --Rich, you left your bag? Rich, where you going? Where's he going? Come on. I'll get his bag. I've been coming from far away... miles from anywhere, another day. That I rest my mind singing songs with the old ones. So hold me up. Come on, hold me up. Can't you hear me calling? The way the clouds move. Here they come, they're big and black. And that's the sound of a man who's working on his way back... I've been coming from far away. I'm miles from anywhere, another day. That I rest my mind singing songs with the old ones. Now, she comes to me. --Now she comes to me. She comes to me. Yeah, she comes to me at last. Now, she comes to me. --Now she comes to me. Yeah, she comes to me. She comes to me at last... I was waiting, I was waiting-- like an empty glass. --Like an empty glass. --Whoa. --Whoa. I was waiting, I was waiting like an empty glass. --I was waiting...
