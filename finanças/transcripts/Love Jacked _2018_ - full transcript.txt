This guy is uh, this guy is African, right? - Yeah, do you have a problem with that? - N-no, I'm just trying to get the big picture. - I thought you wanted me to settle down, and get married. - What's really happening here? This guy, he needs a green card, or something? - Okay, for your information, he is very wealthy, and he certainly does not need any green card! - You're not getting married, and that's all I have to say. - Well, it's my decision to make, and we're getting married, like it or not! - I want you to get on the next plane, and come home, and I don't want to hear any more about it! - I will come home when I'm good and ready! Clara: Maya, listen, your father means well. It's just that he's surprised by this news, that's all, and-- - And-and another thing is, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna do what I say, when I say it and that's-- - Oh!

(Malcolm sighs) - What are you doing? - What? - You have my dad ordering solar panels that he thinks you're gonna install when we come back from our honeymoon. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've done 'em before. - You're not coming back from our honeymoon, remember? - Oh yeah, I knew that. Right. Uh... I was just trying to be convincing. I mean, isn't that the whole idea? - I never asked for my dad to like you. I actually preferred it when he didn't. - Well, I'm just trying to be myself. - You're not supposed to be yourself, you're supposed to be Mtumbie! (Groans) - Where you going? - I just need to be by myself for a little.

Well, I haven't painted in a while. - And why is that? - I've just got some stuff I need to figure out. - What kind of stuff? - I don't know. But when I get out of South Bay, I'll figure it out. - Why? What's wrong with South Bay? Why can't you just paint here? It's beautiful. - I'm not inspired here. I just hit a wall. - But this is where you're from. Where your pops, aunt, G-mamma... I mean, look at this. Doesn't this account for something? - Maybe it's just me. That's why I went off to Africa, to experience something different. - Yeah, you sure did that, for sure. (Both laugh) Where do you keep your paint supplies? - In the sunroom at the back of the house. Why? - Just asking. Ahh... (Birds chirp) ♪♪♪ (Seagulls cry) - What are you doing? - Painting.

Tut! I will show you when I am done. - So are you still planning on going to San Francisco when we're... done? - I don't know. I might just go back east. Oof! - How do you live like that? Not having any direction. - Ah, you just get used to it. - Where's your family? - I don't have none. - You must have some family. - Nope. I'm an orphan. - I am so sorry, I had no idea. I totally made that up when I said that to my family, I just didn't want them asking questions. - Okay, hey, relax. How could you have known? - So how long have you been an orphan? That's a stupid question. - Since I was four. Yeah, my folks died in a car crash. Yeah, I had no close relatives that wanted to take me in, and so I was put up for adoption. But honestly, I think I was kind of homely as a kid, which didn't help. (Both laugh) I mean, you go into this place, you got all these strangers, and you're all like, can you pick me?

No, no, no, it was a mistake. - Mhmm. - Okay, it was hot, and I am sorry. - I know, it was hot, but the heat wasn't coming from the sun, if you know what I mean? - No, no, no, no, no. Maya and me, we have... bumboya. - Bumboya? - Yes, bumboya. It is when the Gods put love in the hearts of the man, and the woman, and if anyone gets in between their Bumboya, they will be cursed forever! (Snaps fingers) - Whoa! Okay. - Yes. - Okay well, you can't knock a girl for trying. I didn't know you guys had bumboya. No hard feelings? I guess I'll see you at the wedding. - Yes. Okay. Bumboya!

What? - I warned you not to make a pass at her! - What are you talking about? - I just saw you behind the boathouse. - You just saw me behind... (Gasps) Oh! Mm-mm!

You know, you are one twisted individual! I couldn't care less if you're interested in Naomi. I'm sure she's your type. After this honeymoon is over, you're out of my life for good, thank God, and you can go and find some other Naomi in some other town. I'm sure they're easy to find.
