I remember that military memorial in Kiev in which I walked as a child. I admired this Motherland statue which represents a warrior protecting Ukraine. Today I realize the absurdity of this symbol in such a patriarchal country. In 2013, most Ukrainians wanted the country to join the European Union. But Viktor Yanukovytch, pro-Russian president at the time, refused the negotiations. Immediately the people rise up. The president flees to Russia. It's known as the MaiÌˆdan revolution. Hundreds of civilians died. The country is split between pro-Europeans versus pro-Russians. A separatist insurrection supported by the Russian army is developing in Ukraine's eastern border. Look at me! Do you recognize me? You see this? Eat it up! Scumbag! Eat it up, bastard! Eat it up! Why are you shaking? In 2014, the first Minsk protocol is signed to stop this escalation. A ceasefire is planned but will never be respected. Since the beginning of the conflict, more than 13,000 people have been killed. For the past three years, the media have been broadcasting a distorted image of women engaged in the front line. They are shown as fragile in this macho world. I decided to join the front line to meet three of these women. And show that they are up to the task of the other soldiers. I expected to film the daily lives of these women at war. But they gave me much more by entrusting me with their inner war. Here's Lera, the commander of the mortar firing unit. She was a journalist. I came to the front to report. As the commander was coming back from the mission, he sadly said: "No more men are joining the war anymore." I thought I should quit my job to join the army. And that's what I did. The young lady lives in this shelter. She doesn't complain. But she misses her daily comfort. I wish I could shower every day, instead of once a week. That's what I miss the most. I wanted to go to the front, but the commander wanted me in the press office. I used to hide every time he came to get me, so he finally gave up. It's complicated for women to get to the front line. You have to hustle to be promoted to the front, instead of being confined here. Moryachok was a deminer. He taught me how to handle mines. He wanted me to be his assistant, but he quickly realized that I sucked. One day I made a mistake that almost killed us, and then he stopped training me. Then he refused to send me on a mission in the minefields. He wanted to protect me, so he preferred to send another soldier. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes. Do you know what kind of mine killed him? Yes, a mine 50, the one that exploded first. Moryachok was an incredible person, I wouldn't be able to explain it. Do you miss him? The best thing that could happen would be that he comes back to life. I had just arrived when they started moving his body. His corpse was lying next to a wounded soldier in the truck. On the way back, I spotted a gun in the truck. I wanted to kill myself. They pulled the gun off my hands to prevent me from dishonoring myself. Fire! Wasp to Owl! Got it! Not the right moment. Fire! I found pictures of you on Instagram. What's their story? It was us in 2015. I wouldn't have minded having a baby with his eyes. I never wanted to have children, but he did. Until the last moment I thought I was pregnant by him. Actually I was only late on my period by three days. No big deal. I imagined that having his child would have filled his absence. But actually not at all. I really think he can hear me and I can talk to him. I don't know how to explain. I feel like he is everywhere. Stop crying! Why are you so sad? Stop, enough! Lena! Take the grenade launcher in your hand. Here. No, don't put it on your shoulder yet. Give me your hand and take it. Put it inside. Make sure it's in the right spot. All good? Take the gun and put it on your shoulder. Are you holding it tight? Get in position. You scream: "fire!" Fire! Stephan, will you take a profile picture for me, please? Of course! I joined the war in 2014, as a volunteer. At that time, the entire country was trying to support the army. What is your position in the war? I am the commander of the mortar unit. Are you officially working? Of course! Officially since 2016. How did this happen? An ordinary story, a love story. I met a man, I fell in love and followed him. In 2016 we realized that we couldn't live without each other. Elena used to run a chain of stores, and then she became a volunteer. Recently she's signed a contract with the army. She is temporarily the commander of the unit. Despite this "unfeminine" work, she still has a manicure. My nails are already broken. Even under such conditions I try not to forget that I'm a woman, that men are watching me. The nickname Witch is on Elena's chevron. The car is a gift from the volunteers. I know how to change the oil, and replace the wheel. But no more than that, I'm not a multifunctional soldier. Elena often says she misses home where her daughter and son are but she must remain in the front line. You are our guest. Come and join us. No, thank you. You are sweating. We were waiting for you. Stay for a minute. Turn it off. He is the colonel's brother. How does a woman feel in war, constantly amongst men? Normal. If you introduce yourself well you'll feel good. I would even say that it's better than with women. There is more understanding, it's quieter. I have to go. Johnny is changing the oil in my car. Have you ever felt any discrimination? Never. Sometimes it's useful... to be blonde. You can avoid a lot of problems like that. There are some who say that... a woman's place is at home, in the kitchen with the kids. In war you are your own master. Our true faces are revealed here. WITCH In 2014, I came to the front line. And I had to be evacuated in 2015. I had an accident there. Before I was healthy, with two eyes and two legs. Now I'm amputated. Men were horrible. They're just laughing at you, like you're just a pussy. I tried to change the way men look at me. I tried to be equal to them. I did a man's job. There is no woman's labour in war. Of course there is discrimination. In the army, in my current job... At the front it's gender discrimination, at work it's because of my health. When I came back from the war in a wheelchair it was because of my disability. Discrimination exists. My colleague, a beautiful woman, told me: "Who's going to take care of you? "You're disabled now. "You will not be able to do a good job or meet our expectations." You don't regret anything? No, I don't think so. It's all right, I'm working. If I work, it's all good. Ira has regained her consciousness after a week in a coma. She first saw the infusion bag, the hospital walls. She remembers exactly what happened. As I was leaving my unit, I understood that I had stepped on a mine. According to the information we got, there were not supposed to be any mines... Irina Ivanysh is better known with her nickname "Buttercup". She first went to the East of Ukraine as a volunteer. Four months later she joined the army. She was a doctor in the army. She has always been on the front line. But on May 26, 2015 near Avdiivka, during a mission with her team, she stepped on a mine. She lost both her legs and injured her hand. No one can destroy you? No. This is her first time out after three weeks in intensive care. She has already overcome the worst. I want to walk, run and work. Are you ready? Great. Can I take a picture of your profile? - Do you want to film this mess? - I'm not filming it! Masha, I don't have time for this! I have to finish my job, if I don't want to be fired! Have a minimum of respect! Okay, okay, okay! That's all right. Can you just read me one... of your poems? Please. Wait, I'll pick one. Great, thank you. "Evil world, you will not imprison me. "No point in setting traps, I'll avoid your abyss. "Why seven out of ten keep silent? "When the truth resonates in their ears. "And one brother puts the other in jail. "Evil world, ravaged by torture, keeping me from moving forward. "Why do you make me so drunk, dear life? I sing in your honor." Why are you keeping that jacket on? This is a new one. The one I had at the front was destroyed during the explosion. That's it... Is there something that scares you? Waking up one morning and realizing that everything we've done has been meaningless. No more state, no more national language. - I would like to share with you... - I don't trust you. Behind all these questions, you're thinking about creating some buzz. It pisses me off. I know very well that you are an actress, you know how to play. I'm so sick of these bitches, I would have killed them all! Well, I think I'll go... Yeah. I don't think I'm afraid of anything anymore. Everyone dies, it's inevitable. You know, my mother passed away. My father died this year in March, my mother before the New Year. And my brother in May. It's tough. Without all this misfortune, I would have been the happiest person. Why don't you have a bulletproof vest? Look in the viewfinder! I've already looked! We didn't have that at the other position. - Why did you move from the position? - They wanted to separate us. I was on my way home. And there you go again... Aim at 100m from the center. Fire! You even get used to death. And that's really scary, Masha. You really get used to death. - Where is it falling? - Right here! Don't stand by the window! Damn, there are guys out there! Commander for Witch! Odessa, this is Mer. Do you copy? Mer to Odessa. Roger that. Witch to Odessa. - Are these the same bombs as... - Yes, the same as before. The artillery is bombing our village. If the situation does not change, we're gonna have to hide down there. Odessa, this is Left. We're changing position. - Are you religious? - No. I like to believe in... Valhalla. What is the "Valhalla"? A paradise for warriors! Good morning, ladies. Our loved one. You are the one who gave strength to our army. I wish you lots of love and happiness. Happy Woman's Day! It makes no sense for me to come back here to Polygon. I really want to be on the front line. It's supposed to be a holiday for the soldiers. But it's not at all relaxing, it's worse than being in combat. Officially, they say there will be training. But I am sure that nothing will happen because I have already experienced this. They only send us there to fill their quotas. I don't need to be taught how to use a Kalashnikov, I've been doing it for three years. And you can hear them when they run away. They left on all fours! Once, they gave us a "Summer Pass". Don't film us while we're getting drunk. Masha stop filming me! You can't see anything. Tundra, Tundra, this is Odessa. Corruption is everywhere in the army. The Ministry of Defence is supposed to provide us with equipment but some of it is sold on the black market. The government doesn't give a shit about us. We're left behind. Of course, they buy equipment, but nothing ever gets to us! - What are you thinking about? - How to get the hell out of here. The soldiers filmed their conditions at Polygon. This is the shower. It's a 200-liter bar for 350 people. This is the toilet. That's why our colleague refused to use it. Lera Burlakova, the commander of the mortar firing unit. She's been in the Polygon for a few months. She says there is no training at all. At the front we could decide how to get organized. In Polygon we have no rights, not even to talk to reporters. Hearing the shots... It was obvious that we were a target. If they had moved more than a hundred meters forward, they could have killed us. Everything was destroyed by the shells. - You also did a good job! - Us? - You destroyed their shelter. - When, yesterday? - You also destroyed their network. - That's good! That's not the one I asked for. Look, I am driving and I'm with my kid. Don't bother me. Ilyusha always asks me a lot of questions. If I shoot, if I'm afraid... That sounds a lot like your questions. but with the innocence of a child. What scares you the most about war? The loss of loved ones. It's very scary. I just wish I could live in peace. How do you imagine life after the war? If it ends... With sunglasses! Life is going to be so bright that I can only imagine that? After weeks of trying, I finally reached Lera. Can I come back to see you? I received permission to film you at the Polygon. Of course, but now I'm on the front. Believe me, it's much better than in Polygon. You were transferred? Everything happened very fast. We took our stuff and ran away. But isn't that against the law? Yeah. Don't worry. - Are you still in the army? - Yes, but I'm wanted. And I don't give a fuck. Relax and come here. I woke up a hundred meters from the car. We were close to death. Are you ready? Done. Does it hurt? Good. One soldier told me that Lera had been arrested for desertion. She faces up to ten years in prison. We ask you to consider the document presented justifying her qualities. She is a patriot and she wants to continue to serve her country. We negotiated an agreement with the prosecutor on the amount of the fine. We ask you to confirm it. The agreement was concluded voluntarily and it meets the requirements of the society. I ask the court to approve this agreement which acknowledges Valeriya's conviction. The defendant, please stand up. Burlakova Valeriya Igorivna, you are guilty of a criminal offense under article 407, paragraph 4. In the Criminal Code of Ukraine, this offense is punishable by a fine equivalent to five non-taxable incomes, a total of 8500 UAH. - Why are you in court? - The answer is easy. I had no training at the Polygon. I asked to be transferred 3 times. No one would sign my application, they left me no choice. It was either suicide or desertion. In the Polygon everyone is drunk. Yes, I left to join the front. I knew it was a crime, but I came to fight. And not to accept the army's shit. I'm not against following orders. I didn't try to escape from my military duties. But they did it by sabotaging the training at the Polygone. I'm just doing my job to protect my country. Damn it, Lera, I'm so proud of you. I always knew you had balls. You're not like other people. You're really kicking their asses! So what? Has anything changed? So, yes. I will stay one night. Come on, let's go home, I'm starving! Oh, shit... - Here, I'll help you. - It's okay, it's already ready. There you go. Next! He called me and told me: "Mom, "I found the love of my life. "Her name is Lera and we'll be coming soon." I reminded him that he had already burned his wings once. He said to me: "Mom, it's true love. "But does it matter that she's older than me?" I told him it was his own life. He told me they would arrive on January 20th. The whole neighborhood knew they were coming to get married! There you go... Forgive me, mom, for fighting this morning, Forgive me. From now on, you'll be on your own I love you but I love Ukraine too! Mom, you're the only ones who matter I love you but I love Ukraine too You and Ukraine... Will always be the only ones for me! Moryachok told me not to cry. Don't cry then. The day of the funeral, when the coffin was put in the ground I threw a handful of soil as tradition has it. I was fucking devastated. There were more than a hundred people present. Suddenly, I made my way through the crowd to go and isolate myself in a field. I remember that picture of me sitting in the field. I had finally managed to be alone. For almost half an hour, I spoke to him crying. The first few months, it seemed normal to me to speak aloud with Moryachok. I communicate with him now. I'm waiting for the moment you tell me you're pregnant. My commander won't understand. - Seriously, for your own life... - They're gonna kick me out! - I'd be fired! - You will be! I'll treat your baby like mine. We'll talk about it when the war is over. You are not a young girl. First we have to win. No. Lera, you'll be too old! That's all right. I'll be wiser. So what? That's bullshit. Find yourself a good boy. Life must go on. Your mother will be happy. Come on, let's take a selfie! Wait, my camera is dirty. I feel confused. I've gotten used to people who only talk to me when they need something. And you just came to me. It means a lot to me, it makes me happy. It always surprises me that... a person is still capable of behaving in a humane manner in this highly artificial world. Yeah... - Is it okay, not too tight? - No, I'm fine! Back up a little bit, please. - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to our heroes! The new school year ceremony is officially open! Let's start the patriot game. Let's welcome our jury, our dear guests! An excellent teacher, a war hero, and an exceptional woman, Ira Ivanush! Love, peace and kindness for our country. Without this our country couldn't exist. I wish peace for Ukraine and our neighbors... We draw this heart because we love our country very much. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to our heroes! When you are alone and everything is dark When you don't believe anyone and you don't know nothing else And you've already lost your hope... Ira, can you come closer to the center? Boys, help her! Here you go! Very good! Now smile to our future! Everything will be ok! And you too, come in. Everyone has already left. Three seconds, please. - That's enough. - Think about your wedding. What do you feel? Are you worried? No, it's too late... to worry. Ilyusha, is this a joke? Mom is very stressed! Even my bag is playing tricks on me, it doesn't want to close. Sasha, answer the phone, Sacha, please! Is today your first day? Yes, as a married woman! My beloved husband, Sasha Podolianin. He teases me all the time like a real friend. With Sasha, we're in perfect harmony. That's our life. You know, equal attracts equal. Touch my hair. And something else? Come here, close to me. No, he must be on the other side. The exchange of rings has always been a ritual. That symbolize a perfect circle with no beginning nor ending. I now pronounce you husband and wife I wish you a happy family life! Remember this day for the rest of your life. Don't let everyday life get you down. Let's drink to this new family! Drink in your honor and immortalize it with a kiss! Natasha! The more we move forward in life, the more people we lose. I try to be strong and live with all these losses. But you're taking control of your life. And life goes on. If we only lived in the past, we would be unhappy. In the present, there are children, men. Everyday life, you know. We want to live. Masha, who could have told me... three or four years ago, that I would be a soldier with a rank. I'd have thought that that person is completely insane. What are you going to do after the war? I don't know. Live! Continue to live! After Moryachok's death, Lera made a tattoo on her hand. "See you in the Valhalla."
