(ALARM BUZZlNG) (GROANS) Yo, dawg. Konnichiwa. What? Konnichiwa. Konnichiwa means, "What's up?" -So what the fuck's up? -We know what it means. Hey, you want a smoke? You can read the paper through this, it's so clean. A couple of hits, you'll be fucking like beasts. -You boys like pussy, right? -Hey! Do we look like fucking tweakers to you? -So you got the shit or not? -Yeah. You? What the fuck is this? We said a machine gun. lt is a machine gun. The kind you can carry. Couldn't get none of those. This baby's got character. Korean War vintage. Maybe even mowed down one of your grandpapa-sans when he was charging the wire at lnch'on. This is bullshit. lt's fucking stuck. Fuck it, take the ride. Three large. VlN's clean. Nigga, l drive a $1 00,000 car! We want your faggoty-ass ride, we'll jack it from you. Cool. Don't decide right now. Konnichiwa is Japanese. lt's insulting to Koreans. How am l supposed to tell if you can't? What the fuck is that supposed to mean, white boy? lt means you got eyes like apostrophes, you dress white, talk black and drive Jew. So, how am l supposed to know what kind of zipperhead, dog-munching dink you are if you don't? Yo. Do you know who the fuck we are? Yeah. You're a couple of panheads buying a machine gun out of a trunk. (GRUNTlNG) Wassup, you son of a bitch? -Pick him up. -Get your ass up. l'm getting the shit out of here. Give me the keys! -Konnichiwa, bitch. -Let's go! (GROANS) Where? (GRUNTS) (EXHALES) lt's okay. l'm a cop. (SNlFFLlNG) (SOBBlNG) (WOMAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) Captain Wander, congratulations on breaking the case. Can you tell me how you found the twins? Julie, my people had turned the city upside down looking for these girls. l could not be prouder of my men. OFFlCER: Ma'am, excuse me. How can you shoot a guy taking a dump? l mean, seriously. That... That's sacred. That's like shooting a man in church. Or a Dodger game. Hey, whatever it takes to be a hero. Anytime, anyplace, right, Lud? lt gets old. l hate these short-eyed, kiddie-raping bastards. At least kidnap some full-grown ladies with shapes. Wow. Maybe you should check his closet next, huh, Lud? The girls are being examined by a physician right now. Both twins are in good health and will be reunited with their family shortly. SANTOS: LA Times front page tomorrow is gonna say, "Vice Detective Rescues Missing Twins." Detective. Singular. Yeah. Like we've been sitting around on our ass doing jack-shit in our unit the last month. Hey! You two cut the shit. The boss is on his way right now. l mean, you could have saved some for us. -l did you a solid, Santos. -You did me a solid? You want to see their faces every night? You want to be a killer? You know what? Shut the fuck up. Hey, hey, what the hell is going on? Hey! This is real professional. What if l walked in here with the Chief, huh? Santos, deploy your ass outside. Find Ted Berman and make sure that that crime scene log is in order. -Yes, sir. -Run along, boy. SANTOS: Shut the fuck up. WANDER: Hey, secure that bullshit, all right? Both of you. Clady, you take DeMille back to the barn and start writing. l want something to red-pin by midnight. Tell those body monkeys to get right in here. You got it, Cap. Let's go. (DOOR CLOSES) This is crazy! You fucked them up! This is beautiful. And that machine gun shit, that was perfect. l know you hated waiting, but it's better this way. -You all right? -Yeah. l... -l got shot. -Yeah, but you okay? Yeah, l'm okay, Jack. 'Cause l know you're not tripping about these... These assholes right here? Fuck them. Screw them. You went toe-to-toe with evil and you won. You saved those girls. This is lovely, Tommy. Come here. Come here, man. Give me... Give me a hug! Come on. (TOM GROANS) -Ribs are tender. -What you hiding from? -Nothing. -What you hiding from? You've been drinking. You know that... That thing they say about vodka? How you can't smell it? lt's bullshit. The D.A.'s shooting team is en route right now. And you're not ready for public consumption. So, come on. l want to get you to a hospital, get you away from all those guys. Come on. All right. Thanks, Jack. l think we can do some damage control. lf it ain't LA's deadliest white boy. Aren't you on the wrong side of the yellow tape? Congrats on four more notches for your gun belt. l'll be praying for the families of your victims. They're called suspects. The victims are the 14-year-old school girls the suspects kept in a cage and sold to chicken hawks to poke, prod and put on the Internet. Suspects, Washington. Suspects. As evil as those men were, they had a right to trial. There's gonna be some blowback from the Korean community on this one. Now that you're all militant, why don't you just say it? You think l'm a racist. -You have another explanation? -No, l don't. Because if l roll and determine the suspects are black, yellow or brown, l'll blow them out of their socks. But if they're white, l'll give them a ride home. You know why? 'Cause l'm a racist. Fuck you. Man, l would give my right arm to have that shit on tape. What happened to you, Terrence? We used to be brothers. Hey, hey, stay on point. Washington, you stay on point. Always, Captain Wander. Always. Tom. Come on, let's get you out of here. -Don't go near that piece of shit. -He's got it coming, Jack. Do not go near him. You stay away, far away. -Fuck him. -That's an order. l'm waiting for Nurse Garcia. l did the same thing with this girl once. She was a waitress at a jazz bar. And l'd sit in her section, wouldn't let anybody else serve me. She'd change sections, l'd change tables. Persistence. That's the key. Wait a second. You're that cop! You're... l just seen your face on TV. You rescued those twins in Koreatown, right? Are you okay? Did you get shot? No. Yeah. Who the hell are you? Me? l sell insurance, life, auto, casualty. Wow, that's some heavy shit, man. So those guys, they... They shot first, right? Excuse me? Whole city was looking for those kids. How'd you find them? That's my job. (MAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) WOMAN: Sergeant Green, Sergeant Green... Excuse me, Captain. Sorry to interrupt. Deputy Chief Sorensen is trying to raise you on a simplex. lnsurance, Tom. l sell insurance. lf you ever need any, and you will, why don't you give me a call? No one has to know but us. Not Clady, not Wander, no one. (SCOFFS) Listen, for your own good, don't get yourself so far out there that l can't reel you back. See you sometime. Who was that? A cop who burns cops. Jesus. -Who? -Nobody, Grace. -Hi. -Hi. Oh. Hold this. You know, you can just stop by sometime. You don't have to get shot when you want to see me. (GROANlNG) Why? l like it like this. Don't you? No, l don't. (TOM SlGHS) l don't. No. Don't get close to me. l work here. l'm not losing my license for you. -l'm a cop. -No. Whatever. TOM: l kicked the door after identitying myself as a police officer. Upon entry, l was fired upon by a suspect in the living room with a silver automatic. l returned fire, he goes down. Then l'm hit in the torso by shotgun fire from the second suspect. Point of entry? Front door on the west side of the structure. OFFlCER: Why didn't you call for backup? Exigent circumstances. l heard screams emanating from the house and ascertained a crime was in progress. (OFFlCERS CHATTERlNG) -...saying something. -Take care, Silk. -lt was great working with you. -Thanks a lot. Now it's a party. Oh, my goodness! Now it's a binge, Captain. -What's up, killer? -Steady. Steady. Yeah, he's in. What's with you? What, Clady give you a happy ending? ls that any way to address a commander? l got the call from the Chief this morning. Badge ceremony's next week. Congratulations, boss. Hey. We're gonna have the keys to the city. You believe that shit? They're crowning him king. Let's get a toast to that. A toast to the king! -King Wander! -King Wander! Yo, boss. Can l be your driver when you make chief? WANDER: You got it. You got it. Whatever you want. You know, l owe you one, Tom. That Park twins caper, that gave me the edge. You know, the Chief, he's breaking tradition by promoting me here. The first commander slot always goes to the head of lnternal Affeirs. That's the way it is. That's because they got so much dirt on everyone. That's right, and they're always looking for more, huh? Yeah. You know this prick? Came at me like Joe Concerned Citizen, asking procedural questions. Yeah, yeah, we got a history, this little... See, if you showed up during the daytime, you would know who your enemies are. What'd you tell him? l couldn't help myself, Clady. l told him everything. DeMlLLE: Attaboy! You know, this is a typical Biggs bullshit move. This is his M.O. He'll back-door you every fucking time. Why is lnternal Affeirs up my ass all of a sudden? lt's Washington, brother. Your ex-partner's been snitching. Holy shit. Jack, talk to me. Washington's had several meetings with Captain Biggs over the last few weeks. There are no secrets in the department. So, when l became cognizant of the problem, we threw a tail on him. l followed this guy Eastside, Westside, Southside. Next thing l know, he's ringing Biggs' doorbell in Upland. Who's Washington giving up? You, Tom. -Me. Why now? -Yeah. Because l shitcanned him from the unit and he's a vindictive bastard. Now he's on a mission to pull the rug out from under all my best guys. All my best guys. That's what this shit is about. CLADY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -CLADY: Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy! -Man! Tommy, hey, that's your life. -That's your life right there. -l'm just gonna talk... -No, you're not. You're not. -You want to talk? Let's talk about my foot up your ass if you don't sit the fuck down -in that goddamn chair. -He's all right. Have a seat. Come on. He's all right. WANDER: What the fuck is wrong with you? Do not, and l repeat, do not hand Washington your badge. l know you two have done some dirt together. But we gotta hold the line, you and me. We've been here before, haven't we? When the gates of hell opened up on you, Tom? And l took care of you then. l'm gonna take care of you now. All right? Okay. Okay. (HIP-HOP MUSIC BLARING ON CAR STEREO) Washington. Washington. -Drop it, Tom! Now! -What the hell are you doing? (PANTlNG) -You going to kill me, partner? -You're crazy! We got a 21 1 in progress! l got you, l got you and Wander. Listen to me, you idiot! We got two gangbangers rolling in hot! (GUN FlRlNG) Shit! (WASHlNGTON GASPlNG) Washington, stay with me, partner. (POLlCE SlREN WAlLlNG) (BRAKES SQUEALlNG) (WOMAN OHATTERING ON POLIOE RADIO) -Don't move! Let me see your hands! -l'm a cop. l'm a cop! l'm a fucking cop! Fuck. lt's Ludlow. Get me an ambulance. Now. Holy shit. He's a cop, too? Yeah. WANDER: Where's the video? -Who else has seen this shit? -Just us, boss. lt was a straight 21 1 that went sideways. lt's not what it was, Lud. lt's what it looks like. But it's not what it looks like. -lt's not. -That's all there is, Tom! What it looks like! What everybody sees! You knew that! Lud, anybody in the department sees this video, you're no longer a cop, do you understand that? The department? The D.A. sees this... He's... He's going to prison. Why? Because Washington was in the wrong place at the wrong time? No, because you were. Washington's problems are over, yours are just beginning. Try to think two moves ahead for once. Captain Biggs will say that you got two thugs off the street and went after a cop who was diming you out to lnternal Affeirs. lt writes itself. -l was just gonna break his jaw. -That's a good answer. l gave you a direct order, stay away from him. Give me your goddamn burner now. Give me your goddamn burner! We know you don't give a shit about yourself, Lud. That's pretty obvious. But you gotta think about the unit. -You really fucked us on this one. -Clady. -Give me a minute, please. -Yes, sir. l can't afford to lose you. Who'd do what you do? You are the tip of the fucking spear. Who's gonna hold back the animals? Maybe the clerk forgot to put the disk in the recorder today. Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom, and you rendered aid to Washington. l'll go outside. Make some calls. And maybe, this won't be here when l get back. TOM: He was my partner back in the day. We were black and white in a black and white when it was still a big deal. White cops wouldn't back us 'cause of him and the black cops 'cause of me. Fuck them. We made it. Sorry. You tried to save him. You did your best. My best? l was curled up in a ball while he got shot. We should have dumped those guys. How can they just wave a pen and change what happens just like that? We're the police. We can do whatever the hell we want. Doesn't matter what happens. lt's how we write it up. What about the truth? What about it? You have to honor him, your friend. "Honor him"? l was going to knock him out and he thought l was going to kill him. Prick. Don't turn your back on him. Good can come from bad. ln my world, the real world, the bad breeds more bad, Grace. See this? lt's done. lt's over. lt's taken care of. All right? l won't give you another dose here, but got a set of blues in your locker? -No. -Here's the thing. -l gotta bury you. -Not that. ln a nice, politically correct spot until this Washington thing settles down a little bit. No, Jack. SUPERVlSOR: Your job is to conduct preliminary interviews of the complainant. lf there's a specific allegation against an officer, write it up, forward it to lnternal Affeirs. Now, the temptation is to be a good brother cop. Don't be. None of this shit's going anywhere anyway. There's your desk. Suppose l get a complaint against myself? (CHUCKLES) Write it up and forward it. Okay? -Okay. -Okay. You have a complaint? Motherfucker beat my ass like l was Rodney King, man. Except there wasn't no video. Dude looked just like you. But black. This ass been working longer than all y'all cops disrespecting me. He pulled me out of my ride, homes, disrespected me in front of my old lady. Tried to get her number and shit. You get his badge number or see his nametag? Not with his boot on my throat and his partner kicking me. No, it was a little bit difficult. Everybody comes here, they have a complaint. They sit down. l done waited for my fucking five hours and you gonna ask me, do l have a complaint? Obviously, l have a complaint. You know what? This is some bullshit. That's why l hate all these motherfucking cops. Fuck all y'all! Wander has got a sense of humor, l'll give him that. You have a complaint? Where to begin? The black band. Man down. Hurts, right? Losing a colleague. Brother in blue. l'm sorry he's gone, sir. You two worked Vice Special together. Pushed a black and white in Southend. Phonebook Tom, the last of the ghetto gunfighters. l heard you got your best confession with a '91 directory. You know Washington was holding the asshole down. ls this an interview? Just a little back and forth. Well, Captain, l'm not much of a dancer, so if there's something you'd like to ask... Want to go and get some lunch, Tom? This is the interview. Regarding yesterday's incident, you were the first on scene, correct? Yes, sir. -Three shooters, right? -Two. Read the report. What would you say if l told you the pathologist recovered three different calibers from Terrence Washington's body? Sounds like three shooters to me. What were you doing there, Tom? Come on, man to man. Tape's off. Damn it! lt doesn't bother you that there are two cop killers out there? Living, laughing, fucking? lt doesn't bother you, Tom? Yes, it bothers me! So, why'd you let them get away, gunfighter? Hey, let's get something straight, Captain, nobody's getting away. What happened to the video from the store? What video? Listen to me. Every time you shit the bed, Wander's there to change the sheets. Well, not anymore, son. l'm going to pour gas on you, l'm going to pour gas on Wander and everyone in Vice Special. Then l'm lighting the match and l'm gonna burn all of you. l tried to save you, Detective Ludlow. Your window's closed. And that third shooter? He's mine, so help me God. WANDER: Get back in your office! -WOMAN: Captain, you there? -l'll call you back. What the fuck are you doing in my office? What the fuck are you doing jamming my people at lunch? lf you got a problem with Ludlow, you come to me. You keep your dog on a leash. Everybody knows he can't make a move without you. You go cry to Daddy? Stop right there. Stop. Tom is a damn fine cop. He bleeds blue. You got an open case on him? Vice Special? You got one on me? You formally investigating us? This is a fishing expedition. Because you know if you went to the Chief and you asked him to open a case on me or anybody in my unit, he would laugh you out of his office. Listen to me, you piece of shit. l have watched you intimidate, bully and blackmail your way up through the pay grades for 20 plus years. l know exactly what you are. You've got no business being a commander. You like Tom, don't you? l saw the way you watched him when he came in. That's why you follow him around, you want him to give you a blow job. Like that hooker l caught you with when we were sergeants. -You remember? -Shut up, Jack. Does your wife know that you use prostitutes, Jimmy? lt was the best head l ever had. And what about you, Jack? You always found it hard to keep your prick out of the ghetto. lt's a two-way street, buddy. You can't ride the tiger forever. Now get the hell out of my office. Do the department a favor, and wash your mouth out with buckshot. Come on, Tom. Let's get out of here. From his time on the street to his time in your schools and homes, Detective Washington was tireless in his devotion to his church, his love for his family, and his dedication to this department. Uniform Detail. Atten-hut! OFFlCER: Honor Guard, port arms! Half right face! Ready, aim, fire! Aim, fire! Uniform Detail, present arms! (TRUMPET PLAYlNG TAPS) MAN: He was a good guy. We'll miss him. We'll go back to work now. Back to work. -Listen, that was a nice speech. Thank you. -Let's go get them. Thank you, sir. Mrs. Washington. l was first on scene. Yeah, of course you were. Excuse me. You Diskant? Yeah. You're working Washington? Yeah. You know who l am? Yes. You planning on interviewing me? (CLEARS THROAT) You're on my list. Well, let's get rolling. Where do l start? Gang books? Mug shots? 21 1 reports? lf you want. Come on, Diskant, you've worked a homicide before. l'm two for two. (SlGHS) Okay, two for two, you got a ballistics report? No. The bullets are still at the coroner's. Yeah, but they're giving you updates, right? They tell you how many different calibers they dug out of Washington? -What do you want? -How many? Goodbye, Detective. (DlSKANT DlALlNG) -Harry! -Hey. l thought you were dead. l'm from Vice Special. CORONER: Tom Ludlow. l know who you are. l handled your wife's autopsy. -That was you? -Mmm-hmm. The asshole. Remember? Right. The guy who washed away all the hair and fiber evidence. The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab. The guy who left me nothing to go on. lt's not my job to investigate adultery. How can l help you? -Pulled these out of Washington? -Yup. Eighteen rounds. Ten .45-caliber full metal jackets. Seven 9-mil FMJs. And a single .38 hollow-point mushroomed against his scapula. Serious overkill. He must have really pissed off the shooters. DlSKANT: Get what you're looking for? Hi, l'm Detective Diskant. We spoke on the phone earlier. -l'm here for the ballistics evidence. -How you doing? DlSKANT: Thank you. When can l expect your report? CORONER: Give me about an hour or so. The lab's backlogged today. -Thanks. Can you fax it to my office? -Sure can. Thank you, Doc. Diskant, talk to me. You got three different calibers, that means three weapons. What's your take on what went down in that market? Two bad guys come in the front door to rob the place. One of them sees the clerk, cuts him in half. The other one sees Washington, whose weapon is already drawn, empties his clip into him. His buddy joins the party till he runs dry. And one of them pulls a two-incher, pumps a final "fuck you" round into Washington's back. They leave, you show up after they're gone. You got it all figured out. l got your back here, but you got to keep your distance and let me work this case. No one's gonna find these assholes. ls that what you need to hear from me? Are you fucking kidding me? They get a pass, you get a pass. That's the deal, right? What are you talking about, the shooters get a pass? l don't understand, Clady said you were on board. Not with this. What's the deal, are you throwing this case for a promotion? lf l were you, l'd be more worried about yourself. Hey, you piece of shit! You got a 1 87 on a peace officer and you're fucking letting the suspects walk! -You want these guys found? -That doesn't piss you off? -So they can put you at the store? -Doesn't it piss you off? Place you at the store before the shooting? You want to catch a felony for obstruction? lf l say you weren't there, you weren't there. This is your mess and l'm cleaning it up. Yeah, it pisses me off! (CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) Diskant. Yeah. Yes. Hang on one second. All right, go ahead. All right, thank you. Bye-bye. Fremont and Coates. The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt and the bandana outside the store. DNA corresponds to those two names. Congratulations, you lDed the shooters. Yeah. Normally, l'd be pretty happy. Pull their rap sheets. Give me copies. l'll see you around. Computer says you arrested these guys. Fremont and Coates. Good guys. Say hi for me. You remember them? Who can forget? Heroin dealers with a taste for blood. Came up from Belize to make a sale and they liked the Southland so much, they never left. Yeah. We hooked these two fine gentlemen on a rape-mutilation caper. Seems they had a three-day hostage-fest with this cute little Guatemalan chick that they snatched up when she was walking home from dental school. They hurt her bad. -Then why are they on the street? -SANTOS: They walked from the beef. One of our own felt we violated Mr. Coates' and Mr. Fremont's civil rights and told the City Attorney. -Washington dimed you out? -Yep. Why do you think they put the dude in Community Relations? Are you shitting me? Washington kicked loose the very guys who whacked him? Damn ironic, isn't it? Oh, guys! What is this, a garage sale? How you doing, Lud? What's this? Why... Lud, why do you have this? Those are the shitbags who popped Washington. Sarge, we can get these guys. No, no. Not if you want to keep your badge. Besides, these two animals? These guys, they'll take care of each other. They'll be dead by the end of the week. Probably shoot each other's fucking faces off, knowing these two. You know how that shit works. This week's suspects, next week's victims, right? Yeah, right. (BANGlNG ON DOOR) What the hell are you doing here, Tom? Let's talk. l'm sick of this shit, man. lt's the same damn song for three years. Crying about your wife. She's gone, Tom. What's it gonna take to bring you back from Mars? Have l ever asked you for anything? You know what? You ask me for shit all the time. Big things, Jack. lmportant things. What's up, Tom? Give me a green light to take out the assholes who did Washington. Come on, Jack. King's X. What the hell is this? l can lay them out like l did those Koreans, but off the books. l'm talking shovels and trash bags. Who's gonna know? Who's gonna care? The Koreans? That... That was business. This? This is some crazy bullshit rattling around in that drunk-ass mind of yours. Look at yourself! Look at yourself, Tom! You're a mess! When did you start drinking today? Your little airplane bottles of vodka? And you drove over here intoxicated. You want a second DUl? No one's going to fuck with me, Jack! You're not listening to me! You're not listening to me! No, you listen to me! This is much bigger than that. Do you think Biggs is stupid? He's got a PhD in catching cops slipping. You know this. You know all this. You got to hold your mud. Can you do that? lt's time to turn the page and close the book. They took $200? l... l forgot about it till l saw this. That's the man. That's him. He took all my pay. Said it was for the cookie jar. The cookie jar? That's what he said. (KNOCKlNG ON DOOR) l'll be right back. What do you want, Disco? Washington was dirty. He was a piece of shit. Why are you telling me this? l think you know why. l know why. -Are you recording this, huh? -That's a new phone. You working for lnternal Affeirs? You made one deal. Maybe you made two. Captain Biggs flip you to the dark side, punk? You know what? They're right about you. You are fucking out there. From now on, you stay away from me. We don't talk. All right, hold on, Disco. Hold on. Hold on. l gotta watch my own back these days, you know? Come on. Don't be mad. Washington was dirty. Hit me, princess. Go on. A couple things. You know we found $50,000 in cash on him at the store. No, l didn't. That's a lot of cash, but not in itself damning. Oh, but this is. Looks like an evidence tag. l found it in Washington's truck. l had SlD scan it. Corresponds to a kilo of heroin. Guess who comes along and signs out the dope? Washington? Washington signed out heroin and returned brown sugar. The guys who whacked him moved dope. You know, Washington sprung them from a rape beef on a technicality. No, l did not know that. Maybe they had a business arrangement. Maybe it was a hit. That would explain the heavy artillery. Washington deserved it, right? He was dirty, so fuck him. l feel much better about the suspects walking. And you, you must feel better too, right? We're doing the right thing. No shame if you want to take your pass. This has to be you and me. Why do you think we're in the goddamn bathroom? This is it. Last known address. (DOGS BARKlNG) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Okay. A family here now. Our boys are long gone. (HIP-HOP MUSIO PLAYING ON STEREO) All right, Disco. See those yahoos? l'm going to jam them. And when l do, one of them is gonna bolt. That's the one that's dirty. You bored or something? This is their hood. Anyone knows Fremont and Coates, they do. Hold this, mija. Get him. MAN: Get out of here, Supercut! (MEN SHOUTlNG) (CHATTERlNG) Fuck off. You're in the wrong neighborhood, homes.

They call me... They call me fucking Quicks, man. -Quicks? Not quick enough. -Quick. Hey, get me the fuck down, homes. Please, man, this shit's cutting me, dawg. Fremont and Coates. They were staying across from the house you were partying at. You know them? l don't fucking know them fools, man! l'm a fucking Southsider, all right, ese? l don't be fucking party with no brothers and shit. Man, what the fuck you doing? -They're from Belize. -Shit! -Who knows them? Who knows them? -All right! Who knows them? Look, mother... Hey, motherfucker, come on. All right, dawg. Look, look. Check this out, man. There's a baller cat on San Pedro, all right? Dude's name is Grill, man. He's from 40s town, ese. -Grill. 40s town. -All right. Yeah. Grill, man.

How many people knew he was talking to lnternal Affeirs? My husband had a good heart. And when he started listening to it, he became a pariah. His eyes opened. When will your eyes open? Terrence always said you were the worst one. Because with all the shit going on around you, you choose not to see. -Look, l came here to help you. -Help me? You came to help yourself sleep at night. That $50,000, you think Terrence was stupid? He knew he had a bull's-eye on his back the second he went to Captain Biggs. So we sold our house. We were leaving Friday for the Bahamas. To start over. Silly of us, wasn't it? Anything else, Detective? No. (LAUGHS) Lud! What the fuck? -Hey. How's Complaints? -Just missed your wife. -Oh. She was here? That's cute. -Yeah. l got something for you.

You expect me to leave my car in the hood, man? Someone had a party. Smell that? Want me to put it out? No. Get the murder book. This is Fremont. And this is his buddy, Coates. We found them. Great. Case closed. These guys have been here a while. There's no way they killed Washington. You think? Fuck you. l'm doing my best. lf Fremont and Coates didn't kill Washington, who did? Who're we chasing? The assholes who smoked these guys, harvested their DNA and planted it in the market. That's who. l'm with you. But why do you frame two dead dudes? We're going to ask them. Let's go. What's up, man? You know there's coyotes out here and shit, right? Y'all been gone a minute. You know these guys? No, man. l ain't never seen these dudes.

(ALL LAUGHlNG) l'd rather scrape up body parts at a traffic collision. See, Tommy falls apart when he's not chasing bad guys. He's always been like that. He was born without the fear gene. l could tell you some stories. -Tell me! -No, no, we don't kiss and tell around here. Now, l got the classic Tom Ludlow story. When he was a rookie, l took him under my wing. lt was a Friday night, and we're in Crip City, it's a project in Watts. Lots of dope, shootings, whatever, what have you. So, we get this call to shut down this house party. And Tom, he's like the saltiest boot ever, so l figured, you know, let's... Let's give him a lesson in humility. So l send him in there. Alone. (LAUGHlNG) And all of a sudden, all hell breaks loose, right? They got guys coming out the doors, homeboys flying out the windows... Everybody's screaming inside. l rush in, l charge in, and there's Tom, busting heads. They wouldn't turn the music down. Tom's always gonna be Tom. He's like a guided missile. Locks on, that's it.

Fremont and Ooates, or whoever they are, want to meet us. -When? -Tonight. l'll see you in Vice in an hour. l know it's late. l'm sorry. l wanted you to have this. And that is? lt's the video of your husband's murder. lt shows everything. Why are you doing this? Because l know how not knowing hurts. When l lost my wife, she was with another man. She had a blood clot in her brain and it burst. The bastard dumped her outside a hospital and... She died alone on the sidewalk. Linda, l'm sorry for wanting to hurt Terrence and l'm sorry for your loss. l want you to know he didn't die alone, and that the men who killed him are gonna pay. That won't bring him back. And that won't bring your wife back. l don't care. Not in my name. Please. Not in my name. Blood doesn't wash away blood. Shouldn't we roll with backup? -Fuck backup. -What? Why? What do you think is gonna happen tonight? You think l'm gonna throw the cuffs on these boys, drag them back to the barn and write it up? Here's the deal. l'm going out there and you're going home. And we are never, ever gonna discuss any of this again. What? What do you mean? lt means Fremont and Coates never existed, and we never met. l'm not going home tonight, Tom. Look, Paul. This thing you want, that you think you want, you don't want. You don't know who l am or what l want. Who are you to judge me? You want to be a gunfighter, huh? Then let's do it. Back on the night watch, Tom? You two keep being seen all over town. Tom? Did you really think l was gonna do nothing about you? lf you are gonna do something, do it now. l know you want my scalp nailed to your wall. But then who's gonna go where the law won't? You, Captain? You? You going to clean up the needles and baby parts? No. You need me. All you company men, you hate me, but you need me. (SlGHS) Ludlow, maybe you're right. Maybe we do need you. But goddamn if you don't need me, son. Hey, Detective. Did you ever ask yourself if Washington's dead because he was dirty or because he came clean? Swap your rounds out. We don't want the coroner digging department-issue ammo out of these assholes. Use the gloves. Jesus. These are some serious manstoppers. So we're just gonna go in there and kill them? No. l'm gonna ask them some questions. Then we're gonna kill them. Fucking time, man. We good? You know it's some bullshit, right? These dudes is monsters, man. l mean, if they can't fuck it, rob it or kill it, they don't want it. Ready? Yeah. Make the introduction. All right. l tried to tell you.

Everyone's out for theirs. Way of the world. Dude, cops are like weeds. You pull one out, and two more fucking grow back. Well, Washington got greedy. Don't shoot me now. l'm just gonna get something out of my pocket. This is just a sample. We're all about weight. We can help you transport, let you know if there's heat, let you know if you're selling to a narc or a snitch. Or bust people and sell you their shit. (CHUCKLES) (DlSKANT EXCLAlMS) We all about weight, too. Look at that shit. That's sexy right there. That's better than pussy. That's better than money. That ain't no Mexican tar, neither. That's that worldwide-war-on-terror dope, nigga. Pure Afghan, homie. Blood, we know this cat. lt's the same motherfucker that was in the market the day we pushed Washington's wig back. Hell, yeah.

Sit down, Tom. lt went bad, Grace. l know. l know. l should have gone alone. l took a boy to a gunfight. (GRACE SNlFFLES) Why are you crying? What's wrong? WOMAN ON TV: In our coverage of tonight's top story, Detective Tom LudIow, an 18-year veteran of the Los AngeIes PoIice Department, is wanted in connection with the shooting deaths of two undercover deputy sheriffs in the earIy hours of the morning. OfficiaIs have yet to confirm a third victim, who may aIso be a peace officer. In addition, they have stated Detective LudIow was off-duty at the time of the shootings, and is the onIy suspect in yet another tragedy... -Cops. -...in the Los AngeIes Iaw enforcement. MAN ON TV: Reports continue to bring you... How do they know that? That they were cops? l just left. lt's on the news? Did you do it? Of course you did it. l had no idea they were deputies. But l should have. "Exigent circumstances." Jesus. What is wrong with you? Huh? Why can't you have a normal life like everyone else? -l should go. -No. No. You're not going out there. This is gonna be a nightmare, Grace. l've got to go. No. No, Tom. This door is staying closed. Every cop in LA is hunting for you. You want to get killed? Grace. Grace. You need to get away from me. Okay? You need to get far away. Everything l touch dies. Down on the fucking floor! -On the fucking floor, now! -l'm not resisting! Don't say a fucking word. -No, please. -Shut up. Get up. You're an asshole. You're going down. Killed two fucking cops. What's the matter with you? Get that piece of shit out of here. -Downtown's the other way. -SANTOS: We're not going downtown. Where are we going? That bitch of yours is fine. -What? -So is Washington's widow. You're fucking them both, huh? (SANTOS LAUGHS) -Which one you feeling, Dante? -l like Linda. SANTOS: You shouldn't have given her the video, Lud. What the fuck were you thinking? You handed that bitch a death sentence. What the hell are you talking about? We've been watching you, asshole. How many times were you told to let it go? Hmm? How many? Cool, homes. Don't get him going. Hey, fuck him! Look what he's making us do. Smug fucking punk. Did you figure it out, Lud? Huh? How did Fremont and Coates make it to the market that day? After Washington got them kicked loose, you picked them back up. Took them to the hills and popped their melons, right? You should be a detective. We took some DNA samples first. Got a little hair, little spit. Voila! Fremont and Coates did it. Who signed out the dope? lt wasn't Washington. You. They were gonna incinerate it. Might as well sell and make a dollar out of it, you know? For you or the cookie jar? You're not that smart, Santos. Who was in? Silky? Clady? Wander. (SlGHS) lt's a Wander caper all the way. He's the only one who could pull those strings. He should have pulled your string years ago. We couldn't figure out why the fuck he kept you around all this time. Man, he's Jack's little pet. Been doing the man's dirty missions for years. Washington wasn't giving me up to Biggs. He was giving up the big dog. He was giving up the king. Wander played your fool ass, puto. We all have. You're a fucking chump, bro. Washington's killers, they really cops? Yeah, they were. Couple of deputies from the ghetto having the time of their lives. And making us a lot of money. -They were supposed to punch your ticket. -But you punched theirs. Yeah. Now we gotta punch yours. -Up in the hills. -Up in the hills, brother. First, we bag your hair, saliva and blood. When they find Linda Washington's corpse, guess whose DNA's gonna be all over it? And what is it gonna look like? Like you finally snapped, just like everyone knew you would. That little nurse of yours, Lud? You know, l'm popping a hundred milli Viagra and l'm gonna work that little brown ass. Then l'm gonna break her neck. (DeMlLLE SCREAMlNG) (TlRES SCREECHlNG) Get that fucking cuff out of my mouth, motherfucker! You... Get that piece of shit! SANTOS: Fuck you, motherfucker! You little motherfucker! Shoot that motherfucker! Motherfucker! (TOM GROANS) Well, hello there, handsome. Did you have a nice nap? (GROANlNG) Santos! Your girlfriend's getting away! (CHUCKLlNG) What are you doing, Lud? You crawling to your own grave? Watch me play with this fool. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (SANTOS WHOOPS) (GRUNTlNG) Oh! (EXCLAlMlNG) Legger! SANTOS: Yeah! Who's the boy now, motherfucker? Huh? Homeboy's gonna bury himself. Just do the fucking puto and let's go. (PANTlNG) So this is it, Lud. -This is how it ends. -DeMille, what the fuck? Let's go, bro! Shut up! l'm having fun! (TOM GRUNTS) (SHOUTS) (GRUNTlNG) (PANTlNG) Where? Where is the fucking disk? Huh? Where's the disk? Okay. (GASPlNG) Come here. You're a lot tougher than that piece of shit husband you used to have. You're getting ahead of yourself. We're gonna be here all night. (CRASH) (GRUNTlNG) (BONE CRUNCHES) (CLADY SCREAMlNG) You have to go, Linda. Wherever it is, you gotta go. Come on. l'm already packed. Take care of yourself, Detective. Where are you gonna go, cop killer? l let myself in. Clearly. You all right, Tom? l was worried about you. Apparently, l killed two deputies. Diskant's dead. Santos and DeMille dragged me off to die, so l put them down. Can you fix this, Jack? Oh, l'm going to fix it. l'm going to fix it. You know, l suspected that Santos and DeMille were capering with Washington, but l didn't want to believe this kind of shit was going on in my unit. Yeah. Me neither. Boss, you better get Clady up here. l need you guys. l'll get him in the loop. l'm gonna get him up here right now. You need an alibi. You were sleeping on the couch after the party. Santos and DeMille, they killed those deputies. Not you. Not you. (CELL PHONE BUZZlNG) This is Clady's phone. And his badge. All this is you. lt's you, Jack. lt's you. lt's you, Tom. Own it! Fucking own it! You knew they were cops! Those guys were so deep undercover that they... They lost their fucking minds! Don't mourn them. You can't mourn them. You set me up! You sent me in to die, Jack! l didn't set you up! You set yourself up! l was trying to save you! You backed me up in a fucking corner! -You killed Washington! -Fuck him! Fuck Santos! Fuck DeMille! Fuck Clady! Fuck them all! Fuck them all! They're a dime a dozen. You... You, man. You're special. You're special to me. And Diskant? He special? l watched a good man die because of you. That is entirely your fault. Come on, Tom. How do we get past this? We got a destiny. You and me. Nobody's getting past this, Jack. Everything ends now. You end now. (GRUNTlNG) (PANTlNG) l surrender! l surrender. Hook me and book me! There's a rover right there! Put it out! One for transport! Goddamn! Tom Ludlow, he got his man now! l found you. l made you possible. Now you need me more than ever, Tom. What did you think l'd do when l found out? Wait, man. Wait. Wait. My wall. lt's all there. ln the wall. These secrets, they're killing us. That's it. Open it up. Open it up! Tear it down! Tear it down! That's it. There it is. This is my power. This is my crown. l'm the king of secrets, Tom! l know which city councilman is doing lines. l know who likes boys. l know who's selling contracts. l know who... Who's beating his wife. l own them! Even the Chief is in my pocket, Tom. How do you think that l've been able to protect you all these years? What do you think it is that you're doing? All these missions, how do you think that you're able to touch the untouchables? l'm gonna be chief! l will be chief! l will be mayor! This is our world, Tom! So, let's take it! That why you put a hit on Washington? Why you tried to kill me? So you can keep stuffing money in your wall? But this is our money. The unit's. Who do you think paid for Silky's defense during all those lawsuits? Who's gonna pay for your retirement? l'm just correcting a flaw in the system, Tom. This is about cops helping cops. And if a teacher or a fireman could do it, they would do it, too. What happened to just locking up bad people? We're all bad, Tom. You were my best friend. We were family. (GUN COCKlNG) OFFlCER: Drop it, Ludlow! There's been enough killing. (OHATTERING ON POLIOE RADIO) l came as soon as you called. Guess you're first on scene. Nope. You are. Looks like Jack's friends got greedy and came after the money. -ls that what it looks like? -Mmm-hmm. This is your plan, Captain? Just sit back and let us all kill each other? You were the plan. No one else could touch him. Once your eyes were opened, there was no other outcome. Decisions were made, Tom, -by powerful men with powerful secrets. -Captain. They were afraid of Jack. They asked me to help. One day, you will pass the Chief in the hall and he will give you a nod. And you will know why. Because you were right, Tom. We do need you.
