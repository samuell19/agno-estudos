What was it again? Yoshida? Yes, Yoshida Shinichi. You feel better, huh? Young people recover so fast. I work in the office. Let me know if you need any help. Which tech school did you go to? I didn't. Just high school? And collage Really? So you're smart Which collage? I wouldn't even know it even if you told me. This is medium grit. This is fine grit. You keep the same angle like this. And do this. Try it. I can't. Just try. Like this. See? Elbow in. Keep them by your side. Here you go. Hello upstairs, please. That's enough. Sorry I'm late. Hi. Beer? Yes, please. Where's Ms. Hiromi? She can't come, no time. Is she mad. Are you angry? Ask her yourself. Can I have your number? I don't have a cell phone Are you serious? Everybody have a cell phone. Have Daddy buy one for you. I'm not a bank, you idiot. Here you go. Your appetizer and your orders. Another bottle and a Hoppy. One Hoppy. Okay. -Store manager - Hmm? This guy is from Tokyo. He's training with us. You must have some backbone. See you again That's sweet. - Can I see? - Hey. Ms. Hiromi is so pretty. You're too old for her. What's wrong with being old? She started working with us two years ago. When did you two get together. Wel.. We started seeing each other... Two years. What? Two years ago. They were fooling us all this time. Our master moves fast. You look embarrassed. I'm embarrassed. The surface is burned but it's raw inside. Yes... Get it right for once. You keep disappointing me. Do it properly or get out of the kitchen. Don't just stand tere and get to work. What do I do next. Huh? Forge it. I'll do it. One. Two. Three. Asa. Go out play outside. More? It's okay. I'm finished. No good. The edge is still dull. A blade will like this will make it uneven. Understood? Listen You just have to decide to sharpen it properly. Nobody can decide for you. You decide for yourself with your gut. I'm not cut out for this. Not cut out for this? Here, just do it. Get back to work. Yes, sir. For up to yesterday. No... You don't have to. It's not much. But… You need money I can tell. Take it. I can't take it. The room upstairs is little dusty. But I changed it and change the mattress. There are clothes in the chest. You're wondering why I'm doing this The boy wonders a lot. No spacial reason. Is that strange? Chose your own path. Everything in there is junk But you can use it as you like. Look at dad when you kick. Get behind it. Stronger. Good trap. Bigger. Hi. You're back. Here. Whoa. Not so much at a time. Fewer. Great day for the field. Asa has grown so much. Who's that? The new guy at the woodshop. Is that right? Now wonder I didn't recognize him. It's nice having a young man help you out. I have to keep an eye on him. One extra thing I have to do. Sharp-tongued as usual. The crime rate is going up. Lock up when you leave the house. I never lock the door. There's nothing to take. Just to be on the safe side. We're almost finished. Asa, clean up before the dinner. Asa, did you hear me? You are good. You can cook? I was a part time cook. Where? Just an ordinary restaurant. Ordinary? Part of a chain. That's good enough. He doesn't cook at all. I should cook more often. Don't worry about it. He's not fussy about what he eats. He's so good to me, I really appreciate it. What a coincidence. I'll cut some turnip. You guys are young. You'll eat more. Oh boy... Hi Sorry I'm not helping out. You had to work. Traffic jam? Yeah. I had to make delivery in Tokyo. A winter meal. Is there anything I can do? No. You must be tired. No. I'm fine. Really? Then will you take a look at shutters? They don't slide well. They come off when I try to move them. I'll fix them. I just don't know. Sometimes it seems like nothing has changed for Tetsuro in eight years. You didn't hear? About what? Car accident. His wife and son were on their way to her parents' house. His son was driving. What matters is that we're together. That's how I try to see it. You are getting stronger. At least your hot pots are always good. At least? Excuse me for being lazy cook. Ever since you moved back You do all the housework. So I great fully eat everything you make. Can't you be more polite? Like thank me or complimenting my cooking. Some things don't have to be said. Is that right? When you get married. Is Mr. Tetsu going to live with us? We don't know yet. Maybe one day. What about him? I don't know... Shinichi might prefer to live by himself. When we start living together You can call him dad. But.. Don't be embarrassed. Mr. Tetsu is fine. - You embarrassed too. - I'm not. You like salad. - You like veggies. - I love cucumbers. There's some more. But you hate mushrooms. What? I thought we had bottle of sake. You're drinking more? Let's call it a day. Here it us. I found it. Nice looking lady, isn't she? Was it taken overseas? In Hawaii. But I didn't go. You should have. Well.. I was busy. Too bad. I think she never got used to live here. She went on a lot of trips and visited her parents all the time. In the photos She only looked happy in the ones that I wasn't there for. That sucks. Shinichi too.. Maybe wanted to leave too. I just assumed, he wanted to enter the craft. When told me he didn't. I puncher him. Shinichi is my... I heard. Right there. I envy him. What? He was able to protest. It was the rule. My family spent every Sunday together. You have a nice family. It was a farce. My father dicided what we did on vacation. My big brother received all the praise. It was bullshit. They never expected anything of me. I'm an idiot. But I wanted to make them proud of me. Every family has its issues. Like they say, the home is like a prison. The harder I tried to be a good father, The worse I screwed up. I'm going to bed. Just a glass. Okay? Just one. It spilled. Hey. Yes? I'm stepping out for a while. Yes. This is Ashizwa. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hello? Hikaru? Where are you? Come home. Where's your cell phone? What am I doing? Really… You... Didn't do anything stupid, did you? Hikaru! I might never go home. I told you not to tell anyone. Stop dwelling on it. Yoshida. Yoshida? Pay attention. What's that for? What? Your hair. Weird? No! It looks good. Here. Thank you. Are you going to start your own business, Shoji? When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. If I could be one now, Would I change my profession? I don't think so. It's sort of depressing. You? What are you asking? Come on. Tell me. Soccer player. I believe it. Playing soccer Was the only decision I made for myself. But I quit during high school. I quit trying to be an astronaut when I was eight. Good. - Jacket? - Yeah. Really? - Aren't you hot? - Yeah. Then take it off. I'll hold it for you. When are you coming home? Wanna come with me? Did you fished before? I used to a lot. With your family? Yes. Oh... I've never gone sea fishing. How about you? I used to. I'd like to go with you one day. You said. You've been here before. Did I say that? When? Why? You must have had a reason for coming to the boonies like this. I went to the college two stops from here. Asahi Collage of commerce? Yes. We're you trying To kill yourself here? It's been bothering me. I wanted to ask you. I couldn't find a real job. There's nothing I want to do. It felt stupid working part-time. I got sick of myself. That's all. Death isn't the answer. Dying won't solve anything. No matter what your problems are. Then... What's the meaning of staying alive? A life like this isn't worth living. Nobody will grieve for me. This. Isn't yours, right? I found it here the other day. Not yours, is it? No. Then, that's fine. Good. I was setting up the futon... It's too early. Yes. Hello? Oh, you. He's here. - Hey. - Yes. Hey! Yoshida, is that you? Hello? Yoshida, are you there? I'm sure we've met before. I'm serious. Don't be fooled. This is her tactic with all the guys. - No. - Yes. I swear we've met before. Don't you remember me? Like I said, no. I'm new in this town. How old are you? Me too. What a coincidence. Which collage? One around here? I went to Asahi. Are you on Facebook? Stop bugging him. I'm sure he went to a better college. Why? He's smarter than you. Right? Hi, Yone. Mr. Yone. Hey. Who's your girl? Nobody. I just came here because I wanted to drink alone. The Usual? You're here for her. Shut up. Take a photo of us. I'll show it to a friend. - No. - Why not? Mr. Yone. - No photos. - Common. - I'll take it. - Sit down. Sit. - Ready? - Hurry. Say cheese. - Nice. - Stop. What's your problem? Sorry. I Judy bought it. I'll get you a new one. Forget it. I'm sorry. It's OK. Forget it. Oops. I forgot about this text from my wife. Call her on my phone. Thanks for coming. - Be careful. - Thanks. Hold on. I'll catch it. I remember now. He use to work at the restaurant That's become panchinko parlor now. Yoshida? It burned down in a fire several years ago. Oh yeah. So? Some people think it was arson. You don't know? I never heard that. The manager was in a coma after the fire. My mom said he passed away recently. What's your point? She has you wrapped around her finger. No she doesn't. Be careful. Women are scary. You're going home? Yeah. Anyway... You should take some rest. See ya. Let's go. Hey. Come on. Are you worried about what happened? Don't be an idiot. It was no big deal. I behaved worse than that. Forget about it. Yoshida. What wrong? Stop crying. I feel awful deceiving everybody. You know I'm lying about everything. Why don't you say something. Because I don't care. And that fire... Fire? It wasn't.. A simple accident. Manager and I were working late. There was a gas leak. I'd noticed it. The manager. He used smoke before he closed up the place. I knew lighting cigarette would be dangerous. The gas night ignite. I knew it could happen. Then it really did. Truth to be told... I hated him. That's why… What happened to him? He slipped into a coma. I went to visit him at last. But he'd already died. It was accident right? The gas leak. My son and I got into an argument. He cussed me out. He was being naive and idealistic. Then he asked me what my life meant. He acted so cocky. "You're and idiot, it doesn't mean anything" That's what he said. My last words to him. You're a victim. I'm not. We're no different. Actually.. You're better off than me. So... I don't torment yourself. From now on Start your life over as Shinichi. Ms. Hiromi Shinichi. I'm going home now. Do you have a driver's license? Or certificate of residence? No. Okay. So you don't have any ID to speak of. Do I need one? We'll need a copy sooner or later. Tetsuro insists the we don't although I don't know why. Bye. Shinichi, come here. I want to officially hire you. If you want, Shinichi. But.. I'm still useless. Take your time and learn. I want to show you something. We made it in 3 days during this busy period. Call it an employment gift. And this is from me. Open it! For all the money you'll be earning from now. I can't accept this. Please do. Hello. Wakui woodshop. We 're here with the tables you ordered. Thank you. Over there? Ready? Be careful. Cold today, isn't it? I'll bring some hot tea. Don't bother.

It's not about just party. When are you going to file a papers? Move in together? Clear this house? When things got real, You started turning your back on me. - I'm thinking. - You're lying. I'm not. What's wrong with you? All you care about is Shinichi. You're neglecting me. He's my apprentice. Of course I'd be concerned about him. Hey, Mr. Yoneyama!
