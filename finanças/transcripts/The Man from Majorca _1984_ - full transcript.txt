THE MAN FROM MAJORCA To Rosa Elmquist, Gransangargatan 6, 724 71 Vasteras This takes forever. Don't they have the parcels sorted beforehand? It doesn't seem so. - Bless you! - Thank you. The last thing I need is to lay sick in the middle of Christmas preparations. - So you are receiving a parcel? Or you are sending parcels or what are you doing... No, no one is sending any parcels. No one wants to talk to people. It's typical for this swedish people: you can't say a word before they turn away! Hey, Johan. You know that the gingerbreads are home made this year? - Really? - Olle's wife. - He will have to bring 200 pieces. - Well, I think he can afford that. Hell, to sit here, two grown up men, and watch the front door at a whorehouse at the best working hour when you can be inside in the warmth with a cup of... You see that, Jarnis! - A big fish in a small pond. It's her, right? Sure as hell it is Eva Zetterberg! She is good looking. If you didn't know she was a hooker... you can't tell that from the outside. Here she goes. Maybe she is going for a home visit. What in the name of... That is 189,30. What are you doing, human? Don't do anything hasty! Don't do anything hasty, I said! Think of what you are doing! My god, don't do anything that you will regret! No! Think of what you are doing! Don't do anything hasty that you will regret for the rest of your life!!! - Assault alarm, post office, Stockholm 6. - We're on our way. To hell the hookers! Johan! This time we will be there first! - The Lucia procession! - Yes, I hear... Johan, damn it, they have moved! Stop! It's the police! Damn! Where did he go? - Mmm? - Which way? - Go? What are you talking about? HOMICIDE DEPARTMENT CHIEF INSP M. DAHLGEN I was just going to leave this hat, it's from the technical department. - No, I can take it. Where was I? I must rely on... It was this hat that he was wearing. We must rely on witnesses, the pictures are a joke as usual. They are on the table if you want to see. No fingerprints - car gloves. However: a footprint, he happened to step on a form set. Shoe size 41. That was it. This looks like today's main dish in the lunch room! - Those maniacs have dimmed the light and used candles, for the sake of the feeling... What a hell of idea! They could as well sent invitations to every criminal in town One gets struck by the coldness of the robber. I was thinking of Lars-Peter Forsman, is he on leave today? - Lars-Peter Forsman is green and checked. He is sitting in the bunker. - Forsman would never had pulled off this kind of raid. Compared to this guy, Forsman is an amateur. - He vanished in the school, that shows local knowledge. Check the teachers and the pupils. See if anyone has a criminal record. And our colleagues in the ape-house down the yard... He, who has changed his name, and the other who has kept it, what's their names? - Jarnebring and Johannson, respective, from central investigation. Yeah, talk to them. They were the first at the scene. They are cops, after all. Maybe they have figured something out now that they had some time. Yes. Is it anything else to add? - Yes, one thing. One of the cashiers had a bad cold. Maybe the robber got infected? Excellent, excellent. Yes, then we know what to do. We must find a young man, shoe size 41, his face looks like today's main dish and he will start to sneeze in about three days. Brilliant, gentlemen, brilliant. Damn! Not even invited to the planning meeting. Fucking Dahlgren. After all, we were the first at the post office. - We are on the wrong squad, Johan, I have always said that. - They think they are something up there. First squad... As if we don't know how to behave... You don't need to show your press card, I know you belong to the fourth estate. This is about what you saw at the post office. What did the robber look like? - Well... He was bearded. - Bearded? Wait a minute. You didn't say before that he had a beard. - Yes, yes! Bearded... or... no, he had sideburns. Italian, probably. - Did he look like an italian? But you said before that he was blond. - Yes! Ingemar Johansson, that is. - Ingemar Johansson? You know he who fought against Machen... - Yes, I'm sure as hell who Ingo is. Did he look like him? - That's right! But... no... Machen. He was much more sturdy. - Wait, wait a minute! - Ingo was more sturdy. - Wait a minute. You say that... - But the other guy... - Wait, Ingemar Johansson, what he has to do with anything? Do you mean that the robber looked like Ingemar Johannson? - No, no, no, no... - But why do you suddenly start talking about Ingemar Johansson? - Because the guy who was there... - The robber, yes! He was very sturdy. But! Ingemar Johansson, he was more sturdy. You know, I saw Ingemar beat Machen. - Yes? I mean: did the robber look like Ingemar Johansson or Machen? - No, he looked like the other guy. - Do you mean that he was more like Eddie Machen than like Ingemar Johansson? - Yes, he was more like Eddie Machen... but colored. - Who? - Machen! -Yes, he is colored, but the robber wasn't fucking coloured? Thank you Olsson, I don't know how we could manage without witnesses like you. - Don't mention it. It was... It was nothing. What an ice cold bastard. - Who? - The robber! Stop dwelling on that now, can't you forget that damned post robbery? I mean 395 000, alright, is a lot of money... - Think of it. It wasn't The Great Train Robbery! - But it is not about the money. It was about that he was so damned cool! He didn't make any mistakes. There is bullet proof glass that goes up to the ceiling. What does the bastard do? He jumps after the parcel right to the parcel department! - What do we have here? Look, look, look... He starts to pull the cashiers away from the alarm buttons. Up with polo-neck sweater, on with ladies hat, karate kick in the door. - No, maybe I saw wrong. The Lucia procession he fixed like a piece of cake, nice and neat. Think of it, if it had been an amateur at work, he would have massacred the kids! Incredible man. Congratulations! The new idol, John Travolta of the robbers! Told you so! Do you know who it is? Hedberg and Ost from SAK. You mean the Security Service is visiting whorehouses in Ostermalm? Damn, it's them! Are they customers? - I believe a lot of things about Hedberg, but he does not pay to fuck. He was picked from the police force to protect judges. - Now they are leaving. We should write it down, in any case. - You do that, Jarnis. Use the sharp side. Of the pensil, that is. Isn't it exciting? Would you please stop it, thanks. - Every time I come home, you sit and look in that damned telephone directory. It's worn out of browsing! - What the hell, I was going to call a pal, is that forbidden? - That's what I'm afraid of, that you're going to end up with your old gang, your old "pals". What's the matter, Rogge? You haven't been yourself since... - It's just an ordinary classmate. You understand? A perfect ordinary classmate, OK? It has nothing to do with my old life, it's just an ordinary buddy. OK? - When was it? - Tuesday. Hello, boys! Really Andersson, you dared to come down here to the ape house? - I just wondered if you had come up with something new about Stockholm 6. - How the hell could we? We work at the cunt division, if you didn't know that! It seems to be a robbery of type 2: former unknown offender. Even if we had found fingerprints, we couldn't use them. The man isn't in any register, this could be difficult. Hey, what's the matter with Johansson? - Why? - Well, he's loosing his temper! - He is tired. Tired of the whole shit. Look around, Andersson! "The mills of justice"... And I don't think he has gotten over his divorce yet. It's not that funny to thaw meatballs by yourself and lay the table for one person. You think of that, when your wife brings you your slippers! - What about his wife, doesn't she work here in this building? I mean his ex-wife. - She works at the foreigner division. She fell in love with a colleague. A graduate in Law. Future commissioner of police. They took the kids and moved to Taby. The new boyfriend bought a house there a month before. How about that? Johan agreed to everything. He even used the same lawyer from the divorce. A pal of the wife's new boyfriend. It looked as if he just watched everything that happened from the side... End of small biography. I'll be damned! Ost and Hedberg from the secret police. For the first time without false beards! Have you had that staff party yet? Staff party... What staff party? - But wasn't it a suitable place you were looking for? We saw you outside a disreputable place in Ostermalm the other night. A real "haunt", as we real cops say... We thought SAK was planning a staff party, and you belonged to the party planners. I don't know what you are talking about. Anyway, we haven't seen you and we're damned happy about that! - How the hell could you? We are investigators. "See but not be seen", our saying. - De the jail's clients have permission to be here in the police dressing room? - Some of them might have that. The most filthy ones... are granted a special exemption. What? Who do they think they are? What's the matter with you? - No, no, it's nothing. Hell, you must be insane! What do you mean? The Golf refused to start, I got to rent this for the same price. It goes up to 230 km/h... 260! - But we have no use of that in the city! - The feeling, Johan, the feeling of having more power under the hood than you need! - Come on. Let's go before our colleagues see us. - With pleasure. Look, Johan, over there! Isn't that Sven Roland Martinsson? - Sure as hell he is. - Isn't he wanted? - He's supposed to be at Hall prison, he has run away from leave of absence. Svenne! Welcome in to the warmth! You have lost your style, Svenne. I thought you were doing bank business, with a sock on your head. - Yes, so what? - Where the hell are you going? - I thought we could drive him to Hall. Svenne. I could use your help with a thing. Who robbed the post office at Dalagatan on Lucia day? They moved to Halsingegatan then. - Well, you are not the first to ask, that much I can tell. - Yeah? - No, it was one of the young guys who went around and asked. - About who did the robbery? - Well, it wasn't one of us, that I can tell you. You know, eh... Lars-Peter... ... what do we have now... Nicke and Mauritz, are sitting in Kumla. Bogdan, Lasse and Bo, they are sitting down with me. No, you have to look for your guy elsewhere. - Svenne... - No, you have to do some more thinking. Svenne. You don't remember how he looked like, he who asked? - Hey, I don't socialize with young criminals, I have to keep my reputation, you know. - Come on, remember it. Maybe we will forget what we saw earlier. What do you mean, "saw"? I haven't seen anything! - He looked like those who lived on Plattan. Foreigner, golden ring in the ear, damned pimply face. Hey, seriously, Johansson, do you really believe that I socialize with foreigners with a ring in the ear? 22 minutes. New personal record between Fridhemsplan and Hall, could possibly go below that. If you walk the last bit, it will be counted as a remorse. And you'll get a discount on the extended sentence. Good bye! The money! You heard me, right! The money! Let's grab a hamburger, shall we? - I don't eat McDonalds hamburgers. - Are you insane? "Don't eat McDonalds hamburgers"? We have eaten about 10 tons since they opened in Sweden. Yes, true. But it's over with that now. What is suddenly wrong with them? It's 100 %% beef, got five stars in Rad & Ron. - But it's not that, Jarnis, it's not about the meat. - But what the hell is it about then? I don't think one should support international corporation or monopoly. But that's the kind of stuff that the kids were doing 10 years ago, it's 1983 now, Johan! - Let me put it this way: it's hard times for Sweden. Therefore I don't think one should support american hamburger companies. What the hell have they done for us Swedes? You tell me! Good, Johan, good! Hey! It was Swedish, but tasty? Fuck no! It's cold. We should get another one. You should have been at the Olympics in St. Mouritz in 1952. Minus 30 degrees! St. Mouritz? 1952? Then it was held in Oslo! - Never mind. - It was in Oslo! If you had travelled round the world commentating sports it's not that damn strange if you mix up a thing or two. - But you have mixed up wrongly! I have an appoitment, I've got to go! - What? Wait a minute! - It's about money! Money! Money! - What money? - What money? - Vasteras! - Vasteras? - Vasteras! What a damned con man, he just took off! SKOGSKYRKOGARDEN THE WOODLAND CEMETERY Maybe you want some more grog? - No, thanks, I... The duty starts soon, so... It's best to stay sober, you never know what can happen. "Schhheventy five coins is the price for a ppptty cookie with ssscchhhop between the wrappers" Do you remember? It is Jarnis, yes, I have to go. - Couldn't you invite a colleague for some grog? - No, really, we must go, I'm sorry. Bye, Konrad! Good bye! - Thanks to you. - Thanks. - Merry Christmas! - Bye! - Good bye! - Bye! - You got that? Nice! - Yes, he made it by himself at the kindergarten. - You got socks also? - Yes, nylon... He is gone. Grandpa. Goodbye! - No, no, don't hang up! Hello, Anderss... Santa is here. Not a shoe print. He must have sweeped up the tracks before he got in the car. Thank you. I thought it seemed strange, that's why I remembered the number. Drive all the way here with the car. It did some damage to the burial grounds. - FUK 838 is not in the register. Mrs. Wistrom, maybe you got the number wrong? It's hard to see the difference between 3s and 8s. No... No, I saw the car just under the light, and I'm sure it was 838. We have to go with 8s and 3s, check all possible combinations. It wasn't 838, check the other seven combinations. Didn't you think of anything else, just then? No, nothing that I saw, that is. But I think I know who he is! - Know who he is? - I mean, the victim. I think his name is Olsson. Erik or Eskil Olsson. I work at the emergency at Sabbatsberg hospital and our problem children are these old men hanging around the subway. - There is a FUK 833, a brown Volvo 142 at Esso car rental in Gardet. - Johansson. - Jarnebring. - It was kind of you to come here, it's Christmas eve and everything. - No big deal, I've just been watching the damned TV all evening. They only show that damned Educational Broadcasting and stuff! It's five past 12, so it is now Christmas day. I take the opportunity to wish you a merry Christmas. Brown Volvo 142 FUK 833, here it is. It's better to wait for the CSI, they can find a thing or two on these. - Hey, do you think someone could have driven this car, despite it wasn't rented? I will tell you one thing: this bloody car I can open and start with my thumb! I'm finished now, you can go in. Hell, what a pigsty! - Look at the bookcase instead. He was a hell of a photographer. - Something interesting? - No, mostly holiday pictures. Damned, you can see nipples through the blouse! It says something on the back: "PIG PARTY, 1978, MAJOCRA" It should be Majorca. Funny bastard, this Olsson! Right, I've got the names of the ones who have rented the car this year and had the chance to copy extra keys. I should also write down the meter reading, do you have it? - Yes, it's here: 14 385. Jarnis! Check the meter reading. Come on... 14 437! - 14... 4 3 7. - Is that good or bad? It's a difference of 52 km. Let's see, what's the distance between Skogskyrkogarden and Gardet, almost 20 km? Go there and come back: 40 km. Plus... - Plus 12 km for additional driving! Well, that's not an ordinary drunk manslaughter. With these ones they don't go into the trouble of packing and transporting the corpse. We need people if we are going to solve this, and I'm going to fix that now. - Try Johansson and Jarnebring. - Those investigators? Do we need to go this far? Don't we have any own? - No, it looks bad. Hamren and Gunnarsson are away on Christmas holidays. Baah! Then I'd rather take Rundberg. What a Christmas! Only soft gifts, the tree started to shed its needles December, 23, pre-bought brawn. I might as well work under those conditions. What's this? Is this our corpse? Damned, this is Erik Harald Olsson, the maniac I interrogated about Stockholm 6! - Stockholm 6? Then Olsson was at the post office when the robbery occured? And you interrogated him? So where is the interrogation print-out, if I may ask? - Merry Christmas! - Thank you... Look, Dahlgren, Olsson was at the post office when the robbery occured, Rundberg interrogated him. - Really? Why haven't we been notified until now? - Rundberg never printed out the interrogation with Olsson. - What a fucking maniac! - I'm sure it's going to be alright with your hat, Mrs. Forsberg. - Yes, but you have had it for quite a while. - You'll get it as soon as the technical division is finished with it. Should we focus on this now? - It wasn't him, then? - No. - That's him! - Is this the man who stood behind you in the queue at the post office? Yes. Do you remember anything special about him? - Yes... No. Nothing other that he seemed to be drunk, as I told. And he greeted the robber. - Did he greet the robber? - Yes. Why haven't you told us this before, Mrs. Forsberg? - Well, no one asked. He, the other inspector who interrogated me before, he just wanted to know how the robber was dressed. Have I done something wrong? You heard that it didn't go well with the car in the Esso garage? It was one of the employees who had secretly borrowed it. - Yes, I heard. Time for a coffee break, Johan. To pull ourselves together. Pimples all over the face, golden ring in the ear. Damn, it's our foreigner! Be careful with my watch, it's more expensive than you, you swine! Damned cop, go to hell! What the hell! You let me go, you damned swines!!! Damned cunts! Damned suck... Damn... Let me go! Damned pig cunts, let me go, damn it! For hell's sake, let me go! - Police! - That's why he is scared, you damned pig! Five tiny bags is nothing to make that hell of a noise for! - What do you know about the post office robbery at Dalagatan on Lucia day? Halsingegatan? Damn, do you have hearing problem? What do you know about the robbery at Halsingegatan, Lucia day? - I know nothing. Fucking cop! Don't ask about stupid things... - You better start talking now, damn it or else you may fall out of the door, it had happened to better boys than you! - It was Rogge who asked me, damn it! It was... It was Rogge who asked me to look for your pal. - Hello, Andersson! - Hello! - Do you have Stockholm 6 there somewhere? - That's the one I'm working at right now! Jansson, Roger Jansson, do you have him? - Jansson, Roger Percy. - Yes. Previous convictions, not interrogated. He went to the school next to the post office. This came to light when we checked the pupils. - Damn, it's him! - He who? - He at the locker in the school, when I was chasing the robber! I will talk to him as soon as I get time. - I think it's too late. He's supposed to be dead, murdered, run over by car! Jansson asked this Papalexis to find a person with a connection to the robbery at Stockholm 6. And then, when Papal... We found an interesting foreigner, he's up at level 4. - I know. - You know? How the hell do you know that? We just took him! - Intuition. Go on. And when Papalexis found out from Jansson's fiancee that he was "murdered by car", according to her, he realized that this was serious, and therefore stopped his search. After that we haven't got a word from him, he just zipped his mouth. Papalexis refused to tell who he was looking for, or whether he ever found him. - You seem to have high death rate among the ones involved in Stockholm 6. If this Jansson was really run over by a car, it will be interesting to see who the driver was. In my office, as soon as you get the information. Yes, Jansson is dead. He died in a traffic accident on December, 20 last year. Hit by a car. The prosecutor did not press charges: no manslaughter. The one who carried out the investigation at VD 4 wasn't there, the officer who answered the phone didn't remember the driver, other than it was an ordinary decent citizen in his middle ages. They still exist! We will soon find out, the file is on the way by car. OK. Well, then we have some time for speculations. What is common between a 22 year old criminal, a 57 year old alcoholic and an ordinary decent citizen in his middle ages? - Maybe they have been to the same prison? - That's hardly possible, they never mix such clients at penal institutions. Besides that, Olsson has never been in prison, other than for booze and disorderly behaviour. It looks to me like a group holiday to Gran Canaria. Right? It usually is a strange mix of people on those trips. - Maybe you're on to something. I remember when we searched Olsson's home, we found a lot of photos from a pig party at Majorca. PIG! Damn it, PIG!!! - How are you doing, Johansson? - It's a pig who has done it. - Pig, that's what criminals call us, it started in America. Pig! - But stop now, what are you raving about? - It's a colleague who has done it. It was Hedberg I saw at the school. Hedberg, the colleague from SAK! Do you remember when we were at the dressing room at Healthis and met Hedberg and Ost? I got so damned thoughtful when Hedberg passed the door. I couldn't understand why. It's his back! The same back that I chased in the corridors of the school after the robbery! - But can one really recognize someone from the back? - Of course! The same back! Exactly the same way to pass through doors, if you know what I mean. No. - Jarnis, think! Do you remember when we drove Sven Roland Martinsson to Hall? The whole guy was a big damned hint that it was a colleague who had done it. And Papalexis was not afraid about the bags he had on him, he was afraid that we would beat him to death! Urgent, came from VD 4 by car. Hedberg, Kjell Goran - A punk-rocker back then. - Poor bastard. Tried to blackmail, ended up under a tyre. And this is Olsson, nice and shaven. But where is Hedberg? - Look, dudes, there he is! The judges' bodyguard... Your documents, there was something strange with them. Did you notice that the same day that Rogge was killed? - Yes. - But couldn't it be Rogge himself who touched the documents? No, because when I was getting a bank book at home in the morning it was in order, but in the evening it was in different order! - Hey! - Yes? - Will you find the way yourself? - How childish this is! - But what? Little friend, it's the only way to solve your bilateral contradictions! Vindeln! Vindeln! - Hello! - Hi there. Hey! You don't know anyone called Olsson? Erik Harald Olsson, the sports journalist who was murdered? - Sure as hell I do. - You do? And how was he? - How he's doing? - How he was doing. - He was murdered! - Yes, I know. Well, now I think he's feeling pretty well compared to before. - But that bastard fooled me! - Really? Yes, I had a half-part of the vodka that we were going to split at Christmas eve. - That really sucks! - Yes, I think so, damned... We planned a nice Christmas together! He fooled me. So I went home to him and rang the bell. No one opened. And then... then another dude came... And I sat down it the stairs and waited. I think this really sucks, that he would fool me, that was my last money! - Another guy came and sat in the stairs? - No, I sat in the stairs. Then a guy came and was doing something with the door... - Vindeln! So I went down and said: "Hey, kid!" And then he turned around and I saw that it wasn't Olsson! - Can we do this: we write this down at our place? - What? Are you from Crim? Yor are a cop? - Yes... But hey... - No, I have half-part over there! - But I can buy you a whole bottle that you can have for youself! Is that OK? Let's go? Please, drive us to a liquor store. The guy you saw, it wasn't one of these? Yes, it was him! I think this is really creepy, couldn't we just look at pictures? - Yes... Lower your voice, Mrs. Forsberg! But with the last inspector it was enough to look in a little box with light! - Yes, but as I tried to explain to you over the phone, the court is pretty severe nowadays. The prosecutor would argue that you were more tied to the photo in that case, so we have to do it this way. Please look again. - No, it's not any of them. I think... I don't know if I can make it. But who says he's going to eat here exactly today? Even if he usually does that? - Of course I can't promise that! - Every person would surely like to change dining place from time to time, for the variation? - But he is a man of habits, Hedberg is a man of habits. There he is! It's him! Johan, are you hungry? Well, if you say kebab, I'll kill you! - No, no. I thought PLO-food was your style? No, this is guaranteed all-swedish, fried in Eve margarine from Konsum, is that good enough? What? How about that? Even the crispbread is swedish, from Rattvik. - Hell, do you see that? - What? - The car number! Skogskyrkogarden! The fake plates that weren't in the register! - Did you see if it was Hedberg? - No, but it must be Hedberg, couldn't be no other! What? Driving around with fake plates. He must know that this number is dangerous! - Damned lunatic! Over there, eight cars ahead! I have him now. Fuck! There we go! Go back in line, damn it! Jarnis, don't you see the car? Go back! - What? I've got an opening here... Jarnis!!! -Damn, I'm so tired of you. - Well, we are alive, aren't we? - We got 10 cars behind, was it worth it? - Here we go! Come on, now! Hold your hat now, Johan! We got two... Where the hell is the scumbag? - There! Under the railway bridge! He thought he could fool us, that bastard! What the hell? It's not him! Who the hell do you think you are? Bullitt? - I... I... I confess everything! I... I can explain everything... - Never mind, do that up in the jail. Could you repeat the last thing? - He said that a witness has seen your car at Skogskyrgogarden on Christmas eve, with a corpse in the trunk. The technicians will confirm that, a corpse named Olsson! But maybe you know that? - Were there two persons involved in this? What's your friend's name? Is he telling the truth, that bastard? Almost too good to be true! This guy couldn't make it on time to pass the vehicle test and to avoid a fine until he gets there, he altered the last digit. But if it's true what he says... And if he has an alibi for the Christmas eve... Then how the hell did the car show up at the graveyard? - But don't you get it? Someone has borrowed the car in the street, done his business, and then put it back nicely in the street, that's how to do it! Only amateurs leave the cars in the ditch. - What an icecold bastard! - Hedberg is an icecold bastard, you should know that by now. -You think Hedberg did it? - Of course, sure as amen at church. I saw this photo in an old Expressen... and I thought... This is that wino who came to the guard and asked about a policeman who was supposed to work here in the house. But there was no one with that name in the directory, and he got really noisy. And I threatened to "call the police"... But I took him out to the street and wrote a memory note about it, we have our instructions. I thought it was something trivial, so I didn't report it. This happened on Monday, December 22? Yes, because I went on Christmas holiday to Gambia on December, 23. That's why I didn't hear about this murder until yesterday. You don't remember the name of the person that he was asking for? - No, but it was something with "Hed". Hedfors, Hedberg, Hedkvist... It's written in the note but I can't remember where it has gone. You heard that he has an alibi for the Christmas eve, that Bullitt? He was with his family eating porridge all evening. - Yes, I heard. But his car was there! The castings matched perfectly. I don't thing Hedberg was eating porridge, he had other things to do... 70 to 1648. 1648 here. Go to the Dalagatan office, at once! Got it. Damn, it must be something crucial. Alright, it's time to work. Andersson, you make a detailed list of everything we know. It must be finished by tomorrow morning. Item by item, so I can show it to the prosecutor. We might as well inform him about our suspicions about Hedberg right away. And we must also get a search warrant for his home. I will contact SAK and ask what Hedberg was doing on Tuesday morning, 13 December 1983, and on Christmas eve's afternoon. We will meet here tomorrow at 1 PM. COURT OF LAW - I can continue, then? - Yes, I'm not going to stop you. This was a hell of a story! First I'm going to contact SAK. They are calling for me, I have to go. Then we have an agreement? Yes, I think we can help you with that. Come along here and we shall... ... take it out. Tuesday the 13th... Hedberg... Kjell Goran Hedbergs list of duty, here you go! Hello, it's Berg. I think we've got trouble! 6 minutes left. Do you think that bastard has given up and confessed by now? Let's go, I can't wait another second! I have spoken to SAK about Kjell Goran Hedberg's possible alibi. We can forget the whole thing. Hedberg is not our man. He actually has an alibi. - But that's impossible! You have to explain this further. - Yes, I was going to. This is the case: On Tuesday, December 13, Hedberg has alibi for the whole day, from 9 AM to 5 PM. The fact that SAK can't give him an alibi for the Christmas eve, he was off duty that day, is in these circumstances of less interest. - Yes, but the fact that he was working on December 13 doesn't mean that he couldn't have visited Stockholm 6! - He has a so called witness, if you are familiar with this term, and according to the witness they haven't visited Stockholm 6. - If it's his colleague Ost who is that witness, then I don't give much for it, not a damned thing! - I'm afraid that it is better than that. - It sounds like the king himseld has got up from his throne and witnessed in Hedberg's favour. - Who is it? Well? You tell us! - I am prevented from telling you, with respect to the security of the state. Is this all that you can say? - Yes. Unfortunately. Yes, that's all. Jarnebring! You forgot this. - No, no, you keep it. I am donating it to the art club, you are the keeper, right? Don't you like my little piece of art? What I mean is that you have to be careful or the blindfold will slip down Mrs. Justice's head and shut her mouth. I named it "The Security of the State"! - What do we do now? - We follow that bastard. - Who? You mean Hedberg? - Yes. If he didn't have a tail before, he is sure as hell going to have one now! Hey. Here he comes. Look what he's bringing! - He turned off the light now. - The foreplays are getting shorter and shorter. Third night in a row, different girls every time, how the hell does he manage this? - I have no fucking idea. - No, this isn't beneficial. - Not for us, that is... Hey Johan, tomorrow will be the last day. The colleagues start to wonder what the hell we are doing. - They are not cheap, those Mercedeses. - 100 000 at least! - But now he can afford to buy even more. Next time it will probably be Mazerati! - Now he pulls over. Palmgrens leather. - What is it? What is he buying? - A dog leash. He has no dog. He damned surely has no dog! She wraps it up in a present box. He is going to give it to someone. Here he comes! Rosenbad. What is he going to do here? Bodyguard for a cabinet minister, of course. - What the hell, this isn't beneficial! OK? Fuck parties, dog leashes and cabinet ministers... - He takes the present with him. Why, if he's going to serve as a bodyguard? Yes, he went to the Minister of Justice's room. But something was strange. I don't think he ever knocked the door, or waited for the green light. I mean... A minister... You have to know a minister well to act like that! You see? He doesn't have the dog leash. - He gave the leash to the Minister of Justice as a present. When did bodyguards start to give their employers presents? Without thaking for a favour? For example, an alibi? Damn, this must be a hot shot! The alibi could be here in Rosenbad! - But why the hell would the Minister of Justice give Hedberg an alibi? Maybe he did something himself. Something so toxic that he is willing to give alibi to a murderer! - What the hell could that be? - Yes, what the hell could that be? That's him, right? This is Hedberg's alibi? THE MNIISTER OF JUSTICE How did you figure that out? - Unfortunately, we are "prevented to tell, with respect to the security of the state"... - Hedberg was a bodyguard for the Minister on Lucia day, right? - Extra called-up bodyguard, yes. After a telex from the German BND stating that three terrorists had entered Sweden or Denmark the night before... Sit down, boys. They picked him up in Nacka at 8:30 AM and drove to the government meeting. They stayed there until 9:45 AM. After that they had consultations with some high party officials in the city. There were consultations until 1 PM, and then back to the government building. There they had a late lunch, followed by work until 3 PM, after that home to Nacka again. An arm-length distance the whole day, that is, between the Minister and Hedberg. Yes. Minister of Justice writes a detailed diary, that's why he is so certain about times and places. To conclude I just want to say this: I don't think the Minister of Justice and Hedberg are partners in the Stockholm 6 robbery. - Neither do we. - No? So what do you think then? - We think he has done something else that neither stands the light of the day, and therefore he lies about Hedberg's alibi. - Like what, for example? - Between us... Between us three in this room, we have our thoughts. - I know, I know what you are about to say, Johansson. But one thing is sure: this newspaper seems to be the biggest gossip central when it comes to questioning morals. The other thing is that I'm definitely not going to use this as an evidence in a murder investigation! What are you going to do now? - We will follow him. - Misconduct. - We already followed Hedberg, and we must break his alibi! - Misconduct, but I don't care. I'm not your boss, and I am happy about it. - So are we. - Well, then the pleasure is mutual! You know what I think about that solo actions in police work. There is nothing worse than stubborn cops, These Kings of the Royal Mounted, their days have passed long ago! - So that's how he lives. - Yes, there are some people who... - What is he watching? - Some people in the seats on a stand. If only we had sound. No, following Hedberg was more fun, a bit more action. 70 here. This is 1607 Jarnebring. Yes? - Hakan, do you have a TV there? - Yes, why? - Will you turn it for us? - Which channel? - Channel 2. - What the hell are you up to? That's non of your damned business. Just turn it on so that we can hear the sound. Smart, right? - That's good, Jarnis. - He switched the channel! - What is it now? - "Golden cartoons for grown-ups"... - Hey Hakan, damn it, switch to channel 1 now! - Why on earth do you need it? OK, wait a second. What the hell? He switched back again. What a fucking dolt! Conclusions: we know that Hedberg has no alibi for the robbery. Now we must find out how much Dahlgren and his men know. We must keep an eye on his investigation. Take the necessary measures. - How far can we go? Can we use the Japanese equipment? - Has it arrived? - Yes, Lasse Jernberg is in Tokyo and bringing it to us. - Well, you see. What are you waiting for? - But how are we going to act in regard of the point at issue? - The point at issue? - Hedberg's possible crime. - You mean, whether he has done it or not? Has he committed robbery, murder and manslaughter? I didn't really have the time to think about it. This question is of relatively low priority now. - No... Not again! - What is it? - Do you need the sound? I can call Hakan. - Fuck no, I can't manage... Doesn't he have any interests? Look! Here comes his wife. At last we have some action! Hey, watch out, they're coming up! - He turned the light off. - The old man turned the light off, yes. Is he going to bed or what? Where is he? - No, there he comes! - That's right, and he is in a hurry... Do you smell it? This whole thing smells cunt... Third or fourth floor, I could't really hear. We will see when they turn off the light! - How can you be sure about that? Do you always turn the light off? There! Goodbye! - Any luck? - Do you know who she is? Eva Zetterberg. - Eva Zetterberg?! Jarnis, think. Think! - Damn, you mean this is where Eva Zetterberg was headed that morning... Then Hedberg's alibi cracks! Stockholm 6 is in this very neighboorhod, the robbery took 3 minutes. - Even if the Minister of Justice was horny and quick as a rabbit, Hedberg had enough time to rob the post office and get back here. - What do we do now? - Knock the doors. - Too late today. Tomorrow? - 9 AM. - 8:30 AM? - 8 AM! - Johan? Do you have something to eat? Yes, it was that day. It was on the Lucia day when he... The Minister of Justice visited her and I thought: How can he come to a woman on a day like that, when so many of his subordinates are in the street? After all, he is the highest superior of the police force! - Were there many policemen in the street? - Yes, a lot of them. There were police cars, patrol cars, other cars... It was on that day. And I thought it was strange that such a fine man could come to a woman, because I know what they are doing there together! She lives in the flat just above mine. - Mrs. Wahlberg... - Yes? If I can help, i will gladly do so. - Excellent. Are you absolutely sure about this? - Yes, I'm sure. - Absolutely sure that the Minister of Justice came here the same day when there were a lot of policemen in the street? - Yes, I'm absolutely sure. Because I heard there was a bank robbery... No... the post office robbery... - That's right! - And I thought it was rather strange that he could have some nice time here with another woman... Because you can hear it from here, when the bed... Or what you say... It's not the first time, by the way. - Couldn't we have a drink? I would like to serve you... - Yes, a small glass then. Yes, yes, yes. - I think we should have one. - Yes, thank you. Why does the police inspector ask about that? About the Minister of Justice, why does he ask about that? TURN ON THE TAPE RECORDER While the Minister of Justice was fucking a high-class hooker named Eva Zetterberg, Inspector Hedberg of the Security Service went to the post office and borrowed 395 000. All the documents will be on yout desk at 09:00:00 beep! tomorrow morning. Including a photo of the sweet couple. Regards from...The Kings of the Royal Mounted!!! No, wait! Dahlgren, don't turn it off yet. P. S. Dahlgren... If it is a misconduct to trace murderers, then we can happily live with a couple of reprimands. DS. Please take the shrimpshells out when you'll be leaving or else it will smell like a whorehouse here when I wake up! - OK. The negative that you took with you last night... What the hell are you saying? Didn't you take it with you? Have you eaten anything at all? But damn it Jarnis, that was my fault as well. It I hadn't asked you to take those damned shrimpshells with you... Hey, pull yourself together. This happens even to the best of us. - Right now it feels like it had happened to the worst. Yeah, yeah, don't get hung up about the negative, you have lots of other evidence to show. You surely did not waste you time. If your superior does not complain, why should I... - But he does. - No, it's time for lunch now. Are you coming along? Maybe they serve shrimp omelette! No, chief inspector, everything they told you is a big lie! I never said any of that. Who told you that I said that? Because I never said that! Cheers. Cheers then. - Well, I think... Cheers. Chief inspector! I am sure you can have a glass? This is good portwine! - Yes... - Yes, I should know about that. Cheers. - Mrs. Wahlberg, according to inspector Johansson you stated very clearly that you have seen the person in question here in the stairs on that very day, that is, on Lucia day. - I never said that! I never said that, I said that I had seen him on TV and in magazines, those weekly magazines.... "The Weekly Chronicle", "Daily News" and whatever they are called, this is where I have seen him but I never saw the Minister of Justice at out stairs. Why should he be at our stairs, such a fine man? - She died. - How sad. - She jumped out in the street and the car run over her. Yes, when a dog dies, you mourn her as much as a human. What sort do you have? - Sort? Well... I mean... What breed? I have no dog! No?.. Shouldn't you answer the phone? - No, let it ring. I'd better finish this conversation as soon as possible, whatever this is about. I presume you didn't come here to talk about dogs? Before I start I just want to say one thing: I totally agree with you, the colleague Hedberg shouldn't be among us. He is the client of the penal system, and so does his so called "alibi". I have talked to both Eva Zetterberg and our friend the Minister. I'll be damned! Do you want a dishonorable discharge or what? - She does not remember meeting him at all, at least not on Tuesday the 13th because she spent that day in bed with high fever. And he has no memory of seeing her either. On the other hand, he still remembers that he, on Tuesday morning between 9:45 AM and 1 PM was at a meeting with Kjell Goran Hedberg and two higher friends from the party. - And what's their story? You have fucking talked to them, right? - Yes, I have. They also remember Hedberg. - Are they lawyers? - They are lawyers, and not bad ones either. And then I talked again to all our witnesses against Hedberg. The lady in Zetterberg's stairs... Well, if it had been about portwine labels, maybe... And Mrs. Forsberg, she is also getting not so sure about the case. On the other hand, Vindeln is even more certain than before, so if we are going to prosecute, it will be with Vindeln alone. But then we should better hurry, or there is a great risk that he would drink himself to death. Well. Do I have to continue? - No. It's not necessary. This really sucks. Well, then we go and return to our everyday business. Besides that... I agree with your last statement. This really sucks. - Here is that note. - Thank you. - Can they get to Hedberg now? - No. Unless you don't want me to help them, he's safe. - What if he confesses if they confront him? - No, he will never do that. According to a person I talked to, he will probably forget it all. They have a kind of repression mechanism, those people. Well, you also have one, don't you? ERIK HARALD OLSSON SEEKS KJELL HEDBERG Hey Johan, have you thought of one thing? - What is it? - You remember all the days we waited outside the Minister's villa in Nacka, did you see any dog? - What? - Did you see any dog at all? And Hedberg's present - the dog leash. Damn, Johan, the Minister doesn't have a dog! The present wasn't for him! But I saw Hedberg entering the room! - Yes, but you weren't there when he came out. All we know that he didn't have the present when he came in the street again. He must have left it for someone else, some messenger girl who didn't fall for the usual two drinks. - Are you sane? Are you starting to doubt now? - No, I am not. I only say that the connection between Hedberg and the Minister of Justice that we saw it didn't exist. You don't give a dog leash to someone who doesn't have a dog! And another thing about the fact that he didn't wait for the green light. - Yes? - He was in a hurry, damn it! - Are you finished now? - Yes. - That's good, because I was afraid that you would start to claim that the Minister of Justice never visited Eva Zeterberg that night, when I was freezing my butt off in the stairs. Or that I never took that photo which you managed to put with the shrimpshells, which you threw... Well, I'm sorry. - No, really Johan, it's no problem. Really Johan, it's no problem. Those damned shrimpshells are on me. I've gotten over them now. But I think it's a shame that you start to think with your ass when you get under the strain. It's not your style. A compliment, the last thing. A damned fine compliment. POST OFFICE ROBBERY NO RESULT OF INVESTIGATION CLOSED CASES 1983 DRAFT SAK BUDGET 85/86 321 million. We have a hell of a financial situation, you must understand that. You are not the only one who wants the piece of this pie, I tell you. 321 million to SAK... Yes, 321 million is OK, I think, we can handle that. There was a thing here... You have an unspecified entry here: in-service training with foreign contacts 2 650 000, what the hell is that about? We've got an agreement with the Germans. We send 20 men to their GSG-9, a three month in-service training. GSG-9? Isn't that their terrorist commandos. You must realize that this is damned delicate! Aren't they the ones who usually storm airports? - Well, we need this, and it won't leak. The men we are sending there are reliable. The leader of the group will be the one Hedberg. I think you know him. I have the greatest confidence in Hedberg. Well, I guess we'll have to save on daycare centers... What the hell are your options?
