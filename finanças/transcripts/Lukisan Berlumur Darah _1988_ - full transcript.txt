I will kill you. Bastard! Barbaric! Bastard! Soma! - Yunan! Help me! - It's you, Yunan. Even though she has become the mistress of that Dutch man, you still love her. Stop it! Come and fight me if you want to die. Bastard! Don't! Don't! You have killed Mr. Rust and stole his possession that you like! But don't touch me. No! No! Let go! No! Let go! No! Move. Yunan! Don't just sit there. Help me bury these scumbags. But you must keep this to yourself. Hurry up! Come on. This house is officially yours now. And don't forget our agreement. - Because, as a broker, I'm responsible... - It's alright. Don't worry. - I just want to have a house. - Yeah. And I'm grateful I can buy this house at a reasonable price. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'm leaving now, Ma'am. - Yes. The other furniture has arrived. Unload the truck. Yes, Ma'am. Honey. That banyan tree. I don't like it. It gives me an eerie feeling, like in a cemetery. Tell them to cut it down tomorrow. Yeah. Be careful. You can't be too tired. You'll get sick. Dust. We could be buried in dust. Why did you buy this old house anyway? It's the price. We won't get a better price for a house this big. In town, we could probably only afford two years rent in a big house like this. Take that to the back. Yes, put it there. Near the kitchen. - Pur, give me a hand. - Sure. You moved here right away? Hi, Mr. Madrais. Yes, we move here today. Our plan is to go to your house tonight. No problem. Whoever has time should come and visit first. What's important is people in this neighborhood should know each other. Hana. Hana. Hana. - Excuse me. - Sure. Hana, come with me for a minute. Sir. He is our Neighborhood Association chairman. - Hana. - Madrais. - Could you... - Excuse me, Sir. - Come with me. - What is it? Please excuse me. - Come here. - What? Look. It's such a great painting, but it's been abandoned here. Beautiful. Especially the smile. Just as amazing as Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Impressive, but unfortunately... - What? - It's ripped all over the place. And the look in her eyes is so piercing. As if she's holding a grudge. That's what I admire about this painting. Her eyes are so alive, beautiful and impressive. Those are the eyes of a witch. Look at that. The artist name. It's like a Dutch name. Sir, should I put it in the front? - Yes, just put it there. - Okay. Just leave the painting there. You can organize the people to decorate the living room. Here you go. Thank you. You're not scared to live in a big house like this, just the two of you? - Why? - It's looks spooky here. - Nonsense. - Thank you. Is there anything I can do for you? Oh, right. Can you do me a favor? Do you know anyone I can hire to cut down that tree? - Cut it down? - Yes. Nobody would even go past that tree after dark. - Unless it's really urgent. - Why? Afraid of ghosts? In this modern era of Star Wars, people are still afraid of ghosts? Never mind then. Well, they're just villagers. But if you want to get rid of that tree, I can tell Hanafi to do that. Who is Hanafi? A pious man. He's a diligent worshiper. Rumor has it that he possesses the power to conquer the evil spirit. Never mind. I'll find someone to cut down that tree myself. My wife doesn't like to see a big tree like that in front of the house. She said it looked haunted. Hana. Did you make me coffee? Hana? Han... Hana. Hana. Honey, you scared me. When will you have time to make me coffee... if your always working on that painting? Look. Her neck is ripped, her chest cut open. Don't you feel sorry to see a beautiful lady like this suffer? What's the matter? That painting. It's hurting you. Yes, it's hurting me. I will get rid of it tomorrow. Burn it if you have to. - Peace be upon you. - Yeah... Well, what's this? Looks like you slept very well last night. Because I was very tired. Well, you know. The district chief and the police are here. Police? - What do they want? - You don't know? The banyan tree fell down last night. Fell? When? Last night, during the storm. Wow. You must have slept really well, considering you didn't hear anything. Yeah. Come on. Hold on. I don't think you should tell your wife about it. Because they found a skeleton buried beneath the roots. That's why the police are here. - Warso, tell them to move away. - Yes, Sir. Come on, move. Agus, this is the district chief. - This is detective Susilo. - Susilo. This is Misdar. And that's Suwarso. Agus is a high school teacher. He just moved here yesterday. Do you know where the previous owner of the house lives now? I don't know. I bought the house from an agent. And the last occupant gave the agent full legal authority to take care of the transaction. - Or maybe you know, Mr. Madrais? - That's the problem. That man is Yunan. But he never stays in one place for very long. I heard that he was a good friend of my father. But, I'm not sure. He's a mysterious guy. He doesn't mingle with people here. And since I became the chief here, he's never shown up for a meeting. Put that away. I told you, she couldn't stand to see it. She faints a lot lately. Maybe it's the baby. - Huh? She's pregnant? No wonder. - Give me a hand. - Put the bones in the bag. - Make way. Tell Mr. Madrais, the District Chief and I will go now. Warso, tell the people to leave. Move... Move... Children have to go to school. Hana. What happened? You fainted. No, I didn't. I'm fine. - It's alright now. You can leave us. - Okay. It's crazy. - How is it going? - Our cleavers can't chop it down. I knew it all along. - Tell Hanafi to come here. - Salim is already on the way to get him. We need a big saw. Who can borrow or rent one from a hardware store? There's no guarantee that a big saw will work. Something mystical lives in this tree. Right? - Yes. - Nonsense. It won't hurt to listen to what people here say. Even the strangest things can happen here. - Peace be upon you. - And unto you peace. - Peace be upon you. - And unto you peace. We can't cut down this tree. Please help. Okay. In the name of Allah, the most merciful and gracious. Praise be to the Lord. Cut this tree and say Basmalah. In the name of Allah, the most merciful and gracious. - That's Agus. - Right. There's more to the world than what we can see. There's a spirit world that lies beneath our world. I know you're an educated man. But I don't think you can underestimate the superstitious things here. A human consists of physical and spiritual elements. When a human dies, the body will decay, but our spirit will not die... as we are judged for what we have done in our life. And the human spirit who has led a sinful life, will be allied with the evil spirit. And that's what we can call Satan. Be careful. That house doesn't seem suitable for a young family like yours. - It's not clean. - Thank you. Remember. No human can defeat the mystical power of the evil spirit. Only God is almighty. What happened? - Humans are classified as mammals. - She fell. - Bring her to the office. - Yes, Miss. They first emerged as primates. And then they evolved into animals classified as primate ordo. The animals in primate ordo kept evolving into trio pithecus. The divergent line of evolution occurred in that evolution process. "Our new teacher is handsome." One side evolved toward pongidae familia. Which finally evolved... to these four types of apes. Gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee. Another line of evolution went towards hominidae... which ended up evolving into humans like this... after going through the phase of pithecanthropus and homo sapiens. - Desy, come forward. - Yes. Coffee. Man, it's coffee time. - What's wrong with you? - I'm sorry. Sorry you say? You should watch where you're going. Hana. They said you fainted. I saw blood. Blood everywhere. Her chest was covered in blood. Her chest covered in blood! Look at this! You have a fever. See? No blood. Not even in this painting. The stitches in the neck have broken apart due to the dry paint. Or because it was slammed to the floor last night. Blood! Everything's covered in blood! I'm scared! We are standing in a puddle of blood. Hana! Blood! - Everything's covered in blood! - Hana! Agus, why are you using violence? Because you keep talking nonsense. You only care about that painting. Don't you have better things to do? Have you cooked for your husband? I should just burn that damn painting. Please forgive me. I don't know why I feel so volatile lately. And my body always feels weak. Get some rest. Take good care of the baby. Lim, pour more oil on. Nobody would want this wood. They would rather buy firewood... than use this banyan wood. It is superstitious. But what can we do about it? - It's alright then. - If we burn the wood everyday... eventually all the wood will be gone. Are you doing the night patrol, Jat? Where's your dad? He's sick. I'm replacing him tonight. Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Put out the fire! It's hot! Put it out! Please put the fire out. My wife is suffering from the heat. The wind is going to the house. Put it out. Hurry. Hana. Han... Hot! Hana! Hot! Hana. Hana. Han... It's hot. Hot. Turn off the light. Turn it off. Do you hear me? Han... Hana. - It's very cold tonight. - Maybe it's going to rain soon. Have you hit the alarm for people here? - Stop talking. - Oh, right. I forgot. You're asleep on the job. Honey! Honey! Bastard! - Agus, I've killed him. - No, it wasn't you. It wasn't you who killed him. You were possessed by an evil spirit. - I'm scared. - Stay calm. What we have to do now is get rid of the body. We have to bury him. I don't want to go to jail. I don't want the people in this village punish me. - Yes. - Think about our baby. - Don't let our baby be born in prison. - Yes. Come on. Help me, hurry. - Hana! - Help! Hana! - Hana! Help! - Honey. Wake up! What did you dream about? You acted as if you were drowning. I was drowning in the most disgusting hole. No. What are you looking for? Blood. This room was filled with blood. Blood? Hana, I had a terrible nightmare. Honey. - What kind of nightmare? - No... No. I'm sorry, Honey. I keep troubling you... and it even disturbed your dreams. I think something is wrong with this house. Actually, I don't believe in superstitious stuff like that. I'm sure the ventilation system in this house is awful, and it's affecting our nervous system. The sun is up. You could be late. You're a new teacher there. You shouldn't be late. Right. Mr. Agus. One moment please. - How's everything? How are you? - I'm fine. The skeleton we found that day was female. And it shows evidence of murder. And it's being examined in the lab. We're still trying to find the address of the man who used to own your house. Unfortunately, I don't think I can help. It didn't cross my mind to get Mr. Yunan's address. It's alright. Besides, who would've thought things would get complicated? Right? According to the police investigation, the skeleton under the banyan tree was a female, a murder victim. - Really? - Yes. But, you don't seem to care. It has nothing to do with us. You're not scared? - Why should I be? - You kept that painting. Who knows? That woman in the painting could be the murder victim. Oh, Honey. That painting is an inanimate object. It can't come back to life for any revenge that she took with her to the grave. You've got a point there. You mentioned revenge. What did you mean by that? People who die like that will come back for revenge. Yeah. Revenge. Enough. Don't talk about it anymore. I'm sick of it. Hana. Finish your meal. I'll take a shower now. One day I will burn you. Han... Hana. Hana. Blood!! That tub is filled with blood! - Hana! - Blood. That tub is filled with blood. Hana, it's only in your mind. See? No blood. But you've kept the water running when it's already full. There's a dead body in the tub. Nothing in here. There's no dead body here. Nothing. See? See? You just dropped your towel in there. Come on. - Be careful. - The floor is slippery. I fell there many times, as if it tried to kill me. Replace the tiles. - I asked you to do it yesterday. - Okay. I'll do it tomorrow. I'll change it to marble if I have to. I didn't ask you to change it to marble. Cement will do. Alright, but now your feet need a massage. That painting again. I didn't ask you to carry me like this anyway! I just want the right to love that painting! And I won't let anyone take it away from me! And for that painting, you neglect your duty to take care of your husband. How many times have I made my own coffee because you were busy with that lousy painting! Watch your language! I don't like the way you're talking. Look at me! And look at who you really are! - I will burn this painting! - Don't you dare! - Once you start the fire, you will die. - Hana. - And I will kill you! - Hana. Don't glare at me like that. I'm scared. Because you... Please forgive me. I don't know why... I get upset without reason lately. Come on. And about the bathroom floor, it can wait. - We can do it when you have the budget. - It's alright. I've been meaning to change it anyway. I tripped there twice myself. Come on. I'll massage your feet. No wonder the closet doesn't work too well. There's another closet below this closet. Maybe there's another layer of tiles below this one. How can that be possible? Of course it's possible. Maybe the previous owner... What's his name? Oh, right. Yunan. Maybe he buried his treasure here. We can be rich. If you really found the treasure, what would you do? We'd sell it. Sell the house, buy a new one and move from here. No. Why should we move? This house is quite comfortable. And this house has a pretty unique style too. I think it's time to make you coffee. Agree? You really are a wise wife. It really is the house of the devils. Hana, you don't need to bring the coffee here. Alright. I told you not to bring it here. We have to move from here immediately. This house even smells like blood. Those bones probably belong to a murder victim, just like the bones they found under the banyan tree. I have to report it to the police, right away. No! Why not? Police have to investigate this case. You want this house swarming with people? People will make nasty comments, and it will keep ruining our life. So what should I do then? Bury that skeleton again, and cover it with concrete. Do it! What are you waiting for? Insane! Damned house! That's why nobody wanted it before I bought it. Damn! You just can't believe anything people say. I've never even been to a brothel. It's slander. At first, I didn't believe it either. But after seeing you in Nur's house, I was convinced that what people were saying was right. - That I fool around with women? - That you're a playboy. Don't be mad. I still love you, no matter what people say about you. Why don't you say something? Do you even like me? I like beauty. Let's go. The female skeleton, under the banyan tree, must be related... Bastard! Coward! My poor wife. Her mind is always troubled. So you're the mastermind behind it! You told Ulun and Soma to rape me! It's a lie! It's slander! Listen to me, Juarsih. I fell in love with you before you became that Dutch man's mistress. - But... - You have no courage, because you're just a lackey. Then you sent Ulun and Soma to kill my husband and rape me! - Yunan, you bastard! - No, Juarsih! My love is sincere. And I've kept everything to myself so far. I helped you bury Ulun under the bathroom tiles, and then bury Soma under the closet! I killed them with my own hands! I pee on their bodies everyday. But you're the one behind it. You're the one who sent them to rape me! No, Juarsih! How many times have I told you? Soma and Ulun were scumbags. They killed your husband, Mr. Rust, because they planned to rob him. You see this? See this! They hurt me too, didn't they? But why didn't you do anything when they raped me? Why? I was afraid. I couldn't defeat them. Bastard! Coward! Juarsih! I knew your cunning plan. You let them rape me to tarnish my dignity, so I'd stoop to your level, a lackey! Am I right? You're obsessed with me! - Answer me! Answer me! - Don't do it! No matter what you accuse me of, you are my wife! No, Juarsih! I'm your husband! I'm your husband! I will kill you and bury you, like you did to them! Juarsih! No matter how long it takes, I will get my revenge on you. Evil witch! You've killed Soma and Ulun! But it's still not enough for you! I'm sick and tired of all your bitchiness. Evil witch! Help me. You must avenge my death. - Why me? - Because you are a woman like me. - Is that the only reason? - Because you are pregnant. Just like me. - I am pregnant too. - Okay. Kill each and every one who hurts me. - Every single one of their descendants. - Okay. May your soul rest in peace, in the afterlife... under this banyan tree. What's wrong? What happened? I... I... Hana. - Ningrum! Don't forget the book. - I won't. Bye. Dwi! Wait for me! Thanks, Jat. Are we still going to Mahmud's place tonight? No. Ningrum will study at home. You lied to me. Last night you said you were going to do your homework at Tuti's place. But you went to the movies instead. The electricity went off last night. It will happen again tonight at Mahmud's. Ningrum, get inside. I'm leaving now, Sir. So you still go out with Jajat, huh? Ask your mom what kind of family that silly boy belongs to. His father is a swindler. His grandfather was a womanizer. Jajat is my friend, my only friend. Friends for now, but eventually you will fall head over heels in love with him. A man like Jajat will do anything to get what he wants. See? I'm warning you, but you're upset. You'd be sorry if he got you pregnant. Spoiled kid! Jajat is the descendant of a womanizer. He will end up like his ancestor! If you don't believe me ask Amir. He knows what he does in the village square every night. Enough, Dad! It's a sin to insult other people. Prostitution! He's just a kid, but he hangs out with prostitutes! - Enough! Mom. - You see that? That's enough. Stop yelling. People can hear you. It's always like this. It's alright. Don't worry about it. What's important is to stay close to God. Get closer to God by worshiping and praying. Do the prayer or salah. Only prayer will give your soul the strength to fight evil. Remember. No power can save us... without God's will. I am learning to perform salah and prayers now. But it's hard to convince my wife to do it too. Take it slow. It must come from the heart. Thank you. Don't worry. I will help you with my prayer from afar. - Alright then. Peace be upon you. - And unto you peace. Hana... You are me. You are my hands. Yes. You are my revenge. Yes. Hot! Hot. Do it. Hana. Do it. Looking for something, Honey? I feel so relieved after performing my prayers. When will you start to do it? Alright, Honey. We'll perform prayer together one day. Where's my coffee? On your work desk. You're still going there, Jajat? Well, you were young once, Dad. - Honey... - Hold on. Jajat, you know what Ningrum's parents think about me... and you know what people here also think, right? - Enough. - Wait, Honey. Enough. - Good evening, Sir. - Evening. - Is Ningrum home? - Why? She borrowed my book. I just want to see her for a minute. She's sleeping now. She's been sleeping since this afternoon. You can see her tomorrow morning at school. Tacky! Old fashioned! His daughter was sleeping he says? Mrs. Agus. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. - Waiting for me? - Yes. Where's Mr. Agus? That man loves his books more than he loves his wife. Walk me home, will you? Come on. Why are we going this way? It's alright. We can go this way too. Now it's time for you to repent for Ulun, your grandfather. Hana. Han... Hana, wake up... Why did you let me sleep here? I was about to ask you, why did you sleep here? I don't know. I'm feeling worse now. My mind is getting more messed up. Get up. I woke up late this morning too. I'm late for Subuh prayer. I'd rather miss something else, than miss prayer. When will you learn to do the prayer? Someday. Prayer can ease your mind and keep you away from the evil thoughts. - No! - What happened? - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. What's going on? Why are they still outside? - It's Jatmiko. - Yes, what about him? You haven't heard? Jatmiko was found dead this morning in the bushes. It looks like he was murdered. - Murdered? - No! No. No. No. No. No. Please, stay calm. You're home late today. I went to a funeral. - Funeral? - Yes. Who died? One of my students, Sujatmiko. He was known as the unruly kid, and a playboy. But according to his friends, he's kind of a good boy. And he didn't have any enemies. You mean Sujatmiko... He did night patrol, to cover for his father, quite often. He was the one... who gathered his friends to burn down the banyan tree. Based on the initial investigation, Mr. Susilo said the murderer was a woman. How does he know that? They found lace panties near the body. What's confusing, is the panties were ripped. Could he have been murdered when he tried to rape the woman? And the wound in Jajat's body is so similar to the one in my dream. The most horrifying dream I've ever had. What dream are you talking about? I'm scared. The incidents are similar, but with different victims. What's wrong? You make me confused. I can never forget that dream. I will never be able to forget it. I feel like it will happen to me, in this house. Just like in my dream, Jajat's chest was ripped open. And... No. Impossible. What do you mean? You make me more nervous. No! You don't need to know that. - You will not... - Tell me. It's just a dream. It won't affect me, trust me. The murderer in my dream was you. Me? I killed Sujatmiko? No, not him, but another man in my dream. You scared me. I'm glad it was just a dream. A dream is not real, right? I don't think it's just a dream. I hope it's a good sign. Just like the baby inside me that's kicking me now. It's a bad sign. My heart says it's a bad sign. - Honey. - Hana. This room is always locked. Weird. The people who can get in here and fool us are really sneaky. Maybe it's chicken's blood. I sent the blood sample to the lab to be examined. But based on my experience, this smell is the smell of human's blood. Maybe we should get help from a shaman or something? The skeleton we discovered was weird in the first place. Yes. Yunan, the previous owner of that house, he's also strange. We still can't trace him. And we need his statement to investigate this skeleton. He's also mysterious. Romana went across the river, but I was the one who fell to the water. - Good evening. - Good evening, Sir. - Please have a seat. - It's alright. Carry on. But stay alert, and don't forget to take turns in making rounds every hour. Sure. We don't want the incident with Jatmiko to happen again here. We have to be cautious and not let anyone become the next victim. Very good. We need everyone to have that kind of awareness. Yes, sir. Excuse me now. I will oversee the south. - You want us to escort you? - I'm fine. - Want some roast cassava? - No, thanks. Let's roast some more cassava. Hana... Hana... Hana... Hana... Tonight my revenge must be fulfilled. It must. Do it. Do it. Do it, Hana. Yes. Tonight your revenge must be fulfilled. I will do it. Mrs. Agus. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you. Are you doing night patrol? My responsibility is to make rounds, even though it's not my turn. What are you doing alone out here, at this hour? Where's your husband? Once he's asleep, he sleeps like the dead. He wouldn't care about his wife. Don't you feel cold standing outside like that? Come inside. Come on. Mr. Madrais. Now it's time for you to pay for the sins of your father, Soma! What do you mean? No! Hana. Hana. My goodness. Hana! Hana. Oh, my God. Hana! What have I done? What's happening here? How can this be happening? Madrais! Oh, God. Barbaric! Inhumane! It wasn't me who did it! It wasn't me! It wasn't you? Look at your hands, your face! Come here! Come here! Look! Look! It's her! She told me to do it. It's her! Evil witch! What have we done to you to deserve this? What? Why are you destroying our marriage? Why? People will come here any minute with crowbars and cleavers, and we will be punished. And then the police will throw us in the cold and stuffy jail. Honey. I don't mind going to jail if I'm guilty. But, I swear to God, I don't remember doing it. I don't remember doing it. Yeah... We have to get out of this house immediately. Clean yourself up, hurry. This house really is damned. I don't want to leave this house! This is my house! - I don't want to leave. This is my house! - Do you know what you're saying? I told you not to touch this damn painting anymore! Hana? Hana. Pull yourself together. Say God's name. God, please protect my innocent wife. Set her free from the demonic power. Hana. Hana! I'm your husband! God, please protect my wife. Juarsih! The revenge you're seeking has gone too far. You want to kill an innocent man like him too? He's my husband who killed me! No. He is the husband of a woman that you're possessing now. I was the one who killed you. - Is that you, Yunan? - Yes. Get the prayer beads, hurry! No! Your wife is possessed by an evil spirit! Help me with prayer! Trust me! He said he would go to the south. - We must report it. - Hurry. - Get the prayer beads! - Yes! Put it around her neck! Calm down. Hana, wake up. - What's happening? - You fainted. Come on. - Who is he? - Yunan, the previous owner of this house. Praise be to God. My prayer has helped you. What should we do to cast that evil spirit out? - Only your wife can destroy the demon. - Why me? Because you are the weakest here. That's why Juarsih's evil spirit could posses you. What do you mean? Your wife has to strengthen herself with the words of God. - How are you? Is everyone alright? - Praise be to God. Don't. It's useless. She's a demonic spirit, not a human. Hana. Burn it. Burn it. Say "Bismillah" before doing anything. Come on, say it. In the name of Allah, the most merciful and gracious. Praise be to God. The curse on this house has been lifted now. Yes, but the law still has to be enforced. Honey. Satan said, "O my Lord! Because thou hast put me in the wrong, I will do wrong to them on the earth, and I will put them all in the wrong. Except thy servants among them, sincere and purified by thy grace." Satan will never give up. He will come again anytime, to lead humans away from God's path. And Satan can't be defeated, except by the devoted amongst your worshippers.
