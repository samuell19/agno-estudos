Cyrus! I'm alright dear! Hi Ritu... Woke up? I reached the conference meet, It will start now. It's our first wedding anniversary! It kills me not being there... Anyways, I miss you so much! I'll be back tomorrow. If you are bored being alone, ask Bhavana or Abi to stay over. Then... Don't forget your tablets... have food, take rest... and avoid mood swings! Ask our baby to behave nice... and tell her Dad will narrate her fairy tales! Okay? You got check-up at 3:30 today... don't forget. Drive carefully Ritu! Okay? Hey! I miss you! Shruthi! Please come. Move aside, make some space. What will I do now? Why did you attempt suicide? What will happen to us? Move aside... Near the cold sea... several Penguins are living. Among them, there's a Penguin... that was having fun with its family and friends. The penguin then delivered a small penguin. The small penguin is now the apple of her eye! One day, the Penguin set out farther... to bring fish for the nestling. When she was bringing all the fish back... down pour started with heavy thunders, and the mother Penguin got injured severely. Even then, she managed to walk back just to see her little nestling, but... the little penguin is caught in the sea alone and crying aloud! Mother Penguin got tensed! The mother penguin can't understand how the little one got into the sea. But, to save her nestling... she steps on the water despite her injuries. But, she doesn't know that there are crocodiles... ...and piranhas in the sea that are waiting to eat her! Rhythm! Ajju, I will be back in a minute. What's up Raghu? Bhavana... Bahavana's father is no more. Kathir, take it. Please go inside. His heart stopped while sleeping. Come inside. [Bhavana Mom] Please look at me [Bhavana Mom] What am I going to do? [Bhavana Mom] I can't bear the loss [Bhavana's Mother] Rhythm is here, you are always fond of her, [Bhavana's mother] please wake up and see her We are all with you. Don't think that you are alone. You need to... console your Mom. Bhavana... Bhavana... Give her some space. Where's Ajay? He's with Kathir. Kathir, Is Ajay there? Is Ajay there? He came with you inside. What? But... he was there! Hey... Just now he came with you inside! oh no... Raghu... Ajay is Wait..wait! Don't get tensed Everyone's grieving, search him without disturbing others. Ajay! Sorry... Sorry [Bhavana Mom]What will we do without you! Please get up! What happened? He's not here Raghu. Did you see a boy around here wearing a white T-shirt? Ajay... - Did you find him? - Ajay is missing - What happened? - Ajay is missing. Ajay is missing... - Calm down. - A few minutes back I saw him. - Don't get tensed, we will search - Don't cry, just don't cry He should be here. What happened? A small kid is missing, did you saw him here? Hey, A kid is missing, Search him guys. He's a small kid, can you check on the backyard? - Sir, can you check outside? - Sure sir. - Please call me if you find him. - Okay sir. - Where? - He's not here. Abi, search him there. [Bhavana Mom] What happened? [Woman] Rhythm's kid is missing [Bhavana's mom] Oh God! Rhythm's son is missing! [Crowd] He's not inside the house - What happened? - Bhavana... Ajju is missing. Don't panic, I will check around. He's nowhere to be found Raghu! Don't say 'he is missing'...You lost him! You are responsible for this. If we don't find him... I searched backside as well - Isn't he inside? - No, he isn't... Ajay is here. Ajay Sorry Ajju. I won't leave you again. Won't leave you again. He's just scared! Rhythm Rhythm, you are next. Where are you running away baby? Don't roam this side. There is a ghost behind these walls. It will bite you! Okay? Don't go near the wall. We can hear heartbeats... but the baby is not moving. Is that a problem? Baby wake... wake Wake Wake baby! Looks like baby is scared. You are already scared of insects... why did you go there? I didn't expect that Doctor. If the blood pressure shoots up again, it will impact oxygen supply for the fetus. It will put your life also in danger. Doctor... I'm okay if anything bad happens to me... ...but nothing should happen to my child. Rhythm, your life is as important as your child's life. Anyways... Just be cautious for the next two months, okay? Doctor? Please don't tell Goutham. He'll get tensed. Sorry dear, I've already informed him! Rhythm, I know how important this child is for you. So, Personally let me suggest you to... avoid everything that reminds your past. Especially, Don't go near the Lake. Hi Aunty! Hi, Pavi! Ajay is not playing with me! Oh... Is it? I will ask Ajay to play with you for two more hours. - Is that okay dear? - No Aunty! But why dear? We heard a whistling sound from the forest... Ajay went into the forest following it. - When did this happened? - Some time back. But, who was there? Charlie Chaplin Uncle, with an umbrella was standing there... and Ajay never returned! AJAY! AJAY! AJAY! AJAY... Rhythm... Let's search him. AJAY! Sir... - What is it? - Come here and see this. [Doctor] She assumes insects are a metaphor for death, hence she fears them. Doctor, does this mean she can't go outside? [Doctor] No. She can move around. Any treatment? [Doctor] Not needed, She will be fine if she doesn't recall those moments. You got any info about Ajay? We are still searching. Sir, It's been a year... poor kid. Every morning he seeks me when he wakes up. He can't bear hunger, he'll start crying. Don't know where he's suffering or... what he's doing. Sir... No Raghu... No... I will not come... Please... No Raghu... No way... Please Raghu... Raghu... Raghu... Please no... I will not come... I am sorry. I think Ajay is dead. Nothing happened to him... and nothing will happen. Nothing happened to him. Nothing happened to him... If I was in your place, I would thought about killing myself. But, If you are able to cross this phase, then life will bring you surprises... and for that, you should live. Even in the orphanage, we haven't seen you this broken. You were an inspiration for everyone in the school. So, what happened to you now? Everyone has their struggles dear, Our Bhavana, she was madly in love with a guy in college... But he dumped her casually for another girl. Did she end her life there? she survived. Kathir and I, married for seven years and we don't have a child... But still, we didn't lose hope. Look, this is not your end... ...you have lot more to experience in life. Sir... Sir... What happened? He is... coming back. I don't get you Sir, let me call an Ambulance. I saw him... Whom did you see? That... missing kid... I saw the kid as well. Missing kid? Sir, which kid did you saw? Which kid, sir? Sir, Which kid did you see? Please tell me sir. Sir... Which kid? RUN! I took a picture of him... Go Go... GO... - Sir... - Yes Madam? - There... - What happened madam? Accident... A guy... fell from the top. Hey, check if anyone's there in the car No Sir... someone in blood... was dragging him... Sir, no one's here. Where Madam? Save him... near Lake. Okay, you are safe now, calm down. Sir, bring her some sweet water. - Get the bike - Yes sir! you stay here Madam, we will check it out. It's cold here, come and sit inside madam. I want to talk to the Inspector. Yeah, tell me Rhythm. Sir, a stranger near the lake told me that he saw the kid. Which kid? He was dragged away before revealing details... ...it should be Ajay, sir. - Please Sir, do something. - Rhythm! - start the jeep. - Please Sir.. Please Please Sir, The guy who came should be the kidnapper. He should be the one who kidnapped Ajay. I don't think it's Ajay - No sir, he said... he saw a kid... - Rhythm! It can't be Ajay Another child is missing! You stay there, I will come. Dispatch a search team to West Lake. Urgent! There might be a connection between the missing child and the Lake. Any team near the Lake, Respond now. Why are you going alone in these odd hours madam? Who is missing? Anjana, an eight year old kid. We are searching for her since dawn. Six children in these six years! We are not sure either this is missing case or kidnapping case. Atleast this child should be found. Inspector will be here now, Don't worry madam. Sir... anybody there? Are you able to hear? We are calling from Lake area We found a flower bouquet with the caption "REST IN PEACE" Sir... it's full of flesh... and lots of flies here. Hey... Don't touch that! Madam...! Sir, that Lady is driving back to the Lake. Goutham... Ritu, I'm back, On my way to the checkpost along with the Inspector. Goutham, I'm going to Lake. I think the same guy kidnapped our Ajay Ritu, Don't be adamant, just go back to check-post. No Goutham... I'm sure Ajay is with... Ajay... Open your mouth! Did he talk? No doctor. Okay. I'm so happy dear. Ajay! How are you? Do you remember me? He's got... touch discomfort. He didn't allow any nurses to touch him. He's very disturbed. I've gone through all the reports. We observed him for the past 18 hours... but he hasn't uttered a word. - Nurse - Yes Doctor? - Prepare the reports for Police. - Sure Did Ajay said anything? She's Anjana's mother. Doctor... is still checking him Can you please ask Ajay... whether he saw my daughter? Madam, We are enquiring, please hold yourself. But Sir... she's just a kid, she can't even bear hunger - When she wakes up... - When he wakes up, he seeks me first. He can't bear hunger, he will start crying. We will find her soon, Madam. Let's go Madam. Just one minute... This... is my daughter. She was wearing the same dress when she went missing. Can you please ask about her whereabouts? My daughter... will be found soon. It's a blessing that you got the kid back. When you ignored me and went to the lake... I really got mad at you for first time. But... when you stood there with your son, I was stunned by your belief all these years! I'm so happy for you Rhythm. We have to inform Ajay's father as well. Ajay? - Hi Raghu - Hi Ajay... Is that Ajay? Yes, the DNA matches. Why is he like this? He got thinning in the right ankle bone. I think his legs were tied to a rusted chain. He's not salivating at all... because his saliva glands are dry. I'm not sure what he was eating... and that could be the reason for his tooth stains. Also, he should have been stayed in a dark room... that's why his skin is pale. His nails got lots of sawdust... and I sent those samples to you Inspector. Okay Doctor. Ajay's body got lots of scratches and scars... He has suffered a lot. Since his arrival, he hasn't spoken a single word... not even a sound... and didn't even shed a tear! Importantly... he's not scared at all! The guy who did this to him didn't even consider his tender age, so... He's definitely a ruthless monster. All Ajay needs now is... good food and lots of care. Leave him alone for a few days. Give him space. He will take time to socialize. Who tortured Ajay this way? To find that, either we need to find Anjana or... Ajay should start talking. - Inspector - Yes Doctor? Can you collect the reports now? Okay Doctor. Goutham, please come. Don't get confused, we got him back! Hey, I'm so happy dear. Kathir will be delighted to hear it. Hey, let this be a surprise to Kathir. I will go and prepare room for Ajay Let us help you. Bhavana, you take Rhythm to Ajay's ward and wait there, I will give a call when we are done. Fine, let me go and settle the bill. You should have cared more when he was alive! Now with your grief you are killing me! You should have been careful in watching him! You are not worthy to raise a kid! Let's split Rhythm! Let's end this here. How long are you pregnant? Seventh month. How many kids you have? No, I'm not married yet. Sorry... Sorry... for everything. Raghu... Who is going to take care of Ajay? Rhythm will take care. Okay fine, I will complete the procedure accordingly. Ajay should be with you... Always! What a beautiful weather today and hope it extends tomorrow to welcome Mystic Carnival! We expect people from 6 to 60 year old for this annual festival! It will be full of smiling and happy faces, so get ready lots of fun and excitement folks!

Yes Doctor, this is what I see in my dreams. But, how did he sketch that? His random sketches just matched your dream, that's it. Don't take it too seriously. But, when I see this... it looks like reflections of his thoughts. I think he's trying to communicate through these sketches. So... What do you think about this sketch? A guy standing near the window! He should have imagined that... the Kidnapper is stalking him, Or... the kidnapper might have paid him a visit. I can only give further inputs only if he sketches again. Why don't you ask him about this? They tried to make him speak... but he's non-responsive. I told you that he sang last night. Ajju! Can you sing the rhymes again? Ajju... Please. Everybody assumes that your mom is lying... Ajju... Look here... Ajju..Look at your mom... Relax... Relax dear! Let's do one thing, If he sings again... you record it and we will all get a clarity. At this time... Don't strain yourself with unwarranted thoughts. You need to rest! See you. Ajay, bye! Okay Rhythm, I will drop him off. Yes, Raghu? I'm leaving town tomorrow. I thought of meetingAjay before I leave. You can come home. No..No... I feel uncomfortable to come home... so, shall we meet outside? Okay, Where? Ajju, where were you all these days? How you got all these scars? Anjana is also pitiful like you. She could be suffering somewhere, Who did this to you dear? Thank you! He should have imagined that the kidnapper is stalking him Or the kidnapper might have paid him a visit. Ajju! Ajju... is there anyone behind me? Is it the Kidnapper? Ajay, come. There was a guy in that table... - There? - Yeah, did you see him? I didn't notice madam. - Any orders placed from that table? - No madam. - Is there any other exit here? - No madam. Cyrus, Stay! I asked you to wait inside! What are you doing here? Raghu! The Kidnapper is in this crowd. Here? Let's go somewhere and discuss, come. Raghu! Ajay! Rhythm, what happened? Ajay is gone! He took off into the crowd Ajay! AJAY! Ajay... AJAY... AJAY! Ajay... Cyrus... Ajay! CYRUS... Ajay... Ajay I'm here... You are safe! Ajju... Ajju What's happening here? Why did he run away from you? The kidnapper came by the house yesterday. He followed us here as well, that's why Ajay ran. I thought Ajay is safe! Why would the kidnapper come again? Cover... where's the cover. What's it Raghu? Goutham photos. Where is Goutham now? - Tell me - He's at home. Call him... no time to think, just call him. What if it was Goutham? Why would he leave his own pictures on the cover? Also, If that's the case, Ajay would have reacted seeing Goutham. You can't conclude anything from these pictures. I know him well, It can't be him. The kidnapper is somewhere else. Take me to the place where you found Ajay... We will find all the answers there! Do you want to know who kidnapped? Ajay will show you now. He is agitated. Please stop this Raghu. Don't push him. He's not scared to go inside, but... ...he's not ready to snitch. Ajay was with us for two years only, but with kidnapper, he spent... SIX YEARS! Naturally, he's inclined towards Kidnapper. He won't reveal, even if the kidnapper is... in front of him What if... Ajay prefers to stay with Kidnapper? No..No way... Whomsoever he spent time with, he's my son! You are blinded by love, he's my son as well. But, think practically... All these are assumptions! Fine... Did we find Ajay? No, he came on his own. What if he got other plans? Champ... put that down. Put that DOWN! JUST DROP IT! Relax... Relax We are at your home only I tried reaching Goutham, but no response. That's why I called Ambulance and accompanied you. Ajay? He's inside. I don't know whom to suspect! but, I'm sure his childhood is not happy. Physically, he's still a kid... but mentally, I don't know. I don't know what he's thinking... I don't know how he reacts... He's so unpredictable. Please don't mistake me for saying this... If you don't feel safe... Call me immediately! I wish to meet the kidnapper... and want to ask him why he did this to my son. He will get caught soon... and you will ask him the same. I'll leave now. - Take care - One minute. Ajay haven't responded to anyone but... he threw the stick the moment you commanded him. Why? I don't know. Maybe... the kidnapper might have trained him by commanding. So he might have responded when I commanded him. We will see tomorrow, bye. ♪ Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Up above the sky so high ♪ ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ ♪ Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ In the crowd... I have just missed you! That's why I came now. Where is your mother? Cyrus! Goutham! CYRUS! Goutham! Ritu... What happened? Cyrus! Cyrus... - What happened? - Cyrus Nothing..he's been sedated. Call the cops. [Recorded voice] ♪ Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Up above the sky so high ♪ There's a shiver in his voice. It sounds like a cry for help. The guy who came... spoke in sign language. Okay... Ajay... Hello My name is D - A - V - I - D What is your name? If you understand, nod your head This doesn't look like normal sign language. It looks like a secret communication between them. He needs help. If he can sing, then why isn't he speaking normally? Stress... Either he should cry or... should shout out in anger. Only in his prime emotion, he will be able to speak But most importantly... He should trust at least one person with unshakeable faith. Isn't it Ajay? No one's around your house. But let's not risk it, I will leave a constable for a watch. Please search around the place where he was found. This forest is 1000 square kilometers vast... In fact we are right in the middle of it. So, where do we start? He's out there alive which put every children in this town at risk. Don't think about it, let them do their job. Call me if you need anything, take care. Don't waste your time on sign language, Take him to a good speech therapist. don't worry, I will fix an appointment. Doctor... ...shall we leave? See you Goutham. I couldn't see Kathir at all, Where is he? He went on a business trip, He's not even reachable on the phone. He doesn't know about Ajay yet. Kids? Not yet Raghu. I'm taking medications. We are still trying. Abi! Will you ask him to call me when he reaches you? - Abi, shall we go? - Yeah, I'm coming. Just relax dear. Hopefully, you will get answers soon. Take care. - Bye Goutham - Bye Goutham I know you hate me, Four years back, I spilled the words without empathy at her. and the relationship ended there. My presence now is only for Ajay and no one else. The moment I find what happened to him, I will leave. Don't worry! You've got a good family Goutham. Take care. I'm sorry Goutham. Goutham, I think the kidnapper is following Ajay and threatening him with something... I think... that's why Ajay is not talking. He will talk today, Just wait for sometime. You wait here, I will check it out. Cyrus, No. CYRUS... NO Please move aside Madam..Madam.. Madam, get up please. - What happened? - She fainted. Madam, get up... ...let's go to the hospital. Auto... Somebody please call an Auto. Sir, we have a vehicle here. You take Ajay, I will go to the hospital with her. Lift her please. Careful... Just careful. Cyrus! Cyrus... Brother... Did you see a dog with a red collar? There's a black dog near the garbage, check it out. - There? - Yes Madam. Cyrus, What are you doing here? I should not let you off the hook. Come. Cyrus, I'm going to thrash you. Cyrus... What's there? Cyrus Cyrus Cyrus... Hi Doctor! Hi. Car break-down, Goutham went to ask for help. I become little dizzy, that's why knocked your house... Wait Cyrus. Can I have some water? Doctor, can I have some water? Yes... Sure... Come. Welcome Ajay. That's an interesting painting, right? There's a lot of history behind this. Doctor, Are you staying alone? In loneliness... it's different from being alone. Water. Hot water. I think you need coffee. You look tired. One minute. Go Cyrus... Coffee smells nice. It's homemade. Thank you doctor. I will book a cab, will leave once it arrives. Okay. Cyrus... Mom can't stretch further dear. Doctor... If you don't mind can you take Cyrus for a walk? Please... Yeah... sure. Thank you. Ajay... Stay here. Run! Anjana... Anjana... Ajay... Don't come here, get out. Anjana... Anjana, wake up. You are alright Why would you come here Rhythm? Ajju... get out. AJJU... Cyrus... Cyrus... No Cyrus... Cyrus... stay calm. STAY! Don't leave him Cyrus. No..No.. Stay, Stay Cyrus. Rhythm... Cyrus... Good boy... good boy. No..no... Don't leave him. Cyrus stay! Rhythm... Cyrus stay there! Cyrus... CYRUS! Ajay... Doctor... Please... Leave him. Please. Ajju, come to mom... Ajju... Ajju... come here. Throw that away! STOP! Hold it tight! Ajay... I'm your friend, right? Slash him! Ajay... I say... DROP! Ajay... it's fine.. nothing happened..look at mom Ajay... Ajay... Why? Why Rhythm... Why? Ajay... This is a special place Rhythm! Let's leave... I told you... not to come here. Doctor. Come Ajay... Rhythm... Rhythm... Rhythm... Rhythm... He's injured! You go to hospital... I need to go to the station. I told you I will take care of it. No... I want to know why he kidnapped my son. How long do you plan to keep quiet, doctor? You have to speak, Why all these? Don't take my patience for granted... I know other methods too. I want to talk to Rhythm. No... You must talk only to me. Trust me Inspector. You will definitely get lots of interesting information. Why do you want to talk to me? To ask a few questions. Because the unasked questions become... the unsolvable puzzles! Why did you kidnap Ajay? What you did to him for the past six years? Shall we play a GAME, Rhythm? If you play till the end, all your questions will be answered. But... If you quit in between, you get nothing. What is the Game? The name is ONE-FOR-ONE You need to answer all my questions honestly! I will also do the same... Simple! But without rules... The game will not be interesting. I will say this once! Rule number 1: Each can ask one question at a time... and upon answering, can move to next question. Rule Number 2: We shouldn't ask each other the same question. Rule number 3: If you answer "I don't know", then the game ends! Shall we start? Shall I ask the first question? Of course! - Why did you kidnap... - Your turn is over! You asked, "Shall I ask?" and that's counted! Rules are Rules! Now it's my turn! My first question... Do you know why I want to talk to you? Because I caught you when no one ever doubted you. Why did you kidnap Ajay? What is this Rhythm! You struggled and found Anjana as well... but why selfishly do you ask about Ajay? You wouldn't be here if I acted selfishly! - Who died in the Lake? - I don't know him! He saw me while kidnapping Anjana, so I had to kill him. Witness clearance! How did you find me? I didn't find you... It was Cyrus! Cyrus? The dog? Nasty error on my side! Proceed! Why did you kidnap Anjana? Some animals don't see every living thing as prey... they choose their prey selectively! That's not an answer! I answered though, Why did you want to save Anjana? Anjana reminds me of Ajay! same age! What did you do to Anjana? All I want are organs... Fresh... Organs! I keep them alive and start taking piece by piece! Since they are kids, need to be handled with care... but that's when you came! Rhythm, How is it possible... being adventurous despite pregnancy? I'm just pregnant... not a brain-damaged! KIDS! Wait... When you say kids... you meant Anjana and Ajay, right? No doubt Rhythm, You are smart! Till now, I kidnapped 17 kids! And in this town... FOUR! All the kids... for their organs? Now my TURN! What I'm gonna say next, will it be safe for the baby inside? Even if she has a bit of courage like her mother, she will suffice! What did you do with other kids? All are kids... and they are tender... So once I remove the organs, I will allow them to suffer without sedative... and listen to their cry with bliss... then drag and... chop them into pieces... then solve it in acid and... the bones... the flesh... everything dissolves into a broth! Then I take it and... drown it in the Lake! CONSTABLES! Get up Rhythm! There is no point in talking further. Sir, he didn't provide the answers yet... Please sir, this game is the only way! - What you did to Ajay? - No Rhythm! Sir... Please sir! - He's far more dangerous! - We shouldn't stop the game! Drag him to interrogation cell! SIR! Sir, only he can answer my questions! We need to continue the game... We will be able to find other kids as well... - Please sir, give me a chance! - Poor girl! Give her a chance Inspector! It only gets interesting from here! SP(Superintendent of Police) is on the way, I will give you 10 minutes. These are the photos of six children that went missing in this town... Apart from Anjana and Ajay, I want to know who are the other two kids? You got only 10 minutes! Good Rhythm, I like your conviction! We are running out of time, So let's make this game more interesting! I give you 10 WISHES... You can ask only 10 questions! Same rules... let's continue. - In these..? - Observe the game carefully. Again... It's my turn. Where you got all this courage? Once you decide to get into the sea, You shouldn't fear of losing sight of the shore! Who are the four kids among these? You can't ask in a bunch... you need to ask one by one. So don't waste your wishes asking for unwanted questions! You may need them later! What consequences are you ready to face for your courage? Anything! Yes! - Are you sure? Anything? - Except for my family! Yes! Can you be specific... whom in particular in the family? My kids! No! Who do you like the most? Ajay or the unborn? Both are my blood! Yes! Both are your blood, but one belongs to Raghu... and one belongs to Goutham so... answer me, Whom do you prefer the most? Ajay! No! So, Is it fine to leave your unborn to die? Take a look again! I said NO! Now answer me! You only kidnapped! You are lying! Goddammit! SIT DOWN! The game's not over yet! Answer my question. Is it fine to leave your unborn to die? Until I'm alive, I won't let anyone harm them! Beautiful! You kidnapped Ajay... what did you do to him? If I had Ajay, I wouldn't have spared his organs! Now answer my earlier question... Why did I want to talk to YOU? If you didn't do... then who kept the RIP flower bouquet... Who was there in the lake with the umbrella? That... Why did you do all that? I haven't missed a detail Rhythm, so you find it. Even though I saw you in the lake... why did I spare you as a witness? Think! Think! THINK! You diverted the case towards kidnapper and escaped your crimes... Then why all this game? I told you Rhythm, I like your courage. I care for you! Now answer me, Why did I want to talk to you? Because... You wanted to find that my weakness are my kids. but, why do you want to know? You can't paint without a brush. You need to search in the right path! When you change your perception, everything will be clear to you I didn't kidnap. So, the kidnapper's target is... Ajay or You or your weakness? Think... THINK! All of them are... interconnected... and all are the same! Fantastic! Fantastic Rhythm! Now answer my next question carefully. Who... kidnapped... Ajay? Do you know him? Your ten questions are over... now answer my question! No... No... No... you know him. Who is it? Who kidnapped Ajay? Who? Don't get diverted Rhythm! Now answer my question, Who kidnapped Ajay? THINK! Come on... Think! Who kidnapped Ajay? I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! GAME OVER! You can leave now. No... No... No... Please tell me the truth! - Please... Please... - Constables... Please tell me who kidnapped Ajay, Please... Please Tell me who kidnapped Ajay? - Take her away. - Tell me please... Grab him! Rhythm! You played well! You are like a joker in a pack of cards! One can end the game with or without Joker! and you... don't deserve to live! Really? Ajay is not my prey! but still he's prey for someone! So, don't forget that. GOOD LUCK! Ajay... Goutham Please, pick up Goutham... Pick up! Ajay haven't responded to anyone yet... but still he threw the rod away when you commanded him. Why? It's been seven years now, We are not blessed with a child yet! He went on a business trip, not even reachable over the phone! - Goutham! - Rhythm... I'm sorry Rhythm... Ajay... Somebody please help us... Ajay was taken... by a... I saw a girl's hand... It's a GIRL! she went that way. Goutham, did you see her? Who is she? Who is the Girl? It's... a... girl... It's a girl! Girl? Who is the girl? Who is it? WHO??? Do you know why I want to talk to you? Why..Why me? All your questions will be answered Think... THINK... Think... I have answered already! - Think... Think... - What was the answer? You can't paint without a brush! Paint... Paint... Paint... What's in it? Charlie Chaplin uncle with an umbrella was standing there Aunty! I don't get it... If the perception changes, everything will be clear! So... kidnapper should be left-handed! Who... Kidnapped... Ajay? So, Ajay was kidnapped by... Why? Are you surprised? Is it because the kidnapper was a woman? or because it's me? You assumed that the person with an umbrella... should be a man! Where's Ajay? Did you find the left-hander clue from gloves... Or from your kid's sketches? Is Ajay here? Ajay... Ajay... Where is Ajay? Why are you asking me? Then what's the point in the kidnapping? You didn't harm Ajay, right? I will do whatever you want... But Please spare Ajay If I ask you to drink this to answer your question? Tell me now... So you will do anything... because he's your world. But, my world was shattered to pieces... I tried a lot to fix it up, but... I see only you in every shattered pieces. Teacher, Rhythm will do this better, why did you put it on Bhavana? Take this and put it on Rhythm! So for the fanny... All the school girls also many! The grass is the green... Since childhood, you are always in light... and I'm in darkness! You know whats the cruelest punishment in this world? To lose one's self and imitate others! Dad, I'm first again... in athletes. What about your exams? Rhythm is school first! What's the point in adding such useless trophies? Go and study like her! [Bhavana Mom] Yeah, you are always with her, why don't you learn something from her? Even though they push me to follow your steps, but falling in love was my choice! But even that guy chose you over me! Everybody asked me to imitate you and eventually I lost my identity. We got an alliance for Rhythm. [Bhavana Mom] Even our daughter is ready for marriage. Rhythm is an orphan, we should take care of her. If you keep pushing me back... then how will I move forward? Comparing with others is also violence! Throughout my life, wherever I go, I keep hearing... RHYTHM! Rhythm! RHYTHM! You destroyed my identity! So, I created one for myself! I want to pull this trigger... But I want you to see what's happening around... Then only you can understand my pain. You were crashed when your kid was missing for five minutes! That's when I decided... To kidnap him! I swear... that I wanted to leave him the next day. But, I liked the way you grieved the whole day! So, I extended one more day! You were in more pain! Then I extended a week, you were devastated! I started enjoying each moment and now... it's been six years! My 20 years of anger! Everything was fine until... the doctor copied my style of kidnapping! I got agitated... Somehow Kathir followed me into the forest! - Bhavana... - Kathir! Ajay... Stab him! - Ajay... Ajay... - Run away Ajay... More than escaping from me... I was pissed off that he came back to you. He shouldn't be with you. That's why I took him back again! If you want to hurt, hurt me... but not my kid. He's a child! For which child are you empathizing now? What did you do? What did you do? What the hell you did? Hey, Just chill! Why did you commit this sin to the unborn? Your unborn will be alive for one more hour! Where is Ajay? I gave the same drink to him! He should be dead now... or else... he too got one hour! I'm not going to kill your kids, It depends on your choice. I'm going to give you the same comparison equation that destroyed my life! Decide one among them by comparing and save! What will I do now..? You are going to save one and let other one die. and when you think about your choice... BHAVANA... Bhavana... BHAVANA... That's all you will remember... FOREVER! AJAY! Ajju... Somehow Kathir followed me into the forest! Cyrus! AJAY! AJAY! AJAY! Ajay... Cyrus... I took a wrong decision. I should have tried to... save atleast one child.
