Can you help me with all this? Steward! Will you help Mrs. Beresford with her luggage, please? -Do you know me? -We've been expecting you, ma'am. I almost didn't get it. Well, then I stand in the shower, captain. See you. By the way, is Mr. Conway on board? You probably find him in the casino's lounge, ma'am. What a beautiful day, Mr. Carter. Beresford, sir. Mrs. Beresford. Thanks. Number six, black, even number. Would you look at that. Bingo. It rarely fails. Punch out, kid. Pay. Thank you very much. So yes. As high as a mountain, the guy. Mr. Conway. Mrs. Beresford. One must admire Mr Van Heurden's impulses. I have felt such impulses, but I have never sacrificed dinner for them. Mrs. Beresford, are you kind and helpful me? I would be so terribly grateful. Only if you tell about your impulses, Mr Fairweather. I used to be a jewel thief, a very successful such- but time and age has decreased ability. The brain works, but instead to grow up locks, I cultivate the senses. I steal other people's ideas. In that case, Mr. Fairweather, we may hold your eyes and your hands in your pockets. Can I assume, Mrs. Skinner, when you have just joined the cruise- -you are interested in games? Not directly. It was in my horoscope that I would go on a Mediterranean cruise. Did it say something about a long, dark, handsome stranger? Excuse me, gentlemen. -Don't you feel good? -I'm just tired. -Do you need anything? -No thanks. -Do we still arrive on time? -Yes, we can. Incredible. nuclear Research Institute lies in the governor's mansion. IDs. Hope the guards do not know the real commanders to come. I brought it for safety. Professor Taubman, they are here. Do you let me in? Thank you, sir. - Thanks, sir. -Yes. Don't forget to look like an admiral. Nuclear weapon. The bomb. Now, Doctor Taubman. We should go now. The course is laid. Check with the engine room. Coffins? I will not load any chests. - The captain has approved them. - Cover them, then. -Maskinrummet. - Be ready for departure in about 20 minutes. We're ready now, mate! -Sir! I'm Preston, sir. -Really? The new pursern, sir. And you sign up for duty twelve hours late. - Report to the day officer. -Yes, sir. The clock is almost six for the phase. We should be on our way now. Welcome aboard, Mr Cerdan. I'm Marston, the ship's doctor. A political elevator, on their way to the United States for care. By the way. Nobody informed me about the coffins. -Good evening. I want to send a telegram. - You have to be the new purser. -What is this, some kind of code? -Send the fanfare, just. Okay, Rogers. Course 0-8-5. You have the command. Good night. Good night, sir. 0-8-5. - Hi, my name is Susan. -Hello. Tony. - Offer a glass, Tony. -Yes please. Carter, tell me. -No interaction with female passengers. -Good boy. I do not play. -Excuse me. - Thank you very much. Why haven't you changed? You can't hide behind the pillar. I wanted to have a glass, but room service is not available during the captain's party. Pssst. Excuse. -Yes, sir? -Sex martini to bring. -Why not take the whole bottle? -I like how you think. -Can I come with? -Not right now, but was home before twelve. Thanks Dad. Browning? Sir. Eyes, lips and tongue. -Everything suggests brain hemorrhage. -Stackers old Browning. I'm afraid he was murdered, sir. Assassinated? Why would anyone murder him? He received a message that someone didn't want us to see. To the Caribbean Star: Suggest you grab ... "Caribbean Star." And here it says: "Suggest you grab", I can't read the rest. Do you mean someone was prepared to murder- -to prevent us from seeing the rest? -I'm afraid of it. -But who? I don't have the faintest idea, sir. But I suggest that we change the course slightly towards Nassau. - And hand over the case to the police. - Exactly, sir. Well then. Browning, then? The doctor said he died a natural death. I suggest we let it stay that way. Yes. We keep Browning's body for the police and have a shine funeral tomorrow. 25 on red. I have noticed that Mr. Conway did not join us for dinner. Benson, don't forget the captain's dinner. Hello? Where is Benson? Excuse! Hi there you are! Hello! I apologize. One message to you, sir. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Carter. It's me, Gomez! Mr. Carter! -How are you? -I'm fine thanks. What happened? I think... I think I know where Benson is. Where? Probably a mile behind us, at the bottom of the Caribbean lake. Oh my God. Browning and now Benson? What the hell is going on in my ship? No thanks. I don't know, Captain. I really do not know. By the way, Captain. Can I ask a question? Yes. Preston. Was his letter of recommendation to your satisfaction, sir? - Can I help you, Mrs. Skinner? -No thanks. I'll go to my cabin. - Good night, Mr Carter. - Good night, Mrs. Skinner. Excuse me. Mr. Cerdan is asleep and does not want to be disturbed. I just came by to see ... Well ... Excuse me. No more efforts. Twenty-six black. Thank you. That's not all, the Frenchman. -That's not all. -I'm sorry, it was eight. "Desolé" or not, I have 20 here. $ 18,000. A moment. Take it easy, just. I ask the Supreme Court how the judgment sounds. Unfortunately, I agree with the croupier. Maybe I can serve you? We play it. Did you record it on tape? A little on the seven and 20,000 on the black. Voilà. A portable Solomon. I'll probably buy one. Okay, then we drive! Keep them you, kid. -Thank you sir. -The war is over, justice has been shipped. -It's twelve o'clock. -And? It's the Cinderella. Open, otherwise I turn into a pumpkin. Come in. God, you look awful. Any more bets? Not? It's foolproof. Excuse me, sir. Can I be of service? It's a fantastic system. Can it solve all kinds of problems, sir? -Like what? - Like mysteries, for example. - Do you have a mystery to solve? - It was just a saying. -So good. - Let's say I have a little mystery. - Could it solve it? -Yes absolutely. It solves everything except ... - Except what, sir? -Come here. Except for the big three. The big three, sir? Who are they? It's dead, birth -and my mother-in-law. Therefore, we surrender the body to the depth in firm and secure hope- to our Savior and God Jesus Christ shall resurface. Amen. -22 seconds. -So, the one who killed Browning ... ... must have heard when the message came in and been close enough to kill Browning before he could forward the message. After the timing, it excludes all except four suites. Conways, Van Heurdens, Mrs. Beresford and Cerdans. That's right, sir. But Van Heurden played and Mrs. Beresford attended the dinner. Cerdan was the end who ate alone in his cabin. And Conway, sir ... He was gone. -Conway? -Yes, sir. In that case, I will arrange a cocktail party tonight, so everyone is busy. Mr Carter and Mr Dexter fine-tuned Mr. Conway's room. With your permission I would like to include Mr Cerdan's cabin. An old, cancerous man? -No, you must not disturb him. - It only takes a moment. Time to play, gentlemen. More bets? 25 000. Mr. Conway, please tell me who they buried at sea today? Radio officer he had a heart attack. Well then. Carter, nine are Dexter- -and goes through Mr Conway's cabin. I prefer to take Mr Preston with me. As you will. There is something in the doctor's office about not carrying firearms. -Rogers? -Sir? Stay in the radio room all night. Lock in is. -Do not open the door to anyone. -Yes, sir. - Doctor, have you seen Preston? -No. -Doctor, has Conway arrived yet? -He hasn't been seen. - Doctor, do me a favor. -Not again, Carter. Meet me at Cerdan's cabin in 20 minutes. -Frun? - No cards. No cards. Thank you. It never fails. Excuse me. Who the hell is he? Do you know him? I do not know. I know no one here. Preston. Where the hell have you been? I have been searching... - We have to get out of here. - Preston, where are you going? We have to tell the captain. We should not interrupt the captain's cocktail party. We continue the search of Conway's cabin. By the way, Preston. What did you do outside the radio room? -Yes, I ... - You did what, Preston? I was looking for Mrs. Skinner, sir. So, really? She sent a mighty upset message, sir. Does Mrs. Skinner prefer young men? Corner, Carter. I do not have to endure such things from you. Preston! Can I have your weapon, please? Thanks, Preston. -No more efforts. -Who is winning? As you look, you are already leading. Number seventeen, black. -Allow me. -No. Some days you do not lose. - An outstanding man, Van Heurden. -Hurså? Banned from every casino from Las Vegas to Monte Carlo. He has found a way to blow up the bank. Now he spends his last days at a floating casino. -Hello? - Mr. Cerdan's suite? Mr Tony Cerdan wants to meet one of you immediately. He's with the captain. Yes. You should go to Mr Tony Cerdan. He's with the captain. Oh, good evening. I'm the ship's doctor. The captain asked me to check Mr Cerdan's health. - Don't you speak English? -I am German. German? I do not speak german. - How's Mr. Cerdan? -Good, he's sleeping. It must be lonely in here. The captain wonders if you want to join us at dinner. The captain wants you to eat with us. I have been given directives. I have to stay here. Well, I understand. Mr Tony Cerdan has said that his uncle is very ill. Maybe I can help him in some way? -I might be able to help him? - I speak English, Doctor. Your help is not needed. I have to ask you to leave immediately. Of course. Maybe you can help me to improve my German a little. - It's been years since I studied it. -I am busy. Can you go now, please? Of course. You obviously read English very well. I have some pocketbooks in my cabin. It was friendly, but I have to read. You have to go, you can disturb Mr. Cerdan. Of course, we have to speak low-key. Do you need something, you know where I am. - Thanks, Doctor. -What part of Germany are you from? -Munich. -Munich? The memories come back. I was there as a student. Say nothing. Hofbrauhaus, Schwabing and the Stachus? Not true? Have you been to Scotland? You should love, it's not unlike Bavaria. We have such beautiful mountains to the north and if you visit ... Thanks so much. Good night. -Conway, is he ... - Is he what, Tony? He happens to be a man which I love very much. Well. Well then. Excuse me. Get me a whiskey. I found these, sir. At Cerdan, sir. -I explicitly told you ... - Sorry, Captain. -Sorry, can we talk at outside? -What is it about? I don't want to set a scene. I have a weapon in Mr. Cerdan's back. -No true, Mr Cerdan? -Yes he has. Mr. Cerdan! She's here to tell you that we found the headphones in your valve. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Oh my God! I don't want to use it again. Ladies and gentlemen, keep calm! Can I get some more? Carter, take the men away! - You're making a big mistake, Carter. -Really? How big? Touch you. What? What happens? Oh my God! Stand up, Carter. Stand up and release the weapon. Let it go! -What is going on? -Tony. Okay, get them out of here. Come on! Sit in your seats. What the hell is going on? Mr. Carreras, Tell your men to release the weapons. Beware! Duck! The rest of you stay where you are. Unit three, confirm the engine room. - Unit three, is the engine room secured? -We are on our way. - Unit seven, is the radio room occupied? -Marston, come here. - Unit seven, is the radio room occupied? -The radio room intake. Doctor Marston. -I have to take care of the injured! -Okay, take them out of here. Unit four and six, come on. -Collect the rest of the crew. -We lock the crew in their cabins. You're lucky, Carter. It looks bad, but is superficial. You will be able to walk. You're wrong, Doctor. You are wrong. I can't go at all, okay? Take us to the hospital. - How's Captain Bullen? -He is dead. Unit five, report your position. Do as we say, nothing will happen to you. Carreras! You seem to have taken command here, sir. But before you kill any more ... I am old and have one last wish. I want to end the party. - Do it, you. - Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Up with you, Frenchman. Not a hijack ... Oh my God. - Stand up. -What are you doing? You, up here. It is Louis Carreras who speaks. Only the seriously injured are allowed to leave the casino. My men are instructed to kill- -the passengers and crew members who do not cooperate. The remaining crew adapted to their cabins. If you obey our instructions, so no one is injured. My and my men's orders must be followed without questioning. All passengers are moved within 36 hours and the crew of another ship. Send this immediately. Wait. Okay - No one is allowed to go. -I'll help the wounded. She is much more helpful -if she can do as she pleases. Why would anyone want to hijack the ship? Why? The cargo? -Lasten? -Human load, Doctor. There are so many multimillionaires on board to make Wall Street fade. Come on. Come on now. Come on. The Doctor, where? Where can I change? - In there. -Thanks. Doctor. Yes? Take Preston into the other room, are you kind. Okay. Come on, kid. Into the room next door. So yes. Take it easy. Take it easy. So yes. Put the weight on me. So yes. Careful, now. Mrs. Beresford. Before you continue probably one of us should not be here. Tony Cerdan, my God. Wasn't Tony's uncle paralyzed? -Yes, I think so. Strange. He wasn't when I just saw him. - What did you say, Mrs. Beresford? - That his uncle is not paralyzed. Paralyzed. Marston. Close the door. Come here. Can you do me a favor? -Can you knock out Preston for a few hours? -Never ever! What are you doing? They must have had a contact on board. A crew member must have put the headphones in Cerdan's suite. -Do you think Preston is involved? -It is possible. - Is it done, Doctor? -Yes. Can you pour something in the coffee to knock off the guard for a few hours? I won't do another one before you explains what you are throwing for plans. Everything is too well planned. Carreras is a mercenary. The one who hired him may be on board the ship. Well. 24, black, even. It was big. You, the Frenchman. Take it yourself, you are an honest man. If we cooperate, even though it is your alien- -so we are brought to safety on another ship. Fourteen people have been killed. Shipped over? Sure. We will probably be transferred, to a very cold place. Very uncomfortable and very insecure. For once, the captain is right. It should knock him out for about half an hour. What the hell are you doing here? I should kill you. The doctor said you needed my help. Who the hell do you think you are? The ocean's superhero? There are guards everywhere. Come on. Come on, you wanted to help. Do as I told you. - It's locked. -Try again. - There's no one there. -Okay, we're trying here. Do the same. - Mr. Carreras is asking for you, come on! -Hello! Check outside. The coast is clear. -Carter! You may not! -Not? Come on! Carter. Carter. It's a wig. - But what? - A disguise. Look. Lock the door. Warn me if you hear anything. Intravenous valium. Is it good for sleeping people? Come on, wake up now. Wake. Quiet. I'm the captain of the ship. Who are you? Taubman. Howard Taubman, United States Navy. Come on. Why are you disguised? I am a scientist, a nuclear scientist. Why are you disguised? Come on now. -Why are you on board the ship? -I've been kidnapped. Come on. What have you done on board the ship? A bomb. The bomb! A bomb? Come on. What the bomb? Bomb. A bomb. What the bomb? The weather is getting worse, so we do not go to the meeting place. I check on Gomez, who has the guard. -What are we looking for? - Take this. -We are looking for coffins. -Kistor? Shall we become grave robbers? -God, you have such a weird ... -If you say fixed ideas, I'll hit you. -I prefer to be kissed. -Light in there. That's how they did. Over there. Light here. They came aboard the pack thighs. That way. -What are you doing? -Silent. Explosives. -To what? -I do not know. Over here. You, a secret is a secret, but what are we looking for? -Oh my God. -What is it? Stop saying "man god" and tell. Help me with the screws. It's a bomb. A bomb in a coffin? -Carter, you're crazy. -Maybe it is, but it's a bomb in the coffin. Help me lift the lid. Oh my God. Don't touch it. It is not activated. Stand still. I don't want to look stupid -but what should the bomb be used for? You ask too many questions. Had you stayed outside no one had died. The bomb? The rest of the passengers and the bomb- -moved to another ship we meet up with. Moved? - But for what purpose? - Gold, Mr. Carter. American gold worth about a billion dollars. Never attack an American fighter? -In this? -No. An American precious metal ship, disguised as cargo ship. Can you understand that you once in a while was fond of the young man? You will all die anyway. -We have to go back before the guard wakes up. - Help me close the coffin first. -I need a rope. -For what? -Gomez, what the hell are you doing here? -I stand guard. -You are kypers. - They forced me. - They threatened to kill my family! -And you are their contact on board? Please Mr Carter, I want to help you. - I don't believe you. - Please, Mr. Carter, let me try. Okay, get a rope. Hang it outside the window of the hospital! Understood? -So, Carter. - Thanks, Doctor. Where is the woman? -Do you want another cup of coffee? -No. - Is your leg really broken, Carter? - Ask Dr. Marston, just. -He has multiple fractures. - See if you can get up, Carter. -Come again, get up. -Get up! Carreras, he didn't kill him. It was me. I'm not afraid of you anymore. You will be moving tomorrow morning to another ship. Out with him. Mrs. Beresford, explain again what Cerdan told us down there. To the passengers and the bomb is moved to the second ship. He said that we would all die anyway. The bomb? - Could he have meant the bomb? -The bomb is off. Yes, the bomb is off. That's why Dr. Taubman aboard the ship. To activate the bomb. -Oh no. -The plan doesn't work without Taubman. -I have to take me to the Taubman before them. -To disarm it, you mean? That's not what Carter had in mind. Not true? -There will be no trace of the ship and us. -You're gonna kill him, right? Come on, Taubman. -Howard? -Liz? Liz! Oh no. No. - Your bastard. - Bring her back. Oh, Howard! Howard! There should be a rope outside the window. Carter, it's been swept too far to the left! Damn it too. Doctor, do you have anything to swing me into? A rope, a cable? A cable ... The extension cable in the emergency equipment. Lovely. Mrs. Beresford, lock the door. Give me the other end. I'll tie it in the bun. -Can I help you? -The weapon, get the weapon. In case I don't come back, can we bury the battle ax? Of course. In your head. What the hell were you doing so? Because you kissed me in the corridor. Oh, Mrs. Beresford. You're gonna hit me again when I come back. Good God, I hope he does. He doesn't reach! Beware! He got hold of the rope. You have to get out of here, kid. They will kill him. They kill my poor Howard. He's on deck. Come on, your change. They have Howard up there. They force him to activate it. -It's enabled. -I remind you that your wife is on board. Quit it. Set it to half past nine. Kill him. Come on. Duck. Duck! - Cover the jetty. -Yes, sir. Come on. Return to the cargo compartment. -How do we disarm it? -It is impossible. The mechanism is locked with a key. It hangs around the neck of Carreras. -It's set to trigger half past nine. - It's about five and a half hours. We can not... ... sink it into the sea? The pressure would make it detonate at a depth of 24 meters. The ship would melt into pure energy. The sea around would turn into gas. Can't we just hide it, then? It's pretty heavy. If we lose it, I don't know what's going on. Then it is hiding what we can do. Here. Give me a handle. We hide it in there and cover it with tarpaulin. -The xylene barrel is leaking. -Delicious? Be careful, it is flammable. You, buddy. Can you tell us one thing? Who are you and what the hell are you doing? besides haunting me? A Unicorn One radio message, sir. The radio reports that scientists and bomb disappeared from nuclear research institutes. The police can't find the scientist's wife. GOLD MACHINERY GENERATORS CIRCUIT PAGE He'll be back. So yes. - So nice to see you! How is it? -Okay. -Taubman? -I explain later, okay? Just a moment. I know. I know it doesn't concern me, but ... Mr. Conway ... Who is Mr. Conway? You're right, Carter. It is none of your business. You haven't answered the question, Mrs. Beresford. A very withdrawn man with major problems. It may be enough. Problem? What kind of problem, Mrs. Beresford? - What kind of problem, Mrs. Beresford? -His wife though. He's in trouble. Are you happy now? What is he doing on board the ship? Helps an old friend through the divorce. -You are the old friend. - Very old. Who also wants to be at peace. You really want that, Mrs. Beresford. Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is the Caribbean Star. Signal letters G-X-A-Z. The boiler has exploded. Main and spare motors out of use. An emergency call, sir. Ships in distress. Carrying 2-2-5, 12 miles away. Okay. The boiler has exploded. Emergency situation, full speed ahead. Bearing 2-2-5. Captain, excuse me for waking you up. A ship in distress, 12 nautical miles to the southwest. I have changed course since then. Caribbean Star, sir. Prepare for seizures! Prepare for seizures! Stop the engines. - Stop the engines. - Didn't anyone mention breakfast? The engines have stopped. The second ship arrives. Ladies and gentlemen. Within an hour you are transferred to the ship Unicorn One. - They ask us to turn bi on the starboard side. -Confirm. -Sparks, confirm the latest message. -Board 15. Ask the radio room to signal to other ships. -Sparks, send a general exclamation. -Yes, sir. Give fire. They must be crazy. Unicorn One. The missiles are aimed towards your jetty and upper deck. Place is next to it. Whatever they are, then we must do as they say. Until further notice. Stop in the machine! Full machine aft. Unit two, be ready with the ropes. Unit four, be prepared to board them. Come on, hurry up! Open the cargo compartment! Unit three, begin the movement of passengers. Goodbye, Mr Carter. Where's the captain? Holy Mother of God. Come on, catch on! Come on now. Take the next pack thigh. In here. Full speed in a quarter. -Is he OK? - He's doing well. Oh my God. Carter, you had replaced it. - I did, I replaced it. -How in the whole peace did it go? -Nyckeln. -It was hanging around Carrera's neck. -I have to take it. -Impossible. He has too many guards. Do you have any weapons? - An emergency rocket. -Better than nothing. Get it. The xylene. If I could get over with one of the cranes- - then I can fire it down into the hold. Then I board the ship again. -It is impossible. -She is right. My job is to save lives. -Where do you have the pack thighs, Captain? -This way. I'm in the engine room. Marston. Take care. Hurry, we're running out of time! Kill him! Stay! Turn to port. Full speed ahead. The engine room. Full speed ahead, I said. Close the valves! Down in the cargo hold! Extinguish the fire! -Jump. Jump! -Jump? Cut the ropes! The engine room. Carreras? -Where is Carreras? -Maskinrummet. Carter! Open the main valve to the steam, we are running out of time! Carter! Open the main valve! Otherwise, we will split into pieces, both! Herr van Heurden. Can we talk for a while? You can probably help me. Something really worries me. Why are you sitting here- -When the ship is on fire around you? Another ship, 90 meters away, has an atomic bomb that will soon burst. It's not so ... You just looked at the clock. You know when the bomb goes off. Do you know what I'm going to do? Well, I'm going to sit here ... We are running out of time, but I'm going to sit here- -and make sure you don't leave the chair. Leaves your ass chair- - then I'll break your neck. Something more worries me. I thought that I had the key to the mystery. I thought I knew it was- -but it wasn't where I thought it was. You're close, kid. We have a saying in Texas: "The minute before you get hung up you see everything so clearly. " You are wrong about the key. It doesn't work without the professor ... ... and the monkey Carreras killed him. -You just got it wrong. You see... Is purple communication center has failed is. Doctor Taubman lives to the highest degree. Oh my God. Then things end up in a completely different situation. Okay, here's my offer: I provide the key, you let me try to escape. I'm not going far, they're me on the tracks, but that's the offer. Otherwise I'll sit here with you and blows up. -How? - Do you have the key? That's the key. -Good luck. - Good luck to you, sir. Carter! Carter! The key, Carter! The key! The key! The key! I have the key! You did well. - From Heurden. - He owes me a million dollars. By the way, Mr. Conway? What did you do on the captain's deck yesterday with Mr Carreras? -I just guarded my interests. -My father owns the ship. - Your what? -My father. That's right, Mr Carter. Take good care of her, and good luck. All the gold. Crikey. Translation: Emil P.W.S Holmgren
