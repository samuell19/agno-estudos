You remember that prostitute? You may not think this is funny, but why can't Sally swing on the swing? - Why? - Because she has no arms. - Knock, knock. - Who's there? Not Sally. He's not laughing. They're not laughing. Tell him the other one. What's the best part about banging 28-year-old girls? What? There's 20 of 'em. There's 20 of 'em! You guys got sisters? What's wrong? What? Dude. Answer my question here. How old is this girl? 15, maybe 16. That's way too old. Anything younger? - What age? - Our client needs her to be 12. I can get you 12. We'll get you 12. Get us 8, 9, 10 too? - Yeah. - Fuckin' jackpot, baby. You find the third girl. Which way's the pisser? Up the stairs to your left.

He dream like that a lot? That's none of your business. He said Swinton's name. So? So that's the cop that got killed right? Got the list. And we are on for tonight. Congressman Dunning's on this. I'll see you boys over there. - Congressman. - Say it back. - I wanna hear you say it. - Dunning. Congressman Dunning, you feel so good. How long has it been? Five minutes. Not bad for a politician. All right, so we have Congressman Dunning. You know, she kinda reminds me of Mrs. Richards, our fifth grade teacher. Bethany? Better get your eyes checked, son. Miss Richards is 53. Yeah, but think about the eyes. It's all about the eyes. You're a freak. How long have you two known each other? Second grade. Yeah. I saved his ass from a group of bullies. Been following me around ever since. Yeah, I remember that the other way around. You would. He's the reason why you didn't take the transfer to homicide. No, we joined the force together. We made a pact to work homicide together. Well, that's not what the guys are saying around the department. You're a dick. What are the guys saying? Calhoun can't work on his own. You're the only reason he's a good cop. Let it go, Jack. Doesn't matter. Mattered to Logan. He was pissed, screaming about it in the pen. He was finally getting rid of you, and you turned it down. Called you Myers' puppy dog. I'm gonna kick the shit out of this motherfucker. Not worth it. Just so you know, we're not done talking about this. It's Marjorie. I need a sec. Tell her I said hey. Hey, beautiful, what's up? Hey, man, what the hell happened that got Logan on your bad side? I heard it had to do with Swinton. You were on temporary assignment with him or something? You got him shot? Swinton and I were on a sting operation. I went to the head, and it turned into a shit show, and, uh, he died. It's as simple as that. You left him alone? Just for a second. Geez. Logan says you can't handle yourself, let alone anyone else. Yeah, well, fuck Logan, and fuck you too, rookie. You got a big mouth. Who else we got tonight? One more about an hour from now. Okay, go get some coffee in the meantime. I grabbed it the last two nights. It's your turn. You're a newbie, and newbies get coffee. Come on, stop being a pussy. Hey, I'm buying. A fool and his money are soon parted. I don't mind stretching my legs. You want a mocha, princess? Whatever. Turn that down. Our neighbors will think we're just watching porn. Yeah, so turn it down. Yeah. Congressman... - Hey. - What can I get for you? Uh, three mochas, extra shot of espresso, please. 15.50. You can keep it. Thank you. Calhoun. Hi, honey. How's it going? Hey, baby. Two down, three to go. What time do you think you'll be home? It's hard to say. We've got another job coming in, so that'll wrap us for the night, maybe 1:00. Can't you let Jack take this one? Hey, something wrong? Ah, nothing. I'm just... just a little lonely, that's all. The case will be over soon. That's what you always say. Never mind. I... I'm just throwing an old pity party. Wake me when you get home? Yeah. I'll tell you what. How about when the case is over, I'll take a couple of days off, we'll go up to the coast. Get out of town for a while. How's that sound? It's a date. All right. I'll see you in a bit. I love you. Yeah, me too. I wish it would just rain and get it over with. It's gonna get bad out there. You're not happy. It was fantastic. Mind if I take a shower before I go? It's all yours. You still listening? My mother always said lightning without rain is like the devil knocking at the door. - What the hell's going on? - Shh. Yeah, you been good to me. Think you can do something about this storm? Get out! I told you! Get out! Shit. You know, you can grab a table. Yeah, I'm trying to decide whether or not to risk it. I think it's gonna get worse. Yeah. Wish me luck I don't get rained on. Coffee's up, boys! Storm's letting up. Jack? Jack! What the fuck? Fuck! Jack? Jack! Bethany? Jack? Greenbaum. Jack. Tasty morsels. Greenbaum. Greenbaum, stop. Jesus God. So many tasty morsels. What the fuck are you doing? Stop right the fuck there. Get on the goddamn ground. There's no time. There's no time at all. No time at all to waste. Jack! Last warning. He told me this was the place. I knew this was the place. I knew this was the place that would stop them. Stop who? The demons. The demons like you. I'm not seeing it. What the fuck happened in there? Anybody, uh... Anybody been through the audio surveillance? Yeah. Looking through it now. I never seen anything like that. Was Greenbaum on dust or PCP or something? I mean... I've never seen a man do those sort of things to other human beings. Somebody's gotta call Marjorie. Anybody called her yet? I think it's best she hears it from you. Yeah. Best for her or best for you? Where the fuck you think you're going? Going back inside. You're off the case. I'm off the case? What are you talking about? What? It's an officer-involved shooting. No, no, no, it was justified. He was coming at me. You've been in there. You saw what happened. I put a fucking bullet through his shoulder point blank. He didn't go down. I don't give a fuck. You don't give a fuck? Jack was my best friend. And you left him alone, huh? Is that how you're going to play this, Lieutenant? - Huh? - If I don't get you fired, at least I'll get you out of my goddamn division. So you tried to get me transferred to homicide? It was you. I bet you had to pull some fucking strings, yeah? Your gun and badge now. Right now. You're on administrative leave, pending an investigation. Don't you call us, we'll call you. - Fuck you. - Hah! Stop it! What's wrong? It's me. You look like hell. Should I go see Marjorie tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah, she's gonna need friends. You should've seen her face when she came to the door. She'd been sleeping, so she was mostly sleepwalking. Then she saw my face. She knew... something bad had happened. You're gonna need friends. I got you. I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind. I can't even imagine what it was like. You've been through bad things before... No, no. Nothing like this. Never seen anything like this. None of us have. I, uh... I saw something, and I can't explain it. You don't want to tell me? Mm-mm. I gotta work this shit out in my head. Okay? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. You know that I love you. No! Demons like you. Jesus. Jack was my best friend. And you left him alone. Hello? Hey. It's Calhoun. Ryan. I'm so sorry to hear about Jack. Yeah, I know. It's shitty luck. Listen, I need you to do me a favor. Ryan, look at me. I don't want you doing this. Jack is dead, and there is nothing... What is this rivalry you have with Jack? He was my partner. He was my best friend, but I married you. Goddamn it, would you listen to yourself? This isn't about Jack. You weren't with Marjorie today. I was. And what I saw scared the hell out of me. I don't know what I would do if that was you. You always say never go alone, always have a partner, and here you are running off on your own. I don't wanna see you get hurt. I'm not... I have to do this. I owe him. He saved my ass more times than I can remember, and it's who I am. I have to do this. Look, wait, wait, wait a minute. I hear you. I promise you I'll talk to Logan tomorrow. You have my word I won't go it alone, okay? Would you come to bed, please? In just a little while. I have to make some notes. The basis of my research has revolved around the theory that demons of ancient lore and cultures were founded in early man's inability to explain mental illness. They looked outside of themselves for an explanation, and thus schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder, any number of mental illnesses had to be from malevolent spirits and creatures infiltrating the body and the mind. But it's my belief that deep within our psyche, we have our very own, very real demons. We use drugs and medications to keep demons buried. But if we could instead bring them to the surface, we could engage them and have a dialogue. Ryan, Ryan. Ryan, Ryan. Ryan, Ryan. - I need to talk to you. - We got nothing to talk about. Can I get you something to drink or something? Doris, he won't be staying that long. Let me ask you a question. Did you know Greenbaum stayed in a psychiatric facility? He did. You sure you don't want any coffee or anything? I'm fine, thank you. He did a nice little stay in there. Depression, attempted suicide. You want to tell me how a guy like that makes detective? I don't do the hiring. Do you read the personal files? All right, I'll have a look. Maybe I'll find something that helps your case, huh? I wish that was it, but it's not. For Christ's sake. Greenbaum's not the only guy to freak out when he came out of Auburn. Look at it. There were different circumstances here, but the killers both said the same thing. Demons. "The demons made me do it." We would've heard something about that. Not necessarily. No, they truck their patients in from all over the country. They bring 'em in from Ohio and Maine. So if you're looking for a connection, you're not gonna see it. But the topper is Congressman Dunning. The recently dead Congressman Dunning. He was gonna shut Auburn down. Don't you think that's a coincidence? No, sir. This place... This place is responsible for what's going on. I know it. I wanna get in there. I wanna see what they're up to. I wanna be on the inside. We don't have enough time to work up a case file. Let's just say that's my case file. The public doesn't know what's going on. As far as they're concerned, I've been arrested, formally charged, taken into custody, but the company line will be I didn't remember anything until you made the scene. And now I am being shipped off to Auburn psychiatric facility for evaluation. I know you play golf with Judge Friedlander. I know you guys are friendly. Stroke of a pen, you could make this happen. No. You'll be cut off from everybody. I wouldn't be cut off. I spent all night researching this. These places aren't prisons. You'd be surprised the rights these patients have in these facilities. Hell, I can get a cell phone in there. They wouldn't know about it. I'm fully aware I don't have a fuckin' leg to stand on here, but I'm asking you. Will you help me? Jesus. You okay? Yeah, no, I'm fine. You scared me. I wasn't paying attention. Why do you have those? Logan put me back undercover at my request. And they cleared you for this? Well, the shooting is still under review, but they reinstated me, yeah. Do I have a say in this? Honey, it's a psychiatric hospital for a week, maybe less. Four walls, three square meals a day, a bed. It's low risk. There's nothing to be afraid of. What are you afraid of? Everything. - Well, it's my job. - No, it's not your job! You're vice. It's homicide's job. Let somebody else do it. There is nobody else. Nobody else will do this. There's just me. If anything goes wrong, anything at all... I don't know if I'll be here when you get back. Hey, hey. Honey. Anne. Anne. Will you listen to me? Honey, it's gonna be okay. I promise you it's gonna be fine. I'm gonna reach out to Logan every day I'm in that place. Hey, baby... I am not gonna disappear. Do you hear me? I am not going to disappear. This is Dr. Hoch. Be right with you. Oh. You must be Lieutenant Logan. I am. And you'd be our new patient. Of course. Could you sign the transfer papers please? Oh, certainly. - There you go. - Thank you. By the way, Lieutenant, where's the psychiatrist report? The what? I see the court order, but there should be a signed psychiatrist's report. Well, this is all they gave me. Of course. Let's hope you get all the help you need. I don't need any help. All of you are the people that need help. Come on, Vallejo. Let's get out of here. Have a nice day, Lieutenant. Yeah, right. Mr. Calhoun. Welcome. Is she trying to contact the mothership? All the comforts of home. Feel free to move things around if you like. Is there a lock on the door? It's a forensic hospital, not a prison. What if I want my privacy? Humor. Good. Hey, those are my clothes. Not anymore they're not. We'd like you to wear these while you're here. Well, I know you'd like to get settled in, so if you'd change into these and leave your old clothes on the bed, please. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Logan here. Logan, it's me. I'm checked in. I'll call you the minute I find something. - All right. - Yeah, bye. I see you. I hear you in my head. I know you. Did she die because of you? You should've made the rookie get the coffee. You must pay for what you've done. No, not him, no. No, not him! Not him! What's your name? What? I didn't mean to startle you. I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's okay. My name's Calhoun. Ryan Calhoun. Ella. It's nice to meet you, Ella. Did you know that Shakespeare hid the truth in his plays? - No. - See? It's right here in Macbeth. Will was trying to tell us that... He was trying to tell us how to see them. See who? Them. It's right here. Look. It's right... Whoa. Wait. - It was right here. - No, it's okay. I believe you, I believe you. Yeah, uh, my wife actually told me that Shakespeare was an invention. Didn't actually exist, is that right? - Yeah. - Most of his works were created by a bunch of writers that wanted to remain anonymous. Yes, yes, exactly. Well, almost exactly. So Will, old Will, was murdered because he was trying to tell us the truth, so a secret society was formed to keep writing under his name. All of the truth, the truths are in his plays. They don't believe me. Well, I believe you. How 'bout that? Can I ask you a question, Ella? Yeah. How long you been in here? A few months. What for? I offed a guy in Vermont because he knew the truth. He knew the... Ella, am I going to have to take your book away? No, no. Are you here for me? Dr. Whitney is ready to see you. Okay. Okay. Hey, you won't tell them, will you? Mum's the word. Dr. Whitney? Indeed. It's a pleasure to meet you. I like what you've done with the place. It suits us. Are you settling in okay? Yeah. So far so good. Gonna depend on how I sleep. Don't be surprised if it's restless. It's common for patients to start having nightmares, likely from new surroundings and behaviors. Yeah, sure. So tell me about yourself. Well, there's not a lot to tell, really. I mean... Been married for 10 years to a good wife. I've been a cop for 17 years, and, uh... my partner and best friend was recently massacred by a lunatic, but you know that. We don't like to use that word here. Okay. What would you call someone who dismembers a prostitute and her john and then tears my partner apart and then decides to eat him? What would you call a guy like that? You tell me. I believe I just did. And you believe Detective Greenbaum did this? Yes, sir, I do. I didn't kill my best friend, so yeah, I know it was Greenbaum. I'm a bit confused, so perhaps you can elaborate. You believe Greenbaum did this, or you believe a demon did this? I never told anyone that. It's right here. You reported to the responding officer that you thought a demon caused this. Well, I didn't say that. I don't know how it made it in the file. If you don't remember anything, if you don't remember anything until your Lieutenant arrived, how can you be sure? I don't know. I don't know anything about demons. When the responding officer arrived, you were ranting that you had to kill Greenbaum because he was a demon. Can I see that? Do you mind? How would you explain what happened to the detective? Well, he must've attacked me. I mean, I wouldn't have shot him unless I was defending myself. How do you feel about standing trial for this? Oh, I'm not gonna stand trial. It'll sort itself out. Always does. Why do you believe you're here then? I'm here because I don't remember anything, and the court wants you to test me to see if I'm competent. Are you? Well, you're the doc. You tell me. I will... in time. Decker here will take care of your meds. We'll start our first session tomorrow, and I'll have had time to review the rest of your file. "Paranoid schizophrenia." "Mr. Greenbaum made it known he believed his wife was possessed by a demon, and that she'd unlocked the gates of hell, was bringing other demons to kill him." How in the hell did you get outta here, Roy? "Nellie Corbin. Murdered her husband for being a demon. Current status, discharged." "Thomas Chester. Assaulting a police officer after he saw a demon. Discharged." Are we going to the room? That's right. Time to see them. - They can come out now, right? - Yes. I don't need that, right? You have to be calm, so no one hears you. Okay. Okay. Where are you taking her? Where does the elevator go? How far down? Where you taking her? Help! Help! Let me go! Call my wife! Help! Get it away! Let me go! Get away from me! Let me go! What are you doing? Gross, isn't it? Yeah. Kind of like eating rotten brains. Okay. I smell piggy. Ella? Oh, Karl, baby. Here, grab a chair. This here is Karl. He's a little slow, if you know what I mean. Not slow. Medication. Not slow. Medication. Well, it's nice to meet you, Karl. And, Karl, I'd like you to meet my new best friend. Uh... I'm your best friend? Right, right, right, Karl. We can all be best friends. - Put your arms down. - Hmm? - Put your arms down. - Why? - Why? - Put 'em down. Don't let 'em see. I had this weird dream last night, and my wrists... - Not a dream. - What? Real. It's real. What are you talking about? What's he talking about? They do that here. They do what? This place. They take you to this place. It's Shakespeare at work. It's like magic. What place, Ella? Don't talk, don't tell, don't talk. Hey, Karl. Karl, let me ask you something. How long you been in here? - Is it three years? - Three years. Do you remember a guy named Greenbaum in here? Does that name sound familiar to you? Greenbaum? Yeah, of course. What did they do to him here? Did they do something to him here? Do you know where he is? Where did they take him? They took him. - They took him down below. - Where? Took him down below with the others. What others? There's too much chattering going on over here. Karl, what have we said about the chattering? Uh, chattering wastes time and confuses the brain. Mm-hmm. Hand. - What are those? - Your meds. - What kind of meds? - The kind you take. Drink up. Open up. Seriously? Very good. Now more eating, less talking. You are a very naughty boy. Ella likes naughty boys. Karl! I mean, it's true. Okay. Number. Yeah, Logan here. Hey, it's Calhoun. You enjoying your little vacation? Funny. Listen, I did find a few things. Such as? Well, for starters I found Greenbaum's file. Turns out not only did he try to kill himself, he was claiming his wife was a demon. That's his ex-wife now, so maybe we can track her down. Yeah, I can do that. What else? Well, he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, if you can believe that. Son of a bitch. How did those assholes upstairs miss that? There's way more. Over a dozen patients have been discharged from this place with similar demon hallucinations. They could be out there now, getting ready to kill. Can you get me a list? I'm working on it. I do think Whitney is our guy. I think somehow he got Greenbaum to kill Congressman Dunning to keep Auburn from being shut down. That's one hell of an accusation. I'd like to sit on that until we get more evidence. But it makes perfect sense. There's something else. They're doing something to the patients here. I don't know what yet, but they wheeled a woman by me on a gurney last night, took her somewhere. She never came back, and two of the patients were muttering about being experimented on. - Whatever that means. - That's a lead to follow. See what you can get on that. One more thing. Why did you put in my file that I said a demon had killed my partner? - I didn't. You did. - I didn't write that. You constructed the file, not me. No, I never said that. Hello? What are you doing? Uh, enjoying the view? All right, well, it's time to see Dr. Whitney. Can I have a few more seconds, Simmons? Can't you see these mountains? No, honestly, I can't, and I got a timetable to keep. Let's go. Yeah, all right, lead on. I keep telling you, Doc, I don't know anything about demons. There are many types of demons. Of course there's the type we read about in books, but there are also inner demons. Inner demons? What do you mean? They live within the dark self, that part of our inner world that is primal and instinctual like an animal. In most people, it's repressed by the moral lessons taught to us by society. Conflict occurs when those impulses... Impulses? Anger, violence, immoral behavior, all the impulses we're not supposed to react to. Hitting our spouse when we're angry. Kicking the dog. The sexual urge towards a child. Okay. Start talking about that last one there, you get into an area I don't want to talk about. That's exactly what I'm talking about. We all have impulses, but the conscious mind knows what to react to and what to resist. There are people who cannot make peace with those impulses. The demons within consumes their minds and forces them to act against their will. No disrespect. It's pretty clear you've never been a cop. Please explain. Well, I mean, I see things on the job every day most people should never have to witness. Uh... A woman with her head caved in by a brick 'cause she wanted one more toke on the crack pipe. Or... teenage girl gutted like a fish by her teenage boyfriend 'cause she wouldn't put out on a Saturday night. Or a six-year-old girl strangled and raped by her own father till she bleeds out on the living room floor. Afterwards, he just makes a sandwich and watches the game. And what do you do with the emotions of those events? I don't do anything with it. I mean, I just... I put 'em away. I keep living, I move on. Until they devour you like a demon. What are you doing? Are you okay? Do you see anyone in the hallway? No. Then I'm fine. You look like you've seen a ghost. A ghost? Yeah, you could say that. Whitney spook you? Ella, have you heard people around here talking about... seeing demons? It's Shakespeare. See? I knew I was right. Right about what? Willy knew. He knew about the demons. Others here, they knew too. What do they know, Ella? There are two types of demons. The ones from hell, and the ones that they create from humans. The human ones, they're more like... servants doing hell's bidding. But the other ones, the real baddies, they'll screw with your head and change your reality. That's crazy. Okay, stop. Ella, stop it. I'm married. Don't do that. So you keep saying. But I haven't seen her around here now, have I? Ella. Just pretend I'm dead. Stop it, stop it. Ella. You know better. Jesus. Back to your room. I'll deal with you later. The worst thing you can do for Ella is to encourage her. And just so you know, among her many issues, in addition to being a nymphomaniac, she's also a necrophiliac. She killed her doctor in her hometown and was having sex with the corpse when the police found her. Just so you know. What the fuck did I get myself into here? Ella, I'd like to talk about what happened earlier today. Ella? Are you having dreams again? What are they? It's okay, Ella. It's him again. He keeps coming back. He tells me what to do. I can't tell him no. He was great alive, but he was even better dead. You know what they say: There's nothing better than a stiff... Ella! And what do you think of what Ella did? Me? Don't you think I'm beautiful? Yes, of course you're beautiful. Wouldn't you want to fuck me even if I was dead? Ella... look at me. We can't make any progress if you keep indulging in these fantasies. Who says it's just my fantasy? Would anyone else like to say something about Ella's behavior? Uh, Ella stole my wallet. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. Ella doesn't steal. You don't have a wallet, Max. No, no, I do, I do. I set it on the nightstand, so she could take her money. Max. Max. What did you just say? I said I put it next to the bed, and I was even gonna give her a tip. But you, you didn't show up on time, and you made a mess out of everything! You know, if you'd just been better at doing your job, if you'd been better, then the demons, they wouldn't have gotten me! You know the truth! You know about the demons! You know! What do you know about the demons? What about the demons? - There are no demons! - He knows. He knows what Greenbaum was muttering. Muttering? In the loft, in the loft. So you do remember some things. Have you been lying? You... You all know what's going on here. I want some goddamn answers. You're not gonna get any answers with this kind of behavior. - Take him to his room! - Tell me, Max! Tell me, Max! Ella! Max! Simmons can get him back without your help. - He's crazy. - Back to your seat. He's crazy. You can't blame a girl for trying. - Where am I? - Shh. - What? - You're dreaming. I'm dreaming? It's okay. - I'm right here. - Sorry. - Hurt me. - Why? Hurt me, goddamn it. Why? Hurt me, or they'll take me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shh. Shh. Tell me what's happening. Tell them they're coming. Ella, tell them! No! Ella, tell them they're coming! Ella! Ella! I need to call my wife. I have to make a call to Anne! Nurse... Nurse Decker, I can't be in this room alone. I don't want to be in here by myself! Goddamn it! What are you doing? What are you... I don't wanna go to that place. Don't take me down there. Don't take me down there! Please, I'm begging you. I don't want to go to that place! Don't take me down! No! Marjorie, I didn't leave. I didn't leave Jack. Shh! Stop it. Stop talking, damn it. I don't hear you. I don't hear you. Stop talking. The demons. They're yours. You created them. Tell them to stop. Please make them leave me alone. This is Greenbaum. This is Greenbaum, isn't it? You think I'm gonna tell people what you're doing here, but I won't. I swear to God. Your treatment doesn't seem to be working. You made a mistake. See, you just need to let me out. You nearly killed Ella. She likely coerced you into it, but that's no excuse. You don't understand. You don't understand. Then explain. I'm undercover. We discovered that there were lots of patients from this hospital that have been... No, I'm undercover. We made this entire thing up. My lieutenant and I did, so that I could... No. No, you didn't. The fantasy that you're a police detective is a persona that you created in order to help you cope with what you've done. Well, you're wrong. I know who I am. Your detective personality appeared right after your psychotic break. I am Detective Ryan Calhoun. Call my fucking lieutenant. He'll verify who I am. You don't work for the police. Would you let me call him? Call him, and he'll tell you the truth. I just want to call him. Okay? Yeah, Logan here. Mr. Logan, this is Dr. Whitney from the Auburn... Lieutenant, Lieutenant, it's Calhoun. I need you to tell them who I am. They don't believe me. Whoa, look, everybody needs to slow down. What the hell's going on here? It's Calhoun. I had to break my cover. I told them we're investigating the hospital. I told them everything. I just need you to tell them who I am. Who is this? Calhoun. This is... This is Ryan. Ryan Calhoun. I don't know any Ryan Calhoun. Hey, don't do this to me. Look, I know you hate me, but don't do this to me, please. Doctor, listen, I don't have time for this! Mr. Logan, if I may, I apologize for the inconvenience, but my patient here believes that he's a vice detective, and that you're his boss. Can you please just indulge us for a moment? All right, fine. Do you know Ryan Calhoun, and does he work for you? First off, I don't know any Ryan Calhoun, and I've never worked with a Calhoun. Second, I don't even work in vice. I'm in homicide. Why would you do this to me? Why the fuck would you do this to me? Goddamn it! - I've gotta go. - Hey! - Good luck with your patient. - Lieutenant! Hey. Do you believe me now? Who is this? My wife. This is your wife? Jessica. Why? She's a good-looking woman. If I allow you to go back to your room, will you remain calm? Sure, Doc. This is Anne. I'm not around, so leave a message. Anne, baby. It's me. I wish you could answer the phone. Would you please pick up? Come on, just pick up the phone. I don't know. All the... Everything that's happened, the murders, all of it, I think it's a setup. And I think Logan's in on it. See, he's pretending he doesn't know who I am. If you could talk to the chief, or you could come down here yourself and just tell 'em... Tell 'em who I am. I miss you, Anne. I love you, and... I need you. Okay, I'm gonna go. It's time. Help! Help! Help! Help! Tonight the harrowing shall be yours. Don't fight it. We're just releasing your inner demon. Oh, fuck. The fuck? Oh, God! God. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. - Hello? - Anne, Anne, it's me, Annie. Thank God. Logan, he sold me out. He told me... Who is this? It's Ryan. Listen, you freak, stop calling me! Haven't you done enough already? - What are you talking about? - Stop calling! Stop leaving messages and go fuck yourself! Anne, honey, it's Ryan. Anne? Baby. Anne! I know who you are. Oh, Jesus. Anne! Anne! Hon? Oh, no, no, no. No, Jesus. Anne. Anne. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. Ryan? Yeah. Anne, it's me, I'm here. Who did this to you? You know. No, I don't. I don't. I don't know. You brought them. You brought them here. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I should've listened to you. I should've let it go. I'm gonna get help. Get you some help. You'll be all right. Get you help, baby. - It's too late. - No. No. I love you. I love you. I'm gonna make this right. I'm gonna make this right, baby. Yeah. Exactly. In his mental state, anything is possible. With his delusions, he could grow even violent. Make sure the rest of the staff knows what happened. Good. Yes. The police are searching for him. I've been trying to get hold of this Lieutenant Logan that he's fixated on. I believe there's something else going on that might help us find him. Yeah. We've been in contact with the woman, Anne, that he was stalking. I told the police to check her house for me. She could very easily be his next target. Okay, call me if you hear anything. Jessica! Whoa, whoa! How dare you come to my home! Why are you surprised, Doc? I'm a lunatic, right? That's what everybody says. Should make sense to you. I see the headlines in the paper tomorrow. Psychotic patient... escapes hospital, kills the doctor who killed his wife. What... What's he talking about? Shut up! Shut the fuck up! You know me. You've been following me. The whole time. Coffeehouse, park, I know. I don't know you. You're a part of this. Yeah, you're both part of this. Look at this. Here she is. It's her. She's my wife. You killed her. Why would you do that to me? I don't understand. Look at it! Baby, baby... I am not gonna disappear. I am not gonna disappear. No! Stop! Stop. Please don't hurt me. Get to know the truth. What truth? The truth about the demons. Tell the truth. Please. They're delusions. It's your mind! You're lying to me. I'm not crazy. Wanna hear my theory, Doc? I think I got it figured out. I think it's like... like lycanthropy, except there's a switch that he can turn on and off, see. He gets these people to kill for him, and they become the demons he creates, but they don't remember... till a little bit of that something, enough to fucking remember it, and then they think they're being chased by demons. It's terrifying. It's terrifying. You tell me the fucking truth. Just say it. Tell me the truth. Very well. Hell is happening. Stay back. All is special. All is special in hell. All is special in hell when you can eat the souls. Let me help you see. Stop it, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! I'll kill you, too, I swear to God. Stop laughing! Stop! I can't because you've got everything so wrong. And now for the final illusion to be revealed. Police! Get on the ground now! You have the wrong man. I didn't do this. I'm a policeman. I didn't do this! They did this! The demons did this! He... He did this! He's the one! He's the one you want! Listen, Greenbaum, you're gonna fry for killing Logan. My name's not Greenbaum. It's Calhoun. My name is Ryan Calhoun. No, no, no! I didn't do this! No! We need to take you back to the hospital, Mr. Greenbaum. Greenbaum? No. No, my name is Calhoun. No, Mr. Greenbaum. When you came home, you found your wife Bethany in bed with another man. When the police arrived, you were like an animal. Calhoun... My wife... Her name is Anne. A game you and Ella created. Ella who? Hi, honey, how's it going? We've got one down, two to go. What time you think you'll be home? Oh, around one, I guess. Got another John showing up in about an hour, so that'll wrap this for the evening. You're gonna need friends too. No, I got you. Are you worried about what that Detective Logan's gonna do? No. I mean, he's gonna bitch and scream about justice, of course, but at the end of the day, I know I did the right thing. Bethany had to die. And now you have me. And now I have you. Ella! Ella, Ella! Jesus! Ryan. Yes, yes, it's me, I'm here. Who did this to you? You know who. No, no, I don't. It was you. You ready now, Mr. Greenbaum? Subtitles by explosiveskull
