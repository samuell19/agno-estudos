(dramatic music) (buzzer buzzing) (people chattering quietly) (telephones ringing) (buzzer buzzing) [Gus] I know. $5,800, Gus. I've been on the hook before. Out of my hands now. You gotta pay up todaY. How, Mr. Finelli, tell me how? You got your headaches, I got mine. You know about my heart condition. Where can I dig up that kind of dough? You own a garage, a couple of produce trucks. You got a good business. I-I owe four months' rent. I owe back wages, I'm in hock. [Mr. Finelli] Your wife drives a nice car. I can't, that's hers. What's the matter? Are you afraid she won't put out any more? [Gus] The bank owns the car. You spend a lot on that chick, Gus. Maybe you can't afford it now. What do you want, I should cash in my wife with you? (chuckling) With my heart? (coughing) Now, look... You clean up these IOUs today. Otherwise, I got to send around to collect. (dramatic music) Mr. Finelli, please, one more week. What'll it be then? (people chattering quietly) (knocking) Still hustling laundry, eh Rudi? Ah, this kind of wash I don't mind hustling. No ambition. That's what happens when you grow up in the slums. Yeah. If only I had the advantages other kids had. Might have been something big. Schoolteacher, even. (Mr. Finelli laughing) See you at night school. Yeah. (dramatic music) This waste... Think it's getting heavier. So is the pay off. Hey, tell me, does the ratio of the net, uh, profits to the gross keeping pace with the standing overhead percentage-wise? I'll explain it to you some day. Don't bother, I don't even understand the question. Grease for the wheels of justice. Grease. And I thought it was shirts. (dramatic music) (lock clattering) Well, you feel nice and clean now, Sergeant? You oughta try one of these steam baths sometime, Rudi. Takes out all the poison. You've been on the take six years now. You ought to be able to afford your own bathtub. I don't get it all, Rudi. Just a little slice off the bottom. You'll make Captain some day, Sergeant. Then you can split the payola your own way. (dramatic music) (lock clattering) One more week! I asked for just another week! People shouldn't welsh. You can't beat it outta me! It won't do no good! (Gus groaning) (horn honking) [Lil] Gus? [Rudi] Okay, that's enough, beat it. [Lil] Gus? Not a word out of you-- (Gus moaning) Oh Gus, come on, we'll be late for the show. Gus! What happened? I saw somebody run out. Gus, are you all right? What happened to you? Who did it, what did they want? It's nothing... I'm all right. You're all right? Go on home. I can take care of myself. Yes, you look like it. I'm gonna call a doctor. Go home I said! I'm sorry, Lil... I'm sorry. Gus! Gus? Gus, please let me in. Gus, let me help. He'll be okay. Why don't you go on home? Remember, sucker, 5,800 bucks. We'll be back tomorrow. (dramatic music) (crates breaking) (tires screeching) (loud crashing) (knocking) - Come in. Sit down, Rogers, I want you to see this. (dramatic music) This is the big, big headline in Brooklyn today. And here with us is Ed Read. One of the enterprising reporters who fearlessly broke this story. Ed, suppose you tell us about it in your own words. Well, George, I've been working on this story for six weeks now. And I know there are between 20 and 30 horse rooms operating in Brooklyn. I've been in half a dozen of them myself. [George] Now, horse room is where you place bets on the races? Now, do you consider such betting evil or immoral? Not the betting, George, but the fact that a huge syndicate is operating with police protection. [George] How do you know there's police protection? The whole operation is too big, too open, too brazen. If I could find out about it, so can the police. And this is the crux of the matter. Somewhere in this town, there's a man more powerful than the mayor, the district attorney, the chief of police. Is more powerful because he has the police in his pay. The police will give protection to the gamblers. They'll sell it to the thieves and murderers too. I have reason to believe they already have. Now, that's a very serious charge. Any facts to back it up? Some citizens have been beaten up by these bookies. But they're afraid to complain to the police, who are all too frequently in the pay of the syndicate. When the law is suspended for a price, and truth and justice can be peddled on the marketplace, then every citizen's in danger, and the law belongs to the highest bidder. Well, Rogers, you're Deputy Commissioner of Police Personnel. Do you recommend we sue them for slander? Ah, look Norris, I have over 7,000 men under me. You've got to expect a few rotten apples. Oh, more than a few. I'm talking about a payoff that runs in the millions of dollars. And that has to include lieutenants and captains. As far as I know, a few inspectors. Our Police Commissioner agrees. I have a plan here for a wholesale shift in personnel involving every precinct in the borough. No one ever got rid of rotten apples by just shifting them around in the barrel. The men on the take will just start operating in the new precinct, as we know they always do. Inside of a week, the syndicate will be right back in business again. From past experience, we know that what we need is some honest cops to catch a few crooked ones. A group we can be dead certain has not been corrupted. I think I know where to find them. Who's gonna deliver 'em, the stork? You may be closer to the truth than you think. The Police Academy's graduating 40 rookies the day after tomorrow. 40 bright, ambitious young men who don't think honesty is a dirty word. I want them assigned to me, personally, and secretly. [Michael] In order to maintain secrecy, I established temporary quarters in a downtown office building, and proceeded to assign the rookies to various areas and different jobs. (soft music) Sit down, Mr. Harris. Thank you, sir. Mr. Heller tells me you did some intelligence work for the Marines. [Pete] Yes, sir, in Japan. I think you're the man for this assignment. This is the 65th Precinct. It's running wide open. Close down a horse room one day, and the next day, it's operating a block away. Sometimes I think the bookies run faster than the horses. (Pete chuckling) We want you to go in there and find out everything you can about the operation. Just go in cold, sir? Everything we know is in this file. Study it. Oh. This is a picture of Lil Polombo. We have a hunch she's a good lead. Her husband was in deep with the bookies. He turned up dead a few days ago. An accident, maybe. We questioned her, but all we got back were echoes. She's too scared to talk. Establish yourself in the neighborhood. This is a complete file on the widow. We want you to get acquainted with her. Get her to talk. We don't expect one man to come up with all the answers. But in the end, we want to know who's collecting the money, who's delivering it, and who's getting paid off. And finally, who's running the whole syndicate for Brooklyn. Oh yes, I understand sir. You need someone to work with you. Anyone you'd prefer? Jess Johnson. Johnson? All right, he's yours. Thank you, sir. Thank you. (upbeat music) Sure, you're a fine-looking policeman. [Pete] Yeah... What's the matter, Pete? Oh, honey, I guess it's just, it's getting back in to uniform again. (Pete scoffing) Sergeant Peter Harris, US Marine Corps. Now, Private Pete Harris, New York Police Department. Onwards and upwards. Like starting all over again, isn't it? [Pete] Yeah, except I'm 10 years older. 10 years handsomer. (Pete chuckling) I like older men. Oh? (gentle music) Things will work out, Pete. - I know it. - Mm-hmm. (doorbell ringing) That must be Jess. You got enough for dinner? Ever since you do homework together, I shop for three. (both chuckling) (doorbell ringing) All right. [Jane] Hi. Hi, momma. (Jane chuckling) Posies! I picked them in Prospect Park. That's against the law! [Jess] You're speaking to an officer, ma'am. I am the law. Oh, they're lovely. [Jess] Thank you. I'll put 'em in water. Ah, honey? Uh, while you're at it, would you put a little scotch in one please? Mm-hmm. (exciting music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (sirens wailing) Hey, officer, you're not in uniform. Hey, pappy. (Pete chuckling) Well, aren't we snazzy, huh? What a bomb, a real bomb. All right, all right, all right. - Don't overdo it, huh? - Very cute! Now you can put it back in mothballs. Why? Oh, uniform's the pounding of beat, honey. We're plain-clothes. Hey, Jess-- Like Badge 540 here. Hey, Pete, I want you to watch this guy. Watch him closely. See how he does it, you may learn something. What's he talking about? Oh, it's nothing, honey. It's our first assignment as plain-clothes officers. Didn't you tell her how we're gonna lower the boom on the bookie syndicate? Jess, will you shut up? This is supposed to be a secret investigation. We can tell her. [Michael] Pete rented an apartment on 29th Avenue, near the Polombo garage. A few of the younger men who could pass for students were ordered to enroll at different colleges, known hotbeds for gambling. Others got jobs as truck drivers, telephone line men, and waiters. Some of the rookies were given a course in wiretapping procedure. - Hi, pappy. - Hi. Hey, this ain't a bad looking joint. We could throw a little party in this place. (Pete chuckling) All in a night's work, you understand what I mean? Yeah, well I just may do that, but, uh, you're not invited. Some buddy. Widow, huh? She's not a bad looking dame. I don't care what she looks like. She's gonna appeal to me. You're really going on the make, huh? You know a better way to get a dame to talk? No. Seriously, Pete, you wouldn't go that far, would ya? Seriously? Yeah, I'd go that far. Badge 540. New York's finest. You heard what the man said about opportunity. Well, I wanna be at the head of that line. Look, you look that file over, and in about 10 minutes, you go down the corner bar. I'll see you there. If I get a lead on anything, follow me out of there and look the place over from the outside. Well, I'm off to the garage, and a start of a beautiful friendship. Remember, when you see me, you don't know me. [Michael] Harris' story was that he had just returned to Brooklyn after living in California. He knew Lil Polombo was now running her late husband's garage. (car horns honking) (soft music) [Pete] May I arrange a park here by the month? $25. One wash job a week, no pick-ups, no deliveries. Fine. I just moved in to the neighborhood. Is there a shoe repair around here? Right down the block there's a shoe repair, a delicatessen, bar, candy store and a fortune teller. Thanks. If I need anything else, I'll ask the fortune teller. That'll be $25 in advance. Fine. (upbeat jazz music) You know, there's a horse named Uncle Barney looks good in the fourth at Hollywood Park. You know where I can lay a bet? Why gamble? Save your money for the better things in life. Like whiskey. (Pete laughing) Well, the odds at 20 to one looks good to me. Do you know where I can lay a bet? - Tell you what. - Yeah? There's a Hecht's stand down the street. Yeah? Get a cabby, it'll take you out to I. Guardia. Hop on a plane, and you'll be in California in time for the race. (both laughing) Oh, Mervin, if I were single, I'd marry you. Mwah, you doll! Hiya, folks. What'll you have? - Beer. - Two beers, draft. [Mervin] Two beers, draft. Comin' up. I heard about your husband. It's too bad. It must have happened right after he took that shellacking. Make a donation in his name. I'm just trying to put you wise. To what? Well, when you've been around as long as I have, you know a couple of things. Uh, Gus had insurance, didn't he? So? So play it smart. In suicide, they don't pay double indemnity. Who said anything about double indemnity or suicide? Everybody carries double indemnity. Now look... If those insurance sticks find out about that strong-arm treatment, they're gonna snoop around for five years to prove that Gus was in trouble and that he drove himself off the road. Hey, all of a sudden, you're so interested in my welfare. Now I know it's none of my business, but uh, I know you're alone now and I'm kind of alone, I thought-- So we orphans have to kind of take care of each other, huh? Ah, the gentleman from California. Hi, can I buy you a drink? I already had one, but you can give me your car keys. You took them with you, and your car's blocking traffic in my garage. Oh, I'm sorry. Thanks. Uh, why don't you sit down? All right. I thought everybody was moving the other way. How come you come from the coast here? (Pete chuckling) [Pete] Business. [Rudi] Oh yeah, a special kind? Rudi's a business expert. He drives a laundry truck. Your business, my business, his business. (Pete laughing) I don't mind. I had a piece of luck, an aunt left me a couple of houses the other side of Mannick Avenue. I grew up around there. Around here? Yeah. Yeah, I've been looking at you over my shoulder up here. Aren't you Lil Alexander? [Lil] I-I was. PS 47, sixth grade, Miss Lederman's class, right? - No, what? - Huh? I don't believe it! (Pete laughing) Well, I don't remember you. Well, I sure remember you. We were both 12 years old. I was looking at you, but uh, you were looking at those big guys of 14. Oh, that's me all right, always looking at 'em. Trouble with me is I never got past the fifth grade. (Pete and Lil chuckling) Oh well, uh, I've got some business. I'll see you around. And uh, remember, just say the word. Sure Rudi, thanks. Well, I guess I'd better get back too. So the grease monkeys can get a break. Hey uh, wait a minute, you might need my keys. [Lil] Oh, I almost forgot them. I don't even know your name, is it still the same? Mrs. Polombo. Well uh, it was... I-I guess it still is. My husband's dead. On. Just Lil. (upbeat jazz music) Get me another beer, huh? Okay So you went to PS 47, huh? [Pete] That's right. [Mervin] It isn't too late, you can make that bet. [Pete] Yeah? Back of the barber shop, around the corner here. Tell them Mervin the cheerful loser sent ya. And while you're there, give my love to my response. (Pete chuckling) Here, for you, I feel lucky. One on the house. Aw, thanks. (people chattering quietly) (telephones ringing) 10 to win on Uncle Barney. [Announcer] In the spread sheets, Coffee Clutch, Big Emma, Coral D and King Jonas. They're coming down to the line of finish, it's Coffee Clutch by a length and a half, Big Emma, Coral D and King Jonas. I haven't seen you around. I just moved in to the neighborhood. First National? I got a check for $10 on Pete Harris. Is it good? For 10 bucks, you got to check with Dunn & Bradstreet? (Mr. Finelli chuckling) You'll be surprised at things horse players will try. [Announcer] And now the changes for the third race. Scratch, Molly Q. Jockey substitution. Mr. McCoy will be ridden by-- Come on, I want to get in on this race. Go on and take my watch. Take his bet. If you don't mind, I'll hold on to the bank. They shouldn't be disappointed I didn't wait. [Bookie] All bets are closed. [Announcer] Sarah, Mr. McCoy moving up, Uncle Barney in fourth, Pam on the outside. They're coming out of the line of finish and it's Uncle Barney by a nose, Molly Q by a length and a half, Mr. McCoy by a length, followed by-- [Pete] Uncle Barney on the nose. Check's good, pay the man. (telephones ringing) (people chattering quietly) (dramatic music) (dog barking) Well, we're overloaded on both our queue and Hollywood Park tomorrow. I think we ought to cover ourselves and spread some of it around a bit. [Ralph] Good idea, Finelli, will do. (dramatic music) Hey! What are you doing? Oh, I'm sorry, officer, I got jerked, I locked myself out. Do you live around here? Yeah, that's right, a couple of blocks over, 251 Anthony Place. Let's see your registration. Sure. [Ralph] What was the take today? Well, we've cleared 30 G's. [Ralph] Good. Good, Finelli. (dramatic music) Okay? You'd better get yourself some new plates. Those out-of-towners are only good for 30 days. Thanks. Good night, officer. (dramatic music) Hey, you! [Michael] The horse rooms were located. Motion pictures, photographs, tape recordings were made. A mountain of evidence was collected. But none of this led beyond the small fry, the petty hirelings of the syndicate. The problem remained: How to find the higher ups and the police who were selling protection? [Ralph] Good. Good, Finelli. (Ralph chuckling) If that reporter thought he was hurting us with that TV broadcast, he ought to come with to us to the bank. Rogers, I think now is the time to order the complete shift of police personnel. A real shake up. The word'll be passed around, new contacts made and protection arranged for. This business is too lucrative to stop even for one day. Oh, I agree. A lot of the reorganization will be done on the phone, fast. Now we're in a position to pick it up. (dramatic music) Ah. I see the heat's on, even in here. Well, at least this heat can't send a man to Flatbush. Oh, Rudi, it's uh, Sergeant Bonney. He's your new contact. You're gonna like our laundry service, Sergeant. You better take a good gander, so you don't make any mistakes. I'll recognize you. You got that cop look. What's that? Like you never missed a meal in your life. Finelli said there was this guy hanging around the alley. When he spotted Finelli, he took off fast. Was he wearing sneakers? Sneakers or Florsheims, who cares? If he was wearing sneakers, probably he's a second story man casing the joint for a heist. Sure, what else? Any cheap crook thinks when he knocks off a bookie, he'll be scared to go to the cops. I'll keep an eye open. Any guy who gets ideas will be telling it to the coroner. That's right, Sergeant, do your duty. Pete, I'm worried. I've been worried ever since Fat Boy spotted me in that alley. You think Finelli caught on? I don't know. Could be. Look, Pete, let's stay clear for a while. Nope. We do that, we'll never get anything done. We've gotta make that pass tonight. Look, Pete, why take a chance? Why blow the whole thing? If you feel that way about it, I'll pick up the take myself. You can sit this one out. Come on, huh? You know I wouldn't feel right about that. I can't force you, Jess. Okay Okay, you win. What time, where do we meet? Make it 2:00 a.m., huh? I've got a date with Lil tonight. She told me Gus was in hock to the bookies. Now I want to get the blow by blow about the why and the how he died. [Jess] What happens if you strike out? Well... Weekend in Atlantic City, huh? Then you can really find out everything she knows.

What do you want to know? I-I don't think you're really the kind of guy you pretend to be. - Hmm? - You know. This easy come, easy go, around the world in a balloon type. L-I don't think that's your type at all. No? Please, what is my type? I think you're a serious Joe. You see something. See something you want and you go after it. Is that bad? I like the serious type. The do it for kicks guys, they're so mean. Hey, can I join the party? Well, Mr. Harris invited me out, Rudi. Did you invite Rudi too? No. He says you're not invited. Want to be alone, huh? Okay- - Pretty sensitive type, huh? One date, he's ready to move in and play house. Did you know him from before? I met him the night Gus was beat up. Oh, yeah, why was your husband beat up? Oh, bookies, I guess. He owed 'em a mint. Did Gus kill himself? You don't by any chance have a connection to an insurance company? Huh? Oh, forget it. And tell me about yourself. Oh, come on, we better eat before we catch that show, huh? (gentle music) Thanks, Pete. I enjoyed the show very much. How about making me a cup of coffee? I don't think I'd better... Besides, I don't have any coffee. How about tea? Hot water? That's what I'm afraid of getting in to. There's an actor that parks his car in the garage who gave me two tickets for a play next Wednesday night. [Pete] All right. I'll pick you up about seven o'clock? No, we'll pick it up from here. Promise? And I'll circle the block once, so that'll be plenty of time. - Look, Pete-- - Do you want to drive? I'll do it myself. Take care of yourself. (dramatic music) Police. Look, wait a minute-- (gun firing) [Sergeant Bonney] It's a cop. (trashcans clattering) Jess? Jess! Je... (Sergeant Bonney groaning) And you just happened to be in the alley? I-I got a tip somebody was trying to break in to the barber shop. Who tipped you? An informer. It must have been Finelli. I've never heard of Finelli. And I tell ya I didn't know Jess Johnson was a cop. Look, Mr. Norris, you better take me to a doctor. Come on and fight! (all shouting) - Oi, cut it, will you? - Come on, ya! Cut that out! Do you like his way better? Listen, he won't be an officer for very long, and neither will you if you try that again. [Pete] All right. I want you hear what's on this tape recorder. Play it so he can hear. Listen, Bonney. [Ralph] If that D.A. thinks shuffling around a bunch of flatfeet would drive us out of business, he better get himself a new crystal ball. [Mr. Finelli] Just because the D.A.'s driving a three year old car is no reason why we should. What's the orders? [Ralph] Business as usual. Deliver the bundle on the first same as always. New man's name is Bonney, got it? [Mr. Finelli] Bonney. Okay, I'll see he's taken care of. Do you want to hear it again, Bonney? So you didn't know he was a cop? Did you know what was on that tape? How could I know? Who else was in on the take? And who's the boss? You want to know how it's gonna sound in court when I try you for murder? You want to know what the jury's gonna hear? You think you'll convince them you were just doing a job? Shooting a prowler? We book him for conspiracy and first degree murder. Stay here while I call the Police Commissioner. Sit down. I want some, some water. I'll get it for you. (dramatic music) (glass shattering) I was just getting him a drink of water and he... You better get down there. You stay here. What are you doing? I gotta spend more time at the apartment. Now? Now. Polombo woman gave me an important lead. She told me her husband was beat up by the bookies just before he was killed. I got a plan. I want to find out who's behind all that. You might wind up killed too, like Jess. Jess' death was an accident. Couldn't be helped. Pete, do you have to go through with this? Yeah, I gotta go through with it, okay? No, honey, no, I could tell them that I'm quitting, because my little wife is afraid. I am afraid. Not just because of the danger. Well then, what is it? It's what's happening to you. Nothing else matters any more. Is the job so important? Yeah, it's important to me. Look, Janey. I gotta make it. Don't you understand that? I'll pass Finelli a big check and then close up my account at the bank. He'll send his collectors around and I'll squat with the cops. See, that way, we'll get a line on the muscle men and maybe on the police at the same time, right? If you live to tell us about it. [Pete] I can take care of myself. I'll be waiting for 'em. But Norris won't go for it, Harris. Yeah? Okay, it was just an idea. What's my next move? We raided the room behind the barber shop. It was empty. They were tipped off. You find the new horse room, keep on betting. I'm assigning another man to work with you and tap the new lines. (dramatic music) [Michael] Harris found out from the corner shoeshine boy that Finelli had moved his horse room behind Tony's bar. There he deliberately passed a bad check for $300. (phone ringing) Yeah? Oh, Lil, hello. I-I was calling about tonight. I hadn't seen you around so long, I thought maybe you'd forgotten. The show? No, no, no I didn't forget, it's just that, well, I've been busy. You know, uh, problems, problems. Oh, well, maybe I can help you with them. Now, listen, you take that understanding note out of your voice or I'll be crying on your shoulder. Well, maybe I'd like that. Never tried the Girl Scout bit. (dramatic music) I'll pick you up about seven o'clock? Seven will be fine. Now, where are my merit badges? Goodbye. (knocking) You're making a big mistake, buddy. [Pete] Get over there. Up against the counter, come on, move! [Henchman] You're trying to kill-- [Pete] Come on, pull your feet out. [Henchman] Closing up that bank account. Didn't you think we'd notice? Who sent you here? Finelli, or the guy that gives him his orders? [Henchman] What's the difference? Police Department, 65th Precinct. [Henchman] Get smart, buddy. Take a black eye now instead of a black box later. Hello, my name's Harris. Now, get this. Apartment 3C, 251 Anthony Place. I got a couple of goons here sent up by the bookies to work me over. Look, they're gonna be two dead muscle men if you don't get over here fast. Officer, what's your name? Who am I speaking to? Hello? (gun firing) (dramatic music) Rudi, help me get out of here! Rudi, let me in, let me in! (siren wailing) You boys looking for a guy named Harris? Says bookies are giving him some trouble. He's just plain drunk. (dramatic music) [Operator] Operator. Operator, would you please try Evergreen 40598? Yes, I-I've been trying him for about a half hour and the line seems to be busy. Would you check it for me? [Operator] I'm sorry, that line is out of order. I'll report it for you. Thank you. (dramatic music) Pete? (telephone buzzing) (telephone ringing) Pete, I've been trying to reach you for an hour. You said you'd be home for dinner. We have a date tonight with Neils. Hello? Who do you want? Pete Harris. Is this Evergreen 40598? Is this Evergreen 40598? You have the wrong number. [Landlady] Don't tell me you're his sister? [Lil] I-l happen to have a date with him. Well, he's in the pokey, deary. What happened? He was exchanging compound fractures with a couple of gorillas. I've had fights in my apartment before, - but never one like this. - Oh! [Landlady] Not even among the married people. You see him in jail, tell him to stay there. I ain't running no Madison Square Garden. (telephone buzzing) [Officer] Cap, uh, he wants to see you. Says his name is Harris. Yeah, I remember. All right, send him in, I'll handle it. Take him in. All right, don't get pushy. Look, Captain, I don't like to be pushed around, see? [Captain Wills] All right, all right. What's this all about? I owe the bookies a wad. So they sent a couple of strong-arms over to collect. I call the cops, and who gets pinched? Me! Look, I wanna get one thing straight, Captain. Who gets protection around here? Me or the bookies? [Captain Wills] Did you actually see anything to back up this story? No, sir, just plain drunk. [Captain Wills] Yeah, I can smell it from here. Look, I'm not drunk. [Captain Wills] Let him sleep it off. See how he feels about it in the morning. Look, Captain, there's a horse room on B Street. The boss' name's Finelli! Look, I'm not drunk! I'm not drunk! (dramatic music) (knocking) Uh, yes? [Lil] Does Pete Harris live here? [Jane] My husband isn't home now. Well, my name is Polombo. Uh, Pete parks his car in my, in my husband's garage. There's, there's been a fight and-- What happened? [Lil] Well, the cops took Pete in, and we think you'd better call a lawyer. I... Oh, sure. I'll call right away. Well... Bye. Goodbye, and thank your husband for me too. [Lil] Sure... Sure. (dramatic music) District Attorney Norris please, this is Mrs. Pete Harris. No, it's personal. Ask him to call me. It's urgent. 'Cause it's all a bunch lies, that's the difference. Bunch of lies. Well, there's one thing that's no lie, Lil. I got plenty of loot. What about your wife and kids? They got to come along too? I got no wife and kids. How's a girl to know? What's with this wife and kids routine? You know that Pete Harris, huh? Yeah. You think he's single, huh? [Rudi] I don't know. Yeah, you think he lives around here, huh? Well, he doesn't live around here. He lives at 733 Standford in the Hobart Apartments. I was over there the other night and he's married and he's got a pretty wife. And the whole time he's around here giving me a run. Well, I don't get it, what's his racket? I don't know, beats me. Maybe he's queer for widows who run garages. Oh, I've had it. I'm goin' home. Give me my shoe. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't walk, I'll drive you. Oh, no you don't. Thanks just the same, but I know that old bit. You drive me home, the next thing I know, you want to come upstairs for a cup of coffee, and the next thing I know, I'll be frying your eggs in the morning and washing your shirt. No thanks, Rudi, good night. (dramatic music) (typewriter clacking) Here's the dope on Pete Harris. We goofed, Captain, he's a copper. (dramatic music) (soft music) Okay, now try the phone. (telephone ringing) [Jane] Hello? Henry's Delicatessen? [Jane] You have the wrong number. Sorry. (knocking) Everything okay? Yeah. Finelli? Tell the cops we're all set. They can spring Harris now. (Pete whistling) [Pete] Hey, taxi! Oh, Pete, oh... - Your face! - It's all right. - What did they do-- - Oh, honey, forget it. You should see the other guy. Get him. [Jane] What happened? [Pete] The D.A. wanted proof. Well, I've got it. I'll get a compress. [Receptionist] District Attorney's office. Hello, this is Pete Harris. Can I reach Mr. Norris? [District Attorney Heller] Hello Harris, this is Heller. Where are you? I'm home. [District Attorney Heller] I just sent a lawyer down to get you out. [Pete] Get me out, how'd you know I was there? I told them. Lil Polombo was here. Lil Polombo? [District Attorney Heller] You're gonna have a lot of explaining to do, Harris. [Pete] Listen, listen, it worked out fine. I got plenty on the boys on 65th. [District Attorney Heller] I'll try to reach Norris and call you back. Yeah, okay. (Pete chuckling) Now, you don't suppose he wants tell the D.A. on us, do you? Listen, how did Lil Polombo get here, huh? I don't know. She was worried about you. Really worried. (Pete chuckling) I had a date with Lil for the night. Just how far were you prepared to go with her? Huh? Oh, honey, now wait a-- (telephone ringing) Well, that's probably Norris, I'll get it. Yeah, hello? [Operator] This line is temporarily out of order. Please excuse the ring. This is a recording. Of all times for the phone to go out of order. [Operator] Operator. Operator, there's something wrong with my line. [Operator] Call the Service Department please, 811... Service Department. Uh, operator, there's something wrong with this line. Sorry, the day crew handles that. [Pete] Well if there's an emergency, I'm a police officer. Police officer? Well, we'll see what we can do about that. What's the address? 733 Standford. What did they say? They said they'd get a man up here. (dramatic music) Easy with this. You drop that and you get up to their apartment without the elevator. What if it rings while I'm up there? Don't worry, it won't. Anyway, we'll cut off the calls from here. Okay, here goes. Get out fast. You're sore about that Polombo dame, aren't you? Not the way you mean. Suppose you think I gave her a raw deal, is that it? You should've seen Mrs. Polombo when she found out you were married. She tried to cover for you. [Pete] Isn't that to make with the hearts and the flowers? [Jane] It takes two to make with hearts and flowers. - Honey-- - You don't want to understand that you used her, you hurt her. Will you forget about the Polombo dame? She doesn't mean anything to me, and she doesn't mean anything to you. That's not what she thinks. That's right, sister, never trust a cop. Janey, look, will you-- (doorbell ringing) Oh. Yeah, come on in. There it is, right there. It's Monte. It's too bad, the show was just getting interesting. [Monte] 23 talking, try 3904. [Pete] I thought the trouble was on the line? [Monte] No, it's a short in the selector circuit. 9h, yeah? Well, go on, say it. What's the use? (sighing) It's taking him a long time. It always seems long. Mr. Harris? Yeah? Everything okay? Yes, sir. - Thanks a lot. - Okay. Okay Wait for Monte. - Janey-- - Pete, I'm tired. Okay, so I hurt her feelings, I'm sorry. She'll get over it. The work I'm doing is much more important. The work you're doing is making a big man of Pete Harris. You don't care about the bookies or anything else. [Pete] That's not true. Jess died because you were bucking for promotion. And you pushed him. Jess... I didn't push him any harder than I pushed myself. It must be a great comfort to him now. What are, what are you trying to say? There's a big empty place inside of you, Pete. It separates you from other people. Jess cared for you. I love you, and maybe that other woman loves you too. But we can't reach Pete Harris. We feel alone all the time. When a person feels alone, they can be indifferent. Cruel. [Pete] Well, if that's what you really think, maybe you ought to be married to someone else. [Jane] I thought if I loved you enough, maybe you'd learn that other people count. Janey... You know how I feel about you, don't you? All right, maybe other people don't count, but you do, you do! [Jane] Pete, that's no answer. It's all set. (telephone ringing) It's the phone. (explosion booming) (dramatic music) Janey? [Mr. Finelli] Hello? Hello. Call me back at Gantley 51099. (telephone ringing) Tell him I got to see him right away. That ain't gonna be so easy. Look, Norris is breathing down my neck. Well, I'll do what I can. Look, Finelli, tell him they already suspended three of my men. Okay, I'll be in touch. (dramatic music) Tell Heller that Thompson and Higgins just followed Wills in to the subway. What about Wills? I've got a team tailing him. And no Polombo? How did she find out where I lived? No, Polombo's clean, her story checks. Sure she is. Who'd she talk to after she left my place? She couldn't remember. I'll make her remember. Harris! We're gonna do things my way. What you learned yesterday could prove that Wills is working for the syndicate. It's an important lead. We still don't have the kind of evidence we need to close in on them. As long as you're on the force, Harris, you will take your orders from me. All right. Maybe I'd better to quit before I'm canned. (doorbell ringing) Yes? Pete! Well, what do you want? Listen you, what happened, happened! And I'm sick to death about it. Mr. Norris said that everything-- Last night, after you left my apartment, who did you talk to? I told Mr. Norris, I don't remember. Try a little harder! I can't! (Lil groaning) Now, where did you go? I... I went to the bar down the street. Who With? Nobody. Who else was there at the time? - I-I-- - Try to remember! I can't. Where did you go afterwards? I-I-I came home, I guess. Alone? Yes. How did you get here, did you drive? Try to remember! I walked! [Pete] Walked? Yes. Now I remember. I walked. I-I walked home in my stockinged feet. In-in my stockinged feet, I broke the heel of my shoe and Rudi tried to help me-- Rudi! [Lil] I'll get my shoe, my shoe... Rudi, he was there the night I was arrested on that phony charge. Rudi, Rudi, of course! I must have been blind! Do you know where to get in touch with him? Elite Bar. The-the number's in my book. (train rumbling) He's not there, he needs your name. [Lil] Can't you leave me out of it? Leave you out of it? If you hadn't opened your mouth, my wife would still be alive. Now get over here and talk! Hello? I-is Rudi there? [Man] He's across the street. I-I can't hear. Just a minute. (train rumbling) Well, go on. Would you say that again? [Man] He's across the street. Would you tell him Lil Polombo called and wants him to come over as soon as he comes in? Thanks. You're gonna do it. I'm gonna talk to him. And if he's the one, you're gonna kill him? You gonna get him here and kill him? Are you worried about Rudi? No, I'm worried about a guy named Pete Harris. If you kill him, you're just as bad as he is. Come on, turn it off! I can't just turn it on and turn it off! All right, I was trailing ya! You were had, you'd better get used to the idea. So I've been taken. I fell for it. (somber music) What do you want me to do about it? I'm sorry, Lil. I'm sorry it worked out like this. How things worked out wrong. I'm gonna set one thing right. (dramatic music) - Pete-- - Get in there. - No! - Get in there! - Pete! - Get in here! "No! Pete, please, let me talk to him, please. You listen to what he has to say. Find out what you wanna know, but please-- (doorbell ringing) Please don't kill him. All right, let him in. [Lil] Just a minute. Hickey, uh, at the bar said you wanted to see me. Yes, about last night. What about it? The bomb. Mrs. Harris. The District Attorney saw me today. He wanted to know who I talked to. Rudi, did you have anything to do with it? Now, what do want to listen to cops for? Forget about 'em. Think about yourself. Do yourself some good. Here, look... I'm gonna take a vacation. Come with me. [Lil] I'm sorry, Rudi. It's that cop, huh? Still carrying a torch. Guess I am. Don't you know he did a job on you? (train rumbling) (Rudi speaking quietly) Why don't you just hear him laughing it up with her? Telling her how you made with the hearts and flowers. How come you know so much about what he said to his wife? I get around. A laundry driver? Forget it. [Lil] No. It sounds like you know what he said. You did listen, didn't you? I said forget it. - Tell him-- - Why? Because you've said too much and because I know too much, and if I know too much, you'll have to kill me the way you killed her. [Rudi] Look, I don't kill anybody. I only take orders. [Lil] So they'll give you orders to kill me, and you'll kill me? They don't even need me to do it. Don't you know what this is? This is a million bucks. One million bucks every week. They've got hundreds of runners. The whole city's sewed up. Cops right up to the top. They can squash you like a bug, and me. [Lil] Like they squashed Gus? Shut up! You killed him! You were there and you beat him up! Now, you listen to me and you listen hard. You shoot off your mouth and what happened to Gus is nothing to what'll happen to you. Now, you remember that. (dramatic music) Pete? [Rudi] From us, Captain Wills. You always get curb service. [Captain Wills] Thanks. It's the interurban Laundry, Protona Avenue 112th. [Man] Got it. [Captain Wills] Be needing this paper, Mr. Edmondson? Just the race results. [Captain Wills] There's a story on page one: Woman was killed. It was an accident. Bonney, Johnson, Mrs. Harris. All accidents? Look, I've had it. Take a walk, Rudi, this is private. According to my figures, you've taken over 30 grand from us in the past six years. We were looking the other way when the bookies came around. Not for murder. I can see your point. Look, I can't take any more. There's a letter in my pocket. My resignation from the force for reasons of health. I'm turning it over to the Commissioner tomorrow. Tear it up, Wills. We need you right where you are. At the police station. If you resign now, others will panic. And we've got an organization we have to keep running. The D.A.'s on my back. There's an investigation, three of my men are on the list-- Now, pull yourself together, nobody's testified against us yet. I'm through, Edmondson. One way or another, I am through. All right, Wills. Let's play table stakes. You're afraid of what the D.A. will do to you. Well, we have a lot more to lose. That's my hand, Wills. You want to call it? Give me that letter. (dramatic music) [Rudi] Hold it right there. Drop it. Get in there. Harris! You know him? He's a cop. That Harris? Yeah, he was just standing there listening. He was alone. I'm afraid, Harris, you know too much. Another accident? [Ralph] Should I send him back to the D.A.? Where does it end? You ask too many questions. Rudi. Come on. [Pete] Suppose it's too late to ask for police protection. [Rudi] Come on, come on! Hold it! Drop it, Rudi. Drop it! (glass shattering) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (bullet ricocheting) (steam hissing) (gun firing) (tires screeching) (gun firing) (gun firing) (Rudi groaning) The smashing of the bookie ring is the big, big story in Brooklyn today. And here is some candid camera shots to tell you that story. This is the laundry where it all happened last night. The raid produced the names of dozens of police officers who have been selling protection to the bookies. With the arrest of millionaire boss bookie, Ralph Edmondson, District Attorney Norris struck a death blow at the syndicate that has been terrorizing Brooklyn. I was wondering how you were feeling, Pete? Oh, I-I feel fine. Fine, thanks. I came to say goodbye. I won't be around anymore, I'm selling the garage. There's nothing to keep me around here. Is there? No, I guess not. Good luck. Yeah, well, I'll see you around. Yeah. Sure. (soft music) It's a nice day. For Brooklyn. (operatic sweeping music)
