"Flattened Rice Cakes" by Morikazu Kumagai This painting... How old was the child who painted it? Your Majesty... MORI, THE ARTIST'S HABITAT All along, I can say that you and I We have been traveling on a train called Romance The older woman, she's too beautiful for me... There's a man you might like, Mie. - Which man? - The one... Wait...He's got a wife, right? A bug. - See it? - It's gone. Aunt Hideko. Yes? Did you hate your first husband? No. He was a nice man. Hold on, there you are. Here it is. Good morning. The nameplate. - No! - Yes. - Tell me you're kidding! - I'm not. It's only been a week! - A week? - That's right. Did it fall off? No. It can't just fall off by itself. You're right. It's gone. Told you. It was stolen again. How many is that? I stopped counting. Oh, no...I'll have to get Mori to do another one. So someone can steal it again? Who in the world wants to steal a nameplate? Because it sells for good money. It wasn't me! No, really! Where will you go today? To the pond. Oh, that's nice. I'll also burn some garbage. - You did it yesterday. - I'll do it again. But there's no garbage left to burn. Don't be silly. I can burn anything, like leaves... Here, I got you. You'll have a visitor today. Try to look respectable. I'm fine. But your hair...Why don't you comb it? You woke up like that... And so be it. I'll trim the back. For humans the back of the head is vulnerable. Right. It's nice to have long hair there to protect it. Oh, that's how it works! There, 1,2, 3, 4 and 5. Your turn. Off I go. See you later. Be careful. Were you here yesterday? Hey there. Where did you fly from? Where am I...? What's wrong? The pond is so far. Good luck, Dear. See you later. Be careful. The phone! - The phone's ringing. - Coming! - Hi, you two. - Hi. Hello. Kumagai residence. Mr. Kadota? Yes. Right. - A saucer? - Yes! You are welcome to drop in but Mori has an afternoon nap so come in the morning. I know they have fried dough cakes. In the morning. I'll use the toilet! Go ahead! Sorry about that. Tomorrow's good. How about you? Over there! OK, I'll see you tomorrow then. Thank you for calling, Mr. Kadota. - Any cake? - I found peanuts. That'll do. - No cakes. - What? I'll look. - I did. - Oh. I got you a melon! Melon! That's nice. And meat from Jizodo butcher. Mori's favorite! Have sukiyaki tonight. I'll have tea, too. Hello! - Gas meter reader! - Thank you! It must be hard having so many visitors! Yeah, one after the other. Including you! Hello! Is anyone home? Coming! Here's another one. Oh, ouch...ll have a cramp. - What? - A cramp! A cramp? Stretch it. Auntie, we have a visitor! Stretch it...From the knee. He's early. Come in! Hello! Good morning! Come right in. Just keep walking along there. - Give the guest some iced tea, Mie. - OK, ouch... No, the opposite way! Come into the drawing room from the porch. Thank you. All I want is 3 calligraphy characters. Uh, right. Your husband can name the price he wants for each character. But he only writes or paints what he likes. Can you talk to him? It's not that easy. If we had a sign written by Morikazu Kumagai visitors would come from everywhere to stay at our inn. See this? Un sui kan. These characters mean cloud water inn. Just these 3 characters. I guess it won't hurt to ask him. I appreciate it. Excuse me. You a dealer, too? You startled me... You want to buy his paintings? No, I...uh... OK, whatever! Don't go in there! Don't act like children, you two! Sorry to keep you. Mori says he's busy now. I'm very sorry. But he's there! He's observing the rice fish now. He can't be disturbed. He's watching an insect. What a predicament... I know how you feel. I came all the way from Shinshu. Oh well, I guess I can't persuade him. Sir. Psst! - From Shinshu? - Yes. Shinshu, you said? Yes. I'll be right back. Stay where you are! Mori, Dear. ...the poor man came so far. He looked at me! He says he'll do it. He stood up! I'll get him set up. Wait there. He's coming! He's coming this way! May I help you? You traveled a great distance to see me. I'm Asahina. I own an inn in Shinshu. It's an honor to meet you. Where in Shinshu? - Tateshina. - Ah, a nice place. I was born in Tsukechi in Gifu prefecture. Yes, I know all about you. Should I change? Sorry? Into clean clothes? No, you're fine as you are. Are you sure? - When will you return? - After this. Good heavens! I'll get a brush. OK. Oh, hello. You're very lucky! Am I missing something? He doesn't know about bullet trains. What? He thinks you traveled for days to get here. Oh, right... Thank you for your help. Thank you. It's from a local cypress tree. Must be expensive! Look how dense it is! And the aroma... I prepared the best board especially for you. - It's sealed? - With clay powder? Certainly. Whoever you are, be grateful. You owe Mori for life. I understand that. I can't watch this... You're a master! Don't waste your art on a stranger. I can't watch that happen... I don't mean to be rude but I'm going. - Move! - What the...? Who was he? I don't know. You shouldn't let strangers in! Right! Well... Who are you? If we could please get started...? Okay. It's all up to you now, sir. Cloud water inn. That way? Wait... "No one thing"...? No, One, Thing. Buddha's word for emptiness. The Sensei loves these words. Excuse me. Have a nice trip. I warned you, didn't 1?2? But this isn't... You could change your inn's name to Emptiness. Good idea. That'll work. Empty Inn. Do that. Oh, please... "Save Mori Kumagai's art" "from Land Developers!” "No condominiums!” "His garden nurtures art" "Don't let a condo destroy art!" - There's no space. - It's too close. Further apart. More. Mori, can you make a nameplate? If nameplates sell for good money we could make a living by selling them. That's a good idea. Why not have one of these yummy buns now? They do look good... You'll gorge yourself later. No, I'll resist them now and later. "Morikazu Kumagai” Are you putting a hex on someone? We'll give up if this one's stolen. Hello. Good morning. Is it that time? I brought along my assistant today. Uh...I'm Kashima. I'm Mori Kumagai. What do you think you're doing? Insect repellant? Yes. Why do you have it? You said there'd be many insects... And you brought along spray? I hate bugs... What? You wanna leave? Sorry. I'll be OK. What's this? A map of the property. Wow... It's so detailed. It took me half a year. What are the numbers? His favorite spots to sit. There are 14 spots. A tree stump. A barrel. He has a footrest. An upside down flowerpot. There's quite a variety. They're called "the wood spirit's chairs." By who? Amazing. What is? He looks like a Chinese hermit sage. Don't tell him that. He hates that! - You called him the wood spirit... - Go away! OK, sorry... Out of my way! What the hell! Fujita. What? It's a giant mantis! Stay here and watch. Sorry... No photos? I only have so much film. Will he ever paint pictures? No, he won't. What? He only paints at night. What's he doing now? He's watching a stone. He moved! Fujita. What was that? He moved the stone and he'll watch it again. Why...? I've no idea! Fujita. Yes? I noticed something recently... What? Ants... Their first step begins with the middle left foot. Middle left foot? Take a good look. Can you see it? Uh...I don't know... Watch carefully. I see what you mean... or maybe not. But I almost do... OK, I can't tell. Watch carefully. Oh, my eyes... Your turn. Me? Well? They're too fast. Keep watching. Watch! He's amazing. Isn't he bored...? For 30 years... What? He hasn't left this garden for 30 years. A genuine wood spirit or hermit sage... You're right. I look like a bear. A bear? I don't like this photo. But it's a really good one. Look at my elbow exposed like that! It's indecent having your elbow like this! It's not like me to be so indecent. How about this one? Fujita! You always look for moments where we look close. Oh, do 1? Is there anything to burn? Here! No! Give me a break. She looks like a hag. It's good. "Morikazu Kumagai” I'm really sorry. People take advantage of you being our neighbor. I just couldn't refuse... What? Oh... "94 years old" You sure? It's too much! It's OK. My age is my trade. Hello! The man from Jizodo...! The butcher. - Here's some nice meat. - Thank you! - Steaks. - Thank you! - Come in for some tea! - No, thank you. - Come on! - I have to go! Tell me something saucy, beefy man. You make me jealous with that hot BBQ sauce. It's on! - This is it! - Where is it? For 30 years this man hasn't left the boundaries of his backyard. In his backyard he observes all living things. Morikazu Kumagai, A Man Above Earthly Concerns Morikazu Kumagai is one of Japan's most talented painters today. The time he spends in this overgrown garden inspires his art. He has no interest in money and fame. He gives his undivided attention to his art. His empathic worldview produces many paintings. His daily routine includes making a fire. You like making fires? Yes, I burn things every day. He's known as the hermit sage of art. I didn't know you were a hermit sage! You know Harada, the one I swim with? She said she saw Mori on the street. - Really? - No! I think I saw him outside too... Mori, didn't I see you on a bike? No way! Impossible! Who was it then? Because you hardly go out it became a topic of discussion. If that's so, you should go out even less. It adds to your image! Don't you want to watch? "Save Mori Kumagai's art from Land Developers!” Nice smell. Someone's coming. - Is my husband here? - Yes. I cooked too much curry so... - We just cooked noodles! - Oh, too bad! Won't you eat it? It's too much! What should we do? You know, do that so that... What do you mean? What will we do? It's no problem... What happened to Baldy Chu? Did he quit? I loved him! - Who is he? - A comedian. Arai Chu. They don't watch The Drifters Show. I guess not. - Now it's Shimura Ken. - That's right! I like Ken. He has a good face. Ikariya is better. Is that a joke? I love Kato Cha. Takagi Boo is my favorite. - Boo? - It's a name. - Who? - Another comedian. - I'll go get a towel. - It's OK, I'll go. I bet Nakamoto Koji was a gymnast like I was. What do you mean? His poses are too good for an amateur. Poses? At the end of their gymnastic comedy routine. - Can you tell? - A gymnast? You? Yes! I got a cramp! Are you OK? Stretch her leg. Can you answer it? You spilt some on your collar. Hello, this is the Kumagai residence. Your collar. Oh, really. I'll ask my husband. Mori, Dear. It's about persons of cultural merit... The Government wants to give you a badge of the Order of Culture. The Order of Culture! Amazing! You want it? No. I get enough visitors already... You have a point. And I don't like formal attire... Sorry to keep you waiting. He says he doesn't want it. Listen. Do not mix curry with noodles. I didn't do it. I'll be back by evening! OK! Have a nice time! I still can't see it. You know. I think photographers are like dogs. Dogs? You look up and down and get on your stomach. It's funny. You think so? Sensei. I keep having the same bad dream recently. You say in my dream, "You're not a good photographer!” I don't want to be in your dream. - Fujita? - What? You going tomorrow? What if I am? Well... Can I come too? Wear long trousers. Sure. Coming. Yes? I'm Mizushima. It's my condo going up over there. He's the foreman. Iwatani. Is your husband home? I'm afraid not. He's gone out. When's he back? I don't know... It's possible that he won't come home today. Now that is a problem. Yes, when he goes out you never know... Then I'll speak with you. Oh, I know nothing. There's the pig behind you. Pig? Now... Yes. There's something we need to discuss. Yes. Recently strange signs have been put up around your house. Oh, what signs...? About culture, and art...and stuff. They bother us. It makes us look like bad guys. Oh, but let me explain. The young artists took it upon themselves to make those signs. I want you to talk to them. The condo construction is going ahead. But, sir. You never mentioned that your condo would block the sun. Huh? Once it's built our garden will be in the shade. There are many plants in the garden. Many insects live here too. Insects? Yes, insects and cats and birds. Are you serious? The garden... It's everything to my husband. Anyway... if you don't remove the signs we'll have to resort to legal action. Legal action? - We'll sue you. - What? We'll sue you. You can tell them yourself! You're making a big drama... Yes? Where is the toilet? Down there, at the end of the hall. Thank you. I won't be long. It's OK... Go ahead. Sir? Yes? Mr. Kumagai? No. I know your face. I saw you on TV. Excuse me. I knew she was lying... You haven't left home for 6 decades or so... I'm sorry. No, please. There's something I want you to look at, sir. Huh? Sorry... My son, Masaru, drew this. He says they're typhoons. Oh, really. Yes, all sorts of typhoons. I see... And my wife started to wonder if Masaru is some kind of genius. I told her about you and she wanted me to show it to you. Oh, really. Art isn't my thing. I'd be happy as long as Masaru got better at baseball. What do you think, sir? If Masaru turned out to be a genius we'd need to reconsider what schools to send him to... He's bad. He is bad. It's OK to be bad. Uh, is that a good thing? The talented ones don't go far. It's bad, but it's still art. It's bad but it's art... I see. 20 more seconds for kick practice! You can do it! I got a cramp! Help me, Harada! Mie! Are you OK? Give me a break! It hurts! Coach! Coach, help me! Thank you for coming. She wasn't very welcoming. Mori, Dear. They've gone. Good. You ask why do the crows caw? They caw, "Mind your own business.” Every day many visitors come. Things can get hectic. Right. - You know. - Yes? This here... I'm thinking of filling it up. Really? You want to? Yes. All that work! When the condo is built this will be the only sunny spot. But you dug it out yourself and it took ages... Well, I guess it's inevitable. But how will you fill such a big hole? Well, I have an idea. Sir! Oh, my! This is some hole...! I'd say it would take 15 truckloads to fill it up. That much! This is some hole you dug! Well, it took 30 years. What? I began digging when we moved here. It rained and groundwater filled the hole. I put fish in there from the nearby Shakujii river. Then I didn't want the hole to dry up. So I kept digging. And this is what I ended up with. Can I go down there? Go on. Amazing! There are fish here! What will you do when the condo's built? You're building it! I know. Why don't you keep the fish? What? You're the builder so take responsibility. That way your son can draw the fish. OK, I'll trade the dirt for the fish. It's a deal. Seal it with a clap. One, two, three... I'm back! Did you get thin? Hi, I'm back. I couldn't help it. 1 got hungry after swimming... What will we do with all this meat? We'll invite people over. Young people. Young people? - Hungry ones. - Hungry and... Single. - Single? - Yes. Single! Watch out, it's hot! Here are the vegetables! Juice or beer? Beer! Over there! Hey! Oh...! It's you! We met this morning. Join us for some meat. Mori. The hole is now connected to the universe. Oh, really. Join me. What? It's time you escape this garden. Don't you want to explore the universe? Come! Let's go! No. No, thank you. I will stay here. Why? This garden is more than big enough for me. It's all I can handle. If I went away my wife would get exhausted again. I can't let her go through that. OK then. You woke up. The guests... They went home a while ago. Oh, really. Everyone ate so much! It's been quite a busy day. I'll make tea. You're like a soldier. Pardon? You just think about winning. I don't. It's just that you happen to be a bad player. Suppose... Yes? Suppose you could live your life again... Would you like it? I would... hate it. Why? It'd be very tiring! How about you? I wouldn't mind living it over and over. I want to live this life longer. Oh, really. I love living my life. Oh, really... We've lived so long... And we lost some of our kids so young... OK, let's play again. No. I think you ought to get ready for school now. You're right. Come now. I envy the lucky ones who don't go to school... Come now. - You're kidding! - No. Tell me you're joking! It's not me! - Oh please, no! - 1 didn't do it. It's not me. You understand? Take it easy. Are you single? Huh? "Condos to let" That's huge. Fujita! Whoa, look at that... Mori, Dear? You have a visitor! Mori, Dear?
