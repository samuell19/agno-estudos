[CHILDREN CHATTERING AND YELLING] [♪♪♪] Don't. Is this working for you, this collision course we're on? Trevor, ah, why is what you did bad? Because it makes you look like an asshole. That's right. It makes Mr. Collins look like a complete asshole. Yeah, it does. Right. Exactly. Mm-hmm. Okay, you know what? Fuck you, man. Honestly, I really don't have it in me to play games with you today. Trevor, I need you to promise me that you will not throw a ball in my face again and we can move on from this. I just, uh, I need to hear you say that. Go ahead. Whenever you're ready. Here's the thing. I can't promise you that. Wow. I think we're done here. TREVOR: You look like shit. I know. Thank you. What's up with you? Um, I'm pretty sure my wife is leaving me, Trevor. Well, did you try writing her a poem? That's what I did when I was dating Paige. It was like: What's your wife's name? Lauren. Oh, so, like: L is for lady, A is for aweso-- I'm not gonna write her a poem. It's stupid. Aren't you a writer? Ah, not anymore. Why? Just gave up on it. Why? It didn't work out. Why not? Because I was foolish enough to chase a dream. And now I'm, you know, your fucking teacher. You know what helped me when Paige and I broke up? What? Shel Silverstein. Great. You should get into him. Thank you. I-- Maybe. Please leave now. [SIGHS] Trevor, don't! [ALL CHATTERING] Mr. Collins? Yes. Brittany, what is it? I'm Paige. Is there a Brittany in this class? No. How may I help you, Paige? Do you have any super glue? Yeah, top drawer. Oh, wait. Don't use all of it. Mr. Collins? Uh, yes? Can I scoop the fish out of the fish tank? Yeah, yeah, go for it. Mr. Collins? Ah, Jesus. Yes? Can I go on the roof? Uh, yeah, but let me make an announcement first, okay? Hey, guys? Guys? Uh, I really need to focus right now on this poem that I'm writing to sort of let my wife know where I am mentally so I can try to win her back. Um, and the constant distractions are incredibly distracting. So for the rest of class, if you have a question for me, just, uh, yes. The answer is yes. All right? Enjoy the roof. [ALL CHEERING AND CHATTERING] That is so pretty. GIRL: Thank you. I drew a picture of you, Ms. Abigail. Oh, let's see. It's beautiful. Let's hang it on the Rope of Friendship. Matt? Hey, Ms. Abigail. What are you doing out there? Just hanging out. Where are your clothes? On the roof. I-- Okay. What? [ALL CHATTERING] Hi, Ethan. Uh, I don't mean to interrupt your lesson, but, um, Matt wandered off, so I brought him back. He left his clothes on the roof, but I couldn't find them so I just got him something out of Lost and Found. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Also, your fish had gotten out. Uh, I found them flopping around in the hallway. One of them was super glued to the floor so he didn't make it. Okay. Are you okay? Let's say, yes. Oh, also, don't forget to answer Hannah's e-mail about the faculty luncheon. It's in regards to your sandwich preferences. Spoiler alert, I picked portobello. Which one is Hannah? Assistant Principal Hannah Gruber. Oh, well, just say that, then, Abby. How did the SAKS test go? Oh, shit. When was I supposed to give that out? Today. ETHAN: All right, guys. We only have four minutes to take this test. So, uh, let's just focus really hard. And now we actually have, uh, less than four minutes. Really? I thought we had the whole day. They changed the rules. The test you're about to take is the Statewide Assessment of Knowledge and Skills test. You will have six hours to comp, uh-- We'll just skip that, it's not important. Um... In fact, uh, the answer to question one is D. Yeah. So let's just all go ahead and mark the right answer, which is D. That's the right answer there. Question two is A. Question three is C. Mr. Collins, you never turned in your SAKS tests. We are actually, uh, still working on it. Why? Uh, we just got a late start. Why did you get a late start? Um, it was just due to, you know, the lateness, um, of the time of which we started, which was incredibly late. Save it. Let's pick up the tests. [♪♪♪] Did you get my e-mail about the faculty luncheon? Mr. Coll-- Mr. Collins? Excuse me. ALL [IN UNISON]: Chug! Chug! Chug! [ALL CHATTERING AND CHEERING] BOY 1: Yeah, boy! BOY 2: Yeah! [INDISTINCT MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO] All right. Thanks, dude. Be good. Mr. Collins. Hannah. What are you doing? I was talking to you. I didn't know your first name was Hannah. Did you get my e-mail asking your preferences for the faculty luncheon? I have an e-mail account? We have the McCallister parent-teacher conference tomorrow. And I need you on your absolute A-game. If she sues the school again-- Great, see you tomorrow. [♪♪♪] Do you have any sevens? [INDISTINCT MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Lauren? Lauren. Sorry. What? Sevens, do you have any sevens? Oh, Uh... No, sorry. Go fish. [SIGHS] Hey, Lauren? I said, go fish. No, I heard you. It's not that. Is everything okay? How's everything with Ethan? It's not good, guys. You wanna talk about it? Oh, no. This is the one place I can go to get away from everything so, honestly, I don't even wanna think about Ethan when I'm here. Ethan? Hey, Lauren. Hey, guys. Hey. What's up, buddy? Ethan. Can we talk later? No, wait. Please, this is important. You remember how, in college, we used to lock my roommates out and have sex to Depeche Mode? Uh, of course I do. And we used to listen to "Enjoy The Silence" on repeat, just over and over and over again? Yeah. ETHAN: Well... All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here on my arm. Whoa! Damn. Oh, my God. Ethan, that song is about heroin. Okay. Obviously, I didn't mean to refer to heroin. Um, can you guys give us just one minute? Yeah, yeah, no problem. Of course. MAN: Real sorry, Ethan. Seriously? Ethan. ETHAN: What? Uh... Ethan, it's over. You have to hear me. It's... It's over. Look, if it's because of the tattoo, I... I can't return it or anything. Lauren, this is ridiculous. I was reading your letter again this morning. And I know things have been fucked up between us for a long time, but I think-- Ethan, I met someone. What? It's really over. [ALARM WAILING] [ALL CHATTERING] ♪Make a drawing Where does it go?♪ ♪Look around the room Because we all know♪ ♪It's the Rope of Friendship It's the color blue♪ ♪ A special place to hang me And you ♪ [♪♪♪] Ethan? Ethan. Huh? Oh, no. I think you have a parent-teacher conference. Yes, thank you. I'm just wrapping up over here. Did you sleep in your car? No. Are you being sarcastic? No. Are you? Yes. Oh, my God. Did you get a tattoo? No. Okay. Do you know where the meeting is? In Hannah's office. I can try to buy you a few minutes if you need a little time-- Oh, oh. [VOMITING] That's okay. That's okay. That's okay. I'll go get the Too Much Lunch bucket. He needs to go. All right, let's... Let's pump the brake before we make a mistake. Last week, I asked my son what he was learning and he said that "nothing lasts forever." And he's swearing now. Where is that coming from? And when I picked him up yesterday, he was wearing someone else's clothes. Mrs. McCallister, I explained to you, his clothes were on the roof. Yes. Why? He took them off on the roof. Why? Well, you make a good point. Why don't we ask Matt? Do not say anything. Your lawyer will speak for you. Please, let's not go down that road again. You know the old saying, sue the school four times, stop suing the school. Mm-hmm. Just fire him like you fired the others. I would love to fire him, but I cannot. He has tenure. Does tenure protect a teacher who falls asleep during a parent-teacher conference? I honestly can't answer that. He's asleep right now. Oh. Mm-hmm? See? Yes. Whose turn is it? Oh, I'm sorry. Are we boring you? Heh, what do you mean? The thing you were saying about your kid. Oh, who's my kid? I'm gonna go with... I mean, what's his name? [MOUTHING] Matt. Matt. Math. [BLOWS AIR] Really? Okay. Let me make myself perfectly clear here. I am not going to let that man stand in the way of my son getting into Pebble Path Middle School. So you can either find a way to fire him or I can find someone who will fire you. Come on, Matt. Matt! I was gonna say Matt. WOMAN: Hmm. ETHAN: I was gonna say Matt. I smell booze but that's all I'm saying. Maybe it's Matt. I was seriously gonna say Matt. What the hell is wrong with you? My, uh... My wife left me. I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Collins, but I'm putting you on notice. As per Union bylaws, I am ordering you to see the school therapist and I am pursuing the termination of your contract with this school. She's gone. What? She's really gone. Yes. Have you listened to anything I said? Yeah, therapist. Got it. You know how they say, um, "Those who can't do, teach"? Right? You've heard that. Uh, my dad used to say that to me all the time. Just to fuck with me. And even though I knew, like, rationally, that he's just an asshole, whatever, he was just sort of always there. Uh, then when I became a teacher, um, I was thinking... You know, I started wondering, is Lauren thinking that about me? Am I, you know, can I not do? Um... And, I mean, when I gave up on writing, that's like-- I just felt like the biggest failure in the world. And I felt like she felt that about me and... For the first few months after I was a teacher, Lauren and I couldn't even have sex. I just couldn't-- Like, it wasn't... It wasn't happening for me, you know. I just didn't have, you know... I was trying but it just couldn't happen. Um... And I'm gonna be completely honest with you, just because I promised I would be. Um, I'm starting to think maybe there's no point to anything and... Hey, Andrew. Dude, I mean, I'm kind of in the middle of some heavy shit. Is there something you wanna share with the whole class or? You said you wanted to be a writer more than anything. Right. Then you just gave up on it. Go on. Maybe the Lauren problem is bigger than Lauren. Holy shit. Andrew, that's a great point, but I wanna come back to that. Can you remind me? And we'll come back to it? Um, let's shift gears for a second. What is, uh, this? Let's talk about this. What is settling? Settling in life, what is that? Oh, no, you don't have to raise your hands. We don't have time for hands. Just spit it out as it comes to you. Cool, we'll do hands, yeah. No wrong answers. The pilgrims settled here. Wrong answer. Anybody else? Yeah, Matt. Hit me. Is it a fruit? A fruit? A fruit. No, dude. Settling's not a fruit. Is it pooping your pants? [ALL LAUGH] No, it isn't, Trevor. Why? Did you poop your pants again? [ALL CHEERING] Takes one to know one. Heh, uh, really? Because you, um... What's wrong? Poop in your mouth? [CHEERING CONTINUES] It has nothing to do with poop, guys. Let's move on. Where's the pen? What--? Trevor, bring that over here. No. Well, I'm not walking over there. Aren't you? [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [ALL LAUGH] Marriage. Is marriage... an antiquated notion? My mommy and daddy are married. Yeah, for now. Do you know what I mean? Let me tell you what I'm realizing here. If there is one thing you can take away from our time together-- Strike two. It's this. Don't ever commit yourself to another person, ever. [SCOFFS] Let's write that down. I guess what I'm really trying to say is that, um, sometimes mommies lie to daddies. Uh, I'm not saying your mommies are liars. Just, you know, some of them are, probably. [DOOR OPENS] Hey, kids. What are we learning about today? ALL [IN UNISON]: Mommies are liars. Wow. Great. Well, if you let your parents know about that tonight, also make sure to let them know that the views expressed by Mr. Collins do not necessarily reflect the opinions of this school and we take no responsibility for his statements, okay? Mr. Collins, could I have a word with you outside? Well, I'm in the middle of teaching my class, so not really. Are you F-U-C-K-ing with me right now? You know they can spell, right? Get outside! ALL [IN UNISON]: Ooh! Guys, let's just play it cool. We got this. Look, I think I can safely say that I trust everyone in the room. I trust Paige, I trust Andrew, I trust, you know-- What's his name back there? Buddy? If there's something you wanna say, just say it. I made you an appointment with the therapist and you never showed up. Well, I mean, I totally forgot, and I'm really, really, really sorry. Stop undermining me, Mr. Collins. You're always undermining me. This is just like the faculty luncheon e-mail. The faculty luncheon e-mail? That's still on your mind? That's still a concern of your? How dare you. You know what? I didn't wanna have to do this-- Oh, no, no. No. Can't fire me. Tenure. Not yet. But I can do something almost as bad. Hold on. Think about what you're doing. Mr. Collins, I'm officially naming you... Please don't. That's not necessary. ...director of this year's school play! [ALL APPLAUDING] You witch. What?! What are you trying to do? I am assistant principal. You don't think I have enough on my plate? Why didn't you answer my luncheon e-mail? You know what? Have fun directing the play. Send it to my inbox so I can not answer it! Don't blame me if you get a sandwich you don't like! Get the fuck out of here! [GRUNTING AND PANTING] He is not worth it, ma'am. He's not worth it. You get the school attorney down here now! [♪♪♪] Yeah. So I just called Google, and they won't take the pictures down. Why are you showing me this? What do you want me to do with it? Well, your husband's a doctor, so-- [PHONE RINGS] The school attorney is here. Send him in. [SIGHS] All right. Go. I went over Mr. Collins' file. He has tenure. He does. From this school. Unfortunately. Has he slept with any students? What? So that's a no? That's a no. You could get the entire school board to vote him out. But it needs to be unanimous. And they haven't agreed on anything since 1987. Oh, I'll find a way to make it unanimous. No, I don't think so. No, but I think I'll find a way. You know? No, probably not. You could assign him the school play as a punishment. I already did that. Hmm. You know what you could do. Listen, guys, I know we're all probably thinking the same thing. "It's 3:00. What the hell am I doing here?" Um, you're all here because we were not allowed to have auditions, which is fine. And I'm here because I'm being punished. So let's all just kind of band together and get through this. Okay? You know, if I have any word of advice at the top here, it's, uh, speak the speech. We don't really know who these characters are yet. Um, maybe just bring a little piece of yourself into it. And we'll have a wonderful time discovering them together. Whenever you're ready, Zach. "Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. They lived happily--" Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. Um, it's missing something. It's missing some conviction. Maybe... Okay, I don't wanna give you a line read here, but, you know, "Once upon a time." "Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. They lived happily in their three little homes." "My house is made of straw. And that's all I need." What? It says that? That sucks. "My house is made out of sticks. That makes me happy." No. No, no, no. Hold on. Let me just see that. Holy Lord. This script is awful. I mean, my God. Okay, you know what, let's just call that Day One. So good rehearsal, everyone. See you tomorrow, Mr. Collins. Yeah. Maybe. [♪♪♪] [ALL CHATTERING] ♪ She kinda looks like me ♪ ♪ Instead of climbing trees ♪ Why, if it isn't Madame Jennifer. Ah, the Pied Peter. [IMITATES FLUTE] Ah, Captain Morgan. Good day to you, matey. Chairman Mao-llary. [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Abigail, can I have a moment? Yes, absolutely. I'm supposed to observe your class today. That's right. We're all ready for you. I'm gonna have to reschedule. How's next Tuesday? Oh, next Tuesday is great. Um, is everything okay? Everything is fine. We just have something more urgent to attend to. Hmm, yes, it looks like Mr. Collins's tenure is looking a little "tenurous." What? Is that not a word? Shut up. Definitely. See you next Tuesday. Yeah, we'll see you then. Guy's wife leaves him, thinks he can F me in the A. No, sirree. [♪♪♪] Hi, Ethan. What's going on with you? What happened? My wife left me. I know. I heard. I'm so sorry. You know? Wait. Why'd you ask me what happened? I don't... How are you doing with that? Well, there's another guy in the picture. Oh, I am so sorry. Yeah, me too. I, uh... I've been fantasizing about hunting him down and killing him slowly, but, knowing Lauren, he's probably a really good gu. What? I think Gruber is planning a surprise observation of your class this afternoon. What? Really? This afternoon? Yes. Soon, probably. How do you know? Just by the way she was acting earlier. I have to go prepare. Um... Why'd you tell me? Thanks. Thank you. Um, all right, guys, recess is over early. We gotta go prepare for something. Paige! Trevor! Where are you guys? I don't think your class has recess right now. What? Shit! [ALL CHATTERING] [PANTING] You guys are all in here. I thought you were at recess. Man, you know, maybe I really am a bad teacher. Okay, there's no time for that now. Guys, I gotta ask you something, okay? Do you want rules to come back? ALL [IN UNISON]: No! Right? Um... And you like being treated respectfully, like adults? ALL [IN UNISON]: Yes! Of course! Okay. So listen up. [♪♪♪] How's that? Tighter. Is that right? Yup. Zach, buddy, don't wipe that off, man. We don't have time to re-do it, okay? All right. Paige, you're good to go. Did you clear the Internet histories? Yup. Okay. Trevor. Where's Trevor? I need Trevor. Trevor. Trevor, come here. Listen, buddy. I need your help. I wouldn't be doing this unless it was an emergency. I'm coming to you with my hat in my hand. Okay. You're the only one who can pull this off. I need you to be my Code Red. What does that mean? Well, why me? Honestly, dude? You're unusually sneaky for a child. I'll do it for 50 bucks. Fifty? Twenty. What is that? Peanut butter? Yeah. Here we go. It looks like his days are tenured. That's what I should have said earlier. What? Enough. Stop it. Yeah. I'm sorry. Are you ready? Let's nail this GD A-hole. Yes? May I help you? Yes, Mr. Collins, I was-- What are you doing here? Get out of here. Go answer my phones. Right away. Sorry to drop in on you like this, Mr. Collins, but I'd like to sit in and observe your class. Yeah, absolutely. There's a seat next to Trevor. Go right ahead. Okay, guys, we're gonna continue to review yesterday's lesson, all right? Let's see here. Hey, Holly. In order to defray the cost of keeping troops in America, what did the British Parliament enact and when? HOLLY: The Stamp Act of 1765. Good, but do you think you could be more specific? Sorry, Mr. Collins. March 22nd, 1765. Very nice. Great. Thank you. Oh, you know what, guys, this next one is a Free For Al! [ALL CHEERING] Oh, man. Okay, here it is. March 18th, 1766! I knew you guys would know this one, just because we've been working so hard and sticking to the school-assigned lesson pla. Cool. March 18th, 1766. Zach, who are we talking about? The British Parliament. Absolutely. And what did they do? Paige? Repealed the Stamp Act. Yes, they did. What did they issue in its place? Hit it out of the park for me, Mark-- Matt. The Declaratory Act. ETHAN: Give yourselves a round of applause. How about that? That was... That was good. Gosh, you know, you guys love to learn. It's inspiring. I think you've all earned some school-approved, gluten-free, sugarless fruit chewies. Here's one for you. Careful. Paige, I think you've earned yours. Trevor, you don't need any more sugar. Hannah-- I mean, Holly. Camille, Zach, uh, Buddy. Grumpy face over there. All right. Moving right along. The Townshend Acts of 1767. Camille. Mr. Collins, could I ask the kids some questions? Um... I'll stay in your lesson plan. Yeah. Absolutely. Um, I think that would be fun for everyone. Uh, oh, I'm so sorry, Trevor. Did you have a question? What? No. Are you sure? Oh, yes. Can I go to the bathroom? Code Red. Code Red. You can just say number two, Trevor. Take the pass. And, uh, where were we? Right. Assistant Principal Gruber, you were going to ask a few questions. Yes, I was. Let's start with an easy one. Who can tell me what two countries fought in the Revolutionary War, huh? Anybody? Hey, Ms. Moore. Don't mind me. Just going to poop. Anyone? You seem to know a lot. Anyone at all? [FIRE ALARM WAILING] Oh, my God. Fire! Guys, that means fire. That's bad. We gotta leave. Fire's bad. We gotta leave. Whoa, just one second, kids! No, no, no. Come on, guys. We don't wanna get burned. How dare you stall them during a fire alarm? Honestly. I have half a mind to report you for this. [ALL YELLING] False alarm. Someone may have pulled it. Little turds. Don't look at me like that. You don't know them. You guys were incredible, seriously. And I'm sorry about those shitty snacks. I'll get you great snacks. What are you looking for, Mr. Collins? Well, someone I know might be here. Who? A firefighter, Holly. A firefighter that Mr. Collins loves very much. Did everybody make it out okay? Yeah, we're safe. Thanks. Good. Abby, seriously, thank you. I don't think you deserve to be fired. Well, that's debatable. I'm so sorry. Lauren's over there. I gotta talk to her. Yeah, of course. ETHAN: Thanks again! Hey. Ethan. Hey. I, uh, thought I might see you here. Ha. Yeah. Yeah. So how's... How's the tattoo? Uh, well, it's still there. [CHUCKLES] You know, I haven't figured out what to change "Lauren" to yet, though. How are you? Well, they've ordered me to direct the school play so, you know, not fantastic. I meant, how are you holding up with everything? Oh. You know. Uh, you know. You know. You know. You know, you know, you know. You know? How's, um... How's everything with you? How's the, uh, the new guy? Oh, uh... That's over. Really? Yeah. I realized it was a little soon to jump into something, so... Oh. But that doesn't change anything between us, Ethan, you know, because our problems were... Well, they were our problems. Right. I would love to come see the school play. Really? You would? Yeah, totally. That would be amazing. Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Um, yes. I'll forward you the details. I'll send you the details. Yeah, send me the details. I'll send you all the details. We just gotta figure out, like, location, uh, time, date, stuff like that. Location's probably gonna be the big auditorium. Just gotta lock that down. Thinking maybe having a month of rehearsal or something. But then we'll, you know. We'll... As soon as the details are solidified, I can send you the details. You'll have them. You'll have the details and you can come to the play. Okay. Okay. Bye, Ethan. Hey, how'd I do with Code Red? Uh, well, saying Code Red out loud wasn't ideal. But you did great. I know you don't like me, Trevor. But you really saved my ass. You're a man of your word. Thank you. [♪♪♪] All right, where are you guys? There you are. Listen. Take, uh, your scripts out of your binders. Out. Take them out. Now hold them up. Hold them up. Yeah. And tear them up. Go ahead. Tear them up. I'm telling you. Yes, sir! Let's-- Okay, no, you know, that's okay. I'll just get scissors later or something. Actually, that's good paper. Guys, we shouldn't waste that. We'll make it scrap paper. Okay. Listen, guys, I think we all agreed during our last rehearsal that this play kind of sucks the big one. Uh, the characters' expectations for their happiness are unrealistic and over-simplified. And the language. Snooze fest. Am I right? Uh, so that, uh, combined with the knowledge that someone very special is going to be in the audience has actually inspired me to write a new play. So we're not doing the three little pigs and the wolf? Sort of. Um, we're going to do the two little pigs and no wolf. And ,uh, also, the pigs are not pigs. So who are we playing? That is a great question, Joey. You, sir, will be assuming the role of Ethan Collins. That's me. Whoa. Paige, you'll be playing the role of Lauren, my wife. I thought she was your ex-wife. Not yet. Zach, you will remain narrator. Okay? And, uh, Holly, you'll be assuming the role of mother-in-law. So there's no wolf? Oh, no, there's still a wolf. Um, but from now on, we're gonna refer to him as "home wrecker." Okay? Who is he? He's the villain. [♪♪♪] Can we talk? Uh, sure. Talk. Alone. Can we have a minute? [SIGHS] What do you got there, huh? Some ants on a log? Yeah, what of it? Do you like candy? Of course I do. I don't know anyone who doesn't like candy. Well, then, I'll just get right to the point, then. Yeah. Now, there is a lot more where that came from. Okay. Can you sit somewhere else? No. I never said that you were, Lauren. But it's hard for me when you point out yet another thing we can't afford on my teacher's salary. Ugh, okay, Joey, I just wanna take that line again. Mm-hmm. Do you need her to lead you into it? Yeah. Okay, Paige. I'm not trying to-- Emasculate. I'm not trying to emasculate you, Ethan. Uh, Paige, actually, let's change that. Okay, we're gonna make it, um, "I'm not always trying to emasculate you, Ethan." Just add "always." Okay, Joey, sorry. Whenever you're ready. I never said that you were, Lauren. But it's hard for me we can't afford on my teacher's salary. ZACH: That's the night the straw house collapsed. Lauren and E-- Zach, I'm so sorry. Um, Joey, I just wanna go back to that line again. And, uh, tsk, you know, let's give it another read. And this time, maybe, I don't know, believe it. Is that too much to ask? I thought I did it great. Okay, you thought so. But let's just try it again. I never said that you were, Lauren. But it's hard for me when you-- ETHAN: It's just, um... [CLICKING TONGUE] Um... Uh, it's just not... Not totally working for me right now. At all. Joey, do you wanna be an actor? Sure, I guess. Okay. Why? I don't know. You don't know? Then I don't know why I'm watching you. You're dismissed. Just leave your play on the way out. You think I need this, Collins? I'm out of here! See? I bought that. So am I back in? No. I'm sorry, it's not gonna work out. We need a new Ethan. [♪♪♪] You spoke to my assistant on the school bus yesterday. Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't. You know who I am? I have a filing cabinet filled with confiscated candy. It's yours if you want it. What's the catch? You're part of something much bigger now, Trevor. I want you to spy on Mr. Collins. How would I do that? ETHAN: Okay, guys, that last Gruber visit was a pretty close call. So we're gonna have to try to actually learn something. I'm sorry. Let's see. "It was our Founding Fathers who secured the Independence of, um, blah, blah, blah." [MUMBLING] Let's... Um, you know, I'm just gonna jump ahead here. The British whatnot-- Okay. You guys know that we used to belong to England? And then England got weird about it. Right? Did you know that? Can we skip that? Hey, Trevor, could you put your bag on the floor, please? Thank you. Um... So next up, we've got Thomas Jefferson. What's that? A tape recorder. Why do you have it? To record the lesson. Why? To help me with my homework. Fine. Yeah. Knock yourself out. Okay. Where was I? Um... Jefferson something? Thomas Jefferson. That's boring. We can skip that. Uh, okay. Uh, the Constitution. No one cares. Okay. Um, Civil War. No one cares. I did not mean it like that, Andrew. I care very much. Oh, you know what, here's actually-- This one's kind of interesting. Watergate. [♪♪♪] It was a... A wire-tapping scandal. Like a spying thing. The year was 1972. Took place in a hotel. The Watergate Hotel. President Richard Nixon was in office at the time. And everyone involved considered it an enormous and unforgivable betrayal. The country never recovered. You could say that all of our country's problems are due to Watergate. So I think this would be a good time to break out into discussion groups. And discuss the various lessons and interesting things that we reviewed this morning. So if you all don't mind, simply-- Okay, emergency recess. Come on, guys, get out of here. Let's go. Not you. You sit. [KIDS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Why not me? [SIGHS] Really, man? Really? Are you mad at me? Am I in trouble? Ugh, I'm not mad. Um, I'm just processing. I get it. Yeah. She shouldn't have put you in this position. So are we cool? Can I go to recess now? Yeah, we're cool. Go ahead. Wait, Trevor. Just one thing. That story you were giving me about recording the lesson for homework. You really sold it. I believed you. You can act. [♪♪♪] That's okay, I got that. I'll pay for her meal, please. Wow, thanks, Trevor. May I speak with you? Sure. Let's sit. So, what's up? So Collins wants me to do the play. Oh, that's great. He wants me to play your husband. Oh. I see. I guess I just wanted to say that I know our breakup was rough, but I really thought those three weeks together were really special and I'd be honored to act with you, I just wanted to see how you felt. Hmm. Well, I'm willing to be an adult about it if you are. What's that supposed to mean, Ethan? I'm tired of you bringing your mother into everything. Oh, grow up. I don't bring her into anythin. You bring her into the bedroom. PAIGE: She knew we wanted to get pregnant. She was just giving us advice. She was giving you advice because I couldn't get it up. Oh, baby, you know I don't care-- Paige, sorry, stop just for a second, um... Um... It's good, um... I just... I think maybe you're not totally grasping the stakes of the scene. I'm a vegan. Okay. That's okay. Yeah, let's take 10, everyone. You know that if you put this play up, you'll get fired, right? Hmm, maybe. But Lauren needs to see this. Do you really think that's gonna help anything? Ugh, I don't know. You know, I don't think I've ever told you this, but when I was in high school, my dream was to be a cheerleader. That's lame, I know. But that's what I wanted to be. I practiced my routine for over a year, and when I tried out as a freshman I didn't make the team. I was crushed. But you know what? I tried out again my sophomore year, and I didn't make it again. And as crushed as I was the first time, I mea, that second time was so much harder. So then my junior year, I try out-- And you didn't make it. Please don't ruin my story. Anyway, you're right. I didn't make it. But that was just really devastating. You know what my mom said to me? She said, "Honey, you're going to make it. So I try out again my senior year, my last year. And you made it. Oh, no, no, I didn't. Oh, okay. But a few weeks into the season, there was this bus crash and basically with half the team gone, they needed anyone they could get and I was available. So I got to cheer. I got to cheer my senior year. So now, Ethan, I'm telling you, "Honey, you're going to make it." What? So okay, let me just see if I can wrap my head around this. You got to cheer your senior year because half of the cheerleading team died in a bus crash? Oh. Oh, wow, yeah. I guess when you put it in those terms it's actually super depressing. You mean when I put it in the terms of exactly what happened. Yeah. And it's depressing for, like, five different reasons. Because your dreams were crushed. But a bunch of cheerleaders literally were crushed in a bus crash. Heh, do you feel any better? Yeah, I feel great now. No. No, I don't. What are you laughing about? Oh, no, no, no. I'm not laughing about the bus crash. I'm just laughing, ha, at my own complete obliviousness. You know? To how horrifying my inspirational story was. No, right, I get it. Mm. [BOTH LAUGH] Hey, maybe you have some things to work out. Hmm. Yeah. Maybe I should write a play. I would be horrified to see it. No. Mr. Collins? Yeah? Matt used the prop toilet. Oh, that's okay. Wait, one or two? Code Red. Shit. I have to go take care of this. Oh, I'll help you. [♪♪♪] Willy, get me the fax number for the school board. Which member? All of them.

So I'll see you at the meeting. We're gonna hold it right after the play. The entire school board is here to see the show. I know those meetings can be a drag, but don't worry, it'll be the last one you'll ever attend. Tenure your way out of this one. Ha! [♪♪♪] Chapter one, things fall apart. This... represents my life's work. This... is what it's worth now. Do you think this will get Ms. McCallister off our backs? Oh, Willy, grow up. This is so much bigger than McCallister. Oh. Make sure Collins doesn't leave the building. I can't hold this up on my own, Ethan. I need your help. I know, baby. I know. I just had this idea, and I'm trying to remember what it was. As soon as I find it, I'll help you. This is falling! I need you now! Hold on, Lauren. Just give me one minute. Giving up on a dream doesn't make you a loser, Ethan. But giving up on me, giving up on us, that makes you a loser. TREVOR: Just one more minute, baby. PAIGE: I'm gonna find someone else. Someone who gives a shit. Lauren, just wait a minute. Please, no.

No offense, but... you really don't. I really do. I haven't figured out what to change it to yet. Ethan, I've been there.

I'm Jerry Trask, head of the school board. I'm also obligated to inform you that present as well is a member of the Teacher's Union, Heather Simms. Well said, Heather, thank you. Do you know why you're here today? Come on, let's get to the firing. Whoa. No one said anything about firing. No one said anything about firing. Not, of course, before we hear Mr. Collins' explanation of what happened. Uh, well, I mean, I just thought that the play would be a great opportunity for the children-- Sorry, the play? Why are talking about the play? What do you mean? Because it was an atrocity. It wasn't the best-acted play of all time, but the kids are what, 10 years old? Are we not here to discuss the deplorable content of that play and to take action against this man? No, we are not. There was cursing and inappropriate content. Yeah, but it's art or whatever. I demand a vote on this. I thought the play was fantastic. Really great work. Yes, it resonated with me as well, reminded me of my first divorce. Great. Uh, so the vote is taken. Everybody enjoyed the play. But I faxed you a copy of it, then you called me the next day to request this meeting. What? That wasn't about the play. That was a coincidence. No, we'd like to talk to you today about something else, something very serious. Oh, my God. I know what this is about. I won Teacher of the Year, didn't I? My students nominated me, and I won. That's not even close. Why would--? No. Oh. Mr. Collins, you're here because your entire class failed their SAKS tests. Oh. Awesome. Thank God. Ha! What? Let's fire this MF-er. Okay-- Well, Hannah, as you may remember, Mr. Collins has tenure. So that's not exactly a possibility at the moment. But we do want to hear an explanation. HEATHER: Mr. Collins, wouldn't it be fair to say these children are of below-average intelligence? That could easily explain this all away. Uh, no. No, they're really bright kids. HEATHER: Then perhaps there were extenuating circumstances which would allow the students to retake the test. Perhaps the environment in which they took the test was compromised. Perhaps a distracting moth flew into the room, making it impossible to focus on the test. Because of the moth. Super loud moth? Mr. Collins, all that we're looking to hear from you is you did everything within your power to prepare your students for that test. Did you? I, uh... I did. I'm convinced. That settles it. Thank you very much for your time. This is ridiculous. That man is unfit to teach. So when should I have the students retake the test? Not till next year, once they repeat fifth grade. They have to repeat the grade? Well, the entire class failed, so... definitely. [♪♪♪] Uh, no. Uh, no. No, you can't do that to them, um... There was an extenuating circumstance. Don't say extenuating circum-- [ALL SIGH] The, uh... The extenuating circumstance was me. The children failed because of me. I'm, uh-- I'm an awful teacher. So are you saying-- Which I don't think you are. --that you did not do everything in your power to prepare them? That's what I'm saying. You understand that even with tenure, that's... That's a fireable offense. Yes, I understand that. So they'll get to retake the test, right? [SIGHS] They will. And... you're fired. Thank you. Well, I must say, I mean, this is-- This is incredibly fortunate. I mean, he was an awful influence on the children, and- Hey, guys, I am so sorry to interrupt, um... Yeah, let's, uh... Uh, assistant Principal Gruber, um, Trevor just had something he wanted to say to you. It's okay, buddy. Go ahead. Assistant Principal Gruber, I know that you wanted me to illegally spy on Mr. Collins while he was teaching, but I just can't do it. Even for all that confiscated candy you offered me as a brib. ETHAN: Yeah, a bribe. Uh, an inappropriate bribe to a child. And what about your sworn affidavit, buddy? This outlines what we discussed at our secret meetings. ETHAN: Secret meetings with a child. Um, between an adult and a child in secret. Uh, signature's at the bottom, it's legally binding. Yeah, signature's at the bottom. Signed it. Great. Uh, I think that's it. Uh, I want to thank you all again just for coming out tonight. It meant a lot to me, uh, and to the cast, uh, and we also just found out that we sold out the weekend, including the matinee, so... that's great. Uh, cool. You wanna say goodbye? Bye, Assistant Principal Gruber. Goodbye forever. Wait, what do you mean, "forever"? Well, her reign of terror is over. [♪♪♪] ["ALL BECAUSE OF YOU" PLAYING] ♪ I can laugh ♪ ♪ I can smile ♪ ♪ Hold my head way up high ♪ ♪ Baby, it's all... ♪ Hey. How did it go? They fired you, didn't they? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I'll tell you about it later. [KIDS CHUCKLE] Hey, Willy. Hey, kids. Um, you know what? Let's go find a karaoke bar that doesn't card. ALL [IN UNISON]: Yeah! ETHAN: Dear Paige. Dear Zach. Dear Holly. Dear Matt. Dear Andrew. Dear Buddy? Dear Trevor. As you've all probably heard by now, I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. While this makes me very sad because I won't get to see you or hang out with you every da, it also makes me extremely happy because I'm free now from the shackles of that place. I haven't been a very good teacher and my hope for you is that you're able to forget and move on from our time together. I do have one last lesson for you though. I think that in life the best you can hope for is to figure out what you're passionate about and pursue it full-force. Then, when you start to come to terms with the fact that life will crush your hopes and dreams and that you will fail, then you go and try to make a difference in a child's life. Become a teacher. At least temporarily. Until, you know, you figure out your next move. If you wanna write me back-- Which I would love. --just give your letters to Miss Abigail. I'm shacking up with her for an unspecified period of time right now. Because Mr. Collins doesn't have a steady source of income or a place to live. Also-- And please don't tell the other students this. --but you were always my favorite. Sincerely, Mr. Collins. Hey, guys, did he say you were his favorite too? [CHUCKLES] That asshole.
