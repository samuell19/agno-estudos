I'M A HOSTESS AT A RESTAURANT. AND MR. TATE IS A SUCCESSFUL ARCHITECT WITH A SIZABLE INCOME. HE CURRENTLY RESIDES AT HIS FAMILY HOME WITH THE CHILDREN. IN LIGHT OF THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS COURT TODAY, I'M AWARDING FULL CUSTODY, ON A TEMPORARY BASIS, TO THE CHILDREN'S FATHER. Rachel: NO, YOUR HONOR, PLEASE, IF YOU WOULD JUST HEAR OUR TESTIMONY AS TO THE KIND OF MAN THAT DANIEL TATE IS! MR. TATE'S CHARACTER IS NOT ON TRIAL HERE, YOUR HONOR. NO. NO, PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY CHILDREN AWAY. MRS. TATE WILL BE GIVEN WEEKEND VISITATION PRIVILEGES. Maryanne: HOW CAN HE DO THIS?! YOU'RE LYING, DANIEL. I NEVER ABANDONED YOU! [ GAVEL BANGS ] I'M BEGGING YOU, YOUR HONOR! BAILIFF. PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY CHILDREN AWAY FROM ME! MARYANNE, CALM DOWN, PLEASE! PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY CHILDREN! PLEASE! CALM DOWN! PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY CHILDREN AWAY! [ Sobbing ] PLEASE! PLEASE DON'T! PLEASE DON'T. PLEASE DON'T. OH, ROSIE. I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD. ROSIE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL THEM WHEN THEY ASK YOU WHY YOU LEFT? WHY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM? I'M GONNA TELL THEM THE TRUTH. I LOVE THEM TOO MUCH TO LIE TO THEM, AND EVERY TIME I COVER FOR DANIEL, I'M... I'M LYING. OH. THERE THEY ARE! OH, LOUISE, THERE THEY ARE! HI, KIDS. OH. OH! OH! MM! OH! OH, YOU FEEL SO GOOD. HAVE THEM BACK BY 5:00, MARYANNE. THIS ARRANGEMENT IS JUST UNTIL I'M MORE SETTLED IN. BY 5:00. NO LATER. IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS. OH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, HUH? WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD PICK UP A PIZZA AND BRING IT BACK TO MY PLACE, AND THEN YOU GUYS CAN HELP ME PAINT MY APARTMENT. HMM? ALL YOUR FAVORITE COLORS. WE'LL FIX IT UP TOGETHER. HOW DOES THAT SOUND? OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS. WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH? COME ON. IT'S OKAY. NOW, I THOUGHT WE SHOULD WALK JUST LIKE WE USED TO. IT'LL BE MORE FUN, OKAY? COME HERE. JASON? YOU DIDN'T FINISH TELLING ME ABOUT SCHOOL. HOW'S SOCCER? OKAY. OH, OH, JOSIE, HONEY, BE CAREFUL. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TURPENTINE LEFT. DADDY WON'T LET ME TAKE BALLET ANYMORE. WHAT, HONEY? DADDY WON'T LET ME TAKE BALLET ANYMORE. WHY NOT? HE SAYS IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME TO BE AROUND ALL THOSE OTHER KIDS. I DON'T CARE WHAT DADDY SAYS. [ Voice breaking ] I DON'T LIKE IT THERE WITHOUT YOU. JOSIE! JOSIE, GET OVER HERE! YOU'RE SO STUPID! JASON! JASON! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] JASON! JASON! JASON, YOU COME BACK HERE! NO! [ SOBS ] [ SOBBING ] HEY. YOU KNOW, UH, HOCKEY SEASON'S ABOUT READY TO START UP AGAIN. I GOT 'EM -- SEASON TICKETS. YEAH? YEAH. GREAT. I FIGURE WE CAN MAKE ABOUT TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE GAMES. YOU NEVER ASKED ABOUT MOM TODAY. WE NEVER TALK ABOUT HER. NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. SHE'S GONE. SHE'S OUT OF OUR LIVES. DON'T YOU CARE? OF COURSE I CARE. IT'S BETTER THIS WAY, BELIEVE ME. YOU STILL LOVE HER? COME HERE. I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. [ SIGHS ] YOUR MOTHER... DOESN'T WANT YOU ANYMORE. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. IT'S THE TRUTH. I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU, WOULD I? WE TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING, RIGHT? I GUESS. THAT'S WHY I KICKED HER OUT. THAT'S WHY SHE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. BECAUSE OF US? LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT YOU WERE BOUND TO FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER. YOUR MOTHER WAS PLANNING ON LEAVING US. NO. SHE NEVER WANTED TO COME BACK HERE AFTER SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL. SHE WAS GOING TO ABANDON YOU AND YOUR SISTER. NO. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY I DID IT. THAT'S WHY I ASKED HER TO LEAVE -- TO PROTECT YOU. I WISH I COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU. I WISH... [ SIGHS ] ...I COULD MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY. YOUR SON'S OUTBURSTS ARE GETTING OUT OF HAND, MRS. TATE. TODAY HE BEAT UP A BOY HALF HIS SIZE FOR NO APPARENT REASON. WAS THE BOY BADLY HURT? A FEW BRUISES, CONSIDERING THE BEATING HE TOOK. WE HAD TO SEND HIM HOME. AND JASON -- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM? WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM A 24-HOUR SUSPENSION TO COOL HIM OFF. BUT THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME IT'S HAPPENED, MRS. TATE. WE TRIED TO CONTACT HIS FATHER REPEATEDLY, BUT HE HASN'T RESPONDED. WE TRIED TO GET AHOLD OF HIM TODAY, BUT HE STILL HASN'T RESPONDED. I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS WAS GOING ON. MR. GRAYSON... MY CHILDREN DON'T LIVE WITH ME. WE'RE AWARE OF THE SITUATION, MRS. TATE, BUT THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE JASON'S BEHAVIOR. JASON HAS A LOT OF ANGER IN HIM, DANGEROUS ANGER. YOU SEE, THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY HARD ON HIM. AND I THINK NOW, WITH ME BEING GONE, IT'S -- CLEARLY THE BOY NEEDS HELP. I'M GOING TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION THAT JASON RECEIVES COUNSELING, BUT YOU BETTER DO IT NOW, MRS. TATE. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, JASON'S RAGE WILL COST HIM MORE THAN JUST A FEW DAYS AWAY FROM SCHOOL. ARE YOU HUNGRY? I ASKED YOU A QUESTION. JASON... WE HAVE TO TALK. NO! I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, AND WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. YOU CAN'T KEEP SHUTTING ME OUT. I'LL DO WHAT I WANT! NOT IN THIS HOUSE. THIS IS YOUR HOUSE! I DON'T LIVE HERE! YOU DON'T WANT ME! OF COURSE I WANT YOU -- MORE THAN ANYTHING. WHERE WOULD YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT? DAD SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT US, THAT YOU WERE JUST GONNA LEAVE! THAT ISN'T TRUE! THAT YOU'RE SICK OF US! THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE OUR MOTHER ANYMORE! YOU ARE MY LIFE. NO! I LOVE YOU. NO! NO! NO! HONEY, NO. NO, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. NO!! STOP IT. NO! NO! NO! NO! STOP! LOOK AT YOURSELF! IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? YOU WANT A LIFE LIKE YOUR FATHER HAD WITH ME? IS THIS HOW YOU LOVE? [ Sobbing ] IS THIS HOW YOU LOVE? [ SNIFFLES ] WHY DID YOU LET HIM DO THAT TO YOU? WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM? WHY DID YOU LET HIM HIT YOU? BECAUSE I THOUGHT I DESERVED IT. NO. I THOUGHT I WAS NO GOOD. ALL THAT TIME HE HIT YOU... AND I COULDN'T STOP HIM. IT WASN'T YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. I WANTED TO, BUT I COULDN'T. I KNOW. OH, HONEY, I KNOW. OH, HONEY, WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO YOU? WHAT HAVE WE DONE? IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO. GO AHEAD AND CRY. I'M HERE. I'M HERE. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE EVER AGAIN. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY! OH, HI, HONEY. HOW'S MY GIRL, HUH? HOW'S MY GIRL? DANIEL, I'VE BEEN WAITING OVER AN HOUR. WELL, I HAD THINGS TO DO. I LEFT WORK EARLY BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO MEET RIGHT AWAY. OKAY, OKAY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CALLED THIS MEETING. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK. I HAVE NOTHING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, MARYANNE. YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME. DANIEL, PLEASE. SHUT UP, MARYANNE! JASON, HERE ARE MY KEYS. YOU TWO GO WAIT IN THE CAR. I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER ALONE. GO ON. WELL? JASON NEEDS HELP. WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM INTO SOME KIND OF THERAPY. [ SCOFFS ] HE DOESN'T NEED THERAPY. HE'S IN TROUBLE, DANIEL. NOW, THE SCHOOL SAYS THEY'VE TRIED TO CALL YOU. WELL, I'M A BUSY MAN. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY, THEN GIVE THEM BACK TO ME. OH, YEAH. RIGHT. STOP LYING TO THEM. [ CHUCKLES ] BOY, YOU'RE REALLY SOMETHING, MARYANNE, YOU KNOW. YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. AND YET YOU'RE GONNA GET THE KIDS BACK. YEAH, RIGHT. DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME, DANIEL! YOU'RE PATHETIC. THIS IS ABOUT THE CHILDREN! YOU GUYS GET YOUR JACKETS OFF, AND I'LL GET DINNER READY. JASON, TAKE YOUR JACKET OFF. YOU'LL CATCH COLD. JOSIE, STOP IT. STOP IT, SWEETHEART. STOP IT, YOU TWO. COME ON. COME ON. YOU GUYS WANT SOME HOT CHOCOLATE? YES, PLEASE. TAKE YOUR CAP OFF, JASON. JASON. TAKE OFF YOUR CAP! MY GOD. HAVE YOU BEEN FIGHTING AT SCHOOL AGAIN? IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AT SCHOOL. DADDY DID IT. WHAT? DADDY AND JASON HAD A FIGHT. SHUT UP! IS THIS TRUE? DID YOUR FATHER HIT YOU? WE WERE PLAYING CATCH, AND I GOT IN THE WAY OF THE BALL. DON'T COVER FOR HIM, DAMN IT! DID HE HIT YOU? IF HE HIT YOU, JASON, I HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE? HE HIT ME, OKAY?! WE GOT INTO IT ABOUT YOU, AND HE PUNCHED ME! OH, JASON. YOU SHOULDN'T TALK TO HIM ABOUT ME. WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN YOUR DADDY AND ME IS OUR BUSINESS. I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. WHAT HAPPENED? HE BACKED ME INTO A CORNER. [ SIGHS ] HE STARTED POUNDING ON ME. I COULDN'T MOVE. I COULDN'T EVEN GET AWAY. THIS WILL NEVER, EVER HAPPEN AGAIN -- NOT TO YOU, NOT TO ME. NEVER AGAIN, I PROMISE YOU. NEVER AGAIN. [ TIRES SCREECH ] [ ENGINE TURNS OFF ] [ DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ] WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE HERE. YOU'RE TRESPASSING. IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF HERE NOW -- DON'T THREATEN ME, DANIEL. IT WON'T WORK ANYMORE. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT YOUR THREATS. I'M HERE ABOUT JASON. ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT JASON? WHY DID YOU HIT HIM? IT WAS JUST A LITTLE SLAP. HE HAS A BLACK EYE! HE OPENED A MOUTH TO ME. DON'T YOU EVER, EVER LAY A HAND ON MY SON AGAIN! YOUR SON? MY SON. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE COURT GAVE ME CUSTODY FOR BOTH OF -- 'CAUSE YOU LIED! AND THE COURT WON'T ALLOW ME TO DEFEND MYSELF AGAINST YOU. YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER REASON, MARYANNE. ALL THOSE YEARS I BELIEVED I WAS NOTHING. YOU ARE NOTHING. NO, NOT ANYMORE. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN, DANIEL. WHO ARE THEY? [ SCOFFS ] YOU CAN'T, CAN YOU? BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THEM. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM. YOU'RE JUST USING THEM TO GET BACK AT ME BECAUSE... I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE. DON'T YOU HIT ME AGAIN! DON'T YOU EVER HIT ME! DON'T -- I WON'T LET YOU HURT ME ANYMORE! NO! NO! NO! [ BARKING CONTINUES ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] WHO IS IT? IT'S ME -- MARYANNE. [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] HEY. OH, YOUR FACE. WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? TO SEE DANIEL. WHERE ARE THE KIDS? AT MY PLACE. LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO SEE ME LIKE THIS, SO I TOOK A CHANCE AND CAME HERE. YOU SAW DANIEL ALONE? ARE YOU CRAZY? I HAD TO. HE HIT JASON. WHEN? LAST NIGHT. DID YOU TAKE HIM TO A DOCTOR? NO, NO, NO, I WENT STRAIGHT TO SEE DANIEL. OH, NO, YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM TO A DOCTOR AND PHOTOGRAPH ANY BRUISES. EVERY BIT OF DOCUMENTATION IS A PIECE OF EVIDENCE FOR THE JUDGE. NOW, THE NEXT TIME SOMETHING -- THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A NEXT TIME, LOUISE. I'M NEVER GOING TO TAKE THEM BACK THERE AGAIN. I'M KEEPING THEM WITH ME. YOU CAN'T. DANIEL HAS CUSTODY, MARYANNE. BY LAW, HE HAS RIGHTS. WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHTS? DON'T I HAVE RIGHTS?! WHERE ARE THE LAWS THAT PROTECT ME AND MY CHILDREN? DON'T I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP THEM SAFE? YOU KNOW WHAT THE JUDGE SAID. WELL, DAMN THE JUDGE! [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] THESE ARE MY CHILDREN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, DANIEL ALMOST KILLED ME. HE COULD KILL THEM. I WON'T TAKE THAT CHANCE. I WANT YOU TO CALL RACHEL AND ASK FOR AN EMERGENCY HEARING. OH, NO, NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. JUST CALL HER. [ SIGHS ] [ CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ] SHE'S HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME. THANKS FOR GETTING HER IN HERE, LOUISE. I KNOW THIS CLASS WAS FULL, BUT SHE LOVES IT SO. LOOK AT HER. OH, SHE'S SO SWEET. I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT TO DIE, LOUISE. I DON'T WANT DANIEL TO TAKE THAT FROM HER. DID YOU TALK TO RACHEL? OH, YEAH, I GOT A PACKET RIGHT HERE. THERE'S LOTS FOR US TO DO. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY THAT YOU KEEP THESE KIDS, THAT'S ANOTHER DAY AGAINST YOU. I JUST WANT THAT JUDGE TO LOOK AT JASON'S FACE, IN HIS EYES, AND THEN TELL HIM HE HAS TO GO BACK TO HIS FATHER. [ DOOR OPENS ] LIGHTS OUT, HONEY. IT'S VERY LATE. SWEET DREAMS. MOM? HMM? ARE WE EVER GONNA SEE DAD AGAIN? I DON'T KNOW. DOES HE LOVE US? OH, JASON. I THINK -- I THINK HE LOVES US VERY MUCH. BUT WHY DOES HE HURT US? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK HE EVEN KNOWS. I...THINK HE'S SCARED. I WISH IT COULD BE NORMAL, THAT WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER, THAT HE WOULDN'T HURT US. WELL, YOU'RE SAFE NOW. AND NO ONE CAN HURT YOU, AND NOTHING CAN HARM YOU. SO JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES. CLOSE YOUR EYES. AND I'LL STAY WITH YOU TILL YOU GO TO SLEEP, OKAY? OKAY. I love you. [ SIGHS ] YOUR HONOR, MRS. TATE HAS DELIBERATELY KEPT HER CHILDREN FROM THEIR FATHER. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES. Judge Greenstein: IS THAT TRUE, MRS. TATE? I'VE ONLY REGISTERED, CARE OF MY ATTORNEY AND ADVOCATE. MRS. TATE, THE COURT MUST HAVE A RESIDENCE ADDRESS FOR YOU ON RECORD. I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR, I CAN'T. I WON'T. THAT IS ILLEGAL. MY CLIENT HAS RIGHTS. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT DANIEL'S RIGHTS! THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ABUSER, NOT THE CHILDREN. MRS. TATE -- MY SON RETURNED HOME TO ME WITH A BLACK EYE AND A SWOLLEN CHEEK, INJURIES HIS FATHER GAVE HIM. I BELIEVE MRS. TATE IS EXAGGERATING, YOUR HONOR. ACCORDING TO MY CLIENT'S TESTIMONY, IT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE. HE SLAPPED THE BOY FOR BEING FRESH. THE BOY HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. HE WAS SIMPLY EXERCISING HIS RIGHT TO DISCIPLINE THE YOUNG MAN. DISCIPLINE? HE BEAT HIM! YOUR HONOR, MY CHILDREN ARE AFRAID OF THEIR FATHER. THEY DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH HIM. IN FACT, RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE HIM. CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH PARENTS. WHAT IF IT ISN'T HEALTHY FOR THEM? WHAT IF ONE OF THE PARENTS IS EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE? THAT IS NOT FOR MRS. TATE TO DECIDE. YOUR HONOR, PLEASE. IF YOU WILL JUST HEAR MY TESTIMONY OF DANIEL'S ABUSE. MRS. TATE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I MIGHT WANT TO, AT THIS POINT, I CANNOT ADMIT SPOUSAL ABUSE. HE BEAT ME FOR YEARS. IT IS IRRELEVANT IN CUSTODY CASES. NOW HE'S ABUSING MY CHILDREN. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT HERE. THAT ISN'T TRUE, AND YOU KNOW IT! IT'S THE LAW. THE HELL WITH THE LAW, YOUR HONOR! [ SIGHS ] MRS. TATE... I'M GIVING YOU 24 HOURS TO REPORT YOUR RESIDENCE ADDRESS TO THIS COURT... AND TO RETURN THE CHILDREN TO THEIR HOME. THEY ARE HOME... ...WITH ME. MRS. TATE, I'M PLACING YOU IN CONTEMPT. PLEASE, IF YOU'LL ONLY HEAR ME. 24 HOURS, OR I'LL HAVE A WARRANT OUT FOR YOUR ARREST. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] SO, ARE THEY SLEEPING? I CAN'T TAKE THEM BACK TO HIM, LOUISE. I WON'T DO IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T? I'LL LEAVE THE STATE IF I HAVE TO. I'LL GO SO FAR AWAY HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND US. HE CAN BRING KIDNAPPING CHARGES AGAINST YOU. I DON'T CARE. THESE ARE MY CHILDREN. AND THE LAW IS THE LAW. Yeah. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY, ISN'T THERE, LOUISE? I COULD DISAPPEAR. MARYANNE -- ROSALIE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT AT THE SHELTER. SHE HAS A FRIEND WHO'S LIVING UNDERGROUND. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING TO BRING UP LIGHTLY. I CAN'T ADVOCATE IT. ONLY WOMEN IN EXTREME CASES -- THIS IS EXTREME, LOUISE! IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING, IF I DON'T TAKE IT INTO MY OWN HANDS, I could lose my children. GOING UNDERGROUND IS SERIOUS BUSINESS, MARYANNE. NOW, OFFICIALLY, I CAN'T HELP YOU. I'D BE PUTTING THE CENTER IN JEOPARDY. BUT AS MY FRIEND? LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE INTO HERE, HON. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES -- SERIOUS ONES. I CAN HANDLE IT. REALLY? ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS. BUT CAN YOU HANDLE THE EMOTIONAL STRESS OF MOVING YOUR KIDS, CHANGING THEIR NAMES? THERE'D BE NO RECORDS. BEFORE THIS IS ALL DONE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. WE'LL JUST DEAL WITH IT. BUT COULD YOU DEAL WITH GOING TO JAIL? 'CAUSE THAT COULD HAPPEN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR KIDS THEN? WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU LOST THEM? IT'S A CHANCE I HAVE TO TAKE. IT'S MY ONLY HOPE, LOUISE. [ SIGHS ] Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. MARYANNE... YOU WILL HAVE NO PAST. SO WE'RE ON THE RUN. DANIEL'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. I CAN FEEL IT. LOOK AT ALL THIS HAIR! I KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW'S THAT LOOK? IT LOOKS GREAT! YOU LIKE IT? YOU LIKE IT? WILL WE HAVE TO LEAVE TOWN? NO. DADDY DOESN'T KNOW WHERE WE LIVE, SO WE CAN STAY HERE. WHAT ABOUT CAITLIN? NOT. NAH. NAH. WE'LL PICK A PERFECT NAME FOR YOU. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] YAY! YAY! YAY! [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] LOUISE LEVY. WHO? OH! YES, I-I'LL HOLD. YES? JUST A MINUTE. LET ME CHECK. TOMORROW IS JUST FINE. THANKS. LEAH, GET ME ALL OF THE RECORDS FOR THE CUSTODY CASES OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND CALL ELLA AND GET HERS, TOO, OKAY? THANKS. CONGRESSWOMAN MORELLA AND I HAVE GONE THROUGH THESE FILES. THESE STORIES ARE FRIGHTENING. SOMETIMES WE GET AS MANY AS 50 CALLS A DAY FROM ABUSED WOMEN WANTING TO LEAVE THE HOME. BUT THEY DON'T. MOST OF THEM HAVE NOTHING ON THEIR OWN. THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'LL LOSE THEIR CHILDREN. WELL, THAT'S WHY THE CONGRESSWOMAN CALLED FOR THIS DATA. THERE'S GOING TO BE A PRESS CONFERENCE TO GAIN SUPPORT. AND WE NEED WOMEN WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK. DO YOU HAVE ANYONE? ANYONE AT ALL? COULD YOU JUST GET BACK, PLEASE? Man: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS, MRS. SARA WILLIAMS. MY NAME IS NOT SARA WILLIAMS. AND I AM A FUGITIVE. AND IF THE JUDGE SEES THIS HEARING, I WILL BE PLACED UNDER ARREST. I MIGHT EVEN BE CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING. AND I'M NOT ALONE. IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, EIGHT WOMEN A MINUTE ARE BEING PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY THEIR MATES. MOST OF THEM HAVE NO MONEY OR NO PLACE TO GO, SO, FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILDREN, THEY STAY IN A VIOLENT SITUATION. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE SPENT THE LAST 11 YEARS OF MY LIFE AS A BATTERED WOMAN. AND I'M STILL BEING BATTERED, ONLY THIS TIME BY THE COURTS AND BY A GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT HONOR OR RESPECT WOMEN, BUT INSTEAD STRIPS US OF OUR RIGHTS AND OUR DIGNITY. I LOST CUSTODY OF MY CHILDREN TO THE MAN WHO BEAT ME FOR 11 YEARS. I LOST CUSTODY BECAUSE THE JUDGE REFUSED TO HEAR MY TESTIMONY OF SPOUSAL ABUSE. I WAS THREATENED WITH ABANDONMENT AND DESERTION AND THEN NOT ALLOWED TO DEFEND MYSELF OR MY CHILDREN. THIS IS BECAUSE JUDGES MAY NOT AND SHALL NOT HEAR EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL SPOUSAL ABUSE IN CUSTODY CASES. IT IS IRRELEVANT. "IRRELEVANT." [ SCOFFS ] I'VE HEARD THAT WORD A LOT SINCE ALL THIS STARTED. OUR COURTS ARE INSENSITIVE TO OUR PAIN. FOR YEARS, I HID, ASHAMED OF MY BRUISES, AFRAID OF MY SHAME. AND NOW THAT I'M FREE, I'M STILL HIDING. ALL I WANT IS TO BE HEARD. ALL I WANT IS TO GIVE MY CHILDREN A HOME, TO LOVE THEM AND TAKE CARE OF THEM WITHOUT THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE. SO, PLEASE... PLEASE, I BEG YOU... GIVE ME BACK MY CHILDREN. Judge Greenstein: SOME TIME AGO, I PLACED MRS. MARYANNE WALKER TATE IN CONTEMPT OF THIS COURT. SINCE THAT TIME, THE STATE OF MARYLAND HAS BECOME ONE OF MANY STATES TO ADOPT THE MORELLA RESOLUTION, ALLOWING DOMESTIC-COURT JUDGES THE RIGHT TO HEAR TESTIMONY OF SPOUSAL ABUSE IN CUSTODY CASES. IT IS WITH THAT RIGHT THAT I ASK HER ATTORNEY TO CALL MRS. MARYANNE WALKER TATE TO THE STAND. I WILL HEAR HER TESTIMONY OF ABUSE. Rachel: YOUR HONOR, I CALL MRS. MARYANNE WALKER TATE TO THE STAND. Bailiff: RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND AND REPEAT AFTER ME. I... I... ...MARYANNE WALKER TATE... ...MARYANNE WALKER TATE... ...DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR... ...DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR... ...TO TELL THE TRUTH... ...TO TELL THE TRUTH... ...THE WHOLE TRUTH... ...THE WHOLE TRUTH... ...AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH... ...AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH... SO HELP ME GOD. SO HELP ME GOD.
