We went for an ultrasound. -How far gone is she? -She'll have it anytime. You should be at home. I heard the heartbeat... She's happy! How are you? All okay? You got everything? Mum bought me coloured pens and school books... I'm getting another lawyer. It's gonna be okay. I'll be out soon, you'll see. It won't stick. You'll soon be a grown man! Promise you'll look after Mum? -Until I come home... -Yes! Do what Mum tells you? I'm counting on you, you know. Love you. Children, listen to me! We're going to practice sentences. Say what I say, okay? My mother is a doctor. My mother is a doctor. My father is a policeman. My father is a policeman. Super! Now take your books out and write a sentence using the words on the board, okay? No, I want pálinka! The neighbour sells it! Buy us some pálinka! -Mariann! -The next neighbour! I got 4 years, I didn't have any more, and still had 2 years inside 21 months... -We should've cooked the skin separately! -Who wants what? Hang on, Tibi was here first, so take his! -3 kilos of flank! -3 kilos of flank. On credit? -On credit. -Write it up, Józsika. 3 kilos of flank, Tibi Kocsis. Weigh it, Zorán! Put it in a bag. -Don't you need your scales? -No... It was on the TV... It's like I said. It happened not far from the village. -They killed the whole family! -Oh, God! They didn't spare the kiddie! -They shot him! He wasn't even five. -Jesus, poor thing! -What are you looking for? -Dad's helmet. Ricsi! -You should be in bed, sweetie! -I promised Dad I'll look after you, Mum! You little darling! Your father meant... Okay. You can stay up for another half hour. You brushed your teeth? I'm here! -Goal! -What a move! Great! Petya! Nice! To me! Do you know who that was? It was the gun man. -And who's the "gun man"? -The forester. Jani. Lives by the woods. He shoots dogs. He cooks them and eats them with his family. Dad says that if you eat dog meat, your skin goes white. That's why the gun man's got white skin. -You're so dirty! Your clothes ripped... -Scruff! Come here! The gun man won't get you, he won't shoot you! I'll protect you! I'll save you! -What "gun man"? -Jani the forester. He comes into the village, shoots the dogs and eats them with his family. Jani the forester? You're talking rubbish. Why would he eat dogs? He's got enough to eat... Wash your ears, okay? -What did he get? -Two years! Oh, no... Don't go wandering off! What will I tell your dad if the white-faced dragon takes you? Didn't you know that a dragon lives in the woods? -He breathes this mist out. -Why? So he can hide and spy on us from behind it. The dragon's heart is cold and white. That's why he's hungry for the happiness that lives in our red hearts. Can you hear his hungry cries? If you don't wander off, you'll be safe. We're afraid of him, but... he's scared of us, too. -What gun is it? -It's a 36.7-mm... -Quite a gun! -...repeating rifle, semi-automatic. You pull this back... and load it here. Slide this over... Scruff! Scruff! It's me! Why doesn't Scruff know me, Mum? Is he sick? -He's sick! A fox bit him! -What's the gun man doing here? Don't cry! Dad gave me Scruff! Scruff was a good dog! He was mine.. You let the gun man shoot him and take him home and eat him! I hate you! Wake up! -Give me one! On the right! -And another! There! -Stay here! -Don't! -Come on! -Fuck the lot of you! You're gonna burn in hell, filthy Gypsies! -No! -Liza! You're gonna burn! -You're dead! -You're gonna burn, rat Gypsy bitch! -Burn, burn! -Behind the house! Go! Run as fast as you can! Understand? You understand? -Come on, let's go! -Mum! Go! I love you! Never forget that! -I love you! -Two more rats inside! Go! Run! -Come on! -Don't let him run, shoot! The boy is in shock. We need to keep him in for observation. I know what that means. You want to put my grand-kid in care! His place is with his family! -When can I bury my daughter? -The medical expert says they still... My dad went stealing melons on his back but he forgot to take a sack. How many sacks did he bring back? Nine. One-two-three-four-five- six-seven-eight-nine... My dad went stealing melons on his back but he forgot... Let him be! That's right! Rest and walk! Don't stop, just walk! Good! Don't hurry, just walk. Nice and calm... Nice and slow, breathe as you go, in through your nose, out your mouth! Start running when you hear the whistle! It's not a race, just run. No need to overtake. Ready? No need to overtake, we're in no hurry! If you get cramp, hold your arms up, take a deep breath, and let them down slowly. That's right! Good! Very good! Look where you're going! Come with me! Sit down! Szõke come here! Watch the class! You can all play. Come on! We're gonna play a game! Make a circle! We're playing "throw out"! Ales, fetch a ball! Next to each other, not in two lines! Throw it! Don't be lazy, throw it! Grab the ball and throw it! Throw it at baldie! Hit baldie! Throw it, Gypsy boy! Make him cry! Throw it at the bald Gypsy! Throw it at baldie! Throw it at the bald Gypsy! Don't let the ball out! Go and get it! What's going on here? -Stop! -What's wrong with you? Filthy Gypsy! They should have killed you, too! Teacher! Cut that out! That's enough! That's enough! Let him go! And you! Calm down already! You'd better stay home for a couple of days. I'd like your relatives to come and see me tomorrow. You can go home. At least come in for a coffee! I would, but you know... the wife... I just remembered! -She sent this meat for you. -Thanks! Take this in, son! -How's the kid? -Never speaks, hardly eats a thing. -You not coming in? -Next time! -Need anything, just shout! -Thanks! Eat! Eat up, son, you're so pale! Eat! Why aren't you eating? I'm not going to eat dog meat! Dad! Is it really dog meat? -It's not dog meat! Eat! -I'm not eating either! It's not dog meat! You can't leave the table until you eat your meat, son! Enough! Stop that! Go to your room! Dad! Dad! -Dad! -What? -Come in, breakfast's ready! -Just a minute, I need to do something. -Okay! -But you go in! CHAPTER TWO VIRÁG One, prepare! Two, prepare! Three, prepare! Four, prepare! Five, prepare! Six, prepare! Seven, prepare! Take aim! Breathe in! Tense! Hold it in! Hold in! Hold in! And, shoot! Take aim! Tense, breathe in! Hold it, hold it... And, shoot! Who was that? My old controller from the secret service. -What was he doing here? -If I told you, I'd have to kill you. Very funny! -More of the dogs are getting sick. -Public Health are coming tomorrow. Don't worry, they'll bring medicine. -Who's that on the mountain? -That's my old man! He spent years in Kosovo. He was a peacekeeper. It was all he talked about. He always wanted to go back. But then cancer took him. I went there a couple of years ago. We could start new life there. Just you and me. And the mountains. You know I've got to go... You give me a lift? Were you at the kennels again? Do you have to go so much? More dogs are getting sick, Mum. - You'll catch an infection. - Oh, Mum! I've put money on the kitchen table, it's for your school lunch tomorrow. I'm going to bed! I love you! The Israelites multiplied greatly and increased in numbers. And the King of Egypt spoke: "The Israelites have become far too numerous for us. if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him, but if it is a girl, let her live." I won't tell you again, carry on, please! "A Levite woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She hid him for three months. When she could hide him no longer, she took a papyrus cradle. She placed the child in it and put it in the Nile..." Next! "Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe. She saw the basket among the reeds." Good! Next! "She opened it and saw the crying baby. She declared she would raise him as her own. She named him Moses, saying, I drew him out of the water." Let's sum up what we've heard! Pharaoh issued a decree for all baby boys to be killed. Then we have a mother who gives birth to a baby boy, puts him in a basket and entrusts him to the Nile. Then the third party is Pharaoh's daughter, -who goes down... Yes? -I vote for abortion and screw 'em! Let's take a more refined approach to the topic! Let's think about the significance of the mother's role. And not only her role... Put you stuff down! Then take your places by lanes four, five, six, seven and eight! Leave your flip-flops here. Get in and wait for the whistle! Go! And back! Good day! Bone broth, stuffed cabbage, bread with sour cream... Hi, Mum! Hi! I'll bring it in a minute, sit outside! Take a serving spoon... What's wrong, you not eating more? What are your plans today? Go home, have a shower and then... go to the kennels. Take a coat, it's sure to rain. You think I'm doing this 'cus I want to?! You think I like this? Stop! You hear me? Stop! I am not a murderer! What's he doing here? -Leave the door alone! -Mum, what's he doing here? Let go of the door, what are you doing? You gone mad? What's wrong with you? -Stop it! You lost your mind? -I won't stop it! Your dad can't come up? Is that your problem again? He's not my dad! I'm not gonna watch this! I'm leaving! Stay, please stay! Leave me alone! -Not like this! I'm going! -Stay, please! You're the same shit as him! You deserve each other! Did you know I nearly got rid of you when I was pregnant? If your dad hadn't been there, you'd have never been born! It's thanks to him that you're alive. I know what he did to you... ...completely unforgivable. But he was there by my side... ...by your side. I'm so scared that I'll end up on my own! The years just roll on and no one needs me. Prepare! Aim, tense, breathe in! Keep it in! Keep it in! And shoot! We're done for today, you were great! Break your kit down! Pack up! All your gear... Virág, next time pay more attention to holding back, holding your breath Keep your wrists loose, and concentrate when you draw back... Ok? -What are you doing here? -I watched your training. Looked great! What's wrong? You mad with me? Don't do this! I've got a little surprise! You'll love it, believe me! Come on! Go in to her! They were born this morning. So sweet! So? You still mad with me? Listen, there's something I've got to tell you. -Why? What's wrong? -The thing is... -Look, you've got to go! -Why? Don't worry about that! Do what I said, okay? -Hello! -Hey, there! Come on! Do we always have to wait for you? Come on! Hold the bottle properly. Light it before you fucking throw it! You stupid? Throw it hard! Hold it here! You're an idiot! You're gonna fucking catch fire! Look! -Come on! Fuck yeah! -Watch this! Watch! I'm gonna burn it to fuck! Yeah! Yeah! Look at this! Brilliant! -Come out! -Throw it! -Come on, come on, come on! Let it burn! -Burn, burn! What's wrong? You not hungry? -Hey! -Don't, Mum! -You coming to watch TV? -I'm gonna go to bed. School tomorrow. GYPSIES LIVE IN TERROR! ANOTHER GYPSY FAMILY ATTACKED! THREE DEAD! 9-YEAR-OLD BOY SURVIVES! -What are you up to? -I thought the dogs would be hungry. Stop! I decide when the dogs are hungry! -What are you doing? -I've got to go to training. I'm sorry, I'm really tired. -Let me go! -What's wrong with you? Let go of me! You're 10 or 11 weeks pregnant. Does your mum know? What's your plan? Because if you want to get rid of it, you're still in time. The longer you wait, the riskier an abortion gets. Think! I'll give you a week. You can get dressed. What are you thinking? That we are buddies? What did you say to the cops? -I didn't say a thing! -What did you say to the cops? What did you say to the cops? Stop bullshitting! You shit! -I didn't say a thing! -Nothing? -Give the shit a drink! -What did you fucking say? Give him a drink! That's better! Leave the wanker, let him go! -Leave him! -Should we leave you? -Stop it, please! -Give him some! -So much for old schoolmate! -Look who's here! Run! Fucking bitch! My dog's gonna tear you to bits, you bitch! CHAPTER THREE HANNA ...then they shoved me, they kept hitting me, one head-butted me, the other one threw me against the fence. They pushed me down and shouted: "Filthy Gypsy, Hitler didn't do a thorough job!" Can anyone confirm this? Unfortunately not. -So there's no witness. -Go back to your seat! Your Honour, I'd like to present the following document! "My clients, in full knowledge of their duties, stated the following they made no insulting comments related to the defendant's racial origins during their handling of him." - Look at them, they're Nazis, skinheads! - Silence in court! Please avoid expressing your views in such a manner, otherwise I'll place you in contempt! - But... - To continue. The court does not, at present, cons the defendant's claims as substantial the court will now retire to consider its judgment. -Look, they're bringing him in! -Who? The one who grassed on the others. They gave him a good beating. That's why he's under 24-hour guard. Commandos, separate cell, everything -Let's go... -I've still got another hearing. -Chinese for lunch? -Maybe! Thanks! Next week then... Walk with me! Mihály Kovács, one of our defendants. He confessed following his arrest. He insisted that he only drove the car and had no blood on his hand. He served in the secret service for six years. He infiltrated extremist groups and reported back on them. He had a mental breakdown a few year and was retired from service. Of course, the press has sniffed out his secret service past. This is where you come in. You should agree to be his defense lawyer. Prepare for the hearing, the press will be here soon. You're capable, diligent and you have an exemplary record. You'd be an excellent applicant for my job. One more thing. Where possible, don't mention the defendant's agent past. There are plenty conspiracy theories flying around as it is. All done for today. -You want a lift home? -Yeah, I'll be out in a minute. I'd like to speak to my client. In private. You look at me like I'm a murderer. But I haven't murdered anyone. You have to believe I was only the driver. I wanted out but they said they'd kill me. -What's the charge? -Manslaughter with racist motives. What could I get for that? My confession counts though, hey? -They said it'll count. -15 years. But you're unlikely to get a life sentence. We'll go through everything. Please listen and answer all my questions. Fuck! 15 years? They caught them based on my confession? Without me, you'd still be pulling corpses out of shacks! Scratching at their incinerated bodies, right? You come here and you say 15 years? What 15 years? Who do you think you are? What 15 years? Answer me, don't fucking stare! Is that why you came here? What 15 years? 15 years? Fuck you! You can fuck yourselves with your 15 years! Let me go! I'm not a murderer! I'm not! 15 years! Lawyer scum! Fuck you! -What's that? -Dezademin... ...for fits of anger. He stopped taking them when he came in. I should have been there... with you It doesn't matter, I'm fine now. This is an identity parade, please answer clearly. If you recognise any of them, you should state the individual's number. You understand me? Bring them in! Number 1, stand up and step forward! Number 2, stand up and step forward! Number 3, stand up, step forward! Number 4, stand up and step forward! So? - That's him! - I can't hear you! - That's him! - What number? - That's him! - Please state the number! - It was him! - Please state the number, say the number! - One, two, three or four? - It was him! Do you know numbers? 1... 2... 3... 4... Which number? Number 3? Or number 4? Or number 2 or number 1? Enough! - Please state the number! - Call his family to collect him! This is the rule! You have to say the number! They're here. He's completely changed since he lost his mum. They said in school if things don't change, he'll have to go to a special home. He wouldn't survive there. He needs his dad. -He's all the poor kid's got left. -Where's his father? -He's in prison. He got two years. -What for? Stealing wood. Say when we get there, crowd's getting louder! Contact! Reinforcements needed at the rear entrance to the court! Come on, Nazi! Show your face! Murderer! We demand the court cite a racist man. We demand that the government ban Nazi paramilitary organizations! We want justice! Murderer! You'll burn in hell! We demand a fair sentence! -Hero! Hero! -Filthy Nazi bitch, law whore! You killed my son! He was only five! -My son was only five years old! Why... -Be quiet, ma'am and calm down! My son was only five years old! Rule the law! Murderer! -Are you hurt? Should I call a doctor? -It's nothing. No need. Pull yourself together and calm down. We're counting on you, don't let us down. Lean back! Give me that! -Wipe it. -Has it started? They're drifting in, you need to get changed! On the day of the accident... my daughter drew a picture of me.. It was called "Mummy's work". I was wearing a black gown. Because doctors have white coats and judges have black. She drew a prison next to me... with big bars on the windows, to stop the bad people from getting out. "But, Mummy..." she asked, "what if an innocent gets sent to prison?" "You'll defend them, right? You get them out of prison?" "That's my job," I told her. That's my job! Right now she wouldn't be proud of me. She wouldn't be proud. I'm giving the case back! I want that boy's file on my desk. Tomorrow! My wife says it's my kidneys. But I know it's my stomach. -You tried tea? -We're long past that. It sorted my sister out. You ready? We're ready. The defendant's legal representative will answer all your questions. There are certain things... Son! -Hi, Dad! -My dear son! Hi, Dad! Thank you very much! Thanks for everything! Come on son, let's go home! The fetus is healthy, developing well. I can't see any abnormalities. Its bones are the correct length and the organs are developing as well. And it's definite, it's a little girl. I'll leave you alone for a while. A couple more tests but nothing serious. -I suppose you'd like a copy. -Of course. Thanks! Thanks! Mum! I'm thirsty. Would you get me a glass of water? Sure! I'll be back in a minute. You'll be good. I know you will. I can feel it. I'm waiting for you. I can't wait. And... And you'll have to accept that you won't know your father. That'll be my secret. But I'll be here for you. Always... -Hello. -Hello. -Hello, where do we go? -Come with me. Come on, let's go. I can see you haven't stated whether you'd accept a Gypsy infant. Do you only want to adopt a white child? I won't judge you if the answer's no. Lots of people want blond children with blue eyes. But it would significantly shorten the process if you'd accept an underprivileged child. -We accept. -We accept. Come with me, please.
