THIS FILM IS A FICTION INSPIRED BY REAL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS The story I'm about to tell you took place at a time when the sky belonged to a select few. There were no low cost airlines. It wasn't like today. A plane was a plane, not a bus. It's a true story. Like all true stories, it contains a few lies. It's the story of a liar. The story of a man who fooled an entire country. SMOKE AND MIRRORS My name is Jesus Camoes. I was a pilot at the time I'm telling you about. I had money and prestige. I had no need to get involved in such matters. But it was fun. The sky belonged to a select few. So did the world. It's weird to see you dressed like that. I'm meeting my wife for lunch I want to impress her. I'm turning 53, it's time to change. This is Francisco Paesa. In 1995 we were involved in handing over the most wanted fugitive in the history of Spanish democracy. Have you looked at what's inside? This. It's a locker in the North Station in Paris. What will you do with that much money? What will we do. We'll see. He won't be out for a while. We have plenty of time to think about it. I'll be back in a month. Judge Ferrer will call you to testify. Don't worry, everything's in order. What if she asks me about you? Tell her the truth. That I'm your friend. An advance. I have to go. That was the last time I saw him. A few months later I got a call saying Paco was dead. But let's get back to the beginning of the story. Thank you. I need two SAM 7 missiles. For who? For ETA. During the most violent years of the ETA terrorist group Paco was sent to buy two missiles with homing beacons to lead police to the heart of the armed group. ETA's a hornet's nest, Paco. You should stay out of there. The pay is good. I could pay you better. You can't work only for the Spanish Secret Service. Having only one client will get you in trouble. It's my country. Money is your country. Don't fool yourself. And that of many others. 300,000 francs, up front. Give me a couple days, I'll see what I can do. A police operation in Hendaye in the Atlantic Pyrenees... It was the biggest raid ever on the terrorist group ETA. Part of their arsenal was found. And, more importantly, their system of blackmailing Basque businessmen was uncovered. From that moment on, Paco became one of ETA's biggest targets. Rafael! Rafael Vera, Head of State Security. - What's up, Paco? - How are you? Better known as The Gypsy. - They haven't paid you yet? - Not yet. That's odd. I'll call them right now and take care of it. They had promised him 100 million pesetas for the operation. Two years later, he still hadn't been paid. Hi, Paco. It's me. Your money has been sorted out. He was never paid. I've got something else for you. He was sent to blackmail a GAL witness. GAL: the Spanish government's anti-terrorist death squad. An easy job. He only had to convince her not to testify against her boyfriend and compromise the Spanish government. It was the only time Paco wasn't suspicious. As soon as Paco 's face was made public, nobody wanted anything to do with him. After that, he had to flee Spain for 5 years. When he came back, nothing was ever the same. Gentlemen, I want you to taste this wine. There are only 50 bottles in the world like it. Wonderful. - Spectacular. - I'm glad you like it. I had a bottle sent to each of you at your office. That leaves only 46. We brought the contracts. As agreed, I included a clause specifying each party's contribution. We can set up the company in Sao Tome. Off shore, of course. Being an ambassador has its perks. - It's a lot of money. - Fifty-fifty. Still, it's a lot of money. Nobody said getting rich was cheap. We brought something too. A file. - What file? - Not what file, whose file. A good file investigating someone is always a bad file. And that file proved that everything Paco had was fake. His million-dollar estate, an office in one of Madrid's nicest areas pending seizure, and a house in Las Rozas belonging to Gloria Villalba... This is the only thing that's his in this house. ...his wife of 15 years. Is it real? As far as his fortune... Two accounts in the red and a bank loan never granted that Paco punctually applied for every 3 months. We also know that you worked for the Spanish Secret Service. But that didn't go very well. They tricked him. Paco was set up. The pilot. He's your assistant, partner, - friend? - Jesus Camoes. You've known him for 20 years, he's married and has 2 kids. Quite a family man. I admit it. There was a time in my life when I was excessively sociable. You're not in jail because this gives you diplomatic immunity. A gift from your friend, George Starckmann, the weapons dealer. Forget the business world. With a life like yours, you should write a book. Don't worry, we won't call the police. Get out. Don't drink that, you'll get sick. Pour me some. The only thing the file missed was an old Jaguar in his name. Besides that car, Paco had lost everything. Hi. I put your things in the bedroom downstairs. You can use it until you find something else. That was Paco 's life until Luis Roldan showed up. THE SIDEKICK Luis Roldan, the Spanish Police Commissioner. In charge of more than 70 thousand men. One of the most respected members of the government. Relentless in the fight against ETA. Hand-picked to be the next Minister of the Interior. I'm sorry. I had an important call to make. Your ash. Julian says you get along well with money. Like any other relationship. We have our moments. How are things right now? It depends what for. Imagine you have to save an account that's in danger. Where is this account? Switzerland. - Where did the money come from? - You're in the money business and you have moral prejudice? Please, get to the point. I asked the wrong question. How much money? Quite a bit. And there are two houses we want to keep. One in Paris and the other in the French West Indies. Can you handle that as well? Perhaps. That's not good enough. Can you or not? Put out your cigarette. I can do it for one million dollars. That's a lot of money. We're good. There's something else. A serious inconvenience. Information will come to light that's harmful to me. What does it say? Something you wouldn't like said about you. Is it true? This is Spain. Would that change anything? - When is it coming out? - Soon. We need to be ready. And please, be precise. We don't have much time. You should leave the country at once. A little distance is always a good thing. Sergeant, bring that rabble to order. Yes, sir. First division, step forward. You're disobeying a direct order. Yes? Yes, Minister, sir. No, no, I was reading. Of course I know about the committee. Don't worry, Antoni. You can call me to testify anytime. I won't leave Madrid. I promise. That lie would force the Minister of the Interior, Antonio Asuncion, to resign. - Where are we? - We just passed Perpignan. - Want me to drive a bit? - No, I'm okay. Go back to sleep. I have an apartment in Paris. You can stay as long as you need while we sell the houses and see what we do with that money. If you don't like it, I can put you somewhere else. Don't try to be modest, you're no good at it. - Do you know the neighbors? - They're Dutch. They're away. They're almost always out of town. That's Hans. My assistant. Your assistants are all so discreet. I know that today is your anniversary. Congratulations. I booked you a table at a very special restaurant. The reservation is at 7:30. Hans can take you and bring you back. How did you know it was our anniversary? It's my job. That was one of Paco's better skills. Know more about people than even they did. Thank you. Here's the key. Call me if you need anything. Enjoy your dinner. - I'm going to change. - Okay. IN CASE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET HER ANYTHING. HOPE SHE LIKES THEM - PACO Do you trust him? We have no choice. What if he keeps it all for himself? He's a friend of Julian's. Julian would never do that. You're here with me. Nothing will happen to you. You look beautiful in that blouse. I'm pregnant. Come here. Luis, please. You're embarrassing me. Sit down. Is that yours? Happy anniversary. They're beautiful. First we'll secure the houses. We'll see what we do with the money. The strategy to save Roldan's houses was simple. He only needed someone with little or nothing to lose. Better nothing. Basically, a slave. In this case, he chose Americo Casturelli. Americo Casturelli. Lawyer. Almost a lawyer. Nice to meet you. Please, sit down. When did you arrive? That doesn't concern you. Here are the contracts. Majority and only shareholder of the Omerlade Investment Group, You can speak French, I understand it perfectly. The houses are magnificent. I'm happy to buy them from you. Especially with your own money. Don't give me that German look. I haven't had a drink in two years. Two years? Two months. Believe me. It's true! And it was. How's your mother? She's doing better. Give her my best. Yes. At the same time, Casturelli's company would sell the properties to two other companies. The first, Tunisa, was in the name of Jean Pierre Pinaud. The slave of the slave. A down-on-his-luck stockbroker who lost clients faster than furniture. Where is all your stuff? Did you get robbed? Not at all. I'm changing the decor. I'm painting over there, over there too. I'll add a nice painting... How is Paco? Fine. He says hi. The other company buying, was in the name of Darijus Arlaukas. Hi. - How are you? - Fine, and you? This is Casturelli. Casturelli, Darijus. The sole administrator of a company located in Panama not even he knew the name of. The slave of the slave of the slave. You want something to eat? Okay, gentlemen. Sorry for the delay. Everything is in order. A few days later, a notary legally buried that mess of loans, sales and acquisitions. If the police ever found Roldan's houses, someone would always claim the properties as payment for a loan. Thank you. My pleasure. Roldan's houses were safe. And so was Paco. We're good. One more thing. People are lying about me. I want you to get me an interview with El Mundo. I know a lot of things and I can prove them. If they come after me, I'll go after them. I want them to know. The government, the opposition party, even the royal family. Nobody is safe. You already have enough enemies, don't you think? You shouldn't add any more to the list. It isn't safe. Please do as I ask. In that case, I would recommend publishing it on May 1st. People read the paper more on holidays. The ex-police commissioner is suspected of... 1.2 million pesetas a month in mortgages with a salary of 600,000. A financial magician. Formal charges against Roldan, including tax crimes... Embezzling public funds... Accused of having embezzled reserves from the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Police have requested his passport be withdrawn... Police suspect that he's fled the country and some even say with compromising documents. I have two alternatives. Either shoot myself or come clean and tell the truth. And when I say come clean, I mean with all the consequences. Absolutely all of them. They won't trick me like they did Amedo. If I go to prison, I won't go alone. I'll take them all with me. What are you going to do with the memoirs you're writing? Right now, write... - How's it going? - They're finishing up. Did he take off his sport coat? No. He'll get dehydrated in this heat. Don't worry. He drank 4 cans of Coca-Cola and a bottle of water. Do you know her? She's a tough judge. JUDGE FERRER CALLS ROLDAN TO TESTIFY She's a woman. She has to be. - When's his court date? - Tomorrow. What are you going to do? What do you suggest? Nine counts would be a lot of jail time. You can add. Congratulations. I don't pay you to say the obvious. You're supposed to be smarter than me. I'm sorry. Luis can't go back there. He's not well. I'm afraid of what he might do. I can put you in touch with someone who can help you disappear for a while. That's better. I'm not used to your way of asking for things. - How much? - A lot. - And I'm not used to your answers. - It's dangerous. A lot of people want him dead. And more after this. He's accusing everyone. Are you proposing we run? Until when? Until you come up with a better idea? I'll testify. They could arrest you. No, they can't. They have nothing on me. Those are very pretty. They're herons. The Greeks said they represented beauty, balance and wisdom. He couldn't have picked them better. Luis told me you're pregnant. Don't leave any loose ends. They're naming a new police commissioner next week. You know what that means? No. Get to the point. It means that the new commissioner will be able to access your husband's account in Switzerland. You have to trust me, or you'll lose everything. Thank you very much. I'll see you out. Can we have a moment alone? I'm a bad person. No, you're not. Why do you say that? - Am I a bad person? - Of course not. - I'm a bad person. - Honey, it's okay. - I'm a bad person. - It's okay. It's okay. Those earrings look great on you. What do they mean? Do they have any special meaning? That I love you. How is Luis? Nervous. He's terrified of being alone. He won't be alone. Don't worry. I hope not. I talked to Luis. He'll transfer the money to your Aresbank account tomorrow. How much money is it? 1.5 billion pesetas. 1.5 billion pesetas in government commissions and reserve funds. Quite a blow to the Spanish Treasury. What about the briefcase? You should keep it somewhere safe. That information is your life insurance. What briefcase? Luis and Nieves wouldn't see each other again until one year later. Nieves was accused of misprision of felony and sent to prison in Brieva, where she found inmates imprisoned by her husband. When they offered her an isolated cell she said that she didn't need to isolate herself from anyone. 1,200 people live in this tower. You'll be safe here. Nobody will notice you. Hans will be here for anything you need. If you want to contact me, call me and hang up after 3 rings. We're good. What's wrong with your apartment, Pinaud? It's being remodeled. It won't be ready until next month. I finally decided to redo the kitchen. Besides the kitchen, I told them to redo the floor. So it will take some time, that's always the case. You always know when these things begin, but never when they'll finish. How is Paco? Fine, I think. He doesn't know I'm here. I just came by to say hi. Almost lawyer. 24 hours after Luis Roldan deposited his money in Paco's account, the money had already traveled around the world twice. From Madrid to Geneva... Hello. Hello. I'd like to make a transfer. From Geneva to Singapore. From Singapore to Frankfurt. From Frankfurt to London. From London back to Singapore. They called it "riding the helicopter." It was like making the money disappear. Good morning. Good morning. Where's Hans? Inside. The German made coffee, you want some? No, thanks. He's a little shy, isn't he? Does he ever talk? He doesn't like to talk. And his Spanish is weak. I like people quiet people. They're smarter. They think while the rest of us yap too much. My father was like that. I remember when I told him I was going into politics he said: "Luis, son, stay out of trouble." And I naively responded: "Come on, Dad. Spain needs to be like France, like Germany, like England... A democracy. Why should we be any different?" And he answered: "Because the people who live here are Spanish." Where is it? My money. Don't think you'll keep it for yourself. I know you moved it, I would have done the same. It's in Singapore. Is that safe? Yes. You're a smart man. Because you know that if they catch me, they'll go after you. We're handcuffed to each other. This is my lawyer's number. He's expecting your call. Call him and tell him everything he needs to know. He'll check to see that the money's still there. How is my wife? She's fine. You're going back to Madrid, right? I need you to get me a TV and VCR before you leave. I've made a list of movies and novels for you to get me. There you go. I have to make the most of my time. The ex-police commissioner's escape has caused a crisis in the government. Antonio Asuncion has resigned as Minister of the Interior. The Spanish Prime Minister is in an uncomfortable situation. The opposition party is calling for new elections. The president will appear before Congress to explain the situation created by Luis Roldan's escape. The Ministry of the Interior has intensified the search and has requested collaboration with Interpol. THE EXPERT IN THERMONUCLEAR CENTERS TWO MONTHS LATER Good morning. - Are you Francisco Paesa? - Yes, that's me. I'm Inspector Gonzalez, Madrid Judicial Police. My assistant, Deputy Inspector Bermejo. - Nice house. - It isn't mine. - Would you like something to drink? - No, thank you. Please, sit down. We're investigating Luis Roldan's disappearance and we'd like to ask you a few questions. I don't know if I'll be much help. I only know what I read in the papers. In the press, according to the government's erratic and expensive investigation, Roldan had been seen all over the world. This proved two things. First, that Roldan was everywhere and nowhere. Second, that to most of the world, all Spaniards looked just like Roldan. Police. Identification, please. In only three months, Roldan had become the world's most wanted Spanish fugitive. Hey, I'm Spanish! We know he visited your office a few days before he disappeared. What office? Your office on Ortega y Gasset. Where did you get that information? Do you know Jesus Camoes? Goodbye. Was that...? - That was his wife? - Yes. - Pretty, huh? - And smart. He told someone at a family wedding. Sweetie, go sit with Mommy. He didn't know he was telling a police officer's wife. I saw him a couple of times. He needed advice on how to set up a company. You haven't seen him since? What does Jesus Camoes say? We know Roldan called Spain 3 times from an apartment of yours in Paris. Don't use the phone. It's not safe. We're good. Don't worry. Bye, Mom. What are you doing? Nothing. Getting a glass of water. Go back to bed. That's possible. He was in Paris in April and he stayed in my apartment. He might have used the phone. I haven't heard from him since. Does the name Casturelli ring a bell? Casturelli? Good morning. Good morning. What can I get you, sir? Tonic water with a slice of lemon, no ice. That evening his flight to Gibraltar was delayed by an electrical storm. Would you like anything else? That flight hadn't been delayed more than 5 hours in a long time. He never took it. Mineral water, please. No ice. In a small glass. What are they drinking? Give me a shot of that too. I'm going to try it. You only live once. But just one. Just to try it. Only one. My God! He was picked up drunk at Bern Airport with 300,000 Swiss francs in a briefcase. He got 5 years in prison for currency smuggling. He should have gotten 15, but he told the judge about the job he did for Paco Paesa and Luis Roldan. And he told him about 1.5 billion pesetas. Francisco Paesa. 1.5 billion. Does that ring a bell? We know you have an account in Singapore with 1.5 billion pesetas. I don't count it every night. Where did you get 1.5 billion pesetas? I don't have to answer that. It's exactly the amount Roldan took. A coincidence. A lot of coincidences, don't you think? How many coincidences does it take to be a lot? It's my money, Inspector. It's not Roldan's. Just in case, Judge Ferrer has asked them to freeze your account in Singapore. She's wasting her time, they'll never do it. Singapore law won't allow it. - You don't know the judge. - And I hope I never meet her. After Casturelli's testimony, Paco's diplomatic immunity as Ambassador to Sao Tome was endangered. Without that protection, they would accuse him again of extorting a GAL witness. - Where are you going? - Paris. But I'm coming back. I've heard that one before. - It's the last time. - That one too. Go anywhere you want. I'm bored of waiting for you. You've gone and left so many times I don't know if I want you to come back. I'm telling you the truth. That takes a lot of practice and you haven't got any. Don't forget the painting. Have a good trip. He didn't say a word about my mistake. And I didn't find out what was really happening until some time later. I told you we needed to be careful with that drunk. You should wear this. You know what it is? I was Police Commissioner. Of course I know what it is. That's not the question. The question is why. To stop bullets. Do you know anyone in Venezuela? My mother lives there. Why? The Spanish police are looking for you there too. They've asked the Venezuelan police to collaborate. They want you dead or alive. Is my mother all right? Yes, she is. The rules have changed. - What do you suggest? - Professionals. - I thought you were a professional. - Another kind. An international organization. I know several that can help you. I've spoken to your wife and she agrees. You can go back too. Don't be ridiculous. I'm not turning myself in. You need protection, Luis. Believe me. Hired guns, right? I don't need them, or this. ETA tried to kill me 3 times and I survived. I'm not afraid of the Spanish police. It's not just the police. Nobody. Okay. We need to make you a passport just in case. Have you got a photo we can use? Do you mind the music? I never mind Brahms. Turn it up. Drive more slowly. - What's wrong? - Nothing, don't worry. Turn when I say. Now. They're gone. Relax. It was a false alarm. It was like 3 or 4 in the morning. I was reading before I went to bed. Alexandre Dumas. Lately it's the only thing that relaxes me. I wouldn't have thought about it but one minute later I heard someone trying to break in. Stay here. Hans. Wait here, please. Jesus, stay with him, don't let him leave. Where are you going? I'm not leaving. Pierre and Marie Roland. I've known them for years. They say they were alone the whole night. My answer is yes. To your suggestion. The hired guns. Contact them. Now. Would you mind turning off the heat? It is off. Take off your trench coat. I'm okay like this. Relax. I am relaxed. Get your head down. I said get your head down. Don't let me out of your sight. You can't come with me. Stay here. Where are you going? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You want to get killed? Are you okay? Get in the car. They're waiting for you. Does my wife know where I'm going? Only they know. From this moment on, I won't have any more contact with you. If you talk to her, tell her I'm waiting for her. Please. Luis, you can still change your mind. Your money. Good luck. Thank you. You too. What about the 1.5 billion? We already have our money. That man is a time bomb. I want to be far away when he goes off. You're getting old, Paco. Totally the opposite. He was in great shape. We were exactly where Paco wanted us to be. Luis Roldan's whereabouts remain unknown. He's Spain's most wanted fugitive, sought by 140 officers in 12 countries on 4 continents. What is this man looking for? Extraterrestrials, a parking spot or Luis Roldan? The Ministry of the Interior has not ruled out any hypothesis. He was helped by at least one other person. A Civil Guard general, a drug trafficker and a member of the Italian mafia. He's protected by an underground network of mercenaries who transport fugitives from one country to another. Roldan is in hotter water than ever before. DRACULA'S COACHMAN THREE MONTHS LATER Yes? Captain? You have a call. - Yes? - It's me, where are you? About to land in Rome. When can we meet? In two days, why? My friend from Zaragoza isn't well. - What's wrong with him? - His head. He hasn't seen anyone for too long. - Where is he? - I don't know. They got in touch with me through Stuart. They asked me to negotiate his return with Dracula's Coachman. I'll be there in 5 hours. There. - Minister, sir. - Please, sit down. Thank you. This report was prepared by my client Francisco Paesa about Luis Roldan's situation. I won't touch it. - You read it. - It's quite extensive. Summarize. First of all, my client complains that whenever he works for the Ministry he gets in trouble. It happened with ETA and the GAL and he doesn't want it to happen again. So before negotiating, he wants you to drop the lawsuits and for the judges to find some other amusement. Leave him alone and let him come back without any trouble. How am I supposed to do that? You're the Minister of Justice. Justice and the Interior. The most powerful minister in the government and with the most ambition to be president. What does he say about Luis Roldan? What do you say about his conditions? Tell him yes. But first I want The Sidekick. The file. He says he's being protected by an international organization and that he can contact them to negotiate the conditions of his return. When? That's the wrong adverb, sir. First is how much. How much? 300 million. That's a lot of money. It depends on how badly you want to win elections. Or be president. It's the perfect opportunity to oust your competitors and at the same time clean your party's image. Keep in mind the price increases every day that passes. Coincidentally, like Roldan, Belloch was from Zaragoza. They called him Dracula's Coachman. He's one of Stuart's men. That file must be Roldan's final conditions for his surrender. - Good evening. - Good evening. The conditions of Luis Roldan's surrender. Summarize. Two weeks from now. In Laos. Laos? They have no extradition treaty with Spain. It's perfect. It will be an administrative extradition. Not an arrest. He'll only be charged with bribery and embezzlement. Spain will have to negotiate your surrender, you'll do less time. How long? Five years, tops. We're good. All right. It's okay, Paco. It's me. Don't hold me to this, but I'm glad to see you. Have you ever seen me with a gun? Spanish spies only carry a checkbook. I don't need to see it to know you're packing. - What do you want? - I'll be straight with you. I have to catch a flight in one hour. Where is he? Who? You know exactly who. Who sent you, Minister Belloch? A lot of people in the government are looking for Roldan. And which side are you on? The good side, Paco. Always the good side, you know that. Who are they? - The moving truck. - A moving truck? They're not ours. I haven't seen him since he was here with his wife. When? And the red car? Not us either. Months ago. I don't know where he is. I hope you're not lying. And not to see you again soon. For your own good. I'm only warning you. Have a good trip. Pier Marie Laperrouze. Of course I know him. I sold him and his associate weapons a couple years ago. A guy named Rene. He's a bounty hunter. People are nervous in your country. This is serious, Paco. What kind of trouble are you in now? I don't know if I can help you, Paco. I'm waiting for a pardon from Mitterrand and my hands are tied. I'm getting out. And you should settle down too. You're getting older. Do like me. Take your grandson to a museum. Get some botox, write a book. I'm writing my memoirs. Did I tell you? Double. I have a friend in the Mossad. I'll talk to him. For now, move across the street from the Israeli embassy. It's the safest place in France. The orchid mantis is a wonder of mimicry. The individuals of this species don't hide to remain unseen among the orchids. Instead they adopt the appearance of these flowers taking on their same color and shape. They also imitate the petals of the orchids, which when completely still, the insects don't detect the deception and fall directly into the trap. Suddenly I realized what was happening. In the game of evolution, the winners are usually the specialists. - When did you change the lock? - A while ago. Hi, son. - Why aren't you at school? - I have a sore throat. Well... How's the handball going? I quit two years ago, Dad. You look taller. You've changed the place. It looks nice. Where's your mother? She didn't sleep here. Did he buy that TV? Mom put your things in the pool shed. Who are you? Please, put down the knife. Why are you following me? What do you want? You don't remember me? I'm Paco Paesa's friend. The pilot. We met at John's marriage. Shit. The pilot. Yes. Come on, I'll take a look at that in the shop. Hi, Pascal. Hi. Come in. Look who's here. Alain Prost. What's up, Jesus? Come in. From Pascal. You're early. The match starts in 45 minutes. - What match? - Real Madrid. Microphones. - You're a son of a bitch. - Wait. You've been lying to me all along with your spy stories. Jesus... Last night I remembered John's wedding. Or should I stay Stuart, and his friend who sells cheese. It's all a lie. There's no international organization. You made it all up. Look at that. - They've been following me for 3 weeks. - They could be your friends. Go down and ask them. They won't be very friendly. - Who sent them? - I don't know. Anyone looking for Roldan, dead or alive. That's why we're safe here. - Where is Roldan? - I can't tell you. - You'd be in trouble if you knew. - Let me decide that. - I can't tell you. - Why not? Because you can't keep your mouth shut. I know you said you saw Roldan in my office? Hello? What happened? Luis? It's me! Luis? Luis? It's me. Luis? I couldn't go through with it. I can't. I can't even do that right. Let's go. I'll be right there. You wanted to know where Roldan is, right? - Come with me. - But no more tricks. You have my word. And you, keep your mouth shut. I will. Not that car, they know it. Help me. Here. I'll lie down in the back seat. Luis Roldan, Spain's most wanted criminal, who had been seen on five continents, had never left Paris. What did I tell you? I said not to bring him Spanish press. Throw it away. Throw it away. I know what I did is wrong. I'm not a criminal. I've done a lot of good things for my country. I have a family. They can't treat me like this. I only did what everyone was doing. I won't turn myself in. I'm the laughingstock of the whole country. They'll crucify me. Are you sure? Whatever you do, I need your consent to move the money. Singapore isn't safe. We have to physically withdraw it and put it in another account so there's no electronic trail. I know someone who can do it. Someone I completely trust. If you don't turn yourself in, you have to disappear. And that means never seeing your wife again, or your family, or your unborn son. A new life, with nothing from your old one. That's the only way. And you know what it's like to be alone. Is that what you want? If it is, it can be done. First people will have to think you're dead. It's the only way they'll stop looking for you. I can help you fake your death. We'll take you to some quiet country in Southeast Asia and get you a foreign passport. Somewhere you can live in peace. I can talk to your lawyer and send you money every month. As much as you need. You're rich, Luis. Please, I wish to be alone. Ludovico. - How long has he been here? - Four months. He won't last much longer. My order. Luis. Mrs. Gerve is dying. I've been watching her die for three months. What do you want? I think you should take this. Trust me. Yes? - Hi. - Luis? Luis? Hi. Darling... - How are you? - Fine, and you? - I really want to see you. - Fine. Thanks for the call. I want control over that account. You'll have it. How? Trusting my word. Your lawyer is waiting for you to call and give your consent. I don't want your money, Luis. You pay me enough. It's your money and you'll keep it. Trust me. Remember, you're handcuffed to me. If I go down, you go down with me. I'm going back. I can't live without my wife and family. They're all I care about. I'll call my lawyer. - Yes? - Hi, it's me. Hi, Paco. Were you asleep? No, I just got home. What do you want? I wanted to talk to you. - What for? - I'm tired. - Tired of what? - Of this. Of everything. I want us to be like we were at the beginning. For everything to be like it was. That's not possible, Paco. Why not? I have money. I have a lot of money. We can live however we want as long as we want. I don't believe you don't love me anymore. - How much money? - A lot. It's late, Paco. I'm going to bed. That's Beatriz, Paco's niece. She's exactly like him. A daughter to him. - Did you say anything to my sister? - No. Hi, Jesus. Hi, Beatriz. I'll show you your room. - When do I leave? - Tomorrow. Where, Switzerland? - Singapore. - Singapore is expensive. When have you ever paid for anything? You'll go to the bank every morning and withdraw 4 stacks like these. How much is in each stack? About 50 million pesetas. 200 million per briefcase. A little more. I'm going to the hotel. - Need anything? - No, thanks, Jesus. Oh, yes. Jesus. Don't forget the stamps. The next morning, you'll go back and deposit the money in another account. - Another bank? - The same one. Two floors up. I hope I don't get lost. In one week you'll have withdrawn the 1.5 billion pesetas. Always travel by taxi. From the hotel to the bank and straight back to the hotel. Call me when you've made the last deposit. Is it legal? Completely legal. - Are you sure? - You should know. I paid for your law degree for a reason. Whose money is it? I want double what you were going to pay me. Excuse me. Please, don't stop. Keep walking. I know you're Jesus Camoes. You're friends with Francisco Paesa. You work for him. Who are you? I work for Minister Belloch. I want the route Roldan is taking from Laos. I'll give you 100 million pesetas to get it for me. My phone number is in your pocket. Call me on Friday at 2:30 P.M. Be punctual. There were two reasons they wanted Roldan's route. First, an arrest is worth a lot more than someone turning himself in. The second, it left Paco on the sidelines. - How was your trip? - Boring. We'll take you to Disney World later. The meeting with the Laotian ambassador is in half an hour. Roldan's extradition papers. Are you okay? I'll be back in 20 minutes. Bad night? I'm not used to sleeping alone. There he is. Here you go. The extradition papers signed by the Laotian government. If you've never been to Paris, you have a couple days to see it. You're flying to Laos next week. Here, this is for you. What is it? Singapore accepted Judge Ferrer's request. In two weeks we'll know if she can access your account or not. I warned you. - Have you finished? - Please. - Thank you. - Excuse me. Shall I take your plate, sir? I'm finished, thank you. I changed the route. It's all in there. No, not here. Put it away. You leave at dawn. You'll fly in a private jet and you're the pilot. Tell the police we're moving it forward. Their tickets are in there too. They'll take a commercial flight. First class. I don't want them complaining. You should quit smoking. That cough is sounding worse. Does a cough ever sound good? I'm going to the men's room. Those 3 lines were worth 100 million pesetas. The most expensive lines in the world. This is Jesus Camoes. I'm not interested. My answer is no. How are you? Everything okay? Fine. The usual. My wife is bored and making my life hell. How are your kids? It was the first time that Paco had asked about my family. - Good. Growing up. - Your dessert, sir. The best dessert in Paris. I never found out if Belloch's proposal was real or if Paco was testing me. Whatever it was, at that moment I felt like I had passed. With time, I discovered that I was wrong. OPERATION LUNA Your passport. Thank you. Thanks for respecting my first name. You'll fly with Jesus and Hans to Bangkok, where two Laotian policemen will hand you over to the Spanish police and they'll take you back to Madrid. Like we agreed, it's not an arrest. In less than 3 years you'll be playing in the park with your son. We're good. I left your bulletproof vest in the bedroom. Have a good trip. I'll wait downstairs. You're taking that with you? Don't be foolish, Luis. They'll take it from you the moment you set foot in Spain. And you need it, believe me. It's life insurance for you and your family. Let me hold onto it for you. You still don't trust me? Would you trust someone like me? I see myself in you. Please, don't make me judge myself. I already have the whole country doing it for me. I've never judged you. All in clue time. We're not in a hurry anymore. I wish you the best, Luis. Thanks for everything, Paco. The 25 yards from the door to the car seemed eternal. We were transporting a man everyone wanted dead or alive. Someone could come out of any window, of any balcony or any shadow, and put an end to it all. Being close to him put us in the same place. In the middle of the same crosshairs. You should get your head down. I'm fine like this. Good morning. Good morning. That morning, from the airport with the least surveillance in all of Paris, a private jet was to take off heading to Rome. Rented by a businessman named Hans Henry. The plane would be piloted by Captain Jesus Camoes and his co-pilot, Luis Ibañez. All right. Bon voyage. Thank you very much. Beatriz had been erasing all traces of Roldan's money withdrawing it in cash. Paco never told his niece that if they granted the Spanish government's request, anyone who touched that account could be arrested. Or that it was Singapore's last day to decide on the matter. Wait here a moment. - Thank you. - Go in. Something to drink? A Coca-Cola. I have money, can I get you something? No, thank you. You have to write them before we leave to send them from Laos. They're for your wife. "Laos. The country of a million elephants." That was true. Although there were only 500 left. And take this money. It's Laotian. Your story will be more believable. We're good. Very ingenious. Can you leave me alone to write them? - I'll get your Coca-Cola. - Thank you. Roldan would be remembered as the man arrested in Laos. Those postcards were as close as he would ever get to that country. The money, Roldan's 1.5 billion, was safe. And in Paco's hands. Yes? They just deposited the 300 million for Roldan. Thank you. We have to go. This is for Paco. Give it to him when you get to Madrid. He's expecting it. And tell him yes, I trust him. What he's after is in a locker in the North Station in Paris. Tell him he'll have to trust me. Let's go. Give me a second. They're Laotian police. Captain Khan and Inspector Mei. They have to escort us. Goodbye. That was the end. After 310 days in hiding, Roldan could go back to Spain. - Yes? - It's over, Paco. You can go back to Spain anytime. Hi. Hi. It's over. I'll never leave again. I was about to have a glass of wine. - Would you like one? - Yes. The minister gave a press conference to inform about Operation Luna, which ended with Luis Roldan's arrest. We received convincing information that Luis Roldan was in Laos, the Laotian government contacted our ministry assuring us that the information was correct and we asked them to proceed with his arrest and to hand him over to us. Roldan was arrested and charged with all the crimes Spain had accused him of. You're making a mistake. We have a deal. I signed an agreement with the Spanish government. Francisco Paesa has emerged as the Judas who turned the fugitive over to the police, but Minister Belloch chose not to reveal his possible involvement in Roldan's capture. The Spanish government has never made any deal. We don't make deals and we don't negotiate. And I think it's good news that our institutions work. In less than a year, Paco had gotten everything back. He could have stopped there, but Paco would never do that. LAOTIAN GOVERNMENT SPANISH GOVERNMENT This came for you. You have to come and get something. Right away. - Julian Blanco? - Yes. This is for you. TH E LAOTIAN PAPERS That junkie Pinaud screwed up again. - Why? - The seal is from City Hall in Laos, not the Laotian Ministry. What should I do, return it? The Laotian government confirmed that Luis Roldan's extradition documents were forged. It's perfect. I'll be back in 20 minutes. Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Yes? - The men's room, please? - Yes, down there. There you go. The extradition papers signed by the Laotian government. THE COUNTRY OF A MILLION ELEPHANTS The one at the register. Captain Khan. He's Vietnamese. Vietnamese? Yeah, but he served in the military. And he's a gentleman. He's a cripple. He's a cripple. I knew you'd like it. Laos also confirmed that Roldan never entered the country and therefore there was never any arrest. - What's wrong? - Nothing. In fact, nobody had ever spoken to them. What's the other guy's name? Inspector Mei. Very good. Laos hasn't ruled out that Roldan's arrest might have been a secret mission. We don't know any Captain Kahn. No Laotian police officer handed him over in Bangkok. Was it an arrest or a surrender? We never granted his extradition. We've found no trace of his presence in Laos. Many people are calling for Belloch to resign, claiming that the minister was tricked. The former police commissioner claims he was fooled. What's going on? That's the question Spaniards are asking. His surrender to authorities, unlike what was previously thought, has not calmed the political climate in this country. ROLDAN NEGOTIATED HIS RETURN THROUGH LIMITED EXTRADITION It was all a lie. Minister, sir, they're waiting for you at the press conference. That was the end of Belloch's spectacular run for the presidency. That was the beginning of the end of everything. Can't you knock like everybody else? It's a habit. Have a seat. What do you want? I came to make sure you'd left. Well, now you can see. I guess I came too soon. Next time I'll come later. This is my second warning, Paco. You can come anytime. You're in trouble, Paco. I have Roldan's documents. You can't touch me. I don't believe you. I don't think you'll dare to find out. You know there's nothing in those documents. They won't protect you from the law. Unless you want to spend your life in prison, you know what you have to do: disappear. And we both know what that means: No more Gloria. No more Spain. A new life with nothing from the previous one. Disappear, Paco. You have no choice. Goodbye, Paco. That was the last time Paco saw Gloria. Have you looked at what's inside? This. It's a locker in the North Station in Paris. What will you do with that much money? What will we do. We'll see. He won't be out for a while. We have plenty of time to think about it. I'll be back in a month. Judge Ferrer will call you to testify. Don't worry, everything's in order. What if she asks me about you? Tell her the truth. That I'm your friend. Yes? Hello, Jesus. On July 21st, 1998, Paco's niece called me to say that her uncle had just died of a heart attack in Bangkok. Hi, Hans. I came to bring you Paco's things. He said that if anything ever happened to him to bring you flowers. I didn't know what kind to get. Thank you, Hans. They're pretty. Roldan was put on trial for all his crimes and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He was placed in solitary confinement in the same prison where his wife had been. He served 15 years in jail. Hey, Alejandro! Come to Daddy. Nieves separated from Luis a few months after their second child was born. Yes? Jesus, how are you? Who is this? Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre who? Pinaud. Jean-Pierre Pinaud. Hi, Jean-Pierre. It's been a long time. How are you? Better than ever. Casturelli's dead. One week after he got out of jail, they found him at home shot in the head. These things happen, huh? There's something else. What? It's Paco. I accidentally called him the other day and I got his voicemail. Paco's dead. Why does a dead man's voicemail still work? Dead people don't get calls from the living. Jesus? Never mind that, it doesn't matter. Of course not. Maybe I'm more dead than alive and that's why I hear it. These things happen. Okay, but... that's not why I'm calling. Can you loan me some money, Jesus? Not a lot, just a little bit. He was right. These things happened. They found him on the bed of the room he was living in. He hadn't even taken off his shoes. Hello, this is Francisco Paesa's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. Like I said at the beginning, this is the story of a man who fooled an entire country. He fooled me as well. Except for a Lithuanian cook whose whereabouts were unknown, I was the only one who could tell it. For a time, I tried to follow Paco's footsteps. You might say I was unlucky. - Miss. - Yes? Are there any free seats in first class? But there's no point. I'm not like him. I never was. With time I found out that the world I'd seen from above, belonged to only a few. In this story, I was only a pilot. In 2004, right after the statute of limitations had passed on his crimes, Paco was found alive. Paco? When they found him, he said he had retired and was living off his savings. He never called me. I'm not Paco.
