I haven't died yet. Of course I haven't died yet. "Worst By Chance" Miss Kawasaki Yumi, the result isn't that bad. I think it's mainly because of the stress. Ever heard of Obsessional-Compulsive Neurosis? I know what it is. Anyone at home with the same disease? I read it in a book. In your case, let's see, a lot of women have it. Bulimia or Anorexia, you heard of it? I know it. How much do you throw up a day? A lot. I'll inject some penicillin, don't be afraid, you'll be alright. I am not afraid. Oh, then you must be ashamed of it. Why should I? Oh, okay. Oh, you got me? Let's go over there. To a good place? Yah, real good place! I don't want to go now. No way, come on! Come with me, come. Everyone's watching, don't pull. Come over here. No! Come here! So many kids like you around here. I had enough! Which school are you from? I said which school? Come over here. No! Hey, boy with glasses! What? Can you let him go this time? No way! Wait, wait. Alright, I'll let him go. Thank you. Hey, you were good! By the way, doesn't it hurt? Oh... it hurts! Ouch! Ouch! You wanted to stab him, right? No no no, it's bad to stab people. Hey you! Something's really kaput in you. No, nothing's kaput, nothing. Fairly kaput, I say. You really are an idiot. Idiot? What happened? Why? Taro! You are so cute! This is Kaneshiro. Wow , handsome! Look over there, she is Kaori. Here, she is Naoko. Yumi here. Yumi, laugh a bit, say something! Never mind. Okay, I am Mayumi, the main character here! Quick, come on. Quick, come on. Stop it. It's okay. Hey, where do you live? Don't bother me. I am not into these things. Why? Mine is really big! Shut up. I said I have a big thing. Kishimura, it's out of fashion to say that. Out of fashion? You two are the same. Don't try to show off. Always thinking of how to get laid! Did I try to show off? Maybe you were like that before you were born. Stop it now, enough is enough. Should I bowl this time? No, I'll bowl, have a seat first. Hey, hold this for me. What are you doing? Something's wrong with you? Hey you! You really are a gloomy person. I was just wondering... why are you here? Good, good... Good punchline! Everyone here is the same kind of rubbish! What are you? Is he your boss? I am just a Korean. So what? Is that your weapon? Your last weapon? Worthless worm you are! Hey, look whose here! The “just a Korean“ guy, Mr. Kaneshiro! Kaneshiro! Nice hairstyle! Right! This is me! Right, right, this jerk isn't expelled yet from the school! Are you an idiot? Why are you crying like a baby? If you have time to cry. Why don't you fight back? You keep quiet! Hidenori, how do they bully you? Nothing special. They call you “Chosenjin“ and tell you to go back to “Chosen“, right? Be quiet! I've been bullied more than a million times, so I know! Wait... I hate Chosenjin and Korean, but the Japanese I hate the most! Hey, just keep quiet for a while! Is it true, Hidenori? Maybe... Are you crying because you were told that you are a “Chosenjin“? No, not “Chosenjin“. It's Korean. For Japanese, both are the same thing. You are a Korean, that's the fact! Why should you be sad when you are told the fact? Why so distressed and shameful? I don't know. Then people born blind or with no arms and legs. Should they be ashamed of themselves too? Then why do they bully me? Those are the bad ones. They are wrong. You fight back! They deserve to be beaten up! God is here for you and your mom is also here for you! The “fact“ and “the things you can't do anything about“ are strangely alike. From that time on, I was forgiven. Even when I beat those guys up. Hey, Kaneshiro. Kaneshiro, are you okay? No strength. Verve those from “Chosen“ High School? Never mind... No way, come on, you should fight back! That's the basic of everything! No, I can't, they are strong. Ouch! You should attend classes. Classes? Yes. In my case, I just need to live life without any mistakes. The way that it was fixed for me. Actually, those fates are already there when you are born. Kind of pitiful to think this way but... Well, never mind... see you. Let me help! Oh excuse me, thank you. I'll give a hand too! Be careful, your leg! Thank you. Okay? Yes, fine. Thank you. Were these goods all won by you? Yes, they were. This is cool. Oh, yeah? How much? Not for sale lady! Look! This is cute! I have telephone cards on sale. I also have diet pills. Diet pills? It really works! You'll be surprised. Is that true? Is that pill a 'restricted one“? Yes, you know well, you can't buy them outside. I heard of it too. But are they really for diet? Yes, it works. Does it really? Does it make an ugly girl pretty? Yes, of course! Medicine please... What? The amusement park, yes, that... something like that. What is it? Something like... Give me the usual one. The one? It's okay. The next lot is in on 'Wednesday. I like the “bad people“ I hate those who pretend to be good. Good person... I have never seen one so I don't know! Hello, this is Kaneshiro. Oh, Hara, what's up? I was about to go to sleep. Hey, come, quickly. Hey! Wait a minute. Hurry, quick! Wait. Good evening! Hi. What is this? I have no idea. Yeah, me neither. Do something about this situation. Who are you'? Who are you'? I am his friend. Friend? Then you must be the same kind. Should I just stab you in the back? Excuse me, sorry to bother you. She is crazy! Why did she become like that? I just wanted to have sex and stay overnight. So, what I really want to tell you is that in this world, if anything bad happens. They all blame the situation on me. For example, because I was brought up by a single parent, I am such a pitiful person because... Never mind... Hey, bad boy! Long time no see! It's been two years already! Why are you idling away? Oh, sis! Sis! Don't point at me! What are you doing now? Huh? Come, follow me! Where to? Come on. What do you do nowadays? It's a secret! You are still being bullied? You are so selfish and self-centered, I am tired of it! Selfish and self-centered are the same thing. No matter how well you work, you are the worst kind! Disqualified as a human! You know nothing! Do you know how hard it is to get respect as a Korean in Japan? In this country, nothing but work will make people respect you! Nonsense! Don't you know? You are just a selfish bomb. If you like yourself so much, get married to yourself. Have sex with yourself, don't ask me! Children are mine! I gave birth! Daughter is with me. Then I have no choice. Have you had sex before? Sex? Whenever... No, no, I should be informed as a sister. Hey, what do you say? Sex! Sex! I have, of course. I have experience. Oh really? So young? So fast? I see. Maybe you are a sex maniac. Good to be young like you! How about you sis? Of course, many men, much sex! My pubic region looks funny! No, it's normal. It's big on the other side and if I slide it open, it looks strange. Not cute at all. Usually pubes are not cute. Sis, is mom doing well? She is fine! Getting younger every minute! Then it was the right thing to get divorced. Of course it was! Not having to see that worthless guy. Mom's wrinkles are getting lesser everyday! It's not fair, you guys are happy. I'll show you something nice. You always carry this around? Why not! I am happy to have so many friends! You want to say I am stupid, right? I won't say it but thinking... You shouldn't tease me! Hey, look! This picture! Doesn't it look good? I like this the most. Usually, I am not a photogenic person, but I look nice in this picture! And do you see her? She is my best friend! Don't you think she is beautiful? Not only beautiful but she has a good personality too. Yeah, my best friend. Stop it! Ouch! Sorry. Sorry, sorry! Oh, hi. Hey, hey, hurry up! Hey! Long time no see. Are you okay'? Yes, I am. What happened? In the morning I didn't see her in her room, so I went to the bathroom and there... Oh, I see. Nothing seemed to be wrong, everything was the same. I see. Hidenori, are you attending classes? Classes? Yes, I went yesterday Oh... really? How about university? University? Do whatever you feel like. Well, I should only have had one child! Then, should I die too? Excuse me customer, the company isn't doing well. And we don't appreciate shoplifters. Oh, “the just Korean“ guy! My heart... What are you doing? My heart is beating fast if you hold my hand in this way! If you were going to the police, be quick with it Can you stop using boys' slang? Shut up! You really want to go to the police station? You are the one who wants to bring me there! Try to guess. If you are thinking of having sex with me, dream on. Gosh, you read my mind or something? Second guess? I have nothing to be frightened of. Oh... strange, my throat is drying up. I think I need something to drink! None of my concern! You know, you are still a kid, a real kid! Yes, I think so too. Hey, I was thinking, I can't just leave empty-handed. Can I tell you something very straight forward? I am ready! I hate you. Sis, are you okay? How do you do? My name is Sasaki Yumi. Excuse me, this is mine but you can... This pajama, not sexy at all! Stop being picky! Gonna fall, be careful! By the way, is your wife okay? Yeah, guess so. What's up, Kaneshiro? Sorry to bother you. Oh, she's the one from the bowling alley, right? What is this? Who is this? My sister, but I guess she's a dead person. Oh yeah? Really? Yes, it's true. Did you kill her? Thanks for the help! You can go now. It's okay, start the car now. Why is she getting angry? You can go now, thank you! Let's go to the seaside. What? You want to dump her into the sea? You should bury her! Hey, driver! To Hakata please! Hakata? Yeah, I want to go too! Never been there! It is damn far away! You know that? You mean, I take you guys there? What are you doing, Kaneshiro? Got some alcohol tissue from the cafe, to not let her rot. Why did she die? Was she sick'? She committed suicide. Open up! Kaneshiro, are you going out with her? Going out? No, no, no! You should have chosen somewhere nearer! How do I put it, experiment, it is... Experiment? What experiment? I think my sister has a place she must go. Don't understand a word you say! Some place that people pay attention to her. What's that got to do with Hakata? She has never been to Korea. Me neither. Do you know the car-ferry? No. It goes from Shimonoseki to Pusan. How am I supposed to know! A long time ago it was the only route from Japan to Korea. I heard my grandfather used to use it a lot. Oh... Then we should be going there, not Hakata! There is a faster ferry in Hakata nowadays! Oh, is that so? I really don't understand you! I just want my sister to see what Korea is like! Dead people are not allowed on planes, right? Of course not! I think even on a ferry, they don't allow dead people! How come you can go out with such an idiot? No, I don't go out with him. He was such a coward, cry-baby from young! Every time he was bullied, he didn't have the guts to fight back! Worst case of all! I thought so. Are you a virgin? What? Whatever I am... Well, tell me. I should know this as an elder sister! Oh, is that so? Where are we going? Where are we? I have no idea. Your sister has a runny nose. Yuk! Really, sis, you are like a baby! Wow, beautiful! This is a very beautiful bridge! I'll wait for you here so be quick with it. Come back as soon as possible! Are you scared, Taru? No, I am not! We'll be back soon! Coward! Wow, Hakata is a nice city! Maybe you used to live here! Stop nagging! What should my sister wear? That one, yes that! You know the skirt that “Chosen“ high school students wear? The one that comes down from the chest, straight down. "Chimachogori"! Yes! That! Done! No way! You have to wear a brand thing if going to Korea. "Chogori"! Gucci! Hermes! Louise Vuitton! No, I said “chimachogori“! Gucci! Hermes! Louise Vuitton! I really don't understand you! I really don't understand you! Excuse me, are you asking for a fight? Excuse me, are you asking for a fight? I really don't understand you! I really don't understand you! Don't repeat what I say! Don't repeat what I say! You bastard! Hey, come over here, come! It looks good on me! It's not for you anyways. I know. What? I forgot to bring the money? Left it in the car? No, in Tokyo. Really looks good on me What are you going to do? It's expensive! Hum... no money? What's wrong? Your sister is going to be sad! Gosh, I look as if I have a super boobs! Yeah, exactly! Excuse me, customer... 1,2,3 Excuse me. Wait! Super-boobs cannot run anymore! Yes, you can! Not this way! Oh, never mind! Hey! Do you have a grandmother? Of course I have. Yeah, I guess so. I never saw my granny-in-law before. Did she pass away before you were born? No, she was alive until I was in junior high. Apparently, she was never out of Korea and I've never been to Korea. Didn't even attend her funeral You know my granny, she was one of a kind. I heard my mom was the eldest. Two girls up son and two girls down. And my grandfather was a bastard. He came to Japan and never went back to Korea. They were very poor. Very very poor. You could never imagine how poor they were. But she was a Christian. I think she could be strong because she had God. She sent all her children to school and even went to church every Sunday! She looked very strong. But it seems to work out but it isn't always the case. Mom's first sister, she got sick. Couldn't go to the hospital because they had no money. If they could have give her good medicine, she might have been fine. But they failed to do that, so she got worse day by day. At last, she died! When she died, at that very moment, my grandfather... He made a woman pregnant and had a son in Japan! You know what my grandma did? I don't know. It meant something if the boy was born in the family. So my grandma, her private place. Here, down below. She stitched it with needle and thread. So that she can never do it again with my grandfather. Do you think there is a God? Maybe. Well, as far as I know, he was the worst case! Hey! Do you have chewing gum or candy? This is the only money we have? All three of us combined together? What are we going to do? Let's sell the Gucci bag we stole! I think that spot is a good place for a prey. They are too big! They don't look strong! Should I go and work them out? Really? Why is she so into this? Wow, she took her jacket off? Wearing it again. She's going up! She is shaking her butt! Is she enjoying this? Aren't you enjoying, Taro? Hahaha, yeah I am enjoying it so much! Idiot! Not funny at all! It was such a hard time! What was? Your sister and l... She will thank you for being with her. I don't need it! I tell you, I don't like this situation. I am back! How was it? Perfect! What did you say? I said I came from Tokyo and ran out of money. So I came over to rob them. Oh, sometimes being frank is the answer to everything. No, that's not true! So, how much did you get? They said I am cute, so they gave 1000 yen each. Total 3000 Yen. That little? Well, but they told me about a good place to “earn money“. Where about, where? Where? Should we go? Take care of my sister! Okay, do your best. Even though I hold no hope. Wow, this place is good! I think we can “earn“ a lot of money here. Excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom. Ouch! I will be back soon! That couple looks rich! Well, they don't to me. Don't you think so? No, I said they don't look it. I am saying that couple has money! I said no! No! They are Korean. Let's go! Hello! Hey! Hello! This plate is from the city. Hey girl, are you from Tokyo? Don't be such a snub! It makes me sad. Is she sleeping? Let's go and have fun! Hey girl! Is the door locked? Yes, it is. Hey... Be careful...yeah Are you okay?... Yes I am. Are you? Ouch! Hey, wait! We are not bad people! Why doesn't it start! Oh gosh! Be careful! Be careful! She broke her leg! I think she definitely broke her leg. Broken? Yeah, broken. I see. Are you going to work early tomorrow? Tomorrow... Well... Sorry! We are here to rob you and this is the first time. Why, do you need a cigarette? I will call the police, go away! Oh, I think I like this girl! Me too! I like her too. Are you trying to do me? Yes we are! We will “do“ you! But we really don't have money, so we were looking for kind people that can give us money I will call the police! Wow, nice phone! This is a trendy one! Mine’s so rusty! Look! Rusty enough? Wow, cool! You want to scar her, do it! You bastard! If I make a scar on her face, you will look for another one You guys are crazy! Did you just realize now? Yes, we are crazy! How much do you want? As you want. Look! Rusty enough? What do you think you are doing? You can't treat money as if it's worthless! Such a bastard! You shouldn't be going out with him! Gave you money so buzz off! Hey, you can take the money but not my wallet! Give me back the wallet! How much does he have? Let's see. You are a professional! Huh? Oh... Taro, I am sorry My sister committed suicide and I don't care about anything anymore. And I am doing this kind of thing! I am such an idiot! Yes you are! Do you have any brothers and sisters? I don't know. How about you? I have a brother. You don't have to answer him so seriously! What if your brother dies? When they are dead, you miss them so much. If you don't go, I will go first! Ouch! It hurts! Ouch! Bye for now! Does it hurt? Of course it does! Did you do something again, Kaneshiro? Wow, you got me! What did you do? I stabbed him! No way! You did? Is he dead? No, no, not dead. Did you really stab him? Yes I did. You really are an idiot! Hey Taro, new model? I mean the car... A bit! Looks better than before, right? It's gonna cost me a lot! It's okay, doesn't look so bad, only a bit crashed! Oh really? Okay okay, only a bit... I think your sister urinated... What? Yes, Kaneshiro speaking. What? Yes, I did. How did it go? Can they take us? Really? Did you ask them for a favor? Oh, I see By the way, do they count in the dead body too? Yeah, I guess so. Send me the contact detail by SMS. Okay, thanks, bye! Where is Taro? I don't know, he went somewhere. Hey! Get out of the way. It's okay, I will do it. No way! You'll get tired! I said no! I'll do it. No! I will do it! No! I will do it! No! What are you doing? Don't look! What is it? How did it go? Well, things didn't turn out as I think they would. You know that with that ferry, we might have some way. That lady with the big parcel told me so. Well, I really don't think so. You talk to her already? So, what are you going to do? I already asked someone for help. So, you are going? The problem is the money! How much do you need? Minimum 2 million Yen, I heard 2 million Yen? Very expensive! I don't think it's possible, let's go back Let's do it big this time! Do it! Do it! Yeah! Do it! Idiot! I won't do it! Then, I will do it alone! No, no, no, it's impossible. Kaneshiro, let's stop here, alright? It's more than enough. You are getting weak inside, right? I tell you, listen up I really want to become happy! I'll be back soon. Where are you going? I can do it! I'll have this. 500 Yen, please. So expensive? It's cute, right? You'll lose your customers if it is so expensive. I don't think so. Either way, we might have reached the limit. It is amazing we made it up to here. Can they smuggle into Korea through Shimonoseki? Impossible! No way! There's no way they can do it. Do you think Kaneshiro was caught by now? He might not return. What are we going to do with her? She is starting to deteriorate. Smelly? A bit. I told you, we reached the limit. What is this sound? Phone, what do you think? Is that so? Hello... Please give me 2 million Yen. 2 million Yen please. Welcome! Excuse me, give me 2 million Yen please. 2 million Yen? Yes, 2 million Yen. You are here to pawn something, right? Pawn in... Oh, pawn... Can you take off your mask? No! I am shy. It's more shameful to ask for money like this. Borrowing money, I feel okay. But it's bit of a shame to ask someone for money. You really came here to ask for money? Why? Can I not? What is this? So, please give me 2 million Yen. You don't say you are a masked robber! Yes, maybe, yes, I am. I'll let you go this time so stop this right now. I need 2 million Yen. Telephone? Telephone... gonna call the police? Strange, why can't I get through? Huh? What is this? The line, telephone line. This is a cordless phone so it can be connected. No, you can't. You can be connected from here to here. But I cut the line so you cannot be connected. It's like stopping the main gas line. Useless! I'll help you put it back. Maybe it's better for you to give up by now. Why do you need so much money? I am running out of time? Running out of what time? Funeral. Whose'? My sister's. She's dead? I have to hurry because she is deteriorating. How about your parents? I don't have any. Government will do something for you then. I am not Japanese. What? Tears are running down from my eyes I can't help it. I long for you so much A man roaming around, longing for a woman A woman who doesn't wake up from dreaming The next station is Shimonoseki terminal. It will stop on the left side at No.7 platform. Thank you for using JR. Are these 2 million Yen in real money? Yeah, God! Real money! They are coming. Hey you! Hey, Kaneshiro! Kaneshiro! How is it? There is no one with this name. You idiot! I can hear you! I am Harada. Harada? Harada, Harada! Harada! Harada, Harada! Why are you here? What do you mean? Because I am worried! Just kidding. Wait a minute. She really wanted to come with me so... Hello, how are you? Hi. This is Taro. That is Sasaki Yumi. Hello. This is my friend, Harada. And she is his girlfriend. So, this car is the one? Yes, that's right. He is doing this as his part-time job. Excuse me, please turn your car to this side. Excuse me... Can you hear me? The car... Turn around... This side please. Okay, let's lift her. One, two, three! She is already very stiff. Deteriorating Kaneshiro. Yes, thank you for all this help. Do you have the money with you? Yes, I've got 2 million Yen ready. I really didn't want to do this, but considering your situation, I decided to help. Please help me. You better give me the money first. Can I give it to you later? What if something goes wrong? Okay then. But you have to at least show me the money. Thank you Then let's get going! You have your friends here so I'll be going. You are going back? Hey, I don't want to see you ever again! Oh, this is yours, I didn't wash it though. I don't expect anything like that from you. Kaneshiro, take care! Taro, you too! Don't die, okay? See you Taro! Hey, pay attention to your tone! So what! It's our fate if we can meet again! Bye. Bye. Do you think he can reach Tokyo with that car? I don't think so. Right? Gosh, I forgot! I need to help her put on make up. Did you steal these again? I borrowed it! You have no manners! Can I help you too? I have eye shadows etc too. Really? What color do you have? Rose red. Good. Hey stop it! I wanna puke, stop touching! Shut up and follow me. No, stop it. What is it? How did you get it? It's a present for you! Don't you think it's marvelous? You are one of a kind! You think so too? Can I shoot? No, don't shoot! It's dangerous! It's for emergency use. I said don't shoot! Use it when you are in trouble! You have it for now. Hide it! Is the shipyard far from here? It takes about an hour from here. Let me see. Look! Rosy enough? Good Right? We have to match with lipstick color too. I'll put the eye shadow first then. Yes, please. Let's do it! Can this ship reach Korea? Korea is just right over there. You can even reach there by swimming if you want to. Yeah, we can go by swimming too! Yes, that's right. Kaneshiro, check this out! This is a present from me. She is an university student. Don't you think you made her too young? She looks fine, right? Looks perfect! A lot of guys will be after her when she reaches Korea. I am ready here! How are you going back to Tokyo? We can manage it. You should be worried for yourself! Kaneshiro! Do you think we can meet again? I have no idea! You bastard! So long! Police? It's the police! Ah! That's Taro over there. He is back! The ending should be this way! This is for your happiness! Happiness! Are you Kaneshiro Hidenori? We need to investigate on two robbery cases. Can you come with us for a while? I am busy right now. What do you think you are saying? We even have warrant with us! Again? It doesn't scare me at all. Come on, get moving! What are you doing? It's dangerous! Kaneshiro, you're really kaput! Nice guy! I am not kaput, but I wanna be though! Stop this and go with us. You guys are scared! No way! Your punishment will be heavier if you don't stop. After the warrant, then what? Put me into prison? Enough! Stop it and come over here. You guys are scared! Enough! Stop this right now! Bang! Well, do you think I scared them? Why do you have to shoot? He didn't shoot at you! Just before, he... No, he didn't shoot! About my son. They said they won't sue him. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Enjoy your drink! Sorry to trouble you with this incident. No, not at all. I like him. I have to leave now. I need to go and see a doctor. Please, this is the bill. Thank you for your drink. Well, this is about it! Basically Gosh, I totally forgot about it! The pictures I took! What should I do with them? The pictures? Ouch! Well, I think this is about it. This time, he did try his best. Yeah. Of course, he still is an idiot. Yes, he's an idiot but... But what? What is it? What is it? Hey what is it? What is it? Why are you laughing? I haven't died yet. Of course I haven’t died yet. Are you hurt?
