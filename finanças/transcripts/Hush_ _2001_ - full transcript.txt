Kind of sudden You seem like you'd have unusual taste Oh, yeah Someone boyish, maybe Whatever Floor's wet there My left leg's just a little shorter than my right So I can't wear pumps with heels If I do, I have to shave down one heel or add inserts and I just look ridiculous That's why I always wear these cheap, tacky flats - Shoes? - Shoes Shoes are made to be worn Huh But you know those women who seem to be so fearless When I see a woman like that, I can't help feeling I'm worthless But that's not true Really? I mean... That makes me happy I really wanted you to know Oh, right I have to make a call Oh, no! I'm so sorry It's fine I'm really sorry It's nice to have a meal like this, just two women I don't have many women friends Not surprising What? So? What do you want? Oh, I'm sorry Here we've only just met and I invite you out But I don't have anyone else to talk to I'm just terribly confused about what to do When I met you today, I knew you'd be fine Like I could trust you A sixth sense I have that about people You recruiting? I have a handicap So how someone sees me is very important Are they condescending, are they respectful I have to be especially careful choosing people I'm in love with someone With someone who accepts me just the way I am Listen... But I'm anxious He can be timid, you know And even if he cares about me, if someone aggressively seduces him, he might just be tempted And I really couldn't bear that... I don't know who you're talking about so I really don't know... I'm talking about Katsuhiro Don't be so thick What! We're getting married Huh? Hospitalization Form Wow, so this is where you work Oh... I'll come over there Kind of like a monster movie set Yeah The umbrella Thanks for the new one Well, I broke the other one I'm sorry to bother you at work Had to talk to you About what? But first I need to know something That woman, Nagata san, who works here Are you going to marry her? Huh! No, I am not She's just someone I work with That's what I thought What is this? That's exactly what I thought One more thing Your lover is that man you were with at the noodle shop, right? Am I wrong? Is it that... I'm sorry, I don't really know that much about gay people No, it's OK Is it a secret? No... Is it that obvious to strangers? It's just I've tried to live my life very carefully I'm sorry if I've offended you Somehow... I always manage, to fudge things... Any more questions? No, that's all Listen, I don't like beating around the bush, so I'll just say it I want a baby Hello? Not to marry you or go out with you or anything I just... want a child Kind of sudden, isn't it? It's just... Your eyes When I saw your eyes Eyes? I thought you have a father's eyes You say, a father's eyes, but... I mean, I wouldn't be a burden or anything, I know you have a lover... Don't look so troubled But it's a child, after all Besides, these days there are lots of ways to do it without sex That's not the... What do you say? A child... But... Hold me tight! Hold me, hold me Hey, are you OK? Listen, think it over, OK? Just 3 minutes of exercise a day can result in well-toned, sexy abdominals Abs, huh... Great... Listen, listen, you know those ab machines they have at the gym How much you think they cost? Use 'em at the gym But do you think they're expensive? Huh? So go to the gym No, I'm asking if they're expensive Do you or don't you know? I don't know Then just tell me I was just asking you You're mad I'm not You always eat ice cream when you're mad Says who? I was distracted, I'm sorry Forget it What? It's just today... Yeah? Someone said I have a father's eyes What? Who? The woman I loaned the umbrella to What's that about? Why'd you see her? She came to give it back You know, I lost my dad when I was little So I've never really had a father image I never imagined myself as one Of course not You're gay I know, but... You love men, right? I always figured it was out of the question What is? What? You know, having a family or whatever I mean, in our world, relationships rarely last You have to be prepared to go it alone You're so tough No I'm not I'm sorry I'm with you... because I don't like being alone Yeah, sorry It's OK I can't breathe... Beats being Ionely Yup... I'll go tell her Tell her what? She asked me to make a baby The thing is, I over-plucked my eyebrows Think they'll grow back? Sure You really think I bet it'll take at least 2 or 3 weeks You really think they're OK? You were moaning, Fujikura san Yeah, it still hurts a little Of course it does You got chopped up inside Thing is, I over-plucked them Think they'll be OK? Fujikura, Fujikura I don't see it Are you sure it's this ward? Just that she's in Gynecology I see I wonder I see Oh, I've got her, thanks Katsuhiro? Oh, no I can't believe how hard this place is to find I kept going in circles It is so awfully hot You keep a clean toilet Why did you come here? I told you not to How else can I see you?

You'll get breasts, like this, right? No I will not You've always been like that Never known how to open up What a shock! Why are you crying? You do as you please for now Once you're older, you'll see Finally, it comes down to blood About family, relatives Everyone else is a stranger, even that man there Don't say "that man" What will a stranger ever do for you What's going to happen to you!

I first met him a long time ago We work together We started dating recently Oh, the same job He didn't tell me It must be really rough on your hands But I really wonder about all that It's fine to be affectionate But the ones who dress them in little wool outfits I think a natural coat's the best Excuse me, what are you talking about? What? What? Do you like tofu? One-pot tofu, silken Yes Oh, good It's no fun eating one-pot alone When it's hot out, best to eat hot food and sweat it all out They're out of lemon soy sauce Oh, no And gently tighten And once more And tighten, gently, like you're trying not to pee Nice and tight now Close the birth canal And open it And once more OK, now for a new exercise Your hands on the base of your breasts And be careful not to touch your nipples That could put you into labor OK, now the other side Gently push Just what is this? Aerobics That's not what I mean I've been researching into giving birth No, how long has this been going on? What's been going on? I thought he turned you down, that nonsense about having a kid But I decided not to give up Thought I'd persuade him The worst What's he doing behind my back? Hey, could you help me? What? He's always evading me If I raise a baby with him, we should share child-rearing Which means you'll be involved since you live with him It'd be best if you two... Really, won't you talk to him about it? You really are crazy Hear that all the time Used to, that is Can't you take it somewhere else? There's got to be lots of men There are sperm banks Couldn't you just leave us alone? We finally... Don't get me wrong I have no intention of coming between you two What do you want then?
