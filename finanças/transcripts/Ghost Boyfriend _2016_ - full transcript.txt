Do people have next life? I always think if I can realize that eternal wish. If there comes a day. When we can embrace in the sunshine. Maybe then... Once can live his life... With no more regrets. Even if there are more difficulties. Even across time and space even across life and death. Nothing can stop me from loving you. Don't worry! I believe there must be countless questions in your heart. Such as who I am, where I'm from where am I going, and so on. But I'm sure that I can offer you the most comfortable service. With the most sincere attitude to ensure that you feel at home. First of all, please turn your neck and move your arms. Yes, that's right. Do you feel pain in your limbs, weakness in your whole body and pain in your head? Don't worry, this is all normal. When you're dead, it's like sleeping for a long time. Everyone feels sore after sleeping for too long, don't you think? Secondly, do you feel confused? No worries, it's all normal. When you're dead, it's like sleeping for a long time. Everyone feels sore after sleeping for too long, don't you think? I'm dead? Yes, honey. You have a good understanding. Honey, don't ask us who we are. Also, don't ask me who I am. And you don't have to ask who he is. You can go anywhere now. For example, fulfilling your wish before you die. Or you can scare the classmates who usually grab your snacks. You can also sleeping with your upper-bunk bros for fun. When the last snow of this winter falls, We will take you away from this world. Leave? What if I don't want to leave? Your body will slowly disappear. At last, in the end, there will be no trace of your existence in the world. And no one who has anything to do with you will ever remember you again. So, you don't exist in this world anymore. You're not who you were. The former you is the present you. But You're not who you were. What I'm saying is probably confusing to you, Have you read Hawking's "A Brief History of Time"? You always say next time. Why are you being all sissy Whenever I ask youout? Come on. I really don't have time tomorrow. Next time , Next... Yexiaoou , Hello? - Say something. - I've got to go. I need to save my life, bye. I'll sort it out right away. You said you won't be back in three days. Why come back so early? Luqiming , Are you ok? I'm fine. I'm going to sleep. That's odd. Lu Qiming the super clean freak should have lost his temper seeing me like this... Why is it so quiet today? The memory seems to disappear completely. I don't know if I am a human or a ghost, Where did I come from, where to go. The manuscript seems to be a midnight psychic medium, Bringing me to Yexiaoou's side. Yo~. Everything looks just as normal today. Are you running a fever? Luqiming, you demanding capitalist... why are you making breakfast for me? I didn't say I was making breakfast for you. I knew it. I knew you're not so kind, It's good enough you're not bullying me. Emm, Luqiming. You don't feel normal today. Don't scare me. I'm flattered. Have Breakfast first. Will I die after breakfast? Have a glass of milk. You didn't poison it, did you? You're not trying and kill me, are you? I got it. Are you trying to destroy all the evidence that you bullied me before? What are you thinking with that little head of yours? I'm happy, so I want to be nice to you. What's wrong? You don't want it? Why are you starting at me? You look better today. Luqiming. Why are you smiling so weird today? Xiaoou, starting from today, Can we get along peacefully? Did I hear that right? What are you planning exactly? I'm serious. Then write me a bond and sign it. No problem at all. And you have to swear. Do I have to swear? Are you serious or not? Okay, I'll swear. I, Luqiming I promise not to bully Yexiaoou, No prank. Not to disturb his work. If I fail doing so, I will... Never have a wife your whole life. Fine, never have a wife my whole life. He promised so easily. Is it a trap? What if he gets a husband? Luqiming, you are so twisted. What? I think he likes you. Baiyiting, Can you be serious? Nothing happened between us. All right. I'm worried about you. I'm telling you, Beautiful women are no longer a threat, handsome men are. My husband is too pretty. So I have to be careful. Even if he likes me, I can't fancy him, He's too annoying. He used to bully me in the dormitory. And after we shared the apartment together, he still bullies me. He's acting so freaky suddenly. Did he get provoked or something? When I see him now, I shiver. How does he usually bully you? All is planned by destiny. A long long time ago... Get straight to the point. He's my senior, but insisted on sleeping in our dorm room. He didn't want to sleep on his own bed but keeps sleeping in mine with me. And he threw away all the presents I get from girls who likes me in a rubbish bin. In my view, he's full of emptiness. So, he is jealous of me being happier than him. That's why he hates every single thing that I liked. He's against me on everything. I think the amount of information is huge. Tingting is right. There is a lot of information. You two are too twisted. You are shy. I'm a hag so I see the cuteness. Don't you think I'm so adorable? Go die right away, please. Luqiming... What are you doing? Yexiaoou, what do you wanna do? I have a contract, dare you break the contract? I have nothing to lose. With this attitude of yours, you wont be able to get a wife! I don't mind, bullying you... is more interesting than marrying a wife. You're nuts. Listen, don't ever litter again. Luqiming, you said you won't bully me anymore. You broke your promise! Broke my promise? Yexiaoou , are you silly? I wouldn't be Luqiming if I keep my promise. Alright then, don't give me puppy eyes. I won't bully you anymore. Then let's shake hands as a deal, and get along peacefully! Luqiming, what's with your attitude? Remember to do the dishes. My manuscript is not finished yet Luqiming! I'm not doing the dishes! Have you done the dishes? Of course... not yet. Didn't you say you want to work on the manuscript? Then I'll have to experience life for inspirations, isn't? Lame excuses. Better than you not keeping your promises. Turn off the TV. I don't wanna! Turn it off! Alright then, play poker with me? Paste 10 notes on your face. You lose once, tear one. Tear until theres nothing left. Loser do the dishes. And winner getes to watch TV. Count me out. You're afraid of losing. You're definitely losing! Just you wait, go and wash the dishes! Get me a good one... Luqiming, you're so going to lose. You lost again... You lose! Quick, throw in the towel. What are you doing? You! Whatever! I'll wash the dishes. With poison. Sorry! I'm very sorry. It's alright. Yexiaoou. Yes. I'm very sorry for what happened, I'm Wenyuyang. It's fine. Mr. Ye, are you a novelist? Yes, why? I am the project manager of Lu's Films. I just read your script, and I think it's pretty good. Secretary Luo, get my business card. I am very interested in your novel. If you are interested in film adaptation, feel free to contact me at any time. Ok, I look forward to the opportunity to cooperate, goodbye. Yexiaoou, novelist? That should be him. Secretary Luo, help me look up this person. Ok. You're back! What's the matter? My reputation. Who broke your heart? My script was trampled by someone who doesn't understand it. Forget it, I don't wanna talk about it. Then don't. I used to be a famous novelist on the Internet before. But now... Why are you laughing? A girl gets surrounded by several bad guys. Then a tall and handsome boy appeared. Just like a prince straight from fairy tales. What the heck, "Bodyguard of School Babe"? The boy saved the girl. The girl wants to repay him. But the boy demands her to be his girlfriend. This is literally "Overbearing President Loves Me". Luqiming, I'm warning you. You can insult my personality, you can even insult my body. But you can't insult my work. Ok, Let me think. Am I insulting your personality first? Or insult your body first. Luqiming, stop it, I'm so annoyed. Since I graduated, I couldn't find a decent job. Although we share the apartment together. But basically I'm a freeloader. Now, even my novel has been rejected. I feel like you're my sugar daddy now. My sad life! Yexiaoou, stop! Yexiaoou. Can you lend me some money? No. I am indignant and worried, I can only be relieved by drinking. Sir, I have a story, do you have wine? Fine, I'll listen to your story. I have wine, wait a minute. Xiaoou, what do you think this is? What? Look closer. Luqiming, I knew you wanted to do bad things. You never change, and you keep bullying me. Come here, let me see. Don't pretend. Don't move, I'll blow it for you. Don't touch me! Come on. Why did you kiss me? Yexiaoou, what are you thinking? Why are your thoughts so evil? Me? Evil? You crossed the line. I am a guy. What's wrong with that? I am also a guy. Cheers for us guys. Here, cheers. Do it yourself. You worked hard last night. Dig in. Don't make such an erotic breakfast in the future. I don't want to eat at all. What's wrong with this breakfast, it's very nutritious. What were you thinking? Luqiming, you bastard, last night... What did I do last night? Hey, don't you complain. I was tired last night. Stop it, I have proof. Don't think that I drink too much, you can cheat me, you see. How about it? Are you afraid of seeing the evidence? Do you know you're committing a crime? Xiaoou, you have nothing on your neck. Impossible. No, it's still there in the morning. Xiaoou. Are you dreaming? Tell me, what did you dream of last night. Tell me. I dreamed about you being nasty, shameless, asshole, mean. Oh I see. You dream of me being despicable and shameless to you, right? Yes. What you think in the day will appear in your dreams at night. Yexiaoou, are you fancying me every day? Never. Last night, you had too much wine. You're vomiting and noisy all night. I was busy taking care of you. That's why I said I'm tired. You were also tired. What are you thinking about? I'm done eating. Man, you're in a complicated situation. Oops, don't talk nonsense. Your girls are more experienced. Help me analyze. You see, Luqiming's every move is very abnormal. Maybe he's really into you. Impossible, he still bullied me as before. Then you're into him. It's even more impossible, I'm sick of him. So how do you explain the dream you had? Eh... dreams don't mean anything. What you think in the day will appear in your dreams at night. Just like me, dreaming of my WenJing every day, right, WenJing? Leave me out of your chaos. I think that's just a nightmare because I had too much wine. How could I like him, this is impossible. I am a guy, he is also a guy. I don't hate it though. But I cannot accept it. You're making a mess all over your face. It's 21th century now, okay? Are you time-travelling from primitive society? Well, being an experienced BL lover, I can go to your place and take a look before making a conclusion. Ha, then he should be angry. Since you care so much about his feelings, Then there is no way, I will not go. Who cares how he feels, come. But I live in his house after all. I still need to report to him. When you marry him in the future, he will be the one controlling you. Who said I will marry him? Xiaoou, what's for dinner tonight? Whatever. Btw, my girlfriend may stop by. What? Your girlfriend? Who are you looking for? I am looking for Yexiaoou. Yiting, here you are! Xiaoou. Let me introduce, This is my university senior and roommate, Luqiming. She is... I am Yexiaoou's girlfriend. My name is Baiyiting. White is the white snake BaiSuzhen's white. Yi is beauty luyiping's yi "LuYiping is a beauty in a TV series". Ting is guo bi ting's ting "GuoBiting is a very beautiful female star". Nice to meet you. Please, come in and sit. Luqiming, go and pour a glass of water for Yiting. It doesn't matter, I'm not thirsty. Mr. Lu, come sit down, don't be restrained. Make yourself at home. Sorry, this is your home. Why did you sit down? Didn't you hear what Miss Bai said? She is not thirsty. Sorry. It doesn't matter, what does Mr. Lu do? I'm unemployed. Oh, it doesn't matter, Mr. Lu is still young and talented. There will definitely be great success in the future. Can I call you Qiming? Qiming, you are so handsome, you must have a girlfriend, right? No, but... I already have someone in my heart. Why are you guys looking at me? Nothing, my aunt has a daughter. I was going to introduce her to Qiming. I did not see that coming. But it makes sense, since Qiming is a great catch, right? Does your aunt have a daughter? She just give birth to one! Do not bother me. Eh... It's not early. - It's not early, Miss Bai should go home. - It's not too early, Yiting stays for dinner. Your hospitality is hard to resist. Then I will... stay. Ok, Luqiming, I'm hungry now. Go cook. Yexiaoou, what are you talking about? Yexiaoou, listen. If you're hungry, make your own meal. I am not responsible for serving you, and your girlfriend. I have almost figured out everything. Life is important, if you are still alive. I will contact you later, gotta go, bye. Hey, explain it to me. Oh my God, Yexiaoou, don't you have a brain? I can see what's going on, you still don't understand. If you can survive tonight, let's not contact each other anymore. I hope you won't mind. Take care, bro, goodbye. No... What is she talking about? Luqiming, what's the matter with you? Luqiming, talk to me, are you ok? Luqiming I'm hungry, go cook. Forget it, you don't want to cook, I don't want to eat it either. Your cooking is terrible I don't like it! I'm not going to eat it! What's the big deal? Without you, will Yexiaoou not be able to live? My cooking is terrible? Go ask your girlfriend to cook for you. I wouldn't bother! Don't you eat anything I'm making tonight. Fine by me! Who's afraid of who? You freak! Why did you suddenly appear, I didn't eat anything. Alright, stupid are you really angry with me? I knew you would be hungry. I warmed you a glass of milk. Not having dinner is bad for your stomach, drink some milk. Thank you. I said a lot of bad things today. Actually you are nice. But I just don't understand. Why are you doing this today. Nothing, I'm in a bad mood today. I was thinking about my dad. I didn't mean to target you. Your father? My dad passed away some time ago. I have nothing now. My stepmother and her son got all my dad's legacy. They froze my bank card. I have no place to go. That's why I came back here. So now you know why I came back early. No relatives was willing to see me. I never felt I'm home unless I'm back here. Your stepmother and his son are too bad. Luqiming, don't be sad. You have me, God is watching everything people do, I must... Although I can't help you get even for you. However, you have to believe the law. I gave everything to them. Don't worry, I still have a little savings here. Don't worry, you're safe here. Worst case, you can depend on me. Forget it, it's hard for you to depend on yourself. Luqiming, why are you so annoying? You keep mocking me. I know I'm not very rich but I can at least provide you food. Although I can't afford a famous brand, I can keep you warm. Although I can't take you to a very expensive meal, I can afford three meals a day. Why do you look down on people so much? Xiaoou, Thank you. I am very touched by what you say. However, if you get married in the future. I can't stay by your side. You're thinking too much. Although you always bully me, but you're also my best friend. Even if I am married, I will still care about you. So we're just friends? Eh... Anyway, as long as I can be with you. I'm happy. Nothing else matters. That's right, don't be emotional, relax yourself. Yexiaoou, Since I first met you. I feel that you live happily every day. I like your smile. Actually, as long as you learn to leave everything alone, just let it go. You will find that the world is suddenly bright. As long as there is hope, my mother told me the sun is always behind the storm. Yexiaoou, I really envy you. Btw, Yiting... Baiyiting? Although she is a bit sensitive and not normal but she's nice. Do you love her? I don't think it's love. My mother's neighbor, her aunt, introduced us to know each other. Actually, when I just graduated from college, I didn't plan to be in a relationship. However, my mother is very anxious. And when we met, she said, I am just her type. And I don't hate her. So we got together. Yexiaoou. Do you know how it feels to love someone? Why ask me this? Since you don't love her, are you happy? It's not about happy or unhappy. Anyway, life so far is pretty good, Just live happily. Don't think about those messy things. After so many years, you still haven't changed. I just don't want to make things complicated. Live at the moment and live every day to the fullest. Cherish those happy days. So there will be no regrets in the future. Thanks for your warm milk, treat me better in the future. I need to go to work. But it's late. Of course. Great writers like us who will be remembered forever, Always stay up late. Okay, then rest early after work. Hey. Didn't I tell you? Don't contact me unless it's urgent. Baiyiting, cut it out. I know what's going on. Luqiming was missed his father yesterday. That's why he's a bit sentimental. Oh my God, are you out of your mind? That's not even an excuse. I'm furious. I feel sad for Qiming. Then tell me, why is he angry? Come over to my place again? No, no, I dare not go to your house again. That guy's jealousy is overwhelming. Okay, I still have things to do here, so I gotta go. Don't contact me if there's anything urgent. If you are fine, also don't contact me, Got it? Bye bye. Baiyiting, Baiyiting, hello, hello. Hello, is it Mr. Wen? This is Yexiaoou, okay. Why are you sleeping here? Eh, I... are you hungry? I'll cook breakfast for you. No need, I'm going out, you can sleep a little longer! Don't leave your stomach empty in the morning. It's okay, I'll just buy breakfast on the way. I have an appointment with someone today... ... to discuss the film and television adaptation of the novel. If things goes well, I have money to feed you, bye. Xiaoou, wait a minute, come here... what? - Don't move. - You are really wasting money, Return it! No, no refund, put this on. I just want to be nice to you. If you don't put it on, I will stop you from going out. Fine, I'll put it on. Come back early. Why? Don't ask so much. Come back early when work is over. Ok. Did the guests who made an appointment at ten o'clock come? Already waiting in the lounge. Give me the document and send him in. Ok. Have a seat. Thank you. Mr. Ye, I went through your outline. To be frank, This outline is not what I want. Our project is a romance movie, But the plot is too straightforward to support a big production. Do you understand? What do you think? I won't use this outline. Please write a new one. Okay, about the contract... Mr. Ye, I hope you can write a new outline. But I can't sign a contract with you yet, sorry. I understand, thank you. I should get going. I will go back and modify it. It doesn't matter, Mr. Ye. We can also discuss in detail. Mr. Wen, about the adaptation of the novel. I think I understand what you want. I will modify it accordingly. Don't call me Mr. Wen. You are about my age, call me Yuyang. I won't call you Mr. Ye anymore. Let's be friends. Wen... yuyang. What's wrong, is there any difficulty for Xiaoou? No big deal. It's just that I have a dog and it takes a lot of money. I hope we can really work together. I see, so be it. Later, I can pay your deposit in my personal name. Just give me your card number. No, Mr. Wen, I don't mean that. This is the first time I have received such an acknowledgement I hope to make money through my own efforts. So I can raise my dog. In fact, I'm also new to all these things about this project. It's a bit overwhelming. All beginnings are hard. This is the first time I got such a case. I can understand how you feel. This project is very important to me. Xiaoou, you must bring me a great story. I hope we have a great time working together. Rest assured, I will do my best to accomplish this. We can always discuss. Xiaoou, about your story outline, The overall writing is still in line with my thoughts. But the problem is the ending. I prefer to have the story end a tragedy. Why should it end in tragedy? I think for someone who doesn't love themselves. Why would he wish others happiness? Love is selfish. If you can't get it, destroy it. It's also a good story. But I think, loving someone doesn't always mean owning them. Okay, let's not talk about work. We have been chatting for so long. For work, we need to communicate more in the future. This is my first project after taking over the company. Xiaoou, you must help me get it right. Of course. Thank you Xiaoou. I should thank you for your trust. Xiaoou, your ring is so beautiful. It's not mine. So... My friend gave it to me. Girlfriend? No, a male friend, what's wrong? Nothing. This ring is very special, I think it's custom-made. Mr. Wen, is this expensive? The price is not low, But I think the price is not the point. The point is that what your friend wants to express is very meaningful. He's a weirdo, I don't now what he has to express. Wow, it's already late. Let's get something to eat together. We still have a lot of details to talk about. But, I... Don't you have a dog to take care of? Let's get to know each other more. We can also seize the time to finalize the story. Okay then. I am back. Where have you been? I went out to talk about business. Do you also need to socialize? Do you know how long I've been waiting for you? Why don't I need to socialize? If you are hungry, you can eat first. Yexiaoou, do you have a heart? Hey... Mr. Lu. Why are you scolding me as soon as I come back? Moreover, Who are you? Whether I come back or not, what does it have to do with you. Didn't I tell you to come home early? What time it is now? Luqiming, why are you so strict? You know what I was working for! You... Who knows who you are hanging out with. Luqiming, I'm warning you! Don't always be so arrogant. Don't ever think you could get everything done alone. Don't ever think work would be done by itself. There are many things that you can't accomplish on your own. Do you think it's easy to make money? Beside... I can't afford such a valuable thing, take it back. Hello, President Wen, hello. Okay, okay, please come over. Okay, I will send you the address, See you later. Who is it? Who do you think you are? None of your business. Manager Wen who is in charge of our project, Wenyuyang. He's coming over to discuss the plot and contract with me. Wenyuyang? How did you know this person? I don't welcome him. Does it have anything to do with you? Don't talk to me, get away... When President Wen comes. You stay in the room. Don't mess things up, got it? Yexiaoou, are you familiar with this person? Why are you letting him come to our house? Does it have anything to do with you? You idiot! I... Your home is easy to find. Is it ok? Mr. Wen, have a seat. Mr. Wen, take a look, I slightly modified the outline of the story, What do you think? Xiaoou, it's interesting here, Mr. Wen, please have some water. Here, I think... President Wen... Didn't I tell you to stay in your own bedroom? Why did you come out? This is my roommate, Luqiming. Hello Mr. Lu. Luqiming, what are you doing? Keep going, don't worry about me. Are you doing this on purpose? Xiaoou, I have something to do today, Let's discuss some other time. Mr. Wen, we decide not to sell the adaptation right of this novel. Please stay away from Yexiaoou. Luqiming, you can't decide for me! Because I am your roommate. I'm leaving now, I still have something to do. The contract... Let's talk about the contract again someday. Let me see Mr. Wen out. Don't add trouble. That's okay. Luqiming, you are really here! Wenyuyang, why are you close to Xiaoou... Please stay away from him. Of course I am doing this for you. However, it's all because of fate, Yexiaoou and I only met by accident. Wen Yuyang, what on earth are you planning to do? Luqiming, you are really lucky to have escaped from death. What do you mean? Don't you remember? The driver who caused the accident was you. Yes, it's me. I don't want anyone to get anything I can't get! As for Yexiaoou... I warn you, Yexiaoou is mine. No one can touch him except me. If you dare to hurt Yexiaoou, I will make you very painful. You have made me very painful. Wenyuyang, I used to treat you well. How I wish you didn't treat me so well. You gave me hope and destroyed it. I thought as long as I was strong enough, I could have you. But I was wrong. Even if I get everything, I won't get you. Is it so hard for you to love me? You are too paranoid. Let's sort things out between you and me, Don't involve Xiaoou. Things between you and me can't be solved. Even if Yexiaoou is gone, We can't solve it, can we? I have given you all I could. You shouldn't be greedy anymore. Luqiming, do you think I like those things? You know exactly what I want, Sorry, I can't give you that. Fine, then there is negotiation. Luqiming, I just want you to know that I'm already out of my mind. I don't care about anything, goodbye. Luqiming, what did you mean? What? What were you doing? I don't like him, I don't welcome him. I will not allow him to approach you. You don't like Baiyiting, you don't like Mr. Wen. Is there anyone you like in this world? I like Luqiming. Now I know why your stepmother would drive you out of your house. Because you are a person who is selfish and dictatorial. Have you ever liked anyone? Have you considered the feelings of others? You're just a spoiled little brat. Who do you expect to like you? Spoiled? Yexiaoou, am I such a person in your heart? Am I wrong? - Yexiaoou, I like... - What do you like? Like to tease people? Or you like to control others according to your own wishes? Or you like to give people puppy eyes? Anyway, I don't welcome him in our house. He is not a good person. Are you a good person? Do you really know what I work so hard for? You got kicked out and your bank card was locked. Everything I do is to make money. So that we could live a better life. Have you thought about my feelings? All you do is yelling at me when I get home late. You are really selfish. Xiaoou. I'm doing everything for you. Luqiming, you really can lose your temper in anything. And you're always justifying that. You are really the most selfish person I have ever seen in my life. Yexiaoou, Love is always selfish. I don't want to share you with others, even a little bit, do you understand? And I will never let anyone hurt you, even a little bit. Yexiaoou, I love you. Love me? This joke is not funny at all. Yexiaoou. Yexiaoou. Xiaohei, Xiaohei, hurry up. Treating guests so coldly is not good. We said to make them feel at home and to provide sincere service. Customer is God. Although we don't believe in God. But we should understand the spirit. Customer needs are our biggest motivation. Customer satisfaction is our greatest pursuit. Xiaohei, with your attitude, how would the customers be satisfied? It's when the customer needs us most. However, if the customer asks you to do something over the line I will not agree. If it really happens, I will also replace you to meet the unsatisfied requirements of customers. Shut up. Xiaohei, are you jealous? Rest assured, I will take good care of my virginity for you. After all, I only have you in my heart. Xiaohei, don't worry. I'm not the kind of man who likes many people. You see, actually you still care about me in your heart. Right? Move it! Go entertain your customers. Xiaohei, be gentle with me! Wenyuyang came over. I'm afraid he might hurt Xiaoou. I understand your feeling. After all, if anyone hurts my Xiaohei. I would be very angry. Have you been touched by me, dear. He's ignoring me again. But you have to remember. Never do anything that violates normal order. Otherwise, the consequences are serious. You have to believe the laws on your side. Heaven's vengeance is slow but sure. Relevant departments will do you justice. I got it, rest assured. How much time do I have left? Not much. Can I stay with Yexiaoou forever? No. Why not? Xiaohei, this is your fault. People who love each other should be brave to express it. Whether he is human or ghost, male or female, top or bottom. Not confessing your love leaves a life-long regret. You might never have the chance. If it's okay, let's go first. I haven't finished speaking. Go home and you can say as much as you like, I don't want others to see you being such an idiot. Xiao Hei, you don't love me anymore? You are so cold to me, I'm sad. And you're staring me with that deadly look of yours. You just don't love me anymore. I have less and less communication with customers recently. Do you know how much useful information I get every time? Let me finish my words. You can finish it slowly when we're home. I haven't finished speaking yet. Xiaohei, are you jealous of my intimacy with the customers? I am close to customers for business only. Why do you think we got that five-star reviews last month? You're ignorant every time we're out on a mission. You're so cold to me, Even on our way back home. Okay, shut up. Xiaohei, do you like me? I just want you to shut up. Xiaohei, do you like me? I just want you to shut up. Xiaohei, do you like me? You are annoying. And you're denying! Say it, say you like me. No. You like me. No. Be gentle. It hurts. Xiaohei. Quiet. - Heihei. - Shut up! Hei... Shut up! Sorry, my jealousy is too strong. I care too much about you. I don't like to see you with others. I'm afraid you will be hurt. I know you are doing all this for my own good. But today... is my fault. But I had to do this. Please forgive me! Turn on the light. Why did you turn off the light? Turn on the light. Luqiming, why are you in my room? I came to turn off the light for you. None of your business. Yexiaoou, are you afraid of darkness? I am afraid of darkness? You're kidding. I am afraid of darkness? I think you are afraid of darkness. Then turn off the light. This is my room, I can decide for myself. I can turn it off or not turn it off. Fine, so you are really afraid of darkness. You... Luqiming, why are you so annoying, get out! Close the door and go back to your own room, don't disturb my sweet dreams. I will turn it off, good night! I refuse to talk to you. Whoever speaks first loses. Go away. Don't go. What happened? The light in my room seems to be broken. Can I sleep in your room? No, or should we sleep together? Luqiming, I wanna ask you something. Spit it. Tell me, how did you manage to be so shameless? Every time you quarreled with me, you would try everything to pamper me. I didn't pamper you. And you're still denying. Also, how did you make shameless so extreme. Yexiaoou, if you say one more word. Believe it or not, I will Possess you tonight. No... let's sleep. Are you going to sleep like this all night? Am I so scary? Don't turn off the light. The lamp is beautiful, right? Right? Is it beautiful? Oh yes, you are afraid of darkness. I'm afraid of darkness, is there a problem? I can't sleep with the light off. Well, you are still afraid of darkness. What is this? Luqiming, what are you doing? A man of your age is afraid of darkness. You do not understand. I often have a dream, so... You are a coward. Luqiming, I warn you. No personal attacks. If a ghost is sleeping next to you, Are you scared? Oops, go... However, to tell you the truth, I often dream of a car accident. The man in the dream, I can't see his appearance. I only saw him squished. Very scary. So I dare not turn off the lights. As long as it is evening, that scene will appear in my mind. With me here, don't be afraid, go to sleep. Luqiming, I don't know how I feel about you. So, I avoided your feelings for me. I only know that I cannot live without you. Maybe, I like you a little bit. Unfortunately, you are a guy. I'm going to get up and write my script. Don't move, let me hold you for a while. Go away, don't hold me, you sleep ugly. I sleep ugly? Far better than someone I know. Don't say it like that, I have evidence. How can that be possible. I'm sure I took the pictures. Luqiming, it... Luqiming, what's going on? I... What's wrong with you? Xiaoou, look at me, look at me. What is going on here? Am I dreaming? How is this possible, explain to me. Xiaoou, I can explain, don't be afraid. Go ahead, I'm not afraid. I'm already dead. Now you're looking at... This is too absurd, too rediculous. Xiaoou, listen to me, listen to me, don't be afraid. Don't come over. Xiaoou. You are lying to me from beginning to end, Xiaoou. Of all the things you say, what is true and what is false? How much are you hiding from me? How much are you not telling me? Xiaoou. Xiaoou. I need to be alone, I need to sort things out myself. Xiaoou... Why do you look so unhappy? What are you bothering about? Yiting, Luqiming, he... What's up with him? He... he is... What is he? He... okay, he said he likes me. I have seen all this. Sure enough, as I expected. Don't you find it strange? Yexiaoou, you are a young man in the new century. Keep up with the times. What's wrong with men falling in love with men? What's wrong with being different? Is anyone hindered? Has the development of society stopped? Besides, everyone is busy now. No one has the time to judge you. What matters is whether you accept yourself, you know? Actually people are okay with this. Baiyiting, aren't you mad at me? Why should I be angry? I'm happy. It's either your mother forcing you or my mother forcing me that's why we're together. Actually, I am very happy that you found true love. Qiming is really good to you. Since the two of you shared the house, I knew he was interested in you. He loved you so deeply. It's your head that's too stubborn to find out. Think about it. How could a man be jealous when he sees a woman as beautiful as me? Only him, that face is so full of jealousy. King of Asian jealousy. I'm telling you, it's time. Just be with him. - But... - No but. In this world, nothing stops true love except separation and death. Death. Suddenly I feel like my daughter is getting married, I'm gonna cry. Look at the love between Ms. Bai and Ms. Xu. They're not only same-sex, but also from different species. Why do you have so many concerns? In the face of true love. Even across life and death, across time. I would return to my true love. What a great love! Go, go find your Qiming. Baby, I'm back! What are you looking at? Go! Don't disturb me while I enjoy the love of Ms. Bai and Ms. Xu. Baby, I'm back. This is the banana I bought for you. Why are you here again? Hi! It's okay, he'll leave right away. Okay, I'll be in the room. I'm waiting for you. What are you looking at? Just go! Starting from today, don't contact me if there's anything urgent. Don't even contact me when nothing is urgent, bye! Luqiming, Luqiming. Forget it, I know you don't want to see me. Luqiming, where are you? I only realized how uncomfortable I was when you were gone. I was so stupid, it took me so long to really see myself. Although you often bullied me it was only till we no longer fight, that I realize, I can't live without you. Luqiming, thank you for loving me so much. We've missed out on so much. I don't want to waste any second. I just want to be with you. Even death cannot do us part. I miss you, come back. I haven't made enough money. I'm not your sugar daddy yet. Come back, I'll agree to anything you say. You'll be in charge. Come back. Luqiming, you're finally back. Silly, I've always been by your side. Xiaoou, you may not remember. We first met when we were freshmen. It was a winter day like this, it was snowing, you were wearing a white jacket downstairs. That image stuck with me. I've never seen anyone who had eyes as pure as yours. Very beautiful. Days spent with you, living in the same dorm with you, those were very the happy days. You're happy every day. Why do you always bully me if you like me? When I saw you, I couldn't help but bully you. I like to see you get angry, like to see you flipping out. Before I knew it, I grew feelings for you. But I didn't want to scare you. I was afraid you wouldn't accept me. Then we wouldn't even be friends. I was afraid you'd end up with other people, so I threw away all your gifts from other girls. Let me tell you, I'm only at ease when you're in my arms. Only then, I feel like you're with me. I hoped to find a good time after graduation to tell you my feelings. But... I came back, because I wanted to tell you. I don't want to leave with any regret. But I realized I couldn't leave you. Like you said, I'm selfish. I thought about not telling you. I thought as long as I can be with you every day. I'd feel particularly happy. But sorry, I'm greedy, I'm selfish. I want more. But I can't feel anything. I couldn't even keep my picture. Luqiming, I... I can feel it. You have feelings for me, right? That night you didn't reject me. You cooperated. That night you... you were drunk. I entered your dream, with you. Luqiming, you animal. Who said I have feelings for you? You narcissist. I heard everything you just said. You... I don't want to give you time to repent. Then no more teasing from now on. Keep all your promises, and no more bullying. I promise you, anything. Look, it's going to snow again. Yes, it's snowing. Maybe it's is the last snow this winter. Last snow. Xiaoou, you don't have to hold that tight. No, I want to hold you tight. Our love is already fragile. If I don't hug you tight, I'm afraid you'll suddenly slip away. Silly. Do you believe in next life? Maybe. After you're gone, I'll marry Baiyiting. Then we'll have a boy, and you can come be my son. I'll name him Yeqiming. Quick, call me Dad. Seems like I didn't tire you out last night. You're looking for trouble? So itchy, don't touch me, hahaha. Tell me how to keep you by my side forever. Silly, rest assured. Nothing can separate us. We're the boss of our love. You mean it? You don't believe me? I believe you. What are you doing? Mr. Yexiaoou. Will you take Mr. Luqiming as your husband? A thousand times yes. Hurry up and put on the ring I returned. Xiaoou, I love you so much. But listen carefully, you married me. Whatever you say, Yexiaoou. Nothing will keep us apart. You have to believe me. We won't be separated again. I believe you. I can give you whatever you want. I want snow, like that night. Ok, close your eyes. Ok. Open your eyes. Wow, it's so amazing, so beautiful. I want to make a wish. What did you wish for? Secret. If I say it out loud, it won't come true. Come on, maybe I can help. Really? Of course. My wish is, I want to be on top. So? Aren't you always on top? Oh, I wasn't talking about that. Then what? Why are you here? I've always been here. Where's Luqiming? Luqiming? Who is Luqiming? You've met him before. What's the matter with you? The Luqiming in your novel. In the novel. Impossible. Baiyiting, you've hidden him. Please, tell me where he is. Yexiaoou, who's Luqiming? Are you hiding a woman? Please, tell me where he is. I don't know. Take your meds first. What meds? You forgot again. How will I spend the rest of my life? Take your meds. No, I'm not sick. Yexiaoou, I've never heard of it nor met Luqiming. The doctor said you have illusions caused by excessive creating pressure. You need to separate your reality and your dreams. You hear me? Take your meds. Get out. Xiaoou. - Out. - Xiaoou. Let go of me. Xiaoou, I'm not leaving. Out. Xiaoou, open the door, Xiaoou. Didn't you say we'd never be apart? Why do you always lie to me? I've looked for so long, and still no signs of Luqiming. The past, those memories, is like a dream. I've looked everywhere. Everywhere. It's like Luqiming just disappeared. Every day I wait for him to show up where I could reach out my arm and touch him. I believe he still exists. Somewhere in my heart. Is that you? Never disappear again without saying goodbye. Xiaoou, no matter how many obstacles. How difficult it is, I'll always come back. I will always be with you.
