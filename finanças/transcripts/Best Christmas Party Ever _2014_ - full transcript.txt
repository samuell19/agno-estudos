Are you excited for Tyrell's Christmas party? Jennie, there's a world of magic and wonder through that door. You just have to walk through it. It's gonna take more than that to make me blush. I know you're probably scratching your heads wondering why I would be throwing myself a Thanksgiving party of all holidays, and the answer to that is simple. I am thankful for all of you-- clients who have become lifelong friends, colleagues who have become family, and family who are my heart. Petra's Parties is New York's premiere event planning service. So, it is with a heavy heart that I make my exit. I shall be retiring after this Christmas season. It's time for the next generation to take the stage. And now let's get back to enjoying this wonderful party. And I'll see you all around. Thank you. I didn't see that coming. The element of surprise is-- The key to any successful party. Speaking of the next generation, there's someone I want you to meet. Great speech, Aunt Petra. So glad to see you. I want to introduce you to my right hand-man or in this case, woman. Jennie Stanton, this is my nephew, Nicky Forbes. It's a pleasure. I've heard so much about you. Smart, talented, but my Aunt failed to mention beautiful. Oh, well, thank you. Be careful of Nicky, he's a charmer. And please just call me Nick. Otherwise, I feel like a ten year old who's done something wrong. Nice to meet you, Nick. Nicky's going to be here helping us for the holiday season, so I want you to show him the ropes Teach him everything you know. Sure, It'd be nice to have extra hand during the busiest season. Nick, do you have any experience in event planning? Um, no. But I have been to several film premieres as an actor. Does that count? A few premieres? As if going to a party was the same as planning a party. In his defense, I saw the Gatsby premiere on Entertainment Tonight, and I got a lot of decorating ideas for my place. Decorating, Nat. Not the same. Right. Ooh! The Nutcracker. I love the Nutcracker. I used to play it as a kid. So, is he cute? Yeah I guess, but that's beside the point. No! Drummer boy goes on last. First lights, then ornaments, then tinsel. You're even uptight about the Christmas tree? This is supposed to be fun. This is fun. We're having fun. Last. So this cute guy... I never even should have admitted that to you. Her nephew, Nick. She said teach him everything you know, show him the ropes. For the holidays... I hope, but she's retiring and she announced to an entire banquet center she said, and I quote-- it's time for the next generation to take the stage. She obviously meant you. Or maybe not. So... are you into her? Right, Kim. You should have seen the look on her face when Aunt Petra told her I was helping out for the holidays. So judgmental. Like, it's party planning, it's not rocket science. I can throw a party. Remember that fundraiser I threw for the theater company? I do remember. You had a booth where people could put on undershirts and yell, "Stella." That's right. That was a great idea! Five bucks a pop, because who doesn't have the deep-seeded urge to yell-- "Stella!" Well, you'll only have to work with her for the holidays. That's why it's called seasonal help. Yeah, about that... Hey. Is all that stacking really necessary? People will devour it in seconds. Yes, it's really necessary. You eat with your eyes before your mouth. Presentation is important. Even on a passing tray? Yes. Okay, people! Thirty minutes and counting! Oh, hi, Nicky. You know Jennie, when Nicky was a child, he was always my very special little Christmas helper. Simply adorable. I'm sure. But he's all grown up. Put him to work. He needs to learn the family business. Let's find you some work. Here you go, Nicky. Take these to the launching table and then make sure all the centerpieces are-- Centered? I'm a fast learner. What are these? Saucisson en croute. Oh, cause they look like pigs in a blanket. Yes, technically, they're pigs in blankets, but you wanna to make the guests feel important, and saying "Pigs In A Blanket" doesn't sound very impressive. But at least they'll know what they're eating. Unbelievable. I love the honey accent. Perfect. Which one? You choose. Those are little Christmas trees in the pattern. You got it. You know what I'm saying? Cause otherwise you don't know what you're eating. I mean, what language are we speaking here? Jennie! I was just testing your theory. About what? Tell me, sir. Fine young man. Would you rather have a saucisson en croute, or a very sleepy pig in a blanket? Um. Sleeping pig? Good man. On you go. Thank you. You know, ratatouille was a simple dish yet the fancy name got its own movie. So there. Look. People are creatures of habit. They like what they know, and they know what they like. Don't you have a centerpiece to go center? Check it out. Great. You've delegated your first job. Second, technically. I'm really good at delegation. Just another of my many leadership skills. Even Batman had Robin right? Go build a tray. Another pig slumber party coming up. Batman had Robin? Look at him. He's a natural. People love him. Yes, they do. I knew it. Knew what? It's in is blood. Take him with you to the Tyrell meeting. Really? I want him to see you in action. O-okay... Nice to finally meet you, Todd. Likewise. Have you been here before? No, but I know it's the chef from the Dell. Yes it is. You've done your homework. Knowing where the best chefs are is part of my job. And you're the best aren't you? Come on, don't be bashful. I've done my homework, too. I read the Times' Weekend piece on the company. It was Petra's picture, but you had all the quotes. I'm more behind the scenes. Well, that's a pity, someone as beautiful as you. So. Tyrell's Toys... Yes. Right. Sorry, you'll have to excuse me. Tyrell's is somewhat of a new acquisition for Piedmont, and while portfolios are big on numbers they're woefully short on traditions. Please, tell me about this Christmas party. Well, the party and Arthur Tyrell are actually very near and dear to my heart. Without getting into the particulars, let's just say as a child it changed my life and is the reason I got into event planning. Wow, that's some endorsement. Now we'll have to do it. Was there a question as to whether you would? It's money, Nick. Everything's a question with money, But, Jennie, I think it's your lucky day, because I want to give you the answer you want to hear. Thanks, I was-- Now, tell me, do you like Christmas lights? Um, yes, but-- Are you off Monday night? We're like the theater. We're dark Monday and Tuesdays. And I always have a lot of work to do-- I'm not gonna take no for an answer. You're having dinner with me Monday night. How can you be so sure? Because I'm going to show you the most amazing Christmas light display you've ever seen. Well, how can I say no to that? You can't. Okay, then. Sure. That guy didn't hear two words about the party, because he's too busy hitting on you. I mean, he asked you on a date, how unprofessional is that? Thanks for the insight, Nick, but my personal life is none of your concern. Look, I'm just saying. I know guys like that. I was one. Totally smooth-- I'm pretty sure he's got veneers, too. Just be careful. You're seriously talking about his teeth? Well yeah, teeth bite, okay! We don't have time for this, Nick. We have a party tonight. Hey, Nick, where's Petra? Just me tonight. Why? What happened? Aunt Petra's feeling under the weather. Is she okay? Yeah, it's just a cold. She'll be fine. But she filled me in, and I'm up to the challenge. No offense, but you have no experience. Maybe not, but The Party with Peter Sellers is my favourite movie. Okay, now you're just trying to push my buttons. I kinda am. Do you like the lights? I like them. They remind me of-- Tyrell's, right? Aunt Petra used to take me there as a kid. Can you actually help me with something? Sure. Climb on up here. Just... hold this... right... Okay, that's great. Do you remember the fake snow at Tyrell's? Are you kidding? That was my favourite part. We can't use it anymore. It gets in the ducts and it damages it over time. You can't insure it. You can't learn that from a film premiere. Say what you want about L.A., but it is one big party. All glitz and spectacle. Parties are not just all glitz and spectacle. Parties can change lives, too. Ashley Williams' thirteenth birthday party changed my life. First kiss slow dancing to Can You Feel The Love Tonight. Who knew The Lion King could be so romantic? You're a child. I am not having this conversation with you. Hi Petra. Yeah, I heard. Nick's... my man. Okay... Yeah, feel better. Told you-- I'm your man. You're bartending. Got it. Heeey! So ladies what do you get when you cross a vampire with a snowman? Frostbite. Jennie! The lady in charge. More wine please. You serving now? I help out when help's needed. It's part of my leadership skills. Hey while I getting some wine, why don't you tell us a joke? Oh I'm not funny. Sure you are. Come on, one joke. There's a wonderful audience, they laugh at everything. My heavy pour helps, of course. I just remembered there's wine in the kitchen. Jennie Stanton, ladies and gentlemen. Hey, cover me, okay? Jennie, I'm sorry about that. I was just having fun. I produce the party. I don't need to be the opening act. I honestly didn't mean to embarrass you out there. I apologize. Apology accepted. Thank you. Go! Yes, of course! Great job, everyone! Put that on on my desk. I appreciate it. ...I just don't know how I'd look in a grass skirt. Jennie, where did you find him? Hi, Bridget. I see you've met Nick. He's going to be helping out for the holidays. Bridget just finished sailing around the Hawaiian Islands for-- two weeks was it? Yes, and I'm ready to go back! Sounds fabulous. Are you ready to discuss the Senior Arts Center? I'm ready. Would you mind if I sat in? I don't mind. Sure, why not... Great! So, Bridget, picture a formal sit down candlelight dinner, with nice, crisp linens, fine china, a cellist, an ice sculpture celebrating the arts. Well, it sounds nice, and I know if anyone can make it special, it's you, Jennie-- But...? You see, when I was on that cruise, I felt young again, and all because I got a chance to wear a sundress and go dancing. Pool party, I like it. That's an insurance issue. Okay! So we will scrap the cellist and hire a really great cover band! It could be sort of a time machine into the hits of the past. Seniors are nostalgic enough. I don't want to remind them of glory days, I want to make them feel like these are their glory days. You felt that way on your cruise didn't you? Like Columbus must have felt when he discovered the free world. Anything is possible, and nothing can top this moment, right here, right now. Exactly. I felt young, alive, and full of hope. Okay, we'll design a theme that embodies all of those things. I don't know why I didn't see it before. Bridget, you're a genius, you had this idea all along. I did? You did. Mele Kalikimaka. Hawaiian Christmas? Really? Yeah! Why not? It's not very traditional. Bridget, from my experience the Senior Arts Center values tradition. Bing Crosby sang the song. It doesn't get more traditional. Picture this. A laid back, tropical theme. Everybody's wearing Hawaiian shirts, we'll serve mai tais. We'll even have a high-def projector with the islands on a background. Where's the Christmas? Surfing Santa? I love it. We can give everyone a flowered lei when they arrive. Hula dancers and a ukulele band. Yes! It's genius. All you, Bridget. We just listened. Alright. Hawaiian Christmas it is. Talk soon, Bridget. Aloha! You hijacked my pitch. You were dying in there. I was just helping you out. You can't make a pitch without any sense of cost or timeline. You're just mad she liked my idea better than yours. I'm mad, because you've chosen a theme that's hard to elevate. Bridget may think she wants this, but she's not going to when it looks like a frat party as opposed to a classy event the way it should be! Classy like the funeral you were pitching? They're seniors, Nick. Conservative. They're artists, Jennie. They wanna cut loose. Enough. You two. My office. Now. You two need to learn to work together. Now, what do you have to say to one another? It was my account, it was my mistake for inviting you into the meeting. I may have overstepped my boundaries, I was just trying to help you throw a party. You throw a baseball. You plan a party. Whatever. You should have asked me to step outside for a minute and talk. Never talk in front of the client. Okay. That was my bad. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Fine. We good? Nicky, would you excuse us for a moment, please? Nick is family. It's important you can work with him. You said that. Listen, it'll probably be good to have an extra hand for the season. Not just the season. He's going to take over the mantle from me. I see. You're hurt. No, I just thought-- never mind. There will always have a place for you here, but I need to take care of my family. I hope you can understand that. Sure. I have a lot of work to do. Can I buy you a hot dog? A hot dog? I'm trying here, Jennie, a hotdog truce. We gotta work together. I don't know, Nick. I have a lot to do. Don't make me beg. I played a pauper in a A Christmas Carol, and I was a terrible beggar. Look at this: Please, sir, alms for the poor. Hot dog for the poor. You played an old woman? No. Offer's going once, going twice, thrice, don't make me count to four, because I don't know what it is. Fource? Founce? Okay! I said okay. Okay. I'll go. Good. Your table is this way, madame. Mademoiselle. What's the difference? Well, one has someone to grow old with and watch their grandchildren open presents on Christmas morning. I get it, the other is empowered and independent. And single. Why do you think that is? I don't know. Why do you think that is? You seem to have an opinion on the matter. Well, I think you carry a lot of stress, and just maybe you have a hard time having fun. Enough psychoanalysis, Dr. Feel Good. I know why I'm single. Do tell, please. It's because I compare everyone to my father. He had an imagination like no one else I've ever met. Had? He passed away two years ago this Christmas. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. I bet he knew how to have fun. Yeah, he definitely knew how to have fun. But he was also very responsible. You know, when I was a kid, he got laid off, he took three part time jobs just to make ends meet. He'd do anything to support his family. But he was also a proud man, and he'd never ask for anything. So, I did. I don't follow. Tyrell's Toys Christmas party. I was seven years old, and I asked Santa for a job for my dad, and Arthur Tyrell hired him a week later. Talk about a Christmas miracle. Wow... yeah, no kidding. that explains why you love parties so much. Yep. My father. Arthur Tyrell. I guess most guys just fall short. So what about you? You want my story, you're gonna have to walk with me. It's cold. Gotta keep moving. Let's go! Okay. Thank you. My dad, Petra's brother, was in the military, so we moved around quite a bit. I was in one school after the next, and I got really good at telling jokes. If you're funny, kids just accept you faster. Acting's kind of the same thing, you just play the part and just hope that the audience accepts you. Makes sense. The problem is the part's not you. So, I said forget it, and walked out of my fourth call back for a soap opera and I came here. The thing is-- I catch myself still doing it-- like the other night at the bar with those girls. I get in a social situation, and I become the entertainer. It's like auto pilot or an appliance that's always on. I'm basically a clock radio. You're not a clock radio. I don't know... I made you laugh. You're not on now are you? No. My charms don't seem to work on you. You know, before today, I never would have said this-- What? I'm not really a fan of the entertainer. I like the guy right here, right now. I don't know what to say to that. But... thank you. We better get going on Hawaii. It's so peaceful up here. I'm sensing a long day. Yeah, work politics I guess you could say. Not fun. You wanna talk about it? Petra has just hired her nephew and it's been really hard trying to get someone up to speed on the way we do things while going through our busiest season. Family nepotism. I know it well. Really? My father has a successful manufacturing business, and every summer, my brother and I would work for him when we were kids. When I graduated from college I just figured we'd both get our chance, but-- He gave it all to your brother. I could stand on my own two feet, is what he said. He meant it as a compliment, but it didn't feel like it at the time. So what'd you do? The only thing I could do. I shook it off and stepped up. Now, don't get me wrong, it still hurt, but I learned that right and wrong... it's not black and white, and that one person's right is another person's wrong. Jennie, it's all gonna work out. You know how I know that? How? Because everything that happened to me brought me right here to this moment. With you. You're right. So, where are the Christmas lights you promised me? Well, everyone knows the Empire State Building gets lit up for Christmas, right? Well this year, many more buildings have signed on. I read about this. They want to turn on the lights on 12 days before Christmas. Wait, is that-- Tonight. Actually, uh, any second in fact. Wow... Merry Christmas, Jennie. Merry Christmas. You're here early. How was your date? What? Todd. Business was good, and the rest is none of your business. I don't trust that guy. He wears too much cologne. It's too early for your commentary, Nick. Hawaiian Christmas. Go. Okay. You ready for this? So I was thinking, the buffet over here. Bookended with inflatable palm trees. And then have the hula dancers over there. Inflatable palms run the risk of sagging or popping. I'd go for cut outs that are sturdy. I'd also use gossamer drapes to create a waterfall. Tiki candle holders. And lots of colored Christmas lights. Oh, and can the buffet. This is Hawaiian barbecue time. I love it. Do you see how much fun we're having? Is that what this is? Yeah! I'm an idea guy, and you know the details. Idea guy? Yes, admit it-- Hawaiian Christmas was right up there with french fries stuffed with ranch dressing. Why haven't you won the Nobel Prize? Laugh it up, okay, but seriously. I'm like the architect and you're the interior designer. Don't flatter yourself. Great job girls! Keep smiling! Wonderful, wonderful! Keep it up, keep it up! That's right! Heyyy there, how are you? Wow. That was impressive. How's it going? Good. Dr. Feel Good has it all under control. Good. Anything you need from me? Have fun! Mele kalikimaka! Great job, team. Maybe you'll even limbo a bit later. Limbo? Yeah, it was a last minute addition. Petra! Hey, Bridget! How are you? Hello, darling. Jennie, Nick. You've outdone yourselves. Thanks, Bridget. Thank you. Who's your date, Bridget? This is George. My daughter and son-in-law had to go out of town, so duty calls... Yes, well. How do you do, George? Hi there. How ya doin', Buddy? You excited for Santa to come? Did you know that before he even packs his sleigh, he sends all his elves and reindeer to scout every roof top. They do? Do you wanna go look for elf and reindeer prints with me? Can I? You boys go have fun! Alright, let's go man. Let's do it man, you and me. And you two are free to limbo! Thank you. Where's your friend? Uh, he's asleep in a chair. I think it was the punch. Yeah, must have been. You find any reindeer tracks? No, but they might be covered in snow. We did think we saw some elf prints by the elevator, though. Oh, yeah. How do you know they were elves? Elves have small legs and they hate stairs. Everybody knows that. Right. Right, obviously, yeah. Nick, you did a really good job tonight. This was a lot more fun than a sit-down dinner. Well, I couldn't have done it without you. You saved me with your gossamer waterfall and your palm cut-outs. So, thank you. I was just doing my job. Listen, Nick, I'm sorry if I've been a bit short with you. It's okay. Aunt Petra stuck you with me, and you resent me, I get it. I did, but it's not because you're Petra's nephew. It's because you're good. I wish I could handle clients the way you handled Bridget. I didn't exactly handle her. I was just making conversation. I'm a good listener. It's the key to being a good actor. You're not acting now. I don't act with you. I don't have to. There you are. Hey, Kim, hi! Kim, this is Jennie. Jennie, Kim. Hi. Kim's an old friend, and Petra said she could work the party. How do you guys know each other? We were in theater company together in LA. Nick was Stanley to my Stella. How long ago was that? Five years? Six. Wow. Well, we kept in touch on Facebook, but it was amazing to finally reconnect. I'm sure. Nick, you still up for drinks after work? Absolutely. I would have invited you, I just figured you'd have plans with Todd. Oh, no, I do, I have plans. Y'know. But no thank you, no thank you. All good. We're gonna hit this new club in Soho. Alright, well I have to go pay the fire eater. It was very nice meeting you. Bye-bye. Yeah! So... If we go with the Nutcracker theme. I was thinking we could put the giant presents here, and then we could put the ballerinas over here, and then line up toy soldiers along this wall here. Oh, and I was thinking we could put colored foil on all the tables and walls to reflect off the lights, creating that jewel box effect. Beautiful. Have you listened a word I said? Am I gonna be tested? No. Then, of course. Look, I know it's going to be beautiful. Really, I just have a few details from this side-- which I could have emailed, but I figured if I got you here, I could twist your arm to play hooky this afternoon. It's a present from one of our partner companies. Todd, I'd love to, but I can't. Christmas Eve is just ten days away. And I have so much work to do. You're breaking my heart. I'm going to have to give these away. I'm sorry. I hope you understand. I do. Completely. This party means a lot to you. It does. Well, let me just give you a few more details that will make me look good to Mr. Mitchell and the board. Shoot. Okay. Caviar bar-- sturgeon. VIP room with waitresses dressed as Elves or Mrs. Claus. Whatever you want. You can hire them from the sports bar around the corner if you need to. Oh, and Piedmont has a small stake in Lamborghini, so we could even get a red one, test drive Santa's sleigh kind of thing. But that would only be if you have Platinum level wrist band. What's the matter? This is just a very different approach than what the public are expecting. Public? You didn't read the files on the previous parties. Traditionally, we do a toy drive and provide a hot turkey dinner for those in need. Okay, well, we'll have a section for them. Like the kiddie pool at the country club. Jennie, you're the best at what you do. If anyone can figure out a way to meet everyone's needs, it's you. But Tyrell's Toys party is about inclusion and community not about VIP rooms and wrist bands. I know but sometimes to maintain the old, you have to incorporate a little new. Right? Jennie, like you, I have a boss I have to answer to, but I trust you to make a party that will make both of our bosses proud. Mr. Mitchell, this is Jennie Stanton. Nice to meet you, Sir. John. Please. I'm very much looking forward to the Tyrell's Toys' party. Piedmont represents a very large family, Ms. Stanton, and this party allows us an opportunity to celebrate that family. I'll do my best, sir. I'm counting on it. I read the Times Weekend article. I'm counting on you, too, Todd. I won't let you down, sir. Good day, Ms. Stanton. Good day. See what I'm up against... You'll figure it out. So. How's Tyrell's coming, Jennie? Good, I met with John Mitchell today, and I have a concept approval meeting, in the morning, at the hall with Todd Perry. What's the concept? The Nutcracker Suite. Really? Yeah, really. I loved the Nutcracker as a kid. It's true. I took him when he was four. Front row seats. I swear he tried to crawl up on to the stage. A born actor, weren't you, Nicky? I loved that world. All the color and the music. You could almost taste it-- That's not a bad idea-- Nutcracker Ice Cream. Huh? And what's happening about the Mazzucca Children's Center? At the moment, I have a team transforming their place into the Land of Sweets. Ordered a bunch of gingerbread houses for a decorating contest and we have Santa Claus as a judge. You talked to them without me? I asked Nicky to take it off your hands. The Land of Sweets. That sounds wonderful. The children will love it. Yeah! And you remember Kim from the other night-- well, she sometimes works events at the expo. She passes out flyers. And meets a lot of people. Kim is a people person, and vendors like to chat up pretty people persons. Charming. She got me a great deal on the gingerbread houses. Great work, team. Keep me posted. Hey, hey. I'm just trying to help out with Mazzucca. I know. I know. I'm just under a lot of pressure. You were lying about Piedmont going well, weren't you? How could you tell? I know bad acting. And you are a bad actor. You're terrible, actually. Thanks a lot. It's okay-- your secret's safe with me. Piedmont doesn't want Tyrell's Toys, he wants Soho House meets Cabaret. Okay. Well, if you want to brainstorm. You know that I'm-- --an idea guy. I know. I'm good. Okay, fine. Why do you look like that, Nick? Like what? Like you're disappointed in me. Well for someone who preaches community so much, you seem to prefer to be a party of one. Why don't you send me an evite or something if you change your mind. Want a hot dog? I'm meeting Kim for dinner-- Oh, I'm sorry-- No, no, no! Don't be. I am not gonna pass this up. Kim would sooner eat her foot than one of these things. Okay... She probably could. She's pretty good at yoga. I'm sure. Would you mind coming with me? I'd like to ask your opinion on something. Absolutely. So... any thoughts? This is amazing! This is going to be so much fun! But where's the mouse king? You forgot about the mouse king! He's like, a little scary, isn't he? Yeah, but every good story has a villain to overcome. The mouse king destroys the Nutcracker, but with a little magic the Nutcracker's restored and leads the toys in revolt against the evil mouse king. And everybody lives happily ever after. The mouse king is adversity. And adversity defines us. You know, I never thought of it that way. It's not just a story. It's life. And here I thought you just liked the thought of a mouse in a costume. I do. Don't get me wrong. That's totally cool. What's so funny? Oh, hey! Uh, mice in uniform. Is that another one of your crazy ideas? No. Actually, this one's Jennie's. She using the Nutcracker theme for the Tyrell's Toys party. Cool. You ready to get your skate on? You betcha! You guys are going skating? Yeah, Rockefeller. This is outstanding, Jennie. Really. Great seeing you, Jennie. You, too. Call me if you need anything. Thanks, Nick. Hey, Nat. Are you busy in an hour? Todd's going to love it. Don't worry. Nick did. Even though I've been a total jerk to him lately. Nick, the guy who's taking your promotion? I'd be mad at him twenty-four-seven. I know, but he's a good guy, and he's got this amazing-- What? Imagination. So what-- he's still taking your job. No, that's what I always say about my father. Amazing imagination. Are you crushing on this guy?! No. No, not at all. You totally are! No! He's not even my type. Besides, he's dating some actress named Kim. Eugh. Actresses. They're always so cute. Is she cute? As a button. You're not helping, Nat. Okay, just forget about the guy. Give Piedmont their party and get Petra to reconsider her decision. You're right. The party. Eyes on the prize. Then fall head over heels in love with Todd and live life happily ever after. That's what I'd do. Of course you would. Hi, Todd, thanks so much for coming in. No worries. We're missing one of the ballerinas, but you'll get the idea. Music please? Nutcracker theme. Toy soldiers as waiters. Giant presents. Even a mouse king. A mouse king? You know, like a mascot. Cartoony and friendly. Don't worry. So the idea is to enter a child's imagination while still keeping the event classy for your other clients. We can have Santa over here in this area for the kids. That area should be able to accommodate forty children then I was thinking we could have the hot turkey dinner over here-- we may need to add more chairs depending upon the numbers from the shelters. Shelters? It's the tradition. Okay, stop the music. Jennie, I thought we talked about this. A baby pool-- open to the public, that's it. This is an ocean. It's not an ocean. We'll still do the VIP room. I was thinking in the smaller ballroom. But this is where you're putting all the money. This room. The 24th is less than a week away. I need to think, and we need to get this sorted out now. Of course, your office? No, yours. I don't want Mr. Mitchell dropping in. I'll be there in an hour. Hopefully I can find some way to salvage this before it becomes a complete disaster. I'm sorry, Jennie, I really am, but this is not what Piedmont or I was expecting. Just through this way... Over already? Before it even started. You can go. I just got here. Yeah, the party's over. What happened? I can't do it, Nick. I can't give them what they want, and deliver the people's party. Come with me, I wanna show you something, okay? I'm not in the mood for elf prints and reindeer tracks. That's okay, 'cause you're not getting any. Come with me. What do you see? Look, I appreciate what you're doing but-- Just have some vision, okay? I'll tell you what I see. Over here, I see kids who think Santa's not coming this year, because their family has fallen on hard times. And then I see those kids' faces light up when Santa gives them exactly what they want. And over here, I see those kids' parents who think life's given up on them being treated to a VIP dinner and realizing that it hasn't. And over here, I see a little girl so mesmerized by what your imagination dreamed up that she's inspired to do the same thing some day. Thank you Nick, but Todd doesn't see it that way, and just 'cause you can envision it, doesn't make it real. I'd need a Christmas miracle to save all this. They do happen, Jennie. You said so yourself, remember? The element of surprise is-- --key to any successful party. I appreciate what you're trying do, Nick, but I need to go talk to Todd now. Todd, I've been thinking a lot, and-- So have I. We can use curtains to create the VIP room in the main space, and-- You're fired, Jennie. What? Believe me, it's not what I want, but there's no arguing with John Mitchell. Did you even try? Look, I don't expect you to understand this today or tomorrow, but I hope at some point you'll reconsider. Reconsider what? Us. I was going to give this to you at Christmas, but I don't know if I'll get that chance. I found it in the Tyrell archives. Look, I'll give you a call you in a few days. I'm really sorry, Jennie. Goodbye. Bye. Hello. What? You're kidding... Back by Christmas Eve? I don't know. It's late here, I gotta process this. You've reached Nick Forbes. You know what to do and when to do it. Todd fired me, Nick. Tyrell's is done. Talk to you later. Yeah, okay. I'll give you my answer tomorrow. Okay. Todd fired me, Nick. Tyrell's is done. Talk to you later. Are you okay? I got the part. So, why aren't you happy? Piedmont fired Jennie. That party means everything to her. Listen, can you cover me here? I'm gonna go to Piedmont and try to talk some sense into Todd. Sure. Thanks, I owe ya. Todd, can I have a word? No. Jennie Stanton's the best at what she does. You're making a huge mistake. Please give her another chance. You don't think I want to? I like Jennie, and I think she's hugely talented, but it's done. Then undo it. It doesn't work that way. Why not? Come on man, it's Christmas. It's not Christmas, Nick. It's my job. Look, I like Jennie, I do, but we're just on different pages on this one. Now if you'll excuse me. Hey Petra. I'm just giving Jennie an assist with Tyrell's and need the past attendance lists. Do you have those? Sure, I think so. That's it. Perfect, thank you! You're welcome. Looking for someone? Hi, Jennie. Hi Mr. Tyrell! How are you? Well. I'm here! I was hoping I'd find you still putting on the suit. I sold my store, but not my heart. So what's on your mind, Jennie? It's Piedmont, Mr. Tyrell. They fired me. And if it was any other event, I'd give them the most exclusive party ever, but that's not what Tyrell's Toys is about. The party is about the people. We even shook hands on it. In my day that used to mean something. Petra's already looking at her nephew as heir apparent. When she finds out I lost this party, there's no telling what she's gonna do. She's not going to fire you. What do I do? Close your eyes and tell me what you see. Humor an old man. I see your Christmas party as a child, I see my father coming home from work with the Christmas twinkling lights behind him, I see the look of joy on all the kids' faces at your party. That's what's in your heart. Listen to it, and you'll always find your way. What's going on? There's some people here who have something to say to you. Thank you. Thank you. I-- I don't understand. You touched each of these people in past Tyrell's Toys' parties. When we needed it most. When we'd lost hope. You made sure we had Christmas. They're real, Jennie. Not imagination. Who needs a Christmas miracle when we have each other, right? You're right. We're going to do Tyrell's Toys without Piedmont. Ha! There's the Jennie Stanton we know and love, ladies and gentlemen! Jennie, did you hear Nick's big news?! No, what? Remember that soap opera I was called back for? Well, I got the part. Oh, wow. We're going to Dino's tonight to celebrate. No one deserves it like you do. Thanks. Since when did you start eating hotdogs? Don't ask. I got the works on yours. Okay, so. What's so urgent? Nick's leaving. That's great news. That means you'll be taking over for Petra. Yeah. So what am I missing here? He just did the most incredible thing for me. Nat, I don't want him to go. So, tell him. Go to him right now and pour your heart out. He's at Dino's with Kim. You've got to tell him how you feel. Hey, Aunt Petra, you have a minute? For you? I've got a whole watch full of 'em. What's on your mind, Nicky? I got a part. Really? On a soap opera. I haven't said yes yet. I was hoping to get some advice. Is it in your heart? It is, there's just a lot going on in there. Nick I've lived a lot of dreams in my life-- studied in Paris at twenty, camped in the Serengeti at thirty, built this company to be what it is today, but I've learned if I try to hold on to any of those dreams too long, I wake up. And I don't wanna wake up. So, when I feel one dream coming to an end, you know what I do? What? I dream another dream. Now for you, it might be New York. You're a natural at this business. Or perhaps it is L.A. and that soap opera. What if it's an impossible dream? And please don't ask me to sing for you. But you were so cute as Sancho Panza in junior high. I'm serious. Well, you won't know if it's impossible until you dream it, will you? That's a good point. Thanks, Aunt Petra. Okay. Jennie Stanton? I'll take them. Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Tyrell. Arthur. You seriously have no idea how much your involvement means to me. Okay, See you soon. I ran into the delivery guy in the lobby. They're from Todd. Figures. He feels bad. They're beautiful. There's thirteen of them. A bakers dozen. I counted on the way in. Probably a baker who was an idea guy himself. Probably. That's a new one. I've never heard of a company sending flowers to someone they just fired. They're not from the company. I see. Nick, Todd's a good guy. He got me this for Christmas. That's Tyrell's. I'm Guessing the nineties. Was he trying to rub it in? Piedmont tied his hands. Why are you trying to make excuses for that guy? I'm not, it's just not that simple. I think it is. It's my agent. Just two seconds. Hi, Dean, yeah. My answer? Yeah, I'm in. Just send me the flight details. Thanks. Bye. The soap opera? Yeah. Yeah, it's all done. Look, at least this way I'll be out of your hair, and you and Petra can get back to the way things were. You're not in my hair. No, this is for the best. I gotta fly out on Christmas Eve. That soon? Yeah, I gotta do a wardrobe fitting, they wanna make sure my stuff is ready for the following week. I see. I can help you with the Christmas party, but I can't be there for it. No, I understand. Like I said last night, Nick, I'm really happy for you. Thanks. Nick! I wanted to tell you something. Yeah? Well, I just wanted to thank you again. For yesterday... no one's ever done anything like that for me. You're welcome. Promise me something... What's that? No matter what happens or what anybody says-- you plan the greatest Christmas party this city's ever seen. Okay, so I know we can't call it Tyrell's Toys, but there's not any law against calling it Arthur Tyrell's Annu-- Nutcracker Dream. Arthur Tyrell's Nutcracker Dream. Love it. You are an idea guy. And I'm gonna need all your big ideas. Any elements you think will bring the theme to life, bring 'em on. We've only got a week and that's not a lot of time. You've got the soldiers and the ballerinas. I know a girl who does costumes for theater, I'll get in touch with her. I'll get started on the mouse king. And oh! I've got this friend who does special effects for Christmas movies. We're talking an indoor snow machine that uses soap and water. Awesome. And, Kim, can you talk to your vendor contacts? Tell them we'll run this event through a charitable corp and be able to provide any receipts for taxes-- on anything we can get. Decorations, alcohol, food. You got it. And Nat, you're the best artist I know. I need a quick design for advertising, and an assist on saturating social networks with news about the party. Copy that. And Arthur, we're gonna need lots of toys. I know you can't exactly walk into Tyrell's-- I can do better. I can go straight to the manufacturers. And I can tell them about the tax write-off. Awesome. And Santa? Ho ho ho. I was hoping you'd say that. Thank you. You know Piedmont is going to find out about this, right? Yeah, well, the element of surprise is-- The key to any successful party. I know Arthur, and I'll take full responsibility. You know I've always said parties change lives. And this one is definitely going to change mine. Here we go, team! Hey, you got a minute? Sure. What's up? He fought for you. What? He went to that Todd guy's office and confronted him. Told him he was making a mistake. Really? Really. Why are you telling me this? Because it's romantic, and if a guy did that for me, believe me, I'd want to know. And the truth is, you're all he talks about... But I thought you and he were... We're better off as friends. How can you so be sure? Because I see the way he looks at you. I want him to be happy, Jennie. You make him happy. That is amazing! I didn't want the mouse king to look too scary. He doesn't look too scary, does he? No! He's perfect. I'm really proud of you, Jennie. Thank you. I couldn't have done any of this without you, Nat. Yes, you could, but I'm very happy to be involved. I love this. You're gonna give these kids a great Christmas. Thanks again. Do you remember when you made a blizzard in the middle of the summer for Christmas in the Canyon? Hey Jennie! You gotta come take a look at this thing! It was working a minute ago. I just want you to see it. I don't know how they do it, but I swear it's the real thing! It's awesome. You're getting my hopes up. Good. Ho, ho, ho. I just hope it works by tomorrow night. Oh, it will. Oh, it's Petra. Hi, Petra. I was going to tell you. Wait, what? Piedmont legal contacted you? I'm coming to you now. Cat's out of the bag? She's furious. Piedmont caught wind and they're threatening a lawsuit-- On what grounds? Apparently Arthur signed a non-compete clause. But this is a party? That was so he doesn't open his own toy store. I'm going to talk to her now. Hey, Jennie? Everything's gonna be okay. Alright? I'll talk to you later. You should have told me. I should have told you. But I guess I thought, deep in my heart, that you would fire me if you knew that I'd lost the account. and I thought just maybe if the party was a success that it would change things and mean something for me. Say something, Petra. Parties can change things. But they're about more than that. I think you've forgotten the definition of the word. Here we go. Party. A social event. A gathering of people. Jennie. You weren't alone when Arthur gave that job to your father all those years ago, and you're not alone now. We're in this together. Come here. You know you're just as much family to me as Nicky is. You're the daughter I never had. And a heck of a lot like I was at your age. Oh Petra, if it were any other party, I would have caved. I would have done anything they wanted. but Tyrell's does so much for the children and for those who won't even have a Christmas this year. You're right. Proceed. Really? Really. I'd have done exactly the same thing if I'd been in your shoes. So, you're not mad? No, I'm mad that you didn't tell me, not that we lost Piedmont. You're not worried about their threats? They're grasping at straws. Besides, I have lawyers, too. Now get back to work, you have a party to throw. Thank you, Petra. Thank you! More presents, Arthur? Not all corporations are run by Ebenezer. No, just the one that bought your toy store. How'd it go with Petra? She's amazing. So are you. Oh, thank you. You know, this Piedmont thing has really got me down a bit. But you taught me something. You taught me that people matter. You taught me that I matter, and that's really important. I'm glad. I can never repay you for what you did for me. You already have. And if we don't stand up for what's right, then who will? You're right, Arthur. Where you going? To go and stand up for what's right. Jennie, what are you doing here? I came to give this back. I don't understand. The Tyrell's Toys Christmas Party is not in a photograph. It's in here. Try and shut our party down all that you want, by you'll never shut down what it stands for. Generosity, kindness, love. That's Christmas, Todd. No lawyer in the world can shut that down. Jennie, our legal team saw your party on social media. I can't control their response. They're lawyers. That's what they do. I'm a party planner. That's what I do. Thanks anyway, Todd. Wow, it's looking good! How'd it go? You have a pretty amazing Aunt. She didn't care about Piedmont, did she? No. She cared about me. Come on, help me carry this guy. Okay. Just grab the legs. Sure. Oof! You got it. Yup. Okay, set it down. Perfect. Looking good! Who's more handsome? Uhhh, the nutcracker. Are you nervous? Yeah, big time. I've never worn an eye-patch before. You? No. I should be, but I'm not. It's because you got this. Jennie Stanton's Nutcracker Dream, ladies and gentleman. Oh, uh, you've just got a little... you've got some ketchup. Here-- Did I get it? A little trick I learned in college. Don't use your sleeve. Too late, got it. Oh, there's a little bit more. Is it gone? Yup. Okay. Are you sure? You know, I saw Todd today. Oh, yeah? Yeah. How's Todd? I told him we were done. Good riddance. I never liked that guy. Why? Because he wasn't right for you. He was a mouse king. And you, Jennie, are a nutcracker. Heroically leading the revolution for good-- one party at a time. I'm not a hero. You are to me. Are you going to be at the hall in the morning? Yeah, the network is sending a car to pick me up there. Come here. Don't squeeze me too hard, I have to emote, remember. I'll squeeze if I want. I'm your aunt. Yes, you are. I'm so proud of you. Those Hollywood types try and push you around, they'll have to answer to me. I will give them your number. You do that. I love you, Nicky. And remember you always have a place here. Thank you, Petra. How do I follow that up? Nobody can, that's why she has two ex-husbands. Thank you so much, Nick. I couldn't have done any of this without you. Imagination, Stanton. You saw it and you did it. Just remember, okay, have some fun. It is a party after all. I better go. Yeah, you don't wanna miss your plane. Are you happy, Nick? Well yeah, I mean, why wouldn't I be? you're looking at Dr. Stone Hunter, after all. No, I'm not. I'm looking at Nick Forbes. Don't make me cry, Stanton. I almost forgot. Wait. Merry Christmas. You didn't have to get me anything. I feel bad, I didn't get you anything. Yes, you did. Now, go. He's one of the good ones. Yeah. Yeah, he is. Fourteen minutes and counting. Hi, Arthur. You okay? Nick left. I heard. I let an amazing man get away without even an attempt to tell him how I feel. You know, Jennie, when I sold my store to Piedmont, I lived in regret for days and days. Thinking, this is it. It's over. But you know what? What? It's not over. The party is just beginning. I love you. Thank you, Arthur. Dear Nick, You said you feel like a clock radio that's always on. This is a clock radio. You are so much more. Merry Christmas. Love, Jenny. Hi, everyone, I just wanted to thank you all for everything you've done tonight-- donating services, time, food, toys. Words cannot express my gratitude. We did it. We did it together. Now let's start this party! Merry Christmas! Todd, there's something you need to see. The TV stations have picked up Arthur's party. I told you, sir, Jennie Stanton refused to listen to our needs. But people are going to think that's our party. Let the lawyers figure it out, sir. I want to go there. Excuse me? Look, Todd. They're obviously generating a lot of attention for their party. I want to see for myself. Make it happen. Piedmont just walked in. Just tell them to leave. Leave the party that's open to everyone? Ms. Stanton, this is quite a party. Jennie. Welcome to the VIP room. Petra, this is Todd Perry and John Mitchell from-- Piedmont. Ho ho ho! Arthur? John! Merry Christmas! Petra, your employee has co-opted a legally trademarked brand and she's gone rogue. She's-- The most amazing woman I've ever met. You're here. The element of surprise is-- Key to any successful party. But what about L.A.? I don't want that. I want you. Care to join me for a toast? Absolutely, Madame. So you're responsible for this, too? Yes sir, he's the other party planner. I wanna shake your hands! This is, this is just... It's just wonderful. I mean, did you see Arthur as Santa? That's brilliant! Todd, why on earth did you ever let this tradition go? Besides being a PR goldmine, this is the right thing to do. Sir, I just thought you wanted to cater to our clients. Another time! Todd, this is... Christmas? Yes, it is. And a merry one at that. Come along, Todd! Let's go help Santa. Well played, my dear. And what about you. Nicky? Are you back for good? If you'll have me. Absolutely. You two make a great team. I can't think of two better people to take the reins. You know, in all my life, I've never seen a better party. You're not gonna to make me choose pigs in a blanket again, are you? No, I am not. Thank you. There you are. Thank you. So you think we can make this work? I think so. Do you have plans for Christmas? Well, I was I was thinking we could go down to the park and skate. Now that is a plan. Merry Christmas, Nick. Merry Christmas, Jennie. To the greatest Christmas party ever! Oh yeah!
