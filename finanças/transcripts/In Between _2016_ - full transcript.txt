Don't raise your voice, men don't like women who raise their voices. Remember to always say a kind word, and cook him good food. Don't forget to put on perfume, and to keep your body smooth, so that when he desires you, he'll know where to ﬁnd you. In bed, do what he tells you. Don't let on that you know what you're doing. Cheers, cheers! Who's got the stuff? - I do. That's all you got, Ritalin? Girl, it's the hot thing in town. Crush it! Slut, where did you get that? Give it back. - Who's it from this time? Saleh, give it back. - You run on dope and scheming. Fucker! You live at my expense and complain? Give me a cigarette. Soon I won't even be able to smoke! Here, burn your lungs like there's no tomorrow. When you move to that fancy villa of yours in Kufr Yasif, you'll need the mayor's permission to light up. Bring it on! Hey bro, when did you get here? Sorry, I thought this is the bathroom. See you later. Who's he? Cheers! To the end of singlehood... Who's she? Layla, a friend. Man, I'm going to miss these outings. Where's that slut? We want to keep going! There she is. Where to? - "Shessek." Shall we catch a cab? What's happening at "Shessek"? Your playlist tonight was legendary. - Really? Yes, Mom. Good morning dear, still sleeping? I have a day off. Okay, just remember that next week your cousin's friend is coming to see you. Okay, Mom. I'll be there, you don't have to call every day to remind me. Wear a dress this time, you look good in dresses. Try to cover those drawings on your body, and remove that earring from your nose! Will you stop nagging about that? Okay. - Bye. Morning. My head is going to explode. Do me a favor, make me some coffee. Tell me about it... Thanks. Sweetie, who are you looking for? I'm Nour, your ﬂatmate Raﬁf is my cousin. Didn't she tell you I'm coming today? Ah... Nour. Welcome, come in. Yeah, welcome. Come in, dear. Welcome, Nour. What do you study? Computer Science. It's my last semester, I have ﬁnals now. Did you live in the dorms? Yeah, but they're renovating and it's noisy. Raﬁf, bless her, said she'd talk to you about staying here until I ﬁnd a place. Yeah, darling Raﬁf. Come, I'll show you your room. I'm Salma Zaatary from Tarshiha, and this is Layla Sakher from Nazareth. You're not from Haifa like Raﬁf, right? No, I'm from Umm Al-Fahem. My aunt, Raﬁf's mother, married a man from Haifa. Nice... You can let go of your suitcase, we won't snatch it. It has my laptop and stuff. DIWAN, TAWFIQ ZAYYAE It's the ﬁrst time I see you like this! Turn around, let me see. Stunning. Layla, what are you talking about? My tits are hanging out! Wow! Look at this. There’s a picture of my mom in a dress just like this, at my age. Those were the days... Back then everyone was Communist. But Communism is dead and buried, soulmate! Neither dead nor buried. I'm a living example, soulmate! Sure, you can go on being the idiot who lives upon its ruins. Ooooh... Communism, schmonunism. Got a dollar, you're worth a dollar. Got nothing, you're worth nothing. Look how pretty this is! Try it on, Laila. Right? Look! Excuse me, where's the ﬁtting room? There. Mother's cunt... We don't bite. This is the last one I'm trying on. Why wear that one, dear? You have many cheery dresses. Wear one of them. Your aunt is right. Enough with the black! You wear black every day, today wear something else! Okay, Mom, but no promises. Don't drive me crazy if it doesn't work out. We're not that backward. You can meet with him once, twice, three times, within reason, of course. Inshallah, it'll work out. I only want you to be happy. What more could I ask for? Inshallah, it will work out and he'll be a decent man. You heard right, Abu George. Yours truly, sells 1,000 chickens a day. A thousand chickens! Not to mention that I market to 50 supermarkets in the north! Well done. - Thank you. What Salma doesn't know, is that I'm building a house that overlooks all the town! 400 square meters! Welcome, Jamil. - Thank you, Auntie! Why didn't you ﬁnish the pudding? Didn't you like it? On the contrary! It's delicious, thank you. I put in extra carobs for you. God bless you, you shouldn't have troubled yourself. Go ahead, help yourself. - Thank you. Salma, shall I cut you some grapefruit? - No. In the name of the cross. Raﬁf's movie is over. The end. At least she changed genre from action to melodrama. Come on, where is that princess? Did you tell her where we parked? Of course, I did. But she needs ﬁve hours just to close the jilbab... Come on, for God's sake. There she is. What the hell... Wow. - Oh my God. Let me help you. There's no room, sweetie. Put it on the backseat, next to you. Loosen up, girl. Loosen up for God's sake. Give me that. Oh, God help me. Check out her IO. That's it, I can't watch anymore. Hello. Emad, friend of the groom. Laila, friend of the bride. How about a joint? Hello to you, Nazarene girl! Last hit? Are you kidding me?! Morning. Good morning. I've heard of dawn prayers, not morning prayers! How the hell should I know...? Good morning to you too. Good morning. - Good morning. Is it okay if my ﬁance comes over tonight? Sweetie, do you see a sign that says "women only" here? Bring whoever you like. Do you want us out of the house? What don't you get, Salma? Anyway, I have a ton of work. Salma, move your ass, I gotta go. I'm coming. Layla Shaker in the Magistrate's Court! See what money can do? Horrifying. Gimme a light. So Layla, what's up? If we're talking business... - Give it a rest! Let's close the Bouhbout case, once and for all. With the evidence I have in this case, I'm going for prison time. That's what I can tell you. I have no problem reaching evidentiary proceedings, Jonathan. Be my guest. But it'll be a shame. I say, let's close a deal here and now. So what are you ready to offer me? You retract your charges and he signs a no-offense commitment for ﬁve years. Fair enough. You have it all worked out, huh? Always. Okay, you got it. But this deal includes the dinner you promised but never delivered. Darling. Darling... Give me a break, we both know it's a waste of time. Why a waste of time? Your mother, Mrs. Halevy... - God bless her. Won't rest until she gets a kosher Jewish bride. Come on Layla, let's go with the ﬂow, who knows tomorrow Peace might erupt... And we'll hit the streets and do Palestinian folk dances together?! Jonathan, let it go, you're not built for it. Let's keep our ﬂirtation fun. Salma, gimme two lemons, please. Not now Yasser, I have a ton of work. The dish will burn! Hakmat, gimme two lemons, please. Fuck you, it fell on the ﬂoor. Throw me another one. What?! You know the rules! I'm telling you again, I don't want to hear Arabic! It's unpleasant for the customers, who just want to enjoy their meal, to hear you yelling in Arabic! Enough! Are the customers who "just want to enjoy their meal," allergic to Arabic? Salma! Shut up and go back to work. Neither of us makes the rules around here. If you dare talk to me like that ever again, you don't want to know what I'll do! What will you do, go on a hunger strike? You fucker! Making fun of me, are you? Okay... - Salma! Have it your way. - Salma, just tell him you're... What else could I do? The bastards planted in my cell a... What do you call it in Arabic, "asfour"? A motherfucking snitch, started talking about people I know, how could I suspect? Telling stories that only two people in town know, and one of them is me. Spare me... But every dog has his day. God willing, he'll get what he deserves. I'll get back to you later, bye. Qays! Layla? You ignoring my calls? You pest, I was at work! What do you want? You and your work... Tiny Fingers are playing "The Block," want a ticket? Sure, sounds good. Chill out! Okay, I'll call you later. - Bye. As-salaamu alaykum - Wa alaykum salaam, Nour. Are you in Tel Aviv? - Almost, what's the address? The neighborhood is called "Yemeni Quarter. " What's it near? Near the Hassan Bek Mosque, in what used to be Manshiyeh. Okay, I'm on my way. Couldn't your cousin Raﬁf, may God guide her, ﬁnd a ﬂat that's not in the center of Tel Aviv? I told you our people in the charitable society are ready to help. All I have to do is ask. We talked about this, Wissam. Jaffa is too far from the university, it'll take me two hours each way. What can I say. It's all temporary, either way. Oh yeah, I talked to my uncle, Abu Fuad, who talked to his friend, the headmaster. He promised to give you a job at his school. Even though as far as I'm concerned, it would be better if you stayed home. You know that a single salary isn't enough, I have to help you. The prophet, peace be upon Him, said: "Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque," though what? "Though their homes be better for them. " I don't need help. The best help would be you staying at home and raising the children properly. Anything you want will come to you. Hello. - Peace be upon you. Salma, this is Wissam, my ﬁance. Salma Zaatary from Tarshiha. Drive safe. May God protect you. Oops, sorry. It's okay. I ask God forgiveness for all sins. May God forgive all sins. I'll think of something, a solution. Inshallah, it will work out. Look! "Arab protesters attacked the police... " What did you expect them to write, the truth? Stop it. Is that your new ﬂatmate? Yeah, we got a new ﬂatmate. I thought Raﬁf's cousin was going to move in. What's with the face? Fuck off, Rabe'a. Nour, he's asking about you. Come sit with us. No, thanks. I have to study and get up early. All you do is study, darling? Trust me, you won't ﬁnd a professor hotter than me, come sit with us. Hello people. What's with the funeral faces? Hello. This is Ziad, from my hometown Taybeh. He's my cousin's friend, and my ﬂatmate from today. Rabe'a! - Hi! - I'm Salma. Make yourself comfortable. Come sit, Ziad. - Hi. What will you drink? A beer. Me too. Look what he's doing to him. Good evening. - Good evening. Oh my, the queen is home. Queen my ass... Look! Did you see the guy from Taybeh sitting there? He's hot! He's okay. - You wish! Why the sad face? Nothing, I had a shitty day and I feel like dying. What else is new... Oh, you haven't been introduced. Hello, Ziad. How are you, Layla? Can I shake your hand? How do you like the music? - It's cool. Here. Thanks. So, what brought you to this city? Life, just like everybody else. Is there no life in Taybeh? Yeah, but I don't really remember. I haven't lived there in a long time. Why, where have you been? In New York. Cool. What did you do there? I studied film and worked in production. And you, what's your story? I'm a very long story... I just remembered... I got some good stuff inside. Want some? Depends how good. There's no one inside. I guess they went out. Thanks. You should come with a warning sign. "Danger! Electrifying!" I wonder if it'll hit fast. That's what we want. I'm starting to feel it... You? This stuff is a motherfucker. I haven't felt my heart in such a long time! What? I've rediscovered it. Praise to God. - Indeed. What about you? Are you happy with your ﬁance? We've been together for a year and a half. He's from a good family and... - Do you love him, Nour? You know, the important thing is getting along. Love comes through companionship. That naughty Wissam! Hi! I saw you're looking for a bartender. Is the manager here? He went to get hummus, he'll be right back. You looking for work? A couple of minutes. Want a shot? Totally. Are you South American? I'm Palestinian. Wow, cool. Okay, cheers! - Cheers. Layla. - Yes? Why did you go silent all of a sudden? Oh, it's nothing. I realized that Ziad and I have been together for a while now. And this is the ﬁrst time that I cook for him. It's been a while since I cooked for someone. How does it feel? Kind of scary. I thought you'd say joyous. Don't worry, I'm the one cooking. I always cook for Wissam, nothing scary about it. It'll make you feel good, trust me. I won't tell anyone. You have to take it into your lungs. Inhale. No, this isn't for me. Damn, we burned the onions. Damn, get another onion. I'll do it again fast. Noun - Yeah. I found you a place to live. - In Jaffa? Yeah, in Jaffa. All right, what's the address? Gaza st 1 Go there now. - Yes, Wissam, I'll go. Thank God this one is leaving. Never in my life have I seen such a mess. How can she live like this? I guess it's a musicians' thing. As-salaamu alaykum. - Wa alaykum salaam. Did you go? - Yeah, how are you? Praise be to God. Did you like the ﬂat? It's okay. We'll talk later. - Okay. The rent includes electricity, water, and municipal taxes. Praise to God. - Where are you from? From Umm Al-Fahem. - Welcome. To you, Layla Sakher. To you, Ziad Hamdi. Would you like some salad? Sure, a little. Is it good? Did you really cook this? Who else? I hope you won't feed me potatoes and eggs, later on. I hope you'll always know how to choose wine. None of the girls are here? I love you, Layla. I love you. Can you turn it down? I'm trying to study! I'm going to DJ a big rave. It's my ﬁrst time, I have to prepare. What's a rave? Never mind, use headphones. I want to ﬁnish studying before Wissam comes. But the headphones are broken, Nour. Since I'm not studying, you're going to help me clean. Now?! - God knows when you cleaned the house last... Wissam's on his way and I'm not dressed. How long do you need? A few minutes. A many minutes is a "few"? I'm done, I swear. Hello. - Where are you? I'm sick of this city! I'm stuck in trafﬁc. No problem, I have to hang up. - Nour! What's wrong? I'm done. Don't worry! I ruined the food. It's on me. Thanks. Salma. - Dunya. How about you come over for coffee? Cheers. What do you mean you don't want to move up the wedding date? I found you another ﬁat, you didn't want it. I told you we can get married and I'll drive you every day, like a queen. You don't want that either?! You know I'm under a lot of stress because of my studies and exams. It's not a good time to get married. I don't want you to stay in this city, especially not in this house. Okay. If you don't want to change the wedding date, ﬁne. But move to Jaffa and I'll buy you a car, so you can drive to the university. Until you get through the next few months. But I'm happy here with the girls. They're not like you think, they're very good. They've ruined you to the point that you don't see how impure they are. You've started eating the garbage they do! Where is the bathroom? Nouﬂ What is this? What is this?! I'm sure you know, you've become a whore, like them. You know very well I'm not! Layla and Salma also aren't... Shut your mouth! I don't want to hear! Start packing, you're coming home with me to Umm Al-Fahem, right now! Enough. Enough, Nour. You know how much I love you? Wissam, what... What are you doing? Wissam, let me go. Sweet Dunia! What a shitty shift! Fuck it. Layla... - Yeah? Layla... Any chance you catch a cab, and I continue with her? You're going to get... Fool! Okay, I'm leaving, cool? Yes, cool. Bye, beautiful! - Bye. Get home safe. In the daytime, she's mostly normal. Poor thing! Come on, Layla... I have to go... It was a nice evening. We'll do coffee, yeah? - Perfect. Layla, are you okay? Sure? Yeah? - Yeah. I'm gonna be so hung over tomorrow... Fuck! - Quiet, Nour is sleeping. Layla, you okay? Come here right now! Asshole! Get up, sweetie. Lift your arms up, sweetie. Careful, it's hot. What should we do? Hello? - As-salaamu alaykum. Peace and God's mercy upon you, who is this? To be honest you don't know me, but I've heard a lot about you. How good and pious you are. Praise be to God. How can I help you? I can't talk about it on the phone... But I can only turn to you or God for help, after what happened to me. Okay sister, take it easy, and God will help. I'll be at the charitable society in two days. Come see me, and all will be ﬁne, God willing. The day after tomorrow? I'll be at my aunt's house the day after tomorrow. We can meet wherever you like, whatever works for you. The blue house next to Andre's. I have to hang up now. May God be with you. Pious my ass. Sugar? I didn't add any sugar cuz you didn't answer. Sorry, I didn't hear you. - Is everything okay? Yeah. Please... - Thanks. How do you like Tel Aviv? I just moved here, but I don't really like it. Obviously. This city is confusing, shocking. If it wasn't for the hospital residency, I never would've left Haifa. It's mellow there, in a way I can't explain. I can. It's called lethargy. What about you? Is every night at work a drinking night? No, personally I don't like to drink at work. But last night was special. We specialize in watering the broken hearted. They gather for a bitter drop at the end of the night. As Abu Nuwas said: "Cure me with my ailment. " Do your parents know you're a lesbian? I embarrassed you! Sorry, I didn't mean to. I speak before I think, then I say sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Wow, Layla. I wouldn't have recognized you. I wouldn't have recognized myself. What do you say, Nour? To be honest, it really suits you. - What?! I would never have recognized you. Congratulations, girl. This calls for a joint, no? Yeah, gimme a hit. I can't hear myself. And your father? - May he rest in peace. Only God has the might and power. Are you okay? God damn him, my body hurts all over. From the beatings? Of course, from the beatings. He has the hands of a construction worker. Look what he did to me. Inshallah, it will be okay. You see? It's all swollen. - Don't worry. Show me what that bastard did. - There, look at the back. My love, how are you? What? Don't you remember we reserved a table on Monteﬁore? Didn't we say we'd talk? Well, if you'd answered my calls... Didn't you get my message that I'm getting dressed and coming to get you? Ziad, is everything okay? I'll be right there. Hello. - My sister, Hanan. Hello. - Hello. - Layla Sakher. Pleasure to meet you. Hanan, don't be shy. Layla's a lawyer, she understands these things. Darling, get her a glass of water please. Want a cigarette? - No. They caught my son with grass last night. They arrested him, his father went to see him, after one of his friends told us what happened. I still have no idea what's going on. I really want to help you, but I'll need more details. Who was there? Where did it happen? Does he have a police record? No, my Jamil is a good boy. But those good for nothing thugs he's been hanging out with lately, may God take them, are nothing but trouble. If this is his ﬁrst time, and he was caught with a small amount, and has no previous record, they'll close the case with a warning. Don't worry, it'll be okay. Hanan, you didn't drink anything, how about some coffee? Layla, can you make us coffee? My pleasure. Do you drink your coffee with no sugar, like Ziad? A bit of sugar. Are you going to keep that sour face all day? Just because I met your sister. Layla, maybe you should quit smoking, what do you think? Where did that come from? Why, do you want to quit too? Maybe. What else? Should I stop getting high? Or dressing like this? What exactly is on the list? Enough, Layla. You know what I'm talking about. Did you have to smoke in front of her? Couldn't you restrain yourself? Restrain myself?! What do you mean by that? You're talking about a cigarette... Are you for real?! Your nephew was arrested yesterday and you're talking about a cigarette? Don't play stupid. You know exactly what I'm saying. Okay, so if I have to give up smoking, and dressing as I do, not to mention partying at night, what are you planning to give up, Ziad? Where do you think we're living, in Europe? Taybeh isn't Europe, baby. As the saying goes: "Dress as people want, but eat what you want. " This is our reality, that's that. So what happens if I eat what I want, and dress as I want? Too much for you? You want to change the world in one day? I got news for you, don't count on it. It won't happen, it's a waste of time. Ziad... I have only one thing to tell you. I won't change my choices in life. Either you accept me as I am or... It's over. Welcome to Tarshiha village! This is my high school. Do you see the lemon tree? - Yeah. My ﬁrst kiss, right there. Fuck, that was a long time ago. With a girl? Respect! - Are you kidding?! It was with a boy a year older, I wanted to kiss like in the movies. Poor thing, he was in love. Crazy girl. Salma? Hello, Umm Jiries. How are you? - I'm ﬁne, and you? I'm ﬁne. We miss you around here. Hi, Mom. - Welcome. What took you so long? I missed you, what a nice dress. - I wore it especially for you. Hello, I'm Dunya. - Nice to meet you. She didn't mention you were coming. May I use your bathroom? - Go ahead. You didn't tell me that you're bringing guests. Does she know what's happening tonight? Mom, it's just a dinner. Just a dinner... Uncle, I'm thinking of moving up the wedding date. And what does Nour say? - Nour doesn't want to. Hurry up girls, the men must be hungry after the Friday prayers. Abu Mahmoud, the food is ready, come to the table. Call Abu Khalil in Haifa, and he'll come. Yes, talk to him... - Okay, let's go eat. Please, go ahead. - No, after you. The Sheikh's sermon was excellent today. - Yes, he is a respectable Sheikh. I also liked him, to be honest. How are you? Praise be to God. Bless your hands for the food, Umm Mahmoud. Bon appetite. God bless your hands, Auntie! Wissam, how are things at the charitable society? I'm sure there's plenty of work. What can I say, Abu Mahmoud, People are barely getting by, the economic situation is bad. The list of people in need just keeps growing. May God empower us to do good, Inshallah. You didn't tell me, how's the house construction going? It's going exactly as planned, praise be to God. Hopefully in two months, Nour and I will... choose our furniture. Nour, darling, don't scrimp and save. Choose the most expensive! Abu Wissam has stacks of cash hidden in the ﬂoorboards. Floorboards! You mean he needs an entire bank to manage his accounts. Believe me father, some people live in palaces, but God knows what their life is like inside. It's a pleasure to have you, Umm Elias! Thank you! - What an honor! - Likewise. Do you like the food, Umm Elias? Delicious! Bless you, what a cook! Elias, dear, your mother tells me you're an engineer, is that right? A mechanical engineer at Delta Carmiel. Elias, may Christ bless him, has never lived away from home. Even after he was offered a job in Haifa, with free housing! Ask me why. Why? Because family is above all. When you have a family like ours, why move out? Darling, your mother tells me that you're a music teacher. Yes, a music teacher. A teacher would be the best thing for my son. I always wanted a bride with a good job. What's better than a teacher? You come home at 2pm, and still have enough time to cook for the husband and kids, before they return. That's the best. Dunya, where did you say you're from, Haifa, right? What do you do, are you a teacher like Salma? No, not a teacher. I'm a doctor. And Salma's neighbor. A doctor in Tel-Aviv?! Are there no hospitals in Haifa, that you have to go all the way there? I'm doing my residency at Ichilov Hospital. Bless you. - Bless her. - Ichilov is an excellent hospital. It's one of the best in the country. If only the hospitals in the north were as good. Welcome, welcome! To you, Abu Elias! To everyone, again. To everyone, to the bachelors and bachelorettes! Welcome to our home, and hopefully to our family! Cheers. - Cheers! - Welcome! So, Umm George, don't we deserve a nice cup of your homemade coffee? Of course you do! The best coffee. Salma will get the dessert. Umm George, I can't have you making the coffee while I'm here, let me make it. That's nice of you, go ahead! To be honest, the groom's curls are prettier than mine. Lucky guy, did you like him? - Jealous? Want him for yourself? Delta Carmiel, he says. - Quiet, they'll hear us. Don't play with ﬁre. I have to change this radio. I see you changed the way you cover your hair. I like it this way. I like it too. The important thing is, what do you think about moving up the wedding? No. - Why not? Because I don't love you. Did you see his mother's tits? They're as big as the groom's head. - Have mercy. George couldn't take his eyes off them. - Your brother embarrassed us. That poor cross was stuck there, couldn't get out. You're crazy. Salma! Stand up so I can see you! Dunya, pack your things and go catch the bus. Don't let me hear that you talked to Salma, or even called her. Because if you do, you will pay for it. Go! But Mom, you know I have to go with her. You stay here, your father wants to talk to you. You, come with me! Sit down. Can you explain to me exactly what it is your mother told me? Speak! I said, speak! If this is what she does at home, what the hell does she do outside?! Until you decide whether you want to marry or not, and move to your husband's house, you will bury yourself here at home. No coming, no going. I hope your mother is mistaken. Otherwise, I have no problem sending you to the madhouse! Where you will rot, until you're cured of your illness. You would explain to me why this guy's no good or that guy's no good. And I would agree with you and be proud of you. From this day forward, I decide when, how and what happens! And who you will marry! Get out of my sight, I can't stand to see your face! Go to your room! Go! I don't understand how this could happen to us. You think I do? If only you'd listened to me, this wouldn't have happened! This is the last thing I need before the municipal elections! Rumors that I have a lesbian daughter... Shhh! Someone might hear you... George, don't lock the door. - Are you leaving? My love. Dunya, I'm gonna move to Berlin. What? What will you do there? I know what I need to do tomorrow. Aside from one meeting, I'm free all day if you want. As-salaamu alaykum. - Wa alaykum as-salaam, come in. You're going to let these sluts play with your head? You really think you can gang up with them against me? Why? Have you lost your mind? We're about to get married. From now on, you only talk to me, you hear? Leave Nour alone! - Who do you think you are, lying whore?! Maybe I'm a liar and a whore. But you're a rapist. One wrong move and you'll have to answer to those guys over there. Nour, don't let them make you do things you'll regret. It's me, Wissam. What happened is in the past. There is a solution for everything. Sweetie, you don't have to respond. No, I want to. Wissam, it's over. What do you want... What will you tell the family? They won't believe you, my reputation is golden. I say, let's forget the past and start over. And these two will be judged by God. Just so you know, there's a video too. Is this what you want? Nour... Enough! You're coming with me to tell my father that the wedding is cancelled. As-salaamu alaykum, Abu Mahmoud. Peace and God's mercy and blessings upon you. Hello, son, how are you? Hello my Nour. What's wrong? What's going on? Abu Mahmoud... Abu Mahmoud... Spit it out, man, what's wrong?! It's not working out. Nour has changed a lot. I don't recognize her anymore. Changed how? What do you mean? Nour, what's going on my dear? Some things are best kept in the heart, father. Listen, I will beg nobody to marry my daughter. Changed? It is you who has changed. I don't see that anything about her has changed. Nothing! That's enough! Go on then! A guy like that doesn't deserve a single tear of yours. I love you. Tonight, Layla, Almush will ﬁre up your party. I'm getting the stuff this time, I'm not leaving it to you like last time. Look who's here, the bastard. Hey roomie! Take a seat. You working around here? - Yeah, in the area. How are you, Layla? All good? Good. What's up, Layla? How are you? What do you want, Ziad? What is it my love? What's wrong with you? What happened? Weren't we happy together? What happened? Are you here to propose and introduce me to your parents? Uhh... Uhh, what? I thought that maybe you... Know what, Ziad? I'll answer for you. The answer is no. You'll never marry me, know why? Let me tell you... Ziad, you're just like the rest. You're living a lie. Liberal my ass. Would you let me walk with your sisters? Answer! Would you introduce me to your family? No! What exactly do you want then? Tell me. Pathetic. I'm pathetic? Ziad, get the fuck out of my car. Get out, I never want to see you again. Ziad, get out of the car! Get the fuck out! I love you. Me too. I'll miss you. Ready for the carouse tonight? What does carouse mean? It means we're gonna have fun. Just say we'll have fun then.
