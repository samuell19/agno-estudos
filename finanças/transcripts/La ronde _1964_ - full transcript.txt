IN A FILM BY ROGER VADIM CIRCLE OF LOVE BASED ON A PLAY BY ARTHUR SCHNITZLER -Interested? -No, it's too late. We're on call in five minutes. Damn boot-lickers! When are you two enlisting? Go on, then, you patriots! -Those kinds of women are so rude. -Come on, forget her. Georges! Hey, Georges! Hey! Are you blind?! You're not Georges! I almost got run over. Couldn't you tell me it wasn't you? -"Wasn't me" what? -Georges! My name is Georges! You're not the only one called Georges! I thought you were a guy from Ploubalec. Where's Ploubalec? In Finistère. That's where I come from. Well, shit! You think I look like I come from Ploubalec? What did you want with your Georges? I knew him there, before I moved to Paris. -You been in Paris long? -A year. -And a hooker? -Also a year. -You look so much like him. -Enough, already! Maybe he looks like me! See ya. Come to my place! It's nicer than the barracks. Sure, but we're on duty in five minutes. -I have no money. Bye. -Come on! It'll cost you nothing since you look like Georges. Hey, you're the girl Buzard told me about! Who's Buzard? I don't know him. Yes, it must be you. Don't you hang around the Omnibus Terrace? Sometimes. So what? Well, it's a girl at the Omnibus Café. Buzard had an accident, she brought him to his place. She didn't want to charge him, even though Buzard sure is ugly. He's told me about it, he couldn't believe it. You know… I've brought lots back from Omnibus. I can't remember them all. But if Buzard's ugly, then it wasn't me. Or at least, it's not him. -Well? Shall we? -Hey… you're in quite a hurry, now you know it's free. I'm on duty in five minutes, so save the pleasantries. -Where do you crash? -Ten minutes from here. Are you kidding me? That's too far away! I like you, but… I'll lose my day off on Saturday if I mess around. Come on Saturday, then! Okay? It'll still be free! Alright, fine. Give me your address, quick! -You won't come… -Yes, I will. -God, you're pathetic. And clingy too! -You bastard. You know full well you're good-looking. Come on, just for a minute! Let's go over the city walls, if my place is too far. -Nature isn't really my thing. -Come on, I know a nice spot. Come on. Grass does smell nice, really. I'd like a lover like you. I'd make you too jealous. I always need change. I could change your mind. Georges was the biggest womanizer when he met me at my parents' farm. We liked each other, so he didn't sleep with another girl for three months. I gotta say… liking someone like that, it's really something! It's almost as beautiful as the feeling itself. Shit! I missed it! You'll have to send me a copy of your love story. My Saturday's ruined. Say thank you, at least! Alright, already. Let me enjoy myself. Listen! One buck's a lot, but at least give me ten cents! Ten cents?! Did you get a good look at me? Give me a cigarette, then. Do you think I'm an idiot? Messing up my Saturday isn't enough for you? Fine, then! Leave, you cheapskate! Bastard! Lowlife! Isn't the French army wonderful? If that's how they hope to clean off the French flag… He can stick it where the sun don't shine! Mr. Fancy Déroulède! Well, then… Sneaking out, are we, lad? That'll be 15 days! With our old friend Bidasse, We're never far apart, we'll always be Two boys born in Arras, Capital of Pas-de-Calais. And later on in life, We'll often say, true to our regiment, We've had lots of orgies, We sure had lots of fun, hon! Watch out, time for the third round! I'll try again. Bravo! He's KO. -You're so strong. -Well, I am in the Dragoons. -Want to dance? -Yes. -Do you come here often? -No, it's my first time. I usually go to Wagram, that's my neighbourhood. I'm meeting a friend who does come here often. -It's lucky we met, then. -Really? The chiefs made me skip my day off at the barracks. How did you get out, then? What are walls for? That's why we built them! As support! Gosh, I'd never dare! What if you bump into the sergeant? There's no way! I sure am lucky. Something told me I absolutely had to come here tonight. -Really? -I knew I'd meet you. You know, fate! I'm a true romantic. Are you? Hey, there's my friend! You don't say! Let's wave to her. Hello. Hello. I'm an old friend of… your friend. What's your name again? -Germaine. -I'm an old friend of Germaine. And the friends of friends… are all friends. -What's your name? -Rose. That's an interesting name. Could I get you a beer? Come on. My goodness! The bosses had a diner tonight. The pile of dirty dishes took forever. Luckily, the cook let me leave. Well, honey, do you want that beer? What about me? You too, of course. What do you think I am? An oaf? I swear, women are always so suspicious! Come this way, Miss Rose. There's a good table there. Let's go see our old love nest together again. Waiter! Those long-gone days you spent kneeling before me, Perhaps you still remember them today. Waiter, three beers. How we loved each other! I'll have a shandy instead. From January until the end of December. No one will know how happy we were, So close to the heavens, in our sweet, little room. Are you a romantic, Miss Rose? It's crazy how much of a romantic I am. But how far away the sweet dream of my youth now seems so far away. How we loved each other, the two of us, as soon as the sun would allow us. To show how happy we were, on Sundays, we'd embrace by the window. How we'll love each other, the two of us, We'll replace love with tenderness. And we'll see that sweet dream once again She just doesn't stop, does she? -We should dance. -Do you really like dancing so much? With you, yes. How fun! A Staccato polka! Shall we? -Would you like to dance, Miss? -Yes. We're outside! I didn't know where I was anymore. Oh, yes. The fresh air feels good. I love dancing so much, I never want to stop! No other girl in the whole ball was as cute as you. -And you've tried them all? -Well, you can tell just by dancing. Hey, there! You're bold, aren't you? Careful, you'll rip my buttons off! You should be more formal with me! -Really? -We don't know each other well enough. Exactly, let's get better acquainted. What do you think we're doing now? Don't treat me so informally, we've just met. Shit! We haven't just met, we've danced three times. No! No, Mr. Georges! It's too fast. Do behave. After all, someone might see us. Come look over there, it's fun. There's an abandoned house there. But… Mr. Georges! What are you doing? Let's go back to the crowd. -Why would we go back to the crowd? -No! Mr. Georges! If I'd known… Oh, my! You're so soft! Like butter! I can't see your face. What about my face? Well, honey? You're not staying here all night, are you? Help me up. Alright. Oh, Georges… What was Georges up to? You're a dirty boy, aren't you? -You'll make me suffer? -Sure will. -Give it time. -Oh, come on… Be nice, come on… I am nice. I can smoke, can't I? It won't ruin the feeling. Just hold me tight. Like you did earlier. It's so dark now. Let's head back there, it'll be brighter. You don't want to be in the dark anymore, do you? At least tell me you love me… You should say that to girls. -Didn't I prove that already? -Yes. But you should say it too. I swear, women are so complicated! Listen! Hurry, they're playing the 'Polka des Mirettes'! You don't want to kiss me again? The lights will be too bright in there. Fine. There. Come on, let's go dance! You still feel like dancing? Sure do, that's why I sneaked out! I should go home. My boss is a real cow. She won't let me stay out after 11 o'clock. So… I was thinking you could take me home. -Take you home? -Well, yes. Going home alone is sad. Where do your dumb bosses live? -Near Les Invalides. -That's fine, it's on my way. But my curfew's at midnight. And your friend's waiting for us. Why? It's her turn now? Well, we have to be polite. I did invite her, didn't I? Shit! Happy now? We missed the 'Polka des Mirettes'! Women, honestly… Great! They're playing it again! Hey, there's Miss Germaine. I'll have this dance. May I cut in? If you want me to take you home, wait for me. Okay, I'll wait. Go get yourself a beer. Women, honestly! I'm sure you're not like that, Miss Germaine. Would you like to dance, Miss? No, thank you. I don't want to dance any more tonight. 'My darling, today is Sunday.' 'I'm sure you're having fun right now.' 'I'm all alone. The cook is out for the day, and the bosses have left to the countryside.' 'Here, there's only the owner's son, who's preparing for an exam.' It's so sad, in this nice weather. 'It's so sad… 'in this nice… weather.' Come in. Mr. Alfred rang for me? Oh, yes… Yes, Rose, I did ring. What did I…? Could you close the shutters? Yes… it's cooler in here when the shutters are closed. Yes, Mr. Alfred. Mr. Alfred rang for me? Yes… Rose… Is there any cognac in the house? Certainly, Mr. Alfred. But it must probably be locked away. Yes, that's true, it's Sunday today. I'm a bit lost. Mr. Alfred works too hard. Mr. Alfred should rest for a little. Rose, bring me a glass of water. Yes, Mr. Alfred. Thank you, Rose. Let the water run, so it's nice and cool. Give it here. Excuse me. I'm exhausted. What time is it, Rose? It's almost four o'clock, Mr. Alfred. Four o'clock? Thank you, Rose. Here. Yes, Mr. Alfred? Rose, I just thought of this now, but it's quite important. -The Professor isn't here yet. -I'd have heard the doorbell. That's surprising, he's usually early. Unless he rang while Mr. Alfred was ringing. Rose, come here. Yes, Mr. Alfred? No, closer. Yes, closer. There, that's good. Well, I was thinking… What about, Mr. Alfred? About your blouse. It's black, isn't it? It's black. It's a… very pretty black colour. -In winter, it's blue. -But we're in summer! So, it's black. It gets very hot in summer… These are little buttons, aren't they? Yes, Mr. Alfred. They're tiny, little buttons. But… we shouldn't undo them, Mr. Alfred. But why not? Tiny buttons… Buttons are dumb, aren't they? Mr. Alfred! Your skin is so white, Rose. Mr. Alfred is truly flattering me. But now, I should button up my blouse. No, not right away! That would be so sad! No, don't do that! Do you have a lover, Rose? A lover who would…? No, Mr. Alfred. Why do you tell me this with such a sigh? That's not normal. You're so pretty… It makes me sick! Such pretty little shoes! -Your tights, they're black. -Mr. Alfred! What if someone rings? I don't care! I couldn't care less! -Who would ring at this time? -Mr. Alfred's Professor. The Professor? For what he teaches me… You know, administrative law isn't very useful in life. But your legs… Oh, your legs! I've been watching you for a long time… Rose. You never noticed? Yes. Sometimes, when you serve us, you lean over while changing plates. Your stomach brushes against my back. Did you know? In fact, I'd always lean back as far as I could. Have you ever noticed? I didn't know what I was doing. And one day, I replied, "Yes, Miss" to Mr. Poincaré, whom father had invited to dinner. The looks on Father and Grandfather's faces! I couldn't control my movements anymore. I'd eat with whatever I had at hand. And one day, I was eating my soup with a fish fork! Did you notice that? Yes, Mr. Alfred! We laughed so hard in the pantry! Your teeth! Rose, when you laugh… Those teeth! They're just like everyone else's, Mr. Alfred! No, not like everyone else's! Sit down, so I can see them better. -I'm falling! -"I'm falling!" It's so dumb to sit down. It's such a ridiculous position. At a right angle. It's so artificial. Here, stretch yourself out. -It'll be more natural. -No! -No, Mr. Alfred. -Yes. I never would have guessed you'd be such a naughty boy. No, it's too bright here, Mr. Alfred. No, it's all in your head. It's almost dark out. You know, I've watched you… There's a small window above the door to your room. I looked in while you were washing once. Mr. Alfred… How naughty. Don't say that, it was beautiful. Mr. Alfred! What if someone rang the bell? We wouldn't open, that's all. In front of your Father? -Father?! -There… Oh, Rose… Mr. Alfred… It's not just that. Do you love me a little, at least? It's the Professor. I can't go downstairs to open the door in this state. He'll go do administrative law elsewhere. I was perhaps a bit… a bit… No, Mr. Alfred. What you said wasn't true, was it? You've had a lover before. Yes, Mr. Alfred. -Don't worry. -I thought as much. Naturally, we'll have to be very careful about my mother. From now on, I promise I'll never be alone with you so this never happens again. We let ourselves get carried away, you know… I'm very sorry. Rose… You're so charming and… such a great girl. But this should stay between us. For your sake, and for mine. Of course, Mr. Alfred. 'I'm thinking… of you.' 'Are you faithful to me?' 'Sophie! Sophie!' 'You must accept to see me alone!' Sophie, my dear. No, not right away. That's too much. Sophie, I knew you'd-- No… I was so worried-- Sorry, Father! -Do you need anything? -No, thank you, ma'am. Sometimes, when we move in… But… I'm at your disposal. You're very kind, ma'am, thank you. But I have everything here. I'm very subtle! But if I can be of any use at all… No use, thank you. Old hag! With rooms at this price, she should get lost. No, no! -No, it's for me. -Oh? Sophie! Oh, Alfred, I'm absolutely terrified! -I'm… I'm going to faint! -No, not here. In my room! Come and faint in my room. But where are you taking me, Alfred? Do sit down, Sophie. Sit down. Thank you. Oh, Alfred… Alfred, let me leave, I'm begging you. Where am I? My place. Have you been living here for long? No, not very long. Wouldn't you like to remove your hat? What's gotten into you, Alfred? I said I would only stay for five minutes. At least remove your veil. I'm wearing two! Remove both, then. I have the right to see you, don't I? Do I mean so much to you, Alfred? But it's so warm in here! It's summer. I should leave… -I should leave. -Remove your hat. I should leave. Alfred, I should leave. Just put the pins on the chimney. Otherwise, we never find them again. What's the matter, Alfred? Did you prick yourself? No… No, Sophie… You've never looked so beautiful! Alfred, you promised you'd behave. -It's so warm in this room. -Remove your gloves! Oh, yes, my gloves… Put them next to the hat. And now, farewell, Alfred. -I'll leave now. -No, Sophie. Oh, Alfred… What have you done to me? I wrote you a such long letter… I didn't receive it. Well, I didn't send it. In it, I told you I wouldn't come. I don't understand this, Alfred. I have a husband, a little girl… Alfred… This is awful, we're like star-crossed lovers. That's right, isn't it? Star-crossed lovers? I don't know. -Give me another kiss. -No! One last one, then. No! Not on the mouth. Alfred, if you love me, you should let me leave. Oh, my hat! There's another room next door? Yes, a bit. What do you mean, "a bit"? -Well, I meant-- -What's in that room, Alfred? A sort of salon… Do you host often? No, no one. -It's just in case-- -Alfred, swear something to me. I swear! No, it's nothing. Give me a glass of water, and I'll leave. And let the water run, so it's nice and cool. Shit, there's no water. Wouldn't you prefer a bit of port wine? Just a drop, then. A glass to say farewell. I'll go get a corkscrew. No corkscrew, of course! Shit, shit, shit! What are you saying to yourself, Alfred? That I'm miserable! Life is too hard! It's a desert where you never meet anyone or find anything! Shit, shit, shit! Shit! Alfred, what did you do? An unfortunate gesture. I don't know what I'm doing. Life is short, Sophie! Alfred, that's not a reason! You'll ruin my hairstyle. Alfred, my sister's waiting for me. She has a fever. I have a fever too! The one and only… true fever! -Alfred! -The one you only get once! Alfred, you promised me you'd behave. And I believed you. It's so bright in here, Alfred. What are you doing, Alfred? Where are you taking me? It's darker in the next room, my love. In the other salon? It's a bedroom, Sophie. A bedroom… Alfred, had I known… Alfred, what are you doing with me? Alfred! Alfred, you told me this was a salon! You're very naughty, Alfred! No! Not on the bed! Not on the bed… Alfred, we've only ever seen each other at mass. or at the Palais de Glace. Come quick, Alfred! I'm cold! -Do you have your watch? -Coming, my love! I must love you too much… Yes, that's it. I must love you too much. I was mad. I was already half-mad for several days. I had a… certain feeling. Don't torment yourself, my dear. You're so nervous. Calm down. It's understandable, really. Sure. Have you ever read Stendhal? -Stendhal? -Yes. The psychology of love. It's a book Stendhal wrote. No… But why do you ask me that? In that book, Stendhal tells a very significant story. Really? What story is that, darling? It's the story of cavalry officers who reunite. And? So, these cavalry officers… tell of their romantic adventures. Each one explains how they felt with the woman they loved the most. And they all admit… that with that woman, precisely, they experienced the same thing that's happened to me today. -Really? -Yes! It seems to be classic. But either way, darling, you promised me you'd behave. Come on, don't try to be witty. I'm not being witty. I actually find Stendhal's story very instructive. Until now, I only thought it would be older people or people who pushed their luck too far who… But it has nothing to do with it! It's about the intensity of your feelings. No, what's most beautiful about Stendhal's story is what one of the cavalry officers says at the end of the story. He says that he spent six nights… Or maybe three, I can't remember. With a young woman he'd been desiring for weeks. And on each of those nights, the two of them were together, crying tears of joy. -Together? -Yes, together. It's beautiful, isn't it? Yes, very. But some people don't really cry, don't you think? Yes, but this is a special case. It was a special kind of love. Oh, right! I understood that Stendhal was saying that all cavalry officers, in those circumstances-- Sure, go ahead, make fun of it! That's obviously easier than trying to understand. I'm not even thinking about it anymore. You should stop thinking about it too, my darling. You're not about to start crying, are you? See? You're doing it again! No, darling… I'm so happy. Do you remember our first conversation? You said to me… You said we'd be angels. Well, we are angels. -What time is it? -I don't know. Your skin is so soft. Oh, no… Oh, no, Alfred. It's so late now. My sister is sick. I promised I'd go see her. Angels… We were meant to be angels. Still reading? You'll hurt your eyes. -Did you finish the newspaper? -No, but there's nothing of interest. It seems we're living in a time that has no stories to tell. The year 1914 will be a year when nothing happened. We should get to sleep, darling. What are you reading? Just a fairy tale… Nothing happens in it either. You're so charming. You have some sort of special glow tonight. Tonight? Yes. Do you know I'm still in love with you? Sometimes, I think I forget that. Sometimes, we should forget it. Why is that? Because if we were still in love with each other… marriage would be an imperfect thing. If over five years of being married, we never once forgot that we're in love, then we'd no longer be in love. -Why? -I'm certain of it. Marriage isn't an affair. You need to have a plan for the future. So, in summary, you've preserved your love in jars and every once in a while, you open a jar. Well, what I meant is a lot more poetic than that, but it's something like that. You're charming! And the way you express yourself is so childish. You really are adorable tonight. I don't know why. Me neither, darling. But since you find me quite adorable tonight, I take it you've decided to open up a jar? My God, you're so funny! You truly are the most delicious being I've ever known. Come closer. Put your head on my shoulder. Let me make this clear, marriage is a sacred thing. We, men, sometimes forget its meaning… because of the romantic adventures we've had before we met. Because, in the end, what creatures have we dealt with before? Yes, what creatures would that be? I've often wondered myself. Some pitiful creatures, believe me. But we shouldn't judge them for it. They do still have their uses. You don't know the misery that forces these miserable women to sin. But do they always give away their bodies for money? No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm not just talking about the material kind of misery. There's also the kind… How should I explain? A moral kind of misery. It's a notion, which is somewhat incomplete, of what's good and bad. That's it. But sometimes, I see them in the street or in restaurants. They don't seem so miserable to me, they're always laughing. But laughing how? Never forget, my child, that these creatures are destined by nature to fall further and further. There is no limit to their fall. But maybe it's pleasant to feel yourself falling, like when we dream. Sophie! How can you say that? Tell me more. Tell me more. I like it when you tell me about it. About what? About the creatures, the women who sin. What's gotten into you, Sophie? You promised me when we first got married that you… you… you'd tell me one day about what you did in your youth. You're interested? Aren't you my husband? Isn't it fair that I should know everything about you? Well, the youth of a young man… That should be forgotten, my child. It would be like desecration. No, no, we won't desecrate anything. Tell me, Henri, how many women have you held in your arms the way you're holding me now? But Sophie… it's embarrassing. I don't know. But Henri, you promised me! You shouldn't ask me questions like that. It really is in bad taste! Well, you… Such a pure, well-behaved young woman. Yes, I'm well-behaved out in public. But we're here alone together, in bed! But it's our marriage bed. I really want to know. But Sophie, I'm not going to describe to you… You're my wife! Remember our little girl is sleeping in the next room! And I'd like to have a little boy too. Go on! Tell me about the other girls! There-- No… Was there a married woman among them? Why do you ask? Just to know! There must surely be married women like that. I know there are, but I'd like to hear it from someone who's met one. Sophie, you don't know a woman like that, do you? A married woman who… No, darling, it's just that… it intrigues me. My child. You can't understand how these miserable women feel. They're caught in a net of lies, secrecy, betrayal, and danger! -Of course. -They pay a high price for feeble joy. They pay a high price for so little… Um… Pleasure? What do you mean, "pleasure"? How can you call that pleasure? But they surely must feel a bit of pleasure. Otherwise, they wouldn't do it! It's just a short moment of exhilaration. Yes… Exhilaration… It's sickening, of course. But admit that you've had one experience like that before, among all your other relationships. Alright, fine. Yes, I did. But it was my saddest experience of all. Who was it? -Tell me who it is. Do I know her? -What's gotten into you? Henri, was this… Was this a long time ago? Long before our wedding? Don't ask me anymore. I beg you, no more. -Did you really love her? -Don't talk about that, I beg you. I've only ever loved one woman: you. One can only love purity and honesty, isn't that right? Anyway, she's dead. -Really? -Yes. It's a dumb thing to say, but I think those women die young. You think so? -What? -Henri! Pleasure is dangerous! And if we love our husbands so much, like this, would we die too? My child… My sweet, innocent, little child. You're so cute! You're so tiny! So fresh and lovely! No, darling. We won't die? You're sure? On the contrary! In a marriage, it's very healthy! Henri! If you were always… in love like this… And what would happen, if I were always…? It would mean I'd know you love me. We can't always be lovers in a marriage. Why not? You're not just a woman I'm attracted to, you're my wife socially as well. And I wouldn't want my wife to… Even with me… Yes, even with me. You see, earlier, you said the word "pleasure." Well, that's something else. You think so? It's a completely secondary thing. It touches a part of us which isn't… I mean… which is less… to which we shouldn't concede… How should I explain this? Life is a serious thing, my child. And pleasure is just the dessert. Oh, it's quite late. I like dessert. You're served in other salons before, you think you know your job. But no, you don't know it yet. You must still learn the most difficult part for young servers: servicing private lounges. What is a private lounge? It's a room, where someone who doesn't wish to be recognised or disturbed can invite one or a few friends. I said, "recognised or disturbed"! The service staff must not recognise anyone. In a first-class establishment, the staff mustn't recognise clients. What's the matter? You'll speak up later. The private client, whether they are with friends… or, and let's not be hypocritical, they are alone… with a woman… wishes above all not to be disturbed. However, the client must eat. That's what they're here for. Apparently… So they can eat, we must enter the room to bring dishes. Right there! That's when psychology comes into play-- Be quiet! You'll speak later! Here's a general rule: as soon as they ring, go for it! You might say, "They finished the starter half an hour ago. What are they up to?" The answer is… It's none of your business! They can do as they please! But as soon as they ring, hop to it! Why do you keep interrupting? Room 12 has been ringing non-stop for five minutes, Mr. Albert! -You should have said, imbecile! -You didn't let me speak. I'm so sorry, Sir. I've been working here for 30 years, and there's an exception to the rule, a totally unique situation. They rang the bell, but we shouldn't go in. Sir was sitting right on the bell. Your lips taste like whipped cream. My lips are always very soft. -You've been told that before? -What are you imagining? How many have kissed you on the lips? First of all, I haven't counted. And second, why do you ask? -If I tell you, you won't believe me. -Why not? Fine, then. Guess. Well, I don't know. I don't want to upset you. Let's see. Twenty? Why not one hundred? -Who do you take me for? -Right, you're still very young. Ten? Well, obviously, a girl you meet in the street who follows you to a private lounge, must be capable of many horrors. You've been in a private lounge before? -You want to hear the truth? -Yes! -Yes. -Yes? Yes. But not in the way you're thinking. It was with a friend and her fiancé on Mardi Gras Day. That's it. Right… Well, it wouldn't be dramatic if you and your lover-- No, it wouldn't be dramatic. But I don't have a lover. What? You don't expect me to believe that you… No. Well… -I haven't had one in six months. -I see. -Who was it? -A man. You're making fun of me. Was he your first? Yes. And let me tell you… He looked like you. And if you're wondering, that's why I followed you so eagerly. He had a look… That man could do whatever he wanted with me. -And you left him. -No. He went back to his country. He was a foreigner. -More champagne? -No, I should go. -I'll get an earful from my mother. -You live with her? Of course I live with my mother, what do you expect? And… your father? He died a long time ago. And at your mother's, do you live alone with her? Are you kidding? There are five of us: two boys and two other girls. Here, come and sit with me. Sit down. -Are you the eldest? -No, I'm the second. My sister, Léonie, works at a florist shop. -What do you do? -Well, I'm just at home. I see. Someone has to be home to look after the children. My mother works too. What do you tell her when you come home late? I always find something. -What will you say tonight? -That I was at the theatre. -You get theatre tickets often? -My brother's a hair stylist. -His client is Mrs. Réjane. -That's a very important job! Don't ruin my hairstyle. -What does your other brother do? -He goes to school. He wants to be a schoolteacher. -But why all the questions? -Because I'm interested. -You have another younger sister? -Yes, she's still a little girl. But I need to keep an eye on her! They lose all their innocence at school! She's 12 years old, barely. Well, you might not believe me, the other day, I caught her with a boy. -Can you believe that? -Twelve years old… Oh! "Oh!" is right! That's terrible. They're not children anymore. You poor thing. Here, have some champagne. Here. And you? How old are you? I'm 19 years old. My little sweetheart. My little sweetheart. My little child. It's wonderful! I've just understood how wonderful it is! -What's wonderful? -You! You, you, you! You didn't even tell me your name. André. -Shit! -What is it? -That's… my uncle's name! -Really? Well? What's the matter now, you poor thing? I'm looking for my pearls. You broke my necklace. And to think that after 30 years of working here, I still wonder if I should go in… when they ring the bell. What's the matter, my friend? Playing hide and seek? Bring me the bill, please. Do you know what time it is? No, but you're about to tell me. It's eleven thirty. Really? Well, I don't care. -And your mother? -Why? What do you want with her? Nothing. You were lying to me earlier, weren't you? -She's used to seeing you come home late. -I'll say I was at the theatre. What if she asks about the play? You mustn't be a very good liar. I could give you lessons, to lie to your wife. -My… my wife? -You're not married? -You surely are! -What makes you think that? Just a feeling. I'd like to know. I'm not wearing a wedding ring. Liar! It's in your vest pocket! You always check you haven't lost it. Would it bother you if I were married? I would have preferred it if you were single. But, you know… life doesn't care about what we'd have preferred. But either way, you wouldn't have married me. Do you have any regrets, when you think of my wife? You know, your wife must be doing the same as you. I forbid you from saying such a thing! -Some things just shouldn't be said-- -Ah! See? You are married! Listen, I like you. I like you so much. -Really? -Oh, yes! I want to see you again. Often! -What about me? -What about you? Would I want to? Wait… let me ponder it over. Yes… I think I like you a bit. But you must understand, for that… I must make things clear with you. I don't just mean from a moral point of view. I mean… Well… you understand. In my situation, both professional and private, I would never have time to keep an eye on you. And I know some men who, simply to have some fun, would be capable one evening… -In a private lounge. -Yes, a private lounge or… Don't interrupt me, please, and try to understand. First of all, the first rule. It's very simple. Never respond if a man stops you in the street. Just keep walking. If they insist, just walk faster. Above all, never ever stop in front of a shop window. They'll walk up to you for a chat. That's all they're waiting for, to start a conversation. Even with a simple reply, they think they're entitled to anything. And if, God forbid, it's raining… he makes the most of your distress to offer his umbrella to his car. Naturally, you should refuse. Go on and ruin your outfit, my dear, without hesitation. You know I'll buy you another. But whatever you do, don't accept to take his arm! Oh, woman, always searching For new conquests, day and night, To please them, in vanity, You spend hours in front of your mirror Elegance, a mischievous grace A look, and a respectable sigh Velvets, perfumes, and crinoline Nothing beats a 'je-ne-sais-quoi' Ms. Arthur is a woman Of which others talked about for long No newspapers, nothing, no publicity, She had a throng of lovers Ms. Arthur is a woman of which others talked about for long. Now, I'll sing 'The Carriage' by Xanroff. This woman has incredible talent. -I enjoy applauding her. -"Ca, ca, hop, whoops-a-daisy!" I enjoy it too, it means your hands are busy! -My God, you are funny! -"Ca, ca, hop, whoops-a-daisy!" Do you know how rare it is to find a girl as funny as you in the street? I tell myself the same thing. "Ca, ca, hop, whoops-a-daisy!" -Do you know what we should do? -No, but you're about to tell me. Instead of listening to 'The Carriage', which isn't a song for young girls, we should get into my automobile… and have a drink at my place. Eh? Just for a minute. No way, an automobile? You really a true original! It's a De Dion car. -Forty horsepower. -You can fit that many horses in it? From the carriage, a woman comes out and says, "Ca, ca, hop, whoops-a-daisy!" From the carriage, a woman says, "Great, Léon! It's my husband!" "We no longer need to hide! Ca, ca, hop, whoops-a-daisy!" "We no longer need to hide! Let's give the driver 100 cents!" Wonderful! You're simply wonderful! You're Paris! You're the city of Paris itself! That's not good, I'm from Argenteuil! It doesn't matter, you're still Paris to me. You've got lots of clutter at your place. Who cleans up around here? I have a Chinese valet. They have a very unusual way of tidying things up. He simply moves the objects around. He's satisfied with making a new mess elsewhere. -This is all of China. -Can't see much in here, can we? I only work in half-darkness. But these adorable eyes will get used to it soon. These adorable eyes won't have the time. -Why? -I'm only here for a minute. That's what we agreed, isn't it? -Remove your hat, my dear. -For one minute? There you go. You should rest for a while. But I'm not tired, we came here by car. But you're so uncomfortable in that Egyptian chair. It must have been nice in the Ramses II's era, but since then, our behinds have something else in mind. Come over here, my darling. What a coincidence: a couch! How curious! Women sometimes offer you a seat on chairs, but with men, it's always a couch. What are you saying? This is just a simple sofa. Here. -Put your head on the arm rest. -But I'm not tired at all! Yes, you are! At your age, you must look after yourself. I bet you're not even twenty. -I'm nineteen. -Nineteen! Nineteen is a critical age! Now, go on, lie down. How adorable! She's simply adorable! I'm going to do something with this little creature. Get it out of its shell, smooth it down, transform it… Pygmalion! You hear me? Pygmalion! I want to be your Pygmalion! Do you get a bit loony sometimes? "Loony?" Loony, loony, loony! That's so adorable! "Loony!" She truly is adorable! Where did I put the port wine? "Loony?" I'll tell Anna de Noailles what you said, she'll love it! "Loony…" Here's the port wine. You're a real little darling. -Are you thirsty? -No. I'm not thirsty, I'm hungry. How troublesome, I'd rather you were thirsty. I have nothing to eat here. Ask your Chinese man. He only knows how to make bird's nest soup and it's really not the season for it. come and sit, my darling. Come… But it's a great idea! I'll send him to Larue, and he'll bring us back some nice little dinner. But I was in the mood for some dried sausage. Some dried sausage? Isn't she admirable? Absolutely admirable! Dried sausage… Come sit down, my dear. Come here. We'll send him to get some dried sausage at Larue. The looks on their faces! That's incredibly funny! I just got an idea. -Why don't we simply go together? -Where? To Larue, for dinner. No, I don't want to go anywhere. I wouldn't want to bump into someone I know. -Do you know that many people? -Not really, no. But bump into just one, and it's a catastrophe. Who are you, you little mystery? This is very nice. Is it from a fancy brand? Who bought it for you? A friend? I'm sure you have a serious relationship, and that's who you're worried of seeing at Larue. A Tanagra statue. You're a small Tanagra statue, and you already belong to a brute! What's he like? He's a lot less loony than you are! A businessman! My God, how horrible! He's a businessman! I'm sure he must be a businessman. Businessmen are abominably boring! You're a little cat. A tiny little cat… And you don't know anything at all. But you've surely noticed that when a man focuses on earning money, he becomes a complete idiot! Well, you seem to have money. It's not the same thing. I don't earn money… I steal it! -No way! You're a thief? -Almost. I'm a writer. Oh, a writer! Yes, I was just thinking, "He has so much paper!" How amazing, how admirable! Paris! Paris! What an astonishing city! I don't see the connection. Darling, I'm known all around the world! I could have had the Nobel Prize, if only they'd thought of me! Well? The Main Culprit, The Woman and The Lover, The Crying Snake… -Yes! The Crying Snake! -Yes. I've seen it! It's beautiful, isn't it? -It made me bawl! -Well, it was all me. -You wrote that play? -Yes, I did. Tell me why that damn Arnaud doesn't marry her in the end! After how he made her suffer! You're too kind. You're simply too kind. My little child… My little cat… My little common folk… Oh, to become common again… To become a virgin again by your side. You really are loony, then! You want to be a virgin again? You don't understand anything. She doesn't understand a thing! It's so precious, it's… It's priceless! I have an idea. I'll put you in a play… Yes! As dumb as you are… you surely have plenty of talent! Haven't you ever wanted to be on stage? Well, with my friends at school, we'd have fun putting on plays but… Yes? But what? Well? I'll take hold of you. I'll shape you. I'll mold you! Yes, but careful! -Careful about what? -Moulding me. My blouse will get all wrinkled. Isn't she sweet? Isn't she sweet for understanding nothing at all? I meant it "morally", my little darling! Exactly, if it's morally, it can be done from a distance! Why? You don't feel good here, next to me? It really warms me up to hold you close, like this, gently… Without doing a thing. Yes… When you do nothing, it's nice here. Just feeling the heat… It's nice. That's true. Of course, men want nothing more than to hold you in their arms. But… But what, my little cat? Men's hands tend to wander. So, you have to defend yourself, and… you end up having to move. But when you don't move, you feel nice. If I'd had a lover… If you'd had a lover… I'd have liked him to hold me for a long time, without moving. Tonight, for the first time, my heart is happy. You understand? The big, bad wolf who always eats Little Red Riding Hood… who knows if he too hasn't dreamed of something else instead? A brand-new little heart that gives itself away… it's so rare. Careful, I'm not giving anything! I'm only lending. You're a real little darling. Why don't you want me to turn you into a great artist? It must be too difficult. Not for me. I've started the career of many actresses in Paris. I have an extraordinary sense for unearthing talent. I don't know why, but I think you have plenty of talent. We could give it a try. Well? Let's try it right away. I'll have you read something, and we'll see what you're made of. Go on, take your dress off. -Take it off right away! -My dress? Yes! I'll drape you in something. You can't perform a tragic play in that outfit. Come on. In theatre, what matters most is the physique. The physique! Come on, take that off. Take your dress off! Yes, there you go. There! That's good, my little cat. There we go. Keep going. All done. You're so dainty. And nicely shaped! A true actress! Drape yourself in this. Get up. Go on, get up. Just look! You'll be so charming! Look… Charming! -It doesn't look like me. -You're not you anymore! You're not you, you're… You're Psyche! Yes, that's it! You're Psyche. Come, my little cat. Let me tell you something. The Classics… Let me see. All we have is the Classics. You're full of talent, I'm sure you are! I can feel it! Now, read from this, nice and slow… Think carefully about what you're saying. I'll give you the line. -Damn! It's in verse! -It doesn't matter! Say it like you're talking to me. Here, I'll explain. Psyche… is a young woman who was kidnapped by Love… by Love… who took the appearance of a beast. Understand? Alright, go ahead. I'll play the role of Love. "Behold this serpent… "this pitiless monster, whom a surprising oracle has prepared for you, and who perhaps is not as frightening as you had imagined." Go on, read. It's your turn. "Are you, my Lord, that monster who the oracle said threatens my sad life? "You, who seems more of a god, who miraculously deigns to come in person to my rescue?" But… I don't really understand what I'm saying. That's alright. That's alright, my little darling. You're beautiful! You're so beautiful. It's alright. Come here, my little cat. My little Psyche. My little Tanagra statue. My little goddess. My little common folk. I'm crazy… crazy about you! Don't be sad, my dear. I'll buy you a theatre! I thought those two split up. Two weeks ago, she was with Fulcus! Fulcus, the oil baron? No, his cousin. The sewing machine magnate. -And he was with that little singer. -That's right. -Two years ago, they were together. -That ended six months ago. -But tonight, they're together! -Yes. You know what I think? It's immoral! Or it's very moral. With them, no one knows! It's such a scandal! Showing up together in public, when we all know they split up four times! Just look at that! He's taking her by the hand. It's shameful! You can leave a man, but then, don't keep talking to him! You see, love… I believe in love through music. I could try to learn an instrument, then. You idiot! You know… it's a good thing we left them behind in that bar at Les Halles, and come celebrate our first evening here, the two of us. Those smoking cafés are just too snobby. Only at Maxim's do you truly feel at home. Yes. It's a bit too popular, but I love it. The waiters have known us since we were kids. Right, Antoine? Me… I'm a woman of habits. Really? But there's one habit you seem to have lost. How about coming over to my place for a drink tonight? I can see you coming, with your big boots. -You werewolf! -Oh, Maximilienne! It's been so long. I feel like I'm just about to get to know you. You have a beautiful face. Very beautiful. But I wonder what you're really like. -Just ask your friends! -You're so cynical! It's such a shame… I'm feeling so awfully sentimental tonight. Me too, actually. It must be those violins, they make me want to cry. Gypsies should be forbidden! Eating is disgusting! I'd rather feed on rose petals. Do you think the lobster was good? It's just like for women, it's a question we ask far too late. Either way, if the lobster was off… this little detail will save my life. And to think some people pay 100 cents a seat to listen to your witty remarks. -If they knew how empty they can be! -Thank you. And some pay 100 cents just to hear you speak them. -If they knew-- -If they knew what? Nothing. Nothing at all, I adore you. Let's not argue, we'd just ruin our evening. Hello! -Who are you greeting and cooing to? -Mr. Grandsac. -Grandsac? How charming! -Come on, now. You know very well Grandsac was my lover, and I adored him. All of Paris knew! You looked ridiculous with your theatrics. Well, he did want to kill himself for my sake. What about Mr. Lapel Pin? Did that last long? One month at Monte Carlo. He went broke in a month. Mr. Monestier did too, actually. Hello, you big dog! You have the nerve to complain about Grandsac, while you've slept with all the little actresses in Paris. The little ones and the big ones too! -It's not any harder to do. -Well, thank you! Let's say the big ones like you. But the little ones? You're fraying at the edges, my dear. What edges would those be? Do you sometimes give those girls the roles you promise them? It's not just about roles. There's also my charm! That's true. I forgot your charm is famous in Paris! They almost show it around to tourists! How about we go back to my place? Who are you cheating on by coming home with me tonight? All of Paris is in this room. And I'm sure… I'm positively certain that your current lover… is here as well. Go on, guess. Say a name. But how could I guess, my darling? I'd need a whole phone book! You rascal! The moon! Oh, you! As soon as you see a spotlight! It must beautiful, out in the countryside. That gives me an idea. Let's go to Senlis. -Senlis? -Yes. -To my aunt's house. -But what will we say to her? She died three months ago! But she left me a little country house. Well? It would be divine for our reunion. We'll sleep in a bed as tall as the Arc de Triomphe, with a big, red comforter. But I have nothing to wear! That's fine, I'll give you one of my aunt's old nightshirts. Did we first meet in 1908 or in 1907? I think it was June 1907. Remember the strawberry Chambéry we had at the Tortoni terrace? I'd just left an audition at Bernstein. You waved at me with your boater hat. You were wearing a green and brown houndstooth coat. You were wearing an English needlework lace dress. That evening… you held me so tightly in the car that the pattern was printed in red onto my skin. So, I erased every single trace, one by one. And you printed some more. That was love. It's extraordinary on the first day. You feel you're discovering the Americas. Well, then! Christopher Columbus that night… He simply wouldn't stop discovering the Americas! What a night! We stayed inside for three days straight. It was meant to last our whole lives. Then, why did we split up 15 days later? I can't remember. Me neither. Silly, isn't it? We could have loved each other. Yes, it is silly. We could have… Well, life is busy, we have other things to do. I suppose. Well, time to sleep. -Should I move my knee? -No. I like it there. Is it true I snore now? A bit. It's not a problem for me. Alright, good night, darling. Good night, Jeanne. -That's funny… -What is? You weren't being careful. You just called me by my real name. What are you doing there? I knocked, and you said, "Come in." I didn't say that to you. It was in my dream. A young baker's apprentice was knocking. He was bringing me vol-au-vent pastry. I've been here for five minutes. I thought you let me in. It's 12 past noon. Noon? To me, that's dawn! I'm exhausted! I beg your pardon. But not the point of feeling no pleasure in seeing you again. Come closer, my dear Count. Come closer. -Take a seat. -Certainly. Your performance last night was divine. The people around me were very enthusiastic. I was sitting with a colleague from the club, Count Zaki. My goodness, he clapped so hard! I haven't seen him clap since the Russian Ballet. Your flowers were marvellous. I'd never seen so many orchids at once. They're the only flowers I tolerate. First, they don't look like flowers, and second, they have no smell. I simply can't stand nature. You don't say! You're so far away. Come sit on the bed. This might not follow protocol… but I ask you permission to put away my cap. Permission granted. You have a lovely hand. It's very dainty. Yet also strong. Thank you, Miss. I'm a pianist, I love Debussy. I've also won a few sword-fighting competitions. I was very surprised and flattered when I was given your card at the theatre. It must be a heavy burden for a young man to have a name like yours. I don't know. One gets used to everything. -Well? Did you like me in the play? -Divine. In fact, it was the first time I saw you. I already knew you by name, of course. You're all people talk about at Maxim's. So, I was curious. Apart from going to Maxim's… how else do you spend your time, you young old man? I'm an officer, Miss. I'm on duty. In my free time, I go to dinner at Maxim's with Count Zaki. That's all. That's all? I hope women also attend those dinners. Yes, of course. Sometimes. The ones who are decent to have present. But we usually dine just the two of us. Count Zaki and I like to discuss philosophy. He has a very dark mind. Every first Monday of the month, he plays Russian roulette. And if the bullet's in the chamber? That's all as well. You no longer need to wait until the next Monday. -How horribly dangerous! -Quite. Last time, we killed one of Maxim's butlers. The Hungarian army has odd forms of entertainment. Do you play Russian roulette as well? No, Miss. Baron Zaki is a free-thinker. I'm a practising Catholic. I'm forbidden from playing this game. But I like to risk my life in other ways: automobile races. I came in second at the Paris-Madrid in my Panhard Levassor last year. And I've been in a few duels. Life is incredibly dull if you don't take any risks. Well, my little darling! -I'm your little darling? -Yes. Does that shock you? It's incredibly unexpected, but it's amusing. What has your mother taught you? My mother, the Duchess, died very young, Miss. Who looked after you, then? I was raised by some old women and old priests. -Then, Saint-Cyr military school. -I see. I was always taught discipline, had little contact with what we call the realities of life. Yet, I feel I am 100 years old, Miss. I don't see what's left for me in this life. -Travel, perhaps? -I have travelled, of course. My father wanted me to see the world when I was young. I learnt to play cricket, went fox-hunting in Sussex with my cousins in Windsor. My uncle taught me about Spanish art. Though, I didn't go see many museums in Madrid. I've tried to grasp the Russian mind. Or at least, what can be grasped of it. I drank so much vodka. It's true the Russians understand nothing. No, travelling for me is done. I've seen it all. Miss, the reason for this visit, which I wanted to keep short, was to ask you to join me for dinner tonight after the play. I'd be happy to. I will wait in my car in the alley, to be more discreet. We could perhaps find somewhere amusing. Then, if you'd allow me to take you home… Come closer. -You treat me so informally? -Yes, I am. Now, listen here, my little Count… Fancy-shmancy. Yours is one of the biggest names in France. You're a very modern young man, as deep as a grave, and you've never had a boiled egg anywhere else than in Maxim's. And would you believe it, I am Maximilienne de Poussy. It's a name I made up all by myself, and it's all my own. I can't even explain where I'm from because it's like speaking about the moon. The place I'm from, I've left it behind. Now, I no longer need to have dinner with a young man that's loaded, even if he's sad and so refined. -"Loaded?" -Yes, loaded, my dear. Look it up in a dictionary with Count Zaki. If I understand correctly, you're declining my invitation. Do I seem to be declining it at the moment? It's just that I… am less complicated than you are. I don't overthink things. And if I see something I like… I take it right away. But Miss, it's thirty-five past noon now. I had simply come by for a polite visit. It makes absolutely no sense at all. There's an entire mood to set first. You're so cute. Come a bit closer. I really like you. I like you because you're so sad. Close your eyes. Little dogs that are lost… I put a leash around them. You smell good. So… you can treat me informally too? Goodbye, Miss. I'll wait for you in the alley tonight, as agreed. I like you too much, I'll never see you again. My head… What happened? Oh, yes… I was meant to meet that famous actress in the alley. I remember now. Apparently, Zaki was looking for me everywhere. His Archduke had just been assassinated in Sarajevo. He'd been ordered to return to Vienna. It was his final night in Paris. He told me I couldn't abandon him, that we should have an extraordinary party to celebrate this war between our two countries. We both knew we'd have to fight against each other, perhaps even kill each other. The certainty that we'd soon have to kill each other gave our evening a bit of charm. Then, we visited every club. Naturally, Zaki wanted to smash every glass. Zaki always smashes glasses. This time, he wanted the Gypsy violinist to join us. We ended up in increasingly vulgar places. Zaki has a passion for vulgar places. There was a quarrel about the Gypsy violinist's bow, with that strongman who hated music… and the Hungarian accent too. I didn't know what would happen in that war, but at least this time, we were victorious… together, which is quite pleasant for two friends. Then… Then… everything's a blur. Is there no running water in this hotel? I wonder why I chose this place. Oh… Someone's here. Give me a kiss? I was about to leave. Goodbye, then. Will you come back? Do you want my address? You were quite drunk last night. I'm sure you don't remember. I do apologise, Miss. I must have been very embarrassing for you. You know, in my line of work… I've brought back men who were more drunk than you. You're quite a nice drunk. -Except when someone mentioned the war. -The war? I talked about the war? Yes. With your friend, the one with the accent. What did you call him? Kiki? You said your holidays were ruined, women were waiting for you in Trouville, and it irritated you. I found you in that state, but it wasn't an act of kindness. I'm a patriot! So am I, Miss… when I'm not inebriated. Because, you see… it may be "irritating", as you say. But if we must go to Berlin… -We shall go! -My point of view exactly. I'm glad to hear it's yours as well. Do forget everything I said to you last night. Hey, you! You're pushing your luck! Why? My hand… May I ask you where my cap is? -On the table. -Oh, yes. All that's left for me now is to thank you for your hospitality. I left you 50 francs. Would that be enough? You're funny. You pay me twice and ask if it's enough! Since you're paying twice, you could even… -No? -Thank you, Miss. But I wouldn't wish to hurt you. You're a desirable woman, I don't want to offend you. But I must return to the barracks. Fine, go off to work, since it's time for your shift. Listen… This'll clear your head. You're too cute. Don't be scared. Just on the cheek. In case you need to go to war… This doesn't happen to me often. This job usually makes me numb, but last night, I came. You came where, Miss? You're so cute, you don't understand anything! You mean the two of us, last night, we… And how! You're a funny little guy, and you don't even know it. I'm a funny little… Yes. Without your good manners, of course. Last night, you didn't have any good manners at all! No way! I'm really worried for you, Miss. I lose control when inebriated. -Did I take the liberty-- -You took liberties all night long! So, you see? I had to like you. Because working overtime in this job… -I'm flattered. -You can be! When a girl says that to you… Socialite women are courted with violins. Not us! Alright, see ya. If you go to war, try not to die, that would be a shame. Farewell, Miss. Hey! I know there's not much chance you and I will see each other again. But you should say "goodbye." "Farewell" brings bad luck. Give the old woman a coin on your way down. Excuse me. Don't worry, Lieutenant! We'll get them! We certainly hope so, Madam. We'll sort out this assassinated Archduke problem with Zaki, one way or another. War is quite the unexpected. We die a little, but at least we know what we want. Life is what makes no sense and never ends. That's youth talking! If only you'd seen me during the Emperor's time… I'd go to every ball. You'd have fallen in love with me, Lieutenant. I too was beautiful once! I too danced in the circle of love. THE END
