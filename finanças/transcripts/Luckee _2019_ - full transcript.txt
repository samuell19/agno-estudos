Done with the song? Close your eyes. Now, open your eyes. What do you see? Look at the calm and peaceful river Thames. People used to sit at the banks of this river. That's not an appropriate depiction. They used to sit idly. Some people sat there in the company of their loved ones. A few sat there writing to their heart's content. One of them was Shakespeare. Here's what he wrote. "What's in a name?" I just have one question for Shakespeare. What about someone who has the letter "L" in his name? "L." - "L" stands for... - Luckee! FATHER NO. 1. MOTHER. Look at their expressions! Adhokshaj. I will name him Adhokshaj. No. Let's name him Pradhyuman. There you go. It's my father's name. Who was the first one to see the baby? Anna! FATHER NO. 2. He considers himself as my father. Anna. I have a biological father. But Anna was a witness to my birth. I was born in his presence. Anna is at the hospital to meet his ailing father. Let's go nab him. - Stop, Anna! - Stop! Stop! Or else, I'll shoot. Push harder. It will hurt, but keep pushing. Harder... Who are you? - Let's go, More. - Yes, sir. Who was the first one to see the baby? Anna! Whose life did the baby save? Anna's! This boy is lucky for me. So, what will you name him? - Anna? - Anna? Luckee. That's how I ended up having two fathers. When I used to play cricket, this is what Anna used to say. Luckee will be as successful as Sachin Tendulkar. When I used to write an essay, this is what my mother used to say. Luckee will be as successful as the writer Vijay Tendulkar. If I sang in the bathroom... Luckee will be as successful as Sonu Nigam. When I used to sit in front of a computer this is what my father used to say. Luckee will be as successful as Steve Jobs. But I never wanted to be like any of them. The boys of my age were free to have girlfriends. But I had to be home at 7 p.m. Dear God... I always felt like going out with friends at night. I wanted to have a girlfriend. I had already figured the theory of it. Now, I wanted a girlfriend in the practical sense. But that was just not possible in this house. And then, here's what I decided. Dad. I've decided to study BMM. What? - But I'll have to go to Mumbai for that. - What! - What? - What! Are you about to leave us? No way, Luckee. I'll get you any degree you want. Anna, I want to be a director. Once my movie is released in the theaters I will be known as the superhit director Luckee. They'll be proud to be my parents. And people will know you as Luckee's Godfather. Listen to me! You're not going anywhere. And that's final! - Yes. - Enough! It's decided. Luckee will go to Mumbai to study BMW. He is doomed! - Are you alright? - Yes. Take care. I was very popular in college. I had many friends. Just because of one reason. Anna had arranged for my independent accommodation. That is how all my friends got a place to study, to party, and to meet their girlfriends. It was a popular hangout for all of them. And this is the college where we study Mass Media. We study filmmaking and photography here. We also handle quite a few projects. She's beautiful! Shruti. Shruti was interested in Sanket. He's a player! Sanket! Stop it. But Sanket was interested in a lot of women. Sweetie! My baby! Sweetie! All Sanket wanted, was some action. There was one couple who played games all the time. A little lower. Look here! Hit it right there. - Here? - Yes, that's correct. In short, everyone was busy with someone. But I was still waiting for someone special. I'm different, you see. The other boys had wooed ordinary girls. But I had my eyes on a girl who was like a tempest! Life is stressful There's no point living alone Keep aside all your worries And dance away No one knows the future Just dance to the beats Sing and dance Dance all your worries away Guess what? Every day is an occasion Be carefree Living is an art Don't harbor wrong beliefs about life Come, enjoy life Say goodbye to all your worries Living is an art Don't harbor wrong beliefs about life Come, enjoy life Say goodbye to all your worries Frustration steals all your happiness Slow down There's always another day Frustration steals all your happiness Slow down There's always another day Breathe a little more, my dear Dance away Have a nice day! Sorrows are always surmountable But just enjoy life And say goodbye to all your worries As soon as I said "ladies' washroom" the number of viewers increased. You must be familiar with this place, right? Because in our absence, you spend a lot of time here. You write such good things on the wall. There are beautiful sketches out here. But here's what I suggest. Why don't you come and do this in our presence? We will welcome you warmly. Why ruin your present Worrying about the future? Don't worry, be happy That's the headline for the day Why ruin your present Worrying about the future? Don't worry, be happy That's the headline for the day Follow your heart To live a happy and long life You need to start ignoring people Go out of your way, do what you have to Come, enjoy life Say goodbye to all your worries Living is an art Don't harbor wrong beliefs about life Come, enjoy life Say goodbye to all your worries You! Me? It's black in color. He is doomed! Do you like black? Why are you staring from such a distance? Wait, I'll show it to you up close. Hit it! His name starts with an "L" Luckee! His name starts with an "L" Luckee! Take a look at it! You wanted to see it, right? Come on! I was wrong. I really like Jiya. But I shouldn't have stared at her like that. What do you mean? What's the right way to look at a girl? Why don't you look at Gaurav instead? Look at me. - Come on, Sanket! - Come on, bro. The problem is not with you. There's a problem with Jiya. Jiya is very talented. If a girl is immensely talented we should respect that talent. Tell me. Did you slap Luckee yesterday? Yes. Why do you ask? - Where are you? - I'm at the canteen. - Tell me. - Wait, I'll be there. Bro, what do you think? Why did she slap you? - Because she felt-- - What did she feel? - That I was-- - Come on, bro! All men do the same thing. Why did she slap only you? - Why? - You tell me. - Why? - Because she knows that you can't harm her. She knows that her slap will make you sad. And that someone will be here to console you. That's it. Let's go, Luckee. - Go. - Let's go. - Go away, bro. - Stop. I can do a lot more than what you think. This sentence of mine was enough for them to start conspiring against me. Go for it. Sanket was provoking me. Go ahead. His provocation was enough to make my thoughts vicious. I will clear Jiya's misunderstanding, as well as yours. - That's the spirit. - What are you going to do? Here's what I suggest. She slapped you. - Now you-- - Hold on. Don't provoke him. Just keep quiet! You think I'm not capable enough? So, it's decided. I will woo Jiya. And I will... - Woo her? - Yes. - Jiya? - Yes! How will you do that? Luckee will woo Jiya. Which means... Yes! A little romance. A little action. Just a little! There are some basic rules to follow. Once you follow the rules, you can woo any girl. Any girl! Even Jiya. Or Angelina Jolie. - You talk about basic rules. - Yes. That's how Luckee can woo Jiya. If Luckee follows the basic rules, he can woo Angelina Jolie. But let us start with Jiya. What? Are you sure, Sanket? If you follow my instructions carefully... you will woo her within a month. If Luckee follows all your instructions carefully, he will take Jiya on a date within a month. Wrong! Wrong! If he follows my instructions carefully Luckee and Jiya will get intimate with each other, within a month. Aim for more, bro! Not at all. Luckee, you are extremely talented. - Jiya should know about this. - Yes. - Yes or no? - Yes. - Yes or no? - Yes! That's it! What if your plan fails? - Then? - Then... - Then? - Then! Then? Then, Luckee and I will parade the college wearing only our underwear. - When did you decide this? - Just now! No way. He is doomed! Luckee, you are extremely talented. - Everyone should know about this. - I agree. - Right? - Yes. Mind you! A talented person needs to put in a lot of efforts. Show your attitude Fight for your right Eventually... You will succeed! Show your attitude Fight for your right Eventually, you will succeed Show your attitude Fight for your right I'm sorry for slapping Luckee. - But you know-- - Look at her! Apologizing to the culprit's friend? You're saying sorry to her. And the boys are planning something huge. This happens to me all the time. I always get into trouble when I start planning something. Prachi, I've decided. I'll make sure that I get intimate with Luckee. In a month from now, Sanket will be seen in his underwear. And Luckee will have nothing to cover himself up. Luckee! Jiya! Why are you here? Luckee! - You... - Luckee. Listen to me, Luckee. I'm sorry I misunderstood. I shouldn't have overreacted. It's alright. You can slap me if you want to. No. How could I... Relax, Jiya! Jiya... Jiya... Jiya! Luckee! Just once! Please tell me that you've forgiven me. I've forgiven you, Jiya. - Really? - Yes. Of course. Yes. Calm down. Jiya. The first girl who hugged me and did not consider me as her brother. I haven't changed this t-shirt since that day. I dream about Jiya slapping me. And then hugging me tightly. As I dream on, she slaps me gently. And hugs me... tighter. Don't do that-- Jiya's memories are linked to that t-shirt. Bro, we are running out of time. Do something. What should I do? Hey! - The t-shirt-- - We don't have much time. You need to decide! Who's going to strip down in a month? We, or Jiya? No! This intoxication called love It's always around me It's always around me I carry her fondly in my heart I carry her fondly in my heart She resides in my heart Like a star shining brightly In the night sky Like a star shining brightly In the night sky Ever since I saw her I got intoxicated... I can't do this. Stop! I've never done it. There's always a first time. Do you know this person? - Who? - Maurice Koechlin? - Kalki? - No. - Okay. Neil Armstrong? - Yes. When Neil Armstrong was on his way to the moon did he say that he is nervous because he's never been there before? No, right? Right. This intoxication called love... A journey to the moon is a different matter altogether. Even this feels the same. You feel like you are flying. It is slightly scary, but a lot of fun. You're like a snake. A powerful snake! Gradually, eventually... Through my eyes... Jiya! Luckee? Jiya! No, Jiya. I don't want to make you feel awkward. Jiya, I really like you. I just want to say that... I couldn't bear to see you upset the other day. Let me hold your hand. I need to tell you something. Let me hold your hand, Jiya. Jiya, you have hairy hands. Kunal! Jiya's boyfriend. He is doomed! I take good care of her. Kunal? Jiya's boyfriend? Tell me. How should we start? - Start what? - Should we do it while standing? Or sitting? Hit it! Or... His name starts with an "L" Luckee! Move! His name starts with an "L" Luckee! What did you say? - You'll take care of Jiya? - No... - Kunal? - Kunal! Jiya's boyfriend, right? He was! They are dating each other for the past three months. They were! They aren't dating anymore. Have a bite. Have it for Jiya! At the fresher's party, Sanket and Kunal were completely wasted. Oh, yes. They both know each other very well. Wait a minute. Are you trying to provoke him? Luckee. Do you understand? He got you beaten up just to win the bet. What? Do you believe her? - Luckee! - I never lie. - Luckee! - You trust me, don't you? Luckee, whom do you trust? Me, right? - Yes. - That's great. - Yes. - Luckee! Very good. That's it. Hey, bro! You're my true friend. What the hell was she saying? "Sanket is Kunal's friend." "Sanket got you beaten up just to win the bet." "Sanket and Kunal were completely wasted at the party." It's true. What? That's an investment. - To hell with your investment! - Hey! Now that Kunal has hit you, Jiya will definitely come and see you. Luckee! Nikhil, Gaurav, Sanket. What do you guys think? You think I can't hit Kunal? I could have smacked him! But I decided to let him go. Jiya's boyfriend is like my boyfriend. Are you mad? I mean, Jiya loves him. Louder! Jiya loves him, right? - Yes. - Jiya loves him. Jiya will be troubled if I hurt Kunal. And if Jiya is troubled, I will be troubled. But, Luckee... He hit my friend. I can't just sit back and tolerate-- No! No. - But if you harm Kunal... - Speak in that direction. If you harm Kunal... our friendship will be over. Luckee! Jiya? She's here! Luckee. I'm feeling guilty. Because Kunal hit you. Don't feel guilty. I hope you're not angry with me. Smart-ass! I can never be angry with you. - Luckee. - Yes? Yes? Your eyes are swollen. First, you need to recover. The swelling will subside in a while. We can hug. Luckee? What? Kunal is not going to hit you ever again. My father is going to teach him a lesson. Sir, I didn't trouble your daughter. In fact, I hit the boy who was troubling her. Do you know what he did? Wait a minute. Look at this. Let me hold your hand, Jiya. I need to tell you something. - What's his name? - Luckee. There's a girl named Jiya in your college. Yes, sir. But please don't bother her. It's not her fault. I love her a lot, sir. I think about her constantly. I'm Jiya's father. Bro, open your eyes. Bro! Open your eyes. They are open. Can you see me? Yes, I can. - So, listen to me. - What? Bro, this time the performance has to be real. - Okay. - Listen to me. This time when Jiya comes home, you'll be all alone. - Right. - You will be alone. - Jiya? - Just you and Jiya. Even if she touches you... you should scream. - Okay. - The moment she touches you... - What should you do? - Scream? Yes! - She will come closer. - Okay. And then... You're like a snake. A powerful snake! - Keep your eyes open. - Okay. She'll see the love in your eyes. But he didn't hit me on my neck. Bro! You know the truth. I know the truth. But Jiya doesn't know the truth! - Did you understand it well? - Yes. Do you want any perfume? No. You're like a snake. A powerful snake! Make me proud, bro! And, like a newly wedded bride I was waiting for Jiya. But there was no sign of her. Soon, the morning turned to noon. Then it was the evening time. And then came the night. I kept waiting for her. My neck started aching because of that belt. Jiya. Jiya? I'm coming. Luckee! Luckee? - You guys... - What happened to you? - You should have called me. - What happened to you? Luckee! As usual, my family problem crept up. Both my fathers had started competing once again. Who's your enemy? Tell me who it is Quickly! Anna. Nothing has happened to me. Who was that girl? The one who came to see you. Tell me who that girl was. Luckee! Emotional connection! Wonderful! What are you saying? Don't feel shy. Now, we are more like friends. Almost similar to each other. Anna's philosophy was beyond my understanding. What are you saying, Anna? You must! It's advisable to be experienced. My family wasn't leaving me alone. I was feeling suffocated. Just like the kids who are frustrated when they see cars parked all over their playground. Meanwhile, Sanket had a superb idea. Without informing me? There's no such commitment. I don't have to share everything with you. Listen to me. Two people were extremely confused to see Jiya there. The first one was Shruti. And the second one was me. Shruti was unable to believe that Jiya was coming to Goa. Honestly, even I couldn't believe it. But I had to believe it in order to deal with the reality. Then, I forgot about all my worries and started focusing on being a powerful snake! I got into the bus. - Bro! - Yes? Stop being sentimental. It's time to play it smart. Be alert. Don't miss a chance. Be ready. - What do you mean? - I mean, all of them are with us. No. Bro. I think your Facebook status is about to get changed. - She needs it as much as you do. - Well... - Luckee! - You? You're here! Luckee! Do you have a power bank? I want to charge my phone. Bro! Take this power bank. - And go charge her phone. - Yes! Luckee... He's a player! Sit next to me. And there's a charging point in the bus. Aren't you ashamed about eve teasing a girl? All of you are just the same. And this is the proof. You threw it in my direction. I think you've fallen in love with me. Love? Yes. You're in love. Yes. You're a cheater. You're a con man, a thief, a robber. Don't say that. You made me fall in love with you. This is cheating. I'm scared, Vijay. Vinod. Don't be scared. God helps those who help themselves. Now, if you allow me. Can we spend the night together? Got a naughty feeling Both of us are under one ceiling Got a naughty feeling Both of us are under one ceiling Our hearts are racing Let's look for a corner Let's look for a corner Your touch excites me Let's look for a corner Got a naughty feeling Both of us are under one ceiling Our hearts are racing Let's look for a corner Let's look for a corner When you held my hand I felt like I was flying - I felt like singing - I see My voice was quite hoarse before It's your magic, sweetheart Open the doors to your heart I'm shivering Place a bag on my lap I'm shivering Place a bag on my lap Our hearts are racing Let's look for a corner Let's look for a corner Your touch excites me Let's look for a corner All the twists and turns Seem dear to my heart Every time you touch me My heart dances with joy The moment I saw you I fell in love with you Your eyes have cast a spell Listen to me now Tell me You're my dream girl Get lost Listen to me now You're my dream girl Our hearts are racing Let's look for a corner Your touch excites me Let's look for a corner Your touch excites me Let's look for a corner Your touch excites me I'm having a severe headache. Migraine problem, you see. That's why. Come on! Get off the bus! - We've reached! - I didn't sleep well. Get ready quickly. I'm troubled with migraine. You guys can carry on. I'll get some rest. - We'll stay here as well. - Yes. Let's play PUBG. My luck was favoring me in Goa. To make sure we get privacy Sanket was trying his best to send everyone away. - What about Jiya? - Luckee is there to take care of Jiya. Hey, bro. Jiya is not coming with us today. - Why? - Because she has severe headache. And you... Please excuse us. Don't come with us. - Why? - Because Jiya has a headache. But I'm already ready. I have a swimsuit-- Don't you remember who you are? Go. - Jiya? - Yes. Are you having a headache? Aren't you going with them? No. I won't go with them either. Smart-ass! Are you feeling better now? You've stayed back because I was in pain, right? Yes. You need to come here and take care of me. Come here. Shall I? Yes, please come. I'll make some coffee for you. Let's make some piping hot coffee. Coffee is an arousing drink. Open the coffee packet. Hot water, milk. Slowly stir the sugar in. And then... Serve it in a cup. Piping hot! Take it. Yes. Enjoy the coffee. I'll go and take a shower. Life... What are you doing, Shruti? Please click some pictures. - Bro! - Sanket! She went in to take a shower. You should have joined her. But I've just had a bath. Sanket, I'm worried. - I should leave... - Bro! Don't worry! Please! - Oh, my God! - Close your eyes. Now imagine something that will make you feel relaxed. Okay. - Are you imagining something? - Yes. What is it? My grandma is preparing delicious pudding for me. What? - Forget about your grandma. - Okay. - All okay now? - Yes. Now, imagine Jiya. What are you imagining? Jiya is preparing delicious pudding for me. Forget about the pudding! Oh! - Okay. - What are you imagining now? Jiya is preparing... Hey, you! - Stop imagining things! - Why? - Why? - Just stop it. Come on, bro! Listen to me. Yes? Jiya is about to come out of the bathroom. Her hair will be wet. Probably falling over her shoulders. Go close to her. - She will ignore you deliberately. - Why? - Make a move when it's least expected. - Really? - You should kiss her. - Okay. And then... Bro, do you have "protection" with you? - What do you mean? - Condom, you fool! Hey! I don't have it. Jiya won't be ready for this. Really? She'll never be ready for this! Come on, bro! The circumstances are favorable. You are about to get close to her. You should have carried a condom. Yes. You should have asked me. I had it. We can't back out at the last moment. Sorry, Sanket. What do I do now? Oh, God! You need to go out and buy a condom. - Right now? - Yes. What if she asks me why I was carrying it? Tell her that you love collecting condoms. Come on, Sanket! Come on, bro! Tell her it is mine, but don't take the risk. Sanket, I've never bought a condom before. Bro, this is something our family never buys for us. Exactly! We have to buy it for ourselves. Yes. If the parents are really concerned about their children, they should buy it for them. Yes. - They cover our notebooks. - Yes. They give us a raincoat to protect us from the rain. Yes. They made sure we wore a sweater during winter. - Absolutely. - So, when a son gets old enough... Enough. Stop it. I'll go buy a condom. Bro. This intoxication called love It's always around me I carry her fondly in my heart She resides in my heart Like a star shining brightly In the night sky Ever since I saw her Luckee! Hit it! Everything that's necessary Is missing from his life Luckee! His name starts with an "L" Luckee! His name starts with an "L" Luckee! Yes, Jiya. Tell me. Where are you, Luckee? Jiya, I read about migraines on Google. I've stepped out to buy a tablet. Which tablet, Luckee? Jiya, I'll get you the best one. I'm feeling better. Please come soon. Yes, I'll be there. I'll be there. I need to go to the medical store. - I don't want any trouble later. - What? I mean, I can't see you in pain. I'll go, get a tablet for you. I'll be there. I'm coming. Where can I find a chemist? Right there. Stop! He is doomed! I'm innocent! Trust me. I'm not a local resident. I'm from Pune. I study in Mumbai. Keep quiet. Sir, shall I take charge? - Not a local resident? - That's right. - You're from Pune? - Yes. - Studying in Mumbai? - Yes. - Trying to make a fool of me? - No. We've come here on a college trip. We are staying at the resort. Look at my college ID card. - My friend. - What? My classmate is suffering from headache. I came out to buy her a medicine. Is that the truth? I swear, Uncle! I came out to buy her a medicine. Buy it and go back to the resort. I'm grateful! Take it. Let's go. Luckee! What do you want? Please speak up. Don't touch it! Please don't touch it. The fenugreek will get even more bitter. My son already avoids eating it. My son doesn't like it either. The new generation does not believe in developing good habits. But they quickly adapt to bad habits. Hey, tell her what you want. Sure. Some pills to cure a migraine. Which one? - The best one. - Okay. I'll get it. - Yes, migraine. - Here. 150 rupees. 150? Well... And I would also like to buy a... Do you want some cotton buds? - Yes. - Give him some cotton buds. I thought he wanted this. - Take this. - Two for 50. Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

I must drop you. Come on. - Hey! - You consider me your uncle, right? You must obey me. Come on. Great, he's not even answering my calls. Hello, Sanket. Hey, bro! You weren't answering my calls. Please don't misunderstand. It's okay. I'm glad that you're busy with something else other than answering my calls. - Did you manage to do it? - Yes, I bought some medicine for Jiya. Really? I'll call you back. Call me when you have something exciting to share. Shruti! Show your attitude Fight for your right - Eventually, you will succeed - You will succeed! Show your attitude Fight for your right Eventually, you will succeed Hey! Why are you so excited? I'm celebrating because you are going to win the bet. Hold on! What do you mean? I mean, Jiya is going to teach Luckee a lesson! And these people are not aware about it. Just a minute. Why will Jiya do that? To make sure you win the bet. - Me? - Yes! Who told Jiya about the bet? I told her about it. Why? Why did you do that? You mean, she wasn't supposed to know? I thought you wanted to win this bet. Jiya was furious! - She's about to teach him a lesson. - Really? She asked for my opinion. - She gave me four options. - Then? And I chose option B. What is that all about? Ring-ring Ring-ring Prachi! I'll smash your face! Tell me quickly. I mean the phone is about to ring. She'll dial 100. Complete chaos! What? Don't step out of your room. Anna, I'm in Goa. The contract? Luckee, it was decided. I've already told you this. It's advisable... to be experienced. Shoot! Shoot! Come on, Anna! I'll call you later. Stop! Ma'am! Ma'am! Stop! Ma'am! Oh, no! Ma'am! - I just shut the door. - Ma'am! Please open the door. I won't. Please go away. Ma'am, listen to me. Do you remember that I was here a while ago? The policemen were with me. I gave you the tablets, didn't I? Ma'am, I don't want those tablets. You had guessed it correctly. That is exactly what I need. Ma'am! You had teased me about it. Do you remember? Ma'am! I want that. Take it tomorrow, my dear. This is not something that can wait until tomorrow. Ma'am! Please try to understand my situation. I'm sure you must have loved someone dearly. Her romance! Bring it on! I've got a feeling... Ma'am! For the sake of your first love! I've got a feeling... I've got a feeling... - Ma'am! - Yes? I feel like I'm completely drenched Ma'am! The rain... Ma'am! Are you there? Ma'am! - Were you thinking about the past? - Yes. I was thinking about the past. I was thinking about the roses. Peanuts. Snacks. We also shared an ice candy. Do you want this? Hey! This is what you need! Hey! Go away! - Wait! - Shut it down. I need the medicine. We've called for a shutdown. - But I want the medicine. - Shut it down! What's wrong with you? I need the medicine! Get lost! - Stop-- - Go away! Go away! Get lost. Get lost. Go away! Oh, man! Is he your friend? No. He's their friend. BHAU. POLITICAL SYMBOL - A TIRE. Bhau will not spare you!

Luckee, it's me. Shruti. - Yes, tell me. - Here... - What's the matter, sir? - Hey, make way. Where are you? They have called for a shutdown here. Shutdown? Please don't enter Jiya's room. That's not possible, sir. I have already decided! I have to do it! Luckee, Jiya is going to put you in trouble. What? Bhau is with you? Bhau? Yes, Bhau! How are you? He disconnected the call. What? No, Bhau. I'll be there. We'll discuss this in detail. I'll tell them. Sure, I will. Shall I ask your men to step back? He has asked you to maintain a distance of one kilometer between us. Maintain a distance of one kilometer between us. - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! - A distance of one kilometer!

Pumpkin, orange... - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! - Catch him! - I got him! - Did you see him? - No! - Hey! Help me! - We need to help him! I was scared! Oh, God! Hey, Sanket. Wow, bro! You sound exhausted! Sanket, I'm in a garbage truck. I can't bear the stench. That's why I'm sounding exhausted. What do you mean? What happened? Sanket, listen to me. I think destiny has something else in store for me. - Bro! - Yes? Concentrate on Jiya! Once you are confident, everything will be okay! Bro, you are immensely talented! All you need is a chance! Yes. Hey! No! What's happening? Where am I? What's happening? Hey! Where am I? His name starts with an "L" Luckee! Here's your tea. Uncle, now you know my story. I've faced a lot of challenges today. Uncle. Listen to me. Please help me. If I end up marrying Jiya, we'll name our first baby after you. What's your name? Kadaknath. Kadaknath Luckee Shivale. I'll name him Nath. Is that okay? What's your problem? You can get intimate with her. Why do you need a condom? I need it. Because she won't get intimate with me if I don't use a condom. Don't laugh at me. Where can I find it? So, you have her for a day? Hey! I love her. What about her? She will fall in love with me. - Most probably. - Most probably? Most probably? Probably. - Listen to me, Luckee. - Yes? Even my father was a crane driver. This is what he told me. He said... "Listen to me, Kadkya." "This is how it goes." "You will receive what you are ready to give." For example if we throw garbage in the ocean its waves will bring the garbage back to us. Similarly, if you give her love you will receive it back. Don't be uncertain. Be confident. Correct. Correct? What's the matter with you? You had looked at her lovingly. That's when she had slapped you. This is how it goes, Luckee! You will receive what you give. She slapped you. Now, you... Listen up. Listen to me. I will continue to love her. But this time... Here's what you can do. - Keep walking ahead. - Okay. - You'll come across a crossroad. - Okay. Turn to your left from there. You'll find a shop over there. It will be closed. Bittu's shop. Knock on the door. Tell him that Kadaknath has sent you. Ask him to give you a gum boot. Every village has its own code word. A small gum boot? Uncle, I hope to see you in Pune someday. You must come over to have pudding made by my grandmother. See you. I don't care what you do indoors, Jiya. Do as you please. But don't involve the police. Wait and watch. I'll teach Luckee a lesson. I have a lot of ideas in mind. Shruti. You were talking to Jiya, right? Shut up. BITTU'S SHOP. Bittu! Who is it? Bittu. Open the door. Kadaknath has sent me. I want a small gum boot. Please open the door and take it. It's locked. How am I supposed to take it? Come inside. I'm waiting I'm waiting for you to do something - Hey! - Yes? Your eyes! Your eyes! Hey, Bittu! Hey, Bittu! Give me a cigarette. They're here. The freeloaders. Bittu! Give it to us. What are you doing in there? Bittu seems to be busy! Come on, give it to us! Are you there? He is not responding. Here's your cigarette, you idiot! - Pull him out. - Let me go. Let me go, you moron. - Damn you! - Hey, there... Let me go! Calm down, Raju! - Don't cry, sir. - Raju! - We've made this shutdown successful. - Yes! How will I face Bhau? I need to beat that boy up. Otherwise, Bhau will not spare me. Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! Raju is superhit! Are you giving it to me? What? The small gum boot. The small gum boot. It gives me a look and smiles stealthily My life seems to be perfect now Hiding it in my fist And caring about it more than my life Timidly, it came to me on its own How can I love her without you? Standby me That's my only wish That's my only wish It gives me a look and smiles stealthily My life seems to be perfect now I offer you my heart Please accept it I offer you my heart Please accept it I desire a special place in your heart I need to stay there forever Go deep, bit by bit Don't go away Stay near me Standby me That's my only wish It gives me a look and smiles stealthily My life seems to be perfect now I offer you my heart Please accept it I offer you my heart Please accept it Now, I just wish to be at your service Give you everything that I own Live for you and die without you My emotions are attached to you Standby me That's my only wish It gives me a look and smiles stealthily My life seems to be perfect now I offer you my heart Please accept it I offer you my heart Please accept it I offer you my heart Please accept it... Hit it! No one can really help him No one can change his destiny His life is doomed He is always getting into trouble His name starts with an "L" Luckee! Stop! Stop, I say! Hit it again! Hey, excuse me! Uncle! Stop! Please stop! Stop! Please stop! Uncle! Please slow down! Uncle! Excuse me. I don't want that rooster. Uncle, I want the bag. Uncle! I don't want that rooster. - Are you sure? - Uncle... Shall we walk? I want that bag. Uncle! Uncle... What? Stop! Let's take a break. I can't run anymore! Oh, God! Uncle! I... I don't want that rooster. Sure? I want that bag. - Oh, God. I need to run! - Hey, stop. Stop! We decided to take a break. That bag contains something very personal to me. - The rooster? - No, Uncle! You're a man, and so am I. Please try to understand. That's a rooster, not a hen. - Hey, no! - What? - I didn't mean that. - Really? Uncle! Besides that rooster, the bag contains something very personal to me. I don't want the rooster. Are you sure? Yes, Uncle! I don't want the rooster! Are you sure? - Do you want some money? - No. Give me your number. I'll transfer money right away. No. - You don't want the rooster, right? - Uncle! I am pretty sure I don't want it! Alright then. Even I don't want your money. It's my 12th wedding anniversary. I've promised my wife Priya - that I'll bring home some chicken. - By stealing it? Hey! I can steal an elephant for Priya! This is rather easy. Does she know that you are stealing? It doesn't make a difference to her. She loves me a lot. Let me tell you something. I was imprisoned for three days. She didn't eat for three days. She kept waiting for me. When the police had nabbed me for theft they had beaten me up. But when I got back, Priya had given me a body massage. That's it! Tell me something. Isn't this the ultimate form of love? I agree. My Priya... I can't stop talking about her. Okay, bye. It's getting late. Rooster... Today, it's you. This is your bag. Finally, Priya will have some chicken tonight! Let's go. Uncle! You are very lucky. My wishes to Priya as well. She is also very lucky. But you're not lucky. You're like a snake. A powerful snake! Forget about Priya. Think about Jiya. Otherwise, she will marry someone else. And you'll be an uncle to her children. Will that be okay with you? Look at Uncle Luckee! - Uncle Luckee. - Uncle Luckee. No! No! - Do you remember the bet? - Yes. So, forget everything else. And think about this. After 20 years, instead of being an uncle to Jiya's children you can be their father. Jiya is ready. You need to show some courage... I will! I'm going to be extremely courageous! I am definitely going to be a father to Jiya's children. Oh, no! I need to meet Bittu again! No one can really help him No one can change his destiny His life is doomed He is always getting into trouble Stop! Excuse me! Please help me. My girlfriend is not well. I need to buy medicines for her. He is doomed! Today my luck has favored me. But due to the shutdown, I am facing a lot of trouble. Do you know what the problem is? My girlfriend Jiya... is not unwell. She's waiting for me in her room. By now, I would have gotten intimate with her. But somehow, we couldn't. Get down. He is doomed, yet again! Kunal? Kunal! Jiya's boyfriend? You're here! Where do we begin? I believe I should start, right away. I won't spare you! What? Get lost. Who are you? Is he your friend? No. Theirs. - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! - Tell us! Where do we begin? - Tell us! Where do we begin? Luckee, run! Luckee, run for your life! - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! Luckee, run for your life! God, why are you unfair to him? He might be the next one Occupying that hospital bed Hit it again! Stop! Catch him! Kunal. Hey, Kunal! - Come in. - Okay. He was badly injured. Yes. He's perfectly fine now. Nothing to worry about. Why? Is he sleeping? Yes, he's under the influence of anesthesia. He will come to his senses after a couple of hours. - He will then be discharged. - How many hours? Two hours. Or a maximum of three hours. A doctor is like the messenger of God. It's true! What? Let him rest here tonight. But don't discharge him until he's absolutely fine. One for you and one for him. See you. His life is doomed He is always getting into trouble His name starts with an "L" Luckee! Hey! Why are you here? Okay. I told you not to step outside. You're about Ravi's age. My son Ravi. He's in Mumbai. That's why I am explaining it to you lovingly. We can't be sure that we'll return home safely once we've ventured out. Yes. A broken glass can be fixed. But we can't fix a dead person back to life. Uncle. Does my sentimental demeanor confuse you? - I am a father, after all. - Yes. My son lives away from home. I tend to get worried. Will he be alright? Will he be okay? What if he does something bad? What if he's getting into wrong company? I am going to retire from my job in a few years. But I'll be a father until my last breath. - Yes, of course. - Yes. But why are you here? - My friend is injured. - Really? Let's go and see him. - No, he's okay. - Let's go. - Trust me. Let's go. - But... - Where is he? - Later, maybe. Come on. - Salunkhe. - Yes, sir? Where were you? Sir, I was right here. They were looking for you. I went to the washroom. I met the boy who was with us in the morning. His friend is injured. So, I'll go meet him. He might need some help... Where did he go? Please come out. Oh. Come on! What's up with you? Uncle. Let me be honest. Actually, I wasn't looking for medicines to cure a migraine. This! I was looking for this. But you guys were with me at the shop. So I couldn't ask for it... in front of you guys. I couldn't do it. You guys are elder to me. I'm coming. I'm still looking for the medicines. I'll be there, Bittu. Who is it? Please open the door. Come inside. No... No! Please come out. I visited you just a few hours ago. My green bangles... Well... I need that. Again? Yes. The previous one got damaged. Why are you looking at me like that? A rooster damaged it. Oh, no! Bittu, look at me. Can I get one more, please? Yes. I have many. - Come inside. I'll give it to you. - Hey! Stop. Don't come near me. I'll go inside and get it. But... No. Stay right there. How much does it cost? Bittu! Your hug is magical. If you hug anyone tightly they'll fall in love with you. I sell many gum boots in a day. They are cheap. But I can gauge that... you are born to love. Bro! You are not born to love. You are born to be a player! I was even more confused after that conversation with Bittu. Is my hug really that magical? Am I really born to love? If so, why am I trying to behave like a Casanova? It's decided. Now, I am going to be an innocent lover. I will spread the message of love. Luckee. Luckee! Sanket, you were right. Jiya is an extremely talented girl. Since she is so talented, I ought to respect her. Let me tell you something. I know I am not experienced enough. But that doesn't mean I can't get intimate with her. So, you have her for a day? Hey! I love her. What about her? Priya loves me a lot. I'm a thief. But that doesn't make a difference to her. I was thinking about the roses. Peanuts. We also shared an ice candy. - Why did she slap you? - Tell me. Because she knows that you can't harm her. I can do a lot more than that. You are born to love. The new generation does not believe in developing good habits. But they quickly adapt to bad habits. Luckee will be as successful as the writer Vijay Tendulkar. - As successful as Sonu Nigam. - As successful as Steve Jobs! He will be as successful as Sachin Tendulkar! This is how it goes. You shall receive what you are ready to give. Similarly, if you give her love you will receive it back. Tell me something. Isn't this the ultimate form of love? Do you want this? Luckee! You are very close to her! Time to get intimate with her! Jiya. This is for you. Now you will never suffer from migraine. Because I will always carry these tablets. Jiya. I want to tell you something. Pumpkin... orange... carrot and beet! Raju is superhit! - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! Hit it! Hey, Luckee Open up! Open up, Luckee! Tell us your story Open up, Luckee! Tell us your story Your life is doomed Your family has lost all hope Because you are never going to get lucky Luckee! Hit it again! His name starts with an "L" Luckee! His name starts with an "L" Luckee! What made the city shutdown? What does Bhau Saheb want? The actor Aamir Khan from the movie PK! - Where is he? - Look in that direction! - Let's go. We need to shoot this. - Okay. Are you Aamir Khan? Have you come from another planet? Where are you from? Is this your costume? It's a costume, right? It's theirs. BHAU. POLITICAL SYMBOL - A TIRE. The shutdown has been called by Bhau Saheb. The other planets are supporting him. Don't be surprised! I think Bhau's supporters have started a tire movement in support of this shutdown. With cameramen Martin, this is Shilpa Bandarkar reporting. Even God cannot help him He is clueless about most of the things His life is quite useless His future seems to be one big zero He is like the hero of a flop movie He is like an old rusted furniture piece He is not at all lucky Even though his name is Luckee His life is as dry as a desert His happiness is short-lived Stop! What's wrong? Why are you guys running after me? What have I done? In fact, I need protection. I've been looking for it since morning. But Raju and his men are after me. Why? Because I slapped Raju in front of everyone. I slapped him because... I was in desperate need for protection. Mr. Raju! Mr. Raju! I apologize to you in public. I'm sorry I slapped you. Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! Raju is superhit! Come on, everybody! - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! - Pumpkin, orange, carrot and beet! - Raju is superhit! Look at yourselves! Why are you guys wearing tires? Why are you wearing tires? Why are you following me? Do you have the habit of following people? The herd mentality? You wore a tire and started running about just because I was doing so. They called for a shutdown and you followed their instructions. Why? Why do you want the shutdown? And how can you achieve success by declaring a shutdown? Life is all about moving on! What is the purpose of this shutdown? The interest of the masses? Ask them if they really want this shutdown. Everyone will achieve what he desires on the basis of his strength. Why am I telling you all this? I'm no different. I also get influenced by others and follow them blindly. But now, I've understood what I want. Thanks to Jiya's migraine, I've now come to my senses. She suffered a headache. But I felt its pain. I was confused in the morning. But now I have enough clarity. This is what I am! I really wanted to say something to Jiya. - Something I really mean-- - So, speak up, Luckee. Speak up. Please speak up. Everyone should have a friend like him. A friend who really cares. Wow! A friend who is ready to do anything! In the midst of a difficult situation... you helped me deal with my migraine... by wandering on the streets without thinking about your own safety. I misunderstood you. Hey, kid! Hey, there! As soon as you left the hospital this popped out of the machine. Were you looking for this? You should have simply asked for it. Now, take it. Take it. He told me that his friend has a migraine and he needs medicines for her. Silly boy! He is doomed! No! Jiya. Listen to me, Jiya. Was she the one? Do you need any help? Jiya! Jiya! Yes, Jiya. I was looking for condoms. I accept that. I was searching for it since morning. A shutdown was declared in the city. But I wanted to prove myself. Everything I experienced throughout the day... made me realize that I was wrong. An ordinary woman at the shop. When she was talking about the precious moments she spent with her husband she looked as beautiful as you. Kadaknath, a garbage collector. His heart was pure. His intentions were clear. I also met a thief. He was running away from the police. But he was ready to do anything for the sake of his wife. And the police officer Salunkhe. He is doing a tough job, but he is extremely emotional. And Bittu. Bittu. His hug made me realize what I truly am. This... A relationship without love... is not what I'm looking for. I have loved you ever since I saw you. I have never liked any other girl. Dance away, my boy! Oh, no! These naughty eyes want to have some fun! Luckee! What did we decide? Oh, no! I told you! It's advisable to be experienced. No! Is she the one? Yes. He is doomed once again! Do you remember what I said in the beginning? What about someone who has the letter "L" in his name? There were four songs in the movie. It was funny and there were some romantic scenes as well along with some action. In the end, I also gave a social message. But it still wasn't a happy ending. Whatever had to go wrong, did go wrong. "L" does not stand for "Lucky." "L" stands for "Loser." Hey, Luckee Open up!
