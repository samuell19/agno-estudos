I tell you it was so real, I could feel wind blowing through my hair. Anyway, I ran off with my arms out into the wind and I glided down, all the way down. It was fucking beautiful. You were sunbathing by a swimming pool in Stan's garden. Fucking weird! Yeah. Stan doesn't have a pool. Anyway, so I landed and the next thing I know, I'm rubbing lotion on your legs and your back. That's nice. I was just about to slip you one when I woke up. Oh! Eat up. Help me. [BOTH GIGGLING] Come on, treat. Ow, ow, ow! Eat up, Russell. [farting] You're disgusting. I'm so sticky. I am sopping. I'm wet through. I've got a soggy gusset. You got your pint there. Swap over. Come on, let's swap. Help me right up. Three, two, one. Whoa! I don't know my own strength.

I'll warm my bum on the fire... Quick. Get in there! Tuck right in. It's all right. I think I've got a toasty arse. [BOTH LAUGHING] [RUSSELL SHOUTS] [GROWLS] [SQUEALS] [SCREAMS] [BOTH LAUGHING] Don't you move. I won't. Okay now. I saw your... [BOTH LAUGHING] I'm just going to go for a tinkle. All right.

[DOG BARKING] [SPLASHING] Come on out immediately. [DOG WHINING] [HIGHLAND MUSIC PLAYING] [SHEEP BLEATING] [GRUNTS] [ENGINE STALLING] [WATER SPLASHING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Where have you been? I was worried. Listen, Lucy. I am really sorry about last night. I didn't... I was drunk. I shouldn't have driven. I got the car stuck. I fell asleep. I'm a loser. WEM: Oh, my Lord! You heard about Britney? No. What's happened to Britney? She just vanished. Just out there on the moors. Really. Where's Betty? Where's Betty? Wem. I'm so sorry, Wem. Betty's gone. Gone? Yes, Wem, gone. Gone gone? Yes, Wem. Gone gone. Where's she gone? Come on, Wem. I'll take you home. [MURMURING TO HERSELF] LUCY: We just can't find her at the moment. Sorry, Wem. [WHISPERS] Sorry. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] All right then, Steven. In your own words then. Look, for the seventh time, we are all here. Everybody else is gone. I sat down. She was on top of me. We were having a bit of a fondle. Whatever... What classifies as a fondle nowadays, then? Oh, whatever. She was on me, then she said, "Wait there, big boy. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back in a minute. I'm off for a piss." All right. I'm pretty sure she said that. What time was that, like? About midnight? I'm not sure. Then what happened? Then she gets up. I'm still on there. She gets up. She moves this way and she makes a beeline straight down there for a piss, I presume. Right. Down there for a piss? Down there for a piss, massive piss. She'd had quite a bit to drink. Yeah. And she can't have gone left, 'cause you got this bit here. And I didn't hear a splash, so, no, I presume she never went in. Did you hear her splash, or no? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [WINDMILL CREAKING] BAGHI: Do you see it? Well done. You all right? Yes. Let's go away now. TIM: What if he didn't take them to the zoo? I mean, what if he kept them? What if he let them go? BAGHI: That's a lot of "what ifs." Anyway, all this is mental. A croc would never survive out here in the moors. Not in winter. [LIGHTNING CRACKS] Nothing's changed. Not one bit. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Feel it. Go on. [THUNDER ROLLING] It's warm. Yes. Come on, Ravi. [WHISPERS] Dad. Not now. Not now, Ravi. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Oh, God! [POLICE RADIO CRACKLING] RAVI: Dad. BAGHI: Not now, Ravi. Weston? Constable! Weston. Weston. Would... Can we have a quick word, please. Constable? Weston? TIM: Seriously, you need to listen to me. We were down by the river, and I know this sounds mad, but we found this, it's a crocodile tooth, look. You look terrible! [CLEARS THROAT] Here, have it. [BOTH WHISPERING] Found Miss Dunstan. Just her head. Just her head? [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] Listen up, Tim, here. Back from his travels. Found a crocodile tooth, right here on West Moor. He says there might be one in the ditches. TIM: Yes, that's true. Uh, Baghi's son here, he found the tooth, the croc tooth out on the West Moor. And we believe that it might be from a big Nile croc. If that is true, then I must point out that a crocodile is a dangerous animal. Must not be approached under any circumstances. What's going on? Come on. REPORTER: Constable Collett? News Room South West. Can you confirm for us that this case is turned into a murder investigation? I'm afraid I can't confirm anything at this time. What can you let us know? Some new information has come to light about a tooth, thanks to Mr Tim Webber. REPORTER: A tooth? CONSTABLE: Other than that, I'm afraid that's all I can say. Thank you very much. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Good afternoon. Excuse me. I'm wondering if you could help me. NEWSREADER: Fresh concerns mount today as local teenager, Britney Edzoy has been reported missing. Last seen at a party here on the moors last night, friends at the scene say she simply vanished. This disappearance follows in the wake of a Bristol teenager who went missing last week. You all right? Yeah. Everything's just great. I've only been home for five minutes, I've killed my Dad's dog and managed to close down the family business. So, yes, everything's just fine. Thank you for asking, Lucy. [SIGHS] What am I doing? [KNOCKING AT DOOR] WOMAN: Mr. Webber? Who's that? Mr Webber? It's News Room South West. Can I ask you some questions? [WHISPERS] Fuck. Mr. Webber? You are the same Tim Webber from the zoo croc incident in 1998? Mr. Webber? That night at the zoo? Mr. Webber? Do you feel responsible for the death of your classmate? The death of your classmate? Tim? [GRINDER WHIRRING] [WINDMILL CREAKING] RUSSELL: Good choice, mate. Yeah. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Come on, Dolly. [DOLLY BLEATING] Good girl. Come on. Come on. This way. Good girl. Stay, low, yeah?

Get that beer in there, yeah? LARD: Look at the size of this! [CHILDREN SQUEALING] LARD: Whoa! [EVERYONE CHEERING] [CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWS CAWING] Talk me through this. How did you kill the crocodile? All right, baby girl, basically, my best mate, Lardy, right? He had this big pitchfork. Right. So he jumps up, lands on the crocodile's head and stunned it for a bit. Then I got it in a headlock which properly killed it. Then Lard kicked it in its penis, which was a bit much because he was already dead. But, yeah. Right. Jesus. Mr. Webber. Mr Webber? The night you broke into the zoo, the eggs were never recovered. Is that true, Mr. Webber? Is this your crocodile? Mr Webber. Please? Is this your crocodile? Did you hatch it? No. No. TIM: My dad said he was gonna get rid of the... Is it your croc, Tim? That was his croc, who killed my sister. Mr. Webber. I ask you again. Is this your crocodile? Mr. Webber? Russ? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CLOCK TICKING] You all right?

Railway Inn. Hello, Kate. Yeah, Russell's here. What, now? Okay. Come on, wake up everybody! Russell, it's your mum. We've gotta watch the news. And today there is good news for this small village here in Somerset. Britney Edzoy who had been feared dead after disappearing without a trace, turned up here at the Webber home in the early hours of this morning. Luckily, Britney is in a stable condition. And is currently on her way to the district hospital for observation. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] All right, Steven? Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Webber. Russ and the whole village knows it weren't your doing and everything. Uh, Mrs. Wembridge said what happened and that. Thanks. Just thought, we'd better, you know... clear the air, right? No worries, Steven. Oh. Any news on Britney? She still ain't said a word. Steven. Hmm? Good to have you back, and Russel. Me and Russell was wondering... No. LUCY: I'm worried about him, Wem. He told me about that night at the zoo. It was in all the papers. Tim couldn't take the attention. That's why he left home. Broke his mother's heart. That's awful. What happened to the crocodile? Well, I know the butcher's boy took a shine to him. WEM: He brought him bits of meat. Never missed a day. I remember him hollering out in the wood shed. One of them took his finger off. WEM: There was blood everywhere. Horrible it were. But where they went, I really couldn't tell you. Did you say "they"? Oh. Yes. Two eggs. Both hatched. But what if someone else gets killed? [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] Dear, silly me. [MACHINE BEEPING] [WHISPERS] It's okay. You're safe now. Who could have done this to you? [HEART MONITOR BEEPING] Caesar. BARTENDER: Caesar. I'll take those.

Kate's boy and Lardy, they tried to stop him, but... He must have them, too. MAN: Get the bastard! MAN 2: Let's get the bastard! I think he might be over the far side of the old quarry. So let's go get him! MAN 3: Yeah! MAN 4: Yeah! Cut. Go. What a fat pig. He's too fat. He's too thin. No good for pies then. I know. We'll make our beauty a larder. I've seen it on the telly. They snag it up, and then let it tenderize. There's enough meat on fat boy there for a month. LARD: Russ. She's mine. Russ. [RUSSELL AND LARD WHIMPERING] Caesar, man. Listen. We're not...
