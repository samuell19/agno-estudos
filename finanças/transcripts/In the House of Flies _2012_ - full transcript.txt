Okay, so let's pretend that you were going to propose to me sometime this century. There, there? Steven. Would you do it in a place like this? This is just random or should I be getting a hint? Take it as you want it? Oh, I don't think so. I mean it's pretty cliché. Yes, it's very cliché and corny and very, very sweet. And I think you'd use more imagination? Oh, yeah? So where am I supposed to propose to you then? I don't know, that's why I asked. Do you smell that? Yeah. Smells like chemical. Steve... Wake up! Wake up! Were we in a car accident? What do you remember? Nothing. Just being in the car. The dial is broken. I'm getting a dial tone. There's nowhere to dial. I think there's something in here. In there! I think it's moonlight out there. I swear there's something moving in mine. Yeah, there's something soft in this one. You can tell when you shake it. Steve! Is the trap door open or closed? Can't tell. I can't tell. I heard noises last night. Oh yeah? What kind of noises? Like from upstairs? Like animal noises from outside. Great. There's a forest out there. If you listen you can hear the wind move the leaves and the branches. You didn't wash your hands. Funny. Hello? Look this is going to sound really fucked up, but whoever you're calling has me and my girlfriend held hostage. We're in a basement. Please call the police and tell them... You broke the window. Let us out of here now! No more destruction or I'll make her burn. Suitcase number one. What? What? Suitcase number one. The combination is 544157. Hello? Who the fuck are you? Give me, give me that. Spread out the map. Put your finger on the falls. Move your fingers nine and three eighths inches northwest. You are in the red circle. This is what they call the middle of nowhere. You understand now. What do they say? We're in the middle of nowhere. It's like the kind you buy at a store. I don't know if... I can't tell. I wouldn't drink that if I were you. Yeah, well it's better than dying of thirst. What's that? I don't know. What is it? Sounded like the dog. It's not a dog. Maybe it's a fox. No. Was there a reason that you brought up marriage? Maybe. Have you been thinking about that all night? You wanna get engaged? Yes. Never took you for the marriage type. I know, right? I guess my mother kind of won that one, huh? Don't tell anyone. Or maybe it's a biological clock thing. I mean I would have though. I wanted to. I mean -I mean I wanted... I know, I know. Never got around to asking. Can you please stop talking in past tense? I really wanted to do it in a really cool way. I know, of course. You could never do it the simple way, right? You know, sometimes there's nothing wrong with the simple way, Steve. You're not saying something. You don't have to. Steve. I'm pregnant. I'm almost two months. I was gonna tell you after the trip but... We're gonna get out of here, okay? We're going to. Shhh. Do you smell that? Smells like raw meat. I had nightmares all night. I could tell. I want to go home today. Okay. I hope the cat's okay. He's fine, probably ate all my plants though. Steve, I just want Togo home today. I know. You don't have to do that. You should drink it. It's okay, it's okay. I just remembered we never ate that one. I can't believe we forgot about it. I have to pee. Go... Should I pick it up? Maybe we'll get more food. How is the baby? There is no baby. Is your baby hungry? What? Do you still feel brave? You're the one who uses... If there's anymore destruction the baby burns.Apologize. I'm sorry. Does your baby want food? Yes. Light a match. Yes. Put it on your palm. Have you learned? There will be no more destruction. Okay, okay, okay. If you behave today, you can have food tomorrow. I behaved. I behaved. Good morning. Good morning. No more trouble. No, no more trouble. Steven. He wants to talk to you. Yeah. Why didn't you stop her from burning herself, Steven? I couldn't. You were incapable of helping her. You were powerless. There's nothing you can do. You're going to watch her die. Did he give you the combination to a suitcase? Apologize. But it wasn't me. I didn't... Apologize. I'm sorry. Are you going to give me the combination to a suitcase? Beg for it. Please, may I have a combination? 489130. Please. I needed a break anyway. Is it working? I don't know. These bricks are pretty solid. I hope when one comes down, they all come down, hopefully not on my head. I love you. I love you too. This ring is driving me insane. Okay take a... I've got it. Take a break. Nothing's worse or better than the ringing. I loosened it for you. Uh huh. Jesus Christ. You've gotta be fucking kidding me. This is as solid as the first. What? How many layers does an onion have? How many weeks will it take you to get through the wall? Fuck you! Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. You never answer me. Do you hear the coyotes? What kind of psycho are you, huh? Are you hungry? Yes. What do you want? Suitcase number three. Hold on. 419122. What is this? This isn't food! Live like rats. The coyotes eat rats. Rats eat rats. Are you hungry? Do you love her? Tell her. I love you. How much do you love her? What could you possibly know about love? Would you kill for her? I'd kill you. She will starve to death. Her baby will starve to death and then both of them will be fed to the coyotes. I'm not talking to you anymore. She will suffer. What can you do to stop it? What is your love worth to her? What are you worth? I want you to know that when I get out of this place, I'm going to torture you in ways so horrible that you can't even imagine. And then when I can't stand to look at you anymore, I'm going to burn this shithole down with you in the fire. Do you know what it is? No. It's too soon. What do you think it is? I don't know. Maybe it's a boy. Or I don't know, maybe it's a girl. I'm almost certain it's one or the other. Either way, it's a smart ass like its mother. Do you want it? I do, yes. But you don't think we're going to get out of here, do you? Do you want it? I wasn't planning on it, not now but... I know. I mean at first I didn't like it when I first found out. And then I changed my mind for awhile. And that's why I didn't want to... I wanted to be sure before I told you. Are you sure now? I want it but I'm scared. That's normal. Maybe. It doesn't help, though. But I figure I want to have babies with you one day anyway, right? I know this point in our lives isn't exactly ideal, but... This point in our lives is... I'm sorry I can't get you out of here. Don't. Let me take over, okay? Heather. How is she? Can we skip the games today? Ask her if she's thirsty. Of course she is. Are you thirsty? There, now what? Ask her how many days it has been since she's had water. He wants to know how many days it's been since we've had water. He wants you to say it. Three days, maybe four. Did you hear that? Four days. Why haven't you provided water for her? It hasn't rained. And you... Isn't a good father supposed to provide for his family? I couldn't help it. Don't you want to be a good father? Ask Heather if you have been a good father to her child? No. Ask. Have I been a good father to your child? She says no. Will you provide for her and her baby now, Steven? Yeah. What does a good father provide his family, Steven? I don't know, love, shelter, food. I don't know what the hell you're looking for me to say. Give the phone to Heather. No. She doesn't want to speak to you. Maybe we'll get water. It'll be okay. You're ruining everything. Didn't you learn your lesson? You promise to behave, but you continue to destroy. Are you thirsty? Yes. Bad girls don't get water. If you don't give us water, we'll die. You know that, right? We'll die. And then your game is over. You behave worse than the others did. Others? You need discipline. What others? You can have water when you've learned your lesson. Why don't you speak to us? Do you want water? Yes. Tell Steven to hit you. Do it now. Hit me. It's okay. Just do it. Tell him that it's not your fault. It's not your fault. Tell him you deserved it. I deserve it. Now you hit him. Harder. Again. That's enough, all right. We learned. Tell him to punch your stomach. What? What? What now? No, no way. Do you want water? Not that badly. Tell him. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Steve? Uh huh? There's blood. Where? In my underwear. A lot or a little? A spot. Is it deep red or pink? It's pink I think. My sister's had that too. It's normal. Are you sure? Pretty sure. What if it's not? I'm not a doctor, hon, but after three sisters and six nieces I learned a thing or two. I'm pretty sure it's normal. You'll be okay. So either no one made it past 28 days or that's how long it took them to get out? Which do you think? Doesn't matter anyway. I think that it's just... Give me some more room okay? Let me see. Give me some more room. Let me see! What? What? It's another room like this one. What? There's no way out. I'm going to be sick. What's he doing? Yes. We get it, okay? We get the goddamn point. We're never getting out of here. And we know it. You... You're listening, right? This is a game, right? You win. You know that already. Of course you do. Your broke us. We get it. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it. We're going to get out of here. Maybe you gave up, but I haven't. Where are you getting your hope from? We're going to smash through more concrete walls? And maybe blow the roof off. And crawl out the window? Fuck! Another hour without food, we'll be skinny and... Stop it. Heather, seriously. Where are you get... How? How can you have any hope? Because. Oh, okay. Oh, okay, because. You know what? You're right. In fact actually, I just thought of an idea. We can... You know what, I'm all out of ideas of how we're going to get out of a basement with no fucking exits. What's yours again? Waiting until this psychotic asshole just changes his mind and lets us go! Go to hell. Give me another day and I'll be there. Steven, if you move, Heather will die. Heather, do as you are told or your baby dies. Get up, with your backs together. Do you understand? Let's play a game. Steve, did you ever play the game statues as a boy? The point of the game is to stand still for as long as possible. And if anyone sees you move, you're out of the game. Let's change the rules. If Steve moves, Heather dies. If Heather moves, Steve dies. If you fall asleep, the other dies. If either of you speaks or makes a sound, the baby dies. Does that sound like fun? Good The game starts on the count of three. One, two, three. They called off the search for you. It was in the news today. They figure you ran off together. Some think Steven killed you. How long do you think you can last before you collapse? Your muscles are deprived. Your body is weak. The nausea and dizziness are spinning your head, aren't they? You're very fortunate. Most people never get to understand themselves the way you are understanding yourself right now. You, more than anyone you know, understands the most primal animal instinct, survival. You also understand the most human of instincts, love. I envy you. In honor of your new understanding, we'll change the rules in our game. Steven, are you listening? Yes. If you die, Heather may go. All you have to do is say yes. No.Don't you do it. Don't believe. He's just going to kill me. Don't you say it. All you have to do is say yes. Yes. All I want to do is sleep. So sleep for a little while. I can't. We're running out of time. I don't want to be sleeping when we should be doing something to get us out of here. I thought you had no hope left. I don't. Steve, my stomach hurts. I've never felt pain like this before. It's just the hunger and the lack of water and the duress. Maybe. Just get some sleep. You'll feel better if you get some sleep. You too. Do you like my new pet? I hate your pet. I've kept a coyote before but it died. They need too much meat. It's hard to keep up with their appetites. Get to your point. You're having a miscarriage, aren't you? Steven has let you down. He's doing what he can. While you suffer, he lies on the floor asleep. Why doesn't he comfort you? We never finished our game, did we? Shut up! Skip all your games. Get to the goddamn point. We should change the rules again. No, no more games. We have another suitcase to open. So let's open it. When your baby dies and falls out of you, you're going to bleed. It will be a slow, maddening death for you. Your baby will be dead. You will die from the blood loss. And then Steven will die too. That's not going to happen. Be realistic. There's no way out. You have only one chance left. Well, what is it. Pick up the gun. Where are you going with this? Point the gun at Steven's head. I won't do it. Point the gun at Steven's head. No. Kill him and you can go. I don't believe you. What choice do you have? No, I won't. You'll do it or you will die. He says that if I kill you that I could go. You should do it. I don't want to. Point the gun at his head. Can you feel it dying inside you? Is it already dead? How could you let your baby die, Heather. Just stop it. Let me think, okay? Talk quiet. I was talking to him, not you. The phone. Heather... What's going on? What's going on? Heather? Let me out. Let me out. Yes. You should go see in the bucket. No. Go look. I don't have to. You have to let us go now. Look at it. Was it your child? No image could evermore powerfully display the worth of a human life than that of a dead fetus floating in a bucket of urine and feces. Don't you agree? You have to let us go. On television, you've seen children from all over the world suffering from hunger, suffering from disease, suffering from war and poverty, haven't you? Yes. Did you ever do anything to help any of them? No. Why not? 'Cause I'm selfish. Would any of them help your child now? No. How did this happen to your child? 'Cause Heather's body was weakened by you. It happened because you are useless to her. You are useless to everyone. Why didn't you stop it? The value of hope lies in the last suitcase. How is she? She's bleeding to death. Give me the other four numbers. Would you kill for her Steven? I've answered that already. Would you still die for her? Yes. Do you have the bullet? If you die, I'll let her go free. Promise. I don't believe you. This is another game. There will be no more food, no more water. 257088.Goodbye, Steven. There's a lot of things I want to say, but I think you know them. I don't even know if you're really hearing me right now. But I do. I love you. Get out of here. Get out of here and... I'm sorry. It's me, please.Please. What? Shoot me. It wasn't part of the deal he said. Please. No. Heather, no. If you love me, you'll do it. Will you? Thank you, thank you. Wait, wait. I love you. He can't see us, but he can hear us. That's why he's banging. That's why he's banging the floor. He's trying to get our attention so that we move so he can see us. Where is it? It doesn't matter. It does. He knew, he knew, he did - he can see inside the bucket. But he couldn't see us sitting there. He didn't know. We got through. It doesn't matter... It does. ...anymore. It does. Show's over, asshole. Tear down the sheets. Grab the calendar. Grab the gun. Point it at the door. If it opens, shoot. Give me the gun. The keys. Come on, come on! Come on! So what now? I don't know. I guess I could call You could do that tomorrow too. Yeah, I could. How are we supposed to just pick up where we left off? You mean us? You're lives. I'm not okay, Steve. So far from okay. Just I keep waiting for something to happen. I really wanted it, the baby. I just feel like it's all gone. But I gotta move forward, right? At first, we'll go on 'cause we don't have any other choice. And then eventually what happened will fade. And we won't think about it anymore. Life goes on, right. Yeah. Life goes on. And just stay there for a bit. Just stay kind of like as if you're adjusting your position. Fuck, dude. Okay, okay, cut. Or no, don't cut. Just you got to move back, bro. Was I in the shot? Yeah. Everyone got to stay still. Oh! Don't break those, dude. Oh, shit. It's okay.
