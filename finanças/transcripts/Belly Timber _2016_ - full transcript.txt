(eerie atmospheric music) - [Narrator] In the beginning, Tengre, the creator of all things, soared over the endless seas and he commanded the rocks to come forth and there was land. And in this land were the tree of life, from which all other forms of life emerged. One of these were the Kala. The Kala were a clan of four families, each from a different branch on the tree of life, and to them was given the power to devour human flesh. In this manner Tengre could create new life from the souls of the recently devoured. For thousands of years, the Kala were contempt to do Tengre's bidding, but over time they became pious and haughty. Seeing this, Tengre was displeased and cast them from their homelands. Two of the families went to the north. The other two families traveled across Asia and Europe and settled in the British Isles. One of these was the Bean clan. The Beans lived in the caves off the coast of Galloway, Scotland. The Beans killed hundreds of men, women, and children, eating their flesh and throwing their unwanted body parts into the sea. The Beans were caught and captured and executed for their crimes. The Leckys, however, managed to escape to America, an unsuspecting herd ripe for the slaughter. (dramatic bagpipe music) - Grandfather. It is time for Belly Timber. (low thudding) (ominous atmospheric music) - We are Kala. Since the dawn to the sunset, we are Kala. Let our forefathers bear witness to what remains. Our ancestors left the icy plains, keeping us pure. And today we pay homage to them that bore us. We are Kala. As our forefathers traveled far, so shall we. We have remained too long in this place. We have become complacent. We are diminished. Now is the time. We shall find new lands. This is the time. As our forefathers before us, so shall you. The darkness is in me. Let my laughter fill the darkness. Let me blood fill the land. Let my knowledge fill your bellies. We are Kala. My time is done. (eerie atmospheric music) (grunting) We, we are Kala. (group chanting foreign language) - Is there any of you that would question my authority leading this family? (knife chopping) (ominous atmospheric music) (banging) (ominous cello music) (footsteps walking) (eerie orchestral music) - What in tarnation? Now you stop that, boy. Now you done went and made me mad. (eerie atmospheric music) (grunting) (hatchet chopping) - [Felix] Handle the body. - Come on, let's hurry up and get to grandpa's house. He promised he'd take us to the fair. - Come on, I'll race ya. - Last one there eats a frog turd. - What's going on, boys? How you doing? (laughing) - [Cyrus] Hi, grandpa. - Hey. Cyrus, you better wipe those frog turds off your mouth before you go in the house. Your mom will kick your butt. (laughing) - Ha ha, grandpa. - Come on. - Hold up. Pull me, pull me. (laughing) So, what did you boys learn in school today, huh? (light piano music) - I learned where out city flag came from. - Really? And what did they tell you? - Well, the flag was made in 1963 by some art student. I think his name was Roger something. - Mmm. It wasn't Roger Gool, was it? - [Boy] I think so, grandpa. - Elle Mae, come in the kitchen and help me. - Yep, Roger Gool. He was an art student at Herron School of Art. But you know, what they tell you in history isn't always the complete story. - Hey, honey. How was your day today at school? - Fine. Why can't I listen to grandpa's stories? - Dad needs to quit telling stories and let you guys get to your homework. - Hey, at least these boys listen to my stories, okay? Now, the story I'm about to tell you boys is one of the best kept secrets in the history of mankind and you can not tell anyone, okay? - We won't tell a soul, grandpa, honest. - Yeah, scout's honor. - Okay. This book is the journal of Bethia McCormick, your great great great great great grandmother and wife of John McCormick. John McCormick was the first white man to settle in these parts here, long before it was a city. Now, the story starts years ago, back in Ohio. (ominous atmospheric music) (light piano music) - [Bethia] I'm writing early tonight. I got all my chores done and John is having some men over to discuss business. Although, when a group of men get together, they all behave like boys, especially if alcohol is involved. And I imagine that George Pogue will bring some of his moonshine with him. He always does. He likes to call it brandy, but we all know he gets it from his Indian friend, Winny. George is a stodgy, portly fellow who thinks he is a businessman, and although he likes to dress like a carpet bagger, everyone knows he's a blacksmith. I'm sure everyone will pick on him. They always do. Men, I mean, boys will be boys. Now, for some exciting news. John got a letter from his brother, Thomas, back in Ohio. Thomas is finally ready to move west. I imagine Sadie persuaded him some. John tells me he's going to pay his nephews to go to Ohio and help Thomas move. Tomorrow, I am going to start a quilt as a welcome to Indiana present for Sadie. - So, who did send a letter first, George? Was it you or was it John? - Charlie, why do you even bother asking? You know George always says he's right. Said it enough times, it'll be true. - You all know it don't matter none. - Oh, I know, I know. I just like to put ol' George on the spot. - Well, puttin' ol' George here on the spot is all well and good, but we got business to attend to. - Thank you, George. - You're quite welcome. - I was about ready for another round. - Thank you, George. - What? No brandy for me, George? I guess I should know when to keep my mouth shut. I'll just get my own if you don't mind. - Can we get back to business, gents? Federal government set aside this land for a new state capitol. They even got some damn Frenchy designing it for them. Now, we was the first people to settle here and I don't think we need no insiders coming in and telling us how to run our business. - [Eugene] That's right, John. We don't need no fancy-pants coming in here telling us how to run our business. What'd you have in mind? - Well, first off, I figure a proper name is in order. And I was thinking Indianapolis. - Indianapolis? We already names the state Indiana for the Indians and now you wanna name the state capital for them too. - Yes, I do. - Did your wife put you up to this, John? You lettin' her do your speakin' now? - Hey, at least she's an attractive woman. No offense, John. - None taken, Eugene. - Besides, if we was naming the city for your wife, we'd have to call it Fleshy-Homely-opolis. - Well, at least I got a wife, Eugene. - You sure do. She provides you lots of shade in the summer time. Hell, I don't need no wife. My nag looks better than yours. - Will you gladdies pipe down? If we call the city of Indianapolis it ain't gonna be the city of Indians. It's gonna be the city of Indiana. - Well, some people are wanting to call it Mile Square City and I, for one, am partial to that. (footsteps approaching) - Come on in, boys. - Sirs. Uncle, John. - Will you gents excuse me? I need to speak with my nephews. Reece, Keegan. - Sorry, sir. - I recently received a letter from my brother, Thomas, in Ohio and he stated his intention is to move here to Indiana with the rest of the family. Now, it would mean a lot to me personally and I'd give each of you boys $20 if you're willing to go to Ohio and help Thomas and his family move back here. - Well, heck, Uncle John, I got no problem fetchin' your brother. - Shoot, for $20, we'll tote him back over our shoulder. (laughing) - Well done, boys. - If we left first thing in the morning, would that be soon enough, Uncle John? - That'd be perfect. Now if you boys will excuse me, I've got some cackling hens to get back to. - [Keegan] $20. - Now, as I was saying, boys. Indianapolis is a combination of the state name and the Greek work polis, meaning city. Feds got the idea that there's gonna be settlers coming through here, going out west. Imagine settlers traveling on our roads. - [Eugene] John, we ain't got no roads. - You're so damn shortsighted, you can't see past your brandy sniffer. Now, I say Indianapolis, boys. Now, who's with me? - Aye. - [Eugene] Here here. - [All] Indianapolis. - [John] Indianapolis it is. (rain falling) (light piano music) - [Bethia] It's been nearly two weeks since Reece and Keegan left for Ohio. I'm sure a home cooked meal is all they can think about. Sadie's boy, Bobby Lee, he must be about 13 years old now. I wonder what he will think of his cousins. 13 is such an awkward age. Not quite a boy, not quite a man. I hope Reece and Keegan don't teach him all the wrong ways to be a man. We got some troubling news today. It seems that no one has seen or heard from George Pogue for a few weeks. And now it seems that they found a body that may be his just a few miles away from here, out near the Garfield's. I say maybe his because from what I've heard, there wasn't much of a body left. The locals Indians are saying that evil spirits killed him and feasted on his body, which is very unsettling. More than likely, he drank too much, had an accident, and the wolves and coyotes made a meal of the portly man. Still, just the thought of evil spirits is something I just don't care to think about. (light violin music) - Well, the way I figure, we shouldn't be more than two days from Thomas' farm. - Well, that's the best news I've heard in over two weeks. My arse is gettin' sour and I'm tired of eating beans. Can't wait for some of Sadie's home cooking. - What's the matter with my beans? - One, they ain't that good and two, they're a bit windy if you know what I mean. You're worse than the horse. (stirring) - [Sadie] That's a good lad. Go and fetch me a pail of water and tell your father breakfast is almost done. - Yes, mother. (light piano music) - [Bethia] It's been three weeks since Reece and Keegan took off for Ohio. I almost have Sadie's quilt done. It will be so nice to have the family all together again and another girl around, someone to talk to and someone who will understand how I feel. John and his friends are all good men, but still they are men and men never understand a woman. Men are only concerned with important matters, like building and figuring and drinking and fighting. I sure would like to see them tend to all their important matters without a woman around to cook and make a home for them. I guess important is all in the eyes of the beholder. - Father. - Yeah. - Can we talk? - What do you wanna talk about? - I'm of age now, father and I have helped you catch prey, but I've yet to make a first kill. - Maleck, there's much time for you. - Father. - Maleck, I do not speak of these things with the others, but you are nearly a man now and you must learn what it means to be Kala. To be Kala isn't something we chose. Tengre chose us to be Kala. And there are those among us who would not follow the old ways. And they have forgotten what it means to be Kala. Have you ever wondered why there have been no young born since you? Once we were many and we were feared, not for what we did, but for what we are. - What are we, father? - We are a proud people, proud of our calling, proud to do Tengre's bidding. But Tengre no longer favors us and many have become selfish. To them, being Kala only means taking pleasure in the kale and not in serving God. - I don't understand. - When the winter comes and mother Earth turns cold and dies, she doesn't fear the winter, but embraces it, knowing that this is the way that things ought to be. And that with each new ending, is a new beginning. So, it is to be Kala, we find pleasure in serving Tengre. And with each soul we send to him there's a chance for a new beginning. But we should not be prideful in our duties and we take pleasure in the suffering of those who encounter. We should not take selfish pleasure in the kill. The kill is what Tengre created us for and doing his work is what we should take pleasure in. Just like Winter takes no pleasure in the kill, but only knows that by doing what its created to do can mother Earth be born again. You understand? Do you understand? - Yes, I understand, father. - Oh, god is with you. Here in Oska, I'm informed that there is a family nearby with a boy your age. Turn to me. (choking) - Breakfast is ready. Go check on your boy. (ominous atmospheric music) - No, no. - [Woman] Set you her down. (eerie atmospheric music) (crying) (laughing) - You find the wrong pleasures in this, wife. - You're weak, brother. - [Man] This is not all right. Sadie, Sadie, are you okay? Who are you people? What do you want? Let her go. If you hurt her, I swear to god I will kill you. (whispering) - Hold his head back, open his mouth. (choking) (laughing) - You're gone. You can't help her now. (laughing) The more you move, the faster you are sleeping. (laughing) (choking) (grunting) - [Man] It's been a while since we've had a woman. - If Felix finds out about this, he'll have us whipped for sure. - I don't care what Felix thinks. (grunting) (eerie atmospheric music) I'd rather we be back in the old lands, facing the ax of the Beans. Be better than this slow march of death he's got us on. - You should feel privileged. Tonight you will reside with Tengre. Bring him, last for the Timber. (ominous cello music) - Your fate will be worse than the woman's. (chanting in foreign language) - Tonight, we offer this sacrifice to Tengre. Fire, you are a mother with 30 teeth. Take this offering to Lumia, that she may carry it to Tengre and that he may find it pleasing and bestow good fortune upon us. (rain falling) (ominous atmospheric music) - Tengre refuses our offering. - Tengre! - I don't like the looks of this. - Me neither. Keegan, keep your eyes peeled. (ominous atmospheric music) Thomas. - [Keegan] Reece, there's blood. - Sadie, Bobby Lee? Keegan, you go around back and I'll check out the inside. - All right. - Reece! (dramatic orchestral music) Is this where one of us is supposed to say a prayer? - I don't know any good prayers for this sort of thing. What are we gonna tell Uncle John about his family? - I don't know, but first we need to find out who's responsible for this. - You think it was featherheads? - No. I've never seen 'em do anything like this. - Well, the tracks by the house seem to suggest he was heading west. Let's see if we can pick up their trail. I haven't been sleeping for a week. - [Keegan] Me either. Every time I close my eyes, I see Uncle Thomas too. Oh, bloody hell, Reece. - It ain't me. It smells like death. Whatever it is, we gotta be getting close. (vomiting) God. Keegan, Why would someone do that to another man's legs. - Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to. - Let's go. (dramatic acoustic music) (heavy breathing) - Watch where you're chopping. You're getting blood all over me biscuits. I think we need some more fresh herbs. I think I'll go ask Victoria. - I was thinking of roasting some potatoes with these fleshy legs. It's Maleck's favorite. See if she has some parsley too. - That sounds delicious. - This is a special night for you, Felix. - Yeah, tonight we welcome another Kala into our clan. - I'm sure Maleck will make a fine warrior. - One day he'll take my place as I took my father's. - Well, hopefully not too soon. - Jaffa. Jaffa! Jaffa. Jaffa, what are you doing? That's way too big for fire. Put it down. Put it down. Let's go back to camp. (eerie atmospheric music) - [Victoria] Maggie, do you like the blonde mixed in my hair or do you prefer the red mixed in? - You're beautiful either way, dear, but I'm kind of partial to the red. (laughing) - Felix always loved yellow mixed in my hair, but all tonight is all about me, so red is shall be. You should do some red too. - That reminds me, Reuben sent me here to get some herbs. - I have some herbs right here. Tell Reuben it only takes a little bit of the parsley and if he needs anything else, he's welcome to come to me. - [Maggie] Thank you, I'll let him know. - Reuben, you have really outdone yourself this time. - It seemed like a special occasion. It's not every day you'll have a branding. - I remember my branding like it was yesterday. (eerie atmospheric music rising) - You know that question you asked me? - [Reece] Which one? - The one you don't want the answers to. - [Reece] Yeah. - I think we found our answer. - Are you saying that them people are eating that man's legs? - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. (eerie atmospheric music) - Maleck, are you ready? 'Cause there's no turning back once we've begun. Be mindful when you take the mark. Remain silent. You must remain silent. It is us who will scream the pain for you. We will let the gods know another Kala warrior is being born. I'll meet you by the fire. - Is Maleck ready? - Aye, he's ready. Are you? - [Man] We're all ready for this, Felix. - [All] Aye. - So, in the beginning it was Tengre who commanded us to wear this mark, the star representing the sky and the four lines, North, South, East, and West, representing the four families. As our Kala before us have taken this mark, so now comes another. (banging) (searing) (all screaming) (ominous atmospheric music) - You recall those chapbooks from when we were kids? - [Reece] You know I don't like to read. - No, you remember them. They were the scary ones, with the pictures. - [Reece] Yeah, I remember those. - Well, I recall one in particular, that Burton fella. He wrote of a man named Sonny Bean. Him and his family, they were infamous for killing, cooking, and eating other people. - [Reece] Eating? - Exactly like what we saw here today, brother. (eerie atmospheric music) The only person to ever live was a one-year-old little girl and she only made it to 12 before she started eating people. - [Reece] 12 years old? - 12. What's more unsettling than her age, is what she said right before they kicked the chair from beneath her feet. - What'd she say? - That id you knew what human flesh tasted like, you wouldn't be railing me thusly. (banging) - Oh god, no. No no no no. (ominous cello music) - After this morning meal, we shall leave this cursed place. - What are we gonna do with him? - Leave him for the crows. (fire sizzling) (light piano music) - [Bethia] I just finished the quilt I've been working on for Sadie and John and his friends have been clearing a little piece of land and saving the lumber, so Thomas can get a cabin built before winter sets in. That will surely be a tall task with just a couple of months to go before the weather changes. John's general store has been suffering as of late with all the time he spent preparing for his brother, but it's for a good cause and family is way more important than a general store. John, your nephews are here. - Whoa. - [John] Is Thomas with them? - No. And they look worrisome. - [John] Reece. Keegan. How you doing, boys? - [Reece] Sir. Right now, I'm telling you about a batch of things Keegan and I have seen on our travels to the house and back and now, well, we spied their cattle. - We seen their cattle, John. We went to get them. - And now, I'm gonna pull a symbol out of my pocket and show you they were actually like branding somebody. They wrote it down and just kind of scratched it out. They branded somebody with that. - We don't know 'em, but we should be able to track 'em by it, right? It's gotta be a brand from somewhere. - Bethia, we'll be having company for supper. - [Bethia] Yes, John. (ominous orchestral music) - John, you mean to tell me that they burned your brother and left him for dead and then they ate the rest of him? - Well, if these boys are right about what they seen, that's exactly what I'm saying. - Do you think we oughta call the militia? - No, Henry, we ain't gonna call the militia. There's a lot of people around here counting on this being the new state capital, all of us included. You and I both know that's never gonna happen if word gets out there's cannibals living around here. - Taking this kinda personal, Uncle John. - You're goddamn right it's personal, Reece. They murdered my brother, burned his body at the stake, and left it out for the crows to eat. Who knows what happened to his family. Now, I aim to get my vengeance with or without you, but I sure could use y'alls help. - I'm with you John. - Me too. - All right, let's pray. (ominous orchestral music) Lord, thank you for this food and the friends we have here to share it with us. I pray my brother, Thomas, is sitting by your side right now. I once heard a preacher say an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Bless me lord, that I may be the instrument of your vengeance. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me and my Kentucky Long Rifle protects me. - [Man] Mmm. - Now, I aim to exact a pound of flesh from these heathens, lord, and remove them from this place. And your will be done, I will send them all straight to hell. Amen. - [All] Amen. - Now, let's eat. (dramatic piano music) - [Bethia] It's with a heavy heart that I write tonight. I almost don't know how to write this, but Reece and Keegan returned home today. They were supposed to go to Ohio and help Thomas and Sadie move here to Indiana, but instead they brought ghastly news of Thomas and Sadie and their children's deaths and from the story they told, maybe all the rumors of evil spirits is right, because Reece and Keegan say they found Thomas' burnt body tied to a timber. And after they buried him, they followed tracks that led them to just east of here, where they found the body of a dead man, whose legs were missing and found a camp where they saw people eating that man's legs. I didn't hear everything, but they drew a symbol on a piece of paper that they gave to John and it must've been a very important symbol for these people, because Reece and Keegan said they saw these people branding a boy like he was cattle. - John was as hurt and mad as I've ever seen. He made plans to ride out with a few men to avenge his brother. I've never been one for vengeance, but if what Reece and Keegan said was true, then none of us are safe and these people need to be dealt with. (ominous cello music) - [Keegan] That ridge up there, that's where we seen 'em. (ominous atmospheric music) - So, what did you see, John? - Well, we seen one of 'em, tracked him from a distance. I got a pretty good look at their camp. Near as I can tell, there's six men, two women, and a boy. There's a couple of tents, so there may be more, maybe not. - So, what's the plan, John? - Well, Henry. You're a pretty good shot with this rifle. I want you to creep up close to their camp, wait till first light, you limber up that rifle and shoot the first damn thing that moves. Then you just reload and keep on shootin'. Keegan. - I'm good. It's more personal for me. (ominous cello music) - We'll come in from the side of their camp. When you boys hear that first shot, I want you to come in guns a-blazin'. Now, you all look out for each other. I done buried my brother and I don't wanna bury nobody else. Now, me, I'm gonna sneak up behind their camp. There's a bridge back there. Let's just see if any of them hear me with everything going on. (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) (grunting) - Felix. No. (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) - No! - I'm gonna carve my family's legacy into your flesh. (grunting) (grunting) (grunting and screaming) - What kind of savages are you? - [Felix] We're not savages. - People that eat other people are savages. - [Felix] We eat people because our god commands us to. - My god says that you're gonna pay for what you did to my brother and his family and my god is most generally right. (eerie atmospheric music rising) (heavy breathing) (ominous atmospheric music) - [Keegan] It's a fucking shame. - Well, boys, at 3:17, August 3rd, year of our lord 1820, we make a solemn vow amongst ourselves that once we leave this place, we never speak of what happened here again. Agreed? - Yes, sir. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Bethia] Everyone made it home safely, thank the lord. John told me that I can never speak of this to anyone, so I am writing what he told me in my diary. John said that they found the evil clan and that he and his men killed them all. I hope God forgives them, but it was necessary. He also told me that one of them told him that their god commanded them to do their evil. I don't know how any god could command people to do bad things. Nonetheless, John said that they burned all the bodies, so they won't be doing any more harm. If anyone reads this, take heed and be wary. (carnival music) - [Grandpa] So, we're gonna go and see... - [Cyrus] Can we have lemon shake-ups, grandpa, and corn-dogs and fried Snickers? - [Grandpa] And turkey legs if you want, but just don't tell your ma I let you spoil your dinner. Now, here's 20 bucks. Why don't you boys run and pick up some stuff. I'm gonna relax. (dramatic orchestral music) - Are you sure your husband's all right with me coming home with you? - Oh, we have an understanding. (eerie atmospheric music rising) Honey, I brought company home.
