Kappa A FILM BY TATUYA ISHII STARRING Takanori Jinnai Keisuke Funakoshi Ryuji Harada Masao Imafuku Jiro Sakagami Tatsuya Fuji Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming to the Y. Suzumori Exhibition. It has been fifteen long years since an exhibition by Yuta Suzumori, a.k.a. Y. Suzumori, has been held in Japan. In fact, this is his first trip back in ten years. He is, of course, here with us today. Please welcome Mr. Suzumori. During my thirty-year career... as a photographer... I have dedicated myself... to photographing human insanity... Easy for you to say! Who are you?! Isamu... No pictures! Glad you could make it... Shut up! Let him go. So after 15 years without a word, you're a celeb now! Let go of me! Let him go. He's my son. I'm not your son! Mr. Suzumori! Call an ambulance! Are you awake? Isamu, your father's come to. Go and see him. I'm leaving. Wait, your father... Mr. Sakuma! You're his agent. You know my reasons. You'll regret it! You're acting like a five-year-old! You aren't the only one who's suffered! Are you Isamu Suzumori? The name's Isamu Toda. Is he the son? Yes, he is. He's better, but still very weak. When did he last have surgery? His second operation was five years ago, I believe. Shrapnel is still lodged near his heart. It'll have to be removed. I'd like to operate immediately. Please do what you can. Excuse me. Isamu... Sakuma sent you an invitation, did he? I don't have... ...long to live. What is it you want from me? You look so much like her... For 15 years, I... Isamu, are you familiar with Kitagawa Village? I don't have time for nonsense! It's where I grew up. I want you to know what happened... When I was a young boy, I saw kappa there. SUMMER, 1953 Yuta! Tomorrow's summer break! What're ya gonna do? - What? - Don't know yet. Clear the road! Come see the movie! I wanna go! Won't there be lots of ghosts? Not ghosts, monsters. How's your pa, "Officer Sissy Cop"? Cut it out! You like outsiders, don't you, Katsuji? Do cops in Tokyo all wear smocks? Your pa might be a woman. He is not! Come, Katsuji... "The cop is a woman." Now say it. You will, right? The cop is...a woman! Give that back! Say hi to Sissy Cop for me! Yuta... Grampa! Let's go home. Why're you keeping this cucumber? Throw it away. Yuta, everything that grows in the garden is a blessing from heaven. Heaven? That's why everything is precious. You weren't born here, so you may not have heard... See that cave on Tenjin Pond? That's called Kawarashi Cave. The Guardian Kappa lives in there. The Guardian Kappa? When I was a kid, we'd all pray like this to Kawarashi Cave. Thanks to the Guardian Kappa, our village has never been short of water. Let's be going. I'm home! Just in time for supper! Wash up. Move quickly! Quickly, quickly! Grampa, do kappa die, too? I suppose they do. But after they die, kappa and humans go separate ways. When a male kappa dies, it becomes a spirit orb. And the female kappa becomes an aurora. Tonight we're having miso soup with turnip greens! It's your favorite, Yuta. Stop wearing that! Grampa first. Yuta? Kappa love cucumbers. Cucumbers? Grampa! Something's there! What? In Tenjin Pond! I saw it! Did you pray to Kawarashi Cave like I told you? Nothin' to worry about! The Guardian Kappa doesn't bother people. 'Morning, Yuta! Sorry about yesterday. Wanna see the movie? Pa gave me two tickets! Go on, Yuta. Let's go! I'll show you what a kappa can do! Laugh while you can! I'll be back with my friends! It won't change a thing! Just you wait! I love human blood... I'll suck the blood out of every Japanese alive! Delicious! They're like bugs flying to their death! Yo! What're you doing?! Close that! Okay... Welcome back, Gramps! Katsuji! Should you be here this late? Ma's gonna kill me! Better hurry. Can you ride, Katsuji? I'll have to! Take this. What's the bat for? In case of kappa. Don't be silly! Kappa protect our village. They'd never attack you! There's no need for a bat. But it's scary, so I'm bringing it. Really, Katsuji... You're such a scaredy-cat. Bye! Careful now! Kappa like to come out about now! Grampa can't make miso soup with turnip greens like your pa. Yuta... Every person has his station in life. There are tasks a person must do, and tasks that only that person can do. Understand? I don't! Try to sympathize with your father, Yuta. Officer! Katsuji's mother... Is my Katsuji here? He went home a while ago. Odd... He hasn't come home. He used our bike. He might've taken a spill. Let's have a look. Sorry to trouble you. I'll be right back. Officer... Your smock! Oh, right. Kat-Chan! Katsuji! Watch your step! Officer, over here! Kat-Chan! A kappa eye...! Kat-Chan! Calm down! A kappa! Don't excite the boy. Could it have been... ...a bear? A bear?! Yeah, the one we saw last year! I agree. Is that what it was, Kat-chan? Was it a bear? I'm so glad you're okay! Kat-Chan! Think! Was it really a bear? It was a bear! It had to be... This is trouble; there'll be other victims. Dear. No time to waste! We're going after it! I'm calling the men! This'll make you mayor.. It's been so long since we've hunted bear! Nice gun... Hey, thanks! Thanks for comin', Heikichi. Your old man's dressed up like a samurai again, Heikichi. He thinks he's some samurai hero. That's scary...' Wait, everybody! Wait, everybody! Wait, everybody! Shooting in the dark could be dangerous! Don't tell us villagers what to do. Put on your smock and go cook some miso soup! Got a problem with that? If it isn't the mayor... Out to see your mistress again? Shut up, stupid! What's going on here? Mosaku's Katsuji was attacked by a bear. Officer! Where were you when we needed you?! I'm sorry... Stop this foolishness, Mosaku! What do you mean? You all know a bear wouldn't come here! We don't expect you to help, Mayor. Shall we go? Hey, wait! Everyone! What're you looking at?! Officer! He's all talk and no action... A mayor needs to be a man of action! Agreed. A new gun is best. There you go again... Careful...No telling what might appear. You don't have to tell me! Stay alert and react quickly. Sadako!Zenji! We weren't doing anything! Why you.. What're you doing to my daughter?! Fire! Get away! I hardly touched her...! Dad! Dad! What's this...? You're caught in a trap... You'll burn to death. Dad! Dad! Something's there... It's the bear! That boar sure was big! Caught me by surprise! Good thing I flushed it out! You guys did squat! Hey, Yoshio, your new rifle wasn't any help at all. I only shoot at big game! Mosaku, that's one odd-looking bear... They call that a boar! Say, Heikichi, Why'd your old man try to let it escape? Now that you mention it... "Don't kill it!" he yelled. When I shot it dead, he stomped home, furious. My old man's going senile. No, you're the senile ones. Gramps! Mosaku... Hunters abide by a code. Never shoot young females! That boar never trampled our fields... Why'd you kill it?! If only I hadn't slept through it all... You have no respect for our village's guardian deities! Grampa... If you don't respect the Guardian Kappa, our village will be destroyed! Let's fix us some boar stew! What a beautiful day... Good heavens! It's no wonder the stream's not flowing... Who dumped all this here? This looks still usable. Stop it! That's not a police officer's job! Everyone's busy in the fields, so someone with idle hands needs to do this work. Officer! Was it here yesterday? It was here when the movie ended. Did you hear anything last night? No, not a sound. You're responsible for the place! What's going on here? Why'd you call me out here? I vowed I'd never go back to school again! Not even if Kinjiro Ninomiya himself...Oh my! It happened last night. Who did such a thing?! Who pulled such a malicious prank?! Somebody got something against education?! Oh, I get it... Officer, this might be the revenge of a student who got a lousy report card. A kid couldn't have done this. Then who did?! We don't know yet... We called you back to our village to prevent these things! Do something! Officer! Come quick! The watchtower is gone! Clear the path, Yuta! Here he comes. You sure took your time. The school statue's gone! Compared to the watchtower, that's a useless decoration! A village mayor needs to put the public good above all else! What'd you find? The marks exactly match the ones on the statue! But how was it out so cleanly...? A kappa?! Maybe. But they caught a boar. Was it really a boar you saw, Kat-Chan? I uh... That's Why... We need to check it out. Yuta...let's not! We'll be safe. Grampa said so, remember? But...that eye... Trust me! C'mon! Kappa... We're not supposed to go inside, Yuta. It'll be okay. But Ma said not to! Well, I am! Wait, Yuta! Aren't you afraid? Nope! Tie this there. Not that I'm afraid, but Ma said... Ma this, Ma that... I'm sick of that word! Don't get lost! Katsuji...that chicken. What's the big idea, Katsuji?! Hello there. What were you doing, Yuta? You won't get away with stealing our raft! What were you doing inside, Yuta? Say something, darn it! For an outsider, you're too darn cocky! He might tell the cop! He won't. Will you, Yuta? Let's go, guys. You okay, Yuta? You come, too! Is that your mother? What happened to her? Was it my bat...? I can't swim! Where are you from? The sky? Where're you going? I have important unfinished business. You know you're in no condition. You walked out on Mom and me the same way. Have you ever seen a kappa, Grampa? I did, too... in Kawarashi Cave. A father and his son. The son was about so big. His name's Skye. Are you listening, Grampa? Grampa...? Gramps! Pa... What's the matter? You just called Grampa, "Pa." He's my father. Oh... Let's go. It'll be just the two of us again. Dad, at Tenjin Pond... The temple hell is missing! How...?! This might be the Guardian Kappa's doing! Who just said such a stupid thing? This is the age of science. No such things as kappa! I wouldn't be so sure. You're saying kappa are real? They might exist. Don't be stupid! You believed in them, too, when you were a kid. This happened because you didn't do your job! He's right. Ever since you came, lots of strange things have been happening. So true! You wear such a fine uniform, but a scarecrow is more useful than you! Skye! Kappa...a kappa! The corner well bucket, honey buckets... Even the school statue. Damn! What's going on here? Kappa, they say! Dad... You're still up? At Tenjin Pond, inside Kawarashi Cave... Go to bed! But... You heard me! 'Morning! Thanks for coming. Great weather for a festival tonight! What'd you call us for, Mayor? We have the festival to prepare for, so keep it short. Anyone come? No. Are you... ...going to the festival tonight? Huh? Yes. I wish I could go with you, but I have my rounds. That's odd... Yuta, have you seen my flashlight? Last night, you mentioned something about... Tenjin Pond and Kawarashi Cave... Yuta? Where were you? I remembered something I had to do. More important than prayer? You're up to something, aren't you? I've done a lot for you... So tell me. Tell me! Skye... We can fool the Mayor, but not Mosaku. I told you we shouldn't have accepted money from both! Turning kappa into a tourist attraction will never work! Row faster! Don't scare me like that! Not yet, Zenji? This is where we worship the Guardian Kappa... Won't it be angry? Stop talking nonsense, stupid! Quit dawdling! Let's go, Heikichi! Don't say I didn't tell you so! Idiot! Let's not do this. If you two aren't coming, I'll go alone. I'm keeping all the money to myself! Hear something? Hang on, Zenji! Heikichi, get the raft! It's the Guardian Kappa's curse! Fellow villagers! Is everybody happy?! Why is the pond bubbling? The water's turning cloudy. A red kappa lies beneath... Everyone's waiting, Granny... Let's go to your new house. Granny! Did you hear me? Everybody else has already moved. Granny...This place is going to be a golf course. Let's go! What're you doing? What's the big idea? I'm talking to you! I... Who gave you permission? Stop it! Time to go, Granny. Stop it, I said! Cut it out! You don't have to worry... I just want a record. I said stop! What gives you the right?! Please forgive him! Who're you?! Granny! Finally decided to go? Got everything? She's leaving now. We're leaving, Granny. Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! What happened?! There really are kappa in Kawarashi Cave! Kappa did this to Zenji! I knew it! We'll capture them and put them on display! What do you all say?! I'll pay ¥5000 to the person who catches one! Wait! I'll pay double that! Did you really see a kappa? Not actually... Calm down, everyone! Let me, your police officer, handle this! We can't leave it to a good-for-nothing like you! Stay out of this! No, I won't! This is my duty! Officer! You abandoned your own village. You don't know how hard it is to be farmers! Right! You're fired! No! The festival is an important village event. So please remain calm... Shut up! If we don't go right now, the kappa will getaway! Listen up! Let's blast the entrance! We're hunting kappa...! Our village is going to change! What're we going to do, Masaru?! Shut up! Katsuji, it's your fault for mentioning the kappa! What'll we do? We're lost! Shut up! Stop crying! Anybody here?! Somebody! Hey! I had a dream... About Guardian Kappa... A female... Save our village. Officer! What happened to you? I'm in a hurry! Have you seen my Katsuji? Kat-Chan? My husband asked for the flashlight, but I couldn't find it anywhere. Katsuji must've taken it. Oh no! I need this What's wrong, Officer? Kawarashi Cave! Ko-chan is missing, too! They weren't spirited away, were they? Mosaku! Are you ready? Darn Mayor... Giving orders again! Not yet, Gonzo? Yuta! They're sure taking their time. Stay away from him, Sadako! Here's what we're going to do... We're going to blow up the entrance to Kawarashi Cave. Stay away from him! Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it! Wait! Out of my way! Done. Signal, Heikichi. The children are in there! Out of my way! What's all that noise? There are children inside! What?! Call it off! There's the signal. Damn you! Father! What's going on? Something's happened. Let's go see. Yuta...! Yuta! Yuta! Kat-Chan! Katsuji is inside! Not my Masaru, too? My Koichi, too? We have to get out! Look out! What's wrong? We have to hurry! You'll be killed! You have to get away! Skye... Why won't you come?! I'm going... You'll be killed! Yuta! Where are you?! Dad! Yuta! I'll come back to see you I promise! A promise, okay! Yuta, where are you?! Skye! Skye! I'm almost there! Dad... Dad! Guys. We're all okay! Am I glad I found you! Is everybody okay? Is that everybody? Officer, the rope's cut...! Stay calm and climb! Don't panic! Kat-Chan! Follow Yuta! Careful! Are you all right?! Hang in there! We're almost out! Get up, Yuta! We're getting out... Let's go! Are you all okay? Masaru! Good work, Officer! They're all safe! Hurry and get away! Go! I said 90! Dad! Go! Get away! Dad! Don't die! Dad! Yukichi! Get away, Yuta! Yukichi! You mustn't die, Yukichi! I'll get you out! Yukichi! Stay alive! Dad! It's too dangerous. Get away! Officer...! Yuta, look at your dad... He's gone to Heaven a hero! Dad... Dad! IN MEMORY OF OFFICER YUKICHI SUZUMORI WHO GAVE HIS LIFE IN THE LINE OF DUTY Grandpa's name was "Yukichi"? You named me Isamu after Grandpa... Dad... This is your grandson. Does it hurt? Where's your medicine? Wait here! Don't bother... I'm going... I'm going... You okay? I'm ashamed... ...of myself. Tell me one thing. What brought you back to Japan after all those years? Eyes... Lovely eyes I saw through my lens... ...of a Palestinian girl. The eyes of a child with no country... no family to return to. Eyes that saw right through my self-righteous attempts to capture human insanity. I grew tired, very tired. Tenjin Pond...' Howl longed to return here. It's okay... Skye...! You're alive! We've both...aged. The place...is a mess. Oh this... It's not working anymore. Were you waiting these forty long years? You waited? Forgive me. Forgive me... Dad! Get a hold of yourself! Try to hold on, Dad... Isamu, I. Could never say what was most important to the most important person in my life... Forgive me... Dad! Dad! Dad... Yuta... ♪ Now that we're apart, I sometimes wonder to myself ♪ ♪ How are you doing? ♪ ♪ How wonderful it would be ♪ ♪ If you've kept your smile ♪ ♪ After we parted, I pondered the question, ♪ ♪ What is kindness? ♪ ♪ But not about anyone in particular ♪ ♪ Because love resides within ourselves ♪ ♪ I kept my faith... ♪ ♪ I hoped and waited, ♪ ♪ But as time flawed by, ♪ ♪ My cries into the darkness ♪ ♪ Became only a lonely wind through my heart ♪ ♪ Even the faintest memory of you ♪ ♪ Makes me wonder... ♪ ♪ So I kept writing this letter ♪ ♪ Even though I knew it would never reach you ♪ ♪ The love I could once hardly suppress ♪ ♪ Is now just a fond memory ♪ ♪ Of the days when we both knew ♪ ♪ We were meant for each other ♪ I'll never forget...
