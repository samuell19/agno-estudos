Okay. Tell me what you're tasting. Cherry, raspberry, and what is that? Spice and tobacco. - Exactly. You nailed it. - Ah. It's a red burgundy, but to me, it's a passport to a travel experience. You know, I'm suddenly transported to a chateau garden outside of Dijon on a warm Autumn day. Smart of you to fly up. Mythos Wines was almost off my list. Speaking of, I'm so sorry the previous wine rep went MIA. I will personally handle your account from now on. Good. Stay for lunch. Hand-torn pasta with porcini and herbs. Oh. You're evil. I wish. I have to catch a flight back to L.A. in… oh, now. When are you gonna stop racing around California 24/7, putting out fires for your boss? Ugh, Calder's not that bad. Okay. Yeah, he is. He's terrible, but I'm angling for Regional Sales Director. I would like to see Lola Alvarez running her own show, with her own wine import company. So, just got back from my Sydney house. Uh-huh. Tried some new wines by Hazel Vaughn. - Oh, Hamish, no, not another... - I know. I know. Another Fortune 500 CEO with a vanity wine label. Just try it. It's a pétillant naturel wine. The ancient technique. Ooh. Bubbles before it's bottled. Mm-hmm. Hazel doesn't have a US importer. If you get Mythos a contract for Vaughn Wines, I'd put it on my list for all of my restaurants. Well, if Ms. Vaughn's office isn't available, I'll leave word. Okay. Are you ready? 310-555-0143. Thanks. Okay. - Hi. Oh… - First-Class souvenir. I am so jealous of your life. I just ate lunch from the vending machine. He's on a tear today. He even made the FedEx lady cry. Ramona? Who makes Ramona cry? I know. I've been on the phone with Kroger all day. They stocked our Lone Elk Merlot on the bottom shelf. Okay. Nobody looks at the grocery store bottom shelf. Eye-level only. I got creative. I traded them a multi-case discount on Pink Lady Rosé for a better facing. Daryl from Kroger was all over it. I'm pretty sure he thought it was his idea. Nice work, girl. Love it. I took a page out of the Lola playbook. Remember we love our jobs. May I remind you this is a place of business, not a Chuck E. Cheese? Oh. Lola, update me on the King account. Saved it. And our Burgundy was successfully added to his wine list. You know me, go big or go home. That's why you're my number one. If only everyone was as motivated. Ow! I want new ideas at the town hall tomorrow. No resting on laurels. Oh, no. I know. I hate laurels. Ugh. Oh, I'm actually gonna be late. I finally scored a sit-down with Wine Barn. Fine. Just, uh, don't pitch me any of that all-female Uruguayan wine collective nonsense again. I know it's small batch, but it's these really incredible women who... I'm in the wine business, not the whining business. Oh… He's gonna fire me. I can feel it. Okay, okay. Deep breaths. Here we go. Okay, you have an entire night to find something to pitch. - Yeah. Okay. - Don't worry. Oh, uh, one second. Okay. Lola Alvarez. A month? Well, can I schedule a meeting for when Ms. Vaughn returns? Yeah, I'll send over materials. Okay. Great. Sounds good. Speak soon. Thanks. Yes. That sounded big. What's up? Oh… Oh. Come on, work wife. Spill. Okay. Vaughn Family Wines. Out of Australia. Started as a celebrity label made at a custom crush facility. But now Hazel Vaughn has her own vineyards and brought in an award-winning winemaker. What? Sweet find. Uh, how… how can I help? Right now, Hazel's on sabbatical for a month, so just keep this between you and I until I get a meeting set. Okay. Thanks. Gotta run. One last client drop-in until I'm faced own on my couch in sweatpants. That's good. Get on in here. Made pizzas from scratch. We got leftovers. Hey, Dad. Hello. So, what is the neighborhood book club pretending to discuss this month? Oh, honey. You know we only walk over to Carlos's for the free rosé. Mm. And we are loving this one. Oh, I can see. You guys work fast. Mm. Deep gratitude for the wine hookup. Mm. Speaking of hookups, spill. Oh. Come on, we've already finished the other gossip. Here we go. Can't you just discuss my love life behind my back, like normal people? - Uh, no. - No. - We can't do that. - No. Not our style. No. How long since that divorce, Lola? Um, two years. Why? Who's counting? Me. Grand kids don't make themselves. Oh, Dad, really? What? Honestly we're gonna go there tonight? Sweetie, while not subtle, book club has a point. Tyler let a damn good thing go. It's time to move on, like he did. Tyler didn't turn out to be the person that I thought he was. Okay? Not every man is a liar. Look at me. I'm perfect. You always see the best in people. Don't stop now. Your heart got broken, you pressed pause on your love life. It's time to press play. You got to learn to trust again. I project a year-over-year increase in sales, placing these wines in… - Excuse me. - …upscale restaurants… - Hi. - …and specialty bottle shops. Plus, the Australian government offers a substantial financial package, um, to export, so it's a win-win. In summation, Calder, I have secured you a pitch meeting four weeks from today with Hazel Vaughn herself. Hmm. You got a passport, Audra? Mm-hmm. Yep. You're coming to Sydney with me. Close this deal, we're talking Regional Sales Director. Oh. Uh, short break, everybody. I gotta take this. I… I didn't… Sugar-pops, I got the opera tickets. Okay, ciao. Vaughn Family Wines is my find. Well, Audra pitched it and now it's hers. Okay, only because I told her about it. Well, that was your big mistake now. Wasn't it? We learn lessons the hard way, Lola. Lola's up next, everybody. Let's go. This should be good. Hmm? You know, it's no secret you're not the most warm and fuzzy boss, Calder. But hey, I get it. You know, wine is a tough business, and I told myself you were setting a high bar for good reason. But nope, turns out you are a garden-variety snob. You mistake cruelty for cleverness. When it comes to wine, you barely know a Petit Verdot from a Petit Syrah. You're not fooling anyone. Don't be emotional, Lola. If this is about the Regional Sales Director position... Audra can have it. I've been saving your butt for years. I'm done! What are you doing? Oh, isn't it obvious? I'm quitting. Uh, no, you can't leave. I decide when someone leaves. Oh. Not today, pal. You fall straight into the category of "life is too short." You know what? I would rather sell margaritas in a can at a suburban 7-Eleven than work another minute for you. Bye, hon. Good luck finding someone else's ideas to steal. Take care, team. Oh, and, uh, I have a stash of Girl Scout cookies in my bottom desk drawer, so parting gift. Bye. - Morning. - Morning. Oh. Who knew quitting would be so inspiring? And terrifying. It's a really interesting combo. Okay. How is this for my new company logo? - Wow. - I sketched it last night. - I love it. - Really? It's barely day one of your own company and you're already crushing it? I'm proud of you, sweetie. It's time. Use a coaster. Thanks, Dad. But so far my company is just an elaborate doodle and some lovely Uruguayan ladies. And with my savings on the line, I really need a big account ASAP. I need Vaughn Family Wines. Uh-oh. I know this tone of voice. Hold on to your butts, everyone. - Calder's meeting's in four weeks. - Mm. I did some Internet sleuthing. That sabbatical Hazel's on? She spends every year at her family's sheep farm in Australia. Like a "stay in touch with her roots" kinda thing. Hazel Vaughn's farm also… [keyboard clacking …has an Airbnb cottage. Yeah. I'll rent the cottage, and pitch my company to Hazel first. Boom. It's a matter of principle now. Wow. Australia! That sounds kind of far. Yeah. I know. Gah. Is this too bold? I don't know, like, am I brave or just, like, really crazy? Is your gut telling you to do this? Yes. Strangely, it just… It feels right to me. Then I say, let's go a lot of bold and a little crazy. I'm going to Australia! Welcome. Well, good morning, Australia. Hi. Let me help you with that. Thanks. Woah! Oh my God. Are you all right? Gravity. Oh. I'm all good now. And time to go. - Where to, mate? - Take me to the pub, my good man. Hello? Anyone here? Hello? Uh, where do I check in? Wow. Oh! Hi. Can I help you find something? Combination to the safe maybe. Yes. De... No! No, no, no, no. No. I'm sorry. No combination needed. That will not be necessary. Hi. I, um… I… I booked the Airbnb. Yeah, I figured. I've been expecting you. Just not here. Oh. Weird. So you're saying that this isn't the cottage that I rented, huh? Whoo. Imagine that. All right. If there's nothing else on your "breaking and entering" agenda, let me show you to your slightly more modest lodging before the boss gets home, okay? Oh, wait. If by boss you mean Hazel Vaughn, could you, um, help a girl get introduced? Uh, right. That's why you're snooping around her house. - Um, not snooping. Sure. - Come on. Let's go. Someone like me needs to get creative to score face time with the Hazel Vaughn. Come on. Please? Charm doesn't work on me. Look, enjoy the cottage. Take some selfies with the sheep. Just don't bother Hazel Vaughn. Excuse me. Mate, we got issues. Miss. That new jackaroo Peter? He's just quit. Done. It's not like that bludger did any work. I always had to send him off to sober up under a tree. Oh, but I saw that guy. He took my airport van to the pub. That sounds about right. I've been calling everywhere. No one has any workers to spare. Not even a bloody backpacker. Anyway, gotta get back to the sheep. Righto. Let's get you situated, right? Hey. Stop. Hi. Hi. Lola Alvarez. I am very excited about your wine, Ms. Vaughn. And since you're only considering American importers personally, I figured a self-made lady boss would appreciate another self-made lady boss... - Sorry, Hazel. She's... - Not done talking. My company, Salud Imports, is a newly established California importer... I've never heard of them. How new? So far, it's only me. And I'm still in the process of getting licensed. - Doesn't that take months? - 60 days. And I can also guarantee placement with the world-famous chef Hamish King. Whoa. Let me stop you right there. Despite the ambush, I admire your moxie. And Hamish King is an impressive name-drop, so I'll be just as straight with you in return. You've clearly done your research. Vaughn Family Wines is my baby, so there is absolutely no way I will go with a first-time importer. Sorry you wasted an airline flight. Yeah, look, while I got ya, bad news. Jackaroo bailed on us today. - It's shearing season. - Yeah. Same as neighboring stations. - Everyone's shorthanded. - Well, I… I could do it. Could do what? The job. I mean, how long do you need someone? A few days? About two weeks. Also, no. Well, why not? I'm here and I'm willing. I can be your jackaroo. Yeah, nah. You'd, uh… you'd be a jillaroo. Gendered terms. Cute. Whatever works. Look, we need someone with real station experience, not an Airbnb tourist. Look, I came all this way to show Ms. Vaughn I go the extra mile. This is the extra mile. I'm a hard worker. And I will hit the ground running, just as I will when I'm working with your wine. Well, a pair of hands is a pair of hands. If Max here agrees. He's this station's boss cocky, so what he says, goes. You will never have to send me off to sober up under a tree. I pay attention. I can't believe it's come to this. Looks like your lucky day. And since my sabbatical always includes endless work calls, Max here will be in charge of training you starting today. Today? No. I can't spend the next two weeks babysitting some newbie. That's busy farm life for you. - Yeah, Tim can do it. - The person I trust is you. I hope you're worth the trouble. Lola Alvarez, give us all you've got. If you pass muster at mustering, then we can talk wine. Deal. Thank you. Yes. Might as well get started then. - Wait, like, right now? - No time like the present. Well, I mean, Don't I need to drop my bag off at the cottage first? Leave it. And no more cottage. Workers stay in the shearers' quarters. Well, I… I mean, I can't just leave my bag here. What if it gets stolen? We're 200 kilometers away from anything. Who's gonna steal it? Wait. What? Uh… Sheep pens. Shearing shed. When you're running livestock, you wanna make sure they're safe, fed, you know, watered. Keep up on diseases and pregnancies. Sounds like things get pretty wild here on a Saturday night. Yeah. Uh, so, during the season, we shear about 500 sheep a day. Ah. Okay. So that's where the action happens. Uh, yeah, nah. You won't be doing any sheep work. That's for the experienced hands. Okay. So, what will I be doing? Chores. Grunt work. Hard yakka. Hey, you volunteered for it. Not complaining. I love grunt work. Whoo! Bring it on. That's good to hear. We'll start you off with some fence mending. We have kangaroos out here, constantly making holes. Kangaroos? Like, boing-boing ones with pouches? Will I get to see some? Yeah. That "boing-boing one" will kick you flat on your back. What about koalas? Uh, they scratch. Huge claws, like this. Oh. So disappointing. Do you have to burst every bubble? Maybe. Hey, don't... Lazza, don't. - Lazza, don't keep... - Oh. Lazza, don't quit on me here. Come on. Busted radiator. Gotta walk back. Wait. Can't you call a tow truck? Yeah, nah. There's no reception out here. Oh, great. Station life is unpredictable. As they say, "If you jump in the saddle, be ready for the ride." - Was that a cowboy wisdom quote? - Stock man. No cowboys here. Then what's a jackaroo? Well, it's technically a cowboy, but it's a term for newbies like you. - Are they all you got? - My ankle boots? Uh, um… - Oh, I have sneakers too. - Oh, that's no good. - Flip-flops? - It's rough land out here. You'll need Blunnies to protect your feet. And you didn't even bring a hat. It was kinda supposed to be a two-night stay. - Right. - You guys got a gift shop? That's very funny. - Here. Take mine. - Oh! No, no, no. Okay. Oh, right. Well, then, thank you. This is… This is fine. I'm fine. Well, you won't be in an hour or so. Australian sun shows no mercy. We'll start back training tomorrow. This is gonna be fun. What? Sixty days, huh? - To get my wine importer's license? - I pay attention. Huh. Yeah. There's no way Hazel's gonna go for a company that doesn't exist yet. You do realize how absurd that is, right? Well, sometimes you have to take risks. Believe in yourself. You know, go big or go home. Yeah. Well, good on ya. But I wouldn't get my hopes up. Okay. Well, thank you for the encouragement. I'm just being practical. Practical isn't really my style. Is it always so hot here? Nah. Gets heaps hotter in the arvo. - Arvo? - Means "afternoon." Who's the one who lives in the van? No. The blonde one from last Saturday. He's the only shaggable man within 200 kilometers. This is why I'm glad I'm not single. Hi. Lola from L.A. Your new roomie. Hi. Oh, impromptu mobile office. I got a Skype-date with Heidi. Yeah. Lockie hasn't messaged me back since Tuesday. He's definitely ghosting me. Ugh, men. I'm Breeze. And don't worry about them. Takes a while to earn their trust. Oh. Yeah, I'm only here for two weeks. I'm not trying to steal their jobs, so… Reckon that airport van'll be back here in no time. Bet you ten bucks she doesn't last the week. Deal. Um, sitting right here. Just... Oh! Oh no! Somebody used all the hot water! - What? Are you kidding? - Are you serious? Sorry. It was a 14-hour flight. I really needed that long shower. Heidi. Hi, baby. Hey. How you going? I'm good. Tired. You look amazing. - No… - Oh, come on. Well, that is just brilliant. Sorry. Chores don't do themselves, Big Smoke. Here you go, Henry. Today's riddle. Oh, not this again. Every damn morning. Gotta keep you on your toes. What ship has two mates but no captain? - Like a canoe? - Nah. No, like a kayak with, like, two seats. Oh, thank you. - Titanic. - That doesn't even make sense. A submarine? Sorry, sir? Excuse me, do you have any other coffee options, like a latte or an espresso? You're joking. Right? Okay. I can work with this. No worries. Oi, over here. We saved you a seat. You guys are, uh, talking to me now? Uh, well, Breeze was right. We can be a bit too hard on the newbies. Yeah. We were just pulling your leg last night, that's all. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Morning. Oh, don't. You two are terrible. Leave her alone, the poor thing. - Best prank ever. - It never gets old. Bit of a friendly hazing. Should've warned ya. - We all get it on our first day. - Yeah. Female friendship is overrated. I got it! The riddle. A relationship. Yeah. We have a winner. - Oh. - Oh. First prize, an extra snag from Dan no here. - I'm getting it tonight. - Morning. - Hey, boss. - Morning. - You ready to get started? - Yeah, let's do it. Right, so you bend this. Like that. Okay. Feed this through here, right? Then you twist it. You twist that back. Then you twist that back through there, and then you… Right, okay. - Like that. See? - Yeah. - So you hold this and pull down. - Uh-huh. - And that's it. Done. - Oh. Show me again. - Seriously? - Just... Last time, I swear. This is the one. Huh. A week ago, I was pouring a Cabernet for the sommelier at the Ritz-Carlton. And now, I'm pouring sheep food. What happened? Oh. Hey, girl. Somebody looks hungry. You ready to eat? Okay, then. You got it easy, sister. Waited on hand and hoof. Bon appétit, whoever you are. Wait. Who are you? You need a name. Come on. Oh! No, no, no, no! Stop. Stop it. Don't do that! Just spit balling here. Uh, Meryl Sheep? Just... That's it! Don't... Uh, Calista Flockhart? Yup. Good boy. Okay. - Hey. You're mixing up the mob. - What? You see the different colored tags here? Oh. You better get to re-sorting the sheep. They're not gonna sort themselves. Yeah, okay. All right. Listen up, guys, okay? No mingling. Hey! Hello? Hello? Pay attention. No, no, no. Wait, hey, do you have wool in your ears? What the flock. No. I've got it. You are a grand dame. A diva. You are Baaabra Streisand. I like you. Move it. Move… Thank you. Stay. Stay. Okay. Wait, no. Okay. Um, cool. Ugh. Ugh. Oh. Your boots are amazing. I should've consulted you before I packed. - Um, speaking of… - Mm-hmm. …on the plane I read in Wine Spectator that you like unique wines. And there's this all-female collective out of Uruguay doing amazing stuff. I could, uh… I could arrange for them to send you some bottles. I'm busy with station work. You should be too. - Why is this so hard? - Yeah. Well, station life is tough. Can't wine and dine your way out of problems. Oh, that's what you think I do all day? Well, isn't it? Well, technically, yes. - Huh. - But I'm a self-starter. Number one at Girl Scout cookie sales three years in a row. High school valedictorian. Nailed my sommelier exam at age 22, which is basically unheard of. And I do the New York Times crossword puzzle in ink. I do not fail. I've got this. Well, a stubborn horse walks ahead of the herd. Where do you get these quotes? Pinterest? Huh. Ah? Ah? - Hey, hey! Stop! Stop! - No. I'll fix it. I just need to get the plow! Brown snake! It's a brown snake. Oh. Extremely deadly. Okay. Well, uh… Oh, you leave 'em be, they'll leave you be. Getting closer and closer. - Can you believe it? - Yeah, can't wait. I'm so excited. Love you, Heidi. Take care of our bean. Love you too. Sam's partner Heidi is up the duff. Like Hilary? Like pregnant. Due next month. Ah. What? Congratulations. Yeah. Campfire time. Oi. - Hmm? Yes. - Let's get some coldies. - Breeze. - Yeah, coming. Oi, newbie. I noticed the dunny's looking pretty scungy. So… Sorry, I should've warned ya, again. Newest jillaroo gets toilet-cleaning duty. Ugh. And so, we repurpose sheep manure into fertilizer. It's all part of keeping War at ah green. Okay. The, uh, eco-friendly aspect of this farm got a lot less appealing. Yeah. So shovel that into the spreader. We're gonna need 20 loads today. Twen...? Oh… Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. No. Oh, that was terrible. Nope, nothing. Okay. How's it going with the American? Uh, she has spirit, I'll say that. Uh-huh. Translation, she's useless? Well, uh… Hi there. Hi. Here I am. Hard at work. Whoa! Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. I, uh… I saw this whole thing going differently. Haze, you all right? Wait, no. Wait, I'm sorry. Uh, wait, wait. No, I'm sorry. Whoa! Whoa! Where are you going in such a rush? L.A. Tell Sam she won the bet. Come on, Lola. Don't go. It's been five days. It took me months to find my groove here. I don't have months. This was always a pipe dream. There's no way I am recovering from today. Any tips on how to hail a taxi? Nah, they take forever and cost a fortune. Max is heading into town though. Yay. Hey, Arlo. Can I hitch a ride? Yep. Ugh. Lazza, you rotten old bastard. Seriously? Again? I'll motorbike back from the station with tools. Let's go. Ugh. - Arlo! Come here. - Dressed for success, as always. You know what? I think this is a sign. Australia hates me! Hate's a pretty strong word. You know, I've never quit anything. Ever. Never mind bold and crazy, I went too big and now I'm going home. Hey, where's that spitfire who blew in, determined to do business with the Hazel Vaughn, huh? She was gutsy. Time for her to pack it in, mate. I don't know. It's not every day a Fortune 500 CEO gets sheep dung sprayed all over 'em. That really cracked me up. Well, I'm glad that I could amuse you. Wait a second. Was that a smile just then? Oh, come on. You're halfway there. No. I see what you're doing and I will not fall for it, pal. Okay? - Let me wallow in self-pity. - See, now you're talking. You just gotta get one side of your mouth up and then the other side... - And then you got a full smile. - Stop. Stop! You are a horrible man. I know. I know. It's one of my better qualities. Oh. I, uh, heard you talking to Hazel before. You were about to agree with her that I am useless. Uh, I was about to tell Hazel that you have promise. Because you do. You know, when it comes to the hard work, some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all. Huh. You really do have a thing for inspirational quotes, don't you? You turned up, Lola, and you didn't turn up your nose. That's worth a lot in my book. And Hazel's too. Wait. You told me not to get my hopes up when it comes to Hazel. I dunno. Maybe… Maybe you're onto something about taking risks. Look, it's not like you'll make your flight now, so just think on it overnight. Okay, what now? Uh, nothing. I'm just curious. Why wine? My, uh… My dad worked his butt off to support the two of us. He went from selling insurance door-to-door to setting up his own shop. He was the OG bad ass. My mom was never really in the picture, so, you know, my dad's my hero and role model, and I just figured I'd follow him into the insurance biz. And then, in college, I was, um, I was waitressing at this upscale L.A. steakhouse, and… and one night the Wine Captain didn't show up for his shift. So, I winged it and nailed it. Hmm. I… I had a knack for telling a wine's story. The magical places it'll take you. I'd found my thing. That's a good feeling to have. - I think he agrees. - Yeah, he likes that. Having a, uh, lie-in, ladies? Hmm? I, uh, fixed the hot water issue. My dad's house has a tricky boiler too. Dibs on the first shower. You go, girl. Whoo-hoo! I reckon we're about the same size. Um… Yeah, and I've got a spare pair of Blunnies too, so… Thanks, but why? You proved us wrong, mate. I lost the bet. Welcome to the crew. And thanks for putting a tenner in my pocket, making Kylie a loser. Yes, yes. Anyway, the shoes are a loan, so I expect them back and in perfect condition too. You got it. Oi. What has a ring, but no finger? Ah. They charge six dollars for this in L.A. It's called a pour-over. - Six bucks? - Mm-hmm. I gotta get a new job. Hey. - Newsflash. - Mm-hmm. I'm staying. So our efforts to run you off, they failed? Hmm? I did some light reading last night. Heard of her? Sybylla Vaughn? - Uh, yeah. The name does ring a bell. - Okay. I'll summarize. Sybylla is the OG outback bad ass. She is a widow who blazed her own trail, founding War at ah with nothing but grit and determination. She's a true pioneer. Like you? Sybylla wasn't a quitter, and neither am I. Any questions? Uh, not really. Nah. I researched and edited the book myself, so… What? You couldn't interrupt my monologue with that vital information? No, it was too much fun to watch. Hey, uh, you should open that. Mysterious box. Sybylla would believe a proper jillaroo, which you are now, deserves a proper hat. Also, I really need my favorite back. You already knew I was staying? Uh, no one can resist the wisdom of my inspirational quotes. - Admit it, you get 'em on Pinterest. - That's highly classified information. Ooh. A man never reveals his secrets. Hmm. - Audra! - Yes? Why is every single one of our accounts in trouble? Oh, um, maybe the workplace culture thing? Drive to La gun a now and fix this. Oh, Calder, I am on it. - Well, get more on it! - Sorry. Lola would already be doing 80 on the 405. Yes. Okay. Oh, uh… Go. Right, so, I was up before dawn, and I'm shoveling out a shed full of sheep manure, and, uh, someone jumps in the shed and starts shoveling next to me. Uh, it's so dark, I couldn't see who they were. Anyway, we finished the job, step outside, and then as the sun's coming up, in the dawn light, I can see it's a woman. And then it just hits me, hey. Like, yeah. I think I'm in love. Are you not chained to your lap pie tonight? Oh. Well, with all this merriment going on, I mean, how's a girl to concentrate? Stubbie? I'm actually more of a, uh, Bordeaux Blanc type. Ah, served chilled around eight degrees Celsius. - Mm. - Yeah. Nah, we're fresh out. Oh, look at that. Someone knows wine. What the heck. When in Rome. Or, you know, the middle of nowhere. So, the, uh, boss cocky has hidden talents? I've heard you. You're not bad. Hmm. Go on. Keep going. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Almost. But now we're back. That's true. Everybody! Louder! Okay, slow it down. - Yeah! - That was so good! Good job. Okay, Big Smoke! Not bad. Come on. Stop. Keep going. Mmm. What exactly is Vegemite? Leftover brewer's yeast. Oh. Seriously? - Yeah. - Hmm. So interesting. Hey, look, what's going on over there? - What? - I think Max needs you. - He's all right. - So Henry, tell me. Why the life of a shearer? I like the freedom. You know, you're always moving around, you work with the same mates job to job. Hmm. Look, I can shear hard for a couple months and have time off, family, go fishing. Just take it easy, you know? It's not like one of them office jobs where you go chuck a sickie for a day off. Hmm. Work-life balance. Huh. I always thought that was an urban legend. Maybe you'll learn it here. Yeah, maybe. I'm trying. Baaabra sends her love. And I won't bother asking what book you're discussing tonight. John and Diane only show up for gossip on this Max guy. Tell us everything. Spare no details. Did you get it, girl? Okay. Great talking to you, guys. Love you. Bye. Oy, does he have a six pack? - Hey. - Hi. So, uh, Sam had to go to the doctor with Heidi, which means you're finally going to do sheep work today in the shearing shed. Wait, I'm sorry. Did… did I just get a promotion? Well, you can call it that if you like. Yes! Amazing. Okay. Is Hazel gonna be around today too? Get to see my promotion in action? Uh, no. She went to Sydney overnight to visit her boyfriend. Oh. So, what is your deal with Hazel? Uh, she's fine. It's… it's complicated. Okay. Let's go. Okay. Uh, let me just give Baaabra some water first. Uh, Who-bra? Oh. Baaabra. I, uh… I named her. Lola, it's a big mistake. You never name 'em. - Well, you named your truck Lazza. - Yeah. It means Larry. You know, Larry's a solid bloke. He's… …he's a reliable mate. I mean, is he really that reliable? And why is Baaabra stuck in solitary? Uh, she's CFA. Cast for age. She's, uh… She's dinner next Sunday. What? No! No, no, no. We're… We're great friends. She gives great advice. She's deeply wise. It's just the way it is with old-timers. Hey. Don't worry, Baaabs. I will spring you from Death Row. I promise. Ducks on the pond! - Oh? - It's an old-school saying. It means there's a lady coming into the shed. Ah. Hey. That's no lady. That's our Lola. Aw. She'll show you what to do. - Okay. Got it. - Go have fun. Go. Lola, grab us another fleece. - Okay, uh… - Now! Run! - Like now? - Right now! Go! - Okay. I'm… Okay. I'm gonna go this way. - Let's go! Pick up the pace, Lola. Here we go. Now let the fleece fly. Let it go from the bottom, flick it out. Yeah, nah, that's not it. But that's all right. No. Now! Run! Now! Right now! You gotta flick it out. - Yeah. That's a little better. - Really? Yeah. You're getting better. That's good. - Okay. - That's good. Since Lola quit Mythos, I'm overseeing your account now. I can offer you a multi-case discount on Spotted Duck Merlot. I don't do wines with animals as their logo. - Or Merlot. - Oh. Uh, I could offer you a Syrah... I'll wait for Lola to get back from Australia and see what her new company has to offer. Australia? Ooh. Hello? I'm sorry. Nail art happening here. Don't make me start over. The last time I shag a bartender. You know, he's definitely ghosting me. Oh, hell no, sister. No bartenders. Trust me. I'm divorced from one. Okay, spill, sister. - Oh. It's not very juicy. - Go on. Okay. I… I got married when I was young. He was handsome. I was in love. I had landed my first wine rep job. He had dreams of opening up his own bar, but as I worked my way up the corporate ladder, Tyler worked his way through the cocktail server staff. Ugh. What a knob. I learned the hard way. Once bitten, twice shy. We hate him. - Me too. Ugh! - Well, good. Heidi's fine. False alarm. Good. You missed Big Smoke here in action today. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Henry said she was a real ace. Looks like you are trying to take our jobs after all, Lola. I mean… - Teeth time? All right. - Yeah. - Okay. Be careful, they're still drying. - Yup. - So, just blow. - Okay. I might try and, uh, give Heidi a call before she goes to sleep. Yeah. Okay, I will get some air and give you some privacy. Okay? Yeah. Thanks, Big Smoke. You contemplating more trespassing? Looks like you're the one trespassing. Isn't this Hazel's pool? Uh, she never goes in and someone should use it. Besides, Hazel's in Sydney. Hmm. The water's nice. Come in. What, like, go swimming? With you? Yup. What are ya? Chicken? Is that a dare? Well, that depends on whether you take it or not. Well, in that case, dare accepted. Ooh. I can see why you sneak in here. Well… Don't splash me. Never even dream of it. See you. Hey, Breeze. I need you to muster today. All right? Hazel's on calls all day. I promised Tim I'd help him stack bales. Sorry. Take Lola instead. Yeah. I'm not too sure motorbikes are Lola's thing. Oh, come on. I think she's full of surprises. Well, breaking her neck needn't be one of them. She's been here almost a fortnight. Have a little faith. Go get it, girl! Try to keep up! - Go! - I'll watch out behind. Whoo! This way, come on. Keep it moving. All right. - A little adventure over lunch? - Okay, sure. You ride like a pro. My ex was a motorbike guy. At least I got that out of the marriage. Whoo. Where are we? That's Sybylla's favorite spot. Is this that work-life balance thing that Henry spoke so highly of? She called it Eden Falls. Yeah. I came here a lot as a kid. Oh. So, you're a local boy? You, uh, grew up near War at ah? Uh, sorta. What? I'm sorry, no, you are not getting away with a non-answer answer. You know basically everything about me, and all I know about you is that you maybe grew up around here, have surprising guitar skills, and can't resist an inspirational quote. I need back story. Now. Ah. Uh, I was a bit of a hell-raiser as a kid. You, an outlaw? So sneaking into other people's pools isn't your only unlawful act. - Nope. - How many people have you killed? Ha-ha. That's very funny. Nah, the truth is I was… I was a tosser. I was angry, destructive. I was acting out. And my mum was sick. Uh, she had cancer. I spent more time in town causing trouble than by her hospital bed. Her passing finally made me pull it together, but… It was too late. Well, I'm sure your mom would be very proud of the man that you are. So, I've actually been meaning to bring something up. Baaabra. Baaabra? Sunday dinner? - Not that sheep again. Nope. - Oh, come on. Spare her, please. She's a sweet soul. We've bonded. She could be like a War at ah Station ambassador. You know, something to keep the Airbnb guests busy, so they don't wander into the main house. Mm-mm. Okay. I'm not letting this go. Just so you know. Okay. Oh. I have no word but "wow." Beautiful. Maybe Australia doesn't hate you after all. Oh. So she's in Australia, trying to steal our account. I mean, it… it… it was originally hers. Well done, Lola. Clever girl. She found a workaround. You know, it'd be smart for you to do the same, Audra. Um, I… I… I have an idea where she might be. Whoo! Ah. Hey. It's Henry's birthday. We're hitting the turps. Down at the pub. Oh, I can't. Hazel's finally free to go over station business tonight. Yeah, I have to work too. Full in box. And I'm Salud Imports only employee. Oh, come on. Just one drink. One drink. You should go. Have fun. Knock the dust out of your throat with a couple of beers. Please. Okay. Because it's Henry, and only because it's Henry. One drink. Yay. Whoo! - Whoo! - Yeah! Yes! Okay, more drinks! Let's go! Yes! Hi. - Yeah. Having fun out there? - Yes. Another round? Hey. No, no. No, no flirting, thank you. No more bartenders for me. I don't know how to flirt, darling. Trust me. You know, this might be the last time I ever go sideways. I'm gonna be a mum. Oh. I'm gonna be a mum. You'll be a great mum. Darts! Darts! I love darts! Yeah. Let's play darts. - Let's do it! - I'll take you on. Oh, really? You ready to throw down? You think you can handle it, girly? "Girly"? Oh. Do you think you can handle it? Whoa! - Let's go, Breeze. - Here we go. Thoughts on the Shiraz? Blueberry. Black pepper. Earthy. Nice, I like it. See, your palate is incredible. You should be running Vaughn Family Wines. Okay. That's enough. These wines need the perfect roll out in California. And Lola has smart ideas, but she's not even licensed yet. All I know is Lola wants to earn this. So, it's up to you, Haze. Well, it could be up to you. Say yes to running it, just the wine division. It'd be nice if I had help. I am tired of this conversation. All right? So why are we still having it? You need a fire lit under your bum, Brother. No, I don't. I'm good here. All right? You're so talented and so stuck. It's infuriating. Look, I don't fit in your world. Once people find out I have money and power, that's all it's about. I like it out on the land, mustering the mob. It's peaceful. Okay? That's all I want. And I think you want more than that. Hmm. I saw you and Lola in the pool the other night. Are you busting my chops? Yeah. Well, I'm your sister. I know better, and it's my duty. She's gotten under your skin, huh? Ah. Ugh. Okay. Settle down. She's honest. She's fierce. She's determined, that's for sure. Hmm. Mm-hmm. What? Wait a second. What's that? Is that why you insisted that she stay? 'Cause you thought she'd get under my skin. You… - I don't have to answer that. - Yeah, right. You just did. So… Are you gonna tell Lola? You know I'll never tell anyone. Well, maybe it's time for that to change. Henry. - Hey. - Come on. Oh! That was a good one. Mate, that's not your score. You calling me a cheater? Yeah. He is because you are! Yeah. She's got you there, mate. No one calls me a cheat! Oi! Oi! See how you like that! Yeah? You want a piece of me? You wanna fight me? Amazing. Hey, wait. I remember you. Oh. Dad! Dad, I can't talk! I'm in a bar fight! I'll call you back! I should've never encouraged her to go to Australia. She's in a bar fight. Damn. I'm kinda jealous. I haven't been in a good bar fight in years. - Yeah! - Yeah! Sorry, mate, I got carried away. Another round! Yeah! No, no, no! No more rounds! Yo use are all cut off. All you troublemakers, get out of me bar now! I'm getting sick of this, Max. I'm getting really sick of it. All right? This mob have caused a lot of trouble for me tonight, and it's the last thing I need in my life. You know that. Don't you? Yeah. I know. Fiona's not talking to me. All right? I'm sorry, mate. I haven't seen me dogs in three months. It's just outta control. The last thing I need is to be dealing with this! I understand, mate. The constable and I played footie together. Yeah, yeah, I know. He loves you, mate. Look, I'm sorry and this should sort it. That should take care of it. All right? - It's very decent of you, Max. - You got it. You're a good boy. Always have been. - Get out of the way! - Okay. And thank this one and her whistle too. Saved most of me windows. - Thank you. - That's a very good whistle you've got. Oh, thank you so much. That means a lot to me. All right. Everyone back to the station. Tim, you're designated driver? Yeah, mate. I'm good. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go, let's go. All right. Back to the station. Oops, I forgot how to stand. Hey. Come here. Can I tell you a secret? I have never been in a real bar fight. Okay? There are so no bar fights at wine tastings. It's just like… you know, like, Sauv Blanc and, like, blah-blah-blah boring chitchat and... Oh, okay. Oh. Oh no. Are you gonna tell on me to Hazel? No. Look, she will probably think better of you. Don't worry. What do you think of me? Uh… Lola. Because I have thoughts about you. - Really? - Yes. Yes, indeedy. You are a mystery, Mister. You're like, you know, The Marlboro Man, but without the cigarettes. You live out on the land and answer to no one. But, I don't know, like, it seems kinda lonely. You know, like, are you even happy? - I don't know. - Look, Lola. There's something I need to tell you, but tonight's not the night. No, I'm telling you. - Oh? - Oh. Oops. Oh, I'm hiccupping. Ugh. See? This is why shots are a bad idea, because no one in history has ever been like, "Oh my God, I'm so glad we did that last shot." - Okay. Yeah, yeah, it's time to go. - Do you know what I mean? Go? - Yes, it's home time. Up you get. - But do you really know? Aw. I don't wanna go home. - Up you... Oh, whoa. How many… - I'm fine. - Whoa. You all right there? - Yeah. Can we get tacos? No. We'll get you a meat pie. You all right? - How many drinks did you have? - I don't want a meat pie. - That sounds disgusting. - It's delicious. Yeah, I'm gonna fall asleep here. Somehow, I won 100 dollars last night. And it's so pretty. - Good one. - Huh. So, I've got something to share. - Tim, you know, the head stock man? - Mm-hmm. He got a new job on another station as the boss cocky. How do I pitch myself to Max for his job? Okay. Hangover is suddenly cured. Breeze… ugh… look, you add so much value to this station. Max relies on you, so pitch the skills you've learned and how you plan to expand on them. Okay? I feel like I should be writing this down. Hold on. You all right? Uh, on a scale of one to ten, how embarrassing was I last night? Uh… No. You were cute. In a law-breaking hooligan sort of way. Okay. I work in wine. We're sippers, not two-fisters. - Right. - Mm. Yeah. Well, the good thing is you're not properly part of station crew until you've gotten legless and you've started a barney. So, congratulations. - That somehow made sense to me. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Yeah? Hey. So I'm driving supplies to the winery today. You care to join? What? The winery? Yes! Oh my God. I've been dying to go. I know, I know. And since I know Lola Alvarez probably doesn't do days off, we can make it a working day off. There's a fence that needs mending on the far side of the station. Oh, okay. Good. I was worried there for a second, so… I also thought, uh… I thought we could camp out overnight. Yeah. I know a good spot. Yeah. Um, just give me two minutes to pack. This… This is why I'm here. What, you don't like shoveling sheep dung? I've arranged a private tour with the winemaker, Felix. Oh, wow. Someone has a fancy "in" here. Impressive. And in here, we have state-of-the-art climate control. Oh, it feels so nice after being outside. The perfect balance of temperature and humidity to age the wine. Hmm. I'd actually been consulting with a rival winery. Then Hazel lured me away when she expanded Vaughn Family Wines. Oh, I can see why. It's amazing here. And you said all the wines are organic? - Yes. And bio dynamic. - Wow. No chemicals, no manipulations, just grapes. - So, my specialty is blends. - Hmm. Vaughn Family Wines have really unique flavor profiles found nowhere else. The varietals both complement and contrast in the glass. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. Okay. I'll get you to try this. This is a Shiraz blend from the cooler climate of the Yarra Valley. Oh. Mm. Okay. Oh. It's like I'm in a rustic mountain cabin, warming myself next to a wood-burning fire, cozy under a cashmere blanket. Mm. Beautifully put. We've also produced a Chardonnay blend from the same region. It's my special reserve. Citrus and mineral. Ooh. Sign me up for that. It's 200 dollars a bottle. Um, sign me up for the email list instead, maybe. I could break one open for a wee taste. Max? Uh, yeah, another time. Yeah. We still have work to do. - Mm. Hmm. - Mm-hmm. - I'll pack you some wine to-go. - Cool, thanks. So, how does this work? I mean, you're obviously a regular here. I like the way you talk about wine. Yeah. How it transports you. Well, I believe that wine should be a vacation. Or should I say holiday? Mm. Is this the official label for all the Vaughn Family Wines? Uh, think so, yeah. Felix would know. I wonder why it's called Vaughn Family Wines. I mean, Hazel kinda seems like a solo act. Hmm. Where is my notebook? This place is giving me ideas. Hey, last night, uh, you said something at the pub. Oh God, what? - Actually, no. Don't tell me. - Nah, it's too late. Uh, you said I seem lonely. - Yikes. - Mm-hmm. I guess, uh… In vino veritas? Boozy truth? You know, I always chalked it up to most women not liking life out in the bush. It's hot, remote, dangerous. It is not for the faint of heart. Yeah, but rugged loner is just a way of making excuses for myself. You know, when my mum died, I promised I'd do better, but I've just been playing it safe. Unlike someone I know. Wow. Okay. Turns out my drunken babbling wasn't such a disaster after… Oh. Kangaroo! A baby kangaroo. - A juvenile. - Baby kangaroo. See, I bet its mum made this hole in the fence. They're everywhere. Okay. Can I not just enjoy this one stereotypical Aussie moment? Oh my God. Are you serious? That is your lock screen? Excuse me, sir. This is a private photo of me and my best friend. Ugh. Aww. Now I just need to see a koala. You promised. I did no such thing. - Yes, you did. - Nope. Remember the other day? - I don't, 'cause it didn't happen. - You said it. Better make it happen. You're making… You better fix that fence right now. It's so cute. Wow. Australia showing off again. Thank you, Australia! What are you scribbling so intently? - I was inspired by our field trip. - Hmm. I have new ideas to pitch to Hazel. Ah. Sybylla Vaughn. Yep. A new label. Every bottle should tell her story. Look, Lola, the funny thing about Sybylla is... Sybylla is what makes Vaughn Family Wines. She's the key. I mean, she can create a personal relationship between the winemaker and the wine drinker. Sybylla is an aspirational inspiration to all. That's a really great idea. I've been feeling really creative. I think it's from my time here at War at ah Station. - I don't know how to put it, but... - It's revived your senses, maybe? - Yes! - Yeah. Exactly. Air smells fresher. Food tastes better. I sleep like a log. Okay. Well, I can drink to that. Wait, is that the… Is that the 200-dollar bottle of Chardonnay? I had Felix put it on ice. You… You said you wanted to try it. Just say cheers. Okay. Salud. Oh. Yeah. And we're also celebrating sparing your sheep. Blah Blah whatever its name is. - It won't be Sunday supper. Oh God. - Baaabra? -Yeah. It won't -Really? Yeah, nah. Was that more on the "yeah," or the "nah"? Or just a meaningless "yeah, nah"? Yeah, nah. You won me over. All right? - Can we put a cute scarf around her neck? - No. - And a… and a name plaque on her pen? - Oh my goodness. - Settle down. - Please? Nah. Mm. I don't want today to end… …but bed is calling my name. Swag check. Hey. Oh! Oh, it's just a harmless tree snake. Likes to warm up in the bedroll, don't ya? Just when I was starting to like this place. There you go, buddy. Okay. - Wow. - It's all good. - Whatever you say. - Whatever I say. Oh, okay. Hello? - You all right? - Yeah. Oh. The stars are amazing here. That's Alpha Centauri there, and, uh, that's the Southern Cross. Hey. What if that snake comes back? We will have safety in numbers. Lola, there's, uh… There's something I need to tell you. I should've told you a while ago it's… but it's not as big as... Hmm. Morning, spitfire. Morning, boss cocky. Hmm. Uh, Lola. You need to know now. I'm Max Vaughn. - Sorry, what? - Max Vaughn. Great-great grandson of Sybylla Vaughn. Hazel Vaughn's younger brother. Wait. What? No. What? No, no, no. I… I Google-stalked Hazel before I came. I mean, a Fatal Attraction-level stalk... Yeah. I… I don't have social media, and I wiped the Internet of my family ties. You can do that when you have heaps of money. - Wait, Hazel's money? - No, mine. Hazel and I are business partners. I'm… I'm a silent investor. I don't… I don't understand. When Mum died, Hazel and I inherited War at ah. All right? I turned it into a profitable station while Hazey went off and earned her MBA at uni and invested in her first company. I gave her the capital. Listen, Lola. Hazel is my sister and I love her, but I don't envy her. The people will do anything to get access to her. Oh. What, like me? So, you think that I'd use you? In all fairness, you did come to War at ah to land Hazel as a client. Yeah, but I was truthful. I mean, I… I told you both why I was here. I'm not some thief after anyone's money. I worked hard for a genuine opportunity. But you know what? What would you know about honesty? Yeah. All right. Look, I deserve that. All right? The thing is, Lola, I just… I never expected you to throw me for a loop. Okay, so all this time, sharing confidences… I even asked you about Vaughn Family Wines and you're only telling me this now? I'm sorry. All right? This isn't easy for me. The only person at War at ah who knows is Hazel. But I trust you. Great… Great, you trust me, but… but how am I now supposed to trust you? I'm the same person that you spent the last two weeks with, Lola. The same person that you kissed last night. Oh, right. I was just trying to protect my heart. Yeah. Well, I… I wish I'd done the same. You're right. I'm, uh… I'm here on business, so… let's get back to it. Oh, there you are. Lola, Hazel wants to see you right now up at the house. - Now? - Now. Okay. That is a great idea. We'll make it happen. That's good. Oh, Lola. Calder was just telling me how you worked for him for years, and how devastated he was that you decided to strike out on your own. It's why I came all this way. To hire you back. Wait, what? I thought... I'm impressed by the lengths you went to to get this account. Lola's being promoted to National Sales Director. She'll be handling your account. Vaughn Family Wines was all her idea. The timing is perfect. Calder, Lola can take you and Audra to visit the winery, and I'll have my Sydney office draw up the contracts. Sounds great. Right, Lola? Calder? A moment? Alone? You just show up blindsiding me? Look, Audra's no Lola. Okay? You hold things together at Mythos. So I'll forgive that messy outburst you had when you quit. A 20% pay bump comes with that promotion, plus bonuses. Struggling is so pedestrian when you don't need to, Lola. Make it easy on yourself. Say yes. Hmm. I don't do easy. Never have. The answer is no. Everything good? Actually, uh, Calder's mistaken. I won't be returning to Mythos, but I understand that you need to go with an established importer. I'm disappointed you won't be on my team. Salud Imports is just too new. Sybylla Vaughn inspired me. You have a unique opportunity here to have her inspire countless others around the world. Parting gift. Best of luck to you. Good luck to you too, Lola. Hazel, uh, shall we go back and discuss strategy and scheduling? - Go ahead. I'll be right there. - Okay. You're doing the wrong thing, Haze. I saw Lola at the winery yesterday. She's the person for the job. Well, now you suddenly care about Vaughn Family Wines? Wild guess, you decided to tell Lola who you are, and it was too late and blew up in your face. Oh. Hate to say it, Brother, you should've stepped up sooner. In work and in love. Are you insane? You walked away from everything you always wanted. You know, I've learned a lot about myself in Australia. One is, I don't like Vegemite, but more importantly, I was right when I quit Mythos. Life is too short for the Calders of the world. You know, I… I… I panicked. I… I'm sorry, I was desperate. I'm… I am a horrible person. Look, I get it. Okay? You made a bad decision because you were in a tough spot with Calder. There were tons of times when I felt the same way. Really? So you understand? Yeah, but it was not your finest moment. - Oh, no, no, I know I'm like… Oh my God. - Let's be real. I really know that. I'm so… I'm really… I'm so sorry. - Yeah. - I'm so… I'm so sorry. So, do you think that we could be, like, friends again? - Yeah, nah. Don't get ahead of yourself. - No, yeah. Yeah. You're right. Hey, it's okay to overdress for an occasion. Never apologize for style. You take care, you hear? Good girl. Here. Guess what we stole when Dan no was out on smoko? - Champagne? - Bubbles! 'Cause guess who's now head stock woman? What? Oh! Congrats, girl! Thank you. We're also celebrating that Kylie got bumped up to wool classer. - No biggie. No biggie. Thank you. - What? Amazing. Well, that means that the team actually needs a new roustabout. If only we knew someone. Mm. Thanks, ladies, but you know what? Day-drinking for my living is much, much easier. - Fair. - All good. We heard that wine thing didn't work out exactly the way you planned. Yeah. You know, you win some, you lose some. Before I forget. - Returning the loaners. - Thank you. - Aw. Perfect condition. - For you. How did you do that? I, um… I cleaned them. - That checks out, yeah. - Right. Yeah. Yeah. One more thing. - Ooh, ooh. What is this? - Oh. Okay. - Open it. - What is it? It's a… it's a FLATOUTbear. I've never really heard of them, but it's… it's a thing here. Yeah. And I love it. My, uh… My dad's my best friend. He's got a lot of opinions about a lot of things, but I love it. And, um… And I know you're gonna be amazing too, so… Aw. - Thank you. - Yeah. - I'm gonna… - Go. - We'll see you later. Yup, see ya. - Yeah. Ooh. So, all that to just… To walk away? Staying true to myself. I'll figure it out. Sybylla Vaughn didn't give up, and neither do I. Look, about us, I just... There is no us. Okay? I'm a Yank career gal heading home to the big smoke and you're here doing your undercover boss thing. It would… It would never work. And for the record, I never cared what your last name was. I never even asked. No, uh, parting words of wisdom? Nah. I got nothing. Goodbye, Max Vaughn. Goodbye, Lola Alvarez. Why doesn't your company buy its own darn coffee machine? Oh please, Dad, you love being unofficial officer manager. - Hmm. Use a coaster. - Okay. - Refill, Audra? - Oh. Yes, please. You know, when you rented that nice apartment, Lola, I was hoping to turn this into a yoga studio. Dad, when have you ever done yoga? Uh, I was voted most flexible Latino in high school. I still got some tricks. - Wow. - Namaste. I wonder if, um, Hazel's gonna end up going with the Sybylla wine label. Yeah. Like, speaking of, it's all over the wine trade websites. Hmm? Mythos and Vaughn Family Wines have parted ways. - Wow. - Yeah. That was quick. Yeah. Like, still in the contractual grace period, apparently. Um, the official reason is they had, like, different working styles, but you know. I mean, AKA, they got to know Calder better, right? Ugh. So, like, should… should we go after Vaughn Wines? I mean, it was your idea. Let's focus on new business. Have you even tried calling Max? No. Look, it took me a while to figure this out, but it's not even that he lied, you know? I… I don't know. I just… I don't think he knows who he is yet. Sure, but what if his way to change that was to share it with someone he really trusted, and that was you? So when did you get so wise? Since you gave me a second chance. You see the best in people, Lola. Even when they don't deserve it. You believing in them makes them want to be that best version. Yeah. I just, uh… When we said goodbye, he didn't step up for me. So, in Max's Pinterest wisdom, the horse is already out of the barn. Well, actually, Uruguay is a rising star in the wine world. Its mild maritime climate is ideal for grape growing. And the women of the wine collective we're representing are known for their red varietals. Even their award-winning Tent Flint. Give it a taste. Mm. You know, we're starting to stock more niche wines. I love your product. - Great. Of course. - And I would love your card. - For you. Thank you so much. - Thank you. This feels so good. - Lola. - Yeah. Hamish! Hi! Oh! Oh! Tasteful, but, uh, limited offerings. When are you gonna expand your list? Oh, Hamish. You know I'm working on it. I don't know. I gave you a good lead and you blew it, spectacularly. Nah, mate. I'm the one who blew it. What… What are you doing here? I'm not a silent partner anymore. The reaction to the new label is through the roof. Salud Imports is exactly what Vaughn Family Wines needs. She accepts. We're your new importer. Okay. And I'm not just here on business. Baaabra misses you. Sadly, it's true. She mopes all around her pen all day. And she won't even wear her scarf anymore. She's miserable. So you came all this way to give me an update on Baaabra? Mm-hmm. No. I came all this way to say I'm done hiding out. You never gave up, Lola. But somewhere along the way, I did. I was a fool to let you go. So here I am. Go big or go home. Right? Shut up and kiss me already. I now pronounce you wife and wife. - Whoo-hoo! - Share a kiss. Heyo! Yeah! - Whoo! - Whoo! It's time to celebrate, everyone! Yeah. - Look at you go. - Right? - That was very good. - Thank you. Thank you. I think Sybylla would love knowing that her story didn't end with her. War at ah Station's never short on one thing, happy endings.
