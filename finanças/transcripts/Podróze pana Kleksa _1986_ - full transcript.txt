PART I THE ENVOYS OF TALEDOCIA MR BLOT'S VOYAGES Hi, kiddo. Mr Blot? It's I, indeed. I came to see you. Don't cry. You know, I once met a little boy who looked very much like you. If you want me to, I'll tell you about him because he too had to overcome his fear... and loneliness. Everything started when the Great Electronic and his robots gang invaded and conquered Inventors Island and entered Patentonia, the capital. Today the master of the world Will be he Who knows the magic of those words That are three Power, feeding, energy Get it to your brains Stop, switch off your heart and on the computer Obedient robot Knows the system A steel core and on it Wire is twisted Operates codeless DNA DNA Dolby system Yeah Without any hesitation Push it into operation Just sit and wait To see it go For you the laser Will burn your foe Leaving the shelter The next day See the wonderful world Clear and clean to stay For years of DNA to share DNA Dolby system DNA Switching on the record of your memory... for 24 seconds. Here is the program. Everything human deteriorates and is imperfect. Thinking exhausts. Imagination is hostile to precision operations. I am free, because another brain thinks for me. I'll try to always properly respond to impulses and will myself delete compassion, love and anger from my memory. The program is approved. I now welcome all winners on the command platform of Inventors' Island which as of today becomes the capital of our Empire. Well, fifth generation take your positions. The Science Developing Centre was changed into a Control Centre. Archmechanic, the former king of Patentonia, had to run for his life. His friends, scientists and inventors from many countries were put to jail and forced to work for the Great Electronic. Serving under the orders of the despotic and cruel Emperor was, among others, Aloysius Bubble, former assistant to Philip the barber, now colonel Aloysius Bubble. It was him that the Great Electronic entrusted with a secret mission which gave the start to amazing events. We're taking off. Takeoff granted. Direction Taledocia! Welcome atendees of the Great Fairytale competition. Welcome, welcome. Who are you, young man? I'm the merchant's son from the tale of the flying trunk. The King's orders are that all luggage and guns are to be stored in the fable locker-room. Where is the locker room? Nor far from here. At Sunbeam Street. Sister, look, what a funny horse... He's a hunchback, looks vitamin deficient. Funny dupe. Hey, listen, smarties! As for him this was just basic The camel walked to the oasis His back loaded with his treasure Two huge humps placed at his leisure Hyena's laugh was rather mean Isn't that a funny scene! You would think you'd die of shame If you were to look the same Four-legged monster, what a sight Makes you burst with laugh all right Four-legged monster, what a sight Makes you burst with laugh all right The camel just dropped his eyes While she strut behind the guy Sneering right behind his back making him a nervous wreck Four-legged monster, what a sight Makes you burst with laugh all right Four-legged monster, what a sight Makes you burst with laugh all right Finally she got him mad Using all the strength he had He collided with the goof Kicking her with his hind hoof When in the desert you run Of a hunchback don't make fun Four-legged monster, what a sight Makes you burst with laugh all right When in the desert you run Of a hunchback don't make fun Of a hunchback don't make fun Of a hunchback don't make fun The impudent brat, how dare he criticize us. When you double all your powers When you double all your powers Louder even are the cheers Louder even are the cheers Long live the Great Storyteller Long live the Great Storyteller Longer than a hundred years That constant crying will drive me mad. Can nobody silence that baby? Sire, hear the song of your loyal servant which, I hope, will be a relief to you and you'll forget about your toothache! Really? Go ahead! Boni means a loyal servant Who will serve you faithfully Mine's not a very long story Sire, please do listen to me What you advise I think is wise My master knows best It's renowned In the shade of your throne and crown I sing to the glory of my boss The king's face is the world's light Not to look at it is no great loss The grace of the court is so bright I think I might pass out If he only becons at me Any no becomes a yes immediately When he is giving me his orders They change my mind beyond all borders And whether you like it or not Do not mention all that rot About freedom, all that bit It may give the king a fit Thanks, my king, for having listened The rest in your ear I'll whisper The rest in your ear I'll whisper The rest in your ear I'll whisper Welcome to Ali Baba and the Forty Robbers. Welcome, welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Give way to the king's messenger. - Help yourself to tasty ice cream. - Thank you. How are you, Little Red Riding Hood? How is your Granny? The name of this girl was Alice and I intend to present her adventures on the other side of the mirror honorable Talers, at the big fairytale competition. Hi, dwarf. Isn't that the most wonderful attire, Your Majesty? Shepherdess! How nicely this fits. As per your wish and your instructions. The king's messenger? A splendid attire! - Wait! - Shepherdess! Your Highness! - He is naked! - It fits perfectly! Welcome, distinguished Alib-Malik This is the wreath which will decorate the head of the winner. Truly, duchess, if he gets it from your hands, he will be a hundred times happy. For this moment only it's worth to participate in the competition. Go to the room, the successor to our throne is there. When His Smallness cries, our monarch gets a toothache. I'm afraid we'll have to serve a very whimsical sovereign. I listen and obey And now tell me what news you bring Your Majesty, tale writers have arrived from Violin Islands, from Chatter Cape and Declamation Peninsula. Unfortunately, we didn't yet get the Taleolins which King Musicus III promised. Our musicians are appalled. The Minister of Information, here you are. Your Majesty, the Taleolins will arrive tonight. King Musicus wouldn't disappoint us. We now see the gardens of Story Land. Direction: smoke. Color red. What's that roaring and thunder? That's all I needed. It will rain in a moment and all guests... will be flooded. And do not forget... Give it to me... Do not forget to pour our greatest treasure to inkpots at dawn the ink brought from distant Caligraphia. These are my orders. Can everybody hear me? We hear you. We are obedient. - Welcome Zero Seven. - Welcome, Unconquered. Everything OK? As per your wish and your instructions. The most recent model. A cape. And scarf, the right thing for a storyteller. Will you please tell the Great Emperor that Boni means a loyal servant. Doctor Doolittle and his friends. Just wait, little hare. Wait... I'll show you. What's the matter? Disaster, calamity! The spilled ink went to sea! It's getting farther away! It floats away! It floats away... It floats away... Please, calm down. A special commission is examining the reasons of the acudent. The ink is gone... the competition is gone. There will be no fairytales. There will be no Taledocia. Your Majesty... I know who may help us retrieve the ink right away. If you indicate the one who can save us you will be richly re... re... - Rewer. .. - Rewarded. Right! Rewarded. The man who may come to our assistance is one known as Ambrose Blot, doctor of philosophy chemistry, medicine, student of doctor Pai Chi Wo. Professor of mathematics and astronomy at Salamanca university. Professor Blot. Immediately dispatch a messenger to Salamanca. Professor Blot is not in Salamanca, Your Majesty. Pardon me, Your Majesty. Professor Blot is not in Salamanca, Your Majesty. Oh, light of our eyes! Lord of our thoughts, pardon me for speaking up without being asked, but Professor Blot isn't at his Academy eithen. Then where is he? As far as I know Professor Blot is now in Avalanche Mountains on Kara-teque Meadow with his friend doctor Pai Chi Wo. Why am I, the Minister of Information, always the last to know? Are you all right, master? Hold it, son. A messenger from the King of Taledocia to Mr Blot. Pardon me, my noble teacher and host, but I cannot stay any longer at the illustrious academy of doctor Pai Chi Wo. Important problems force me to head to the Kingdom of Taledocia. An ignoble deed was performed there. Its effects difficult to forecast have to be prevented. I know, my dear friend, that only a problem of utmost importance could make you leave our celebrations. I wish you friendly sunbeams. I'll give you a diamond ball. Maybe the power it contains will come in handy to you in your just starting adventure. Remember our charms. Salem aleikum. Welcome, professor. Mr Blot to the King of Taledocia. To the King of Taledocia. This way. Welcome, most famous professor. The King is expecting you. What's going on here? Who is this man? There's no air in here. Well, is it better now? The room has to be emptied two minutes from now. Professor Ambrose Blot... scholar. How did you do it? I can't believe my own ears. Have you used magic... to calm my baby? This time it worked without magic, Your Majesty. Frankly, sire, I chased all your magicians and loafers from the little prince's room. His mama's presence will be enough to keep him happy. Lighter clothes and a bit of sunlight. Thank you... magnificent stranger. I begin to cherish hopes that you will actually be capable to help us out of trouble. Is it true you may supply a barrelful of ink ? Yes, because I happen to know the roads to the resources of priceless components of navy blue and black color. Will you help us, please? It is imperative if we want to open our competition. Indeed! Certain terms have to be kept. Tell me what your prize is. I will do whatever you ask for. Valuable prizes are given to money-grubbers and globetrotters We scientists are concerned only with the welfare of mankind. You just let me have one of your ships, an experienced captain and a crew of thirteen. All right. Will the court chief get me right away... Captain Quaterno. I listen and obey. What I want to say now is only for the king's ears. Well, I would like the time and place of starting our dangerous expedition to be top secret. What are you talking of, shame on you. Not a word to any living soul. Captain Quaterno, the bravest captain in our fleet. Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke. He has one weak spot only, he loves chocolate. Here it is captain's chocolate. Thank you very much. At that time of the day I consume only two hair-growing pills Oh, let me have some too. I got a little bald. I can feel them growing very slowly. Attention! Captain, tonight you will sail off, with professor Blot in command. Wait a moment. The professor, OK? Come on, young man! Come on! Good evening, professor. I am the ship boy. My name is Pete. Shall I wake the crew? I think we can manage. Cutting waves the boat progresses It is an enchanted vessel Surfaces right from the deep And when daytime goes to sleep Up it rises in the air Above the clouds to stay there Both the vessel and the crew Float in an ocean of blue In the silvery mountain weather Lives a bird with fiery feathers In their glow on as they tug The crew sleeps warm and snug Sleep well, boy, we have a long and dangerous journey ahead. Goodnight, professor. Goodnight. Under protection of the dark I got the ship out of the port toward deep seas. At sunrise I headed toward Bergamot Islands from Cape Telltale. Ever since the start of this journey I knew we would face some unique adventures. For the first time I really missed my secrets which had been destroyed in the attic of the Academy. Soon I would have to meet the crew and I couldn't show them any fear or weakness. The success of our expedition depended on it too. On deck, hurry. Hurry, hurry. Allow me to introduce, professor. The sailor ever lost in his thoughts is Talens, our helmsman. Ahoy, professor. I told the crew the tale of your Academy last night. He is an unmatched sailor and moreover has a gift for telling fairy tales. I must admit it tends to be embarrassing sometimes. One never knows, if he is taking the ship to its actual destination or to invented, nonexistent lands. And this is Bank, our boatswain. As of today under the command of professor Ambrose Blot. What do you say, boatswain? To the glory of Taledocia, captain. This round sailor is our chef, Fortelas. Welcome to our kitchen, professor. The fame of Mr Blot's colored cuisine entitles us to hope that you'll prepare a dish for us. Doubtless. Cooking is my specialty. Our Fortelas, being a true Taledocian, is also a writer of fairy tales. He possesses a magic skillet, which always gets back to him like a boomerang. And these are: - Balthasar. - My regards. - Bruno. - Pleasure. - Bozhidar. - Hello. - Boniface. - Boniface. Benjamin, the seawolf. The seawolf... - Benon. - Benon. And Barnaba. I think we've met before. You have a good memory, professor. As a pirate from Treasure Island I attended the famous third eye projection at your Academy. Meanly interrupted by the mechanical doll. - I would... - undoubtedly, undoubtedly... If professor allows, this is Pete, the ship boy. It's his first cruise. We got to know each other a bit. We all know the target of this expedition: to fill the barrels with precious ink. If we can cope with all obstacles and achieve it, the people of Taledocia will glorify us in their poems, songs and legends. Cheers for Mr Blot! Cheers for Mr Blot! Well, gentlemen, anchors aweigh. Full ahead! Full ahead toward new adventures it's much more than an everyday venture Who is in commend Mr Blot, it's his position What's the password Great expedition Response I'm on the brink Just think Oh sure, it's ink Full ahead toward new adventures it's much more than an everyday venture Let all the weaklings stay ashore We feel good as we explore Having Mr Blot aboard We're onstage and never bored. Who'll dance Boatswain, we all will The helmsman stays at the helm The rest follow me Climb the mast and the gaff Just look at the captain I think he laughs! Hey, cook, show us if you're skilled We don't want to fry on skillets You know I'm the perfect chef I'm talented and I'm cleft You feed us bones Taking a chance Starving sailors cannot dance Then stop eating, I can't wait But why are you gaining weight Full ahead, ship ahoy We'll turn problems Into a dance of joy Full ahead toward new adventures It's much more than an everyday venture Full ahead, ship ahoy We'll turn problems Into a dance of joy Full ahead toward new adventures It's much more than an everyday venture Captain, the helmsman has reported that the compass has gone absolutely mad. The danger that we'll sail in circles is facing us. I think there is a way. As of now, my beard will point to the North. Oh my... As we deviated from the right course and almost got stranded on the shallows of Anatole's archipelago, we turned northeast and ever since kept the direction indicated by my beard. Hands laps is educative, shapes character, reflex and increases general physical fitness. Get to my cabin, boy and bring my hair growth pills. My compass seems to be thinning. OK professor. Pete, throw the rope under the mizzen. Where do you think you're putting these ropes, get right back, rascal. You're lazybones and untidy too. Dusting has to be made every morning, see? Understood? Isn't he clumsy? I was about to shave when my mirror broke. No mirror ever breaks without good reason, maybe this is a sign we are near our target. Actually, here we are. A pirate motorboat on the horizon... Nearing starboard... Boatswain, the field glass. Well, that's all we needed. Crew! Take in sails! - Pete, the smoke screener! - Yes, sir! All under deck. We submerge. Close all doors, tighten all holes. Easy, gentlemen, easy. The boatswain will call a meeting of the crew below deck. Faster! Hurry up gentlemen, hurry. Hurry, hurry, everybody down deck. - Faster! - Don't push me. - Peter, chop-chop. - Go ahead Mr Barnaba. Oh my poor head. Hurry, hurry. Come on, come on. How about that... How about that... My dear men forget the pirates for just a while and look at the depths welcoming us. What is that... What kind of visitors are these... Well, well, well... Well look at that... What kind of visitors are these? Professor! Unispit! Welcome, how are you my dear? Everybody is well. Everybody is well. Go on, gentlemen, the mysteries of the depths lie ahead. Tell me, my dear duckbill, do you happen to know where the calamari are? Over there, over there. Come on, come on... Come on gentlemen, after me. How are you, how are you, I'm the boatswain, how are you. Easy, Boniface, easy... This is just Mr Note who soothes tense nerves with his soft music. Give me a break! And these are my deep sea dancers. They secrete a black and navy blue dye which, when diluted, may be used as ink. I think our professor is a bit... something... Beautiful, beautiful... What a color, thank you, thank you very much. Let's try and see... Here it is. Ink, true, genuine, blue ink. He did it. First rate, perfect, gentlemen, We may return to Taledocia now. Good for us. It's first rate ink, Pete. Welcome to the underwater country of our gracious Queen Aba. It is with great interest that we came to visit you, noble Abets, but we'd like to inform Queen Aba personally of the reason for our visit. The Queen will receive you soon. Now, I am inviting you to a modest reception which will help you regain your strength after your recent experiences. Mr Talens... Scrumptious... it's Malmsey, really excellent. Yes.. Ink... Mr Fortelas, it's your skillet. I will not carry it for you. Oh, thanks Mr Boniface. I knew you would be back. Her Royal Majesty, the lady of dance and music, Queen Aba. Aba the Queen of the Ocean depths Her servants guard the land's treasures from theft. Welcome to Underwater Land. I would like to know what brings my honored guests led by the amazing Mr Blot whose fame has reached us already. We came to this underwater land to ask you, milady, for your consent to fill our barrels with calamari's ink. It is indispensable for the fairy tale competition in Taledocia. Fill our guests' barrels wlth calamari's ink and let me know when your request is granted. Captain, will you personally see to the handling of ink barrels. Aba sings Aba sings Aba sings Aba sings Beautiful Lady Melusine Fell in love with Emptycray This is how the story starts Let us hear now what it says What is happening on land May happen underwater too The refrain of our song Sing it you and you and you Melusine, Melusine Do not cherish hopes too vain Take off in your limousine The world laughs, the world laughs But love, my dear friends is insensitive to wisdom And for one moment spent together Forgets about sneer What a funny thing to happen Well, well Well, well That's interesting Hokus-pokus Hokus-pokus What a funny thing to happen Hokus-pokus My dear Emptycray Have trust in love Accept the gifts For the soul and for the palate Hokus-Pokus Hokus-Pokus But the old Emptycray On the rocky bottom of the sea Wasn't tricked into believing That witchcraft works So smart was he So smart was he Melusine, Melusine Do not cherish hopes too vain Take off in your limousine The world laughs, the world laughs What is happening on land Happens underwater too The refrain of our song Sing it you and you and you Your Majesty, somebody guilefully fed sugar to our calamari. Ever since they will produce exclusively white ink, - completely useless to our tale... - Talers. Exactly, Talers. Indeed, what is happening on land may happen underwater too. When sinking to the sea bottom our ship was severely damaged. Repairs won't take less than... three days. Dear friends, obviously it wasn't fated that we finish our expedition right here. But courage! I know one more place where we'll be able to fill our barrels with ink. In the city of Patentonia on Inventors Island there is a huge ink basin in storage, patent number 1101. But the three days delay, that's too bad. I can forget the word I gave King Apolinaire. My royal bathysphere is at your disposal. Out on the sea you will meet a ship heading toward Inventors Island. Great. And so the captain, helmsman and four sailors stay here and take care of repairs of the ship. The boatswain, Fortelas, Pete, Barnaba and I will head to the surface. Professor, I definitely want to accompany you on your journey to be able to take advantage of... the infinite treasury of your wisdom. How is the helm? Repaired? We'll finish tomorrow, Mr Talens. I want to reveal a secret to you. I am not an Abet. I am the daughter of King Musicus, the sovereign of sunny Cacaphonia. My father decided I would marry Frank the Musician, a poor shepherd, whose playing the fife gave me nausea. Anyway, his fife was the scare of the whole local population. I was in love with the strong, rich and handsome prince, Octavius Demandolino. He was the owner of a stuffed chocolate factory. And I adore stuffed chocolate. But the will of my father who was supporting amateurs with iron consequence was unbreakable. In despair, I decided to rather part with life than with my beloved Octavius. I jumped into the sea from the highest cliff in the whole Kingdom. When I regained consciousness, the Abets were carrying me in a sedan chair and the people of this land made me their queen. I got fond of my subjects and even reconciled to what was my fate. I even founded an underwater disco here. Too bad your visit will be so short. Come on, gentlemen. Will this sail? What a story! You better sit down, boy, it will start rocking in a while. Good morning, gentlemen. Welcoming you on board is our Central Control System of the bathysphere. Watch it. We start surfacing. To make the hardships of the journey easier for you, you will be put to sleep by the music of a rustling shell. Where will the Queen's bathysphere take our voyagers? What adventures and dangers lie ahead for little Pete? Will the envoys of Taledocia eventually find the ink they so badly needed? How will the duel between the Great Electronic and Mr Blot end? All this, meaning the further experiences of Mr Blot, his friends and foes will be revealed in "Inventors Island", part two of "Voyages of Mr Blot". PART II INVENTORS ISLAND Enter your id cassette. Enter your number. Colonel Aloysius Bubble. Division of special operations. Id number 57931. Personal data and to date merits: Former assistant to Philip the barber, dispatched to tale of Prince Mathew operates in disguise as a bird hunter. As commander of the palace guards he makes invasion of werewolf troops possible. By order 13001 transformation is approved. Quiet your thoughts, control your emotions. In a while you will face his highness the Great Electronic. Colonel Aloysius Bubble reporting. Welcome, colonel Bubble. Do I, in you, welcome a man of success? Well, why don't you answer? Your highness, I have two information in my report of which one is good, one is bad. I wonder with which I should start. Always with the happy one, Aloysius. To put the emperor in a joyous mood which will make it easier for him... to swallow the pill of bad news. For one I sunk the flagship Apollinaire with that damned Blot and his crew on board. You did... Unfortunately, along went our best agent, Boniface. Only a computer does not trust appearances. I do not quite understand your Electronic Highness. Well, it's very simple, colonel Bubble. Your success is a failure. And what you deplore is success. Remember it once and for all, colonel. Mr Blot's ships do not sink, they submerge. Our agent Boniface is still operating and very efficiently too. All in all I am satisfied with you, Aloysius. What you'll see in a moment will be the best proof of the trust I have in you, colonel You will be the first man to see sensvision. Here is a space picture of all energy sources on both fairy tale hemispheres. Mr Boniface! Boniface! I would like to reveal a secret to you. Something that doctor Pai Chi Wo revealed to me. I have a feeling that surprising and very dangerous adventures are ahead. Therefore my boy, and it is proof of highest trust, I will tell you the secret spell of doctor Pai Chi Wo. Look, this is the source of great power. Interesting... Somewhere in the underwater depth of the Unpacific Ocean a new energy source has just appeared. Let's see... in what direction it will move. It's evidently floating toward the shores of Apothecaria. Attention passengers of the royal bathysphere, this is the central control system speaking. On the ocean there is a storm raving now which makes surfacing impossible. In a moment we'll start our emergency motors and will sail toward quiet seas, so do not panic please. For your information, here is our situation on the ocean. Be quiet, please. Blimey... Where will we drift now, professor? We're heading toward a land entirely unknown to me. This map indicates we should reach the shore in a while. Our bathysphere had an emergency landing on Apothecary Peninsula. No data about danger. The end of transmission. At last. We should reach a port as soon as possible. You better hurry, gentlemen. - Where are we? - This must be an island. It rather looks like a peninsula. Whoever you are, welcome to the Kingdom of Both Pharmacies. We gather from your attitude that you arrived with peaceful intentions. Be healthy! My name Is Ambrose Blot, I am a professor and these are my friends from Taledocia. Can you tell us where we precisely are and what do we owe the welcome ceremony considering we came here as a surprise, even to ourselves. Propitious currents brought your big capsule to Apothecary Cape. And the retinue you see is just now heading toward the site of today's celebrations with the pharmacist's statue to celebrate the feast of the first pill today. I know who the founder of this strange land was. Would you please explain, honorable pharmate, how are the subjects of King Piller staying young forever, as I cannot see anybody here who is over thirty. This is one of our greatest inventions. Its secret is the formula of rejuvenating pills. Each pill can rejuvenate somebody by about ten years. But one has to be careful with overdosage, because it could mean returning to babyhood. I for instance, am 168 years old. A wonderful age... And now, my dear guests, let me take you to the graciously reigning King Piller the Second the provider of Apothecary Peninsula and Both Pharmacies. You should know that Mr Blot's fame is known here. One of our national dances is the Blot-dance And one of our favorite songs is Mr Blot's work titled "Guide for a Young Herbalist". - Professor... - Very well. In the Young Herbalist's Guide Written to make mankind happy One recipe is reiterated The one which contains The secret of youth Chamomile flower Nettle leaf Herb of pansy Black pepper Pumpkin kernels Lingonberries And some poppies' heads juice Hawthorn fruit The wild rose And a small leaf of thyme Dry, crumb Grind, weigh Warm, soak And boil Dry, crumb Grind, weigh Warm, soak And boil And when the brew Is ready Look for wisdom In your brains Do not try it Get rid of it Do not drink it Just take some strength From the sun Wash your head With cold water And stay young And fit Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog Swim and move Run and jog Swim and move Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog In the Young Herbalist's Guide Written to make mankind happy One recipe is reiterated The one which contains The secret of youth Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog Swim and move Rest dancing Run and jog Run and jog - Will you please proceed... - Thank you. This is our terrace for representation. Indeed, isn't it pleasant? Your Highness Piller! Envoys from Taledocia. I am glad to welcome the illustrious scientist whose fame has been acknowledged in this country for a long time now and many pills, ointments and concoctions are produced to Mr Blot's recipes. I never part with the hair growth stimulating pills which you invented. I am pleased. Allow me, my honored guest, to take your temperature personally. As a special... distinction. Go ahead, please. Please, go ahead. My temperature maybe higher with excitement, noble Piller. Thirty seven and four... It's quite high! Steward, would you please administer an aspirin And a glass of mullein brew to drink with it. An aspirin... Thank you very much... Here you are. To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Both Phamacies. - Thank you! - To your health, professor. It will do you a world of good. Here it is! Here it is! I've got what I was looking for! Ink! Real ink! We did it! Just look! What color... Ink! Unfortunately, my illustrious guest, it's only fennel root brew. It looks like ink, but it lacks shelf life qualities. Its specific property is that upon rejuvenation it evaporates and disappears. Unbelievable! Professor, would you do me the honor of having lunch with me? With pleasure. Pharmates, take care of our visitors, feed them and show them the sites of our today's celebrations. Lead the way. - Help yourself, please. - We have excellent herb drinks. - This is for you, Pete. - Lavender juice, mint juice. - Help yourself. - Hawthorn juice. One moment. - Fennel brew. - Enjoy! - Poppy seed juice. - Help yourself. Tasty... and healthy!. - Hibiscus juice. - Fresh. And this is the list of dishes I propose for starters: aloe chops and linden flower salad. Wort soup follows. Then comes the entrée: linseed doughnuts with mint sauce and the very healthy nettle cream. For desert melissa, pigweed and horsetail - and sage beverages. - Sage... I know you wouldn't touch these tidbits even on a deserted island, professor. But they are meant only for with stomachs used to a herb diet. Forgive me the trick I used to talk with you in private, but I'd like your advice on a subject of a secret which keeps worrying me... since three days. You must have noticed I am worried enough to be sleepless and without appetite. Indeed, indeed. I'll reveal the reason to you, but we must leave the palace and take the underground corridor to a hiding place located at small distance. If I may, a welcome wreath. If I may, I'll reveal the secret that is worrying me on our way. Calling center. Calling center. This is the center. Center, where are you? This is the center. You will immediately proceed to Horror Ridge square BE-4. You know colonel, the old doter begins to have some suspicions. How about that! And that red haired monster keeps spying on me. In my opinion under the circumstances we should... Hold him! - You little spy! - Shut up! Be quiet! Be quiet... Be quiet... That's it. - Careful, professor. - Yes, of course. It's not far now. Let's go. This is the hiding place of the former ruler of Patentnonia And here he is. The Archmechanic! Ambrose! How are you! How are you, my dear. I never thought we would meet under conditions so unfavorable for me. I must say, however, that your sight inspires me with hope. But let me tell you of my dramatic experiences. I know of then from Mr Piller. To see you is a great joy, Ambrose. I know your courage, ingenuity and how brave you are. Ever since I came to Apothecary Peninsula I never stopped thinking of how to free Inventors Island. My desire is not unrealistic, as I possess a transmitter allowing me to get in touch with the central computer of the system. I need a few hours to develop a reasonable operation plan. It's OK, it's only Prot the apothecary, who regularly supplies my food. I'd like to know where was hidden the equipment with which you landed in Pharmacy. And I have to see my crew as soon as possible. And then I understood I have to cope with the whole crew of pirates. It wasn't for the first time I have fought with pirates, but these were exceptionally cruel. Victory or death, I thought, and jumped straight in the middle. Forward! Cheers for rejuvenating pills! The pirates were moving forward. There was no retreat. The vital confrontation had come. I threw 3 of them into the sea. 2 aiming a gun at me. Hey, herbalists, listen! They begged me to save their lives... Not far from the Strait of Bad Things Lived through on a cape in a port saloon I hope everybody believes what I say I really acted like a typhoon I am the Flying Dutchman Look at my gladiator's trunk This is Lucy That's Mary And the octopus there Is the monster's sister He's the Flying Dutchman Look at my gladiator's trunk This is Lucy That's Mary And the octopus there Is the monster's sister It's notorious, a girl wherever I go Each of them young, pretty and slim All of the sailors, all of them know Cold girl Yola has cold blood like a fish I am the flying Dutchman Ever scared of even the jaws of a shark This killer whale is Betty and that Hey, herb mixers let me have some wine Cold Yola, I'm sorry, she was not for me When I asked her to dance the tango With me It got hot immediately The carousing went on for four nights Not far from the Strait of Bad Things Lived through on a cape in a port saloon I hope everybody believes what I say I really acted like a typhoon I am the Flying Dutchman Look at my gladiator's trunk This is Lucy That's Mary And the octopus there Is the monster's sister I am the Flying Dutchman Look at my gladiator's trunk This is Lucy That's Mary And the octopus there Is the monster's sister What kind of a habit is that? Gentlemen, a break to do some thinking? To work for the sake of the Empire, loafers. Our wonderful air is only for hard workers, and for the lazy ones we have a surprise. I think you've learned your lesson, brat. And now straighten up, don't stoop. In a moment you'll see the Great Electronic. Gentlemen, the time has come to try our power and our capabilities. Where are Pete and sailor Boniface? They have to be found as soon as possible. Tomorrow we'll start the most difficult part of our voyage. You will be responsible for the crossing of Syrup Island. Apothecary will show you the place for the crossing. We have to land on the other side of the river. There we shall take off for a lone and dangerous flight. This is all I wanted to tell you. Let me know as soon as you have found Pete. I will be at the royal pharmacy. Any questions? Thank you. Too bad you are not with us today, my friend. I am sure you would think of a way to conquer the Great Electronic. Macaroni. Macaroni... Can't you understand, you stupid brat, it's your welfare that is concerned. Anyway, we know everything from Mr Boniface. He's a reasonable and nice boy and I'm sure he will answer our questions. You must tell us the spell of doctor Pai Chi Wo and also what gives Mr Blot his peculiar power and energy. I don't know and even if I did I wouldn't tell you You're stubborn, little rascal. You are not imagining you can fool us, do you? Speak up, sonny, don't make Mr Emperor angry with you. Well? Will you talk at last? Or shall I transform you into an automatic postage-stamps licking machine ? I have a surprise for you, you little red haired monster. You will see a thirteenth generation robot based on the form of your former boss... Philip the barber? Yes, Aloysius. Here he is. Technically he is highly perfect. Yesterday, I deprived him of his compassion circuits. True to life. Philip! Take care of our little rascal. Pete! Pete! Pete! Where can that boy be? It's you, Bonifacye. Have you seen Pete? The boy is reckless, he joined a dance parade and must now be dancing somewhere on the peninsula at one of the bonfires. But don't you worry, you'll find him as soon as all that jolting and skipping is over. Don't move. Touch nothing, everything is high voltage. I must inform you I haven't slept all night. I'm telling you again... don't you worry, professor. We'll try to find the boy before noon today. Recreation on the occasion of our holiday lasted all night. He must have sat at one of the bonfires and now he's sleeping it off. Sure, sure. The important thing now is to carry out your plans It may be even better that we won't expose him to such serious danger. Unless, what I suspect happened. If you find him on the peninsula, tell him to wait for our return. If our expedition fails, send him back to the Kingdom of Taledocia. I'll do as you wish. You have my pillmaking word on it. Here is the boat. Well done, boatswain. This is the island. We have to sail into Guayasil Bay. Hope you like it. Fortelas, what was that? Nothing great, professor. I just had my chance to try the pills which I improved. Rejuvenating pills have an effect underwater too. Look, isn't he sweet and so much younger. Are we arriving? Finally. Now it's only two miles to the Talecraft. Pardon, me first. Be careful. Please, go ahead. At the time when our group was nearing the Talecraft in the underwater kingdom of Queen Aba captain Quaterno began the operation surfacing the ship Apollinaire. - This is the Talecraft. - Amazing! The work of scientists of Inventors Island. - Takes off and touches down vertically. - Vertically? Very good. Careful, careful. Please, gentlemen. To get the ink for Taledocia we have to battle for Inventors Island which has been conquered by the Great Electronic. To that effect I decided to make use of the phenomenon of super-macaroni. This is a new weapon which will help us disable our adversaries. Blown-up, magnified... Here is the battle super-pasta, Taledocia's chance. Off we go. We'll be taking off in a moment. Farewell, professor. - Farewell, noble Piller, see you Mr Prot. - See you. - Remember to take good care of Pete. - See you. Please... Go ahead... Come inside, please. Starting today you'll take over for a period of three days. In the meantime I'll subject myself to some relax treatment. Look at the ideas of our scientists, those prototypes of great inventions. A sorry sight. Here is a blend of a shaver and radio, lighter with a flashlight, a super fly-catcher and other nonsense. Our primary target is to find, catch and imprison the Archmechanic. What's the good of our conquest of Inventors Island and planning to make Patentonia its capital if their favorite leader is on run and may plot against us from a hiding place. Listen to this. The hour of liberating Patentonia from the cruel power of the Great Electronic is near. Do not work on new inventions which will support violence. The return of Archmechanic is near. We must show them the Archmechanic caught and sheepish, then they'll lose their zeal for sneering at our power. Just look... This is the vision of a New World, where people like ourselves will enjoy the esthetic order of geometrical figures. We'll clean the old fairytale dump-heap. This is the central computer of the system interrupting transmission Look, colonel Here is some special news. The border guard alarm system warning! Unidentified flying object nearing the western borders of the island. End of report. Some kind of fairytale spaceship smelling of Mr Blot at a mile's distance is nearing us at great speed. Sound for battle alarm! Strange... Strangely odd... We lost 300 fifth generation robots. A blow right into our most sensitive spot. Emperor, our lasers are unable to shoot down the attacking objects. We must get to know Blot's intentions. For that purpose we have to give some tougher handling to that dirty brat. What? What for? You'll tell us everything, little rascal! No! The central computer to Philip system robot. Your energy stock exhausted. Use emergency feeding to replenish it. Great Electronic to central computer. Of what material are the attacking missiles made? Water... Flour... Eggs... Calamity, the computer's gone mad. Fifth generation robots have a system neutralizing all kinds of missiles. Steel, stone, chemical - all except one. Somebody is throwing dough at us. Great Electronic to central computer. How can we fight back? Boil the dough... Switch on the hot water system... Glorious idea! Genial! Go ahead! Warning for all defense positions! First three safety lines out of fight. Elimination of the basic group of fifth generation robots. All fifth generation robots can be junked. The future of our Empire is with Philip system robots. Central computer to Philip system robot. Energy completed. Warning. Switch off the feeding in ten seconds. Attention, thirteenth generation Philip system robot in danger. Colonel Bubble, you will be personally responsible for his safety. Yes, sir. Possibility of blocking landing. Landing on center platform sector four. Warning, touch down of the object completed. Presenting the coordinates of the landing point. Aloysius Bubble? Follow him, Barnaba. Follow me, gentlemen... to the target! You stay here, Mr Boniface. Sure. So that was you, you rascal! I'll show you. - Barnaba! - Easy! Great Electronic to central computer. Free the scientists. Central computer to copy of transmitter. No compliance with voice pattern. I'm waiting for the basic code. Waiting. In thirty seconds I shut the sluices, switch of feeding, liquidate sector six. Attention, reporting danger in sector six. Aaah, so that's it! Thank you! Thank you so much! Wonderful! Where did you come from? Taledoacia. There are more of us. We have to get out of here as soon as possible. - Finally! - We lost all hope! We are free, after so many months! - Go ahead! - Hurry, gentlemen, I know the code. Warning... At zero signal sector six will be liquidated. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... We have to disable the brain of that stronghold. Fail... Fail... Fail... Failure... Fail... Alice has a cat... Failure... Five, six, pick up sticks... It would be hard to word it otherwise than that your master and protector escaped. Mr Boni-al-face vel Boniface! You betrayed the king of Taledocia and your friends. You should be punished. This time, I will give you a chance. - Well, Boni, Boni... - Little Boniface... I want to drink... Professor! Professor! Pete, Pete my son! I should pull your ears, little rascal. Were you terribly scared? Only a little. Ah, well, you see now. Pete! Pete! Hush, hush, Boniface Yeah, he's gone back to childhood. Who knows, it may be the best way of improving wicked people. Here is our old friend, Aloysius Bubble. An assistant and student of ingloriously remembered Philip the barber. Colonel Bubble, this is the end of your devilish tricks. You're trembling with fear. No, no, no, Mr Bubble, you have to clean your mess first. You will right away sail from port Patentonia on a boat equipped with a cistern and you'll collect the foam of black ink spilled on the surface of the sea. Who was locked up in sector six? Gentlemen, this is Mr Blot. And now, clear hosts, would you please show me where you store your ink and make a few barrels of this precious fluid available to us. Our dignified liberator, we haven't been using ink on Inventors Island for a very long time. All our discoveries we put in trust of our electronic machines called computers. How about that! Why haven't I been told earlier? We were afraid it would chill your zeal. Noble traveler, will you accept this gift from us, in greatest gratitude. It's a very valuable map to make up for all the hardships of your voyages. Thank you. Well, gentlemen, full ahead! To beautiful Taledocia! This was the end of our adventure on Inventors Island. The ship was waiting for us at port and we took it right away to sail to sunny Taledocia. Pete was worried about the ink and the captain was enjoying the treasure our expedition had brought him. In the meantime, I was working on a last surprise. Taledocia! There is the capital ! The time has come to unload the barrels full of ink from your ship. It seems entirely useless, You Royal Highness. Why that? Because these barrels do not contain even one drop of ink. Indeed, not even one, Your Talewriting Majesty. One, two, three, four, five! Six, seven, yes, it's here. Nearer, nearer, nearer. OK, lower it now. Let's drill! Here is Taledocia's real treasure! Ink! Ever since you will never again be short of ink because there are huge resources all over your country. My respects. Pete, my friend, let's go. Long live, great travelers! Great is the power of Blot He can do what others cannot He brings us joy just with one wink And brought us ink And brought us ink Salem aleikum Salem alelkum, professor A cloudy day when shadows grey Make world's bright tints unknown Call me again Talk to me I do not want to be alone On a starless night Nothing is right Joy is away and gone Call me again Talk to me I do not want to be alone I can see lovely golden space Trees in the sun under the spell Of blue meadows in dreams full of grace And hear the song of a pink shell Dancing elephants, carefree sprites Tender monsters, nymphs so frail I see them all every night The pictures out of fairy tales A cloudy day when shadows grey Make world's bright tints unknown Call me again Talk to me I do not want to be alone On a starless night Nothing is right Joy is away and gone Call me again Talk to me I do not want to be alone And then come ships deep in the sea Pearls hidden right down there And shiny circles are with me When I sail toward my memories Secret corridors, sesame gates The scientists' enchanted time I may again participate It all comes back to me in rhymes Take me to Fairyland with you I'll follows you across the deep When you have whispered - go to sleep.
