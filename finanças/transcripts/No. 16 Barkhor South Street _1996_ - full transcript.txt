Start the meeting. Should study the file first. No need to. Then let’s get started. Today goes according to the instructions of the superior. You select and responsible few have come for a conference before the New Year. Because time is limited, let’s speak simply. The day after tomorrow everyone will be preparing for the New Year. Our neighborhood committee will only consist of those scheduled. According to the superior’s instructions we’re in a development process spanning from the central government outward to local subsidiaries. Religions must practice self-management. We must also strengthen the management of temples in this district. So today we’re having a short meeting. We hope that during the New Year period residents and foreigners in various monasteries don’t make any problems mainly to prevent division and disturbances. Temples and residents should also guard against fire risks and theft to prevent bad people from doing damage. That is the purpose of the meeting today. Please welcome Director Qu Jie of the neighborhood committee to talk about specific considerations. Director Rozon will add his comments. Barkhor Neighborhood Committee has jurisdiction over six temples. As usual before the New Year we all want to have a forum. Today I invite you here in order to summarize 1994’s year of community safety and public health affairs and the situation of stability and unity. In 1994 the Party Central Committee is headed by President Jiang Zemin. In Chengguan District in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region and under the direct leadership of the Party Committee our neighborhood, in terms of comprehensive social governance including stability and unity, community safety, public health had better results than in 1993 thanks to the cooperation between the temple management committee and the monks. Last year we were building a new Tibet. There were no problems in maintaining the reunification of the motherland. Right now it’s 1996. Tibetan New Year is coming soon. During New Year please continue to adhere to the principles of patriotism and law and not participate in actions that undermine the unification of the motherland. If someone comes to the monastery to incite anything we must stand clearly and stand firm to continue to uphold the unity of the motherland. Secretary Wang Dui from the Barkhor office mainly about the management of outsiders and items concerning Saga Dawa. Tomorrow will be the 15th on the Tibetan Calendar What should be done in social safety and health Secretary Wang Dui wants to guide us, please pay attention. The reason for today’s meeting is there are four neighborhood committees in our office The other committees have finished their meeting. Below we will follow the rules once per month Have this meeting The first thing - we comrades invite Chu Right now it’s the religious festival Saga Dawa Tomorrow’s the 15th Saga Dawa’s prayers and other religious activities is from the first to the 15th of the Tibetan calendar. Tomorrow is the last day. Comrades, we know that there will be a lot of people tomorrow. Whether it’s Barkhor or Linguo There are many people near the monasteries and officials from Potala. Therefore, we must follow all regulations of the government. In regards to managing foreigners, everyone comes to the city. This is not a grazing pasture. This is not a deserted place. This is a special place so it needs special management. You must abide by this association’s systems For example, there will be a lot of people tomorrow Buddha is fine. Prayer wheels are fine. Since tomorrow’s the 15th, no matter which Buddhist activities are held, due to freedom of religion, you can all boldly participate. No one can stop this. But there’s also things no can do. Such as fighting - this is not allowed. Comrades, tomorrow we must pay attention to public security. This is the first requirement. Second, the number of separatists are not few. Is it called Tibetan Independence? Fundamentally speaking, society is stable. This cannot happen. But it’s important to prevent it. This is the main purpose of the meeting tonight. For those headed to Linguo to turn the prayer wheels, they’ll have to go really early. The earliest time to leave is 3 or 4 o’ clock. At this time, take care of your own property Pay attention to this Comrades who understand the Tibetan language can go back first. I’m finished with what I’m saying. Comrades of Han nationality, please stay here. Come here, come sit down. Come a little closer. Tonight we’re going to have a meeting and post a bulletin. Announcement Tomorrow is the traditional Tibetan festival Saga Dawa. Tomorrow all Tibetans will be devoted to religious activities. Our Han comrades all have set up stalls. It was the same when we had a religious holiday last year. This is also true during the Tibetan calendar. You do your selling. This can protect our security personnel. Am I right? You can safely do your business. But I hope that you don’t want If beggars come by, don’t harass them. You focus on doing your own business. There are also many people coming from every direction. It makes no sense to stop them. Let’s remember the issue of national unity at this time. We have to bear in mind that our Han comrades have been liberated for longer than Tibetans. Our enlightenment is also greater than that of the Tibetans so it’s best to not be disruptive here. A little thing becomes a big thing. It’s hard to say by then, right? These are the things often encountered during riots on Balang Street. So why are we having a meeting tonight? It’s for the purpose of safety. Bajiao Street is safe. Every day of the past wasn’t filled with riots and trouble. This is over. There are three reasons for this A party leader Second, the support and emphasis of the people Third, the efforts of the workers In this way, good success has been achieved. These fourteen days Tomorrow too From this time to tomorrow let’s be safe at home. This is definitely achievable. But we must be vigilant. Now the struggle between riots and anti-rioting is long-term. Complicated. Pointed. Right? When the enemy wants to make trouble this is something you know. So don’t be afraid of this. The dictatorship of the proletariat is powerful. They won’t have very good results. It’s mainly about this Saga Dawa. Nothing else. After you receive the notice from the neighborhood committee Thank you for participating actively in this committee. We’re done now. Which temple did you come from? Sima Temple. What’s your name? Xian Longda. How old are you? 12 years old. When did you come to Lhasa? 20 years ago. Pay extra attention to this area. Alright. Don’t want any problems. Alright. Shared between us two. Each person gets eight. No change needed. Sister, give me some change. Ah Duo, do you have change? Giving you twenty one. Who am I to turn away a rich man’s chump change? Giving you two hundred. The rest should be in separate installments. Just like the account book coming from the hospital. 830 yuan Didn’t have a money bag again. 1580 yuan Here Just like this Hello. What? Hospital. Okay. Is it right? It’s right. Is it all directions? It’s all directions. We only counted once last time. You see what else needs to be moved. The last time I bought Jiu Ru and Ba Ru were six yuan. Ah Ru six yuan. This is the old price. Ba Ru is eight yuan. The only thing to move in Tang Chema. These three. No change on the raw material. Because this is the original medicinal material. Now only these three types of money are a bit inconsistent. Ah Ru used to be how much. How much does it cost to buy Ah Ru? Buy it alone. If you buy it separately I don’t know. It used to be about 30 yuan. What is the owner’s name? What is the owner’s name? I’m not sure. Be sure to remember the owner’s name in the future. Bring other people’s ID cards tomorrow. Okay. How long will it be here? How long do you go through the formalities? I have been here for two months. No, how much longer do you want to live here? I can’t understand. Speak Mandarin. Residence permit is still a few months away. One month residence permit. Two months. One month. One month. Heard it can only be done for one month. “Old fart.” That’s what my kids call me. “Old fart, if you don’t have anywhere to go, you can just stay with me and screw around here.” It’s not that I have no home. I could go stay with another one of my kids. It’s just that she lives too far away. If I don’t live here I don’t have time to turn the prayer wheels. Old people can only turn prayer wheels. No point in anything else. So what I want to tell you is I want to borrow a house to live in alone in order to have some peace and quiet. They’re arrogant to me. I can’t stand it. Renzeng, not today. I will call you this afternoon. There is another meeting in the morning. Sister Zayang is here. At noon I’ll entrust someone to give you some news. Secretary, I just ask you to do me a favor. Okay, come here tomorrow. Hoe much should she get? How much should I get? By rule, this should be decided by the parents. They don’t care. That Kham man is too busy. He can’t be dealt with. I take care of my own things. She takes care of her own things. Kham people can’t be dealt with. Then come tomorrow. Today isn’t possible. Too much work already. Okay. The Kham can’t do anything about it. I’ll move out after I get my things. If you don’t move… Where do you live? Right nearby. Just right nearby. Just to the side. Are you going to be at home today? Yes. You come back later. Right now it’s ten thirty. Come back at eleven thirty. I’ve already reported it to the committee. Divided my things. What’s mine should be mine. What’s hers should be hers. Then I’m renting a walking tractor. Get some helpers and move out. I can’t live with them. Not at all. Thank you Secretary. Come back at eleven thirty. Please take this matter to heart. Thank you. Thank you. Come this afternoon. Alright. Five hundred and what? Five hundred and two dollars and thirty five cents. Do you want to tell her about the National People’s Congress? What? Notice of the National People’s Congress. Yes, they were here this morning. Tell her. President of the Higher People’s Court of Lhasa today. Another comrade is here too. Regarding the house. This dispute has been going on for around ten years. Seems to be so. Is it Ten East Street? Yes. What’s the landlord’s name? Landlord. The name of the landlord is unknown. His dad is a Japanese foreigner. After the indicted individual reported to the National People’s Congress Another document came from the National People’s Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee So they came to talk about the problem with the house. Basically it’s this way Who said this? It’s possible he himself knew already. If yes, then say yes. If no, then say no. No. This isn’t what the court said. That’s what they said on their side. They didn’t say it. This is just a rumor. If yes, then say yes. If no, then say no. Two hundred and… Two hundred and forty two yuan and three cents Finished. Finished. There are two kinds of rhino horns: dry and wet. In Chinese, it’s African rhino horn and Asian rhino horn. In Tibetan, it’s gang rhino, lun rhino Also called srugangani The dry ones are few. They’re black. The wet ones are white colored. Uncle is here. Please sit here. Alright. Sit for a while first. Your account isn’t settled yet? Soon. When it’s done, treat us to tea. They’re still using my things. Really not shy about it. Kham people just need food in order to stand on the ground. He said in the morning, “Bring the hand tractor here.” Didn’t they go just now? When they went, the daughter and son-in-law were at home. The daughter said that her father and her were the same household… No. I’m never living with them again. I found the house I want to live in. I can’t live with them. What’s the point? In the afternoon, they don’t even give me a bowl of tea. Where? Which neighborhood committee? Over there. Over there? Is it borrowed? Yes. Do you live alone? Yes. Younger daughter often comes to see me. Where is she? She has work. She lives with her husband. Besides her, no one helps me. Did your kids agree yet? Ah, them. They have to agree. You see. They said so to me. “Old fart. If you have nowhere to go, just live with me.” She even said, “You damn old man.” This was said many times. And there’s that nosy Kham. He said, “Old man, if you’re gonna go, then go.” He has no household registration. He looks down on me like this. Bullies me like this. I’m too angry. Who helps you financially? Oh, financially. No one helps me. Uncle has a freight trike. Yes. I send the money earned from that to my children in the mainland. I use what remains for myself. Yes. Old people don’t spend a lot. I can’t control my mouth. Every day I must drink some qingke barley wine. There’s no qingke barley wine that won’t sell at two dollars. Yes. It won’t be sold. The price went up. No wonder with the wine vendors every time I go drink I have to ask the price first. You can look at this. If I had a choice, I wouldn’t take these away. I won’t quarrel with them. Kneaded tsampa pouch. Right. Buy some qingke barley wine. If you want to eat tsampa then eat it. If you want to eat tsampa porridge then eat it. This has to be carried. What our neighborhood committee means is if you have a great enough desire then we’ll mediate. I beg you. It’s irreconcilable. If it can’t be reconciled - You want to separate from your kids This is not a decision made by our neighborhood committee. Of course not. Coming to the neighborhood committee is like a kid crying in front of their parents. I really can’t argue with them. So I want to get my share. They can get their share. You can’t get a house in the future? This house is divided into four parts. But if you want to separate, we also can’t interfere. But in the future I won’t have extra housing to give you. Okay. Give her what’s hers. I get what’s mine. Things haven’t been divvied up? No. I came here just to report on this matter. Is it to let us help you divide things? Yes. I’ll send someone over at three thirty in the afternoon alright? Okay. Also, when things are being divided up, don’t quarrel. Okay. I’ll go to the neighborhood committee and make this request. Whatever the committee decides, I’ll obey. I don’t wish to quarrel and I can’t manage quarreling with them. They’re too capable. Send someone in the afternoon. The neighborhood committee can’t speak on what belongs to who. Mainly they will negotiate it themselves. I’m asking you to do a notarization. She’ll walk away with hers. I’ll walk away with mine. If we were to be like others, things would have been divided by the parents. The neighborhood committee can’t say, “You take this.” Daughter is left with this. Yes. Because the committee doesn’t know your family like that. So let your daughter think about it. Uncle, you think about it too. My request is as such and there’s nothing extraordinary about it… That’s it. Thanks then. Secretary, please take this matter to heart. Okay. I finally settled the dispute now. I even thought… Uncle, your cane. Food coupons are to be used by a registered house. The place you live at has no house number. If there’s no house number there’s no way to separate things. Only when that’s determined is it possible. Well that’s all. Okay. Come this afternoon. We’ll send someone to go with you. Thank you. Otherwise there really is no hope. Their words are all lies. They want to confuse me. Honestly, Uncle is hopeless. Uncle had better move away. Gave him a freight trike. He lives on this. Separating is a disadvantage for him. There’s no money left either. Yes. Having the freight trike is enough for him. He says there’s no need for mediation. Kids are so bad. Recently the daughter said she wanted to divorce the Kham. Came to us. Because the Kham has no registered residence. Divorce is false. Later came running back to the committee again. Threw her two kids here. She said, “You watch them.” Then she just went out the door. Let’s sit down and start adding words Please look at page sixty four. How many kinds of additive words are in here? We’ve already written it. Let’s review it first. These two are very similar. You must pay attention. Or should we read it together? I read one. You all read one. Are you ready? Ready? What place? That one. Did you notify the criminal investigation? Yes, it’s done. It’s a very big case. It’s over ten thousand. It can’t be like this. This is already the fourth case. Yeah. Need to deduct five hundred from you. You need to tell security what happened with them last night. If you want to deduct from me, I’ll deduct from theirs. That’s not my business. Anyway I’m deducting yours. Have things inside been moved? They’re moved. They took all these out. No one lives here. The rule says that if the store has a door outside someone must sleep inside. Really bad luck. Go and make a call. You don’t have anyone living here at night do you? No. Why not? Already told you everything. Someone must sleep inside. Can’t leave it unrented. It’s like this. It already has a iron gate. Later… This is finable. You were told about this a while ago. At night there needs to a person on duty. Staying here. The things that were thrown out were worth more than ten thousand right? More than ten thousand. Didn’t I help you out before? Have to stay here at night. If I’m going to be fined Then I’ll fine this market I don’t care about that. Your salary must be deducted. I’ve notified you many times before. Someone needs to be there at night. What’s the use of an iron gate? Yes. Totally useless. Hello? Secretary. Nang Rexia’s people haven’t come yet. We’re verifying the hospital bill. Okay. Last time they said they’d cut the price in half. Did they do it? Before, it wasn’t even forty cents. After recalculating, it should be more than thirty cents. Quarreled yet? The father has his own reasons. The daughter also has her own reasons. How is it right now? There’s no way to immediately divide things. Uncle didn’t bring his helpers. Right now we’re going to divide things up. We don’t have any way I asked them to get their family together. Round up all the relatives. Let them discuss how to divide their own things. The committee can’t say this belongs to the father, this belongs to the daughter. So let them work it out together. I said there must be no accidents. This is how I solved it. When I went in the morning she said to get all the relatives together. I said it’s better not to separate. Let’s mediate. You also talked to Father. He’s getting on in years. If no one’s accompanying him he could have an accident. The daughter has said this to her father. But he doesn’t listen. He’s stubborn. That’s the main problem with old people. The daughter said, “Who was it that helped you find housing?” Get her here. Who was it that encouraged you? Get her over here. Who let you live separately? Get her over here. It’s best for them to solve things by themselves. Yes. Today’s quarrel isn’t a put-on. It’s real. The father called his daughter a prostitute. Daughter said her father’s an old fart who should die. Who should’ve died a long time ago. Mother raised us by tending cattle. This time it isn’t acting, it’s a real fight. That old man is quite arrogant. That Kham. Right. He didn’t say a word in the morning. He only eats instant noodles but thinks he’s somebody. What to do? An old man. Hello? Barkhor Neighborhood Committee? Who? Bianba.

You said you didn’t go with them to sell the rugs. I did go when they sold the rugs. You were there. Yeah. I wasn’t there when they sold the generator. A power generator? One power generator. Yeah. They started stealing three years ago. I haven’t even been here for three years. And then? I stole woolen cloth. What? Woolen cloth. A roll of woolen cloth. Where did you steal from? Steal the cloth.

Third Plenary Session to the Twelfth National Congress. This period is the development stage. We all know that the development period is like pregnancy. Speaking in Chinese is the stage of gestation. This is the first. The second is establishment stage. When is this? From September 1982 to 1987 This is the Twelfth Party Congress The five year period of the Thirteenth National Congress is the time to build a theoretical system. Socialist development stage. The Thirteenth National Congress pointed out Chinese socialism. What stage are you in? At the initial stage of socialism This is emphasized in the constitution of the Fourteenth Party Congress. This made mistakes in policies and routes before A detour was taken, and the reason is development stage. No correct understanding. Thought it had reached the highest stage. It seems that communism is coming soon. The actuality is that we’re still on the ground. Thought we had reached the sky and knew all. Because of this, we took the wrong path. In the past we used to think this way We do socialism. It was thirty years before we had elementary socialism. Why? There’s such a saying. Right? Socialism after so many years. Socialism started in 1956 By 1990, it had basically been thirty or forty years. How did we get to the primary stage after thirty years of work? This is the ideological understanding at the time. But re-emphasize and recognize the development stage. After recognizing the development stage What stage are we? The primary stage of socialism. Or a lower level. There are two kinds of references in radio and newspaper. The pants belong to the Han. Not her. She stole the pants and accused me of doing it. I met the Han once. I told her, “Your pants are gone.” People said I stole them. If something goes wrong, I’m going to complain. Then I’ll call you and you’ll have to come. You’re a witness. You know who stole them. Did you quarrel over in the garden? Just right over there. Right by the police station. She provoked us first. Throwing rocks at us. At the time I’d put things at the door. Basang came out of the bathroom. Spit at me. Called me a thief. I asked what I stole. Don’t call me a thief for no reason. Aren’t you ashamed? You stole the pants yourself. You still wronged me. All the business owners know. She’s the one who stole it. One day when we were arguing I said Basang, despite accusing me of stealing my goods haven’t arrived yet. When they arrive, you can come to my house and see. If they’re your pants, I’ll give you ten thousand yuan. If they’re not, then you’ll give me ten thousand yuan. Then she said to forget it. Never came to find me. Her husband even said sorry. You speak first. You guys speak first. It’s you who provoked us first. Who provoked you? Don’t lie. Hey. Hey. I didn’t steal. You didn’t steal anything. Don’t lie! You two are so noisy. Says you. Auntie you don’t understand what’s going on. You’ll be punished by the gods. Slow down first. I have a lot I want to say. You bitch. She’s the bitch. I want to say something. You call me a prostitute. What evidence do you have? What’s the three thousand yuan about? It’s not like that. Mima, don’t lie. Let me talk. Let me talk. You weren’t called here to fight. One person speaks at a time. Haven’t gone to your neighborhood committee. Let’s go. Go. Stop arguing. Stop arguing. Do you hear me? Only one of you talks at a time. After you started quarreling I’ve become confused. One person speaks at a time. I came back from the hospital yesterday. Walked over by the garden where they sell apples… Prostitute’s client. Bitch Don’t talk yet. My mom passed. When I came back that day, I made it to my mom’s funeral. Then she came. Her mom came too. Guna was sleeping. In Barkhor there’s someone called Abu Tenzing. She said that I slept with him. He gave me a gold ring with a cat’s eye gem. Yeah. I wore that. Actually, I’d lent him five hundred yuan for airplane tickets. He used this for his mortgage. I totally don’t understand that person. Auntie listen to me. She said to Guna “Your wife slept with the Kham and got a ring.” That’s what was said. Guna, are you here? Here. I’m here. She told Guna this. That’s enough. Bitch. You see, Brother Weidong. Won’t let me talk. Say it. Say it. Later she fought with me again. Wait. You guys came here. This is about the pants right? Yes. Not just the pants. She’s too unreasonable. She called me a thief. If not about the pants, then what’s it about? You spent a hundred dollars in Chengdu hiring gangster women. You don’t need a hundred dollars. It’s her who fought with those prostitutes. I have no time to deal with these things. You know that? Don’t you believe in Buddha? You have to be honest. What are you doing, hiding behind your wife? It’s not heroic to help your wife fight. You punk. You’re the punk. Everyone knows. You’ve never stolen, you’ve never robbed. Don’t be like this. This won’t solve the problem at all. You go back first. You guys, fighting like this How you were beaten. Write it all down. Write clearly and send it here tomorrow. Tomorrow I’m going to Chengdu. Tomorrow I can’t. You can come in the afternoon too. Write it now. We’re all here in the afternoon. You bring the written materials. You can’t solve the problem like this. Hear me? You see? Right away, he calls me a prostitute. How am I obscene? Let him show the evidence. Go home first. Go home. Go home. If you want to talk, talk reasonably. How can you just call someone a prostitute? Your wife just got out of jail. Punk. You went to jail because you stole things. Don’t say words like a prostitute’s client. Even if someone else insulted you, don’t return the insult. Saying all these curses won’t solve the problem. Moreso, this is a neighborhood committee. You’re in the neighborhood committee pointing fingers. Can you solve any problems? Do you want to flout the rules? You’re outsiders. You’re the committee’s constituents. Guna, you just open your mouth and call someone a bitch. A bitch. What’s the purpose of saying this? What’s the point of a man saying this? They work hard and feel pain too. What’s the meaning of it? She’s unreasonable. Even if they’re unreasonable let them speak. What’s the matter, you listen first. Don’t retort now. Four thousand eight hundred The pants were stolen by her the same year that my mother died. At the time, we both stayed in one room. Guna said I didn’t keep my things safely. Forget saying these things. There’s no point. This is correct. Two women fighting. You should discourage it. Right? But you aren’t like this. You start saying bitch. Bitch. This doesn’t solve the problem. She framed me for stealing three thousand yuan. She said you stole. Then did you steal? I didn’t steal. That day I was in the bathroom. I wasn’t done when small rocks started hitting me on the head. Just forget about the past. Basan when she hired those gangster women to beat you That person Ge Ruxia can’t testify can they? Yes. Ge Ruxia has a man named Jian Zan Qun Pei. How’s this then? Forget it from now on. We of the committee educate ourselves. We’ll also go find their committee. Let them teach themselves. After today, whoever wants to make trouble will be fined or sent to the police station. Whoever’s making trouble You should advise her first, but you aren’t like this. The other side says something to you. Then you say bitch. Bitch. If she asked you to come up with evidence Do you have evidence? No. She said you stole three thousand yuan. And even broke the glass. Did you? No. All of this is nothing. You must be careful. If you can avoid it, then avoid it. Right now everyone’s confused and contradictory. If there’s another quarrel in the future We’ll send the both of you over there. This result will be bad then. Am I right? You better think about it. We can’t survive anymore. He beats me often. One day I’ll be beaten to death. If you’ve decided, then give me a certificate. I can’t bear it anymore. I want to divorce him. I found the public security bureau. They asked me to find the neighborhood committee. If you’re a constituent of our neighborhood committee we can give you a certificate. We can also mediate. Husband and wife are fighting. How could we decide on that? You’re husband and wife. A couple is a couple. But he often doesn’t come home. This time it’s been over a month. He comes and goes as he pleases. Last night he hit me again. The neighbors all saw. Where do you live? How come you came here and then hid in the back? All the good things have come together today. You said you can get a certificate. Is that Kham is still hiding in the back and laughing? That other group has made a decision. She said I live in the new mansion She said she wants to divorce so I said Sister Sejin, are you the female director? Then you can get a divorce if you want. I’ll come see how things are split up.

Comrade Ye Jing, Propaganda Minister, Chengguan District Party Committee Comrades from the Organization Department also came to this meeting I sincerely thank them. The 74th anniversary of the Party will be celebrated by the following First, party members prepare to take an oath in front of the party flag. Raise your fist. I volunteer to join the Chinese Communist Party. Support the Party’s program. Abide by the Party’s regulations Party member’s obligations Implement the Party’s decisions. Strictly observe the Party’s discipline Maintain a disciplined hold. Loyalty to the Party. Work actively for the cause of communism. Very troublesome. I need to paint it again. And it can only hang for one day. As soon as it rains it’s done for. That one’s done. Just don’t drop it. Apply a bit more here. Managing one’s tools is the responsibility of every citizen. Cleared then. Cleared. Do I just need an ID card? Need two photos. Need two photos huh. Do you have the old one? I have an old ID. Then that’s one photo. Do you want to re-do two photos? There’s one on the old ID. Just get one more and it’s fine. Need two photos. Puci, quickly gather three photos of the trike. We’ll use them in these two days. Can the trike be rented to Hans? The trike can’t be rented to Hans. If it’s rented to them it’ll be confiscated. Just rent it to Tibetans. Then you better hire a Tibetan. Master wants to use the ID? Yes. You must have an ID to rent the trike. I lost my ID. Can’t do it without an ID. The owner of the trike and the driver both need ID. Doesn’t matter who it is. No rental without an account. Today we want to clear something up. Things were the same until December. The management fee paid to the neighborhood committee is still the same. Next year we need to revisit the allocation. Everyone must obey the distribution. Right now our committee has twenty five needy households. Take care of them. Everyone needs money. Didn’t Sister Jia Lu come? Is she at home? Get her, quickly. Brother Sambu is 341? Yes. And Uncle? Luosang Tenzing. Is the trike still around? No. What happened? Sold it. It’s been sold so there’s nothing to be done about it. Can’t be helped. All the trikes that we have have been rented out. It’s like this. No ownership changes this year. Starting next year, current owners will be replaced with new ones. Last time, I also said that next year there’d be an ownership change. Because our committee has more than twenty families in need trikes should be issued to them. Or two to three families can share a trike. So those heads of household can do their registration and get seals of approval here. Did you bring your application? No. I did. Let me see. Who’s driving Sister Jia Lu’s trike? A Han. Han people aren’t allowed to drive trikes now. Is it your son-in-law? My son-in-law is a Han. Is he the one driving or is it someone else? It’s another Han. Han people aren’t allowed to drive trikes now. Have to be Tibetan. Let Pu Buciren help him find a driver. Everyone has rented their trikes out. No one drives their own trike. So the superiors have said only Tibetans can rent them. Sunday morning at nine. We want to double check your application and photos. After the committee gives their seal of approval, the office will then give theirs. The head of the household and the driver went to apply for a license. Secretary, I beg you. My trike has been sold… Okay. I’ll notify the trike service company first. But all the sold trikes were confiscated. We can’t do anything. My mom is a farmer and she’s old too. And I have to care for mother-in-law. I’ve nothing else that I can do. It’s hard to get by on a woman’s sewing income. And without any other income. I’ve never been through this and have to bother you now. Right now I have no work. Please report it to your superiors. Head of the household - write your name and attach your photo. This year it’s this way. Later it may differ. Can we let them take away the letter of introduction? We can. They still have to go to the office to stamp it. You can do it by yourself. Ah Sang. Chago. Awang Sambu. You tell them everyone is here. None of these people work? No. None of them have a cent’s worth of income. What are you preparing? It’s for them. Or should the committee help them manage themselves. That won’t work. No one works at Uncle Tashi’s house. You guys talk about it first. Make a list of profile summaries. One person, one summary. I’ll go to these people’s homes and inspect things first. You need to check every household. The authorities will send someone to check again. This time there has to be solid action. Last year we didn’t have enough experience so we had a lot of trouble. I have a little experience this time. How would it be possible for us to do it wrong this time? We have to take control of these situations. Go and see tomorrow. Let them wait at home. No. No. I’ll go see first. When the superiors come, let them see them again. I’ll do a quick check first. I’ll know if any of these families are in trouble. They’ll also say to me it’s not that I don’t believe in the committee I let Rosang Kampot also be responsible for the two neighborhood committees We’ll split up and both see. If there’s a problem in the future, the committee will take responsibility. The management office will also take responsibility. I can’t come. There’s a lot of people here. Where are you going? Dragon Lake? Everyone’s watching how we’re dividing up the bikes. Should give it to them. No one in their house can go to Guma. This is conducive to social stability. Beneficial to our work too. People will say that the Communist Party is very practical. Honestly. I don’t know their living standards. Come and see. Later on, you’ll have some experience. Qu Jie. Did you go? I won’t butt in further. How disgusting. How do you have nothing serious to say? Let them relax a bit on the knife business. Don’t immediately confiscate it. The Public Security Bureau will send a notice tomorrow Director Wang wants to make a speech. Also wants to sent out a publicity outline. Then we’ll get on with the great development. The other side said to slow down. Ah. Don’t confiscate anything yet. If there were no murders. No murder. What happened to Jia Lu? I went to drink tea just now. I’d heard that my brother-in-law had come to find me. So I came immediately. We let you come in the morning. Why didn’t you come? When I sobered up, I didn’t dare come. Are you still drunk? I don’t dare come here when I’m sober. So if you were drunk you could come here? I was drunk… Then you might fight with me. What were you doing, going there after drinking? No. It’s not like that. In the afternoon I felt… Really. You never learn your lesson. You were almost fatally stabbed once right? What’s wrong with you? Tell me. Yesterday night I went to my sister’s… Sit there. I went to my sister for money. My brother-in-law said they weren’t trying to be mean to me. Said a bunch of things like this. Then he grabbed me and took me to the neighborhood committee. Zhou Zheng Nima said, “Elder brother, don’t be like this.” Brother-in-law asked if I was an accomplice. The two of them started quarreling. I wasn’t an accomplice. The two of them almost started fighting. No knives. Only a small rock. When that was brought out, my brother-in-law ran away. Later Sister came. Sister said to go to the neighborhood committee I said okay. Let’s go. I heard you wanted to bring out a knife. It wasn’t a knife. They lie. I swear. You can ask Tenzing Nima. There’s a person nicknamed Blind Guy. It was him. We heard you were trying use a weapon. I swear to the gods I didn’t. Really. You were drunk and went to someone’s house looking for trouble. Didn’t you say if you weren’t drunk, you’d never dare to go there? I let you come here and you’re still like that. When you’re drunk there’s nowhere you don’t dare to go to. Your partner is really nosy. Come in. What is it friend? Be gentle. This isn’t solid. What is it? I’d like to know the case status. Qu Jie’s. Yes. It has to nothing to do with him. I just asked. He said he’s not the one who introduced them. He said he didn’t. This is nonsense. I went with Tsering Dunzhu and he said the same story. He says that if it wasn’t him that made the introduction, what’s he to do? Maybe there’s a problem here. Are the things there? Whether the money’s been stolen. Who knows? A color TV, video recorder, and tape recorder were stolen. Ask first if Qu Jie was the one who made the introduction. Otherwise his words might come back to bite you. Then let’s go. Heard he moved. Please have some tea. Qu Jie said he never introduced them. Was there a fight? It’s concerning his sister and the house. Do you know him? He’s Barkhor’s hero. We caught him once. He’s * Last time he almost bled to death. That time we * opened. Opened? This is what he said. Do you have many sons? Many. I’m dizzy. There’s been a lot these past few days. Really bad. Thanks. Goodbye. Jia Lu what are you going to do? If I was at my sister’s already I’d be drunk. You basically know everyone at the police station right? Do you know them? Yeah, I know them. Tell me, was your behavior wrong last night? Wrong. What? Wrong. Wrong. How was it wrong? Tell me clearly. Your sister says she wants to help you. She said that to the committee. If you change, you’ll get a place to live. Everyone’s good to you. You should talk. Going out and working is good too. Doesn’t matter what kind of work. Live your life well. Your sister already promised to let you come back. You two were adopted right. It stands to reason to be sister and brother. But what are you doing? Stealing things. Fighting. Entering the police station is commonplace. It’s not like the committee doesn’t care about you. We gave you a trike. But you blew that. You sold it for two hundred yuan right? Six hundred yuan. Sold it for six hundred yuan. Had you kept the trike you could have rented it out if you couldn’t drive it. Could have made nine hundred yuan a month. Right? Yes. This way, you can live your life. Know that? Jia Lu I’m telling you this won’t work. You know that going on this way we’ll be meeting in prison next. Don’t be like this Jia Lu. What’s your actual name? Dawa. Dawa. Yes. How old were you when you came to Lhasa? Three. Three. How old are you now? Twenty eight. Twenty eight? Yes. If you were someone else, you’d be a dad already. Not to mention other things. What are you going to do? After today, what will you do? Be good. How will you be good? Elaborate. I won’t go to my sister’s and search for alcohol. I won’t fight. I can’t quit drinking even if I wanted. Drink a bit less. But not drunk. Not fighting anymore. Go clean shoes. In the morning I’ll go to the teahouse and clean shoes. Today we had a good talk. We better not meet again. You better not come here again. If you have any difficulties, find a job. You can also talk to the committee. The committee works in the public’s interests, you know that? It’s not like we don’t know about people like you. You go to other neighborhood committees and if they want to collect money or charge land fees you can report this kind of thing to us. We will plead for you. The main content of tonight’s meeting is Preparations to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region On September 1st, the masses are going to the Potala Palace Square for a meeting We counted the residents who have hukou and houses. Also reported this to the superiors. For the elderly and disabled people it’s inappropriate to go to the meeting Those under eighteen years of age also can’t go to the venue. Those who have had political problems can not attend the conference. When to start, how to get there, how many attendees and the state of order at the venue. All of these must be clearly discussed. The number of us that will go to the venue is 336 people So in this case, we have 601 households. These people must participate. Because of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region is a very auspicious day. A group leader for every ten people attending the conference. Each leader must take care of their ten conference attendees Don’t let outsiders enter our teams. Discipline should be observed during the meeting. No noisiness. This is what every group leader is responsible for. Everyone going is Tibetan and must wear Tibetan clothing. We ask that everyone wear nice and new clothing. If you deliberately put on worn out clothing that day it will be said to be a political problem. The one who suffers is yourself. So everyone please take this seriously. Our locations have been divided Where is our city gate Each unit has its own area. Even in areas one, two, three. Let us sit wherever they choose for us to sit. If you need to relieve yourself, go to the designated toilets. If you act otherwise, this is a big meeting with tens of thousands Acting disruptive isn’t allowed. Drink a little tea in the morning. We don’t know what the situation is like over there either Maybe everyone sits quietly and takes turns to relieve themselves. Maybe the toilet can’t be found anywhere So everyone pay attention. If you can endure, then endure it. If you really need to go, and things aren’t working out there This easily causes disruption. You’re here for the meeting, not the bathroom. If you cause a problem then it counts as a political problem. So when we go, please observe the discipline of the venue. All guests, comrades, friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region starting now. Subtitles by Ellie!!!!!
