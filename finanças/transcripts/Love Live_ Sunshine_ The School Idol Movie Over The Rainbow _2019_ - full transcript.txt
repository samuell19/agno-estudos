Amazing! It flew up so high! Next up is Chika-chan. All right. I can do it too. Go! I think it should have flown a little higher. Chika-chan, try again. Have another go! Okay! Is this... ---yours? Yep. That's right. Can you fly it higher? I sure can. Much higher. I'll make it fly past the rainbow! We danced well. One more time! In this school, together with everyone from Aqours! You know what? We have something to say. To Chika... - And everyone else. Something you want to say? - What is it? - Zura? That's right! This is regarding our future as the third year students and Aqours too. The future. Have they left? All right. Let's go back and practice! That's right. Although the six of us will go to a new school, Aqours will continue. That's right. It was a unanimous decision! - You seem motivated, zura. - Giran! As usual, you really don't get what's going on, zura. You're so annoying! What's wrong? Where... are we going to practice? Do you have to ask? It's at the usual place. Oh, that's right. We can't use the school. What about the practice space in front of the station? We agreed to use it only until the Love Live! competition. What? So what should we do, zura? Should we try asking Mari? Maybe she knows a place we can use. Chika-chan? Let's look for a place by ourselves. I feel as if... ...things won't work out if we rely on others. We're starting over with us six members, after all. So, we have to work it out between the six of us! Don't you agree? Yes. I know! What is it, You-chan? How about going to see our new school? We're starting there in spring. New... ...school? It's quite far away, isn't it? It seems like a big school, judging from the number of students. Huh? Is there really a school here? What? It's... it's so old, zura. You, did you make a mistake? But it's in the message the school sent us. "Seishin High School" "Uranohoshi students must gather here for the entrance ceremony." "Seishin High School" "Uranohoshi Girls' High School branch school" Branch school?! This is unacceptable! It seems that some don't wish to be... ...associated with Uranohoshi High School. So, they want to run it as a branch school for the time being. For that reason, they borrowed a primary school... ...that was not in use for the Uranohoshi students. And they had only one class until now. We may be restructuring, but being transferred to a school that's closing down... ...is pointless, isn't it, zura? And if the third year students graduate... ...and are put in the same classroom as Ruby... Good mor...ning! Welcome to Hell Zone. What do you mean? We can't study like that. School Idol activities can't be carried out either. But why were there protests about being in the same school? Come to think of it, where is You-chan, zura? Oh yeah, you're right... She's not here, is she? She was sitting over there a while ago. Unless I'm mistaken, she had a call... No way. Zura? What's wrong? T-There's nothin to see, zura. The little demon was just making a ruckus. Calm down. What are you hiding? That's right. What did you see? Nothing. Nothing, truly! It's better for you not to see. - That's right, zura! And why's that? She probably... ...found us some cute outfits! W-Wait! A dream? That's right, this is a dream. That's right, it's a dream. Indeed. That guy is real. Yes. Maybe he's her brother, zura. Her brother? Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think she has a brother. So, that means... He is You's "Big Demon"! She's looking this way! Why do we need to hide, zura? Because... She's gone. Let's go after her! Good luck. Hey, quit squashing me. She'll hear us, zura. What? It Was just & Ga. That was close. She almost caught us. Yoshiko-chan. Your call could not be connected. No, that's not it. Is something wrong, You-chan? Sorry, Tsuki-chan. Tsuki-chan? Chika-chan? That's right. I haven't introduced you guys. This is my first cousin, Tsuki-chan. I'm Tsuki. Nice to meet you. Don't tell me... That's a girl? What? So, you attend that school? Yup. Before registering, I asked You-chan to come with me, but You-chan said that she wanted to go to the same school as Chika-chan. D-Did I say that? It's not something to be ashamed of. You're Riko-chan, aren't you? Yes. She always talked about you. She said she looks up to you. No way. It's not something to be ashamed of. Chika-chan. Ruby-chan, Hanamaru-chan and Yoshiko-chan. You-chan really seemed to like the Aqours, so she talked about all of you every time we met. I always get the feeling... ...that Aqours has already become a part of You-chan. When you put it that way, I feel quite embarrassed. You has always been like that, zura. She is really straightforward. Why are you looking at me like that?! So, what about the branch school? That's right. How did it turn out that way? Our school has been very active in clubs activity for a long time. Several clubs have even participated at national level. So? When Uranohoshi's students start at our school, the clubs will get sluggish... ...and some of the parents said that it might cause conflicts. No way. Why would it even be that way? I know, right? We students... ...as well as the teachers tried to persuade them not to worry, but... ...they asked us what we would do if the clubs went down, and whether we would take responsibility. I guess it can't be helped if they were saying things like that. So, we discussed what to do. All-out war? Don't be ridiculous. What they are really worried about, is whether Uranohoshi students will participate actively in clubs. So, we should prove to them that we have club achievements too. Club... If you put it that way... A club like that... We have one, don't we? A club that won the national competition. Our School Idol club... ...won't lose out to other clubs at the new school. We will do our best to actively participate in the clubs, and once they change their minds, they will feel reassured. That... That's a good idea! Isn't it? Do you intend to do a live show? That's a good idea, but... ...there's actually a great event coming up next week! T-This is the future, zura! Are we really going? That girl is really competent! She's someone I knew in my previous life. Previous life? It's her classmate from middle school, zura. We're doing this for the school and everyone. I'm nervous. Isn't this place huge, zura? What are you talking about? The Love Live! competition stage was a hundred times bigger! And everyone was there back then. We're also here. Right now. Is this everyone? We didn't think so, but maybe six members... ...isn't enough. You-chan, your group is up next. I especially asked them to give you some time. Do your best. Yes. This is for everyone from Uranohoshi. That's right. It will be fine. We can do it. From zero to one. From one to the next. Aqours... Sunshine! And so, from this spring, these students will merge with this school... ...and Aqours, the School Idol Club from Uranoshoshi Girls High School... ...will perform a live show. This is it. Our first... ...big step forward as the new Aqours. Let's step forward with these six members. With six members. Six members... We failed, didn't We? I can't believe we made a basic mistake like that. And it's not as if we were careless. I just don't feel at ease, zura... ...with just six members. Sis... There they are. Chika! Mu-chan! How was it? As expected, they want to make it a branch school for the time being. Of course. I'm sorry. If we only did it properly... No. You guys didn't do anything wrong. On the contrary, we are the ones at fault. During the closure of our school and this time too, we completely relied on Chika and the others. The truth is, we can't form a club like Chika's that everyone would be proud of. Because there weren't enough members and you played several roles. It's like a swimming club. But... For that reason, all the more we have to do a good job, right? Here. Thank you. Everyone from Uranohoshi understands. That also said that an old school isn't too bad. Rather, we feel as if it suits us better. Right. - Yes, yes. The school suits us, doesn't it? - Yes. Thanks for the grub! Hey, eat slowly. Okay! Six members... I feel its been a long time since we could chat like this. Are you still worried about it? Not really, but... I feel that the School Idol Club... ...is easily misunderstood compared to other clubs. Since we are always smiling on stage, we might appear frivolous. And because we look like we are having fun, they think we are just playing around. Is that so? But the truth is, we dance while we sing. And if people saw that we were uneasy or felt it was hard work, they couldn't enjoy themselves watching us. We definitely can't show them that side of it. I guess not giving up is the only way. Even the Uranohoshi student... ...is trying their best. And the School Idol... ...is doing their best not to lose out to the new school's clubs. I know that, but... I was wondering how we will continue with just six of us. When Mari-chan and the others said that we should continue with just six of us, I agreed with them. I said "Let's do this!", and felt that I'd do my best. But when it was really just us, I suddenly felt worried. Without a doubt, when we stood on stage back then, it hit me, that... ...Mari-chan, Kanan-chan and Dia-chan are no longer here. What is the new Aqours? It is really Aqours without the three of them? What do you want to do... ...moving forward? At this rate, Uranohoshi and School Idols will always be misunderstood. But, failure is... ...meant to be recovered from, isn't it? I think there is still time. Can we make it on time? Yes! This time, we have to do it properly for sure, and prove it to those against us. A live show? Our answer is... ...something that we can't find by not moving forward. Despite your worries, let's do the Love Live! show! This isn't like you, Riko-chan. We've been together for a year. I think I may have been influenced by someone. Who is it? I think it's Chika-chan. I think... ...we certainly have a lot more work to do. We have already won. But... We're still not perfect, you know. Really? Are we still not perfect? You look so happy. Right back at you. - Yes. I think this is more like us. Still, there is a lot more we have to do, right? Let's run! Okay! It's too bright, zura... We're going to run another round! What?! One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four. So, where are we going to practice? I checked out many places, but couldn't find one. We need to practice here for the time being. Here? I feel as if we have gone back to the beginning. - The beginning? - Zura? We had no place to practice, there were no club room... ...and we were coming up with the group's name. Stuff like that. When talking with You-chan and Riko-chan we practiced here, didn't we? Then we found it, right? Aqours. Yes. Long time no see. Leah-chan! Saint Snow, zura! Why are you both here? When I emailed them, they mentioned they were in Tokyo... ...and I wanted them to watch our practice. Seriously, my sister is on her graduation trip. Please stop calling us all the time. Sorry. No problem. Leah really wanted to come, you know. Sister! So, I know this is kind of abrupt but could you watch us? How we are performing right now? Yes. I see. How was it? I'll be frank. And I believe that is why you asked us to come here. Yes... Let's say you win Love Live! with a performance score of 100, right now... ...your score is just 30. Actually, make that 20. So low?! Not even half of the full mark? Was the presence of the three third years who left so significant? Kanan Matsuura's feel of the rhythm and dance. Mari Ohara's singing ability. Dia Kurosawa's brilliance and stage presence. Were those... ...what gave Aqours its spark and vigour? Without them, I think you became anxious and lost your composure. It's as if... ...you are restless and not confident. I think you pointed out our flaws precisely. But, what should we do? This is not something you can solve by asking others! You have to figure it out on your own! Leah-chan... Our sisters won't be here anymore! I'm sorry. Is Leah-chan... ...starting new School Idol group? I think that's what she wants to do, but... After saying "Let's start a new one together", she gathered a few people, but... ...apparently it's not going too well. "Practice? That much?" "Yep. For Love Live!" II()II "Will you be able to come tomorrow?" "Sorry" "Let me think about it." You're annoying! I'm sorry. You're trying so hard on your own, Leah-chan. Love Live! is not a game! W-What's that? I've seen that before somewhere, for sure. It's Mari-chan! Zura?! It's not Mari-chan? Thank you for always looking out for my daughter. I am Mari Ohara's mama. Mari's mother! You can't contact them? That's right! Before that, I heard a lot about all of you from Mari. About the school, I really wanted to thank you. Even Ruby-Chan? Ruby felt that since this is a once in a lifetime graduation trip, I decided not to contact anyone. Together with "Hug" and "Death Wa", I can't contact the three of them at all! Who are "Hug" and "Death Wa"? Unless I am mistaken, she's referring to Kanan-chan and Dia-chan. I believe that all of you will be able to find Mari and the others, for sure! Money? No way. If we find the three of them, you'll give us this money? This is chocolate, zura. Yes. It is a performance to show that I will pay for your transport. Of course. But... if you find them for real, I have a gift equivalent of this. So, please do your best. Leave it to us! If you rely on the eyes... ...of this fallen angel Yohane, finding the three of them will be a piece of cake! Are your eyes blinded by money, zura? What do you mean?! Obviously, it will be used for our next live show! Live show! Are we going to do a live show?! But we don't know where they are. I am also worried about them. What do you want to do? I think you should go. This thought occurred to me while watching your practice earlier. Whatever the reason, I think you need to talk to the three graduates. But... In order to take the first step in a new direction, it may not be a bad thing to reflect on what you've done. Chika-chan. I think Sarah-san is right. We can practice for the live shows wherever we are. That's what we have been doing all along, anyway. Don't worry. We can do it! Okay! Let's go! Very, very... ...thank you! So, where did the three of them go... ...for their graduation trip? A practice ground to the North... ...or the land of the mystery South? That is... That is... The three of them traveled to... ...a place where our Ohara ancestors lived. In other words... Could it be... Right here! "Italy" -...eyes! Onto a foreign land, Yohane... Descends! We're here! That's Pistacchio Buono, zura. That was fast! There's also chocolate, zura. Would you like some, Yoshiko-chan? Of course! But I remember having a bad experience after that. But I still want to eat! So, did they contact you? No word from my sis. And nothing from Kanan-chan nor Mari-chan. I only have this they sent me from the first place they arrived at. So, we ought to head to the place in this picture first, right? This is really close by! Do you know this place? Yes! Tsuki-chan lived in Italy when she was young. She's very familiar with this place. I'll be your tour guide. Ask me anything you're not sure about. Now, let's aye aye! Hey! That's my line! This is amazing. There are rivers wherever we go! That's because there are canals all across the town. On the other hand, cars can't pass through. Really? I feel like I'm lost in the city. Here we are. Hanamaru-chan! There, there. That's right. This is the place for sure. The phone's ringing, isn't it? Tsuki-chan. Bovolo. What? It said "Contarini del Bovolo". No matter how I look at it, something feels off. Is that a senate? Whatever, we're going, zura. - Over here? - Probably. What is this?! Amazing! I feel as if I traveled back in time to the Middle Ages! It is supposed to be at the top of this building, but... Sis! Mari-chan! Kanan-chan! What a relief. Sis! Sis! You actually came all this way. To this faraway place. I'm so relieved. The three of you were together, right? Of course. We were always together. Why did you go missing? Go... Missing? I knew it would turn out this way! What did Mari's mother say to Chika and the rest of you? Nothing much. Just that you went missing and that she's worried. Then who is that? Pleasure to meet you. I am Tsuki Watanabe. You-chan's cousin. Nice to meet you! Very pretty. - She's indeed... - You-chan's cousin. Those stairs... I'm seeing stars, zura. Hanamaru-chan! Good work. But Chika, why didn't you or the others hear anything? It means we were being used as bait. Bait? If we had known that Chika-chi and the rest were coming, we would definitely have made contact. So, she made a decoy? A trap to lure us out! What? So, what she said about you going missing was a lie? We can't stay here for long. You. Sorry about this! Uniform! You can't! You can't, zura. - She is indeed... - You-chan's cousin. Stop! I'm sorry. I can't tell you any details right now! Perhaps Mari-chan and the others are running from her mother, zura. Sis. Let's give chase! That's impossible. We don't even know where they're headed. But... What's this? When Yohane looks upon the land that she protects, the fairies will lead the way. Yohane? Not you. I think it means there is a saint named Yohane protecting a place. Is {here such & place? There is. The land of Yohane, protected by Saint Giovanni. Let's gather together there. Do you really intend to run like this? You don't like it? I didn't say that I hate it. I like it. It's like back when we brought Mari out to play when we were small. You certainly don't look like a lady, Mari-san. Let's go! That's... ...not a bad idea either. We've arrived! This place is wonderful, isn't it? Is this another vacation house owned by the Ohara family? You are wealthy indeed. I'd like to agree! But the truth is, I borrowed it from a friend here. Perhaps the vacation home owned by the Ohara family near here, is right now... ...facing a situation like this. Those kids! Did you deliberately meet with Chika and the others... ...to tell them where we were? Yes. By doing so, they will mistake us as running away... ...and look for us at the Ohara vacation home in a different town. You want to buy time, don't you? What do you want to do about Chika and the others? Perhaps if they really understood the message, I think they will realise in time. But... ...they actually came all this way, when Mari's mother asked them to. They ought to forget us, and start a new Aqours like I told them to. They're most likely here not because they were asked to come. Maybe... ...they really have something to say to us. - We've arrived at Florence. - Yohane... Yohane... Yohane... Yohane... - Yohane... Yohane... Yohane... Yohane... Agreed! - Molto Buono, zura! - What did you say? That means it tastes really good! We got the message and came all the way here. Where have Mari-chan and the others gone? Maybe they will contact us if we wait. I wonder if they're here. Any news on your mobile? Nothing. I guess... ...if they used their mobiles, Mari-chan's mother would get an alert. That's right. Here, sorry to keep you waiting. - What's this? - It's huge! This is Bistecca alla Fiorentina. It's a popular dish here. Thank you for the food! Yoshiko-chan, you should try it. Where's Yoshiko-chan? Yoshiko-chan? Yohane-chan! She's gone? That fallen angel... Now she's the one missing. What should we do? Any idea where she could be? If there's any place... Yohane. Yoshiko-chan couldn't stop talking about Yohane! I can't believe it. Every single time... It's huge! What's this? It's amazing! It's Duomo. Dooomo? It's the most famous building in this city. Amazing, isn't it? Having such a huge building in the city itself is unbelievable. Never mind that. Where is that fallen angel? She's not here. Are you looking for someone? Yes, we are. She's about Ruby's age. She's about the same height too. She's always noisy. She's a self-professed fallen angel that is hard to understand, zura. I understand. A noble person like that... Yoshiko-chan! What are you doing, zura? I am not Yoshiko. I am Yohane. We were really worried about you. So, why are you dressed like that? You might get arrested. Do calm down. Ordinary Lili. I am more than calm. Hey, didn't we agree not to call me Lili?! Right now, I am not... ...the fallen angel Yohane. In this place, from Yohane's Saint... I received an angel's birth! The girls in Aqours sure have varying personalities. I regret worrying about her. Now, everyone. Let us follow this angel, Yohane... ...and aim for heaven over there! Heaven? That's the cupola. It's Duomo's canopy. Just for now, for the last time for today, I have time to guide you. Now. Please pay me fifteen Euro per person. Are you asking for money? Those are just normal tickets! You're no angel, zura. Kiran! It's red roofs everywhere! We can't see this in Japan, can we? What a uniform town. Yes. It remained this way for several centuries. The stairs here are too high, zura... Because this is an old building, there's no elevator. The air is full of it. The spirits of Yohane are sending... ...whispers of blessings and gospels! What's that? Fairies winking! What is it? It looks like a signal. When I think about it, the path of fairies... That light... Sis! Are they really here? Yep. Good evening! Welcome. You weren't followed this time? Don't worry. We changed our route several times and hiked up here. Sis! Even so, the fact that you guys came all this way... Did my mother get in touch? No, nothing special whatsoever. Actually, what happened... ...with your mother? Yes. Just something... We came all the way here. Tell us, Mari-chan. I'm going to feel really bad for Chika and the others... ...if you continue hiding it like this. But... The truth is, Mari is getting married. - Did you say "fight"? - That's a battle. - The love of cleanliness? - That's obsession. An exciting story? That's a masterpiece. I'm dying to know the end, zura. That's the conclusion. Could it be boundaries? I said it was marriage. M-Marriage? Since when?! Who are you marrying?! Who?! Who?! Who?! Wait. I'm not getting married. What? Kanan! Quit fooling around. But if you let things continue like this, it's only a matter of time. Aren't we doing this to prevent that from happening? I don't understand anymore. What do you mean? In other words, there has been an offer of marriage. And she has never met the other party even once. Why? Because she wants to take away Mari's freedom. Since a long time ago, Mari's mother didn't like us very much. Mari was always obedient to her mother. But after getting to know us, she started doing as she pleased. She returned to Uranohoshi on her own during high school, and even took up the position of chairwoman. And regarding being School Idols, she didn't have a good impression of it. Even so... So, this graduation trip is... Yes. I wanted Mama to understand and wrote her a letter. That I'm no longer the same girl as before. And if she doesn't allow me freedom, I won't go home. This is a planned rebellion, isn't it? We didn't think she would seriously pursue us all this way. Let's stop fighting, everyone. Calm your hearts. What are you doing, zura? This is the Wish... ...of Angel Yohane. Yoshiko-chan! Are you okay? - What a relief. - Now you really are a fallen angel. What's with the witty jokes? Help me! Finally, she's back to her normal self, zura. The fallen angel calls! But... if this is her normal self, then something was wrong from the beginning. Please shut up, little demon Lili! You're not supposed to call me Lili! Anyway, we've involved Chika and the others into our next step. We need a proper plan. Indeed. M-Mama? Hiding out in a place like this... Was it another of "Hug's" ideas? No, it wasn't! It was my idea. Because you were being difficult, Mama. Because I wasn't difficult, you turned out this way. At the time you ran away from home during elementary school... ...and to save your school, ...you quit high school here to return to Uranohoshi. I put up with it because Papa asked me to. But this is the result! What do you mean by "this"? Don't you know? Nothing good came out of this, did it? The school will be closed, and you, Mari, will not receive your certificate of graduation from abroad. Wait. But I did everything as a School Idol. I won Love Live! together with everyone. So? What advantage was there... ...in becoming a School Idol? Worthless. Worthless? She's that sort of person. That is why we brought Mari to the outside world. Shut up! Whatever Mari does is up to me to-- It's not worthless! Mari? School Idols... ...are not worthless! If I can prove that School Idols are not worthless... ...and capable of great things, please let me do as I wish. If I can show you... ...that School Idols are able to touch the hearts of others, would you acknowledge me, Mama? Would you stop the marriage offer, and let her meet with us when she likes? Fine. Mama. But... If you fail, you will do as I say. "We are closed." Leah? I just got a message from Chika and the others. They will be doing a live performance there, and... "I really understand what Leah-chan's feeling for School ldol." "Yep." "But actually I don't think that way." "I see." "The level is so high that even if I try with you guys, I would just get in the way." "So maybe it's better I quit." Sister, please... ...turn off the lights. Leah. Buongiorno! "Good evening" is "Buonasera". Ottimo, zura. Seriously, what's up with you? You ate so much but haven't changed a bit. Are you really human? This lasagne is delicious too, zura. Delicious! So, has it been decided? What has? The place for us to sing. That was fun, wasn't it? Fontana Di Trevi and Bocca della Verita. Indeed! It's very exciting when we're together. What are you talking about? You were the one who brought it up. You wanted to do a live performance here, to show your mother how great School Idols are! I know that already! The truth is, everywhere is beautiful. Crowds would gather. I think the effect would be best if we sing on stage, though. That's right. The fountain was also beautiful. And so were the stairs. It makes you want to use them all, doesn't it? I don't think we can do that. Then how about the Colosseum? Leave the video taking to me! Good idea! Indeed. We will be able to gather a huge crowd there. So, it's decided then. Right? I have something I want everyone to listen to, zura. We first year's also wish to discuss this. Could you let us decide on the live performance venue this time? Up till now, we relied completely on Chika-chan and Sis and the others. That's why... I want you to trust us with this live performance! My stomach is... ...dangerously full! Please do something so that you make it to the stage. Good night, zura. Why does this always happen to me?! I'm sorry. This happened because Mari suddenly said something like that. Well, one thing led to the other. - To give one tit for tat? - Maybe. If you're not for the idea, the three of us can come up with something ourselves. Chika, you and the others can-- It's fine. On the contrary, we're also happy. Really? Yes. The truth is... ...we came not just because Mari-chan's mother asked us to. Actually, everyone including us, Ruby-chan and the others were feeling worried. We're all a little unsettled. What is the new Aqours? The new Aqours? We knew that we needed to figure it out by ourselves, but we couldn't. And then, Sarah-san suggested meeting up with you and talking about it. I see. Kanan-chan, what do you think? I agree with what you said, Chika. That you need to find it yourselves. That's right. There will be no meaning if you take our opinion. I guess so. But... But our feelings will always be here. Mari's, Dia's... ...and mine too. They won't change and will always be here. Always? Yes. Always. Right! We have an early start tomorrow, so let's go to bed. Good night. Chika-chan. I saw it for a moment. I feel like I can see it! So, where will we perform, zura? Through these Yohane's eyes... Actually, we've settled on this place! Sis. Ruby can do anything. Anything! Yeah! What made you choose The Spanish Steps? Because... ...it resembles the stone stairs we have at the beach in Numazu, zura! Mari. Mama. The steps that I have taken with everyone up till now... ...are all a part of me, and define who I am. Just like how Mama and Papa have raised me, everyone in Aqours has also raised me. That is why I can't let anything go. This is who I am right now. What was that about? No idea. But... I think she understands. Yohane is back! I'm tired, zura. Wait for me! "Seishin High School" "Uranohoshi Girls' High School branch school" There's no one here, zura. But Mu-chan and the others told us to come here. Welcome home! Sorry to ask you to help us conduct the live performance. No problem at all! When I contacted everyone after getting your message, they all said they would cooperate. Actually, even the stage image is complete! Really? You're in for a surprise! Here it is! Ta-da! Well? It's amazing! But such a splendid stage... It's so splendid, but we didn't have enough time. That's what I said too, but... After everyone had discussed it, we all wanted to build a great stage worthy of Aqours. We also want to prove that Uranohoshi is competent. But what about the sound personnel for the live performance, we're short on manpower. Hello. Nice to meet you! They came and spoke with me. Some parents are still opposed to this, but... ...they said that they wish to cooperate. It's still not enough, though. You truly are the student representative! Thank you. Could you be... - Yohane-chan? - You're mistaken! I went to the same middle school as you! I always watched you online. The advent of Yohane! We just got them to support us. It would look bad if you ran off. You're so annoying! Want to take pictures together, Yohane-chan? W-What's this about? For real? - We want to take pictures! Wait! We won't let you escape. Do your best, zura. H-How mean! I've been betrayed by little demons! Thank you! I'll treasure this. Don't worry about it. Give me your ID, so that I can send you pictures. Shake shake (Transferring contact info) Thanks! Let's work together. All right, let's do this! But it will be different from the last time we sang there. Mari-chan and the others aren't here, zura. We can do it. We can do it! Ruby-chan. I can do it too. And Chika-chan too? Yes. We need to work hard, too. Speaking of that, where are our souvenirs? Oh, I forgot. What?! But still, I never imagined the new school to be like that. They should have told us in detail. If I had known the situation, I could have helped. That is... It's something that they need to solve on their own, right? What's wrong? This is so boring! Because we can't do anything. It can't be helped, can it? We've graduated, after all. Chika and the others said they want us to watch their live performance. I know that. This is... Here, you should play well with each other. Please be quiet for a while. Because Chika-chan needs to concentrate. Sit. Sit. Sit! Be obedient for once! Everything seems to be going well. Sorry. Somehow, I feel like... ...I understand how we should start. Do you mean Aqours with six members? I always thought of starting as something you do from zero. We start from zero, and that is why it is called a start. Is that wrong? It's wrong. Because if we were to start from zero, all our experiences to date would be insignificant, right? And that's not the case at all. Everything I've done before still remains. Not a single thing has disappeared. "The note for lyrics" "VOL.8.0" "No peeking!!" "if you peek the orange will..." I'm looking forward to your lyrics. Please compose a good song. Of course. Everyday, I'm learning how to compose songs. When over there, I listened to music whenever I had time. I see. We're not the only ones working hard. Ruby-chan and Hanamaru-chan... ...went to the textiles shop to make reference for our outfits. Also, You-chan and Yoshiko-chan were working hard at new dance choreography. Really? Aqours really is amazing. It's great, isn't it? Being the leader of such a group. It's great! Chika-chan! What is it? Kanan-chan's on the phone. What? My battery is flat. Leah-chan wants to join Aqours? In other words, she wants to transfer schools? Yes. If the application is processed in spring, she will make it in time to attend school with all of you. And you are all familiar with her. Did Leah-chan herself say that is what she wants? No. They haven't spoken yet. But Sarah believes that is the best way. She called to ask our opinion as a fellow graduate. I think it's one thing to talk to Sarah, but how Chika and the others feel is also important. So, Leah-chan... Wants to join Aqours. Just thinking of it... You call that a step? Being a School Idol is not a game, Yoshiko! I'm not Yoshiko, I'm Yohane! What were you imagining, zura? What do you think? I don't mind the idea at all. I mean, we talked about this. Aqours doesn't depend on how many members we have. Also, Leah-chan is our friend who competed in Love Live! like we did. It sounds fine, doesn't it? But somehow I feel this will cause trouble. She could contribute a lot more than Yoshiko-chan, zura. It's just that... I'm against it. I think that this is definitely not what Leah-chan wants. I don't think her problems can be solved even if she joins Aqours. Why do you feel that way? Because after Saint Snow dissolved, Leah-chan started a new group. She wanted to preserve the memory of Saint Snow that she did with her sis... that's why she started a new group. For that reason, I don't think she wants to join Aqours. Ruby. I sang together with my sis before, so I know the feeling. My sis and the others are not gone. Even if we are not standing on the same stage, we are together. Together? I guess Leah-chan just hasn't realised yet... ...that she needs to do something to fill the void of Sarah-san not being there. She tried to do all she could to replicate Saint Snow. Because she didn't win Love Live! with her sis, she is bent on winning it... ...because she feels guilty towards Sarah-san. I think perhaps you are the one who truly understands how Leah feels, Ruby. Your sister also graduated, so you have a lot in common. I agree with Ruby-Chan, zura. Same here. Yes! If so, what should we do? That's right. I think the best way is to just tell her. Right. We're with you. And we will always be with you. Let's make Leah's biggest dream come true. Dream. That's it. Dream! I think everyone has the same idea. The dream that Leah-chan couldn't achieve, no matter what she did. That's right. Let's make it come true. Together! We need to tell Sarah-san right away. "School ldol" "Do you want to start?" "School ldol" "Do you want to start?" "Sorry" "You want to quit?" "...Yeah. I don't think I can do it after all..." "I see. Thank you for everything." "Everything will be alright. I'll be cheering for you." It was our biggest dream. And I ruined it. Sister. Sister! To think that Saint Snow lost... They were supposed to win. I don't know what happened. Leah! Sister. Why are you dressed like that? Now, we will conduct the final round of Love Live! Let me introduce the two groups in the finals. Amazing. - She's in such high spirits. - We might lose. First up, starting afresh from Uranohoshi. This may be their first appearance, but they are second to none! School Idols, Aqours! And the other group is... ...a superstar born in the North. Saint Snow! We are going to hold a Love Live! competition just for us. If we are going to be on stage for the finals, we need to decide on our outfits and dance steps. Sister. If we're going to compete against Aqours... ...and if you manage to be on stage, I have something to say to you. Sister! This is not the time to cry. Let's move forward together, Leah-chan! You can't always be pampered. Since meeting you, Hanamaru-chan and Yoshiko-chan, I have been trying hard. Love Live! isn't a game! Let's sing. Yes. Both of us, on stage... ...with all we've got against Aqours! This moment right now will never vanish. Saint Snow and... ...the bond between us... ...will always remain. It will always remain in your heart, Leah. No matter how we change, it will always remain. That is why you don't have to chase it. This is what I want to say. Sister. I've always thought that being a School Idol was fun! But this will be our last time. So, let us show them for the last time. Our spirit! Amazing! School Idols really are amazing! The fact that we are the only ones watching this Love Live!... ...is such a waste! Chika-chan? I've got it! About our new Aqours! "11 days" "Zura!!" "Sent from Mari Stewshine" "8 days to descend" "Giran!" "6 days" "Aye aye! !" "5 days to go" "3 clays until everyone shines!" "Just a little more" "Just a little more" Come to think of it, it is our first time creating the Aqours stage... ...entirely from scratch. That's right. It's symbolic of our new beginning. We'll be done right after this! Mu-chan, you guys look like you're having fun too! Yes. The last time we built something together was at school closing festival. Now is the time to show off what us girls from Uranohoshi can do! This is the stage we will be singing on, right? I can't wait. I'm not nervous, zura. Indeed. But Why? Maybe it's because we have all grown a little. - Maru and everyone! - Right. Chika, you guys go on home first. Leave the rest to us. Have a good rest and show us a great performance! But... Don't worry. We have plenty of help. Right? The time has come. It looks like I can't avoid this after all. Stay calm, zura. Tsuki-chan, what's going on? After watching the live video, everyone gathered. We felt we could also do something. But... Aren't you against us? We realised something. Why do we even have club activities? Even our parents realised. For what reason? To have fun. You truly enjoyed yourselves being School Idols in earnest. We ought to learn from your example. That is what Aqours... ...and Saint Snow made us realise. Thank you. That's right. We asked to do this too. So, don't worry. Let us all help. What do you say? I see. Then we'll leave it to you! What do you want to do? Shall we practice a little? I think we could, but... I don't know. Speaking of that, how long will Mari-chan and the others be here for, zura? Once we have seen you guys make a start, we'll leave. To our respective places. Chad.! Sis. As expected, after all. So, before that... Want to go somewhere together? The nine of us. Come to think of it, the bus stop is no longer here. When the school is gone, there will be no need for it. Unless you walk fast, it gets dark really quickly. "Stop" "Push the button for the next stop." "Notice of Closure" This place feels so nostalgic. "Notice of Closure" It seems like only yesterday that we graduated. We took this path everyday. I guess we missed it even not coming for a while. Honestly, so much happened here, didn't it? It was busy everyday. Rather than busy, it was noisy. You're one to talk, Yoshiko-chan, zura. What? Zuramaru and everyone made so much noise too! But it was fun. "Ura High" No idea. Maybe the school was calling out to me. But I'm relieved it's still here, zura. It's open. Don't worry. It won't disappear. Neither Uranohoshi, nor this school. The playground, library, roof, club room, sea and sandy beach. Also, the bus stop, sun, ships and sky, mountains and the town. And Aqours, too. Let's go home. Absolutely everything is here. It'll all stay here. It won't become zero, for sure. It will remain in us, become a part of us, and always walk with us along our journey! All of it is a part of us. That is why, we always begin from zero. We start, and move one step at a time. Until it piles up. But... ...the moment you realise it, you move back to zero. Even so, we would have accomplished things one by one. Everything will work out. I definitely believe that it will! Then again, reality is harsh. My biggest dream did not come true. I feel as if I went back to zero, but... within us, so many treasures have been born. These things... ...won't disappear, that's for sure! The blue bird... ...has flown over the rainbow. We... ...can definitely do it! "Today's the day!" Everyone! Hello! "Due to an event" "No car entry" - This is the Aqours live show! - we are the Uranohoshi... - This is the Aqours live show! - We are the Uranohoshi... No, ex-Uranohoshi School Idols, Aqours! Shortly, we will be performing live on stage at the South Exit. Please come and watch... ...our newly formed Aqours! Please give us your support! All right, let's sing our best. For everyone's sake! With all our strength! Let's bring it to them. This song. Our first song! One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine! Did you hear that? From start to the end, together with everyone, ...to the future beyond! Aqours! Sunshine! Hurry up! Wait a second. We're here! We always went swimming in the sea when we were little. Anyway, why did we come here? This is our sacred ground. Sacred ground. Sacred ground? What? Didn't you see us live in Numazu? .. ...will definitely be in the School Idol Club when I enter high school! It's starting again. Everyone looks really sparkly. I want to shine, too. It can't be helped. So, what name should we use? Right. The name will be... Aqours... Sunshine!
