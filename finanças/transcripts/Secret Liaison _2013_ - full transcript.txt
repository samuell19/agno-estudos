Hello? You almost gave me a heart atta... Hey, Rodge. Okay, give me the news. Did they agree to settle? You've got to be kidding me! There are over a hundred plaintiffs. Do they realize that I am the only one standing between their CEO and a criminal trial? You know, if we were on the other side of this, we would have crushed 'em by now. Small latte, please? Mm hmm Yep Hey, hey, hang on one second, I'm gettin' a call. Hey... Brad... Been a while... What? No! No, don't let her say a word to anybody until I get there. Yeah, no I'm on my way. Rodge, I lied, you're going to have to finish this one up on your own. No, I gotta get to Seattle. Something's come up with my sister. Yeah Alright, well um... send her over. Okay Hi Hey So, you made detective? Yeah, I did. Long time, no see. Thanks for calling me. Don't mention it. I mean, what kinda guy would I be if I just left someone I cared about in the lurch, right? Okay, I'm trying to be nice... I know, so am I. She doesn't even know I called you. This was your idea? The arraignment's at five. At five? That gives me a couple of hours with absolutely no prep time and a client who, my own sister, who doesn't even want me here? Sam... she's scared. Alright... Do you have anything you can tell me so I don't go in there looking like a complete amateur? It's all right there. DA's got motive, Bren's DNA is all over the victim's car. Lotta angry text messages flying back and forth earlier that night. Looks like an affair that ended badly. Trevor Smith? Trevor Smith, 34, one of those techie guys. Worked for IDG. Some kind of industrial facility doing IT. Had a wife, six-month-old son. Lived in Bryant. Alright, what about a murder weapon? Her car. Where is it now? Never found it. She reported it stolen the next morning. Well, that's not good. No, it's not. She doesn't have an alibi, either. This just keeps getting better. Ah... so what do you think? You don't wanna know what I think, Sam. Thanks. It's good to see you again, Sam. Sam, what are you doing here? Brad called me. Course he did. I looked at the file. You need a lawyer, Bren, and a good one. Don't I have the right to refuse council? Bren. You are about to be charged with first degree murder. There's nothing that you can do. You'd be surprised at what I can do. There's an arraignment in a couple of hours. Just... let me get you through that. If you don't want me here after that, I am on the first flight back to LA and I will find you someone... decent up here. Let me be your lawyer right now. Not your sister. Fine. How did you know the, uh, the victim? Trevor. He was just... a guy. We met at a party. We were... dating. Did you know he was married? I found out at the end. And you saw him the night before he was killed? No, we just texted, that's all. I... I told him that I wanted to end it. And where were you then? I was at home. Alone. What about your car? I woke up, and it was gone, and I... called the police to report it. When did you find out he was dead? Why does it matter? Bren, I can't help you unless I have all of the details. This is serious. Yeah, you think that I don't know that? They are gonna say that you were jilted and killed him in a jealous rage. They have a witness, with a statement, saying that you argued outside of his office two days before he was killed and they have your DNA all over his car and his phone. Oh! And you know what? Here! Pick your favourite incriminating message. The one where you accuse him about lying about his marriage? Or the one where you threaten him... That's out of context! Alright. Alright. Is there anything else you can tell me before we go in there? Like what? Something, anything. Is there someone who might have wanted to hurt him? Something to create reasonable doubt? Not that I know of. Okay. I'm gonna do everything I can, Bren, I promise. Hey. Okay. Thanks for not asking. Asking what? If I did it. Is the defendant ready to enter a plea? Yes, your honour. How do you plead? Not guilty, your honour. Alright, thank you. Looks like we'll be going to trial then. The state considers Miss Simms, the defendant, to be a flight risk... ..and due to the nature of the crime, we ask that the accused be held without bail until the trial. You can't be serious. My client has no prior criminal record, nor any liquid assets of any note. Your client possesses a property valued at over $800,000. Do your research, counsellor? Alright, alright, that's enough. Bail is set at one million. Court's adjourned. Bailiff? You bought a house? It's not as extravagant as it sounds. Still, you should have told me. When? 'Hi sis, guess what? I've been arrested for murder and, oh yeah, I bought a house'? I'm gonna work on your bail. See you soon. No alibi, DNA evidence in the victim's car, she just happens to have her car stolen the night this guy becomes road kill? The motive's clear as day. She's toast. It's all circumstantial, you don't have the car, and there's nothing even tying her to the scene. We have enough, and you know it. That's why you're here: 'cause we both know it'll take a miracle for her to get out of this. Always a pleasure, Richard. Duty calls. Hi, yeah, whaddya got? Hey Hey! What... what are you doing here? He's a cocky little fella, huh? Ugh. Do you know he was still waiting to take the bar when I left? Hmm Look, Sam, I did some asking around. You do realize I'm representing the accused, right? Yeah. You're welcome, by the way. Sorry. Look. Way my guy tells it, it's open and shut. I hope you didn't come all the way down here just to tell me that, you coulda called to tell me it was hopeless. You didn't let me finish. There's at least one lead that didn't get followed up on. Mr. Fix Computers? Trevor had some dealings with this guy. Didn't seem relevant at the time but, you never know, a lead's a lead. What optimistic piece of work told you that? I don't know, and ex-girlfriend of mine? Sounds a little naive. Yeah. Well, she wasn't so bad. Thanks for the tip. If we're gonna get through this, you're gonna have to give me all of the details. Even the tiny ones. Not that this house is tiny, mind you. How did you afford this? Well, most of the money came from selling mom's place, that's how I paid off the mortgage. Plus, the market was crap. Wait, you sold the house? Well you... nevermind. I'm going to get a drink, do you want anything? Sure, I'll take whatever you're having. Let me just uh... make yourself at home. What did you say you do, again? I'm in corporate event planning, you know, parties, conventions... Must be good money. Ah, it pays the bills. Do you still paint? No, not really. It was kinda hard after mom passed away. I remember this one. how was she in the end? She missed you. I'm sorry I wasn't there. Hey, at least you made the funeral. I'm surprised she even remembered me in the end. She was still so proud of you. Do you want something to eat? I'm... I'm gonna get us something to eat. No, really, thanks for the hospitality, but I think we should be focussing on your case. You know, take a look at those text messages? Can't we just talk... for a bit? One sec. Do you need a hand? Ah, nope. I'm sure you have all sorts of stories about LA boy toys, wining and dining you... Shh... Shoot. Yeah, you have no idea. Come on, you must have had a couple of juicy flings since Brad. Give me all the... What the hell are you doing? I... I just... You're just, just what? Searching through my phone? I'm just looking out for you. Isn't that illegal? Bren, I'm your sister. I thought that... Oh, now, now you're my sister? See I thought you were supposed to be my lawyer. You're right. I'm sorry. And I thought things were gonna be different. What's that supposed to mean? You being here, Sam, isn't going to help. I tried to tell you that at the station. Tell me what? To leave? Maybe I did it. No! No, I am going to help you beat this. I am not gonna lose my sister. Five years away, Sam, and now you don't want to lose me? That is unbelievable. I dropped everything and I came up here to help you. What do you think you're gonna do? You're just gonna wave this magic wand and it's all gonna go away? What is going on with you? Why are you so quick to just give up? There is something else going on here, something you're not telling me, and right now it seems like I care a hell of a lot more about this than you do. No, I care. I care. Do you? Do you really? Okay then tell me something. Tell me something that's gonna help me here. I can't! You can't, or you won't? I need you to go. What? Now. Please leave. Fine. I'm not letting you back in until you apologize, Sam. Alright. We got off on the wrong foot, we're both stressed, we're gonna get through this together. Sam? Please, you don't need to do this! I won't say anything, please! Please, I don't know where it is, just leave me alone! Bren, pick up. We can't leave things like this. I've turned around, I'll be at your house in a sec. Bren? Brenda? BRENDA! Brenda? Brenda? Are you in here? Brenda, it's me, open up! You're okay, you're okay. They're gone. It's okay. It's okay. It was dark... Maybe it was a black SUV. You didn't get the license plate? Nah, that would have made it too easy. It's ok, I've got enough to get 'em started downtown. I'm gonna keep an officer on the house at night for the next few days. I'm gonna stay here tonight. No, really, you don't... you don't have to. It's alright, I don't mind, really. Okay. Alright, I'm gonna go check on Brenda. Alright. Hey Sam, I'm just gonna be outside then, if you need anything. Thanks. You know, whoever did this, I think they're trying to send a message. I don't know, shut Brenda up, scare her... but they made a mistake. How's that? 'Cause now there's something out there that somebody doesn't want me to find. Alright, see you in the morning. Yeah, goodnight. Bren? You awake? 'Morning! Oh hey, I... made breakfast. Ugh, I wish I could but I've gotta start interviewing people. I think if we're gonna have a chance at this, our best shot is to follow Trevor, find out who he was mixed up with. What good will that do? Well, we know he wasurdered... And a point for Captain Obvious. ...Which means, somebody else besides you had motive. So... what should I do? Um, nothing. You stay here. Stay out of trouble. I will be back in a few hours, okay? Computer security, on the side I freelance for big companies. Shipping, computer tech, stuff like that. What'd you do for Trevor Smith? Cheap jerk. Yeah. He hired me to install this... kind of remote control monitoring program on his computer. What kind of monitoring program? Look. I'd love to tell you, I really would, but my clients expect a certain level of confidentiality, you know? It's a legal thing. You understand, right? You tell me about the program, and I'll forget to mention that this place is in violation of, oh, about 15 different state laws. I'm a lawyer. Jeez. Kidding. The program is called Desk Troll. Basically, it gives you complete access to your computer from anywhere. You log in remotely, you control everything. Applications, documents, you name it. A lot of these programming guys like to work from home. Are you gonna see Trevor soon? 'Cause he's about 50 days past due. This one came in undelivered last week. Mr. Prope, were you aware that Trevor was murdered? Guess I'm not getting paid then. Hello? Mrs. Smith? Hi, this is Samantha Simms, I'm Brenda Simms' attorney? Yes, I was wondering if I could have a few minutes of your time. Sorry about that. It's Michael's nap time. Of course. Thank you for seeing me, I know this must be a really hard time for you. It says in my file that you were, you were out of town when Trevor was murdered? Yeah, I was with Michael in New York. Um, so I... I couldn't... Oh, no, I didn't mean to... It's ok. So you wanted to know about Trevor, right? Mmhmm... Honestly, he wasn't much of a husband. He was always working or out doing who knows what. I rarely even saw him. Oh, so... he never worked from home? He hated it, especially with the baby. Huh. Uh... did you... did you know that he was... Did I know he was cheating? I wish I could say that I was surprised, but uh... I wasn't. Even when he was here, he wasn't really here. You know what I mean? Um... He worked someplace, uh... somewhere called IDG? He took a job doing IT support for IDG Industries. Wasn't what he wanted to be doing, but... we needed the money. Do you have any idea what he was working on when he died? Mostly on Mark Carey's website. Mark Carey? He's that politician... Oh, okay. ...I'll be honest, your sister would probably know more than I do. She was the one he was spending most of his time with. Not me. If you can think of anything else that might help, if you could call me... Sure... ...that's my cue. I'm sorry, do you think you could let yourself out? Of course. Thanks again. Beaumont, huh? Hi, excuse me, I'm here to see Mark Carey? Do you have an appointment? Well... The Senator's a very busy man, lady. You need to have an appointment. I'll just be with you in a minute. I'm sorry, Rhonda. Sorry, you would like to speak to... No. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just heading in for a quick interview with Carey now. Yeah. We'll see what happens. Oooh, oh I'm so sorry! Sorry, excuse me, I am so sorry! You're here to see Senator Carey, aren't you? I am, is he ready for me? And please don't tell me he's in another meeting. I am so sorry, he's on a call, but he'll only be a half an hour. And there's a coffee shop right across the street? Yeah, it's Seattle. There's always a coffee shop across the street. Well, he appreciates your patience. Whatever. Half an hour. Thanks. You betcha! Not only to speak for your principles, but to act on them as well. No matter what the cost. Your two o'clock is here, Marylin Steele from Channel Three News. Thank you. Hi Senator, I'm... Not Marylin Steele from Channel Three. No, I'm not. And I'm assuming that she does not know that you have her credentials. No, she doesn't. But, when she returns from the coffee shop across the street, I will be happy to personally apologize. Well, I'm happy to hear that. So I assume you have a fascinating reason for being here so that I won't throw you out. My name is Samantha Simms. I am representing Brenda Simms in the murder of Trevor Smith. Yeah. I heard about that. That's terrible. Um, please. Thank you. So, you knew him? Yeah. Yeah, um, not really well, he helped design our website but I have a lot of highly intelligent young people that work for me now. Well, really I'm just trying to re-trace his final days, find out who he might have had dealings with. You know, you'd be much better off speaking with my campaign manager who had a lot more interaction with him. Between my official business and campaigning, I don't have a lot to do with the day to day around here. How about socially? Well, my schedule's pretty packed, so I don't have a lot of... So you never went to a place called the Beaumont with Trevor? Like I said, you're more than welcome to speak with my campaign manager. Great. And what is his name? Mark, have you seen the report... Alice Walters, my wife. Ah, nice to meet you. You as well! I thought you were meeting with Marylin? Um, Alice, this is Samantha Simms. She's representing Brenda Simms in the Trevor Smith case. I told her that you would... be someone to talk with in regards to Trevor seeing as that you knew him better than I. Of course. Don't forget to review the new campaign commercials that Andrew sent over? Will do. Oh, if you could do me a favour and send an intern across the street to let Miss Steele know that I'm ready for her now. Will do. And for Pete's sake, honey, change the tie. Why don't you come with me? Thank you. And thank you, Senator. So, how well did you know Trevor? Well enough to know that he was a very talented web programmer. Not exactly the most personable member of our staff. Oh really, how so? Well, Trevor could be a little bit over dramatic when it came to his compensation. I mean, you'd ask for the tiniest update or improvement and he'd kinda roll his eyes like he had the weight of the world on him. Hmm, I see. Every time he'd come here, he'd just go right past me, straight in to see Mark. Oh. So how long have you and the Senator been married? Oh, too long... I'm just kidding! No, we make a great team. And by team, I mean I call all the shots. Anyhow, he's a great man. And he'll be an even better one after November. Is there anything else you could tell me to help me out, maybe... uh... Trevor's contacts...? Look, um... I would like to help you, I really would. But this unfortunate business with Trevor has cast an unwelcome spotlight on this office. Now, I don't know what Trevor was involved in or with who. But you have to understand that it's vital to this campaign that my husband not be involved in any way. Right. Right. Um... One last question? Of course. How often did the Senator frequent the Beaumont with Trevor? Who told you about that? You just did. Thank you for your time. I don't know where it is, I know that he... he worked in the offices... Okay, nevermind about that. As soon as we're finished, you're leaving town. No. No, please, if I leave I'm going to look even more... Shut. Up. You did this, now it's time for you to start thinking about the people around you. You got that? Unless you wanna do things the hard way. In which case, be my guest. Okay, okay, I'll go, just... Police!!!! Hey! Let her go! Let her go. Let her go. Move away from her right now. Now! Move away from her. You ok? Get down, get down. Art fan? Not really, I know an artist. Hmm... I've always loved that piece, the subtle brush strokes leading the eye right where the artist wants it. It's very nice. This is an exclusive members only club Ms. Um... Samantha Simms. May I ask how you got in? Your prep cook left the back door open when he went out for a smoke. Did you know that it's illegal to smoke within 25 feet of a public building? How may I help you? One of my clients is being accused of murdering one of your members. Trevor Smith? I'm afraid we don't disclose information regarding the membership. Right. I could get a subpoena for your records, but truthfully, it would save us both a lot of paperwork and a lot of hassle if you just cooperate, Miss...? Kayleigh LeDuc. What would you like to know? Did you know Trevor, Miss LeDuc? He was a new member... When was the last time he was here? About a month ago. Was he with anyone? Usually. Do you have any idea how he might have afforded your exclusive membership? A member's financial situation is not my concern. He paid, that's all I know. Was Trevor ever here with anyone else, other than a woman? For that, you will need a subpoena I'm afraid. I've been working in Los Angeles for the last five years. I know how this works. I don't want to ruin anyone's reputation. All I really wanna know is who Trevor was spending his time with. Okay, ah, the initials 'G.H.' mean anything to you? If I give you a name in good faith, you tread lightly. I'll do my best. Her name is Gina. Trevor met her here. I'm sorry, I need to take this. No. Hello? What? I... I'll be right there. Okay. I'm sorry, something's come up, uh, I have to run. How do I get a hold of this Gina? Here's the number. Tread lightly. Thanks. Oh, excuse me. Miss Simms. Whatever Trevor Smith was involved in got him killed. Perhaps you shouldn't be so eager to put yourself on his path. Duly noted. Oh, and say Hi to Mark Carey for me. Where is she? Bedroom. Bren... Don't even try. Try what? I'm leaving. No, you can't leave. Look, Trevor is dead and it's my fault, I should have never let you help me. How is it your fault? What is going on that you're not telling me? It doesn't matter, we can't win. Bren. If you don't show up to court on Thursday, you will lose this house, you will lose the case, and you will become a fugitive. I know it's daunting, but we have to keep fighting. I am tired of being afraid, Sam. Afraid of who? Who, that guy that Brad saw you with? Bren, this is your life we're talking about, it's not a game. If you lose this case, you will lose everything. If there is anything... anything I need to know... You were the smart one, you ran away, why can't I? I didn't run away. Is that what you told Brad? Leave him out of this. You left. You left him, you left mom and you left me, and you know what? Everybody still looks up to you. You swoop in here and you save the day. But you know what? The rest of us? We don't get a happily ever after, we are stuck with our dying mothers and men who use us and lie to us and friends who would sell us out in a heartbeat. No job, no money, no life. Bren. If you leave, I can't defend you. I'm your sister, why can't you talk to me? It doesn't matter. Just go back to LA, you don't want to be here. That's not true. I don't want you here. You don't mean that. Go talk to your Prince Charming. Stay here. Go. Alright, explain this to me again? Just as I got here, I saw her leaving with this guy. And you'll never guess where they went. Where? IDG Industries. Wait, where Trevor worked? I looked into it afterward, Trevor had an office in the corporate building. I followed them in. This guy was looking for something, Sam, until he spied me. She's afraid of something, I... Look, you don't think... What? I don't know, it's just... things are starting to look a little suspicious. No. No, she is involved somehow, but there is no way that she... Brenda. Brenda? Brenda! Are you kidding me? Come on, Sam, I'll call the cab company, find out where she's going. Let's go. Dammit, Brenda! I owe you one. Okay. What'd they say? Taxi dropped her off at an outlet mall in Tulelip. Well, hopefully she'll come to her senses before it's too late. Why'd she run? What if Brenda and Trevor were up to something together? I mean, maybe he tricked her into... Sam. Did I ever tell you about Ted Pritchard? Who? He was my partner when I first made Detective, tough guy. Didn't have a lot of patience. The guy showed me the ropes, taught me everything I needed to know. One day I find out he's accepting bribes from this pawn shop over on Rainier, it was fancy stolen goods. I couldn't believe it. I didn't understand how someone I thought I knew so well could do something like that. No. No, listen... No. She is not lying about the murder. I... I can't start thinking like that. You need to start looking at the facts here. If I stop believing in her, then who's she got left? Okay. She's covering something up though, and I gotta find out why. That's the million dollar question. Yeah. Good thing you're friends with a detective. So we're friends now? You're one of the good ones, you know that? You want some coffee for the road? I'd love one, thank you. Okay. So how is LA? Sunny. I'm going back, you know. Good, I mean, you should. That sun down there... Yeah, it's nice, beats rain nine months a year. You know the rain's good for you, keeps things alive. Yeah, sometimes too much rain can change a person though. You used to love the rain, Sam. Yeah, well, that was then. I'm different now. Clearly. Mmm, no, I can't, I can't do this right now. I'm sorry. Okay. Just... I can't. Bren, hey, it's me. Um, I can't help you if I don't know where you are. Can you... can you just call me back and let me know that you're ok? Alright, bye. Hello? Hi, uh, this is Samantha Simms. I'm working on the Trevor Smith case? Yeah, I was wondering if I could schedule a time to talk with you. Gina? Hi, Sam? Yes, nice to meet you! Nice to meet you! So, you attended some parties with Trevor? MmHmm, when he needed a date, I was the arm candy. Oh. And when was the last time you saw him? Uh, two nights before he died. He had a fight with Barb, he needed to blow off some steam. Barb? Oh, um, a girl from work. And did he happen to say what the fight was about? Money. It's funny, he acted like a big shot, throwing money around, it was all an act. He was always looking for the next opportunity, the next scheme, keep the cash coming in. Hmm. And do you know where Barb is now? She quit the club pretty soon after. Is there anything else you can tell me about Trevor? Well, conversation wasn't really part of the conversation, if you know what I mean. And you didn't mind that he was married? MmmMmm. As long as he paid me, I didn't care what he did. Wait, what do you mean, paid you? It's... what I do. You didn't know? Hey, hey! You scared the hell out of me! What are you doing here? Sorry about that, a bit jumpy, huh? I just heard your client skipped town. Come to gloat? Actually, the opposite. I came to throw you a bone. You didn't get this from me. Thanks. What do you want me to see? Okay, um, the Beaumont. Gina. His son, Michael. Okay. What the heck were you doing with this guy? He had a fight with Barb... And who's Barb? Oh, a... girl from work. Where are you now, Barbara? Come on, come on, come on. Oh no, no... Hey Bren, it's me, again. Can you please call me when you get this? I'm really worried about you. Bye. What the heck were you into? Oh my god, Brad, are you okay? Woah, woah, Sam, what are you doing? I'm sorry! What are YOU doing? What, are you trying to get yourself killed? I just came by to make sure you're okay, that's all. Oh, I'm so sorry, let me see that. Come on. Here. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. Alright, so talk. I told you. I came by to make sure you're okay. Now I tried to call you, but you weren't answering. Yeah, I was out getting almost killed. What? Sam. What are you doing here, anyway? You love me. What? No, I don't. Yeah, you do. You're delusional. You kissed me the other night, remember? That doesn't... No. And you know what? You kissed me. I missed you, Sam. Brad... I miss kissing you. Don't. I even miss fighting with you. Stop it. I can't do this right now. My sister's being accused of murder, I have to go to court tomorrow and defend her in absentia because I don't know where the hell she is. You don't have to do it alone. Yeah, well, I'm all she's got. Then let me help you. My client, my responsibility. And you know what? I... I should have done more from the beginning... Done more? Done more what? What would you have done? Stayed here? You were right to leave. What? You heard me. I've had five years to think about this and yeah, it's been nice to throw it in your face a little but the truth is you did what was right for you after spending years raising your sister practically on your own. No, I ran. You ran? Come on. You left, so you could make something of yourself. So you could take care of your mom. I... I wasn't even here when she died. I... Bren had to... Bren had to do what she had to do and you did what you had to do. And now you're back. End of story. Thanks. Where were you tonight, exactly? And did it have anything to do with... I went to Trevor's office. You went where? How did you get in? The truth? I broke in. Sam... I didn't take anything! Alright, there were files on his computer, pictures of him and Brenda, and other girls, and I didn't know what else to do. I am out of options, and I always know what to do and I... I don't want to lose my sister... You're not going to lose your sister. Okay. It's gonna be okay. I did miss you. I really did. The Beaumont. Everything okay? That man that I saw last night at... at the office... I saw him at the Beaumont. The Beaumont. Yeah, do you know it? Yeah. That place is bad news, Sam. Why didn't you tell me this? I... I don't know, I... but Trevor was a regular there. And so was Mark Carey. There's this um... Barbara, who was the last person to see Trevor alive. Wait. Who's Barbara? I don't know, but one of the other girls mentioned her and... you know what? When I was in Trevor's office I saw in his ledger there were records of payments made to her. The Beaumont caters to the most exclusive group of self-entitled, not to mention litigious, SOB's in town. If you're going after them, your case had better be iron clad. I'm going to need some more time. Be seated. So your client is still missing, Miss Simms? Sidebar, your honour? I will have no choice but to issue a bench warrant for her arrest. Is that clear? There are extraneous circumstances that the court should consider. Your honour, the people aren't interested in hearing excuses... My client has been attacked twice in the past week in her home. It was my understanding that a protection detail had been assigned to her. If she were truly afraid for her life, she should come to you, and to this court, and accept police protection. Counsellor, are you listening to me? I just need 24 hours to locate my client. This is a capital offense. Not a DUI. I'm issuing a warrant for Miss Simms' arrest. And if what you say is true, your sister will be safer with the police as she will be on the run. Hey. How are you doing? Hey, it's good to see you. Hi, you look really good. You too. Um... I need you to do this, I need you to come forward. This is my life we're talking about. I don't care about your stupid campaign. I'm sorry, I can't. No, Mark. I've got something here that might help you... What the... Look... that'll help you out, okay? I'm not... what the hell is this? I'm not... I can make a call for you... A call? That's all you're gi... I'm sorry. Mark! You know that I didn't... Hey. Hey, Sam. I saw the warrant. Yeah, if we don't find her soon, they're going to take the house to cover the bail bond, too. Look, are we any closer to figuring out what Trevor was up to? Maybe, I... something just occurred to me. Why wouldn't Brenda tell me what's going on, unless... I don't know, unless she's more than just afraid? Maybe she's ashamed? About what? These text messages. The file only shows the relevant text messages with Trevor. But... But what? If you go far enough back, he calls her Barb. Like the missing girl from the Beaumont. Wow. Yeah, corporate events my ass. Where is she? Miss Simms? What are you doing here? Where is your boss? Or your madam should I say? Where is she? Miss Simms. I find your demeanor inappropriate. My sister worked for you. And? You didn't think that would be relevant to my investigation? I thought you knew, you are her sister after all. You need to understand that given the sensitive nature of some of the services that we offer here, our girls often choose to use aliases. Are you hiding her? No. I advised her to leave town for her safety. You couldn't help her, so I did. You're lying. Brenda came to me after they started investigating her, she asked for my help. Do you have any idea what you've done? How this looks? She is now a fugitive! Authorities don't really have a lot of respect for people in my business. I always protect my girls. No matter the cost. You're protecting yourself, not my sister! Everything okay here? Fine, Wayne. Miss Simms was just leaving. What are you looking for? I'm sorry? You're looking for something. He was looking for something for you the other night and with Brenda the night before. Whatever it is, you better pray that you find it before I do. Brenda, hey, it's Sam... again. Um, I'm not calling to lecture you about coming back, I... I just... I wanted to tell you that I love you and that um... I'm so sorry that I left you, that was really wrong. Nothing you did or ever will do will change the fact that we are sisters. I just hope that wherever you are that you are safe. Promise me, just promise me that you'll do the right thing for you, whatever that is okay? I love you. Hello? Sam? It's me. Bren! Thank God you're okay! Sam, it's good to see you. You too. Whew. I haven't been here since the funeral. It was the last time I saw you before... all this. Look, you need to know they issued a warrant for you. And I know about the Beaumont. I know that you worked there as Barbara. I... I wanted to tell you... It's okay. I... It's just a job. At first I was a hostess there, seating people, running drinks or whatever. And it was okay money, it just wasn't enough. Kayleigh said I had what it took. That I could choose my own clients and it paid a lot. So, you weren't having an affair with Trevor, he was just a client? No, no I was seeing him, he was a client at first but he was just so charming, and he made me feel like I didn't need to be there anymore. So were you with a client when Trevor was murdered? No, I really was at home. I have no alibi, and the evidence was so strong. My car really was stolen, probably to frame me. Trevor used me to blackmail a client. Gina said something... Gina thought I was crazy for going along with it but it was good money. Trevor said it would be enough for him to quit IDG and I was gonna quit too. All I had to do was entertain the client and Trevor would record it. Hmm. The Senator. How... it doesn't matter. Look, I tried to stop it when I found out he was married. I tried to walk away but he... he didn't take it very well. No, no this is good Bren. This gives Mark motive to kill Trevor. Yeah, good luck proving it. They've been destroying the evidence ever since. If we could just find something. Something to connect Mark to Trevor... And what? They're gonna take a call girl's word for it? No, Mark paid a fortune to keep this a secret, there's no way he's gonna come clean. I met with him yesterday. Wait, you met with him? And he didn't try anything? No, I didn't think he would. Well, of course he would, you're the last loose end. No, he just tried to pay me off to leave town. He's a coward. Wait a minute, who else knew about the blackmail? Huh. You told Kayleigh. I was scared. Kayleigh had said that she was always going to protect me. Yeah, well Kayleigh's only protecting herself. If anybody ever knew what Trevor was up to, that would have been the end of her business. So, what's next? We've gotta find some evidence. How? I think I know. Come on. Hey, Beautiful. Hey, I've got Brenda. Good, is she okay? Yeah, she's okay. Listen, I think I have a lead on who might have killed Trevor. Great. Why don't you two come down to the station, we can talk about it here? You know I can't do that. She's a fugitive, you know that. She needs to turn herself in. I just need 24 hours. And another favour. If I counted all the rules I broke for you... Just meet me at the Beaumont after I drop Brenda off. I hope you know what you're doing. Don't I always? Yeah. I'll see you soon. It's five o'clock, this place should be getting ready to open. Maybe they're not open tonight. No, she'd be here. You think she skipped town? I don't think so. Oh god, I met her! Who is she, Sam? That's Gina. You know this one, too? Oh God, it's Kayleigh LeDuc. I'm gonna call this in, okay? This is Detective Brad Mortinson, I'm over at the Beaumont. Yeah. I've got two gunshot victims. We need the coroner, and CSI's. Okay. No, I'll be here. Units are on their way. I think somebody was here looking for evidence. When I was in Trevor's office the other night, I copied files onto a flash drive and uh... Kayleigh's friend took it. Alright, so maybe it's still here. I'm gonna look around, see if I can find a safe. No, wait, I... I think that's too obvious. I think she would have hidden it somewhere. Alright, where? Art fan? I've always loved that piece. That picture. The last time I was here it was framed. That one right there? Mmhmm. Okay. There's nothing behind it. Look at this. Bingo. So what now? Alright, so this puts Mark and Trevor together, and with Brenda's testimony, I mean this is enough to create reasonable doubt and hopefully get the whole thing thrown out. Alright, I'm gonna call this in, why don't you call Brenda and let her know what's going on, okay? Sam, how'd it go? Bren, hey uh... listen. Kayleigh and Gina are dead. Gina? What happened? I think she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So that means that... Mark Carey's behind this. I'll be home as soon as I can, just try and be safe, okay? What about Wayne? Who? Kayleigh's bodyguard! Put your gun down, kick it away. Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam. Alright. Wouldn't want a fair fight, would you? Guess you're a little nervous after our last little encounter, huh? Yeah, 'cause that worked out so well for you. You. Give me the drive. Stop! Are you okay? I'm good, I'm good. Wait, if Mark sent that guy to kill Kayleigh, he could be going after Brenda next! Alright, go check on Brenda, I'm gonna call this in alright? Leave a message at the tone. Bren, come on, call me back! Brenda? Brenda! BRENDA! Brenda? Bren! Oh my god! Didn't you hear me calling you? No! Alright. Mark killed Trevor because he was blackmailing him. Then he had Kayleigh killed to cover it up. We still don't have any proof. For all we know, this thug killed Trevor. I thought you said reasonable doubt was enough? Yeah, but we lost the drive. It's about more than just the case now. You are a loose end, and now that you're back in town, Mark is not going to take any chances. So what are we supposed to do? He's not gonna confess. Why not? You can't be serious. If he doesn't think anyone's listening. You need something to draw him out. Something he's willing to risk everything for. Trevor's blackmail proof. Kayleigh was looking for something else. It's gotta be the original proof that Trevor had, and they never found anything before the killed him! where is it? You already checked his computer, the cops searched his apartment... Kelsey. Kelsey Pope. Do you remember that lead you gave me, that security computer techie guy? Wait, what computer guy? Okay. Trevor got a program installed onto his computer that would allow him to access it remotely. And? So Kelsey said the bill had been returned to him. At first I thought it was because Trevor was dead. Check out this address. It's a downtown address. Trevor lived in Bryant, and this isn't IDG, either. I know that address. That's Mark Carey's house. He never had it installed on his own computer. He installed it on Mark's computer. Son of a gun. And I'll bet it's still there. And that's how he collected the proof! I know how we're gonna get him to talk. Goodnight, Mr. Carey! Goodnight! Hey! Ho... Honey... Hi. Hi. You wanna grab some dinner? Um, you know what? I've got a couple of errands I've gotta run, so why don't you pick a place and I'll meet you there? Okay, why don't I just make us something at home? That sounds great, I'll meet you at the house. Okay. Bye. So, what now? He's on his way? Should be, what if his goon shows up and tries to kill us? It's not gonna happen. He needs the evidence, he's not gonna touch us. Just stay calm. Okay, you ready to turn yourself in? Ready as ever. Get out of here. Hey, we're closed. Try your luck tomorrow. Alright. The fuzz. Mmm. What're we doing here? You installed software on a computer for Trevor Smith. I need you to access it for me. Ah, no can do, buddy boy. Confidential privacy whatever laws. Let's talk about those privacy laws for a minute. Are you aware that you installed that software illegally on a state senator's private computer? No? I'll uh... just bring that up then, shall I? Samantha Simms. We met a few days ago? Yeah. Of course, uh... I'm a little surprised to see you here... 911 What is your emergency? Look, I'm sorry, I'm a little confused here. I'm supposed to meet someone. I... I brought the money. Look, where's Barbara? Brenda is... She's right here. Alice, what are you doing here? My job. Making sure you get elected. What else? Are you okay? I'm fine. So you know about... About her? Yeah, I've known about her since Trevor tried to blackmail us. So what's your big plan, Miss Simms? You gonna try to record a confession? Wayne, search her. Wait a second, just... Oh come on. I don't think you appreciate the gravity of this situation. I appreciate that you killed Trevor and Kayleigh. Or, had them killed. Alice, is that true? Just stay out of this, okay Mark? Where's Trevor's evidence? Funny story, it's not actually here at IDG. You've had it all along. It's on Mark's laptop. You're telling me that Trevor installed software on my computer to monitor me? He was probably using the web cam to record the two of you. Alice, I'm sorry that you had to find out. You know what? Just shut up. Let's just get this over with. Where's the evidence? Here it is. Delete it. He was using your own computer against you this whole time. I didn't even know that Trevor was blackmailing me. How could you be so naive? How could you not know? Cause I didn't even... You didn't what, Mark? Spit it out! How could you not know? Because I didn't... You didn't what, Mark? You didn't wanna know, did you? You didn't what, Mark? You didn't wanna know, did you? You just want to leave it to me to clean up as usual. Shame on you, Alice. Oh, I'm sorry. Shame on me? Shame on you! This is juicy stuff. So I just keep recording? I want you to stay on it, Kelsey. Alright? I gotta head over there. How dare you? You were the one who couldn't be faithful. You're the one that threw away everything we have spent our entire lives working towards for some... So much for honesty and integrity, hey Mark? Doesn't give you the right... to kill people! Can't I? The affair, the blackmail, it all goes away after I'm done here. Is that really how you think of me? That I care so much about my career that I won't go and tell someone what happened? You don't have a choice, Mark. You think anyone's going to believe you're innocent after this? You can't keep hiding it, Alice. It's too big, now. Well, I might as well try. Wayne? Alice, listen to me. You see, the thing is, these are the last two loose ends. One sister ran away after she was accused of being a murderer and was never seen ever again. And the other was so distraught at her failure that she took her own life. You know what's tragic? I don't really care. That's unfortunate. 'Cause you see that little blinking icon at the bottom of the computer screen? Say 'Cheese', Alice. You're too late. What did you do? I had a friend re-activate the program. He caught your entire rant just now. Damn you! Alice, no! No! Aaaargh!!!!!!! Run! Okay, deep breath. We can do this. Wait, where are you going? We can either wait until he finds us, or take our chances on the offense. I don't know about you, Sam, but I am tired of hiding. Okay, okay, but we do it together. Yeah! Breathe. Stop! It's over. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent, and anything or do may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you... We're not clear on all of the details, but what we do know is that State Senator Mark Carey's wife and campaign manager Alice Walters has been arrested this morning, and evidence presented that appears to be connected to the murder trial of Brenda Simms. Meanwhile, Senator Carey is expected to make a full recovery, and had this to say to reporters at the University of Washington's medical centre. I owe my supporters and contributors an apology. I let them down. Something I often say comes to mind: it is important not only to speak for your principles, but to act on them as well. So let me say this: Brenda Simms is innocent of all charges. Simms is, of course, about to be cleared of all charges at a hearing later today. Marylin Steele, Channel Three News. Case dismissed. Thank you. I told you! Let's go. Thank you, for everything, Brad. It was nothing, Brenda, just doing my job. No, it wasn't nothing, what you did for me and Sam. It was more than that. She's right, we couldn't have done it without you. So now that's all said and done, what's next for you two adventurous young ladies? Well, I think I'm going to take a bit of a vacation, and reassess my career strategies. That's not a bad plan, actually. Let's get out of here. Looks like it's gonna rain. Yeah, I could use a little rain. Alright, you two, get a room.
