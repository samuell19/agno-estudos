You ought to see me when I had my bayonet, and I bop that, and I boop that, and then with my butt end I went like... Oh, I sure put it to 'em, black boy. Four white men, four. Oh, you ought to see me, I was going, go... Excuse me, fellas. - What you want? - What's the matter, Tump? Ain't nothin' the matter. You puffed up because cissie put you down for a ten? Has she done stuck me for a ten? Yeah, it's on that school subscription. Is that what you two was talking about all that time over at your house? Exactly. Now the proposition is this. Yeah? I've made a deal with Henry hooker, the banker, to buy the tomwit place south of town to build a school on. So I've raised a hundred dollars, that is, when you kick in with that ten cissie put you down to pay. So if you'll come across, you can come with me down to the bank to make a payment and get the contract. Well, uh, let me see how I can fix you. Get myself together and see how near I can get to it because I'm a little short anyway. Oh, hello boys. Hi, how you doing, Mr. Hooker? I just listened to a sermon on christianizing Africa by the reverend Blackwater, a preacher who is truly a man of god. We must help men like reverend Blackwater, bring these heathen savages into the path of god. Amen. Very true and very fine, Mr. Hooker, but what about the black heathens of the south? They're both civilized and christianized, yet live a life of misery in many places. Hooker's bend included until it's pitiful to behold. What about it, Mr. Hooker? That may not be your burden, you're an American citizen, but it's somebody's burden to try to improve this condition. And I have therefore dedicated my life to the task. Accordingly, I'm here to see about that deal. You came to see me about that land, Peter? Well, I'm very sorry to tell you, Peter, but you're too late for the tomwit place. How's that? Why, I bought the land. Yeah, but you paid nothing for your option on it, siner. Well, I had a clear-cut understanding with Mr. Tomwit. I'll go see Mr. Tomwit. It's no use, Peter. I'll explain, now, uh... Mr. Tomwit surprised me too, Peter, but no use talking about it. In the meantime, I don't like to see anything so important as the education of our colored people held up, so I've been trying to do something about it. So then rather than let your project be delayed, I'm going to offer you the old Dillihay place at exactly the same price, Peter, 800. 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Oh, well, thank you, Peter. I like a man of decision. Here's your deed to the Dillihay place and the deal is closed. - Good morning. - Goodbye, sir. Well, that was done proper and to the point, Tump, like a business proposition should be consummated. Uh, should be what, brother? Well, it was quick, all right. Don't suppose nobody could put a deed over on you with stoppers in it, does ya? We don't know any such word as “stop," Tump. Now, Peter, I know what's the matter. I didn't do you right. Why did you turn down my proposition, Mr. Tomwit, after we'd agreed and drawn up the papers? - Well, I had to do it, Peter. - Why, Mr. Tomwit? A white neighbor of mine wanted me to. Who, Mr. Tomwit? Henry hooker talked me into it, Peter. It was a mean trick, and I done you wrong. Henry hooker? You don't mean the cashier at the bank? Yep, there ain't but one Henry hooker. He's the one and only. He told me if I sold you any of my land that you all would put up a negro school and bring in so many blackbirds, you'd run me clean off my farm. Well, he said it would ruin the whole town, a negro school would. He didn't talk that way to me. Naturally, naturally. Henry has a different way of talking to every man, Peter. In fact, he just sold me the old Dillihay place in lieu of the deal I missed with you. The hell he did! Is that your deed? Let me see it. Well, I'll be danged! That little old Henry hooker always was a snake in the grass. He abused his position of trust. Why do you suppose he bought him the tomwit place and sold me the Dillihay tract? I wonder is that little old gimlet-headed white man clone put some stoppers in that deed he gave you. He might've. - Pitiful. - T'aint pitiful, I's talkin' sense, high-hat. Stoppers, what do you mean by stoppers? I mean negro-stoppers, you fool. Negro-stoppers? Listen to me, high-hat, I's bettin' I's right. Let me take a look at that deed. Oh, go on. I faded that deed with a ten spot, and I reckon I got a once-over comin' for my money. "This agreement is made today of the..." Something's up. I saw Henry hooker give siner a paper and met tomwit up the street who took the paper, looked at it and said something, then handed it back and walked away. Then siner and Tump had an argument, and now Tump's a-readin' the paper. Wonder what it's all about. A dollar to a donut, that Henry hooker's pulled a fast one on him. Well, let's have a Coca-Cola. "It is hereby agreed that..." There she am, there she am, a negro-stopper as sure as you is born. Let me see your mare's nest. It's there, now I reckon you'll understand what a stopper is. "Be it further understood and agreed that no negro, black man, Afro-American, mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, or any person whatsoever of colored blood or lineage, shall enter upon, serve, hold, occupy, reside upon, till, cultivate said property, or garner, cut, or harvest therefrom any of the usufruct timber, or emblements thereof, but shall by these presents be estopped from so doing forever." Why, that can't be legal. Legal? Legal, hell, anything a white man wants to put over on a negro on hooker's bend is legal. Through all the schools clean up to Harvard, and then you let a poor white man like Henry hooker put a fast one over on you. Well, ya fool. Hey, where you goin'? Look here, Peter, I advise you against anything you fix to do unless you rather cash in your checks. Hello, Peter, hear you been investin' in real estate. Peter, I advise you against anything you fixin' to do. Said, Peter! Wait a minute, man! - M r. Hooker. - Very busy now, Peter. I want to know about this deed. No time to talk about deeds now, Peter. But, there's a clause that's stoppin' colored people from occupyin' the place. Precisely, what about it? According to this, I can't establish a school on it. You cannot. Then what can I do with it? Sell it, I'll give you $10 for the option you hold in it, I... You mean you're willing to give me only $10 of the $100 I paid you not an hour ago? I'm not willing to give you anything, Peter, but I'll do so just to wipe the cloud the deed I gave you holds over it. I won't trade, you cheated me, here's your deed. Stop there, Peter! What's the matter? Oh, Peter there won't stick to his bargain and is walking away with a hundred dollars of the bank's money. Sick of your deal, Peter? Well, what you want done, Henry? Oh, nothing, I suppose... Siner was excited. You know how a negro is. We can't afford to put every one of them in jail that breaks the law. And let me give you a little friendly advice. I'd just run an ordinary school for Negroes, if I was you. This higher education that you have don't seem to make you any smarter when you come back than you were before you went away. Bobbs? That was a great sermon the reverend Blackwater preached. It made me want to help according to the lord who's blessed me, couldn't you spare $5 to go along with my contribution? Thanks, Bobbs. I've got the envelope ready, I'm dropping your five in with mine. $10 more for the great work. The salvation of the black heathens of Africa. Amen. Here, you better have this registered at the post office as you pass by, Bobbs. Good morning, Bobbs. It brings out what most of we southerners argue, that you can't educate a negro. He can be taught lines like an actor in a play, but he seldom understands what they mean, and siner is the best sample of it. Hooker sure pulled a fast one on him. He'll have a hard time living that down in hooker's bend. Negroes ain't got much confidence in each other no how. And this'll about wash educated Negroes up as leaders with them. It'll limit them to preaching and teaching. And I'll reckon this'll about finish siner's theory of higher education. After all I done done to keep you up there in school, you come back yellin' at a poor white man, make a fool of ya. Now everybody's iaughin' at us, both of us. Hello? - Hello, cissie. - Hello. Won't you come in? Here's some cookies, Mr. Siner. I thought you and aunt Caroline... Yeah? I imagine they's for me. Might like them. Certainly don't want no light-fingered hussy runnin' after my son and the whole deldine family'll bear watchin'. Won't you come in? Why, no, I just came by to... To fling herself in a pretty boy's face 'cause he's done been north and got made a fool of. - I'd better go now. - Wait, oh wait, cissie, until I get my hat, I'll go with you. Poor dear, I'm so sorry. Your mother certainly hates me, Peter. No, it's me. She's terribly let down about that deal. Your own mother turned against you. I don't blame her in a way. It seems so... stupid of me. The man seemed so sympathetic that I wasn't expecting a trick. Of course, you wasn't. The whole thing proved that you're a gentleman used to dealing with gentlemen. But, of course, these hooker's bend Negroes will never be able to see it or try to understand it that way. Still, cissie, I should've used the greatest care. I'm not talkin' about what you ought to have done, Peter. I'm talkin' about what you are. Well, one thing is sure, I've lost my friendship, whatever it was worth. With the others maybe. What are you going to do now? Find a way to get another hundred, I suppose, and read the deed before I do any paying this time. Bravo, Peter, bravo. I'm not the first man to make a mistake and get beat. That one mistake is not going to stop me. But my fist will, you yellow... Ah! I 'Clare fo' god, you ain't home a week before you're fightin' over a yellow hussy like a roustabout. - But, mother, I... - Me sweatin' over the wash-tub so you can go north and learn a little sense, only to see you come back home and start chasin' a dirty yellow hussy. Oh, mother, I was only walking home with miss Deldine. Miss Deldine, miss Deldine, if you mean that stuck-up yellow fly-by-night hussy, then say so, don't stand there mouthin' miss Deldine, miss Deldine. Oh, my boy. My son. Now, take a horse, sir. A horse can be trained to add and put his name together out of the alphabet. But no horse could ever write a promissory note or figure the interest on it, sir. I can't see no need to go into school like that then comin' back and iettin' a white man cheat you out your hide and tallow then let a black man beat you till you got to kick him in the spirit. Peter just ain't got it, Peter just ain't got it, man. The lord almighty has set his limit on dogs, horses, and Negroes, Mr. Tomwit. Thus far and no further. Now it seemed if education any good at all, you're bound to beat the white man at one end and the black man at the other. And if Peter can't be found at either end, then why is it? I don't know. Hold on, now, hold on. I've known as an intelligent a stallion as any. Now, what about siner and this gal? What you raisin' so much dust about? Did you think it was Henry hooker delivering that land you bought? What are you talking about? Dust thou art, to dust returnest? By the way, Peter, you haven't happened to see Tump pack, has you? Has he borrowed a gun from you? Huh, that's funny. What's funny? I mean about Tump. Oh, yes, Tump. I thought he must've borrowed a gun from you 'cause he left Hobbett's corner a while ago with a great big .45 inquirin' where you went. Maybe that's Tump now. But I guess I was mistooken. Tump did start over this way with a gun sure enough. He met Dawson Bobbs on the way, and, uh... Where is he now, locked up? No, not just exactly. All right, all right, now exactly what did happen? This, throgmartin had been trying to hire Tump to pick cotton. Offered him $3 a day, but Tump had just thrown four natchels and wouldn't go. So then he gets arrested for carryin' concealed squidjulums. Now throgmartin have got him workin' out his fine and pickin' cotton for nothin'. So long. Psst cissie! Cissie! Oh, Peter, come around here. Oh, Peter, I'm so glad to see you, although I didn't expect to. Thanks. I came by with news. Bad news, I'm sorry to say. Oh, Peter, what is it? You haven't been... Not that, not that again, Peter. Oh, no, cissie, not that, of course not that. But it's about Tump. Oh... Tump. Well, what about him? He's been arrested. What, again? But that's not fair. Please, come in. Then you can tell me all about it. What did they arrest him for? Carrying a pistol. To shoot you with. Oh, this is sickening, Peter, sickening. Peter, it's hard to be nice in this place. I just happen to think how folks would gossip about you. Comin' here so soon after Tump was arrested. Perhaps I'd better go. H no, I'm really glad you came. I didn't mean it that way. I've been uneasy about you. I'm not so easy killed. I've completely recovered my equilibrium. I'm determined to see what I have started through. In a way, Peter, we, uh... You and I don't belong here and we'll never get anywhere as long as we stay here. Why don't you go away, Peter? Away up north, where most of our educated people have gone. Up north where you can be free. You can't grow up and develop here. They simply won't let you. And especially now, when everyone doubts you. - If you go north... - What about you, cissie? Oh, I'm a woman. We haven't the chance to do as we want to. Then you're going to stay here and marry Tump? I don't know what I'm going to do. God help me. You, you don't care for Tump? North, dear, and soon. Just you and I, cissie, you and I. Oh, I'll be so glad! So glad. So glad! - Well, mother. - Where you goin', son? For a walk, mother. You go out of that Cissie Deldine's, Peter. No, I'm going to walk by myself. I'm tired, played out. Tired? Played out? You ain't done nothin' but sit and turn through some books and write on a little piece of paper. Even that gets tiresome after a while. Peter, you knows if Tump pack sees ya, he's gonna shoot you, sure. Oh, no he won't, that's Tump's talk. Talk? That ape done got crowned for killing four men already. Come in the house, son, and eat some supper. I just made some salmon croquettes for you that'll spoil if you don't eat 'em now. I didn't know you were making croquettes. Yes, I got a can of salmon from miss Cromwell that she opened and couldn't quite use. Look here, mother, you're not using old canned goods that have been left over? I've told and told you about using any tainted or impure foods that the white people can't eat. It's too bad for them, it's too bad for you. You must absolutely quit eating leftovers. Don't be so hasty, Peter, 'cause you done been brought up on leftovers. Is that you, son? Yes, it's me, mother. What's the matter, dear, are you sick? I ain't feelin' so well. It's my stomach. Well, mother, you are sick. What can I do? Here... fill it, from the kettle. You need a doctor and quickly. I'll go for Jallup. Sorry we ain't a telephone to maybe get him quicker. I'll go now, I'll run. Meantime, I'll go by nan Berry and send her here to look after you till I get back. If Dr. Jallup should argue, then go see captain Renfrew. You know where he lives, the big house on the hill. - My mother's sick, doctor. - Who is it? Caroline siner, she's been taken suddenly with... The fat negro who live in the three-room house on 12th street, isn't she? - I'll show you the way. - No, Caroline siner owes me a $5 doctor bill already. Our county medical association has made a rule that no negro should... But, great heavens, doctor, she's dangerously ill, she might die, I'll pay you. Have you got the money there in your pocket? No, but I can get it. Yes, you can all get it. I'm tired of you Negroes running up doctor bills nobody can collect. You never have any money, your wages are never large enough to garnishee. No, I'm not going. If you want me to visit her, go get $10, five for the old debt, the balance of this visit, and I'll... If Dr. Jallup should argue, go see captain Renfrew. Uh, well, who is it? My name is siner, Peter siner. My mother has been taken suddenly "I. I visited Dr. Jallup but he won't go. Peter siner, and Caroline is sick, well, now that's too bad. Step inside, I'll call up Jallup and have him stop here and pick us up, and we can go and see what's wrong with Caroline. Now won't you step in, please? She's mighty bad, doctor Well, well, Caroline, what's this all about? I'm sick, doctor, awful sick. Now, now, Caroline, don't talk that way. I'm going to fix you up quickly. Quickly. So that's, that's why I cannot marry you, Peter. You mean, morals? I see. I was stupid. Well, I'm glad it's over. I'm glad you know. You see, Peter, if you had been like Tump pack, or wince, or any of the other boys around here, it wouldn't make much difference. But you went off and learned to feel and think like a white man. I... you changed your code, Peter. I don't think that was fair for you to go away and change your code, then come back and judge us according to your new code. You see, Peter, we couldn't change ours. We had to stay here and we couldn't change ours. If you didn't know anything about my code, how do you know what I feel now? I found out the other night when you kissed me. It was too late then. Her confession has destroyed all my plans. It has left me as adynamic as my mother's death. It seems there are certain similarities between the two events. Both were sudden and desolating. And yet, as my mother had vanished utterly from my reach, so now it seems that cissie is no more. Cissie the clear-eyed, cissie the ambitious, cissie the refined has vanished away. And in her place stands a thief, more than a thief. Oh god, forgive me. Forgive me! Well, you were deliberate in coming. I sent you word by some black rascal three days ago. - I just got your message today. - Well, won't you come in and we can talk this over if you don't mind? - I don't mind, captain. - Go right in. I'm growing old. And as a scholar and a thinker, I feel that I should give the fruits of my leisure to the world. That, in short, Peter, is why I've sent for you. - I'm deeply gratified. - I asked you to come here for another reason. I need a man about this house, now that is one phase of the work. The more important work is that you will act as sort of secretary. I have a manuscript in the house here. My handwriting is rather difficult. I want you to copy the matter in it and get it ready for the printer. Are you offering me a permanent place, captain Renfrew? I need a man with a certain liberality of culture. I may no doubt get you to look over books and periodicals, and make notes of any points germane with my thesis. This is very flattering, captain, but the fact is, I came by your house at this time because I'm just in the act of leaving on the steamboat tonight. You're leaving hooker's bend? - Yes, sir. - Well, why? Well, my mother's dead. Well, I know, but Peter, your work is still here. A man's work, Peter, a man's work. You mean my school teaching? Peter, I want you to remain with me for another reason. I'm an old man and anything could happen to me in this big house. I don't like to think of it. Then, you mean, you want me to stay with you until the end, captain? That's my desires. And in my death, you'll receive a certain portion of my estate because I have no other heir. I am the last of the race of the Renfrew, Peter, the last. Well now, Rose, I have a guest who has come to stay with me permanently. He will perhaps wish his breakfast served in his room. - He's in the east room. - Yes, sir. Come in. Well, for lord's sake! Is I bringing this breakfast to a negro? I suppose it, ma'am. Well, what for? What for is you ain't come to the kitchen and eat off from the chef? Is you sick? I've never felt better in my life. Then, what the devil has I got into? I ain't wanna work no such place. Hand breakfast to a beef of a negro, stout as a mule. Say, what you doing here, anyhow? How come this? Now, now, Rose, I'm here to do some writing for the captain and other things. Well, poor lord, when spooks get to write for white folks, heads'll be jumping from bullfrogs and having other Negroes wait on them. You's just as much a spook as I is. This is the last mouthful I fetches to you or any other jigwalk, Peter Siner. You ain't no black Jesus. Even if you is a woods calf. What did you say? You heard me. Yes, I did and since I can't seem to get along with you by trying to be nice and considerate, I'll... Well, it looks like Peter put something over on Tump. Maybe an education does help a negro some after all. There's telling around town how Peter's gonna marry Tump's girl while Tump is working out his fine up on your farm. And talking about siner, they say he's living up at old captain Renfrew's now. Yeah, old Rose Hobbett says he's up there doing some kind of writing and living in one of the captain's best rooms. Yeah, that's true, but she could hardly make up a lie like that. Old captain's getting old and childish and that educated negro's taking advantage of him. If old captain Renfrew wasn't the richest man in this town, we could make up some kind of a charge and take that negro out of there. I'll tell ya, an educated negro is a dangerous thing to have around. Get off of this line! Just an officer of the law discussing official business with an important man. Yeah, that's true. I hope it chokes ya. Come in. Captain Renfrew wants to see you in the library. When? Right now? Yeah, right now. Everything he wants, he wants it now. Good evening, captain. Oh, good evening, Peter. By the way, I sent for you. Yes, sir, I believe you wanted me. Oh, yes, Peter, I... Downtown, I heard a rumor, well, connected with you, that I... I don't want to intrude on your private affairs, not at all, not in the least. But... are you thinking of leaving me? Why no, not at all. Who told you I was? Well, to be exact, I heard that you were going to marry. Marry? Whoever in the world could've told you that? Are you? Indeed no. I heard that you were going to marry a Negress here in town called cissie Deldine. But I'm not, that's settled. You say that it's settled? Yes. You had thought of it, maybe considered it? Well, at least that eases my mind, it eases my mind. It's not only the thought of losing you, Peter, but this girl that you are thinking of marrying is... well, let me warn you, she's a Negress. A Negress? I don't exactly mean a Negress, I... She's a thief. And furthermore, she's not a good girl. I couldn't endure seeing you married to a thief. Yes, yes, I've heard that before. Well, that's all, Peter. Good night. Good night, captain Renfrew. No, he didn't Because I asked him and he said he didn't. Well, I said I didn't, too. He's a negro like I am. We just two Negroes. And lookit here, if you was worried to put one of us ahead of the other, it's 'Kay to lock a door with me. Well, what do you mean lock a door with you? You know what I mean. I means I'd wanna leave this place. No, no, look here, Rose, Peter siner occupies almost a fiduciary relation to me. A relation to you? Yes, Peter siner occupies a position of trust with me. Yeah, I sees you trust him. Someday, he's going to be of service to me, of great service to me. You know better than anybody else, Rose, my dread of some unmannerly death. I... and Peter has promised to remain with me until the end. Which end? - Which end? - Yeah. Your end or Peter's end? By every law of probability, Peter will outlive me. Yeah, Peter'll come to an end with you when he marries that stuck-up, yellow, fly-by-night, cissie Deldine. He's not going to marry her. He told me he didn't intend to marry her. Good lord, what difference does it make what Peter say? Ain't you found out when a he-negro and a she-negro get to peep at each other? What they say don't live in the same neighborhood with what they does. No, that'll do, Rose, that'll do. That's all I need of you. Pardon my intrusion, Peter, but I'd like to have a word with you. I... I've mentioned this subject before. Yes, sir? It's about cissie Deldine. Yes, sir, you mentioned that before. Listen, Peter, you don't want to do what's on your mind. What's on my mind? Marry a Negress. You don't want to marry a Negress. Not marry a Negress? No, Peter, no. For yourself, it may make no difference, but your children, think of your children. Your sons growing up under a brown veil, a veil that you can't tear off, that god himself can't tear off. Your children, Peter, your children's children. A terrible procession stretching out, out, marching on under a dark shroud, unknowing, unknown. And all you can see, Peter, is their sad forms beneath the shroud marching away, away to god knows where. And yet, it's your own flesh and blood. But captain, whom should I marry? No one, Peter. Let your seed wither in your loin, it is better that way. It's better. Peter? Oh, Peter? May I come in? You don't seem to be very glad to see me, Peter. But I am, cissie. Very glad, won't you sit down? What a wonderful room. It is very nice. And what beautiful drapes. Are they velour? I wonder how they would look spread. Perhaps I better build a fire? Oh, no, I'm just gonna stay a few minutes. I don't know what you'll think of me, Peter. I'm really glad you came. Are you, Peter? I really came by to ask you to help me. I want you to help me go away. They have no feeling for a colored girl, Peter. No, not a speck. When one of us even walks past on the street, they whistle and say all kinds of things out loud, just as if we weren't there at all! They... they don't care. We're just... Just colored women. Oh... oh, they make you feel naked. Oh, cissie, please. She's there, Mr. Bobbs. I just now see'd her go'd in. All right, come on. All right, we'll wait here till she comes out and then nab her. But I don't want to travel alone, Peter. I don't want to go away alone. You... you mean you want me to go with you, cissie? Now, listen, you black rascal! If that gal gets away from me tonight, there'll be a dead persimmon in the morning. Now, get on up there, you baboon, and see if he's still there! Listen, Peter, I'm not the kind of woman you think, the whole town thinks. If I hadn't accused myself, we'd be married now. I've done some things that I regret and am ashamed of because I've stolen. I stole a Turkey roaster and brought you something nice to eat in. And I stole a brooch because you said I needed one and I wanted to look nice to please you. But that is all the sin I've committed. I raise my hand and swear that is all, Peter. But I know all hooker's bend is calling and pointing me out as the town's worst woman and I can't stand it any longer. I've got to go away! There, there, darling, cissie, darling, don't cry anymore. I love you, cissie. I've loved you since the first day I saw you. If you hadn't told me this before, that you had only stolen, we would've been married and I would be helping you. I'm going to help you now. The dogs is after me, the dogs is after me! They were after you, dear. But Providence in the dog that saved you. I believe anyone would trust you now, cissie. And, dear, I love you so much. But you must go now, hurry. Go somewhere and hide. Send me word, stay hidden until I can arrange to slip you away. And remember now and always, cissie, that I love you. Love you. Turn around, fella, and beat it! Beat it! Hey, black man, don't shoot down this way till I make my exit. I needn't be scared you, fool rabbit. I been looking for you for some time, Peter. Didn't know you was back. Why you been looking for me? No you don't. Turn around and march on to darktown. What for? I'm gonna drop you in the main street well, the jigs that's been bragging about you and cissie can see that I ain't gonna take no fumdingling from nobody. Tump, you oughtn't shoot Peter. His mammy just died. Then she won't worry none. Turn around! And when I say march, you march. Attention! Right, about face! March! What are you doing with the gun, Tump? I thought it was against the law to carry one. You can carry 'em if you don't keep 'em hid. Mr. Bobbs told me that when he guve my gun to me. So, he gave it back, eh? After giving you 30 days for carrying it, he frees you and gives it back. What for? How in the devil do I know? And what's more, I don't care! All I know I got it and I's gonna drill the daylights through you as soon as we get to darktown. Come on, let's go. Wait a minute, Tump. Bobbs don't like me. I broke no laws and have never done anything to him. But he wants me out of the way, so he gave you the gun figuring you'd shoot me with it. I don't care nothing about woofer. All I know, you done stole my gal and I'm gonna kill you for it. Come on, let's go! Come on! Tump, I'm not gonna marry cissie. I know you ain't, Peter. I mean, if you let me alone, I don't intend to. I'm... I ain't gonna let you alone, Peter. Do you think this is the best thing to do, Tump? Shut your black mouth! What I care about what you said? You done wean cissie away from me. She won't even speak to me, she won't even look at me, all on account of you. I oughta drop you right here and now. Go on, shut up, march! Go on! Go ahead. We's going on the town. I mean, we going on, go on. Now, none of that, none of that, boys. You'll probably hit the gal if you shoot and I'll pick you off one at a time like three black crows. You're going up to the big house, gal. Peter, has Mr. Bobbs done arrested cissie? I don't know, Tump, it looks like it. For goodness sakes, cissie's arrested. Mine and your little deal's off, Peter. We got to save cissie. I wonder what she done done. She don't shoot crap and she don't bootleg, no. Let's go to her home. Yeah. I know she done something, I know she done something. You ain't never been in jail, is you, yellow boy? It sure ain't no place for a woman, it's no place for a woman. I hear that she done commit grand larceny and they gonna take her to the pen. Grand larceny, what's that? Dumbbell, that's taking more from the white folks in one time than they expect you to take. Mrs. Deldine. She took a brooch. They kept laying around in her way. It was that Sam Arkwright who did it. He wanted her to... oh, Peter. It's too terrible to tell. Give it time. And last night, they had that old persimmon to watch her when she went to see you. They intended arresting her then, but cissie took the dog with her and he run 'em away. But when she stole home a while ago to get a bite to eat, the persimmon was watching and runs and gets Bobbs. Oh, Peter, what'll we do? What'll we do, Peter? I'll save you, cissie. Don't be afraid. It's Tump and I's a coming! Attention! Right, about face! Now. Over the top! Peter! Action up at jonesboro last night, Peter. - Yeah? - Yeah. Tump pack got killed. Jailed delivered. Cissie Deldine escaped. But I'll get her, Peter. Dawson Bobbs always gets his Negroes, Peter. Yeah. Always. Now, me and the sheriff, we knew Tump pretty well and we know he'd never figure out a scheme to free that gal like that. But we figured is how it might have popped into the head of an educated negro like you, Peter, yeah. If you're hinting at me, I can assure you I had nothing to do with it or knew nothing of any such plan. I don't know the girl escaped till you told me just now. Maybe. You know, I've been thinking a lot about you lately, Peter, and if I was you, yeah, I'd just drift along quietly out of this here town. You know, white folks and Negroes got along pretty well around here till you got back from school, but since you got back, a lot of unpleasant things have been happening. Now, for instance, the report got around last night it was you who got killed instead of Tump pack, and when old captain Renfrew heard it, he just up and actually dropped dead. Oh, no, captain Renfrew's not dead! You know, Peter, things continue to happen around here and we don't like it. Now, there ain't room in this here town for the white folks and an educated negro like you. So, if I was you, I'd just drift on away quietly, Peter. Quietly.

Ida may! Oh, Ida May! Cissie, my sister! What on earth? Oh, Ida May! Come inside. Cissie, my poor sister, whatever happened? How come you're here like this? I'm... I'm a thief, Ida May. I stole a brooch at Mrs. Arkwright's house, and when I failed to meet Sam as he asked me to, he swore out a warrant and Bobbs arrested me. They put me in jail. Oh! Tump pack held up the jail and made them let me go and I ran away. When I'd gone about a block, I heard a shot and turning around saw Tump fall dead. The warfields took me to the country and kept me hidden for three days. Then, one night, I slipped out and saw the persimmon peeping through the bushes. I didn't want to get the warfields into trouble. So, after midnight, I slipped away. It was nearly sundown the next day and almost starved, I went up to a cabin in the woods to ask for food. Went about two miles down the road, I heard the dogs, the bloodhounds were on my trail. It must've been around midnight. I could tell for the moon was shining. I had run though creeks, swamps, over mountains, but I couldn't get rid of those dogs or the persimmon. I decided to give up. It seemed so hopeless. But as I turned, I saw the ugly face of the persimmon rise up behind a bush and turning, he calls loudly, "here she am, Mr. Bobbs! I done caught up with her!" I went suddenly crazy. I decided to run until I dropped dead, and turning I flew. I don't know how far I'd gone when suddenly, I found myself in the middle of a wide, paved highway where I stopped. I heard a truck and before persimmon and the dogs could catch up, I looked and the driver was Tump's brother. Cissie! Why you dirty...! A dirty son of a gun. Well, he'll never betray another negro. Well, cissie, you poor little thing. He dropped me off outside, but there's no use, Ida May. What you mean there's no use? Honey, I'll have you fixed up in a jiffy and you'll be off to Chicago before you can say... I told you there was no use! It's Bobbs and the law and they're gonna take me back to hooker's bend! - Peter! - Ida may. I'm looking for cissie, is she here? Oh, cissie, my darling. It's no use, Peter. I'm a thief and no good. So, let Mr. Bobbs take me on back to hooker's bend and hang me. Mr. Bobbs won't be here. No one's going to hang you. Instead, cissie, we're going to get married and live happily till we die. Here, Ida May, read this telegram I just received. "Peter siner, care of western union, Nashville, Tennessee. Find cissie and bring her home. Everything has been adjusted. Mrs. Arkwright canceled the warrant Sam took out for her arrest and sent Sam away to a reform school. They probated captain Renfrew's will today and a great surprise awaits you. So, find cissie and bring her home at once." Wait, here's some more. "They found the persimmon's body on the road to Nashville. He'd been shot three times. Nobody knows who did it." They're trucking! Let's be happy again for cissie, poor cissie. Yes, Ida May, let's celebrate for cissie because she suffered so much. And when they filed old Renfrew's will for probate, what do you reckon they found? What? That he left everything that he owned to that negro, Peter siner. The devil, you say! Every last dime. Including the stock in the bank and he owned 90 percent of it. It looks like the end of Henry hooker to me. Well, I'll be jiggered. And what's siner gonna do with it? Well, what's so funny about it? He's gonna turn old Renfrew's mansion on the hill into a seminary for negro gals and that 3,000 acre plantation with all its buildings and equipment into an industrial school for colored boys. How does that strike you, tomwit? Well, dear, now that we're married, and you're mine forever, we'll drive to Chicago for a brief honeymoon, then back here to begin our life's work. Yes, Peter, dear. But listen to this, tomwit! While you was away, siner made a speech right here in courthouse square. Most of the audience was white, the best people in town, and some come over from jonesboro to hear him, mind you. White people! The best white people. What'd they say? Oh, plenty! Among the many things he did say was that he intended to break up loafing on Hobbett's corner, that it was an eyesore to the town and a bleeding stop for. So, he proposed to the city council that Bobbs be ordered to arrest every man, especially Negroes, found loafing there for more than 10 minutes. What'd he propose to do with 'em? Oh, he had that all figured out in advance. Yeah, he had everything figured out and in advance. Yeah! He wants to arrest all Negroes so, and place them in custody and on parole at the school for an indefinite period and during which time he guarantees to work them so hard on that farm until they be too tired to loaf. And he intends to make good farmers out of 'em before he turns 'em loose. Well, how'd the audience take it? The white audience? Ate it up. And they applauded every few seconds and crowded around him when he was through and said that if he needed any money... Help, or money, or anything he needed, just to call on them, but the biggest surprise of the evening was on the part of Bobbs. Bobbs listening to siner? And bowed to him and smiled when it was over. And hooker? Oh, hooker, well, he couldn't take it.
