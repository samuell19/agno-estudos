[♪♪♪] [GASPS] [DOG BARKING] [GASPS] [DOG BARKING, GROWLING] Come on. I think I've had enough of this city for one day. I'll ask you again, Mr. Capello... or do you prefer DeAndria, or Nicky the Knife? I lose track with all your aliases. I object, Your Honor. I think by now defense counsel is familiar with the witness' name. I expect closing arguments today, Mr. Stein, so please skip the theatrics you've so adroitly managed to slip in during this entire trial and ask your question. Mr. Capello, you have admitted that you have killed on occasion. On Ringerman's orders. [GALLERY MURMURING] You've also told us you've lied for Mr. Ringerman in the past. Hey, I'm a stand-up guy. I work for somebody, I work for 'em, no matter what it takes. Yet you're here today trying to put Mr. Ringerman in jail for a crime he did not commit. He committed it. I saw it. I was there. You admit you lie? Why should the jury assume that you're not lying to them? Because I ain't. Don't insult the court, Mr. Capello. Did you or did you not make a deal with the DA's office in return for your testimony? UNDERWOOD: Objection. That has no bearing. If you're working for the DA now like you did for Mr. Ringerman, would you lie for the DA? Objection! Would you lie to stay out of jail like in the past? I object! Sustained. Counsels, approach the bench. [GALLERY MURMURING] He got us good. We still have our last witness. [♪♪♪] Closing arguments immediately after recess. UNDERWOOD: I have one more rebuttal witness. STEIN: I know nothing of any other witness. I object. UNDERWOOD: This witness was afraid. She feared for her life and would not come forward until today. Mr. Stein knows who this witness is by name, and he knows what she will do to his case if he keeps her from testifying. JUDGE: If you feel this witness's testimony will have that much effect on the case, bring her forth. The court calls Madilyn Dougherty to the stand. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] I don't know, Dan. Something's wrong with her. BAILIFF: Do you solemnly affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? MADILYN: I do. UNDERWOOD: Miss Dougherty... will you please tell the court exactly what you told my assistant early this morning? I... I... Take your time, Miss Dougherty. No one is going to hurt you. Just speak the truth. Please tell the court your connection to Mr. Ringerman. I... don't have one. You don't have-- Miss Dougherty, don't you work for the Argent Corporation as a bookkeeper? And didn't you, while working with the company ledgers, come across evidence that proves that Mr. Ringerman not only is a secret owner of the company but that the company itself is nothing more than a money laundering front for Mr. Ringerman? I know nothing about any of that, and I have no proof. [GALLERY MURMURING] Miss Dougherty, you told my assistant something very different this morning. I was mistaken. How could you be mistaken? You came forward voluntarily. I was confused. I was mistaken. I don't know anything about Mr. Ringerman. Your Honor, this witness is obviously terrified. I object. There is no evidence to support counsel's statement. I have to agree with Mr. Stein. Does the witness realize the seriousness of perjuring her admission to the DA's office this morning? [♪♪♪] I don't know anything... Anything about Mr. Ringerman's business. REPORTER: Here they come. Mr. Ringerman, can you give me anything for the evening news? We were confident in the legal system all along and in the jury. Can I have a comment? Mr. Ringerman has no comment to make at this time. Thank you very much. No further comment, thank you. Thank you very much. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] I don't know what to say. Whatever there was to say, it should've been said in here. I understand if you press charges against me. I think we're done pressing charges in any matters regarding Thomas Ringerman. We had our shot. Justice wasn't on our side. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? MAN: You follow directions well. Very well. All right, now let him go. I did exactly what you wanted. Now let my brother go. Just continue to do as you're told, and you'll get what you want. That's the way it works. I did what you wanted. You said-- I said do as you're told! You're not done doing that. Get a pen and piece of paper. Write this down, because if you forget, you'll have no way of reaching your brother ever again. Along the pier near 10th Street, walk past the warehouse with the old Cavanaugh Maritime and Salvage sign. Hope to see you there, but probably not as much as your brother does. And be careful. It's not a neighborhood for a pretty lady to be wandering around in at night. [LINE CLICKS, THEN DIAL TONE] [♪♪♪] Remember telling ghost stories as a kid? Remember turning all the lights off and huddling together with a flashlight and trying to dream up the worst nightmares possible? Well, I bet you've never dreamt up anything like me. We're gonna have a scary time. Me, you... and your sister. [WHISTLES] [LAUGHING] I love this crap. SONNY: Good to see you laughin' again, Tommy. It's been a while. That judge took care of you. He didn't give that DA an inch. It wouldn't have been the same last year if Cain had been on the bench. I don't get nervous about little girls with big mouths. I don't get nervous about dead men. If I had to worry about dead men, I'd have 10 times as many worries as I have now. Some guys think, you know, he's still around. I mean, you must've heard. Toomey says it was Judge Cain who nailed him and Patty Boxcars last month. [CHUCKLES] Toomey's doing his time at the state laughing academy. You don't think he was serious, do you? He didn't wanna do hard time, so he came up with that "Cain still being alive" garbage to help him cop a plea for soft walls. He'll be out in a few years with pottery he made for us all. He never said Cain was still alive. Enough! She's here. [CHUCKLING] [♪♪♪] [THUNDER CRASHES] [RINGERMAN LAUGHING] Madilyn, we were just talking about coming back from the dead, and you and your brother can give us a firsthand report whether or not that's possible. Just let Patrick go. Please. Please just let him go. He won't-- He can't do anything to you. You're so right. No one can do anything to me. Not your brother, not you, not the police... not even ghosts. [LAUGHING] [THUNDER CRASHES] What the hell?! Boo! See a ghost? No, I-- Heh-heh. Hey, I just, uh-- Makin' sure she didn't bring anybody. She didn't bring anybody. Did you, Madilyn? No. [THUNDER CRASHING] She knows better than that. What about m-my brother? Go kill him. Make him scream loud enough for her to hear. No! No, no! [MADILYN SCREAMING] [RINGERMAN LAUGHING] Hey, did you guys give him a new wardrobe to be buried in? [♪♪♪] What the hell is this?. [GROANING] Jilly? [BEEPING] Tommy? Tommy, you there? Shut up! Keep quiet. [MUFFLED GASPING] Your brother is safe. Whoever the hell you are, there better be more than one of you! What the hell do you think you're doing? MAN: I accuse Thomas Ringerman, head of the largest drug- smuggling racket in the city, personally responsible for hundreds of thousands of ruined lives, children's deaths, all caused by the poison you import and sell. You, Thomas Ringerman, I find guilty! And I find you dead! MAN: I accuse Ramon "Sonny" Santiago. I charge you with extortion, drug smuggling, kidnapping, attempted murder and murder. And you, too, I find guilty. What the--? [THUNDER CRASHES] [GRUNTS] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] What did you do to him? Okay, man. Okay, what is this? What are you doing? Who are you? MAN: I'm your judge and jury. And if necessary, I'm your executioner. You're crazy! [MAN LAUGHING] [TRIGGER CLICKING] [YELPS] [WHIRRING] What the hell are you? You're a robot. You're a damned robot! No, Ringerman. I'm a ghost story. [SCREAMING] I confess to the charges of kidnapping Patrick Dougherty. Kidnapping him with the intent of forcing Madilyn Dougherty to change her testimony. Her testimony would've sunk me. And I knew, to save her brother's life, she would do anything... even lie in open court. Right there, "to save his life." That's it. He admits he was planning to kill him. You're going to have to go over this again and again and again, here and in court. You have no idea who it was who gave you this videotape, who it was that saved you? I mean, mystery men who materialize from the night sky don't cut it for a jury, and this testimony could get thrown out, except... Except what? Except when I contacted Stein, Ringerman's attorney, this morning, he'd already spoken with his client. Ringerman wants to try to make a deal. He's not even trying to say he was coerced into a confession? No, he's not. Which makes no sense. It makes no damn sense at all. Unless he's afraid. More afraid than going to jail. Afraid of what, though? Of who? Of ghosts. Ghosts? [♪♪♪] [CHIMING SOFTLY] [BEEPING] [TV BROADCASTS OVERLAPPING] RAE: From what I hear of Tommy Ringerman, he won't give up till he sees you dead. He already has. You spook me too when you get this way, judge. A word of friendly advice. You're gettin' off on this Dark Avenger gig way too much. Computers, electronics, even some makeup. I didn't know your expertise spilled over into psychoanalysis. Just, uh, stuff I pick up from the prison shrink and the freako movies I used to see as a kid. All them deformed guys start to go bonkers after a while. It's strain from having to hide in the dark so long. The only strain I might feel is having to put up with this thrift-shop equipment you send me out there with. Hey, hey, hey, thrift shop, my tuchus. I use the same components you find in anything made by Sony. Well, when I want to take on the criminal element with a VCR, I'll call. Oh, wait, what'd you do, downfield block an express train? Hey, one of Ringerman's associates tried to take off my arm with a pipe. How much longer you think you can get away with this, judge? I mean, sooner or later, someone's gonna figure you out. No one will figure me out. Not unless somebody tells 'em. Don't run that rap on me. I'd be doin' hard time on the dark side of Pluto if not for you. I just... Speakin' of which, I gotta get back to my nice, safe cell tonight or I'm gonna get in deep guano and blow the work furlough you got me. You should've left. Nah, I just wanted to finish up some work on this new tear-gas pellet. I think I found a way we can load it under the laser. What would you say if I could put you into all the police interrogation rooms at Central? They cabled up the building and all the cameras are centrally linked. And you say you're not into all this? Oh, don't get me wrong, you know. I'm not into throwin' on strange get-ups and scarin' the crap out of bad guys with a whisper, but you and me, we're like... Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse. Why, Rae, be careful. Your emotions are showing. I don't care any farther than being concerned with who gets all this if you don't come back one day. I mean, I built all this stuff. I feel, you know, owner-like. Except for however many of those hats you got layin' around, which I would not be caught dead in. Scratch that. But I don't know what happens once you walk out your secret panel there. Now, like this Ringerman. He can be a real bad dude. So can I. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [SCREAMING] REPORTER [ON TV]: The Grim Reaper has struck again. Police say the Reaper claimed his fourth victim earlier this evening in the exclusive Oakhurst District of the city. Like the other Reaper victims, Janis Elwick was in her early 20s, attractive and alone. [BROADCAST CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Is that like a King Kong laser or what? Anyway, here are the blueprints to Central Division downtown. I think if we mount a microwave dish on a building above the west side, we can pull in from the main terminal. Yes, no, maybe? Until now, there has been no indication by the police that there have been any suspects in the case. Indeed, that there have been any leads at all. But tonight Captain Strauss has implied otherwise. Oy vey.Heh. You can't wait for that one to be on trial, can you? On the warpath again. We put one to bed, and already you're lookin' to be back on the case. I might be back on the case. You're gonna be back in jail. [ENGINE POWERING UP] Turbines to speed, batteries to power, bat thrusters ready. [CHUCKLES] When we do this, I can't resist, heh. See, Rae, talk to your shrink. There's a little Lone Ranger in all of us. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] We spoke earlier today with Captain David Strauss and Commissioner Peter Kinghorn. KINGHORN: The entire police department was caught off guard by this turnaround in the Thomas Ringerman case, but as long as truth prevails and matters reach their proper end, then justice has been served. The department is here to see that happens. REPORTER: What about the Grim Reaper? Is it true you have a suspect? I'll address that later today, all right? REPORTER: There's a rumor that you have a confession. Like I said, there'll be a formal explanation from Captain Strauss later today. Now, thank you very much. No more questions. REPORTER: But, commissioner-- Just once I'm dyin' to see you catch a couple of minutes of Wheel of Fortune or Pink Panther or something truly frivolous, like a guy in a black hat would watch. I mean, you have seen Casablanca,haven't you? Everyone's seen Casablanca,right? [♪♪♪] You know, not that I'm crazy about this gig, but, uh, we never have any company picnics, office Christmas parties, no softball league. You think we take our jobs too seriously? I never get an end-of-the-year bonus. Well, we haven't been together for a year yet. Oh, well, let's chalk that up to a subtle reminder, then. You wanna come in? Meet the gang? As a matter of fact, you know some of 'em. You put 'em here. Bunch of 'em would probably love to make you a personalized license plate. Send my regards for me. Mention how close we are, you and I. You're gonna check up on this Grim Reaper? That means goin' to Kinghorn's. Why don't you let me do that? If Kinghorn finds out you're not at the bottom of the river, he'll be more dangerous for you than any 10 gals in here... not to mention your daughter. [♪♪♪] I'll go to Kinghorn. [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] [BARKING] I'm home, Ma. [CHILDREN CHEERING] GIRLS [IN UNISON]: Birthday girl first. You first, Amanda. I'll get it. [♪♪♪] There's someone in there. There's someone watching me. You're just saying that because you missed it, but since it's your birthday, you can have another chance. No, there really was someone in there. Well, then let's go see. No, I think we should call my mom. I'll get it. [ROARS] [GIRLS SCREAM] [GIGGLES] You're such a dork, Amanda. Now watch how it's done. You watching, Amanda? She's over there. Amanda? Honey, are you okay? I was worried. Libby and Tracy said you thought someone was in the bushes. He was there, Mommy. He gave me these. Who, Amanda? Who gave you these? A man in the bushes? Who was he? I don't know. I didn't see him. Didn't you say Daddy gave me white roses on my birthday? Didn't you say he gave me one for each year? Yes. Yes, baby, I did. Yes. You ever found out what the hell happened with Ringerman? Well, he refuses to speak to anyone except his lawyer and the district attorney. [CHUCKLES] He's gonna deal, Pete. Why? It makes no sense. I mean, why the hell is he gonna do that? He was off. Good God in heaven, he was walking. We gave him every chance, even getting him with Judge Reasoner. Does he know the kind of maneuvering that took? Well, he doesn't seem to care. He just wants to make his deal and do his time. Wait, what are you doing? That's a $10,000 piece of pre-Columbian pottery. Well, whoever sold you this should be on the 10 most wanted. What about us? Hmm? What has Ringerman going to say about us? Nothin'. He won't say anything. There's no connection, and we did the right thing. He'll remember that. Now, what happened Friday night, the confession, I don't know if we'll ever know. And I don't care. I heard talk of Cain. Cain's dead. Did his name ever come up in connection with Ringerman? Maybe. Yeah. Maybe or yes? Which? Yes, I think so. I-- I don't know. That's all so vague. What are you worried about a dead man? 'Cause this wasn't the first time his name came up. What if he left something behind? What if he wrote something down? He didn't have anything towrite down. Cain was the damn toughest judge walkin' the earth. You think he would've settled for a couple of threats when he could've had us standin' before him in his own court? Eventually he would've turned up somethin', but he never had anything, anything concrete, while he was alive. There'll never be anything now that he's dead. He is dead? He is dead. And no matter what anybody dreams up or whispers in the streets, he's staying dead. All this talk, though, it's just so crazy, about the phantom judge with the face from hell. Yeah. What? The guy I had with me that night, he must've talked. You never told me you were there. I never told you anything. You never wanted to know. Like how we used acid... so everyone would think that it was a vendetta and not just a random homicide. [SIGHS] Oh, my God. You don't have the stomach for it, huh? Well, I don't have the stomach to send a man to his death, a man like Cain, unless I'm there to do it. [♪♪♪] [BEEPS] MacReady? MacReady, I'm looking at an open roof door in stairwell 2. MACREADY: We'll check it out pronto, Mr. Kinghorn. You do that, MacReady. Then decide what you're gonna say in your resignation if I have to do your job for you gain. Relax, Pete. Hmm? Whatever else we have to worry about, whatever or whoever is gonna take us to task, it's not gonna be a man named Cain. Magruder, you still on 7? MAGRUDER: In elevator 4, just comin' down. You told me to look in on Mr. Applegate's office next. Right. What about you, Harv? HARV: Okay here. Everything checks out. This is Gunderson. I'm just coming out of the men's room on 12. The roof door in stairwell 2, Gunderson. Looks like it's open. Check it out. The door is open. No sign of it being forced. Didn't we have this elevator serviced this morning? Maybe Morrissey didn't lock it up before he went to lunch. MACREADY: Heh, I'll worry about Morrissey. You look around. Ten-four. [♪♪♪] Nah, nobody up here but me and some pigeons. KINGHORN: What about the Reaper? The public is screaming for blood over these Grim Reaper murders, and it's not going to be mine. STRAUSS: What are you saying? It's gonna be mine? KINGHORN: I just don't wanna wind up on the news in another Ringerman fiasco. Do you have any kind of leads? Can you make up any? STRAUSS: I could, but we don't have to. I've got a suspect. KINGHORN: You do? Why wasn't I informed? STRAUSS: It just happened early this morning and I didn't wanna call in case you'd told Bonnie you were with me. The guy's an outpatient at a psychiatric hospital over in Highland Park. We got tipped to the guy by the director of the institute. KINGHORN: Jeez, a doctor rolling over on his own patient. Some ethics. STRAUSS: Yeah, you just can't trust anybody, can you, commissioner? Unlike two such above-reproach members of society like us. KINGHORN: Find your conscience on your own dollar. You get those charges filed. I'm going to be standing by tomorrow to make the announcement about the arrest. This city is going to see their government is effective, that we can get a lunatic like this off the streets. Do you think he's guilty? STRAUSS: Does it matter? KINGHORN: Get me an arrest. STRAUSS: Don't worry. No one's gonna take away your commissioner's hat. That's why we had to eliminate Cain, isn't it? [CAIN SCREAMING] [♪♪♪] Well, what's happening to me now? Why do I remember things that I feel are dreams but I know are not? I have some things here I want you to look at, Walter. Photographs. They're police photographs. Police? I just want you to look at them. Tell me how they make you feel, what they remind you of, if anything. They're not very pleasant. What? What's happening to me? What are these? What are they to you? My dreams. They're all my dreams... that aren't dreams. [SWITCH CLICKS] I'm convinced. I'm not. Well, this is a change of heart. I'm not saying I don't believe it's possible. I'm just saying I'm not convinced. I'm not sure what I am. I mean... I'm not even sure why I did this. This is a breach of every ethic I can think of. Doctor-patient confidentiality-- There is no doctor-patient confidentiality when the doctor's made aware a crime has been committed. All I have is a sick man who has dreams. They're not dreams, doctor. Dreams aren't real. See, this man has described to you every murder that's taken place. You don't even keep this type locked up. He gets to roam around, slips away when he wants and comes back in for his evening medication. That's pretty good. This type is just a man suffering from circumscribed amnesia brought on by severe trauma. Until a couple of days ago, he wasn't even staying here, Captain Strauss. He was being treated as an outpatient, just coming in for his therapy with Dr. Russell. She just admitted him the other night when-- Yeah, when he came in with blood on him. Yes. Yeah. It's too bad you run such an efficient hospital here. I would've liked to have analyzed that blood before your staff had washed it off Mr. Donovan. Does he remember the blood, doctor? Or can he conveniently forget that too with his, uh-- What is it? What kind of amnesia? Circumscribed amnesia. Partial amnesia that allows you to remember things from the past, but it's like dropping a wall at a certain point and not being able to remember from that moment to the present, like carving out one particular piece of your life. Yeah, like something traumatic and so bad that you don't want to remember it. Don't play psychiatrist with me, captain. And you don't play cop. [DONOVAN SIGHS] I... I have some others for you to look at. I don't need to see them. I know they're disturbing, but you should really see these others. I don't need to see them. [♪♪♪] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] They're the other two, aren't they? Yeah, the girl with the red hair and the seashells. She was wearing earrings with little seashells. And, uh... then there's the blond girl... in the yellow top. Yeah, a yellow top. Find a straitjacket with his initials on it, doctor. He's goin' to court. No one... No one can know that I... I allowed you to see this session. I... Sure, doctor. Don't worry. No one will ever know. [SOBS] TREMAYNE: Donovan may not be able to stand trial. He may not be well enough. That's a determination to be made by members of the medical profession. I'm just gonna charge him and let the system take over. Then what's bothering you, Captain Strauss? You look troubled. Haunted. Now, that's a bad choice of words, doctor. Let me ask you... is there any reason why I'm suddenly having the same dream over and over again? It's a dream I used to have a long time ago, ahem, and I'm suddenly-- Suddenly it's cropping up again. Well, it could mean many things. It could mean you can't hide from it anymore. Hide from what? Whatever it is about this nightmare that you want to forget. I didn't say it was a nightmare. A couple of officers will be here for Donovan in the morning. Good night, captain. Sleep well. Tanya, how's Mr. Donovan doing? I've just come to discuss that with you, Colin. Your secretary said you were with the police. They were here about Walter, weren't they? Yes. We were supposed to discuss this. Perhaps you should have a talk with Murch or Tucker? Perhaps they felt it was their civic obligation to contact the authorities. They came to me, despite your recommendation not to. I was only reminding them who Walter's doctor is, Colin. I hope you haven't forgotten that, either. Or that I'm also your sister. Oh, I haven't forgotten. And I hope you haven't forgotten who the director of this institute is. [♪♪♪] [DONOVAN SIGHS] Oh, seashells... Blond, yellow top. Her eyes... Her eyes... Her eyes... [GASPS] [GASPS] [PANTING] [CAIN SCREAMING] [TAKING SHUDDERING BREATHS] STRAUSS: Where'd you get that stuff? WES: The forensics lab. STRAUSS: Do I have to ask you if anybody knows what you needed it for? WES: No, I was in there when Levine was doing the Fishbein autopsy. When he went to the can, I filched it. [SIGHS] Amazing how this stuff won't do a thing to glass, but, man, what it'll do to metal, not to mention skin. [CAIN SCREAMING] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [CAIN SCREAMING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yeah? WES [ON PHONE]: Captain. Sorry about the hour, but I thought you'd wanna know. That bastard struck again. The Reaper. Where? When? We've got the time figured as about an hour ago, but... But there's more. I called Dr. Tremayne in the institute, right from the murder scene. Tremayne went to see his patient and, big surprise, our amnesia victim had slipped out and was just comin' in covered in blood, and it wasn't his own. All right. Good work, Wes. That's real good work. I'll be right down. I thought you'd wanna know right away. Sorry to wake you. That's okay. I've been sleeping too much lately anyway. First District Court is now in session, The People v. Walter Donovan. Mr. Donovan, do you realize what is taking place today? Yes. Yes, sir. This is not a trial. This is a hearing to determine whether or not you should be tried regarding the deaths of the six women with which you've been charged. Your Honor, as you can see, my client has been voluntarily under psychiatric care for the past two months. Since having a serious automobile accident, he has been experiencing a temporary memory lapse. In light of this medical situation, I would hope the court would understand he cannot hope to receive the proper medical expertise in a prison hospital. Very well. Give me a moment, please. I don't want you here. I don't want you to listen to this. I'll be okay, Walter. I'll be okay. Susie-- How's Susie? Where does she think I am? Has she seen anything? She just thinks you're in the hospital, that her Daddy is sick. I don't let her watch the news, and I kept her out of school this week. You can't keep her home from school the rest of her life. She won't have to worry about that. You'll be home soon. Mr. Underwood, what is your feeling regarding Mr. Donovan's medical history? Your Honor, I appreciate what defense counsel is saying, but we are talking about charges of multiple homicide in the first degree. The defendant cannot be released on bail. I appreciate that, Mr. Underwood, and under other circumstances, I would agree with you. But I do not want the defendant's health, mental or otherwise, unduly at risk. Mr. Newton, do you have a suggestion? Dr. Tremayne's institute, where my client currently resides, does have a security wing where I believe Mr. Donovan could be incarcerated and still be available for proper treatment. Very well, but I would hold one person responsible for Mr. Donovan's care. Perhaps his doctor of record? I've discussed that with Dr. Tremayne, and we both agreed that he should be that person. JUDGE: Are you comfortable with those arrangements, Mr. Donovan? Mr. Donovan, are you all right? Am I all right? I woke up with blood all over me, judge. That's enough, Walter. I don't know if I'm all right. Nobody knows if I'm all right. You don't need to say anything. I just need to know, because I remember killing them. I remember killing them, judge. I remember killing them. I remember killing them! I remember killing them! I remember killing them. I remember killing them! There's no doubt this guy's the Grim Reaper, judge, so let's boogie onto somethin' else. Somethin' we can really sink our teeth into. CAIN: Did you pull up that file I asked you for? You know, I'm not doing your taxes or running a daily planner here. You know, you got me accessing the police central mainframe. It takes a bit of genius and time. If I'm not careful, they'll lock on and trace us back. They trace hackers all the time. Now, that wouldn't do, would it? To have a knock on the old silo here, a couple of the old team in blue, their eyes lightin' up in surprise. "Hey, judge, what ya been up to this past year, besides terrorizing the ungodly and running around the subways?" I want everything not released to the public on the Grim Reaper murders. We ever get caught, certain people are just gonna kill you, but I'm gonna have to take my summers in Tibet. Read it and weep. CAIN: Get ready to saddle up, partner. We're ridin' into town tonight. What? I don't see anything. Nothin' I haven't read or seen on the tube. Exactly. There's only one way Donovan could have information about the murders that aren't on the file. Yeah, he's the murderer. Or the murderer gave them to him, maybe without Donovan's knowledge. That's supposing Donovan isn't the Reaper. Why should we suppose that? Because on the night the Hillman girl was murdered, Donovan had an alibi that satisfies me a thousand percent. Oh, I know this is gonna be good. I was with him in his room all night. [♪♪♪] Why? Why is Dr. Tremayne on my case? Why not you? Why-- Why aren't you my doctor any longer? TANYA: I don't know why Dr. Tremayne was put in charge of your case. [GASPS] Oh, my God! Who are you? What are you doing in my house? I'm here to talk to you about Walter Donovan. [SCOFFS] I don't understand. I don't know how you got in this house or-or how you got these tapes. From your office. Please don't do that. I know it's a panic button that signals a security system, but please don't press it. Not until you've heard what I have to say. I believe that together we can convince the court of Donovan's innocence. How do you know of any of this? Who are you? God, what are you? You told the DA that even though Donovan had knowledge of the Grim Reaper murders, facts that only the murderer could know, you were not convinced of his guilt. How do you know what I said to the DA? Did you break into their office in the middle of the night too? I know things. Such as someone else told the police of Donovan's confessions. Someone else who had access to his medical files and tapes, someone else who could alter the medication prescribed by you. The medication? No, no one can do that. No one can change anything that I've prescribed except maybe-- Dr. Tremayne? Dr. Tremayne is one of the finest doctors in this country. I don't believe he would betray a patient like that. He's the one that fed Donovan to the police, maybe to cover up for somebody else. Check the institute. Find out if Tremayne changed Donovan's medication. This is preposterous. Some lunatic in a black coat and a hat comes riding in like Zorro, and I'm supposed to do what you ask? Surely doctors of psychiatry are not supposed to use words like "lunatic." In instances like this, they do. Why? [SCOFFS] Why should I listen to you? Because you're the member of a profession that deals in learning the truth. I can show you the truth. All right. I'll go to the office. But I can't-- [♪♪♪] Damn! Oh, I don't know, Kemosabe. There's a lot of microwave activity out here. A lot of satellite dishes from that broadcasting station we passed comin' up South Street. I'm gettin' jammed out the wazoo. Keep at it. I want everything in the institute's computer on Walter Donovan's treatments. I'll phone if I get work. Wait a minute. You really believe this Donovan is getting more than Thorazine treatments? I slipped into his room as soon as he was brought there that night. I stayed until 4 a.m. The police file you pulled said that Cindy Hillman was murdered at 3 a.m. So however Walter Donovan got soaked in blood... Blood, mind you, that matched that of the Hillman girl. ...it happened after the fact by somebody else that was at the murder scene. It's too bad there's already a Wizard of Oz, judge, or your next career'd be a lock. If I'm not home by midnight, call the president. No problem. His number's in the auto dialer. He said he'd come back. He said-- He said he'd come back. Come on, Walter. Down the hatch. Do what she says, Mr. D. We're all buddies here. And I know it's not you two, but there's one orderly that's decided he can leave things laying about without putting them away. Scully told me this morning. I don't know who it is, unless it's that new guy, Deacon. Well, have a talk with him. I'll have a talk with him. You behave, or I'll have to have a talk with you. You did as I said. You've been avoiding taking your drugs. Good. I didn't think you were coming back. I... I started to think there was no one to be coming back. I thought this was part of what's wrong with me. I can't speak to your amnesia, but part of what's wrong with you is these. You know, in the past few years, they've made interesting discoveries in the relationship between blood chemistry and mental disorders. You've been receiving a dangerous dosage of a complex chemical compound which can, in a normal human being, temporarily duplicate all of the mental and physical sensory symptoms of a violent schizophrenic. My God. They've been making me into a monster? No, they just made it appear that way. You haven't killed anyone, at least not to my knowledge. But I see them. I see the women screaming and dying. I see them. Someone is making you see them. Is someone making me see the blood from one of the victims? How does it get there if I didn't--? Not how. The question is who. Who is putting it there? And the answer is the Reaper, the true Reaper. You have no idea how much I want to believe you. How much I needto believe you. My little girl. She's only 5. That's all I think about. Even my wife, I mean, it kills me not to be with her, but my baby needs me. Who'll take care of her? Who'll watch out for her? I missed the father/daughter dance last night. All the daddies with their little girls... and I couldn't be there for her. I missed it. You haven't told anyone about my visit the other night, have you? Anyone? No. No. Not that I know of. How do you get in here? As Houdini once postulated, certain places are made not to be broken into. That's why he always insisted on being locked inside a safe. These rooms were designed not to be broken out of. They're easy to get into from the corridor. But then how do you get out? Sleight of hand. What do I do? Just what you've been doing. You wait to hear from me and you avoid taking that medication as best you can. We're going to need hard evidence and someone on your side. You're on my side. Someone real on your side, someone who can stand up for you in court. [BEEPING] [LATCH CLICKS] It's all in the touch. Wait. Why? Why do you do this? Why do you do this the way you do it? Because they make me. [♪♪♪] Yes, Tina. Tanya. No, I came to the office. Do you have that information I called you about? He did? When? [SIGHS] No. No, no, no, he-- He did clear it with me. I just... Thank you. Tremayne did change the medication. [SIGHS] I didn't even... [SIGHS] I didn't even hear you at all. I didn't know when I'd see you again... or if I even would. I, uh... [SCOFFS] This whole thing is-- Crazy? [SCOFFS] Psychiatrists don't use words like that. Look, what do I do? How do I handle this? I have to call the police. First, you need something definitive to take to them. When you have it, go to District Attorney Dan Underwood. He'll know what to do, and you can trust him. What an odd thing to say. Do you work with him? Does he know you? No one knows me. You don't seem like a man who has to hide. Why do you? Bring Tremayne here. Why? What are you gonna do to him? Talk to him. DONOVAN [ON RECORDING]: I can see the blood. The blood on the clothing, the blood on the... I can't hear her scream. No, I can't hear her screaming, but I know she does. I... I don't know why I can't see her face clearly enough. I... I-- I never see their faces. I must block them out. It's like I can see them. I... Long, pretty, yellow hair. Earrings with... little seashells. [SCREAMS] Pretty girls. [SCREAMS] Such pretty girls, but I... [SCREAMING] I can't see their faces. Colin! It's like... I can see what's happening in... In quick images, like I'm walking through an old movie. Colin. Colin! Damn it! Col-- I need to go out. No! No, not tonight. Not with Donovan locked up in the security wing. Then they'll know he can't have been the Reaper. I have to. Dear God, you fight me every step of the way. Colin, how can I help you hide what you are if you won't let me? I don't think I can do this anymore. You're getting worse. No. No, I can be good. I can. [SIGHS] Help me. Help me and I can stop. [SIGHS] Tanya... Tanya, you always took care of it all. I just thought if I could... give the police something, someone... Then Walter gets locked up. And two weeks later when another girl is dead and they know they have the wrong man, where will they look? [♪♪♪] I can stop. I can. I can stop. I can. Like you did the last time? Or the time before that? Or the time before that?! I am the institute. Without me, there is no institute. Without me... there is nothing. Nothing for you. I'll help you, Colin. I promised you. I'll help you... but you must listen to me. You must do as I say. You can't hide any more of these recordings from me. They all have to be erased. All. Let me speak to Murch. Murch, Dr. Russell. There's someone in my office. [GROANS SOFTLY] Damn. Donovan. Walter. Walter, come on. Walter! Walt, come on, I've gotta get you out of here. Walter! [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Everything's gonna be okay now, Colin. Everything's gonna be okay. Fifteen cc's. Fifteen? Oh! We're gonna find out exactly who this is. Put it back on him. Put it back on him. Ugh! [♪♪♪] [GROANS] [BREATHING RAPIDLY] CAIN: From the grave, Strauss. I'll get you... you and Kinghorn. From grave... Strauss. Strauss... Shouldn't be more than another hour. Keep her up if you can. I've got someone here who wants to sleep over with her tonight. I think it's the one she wanted. No matter. If she doesn't want it, it can sleep with me. Heh, no. No, no, it's nothing. It's just a business meeting. Yeah, yeah, it has to do with Kinghorn. Karen, it's nothing to worry about. I'll be home before you know it. Make sure Amanda waits up for me. Love you. [BEEPS] [GASPING] You're mad, Strauss. You and Kinghorn. You think you can scare me off? No, judge, I surely don't. But that's what Kinghorn wanted to try. We figured the most important things in your life are your wife and baby girl. Now, Kinghorn figured we'd take one from you, yeah? We'd kill one, maybe you'd stay in line so you didn't lose the other. It's not a bad plan, but this is simpler. I'll get you, Strauss. You and that bastard masquerading as a police commissioner. I'll get you-- From the grave. If that's what it takes. You'll get swallowed, even if for my murder. Anyway, that would be me getting you even from the grave. Now, you talk nasty like that to me, judge, and I may go visit your wife and kid tonight, even while you're taking your first harp lesson. I may go see them and arrange a family reunion. [TIRES SCREECHING] [SCREAMING] Come on, we gotta stop him. WES: We don't need to stop him anymore. [♪♪♪] [GASPING] Take it easy, man. We'll get you home. [CAIN GROANING SOFTLY] Judge! God, Judge, it's you! Oh... Oh. Oh! Oh, God. Judge, oh... [GROANS, THEN CHUCKLES SOFTLY] From the grave, Strauss. [MAN SPEAKING IN CHINESE] Oh, please, Grandpa, can give me a chance, huh? [SPEAKS IN CHINESE] [IN ENGLISH] Grandfather is right. Why did you bring him here? Why not to the police? CAIN: No, no... N-n-no... No... That's why. He doesn't want the police. He's in shock. He doesn't know what he wants or needs. I cannot do for him here what he requires. You must take him to the clinic. As far as I know, the police did this. I was meeting him because he had me diggin' up files on-- It's better you don't know. This appears to be some kind of carbolic acid. There's probably been nerve damage. He's going to lose the hand. Whatever it takes, you have to do it, Lee. I owe this guy. He's the judge. He's the reason I'm not in there with the hard-timers and scuzzbuckets. He's the one who gave me the chance. I'm asking you, as my brother, you have to do what it takes, Lee. I'll do whatever you need. If he dies? [SCOFFS] Well, if he dies, I'm in deep anyway. Who'll believe a convict out on furlough with a dead judge on her hands? Lee, the guy trusted me. A judge trusted a convict to dig up files on the police. I turn him in, he could be a lot worse than what you see here. Rae, with what exists in medicine today, you have no idea how much I could help him if he goes to a trauma center. We keep him here, even with everything I could do... Look, when this man realizes what he will be... he may hate us. No... No police. No... He may hate himself. He'll be alive, won't he? [SHEARS CUTTING] No... N-n-no police. No-- Strauss... S-s-s-strauss... Captain, glad I was able to find you. You're not going to believe what I have to tell you. What? [♪♪♪] Tremayne... Tremayne. Colin. COLIN: You'd better come now. Colin. I gotta go. You better hang up. You'd better come here and hear what else he has to say. CAIN: No... No. No, not Donovan. Tremayne. Tremayne is the Reaper. Tremayne killed them. Tremayne killed them. [♪♪♪] [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [TIRES SCREECH] Did you locate Commissioner Kinghorn yet? WES: No, captain. I left word at his home and his office. Keep trying. Call both girlfriends if you have to, but find him. Take care of the other matter and get here. Already made the stop and I'm on my way. And I left word for the commissioner you have something he'll really wanna hear. No, it's not something he wants to hear. It's not something he wants to hear at all. What am I doin'? No one can see in. Captain Strauss. I'm supposed to meet Dr. Tremayne in OR 1. I'll show you the way. Just tell me. I'll find it. Captain Strauss, I'm Dr. Russell. Dr. Tremayne asked me to meet you. All right, let's go. I'm expecting someone. Just send him up. [GEARS WHIR] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Hey, where are you going? Oh, uh, did Captain Strauss come this way? Yeah, he said you'd be along. Oh, he did? He told me to send you on down. Up the corridor to the left. Operating Room One. Nothin' like a little police cooperation, right? [GROANS] [YELLING] Look, I wanna see Tremayne now, okay? He'll be right with us. He said to meet him in OR 1. Is that where Cain is? [YELLING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [GROANING] Tremayne? Dr. Tremayne? Colin? Cain? [GASPS] It's me, Cain. The one you want, isn't it? Come on, let's end this nightmare, Cain. You've been haunting me for almost a year now. Come on. [SOBBING] I tried for you, Colin. I tried. I'm tired of ghosts and goblins, Cain. I'm tired of dead men, Cain. Aren't you tired of being one? [MUFFLED SCREAMING] Remember that family reunion I promised you? [AMANDA WHIMPERING] Well, today's the day. Don't you wanna say hi to your daughter and goodbye once more, huh? Talk to your daddy. Tell your daddy to come out. Come on. Come on. Go on. He told you to call your dad. My-- My daddy's dead. Well, how right you are. Your last chance to look, Cain! [AMANDA WHIMPERING] [♪♪♪] Stop fighting, you little-- All right, take it easy. Now you just watch the door. This is an operating room. An emergency generator should kick on. [WHIRRING] [WHIMPERING] Now, keep that kid still. [♪♪♪] [MUFFLED GROANING] Wes? CAIN: I told you I'd come back for you, Strauss, from the grave, if necessary. [GUNSHOT] Face me. Face me, damn you! You want me, you got me. Why don't you stand up and face me? You wanted me?[GASPS] You've got me. [GASPS] [♪♪♪] [HISSING] Watch her die, Cain! Cain! [SCREAMING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh! AMANDA: No, no. Are you okay? You okay? No, no, no. Oh, no, I'm a friend. [SOBBING] Oh, I knew your father. Oh! Oh... Are you okay? Now that that monster's gone away. Let's go home. [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Anything I say... Anything I try to say will sound inane. I know that you can never understand what you've done for me. Just this morning... I mean, just this morning I thought my life as I knew it was over. Looking across at my home, knowing Susie and Lisa are waiting for me, that I'm gonna walk through that door like I have so many other times... I feel reborn. When I truly lost all hope, you've given me a second chance at life. What can I do to thank you for that? Use it. How will I find you again? How do I contact you? What if I need you? You won't need me, Walter. You won't need me. And if you do, I'll be listening. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Thanks. Someone's waiting for you. Daddy! Daddy's home! [♪♪♪] There is still much to be unraveled in this truly bizarre turn of events connected with the Grim Reaper murders, but it is suspected that the man who kidnapped Amanda Cain, daughter of the late Judge Paul Cain, was indeed a city police officer named Kevin Wesley. Wesley died tonight in the fire at the Broadmoor Institute, along with Captain Strauss, Dr. Colin Tremayne and Dr. Tanya Russell. There are unsubstantiated rumors that Dr. Tremayne is going to be named in connection with the Reaper murders along with his sister, Dr. Tanya Russell, who also worked at the institute. It is believed they conspired together to have one of their patients, Walter Donovan, convicted of the heinous Reaper crime. I-- I have no idea what happened or why. I-- I was out for the evening and someone came to the babysitter and identified themselves as a police officer and took my daughter, and... Oh! Why Amanda Cain was taken from her home tonight is a complete mystery. Why did that man say I was gonna meet Daddy? For a minute he made me think Daddy wasalive. I can't explain why people do such cruel things, honey. They're sick people. They need help. And sometimes innocent people get hurt by their illness. But you don't have anything to worry about. I'm here, and I love you. Will you stay with me for a while? I'm afraid. Afraid of the monster. Oh, sure, baby. I'm just gonna make sure the door's locked, okay? I'll be right back. But what if the monster comes back? Oh, honey, mmm! He won't. I'll be one minute. Here, while I'm gone, you hold this. You don't have anything to worry about. What do I always tell you? Daddy watches over us. And Daddy will protect you from the monster, okay? Mmm. You'll protect me from the monster, Daddy. You'll protect me. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
