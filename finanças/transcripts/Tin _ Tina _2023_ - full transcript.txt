THEOPHANY (FROM ANCIENT GREEK THEOPHÁNEIA) NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL MANIFESTATION OF GOD Lord, you that look at us from your throne in Heaven and heed our prayers with benevolence. Adolfo, do you take María de los Dolores as your lawfully wedded wife and promise to be faithful to her for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish her, until death do you part? I do. María de los Dolores, do you take Adolfo as your lawfully wedded husband and promise to be faithful to him for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish him, until death do you part? I do. May the Lord in his kindness strengthen the consent you have declared before the Church and bring to fulfillment his blessings within you. What God has joined, let no one put asunder. Amen. Amen. You may kiss the bride. SPAIN 1981 Are you ready? Well, are the three of you ready? We are. - Here. - Thank you. I think I've got it. Luis and Marta. Um, that's too common. Common? Okay. Eustaquio and Candelaria. That's horrible. I like names that symbolize something. That symbolize something? Hmm. What about Adam and Eve then? Don't be silly. You're gonna be the best mom in the world. Long live the newlyweds! Careful! Careful! Oh! Watch out! Be careful! What's wrong? Don't move! Silence! Silence! Yesterday, at 6:26 in the evening, took place the most dramatic episode in the history of our country, since the beginning of democracy. Adolfo, what happened? There were some complications. I'm really sorry. No. No. I must inform you that you suffered internal damage. Quite severe. What? I'm afraid you'll never be able to bear children. Oh, no! No! No! I'm really sorry. Why me? - Hey. - Why me? Hey. Through my fault. Through my fault. Through my most grievous fault. Amen. Lola, you look like a ghost. Look at you. It's been six months already. I need you to be well. I'm willing to do anything for you. Anything. - Why don't we go back to our town? - No, that's out of the question. - But this house... - The house isn't the problem here. I had a wonderful childhood in this house. And our children will be happy here too. Honey. There's a convent nearby. It's an orphanage. There are children there. - Maybe we could go... - Mm-mm. We'll love them as if they were our very own. - No. No. - Listen, honey. One nail drives out another. Please go. Lola... I can't go on like this. I just can't. TVE PRESENTS EVERY THURSDAY FROM 7 TO 8 This country is out of control. Young people these days lack essential values. They're completely lost. Reverend Mother. Are you all right? Mm. My wife grew up in a convent. Mm? This sacred place was built in the 15th century after the birth of Christ. You could say that our lifestyle and doctrine are definitely old-school. Here we provide shelter and education to abandoned children. Children from unwed mothers... ...prostitutes, children with physical disabilities, with mental impairments. Yeah. We were looking to adopt preferably two babies, but... Without impairments, of course. In that case, I'd ask for your donation to the convent to be quite generous. How long for the paperwork to be processed? Mmm. That'll be sorted out as soon as we receive your donation. I have it here. Hmm. Where is your wife? Heavenly music, don't you think? They play like angels. And they're only seven years old. - This is being played by children? - Honey, everything's been taken care of. I'd like to meet them. Tin, Tina! Come here, please! They were abandoned at the gates of the convent. They were just a few weeks old. They are... unique, special children. Sure. But Tin and Tina, these aren't Spanish names, are they? No. They were named after Saint Augustine, patron saint of our order. Children. This is Mr. Adolfo and, uh... his wife. Lola. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. You play the organ beautifully. We practice every day. The wrath of God! It's the wrath of God! It's just a storm, don't worry. Lola. We need to focus, okay? Children, you can go back to playing. Don't go away, please. Stay. Yes, please, don't go. Stay here with us. We can play lots of other things, you know. I would love to. But I can't. Tin, come on, don't be sad. I told you that nobody loves us. Just a second. Lola, no, no, no, please listen. I know what you're thinking, and they're just too old. And a bit strange. These children need to be loved, Adolfo. Same as us, we need love. So let's give each other love. Let us be a family. Are you sure about them? Don't you like the music? That music is satanic. Oh, well then... Why don't you sing us a song then? Yes, let's sing a song! Okay, what song shall we sing? Come on, I'm sure you know many songs. Mm-hmm. That's very, very nice, you two. That's a very nice song. How is my boy? Children. This is Kuki. You want to say hello? - Whoa! - Tina! Tina! - Kuki. - What's wrong? You afraid? Kuki, stop! Come on. He's a very good dog. His name is Kuki, and you'll have to help us take care of him. That's enough. It's all right. Look! Daddy pilots one of those. Really? - Yeah. - So cool! Up in the sky, have you seen God? Haven't had the pleasure of meeting him yet. The drive didn't take long. Not at all. The convent is very close. How close is it? About 15 kilometers away. And on foot? Uh, on foot? Through the woods, it would be, uh... six kilometers. But it would take a long time. Why do you want to know? Mm. Come on. Wow! So cool! It's so cool. Totally. - Let's explore the house. - Okay! You'd think there was a dead body in here. Honey. It's been so long since I've seen you smile. Children. Children. Children. Children! What's wrong, Mommy? Nothing. Mommy, did we do something wrong? No. It's just that this room isn't yours. It's the one down the hall. Come on, Tina! Let's go see it! And those ones? Are they from another plane trip? Those are from China, a country far away. - If you want, I can show you pictures. - And that? Is it from another trip? No, this is a, uh, a TV. You've never seen one? Mm-mm. Okay. Dinner's ready. All right. Where are you going? - Let's see how it turned out. - I'm sure it'll be great. Let's see. Tin and I wanted to thank you for adopting us as your children. Close your eyes, please. Okay. Open them. This is the crown of Christ, so that you may free us from the curse of sin. Thank you. It's nice. Now you, Mommy. I want you to close your eyes. All right. Let me put this on. Now. This is the Holy Rosary, so that you, like Mary, can meditate about the mysteries of our faith. If you wear it, it'll protect you from evil. Come on, the king is hungry. Honey, I've seriously missed your omelets. Come on, it'll get cold. What's wrong? Why aren't you eating? Well, you didn't say grace. How could I forget? Come on. Let's all say grace, all right? Oh Lord, we give you thanks for this day and for this food we are about to eat. May it serve to fulfill your will. In the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. All right. Let's dig in. Mmm. This is delicious. Mommy? Yes? Why did you adopt us? Because we wanted to. Yes, but... why don't you have children of your own? Because it's impossible. Everything's possible, Mommy. Miracles happen every day. Why did you bring all this? So that the, uh, the exterminating angel can't come into this house. Exterminating angel? Good morning, Mommy. Good morning, Mommy. Good morning. You can sit down. Shouldn't we wait for Daddy? No, Dad woke up very early to get to work. Come on, let's have breakfast. You don't say grace before breakfast? No, I'm not going to say grace. You don't believe in God, right? Sometimes it's hard to believe. "The fool says in his heart, 'Liar, there is no God.'" I know that one. Psalm, uh... seven? - It's Psalm 14, silly. - Aw, nuts. You know, we have a way of seeing God. You want to know how? Sure. But you have to promise that no matter what happens, you won't get up from your chair. Do you promise? Yes, I promise. I really want to see God. I'd like to ask him something. Please, pretty please. Okay. Tina, what are you doing? Psst. You promised. Are you okay? I asked for a miracle for you. I'm sure He will grant it. "Let us all seek God. Have faith and no doubt." "If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." I know that one. Matthew ten... - Food fight! - Guys, you can't do that! Gotcha! Take that! Who did that? EL POZÓN SCHOOL As you can see, inside the rib cage we can find the two lungs which contract and expand every time we breathe. And if we remove them, we discover the most important organ in the human body... The schlong! Kids. Hey, kids, kids, please! Pedro. Hey, listen to me. One more stupid joke, you're out. Got it, Mr. Julián. No more jokes, I promise. Good morning, Mr. Julián. Good morning. Good morning. Come on in. Hey, everybody, that's enough. Please be quiet. We have two new students joining us today. Now, this is Tin and this here is Tina. Hey, I know those two. You're the children of Count Dracula! Pedro! Hey! Everybody, quiet! THE HOLY TRINITY "Ezekiel, Prophecy against Philistia 25:16." You're very good at this, Mommy. Here, you try. But be careful. Here. "I will carry out great vengeance and punish them in my wrath." "Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I take vengeance on them." You're really good at this. Mommy, are we the children of Dracula? You know who Dracula is? Why aren't we like everyone else? Why did God make us so strange? You want me to show you a secret? Okay. Mm-hmm. Part of your leg is fake? Uh-huh. See, I'm strange too. What happened to you? When I was your age... my parents used to go from town to town, and they would show movies. We lived in a camper van. One night, I woke up, and my leg was on fire. There was fire everywhere. I was able to escape, save myself. But my parents didn't. It was God, Mommy. God saved you. - Is anyone home? - Daddy! Did you nail all those crucifixes over the doors? I thought that was you. - It was the children. - So what? Who cares? If it matters to them, just leave them be. They're totally obsessed with religion. - They spend all day talking about God. - That's normal. They were raised by nuns. It'd be weird if they were into football. True. Do you believe God exists? Seriously? I think that there are two options. Either we believe there's a... an omnipotent and mysterious God and that you and I will be reunited in our next life, or... Or God doesn't exist. And we made all that up so we wouldn't feel so alone. And nothing makes sense. And that's why I think... we shouldn't leave to the next life what we can enjoy in this one. Hey, stop! The kids might see us! You're starting to sound a lot like a mother. You're an idiot. I said it was going to happen, didn't I? Hey, what's going on? Why aren't you asleep? We don't feel sleepy. Can we play battle of the angels? Yes, let's play battle of the angels and then we'll go to sleep. Please. Pretty please. Fine. How do you play it? It's very easy. You close your eyes, and then we recite a verse from the Bible. - Mm-hmm. - When we're finished, you count to three. You open your eyes and look for us. That's it? What do I have to do? Get up on your feet. Revelation, chapter 12, verses seven and nine. "And there was a war in Heaven." "Michael and his angels fought against the great dragon." "The great dragon, that serpent most ancient, also known as the Devil and Lucifer, the one who leads the whole world astray." Ready? One... ...two... And three! Be gone, Satan! This is our Heaven! Get out! Children, is this another game? Where are you? Hey, where did you go? Come on, Tin, hold on tight! Mom, ask him something! Let go! I told you to hold tight! Mommy, you can almost see him! There he is! There he is! Feel better? Yes. Lola, a proper punishment will put a stop to this nonsense once and for all. They're just kids. They like to play, like all kids do. They just need some time to adjust, that's all. Tin and Tina! Shhh. It's okay. We're really sorry, Mom. If we've done something bad to you, we deserve to be punished. Kuki! Enough! In the convent, they used to beat us with sticks. And one time, we committed a very big sin, and they cut off our hair. Shhh. Without punishment, there's no salvation. We're not going to punish you, all right? Kuki! Are you okay, Mommy? You take a few steps back, and when you let go, you have to put your feet up. Like this. See? Come on, it's super easy. Don't be such a chicken. I'm not a chicken. Well, do it, then. Well, well! If it isn't the little Draculas! Wow! Nice hats you've got there. I bet they match the coffins you sleep in very well. We don't sleep in coffins. That's a lie. Are you sure? Mm. Mm. What are you doing? Wait, no! What... What are you doing? No! No! - No, please! No! - Hey, don't do that! - No! - Let go of me! - Fly, Dracula! - Stop! - Higher! - No, stop it! - Fly! - Stop! Stop! MY FAVORITE HORRORS Shh. ...he used to drink the blood of his victims. That's why... Shh. ...people started calling him "Draculis," which means dragon or devil, or more specifically, son of the Devil. - Daddy. - Yes, that's me. - Can we watch the movie, please? - No. We can't, it's a scary movie. What do you mean, you can't? - Of course you can. Right, hon? - Really? - It's just that we're both very tired. - You sure? - So we're going to bed now. - Yes, very. Have fun, you two. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. From that, Bram Stoker created Dracula... - Cool, isn't it? - Mm. ...still popular today. Turn down the volume, please. Rock, paper, scissors. All right, your turn. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Should I give him more? - Yes. That'll make him sleep better. Your turn. Hurry up, Tin! They'll see us! Scaredy-cat. Here you go, boy. Here's some yummy food. I can't. A little bit more. Right here. Come on, Tin. We don't have very much time. Mmm... This one. That's too small. Let's take... this one. But I like this one more. You take this one. And... and take this thing also. Did you do it yet? No, I'm scared. Look. You have to do it right... here. But I can't. Do it hard, Tin, hard. You've got blood all over your face. You look like a vampire. And you... you look like a circus clown. Take that. You'll see. Come on, Tin. Stop it. Here, I'll help you. It's like cutting up a steak. Like this. Now stick your hand in and pull it out. What's it like? It's... squishy. Like a sponge? No. Squishy... like a snail. Like a snail? You're such a ninny. Psalm 51, verses one and two. "Have mercy on me, O God... ...according to your unfailing love, according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions." "Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin." Put it back in. Careful. - You're good at sewing. - Thank you. You'll see. Mommy will be so happy when she wakes up. All done. Now we just have to wait. Waiting is so boring. What will we do until she wakes up? We can... do like everybody else, watch TV. People don't believe in anything these days. They don't even believe in illusionists. Well, I'll give you some time to think about that statement. And we'll be back shortly. - What's wrong, honey? - Oh, nothing. Nothing. It's just the kids. They've been playing with the jam again. Honey, that's not jam. Kuki's not waking up. Mm. What have you done? Kuki behaved very badly with Mommy. And so we washed him. What do you mean, you washed him? We cleansed his soul. We washed away his sins. We wanted to honor you, Mommy. We wanted you to be proud of us. Why isn't he waking up? Because he's dead. Dead? Is it our fault? Did we kill him? No! No! No! No! No! No! No! It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. It was an accident. God, it stinks. You feeling any better? What if they decide to cut you or me open to cleanse our souls? Lola. It was a misunderstanding. A tragic one, but one nonetheless. These children see life in a more innocent way. And you know what they need? A mother who can teach them the difference between what's right and what's wrong. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Tin! Tin, what's wrong? Are you all right? What's going on? The fire... The eternal fire. What is this? I don't want any more penance in this house. Is that clear? Mommy, if we pray a lot, will Kuki be resurrected? No, he won't be resurrected. - But the Bible says... - Enough! Listen to me. This is very important. You can't just do whatever the Bible says you should. Why not? It's the word of God. Yes, but it can't be taken literally, word for word. You've read some stories at school, haven't you? Mm-hmm. Tales about witches and wizards, stories of fairy godmothers, tales of talking wolves and pigs. But animals don't speak. Of course they don't speak. Because it's fantasy. It's an imaginary world that doesn't exist. The Bible is fantasy. There are no such things as angels and demons or Heaven and Hell. I think they do exist. I think so as well. And you, you will believe too someday. What are you laughing about? Daddy! Come here. Hey. Do you know who I saw from the plane on Christmas Eve? Uh, God? No. It was Santa Claus. With his sleigh and reindeers. You know what he said to me? "Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, Adolfo!" "I have here in my sleigh something for your children." Huh? Wow! This is so cool! He also gave me this. ENRIQUE AND ANA CHINESE SPINNING PLATE "Super spinning disks." Almost didn't make it because of the snow. I have a lot to do. - Hmm? - Mm. You okay? Yes. - I'm going to go get changed. - All right. This song is one of the top hits of 1981. I'm sure you all know what song I'm talking about, right? Are you ready? Let's dance. Oh, you're tired. How much longer till midnight? It won't be long now. Look. When both hands on the clock are here, it's midnight. Hmm. Seven, eight, nine... Mommy, the coffee's ready. Ten, eleven, and twelve. All done. What do I do now? You can, uh, sprinkle sugar on the cake if you want. It's in the cupboard. - No, not that! - What's wrong, Mommy? That's for killing bugs. What is that doing here? This is the sugar. Our cameras are bringing you these... I've got the grapes! That's great, sweetie. Thank you. You're welcome. You remember what I said? No. What do you mean, no? What about you? - No. - You don't either? The coffee's ready. Great. Make some room for Mom. Let's go over it. First, the ball goes down. - I remember that. - It goes down. That's when it starts. That's our cue. And you take a grape. Yes, I know. - And every time the bell rings... - One grape! - You got it. Very good. - Whoo! Mommy? - Lola! - Mommy? Lola! Lola! EMERGENCY María de los Dolores? I just received the results of your tests. You've had your New Year's Eve interrupted for a good reason. I don't understand. You're going to have a baby. But that's impossible. Consider it a miracle. Happy New Year. A great magician from the East, Kin Khan Kun the soothsayer, showed me his secret, the super Chinese spinning plate. Very good. You did that very well. Did you like it, Mommy? Yes, very much. And our little brother? Hang on a second. He absolutely loved it. Go on, off to bed. You need to rest up for tomorrow. You believe in God now, right? What makes you say that? Well, because our baby brother is going to be born, thanks to a miracle. It's true. I asked Him for it, and He made it happen. There are no such things as miracles. Everything in life can be explained. - You have eyes, but you don't see. - What don't I see? When Jesus was born, his mother, the Virgin Mary, suffered a lot because she already knew that her son would have to die to save us all. A sacrifice. And what if God wants to sacrifice our baby brother to save us? That'd be a shame. I don't want him to die. Right, Mommy? Hello, Draculas. Are you guys nervous? Today, you'll be receiving the body of Christ. Although I'm pretty sure you two would much prefer to receive the blessing of the Holy Ghost! It's blasphemy, Tina! He said the unforgivable! Don't worry, Tin. Don't you worry. God will deliver justice. I don't see the children. Many thanks to the children in the choir. And also, to our young friends, Tin and Tina, who have accompanied us on the organ. Take this and eat it. This is the body of Christ, which will grant you eternal life. Amen. Take this and eat it. This is the body of Christ, which will grant you eternal life. Amen. Take this and eat it. This is the body of Christ, which will grant you eternal life. Amen. Take this and eat it. This is the body of Christ, which will grant you eternal life. Amen. Let's go, come on. We have to do this. Let's go together. Come on. Good night, Mommy. Good night. Was that the boy that bullies you at school? He calls us Draculas. Do you have anything to do with what happened to him? You mustn't lie to me. Lying is a sin. You don't have to worry, Mommy. We'll pray really hard for him. You two go to bed now. Pedro. Pedro... Hello? Hello. The school gave me your number. I'm sorry to bother you. You're not bothering me. You were there for the First Communions the other day, weren't you? Yes. I'm Pedro's mother. The boy who had the accident. How is he doing? Bad. He's in a coma. My God, I'm so sorry. Some of the children have said that during the procession, they saw my Pedro lagging behind with your children, and... - But the police said that... - Yeah. Yeah, the police said he slipped and... and fell down the rocks. But I don't know. I have a feeling that that's not what happened. I know my son is not a saint and that he picked on your kids. And I can understand that they would want to... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you. You can't imagine how hard it is to think that at any moment your son could die. Mommy. Who's on the phone? No one. SPARE THE ROD, SPOIL THE CHILD Lola. Lola. Well? This may sound strange to you. But I really need to know... if Tin and Tina ever got involved in any kind of trouble with other children. No, never. Have they done something wrong? I'm not sure. But they may have made a mistake with terrible consequences. Do you have any evidence to make you suspect them? Are you quite sure that they never did anything violent? Perhaps some misinterpretation of the Bible? John 10:14. "I am the good shepherd." "I care for my sheep." "And without any hesitation, I lay down my life for every one of them." Perhaps your way of leading the flock is not the most appropriate way. "Spare the rod and spoil the child." Suffering is necessary. Nobody can seek Christ without suffering the pain of carrying his cross. I'm just saying that Tin and Tina... Tin and Tina are two beings of the light. Mischievous, like all children, but they are pure, righteous, and kind. It is not they who are the problem. It is you. You judge them without knowing. And that is a sin. You really shouldn't imagine things. - I shouldn't have come here. - Wrong. God has brought you here today for a good reason. Where is God when babies are allowed to die without having the chance to live? Where is He? God is right here. Absence is presence. That is the great mystery. I'm sorry. The dark night of the soul. You are absorbed by the darkness. You must seek. Never cease to seek. Only then will you find the light. The wrath. MATTHEW 12 The wrath of God. How was the flight? The flight? Fine, as usual. Wha... What are you doing still up? You smell of alcohol. Yeah, I had a few drinks with the guys. I'm going to bed now, hon. I'm very tired. Can you come here a second? Lola, it's four in the morning. What do you want? Could you please come down here for a moment? Yes, of course. What's wrong? The boy from the Communion is in a coma. I think Tin and Tina are responsible and that they're playing this horrendous game. I found these. And I think we should go to the police. It's evidence. Let me see. For God's sake, Lola, they're just drawings. That boy was bullying them. It's normal that they'd do things like this or even worse. And what if they're not simply innocent children who misinterpret the Bible? What if they're just the opposite? What if they use the Bible to justify their evil actions? This is all because of the dog, right? Won't you ever forgive them? A mother should trust her children and protect them. That's what I'm doing. Protecting the child I'm carrying. This is total nonsense. When that boy comes out of the coma, he'll explain what happened. And now, I'm going to bed. Tina! Tina! Tina, wake up! What is it, Tin? The Bible! It's gone! Tin! The crucifixes! Mommy! Mommy! The exterminating angel has taken away all the crucifixes! And he's stolen our...! When you both are older, you may open this box. But until then, there will be no more religion in this house. And if for any reason you ever break this rule, you will go back to the convent immediately. Have I made myself absolutely clear? Mm-hmm. Very good. Attention! Attention! We're going through an area of great turbulence! Buckle your seatbelts and brace yourselves! Hey, honey. Something wrong? Mommy. This happens to some pregnant women. Hormones, stress... It was the kids, I know it. They're punishing me for what I did to them. You see perversion where there is none. - Children are incapable of doing... - Why do you always take their side? Why can't you even remotely consider the possibility that I might be right? Daddy! Hmm? Daddy! Come play with us, please? I'm coming! Good evening, and thank you all for being here with us again. I say "you all" in a more colloquial way. Because on today's show, we'll be addressing kids exclusively. Hello? Hello. This is Lola, Tin and Tina's mother. I don't know if you remember me. Of course I remember you. I just wanted to know how your son was doing. Is he better? My son died three days ago. - Lola? - ...the ladies of Tightfist. Hey, what's going on? The boy is dead. Don't go. Please stay with me. Just for today, call in sick. Say you can't go. You know I can't do that. Please, I beg you. - Don't leave me alone with them. - Lola, you need to get some rest. For the baby's sake and your own. What you're going to do now is go to bed and get some sleep. And tomorrow, when you wake up, I'll be right here, okay? Promise me? I promise you. Go on. Daddy. Why doesn't Mommy love us anymore? - ...the year that dies? - No! Why do you say that? She gives us mean looks and won't talk to us. Mommy loves you both very much. The thing is, uh, women who are pregnant get very tired. And they need a lot of love. Why don't you show her tomorrow how much you love her, huh? You and your little brother. Come on, give me a kiss. I gotta go. Kids, we heard you like laughing. They like to laugh. That's horrid. Torquemada and his men must be spinning round in their graves. Adolfo. Mm. Adolfo! Tin. Tin, untie me. What are you doing? Tin, untie me right now. Good morning, Super Mommy. You need to rest up and eat well. Or our baby brother won't be born. - I put some magic powder in it. - Huh? And now, for your entertainment, please welcome Rupertín! One, two, three! Here we are with you again today! - No! No! - It's delicious. ...unique of game shows and getready... ...to test your knowledge. Please, time to leave your grouchiness behind. And join us for the best half hour on television! Come on! Drink! It's not working. I guess we'll have to try and find another way to feed our baby brother. I have an idea! Where are you going? Tina, untie me! Look. Tin, you never cease to amaze me. What you're doing is a mortal sin. What do you think God would say? Shhh. Religion is forbidden in this house, remember? One, two, three! Everybody, please, pay attention! Sit back and relax and we'll soon start the show! Poison! Poison! Poison! Poison! - Poison! - Mommy. Stay away from me! It's just milk with some sugar. Lola. Lola, for God's sake, it was just a kids' game, and you were pointing a knife at them. - They tried to poison me. - They were making you breakfast. That's all. It was my fault. I'd asked them to show you some love. I understand you were afraid that you would lose the baby again, but you didn't. Everything went well, and the baby is doing great. Let's start over, all right? Mmm. Here's your mom and dad. - Hi. - There you go. He looks just like me. Hi, little prince. He's adorable. Come here, kids. This is your little brother. He looks just like a peanut. Can I give him a kiss? Come on. Be gentle with him. Hi, little brother. When is he going to be baptized? He's not going to be baptized. But children that aren't baptized go to Limbo. And that's a horrible place. Lola, come on, most babies get baptized. Well, this baby will get to choose his religion when he comes of age. - Times have changed, all right? - Maybe. But we do live in a democracy, and you know what that means, right? The will of the majority prevails. Who wants him to be baptized, hmm? No. No. The people have spoken. Anything yet? No! And now? - Yes! Now it's on! - All right! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, from the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid... Mommy! Mommy, look! Mommy, come see what we're doing! Mommy! It's a miracle! We're walking on water! Ah, come on, get out. Don't stay in the sun too long, and put on some sunscreen. - Lola. - What? Get me another one. ...and many, many photographers... And we're getting ready. We're just waiting now. Is the omelet ready yet? The game is about to start. Look, I'm doing my best. Hey. What? Aren't you forgetting something? Throw-in for the Spanish national team. And Dremmler... moves it to Förster. - Förster with a slick pass to Kaltz. - Tin, I think she's gone. Daddy, we're going to bapt... You two, I wanna watch the game in peace, all right? - They've got it back. - Hmm. Oh, we have a... We have a dead play. We're going to have to go for the corner kick. Hey, calm down, you. Come on, you little chickies. Hello, little brother. Shh. Quick pass. Kaltz. Kaltz making his move. Dremmler. Dremmler open to Förster. Förster. Förster sending it back to Breitner. There we have Camacho, who is chasing, as you can see. Hey, relax. Again, Dremmler for Bernd Förster. There we have Zamora next to him. No need to be afraid, okay? You just have to stay relaxed, all right? ...the right back of the Spanish team. There we have Camacho. Now, hold him by his feet. He's really heavy. - "Genesis 1:2." - Breitner gets the ball. "Now the Earth was formless and empty." "Darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters." - Now? - Mm-mm. Breitner's with him. "I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean." "I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols." "I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." Okay, now. Dremmler. Dremmler to Kaltz. The German team is dominating the field. Five, six, seven, eight, nine. Go on, go away. Can I take him out now? No. We need to purify him well. - Dremmler shoots. - No. No, no, no, no! What? Dremmler foots it in! The Germans have scored. We're going to get wiped out. He passes to Camacho. Mommy? What are you doing?! What's going on? My baby! My baby! What have they done to you? Mommy. We were bapti... But Daddy said we could... What kind of father are you? They're drowning your son and you don't see it! - Give me that! - No! No, Daddy! No, Daddy, no! No, Daddy! - No, please don't! - No, no, no! - No, Daddy, no! - No! No! Please! You are not my children. No! No! I'm sorry. Are you sure about this? Yes. Yay! Handsome boy. There you go, sleep now. Are you okay? The children. They no longer have a family to celebrate with. Listen, we agreed not to talk about this anymore. I wonder if I was a bad mother. - I'm sure they must hate me. - Don't torture yourself. It wasn't a good idea to adopt them. I told you right from the start, I thought they were strange. Honey, if we want to be happy, we have to look to the future. And the future is this little guy here. He is how we're going to move forward. Jesus of my life. You are a child like me. That is why I love you so much and I offer you my heart. Take it. It is yours, not mine. Jesus of my life, you are a child like me. That is why I love you so much and offer you my heart. Do you hear that? That is the wrath of God. That is the wrath of God. The day of wrath is drawing near. And on this day, justice will prevail. Galatians 6:7. "Do not be fooled, God cannot be mocked." "For whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." "Do not be fooled, God cannot be mocked." "For whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." Good night, children. Good night, Mother Asunción. I'm going to look for a job. As a seamstress. Honey, you're talking nonsense. Who's gonna look after the baby? Are you not hearing him cry, or...? Lola. Can you pick up the baby, please? Can't you see he's crying? Why can't you do it? You know I'm not good at this. I'm asking you. Please, pick up your son. Lola, what do I have to do to get you to pick up your son? I'm begging you, please! Sorry. Come here. There, there, now. Come here. Don't drive so fast. I'm not driving fast. Watch out! You both okay? What was that? No idea. Probably a deer or something. A lot of them around. Good night, sweet boy. You left the door open. Funny. Could've sworn I closed it. Sit down with me. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Lola. - Please. - So we can start playing. - Come. - ...easy to win a million. Let's ask the audience. Who would play with that? And who would keep the oyster? What will there be behind the wall? Please, open the door. This amazing pumpkin! Woo-hoo! - Oh my! Wow! - Look at that! Oh my! I think we'd be very good at this. Should we try out for it? Lola, what's the matter? Why did you take your ring off? This is a joke, right? Is this a joke, Lola? Oh, fuck. Honey, uh... I've devoted my whole life to you. I gave you a nice house, nice clothes, good food, even a son. And this is how you repay me? Lola. I love you very much. I love you both so much. Is this because you think I haven't been a good father? I don't know. Maybe you're right. But I can change, Lola. Mm. I'm able to change, and I will change. Where are you going? To fix the TV. What a wonderful prize! I'm so excited to tell you... Adolfo, it's working! Just in case the light goes off, you'll be able to enjoy the sun in a terrace in Malaga... Children? Children? Where are you? Children? Don't hide! This is not a game! Which one was it? Adolfo, the power is out! Come on. Come on! Damn flashlight. Lola! Lola! Lola! Adolfo! Adolfo, I'm coming! I'm coming, Adolfo! Adolfo! Adolfo! A blanket! Blanket! I need a blanket! A blanket! A blanket! Come on! Where's a blanket? No! Don't come in! Don't come in! Don't come in! Don't come in! No! No! My baby! My baby! My baby! Help! Please, help! Shh. Quiet. We have great people. The Spanish people, who deserve all of our sacrifice. After years of fear and uncertainty, the transition period is over. General elections are a turning point in the history of our country. Lola. Lola. Can you hear me? The police told me what happened. I'm very sorry about your husband. What happened? They say that he was struck by lightning. Lightning? Apparently, there was a lot of lightning in the area last night. A real tragedy. I prayed for his soul. And I prayed for you, too. My baby? He is safe and sound. When God shuts a door, He opens a window. And the children? Were they at the house? In the house? Of course not. Tin and Tina slept all night in the convent. I know. I'm the one who woke them up this morning. - But... - No. They weren't there. It's impossible. The children... are innocent? Mm. They've always been innocent. They are innocent. Reading of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew. 18:1-5, 10. "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, 'Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?'" "He called a little child to him... ...and placed the child among them." "And he said, 'I tell you the truth...'" Mommy, do you like them? "'...and become like little children...'" They are beautiful, son. "'...you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven.'" "'Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom...'" Come, daughter. "'And whoever welcomes a little child like this...'" Can you put it on me? "'...welcomes me.'" "'But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.' Amen." Amen. Amen.
