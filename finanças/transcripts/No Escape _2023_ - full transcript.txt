Everything that went down in Bali Keys is my fault. Skipper, there's a boat following us. Even at full throttle, we can't outrun them. There's an opening! Shit, I don't think we're gonna fit. Everybody down. Guys, stay quiet. Where is Denny's fucking place? A weak fucking hypocrite. Joe, you're right. I am weak. Pack your shit up. Get off my boat. Someone has to tell Lana that there are certain things you can't outrun. To prove to you that I'm on your side, I'm not gonna show this photo to the Australian police. Why am I the only one who keeps having these-- these nightmares about what we did? We could be heading right into a tropical storm. What choice do I have, wait here for them to come back and slit our throats? Gotta stem the flood. Give him the signal. I couldn't stop it. I'm sorry.

I'm--I gotta-- Shell, I was-- I'm sorry, Shell. For what? This bad shit, it's all my fault. I--I--you know, I deserve it. You don't, Shell. You're a good person. - How'd he get like this? - You are a good person. Well, we-- we were celebrating. Celebrating what? - Oh. - Just being alive. Whilst you're on watch? Go. Go, go, go, go.

Where are we going? We're going to bed. Oh. Hey! Yeah. Come on. And again. What's he on about? What does that mean? That we're fucked, Lana. Four knots. Is that good? No wind. We can't sail. Because... karma stole our wind. Just stop it with the karma bullshit that Joe was banging on about, please. No. No, Kitty. It wants us. You're cursed. This is the curse, is it? What the hell? It's for my knee. And Aaron has a bad knee, too, does he? How much did Aaron have? We're way off course. What the hell was he doing? We're being chased, Shell. He--he wanted to put them off the scent. But using most of the fuel going in the wrong direction. What the fuck, Aaron? He got us away, didn't he? Away from where? How are we supposed to get to Palau now? We're stranded 200 miles from any land. We'll use the last of the fuel to find some wind. It's too risky. We could be left out here, stranded with nothing. We should wait for the wind, and it'll give us some time to check the patch. Wait to get caught? That's a bad idea. All our ideas are bad. That's what we're doing, Denny. If Aaron wakes up and decides to do something different, fine. Until then, we're doing it my way. Fine... Captain. No more horse tranquilizer. Hey.

It's not pretty, but it should hold. Denny, what are we doing? What do you mean? I thought we had a plan. We do. I'm just worried about Aaron. This is not good. He's just drunk. He'll be fine. He's an addict, Lana. Trust me. When he falls off the wagon, things get very bad very fast. That's all the more reason to get away from him. When we get to Palau, and we sell the diamonds-- I mean, he treats you like shit, anyway. He's still my brother. I owe him. You understand, don't you? Is she OK? I don't know. You can ask her yourself. It's a bit early. Never too early. Is everything OK? I won't tell Shell if you don't. I think we're both on Lana's shit list. Mm. What, do you want me to apologize for voting you off? No, hey, it's fine. No hard feelings. Since we're... already in trouble--hold that. bit more than that. Just for starters. Hello? Don't scream. After Palau, after what happened... We decided to head straight home. But the terrorists must have been tracking us all the way from the Philippines. By the time we spotted them, we-- We couldn't outrun them. And... you know, Aaron... Well, he told everyone to hide while he got the tender ready. But they slit his throat before he could get there, so... Then they searched the boat and found the others. I mean, I was a fucking coward, Lana. I stayed hidden, even when I heard the shots. And I knew they must all be dead. I just...hid. They had so many guns. I just-- And then when I came up, the... boat was empty. All the bodies were in the water, and... there was blood on the deck, in the cabin. And I just gunned it of there. 'Cause-- I don't know. I just took the tender in case they came back. Fuck. Keeps going round in my head. Should I have done something or-- I don't know. There were too many of them. I'm sorry, Lana. I'm sorry I couldn't save her. I-- I think I need-- I think I need to go. I think-- - No, no. - Wait. Wait. You need to stay here. Look, I just need to talk to her real quick, OK? She's upset. Please. Hey, wait. Here she is. Here she is. Are you connected to the boat? What happened to the rest? Are you the only survivor? Can I just get one quote? Miss! Miss! Hey, Lana. Lana. It's all right. Just--just breathe, yeah? It's OK, all right? Just--come on. Just put--put your hands on the ground. Just feel the ground. That's it. Just feel the ground. Oh. Shh, it's OK. Breathe in. Breathe in. Come on. It's OK. It's OK. Oh, Joseph, he was-- he was right. He was right. What? How did you get here? After Shell dropped me off at the village, I swung back over, and I hid here in the store. - You're a fucking nut. - Hey, hey. You can't tell them I'm here. Yeah, I can. I have to. They'll fucking kill me. Aaron, he's a psychopath. If you tell him I'm here... I'm dead. Don't be stupid. He's not gonna hurt you. Are you sure about that? OK, there's no one here. You're gonna have to hide in my cabin. Come on. Come on. Quick, quick, quick. Whoo! Whoo.

Maybe I wasn't really thinking. Why are you actually here? I came back for you. I'm sorry. I was--I was worried about you. You're just not safe with these people. What are you talking about? They don't care about anyone but themselves. But you're different. You're a good person. Where did you get that idea? The tragedy is, you can't even see it. I shouldn't have come here. I know I have no right to ask you to help me. But you're helping me right now, which shows that I was right about you. Whoo! Whoo! Hey. Hey. You OK? Yeah, I'm fucking great. Hello. How about you?

Get behind the door, quick, quick, quick. Hey, I think I need backup up there. They're all out of control. Yeah, well, you're an adult, so I'm sure you can handle it yourself. I am sorry about earlier. I just got a bit freaked out by Aaron. Yeah, sure. It's fine. It's just, when he needs me, I don't know if I can just... leave him, you know? Come here, you. I do want to be with you, Lana. Look, I-- What? You are still with me, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. I know it's complicated, but I do need to know... If you still got my back. Of course. I just think Aaron's gonna wake up in a minute, so I don't think we should risk anything. - You're tired? - Yeah. - Me too. - Tired. Yeah. OK. I'm gonna go to bed. - Good night. - Night. Good night. - Thank you. - Fuck you. You cannot stay in here. Why? Because of him? You know you're not the first girl he's done this to? Done what? Well, the charm, the exciting secrecy. Then he gets bored of them, and they disappear. Well, I'm still here, so-- Yeah, for now. Just get out of my way. I should have known. You're like the rest of them. Move. What? What do you want? Lana! Lana. Lana! Lana. Shh. Please, Lana. Kitty. Kitty. Kit. Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty. Kitty. Aaron! Oh, what the fuck? Hey, man, what the fuck are you doing here? I see you're still a-- you're still a little-- you're her puppy dog, right? That's nice. - Hey, Aaron! - What the fuck? That's nice. Whoa. You should shut your mouth. I see you've been spending too much time with these Neanderthals. You start to sound like them. You're a fucking dick, you know that? Shell, he's trying to wind you up. Hey, Aaron! Oh. Where have you been hiding, Joseph? With her? I hid in the galley store. Why the fuck would you do something... like that, Joseph? I see. Oh, that's very fucking sweet. But as you know, she's fucking my brother. Mm. Well... Aaron. I want an answer. I told you to get the fuck off my boat, hmm? Why are you still here? OK. Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. Come on. Come on. Calm down, man. Just put the gun down, man. Calm--just calm down. I'm here because I'm guilty too. I agreed to keep the badge. I am as responsible for that boy's death as you are. It will forever stay with me. It will haunt us. And that's why I'm here, because we can't run away forever. You must see that. We--we have to pay. We've already given the money and the jewels back. I don't need money, stupid Shell! I'm talking about justice. Justice? So when we get to Palau, we must hand ourselves in to the authorities, take our punishment. In prison? A small price to pay for true freedom. Otherwise, you'll always be running, Aaron. Sorry, I am not... No, no, no. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Going to prison... Aaron, no, no. OK, OK, listen. For you or anybody else on this fucking boat. You have the greatest need for absolution. The boy who died is not the first ghost to haunt you. And what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Hmm? What's her name? What's her name? What's her name? Was it Helen? Aaron! Hey, hey, hey. No. - Aaron, stop! - Aaron, get off! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Aaron. Aaron, no. No! - Get up! - Aaron, no, no, no. - Stop. - Up! Aaron! No. He stays in there until Palau. No, you can't do that. If anyone... tries to let the fucker out... I will shoot them. - Put the gun down, Aaron. - Hmm? Aaron, put it down, OK? It's OK. Just walk away, Lana. Walk away. I warn you. Walk away. No, no. Lana, don't. You're all going to jail, you fuckers! Fucker! Don't move! Hello! Mayday. Mayday! All right, get down. Get down. Where's he gone? That was nice and fucking stupid. You can't just lock people up. - Now he's got a gun. - We need to find him. I'll get some light. I'll talk to him. Sure. If you find him before Aaron does, yeah. Come on, mate. Joseph. We should sort this out together. ♪ When the kids start singing ♪ ♪ And the band begins to play ♪ Kitty? Kitty? Kitty? Mum? Kitty. Are you OK? What have you taken? Right. Kit. It's me. I confess.

Joseph! - Well, where was he? - Joe, where are you? Can you see him? - Joseph! - Joseph. - Joseph. - Where'd you see him? - Joseph! - Joseph! Joseph! He's gone under. The current dragged him down. Joseph! Joseph, can you hear us? Here's the gun. Did Joseph fire it? I don't know. I just saw him in the water, but I can't see him anywhere now. - Joseph! - Hurry up. Get the flares. Come on, Heinrich. Where are the lights? Joseph! Denny, get the tender ready. We can use it to search. Yeah. I'm gonna need more light. Put up a flare or something. - Aaron. - What? Fire the flare. - Aaron. - Yes. I need help here. OK? Good. Joseph! - Heinrich, hurry up. - Yeah. We need to talk about what happens now. We need to keep looking. He wasn't wearing a life jacket. He wouldn't--wouldn't have survived this long. Well, we should put out a signal or an alert. We do that, we may end up dead or in jail. Yeah, but we can't just leave him. He shouldn't have been here. Officially, he wasn't. He wasn't on the manifest. According to the logbook, we left him in the Philippines. We can't just pretend that he didn't exist. We've got to do something. Heinrich? Shell, come on. We need to talk about what happens now. - No. There should be a vote. - No. - We should vote. - No, fuck voting. This is a clear call. This wind might not last, and we'll be stuck again. Come on, Aaron. There must be something. Listen to Shell. Use the wind. No. No! It's my boat. It's my decision. Put the gun where I can't find it. All right, let's rig the sails. Come on. Hey, someone's got to get around the side there. Can we get somebody on the side? Do you want a drink? Mm-mm, no. I'll get you a tea. Oh, I'm sorry. No, you don't need to be sorry. Hasn't happened since Mum left. Thanks. Why are you being so nice? You must hate me after what I did. Shit happened. It's in the past. And I could never hate you... Even after what you did. Those fucking diamonds. Shh. I'm gonna tell the police everything. It might help them catch whoever did this. Let's take a minute here now, OK? Tell them it was all me. I don't care if they lock me up. We just took a bag. That's all we did. I know, Emma. Kitty told me. The police asked about her, about who the fifth person on "The Blue" was. But I gave a different name. They won't find out what she did back in the UK. She said she-- She said she wanted you to be free... and happy. Hey. You OK? What? Joseph. Joseph. Is-- Where's Joseph? Where's Joseph? Did he-- Wait. Wait, what-- What do you remember about what happened up there? Did I-- Did I do something? Kitty-- Denny, tell me. I mean, it's not the first time it's happened, right? Fuck. Yeah, OK. Did I...kill Joseph too? Did I? Look, I-- Kitty... I won't tell... anyone. Sadly, based on the new information we've just received, we're not expecting to find any more survivors. This is--well, it's... You don't have to talk to them if you don't want. Dennis, I would love a picture, please. Is this a criminal investigation? Was anybody else involved? Are you sure that you can't make a statement? I know you... Dennis, can you tell us what happened on "The Blue"? Look, I appreciate you've all got papers to sell. He tells quite a story-- an attack in the darkness, ruthless gangsters, a massacre from which only he escaped. I was hoping you could shed some light on a bit of a puzzle, though. The ballistic report says that all of the bullets and the bullet holes found in the boat, the bullets that must have been used to kill your friends, were shot from a small-bore revolver, Smith & Wesson. Usually criminals among my countrymen would prefer automatic weapons, so... it's strange. So what are you saying? Perhaps your friends didn't perish in quite the way he's telling it, assuming they really are dead. Why would he lie? I thought you might know. No. No. Denny wouldn't do that. - You sure? - Emma? You got my number. Let me begin by saying that these two days-- Look, look, look, look. There he is. There he is. There's Dennis and that girl. Dennis! Dennis! Can you come here? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis, please. Just one more minute. Just one more question. Dennis, please. Just want to ask one more question. No more. Take them off. Thank you. Stay there, please. Mum and Dad are cool. You can stay as long as you like. Thanks. They're so happy one of us is alive, I think they'd agree to... anything... Even if I'm not their first choice. You must have been so scared... All those men with guns. Yeah. I can't stop seeing them. I'm so happy you're here. I don't know what I'd do if you weren't. I'm so glad I'm here too.
