- Val. - No, no, no, no, no. You don't call me that anymore. Just stay away from me. - Please, Valerie. - Glen, Glen, Glen. - It's okay. I'm here. What, what? No! They said they were coming back. - Baby, how did this happen? - I went for a walk. - I wanted to tell you. I'm pregnant. - Yes, that's why we're celebrating. - What's happen... - Shh. For better or for worse. - Don't leave. - You win. You said you wouldn't talk the whole trip, I took the bet, I owe you $100. - Don't worry about it. - No, no, I'm a man. A man who's word is as strong as Chinese handcuffs. You're still upset, I acknowledge that, I do. But, you should be happy now 'cause you'll have 100 of my dollars, proving, in fact, that you are capable of not saying shit when you're angry. - Robert, are you finished? - No, no, no. I think it's terrific that you didn't talk for three straight hours. Yes, I'm finished. Now. - $100. - I don't have the money on me right now. - I'll take what you've got. You're really taking my money? - Oh, I'm taking your money. - Oh, wonderful. - Hmm. - I'm looking forward to this weekend. - Annie knew we would work it out. - She said the same thing to me. Well, she's my friend, too. Jenny. Come on. Ah. I got it. - You left for over a week. Leaving no clue as to where you went, no calls, no nothing. - Well, I. I guess I just need some time to think. - Robert, it was just a fight. We're gonna have many more in the future. - Well, with that attitude, yeah. All right, look. Hey, it's our one time a year for everyone to get together and I don't want to ruin that, all right? Can we just? - No, because everyone's gonna be talking. - No one's gonna be talking. - Robert, our friends like to talk. - All right. I hope no one will be talking. - You know what? You can talk to me. That's our deal. We work through things. - Can I say something? - I'm listening. - I'm good for the 100, all right? Oh, my god. Who are we renting from again? Her name is Betty. Oh, Betty. I told her 4:30. I hope she's nice. Nice enough to let a bunch of children pretending to be adults rent it for the weekend. No shit. - I told her it was a bunch of college roommates. - Yeah, drinking heavily. - How else would we relive the glory days? - And smoking pot? - Oh, those glory days? We are in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, seriously. - So, you know what? We can be as naughty as we want. - You think so? - Well, I was hoping there'd be a little naughty. - Hmm, we'll see. - I brought my sexy underwear. - Which ones? - The ones with the Captain America shield. - Where's that? - Over my penis. - Yes. Michael. - Let's get him. - Jesus. Even from this vantage, I'm lost. Where the hell are we? Your turn to pick this year, Robert, and you bring us here? I like the quiet. - Well, I'd like Zac Efron locked in a cage on my bed, but you know? You, come here. Hi. - God bless you, God bless this little girl. Now, are you happy? - I'm happy. - Good. Come here, brother. Hey, man. - Don't you leave her again. All right? - Michael, you're doing it again. - Isn't he so cute? That will be all, Brian. You may wait in the car. - Michael. It's good to see you again, Brian. Hi. Hi. - And you can come in. I say it's okay. - Brian, this is Robert. Robert, this is Brian. - Nice to finally meet ya. How do you do it? - Put up with his shit? - Put up with his shit. - You're so cute and little, I just love him so much. Oop. Hold on a minute. Hayden? Well, you're lost? Hayden? Dropped call. Of course, right? - Yeah. What was the point? - Can you hear me now? Jesus. - Can I get one of those for you? Thanks, yeah. It's nice to get out of L.A. - Yeah, Michael's been talking about bringing you for a while. Glad you could make it. Let me get that for you, babe. Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, wow. - Isn't it amazing? Yeah. Is it time for Betty yet? Uh, now she's late. Look who made it. - Ah, finally. Let's go say hi. What's up, suckerfish? What's going on, blowfish face? - Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Have you lost weight, huh? - I have not, but thank you for noticing. - Wait a minute. Maybe you're thin because I've lost weight. - Oh, yeah. I think that's great. Boop. - He-he. Hi. - Oh, my god. Congratulations, girl. Thank you. Look, look what he did. - Wow. It looks like you finally got it right, huh? Fucker. - Fucker. Good to see you, buddy. - Good to see you, too. Oh, say hello, babe. - Hello, babe. - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Where are my manners? I'm Michael and you must be Marsha. - It's Sandy. - Oh, Sandy, yes. Well, I've heard nothing about you. - Ah, Jesus, Michael. Come on. - Now, come here, come here, sweet Sandy. Let me take a look. Woo. I love her. You don't deserve her. Well, the jury's out on that one. - Are you Robert? Oh, Betty, hi. - I see you got the whole crew here. Yep. - Sorry I'm late. Front door, back door. That's it. - Thank you. - You guys like the quiet, don't ya? - Well, he does. I always pick Vegas, Betty. If you must know. - We promise to keep it down. Ah, no need to. Got enough quiet to spare. - Well, that's nice. You guys got your pot? 'Cause if you don't, I can get you some. - Oh, Betty, I love you. Well, it's what the Mr. and I used to do when I lived up here years ago. Y'all ain't never seen so many stars in one place except right here. And you see them on dope? Oh, stars are just flying. Oh, Betty, you may just be my mother, huh? Wouldn't be the first bastard out there. Okay, there's a phone in there just in case. And there's a liqueur store down the road a bit. About 40 minutes. Well, Robert was supposed to take care of that. And I did. I was supposed to bring the pot. - This isn't a sting operation, is it? 'Cause I gotta ask you. Are you a cop? - Betty, I'm a lawyer. - He's the one that saves you from the cops. - Yep. Oh, God bless America. Yes, ma'am. You kids have a good time. Thanks. - Oh, and leave the keys. I need 'em. Last guy just up and left. He did leave the place spotless. Thanks, Betty. Thank you, Betty. Thank you. Bye-bye. - She's wonderful. Where did you find this place again? - Um, Google. Incoming! - Hey, you. Hey. - How are you? Good, how are you? - Good. So, are you guys? - Yeah. - I knew you would. It is Robert. Yeah. - Wow. It's beautiful. - Yeah. Want to see the house? - Yeah. - Hey. Um, sorry. - You should be. - Come here. You okay? I'm good. Aw. Oh, yeah. Show's over. - My friends like to talk. - Looks like the show's about to begin. There is a cougar on the fireplace in here. It's humongous. - Seriously, this is a brand new one. Um, just came to my head. ♪ I've got a girl named Sandy ♪ She's 'bout the cutest girl I ever did see ♪ She loved my daily - Baby. Well done. - I take it rare. - Since when? - Hey, grub's on, folks!

Oh, wow. - I'm going to smoke some pot with Michael. Uh, okay. - She likes me better than you, hmm? - Hmm. But, she give me something a little bit more. - When I smoke pot, I feel sexy. You should smoke some pot. - You might feel sexy. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. - So, you're a photographer? - It's a hobby right now. I'm actually just a waiter. - Michael says you're good. - You want to check it out? - Yeah, can I? - Sure. Okay, just push that button right there. - Okay. You took this? - Yeah. - Oh, my god. It's so cool. Oh, I wish I was a photographer. So cool. - Why aren't you? - Well, I'm on the last chapter of my dissertation, so I guess it's a little late now. - Dissertation for what? - Psychology. - Oh. - I always wanted a creative mind like that, but now I'm gonna spend the rest of my life just dissecting people's thoughts. Fascinating. Honestly, who cares why people do what they do, you know? People just make stupid fucking decisions. - Are you venting to me? - Yes, I am. - You know, Michael. He asked for my number after I served him his fifth piece of key lime pie. - You never know. - You never do. - All right, I need to know. - No, no, no, no. - Robert, this is between me and Jenny. You move away. Bring it. - Karaoke. - Oh god, that is awful. - Hayden, it was romantic. - I don't sing well. - Yeah, we know this. - He got up in front of everyone and sang Journey. Fucking Journey. - Open Arms. Oh, no. - And he butchered the hell out of Steve Perry's lyrics. - I don't sing well. - And he did it all while sipping on a shot of tequila. - Now, that was part of the plan. And he ran up right after, he yelled at everyone in the bar to just shut... - Shut your cake holes. - He got down on one knee, looked me in the eye and said. - Let's step into the unknown together. - Oh, now that is the shit that I needs to know. Yeah. - Cheers. - To Robert, and Jenny, and Open Arms. - Robert and Jenny, and stepping into the unknown. Yeah, that part. All right. Drink up. - I stepped into the unknown the other day.

Let's go looking. - Gee, I would love to, but I have a previous engagement with a fold-out couch and a tub of Red Vines. Hayden! - All right! Come on, let's go. Huh? Are you okay? - Yeah. - Go on, man. Have fun. - All right. - They're gonna get lost. - They'll be fine. See. Oh. - I'll leave you guys alone. - Sorry, Annie. It's okay. - You know, we're off. You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Go ahead. Jesus! Holy Christ. I just squirted. Sorry. I just saw you here and um. - I. Can't sleep? What's wrong? - When you guys had that fight, Robert came to my place. - Oh, my god. He was gone for over a week. I should've known that... - A week? No, he left that night. - Why did you come here? You think you know someone. Jesus Christ. - Good morning. Oh, it is just a morning and there is nothing good about it. - Check out Sandy. Oh, and it was just the first night. Jenny? Jenny, what's wrong? - Did you know? You're a good friend, Michael. - Fuck. - Good morning. - It's just a morning. Nothing good about it. - Did we have another dream fight, 'cause you know those aren't real, right? - I'm pregnant. - Morning. Good morning. - Guys, Hayden didn't make it home last night. I was so wasted, I passed out in the fucking boat. - Well, when did you guys separate? I don't even remember getting back to the house. Hayden! Hayden! - He's not in the house. - Well, where'd you guys go? - He wanted to see where the glowing was coming from. - That was a star light. - No, there was something. Something in the woods. I saw it. It was probably an animal. Hayden! - Hayden! Come on, man. This isn't funny. Hayden! Baby! Hayden! Hayden! Hayden! - Baby! - Hayden! - Hayden, come on. - Baby! - If I get poison ivy, I'm gonna be pissed off, man! - Hayden! - Hayden! - You guys were fucked up. - Yeah, he probably just passed out. - Oh, you think? - Yeah, I do. - I'm gonna go over here. Brian, come with me. Hayden! - Come on, man! - Hayden! - Hayden! Jenny. Hayden! Hayden! Hayden! Hayden! Baby! - Hayden! Hey, Jenny. Hayden? Hayden? Is that you? - Hey, guys. - Jesus, Michael! - Check this out, come here. It's pretty weird, right? Must be a coyote or something. Guys? - We're over here! I don't think that's a coyote. - We can't find him. What are they? - I don't know. - Shit. Hayden? Jesus. Hey, buddy. Hayden. Oh, god. Take it easy. What? Easy, easy. - We were worried sick about you, baby. Can I have some water? I'll get it. Dude, what happened? - I don't remember. - Hangover. I'd say nine, nine point five. - Thank you. Slow down, slow down. - Oops. Too much fun, baby? - Oh, fuck. What is that? - Here, wait, let me see. He just hit his head. He's okay. - I don't remember falling. - When you fall down and hit your head, that tends to happen. Take it easy. - I think I'm gonna go lie down. - I'm changing my rating. Hangover, 11. - What's with them? - I think you're gonna have to go cook me an omelet with no cheese and some jalapenos. - All right. - And this is disgusting. - Jenny? - I think I was almost jumped by a fucking raccoon. - Hey, Jenny? Babe. - Hey, you okay? You can find a ride home, right? You won't even listen to me? You spend all day locked in the bedroom and then you just decide to leave? Jenny. Robert, I can only use my imagination for so long. We were drinking, so you know, I can't really say what happened. - You just did. - Don't stop. What? - And then you want to wrap it. - You want me to just forget everything? Pretend to be happy so people won't notice how fucked up we are? - That's not what I want. - I don't even know who you are anymore. - I'm the father of your child. - Go fuck yourself. - What the fuck was that? - Were those headlights? - No way. No, that was something else. I'm gonna check it out. - Maybe it was the raccoons. Jesus. Where's Sandy? - I don't know, okay? I mean, I woke up and she was gone. - Wait, I'm sorry. What the hell do you mean she was gone? I mean, gone. What the fuck do you... - Hey, all right, all right! There's not a lot of places she could be, guys. Calm down. - Well, I just don't see how you could lose someone. - Here, let me, let me. - What were you doing in there, Hayden? - We were fucking, Jen. - Are you fucked up again? - No. - Any luck? - No. It's like that flash sucked all the power out of the house. - Well, what could do that? - I don't know. Did anybody check her bedroom? - She's not in here. - No, she's not. Wanna go back in the closet? Let's get out of here. - She's not in there. - The windows are locked from the inside. We would've seen her. - You sure you checked everywhere? Sandy? Sandy? - You all right, man? She's not down there. - Whoa, Speed Racer. You're the quickest Sherlock Holmes I've ever seen. Annie, it's okay, sweetie. Here, hold this. Now where do we look for her? - Why would she crawl out the window? - If something scared her enough, right? Do, do, do. Hayden? Come on, guys. Keep it light. - I'm a little freaked out right now, Michael. - Well, you're always a little freaked out right now, Annie. Good god. - What is that? - It's. What the hell? Oh, it's hot. - What do you mean it's hot? - The metal's heated up. There's no way someone could've done that. At least, I don't know how the fuck you could do something like that. - Don't get freaked out, Michael. - That's it, I'm calling the cops. - What the fuck is this? - This is really happening? Of course it is. - There's gotta be something we can do. No phone, no cell service. No Sandy 'cause this is a fucking joke. Great. - Michael, come here. - What is that? Is it a deer? Or that's something else. - Give me that. What the fuck is it? - Let me see. - Okay. - Where'd that come from? All right, just stay calm, all right? Everybody stay calm. - Robert? - What? - You're gonna need this. - Uh, okay. Jesus. Hello? Who's there? Hello? Grab her, grab her. Put her on the floor. Wrap her up, wrap her up. Get her. Got her? Watch her head. She's burning up. What's wrong with her? Sandy. Sandy, you're safe. - No one's safe. - Oh, god. Sandy. Sandy, where were you? - I was in the woods. - Someone's in the woods? - The wind was everywhere. I couldn't breathe. - Did you hear that? - My stomach hurts. It's okay. You're okay. - What the fuck is wrong with her? - Sandy. Sandy, who did this to you? Sandy? Sandy? Get her legs. Why? - We're getting out of here. - Jenny, get the door. Spin her. - Annie, get on the other side. Okay. - We follow the same route that led us here the first time we're here, we look for help. Got it? - Got it. Get in the fucking car, Hayden. No. Come on, come on, come on. - My car won't start! Does anyone know how to work one of these? I'm gay! - Let me see. Oh, my god. - What? We have no power? - Get her on the couch. Easy, easy, easy. Okay. - What the hell is out there? - Sandy? - Goddamn it! - Please, wake up. - Is she dead? - I don't know. I'm not a fucking doctor. - Where's Brian? - Brian? Don't do this, Brian. Brian? Brian? Brian! - Michael, calm down. - Do not tell me to be calm. One moment he's here and now he's gone? - We'll find him. - No! - Michael! Don't go out there! Michael, Michael! - Brian! Brian! Tell me where you are! Brian! Sweetheart! Brian! - We have to go back. They're coming. - Brian! - They have Brian. - Brian! - Come on! - No, Brian! No, no. - What do you mean they have him? What did you see? - It wasn't human. - That's bullshit, Annie. Someone did that to Sandy and someone took Brian. - Robbie? Are we sure every window and door in this place is locked? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - What the hell are we dealing with here? - I don't know. - It's not human. - Would you stop? - No, I won't stop! Annie, stop. Calm down. - A bright light and then Sandy suddenly disappears. I mean, her fucking necklace melted in the ceiling. It's not normal. You guys need to start thinking, I mean, really fucking thinking about what this all means. You guys don't want to talk about these disappearances, huh? What, you can't wrap your head around it all? - Oh, and you can, Annie? - I saw something watching us. It was right outside. We're like rats in a maze. And then Brian just up and disappears. Oh, my god. They know we'll freak out. - Annie, Annie. - They do. - You've got to shut up. - They know it, they know it. They want us against each other. No, they do. Shh. - They do. There's something different about Hayden and Sandy. What happens when they come back? Michael? - Brian? Why are you guys shouting? - Brian, stop. Where were you? - I was asleep. I got dressed when I heard you guys down there. - Dressed? - Maybe we missed him. Did we miss him? - That's not Brian. - Shut up! - Michael, I was in bed. I was taking a nap. - We were leaving. You were with us. You don't remember? Are you okay? - What happened to you? - I. - You disappeared. Sandy, who did this to you? Answer me. - What is wrong with you? Great vacation pick, Robert. Where shall we go next year, Elm Street? - Oh, fuck. They're coming. - We're gonna be okay. No matter what happens. - What? - Oh. Run! Come on, come on! Michael, come on! - Run! Go! Go! Go, go, run! Go, go, go, go. - Let's go! Annie, come on! Brian, let's go! - Come on, come on. Annie, go. Come on. - Ow. - Michael. Michael, come on. - No, Annie. Go, go. Go, go! No, no! Get off of me! Get off! No, no, no, no! - Robert! - Shh! - Shh! Over here. I found a hiding place. - No. No, we have to keep going! - Calm down, Annie. The others are waiting. It's not safe out here. - He's one of them, Jenny! - Annie, please. - Let go of her! - Let go of me! - Annie. Robert! Come on, come on. Oh, Robert. They're behind us. They're behind us. - Right where? Where? I don't see them. Where? - No! - Come here. Go, go, go! Go! Go, go! Run! - Come on! Shh, shh, shh. - Hayden tried to take us to them. What? - They're experimenting on us. - What are they? - I never want to find out. Oh, god. We can just. - Michael. - We have to keep them out. Robert, I'm not gonna kill my friends. - You won't have to. - Robert? What are you doing? Robert, no. Stop. - It's so quiet up here. - Robert, that fight. You were gone so long. Jenny. - They got you. - Jenny. Jenny. Run. Jenny? I'm so sorry. - It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Annie, listen to me. They take 'em one at a time. Okay? - It's the two of us. - Okay. And no matter what happens. - No matter. No! No! - Annie, you stay close to me, okay? - Maybe they're gone. - No, stay close. Annie. Annie! I'm the last. You took everything from me. - Jenny? Oh, Jenny. They don't mean us any harm. They've shown me everything. You'll see. Don't be scared. I'll be waiting here for you. Let's step into the unknown together. - I don't care where you come from. You're not taking me. You're not taking me. Robert. Please, please. No.
