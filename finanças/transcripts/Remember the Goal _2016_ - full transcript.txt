(solemn melody) (people laughing) (birds chirping) (indistinct chatter) - [Heidi] Are you our new coach? - Are you a member of the Orange Hills Academy girls cross-country team? - Yeah. - Then, yes, I'm your new coach. Good afternoon, ladies. My name is Courtney Smith-Donnelly, I'm gonna be teaching biology and science this fall. I'll also be your new cross-country coach this season. It's nice to meet you. Two quick questions. First, who all here was on the team last year? Please raise your hands. Everybody? Nobody here is new? - No. - Why no freshman? - The middle school team wasn't very good last year and none of the girls wanted to run plus nobody recruited them. - I see. - Do you mind me asking, but have you ever coached cross-country before? - No. No, this will be my first time. By the way, how far is your race? - 5K. - 5K? What's 5K, how far is that? - 5,000 meters. - 3.1 miles. - And this is a high school team, right? - [Katelyn] Right. - Thank you, good, that is helpful information. This second question may seem a bit premature, but do you girls wanna be a strong contender to win the state meet this year? - We finished 10th last year. - Yeah, Eastern Valley killed us. - Eastern Valley killed everybody. - You finished 162 points behind Eastern Valley, they've got four of their top seven girls returning this year, last year you all had three freshman, two sophomores, a junior, and a senior in your top seven which means that six of you are back. Coach Holloway was your coach, he was here for five years before that this program was run by Coach Pratt who founded it in 1982 and ran it until he retired. Orange Hills Academy is an all-girls Christian school and a member of the Private Schools Association, but has never won the state meet, that sound about right? - Yeah. - Which takes me back to my question, do you girls wanna be a strong contender to win the state meet this year? - Well, yeah. - Okay, I heard one yeah, anybody else? - [Girls] Yeah. - Okay, that sounds convincing enough, for the state meet then we shall train. Before I get your names and some more information, let's just take a little jog here. Do a lap around the field, let me watch you run. Just go very easy, okay? - Okay, girls, let's go. (triumphant melody) Your name is? - Kristen Sims. - Kristen, did you win state last year? - No, I finished sixth. - Yeah, I don't understand how you didn't win state because if what you just ran was easy, when you're on hard, you must be pretty fast. - Well, I ran track in the track in the spring and I've been training since the season ended, so I'm in good shape. - All right. The next time I ask you to go easy, just go easy, okay? All right, girls, gather up. One by one, I want you to tell me your name and grade. - Anna Glass, junior. - Heidi Olson, junior. - Kristen Sims, senior. - Shelby Opal, sophomore. - Katelyn Vann, sophomore. - Rebecca Shackleford, sophomore. - [Rachel] Rachel Ramirez, junior. - [Julianne] Julianne Barnett, sophomore. - Oh, hey, how was cross-country practice? - Easy, all we did was run 30 minutes. - Well, what do you think of the new coach? - I don't like her. - Her? - Yeah. Dad, she's right out of college, never coached before, and she doesn't know what she's doing. - What? - Yeah, I felt like I was walking today. - Why didn't you pick up the pace, make it a good workout? - I tried to, but she kept telling me to slow down. - Well, when she doesn't know what she's doing, you just do what you know. - Oh, I will, you can count it. - What about Anna and the other girls? - They ran easy. I tried to get them to go faster, but they wouldn't. - Why did Holloway have to take that other job? - I miss him. - And what's Prader doing hiring a rookie? Oh, don't worry, I'll have a talk with your new coach. - I'm telling you, Chase wants to ask you out. - He does not. - Yes, he does, honest. - How do you know? - Word gets around. - Well, I can't even if he does. - [Katelyn] Why not? - Because my dad is not going to let me date at 15 years old. - Mine will. - [Shelby] Mine won't. - How come yours will? - 'Cause mine doesn't care. - What about your dad? - He doesn't care either, but my mom does, she cares about everything. - Would she let you date? - No. - [Shelby] Why not? - 'Cause I'm only 15. - See! - Well, I wish my dad cared. - How come he doesn't? - I mean, you know where he lives, need I say more? - How long have they been divorced? - [Katelyn] Too long. - Do you see him often? - Not much, two or three times a year. - Does your mom care about what you do? - Sort of, but she's busy working and dating around. He's gonna ask you out. - To run cross-country and be successful, you need two things, endurance and strength. To win the state meet, we're gonna need one other thing and that's time, time to train and build up to the competitive level that we're gonna need to be at. It's very, very important that you make every practice, that you're eating right, you're getting good sleep at night. Starting things off, we're gonna run slow and easy, so we prevent any injuries. Any questions? - Where do you want us to run today? - I marked up a course like you ran last year, just follow my flags, you're gonna start here, run down the road, do the big loop, in the back, you'll see my one mile mark, keep coming around, two mile mark's just up here. Just after the two mile mark, I've got you set to run up this big hill, go all the way to the top, come back down, and do the whole thing again. - Coach, I hate hills, do we really have to do it two times? - Yes, and just think, in the near future, you'll be doing this whole thing three times. (girl clapping) - Woo! (girls laughing) - State meet's at Equestrian Park this year, any of you girls ever run that course before? - No. - No? Make sure you do that hill two times. Remember, we're running slow and easy, not hard. Oh, wait, wait, there's one more thing, and this is really important, I'm only gonna say this once, you've got one goal this year, that's to win the state meet. Remember the goal. - Good afternoon, Neal Sims. - [Courtney] Courtney Smith-Donnelly. - My daughter's Kristen. So, you're the new coach? - Yes, sir. - I heard that you've never coached cross-country before, you must feel like a kid with a new toy then. You know, we've got a great program here, it has been for years. Now, we don't have a lot of girls on the team, but this group, they won the regional meet last year, and I think they could be top five in the state this year, if they get some good training. - Well, I plan to do the best I can. - Yeah, speaking of plan, do you have one? Do you know what needs to be done? - I have an idea. - Well, Kristen could be a big help. She's got a shot at the state individual title this year and she'll have to train real hard. Now, I work with her in the off-season and well, Coach Holloway, he was a great coach. He worked 'em real hard. - Yeah, I don't believe running girls in the ground is proper training. Gonna take care of these girls and we'll still be competitive. Nice to meet you. - [Ken] The policy of this school is to first offer all coaching jobs to teachers on staff. - [Neal] But she doesn't know what she's doing. - Well, her background looked pretty impressive to me. - Her background looked good? What, did she run a year in middle school? - Come on, Neal. - You know what the problem is with this athletic department? You just don't care about the girls enough. My daughter could get a scholarship, but you treat cross-country like some second-rate sport. - I'm just following the policy of the school. - Ken, it is still summer, you could find another coach, one who knows how to train and do it right. - Coach Donnelly just started, why don't you give her a chance? - Just from what they've done so far, that is enough for me to see. My daughter has to do her own workouts on the side, we need to get Holloway back here or somebody like him. - Neal, look, we're a school, we are not a cross-country institution. We hired this woman to fill a position in science that we knew was coming open in the fall, when I sent out a letter seeking a new cross-country coach, she responded, her credentials looked good, so we hired her, she is the coach. Now, you have a problem with that, take it up with the principal. - Rebecca, didn't I ask you to do the dishes after dinner? - Oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot. - You forgot? - Yes, I'm sorry. - How did you forget? You have nothing to do all day except run. - I'm sorry, I really forgot. - Well, what if I forgot to make meals at night, what about that, huh? I mean, I asked you to do one thing and you can't even do it? Now, get out there and do it. - Hi. - Oh, hi. Anna! - [Anna] Coming. - Oh, perfect, you're both here. - [Anna] What's up? - I'm about to work out, you guys should come with. - Now? But we have practice later today. - Yeah, but it won't be hard. We need to get a good workout in. - I don't wanna do two workouts today. - Heidi, we could do really well at state this year, like top five, maybe higher, but we have to train not jog. - She said she wanted to make sure we didn't get injured early. - Okay, but did you get injured doing any of Holloway's workouts last year? - No, but I had sore muscles a lot. - Yeah, some of his workouts were really hard. - Yeah, but the hard workouts are the only way that we're gonna get any better. Now, come on, let's go. - I think we should just do what the coach wants us to do. - Okay, look, we're not getting to state meet with her. It's the first time she's ever coached and she doesn't know anything. So, let's go. - All right, good job. Good job, good job, everybody, same time tomorrow. Heidi, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You look a little stiff to me. - I'm okay, I may be a little tight, I just need to stretch more. - You're going easy out there, right? 'Cause this is the exact thing I'm trying to avoid. - Yeah, coach, I'm going easy. - Okay, well, keep me posted, let me know if it bothers you tomorrow. - I will. - We shouldn't have run with Kristen 'cause now look. - I'll ice it tonight, it should be okay. - What we did with you today was too hard. - No, it wasn't, you're just not in shape yet. - Shelby, what's up? - [Shelby] Nothing much. - Where you going? - My house. - Don't you have running practice? - Yeah, but that's later today. - Okay, then why don't you come on up and hang with us? - No, i can't. - What do you mean you can't? - I can't. - You can't what, hang with us? - You know what I mean. - No, I don't know what you mean. - What she means is that she can't and she has a very good reason why she can't and you should know what she means by saying she can't, understand? - No. - Too bad, see ya. - Hey, Shelby. - I can't. - How's your leg today? - It's okay, it feels better. - Still sore? - A little, but it does feel better. - We got another long run today, so just take it easy out there. - I will. - How about you, Anna? - Oh, I'm fine. - You know, I just thought of something. Whenever I was in high school, I played basketball, and I'd get sore muscles a lot and then I figured it out, it was always on days after I'd done a double workout, so I know just how you feel. (indistinct arguing) Okay, girls. For more than a month, we've been building a foundation. Today, we start a key workout we're gonna be doing a lot this year called cruise intervals. Each interval is one mile and you run it at tempo pace. Tempo pace is approximately 30 seconds slower per mile than your current 5K race pace. You're gonna run one mile, rest one minute, run your second mile, rest one minute, then run your third and final mile. You're gonna start right here at this flag, run the mile course that we've got marked off, finish right there at that flag. First flag out there, it's a hundred meters. To me, this is the most important part of the race, I want you to hit it in the time I tell you and maintain that pace for the rest of the way. We use our watches to make sure we're on pace, there's no sprinting in at the end of this. This is a tempo run, even pacing all the way. - Hey, coach, what do you mean by even pacing? - Do you know what pace you ran your mile splits in last year? - No, ma'am. - I do. My second mile is usually 25 to 30 seconds slower than my first. - Which tells me you went out too fast. - I finished sixth in state. - But if you would've run an even pace, then you probably could've finished even higher. - Do you know when a car gets its best gas mileage? When it's on the interstate cruising at 65 miles per hour not when it's speeding up and slowing down and the same thing is true with running. In cross-country, a lot of these kids go out very fast, they settle into a pace, and they all slow down. That's not how we wanna run. We wanna go out at the correct pace, maintain that pace for the entire way, even pacing. - Okay, check my chart for your hundred meter split, your mile split. - 24 seconds and a 6:24 mile? - That's right. - I can walk faster than that. - Anna, you see your splits? - Yes, ma'am, 25 and 6:40. - [Donnelly] Once you've got your pacing, let's get on the line. - Well, this will be easy. - Tempo runs build endurance, they're very important, probably the most important workout that we'll do, but for them to be effective, you have got to do them right. Do not, I repeat, do not run faster than the pacing I've given you, it defeats the purpose of a tempo run. Let's run the test hundred meters to check our pacing. Mark! Set! Go! Stop, stop, all of you are too fast. Anna, too fast, Heidi, too fast, Rebecca, Kristen, way too fast, all right. All of you back on the line. Okay, I'm gonna let you go the full hundred meters this time. When you get there, you're two seconds too fast, stop, come back, start again. If you're within a second on either side, adjust slight, keep going. Mark. Set. Go. - 6:11, that's 13 seconds faster than I want you to run. - This is too easy. - This is a tempo run not a mile race, you gotta get the pacing right. - I literally cannot run that slow. - Rest one minute and go again, this time hit 6:24. 6:42, way to go, Anna, rest one minute, then go again. Come on, Heidi. 6:51, good job, Heidi. - I'm three seconds slow. - No, come on, this is your first try, you're close. Good job, Rebecca, good job, Katelyn, 6:58. Way to go, Shelby, 7:04, right on pace. Kristen, 6:15, still fast, too fast. - No, it's not, it's too slow, I'm not even tired. - You're supposed to be running a 6:24, you've got one more, do it right this time. - You can't kick Kirsten Sims off the team, she is the best runner in the history of this school and it's her senior year. - She's defiant. - Let's make arrangements for her to do her own workouts then and we'll keep everybody happy. - No, I'm sorry, Mr. Prader, it does not work that way. - This has gotten out of hand. - Agreed, it should've been taken care of a long time ago, but I'm not her parent, I'm just her former coach. - I want you to put her back on the team. - Sorry, I can't do it, she's off. Kristen can run track and get her scholarship there and it's not gonna be a problem because I'm not coaching track. - You probably won't be coaching cross-country here next year either. - Mr. Prader, you cannot let parents dictate how you do your job or how I do mine. Kristen doesn't wanna do the workouts, so she's off the team. Look, if you're gonna fire me, do it after the season, but not now. I've already five weeks of my time this summer and so have these girls. - If you think that Neal Sims is gonna let this go, you're in for a big surprise. - And if Neal Sims were the coach of this team and Anna Glass were talking about, not doing workouts, what do you think he'd do about that? Make sure you ask him next time he calls. Kristen Sims is off the team. (somber melody) - Where are the other girls? - They quit. - What? - They quit. - All of them? - Yeah. - Why? - Kristen got 'em all to quit. - She tried to get us to quit, too. - Yeah, but we don't want to, we wanna run. - So, it's just the five of you? - Yeah. - And everybody else quit? - Yes, ma'am. - We only need five girls to score a meet, so let's make two new rules right now. Make a fist like this. Good. Put all your fists together side by side. We're a team. Okay? And nobody on this team quits, rule number one, agreed? - Yes, ma'am. - Second rule, nobody, I mean, nobody ever gets sick. All right, let's make one other rule. Why was Kristen dismissed from this team and why did all those other girls quit? Maybe because for them it was all about self, let's change that right now. 1 Corinthians 10:31, whether you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 10:31. - What? - 1 Corinthians 10:31, whether you eat or drink or run, whatever you do, do unto the glory of God. Okay, that's gonna take the focus off self, it's gonna put it on the one it's supposed to be on and that's the lord. What do you guys say, 10:31? - You guys still running? - [Heidi] Yeah. - How's practice? - It's okay. - We're sorry you're not there. We have our first meet tomorrow, are you coming? - Yeah, right, I'll see you guys in track. - Shelby. Go out with me this weekend. - What? - Go out with me this weekend. - I can't. - Can't or won't? - Can't. - Why? - I have a meet. - Those are in the morning, I'm talking about at night. - I can't. - Why? - You don't get it, do you? - Get what? - My dad won't let me date yet. - He doesn't have to know. Just walk down to my house tomorrow night around six o'clock. I'll be waiting for you. - I don't know. - Six o'clock. - I can't. - Don't be late. - [Heidi] Hey, did you hear about Savannah? - What about her? - Jesse told me she started smoking weed this summer. - What? - That's what Jesse said. - Is she sure? - Well, her and Savannah were hanging out over the summer and they met a couple of guys, Savannah started dating one of them and he got her into it. - Is she still dating him? - No, but she's still smoking. - And Jesse's sure? - Yeah. - Man, we used to be so close to Savannah. - Yeah, but... She's changed. Somebody just needs to talk to her. - She sits behind me in history. - Hey, coach, what are we doing today? - We're going easy, right? - I'm nervous. - What about? - Coach. - How's everybody doing? - Good, but what are we doing today? - About five miles. - On the day before the meet. - [Donnelly] We're going for a ride for about five miles, everybody hop in. - What's this? - This is today's practice. - We're gonna play golf? - Is that what you're here for? - No, really, are we gonna play golf? - Really, we are gonna play golf. - Hey, coach, I've been meaning to ask you, did you ever run cross-country in high school? - Yeah, I did. - Where you any good? - I was okay. - So, not that good, huh? - Not that good is not that good, but okay is okay, right? - Right. - I think the more appropriate question at the moment is how good am I at mini-golf?

We're gonna run a couple of starts before the race just to make sure we got our pacing down. All right, pacing for today. Anna, 25 seconds and a 6:40 mile, Heidi, 25 and a half seconds in a 6:48. - Wait, Coach, you want me to run a 6:40 first mile in the race today? - Yes. - That's too slow, I need to run faster. - I want you to run a 6:40 all three miles today. Remember, even pacing. - Coach, that's my tempo pace, I mean, I'll get killed. - No, you won't, you'll finish fine. - I could be in the top 10 today. - I want you to run the pacing I'm telling you to. - Why? - Remember the goal. - But coach? - Anna. Many times in God's word, he asks us to trust him, even though we don't understand or we don't know what's going on and just like that I'm asking you to trust me and remember the goal. - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. Okay, Rebecca, Katelyn, 26 and 6:56, Shelby, 26 and a half and 7:04. (people cheering) - Rebecca, you have to get out of there a lot faster than what you did. I kept telling you to pick it up, what was wrong with you today? - Nothing. - Well, you know you can't get caught back in the pack like that. I mean, look where you came in, come on. - I just ran how the coach wanted me to run. - Well, if you're gonna run like that, there is no point in even being on this time. - I just did what she said, give me a break. - You were awful. - Rebecca, you ran a nice race today. - I ran horrible. - No, you ran just like I wanted you to and you were right on pace, good job. Hey. Good job. - Hey, coach, may I have a word with you? - [Donnelly] Yeah. - Why did you have Anna run so slow today? She finished 37th, she could've been top five. - She ran a very smart race, she did a great job, she was right on pace, and I'm proud of her 37th. - Yeah, but, coach, this is not what we signed up for. - What did you sign up for, Mr. Glass? - [Glass] Well, not coming in 37th when she can be top five. - Winning state takes training and patience, today wasn't about winning. - Then what was it about? Why are we running if we're not running to win? - We're running to do our best and if that means winning, great, but if that means coming in 37th, that's fine, too. Anna did a great job based on the training that she's been doing and on the pace that I've given her. - It looked like she was jogging out there. - Cross-country is a lot like a puzzle, Mr. Glass, you gotta put it together one piece at a time. - Yeah, well, 37th is not the desired result. - No, it's not, but a 6:40 mile pace was and your daughter did that beautifully. You should tell her that some time before this day ends. Excuse me. - I don't know about this woman. - Neal Sims has already talked to the principal and the board. - [Chase] Hey. - I heard from every parent this morning before I finished my first cup of coffee, they say you deliberately had the girls run really slow in the race, now why would you do that? - Because that's the only way they'll get faster. - What? - Because that's the only way that they're gonna get faster. - That doesn't make sense. - Cross-country is a lot like Christianity, Mr. Prader, it doesn't make a lot of sense. For example, the way up is down. - What's that supposed to mean? - Well, do you remember in the bible when it says, "Humble yourself in the sight of the Lord, "that he may exalt you in due time?" Humble yourself that he make exalt you. The way up is down, it's the same thing with cross-country, in order to get faster, you have to train somewhere. - Coach, I need an explanation, these parents they deserve one. - No disrespect, sir, but these parents have no idea what it takes to win, they think the only way you get faster is to run yourself into the ground, kill yourself. No, I just told you to get faster, you have to train slower, this may not make sense to you, it may not make sense to these parents, it may not even make sense to these runners, but by the time state meet rolls around, it will. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a class to teach. - Hey, Savannah, you know we only have five girls on our cross-country team, you should come out for it, the coach would totally let you join. - What? - Come out for cross-country, you'd like it. - You're joking. - No, it's a great sport and there are a lot of positives to it. - What's positive about running all the time and getting tired and sweaty? - I mean, it's healthy for one, it's good exercise, keep you out of trouble, get to be part of a team. - No, thanks. - Where are the other girls? - [Anna] Oh, they're coming. Coach, can I talk with you a minute? - Yeah, of course. Actually, I got something for you and the girls. - Oh, cool, thank you. - You're welcome, what's up? - Well, I have a friend I wanna try and help and we used to be the best of friends and then she started hanging out with a different crowd and she's into things she shouldn't be. I feel if I say something, she's just gonna push me further away. - If it's on your heart to talk to her, then I would. - Well, I actually did ask her in class today if she wanted to join our team. - Yeah, what she'd say? - No, she's not interested and I'm mean that's not really what I wanted to talk to her about, I don't know, I feel like she's gonna reject what I say. - Well, if you're worried about upsetting your friend, just remember, Jesus was perfect, people hated him, so you'll be in good company. Think about that for a second, Anna. Jesus Christ came to earth, God in human flesh, perfect, sinless, always said the right thing, did the right thing, died on the cross for our sins, was buried, rose again, and what was the result? Most people hated him and when I was a junior in high school, one of my friends shared the gospel with me and God let me see that I was a sinner and I needed a savior, so don't be afraid of rejection, just talk to your friend, the Lord sees your heart. - Thanks, coach. - And Anna? If talking to her doesn't work, there is one more thing you can do. - [Katelyn] What are we doing today, coach? - [Donnelly] Cruise intervals. - [Katelyn] Again? - [Donnelly] I know how much you love them. - [Heidi] They're okay, we just do them a lot. - [Donnelly] Yeah, but today we do them with a twist. - [Katelyn] Ooh, what's that? - [Donnelly] Today, we're gonna do them five times. - [Katelyn] What? - [Donnelly] You girls can do this, I have faith in you. - [Heidi] Same pace as the others. - [Donnelly] Yeah, same pace. - [Rebecca] I'm not gonna be able to do the fifth one. - [Anna] Me either. - [Katelyn] I won't be able to do it, coach, it'll be too hard. - But you will try, right? Right? ♪ There will be a time for rest ♪ It's not today ♪ Maybe a time to just give up and turn and walk away ♪ Every choice will change your future ♪ Every day is part of the plan ♪ To get you to the best in you ♪ So you realize you can ♪ Run on ♪ Every step has brought you here ♪ Run on ♪ And the finish line is near ♪ Just run on ♪ Keep on going, just run on ♪ Don't stop moving, just run on ♪ Run on, run on ♪ Just run on ♪ Keep on going, just run on ♪ Don't stop moving, just run on ♪ Run on ♪ Run on - Good job today, good job, everybody, that was awesome. - Coach, that was hard. - [Donnelly] But you did it. - Yeah, but it was really hard. - Well, winning state meet is gonna be really hard, but it's gonna be such a great feeling, you're never gonna forget it. - Coach, I was dying on that last one. - But you did it. - Yeah, but I was about five seconds slower than I was supposed to be. - But you're gonna get better, we're gonna keep working, and you're doing great, all of you are doing great. - Hey, coach, are you sure you know what you're doing because my mom sure doesn't think so. I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to come out like that. I said I was sorry. - All right, gather around here for a minute. There is a story in the bible where a 12 year old girl had died and as was custom for that day, people gathered outside the house and were crying. When Jesus approached, he said, "Why are you weeping? "She's not dead, but asleep." The people laughed at him, then Jesus went inside and raised the girl from the dead. Any of you girls familiar with that story? - Yeah, I've heard it before. - Me too. - When Jesus said the girl was sleeping, the bible says they laughed him to scorn. They laughed at him. Mocked him, ridiculed him, were probably hateful towards him, said he didn't know what he was talking about, didn't know what he was doing, do any of you girls know why they did this to him? - No, ma'am. - Because Jesus Christ did things the exact opposite of the world. The world was going in this direction, he was going in that one. You see, when you follow Christ in this life, you are either going against the world or in the opposite direction of it, but you're never going with it. As a result, people will mock you, make fun of you, ridicule you, hate you without cause, they won't understand. They won't think you know what you're doing. So, just because we may be training differently than you did last year or running our races in what seems to be a strange way, different from every other team, doesn't mean it isn't going to be effective. Remember the goal. One other thing about that story, after Jesus went and raised that girl from the dead, what did he do afterwards? Did he go out front like a bigshot saying, "What was that you were laughing at? "What were you saying about me?" No. No, if I know Jesus, he slipped out the backdoor. Quietly, saying nothing, even though he could've said something, and that shows the great character and humility of Christ. That's the kinda person we wanna be like. Great job today. (indistinct chatter) - Savannah, Savannah, can I talk to you for a sec? - I guess. - I heard that you started smoking. - No, I didn't. - Savannah, come on. - Look, a lot of girls smoke. The bible doesn't say you can't. - Savannah, that-- - You don't understand, you've probably never tried it. - I don't have to try something to know if it's right or wrong. - I told you a lot of girls smoke, a lot of girls in this Christian school, I think about a ton more do in public school. - That doesn't make it right. - Like I said, the bible doesn't say anything about it. - Savannah, an alcoholic starts with one drink, a drug addict starts with one joint, it's pretty easy to tell if it's right or wrong. - You know, that's exactly why I don't hang around you anymore, you're just so perfect and judgemental. - Hey, coach, Katelyn's not doing very well. - [Donnelly] What's wrong with her, is she sick? - No, it's not that, her father is supposed to come watch her run this weekend, but now he's not. - Yeah, she hasn't seen him in about five months and it's been really hard on her. - She's really hurting. - We thought maybe you could talk to her. - Yeah, yeah, of course, where is she? You over here praying or something? - Praying, no, it's more like or something. - I heard about your dad not being able to make it. - All the other girls have families and I don't, my parents divorced and I don't get to see my dad, that's not fair. - Well, believe it or not, I know exactly how you feel. - Do you really? - Yeah, my parents got divorced when I was 11 and moved to cities that were four hours apart. - Mine are four states apart. - I'm sorry. - That's all anybody can say. - Well, maybe your dad can come to another meet. - That's what he said last year. - And? - He never made it. - What's your dad do for work? - He's a heart surgeon. - So, it's pretty tough for him to get away. - That's what he always says. - You know, Katelyn, I never picked up on the fact that this bothered you, you're kind of the comedian of our team. - Yeah, well, I have to do something to keep my mind off it. I gotta get ready for practice. - Okay, starting at this flag, running around the world up to my flag at the top of that hill, that's 300 meters. - No one told me were gonna do 300 meter repeats up that hill. Coach, why? - Because that hill is your best friend and when you've got a best friend, you spend time with them, right? - No. - Okay, we're doing 16 of these today. - 16, coach, that's three miles worth. - You got this, you run up at tempo pace, you walk back down to start, you go again, sounds like a good time to me. ♪ Run on ♪ Every step has brought you here ♪ Run on ♪ And the finish line is near ♪ Just run on ♪ Keep on going, just run on ♪ Don't stop moving - Good job, girls. ♪ Just run on ♪ Run on ♪ Run on ♪ Just run on ♪ Keep on going, just run on ♪ Don't stop moving, just run on ♪ Run on ♪ Run on - I hate hills. - Me too. - [Donnelly] Good job today, girls. - Thanks, coach. - Hey, Shelby, you were a little off on your pacing today, you seemed kinda distracted to me. - Yeah, maybe a little, I'll do better tomorrow. - Well, when a sophomore in high school is distracted, it usually means one thing. - There is this one boy. - Do your parents know about him? - Well-- - Hey, girl, stop right there. Don't do anything behind your parents' back, keep everything up front and honest with them. - Why do you say that? - Let me give you an example, what did we do today? - Hill repeats. - How many did we do? - 16. - And how many would you have done if I wasn't watching? - I would've done 16. - Would you really? Because I bet you could've been tempted to stop after the twelfth. - They did get pretty hard. - But because I was here watching, you kept going. - Right? - So, it's the same thing with boys. If you feel like your parents aren't watching, you might be tempted to do the wrong thing, but you don't wanna do that, you wanna keep everything up front and honest with them, it's the difference between doing 12 hill repeats and doing 16. (door creaking) Dr. Vann, please. This is Courtney Smith-Donnelly, I'm his daughter Katelyn's cross-country coach. Thank you. Hi, Dr. Vann, this is Katelyn's cross-country coach, how are you? Fine, thank you, I know you're busy, so I'll just get right to the point. Katelyn's not doing well. No, no, she's not sick. She just... She really misses you and I think it would mean a lot to her if you could make it out to her meet to see her run this year. Well, we've got one meet left and then state meet if we qualify. Regional meet is a week from Saturday. Oh. Well, like I said, I just... I think it would mean a lot to her if you could make it out once to see her run this year. Who do I think I am? I'm a nobody. Sir, I'm sorry I bothered you. Thank you for your time. - You wanted to see me, coach? - [Donnelly] Yeah, can you sit down for just a minute? - Did I do something wrong? - No, no, it's nothing like that. I just noticed you've been really hard on yourself in practice lately, you're running your splits faster than you're supposed to. It just kinda seems like something's wrong. - Nothing's wrong. - You see these eyes? They're 20-20. - I don't wanna feel this way, but Anna is better than me at everything. She's more popular than I am, she makes better grades in school than I do, she's better at running than I am. We've been best friends our whole life and she's always been better than me at everything. It's just getting hard to be happy when something good happens for her. I wanna be the best at something and I guess I'm trying too hard. - You know, it's funny you're in here saying all this because Shelby was just in here the other day saying the same thing about you. She's never beat you at running, you're more popular in school than she is, you make better grades than her. - Shelby? - Yeah, Shelby, why would she feel like that? - I don't know, that's so weird, I never knew she felt that way. Shelby didn't say any of that, did she, coach? It's stupid to be jealous, isn't it? I should just be happy for Anna's success, shouldn't I? I'll see ya in practice. - I'll be right there. - Thanks, coach. - You're welcome. Hey, Heidi? Can I give you just one other reason why you shouldn't be jealous? - Sure. - Because there's one thing that Anna or anybody else in the whole world is not better at than you. - What's that? - Being you. There's only one Heidi Olson and she was created by God and she is very special, she's so special. If somebody came in here and said, "I'll give you $500 for Heidi's uniform," would we sell it to 'em? - Well, yeah. - Yeah, we would, we could buy a bunch more with that money. If you said, "I'll give you $5,000 for Heidi's autograph," would we do it? Absolutely, are you kidding me? And say that same person came in and said, "I'll give you five million for your number two runner," I'd say, "No deal." Then he'd say 50 million, I'd say no, then he'd say 500 million, I'd still say, "No deal." He'd say, "How much would it take for me to buy Heidi Olson?" And I'd say, "There isn't an amount high enough," so do you see how special you are now and so is Anna and Rebecca and Katelyn and Shelby, all you girls are equally priceless, so don't ever feel like a secondhand anything. You may be the number two runner on this team, but you're not the number two person on it. - Thanks, coach. - I got your text, what's up? - Hey. Look. I can't see you anymore. - What? - I can't see you anymore. - Why not? - I just can't, my dad doesn't want me to date anyone. - Your dad doesn't even know me. - It's not you, it doesn't matter who it is. He doesn't want me to date and I don't wanna do anything behind his back. - Maybe it's time for your dad to let you grow up a little. - I am going to grow up. I'm going to do what he says. - What's that supposed to mean? - Never mind, I can't, so I hope you understand, and if you don't, then 10:31. - What, it's only 3:30. (birds chirping) (car rumbling) - Hey. She's almost done, her dad usually picks her up, is everything okay? - Fine, he can't make it today and she has a dentist appointment. - Oh, yeah, she told me. Well, I'll have her out on time. - Well, hurry, she can't be late. - You know, I played basketball in high school for four years and my JV coach was a yeller and he was always on us, he was very hard to please, but my varsity coach was the exact opposite, he was an encourager and a teacher and always cheering me on, I really liked my varsity coach. She'll be done in a few minutes. - Rebecca, did I ask you to do something for me? - What? - You didn't hear what I asked you to do after dinner? - Yeah, I was gonna do that after I did my homework. - I wanted you to do it then. - But I have this really important report that's due tomorrow. - You get out there and do what I asked you to do right now, young lady. - [Donnelly] And my JV coach was a yeller, he was always on us, he was very hard to please. - No, wait. I'm mistaken, finish your homework. - But I can do it. - That's okay, you have enough to do with running and schoolwork. Do your report. Rebecca, you've been doing really well in school, keep it up. I'm really proud of you. - [Savannah] I quit. - What? - I quit smoking. - What? - I stopped, no more weed. - Really? - [Savannah] Yeah. - Really? - [Savannah] Yes, honest. - What made you quit? - All of the sudden it just hit me that it's wrong, so I stopped. It's not what God wants me to do. Oh, well... I saved this. Did you really do this? Thanks. - You're welcome. - Hey, my lovely wife. So, I was online checking our statements and we got an airline bill, are you going somewhere I don't know about? - That, yes, I was going to tell you about that and I will explain later, I have to finish this first. - [Husband] And what you doing? - Comparing times to see how we'll finish in the regional meet. So, for state meet, it's divided into four regions and they take the top four teams from each region plus the top five individuals not in one of those teams. - Well, didn't our girls win at regionals last year? - Yeah, fortunately, there's not many good teams in the region. - Well, what are those times? - Well, I'm scoring the meet based on times of teams in other races to see where we'll finish. - I mean, if our girls won at regionals last year, don't they stand a good chance to win it again this year? - Yeah, but I don't want them to win, I just want them to qualify. Look at that. - What is it? - I want you to run the exact pacing that you have in practice the last two weeks, everybody understand? - [Anna] What? - You heard me. - You want me to run a 6:32 mile pace today. - Yes and just maintain it. - Coach, we'll lose. - No, you run your pacing like you have in practice and we'll get in. - Coach, we're not gonna make it to state if we run that slow. - You just leave the results up to me and run the race exactly like I've asked you to. Hey, remember the goal. And 10:31. (people cheering) - Pick it up, Anna. - Good job, you're on your way. Go, Heidi, stay on pace. - Anna, you gotta get it going, come on. Anna, you gotta get going, you're gonna lose. - Rebecca, you gotta go faster. - Anna, I kept telling you to pick it up, what were you doing out there - What place did we come in - I don't know, but you girls didn't make the state. - Are you sure? - Yes, now why weren't you running hard out there? - The coach told me to run her pace, I mean, what did you want me to do? - I want you to do what I say. - Dad, she's the coach, I have to do what she says or else I'm off the team. - Just quit, just quit the team, that's what I want you to do. - Dad, I can't quit, we still have the state meet. - You didn't make the state meet, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Your coach lost this for you, it's all her fault. This could've been a really good team this year. - Katelyn. - Dad. - Hey, I just got here, I'm sorry I missed your race. I'm really sorry. - It's good to see you, I didn't know you were coming. - Well, it was a last minute decision and I just wanted to see you run. - Well, you're out of luck, pal, try again next year. - That's two years in a row now I've missed you running, right? - Right. - Good job, everybody, good job, that was great. - Coach, this is my dad. - [Donnelly] Courtney Smith-Donnelly. - Jeremy Vann, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too, I'm glad you could come. - He just got here and he missed the race, he won't be able to see me run. - Sure he will. You girls take tomorrow off and I'll see you Monday. - What do you mean, we lost. - Oh, no, we got fourth, so we qualified for state. (girls laughing) - I'm sorry, but after this season, you won't be coaching here anymore. Now, this does not affect your teaching at our school. I hear you're doing a fine job in the classroom, you certainly are not being fired from your teaching position, but I heard from every parent this year and I mean, every single one, complaining to me that you wouldn't let the girls compete and that you made 'em run really slow. Now, I know we qualified for state, but just barely. One father tells me that if it wasn't for such a weak field, we never would've made it and we ranked last out of the 16 teams who qualified, last year we finished tenth, we had six of our top seven girls returning until you let the Sims girl go. Now, I really am sorry, but the decision's been made, it is final. The parents have all been notified and so have the girls. - Thank you for the opportunity to work with these girls, I've really enjoyed it. If you ever change your mind, I'd love to coach again next year. - What is it now? - So, you should be... - What happened to you guys on Saturday? How did you finish fourth in the region? You should've won that so easily. - We qualified for state, that's all we were trying to do. - Just admit that that coach does not know what she's doing. I mean, you guys are lucky to even be going to state meet with her. - Well, at least we're going. - Yeah, and look what you're ranked, last? You guys are gonna get killed next week, but if Holloway was still here, we would've been top five. Oh, but I do have some good news. Our track team is gonna be good hands and our relay team might have a legitimate shot at winning the state title, you know why? 'Cause we'll have a real coach coaching us. - [Heidi] Who? - My dad. He's coaching the distance runners in track, so this spring he'll have some real workouts to do. He's even contacted Holloway and he's gonna send the workouts to him. Well, good luck at state meet. (knocking) - What time do you leave tomorrow? - We get out of school at 11. - What's your itinerary look like? - Suppose to get there by three, coach said we'd walk the course, go over the race. - I want you to head straight for the lead in that race on Saturday, you understand? You could still probably get top 15 if you run your best. And whatever the coach tells you to do, don't listen to her, you're a good runner, she's doing a terrible job training you. - Dad. - Don't dad me, just do what I say. At least, we finally got rid of her, can't believe we let her stay around this long. - We did make it to the state meet. - Your team won the regional last year and you should've won it again this year. Look, I don't wanna get into this again, okay? Now, you have a good trip tomorrow and your mom and I will see you on Saturday. - Okay. (hopeful melody) - I was kinda hoping you wouldn't show up here, might have a better shot at this. - Okay, this is the starting line, we're starting out of box two. Let's walk the course, get to know it, then we'll go over what we're doing tomorrow. Here's the mile mark, there's the clock. Make sure you're on pace. If you're a little slow, pick it up a pace. If you're fast, adjust accordingly. The two mile mark. Check your splits again, you're two-thirds of the way home, the race will be won or lost in this last mile, I'll show you why in a minute. - Look at that. Do we have to run up that hill? - This hill comes just after the two mile mark in the race which is why in practice with your long runs, I had the hill come just after the two mile mark. The hill in practice is slightly longer than this one. Girls, listen up, at this point in the race, fatigue really sets in for a lot of runners and the reason why is that they went out too fast, so this hill becomes an absolute killer, but for you it won't be. Now, when you get to the top, you'll start working your way downhill towards the finish line, you have to stay focused, you have to stay on pace, you're still gonna have runners to pass in this last mile. Okay, let's keep going. When you get to this final stretch, you gotta give it all you've got, the downhill finish will help, but still you gotta run hard all the way through the finish line. There's the board right there. When you cross the finish line, your individual name will be on the left, team scores will be on the right, it's gonna constantly be updating as people come across the finish line and our hope is that eventually our team name's up at the top of the board. Remember, girls, cross-country lowest score wins. All right, I gotta get my wheel, meet me back at the starting line. - For a coach who lost her job, you'd never know anything happened. - Yeah, I know. I mean, did you hear what she just said about our team? - Yeah, hopefully at the top of the board? - I know our coach is a Christian, but she must be on some heavenly drug or something today. - Yeah, I've got a good pack this year, but I don't have a runner that can crack the top 10, that's what's hurting me. Now, you, you've got those two front runners, that's difference. - But anything can happen, we still have to run a good race. Besides, my three, four, and five are quite a ways behind. - They're not that far back. They'll be in the top 25, nobody can beat you. - Orange Hills is ranked last this year, is that right? They were top 10 last year and I thought everybody was coming back, what happened? - Yeah, I heard they got a new coach, doesn't know what they're doing. - Now, how do you know that? - We ran over at Jackson Park for our first meet this year and just got to talking to one of the fathers, you know he said that Sims girl, she's not running either. - That girl was good, why not? - I don't know. - Their top runner is ranked 42nd in the meet. - 42nd, they just be ranked better than that if they're all returning. - Gotta be that coach. - Who's the coach? - I couldn't tell you. - Check the roster, who's coaching them? - A Courtney Smith-Donnelly. - Courtney Smith, are you sure? - Says Smith-Donnelly. - Do you know her? - Yeah, I know her if it's who I think it is. Seven years ago, my number one runner, Shannon Wilson, was ranked first in the state, but she finished second at the state meet on this very course. You know who beat her? Courtney Smith. - Same girl? - She ran for Blair Academy on that side of the state. - Probably is. - She was ranked way back, like in the high 30s coming into the meet. She ran even splits, came out of nowhere, and ended up winning by four seconds. We never expected it. That's the team you need to be worried about. - Why? - Because if that girl is her coach and they run like she did. - They only have five runners listed coming in 42nd through 69th. - That's a pretty close pack. - Yeah, but they're way back. And my team will beat 'em easy. - All seven of my girls are ranked ahead of their number one. - They're not a factor. I gotta go, guys, but gentlemen, good luck tomorrow. Take care. - You, too. - Good talking to you. - I wouldn't be so sure about that. - What do you mean, look how low they're ranked. After our state meet, I remember checking Courtney's times in the previous races that fall and in every race, she was about a minute and a half slower than Shannon was. Until the state meet. - Well, what she do, run tempo pace the whole time? - It sure seemed that way. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, you're telling me that girl ran tempo pace in every race until the state meet. - I don't, but it sure seemed like when you check her times. - Well, how'd she qualify for the regional meet if she only ran tempo pace. - 'Cause that region's always been really slow, you know that. And I remember she qualified as the fifth individual. - You are kidding. She really did her homework. - Who's her number one runner? - Anna Glass. - What was her time at the regional meet? - 20:24. - That's about a 6:30 mile pace and what was her time at the state meet last year? - Anna Glass. 20:08, so she's worse this year. - Or she's a lot better and that 20:24 is her tempo pace which means tomorrow that girl's gonna break 19 minutes easy. - If she did that, she'd make top five if she did that. - With a pretty tight pack right behind her. - No coach in their right mind would ever make their girls run tempo pace every race, that is absolutely crazy. - Is it? I mean, what's the main goal here, to win a meet last month or win the state meet tomorrow? Think about it. We all do one tempo workout a week. If Courtney Smith had her girls run tempo pace in all the races, they did at least two some weeks, that's building great endurance plus they learned even pacing in race conditions. Yeah. If she trained her team to run like she did, look out for the girls in orange. - Here's the hundred meters. It's already marked with that white flag right there. Now, we're starting out of box two, so it's gonna be easy to see. Let's do some practice starts, let's get our pacing down. Girls, it is absolutely essential that you hit your hundred meter pacing tomorrow, does everybody understand? - Yes, ma'am. - What pace, coach, 24 and a half seconds again? - Not time time, Anna, this time you go out at 22 and a half. - That's a six minute mile pace. - And an 18:45 5K if you maintain it. You do that and you finish in the top five. - Coach, I haven't run under 20 minutes yet this year. - Yes, you have. - No, I haven't. - [Donnelly] Sure, you have? - When? - In practice. - When? - The cruise intervals we've been doing all season, remember we started with three and we worked our way up to five. Tomorrow, the first six minute mile you run is going to feel like the third cruise interval, the second is going to feel like the fourth, the last is going to feel like the fifth. Now, don't worry if there's a lot of girls out ahead of you at the start. It's the state meet, they're gonna go out very fast, but they won't be there for long. The field will come back to you. Just stay on pace and you'll keep passing runners. Same goes for all of you. What I just explained to Anna, that's how it's gonna feel for you tomorrow. - Heidi, 23 seconds for your hundred meters, 6:08 mile. Rebecca, Katelyn, 23 and a half seconds, that puts you at a 6:16 mile. Shelby, 24 seconds and a 6:24 mile. Every training session that I've done with you all this year has been to build your endurance and your strength to prepare you to run these times tomorrow. - Coach, why didn't you let us run this hard in any of the other meets? - Okay, I'll tell you. First, a lot of these girls are gonna be worn out from running so hard in previous races, but you girls, you'll be fresh. Second, I had you run tempo pace in meets to build endurance and that takes time. Third, I wanted you to learn even pacing in a race setting and that's gonna prove to be very important tomorrow. Anna. At the end of the race, there should be an Eastern Valley girl just ahead of you and you've got to beat her, okay? - Okay. - Remember, you'll be coming from behind, she'll just be hanging on. I would rather be in your shoes, but still you've got to get her. - Got it. - Same goes for you, Shelby. At the end of the race, there should be an Eastern Valley girl just ahead and you've got to beat her, understand? - Yes, ma'am. - You gotta beat her. This is gonna be a very, very close race, it could go either way. Okay. Let's go do our hundreds. - Coach, why didn't you tell us any of this before? - Yeah, and to our parents. - When I tell people to get faster is to train slower, hardly anybody believes me. Why, because that doesn't make sense. Most people believe the way to get faster is to run harder and that's what makes sense, but slower training builds endurance. Add in some hills, you gain strength, put the two together and you get faster over time, and that's what we needed more than anything was time. I needed every single training session I could get with you all and that included meets. So, if you girls stay on pace tomorrow, you can win the state meet. That was the goal, right? Remember the goal. I wanna thank each of you for the opportunity to be your coach this year, it's been one of the highlights of my life. I wanna thank you for your commitment to train every day, for your hard work, for your sacrifice, for not quitting, even when you didn't understand. And each one of you is so special to me. And my prayer for you is that God blesses you in this life. - [Dr. Vann] Dear coach, enclosed please find a reimbursement for the plane ticket you sent me. It should be more than enough to cover your payment. I didn't appreciate your phone call at the time, but now I realize it's probably the most important one I've received in the last three years. My daughter asked me what made me come to the meet last week, but I didn't tell her about your call and she was none the wiser, so that tells me you didn't say anything to her either, that was very honorable of you not to embarrass me like you could have and for that I say thank you. I'll be at the race tomorrow and more importantly, I'm going to block off more time to visit Katelyn in the future and make her a priority in my life. Thanks for all you've done for my daughter and good luck in the state meet, Jeremy Vann. - Anna, are you still awake? - Yeah. - Can't read, I'm thinking about the race. - Yeah, me too. - You nervous? Me too. You think we can win? - I don't see how we can. - The coach does, she really believes we can win. I'm gonna miss her. - Me too. (climactic melody) - [Shackleford] Congratulations, girls, you did it. - I can't believe you guys won. - Coach, where's the coach? - [Anna] I don't know. - Coach. - Coach. - Where is she? - [Heidi] Coach? - Where'd she go? - I don't see her. - What she do, disappear? - Wait, wait, I think I know where she is. - Where? - Remember that story she told us? She slipped out the back door. - [Girls] 10:31. - [Donnelly] Cross-country is a lot like life. You have to run a race with patience, with knowledge, and with understanding, and you have to remember the goal. Always remember the goal. The same is true in life. You have to learn patience, gain wisdom, and get understanding. Class, you have to remember that goal, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
