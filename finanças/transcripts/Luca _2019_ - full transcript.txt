A dear Mollywood fan 'Luca' Sir, that's Martin and Salomi. They worked here as servants, They saw it first. Please wait outside. Sir, you weren't supposed to go on vacation from today? Yes, I was on vacation. But Jairam Sir called in the morning, And told to come here .... The dead man is a popular artist, isn't he? Do you know her? A kind of sugar ... His name is Luca. I think it's been a month ..... As part of the biennial ... [Bainnal is the name of a festival] .... he and his friends organized an event. For which some people were annoyed. It also caused some trouble. Well. Police presence was required in that situation. I was in charge. How long have you been working here? It's been almost five years, sir ... We've been here since Luca's mother died. What exactly happened this morning? The door was wet when we arrived. Then I go to the kitchen and bring coffee. But sir was not in the room. .... and when I came here, I saw ... She heard me crying and rushed to the doctor. The doctor ... checks and says ... ... that Luca is no more ... The doctor was still there when we arrived. I have taken his statement. We can't stand it sir ... When we left yesterday ... .. I never thought something like this could happen. So you don't live here No sir, we live in a nearby slum .... A few kilometers away from the city. After making dinner every day we left. He would love to be here alone. When to come often? We would come around 8 o'clock ... He used to go out for cycling every morning. But if you draw overnight, There was chaos in his routine. While working, He would fall asleep wherever she worked. He would keep the door open .... If the door was closed, Then there was no other way to call him. What happened to Luca's parents and relatives? I heard when he was 7-8, Then his father died. She and him mother have been there ever since. The two were very close. A few years ago, his mother also died .... ..Because of illness ... That has a bad effect on her. He needed a lot of treatment, To be healthy again. Then Mr. Shivan brings us here. That's the guy who taught Luca to draw. I think it's because ... Shivan, a few other artists ... ..Kunjuman of our colony, His friend. They recently clashed with Mr. Sai Builder .... ..Which was trying to evict our colony. They went and painted our picture on the company's wall. .. which caused some problems. Since then, we don't think Luca is our enemy. There was a girl ... 2-3 months ago ... Her name was Niharika They loved each other a lot. We thought he would marry her .... When we arrived 2-3 weeks ago, The girl was gone. When we asked, Sir said she had gone back to Bangalore. After the girl left, It was as if he had really lost something ... When we were leaving yesterday, Many days later he looked smiling. His face looked bright, sir. Was there any other reason for this? Yesterday ... evening, when we were leaving ... .... a courier came. I think that girl sent something. You have to identify everything. Shivan, Niharika and Shri Sai Builders. Ok sir Yes, I have Fatima. You get ready Well, then I'm going. I have to go somewhere with Fatima. Do a thorough search. If you find anything suspicious, call me. Send the body for autopsy, Let there be a legal inquiry. If a relative comes, Be sure to ask, then proceed. Don't let anyone roam here. His paintings seem expensive. Once it's all over, Will seal the place, okay? I'll call you in the evening. We will discuss in detail tomorrow. Sir, don't forget about my daughter's birthday party. Will be leaving by 6.30-7pm. Well. Will remember Well. Sir. Jayaram sir. Sir. Akbar, how far is the work? I have started the preliminary investigation, sir. Aloshi will take care of everything for today. Ok Akbar. The media found out about this .. Before making news in their own way We need to keep an eagle-like eye on this subject. Tomorrow evening, we'll start again. Until then the postmortem report will be ready. Well, you go. See you in the evening. Ok sir Anthony, take their testimony and send it home. Ok sir Have you really thought about this? We usually tell those who want to be different .... Talk openly to yourself about this And see if the matter is settled. But there is no reason between the two of you. What are you thinking again? OK. If you are not interested, I have nothing more to say. No, we thought a lot about it. We are good friends and will not cause any problems. I will keep the friendship, even after the divorce. Fatima, you have nothing to say? As I said, The decision is yours ... As your lawyer, I can work ... But as a good friend .... I'm totally against it. Please file for divorce. You can go down. I'll be late for the night. Have dinner and go to sleep. Hi. Look who's here ..... Happy birthday Thanks. Can you get there fast? Why is it late? Well, the party just started or not? Doesn't anyone here have diabetes? I do not have Akbar thinks .... He's not as young as she looks .... You should have brought Fatima ... Dad, I have two cakes ... Eating cakes will make you fat. A child changes a lot .... Don't you think so? If they hadn't decided to adopt ... Today, she dies in the hospital. Broke down completely. Blood relationships are not everything. These three have proved it. The family is made .... Based on just that. Grape juice seems to be stronger than wine. Alcohol is not always needed to speak from the heart. Anyway, back to our words. Aloshi gave me a brief description. I gave such a picture to the media .. Those who contacted me yesterday. So, what does your initial investigation say? It's not clear to me yet, sir. Can't say the final word ... Until I get the postmortem result. That's what I told them .... When I was on vacation ...... My daughter came and asked about Luca He was a volunteer for the last bainal ceremony. He said Luca arranged everything, Which was exceptional. But I've never seen him ... In any social circle in our city. I think she did it herself. Yes sir. The people in his work said the same thing. The first thing that calls me ... He is Manoj of Haq Manorama. A few days ago, I saw Luca at the reception. He had her daughter with him. I don't know why they were there. I remember because .... Luca was really drunk that day. ... and JP was having a sip with Sir. J.P. Jaya Prakash. Who works for The Times ... Yes, he is. he's like a mentor to me ... That day, Luca was arguing with JP Sir ... Then they started pushing and shoving ... The girl who was with Luca ... She persuaded him and dragged him out. JP probably went crazy that day. I don't think it's related. According to work people ... His mind is very soft. But it can happen .. Let's see what the postmortem report says .. Get in the car. Sir? Get in the car. Sir. Akbar. Some things are in our hands before they are gone forever. When it's over, it can't be fixed ... It's only been 8-9 months .. You and Fatima were married, weren't you? I know the reason. What's his name? Janet. So you can't go with Janet ... Is that the reason? Sir. We decided to divorce after much thought. Need any other discussion? Yes, Akbar. It's not you Fatima anymore, Those in it .... Some of us met you ... Why don't you think that? I thought ... This marriage was a mistake. It wasnâ€™t Fatima, Amla or your fault. I'm stuck, And it's just my fault. Now we know the problem, Shouldn't it be fixed? Wrong .... Umbrella head. Not a single person, without memories .... Otherwise you have Alzheimer's. Life goes on ... Sir, to be honest ... Janet's memory is not my problem .... Why did she leave me ..... Or still with me. And this suffocating situation ... A different kind of pain. But when everyone said ... I hoped Fatima would give peace. But Fatima is not my solution ... I'm the big problem for him, sir. He needs to be released. She deserves a better life. Although, we're not a good couple, I will be separated and be like a good friend. My hair. A good partner is no more than a good friend. If you are old like me, then you will understand. There's no point in lying to a woman for hours on end ... But there is no end to the joy of talking to a friend for a few minutes. And ... Fathima is your best choice! Now is the time to forget Janet ... You should think about it. Good night sir Good night Well sir. All right. JP remembers, Did you mention that Jayaram? See ifshe's in town. If here, We will meet her tomorrow. OK. Come home tomorrow. Bye sweetie. Say bye mom. Bye. See you tomorrow. When the sky was pouring You too poured over me Season of dreams is here. Akbar. Janet. As the full moon is beaming in the sky Oh beautiful one, you are here beside me As the full moon is beaming in the sky Oh beautiful one, you are here beside me You stole my heartbeat You stole my heartbeat As the full moon is beaming in the sky Oh beautiful one, you are here beside me When the sky was pouring You too poured over me A house and a boy Enough? How about a girl? Amoment as delicate as music. Our hearts cuddled up in the mist. Love's tenderness will take over You spill life within, always As love sprouts inside .. Spilling nectar and sweetness around What happened? Nothing. This news has been printed in all the papers. What? I realized that Luca was popular. Sir, JP has agreed to meet us at 3 pm. Well, Let's go to Luca's house first. Tell Sudish to go there with Anthony, keys and files. Ask them to check the postmortem report thoroughly. Anthony, what happened to the postmortem report? It was not made, sir. The surgeon will bring it in the afternoon. Sir. 4 handprints were found. We got three matches. Luca, Marty, Salome. But the fourth is a girl's ... Most likely it's a nebula. Make sure. Hold it. Aloshi, I think this is the diary ... Came to the courier, which Marty and Salomi saw. Pack it. It will help us to fill the void. Well, I'll tell her ... Sir, the call came from the office. Jayaram Sir is asking, If you can go to the office at 12 o'clock ... Our forensic team will then get there. What time is it now? 11 o'clock Tell us we'll come soon .. Aloshi, you were talking about one of his events .. What was that? They made a joke 'Self-proclaimed God' He stole their clothes, Even underwear. He made a canvas out of it and put pictures of them on it. The exhibition also painted outside the gate. It was like urinating on them. Great. What happened then? They bought another underwear, what else? What did you say? After a while she shouted and left, sir. That's right. Give me the hat. You said you wanted to meet someone. Otherwise, I will send someone else to bring the report. I think we have something. Yes sir. There is something. He died of poisoning. It entered through the mouth. We don't have any samples of this kind of poison .. But, it looks like slow poison. Slow, but not overnight ... But, like drugs. Slowly it was given to his body .. And she died in his sleep. Smooth, exciting and painless death. I strongly believe it was suicide. Is that enough to come to a conclusion? No. Now let's come to the second formula. Luca was in the last stages of his life. He had only a few months left in his life. Something very serious was happening in his brain. Have you ever gotten the idea of â€‹â€‹having brain cancer? Yes. Its growth can be observed and analyzed .... For weeks he has been feeling the effects .... It may have been a month before she realized it. Possibility of suicide for fear of death. So, I think that's it. We can discuss it with the media. What do you say Akbar? Positive aspects have been highlighted in all the paintings in his house. So, I can't believe ... A person will end herself without a fight. Akbar, the surviving sick patient, A little more or less different from perfectly healthy people. Trying to understand the present by looking at his past is baseless. If you have nothing more to say, can I go? Yes doctor. Sir, this is the report. Thanks Doctor. Doctor one second. Was there any wound or wound on Luca's body? There was nothing fatal. He had a small healing wound on his body ... The body was where it was. They're not really blows, Small scratches. I can't say for sure before tomorrow. OK doctor. Thanks. What happened? Is something bothering you? Is there a problem with this theory? Not really a problem, sir. I heard from the people at work there ... When they were leaving in the evening .... They noticed, Luca looked happy after a long time. Not only that .... There was a girl who once lived with her. From then on I realized they were in a relationship. About 2 weeks ago ..... Suddenly the girl left the place. So, if we find the girl, I'm sure it will be clear. If you think it's necessary, Then do it. For now, I am sharing the details of the post-mortem report with the press. Otherwise they will deprive us of sleep. Let their brains work in it too. You can go Ok sir Yes. The girl that Manoj talked about ... Work people have talked about the same girl, right? Yes. Maybe we got some clues from JP. He said we could meet her in the evening. Is that so? Well, has any relative come to claim his body? No one came. I understand from this, He has no relatives. Even if there is someone, she is silent after seeing the news. Let's meet JP first. I'm glad she died. He took him (Nebula) away from us and killed him. She is the only reason behind my Niha Mar's suicide. I'm sure. Are you talking about nebulae, Was that with Luca? Did she commit suicide? When? It's been a week. It happened last Friday. Where? In Bangalore. In his house. Did you tell Luca about this? Why should I go? Who is she to me? Well. Well, Mr. JP ... How do you know the nebula? Mr. Akbar, Niha is my niece. My only younger sister's daughter. I raised her. Not as a niece, Like your own daughter. That devil's baby killed her ... We haven't been able to get out of that push yet. I have nothing to say about that bastard child. But, Neeha ... The name we used to call her ... Nebula Banerjee. Banerjee? Bengali name or it? Yes. My sister Jayasudha married a Bengali. Ashutosh Banerjee. He was a Bengali writer. In college they became acquainted with each other. Nihar died when he was 3 years old. There was an accident. After that they did not stay in Kolkata for long. Jayasudha got a job as a professor of chemistry at Philomenus College, Bangalore. They settled there. Niha grew up in Bangalore. He was of serious character. Maybe it was because of his mother. From childhood, His own world was education. Like his father. At the end of school life, His goal is to become an educator. Like him mother. Master, PhD ... Did you come to stay in Kochi for a while? No ... no ... Came here for some work related to PhD. The subject of his research was industrial chemistry. CUSAT University had 2 months of work. He stayed here. At that time she got acquainted with him (Luca) .... And one day, she left with him. Did she meet you after that? Were seen alone or together. Once you meet him, Tried to bring it back ... But .... She (Luca) didn't let her talk much. Took her away. Did this happen before the party at 2 o'clock in the evening? Yes. How did you know? During the party, we know about Luca and your inner fight. Did you see Luca and Nebula after that? No. I found out later He has returned to Bangalore. I think she finally understood who Luca was. But when she returned, And it was not like before. He always kept herself locked inside the house. And finally .... she .... How did she commit suicide? Ate poison. In the morning Jaya noticed that she was not coming out ... Then she went to check his room. He fell into a deep sleep Luca is responsible for everything, sir. That killed her. Calm down JP. I'm sorry for your loss. It shouldn't have happened. But, now we all need to accept. However, we will meet again. Because, you need help to solve the case. Sorry. No problem. Shall we go? Ugly Sir. Get the nebula's Bangalore address from her. Bangalore? Sure sir. This guy will be a nuisance to us. We do not have some network in Bangalore? Find the police station in that area based on the address. Bring the full details of Niharika's death. Now let's hear their story. Of course sir. Hey sir, This is the diary. So what was Luca's friend's name? His instructor? Shivan. We couldn't catch her. I heardshe's a vagabond .... And that construction company .... Mr. Sai Builders. Fix an appointment with the officer on duty there. No information can be released. Well sir. Then you continue. See you tomorrow. Well then. Sir came so fast today. Luca. I know you're upset. I'm in pain now, A hundred times more than your pain. First of all, you're not here with me. Also, don't let me be with you ... You forced me to leave. Exclude. You will love this gift with the letter. This is my diary, Which you have tried to read many times by stealing like a thief. I told you that day ... I'll give you this diary, When you qualify to read it. It's all about us, Just us. The first time we met, I was fighting with each other .... I felt curious .... I felt how much you knew me. I have been writing since then. Our mischief, Our fight ... And all the sharp brain work you do .. I am writing everything in it. Put your pain aside for a moment. And read everything happily. And look at it all again. At the end I think you can see me. Then come on. Whatever happens, The two of us will deal together. Niha. Hide ... Why are you grumpy You are an artist Should not be openly criticized. You're dirty today. But I understand one thing. Your mind is very soft. Show fake anger. There is a chance ... With which you and I can finally become friends. Look at that. That. A beautiful thing. Yes, that's right. Come on, let's go over there. I still don't want to get into it. It was a beautiful Sunday, And you decided to show me these wreckage and dragged me here. You said you're bored, aren't you? It's much better than shopping. If you are bored with all this ... Then I can go out and see the pictures. I don't understand these hanging balls ... And I can't understand the hair of the picture .... Spit What are these balls again? Don't judge so fast. I'm sure it has a deep meaning. Really a lot of bhangari. They could not draw a scene or Pictures of beautiful girls like us? It's a depressing thing or a nonsense. I can only see the two ends of it. What? Nonsense? Any idea how long it took to make it? Two months. Two months? For this? Exclude Fau. If you don't have the skills, Yes then maybe It took two or three months to make. Don't you claim to be an art lover? So you mean the depth? It's not something to be fed with a spoon, you know? Those who have time and curiosity, Only they come here. Itâ€™s not like fake intellectuals People like you who love to waste time. Then why aren't you kicking out such people? Of course so, Only prudent people can come here. Why are you showing such feelings? He pretends to be Goh or Vinchida. I don't know where to go. Dude, that's all there is to it .... Come with me I'm showing everything. Which text is causing trouble here? Hey, where are you going? I got sick fighting ... Get away. What's your problem, Patha? Everyone is kissing the ass of that text .... Share shit. If not, what can you do? Friend, move on, Let's see what we can do. What? I will talk You move away. Calm down. Hey. You go out. Who gave you permission to come here? Leave me We will settle the matter. Don't complicate matters by blowing your nose unnecessarily. Please leave. Please cooperate. Niha comes here once. What? Come on, I'll show you what I call two nonsense. Great. That's what I said .... You started trouble with her. But did you see she was right? A person with talent can never be so arrogant and rude. Oh, is that so? Remember, you worked hard anymore I submitted the research paper. And destroy all your advisers and say all this in vain. What to do then? I would kill her ... That's right. And that's what she did. Should I apologize? That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. But nowshe's really crazy. I think it can kill you. So no need. Hello. Hey. Don't we have to go? I have to catch the train today. Hey, you go. We'll see you next week. If we don't fix it, I will not find peace. We'll see you next week, okay See you again .... bye. Didn't you draw nude pictures of her? You are his big supporter? Shut up What's gone ... I'll be there. Sir. Listen. Hey. What do you want now? Actually, like a cup of coffee. What? Hey, chill. When you started screaming a little while ago .... Outside ... In front of the hanging thing. I know, I also said a little more. A little more? Much more. OK ... OK. As you say, I know nothing, No. There is interest in this matter. My friend dragged me here ... ... and thenshe's gone, He has to catch the train. Promise. I will never do that again. Sure? Will not come to such an exhibition, okay? OK. Also, don't say anything about something you don't know about. OK. If you comply, We can go for coffee. Well, all right. My name is Nebula. People nearby call me Niha. I came here for my research work. Luca. Everyone calls me Luca. Everyone near and far. This is my area. This is what I do. I'm really sorry for what I said. Now I understand how much time and effort it took to make it. Well. I have forgiven you. Hey, take it easy. No big deal. This is what I do to win the argument. Thatâ€™s true, but of an artist like you Should be openly criticized. No. That doesn't suit me. I am not an elite artist. The common local is an artist As you said a while ago, Mostly nonsense. So, sensitive to criticism. The aristocracy also gets angry. They tend to swell in the sleeves. And I do that outside. That's it. In addition, I'm a little grumpy. So I'm sorry too. "" A little grumpy "' That means so much more. Hey. How can I get back to the city from here? Oh yes. I forgot you are a tourist. If the bus stops, Have an idea where to land? No. Great. Anyway, I'm going out for an exhibition. If you don't mind, I can take you down the street. OK Hope you have the address? Yes. Inside the bag. Let's walk. Have you been here before? The wind and climate here are really great. It's Chill Beach. I did not go to any beach in Kochi. Sir, fresh fish of the sea. What did you do, brother? Don't buy if you don't want to, But this is the way of our livelihood. Will your livelihood push this fish into my mouth? Sell â€‹â€‹dead fish for survival, And then ..... When the fish is lifted out of the water, it dies. Do you have any idea how to sell fresh, Tell us. Why should I say? What's the matter Probably have allergies to dead fish. This girl, get out of here quickly. Its head has gone bad. What will you do Are you crazy or something? Why go there to behave in such a contradictory way? Did you see what she was doing with the dead fish? So? Is this the first time you see someone selling fish? Do not try to punish innocent people after exaggerating. So what is she doing? What do you call it? Get up. Isn't this JP's house? Dude, as I said before .... That I am very grumpy. Well then. Well. Niha. This is not your Bangalore. I am living a good life in this Kochi ... You can't go back and forth with these vagabonds. I don't need anyone's permission. So who needs permission? As long as i'm here Until then, I am responsible for you. If your mother calls and asks about you I also have a lot to say to my mother. I hope you remember everything uncle? Don't force me to say. Don't think that I forgot everything ... Mother told me to come. I'm here, that's all. I will leave here as soon as I find another place. It would be nice if you could leave me alone. Niha. Speak softly. Luca was right ... How many forms do you have? Today you are a whole other person ... The man who warmed his head on the first day is not. You feel very cold, sincere today. One who completely changed the character. But that's okay. I like all your looks. That night I thought, I got a friend ..... After a long time, I can call and fight. Today I think ... ..You are more than that. Someone will pull me if I fall .. Will you pick it up? In this article .. It would be nice if you could learn the meaning of art. Wow. Whether it is big or small from the place of exhibition. Shall I come? Or like that day, Tell me to come out? Of course not, Welcome. But don't say a word about what you see here. Agree? Where did you get my address? Actually, I need a painting. I remember my friend, that day came? Not finding anything that day, she went crazy. Because all the mess was gone, you know that. Really? So his birthday next week. I thought I'd give her a painting as a gift. But there are rumors that you are a very expensive person .... And probably can't afford to buy it completely. Anyway, that's why I came ... At least I'll give her your autograph. Interesting. Listen. Expensive? Don't spread these rumors. Maybe this happened. Maybe if you fall into big danger for this. What? We artists as famous lady killers. Especially when the artist is tall, handsome and single. Just like me. I came here knowing that you are not a saint. The day you dropped me off at home ... My uncle came forward and saw you. I have heard at least 10 lectures about you. Who said that? JP? Impossible. I just heard his murmur. Beyond that, she knows me perfectly. Maybe it's rumors circulating around us. Maybe. But I can say, He is an extraordinary writer. Compared to others, Something in his column .. ..There is depth Don't move. What? Stay straight. What? It is not necessary. What happened? If you don't mind, Can I draw your sketch? OK. But it will be straight. Straight. Stay straight. Done? No, we just didn't start? I have a sore leg. Stand up straight. I'm finished. If you keep asking questions like this, Then it will take a lot more time. A little more ... The face will not come before it. Oops. I put ink on my face. And hand here, okay. Done? Please be patient. It's over, brother. Wait, it's almost over. I'm tired of standing. I'm doing the last part. What's this? Why tears? Because you were crying. Me? When? I was laughing all the time. Weren't you hiding the tears from me with a smile? Damn ashes. Hey, this is not a copy-pasting of what is happening in front of you ... ..And not the color you show. I am interested in what lies inside. You weren't just smiling. Something big was going on in your head .... Your thoughts took you deeper. That thought came out of your mouth. But it was seen in your hands. Don't go deep with your thoughts ... ... everything from laughter will change. The face looked dark. Later it turned light pink. And then the terrible red. Your eyes were trying to keep yourself straight. They seemed to be slowly finding something. I could see your eyes were getting sick. But you didn't let it get under your mouth. And I just set them free. As I said, Itâ€™s not just painting. I find out what is hidden behind. Now tell me ... Isn't that true? If not, Say something. Luca, what did you say about my uncle before? I think you should bring her here one day ... .... and then you will draw his sketch. I think then you will see what is hidden inside. But she is the kind of actor .... ... will feed you Taski too. What you said is true. You already mentioned his name ... Didn't stop thinking about her. From childhood, Because of that I couldn't do anything. Luca. For a fatherless girl, Her mother's brother, not just Mama, Is like a father But it was not like that for me. To meet me and my mother ... One person used to come from Bangalore every month. Someone cared about us ... Someone good. Someone treated me like a father. But, somewhere alone ... His love was revealed, Change would begin. It took me a while to figure it out. But then ... How is his brother I did not have the courage to tell my mother. ..His best friend .... ..His guide ... He used to be rude to me. He, was the standard of his strength. Someone sacrificed his life for his sister and sister's daughter. What am I thinking? It took me two more years to understand that. I was being tortured for all this. One day she took me for a walk. I was scared. Tried a lot not to go. But the mother had to go to insist. My only hope then was, He won't hit me on crowded streets. We walked for a while, After that she took a turn on the road. He grabbed me tightly and dragged me down an abandoned narrow street. The narrow road ends in a meadow. Walking is the biggest road of my life. There was no sign of life as far as could be seen. I knew my heart was pounding. But nothing frightening happened that day. He knelt in front of me .... And she apologized to me for what had happened. He forbade his mother to tell her all this. Luca, that moment was just as confusing and annoying to me as it was this time. If it hadn't happened that day, Then one day I would tell my mother everything. But I knew a man like that, The little girl who begged .. ... his face went blank. So I will keep talking until I die. He is still my mother's best friend. The only criterion of his strength. Even after 12 years, He behaved as if nothing had happened. But I can't. Because I hate her. Because I hate her dearly. Hey wait Move. Wait. I have to go. You can go But come on in first. For what You know how I feel? Have you wondered why I came here after crossing so many paths? The things I didn't tell anyone, Wondering why I told you that? None of this I know. But I know you need to come in and see it. Leave Luca. Luca. Hey. I don't know how to comfort you. This is the only language I know. I have heard every word of yours. She was scared of you then ... That fear ... That was not your freedom? Thanks. Tell me now. Which painting would you like to give as a gift to your friend? Actually, there is no need for painting. I don't have many friends in this town. And then I met you. I thought we were both on the opposite path, I felt a connection inside us. So when I was bored, Then I made a story and went to meet you. I bought gifts for her before. Why are you smiling? Nothing. So i go Hey. If it hurts too much, don't stay there long. Pack your bags and go wherever you want ... There are many empty rooms here. I'll think about it. And if you're afraid to sleep alone, Then I can sleep with you. Don't mind. I can't think about it. Although you offered to stay, I didn't think of going. But as you said, It hurt me. And I could not see this irritation in front of my eyes. So I packed my bags and left. And the connection I felt that day ... No hostel could give me the security it gave me. But please ... For God's sake, do a little tidying up. How do you stay inside this ash-umbrella? Scatter everything. Like two and a half year old kids. Dear Marty brother, I have told you a thousand times .... ... clean the place or redecorate it. Where are they now, what happened? Looks like they're good ... You should explain this to your husband. You come in Who told you to do this? Why am I holding this? Who is that girl? How do I know? You don't know anything Come on. Then this is our room. What? I mean, your room. It was my mother's room. So this is the cleanest room here. You are everywhere in this room. Photographs are framed memories. That was my mother's theory. My father and I were good looking models then .. We were the biggest subject of his photographs. You were a little kid then? Of course. I've always been like a kid ... always. Leaving all the pictures in your eyes that picture was caught? Where your eyes are my honor and there. Go. And, why were you shouting at that guy .. Such talk is not right. Yes, I thought so too. He will do it again in a few days .. .... then I'll show you. Do you feel like laughing? She was trying to clean up. Madame Niharika Banerjee. Marty is a mess .... But, I kept my things in place. What? Like the place? There is nothing like that room. Everything is scattered. Like crazy guards. In chemistry, there is a rule for calling messy things. And that room is a perfect example. Going there to find something, Like going looking for a needle in a haystack. That may seem to you. But to me this is the perfect system. There is a beauty to chaos. Make it for me. Take, for example, our democratic India. Isn't everything chaotic? It is still going on. Baal. Not at all. Don't ignore what you don't know, madam. Look. Everything is absolutely within reach. But if you lock everything up, Then it will not be within reach. Suppose you look for something in this room ... You will find it easily. Need something? Tell me. No. No problem, You can say. Towels? Towels. Take this ... Comb? Underwear? Keep it. No please, no. Paint brush? Come on. Scissors? Small or big? Medium. Wallet? This is not a wallet. Pen? We use pencils, You can't find the pen here. With a pencil, you can delete and rewrite. Hey, the pen is gone. Mr. Shivan. Is your world tour over? That will never end. I changed the road a little to see you. Who is he? Oh, let me introduce you. This is the nebula. Not just nebulae. Nebula Banerjee. You can call him Neeha, But only if you can think close to her. He came to the university here for his research. Oh, is that so? Stay here for a while. No, please return my pen. Oh, I forgot to introduce her. This is Mr. Martin. I call him Mani. He's everything here. He rules this house. Heard the word? That's Salomi. Salome's wife Marty. That's right. Don't wait. My husband? That's right. This is Mr. Shivan. You can call it artist, activist, traveler. He is my guide, brother, friend ... Yes, that's right. John fights for survival, mother. Salomi. Yes. You eat coffee, don't you? Two coffees. Well. I'll have a cup of tea. All right. He forbade making tea here. I think only coffee can wet his throat. Even if they buy tea powder, He threw it out. Tea is for boring people. I'll make coffee for the two of you. Bring it out. Well. Let's go outside and sit down. Your family? They live in Bangalore. How long have you known him? Not for long. Like a few weeks. There are only ten people in his life, including me. And everyone knew her this year. And now she has put you in his life. But I'll only be here for a few days, Like a paying guest. He opened the door of his house for you .. So of course she is more expensive than a paying guest. I know her. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. Although she acts like a soft, funny guy .... He is weak mentally. Although for a few days .. You stay here Even then, there are some things you need to know. His mind is still filled with the terror of two deaths. She lost him father when he was 10 years old. This is the first time this has happened to him And fear entered his mind. Everyone expected, When she grows up, everything will be fine. In our country it is called incurable phobia. The death of anything, Even the death of an ant now afflicts her. And whenshe's upset, Then she looks at his words and deeds .. Who doesn't know all this about him, He sat thinking crazy. And his mother ..... The two of them were then ... And their fish formed a strong bond. But his mother suddenly fell ill. Suffered from unbearable pain for two months. And then she died. After his death she was sitting next to his mother. Did not attend the funeral. Locks herself in the room, He would spend hours after hours. Then a psychologist does him counseling session and treatment. Within a few days she returned to normal life. There is still anger over his life. There was a battle of death, And him parents took him away. But at some point, He has forgotten everything. And that is what made her a real artist. If you take a 5 minute break, It will not be a problem to save the world. Coffee break. Coffee is caffeine, caffeine is creativity. Who said these lines, sir? You. That's right. All true Hey. No, I'm leaving. I'm finishing the coffee. You come in. What's the problem? Come on in. Wait ... wait ... it's done. Don't go. Who is that? If I don't go now, My driver will leave me. The driver? Since when? Yes, new additions. Hey, I'm taking this lighter. Hey Neeha, see you again. That is Chekhov's book of explanations. A small book? I looked in the library. I'll bring it. Oh, all right. So you're a busy driver? So you do this too? Why not Eli inside? That's it. Is that so? He is very angry with you. Will you go Yes brother. I'm leaving. Don't be dragged like this guy. Tell me the matter? Nothing. Then why aren't you coming in? Hey, you talked about that tour program .... He's angry because you didn't do anything about it. Really? Is that your problem? Yes. That's it. You said our concert would cover the whole of North India ... ... and the whole band will practice outside. ... and this guy and his friends have no idea, With our stay, walks, food and everything else. Of course not. So? So ... Are you coming Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. Dear musician Suraj ... Is this the first time you're going to have fun at my event? No. That's it. Have you ever taken them on this cheap trip? No. So why are you killing this bal? What's up? This is not the local show we have done before. There will be a total of 10 shows in 4 states. Will be in cooperation with each other. An idea came to my mind. No train ticket book required, And I put them in the general compartment. Let them sing and dance And with the tips to make the show better. It will be 100% viral and will show in the news. You are an intelligent person. So you're not coming with me? Slowly, brother. Kick with love, it will start. Don't hurt like that. With love ... Love brother ... love ... Friend, don't you come to teach what you don't know? Oh, is that so? Hey don't forget my book. Chekhov. Like coffee? Come on. Judge your own misdeeds, don't you? But what you did in my book with your pencil today is unforgivable. Disagreeed. When you talk about it, I did not agree with you. Pierce your ears with a pencil. Turn the leaf over with saliva. Very hateful. I am happy for your talent. But you need to learn how to express yourself. Will it take all day to finish? It's almost aunty. Be patient He can't do anything, Sitting is wasting my time. Where is Kunjuman? Went to fetch water. I will leave now. Not done. I don't feel like my husband. You guessed it ... This is her. Take a good look. It's been 20 years since she died, isn't it? So shouldn't his age be like this now? Now look again. That's right. The age has become a little higher. Wait, I'm making you a little younger. You wait here, I bring rice soup. What are you doing, Luka? Can't see? Got it, don't you hate it? Hate to sketch? No, you're using a pencil to clean your ears. A pencil is the best thing to put in the ear. Ear murmur is a very bad thing, The ear rings at 12 o'clock This is your art tool. Honorable mention. Should be respected. Isn't it? So what happened? Good to use and also to find out something. When its tip becomes dull, we cut it off. Once finished, We throw it away. That's it. Not much. No less. I didn't want to hear the argument ... But, I mean, You should give it more respect. I understand, When it comes to respecting the work of art. If you say so, Then I need to show respect to my pen, pencil, brush, canvas everything. ... that's very difficult. For example, the book you are reading, It has value for content. The book has no value of its own. Of course not. Each book has its own entity. Didn't hear the words? A book can give life. A book can take life. OK. Tell me which page has this knowledge? Why are you spitting on my book? Spit and turn the page, that's normal. Yak. It is a hereditary custom. I spit and turn the page, which my father used to do ... ... my grandfather did, my great-grandfather did, ... and so did my great-great-grandfather. When I have my own baby next time ... They will also learn A, B, C by turning the page with saliva. Oh so? Now I understand, I don't mean to tell you. In fact, evolution has avoided your family. For this you do not know ... Does your mouth go dry when you talk? No, I don't know. When is spitting forbidden? You can put it on when it burns. Tell me what's wrong here? I did it to prove it. I didn't touch you. Give me a hand. Hurry up. Wait, I'll save you. Your hand? Hand. Water is not worse than my saliva, isn't it? Come on ... Catch me Looks like something is walking underfoot. Chill, I think it's a snake. ... I ran around the streets of Kolkata anonymously, anonymously. That vague scene is the memory of my childhood. Looks like a completely useless car ... ..Suddenly Kapuni started walking. Thanks. Welcome. Hey colors! Are you ready? Dawn is here. Hey colors! Are you ready? Dawn is here. As our eyes travel these roads Our shadows shower shade upon each other As our eyes travel these roads Our shadows shower shade upon each other It's like the stars above ..re-counting your tales .. It's like the stars above ..re-counting your tales .. The sly moonlight gently ..seeped into the dark room ..splashing light everywhere. Like the glazing sun The sly moonlight gently ..seeped into the dark room ..splashing light everywhere. Like the glazing sun Hey colors! Are you ready? Dawn is here. As our eyes travel these roads Our shadows shower shade upon each other As our eyes travel these roads Our shadows shower shade upon each other As the valleys below ..get moistened with fresh snow As the valleys below ..get moistened with fresh snow As you make your way ..with bubbling adrenaline ..kissing the new intoxicating waves ... ..that echoes inside you. As you make your way ..with bubbling adrenaline ..kissing the new intoxicating waves ... ..that echoes inside you. As our eyes travel these roads Our shadows shower shade upon each other As our eyes travel these roads Our shadows shower shade upon each other Sir. Dinner ready. Well. Coming. No need. We can avoid these too Fatima. I will eat out from tomorrow. Now I will Akbar? You can come through the window of my room. Fatima, you have completely changed. Didn't I decide to be a good friend even after separation? Didn't I say before signing the divorce papers? But you are behaving strangely all the time. We still haven't spoken well, Fatima. Look, I didn't hide anything from you. What happened in my life I made it clear to you before the wedding. Never insisted. I didn't think you should be dragged into all this. Believe me, divorce will be good for you. Would it be better? Can you swear from your mind? What are you doing for my own good? I signed those papers thinking of you. Only, think of you. Everything you say is true. He did not hide anything from me. I knew this marriage was a test. But, I still strongly believed ... I can get you out of this. But I don't think you want to come out ... Not interested. I know, To keep the memories fresh, the cat is still holding the picture. You love to live with memories. I have a burden on you. So this divorce doesn't help me ... ... a different path. Yes. Lights. I talked to Sai Sri Builders. The MD there is in Kochi today. He will leave for Dubai tomorrow morning. Will be back in a few weeks. The office will be in the guest house today. Asked to meet us tonight if needed more. Let's meet tonight. I will be ready in 10 minutes. Pick me up Matthew also called from the Karnataka police. Put it on the loudspeaker. Hello. Hello Aloshi. I saw the case you were talking about. Sure suicide. According to his mother, Going to his daughter's house in the morning, Found her dead. He ate some kind of poison without tension. I found poison stains on my body and a bottle in the room. Didn't find anything suspicious. According to the mother, nothing suspicious happened. In the middle of research, He suddenly moved from Kochi to Bangalore. He was already in a bad mood. Rarely left the room. We also took his uncle's statement. Before the incident, At the request of Nebula's mother ... He came to Bangalore. He spoke about Nebula's relationship in Kochi. Even if I wanted to know, His family has not expressed interest. So the investigation did not go any further. The case is closed. OK Matthew. That's enough for now. Well. Our doctor also told us to have the same type of poison. Yes. Also, have you noticed another thing? At the time of Nebula's death, JP was in Bangalore. But, she did not tell us the matter cleverly. When you meet her .. Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally? Not that. Something else. I'll tell you. Turn on the car. So you don't know Luca? Officer, got the news. I didn't know that Luca was painting on the wall. My team took that project by mistake. In fact, that painting gives us a chance to think again. We canceled the project. You may have heard the news. Now, our walls are one of the attractions of the city. You say, there was no investigation into the painting. Ashraf, take the bugs downstairs. Ok madam We thought of an investigation, Because the finger was pointed at us. And whatever I said .... The mistake that can easily get your claim denied is to fail. So the first duty was to correct it. As seen in the movie, We had no such bad intentions. Many times we have been favored by the media. Miss Cypria, when are you coming back? Madam, isn't it Jayaprakash? Yes. How do you know him? JP is a good friend of mine and well wisher in business. JP was in Bangalore for a while ... When his sister is standing there. I have known her since then. Are you also from Bangalore? Yes. I stay there most of the time. My partner is in charge here. That's the problem. Is that partner JP? No. Never. She is my best friend and well wisher. That's all. Well Miss Cypria. Thanks for taking the time. Sorry for wasting your time. No matter. I'll be back in a month. That's why I thought I would meet you now. Still, JP has connections. He is not alone .... Hey. Need a cigarette? No. What do you think? Nothing. One day, when we were talking about adopting a girl, Jairam Sir then said ... Blood ties are extremely expensive. What you read from that diary .. ..And the information that is coming before us ... Sounds the same. Seriously. When my daughter came into my life ... If his face looked dirty, a little ... ... if tears came to his eyes .. I would get really annoyed. We didn't know if he was in pain ... Or scared .. Or something bad happened. Fear and anxiety made our heads spin. It bothers me how a relative can do this to a child. Even if somehow, How do parents not know .. Ever read JP's column? Social Commitment ... My hair. Bad guy. Come on. See you tomorrow. Will we catch her tomorrow? So you're still angry? It's not time yet. Let me finish the diary first. What if a new character comes out? Anyway, I need to see her again. You go home now. Good night sir Good night Luca. Not everyone opens books like you. You have to understand that. I have a lot of respect and privacy. If anyone cares about this, I hate it, Even my mother. Diaries are personal things. But you started reading without asking me. I was not ashamed to catch you. Grow up man. Damn. Move. No, that's fine. No, cut off the hand, very sharp. Leave it, I'm doing. When did you come After a long time I was relaxing a little. Just arrived. The door was open too .... Suraj and his band have practice sessions and performances in Azrat. If you're free, let's go together. When? Must get out quickly. OK. Where the wind meets love. Where the sky dance like flames. You became my shadow You became my wings You became the shade in glazing sun. Do you feel alive inside? Has your voice woken up? Did your ember feel the heat Has your darkness faded? Do you feel alive inside? Has your voice woken up? Did your ember feel the heat Has your darkness faded? Do you feel alive inside? Has your voice woken up? Did your ember feel the heat Has your darkness faded? Where the wind meets love. Where the sky dance like flames. As the waves of dreams splashes on the shores of your eyes Here starts another brand new journey As new chains of words lights up the skies Spread apart those yesterdays with divine amnesia We'll take one step at a time And will change this world alone Will spear ahead like an arrow on fire Will dance the world around like a hurricane Where the wind meets love. Where the sky dance like flames. I didn't do anything that made you die. Come home from time to time. Do you feel alive inside? Has your voice woken up? Did your ember feel the heat Has your darkness faded? Do you feel alive inside? Has your voice woken up? Did your ember feel the heat Has your darkness faded? Where the wind meets love. Where the sky dance like flames. Where the wind meets love. Where the sky dance like flames. What is the name of the band "Cockroach"? They are very talented. They walk around like gypsies and sing. Where do they live? Our Birthday Boy, Rohan ... Most of them lived together in the orphanage. When they left, Shivan brought me here. They are all talented kids. They have lots of fan followers. They are going to travel to South India next week. Oh, is that so? In some respects, Rohan doesnâ€™t seem to have my advantage. Not that. A little weird, nothing more. But, no problem. He also has a story of losing a family. Another tragedy. What's the key? Which I saw hanging around his neck. That key is in this house. Thinking that there would be more people in the house, I gave her the key. However, they often came here. But after giving the key, They never came back. Well good night Hey wait Come to my room. There is a job. Really? I like to work late at night. Come on. Remember. Not what you think. So? What else to do? If it's cleaning, I can't. Getting too much sleep. Don't think that is not the case. So what I will say. Tell me. Did you read my diary today? Yes, I did. But I read a few pages. I will break my nose by punching. Diaries are my personal thing. Will respect. And not to mention. Never. All right. I won't even touch it. Look, we're good friends now ... ... and so we can share some personal things. But my diary does not fall into them. One day, when I think you deserve to read this diary .. Then I will give you this diary. What did you say now, you said thoughtfully? What? Can we share everything? So? So ... I'm sleeping here. There is so much to share tonight. So? Come on. Aren't you sleeping? No, it looks fresh. All right. Go and count the sheep and go to sleep. Good night OK. Kite. Peace. Peace. Hey .... good night. Oh god Get up mom. Help Something happened to Luca. What happened? Please come and see. Luca. What happened? What happened? I don't know what happened. Knowledge was lost. He woke up after sprinkling water on his face. What happened? When we arrived, she was out on a bicycle. Talk Looks like 10 minutes ago ... I was watering the trees. She came back excited. He put the bicycle down and fell unconscious. What happened? Are you alright Over there In the tree near the field ... Someone .. Fasi died. The tongue is out. People were watching ... Is she asleep? This happens often. Since his mother died, He is always scared. That's why Shivan told us to stay with her. Can you give Shivan's number? There are numbers. But she will not catch. Necrophobia is the fear of death or the things associated with death. Such as funerals, memorials, coffins, corpses. In this phobia, people are a thousand times more afraid than ordinary people. Patients suddenly lose consciousness ... .... shortness of breath, panic attack ... Removing these from the mind is the real cure for this disease. I taught her to sketch to remove confusion from the mind. He has a lot of interest in art, Which is like a good treatment for her. Art is the best therapy for the human brain. Scientifically proven. We did all this for Luca. Getting better, And then his mother died. It's not just necrophobia ... Suffering from Thanatophobia. Fear of death. Fear of death. With the death of the mother, Feel the handcuffs of invisible death on your side. Nothing incurable, But it will take time. I was scared to see you. Luca. You did a terrible job today. You shouted a lot, Which I didnâ€™t even tell my mom. You killed me. Hey, you go get the car, I'll stay here. Almost gone. I told you to park outside the hall. Movies and parking, I can't pay for two. On top of that, I can park here for free, Then why spend? The parking fee was only 5 rupees. If I watched 10 movies, it would cost 50 rupees, you know? We only saw one? See more? No. I can't walk anymore. I am very hungry. This problem, come on. Where? Feeling hungry? Yes. There is free food for you. Come on. Luca, where is it? Tell me where you are going. Come on. Sit down. We entered the marriage house? That's not right, But there is always something in this place. Free food. Free goods. Is that so? Eat. Smile. Run away. What if someone catches it? No. Boss here, I'm bringing food. Give food to two people. Take this. Nothing fried? Beggars can't like it. Eat what you get. Yummy. Yes. Delicious food. Hey. Mama is standing there. What should I do? Ignore. Hey. Coming here. Niha. Talking to you Alone. No, that's fine. I'll be right back. What the hell are you doing? Are you with that bastard? It is safer than your home. One peg. I haven't told your mother yet. Why? Why not? I will tell. Don't say another word. That is your mistake. I am not afraid of you, I hate you. Did you tell her anything? What if I say? How dare you? Leave. You don't know me well ... you ... Remove the hand from his body. Who are you to blow your nose about our family? Don't force me to talk about family now? Then I will do miking in a clear throat .. She is no longer the little girl that will play. Please hide. Stop. Let the world know ... What is the devil? Shut up Is it just him, or have you done that with more little girls? Please hide. Shut up Let's go Niha. If you have young children at home, Then be careful. Come hide. Keep kids away. Luca, try to understand one thing .... Not everyone is as good as you. You said something that I left out until I thought about it. You know how deeply hurt I am. Niha. Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person. You can talk normally .. But you can't expect that from me. If you don't pull, I would slap the devil. If anyone judges you by my words, It doesn't matter to me. See, she was treating you like a fool? I saw and hated. Not only that, I will hate anyone who looks at you like that. I know you won't be there after the research is over, you will leave soon. ..But now, you become one of me. Hey, you need to say something. I know it's not okay to stand outside the bathroom and talk. But safe, because you won't see my shame. I think I'm the first one, Standing outside the bathroom saying that. But not like I said drunk. Seriously, I need you ... It's hard to live without you. Drawing pictures, doing research and teaching children to read books with saliva will happily end their lives. ..Happy. That's enough. I love you Sit there and think ... I'm waiting. Thinking about age, Leave Aunty Salomi now. Money will not understand. What are flowers for? Selling at a lower price today ... So ... I thought .. Oh so? Do you need it? No. You can put it in a vase ... No. Take it? I don't need it either. Trying to be romantic? Yes. Shouldn't you get married? Really? Not that. The society has to be informed. Really? Luca. We girls expect a lot. Especially after falling in love or getting involved. Your offer was a little bad. Could have been more dramatic. And lots ... lots of romance. Luca. You are not a superhero. I hope so though. Because the artist inside you ... .... she can do more than any human being. When you get tired like today, Then try to do everything. I hate the artist inside you. Because I love your personality like crazy. Hey. Will you leave me one day? This is my only world. Where to go. I'll be here to pick up the dirt and draw pictures of them, As Salomi says. You're kind of crazy. You're more likely to leave me. But what do I do? Anyway, how far can I go? You can go where your mind wants to go. You can go to Bangalore with your mother. Or you can go to see my father in Kolkata. Once the research here is over, You can stay there. You can go wherever you want. Independently. But wherever I go, Will I ever find a safe place like your arm? Thinking about everything a little faster? Not that. Love is not planned in advance. When that can happen. Spontaneous. And, I know where you're taking this ship. And look, my feelings never fail. When proposing, Then I was ready to say yes. Really? Yes. Seriously? One minute. What? Where are you going? Coming. What is it? This is my mother. Don't be in front of your eyes, But I will always be with you ..... Promise. Luca. Where did you go? Shivan. Mom. Can you bring me a cup of coffee? This must be cut short. Are you still sitting at home? Do you know why Mani and Salomi did not come today? Do you know any news about Kunjama? What happened? Why don't you need to know what's going on around you? Come down quickly. I have to do everything. The people of the company came yesterday and asked them to empty everything quickly. They also brought a court notice. I don't know where to go. Didn't you say that talking to the company man would fix everything? Everything was going well, I don't know what will happen now. I can't think Kunjamma has done anything like that. He has already had two heart attacks. She has been waiting for him husband for almost thirty years. He has nothing but this house in the colony. Everyone's condition is the same. Shivan and Luca will arrive at the hospital soon. My husband built that house. Shouldn't I be there when she comes back? I'm not going anywhere. As per court order ..... ... tomorrow they will evict everyone from the colony. Everyone was ready to go ... ..But then Kunjamma jumped into the well. We heard screams and ran to the well ... But by then she had jumped. We thought she was dead. I did not wait a moment. I jumped and pulled her. You don't have to go .. Luca, you can come here. Tell your friends what to do, And tell them to do it. You're upset, Luca. Let's go home. Nothing happened. I'm fine. Why are you thinking so much? Luka is afraid of your condition. I can try to understand your social responsibility and artistic instinct. But you also have to accept that your mind ... ... these things are not strong enough to see. What will happen if you accept? Will I abide by these and hide? What do you think, these fake paintings of mine sell to the rich .. ... will I live a luxurious life? Do you think me like that I know you a little bit now. You will not do anything that ignores yourself. I know if you keep going But what will be the consequences. I'm not saying this to dream of an easy life with you. I'm saying this for your own good, Luca. So you don't have to suffer Your art is strong but you are not. Try to understand. You are not a superhero. I know. I know. When I was ten, Shivan has been with me ever since. When we are alone again, Then Salomi and Mani came into my life. You also saw what happened to Kunjammar, didn't you? These people have given fullness to my life. Whatever happens to me, I cannot ignore them as selfish. Do whatever you want Naturally, this is your responsibility. But know Luca, You are my biggest responsibility. I will go as far as I can to save you. I will never leave you alone .... I will follow you wherever you go. I know. These guys just have tonight. If we want to do something for them, We only have tonight. This What are these? Who are you Sir, come here. Where? Let's talk. Luca. What are these? Luca. Police. Enough is enough. Come quickly, let's get out. Get the bike, hurry up. Luca, they are following us. Don't worry. Luca, I told you not to get in trouble. Slow down. Luca. Please. Be careful. Niha. What? I can't see anything. What are you saying Stop the bike ... Open your eyes. Luca. Bring the report to my room. He has knowledge. Minor injuries, nothing to worry about. What actually happened? Luca suddenly said she couldn't see anything. As soon as I told her to stop, we fell ... I brought some sleeping pills. Let her sleep for a while. So she often had such difficulties. Let her watch tonight. We will do a scan and move forward based on that. The matter is in the news, isn't it? I saw a headline on TV. Have you tried calling any of them? We wanted to know the condition of the colony. Yesterday my phone ran out of charge. I'll call them as soon as I get out of here. It's terrible to sleep in the hospital ... Terribly cold and this annoying sound! My head is about to burst! We can't sit here long, okay? We'll be back as soon as you're well. How about when we run away? For what? It will be at noon, We'll go after that. What? What happened? Give the looker scan report. Not ready ma'am. The doctor asked to see you. Doctor? You are in his room. Okay, thanks. Except for the phobia you mentioned, Do you know of any other physical problems with Luca? No major problems, such as ... She exercises regularly ... Such as cycling, jogging So she is physically fit. Have you found any other symptoms of migraine? Or amnesia? Anything like that? When panicked, she sometimes loses sight. But without it, there's no problem ... He is a handsome doctor. Our senior cancer specialist. Seeing the name, she recognized Luca. He also treated Luca's mother. We found something on the scan. I called Dr. Sudarshan for a second opinion. What happened, doctor? What did you see? Luca? Why did you leave me? Don't you know, I can't live without you? Can you live without me? You said next monsoon, We soak together. Why did you leave me alone in that rain? It's been ten days, Luca. A few times I almost moved .. But if you close the door in front of me again ... I will not stay. You come here! I want to hug you tight. I want to pull that beard ... And I want to kiss you hundreds of millions of times! Isn't that enough to forget everything else? I know you will come ... I will wait. I miss you so much! Niha Cats? Cats Sir The cat ... Sir ... Sir. Sir, the cat ... Kitty? Kitty? Kitty. Kitty ... Kitty. Mom, That cat is dead, Wondering what happened ... The cat was probably upset too. We have to go to Fatima Hospital quickly. I need to see Dr. Francis there ... Ok sir Got my message? Yes. What's up with the band? Sir, I have contacted them. Says they're on their way back ... A South Indian trip was canceled. They are supposed to reach the city by noon. Arrived and asked to call. Did you sleep too late last night? Yes, it was too late. Did you finish the diary? Hmmm, let's just say ... Any formula ... I have more questions now than answers ... I read in the newspaper about Luca ... But the nebula ... It was a surprise, sir! Please tell, how can I help you? I realized Luca and Nebula were here ... What happened that day? They came here after a small accident Luca's mother had a type of cerebral cancer. Whose symptoms are caught too late ... Couldn't get treatment ... There was not enough time for treatment then. Why are we discussing this now? Unfortunately, the boy is moving in the same direction as his mother ... Perhaps, it is too late for us to catch his symptoms. In this case, there must be some symptoms ... Since she is a phobic, she takes it as a part of him .. was avoided. I mean, nothing like that happened yesterday. I know it's not fair to say that ... But there is no point in throwing stones in the dark ... We can test some more ... But all these symptoms to be sure. ... not recommending treatment ... That's right, doctor? Yes sir. Let her know ... No. Don't tell her ... In such a state of mind ... That seems right. I wouldn't even recommend it ... At least until the pain starts ... ... let her live in peace. I'll discharge her ... The rest of the reports will come in two days. Then we will decide on the next step. The autopsy report also mentioned cancer. Did any of them come here later? Luca never came later Nebulae used to come here often ... To take reports and other things ... A friend of Luca's came ... To ask about Luca. Doctor Sudarshan knows her. So we give her the details ... What was his name? One named Mr. Shivan. OK doctor. If you want to know more, I will call. Welcome. Things are not clear now, sir? Luca and Nebula both knew Luca was dying. Sadly, Nebula committed suicide ... Maybe she knew it ... ... or because of his illness ... Lukao committed suicide! Just because she has positivity in his work ... Can we rule out the possibility of suicide? There is one more reason not to think about suicide. According to the diary, his phobia was inevitable. How can a person who is afraid of death commit suicide? Looks like we're missing something ... Why don't we arrest JP and get the truth out of him? The only evidence we have against her is ... ... that event at the reception! Setuku is not enough. If we don't take any action against a famous journalist like her ... ... it will only add to the hassle! So wait a minute ... Let's see Luca? Why did you leave me? Don't you know I can't live without you? Can you live without me? Next monsoon, You said we would soak together. Why did you leave me alone in that rain? When you weren't by my side .. The wind blew without closing the door ... When the fog ignores ... Mango buds have come, this night of pure pain ... In summer, like dry river fish ... we are lost in the abyss .. Where are the moments stored at that time? In the distance, I see darker than darkness ... Everywhere I look I see you ... You are the fire burning in my chest, don't put it out like this ... I'm just a rising palla, Looking for your nocturnal flower ... Don't fade ... In the distance, I can see the darkness is darker than the darkness ... A smile is nothing less than a sea, because I am a writer of color ... .. Wherever the wall hits, I am your inseparable shadow ... I know you're right there ... Luca, I love you! That's why I'm leaving Sir, tea Need any chips? No. Do you know anything about this Shivan? Yes, I investigated her ..? I heard that she had gone on a journey somewhere before his death. They are trying to contact her. He can't be found on the phone As far as I've heard she travels a lot. Hello. Yes. Where are you Sir, they're the boys in that band ... They are on their way ... Let's go there and meet them ... As soon as we heard about Luca Sir, we canceled our trip. Rohan told us ... We only found out about the nebula when you said ... Isn't Rohan your keyboardist? Yes Didn't she come on tour with you? He was with us till Bangalore, then she got fever ... Things were getting worse, so we sent her back. So Rohan was here lately? Yes, but she was hospitalized. When I sent her back, his condition was very bad. Did Rohan say she saw Luca and Nebula? No sir. Some close friends ... Rohan was taken care of in the hospital ... They arrange the funding for the band. Luca doesn't usually get involved. He can't work with the hospital! Besides, Niharika and Rohan don't know anyone ... So she must have told me when I met her. Okay then, you can go ... So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange. If you want, call Aloshi .... Ok sir Suraj, don't you have the key to Luca's house? I need to see that The key ... The key? Sir, the key is always with Rohan ... It's a locket on his chain. As far as we know, that boy with the key is causing trouble .. We can keep an eye on her .. But I don't think she has any purpose. And although it's just a guess that ... Nebula's death is suicide ... In the presence of the same poison ... Both deaths seem to be the decision of the same man. Someone who goes after both places .... Which has access to both places .. He knows both of them very well. Are you here to interrogate me? Again for the murder of my child. This light? Don't even say 'my child' or 'my daughter'. What did you do to her as a child? He wrote it in his diary ... Do you know who you are talking to? This is light. Stop. Stand to one side. So JP, do you need an invitation to accept the truth? Don't waste my life, I'll tell the truth. Nebula, I have done wrong to him. For that, I also apologized. He never forgave me. But I changed. Maybe this change motivated you to kill two. Please believe me. It is true that I wished to get the nebula back, to kill him. But I never killed anyone. And, how do you guys think I did that? This guy won't take it easy. Let's go. JP, know. Don't get discounted so easily. We know how influential you are ... But, in this case, it can't be stopped. Believe me, I am innocent. One last question Mr. JP. Tell me. You can also lie if you want. Did you meet Luca after Nebula's death? To put it more clearly. On the night of Luca's death, did you meet him? No. The last time I saw her was at the reception. Come on. Sir, let's take her inside. Not now. I'll tell you. Don't you think that's the real guy? Nothing can be said for sure right now. If there is a connection between the two deaths, Then JP is the main suspect. The reason for being a suspect is that she has a direct motive. But we have no evidence to link her directly. She is safe until proven guilty. What now, sir? Those people of Shivan and Colony have to be interrogated. Then the decision can be made. Good night everyone. All right, sit down. Downstairs all day, sitting inside a closed door, feeling dizzy. So I thought I would come and sit here for a while. May I have some tea? No need. You sit Are you angry with me I don't know Akbar. Do you look very worried? Jairam Sir said, all your questions will never be answered. Isn't it ridiculous for a police officer to think so? I'm looking for an answer, Fatima. As you may know, the death of the artist Luca ... Yes, I heard about it. For the past three months, a girl named Nebula has been with Luca. One week before Luca's death, He committed suicide in Bangalore. There were very few people in Luca's life. You can make a story with any of them ... ..And they all have to have a good reason. But no one had proper evidence then. Maybe someone else ... But for now we have no such formula. Luca needed a painless death ... If anyone wants that, That, of course, is the nebula. If anyone wants to be free from cancer or phobias ... This is her. Someone died by hanging from that tree. ... his tongue was sticking out ... .... and people were standing around watching. He was not only necrophobic, she also suffered from Thanatophobia. Panic of death. Fear of death. The man died of poisoning. Please show me which page of the book has divinity? Why are you spitting on my book? I will go as far as I can to save you. The subject of his research was industrial chemistry. There is a saying in chemistry called keotic system .. And this room is a perfect example of that. With this letter, there are two gifts that will make you happy. This is the diary that you have tried to hide many times. You could be a good friend of mine. The day I first saw you You were very different from the angry boys. You seemed very calm and serious. It seemed like a long time ago, I got a friend to be naughty. Not just to be naughty, To pick me up when I fall. Not everyone is an open book like you. I'm afraid of you, Luca. You told the whole world what I didn't tell my mother You killed me, Luca. We girls expect a lot. It's more about love and relationships. Because I'm madly in love with your personality. Why did you leave me. Don't know I can't live without you. Said next monsoon we will soak in the rain together ..Then why did you leave me alone in this rain? It is not a common poison found in the market. Made in the lab. There are poison marks on the pages. The last three pages show more. Shall I tell a story? Yes. Once upon a time .. one was beautiful clay marble And there was a beautiful dry leaf. They were deeply in love. One day .. .. The two went on a trip. Suddenly a gust of wind began to blow ..And the dried leaf began to tremble like crazy. Then? What does clay marble look like? He sat down on the leaf. When the wind stopped, they started walking again. After a while ... It started raining in torrents. Now it's time to rescue the dry leaves. He flew away and covered the earthen marble. But, when they went further .. A thunderstorm appeared! Translate: KN Hasan Sabikunnahar Sonia Thanks Sub for enjoying the movie. If you like it, don't forget to rate the subsite.
