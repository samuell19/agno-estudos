I am sorry I am going to get a wall machine and pretend to knocking off the cement block With that noise They ought to hear miles away Why are you taking that risk? I know all the roads here And they know where I live If they are to force me giving up the field they will come sooner or later Farming is not going to make you rich Why don't you just sell the land Take the money and leave If we can go wherever we want to go Why did you come back here? Useless, speed it up Enough She's gone anyways Park the car in the parking lot I'll contact you after I've got the thing settled Croc... give me a hand here I have something to tell Chief first Wait, wait Don't bother him. He is taking a rest - Come give me a hand - Seriously, I have something... - important to tell him - I know, I know Help us with these first I know now who broke my arms It was City Councillor Ms. Shi Councillor Shi? Chief, I know who broke my arms now Their councillor looks very young She is older than I am Photoshopped and beautified Her mom probably wouldn't recognize her Your phone Field survey, remember? Not me Give it OK Act natural I think I'm okay Chief, biscuits Go ahead Can I? Of course Chief Liu, haven't seen you for a while How are you Welcome Thank you Sit, please Pardon me I have to rush back to the city council in 30 minutes And the trip takes about 20 minutes from here This is my assistant He is Croc Pleasure to meet you I'd like to bring to your attention There is a farmland in Councillor Chang's electorate that lacks water And the spot where the water is blocked is right in your industrial zone Yesterday, Croc found the guy who beat him That guy was at your service office And then? I think... he is probably some friend from outside So... is there anything I can do to help? Do you want me to catch the guy? That is a police job Why trouble you, Executive Assistant Indeed So you have reported it to the police? Young guys... just fooling around What's that to do with the police I come here today only to ask for your advice Please Was the beating your authorization? Of course not Well... and blocking the ditch... It also has nothing to do with your office, right? Of course Good Then I could rest assured to investigate fraud What? What fraud? What are you talking about? First of all I will urge the Water Resources Agency Pushing them to clean the blocked ditch and fix it If that doesn't work well I will ask the councillor to fire up in the city council Accusing the government of improper expropriation And if even that doesn't work I'll probably call on a group of farmers Telling the media of collusion between officials and businessmen forcing farmers to sell farmland at an unreasonable price Not only do I want that piece of land to have water Have my words that I'll keep it green 10 years from now Chief Liu, please, take a seat Here, have some tea You haven't tasted it since you got here Please Tastes good You can have mine There is plenty more here Please do let me know if you need anything else I want a piece of it, too How big would you like to have? Not much Half of it Chief This farmland... when it is developed whoever pays for as much of the land it all has already been discussed and arranged Half of it I'm afraid that it's not quite possible Well... Two-fifths are fine, then This piece of pie... Someone upstairs wants to have it too That's not something to worry about That woman... you gotta drive her out Remember how to do it right? "Insufficient storage space" Are you okay? This is a warning Have you offended anyone recently? These gunmen... they are nothing but expandables These young guys... they worship gang loyalty Who cares about loyalty and morality nowadays That doesn't last long Those who got scared away They are the lucky ones Those who keep holding on who cannot realize what he's doing is wrong who are still in denial They pay the price they cannot afford "Chen Calling" There is no factory built around here Why do they want to force me away If you know the reasons Will you leave? I will never give it up What the... Are you friggin out of your mind? Next time the bullet might hit you What do you think? Will the bullet hit me? You can import everything except for land This is what my father taught me Croc The P/E ratio is too high I would not buy this sort of stocks He is a friend of EA Chao We have met Hippo Croc I have something to say to chief Please leave I'll call you Let's have tea some other time I'm leaving now, Chief Okay Chief Miss Chen is going for reporters Chief, can we just let her go? Find some way to get rid of her No, I won't do that We all have our own worth A croc that doesn't bite Make sense? What do you want to say? I have to thank you... no matter what All this time no one really wanted to help me At which point would you give up this piece of land Let go Help Let me go Help Help Hello Hippo is dead What? I killed him And that woman? She's right beside me If you don't do it I'll send somebody else to finish it Whoever you send, they'll all end up the same What the hell do you want Mister Croc As before I will turn myself in But please, let go of Miss Chen It was their pie, and we took a bite without asking Now you want me to spit it out? Don't be kidding, okay If you don't let her go I will go to the executive assistant, the councillors I will finish you people off as many as I can How dare you, so you are the boss now, huh? I don't want the farmland anymore I'll sign whatever papers you want me to sign What? Hello? Are you crazy? For you, for this farmland My arms broken, I committed murder Now you're saying you don't want the land anymore? It is none of your business What do you want? Now... there is something more important than that I... Can't I have something more important now? Go now Don't get caught There is no irrigation water in my farmland Yu was the one who has been giving me the help I needed He was also the one cleaning up the blocked ditch Why would he shot at my truck? Miss Chen We have done comparison analysis The gun which put a bullet hole in your truck is the same gun that killed Hippo And both cases involving Yu, Da-Wei Has he been trying to warn you? To give up the farmland? Then why did he help me cleaning up the ditch? Has it ever occurred to you that he has other plans? Let's assume that Yu is a gangster as well And he also wants to drive you out of your farmland Sounds more reasonable, don't you think? Making sense or not, I do not know If it wasn't for Yu I'd have been drown to death now What have you been doing then? None of you ever helped with anything "Insufficient storage space" Not me Give it OK Give it to me Half of it is not quite possible - Well... - Chief Two-fifths are fine then I will turn myself in This piece of pie... Someone upstairs wants to have it too But please, leave her alone Don't touch her And don't touch her farmland Chen has already handed over the field Then please give it back to her Please Please leave her alone You just wouldn't let go, huh Please leave her alone Boar Have you done this before? Please, chief, leave her alone Boar Have you? Shoot him Chief I am a good employee You said that all documents ought to have backup I always follow your instruction As long as Chen's farmland is safely in her possession it will be well-preserved Chief I am Croc Once I bite I don't let go Oh no Boar Boar Miss Chen Hope this letter finds you well Thank you for the pork floss It is really good Autumn is coming You ought to be busy again Now your land should be a green paddy field Hope I could be there to be your helping hand Wish you all the best
