The audience is hypnotized... Fuck you, Mary. Hi, Aunty Mary. Hi, girlie. Grab your fancy lady-bag, we're going shopping. Ah. No, I'm okay, baby sister. Okay. You haven't been out for a month. I was hiking yesterday. I mean, out with people. Come on. Mary! Mary! Mary! Mary! Mary! Mary! Okay. Okay. I'll go get my lady-bag then. Your fancy lady-bag. Big shopping day, Ginger? We're not going into the city, just the village. But it's hard to scam 2x4s on the fly. So, anyway, don't tell them I sent you, but there's free 2x4s up at the arena, laying in the middle of the road. Definitely don't tell them that I sent you. Anyway, you're listening to 88.1 FM, The Rocking Bear on Bear Island, home of the bear. And I'm hanging in there, the Wolfman. Everything okay? Yeah. It's just strange sometimes, when I'm walking in the bush. Well... You've been in the city for a long while, it'll take time. You coming for dinner? No. Just no? I just need to be home. Why, you have a big, important meeting with a woodpecker? No. Well, just come for dinner. Can I get home before dark? Oh, Mary, you can stay out after dark. Just gotta get home. Okay, it gets dark at 6:00 p.m. We will cook, eat, and then we'll drive you home. Ooh. But it might be pitch black by then. You know, I want to be in my house before it gets dark. I got this process. Is it working? Not really. Uh-oh. And who said you could buy cookies? No one. Good answer, smart girl. Want to grab some toilet paper, honey? Might not see me for a while. Hmm. Hired Inez to bring me weekly supplies. You have been locked up all winter. It's not even summer yet. You're going to get bush crazy. Maybe. You don't like coming to the community? I just need to cut off for a while. You cut off any more, and you're not gonna exist. Aw. Hey. Oh! How are you? How are you? Good. Okay, here. Good stuff here. Here. Where did this come from? It was at the band office. It was general delivery. Ugh! You sure? What if it's money? I guarantee you there's no money in there. That's my ex-manager. Can't seem to give it up. Okay. Good job. I know, right? Yeah. I can get you more stuff. So you can plant inside for now, okay? Yeah? Yeah. Can you get herbs? Basil, cilantro. Anything. Yeah? If you want, I'll even help you. We'll make a really nice garden somewhere. Where shall we do it? Under where? I don't know. You know. Okay, well, you know what? Right there, I see it. Hey. Tell that story about that new RCMP officer on post. Okay. Okay. So, uh... That guy is real green. He's a real keener. He's only been here like a month. He lived up at the old logging post. Okay, so, old Peter, he shouts at the top of his lungs. That the RCMP should leave, and that he demands his treaty be honored. Peter pulls out his hands like... And the officer jumps, and he, like, goes for his gun. The officer sees he has no guns, and so Peter takes his no-guns and he puts them in his invisible holster, and he starts to chant. "Honor the treaties. "Honor the treaties!" Everybody starts to chant. That was so funny. That sounds like him. Then he got arrested for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. At the discount store in town, and they would have went broke, too, 'cause everybody started to ban the place, and then they put on this big sale, and issued an apology. And people started shopping there again. Yeah. It's like the only store in town. Is Ginger playing her guitar? Oh! Every day. She wants an electric guitar. Ugh. Really loud. Guitars should be loud. Hey, how's your grandma's hunt camp holding up? I'd like to say good. I told you it needed work. It doesn't really matter. What does that mean? I mean, it's okay. I don't even need anything else. We can help you fix it up. It's okay. I mean, I was just being... Ah. Fuck it. Oh. Fuck it. I'm okay, Betty. Fine. I tried. Why is everything my fault? Never mind. Fuck. Mary Birchbark, the icon returns. Albert. I ordered from Jack. Yeah, Jack works for me. Where you want this? Um... Let's just put it over here. Ooh. I'll bring the rest over next week. And it's good to see you. Hey, you want some water or something? I gotta run. Got a play tonight. Where? Community center. So, the kids thought it would be funny to write about around the rez in seven days. See you tonight? You know, I ordered this wood uncut, eh. Yeah, I had some extra time, so I thought I'd make it easy on you. I can still swing an axe. I know that. So, you might come? It'll be fun. You must first seek the road to camp. Yes, but where? North, young man. There you will see the birch tree, you must fight the fox and then you'll see me again. Yes. The illustrious Albert Acorn. You're too talented. A fun night, eh? Yeah. Good show. So, what was the inspiration for your character? Well, I have to thank Nokimis. She was grandmother to all of us, and letting me listen to all the trees. Mary, wanna grab some food? Mary? Are you okay? Mary. Go eat. Yes. Thank you. You were like 13 when I left. Bushman's little brother. Ah, I'm always the little brother. You know, Bushman followed everything you did right up until he passed. Yeah. I was really sad to hear of his passing. Diabetes. It really caught up to him. Yeah. How's your mom? She's still going to ceremonies, still beading, still going to bingoes. I really enjoyed your play. Sure has been nice weather, eh? Yeah, and they say spring will be short. I wonder. Hmm. Well, that's what they say, and I believe most of it. Excuse me a minute. That's $7 and 45 cents, exact. That looks about right. Can you get this man his order, please? Hey, you try the chicken fried rice? It's excellent. Yeah, I had some on order. Here you go. You on a date, man? Yeah, man. Nice. Oh, man, you know what I'm gonna do with this? Don't tell me.

That was you I saw getting water samples the other day, wasn't it? Yeah, I've been collecting water samples for roughly 15 years. Really? What are you finding? Arsenic. The mine won't clean it up. Pretty good second date though, eh? That was a date? Yeah. We still in March? Yeah, couple more days. I need to start planting inside. Jem says we're gonna have an early spring, but I don't feel it. Yeah, I heard that, too. What are your plans for the summer? Just keep breathing. Why? When are you going back to the city? Never. This is fun. I haven't been ice fishing since I was 16. You're never going back to the city? Yeah, never. Inez, it looks like you're the fishing master. Today. Two Shots will never believe it. I never catch anything. I usually catch everything. I even made some special lures for today. I guess the old ones worked better. Wait till summer. So, you're just gonna live in the fucking bush until you die? Really, Betty. You waited for that one.

Ex-manager? Yes. Mmm. Two Shots asked me to marry her. Congrats. Fuck, I'm too ancient to get married. You're not that old. Feels weird. I told her we should just live together. She's really good with the kids. Do you want to marry her? Yeah. I guess, kind of. Yeah? I just... Just never been, like, this good in a relationship. Kind of scared to fuck it up. Oh. How long were you married? Fourteen years. Fourteen years? Yeah. Fuck, it's hard, but sweet lying next to your lover. Just get married your own way. You must miss them. Fuck. Sorry.

Marriage is a beautiful thing. Where's your phone? No more, Keith. I'm done. Stop mailing letters. Stop contacting me. I had a feeling you were back on the reserve. We're done, Keith. Mary, Mary, I do miss that feeling. You remember that little bar in Berlin? That night we got all tied up on those bittersweet sippers. There's this promoter... Enough, Keith. A promoter, Mary. He wants us to open the festival in that little quaint town. Funny thing is, Germans dig Indians. I'm Anishinaabe, Keith, not Indian. Everybody loves Indians. Most just don't wanna see them have a home. Or a voice. Yes, yes, yes. Hey, remember you said you would come back? I never said that. Take a break, Keith. Go visit your family. Find some new clients. My hands are sore, my feet are sore. My mind's blank. No problem. I can make sure there's a massage therapist on the entire tour. No. No tour. Come on, you can still rock. Mary, we have one more in us. And I'll take care of you, kiddo, like before. I'm not your ticket anymore, Keith. I've left it all. I'm grateful for the time, but I'm happy here. All right? Take care. Fuck. Is that all right? Did you hear enough? Oh! Mary! Brooks. What you doing, man? Living, Mary, living. In my imagination, I dreamt of you. You were swimming in a great lake. Upstream you went, and we all admired your perfect form. Then you dove under the rocks, and came out at the root of an old white pine, miles away. It was sunny. Whoo! Whoo! Regrets. Regrets! Abandoned 102 years ago. It's all dead. For 102 years. "Private property." That's our people's land. It's not theirs to claim, never was, but the mess is theirs. When they abandoned the mine, they didn't clean it up properly. The tailings are old and the creek runs into the river. And the arsenic levels are rising. We need them to be responsible and clean it up. We're going broke on our end with the environmental monitoring, lawyers, consultants. Your donation to the library was very gracious. Did you see it yet? No Would you like to? I'm okay. Next time. Okay. Bye. Bye. It's time to warrior up. This is our land. This is our home. This is our land. Where are we fighting? Here. - What are we fighting for? - Our land. Yeah, this is our home. Our ancestors lived here. Our children live here. We need our clean water. We need our home to be good for our children. Yes! For Anishinaabe! We live here. No more mining. No more mining. Protect our waters. The police are coming. You think you can get everything? This is our property. This is our land. Not welcome here. Not welcome here. This is our home. What do you want? I heard you were all washed up. Excuse me? Keep your mouth shut. Tell the others, too. It was better when you where gone. Get out of here, go on. Tell Albert we're done. Get the hell out of here. The mine thinks it has ultimate power. I know. The Chief says she's gonna go talk to the mining superiors today, and she's taking the rez cops with her. Hey, I'm glad they're pissed off. Yes. I gotta go. I have to buy Ginger lunch. We ran out of everything this morning. I'll see you later. Okay. Who's there? It's Albert. Hey, Mary. Why is it so dark in here? Power's out. I haven't fixed it yet. Well, maybe I can take a look at the problem. I just haven't hooked up the new battery. This battery? Yeah. Want me to hook it up? No. No. You don't like the lights? You afraid of the dark? Thanks for the plant. No problem. Add water and stand back. I was thinking about you. You chew gum? Sometimes. Why, you want some? What's the deal you have with the mine? No deals. No back-room negotiating? Listen, Mary, I don't know what you're talking about. Company man came over here and said, "Tell Albert we're done." Fucking Brad. He thinks we got this friendship 'cause we played hockey back in high school. He's a terrible skater. Thanks for the plant. He's trying to get at us. Don't let them get into your head. Mary. Shit. Fuck. Hey, don't take my walker. No, no. Hey, listen thanks a lot, Jem. It was a real pleasure meeting you. Can I offer you some gas money? No, no, no. I tried taking him home with me. She found me walking the wrong way. Thanks, Jem. I gotta go. I don't want to be late for my yoga class. What a surprise. Yeah. Come on in. ♪ ...travel keeps you near This is exactly how you described it. Yeah. I'm fixing it up, bit by bit. It's good, it's cozy. Yeah. So, how you doing? Good. I'm in the middle of touring with The Radial Band right now. So, you were in Sudbury last night? Yeah. I took a little bus to a little town called Blackwood this morning. Waited around for a cab for an hour, and then I started walking. In the wrong direction. Yeah. I wanted to surprise you. And you sure did. So good to see you. It's good to see you, too. Ah... You still make me hard. Even in my moccasins? Well, especially in your moccasins. That's why I wore them. Oh, my goodness. You know I'm ready to go on the road with you anytime. Even ready to write. Thanks. I know. But I like it here. It's a great place. Want some coffee? No. Why are you sneaking around my backyard? You know you're more than welcome to come in the front door. What do you want from me? Excuse me? Why did you visit? I like you. And left that dress on my bed. What dress? The blue dress I found on my bed. I have no idea what you're talking about. Just leave me alone. Mary, I didn't. Mary. I don't know what you're talking about. It's happening again and you visited. What's happening again? Did you leave that dress on my bed? No, Mary. I bring houseplants, not dresses. Mary, I wouldn't do anything to hurt you or scare you. You know that. Let me see that. Thank you very much. Very good. You can see everything from here. This is my favorite spot. Have you seen a black, shiny car driving around here lately? For two weeks. Car looks like it doesn't belong. Just drives by real fast. Two weeks, huh? Man driving it? Yes. Kind of gray hair? Yes. My mum says you're all sad. And you can't play music anymore. She never even liked my music anyway, right? She doesn't like anything. Or anyone. She says you're trying to hide behind your failure because you can't make good music anymore. Wow. She's delightful. Not really. I like it when you sing. Makes my stomach go all funny. I'll see you later. He's after you, isn't he? I'm thinking he found me. He drives by after 2:00 p.m. Never seen him in the morning. What? Oh, hey. I'm just heading the band office. See if I can talk to the Chief. About what? Oh, some rez business. What's going on? Nothing. Come to dinner tonight. Maybe next week. You look like you haven't slept in days. You look tired, Mary. Are you really telling me I look tired? Am I rocking that worn-out look? It's not like that. You just look tired. I'm doing things. Well, for somebody who's retired and wants the quiet life, you sure are busy. I got no worries, sis. It's all good. I forgot my helmet. I'll see you later, okay? Kitty, kitty, kitty. You stay inside here, okay? You'll be okay. You'll be okay. Go away, Keith! We were good, now it's over. Just give me a second, Mary. Come on. I'm just talking about some benefit concerts, Mary. The indigenous community needs your voice. Just let me in, will you? If I can just... Listen, Mary. I think we could still work together. Keith, it's over. Just head home, don't come back. You really think you can finish with me this easily? I am not touring, I'm not playing, I don't need management. I can do everything myself. You fucking owe me, Mary. Fuck you. You were paid, and you were paid well. Forget about that. What about us, huh? What about our connection, Mary? You were my manager, Keith. It was business. We are fucking connected, Mary. It's over! Go away! Go home! Stop this bullshit, Mary. I know you, Mary. You got a whole album full of songs in you, don't you, huh? Look at me. Oh, please. It's a nice place, though. Quiet. Secluded. No one around. No one to hear. By the way, did you get that present I got for you? I didn't know if you'd like it, but it was designer expensive. Maybe you should try it on for me, huh? Fuck you. Hey. Hey. Come here. What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna be still now? You will come back to me. Huh? My head hurts. Yeah. Sorry I had to do that. Your bag's packed, we need to leave soon. I can't travel with a head injury. No, it's okay. I'll drive slow and careful. I have to look at my head. I have to wash. Please, I need water. I only did that so we could be together.
