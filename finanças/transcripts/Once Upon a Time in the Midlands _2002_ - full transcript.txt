WOMAN: It's like he's sort of going through a mid-life crisis but it's been lasting about 10 years. HOST: I mean, do you think he's actually got any musical talent? Well, I mean, he's all right. He can play the guitar a bit and all that, but he's so into country and western. I mean, it was all right when he was into progressive rock and everything. I didn't mind that at all, you know, but we're just so different now. I like Missy Elliot, I like Lil' Kim and I don't think Dolly Parton's had much to say for herself for a long time, you know? How are things between you, Carol, in the bedroom department? I won't let him in the house, so I'm not going to let him in the bedroom, am I? Well, if he's not even allowed in the house I reckon there's a great deal the two of you need to talk about. Fucking Vanessa. All right, I think it's time we welcomed Carol's partner, Charlie. [APPLAUSE] Howdy, folks. [***] * I am the Midlands cowboy * * I go from town to town * * I wear my boots and Stetson * * And the bad guys Wear a frown * * I sing my songs * * I right the wrongs * * I wear this great apparel * * Most of all * * I wanna sing About my love for Carol ** [APPLAUSE] Thank you. AUDIENCE MEMBER: I think he sounds a bit selfish, and I think you need to start taking on some responsibility, Charlie. How can you call me selfish? You don't know me. I mean, I'm great with my kids. I get them up, make their breakfast. I pack their lunch, take them to school. I pick them up, I bathe the lads-- But you need to earn money. What do you know about it? You've probably got no kids. Who'd want kids with you? VANESSA: Oh, I can't have you... I can't have you insulting my audience. CHARLIE: Well, she's insulted me. VANESSA: I hope he doesn't talk to you like that at home, Carol. CAROL: No, no. Fuck, Carol. Don't get me wrong, he is a good dad. He's the best dad in the world,you know? I've got my daughter, Donna. He's not the father of Donna, right, but he took me and Donna in when she was a little girl and all that, and he's an absolute diamond and I love him. I've been with him all this time... Bad sister. but the thing is, I'm sort of getting to the age now that he was when we met and I sort of think... You know what I mean? He's going backwards and I'm trying to move us on... Charlie, man. HOST: Well, you say he's a great father, and as it so happens, we've got your best friend, Shirley, her daughter, Marlene, and your older daughter, Donna, all waiting backstage. Come on out, girls! [APPLAUSE] Oh, fuck. Hi, girls. Welcome. Shirley, you're Carol's very good friend. Do you think... I mean, there's obviously a lot of love going on here. Do you think they stand a chance of making it together? Um, I don't know. I think they're both a bit mixed up, really. Ah, baby. You think they're confused? Yeah, a bit, yeah. Not as confused as you're going to be, Shirley, because... Could we dim the lights, please? We've got a surprise for you. Where do you think your boyfriend Dek is now, Shirley? Um, he's waiting with the car. You think he's waiting with the car. You're entirely wrong, because, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome Dek! [APPLAUSE] SHIRLEY: Oh, my God! Fanny. What are you doing? Oh, God. It's been a year and a half now, Shirley, that we've been together. What are you doing? Oh, my God. Shirley, you're a better woman than I could ever be. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] No, than I could ever be with. You're a wonderful, fantastic mother. You're beautiful. I love your hair and your little hands and your eyes, both of them, and... you're a role model and an idol and you're something to gaze down on like a... like a piece of nice art... Oh, God. and I hope you'll make me the happiest man in Britain today by saying yes when you ask me to marry you. Dek, I can't believe you're doing this now. Yes? Yes, Shirley. Yes. Yes. Please? I can't, Dek. No. There'll be more Face To Feltz after the break. Fuck it. Fuck it. No, ta. I got her to sign a T-shirt, you know. I was singing on the TV show when Shirley, she said no. Stop it. It's not funny. Watch my bloody hat. Come on, Dek. See you, Charlie. You all right, Marlene? Yeah, I just feel a bit sorry for Dek. Don't be daft. You didn't do nothing. I did, Mum. I helped him write that poem. Marlene, why didn't you tell me? I just wanted people to think I'd got a dad. Hey, I really like Dek. I know you do. It's just not that simple, you know? I know. I know what you're doing, talking about me. Can we talk, please? I can't now. I'm late for work. Don't go off like this, eh? I can't fake it, Shirley. You've wounded me. [MARLENE LAUGHS] See, I'm a laughing stock, aren't I? No, you're not. Yes, I am, Shirley. Yes, I am! Come and sit down, please. Sit down? Sit down in my own house and be laughed at? No way, Shirley! I'm going to work now. At least thereI'm going to get a little bit of respect. Have a nice day. Emerson, put these on him. Boys, are you in that bathroom yet? Come on. You better be in there, you know. Not this again. You little buggers, what have I told you? I've told you time and time again, don't be doing that. Otherwise I'm going to send you to your dad's, up to the pit. [MOANING] Come on, you've got to get up. I can't take much more. You should have put a lock on the door, shouldn't you? They can pick the lock, Carol. Phoar, it stinks in here. Come on, get up. I want to put this duvet cover in the washing machine. Oh, no! Oh, Donut, where's the back of your knickers? No, stop! Look at that, look at that! What's going on in here? Donut, how could you? You can fucking have him! I knew you fancied him. Get in there. Get in that bathroom. I love you. There's only you. Are any of us in the paper? No! Is that you, Texas? Yeah, we're working Saturday, okay? Yeah, yeah, the old colliery club, yeah. No, they've put their money down a few quid, but apparently they're not doing much business since the pit closed. Okay, Texas? See you Saturday, kid. Yahoo! Get off the car, Donut. Lean against the wall or on the curb or something. Don't flipping flop all over the car. You know the rules. I've got things on my mind, Dek. So have I, so have I. Don't slam the door. You ever worn a thong, Dek? * They're on the road again * * They're on the road again * [HONKS] Fucking brilliant, eh? Did you feel the brakes on that? Hey, you forgot something. How was it in the back, Billy? Superb. Weren't it comfy? Aye, great. That's real mock-leather, by the way. Is it? Yeah, and did you open any of the presents while you were there as well?

Yeah, so how do we go about this now? Do we... Is it I talk and you listen and then you... When I stop, you tell me what's wrong with me? Okay, then shall I start now? Come on, Jimmy.

We don't blame you, though. He's not a patch on your last fella. We were saying, weren't we? Yeah, it's not really your business, is it? Oh. Well, excuse me for breathing.

Hey, come on, there's no need for that, Dek. Well, he's her brother, Charlie. Yeah, well, he's her ex as well, in case you'd forgotten. Did you know about this, Shirl? No. We should call the police. He's probably after Marlene now, ain't he? This is my brother we're talking about. He's only your foster brother. He could have Hannibal Lecter's DNA strands for all we know. You bastard. Don't you dare say that. Get off. He bloody gets on my nerves. Out of order there, Dek. You're out of order. Welsh wanker. I blame it all on that bloody Vanessa bloody Feltz show. Should never have gone on it. They never tell you that's going to happen when you go on. You turn me down, and that just leaves the door open for him to come walking back into your life, don't it? Now look what you've done, eh? You all right? Yeah. Do you want to watch The Weakest Link? Yeah, go on, then. According to many people, the secret of successful entertaining is being in control. Do you reckon I could have him, Charlie? [LAUGHS] It's not funny. Lads at work said he put someone in hospital when he was 12. Is that true? Look, it was just all schoolboy stuff, wasn't it? I'll go and find him, okay? No, don't go, Charlie. I'll cook you some tea, mate. It's crispy pancakes tonight. Charlie? Jimmy. [***] [WOMAN ON TELEVISION SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [FOOTSTEPS] Shirl?

Yeah, I know, I've seen it from upstairs. What a way for you and Dek to meet, eh? Unbelievable, man. So, what are you back for, Jimmy? Should never have went away, Charlie. Biggest mistake I made in my life. Don't be soft, lad. You were never happy down here. I was never happy anywhere else, was I? I wanted Shirley to say no... when that fanny asked her to marry him on the telly. Is there nobody who doesn't watch that bloody show? Big chance for me, Charlie, man. Last chance. I'm going to lose you next, aren't I, Shirl? Oh, what are you saying things like that for? It's true. Why is it true? Hmm? Because Jimmy's back? Says more about what you think of me, Dek, don't it? Why do you think I'm going to want to go back to him? He's like this... big mystery. Like this Zorro figure waiting in the shadows, just waiting to pounce on me. He's like a virus and I can't breathe-- Hey. Hey, stop it. Stop it. I don't care about Jimmy. He left us, Dek. I'm with you now. Okay? Okay. Okay. Come upstairs with me. Yeah. Yeah. You want an M.O.T.? Mm-hmm. Full service? Oh, yeah. Respray or... [CAR HORN HONKS] Who's that? Don't know. [CAR HORN HONKS INSISTENTLY] Shirley... Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God.

It's got to be in the arm. Well, do what I'm doing, then. This is what you're doing. This is what he's doing. No, he's not. You're just being mardy because you're losing. Ah! Cancel it. Cancel it. It's gone. Cancel the game, that doesn't count. You've pulled it, man. You severed something from the bone. He's only 17. He hasn't been in a serious car accident, has he, Donna? Neither have you. It was only a bump. It was a near-death experience. I had a car door this far... this far from my eye. My eye, Donna. If it wasn't for my... my guardian angel over there, I wouldn't have pulled through. She's pissed, isn't she? She is pissed. We're in a new phase now in the relationship, and I don't mind her being pissed. It's just another quality, isn't it? Of her, of Shirley. [SONG ENDS] Thank you kindly, folks. That was a request for Jeannie there behind the bar. Shirley, my arm. Shirley, careful, darling, please. Shirley, stop it. Come and have a dance, Dek, together. Shirley, don't. Oh, come on.

I know it's your birthday next week, but this is an early present and I'd like you to open it now. My granddad gave it to my father, and my father gave it to me, and... Dek, it's a man's watch. Yes, it is a man's watch, Marlene. The Queen gives her crown to her sons and it passes on down the family like that. It's... It's a heirloom. A heirloom, they call them, and, um... I'd love you to have it. You do like it, don't you? Yeah, I love it. It's... silver and stuff. Yeah. [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] It's like the crown jewels. I'd best be going to school. Oh, all right then. Bye. Tell the time. I will. Hey, baby. What are you doing here? Look, I don't want to cause you any trouble, Shirley. I know Marlene's birthday's coming up and I didn't want to miss it. Well, I am going to miss it-- I'm going back up the road-- but I just wanted to make sure she got her presents, you know. Are you going back to Glasgow? Aye. All right. Mad the other night, eh? Hmm? Yeah, I was a bit drunk. I felt something. I thought I felt a wee... thought I felt a wee something, you know? Thought you felt something. A wee something. You must think I'm really stupid. No. I'm with Dek now. He's great, and Marlene is great. You know, it's really great. I saw you turn him down on the telly. I'll make sure Marlene gets these presents. Between you and me, I uh... think he was knocking her about when they lived together. No. Oh, aye, yeah. Well, you can tell, can't you? You know, terrible. So what was the crack then, Boss? What kicked it off? Oh, well, I went white. White. You did not go white. Donut, I know what color I was, and it was white. How do you know what color I was? You were down the hall, dancing like a little girl. So come on, then, Darkus. What happened, man? Yeah, what did you do, boss? I didn't have to touch him, did I? When you're like that, when you've got that... I just walked across the hall. There he was by the bar. Stood. He's only down there. He's only that big. Yeah, tiny little thing. And you didn't hit him? Didn't have to hit him. Didn't have to hit him. It's all in the silence of the... of the... Zen, isn't it? Come on, he used to be solid. You're telling us he walked? Well, he might have been solid when you knew him, but he ain't solid now. He wasn't solid when he was faced with me, with that whiteness. I'd have given him another five, six seconds, and it would have, you know... The whiteness would have gone to another color. You know, I'd have gone... Ha! You know, and pah, pah! Boof! You should've done. Isn't it? I mean, I could've done, couldn't I? Hold on, hold on, hold on. [DRILL WHIRRS] Oi, Jimmy. Hey, Jimmy. What are you doing back in town, Jimmy? Welcome to hell, Jimmy.

Sorry to interrupt, boys. Can we have a word? I'm all ears, Jimmy. No, in private, man. A private word? Do you want me to come back? No, no. You stay there. I'll have a word in private with you. Would you like to come through to the office? Think we should... Do you think we should go and help him out? Tea break, mate, isn't it? Yeah, it's not really the time for it, is it, really? Go on, then. Say it. Say what? Sorry. What do I need to say sorry to you for, you fucking fanny? Well, maybe... Maybe you shouldn't apologize to me, but you should apologize to Shirley. She's frightened to death of you. You've really scared her, Jimmy. Now, I don't know what happened in the past between you and her, but I... I think you used to knock her about. [DRILL WHIRS] It's going to get really nasty in here in a minute. Look at the state of you. You're not even half a man. You think I'm going to let you take my Shirley away from me? Are you fucking joking? No. I'm going to take you right out of the picture, and it'll be before you know it. All right, Tex? Hello. Scotland? Scotland! Oh, sweet mother of God. It's happening. They're here. Oh... Where's my suitcase? What? [WHIMPERS] Dek, what are you doing? Just take the kid and go! Dek... what on earth are you doing? Dek, what are you doing? Go to your room, get under the bed, and stay there. Is this a joke or something? No, it's serious, Marlene. Go, go, go, go, go! [DOORBELL RINGS] Hiya. Me and my pals, we're down here looking for a mate of ours. He lives... In fact, I think he lives here. His name's Jimmy. Jimmy? Jimmy. Aye, we're friends of Jimmy. Sorry? He said we're great pals of Jimmy. Well, I know it sounds a wee bit weird but we heard he was here-- I've not seen him. Not for three years. Now, if you don't mind, I've got to go and see to my daughter. Well, maybe if he's passing, you could give us a wee bell, eh? [THUMPING] No, get out! Jimmy, you wee bastard, you! My daughter's there, you bastards! Have you seen somebody called Jimmy? Come on, Marlene. Come on. Downstairs. Jimmy! You wee bastard, you! Jimmy! He's in here! Jimmy... Out. Now. I'll count to three. One, two... Okay, okay. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Who are you? Derek Slater, 98 Second Avenue. And what the fuck have you come as, you big streak of piss? [LAUGHING] I'm looking for Jimmy. Jimmy? You seen him? Not here, no. So you have seen him? Not... Not here. Now, don't fuck me around. Sorry. [WHISPERING] I've seen him in town. Where? By... By a river. Are you taking the piss out of me? No. I'm a civilian. Look, just leave your number and I'll get right back to you as soon as I hear him or see anything of him. I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise. You'd better be straight with me, pal. Please don't do anything sexual. Come on. Hey, Billy. What? Can we go see The Tales of Robin Hood? Can you fuck... Fuck that. I'm starving. I know. They've got medieval banquets up there. Who stole this fucking van? Ripping legs off of chickens and stuff. It's absolutely brilliant. I tell you, Jumbo... I said, who stole this fucking van? Here you are. Have this cushion. No, no, I don't need another cushion, darling. You'll be all right. I don't need another. You'll be all right. Take it away. No, look, it's in my throat now. I can't breathe. Listen. I can't breathe. Take it away. Put it there, then. Put it there. That's it. Leave it there. That's it. Thank you. Oh, that's... That's quite nice. Here you go. Thank you, darling. Right. Got everything you need now? Yeah. Yeah. Do you mind if I go out for a little bit? Where are you going? I don't know. Just... get some fresh air and stuff. You know, it's been dead weird today. Hmm. Do you want me to come with you? No, it's all right. I'd quite like to be on my own. How long are you going to be? I don't know. Just... not long. Are you all right? Mm-hmm. Okay. I love you, Shirl. [HONKS] Oh, my God. What? Dek, Baby's back. [WENDY RENE'S "BAR-B-Q" PLAYING] Whoo! * I smell something In the air * * It smells like barbecue... * Whoo! That one. Do that. [CAR HONKS] * That barbecue... * Go on, do it again. All right. * I smell barbecue... * * You smell barbecue... ** Shirley... talk to me, baby. Shut up. What are you here for really? I told you. I tried to tell you. Why now? Because I never really ever wanted to go away. I was too young. I felt too young. If I'd have stayed with you, we'd have ended up splitting up anyway, baby. You didn't stay to find out, did you? No. That's why I'm here, babe. I think that you and me should be together. I absolutely think that you and me should be together and I want it back. I want it back. Hang on, we're spinning, we're spinning! Hang on, hang on, I'm on the grass. Come on. Hang on. Shirley... I've not got any right to ask you for anything, darling, but if you feel anything at all, if there's anything left at all, then tell me and I'll fucking hang about here, you know? I'll hang about here forever. I think you know the answer to that one, don't you? Oh, God, I'm confused. I know. Oh, Jimmy. I missed you. I'm sorry. * Baby's the best car On the road * * She's the best car On the road * * She killed an old lady And a toad ** Can you all get out, please? Come on, Dek, mate, let's just go. Please. Please, just get out. Come on, you two. I don't have to go, do I? I need to be alone, Marlene. Yeah, but are you going to be all right? Please, Marlene. Please, darling. Dek, look at you. You're in a right state. Please. See you later, then. Hello, it's me. The bloke who fell out of the airing cupboard. Listen, I know where he is. I know where he's stopping. No, don't you dare come around to my house. I don't want this linking back to me. Can't I just tell you? It's really easy to find. No, you stop playing games with me, mister. Sorry, sorry. Well, I don't... Okay, okay. Flipping heck. I'll meet you at dawn, but I'm choosing the rendezvous. [KNOCKING] All right, all right. I heard you the hundredth time. Jimmy, answer the bloody door, would you, lad? Jimmy? All right. Who do you think I am, Linford Christie? Milk? I get mine from the shop, thanks. What about a yogurt? Or spuds? Is that you, Dek? No. Fucking cracker, Billy. Where's Jimmy? I know he's been staying here. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know... Want some more? what you're talking about. Okay. Fuck! Fucking hell! Take him out, Billy. Take him out. This has nothing to do with me! It's nothing to do with me, is it? Get behind him. Get behind him. My foot! My foot! Take a look upstairs. Here you are, babe. Oh, ta, love. Do you know what? My bloody foot's throbbing now. Aw. You all right? Yeah, not bad. Bloody hell. What a fucking mess. So, where were you, then, Jim? What? When all this was kicking off. Where were you? Oh, he'd just nipped out, love. Nipped out? What, half past 5:00 in the morning? Where did he nip out to? Tell her about Dek, Charlie. Huh? Oh, just forget about all that. Tell her about Dek. Tell me what? Fucking Dek grassed us up, all right? He saw him standing outside when they arrived. Oh, Dek grassed you up, did he? I don't know whether he grassed him up or Dek was with them when they came to the door. I'll deal with that streak of piss when the time comes, but, the point is, they were looking for you, weren't they? What the fuck are you getting at here? Aye, they were looking for me. I didn't smash the house up, Carol, okay? Dek fucking grassed us up. It's his fault the place is smashed up, not mine. Well, of course it's your fault. See? See, it's always the same. Every time you come back, you bring trouble with you, don't you? Every bloody time. Look at you. He don't care. You're like a little... What's that word? He's immature, isn't he? Like a little kid. Well, I've had enough, Jim, all right? I've really had enough now. Coming around here, always causing trouble on my bloody doorstep. A few fucking tapes, man. A few tapes? There's some originals there. He saved up for 10 years for all that. A lot of shite. Bloody sent to Nashville for some of them. Do you know what I mean? You've broken his bloody heart, but, of course, as long as it don't affect you, it don't matter, does it? You don't give a shit about anyone but yourself, do you? I don't want it no more, Jimmy. I tell you, I'm fed up with it. What? I don't want you 'round here anymore. I don't want you bringing trouble to my doorstep, all right? Have you got nothing to say for yourself? What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do? I want you to go, that's what I want you to do. Well, it's not your fucking house to tell me to go, is it? Yeah, but I'm still married to him. I still care about him. He's the father of my bloody children. What if my kids had been here? I mean, you might not give a shit about your kid, but I care about my kids, but you don't think about that, do you? Because you're stupid. Fuck off. No, you fuck off. Go on, get out. I'm sick of the sight of you. Don't look at me like that. Why don't you just go? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you'd better pack your bag and I think you'd better get off, mate. Yeah, thanks, Charlie. Thanks, man. Pathetic. What's that? What's that when it's at home? Fucking that's what it is. That's what it's about. Right, that's what it's about. You thieving. Aye, fucking... I'm trying to better myself, ain't I, Carol? Better yourself? Oh, lovely. What are you fucking complaining about? You've had a touch out of this bag as well, and him. Oh, lovely. We ain't seen him for years. We get a little present off him, and that's all right. You're mad in the head. You're the fucking one that's mad. You're the one that's mad, going out thieving. I'm supposed to be your brother. Brother? Then act like it. I've looked after you all my bloody life. I'm fed up with looking after you. When have you ever fucking looked after me? I've looked after you for the last 20 years! When we were 15 years old, I was the one that stopped you putting needles in your bloody arms. Ilooked after you. 16-year-old with Donna. On the fucking street like a stupid wee lassie. I was the fucking one that took care of you. You were around for two months, mate, and don't you dare bring my kid into this. Go on, why don't you piss off back to Jockland? You're a fucking disgrace. You're an idiot. Fucking disgrace? I'm fucking ashamed to call you a sister. Fine. Don't, then. You know, I live without you all the time, baby. Don't make no difference to me now, you being here. So that's it? Yeah, if that's the way you want it. I don't know. Hello? What are you doing? I thought you were in work. I didn't go in. Nor me. Where have you been? Oh, uh... out and about. I just came back to get a few things together-- I don't want you to leave. I don't want to leave. Please don't go. I'm not going to leave. I just think... I just think you need some... time. Some space to think things through. I'm so scared, Dek. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. I'm so scared. Shh. Oh, Dek... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot about you. I'm sorry. No. No. Dek, nothing happened. Nothing happened. I can't, Shirley. Nothing happened. I can't. I took them to Charlie's this morning. Who? Those men who were after Jimmy... I showed them where he was. Oh, my God. Carol, stop it! No. That's enough. Bollocks. He deserves it, that poxy grass. Carol, please. You see the state of Charlie's place? Well, he deserves it as well. You come anywhere near me, you numbnut, and I'll knock your fucking block off! Carol, listen. Anyone get hurt? We're all hurt, Shirley. All right? Get away from that window! Get in there! That's it. I've done my bit. Done my bit. Get away. [DOOR SLAMS] No, I just... I just think you should just go, Dek. I've just had enough now. [CAR STARTS] How are you getting on there, Wordsworth? Not bad. I've got the, uh... who it's by. I just made a name up. What's the name? Roger Myers. Who? Do you have to talk so loud? I'm watching telly. Kids by Roger Myers. [LAUGHS] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hey, babe. Is he in? No, he's gone. Where is he? I don't know. He's... He's left. What, gone gone? Yeah. Jesus. They just fucking turned their backs on me, Shirley. Carol, she's thrown me out. She went fucking ballistic. Went crazy, threw me out. You can't stay here, Jimmy. You can't stay here. Baby, come on, I'd wait 1000 years for you, Shirley, but I'm in a bit of a spot. You've got to go. Baby, look, all I've got is the gear on my back. No, just don't, don't... don't, Jimmy, please. Man... Look, babe-- You have to go. Leave. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to go back to Glasgow? Babe... what do you want me to do? FEMALE ANNOUNCER: ...overlooking Les Baux-de-Provence, regarded as one of the most beautiful villages in France. Marlene, it's time to come home. Can't I stay here tonight? No, I'd like you to come home, please. She's all right. She can stay with me. I don't mind, Shirley. No. I really want you to come home. Go on. See you in a bit. See you later. See you, darling. Goodnight, love. Yeah. Baby. Ah, she's dead delicate, ain't she? Who's delicate? Me. Jimmy. Marlene, your dad's come to stay for a bit. Speak to him, please. Please, Marlene. No. Marlene, please.
