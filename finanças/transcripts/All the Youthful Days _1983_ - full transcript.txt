Minus four points. For which one? Minus four points for whom? The fourth one. Minus four points. Who is it? I'm wet all over! Who is it? Not the Piggy. What? Heads starts from the right. Tails starts from here. What's the bid? This is Hsiao-ling's... $110. That'll never get it. Keep opening them. This is Ah-lien's... NT$48. That'll never get it. How can such bids ever win? This is for interest. Like grandma. Hsiu-chuan's... NT$250. With that bid she'll get it. NT$250. Are you planning to run off with it? You going away again, Ching-tzu? No. Can't you get out of the sun? Don't you know to move a little? Come on! Hurry up. Close the door, Potato. Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing? If you can't buy a ticket, get out. Damn! Black and white? Why aren't there any porno shorts? You took it, hand over the money. I didn't take yours. I took from №4. You picked it up from №4. - I didn't. - Yes, you did... from №4. I picked up from №4. From №4. - No! - Yes. I picked up 6 from №4. You picked it up on me. - I didn't do it! - You did! I didn't! - Give me the money. - It wasn't me. Give me the money. I told you, it wasn't me. Wait... Gambling again! - Over there. - Where? That one. It's this one. This one? Why'd you cheat my nephew? What happened? Somebody beat you? No... got hit by an oxcart. Feed the gruel to your father, Ching-tzu. Don't want to do it, eh? Run around outside all day long. And played poker-face once you come back. And you can't do anything at home. All you know is arguing and fighting. And this is the way you act at home! I didn't lie. Little Tsai told me. Everybody at school knows. He said an oxcart hit him. Nonsense! An oxcart goes too slow. It's impossible. Your brother punished Wang Ta-ming. His brother has a lot of friends. And even the teachers daren't touch him. But your brother did. So he was beat. Which one? Those two. Where are you going? I didn't do it. Ah-jung, where are they from? I don't know, the dock I think. Be respectful, Big Head. Poor Ah-yu. They broke two of his ribs. Seven or eight against just him. What were you and Ah-yu doing that day? Nothing! Ah-yu told me about my brother's fight. A bunch of them came in two cars. Seven or eight men suddenly came out of the cars. All I could do was run. But Yu was beaten. I took Kuo-tzu back to look. They'd all gone. Ah-Yu, too. The cops were just at my house, too. It's lucky I ran out first. My uncle has an empty house. It has been empty for over a year. They all went to Taiwan. Would you like to go? Is this livable? It's like a haunted house. Any electricity? Yes. My father comes once a month. Really run-down. Look! Kuo-tzu, come out here. Look. Oh, that one... that's my cousin. Your cousin? Yes! Lin Mei-chuan. - Really? - Really! Lin Mei-chuan! Mei-chuan. Mei-chuan. Mei-chuan. I'm your cousin's friend. Me too! Me too! My cousin? That's right. Kuo-tzu. - That one. - It's him. I don't know him. Kuo-tzu! Come here! Hurry up. She said she doesn't know you. I'm Kuo Wen-Hsiung, from Fengkuei. My father's Kuo Ching-fu. Aren't you Ah-yu's daughter, Mei-chuan? No, I'm Yang Chin-hua. Yang Chin-hua... Hey, Ah-ching, let's go to Kaohsiung? I heard that Rong's sister is doing well there. Maybe she can find us a job. Aren't you due to join the army? What the hell. I can't just hang around here. Hsiao-hu. Aren't you from Fengkuei? I came here for a change. Ah-ching! That's Wang Ta-ming's brother. You're Wang Ta-ming's brother? Hold the head higher. You need to pick the feathers from the neck. How can I cut it this way? Hold the head up higher. Higher. Can't you do it? Go ahead, cut it. You're too slow! Hurry it up. - Cut it, and let the blood drip. - Bring Potato more life. Cut it deeper! Deeper! Let the blood drip out. Drip! Drip! - Where's the blood? - Being a chicken is no good. - Why isn't there blood? - You cut it wrong. - Cut it again. - Give it another slice. How can I do it this way? Higher! Hold the head higher. Put the head behind its wings. Throw it on the ground to die. It doesn't seem to be very dead. It crapped. Don't let it get away. Stop it. Give it another swipe. It's salty. Make a toast to your cousin, Kuo-tzu. Just a minute. What're you doing? What're you doing? Drinking. I didn't bother you. Hey! A fly! - Why did you hit her? - You're a bother. I just hit her a little. You treat your girlfriend better than your friends. Ah-ching, let's play the hand game. - Why'd you do that? - He's always that way. Cheers, Chin-hua. I don't drink. You drank with him. Why not with me? I'll drink for her. Don't be that way! Bottoms up. I drink for her. He'll drink for me, okay? Okay, bottoms up. You can't be this way. I'll drain it. That's the way I am. You didn't buy my soda. Sorry. Stop that! Take it easy. Put a thumbprint below your signature. You too. You. Fighting around at your age! Fight, and your brother bails you out. Your brother had to bail you out. And you have to pay medical expenses. Quiet. It's not your business. I wish they'd lock you up. The sacrificial paper's all burned, Mom. Okay, you can clean it up. You just had no upbringing. You aren't a child anymore. You shouldn't give Mom so much trouble. - Why don't you be quiet. - You're telling me to shut up? You were fighting with hoodlums. What if they come after your brother? What should you do then? If they come, I'll kill them. You won't kill anybody. Ah-feng! Bring the medicine! Hurry! Bring the medicine! Does it hurt? - Well? - No answer. What'll we do now? We'll just go over there. She lives on Hohsi Road. My older sister said it is Hohsi Road, Kaohsiung. I think it's the Kangtu Theater bus stop. Why don't we take a damned taxi? Did you burn your head? It would take us for a ride. A bus is safer. Made a mistake. Sorry. - Which bus is it? - I thought they all went there. Only №48 and №88 go there. Wrong! Wrong! He said only №88 goes there. That building's great! I'll live there. Where will you get the money? This looks like it. This is wrong... Kangtu Theater. I don't see any theater. Hohsi Road's over there. That's it. Must be there. No. That's it up ahead! Come and look. No, the west is over there. Where's Hohsi Road, please? It's above there. Come see a show, young fellows. Come on, it's great! What's it about? They're factory girls. NT$250. No, thanks. What did he want? Who is it? It's me, Sis... Ah-jung. She doesn't let me smoke. Ah-jung! What are you doing in Kaohsiung? I came to find a job. You can see Love River from here. It looks pretty. What a stink! Smells like Ah-jung. - Really. - Like you. Get serious. Mom called... Why didn't she tell me? I didn't tell her. She said you were taken to the police. You broke somebody's head fighting. You want to be a hoodlum? What kind of job do you want? Where are you going to live? I'll go to a factory. A factory! You think it's that easy? You have an army obligation, and no skills. Didn't graduate from high school. You're just hopeless. Scalawag. Come. I used to live here with Mei-ju. Huang Chin-ho lives opposite. I arranged it with him already. You two go find him. Oh, yes. The bathroom is downstairs. Over there. Huang Chin-ho lives there. Got it? Come look... It's a woman. Who is she? Must be Chin-ho's wife. Impossible. Must be his mistress, then. Mistress? How nice! I'll just get one too. You can't get one before marriage. And she's lots better than Little Cabbage. Ah-ho, the jacket. Who's Ah-jung? I am. I'm Huang Chin-ho. Your sister called me. You stay here. I have to go to class. We can talk later. You look familiar. You from Fengkuei? Your father has a hole in the head? Got hit with a baseball. We'll talk when I come back. He's in school. Night school. You're going again? The factory's getting dangerous now. Don't you know that? Do you have to go? Huang Chin-ho. Who'll go to market with me? I'll cock a banguel for lunch. When I was little, I played ball with my father once. I saw a snake. And Dad killed it. A few days later, I went back to look. The snake had dried into nothing but skin. How old were you then? Five or six. How do you remember it so clearly? I don't know. He remembers everything about his father. His father is a celebrity in our hometown. He has a black hole in his head. Once I went to see Ah-ching and his father kept smiling at me. I was scared to death. What do you mean, black hole? Ask him. He got it playing baseball. He loved to play baseball. A ball broke his skull. His bone got fractured. What happened? It short-circuited him. Here, Ah-ching. Who was that woman? Talked so loud. That was my sister. What year were you born? 1963. So old? I thought you were 17. You from Makung like us? No, I'm from Keeling. Why'd you come down here, all alone? She's mad. Ah-ching. Ah-ching. Meet some friends. This is Ah-lin. Hello. This is Chuan-tza. This is Yung-feng. He's my friend Ah-ching. Have a smoke. Big place. Can I hide out here? Sure. A girl, too... not bad. Have you used her? No, she's my friend. A friend is a friend. What's the harm in borrowing her? What did you say? What are you doing? Does this look nice? Wind and rain. Disaster brings injury. Success is unlikely. A trip is in store. No one gives help. Success is elusive. Success is difficult. Marriage is unlikely. Hsiao-Hsing. Try to think about it thoroughly. I'm doing this for us. Aren't you anxious to get married? We can't do it without money. Don't say it so simply. When did I mention marriage? Okay, you didn't mention it! Don't show me that sour face anymore. You're crazy. So salty. Why not get a sweet one? Who are you looking for? I'm Wu Mei-li's brother. Mei-li's brother. You're from Penghu? Yes. Have a seat there! Did you come today, or when? We came last month. Who is he? Who are you? I am your brother-in-law. Your unregistered brother-in-law. You know that? I don't know. You don't know? Your sister didn't tell you? No. Your mother knows. I met her last time she came here. Didn't you say you'd come tomorrow? No, I said I'd come today. You did. You said tomorrow. You must be deaf. It was today. Well? Winning or losing? With these three, how could I win? - Hurry up. - Just a minute, let me see. Your brother doesn't know me. Why aren't you at work? We're off today. - A bonus holiday. - What for? The boss is marrying a concubine. They're off; the boss is marrying a concubine. Didn't your brother take them to the Kangtu? Nonsense. I'll lose today, because I saw it. - No, that's only for men. - Want to see a movie? It doesn't apply to women. - Give me a few hundred. - What for? To take them for some fun. Take this thousand. You know where it is? Let's go. Buy a book! See a movie! Have some fun, I'll tell you of something fun here. How much does a movie cost? If you like watching movies, NT$300 each, NT$900 for three. - How about it? - European films, double feature. Come on. Come on! I'm telling you straight. In color, big screen. Here! Here! It's over there, 11th floor. Isn't that an empty building? An empty building is the best for this. NT$300 each, NT$900 for three. Change? Where do we go in? Hurry up! Before the policemen come. Nothing here. We've been had. Big screen, in color. Let's go get him. Where? Kaohsiung is a big place. It isn't Fengkuei, you know. It was you who wanted to come. Okay, no need to talk about it. We spent NT$900 to look at the view. It's your fault! What a joke. - Who? - Say no more about it. Forget it! It's useless to study. Cops. Cops, Ah-ching! Cover for me. What have you done now? Nothing. Just beat up a guy... With my friend Ah-lin. Why hang around with people like him? Whatever you do, don't let me know. How about it? Still questioning. What's it all about, anyway? The factory lost some goods. He's a suspect. Actually, he did take them. I told him, but he wouldn't listen. Will they lock up Ah-ho? Lock him up? He's been fired. That's bad enough. He would have been promoted next month. Anyway, it's rotten luck for him. Did he do it, or not? Don't poke your nose into it. If you go to sea, what about your studies? I'll quit. Quit? Right. Why? By the time I graduate, there'll be no money to make. Why are you so stupid? That makes sense, so I don't study either. - You think the same as I do. - Come on. This one we have to drain. Next time you come here, when will your wedding banquet be? - We'll see. - We'll see? Peach, cheers. I will go playing tomorrow. I am the emperor. Emperor should go first. Slippers ran away. My slippers ran away by themselves. Drink, Peach. Buy us more drink, Peach. Hsiao-Hsing! Hsiao-Hsing! Hsiao-Hsing! Hsiao-Hsing, I'm leaving tomorrow. Why don't you keep me company? Hsiao-Hsing! Hsiao-Hsing! Come in a while, Hsiao-Hsing. Chin-ho... he's gone. Well? Nothing. Did you show it to her? Yes, I did. - Then, what did she say? - Nothing. You fool, you should stand over there and wait. - What's embarrassing you? - Stop, or we'll be scolded. I'll resign next week. My brother-in-law has gotten hold of some cassettes. I'm gonna sell them! I went to see a stall a few days ago. I'll never be rich if I stay here. I tell you, I'm in bad mood. Don't joke with me. Can't a good friend joke with you? - I don't like it. So what? - Is that what you think? What kind of friend are you? - What do you want to do? - What do you want to do? How can you say that? You're not my friend. Try to say it again. What are you doing, Ah-ching? What are you guys doing? Stop fighting. Enough, stop it. Enough, stop it. Why are they fighting? Aren't they friends? How can they act like that? What a frightful fight. Quiet now. Come in. No thanks, I'm going home. Go on then! Go on. Just a minute, Ah-ching. Special delivery for you. My father's dead. Ah-ching. Have something to eat, Ah-ching. Come eat, Ah-ching. Time for dinner. What are you sitting here for? I'm full, Auntie. Who is she? A co-worker. Girls sure are outgoing these days. We weren't like that. What are you doing in Kaohsiung? Don't think you're out of control. Don't run wild with the others. Things have changed at home now. You've got to think about things more. Your brother-in-law's factory needs a worker. Do you want to go? It's easy work. Do you want to go? Did you hear what your sister's saying? You shouldn't go back to Kaohsiung. Stay home and wait for the army induction. If the police get you in Kaohsiung, there'll be nobody to pay your bail. Come in. Who're you looking for? I'm Chin-ho's friend. Oh! Chin-ho. He isn't here, he's working in Kaohsiung. I know! I came from Kaohsiung. Oh... Who are you? I'm his co-worker. His co-worker... Why didn't he come with you? He's not in Kaohsiung now. He went to sea. Went to sea? We didn't know that. When did he leave? Not long ago. I'm his sister-in-law. Come in and have a seat. No thanks. I have to leave. It's okay. Sit for a while. No, thanks. Isn't anybody else at home? No, his father and brother are at sea. Thanks. Good-bye. Bought 100 tapes. How's business, boss? Bad. No buyers. Rotten fart, boss. Pretend you're buying some. - That'll make other people buy, too. - That's right. Look over here. NT$10 for three, is it? NT$10, that's below price! No matter. Big sale! NT$10 for three. What's the matter? Have some muskmelon. Have a piece, it's sweet. Have a piece, Hsiao-Hsing. Who wrote it? Huang Chin-ho. I'm going to take a shower. What's his letter say? He said their ship was broken. That his ship's being repaired in Japan. The company is sending them home. Hsiao-Hsing, it's almost 7. You haven't even changed your clothes yet. Come inside a minute. Where are you going? Taipei. Taipei? I have a sister there. What'll you do? Find a job. Don't you have a good job here? I want to leave. I don't want to see Ah-ho. Here is my chop. Please pick up this month's pay for me. I'll send you my address in Taipei. You can remit the money to me. I'll take you to the station. No, thanks. You have to go to work. Cheer up! Don't be so glum. Where in the world is there no women? Kuo-tzu goes in the army in 2 days. Look at that, we made it ourselves. Not bad at all. Aren't you returning to Fengkuei, then? Kuo-tzu. Aren't you returning to Fengkuei? I'm going back tomorrow. I'll report in Makung. Come! Come! Big army induction sale. Three for NT$50. Buy one, get 2 free! NT$50 for three.
