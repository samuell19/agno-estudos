WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS NOT ME. THIS IS NOT MY LIFE. [screams] [gasps] [puts the gear in park] - THOUGH MR. SIXT WAS A MAN OF FEW FRIENDS, OF THOSE FEW WHO KNEW HIM, PERHAPS MARY WILLIAMS KNEW HIM THE BEST. SHE WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS BEFORE WE CONVEY MR. MARTIN SIXT TO HIS FINAL RESTING PLACE. MARY. - THANK YOU. MY FATHER FIRST MET MARTIN SIXT A FEW YEARS AFTER THE KOREAN WAR. THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT AT THE TIME, BUT BOTH HAD BEEN WOUNDED AT THE BATTLE OF PORK CHOP HILL. IN FACT, THEY BOTH ALMOST DIED THERE. DAD SAID THAT WHEN HE AND MARTIN FINALLY DID MEET, MARTIN TOLD HIM HE HAD NO FAMILY AND NO MONEY AND NO PLACE TO LIVE. AND ALL MARTIN WANTED WAS TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN OUR SHED OUT BACK. JUST FOR A WHILE TILL HE GOT BACK ON HIS FEET. AND DAD SAID HE COULD, BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH OUT THERE. NO HOT WATER, JUST A HOSE BIB, AND A BARE BULB HANGING DOWN. AND MARTIN SAID, "THAT'S OKAY. 'CAUSE I DON'T NEED VERY MUCH." SO THEY MADE A DEAL. AND THEY SHOOK ON IT. MARTIN WOULD PAY $12 A MONTH FOR AS LONG AS HE WANTED TO STAY THERE. GROWING UP, I REMEMBER WE DIDN'T SEE VERY MUCH OF MARTIN. HE KEPT TO HIMSELF MOSTLY. THEN LATER, OF COURSE, I GOT MARRIED AND MOVED OUT AND STARTED A FAMILY OF MY OWN. THEN AFTER DAD DIED IN '93 AND MOM FOLLOWED IN '98, RENTED OUT THE MAIN HOUSE. BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW? MARTIN SIXT WAS STILL LIVING IN THE SHED OUT BACK, STILL PAYING $12 ON THE FIRST OF EACH MONTH. HE NEVER MISSED. NOT ONCE. HE AND MY FATHER HAD MADE A DEAL AND HAD BOTH LIVED UP TO IT. WELL, NATURALLY, I FELT THAT IT WAS MY JOB TO CONTINUE TO HONOR THAT DEAL. SO NOW MARTIN IS GONE. AND THE SAD THING IS... I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT HIM THAN WHAT I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU. IN FACT, MOST OF THE TOWN HARDLY EVEN KNEW HE EXISTED. I DO KNOW THAT HE DID SOME WOODWORKING FOR PEOPLE, AND THEY WERE HAPPY WITH THAT. AND HE PAID HIS RENT ON TIME LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD BECAUSE MARTIN SIXT WAS A MAN OF HIS WORD. AND THAT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING. I FELT THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS GIVE HIM A DECENT BURIAL. RIGHT, DAD? HE'S SMILING. THERE YOU HAVE IT. THAT WAS MARTIN SIXT. - WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE CASKET OUT NOW. [whispers] THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME. - YES. - WE'RE SHORT A PALLBEARER TODAY. WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU COULD OBLIGE US. - ME? BUT I DIDN'T EVEN... - THANK YOU. YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT TO THE CEMETERY, ARE YOU, MARY? - NO. NO, I GOT A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. - WELL, WE ALL HAVE TO MEET OUR MAKER BY OURSELVES. I'LL SAY A PRAYER FOR YOU SUNDAY, MARTIN. - THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, REVEREND. HE WAS A GOOD MAN. - HELLO, ENID. - HELLO. HELLO. ABBY, RIGHT? - YES. HAVE WE MET BEFORE? - DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE WISHING... OH. NO, WE'VE NEVER MET. YOU'RE RIGHT. - OH. OKAY. WELL, I'M ABBY. MY DAD OWNS THE PAPER. - IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, ABBY MY DAD OWN THE PAPER. - HE'S ON ASSIGNMENT RIGHT NOW. - OH. - I'M WORKING ON MY "THIS DAY IN HISTORY" COLUMN. - IT LOOKS GREAT. - THANKS. - I AM GONNA GO BACK TO MY DESK. - OKAY. - EVERYTHING OKAY, HONEY? - VERY GOOD. AND I'D LIKE A GLASS OF PINOT NOIR. - ME TOO, BUT ALL I GOT IS PLAIN RED. - WELL, THAT'LL DO. - WELL, I'LL JUST BRING IT RIGHT OVER. ROOM AT THE INN COMFY? - IT'S FINE. - BIG JIM IS MY EX. I ALWAYS LIKE TO MAKE SURE HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB. - NO COMPLAINTS. - REALLY? WELL, I HAD PLENTY. - [laughs] - YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW. 'CAUSE HE'D DO ANYTHING TO SHUT ME UP. - WILL DO. - MAY I? - OF COURSE. - I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE ARTICLE. - ON MARTIN SIXT'S FUNERAL. - YES. - WHAT ABOUT IT? - SIMPLE TRUTH, IT'S NOT ALL THERE. - WHAT? - LOOK, YOU MISSED THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. - UM, ARE YOU GIVING ME WRITING TIPS? DO YOU KNOW THE COVER STORIES I'VE WRITTEN? I'M SORRY. - IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR WRITING STYLE. THAT'S FINE. IT'S ABOUT SUBSTANCE. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE MISSING. - OKAY. - LOOK, MARTIN SIXT'S LIFE WAS NO LESS VALUABLE THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S. SURE, HE WAS PRIVATE AND HE WAS QUIET, BUT HE HAD HONOR AND DIGNITY. - RIGHT? - WELL, HE WASN'T FAMOUS, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS LIFE THAT WAS GOOD THAT WE CAN ALL BENEFIT FROM. HE KEPT HIS WORD. - I UNDERSTAND. - GET THE REWRITE DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'M SAVING ROOM ON PAGE TWO. TOMORROW'S EDITION. - OKAY, DEFINITELY. - LOOK, UM, I'M NOT NORMALLY SO HARD ON PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH, BUT YOU'RE GOOD. YOU COULD JUST BE BETTER. THE OFFICE WILL BE OPEN ALL EVENING. - MARK, YOUR FOOD'S READY. - THANK YOU, DONETTE. - HI. - HI. - GOOD NIGHT, DADDY. - GOOD NIGHT, BABY. - GOOD NIGHT, CYNTHIA. - [laughs] GOOD NIGHT, ABBY. [phone rings] HELLO, CHRONICLE. MR. UPSHAW FROM THE VERNON NEWSPAPER SYNDICATE? NO, NO, HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE DOES STAY AND WORK LATE SOMETIMES. HANG ON. LET ME GET A PEN. OKAY. YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM THAT THE OFFER WON'T BE ON THE TABLE FOREVER AND THAT IF HE'S SMART, HE'LL TAKE IT. OH, DON'T WRITE THAT. OH, HE SHOULD JUST KNOW THAT. OKAY. I'LL GIVE HIM THE MESSAGE. THANK YOU. - SHE'D RATHER BE HERE WITH ME THAN WITH A BABYSITTER ALL THE TIME. WE LOST HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS TWO. I THINK SHE MISSES WHAT SHE NEVER HAD. - I'M SORRY. - THAT'S OKAY. WE HAVE A GOOD TIME. SHE LIKES IT. IT'S KIND OF LIKE CAMPING OUT, EXCEPT... - EXCEPT SHE'S NOT CAMPING AND SHE'S NOT OUT. - EXACTLY. BUT WE'LL GO HOME AS SOON AS I GET THIS PAPER PUT TO BED. - I THINK IT'S NICE. - I DO TOO. - OH, MISS TAMERLINE, THIS IS WHAT I CALL LITERATURE. [laughs] [phone rings] - HEY, MARK. - HEY, CYNTHIA, I GOT YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT. - OKAY, MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT. - YEAH, GO DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION AND TALK TO LITTLE JIM. - GOT IT. - MA'AM. - THANK YOU. - MM-HMM. - HI. I'M LOOKING FOR THE POLICE CHIEF. - I'M THE CHIEF. BUT PEOPLE CALL ME LITTLE JIM. I'M BIG JIM'S SON. - OH, CYNTHIA TAMERLINE FROM CELEB--THE CHRONICLE. - AND YOU'RE HERE FOR THE BLOTTER? - YEAH. - WELL, IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, WE'VE BEEN OUT ON A BARKING DOG, AND A DOG WHO WAS HOWLING, AND ANOTHER BARKING DOG THAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE SAME BARKING DOG AS THE FIRST DOG. THAT'S THREE INCIDENTS. - THAT IT? - WE GOT A CALL FROM MRS. MULLINS THAT MR. MULLINS WAS STAYING TOO LONG AT CJ'S BAR AND SHE WANTED HIM TO COME HOME. - SO SHE CALLED YOU? - IT'S MY AUNTY. AND MY UNCLE WASN'T ANSWERING HIS CELL PHONE. - OH. - BUT I'D RATHER YOU NOT PRINT THAT. BIG JIM DOESN'T KNOW. - IT'S OUR SECRET. - THANKS. WELL, SEE YOU NEXT TIME. - LITTLE JIM. HEY, LITTLE JIM. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M TALKING TO YOU. LITTLE JIM! [knocks at door] LISTEN, THERE'S A PARKING METER ON THE CORNER THAT'S OUT OF ORDER. WELL, IT'S TAKING PEOPLE'S MONEY, AND IT'S NOT GIVING THEM ANY TIME ON THE METER. THAT'S THEFT! PEOPLE ARE BEING ROBBED. AND WHAT ARE THE POLICE DOING ABOUT IT? NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULDN'T GIVE A HOOT ABOUT THAT. I JU--OH. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE CYNTHIA TAMERLINE, RIGHT? - YES, LOOK, I'M SORRY IF I-- - I READ YOUR ARTICLE THIS MORNING ON MARTIN SIXT. I'D LIKE TO PAY YOU A COMPLIMENT. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SO TRUE. - MY ARTICLE? - YOU REALLY CAPTURED HIM. MARTIN WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE. HE LOVED THE CHRONICLE. HE USED TO READ IT EVERY DAY FROM COVER TO COVER. WELL, MOST PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN DO. ANYWAY, THANK YOU. - THANK--THANK YOU.

GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT. LET'S GO, KIDDO. - BYE. SHE'S NICE. CYNTHIA. - YEAH, I THINK SO TOO. - IS SHE LIKE MOM USED TO BE? - NO. NOBODY'S LIKE MOMMY USED TO BE. SHE WAS ONE OF A KIND. - IS THERE SUCH A THING AS TWO OF A KIND? - NO. - BUT COULD THERE BE ANOTHER OF A KIND? - I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE ASKING SOME HARD QUESTIONS HERE. WHAT, ARE YOU A REPORTER? - THIS ONE THEY USED TO GIVE AWAY WITH CIGARETTES CALLED BLUE DEVILS TO SOLDIERS GOING INTO THE WAR IN THE EARLY 1940s. - THAT'S INTERESTING. WHAT'S YOUR MOST VALUABLE ONE? - GUY OFFERED ME $2,000 FOR IT. - WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE IT? - WELL, THAT'S JUST MONEY. I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE ACCUMULATING THESE. - OF COURSE. - SOMETIMES I PLAY A LITTLE GAME AND I TRY TO SEE HOW MANY I CAN LIGHT IN, LIKE, 30 SECONDS. - I BET THAT'S FUN. - 21 WOULD BE A NEW RECORD. I'M THINKING ABOUT GOING FOR IT. THEN I'D BE FAMOUS. - GOOD NIGHT. - YOU BACK FROM KEENIE'S? - YES. QUITE A COLLECTION. - YEAH, HE'S A BIT ECCENTRIC. - WELL, THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY. - YEAH, YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT KEENIE? - THERE'S MORE? - HE DOESN'T SMOKE. [laughter] [phone rings as siren wails] - HELLO. - CYNTHIA, I NEED YOU TO GET TO KEENIE JAMES' HOUSE. - KEENIE JAMES' HOUSE? - YEAH, I'LL MEET YOU THERE. - THANKS. - STRETCH 'EM OUT. HURRY UP. HURRY UP. - GO. LET'S GET SOME PRESSURE ON HERE. TURN IT ON. - KEENIE, ARE YOU OKAY? - I'M ALL RIGHT. FELL DOWN WHEN I GOT OUTSIDE. I HURT MY ANKLE. [coughs] - WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY. - COULDN'T SEE A THING. - WHAT HAPPENED? - I SET THE NEW LIGHTER LIGHTING RECORD. HAD 21 OF 'EM GOING AT ONCE. THEN I NOTICED THE FIRST ONE HAD GOT TOO NEAR THE CURTAINS. WENT UP LIKE THAT. GOT SOME WATER. OR THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS. THREW IT ON THE CURTAINS. TURNED OUT IT WAS VODKA. - I'M AFRAID IT'S A TOTAL LOSS, KEENIE, WITH THE SMOKE AND THE FIRE INSIDE AND THE WATER WE'RE HAVING TO POUR ON IT. - IT'S ALL RIGHT, CHARLIE. IT WAS MY FAULT. - HOW'S YOUR INSURANCE? - HAD IT UP UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN I LOST MY JOB IN SPRINGBORO. I'M GONNA TAKE YOU TO EMERGENCY. HAVE 'EM LOOK YOU OVER. - SORRY. I HAD TO TAKE ABBY TO DONETTE'S. WHAT HAPPENED? - KEENIE PAID HIS PRICE FOR FAME. - LOOK, YOU WROTE A TERRIFIC ARTICLE ON KEENIE. - YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T RUN IT. - BUT I CAN HOLD THE PRINTERS WHILE WE WRITE AN ADDENDUM TO YOUR ARTICLE. WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE. A BREAKING STORY. - NO, THAT'LL TAKE TOO LONG. - IT'LL BE TIGHT, BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. - ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. [tapping at keyboard] GOOD MORNING. - NICE WORK. - SHE DID A GOOD JOB, HUH? - HEY, GREAT ARTICLE. YOU'RE TURNING OUT TO BE A FIRST-RATE WRITER. - WELL, THANKS. BUT IT WAS MOSTLY MARK. - RIGHT, GOT YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT. CITY COUNCIL MEETING AT NOON. - KEENIE. KEENIE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - SURE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOUR WROTE ABOUT ME. IT WAS SPECIAL. I DON'T HAVE MY COLLECTION OR MY HOUSE ANYMORE, BUT I GOT YOUR ARTICLE. - THINGS WILL GET BETTER. - [laughs] THEY GOT TO. THEY CAN'T GET MUCH WORSE. - SO MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE VOTE FOR A NEW LEVY FOR THE RESERVOIR. DON. - BIG. - NOW THIS LEVY WAS BUILT IN 1927 BY OUR PREDECESSORS, SO I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF SLOW CREEK THAT THEY RECEIVE GOOD WATER AND PLENTY OF IT. SO I VOTE THAT WE GET FUNDS FOR IT. - I SECOND THE MOTION. - UH-HUH. SO NOW LET'S CALL THE VOTE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR? all: AYE. - ALL OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT, THE MOTION IS PASSED. ALL RIGHT, NOW DO WE HAVE ANY NEW BUSINESS? - MAY I ASK A QUESTION? - WELL, GO AHEAD. - KEENIE LOST EVERYTHING IN THE FIRE-- HIS LIGHTER COLLECTION, HIS HOUSE--EVERYTHING. AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WE COULD DO TO HELP HIM. - KEENIE WAS AN IDIOT. HE WAS ALWAYS AN IDIOT. - THAT'S TRUE, NELBERT, BUT HE'S OUR IDIOT. AND NOW HE'S LOST EVERYTHING. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, NELBERT? - YOU KNOW THE CONNOLLY HOUSE, BIG JIM. THE TOWN OWNS THAT, RIGHT? - OH, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, LITTLE JIM? - I SAY WE LEASE IT TO HIM CHEAP AND HE FIXES IT UP. - WELL, NOW, DO I HEAR A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT? - MAY I? - YOU MAY. [laughter] [phone rings] - CHRONICLE. [laughs] YES, THE METEOR SHOWER IS TONIGHT. IT'S GONNA BE ON FULL DISPLAY IN THE SOUTHERN SKY. - I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE LOAN WOULD BE APPROVED. NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE COLLATERAL. NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. LOOK, I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS PAPER RUN WITHOUT IT. HI. - HI. - DID THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING? - YES. - ANYTHING GOOD? - UH, THEY VOTED TO LET KEENIE HAVE THE OLD CONNOLLY PLACE. - I BET YOUR ARTICLE HELPED. - MAYBE. I HOPE SO. - WELL, THANK YOU. - SO WHAT'S MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT? - UH, LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK? GO TO DONETTE'S, HAVE A COFFEE. I'LL LET YOU KNOW. - OKAY. [tapping at keyboard] - YOU GOING TONIGHT? - WHERE? - TO THE METEOR SHOWER. MOST PEOPLE ARE GONNA SEE IT FROM GROVER'S FIELD 'CAUSE IT'S GOT THE CLEAREST VIEW OF THE SOUTH. - WELL, I HADN'T PLANNED ON IT. - OH, YOU HAVE TO. IT'S GONNA BE SO BEAUTIFUL, AND THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE HERE SINCE 1935. - OH, I DON'T KNOW. - WELL, YOU'RE GOING WITH ME, AND I DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. YOU'LL LOVE IT, AND MARK IS SURE TO BE THERE. - WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? - OH, NOTHING. EXCEPT EVERYTHING. UNLESS I'M WRONG. WHICH I'M NOT EVER. - HE'S KIND OF... [laughs] HE'S A VERY GOOD PERSON. - OH, GOOD PERSON. WELL, I LIKE THAT. THAT'S FUNNY. - WHAT? - SAME THING HE SAID ABOUT YOU. - IT'S GONNA START RIGHT UP THERE. - NO, NO, IT'S THAT WAY. - RIGHT UP THERE, BUDDY. RIGHT UP THERE. THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE COMING. - NO, NO, THE WEATHER MAN SAID SOUTH OF TOWN. - WHAT, SOUTH OF TOWN? ARE YOU KIDDING? - NO, NO, HE SAID SOUTH OF TOWN. - THIS IS WHERE IT'S GONNA BE, MY BOY. RIGHT THERE. - RUN, RUN. [laughter] - IT'S QUITE A TURNOUT. - WELL, SURE, PEOPLE SEE A BIG THING LIKE THIS, IT REMINDS 'EM OF HOW LARGE THE HEAVENS ARE AND HOW LITTLE TIME WE HAVE ON THIS EARTH TO DO WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. - WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? - MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT WE ARE, WELCOME LOVE WHEN WE FIND IT, AND BE HAPPY. - OH, IS THAT ALL? - HONEY, THAT'S NOT ONLY ALL, THAT'S EVERYTHING. HEY, GUYS, NICE TO SEE YOU. - YOU'RE LIKE THE MAYOR. - OH, WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED TO THE MAYOR FOR A WHILE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE OWE YOU MONEY FOR FOOD. - HEY, DONETTE. OH, YOU HAVE CYNTHIA HERE. - SURE DO. - HI. - THIS IS CYNTHIA TAMERLINE. SHE WROTE THAT ARTICLE ON KEENIE FOR THE CHRONICLE. YOU REALLY GOT KEENIE DOWN. - WELL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - OH, YOU HAVE A NICE EVENING NOW. - YOU TOO, NELBERT. - HE'S A PHENOMENAL EDITOR. HE'S ALSO MADE ME A BETTER WRITER. - WELL, HE THINKS YOU'RE NATURALLY TALENTED. - HUH. YOU KNOW, THE FUNNY THING IS IS I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A GREAT WRITER. SINCE I STARTED OUT AT THE MAGAZINE, I NEVER STOPPED TO SAY, WHAT AM I WRITING? WHAT COULD I BE? WHAT DO I WANT? - WELL, HONEY, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE PERSON THAT CAN CHANGE THE PAST. BUT THE FUTURE, THAT'S STILL UP IN THE AIR. - HI, ABBY. - HI, LITTLE CUTIE PIE. - CAN SHE SIT WITH US? - OH, I DON'T KNOW. - OH, GO AHEAD. I GOT TO SIT WITH BIG JIM AND THE FAMILY. WELL, THEY OWE ME MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THIS TOWN. AND THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT. [laughter] - LET'S FIND MY DAD. - OKAY. - I FOUND HER. - HEY, GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. - YOU CAN HAVE MY SEAT. I'VE GOT THIS ONE. - HERE, BABY. - THANKS. - EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE KEENIE THING. - OH, I'M JUST GLAD EVERYTHING'S GONNA WORK OUT FOR HIM. - YEAH, WELL, IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU. - WELL, YOU HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT TOO. - MM, MY POINT IS THAT, UM, I REALLY WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD WRITER. YOU'VE HIT YOUR STRIDE. YOU COULD PRETTY MUCH GO ANYWHERE YOU WANTED AND DO WELL. - SOUNDS OMINOUS. - WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED BY IT. - WHAT? - TOMORROW A MAN NAMED MR. UPSHAW IS COMING TO TOWN TO BUY THE CHRONICLE. HE OWNS VERNON NEWSPAPERS. IT'S A SYNDICATE OF SMALLER PAPERS THAT HE'S BOUGHT UP, USUALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE STRUGGLING. - THAT'S WHO'S BEEN CALLING? - HE'S BEEN AFTER ME FOR A WHILE. - ARE YOU GONNA SELL? - I HAVE TO FACE REALITY. IT'S NOT LIKE THE CHRONICLE'S A MONEYMAKING OPERATION. ON A GOOD YEAR, WE BREAK EVEN. AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD YEAR FOR A WHILE. - THAT'S TOO BAD. - YOU KNOW, IT'S STORIES LIKE KEENIE'S THAT MAKE THIS EVEN WORSE. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND. - UPSHAW'S OPERATION, IT PUTS OUT A GENERIC PAPER. IT'S ALMOST NO LOCAL NEWS. THEY BUY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STORIES AND JUST REPACKAGE THEM. THE STRENGTH OF THE CHRONICLE AND PAPERS LIKE IT IS THAT THEY'RE THE FABRIC OF A TOWN. AND THEY GIVE A PLACE LIKE SLOW CREEK AN IDENTITY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER STARTED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. I FIGURE THAT THEY'LL PROBABLY JUST MAKE IT A ONE-PERSON OFFICE. ENID MOST LIKELY. SHE'LL BE THERE TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. - YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE THERE? - IT'S NOT THE KIND OF PLACE I'D WANT TO WORK. - BUT YOU LOVE THAT PAPER. - I DO. BUT NOW I'LL BE ABLE TO PAY OFF A WHOLE SLEW OF DEBTS, BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME INSURANCE FOR HER FUTURE. YOU KNOW, WHAT'S FUNNY IS THAT, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I HATED THE PAPER. SO I GOT OUT OF TOWN, WENT TO CHICAGO, GOT ON STAFF AT THE HERALD, AND I DID PRETTY WELL. I GOT PROMOTED TO THE CITY DESK, I WAS IN LINE FOR A DEPARTMENT EDITOR. - REALLY? - AND THEN I SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF AS A SINGLE PARENT. SO WE CAME BACK HOME, I TOOK OVER THE PAPER FOR MY DAD. AT FIRST IT WAS REALLY HARD. EVENTUALLY, I STARTED TO LOVE IT. - YOU'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB. - LOOK AT THIS. LOOK, IT'S STARTING! [exclamations] - LOOK AT THEM! LOOK AT THAT! - HEY, I SEE ONE. - WOW. - ABBY. - OH, THAT'S COOL! - WAKE UP. IT'S STARTING. [exclamations] - IT'S BETTER THAN FIREWORKS. [exclamations] - OH, MAN. - AH. - LOOK AT THAT. - THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE. - AH. [chatter] - THAT'S IT, BOYS. - OH, WOW. - MM. - WELL, ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU AT THE HOUSE. - YEAH, THANKS, BIG. - SEE YOU LATER. - SEE YOU TOMORROW! - OH, THERE YOU ARE. OH, WASN'T IT AMAZING? - IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. - OH. WELL. HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA. WHY DON'T I TAKE ABBY FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO MY HOUSE WHERE THERE'S A BLUEBERRY PIE THAT NEEDS TASTING? WHAT DO YOU SAY? - THAT SOUNDS NICE. - I LIKE BLUEBERRY PIE. - MAYBE YOU AND I COULD DO SOMETHING. - I'D LOVE TO. - YOU'VE DONE A REALLY GREAT JOB WITH ABBY. SHE'S A WONDERFUL GIRL. - THANKS. WE HAVE OUR MOMENTS, BUT SHE'S TURNED OUT PRETTY GOOD. DONE MOST OF IT ON HER OWN. LUCKY FOR ME. - WELL, STILL IT HAD TO BE REALLY HARD. - AT TIMES. I'M REALLY SORRY FOR YOUR JOB AT THE NEWSPAPER. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE. LIKE YOU SAID, I COULD GET A JOB ANYWHERE ELSE. - AM I SELLING OUT? - I THINK YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. - I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M BETRAYING MY DAD AND HIS DAD. I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS WRONG. - YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ALWAYS TRY THE WISHING WELL. - I WISH I BELIEVED IN IT. - WELL, THAT IS ONE OF THE RULES. BELIEVING. - OH, IS THAT SO? - YEAH. AND ALSO HAVING THE RIGHT WISH. - WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S THE RIGHT WISH? - WHEN IT COMES TRUE. - I BELIEVE ABBY HAS GOTTEN TO YOU. - SHE HAS. AND SO HAVE YOU. THIS WHOLE PLACE. HEY, THANKS AGAIN. - IT WAS MY PLEASURE. AND BELIEVE ME, IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SAID THAT TO ANYONE. MAYBE I SHOULD BELIEVE IN MIRACLES. 'CAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT I'D WANT TO KISS A WOMAN LIKE THAT AGAIN. THAT'S FUNNY? - NO, IT'S JUST, THE THING IS, A GUY ONCE SAID TO ME I COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF MY FACE. MAYBE NOW I CAN. [laughs] - I BETTER... - [laughs] - OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA-- I'M GONNA GO GET ABBY. - YEAH. GET ABBY. - GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT. [engine starts] [car pulls away] - DID YOU MAKE AN APPOINTMENT? - HELLO, I'M MR. UPSHAW. AND YOU ARE? - ENID. - ENID. HMM. AND WHO IS THIS? - THIS IS CYNTHIA. - CYNTHIA. MR. JONES, MS. REILLY. - MARK'S IN HIS OFFICE. MARK! THEY'RE HERE. - HI, MARK JENSEN. - YES, OF COURSE. - WELL, SHALL WE GO TO MY OFFICE? - YES, THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG. WE'VE DRAWN UP ALL THE PAPERS. - I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY. - MARK SAID HE THOUGHT THEY'D KEEP YOU TO STAY AND RUN THE OFFICE. - [scoffs] FAT CHANCE. - SHH. - IF HE GOES, I GO. LET THEM FIND THEIR OWN IDIOT TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY DO AND CALL IT A NEWSPAPER. - ENID. - WHAT? - ENID, I NEED TO TALK TO MARK. - HE'S BUSY. - HI. - HI, ABBY. - WELL, I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO HIM RIGHT AWAY. - LOOK, MARY, IF THIS IS SOME COMPLAINT ABOUT THE NEWSPAPER, YOU CAN JUST SAVE IT. - NO, IT'S NOT A COMPLAINT. - THIS NEWSPAPER IS ABOUT TO HAVE A NEW OWNER IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. - WELL, THEN HE'S REALLY GONNA WANT TO TALK TO ME. - MARY, WHAT'S HAPPENED? - AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'VE MADE IT VERY SIMPLE FOR YOU. - WELL, YOU'VE MADE IT SIMPLE FOR YOURSELF, LET'S BE HONEST. - I'M NOT HERE TO FORCE YOU. YOU CALLED ME. REMEMBER? - MARK. [knocking] MARK, WAIT. - WHAT? - DID YOU SIGN ANYTHING YET? - NO. - OH, DADDY. - YOU GOT TO HEAR THIS. - WHAT? - MARK, COME OVER HERE. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. - WHAT IS IT? - THIS IS THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF MARTIN SIXT. - MARTIN HAD A WILL? - I KNOW. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT MYSELF. BUT WE WENT THROUGH HIS SHED WHERE HE LIVED FOR 60 YEARS AND PAID $12 A MONTH, AND THERE IT WAS. IT'S NOTARIZED AND EVERYTHING. LEGAL AND ALL. - SO? A MAN HAD A WILL. WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH FINISHING THIS SALE? - WELL, IF YOU'LL BE QUIET, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. - [laughs] - BECAUSE MARTIN PAID JUST $12 A MONTH FOR 60 YEARS, HE MANAGED TO SAVE VIRTUALLY ALL OF HIS MONEY, WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE A PILE IF YOU CONSIDER THE INTEREST AND SUCH. AND HE'S LEFT IT ALL TO THE SLOW CREEK CHRONICLE AS LONG AS OWNERSHIP OF THE PAPER REMAINS EXACTLY AS IT IS. I KNEW HE LOVED THE CHRONICLE. - I GUESS SOMEONE'S WISH CAME TRUE. - WE'RE SAVED. - WE'RE SAVED! [laughs] - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE BEGINNING OUR FINAL APPROACH INTO NEW YORK. PLEASE PUT YOUR CHAIR BACKS IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE STAY SEATED UNTIL THE SEAT BELT SIGN HAS BEEN TURNED OFF. [phone rings] - HELLO. - BACK IN CIVILIZATION? - RACHEL? - OH, DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT. LIKE MY MOTHER SAYS IT.

WAIT, RACHEL, WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED ME BACK? - WHEN? - WHEN I LEFT YOU ALL THOSE MESSAGES. - YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ANY MESSAGES. AND I ALWAYS CALL YOU BACK. ALL RIGHT, CALL ME AFTER THE INTERVIEW. THANK GOSH YOU'RE BACK FROM INDIANA. [beep] - ILLINOIS. [sirens wail] TYSON. - GOOD MORNING. YOU LOOK GREAT. FANTASTIC ABOUT THE INTERVIEW. I'M JUST STRAIGHTENING UP HERE. SO THE NEW STUFF IS THERE'S THE MET OPENING FOR THE IMPRESSIONIST COLLECTION. THAT'S THURSDAY. BOBBY'S SHOW IS FRIDAY. - TYSON. - WHAT? - HAVE I BEEN OKAY? - OKAY? NO, YOU'VE BEEN IN ILLINOIS. OH, BY THE WAY, ANGELA'S PEOPLE CALLED TWICE TO CONFIRM. YOU REALLY DID IT. - RIGHT. - SO WHO DO YOU WANT FIRST? - JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE, OKAY? - I UNDERSTAND. IT'S YOUR BIG DAY. YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF READY. TAKE YOUR TIME. I MEAN, I WOULD. IF I NEEDED IT. WHICH I DON'T. SO I WILL HOLD EVERYTHING, AND YOU CAN PREP. - GO AHEAD. - I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S GONNA BE HUGE.
