The guy who picked up the phone today was your dad? No. That's Oswaldo. My mom's boyfriend who lives with us. And your dad? What's up with him? My dad's dead. He was robbed and got killed. My dad is alive but he doesn't live with us. I live with my mom only. I see my dad every two weeks. Actually, I'll see him tomorrow. What, you only see him every two weeks? Yes. So tomorrow could be the last time you see him. I guess. You smoke a lot. You're going to die. Look. What's that? Pictures my mom sends me to convince me to quit smoking. A lung with cancer... Another lung... Is that a hole? In the throat. What the fuck? Yes. Another lung fucked up by smoking... Cancer... Lungs, lungs... What the fuck with that? Your mom doesn't want you to die. I think not. She'll sure get sad when you kill yourself. I think so. Yeah... And is it true what they say... that when you slit your veins it doesn't hurt? No, when you slit your veins it does hurt. But then you put your hands into the water and it stops hurting. And then you just like doze off. When did you cut yourself? About a year and a half ago. But my mom arrived to the house and... she took me to the hospital and here I am. You didn't do it properly. What do I know, but... I once read on an Emo Forum in Internet that... when you slit your wrists like this... the way you did... it takes too long to bleed and you have time to repent. Or the wound heals before you die and you only pass out. And you wake up in the hospital or... there in the bathtub. So they said that you have to cut yourself like this... all across the forearm. And then you put your arms into the water to make the pain stop... and for you to bleed out. And they also say that... you should wait until there's nobody home to avoid what happened to you... that your mom found you and saved you and all that. Also that you shouldn't do it naked because... what if your little brother or your grandma finds you? That's not cool. Yeah. Well, that's what I read on that Emo Forum... Are you Emo? No. No, not at all. Actually, these challenges about cutting yourself... I hate them. And that time, why did you try to kill yourself? I don't know. You don't know or you don't want to tell me? I don't want to tell you. It has to do with this guy Oswaldo who lives with your mom? No... We should go now, it's getting late. Yes. Let me just take my picture. Aren't you going to take your picture? Oh, no. It's that... I have a harder challenge. What? I have to walk over the edge of this building... and send a video. You want to wait here for me or do you want to join me? I'll go with you. OK. Will you record me? Alright. Here... Alright. Are you shooting already? No, I'm coming. All set. OK. CHALLENGE ACCOMPLISHED - Why are you still up? - Hello. Waiting for you. - Well, I'm here. - Do you know what time it is, Felix? Can we go to bed? Yeah, it's pretty late. Elisa, you promised your mom you weren't going out. - Go to bed. - Where on earth were you? Yes, Elisa, you promised you'd wait for me so we could talk. - Yeah, mom, but I had to go out. - Just wandering around. - Wandering around? - With whom, with the guy who called? Yeah, I was hanging out with some friends. Who is that boy? Is he your boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend. It's Felix. He's a friend from school. I just went over to his house to do some homework. - And what about the gloves? - Mom, what's wrong? - Mom, can I go to my room? - We're boring you? Please, Oswaldo, leave her. Can I go to my room, mom? - I swear I didn't do anything wrong. - Hey, mom, what's the matter? Yes, Elisa, you can go to sleep. OK. Com'on, mom, what's the matter? You know what, Felix? - What? - I'm just fed up. I can't deal with this by myself. With what? I talked to your dad and asked him to talk to you. I told him... I told him you were smoking a lot and that you're not attending class. Don't give me that face. You know perfectly well what I'm talking about. I got a call from school today and they told me you didn't go yesterday. Yeah, but I did go today. Look, Felix. Tell me the truth. Do you want to go live with your dad? No. But you don't want to live with me either. Or do you? You know what, mom? I'm really tired of this. I don't get what's wrong with you and I don't get what you want. Can I go to my room now? What? Nothing, Felix. Well, I'm going upstairs then. YOU CAN'T SPEAK TOMORROW FOR THE WHOLE DAY. I TRUST YOU. YOU CAN'T SPEAK TOMORROW FOR THE WHOLE DAY. I TRUST YOU. What's up with you smoking? Your mom told me. Is it true? Your mom calls me every night crying, Felix. That she doesn't know what to do with you. She gets very fucking intense. And now with this cigarette thing... it's worse. I don't give a fuck whether you smoke or not. And look, it's not that I don't care... If you want to get an emphysema or die of a fucking cancer... it's your call. And I respect that. But I need you to stop smoking inside the house. If you crave a cigarette... you go outside to smoke it. But don't let your mom see you. Got it? I need you to promise you're not going to smoke inside the house. So... I'll tell your mom you promised me you'll quit smoking. And I'll also tell her... you promised me to speak again tomorrow, OK? And what do you want to do? We can go to the movies. You don't need to talk at the movies. Let's go to the movies then. Elisa... Aren't you eating anything? I don't feel well, mom. May I go to my room? Let's see. Felix. Look at me. Your dad already told me he talked to you. That you promised him not to smoke again. You have a slight fever. I'm getting Ibuprofen. And that you'll speak again tomorrow. Alright. You better, huh? I HAVEN'T SPOKEN THIS WHOLE DAY. CHALLENGE ACCOMPLISHED? Who's that? Your boyfriend? I already told you I don't have a boyfriend. Take this. Mom, may I go to my room? Yes, go get some rest. Good night. CHALLENGE ACCOMPLISHED Elisa. Elisa. Can you open up, please? I'm coming, mom. Elisa, you and I agreed that you were never going to lock your door. Sorry, mom. I didn't mean to. Oswaldo and I are going to check the wedding menu and then to the movies. Do you want to come? No, I'm still not feeling well. I'd better stay, right? You don't have a fever anymore. Are you sure you don't want to come? I'm sure. Well, call me if you need anything. And please don't lock your door. OK. CHALLENGE 48 GET A GUN AND SHOOT AT SOMETHING. Hello? Hello? Elisa? What's up? What's up? Sorry I didn't call you yesterday... but the administrator said I couldn't speak for a whole day. Me too. Listen... Wasn't your dad bummed out with you not speaking to him? Not really. No, he didn't mind. My mom was the one who was pissed off. Listen... I'm calling you because I just received my new challenge. So did I. Yeah? And what did they ask of you? That I remove my eyebrows. Really? Yeah, really. And you took them off? Yes. And how do you look? Super gorgeous. Sure, super gorgeous. And did you do your new challenge? Not yet, my challenge is rather complicated. Why is it complicated? They're asking me to get a gun and shoot at something. What do you mean 'something'? Yeah, that's what it says. To shoot at something. It's not specific, so it can be whatever I want, right? OK. Yeah, OK, but the thing is where am I supposed to get a gun? Well, Oswaldo has a gun. I can look for it and lend it to you. Oswaldo has a gun there at your house? Yeah, I swear. He has it there at hand with you? OK, smartass, you want the gun, yes or no? No, yeah. I do want it, but... Where do we meet for you to give it to me? Do you want me to go with you? Do you want to go with me? If you want me to. Yeah, that'd be cool. OK. And what are you going to shoot at? It should be something cool. GET A GUN AND SHOOT AT SOMETHING. SEND VIDEO. - Wait! - Let's go! Shit, that was heavy. Yeah, what the fuck? I lost my breath. Look. Do you feel it? Yeah... Now feel mine. Do you feel it? Yes... Do you think I killed that guy? Does it freak you out or what? I don't know... What if he had a family or kids? I don't really think he died. Maybe if you had shot him on the chest or on the head. I shot him on the belly. Here. Yeah, that's what I mean. Hey, Felix. I like you very much. OK... And do you like me? Yes. Very much? Yeah, very much. A lot? Yes, a lot... Yeah, but... You look at me and what do you think? Do you think I'm pretty or...? Yes... I think you're pretty. Your face is pretty. Even without eyebrows? Yeah, even without eyebrows. I like having a girlfriend with no eyebrows. I mean... I've never met anyone who has a girlfriend with no eyebrows. So I'm your girlfriend? I think so. What do you say? I say that I also like having a boyfriend with no eyebrows. So there it is. Would you like killing ourselves together? I don't know. You think that's allowed? I think it is. Yeah? I'm concerned about the administrator... What if he gets upset and... even though we're dead, he gets our families killed? I really don't think he cares. So? Would you like to die with me? Sure, OK. How would you like us to kill ourselves? I don't know. How would you like to do it? I don't know. We could get in a bathtub together. It would be extremely romantic. With bubbles, so when they find us they don't think we were sad and depressed. Yes. It sounds cool. OK. But how? They eat proper meat? I mean, yes and no. They eat insects. OK. But they have to be alive, because otherwise... They're no good to them. And the Venus, the famous one, she has like a mouth... and inside she has these little hairs... which are like sensors. And if I put my finger inside... and touch these hairs, she like feels me and closes her mouth as if I were a fly. - How cool! - But it doesn't hurt at all... - And I also have... - I live here. You want me to come in? No, Oswaldo and my mom are about to arrive. OK. OK, but will I see you tomorrow? OK. Skip school and I'll meet you at the train. And we'll go somewhere. OK. OK. - Bye. - Bye. It's me. Yes? Hello! Does Elisa Rivera live here? No, not here. But I think there's an Elisa at 303. Thank you. What are you doing here? Nothing, I missed you. You missed me? Good night. Good night. Is there something you need? Er, no. No, I made a mistake. I'm going to the next floor. Hey... Who are you going with? With the neighbours from 403. - Elisa! - They're waiting for me. What the hell happened to your eyebrows? - Oswaldo, can you come and see this? - What happened? - Hello. - Hello. Where do you want to go? I don't know. Want to go to my house? OK. OK. - Let's go. - Let's go. Is that your dad? Yes. Did you get along? Yes. I miss my dad very much. And that? Are you into that? More or less. I'm still learning. Do you want to see? Let's see. You want to try? No. I'll just watch from here. Do you want to make love with me? OK. Really? Yes. OK. Your whale looks cool. It looks better than mine. Mine looks like a dick. Yeah. I'll close the door. Hey... Had you ever been with someone before? No. I mean... more or less. How more or less? With that Oswaldo? More or less. What do you mean 'more or less'? Please, don't ask me about Oswaldo. You're very sweet. Do you want to make love with me again? OK. Finished? How do I look? Super gorgeous. Done. Yeah? How do I look? Super gorgeous. Like evil... OK. Felix. May I come in? Yeah, come in. What's up? What are you watching? A video of a guy shooting at some assholes. OK. What's up? Felix/Elisa, I got a call from school today. Where did you go today? To the movies. - Did you go with someone? - I went skating. - No, I went alone. - With your mystery boyfriend? Felix, tell me the truth... - Do you have a girlfriend? - I don't have a boyfriend. - No, I don't have a girlfriend. - Look, Elisa... Because there's nothing wrong with having a girlfriend. Wouldn't you like to go back to the psychologist? I know, but I don't have a girlfriend. I think it might be good if you talked to her. Right, Oswaldo? - I think so too. - OK, let's leave it at that. I don't think so. - Think about it at least. - What? Nothing. OK, mom, I'll think about it. Just promise me you'll go to school tomorrow. - You promise? - Yes, I promise. Yes, mom, I promise. And also promise you'll go to school tomorrow. Yes, mom, I promise. KILL SOMEONE EVIL. SEND PICTURE. What have you thought about the challenge? It's really tough. Are you going to do it? I will. You're going to kill Oswaldo? I think so. I don't know a worst piece of shit. That's the problem. I really don't know anyone bad enough to kill him. Your mom? Come on. My mom's always bitching about everything but she's not evil. We can both kill Oswaldo if you want to. You think that's allowed? I think so. Alright, let's do it. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. OK. What? I don't know. I feel excited somehow... knowing we're going to kill someone and that we'll die together. I'm really glad we met. Do you like being my girlfriend? Very much. Me too. Do you love me? Yes. Very much? Very much. Very very very much? Very very very much. I care for you very very much. Are you in love with me? Yeah, I'm in love with you. I'm also in love with you. What about these? They're too big, aren't they? Don't you have others more... normal? And these? Yeah, those are better. At what time does Oswaldo arrive? I don't know. I think around 7:00. It's still a while. Yeah. What do you want to do in the meantime? Do you want to make love with me? I don't know. Really? Nah, I'm fucking with you. I do know. Yeah, of course I want to. And do you want to do it here or in the bedroom? Better in your room. OK. Good night. Why does it smell like cigarette so much? Good night. Good night. I know you, don't I? Of course. You were here two nights ago... going with the neighbours upstairs. You wouldn't be perhaps... Elisa's mysterious friend? Your name is Felix, isn't it? Yes, sir. Now, Felix... really... are you only friends with Elisa? Or are you her boyfriend? I'm her boyfriend. Didn't you say you didn't have a boyfriend, Elisa? Well, now I do. And... what's up with the eyebrows, Felix? Nothing, I took them off. Yeah, why? I don't know. Just because? And what about the gloves? I like them. Yeah, Elisa likes them too... Right? Would you mind taking them off? Why do you want me to take them off? Just because. I want to... to see your hands. May I? And the other side? Fuck. I thought I was going to find some tattoos but what is that? It's a game. A game... Let's see. Take off your gloves, Elisa. Please. OK. And... and you say this is a game? Yes. It's a Russian game. It's called "The Blue Whale Game." A game... Russian and kind of Emo, isn't it? No. No, we're not Emos. We are blue whales. Look. What's that? Of course. It's a whale! Yes, it's a blue whale. Well, if you say so. And did you do another one just like that, Elisa? Yes. Let's see. Oh, well, yours is prettier. How come you're cutting yourselves like that, like fucking Emos? It's because of the game. It's a challenge game. They ask you to cut yourself. But sometimes they ask you to do other things. There are 50 challenges and at the end you have to kill yourself. OK. And who's giving the challenges? The administrator. And who is the administrator? He's the one who gives the challenges. Yeah, I already got that, but who is the administrator? Is he a friend of yours? No. I don't know him. I only chat with him. And do you know him, Elisa? No. You don't... And what else does he ask of you? Many things. Like what things? Sexual things? Doing stuff between you like filming or taking nude pictures? No. Illegal stuff. More or less. How 'more or less'? They tell you to take drugs? No. And what happened to your head, Felix? Why do you have band aids? In one of the challenges I stapled myself. What? What do you mean you stapled yourself... with a stapler? Well, yeah. Fuck, man! Fuck! Are you for real? And where are you going? I'm going to the kitchen. I'm thirsty. So... you say that... that it's a game... And that the final challenge is to kill yourselves. Yes. And what happens if you don't kill yourselves? If you repent or change your minds? The administrator sends hitmen to your house to kill your family. Russian hitmen. Russian hitmen... Oh, crap. Then Elisa's mom and I are already dead... since this girlfriend of yours is too dumb to kill herself. I still can't believe what you're telling me. I'm not telling you lies. No, I'm not saying you're telling lies... I'm positive you believe all this shit you're telling me. But what I believe... is that you and Elisa have very deep psychological problems. That's it? I don't know. He went for the gun. Come. Don't come closer. Fucking assholes. That gun has no bullets. I told you it wasn't loaded. I think he's already dead. Elisa! Stop! Are you OK? Yeah. You? Yeah, I'm cool. I'm going for a drink. You want one? Yes. Yeah, OK. Whisky? OK. Can I tell you something? Can I see your cell phone? Yeah, but can I tell you something first? OK, just let me see your cell phone first. It must be my mom. No, I don't think so. Show me. Are you mad? Felix? No. No, I'm not mad. I don't believe you. What are you thinking? Are you playing this stupid game? No. You don't have an administrator, someone to give you challenges? No. How did you find me? Well, I invited people and... You said yes and that was that. And how many more said yes? With you, two. You're playing with another guy? No... I played. But I didn't like him and I stopped giving him challenges. You've never done any challenge. No. And your cuts? What about those? Can I tell you something? Just tell me about your cuts to know what the fuck is wrong with you. I made them after meeting you. Why? Will you let me tell you something? Yes. Do you remember when I told you I slit my wrists? And my mom came and took me to the hospital... There's something I didn't tell you. Mom? Come. What's wrong, Elisa? I'm in the kitchen Mom... Elisa, what did you do? Why did you repent? I don't know... I got scared. I felt lonely. Was Oswaldo really a bad person? Yes. - You're not lying to me? - No. How bad? Don't ask me about Oswaldo. OK. Hey, Felix... Do you still want to die with me? I ask you because... If you don't want to, maybe you could stay with me... just until I die, so I don't get scared. No, I want to die with you. I don't have anything to do here without you. I also want to die with you. What's wrong? I don't know... When I saw you get angry, I thought... that you wouldn't want to die with me anymore. I'm sorry. It's OK. I want to. So then, how do you want to do it? You want us to cut our veins as we said or... what do you want to do now? Yes, let's cut ourselves like you said... We get in the bathtub... With bubbles... So when they find us they don't say we were sad and depressed. OK. OK. You want to do it right now? Yes... but first let's do the notes. Do you want to read it? I don't want my mom to miss him. Can I read your letter? Yes, but mine is rather stupid. "Mom: please feed my plants. Felix." It's my mom. - Hi? - Where are you? At the house. Did you go to school today? Yes, mom, I did. OK. Is Oswaldo there with you? No, he's not home yet. Elisa, what we talked about last night, about the psychologist... Have you thought about it? More or less. And what have you thought 'more or less'? That I want to give it more thought. OK. Are you going out? I still don't know. Elisa, can I ask you a favor? Don't go out. Wait for me at home. I'm about to leave the hospital. And I would like to speak with you. Will you wait for me so we can talk? But seriously, darling, promise me you will wait for me at home... Yes, mom, I promise. OK, I'll see you in a while then. OK. - Hey, can I tell you something? - Yes... I love you very much. I also love you very much. We'll talk when I get home. My mom will be home soon. We better go kill ourselves. Ready? I don't know. You? Almost. Come. Ready? OK. Here I go. Does it hurt? More or less. Not so much now. Sure? Sure. Did you cut yourself? No. Why not? I don't know. Don't leave me alone, Felix. Don't leave me alone. No, I won't leave you alone. Did you do it? Yes. See? It doesn't hurt at all. No, it doesn't hurt. I feel like I'm going away. I'm still more "here" than "there". Don't leave me alone. I'll see you in a while. See you. Felix... Felix... Felix, son... Felix, you have a visitor. Hello, Felix. This man is a psychologist. He's from the hospital. He's going to give you a psychological test. Look, Felix, what we want to assess is your current emotional state.

Very well. I'm going to read the first statement... and you're going to tell me if it's true or false. "Felix is a good boy." "Felix is a good boy." True or false, Felix? Are you a good boy? True. I'm going to read the next one to you... "Felix is angry and agitated". False. "Felix feels useless and is ashamed of himself." False. "Felix feels guilty and thinks he should be punished." False. "Felix feels restless and uneasy." False. "Felix feels hopeful about the future." True. 35 MINUTES AND 270 STATEMENTS LATER "Felix is more irritable than usual." False. "Felix feels that everyone would be better if he was dead." False. "Felix does not think clearly." False. "Felix feels that life is worth living." True. "Felix is happy." True.
