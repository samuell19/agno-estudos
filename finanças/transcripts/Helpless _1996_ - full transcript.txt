They are also nice. I just took them. What is it? Mountains here. Inside the tunnel. You've never checked the wall. I forgot it. What? Time for TV. Ice coffee. She's an idiot. Scary. No. No sound. That's it. You like it with no sound? Better with sound? You like pictures only. It's the same for idiots. What are you doing? We? I know the boss, Sakanashi. A gang member's sister. They were here before. What're you up to? I don't know anything. Tell me what! I don't know. I'll check. What? I'll check. Hurts. Don't underestimate me! What the hell! Pay for it. Good timing. Without you, he'd have killed me. It took time. How come? Are you with me? Hey. Shut up. What is it? Who is this idiot? Is this social work? Gross. Did you watch "Prisoner 6"?

Leave now. Never mind. It's OK. What's inside? Never mind. Hey, I'll beat you! Hurts. Easy. Stop insisting! You didn't hurt me. You wanted to? Just pretending. I know. You just wanted to tease me. That was awful. You country bumpkins. Stop! What's wrong! Your mind is screwed up. No wonder they didn't like you. Still... I see. Ouch. Why smile! Go outside to fight! What are you up to? Nothing to do with you. Not really. I was almost killed 'cause of it. What? He tried to see it. I resisted. Why did he... Who cares. She's yakuza's sister. Why not say it earlier! It's my place! What! Making your face! Call police! You punk. Crazy! Damn. Don't snub me. My dad... Stop! Akihiko. Bring a rope. Stop! Ouch... You said you'd forgive me. No meaning. You mean... Bother you? You're chicken. What! Interesting. What? Revenge. What do you mean? Class reunion. I'll poison the juice. Beer sounds better. I mean it. He doesn't ask you to join. I decide. I won't ask you. Why not? Forgiveness. Why? Helped find my shorts. Not to see your ass. It's OK. I must join. No. I must go. You watch TV at home. See, hurts? You can't forgive me. Right? Look at your eyes. Coward. You mother fucker! Shut up! Fuck you! You're weak! What! Don't fight. Make him quiet. He drives me crazy. I'm no wimp! You're weaker than a woman. Hurts! Stop! Stop kicking me. Stop it! You... You! Dead? You killed them. Take a memorial picture. Smile. Memorial picture. Should've taken dad too. Take the picture at the reunion also. After poisoning them. No good. Here they come. Hurry up! What the... Killed'em... ridiculed me. Let's go. And him? Never mind. It's yours. How come? Take it. Let's go together. To where? Q...Q... What's wrong! You kill her. Selfish bastard! So selfish. You can't push only your way. She's poor by herself. It's your own cause. Bastard! Q... No, Q! Shoot if you can. Everything you need's on the shelf. Please get rid of my things...
