Oh my gosh, this is my fifth Kids' Choice Award. Thank you all so much for voting for me always, for supporting me always. Thank you so much, Nickelodeon, for being my family. You know, these past-- oh my goodness, these past three and a half years with Nickelodeon have been some of the best times of my life. I have fun every single day getting to work with them.

Who is the Kids' Choice Favorite Female Social Star? Ah! Annie LeBlanc! Congrats, Annie, on your first-ever Kids' Choice Award. - Hey, guys. It's Annie, here. And I am currently holding a Nickelodeon Blimp in my hand as I'm giving my first-ever acceptance speech. So first and foremost, I have to thank my incredible fans for voting for me and for supporting me through everything. I literally would not be here without you guys. You guys did this, so we are accepting this award together today. So once again, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you. You guys are awesome. - Okay, this year, for the first time ever, we launched slime into space. How cool is that? Insane. So let's head up to the International Space Station and see what our astronauts got up to with their slime shipment in zero gravity. Check it out. - Welcome aboard! This is Team Slime. I am Luca. - And I'm Christina. - And today, we're gonna be working some very crazy science with slime in space. So we want to see and study how this, uh, strange, uh, concoction behaves in the orbit. So, uh, let's, uh--let's have some fun and excitement. - We're breaking free! - ♪ - Boom! Houston, we have a slime blob. Okay, we're gonna try and rotate the blob. - ♪ - Whoa! - Woo-hoo. Aah! I got slimed! [laughs] - Slime in space! - MAN: [laughs] - Playing with slime in space is way more fun than I thought it was gonna be, and way more unpredictable. Oh no! [laughs] - LUCA: Oh, wow. - That is so awesome! Just like all the other science we do, you cannot replicate these experiments on the earth. You need zero gravity to see some of this behavior. - The International Space Station is the only place where you can do this, so don't try this at home. Or if you try, expect something very, very different. - CHRISTINA: Exactly. Woo-hoo! [laughs] I think we should keep our little friend, the slime ball, around. - And that's what happens when you send slime into space. But what happens when you accidently send some kids into space? Right now, here's an exclusive world premiere clip of the new Nickelodeon show, "The Astronauts." - MAN: In three days, Odyssey 2 will embark on the most significant mission in the history of mankind. - This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal. We gotta do this. - I can't believe we're sneaking on! - Whoa! - This is so cool! - COMPUTER: Welcome aboard Odyssey 2. - [screaming] - COMPUTER: Commencing launch sequence. - Get me out of here! - Everybody strap in! - ♪ - Our kids are inside there. - ♪ - We're kids. We're not trained. - We just wanna go home. - COMPUTER: Failure in 31 minutes. - We're gonna die in 31 minutes? - We can do this. - Friends stick together. - Whoo! - Oh! - ♪ - Hello? - I have so many questions. Like, what's gonna happen to those astronauts? How will they make it back from space? I guess we're gonna have to keep it here on Nick to find out. But lucky for all of you, we don't have to wait any longer to find out what your Favorite Movie was. - ANNOUNCER: The nominees for Favorite Movie are... "Aladdin." - Oh, great one who summons me, I stand by my oath: loyalty to wishes three. I'm kidding. Watch this. - ANNOUNCER: "Avengers: Endgame." - Assemble. - [yelling] - ANNOUNCER: "Captain Marvel." - I'm not what you think I am. - [rumbling] - ANNOUNCER: "Jumanji: The Next Level." - What in tarnation? - Spencer. - Spencer? - My god... - Are we in Florida? - ANNOUNCER: "Spider-Man: Far from Home." - [explosions] - [grunts] - ANNOUNCER: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker." - ♪ - [moans] - Can we fly now? - Fly now. - And the winning movie is... - [drumroll] - This is so exciting. "Avengers: Endgame"! Whoo! - Hey, guys. Oh my gosh, this is such a thrill. We are so excited. We are so happy that the Kids' Choice Awards are still happening. - Oh, yeah, that's right. The show must go on, right? Life must go on. And therefore, the Avengers must go on. - We'd like to dedicate this award to all the kids who rooted for these characters to assemble and become what we all need to be right now: stronger together. - That's right, guys. You kids, you're the absolute greatest. We are stronger together. And amongst this group, I'm the strongest, obviously. But we know that, so... - Well...debatable, isn't it? I seem to recall beating you in a push-up contest. - Oh! Pretty sure I was wearing the big suit full of [unintelligible] and the 70-pound weight that I had on my back and my stomach, so it doesn't count. - Sounds like an excuse. - This was my life for a decade, so... - Seems like. Lucky I'm not in there in person-- - Oh! - Robert? - Hi! - Hey! I thought you were, uh... - What? Social distancing? Aren't we all? - [cricket chirping] - All right, you guys ready to wrap this up? - Sure. - Let's--okay, great. All right, three, two, one, go-- - Stay safe. Stay strong. - That's right, guys. We're stronger together. We'll get through this. - Whatever it takes. - Love you 3000. - Love ya! - We love you 3000. - Bye, guys! - Yeah, Nickelodeon! Whoo! - Congrats, Avengers! And sadly, we have reached the endgame of tonight's show as well. for more information on the amazing work this organization is doing to provide resources and to find out how your family can help. I've had a blast tonight. Thank you to everyone for joining us. And a special thank you to all of the healthcare and essential workers who are out there taking care of all of us. And let's not forget you guys, because without kids, there is no Kids' Choice. And now there's only one thing left to do. You know what? I think we're gonna need some more slime. Maddy, get over here. I'm not doing this alone. - I got you. - Can you hold this for me? - Of course. - [screaming] - Oh my god! - [screaming] - Oh my god! - [screaming] - ♪ We're in this together, an infinite high ♪ ♪ And we can keep on dancing all night ♪ ♪ We don't need forever ♪ But now it feels right ♪ Yeah, we can keep on dancing all night ♪♪ - [Nickelodeon theme]
