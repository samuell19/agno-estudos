You're taking the complaint out of your pocket and giving it to me like a love letter. What's your complaint, tell me. That is...I am continuously receiving threatening calls. Is it? Are you a big shot to receive such threatening calls? I write a lot. Oh! I also write a lot. Do you write on a wall or a paper? No, sir. I'm a novelist. Oh, okay. Whom did you write about to get threatening calls? I don't write about personalities. I write fictional stories based on my imagination. Now, all my fictional characters are calling and threatening me. Fictional characters? Yes, sir. I wrote a story about twin murders that happen in Anna Nagar. The one who got caught in that murder... ...calls me and threatens to say he was caught because of the story, I wrote. Poor guy, he didn't get bail. So, the cops have closed the case with the help of your story, right? Yes, sir. So, the cops are wastrels, right? No... Brother, are you listening? I'm listening, tell me. Sir, many cases are still pending here. Can you solve it for us? You are talking as if that's my job. Can't you see him? He is intoxicated. Sir, listen to me! Why?

I'll talk to you later. At 2.30 am, a girl named Pooja called the control room. She said that someone is chasing her and that she's in danger. She said Subramaniam, Sai Nagar. I have come to enquire about you, regarding that. Who's that girl? What's the relationship between the two of you? So, you didn't come for my security. Oh, no… You've come to enquire me, since some girl said about me. But you're not bothered about my complaint, isn't it? Okay, you said you received threatening calls, from whom did you get the calls? Show me the number from which you received the call. Just a minute. Sir, even last night he was drunk and tortured me like this. Check properly, sir. I got a call at 3 a.m., sir. Check it.

Three people chase her, she calls the cops to inform them that she's in danger. A guy switches on the torch at the same time. Then? Then, the power goes off. Sir, he is lying. The torch will be switched on after the power goes off, right? How will the power go off after switching on the torch? Sir, I'm writing this story since last night. Pooja is a character in my story. See here. Check whether it's right. Yes, sir. The character's name is Pooja, she is chased by three people. Everything is written as said, sir. Who is Pooja? Who are those three people? Where did you hide her? I hid her? What are you saying? So, what you wrote is a story? You don't know anything about the girl? I don't know anything, sir. Hey, take him into custody. Just wait. Do you have a warrant to take me into custody? Tell me. If you don't have a warrant, arrange for a press meet... And tell me why you are taking me into custody and then proceed. What?

You should give respect to me. Move away... -Better come. This is ridiculous. -Sir, where are you taking him? -Tell us, sir. Hey, you don't need to know that. Go away. Hey, switch off the phone. -Tell us, Sir. Hey, you take the video. -Sir, tell us. -Where are you taking him? Tell us the reason and take him along. What? Do you want me to tell you the reason? (Indistinct voices) Hey, why are you shouting? Sir, what wrong he did do for you to take him? Are you creating a ruckus? At least tell us where are you taking him? Hey, come. -Sir, take off your hands. Sir, this is not fair. Hey, are you taking a video? -Why are you hitting me, sir? Leave us. I'll smash your face. Better be careful. Hey, go away.

Last night, I lodged a complaint seeking protection for me. Now, they've come to take me. Don't worry, sir. We'll take care. Tell us if they trouble you. Thanks! Good morning, mam. Mam is in a meeting. She asked you to wait for a few minutes. Okay. Till the election gets over, nobody will be granted personal holidays or leaves. ACPs and Commissioners, should be on standby 24x7. Even if it's a small issue, handle it carefully. Don't take anything lightly! Don't give space to the media and the opposition... ...to talk about us or our department. Yes, mam. Especially, two weeks before the election... I want everyone to be cautious, alert and vigilant. Sure, mam. Okay, then. Thank you. Mam! Wait a minute, please. Hey, it's unnecessary for you, go away. Hey, switch off the cell phone. Hey, switch off the cell phone. Hey, switch off the cell phone. Hey, move away. Are you creating a ruckus? Why are you exaggerating? Hey, how dare you? Hey, switch off the video. Sai Nagar comes under whose limit? It's mine, mam. What's happening there? A kidnap case, mam. Can you please brief me? At 2.30 a.m., a girl called the control room saying that someone was chasing her. Subramaniam the name of a novelist was also mentioned, mam. He has written the same incident as a story, mam. As soon as I got the information, I asked our cops to enquire, mam. So, you directly took him into custody. Yes, mam. Ask them to meet me in the Chamber. The famous senior writer from the city... ...was arrested atrociously by the cops. The public was protesting against the cops, and the situation was very tense. The cops were furious with the youngsters who shot the video... The cops and the youths were involved in a heated argument. All these incidents are going viral on social media. He said the characters in the story are threatening him. Is this believable? He should be taken to the hospital, Instead, you've taken him into custody. First of all, tell me... What was the basis on which you were trying to take him into custody? No, mam. The girl said his name, that's why. He has also written about the incident exactly. Okay, if suppose someone calls me and says that you've mental issues, Shall I admit you to the asylum? Okay, you leave it. You tell me... To enquire about a missing case, what's the basic requirement? Missing complaint of the girl. Complaint by the girl. Proof of the crime and Concrete evidence, mam. Then why are you unnecessarily turning this issue into a sensation. Mam, we received an order to enquire. When the girl called the control room, Did she say that he was the one who kidnapped her? Did someone file a complaint that this girl is missing? Or complained that he was the suspect? No, right? We couldn't even trace the number from which we received the call. What if it was a prank call? When we heard the girl's voice it didn't seem to be a prank call, mam. Let me listen to the recording. Hello! Control room! Three people are chasing me. I don't know where I am. It's an emergency. I need help. I'm DG... Please play that again. -Okay, mam. Hello! Control room! Three people are chasing me. I don't know where I am. It's an emergency. I need help. I'm DG... Call Pooja now. Her phone is switched off, mam. Call home. Did she call you yesterday and say anything? No mam, I didn't receive any call. Hello! Hello! -Tell me, sir. Is Pooja there in the room? No, sir. Did she come home? No, sir. Oh, okay! She didn't come home, mam. Call her friend Anitha. -Okay, mam. You said that there were two calls to the control room, right? Yes, mam. Play it. I'm Pooja, Subramaniam, Sai Nagar. Mam, Anitha's number is also switched off. Send someone immediately. Okay, mam. Take that person into custody immediately. I'm speaking from DGP's office. Yes, mam. Send someone immediately to Pooja mam's office... ...and enquire when she left the office yesterday and with whom? Okay, do it immediately. Send Pooja's car details to all Patrols and check-posts. Okay Ma'am. If you find anyone suspicious, take the person to the warehouse and interrogate them. Okay, mam. Tell me, sir. What happened? Why are they trying to arrest you? Hey, go out. Go away ...go away... Hey, leave. Go out. -Two minutes Sir. Move...move... -Get up. Go out. -Hey, leave. Why are you sending him out? -Go out. Go, go... -Go out. Hey, go out. What's this, sir? -Go... Tell me, where have you hidden the girl? Hey! Where is that girl? Instead of asking the girl when she called, Why are you asking me repeatedly? Are you seeking media publicity by kidnapping DGP's daughter? Does it feel like I am sitting here to tell you a story? Sir! If the pull the trigger, your head will blow up into pieces. Hey, tell me, where is the girl? Sir, the press people are taking photos. Sir, why don't you believe me when I say that I don't know. Hey, get up. Why are you doing this always? Leave me, sir. Please! Hey, Move aside. Move away...move away... Sir! You are back here again. (Indistinct voices) Move aside. Sir, where are you taking him? Hey, get lost. -Start the vehicle. Tell us, sir. Move away. The arrogant cops towards media representatives. They threatened the writer with a pistol and asked him to surrender. The cops attacked the writer's house again. When he was talking to the media... ...the cops entered his house and threatened him with a gun and asked him to surrender. The DGP's incompetence is said to be the main reason for the police atrocities. Mam, Anitha has shifted to a new house. I have asked to find out the address. Mam, call from the CM office. Sir! Asha, what's happening? When you can't take care of your daughter, How will you protect the public? Who is the ACP who pointed the pistol? Doesn't he have sense? Who sent him there? First, release the writer. Until the PM completes his visit, news about your daughter shouldn't be leaked to the media. Ensure that the media stays silent. Yes, sir. I'll take care of that. Go to the writer's house. This way, mam. Right side, mam. Wait here. Good morning, mam! Sir, get up. Sir! Sir! He shouldn't move from here. Keep me updated on everything that is happening. Okay, mam. Sir, A higher official came to see you. Why didn't you stand up and give her respect? Hey, I know. Thank you all for coming. Since today morning... ...the breaking news is that my daughter has been missing. I want to tell everyone that this is baseless and not true. After seeing the harsh handling of Subramaniam by the police department. I have come to apologize to him personally on behalf of the department. Mam, your department cops have pointed the pistol at Subramaniam to scare him. Is this act justifiable? Pointing the pistol at the public is wrong. There will be a departmental enquiry on him. The ACP has been suspended immediately. So, your daughter is not missing, right? Also, what's the necessity to arrest Subramaniam sir? My daughter is on a personal vacation, she will be back in two days. Mam, the Commissioner should've come to apologize, right? Why did you come to apologize? Since my daughter's name is connected in this case... I had to come here personally. Mam is there any connection between the story he wrote and the incident? Mam, we have an urgent meeting. Okay, thank you, everyone. -Mam, a final question. -Answer us, mam. Check the writer's background thoroughly and update me. Okay, mam. Inform that it's a general medical check-up and get him analysed by a psychiatrist. Okay, mam. Okay, find out if he has any relatives. What? Isn't there anyone for him? Okay, at least do you know where does he work? Good morning, mam. What can I do for you? Kalyan. I am stuck in an emergency. I need an undercover officer immediately. What's the purpose, mam? This is my personal issue. That's why I'm not in a position to take help from the officers of this state. And Kalyan... This is a very confidential matter. Sure, mam. I'll definitely appoint an officer with the qualifications you expect. Just relax now. Mr. Chetan. Yes, mam. You'll receive the details of an undercover officer now. Arrange for his arrival immediately. Okay, mam. Did you get any information about writer Subramaniam? Mam, it has been six months since he came here. No one knows where he was before. Hello! Sir! Mam asked me to inform whatever he writes. He has written again, sir. Mam, the constable who is with the writer has called. He has written something again. What has he written? Read it now. A remarkable police officer known for the safety of women... ...Lost her daughter and is awaiting the arrival of another officer named Vikram Kumar. Will he be able to save Pooja before anything harmful happens to her? Give me the phone. Hello, Kalyan! What's the name of the officer you're going to send? His name is Vikram Kumar, mam. For what reason have you arrested them? Sir, last week in a shopping mall, they have passed lewd comments on Pooja. The cops arrested them, took them to the police station and thrash them, sir. Did you arrest them thinking they'd have kidnapped her in that rage? Yes, sir. Untie them. Did you track the GPS of their phones while they kidnapped... ...and speak to the people whom they contacted? No, sir. As we have guns in our hands... Irrespective of whom we shoot. No one has the guts to question us. It's that arrogance... which leads to the arrest of such innocents. Disgusting. Sir! Mam! Did they say anything? Mam, they are not related to Pooja's missing case in any way. Then ask all of them to leave. Take them away. Asha Pramod. Vikram Kumar. Hope you got the complete details about the case. Yes, mam. So, from where you are going to start the investigation? Exactly from you, mam. What! You became aware of your daughter's disappearance only after everyone else knew about it. So, this kidnapping may even be your plan. You're right, Mr. Vikram. Because you doubted me, I got the hope that the right person has come. I came to know late that my daughter is missing because... While I'm at home, she'll be in the office. She'll be at home when I'm in the office. So, we'll meet only at weekends. Where does she work? She works at Trice and Corporation as a financial analyst. When did you last speak to Pooja, before she went missing? As she had a party with her office colleagues she said that she'll come home late. She told me not to wake her up early in the morning. I thought she might've come home late from the party and would be sleeping, So, I left for the office. without waking her up. In the morning, when I came to that she was missing, I tried to call her on phone. It was not reachable. It doesn't seem like a random kidnapping So, who do you think could've done this kidnapping, Mr.Vikram? Simple, mam. If done for money, you'd have got a phone call by this time. If it was done out of hatred. ...they'd have tortured your daughter and sent you that video. Yes. If you think Subramaniam could've done this and is pretending now. The characters he has written in his story... ...are giving him threatening calls, So, he has lodged a complaint at the police station. Yes. That's why I asked the cops to check Subramaniam with a psychiatrist. If you want your daughter to return home safely... I need the freedom to do my work. I have my own law and order. No one should question me and no one should hinder my work. I don't know what you will do and how you will do it. I want my daughter back safely. Okay, mam. I need two trainees to assist me. Also, I need a vehicle, a cell phone and a pistol to handle this case. Sure. Everything will be arranged. I'm leaving. He'll assist you with everything. What's this? It's a sand clock. I asked, what's this? It's an image. Tell me what image is this? I'm drunk, so it looks blur. Look properly and tell me. Looks like a camel. Don't know whether it's a male or female. What age would it be? That you've to ask the camel, sir. Since when have you been writing this story? Since last night. In my story, there's a doctor character like you wearing specs. But I don't know what will happen to him in the end. Hello! -Sir, Dr.Kasi. Okay. -Sir... A call from the psychiatrist. Tell me, doctor. He seems to be perfectly alright, sir. No trace of any abnormality in the brain. Schizophrenia, Illusional and multiple personality disorder... Are there any symptoms like this, doctor? I've tested him keeping in mind all those things... But definitely, it's not that, sir. Then, why is he behaving this way, doctor? Actually, the creative side of his brain is very active sir. Either he should be acting smart... ...or it should be beyond the psychological understanding. It might be an ESP. (Extrasensory perception) which enables the sensing of future events in advance. But it's very difficult to find it in the analytics that we do. We have to conduct a lot of other tests. Okay. Thank you, doctor. It's okay, sir. Sir! The constable who is the writer is on the call. Hello, did he write anything again? Sir, your voice is different. I'm Special Officer Vikram Kumar speaking. Greetings, sir. What's the status there? He isn't bothered about anything and listening to songs, sir. Where is his cell phone? It's with me, sir. Okay good, if anyone calls him, ask him to switch on the speaker and talk. Okay, Sure, sir. Nobody should meet him without my permission. Whatever he writes must be conveyed to me first. Did you understand? -Okay, sir. Sir, if you meet him once you might get some clue, right? We can get at clue at the crime spot not at the table of the writer. Chetan sir, how long have you been working for mam? Almost ten years, sir. Mr. Chetan, precisely it's nine years, eight months, eleven days. You're residing at Ashok Nagar, 92nd street... ...and your children are studying in Kendriya Vidyalaya. Am I right? Sir, Pooja mam's case details. Sir. Sir. Does Pooja regularly go to parties at night? Sir, I'm the PA for DGP and not for Pooja. Yes, sir! What is he doing now? Sir, he boozed heavily, His bladder is full it seems, so he went to the restroom, sir. I think someone is giving him clues from outside. Sir, his cell phone is with me. No... no... He is doing something. You immediately check the restroom. Edukondalu, check the house completely. Okay, sir. Sir! Sir, come out soon. Won't you let me use the restroom in peace? Sir, I'm calling you only. What is it? What do you want? Nothing sir... ...an order from a higher official to check your restroom once. Senseless fellows! What do you hope to find in the restroom? Keep searching... Is it over? Edukondalu. Sir, it's me. Did you get any clue? I have checked completely sir. I checked everything and cleared even the drainage blocks, sir. Did you check his ears? What! You mean ears! Yes, ears. Did he tell to check my ears? Better tell him that you will check my nose and mouth too. Are you a cop or an ENT doctor? I too don't understand, sir. -Come, check me. Sir. -Did you check? Sir, I'm able to see the other side of the ear. There is nothing as you suspect, sir. Good morning, sir. Sir, I'm Mathew, Chief security officer.

Let's move. Sir, I'm Ramya. Let me come straight to the point. Your friend Pooja is missing. Sir, I saw something else in news. The fact is far from the news. She is missing. Where did you, Pooja and Anitha go last night in Pooja's car? We went to the party hosted by our colleague Kishore. How about the relationship between you and Pooja? We are just colleagues. She is our team manager. Who is Pooja's best friend in your office? Anitha, sir. Call Anitha now. Just a minute. Pallavi... Yes, sir. Hello! Good evening, sir. What is he doing? Just a minute. He is writing something, sir. Read quickly what he has written. Vikram begins the investigation with Ramya. He asks the details about Pooja. As asked by Vikram, Ramya calls Anitha. Anitha, where are you? On the way, Ramya. I waited for Pooja. As her cell phone is switched off, I'm coming by cab. She is... She is travelling in the car TN21 BA 1488. Sir, he has even written the vehicle number. It's very surprising, sir! He is not an ordinary guy, sir. Repeat it. -TN21 BA 1488 Sir, she is on the way. Pooja's cell phone is switched off. So, she is coming by cab. Call Anitha and get the cab details and its number. Switch on the speaker. Tell me, Ramya. Anitha, tell me the number of the cab in which you are coming. Why are you asking the cab number? Tell me first. TN21 BA 1488 Okay, bye. Sit. How did Pooja behave in the party yesterday? She was in good spirit while going to the party, sir. But midway through the party she was a little disappointed. Why? What happened? Myself and Anitha were talking casually. -You should've seen his face then... -He ran away. -Is it? I didn't expect it. -I too didn't expect. The arrangements are rocking! Hey, hi! This is my fiancée. -Hi. This is Ramya, my good friend. -Finally, your dream came true. Hey, just wait. My fiancée is here. Congrats! -Thank you. She is Anitha! -Hi! Wonder how someone accepted you as a bridegroom. Anyway, congratulations! -Thank you. They're jealous because they didn't get me. You're so lucky! He is acting over-smart. Hi, Pooja! She is the luckiest person. -What! Do you know how? She is my fiancée. Congratulations! Thank you. Okay, enjoy the party. You go. Hello! Hello! Hello! Can you hear me? I'll slap you if you don't speak with respect. Hey, you... Hey, I'll take revenge on you. See, what am I going to do now? This is why, I don't attend parties. What happened, Pooja? Hey, wait. -Okay, bye. Who was the guy who disturbed Pooja at the party? I don't know who he is, sir. What happened later? Pooja and Anitha left the party. I know only up to this, sir. Who hosted the party? Kishore. I must meet him immediately. He is in an important meeting, sir. This is more important than that. Call him. Okay, sir. Sir, Anitha has reached the office. And the taxi number is matching. You can go. Praveen. -Sir. Go to the party location and collect the details from there. Okay, sir. Excuse me, sir. -Sit down. Pallavi. -Sir. We heard that you and Pooja are best friends. Yes mam, since childhood. You came to know that Pooja is missing only after coming to office, it seems. Yes, mam. Just now. When was the last time you met Pooja? Last night, when she dropped me at my house. Whom did she quarrel with, at the party last night? I don't know who he is, but he must be one of Kishore's friends. What happened later? Actually, she was very upset when we were going back in the car. When I asked what happened, instead of replying to me... She raised the volume of the music. That's when, I saw it in the rear-view mirror. A guy was following us. I told her about it but she didn't say anything. What happened? Pallavi. -Sir. After that? Pooja dropped me at my house and left, sir. The guy who mocked Pooja at the party... ...and the one who followed your car were the same? No, sir. I'm not sure. Pallavi. -Sir. Check the CCTV footage at the surroundings of Anitha's house... ...and collect the details of all the... ...vehicles which passed by at that time. Okay, sir. You can go. Sir, he is again writing something. What is he writing? Sir, the next person you're going to enquire is Kishore. Sir! Hello! Sir! Sir, I'm Kishore. What's this, sir? I'm getting married in a week. If you interrogate me at this time, what will my mother-in-law think about me? She will cancel the marriage. Marriage is my childhood dream, sir. Shall we go out and talk? Who quarrelled with Pooja at the party? Ravi, sir. How long do you know Ravi? We both studied together till college, sir. We are classmates. Why did Ravi quarrel with Pooja in your bachelor's party? How do I know, sir? But why are you asking me all that? Pooja is missing. So, what's the link between this and Ravi? Why did Ravi follow Pooja's car? That's the only exit for all from the party's location, sir. You are simply asking why he followed... Is that a question, sir? You called me seriously and now you are asking silly questions. When will you guys get updated? Are we going to the canteen, sir? Sir! Sorry sir. Please continue, sir. What is Ravi doing now? I'm not sure, he has not been in touch with me. A friend told me that he is doing a part-time job. Even for the bachelor party I posted the invite in the group, sir. I didn't expect him to come. Sir! Call Ravi. -Okay, sir. Sir, it's switched off. True, sir. I promise my mother-in-law. I want his phone number and address. I know only his phone number but not his address, sir. True, sir. Okay, sir. Sir, This is Praveen speaking -Tell me, Praveen. I have come to the party location, sir. The party is booked in the name of Kishore, sir. Did you get his phone number and other details? I got it, sir. Since it was a private party the CCTV cameras were switched off, sir. Okay, Praveen. Enquire the staff there and gather the details. Okay, sir. But the other thing is, as per cyber-crime information, Pooja's car is there at her last known place, sir. I'll share the location with you now. Okay, I'll be there. Okay, sir. Sir, Edukondalu speaking. Tell me, Edukondalu. Sir, he isn't writing anything now, So, I read his earlier stories. None of it sounds like a story. All are actual cases. Sir, a kidnapping and murder case happened in Anna Nagar in 2013. He has written it exactly as if he had witnessed the incident. The verdict of that case was given last year. But he has written it in the year 2013, sir. He has written what had happened. Hang up the phone. Sir, I believe you. Everything you write seems to be happening, sir. Then why do you write about murders and killings? You can write about good things, right? What's the speciality of crime novels? It will be thrilling until the climax. Good things will happen only at the end. Sir, why are troubling the girl for that? ...and making her mother and the cops run around? You can directly write the climax instead. You can't have the last sip at first, right? Did you inform the cops? No, sir. I've informed only the DGP. Don't know how they came here. The car is locked, sir. The front wheel has been flattened. Where does this road lead to? -It's a dead end, Sir. What do you think could have happened? Probably, the car should've got flattened. So, she must have parked it here thinking that she could take it next morning. If that's the case... Either she'd have searched for someone to repair the tyres. Or she'd have called someone for help. Both didn't happen. Are you saying she could've been kidnapped, sir? Send them all first. -Okay, sir. Guys, you may leave now. -Okay, sir. Tell me, Vikram. Why did you call me here? Don't you've faith in me? What happened? You called me as it's an undercover operation, right? Yes. Then, why did the cops come here? You could've called the press as well. No, Vikram. -Don't worry about that. -They'll just assist you. Mam... I already told you. Let me do my work. -It's not that, Vikram. Or send me back. -Vikram! In the surrounding area of this station limit... ...enquire whether any check-post or outpost was there last night. Okay, sir. I will do it right away. Sir, nothing like that was here. What could've happened, sir? What happened here was... After diverting Pooja's car from the main road. A barricade was placed. Then nails were scattered on the road to puncture the car tyre. Yes, Pallavi. Sir, I've checked the CCTV footage near Anitha's house. A bike had continuously followed Pooja's car, sir. Checked the RC papers of the bike and called the owner, sir. But he said he had sold the bike six months back, sir. I've verified and sent you the video, please check once sir. Okay. Hello, sir! The sticker on the back of the bike is torn. It seems to be related to the service centre. Enquire about it immediately. -Okay, sir. Praveen, trace out the vehicles which passed this area last night... ...if you find anyone suspicious, enquire them and update me. Okay, sir. Hey, first stop writing. Tell me, where you hid my daughter? Who is your daughter, mam? Don't you know about Pooja? Oh, your daughter's name is Pooja. Don't pretend. I know you're hiding something. You've written that my daughter Pooja is missing, right? I'm just writing a story. One of the characters is Pooja. How can you say that it's your daughter? You're a cop, right? If your daughter is missing, go and search for her. Why are you troubling me? If anything happens to my daughter, I'll not spare anyone who is behind this. Mam... If anyone has a problem they will approach the cops. But why are you telling me? Mam, now your daughter is missing. Just in case, you can't find her, You'll arrest me by filing some other case on me, Am I right mam? If all this is happening just because I'm writing... I'll not write anymore, mam. Sir, some belongings are here along with the cell phone. Why is it like this? Sir, this location has a crime history. That's why, the public entry is restricted, sir. What happened here earlier? A rape incident has happened here a year before, sir. The girl's name is Janani, sir. Where? -Exactly there. There, sir. Give me that stick. If the mobile phone is active... Someone might've thrown it just now. The one who has thrown it should be in this surrounding. Look for him. -Okay, sir. Pallavi, call the forensic team. -Yes, sir. Make it fast. Tell me. -Hello sir... The DGP mam has come. Why did she come there? Give her the phone. Okay, sir...okay... Mam, Vikram sir is on phone. Yes, Vikram. Mam, why did you go there? It's my daughter who went missing. Vikram, he is doing something. Give me some time, I'll look into it. Mam, then it's up to you. Just wait outside. -Okay, sir. Close the door and go. -Yes, sir. You seem to be a good person. But I can't understand why you are doing like this? Please tell me, where is my daughter? I'll give you the money you want. I'll not harm anyone. Please, give back my daughter. Mam, am I so young to kidnap her? I'll call you later. Sir, I've informed forensics. They're on the way. Okay. The missing girl is DGP's daughter. Who had the audacity to kidnap the State DGP's daughter? Though we tried hard, we couldn't get a clue. But we found the car suddenly... The cell phone that we are tracing is active... Finding Pooja's belongings here... It seems like someone has thrown all these here. It doesn't seem real at all. I think someone is diverting us. At the same spot of the crime that happened a year ago, Why should all this be here? I don't know what they intend to convey. Who are they? Why are they doing this? If my prediction is right... Pooja should definitely be alive. Okay, don't miss any clue. -Okay. The trio wearing a mask... ...threw a 23-year-old woman into the water... ...from the bridge and ran away. The guy who witnessed the incident... ...called the police and informed them. Call Vikram, immediately. Sir, I'm Chetan. -Tell me, Chetan. I'm listening to you. Sir, come to the broken bridge immediately. Why? The writer has written that someone has thrown the corpse of a woman there. Shit. Okay, I'm coming. Greetings, sir! He is a local fisherman. He witnessed the incident that happened here. You tell Sir what you saw exactly as you saw it. How many people were there? -What, sir? How many people were there? -Three people, sir. How did they look like? As they were wearing a mask, I couldn't see their faces. Take his details and ask him to wait. Okay, sir. Sir, nothing here. Sir, nothing was found. Sir, not here. Sir, not here. Sir, a corpse is here. Hey, come. Come. Tie it tightly. Lift up. -Have you tied well? Lift up. Pull the rope and hold tight. Hey, all of you move away. Hey, pull up. Hey, pull. -Be careful. -Constable, hold it. -Hey, come. Constable, hold it. -Come, hold it tight. -Lift up. -Hold the leg. Slowly... -Be careful. -Keep the hands inside. Bring a water bottle. Mam confirmed that the corpse wasn't Pooja. So, enquire whether a woman missing complaint has been lodged anywhere. Trace those three people... ...information given by the fisherman. Move...move... Hey! Sir! Don't hit me. Why are you hitting me, sir? -Vikram! Vikram, what are you doing? If anything happens to him, I'm answerable. Mam, he is coolly sitting here and making us run around. Just give me ten minutes. I'll get the truth out of him. Hey! -Vikram, stop it. Control your anger. Damn it. Sir. Did you get the details of the vehicles which passed near Pooja's car? Sir. Praveen is following that list, sir. Ask him to send me the details that he got so far. Sir. What about the bike details? Sir, that sticker matched with twelve service centres. We are enquiring, sir. Find it soon. Okay, sir. Sir! Sorry, mam. It's okay. As a mother, though I'm enraged to kill him... My responsibility is stopping me, Vikram. I fear that my anger might endanger my daughter's life... I'm suppressing my anger, Vikram. Hope you understand. Vikram! My daughter! You can make them all believe that what you write is happening. But I'll not believe it. You must write a new story, now. And that must happen. or else, I'll shoot you here immediately. Write now. Do you think this is like the forceful testimony that you obtain from the witness by threatening? Creative process. I can write only when I feel like writing. It's okay even if it takes a long time. You write when you feel like writing Write now. You must write and it must happen. I want to see it. TN 07 CP 3226 cab came fast and stopped at the police station. The cab driver who got down from the vehicle... ...ran into the police station... ...and complained that three guys have kidnapped a girl. A girl, sir. Four people... I'm a cab driver, sir. They've kidnapped her, sir. J8 Constable Edukondalu is reporting. All the police stations need to be alert. Report immediately if there is any kidnap case, over. I will repeat. All the police stations need to be alert. Report immediately if there is any kidnap case, over. Sir, constable reporting from J2 police station. Got a complaint on a kidnap case. Over...over... I repeat, constable reporting from J2 police station. Got a complaint on a kidnap case. Over...over... Greetings, sir! Where is the cab driver? He left saying that he'll park the car and return. But he went away. Shit! When someone comes to give a complaint that a girl is missing. How can you leave him so carelessly? Idiots. What are you all doing? Okay, how did he look like? He must be 25 to 30 years of age, six feet tall and fair too. Where is the CCTV room? It's in the next room, sir. -Let's go. Check the details of the car immediately. Sit, play the footage of entry of the cab driver. Shit! He had used the jammer. Rewind and play. Pause it. Yes. Mam, this complaint was dated a year ago. Give me. A complaint dated a year ago! Why did he leave it now? Mam, that car was sold a year ago. The one who came here was a cab driver, right? Ask the details about him from that owner. Okay, sir. Mam, check is written in the letter. Read it. My name is Ravi. I'm working as a cab driver. I picked up a girl from the airport today at 11 p.m., Hey, scoundrel! What happened? -Just a minute, mam. Filthy beings! Idiot. What happened, brother? Sorry, mam. they've hit the vehicle... ...and the mirror has been broken. It's ok, leave it. Just a minute, mam. It's them. You rascals, I'll not spare you. Hey, you hit the vehicle and left, don't you sense? Hey, don't shout like a street dog. Take as much money as you want and get lost. Hey, do I look like a dog? -Hey... Leave me. Hey, leave me. Hey, leave me. Hey, who are you all? Four of you are hitting one guy. You guys aren't fit to call yourself men. You sit inside, mam. Don't involve in this. Please listen to me, mam. Listen to me, mam. Go back to the car. Hey, leave him. Mam, you get inside the car. No, Mam. Please go. Hey, leave me. -Hey, leave her. Leave me. Leave her alone. Brother… Hey, leave me. Leave me. Help! Go… Please help. Brother! Mam! Leave me! Hey! The car number... KA02 BC999 KA02 BC999... I want the details of this car immediately. I want to know in whose name the vehicle is registered and where it is, right away. Okay. Sir, the owner has sent a license of the previous driver. Was he the one who came to lodge a complaint? Yes, sir. Show me. Is it him? There is no chance of him being alive. What are you saying? Yes, Vikram. I'm telling you the fact. It has been a year since he died. How do you know that mam? If you're reluctant to say it, Either you must have made a mistake. or else you are trying to escape. Tell me what happened, mam? Mam, let us tell him. Will you just shut up? There is a link between the cab driver, this complaint letter, And your daughter, mam. The car mentioned in this complaint... ...has crossed the place where Pooja's car was stopped. So, something is wrong. You're hiding something from me. If you're not transparent even now, I am not bothered about what happens to your daughter, mam. Mam, already Pooja is in danger. If we don't tell even now, then it'll be our mistake, mam. Sir! One year back, the guy in the photo came to this station with the same complaint. The vehicle number KA 02... This seems to be Karnataka registration. Yes, sir. Do you have the phone and the car key? Why, sir? You're saying that a girl has been kidnapped... ...but you're talking without understanding the seriousness. Give me. Take it. The Inspector told me to get it. Give it. Go and sit there. Why, sir? The Inspector will come and meet you. You go and sit there. When will he come, sir? He'll come in a while. You go and sit there. As it was a kidnapping case of a girl... ...the police suspected him, and he was made... ...to sit in the police station the whole night. The next day morning, the kidnapped girl... ...was rescued from an abandoned place in the surrounding. As she was gang raped, her condition was critical Eventually the issue became a media sensation So, the Government began to pressurize the police department. Has the bleeding stopped? -Yes, mam. Oxygen level? -It's normal, mam. The case was then handed over to Mam who was the commissioner back then. I just got the statement from her. Four names are in the accused list. She has shared all the details regarding what happened to her. Investigation is going on full-fledged. We are trying our best. We need the co-operation of media too. Please don't publish the girl's name or photo anywhere. It's my personal request. Mam, how is her condition now? She has got severe injuries but her condition is stable. With the details revealed by the cab driver, mam was keen to catch them. These scoundrels will keep committing such crimes, no matter what we do. That's why this case has been handed over to you, mam. First, we should somehow catch all four accused. Mam, the cab driver is still in the police station. Shall we ask the cops to let go of him? Mam, a call from a private number. Hello! -Greetings, Commissioner mam! Who is this? You'll know before this deal gets closed. You should do me a favour. -What's that? One among the four people you're searching for is my son Siddharth. His details shouldn't be revealed. Sorry, I can't do that. If you don't do this, Don't think that others won't do it for me. I know how to reward you for this. If you do this favour, you'll be the next DGP of the state. I need some time. Unfortunately, that girl died within a few hours. Oh, dear! Questions were raised by the media regarding the actions of the department. The death of Janani is very unfortunate. Mam, what action are you going to take now? Will arrest the accused soon and bring them before you. They will be prosecuted immediately. And without any further delay, we will get them the right punishment. Mam, reply to us and go. Where is the driver? He is there, sir. Sir! -Is it you? Come -Where, sir? Come...Nothing, I'll tell you. Just come. The cab driver Ravi who was remanded in the police station... ...was taken to the location where crime happened. He was asked to identify the three people who were arrested. Are these the three scoundrels? Yes, these three people, mam. Yes, these three people! -No, mam. Sorry, mam. He is wrong, mam. -Sorry, mam. Sorry, mam. No! No, mam! The complaint letter given by the cab driver was disposed... ...and evidence were created to make it look like he did the crime. Within few hours of the girl's death, they were encountered at the same spot. The news went viral and became a nationwide sensation. A department enquiry was conducted for namesake. We made the cab driver a scapegoat along with three of them. We made everyone believe that he lodged a complaint in the station to save himself. Within two hours of the girl's death… The accused were encountered by the Commissioner… The public heaped praises on Ma'am for her immediate action. I'm not going to justify anything. Any person in my place, would've done the same. The fact that past events are being re-created makes me doubt that someone related to Ravi is doing all this. Mr. Chetan, I want all the case details related to Ravi. Okay, sir. Only then this case will come to an end. You go home and relax yourself. I will handle this case hereafter. Sir, Ravi's case file. Sir! What did he write now? He has written, "The DGP is leaving the police station". Read what he has written finally. "The PA reveals everything about the encounter". Whatever he writes after this, call me and tell immediately. Okay, sir. Okay. Tell me, Praveen. Sir, the BMW car on Bangalore-Chennai highway... ...entered through Poonamalle toll plaza. but is yet to exit any toll, sir. So, there is a possibility the car is still in the city, sir. I have checked the hotels and resorts, sir. there are no hotel room bookings either in the name of Siddharth or his friends. Tell me, Edukondalu. What did he write again? Sir, " Siddharth Devendra is in the city... ...And there are no hotel room bookings or resorts in Siddharth's name." Vikram gets to know this information through Praveen. Damn it. Sir, the BMW car on Bangalore-Chennai highway... ...entered through Poonamalle toll plaza. So, there is the possibility that the car is still in the city, sir. Hey! Hey, Hey, stop! Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Don't worry...don't worry... You're safe. Are you okay? Sir! Pallavi, drop her safely and update me. Sure, sir. -Don't worry. You're safe now, go. -Thank you, sir. I'll take care, sir. Sir, this is the location of the IP address you sent. How many people are inside? Three people, sir. Okay, You be here. and cover for me. I'll take care. -Okay, sir. What, Guru? What happened? Just wait... Let me check. You are not the only one to use a jammer. I use one too. Hey! You're from IIT. I'm IPS. Subramaniam didn't write that I went to the address in Ravi's driving license. Also, he didn't mention where I went from the police station. Because I didn't talk about these two things and you didn't hear about it. As you didn't hear, you didn't tell Subramaniam. He didn't write. You used this to track me and get all the information, right? You've hacked even the car software. You did all these... But after all, you got caught through IP address, brother. Tell me, why did you kidnap Pooja? I got to know about the injustice meted out to my brother after reading that complaint letter. When we traced the details of the car mentioned in the letter, We came to know that Siddharth was the reason for everything. In order to save Siddharth, Commissioner Asha killed my innocent brother in a fake encounter. I approached all the media houses hoping to reveal the truth. But no one came forward to help me. Look here. This is a case that went viral throughout India. Even if what you say is true, we can't do anything about it. Leave all this and get back to your work. On one side, there was Asha, the state DGP... On the other side, there was Siddharth's father who could make the Central Government dance to his tunes. It's not so easy to fight against them. If we want the public to talk about this, This has to become sensational. I understood that only then I can bring out the truth. So, I along with my friends did the groundwork for 6 months and came up with a plan. After following Siddharth, we came to know that his only weakness was drugs. After the three close people to him died in the rape case encounter. He began to travel alone. As the police had already warned him several times, He stayed only at the Park Inn hotel on the outskirts of the city. I asked three of my friends to visit the hotel often... ...and asked them to develop a good rapport with him. As he could not visit Indonesia anymore, the rare drug which was only available there ...was the trap we had fixed for him. According to our plan, we will kidnap Siddharth... ...and also kidnap Pooja in the same car... ...and prove that my brother is innocent. I have designed a dedicated telecommunication setup for this. We can communicate with each other through this. But the writer can only hear the instructions from us through this secret hearing device. He'll be writing according to that. Apart from that, in the DGP's house, the writer's house... ...and the place where we take Pooja after kidnapping her. Pinhole cameras have been installed in all these places. We'll be monitoring from the control room and getting constant updates about everything. Even if the DGP handles the case or if someone else takes up this case. we will be able to keep track of their each and every move. My friends moved closely with Siddharth. They used his weakness and finally kidnapped him. Pooja came to the party hosted by Kishore. Hello! -I voluntarily quarrelled with her -And grabbed everyone's attention. -Hello, can you hear me? Sorry. What sorry? Shall I hit you and apologise then? It seems you're heavily drunk. I'll slap you, if you don't talk with respect. You've come for free booze and you are telling me what to do? I diverted Pooja's car and flattened it after she left the party. To ensure that she doesn't call anyone, my friends got hold of her phone. My friends kidnapped Pooja in the same car that we used to kidnap Siddharth. I also arranged a writer and made him lodge a complaint on the same night. We let Pooja escape and with the call... ...she made it to the control room... ...I used a voice modulator and shared... ...the writer's details on purpose. I'm Pooja... Subramaniam, Sai Nagar. As we predicted, this created media attention. We ensured that whoever handled the case was given a phone with a bug. You got the phone in that process. Whenever the department had doubt on the writer, We diverted it. When you started suspecting him, I re-created my brother's incident and diverted you too. I thought that I could bring out the truth by kidnapping Pooja through Siddharth, That's when you became a part of this operation. or else, I'd have revealed the truth. Shall I tell you what is going to happen? Vikram Kumar encountered Rahul who kidnapped Pooja. Write this too. Welcome, Vikram Kumar! I am really happy and relieved. It feels like my daughter has been reborn. I'm yet to catch the real culprit, mam. Who? The one who lodged a complaint in the police station? But I shot him, and he died long back. Did you kill him? He is in my custody now, mam. What? You killed Ravi. The guy who came to the police station is Rahul. They are twins. Oh, my god! If I had enquired about Ravi's family that day, I wouldn't be facing this problem today. But how did you catch Rahul? When I rescued Pooja... I tracked the IP address through Siddharth's car, and got Rahul's address. But whose corpse did we get near a broken bridge? it's a corpse they brought from the mortuary to divert us mam. Then who is this, Subramaniam? A writer arranged by Rahul. They made us run from pillar to post... ...Kill those three people... ...Make the corpses unrecognizable and throw somewhere, Vikram. Though the trio had planned everything, The mastermind behind them is someone else. Who is the mastermind? I asked you to tell me the truth when we were at the police station. But you didn't tell me. I told you everything, Vikram. If you had told me, I would've caught him immediately. I enquired completely about this case. Only then I got to know that this case has two ends. One is the fake encounter with Ravi. And the other, Janani as a rape victim. How did Janani die, mam? When I was enquiring about this case... I came across something important. What's that? On the day of encounter, a year before... Forty minutes after the news came that the rape victim Janani is out of danger, It was announced that Janani is dead. As soon as you came to know that Janani is out of danger, You came to the hospital... And met the Chief Doctor. What happened there? Who is the reason for her death? Vikram, you wouldn't know how painful the life of a rape victim would be. I have seen many such cases. Their painful journey is unbearable. That's why this is just a mercy killing. It's a lie! It's a beautiful lie that you told the world to save yourself Shall I tell you the truth? If Janani was alive... The truth that Siddharth is a culprit would have been revealed. That's why you killed Janani. You made everyone believe... But one person was sceptical about it. Who is he? Janani's lover, He is an IPS. He is the mastermind of this operation. Where is he now? I'm going to catch him in twenty-four hours. Encounter those three people too along with him, Vikram. If Siddharth is killed, ...it's not beneficial to anyone except you. But if I hand him over alive to his father... If he can make you a DGP... Won't he make me a commissioner? If you do what I say... I will give you ten times more than what you will earn in your entire lifetime as a commissioner. Madam...Madam... Is this scene there in the story that you write? Will you write now? Shall I get you a pen and paper? This is the right punishment for what you did. Sir! Sir! He did all this in anger that his brother had been killed. If you want, kill me, sir. Leave him, sir. True, I can spare him. Sir, he did what I instructed him. It's all my mistake. Kill me, sir. You forbid me to kill him and he forbids me to kill you. This is what we call a, "Father-son relationship". My sons were twins. To run the family, my elder son became a taxi driver which ensured that my other son could study. They unjustly killed such a person. The one who would have taken care of me in my last days... I didn't even get a chance to have a last glimpse of him, sir. Hello! Ravi! where are you? Why aren't you attending the call? Sir, I'm the constable speaking from the police station. Constable? What happened to my son? Nothing, nothing... He is fine. -Then why is he at the station? Just a small enquiry. Will send him home once the enquiry is over. -No problem, right? No problem at all. I expected my son to come back home in the morning. But it was reported differently in the news I didn't believe it I got a call asking me to come immediately. It's been two days since I spoke to my son. Someone else is attending if I call his number. Where is he, sir? What's this, sir? I am asking about my son, But you are giving me his dress. I don't know anything, sir. They told me to give this to you, that's all. Sir, don't stay here for a long time. Leave soon. It's not safe to be here. Sir! My son was innocent and was unjustly killed. I realised that he'll never come back. I don't know why it happened to him. I couldn't even see his corpse... They did all the rituals by themselves, sir. If we can do this... We can bring the truth out in the open. What am I going to accomplish by staying alive in this world? Is there any reason to stay alive? Your target is DGP, right? Then, why did you kidnap Pooja? We wanted the DGP to understand the pain of pain of being separated from her child. That's why we kidnapped Pooja, sir. But he took care of Pooja like his sister, sir. My children lost their mother. They see their mother's image in every woman. I have raised my sons well. Yes, dad! Siddhu, how are you? -I'm safe, dad. Give the phone to Vikram. Just a minute. Vikram, kill those two and bring my son back home safely. I'll give whatever you want and how much ever you want. Okay, sir. He was alone in your custody for seventy-two hours. Then, why didn't you harm him? Our motive is not to kill DGP or Siddharth, sir. Then? I want to let the world know that my brother was innocent. Hello! Mam, watch the news immediately. There's a breaking news about you. The fake encounter by DGP Asha has been exposed. The CM has ordered for an enquiry and arrest. The release of this video has revealed the true facts about the rape case and fake encounter which happened last year. Along with him, encounter those three people also, Vikram. I'll give you ten times more than what you will earn in your entire lifetime as a commissioner The real face of Asha who was celebrated as a powerful woman DGP has been revealed through this video. Tell me, DGP mam. Vikram, you've committed a big mistake. I know how and when to come out of this mess. You cannot walk away from this after doing this to me. I have told you earlier, mam. I have my own law and order. Don't get tensed. I'll send you the location of the mastermind behind this. Go and catch him immediately. Hello! Yes, mam. I have shared a location with you now. Go there and find out who is he and inform me immediately. It's very urgent. -Okay, mam. Hey, both of you leave. You get into the vehicle. Sir! We don't care about what you are going to do to us, Sir. But don't spare him, he raped and killed Janani, Sir. It's not just for sake of my brother. Who will give her the justice she deserves. She had as a family as well, right? Poor girl! She must have pleaded to let her go, right? She would have devastated that no one came to help her, right? I can understand that pain, sir. To prevent incidents like this from happening again... Scoundrels like him should be punished severely, sir. Hey, who are you to punish me? For rich like me... It's very common to enjoy with women like Janani. It's very common for officers like him to save me. Why are you feeling this much for her? Is she your sister or his daughter? Janani was one among the many women I have enjoyed. But she is Janani... Oh, gosh!!! That's ultimate pleasure. Hello! Mam, I'm Vikram Kumar. Mam, I'm unable to reach your PA. I'm just boarding the flight, will reach there shortly. What? -Yes, mam. I received a call from your office. And they asked me to report after two days. Hello...Mam Hello, Are you there? Hello! -Hello Mam. Take care of yourself. Then? Please maintain punctuality. No. Okay...okay... Leave it. What about me? We are going to meet only after six months. I'm going to miss you. Me too... Okay, just a kiss. No... No... -What? Cab driver. Atleast a hug. Just a hug. I'm going. Come on. Come. Come. I love you! Hey! It's okay. Bye. I love you. Love you too. Hey, leave me. How is Janani now, mam? Who are you, sir? Are you from the media? We both planned to get married. But then, this has happened. How is her condition now? She is out of danger now. She needs your moral support to recover. Thank you, Doctor. You told me that she was out of danger. What happened after that? I've come to ask you that But you are avoiding me. I have to know what happened to her right away. See, I shouldn't lie to you as a doctor. and I won't lie... I told you the truth even on that day. After I spoke to you and left... The Chief doctor and the Commissioner discussed for a long time. Then they shifted all of us to another ward. I can say only this as of now. Past is past. We can't change it. We have to move on in our life. Janani and I dreamt of a happy life together. Janani's wish is that you should become an IPS, right? When are you going to join the service? What's the truth... What happened that day... I'll not come without knowing this. I told you as your well-wisher. Then, it's your decision. Asha, what is happening? If you can't protect your daughter, how will you be able to protect the public? Who was the ACP who pointed the gun? Doesn't you have sense? Ensure that news about your daughter doesn't get leaked to the media. Kalyan, I am struck in an emergency situation here. I need an undercover officer. What is the purpose, Mam? This is my personal issue. That's why I am not able to ask help from officers of this state. Hello, Mr. Vikram Kumar! I'm speaking from the DGP's office. Your assignment has been postponed for two days. You can come after two days. I've sent your tickets on WhatsApp, please check once. Yes! Hello, I'm Vikram Kumar. Let me explain. Look at me, dear. Let me explain.
