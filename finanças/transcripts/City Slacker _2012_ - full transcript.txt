-If we buy all the manufactured parts, we're going to have a monopoly. I've been working on this forfour weeks, day and night. My wife has left me over it. But it's been worth it. -Yeah. -I've got Ms. Nolan on the line. -Oh, hi, Ms. Nolan. -Greenstock. All one word. -Quoting. Oh, incidentally, Francis was just-- -Forget about Francis. Get me some detail on Greenstock. -Greenstock. You've got to share price it. -Yeah. I've 34.5 -Got a share price of 34.5. -What are the earnings per share? -2.2. -That gives them a P ratio of 15.5. -15.5. -Dig up everythingyou've got on Greenstock. They're ripe for takeover. I've got another meeting, and I'll be back in the office at 10:00. -Oh, and happy birthday. Happy birthday, she's gone. Sorry about that, Francis. Next quarter, hey? -Right. -Wait here. Good morning, Doctor. He's come around quicker every year. -Ms. Nolan. -My checkups. That's why I'm here, isn't it? -No. Please-- um, Ms. Nolan, please. Oh, look. I'm sorry to do this to you on your birthday, but I've had a call from the fertility clinic about your eggs. -Oh, no. I have got a lot further to gobefore-- that was the point. Eggs frozen at the peak of perfection, ready to use when the time is right. -Apparently, there's been a fire. -A fire? Well, what about my eggs? -All the eggs were destroyed. -Well, I'll freeze some more. I've got loads of time. -Ms. Nolan, look, please. Just look at this graph. See the fertility age. Mid 20s, fairly fertile, lovely. But you are here. So if you're serious about having a baby, well, you're going to have to do it the way nature intended-- pronto. -Good morning, Ms. Nolan. Look what came for you. -Go away. Charles. When you land, don't go back to the office. Come straight to my house. We have to talk before the party starts. -Where is Charles? -He's gone straight to the office. -Just-- can we just go and talk? I had no idea you wanted a-- -No, I've left it too late. -Oh no, I know loads of women who have had babies in their forties. -But Charles can't even be bothered to turn up for my party. How am I going to get-- -Don't give him the choice. And if all else fails, you can always use the fondue fork in the condom. Worked once for me. -Too nice. -All right, darling. -Thank you. -How's my birthday girl? -You're a stuffing ass, butI'm not going to make a scene. -I love you, too. Darling. What? -Get undressed. -What? -Get undressed. -No, look-- I've missedyou, too, you naughty girl, but this is the middle of a party. -We have to make a baby. -What? -I'm ovulating. -No, I thought you-- Ithought you wanted to wait and use those eggs that you gave-- -Well, there was a fire. -Oh, dear. -This is fertility. -Right. -This is age. I'm all the way down here. I have never been at thebottom of a graph in my life. -Don't worry about fertility. Look, you will always be top noogie woogie tottie as far as this chap is concerned. -We don't have much time. -All right. Have you thought about the logistics? -Logistics? -Look, I mean, you're going to need a bigger place, somewhere with a nanny flat. -I don't want a nanny. -What, you're going to look after it yourself? -Oh, don't be ridiculous. I can't give up work. -Yes, but darling, they don't go to boarding school until they're four. -Boarding school? -No, you're surely not thinking that I-- -We don't have to worryabout all of this now, OK? You just relax and take a deep-- No, leave it. -Mr. Yamamoto. Yes, sir. The deal is done. I will call you back, two minutes. -Your heart's not really in this, is it? -Well, it does seem alittle forced with everybody downstairs. -It's nothing to do with that. It's the idea of having children. -Amanda, that is absolute rubbish. -That's what terrifies you. I am on the fertility downslide. I can't waste my time with aman who can't commit to having children, who can't even committo a proper relationship. --Why are you picking on me like this? I haven't done anything wrong. I've been to the office, I've done my work, I've spoken to the Japanese. Now I've come home and I want to have a party. -I want to have a baby! Don't make me laugh. You'd be a horrendous mother. You're far too selfish. For goodness' sake! Ten years, and we still lead separate lives. -It's rubbish. I practically live here. -Oh, a pair of socks, a packetof condoms, and the hockney. That is everything that belongs to you. -What do you want from me? What do you want? -Nothing. -What is that supposed to mean? -It's over, Charles. -No, no, it is not over. -We have to be grown up about this. -You're leaving me. Mummy, matron, nanny, and now you. Think you can just humiliateme in front of all your guests. You think you can humiliate me? Nobody does this to me. Nobody! -Oh, a party. Mandy! -Dad! What are you doing here? -What, I need a reason to see my only daughter? -Only her birthday. -OK, folks. The party's over. -All right. Cheerio. Do you not think you shouldwash some of these dishes, dear? -Stuff the washing. What are you doing here, anyway? -Well, I don't-- I just-- just visiting. -Dad. -I'm in a wee spot of bother. -What kind of bother? -You know that annuity I had? I used it to start a mini cab fund. -You're supposed to be retired. -I had to do something, dear. -How much have you lost? -Everything. -Not the pension? The house? Oh, you stupid, stupid bum pot. -Well, anyway. That's enough about me. So what's happening in your life? -I want a baby. -You? -Why will no one believe me? I want a baby. I really want a baby. My best eggs have been friend. I've just lost the only potential sperm I could get my hands on. I work 70-hour weeks, and I'm another year older. Oh, and thanks for the card. -You mean, you-- you-- aregoing to give up your job? -And end up like Mum? -What do you mean? -Angry and frustrated. The child can sense when someonedoesn't want to be there. -Your mother loved looking after you. -She loved me. Everything else she hated. -What on Earth makes you think that? -Because I was there, unlike you. -Because I was working every hour God gave me to give a decent education. -Oh, save it, Dad. It suited you to have Mum skivvying at home. -But that's what mothers do. They make sacrifices. -Can you not hear yourself? -What? -You just said, "mothers make sacrifices." -All right, parents-- parents make sacrifices. At least you can afford a nanny. -No child of mine will bebrought up by strangers. -So who will bring it up? -I'll find a man. -What man? -A man who'll make all the sacrifices. A man who's intelligent, fit,young, handsome, gentle, good with children-- make thatexcellent with children-- and happy to be a house husband. -Anything else? -Um, I don't think so. -Great. -Is that it? -Yep. -It was the most outrageous moment of my life. I just think there's more to life than grubbing about for money. I'm wanting to settle down, have a family. -That is so refreshingto hear, because frankly, everyone keeps telling me that-- everyone keeps telling me that--that-- -I'll pay for you to rent somewhere. -No, no, I wouldn't hear of it. With the London prices, that's ridiculous. -Well, I was thinking of Glasgow, actually. You've always gone on about your roots, even when Mum begged you to move south. -Actually, there are people there who I would rather not bump into. -What people? -When business goes wrong,they don't call a lawyer. They send someone round with a baseball bat. -A baseball bat? What if they come here? -Oh, no, they won't. No, no, no, they won't. They won't. Well, all right. All right. Listen, I'll go to the Council. They can find me a hostel. A hostel will be fine. -God, you can stay here untilI find you somewhere decent. But there have to be some house rules. -Absolutely. -Ask before you bring your friends back. Number two, make sure thatyou tidy up after you. Three, if you pick up thephone, take a message. And four, don't leave the toilet seat up. -Right. One, um, what was one? Oh, God. Oh, you bum pot. -What do you want? -Who are you? -Who the hell are you? -Well, I'm-- I'm Charles. I used to live here. -Oh, Ch-- oh. Well, thank Christ for that. You can come in and show mehow to make a cup of tea. She's adamant that the father will stay at home and look after the baby. I don't you know you, Charles, but you don't strike me as being the home husband type. -God, no. -I'm with you on that. You see, what she's looking for, you know, is young, fit, manly,slacker to do the business. That's never going to be you, is it, Charles? You all right, Charles? -We've all had this vomiting bug. I've been stuck in the house for a week while Simon plays golf in Dubai. You found your Mr. Right yet? -Not yet. -No, and you're never going to. -Why? -Your demands are just ridiculous. You're looking for Mary Poppins with a clunker. -Yes, well, that's what I gain to take. -Amanda, you have the perfect life. Do you really want to give it all up for this? -Hang on. You told me that having children was the best thing that ever happened to you? -Did I? -The pinnacle of womanhood. Don't you remember? -Oh my god, Amanda. I don't remember anything. I haven't slept for seven years. -Dad? Dad? -Charles, Charles, darling. It's me. I think I made a terrible mistake. Charles? Are you there? Charles? -Yeah, but also-- so when you want to meet? -Well, I was thinking let'smeet up at the weekend. -All right. What about Sunday, meet in the park, about 1:00? -OK. -Yes. -Charles? Hello, Charles, where are you? I've been at the park for ages. -Yeah, sorry about that. But on reflection, I thinkit's better to leave things as they are. -What? -Better all around. -You blonker. Blonker, blonker. Oh, no! -Go in hard, Karim. -You like that, Charlie? -I need a cloth. And another coffee. Actually, a drink. Wine. White wine. A large one. -Here, do you-- do you need a hand? -Yes, thanks. Thank you. -It's just-- well, you're welcome to join me. -Sure, thanks. I'm, um-- that was really silly. I just couldn't get a signal. -That's pretty annoying. -Suddenly, we're in Lilliput. I'd better drink it before it evaporates. Not that I can drink all of this by myself. Would you like to join me? -Oh, no. I'll stick to coffee. Thanks. -What are you usually like-- like-- just things getting on top of me. -Work? -Yeah. -It's Sunday. Go crazy. Take the rest of the day off. -Well, maybe I will. -Hi, Amanda! -Hello. Are you feeling better now? -You drinking? -Yes. My daddy doesn't like it ifmy mummy drinks at lunchtime. -Well, where is your mummy? -With Tom, buying ice creams. -Can't you read? -Sorry? -Oh. -Well? -Well, coffee is not really food, is it? -Trying to be funny? -No? -Buy something from my cafe or go. -I can get my mummy tobuy you an ice cream, too. -Uh, that'd be lovely. - She won't mind,. -Well, that's very nice of you. -I'm just trying to helpbecause my mummy says that Auntie Amanda is desperate to find-- -Where is your mummy? Louisa, this is-- uh, I'm sorry. I don't know your name. -She only just picked me up. -You must be very strong. -Are they yours? -Yeah. It's Tansey and Phoebe. -Very nice. Take it out of you, though, don't they? I'm supposed to be looking aftermy sister's this afternoon. -How many has she got? -Three, and another one on the way. -She must love it. Kids, I mean. Not sex. Though, obviously, whowouldn't with the right man? Wow. Three kids, that must take some looking after. Oh, well, I help when I can. Take them to the park. Play with them. -That is so attractive. Not that you're not attractive,obviously you are attract-- but-- this has gone right to my head. -Yeah. -Yeah, um, because just playing with children can be so rewarding. -Play with us, then. -I'm sorry? -There's the playground. -Yes, but I'm not dressed for that. -Come on. -This is such fun. Please, please, stop. -She doesn't usually drink. -Right to the top. -Yeah. She's not-- um-- -Do you think-- um-- does shehave the right shoes for that? Uh, are you stuck? -It's not my bottom? -Uh, what's not your bottom? -That's not why I'm stuck. -OK, OK, OK, there we go. That's it. Oh no, that is your bottom. Are you all right? -Yes. -OK, that's it. -Well, it's very nice to have met you-- -Dan. -Dan. And you've probably seen more than enough of me, so I'm going to go and join my friend and see if she'll whack meover the head with a shovel. -Are you always this entertaining? -I'm not actually allowedout in public places. -If you ever escape again and fancy a drink, or maybe a coffee would be-- -Thanks. -Although, the phone got nixed-- -OK, OK. -No, hang on. I've got a pen. I'll take yours. -And this is my office. -Email? -Email. -Facebook? -That's for younger kids. -Address? See you. And what about your shoes? -Oh yeah, shoes. Thanks very much. That was him. One in a million. Mary Poppins with a plonker. -Oh, my friend Jaunty went to Thailand. -Shut up, Simon. How bad was it? -I'm sure nobody noticed. -Look, I've found Auntie Amanda on YouTube. -Oh, at least you can't really see her face. What are you doing there? -Oh, it's just Amanda's bra and knickers are very well coordinated. -Hi, Dan. Hi, Dan. Hi, Dan. Hello? -So there's a rumor that you'relining up a major target. OK -Charles? - Let me know,. -Have you lost your mind? -Oh, just joshing about. We can still do that, can't we? -I am going to hang up now. -I'll take that as a yes, then. -I am going to hang up. -Go on, you can tell me. -Goodbye. -She's quite some girl, isn't she? So does she trust you? -Well, yeah, she's trying to play it cool, but-- -I knew you were the guy to do this, Dan. -The kid thing really worked on her. Eyes light up every time I mentioned it. You don't think she'll try and jump me, do you? -No, no. No, she's barren. She's got no eggs, poor old thing. She left me when I suggestedthat I use a surrogate mother. -Right. -So look, she just-- she just wants an unthreatening companion. So string her along. Find out exactly when she intends to move on Greenstock, and then-- -And then? -Well, then dump herpainfully from a great height. You're my kind of guy, Dan. You are perfect for that move up to-- -Sydney? -Sydney. -Thanks. -Hi, Amanda. You're home. -What's this? -Well, you said to take a message. I took a message of what you said. -How is that a message? -What? It says on it, he called, Don. -You sure it wasn't Dan? -You have me there. It's possible there was a penalty appeal. The boy got a bit vocal. -Excuse me, could you takeyour feet off my table, please? -Oh, sorry, love. It's me knees. I have to keep them straight when I'm sitting down. -I told him to use a cushion. I apologize, Mandy, he's got no manners. Oh, you waster. -So many of these things, darling, that-- -Hello? Hello, hello? Ah, hello. No, no. She's just on the loo. Sure. No, you can hang on. Mind you, i-i-if she's having a-a-a-- well, it might be a wee while, you know? Yeah. No. No, it was just a pee. Here-- here-- here she is. -Hello? Dan. No, no, I was in the garden cutting roses. Oh, he's got Alzheimer's. I really think it's time hewent in to secure accommodation. Tonight? What? -It's a bit formal. -Might buy shares off you, butI wouldn't buy you a drink. -What do they know? They're old men. You look lovely. -It's too much, isn't it? -Beautiful. Now he'll want what he won't get without him thinking everyone's had it already. -We go through their dealingswith a fine toothbrush. No, I meant toothbrush, that kind of goes into all those dark crevices. If Greenstock's MD have everput so much as a library fine through the company accounts,I want to know about it, OK? Sorry. -What exactly do you do? -I look for undervalued companies and set them up for takeover. -Sounds pretty high-powered. -You? -Oh, yeah, this and that. I did a lot of traveling after my degree, kind of got in the habit of casual work. Gap year is sort ofturning into a gap decade. -So, how did it go theother day at your sister's? You went to look after her kids. -Oh, fine, yeah. Loads of fun. Lovely kids, actually. -God, I really couldn't imagine coping being at home with three kids. -Really? I think I'd love it. I worked as a nanny for awhile in Australia. -No. Really? -Yeah. -So you have actually had a job? -Yeah. -Because I was beginning to think you were some kind of beach bum slob jockey. -Here's me. Is it good or bad? Have you got a tissue? I'd offer you a lift home, but I'm not sure that the crossbar is that comfortable. -No. -I've had a lovely-- -Me too. -What are you doing tomorrow? -Sorry, I don't mean to be pushy. -No, I'm-- I-- I have to work on this deal, but I would like to see you again at some point in the future. -Shit, sorry. Are you OK? -Yeah. -Well, 'night. -Goodnight. -You called him what? -Slob jockey. -What does that even mean? -I have no idea. I'm fertile again in 10 days, and I just was so worried about scaringhim off by pushing too hard. But I made a complete fool of myself. Again. -Cocoa, anyone? -Listen, darling, you're a man. -Well, I was the last time I looked. -Amanda's ovulating in 10 days, so would that be too soon for you? -I-- I don't really, um-- so,what exactly are you asking me? -Would that kind of schedule scare you off? -Me? -If you were Dan? -Oh, if I was Dan. Oh, thank goodness. God. I thought-- -Well? -Well, speaking personally,Amanda, I would, um-- yeah, I'd jump at the opportunity. -If you were Dan. -He's a very lucky young man. -Oh, we're not going to get anything meaningful out of you, are we? -Sorry, no. -Do you have to tell him? -I don't know. He is so perfect. I can't think straight. -You know, it strikes me thatromance is a free market. You have to stop second guessing his position and leverage what's best for you. Let him worry about his margins. See? Not such an idiot after all. -Oh. -Hello? Amanda. -God, this was a good idea. What? -Yeah, I just don'tpicture you in your glass tower, Mistress of the Universe. -Oh, hardly. -That way if the deal comes off, then-- -Oh, well if the deal comes off,then partnership, huge bonus, and maybe some time todo whatever I want to do. -So, uh-- so when will it be-- be finalized? I mean, will they, you know, give you the day off or something? -What would a mistress of theuniverse do with a day off? -Uh, spend a bit of timewith, with a mere mortal? -Hope he's hungry. -Yeah. -Why do women only admit tohunger after they've eaten? -Years of denial. -Yeah, well that'swrong, because you listen to what your body is telling you. -Are you still talking about food, here? -No, I don't know, talking cobblers. -Do you usually have this problem? -Well, only when I'm withsomeone who I-- well, there you go. Just nearly talked cobblers all over again. -Ah, so women deny hunger,but men deny feelings. -Do you reckon? -I'm famished. -I love being with you. -I suppose at this point I would invite you back. -But-- -But I have to work tomorrow. -Tomorrow's Saturday. -And I have my dad staying with me. -Well, you could always come back to-- oh, no. No, my place is a-- is a tip. -Really? -Yeah, it's awful. -If you were living with someone, Dan, you would tell me, wouldn't you? -What, a woman? Oh, no, no. There's just men. -Men? -Yeah, more mates. Yeah, they come around allthe time to smoke and drink and just-- -Well, I have 48 hours to finalize this deal. Is that enough time to tidy up? -Yeah. Danny boy, how are things? -Yeah, it was fine. Got any juice for me? -Yeah, they're making a move on Monday. Are you sure? -Yeah. Just, um-- what's this going to, you know-- Don't worry, Dan. It's just you and me. -Yeah, but-- I mean, how'sit going to affect Amanda? I'm goingsailing with the CEO tomorrow. I'll have a chat with him about your new package. And end things with Amanda. Make it as unpleasant as you can. -You're a beautiful woman, you know. -Thank you. -God, you're just like your mum. You've got her looks and her brain. -And your knees. -So, when am I going to meet him? -You're not. -Dear, I am your father, you know. -I'm a big girl now. You've scared enough of my boyfriends away. -Who, what? Who, what? -Jimmy Banes. -Jimmy Banes. Last thing I heard about Jimmy Banes, he was living with eight catsand a bald man in Didsbury. What's this one like? -He's-- he's the one you told me didn't exist. He's young, he's clever,he really likes children, and he seems happy enough to just drift along. -Right over to the edge of the cliff. Have you told him your plan yet? -It was only our second date. I didn't want to freak him out. -Oh, jeez. -What? -I just-- I don't want to see you get hurt. -You can be so undermining. -But you just met the man? Even if he agrees to yourplan, how can you possibly know that he's the right personto father your child? -Well, I still reckon I've gota better chance than Mum had. -Oh, now just a second, young lady. -Oh, for goodness' sake. The minute she married you, any chance she had of living a fulfilled lifewent way out of the window. Dad! That is not going to happen to me! Dad! -I will not spend anothersecond in this ice house. -Dad. -You should be looking after me in my old age, not sending me out into the street. -I am not slinging you out into the street! Dad! Shoot. Don't believe that nice ladyin HR because size does matter, and this deal is about as big as it gets. So what I want from you is-- Hello? Oh, Freddie, it's you. Are you with your team? -Yeah. -Might want to share this. The equity committee is veryimpressed with your ideas on Greenstock. -Great. -You don't sound very pleased. -I am, of course. -Well, you should be. You pull this off, we'll haveto make you a senior partner with commensurate bonuses for the entire team. -OK, target, lawyers, board. -Everyone. -Everyone. -Dangers. -Dangers. -OK, are there any risks we haven't covered? -There's a little rumor going around that you might want to check out Greenstock. Just a thought, hmm? -There is this. -Well, that's more like it. What's the area like? Dodgy? -Oh, no. No, it's-- yeah, it's dodgy. -All right. I'll take it. Six months do you? -Here you go, keep the change. -Welcome to the neighborhood. -What the hell am I doing? Charles. Danny boy. You're going to Hong Kong tomorrow. -What? -Danny boy! Oh, Danny boy,the pipes-- hey, hop aboard. No, no, not like that. Get your ruddy shoes off. Christ, man. So, what do you think? -Very nice. -Share options. Cunning bugger timed it to perfection. Come on board, come on board. Ah, park your ass. Right, so this informationyou gave me about Greenstock. It's presented an opportunity. Now, I want you to go andrun the show in Hong Kong. -But-- -All the information you need is in here. Thank you. -But what about Amanda? -Oh, yeah. How did she take it? -Take what? -You know, when you-- when you dumped her? -Oh, yeah. Badly. Very badly. Tears, it was awful. Awful for her, not for me. Obviously, I couldn't givea hoot's water for-- ducks. But back to this Hong Kong thing. -Yeah, Danny. Why do you want to go to Australia? -I like surfing. -All right, so do this and you can surf for the rest of your life. -Yeah, but that's-- -Yeah, but you really have no alternative. At least you're in theclub, and it is how it is. -Yeah, but this is-- -Danny. Dan, Dan. I like you. I really do. That's a compliment, because I don't like anybody. -So at the close of business share price, we proceed as planned with a share plus cash deal of two for seven. Now that gives them a premium of 47%, and that should keep their board on side. It's not a bad little pension, either. Where are you? -Still at work. Are you mad? Get that egg to Dan while it's still fresh. -Louisa, I need some advice. Do it as often as you can, and make sure you tilt your passage. Give everything a downhill run. You don't want to waste a drop. Emotional advice. -Right. I've been with Charles for ten years. It's terrifying. -Darling, darling. He's young. He's gorgeous. Clearly, he likes you. -But does he like me like that? -He's a man. Keep him awake, push all the right buttons, and hold on tight. -Well, gentlemen. I think you can take it from here. -But we haven't finished the subsidiaries yet. -Jonathan, have you got a problem with the responsibility? Nail this thing. -Just finish the subsidiaries. -Well, hang on, guys. This is important. -You heard her, nail it. -Hello? -Dan, it's all gone alot better than expected, so I should be with you in about half an hour. -Oh, great. Half an hour. -See you then. -Cobblers. - No, no, you can't me, mate. -Sorry? -This is no time for pride. My son got dumped by UPS last week. Good luck to you, mate. -Oh, no. No. Oh, no. -Hi. -Hi, hi. -I met your neighbors, and theysaid you often share a drink. -Did they? Go on in. -Anyone would think you didn't live here. Here's the champagne. -Wow. Worked as a waiter for awhile. -Two jobs? -Which is why I don't get to drink it very often. -Here's to-- -Us. -What's wrong? -Nothing, um. I have to-- I have to go away till Monday. It's a stag do-- turn up at the airport, get handed the tickets, sort of a mad-- -So what are you worried about? -Because I'd rather spendthe weekend with you. It's just I feel that I've gotthis one chance to get to know you, and that's what I really want to do, and there's so much other stuff and it's all just getting in the way. And-- -That's exactly how I feel. -Amanda, there's something I need to tell you. -Well, carry on talking. I don't mind. -The thing is, I'm notvery good at multitasking. I never really got bondage before. Anything else you want to try? What have you got in mind? Amanda. I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, yes you do. What's going on? -I've got to go. -Oh, come here. -No, please. -One kiss, and I'll make you some coffee. -I have got to go. -OK, then. What's stopping you? -Oh, I'm so weak. -OK, up you get. -Already am. -Have you booked a cab? -Yeah. -Packed? -Oh, shoot. -Oh, go and have a shower. -What time is it? 5:00. -Are you going to have coffee? Or-- -Blimey. I'll take that. Oh, no. -No. Shoes. -Oy! Don't I know you now, love? Where I come from, that one's 50 pence. Nah, you're right. Go on. -How's the flatshare? -Oh, it's really lovely. It's very cozy. -Really? -No. No, it's bloody awful, as a matter of fact. Still, makes me sad. It's my own stupid fault, so I can't complain. So, things are going well this chap you met? -Is it that obvious? -No, no, but if they weren't going well, you'd have been too proud to get in touch. -I'm trying really hard here. -I'm your dad. You shouldn't have to try. Hey, listen. For what it's worth, I'mreally glad you're happy. -I am. I'm really happy. I have never felt like this. -That's great. Well, you hang onto it, because god, such a precious thing can be taken away from you at any moment. -Whatever I said, I know she loved you very much. -Oh, it's just the office. It can wait. -Really? -Have you got anything on this afternoon? -This afternoon-- uh, a-- no. No, no. -Hey. Have you seen the view? -Corner shop, pub, and bookies. -Do you like it? -Yeah, well-- it'd be, beperfect for--for something. It, it, yes. -Well, that's lucky, then. -Aw. -Somebody in Hong Kongtold me that Tower Equity are leveraged up to their asses. So if the tide were to go out, they would be standing around butt naked. -Dad. Dad, that's what it says. -Aha! There she blows! Caramba! Johnny, your boat has come in. Yes! Business speak for the partner Greenstock are going to take. -Thank God. -What's up? -The takeover's stuffed. Where were you yesterday? Huge investors in the Far East,they're betting against us. -Get a grip. -I've started a bloodbath. This whole thing stinks. Those blaggerts atGreenstock, they've set us up. -You saw the reports. There was nothing there. There were no poison pills,there were no fishy options. Nothing. -Look at our starting share price. The city's backing them, not us. -Jonathan. -We're stuffed. We're stuffity stuffed. Stuffing stuffed. -Right. Boardroom now. -All stuffed, we're stuffed. You're stuffed in there,we're all stuffed out here. -Roberts, Roberts, I can't read this. There's nothing. -If anyone starts shouting or crying, I will bite their cobblers off. And if you haven't got any,you better grow them quick. You're going to need them. Yep, hello, Dan? -You sound tense. This isn't a good time. -Really? Well, I-- I want to see you. Look, I've got to go. -OK, well I'll call you. -Dan is me man with his Hong Kong town, and he gettin' in the back of me van, man. Yeah, hop in. -Driver. That is quite a tidy profit. -It's obscene. -And this is your new office. It's how it's supposed to be, isn't it? So your share of the profitsworks out at around 10 million. So you're going to need this. A chum of mine, off shores specialist, waiting for your call. -Dan, I'm not going to be able to make it. -But why? -Christ, I've explained all this. We are going under here. -I know, sorry. -I hope you haven't gone to any trouble? -No, no, it's-- no, it's fine. Tomorrow? -I'll try. -I've got you something. Dan, that is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Yep, I'm downstairs. Why? I'm going to have to go. They brought the meeting forward. I've only got five minutes. -OK, I guess things are pretty frantic up there. -A massive deal has just blown up in my face. -You're not going to lose your job? -My job, my house, my career,everything is on the line here. -Christ. -It's going to take the bestpart of a month to sort out, which is why I really don't have time right now to be doing all this, you know? -This is going to sound reallyweird, but I can help you. -You? -Yeah, I've-- well, I've come into some money. -Christ, Dan, I do not need your money. -Yeah, well, believe me-- there's more than enough for the both of us. -What planet are you on? I spent one night withyou, which is not the best decision I have ever made in my life. -Why? -Because instead of messing around with you, I should have been concentrating on my-- -Messing around? -It's not about the money. It's about my career, which Ihave spent years building up. -And that comes in front of everything. -I have to go. -Now, despite all this volatility and with the share price going up-- -Yeah, we've all been to business school, and we like your brain. -Screw you, Jonathan! -Gentlemen! Christ! We are fighting for our lives here. I've told you this. -Got medicine. God, you don't look well. -That's not what I need to hear. Equity firms, Amanda Nolan, a very interesting figure-- she has a-- -And now, that is that. -That's your company, isn't it? -We've been taken over. -How'd that happen? -You really want to know? The morning before we announced our offer, the Asian market startedbuying shed loads of Greenstock shares, which forced the price up. At the same time, a rumorcirculated that we couldn't finance the deal, whichforced our share price down. -Oh. -And I feel like death. -Ah, but you'll get better. -How do you know? I could be dying. -You won't have to worry about your job. Why did you eat all that sushi, anyway? Stuffing your face. Your hate sushi. -I hate trifle, too. -Well, you had sushi and trifle. Oh, dear god. -Oh. -Oh, oh, oh. -Oh, god, no. -You want me to go back to the chemist's, dear? Mandy? Is it positive? -Yes. -You sure? -See for yourself. -Well, when one door closes, another always opens. -You are going to get another beaker of urine over you in a minute. -At least an attractive prospect. -They can't sack you for being pregnant. -They can sideline me intoa humiliating cul-de-sac until I fall on my sword. -Mandy. -I've seen it happen countless times. Hell, I've even done it to women myself. -Mandy. -What? -Tell them you're having alove affair with chocolate and you're still seeing chips on the side. Have your baby. Take a couple weeks offand then hand over to Dan. That was your original plan, wasn't it? -I haven't been seeing him. -I thought you two were, you know. -We were, but then worktook me over again, and-- -Oh, dear. Well, neither of us are very good at balance, are we? -What am I going to do, Dad? -Well, there are lots of things you can do and lots of things you might regret, but what you want to figureout is what makes you happy. -You look very smart. You're not getting married, are you? You're not getting married. -No, no, no. I don't rush into that kind of thing anymore. I mean, not that we were-- -I'm really sorry, Dan. I have to apologize about my behavior. -Is that what you wanted to say? -Not just that. Sorry. -No, sorry, I just can'tthink straight when you-- when I've-- I've got something important to say to you. -Really? Me too. -You too? OK, so neither of us goes without saying whatever it is we have to say. -Right. -Right. You see, that was what I was afraid of. Every time I try and tellyou the truth, that happens. -What? -That. God, I missed you. -Me too. -I've been meaning to give you something. And you can open it this time. -Dan, it's beautiful. Where did you get it? -Hong Kong. -Hong Kong. I can be clear later. It's a traditional-- well, it's symbolic of the knots between twopeople of love and truth. -Love and truth. Wait here. -With love. -Now, the truth. I'm supposed to be going to Sydney tonight. -Australia? -If you want to understand why, I need to back to when we first met. -Oh god, I have to sit down. -I haven't finished. -I have to tell you my thing now. -OK. -I haven't been entirely honest with you. You see, the thing is-- -But I thought you couldn't have children. -Christ, how old do you think I-- -I wasn't even supposedto fall in love with you. Oh god, this is so messed up. -Where you going? -All right. Yes, you are going to be a single mother. But you're going to keep your job. -So who is going to look after the baby? -Ah, I will. -Aha! What are you saying? -I will look after the baby. -Yeah, but what about this? What about your mates and your flat and your big-- -What does that matter? You said that you didn't want the baby brought up by strangers. -Yeah, but by someone who wants to with love! -That'll be me, then. -Oh, Dad. -Give me the chance todo it properly this time. And this will be our wee secret. Cup of tea? On the court,the key question that everyone is asking at the moment is wheredoes this leave Tower Equity? Well, I have to say I wouldn'tlike to be in their shoes. I think this is going to put them in an extremely uncomfortable and unstable position. -Even if the regulator getsinvolved, the damage is done. We've been screwed big time. -You're staying on, though, aren't you? -As a non-executive. So I'll have some say in who keeps their job. I don't think you'll have any problem. With your experience, drive, and commitment, I don't imagine your opposite number at Greenstock will stand a chance. -Oh, Freddie. Thank you. -You have my full backing. -Excuse me. -Chin up, girl. -Actually-- -Canteen sushi. -Yeah, I'd keep your head down. -Because she's pregnant. That's how I know you lied to me. -You little sneak. You told me you dumped her. -I need to know the truth aboutwhat happened with you two. -She thought she could just walk away. But that is the lesson, Dan. All our actions have consequences. So she can have her sotted baby,but she's going to pay for it. -You are a deeply mucked up person. -Now I feel all the anger andresentment just melting away. -Why? -Come on, Dan. Think about it. It's the classic coup de grace. Pregnant and jilted by her toy-boy lover? I get to ruin her career and her reputation. -You tell anyone she's pregnant and I will tell the regulatorwhat we did in Hong Kong. -Oh really? What, and lose the Sydney offers and the 10 mil? Get me Freddie Ruddick, will you? -I'm not bluffing, Charles. -Dan, my boy, I know youbetter than you know yourself. You may have scruples, but you're not stupid. Freddie, glad I got ahold of you. Listen, I know that Amanda Nolan is favorite to stay on as head of acquisitions. But there's something you might like to know. I'll call you back, sorry. Get me security. -I don't know you, mate. If they let you go, I'm really sorry. -Oh, thank god you're here. He's trying to steal my computer. -It's him. You've got the wrong person. -You won't even notice I'm gone. It'll be like the newscaster--oh god, what's her name-- you know, she gave birth on the studio floor in the commercial break. -Really? -Well, no. Not really. But she was back at her desk in days. -Can you make sure the regulator gets this? -It's not just the baby. -Well, what is it then? -It's a question of credibility. There are rumors that the young man who-- -Yeah, yeah? -That there may have been pillow talk. -I never discussed a thing-- oh, you've already made your mind up, haven't you? I have given my life to this firm. -Amanda, don't make a scene. -I need you to clear your desk. -Is that clear enough for you? -Amanda. -I can just about understandyou not wanting to stick around for the baby, but why didyou have to tell my boss? -I didn't. -Who did then? -Oh good, you're still here. I really wouldn't have missed this. -This is my boss. He's a maniac. And whatever he said about Amanda, it's all lies. Apart from the baby. -Wonderful. -He set the whole thing up. I didn't think before that it would get serious between the two of us. -You work for him? -I tried to tell you. I just about got my headaround you probably leaving me, and then you said you were pregnant. -Somewhere between a Greektragedy and a French farce. -He said you couldn't have children. That's-- that's why the baby was such a shock. -Oh, the baby was a shock. -Amanda, look. It's all out in the open. I've had time to think about it. -After you saw me do that to him, what did you think I was going to do to you? -Please, don't. -We're looking for Daniel Ryan. -Having a lie down with his boss. Ugly maternity wear. We should just have bought a tent. At least we could use it afterwards for all those cheap holidayswe're going to have. -Oh, phone, dear. -Can you get it please, Dad? -Which button is it? -That one. -Hello, yes? Ah, right. Just hold on. It's the prison service. -Who? -Dan, requesting a call. -Well, he can request all he likes, but I'm not talking to him. -Um, could you call back please in a wee while? About six months. Right, thank you. Mandy. -So Dan tries to stopthis Charles bloke, shocks him, lands himself in theshit as well, pleads guilty, does six months. -She won't even talk to him. -He's doing time while her ex is a runner around on the Chairman's yacht? - Oh, that Charles bloke? -Yes. -Do you think anyone will pay a ransom? Looks lovely. Any beers? -Cheers. -So is she going to see Dan when he comes out? -She won't even talk about him. -After all he's been through? -Stubborn. Just stubborn. I think she's still in love with him. -All right, lads. -Two of the beers. -He'll be here any day now. -Special delivery. -You've got a nerve. -No room for you on the yacht, then? -I'm not going to run away. -I thought I made myselfclear at our last meeting. -What, the--? -Yes, well. -Well, I just wanted to saythat if you need anything, I'm out on parole now and I'mhere for you and the baby. -You really are something, Dan. You think you can just tip upwith a big bunch of balloons and stare at my tits and I'mgoing to melt in your arms. -I was in prison for six months. What did you expect? -You were never one for self-restraint. -What can I say, Amanda? They're enormous, and I couldn't help noticing you're still wearing-- -Well, my dad is going to look after the baby, so you are off the hook. -But what about you? Who's going to look after you? -Nobody. I don't need looking after. I'm fine on my own. -No you're not, and neither am I. -Go away. -Look, before we met, I wasjust another selfish egomaniac who couldn't see beyond the next bonus. -A lying, selfish egomaniac. -And you, who had it all and then suddenly, oh, I want a baby. I want a baby, but I don'twant to give up my career. Oh, I know. I'll trap some poor idiot, get myself pregnant, and then he'll do it all. -Well, my career's up the spout now, I think you're off the hook. -You didn't just want a baby. You needed love. -Not from you. -But you're wearing the necklace I got you. -Oh? -Don't cry. Please, I'm sorry. It's just, I've lost everything and I now know that the only thing that matters is you. -The baby. -And the baby, of course. -The baby. -Yeah, you and the baby. -The baby, you idiot, is coming. -Oh, god. Right. I'll take you to the hospital. -No, no, no. It's coming now. -Ray. Ray, call an ambulance. OK, don't push, whatever you do. Guys, clean sheets, towels, anything. -Listen to him and do whatever he says. -OK, that's it. Let's get you in the corner of the bed. OK, sit on the corner and breathe. -The ambulance is coming towards us, dear. -I think we're going tohave to do this on our own. -What? -It's OK, darling. I worked in a hospital for a while. -Did you? -Seen it on the telly. -Right, let's put these under you. That's it. -Dan, Dan, Dan, I'm really frightened. -Don't worry. Don't worry, look at me. -I'm going to die. -We're going to do this, Amanda. I promise you you're going to be fine and the baby is going to be fine. -OK, OK, you're good. It's only my nose. Breathe. Breathe. -Here he is! I can see the head! I can see the head! Oh yes. Oh, that's it. -You've done it. -We've done it. -You all right? -Yeah, I think so. You? -Nobody's going to ask if I'm all right till she's old enough to talk. -Is it a girl? -Yes, it's a girl. -My darling Isabella. -Isabella. That was her mother's name. -Will you please stop crying and get me a cold drink? -Guys, come meet Isabella. -That's your godfather. Hey, he'll be useful during your gap year. President of some South Sea island by then. -If it wasn't for that naughtypirate, you wouldn't be here.
