EVENING CLASSES We'll discuss that example at the end of class. Gentlemen... Page 80. Again? Lesson 12. On this page we find... “observation.” What does observation mean to you? Observation is... seeing what's going on. Well... What about you? Observation is what allows us to discover the nature of certain personalities. Very good. That's one definition. This discovery allows us to spotlight the behavior of each and every individual. Multiple types of behavior, correct? The first example today will be the case of the smoker. First, the businessman. The society lady. She generally doesn't smoke. Her cigarette floats around the room, keeping her index finger active. On the other hand, with the democratic smoker, the thumb intervenes. Note that the other fingers aren't left out. To this third example we'll add this familiar gesture. This common habit can constitute a serious faux pas at an official gathering. Third paragraph: the beginner. You think it's funny? Would you demonstrate the beginner for me? And you? And you? Come now. You're not being observant! One would think you'd smoked your whole life. I asked for the beginner. Watch. It's easy. Practice that at home. A very interesting and special case... is found in paragraph five: the functional cigarette. This is mostly used by intellectuals, artists, and surgeons. It mustn't get in the way. It's just there. They don't worry about it, or ashtrays either. You'll notice that the smoke, as it rises, often gets in the eyes. One eye closes. Is he reflecting? Inventing? Who knows? Sometimes, when half smoked, it's left dangling from the lip. Completely forgotten. It serves no purpose. The brain alone continues to function. The cigarette becomes useless. Okay, you've grasped that. Let's move on. Let's take a look at paragraph eight: the first cigarette of the morning. In theory it's the best one... and the worst. The rest will be more easily enjoyed. The last paragraph - excuse me - leads us quite naturally to the smoker who's given up smoking. Example: “Cigarette, my friend?” “No, thanks. I don't smoke anymore.” Let's move on... to page 80, where we find “sports.” First paragraph: tennis. If you'd follow me. The first challenge for the tennis player is to find his assigned court. A wall is indispensable for warming up beforehand. This sport is played with a racquet and balls. Before serving, check the quality of the ball. If the first ball doesn't clear the net, check the quality of the second ball. The slightest error on the player's part is blamed on the racquet. A few special movements will correct for the errors caused by the equipment. Gentlemen, you've observed a champion's mannerisms. Now let's examine the challenges facing a beginner. Per the rules of the game, his first concern is to find the serving line. One of the difficulties in tennis is the ball-to-racquet contact. Hesitation is a sure sign of the beginner. A lack of reflexes often translates into anger. Upon seeing the court, these shortcomings are forgotten, and he checks his appearance before facing his opponent. Gentlemen, if you'll kindly return to your seats, you'll find on page 88, paragraph two, angling. What does this very relaxing sport mean to you? - Tranquility. - Good. What about you? Relaxation. Not bad. And you? Peace and quiet. And you? Fish. - What? - Fish. Not always. Gentlemen, let's see how it's done. Gentlemen, please. You'll find on page 90 - I repeat, page 90 - in the paragraph regarding the postal service, the practical and physical training of the postman. SCHOOL FOR POSTMEN Gentlemen, on my command. Attention! Mount your cycles. One, two. Prepare for right turn... right! Good. Left turn... left! Very good. You're pedaling at normal speed for a letter. Attention, gentlemen. Telegram! Catch your breath. A vehicle passes you on the right. Good. On the left. Good. Attention, gentlemen. From head-on. To get your feet back on the ground, dismount. Look sharp! Attention! Bicycle to hip, one... two. Bag to belly. Retrieve letter. Extend letter, one, two, three, four. Faster. Bicycle to hip, one... two. Bag to belly. Retrieve letter. Extend letter, one, two, three, four. Sometimes folks offer us a drink. You got some nerve. You never...? Attention! Facial expressions. Step forward, one, two. A postman must rely on more than his legs. Facial expressions are also very important. First example: a postcard. A brochure. Advertising. Expression for a wedding announcement. A birth announcement. A money order. An expression... for a death announcement. Taxes. Prepare for signature: ballpoint pen! With a real ballpoint, there's no need for the “pffutt”! That's only for a pencil. Attention, gentlemen. For form 1910, modified in 1960... ballpoint! I'm lost without a pencil! I can't do it! Step back, one, two. Bicycle, left! Good. Gentlemen, following that demonstration, we have a new sport: horseback riding. Here we'll observe the heading of the next paragraph in action: “How to Hold the Reins of Your Profession.” Let's begin with the horseman. After a few years of training... and now in his final year... he can still have lapses of memory. For the riding master, elegance is of crucial importance. Let's look at his first pupil... the office worker. And now at a trot. The CEO. His general manager. The society lady. She only pursues this sport so she can tell her friend that she rides horses. An impetuous tap with the crop. The riding master sets the example and teaches his pupils that the essential skill for a rider is to control his mount. We'll overlook that poor example. And here's a very special case: Old habits die hard for the motorcyclist. Not everyone heeds the riding master when he asserts that the horse is man's greatest conquest. Such vitality is not always appropriate. More often than not, the horse takes the initiative. The rider rarely achieves complete mastery. To conclude, gentlemen: While on horseback, goodwill is not enough. Let's continue our practical training and examine how to trip over a step. I demonstrated this for you at the beginning of class. Quite unintentionally, I might add. The move. With that example as your guide, please demonstrate. Take your time. Think. Now go ahead. We clearly need to review the facts of the problem. Siegler, to the board. Given that a man's legs measure about three feet in length and that he generally employs a 30-degree angle as he walks, we must calculate the length of his stride. Here it's equal to the tangent, or about two feet. Given also that the distance between Point A and point B, where the foot contacts the step, equals six feet, it's clear that the strides needed to reach the step equal six feet divided by two feet, or three strides. Go ahead. For a 30-degree angle, with a tangent of 60, that means two steps. Six feet, three steps. Six feet and 60. That's not what I asked for. It's easy! You're not paying attention. Now then... we've just studied how one misses a step. Now let's look at how one fails to miss a column. A rather delicate matter, I must say. Watch. Your turn. Charge! Your shoulder... Lousy. Back to the board. Given the average individual's stride - - You're forgetting something. - What? Shoe size. Given that the average individual's shoe size is 9, by dividing stride length by shoe size we can calculate the strides necessary to reach the point of impact with the column. Very good. Now to apply it. Go on. Shoe size? - Nine. Fine. Go on. - Size 10. - Size 10? Go ahead. The belly... What's that? Your turn. Shoe size? - Seven. What about the column? Come now. Make an effort! It's easy! You can see the distance. Watch. Class dismissed. Class is over. Let me have those. For homework, practice everywhere you can. Restored and Digitized by...
