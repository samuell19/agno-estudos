He left this world, but he's with me in my daily life." I agree If you miss someone dearly, while walking, eating and even working, your thoughts are filled with the loved one. They say time is the best medicine But I think those moments you shared remain clear as time passes. Have you also understood your loved one, only after sometime has passed? Here's our next song.
