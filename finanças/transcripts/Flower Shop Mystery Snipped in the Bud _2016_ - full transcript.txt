- So, what do you think? - Maybe I'm just dizzy from the fumes, but... I like it. - I still don't get it. Who snail-mails an anonymous note with a hundred bucks in cash and explicit directions for black roses? - It's pretty clear, Abby. Angry, scorned, vengeful, wants to remain anonymous. - I tried to see if the handwriting matched any of the previous receipts' signatures. Nothing. Nothing matched. - Of course you did. And did you also test the envelope flap for DNA? - I can't, it's self-adhesive. I can't get a saliva swab. - I did not expect an answer. - They're going to Millston College. - Bruce Barnes? - Yeah, none other than Sydney's pre-law professor whom she's terrified of. - Great! We just give her a call and get the gossip. She'll know. This is exciting! - No, no, not exciting. We are not calling Sydney. She's thinking of dropping the course because of this guy! - OK, she can't, we need someone on the inside. - The only thing keeping her in the class is Kenny, her TA. I think she's got a little crush on him. - Speaking of crushes... Morning, Marco! - What's the good word, ladies? Everything coming up roses? - Yes, actually. Black roses. Can I interest you in a dozen of them? - Yeah, I think I'll pass. Looks more like a Goth trend, or maybe someone was really angry. - Angry. - Angry Goth. - I was wondering if you had time today to grab lunch. - Where to, big spender? Your bar? - Well, come on, today's special is three-alarm chili. If you say yes, I'll make it four-alarm chili. Don't tell anyone, though. - I feel very special, but I'm gonna run these roses over to campus, deliver them to Barnes myself. Maybe chat with him about Sydney. - You sure she'd want you to? - It's not a big deal. I'm just gonna gently inquire. - Like a helicopter parent? - More like a small drone. [Laughing] - Alright, well, what about tonight? Dinner instead? - I can't. Having dinner with my dad tonight. - Thanks for asking, right, Marco? Maybe next time. - Bye. - Abby Knight, the little breeze. - Carson Howell. It's been a long time. - Those flowers are for me? Tell me you're not still mad. - For what? How you beat me for law school valedictorian? Or that you dated and dumped half of my friends? Or for winning the Dermabrir trial against me on a technicality, thus allowing a greedy corporation to continue to abuse animals to test their precious cosmetic products? Ugh! - Good, so we're cool. - No! You know what? Injustice infuriates me. - OK. A, you graduated second. Not too shabby. B, I showed every one of your girlfriends a great time, and I would've shown you the same, if you'd ever given me a chance. And C, I won the Dermabrir trial fair and square. Don't blame me if it was one of your last cases. - Carson, you know full well that I did not leave law because of you. And while we're at it, I think it's a conflict of interest for you to teach law here and still be the legal advisor for a company like Dermabrir! - So I heard you're a florist now. How's that going? - Yeah, it's great. I'm visiting the law department now. Professor Barnes. A friend of yours, I assume? - Bruce Barnes and I are anything but friends. I doubt whoever sent him those flowers is, either. - I don't judge, I just fill the orders. - So, I'm heading to the dean's office right now, but will I see you again? - My daughter's more likely. She's pre-law here. So if your paths do cross, try not to be your usual self. - I will be the model of support and inspiration. - I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. - Love you too. - Uh-huh. Honey! You got my text! - I got a text and four angry-faced emojis. - Angry? Those were an excited face! Oh God, they are so teeny! I don't know why I try using emojis. I'll stick to writing "quote-smiley-face-quote". - Mom! Wow... those are morbid. Since when do you personally deliver stuff out of New Chapel? - Come on, what's half an hour to see my daughter? And I'm also doing a little multitasking. I'm dropping these off for Barnes. - Barnes? - It's just a delivery. And then talk shop, lawyer to lawyer. Hmm? Concerned mom to lawyer. - Helicopter mom with black roses. Please don't embarrass me. - Please, honey! When have I ever embarrassed you? Don't answer that. - If he breaks one of his famous black pencils in front of your face to make you feel stupid, don't say I didn't warn you. - I'll be fine. This is harmless. It'll be fun, OK? Dinner next week. - I'll try. - Oh, come on! I'll send you an emoji. Fun mom buying dinner emoji. Bye! Hello... Belinda. I have a delivery for Professor Barnes. - He's in class. He should be back any minute, though. Those are strange. - Some people think they're strangely elegant. Well, if you could just show me his office, I will set them up. It's all part of the service. [Phone ringing] - One second. Law department? Oh yes, I'll bring them right over. It's the corner office. Just don't touch anything. He's very... precise. - OK. Thank you. - Who are you, and what are you doing in my office? - Professor Barnes. - That is the name on the door. - Um, I'm Abby Knight. I'm with Bloomers, the new florist in New Chapel. Uh, these are for you. - What are those... things? - Roses. Theme roses, I guess you could say. - They're ghastly. - Well, they're a gift. Somebody wanted you to have them. - Well, I don't want them. - OK, then. Well, if you have a minute, I wanted to talk to you about my daughter. Sydney Knight. She's in your criminology class. - What about her? - I think she's feeling a little overwhelmed by the class. - You mean by me. - That wasn't exactly said, but-- - If she wants to be a lawyer, she needs to grow a spine. Wait until she goes up against her first tough judge. I'll look like Santa Claus. - I know. [Sharpener sound] I was a lawyer-- [sharpener sound] I was a lawyer for many years. - Abby Knight. You fought Howell in that Dermabrir case last year, didn't you? Put up a heck of a fight, if I remember. - I certainly tried. - And now you're a florist. - It's a long story. - I'm sure it is. Now would you please remove those grotesque flowers? I have papers to grade. - With all due respect, Professor, a lot of work went into those grotesque flowers. By me, in fact. - Like I always say, if you want something done, do it yourself. - Thank you for your time. [Cell phone buzzing] - Well, hello, Abby. - [Hi, Marco.] Sydney was right, the guy's a real tool. He threw all of our hard work in the garbage right in front of me. - [You did your job,] delivered your order and stood up for Sydney, so just do me a favor. Just be a shrinking violet for once, and go back to your flower shop, please. - No, I've gotta get those flowers back, for my own self- respect and for the respect [of florists everywhere.] - Why do I think this is not gonna end well? - Because, my friend, you are a pessimist, [and I am an optimist.] - I'm a realist and you live in Abby World, which, granted, has some lovely neighborhoods, but there are some trouble spots. - See, and I thought all men liked a little trouble every now and then. I'm going back in, Marco. - Listen, Abby, that's... Hello? - Professor Barnes, I really just... I... wanted to talk... [gasping] Yes, it's the faculty on third floor. Please hurry. Security! Don't go in there. I just called the police. - What happened? Who are you? - Abby Knight. I was just delivering roses. - Wait, are you Sydney's mother? - Yes, why? Who are you? - I'm Kenny Lipinski, I'm Sydney's TA. - Kenny. Kenny, right. Look, Kenny, I think it's best if you come back later. - Kenny, what's going on? - I don't know, ask her. [Radio chatter] [sobbing] - Ms. Knight, I understand that you spoke with Carson Howell this morning. What was your relationship with him? - We didn't have a relationship. We knew each other. I hadn't seen him in a year. - What happened last year? - We fought a court case. - Together? - Against each other. I used to be a lawyer. - I see. - Detective Reilly, I was just delivering roses. - You found the body. You were alone at the time. You have a history with the deceased. Me, I'm just asking questions. - Sir, what should I do with these? - What kind of florist are you, anyway? - They're theme roses. - What were they doing in Professor Barnes' trash? - Why don't you ask him? - Ask me what? - Let him through. What were those flowers doing in your trash? - Look at 'em. That's where they belong. Why are you still here? - Because I'm the one who found your pencil jabbed into Professor Howell's neck. That's why. - You should talk. This woman and Professor Howell have had a past. And it's not pretty. - He was no friend of yours. - Sir, where do you think you're going? - Where do you think I'm going? To my office. Look, I'm as shocked by what happened as anyone, but I have a class in 15 minutes and I need my notes. - That's been canceled, Professor. And I have a few questions for you too. - OK, so, can I go, please? - We just need to process your fingerprints. - Seriously? I'm a suspect? - Just standard procedure, Ms. Knight. I suspect you know that already. Don't plan any trips. - What does that ever mean? - Hey, stop. - Sorry. This floor's closed off. - But I'm here to see my husband, Professor Barnes. - How did you even get into the building? They're not supposed to be letting anyone upstairs. - I don't know, I just walked in. Is my husband all right? - Jocelyn! What are you doing here? - Bruce! I came to talk to you. What are the police doing here? What's going on? - Can I talk to my wife alone? - Sure. - Go. [Inaudible] - Well, you know, it's no big deal. Right? You just gently inquire, delicately, and then... murder. - That is not my fault. - I know. Look, did this detective actually call you a suspect? - Not in so many words, but he said not to plan any big trips. What does that even mean? And if I was a murderer, would I even stick around to alert the police? - Abby, he was just doing his job. - Exactly, so you don't have to. - What does that mean? - It means... it means, Abby, that I know you. You're already thinking about how to investigate this. - That is so not true. - Listen, just do me a favor, stay out of it. Get more involved, you're gonna look more suspicious. - More?! - Yes. Sorry, but yes, more suspicious. - I... have to agree with Marco. I think you should keep a low profile. - Sources have confirmed the body was found by a New Chapel florist who was delivering flowers to the law department of Millston College. - Or... you could use the attention to promote Bloomers. - Excuse me. Ms. Knight? - Uh, yes, can I help you? - Yes. My name's Connor McKay, Illinois-Eagle Times. - Oh, I already have a subscription, it's online. Thank you. - No, actually, I'm a reporter. I was hoping I could ask you a few questions. - About what, Mr. McKay? - The murder at Millston College. I... - Oh, you know what? I'm really sorry, I, uh, got no comment right now. - This'll only take a moment. - I appreciate that, I really do. I'm just trying to close up here. - Um, OK, well, if you wouldn't mind taking my card, and if you change your mind, please give me a call. - OK. Thank you. - OK. - You know, if you don't talk to reporters, they'll just write what they want. - Dad, if that reporter wants to talk to anyone, he should start with that awful Professor Barnes. - Why? You think he killed Howell? - Maybe. Apparently there was no love lost between those two. You should've seen Barnes. His old colleague not even cold, and all he wants to do is get to his next class. - See? Good I checked. No oil. I'll add some for ya. - Alright. Thanks. I really have to get to work. Oh. Oh, I get it. You just wanted an excuse for a second up. - Yeah. Not my fault you make the best coffee in town. - Flattery will get you... everywhere. - Ab. About the murder... take some advice from an old cop and don't go playing detective again just yet, OK? - So what should I do? - Enjoy your life! Take care of Sydney, your business, and keep your old man in the loop. - OK, Pops. Thanks. - Ah, look at this old motor! - Are you kidding me? "Knight lost what some speculate was a career-ending court case to Howell. It is reported that their rivalry has gone back as far as law school." God, this guy did his homework. - Did he mention Bloomers? - Nikki, this is serious, and you're thinking about advertising. Wait a minute. No. No, he didn't mention it. Oh, Detective! Are you here to buy your wife some flowers for your anniversary? - We're divorced. Maybe I should buy some of those black roses. - Maybe you should. My friend is innocent. - Ms. Knight, could we speak in private? - It's OK, Detective. Nikki's my best friend. - You should know that there were two sets of fingerprints found on the murder pencil. One of them was yours. - Well, that is simple, Detective. I knocked over a bunch of Barnes' pencils when I was in his office and had to grab them to put them back, so... I'm sorry I didn't mention it. I forgot. - Seems like a rather important thing to forget. - Who else's prints were on the pencil? - Hm. - Professor Barnes'. - Well, maybe there's your man. - Well, they were his pencils. Of course his fingerprints would be on them. - Why am I any more of a suspect than he is? - I didn't say you were. It's a nice place you got here, Ms. Knight. I'll be in touch. - Abby, is this bad? - Well, it would be if I had actually killed someone. - Well, then it's a good thing you didn't. You didn't, right? - Seriously? - So, I got to thinking. With the press and Detective Reilly obviously ganging up on you, I thought: Let's do this. Let's figure this out. - OK, what do you have in mind? - Well, I'd like to start with the suspect list, and then move on to possible motives. Can I get a pen and paper here? Yeah, um... just like that. - First we have Barnes, OK? He had the means, he had the opportunity, and the motive. - But being a jerk isn't motive enough. - Professional rivalry. I checked. Howell has tenure, Barnes doesn't. And Howell basically told me they were enemies. - But why kill someone in your own chair with your own pencil? - Rage, Nikki, jealousy, temporary insanity. It happens all the time. OK, next: law assistant Belinda, and Barnes' wife Jocelyn. Belinda conveniently disappears before the murder; Jocelyn conveniently appears after the murder. And somehow she managed to pass all the guards downstairs, which is weird, but... - All circumstantial, counselor. - Yeah, but Dad, they're both attractive, and with a player like Howell, that could mean something. - We players get such a bad reputation. [All laughing] - Alright, what about this Kenny character, the TA? You said he showed up after the murder too, right? - Yeah, no, he's more of a wrong place wrong time case. Like me, he's on the back burner. I'm interested in the black roses. Is there a link between whoever sent them to Barnes and whoever killed Howell? - Or are they one and the same? - Why send creepy roses to Barnes if you're gonna kill Howell? - Diversionary tactic. Mistaken identity. - Someone wanted to kill Barnes but stabbed Howell? - It happens, Abby. - Looks like you got your work cut out for you, kiddo. Bye-bye! - Bye! - OK, I just have to go back to the refrigerator and get just a little bit more. - I'm sorry I'm late. What's going on? - It's that article in today's newspaper. - What? - Excuse me, I ordered my roses ten minutes ago. - Just... three seconds. - ...main suspects. Said Detective Reilly: "Though we are still "in the gathering stages, we can confirm that Ms. Knight's fingerprints were found on the pencil that killed Carson Howell." And what about that beast Bruce Barnes' prints, huh? - You're the main suspect! The good news? Bloomers, with our address. The place has been like this all morning. - Well, are people at least buying stuff? - Like it's Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Halloween and Christmas all rolled into one, and guess what's the number one order? - Revenge roses. - Bingo, sister. So you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking we create an exclusive line just for bad occasions. Arguments, divorces, breakups, just to say "I hate you". What do you think? - Knock yourself out. - Yes! - I'll be in the back, trying to maintain a shred of my botanical dignity. And trying to stay off America's Most Wanted. [Entrance bell jingling] [clearing throat] - Abby, you've got company. - Well, I don't suppose you're here to bring me good news. - Wow, I get a better greeting from my ex. - Abby's still innocent, by the way. - So, Abby, you're pretty good at this, aren't you? - Being innocent. - I was referring to the flowers. Although I thought you might be a little concerned... about this. It was sent in an anonymous email. - Doesn't look great. - No, it doesn't. In fact, you look quite angry with Carson Howell there. Were you? - Detective, Carson Howell and I had kind of a... twisty history that stretched from law school into our professional lives, and let me tell you, he's not a good man. Not at all. He's a total womanizer. Not to me, but to all of my friends. And yes, I did lose a very important case to him, and yes, I did bring all of that up when I saw him that day, but I had no reason whatsoever to kill the man! Ha, ha, ha! Look at me! Abby Scissorhands, ooh! I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna put that there. - Well, I just thought that you'd like to know that this is out there. - I appreciate that. - OK, you just looked like a crazy person. - I know the evidence is circumstantial, but an argument could be made that I had access, motive and opportunity. - Don't forget that video of you threatening Howell within an inch of his life. - I am glad that you find this so funny. - I'm not saying I find it funny, I... You know what I find funny? What you're doing with these bottles. What are you doing? Is this the alphabet? - No, I'm color-coordinating. It's very calming. - That's great, but this right here is cold. Really cold. - Sorry. I hear that Howell's memorial is tomorrow night. I was thinking that maybe I could... wecould be proactive, you know, suss it out quietly? - You mean like a stakeout? - No, come on, I know not to meddle. I mean, just be my own best advocate, you know, find... clues, facts, suspects, without being seen. OK, yes, a stakeout. - Look, I think it's a great idea, and I'm going with you. - Oh, thank you! Ooh! That's kinda cold. - Ha! Yeah. I'm gonna make sure you're not seen. We don't want this any worse than it already is. - Alright, you're right. I'll just hover around the edges, you know, kind of memorial... adjacent. Alright, keep your phone on in case I need you, OK? - You know that most stakeouts run in pairs, don't you? - Not in Columboor Kojak. Those guys were lone wolves. - Right, I forgot your precious old detectives' shows. I stand corrected. - Mm-hmm. - Don't let anybody see you, OK? No need to be more suspicious than it already is. - You think? Seriously? [Laughing] - Alright, you know who to watch out for? - Yeah, I found all the pictures online. Thank you, Facebook. - Go get 'em, partner. - Be careful, OK? - Bossy. - Alright. - Professor Barnes will now say a few words. - Carson Howell and I spent twelve years together teaching law, and I can honestly say he had a better understanding of what was right and what was just than any man I've ever had the fortune to know. He was a great educator, and quite simply, was one of the finest men that any of us will ever meet in our lifetimes. [Loud honking] Carson Howell will never be forgotten, on campus or off. That was because of his dedication to making Millston College as great as possible. [Texting chime] [cell phone buzzing] It wasn't just the way that he taught, or his charity work. It was a great loss for the school and for everyone who knew Carson. [Texting chime] ...that we may not disappoint him by faltering in our studies and our teaching. We must continue his legacy, realizing the potential that he saw in each of us. [Sniffling] Thank you. - Mmm. [Knocking] Ah! - Hi, Abby. - Are you stalking me? - Do you usually stake out memorial services? - I do. I do. Yep, I do. These things are like a bonanza for new flower trends. [Laughing] - Good answer. Well, if you're not too busy right this second, what do you say I squeeze on in here and we do ourselves a little bit of an impromptu interview? - I don't think so. - Don't you want to defend yourself? - I have nothing to defend. I'm innocent. Everybody knows it. - I don't. - Well, you should. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my st... st... strategic, uh, flower observations. - You can't get rid of me, Ms. Knight. - Doing a pretty good job so far. - I'm not going anywhere. - So, how did you say you knew Professor Howell, Mr. Savare? - You know, I was meaning to ask you: you're an event planner, yes? - Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. - You have got to check out my restaurant. Chicago Bar and Grill in New Chapel. Have you heard of it? - Oh, yeah. - It'd be a great place for your next party. If you're looking for a fun spot, that is. - That sounds good. Could use a little bit of that right now. - Yeah. Here's my number. Why don't you call me and set up a tour? - Sure. - Making new friends, Jocelyn? - Dear. - Marco Savare. It's a pleasure, sir. I just wanted to say... I just wanted to let you know how moved I was by your emotional speech. Looks like you're gonna miss Professor Howell quite a bit, huh? - Yes, there will be a hole around here for certain. - Professor Barnes, I just wanted to say thank you for your beautiful words. - Belinda seems awfully broken up, doesn't she? - That one? She cries at the drop of a hat. A pencil breaks and she starts wailing. - Professor, Mrs. Barnes. - Kenny. Have you met Marco Savare? He's... I'm sorry, how did you know Carson? - Oh, we were, uh... old squash buddies. - Kenny Lipinski. - Marco. Pleasure. - We're all gonna miss Professor Howell very much. He was a great man. One of many great men around here. Anyway, I have to get to class, but it was nice meeting you. - You as well. - I could use a drink. - Yes, absolutely. Of course. After you. [Camera shutter clicking] Nice security, Abby. Did Columbo teach you to keep the doors unlocked too? - I have a lot of things to do! - Like what? Whether you should eat sour cream and onion or BBQ chips? - Well, they were out of salt and vinegar. - Brilliant. - When you were in there, did you happen to meet Walter Pierce? - Who? - Walter Pierce. He owns Dermabrir. Howell represented him in that animal rights trial. - OK... - I just saw Kenny be real friendly with him. - Huh. Well, no, I didn't meet him, but I did meet Kenny. Seemed like a nice kid. - Hm! - But did youget a chance to check out Barnes delivering Howell's eulogy? - What did he say? - Made it sound like they were brothers from another mother. - Oh! Right, so if someone suspects Barnes of killing Howell, they'll have to think twice. Very clever. - Maybe he was taking the high road. - I doubt that. - Drive, I want to tell you-- - Don't tell me what to do. - Can I at least tell you about my charming Jocelyn Barnes? - Yes. - Can I eat your chips? I'm kidding. - OK, Belinda-- why was she so broken up at the memorial? Hmm? Did she do more than assist Howell? - And if so, how many women was Howell juggling? - Well, from his past history, I'd say a lot. - Money or love. Most murders always trace back to someone not getting what they wanted. - Well, do you think that Jocelyn was not getting what she wanted? - I'd say it's a possibility. I mean, she was totally-- - All over you. - Come on, I mean, I'm a pretty interesting guy. I'm just saying the facts! I'm an interesting... She kind of thought I was interesting. [Laughing] What? I'm just-- - Chiseled features. - Thank you, Mr. Knight. - Pay attention, please. We got Kenny. OK. What is his connection to Howell's old employer, Walter Pierce, if any? - And did this Pierce have any reason to want Howell out of the picture? And did Howell know too much about Dermabrir? I did some digging. That company definitely has its ups and downs. - That's very interesting, Dad. Let's add that to the mix. I'm gonna go meet up with Belinda. You make an appointment to talk to the lovely Jocelyn. Behave yourself. - Joce... - Relax. Easy. And maybe Sydney can set up a meeting for me and Kenny, see what he knows. - And I'm gonna work on our line of black roses. I'm telling you, we're gonna be trending. - Yeah, I can see it now: #blackandbloomers. [Chuckling] Tough crowd. - I just feel terrible. - Kenny, are you sure you're OK to talk about this? If it's too soon, I totally understand. - I mean, Professor Howell had just secured me this amazing federal law clerkship and... well, I never got a chance to thank him. But if you're OK, I'm OK. Are you OK? - Well, I would be lying if I didn't say that it's been a bit nerve-wracking, but... we are hanging in there, aren't we? - Definitely, Mom. - Well, if it's any consolation, you have a lot of support here on campus, starting with me. - Thank you. So does anything jump out at you about Howell that could be relevant? - Um... Look, here's the thing. Barnes wasn't the only one who had issues with Howell. - Go on. - Well, um, after he was... killed, word around the law school was that Howell had just split up with a woman, someone who wanted too much from him. But, according to the rumor, whoever it was didn't take it too well. Even made threats about his job. - Do you know a guy by the name of Walter Pierce? - Uh, Pierce, yeah. Yeah, um, he works with Dermabrir. I just met him at the memorial. Why? - Well, Howell did work for him. I was wondering if Pierce was involved somehow. - Not that I know of. Anything's possible, I guess. Do you mind if I ask you a question? - If you wanna take a selfie with a murder suspect, it's already been done. - Uh... - Yeah, that happened. - No, no, it's just... Professor Howell didn't... didn't end your law career, right? - Kenny... - My dad died six months before that trial. My mom was rethinking her entire life at that point. Professor Howell had nothing to do with why she quit law. - I don't think I could've said it better myself. - I'm sorry. I had no idea. You two are pretty amazing, you know that? - We like to think so. - "Please deliver before noon, February 4th". The question is: was Belinda so upset at the memorial because she was the one Howell dumped for wanting too much? - Or was it Jocelyn Barnes? - See, I can see Jocelyn cheating on Barnes, but not necessarily with Howell. Why don't we send you in as bait, see who bites? - Why don't we not do that? - Hm, speaking of Jocelyn, have you set up a time to meet her yet? - Yeah. Yeah, I did. I actually left a voice message, but I haven't heard back. Why? - Something is off, the way she just showed up in the law department on murder day. I've got some questions I want you to ask her. - Alright, I can do that. - You make a mean burger, Savare. You can cook for me anytime. - Really? Is that an invitation for a date? - Slow down. - Well, I hope you left room for dessert. - Always. 14 orders came in overnight, so as soon as we get back from the flower mart, you start with the vases and then I'll just-- [knocking] - Uh, I'll get that. Detective Reilly. - Morning. - Abby? - So, we are making house calls, I see. - I hope you have a warrant. - It's not that kind of visit. - Well, carry on. - I went by the flower shop, but it was closed. - Yeah, 'cause it's 7 a.m. - Well, then yes, a house call. I have a question: who sent the black roses to Bruce Barnes? That's a missing piece that you could provide, but strangely, you haven't. - Not strange at all. It was an anonymous note. - That's a very convenient answer. Perhaps you-- - Hello! Hello! How's my little murder suspect? That was poorly timed. - Well, if it isn't highly decorated Detective Knight! - Detective Reilly, Detective Jeffrey Knight, AKA my father. - Detective, please, don't let me interrupt. Act like I'm not here. - I delivered those roses to Barnes in person. Why would a murderer put themselves right there right then for everybody to see? And don't say access to the victim, it never holds up in court. - Ms. Knight, I'm just asking the questions. It's my job. Well, you understand that, Detective Knight. - 100 %. Let's look at the facts, Detective. Abby gets an anonymous note, delivers flowers, finds a dead body, and hey, we're cops, we're just doing our job. I know you're just filling in the blanks. I'm sure you know it's not Abby. You probably wanna get that anonymous note for your files and rule out Abby. Right? - Yes, that was my next request. - OK, The note is at Bloomers', and I will drop it off at the station by 9. - Great. - Nice job. - Back at ya. Don't you just love a good murder case? - You know, I was thinking that maybe a disgruntled student ordered these flowers for Barnes, and let's be honest, it can't be the only person who thinks he's a bully, right? - Yeah, I thought of that too, but I mean, would a student really blow a hundred bucks on a prank? - Hey! Our roses are not a prank. They're art. - I'm sorry, Nikki. Alright, a hundred bucks, US mail, not a local florist-- it seems too much thought for a student to have done this. - You're pretty impressive, Abby. I have to admit, I like the way you think. Among other things. - Oh, relax, partner. - Abby, I don't want you to worry about Detective Reilly anymore, OK? My guess is he's got nothing. He needs something and he's just trying to rattle your cage. - Well, he can think again. - You tell him, tough guy. What? What is it? You OK? - What if they don't find whoever murdered Howell? Hmm? I mean, what if all this attention on me doesn't just blow over? I have so much to lose. - OK, come here. Come here. Come here. Listen to me. Hey. This is all gonna work out. And I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. - Promise? - I promise. OK, let's get back to work. Alright. We've got a total of six suspects, three on site at the time of the crime, two proximal suspects, and finally, the unknown sender of the black roses. - Hi, Belinda. I'm Abby Knight. - I know who you are. Suspect number one. - I had nothing to do with what happened to Professor Howell. But I would like to talk to you about him, if that's OK. - I'm really busy right now and I have to get to a meeting, so-- - Besides, I'm hardly the only person that the police have their eye on. - Come with me. - Who do you think killed Professor Howell? If you had to take a stab--uh, guess. - I really don't know. I've worked here for ten years and I've never met anybody who didn't like or at least respect Professor Howell. Ex-- Except Professor Barnes, but he doesn't really like anybody, so... - How about somebody he was dating who got possessive, like "If I can't have him, nobody will"? - Look, it's no secret Carson had a revolving door of women, but any specific troublemaker? Not that I know of. - And you and he, nothing? - Me? No! No, he was my boss and my friend. Plus I already have a guy. - Still, this must have been very hard for you. - Like I said, he was my boss and my friend and... it haunts me every minute. I have to go to the admissions office, OK? - OK. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. - Ah! You! - I was just leaving. - You better be, or I'll call security. - Alright, call security. Call Detective Reilly if you want. I would be glad to clue him in on your motive. - Oh, really? And what would that be? - His denying you tenure. You thought it would help if Howell was out of the picture. - You have a very vivid imagination, Ms. Knight. I strongly suggest you drop your snooping and go back to your little flower shop, Ms. Knight. You don't want me as an enemy. - I believe you. Careful, you're leaving a trail. Motive confirmed. - From the looks of it, seems that Mr. Barnes here is your primary suspect. - A lot sure points to it. Maybe too much. - Either way, the guy sounds like a total horror show. But... OK, Abby, attractive woman to equally attractive woman, do you really believe Belinda never had a thing for Howell? - I was able to resist his charms; there's no reason she couldn't. But I was thinking the same thing, that's why I'm not letting her off the hook so fast. Dad, do the honors. - I see your Jocelyn Barnes column is a little light. What's with her? - Ask Marco. He's on Jocelyn watch. - As a matter of fact she's coming by the bar tonight, so, news at 11. - Don't forget to ask her about Barnes' tenure. And, uh, why don't you check out her fidelity quotient? - How do you propose he does that? - Not to worry, Mr. Knight. I have a few tricks up my sleeve. - Give the man a little space. - Learned some things when I was in the army, let me tell ya. - Oh, my goodness. [Indistinct words] [laughing] - Oh, um, it seats 170, but I can also close a couple of these rooms if you're looking for something a little more intimate. - Oh, that's great. Marco, thanks for the tour. I am sure that I can bring you some business. - Really? Fantastic. I love to hear that. I'm always looking for a good recommendation. Listen, I got a great idea. Let me make you a drink. - Oh... - Just one. Come on! You're in my place, let me make you a drink. - Oh, why not? - I make a world-famous vodka martini, I'm telling ya. - It's been a crazy week. One cocktail won't hurt. - It'll definitely help. Come on. So listen, I have to ask: what is the life like for a law professor's wife? - Well, I can't speak for other wives, but mine... mine has its special challenges. - Really? Well, so, this is my world-famous three-olive vodka martini. Four olives, people get in trouble. [Laughing] Enjoy. - I will. Mmm! Mmm... - Huh? Right? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Challenges, though, huh? Man, that's gotta be tough on you. - Sounds like you two had a fun night. - Well, any one of my martinis will get you talking, so... Speaking of talking, all she kept talking about was how hard it is to be married to Barnes and what a tough and crabby guy he is. Wait. Am I... detecting a little sort of jealousy here? - No! I'm just looking out for you. - Oh. Um, where was I? Oh, yeah. She did confirm there was a rivalry between Barnes and Howell. See, Barnes was jealous that Howell had all this popularity, especially within the administration. - What about the tenure issue? - Major sore subject. Wait a second. Can I get you a martini? - Absolutely not. Continue. - Um, Barnes was furious that Howell wouldn't grant him his tenure. But, no surprise here, whoever the new committee chair was gonna be, Barnes was hoping he would reconsider his bid. - Well, did she say who she thought might have killed Howell? Like for example her tenure- deprived maniac husband? - No, she was actually protective of Barnes, yet also protective of Howell. You know what was really weird? Is by the time she had her second martini, she was implying a certain level of fondness for the late professor. - There's a shocker. [Scoffing] What if Jocelyn and Howell were an item, but she got clingy so he dumped her, and then she came that day to try to talk him out of it, but couldn't, and then took revenge with one of her husband's prized pencils? - Come on, Abby, it's a bit of a stretch. I don't know. I mean, benefit of doubt here, I think Jocelyn is a pretty decent person. - Well, even decent people can lose it, Marco. - I agree. Oh, I forgot to mention this. I couldn't steer Jocelyn into telling me how she showed up at the law department that day. But I will next time, don't worry. - Next time? - You know, I have to admit, I'm really digging this whole jealousy thing. - Come on, I'm... [laughing] No. I'm really just looking out for you. Can I have that martini now, please? - Three or four olives? - Five. - Whoa. - Thought you'd given up. - You haven't given up on your investigation. Why should I give up on mine? - Good point. - Does that mean you're ready to talk? - Not really, no. - Oh, come on. You know you want to tell me about all that new cool stuff that you found out recently with your friend... what's his name again? Marco Salvare? I'm a reporter. It's what we do. - No, thanks. And I know if I don't talk to you, you're not responsible for what you write, but you know what? You're totally responsible for what you write. And for who you mislead. And who you hurt. And on that, you can quote me. - Have a great day, Ms. Knight. - How'd you do? B plus?! Sydney, you killed it! B plus from Barnes is like an A plus from regular professors. I hope I didn't say that too loud, but... but it's true! - I studied like crazy for that test, but honestly, I thought he was gonna give me a bad mark just because. - Just because why? - Because my mom has it out for him. Or vice-versa, I don't know. - Yeah, well, your mom's in a pretty tough spot. She's gotta do what she's gotta do. [Sighing] - So, what's your best guess on who killed Howell? - I'm still leaning towards the scorned woman theory, but who knows? You know what I will tell you, though? You know who's really flying under the radar right now? It's Belinda Harper. - From the office? - Yeah. - Why do you think? - Well, I mean, I just saw the way that she was around Howell. She was totally into that guy. I don't know if anything ever happened between the two of them, but... if it did... I'm just saying. - Dad? What are you doing here? Is that my paper? - Yeah. I thought you might need some company while you read it. Here, drink this first. - Is it bad? Oh, of course it's bad. It's 8 o'clock in the morning and you're here with tea and sympathy. - It's a $9 tea drink for Andy. - Ooh! Good. Very good. Now let me see the paper. [Gasping] What? My driver's license photo? - It gets better. Meaning worse. - "Ms. Knight has repeatedly refused interviews. "Local observers seem eager to talk about her. "'If she's got nothing to hide, why not talk to the press? Makes you wonder, doesn't it?' "Said one longtime New Chapel resident who requested anonymity." And the photo... It already looks like a mug shot. - Monkey, maybe you should sit down with this reporter. You know, back in the day, I knew how to work the press in my favor. You can do it. - Oh, Dad, right now I just need to get to work. Thank you for the tea. - At the very least, get a new driver's license photo. [Laughing] - That's for sure. - What happened to your hair? [Laughing] - What are you talking about? It's bold. I personally... love bold. [Laughing] - Guys, come on! Can we please focus? [Sighing] - OK, I'll do it. Listen, Nikki and I were talking earlier and we both think that you should get yourself a lawyer. - I'm sure Dave King would be happy to take your case. - Hire a lawyer? I am a lawyer. A good one. If I lawyer up now, I look 100 % guilty. No way. - Abby, we're just looking out for you. - I know! I know! But the instinct was right! I'm a good lawyer, but Reilly hasn't witnessed that yet, so I'm gonna go visit him pro se, which is Latin for myself, and set him straight using facts, using logic, convincing him beyond a reasonable doubt that I am innocent! But this goes away. In addition to a strained work relationship in regards to jealousy about tenure, Bruce Barnes had the most obvious reason to murder Howell. However, I would not discount rumors, even though they are pure conjecture and inadmissible in court. A jilted lover may have actually killed him, leaving the names Belinda Harper and the aforementioned Jocelyn Barnes. So, in summation, there are at least five suspects with a motive. Abby Knight clearly did not have the deliberation, the intent, nor the premeditation to be a suspect. And with that, Detective Reilly, I rest my case. - That still doesn't change the fact that your fingerprints were on the murder weapon. - That's it? That's your investigation? - Fingerprints can be such a nuisance. Especially when they're yours. - In a very rare moment of klutziness, I knocked over Barnes' pencils. Had the courtesy to clean after myself, and that is why my fingerprints are all over those pencils. - So your lack of dexterity is your alibi? - My grace precedes me. Are we done here? - I believe so. - That was an accident. - Ann, can I get a fresh cup of coffee and some baking soda and some vinegar and a couple of aspirin? And a rag. - Ever heard of the phrase 'he who represents himself has a fool for a client'? - Let me guess. It didn't go over so well. - I talked to Reilly. He will not get off the fingerprints. - Well, maybe you gotta put your investigation on hold for now. - What? No! That's the whole point! Clearly, I can't count on the law. It is me, myself and I, and hopefully you. - Give it a week, Abby. What's it gonna hurt? Focus on your shop, focus on Sydney, your dad-- focus on me if you want. Let the truth come out the way it's supposed to. - I don't get it, Marco. What is this, a control thing? You're trying to teach me a lesson? - Abby, whatever happened to "I have so much to lose"? - I do, even more so now, but when I said that, I didn't think it would include you. - OK, fine. I will support anything you do. I will. But I'm worried about you, OK? And I think you need to take a break. I told you I'd make sure nothing happens to you, and I'm gonna keep that promise the best way I know how. Right. - Focus remains on New Chapel resident Abby Knight for the murder of law professor Carson Howell. Knight, a former Chicago lawyer, is the owner of a Main Street flower shop called Boomers. - It's not Boomers, it's Bloomers! - Is this ever going to end? - Knight had a history of conflict with former law professor Howell. - You! You have no conscience! I don't even understand how you live with yourself! - Abby, come on, keep it in the courtroom. We feel vindicated. - Oh, I'm sure you do! - Dermabrir's exceeded all the regulations. - You're an animal! Oh! - A career-damaging courtroom lost to Howell, plus fingerprints found on the murder weapon has kept Knight under the microscope. Knight, who continues to run Boomers-- - Seriously, again? - Whoa, easy with the scissors! - However, with no other suspects, charges are soon to follow. - Well, I have a public comment. It's Bloomers! - You know what, Nik? I think it's time I go public as well. If Marco calls, tell him I... went to the dentist. - Are you sure? - I am so sure. - Hey, remind him that it's Bloomers, not... Boomers. - Let me just say I'm glad you decided to go on the record. I really think this is gonna help your cause. - I am ready to begin when you are, Mr. McKay. - OK, Ms. Knight. Let's start at the beginning. The morning of the murder, what brought you to Millston College? - I was doing a flower delivery. To Professor Barnes. - OK... - Boy, you really covered your bases here. Good work, kiddo. Reads like expert testimony. And nice photo. [Chuckling] - Thanks, Dad. I just told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. - Well, I thought it was totally bold of you. Great job. - Thanks. Well, hopefully now everybody can just draw their own conclusions. [Entrance bell jingling] - Hmm. - This'll be good. - "When I touched the pencil, it was a pencil, not a murder weapon". So much for taking a break, right, Abby? - Have you ever heard the phrase 'the truth will set you free'? - Yeah, have you ever heard of the phrase 'the lady doth protest too much'? - Yes, and it usually doth come from a man. - Oh, she's got us there, Marco. - OK, alright, fine. Let's just hope Detective Reilly appreciates it, because Barnes, that's a whole other story, let me tell ya. - Well, technically she hasn't said anything about Bruce Barnes, or anyone else for that matter, that's not already out there. - Thanks, Dad. I feel good. I feel like I'm in control. - I'm glad you do, because there are some things in here-- - Delivery for Abby Knight? - That's me. [Giggling] - Oh my gosh, Abby! Who sent you those? And why didn't they order them from us? - "So kind of you to speak out. Thanks for nothing. Bruce Barnes". - Hm! Guess Barnes really didn't like that article after all, did he? - Well, he can do his own interview. [Television playing] No, thanks, I don't wanna... - I do this whenever I get stressed and then I hate myself. - Oh... gimme a bite. - We will return to our murder mystery marathon right after this message. - I don't know, Dad. Do I keep trying to solve the mystery that's threatening my entire existence, or do I listen to Marco, step away and do the system do its job? - You're asking someone who worked for the system for 40 years. When it works, there's nothing like it. When it doesn't... - There's nothing like it. - Uh-huh. Listen to me. Take a breather. Not to make Marco or me or anyone else happy, but to give yourself a break. I think you need it. - What do you think Mom would say if she was here? [Chuckling] - Your mother? She'd say: "Have faith, pussycat. "And please, please, please, tell Dad to step away from the ice cream." [Laughing] - Dad... - Fine. For Mom. [TV show resumes] - What's this? Is Madam Columbo closing up shop? - No, I'm just taking a little bit of a hiatus. And no, I'm not caving to the pressure, I just realized I was neglecting my store, my family, my best friend. - And you're OK with Detective Reilly running the show? - No, but my sleuthing netted some great intel, so I figure I bought myself a little life insurance policy. - Which hopefully you won't need to cash in. - Nik, that's beautiful! See, you are way too talented to spend time on revenge roses. - Thanks, but I think I'm really good at those too. I was so jealous when I saw these black roses from the other florist. Which is why, if you're OK with it, I wanna do a revenge roses marketing blitz. Up our social media presence, help put Bloomers on the map. - What, as something other than the home of the law school killer? [Phone ringing] Go for it. Knock yourself out. Just remember to keep the happy flowers a priority. [Phone ringing] I will be forever creeped out when I see a black rose. Or a black pencil, for that matter. - Hi, Bloomers. Uh, yeah. Oh, of course! Yes, we can do that, no problem. Um, I can check. - Can't believe Barnes sent you black roses. Could he actually have a sense of humor? - More like a childish temper. - Mom, you stood up for yourself, just like you always told me to do. If Barnes wants to defend himself, he can do his own interview. - Yeah, that's right. - By the way, Kenny said that he thought your article was great and really smart of you to do. I think he was secretly happy that it made Barnes squirm a little. - So he's not a big Barnes fan either? - Hardly. Barnes doesn't let Kenny do anything. Won't let him help with lesson planning, won't let him help with the grades, nothing. Kenny can't seem to get away from guys like Barnes. - What do you mean? - Oh, well, he was just telling me about his dad. Like Barnes, he's a control freak. His dad wants him to join the family law firm, but Kenny doesn't want to. He wants to be his own person. - You really like this Kenny, huh? - He's alright, but don't worry, Mom, I couldn't even imagine dating my TA. School's complicated enough. Especially with the murder and everything going on. Are you OK? - You... Can you believe this? - Hey... it's gonna be OK. Justice will prevail. - And where did you learn that? - I wonder. Here. For you. - Thank you. - It'll be OK, Mom. - Jocelyn, hey! - Oh... - You OK? You look a little shaky. - Do you have a moment to talk? - Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, come on. Can I get you anything? - Peace of mind would be nice. - So why didn't you tell the police? - There were too many reputations at stake. Bruce's, mine... and even though he's already gone, Carson's. Plus, Bruce made me swore that I would keep it to myself. - Why tell me? Why now? - Once I heard that interview with Abby Knight, I realized that she could go to jail for a crime she didn't commit. A crime that I could be responsible for. I just couldn't keep it inside anymore. I had to tell someone. You were so kind to me last time, I... I just felt that I could trust you. Can I? - Of course you can trust me. Jocelyn, this is actually the person you should be telling this to. Do you know Abby Knight? - Oh... Hi. How... - Thanks, Jenna. How long were you and Carson Howell an item? - Almost a year. I was just so lonely with Bruce, but... I didn't want to divorce him either. Beneath all that bluster, Bruce is just a terribly sad and sensitive man. - It sounds like you finally did want to divorce him, though. - I was in love with Carson, not Bruce. I needed to make a stand, move my life forward, but... I guess it just wasn't meant to be. I want to Millston that morning to tell Carson that I loved him and I was gonna leave Bruce, and when I finally told him, he just... shut down. He actually seemed shocked that after all this time, I had such strong feelings for him. He ended it with me right then and there. I was devastated. I didn't know what to do. I tracked down Bruce in one of the classrooms and I made him speak with me and... I told him everything. I had never seen him so furious. He was so vulnerable and disappointed. And that's when Bruce made me swear that I wouldn't tell a soul. It was a terrible scene for everyone. I hung around the campus for about an hour or so, thinking, then I went back to Bruce's office to... I don't know, just talk, apologize, see if he'd calmed down. That's when I found out Carson was dead. - Think your husband killed him? - I think he called Carson into his office and confronted him, and then they fought, and then Bruce ended up slamming that pencil into his neck. Bruce is a very precise man. - That's exactly what Belinda said. - Jocelyn, you don't have any proof, right? - Just a theory. One that I desperately hope is untrue, but... I'm also afraid that it might not be. - Jocelyn, can we just back up a bit? After the murder, you said that when you went back to the law department, you bypassed the police and walked straight into the building. Did you? [Sighing] - No, not exactly. For obvious reasons, I couldn't tell that cop that I'd spent the last hour in a second floor bathroom being sick to my stomach over everything. - Which means that you were already in the building when the murder took place. - What exactly are you trying to say, Ms. Knight? - Only that... I completely understand why you kept all this from the police. - Well, let's be clear. I wanted to love Carson Howell, not kill him. - I get it. Just because she didn't send the roses doesn't mean she didn't kill him. - It also doesn't mean she did. - She sure was quick to throw Barnes under the bus for Howell's murder. - Come on, she said it's just a theory. And frankly, I think it's a plausible one. - So? - So what? - Where does it leave us? - Well, obviously it's some new info. Maybe it's time to bring out the old suspect board. [Laughing] - Yes, yes, yes! Thank you! - Whoa! Thank you. - Tomorrow morning, OK? Bloomers. Strategy meeting. - I'll be there. Donuts or Danishes? - Surprise me. - I will. - Thank you. Bye. - See you in the morning. - Bye! Walter Pierce? Wait... - So... - Right. Take a look at this photo. This photo was taken right after the verdict in the Dermabrir case. [Laughing] - Sorry, it's just... it's a great glamour shot of you. - OK, focus, please. Please pay attention. OK, look here. That's Howell. That's Walter Pierce, from Dermabrir. Behind him is Kenny Lipinski. - OK, so? - Kenny told me that he first met Pierce at Howell's memorial, but this case was a year ago. - OK, why not say anything? - I don't know. Either he legitimately forgot or he's protecting Howell... or Pierce? - Or himself. - Sorry I'm late! I just... Yes! This is exciting! What changed? - Proof that Jocelyn and Howell were linked together. Still a question about Belinda, but if everybody else's stories are changing, why not hers, right? - Even if Reilly's already cleared her name? - Especially if Reilly's already cleared her name. I think another trip out to Millston College is in order, specifically to see Belinda. Wanna come with me, partner? - Name the time. - Later today? I don't know. I've got a ton of work to do, then I leave right for vacation. - Vacation? Um, I'd really only need a few minutes. [It'd really help, especially if you're going away.] - I don't understand, Ms. Knight. What more can I tell you? - [I just have] a couple more questions. Really, I will be fast, I promise. [Sighing] - OK. Be here by 6. - [Thank you.] - Thanks for letting me know, I appreciate it. Bye. Ugh! Well, I had a shipment scheduled for 4, but they're running late and I have to be here to sign for it. - Well, if we don't leave now, we'll miss Belinda. She's going on vacation. Can you believe that? - Well, people do take vacations, Abby. - While they're being investigated for murder? - That's only by you now. Let's remember that. Go ahead, I'll catch up as soon as I can. Maybe we can talk to Kenny too. - Text me when you're on your way. - Alright, will do. Be careful, OK? - I'm sorry, but I have to get these letters out before I go. I can't talk after all. - Please, it really won't take a long time. Five minutes. Four minutes. It won't take... Wait, three minutes. Two. Please. - OK, go. - I know that you said you had no romantic interest in Howell, but I've heard otherwise. - I didn't say I never had any interest in him, I said nothing ever happened between us. - I don't understand. - Sure, I had a crush on Carson when I started working here. Every woman does. Did. And at first, we flirted a little. A lot. I knew it was unprofessional, but once I realized how many women he juggled, I knew I didn't want to be part of that club. - And he was OK with that? - Not at all. The more I resisted, the more he pursued. And once I got a serious boyfriend, Carson got even more aggressive. - And this went on for ten years? - He calmed down over time. And honestly, we were friends, we worked really well together, but I vowed if it ever started up again, I'd quit. - And? - And it did. On the day he was murdered. - The morning he was killed? - That morning, he followed me into Professor Barnes' office and he told me that he'd just ended a relationship and he was free again and maybe now was the time for us to finish what we never started. I finally had to threaten to quit, and... that totally set him off. I mean, I literally had to fight to get out of there. It was crazy. But I certainly didn't stab him to death, even... even if he made me want to. Look, I have to go. - OK. Yeah. Thank you. I really am sorry about your friend Carson. He was my friend too, and... despite his flaws, nobody deserves to die like that. - They have decided to name a lucrative clerkship after him, so I guess he will always be remembered. - Yeah. - Too bad Carson won't be around for... Lauren Kaplan to thank. - Lauren Kaplan? - Yeah, this year's recipient. [Cell phone buzzing] Look, I have to go. That's my car. I wish I could stay and help, but I've got a plane to catch and some margaritas waiting for me to wash this all behind me. I hope they find the killer, Ms. Knight. But it's not me. [Cell phone buzzing] Ugh, I'm coming! - Have a good trip. Kenny Lipinski. Oh... "Dear Kenny, after extensive consideration, "we regret to inform you "that you will not be receiving the clerkship as requested. Carson Howell". The day before he was murdered. Oh! Of course! Kenny! [Dialing] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up-- - [Hey, it's Marco. Leave a message at the beep.] - Marco, I know that you're on your way, but I think Kenny Lipinski killed Carson Howell. Oh, Sydney! Oh baby, come on! Oh, pick up! - [Hey, it's Sydney. Leave a message after the beep.] - Sydney, it's Mom. Call me back as soon as you get this. It's urgent, honey. Is Detective Reilly in? - What, uh, what brings you here? Let me guess. You came to propose a peace offering to Professor Barnes. - Ha, nope. That ship has definitely sailed. Uh, what brings you here? - Oh, I have office hours in a bit. I figured I'd just come in and start packing up Howell's office. Someone's got to. Is that Professor Howell's stationery? - Oh! Yeah. Evidently, some of his old mail didn't go out, according to Belinda, whom I came to see. But she's gone now, so... They're, uh, they're evidently just rejection letters to the other students that didn't get the clerkship. The one Howell recommended you for. - That's interesting. I don't remember Howell mentioning anything about sending out personal notes. Or Belinda, even. - She did say that they must've just gotten lost in the stabbing--shuffle. Um, hey, Kenny, can I ask you a question? You told me that you met Walter Pierce from Dermabrir for the first time at Professor Howell's memorial? - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. - Take a look at this article. Isn't that you standing behind Pierce? With your hand on his shoulder? - Uh, yes. Yes, it certainly seems that way. - Oh, so you did meet him before the memorial. - I know how you feel about Dermabrir. Can you really blame me for not wanting you to know that I did their legal work? - I thought Howell handled it. - Well, officially, yes, but I did all the briefs, I did all the research... All Howell did was sign off on them. - What else did you lie about? - What are you talking about? Why are you doing this? - Kenny, you can tell me. It's OK. I'm really, really sorry about that clerkship, Kenny. I know how much you counted on it. - You... you have no idea. I deserved that job, too. I did everything that Howell asked. Every brief, every syllabus, right down to the most tedious task, just so he could look good. - What happened? - What hap--he got greedy! OK? He succumbed to the power and the money of the almighty... Kenneth Lipinski Sr. - Are you saying that your father bribed Howell not to give you the clerkship? - Let me tell you something about... about the Lipinski family, OK? Sons follow in their father's footsteps. See, I'm supposed to take the reins of the family business, or a dynasty collapses. This job was a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity for me. Do you understand that? Think about it: the Justice Department, Washington DC--this was my ticket to the big time. And away from Lipinski and sons, I would never have to answer to my father again! So... I... had to take the law into my own hands. - So, Kenny, did you, uh... did you film that angry video of me? - I had to warn you somehow. Before you started getting too close. - To what? To finding out you killed Professor Howell? - That was a nice touch with the black roses, by the way, Ms. Knight. - You sent them. How did you-- - Sydney told me all about your flower shop. I figured, why not? Did you like my note? Couldn't you have sworn one of Howell's scorned women wrote it? [Door opening] - Hi, Sydney, what are you doing here? Why didn't you call me back? - It's Kenny's office hours. I didn't see you in the hall. My phone died. - Go right now! No, stop! - Stay back! Stay back! I'm good with this thing. - OK. - Hand me the letter. Shut up! Hand me the letter. - It's gonna be OK, honey. Here, take it. Alright, now let her go! - Stand back! - Let her go, Kenny. Nobody has to know anything about this. But killing Professor Howell does not change the fact that he gave the clerkship to someone else. - No, see, that's where you're wrong. Howell didn't get a chance to send out any notification to the applicants. I can still take the job. I just gotta get rid of all of those letters, then it's your word against mine. And in case you've forgotten, you are the prime suspect here, not me. - OK. Take 'em. Take all the letters. - Why don't you get them for me? My hands are kinda full. - Mom... - It's gonna be OK, honey. - Mom! - No! - Mom! - Quiet. [Moaning] - Abby, what happened? Abby, can you hear me? Abby, are you OK? - Oh, Marco... He's got Sydney. I couldn't warn her in time. - Abby, look, I got here as fast as I could. I called you and-- - There they are! Go down the right, I'll go down the center. Hurry! - Don't say a word. Don't say a word. - Mom! - Quiet! - Let her go! Just let her go, OK? Please. It doesn't have to be this way. Kenny, just let her go. - It's over, Lipinski. It's over, man. [Police radio chatter] - Well, I suppose I owe you an apology. - A simple "thank you" will do. - Thank you. Although, for the record, we were zeroing in on Kenny Lipinski. - No, you weren't. - OK, let's just say that we hadn't officially ruled him out. - Well, maybe next time you'll take me more seriously. Not as a suspect. - And if you need help at the department, Abby can always do some pro bono work on the side. - I think we'll be fine. - OK. - Ms. Knight... stay out of trouble. - Mom! You were awesome. You saved my life. Thank you. And Marco. - You are welcome. - You don't have to thank me. It's part of being a mom. - You should tell Nikki to send him flowers. - Oh no, no, no. I'm staying out of the revenge roses business. - Yes, that'd be a good idea. - Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry about Kenny. I know you liked him a lot. - Why do I suddenly feel like I have the worst taste in men? - Oh no, do not worry about that. See, taste in men is genetic, and lucky for you, I am your mother. - And lucky for your mother, Marco here runs the bar next door. - And that's lucky why? - Stay with me for dinner, ladies? Little four-alarm chili? I gotta be honest, it's something special. It's really good. Closed Captioning by SETTE inc.
