Your head's outside the window like an animal! What's the problem, daddy? The Fashion Lover A Film By Marco Pollini Because of that bitch... I have to stay alone. Stella, go to play. Hey, Stella. Look what I took for you. What is it? How beautiful! Where did you find it? Come on, play with it. Haven't you finished yet? But...yes. I'm doing it. When you finish school... You'll help me with the land and with the livestock. And next year you won't attend school. Finished, stop. No more. You don't need school. Is anybody there? Can you hear me? Every human being has been given the divine power to shape their life. And I want to do it with these fabrics. During the night, while everyone is asleep, I get up. And I lift this cloth to my sewing machine. This is the way I enter to my world. Cutting, sewing, embroidery... It's wonderful to think about dressing... The most important models from all over the world. There is a person in my life who is teaching me the work. He gave me this great passion. And I'm very happy about that. I cultivate it, I make it grow. Drop by drop. It is as if I had created a double life. A parallel life. But I don't know if it's the right thing to do. During the day I suffer the wickedness of my father. But the night... night is mine. Yes. He's got the day... but I have got the night. And you? What would you have done to follow your passion? Stella, come on, wake up. It's already 7:30 am. Come on, we have to go to school. Good morning! Good morning. Do I have to prepare the breakfast? Yes please. Let's go. Have you studied for today? Will you lend me the notebook? So I can refresh the notes. Sure, no problem. - I forgot it... So the notebook? Yes, yes. You can do better, come on. Beautiful! Giovannino! What's happening? Do you already feel like going to the beach? So. We arrived at page 112 in the model making book. For Monday you have to study to page 220. And the t-shirt story. But teacher, I can't study all this during summer. Yes, you can. And Monday there will be the last test. Nooo! But teacher. Silence, silence! Or I'll give you more. What happened to you? Poor you... Template paper, loose point, basting. Cotton thread or nylon thread, remove basting. Final cut, finishing touch, finished dress. Giovannino, what's happening? Aren't you happy that today is the last day of school? Yes, teacher. It's not that. It's that... I have some problems at home. I am sorry about it. Ah, regarding home... Your parents never came once to the talks this year. And... it's important. It is important that your father or mother come. I have to make some decisions. Teacher... here, at school, the decisions must be made by teachers. Leave the parents out of those things. Anyway, thank you for all you taught me this year. Ah, teacher, could I take these fabrics? Yes of course, take all you want, Giovannino. Ah, make sure you join the fashion show for the final exam. Find a model. Do one of those beautiful dresses that only you can do. Yes, but I don't know if my father will let me. But, I'll think about it. Thanks teacher. Bye Giovannino. Dad. I have finished. What are you wearing? Nice eh? I made it at school. You make gay shirts at school? It's trendy! Trendy... I'll give you trendy. Go away! What do I have to do with this son? Lousy of a father! Lord please. Help my father. Lord please. Help my father. You are perfect! I'm the stylist's father. Congratulations! Damn you! Where the fuck did you go? Look! Look what a mess she left me. That bitch. I should not have children... With such a slut drug addict. Damn! Stella. Be quiet. Quiet, don't listen to all these things. Do you want to play? Giovanni, let me see. Beautiful shirt, where did you get it? Eh, I made it. I sewed and everything. This is what I study. Promise me that when I get married you'll do a dress for me. Ah, yes. Yes Stella... But... who is he? Hey, hi! You will do a dress for me as well, eh? Curious little boy. Giovannino, so? Ah yes. Will you do the dress for me? - I told you I'll do it. Mommy! Why are you here? Where have you been? Thanks God you came back, Mommy. No, Giovannino, I did not came back. I came to get some things. But I have to leave. Buy Mommy, it is impossible to live with Dad. He is a crazy maniac. I beg you Mommy. Can we come with you? I can not take you with me, Giovannino. And be quiet, if your father hears me, he'll kill me. One day you'll understand. Take care of your sister. Mom. Please mom. Please! I can't! Whoever abandons a child, it is as if they abandons himself. I think I read that in a book. My mother left us. I can't believe it. Abandonment, separation. They are strong words for a child. Almost a nightmare. And who knows how my sister Stella lives it. She left without even telling us that she will come back. If she will come back. Maybe... Maybe it's really my fault. Maybe I shouldn't have created this double life. Now she would still be here, with us. Ever since I was a child, I've always seen her a bit... strange. She was really old to have me and my sister. Also my dad. My dad always treated her... Worse than his beasts. I really don't know what to say. And you? What would you have done to keep your mother from leaving? Giovannino, Is it true what Dad says about mommy? No Stella, don't worry. Mommy will come back one day. Giovannino, I'm hungry. Stella, I'm busy, come on! Giovannino, I'm hungry... I'm hungry. That's fine. I'm going to find something to eat. Don't go away and don't touch this, got it? Ok. Oh, if I catch you, rascal! Hey, Hi! I'm Domenico. You made these clothes? Where's your model? What? Why all these questions? I made all these clothes and these busts for nothing. I don't even have a model. Leave me alone, please. Listen. I have always remained aloof. Behind the scenes. Now stop! It's time to come out! I'm here to help you. So... I can be your model. Shut up, please. So... now am I ok? Wow! What do you say? That's fine, go! Let's go! Dress me. Come on. I think you're ready. No. Wait. These no. Ok, you have to go when the new music begins. Go. Good, Giovannino, good, everybody likes your dress. Thank you, teacher. Thanks a lot. See you later. Dear students, dear parents, we are here to celebrate... The most important day, the day of achievement, and judging. In one year of effort you have distinguished yourselves for your commitment. But among the many talents of this school... There is one particularly good student. Considered the best. His name is Giovannino Sanna. Compliments, Giovannino! We are in front of a school! Get out of the car! Get dressed, we're in a public place. It's not my fault. He's a pig. Calm down, calm down. Now you're coming with us. You're hurting me! Good Giovannino! Congratulations. Come with me, Giovannino. Let's go. It's not my fault. It's my wife's fault because she left me, that bitch! Mr. Sanna, try to be quiet! I am quiet... but she is a slut. I'm going to talk to the officer. He will do it again. He was in front of a school with children. I am going to the chief. Antonio. It's the second time you've done something like that. You risk losing your children. Wait a second here. Murru, listen to me. Who is it? Stella, go play in your room. Who is it? Municipality sent me here Giovannino. Can you open the door? Can I enter? You're welcome. I'm Lucia, the social worker. Mom isn't here? Dad hasn't come back yet. No. Ah... can I enter? Please, take a seat. So tell me. How are you? You and your sister are here alone now. You know what happened yesterday, right? The situation is delicate. In these cases we must look for a solution. Listen... I am very ashamed of what my father did. And I'm really sorry for my family. But... He's a good father. He takes care of our house, of us. Of the livestock... Well... you don't have to worry. We need to... Wait some time. We will make everything clear. I'll try to understand where your father is. And we'll meet again in a few days. Will you accompany me? Yes, sure. Bye! Goodbye! Dad, everything's ok? Do you need something? Leave me alone. Take care of the livestock. Come on! What happened to dad? Now we also have a depressed father, Stella. This was not needed. What does "depressed" means? Never mind. Stella, today you come to the pasture with me, ok? I don't want to. I'll lock you in the room today and tonight. Also tonight? Look, women sleep with one eye opened and one closed. Don't make a fuss. That's enough. That's fine, I'll come. Well, Giovannino, have you finished? I'm coming. Move away. Let's go. Dad. At least eat something. I told you to leave me alone. But Dad. You need to eat. I don't want anything. Go away! Musie, Musie, Musie Template paper, loose point, basting. Cotton thread or nylon thread, remove basting. Final cut, finishing touch, finished dress. Stay! Stay! What happened? Come on! Get the towel, stupid. Traitor, like your mother. Traitor. Cheers! It's good! Stuff for gentlemen. Vernaccia from Oristano. Listen. You know what happened to the wife of the shepherd Gianni? Gianni who? Gianni De Lussu. Ah, the one from Aggius. Who died. Yes, that one. What happened? The sale of the land that had made her husband. The famous land that he sold to Berlusconi. Berlusconi... Ah ah ah. Yes Berlusconi. The land was property of Berlusconi. He's got many lands in Sardinia. Again, the land was property of Berlusconi. Did Berlusconi give it to Gianni? No, he did not give him anything. He grazed his sheep. Berlusconi knew nothing about it. When he found out, it was too late. Because 20 years had passed. And you know that after 20 years the usucapion law is triggered. Then there was a trial. And to have the possession again, you know how much Berlusconi had to give to Gianni? How much? 900,000 Euros. With 900,000 Euros, do you know how many women you can have? So he became rich? He should have. Why he should have? Gianni died, I told you. And the wife? It is not known if the wife is aware of all this. It seems that this money has been buried. Perhaps only one knows where that money is. Yes, the dog. That land Antonio! That land is an immense vastness. Where is this land located? From Arzachena to Palau. It's all full of rocks and everything. Who knows where he hid that money. It's a nice land for goats. Maybe also for your girlfriends. 900,000 Euros. Women for all your life! No one knows where that money is. Unless... What the... You again? That's enough. Who are you? What do you want from me? I saved you at the show. And you treat me this way! I wanted to thank you, but you disappeared. Why do you always look for me? Well, I am your guardian angel. What the... guardian angel? I don't need anybody. Tell me. What are your dreams? I dream to go away from here. From you, from my father, from everybody. I dream exactly my dream. Milano. And I dream to dress the most beautiful women in the world. Listen. Remember that we are not different. We are just more sensible. We are specials. What the... fuck you, fag. Good morning teacher! Hi Giovannino! How is it going? Well, everything's ok, thanks. At home? Well, yes... everything solved. Look! They are preparing for the fashion show. All the village will participate. You knew that, didn't you? No, teacher, if you did not tell me! I want you to partecipate representing the school. You are the best, Giovannino! Come on! You know I'm reluctant to praise in this way. But you deserve it. Teacher, how can I do this? No, I can't do it. I have no dresses, no models. Don't worry about the models. I'll take care about it. You only have to think about the dresses. You have talent! You can do something beautiful, new, special! All right. Good morning, Mr. Antonio! Good morning. Get in the car. Hurry up! I'll think about it, thanks teacher. Bye Giovannino. Put the bicycle inside. Damn! I'll kill you! Hurry up. You got my whole car wet. Stupid! What did you want to do? What was your teacher talking about? School's out. Right? Right. So? Nothing. You're crazy. Take out your bike. Giovannino. Can you tell me what the teachers told you? No, nothing dad. I am your father. You can trust me. I can help you. All right. She asked me if I want to participate in this fashion show. Do you have to catwalk? No, it's something for the school. I have to present some dresses sewn by me You have to get these thoughts out of your head. You must think to the land. Do you see this stone? This is real life. Real life is down there. Look. This is the life. Not the bullshit that school teaches you. You never understood shit, did you? Ah ah ah. The little man gets angry. I don't want to be like you! I want to go away from you, and from these shitty animals. I want to do what I like. Fashion, my fashion. Ahh... Fashion. You again! What do you want from me? Why do you treat me this way? I just want to help you. I don't want any help. Tonight there is the fashion show, you must participate. Fuck. Why do you care so much? Just because you once catwalked for me... It gives you the right to tell me what to do? You know what? I will not participate. Here everyone believes in you. Everyone who? Who are they? Where are they? Listen, I'll tell you as friend. You have a gift. If you don't cultivate it, it's as if you didn't have it. Fuck you. Take this. 20 drops of this to your father. And go to the fashion show. I don't want your bullshit. Do the right thing. When's my mom coming back? She's not coming back. That bitch. Your mom is not coming back.. Stop whistling. I'll kill you. Sure. Now you'll see. Bravo! Eat so you keep your mouth busy. Please, Stella. Why are you laughing? Come on Stella, let's go to our room. Goodnight dad. Bitch. Look! That is the dress made by Giovannino! Wow! Very interesting. I want to meet him. Giovannino! Bravo! Thank you. I would like to introduce you to someone. - Hello! This is Marco. You know boy. You have great skills. I work in the fashion industry in Milan. We do a course about new technologies used in fashion. Wow! Why don't you invite me to your school? It's not that easy. Only a few have the privilege of entering our school. Oh, right. It is always about money. Listen. I'll give you... My business card. Make sure you call me. Bravo! Keep it up. 900,000 Euros. Where is this land located? From Arzachena to Palau! It seems that this money has been buried. No one knows where! Look for the coin. - Grandma! Look for the coin. Grandma! Look for the coin. Thank you, see you. Who knows where it will be? Yes, find it. I will have seen a thousand sheep today! Stay still! What's this? Is this a coin? It's a key. Excuse me. Could you tell me what kind of key this is? My grandma's got alzheimer's and she doesn't remember. Let me see. It looks like an armored door key. No, actually it is a safe box key. You know the little one? Hey! Where are you going? Hey, a wire! Then it is true that they hid them underground. It cannot be! I can't believe it. Oh my god! Yes! I've done it! Hi! What's up? What will you do now? Listen. We have nothing to do with our parents' crap. Go away from here. Why walk, if you can fly? Take this. It's your mother's address. Go to her. Why do you have it? I know everything. Remember that. This is the cinema that I like. The rough, free-range one, true. And also a little dreamy, I'd say. Hand-held camera. Clean lens. And then go. Recite. In life we recite continuously. Maybe to look nicer, more attractive. In fact no one wants losers. Who wants the melancholy, sick, sad people? Even if... They have something unique. In them there is something intense, pure. Something alive. Are you still there? Can you hear me? I was lucky. Very lucky. To find all this money. With money but without ideas, you don't go anywhere. Come on, Giovannino! Come on, wake up! What will you do now? Come on! Wait. Come Stella. Let's go, Stella. Giovannino! Mommy! Honey! My loves. What are you doing here? Mom, let us in. You can't live with me. I just can't. Mom sit down, please. But I... I need to talk to you. This is for our new life. From now on everything will change. SOME MONTHS LATER We're going to the school located in Via Alessandria, please. Let's go. So here I am. A little man in the big city. I did it! Yes! Everything is new and everything is going to begin. I open the book. It's my life. I read, write and draw. I turn the page and I dream. And the dream comes true. Yes, we are... Small, mediocre and sometimes even insignificant men. That become heroes. Big, huge... Dream machines and work machines. We, who never stop ourselves. We, who write a new page of our life every day. And I want to write mine. Yes, we are small, mediocre and sometimes even insignificant men. That become heroes. Big, huge dream machines and work machines.
