You have another one of those? Yeah. Thank you. [Puffing] You're welcome. It's a cool spot, by the way. You like it? Yeah, it's kind of not terrible. I guess. I wasn't sure if you'd be happy to see me. [Scoffs] How'd you find me? Facebook. DAVID: I don't have Facebook. Not Facebook, the um, Instagram. Oh, obviously. Yeah, you just popped up in my feed. On the feed, right? Randomly. DAVID: Based on an algorithm. Um, you want some coffee? Yes. So you make wine now. I came here after Dublin and worked for the old man that owned the place. Wait, you've been here since Dublin? Yeah. TOM: Wow, good for you! You're really pulling off the whole ex-pat thing. Anyway, after a couple of years, the old man died and he uh, left it to me. He didn't have any kids? DAVID: Two daughters, actually, but he was an asshole. I think I was the only one who could put up with him. TOM: Well, you have a talent for that. You were never an asshole. Does that work? That? Um, I don't know, maybe. That's like a 1,000-dollar espresso machine and you're using a moka pot. It's not fucking complicated, David. DAVID: Nah, it's okay, really, I like it like this. Mm-mm. DAVID: Oh, shit. Empty. [Tom clears throat] [Sighing] You're very good at that. TOM: I should be. I was a barista in Auckland last year. What? What? What do you mean what? Are you okay? I mean I feel like a ghost is making me coffee, but yeah. You're so dramatic. DAVID: You remember the last thing you said to me? - You said, "I'll see you soon." - Yeah, but I always say that. That was six years ago. I thought you went out for cigarettes. I found 'em. [Scoffs] You weren't too heartbroken, were you? No, I wasn't heartbroken. I know. It's just an expression. Right. Where have you been? I've been everywhere, man. Still on that kick. TOM: Mmhmm. I thought maybe you would have settled down, met somebody or had a kid or... TOM: Not quite. I was dating this Argentinian chick for a bit. That's about as close as I got. We even signed a lease together. A lease, wow. What happened? Oh, you know me, I'm an asshole. Someone else here? Yeah. You got a girlfriend? DAVID: No. You got a wife and five kids? Yeah. Yeah? One for every year you were gone. - Oh! - That's how I cope. Busy. No, it's just kind of a sunup to sundown kind of a thing. So... That's Rob. Rob? Em's husband Rob. Oh, fuck! Thinks-I-stole-his-bike Rob. That's the one. Ooh. Do they live with you? No, they're visiting. He does social media marketing and I suck at that stuff. Of course, you didn't make your own Instagram. No, I didn't. Looks good, though? It looks really good. [Chuckling] Maybe I should come back later. What? No. Fuck that. We have catching up to do. I haven't seen your stupid face in six years. Yeah, but he really doesn't like me, David. I'm sure he's gotten over it. Davy boy. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey, man, have you seen today's paper... Paper? DAVID: Rob, you know my friend, Tom. Hi, Rob. Why... why... why is this happening? Tom, you know my brother-in-law. ROB: Hi, Natalie. I've been trying to send you a bill. Do you have a permanent address or you still... Still eating out of exotic garbage cans? Woohoo! Fuck off, Rob. [Kissing] Fuck you, Natalie. What is this? You didn't say she was gonna be here. Yeah, it was kind of an early morning surprise. Oh, cool! Like bed bugs. And I see we're smokin' inside now? I made an exception this morning. Well, that's great. Um... [Chuckles] 'Cause uh, that's how it starts and pretty soon you're smoking again. She's making coffee. Yeah, do you want one? Uh, I can make my own. Thank you. She's very good at it. ROB: I'm sure. Where's uh... Where's... where's the rest of it? Oh, I couldn't find kindling. ROB: You couldn't f... It's... it's a stove! You don't need kindling. Oh my God. The hearth is gas-lit. Oops.

You know? Like humans do. TOM: Does Gwen read? Well, she was a horse, Tom, and she's dead, so, no. But look, I'd found it under a tree and she loved trees. Okay, what was her favorite tree then? Well, the persimmon tree on the edge of Madame Gérard's yard. Fuck, that is fucking specific. I don't know if she liked all of 'em. They're toxic for horses, actually, but you can keep her away from now on. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go to Madame Gérard's property, and we're goonna get some persimmons, and we're gonna eat the persimmons, and then scatter the pits on Gwen's grave, and say some nice stuff about her. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, seeds, not pits, but that, while a beautiful picture, would probably not be Madame Gérard's favorite plan. Then we don't tell Madame Gérard. Or we could just use this rock. [Chuckles] Fine. Oh, not fine. [Chuckling] [Grunts] [Sighing] Why did you leave? Huh? Why'd you bail on me in Dublin? [Sighing] I dunno. I needed to see Asia. Asia? I mean I know you wanted to see Asia... Okay, I'm sorry. No, I don't want you to regret anything. I don't regret anything. I'm just sorry. [Taking deep breaths] I mean I'm a little bit sorry. Okay. [Chuckles] I'm kidding. [Takes a deep breath] I am sorry, though. [Taking deep breaths] You know, I really did go out to get cigarettes. I nearly smoked the whole pack sitting on a metal bench, freezing my ass off missing trains. Well, that's good to know. Hey, we don't have to... [Takes a deep breath] Be like that. I'm just telling you the truth, I'm telling you what happened. I did. It always starts off the same way. [Taking deep breaths] It's like one more kiss, five more minutes in bed. [Tom takes a deep breath] Another hour over coffee, another week collecting dog-eared coasters, another year of fucking Dublin. We were in Dublin two months. Yeah, but you know what I mean! I just thought that you would get it. I did, I think. I think I did. I just... I wish you'd say "goodbye". Or you know, stay for Christmas. [Chuckles] Why? Did you get me a present? [David scoffs] Oh my God, you did. You got me a fucking Christmas present. - No, I... - TOM: And I just bailed. It wasn't a big deal, really. I just didn't know! I thought you were going home for Christmas. I was. I changed my ticket. For me? No, not for you. Um, there was this other girl that I was seeing. [Chuckling] Yeah, of course, I wanted to spend it with you. [Sighs] You didn't spend it alone, did you? No, not all day. There was a little Indian restaurant that was open. Oh my God, that's the fucking saddest thing I've ever heard. Anyway, ancient history. I told you I suck at dating! I know, you did. You were very clear. I even specifically said to you once, I remember, "I'm going to bail one day." You did. You're good, honestly. [Tom sighing] That's Madame's property. Uh-huh. DAVID: Madame Gérard, she comes over for lunch every Tuesday. - And that's the... - Oh. Garden labyrinth that the old man left. And in the center of it, there's a... Hey, not on the vineyard! Hey! What? DAVID: I said, "Don't take it out by the grapes." What? I told you to keep it away from the grapes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll do it again, it's so fun. [Chuckling] Oh my God, dude. Hey, I'm goin' into town, there's a horse for sale. Thought I'd check it out. Hey, but you know, I've gotta see it first. I know. I'm just gonna go out there, take some snaps while we're still posting. Gotta stay proactive, you know? We gotta replace her sooner than later. Yeah, man, but she hasn't been in the ground an hour. Yeah. I'm sorry I missed that. But uh, you know, we can't get caught up in the past. Gotta make a clean slate. You told me every day, those grapes are on the vine, we lose bottles. Not to mention the palate, matrix or whatever. Right? - Yeah. - All right. Listen to that. Vive la France. You don't have to go with him? No, I got an appointment with a stable tomorrow. Hmm. What was I gonna s... Oh, shit, Em wants something. She uses a bell? Why doesn't she just text you? I still don't own a phone. Oh. And if I did, I wouldn't take it out in the vineyard. Why not? Because that whole half of the estate is entirely organic. DAVID: No electricity, no chemicals, no machinery that wouldn't have been around when the chateau was built. TOM: So wait, that's why the horse? DAVID: Yeah, that's why the horse. TOM: Oh. DAVID: She couldn't have died at a worst time either, too. It's harvest. What? Nothin'. Should we go find Em? No, she can wait. I wanna show you somethin'. Come on. Okay. [Sighing] This is my safe place. What? It's just the 13th century looks really good on you. So is this this year's um, vintage? DAVID: No, this year's is still on the vine. And most of last year is in a larger cellar by the winery. This is the family cellar. Hmm. [Sighs] Tell me something you've never told anybody. What? Why? Because I'm about to show you a secret and I need assurances. Come on! What are we, 10? Just tell me something. Oh, fine. Um... [Sighing] I had an abortion. Oh. I had an abortion. TOM: Yeah, a few years ago. Well, don't look at me like that. It's not a big deal. No, I mean, I know. I know it's not. It's... it's not if it's not for you. It's not. Okay. Okay, so what's your secret? [Chuckles] Fine, okay. [Grunting] Wait, how is that a secret? Well, it's electricity on the vineyard. So I told you that I had an abortion and you're showing me a record player. Oh. I'm sorry. No, I'm just fucking with you, I don't care. Jesus Christ, it's not funny, Tom. [Chuckling] It was funny. You did become Amish, though. Well, it just goes against my entire branding. Completely organic, totally vintage vintages. Yeah but, this is like part of the house anyway. Isn't it? Well, I think about it as part of the vineyard. Has anyone ever told you you're just a little bit uptight? Yeah, you told me that. I just... I don't know. When I commit to something an idea or whatever, an idea or whatever I like to really fully commit to it. I don't know, I guess that's weird. It's not weird. Well, anyway, I hadn't shown anybody and the only thing missing down here is music. Not a word. I told you it was stupid. It's not stupid. I guess the only question that matters now is what music are you risking this all for. Jesus. [Chuckling] Is it too early to start drinking? [Chuckling] This is France. Oh, boy! Hmm. That's the old man's special collection. Oh, yeah? What makes them so special? They're his best years. So his life's work, I guess. DAVID: Most of those 12 bottles have been here over a quarter century. That one, one down. - This one? - No. - That one? - That one. Was bottled the year I was born. Oh, is it still good? DAVID: Should be till I'm 75. but you never know till you open 'em. Wait, there's... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Yeah, there's 13 here, not 12. DAVID: Oh, that one. That one was... was me. Oh, cool! [David chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, David Pyne. [Chuckles] Here. Would it be sacrilegious to drink from the bottle, Mr. Vintage Vintage? [Chuckles] [Gulping] Mm, what is this? Mourvèdre. Mourvèdre. Mourvèdre. You have to say it like that. Mourvèdre. You've actually had it before. TOM: Have I? Yeah, we drank that on Dorset, the night of the fight. [Gulps] No, not the night of the fight. The night that you got your ass handed to you at Muddy's. DAVID: Okay. You thought I forgot. Okay, there was two of 'em. And they were a head taller than me. Nobody is a head taller than you. And wait, I was defending your honor. Yeah, which I definitely didn't asked you to do, by the way. Alright. Well, I connected a few times for the record, but no, it didn't exactly go the way I imagined. Yeah, well, I guess pub-fighting Did you think I went to Princeton? You think I went to Princeton? Yeah, some northwestern prep school. I don't know. Or northeastern? Where are those schools? Doesn't matter. [Chuckling] I don't have your memory, I don't know! Give me that. [Gulps] Why are you here, Tom? I told you, I saw you on Instagram. Yeah? You go visit everybody you come across on social media? Mm, maybe I have good memories. You missed me. Mm, don't get hard about it. What's next for you? Oh, I don't know. I haven't thought that far ahead. You know, you might have gotten predictable. I was actually thinking maybe I could um, help out around here for a bit. Oh, with your extensive gardening résumé? TOM: Yeah! Or I dunno, I could be like your personal barista or something. You wanna stay? [music ends] Maybe. DAVID: I could only give you room and board. What else do I need? - I have to warn you. - Oh, I know. that one day I'll just wake up with a start, and there'll be a cold espresso machine, and an empty ash tray, and this all would've been a drunken memory, and your voice will echo in my ears from years ago. And you'll say, "I'll see you soon." I was actually gonna say, "I don't make pumpkin spice lattes." No? I can live with that. That's a deal. ROSE: You should grab a beer. Whose is that? ROSE: It's Tom's. Who's Tom? It's mine. Oh, I'm sorry. No, you're not gonna make me drink alone, are you? I'm David. Natalie. Wait, who's Tom? I'm an idiot. No, you're not an idiot, she's an idiot. She's fucked up. [Rose chuckling] Do you know the difference between Old Tom's gin and regular gin? No. I'm sure you're gonna tell me. They add sugar. DAVID: It's named after the black cat plaques they hang above bars in old London. The Old Tom's is for the old tomcats. If this is you flirt, you're so bad at it. [Chuckling] Where are you from? Mm, nowhere really. DAVID: How long you here for? I don't know. What about you? I live around here now. Do you travel much? Nope. No, everybody's so crazy about movin' around. I'm on the other kick. Oh, what's that? Staying put. DAVID: I think it's gonna be a new, cool thing. 5, 10 years from now. Just never goin' anywhere. [Chuckling] [Kissing] Seriously, Tom, how do you not age? EM: Hi! Oh, I was so stoked to find out that you're here! Me, too. How's it going? Good. I gotta go make some calls. Okay, fuck off, we don't need you. Hey, listen uh, Gérard stopped by. She mentioned lunch on Tuesday. Is that like a tradition or something? Yeah, since long before I got here. So where have you been? Wait, are you hungry? Yeah, I'm fucking starving. - Let's go raid the fridge. - Yes. - I wanna hear about everything. - How long can you stay? I'm not sure yet! ROB: They love us. They love us, we got a spike. We've got a spike with the Portland hipsters, baby. That's the market we need. [Chuckles] Look more excited, man! - This is exactly what we want! - This is exactly what we want. It's me being excited. Alright, alright. It turns out there's a real market for this. Alright. All the other booze companies, they're... they're doin' the... The... the lifestyle thing. Nobody is doin' the... the style of life thing. This. I'm pretty sure that doesn't mean anything. [Coughs] [Clears throat] What? Was that a little confusing? No, it's not confusing. It's just it doesn't mean anything. Style of life and lifestyle are just the same thing, but you just mixed the words up. Oh, 'cause you're the marketing expert. Hmm. 'Cause you learned all about product branding selling hemp bracelets on the beach or whatever you did. Oh God. What I do know is that style of life is a term invented by Alfred Adler and it doesn't mean what you think it means. [Whistles] Yeah. You're the lifestyle expert. Hmm, maybe. Hey, so I looked at those photos you took of the horse you saw today and unfortunately I think he's way too small. Oh, solid pics, though, right? [Chuckles] They are. They're great, man, very great pics. Good. And uh, I made some calls and lined up some showings for tomorrow. Good, good, that's great, because people are begging for shots of the doing of the thing, you know? Like the... the harvest, the whole thing. They really, really want 'em. You with the... the straw hat, and the grapes, and the whole deal, you know? Okay. Look, I took this on equity cause your family but if... if this goes the way that it looks like it's goin', this is gonna be the best decision of my life. [Clears throat] [Grunts] Oh, God. [Chuckles] TOM: Did Rob sleep in? No, he'll just take any opportunity to work on the bike. EM: He got the special one from Craigslist or whatever they have here. You can't find this type in America apparently. Yeah, but how's he gonna get it back? Ask him. I stopped asking those kinds of questions. He busts his ass to keep us afloat. He deserves his play things. Said the '50s housewife. Huh? Nothing. Um, so wait, are you still doing your drawings? I wish, I don't have time. But you know, once Jasper starts school, I'll have a lot of time. I might go back to teaching yoga. I might even try oil painting, I always wanted to do that. Take some classes, the local university. That one looked healthy. Yeah, I just don't have the time or the experience to get him into shape. Rob said I'm supposed to make sure. you don't come home without a horse. [Chuckling] He also said we're supposed to take a picture with lots of color in it, flowers or a barn door something like that. Okay. We're gonna go find him a barn door. [Indistinct TV chatter] [Indistinct conversation] DAVID: I know, you mentioned that earlier. ROB: I know, I know, I know. Look, you get... you get working on your product. One way or another, I swear to God, you're gonna break... You're gonna break 20k followers by the end of the quarter. Hmm. [♪♪♪] Hmm. DAVID: Hey. I'm up. I'm up. DAVID: Sorry. [Takes a deep breath] [Grunts] Ooh, okey dokey! Oh! [Chuckling] Don't tell anyone. These things don't... they're not poisonous or anything? No. Oh-la-la. Is this your first time in France? Uh, France? Yes, yes. First time out of the country. Well, since our sons were born, she means. EM: Or in general. Well, no, we go to that... that Canadian city uh, every summer. EM: Vancouver twice, and Canada doesn't count. Where in America are you from? It's um, it's in the Pacific Northwest, right underneath Washington. Actually, Canada is closer than most of the rest of the country. Oh my God, what's... what's goin' on over there? She is asking us if we travelled much and we haven't. Very true, but you're breakin' my balls. How old is your son? - 7. - 4. We... we have two, 7 and 4. You think they're okay? ROB: They're fine, they're fine. EM: We should really FaceTime. EM: Why... why didn't we bring them? - Because they're monsters. - That's so mean, yeah. They're fine, they're fine. Speaking about which, the Hobart children are something, aren't they? They're good kids. They're thieves, which is the nicest thing I can think to say. Eating a few apples from your tree doesn't make them thieves. It certainly does. It technically doesn't. Well, seems a bit extreme. No, it's not. More wine? Oh yes, please. Oops! Sorry for that. Oh. [Chuckling] Yo. Does Madame Gérard have kids? - What do you think? - No. No. I was just about to tell Madame Gérard about that conversation we had. You remember camping outside Big Sur? Yeah, I do. So the um, the girls had a late-night hangout sesh by the fire-pit. You remember that? Mmhmm. You know, Tom is like this amazing traveler. It'... it's... Mmhmm. She's been everywhere. And she's the ultimate of this lost or I should say wondering generation, 'cause not all who wander are lost, right? So anyway, we were there and I was feeling loose, shall we say? And we were asking each other questions, and I asked her you know, if she wanted kids to have a family. Sort of a normal question for a girl or I should say a woman, for my generation, and certainly yours, the question of the ticking clock. And she says... you know, I think about this all the time. Tom, I really do. She says, "Yeah, I want five." Five kids. [Em chuckles] EM: I didn't wanna offend her. She's my brothers... You know, I mean, they were really close, but I had to know and I didn't understand how she was going to have five kids with no steady job, no steady anything. And she says, "I'm not on birth control. I'm not on birth control and I'm sure I'll have the baby accidentally by the time I'm 30." ROB: Babe. Oh, I'm tipsy, aren't I? - No, no, no, it's okay. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.. No, I just... I thought it was the greatest thing, because why should the word "accidentally" in that context be such a bad thing, right? I mean, the way she said it, and I don't know if you still feel this way, but the way she said it it was like the guy was an afterthought. And I mean why should what she wants be dependent on a guy? Okay. Uh, I'm paying her a compliment. No, no, no, no. It was a... a really big thought for me then. It... it still is. And you know, I think in that moment I really understood why my brother is... Was so in love with you. Okay, maybe we should... Let's clean up. - Clean-up time. - Did I say too much? [Chuckling] Just catchin' the best show in town. You mean the only show in town? TOM: Yes, I think. Are you tired of it, yet? DAVID: No. No, it's the only thing I'm not tired of. So we're going to the stables tomorrow, is that the plan? Yeah, I guess. Well, your enthusiasm is overwhelming. [David chuckling] Uh, just weird about replacing things, I guess. What? Do you think? What's that supposed to mean? That you are weird about replacing things. Okay. Come on, you've got tw... 13! You've got 13 bottles of wine that you won't touch, because... I'm saving 'em. For what? Your wedding? Your Amish bond-raising championship? - Okay. - Your funeral, my funeral? For someday. Okay, I know what you're thinkin'. I didn't say anything! Yeah, well, I hear you. There's no such thing. The trouble with that though, is that some people have these weird body parts uh, called "hearts". If you're not careful, what they'll do is they'll develop these really inconvenient feelings called "attachment". That's gross. Uh, and nothing like my childhood. Oh. No, but having a single dad in the military, No. But having a single dad in the military you do have to transition very quickly. It was like every other year. "Come on, we're going to this new country or this new school, you've got new friends, there's a new bed, new food." And the food, that was the... Yeah, that was what really got to me, the food. My dad was really health-conscious, so... ...we were never allowed to eat at like fast-food joints or have boxed cereal or any of that kind of stuff, you know? It always had to be healthy, local things, like things that you couldn't get just everywhere. And I was like a really picky kid. So it was exhausting deciding which new foods I hated every single time. [Chuckling] It was a full-time job. There was one thing that I was allowed, though, from the store on base. Oh, was it poptarts? No, it wasn't poptarts. I wish it had been poptarts. [Sighs] It was peanut butter. Peanut butter has been my like most constant thing. It's funny, that's one thing you can't get in France. Fuck. Do you think I'll live? [Sighs] You gotta get a new horse, dude. Yeah, I know. The grapes are gettin' drier every day, which means less of a yield and also... What? Mr. Social Media? Yeah. But to his credit though, I mean he's been busting his ass. I guess I have to. Come on, let's go. Where? Hey. Uh, what are we doin'? We're gonna say "goodbye" properly. It helps you to move on. Or at least, I've heard. Tom, I don't think we should. So wait, where is the tree? Listen, I'm serious. This isn't that important and I got a pretty good long-standing relationship with my neighbor right now. Look, if we get caught, I'll take 100% of the blame, alright? [Chuckles] So is it that way or that way? [Sighs] Mmhmm. All I see are leaves. It must be high up. Do you think this is strong enough to climb? I think we should get a ladder. No, we don't have time for ladder. This is a blitz fucking mission. [Grunts] Okay, I'm just... I'm gonna... Here, I'm gonna do something. Okay. [Grunting] Whoa, whoa. Okay, can you get up from there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. MADAME GÉRARD: Hey! Oh, shit! Go, go, go! Fuck! [Taking deep breaths] You didn't say there was a light. I've never been here after dark. Also, there are no persimmons in that tree. [Taking deep breaths] Oh, fuck. Pauline must have come. Who? The gardener. Oh. [Tom taking deep breaths] Hey, Hobart! [Speaks French] Hobarts? Yeah. [Speaking French] What's she saying now? She's comin' out with her shotgun. Not really. Don't worry, she's a horrible shot. Stop! She never comes past the patio. Wait, have you done this before?

Hmm, that was my dad's favorite poem of all time. Which one? DAVID: The title one. It's a narrative about a guy who's takin' this long walk through the woods, and he gets to a fork in the road, and he's contemplating what path to take, and it seems pretty innocuous, right? 'Cause he can't see too far down either of 'em, because all the leaves and stuff. So he just goes with the one that it seems like fewer people have taken and he says he'll save the other one for another day. Then, here's the kicker. "Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back." And you realize pretty quickly that he's not talkin' about some daily stroll in the woods, that the road is time, and that the stroll is life, and you don't get to go back. Well, that's fucking sad. Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. What do you think the fork in the road was for your dad? Oh, I don't know. Probably nothin'. He's a pretty sentimental guy on his own. Or maybe it was us.

Some chick fucked my life up. ♪ ...only a runner, just keep one foot... ♪ Shut up and close your eyes. [Laughing] ♪ ...there's only a runner... ♪ Come on. ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ Are you ripping it to pieces? [Chuckling] Yeah. Alright, now, try to land somewhere near the middle, because I hear the Antarctic is expensive. Okay. How'd I do? EM: I admire your way of thinking about life. What way is that exactly? You know, the way you wander around making it up as you go along. Sometimes I wish I could do that. See as much of the world as you do. TOM: I think you could. I mean, I know you've got kids and shit, but... ...I think if you wanna get out and not feel so trapped, you should just make the time and do it. I know Rob and I aren't exactly like that, but he seems woke enough to let you go and do your own thing every once in a while, right? You know, I tried, a few years ago, before Jasper. I got this idea in my head that I hadn't experienced enough of life and I needed to get out. I tried to talk to Rob about it and he freaked out, of course. Thought I wanted to leave him, get a divorce. I told him that when I said I wanted to experience more of life, it didn't mean I wanted to leave him. It meant I wanted to experience more of life. A real plot twist. Yeah. Anyway, you're right. He was completely cool with it. We arranged a couple of weeks for me to go wander, and he took charge of James and the babysitter, and daycare, and everything. And he actually seemed really genuinely excited for me. TOM: That's great. So where'd you go? Istanbul, Turkey. That is a massive leap! I know. I thought I'd just jump right in and go somewhere I never imagined I'd ever go. How was it? Awful. Terrible. I hated it. Was it really? [Chuckling] - Oh, no! - The coffee's undrinkable And like nobody speaks fucking English. - Yeah, no shit. - I know, I know. I know that's a stupid thing to say. I just never realized how scary it is to be a real foreigner, out there just completely on your own. EM: I've never done it before. And all I wanted was to be back home with my stupid husband, arguing about like heat stains on the furniture. I bet he loved hearing that. Who, Rob? I never told him. He thinks I fucking love Istanbul. [Chuckling] Hey, what's the word for... - Kaki. - Kaki? Oh, don't worry about it. Well, look at that. That's looking good. Yeah. How'd it go? Well, one bad knee and one shitty temperament. Oh, come on, man, come on But the third one could work. You just gotta make a f... Yeah? Yeah. Yes? Yeah, I mean she's... she's, you know, she's gentle... - Seriously? - And she's in pretty good shape. We got a horse, we got a horse, we got a horse! Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's not celebrate yet. We still gotta hammer out the details. We got a horse! DAVID: Tom? [♪♪♪] Tom? DAVID: Hey, you. Hi. DAVID: What are you doin'? I finally figured out how to connect my phone to the speakers. [Tom grunts] Tom? What bottle is that? It's actually the year that we met. Okay. And that's cool, but let's please just maybe not touch those. Look, you've been really great in helping me stay put for a while, so I thought maybe I could help you out with some of your attachments. You've got a horse, let's just celebrate. Yeah? Please don't open that. I knew this wouldn't be easy for you. - Just... just don't. - Trust me. Alright, hey! I'm saving it, please. [Grunts] See? What the fuck did I just say? Okay, just relax. Relax? Do you know you can't close that again? I do, because I'm not an idiot. ♪ Is it a crime... ♪ Do you realize that's an entire year of a great artist's life? It's more like an old bottle of wine that some dude was saving for a special day that never came. All the work that you've ever done in your entire life doesn't add up to what it takes to make one of those. ♪ Dreaming of you ♪ Yeah. Fine. Whatever. Maybe it wouldn't. But like, either way, what's the fucking point in all that fucking work if it was just gonna sit on a shelf collecting fucking dust? ♪ Guilty of dreaming of you ♪ Why did you come here, Tom? Because if it's just to fuck my life up again... ♪ What can I say ♪ ...I think you should go. ♪ After I've taken the blame ♪ ♪ You say you're through ♪ ♪ You'll go your way ♪ Sorry.

What are you doing? You're not leaving right now. It's like 10:30. Been in shitty neighborhoods, but I'm sure I'll be fine. Please come back down-stairs. You know, you never told me anything about how you felt back then. I know. You had my email, you could have reached out. I honestly didn't think you'd ever thought about me again. I just felt so stupid. DAVID: You didn't even leave a note and I... that whole thing mattered so much to me. And I didn't know if it had mattered at all to you. It mattered to me. Okay. Please come back down-stairs. There's somethin' I really wanna show you. [♪♪♪] What did you do? Just listen. David. - I know that this seems rash. - No, this isn't what I meant. Listen, I know. I didn't do this for you. I did this, because you're right. I stepped outside, and I took a breath of fresh air, and I realized, it was the old man who was saving these bottles, not me. And I thought about how he always imagined that he was gonna open 'em on some special occasion, but what if he was wrong, and what if opening them is the special occasion. And standin' out there, dude, I realized it's a fucking beautiful night. I'm serious. Go outside, the moon's out. It's beautiful. Yeah, we were just out there. DAVID: And? The moon is out and it's beautiful. It fuckin' is. DAVID: Are you with me on this? [Lyrics in French] You with me on this? You're not gonna make me drink alone, are you? [Lyrics in French] [♪♪♪] Well, this is the next youngest from his work, so it's just from 2000. [Lyrics in French] The year the Y2K bug was supposed to destroy all of society. [Lyrics in French] Well, don't... you... Don't you... don't just sniff it. You gotta really smell it, really take it in. [Lyrics in French] [sniffing] DAVID: Now take a sip. [Lyrics in French] What do you taste? Wet towel. DAVID Uh, you're drunk. No, I'm not even close to drunk. You try it. [Lyrics in French] [Gulping] Oh, fuck, that does taste like wet towel. Yeah, it's okay. We'll enjoy anyway. [David chuckling] Okay. Where were you in 2000? Mm, how old was I? I was like... I was in La Paz, I was skipping school, and playing street guitar for change, 'cause they just opened a McDonald's in Bolivia like two years earlier. And obviously, my dad wouldn't let us go anywhere near it. So I had to play Dylan for my Chicken McNugget money. [Lyrics in French] I think you're the one who's getting tipsy. [Lyrics in French] You couldn't have just opened a few of them? [Chuckles] I don't think that would have made my point. Yeah, but fuck, man, they'll only be good for like a day or two more, aren't they? [Lyrics in French] You think we need help? Hey. Hey. Hey buddy. Where's Em? Em crashed. I'll go get her. No. Okay. ROB: Wait, don't! Oof. [Indistinct speech] I'm callin' a family meeting. Hi! Hey. Are you down for a memorable night? What time is it? Who knows? Rob said that you wouldn't be, but I thought I would ask anyway. Okay, everybody's gotta pull their weight. Wait, how many bottles of wine is that? It's 10. It was 12. Oh, that's the old man special... Yep. The special. And we get two, maybe three days to drink all of it. That's the special collection. That's the special collection for special times. Well, I figured tonight was as special as any. Yeah, so going from the newest to oldest, which means we're currently on... 1998. Yeah. [Sighing] What are you sayin', man? Here's to a clean slate. [Lyrics in French] And you got a record player down here? Oh, shit. Yeah. Oh, that's great. [Chuckling] That's so great. Clean slate? Clean slate. Alright. Let's celebrate. [Chuckling] Um... Oh my God. Alright, let's uh, let's celebrate to a... To a... to finding a new steed. Yep. And to a mighty fine next vintage! Santé. [Indistinct chatter] The lady said she's payin'. [Indistinct chatter] Our world won't end in a bang but with the calculated beeps and clicks of our own DNA becoming data. Wait, that's not what she said. I think it actually was. No, she wasn't talking about the matrix! [Chuckling] What was she saying? I wanna hear your version. Um... [music begins] I've been reading the most interesting articles, lately. Do you realize, perhaps not your children, but your children's children will probably be born in test tubes? THE QUEEN: It just seems to make more sense. What does that mean for relationships between men and women? Biologists define the difference between a man and a woman by the sex cells they're born with. That's beautifully eloquent, really. But if you take sex for conception out of the picture, what different sort of identity sorting we'd be dealing with? I think freedom is the best option, right? But then again, freedom has to change. Doesn't it? Alright. Who wants the last of '95? Mm. Mm, it's kind of... feels like we're time-traveling, doesn't it? Yeah. Do you know what we were doing in '95, baby Davy? [Chuckles] I dunno. I was like what, 9? So I was in the basement Playin' Rum, Gins and Krakens. [Chuckling] What the... What do you mean? What? Do you mean Dungeons and Dragons? Yeah, but we made up a nautical version. Whoa! He wanted to be a ship captain when he grew up. He tried to get us all to call him "Captain Dave". - Oh, Captain Dave. - TOM: Are you kidding me? Yeah, I thought it would've been cozy to sleep in a cabin with bunk beds and all your friends are always around. ROB: Oh. Oh my God, I wanted to be an actress. I was 15. Jesus, it was like before life! But you're still so hot. Ew, that is not right. [Chuckles] ROB: I would've been 16. You're really bad at math. No, all I'm saying is that if I knew that this hotness existed back then, I'd totally would've been jerkin' off to you in the boys' bathroom during Mr. Nicolucci's geography class. You're nauseating. Nicolucci! Nicolucci! Nicolucci! [Laughing] I know! How can you have married it? The thing from a Thousand Leagues. I'm pretty sure you begged me. That's true. Actually, that's just uh... That's technically true. 100% true. But who's... yeah, when it's the one, it's the one. Do you believe in that that there's like one person for everyone? No. No, I don't think that. I don't think that at all. I think uh... We were... uh, it was my first Valentine's Day. It was our first Valentine's Day and I'd never done anything like that before I'd never... The ritual of it, you know? So I just leaned into the whole romance thing hard. I did everything. No stone unturned. I did the... the bubble bath and the... and the uh... And the flowers, and the rose petals, and the incense sticks, and the yoga music or whatever that was. And she comes in, she sees this and it's just... [Laughing] No expression, no reaction at all. And I was like, "Oh, fuck. She fuckin' hates Valentine's Day!" ROB: Or she did... or one of these things is wrong. Like those aren't bubbles or I don't know, like whatever. [Laughing] I was really super nervous, really, really nervous. I wanted it to go well. And now she's in the bathtub, and I'm leanin' up against the counter, and she's playin' with the bubbles and... And then all of a sudden, she just... I don't know where... She just looks up at me and she says, "This is one of those moments that I am going to remember right before I die." You know? Like she just decided it. And I just... I fuckin' knew. [Chuckles] I just knew. So, yeah, I don't believe in the one for everyone, but I believe in the one for me. What are you doing? Oh. [Kissing] Oh. [Kissing] Oh boy. [Kissing] - Mm. - Oh. My brother's here. [Kissing] [Chuckling] My brother's here. [Kissing] Okay, guys, I think I better put him down. Yeah, you better do that. [Grunting] [Chuckling] Come on, let's go. Right. Going. Yeah. We're goin', we're gonna go down f... on each other. [Chuckling] Nice. This was such a good idea. Yeah. This was such a good idea. Clearin' out the old man's work, g'ttin' ready for yours, for your... your vintage. This year's, next year's, year after that. Alright, honey. Alright, alright. [Chuckling] Captain Dave. Yeah, right. Alright. Alrighty. Alrighty. Don't stay up too late, we got... [Tom chuckling] We got shit to hammer out tomorrow. Yeah? Yeah. ROB: Love you. Love you, man. Have fun, you two. ROB: Alright. Bye y'all. EM: Goodnight, you two. Night. Day in the life, 1994. 1994, I was in... Oh, I was in North Dakota. Mmhmm. Oh, yeah, I was in North Dakota and... [Tom sighs] Carly Trumbull's mum was the first in our friend group to get one of those like um, do you remember the old car phones? The really big ones, yeah. Big ones, yeah. - Curly cord and all? - Uh-huh. So I guess she was fiddling with that or something and uh, she went to make a left turn, she wasn't paying attention, and she got hit by a tractor trailer. Oh, shit. She didn't make it, obviously. No, she was fine. Carly was in the passenger seat. You know? Oh, fuck, what's the time? You've gotta go to your horse meeting. Hmm. [Gasps] Oh, damn, that's not good! Let me see. It's not good. I'm sorry. David! [Chuckles] That's, first of all, electricity... [Kissing] [Lyrics in French] [Chuckling] Do you believe in fate? You mean like everything happens for a reason, that kind of shit? Yeah. Destiny? Nope. [Chuckling] I don't. I think it's bullshit. I think all that like fuckin' superstitions and like spiritual crap is so annoying, but also as a rule, I don't fuck with the universe. Oh, look, it's a Mourvèdre! Yeah, the last one was, too. Really? Do you remember the bottle that we had after Muddy's had a map like this on it? We played that point-and-go game. You know, the one where I point and we go? [Lyrics in French] Yeah, I remember. [Lyrics in French] I have a problem. [music ends] Could you help me? Yeah, but this is the last of the night, too. Okay. You have to enjoy. Mmhmm. [Slurping] DAVID: The old man commissioned that. It's called "the first owner". I started out thinking it was so romantic, you know? Workin' out here with your hands and plantin' roots down deep, never digging 'em up. Yeah. I guess that's one way to do life. He's so tired. [Chuckling] I mean... No, I think he looks like he could be happy. Alright. Fuck it. We're doin' it. What? Close your eyes. Oh, okay. Alright, wherever your finger lands, we're goin' there tomorrow. Alright. Wait. No. Today tomorrow or tomorrow tomorrow? Um, I think that I meant... [Kissing] Whenever we wake up tomorrow. Okay. Okay? So tomorrow tomorrow, today tomorrow. [Chuckling] Oh. Fuck! [Laughing] Uh, I think you pointed to like the middle of the Sahara. Perfect. So it's better if you hit the bottle. Okay. Get him. Well, that's the middle of the sea! It's close enough. [Chuckling] Actually, I know where that is. The sun's coming up. Oh, yeah? Oh-oh. Wooh! [♪♪♪] Hi. Morning. Hey, what time is it? It's like 2:30. [Kissing] Oh. You're ready? For what? We're going' down south today, remember? But didn't they go? [Slurping] Yeah, they went. So, they've got the only car? The only car, yeah.

Yeah. Alright. You're fucking with me. I'm not fucking with you. You're sucH an asshole. I'm not fucking with you. [Grunting] [Conversation in French] Well? The carb. Oh, how much? 350. which she says is a deal because she happens to have a used one that will work. Fuck! DAVID: Yeah. Okay, well, I've got like 10 euros to my name and I didn't even bring my wallet.

Yeah, I think my preteen-self was onto somethin', yeah. You ever have a day where you look back, you realize you wouldn't change a single thing if you could? DAVID: I don't remember the last time I felt like that. Don't look at me like that. Like what? I'm your pixie dream girl or something. DAVID: Aren't you kinda, though? I'm exactly zero of those things. Oh, shit, bad. Well, there's gotta be a not-too expensive hotel room around here. We only have enough for the repair. Okay. That's okay. You comfortable? I'm good. Are you good? I'm good. What year? Hey! The year you were born. Oh, we're finally back to the beginning. Happy birthday to me. [Chuckling] Did you ever have that moment where you realized for like the first time that you're not a young person anymore? Yeah. I've been feelin' like that a lot in the last few years. Why? What do you think about when you feel that way? I've been realizing that like other people look at me and they don't see me as a kid anymore. I'm 30. I'm just... no, I'm older. I'm older than my dad was when he had me. Makes me think about how societies have rituals to decide when you're really young, though. Yeah. What do you think the closest thing we have to that now is? I don't know. Gettin' married, havin' a kid. God, what if you don't want either of those things? Makin' love on a beach in France. Blugh. Makin' love. Are you serious? Fuckin'. Whatever. [Laughing] Don't you think, huh? We're not doing this! What do you mean we're not doing it? 'Cause we're old enough to know that having sex on a beach is a really dumb fucking idea. - Uh, no, you're not old. - I am. - You're not that old. - I'm 30. [Chuckling] Get off. Hey. You awake? Mmhmm. When you were pregnant, whose was it? I mean, I know it wasn't ours. Right? Would it matter if it was? I'm just curious. It wasn't yours. Yeah. Obviously. Hey. He's in the study. It's a really great story, Em. You better go talk to him first. Okay. I don't care about the bike. The bike's the bike, bike's a toy. What are you doing? Why are you gonna give this up? I know you're not gonna understand. I'm tryin' to understand, man. This is me being very cool. Trying to understand. So you gotta help me. [Sighing] You remember last week when you asked me if I really thought it was a coincidence that she came on the same day that Gwen died. The day after. But yeah, what? I think you were right. I think it wasn't. This is gonna sound really stupid, but... ...I was at a crossroads ...and I think she was supposed to come. Oh, fuck, man. Don't... don't do that. The fate? It was divine intervention? She found you on Instagram. That's what happened. Fate is an algorithm Photoshopped by me to look like a cool choice. That's what this is. I can't help it, man. I'm sorry. I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to think about what you're doing, that you're giving up here. This is... this is beautiful. Look where you are! You're gonna give this up for... for... for her? You're gonna go run off with her? That's not you. This is you. You are a wine-maker. You are a maker of great wine. DAVID: What's the point? ROB: Why can't that be good enough? DAVID: What's the point? ROB: You started a business. You started something that... DAVID: What's the point in making wine if you don't make time to drink it? ROB: What the fuck are you talking about? That's all we've been doing since we got here. My wife is officially an alcoholic now. [Rob chuckles] DAVID: Nope. TOM: Yes. DAVID: No. Yes. It's not gonna... I'll tell you what? You hit that, I'll buy the whole next round. Okay. Okay? Fuck you! [Laughing] DAVID: Jesus! They make 'em all that tall where you're from? What? Your boyfriend. Oh, that's not my boyfriend. Well, he's a giant anyway. It's a good thing. Oh, okay, well, you should tell him that, maybe come out with him, 'cause he's really shy about talking to guys. Oh, him, too. Where you guys from? All over. Allover. Never heard of Allover.: I'll have to look it up next time I wanna meet some people who speak in vagaries. Yeah, you do that. Everything okay? Yeah. They botherin' you? Mm-mm. I don't think so. Hmm. But what's "bukkake"? - Hold that for a sec. - Mm, mm. Oh, wait, no, no, no, David, David, David! You piece of shit! Huh? [Grunting] Fuck you, man! [Grunting] [Sighing] [Blowing air] MADAME GÉRARD: Hi. Are you enjoying your stay? TOM: Yes, thank you. Tell me, what do you appreciate the most? The wine, I guess. MADAME GÉRARD: No, it's not it. No? MADAME GÉRARD: We have a saying. "One makes wine to appreciate it, but one drinks wine to appreciate everything else." Oh. Is this your father? Does he look that old? No, it's Fridriech. He was my husband. Oh! when did he pass? Passed? He's still alive, as far as I know. Thank you. He lived on a boat in Chile now. MADAME GÉRARD: He sails it every year, back and forth, back and forth. He was always quite romantic. Oh.. That's my father. Oh! So is that what the property used to look like? The property? No, it's not here. I arrived here much later. That must have been the Austrian cottage, yes. Where are you from? All over. All over. My father was a pilot you see, so we moved around a lot. So tell me why did you come here? Why does everybody keep asking me that? Oh, I was just curious. I don't want to be a repetitive. TOM: No, it's fine. It's... it's not um... Mm. I don't know. I went home for my dad's funeral this year. And it was the first time I'd seen him in two years. Everyone came, like the kids, and in-laws and their kids. I was standing on the um, family plot that we have and just covered in cigarette butts, and beer cans, and junk, I realized that if my dad hadn't had kids no one would be there. You know, except for the mortuary chapel dude and some of his insane cousins. So I don't know, I guess that has something to do with it. MADAME GÉRARD: Did I mention he called earlier, the young man? He's never called on the phone before. No, you didn't. Apparently, Tuesday will be our last lunch together. So are you gonna give me advice or something? Isn't that why you invited me here? No. I just wanted to have the chance to meet you properly. After hearing so much, you know? You never know what to expect. You must have known that from our very first lunch together. He would talk about the girl with the boy's name. No. I didn't. MADAME GÉRARD: I wish I have some advice for you now. Do you love him? Yeah. I mean... I definitely care about him more than I thought I'd ever care about a guy. And if someday I wanted to have a family, I guess he could be that. If? Someday? I know. MADAME GÉRARD: What can I tell you that you don't know? Whatever you decide, you will look on it many years from now, and you'll smile, and also you'll feel a profound sadness. Whatever you decide, it will be very happy and very sad. It's fucked. Yeah. [Chuckling] MADAME GÉRARD: I like this expression. It's fucked. There's nothing quite like it. What do they say after? Oh, pardon my French. Yeah. They do. So what made you decide to settle down? I didn't settle down, I just got married. I don't know. It happened. He took me sailing across the Atlantic on a boat we bought by selling all of our possession. It was the size of this room. MADAME GÉRARD: We made the same route that they used to make when they crossed in the old day for the New World, as they called it. That was very romantic. There's a region along the way in the subtropics where the sea becomes perfectly still. It's because, you see, there's two high-pressure winds on either side, and in the middle nothing. So there's nothing you can do and you're stuck there for days until you find a little current that you can hold onto that pulls you out of it. That was the best time we ever spent together. Nothing on the horizon, nothing to do but drink. Rum, I think it was. Or gin. No, a dark rum. Oh, shit. Why can't I remember? Will you take some fruit with you? I have too many. You know... Fucked-up face, you know? I'd say today was pretty fucking good. [Exhaling] Yeah? Wouldn't you? I'd say it was. Hey look, there's a little map on here. What is it? France or something? You're a real geographer. [Chuckling] [Sniffles] Okay, come here. What are you doing? - No, my hands are cold. - Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And then where ever you point, that's where we're gonna go. You ready? Come on. You're fucked up. You know, that you're the one that's fucked up. Close your eyes. [Sighs] Alright. You ready? Pow! You idiot Oh, fuck. [Laughing] DAVID: I'm sorry. I got really excited. No, I'm not doing it again. David, stop. I said we're gonna go where you pointed. You pointed right at Domaine Ginies. Mmhmm. Or at Chateau Piegon. So that's where we're going. Just one more bottle from the collection and it's mine. So... No. What? I just don't need any, that's all. Okay. Santé. You make really great wine, David. DAVID: What time is it? Still early. See you soon. [Kissing] RAILWAY STATION ANNOUNCER: The next train is on platform six. It's the 1651 service to Pearse station, Dublin. Office tower at the Pearse station, Dublin. [Indistinct chatter] Hey. Hi. Uh, I just wanted to say to you that um... I just wanna... I don't... In case, you think that um... Yeah? Just that none of this is about you. I know. Okay. Do you wanna share a smoke on the wall or something? I'm all out, sorry. Oh, shit. We should have got some in town. Yeah. Maybe next time. Yeah. Well, good night then? Good night. [♪♪♪] TOM (VO): I know.
