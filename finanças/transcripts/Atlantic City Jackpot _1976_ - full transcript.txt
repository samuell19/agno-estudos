MAN [ON RADIO]: Hi, I'm a loafer. I don't like to work at all. I'd much rather loaf than work. Wouldn't you? I like to fool away the time, goof off, put my feet up, and take it easy. It's my time, isn't it? And I waste it if I want. Now, the reason I lie in bed till noon is I'm a rich man. You may wonder how a loafer like me got to be rich. Well, I didn't inherit money. My father was a small town preacher. He never made much and gave away what he did make. I don't gamble, and I don't steal, and I didn't marry any rich girl. But I found a way to work just a few hours a day and make a fortune. You could too, buy sending me $5.98 for my book, "The Poor Man's Guide to Easy Living and Instant Wealth." By following the principles of my book, you could be sitting right now by the pool of some fancy hotel. You could put steak on your table instead of pork and beans. You could have the things you want, do the things you want to do, travel, live it up, drive a Cadillac convertible, or if you're like me, maybe you just want to sit back, relax, and watch the grass grow. You can do it. Send me $5.98 today care of this radio station. It'll be the best investment you ever make, better than stocks and bonds, better than watching that old devil inflation eat away at the money in your project. And if you're not satisfied, if you don't learn how to live easy and make money fast, I'll be glad to send you your money back. But keep the book anyway. I can afford it. It only cost me $0.20 to print up. But it's worth thousands, maybe millions. You and your family will thank me for it.

The air quality is-- [bells chiming] WOMAN: Good morning, Mr. Banks. Jim. Richard, how are you? Sit down. [QUIETLY] Somebody's here. Tell him I'll get back to him. Well, how'd you make out with that fellow you told me about? Not too well. I saw him yesterday, and he wasn't interested. But I did get some money from another source. Good. Enough to cover the month? Well, just about. I have 200,000. Well, that's certainly something. If we apply the 200,000 to this note that's due now, they should cancel the foreclosure and not bother you again until you've got everything ready. If you had a check with you, we could put it through right now. That will certainly make them happier with you upstairs, Richard. Well, I certainly hope so. What I have here are some savings accounts and some bonds. They're all in my wife's name. All the withdrawal slips are signed and the bonds are all endorsed. Oh, you got it from your wife? Well, she has a big interest in the project. And I sort of convinced her she ought to protect it. JIM: Good for you. Well, it all looks all right to me. Here, just fill this out to renew the other notes, and you should be fine. Could I get about $25,000 of this in cash, do you think, Jim? In other words, you only want to put down 175,000. I'd rather have it all, Dick. Well, I need about 15,000 to finish things up at the site, and I could use the other 10 personally. I could sign another note for the 25,000. JIM: I don't think they'll take another note, Dick. Why don't you try to limp by on what you've got and let me give them the whole 200,000? You're a pretty resourceful fellow, Richard. You can come up with 25,000 somewhere, I'm sure. No, I can't. I'm pretty far out over the edge as it is. I can tell you it was not an easy matter coming up with this money. It was really just luck, actually. JIM: Can you do with 10,000? That way I could give them 190,000. It sounds almost like 200. If that's the best you can do, OK. JIM: Here, let's take one of these books to a teller. This one in trust for your daughter has about 10,000. Thanks, Jim. My pleasure. I'm glad everything turned out all right. Me too. Could you make out a check for this? Make it cash, please-- fifties and twenties. That's a lot of bills. Put it in a bag for him, will you? Well, I'll put everything into work right away. I'll call you this afternoon, just to verify that everything's OK. But don't worry. There won't be any problem. I'm sure. Thanks a lot, Jim. JIM: Hey, how are the kids? You have two, don't you? That's right-- a boy and a girl. They're just fine. Glad to hear it. Well, here's your money. Jim, thanks again. Whee! [laughing] Now, look, you kids just sit still, because Daddy is going to be with you in about five minutes. Daddy! [inaudible] MAN [ON INTERCOM]: --a black button. And you can save money if you get one right now. It's a bargain at our [inaudible] prices. But it's a real steal at our sale price of just $19.99. Imagine [inaudible]. Excuse me, sir. [inaudible] Oh, uh, uh, yeah, I've never been here before [inaudible] It's quite all right. Just put the dime right in there, sir. MAN [ON INTERCOM]: In honor of still another member of the famous [inaudible] family, Mr. [inaudible] we present the graffiti mug. Wouldn't it be great to have a miniature oil lamp hanging in your room? They look absolutely far out, and they really work too. You can fill them-- May I help you, sir? I'm passing through. MAN [ON INTERCOM]: The regular price is $5, but the sale price right now is just $2.99. [inaudible] See something you like. MAN [ON INTERCOM]: It comes in white or red. [honking] Morning. Morning. You the maid? Yeah, I am. Who are you? My name's Lucy. I babysit here. Miss Bank's upstairs asleep. Oh. We were up all night. Where are the children? Um, Mr. Banks has them. I mean, uh, he's picking them up now. Why, you want to make them lunch or something? No, was just wondering. Oh, Mr. Banks should be back any minute. Do you know what time it is? 11 o'clock. Guess I better get to work. Where's Mr. Bank picking up the children, their grandmother's house? I don't know. I guess so. He should be back any minute. I'm going to wake up Mrs. Banks. Why? Why you want to wake her up? She has to pay you? I'll give you the money. She can pay me back. No need to disturb her. Well, I think she'll want to be up when the children are here. Why? What for? Because my boyfriend kidnapped them. That's why. He tied me up, and he took the children away. They call the police? No, they were afraid to call the police. I mean, they didn't want to get the police involved. So Mr. Banks went with the money early this morning. He should be back by now. Well,he isn't. Now, where did your boyfriend take these children? Come on. I don't know. You don't know? He didn't tell you anything about it? Where are the children, girl? I don't know. He tied me up. Where did Mr. Banks get the money? I think Mrs. Banks gave it to him. Look, don't ask me anymore. I gotta go to work. You won't tell anybody, will you? No, girl. Don't forget. You stay here. I'm going to go and wake up Mrs. Banks. ROLAND: Park over there. You got to be kidding me, man. Take the money, Roland. Fuck you. Oh, you think you're a big operator, right? Trying to buy me off with 10 grand? Fuck your 10 grand. I'll explain it again, Roland. You just take this money, and you disappear. Get away from me, buddy. I don't want that money. No one will come after you. And that is a promise. Yeah, a promise, right. Look. Just tell me where the children are, Roland, and then you can get off. You'll be free. Look, I'm tired of telling you, man. I want it all. Eat something, Mrs. Banks. No, no, I will later. [dog barking] Where are they? They'll be here soon. Shit. Goddamned fucking machine. Listen, mister, I need that 200 grand. I had this thing all figured out, man. And I need all of that money. God damn it, now I need that money. I wouldn't hurt your kids, man. I just need the money. Why? Because I'm tired of scrounging, man. I'm tired of scrounging my whole life. I know what you mean, Roland. [LAUGHING] That's no lie, Roland. That damned money. When you have it, somebody's always trying to take it away from you. You know, you have to keep protecting it. Funny thing is, deep down, you really should feel guilty about having it. So when someone really wants your money, he can get it. See, you want to give it away, because deep down you feel uncomfortable having it. I don't know. I guess you want to be even with everybody else. Why don't you take the Cadillac too? Take the money. Leave me here. By the time I walk back up to the road, you're long gone. Take the money. You got to sign over the registration too. Take off your watch. What? The gold watch. I've been noticing it. I want it. My watch. What about my kids? I told you not to worry, man. What about my kids, Roland? I want to get the car started first. I want to make sure there are no double crosses. They're at the shopping mall. They're in the parking lot at the shopping mall. You rode right past them, you dumb bastard. They're in a blue VW, man. They're locked up. You got my kids in a locked car? You son of a bitch. Hey, hey, hey they're fine. They're fine. A blue VW-- you can drive it home. Is that a car? It's OK. They're OK. Where are the children, Richard? They're-- Where are the children? They're safe, honey. They're all right. Where are they? I took them to the hospital. He had them in a locked car. I don't believe you. They're OK. I'm telling you. They're OK. We'll go see them right now. Go get the keys to your car. Honey, he took my car. We'll got to the hospital right now. I'm going to call the hospital, and if they're not there, I am calling the police. Ellen. Howard was right. We should have called the police. This is all your fault. God damn it, go do whatever the hell you want. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. Mr. Banks? What the hell do you want? Where's Roland? And how should I know? He didn't hurt the children. He left them in a locked car in this god damn heat! He just wanted the money. That's all. It's all right. They're OK. Here's the keys to your car. Go move it so we can get out. Oh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Banks. I'm sorry for everything. It's all right. It's all right, Lucy. It wasn't your fault. Well, what about Roland. Are you going to call the police? What's the point? What about the money? I don't care. Guess I better move my car. [car starting] See, they're fine? Hi, Mommy. What's that bandage? Oh, it's nothing serious. As far as I can figure out, she was playing with the cigarette lighter in the car, and she's got a little burn on her lip. It's not bad. Mommy. Hi, honey, you feel all right? We were locked in a car, mom. Everything's going to be all right. Don't you worry about anything. [children playing] Yes, sir? Hey, how you doing? Good. I'd like a room-- a big one, by the week. All right, just sign. Hey, look, I got this Caddy outside. You got a bellhop? Of course. 804. 95 [inaudible] WOMAN [ON RADIO]: Why not come over right now. You should see what's happening in the game room. Here you go. Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Holy shit, [inaudible] You'd never get a job where I come from. Look, I got this Caddy outside. I want you to take it to some indoor garage. you tell the guys there to wash it up real good. And you tell them to stow it someplace so they don't have to move it around. See, I won't be needing it for awhile. Yes, sir. And bring the ticket get back to me and you give them this $10 bill. Yes, sir. Keys? Thank you. Hey, make sure you give them the whole 10.
