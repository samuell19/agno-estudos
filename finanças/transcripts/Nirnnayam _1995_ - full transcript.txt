What happened? - Something wrong with my bicycle. Nirnayam (The Decision) l normally don't get drunk. But today l had one too many. l can't drive anymore. l'll let Vasudev drive. l might ram this car into something. Get up. You hold the steering What's the colour of traffic signal? ls it red, green or yellow? lt looks like black to me. You go ahead. Hey stop. lt's red. Stop the car. Who is it? Someone came and banged into our car. lt's not a he. lt's a she! She's looks beautiful. - She's coming over. Try English, so we can understand. ls this the way you drive? - Now we understood what you said. l'll explain it you. Please step back. What is the need for yellow? Yellow is the problem. You come with me. Take a look at my car. You go. - You go ahead. l'll follow you. Don't act smart. You banged into our car. And now you're blaming us for this mess. Two cases of beer. - We shared between us. Give it to me in writing. l'm the Deputy Commissioner of Police. Why complain for such things? This beautiful car of yours kissed this beautiful car of my friend. You can leave only after the police arrive. Compensation? Here's two rupees. Let her wait for the police and take compensation... l'll drag you to the court. You may do that. But your car is right behind our car. So it's your car that came and banged into ours. Don't say that. Our car's ahead of her car. lsn't it? So it's her car that is at fault. You don't have to say that. We have just escaped from jail. lt's your car that came and banged into our car. So they've arrived! l'm coming. So you've come. - Can't you see? You're drunk today also. - Yes, as usual. My God. When will he change? One should not take more than six drinks. Or he would be like you. l removed it when l went to sleep. Even l was sleeping while driving. Yet my clothes are in place. Don't you provoke me. Or else... Don't do that. Please hold me. l agree that l jumped the signal. But it was she who banged into my car. Who was she? - l don't know. Oh God. lf a girl bangs into his car, l'll have to leave this place. How can you sleep without your clothes on? Mother, aren't you happy? l've come back here after my studies. l'll join our hospital and look after you. l'll be with you now. Take your medicines. Open your mouth. lt's breakfast time for Uncle. l'll be back. When you were in America there was no specific time for my meals. That's because you didn't get married at the right time, uncle. How could l? After your father's death l had to take all the responsibilities. l'm there to look after mother now. Should l find a proposal for you? Take charge of the post of MD in the hospital. Then we'll think over it. No. l can't. Uncle should look after everything. l've informed Dr. Roy about your joining the hospital. He's the best cardio surgeon in the whole of South lndia. You might learn something if you work under him. ls he that smart? He won't be smarter than surgeons in America. That may true. But the appointment is at 10.30 a.m. l'll go. But before that l need to go to the R.T.O. office. My car's bumper got smashed because of a drunkard. l've noted down the number. Annie hasn't forgotten me? - No. Dr. David told me about you joining. Anyway, all the best. So you've come to take compensation. Would you like cheque or cash? You still have doubts? - Yes. l checked the library too. The book is lying on the shelf. You can use the stool. How much was the amount, you said? - No, my Uncle... Why involve him for such petty things? So who is your Uncle? - You don't know who my uncle is? ls he an MP or a Minister? l don't care. You got the lab report in the morning and you found time now to inform me. You don't know the value of time. So who is your Uncle? - l'm David Kurushingal's... Gold medal in surgery from States. You want to gain experience from me. Dr. Annie? lsn't it? You should've told me this earlier. l've come here to join. A surgeon should be punctual first. l've got an appointment at 10.50. A surgeon does not have excuses. What does he think of himself? ls your duty over? - Yeah, l had a night shift. lt's good to have night shifts sometimes. lt's makes you slim. When is your day duty? - The day after tomorrow. That's my day off. When you have a night shift, l've day-duty... and when you've day duty, l'm off duty. So when do we meet after we are through with our duties? So you started romancing with the nurses in the morning itself? l was applying ointment on her. She has a skin disease. l know everything. l've been waiting for you without any reason. You might marry her one day. - What are you talking about? lf l could wait till your four sisters to get married... can't l wait for your two sisters to get married. l'll marry only you and nobody else. - Are you saying the truth? You won't talk to the nurse anymore. - That's all. l swear on you... never to set eyes on her again. We'll meet in the canteen. l've ordered curd rice for you. lt's better to shave off your head rather than wait for her. Oh Lord. Did you call me? - No. lt's wrong on your part not to allow Dr.David's niece to join... only because she was ten minutes late. - There's nothing wrong with that. When you fix an appointment, you should be on time. lyer. Haven't you started? Hey, come fast. You're a lazy bum. You carry on. l need to have some research papers ready. Atleast in my second life, l would love to become like him. You didn't have any rights to teach discipline to that girl. You fool. - Not fool. l'm V.D. lyer. You can just prescribe an ointment for skin disease... but we surgeons need discipline. - That's why this V.D. lyer after... after an M.B.B.S., took a degree in skin diseases. lsn't the car ready? Uncle, l'm in a hurry. Forgive me. Today's girls! Even the boys are the same. Get me some coffee. l was here at 8.30 a.m. sharp. What does he think of himself? Punctuality and precision are not only the qualities of a surgeon. Don't you take a bath in the morning? My car broke down so l had to come running. lt's good to run. Sign these papers and join me in my rounds... but only after you get fresh. Her mother died. lt's an accident case. No great hope. Are you related to this kid? - No. We brought her here when... we found her lying on the road. Nurse, bandage the wounds. And you guys come with me. This is an emergency operation case. But this hospital does not take... accident cases. You may take her to a government hospital. But that hospital is far away. lsn't it risky to take the kid? Are you ready to take the blame if anything happens to the kid? They are not taking up an accident case. lf she's critical, isn't it your duty to attend to her? lf the death toll rises then the hospital loses it's glamour... and moreover the court cases. - lt is a Medical Legal case... What Medical Legal Case? At the cost of the life of this little girl? Step aside. Doctor, that accident case? - She's been operated upon... That's not the case. Her mother died. An FlR... You people come only after everything is over. l'll sign the papers. - Can we leave, sir? Why're you in a hurry? There's still lot of formalities to be done. Who knows you must have committed the accident and brought her here. You blame those who bring accident victims to the hospitals. That's the reason why people are scared to help such victims. Don't pull them up in this case. Or they might lose faith in humanity. What does he think of himself? Take up medical legal cases... abuse other doctors publicly and teach the cops their duty. And insulting me inspite of knowing that l'm the M.D.'s niece. l knew all this when l sent you to assist him. He's the best surgeon. That's why we have kept him. - There's no need to keep him. You learn everything from him. Then we'll think of a replacement. She's conscious, but she is asleep. - Any relatives? There was no one to claim her mother's dead body. When we enquired, we got to know that she doesn't have anyone. Consider her as my patient and transfer her bills to my account. Shift her to the ward later on. l'll come and see her there. What is this, dear? She's not taking the medicines. - Let me try. Smart girl. What's your name? - Parvati. Nice name. l'll call you as Paru Kutty. My mom also calls me by that name. Doctor Uncle, l want to see my mom. Your mother had come. But you were asleep. She's just left. She'll be back in the morning with the medicines. No. l want to see her right now. Don't cry. We are all there to take care of you. This nurse-aunty and doctor-aunty will also take care of you. You go to sleep. l'll come and see you regularly. Tell my mother she shouldn't leave without seeing me. Sure. But that's the duty of nurses. - What ? By reading some books... Dr. Annie, be with her. lnform me if there is an emergency. and by operating dead people, anyone can get a degree. But to serve a living human being is the biggest service. Only then will God bless you to serve the patients. lf you love your patient then only can you become a good doctor. You people attend to the patients like a mechanic does to his vehicles. You go for your rounds. l'll join you later. Nurse's duty. Stupid! lf this goes on, you'll be in trouble. You can't adopt all the kids. lnstead of that, find a good girl for yourself and settle down in life. After mother's death she's all alone. - For those kids l'm running this... institution. Give the kid to me. l'll look after her. No father. God has sent the kid to me. l'll myself look after her. Years ago, when l was on my morning walk... l saw a little kid crying out for his mother under a tree. The tiny tot grew up to become a famous doctor. l'm happy. l'm happier because he's a good samaritan too. l was going to see you soon. My right leg is paining badly. l took some ayurvedic medicines but it's of no use. The doctor says it's... because of low blood circulation. - You should stop this cigar... and you should also control your diet. - What else can a priest do? Except eating good food and smoking cigars. But you smoke a lot. You come to the hospital for a check-up. No. l won't come there. You'll give me an injection. Kids! All come here. Take this and distribute it to everyone. From today you should remember one more person while you pray. l know. Without forgetting, l'll pray for Paru Kutty also. Now for the compensation to the badminton player, Rajshekhar. Even if he is paralysed because of an overdose of anesthesia... we'll have to cover up the case. And to consider it a case of... medical negligence and pay whatever they demand,is foolishness. So the board has decided not pay any compensation. Where are you going? - They've given me discharge. They gave us a bill even though they didn't gave us any compensation. Amounting to rupees 70000. He should've atleast walked on his own even if he's not able to play. ln this condition, how can l alone look after him? lf a patient is paralysed due to overdose of anesthesia... it is the mistake of the doctor and he should take the blame. Dr. Rajiv, can you say that it's not your mistake? Dr. Roy, you might also make a mistake someday. lf we commit any mistake, we doctors should all stand united. This the question of the prestige of our hospital, too. Dr. Roy, you better sit down. - Don't make me sit down. Do you expect me to be with you all in this? lt was just a mistake for you. But he has lost his sporting career. And what about his wife? Even her life is spoiled. We made a mistake and that man is now bedridden with paralysis. And the board is not ready to pay any compensation for the mistake. And we also hand over a bill of 70000 to the patient. ls this justice? We've spent more than 5 crores to get the latest equipments. We've the best equipments compared to other hospitals in South lndia. And we have to cover the cost of it. And to cover the cost ECG, scanning and MRl even for small diseases. To make money, you fleece the poor patients who come to the hospital. The money-lenders who give money on interest are better than us, doctor. Dr. Roy, we should also support the management and think about... the profits for the hospital. For you, it's a business because you have got the degree with money. For me it's not a business because l've worked hard for it. For me, my profession is a service for my patients. lf you want to serve the patients, then join some government hospital. l've come here after seeing some doctors who work in the... government hospital in the day time and fleece the poor patients... in the evening in private clinics. l came here to tell you something. The board has decided to pay compensation to the badminton player. lt was possible only because of you. But you are getting little over. lf l speak the truth, you may feel that l'm going overboard. l'm a doctor and l have sympathies for my patients. l can't resist... fighting with those who don't have any sympathy towards them. You may fight for them. But don't be so harsh. lsn't your name Paru Kutty? - No. lt's Parvati. Only doctor uncle has the right to call me Paru Kutty. Are you angry with your aunty? - Aren't you sitting here forcibly. l know. l overheard when Doctor uncle was scolding you. Who told you that l don't like you? lnitially l felt you're a bad girl. Later on l came to know that you are a smart and good girl. But now l like you very much. - Now you can call me Paru Kutty. And you can call me Annie aunty. Take a deep breath. Paru Kutty, go to sleep. l'll be back soon. l came to know of an important problem in Paru Kutty's case which you missed. When the medical technology is so advanced today... Only by checking the pulse and counting the heartbeats... a patient was cured in this country. lt is still famous for that. There was no need for ECG and city scans earlier to ascertain the disease. What's wrong with some tests to confirm the diagnosis? Who told you to take all the tests without consulting me? There is no need for all these tests. ln this profession you don't have... to read all the books. You should learn by experience. And you still haven't learnt by experience. A doctor need not to do all the tests to diagonise a patient. You're only trying to show off what you've learnt in the States. No, Doctor. Her heart... That kid is living with a heart which can stop anyday. Under these circumstances, operation is not a treatment but an experiment. What happened, Paru Kutty? - Why did you lie to me? l won't talk to you. - What's the matter? l know that my mother died in the accident. She won't come back now. Why did you tell a lie to me? - Don't cry. l knew that you would cry if l told you the truth. And l don't like you crying. - l don't have anyone Uncle. Who told you that you don't have anyone? l'm there for you. Even l don't have anyone of my own. Let's go out. We'll go for a drive. We'll buy some ice-cream and good dresses for you. Annie, you? At this hour? - You told me to take care of her. She's asleep. Doctor, about the test l've done... - lt's all right. lf l've been harsh with you, please forgive me. Oh it was you. Praise be to the Lord. Hasn't he got up? - He did. Then where is he? - He went to sleep again. l've come to know about his late comings. You should be blamed for it. Why did l gave you a job here? Don't hold my ear. What is this? - What is it? Do you smoke through the nose? - How did this come here? l'll thrash him today. Get a cup of tea? Was it you father? How come, so early in the morning? - Should l get the tea? l did all the tests, as you said. They have suggested an operation. Check this out and see if it can be avoided. An operation is necessary. lt would be better if you could cure with some capsules. Look, l'll stop smoking cigars and also control my diet. There is no need to worry. lt's a simple operation. lt is to increase the blood circulation in your leg. Can't that be avoided? - No. lf that's the wish of the Lord... Your assistant Annie... - Annie? Which Annie? Daughter of Queen Elizabeth! Get lost from here. She had come to the church yesterday. - What for? To pray for Paru Kutty? - Father, l'll have a bath soon. Come to the hospital with me. l'll admit you today itself. Can't you avoid the operation? - No way, father. He might say anything. But an operation is very painful. Have you been operated upon? - No. But l've heard about it. We have a patient whose tissue matches with that of the minister. Dr. Marcos here. Post the operation of the priest for Monday at the operation theatre no.5. Dr. Roy might also join the operation. Dr. Roy is coming. What is it doctor? - He's my personal patient. lf you don't mind, can l stand here? l'm here father. This is the money which the minister had promised for the operation. This is not the next patient. lt is sex patient. What's the matter Devki Rani? l've got a red patch on my thighs. - lt's your skin. There can be red patches. - You should see it, doctor. There's no need. l'll prescribe some ointment. Just apply it. Doctor, without looking at it... - There's no need for that. l know the disease. There's something in my eyes. ls there something in your eyes? Let me see it. Devika Rani had some problems. l fell down with her. l'm totally innocent. What is this? - This. lt's a skin allergy. l came to know of this because l had to attend to a delivery case. l know you're going to marry her. l know l'm not beautiful. Do l look aged because l'm fat? - Your beauty is in your fatness. lsn't the elephant fat and beautiful? l swear that l'll marry you. l swear it on my grand parents. We'll meet in the canteen. We can both have curd rice. Mix some poison also in the curd rice. lt will be painful for me. - Like an ant-bite. That's all. Which ant? - Not the red one. A small one. l'll give you a gift if you don't cry while l give you this injection. Give her oxygen soon. l'll call the doctor. l don't have any problems as such. - You'll be all right soon. Doctor, Paru Kutty is gasping. Why did you not switch on the generators when the lights went off? l'll lose my job if l tell you. - lf you don't tell me l'll kill you. lf it's professional competition then you should show your calibre in the... operation theatre. And not while operating a kid by... switching off the lights. A bastard like you can only do this. lf anything happens to the kid, l'll finish you off. l'll tear you apart. - People outside... Sit properly. There are many patients waiting see a hopeless butcher. Don't worry. l'm here. Does it hurt? l'll give you a sleeping pill. You'll be all right. Frankly, l was under the impression that l've learnt everything. But today l've realised that there is still a lot to learn. For a moment, l thought that l lost everything when the lights went off. But your presence of mind and strength helped me a lot. Paru Kutty is everything for me in life. She doesn't have anyone else. At this moment of joy and sorrow l feel that there should be somebody with me. You're lucky to have Paru Kutty. Lady luck may smile on you one day. What did she say? Was it in reference to Paru Kutty or... How can l call her? - Should l call him? What do l say to her? - Couldn't he get what l said? Or is he acting innocent? - You didn't say anything clearly. He's not going kill me over the phone. l'll call him up. She can call me up, too. - Here l come. No, it's a wrong number. l'm waiting for some other call. ln today's times, the girl should take the first step. l'll tell him that l like him. What is he going to do? Sir, this is Annie here. - What is it Annie? What happened to her? Tell me what happened. l had called the hospital. She's all right. Even l had called up the hospital. She is all right. l wanted to tell you something. - What is it? Go ahead and tell me. There's someone at the door. Please hold on. Did you cut off the line? Who told you to disconnect the phone? l was saying something very important. lt was about life and death. But it was a call from the hospital. Even the doctors have matters related to life and death. This is not a question of life and death. Don't get angry. How do you know that? - l know it. Now let him call me up. Let him take the initiative now. When did this all start? - Since the last few days. The disease is not acute so let's cure it when it is chronic. Prescribe some medicine for me? - Give me a peg and l'll tell you. How did you propose to Dr. Subba? When we were kids l used to give her toffees and peanuts. Then during higher studies, l used to feed her with halvas and ladoos. Like this. Nothing. l just had a pain in my heart. The heart beat is normal. - lt's not possible. Check again. Didn't you hear a murmur after the second beat? Murmur? - Haven't you heard it before? Haven't you read about it in the books written in the early century? The murmur about the day Adam met Eve. The murmur of love. Doctor, what is a murmur? lt is to be learnt during post-graduatation. How is the murmur now? - l'm feeling better. This is not a murmer. lt's arthritis. Romantic arthritis. This disease has a problem. lt's contagious. Even the doctor could get infected by this. Can l cure you? - Sure. But l need a intensive... l mean, l need intimate care. Then only will l be cured. Did you know it father? - What is it, daughter? There's a line between them? - Line? Yes. Between Doctor uncle and aunty. Everyone here knows about it. What does this line mean? - Father doesn't know anything. Line means 'l Love You'. - Naughty girl. You talk so much at this age. What will happen when you grow up? They are coming. Don't tell them that l've told you about them. l'll tell them? - Don't tell them. Are you not talking to each other? How are you now father? l didn't know that there exists a disease like this. ls it paining father? - Yes. But it is a sweet pain. What is it father? - Come over here. Come closer to him. Now what is your decision? - We came to inform you about it. Good. You could manage to do what l couldn't achieve in six years. You should do everything for me. - l'll have to do it myself now. First go and ask her parents for her hand. How did father come to know about this? Between you... - Between us... l was told about the line. - Line? Who told you? This naughty girl. Come. Let's sit inside. l was going to come to meet you. Annie told me everything. Father would've accompanied me, but he has still not been discharged. l don't have anyone else. You know that. l know. l looked after her, after her father's death. l'll always wish good for her. The Kurushingal family is renowned and has a lot of wealth and estates. But when it comes to making relations we still make mistakes. Have some coffee. l'm least interested in this proposal. You must be a master in your profession. But you don't have... a name of your own. You are an orphan and you dream of marrying Annie. We didn't see our families before falling in love. Maybe. lf she makes mistakes, l'm the only one here to correct her. You're not only in the habit of picking fights without any reasons... and there is not a single night when you don't get drunk. l apologise on behalf of Annie if she has agreed to marry you. You don't talk. l'm talking in the capacity of your father. You were right, doctor. l shouldn't have come here. An orphan, born in this big city, does not have any right... to marry a girl like Annie who is born in a big, reputed family. l didn't know that a family name is a requisite for marrige. Where are you going at this hour? l can't wait for you all night. l don't want to spoil my life. l'm leaving for Vailankanni. From there, l'll go to my native place. You were only one left to leave this place. You may go. l'm an orphan. Go away. l didn't want to fall in love but she made me fall in love. And insulted me saying that l didn't have a good family background. l thought she'll come with me when l left her house. She didn't come. Why are you waiting now? Go away. l'll go. Why did this queen come to my house in the night? Do you want to know more about me? Or d'you want to insult me some more? l didn't love the orphan who meekly walked out of my house. l loved the good human being who fought for the down-trodden. l was not ashamed about your uncle's insults... but it was your silence which made me weak. Had you uttered a single word, l would've left the place with you. l couldn't because my mother is lying on a bed due to paralysis. When she blessed me happily l left the house to be with you. Now l can go to Vailankanni. Now l can imagine things. Now we'll be like this for days... - No. We'll be like this for years. Will you tell me the truth if l ask you something? l'll decide only after you tell me. You were against marriage. Then why did you... - Because l love you very much. That's what l'm thinking about. ls it because of your round eyes? Or is it because of your long nose? Or is it because of your sweet smile? Or is it because of your frog like face? Don't say anything? - Annie, l was only joking. Why so many clothes? The conference is only for three days. Every morning and evening, you should change your dress. l'll just show my face and take a return flight home. Not necessary. lt's a national level surgeon's conference. Attend the conference all the three days and submit your papers. lyer is lucky. He say's that Subbu can't live without him for a single day. lt's not even a year of our marriage. You are not crying nor do you have the pain at parting. Hey, what happened? l too wish you could always be with me. But l've married a famous surgeon. l don't want to spoil your career. l didn't mean to hurt to you. l didn't have anyone of my own. After marrying you, l've got everything in life. So l want to return from the conference as soon as possible. What's all this? - Nothing. l'm leaving for Bombay. What is the matter? - l just dropped in. Actually l had come to meet Roy. But when he was leaving l didn't want to tell him about my problems. My left leg has started paining again. l'm going to the hospital. l'll have a detail check up of father. But l don't want any injections and blood tests. l was shocked to see this. - There's nothing to worry about. This is an x-ray of a good old-man who donated his kidney. Or of a man who has sold his kidney for money. But father doesn't fit in both the categories. Which father? - Father Thayil. Your patient. He was scared of an injection. How could he agree for a major surgery? l don't remember father talking about this. There's no doubt about it in father's case. lt's a case of having one kidney since birth. Why this x-ray and other tests? Father had come in morning with a backpain. lt was a routine check up. Good. He's my patient. Tell him to come and meet me. Why do you need this old report? - Oh simply. l wanted to compare the old and new x-ray. That's okay. But the x-ray was done some six years ago. l'll take your leave. l hope there is no problem? - Oh no. Sir, Dr. Annie is comparing the old and new x-rays of father Thayil. l think she knows about the missing kidney. Don't worry. l'll decide what to do. l remember going out for cycling. But l got up in a hospital. l'm doing a research on accident cases. Will you allow me to take a fresh x-ray of yours? ls Roy Mathew there? - No. Please call Mrs. Roy. This is Mrs. Mathew speaking. Who is it? Roy? Where're you calling from? From the airport. - But you said you're coming tomorrow. l've come back. l don't want to be alone. Roy, come here quickly. l have a surprise for you. Be ready. We'll go out for dinner tonight. Calling your wife? You should call up sometimes. Roy. Has he reached so soon. Roy don't play with me. Roy, l was scared. Can you identify the intruder? Was it a love marriage? - Yes. Even mine was a love marriage. lt was very romantic. Did you have problems with Annie's family? lt is always the family which creates problems. l can understand. Why did you come back from the conference mid-way? Any problems at home? ''l wanted to see you so l came back. What conference without you?'' Now all the property of Annie will be inherited by the doctor. What are you talking about? You are not only a good doctor. But you are a good actor too. You killed Annie to inherit all her properties. How can you say that? l can never dream of that. How dare you put the blame on me. l have told you many times. l have seen him. He was a one-handed man. He's the man who killed my Annie. Go and find him. This is advocate Rajendran. We tried for your bail but couldn't succeed. All the evidence is against us. lf we could find the one handed man... There is no evidence that such a person had come to Roy's house. Roy, you don't worry. Your honour on August 1 7, 1994. Dr. Roy Mathew killed his wife Annie. l submit all the evidences to prove this charge in the court. According to the post-mortem reports, Annie died of brain heaommorage. She was hit on her forehead. There was no finger-prints found except that of Dr. Roy and Annie. The finger-prints of Dr. Roy is clearly visible on the flower vase... which was used to kill Annie. The skin sample found between the nails of Annie has proved... to be matching the skin of Dr. Roy. Before dying, Annie had informed the police control room that... Dr. Roy was trying to kill her. ''Where are you calling from ?'' Dr. Roy didn't want to get married till the age of 35. ln order to inherit all the estates of Dr. Annie, he hatched a plan. And fell in love with her and forced her to marry him. And when he got everything, he killed her mercilessly. There was no need for my client to kill his wife for her property... because all the property of Annie was transferred in my client's name.. after marriage. Then why should my client kill Annie? What is your name? - Devika Rani. How many years have you known Dr.Roy? - Four years. Would you deny the fact that both of you lived like husband and wife. l asked you, will you deny it? - No. Did he ever promise to marry you after inheriting... Annie's property and eliminating her from your way. Yes, he did. ls it true that you were against the marriage of Annie with Dr. Roy? Yes. - Reason? Will you deny the fact that the marriage was a short-cut for Dr.Roy... to inherit Annie's properties. Come on. Why don't you speak? One week before Annie's murder the hospital and other properties... of Annie were transferred to Roy's name without my knowledge. Now l'm sure that Roy married Annie only because of her wealth. Do you have anything to say? When l go to the operation theatre to operate on a patient, l sincerely... pray that l don't make any mistakes. Because the patient depends on me. All l can now say is that l didn't kill my Annie. For selfish gains and for killing his own wife mercilessly the... the court convicts Dr. Roy under section 302 of... lndian Penal Code to life imprisonment. Father, what sin have l committed to see this day? This not the end of the road. - We'll go in for an appeal. You will be victorious. Not only us even Annie's soul is praying for you. Truth will always win. Father, my Paru Kutty... - We'll take care of her. Did all the convicts die? - Yes sir. lnspector Khan is arriving? Oh no. Now he won't leave this area without a search. Comb the place of accident properly. But the local police... Should they do their duty properly, why would we need to come here? How did this happen? - Sir, it was a well planned attack. ln the scuffle, the driver was shot and he lost the control of the van. l could only save a guard before the vehicle exploded. What about the convicts? - They must've died sir. Are you sure? - Yes sir. There is a handcuff but not the hand? Who had the keys? Keys. keys... - Trying to change your version, eh? When the vehicle lost control, l removed Dr. Roy's handcuffs... to save one of my colleagues. But before that the vehicle exploded. l don't remember beyond that, sir. - You don't remember... or did you jump before the explosion to save yourself. We've identified the bodies of Abdul Hamid and Ramlingam but the other two.. Report to all the police stations. Two convicts have escaped. The fugitives are Pitamber and Dr. Roy Mathew. Dr. Roy has escaped from jail. lt is dangerous for us if the father lives. Where are you going in the morning? - For jogging. To nab the convicts, we have got all the details and photos... to be issued to all the newspapers and TV channels. Good. But that's not necessary. Let them think that they're safe... then it'll be much easier to nab them. lnform all the hospital in this area because he is injured... Sir we have spotted the convicts in the northern area. l don't want to work with you. lf you would've missed the aim... l don't wait for anyone and l don't miss the bull's eye. ls there any fax message for me? Doctor, have you seen this person? - No. Dr. Roy Mathews. Convicted for life imprisonment for murdering wife. Near acquaintances. Father Thomas Thayil,... Dr. V.D. lyer? V.D. - Skin specialist sir. No relatives. - No sir. Don't laugh. - He doesn't have anyone of his own. lnspector Murli is sure that it has been taken by Dr. Roy. Dr. Roy, it's better to surrender now. Hello. Who is it? Sir, Dr. Roy. l can hear the church bell. Trace the call. We don't know each other. But l know that Mr. Khan is a sincere officer. That's why l'm telling you that l didn't murder my Annie. l'm not bothered about all this. - You should. A one-handed man killed Annie. l'm trying to find him. You should've said all this in court. The court has given its verdict. Being a sincere officer, it is my duty is to arrest the convict. Within forty eight hours, l'll handcuff you. And my duty is to find the killer of my Annie. Before you handcuff me, l'll prove my innocence to you. Take care. Now tell me. What is this all for? lt's the duty of the wives to perform. lt is beleived that if a wife lights a hundred candles... she would live happily with her husband for 100 years. l had asked for this wish. l want to live with you all my life. Who is it? l didn't recognise? Father Thayil...? He met with an acciodent. He had gone for jogging. Why does everyone l love die, uncle? My mother died, Annie Uncle died, Father has also passed away. Everyone says that you killed Annie aunty. Do you believe them? - No. l won't leave uncle now. - Uncle need to go. Shouldn't l catch the man who killed Annie aunty? Once l catch him, l will take you away. No. You should take me right now. Your name is Paru Kutty, isn't it? Come dear. Don't be scared. Did Dr. Uncle come here to meet you? What did he tell you? lf you tell me the truth, l won't harm him. He told me that he'd come to take me once he nabs Annie aunty's murderer. Dr. Uncle is not bad. He didn't kill Annie aunty. He is innocent. What's the disease? - l'm from the police department. Most of my patients are from the police department. Don't feel ashamed. Tell me what's the matter? l didn't come here for consultation. l'm here to question you. Miss Devika Rani was lyer's weakness. lsn't it? Not only mine. She was everyone's weakness. She's been killed. Do you want to know who killed her? Your close friend, Dr. Roy. But Roy is in jail. - So you don't know anything. Roy has escaped. He'll come here to meet you. What will you do then? This is me, Roy. So early. Not possible. - This is me. Dr. Roy. l'm in serious consultation with a police officer. We'll meet later. Tell me where should l meet you. l'll be near the church at Wellingdon Road. My friend. He wanted me to join him for a drink on Sunday. That's good. ls the name of your friend Roy? Cops have the tendency to suspect everyone. That's true. lt's a crime to help a convict and l hope you know that. We'll have to meet again. When you called up, he had some doubts. He's very sharp. Only because of God's blessings... - What blessings? Even the murder of Devika Rani has been rapped on me. God will show us a way. Only the City Hospital has the artificial limb centre. lsn't it? The one handed man should have some connections with the hospital. Why don't we start from there? Let's start from there. We might get some clue. l need your help for everything. And a place to hide. Some cash and some make-up materials to change my identity. l'll always be there with you till you prove your innocence. l need my friend back. Dr. Roy had said that a one-handed man had killed Annie. Then why didn't you investigate that angle? We had all the evidence that Dr. Roy had himself killed his wife. Moreover, we thought that it was just to divert our attention. Didn't he kill the nurse one day after he escaped from the jail? Can we give this photo and news to the press? Not now. l'll give it to them whenever l feel like it. So you're running away from me to find something. Run as much as you can from me. l'll be right behind you. Grandmother. Where's Ananda Prabhakar Roy? - He's tense and is waiting for you. l got this book from the City Hospital's artificial limb centre. You'll come to know what types of limb fittings are there. And this is limb centre's details. All the names of patients who have... been fiited with artificial limbs are fed in the computer. We'll have to get it from the Data Bank. l stole this identity card of an attendant. lt could be handy. You said something about Dr. Roy. Could you please repeat it? He didn't marry till the age of 35. Suddenly he fell in love with Annie. Marriage, and then Annie's death. There is something wrong somewhere. l was against their marriage. l'm now convinced that he married... Annie because of her wealth. Dr. Roy must've escaped from jail to prove his innocence. Will you let me know if you know anything about Dr. Roy? Sorry. As a good colleague, l'll help him to prove his innocence. Dr. Menon, 28 convicts escaped since l'm in service. And l've caught 24 of them. Can't Roy be the fifth person who has escaped? The four of them didn't escape. He shot them dead. This is Father Tahyil's orphanage. - Let's enquire... Enquire about this woman. l'll be back soon. - Okay. Open the door. Open it up. Open up, or else we'll break the door. Who is it? What do you want? Do you know this man? l asked do you know this man? - No. Your facial expression says that you know him. That room. Whose trouser is this? - My son's. The waist of this trouser is 38 and this trouser cannot fit Dr. V.D. lyer. You're telling lies. lsn't it? What happened? - A school bus crash. Take this kid to the observation room immediately. Who, me? - Yes. Who else? Don't worry. You'll be all right. Your parents will be arriving soon. You three check the entire place. l'll be upstairs. lt's an emergency operation. Don't worry. This is not the kid l had sent. His name was Master Arun. He was not brought here. A man with a moustache must've brought him. Stop there. Didn't l tell you to take a kid to the observation room. Now where is he? Not observation room. You told me to take him to the operation theatre. What are you doing? Did you find only this identity card from a man who took the kid to the... operation room who was not a hospital's attendant? lt was an emergency situation. The man would've escaped before l called for the security. Can l leave now? - Yes. Excuse me Doctor. How is the kid? - He's saved only because of him. You may go. The fugitives go out of town to save themselves. And here is one who is disguising himself and roaming here... There has to be some motive for Dr. Roy coming to the hospital... taking so much of risk. Stop. What's your name? - Perumal. What happened? - An accident. Where are you going now? - To the artificial limb centre. Delete the name of Raghavan. He's no more. Did the man Dr. Roy talked about have artificial left or right limb. Left sir. - Check the file. Tell me how many people have fixed left limbs. So what happened? This Basheer has been in the wheelchair since four months. Dr. Roy's wife was killed on August 1 7, sir. Roy had said that he broke the artificial limb in the scuffle. Can you tell me how many people re-fixed their limbs... from August 1 7 to September 1 7. - Yes. l'll do that. Five people. - l need their full details. Abdullah, check if any of these people have any criminal record. Sakariya has a criminal background. - But he is in a mental hospital. Yes. l want to meet him. According to reports, he was admitted there three months ago. Then why do you want to see him? - Even my record is clear. Yet l'm being blamed for the murder. l want to see him. We don't allow him to meet other patients. Father must know that. He has some criminal case... He realised his mistake after murdering his wife. Because of the shock, he's become psychotic. Sakaria, father has come to see you. Have you taken the permission to meet the patient? He's not the man l wanted to meet. Father, you go ahead. We're old friends. l'll join you later on. He's coming to catch me. Go and tell him. l'm calling from Bombay. l'll be coming there by the morning flight. Listen doctor, the operation has to be done tomorrow itself. Because l've to send that thing by evening. Sorry, it's not possible. You are asking me to betray you? - You can't do anything to me. My people and l are not involved in the case. Tell me, do you remember Dr. Annie? l still have evidence against you which l had picked up from her place. Okay. The operation will be done. But l want all the evidence back. l've got all the evidence back. There is no need for the operation. As decided, l'll be waiting for you at the car park. Roy, you? - Yes. lt's me. l know everything now. You're the one who cut the kidneys of the poor and sold them to the rich. Roy, listen to me. l didn't kill Annie. He knows who killed my Annie. l'll make him speak. Dr. Roy listen to me. l'll make him speak the truth. Marcos, who made Annie kill? - Speak up. Speak up. - Tell the truth. Dr. Roy killed Dr. Marcos and not Menon. Roy's third murder. You cannot believe it. lsn't it? l had to take away the organs... of many poor people for my benefit. l don't consider it a crime. When Annie opposed it, l had to kill her. Don't get excited. Roy alone can't do anything to us. We are very big. lt's an international racket. You don't have the guts to fight them. The police will be arriving soon. When all the evidence is with me... is it not wise of you to surrender. Tell me where is he? The one handed man who killed my Annie. Dr. Roy, Dr. Marcos has admitted to us that you are innocent. Leave him to the law. A doctor's duty is to save a life, and not to take it. l have given him a death sentence for killing my Annie. Roy, there is an orphan girl who is waiting for your return. With four black peppers and some herbal leaves. The handcuffs are meant for criminals and not innocents. This hand should save thousands of people.
