Jules! Jules! You can't hide from me. We need to talk this out! Jules... Jules, come out here. Don't make me come in there and get you. Jules. I came here to start over, to try again. You hit me. You hit me with divorce papers. That can never happen. You're scaring me, Billy. I'm scared of myself. What do you want from me? I am your husband. You are my wife! My god, Billy, what did you do? We gotta go! We gotta get... oh! You told me you loved me. We stood in front of everybody. Billy, it's over. You gotta let me... For better or for worse. In sickness and in health. - Let me go! - Till death do us part! Come on, Billy! Billy, come on, we have to go! Billy, the house is burning! We gotta go now! I'm going to get help. Call 911! Jules!

Jules, that's beautiful. And it's powerful, the way that the yellow, it draws your eyes up from the almost black near the base. It's shaded in deep blues. Now that I look at it, it's kind of provocative. Cool colors tend to fade, but here, the blue really pops. Strength where it's unexpected. Strength when it's discovered. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to hear more about your process. About you. Jules? Is it against the rules to ask you out on a date? Mine or the class's? Yours. No. No to the date or to the rules? To the date. Ah. Why? It's complicated. I can handle complicated. I'm not ready? So you'll think about it? No, but thank you. All right, class! Welcome back to the self-portrait class. Today we are gonna do something a little different. You're gonna start with a fresh canvas. And I want you to dig deep down inside and... and paint how you feel. Let me see it. Let me see your colors in all your hues. What has gotten into that Inge today? She think we're all Olympians or something? Well, you are in the baddest shape of anyone in that class. I'm not badder than Inge. That Norse bitch! Well, my ass thanks her. Ah, yes. So? What's the tea with the hot engineer? Paul? Please, of course Paul. Did he push for the date yet? Yes. And you said yes. I woke up in a panic last night. I could actually feel Billy's hands around my neck. Maybe you shouldn't be back at the house. You know, the upstairs is not done yet. And with all the people coming and going... I know. I know, but I'm... I'm actually enjoying it, you know? I get to pick out all the colors. The designs are mine alone. It's like everything he tore down, I get to rebuild, like a rebirth. Just not with the house... With me too, you know? Remember what you told me that first night? I will not live in fear. Damn straight. Going back to school. Opening your studio. Building your business every day. Everybody wants a peek at the freak! The people in this town, they all think I killed Billy. - Jules... - What, you didn't know? I'm the Lethal Lover. The Hardcore Husband Killer. Stop, okay? Stop. You are the strongest, most courageous woman I know. I'm not. But I appreciate the praise. That's what friends are for. And as far as I can see, just another reason to get up on that yummy engineer so he can get down on you. Uh, I don't need another reason to date Paul. Oh, hello, okay! Did he spill paint and have to take his shirt off again? Mm... Okay, I need the deets. Uh-huh, I will give them to you later. But I gotta go get cleaned up so I can see Ron. I thought you saw Dr. Ron on Thursdays. Yeah, I'm back at twice a week again. Can't squeeze all my crazy into one session. I can't rush my recovery. I need... time. Whoo! It's colder than death in here! Kenny? Yeah? Uh, I had this set at 75 during the day. I didn't change it. It's now at 50. Right, let me look at it. System seems to be okay. You know, one of the workers probably messed with it. - I'll ask them, okay? - Okay. Thanks. Oh, your back deck's almost done. It's gonna be beautiful. You open up those doors, it's gonna feel like your entire living room is outside. You gettin' me through this, Kenny. You gettin' me through! - Thank you! - You bet. And when I saw the thermostat set low, I froze. Even years from now, something could happen to trigger you. Your first thought will be Billy. That's what long-term trauma does. It actually changes the brain. He liked it cold. I mean, really cold. We used to fight about it, control over the thermostat. Dana used to say, "Cold hands, cold heart, close to death." Hm. You know, b-before he actually died. You won't always be so scared. The brain is wired for survival, though. Takes time to learn new responses. Give it time. When we can calm our fear response, we can see things clearly. Make a rational decision instead of one based off of fear. Yeah, exactly. How long did it take you to calm down? Well, it felt like it was forever, but I guess about a minute or two. And how long would it have taken you just a couple of months ago? Uh-huh, Dana would've had to come over and check under every bed, then have some wine with me, probably spend the night. You're not the woman you were. That's true. Thanks to you. Oh, you get all the credit for that, and your classes. You have a gift for this. Helping people, it comes naturally to you. You know, in the short time I taught, I've seen the emotion that I can pull from people. I'm putting a show together. Of your work? That's wonderful. Not just of mine. Um, some of my students from my self-portrait class. I could see them staring at themselves on canvas, finding healing and direction. Jules the art therapist. Jules the art teacher, now. Hey, you're an artist no matter what. Nuh-oh, I know that look. You wanna cut our session short so you can go paint. No, that's not... I mean... I wanna capture this feeling, but I don't even know what to call it. It's called fulfillment, Jules. Nobody deserves it more. Jules Moss? Jules Baker. Moss was my married name. I'm Detective Walker. This is Detective Young. We're sorry to bother you. We just have a few questions. - Can we come inside? - Now? My house is being renovated. It's not a good time. We don't mind. It'll only be a few moments. Yeah. Okay, I guess you gonna do what you wanna do. I... I don't understand. Why are you here, Detective? We need to talk about June 5th. - The night of the fire. - Yeah, I remember that night. It's kind of burned in my head. Well, we just need to go over the details one more time. Oh, from when my husband tried to murder me? No, no, no, no. See, I've worked very hard to move past that night. I don't see why you can't do the same. We have new evidence suggesting that your house fire wasn't an accident. The gas line was tampered with. And given your relationship with the deceased, - you are a person of interest. - I'm sorry. You... you think I torched my own home? Now, why would I do that? Well, why don't you tell us? You left your husband in that house. He died in that fire, Ms. Baker. He tried to kill me in that fire, Detective Walker! But the fire is now suspicious, and given your complicated history... It's not complicated. He made my life hell. I reported it. I couldn't get a restraining order because they told me you can't press charges for words. Hm. You stand to gain a lot of money from his death. Yeah? It seems like enough reason to... Off my husband? You want motive? How about alimony? Billy Moss made a lot of money. I had every reason to keep him alive for a long, long time... Away from me, but alive. Well, you've been spending a lot of money, rebuilding the house. And after such a short grieving process, you started a new relationship. Oh, I'm sorry. It is new, isn't it? Are you following me? We have been keeping an eye on you here at the house and at the gallery. I knew I saw someone at the gallery. Jesus Christ, you people! Here's how it's gonna go, Ms. Baker. Jules? Oh my god, don't shoot. I'm just the neighbor. Naomi, what are you doing here? - Uh... - I'm sorry. I saw the squad car out front, so I wanted to make sure you were okay. I'm fine. But when an officer pulls a gun in my house, it's time for you to leave. You are done here... Right, Officers? Detectives. And yes, thank you. Oh, one more thing. Given the circumstances, the insurance companies are more than happy to wait until we've finished our investigation before paying out. Good luck on your renovation. And if you think of anything that might help with our investigation, please feel free to call. And I'm sorry. I can't believe this! That was crazy! Are you okay? Yeah... no... God, god, I don't know. I thought I had put all this behind me. And now they think I killed Billy? That's crazy! It's not surprising, the way that people talk. And they've been watching me at the gallery. They think I've started up a new relationship. You started a new relationship? No. But I can if I want to. It's my life. Billy doesn't control it anymore. - Right. - God. Think I can get one of those? Yeah, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry about that bottle, too. Ah, don't worry about it. We can clean it up later. Okay. Thanks for coming over. You know me. Butting in is kind of my jam. Man, I am so grateful I have Ron. - Is that the new guy? - What? No. There... there's no guy. Ron is my therapist. He's been keeping me sane ever since Billy. I don't know how I'd survive without him. Promise me you'll call me if you need anything, okay? Okay. I'm serious, like, anything at all. You know I'm all about us being friends, not just neighbors. Well, thank you, I appreciate it. Cheers! Shhhhhh... You look beautiful. Thank you. So do you. - You ready? - Yeah. I'm looking forward to this date. The police came to your house? Why? They think that I... Oh, forget it. No, don't do that. For real, tell me. Well, didn't you hear? I'm a killer date. Oh. And bringing a killer on the first date to a taco truck, that's a bit risky. But it's a slam dunk for me, so you get to live. Oh, I see, you like Mexican. I love Mexican. Billy hated it and I was never allowed to eat tacos, and now all I wanna do is eat tacos. Never allowed? Jeez. I guess some people are like that. They can't stand to see anyone happy. They always gotta find a way to ruin it. Nah, he wasn't always like that. But man, towards the end? That must've been hard for you to live with. You're the exact opposite. What do you mean? Uh, I studied you a bit in class. Mm-hmm! Oh! Last week, you seemed a bit down. But when Louisa was so excited to paint light and shadows, you glowed. You had this inner joy. You... you magnified it. Well, she killed it. Yeah. I mean, painting light is very hard. Will you tell it? Should we order some more? I mean, it being my first date, I'm supposed to eat like a lady. But can we get four more carne asadas, extra jalapeños? Wanna feel the burn! Okay! I think they got you. - I have a question. - Mm-hmm? Have you ever taken martial arts classes? Really! Oh, I can teach you a few moves. Oh? Wait, wait, no, wait. Defensive moves. Uh-huh. I've been training since I was nine years old. I was... I was like the little Black karate kid. - Wah! - Watch out. Oh, yup, oh, oh! If I had some chopsticks, I would... I would catch a fly right now. No, and you know, I still... I still train. I help out at the dojo on 7th and Main. - Karate engineer. - Mm-hmm. I'd love to see that. Really? Anytime. They do a... they do a class Saturday mornings. They teach self-defense. And then after that, the... You know what? You should come to see the kids. Have to see the kids. They're so inspiring to watch. You can actually see their growth from one class to the next. Billy! What? Uh, I thought I saw my husband, dead husband. Where? Over there by those trees? But I... I know I didn't see him 'cause he's not alive. My god, what is wrong with me? Jules, look at me. Nothing is wrong with you. I wouldn't be so sure. Every day I'm glad that bastard's dead. I know that's a terrible thing to say. You wanna talk about it? I do, but... another night. Well, here's to another night. - So you're okay? - I am, I am. Hey, I... thought I left that light on. You sure? Y-yeah. Never mind. I can go in there and check it out for you. No, it's... it's probably nothing. Okay, well, I had fun tonight. Me too. Wait, what was that? What was that? Abby? Abby? Oh, hi, I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't mean to interrupt anything. No, no, it's okay. I'm, um, looking for Abby? - Abby? - My cat. Well, we just got home. I haven't seen her. Okay. Who's this? - This is Paul. - Paul, Naomi. - It's nice to meet you, Paul. - Nice to meet you as well. You know, I'll just... I'll just get out of your way. - Didn't mean... sorry. - No, no, it's okay. Um, good night, Paul. - I'll call you tomorrow? - Please. - It's nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you too. Did I just interrupt some pre-smashing of some sort? No, no, no, no, no. Okay, well, that's the guy, right? Yeah, that's the guy. I'll let you know if I see Abby in the backyard. Thank you. I appreciate it. Welcome. Night. What the hell? How is it set to 75? Jules? It's just me, it's just me, just me. What are you doing here? I got a notification on my phone about your thermostat. I came to fix it. I just... I thought it might override the system. Seriously, you just let yourself in? No, no, I... I knocked on the door. I rang the bell. I thought I was gonna be in and out. I forgot my toolbox. - See? - Yeah. Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. - We're good? - Yeah, we're good. Okay. When was the last time you slept? I didn't last night. The thermostat, the seeing something in the park, I get. But that picture? Who put that there? Maybe one of the construction guys found it. Didn't know whether to throw it out or not. Consider sitting down, Jules. Okay. Okay. I think I saw my dead husband, who the cops think I murdered, so there's that. I get it. There's a lot going on. But you know how to calm yourself. You have learned the techniques. Remember what we practiced? Yeah. Close my eyes, take three breaths in, take three breaths out, open my eyes. It's like a mini reset. So go ahead. Man, that really works. Well, you might need to take a few more of them breaths before I hit you with this. What now? The insurance company. They're stopping payment on Billy's policy and the home policy pending police investigation. That sucks. Totally, but I figured a way to run the numbers. You can keep the work going on the house. Just one request. - Paul. - Oh? Forget all this nonsense and keep that second date with him. He makes you smile. It's a good look on you. ♪ Oh, we had great plans ♪ ♪ And we played by the rules ♪ ♪ But we lost our way ♪ ♪ 'Cause no one's fireproof ♪ ♪ Sometimes dreams, they seem true ♪ Jules! Oh my god, oh... Come on. Okay. Oh. ♪ We're in this together, we're in this together ♪ ♪ Ain't giving up tonight ♪ ♪ We're in this together, we're in this together ♪ Five minutes late. There was traffic and I'm so... Is Ron in his of... Helen, what's wrong? Ron was in an accident! Oh my god! He's in the hospital, on life support. What happened? He was just out jogging. And he got hit by a car. - Is he gonna be okay? - Listen, I don't know. I don't know, I don't have time for this. I just have to still make all these calls, and I have to let his patients know. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ms. Baker. What, you following me again, Detective Walker? No, absolutely not. I'm here investigating an accident. Ron Winslow? - How do you know? - He's my therapist. I had an appointment with him today. Is he okay? It's not good. He didn't make it. Hit-and-run. Witness says they saw a car speeding off, but... that's all we got. We will find who did this. Count on it. Excuse me. Oh, um... Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Where were you this morning? I'm so sorry. Man, I only got this far because of you and Ron, and now... It's okay. His memory will always be a blessing to you and you're not alone. You got God, and I'm here. And we aren't going anywhere. Thank you. I know it's a lot, but the best way for you to honor his memory is by remembering his advice. He always said you were stronger than you know. This didn't look like this yesterday. Yeah. The bright yellow in my life is gone. Listen, um, I'm sorry. Maybe you've signed up for some lightweight kind of crazy, but... that's cute, and maybe a little exciting. I can handle a little crazy, Jules. No, you don't want this kind of crazy coming at ya. I'm talking like 5150 lock-her-up crazy. I just don't think I can handle this right now. If you don't want to see me, I get it. Okay? But... Maybe I can help you. As friends. - How? - By teaching you. Making sure that you never have to fear anyone else again. Now, I don't know if it works on ghosts... I'm sorry. But we can give it a try. Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Nice. Good, right. Good, good. Nice look. Yeah, I guess I forgot to tell you I'm a crash test dummy. I'm the assailant that the women usually come after. - Ah. - Mm-hmm. Jules, Miranda. Miranda, Jules. She is our fearless leader. - Very nice to meet you. - You too. Make sure you watch out for her. She kicks ass... mostly mine. All right, so there's three self-defense moves that every woman should know. The first is the open hand strike. Hah! Second is kick to the groin. Yah! Or a knee to the groin, if you're close enough. Hah! I know, it's a lot, I know. You're in good hands, all right? We got you. Miranda, let's put 'em all together for her. Got it. Okay, plan B. Uh, maybe I should just get a gun. Um, gun is not usually the best answer. Are you prepared to shoot somebody? Oh, no. Mm, just that hesitation right there. Just one quick move. Your opponent has disarmed you and now they have your weapon. Never point a gun unless you're prepared to shoot. Okay. Teach me. Let's do it. Okay, so it's two objectives. One, you always wanna get free. Two, run away. First thing I'mma do is I'm gonna teach you how to throw a knee into my groin. Oh, god, okay. All right, what you wanna do is you wanna take your... your hand, put it on my shoulder, and then you're gonna hold my wrist. - Okay. - Drive your knee into my groin. All right, let's try. - You're fine, go ahead. - Okay. Mm! Harder. - I don't wanna hurt you! - Jules, go! - I'm doing it! - Harder! All right, all right. This ain't the kids' class. Okay, okay, okay. - Come on, do it hard. - That was hard! No, it was... do it hard! I got this gear on, you're good. - All right, okay. - Let's go. Don't grab my wrist... Oh my god, I am so sorry. No, um... that was... that was better. Oh my god. Billy. Are you okay? Stick with me. No... I want you to see with your mind and your eyes, and then your body. Take your left arm, swing it across! Break the grip. Get free, run away. Okay, I usually have to do deep breaths for this, but this works too. You know... I never met anyone like Billy before in my life. I mean, he could make standing in line feel like the best date ever. We married three months after we met. - Really? - Yeah. In the beginning, we were so in love. Unstoppable. You couldn't tell us nothin'. And then, about a month in, he had his first bout with depression. He was unhappy, and because he was unhappy, I had to be unhappy too. I'm sorry. He knew he had this control over me. It was, like, protective at first. And then... demeaning. He was never happy with me. My hair, my clothes. I wasn't perfect in his eyes. He let me know it, and I believed him, too. You think I'm crazy, huh? No, I don't think you're crazy. You loved him. You wanted to see the best in him. Yeah, but then it got worse. You don't have to tell me. It was all about my art. He knew how it made me feel. He even tried to get me to stop going to art class. But I was determined. Good. One night, he was in the backyard. I came out. All of my paintings, he destroyed them. - What? - Yeah. Um, when I tried to regain my balance, he just knocked me right back down, telling me I wasn't talented, I was a waste. But I fought back. I fought toe to toe, you know, like... - sticking up for myself. - As you should. But then I realized I couldn't stop him. And I remember, man. I remember his face every time. It was like... Like he was satisfied with destroying me every time. And... and then that's when I knew, if I did not get out, he would win. But... I didn't leave. I stayed. I stopped... stopped fighting, just took it... his words. And then I would be like, you know, go into, like, a comatose state. Try to disassociate. I... I know it was a survival technique at that point, you know, like playing dead? Yeah. To get to that point, to... to go there... it killed my spirit. Did he ever hit you? No, not until that night. And now every image of him is violent, you know? Him grabbing me, grabbing my wrist, his hands around my throat. It's all I see when I think of him. But today... Let me tell you what I realized today. On that mat, I realized that my spirit, this spirit, has so much more life to live. And I'm ready to fight back. Let's do it. Let's do it! I'm ready to use this one. - No! - Yes! - Not that one! - Mm-hmm. I've had enough of that one for today. I feel so good. I feel... strong. I feel like my energy's up. Of course, you know, sure I was a bit awkward in the beginning, but I know some moves now, and I'm ready for him if he's coming for me. - Billy? - Whoever's coming for me. Okay, warrior queen. But there's something. Maybe Billy's coming at ya from the grave. What's the matter? What is it? I did a deep dive into your home finances, and... Billy spent a lot of money each month. A lot more than he made. How is that even possible? The shade of it all. He was careful to cover his tracks. But obviously, he had another income stream. Am I involved in something illegal? I'll go through it. But the good news is... no matter how hard you try to hide it, money leaves a trail. The dark always comes into the light. What the hell? Who covered the paintings? It was him. I know it was him. Who? Billy. Can you see him? No, of course not. Oh my god, the art pieces. Oh, come on, no. Please, please, please, please, please, please... Okay. All right, all right. Please no, please no, please no. Thank god. I'm surprised he didn't destroy this one. You know what? We gotta get these projects outta here. They're way too important and they mean so much. Why are you so convinced it's him? Because he always found a way to diminish what I do. But he can't do that now. - Not anymore. - I know, but... But he's dead. He's dead. Billy is dead. Don't you think it's time to accept that? See, I knew I couldn't be this person for you. You... you just have this idea of me, this picture... I can't be all bright and shiny for you. I don't need you to be bright and shiny, Jules... You know what? What are you doing? - That's what you want? - No, that's not what I want. You know what? Come on, I'm taking you... I can find my own way home. This is who I am, Paul. And you can't handle it. You need to go. Leave. Go. What is that? Oh man, come on. Damn boys. Jules. Billy? Billy! Don't stab me, I just... I just... Naomi! Sorry, I thought that, just with everything that you're going through, it might be a nice gesture. What is... Did you see anyone? Did you see anybody? What? Did you see anyone outside my window? No, no, there's no one out here. What... What is going on? I'm sorry, Naomi, I gotta get the hell outta here. Kenny, change the locks. I'll explain later. Dana, it's... it's Jules. I need you to meet me at our spot. I'm really freaking out right now. Jules! It's me, are you okay? I saw Billy. You're scaring me. He was there. There was this... This one time, he got really angry about dinner and he... he put all the food in the garbage disposal and let it run all night long, and it just made this sound. Clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk all night. And I heard it. You're not making any sense. Why don't you believe me? You have to sleep. No. You have to stop. He's dead. No, he is coming for me. They found his body. We went to his funeral. - He's gone. - He's coming for me. Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but... I'm a lawyer! I'm used to crazy. I need you to file for a new restraining order. Against your ex-husband? He's harassing me! He's dead! Jules! I told you, he tampered with my home, with my appliances. And I... I think that he killed my therapist. Do you have any proof? I'm here. Oh, fantastic. Um, Jules was just filling me in on how her ex-husband, her dead husband, is, uh, harassing her. What have you got? She's not far off. You're not gonna believe this. Jules, do you have any idea how much money you and Billy had? Not to the penny, but... I mean, we had joint checking account and a little bit of savings. Well, I found a bit more than that. How much more? $10 million in hidden, undisclosed accounts. $10 mil... no, that's impossible. Billy's firm did a lot of business involving local city zoning and real estate loans. It's entirely plausible he was embezzling money and had been for years. But these accounts, they've shown activity over the last two months. Well, that proves he's alive. No. All the transactions were done by you. Me? I don't even... No, not you you. But a login with your name. He wanted you to have access. He wanted it to look like motive. He must have a partner. How is this even possible? The divorce proceedings, all assets split 50-50. It would've uncovered this. He didn't want that. But now that he's dead, you own all the business. Therefore, you have a right to these accounts. You've assumed them all for better or for worse. Everything points to you. Still has his hands on me. Even in death. It's not very good. Art is subjective. Or it could just be bad. It's all about taking that pain that's in here and getting it all out on that canvas. Yeah, I'm gonna need a few more canvasses. Me too. Maybe try some shading in here. Hey. You okay? Surviving. Your house is almost done. You need to put it on the market. It's messing with your head. It's not gonna help. He's just gonna follow me. You know, when Billy was alive, he would do little things like this. Let me know that he was watching. That he was in control. I mean, how else do you explain the disposal? My refrigerator door? Everything that you told me earlier, he's back terrorizing me again. But Billy is not terrorizing you. Not physically. You need to get out of that house. The sooner, the better. Oh! It's Paul. Jules's Paul? Uh, well, no, no. I tried to be. I know you did. I wanna be there for her. Our girl's not doing so well. This... what's happening may all be in her head, but she believes it. You've seen her. Maybe... Maybe I can keep an eye on her. Paul, she already thinks a man is watching her. Maybe she's not ready. Let's give her some time? Apparently, being patient is my most annoying quality, so... Yeah, she can take as much time as she wants. I'll be here. Hey, have a good day. - It was nice meeting you. - You too. What are you saying, dear? I do miss you. When you left him, you left me as well. Now that Billy's gone, I'm alone. That's what I wanted to ask you about. Do you see anyone else? I guess I see the people at the club. And I do have my standing Arts Council meetings every Wednesday. That sounds nice. Yes, my life is very full. Listen, I know it's hard. You will never understand. A mother's love is as... I loved Billy too, once. No matter what my boy did, I could never take him from this world. He tried to take me out. I left before he could... Look, I didn't come here to conflict with you. It's just... I keep seeing him. I know what you mean. You do? Grief is tricky. Makes you see things. The people you love. You saw him? Just the other day, I was... I was leaving the post office, you know, the one downtown near Billy's old office. And when I look towards the building... You saw him outside of his office? But what was he doing? Where was he going? He wasn't really there, dear. I did a double take, and he was gone. It's just grief. And wishful thinking. You didn't set that fire. You didn't kill my Billy. Of course not. The police came here. And they asked me. But frankly, I told them you didn't have it in you. You're not a strong woman, Jules. You couldn't handle him the way I did. Every day, I've got to live with this. Billy's dead. I'm not so sure he is. What are you talking about? It's just I... I keep seeing him. No, you don't. Do you think that Billy would ever fake his death? For what? For what purpose? I don't know, maybe to get... get back at me. Selfish girl! What a horrible suggestion! You two had issues. But my boy would never shadow my very existence on purpose. He would never put his mother through all of this. This is not what I... You know what? I think you need to leave. Come back here, you making up stories? So my heart could just break all over again? Get back at me for what he did to you. Maybe I was wrong about you. You are... you are cruel. You need to leave, please. Please, just leave. That's not what I... Leave! You know she's innocent. I am following the facts of the case. The info the lawyer sent, though, will show she has access to certain accounts, and that does not help her case at all. It speaks to motive. Billy must have had a partner. You wanna be a good friend. I understand that. But this does not look good for Ms. Baker. I'm worried about her, what this is doing to her mental state. She should see somebody. She can't. He's dead. Listen, I love her. But she is losing her grip. I know you have to do your job. But sister to sister? Can you just keep an eye on her? Please. All right. That's it. Okay. Enough is enough. Let's put some light back into this. Let's see if I can get this off. Boo! Billy? Billy? Hello, love. - Can... - I am. - I'm calling the police. - Good idea. Too bad they think you already killed me. We had such a good thing going on, baby. Until you ruined it. Two years, that's all I needed. Then we could've retired to the Caribbean on a little island. Rum punch and sunshine every day. Just the two of us, happily ever after. Till death do us part. But you broke that vow. Ended when I saw you with that lawyer. But you couldn't figure out what I was up to. And I begged you not to go through with that divorce, but did you listen to me? No. You never do. People go to prison for what I did, and I wasn't going to let that happen. Go ahead. Say it. Fake your own death. Look at us, look at us, Billy and Jules. Together again, just like old times. Maybe that's your new Romeo. - Why don't you get it? - You leave him alone. This is between me and you. Jules, uh, it... it's Paul. Look, I hate the way we ended things. I'm gonna stop by the studio and see if you're painting late. I'll see you soon, bye. Who died in that fire, Billy? 'Cause we know it wasn't you. John Franklin ring a bell? The homeless guy from your office? Yeah, I know, a collision of wants and needs. He wanted a place to stay, and I needed a body no one would miss. You're a blood... No, you made me like this! I didn't want to hurt anyone, Jules, but you kept pushing me and pushing me and pushing me. What happened to Ron? Ron ran into a car. You're a very dangerous person, too. You killed him. And you will for always and forever be mine. Mm, no. Yes. No! Help! Help me! Jules, what's wrong? Aah, someone help me! Hey, hey, what's wrong? It was him. He was here! No, who, who, what happened? Billy, he was here. We gotta go to the police because they think that I killed him and he's alive. I swear to god he's alive. Shh, it's okay, it's okay. Detective Walker. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here? - He was here. - Who? My ex-husband, he... he was here and he threatened me. He's alive and he's still out there. Did you see him? No, I heard her scream and I ran inside. Did you see Mr. Moss? No. Let's just calm down, okay? So we can really figure out what's going on here? Why are you here? Oh, your friend, Dana. There's new evidence that your husband may have been involved in illegal activity. Well, good, then you can arrest him then. Yeah, not in the habit of arresting dead people, but this might help your case. And what if he shows up again and I'm not here? Well, you... you know what? If it's her husband, call the media. I got something to tell you. Billy came to my studio. - Jules. - I'm not imagining this. I just need you to please believe me. Okay. But real talk? The only way you're gonna get rid of Billy is to get everything having to do with him out. This house, the finances... You haven't touched his office. We're gonna get you through this. And then you can say goodbye to Billy forever. Yeah, but I... I just need proof. I need something to convince the police that Billy's behind this. Well, let me help you. Let me go close up his office, see if there's something there. No, no, I cannot let you do that. He's only gonna use you to hurt me like he did with Ron. Promise me you won't get involved. Promise. Promise. This coffee is not gonna do it. I'll be right back. All right, Dana, you're gonna go into the dead man's office, get the dead man's records, then get the hell out. Whoo! There's nothing to be scared of. You're alive. No, I'm not. My wife killed me and now I see you're doing her dirty work. Damn, Billy. You had us all snowed. Me included. We thought you were her savior. But you are nothing but a crook. And I can prove it. I want her back. You have a funny way of showing it. And she wants to come back to me too. Wait, now that's the funny part. Jules trusted you. She believed you. She called you her best friend. You... you must... I never told her to divorce you. You know, I actually believe you. I don't care. I love Jules. I really don't give a damn about you. If you leave, and I mean leave for good, I'll tell Jules to hold off for a few months. After that, all bets are off. You better be gone gone. It sounds better. Alive or dead, you're a dick. No, no! No, no, no. Dana! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god... Uh, Detective Walker? Oh, Ms. Baker, now who's following who? Can I talk to you? Please. I just came from my best friend's funeral. All right, come on. You told me to come to you if I had anything to... My best friend, Dana, she saw Billy. She texted me. And now she's dead. And you think this was a homicide. I know! Yeah, well, I'm not quite following. Billy killed her. Okay, wait, whoa, okay. Let me get this straight. So you're saying that Billy Moss, the man that we believe is dead, is not only alive, but he also murdered Dana Marks. - Yes. - Why would he do that? What would be his motivation? To hurt me. To control me. Throughout our entire marriage, he was not okay unless I was scared. And through most of our marriage, I was terrified. I saw your reports. It's hard to prove the kind of abuse you suffered, but I can tell. Your husband was an asshole. You believe me, the reports? Because the other detectives, they... they didn't. According to the reports, you were unwilling to leave Mr. Moss. I was scared to leave him. Wish I had the guts to kill him then. You're asking me to swallow a lot of conjecture. They found his body. They found a body. Yes, I saw the text. But do you have any more? Right now, the evidence fits opposing stories... The theory of the ex-wife seeking revenge and yours, the abusive ex-husband who fakes his own death. - What does that mean? - It means there's not enough evidence for either. You have to understand something. My superiors will never authorize an investigation to look for a man they think is dead. Oh. I appreciate you taking the time to at least hear me out. Look, I've been doing this job too damn long not to know that anybody can do anything under the right circumstances. But I think you are the least likely murderer I have ever met. Thank you. Be careful, Ms. Baker. Yes. I need to exhume a body. No, I'm not kidding. When have you ever heard me kid? You should eat. She's dead 'cause of me. Jules, don't blame yourself. And she was trying to help me, trying to find Billy. Billy did this, not you. You're not responsible. Did you just say "Billy did this"? Yes. You believe me? Of course I believe you. Thanks. Dana, she asked me if she could help look for him, and I told her not to, but she just didn't listen. Well, you can't let Billy win. Abby, sweetheart, where are you? Abby? My dad used to take me and my brother fishing. He said the best way to catch a fish is to use the bait that it likes. I don't follow. A saucer of milk or a can of tuna would help find Naomi's cat faster than her yelling in the backyard. One moment. I think... You got the can of tuna. Predators can't resist the bait. Same thing applies to psychopaths. Apparently, I'm Billy's can of tuna. Yeah, he... he definitely wants you, but... He seems to go after people around you. I think we can use that against him, dangle the different kind of bait. - Yeah, me. - No. He does seem to go after people that love you. Love? Okay, let's do a full stop on that one. We can come back to that at a... at a later time. But why don't you let me help you try to find him? He's coming either way. I just want it to be on my terms. Now, we need something to make him so angry that he comes now, you know, when I'm prepared for it, like... forced perspective in art. We make him see what we want him to see. We create an illusion for him that makes coming after me irresistible. What kind of illusion? Control. Wow. Yeah, the fire door has saved all of this. - Can you grab that box for me? - Yeah. I used to think he was spying on me when he was at work. Ripped all the cameras out and put 'em in here. But we could put 'em back up. Sign me up. Okay, he'll get an alert once the app is live, after we get done setting them all up. That'll get him watching. Great, one down, seven to go. And I called the banks. I changed the passwords and I closed him out on all of his accounts. I mean, it was easy. My name is on all of them. What, I just thought we needed some extra bait. Who's that? Hm. Well, now it's time for our tuna. Wow, you look beautiful. Well, thank you. Wanna play some music? Whatever you like. I couldn't have asked for a better night, so thank you, Paul. You're welcome. You continuously impress me. Well, I hope the night isn't over. You sure? I don't wanna rush you. I'm sure. Kiss me, Paul. I need to lure him upstairs. Okay, yeah, I could hide behind the tarp. And I'll be downstairs in the living room. And the first sign of him, I'm up the stairs. No, no, I don't want you risking your life like this. We're both risking our lives. You just need to call the police as soon as he arrives. Then I run up the stairs towards you. And then? And just like you taught me, get free, run away, down the back stairs and out the door. Look, I just need to prove he's alive. I don't ever need to see that face again. Okay. Jules, be careful, all right? Once he comes inside... I know, get free and run away. There you are! You bad girl! Abby, sweetheart. Oh my god. You found her! Naomi, what are you doing here? You can't be here right now. I just... I wanted to thank you for helping find Abby. You really hate him, don't you? - Billy? - Yeah. No, I don't hate him. I hate what he did to me. Oh, Jules, he... He was always a good man. Kind and compassionate and... No, no, no, no, that was an act. Billy terrorized me. He lied to me. He made me feel diminished. - No, he didn't. - I don't care what you believe. I'm telling you, Billy is not a good man. Now, you have to go now! No, I don't. Excuse me? Surprise. You should thank Naomi, she's been very helpful. Driving you crazy has been a bonding experience. Now, I need you to unlock those accounts. - No. - Now! - Maybe... - Just give me a minute. Now, Naomi thinks I came here to talk, but we both know how this ends. Bill, you said you'd be done with this tonight. - Baby, I love you... - Plans change. Billy, I just want her gone. I sent the gas valve to the police 'cause I knew that they would suspect her. I just want this to be over so that you and I can finally be together like we talked about! You know I have the hammer with your fingerprints all over it, right? Now, I don't wanna have to do anything with it, but I will if I have to. This is not the way to start a healthy relationship, Naomi. I did all of this for you, for... for us! There is no us! How could you possibly say that? You know that we had talked about... Oh my god, what did you do!? Loose ends. Here I come! Let's fight! People kill their next-door neighbors every day! Especially people with mental problems and dangerous hallucinations. Now, this is full of your DNA. 911, what is your emergency? Jules! Don't hang up, we're tracking your location. If I can't have you, no one else can! We used to love each other, remember? Shut up! You know this is not the way you wanted it to end. You just need help. I don't need help! I needed time. And when I died, that stopped your stupid divorce stuff. I started transferring money, tried to build a life for us. But you thought you could move on. That cannot happen! The insurance... I really wanted that to work for us. Jules, I really, I really... We would've been fugitives and on the run, but we would have been rich and in love, and that's all I ever wanted from you! Or that till death to us part thing. That's happening. You first! Paul, are you okay? Yeah, I'm only worried about you. Jules! Okay, sit up, sit up. I got you. Jules! Ms. Baker! Yeah, we're up here! We need help! I got you. We're up here. So I... I added shading here to give me more depth. Jules suggested it, so... I love it. Oh, gosh. All right, here you are. Jules, you have outdone yourself. I can't believe that many people came to see our artwork. I mean, Expressions of Courage and Strength? Who doesn't wanna see that? - You hear that, babe? - Yes. I got strength and courage coming on all up in here. I'm so proud of you. Awww! I'm kind of proud of me. Oh, excuse me. Detective Walker. It's good to see you. Didn't mean to intrude on your event. Oh no, it's not a problem. I wanted you to know the body we uncovered has been identified as John Franklin. Transient. Thank you, Detective, for everything, for believing me. I didn't until it was almost too late, but that was just bad detective work on my part. Well, that's not how I see it. One more thing. The insurance payout for your house is officially yours. Case closed. Thank you again. Enjoy your party. Ah, everything looks great! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. So now that your show is a success, have you thought about what your next art show should be? Well, I was thinking nude figure, but I would need a model for that. Mm-hmm. But before all that, do... Do you remember what you said to me in the backyard? Mm... it slipped my mind. Come on, stop playing. Yeah. I said that I love you. - Guess what? - Hm? I love you too. ♪ And I know it's sad ♪ ♪ Shedding the old skin ♪ ♪ But I'm so damn twisted ♪ ♪ Oh, why why why slippin' is a negative thing ♪ ♪ It's not, yeah ♪
