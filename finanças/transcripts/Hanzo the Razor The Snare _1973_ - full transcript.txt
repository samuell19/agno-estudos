TOHO COMPANY, LTD. A KATSU PRODUCTION A lord's procession. We've got no choice. Run! Insolence! Step back! Forgive us! Spare us! Unacceptable! Don't interrupt, retainers! An officer? Kill him! Don't get in our way! Fools! So you're an officer. Why disturb Lord Okubo, the government treasurer? Those two tried to run when they saw my face. It's my duty to interrogate them. I can't just let you kill them. Hey! Tie them up. Even officers should respect courtesy. Is violence your way? What? Listen! For the law, I'll cross whatever is in my way, even treasurers. We can't kill officials for being rude. But if it were a duel, we could. Junai Mikoshiba, the fencing instructor. Kill him. I work for Lord Okubo. Not for you. Junai. Are you scared? I can kill him, but my duty is to protect the lord. No duel for me. Junai. Fight. I want to see your skill. If you wish, Lord. So it's you, Razor Hanzo. I hate officers. Draw. Junai, that's enough. Stop! Hanzo Itami, come over here. I'll forgive your rude behavior for your dedication to your work. However, Hanzo, it's disgraceful to break rules and codes of samurai on your own. It'll harm the government. You won't get away with this next time. Don't do this again. Don't you appreciate his kindness? No. - Don't be so arrogant! - Shut up! There are thousands of villains in Edo. Officers are supposed to arrest them and protect civilians! Hanzo, is that any way to talk to a lord? Of course. To hell with position! It's nothing but a cheap ornament. I'll destroy ranks and codes as long as I'm around! Tell me. If I were the Shogunate General, what would you do? I'd be even more encouraged, because it would be worth it to fight and die in his presence. Well said. You'll be summoned later. Get ready to die. Let's go! Get ready to die. They won't kill you. I will. Open the bag. - Robbers? - No. -We stripped a dead girl. - Liar! It's true. She was in the watermill hut in Ushigome. We're peasants from the neighboring village. We came to steal rice and found her dead. From the way she looks, she's from town, a rich merchant's daughter. But it's strange. She's like a slut. Look. Her nipples are dark. She must have had an affair. And her man killed her. But she wasn't strangled. No wound, either. What killed her? Women are a riddle. The best way to find the truth, is check here. She got an abortion. - It's not a murder? - Fools! Don't your noses work? She reeks of goma. - You mean sesame? So that's - - Sesame ash! Idiots! The incense monks and priests burn when they pray is called goma. Praying to get rid of babies is popular in Edo. She had an affair, got pregnant and got an abortion. I get it. After the abortion, she got sick and came here. Then she died alone. Check the temples and shrines around here. Certainly. HANZO THE RAZOR: THE SNARE Produced by SHI NTARO KATSU and HI ROYOSHI NISHIOKA Screenplay by YASUZO MASUMURA Cinematography by KAZUO NIYAGAWA Music by ISAO TOMITA Cast SHI NTARO KATSU TOSHIO KUROSAWA KO NISHI MURA KEI SATO KAZUKO I NANO HOSEI KOMATSU KEI KO AI KAWA MASAMI SANADA Directed by YASUZO MASUMURA Master, we found one near the mill. There's a shrine where women get abortions. It's run by a woman. All her servants are girls. No admittance to men. Shrines are under the control of a different magistrate, you know... sir. If we bother them, we'll get in trouble again. It's no good. We go anywhere criminals go! That's our duty! Bring the coffin. Hurry! God! Help get rid of the baby! Oshizu of Mikawaya, come this way. Come on. Undress like me. Lie down. Oshizu. God! Help get rid of the baby! Oshizu. God! Help get rid of the baby! Oshizu. I'm Officer Hanzo Itami. I'll arrest you all for getting abortions! Forgive me. My husband is a poor merchant. We already have three children. If we have another child, We'll starve. Please, spare me. Go! Prices are going up! It's the government. They made bad coins and got rid of good ones. That drove prices up. Poor people can't survive. So they have to kill their babies. What a chatterer! I improved on the usual method of abortion. I contrived a new one. It spares poor people from death. It helps the world. Spares? Then why strip? The patients have to be naked. They're ashamed. They're afraid. That's why I undress too, to get rid of their shyness and fear. You're insane. Insane or not, if you kill, you get caught. You killed a girl. Me? Killed somebody? I helped many girls, but never killed any. The victim smelled of this incense. Her name? I've helped more than a hundred girls. You expect me to remember all their names? A crazy woman ripping poor people off. Bring it! Won't this refresh your memory? Who is this? I remember. She's Omachi. - Her last name? - Surugaya. A stupid girl. She left this place alive. If she died, it's not my fault. That's what you're supposed to find out. You need a doctor too. I'll let you go, but don't kill again. Welcome - I'm Officer Itami. Let us pass. Are you Rokuzaemon Surugaya, the master of this house? Yes, sir. This is my wife, named Oko. Look. Is she your daughter? Yes, sir. We've been looking for her for three days. Never thought she'd die. Because you didn't watch over her, she got pregnant, so she got an abortion. - Pregnant? - Unbelievable! She was a virgin. She never had an affair. Fool! A pregnant virgin? I see. Your daughter was beautiful. You didn't want to give her to another man. - So you laid her. - I did not. - Incest is common. - No! Your employees, then? No. They're disciplined. She only went to Kaizan Temple to learn the tea ceremony and flower arrangement. No other places. Kaizan? The convent? Priestess Nyokai is a good instructor. She's noble and famous. I had no worries. I hear the convent suddenly became rich. Don't act up. Rokuzaemon, you're not lying, are you? You're a capable officer, Razor Hanzo. How can I lie? All right. I understand. Go to the convent and tell her, ''My daughter died of illness. We'd like to bury her in your cemetery since we've known you for years. Give us permission.'' -Why? -Why ask? Can't you obey my orders? No? We'll go right away. Oko. Looking for trouble again? - Kaizan Temple means trouble. - Yeah. - Noble people go there. - It's guarded. An ant got in, but they drove it out. Show your arms. Who do you think helped you out of prison? -We'll do anything. -What is it this time? Take the coffin there. We're Surugaya and party from this afternoon. Admit us. The priestess permitted us to bury my daughter here. Come in. Bury it. Leave now. Don't hang around. Priestess, you sure this is of the highest quality? A wealthy rice dealer's daughter. I teach her flower arrangement. Nice color, good taste. She's ripe for plucking. All right. I'll buy her. Twenty-five ryo. Thirty. Thirty five. Gentlemen, you pay a few hundred ryo for a teacup or a pot. Raise your bets. Forty. Forty three. Sixty. Sixty. Sixty. No other bidding? No? It's a deal. Payment, please. You're shrewd, Priestess. None of us merchants are smarter than you. That's right. But it's a good purchase every time, don't you think? They're sovereign gold. Much better than those new coins. They're almost pure gold. Leave Mr. Tanbaya alone and go to the other room. You enjoy torturing girls. She likes to be tortured. A perfect pair. Very nice. Well then, Here. Beat her as hard as you like. It's been a long time since last I enjoyed this. Who are you? Me? I'm an officer from hell. So you're Priestess Nyokai. Noble and famous? You make girls sex-hungry. Like Omachi of Surugaya. She was laid, got pregnant and had to die. You're responsible! Even pimps are kinder than you. I know you, Tanbaya. Hold the pillar. You know who I am? Razor Hanzo. Hold the pillar. You like beating up girls, huh? You must like being beaten, too. At a time like this! We live from hand to mouth. But you paid 60 ryo to beat up a girl! You're contaminating the country! We're sorry. It's you. Kill him! Come. Stop, bastard! We're ready. Master? -Where is he? - He's acting strange. I called him, but he doesn't answer. Is he really gonna do it? If she dies, this place will be haunted. Where am I? My torture room. Officer. How dare you arrest me! You're insane. Who's your patron? Who's behind this? You have no right to ask that. I won't tell you. It's not that you won't, but you can't. Because, if you do, you'll be killed. I'll be killed too. But I have to know. Say it! You want to get hurt? Try. I'm a priestess. If you kill me, you'll be caught and executed. I know the shogunate general and his mistresses personally. Remember that. Devil-fire. Viper. Strip her. Each stone weighs 45 kilograms. Even men can't take more than six. Let's see how many you can take. Confess everything, and you'll feel better. I'm... a samurai's... daughter. Even if I die - - Put one more. - No. If we put any more on, she won't survive. Isn't that right? Shall I try you? Yes, let's put one more on. You don't have to be dead to arrive at the River Styx. I know the limit myself. She won't die so easily. One more. Remove the stones. Hurry! Untie her. You're going to see the famous Hanzo torture. You saw hell before. This time you'll see heaven. Let's see how much of it you can take. Down! I'm a servant of Buddha. You can't do this. Whoever you are, you're a woman. Priestess, be honest. No. Tell me. Why is only your convent prosperous? Who gets the money you collect? Tell me. Who? No. Talk, or I'll stop. Don't stop. Continue. Who is it? Tell me. Louder. Treasurer Okubo. Continue! My convent is ranked high. I need money to maintain it. But I shouldn't have asked Lord Okubo for help. At first he wanted a tea party. He invited rich merchants who often bribed him. Then he said parties weren't good enough. He wanted some games. Even the noble priestess found his body irresistible. Idiot! It's too big for her to feel good. We pulled her up and down rhythmically. That's what worked. As usual, after we saw him torture a woman - We feel small. Another raid? No. We're so happy that you're okay. - By the way - - You're summoned by the magistrate. - You're wanted immediately. - They have some questions. Master... Maybe it's time I commit hara-kiri. Maybe today is your last day to be free. Master! Don't say that. Will you stay here? Or go back home? Do what you like. I remember every word you said. When I tell the truth, you'll be my witness. Won't you? NORTH MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE Officer Hanzo Itami. Look up. Do you know the structure of the government? The shogunate general reigns assisted by the chamberlains. The religious magistrate rules over shrines and temples. The treasurer collects taxes and controls mining. Two judicial magistrates, north and south, watch over the city. They rank way below those other ones. Shut up! Insolence! ''They rank way below those others''? Here's one of the magistrates. Watch your mouth! I told the truth. Shut up! The truth is this. You not only stopped Treasurer Okubo's procession, but you behaved slanderously! Yes. Shut up! That isn't all. You said that if he were the shogunate general, it would be worth it to fight and die in his presence. Yes. Did you hear that, Magistrate? Hanzo. The chamberlains are greatly upset with you. They ordered you to be severely punished for your unacceptable behavior. Hanzo, can you commit hara-kiri? Can you? -When I die, you will too. -What? I'll tell all about your girl and money scandals. Magistrate. Recently the number of thieves has increased. The treasurers are responsible. They make bad coins, so prices go up and the poor people have to steal. - So? - Listen! I have to catch thieves because of the treasurers' sins. They should thank me. I deserve no punishment. Hanzo. You trespassed in temples and shrines without permission. They're the dens of iniquity. Gambling, prostitution, abortion. All I did was expose them. To get rid of crimes is the magistrate's duty. I can say I'm Japan's best officer. Why don't you arrest Japan's wickedest thief?. Japan's wickedest thief?. Ever hear the name Shobei Hamajima? You may have heard of him, but you don't know his face. Onishi. Show him the picture of the thief. Look. He's spreading the word he'll attack the Edo mint. Terrible! That's where the currency is made. If we let them rob the mint - The honor of the government will be trampled. Hanzo. The mint is under the jurisdiction of the treasurers. If you get the thief, they'll forgive you. Do I have Lord Okubo's word? Yes. The chamberlains agreed too. Lord Okubo will even reward you. I'm honored to take the job. Hey, you. Snake Magobei. This is not the place to call me such a name. I'm chief officer, your superior. What gall. You asked me if I could commit hara-kiri. Yes. I'll do it. Try if you can. Watch me. This is how to commit hara-kiri. My stomach is full of complaints. Magobei. You like gifts and bribes. You can have my guts. As much as you like. GOLD-COI N MI NT I'm Officer Hanzo Itami. Let me pass. I'm Riku, mistress of the house. I manage the mint too. I hear you're a young widow, just as shrewd as a man. You're attractive. My son, master of the house, is only twelve. So you can talk to me about your concerns. It must be hard to be a widow at your age. Can you stand it? Did you come here to tease me? We're under the jurisdiction of the treasurer. This is no place for officers. Get out of here. You want to invite Shobei Hamajima, the thief?. There are mountains of gold coins and nuggets here. They tempt greedy thieves like him. The treasurer told me about him. We're very cautious. Don't joke around. You can't handle him. These gold coins aren't yours. They're the nation's. The people need them to live. What can I do for you? Take me to your room. Excuse me. This'll do. I'll stay here from tonight. Why in my room? Because this is your room. Besides, the key to the safe is here. The thief will come here first. I'll hide the key in another room. Please stay there. You know what he does? He rapes women after he gets money. You'll make his mouth water. He'll rape you first if I don't protect you. You want that? How long will you stay? Well, 1 0 days... a month... a year... until I get him. I refuse. My late husband won't like to let you see me in bed. I respect chastity. More important than my life. No! Don't use such trite words. If the thief is at large, he'll kill more. It's not for you to decide! Bring some food and water every day starting now. Don't let the others know I'm here. How's the priestess? Dying to see you. She misses you. Why strip? I can't stay in the closet with my clothes on. Let me put out my bed mat. You feel better now. Just as I thought, it's me you wanted. You didn't come to get the thief. You wanted me. Don't think too much of yourself. You've been acting nervous. Your employees will know I'm here. And then the thieves will know. That's why I'm giving you the treatment. Even though you said you respect chastity, you were hungry for men. Now you feel like a human being. Do you know who I am? I'm Shobei Hamajima. Open the back door. Twenty of my men are there. Give me the key. I'll get the gold. All of you shall die. That's a lie. I'm Officer Razor Hanzo. Trembling? That's fine. Tremble when scared. Smile when you're happy. That's human. And now, how will the thieves come in? Maybe through the main gate. Lord Okubo, the treasurer! Magobei Onishi, chief officer. I'm here on business. Let us pass. I don't want anyone to hear us. Come closer. What is it? We're going to remake gold coins worth two million ryo. But I want you to add more lead, and make four million ryo with the same gold. The new coin will have only half as much gold as the old one? Yes. But gold coins have been devaluated too much. Prices have gone up and the poor people are suffering. Another recoinage, and they'll have grudges against the government. Shut up! The government is suffering from a financial problem too. We have to raise money somehow. The chamberlains have already agreed with me. Do just as I say. I n return, you'll take 1 0,000 ryo, and I'll take 50,000. We'll take that as a reward. I'll come again in a few days. Get ready. Riku, you're as beautiful as ever. I can't let the thief molest you. The officers will protect you. So don't worry. Thank you. Wait. We have to watch night and day. I'll keep my men on alert. It costs us a lot to guard your house. I wonder if you're willing to compensate me for it. As they say ''Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.'' Give me 1 00 ryo. Snake Magobei. You still do that? A chief officer swindling! What? Don't give him any money. He never shares what he gets. Liar! -Well, then. -Wait! Gather your men at the office. Giving orders to your superior? When you hear a whistle, surround this house. Good-bye. You'll be sorry. I'm Gorobei Toyama from arson-robbery inspection. I'm on duty. Let us pass. A man came from the government. He called himself Gorobei Toyama. So? He wants to stay in this house tonight for security check. Let him in. Can't you obey me? What'll I do? Many human lives and a lot of money are depending on you. Don't be frightened. You have to stay calm. I manage this mint. You can count on me. Soon it'll be dark. I'll get supper for you. You really are mistress of the house. So young, yet very attentive. Aren't you scared of the notorious thief?. Whatever will be will be. Excuse me. Shobei Hamajima! I've been waiting for you. Who are you? Razor Hanzo. You're Razor? I've wanted to see you too. Kill him. Go! Hurry! Shobei, you're surrounded. Give up. All right, then. Don't move. Or she'll die. What are you gonna do? THE TREASURER Excuse me. Thank you very much for your trouble. Well done, Hanzo. They're mice in a trap now. Get them. - No. -What? Can't you see the girl in there? Hanzo. You brag and call yourself Japan's best officer. You say you'll die for the people anytime. Yes. That's the duty of an officer. Then come here unarmed. I'll let go of this girl in exchange for your life. Shobei. If you're Japan's worst thief, act like it. You're surrounded. Just give it up. Shut up! I'm ready to die. I just want to take you to hell with me. If I kill Japan's best officer, Razor Hanzo, I'll have no regrets. The villains will thank me. Go in and kill them all. Don't stay back. Kill them. Forget the maid! Shut up! You think the maid is a worm? That's why you're despised. I'm not like you. I'll save her even if it costs my life. Hanzo! You can't die for this girl? Is it the duty of an officer to let her die? You only talk, that's all! You're scared! You're not Razor Hanzo. You're Coward Hanzo. Chicken Hanzo! If I'm wrong, prove it. Hanzo. Your specialty is torture. You've tortured many men. I'll avenge them. I'll cut you to shreds little by little. I'll torture you to death! You still gonna try to save her? Devil-fire. Viper. Get ready. Let us pass! Hanzo. Don't let them kill you. Remember you're mine. Shobei. As you demand, I'll go unarmed. All right. Come in. What's that? My coffin. You're going to torture me to death, aren't you? You can put me in this later. How considerate. Finally you gave up. A razor without edges. It can't even cut paper. Let go of the girl as you promised. Now, now. You're all right. You know I like women. I'll make her a woman in your presence. Watch me. Look. I see. You're Japan's wickedest thief!. You were born to be cruel. I'll watch you all right. Get them! Come in. We've captured Shobei Hamajima, Japan's worst thief!. On your feet! Away! Well done, Hanzo. You saved the honor of the government. Come. Lord Okubo. Hanzo arrested the thief. As you promised, please forgive his misbehavior and give him a reward. I understand. You fought bravely tonight. I'll reward you. What do you want? Tell me. Anything you want. Do you mean that, sir? I keep my word. Name it, and you'll have it. You can even have a promotion. If you want to work for me, you're welcome. Just name it. Very well. I want the head of Lord Okubo, the treasurer. I want your head. Hanzo! Are you crazy? Shut up! What did you do as treasurer? You made bad coins and squeezed money from the mint. You take bribes too. You're a thief. Worse than Shobei Hamajima. Shut up! Arrest this man! That isn't all. Listen! You sold town girls in Kaizan Temple and got huge amounts of money. Worse than a pimp. Makes you a fine criminal. That's why I want your head. Hanzo, do you have evidence? Two witnesses: The priestess and the mistress of the mint. I came here to get not only the thief but you, too. I wanted evidence. Did he tell the truth? Yes, that's right. I'll give testimony anytime, anywhere, if you want me to. I understand. Lord Okubo. I'll pass this case to the governmental court and examine it with the chamberlains. I want your attendance when this happens. Suit yourself. I'm Lord Okubo. I won't run away. Let's go. Let's go! When he's kneeling at his father's grave, he's as gentle as a kitten. Why did his father have to kill himself?. Because he searched a temple to get a thief without permission. Our master's quickly spending his nine lives too. Look at that. Is that a headstone? It doesn't even come close to one. If he wants to be a good son, he should've gotten some money from Okubo, and - And buy a nice headstone for him. If he'd taken the chance, we'd have been like this. -What? - Rich. He amazes me. What a fool! Hanzo. Lord Okubo has been severely punished. He was released from his position and was ordered to be confined. He lost most of his fief, too. I've become a ronin again. Tough luck. Choose your next employer more carefully. You're skilled. You'll find one. I'll kill you first. It has to be done to keep my pride as a man. That's my priority. I'm a lone wolf. So are you. - Draw. - No! I have to protect the people. I can't risk my life for you. You're standing in my way. Draw. Just draw. You never give up. Fool! THE END
