(dramatic music) - [Narrator] Shaolin Monastery, a famous martial arts temple in ancient China. It was built 1400 years ago. On nearby Munt Song Seng, there's a cave named Dama Cell. Dama was a high monk in the Shaolin monastery who sat in front of a wall, mediating for almost nine years. His shadow, which is shown on the wall, can still be seen today. Inside the Dama Cell, the handwriting on the flat surface of the rock was made by emperor Tung of the Tung dynasty, to permit the kung fu monks of Shaolin Temple to drink and eat meat. This was because the martial arts monk of the shaolin temple once saved the life of emperor Tung. In the martial arts court, there's a mural, showing 500 martial arts monks, poised in many different styles of shaolin kung fu. The most famous are the drunken fists and staff fighting technique. (gong ringing) (rapid drumming) (chanting in foreign language) (monks shouting commands in foreign language) (wooden knocking) - Shaolin is a peaceful place. We practice kung fu only for self defense and to protect our monastery, but we are now being challenged by a Japanese samurai. His name is Lu Shing Ee Po. Although he claims the challenge is for study purposes, I don't think it should be encouraged. I want to refuse his request. What is your opinion on this important matter? - [Both] We agree with you, high priest. (dramatic music) - Are you Lu Shing Ee Po from the branch of Lu Shing? The best soldier in Japan? - Yes. I admire the Chinese martial arts and Shaolin is the very best, so I have come to study for my country. - I will win sword, accept your challenge. (grunting, swords clanging) - I needed the practice. Now I know why. Chinese martial arts has such a good reputation. (dramatic music) - [All] Report, sir! - So you have come back. Have you completed the mission that I gave you? - We just returned from the border, as you instructed, my lord. We carried out the emperor's orders and exterminated the whole of general Hung's family, with one exception. - Except who? - Gah! - Except the general's son, Lau Chung. He got away from us, sir. - What? You damn fool! - [All] Begging your pardon, sir! - You're all a bunch of idiots, you can do nothing! How dare you come back? Go and find him and bring him right back here immediately, do you hear me? Got it? - Yes sir! (dramatic music) (grunting) (swords clanging) (grunting) - Lau Chung, go quickly, I'll stay behind and keep them here. Go on. - No, I won't leave you, we'll die together! (grunting) (swords clanging) - Go on, go quickly, what are you waiting for? - Master, master! - Go on! (grunting) (swords clanging) - Master, master! - Come with me, come on! - Master! Young master, I'm worried about old master. - (mumbles), don't worry, your master, he'll be able to manage it, don't worry. - Someday, I'll kill that Tiger Ko and take revenge for killing my family! - Right, sooner or later, we shall take revenge. We'll do it! (dramatic music) - Ah, tell me, have you seen a Japanese man around? - Uh... No, what does he look like? - Hm, he's my brother, and he's dressed all in black. His name is Lu Shing Ee Po. - I'm sorry, I haven't seen him. (grunting) (crowd murmuring) (dramatic music) - What's a matter? - Put this in right away, hurry up, go on. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (grunting) - You put poison in my food! (swords clanging) (dramatic music) - (mumbles), you can't run away (mumbles)! (swords clanging) (grunting) - Uncle, let's help him escape! - All right! (swords clanging) (grunting) - Uncle, let him go. (dramatic music) (sighing) - It's strange, if they're wounded, they wouldn't be able to go anywhere. - Don't worry, great brother, I don't think they can get away that easily. - We've searched everywhere very carefully, they got to be hiding here somewhere. - Don't argue, we can get 'em after a few drinks. Come on, drink up. - Hey, Yu Chang! - Brother Wang, it's you. - Brother Chang Lu, if you're an officer in the (mumbles), then what are you doing here then? - I'm on an official mission here, but you look rather depressed, is there something wrong? - Let me tell you what's just happened to me. I was ambushing a Japanese samurai with the other kung fu master when suddenly an old man and a youth appeared from nowhere. The Japanese samurai was rescued by these two guy. There was absolutely nothing I could do about the whole situation. - Really, who is this man? His kung fu's remarkable. - The youth is dressed like a noble from a rich family. And the old guy's dressed like a servant, he looked like a dirty beggar, he was dressed all in rags. (laughing) - Mine! (dramatic music) - Kang, he's now awake. - Hey mister, you were drugged. My uncle and I saved your life for you. - Hey, don't move now, you'll be okay. You'll fully recover in just a few days. (dramatic music) - Are you sure this is the place? - I'm sure! (dramatic music) - Brother Chang Loo, there he is! Let's get down there! I've got to get down and take my revenge. - Wait a minute. Don't rush, I promise, I'll retaliate for you. But first we have to look for those two other bastards, the old man and the young guy. They're the ones we have to go after, come on. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Uncle, that Japanese guy is very strange. He left just like that, he didn't say a word and we saved his life. - Maybe he's got something important to do. - Uncle, where are we going? - First, we gotta escape from Tiger Ko's people. When everything is all right, we can recall your father's subordinate and plan how to take revenge. - [Guard] Okay, back up this way now, come on. (dramatic music) - Brother would you be mistaken about this? - Brother Shang Lu. - I wouldn't cheat you. You've just seen that Japanese samurai yourself. - Uncle, let's fight them! - No, we're outnumbered and if we fight, we have no chance. Trying to escape is also foolish. They will find us sooner or later. - Uncle, we can't just sit here, let's fight them! Right now! - Nonsense. Who'll take revenge for your father? If you get killed, then nobody can take revenge. We'll stay here. - Uncle we can't! - Okay, let's run, do as I say, keep going. (dramatic music) - Look. (dramatic music) Come on, let's go. (dramatic music) - Hey you, stop! (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) - Uncle! (swords clanging) (grunting) (screaming) - Search down below now, come on. Where's he gone? - Okay, let's try the other side. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - Wake up, wake up! - [Patron] How can a monk drink like that? (loud gulping) (hiccuping) (mumbles) - (mumbles), please go home, you can come back tomorrow again. (hiccuping) - That was some good drinking, wine, nice day for-- (grunting) My goodness! (slugging) What's this, somebody lying on the ground? Hey, what's wrong? Still breathing. Take a sip of this, it'll do you good. - Monk! - Huh? - What did you give him to drink? (laughing drunkenly) - None of your business. Why you so nervous, is he your husband or something? - Stupid monk, keep your dirty mouth shut. We're not related. I found him lying by the hillside, he was probably hurt seriously, so I went to get him a drink of water. - Oh, I see. He's badly wounded. That's why he's lying here, he's got blood all over him. What should we do? I can save him, I got it! Let me take him back to the monastery, I'll save him there. Go now. (gong ringing) - Tiger Ko, that son of a bitch. In order to grab power in the empire, he took the risk to forge the emperor's edict, to kill all the officials against him. My father, who kept on fighting against him, was finally put to death. Fortunately, I was rescued by my master and uncle. Otherwise, I would also have been killed but the filthy bastard, he didn't give up. He sent numerous assassins to track me down. When he knew that I was still alive, he had to kill me. No matter what he did, and then, his men caught up with us and my master and my uncle were sacrificed, and they were sacrificed trying to save my life. They saved my life. - Buddha have mercy. Tiger Kuois really such a filthy, cruel murderer. - And now, I have nowhere else to go. High priest, will you be kind enough to accept me here? - Buddha has mercy. The Buddha will definitely help the son of the loyal general, that is no problem at all. However, there are only monks who are admitted in the shaolin temple unless you're willing to give up everything. - I'm willing to be a monk and be faithful to Buddha. - Good, good. From now onwards, you're named Wu Lin from Shaolin temple. (laughing) (placid music) (fighters grunting) (strings whipping) (fighters grunting) (shouting) - Master! - Lau Chung, have you never read the shaolin commandment? - Yes, sir, I have. - Then what's the penalty for watching kung fu practice without permission? - 100 strikes of the cane. I'll never do it again. - Rules must be kept. Take him away to the (mumbles). (all protesting) - [Monk] Please let him go. Give him one more chance. - All right, you're forgiven this time, but only once. - Thank you, sir, thank you, master, thank you! - It's all right, on your feet now. I'll request the abbot to let you practice kung fu with the others from tomorrow morning. (all shouting) (powerful music) (grunting) - Lady, how are you? - Tell me, what made you become a monk in the first place? - Well, it's because they only accept monks at shaolin temple, and I wanted to learn kung fu. And I think there's nothing wrong with being a monk. - What are you holding in your hand? - That's wine, I bought it from master Yun Kong. - What? But monks aren't supposed to drink, I thought there was a law against that. (laughing) - Well, I think a little bit won't hurt. Master Yun Kong told me that you had saved my life, is that right? (laughing) - I just happened to be passing by, that's all. - Well, no matter what, I should thank you for saving my life. - Actually, I wasn't the only one there. You should thank your master too. Come on, have some, it's good. - No thank you, you go ahead. - So it's all right for you to drink wine, but yet you won't try any meat? - Lady, it's getting dark, I must get back. - Come on, it's still early, what's your hurry? - I'm sorry, but if I'm late, I'll be punished. I'll see you later. - Wait, don't go, come back! (dramatic music) (swords clanging) (grunting) - Come on, get up! (grunting) - Oh, man, oh, it's painful! - Get up, try again! (slow, dramatic music) - Can I help you? - Where does that path lead to? - That is the library and practice hall. Wait a minute. Outsiders are not allowed in there. - Please, inform the abbot. I'm Lu Shing Ee Po from Japan. I come here to practice king fu. I'll wait for him at the practice hall. - Report to the abbot, a Japanese samurai requests to see you. He wants to practice kung fu with you. - Japanese samurai? Tell me, where is he now? - He's waiting at the practice court. - What do you think, brothers? - Since he's here, we have to face him, let them fight! - [Monk] I agree with you. - Lead the way. - Yeah. (dramatic music) - Behave yourselves, don't be so blind! (swords swiping the air) Mercy, Buddha. What can I do for you, my dear friend? - Lu Shing Ee Po from Japan, I've long admired the martial arts of Shaolin Temple, that is why I've come here. - Mercy, Buddha. The aim of the martial arts is to keep healthy. Besides, I cannot accept your challenge in this monastery. - It's very clear that I come only to practice here, not to fight for fame. No one will get hurt, it will be a peaceful match. Do you understand, a peaceful match. - Yes. - I will represent the abbot, then let's begin. (shouting) (swiping air) (sword clinking) (weapons clanging) (grunting) - Now I understand why the martial art of shaolin is so well known indeed. - Wait a minute! Buddha bless you, you're the best swordsman I've ever seen. - Thank you very much, I will come back again. (slurping) (spitting) - Goddammit, we've been looking for that guy for over a year now, what are we gonna do? - First of all, I suggest we report this back to our master, Tiger Ko. - What? If we go back with nothing, we'll be executed immediately. - But we can't go on like this. - What you say, we got no choice! - Brother, you still think we can't find him? - I don't think he could survive the fall down the mountainside, he'd be dead already. - Maybe you're correct, it's perfect if he is dead then, it'll save us a lot of time. But what if he's not? We have to keep looking for him whether he's alive or dead, so let's not waste any more time, come on. (ethereal music) (comical music) - You're an idiot. - Misanna! (both grunting) Misanna, please believe me, I didn't mean to do that, really! - Shut up, I don't believe you, you've been self denying it. (grunting) - Misanna, please stop it. - You're a lousy crook. (grunting) - This monk looks familiar. - I'm never gonna let you get away from me. - That's him! Hold it, let's take it easy now. (grunting) - Even if you can make it back to the monastery, you can bet I'll be right behind you! Come back here! - He's hiding in the Shaolin Temple and has now become a monk, huh? - He's going, let's get him! We can't attack the monastery. We better report back to Tiger Ko first, come on, let's do that, okay? (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (tense music) (dramatic music) - Who are you? (grunting) (groaning drunkenly) Master Yun Kung, it's very late now, you're still drinking? - Kid, whenever you find happiness, enjoy yourself. Drink for today and forever, hey kid! What are you doing here anyway, hey? - Oh, nothing sir, I couldn't get to sleep so I took a walk. - You're trying to cheat me, ain't ya? I ain't stupid, ya know. - That's not true, master, I always tell the truth. - You're lying, mate, you wanna get out of here and take revenge, ain't that right? Tell me the truth, come on, speak up, tell me! Don't lie! - Please forgive me! (shouting) (laughing) (groaning) - You're not good enough to fight against Tiger Ko, he's much better than you are. You'll be killed if you challenge him, now, go back to sleep. (hiccuping) - Oh, the guy who passed me on the road with the mask, that was you, master! (swords clanging) (grunting) - What a good fighter! - Master, I'm sorry-- (all talking over one another) (tense music) - How dare you violate this place? Don't be a coward, show yourself immediately. (dramatic music) - [All] My lord Tiger Ko. - It's all of you then. - [Ninja] We wanna speak with (mumbles), my lord. (chuckling darkly) - My dear friend, what brings you all here? What do you want with me? - We've simply come to donate a precious present to you, my lord. Here's the gift. - Hm, take it inside. - Sir. - That's very generous of you, please get up. - My lord, that's the least we can do. Please don't mention it. I hope you would like our little gift, we'd like to thank you for giving us the chance to make a fortune along the seashore. - Don't mention it. - Huh, huh? Is there something bothering you, my lord? - Please, you're my guests here, don't bother yourself. I can take care of it. (sighing) - My lord, please tell us, we wanna serve you in any way we can. - If you insist. Take a look at this, he's the son of an opponent of mine. He's now hiding in the Shaolin Temple. That is why I'm quite worried. - You've got no need to worry about that, we'll get into the Shaolin Monastery and get him back for you, sir. (dramatic music) - Who's there? Stay where you are and don't move! (dramatic music) - How dare you intrude into the Shaolin Temple? (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (swords clanging) (grunting) - What else can you do now, huh? (punches landing) (grunting) (explosion blasting) Strange. Huh? Japanese ninja, what are they doing here? (feet pattering) - Hold it, you lousy crooks, how dare you come to steal at Shaolin Temple? Put it down at once! (grunting) (punches landing) (explosion blasting) What the hell's going on? (all exclaiming) (dramatic music) (all exclaiming) - Ah, now I see, they came to take him back. - You lousy idiots. Your Japanese martial arts, a ninja technique, are not as good as you told me. - We are very sorry, the Shaolin monks were tougher than we thought they'd be. (laughing) - That's bullshit, I just don't believe that they're really indestructible. Chang Lu Long Pi. - [All] Yes! - Take action immediately, let's fight our way into the shaolin temple. (dramatic music) (swords clanging) (grunting) - Stop it! Don't be impolite. (swords swiping) Mercy, Buddha. What brings the royal Tiger Ko to our shaolin temple? What can I do for you? I apologize for my students' rudeness. - That's quite all right. Today, I come here only to look for a prisoner called Hung Chee Yan, have you accepted him into your monastery? - Mercy, Buddha. I really don't understand what you're talking about. Shaolin Monastery is a place of Buddha and we accept no prisoners here. Please believe me, my royal Tiger Ko. I can guarantee that there is nobody called Hung Chee Yan here. (laughing) - Your explanation sounds all right, it's reasonable, too. But according to my investigation, Hung Chee Yan is surely hiding in the Shaolin Monastery. Will the abbot let me search the place? And let me satisfy my own curiosity. - All right, but, have you brought the orders from his majesty? - My words are the orders, if you don't bring him out, I'm going to search everywhere and I will destroy. Come on. (grunting) (clapping) (swiping air) (grunting) (swiping air) Quite good. Get back. Listen, I'll give you 10 days to surrender Hung to me, otherwise I'll come back to tear your Shaolin Monastery to the ground! Go! (murmuring) (dramatic music) - He's going back (mumbles). (mellow music) Abas! Would you fill this up for me? It's for our master, Yun Kong. Here. (dramatic music) (mumbles) (shouting) (dramatic music) (swords clanging) (grunting) - Report to your highness, Hung Chee Yang is just over there! - Very good. (swords clanging) (grunting) (chuckling wickedly) - So you thought you could get away from me after becoming a monk, did you? Well, you're wrong. (chuckling) (grunting) (blows landing) - You shut up. Don't be so insolent in front of our mercy Buddha! - You swine, how dare you say that? (grunting) (blows landing) (mystical noises) (grunting) - Come on! - Wait a minute! (tense music) (powering up humming) (both grunting) - Master Yung! (all shouting) - Help him up. (mumbles) Take him back. (panting) (dramatic music) (sizzling) - [Lau] I'm sorry, master Yun Kong. If you didn't fight with Tiger Ko, you wouldn't have been hurt. I really feel sorry. (panting) - That's all right. I've almost helped Yun Kung recover from his wounds. He's safe now, but he can't move for the moment. Woo Yin, take master Yun Kung to the breath chamber right. (dramatic music) (mellow music) (knocking) (all exclaiming and laughing) - Please be quiet, everybody! (all chuckling knowingly) I know her. - [Monk] Whoa, who is she? - She's a friend of Yu Yin. (all exclaiming knowingly) Hey, I'll tell you, let's go over there and (mumbles). - Yeah! - Come on! - Hi, lady, what are you doing here, huh? - I'm just waiting here for Lau Chung. (all exclaiming knowingly) Well, why isn't he here with you? - He's busy, lady, you have no need to wait. He won't come out this time, really he won't. - But why not? - He's now staying with master Yun Kung in the breath chamber, understand? (all chuckling) - Well, tell me, do you know how long he'll be staying in there? - Oh, we have no idea. - Lady, why do you have to wait for brother Lau Chung, why can't you ever wait for some of us? We can help you! (all laughing and exclaiming) (shouting playfully) - Buddha, have mercy, what's wrong with all of you over there, you idiots? What do you think you're doing? (gasping, all apologizing) Goodness. I apologize for what they just did. Will you please excuse their disrespect towards you? I'm terribly sorry. - Hmph! (swiping air) (grunting) - You bastard! - I'm sorry, master! - How could you do this to your brothers? - I'm very sorry, I won't do it again! (swiping air) (grunting) - I have a very important message for his highness. The three Japanese samurais have brought a stranger with them. - Bring them in. - Bring the stranger in. - Bring them in. - Bring them in. - Bring them in! (dramatic music) - [All] The royal Tiger Ko. - [Red Ninja] (mumbles) us compensate for our guilt. We've been (mumbles) a top Japanese samurai. Mr. Lu Shing Ee Po. - We'll work for you and help you get that bastard. - Hm. (dramatic music) (wings flapping) - Very good technique, welcome. (dramatic music) (swiping air) - Master. - Hello again. What kind of staff fighting are you doing? (hiccupping) - Master, it's a kind of active staff fighting you taught me before, don't you remember? - No, no, that's not an active staff fighting technique. You're completely wrong. (hiccuping) if you practice like that, you won't improve at all. Okay, Lau Chung, give me the staff, give it to me! (dramatic music) Now I'll show you exactly the pattern of active staff fighting! Watch this. (staff cutting air) (grunting) - Master, you're drunk! - You know, I only look drunk. - What's that, he looks drunk? Drunken staff! (swiping air) - Brother Yu and Ko, the 10 days training is almost up now. How is Lau Chung getting along, has he improved? - He's improved very quickly, now I think he's pretty strong, even Tiger Ko can't defeat him so easily. - Oh, good, hm. - Master Yu Yin Kong, that's good news. As I see it, he's become the best kung fu fighter in the Shaolin Monastery, he's almost perfect now. (chuckling) High priest, do you agree with us that (mumbles) his lessons now? (dramatic music) - You bastard, we've been waiting for you! - Well, I've been waiting for you! (swords clanging) (grunting) (explosion blasting) (swiping air) (grunting) - Good morning. - Good morning! You come again, how are you? - I'm fine. Where's Lau Chung? Is he still in the monastery? - No, he's gone, he left early this morning. - What? He's gone already? But I thought that he just went to get some wine for his master. - No, he didn't do that, he's gone to challenge Tiger Ko. (dramatic music) - What's that? He's gone to challenge Tiger Ko? - Hey, lady, where are you going? I've got something to tell you! (dramatic music) (swiping air) (grunting) (dramatic hissing) (explosion blasting) (hissing) (swords clanging) (grunting) - Master! (mumbles) (swords clanging) (grunting) (blipping) (laughing) - Stupid kid, what are you looking for? She's gone. - Huh? (dramatic music) - Mr. Lu Shing, you see? That's all you can manage to do, but I still respect your spirit. (laughing) Especially the Japanese swordsmanship. Mr. Lu Shing, he's all yours. Go ahead and take him, be my guest. (dramatic music) (weapons clanging) (grunting) - So it's you! (dramatic music) - You really want to fight with us? (weapons clanging) (grunting) Hold on! - I'm sorry, Tiger Ko, I really can't kill this man for you. - Why not? - None of your business. (laughing wickedly) - Don't worry, I don't need your help, I can handle him all on my own. Come on! (shouting) (weapons clanging) (grunting) - Lau Chung, the principle jewel strip! - Yes, master! (weapons clanging) (grunting) Master! (weapons clanging) (grunting) Master! (grunt of pain) (weapons clanging) (grunting) (blows landing) (grunting) Drunken staff! (dramatic music) (drunken mumbling) (weapons clanging) (grunting) - God damn it! (weapons clanging) (grunting) - This is known as the lightening fists techniques! - I don't care what you call it! (weapons clanging) (grunting) - This is the electric fist technique. Hey! (weapons clanging) (grunting) How do you feel now, huh? Ready to give up yet, huh? (weapons clanging) (grunting) That is known as the powerful thunder kicks. (weapons clanging) (grunting) This method is called the raging bull punch. (weapons clacking (grunting) (grunt of pain) (dramatic bell ringing) (triumphant music)
