[INTERPOSING VOICES] Oh, you don't want to say goodbye to us. Is that it? [CHILDREN PLAYING] [EERIE MUSIC] It doesn't matter where you'll go. You will always be a loser. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC] Matt, is that you, bud? Yeah. Hey, remember that video cord we were looking for? I think I found another-- let me see. Jeez. Come on. Can I take my amp out? Sure. All right, man. What happened? Martin. Hm. Same as always, hm? Hm-hm. Tomorrow, it'll be better. How does moving make it better? Well, new town, new people. Maybe we can get a fresh start. Sounds pretty good to me, right? Yeah. But listen, God has a plan for us, bud. We might not see it. And we might not know what it is. But there's something there. OK? OK. And this is no good. But moving tomorrow, we still got something to look forward to. Hm-hm. OK? OK. All right, it's you and me, bud. We can do it. OK? I love you. I know. OK. Get out of here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bye, mom. Come on, buddy. You got it? Yup. All right. Got it. Here. Give me that. All right, go grab the box in the trunk. Yeah, OK. The little one, not the big one. I got the big one, all right? OK. Hey, dad? What, buddy? Did you see that weird kid outside? What weird kid? The one riding the bike. I didn't see any bike riding weird kids. Huh. OK. Why, who is he? I don't know. He just was on his bike. And he was staring at me. Is he still out there? I don't know. I think may have left after I stopped looking at him. All right, whatever. Oh, jeez. Hello. Hi, my mom said I should bring you guys some dinner, so I brought you some pizza. Hey, Matt, that weird kid's here. Thanks for this. Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] Hi. Sorry I was daydreaming earlier. It was kind of weird. Yeah. I haven't got that much sleep lately. Well, I'm DJ. I'm Matt. So, thanks for the pizza. Yup. You're welcome. What's up? Oh, what's up? What's happening? I'm Aaron, Matt's dad. I'm DJ. Nice to meet you, DJ. Nice to meet you. What are you guys talking about? I don't even know actually. OK. I was kind of thinking that we could like hang out some time? Maybe tomorrow? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds great. That would be cool. Yup. OK. Yeah. I mean, we're just getting settle tonight. But, yeah. OK. Mid-afternoon tomorrow if you want to come by, that'd be great. Yup, that's be great. Yup. That'll be amazing. All right, man. All right, see you guys. Yup, see you tomorrow. Yup, latch over there. See you. Cool. All right, there you go. We just made a new friend. How about that? That's pretty sweet, right? Yeah. Yeah. I say we eat that pizza? Get ice cream? No, we're not going to get ice cream. Maybe. We will eat that pizza, and then we will get the rest of the boxes. What do you think? Sounds great. OK. The only problem is I have this really weird thing on my shoulder, and I need you to get it for me. Can you do that? [MUSIC PLAYING] Got your amp in? Yeah. So what do you think, buddy? Pretty nice when you get settled in, huh? Yeah. It's fine, I guess. You don't like it, or what? No. I like it. I'm just worried. Worried? You just got a new house and made a new friend in the same day. What could you be worried about? You know there are big bullies here, too, right? Maybe. But like we've talked about before, bullies aren't complicated. They just need understanding and forgiveness. That's all. I know. Can I ask you something kind of serious? OK. Are we here to forget about mom? What? I just wanted it to be like at the old house. Mattie, just because we go somewhere or do something different-- I mean, yeah, it's fresh start. It's a new house. It's a new town and all that. But we're never going to forget about mom no matter where we go. OK? OK. That should never be something you feel like you have to worry about. All right? God has a plan for us, bud, even if we don't see it. OK? OK. But you look super tired. So what do you say we call it a night, huh? No, I'm not tired. Yes, you are tired. You're super tired. But are you OK? Hm-hm. Get some sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Love you. All right. There's you man, all right. Dad, dad. Hey, DJ. Hey. You ready? Yeah, I'm ready. All right. Hey dad, we're going out. OK, see you. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] So [INAUDIBLE], huh? What? Don't you have your thing in? Oh, I'm sorry. You have to speak through my right ear. It's hard for me to hear out of my left ear. OK. Are the amps really expensive? I don't know. Oh. I thought that's why you don't have two. No. I'm almost completely deaf in my left ear. Really? Really. So if there were to be a really loud noise in your left ear, you wouldn't hear it? Yup. Pretty much. So if I were to-- Just do it. You sure? I'm sure. OK. Hey! Did you hear that? What? Sorry. Did you hear that? Dude, I can't hear you. What? I can't hear you. OK. Ha, ha. No. I'm not joking. I can't hear you, not even through my good ear. Seriously, dude? I'm serious! I can't hear! Dude. I'm sorry, dude. I can't hear. I did not mean to-- I am very-- I don't-- I am sorry, dude. It's OK. It's OK. I know-- I know you didn't mean it. What? Got you! Oh my gosh. It's so hot out. OK, that's it. Ah! Dude, what are you doing? I'm swimming! You're not supposed to swim here! Who cares? The sign cares. Well, I don't. You should come in. I am not going in there. It's refreshing. Fine. But you better get out of there soon. Hey, idiots! Can't you guys read? The sign says no swimming. Dude, who is that kid? He's the new kid. Who are you? Who? Matt. He just moved in. Don't worry about this dude. It's going to be hilarious. Want to see a magic trick? Wait more, Devin! Shut up, DJ, or your next! Sure? Watch closely. Dude. Why did you do that? Oh, dude. Oh my goodness. Are you going to take that? Listen, new kid. That wasn't the trick. See how dry you are? Don't! Take that, new kid! Dude, he pushed him. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. Now, Matt, was it? Let's be honest with each other. You're a loser just like your friend DJ over there. And if I ever see you near me or my lake ever again, you're dead. Did it get your amp wet? What? Hey, dude. It could have been way worse. Sometimes, when I step through him, he gets pretty scared. Sure. Don't be upset. He nearly broke my amp. Yeah, but he didn't. That's good? I guess. My house tomorrow? Sure. OK, see you. See you. Whoa. Hey, thanks for taking Matt out today. No problem. Everything all set? Yup. All right. Tomorrow, stay dry. OK? All right. And you, young man, tripping and falling in the lake. Stand up. Can I take my amp out? OK. All right, buddy. So I suspect you didn't trip, did you? No. No. Was it DJ? No? Was some mean kids? It wasn't my fault. OK. This kid named Devin threw DJ's clothes in the water. And I told him it wasn't right. Then he pushed me in. OK, son. What was I supposed to do? OK. I'm not saying that you did the wrong thing. I'm just saying that if you got pushed in the lake for it, maybe-- I don't know. Maybe something could have been different. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying-- You didn't see what he was like. All right, you're right. I didn't see him. And I'm sorry. Me, too. You OK? All right. [MUMBLING] Stop. Stop. Mom. [MUSIC PLAYING] What does your dad do? Teacher-- seventh grade math. Oh, that sucks. Why? I don't know. I just thought you would agree with me. No. It's fine. So what does your dad do? CPA. What's that? It's like accounting, money and stuff. Oh. Hey, Matt. Yeah? What happened to my mom? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. She died two years ago. Oh. Wow. I kind of feel like a jerk. It's OK. She was really sick. Sometimes my dad said it was for the best. Here you go. So where's your mom? She-- sorry. She's like alive and stuff. She moved in with my old wrestling coach. Oh. Yeah, it's weird. Hey, Matt? Yeah? Want to sleep over my house tonight? I'll have to ask. I haven't hung out with my dad much this week. It's OK, whatever you want to do. Hey. What? I have an idea. Hey, YouTube. I know my last video got taken down by some government censures. Wait, what? But we're back with another video. Look at my assistant, Matt, who's going to have an apple shot off of his head. DJ, I don't want to do this, dude. No, ladies and gentlemen, he definitely wants to do this. DJ, I don't want to do this. All right, ready? DJ, stop! Aim! Come on DJ! You're going to shoot me in the face! Fire! You know, buddy, as much as I love cleaning you up, I think maybe-- hold this here. I think maybe we need to take a break from this stuff. Dad, it's not as bad as it looks. DJ just hit me in the face with a Nerf arrow. I'm sure he did. And I can see it all on YouTube, right? Most likely. Yes. Of course, I can. Give me that. Listen, I know DJ is a nice kid and everything. And he wants to be your friend. But look at me. You just need to be careful, all right? OK. No more arrows to the face. No promises. Yeah, right. Get out of here. Hey. Go. Love you. Love you, dad. Love you to, buddy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bro, you know that kid the other day? That kid was a loser. Dude, that new kid? I think that's the one it was, yeah. Yeah, dude, that kid was such an idiot. Yeah. But hold up, I got a joke. Why are chefs so mean? Because they beat the eggs, and they whip the cream. It's funny, right? Shut up. All right, so back up. That guy, he was like crazed. Like did you see me push him in? Dude, that was insane. That was awesome. OK. So this could either be a really great idea or a really bad idea. It's a bad idea. Hey, don't you want to get them back for pushing us in the lake? I thought you were scared of Devin. Me? No way, dude. I'm not afraid of anyone. Hm-hm. OK. Maybe a little. My mom said it's my coping mechanism. Hand me a balloon. Ah! What? Dude, what was that? Oh my- Hand me the bucket. Come on. All right, Devin, let's see how you like this. Dude! Oh, dude. What is this? Ew, what is that? Oh my God. This is not funny! This is disgusting! That was great. That was great. Yeah, that was cool. I've got to go clean my room or my mom's going to kill me. It's going to be about an hour. Want to meet me at the lake? I thought we were supposed to go there anymore. Devin won't bother us. Are you sure? I'm sure. OK. See you. See you. Got you. What's your problem? My problem? You poured crap on me. Stop being a [INAUDIBLE]! OK. Come on. Who do you think you are? I'm-- I'm just trying to understand. What are you talking about, weirdo? I just-- I should have-- You think you can just come here and be Mr. Big Shot? I-- You can't. Devin-- You can't. I just moved here. DJ wanted to be my friend. Shut up. Why are you so mad at me? Who do you think you are? You're no one. I'm the one. I own you. Does that make your dad nice to see you? What? Devin, you probably don't know how it feels. But I get bullied a lot. You think I don't get bullied? What do you know, deaf kid? My dad hates me. I'm sure he doesn't hate you. You're just like everybody else. All you do is just sit here and tell me that I'm bad because my dad hits me. Dads shouldn't do that. Wow. You must be a genius. Everyone knows. I'm sure he's probably already in jail again anyway. Devin, before I moved here I was bullied a lot. And especially after my mom died, I was really angry. Your mom died? Yeah. Cancer. Car crash. Guess we have something in common. Guess so. I don't want tell you what to do anything. But bullying people won't help. It just makes other people hurt, too. I know. It's my problem. I'm sorry I hurt you. I forgive you. You shouldn't. I've done really bad things to you. Devin, I've done some bad things, too. It's just the way it is. What's your point? I'm tired of fighting. OK? So I forgive you. Did you learn that at Sunday school? I guess. That's stupid. Hey, new kid, you OK? I'm OK. Hey, dad, I have something to tell you. What's up, buddy? Who did that to you? Um. Was it that kid from the lake? I sweat-- Dad. Dad. --to-- Dad, it's OK. I know-- Dad, it's OK. --that I should've called his parents. I handled it! You-- you handled it? Yes. Look at your face. You did not handle this, bud. Dad! This is really serious. Dad! This is not-- I'm calling. I did! I handled it! Why do you think I can't do anything myself? What are you talking about? Matt, let me help you. Mattie, talk to them or run away. I can't do this. I can't do that. You act like I'm a little baby! Matthew, that is enough! No, dad! You don't know how hard everything is for me! Matt. Bud, it's been really hard for me, too. Oh, really? You haven't even cried once since mom died. You haven't even cried once! Where is this coming from right now? Where is this coming from? Where is this coming from? You don't care about mom. You don't care about her. You-- you-- you know what? I don't care? This whole thing, everything that we did, I have done everything for you, so that you could start over. You think I'm not upset? My wife is dead. You think that I'm not upset about that? I am. I don't care? Why do you think we're here? You're a kid. You don't know a thing. I heard about you and Devin. Yeah. I don't know what you did, but Devin, he told everybody to leave us alone. That's cool. Hey, Matt? I didn't know he was waiting for you. What do you mean? The whole you and Devin, thing? It's kind of my fault. Well, it's not. It's-- I understand if you don't want to be friends anymore. Why? It's just-- I don't usually-- DJ, what are you talking about? Kids at my school, they just-- they always think I'm annoying. And I just don't want you to feel like that. Well, you are pretty crazy. Sorry. But you know what? Crazy's good sometimes. I can't believe it's only been a week. Been a cool week. I promise you it's not always like this. I've had worse. What you thinking about? Honestly, I think we're going to be OK. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC]
