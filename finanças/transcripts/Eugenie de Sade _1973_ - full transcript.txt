She died two days after giving birth to me. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ It's late. You should be going to bed. I love to see you work. [chuckles] [Eugenia] My stepfather was a renowned writer, misunderstood by the public at large, but a great writer, nonetheless. He had brought me up with care and devotion, and I had come to acquire anunreasoned admiration for him. Since his creative work didn't meet with the success it deserved, he took refuge in essays, book reviews, and, fortunately, well-paid conferences, living in the hope that some day his real worth would be widely recognized. He dreamed of being carried in triumph. These past few years his interest focused mainly on eroticism- on erotic writers, on erotic traditions throughout the world, throughout the ages. He also studied all the sciences involved with eroticism. I often stayed alone in our big house, dreaming, waiting for my stepfather to come back. The sound of his footsteps on the stairs made me jump for joy. I often went on long walks, thinking about him, about his work, about our quiet and peaceful life. ♪ ♪ When I felt lonely, I'd rummage through his well-stocked library, sure that I would find some new book to read, or perhaps an old, rare edition of an erotic book which had survived many generations, and had become a classic. "Oh, her breasts pressing against my chest! Oh, her eager mouth! Her sex opening like a flower before my own. Her look... in which pain and pleasure were so intimately entwined so as to be undistinguishable. A bloody string of pearls graced her neck, dropping one by one on my body, each leaving a stain upon it. The gaping wound in her chest." Uh. How are you, darling? What are you reading? Uh... oh, "A Barbarian in Asia." Oh. Do you like it? [laughs] No. Not really. [Eugenia] I'll never forget the first time snow fell that winter. As if by some enchantment, everything became white, neat, unreal, strange. Father had gone into town. He came back earlier than usual. I'd curled up on the couch before the fireside, my body vibrating, responding to a bizarre feeling- a mixture of well-being and apprehension. ♪ ♪ Eugenia... ...I noticed that while I was gone this morning... ...you took the book that I had hidden there. I did. How did you find out? There's nothing to it. I left it standing this way... ...and I found it standing that way. Are you mad I read it? No... ...on the contrary. It's high time you read such things. I think so, too. You did like it, I hope. More than anything I've read in my whole life. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Eugenia] I never would have imagined that our conversation could end this way. I felt as if I'd been jolted into another form of reality, and better yet, that I'd had the revelation of my father's true nature. I felt that he had put himself within my reach. We had created a form of complicity. [breathing heavily] Yes, that's exactly what it was- complicity. I was my father's accomplice, allowed to share with him things that I thought were forbidden. I didn't sleep well at all that night. I got up at dawn and went out for a long walk. I strode through the snowwith deliberately large steps, my head empty of thought, as if I were trying to shake off the feeling which had made me so ill at ease the night before. By the time I came home at around noon, my father had left the house. He'd left a message for me on his desk. "I'll be coming home late tonight. Read this book, which I personally found quite interesting. I'm certain you won't be bored." "Eugenia had opened her eyes. Before her stood her father, who had surreptitiously come into her room. She was naked, and she knew that her small, pointed breasts often caught his eye. That's why she offered them to her father's lips as he knelt by the bedand began to bite her nipples, his desire showing,as his hand sought out her sex- fresh, wet. His caresses made her realize for the first time that she had become a woman and now, at this very moment, her father was but a man, breathing hard with desire, a Machiavellic look in his eyes." Eugenia, you've just discovered life's deepest purpose; the quest for the grail mankind has sought throughout the ages; ultimate power over human beings. Yes, the power which comes from the pleasure of giving pain, living each moment with intensity and awareness while they suffer. You'll find out that the key to life is nothing but your own pleasure. You'll be amazed to find out that pleasure is always at someone else's expense. We'll carry this to its ultimate expression through wounds and blood and death. I know you'll love every moment of it. You'll revel in the secret knowledge of having done something savagely beautiful, but forbidden. I accept. I'll do absolutely anything you want me to do- anything you say. Your will will be mine. We'll act as one. I had a premonition... ...that life would be full of passions. Oh, it's marvelous what we've become to each other. Father, I promise to obey you. I'm going to Paris tomorrow for an important conference. I'm going to take advantage of the occasion to commit the perfect crime... ...and I know it's possible. There is a secret in committing the perfect crime and it's absence of any visible motive. We won't have any visible motive in as much as we won't know who our victim is until chance puts her in our way. We're going to pick our model, one of those girls who pose naked for amateurs photographing artistic nudes, poor imbeciles. There are quite a few such joints in Brussels. We'll rent one and take whatever model they give us. They'll pick our victim for us. Another important thing is making sure the witnesses end up totally confused. The way we'll do it is simple. We will simply not try to hide. No one ever sees the obvious. Acting in the open is the best cover. Real killers always try to cover up their tracks, but they always miss a clue that gives them away. We, on the other hand, will make sure we are seen. [bus approaching] [discordant music ♪] [Eugenia] I'd never taken such a long trip before, but that's not why I felt sostrangely overcome by emotion. The Eiffel Tower and the Champs-EÉlysées were nothing but mere backdrops to the adventure which was about to begin. Father was silent, too, but I knew he felt the same excitement I did. Hey, how are you? Can I help you? I reserved a room. My name is Mr. Radeck. Oh, yes, of course. Here's your key, Mr. Radeck. Thank you. Maybe you'd like to freshen up a bit? [Eugenia] A few people were waiting for us at the hotel; friends, newspapermen, somebody from the publisher's office, people like that. - Could I have five minutes of your time? As soon as I've said hello to my friends. Oh, sure. Take your time. Maybe we could meet at the bar. Sure. I'll join you as soon as I can. I'm going up. Why don't you rest a while? I'm sorry, I won't have much time to spare. What newspaper did you say you work with? The Gazette. - The what? Do you mind if I take a picture of you in the lobby? I'd rather be photographed reading one of my own books. That way I know what I'm reading and the quality I'm absorbing. [sighs] Who's there? Albert. You can come in. Did you reserve a table at the nightclub? Darling, of course I did. At the Taboo. Just in time to catch the show. I hear it's the best in Paris these days. Does that suit you? It suits me fine.

[chatter] [Eugenia] We took the last plane back to Paris, and made it back to the nightclub. It was late, but the show wasn't over yet. A man who thought he was a comic was putting on the worst act I had ever seen. Now tell me, why should a musician play bang cymbals in the middle of the zoo? "Bang," he says, "they don't like the trombone." "How do you know?" I said. "Well," he said, "when the monkeys like it, they throw me whole bananas, and when they don't, they throw the peels. That's how I know." [Eugenia] No one paid any attention to us. [comedian] Why are you laughing? It ain't funny. No one seemed to have missed us and most anybody probably would have sworn we'd spent the whole evening in the club. All right. I'll pick up the story where I left off. So, there was this idiot blowing cymbals, bang, bang, bab-ba-bang, moving like this... [Eugenia] I was glad we left before the show. I don't think I could have sat through it. Well, the audience had had its fun and we'd had ours. ♪ Ba ba boom ♪ ...like cymbals, and everyone knows that they throw you fish, you know. [laughs] I was gonna ask him if his name wasn't Ionesco, by any chance. This woman comes up and she gives him a coin. "There," he said, "that's the seal of approval." [Eugenia] The whole thing was much like a game. A few hours later, we were attending a cocktail party at my father's French publishing house. The women hovered around my father like a bunch of silly bees. I was terribly jealous. Hello there. You look like a Madonna by some Florentine painter. Maybe even an earlier painter; Guadalupe, for example. Maybe a Flemish master like Rogier van der Weyden. Would you be so kind? - Of course. Would you care for a glass of scotch, Mr. Radeck? Thank you. To your health. Cheers. Whom should I autograph it to? My name's Louise Schlantopovich. [giggling] You're not listening, are you? Ah, the mystery that is woman. Such eyes: limpid yet enigmatic. Women are such an unfathomable mystery until you lift their many masks. Of course some women, if you lift their mask, you decapitate them. Not you. I can tell there's genuine mystery about you. Excuse me. Sure. I'm aware of that. Just a moment, please. Are you talking to me? Yes, that's right. You're Eugenia Radeck, and I know many things about you and your father. What do you mean? Oh, no, nothing special. However, I'd like to have a chance to talk a little with your father. Tell him I'm inviting you home for a drink; a cocktail. He's a fascinating writer and I'd like to get to know him a little better. Why don't you talk to him here? - Here? Oh, no, I hate crowds and I'm not dressed for the occasion. I hate putting on a tie, you see. Please try to set it up, would you? I know I can count on you. I'm Attila Tanner. You're Attila Tanner, the famous writer? That's what they say. I'll see to it that my father accepts. I am certainly glad that you accepted my invitation. I'd like to tell you that I've read all your books. That's right. I've been following your career and admiring you for many years. Hmm, I'm flattered. I feel quite rewarded by the fact that a man such as you should be interested in my modest endeavors. I never would have believed it. Would you have me believe that you consider your work as insignificant? You're highly intelligent, and you know it. Here's your drink. You've got me cornered if I admit that I'm intelligent. I'd sound pretentious, isn't that right? And, if, on the contrary, I should protest, I'd sound like a hypocrite. But you are. I beg your pardon. Here's to your success. Yes, you are a hypocrite. It happens that I know you better than you think. Yes, I know you've read all my books and likely all my essays. You're quite right and I know you inside out. Here, you once wrote in "The Black Arts," chapter three, "Only awareness of the harshness of natural laws can detract us from the powerful influence of black magic." What's hypocritical about that? But, in "Necromicon" you write, "By the very virtue of its immense power black science... ...can draw you all the way into... ...demonic life." So when were you sincere? In the first case or in the second? In both cases. You're aware that "Necromicon" was written five years ago, while I wrote "Black Arts" when I was 20 or so. I've changed a bit. You mean the man you are changed radically between the two books? It's obvious. I'm a man of many minds, and should you care to look at yourself, so are you, Tanner. From what you just said, I may conclude that you lead a demoniacal life. I also tend to conclude you make your daughter share it. So what? It bothers you? Why should it? But what about the law? Are you referring to the natural law? Well, I was thinking of man-made laws- laws made to impose some form of social order. What about you, Mr. Tanner? Were you never tempted to transgress those laws? Of course I was, but it never went beyond the state of wishful thinking. I'm only an intellectual. I don't indulge in wishful thinking. It's been said that mankind is divided into two main categories: those who submit to the circumstances of life, and those who act. Among the latter are those who think first, and that doesn't stop them from acting afterward. The others act by instinct and stop to think after the action. That's the major difference, but they're both men of action. The world of tomorrow belongs to us. And you, Mr. Radeck, I suppose that you act only after thinking things out thoroughly. Does your daughter think as you do? Passionately. Then I suppose that you, let's say, collaborate closely with your father. - Yes. - I see. I often wondered about the nature of your relationship. Ah. I should have guessed. But I tend to beware of my imagination. My mind plays the weirdest tricks on me. That's why I'm glad you clued me in. We didn't tell you anything, Mr. Tanner. No, of course. You didn't come out and say you were lovers. But I'm warning you that from this moment on... ...I'm going to keep a close watch on you and everything you do. I must say I'm very much interested in your schemes. There's nothing unhealthy or moralistic about my curiosity. A writer needs to dip into genuine, extravagant characters to add texture to his own. You can watch us 'til your heart's content. [Eugenia]Father decided we'd drive back. The trip turned out to be very pleasant. We drove very slowly. Father looked almost happy. He was boiling over with energy. I'd never seen him that way before. The people we met along the way probably thought we were a newly married couple on a honeymoon. Was there anything in the newspapers? Did they run a story about it yet? Yes, but they didn't say much. "A photo joint model murdered, tortured." The suspects are described as "a bizarre couple dressed in red." That's all? It's working out exactly as you said. [laughs] How could it have been otherwise? I spent years figuring out everything, working out every detail. No one will ever find out we did it. Impunity. We can do whatever we want with a total impunity. And Tanner? Oh yes, Tanner. Huh. He's a harmless maniac. What do you think? I'm not so sure. He's intelligent. A highly refined intelligence. He's much like us. He understands us. ♪ ♪ In the days that followed... - Yes? ...our complicity... [exhales] ...deepened. I was so glad. I was happy. Papers were devoting less and less space to the murder. The Belgian police were following all sorts of false leads. ♪ ♪ And yet... ...on my long, lonely walks, I kept on seeing the dead woman's face. ♪ ♪ At night it sometimes came to haunt my dreams. When it did I crawled into bed with my father, and cuddled up against him. ♪ ♪ Why don't you get some sleep, Father? No, not just yet. I won't be long, though. By the way, would you rather I went on calling you "Father"? Or would you like me to call you "Albert"? Ah. [laughs] That's funny. You know, nobody ever called me Albert except your mother. You never told me how Mother died. I told you darling, she died a couple of days after giving you birth. Yes, but you never told me how. That's true. And today you've got a right to know the truth. It's a sordid tale. I had to wait 'til you were born so I could kill her. Does it horrify you? I simply wanted to know. If I had known her it might have been different. Do you mind telling me why you did it? I had found out that she was cheating on me, and I'd been suffering the pains of hell for some time. I can't bear treason. I can't bear it. But I waited... ...because of you. I wanted you. I knew I'd have a girl and I had to wait to see you were born. The rest was easy. My life changed entirely when you were born, and there was no part in it for her. If you thought I'd been untrue to you, would you kill me? I'd do worse than that. But I wouldn't survive you. I'd kill myself. I'd kill myself because nothing in the world would matter anymore. I'd commit hara-kiri. It's the only way of killing yourself if you want to die with dignity. Forgive me. Now let's talk about those plans I made. How 'bout it? Oh, yes. Tell me all about them. Let's do something different this time and have fun doing it. [Eugenia] The occasion turned up quite unexpectedly within a few days. We'd gone to see some movie in a nearby town and were driving back home early in the evening... ...when suddenly, I saw a girl standing on the side of the road trying to thumb a ride. Did you see her? [laughing] Oh, my nose tells me you're going to Hamburg, am I right? - Yes, you are. - I knew it! Oh, sit in front. There's room for three. She was Austrian- a student, and an utter idiot. She was tickled pink to have run into us, and told us so effusively. You look like such nice people. How lucky can a girl get? I usually get picked up by creeps, or at least they try, but no go. I wait for some nice people like you to come along, and this time I didn't have to wait around at all! Are you married? Yes, how could you tell? My nose- and it tells me you haven't been married for long. I've got a sixth sense about things. I take one look at people and they might as well stand naked before me. If I'd have been a boy, I'd have been a cop. Nobody puts anything over on this girl! I know who I'm dealing with at first glance! That's why I don't mind hiking. Anybody I don't like, I'm out like a shot. [Eugenia] We invited her to have dinner with us and then spend the night at our place. She was very happy about it. Kitty, come here. - Ah, sure! And she was even happier when I suggested she put on some of my things for dinner. Try it on, will you? It's about your size. Oh! Thanks! Okay, I'll try it on. Sure. I'm sure it'll fit. It's awfully sweet of you. Give me a hand. - Okay. There. Careful, there might be some hair caught in the knot. Buttons, buttons. Life's got too many buttons.
