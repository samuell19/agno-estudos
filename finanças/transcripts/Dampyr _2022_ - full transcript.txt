He's under our protection. It is our duty to raise him. Until he's able to make his own choices. The Dampyr lives.

[ominous music swells] [music stops] [ominous music playing] Looks like nobody was spared. Military... civilians. Did they kill each other? Don't talk shit. Someone always survives a fight. Looks like the work of wolves. [scoffs] It was... Easy. ...the devil. It was the devil. What happened here, old man? They opened fire... -my people in the church... -Easy. -...screams, "Blood, blood, blood." -Easy. Who was it? Did you see them? Dampyr. You must call Dampyr. You must call Dampyr. -Dampyr? -You must call-- [gunshot] Shut the fuck up. Damn it, Stefan! [grunts] The fuck is the matter with you? He was just some crazy old fool. [laughing] Call the others. [Stefan continues laughing] Get all the bodies gathered in one place. We need to bury the dead. Move! [scoffs] [dramatic music playing] Let's go. [Lazar] Don't miss anyone! Move them over there. [music fades] [Draka] Harlan. Come here to me. [woman screaming echoing] [groans] -Another one of your nightmares? -[sighs] Yeah. They're getting worse, Yuri. Maybe if you quit drinking that crap. You're too young to be my father. But not too young to be your manager, Harlan. I want you in good shape. We have a lot of work to do. I'm in perfect shape. Can't you see? Stop calling it "work." It is work. Puts food on the table. -Where are you taking me? -Jostanira. Their cemetery is infested. Weren't we there last week? That was Jostalica. -Come on, man. Try to concentrate, please. -[chuckles] Easy. I'm a professional. [kids giggling] [boy] The Dampyr. [Yuri] Come closer. Please. Come closer. The Dampyr is coming. The Dampyr. Whoo! [Yuri] Citizens of Jostanira. I know you're all worried. Evil has reached your peaceful village. And believe me when I tell you, you are right to be afraid. The devil's stench is everywhere, infesting this place. You are damned. You heard me, you are damned and you already know it. But from now on, you will fear no evil. Because today... finally, here in your midst stands the powerful... Harlan... the Dampyr. -[crowd gasps, then murmuring] -[girl] The Dampyr. Take me to the cemetery. Get back. Give him room to work. -[yells] -[Yuri] Get back. The Dampyr feels the presence of a vampire. Get back. [whispering prayers] Out, damned soul. Return to the hell that spawned you. You don't belong in this holy place. [exhales] Errare humanum, carpe diem, carpe, morgana morgantibus, -Margherita pizza... -[man] What is he saying? Esoteric formulas to seal the cemetery and make it impossible for evil to return. God, I could use a fucking drink right now, Yuri. Morgana morgantibus. Millennial knowledge. Ah. [indistinct chatter] Shh. [crowd gasps] [man gasps] Return to your homes in peace. The monster that infected your cemetery has been defeated. [crowd cheering] [festive folk music playing] [Yuri] Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Yuri! [all singing] [static over radio] Commander Kurjak to command. [static over radio] Commander Kurjak to command. Commander Kurjak. Commander Kur-- Fuck it. Now what? We stay here... and maintain our position. [static noise] [ominous music playing] [Petar] I don't get Kurjak. What is the point of staying in this town, huh? This ghost town will help us win the war? [chuckles] Since when did you become a strategist, Petar? Hey. Isn't that what I'm here for? You're here because you have smokes. Give me one. Maybe it will stop me freezing my nuts off. [woman in distance] Help! [Janko] I gotta be dreaming. Oh, you're not dreaming. [woman] Help! -Help me, I'm scared. -[Petar] Sure, baby. I'll help you. Come to Daddy. Wait, Petar. You don't know who the fuck she might be. All right. It looks like she's dying to know me. Petar. [ominous music playing] Help. Petar. Petar. Petar! [Petar screams] [gunfire] [Kurjak] Move! -[gunfire] [Janko] Commander! Who's shooting? Came from down there where those two idiots, Petar and Janko, are. -[gunfire] -[Janko screams] -We're under attack! -Move. Three with me! Move! [hissing] [shuddered breathing] [growling] [growling] [Tito] Who's there? -[growling] -[Tito screams] [Jusfredic] Tito! Tito! [snarls] [snarls] [screaming] [soldiers screaming] -[screaming in distance] -[gunfire] -Move. -Commander. We are under attack! Commander! Who attacked us? [whooshing] [laughing] [laughing] Hey! Hold your positions! Hold! [soldier 1] What's going on? What's going on? [dramatic music playing] Son of a bitch. [soldier 2] Commander! Commander, we need help! Come on! Cover! Get him down. Move. Who did you see, Josif? [whispering weakly] I shot him, but he didn't die. He didn't die. [gasps] Josif. Josif! Don't do that. We have to call him. [Stefan] Come on, asshole. -The old man was right! -Lazar. Our enemies... hellish creatures! Undead! -What is wrong with you? -Our bullets are useless against them. We have to find the one who know how to beat them. Who the fuck are you talking about? Huh? I know him. Let me go look for the one... who can help us. [murmuring] [Harlan] I hate it when I have to do the whole show. [Yuri] We're doing nothing wrong. -You call this "doing nothing wrong"? -The girl is already dead. She won't feel a thing. And her parents can go to sleep tonight, knowing she won't wake up as a vampire. That, in my opinion, is what is called "doing good." And it's all thanks to the great Dampyr. Just give me the goddamn stake. [man 1] Save us. -[man 2] You're our savior. -Dampyr. Dampyr. -[Yuri] Get back. -Do you have to cut off her head? She's my youngest daughter, Emina. Save her soul, Dampyr. Hey, let the Dampyr work, okay? -Please! -[inhales deeply] Forgive me, Emina. [crow cawing] -[stake pierces flesh] -[crowd gasps] Oh, my God. -Thanks. Thanks, but-- -[crowd murmuring] Thanks, but please keep quiet. Shh, shh. We are purifying the cemetery of its evil spirits, of which there are so many at this time of death. Thank you, thanks. Show is over, kid. You have to come with us. [Lazar] We're arresting this fraud on orders from our commander. He won't be able to fleece you suckers anymore. Stay back! Stay back! Stay back! If you arrest him, then you have to arrest me too. Beat it, kid! -Down, boy. -Not going anywhere without my manager! I didn't recognize you. Otherwise, I would have hit you harder. You haven't changed a bit since the day we met. The advantages of living a healthy life. You, on the other hand, look like shit. The war does not agree with you. You can't arrest us for giving people hope. "Hope." Too bad for those stupid fucks. And we're not arresting you. Our commander wants to talk to you. Talk to us? -What? Two useless, meaningless bums? -Yeah, you're right, kid. The truth is, it's Harlan he wants to talk to. What the fuck am I gonna tell him? What's really going on here, Lazar? [ominous music playing] Move. Let's go. Open up! [Yuri] Hey, I'm his manager. Butt out, kid. Here he is, commander. [thunder rumbling] Well? "Well," what? You're the ones that brought me here. I was better off not seeing your ugly faces. Show Commander Kurjak some respect. [sarcastically] Yes, sir, colonel. Private Harlan reporting for duty. No? If we've finished with the introductions, can someone tell me what I'm doing here? I got nothing to do with this war. Sit. Please. This war involves us all. You too, Dampyr. Something attacked us last night. Killed my men. Something not of this world. I want to know what. And they tell me that you know. Hmm. What exactly are you? Me? I'm a Dampyr. A vampire hunter. Me and my partner, we go around making sure anyone bitten by those hellish creatures doesn't come back to life. Then you know how to kill them. Yeah. But you really wanna know what I am? I'm full of shit. Vampires don't exist, you fucking fool. [laughing] [chuckles] [Harlan continues laughing] [grunts] [Harlan groans] Get him up. I'm his manager. I have to be with him. He has the right to have someone defend him. -[Harlan grunts] -Hey. Harlan! Harlan. You wanna tell me what you did to my partner? Here he is, all in one piece. For now. [Kurjak] Take a good fucking look. I don't know who or what did this, but the same could happen to you tonight. Are you fucking crazy? The Dampyr is bullshit! [Yuri] Hey, leave him. He's only saying that just to save his own skin. But we come from the same town and we all know what he really is. The son of the devil. The proof is in the fact that he hasn't aged a bit since I first met him. [Kurjak] Let's see which of you is telling the truth. Lazar, give him your gun. Move! It's fully loaded. Don't waste it. Load up! -You're gonna get him killed. -[Stefan] Hey, we gave him a gun. Your friend is the goat to attract the wolf. If he's what they say, he's the wolf, not the goat. [rifle racks] Let's see how this plays out. [imitates gunshot] What a shitty night. -[jingling] -[wind whistling] [woman] Help. Hey. -Hey, it's okay. -Please don't hurt me. What you doing in here? I'm just trying to stay alive. It's okay. Please. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. [dramatic sting plays] [growls] The smell of your blood. -What are you? -What--? What am I? What the fuck are you? [ominous music playing] [vampires snarl] [all laughing] On your feet, handsome. Time for dinner. [roars] Harlan? -We need to see what's happened to him. -No one leaves. [vampires laughing] [trigger clicks] What have you got against my T-shirt? -Now I'm gonna ruin yours. -No, Bojan, no! [roars] [groaning] [screaming] He isn't human. [Milos] How the fuck did you do that? Move! Fire! [roars] [gasping] [growls] [Bojan] Kill him. Kill him! Kill him! [roaring] [Milos screaming] [voice echoing] The Dampyr. Dampyr. [panting] [Milos continues screaming] [flesh sizzling] [panting] [gasping] [groans] Come back here, my children, you cannot defeat him. Not you. You stay. Stay with him and be my eyes. [wind whistling] He's still alive! [Yuri] I thought I was gonna lose you. Oh, my God, are you okay? Yeah. Kurjak, let's get the hell out of this damn place. [soldier 1] If we stay here, we all die. [soldier 2] Yeah, they'll kill us all. [spits] What the fuck did you do to him? -Hm? -It was the sun. There's a girl inside you should see. Fuck. Get inside. You scared? Are you fucking scared? Lazar! -Move! Inside! -Move! Move! We have a prisoner. [woman breathing heavily, then roars] Step back! No one leaves. [rifle racks] Nothing personal, Kurjak, but they didn't say anything about fighting vampires when I signed up. You want to face a court-martial, Stefan? You brought us to this shithole of a village to feed us to these monsters. A bunch of our buddies are dead already! Maybe you're the one who should face a court-martial. And you... if you really are a vampire killer, then waste that thing. Let's drag its ass out into the sun and burn it like the other one! [panting] Let's kill that mons-- -What the hell are you doing, asshole? -Makes no sense killing her. He's right. That's the only thing that can tell us what the fuck we are up against. Let's leave Kurjak here with that thing. -Right. They can kill each other. -Fuck, yeah. Let's get the hell out of here! [soldier] Let's go! It's crazy to stay here, Emil. Come with us. -Let's cross the-- -I'm no deserter. These things could kill us all... and you want to walk away? Pretend they don't exist? Hey. What the hell are we doing here with this crazy soldier and that monster over there? Yuri, look, you, uh... You can't stay here, okay? What? There are some strange things happening to me and I need to, uh... I need to stay here and figure them out. -No, I... -They'll be back. It's... It's dangerous. It's not safe. I'm not leaving you here. -You gotta go. -No. No. Harlan. Take the boy with you. Me and Harlan are a team. Tell them, Harlan. Harlan? Hey, you said we'd always stick together, you promised. Let's go, kid. -You promised me, Harlan. -Let's go. I thought we were family, Harlan. Please, Harlan. Please. Don't do this to me, Harlan. Let me stay with you, Harlan, please. Come away with us. Please, Harlan. Harlan, please. -Let go of me! -Look at it this way, Kurjak. Staying here could be the best way to get yourself killed... and see your son again. Run as far as you can, Stefan. Because as soon as command finds out you're fucking chicken, they will come for you. Then we'll make sure you can't tell anyone... commander. Door! Lock them with the monster. [door slams shut] [hammers pounding] Let's go. [poignant music playing] [Kurjak] Fuck! -How's that working out? -Shut up. Why? You've got no fucking plan. How about we start getting some answers from that bitch? Move. No. Move. It's Tesla. Not "bitch." [rifle racks] You defended me before, soldier. And you... Dampyr, you could have killed me, but I'm still alive. I owe you. [Kurjak] Remember whose side you're on. You saw the hate in her eyes, right? I don't hate you. I hate Gorka. Who's Gorka? My master, Lord of the Night. It's because of him I am what I am. Lord of the what? For a Dampyr, you don't know much, do you? Unlike us ordinary vampires, Lords of the Night don't fear the sunlight. Only Lords of the Night have power to give life to other vampires... and to generate those like you. What do you mean, like me? -Keep your distance from the beast. -Shut up! I need to know. If a Lord of the Night mates with a non-vampire woman, she will give birth to a Dampyr. -I'm not-- I'm not a-- -Your blood tells a different story. I never knew my father. He obviously hid the truth from you to protect you. The Lords of the Night kill those like you at birth. You're way too dangerous. And now, from the moment you killed one of his slaves, Gorka knows you exist. Which means what? He'll do anything to exterminate you. [tense music playing] [coughing] Javor. Shit. [retching] [soldier 1] What's going on? -[soldier 2] Javor? -[Stefan] What the fuck is happening? Why did you stop? Javor. Javor! Javor! Javor! Javor! [soldiers screaming] Run, kid! Run! [yelling] [dramatic music playing] [Lazar] Run, Yuri! Run! [soldiers clamoring and screaming] [screams echoing] -Run, Yuri! -[Harlan groans] What's happening? [gasps, then breathing heavily] -The fuck are you doing to him? -It's him. Gorka. [groaning] [Lazar] Run! [soldier screams] [Lazar] Run! [Lazar] Run, Yuri! Run! [Yuri] Harlan! [exhaling sharply] He's got Yuri. He's got your men. It's my fault. Can you take me to him? Please. [Gorka] Yes, bring him here to my slaughterhouse. Our pack was going back to the city. I can help you find him. Why the fuck would you do that? Huh? Only a Dampyr can kill the Lord of the Night. If Gorka dies... I'm free. I don't trust her. She's one of them. She'll jump us the first chance she gets. No. She's scared of me. I'll watch her, okay? First thing we have to do is find a way out of this fucking church. Well, that's easy, soldier boy.

Monster! Monster! [boy] You're damned. And so is your mother, that filthy witch. -My mother isn't a witch! -Get out of here! [Tesla] The smell of your blood. What are you? -[young Harlan] Mom! [Kurjak] What are you? [boy] Monster! Monster! -[Harlan] What do you mean, like me? -Mom! [Kurjak] What exactly are you? [Lazar] The son of the devil. [screaming] [Draka] Harlan. Come here to me. [woman] Be careful, Harlan. What? What happened? [Kurjak] You tell me. You blacked out in the car. Started babbling like crazy. Shaking like you were possessed or something. I've always had nightmares. Now they seem more and more real. Like memories trying to re-emerge. I-- I don't know. You must think I'm fucking crazy. What we've been through would drive anyone crazy. Fuck! [poignant music playing] Hey, she said she was going for something to eat. And we know what her diet consists of. Her friends could show up at any moment. [Tesla] I don't have any friends. But I can hear you whisper from far away. Didn't your mother teach you it's rude... to whisper about people behind their backs? Huh? Soldier boy? Besides, I've seen the way you fight your war. Do you think you're better than those like me? You know nothing of war. Would you two just fucking quit? [gentle pensive music playing] [Tesla] Your wounds are disappearing. You're just like us. You can't expect Kurjak to accept it as normal. It's hard for me too. Blood has memories. Believe me, I'd rather forget everything than live with the memory of what Gorka forced me to endure. And what he forced me to do. Tesla... I'm trusting you. [whispers] Don't worry. [grunts] What the...? [grunts] [shouts] [roars] Shhh. [Gorka] It gives me such pleasure to feel the fear pulsating in your veins. I shall never tire of playing with your miserable lives, whilst you pray in vain to be spared. [groaning] How does it feel to know your life is coming to an end? I have no idea what death feels like. I can sniff a hint of it from your terror. We have always existed, and we always will, being close to kings and emperors, led them and killed them. Whatever was necessary to placate our thirst. Past, present and future are meaningless to us. Only blood is important. [roars] I will unleash you from your fear. And you, faithful dog... will join my army. [muffled screaming] [gunfire in distance] Everyone's trying to get out of this hellhole... and we're thinking of going in. I know how to get us around the roadblocks. But once we're in... once it gets dark... if there really are more like the beast... then this won't do any good. [gunfire in distance] You never know. Now that the bloodsucker is more comfortable, you want to tell me what you have in mind? [Harlan wincing] You think it'll work? You're the vampire, Tesla. What do you think? It could. Could? Let's fucking see. [Harlan] Well... guess we load them up. Not just a pretty face, huh? [Harlan chuckles] Here. You want one? Yeah. The beast wants one. You're dangerous enough without one. You're right, soldier boy. But if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. But if I enter the city barehanded, I'm dead meat. Suits me. I won't have to watch my back for you anymore. You know, you're really starting to piss me off. [grunts] Tesla! Just... let him go. [grunting] How about we see if these new bullets work, huh, Harlan? Go ahead. Shoot. It'd only be a liberation for me. [chuckles] Your war is child's play compared to what I've been through. So do me a favor, soldier boy, cut your macho-man bullshit. [grunts] [Harlan] Hey. [groans] [gentle pensive music playing] Tesla... you know I could have shot you, right? I know. But you didn't. Because you know what it means to be different. Be careful. It's my blood. [Kurjak] Let's move, lovebirds. [music turns tense] [rapid gunfire in distance] [indistinct chatter] [helicopter whirring overhead] [folk music playing] [Kurjak] I've done my bit. Now it's the bloodsucker's turn. Gorka's lair is under the old library. We need to walk through this-- [missile whistles] Move! [people screaming] Come on. [girl] Dad! Dad, wait! [woman] Naya, come on! Hurry up, hurry up! They're coming. -[girl] Let's go, let's go! -[man 1] Let's go, they're coming! [man 2] Let's go, let's go! -What is it? -It's better to avoid the busier streets. Come on. Follow me. Something's wrong. Tesla! -[thunder rumbling] -[gunfire in distance] [Kurjak] We've been walking for hours. [rifle racks] I think the bitch walked us into a fucking trap. [Tesla] I can't get you to him. Gorka set it up. -He knows we're coming. -You warned him. I didn't have to. Lords of the Night know everything, you can't hide from them. You fucking warned him! They're here. [vampires roaring] [ominous music playing] Son of a bitch. -[guffaws] -[rapid gunfire] Fuck! Move! [tense music playing] [gunfire continues] Stop, you bastards! [laughs sinisterly] [rifle racks] It fucking works! I told you it would. [growls] [shouts] [grunts] [laughing] [grunting] [yelling] [Lazar] Our new master... wants you dead, you son of a witch. [Lazar gasping] Told you war was bad for you, you little shit. [Dejan growling] [muffled screaming] [muffled screaming continues] Fuck you! Need some help there, old man? -Fuck you. -[chuckles] Come on. -[groans] -[grunts] There we go. [Kurjak] The only one I wanted to kill was Stefan. I know. [soft thud] Wait! Fuck this. It's okay. Harlan. It's Gorka. He's making me do this. You can fight him, Tesla. You're wrong. He's too strong. Move out of the fucking way. [sobbing] You are not his slave. I can't help it. Move. Kill me. Please kill me. Please kill me. [gunshot] Fuck it! I'm sorry. [Kurjak] Harlan! Hey. Come. -Come. -[groans] Fuck. [Harlan groans] -Okay. Clean the wound. -[breathing heavily] -It is going to sting. -Okay. -Ready? -Yeah. [Harlan grunts] [Harlan groans] [wincing] [Kurjak] There we go. Okay, okay. -Drink. -Yeah. That's it. You're gonna be okay. -[Kurjak] Brave boy. -[Harlan] Yeah. [Harlan exhales] That photo in your pocket... it was your wife and son, right? Miklos and Miljiana. Miklos was 9 when he was killed. I'm sorry. This is war. Keep the pressure on. [Harlan groans] From the moment you're born... they tell you that their way is the right way. They teach you to the point that not only do you believe it yourself... but in the end... it becomes you who teaches it to others. To command it, even. Maybe there is no right team. Maybe we're all destined to be on the wrong side. Or maybe this is the only war that deserves to be fought. [dramatic music playing] [gunfire in distance] [girl screaming] [gasps, then screams] [panting] [gasps] -[gasps, then screaming] -[roaring] Please, don't! [roars] [screams, then breathing heavily] [screams] [growls] You can't rebel. We belong to the same master. [growls] [roaring] [panting] I belong to no one. It's okay. [eerie whispering] [Gorka] Love is so overestimated. I prefer fear. [ominous music playing] And you are scared now, Tesla. Because you know, like a dog, you have bitten the hand that feeds you. [growls] A vampire and a Dampyr. Don't you see the irony of that? You are insignificant! [coughs] [groans] A puppet who only moves when I pull the strings. My property. And mine alone. The Dampyr will find you... and he will kill you. I want him to find me. And then I will remedy the mistake they made in allowing him to live. [gasping] [laughing sinisterly] [Harlan] You're not much of a nurse. Is this how you watch over the dying? You got a death wish? No? Nice to see that when you were patching me up, you took more of my blood. Ah. [sighs] Let me see the wound. Shit. -And it doesn't hurt. -Never seen anything like it. [laughing] I partnered up with a fucking superhero, huh? Yeah. Or maybe a monster. [ominous music playing] [Harlan] This looks like the place. What now, pretty boy? Go in, kill Gorka, free Yuri. Simple. Simple. [Harlan] It's quiet. [Kurjak] Too quiet. Let's meet upstairs. [boy giggles] [boy laughs] [boy laughing] [boy] Daddy? Miklos? [Miklos] Daddy? [yelling] Fucking hell! [Miklos] Daddy... why did you leave me? Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me? [screaming] Kurjak? [suspenseful music playing] -[woman screams] -[baby crying] [man laughs] [Kurjak groans] [groans] Tesla? Tesla. [Stefan laughs sinisterly] [continues laughing] Have a good nap... commander? [chuckling] [moans] Mmm. [chuckling] Leave her. Leave her! Fucking leave her! -[screaming] -[laughing] -Stop! [yells] -[Tesla continues screaming] [Tesla continues screaming] [yells] -[screaming] -[laughing] [grunting] [groaning] [spits] You fucking piece of shit. [screams] Stop! [chuckling] I've always despised you, Kurjak. You and your obsession with rules. [cackles] Your fucking sense of honor. [groaning] They might have turned you into a monster, Stefan... but one thing will never change. You're still a fucking pussy. [growls] [chocking] [yelling] [screaming] [groaning] [continues screaming] [groans] [groaning] [grunts] [grunts] [groans] [moaning] [breathing heavily] [Kurjak sighs] [groaning] [Tesla breathing heavily] [Harlan] Gorka! Yuri! [eerie music playing] I've been expecting you, Dampyr. [ominous music playing] You're too slow. [laughs] And now, in my kingdom, I can finally kill you. [shouting] [grunts] You can try it, you fucking monster. Monster? Me? [grunts] You're the only abomination here. [grunts] [groaning] Now that I have you in front of me, your stink confirms what I have always suspected. You belong to Draka's lineage. Draka was a fool. He should never have let you into this world or live so long. And if he wanted to use you solely for revenge... then he miscalculated. Just as I drove him from here centuries ago... now I will kill you. Blood of his blood... how dare you live so long? [groaning] Impressive. Don't you think it's sublime... the futility of all this? [grunts] -[groans] -No, don't faint yet. I have someone who wants to say goodbye to you. [grunting] A special friend. [eerie music playing] Harlan? Yu-- Yuri. Yuri, forgive me. For what? I knew you'd come for me. Unfortunately, it's too late. Yuri. No! [claws piercing flesh] I'm sorry, old friend. Gorka is my master now. [gasps] I couldn't stop him. He was in my head. I know. [poignant music playing] I don't wanna live like this. Please, Harlan. [whimpers] It's okay, Yuri. I'm here. You're a true Dampyr, my friend. It was great... working with you. [inaudible] What a heartbreaking farewell. [grunting] [yelling] [chuckling] Oh. The soldier and the traitor. You fucking bastard. You will remain buried here... drenched in the suffering these walls have seen. And you will live that suffering for eternity... with every fiber of your being. [foreboding music playing] [heart beating slowly] [heartbeat fades] [thunder cracking] [woman] It's time to choose, Harlan. I must know. [ominous music playing] [Draka] Harlan. Come. Come here to me. What is wrong, Harlan? Are you afraid of your own father? Or should I perhaps be afraid of my son? Listen to your blood, my son. Listen to who you are. [determined music playing] [screaming] [growling] Why did Draka let you live, Dampyr? Why? [Harlan grunts] [growling] I have lived like a god amongst creatures that are destined to die. But because of you, Dampyr... now I know... the brilliant glare... of death. [groans] You fought well, soldier. [stone door opening] [suspenseful music playing] Come on. [Kurjak] What is this place? [Tesla] This can't have anything to do with Gorka. Gorka said it once belonged to my father. This is my father. That's how I see him in my visions. I guess ugly runs in the family, then. There are many others like him. Then it's going to be a long war. Welcome to the world of nightmares, soldier boy. We're gonna become their nightmare. [determined music playing] [Draka] Our son has made his choice, Velma. He has become... the Dampyr. [woman 1] But he didn't agree to follow you. Nor to become your ally. He might try to kill you. Perhaps. Or... perhaps he will heed the call of his blood. My blood. [ominous music playing] For this is only the beginning. The beginning of my war.
