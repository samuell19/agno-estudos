So, whether it's about fear of contaminants, convenience, or just that crisp taste... Bottled water has become an $18-billion-a-year business... And that... is news we can use. Nick and Linda? Speaking of taste, Ruby... Is bottled really better than tap? It depends on where you live, but let's see if you can tell the difference between our tap water here at the TV station and the leading bottled water. Are you up for an H2O taste test? You know I love a challenge. Bring it on! Cold. Crisp. I'm betting this one is bottled. This one is from the bottle. Let's take a look. Bottled? It was tap! We were wrong! No kidding. Keep your water cold and filtered in one of these pitchers, and reusable bottles not only save you a bundle, t they'll also help save the environment. So what is "on tap" for tomorrow, Ruby? We're going to take a look into the growing world of vitamin supplements. Which ones can you trust? We'll have an exclusive interview with the founder of Natalie's All Naturals. Well, I hope she can make one of her signature smoothies. Me too! Thanks for that refreshing report, Ruby. And coming up, with the influx of bears in the Seattle suburbs, cameras have been placed in and around the Emerald City. Ruby? You have a visitor. Natalie! What a nice surprise. I heard Linda and Nick wanted smoothies in your report, so I came bearing gifts. You are so thoughtful. It's the least I can do, since you're profiling my company tomorrow. Well, I'm happy to do it. Let me tell you, following your fitness plan, I haven't felt this good since high school. I'm even running now. That's wonderful. It's a miracle. Okay, where's the chocolate? Frank. Meet Natalie Billings. I'm sorry. Nice to meet you, Natalie. You too. You should try her yoga class sometime. It might help loosen you up. Loosen me up? Ha, well, I'm a news director, not a cruise director. Well, you're welcome at the studio anytime. I appreciate that. I think it's amazing that you're still teaching yoga, after all your success. It's just what I love to do. And it keeps me connected to my clients. And on that note, I've got to run. I've got a marketing meeting in 30 minutes, and then a class. I'm telling you, this woman can do it all. Thank you, Ruby. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. First thing in the morning. I'll walk you out. Nice to meet you. Wow. She's a lot more down-to-earth than I thought. Off to the arson scene, boss. Loved the H2O-in-the-know segment, Ruby. Powerful stuff. Thanks, Todd. Catch ya later. I know... Just give him a chance, okay? I actually think the two of you could make a great team on the crime beat. Does that include a raise and some disinfectant? Ruby. Right. You know that I like fighting for the underdog and sticking it to the scam artists. I just, I'm not sure I'm ready to give that up. And no one is better at consumer investigations, but sometimes it's nice to flex a new muscle. Loosen up a little. I'll think about it. Yeah, I take Natalie's yoga class with Jenny, and we volunteer for her charity, Oceans Aware. That's cool. I used to spend weekends as a kid cleaning up plastic along the shorelines. Have you ever heard of the Pacific garbage patch? No. Well, Natalie's charity's helping to clean it up. There are over 5 trillion pieces of garbage floating in the Pacific Northwest alone. That's no joke. Good for her. Ruby! I love this outfit. I always see you in sweats. -Thanks. "Reporter Ruby" today. Tripp and I are here to shoot the segment with Natalie. Of course, she said you were coming. Although, I haven't seen her this morning. Let me get Amanda. Yeah, Ruby's here for Natalie. Amanda is Natalie's Chief Operating Officer. Okay, thanks. Amanda's on her way. Ruby. I'm so glad to see you. Thank you for having us. This is Tripp, my cameraman. - Hi. - Pleasure. Listen, I don't think we're going to be able to shoot the segment today. Is everything okay? Would you mind if Ruby and I spoke in private? I can set up over there. Great. This way. So no one's heard from her since yesterday? No. When's the last time you saw her? Here at the office, around 4:00. She said she wasn't feeling well after teaching a class, and went home early. She seemed fine when she came by the station, around 2:00. Did she say what was wrong? No, but we had an important conference call at 5:00, which she missed, and then she didn't respond to any of my calls or texts after that. So I called her housekeeper this morning, and she said that her bed hadn't been slept in. That's not good. I know, right? This isn't like her. She never would've blown off this shoot with you, either. Have you called the police? I did, and they let me file a report over the phone, but they said there wasn't much they could do because she hasn't been missing for very long. Do you have the password to her computer? Maybe she has a find-your-phone app connected to it. Her assistant should have that. Well, her phone is still on. It's pinging on Mountain Crest Road. That's on the way to her house. Looks like it's right near mile marker 15. - I should call the police. - Yeah. I'm sorry, but you can't come any closer. We were the ones who called. Ruby? Jake? What are you doing here? I located Natalie's car. Is she okay? No. Sorry, Ruby. She didn't make it. What? Are you friends with her? Yeah. Yeah. I was supposed to shoot a segment with her for the news today. She didn't show up, so I tracked her through her phone. What happened? Her car went just over that embankment. I'm sorry. Why? The weather's been perfect. We're not sure. Maybe it was an animal that crossed the road or something. Could she have been texting? No. Her phone was found zipped in her purse. How did she just lose control? I know. That's why they called me. I'm helping the team get to the bottom of things. Detective! Over here. Okay, one minute. Look, I gotta go. I'm sorry. Hey, Tripp, do you see that? Yes. You think maybe it's one of those bear cameras we had on the news yesterday? Could've captured the accident. Exactly. Well, the car rolled over the embankment, which is tragic. - What? - Yeah. No. Ruby, how goes the shoot? Didn't happen. Natalie Billings... is dead. I'm sorry, what? Yeah, I know, I'm... I know, I'm shocked, too. Hey, listen, can I... can I ask you to do me a quick favor? I'm just trying to figure out what happened here. Of course. I need you to look up the wildlife bear cameras for me. Okay. Looks like it's camera 12, off of Mountain Crest Road. Let me work my magic. I'll get you a link. Great, thanks. Look at that swerving SUV. It's obviously Natalie's. Yeah. Did you see that? That SUV just turned back around. Whoever was driving had to see the accident. Someone's in a hurry. Who doesn't stop for something like that? No kidding. Did you catch a license plate? Couldn't make it out. Did Tripp at least get any footage of the scene? Some, but we didn't shoot the car. It felt insensitive in front of Amanda. Right. You didn't shoot the wrecked car? Journalism 101. Some of us have scruples. I hear there's a surveillance video. An exclusive like that could really move the ratings needle. I'm not sure if I want to air it. Not yet, anyway. Seriously? I was just about to ask Ruby if she thought there was anything more to the accident. A clear day, she wasn't on her phone... and that mystery SUV, it's what bothers me the most. Sounds like a story for the crime beat. My crime beat. I don't think we have enough yet. Journalism 101. Don't rush to air. I think there's gotta be more to this. I'm gonna pay Tommy a visit. 'Kay, that's a good plan. Ruby? I'm sorry about Natalie. Thanks, Frank. So good to see you. Your folks invited me over to dinner next week. They always ask about you. I finally told them, "Ask your godson yourself." So, what brings you by? Natalie Billings. Are you covering the accident? Sort of. Do you know how she died? I really shouldn't be talking about the case with you. -You know I'm a vault. And look how our last case turned out. Who could forget? Did you get the footage I sent you? Yes, thank you. We actually had our own. Look, I'm reserving judgment on how the accident happened until I can meet with the police mechanic in the morning, and until Tommy weighs in. So what do you got? So... Tommy and I need to talk. All right. Fine. What do ya got, Tommy? I'm not done my autopsy yet, but an initial blood test revealed no alcohol, drugs or prescription medications in her system. All right, what about injuries from the crash? They're typical of this type of accident. So she died from the accident? Not necessarily. I have more tests to run. There could be internal bleeding, but I'd say unlikely, with the air bag going off, and she was wearing her seatbelt. All right, what about heart attack or stroke, or something like that? Possible, but I'd say unlikely, given her age. And the amazing shape she was in. For sure. So that's all I've got for now. More answers soon. Thanks. Call me when you got something. And Ruby, thanks for your interest. I will send out a press release if there's anything newsworthy. Okay. See you at the police garage tomorrow? Good luck getting past the gate. Don't you say a word. Who am I gonna tell? The usual for my favorite father-daughter duo. - Thanks, Kiki. - Thanks. I've been bringing you to this place for 25 years now. Vanilla's still the one? What can I say? I'm predictable. The one thing I know for sure... My daughter is anything but predictable. What's your gut telling you? That a car doesn't just go off the road on a clear day without a good explanation. With a wealthy woman like Natalie, money could be a motive, if someone wanted her dead. Well, you always taught me, it's about love or money, right? Yeah. And I found out how much she's worth... 25 million. Well, okay then. Someone just landed a windfall. Any idea who's in the will? Not yet. I know she has a boyfriend. He's a doctor. And, apparently, her sister Kate's her only living relative. What do you know about her? Not much. I see her in yoga sometimes. She's not that friendly. And when has that ever stopped you before? That was a hard class. I should have na-ma-stayed in bed. Smoothies on me today. Hey, guys. The usual? Yes, please. It's hard to believe that Natalie's gone. Yeah, so sad. This place will never be the same. I'm surprised the studio's even open today. So many people wanted to come by and offer their condolences. Amanda decided to keep classes going, almost like a grieving outlet. That was nice. Yeah. So how's the painting going? It's going. The art world's a finicky place. He's being modest. His profile is rising. Actually, Roger has a gallery showing this Saturday. I'm excited. Actually, I would love it if you would come, too. Yeah. Yeah. Jenny and I would love to come. Sure. Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go hit the showers. I have a meeting with a potential realtor, so I'll see you guys later. Let me throw you a housewarming party. This one's beautiful. Thanks. Ruby. - Hi. - Hey. How are you holding up? Not good. I just, I keep going across the hallway to her office. You two were so close. I can't imagine what you're going through. It hasn't even really sunk in yet. I've just been scrambling to try and take care of the business and the charities. Who's taking over Oceans Aware? Me, I guess, until I can find someone else. But I haven't decided whether or not to move forward with the fundraiser. The tickets have been sold out for months, but... Well, it's such a big money-maker for the charity. But doesn't it feel too soon? Well, I'm sure she would want it to go on. And the cause was so important to her. You're probably right. Yeah. When is the funeral? Monday. I hope you can make it. Of course, I'll be there. Thank you. That means a lot. Well, I guess I better get back to it. And remember, I'm always a yoga class away if you need me. You're so sweet, Ruby. Thank you. Roger. All right, well, I'm gonna head out, too. Work calls. Good luck. Excuse me. Hi. Impound lot and police garage. Can I help you? Hi, Ruby Herring. 57 News. Can I come in? I just have a really quick question. Did you get your car towed? No. Was your car in an accident? No. Was your car stolen? No. Then no. Hmph. Hi. I'd like to report a car illegally parked across the street from the police department. The car was solid. Nothing wrong with the brakes, the steering, the suspension. Perfect condition. So you think it was human error? Best bet, yes. With the good conditions, brand-new $80,000, turbo V6, top-of-the-line safety features... Hold on. Ruby? Hi. Jake. Hi. You lost? No shady mechanics around here. Craziest thing... my car got towed. You didn't? Didn't what? Have your car towed to sneak in here? Who would do something crazy like that? You. Gonna introduce you to my buddy, Jeff, at the gate. Your little stunt's gonna cost you 250 bucks. Ouch. He does owe me a favor. Great. But check your phone. We should see Tommy first. He said it's urgent. Yeah? I'm ready to rule on an official cause of death. Off the record. Promise. Okay. Fine. But if I see one news report about this, it'll be more than your car that's locked up at the police station, okay? You impounded her car? Well, no, technically, she impounded her car. Nancy Drew strikes again. You two confuse and intrigue me at the same time. Natalie Billings didn't die of crash-related injuries, or a heart attack or stroke. Her organs shut down. I found kidney and liver damage. Respiratory failure. Get this. I found a drug in her system called "colchicine." What's colchicine? It's an anti-inflammatory that treats a type of joint pain associated with arthritis. People who are overweight or have high-fat diets can be susceptible. That's definitely not Natalie. So how'd it kill her? Well, it's prescribed to patients in extremely low doses. Too high a dose, it's lethal. It's made from a very toxic plant called autumn crocus. So she was poisoned? Murdered, and whoever did it knew what they were doing. Colchicine doesn't show up on standard tox screens. You have to know what you're looking for. I had a hunch with her multiple organ failures. I'm gonna have to get some warrants. I don't think you're gonna need a warrant for the yoga studio. Amanda, it's Ruby. We need your help. There's Natalie in the lobby, leaving for the day. Was she carrying one of those reusable cups from the smoothie bar? It wasn't in her car. But I noticed a stain on her console. Here. And if she took her smoothie with her, I wonder what happened to it. Good question. Well, I gotta get my CSI team in here. Tonight. Good. Okay... I can't believe her death is suspicious. Tell me more about the guy who makes the smoothies? Roger? Yeah. He's one of Natalie's success stories. When he came here, he was grossly overweight, he had a host of health issues. That was before my time. What was wrong with him? I can't say for certain. Sorry. Excuse me. That's me. Sure. Amanda Kelly. Roger's a local artist. He's actually having a show tomorrow night. I told him I'd come. You should drop by. Maybe you could find something for your bachelor pad. No thanks. But call me if you need rescuing. I'll be sure to leave a glass slipper by the door. Sorry about that. No problem. Can you tell me more about Natalie's boyfriend? Podiatrist, right? Yes, Steve McClurren. They've been together for about a year. Everything seemed to be going okay. Were they still together when she died? Yep. Actually, they were supposed to go to a medical conference in Vancouver, but she canceled the day before. Do you know why? She didn't say. He might still be up there, though. We're done here, boss. Okay. Great. Um, I probably have more questions, but I'll wrap up the team and get out of your hair. -Okay. Can I ask you something? Sure. Did you think that Steve and Natalie were on the outs? I don't know, she didn't really talk to me about him, which is odd, because, you know, we were pretty close. That being said, she didn't have the best taste in men. You didn't like him? Steve is obnoxious. What about violent? No. No, no. That's not what I meant. I noticed that you had a certain tone with Roger. Do you have an issue with him? No. Natalie did. I sure didn't like the way he spoke to her. Well, what happened? She commissioned a painting from him for the fundraiser, to be auctioned off. When he delivered it, it looked nothing like what they had agreed upon, and she refused to pay him. Wow. He must've been upset. More like nasty. I told her to let him go, but she felt bad because he was a struggling artist. Would it be okay if I take Natalie's computer? Yeah, of course. I'll get it for you. Okay. Great. Ask about Roger's painting. Okay. Natalie's sister, Kate, was at Natalie's classes all week. She hadn't been in months, and, suddenly, she's back the week her sister dies. Were they close? I don't know, I never paid much attention. See if she's on social media. Last name? Billings. Kate Billings. Yep. That's her. Is that weird? There's not a picture of or with Natalie. Who's that? He's tagged Rupert Waldrin. CEO of Tide Well Shipping. Isn't that the company that just got fined for polluting the ocean? Yep, $2 million. It looks like Natalie came out in the press against Rupert. That must've caused some tension between the sisters. I wonder if Jake's seen this. Seen what? Off the record, for now. Okay. Looks like Natalie Billings was poisoned. Seriously? Yeah. I'll have us something to report soon, but I really want to be on this case. I need to do it, for Natalie. Yeah. Okay, I trust your judgment. I'll let Todd know that's your story. Can I watch? You tell... Is that a no? Kate Billings? Yes. Hi. It's Detective Killian. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. I'm a little confused as to why I'm here. I just have a few questions for you. I need your help with the investigation. Come. Natalie was murdered? How? Who? I'm not at liberty to say how, but I am doing everything I can to catch the person who did this. You were at her studio the day she died. How did she seem? She was pale. She even ended class early. I offered to drive her home, but she said she was okay. How was your relationship with her? It was fine. There wasn't tension over your relationship with the shipping CEO? I was actually gonna tell her that day that we broke up. I wanted to smooth things over. That was your only issue? Well, I mean, we didn't see eye-to-eye on a lot of things, but we loved each other. What'd you disagree over? It had to do with business. I didn't know you were involved. No, I'm not, but I gave her the money to start up her first yoga studio. I'm sure she paid you back. Of course. But, when Natalie's All Naturals took off, she became obsessed with philanthropic causes, like Oceans Aware. Last year, she gave away millions in profits. I was afraid she was gonna give everything away. You didn't like that. I didn't understand it. I mean, she worked hard for that money. Where are you going with this? I'm sorry, I'm just trying to understand your family dynamic. I really have to get going. Are we done? I'm sorry, again, it's just... standard procedure. Thank you for your time. This isn't the way we go to the next open house. Yeah. I just need to run a quick errand. What kind of errand? Where are we? Roger's place. We're at Roger's? I just want to see what kind of car he drives. Why? Whoever killed Natalie was driving a dark-colored SUV. I've already checked out her sister's place. Okay, well, I don't see any vehicle here, so we should probably go, Ruby. This feels weird, spying on him like this. We're not spying. We're just observing. Besides, he's our friend, right? There he is. Duck! I can't believe it. He drives a gray SUV. Does that mean he's the killer? I don't know, but it's a gray SUV! So I take it we're not going to the art show tonight, given the fact that he could be a homicidal maniac. We're definitely going. My gosh, that is a cop! Ruby. Seriously? Ladies. Or should I say "Cagney and Lacey." Wow. That was a fun trip back to the '80s. Hey, that was my mom's favorite show. So, can I ask what you're doing here? We're... house-hunting. - House-hunting? - Yeah. Didn't realize Roger's studio's for sale. - We were spying on him. - Jenny! I'm sorry, you know how I buckle under pressure. Meet my best friend, Jenny Taylor. Jenny, this is Detective Jake Killian. He's the detective that you... know? So Ruby's told you all about me? Hardly. We're not in trouble. And we have to go. A lot of open houses to see. So any idea where Roger went? He went that way. - "That way"? - Yeah. Wow, you're like a human GPS. I'll nab him in no time with those coordinates. I know that he'll be at the gallery tonight. So maybe we'll see you there. In the meantime... gotta run. Wait. Wait, wait. If you need help, my mother, she's a realtor. There you go. All right. Drive safe. He's cute. Yeah, if you like know-it-all detective types. I know that look since your first crush... Bobby Daniels, third grade. You like Detective Dreamy, don't you? Nice try. What was that address again? Ruby. Jenny. -Derek. The paintings, aren't they beautiful? I love the ocean themes. I'm actually gonna look around some more. Maybe I'll find a piece for that house I haven't bought yet. There you go. Derek, do you know anything about a painting that Natalie commissioned from Roger? Yeah. Right over here. Derek, you're close with Roger. Why didn't he just paint it the way Natalie wanted? He wanted to make a statement about pollution with the piece. Seems like the water bottle theme would be right up her alley. Normally, yes, but Natalie wanted to keep things positive. She wanted this painting to be uplifting. - Not depressing. - Exactly. Did they ever resolve things? Apparently not. They got into a fight at the yoga studio. Roger got really defensive and some customers overheard them fighting. He felt pretty embarrassed. I've never seen that side of him. It only comes out when his art is criticized. You know, he's one of the nicest people, and, also, of course, he's one of the most eligible bachelors in Seattle. Recently back on the market. "Recently"? He was daring an older woman. Natalie? All I know is that it was someone from the studio. Is that...? Detective Killian. Ruby. - Hi. - Hi. Derek, right? Detective. I didn't peg you as an art lover. Well, I did paint my patio a month ago, but, I'm afraid this is police business. Unless I'm getting arrested, this is my cue to mingle. So, you came, yet no damsel in distress here. Well, I was hoping to talk to our artist. He won't return my calls, and he didn't come home today. Well, you're in luck. The artist is coming towards us right now. Hiding in plain sight, apparently. Ruby, I'm so glad you could make it. You... You look stunning. Thank you. Um, who's your date? No, it's... he's not my date. Detective Jake Killian. Seattle P.D. Yes, Detective Killian. I'm sorry I didn't call you back. Yeah, why didn't you? I've been busy with getting ready for the show. Okay, I'd just like to ask you a few questions about Natalie Billings. Natalie? I'm not sure I can be of any help, and it's not exactly the best time, at the moment. How about I come in on Monday? You can ask me anything. -Sure, 9:00 a.m., at the station? Sure. Good. You're staying? Yep. Don't turn into a pumpkin until midnight. Plenty of time to find your Prince Charming. I'm sure. Okay, I, I have a game to catch. You two kids have fun, all right? 9:00 a.m. So, what do you think? You are... No, thank you. So very talented. Everything is so thought-provoking. Thank you. What's the story behind that one? I call it "Beach vs. Blight." I really see it. The water bottles really send a message. Right? Yeah, it's what we don't see that can impact us the most. I mean, the one bottle seems innocuous, but it's indicative of what's underneath. You know, not one square-mile of the surface of the ocean is free from plastic pollution anywhere in the world. Wow. I don't think many people think about it in that way. Yeah, that's why we've got to keep raising the awareness. Exactly. - Thank you. - No, thank you. I'm surprised it hasn't sold yet. Well, I, I did have a buyer. What happened? It was, creative differences. Yeah. Great. - Thanks. - No, thanks. These hors d'oeuvres are delicious. You should try one. -I can't. Allergies? No, no, it's no big deal. I'm on an anti-inflammatory, so, sadly, no seafood. Bravo, Roger. We have to head out. I got a text from the office, and we do have three open houses tomorrow. Well, thank you, ladies, for coming. It was a nice night. The pleasure was all mine. Excuse me. I'm Tom. I'd like to see that painting there. I think it's truly compelling. - It's just great. - Okay. It's the perfect starter house. I'm so proud of you, Jenny. Graduating business school at the top of your class, all the long hours you put in at your job. You've really earned it. -Well, I couldn't have done it without all your pep talks. Hi, ladies. Janice Killian. You must be Jenny. Hi. And Ruby, of course. I love your reports. Well, thank you. I'm so glad Jake put us in touch with you. -Me too. I still can't believe you solved the Sugar Tucker murder together. He said you were a big help. He did, did he? You know, that was his first case back here in Seattle. We're so happy to have him home. Nothing more important than family. Is that why he came back? No. Actually... There was an incident in New York. I-I'm sorry. No! He's doing great now. In fact, why don't I show you the kitchen first? -Great. Something smells good. Cookies are ready, Mom. Yeah. This is a good look for you. Jake makes the best cookies. I really should get going. No. Please, stay. You should stay, Jake. Ms. Killian? Would you show me upstairs? Of course! I... love this side of you. A baker with a badge. Yeah, okay, that's... That's enough. So how was the rest of the show? You buy any Roger Rembrandts? So you do know art? There's a lot you don't know about me, Ruby. -Yeah, apparently so. And, no, I didn't buy anything, but I wanted to talk to you about something Roger did, or didn't do, I should say. Okay, I'm listening. He passed on the shrimp and the scallops, said he was on medication. That's a sure sign of a guilty man. I'm being serious. The drug that poisoned Natalie was colchicine. Remember, Tommy said it was used to treat joint pain? When you're on colchicine, they recommend you stay away from shellfish and alcohol. Speak of the devil. It's Roger? Yep! What does he want? For me to stop by his studio this afternoon. Why? I purposely left something behind in his gallery, hoping he'd call me. I just want to get a peek inside his medicine cabinet. That's not a good idea, Ruby. Could you get a warrant? Unlikely, at this stage of the investigation. Then do you have a better plan? Okay, fine. But I'm your back-up. My very own Hardy Boy. -No, this is serious. I'm gonna wait outside, and I want you to keep your phone on so I can hear everything. Okay? Fine. -All right. Take another. Hi. Okay, whatever you do, don't hang up. Roger. Ruby, hey! I thought I heard somebody out here. Well, here, after you. So this is where the inspiration happens. Yeah, this is it. I quit my day job five years ago at a software company and never looked back. Wow. You must really love painting. Yeah, it's a life-long dream, but it doesn't always pay the bills. Well, hopefully, you sold a lot of art last night. Actually, I sold "Beach vs. Blight." - No way. - Yeah! Well, congratulations. Thanks, yeah. That sale felt good. Great. Um... You have my scarf? - Yes. - Great. But... I want you to do something first. Um... Come here. Here. You want me to paint something? Yeah, why not? Just express what you're feeling. No, I re... I can't. Of course you can. Just let out your inner artiste. Here, come on. I'll help you. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - All right. Step right up. So, where should we start? How about we start with some... So, um... See, now, just right here... We're gonna start with just some happy little bushes. Okay? Why not happy? - There you go. - Okay. Now we're gonna make our first big decision. Okay, let's be bold. Where does the tree go? - Middle? - Okay, here we go. See look at that. We're blending. Wow. There you go. Definitely a minimalist. But it looks beautiful. Thank you. You know what, could I borrow your bathroom just to... wash up? Yeah, yeah, of course, it's just through that door. - Great. Thanks. - Yeah, no problem. You okay in there? Yeah. Be a second. Well, thanks. You still have some paint on your hands. Yeah, yeah, wouldn't come off. I got something stronger. No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it. I really should get going. Get going? You just got here. I still have work that I have to finish up, but, really, thank you for everything. -Wait, you can't go. Well, not without your... not without your scarf. Of course. - Great. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Here. Let me get that for you. Can you arrest him? Maybe on the charges of blending. I'm serious. I don't have enough evidence yet. Here. One of his pills. You know I can't use this as evidence. But in light of this, I'll put a tail on him. Really? Wanna grab a bite? Sure. Yeah. I... I know a great diner, it's an old cop hangout. It's, um, it's a little ways from here, but, honestly, it has the best burgers in town. A break from kale? Twist my arm. All right. What is it? My dad and I have been coming to this diner since I was a kid. What? So you do know their burgers. Actually, the vanilla ice cream. Better than your green kale? Yeah. Can I get you kids anything else? No, I am stuffed. That was delicious, Kiki. No vanilla ice cream, sweetie? Not tonight. You really do know this place. Yeah, Kiki's practically family. So, do you think Roger did it? Just when I was enjoying myself. I know he looks guilty, but I don't think he did it. Well, you're the one that found the drug in his cabinet. I know, but there are people with stronger motives, like Natalie's sister and the boyfriend. I think we should be looking at them, too. We? Sorry, I got lulled into thinking we were a team again. You kinda have a knack for this crime thing. You thinking about joining the crime beat? You know that's my dad's thing. But I am realizing how much I love a good mystery. Solving a puzzle, piece by piece. Can't imagine what the victim's family's going through. Yeah, that's the toughest part of the job. Finding justice for them, you know. Is that why you became a detective? Yeah, definitely. But my grandfather was a cop. He still around? No, he passed a couple years ago, when I was in New York. Your mom said something happened there. It was a bank robbery. A woman was being held at gunpoint. I, asked the perp to take me instead. What happened? He got spooked and fired his gun. She didn't make it. That's terrible. It was a wake-up call for me. It made me realize what really matters. So I moved home. How about you? You ever leave Seattle? Pathetic, right? You kidding me? You're on the news, you're making a difference. I know, but some of my stories are pretty trivial. Okay, but how about that little boy? I mean, you got him experimental surgery. You saved his life. You saw that? Yeah, it was amazing. Seems like you really put everything into your career. So how about you? You have anyone special in your life? Not anymore. Um, I, um... I was engaged a few years ago. And? In my heart, I knew it wasn't right. I couldn't go through with it. You? Similar story. Didn't quite have a fairytale ending. Maybe you and I are more similar than I thought. One cherry pie. Two forks. You are so bad, Kiki. So bad. Thank you. You gotta get in here, though. I am so getting in here. I'm here live, on Mountain Crest Road, and we have breaking news in the death of Natalie Billings, founder of Natalie's All Naturals. Billings was found last week, here, in what was believed to be an accident. But detectives are now investigating this as a homicide and are searching for a dark-colored SUV... Caught on surveillance video. Sources say Billings was poisoned and I've learned that a local artist is being brought in today for questioning. The Roscoe file and make sure that we have that al... You. And you promised me you wouldn't do this to me again, Frank. It's not his fault. I went off-script, Ruby. The competition got their hands on the story and I had to run with it to get it on first. So you jeopardize my relationship with the lead detective? I don't know what to tell you. He needs to run a tighter ship. My scoop came from my sources in the P.D. And you're okay with this, with Todd on the slimebeat? Ruby, I'm sorry. I have to go. So did you make Natalie Billings a smoothie the day she died? -Yes. Like I always do. Did she seem sick to you? -Yeah, but it wasn't just that. She seemed... She seemed sad. Any idea why? I'd seen her get into it with her sister before class, but I couldn't hear what they were saying. I just picked up on the body language. I'd noticed some tension between them recently, though. I was told that you had some tension with Natalie. I mean, she rejected your painting. You two had a little argument, didn't you? -Yeah. Yeah. But it was no big deal. It was... You know, just a painting. Hey, you must've been embarrassed. I-I mean, she criticized your art, right? All due respect, that woman didn't know art. Was she the older woman you were seeing at the studio? No. Are you on any prescription drugs? I heard on the news that Natalie got poisoned. Is that what this is about? Yeah. She was likely poisoned by something in her smoothie, and by someone who drives what appears to be the same make and model as your SUV. We have you on tape, leaving the studio right after Natalie. Where'd you go after that? I went home to paint. I was there all night. Can anyone vouch for you? No, I was there by myself. Did you kill Natalie Billings? No! I want my lawyer. Natalie was one of the most selfless people I've ever known. She chose to use her financial successes, not on herself, but on a myriad of worthy causes, most notably Oceans Aware. I think it was growing up on the Puget Sound with her sister, Kate, that inspired her love of the water and nature. And we bonded over our mutual passion for natural remedies. She wanted to heal the world. And I think it's safe to say she inspired every one of us. She will be greatly missed. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. It was beautiful. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you for coming. It was a beautiful eulogy, Amanda. I thought you should know, that we are going to proceed with the gala, in honor of Natalie's memory. I'm so glad. I look forward to it. Who is that woman? That's Natalie's housekeeper. She seems to be taking the death very hard. They must have really connected. Will you excuse me? I'm gonna say hello to Kate. -Of course. Kate. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. Natalie was a very special woman. Are you okay? It seemed like that man was bothering you. That's just, Steve being Steve. If you'll excuse me. Of course. No, we are not doing this again. I had nothing to do with it. Awfully convenient. Your station broke the news. I've known Ruby my whole life. She's as trustworthy as they come. I'm sorry. I can't take any more chances. Sorry, Ruby. I hope you know that I want the same thing you do. From what I can see from the tissue, her last dose of colchicine might've been the fatal one... but it wasn't the only one. She was slowly poisoned. For how long? About a week, but I can't say with 100% accuracy. So the killer must have had access to her every day. Most likely. Hi. Can I help you? Sarah? Yeah. I'm Ruby Herring. An acquaintance of Natalie's. I'm doing a story for Channel 57. Come in. So, did you cook for her, too? I did everything. Her meals had to be all organic. She had such high standards. You must be an amazing cook. Well, that's kind of my thing. Did you make her smoothies, too? Of course. Every day. She was more than a boss. We were kindred spirits. Did you work for her long? No. Not too long. I worked for her sister first. Really? Why did you leave? Let's just say that Kate isn't the easiest person to get along with. Yeah, I heard the sisters didn't get along either. They definitely had their ups and downs. Did they fight? Yeah. Couple of weeks ago, they had a really big one. About what? I'm not sure exactly. I try not to eavesdrop, but... it was about their boyfriends. Kate's relationship with the shipping guy was really stressing Natalie out. Rupert Waldrin, the one who was polluting the ocean? Yes. What did you feel about Steve? I thought he was a little cold. Natalie was so warm. I guess opposites attract. Kate was concerned that Steve was after her money. But, funny thing, Steve was concerned that Kate was after her money. Natalie was definitely her personal piggy bank. Kate hit some hard times. She had to ask her sister for money. It was humiliating for both of them. -I'm sure. Did you tell the police any of this? They only asked to take a look around. They had a couple of questions and I told them what I knew. They took her computer and some paperwork. Didn't even look in her safe. She has a safe? We need powder. I once did a story about thieves figuring out garage codes. Maybe their tricks could work on a safe. Maybe this'll work. See that? Those four numbers make up the code. Like magic. But there must be thousands of combinations. Yeah, but we've really narrowed it down now. It's gotta be a birthday or an address, something like that. When's Natalie's birthday? October 25th. Kate's? August... something. No. What's the address to this house? 3121. 3-1... 2-1. Okay. When did she start her company? 2013. You're good. Well, here we go. This looks like a will. The things you learn on the job. This will is dated two years ago. Looks like she left just about everything to Kate. This one's dated two weeks ago. Is that around the time the sisters were in a big fight? Yeah. Well, looks like she left most everything to Oceans Aware. She cut Kate completely out of this one. Looks like $1 million went to Steve, and a million dollars to you. Me? Looks like you just became a very wealthy woman. Jake, did you get the photo of Natalie's will I sent over? Yes, and I have it already. The one from two years ago? How'd you get that? I'm waiting on Natalie's old attorney to send it to me. I went to visit the housekeeper. Turns out Natalie had a safe. And it was open? Not exactly. I'm not even gonna ask. The housekeeper said that the girls were at each other's throats when the new will was drawn up. Maybe Natalie told Kate she was cutting her out. Yeah, but did it make her angry enough to kill? I guess I got to bring her in. What about the housekeeper, Sarah? She drives a gray SUV, and a million dollars is a big motive. Yeah. Sure is. That's why I got one of my guys checking out her alibi. And Steve? Well, he never showed up for his interview. This job is like herding cats some days. Yeah. All right, well, I have to go, Ruby. All right, thanks for your help. Call Angela. 57 News. Hey, Ange, did you find out any info on Steve McClurren? Already done. So, according to Washington State medical board, he lost his medical license due to insurance fraud, but it was reinstated not too long ago, and... get a load of this. He filed for bankruptcy last year. Bingo. Motive. Does he have social media? Yes. And he has a standing tennis match... every week at the Balmoral Courts, which happens to be in 10 minutes. I'm on my way. Ho, ho, ho. Thanks. Good game. Thanks. Dr. McClurren? Yes. You're one heck of a tennis player. That forehand's like a bullet. -Thanks. Do I know you? Ruby Herring. 57 News. Um, you're the TV reporter. Um... "News we can use," right? Yes! Yeah. You're good. Catchy. So, what can I do for you? I'm doing a story on Natalie Billings. Did you know she left you a million dollars in her will? What? Are you serious? I... I had no idea. Nobody's contacted me. She must've cared about you a lot. We... We cared about each other. I, um, I read that you were listed as one of Seattle's top podiatrists. Yes. So you're clearly a great doctor, but you lost your medical license. Yes, and it was reinstated, due to a misunderstanding. Patient with a grudge. Well, that's terrible. Must be so hard being a doctor these days. Yeah. Tell me about it. I was curious, why didn't Natalie come to the medical conference with you? Did you two break up? No. She wasn't feeling well. In fact, she hadn't been for about a week. I told her to see a doctor, but she said it was nothing her herbal supplements couldn't fix. I feel so terrible. If I had known, I never would've gone to the conference. I heard her sister Kate's not your biggest fan. Well, she'd say anything to make me look bad. Look, I may not be the easiest guy, but Natalie... she was the yin to my yang. She was perfect for me. That's so sweet, and I'm sorry, but you have to know that it doesn't look good that you didn't show up for your police interview. Look, you, and they, need to stop looking at me, and think about where the rest of Natalie's money is going. Hey! Everything okay? Who are you? Detective Killian. Well, unless I'm under arrest, I'm leaving. No? Okay, then. Wait, wait. I... I just... just want to talk. Okay, what were you thinking? He has motive. He's not exactly high on my suspect list. Cameras on Interstate 5 caught him traveling to and from the Vancouver conference before and after Natalie's death. And the day she took her fatal dose, he was talking to hundreds of people. He's got more witnesses than I can count. So why are you here then? Well, the guy's got skeletons. I want to talk to him face-to-face, you know, rule him out, but that's not possible anymore 'cause of you. But you're the one who spooked him. What about the housekeeper? I cleared her. She was at some crystal convention. And Kate? She was at her house alone. No solid alibi. Killian. Yeah? Okay. Yeah, okay. Got it. What is it? An anonymous tip just came in. Well, what is it? I can't tell you, Ruby. Fine, then I'll follow you. Did anyone tell you you're relentless? Someone may have told me that before. Yeah? So what are we doing at a marina? Well, Roger has a boat here, and the tipster said there was something we'd be interested in. Don't you need a warrant? I called on the way over. Apparently, Picasso's boat has been repossessed. He hasn't paid rent on his slip for over six months, and the marina owner gave me permission to come aboard. Cute. Here it is. Nice boat. Classic sloop design. Fiberglass hull. Reverse transom. Betcha she can get up to eight, nine knots. So, what exactly are you looking for? Well, honestly, I have no idea. But tell me how a guy slinging smoothies can afford a 28-footer? Remember, he worked for a software company before he quit to become an artiste. Right. How do you know so much about boats anyway? My grandfather had a sailboat. Used to go all the time as a kid. I grew up sailing. A man of many talents. Hey, nothing better than a warm day and a strong breeze. Did you find anything? Well, just paint supplies down here. If this is Natalie's smoothie cup... we might've found our smoking gun. But please, let me test this first, before you report anything. Don't you think that was a little too easy? Yeah, yeah. But I can't ignore it either. Jake gets a tip and like magic, the cup appears. Well, it certainly fell into his lap, but, sometimes, that's how these cases are solved. What killer keeps evidence like that? It's a tricky one, that's for sure. So they believe he poisoned her with his own medication? That's the theory. Well, maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but you've chased down every lead you could, right? I wish I knew more about the sister. It had to infuriate her, being cut out of the will. And Natalie was paying the bills, she had the most to lose. Do you think she did it? Can't find any proof yet. There is one other thing that's bothering me. Yeah? What's that? Well, if the boyfriend and the housekeeper got two million from the will, that leaves 23 million to the charity. Who's in charge of the charity? You read my mind. Natalie's C.O.O., Amanda Kelly, is, for now. She could be a suspect. She seems to care so much about Natalie. Then again... that is a lot of money to suddenly have at your fingertips. -True. The gala's tomorrow night, right? Maybe you could talk to her. Yeah, I will. Just wanna check something out first. Hello there. - Hi. - You ready to order? - Sure. - Yeah, um... I'll have the burger, Kiki. Burger? I wouldn't have predicted that. The usual. Thanks, Kiki. You're on. My turn. I am so glad you have an MBA. This is all Greek to me. Anything strange standing out yet? Well, there was something... Oceans Aware has some huge payouts listed as "consulting fees." Is that a big deal? Well, not for private companies, but this is a charity. Lucky for us, charities have to have all their financials public. So where are the payouts going? Some company called "Coral Shore Enterprises." Found it... but there's barely any information. And they don't make any products, as far I can see, and there's only one employee listed. Somebody named "A. Sloane." Does it ring a bell? Not exactly... but I have a hunch. Follow it, and I'll keep digging. Cagney and Lacey, right? Ruby, hi. What brings you by? I wanted to see how you're doing. That's really sweet of you. Well... tonight's gala is keeping my mind off things. Well, it should be a nice night. -Please, come in. Thanks. I apologize for the mess, I'm doing a little packing. I noticed. Are you moving? Yes. Sweet little condo with an ocean view. This house is far too much for me. Can I get you some lemonade? -That'd be great. Ruby? Lemonade's ready when you are. Sorry, couldn't help but notice, you're an incredible gardener. Well, I love my plants and herbs. Just like Natalie. Roger's arrest really threw me. -It was a shock to everyone. And to kill someone over a painting? You'd think an artist would be used to rejection. He does have quite the temper, though. And had access to her that no one else did. I mean, bringing her those smoothies every morning? Was the smoothie reported on the news? I'm not sure. I think maybe Kate mentioned it. Sorry. It's work. They want me to come in. On a Saturday. Sorry. -It's okay. Thank you. Before I go, would you happen to have a program for tonight? I just might. Let me check. - Thanks. - Sure. Found one! Perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. And I'll see you tonight. See ya. I know that look. I think you might have the wrong man. Someone by the name of "A. Sloane" has been getting money from Oceans Aware for consulting fees. Right. And? And I think it's Amanda. Her full name is "Amanda Sloane Kelly." And get this, I was just at her house, and I found what looks like autumn crocus in her backyard. Colchicine comes from this plant. Look, Ruby. We got a warrant on Roger's studio and we got the colchicine pills, legally, from his medicine cabinet, and the cup from his boat tested positive for the drug. It matched the smoothie stain in Natalie's car. Yeah, but I think Amanda planted the evidence. And her white SUV had a small patch of blue. I think she painted it. Look, everything you're saying sounds suspicious, I don't doubt that, but it's out of my hands now. The D.A. knows it's a direct slam-dunk to Roger's case. What about Roger? His SUV, was it a match? Doesn't appear to be. That's not enough to let him go? Well, the D.A. doesn't think the SUV angle will hold up in court, because we're not 100% sure it's his. I wish we were both more convinced, but... that's the system. The system stinks. Look, I'm sorry. Thank you for all your help on the case. I got to go. Jenny, whatcha got? Coral Shore Enterprises is definitely funneling money from Oceans Aware. The hypocrisy of that woman. The money's been going to an account in the Maldives. You know, the U.S. has no extradition treaty with that country? I bet Amanda's planning to leave after the gala. All right. I got to go. You're the best, Jenny. Bye. Ruby, stunning. You have got to come see this garden. I'm a little busy. Come on, you need to smell the roses more. Wow... Aren't these gorgeous? Are you still working? I'll explain later. We should go mingle. Derek, could you get me a glass of wine? -Of course. Ruby, hi. I'm so glad you could make it. - What a lovely night. - Isn't it? I have to make a speech. Wish me luck. -Good luck. Can I have everyone's attention for a moment, please? Come on in. Gather around. First of all, I want to thank all of you for coming tonight. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Amanda Kelly. I'm the Chief Operating Officer of Natalie's All Naturals, and the interim President of Oceans Aware. It's kind of a bitter-sweet night for our Oceans Aware family, isn't it? Many of you may know that this was always Natalie's favorite event of the year, and it's also our biggest fundraiser. And thanks to you and your generosity, it's our biggest fundraiser ever. Here you go. You know what? Can you hang on to that for me, Derek? Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. I'm sorry. I'll be right back. I'm think of heading home. I promise, I'll call. Going somewhere? Excuse me? Do you always carry your passport with you, or just when you're traveling to the Maldives? -I-I don't understand. I saw it in your purse. You went through my purse? I know you stole the millions that Natalie left to Oceans Aware. That's ridiculous. You transferred the money to a shell company. "Coral Shore Enterprises" ring a bell? -I... It doesn't, actually. Derek! Have you seen Amanda Kelly? I just saw leaving the party, out back. Ruby was following her. Okay, great. Thanks. And I don't know where you're getting all of this nonsense from, Ruby, but... Unfortunately for you, all charities have to make financial transactions public. But that's the least of your worries. You killed Natalie and I have proof. That's offensive. She was my best friend. It hit me earlier today when I was in your backyard, and I saw autumn crocus. You grew it in your garden and used it to poison Natalie. Natalie was poisoned by Roger's colchicine. That's funny... the name of the drug was never mentioned. Okay, I don't know what's gotten into you, Ruby, but I've heard enough. I don't have to take this anymore. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. You've got the wrong person. Roger Davis killed Natalie. I know you two were dating. And you framed him for Natalie's murder. I'm not admitting to anything. And you painted your SUV white to cover your tracks. Amanda Sloane Kelly... you're under arrest for the murder of Natalie Billings. - Come on. - You're making a mistake. Roger killed Natalie. Only 57 News has the story behind the murder of Natalie Billings. Ruby Herring, who helped crack the case, is here now with the exclusive. Ruby, incredible story. Linda, it was an investigation filled with twists and turns, and ended with a shocking conclusion at the prestigious Oceans Aware Annual Charity Gala. Nice report. Thanks for the exclusive interview. You're a man of your word. I try. You know, I never got a chance to ask you... How did you figure out that Roger was seeing Amanda? Well, after I confirmed the petal you gave me was indeed an autumn crocus, I told Roger that you found it at Amanda's, and that you believed in his innocence. That made him talk. And turns out, two weeks ago, he dumped Amanda, so that made him the perfect patsy. What about Amanda's car? Well, initially, when I went to her place to ask her more questions, I saw a white SUV in her driveway, and I stupidly didn't check for the car registration. even detectives sometimes make mistakes. So how did you figure it all out? Well, when you mentioned that you saw blue paint on Amanda's SUV, I checked her DMV records. Turns out her vehicle was blue. So do you think you have enough to make the murder charge stick? Well, the case is circumstantial but solid. And we also have a forensic accountant who is looking into the sketchy charity financials. As far as I'm concerned, she's done. Look at us, solved another murder. And just to think, I only sort of needed rescuing. Well, you can hold your own, but I'm always here just in case you come across any more crazy killers. Did somebody say "killer"? No! I noticed you're back to vanilla? I needed some predictability after the week I've had. You know, I think you may be an even better crime reporter than I was. Hardly, Dad. No, I'm serious. You're a heck of a sleuth, Ruby Herring. Thanks, Kiki. Thanks. I just connected the dots and the dots happened to lead me to a killer. It's about love or money, right? Yep, and you figured it out, just like I knew you would. I learned from the best. Does this mean... The crime beat? -Yeah? Million-dollar question. There's still time to figure that out, Dad. 'Kay. Let me help you with that. That looks nice. Thank you, John. It looks good. Officially yours. Your first house! So exciting! I can't wait to start working on the garden. Well, just don't plant any autumn crocus, okay? Aloe vera, on the other hand, is always good to have around. Aw, thank you. Aw! You like him. Nice house. Well, I had the best realtor looking out for my best friend. Speaking of Jenny, I brought her a housewarming gift. - Do you mind? - No. It's actually a doorbell with a security camera. The perfect housewarming gift from a detective. Your mom said that there was cake inside. Did you bake it? Maybe. - I love a baker with a badge. - Yeah? Come on.
