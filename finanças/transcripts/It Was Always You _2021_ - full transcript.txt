This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. I thought we talked about flossing at your last visit. I floss. I don't think so. One of these might have to come out. Denise, would you mind calling Dr. Belling in here, please? Yes, Dr. Hall. Right away. Oh, I hear you and Dr. Belling are getting married. Two months from today. How did you two meet? Um, we were childhood friends. We fell out of touch after high school, but then, my first day of dental school, I walked into my Oral Pathology class, and sure enough, there he was. Some things are just meant to be. So where are you two going on your honeymoon? Honeymoon? Uh... we haven't actually talked about it. I think we've just been so busy that we haven't had time to plan anything. My wife and I just took a six-week tour through South America. Hiking in the Andes, Machu Picchu, and we went ziplined over the Inca Trail. I highly recommend it. Sounds fun. Although, I'm not sure that's something Dr. Belling and I would do. George doesn't really like roughing it outdoors. Oh... It's just something you have to try once in your life. It's like I told my wife, you don't regret the things you do, you regret the things you don't do. Like flossing. Denise! Thanks again for your work today with Mrs. Gibson's crown. It was outstanding. Oh, thank you, Dr. Belling. That was a lot of fun. It was, wasn't it? Well, have a great time on your vacation. Oh, it won't be vacation. No? I thought you were going to the island to visit Dr. Belling's family? We are. But we are way too busy to think about having anything that even remotely resembles a vacation while we are there. Our engagement party is in a week, and we still have a lot of wedding planning left to do. I'm sure it will go smoothly. You have been working on that wedding itinerary for months, Dr. Hall. Thank you, Denise. Oh, George, I almost forgot to tell you. I changed something on the itinerary. I had to move our meeting with the florist to 10:15, which then bumped the cake tasting to 11:45. Is that okay with you? -Works for me. -Great. Oh, and one more thing. I bought your mother a lovely blanket for her birthday. Cashmere. So we can give it to her at her party. Right. The surprise party. Shh. Remember, only you, me, and your sister know, so don't tell anyone, because we don't want your mother finding out. Of course. See you tomorrow. [♪♪] So, who's helping you plan everything on the island? George's mom and sister. I think you met Diana and Louise once. How is Louise? She's excited for the wedding. She recently moved home. -How come? -Bad break-up. I think she just needed a change of scenery. What about George's brother? Will he be at the party? David? I have no idea. He's probably off traveling the world somewhere. He keeps sending George these postcards from faraway places, like... hiking in Mozambique, or a camel ride through the pyramids. That sounds amazing. Is he cute? I have no idea. I haven't seen him in years. Imagine waking up every day to a new adventure. You ever think of something like that? When I was younger. Actually, I used to dream about going to Europe. My parents tried to plan this trip once, and they couldn't decide where to go, and I didn't want to spend the whole vacation listening to them argue, so I just asked if I could stay home and spend the summer on the island with George, Louise and David. That was a long time ago. And now I have my dental practice to worry about, and... let's be honest, George really hates to go anywhere new. Did you pack the extra phone charger? Got it. -Aspirin? -Check. So, Mr. Henry was telling me about this six-week expedition he and his wife went on to South America. -Oh, yeah? -Mm-hmm. They went hiking, ziplining. It actually sounded pretty amazing. Hmm. Sounds exhausting. Right. Well, I was thinking we might want to consider it for our honeymoon. A six-week honeymoon? What about our patients? I'm sure we could find someone to cover for us. Do you know how many people die every year on ziplines? No. Neither do I, but it's probably a lot. I'm sure you're right, George. [♪♪] Thank you for stopping. I know it wasn't on the schedule. We were almost at the house. I know, George, but the house will still be there. Come on. It won't be long. [♪♪] You folks, sit anywhere you want. I think they only serve raw oysters here. "Ring the bell, pick a pie." "Three dozen oysters, and your pie is on the house." [clanging] [cheering] You know that oysters contain toxins, and toxins can cause gastroenteritis. Yes, but Key lime pie does not. [waitress] Hey, folks. What can I get for you? Just a water with lemon for me, please. I would like one slice of Key lime pie, please. Oh, you can't have any pie unless you finish a platter of oysters. House rules. Oh. Well, what if I were to tell you that I have a shellfish allergy? I would tell you that you might enjoy Burger Hut up the street. Fine. I will have a glass of Chardonnay. Fancy. [clanging] [cheering] [clanging] [cheering] This place seems fun. Okay, here we go. No, no. No, no, no. I actually ordered a glass of Chardonnay. We don't have that. -You don't have Chardonnay? -No. And I am driving. Okay, leave that there then. Knock yourselves out. Can we leave now? [clanging] [cheering] [♪♪] [phone ringing] It's the office. I'd better get this. Oh, you'll be on the phone for hours. Come on, you're off the clock. I'm sure whatever it is, Denise can handle it. What if it's an emergency? Then she'll call Dr. Willis. George, please. Fine. Hey, Louise. Hello. Hello. Not going to give your brother a hug hello? Not now, George. I have to find my keys. [Elizabeth sighs] [George] Oh. Oh, but I will give Elizabeth one. Hi, Louise. Hello, Mother. Hi, Tilly! Oh, there she is. My soon-to-be daughter-in-law. It's so good to be here. I'm so happy to have you both. [cell phone ringing] They've tried calling me twice now. I really should get this. -George. -Two minutes, I promise. This is Dr. Belling. What's all this? Oh, Eugene dropped it off about a half an hour ago. It's for you. It's from some party store. Oh, those must be the decorations for the engagement party. They weren't supposed to arrive until tomorrow. I have it right here in my list. Well, I guess we're ahead of schedule. Oh, my. That is very detailed list, Elizabeth. I don't think I've met anyone quite as organized as you. Found them! Where are you off to, Louise? The airport. To pick up David. David's coming home? Yeah, well, word has it that he's... arriving early for the... surprise birthday party I'm not supposed to know about. No, no, no, no,no. Don't worry. No. I can act very surprised. I mean, don't forget I was the star of many high-school musicals in my day. Oh! Oh! A surprise? For me? Oh, you shouldn't have! Oh... you are-- you're pretty good. I know. I think I missed my calling. How's your room? Mother has officially turned it into a museum. I wouldn't be surprised if she starts charging admission. You think your house is like a museum, don't you remember that horrible yellow wallpaper at my house across the street? I vaguely remember. I used to love coming over here. You all were so welcoming and kind. That was my escape. There was always something happening here. Including... those scavenger hunts your mom used to throw for us. Oh, those. "Oh, those"? They were fun. Maybe we should do one this weekend. Really, Elizabeth? We're adults now. Haven't we grown past all of that? I suppose so. Oh... look at the treehouse your dad built. Peter was so handy. Still, it's amazing it's up. George? Hmm? You know, it's all right to talk about him. It still feels like he was just here yesterday. I just wish he could have lived long enough to see what I've done with my career. He would have been so proud of you. -Good morning. -Good morning. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to give you a proper hello yesterday. I was running around like crazy. No, it's fine. How did everything go picking up David? Oh, fine. You know David. I picked him up at the airport, and the minute we drove over the bridge, he insisted on getting out and walking. He got up early and went into town this morning. It's been so long since he's been home. Yeah, I don't think he's gonna stay for very long. You don't think so? You know David. He's a wanderer. A free spirit traveling the globe, looking for his next big adventure. I doubt that there's anything in Echo Beach that's gonna keep him here for very long. [knocking] [door opens] Hello, Louise. Hi, Eugene. Elizabeth, great to see you back on the island. Hi, Eugene. Louise, that band I was telling you about-- they're playing at the Brewery this Sunday. Would you like to... Sorry, Eugene. I'm just really busy. Oh. Well. Right. Of course, if you change your mind... [Louise] Really busy, Eugene. Sorry. Catch you later. Thanks. See you tomorrow. -Bye, Eugene. -See you, Elizabeth. What? What's that look for? He likes you. [laughs] Don't be ridiculous. Eugene's a mailman. He likes everyone. No, he likes you. Please, Elizabeth. That ship has sailed for me. Come on, Louise. You've got to give love another chance. With Eugene? Why not? Well, because. Because why? Because... because I don't even know how much a first-class stamp costs. That's why. That's your reason? It's perfectly valid. Have you ever stopped to think... that Eugene McClain of the U.S. Postal Service might just be your soulmate? He could be the one who completes you. Well... I think that a soulmate should be someone that inspires you to complete yourself. Okay. I've got to go pick up the ice cream for your mom's surprise party. Oh, she is going to be so surprised. Yeah. Thank you for doing that. You don't mind? No. I love going into town. You never know who you'll run into. [♪♪] -Hi. Welcome. -Thank you. What can I get you? I would like three pints of vanilla, please, but one of the pints I'd like in two separate containers. In one of the containers, I would like 1/4, in the other container, I would like 3/4. Then I would like two pints of chocolate, but I want a half pint separated into two individual cups. Then I would like three pints of strawberry distributed the exact same way as the vanilla. -Right. Uh... -Okay-- I've got a typed-up list for you, if you like. Double spaced. What's your name, my friend? [employee] I'm Ricky. What's up, bro? Can I get a pint of the Chocolate Belly Booster, please? Yeah. Thanks, man. Hi, David. Oh, hi, Elizabeth. How are you? Bring it in. Oh... It's okay. So... David Belling, back from his latest adventure. Here I am. And how does it feel to be home? Feels good. Yeah. Amazing, actually. I'm really excited to catch up with everybody. Hmm. Congratulations on the wedding. Very nice to hear about you and George. Thank you very much. I've got to know. How did old Georgie pop the question? Oh! Well, um, we were sitting in the break room at the office, and we looked at each other and thought we get along great, we're very similar, our practice is thriving. It just seemed like the most logical time to do it. Sensible. Exactly. Thank you, David, for understanding. -Of course. -After all, life doesn't need to be a romance novel. No. Who needs romance? So, how long do you intend to be home? Not very long. I've been teaching at a school in Mumbai and I promised my students I'd be back soon, so... probably right after the engagement party. Well, you will be missed. That was a very nice thing to say. [Ricky] Hey, so, it's going to be $37.95 for the pints. I got this. Oh, no, no, no. You don't need to do that. Sure, I got it. Richard, you wouldn't happen to take Yen or Rupees, would you? I don't think so. I got it. Thank you. I'll get the next one, okay? Thanks, buddy. So is that a lucky charm? You don't recognize it? I do not. It's yours. You used to have it on your backpack all through middle school. So how did you end up with it? Funny story. When we were about 12 years old, me, you, Louise, George, we went to the movies. I was being myself, as I am, but you decided to report me to the usher for speaking. Oh, I am sure I didn't do that. Oh, you most certainly did. And while you three were walking off into the sunset, and I was being accosted by security, this rabbit's foot fell off your bag. I picked it up. I was going to give it back to you, but then I thought to myself... "No." Wow, David. I'm so sorry that I annoyed you that day. "Annoyed" is a bit of a strong word, but... you used it. Napkins? Do you realize the hundreds of annoying things you used to do on a daily basis? No. But you should have said something. I did! You just don't remember! Well, that just sounds very plausible. How about this-- let's take this opportunity for you to get off your chest all the things I ever did to annoy you. Let me have it. How much time do you have? Alright, there was the time your dad drove us to get a Christmas tree. You yelled shotgun, ran ahead of everyone, and made us wait outside the car for over an hour. -I did that. -Mm-hmm. Or July 4, 1997. Do you remember what happened that day? Fireworks? You snatched the fries off of my plate and stole my soda. Wow. What a monster. Just a thought-- -1997 that was? -Uh-huh. Maybe you should let that one go. See you back at the house, David. Bye, Lizzie. Alright. Shh, shh, shh. She's coming. Gran, come here. You've got to hide. Yeah, come on. [door opens] Surprise! Oh! I can't believe it! What a surprise! Somebody told her. Yes, they did. It was-- It was me. [Louise] David! How could you? I'm a terrible person. What do you want? [laughing] You know, you don't have to take the blame for something that you didn't do. Ah, so it was you who spilled the beans. Tsk, tsk, tsk. You know, come to think of it, you would have been my most likely suspect. Naughty. Thank you. Thank you, all, for this wonderful surprise. My wish was that Peter could see us all together having such a marvelous time. He's right here with us, Mom. If I could just take a minute to talk about my wonderful children... Oh, get ready for the annual "why I'm so proud of my children" speech. I mean, just look at my extraordinary son, George. Getting married to the most wonderful girl. I mean, the Belling family has been in love with Elizabeth for it seems like forever. And George and Elizabeth's dental practice is just thriving. [cell phone buzzing] Excuse me. Hello? This is Dr. Belling. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. I want to say how proud I am of my amazing daughter, Louise. An award-winning artist. And my truly remarkable son, David. Travels the globe, teaching children in need. You're such a good man. Thank you. Very kind. If you ask me... Here we go... David needs to stay in one place and get married like his brother. I got married at 18. What's your problem, mister? [David] It's a fair point, Gran. The answer to that is I just can't find someone as special as you. Yeah, yeah, always the charmer. You, listen to me. Yes, Ma'am. Love is not something you find. Love is something that finds you-- when you least expect it. George, what is it? Oh, it's Mrs. Valenzuela. She says she has an unbearable toothache. Well, can't Dr. Willis handle it? You know Mrs. Valenzuela and her dental anxiety. She had such a bad experience with her last dentist. Her son said she'd only see me. Well, I don't blame her. I can't think of a more brilliant dentist to handle whatever problem she's having. Well, I'll only be gone the night. I've scheduled for her to come in first thing in the morning. Will you survive without me? Mm. I'll try. I'm going to grab my things. [thunder rumbling] Alright, go inside. Hello, Tilly. Big storm coming, George. Think so? Oh, yeah, look at those clouds. [storm rumbling] Drive safe, okay? Thank you. Hold down the fort. I will. Hey, George? I read that... that article that you wrote in the dental magazine. What did you think? It thought it was really interesting, especially the part about how oral infections in childhood could actually increase the risk of that... that thing in adulthood. You mean atherosclerosis? That's the thing. That's the thing. I thought it was very cool how you figured that out. Well, you didn't understand a word, did you? No, not a word, but... that does not make it any less impressive, buddy. You're impressed? Of course. I'm very proud of my big brother. Well, I'm... I'm very proud of you, too, you know? Oh, I gotta hear this. Go ahead. Sometimes, I... I wish that I could be as-- liberated as you, and just take off and live day by day, as life comes. Well, okay. I'll book tickets right now, George. Where do you want to go? Come on, why not? Well, that's just the thing. See, I'm not a why-not kind of guy. I'm the guy that just asks why. Almost had you. Did. Almost. -You were gonna come. -Almost. Have a good night, David. You too, buddy. Safe drive, okay? Thank you. [car engine starting] [thunder crashing] [loud rock music playing] What is going on? [loud rock music playing] I can't believe this. [loud rock music playing] [loud rock music playing] [David singing] David! David? [loud rock music playing] Cake? No, I do not want any cake! Do you realize it's 2:00 in the morning? I'm surprised you haven't woken up the whole-- You seem a little tense, Lizzie. I am tense! Because I was just woken up by David's one-man rock band! Well, since you're up, why don't I get you a little something? You could get me something. You could get me turning down the music because some of us are trying to sleep. You're absolutely correct. Some apology milk. I'm sorry. I'm still on Tibetan time. Well, the rest of us are not on Tibetan time. The rest of us are trying to maintain our usual eight and a quarter hours of sleep per night. [pop music playing] That is a very specific amount of time, Elizabeth. [music playing] I love this song! Isn't it so good? It just makes you want to dance. No, I do not love that song. Feel free to help yourself to that cake, alright? I'd rather not. Okay, fell free to join me in a dance. I'm gonna be over here dancing. [♪♪] David, it is 2:00 in the morning. I want to go to sleep, I do not want to have a dance party, and I do not want to eat peanut-butter cake. Hold on, now. Is there peanuts in that? Yes. What's the matter with you? Can't you taste them? [David clears throat] No. You're funny. No. [clears throat] That's not funny, David. [David gags] David! David! David, are you okay? David, wake up! Wake up! -Wake up! -Shh. I'm trying to sleep. [rages] Is that your idea of a joke? More of a performance piece, really. You think it's funny to make me believe you're dead? I was going for unconscious, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a very good actor. You have been trouble from the very start. You take nothing seriously. You break all the rules-- and I don't like rule-breakers! So here's what we're going to do, David. We're going to keep our distance for the rest of the time you're home. We're going to be like two ships passing in the night. That's poetic. I'm sorry. [George] Excuse me. What's going on here? [man] Lightning struck the bridge. [engine revving] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? You can't cross the bridge. Island's closed. Inspector should be here shortly, to let us know how the assessment's going. Is there much damage? Well, far as I can tell, the lightning looks like it might have got the kingpost, some of the framing braces, probably 10 or 12 transoms. Huh. I see. Well, then I will just wait here until the repairs are done. Alright. Suit yourself. Could be three or four days, maybe even a couple weeks. Two weeks? I-- No, I need to get across the bridge today. My engagement party is on Friday, and I promised to meet my fiancée today so that we could meet with the... the florist, and the rental company, and the wedding-cake designer. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you and your fiancée, but you two lovebirds are gonna have to plan your wedding from this side of the bridge. Hmm. Hmm-hmm! Good morning, Tilly. How are you? [Tilly groans] Well, I'm good. Thank you for asking. How did you sleep? How did I sleep? Oh, I slept like a baby. How about you? What's your name? [Tilly groans] Tilly. Shh. You're right there. She can hear you. [scoffs] [phone rings] -[Elizabeth] Hello? George? -[George] Hello? [Elizabeth] You're breaking up. I can't hear you. The bridge? Did you just say lightning strike? [static, garbled conversation] Hello? George? You're breaking up again. I can't hear you. [static, garbled conversation] Did you hear about a lightning strike on the bridge? Yes. So why didn't you tell me? Two ships passing in the night, right? [♪♪] Oh, hi. Need a ride? No thank you. Are you sure? Looks like you've got a lot of junk in your hands. It isn't junk. It's important research. I'm planning a wedding, you know? Oh, I do know. I also know George has got your car, so why don't you hop in, I'll take you wherever you want to go. I'm just going to the florist, only a few blocks away. Perfect. I'll get you there in two minutes. I'm fine. Have a nice day. Look, Lizzie. Stop. You're marrying my brother. We're going to be family. For George's sake, how about you and I call a truce? For George? Alright. Truce. Well, hold on, now. Are you sure you don't want a ride? Okay, but only if you promise to stay inside the vehicle while I'm talking to the vendors. Deal? Deal. Hop in. [♪♪] [♪♪] Let's go for a walk. Good girl. Hey, hey, hey. Wait for me. So, as you can see from my notes and diagrams, I have a pretty clear idea of what I want the cake to look like. I see. A six-tier monochromatic cake, with sugar petals down the side, and then a single sugar pearl at the tip of each leaf. Lovely. We can do that. Great. Be with you in a minute, sir. I'm good. Thank you. Excuse me just one moment. What are you doing? -Is this lemon? -We had a deal. You were going to wait outside until I finished my meetings. Now, why don't you just sit down and... try not to interrupt. I can do that. I'm so sorry, Sylvia. Um... right. So I would like a vanilla cake. All vanilla. Nothing but vanilla. A lot of vanilla. Did you say something? No. Sorry to interrupt. You were saying how fond you were of vanilla. [sighs] I mean, imagine, if you will, a world where only vanilla exists-- no butterscotch, no coconut, no rocky road. I suspect in a vanilla world, oceans wouldn't get crossed, mountains never climbed, civilizations never discovered. Perhaps I'm being dramatic. Mm! This is not about Magellan discovering a new world. This is about my wedding cake. You're absolutely right. I apologize. I'm just gonna sit here. Um... where were we? Sugar petals. Right. Uh, sugar petals. So, the, um-- the floral-inspired decor would... um... You think vanilla is dull? I think vanilla is playing it a little bit safe. And from my observation, all the years that I've known you, Elizabeth, you do tend to play it safe. Maybe it's because you want people to think that you're a responsible, practical, safe person, but, deep down, I think you're actually a Neapolitan ice-cream sundae, with sprinkles, maybe even a little cherry on top. If you'd just let go once in a while, you might discover that you're not vanilla-- not at all. Sylvia... let's go with the vanilla. You got it. You think I'm dull, don't you? No. In fact, that's the opposite of what I was trying to express. Well, why don't you just say it? I won't be angry. You think my life with George is dull and uninteresting. At least compared to your life. Well... someone's gotta hold down the fort so us crazies can act out. Well, maybe... Nothing. No, go ahead. You started. Maybe what? Maybe, sometimes, I get a bit sick of holding down the fort. Maybe I don't wanna be just vanilla. Maybe I wanna be... chocolate and strawberry, too. Alright. [Elizabeth] Wait, where are we going? [David] You'll see. Hold on, Magellan. You're about to discover a whole new world. [bell clanging] [cheering] You've been here before, right? Once. You grew up here and you've only been to The Flying Otter Oyster Bar one time? Well, I don't know, David. I didn't plan it. Well, we're going to fix that. Sandy, my everything. Hey. Lizzie, Sandy. Sandy, Lizzie. [women together] We've met. Enjoy. Okay. You're gonna love this. We are going to finish this entire thing. The bell's gonna ring, and we're gonna have that pie. Come on. I believe in you. There it is. Bottoms up. How was it? Delicious, isn't it? Mm-mm. That's terrible. But I want that bell to ring. I want that pie. That's the spirit. Okay, here we go. Let's dig in. This is yours. Throw that one down. We're all done. A little for me. A little for you. Cheers. Here we go. ♪ All my life ♪ ♪ They told me "Don't do this"... ♪ [cheering] [♪♪] ♪ ..."You're just a girl You can't run the show" ♪ ♪ I said... ♪ [bell clanging] [David] Yup. Very nice. [cheering] -Congratulations. -And to you. I'm very proud of us. There she is-- right on time. -Well done. -Sandy. And there we go. Enjoy your pie. Thank you. There it is-- in all of its glory. Get ready. Here it comes. Is it all that you dreamed it would be? Mm. Nice. You got something right here. Oh. I'll get it. What? Do I have more cream? No, you don't. It's just crazy. What's crazy? You and George are getting married. Yeah. That's happening. What about you? You ever think about getting married? Me? No. Nobody special in your life? Never in one place long enough. Hmm. Have you ever even been in love? I mean, aside from Melanie Greenberg in the sixth grade? Oh, Melanie Greenberg. From her braces-- my poor little lips were never the same. I'm being serious. Don't you want to be in love? Get married? Start a family? The whole circle of life thing? Nothing about me goes in a circle, Lizzie. Or a straight line, for that matter. Okay. So you're just going to zigzag your way through the rest of your life? I don't know about all that, but... [music playing] I'm gonna zigzag my way over to that dance floor. Join me. No thank you. Come on, Lizzie. I'll zig, you zag. It's okay to cut loose and have a little bit of fun, Elizabeth. You can't leave me out here all by myself. You comin'? There she comes. There she comes. Elizabeth, ladies and gentlemen. Here she is! What's she gonna do? [♪♪] Oh, wow. It's like a solar eclipse. I can't look directly at it. Stop it! [phone ringing] [David] No. No, no, no. George is calling. Well, call him back. I should take it. One song. You were just getting into it. Two minutes, we'll call him right back. I can't believe you did that. You just told me to do that! How do you feel? Like I am breaking the rules. Twirly. We've got a troublemaker on our hands. We're going straight to prison. [♪♪] [knocking] -[Eugene] Hi, Louise. -Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting. No, no, not at all. Come on in. What do you think? I like it. Really? Yeah. I like what you did with the reflections on the water. [chuckles] You know, the other day, I noticed you were painting something with mallards, and, well, I remembered that my father had one of these, and I thought maybe it could keep you company. You know, like you artists say, for inspiration. Thank you. That's really thoughtful. Why don't you put it over there? -Here? -Yeah. Oh, that's perfect. Yes! Well... see you around, Louise. See you. Mm! Smells so good in here. -Hi, honey. -Hi. Hey, have you seen, Louise? Do you know, I think she's out in the studio with Eugene. Really? Oh, don't get too excited. Our Louise has sworn off relationships after two broken engagements. Oh, my gosh, look at the time. I've got to get this to mother. Why don't I take it for you? You don't mind? Sure. Besides, before you know it, she'll be my grandmother, too. Oh, Elizabeth. How wonderful to see you. Diana sent this for you. So much food. Who could eat so much food? [laughs] So how's the wedding planning going? It's been interesting. George got stuck on the other side of the bridge, so David has actually been dropping me off at my appointments. Let me tell you who's running that bridge. Nincompoops, that's who. [laughs] Want to know who else is a nincompoop? Who? My grandson, George. What? Imagine leaving a beautiful girl like you all alone on the other side of the bridge. Oh... It was Mother Nature. It wasn't George's fault. Why, if I were a young man, and I saw you, I'd sweep you off your feet and never leave your side. Is that what Grandpa Lou did? He swept you off your feet? Not exactly. Let me let you in on a little secret. Before I married Lou... I had a boyfriend. Oh! I didn't know about that. It's true. Martin Moretti. Know him? Mr. Moretti? The dry cleaner? Mm-hmm. That's him. We both grew up together. We used to loved sailing around the island. Going to see movies in town. And we just loved to go dancing. Boy, oh, boy, we were something else on that dance floor. Every move perfectly in sync. People used to say that Martin and I were a match made in heaven. So why didn't you marry him? Blah. Why would I want to marry someone who is exactly like me? All right, then how did you end up marrying Grandpa Lou? Well, you know, after we met, he really started to grow on me. Little by little. He challenged me. And that was a good thing. And with him, I found I could always be myself... the real Vivien, not to mention we had this wonderful connection. We used to call it "that zing". "Zing"? Well, it's just... a feeling. You can't force zing. And you can't deny it if it's there. Right. And even though Lou didn't like to sail, and he didn't like to dance... every time that man held me in his arms, I would just go weak in the knees. Like jello. Every single time. I'm sure like you and David. You mean like me and George? That's what I said. [♪♪] Every time I come in here, it reminds me of my dad. He used to read to us from that chair right there. One of my favorite childhood memories. -Really? -Mm-hmm. The best is when he read "Robin Hood". He did the greatest voice of-- [together] Friar Tuck. That's right. I loved the way he did those voices. Me too. Look at these places. China, India, Nepal. It's all so beautiful. So is that how you do it? You just spin the globe, and point to a place, and that's how you choose where to go next? It's a good start, no? The Himalayas. I wonder if, when you're in these faraway places, if you ever feel like there's a part of you that's missing? Sometimes, when I'm on the other side of the planet, I sleep and I do dream of... being home. Sometimes, I wake up, and I long to be back with the people I love, the people I left behind. That's why you're so lucky, Lizzie. I'm so lucky? Yes, you're very lucky. Oh. There is a part of me that wonders what it would be like to be that important person... for somebody else. And you have that. You're that missing piece that makes someone's heart whole, like you said. The truth is, you can climb the highest mountain... and swim the widest river... and still never find that. Oh, my goodness. It's still here. What? You've got to come see this. Do you remember this? [Elizabeth] How did you find this? [David] I watched you write that note when you were 13... right over there. Then I watched you stick it in this book. Of course, I had to come read it. I wanted to go to Rome so bad. [David] Mm-hmm. I thought maybe we'd go as a family, but then my parents split up. Look at all the places I wanted to go. Trevi Fountain. The Colosseum. The Sistine Chapel. Did you ever end up going? No. No? Come on, Lizzie, you've got to go-- what's stopping you? I just can't see that happening anytime soon. Maybe there's a piece of your heart that's missing, too. A piece of you that's in this list right here, that that girl wrote all those years ago. [♪♪] I gotta call George. Yes, of course. I'll leave you to it. Say hello to the man for me. [♪♪] [Louise] Where have you been? Inside with Elizabeth. Sorry. Lost track of time. [Louise] That's nice. What's nice? That you and Elizabeth are finally friends. You know, I think you bring out a different side of her. Oh, yeah? How so? I don't know. I mean, when she's around you, she's a lot lighter, and she's less Elizabeth and more Lizzie. Yeah, she's pretty great. I know. I've been telling you that for years. Well, don't you just know everything? Ha, ha. I bet you regret all those years when you and Elizabeth didn't get along. Yeah, between her lists, and my dancing and carrying on, we... thoroughly annoyed each other, but we're all adults now, we can move on from that. Well, good. I guess you and Elizabeth have found that thing that Grandma Vivien always talks about-- you know... that "zing". Grandma was talking about what she had with Grandpa Lou. I don't got a zing with Lizzie. I got a zing with nobody. I'm zing-less. Come on. George and Lizzie... they got a zing. Those two are perfect for each other. It's just an off-the-charts zing. [♪♪] [knocking] Hi, Eugene. You're working late. I don't mind. Louise, Eugene is looking tired. Perhaps he'd like some coffee? Oh, yeah. We just made a fresh pot. Would you like some? I'd love some. Thanks. Cream? Sugar? -Black is fine. -Okay. Have you eaten much today, Eugene? Not much. [Elizabeth] Ahem. Oh, we have some pie. Would you like a piece? I'd love one. Okay. It's apple. Oh, right. There you go. You made this? Oh, no, no, no. That was all Louise. You like it? I think it's the best pie I've ever eaten. I'm just going to... So, um... I've been meaning to ask you... how much does a first-class stamp cost? I'm glad you asked. I can't understand you when you're laughing like that. [George] And the Denise put the mouthwash... Denise put the mouthwash in the break-room refrigerator? Yes! Yeah, yeah, that's really funny. Yes, it is. [static] You're breaking up again. [garbled conversation, static] [sighs] I guess just call me back, George. [♪♪] [TV playing] Sorry, I didn't realize anyone was in here. Ever seen this movie? The best western ever made. Seen it probably a thousand times. It gets better every time. [♪♪] Would you like to watch something else? Um... there's this dating show that I like, and tonight the guy is supposed to propose to the girl that he chooses. We can watch that. Really? Yeah, sure. Why not? Have at it. [romantic music playing] [giggles] [man on TV] I've always believed that there's no time frame for love. Serena, I've fallen in love with you. [Serena] That makes me so happy that you've said that. I'm thankful for you, Chad. I'm ready to give myself... You're kidding, right? What? This isn't romance. What do you mean? What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? He doesn't even believe what he's saying. You don't think this is real, do you? Yeah, I kind of do. Okay. It's moving. They're both flight attendants. They have a lot in common. A bag of peanuts, in-flight magazines-- that's all they've got in common. What do you know about romance? Well, don't you come for me. I'm the most romantic guy you've ever meet. -Is that so? -That is so. Then how would you romance that girl? How would I romance her? -You really want to know? -Mm-hmm. Ooh. Let's see. I would take her on a boat. Out on the water. It would be sunset, of course. And I would take her in my arms, and I would say to her... "All I love, all I ever need, is you. Without you, my love, I am lost. Every time I look at you, I... I'm breathless. Every time I hold you in my arms, I feel like I am home. I loved you yesterday... I love you today... I love you tomorrow." [♪♪] What are you doing? [strikes a final chord] Serenading myself. Would you care to join me so it's less sad? No thank you. I was actually wondering if you could drive me into town again. I have another couple appointments. Of course. All I ask... is that you climb up here and join me. I said no thank you. My mom never wanted me in that treehouse. I don't think she trusted the ladder. Your mother was a smart woman. The only problem is, is that, sometimes, to find happiness, you gotta reach... for what's just beyond your grasp. Come on. I got a confession to make. I don't understand this whole wedding-registry thing. At all. You're just supposed to do it so that people can get you what you really want. Alright, well, if that's the case... if I was getting married, I would want... this. That's ridiculous. It is ridiculous. Do you know what else is ridiculous? The fact that you have a list that you're using to make another list so that people can buy you presents, apparently, from the goodness of their hearts, but only exists on those two lists. That's not really the point. Okay. Oh... Now, this... this is actually perfect. What's so perfect? A white, plain plate. That's how you want to celebrate your love? It's timeless. It's timeless, I'll give you that. Oh! Now, this... that's a wedding essential right there. Golden flying pigs? Yup. What am I supposed to do with those? A reminder that anything is possible. Pigs can fly. I don't know, Lizzie. They're fun. Look at them. They're cute. I'll have you know that when you were a kid, you were the one who would find the joy in all the little things. For instance, do you remember that ring that Louise gave you one year for Christmas. With the pearl? You didn't care about that ring, did you? All you cared about was that cute, little box that it came in. Oh, that was a thing of beauty. It was. She painted all those unicorns on it. I saved that for years. And the ring? No idea. Hmm. But that was a really long time ago. I believed in unicorns then. But people change. Yeah. Well, if it's all the same to you, I'm gonna hold on to my memory of that little girl... who believed in unicorns. [♪♪] [scanner beeps] Oh, good. You found the toasters. Okay. It says here you and Georgie-boy wanted a four-slice toaster. I changed my mind. I want a two-slice toaster. Okay. Sure. What about a crumb tray? It says here that... No. I like crumbs. Oh, yeah? I really, really like crumbs. And one more thing, David... not everything has changed. I still find joy in the little things in life. Like crumbs. So if a crumb is going to bring you joy, a crumb's what you should get. [beeping] Oh, my goodness! What have you done? What else do you want? I don't know. The world is your oyster. Take your pick. What's it gonna be? I want that. That's not on your list. I don't care. I want it anyway. -[beeping] -[David] Wow. Okay, what's next? Uh... this! I want whatever this is. That's a rabbit toilet-paper dispenser. Every home should have one of those. What's next? What else do you want? Come on. -This. -Show the people. What else do you want? [beeping] Sorry. The scanner slipped. I don't know what happened. It's okay. [♪♪] Now, lots to decide on for your wedding music. -[dog barking] -[woman] Joey, let the dog out! In a minute, Mom! I'm with clients! We need to decide on your entrance music, the father-daughter dance, the cutting-the-cake song, and, of course, the first dance. You said you have a list? You got your list? I-- I don't. I'm so sorry. I don't know what I did with my list. Want to go check the car? That-that's okay. I've got plenty of ideas for you two. -Oh, we're not engaged. -He's not my fiancé. Oh, sorry. That's okay. [Joey] I just assumed. Well, anyways, what do you think of this for your first dance? ["How Do I Live?" by LeAnn Rimes playing] [dog barking] [mom] Joey! The dog needs to go out! [Joey] Sorry. I'll be right back. [♪♪] ♪ How do I... ♪ ♪ Get through a night without you... ♪ [laughing] DJ Joey. Oh... I must have left my list at the house. We should probably head back.

Uh, I'm gonna need a 50% deposit up front. Not the time, Joe. -I'm gonna call you later. -Okay. And then he says, "Sure. I'll watch your dating show with you." Because, apparently, he knows all about romance. But trust me, I don't need David Belling telling me about romance. Are you gonna order a platter soon, because I'm supposed to take my break. Yeah. Sure. But what I really want is pie. Great. One platter coming up. I had my whole life figured out. Everything was written down on lists. But today, I lost my list. No oysters? Well, it kind of seemed like you could use a piece of pie today. Thank you. You're welcome. Don't worry. It's just pre-wedding jitters. I'm gonna marry George. Truth is, I didn't even know you could go weak in the knees until... Until George? Okay, I'm gonna go take my break. Enjoy that pie. [bell clanging] [cheering] [♪♪] Oh, where do you want this, Louise? Just with me is fine. Thanks. Oh, hey, Eugene. Um... thanks for helping me. My pleasure. [♪♪] Oh! Oh! Don't give up now. You've almost got it. I thought I was alone. Yeah, and I thought we were doing wedding stuff. May I make a suggestion? -No. -Okay. [Elizabeth moans] You okay? Fine. I can't do it while you're looking at me. Of course. Yes, ma'am. [Elizabeth] You know, I've been thinking. [David] What have you been thinking? Just everything that's happened since the bridge went down. For as long as I can remember, every aspect of my life has been planned. Get good grades. Go to college. Go to dental school. Marry George. Run my dental practice. It's all written down. What's wrong with that? I've just been thinking about that list you showed me-- in the book. All the places I wanted to see in Rome. And I found myself wondering, why haven't I been to any of those places? All George and I ever do is just work all day and go to conferences on weekends, and, and, and... And I know that for you, a trip is just a small thing, but-- Small things are the big things, and good things only happen from all the hundreds of tiny steps you take along the way. I need to start taking those tiny steps. With George. Sure. We need to take some time away from the practice, and... go to Rome. You can picture George at the Colosseum, right? Of course. I can picture that. Great! That's what I'm going to do, then. As soon as George gets here, I'm going to tell him about our new plan. Alright. But first I'm going to climb this ladder. Right. Take your time. You got it. Stay close. You got it. A little further. [Elizabeth] Oh, my goodness. Pull yourself over. [♪♪] How's the view? Amazing. [♪♪] -Oh! -Oh! Dr. Belling. Denise. Your sister called. The Echo Island Bridge is reopening tomorrow. Oh! That's good news. Yeah. Thank you, Denise. For what? Thank you for always putting in extra hours, even when not asked. Oh, well, it's my pleasure. Well, I imagine there's probably a thousand other places you'd rather be than here. Not really. I really enjoy my job, so, truthfully, there's no place I'd rather be. Uh-huh. So what is the sheriff doing? He's trying to catch the bad guys. Spoiler, he always does. Hmm, clever. You don't like this movie, do you? Shh. You can admit it. Hey. I spoke to Bob Dooley today. [together] Uh-huh? And the bridge is reopening in the morning. [together] Mm-hmm. So George'll be back soon. [power cutting out] [David] Nice. So will you be leaving once the bridge reopens? [David] No, no, no. I've gotta stay for the engagement party, right? Alright, I've told her to change this thing a million times, Mom. Wow, look at all these boxes. Geez Louise, Louise, that's a lot of them. Here's one of yours. What's in here? Oh, that is a lot of souvenirs and travel books. Can I see that book, please? Sure. Thank you. So have you really been to all these places? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. London, Amsterdam... Paris. After you and George go to Rome, you've gotta stop in Paris. Everybody's gotta see Paris once. Walk along the Seine River. Wander the streets of Monmarte. You've gotta stop at this little place in the 5th arrondissement that has the best profiteroles that you will ever have. They just melt in your mouth. What if George doesn't want to go to Paris? I mean, Lizzie, you talk a lot about George's plan and what he wants, but... I know George would want to do what you want to do, too. So what do you want? I want to go to Paris. Then you should go to Paris. What will people think? Lizzie, sometimes, the people around you aren't going to understand your journey. That's okay. They don't need to. It's not for them. Lizzie, maybe nobody's told you this before, but it's okay... for you to chase your own happiness. [power surges on] Et voilà. Bonne nuit. Goodnight. [♪♪] [♪♪] [George] Elizabeth! George. You're back! Are you alright? Yes. Yes. I was just about to go for a walk. Do you want to join me? Sure. Oh, I hope you don't mind, I registered us for a seminar in September at the University. Fixed metallic replacements versus dental implants. I couldn't resist. It sounded so fun. Yeah, sure, George. Whatever you want. Actually... while you were gone, I did some thinking, and, um... I think I've come up with a pretty fun plan for us. Another seminar? Not exactly. I think that we should put things on hold for a couple of months and travel the world. Elizabeth, I already said I do not want to go to South America. I have no interest in ziplining across the Andes. And this is certainly not the time to leave our practice. Okay, just hear me out, George. This could actually be the perfect time for us to do something like this. We don't have kids, we haven't bought a house yet. It could be the adventure of a lifetime. And we don't have to go to South America. We could... We could go to Rome. Did I ever tell you how much I've always wanted to see the Coliseum? And then we could go to Paris and eat profiteroles. Do I need to remind you that this fall we have a dental convention, three seminars, two lectures, and not to mention our patients, who, I assure you, will not be very happy to know that their dentists are galavanting across Europe. Sure. Sure. You're right. Just a crazy idea. Maybe someday we can go? Maybe someday, when we're very old and very grey, we'll go to Paris. Dance with me. What? I want to dance with you. Now? Yes. Now. Dance? Huh. ["How Do I Live?" by LeAnn Rimes playing] ♪ How do I... ♪ Are you sure you're alright? Yes.

[♪♪] When I was a young girl, there was no such thing as an engagement party. Back then, we just got married. No celebration. Gran, that can't be true. It's true. Lou and I were married in my mother's kitchen. There was no food, there was no music, no fancy party. No presents. Oh, Mother, please. No, there must have been some presents. No. My father gave us $5.00 and wished us good luck. I was married 57 years. What does that tell you? I'm not totally sure. If you ask me, the shorter the engagement, the longer the marriage. How long have you been engaged? Meatballs, Grandma? Oh! I thought you'd never ask. Elizabeth, would you like to go and dance? Yeah? Georgie? Oh, no, thank you, David. Alright, brother. Let's go! [♪♪] Elizabeth! Hi. Thanks again for the invitation. This place is amazing! Good. I hope you're having a good time. And who's this? David Belling. Abby. Abby, nice to meet you. Excuse me one moment. I'm going to put this down. So this is David? I guess she's going. Let's go! Come on. There it is. My goodness, there it is. I learned from the best. Don't you flatter me.

Mm-hmm. ♪ You are so beautiful... ♪ And I say, "Because we need to check for cavities and gum disease." And then she says, "Do I get a refund if you don't find any?" [laughing] Excuse me. George, may I speak with you for a moment? Uh, sure. Excuse me for a minute. George... I was hoping we could talk about the past few days. What about the past few days? [man] Hey, Georgie boy! How do I explain? Once upon a time, there was a lonely, little girl, who came from a broken family. And one day, this wonderful family moved in across the street. And they were fun and loving and kind. And they welcomed her with open arms. And since then, she's been trying to replicate this perfect family. This perfect life. What are you trying to say? I've had this one goal... and this one plan for how to get there. But I've discovered that sometimes life takes us to unexpected places. And that maybe having a plan for happiness isn't the same as just being happy. Well, I need to have a plan, Elizabeth. I know you do, George. And that's great. It is. I used to be that way, too. Used to? Ever since the bridge went down, I've realized that... I need to find out who I really am... and what actually makes me happy... without a plan. I see. And where does that leave us? [♪♪] Is there anything I can say to change your mind? Hmm. Well... I guess that's the point. If I have to convince you, then there is no point. George. Wait. Thank you for making every day we had together so perfect. [♪♪] [Louise] Have you seen David? He's gone. Gone? Gone for good? You know David. There's always another adventure on the horizon. Let's go sit by the fire. [♪♪] [♪♪] [Elizabeth] I can't believe I've been gone for a year, but every time I think about coming home, I find another place on the map. London is absolutely amazing. Today, I went to Big Ben. Miss you. Love, Elizabeth. Having the time of my life in Paris. Today, I ate the most incredible profiterole. See you soon. [♪♪] [Diana] "Mrs. Diana Belling requests your company at the marriage ceremony uniting Louise Belling and Eugene McClain." [♪♪] And now a very special song for the lovely couple-- the bride and groom, Louise and Eugene! [cheering] [♪♪] Who knew dental hygienists had those kind of moves? Did you see that she caught the bouquet? Doesn't look like she's letting go anytime soon. [♪♪] Aw, look at Louise. She seems so happy. Yeah. I think she found a really good man. I think so, too. You know, I wanted to write to you. Just didn't know where to send the postcards. [♪♪] Come on. [♪♪] [♪♪] I tried writing you, too. Just a very long time ago. Open it. "Trevi Fountain. Colosseum. Sistine Chapel. I don't know where any of these places are, but if you wanna go, I wanna go. But only with you. Love, David." I was 13 years old when I wrote that note. It was right after I read yours. I put it in that book right there, hoping that one day maybe you would find it. But you never did. Not the smartest idea of all time, but... it was okay... because you were happy. You asked me once if I'd ever been in love. The answer is, just once. And I never stopped. For me, it's always been you. I loved you yesterday, I love you today... I'll love you tomorrow. [♪♪] Dance with me. [♪♪] I thought I might get a kiss with that line. Shh! [♪♪] Sorry, hold on. He's going to propose. Just watch. I thought you didn't like these dating shows. Well, you know... Love and stuff. [♪♪]
