(Crowd cheering) Male announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes on the two-ton metal mesh of madness. And here he is, folks. The one, the only, handsome Luke and the heartthrobs.

I gotta go home. Want me to give you a ride? (Sighs) Thanks. You don't wanna talk or anything? You know, I leave town tomorrow after we pack up. I'm not gonna be around for another year. Another year? Yeah, you wanna get a beer or something? I got someone, so no. Just wanted to see you again. Thanks. (Motorcycle engine starting) Male announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the one, the only, handsome Luke and the heartthrobs. (Banging on door) Hey. Is romina here? No. Hold on. She's working. Okay. Do you remember me? Yes, I remember you. Who's that guy? He's yours. You wanna hold him? (Mutters softly) There you go. His name's Jason. Romina: Hey. There you go. Female customer: Thanks. Good? Great. Hey. What are you doing here? Anything you wanna tell me? Anything you think I might wanna know before I leave here forever and I never come back? Let's go outside. Come on. You weren't gonna tell me? It was just a fling, right? That means you don't gotta tell me? Just as, like, a common courtesy or... There might even be a law, you know, you gotta fucking tell somebody. I haven't heard from you in over a year. You just took off. Never called me. I gotta leave in four hours. I don't know what to do. (Tearfully) You do whatever you need to do. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna do what I have to do. I'm going to school. I take care of Jason. I work here. And I have a man. So that's what I'm doing. That's my life. You're busy. Yeah. Yeah, I'm real busy. Well... I don't wanna keep you. Okay. All right. (Motorcycle engine starts) Luke: When does this pay period end, Jack? On Friday? Why? Because I gotta get paid. Just pay me for half the week, all right? I don't give advances out. I'm not asking for an advance, Jack. I'm quitting. You can't quit. I just did. (Women shouting in Spanish) Hey. Hey. Wow. You look like a Princess. (Jason crying) What are you still doing here? I stuck around. This is really not a good time. No? No. I was just gonna take him to the park or maybe see if I could just sit on the porch, just say hi to him. We're on our way to church. Going to church? Romina: Um... This is kofi. We need to go. Romina: Yeah. You should call. You can't just show up, you know? Kofi: You ready? Romina: Yeah. (Romina speaking Spanish) Romina's mother: Okay. Hey. Romina's mother: Hi. Luke: You live here? Yup. This is my house. How long you in town? I'm gonna stick around. What are you looking at? Really, you gonna do this shit today? Do what? (Jason crying) Priest: Is it your will that Jason should be baptized in the faith of the church, which we all have professed with you? Kofi: Yes. By god's gift, through water and the holy spirit, we are reborn into everlasting life. In his goodness, may he continue to pour out his blessings upon these sons and daughters of his. May he make them faithful members of his holy people. Jason, I baptize you in the name of the father, and of the son and of the holy spirit. This child of yours has been enlightened by Christ. He is to walk always as a child of the light. God, the father of our lord, Jesus Christ, has freed you from sin. We now anoint you with the chrism of salvation as Christ was anointed priest, prophet and king. So may you always live as a member of his body, sharing everlasting life. Amen. In the name of this child and the spirit of our common friendship, let us pray together in the words our lord has given us. (All praying) Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Priest: The almighty god, the father, the son and the holy spirit bless you. Amen. Now, as we receive our new member into our parish, let us all welcome him with great joy. (All applauding) (Motorcycle engine revving) (Engine sound fades) (Engine sound resumes) Ride that thing really good! Really good! (Truck engine starting) You ride good, man. Would you like a ride into town? Save you some gas, man. (Turns engine off) Man: Just passing through? Luke: I'm just settling in. Where you staying? Some fucking motel. Yeah. They are no good around here. Whole town's gone to shit, man. So you got a job? No. You know your way around an engine? Yeah. 'Cause I got a shop, repair shop, on washout road. You should come check it out, man. I could always use a good worker. All right. It ain't much. It's what it is, you know, but it's mine. No one can kick me out of it. So, that's the workshop in there. This is tula. I don't get a whole lot of work here, you know? But if you want, you can look for other jobs or whatever, you know. If it's not enough for you. I do everything. Everything there is to do to a car, I know how to do. Anything you don't know, I can teach you, you know? And I got a trailer down here. Stay there if you want. (Whistling) Yeah, see? She's shy. (Chuckles) She can't see so good anymore. Where is it? Where's the ball? There's the trailer. She get it? No, she ain't gonna get it, man. You live out here all alone? Yeah, I live alone. Sometimes people come stay for a while, you know. That's it. It's not much, but, you know, it's got whatever you need in there. It must get lonely. (Thunder rumbles) Luke: Look, Rob, I don't wanna be ungrateful. I really appreciate what you're doing for me and shit, but I gotta make more fucking money. Robin: Hey, man, if I could pay you more, I would. You know, you're good at what you do, man. Really good. Luke: I could fix up that ol' mack truck that's sitting there like a goddamn... Well, that's good. You can go ahead and fix it up, but I don't have the money to pay you. You know, there are other things that could be done, you know. Like what? Well, you could Rob a bank. (Chuckles) You're full of shit. I'm not full of shit. I've done it four times myself. I stopped 12 years ago because it was getting too hot. As long as you don't do it too many times, you're fine. You got a kid, you wanna provide for that kid? You wanna maybe edge out your competition? You gotta do that using your skill set, and your skill set... (Clicks tongue) Very unique. What do you say? Go fuck yourself. Okay. Well, good luck supporting your family on minimum wage. (Motorcycle engine roaring) Luke: He's my son and I should be around him. I wasn't around my dad, look at the fucking way I turned out. Look, I wanna take care of you. I wanna take care of my son. That's my job. Let me do my job. How are you gonna take care of us? Don't say it like that. But how are you gonna take care of me? Don't... (Sighs) Don't talk down to me. It's a question. I'm not talking down to you. It's just a question. I will find a way to do it. You want a house, I'll get you a house. You wanna get the fuck out of here, we'll get out of here. I got that trailer. I'll get a truck, we'll hit the road. You pick a place you like, we'll stop. You don't wanna be there? "Fuck you," we're outta there. What about my mom? She can come. And what about kofi? He can stay. He can get his own girl and his own kid. That's every man's right. That sounds like a nice dream. Ro... (Sighs) (Motorcycle engine running) (Car horn honks) Robin: You can, uh, use this. If you wanna. But keep in mind, man, I did four banks with a note. In other words, you don't need the gun. I never liked guns, man. They're vulgar, you know. But you may wanna take it. I don't know. Whatever you wanna do. How do we do it? Okay. First thing is, we're gonna go in there nice and early. Just when the doors open, okay? You're gonna take a look at all the tellers. (Chuckles) Go for the oldest woman you can, right? Failing that, go to the most meek. You get her to put the money out on the table. Why? So, that way, you can see if there's a dye pack. You put it in your pocket. You don't hand anything over to them. You don't show them the gun. And you go. Get on your bike. I'll be about four blocks away. Ride it into the truck. Bam, we're home, we're done, we're rich. (Taps on bonnet) Luke: What happens if you get stopped sitting by the side of the road with an open cube truck? What are you gonna say? What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm an officer. "Excuse me, sir, what are you doing with an open cube truck? "What are you doing? Why are you sitting here like this?" Oh, I'm broken down. I'm waiting for the, you know, repairs. Thank you for asking, officer. That's a nice touch. Right? What are you gonna do if you get jock itch and, you know, you're riding 90 miles an hour down the street? You're gonna keep riding, right? Yeah? I mean, we do what we do. But when we do it together... Shazam. I'm just sayin'. Not since hall and oates has there been such a team. (Robin chuckles) Which one are you? Oh, I know. So I gotta be the dark, curly-haired guy? You gotta be the good-looking one? I guess that's about right. Robin: This is gonna be good, man. You're gonna like doing this. It's the biggest rush of your life. (Cocks gun) (Rock song playing) (Engine revs) Woman: Oh! All right! Everybody who wants to live, put your hands in the fucking air! Get over here! Get over here now! Get the fuck over here! Get on your knees! All right. What's your name? Max. Max is my little fucking dog. Everybody get your fucking money and he's gonna go fetch. Get it out and put it on the table right now! Get it out! Pray! Pray! Let me hear you fucking pray! Got that money out, boy? Go fucking fetch. Fast! (People murmuring) Get it out. Put it in that bag. (Engine revving) (Tires screeching) (Police siren wailing) (Sirens approach) They're not turning! How much d'you get? Oh, baby. Oh! Beautiful fucking baby boy! Are you okay, man? You good? (Groans) You did it, man! You did it! (Retches) Yes! (Chuckles) God damn it, we fucking did it! We fucking did it! (Rock song playing) (Laughing) Yeah! Luke: Tell me about him. What's he like to eat? He, like, really likes apples. (Chuckles) But I have to kind of chew it up for him. You chew up his apples? (Laughs) Yeah. It sounds gross, but it's not when I'm doing it. (Chuckles) Has he ever had ice cream? Not yet. You're fucking kidding me. He's still a baby. Bullshit. What kind of house are you running? No ice cream? (Laughing) Why can't he have that? It's not like he can't have it, he just hasn't had it. Can I give it to him? You wanna give him ice cream? Yeah. I wanna do something with him that's his first time. I wanna look in his face when he tries ice cream. Every time he has ice cream for the rest of his life, he's gonna see my fucking face. (Romina laughing) Yeah. (Both laughing) Okay, come on. Come on. No, he's funny. Come on. Wanna hear it on? (Engine starts) (Revving) (Crying) Oh! I'm sorry. (Chuckles) Here. It's okay. He cries a lot. I'm sorry. Oh, so you want the bike in it, too? Yeah, just all... You know, so that... Just capture the mood. It's a nice bike. The bike's part of the family. (Camera clicks) Girl: You want another one? You sure I should take it when she's crying? Okay. (Romina chuckles tearfully) That's a good trick. (Sniffles) Shh! Man: Five, six, seven... Put that fucking money on the counter. Give me the real stuff. Don't give me the fucking fake stuff. I know what it is. Man: Ten, 11, 12. Let me see you... Come here. Come here. (Tires screech) (Engine roars) Hola, mami. Romina's mother: Hola. (Luke singing in Spanish) What is this? (Continues singing) What is... (Continues singing) What is this? It's presents. Oh, my god. What is that? It's a crib. (Jason gurgling) Easy, easy, easy. Hey, boss, you gotta stay... You're gonna fall off this bed. (Blowing raspberries) There you go. (Car doors opening) Your mom's home. (Car doors closing) Romina: Hi, mami. Think she's gonna be mad? (Women speaking Spanish) Hey. Hey. What are you doing? I got him a crib and some toys. (Jason crying) You know, this is really nice and all, but you gotta get this outta here. You can't just show up like this. Luke: Why? Romina: 'Cause this is kofi's fucking house. What? Just get it out, please. He can't be sleeping in a bed. He's gonna roll out and bust his head open. He needs a crib. What's going on? (Jason crying loudly) You okay with this? (Shushing) I'm talking to you. You okay with this? Kofi, it's his father. In our house? You okay with him in our house? (Jason continues crying) (Romina continues shushing) What are you doing here, man? Shh-shh. You're making him cry. Don't shush me. You in my house, man. You need to pack all this shit up and get out the house, man. I don't know who you think you are, just coming up in our life and changing shit around, but this ain't gonna work. Luke: You gotta lower your voice, man. Excuse me? Lower your voice. Romina, can you step outside, please? Pack all this shit up and take it out, man. You're making the baby cry. You're making the baby cry. Pick this shit up and get it out the house now, man. I'm not fucking with you. (Luke shushes) (Jason continues crying) Pick up all this shit, man. Fuck you, man.

Sausage and pepper. Thanks for coming out. From sabatiello's. Oh, how are you? Bill killcullen, da. Avery cross. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Oh, of course. I know who you are. I know your father, you know. Long time now. I apologize. No, not at all. He's a great guy. I wouldn't have expected anything less from his son, but this was above and beyond. I just did what anybody would do, right? Weirzbowski: That's right. And better. I don't know about that... The whole force is pulling for you, man. Don't you forget that. They're all outside. Banners, everything. What happened to that guy? That guy's gone. He's dead. It's over. That's the way it happens. Right? Avery: Yeah, but did he leave anybody behind? That's not... It's not for you to worry about right now. We got people who are gonna talk to you about that. There's people talking to his family. Got rid of another bad guy. And you're a hero. All right-y? Yeah. Bill wants to ask you a few questions. Is that all right? It's just your first impressions, that kind of thing. Just what... Weirzbowski: Formality, you know? Yeah, it's pretty simple. Yeah. Sure. All right, I'll leave you two to get to know each other. Oh. All right. So what happened when you were just outside the door? Um, I said, "police, drop your weapon." Um, "face down on the ground with your hands spread." And, uh, nothing. Nothing, right. Nothing. Did you announce yourself again, or not? No. No, that's all we need to do is make ourselves known, right? Yeah, but it's sometimes not easy to tell whether they've heard you making yourself known. You know what I mean? Anyway, you were yelling. Is that right? I was making myself known as we were trained, correct. Okay. All right. Okay. Then what? At that point, I knew that I had to make entry, and I kicked the door down. Was the... Was the door locked? Correct. And you knew that because... What do you mean? You just assumed that the door was locked? How did I know it was locked? Yeah. Is that a trick question? No. No. I'm just wondering why you didn't turn the thing. That's how I knew it was locked. Did you tell me that? No. Okay. All right, so you kick it in. Right. Why are you... Why'd you come down here? I'm sorry, why did I come down here? Yeah. Why wasn't somebody else... A slow day at the office or... No. What happened after that? What would you like me to tell you? I just need you to tell me what happened. You do? I don't want you to misremember so, tomorrow, you're trying to match what you half-thought today. I only want you to tell me what you saw and what you remember. I shot the perpetrator, he fell out the window. I know that. When did he pull his gun? Did you shoot him first, or did he shoot first? Don't fuck with me. Do the right thing, tell me what the fuck happened. It was pretty quick. Who shot first? His hand comes up, you fire? His hand comes up, he fires, you fire? Right. Like that? Yeah. Like pop-pop. That sounds like he shot first. Yeah. Female reporter: Well, it's just a triumphant day for officer Avery cross. He left Ellis hospital well enough to go home and happy to be alive, with supporters from his schenectady pd family cheering him on. His father, state supreme court judge al cross, says he's very happy his son is alive today. There's the life of a cop, the life my son chose. Reporter: Twenty-nine-year-old cross hadn't even been on the force for a full year before he ran head-on into the alleged moto bandit. Pursuing Luke glanton through the streets of schenectady after a bank robbery, glanton ran into a home, then he came face-to-face with officer cross. You okay? Glanton fired at cross, hitting him in the knee. Cross fired back, killing glanton and saving the hostages. Glanton was a drifter and, at times, a motorcycle stunt rider, and police say he had a very violent past. Officer: The guy had a long track record, you know? He was a professional criminal. Reporter: He moved here last spring, and he hadn't even been here for a full month before he started robbing banks here. He leaves behind an infant son. Male newsreader: Coming up, Dallas and Denver... Jennifer: Was it scary, honey? Avery: Happened so fast. I don't think there was time to be scared. Scary for me. I just don't understand why you're doing this. Nobody does. Doing what? What am I doing? I was speaking with your father and we... (Sighs) We both agree... Of course he does. I'm sorry. I just thought that... I'm a cop, Jen. I'm a cop. That's it. There's no... I just thought maybe after this, maybe you would've had enough. Hey, there's no more to discuss. That's all. I just thought maybe you would've had enough. That's it. Okay? Baby, you can't expect me not to think that. You guys just don't get it. You guys just don't get it. I'm sorry. We're just worried. We're just worried about you. Stop saying that. That's all. Stop fucking saying that. Therapist: Have you been replaying the incident in your mind? Not really. Mmm-hmm. No, I'm trying to put it out of my mind, I think. Does that work? Yeah. You think you're ready to go back to duty? Yes. Would you want yourself as a partner? Absolutely. What have you been thinking about since the shooting? Not much, um... (Chuckles) (Stammers) Everything's been so crazy, you know, with the rehabilitation and work and everything at home. Mmm-hmm. Everything at home? What's happening at home? (Clears throat) Well, I'm there now, which is much different. Who's at home with you? Um... Well, uh, my mother-in-law, uh, my wife and my boy. So there's, um... You know, it's been hard on my wife. It's a shock. And then, um, it doesn't help that there's a... You know, a baby around. But it's okay. I mean, it's okay. What do you mean, "it doesn't help that there's a baby around?" Well, I just mean, with everything that's... That's going on... Just trying to... To get all this in order, uh... Before I can take care of that. It's been... (Stammers) I've just been so busy that it's been hard to, uh... (Sighs) I have a... I have a hard time Looking at my son. Mmm-hmm. And that's something new, since the shooting? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. You know, I saw in the police record that this perp also had a 1-year-old son. His name is Jason. Have you been thinking about this? This? You mean... The fact that he had a boy? Yeah. Do you think you're having a hard time looking at your son because you're thinking about this other little boy that won't have his father? (Crowd cheering on TV) (Announcer chattering on TV) (Baby gurgling) (Doorbell ringing) You expecting someone? No. You? Scott: Hey! Hi. (Laughing) Hi. How you doing? Hey. Hey, how's the gimp doing?

That's my wife, Jennifer. Hey, how are you? Nice to meet you. Hi. You guys hungry? No, we're... We'll just leave you to it. No, come on in, have some dinner. No, we didn't come here for dinner. We got plenty of food. Come on in. Well, I... (Chuckles) There you go. Oh, yeah. Glad we decided to do this. Avery: Oh, good. I'm glad you guys came. Here you go. Thanks. So how's it feel to have the hero home? Probably can't wait for him to get back to work, huh? (Laughs) No, it's great having him home. I just thank god he's okay, you know? DeLuca: God bless that. I think we should toast on that. To our hero. Doc: To hero boy. Scott: Hero boy. Doc: There you go. DeLuca: Glad you're okay. I've been on the force for 22 years, pulled a trigger maybe three, four times. You're on for six months, you already got one in the bag. And he was white. (All laughing) That's an extra 50. (Doc chuckles) Avery: Oh, better him than me, right? DeLuca: Hey, you got that right. Officers: Absolutely. You guys have any plans for tonight? Avery: Um... No, we're just... This is it. Yeah? This is the big plan, having you guys here for dinner. Aw! Would you mind if we stole the hero for a little police work after this? Uh... Tonight? And we'll have him back by curfew. (Stammers) I don't know, honey, you should probably rest tonight. Maybe tomorrow night. DeLuca: Yeah, we kind of need him tonight. Is there a problem? What about your leg, or... DeLuca: Well, we're not gonna be running. We'll carry him. (Officers laughing) What are you gonna do? DeLuca: We just wanna introduce him to a bunch of people who really admire him for what he did. They just wanna congratulate him in person. Good, yeah, that sounds good. DeLuca: Leave in about 20 minutes? Not that we wanna eat and run, but we are on duty. Jennifer: No, you should go. That's a great idea. I'm sure everybody would love to meet you. DeLuca: Yeah, there you have it. You're a hero. (Chuckles) DeLuca: I hear a little sarcasm in your voice. Me? Yeah. He is a hero. Yeah. He's a hero around here, that's for sure. You don't mind if we take him then, do you? Not at all. I think it's a great idea. Yeah, all right, there you have it. You're released. Release the hounds! Yeah. Hey, Avery, does she sometimes, like, tuck her balls up, at least at night? (DeLuca laughing) Hey, Pete? Pete? What? Can you pop the trunk? DeLuca: Sure it's okay with her? Scott, you know I'm not on active duty, right? Yeah, we're aware. It's a little gift we got going for you. (Engine starts) DeLuca: Let's go! (Tires screech) (Knocking on door) Police. Yes? Hi. Romina Gutierrez, please. Doc: That's the woman, right there. Romina. Yeah. Hi. Hi, I'm officer DeLuca. Romina Gutierrez? Yeah. Yeah, we're here to search your house. What for? For evidence. Evidence for what? We're looking for the money that Luke glanton may or may not have given to you. Yeah, well, we don't have anything that... (Stammers) You can't just walk in here. Yeah, I can. No, you can't. Why's that? 'Cause it's my house. Look, you assume that I have a warrant, and I'll assume that your mother has papers, okay? This won't take long. Come on. Romina: Kofi. We're just gonna start upstairs, okay? Romina: No, no, no, no. No, no, my baby's upstairs. My baby's upstairs sleeping. Your baby's... Yeah, my baby's upstairs sleeping, so, no, we're not gonna start up there. No, no, no, don't go up there. Romina, hey, relax, relax, relax. He can't go up there. DeLuca: Yeah, he can. You can go up there if you want. But if we find evidence while you're up there, you're under arrest. For what? We've done this a lot of times, okay? It'll be quiet. Go on, Scotty. Be quiet. (Whispers) How about a cup of coffee? Yes, yes, yes. That'd be great. Is it all right if I go into your living room here? Yeah, go ahead. Thanks. I'm sorry for your loss. Romina, let's go. Come on. (Indistinct chattering) (Panting) (Hushed) What are we doing? What are we doing here? Hey, this is crazy. Wait outside. I don't want... No, we gotta go. This is fucked-up. Why the fuck are we here? Let go of my arm, man. What the fuck are we doing here? Let go of my arm. Scott, what the fuck are we doing here? Shut up. DeLuca: How long did you know Luke? Romina: A couple years. Did you know he was robbing banks? No. You didn't know that at all? No. Let me just ask you one more time, because this is what we do. You have no knowledge to this money? No. Officer, I swear to god. It's not here? No. It's not outside? Scott: If I was gonna hide something, I would hide it closest to my heart. Avery: (Whispering) Scott. Scott: Pick him up. Pick up the baby. I don't think we should do this. I don't wanna wake him. I don't wanna pick him up. Pick him up. I'm good. Put him back and let's go. (Indistinct chattering) What's up? Yeah, they're clean. All right-y. We'll get out of your hair. DeLuca: What do you got there, Scotty? Come on. Help him out, will you? Doc: Scotty, stop. Stop. You gotta give me a chance to count it. You gonna count like that, we're gonna be here till 5:00 in the morning. How are you gonna count it? Got a money counter in your asshole? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fourteen grand. $14,000. Well, it's not gonna be an even split because the lion's share's going to our hero. Consider it unofficial hazard pay. Doc: From us to you. (All laughing) Enjoy it. DeLuca: 'Cause you're not gonna get it from the department. Doc: Don't spend it all in one place. (Chuckles) Fucking earned that. Don't forget that. DeLuca: Not bad, huh? Doc: Not bad for a night's work. (Laughing) (Sighs) Weirzbowski: We're gathered here to celebrate a cop who makes other cops proud. We can all rest a little easier at night now that he's on the path to recovery. Ladies and gentlemen, officer Avery cross. (All applauding) Thank you. Thank you, chief. Thank you for your support. (Crying) When I was in law school, we used to always talk about justice. We'd have discussions about justice. That's just what they were... Discussions. I joined the police force because I wanted to work alongside the brave men and women who know that some problems can't be solved by talking. Now, no one wants to be in the situation I found myself in a couple weeks ago. I certainly wish that it turned out differently. I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes I even wish that (sighs) Maybe it wasn't me that was called upon that house that day. But that's the job. And I can't think of another line of work that I'd rather be in. Thank you. (All applauding) How's it feel? (Groans) (Exhales) I'm not sure it's doing much good. How's the spotlight? I'm ready for it to end. (Laughs) Look, don't worry, it will. You know, the police always put on a big show when something like this happens 'cause the hero card's the only one they have to play. I'm not really thinking about that, dad. I'm just trying to get back to work. You know, Avery, if you planned this, it couldn't have turned out any better. But you're not gonna make it work for you in the police department. I promise you that. I didn't come here to be lectured, dad. You tricked me. You said the pool would be good for my knee. Sorry. You know, I'm not as calculated as you. You know, my life's not a campaign. It's much simpler. Yeah. Well, for somebody not campaigning, you gave a hell of a speech yesterday. You certainly had my vote. Plus, that knee's a goldmine. (Sighs) No, I mean, a limp goes a long way in politics. (Laughs) Look at Roosevelt. (Overlapping chatter) Pull out the red carpet! Get the flowers out! Get all the flowers out! Here she comes. Come here. (Laughing) I gotta go see the chief. I gotta go see the chief. Why? I don't know. I don't know. Is it bad news? Think it'll be bad news? Scott: Say hi to the chief for me. Gonna be goin' back down up there. (Laughs) Oh, Jesus Christ. (Scott) Stay off your knee. Don't mess your hair up, pretty boy. Weirzbowski: Got a call today from da killcullen. (Sighs) Weirzbowski: Close the door. The state internal investigation into the shooting of Luke glanton has been deemed lawful. Congratulations, officer. You can put it behind you, get back to police work. The question is, can you go back out on patrol anytime soon, and if you could, can you be effective? I don't think that I can. That's okay. You know what? There's a lot of jobs to be done around here that, in ways, and you know that, in ways, are much more important than what happens out on the street. I'm so glad you said that because, chief, I've thought a lot about this and I think that I could be best utilized as a lieutenant in charge of special investigations. There's a lot of restructuring within the division that I've actually formulated... I can't fucking do that. Well, yeah, of course you could. I mean... Cross! Come on. You paid too much for your education to act so stupid, kid. Well, I think it's the very fact that I do have an education like this that perhaps is the reason why I've thought about how restructuring the unit, the division, can actually benefit you, me... Cross, I appreciate your ambition, I really do. And I think... You know, I think you're gonna be a great cop. You are a great cop. You're a hero. But at this point, right now, you gotta get back to real life, and in real life, you got two choices. Which are? You can retire on disability... I don't wanna do that. All right, good. I don't want you to do that either. Or you could be reassigned at your current rank. That's it. You gotta work your way up, man. (Person whistling tune) Hey, man, heard you were down here. Hey. What are you doing? What are you doing in plain clothes? You didn't hear? I made vice. (Laughs) Get the fuck outta here. Yeah, man, I'm actually paired up with DeLuca. That's good. What do you got for me? Oh, yeah, couple mutts left this in the back seat of their car. A leaky substance. All right. So when are we gonna get together, grab a little bite, you know, talk about some things? Sounds great. All right, man. Page me. Okay. Thanks. Scott: What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive. The only reason why I'm asking is 'cause you're my friend. I don't know what I can do to help, but, yeah, what do you need? All right. Right on. DeLuca and I have been working on this case, all right? And I want you to keep this to yourself. It's a little private. And I don't want anybody to know about it, okay? Okay. Okay, DeLuca and I are working with this fucking hooker. We gotta fucking head her off with some coke. So DeLuca and I thought that, you know, if... We need some temporary access to the evidence room. We need you to get some shit. We gotta hit this bitch off. That's what we need. I really tried to look out for you with that seven grand. Now I need you to look out for me. I'm serious, bro. This is how it works. (Sighs) (Keys jangling) Hey. Hey, don't worry, it's okay. I didn't mean to startle you. It's okay. I just wanna give you something. All right? Listen, this is the money that we recovered from your house, okay? I want you to have it. I don't know what that is. You don't have to ever even see me again, just take the money. (Sobbing) I'm not here as a police officer, I'm here as a regular guy. Listen, listen, listen. Listen to me. Get the fuck away. You fucked up my son's life, therefore you fucked up my life! Get the fuck away from me. Avery: I should have brought this to you sooner, and I apologize. This was recovered from a house during a search. No, wait a minute, cross. It's just a small fraction of what's going on. Wait a minute, cross. Don't say another word. What do you mean? No, no, no, don't say another word. What do you expect me to do with this? You're joking, right? This is shit. Chief. This ain't my problem, all right? This is your problem. This is our problem of the fucking police department, and I'm bringing it to your attention because that's what I should fucking do! Oh, yeah, is that right? Yeah! Is that what you should do? Rat out other fucking cops? Chief... This is un-fucking-believable, all right? Get this shit out of here! (Panting) (Police siren wailing) Fuck. Hey. DeLuca: Where you going? I was going home. You know that thing you and Scotty been talking about? Yeah. Sure. Well, you and I have to talk about it. Follow me. (Breathing heavily) (Engine starting) (Sighs) (Avery breathes heavily) What the fuck? Fucking... (Cocking) (Continues breathing heavily) Oh, fuck. (Tires screeching) DeLuca: Hey! (Grunts) (Coughing) Hey, pop. Avery. There's a way out of this. You're not gonna like it. You wanna hear? Yeah, I wanna hear it. Let's start with the precinct. Anybody there still trust you? Scott. We'll start with Scott. (Kids shouting) Scott: Playing shortstop. Avery: Looks good. He's getting bigger. Jesus Christ. (Sighs) You really gave DeLuca quite a scare. He's ready to dump you, the whole thing. Enough with these fucking tests, all right? Either ask me to help you or just leave me the fuck alone. (Crowd applauding) (Avery claps) I need you to go into the locker, I need you to take the mckillen case out. It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "mckillen" across it, okay? I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag. I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning. If somebody asks you, "hey, why is this lighter?" You say, "hey, you know what? "I'm a rookie. I made a mistake." You're a squeaky-clean fucking lawyer with a medal of honor. Nobody's gonna question you, okay? You gotta do this for me. I'm in a jam with these guys. No problem. I knew I could count on you, man. Yeah. Tell Mike I love him. I gotta go. All right. (Tape rewinding) Scott: (On tape) I need you to go into the locker, I need you to take the mckillen case out. It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "mckillen" across it, okay? I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag. I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning. All right? Lf somebody asks you, "hey, why is this lighter?" You say, "hey, you know what? "I'm a rookie. I made a mistake." You're a squeaky-clean fucking lawyer with a medal of honor. Nobody's gonna question you, okay? You gotta do this for me. I'm in a jam with these guys. Avery: (On tape) No problem. (Turns recorder off) You shown this to ia? 'Course not. Handing it to you on a silver platter. Got any idea what this means? Are you ready to do it? Are you, son? Are you really ready? 'Cause they're gonna fuckin' tear you in half. I'm gonna need your assurance you're gonna follow through with it. Really? And I'm gonna want full immunity when you do. You can't just walk in here and tell me what the fuck to do. You understand? And when you do, I wanna be made assistant district attorney. I have a law degree and I passed the bar. I don't have a spot for you right now. Make a spot. I won't do that. I can't just snap my fingers and make you assistant da. You can say no. You can say no, I'll walk out this door, I'll walk over to the gazette, I'll tell 'em everything I know, including this conversation. Listen, you're not going anywhere. Don't... Listen. Put it back on the table, I'll fucking do it. All three things? All right. I'm not gonna promise you how long you're gonna stay there. You're not gonna shake my fucking hand, pal. I'll make you assistant da. I'm never gonna shake your fucking hand. You're too smart for your own good. Female reporter: Come down, come here. Get right in there for a good shot. Detective, how do you respond to these allegations? (Cameras clicking) (Prisoners yelling) Reporter: Drugs, corruption and gangs. It's not an investigation by the schenectady police department, it's an investigation into the schenectady police department. Earlier today, da William killcullen announced that his office, along with the fbl, would be handing down indictments that would lead to the arrest of these schenectady police officers. The da is making allegations today that the vice officers were acting like the gangs that they were supposed to be busting. Officers allegedly stole drugs and money, even guns from inside the evidence room here. Officials say that, with that stolen evidence, the cops paid criminals to help set up their rivals, which then led to those headline-grabbing arrests. The da announced its star witness in the case today, hero cop Avery cross, who, less than a year ago, was shot in the line of duty while trying to save two schenectady residents from the alleged moto bandit. In schenectady, I'm Jessica Layton, news channel 13. It's gonna be all right. Male newsreader: Thanks, Jess. It's the largest case of fraud this region has seen... (Turns off TV) Avery: You know, when I was a kid, I used to look at my dad dressed in judge's robes and I used to think that my father was a superhero. And I don't think I was far off. He had that quality that judges have where they have tremendous compassion, but they're also ferocious at the same time. He wasn't afraid of making enemies. I think that's probably why he had so many friends. I had the chance, right before he fell into the coma, to tell him that I was dedicating my run for Attorney General to him. And... (Chuckles) He shook his head, "no," and I didn't understand why. So I leaned in close, and... He could whisper. And he said to me, "I'll take the win, not the run." (Faint laughter) That was my dad, that was al. Son, you wanna come with me? Sure. Jennifer: Avery? Yeah. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Close the door. What's wrong? Jennifer: We have to talk about aj. He wants to come and live with you. He won't stop asking me about it. Really? (Sighs) I guess that's a good idea at some point. I think he needs you. I think, if he doesn't come and live with you, he's gonna completely go off the rails. It's just right now, you know, with the campaign and everything, it's just not an ideal time. I mean, what am I gonna do with him? I don't know what he likes. I just don't think it would be good for him or anybody. I mean, come on, you know that. Okay. No, well, you can tell him that. Jennifer... What am I supposed to tell him? I just don't... Why are you doing this right now? You can tell him now. Man 1: Tomorrow we're gonna head to buffalo in the morning. Wednesday is outer boroughs in New York City, and then the al Smith dinner at night. Do we have time to get there? We do, absolutely. We'll have our last event close in queens, we'll hit the upper West Side and then we have to be at the Waldorf. How about Yusef, the driver we had for my dad? Can we get Yusef? Yeah, totally. What's going on in queens? In queens, he's gonna do an event on environmental issues. Yeah. Talking about some of the... Protecting the sound, and some of the environmental stuff. And then Thursday head to Rochester for lunch. You're gonna go to a place where you're gonna order something called the garbage plate. Just want you to be prepared for it. That's the picture. We're gonna do that... Did you see? Man 2: Yeah, no, I've seen it. Man 1: And then Sunday morning, black churches. Avery: Oh, perfect. Woman: Avery cross? Aj: Yeah. Aj. Aj? Hi, aj. Yeah. So what high school are you coming from? Troy high school. Yeah. You're coming from Troy? Okay. So not too far away. What brings you to schenectady? Uh, my dad wanted me here. Your dad wanted you here? Yeah, for my senior year, he wanted me to move here. What about you? Did you wanna come here for your senior year? I don't know. Yeah. I... I guess not, not really. (Laughs) Do you know anybody here? At the high school? No. No. Don't know anybody? Aj: Just... Just peek over your shoulder. Peek over your fucking shoulder. There. Hello. Hello. Hello. You don't like them girls? I don't know, maybe you're just used to it. They ain't got girls like that where I come from. You feel me? Where are you from? Troy. Troy? Yeah, you heard of Troy? Yeah, I've heard of Troy. Where's Troy at? It's fucking right next door, dude. Right next door? I would've guessed you were from long island. Where's that? It's where people that talk like you come from. (Laughs) B, I'm bored as a motherfucker around here, dude. I've been here for, like, fucking three days, I'm bored out of my fucking mind. Welcome to schenectady. What do you dudes do for fun, nothing? This is it? This is what I got, for a year? No, we got some things. What? Don't say, like, a mall. If you say a fucking mall, b, like, I swear to god... (Chuckles) What do you do? I get high. We do some of that around here. I could tell you smoked. I seen you from back there. You one of them loner... Loner-stoners is what I call 'em, right? You like to get high and, like, chill in your room and draw and shit. So what you trying to do with the rest of this day, then? You trying to go to math class? You wanna go get high? Let's go. All right, let's go. Aj: You know what this remind me of? The goonies. You know that movie? Where they're, like, all in a cave? You want a cigarette, just ask, don't worry. I'll take a cigarette. I like smoking cigarettes when I'm high. You like smoking when you're smoking? (Both laughing) You smoke menthols, man? Like a breath of fresh air. (Rapping) Like a breath of fresh air. But you don't care. You got the smoke puff blowing everywhere, I swear. Yo, here we go, I said my spit is my mo. My mouth is my gun, I shoot up your whole squadron with one flip of my tongue. And you done. When did you write that? No, I'm not trying to lie. I wrote that. Aj: Fucking quiet around here. Jason: Shit, though, when I was a kid, there were always kids playing here, you know? Aj: Oh, you came here when you was a kid? Jason: Yeah, man, I'd come here with my parents sometimes. Aj: Are your parents still together? Jason: Yeah. That's cool, they're still together. Yeah, it's all right. It's not my real dad, though. Where's your real dad at? Oh, he died, actually, like in a car accident or something. Shit. Yeah, this is kind bud, dude. But you know where I could score some x? Yeah. For tonight? Well, we just did our downer, we gotta get up. Remember, come back by yourself. All right? Yeah, man, you got it. All right. Let's go. Let me see it. What? Let me see the fucking drugs. You fucking crazy, man? Let me see my fucking drugs. (Laughs) Fucking nuts, man. What the fuck? I gave you $500. Yeah, that's 20 hits. Yo, that's inflation in scheneck, right? (Laughs) Oh, yo, what the fuck, son? Dead ass, the fucking 5-0. Don't worry about it, man. Oh, fuck! Fuck! Police. Let me see your hands. Police! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! All right! Fuck! Interlace your fingers. (Groans) Weirzbowski: He was buying ecstasy from a schenectady kid. Campaign advisor: And who arrested him? Weirzbowski: A couple of beat cops. Mccracken and Potter. You know these guys? Mmm-hmm. They'll sit on it if I ask them to. Campaign advisor: Did anybody else see him come in? Weirzbowski: No. I made sure of that. (Sighs) Campaign advisor: Did you get any sense that he knew this kid or... Weirzbowski: Yeah, friends. Campaign advisor: Just the two of 'em? Weirzbowski: Yeah. Okay. What's this other kid's name? Jason kancam. Got busted a few years ago for shoplifting. What's his name? Weirzbowski: Jason kancam. An aimless youth. Gordon, can we kill the mic on room 3? Yeah. (Door closes) Dad, I fucked up. I know... And I know you don't have time to deal with this stuff right now. Not him, okay? What? I want you to leave him alone. All right? Okay? Why? Wipe that fucking smirk off your face! You hear me? I want you to leave that fucking kid alone, all right? Look at me. Look at me. You wanted to come live with me, right? You think this is easy for me, during this time, huh? I'm trying to make this work. I'm doing it for you. You can have anything you want, but I don't want you to touch that kid. You leave him alone. Do you under-fucking-stand me? Say yes. Yes. Look at me and say yes. Yes. Judge: Can you state your name for the record? Jason kancam. Jason, how old are you? Seventeen. Are your parents here today? Yes. Yes. Judge: Can you come up, please? You're Jason's parents? Yes. Jason, you've been charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Counselor, do you waive a formal reading of the charges? Lawyer: Yes, please, your honor. In regards to my client's status, there has been a discussion with the district attorney. Your honor, I may be able to have this case potentially resolved today. So I'd ask that the court put it on for second call. Judge: Second call. Lawyer: This is a c felony, so Jason could do anywhere between five and 15 years. But I'm getting the impression from the prosecutor that they may be willing to reduce it today to a misdemeanor. The offer on his particular case would be time served, which is the day he spent in jail, and a fine, and that would be it. Can he come home with us today? He can. Guess it's your lucky day. Somebody's looking out for you. (Boys laughing) (Overlapping chatter) Look, I didn't mean to get you busted the other night, all right? I'm sorry. Yeah, it was a pretty shitty fucking night. But don't worry about it. I was out of there in five fucking minutes, dude. You think I'm gonna sit there and get fucked up the ass all night? And what happened when you got home? Huh? Went upstairs. Tried to go to sleep, but I was still trippin' like a mo'fucker. Why, what happened to you when you got home? I'm cool, man. Your moms was all worried and shit? Oh, man, my mom's... I'm cool, man. Really? 'Cause I saw that guy today. What guy? Your dad. That's your fucking dad. When did he move in? What the fuck you talking about, aj? Just wanna know. I figured out... What the fuck's your problem? What the fuck's your problem? Chill, dude. Chill. What's your problem, aj? Just fucking around. Don't be so serious. You got a fucking temper, b. You need to watch that shit. It's gonna get you into fucking trouble. Kofi: How was school, Vanessa? It was okay. I had trouble with math. Hey, what's the deal with my dad? What? (Scoffs) What, did you like really hate him or something? What was his name? I'm not doing this. What was his first name? I'm not doing this. Jason: How come mom never talks to me about my dad? (Kofi mimics Darth Vader) I'm your father. Search your feelings. You know it to be true. (Laughs) It's her business to talk about it, not talk about it, you know? Grandma used to tell me some. Yeah? What did she used to say? She said, like... Just that he was, like, an outlaw. You know? Sound cool to you? I don't know. He's not your father. Not really. Just some guy with a baby. I'm your father. Been there since you were born. I will always love you. Can you at least tell me his name? (Knocks) Hello? (Door opening) Yeah? I'm looking for Robin. Yeah, I'm Robin. What can I do for you? Um... I was hoping to talk with you about Luke glanton. I'm his son. You're Luke glanton's son? Yeah. Well, come on back, get a beer. Bet it's down here in this box, if I remember rightly. God. That guy's your dad. That's him there. And that's the pig there, the one that bagged him. Jason: What happened to him? Robin: Who, the cop? Oh, forget about him, man. Don't... Don't start there. I'll show you good things. I'll show you good things. Come on. You are standing right where your dad used to stand and we used to talk. He was a good guy, your dad. Oh, wow. Yeah, those glasses. I haven't seen those in a long time. They're his, those goofy glasses. These were his? Yeah. You can keep those. He would've wanted you to have them. Was he good at anything? Yeah, he was the best motorcycle rider I've ever seen in my life. The best. Yeah? Best. Never seen another one like him. Best. He was like nothing. Rare. Were you guys good friends? Yeah, I think we were. You still got his bike? No, his bike's gone. Yeah. Police took it. I think they cut it up, you know. They were angry with him. I know that. They were real mad with him.

Female newsreader: It was a tight race for over a year between cross and Kellerman, and then unprecedented events over the last month made to threaten cross' election bid. First, allegations of underage drinking at his house, and then a violent robbery from a yet-unidentified intruder that left his son hospitalized with a concussion. Remarkably, cross has managed to right his campaign, and now, as you see, the district attorney has just won the election for Attorney General. We will go live now as senator mcfarley prepares to address the crowd of supporters. (All cheering) I've had the honor of knowing Avery cross since he was a boy. (Speech continues indistinctly) Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure and my greatest honor to introduce the next Attorney General of the state of New York, Avery cross! Go. Curtain. All right, aj, you gotta go. You gotta go out there. There's a flag. Go. Go where the kid is. Go. (All applauding) (Crowd cheering) Thank you! Thank you. Thank you so much. (All chanting) Avery! Avery! Avery! (Knocking on door) Man: Yeah? Mr. Anthony? Yeah. Hey, I, uh... I called you, said I was gonna be out here today. Oh, right, of course. Yeah. Well, you're early. Yeah. There's only, like, one bus headed out here. So... You're not from around here, huh? No. I'm headed out west. So you ready? Wanna go take a look at it? Yeah. I'll just get my coat. All right. All right. It runs great. It's got a lot of miles on it, but I kept up with the maintenance. How much you want for it? Well, I was thinking I need five. All right. You ever ridden one of these before? (Engine starting) (Slow song playing)
