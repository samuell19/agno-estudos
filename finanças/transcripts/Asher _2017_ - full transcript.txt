Are you interested in a chia pudding sample? - We just opened up. - A what? A chia bar. - Chia seed? - Chia? Yeah, it's a paleo and vegan-friendly superfood. More calcium than milk, more omega-3 than salmon! Uh-huh. Yeah, if you present that flyer, you'll get 50 percent off your first offer. Thank you! Your mother don't want pleats? I'm giving you pleats. What can she do? This doesn't mean I want you to disobey your mother. Only I can do that. And you know why? Because I paid my dues. Good. Go change and bring me the pants. Ash! Come. I got something for you. For the uptown thing. When's the out-of-state job coming in? Avi went a different way. A different way? What's it matter? He didn't go your way. He went with Uziel, didn't he? - What, you don't like Uziel? - I mean... Of course, I like Uziel, I taught him every goddamn thing he knows. Well, maybe you shouldn't have taught him everything he knows, then. Here, come on. Anyway, I got another job for you, Ash. - What is it? - A job, Ash! Doing what you do! Sure, just not a good job. All the good jobs are going to Uziel. Okay. All right, maybe you don't take it, I got somebody else in mind. Can I ask you something? When's the last time you got a little keppi? Yeah, you. Come on. Get outta here. Tell your mother I'll call her later. I don't know. It's been awhile. Why don't you make a date with Marina? No? Why no? Look out there, man. It used to just be dumpy Puerto Rican girls and Hassids with ten kids. Now, they show up every day with the shorts cut off like they do. We're not an order of monks, Ash. Everyone needs a little keppi now and then. Thank you very much. Thank you. - Yes, sir? - Club soda, please. Thank you. If you find anything in there, I'll split it with you. What have you done? You weren't supposed to kill him, that's my part. I barely touched him. He said some shit in Chinese, grabbed his left arm, hit the floor... Heart attack? - Saved me a bullet, I guess. - Saved me a blowjob. - Just leave him, Asher. - I can't. Why not? He's not going anywhere. There's a plan here, Marina. Well, plans change, Asher. That's a good thing, no? Hey, Marina, uh... I was thinking... - Um... - You want to make a date with me, Asher? No, no. No. That's... That's not it. I just... Thank you for... helping me tonight. Anytime, Asher. Call me, will you? And tell Abram to call me. He still owes me from last time. Avi. Hello, Asher. Can you imagine they still make... clothes from this stuff, huh? You remember? Change of days. Changed days... Um... You know how I am with... favors. So... You know there had to be extenuating circumstances for me to come down here. If you need a favor, why not call on Uziel? And who says I didn't? Ah. - Unavailable, I assume. - No. Uziel and I talked and we ended up just talking about you. I need someone... I can rely on. I need someone with a... a history. We have history, hmm? Rafi's been killed. And his wife, Laura. And their kids. At their home. Do we know why? Probably a new crew. Testing the integrity of the organization. Who are they? They have no kind. Various, uh, ex-military... - Like you and me. - No. No. We have a kind. I want you to keep this very, very quiet. I don't want you to tell even Abram. Three jobs. One would just not send the right message. Rafi was a good soldier. Let me see your hands. The hand of a God. In his home... Asher... Shit. Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, uh... No. No, don't get up. Are you... are you sure? It's okay. Wait! Oh! Uh... Uh, I could call you an ambulance soon! - Where did this happen? - In a hallway. - At home? - Work. Were you running at the time? You know, if I do my job right, there's usually not much running involved. Turn around. How's Abram? He's good. He still owes me from the last time. Shirt. Jesus, you should have come to see me sooner. We never did get all those... those bullet fragments out. Okay, it's okay. You were in a rush. It might have been okay five years ago, but... You're gonna need to get some X-rays. See what's left in there. And then I'm gonna have - to open you up. - I'm fine, Doc, I'm fine. Are you fucking kidding me? It hurts me to just look at it. And I want you to get some X-rays! What do I owe you? This is why you keep having these blackouts. - It's gonna spread into your blood... - Doc. - ...to your lungs... - Doc! Just give me something for the pain. Excuse me? Hey! Excuse me? You got a problem? Ew! Can I help you? Can I help you? For the ones I broke. I'm Asher. That's an interesting name, Asher. I'm Sophie. You should've waited for an ambulance. I've seen lots of people get into those things and not come out on the other end. Thought I'd take my chances on the subway. You could say the same for the subway. I guess you're right. No place is safe, is it? Well, it's pretty safe right here. I got something for you too. Do you always walk around with an umbrella on a clear day? You always leave music on when you're not at home? I don't like walking into a silent apartment. I don't like getting caught in the rain. Well... thank you for this. Are you feeling better? I am. Thanks, again. You know... I cook. - I'm sorry? - I mean... it's what I do most every night, I cook. Eight o'clock. - Every night at eight? - Every night. What if something happens? Hardly ever does. I could cook for two. Are you a good cook? If I have somebody to cook for. I'm not much company. Not much would be an upgrade. Tomorrow night. I'll make enough for two. If you come, you'll have a great meal. If not, I'll have lunch for the following day. I'm glad you're feeling better. Good night. Fuck. - Good morning. - You're not the regular girl. Goddamn it. Why do they keep switching people? I'm gonna complain. Oh, you're welcome to, but there's no one left. I'm the last one and if you get rid of me, no one's gonna come. It's me, or nothing else. Did you remember the cookies? - Yes. - Oh, good. You look like shit. You look like a shit hanging out of a horse's ass, that won't quit. What an imagination. I know who you are. You told me once... you couldn't... look after your baby, so your man left ya. You couldn't hold on to your child, so your man left ya. Oh... why do you even come back? Well, you just keep coming back. You'll come in here, all cheery, with a bag of groceries. And you'll find my foul... rotting corpse on the linoleum. Stinking up the joint. And it'll make you sick. Okay, Mom. Hello, Asher. Can I have one of these? If you can spare it. Everything all right, Marina? Everything's fine. I'll be honest with you, Asher. Avi told me it was your birthday. I know it's a lie, but... I came anyway. So? What do you say? Shall we pretend it's your birthday? Excuse me. - Hello. - Hi. Please. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm interrupting. No, no, no. Not at all. Uh, Marina, Sophie. Sophie, Marina. Marina and I were... just going over a few things for work. For work. Yes, and I got thirsty. And now, I got hungry. So... I'm gonna go grab a bite. Any suggestions? Restaurants are good. Restaurants. Thank you for the drink. Happy birthday, Tin Man. Bir... Wait, it's your birthday? Apparently. - Well, I didn't bring anything. - Oh, no, no. How could you have known? I'm going to warm up some dinner for you. No, no, no, that's okay. I don't want to make any trouble. I'm not troubled. That's no trouble. What were you doing in my hallway? I figured... if I was going to pass out, in front of your door would be as good a place as any. Does that happen to you a lot? First time. Where do you work? In a ballet studio. - Hmm. In Brooklyn? - Mm-hmm. This place is pretty empty. Things have a way of gathering dust. I'm sorry, I can get rude when I'm nervous. I noticed. It's almost charming. I don't know, maybe I don't have a lot of things, but... what I do have is my home. - So, what do you do? - I'm sort of a contractor. You've done that for a long time? Very long time. Did you ever think about doing something else? Turns out, I have no other skills. Who's that? Casualty of life. It's okay, you don't have to tell me. She was French. You got any pictures like that? Yeah. A few. Why did you open your door? Any other girl would have called the cops, or locked up. You didn't. Why? You were right. About what? You are a good cook. Asher, come in. I got good news for you. Yeah? Avi sent down another job for you. - What's it pay? - Your usual rate, plus 25 percent. - Twenty-five? - Twenty-five! You, and a couple of guys. Wait a minute. Crew? No. I don't work with crews anymore, I work alone. - Avi knows that. - It's 25 percent above your usual rate, it's what you've been asking for. - More money, better jobs. - I don't work with crews! Always messy! Some guy has a bad day, his girl breaks his heart. Somebody cuts him off on the expressway, next thing you know, the walls are repainted with blood. It's good money, Asher. Uziel asked for you. - It's Uziel's crew? - It's a good job, what you do best. Are you Asher? Yes. Well, I'm not supposed to say this, but he has been walking around differently all day. Differently? Nervous. I've never seen him like this before, that's why I noticed. - I'm Hannah. - Hello. You can go in. He's waiting for you in the back. Thank you. Asher. Come here. What do you think? Huh? Yeah, it's a beautiful house, Uziel. - It's nice, right? - Hmm. I made you some coffee. - We can have whatever you want. - No, it's good. - You've been busy. - I have. Seems like all I do is work. Avi keeps me and my men busy. - He's the boss. - Yeah. I suppose he is. It's nice. Having moments like this. When I do, I always think, "Asher would like it back here." Hmm. You're upset about the out-of-town job. I told Avi, I said, "That's Asher's job." But... but like you say, he's the boss. Politics, I guess. I could've used you on this last one. I lost a man. Yeah. Took home a little memento, myself. Well, you've always been a tough son of a bitch. I wasn't always that way. - I owe that to you. - Nah. Some things you just can't teach. Yeah, well, Avi's getting old, right? Sour? He's losing sight of some of the angles. Well, he didn't lose a man, and smuggle home some lead on a job, so... What do you do, then, with a man like him? What happens in our business when you get too old? Well, there's no retirement home for us. - I told you that. - Why can't it be a long life? Hmm? I got a girl, she's pregnant. We'll have a family in this house. Why can't it be a full home? Maybe you should ask Rafi and his family. Don't be angry with me. I used what you taught me to make a life. Uziel... I just came here to see the gun. This is the gun I taught you how to shoot. Nothing like the original. Be nice having some legitimate backup for a change, huh? Yeah. - You have a wonderful home. - Oh, thank you! Hope you're very happy. - Uziel. - Yeah. Dora. I got your medicine. Ugh. What is that smell? Oh... oh, God... Oh, God, you couldn't make it to the bathroom in time? Well, it wouldn't have happened if you got here on time. Oh, God, it's everywhere! Well, clear it up! That's what you're here for. Just... just stay there, okay? Just stay there till I get it all cleaned up. I don't care about that. You won't help me because you're... - too fucking selfish! - Selfish? I... I pick up your groceries, I help you with your laundry, your... I do your hair. I come here every day. I clean up your shit! The dogs have got it right. Go out into the woods alone, and die in the leaves. Give everyone a break. I wish I were dead. Oh... Mom. Mom Mom, I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm your daughter. I don't have a daughter. Sorry. Yeah. - Bye, Sophie! - Bye! Hello. Uh, how did you find me? There aren't that many ballet schools in Brooklyn. That music, my God. How beautiful. Yeah, it's... It's from this ballet. - Look, I gotta go. I can't... - Something wrong? Uh... Uh, I don't... I don't want to talk about it, okay? There's nothing you can do. - Well, let me come with you. - No, not today. Sorry. Back up. My mother has dementia. She asked me to kill her. Imagine actually killing someone. I could never do it. I mean... who gets to decide whose life is worth ending? What if it was a matter of survival? What if it was kill or be killed? What, that's different. Then I'd kill. - And how about Hitler? - Hitler? - Oh, definitely kill him. - All right. So... it's not the killing that's the problem. Sometimes I have fantasies, I just... I walk into her room with a big gun and bang, - I shoot her. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pull it back just a little bit. I know. It's an awful thing to say. Besides, you wouldn't want to do it that way. There are a lot of better ways to do it. Like what? How 'bout poison? - Like a pill in her food? - Mm-hmm. - But she could spit it out. - Hmm. How about an injection? Nah, she's afraid of needles. - That wouldn't work. - Ah. You could suffocate her. With a pillow over her head? Probably wouldn't take too long, especially if she was already asleep. Yeah, I still don't think I could do it. - Maybe you could do it for me. - Me? Just say the word. It's not funny. It's hopeless. - Uzi. - You good? - Good. - There's room in the back. Something on your mind? I heard they call you the Tin Man. What's that about? Hmm? Got a heart problem or something? You like musicals? How long you been doing this? Long. Army? Was, yeah. I just got back. Fucking Mortaritaville. My ears are still ringing. Rockets coming down, by the time I got up, I busted my ear drum. Could've been worse. I could've lost my balls. - Lyor. - Huh? Asher doesn't talk too much, why don't you leave him alone? Oh, is that right? You shoot nice? Mm-hmm. How many you shot? I killed four fuckers over there. Didn't even see me coming. This your first job on your own? After the army? Yeah... You'll probably be the one to fuck everything up. Well, if I get into anything too hairy, I, uh, I'll be sure to signal for help. "Help! Tin Man!" This new kid... Yeah, don't worry. I'll keep an eye out. - See you on the other side. - See you on the other side. Go. You can set it over there. Asshole. Don't say a fucking word! Stop. Just stop, stop right here and think about this. - Shut the fuck up! - I don't know who you're - working for, but before you... - Shut the fuck up! Drop your weapon. Drop the fucking weapons! Okay, I'm walking out of here right now or I'll cut his throat open. Do you hear me? Drop your fucking weapons! I'll cut him right fucking open! Hey, hey, hey! Oh! Huh, baby? Hey! Tin Man! Tin Man! What'd I say, huh? I told you I wouldn't fuck things up, right? Didn't I say that? Huh? Huh? I told you! Oh, yeah. No, I know, I know. Sorry, he doesn't talk. Hey, Uzi! Man! You pissed all over him. - Asshole. Shut the fuck up. - Here he is, Uzi! Sorry. You're not gonna thank me? - For what? - Saving your life. You should've shot him sooner. Thank you, for saving my life. Yet again. I miss working with you, Asher. It was a one off, Uzi. Why don't you stick around? There's some things I want to talk to you about. The future. Hmm? Hey. You're not too old, Asher. See you around, Uziel. - Taxi! - Sophie! What is it? Sorry, Asher, I gotta go. This shit never fucking ends. What happened? What happened? She tried to kill herself. - Let me come with you. - No, no. I'm coming with you. Hi, Sophie. Thank you. Who are you? It's Sophie. What do you want? Just visiting. Oh, well you can't stay. My daughter's gonna be coming here soon. Oh... Who are... who are you? That's Asher. Oh. He's like a ghost. I'm so tired, I'm sorry. Gotta have a rest. Wake me up before my daughter gets here, okay? Okay. I don't know what to do. I just... I can't watch this. I mean... If I could fix things, I would. If I could... remember things for her, I would do that. If I could... kill her, and take away this fucking pain, I would do that too. I would do anything. But... I just... Oh, I forgot to take me glasses off. Yeah. Thank you, Asher. Asher? Let... let's go. Oh, that's nice. I'm an awful person. Horrible. I mean... What kind of daughter would even... think about doing these things? A daughter who loves her mother very much. I thought you were gonna kill her. Sorry, Asher, you don't deserve this. Ah, well... Who ever gets what they deserve? Can we just... pretend this never happened? Start again? Asher. Asher, hi! Um, Sophie. It's so nice to meet you. So, uh, what is it you do for a living? I'm a contractor. - What kind of contracts? - The... the, uh... um... Could you just excuse me for a minute? Bathroom. And here you go, ma'am. Thanks. Is everything all right? Yeah. What is it? What if I tell you I wanted to take you out of here right now? - Leave? - Mm-hmm. But our food just got here. I want to take you back to your apartment. My place? And I want to do it right now. Hmm. Why? I just killed a man in the bathroom, and I'm afraid if we don't leave right now, they're gonna call the cops. Hmm. So it's true. What's that? Men will say anything for sex. So, why'd you have to kill that guy? He tried to kill me. Does that happen to you a lot? Actually, no. This one was new. Hmm. That's concerning. I agree. So, am I safe here, then? Mm-hmm. Good. Mm. Pasta for breakfast? I could definitely become addicted to that. - You sure you don't want some? - Hmm. I only have time for coffee. Of course. But if you'll have me... I'd come back. Then I'll be waiting. Hey, Asher. Somebody came after me last night. They found me... and they came after me. What'd he look like? Like anybody else. But I knew they were one of us. I wasn't alone, Abram. - I was with somebody! - Hey, calm down. I'll try to find something out. What do you know? What do you know, Abram? There's things you don't know... - What kind of things? - ...Asher. Changes. Changes you don't want to know anything about. This have something to do with Uziel's job? Huh? - Delivery. - Just leave it there. Okay, Ash... there's a protocol, here. I get the information, I pass it along, action gets taken. Let's stick to protocol. That's our dance, here. I need to know who it was. Go home, and I'll call you when I know more. How do I know home is safe? Because I'm telling you it is. Have I ever let you down before? Come on, trust me. Go home. Drive! I... I tried to hide, like he told me, he told me to. They fucking found us, man. Fuck. They got Uziel. They got everybody. - Who did? - I don't know! You think I fucking hung around to ask their names? - How'd you find me? - What? - How did you find me? - Uziel told me. Were you followed? What? I'm not a fucking idiot! All right? Stay there. Ah! Fuck! Ah! What the f... No! Uzi's never been here before. He has no idea where I live. Fuck you. Fucking Tin Man. Fuck... Start talking. Who did this? Wouldn't you come after us if we pulled a fucking job - like that? - It's a job like any other. You can't be this fucking stupid. Huh? It's a fucking takeover, you moron. Your boy Uziel and your best friend, the fucking tailor. They wanted Avi's operation. You're lying. - Avi is after all of us! - Bullshit. You're bullshit, you're fucking bullshit! - I know Avi, bullshit. - So does fucking Uziel, where the fuck is Uziel now huh? Where the fuck is Uziel? Last chance, kid. - Why are you here? - Fuck you. They said I had to kill you... so I can live. You, or your girl. Oh, hey. - Hey. - Uh... Sorry to bother you. - Uh, it's okay. - It's Sophie, right? Right. Uh, I'm waiting for the landlord... to fix the burner on my stove. I'm sick of waiting for him. I know, he can be slow sometimes. He's the worst. Uh, I'm trying to fix it myself. I'm missing a part, I think. Do you mind if I just, maybe, take a quick look at yours? Uh... sure, come in. Oh, that's my phone. One second. Hello? Yeah, can you hold on one second? Just go ahead, it's right there. I'll be right back, okay? - You won't even know I'm here. - Okay, great. Hello? Oh, I'm so sorry about that. Yes, this is Sophie. Um... Uh, what day? Tuesday? Uh... I think we can make that work but I just have to... I have to look at the schedule for a second. Yeah. Well, how else is she thinking about them? Okay. Yeah, I... I think that probably should be able to work. Yep. We should... Yep. Let's put that in. That sounds good. Okay, thank you so much. - Ah! - No! - No! No! Shit! - No! No! Oh, Jesus! No! Fuck! No! - Sophie. Sophie, look at me. - No! Look at me! I know this man. I know his people. I know what he can do. - We need to get out of here. - What? We have to go. We have to go. We need to call the police. And say what? That a man broke into my apartment. That he was trying to kill me, and that you shot him. - That's the truth. - Well, then, why are we running? I can't go to the police. Contractor. I'm so stupid. Why should I go with you? Because I'm the only one that can keep you safe. How can I trust you? Because you know me, Sophie. You know me. Ticket. Thank you. Where are you going? - Bathroom. - I'll come with you. I want to go alone. You'll be safe here. Wha... What was it? Nothing. An animal. Where are you going? I have to finish this. It's no life... jumping any time we hear a noise. And you're just gonna leave me here? You'll be safe till I get back. If you get back! Don't expect me to sit around and wait. My only reason to stay alive is the thought of you. And I will get back. I swear. - Nothing. - Yeah? - Are you trying it? - Yeah! There we fucking go. Okay. It's ready. Tell them dinner is ready and they can come up. Hey you guys, come up. Dinner's ready. All right. We're done. - We good? - Yeah. All right. Let's go up and get some dinner, man. Yeah. - All right, we all set? - Nope. You guys get that? Come on up, dinner's ready. You know, if they don't come up... then it's going to get cold. And good manners. Here. And then... - Salt? - Uh, salt, yeah. I always dreamt of... a poetic kind of death. Whoever gets what they deserve? So, I get to be killed by my own man, in my own home. I'm not here to kill you, Avi. I'm here to plead. I have heard many pleads in my time. But never have I heard a plea from someone who is still on the handle side of a gun. I beg you, Avi... You're begging me for what? A life. All I want is a life. And everything that has transpired? What? It's to be forgotten? No. But we can't go on like this. Not anymore. And if I can't oblige you? Then... you will get a poetic death. What did you expect me to do? Huh? Let Uziel betray me? Hand over to him everything we've worked for... all these years? And for what? Because he's... he's married with a wife, and he has a child on the way? I didn't know anything about it. Yes, you did. I didn't know what they were planning. Well, then, you should have. Where would you go? What would you do? I don't know. I never thought... that it was going to be you, Asher. You look hurt. I'll heal. I went by your place. I don't live there anymore. I waited. I don't want to spend my life hiding. You won't have to hide anymore, Sophie. My mom's dead. I guess... she finally had more courage than I did. I'm so sorry. There's no more looking over our shoulder. We can have a future together. We don't have a future. Oh, Mom! Why are we doing this video again? Because these videos will have your stories on them, in case you forget them. Oh, okay. Well, I hope I don't forget. I hope I don't forget them. But, if I do... Mom? Mom, are you there? Um, I'm sorry, Sophie. That's what I wanted to tell you. Don't regret anything in your life. I love you, you know. I love you too, Mom. I'm looking for a contractor. Subtitles by explosiveskull
