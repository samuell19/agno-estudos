'Cause I pressed them. Shouldn't I press them? I press yours. So I pressed them. What do you press his stuff for, it's all the same for him. Where should he go? Wherever. Out of here.

Everybody has coloured nails. Look, I have to go to babysitting. Don't you want to come with me? - What baby? - That silly baby of my sis Are you waiting for something from the post? My fucking passport. Who is this? My sister's child. If it would have been born. She is weird to hang it on the wall. Isn't he ugly? What's his name? Krisztián. Aren't you hungry? Why do you come here with your bitch? She is not a bitch. You can go and fuck her somewhere else. I have only come to babysit. Well, see you guys. - Do your hair, will you. - All right. - What do you think you look like? - How? - Did you talk to your boss? - I did. - And? - Not enough money yet. You said we would go back together. Take me with you. All right. I'll take you once. - Now, today, okay? - Okay. Soon. But don't just keep promising. You silly little chap. I sure am... Here they are. I have to go now. I'll call you from Hamburg. You always say that. No, I will. You promise? Yes, yes, I promise. Every week? Yes, every week. Take care. You can keep some of this shit. Not these. I'll keep that too. You had nothing on, so why take anything, right? I paid the bill, right, honey? Is this your gratitude? I'll take this one too, get out but quick. Suck him and the other little fags, and next time you get yourself pregnant you'll see who sorts things out. I don't get what you think they want? They only want to fuck you. Nobody will take care of you like I did. Maya, Maya, where are you going? Let's give it another try, shall we? Don't go, don't do anything, I'll pack things out, all right, where are you going, you'll catch a cold like that... Sweep it all up into a pile and crap on top of it. The key, give me the key. Here's your bloody 3000, I'll take the baby. You won't touch that baby. They told me at the local council that with the baby I can get a flat, - - and I will be back with the police tomorrow and- - I will prove who the mother is. What do you want indeed? I want my baby back. You were weeping with your big belly that you will throw the baby to- - the garbage, cause your boyfriend will kick you out. You said- - you would kill the baby and yourself. - So what? - You got your money. Don't do this. That is my child. I bore him here. All right, go ahead. Where is he now? At home. Right, then get him. Not now. Tomorrow. When are you coming? Opening time. Don't try to trick me. I'll be here. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. That's good. Hi Maya. Hello Peter. Here is your passport. And that this 3.000 euros. Take it. You're like my child, and Krisztián, he's your brother. This girl will forget the whole child. She's just upset now. Don't let her come here again. Okay? She mustn't come here. Neither tomorrow, nor any other time. Okay? Or you're not my child. Go now. Take her with you. She would like it. Calm her down. She would love you too. For all I care. The two of you... What do you say? Go, have fun. Who did you nestle up to? Will you do this for me? Fucked up place. Come, let me show you something. Ever been to such a place? Leo, come here, can you hear me, come here, all right. See, it's harmless, give me your hand. I'm telling you, it's harmless, come, give me your hand. Really, I wouldn't do it otherwise. Let go of me! I'm telling you, it's harmless. What's wrong? There's no danger when they don't have a baby. No danger then, can't you believe me? They only go nuts when they have a baby. Just like people. Women go bananas, but men too, when they have a kid, see? When they have a kid, they're at it all the time, lick it all over, and keep kissing it, and weeping about it. I mean these are really lucky. They can be with their kid all day. But these at least don't weep. They are just listening. What are you staring at me for? So I have a problem with your sister tomorrow. Yeah. Tomorrow, and the day after, and after that. Clashing in the morning. Sure. Help me. Sure. Then will you come with me? As a wittnes. To a wedding? Not wedding, the guardianship office. It's not against your sister, only I need the child. This is how it worked out. Your sis is always ranting about this, - - and you known he's my child, and that's that. Don't accept sweets from strangers. You're my friend. You're not a stranger. We can get to the sea by then. Let's say eight o'clock, right? By eight we'll be there. Bathe, then lie in the sun, - - you'll love it, won't you? So I'll see you there at eight? Sure. There, by the sea. Listen, I have to do this with you... She can come and see him, and go walking with him, and- - she can babysit him, while I dance in Budapest. You can dance with me down by the sea. I have a lot of money. I'll go only with the child. What do you need that child for? - Because he's mine. - But he's not. But he is. He is, don't you understand? We'll make another one, how about that? We can start now. Are you fucking nuts? I need that child. We'll buy one. You're nuts. I'm not like your sis. Come to the sea with me. Come on, come to the sea. Not now. - Why not? - Later. I won't have time later. So, are we settled for tomorrow? Sure we have. We're going to the sea, to the sea, get in... Come on, I'll start the car, and off we go. Not now. What do you mean not now? I can't now. Why not? They're expecting me at the guardianship office. Who the fuck cares about the guardianship office? I do. So what is it, are you coming to testify tomorrow? I've told you. But then, are we settled? Cross your heart? Sure. You're really nice, after it, OK? - Where are you going now? - Home. You want my testimony, but no to screw with me? Are you nuts? Stop it. What the fuck are you doing? Let go of my shirt, damn you. - Fuck you! - What is it, you want trouble? Let me go! You fucking idiot. You ruined everything. You can be sure my sister won't ask for this one.
