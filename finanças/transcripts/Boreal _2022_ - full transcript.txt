Give me a glass of ice. Here you have it, sir. Thank you. I'll go to the other side! Take it over there. Leave it there. I'll be back in 15 days. Bye. If you want something, tell me now. Alcohol. Aren't you asleep yet? Not yet. Come here. You should be sleeping... tomorrow will be a long day. I'm sleepy but I can't sleep... it's too hot in there. Drink! Drink more! I'm telling you to drink more! You're doing it wrong. Give me, I'll show you. Put your foot in here. Try again. Do it hard. You weak! You're talking nonsense. I will cook. Go bring more poles. It's so early yet. I'm so tired. I won't work today any more. Poor you, this is nothing... Don't be a sissy. Fuck! Hurry up Benjamín. You're so slow... What's happening to you? Are you okay? Nothing... It just fell from me, uncle. Don't. Let's bathe more. Maybe my debtors are waiting for me at home... I will hide from them. I will buy for my motorbike. If you say so... Do you think you can live for free at my house? He will run empty in a week. Girls are very smart now. They are the ones who support me... He hasn't even kiss a dog. I'll show you how... Give me your hand... Take your hand... and in your fingers... you should spit... then it will go easy. Them, it will crack. You'll hear it. Two or three days will hurt you... You're talking shit. I'm all grown now... I will marry after all this. I want to see that. You have to start practice. That's why he only wants to go to the pigsty. He killed to death a pig? You are so annoying. It wasn't just one... The other day he made two of them to cry heavily. I've never saw her like that. So beautiful. You're mine, I told her. The room was freezing. Are you cold? I asked her. She couldn't speak any more. Why did you kill her? I just touch her. She was so cold. I was crying by her side. You will never leave me. You are mine. This happened because of you. I told her. Are you being funny? What's coming up with you? I didn't want to do it. It just happened. Forgive me. I believe you... Where are you going, again? I have to take my medicine. Enough... Don't drink any more... What's happening? Benjamín! Come here! Right now! You mother fucker! I didn't do anything! Don't be a thief... One is missing. Enough I told you. You won't wake up tomorrow, again. Where's my alcohol? You shitty boy! Tell me! I don't know where it is! It has to be you... or did it fly? I didn't touch anything. Don't be like that... Don't drink any more! The Mennonite is coming tomorrow! I don't care about anything. It has to appear here! Benjamín! Come here to work. There! Come, cover this. Bye! I'm leaving. It pass his hour to come. He's about to arrive. You will see. It's unusual that he's not coming. We just are hurrying up. Come... That bastard Mennonite... He will know who I am when he comes. Don't talk like that. Look... We have nothing... We will become dust. My son. Wake up! Wake up my son! Let's go... Did he arrive? Let's go to cook. Come... Uncle! Uncle! He arrived. We're leaving... The sir... Good morning boss! Good morning. Can we talk, César? Yes, boss! Everything okay here? I'm so tired. The journey was long. I will see the work tomorrow. Take the tent, César... ...and build it right there. And you go lift the things from the pick up. Your order! Thanks, Ramón. This will heal me. Likewise. No, thanks. How is the boy doing? I don't know... I told his uncle many times not to bring him. But he came... He's young. Maybe he doesn't like it here. He's old enough to work. That's why he came with his uncle. He just wants to play. Put some more flour... I want to hear. Take the pan out. Come. We will stay longer, he said. Stay where? Tell us right. He wants us to stay longer to work. It's not much what is missing. He complained about our work. Bad work he said. I won't stay any more. How many more days? I think that in a week we will... finish. It's up to us to determine. If he's paying more... But... I'm kind of tired also. We didn't talk about that. But I will tell him. Are we going to work for free? Don't hurry me up. I will talk to him. Go find Benjamín before he does something nasty. What are they saying? It's a news. It's 12 o'clock. Five minutes missing. Just in time. Take it. It didn't look fine what you did to the boss. You shouldn't do that. Why did you come in the first place? Do you want me to tell the boss? My uncle should tell him. Why don't you go to tell him yourself? No, he will tell me. You can't know that. What's happening with you? You came in here. Tell him! He's leaving. He's fed up with everything. How are you going to leave? There's work to do yet! I don't want to stay any more. Don't you understand? He wants to leave from long ago. How can you leave? Go tell the boss to take me with him. He won't take you. Don't talk like that! Are we going to stay alone? Let's all go. Go tell the boss we are going to leave! If I didn't need it! Do you think I want to be here? Go tell the sir! I will tell him tomorrow. Take it. He's just taking breakfast calmly. He won't say to him anything. He won't dare to do it. You go tell him. I'm not the manager. It's César who should tell him. Go tell my uncle to talk to him. The sir is leaving. You go tell him, quickly. Go talk to the sir. Boss has an angry face. He won't like it. I don't want to stay any more. The sir is leaving! Go talk to him! Uncle! Go tell him! You can't do anything without me! Have you load everything? Yes. Boss... We want to say you something... Yes. Tell me. Talk. Many days now... This boy has to leave. But there's some much work to do yet... César. It will delayed us. I'm sorry, boss... He got bad from me. I brought him. It's my fault. We are in a season of a lot of work... just to leave it like that. I'll be back in three days. This Mennonite is a liar. We can stay three days, boss. To take me with him, uncle. But take this boy with you. You shouldn't do this, César. The word must be fulfilled. I will bring replacements. Get in, boy. Pass me that. And the knife also. What's happening to you? Hey! You're working so hard! What for are you doing that? It's useless your work. We have to finish... Hey! Hey! We are so few. I'm losing my head! I dare you to do it. Do it! Stay still! Stay still... Or you will know. You will go to jail, again! I don't care about that. Tell me! Tell me... Tell me. Tell me. Let's go! It's not long... We are arriving. Get up and come. Hello. Did you arrive fine? Yes, sir! This is my son and Gaspar. I told well not to bring young ones. Only adults. Get in. Let's go. They never understand. Latins.
