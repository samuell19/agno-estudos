Yeah, I get people like you in here from time to time. What's wrong, big city not exciting enough for you? You gotta get your kicks driving all the way up here, pokin' your nose in where it don't belong? Didn't your momma ever tell you, curiosity killed the cat? I'm in a kind of a hurry, if you don't mind. Yes sir, Devil's Den sure has its share of scary stories, I'll tell you what. You know the thing I like about those stories? It's not me up in those woods, running for my life. It's not me being torn to pieces before my very own eyes. No sir, I'm at home. And that scary stuff... that's always happening to folks like... This just in... they are now offering a reward of two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars to anyone who provides information leading to the capture and arrest of Josef Hofer. Police are warning the public that this man is armed and dangerous. Police will be providing further... Where's the goshdarn map?! No. No! Mein herz ist klein, lass niemand herein, als dich mein liebes Jesulein. Mein herz ist klein, lass niemand herein, als dich mein liebes Jesulein. Mein herz ist klein, lass niemand herein, als dich mein liebes Jesulein. It's fine. Just relax. It's fine. Hello? Ah! Ah! Josef? Sorry. I'm sorry! I love you, Josef! I stayed under the blanket the entire time. I swear to God, I stayed under the blanket. I swear to God, I stayed under the blanket the entire time. You were just gone so long. I... I started to think that maybe something... No! Josef?! Josef! Josef! He's gone! He's gone. Don't look. You should really dress warmer. Especially gloves. I've never felt hands so cold. Josef will be back soon. Please... don't tell Josef about my pants. He'd be very upset. Go to bed, Mina. What is he doing here? Isn't she just lovely? You said he wasn't coming back. The apple of my fucking eye. Go to bed, Mina. Now! ["For The Damaged" by Blonde Redhead} He's here? Hey! Stop! Stop! It's against the rules! Hello? Stop! Josef is coming! Hey Nate, you alive out there? Hey Angie, sorry about that. I was following that map from Harry's place and I got a flat tire. Well, why didn't you say so? Where are you? I'll come pick you up. I'm up in Devil's Den. Angie? Yeah, sorry... I'll... I'll get someone up there to help ASAP. Just hang tight. Hey Angie, what was the make of that car we're looking for? 2001 Subaru Outback, maroon. Why? Keep me updated on that tow. Hey! You okay? You are Alex Whitman, right? If you had any idea how many people are looking for you? Are you alone? It's okay, I'm a police officer, I'm gonna get you out of here. My car's just down the hill. It's got a flat tire, but my partner is just on the way. He went to the house. What's that now? Jesus! He's in the house. This is the police! Just come out with your hands up, Josef! Whoa. Hofer, you are in there? I found the boy. It's over. You have until the count of three. I will shoot. One... This is not a game. Two... Goddam it. Hey. Ah! Back-up! I need back-up! Nate? What's wrong? I need your help... please! It's not him. It's coming for me. I don't know what it is, but it's not human. Nate, slow down. I can't understand... It's not human! Nate! Nate! Talk to me! Nate! Big mistake. Bring me to Josef! I hate you! Ah! He's dead! Josef's dead! You know where he is, don't you? Whatever I did, I'm sorry. Just please, please take me to Josef. Then we'll leave. We'll leave you alone. We'll never come back. Stop! Why wouldn't you just go away? Why won't you just leave me alone? There's a number I need to call if something bad ever happens to Josef. That's the rule. I don't care about your stupid rules. They'll come get me. Josef's friends. They'll come here and get me... and... Stop talking. - We leave you alone... - Stop talking! The others? They'll follow. They always follow. - If you're lying to me... - I'm not. I promise. I'm Alex, by the way. These woods are cursed, you know. Why do you think they call it Devil's Den? There's this monster that roams around, stalking the woods, hungry for human flesh and bone. It used to be, you know, like, you and me... But then, something bad happened to it. Something really bad. They say it has claws like knives, that it uses to tear people apart, like, arms and legs flying everywhere... And that it uses its razor-sharp teeth to bite into people's hearts while they're still beating, just so they can watch the moment they die. You won't scare me. Ask anyone. She's real. So, it's a she? Wait. Listen. You promised. They're getting closer. Hold on to me. Why are we stopping? Down here! Wait! Wait. - What was that? - Shh! You got anything there? Hey, have you gotten any signals? Hey, over here! Keep moving! We should keep moving? They won't find us here. We've been here for hours. - We need to find a phone... - Enough with the phone! We'll go in the morning. I'm starving. Josef promised he will get me cereal yesterday but... Do you know Josef? No. Why do you think he's dead? I saw him. But if you don't know him, how do you know it was him? It was him. It could've been anybody. He didn't smoke or anything. He just... He liked to burn things. He did that to you? It wasn't his fault. He told me... bad things would happen, if I... if I... I was still learning the rules. There's one... when we are in the car? I have to keep on my invisibility blanket. And if I'm completely covered and really, really still... I go invisible. I know it's not real, but... I don't know... I always liked that one. You can have it. What you were telling about these woods being haunted or whatever... you really believe it's true? I know it is. So you believe in monsters? Yeah. Me too. It's Mina. What? My name. What did I tell you about locking the door? What did I say? Don't. Good. That's good. It's okay. You like that? I bet those boys at school can't touch you like that, huh? Tell me how much you like it. Don't make me ask. Tell me. Tell me. I like it. Yeah? I like it. Damn, girl. What's gotten into you. Ah! Fuck! You fucking... Mina, stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! Mina. Mina, it's me, it's Alex. Are you okay? Yeah. Nightmares? Me too. - Your hands... - Yeah. They're cold, I get it. No... they're not. Wait here. Where are you going? To find your stupid phone. George, what are you doing? Can someone hold this stuff, I have to take a leak. I still don't see what you need a knife for. There's three of us against one of him. What's he gonna do? Did you hear what the cops said he did to poor Nate. Ripped his throat clean out of his friggin' head. That's bullshit. They're just saying that so they scare folks off, have less competition for the reward. Look, I'm just sayin', that's what I heard. It's not bullshit. We've all heard the stories about this place! What ever it is, it's out there. A normal person did not do that to Nate. Jesus, George, for the last time... Look, I know what I am talking about, okay. I know more about this place than anyone. I already told you, if you're wanna tag along I don't want to hear no more about ghosts or goblins or any of that crap. We're all are here with one plan and one plan only: that is to find Hofer and the kid, bring him back to the Sheriff and collect the reward. Now if you wanna try to be useful you help me set up camp over there. I'm starving. Where are we going anyway? Mina? Mina? Mina?! It was coming from over here. Alex? Alex Whitman? Hey, uh, it's okay, son. Don't worry, you're safe. My name is Theo and this is my brother, Henry. And my son, George. No, I'm not Alex. You're wrong. Go away! Calm down now, kid. We're the good guys. We're gonna help ya. You're lying. They're lying! Mina, they're lying! Don't listen to them! Who're you talking to, Alex? Is Josef nearby, Alex? Is he here? Is he watching us right now? Come on out, Hofer! Try, uh... picking on someone your own size! Please, please, don't do this. There are rules. He's going hurt them. - Pop! - Yeah, what? The girl who disappeared when I was a kid... ...the one that lived in the house that Nate got killed in... her name was Mina. Shut the hell up, Georgie! You're spooking the kid. Hang on Henry, just... How could the kid know that? She's real. She's the monster and she's gonna rip you to pieces! Do you have your cell, Henry. Yeah. Call the Sheriff. Tell him we found the kid. Tell him better to get his crew here quick... George, let's get her. Oh, shit. Help! Somebody! Please! Somebody help! I need help! Please! Somebody help! Please don't! Shit. Are you gonna kill me now, too? - That's what I thought. - No. I need you to dial. 5-5-5... 7-4-5... 5-6-8-7. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hang it up. Hang it up! It is, it's hang up. Who was that? No signal. Well let's... try again. Give me the number. Did Josef scream? Did he cry? Did he piss his pants? I need to know. He tried to run. It was quick. That's it? Yeah. How did it feel? I don't know. Tell me. Like... Like, I just wanted him to go away. Yeah. You can leave if you want. Leave me, it's okay. I won't tell anyone. I promise. Don't let go. Wait here. Please leave a message after the tone. Mama? Mom, are you there? If you're there, please pick up the phone. Me and Jeff are still in the woods looking for the missing kid. I... I just wanted to call and make sure you're okay with all this craziness goin' on. Maybe we can stop by later? Sorry to bother you. Just... call me. Okay? A little late for Halloween, isn't it? Looks good. I would hate for my baby here to make a mess of it. My friend, he needs your phone. I hear they have a phone at the morgue. I don't want to hurt you. It's burning my mouth but I don't even care! You didn't have to do that. I was protecting you. There's a phone here. Is there any more soup? I was thinking, maybe... Never mind. Stay. Just... until they're gone. Until it's safe. I mean, we have this house now and... and there is food and it's warm and... Hello? Who is this? Look, I got a call from this number earlier. Why you keep... It's you, isn't it? Please... just... stop this. Please. Give me back my son! Stop. Stop... Hello? Hello. Okay, well put me though the right person than. Yes, I need to talk to someone right now, it's an emergency! He's my boyfriend, of course I... Of course I trust him. Why am I still on the phone? Why am I still talking to you?! Why aren't you out there looking for my daughter?! Oh my... Mi... Mina? Baby, who, who... I mean, what... Mina? Please, look at me, baby. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Oh, my little girl... Mina? Mina? I'm just gonna check on Mom. Mina! Alex, I'm fine. Alex! Ma'am? Hello? We're on Devil's Den Road... the one that cuts through the woods. Okay. We'll have someone there any second to help you. Just hang tight. Thank you. Help me move him. - I think it might make things worse. - Mina? Mina, is that you? They said they'd be here soon. They'll know what to do. My husband? Alex... It's okay, I'm here. Mina, Mina... It hurts, it hurts really, really bad. I called the number, Alex. Your mom misses you so much. You can go home. It's okay. No. He's gonna hurt them. No. No, Alex. Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. You don't know Josef. Josef, he's gonna... he's gonna hurt my family. He's gonna find them and he's, he's gonna... No, no, Alex. It not what's going to happen. Please. He's gonna find my family. He's, he's... He's gone. He's gone. He can't hurt anyone. I promise. I don't wanna to be scared anymore. You don't have to be. Please, I just... I... I know. I know. It's okay? Me, too. When I was laying on that bed... I was thinking about when we... get back... that maybe I can get my eyes fixed. Do you think maybe? Yeah, I think so. Alex? Alex! Alex, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Mom? Mom? She's coming. She's coming, Alex. Mina, where's my mom? I wanna, I wanna see my mom. I'm not gonna let them hurt you. I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you ever again, okay? Let's go home. Let's go home, Mina. Let's go home. Mina! Mina! Mina! Mina! Mina! Mina! Mina! Mina! You okay there, hun? Are you lost? It's freezing out here. There's nothing for miles around. I can give you a lift somewhere. Bus station, gas station... wherever. It'd be no trouble. Please, hun, get in the car. It's not safe out here for a young girl like yourself. That-a-girl. Now, don't forget to put on your seatbelt. You can never be to safe. So, where are you headed?
