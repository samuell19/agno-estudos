(slow music) (rustling) (gentle music) Should we go get some hot cocoa? Yeah? Yeah? (laughs) Are you cold? Me too. Let's go in. It's wet, honey. Hey, pumpkin. Are you thirsty? Want some water? Want some blue water. Blue water. The blue water? Which one is the blue water, honey? That's green. All right, hot chocolate. Let's see what we have. Cheers? Pick your cup up and give Mama a cheers. Like this. (cups clink) Winter, come here. Pay attention, love. "The sheep ran, huddling..." Oh, no, no, no, you can't draw on the book. Come here. Come here. Mommy and Winter, we flew from right here all the way down to a different country, Mexico. That's why we put this tack here. So what country is the blue country? Thank you, that's great. Here, I have an idea. Why don't you, while I'm reading to you, what you can do is you can trace my letters, okay? All right, do you want to, do you want to say them with me? A. A. (indistinct) Hmm? Winter? When did you do this? It looks like a snowflake. What color is that, honey? Winter. Winter. Honey. Hello, Winter. (sighs) What are you doing? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. I got the paint. Winter, can you say five? Five? Here, let's get rid of this page so you have a clean page for your numbers. (paper tearing) "The sheep ran, huddling together against the hurdles, "blowing out thin nostrils "and stamping with delicate four feet, "their heads thrown back "and a light steam rising from the crowded sheep pen "into the frosty air. "As the two animals hastened by in high spirits..." Winter. How's the homework coming? [Winter] All right. Let me see. (slow music) Um. Good effort, honey. Can I... What are you doing? What are you doing? Why are you doing that, Winter? Honey, I think you're hungry. Can I make you something to eat? Why don't you take a break? Hi, Ms. Mason? Hi, it's Mrs. Knight. I'm so sorry to call you at home. (sighs) Is this an okay time to talk? It's Winter. I just... We're having a hard time with pretty much all of her homework. Could you give me an idea of how she's doing in the class? Actually, I've been meaning to schedule a conference with you. Winter is falling behind in every subject. Except for art, that is. Oh. I guess that's what I thought I would hear. What, what can I do? I think it would be wise of you to get Winter tested. I can recommend a neuropsychologist if you'd like. Okay. All right. I'll send you a text with his contact information. In the meantime, I'll work on creating some accommodation for her in the classroom. That should take some of the pressure off. Okay. Ms. Mason, do you have other students that you create special accommodations for? Never mind. Thank you. [Ms. Mason] You're more than welcome. Have a good night. How does soup sound? Sounds good. "Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. "Place one tablespoon..." (clatters) Wait, how are you doing that? [Winter] The words aren't jumping around. I didn't know that they did. [Winter] Neither did I, I just thought it was normal. [Olivia] Let's see... [Winter] "Sing, sing, what shall I sing? "The world is full of wonderful things." Upside down, huh? You can read upside down. Hold on. "Once upon a time, there was a family who lived together "in a little house in a wood." Honey, I don't understand this. I don't know what's happening. Babe, you can read. Do you, do you know what this means? How was the book, honey? It was great. What was your favorite part? I don't remember. Well, what was the book about? I don't remember. It must not have been very interesting then. But I really loved it. Well, do you remember anything about it? No. Honey, I think you're tired. I'm not, I'm just stupid and you know it. Don't ever say that. Okay? Why not? It's the truth. Winter. Don't worry about the book, okay? I want you to get a good night's sleep. You have a big day ahead of you. Good night, honey. (book thuds) - Hey, Winter. - Hey, Sage. Is that a new hat? I don't think I've seen it before. Yeah, I got it for Christmas. It's so cute. Thanks. So you ready for your spelling test? You're kidding, right? I've flunked every spelling test I've ever taken. You know, I've heard that doctors are terrible spellers. Well, maybe it's just their penmanship that's bad. Anyway, did I tell you I was going to be in the spelling bee? No, you didn't mention it. Yeah, I'll be competing against the sixth graders this year. Cool. Sorry, I didn't mean to brag. I don't even want to be in the stupid spelling bee. My dad's making me. In fact, I'd rather scrub toilets, come to think of it. Come on, Winter, the bus is here. (engine rumbling) Winter, we've gotta go! (slow music) Winter! Honey. What are you doing out here? You had me worried. Another bad day at school? I hate school. I want to quit. No. Honey, you can't quit school. That'd be like Dad quitting his job. But that would be good 'cause then we could see him more. Hey, can we talk about this in the car? You're already late for your appointment. What appointment? Did you forget? We're going to go and meet the neuropsychologist. But I don't want to. It won't be that bad. I promise. Come on. Hi, Dr. Newman. Yeah, I haven't actually had a chance to look it over, but I have it. I can bring you up to speed. I got the findings right here. Basically, in a nutshell, your daughter is profoundly dyslexic. She also has moderate attention deficit disorder and her processing speed is extremely low. On a positive note though, she has extremely high IQ. In addition to that, her fine motor skills are off the chart. Although that won't help her academically, her IQ will. Okay. So what are your recommendations? Our recommendations are pretty clear. We feel that she should transfer schools to a school with a really good special needs program. I would also recommend that we start her on Adderall, in addition to... [Olivia] I'm sorry, I just... You lost me at Adderall. I... You want me to put my nine-year-old on a stimulant? Mrs. Knight, with all due respect, she can either be a lawyer or a lunch lady. Frankly, it's your choice. You've certainly given me a lot to think about. Thank you. (paper rustling) Hi. What are you doing in here? What's Addenall, Mom? Addenall? Adderall. Were you eavesdropping? I heard you talking about me. I'm sorry. I was going over your test results with Dr. Newman. You got a second? I suppose. Well, they confirmed what I already knew. And that is, you are a very bright girl. There's just a few learning challenges that we need to address. Dr. Newman believes you'd benefit from special education. But everyone would make fun of me. No, they wouldn't. You're going to be in a completely different building. If you don't want people to know, no one will know. Don't make me leave Sage, Mom, please. Babe, you can see Sage after school. You can have her over to the house whenever you want. Besides, you're going to be making new friends, friends who are your age, friends who have your own same abilities. You mean disabilities. Winter, Dr. Newman is an expert and he wants you to succeed. I trust his judgment. Well, I think it's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. I'm not asking you for your opinion. I'm transferring you on Monday. Go ahead, but you'll be sorry. (kids chattering) Did you see that girl? She's reading her book upside down. [Girl] Yeah, I noticed, it's kind of weird. She's probably illiterate. [Girl] What's that? [Girl] It means she can't read. Are you okay? Never been better. Something's wrong. Come on, Winter. You know you can tell me anything. It's just that they were making fun of me. [Sage] For what? For reading upside down. Why were you reading upside down? I always do. I read better that way. Seriously, Winter, I always knew you were a genius. You're a modern day Leonardo Da Vinci. What are you talking about? Haven't you heard of Da Vinci? He just happens to be the most famous artist ever. Of course I've heard of him. My point is, he wrote everything in mirror image. He probably read upside down too. People say his dyslexia is what fueled his genius. Really? I had no idea. Sage, the bus. Come on, let's go. Sorry, I can't. I don't understand. I'll tell you later. Bye. (slow music) (knocking) (door creaking) What are you doing on my roof? (dog barking) Well, I've got to do my homework. Do you have any art supplies? [Sage] Sure, what do you need? Just some colored pencils. Okay, give me a second. Thanks. She's right here, one minute. Hey, Mom, it's for you. - Oh, thanks, honey. - You're welcome. Hello? Oh, hi, Olivia. Is everything okay? No, we haven't seen her. Oh, Olivia. Oh, I can't imagine what you're going through. If there's anything we can do to help, please, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you. (door creaking) Sage, Winter's missing. We have to help find her. Come on, hurry up, let's go. [Sage] We're in big trouble now. (helicopter whirring) (siren wailing) Winter? (phone ringing) Hello? Hey, Lisa. What? Hi, Kelly, this is Kris. I just got off the phone with Olivia and I guess Winter didn't show up to school today. Since you're her babysitter, I just thought you might have some leads. Hey, Jennifer, we got to go. Hey, I'll call you later. (slow music) When's the last time you saw her? When we were at the bus stop. [Girl] What was she wearing? I don't remember. [Woman] Did you talk to her? Uh-uh. [Man] Are you sure she didn't say anything? [Sage] Nope. [Woman] Winter? Winter! Winter! Winter! Winter! (siren wailing) Come on. But we didn't find her! I'm exhausted. (door creaks) [Sage] Good night, Winter. (Olivia crying) Oh no! No! No. (siren wailing) Oh no. No, no, no! (knocking) Excuse me, ma'am, is there supposed to be a kid's shoes on your roof? What? (Olivia crying) Winter, I need you to listen very carefully. What you did last night was really wrong and it brought distress not only on me and your mother and the Petersons, but really on the entire community. And you were complicit, Sage. You should've known better than to go along with a deception. Your mother and I are very disappointed. What do you girls have to say for yourselves? I knew it was wrong but I did it anyway. I don't know what I was thinking. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry too. I'll never do it again, I promise. I think we're all very heartened to hear this, but what you did was really quite severe and it's essential that there be consequences for your actions. And your mom and I have talked about it and the consequences for this are that, effective immediately, you are not to see Sage for an entire month. You have our full support, Charles. [Sage's Dad] We'll see to it that Sage complies with your request. I really hope you girls have learned a lesson. (slow music) (Olivia sighs) [Winter] Mom, I'm home! I'm in your room, sweetie. [Winter] What are you doing? I'm just organizing your things, honey. [Winter] Thank you? Have you ever heard the definition of insanity? I don't know, maybe. It's doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. So? I'm kicking myself, honey. I should've done this years ago. I think it's time we pull you out of school. Really? Yeah. Except that the operation is subtraction. Look at this example. Have you looked at this already? Um, no. No? To accomplish good. He initiated many reforms, such as greater conservation of natural resources and better food inspection law. The president shall be commander in the chief of the Army and Navy of the United States and of the militia of the several states. When called into the actual service of the United States, he may require... Winter. Honey, are you listening? (thumps) How is this any different than school? Can't we agree this isn't working? When am I even going to use any of this? Why can't I do something meaningful for a change, like get a job? Maybe then I'll start retaining what I learn. That makes me nervous. What makes you nervous? Setting aside academics. It's always the academics for you, isn't it? All the money you poured into vision therapists, tutors, special diets, special programs. And for what? Why can't we stop fixating on what's broken and start figuring out what I'm good at? Maybe then I'll stop being such a loser! Okay. I think it's time we start to work on your resume. Hello? Yes, this is Winter. That would be great. Mm-hmm. I'm totally free. Yeah, thank you. I'll see you then. Bye. What was that? [Winter] I just got a job offer. That's wonderful. I think my granddaughter would like this. All right. Okay, I'll just ring you up. And are you paying with cash or- - Yes, with credit, please. All right. And would you like your receipt? [Customer] Yes, please. Okay. Here you are. Would you like me to wrap the shirt for you? Would you, please? Oh. It seems like you charged me more than it said on the tag of the shirt. Would you just check that again, please, for me? Yeah. Yeah, it looks like I accidentally charged you twice. I'll just... I'll get you a refund. [Customer] Okay. You know, I'm gonna go talk to my manager. - Okay, okay. - Yeah. You can't even imagine how mortified I was. I swear, I just wanted to disappear. So you're not good with cash registers, big deal. That's not a reflection of your character. You know, my dad's friend owns a bicycle repair shop and I'm pretty sure his secretary just went out on maternity leave. Maybe you could fill in for her while she's gone. All you'd have to do is answer telephones. I suppose I could give it a try. I'll talk to him about it. Thanks. So, what are you doing this weekend? I'm flying to Pasadena with my mom. What's in Pasadena? A college we'll be touring. Oh. My dad really wants me to be a lawyer. As you already know. If it were up to me, I wouldn't even go to college. Really? Why? I know it sounds crazy, but I just want to be a mom. If I could do anything, I'd stay home with my kids and write novels in my spare time. Have you told your parents that? No way. They'd never understand. Do you know what time it is? Um... No, but I should probably get going. Me too. Bicycle Repair, Mason's Bicycle Repair. Mason's Bi- (phone ringing) Mason's Bicycle Repair, how can I help you? Can you hold for me, please? Hello? Oh no. (phone ringing) I'm so sorry, sir. Let me transfer you. (phone ringing) Mason's Icicle... Mason's Bicycle Repair. I'm so sorry for hanging up on you, sir. I'll... I... I don't know what I'm doing. (phone buzzing) Hello? Oh, yeah. I'm free tomorrow. Great. I'll see you then. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hey, are you Winter? Yeah. Let me show you how to muck a stall. [Winter] All right. All right, over here. Get under the poop. And then just scoop it in. Okay. (slow music) Excuse me? Yes? Are you Mrs. Baylor? I am. I'm Winter. We spoke on the phone the other day, about the job? Winter, you're fired. I'm sorry? You heard me. You put us in quite a predicament yesterday when you didn't show up for your shift. In seltzer water now. That sounds disgusting. I know. It's on me. Don't have to do that. I'm not arguing. By the way, I hope you're not mad at me, but your shift starts in 30 minutes. What? Oh, you're joking! No. Winter, you have to stop running away from your problems! You can do it. [Customer] Hey. I'd like an eight ounce mocha, one less pump of syrup, extra hot, light on the whipped cream. All right. Can you repeat that? [Customer] Yeah, a eight ounce mocha, light on the whipped cream. Okay. And can I just get a name? [Penelope] Penelope. All right, Penelope. Your drink will be out just a minute. [Penelope] Thank you. (buzzes) Wow, that's impressive. Oh, um, thank you. All right. Penelope? Here you go. [Penelope] Thank you so much. Thanks. Thank you. [Woman] Let's grab a lid. - Here you go. - Thank you. (slow music) Misty! Here, girl! Misty! Misty, here girl! Have you lost your dog? Yes, I did. All right, when was the last time you saw it? Years, now that I think about it. I believe she died several years ago. I'm so sorry. Oh, here. - Thank you. - You must be cold. Thank you. Can I get you home, ma'am? Margaret. My name is Margaret. What's your name, darlin'? Oh, I'm Winter. Winter. That's a pretty name. Unusual too. Thank you. All right. I'll drive you home. That'd be lovely. If I could just remember where I live. All right, well, I parked just up there. We'll figure it out. Thanks. It's right. Really, you could've just said no. (gentle music) (knocking) Winter, is that you? Yeah. I picked these. - Are those for me, darling? - Yeah. Oh, they're just beautiful. (cat meows) [Winter] Hello, Margaret. I brought you some cookies. Oh, thank you, darlin'. I can't remember the last time I had home-baked cookies. [Winter] Do you mind if I join you? Please do. I'm just sitting here going down memory lane, looking at this old quilt I made. It was for my daughter's graduation. Is this her? Yes. That's... Oh dear. Her name escapes me. I don't recognize her. Is she local? She lives on the east coast somewhere, I believe. I haven't spoken to her or heard from her in years, so I'm not really sure. I'm sorry to hear that. May I ask what happened? Well, Emily was very accomplished and I could never quite live up to her expectations. I know the feeling. Pardon me? I'm a little hard of hearing. That's devastating, Margaret. It is devastating. It was devastating. But then I found someone who loves me just the way I am. (phone ringing) Oh, there's the phone. I'm expecting a call from one of my doctors. I'd best take this. I'll have to see you again soon. Oh, I'd love that, thank you. Thanks for the cookies. [Winter] See you, Margaret. Winter. I think we need to discuss your prospects for the future. You can't keep going on making minimum wage. With no college education... You think I hadn't thought about that already? Okay, then let me in on some of your thoughts. I'm your mother. [Waiter] Hi, welcome to (indistinct), what can I get started for you guys? Drinks or anything? Yeah, can I please get some water without ice? [Waiter] Absolutely. What would you like? Oh, whatever, just order for me. [Waiter] Here's your water with no ice. Any questions about the menu? [Olivia] Yes. Happy you called. [Woman] Yeah, it's great that you could come What do you got? [Woman] So I acquired this painting last week and I want to know what you think. I don't know, I'm just not feeling it. Yeah, my sentiments exactly. I don't know, Beth, I've just about had it. When I started in this industry, I had no trouble finding good talent. That's my experience. It's very frustrating. [Woman] Yeah, I don't know what's happened. [Woman] You must be Winter. Yes. I have my work. Impressive, Winter. (sighs) Um, truly abstract and modern is what works for us. (door closes) (doorbell rings) [Girl] Hey, where's Blake? He's parking the car. [Girl] Oh, have you met my cousin? I don't think I have. [Girl] Let me introduce you. She did what!? I know! [Olivia] Winter? Whatever happened to the prom? It was boring, so I left. [Olivia] I'm sorry to hear that. You've been doing an awful lot of your art lately. Is that something you're thinking of pursuing? I just... I need you to support me, Mom. (dramatic music) (birds cawing) Margaret? Emily? No, I'm sorry. It's me, Winter. God has sent me an angel. Would you get me a glass of water, darling? I'm awfully thirsty. Of course. Here. Thank you. I'm so glad you're here. I think I've had a stroke. Do you need me to call 911? They're on their way. Would you read me a little from my Bible, please? It's such a comfort, Winter. "For this light momentary affliction is preparing us "an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, "as we look not to the things that are seen, "the things that are unseen. "For the things that are seen are transient. "But the things that are unseen are eternal." (slow music) (knocking) Come in! Hi, you must be Winter? [Winter] Yes, and you're Emily. I am, welcome. My mom left you a few things. You obviously meant a great deal to her. Thank you. I'll be right back. [Winter] "Dearest Winter, "I'm leaving you my greatest earthly treasure. "Within its pages, may you find the unconditional love "you've been seeking." So I was going through her things and I came across this. You're the artist, I'm assuming. Yes, I drew that for her. I don't know if you know this, but I'm an art curator by trade and I recognize talent when I see it. This is good work. Thank you. (knocking) [Emily] Hi there, I'm looking for Winter. May I ask your name? [Emily] Sure, I'm Emily. I'm an art curator and I'm hoping to see some of her work. Okay. Hi, Winter, how are you? Good. Good. I hope it's all right that I've stopped by. I found your address in the phone book, thought I would just drop in and check out some of your artwork. Oh. Actually, I recently lost a lot of my work in a fire. That's terrible. Regardless, I'd love to feature a piece of yours in a show. There's a show coming up in a week. Do you think you'd be able to handle that? I assume that involves compensation. [Emily] Yes, when it sells, absolutely. And I don't think I'll have any trouble doing that. Well, in that case, she's very interested. (birds cawing) How's your masterpiece coming along? Still waiting for inspiration to strike. You haven't even started? No. Well, what inspires you? People who persevere through great challenges. Can you push me? I can't leave Alejandra, sweetie, I'm so sorry. I have to be going anyway. - Alejandra! - Winter! [Winter] Can I draw a picture for you? Sure. Thank you so much. All right, what's your favorite animal? Robin. A robin? All right, I think I can do that. (gentle music) I knew you could do it. It's amazing. You must be very proud of her. We are, most certainly are. Great show. Tell me when she got started. [Mr. Knight] You know, she started making art when she was two. Is everything all right? Yeah. There's a gentleman over here, he's interested in buying your art. (gentle music) Coming down off the high already? I'm just thinking. About what, honey? It's just... It's hard to throw my heart into something that I know you disapprove of. I see now that discouraging you from pursuing your dreams was wrong. I'm so sorry. If you knew anything of my childhood, perhaps you'd understand. I don't know anything about your childhood. That's because I was too ashamed to tell you. Your grandfather was an artist like you. Only he never managed to get a following. He tried to support your grandmother and I, but he could barely pay the bills. Then he started drinking and we lost everything. We were homeless for a few years after that. I had no idea. Well, regardless, it was wrong of me to have projected my father's failures onto you. It's just that I love you so much, I don't want you to... I never doubted your love, Mom. Just always thought it was conditional. Winter. How could you ever forgive me? I already have. This is for you. [Alejandra] It's special. Just like you. So how's the caregiving going? Actually, I think I've learned more from Alejandra in the past few months than I ever learned in a classroom. How so? Imagine if all these alpacas were the same. Same color, same characteristics, same personality traits. [Sage] That'd be pretty monotonous. I've realized that our differences don't diminish our value. That's what makes us special. It took me 18 years, but I think I'm finally okay with who I am. Just okay? Hey, Winter, how's it going?
