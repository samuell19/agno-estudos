Can you see anything, Garr? No commander, just clouds. It's as if this planet were made of fog. Not even our infrared sensors can penetrate it. Yet their signal is still transmitting. It must be coming from that planet. The source should be at 15 degrees, quadrant Alpha 9. Yes, the spatial coordinates match those from the scope. This is our sixth orbit of the planet, the signals come from the same point. If there's a transmitter, it's definitely there. Another meteor going off course. Andy, Tiona, Kerr! Two more meteors off course, how many is that in total? - 999, Wess. One more and I'll make a cake with a thousand candles! Without our meteor shield, our ship would look like a sieve by now! - Prepare for landing. - Right. Attention all hands! Prepare for landing. We'll begin our approach in 5 minutes. The gravitational field strength will be seven G. Synchronise the meteor shield. Engage neuro-vascular pressure. Suppress nodes X, Z and Y Activate automatic sequences. Maintain a distance of 2 parsecs from our sister ship, Galliot. Activate confirmation signals. Command confirmation received. Sanya, get me the commander of the Galliot. This is the spaceship Argos calling spaceship Galliot. This is the Galliot, we're receiving you. Commander Nordeg is needed on the video scope. Roger. Mark, Nordeg is ready. You were right Mark. It isn't cosmic radiation, those signals are real. You were right. Good of you to admit it. It's about time! We're not as crazy as you thought. They thought it until a minute ago! Oh! So you have a spy on board. You must admit you were lucky. We can't believe every noise the universe makes! Okay, it's not cosmic radiation. That doesn't mean there's life. How do we know there's intelligent life down there? It could be a natural source of radiation. We'll know in a moment. Let's prepare for landing. Synchronise for a seven G approach. I'll switch to automatic control. Yes. Once our distance is two parsecs. - One moment, Mark. - What is it? Your little brother wants a word. I wanted to say that after this... What's happened? Restore our link with the Galliot. Galliot, respond. Galliot, respond. We're listening. Calling Galliot. Our link has gone! Try the emergency channel. The signal has gone, Mark. The planet has stopped transmitting. The radar pulses have gone. Sanya, get me the Galliot! No signal! We've lost the radio link. How can that be? Try again! It's hopeless! Even the emergency channel is down. Keep on trying. Red alert! The emergency lights have come on! We're out of control! Gravitational strength is off the scale! Wess, what's the display showing? Twenty G's. Sealing all compartments. Muud! Disengage the autopilot. I'll take manual control. What's going on? Why did she attack you? You did too. Don't you remember? Have you all gone mad? Stop it! Eldon! What's happening to us? What just happened? - What's going on? - You don't remember either? - But I... - Stop, Dr Karan! Karan's gone mad! As I was recovering, I saw him hitting Muud. I leapt at him, but he ran off. - Stay here. Wess, come with me. He's using the airlock! There's nothing we can do. The doors won't open yet. Let's get our helmets! What happened? How did I get out here? Luckily, the atmosphere is breathable. I'm not sure what's going on. A few of us have been acting like lunatics, then forgetting what happened. Do you feel better? - I think so. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm fine. Get back on board. There's injured crew to take care of. Nothing serious, but I'd like you to check. - He forgot everything too. - How can that be? Something must be causing this. No sign of the Galliot. It doesn't look like we've taken any damage. We should check the ship. No damage. It's as if it was an easy landing. Let's double check on board. I know it's a mystery, but we must stay calm. Let's try to understand what happened. The autopilot went haywire. We'll know more once Wess has checked the flight data. The gravity suddenly increased. It reached 40 g's. Only a planet with a thousand times the mass... could create that much gravity. That's not all. When you blacked out, I thought we were going to crash, but the gravity decreased and the landing was gentle. Then everyone started going mad. If you hadn't held out, we'd have killed each other. It's a real mystery. What do you think, Dr Karan? I don't know. I can't understand it. A force greater than 25 G's will kill anyone in seconds, but we... Galliot calling Argos. - Quiet! - Galliot calling Argos. We're detecting strange... This is urgent... That sounded like Nordeg. Try to locate them. Keep trying, Sanya. Garr, use the infrared scope, they can't be far. We need your help... Argos calling Galliot. We read you, Carry on transmitting. Give us our coordinates. Hello? Hello? Respond! Argos calling Galliot. I've found them! It's the Galliot, alright. They're on the other side of a burning swamp. Get a fix on their location, we can use the thrusters. We'll be with them any minute. The photon generators are completely drained. Is there a plausible explanation? One more mystery... Let's cross the marsh. The temperature is typical of lava. I don't care about that. Can we cross it or not? I can't be sure. There are lots of rocks, we can use them. With a bit of luck, we can move from one to another. Let's try it. It's all too clear. They killed each other. Just as we would have done, if you hadn't stopped us. I'm afraid so. The madness that affected us... was no coincidence. It was intentional. But who did it? And how? What about the others? Once we find them, we'll know. Your brother too! Poor Wan, it was his first mission. The doors are sealed from the inside. We'll need the disintegrator. - Four bodies. Where are the others? They're not in there. - Let's search the ship. No one in the upper section. What about the control room? Intact but empty. Search the corridors of the dome. Understood. Check the automatic circuits. When you're finished, Meet me in the atomic generator room. Did you find anyone? - No. The ship seems deserted. Let's carry on, the three missing crew members must be somewhere. Stop! Listen. It's coming from the shield room. Him too. We're only missing Nordeg and Keir. The meteor shield has blown. It's useless. The Galliot won't fly again. This ship's as dead as her crew. We need the disintegrator, I'll get it from our ship. It's too heavy for one person. First, we must bury our dead, as the law demands. The three of us will return to the Argos. Eldon, stay here on guard until we get back. Let's go. Calm down. Our planet's laws must be respected here as well. We mustn't cry when faced with death. It's a part of nature, we must accept it. We'll be back as soon as we can. Keep your eyes open. Wess, let's go. Eldon! We're over here! Help us! Eldon! We're back. Where are you? This way! Come with us. Eldon, answer me! Where are you? He might be inside the ship. Tiona, stay here. If there's trouble open fire at once Don't hesitate. The door's open. How is this possible? There were four bodies here. Where have they gone? The room was locked from the inside. Who opened the doors? This is crazy! Eldon! Answer! Still no sign of Nordeg or Keir. Vanished. Just like Eldon. What if all this was a nightmare? Maybe we just imagined it, an hallucination. I don't imagine things Karan, I saw those corpses. What if our senses work differently here? I told you, I saw them! I saw my brother dead. What about Eldon's disappearance? He's no ghost, we didn't imagine him! Let's try to think. There must be a logical explanation. For now, I think... What now? We weren't dreaming, this is blood! Those bodies were here. What happened? What did you see? Talk to me! - Let's get her out of here. Now! Let's take stock of our situation. We've been receiving signals from this planet for two years. Now that we're here, nothing. Yet the signals were real, regular and repetitive. Transmitted by intelligent beings. But there's no-one here, the planet's deserted. It just looks deserted, I've felt like we're being watched since we arrived. One thing is certain. If there is life on this planet, it's hostile. If the generators run out as soon as they're charged, how are we going to leave? - I'm trying to start the motors, I need to force them to convert thrust momentum... into electrical energy. How's it going? Will we make the next launch window? I've done the calculations, I just need to connect the circuits. What are our odds? Our chances aren't good, There's a risk the ship will explode. Start work tomorrow, get help from anyone you need. Let's all get some rest. We need it. We only have one escape plan, so I've authorised it. The risks are enormous, The ship may explode, killing us all. The situation here is untenable and it's getting worse. The invisible forces around us seem to be closing in, and there's nothing we can do. Captain's log, aboard the Argos, 10th day of month... - What happened? - He was deactivating the shield. Why would he do that? It makes no sense. I don't understand it either. Do you realise what you were doing? Yes... of course. I was completely aware of what I was doing. - What? - Something was forcing me. I was fighting it with all my strength, but it was useless. I had to disconnect it! - But why? - I don't know! It was like there was someone in my mind, trying to take control. Dr karan, what do you make of all this? I believe we all may have an enemy within us. How can that be? Why? There may invisible beings surrounding us, with the power to take us over when we're unconscious. It's true. They tried during the landing and again while we slept. If that's their plan, they won't take us by surprise. One person stands guard while the others sleep. Who's there? Stop! - What's wrong? - Be quiet! Come here! - What's happening? - I'm not sure. I saw some lights. There! Did you see? - What was that? What are they? What do we do? Mark was clear. At the first sign of trouble... raise the alarm. Guard post three! Emergency! Wess, come with me. The rest of you, stay alert! What is it? - I saw something over there. - What was it? - Glowing spheres. I barely glimpsed them but when I turned round, they'd vanished. They were there. - Where's Garr ? -He returned to Station 2. Keep your eyes open and don't let yourself be surprised. Stop right there! Who is it? Speak to me, what happened? Who was it? The captain... he... What's going on here? If we want to stay alive, we'll have to find out. Let's get him on board. Help me. There's nothing we can do. First, the crew of the Galliot, now two of our own. Garr is dead, Eldon's vanished and our enemy's closing in. - And making themselves known. - What do you mean? You saw something. Even if it was hard to identify. They were like globes of light, difficult to describe. If you blinked, they were gone. What could they have been, Doctor? The life forms here may live on another vibrational plane. Corporeal beings like us may not be able to see them or if we can, only briefly, in our peripheral vision. And the sounds we heard? Was that what they sound like? I think so. Tomorrow we'll bury Garr, leaving another grave on this hostile planet. Come on Sanya. - I'll be right with you. I'll remove his tags and complete his record. You're needed. I've still got Garr's tags. Give them to me. I'll finish his record. What's wrong? What happened? Garr! He was behind the cupboard! Calm down! Come with me. God of matter, who manifests himself in primordial matter, may Garr, this space man, become light in the dawn. We entrust him to you, make him part of the birth of a new world, atoms waiting to form new energy. We can't do anymore here, let's get back to work. Pass me that. Nearly there. - How do you feel Tiona? - A lot better. I know I didn't imagine it. - Of course not. - So? - I think we can do it. Another 20 inversions and I'm done. - How long do you need? - I should be finished tonight. We're going to scout around. Keir says he saw something in a nearby valley. Let's go. This way! Look down there! That's what I saw shining this morning. I was right. This time it's not a mirage. It looks like a spaceship. Finally, something that doesn't vanish when you look at it! It must be very old, look at the rust on the hull. I've never seen a spaceship like this. This shape is completely new to us. Look at that! It's horrific! Humanoids. Much bigger than us. At least three times our size. Keir, stay here and keep guard. - Okay. - Sanya, let's look around inside. If he moves, call us. Okay. - What is it? - I got a shock. - Where from? - There. That's a powerful current. What could it be for? Some kind of torch perhaps. Once held, it would light up. Beings this large wouldn't even feel it. Look what I've found! - What is it? It looks like a tuning fork. Maybe that's the answer! - To what? The airlock might have a sonic key. A lock that can only be opened by a specific frequency! What's happening? I feel like I'm suffocating! How is this possible? The air is being sucked out of this vent! We have to get out of here! If only I knew how that door worked! What if it's this? Keir! Where are you? He's disappeared, like Eldon. Maybe he realised we were trapped, and went to get help. Let's go. No, he's not here. I thought he was with you. What happened? - We'll discuss it later. Wait. Tiona's in shock. - What happened to her? - I was on guard duty, I heard her scream. When I reached her, she was pointing and saying, Darak... Wan. They're dead. There was no-one there! Perhaps it was a nervous breakdown. - Let's go and see. I saw them. I saw them clearly. I looked at them for a long while. - Who did you see? They were in the fog. Horribly wounded, covered in blood! - Who Tiona? Tell me. I stared at them. They haven't vanished! They were real. Not ghosts. - Tell me who you saw! Empty expressions. They looked insane! Guard post one. All guards, check in. Post two to post one, checking in. Nothing to report. Come in post three. Guard post three to post one. All clear as well. Nothing to report. Engine room, This is post one. Come in, Wess. How's your work going? I can't wait to hear those reactors, see if you can speed things up. I want to leave as soon as we can. Me too, Mark. I'm doing everything I can. I'm still inverting the inductors, I've nearly finished. Just a couple more circuits to go. Then we're leaving, or exploding! It's better than staying here. Hurry up. Who's there? Hold your fire! Don't you recognise us? Nordeg... Keir. We're exhausted. Can't take anymore. We remember the crash, then nothing. Until we found ourselves fighting... to regain our consciousness. We were completely lost. - What about you? - I don't remember either. Carry on. We wandered aimlessly, looking for the Galliot, but we couldn't find her. Then suddenly, we saw you. At least you made it. Go and get some rest now. - Thanks Mark. - You'll have to sleep in shifts, one of you needs to keep guard. That's an order. I'll explain later. - Very well. What do you think? I don't know. Shock after a trauma? Partial amnesia. Anything's possible. Either way, at least they're back and clearly alive. - At least that's how it seems. You used the word 'seems'. On this planet, many things seem absurd but are real. I saw the three men we buried. I know they're dead. But I saw them, and another too. - Who, Tiona? - Garr! Even though we buried him ourselves. I saw him. He was alive! I saw him! - Are you certain? There's a way we can check. You see? The grave's as it was. Keir and Nordeg aren't in their cabin. Have you seen them? - No. - And you? Let's look for them. - Nordeg? - No, I am not Nordeg. Nordeg is dead. I am simply using his body. I am an inhabitant of this planet. Before it's too late, we offer you another chance. We caused many of you to kill each other. We needed those bodies. But we are not monsters. We are trying to save our race. - At our expense. - You would do the same. Hasn't your race always done that? We have to fight to survive, even with desperate means. We exist on a different plane, but we have our limitations. We cannot build spaceships. Our sun is dying. When it dies, we will die too. We called you here so we could survive. Our transmitter has worked for centuries. Once, it was powerful, but now it grows weaker. Our sun can no longer power it. Luckily, you arrived in time. - Your message was simply bait. You sent the signal so you could steal our ship. Have you already tried with others? - Yes - The spaceship we found. But you also need dead bodies. We only need beings who do not oppose our will. Beings who will not fight us. Death is the final destroyer of will power. Even if we agreed to help, what can we do? Our ship can't transport your whole race. Only one of us needs to reach your planet, the others can follow his path. We'll never submit to parasites. If we unite with you, we will be as one. There would be no parasites. Come with us and you will save yourselves too. We don't want your deaths. Travel with us to your planet. - You'll never make it. - Yes we will, Mark. Keir has already taken your shield. That's all that we need to use the Galliot. So? Before I leave this body, what is your answer? No! Never! We'd rather die and save our race. You have the red key for the atomic detonators. Here's the green one. Take three plutonium charges. - What's going on? The Galliot and its crew of living dead must be destroyed, once we've recovered our shield. When will you be ready? I have to finish the photonic ignition, the rest is done. You stay on board. The others are coming with me. Once we've left, close the airlocks and turn on the monitors. When you see us return, begin the ignition sequence. We'll install the shield after take off. You'll be taking a huge risk. I wish it were the only one, but we don't have a choice. Get the charges. This is where we split up. Dr Karan, you and Tiona stay here. Cover our retreat. Remember, there's danger all around you. If we're not back two minutes after the explosion, run back to the Argos and take off. - But I... - That's an order! Let's go. - There's no-one in sight. - I'll go first. - You can't do this alone. - I know what I'm doing. It sounds crazy, but before entering the ship, I have to plant the charge and prime it. I'll set the timer for ten minutes, then I'll try to get the shield. I'll either succeed or get blown up. The plan's good, but you won't make it alone I'm coming with you. Maybe you're right. It's better if there's two of us. You stay here, we're going. Your brother. Poor Wan. He's become one of them. Let's set the timer. Are you ready? One, two, three. Let's go. We must get the shield. Come on. How long till the detonation? Only three minutes. Hurry up. Stop, Mark! Drop your rifle. I've been following you. Forget the shield. Don't you see? You've lost. If any of your will remains, let me go. All that remains of your brother is this body. That's enough... Kill me. Kill your brother's body! Here, Mark! Forgive me. There's no other way to get the alien out of your body. Hurry! We're nearly out of time. Here they come! They're being followed. We have to help them. Open fire! Stop them! Karan, Muud, Tiona. They're all dead. Dead? I'll fit the shield. You take the controls. It's tragic. Out of 18 people, only three of us survived. I feel guilt. - They died to save our planet. That's true. Imagine if those creatures had invaded our world. It's worse than a nightmare. Of course, it's tragic. It was only luck that saved us. Get some rest. You haven't slept for two nights. Sanya and I will take the bridge. I'm exhausted. Who's there? Is that you Mark? What do you want? Answer me! If I was not sure to be awake I thought I was dreaming What happened? I was almost asleep when I heard footsteps by my door. The door opened slowly, as if someone couldn't decide whether to enter. - Did they enter? - No, Sanya. Then you didn't see who it was. Yes I did. He was clutching his rifle. I saw his face in a reflection. - Who was it? - You're not going to believe me. I wish I was wrong. But it really was him. Mark! It was him! Waiting in ambush. Why? Did he want to kill me? What's your conclusion Wess? The only one. He's being controlled by one of them. That's impossible. Let's check. Wait! Wess has discovered who we are. Don't be scared. No-one's going to harm you. I don't want to kill you. - You're one of them? And you too, Sanya? This is terrible. You too. Both of you! You have to join us. You only have to agree. One of us can still reach you, you'll know the glory of our kind. My world will never be yours. Perhaps not. But you won't be the one to stop us. Yes I will! I'll stop you! Too many meteors. The shield is down. We'll never reach their world for the others to follow. - What shall we do? - Let's land on that planet there. We've no choice. We could be destroyed at any moment. I've already checked the planet, the atmosphere is breathable. It's the third planet of the star we call Sol It's so small it doesn't even appear on our charts. Will there be humanoids whose bodies we can enter? Even though it's in the early stages of evolution, I think there's life there. Activate visual enlargement. You see? It really is a primitive society. Only humanoids could have built those dwellings. They're still using cement and steel. Do you think they'll welcome us? I hope so. For their sake.
