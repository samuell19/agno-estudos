You are done! You hear me? Good morning. I made you a sandwich, but I'd appreciate it if you started packing your own lunch. Um, yeah, okay. Isn't this song a bit too much for today? How is it not perfect, huh? Yeah? Are you excited about your first day? Yeah, I... guess so. - You need to hurry it up so you get... - Mom, I know! All your new classmates will be waiting. That's exciting, isn't it? Actually, it's not. Remember you can't say "you" when you address them. - For real? So what should I say? - You need to say "Your Royal Highness." You've gotta be kidding me. No way! I Googled it last night. It's true. Later on, you can call them by their name, but, first, you need to follow proper etiquette when talking to them. They've been treated that way their entire life. They're probably a little soft. - Especially the prince... - Soft, right? As if. He's going to inherit an entire kingdom. Does this look soft to you? Prince Fuckboy? Are you serious? Um, that's great. That is not great! - Looks like he's having fun. - Oh my God. You know what? I think Lena should be glad to have such a special... ...experience many others would never have a chance to get. And I heard his mother, the queen, is pretty sick. She has some kind of chronic fatigue syndrome. Okay. I think. I read it in some gossip column. So I bet her son's going through a lot... Yeah, all right. I can imagine it's been pretty difficult. Mmm. I'm going now. - Okay, bye, Mom. - Have fun. - Yeah. - Oh, Lena? Hey, should I put the fish spread back in the fridge? Yeah, go for it. Don't forget. "Your Royal Highnesses!" No. - How do you think this year will go? - I think it'll be a good year. Do you know if the Queen will be returning? Very excited. It'll be fun to see everyone again. Uh, excuse me. Do you know where class 2STB is? - Yeah, it's right over there. - Oh, thank you. You got so shitfaced last night. - I didn't. - You did. - You so were. - That's a lie. That's a lie. That's a lie! Seriously, you need to pull yourself together. What are you talking about? You were completely out of it. Exactly. Exactly, man. You were so fucked up. What are you talking about? Oh my God, stop. It's not true. - It was ten minutes, tops. - It was for a half hour. I can hear you guys enjoyed yourselves this summer. Hi. Lene? Hey. It's so great to finally meet you. Oh yeah, my name is Ove. I wanted to welcome you. Welcome to our class. You will do great here. Bless the Fatherland! What's up? - Look who just showed up. - I'm very sorry that we're late. But Kalle had to make sure his hair was perfect before we could leave. Looking good, Kalle! - Of course he did. - It took him two hours. Two and a half, I don't know. - Hi. - Kalle. - Lena. - Lene. Pleasure. Len-a. - Hmm? - It's not Lene. It's Len-ah. You know... ♪ Come on, Lena ♪ Excuse me? - The Håkan Hellström song. - Okay. ♪ Come on, Lena ♪ Okay, forget about that. My mom was playing it this morning. It's her favorite. I don't know what you're talking about, but hi, Lena, nice to meet you. Everyone hurry and find your seats so we can start. Hurry up now. Margrethe, what did you think of the pen? Was that from you? Yeah, I just found it and it made me think of you. 'Cause you're a princess and stuff. - Okay, everyone! - Thank you. Yes. It's nice to have everyone here. First off, thank you all for joining me, and welcome back to school. Seeing all of your smiling faces is making me realize that our summer vacation is far too short. Okay, we have a new student joining our class today, and her name is Lene. She's sitting next to Karl Johan. So if you haven't had a chance to say hi to her yet, you can do so now. - Hey, Lena. - Hi, Lene. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Len-ah. - I'm sorry. - Her name's Len-ah. She's named after that Håkan Hellström song. Oh, let me see. Oh, what do you know? Lena. I'm sorry, Lena. I don't know how I mixed that up. I'll know it now. Lena, Lena, Lena. Okay, uh, anyways, you might have guessed, but I'm your teacher this year. Hi. - Good morning, sweetie. - We need more milk. - How'd it go? - Good. What were they like? Did you call them "Your Royal Highness?" Mom. Did they have bodyguards? It's unbelievable what they choose to spend our taxes on. Don't bring your political opinion into this. - The king seems like a nice guy. - I like that we have a royal family. - He genuinely seems to care. - The exact opposite of a democracy. They don't actually have any real power. It's vital for the monarchy to keep in touch with the people. - Well, but of course. Who said that? - Princess Diana did. - You like her. - Yeah. - See ya. - Working out? - Uh, yes. - Can you take Theodor with you? I'm going for a run. Up! Think of it as a training exercise. We need to make a run to the grocery store. Come. Hi. - All right. Add diapers to the list. - You ready? Whoa! You are done. Are you kidding? Are you cold, baby? Let's put on your beanie. Shh. Come on, let's get this on. Here's your jacket. Hey, it's okay. Let's get you out. Whoa! Lena? Are you also doing hill training? This is the best spot in Nordmarka. But from the look of it, you're not here for that. - Where are you going with that little guy? - Uh, he's my baby brother. Uh... We were heading to Ullevålseter, and then my phone... My phone died, and the stroller got stuck, and my mom's gonna be waiting for us back home and... I've never ran here before. Okay. So you're a little off track, am I right? Yeah. You can say that. Where did you start from? Uh, Grevling Street. By the tennis court. The tennis court? Yeah, it's right over there. Just down that path and you're there. Oh. Uh, okay. Shit, look, you were right. - That's a good thing, isn't it? - Yeah. Ooh! Was that fun? Sit down. There you go, little man. Thank you for helping us. No sweat. Anything to avoid running up those hills again. Ew! No, wait a second. Don't scratch. Wait, don't scratch, don't scratch. What is that? Just hold still. Uh... Ah! Look. It's intact. I hate bugs, so... If you end up getting a rash, uh, or itching, you should probably call your doctor. But I think you'll be fine. You don't need to suck out the venom or anything? - Isn't that for a snake bite? - Hm, right, yeah. There is a difference, I believe, between a tick and a snake. Thought so. Well, to thank you, can I offer you a ride to the party on Friday? Party? Yeah, this year's pool party at Ingrid's. Everyone's going. - Tomorrow, I can't go, so... - No problem. Like I said, it's Friday. I, um, I meant... I meant Friday. Mmm. Because? I have a bunch of homework to do, and we've some guests staying with us. Okay. One sec. I need a picture with my rescuer. Bring a swimsuit. Check it out. Well, look who it is. Our celebrity. Hi, Lena. We haven't been introduced yet. Ingrid. Hi. Pleasure. I'm Astrid. - Lena. - Hi - Fanny. Pleasure. - Lena. - So how do you two know each other? - Um, know who? You and Kalle? Yeah, just from class. Oh, that's great. So you two went for a walk in the woods together? - Yeah, it looked really nice. - Did you plan to do that? I went to go for a quick run with my little brother and we just got lost. It really wasn't that great. Well, seems like you two were really enjoying yourselves out there. I mean, I was just helping him remove a tick that was stuck on him. He was freaking out, so I just went and took it off. A tick, is that right? That sounds fun. Tess! Hi! You're back home so soon! Not exactly. The principal called me in to talk about all my absences. Then, I'm ready to go back to work. - That sucks. - Mmm. Anyway, you meet Lena back there? She's new. She was on Kalle's story. Lena, Tess. Tess, Lena. - Hi! Nice to meet you. - Hi. - You too. Um, are you Tessalicious? - That's me. Um, I follow you on Instagram. - Oh! - I really like your stuff. Thank you so much. It really sucks that I can't post anything from school because of our royal twins. It's pretty awesome when you get paid for making content but you can't film the one thing that makes up your entire day. But what can you expect when you have Princess Paranoia in your damn class? Princess Paranoia? I'll catch you some other time, Lena. See you around. - That is a very cute top. Is it new? - No, it's actually old. Mm-hm. - What's up? - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Hey. Thank you again. Uh, no wait. I mean... Damn, no. I'm just saying that I'm... Thank you for the stroller. Thank you as well too. You're welcome. Okay, everyone, please take your seats. That includes the crown prince and Lene. Shoot, I did it again. I'm so sorry. Lena. Come on. Let's go. Thank you. Lena? Lena! Lena, come downstairs please! His Royal Highness Prince Karl Johan has come here to see you. Hi. You have the cutest little brother. Thank you. I think he quite likes me. I only have a stressed-out sister who's five minutes younger than me, but acts like she's ten years older. Yes. - Yeah. - So... You have a lovely home. Oh yeah? Thank you. - It's nothing. - Unless... Yeah. Well, it's... - It's nice enough. - Mm-hm. All moved in then? - Yeah. - Yes, we are. - There's still a lot to do. - A few things, but we're pretty far along. - It's coming. - We're still putting things up. Photos and... - Curtains. - Curtains, yeah. - And lamps and flowers. You know? - And flowers too. - Things you put up. - Yeah. - So, yeah. - The garden's looking good. Very nice. It's actually full of ticks. - Oh really? - Mm-hm. - Gotta watch out then. - Yeah. I'm not sure if the outfit you have on is right for a pool party. Pool party, you say? Yeah, it's at Ingrid's house. It's tradition. - All right then. - Oh, that sounds like fun. Or we could just stay in tonight with Theodor. - Yeah! We could make waffles for dinner... - Yeah. A pool party sounds great. Uh, give me five minutes. I'll be right back. Hi! Thanks. How are you? Uh... can I please get mine in a lompe? Thanks. Woo! - Lena! Hi! - Hi! I didn't know you were gonna be here. It's so great to see you. Yeah, it is. God, you look really incredible. Thank you. You're looking pretty hot yourself. - I'll catch you later. - You're leaving? Uh, yeah. I don't really have fun at these parties. It would've been cool to hang out with you and all, but there's someone here who just can't seem to stand looking at my face. So, uh... Yeah, sometimes, I can handle it, and other times, I can't. So I'm out. It was nice seeing you. Mwah. Mwah. Lena! I'm so glad you decided to come, dear. - Here you go. Welcome to our humble abode. - Ah. And you're eating already, I see. Mmm. - Thank you for that. - Hey, I'll see you later. - Leaving? - Yeah. I don't really want to deal with her bitchy attitude the whole night. I'd rather go shopping at MAC At least I'll enjoy myself. Okay, but can you come back later when things start to pick up? Uh, maybe. Yeah, I'll try. But you guys have fun here. Okay? - We'll talk later. - Bye. Do you know what's going on with her? It's just that Tess and Margrethe used to be... It's a very long story. Has anyone introduced you to Margrethe by the way? - Uh, no. - Then, I'll do it now. Come. Look who I found. Hi. - Isn't this party really nice? - Yeah, it's nuts. - I'll get us some more drinks, yeah? - Thanks. Hi. I'm glad you came. Mmm. Hi. Yeah. Tell me, how are things so far? It's been a little strange to go to school with royalty. But I've started to realize that you all... You guys are just normal people. There are still a few things that are not completely normal about Kalle and I. I just wish that we had more of a screening process before people are placed in our class. Some people are just insane. And I'm not talking about journalists or reporters. I'm talking about ordinary people with cell phones and no boundaries. - I didn't send that photo to anyone. - You didn't? Drinks. What happened to Tess? Uh, she had to leave. She had some launch to go to. Hey, Lena, can you take this from me? I guess there's not enough royal gossip here for influencers to post about. Did you see what she was wearing? Like some wacky cat woman costume. I thought she looked pretty. - Excuse me? - She looked nice. Yeah. Are there any fashionistas in your little village, Horten? Such a cute dress. Hm. Where from? Cubus. Half price. 2018. Well, it's nice. Uh, we really should add you to our class chat. Yeah, sorry, I don't have social media. I deleted everything. Oh, shoot. Who did I just add then? Hope it's not some random weirdo. Let's see. Lena Karlsvik? Is this you? Yeah... I have Snapchat, but I don't use it at all. I've been trying to cut back on my screen time. You have an 1,100 snap score. Did you delete the old account and make a new one? There you are. Come with me, okay? I want to show you something. Are you good? Were my sister and her friends pestering you? You could say that. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah. Yeah? Wanna sit? Yeah. Why is there no one swimming here? If I had a pool, I'd be swimming in it all the time. It's a tradition that we have. First one who gets in the pool is Arnie. - But at the right moment. - Seriously? Yeah, no one gets in before. He's first. I see, I see. But then why have a barbecue if no one is eating? Hm, good point. Are you sure it was all okay with my sister? She can be tough. Yeah, no shit. She gave me her big speech and then she interrogated me. Gotcha. Most of us have known each other since middle school. I'm not sure if they chose their class or were forced to join. But it's important to maintain stability around the royals. Mmm. - Want some? - Okay. Maybe just take a small hit if it's your first time. - Good? - I prefer beer. I'm happy you're here. I only came 'cause you showed up at my house and made friends with my parents out of nowhere. - Mm, touché. - Mm-hmm. I mean it. That's sweet. But you're a prince. Mm, crown prince. Right, sorry. Crown prince, and a player. Player? - You always have girls around you. - Okay. - Okay? - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Hey, hey, hey. Shit. Sorry. Sorry. I probably shouldn't have seen that. I didn't mean to interrupt whatever you two were doing there. Hey, Kalle, you know me, man. I can't see very well with my glasses anyways. I'm just gonna look over there. Do some reconnaissance. What a dickhead. But, Kalle, seriously, you gotta help me out here. That could have been real awkward. - So what do we think? - From the balcony? Yeah. Hmm. Not close enough. It's like 20 meters between the balcony and the pool. - That far, huh? - Yeah. - No. - He's right. I just checked the distance and it's about 18 meters. But I found another place. Follow me. Fuck. Did you delete the old account and make a new one? Delete your fucking account, you stupid bitch! Fucking hell, get out of here! Fuck off, Lena! What the fuck are you trying to do? What the fuck are you doing? Are you fucking crazy? You almost drowned me! You can't just put people in a fucking chokehold underwater. It's totally normal to swim when it's... When it's a fucking pool party. Why even have a barbecue if no one's willing to eat? That's crazy! - Is anyone having fun here? - Come on, you almost drowned. - Just relax. - I was trying to do a fucking starfish! Thank you! Lena! Okay, guys, I'm jumping in! - Three! - Two, one! Wasn't I supposed to be your ride? Just figured I needed some fresh air. What are you on right now? Just the... The usual, and stuff. And what stuff? I tried a vape, Dad. You tried a vape? Just marijuana? - The prince didn't give you anything else? - No, no, no. I'm just not used to drinking that much anymore. Because there's a lot of that in those circles, you know? There are many pictures of that boy with drugs and naked women. I know. I've seen it. It says a lot about their perception of reality. How they connect to the real world. I think he's not that bad, Dad. It's okay, it's okay. Get it out. Get it out. Can't you just tell the prince what happened? What if you tell him the truth? Good night, sweetie. SNAPCHAT: FRIEND REQUESTS CLASS CHAT 1.5 HR AGO STAR OF THE EVENING A NEW WOMAN WENT DOWN KARL JOHAN! UNKNOWN: HAVE YOU TOLD THE PRINCE ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE SIDE? LENA + THE PRINCE =? VOICE MESSAGE FROM KALLE Sorry for yesterday. I'm sorry I had you in a chokehold. But I swear I only did it 'cause I thought you were drowning. So, sorry. But if you want, a group of us are going down by the water. Hey, hey. Would the starfish like to join me for a boat ride? Thanks for inviting me. Uh, for now, I'm still trying to get over my shock from being physically assaulted by the crown prince, but I, uh, thank you for thinking about me and for the boat trip invite. I have to stay and watch my brother, so have fun on the water, Mr. Crown Prince. I doubt you'll be swimming anyways. Cutie. Hey, come here, little cutie. Come here, come here! Hey! Did you just poop? No! We need to change your diaper. Do you agree? - Hey there. - Oh! Uh, hi. - Hi. - What are you doing? Thought I'd come check on the starfish. Yeah, that was... Sorry. Weird. Don't worry. You okay? - Um, yeah. - Good. - As good as I can be. - Cool. I'm kind of... - How are you feeling after that? - Fine. I didn't drink as much. Oh yeah, right. - I really had too much. - Yeah. How's your brother? Uh, really great. Could I hold him? Okay. Here. Ah, hi, Theodor! Uh-oh. Ah, Theodor! Here. Uh, I used to be big into baggy clothes, so maybe this'll fit you. I put yours in the laundry. Uh, thanks. Fits like a glove. Ugh, I'm sorry. Again. Sorry. - Don't worry about it. - I mean it. For everything yesterday. For the pool, and for... For getting incredibly wasted and not being on my best behavior. You were so nice and I was an ass. And then Theodor pisses on you. I'm sorry. Really. Oh. Oh, shoot. Hi, you two. Don't mind us. Or better yet, pretend we're not here. It's lovely to see you again, Your Royal Highness. I'm sorry. I mean, normal teen Kalle. Let me help you with those... No, no, no, no, no. I can do it. Don't worry. - You two go out and have fun. - Nice seeing you, Your Royal Highness. You too. So where is Theodor? - Uh, he's sleeping. - Okay, thanks. Great then. You're free to go out and do whatever. You can have the rest of the day to yourself. You should go hang outside. It's so nice. Don't waste your day sweating in here. - Uh... - You all right? Yeah. I just... You know when you bend down and you come up too quick? And the blood rushes to your head. Well, you two get out of here. Go enjoy yourselves. We can take the boat out. Hm? It only fits two. Yeah, sure. Just promise me you're not gonna save me if I start drowning. Drowning? Don't worry, Dad. It's a joke. - Whoa, are we taking the royal yacht? - No. It's out sailing. The King is using it for a regatta. Do you really call your father "The King"? Sometimes. The King and the Queen, yeah. Ta-da! It's not the biggest of boats, but it's all mine. It's really amazing. Okay. The police escort is waiting nearby. They've promised to keep their distance, but no less than a couple hundred meters. - Also, let's follow the speed limit. - Got it. Keep in touch. Contact me for even the smallest of things. Yeah, I know. I've only heard it a hundred times. Of course, Your Royal Highness. But I know our new passenger hasn't heard me say it before. Mm. I swear to God, yesterday, I shouldn't admit this, but I was both scared and fascinated by what you did. - Yeah? - You were like, "Boom!" Like it was... It was truly you. Might as well go for it. You're always your whole and true self. To hell with hiding who you are. - Mmm. - I really like that. You're tough and you're honest. Why did you move out here? Oh, you know, it got too exciting in Horten. Yeah, come on. Tell me. It's... My dad just got a new job out in this place, so we followed him. - That's it? - Yeah. Sorry, that's all there is. Got it. Don't worry about it. Hmm. I'm happy you kept that picture private. Were you checking my profile? Well, sure. We have people that look into those things. - Shit. For real? - Yeah. You're the first one not to spread gossip and upload pictures everywhere that were taken with the crown prince. A prince selfie? Sure. So you've seen that picture in the nightclub then? That one where you were surrounded by half-naked women, who probably had their tongues down your throat? And it looks like you just sniffed three kilos of cocaine? Yeah. That one. Hashtag player. Hashtag heartbreaker, hashtag... - Hashtag PrinceFuckboy? - Mmm. Things aren't always what they seem to be. People just see what they want sometimes. So then what happened? It was a party for a movie premiere. Margrethe and I were invited and I sat down on that couch just for a moment, just for a second, then those girls came. Hmm. It seemed pretty planned, because the person who took the pictures, they were in our group. Then all of a sudden, those pictures were posted all over the world. I must hold some family record. And yet... Whoa, whoa, whoa, look who showed up. His Highness and the starfish! I'm so sorry that I missed your little mating ritual in the pool yesterday. Jesus! - You weren't traumatized or anything? - No, I'm all good. So you lovebirds have your own plans or will you be joining the party? I have to go, but thanks for the invite. Okay. Kalle, you coming? Give us a sec? - Let's leave them then. - Thanks. You're not coming? No, I can't sit and listen to people calling me starfish all night. And besides, I had a really beautiful day with you, so I don't wanna ruin that. You're right. Today was very nice. It could've started a bit better. - Right? - No, don't remind me. Is it cool if I hang with my friends? Yes, of course. Thanks for asking me. If we were alone right now, I would be kissing you. Hm. How about tomorrow? I'll be home alone if you want to come to my place? Uh, where exactly? The royal palace? Sure. I can send a car to pick you up at your house. Are you kidding? Home alone at the palace? Yeah. Okay, I'm in. Okay. See you soon. - Woo! - Hey there. - Hey, come on. - Let's party, man. I'll inform the crown prince that you have safely arrived. Thanks so much. There you are. Welcome to the palace. Lena, is it? Yes. Hi. Uh, hello, Your Maj... Sir... Honor... The... The King. I think it was a good try. Come in, Lena. - I'm glad you could join us. - Thank you. It's nice to meet you. Thank you very much. It's also nice to meet the King. I understand you're in the same class as Margrethe and Karl Johan? Yeah, we're in the same class. Does he behave himself? Uh, yeah, I think he does. Good. That's great. Very reassuring. You came prepared, I see. Oh. I know Kalle will appreciate it. He loves his sweets. - Do you like seafood? - Uh, yeah. Especially king crab. Let's eat then. Hi, Lena. Come on in. - Hi, Lena. - Kalle, what the fuck? I'm sorry, but they changed their plans. I tried calling you, but... I'm very sorry. Thank you. Start on the outside and work your way in. Thank you very much. - Mmm. - It's good, right? I'm glad. We'll have crayfish as our starter, and fish for the main. Karl Johan doesn't like shellfish very much, even though it's been our dinner every Sunday for who knows how long. He'll probably get pizza later. In other words, he's a big man baby. This place is beautiful. Thank you, Lena. We are very happy with all... the renovations. - Where do you live? - Grevling Street. I hear that you're new in town. Mm-hm. Yeah, we just moved out to Oslo this summer, from Horten. Mm, from Horten? Hm. I actually have many good friends there. I go sailing with the mayor. I think he has a daughter your age. Have you met her? No. That's a little odd. How many people live in Horten? Several thousand. But how many mayor's daughters can you have in your class? - Margrethe. - What, Kalle? We need to check every little thing before introducing new people to the family. Especially all the kind of girls you drag in here. It was all delicious. Thank you so much. We're really happy with our chef. - Was the pizza good, Kalle? - Yeah, very. Good afternoon. Welcome. A guest. We don't often have visitors. - Your name? - Lena Karlsvik, Your Highness. Sofia, please. It's always very nice to meet Margrethe's friends. Actually, I'm here with Kalle. Karl Johan? Well, that's also nice. - Sverre, can I borrow you for a moment? - Of course, my dear. Lovely to meet you, Lena. You too. Please excuse me. When I get back, we can have dessert. This is like a Pretty Woman experience for you, isn't it? You're new in town and don't know anyone. Then all of a sudden, you meet the crown prince himself. Now you're eating dinner with the King. You're calling me a whore? - Your words, not mine. - Cut it out. I'm watching out for us. No one asked you to butt in. But I have to. No one else is going to change your diapers. What's your problem, man? - Can't you be nice for ten seconds? - Like you? Do you want me to start bringing random girls into the palace? I beg your pardon? Are you seriously asking me to excuse myself? I'll correct my manners as soon as you put the napkin where it's meant to be, instead of wherever you feel like as if you're a fucking hobo. I'm back! Now, it's time for dessert. Who's ready for some? I've lost my appetite. Thank you for dinner. - None for me. - Thanks, but I'm set. Oh, that's right. You brought some candy. Do you want some? Candy? Thank you, but I think I'm fine. I'll just stick to my caramel pudding. Wait, hold on. Hang on, hang on. What do you have in there? - Uh, a bit of everything. - Let's have a look. Oh, Powertoads. Can I take one? Mm-hm. Go ahead. And a Heksehyl. Haven't had those in forever. Can I take that too? Yeah. - Whatever you want. - Thank you. You're welcome. King. Call me Sverre, please. I wouldn't dare. But you can call me Lena. I admire you, Lena. - Hi, Lena. - Hi. - Hello. - Hey. We're about to eat. - Where's Theodor? - Upstairs. Sleeping. - Hope you're hungry. - I actually ate already. Oh, really? Where? At the palace. At the palace? Yep. And with whom? With Kalle, Margrethe, and Sverre. Sverre, the King? Yeah, the King. I'll get him. The King had Heksehyl for dessert. - I'll see you in class later. - I'll have my notes this time. Are you going? Everyone's going, Lena. It's more mandatory than the vaccine. You free this weekend? I have nothing planned. Good. 'Cause we're gonna be taking a trip. To Arnie's cabin. The only way I'm coming is if we get our own room that locks, so we aren't disturbed. Just for the two of us. I'll see what I can do. Kalle, what's up with your mom? She's just sick. She's terrified of not being good enough. But it's just a type of anxiety. Do you think she will ever get better? She might. But only if she faces her fears. And actually admits she has anxiety. That she's scared of everything, everyone. - Ready for calc? - Uh, yeah. - So this weekend? - Yeah, sure. - Is she coming with? - Mm-hm. - Hi. - Hi. Can I take your bag? Sure. Thank you. No problem. Hey, it's nice to see you. Likewise, Your Royal Highness. Oh, I took the liberty of folding the crown prince's T-shirt after... After the little accident yesterday. Thank you so much. That was sweet. My pleasure. Of course. Hello, hello. I take it you're Lena's parents then? - Your Royal Highness. - Hi. And this one must be Theodor. Hi! Thank you for asking Lena to join you on your trip. - Bitch. - It's really no problem. Don't worry. All of Kalle's friends are my friends, so everything is... Is totally fine. - I hope you have a lovely weekend. - You too. Have a splendid weekend. Of course. Thank you. Okay. What's up? GURO AND KRISTIAN ARE BACK TOGETHER - Did you see it? - Who didn't? ISN'T K WITH LENA? THAT'S LAST WEEK. LENA DUMPED AGAIN LOSER Did you see this? VIDEO SUCCESFULLY POSTED Oh my God! That is disgusting. Fuck off, Lena! You look so cute when you're sleeping. - Can you delete it please? - Okay. I just don't like getting my picture taken. I thought Margrethe was the only one who cared about that, but... There. Deleted. Mm. - Shit, it's raining. - It's barely sprinkling. We're outside of Horten now. You feel like home yet? Can we stop here? I need to pee so badly. Kalle, why are you so vulgar? - I'll get a drink. Anything? - No, thanks. Okay. Lena, stop! Fuck, Lena. Come on. Hey. I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry, Guro. I shouldn't have posted that video. I was totally out of line. I don't know if there's anything I-I can say that'll fix this, but what I did was wrong. And it was shitty. And I hope you forgive me. I'm sorry. Fuck you! Fucking bitch! Fuck you, Lena. It's way too fucking late. Too fucking late! Excuse me. What's going on here? Hey. Is everyone doing okay? Lena? Yeah, it's fine. Are you sure? Yes, it's fine. I was trying to find the women's restroom. I was told it was around the corner. Where? It's on the other side. Your Majesty. Thank you. There's a really long line at the register right now. You should handle that. Yeah. Of course. Jesus. Good to see you're real popular in Horten then. I apologize. It was old shit. I promise I won't say anything to Kalle. You can relax. It'll stay between us. But feel free to tell me what that was all about someday, when you're ready. Thank you so much. What's her name? Guro. Guro enjoys violence? I guess she does. Wipe that dirt off, please, before Kalle sees you, okay? Fuck. - Hm, where have you been? - In the bathroom. What's that smell? - My coffee. - Wow, so mature. Hm. One of us has to be. Let's go check our bedroom. Come. You swim like a fish. That's what I was trying to tell you when you nearly drowned me in that pool. That's what you were trying to tell me? I was a little focused on the screaming. What's wrong? You okay? Do you think I'm ugly? Why would you say that? You won't even touch me. Lena, I think you're gorgeous. I mean it. It-It's just that I'm freaking out, because I'm scared I might... I might end up getting you pregnant. This has nothing to do with how attractive you are. It's all about me. It's not you, it's me. Let's go. - She was like, "Whoa, wait!" - That's exactly what she did! That's so disgusting. How can you even be joking about this? You're all so nasty. It's not that bad! Okay, so why don't we... Yeah, let's do this instead. Um... Yeah, okay. On a scale of one to ten, how hot do you think our teacher, Ove, is? Ooh. - I think three. - Three? - Serious? Come on. - Whoa. At least a five. Yes, at least five. What? Kinda. Personally, I think he's an easy seven. Seven? Absolutely no way. That's gross That's so gross. Sense of humor gives him extra points, ladies. There is absolutely nothing sexy about our teacher, Ove. - But those eyes... - Yeah! - And that smile. - Yes! Kalle, what about you? - He's so funny. That's sexy. - Uh... Nine, if you're asking me. Oh! He's a great guy. Why wouldn't you give him a nine? You're crazy if you don't like him. I'm talking about all of you. Ove would be perfect for Tess, don't you think? - Gross! - What? No, no, no! I mean she could style him. Not like that. No, no. Why did you decide to go there? Don't be so dirty. - Tess is probably too busy. - What, really? No, I mean, she's got a lot going on with TikTok and that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah. And YouTube. Didn't she sign some deal? A few days ago? - YouTube too? - Yeah. What an internet whore. No! Come on. I don't get it. Why do you all hate her so much? I mean, what's the deal? How come you don't like her? Well, she makes a living selling gossip online. I thought she just had a makeup blog. Yeah, but do you know how she got all those followers? By being herself. People like that. What's wrong is that she was making money off of us. You know, featuring the royals. When she started posting on TikTok, her first ever video had us in the background. Wow. Last year, when Kalle's picture went viral, that was... Tess. But how do you know that? I mean, it's obvious. She's betrayed us. Hm. We can't have any more traitors in our group, you see now? Hm. Well, it was very nice to be invited at least. - So thank you. - We're happy you're here, rookie. - Yeah. - Maybe it's time to give a... A proper toast? Cabin Champagne! Cabin Champagne! Cabin Cham... - Come on, man. - Get your glasses! Get your glasses! Watch out, you're spilling. That's crazy! Yes. - Cabin Champagne! Cabin Champagne! - Okay, okay. Cabin Champagne! Cabin Champagne! You need to have some, Margrethe. Yes. Yeah? Congrats on becoming an official cabin trip member. Welcome to the group! Cheers! Yeah! Cheers!

Can't we just lie here together? Then what is it? Is it me? We talked about this. That stuff stresses me out. It won't happen if we use a condom. Kalle... You have no idea how much pressure I feel when people call me Prince Fuckboy or when they spread these rumors. People assume that's my life, but that's just not how things are really. - How are things really? - They're not what people think. I don't care what anyone else thinks about you. It's not a big deal if it doesn't work immediately. This happens sometimes. I don't need any pity. Okay? Okay. Why won't you just tell me? What? I've already told you. This has nothing to do with you. No. Why won't you just say you've never done it before? Because it's humiliating for me. You have nothing to worry about. I know now, and I don't care if you did or not. I just want to be with you. Understand? Yeah. I'm starting to realize that. Guys, there's... Oh! Wow, uh, wow. I guess I really should have knocked, huh? You could have at least warned me. Fuck. Um, there's now brunch upstairs, so... And we've got visitors, so while this seems like fun, maybe you could say hello? When you guys are done with whatever you two might be doing. Um... So I'm just gonna leave you two to keep at it. Not that you're doing anything. But if you are, um... Use a condom, Kalle! It's super fucking... He is such an asshole. Have you tried talking to him about it? No, I couldn't bear that. Should I? - Yes! - He's an idiot. He wouldn't understand. That's true. Hm. Uh, I forgot something back at the cabin. I need to go grab it real quick. Is it okay if I come find you later? Okay, yeah. YOU ARE LOVELY I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. LENA Going so soon? I thought you liked being the center of attention? Look, I'm leaving. I give up, okay? Are you gonna beat the shit out of me again? You give up? If you were going to give up, you would have done it a while ago, Lena. I've already said that I'm sorry and that I regret doing it. What more do you want from me? You're just as guilty as I am. Can you at least tell me this? How could you fucking sleep with Kristian? Seriously? You shut us out, Guro, so we ended up turning to each other, all right? I was in love with him first. You literally made out with him once, then he chose me. - Yeah, but he dumped you. - That's because you outed me. You had cheated on him. But you filmed that shit. Shared it to the whole world. Posted it online for everyone I know to see. I did. Sorry. It's called a mistake. You're a terrible person. - I'm not doing this now. - And what about the prince? What about him? Wouldn't he want to know who he's hanging out with? Doesn't he depend on having people around him he can trust? What's he gonna say? Probably what everyone else already said about me. That I'm a bitch. But I'm used to that now, so go tell him whatever you want. I don't give a fuck. Safe travels, bitch. And stop sending me creepy messages. It's obvious it's you, you fucking dumbass. FROM: KALLE WHERE ARE YOU? FROM: FANNY WAITING FOR YOU! SOMETHING UP? SHOULD I COME DOWN TO THE CABIN? FROM: KALLE WHAT'S UP?? Hey, you can't be walking out here. I mean, you're in the middle of the road. People are trying to drive here. Are you free right now? Yeah, I'm free, all right. Can you take me to Oslo? It won't be cheap. That's fine. FROM: MOM. EVERYTHING GOOD, SWEET LENA? IS THE CABIN NICE? TO: MOM. CAN YOU TRANSFER 1000 KRONER? EXPLAIN LATER FROM MOM: WE'RE DOING FINE! WE'RE OUT CAMPING. FROM: MOM TO: MOM: ALL GOOD HERE! TJØME IS LOVELY TO: KALLE: HAD TO GO HOME. MADE IT TO THE BUS. EXPLAIN LATER. TO: TESS: HOME IN 20? COULD YOU HELP ME WITH SOMETHING? NOK 3850 - Hello! - Hey. Thanks so much. Hi! - Hi. - Here. - Thanks, sir. - No problem. Thank you. My pleasure. Is there something wrong between you and Kalle? Uh, yeah, you could say that. Do you wanna talk about it? - Um, not really. - Okay. - Thank you so much. Seriously. - Oh, girl, no worries. I'll pay you back. I promise. It's okay. So this is my house. Here you two are. Nice. They look pretty good, right? They're homemade pancakes with some organic bananas, some melons, and also there's your choice of tea. What would you like? We have oolong? Black? I'll take an oolong, please. - Yeah. - Can I just have the same as Tess? We also have white. - Um, that's fine. - Okay. Actually, I'll take black, please. Okay, no problem. Good then. It'll be just three minutes for your black, and five for oolong. That's really very, very important. Of course. I'll make sure we time it. Thank you. I'll leave you ladies to it then. - Please enjoy. - Thanks. Thank you so much. - You can jump right in. - Mm. - Should I eat this with my hands? - Yeah, go for it. So how does it feel to be a part of the inner circle? I've never really been the kind to be in an inner circle. I don't know if I was ever really a part of all that. Anyways, I'm not now. I run a serious fashion blog, so the last thing I'm interested in is posting pictures of some idiot rolling around with half-naked women. However, Princess Paranoia refuses to actually see it. Aren't you sick of that? Yeah, it was pretty shitty at first, but now it's almost like a good thing. Because I realized that it's when you don't fit into a group that you start finding yourself as an individual, without distractions. I mean, you get to find out who you are, as a person, on your own. Can you smile for me? Thanks. It was scary to do it, but also, it was pretty freeing, because you stop giving a fuck about other people's opinions. I knew it, girl. It's just so easy to make you look really hot. FROM: ARNIE: HI LENA! SUCKS THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE. DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT BE GOOD TO HIM. NEVER SEEN THE BOY LIKE THAT BEFORE. TO: KALLE: I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU, AND I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE TOMORROW AT 5 P.M. Ah, Grandiosa pizza slices. So chic. My brother would've liked that. It's really a shame he won't ever get to see this. Tealights as well? Oh my God, cute. Why are you here? I came here to tell you to stay away from Kalle. What? It's been really great getting to know your old friends from Horten. And especially Guro from the gas station. She had quite a lot to say. Apparently, it turns out that the biggest liar, the biggest blabbermouth, and undeniably the biggest asshole... was you, dear. I know I made a mistake, okay? A big one. - I swear I'm trying to fix it. - But that's not enough. My family doesn't need people who actually have experience in spreading lies on the Internet. And also who are so cruel that they don't give a shit about the consequences. Listen, I have been an idiot. But if you think I'm gonna back out just because you command it, you're wrong. You can play the princess card all you want. I don't listen to fucking bitches who think they're special because they have a silver spoon up their ass. How old is your son now? Two? Almost two? And how old were you when you had him? Sixteen? Impressive. I'd say crazy impressive, actually. You're quiet now. Did I hit a nerve? You can relax. I've only talked to Guro. Kalle knows nothing. It's probably best that he doesn't know... everything. I don't want to make any trouble, Lena. That's not what I want at all. But my family can't handle this. And you should know that the Queen, she's very ill right now. And if we have to worry about some unstable teenage mother on top of everything else, we are going to collapse. And that is why I want you to stay far, far away from Kalle. And if not, I'll tell everyone, absolutely everyone, that you don't have a little brother, but you have a son. And it won't be pretty. Hi. What's wrong? - Did you lose your phone or what? - No. I went to the park, but I couldn't find you. Why didn't you answer me? I was worried sick about you. Just forget it. It was stupid. Screw it. - Screw what? - Us. Let go. I can't do this anymore. Move on. Do you even hear how crazy you sound? I don't get why you're not understanding. We're finished. Why don't you just say it? It's 'cause I wouldn't sleep with you. You're actually right. I wanted to be with Prince Fuckboy. A guy I could fuck. Not a little boy with mommy issues, who can't get it hard. Fuck that. - The containers aren't big enough. - You have five minutes until dinner. - This needs to be solved. - Pizzas are in the oven. Any way we can get a crew in there? Sweetie? Hey, Lena. Hey, sweetie. Why are you crying? What is going on? Hey. It's okay. It's over. Oh, honey. I'm sorry. It's going to be okay. No, no. I'm finished. I'm done. I'm so over with pretending that I actually live a normal life. What did you think was gonna happen? That I'd just slip right into a brand-new class, and somehow make friends while hiding that I have a son? And then there's this fucking move. Are you kidding me? Lena, remember, your mom had to change jobs to take care of Theodor so that you could live a normal life. We didn't move just because of you, Lena. Your dad got a new job too and I wanted a change of pace. You're both a mother and teenager. You need to accept that and be yourself. Don't you fucking understand anything?! it doesn't work. Get it? I can't be who I am anymore, and I also can't be who I was. I've tried. Tried having friends, going to parties, even having a boyfriend, the fucking crown prince, but it's not working. It's not working. It's never gonna be okay again. If Kristian stayed and took responsibility of Theodor when he was born, we could have stayed in Horten, we would have still supported you. We are not trying to force you to be someone you're not, Lena. We just want you to have the time and space to figure that out on your own. I remember after you posted those pictures how many people turned against you. You didn't even dare to leave the house. I just... I hate my life. - I hate it! - Oh, no. Come here. Come here. Honey, you're gonna be fine. Everything is going to be okay, Huh? Come on. It'll be okay. Why don't you guys start eating and I'll go check on Theodor? Mom, I'll get him! Mom? Mom?! Dad! Karlsvik? - I'm Christine Sand. - Chief physician. She's going to be just fine. What I suspect happened is that a blood clot started to block one of her coronary arteries. That's why she wasn't getting enough oxygen. Normally, with cases like that, it can lead to a heart attack, but we were able to perform an emergency PCI, and we were successful. She'll make a full recovery. But we'd like her to stay for observation for a few days. Thank you, doctor. Can we see her now? Yes, of course. Be aware, she's under some medication and is resting. Are you gonna be okay, Dad? Yeah, it's just that... I know it'll be fine, but it's just so strange to me. I mean, to see her like this. Before meeting your mom, I was having a pretty tough time. I was feeling alone in the world. Then, she came with her smiling face. It was just like coming home. Hey. Hi. This is Theodor. He's my son. He is 14 months old and is the world's sweetest kid. I never told anyone about him because... Because I was ashamed. I want to say I'm sorry to everyone I lied to. There were so many of you. And I am so very sorry. Every one of you has the right to be angry with me. So I get it if you never want to see my face again. I will never be ashamed of you again. Never. Whoa! Woop! Woo! Ooh. Oh, do you not like that? Oh, it's okay. Look, look. Look. Look. Wow. Nice? That was a meal fit for a king, Lena. - You did a great job. - Mm. So I happened to see that video you posted on Instagram. Your classmates left you some very lovely messages. They seem very supportive. Better than expected. Yeah. And I've forgiven Kristian. - Really? - Yeah, I was thinking. It's not only the girls who get knocked up. But girls just happen to know how to handle themselves when it happens. Like, if you just start seeing someone and suddenly, they tell you you're gonna be a father, you're allowed to freak out just a little. Yeah, but there's something called taking it like a man, you know. And how would you react if I told you that we were having a kid at 16 together? But we met when we were 25, honey. That's true. But you lost it when I told you I was pregnant with Lena. We were only dating for three months when you got pregnant. That's true too. But it's also true that you immediately hopped on a boat and fled across the Pacific. - You really did that? - I turned back around. Yeah, but my point is, if Kristian wants, um, he is welcome to be a part of Theodor's life, when he's actually ready. I'm not mad anymore. That's very mature, Lena. What's up? Uh, just some people from class texting about prom. I'm not going though. I'm gonna stay here. - I'll mute it. - Hold on, let me see. Give it! What does it say here? "Where do you live?" "Shall we pick you up?" "Hey, come to prom with or without your baby." Oh! "Anyone know where Lena is?" - Hm? - I'll get it. A kid? Why didn't you say anything about a kid? Sorry. Unbelievable. Uh, why aren't you dressed? Um, well, I wasn't going to go. Shouldn't you already be there? Yeah, but I've been running around town trying to find out where you live. You not answering my texts wasn't helpful. Besides, the cool people are always a little late. Hey, hi. - Hi! - Welcome to our home. - Thank you! - I'm Lise and this is Bjørn. I'm Tess. Thanks for having me. It's lovely to finally meet you. I've seen your Instagram. Mom, no, stop! I think Lena still has time to get ready for the prom. Right? No way. Not at all. I mean, I have nothing to wear. You don't have any ball gowns just lying around? - Let me see. - Mm-mm. I have one dress that could work maybe. It's practically new. I've only worn it once. I need 20 minutes and my sewing machine. Over here! Wow, Lena. Wow. - You look great! - Thanks. Lena, I can't believe you came. It's great to see you. Why the hell would you think we didn't like kids? We all love kids! What's not to love? Uh, changing diapers and cleaning vomit isn't great. - I guess that must really suck. - Yeah. We're all looking forward to meeting your kid, sweetie. His name's Theodor. How's your mom doing? I heard she was sick. Yeah, she's doing good. Thanks for asking. - Yeah. - Everyone looks amazing. I can't believe it. Woo! Okay, everyone, if you could find your way back to your seats we can get started. It's great you came, Lena. You look really cute. Now that the truth about your kid is out, I promise I will keep my mouth shut about how much of a blabbering bitch you are, just as long as you stay away from my brother. Please give the band a round of applause! Good evening, everyone. Tonight, I will be your main host, and I have the great honor of welcoming you all to this year's prom. First of all, let's make sure you all know where the emergency exits are. Hopefully you won't need to use them. Where is Kalle? Better safe than sorry. I have no idea, girl. There are two located at each end of the room and two on each of the sides, uh, here, and over there. Okay, so before we can dive into your dinner and the festivities of the evening, I want to introduce a pretty special person who has asked for a moment of your time. He is not only your fellow student, but the next King of Norway, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Karl Johan! Kalle! Kalle! Kalle! Kalle! Kalle! Kalle! Thank you so much, Ove. Hello, everyone. You all look great tonight. As many of you know, I'm not a very talented musician. That's right! Thanks, Gunnar. But I would like to play a song for you guys anyway. Woo! ♪ Stop dreaming about that sweet life ♪ ♪ We'll never be a part of it ♪ ♪ Never apologize For the things you never did ♪ ♪ But it eats you up When you're lying in your bed ♪ ♪ Oh God, it hurts so much When something so close is so far away ♪ ♪ Oh, come on, Lena ♪ ♪ What else should we do? ♪ ♪ Oh, come on, Lena ♪ ♪ Come on, Lena ♪ So Theodor is actually...? I'm sorry that I lied to you. No more surprises from now on? Do you forgive me? I do.
