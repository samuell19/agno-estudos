[***] NARRATOR: In this city, you're nothin' unless you're part of something better than yourself. I joined a gang when I was 10 years old. I loved being a gangsta. I loved my barrio. Maybe that's why I became a cop. With that power came responsibility. With responsibility came opportunity. And with opportunity came corruption. It was like the plague. Everybody got sick. [***] Hey, hold up, Salim. Chill out. There's somebody comin'. There's nothin' to see out here, sir. Go back inside. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Salim, kick back, homey. S-- Salim. You want a gun in your hand and a bullet in your head too? Oh, you don't fuckin' hear me? I'm-a shoot you in your motherfuckin' face! I'll hit you in your motherfuckin' head! Salim, damn it. Salim! [***] [SIRENS WAILING] Undercover. Undercover. POLICE: Put your hands up in the air. Undercover. Undercov-- [***] NARRATOR: I didn't give a fuck about killing two gangsters. That was our mission. They were our quota. Those were our orders. I believed in what I did. I believed in protecting the people from the dirt on the streets. I believed there was a difference between us and them. But man or animal... there are some lines we should not cross. And my partner killed an innocent man. Still... ...I never thought I'd be a rat. I love my partner like a brother. And I love my unit like my own family. But after that night, I had changed. [HORN HONKS] I didn't have a choice. My conscience was takin' care of that. I know. I know it's a clichÃ©, but... they taste so good-- Do you want one? Why the hell you rollin' up on me at my crib? I think it's best we talk in person, so hop in. We need something else. We need your partner to corroborate your testimony. Nah, he ain't gonna roll. We need you to talk to him. Look, I'll take a poly, I'll do whatever it takes. Won't fly in court. You know that. And one more finger-pointin' rat will. Some finger-pointin'... a little name-calling... should do the trick. There some reason you don't want him comin' in with ya? He knows what you're doin'... maybe he'll change his mind. [STARTS ENGINE] Today's the day. [STARTS ENGINE] Guys like me are what we always were... [***] Expendable. [MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH] WOMAN: Elijah, did you clean your room this morning? No. Go clean it. Okay. All right. Thank you. Girl [ON TV]: Feed us. We're starving.

Ho says, "Well, all of them, "they all done paid in quarters. One at a time." [LAUGHS] Just wanna make it through this day. That's all I wanna do. I just wanna stick my dick in somethin'. Stick your dick in somethin'? You'd fuck a dog if you had the chance. That's not very nice. [CHUCKLES] Ooh, what's up, ladies? You ever have a black and blue? You're a pig. Get out of here. SALIM: Ah, don't be mad. [TIRES SCREECH] We can make it, baby! She just ran that light. [ARMANDO LAUGHS] Crazy-ass bitch. I should've gave that bitch a ticket. Nasty-ass, trick-ass bitch.

You don't need that shit. Stay still, motherfucker. The fuck is this? What you got in there? You don't need that shit. Don't move until I say "move." Yes, sir. Don't "yes, sir" me, motherfucker. Just stay still. Look at this. Mmm! All the bells and whistles. Put your hands on the ceiling. Put your hands on the ceiling! What is that, seat warmers? You got 'em too in there?

After you. Thank you, baby. Before we get going... Officer Wallace has something to share. Tell your fellow officers about your experience yesterday. Yes, sir. I was, uh, approaching a somewhat hostile crowd... [GUNSHOT] ...surrounding a drive-by shooting victim. [WOMAN SOBBING] I noticed that the victim, some gangbanger known as Little Angel, had his brains falling out of the back of his head. WOMAN: Where were you guys? What do we pay you for? And the mother was trying to put the brains back in. But the more she tried... the more they kept falling out. It was like spaghetti or something. Then she said, "No wonder people kill cops." Nobody in this room feels worse for her than, uh... Officer Wallace. Is that right? Yes, sir. But that isn't why people kill cops, is it, Wallace? No, sir. Why do people kill cops? Sir, because they see us as the enemy. Because they distrust us. CAPTAIN: No. It's because those people... are not people at all. What's the difference between us and them, Wallace? I don't know Think about it. Officer Sancho? Sir. What do we do here? Sir, we fight fire with fire. There's a war out there on the streets. And the blood on that poor mother's hands... is blood on all of our hands. Now, you go out there today and knock heads with the enemy. Make sure... the letters P-O-L-I-C-E is branded on the head of every gangbanger like a cowboy's branding iron. Remember, you are the elite. The chosen few. One felon a day is all you need to do. Dismissed. MAN: Let's roll. Fellas. SALIM: That's a sweet little story you told there...rookie. Shut up, nigga. You know what I'm sayin'? You serious? Watch my baton, nigga. Come on. Who the fuck you pushin,' bitch? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a rookie, don't forget that shit, motherfucker. Why you messin' with him, anyway? Tryin' to heat the young kids up. Know what I mean? No... Bye, Salim. Lieutenant, give us a minute, will ya? Sure. Thanks. [***] [CLACKING] So... today is the day. I can't tell you how much faith I have in you two. Thank you, sir. You know how these things go. Somebody on the outside thinks they can do our job better than we do. [SCOFFS] They get upset because we play ball. But as long as crime keeps going down... all we gotta do is ride it out. And ride it out is what we're gonna do. You can count on us, sir. Good. You okay, Armando? A little nervous, sir. Look, I know only the best intentions were behind what happened that day. Mistakes happen in the fog of war. You're a good man. But the world is a bad place. You do the best you can in a bad place. Remember that. Yes, sir. Last week... more third-strikers were put away by us than any other division in the city. Be proud. Walk tall. I'll take care of ya. Don't worry. Yes, sir. A man said... "Someday a real rain's gonna come and wash all the scum off the street." Only it don't rain in the desert. So we gotta do all the scum-washin' ourselves. Nigga better get a life vest. A little hair of the dog? I'm a drunk. I'm always thirsty. See you in a second. Cool. Right. [DIALING] [LINE RINGING] MAN [IN JAMAICAN ACCENT ON PHONE]: Yeah.

You know the drill. Come on. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] SALIM: Yo, are we supposed to be wearin' a wire? Bet this reminds you of Valentine's Day, when your father would beat you and then make love to you. Quit your bitchin', pussy. SALIM: Fuck you, man. [MAN LAUGHS] You got a problem with it? Talk to the man. Come on. They want more ice. What time you guys meetin' IA? 1800. What did the captain tell you? He said to stay away from corrupt motherfuckers like you. You got your stories straight? We in the loop. Don't worry about us. We know what's happenin'. Know what I mean? So, what do you got planned for the rest of the day? Same ol', same ol'. You got a little time for a little ring-a-ding then, huh? Fo' sho'. Nah. I don't think so. [***] Do you know the definition of "opportunity"? No? "Opportunity: a favorable juncture of circumstances." Or let's see... Another one would be... Uh, if you like, "a good chance for advancement of progress." You understand that? Opportunity. [PHONE RINGS] Advancement of fucking progress. [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] [FOOTSTEPS] MAN: Lieutenant. Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah. [***] All right, good. Perfect. "I don't think so," motherfucker? Embarrass me in front of the lieutenant like that? Hey, don't think for us. What you doin' here?

That's what I'm talkin' about. [GLASSES CLINK] Cheers. Salud. Now, here's the deal: There's a guy named Brax, who's been reaching out to us. I know Brax. It's, uh... Damian Baine's right-hand man. SALIM: Nigga owns every nightclub in town. Well, he's got some scam, and he's in a real hurry to get it done. I mean, quick. You guys cool with that? SALIM: Cool. I can set up a meeting between you guys and him at this Mexican joint. All right? Now...there's... 13 keys of the most pure shit you ever seen in your life sitting downtown in Evidence, with your names written all over it. We get these 13 keys to Baine, who's responsible for getting it back? [CHUCKLES] Who the fuck do you think? I almost forgot. Shit. I got you guys... courtside seats to the playoffs tonight. SALIM: What? So make it quick at IA. You understand? You guys are gonna have some fun today. That's what's up. You know what I mean? You guys enjoy the game tonight. Mm. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... Nigga, I never been courtside to the playoffs before. What? I ain't never even been to the playoffs before. Shit. Hoo-hoo! Why would that cheap motherfucker give us free tickets to the playoffs? I don't know. But it says something that he's coming to us and not that motherfuckin' wetback. Know what I mean? It's just a fuckin' game, man. That's all it is. Hey, don't stick your dick in the gift horse's mouth. All right? It means somethin'. Ya heard me? Yes, sir. Today's the day, my nigga. We on the come up. We comin' up! [BARKS] I don't like it, Salim. Take a leg up when you get it. Shit. Why in the hell would anybody wanna give us a leg up? Tryin' to show trust in us. Shit. [SCOFFS] "Trust in us." Hey, man, we get in with Baine, we get rich. Hear me? Pretty quick to get on that Baine program, ain't ya? Don't hate the player. Hate the game, cuz. You know the deal. MAN: You're Officer Sancho? Do I look Mexican? It's my partner.

So give me a minute while I call the requesting judge, okay? Uh, sir? Sir. Listen, we're late, our job's on the line... We really need to get going. You wouldn't want another drug dealer on the street if we're fuckin' late, would you? [BUZZING] Woo-hoo! Motherfuckin' candy store. Toxicology was here earlier. Ran a test sample. So no funny stuff. SALIM: No funny stuff. You. Sign that. Had more than a few pieces of evidence disappear after being checked out by your division officers. Zip that up. This gets back by 5. [STAMPING DOCUMENT] I'll take that. Follow procedure, officers. Five o'clock. So, what the fuck was that shit about back there? What? The name on the slip, that's what. What name you want on it? How about your own name? Why mine, bitch? Well, it's your fucking gig, ain't it? Oh, no, fuck that. We partners, man. We in this together. As always. What, you got something to say? Say it. Fuck it.

Good. Let's go punk down the motherfucker. [***] Thank you for coming in again, captain. We appreciate your time. Whatever I can do to help. Good. Ready, gentlemen? Ready. You testified that the two young men killed by your officers were both gang members? Yes. And the older man who was shot by your officers outside the bar, you said he was intoxicated and confrontational. He reached into his pocket for what my officers thought was a gun. The safety of my men is my first priority. I thought your first priority was to serve and protect. My men are soldiers. Soldiers kill people, captain. Cops help people. Until Officers Sancho and Adel were hired by me, the only light they saw was the flash from the barrel of a gun. Now, if you want to politicize this event and ruin their lives-- The only lives we're concerned with are the families of the men who lost their lives that night. And that's why you'll never understand what it means to be a cop. This ain't Bay Street. What they doin' at the beach? Fuckin' dirty-ass hippies freak me out, man. Lookin' for somebody stupid enough to walk up to a door with a bag full of shit and say, "Nantucket." Thought that was gonna be me. Hey, if this is a fuckin' setup, we not the ones gettin' shot in the back of the head. We're gonna go in, make this jack move happen. Who's the ruthless-ass motherfucker? I like it. [***] Okay. You ready? Aah! Okay. GIRL: Now, see? Yeah. I have to be good. [LAUGHS] Good. Yeah, I'm good. You lookin' good. You might take me out. See? Dude. Dude, what are you look--?

Go get her crackin', man. What? You don't like what you see or somethin'? I ain't about to kiss you in front of your boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend, okay? Excuse me. Shit, I can kiss whoever the fuck I want. [SIGHS] And maybe I wanna kiss you. BOY: Oh, is that right? [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] BOY 2: Hey, police! Police! GIRL: Shit! SALIM: Hey, don't run! Don't run! Hey, now. ARMANDO: Don't run, you little motherfuckers. I said stop, you little bitch. Come on. SALIM: Don't make it hard on yourself. [ALL YELLING] What, you forgot the rules now? You're not supposed to fuck with the man. Shut-- Motherfucker! Huh? What happens when you run? Huh? What's the fuckin' rule? You get a beatdown. That's right. You tryin' to get a beatdown? Why you runnin', anyway? What, you got somethin' to hide? We run because you two motherfuckers is too violent. We run because you shoot me, and you put a gun in my hand. Shut the fuck up. Did I ask you? Hey, leave him the fuck alone, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I just caught somethin' now. What we got here, lovebirds? [BOYS LAUGHING] Nice friends you got there. Yeah, well... at least we ain't a bunch of pigs, right? [SPITS] Who the fuck you spittin' at, motherfucker? Huh? Who the fuck you spittin' at? Salim. Stay still, bitch. SALIM: Stay the fuck still. Salim, let her go. Come on, let's go. Fuckin' spit on me. Hey. I'm guessin' white cotton panties. I bet you I can get you wet in front of your boyfriend. I bet you she's a cueball. Nice and tasty too, huh? Come on, Salim, let's get outta here. N-n-nigga, just hold up. Hold up. I just wanna make sure she ain't hidin' nothin' underneath here. No worry, Rita, he can't touch you. Rita? Is that your name, huh? Is that your name? All right, well, Rita, just think of this as a visit to the gynecologist. [WHIMPERING] What did I say? Score one for the niggas in blue, huh? White cotton undies. Yeah, man. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hang on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I forgot. Are you cue balled or not? Let's see up here... No. No, please! Please! Yep.

[CLICKS ON RECORDER] Violence is a language that people understand. And sometimes, when it's necessary... When it's necessary... Oh, it sounds beautiful. These convictions you hold are far more dangerous to the truth than to lies. You're knee-deep in a pile of shit. We're all knee-deep in a pile of shit. And it doesn't matter how high up you think you are. It doesn't matter if you can smell it yet. It's the same pile of shit we're all sinkin' in. Don't let morality make you stupid. SALIM: "Splooge." What kind of a name is that for a nigga? That's the sound my dick makes when it's slippin' into your girlfriend. Maybe you should lay off the shit a little, Officer Salim.

I've already sent troops over to Salim's house, and I'll make a personal visit over to Sancho's and see what I can do. All right? What did you say to Internal Affairs? [CHUCKLES] Did you honestly think that I was gonna take the fall? I'm just lookin' out for number one, captain. And you are on a short leash. So you'd better keep me close. They're always watchin'.

You called it in? Yeah. When you was chasin' Splooge. [WHISPERS] Shut the fuck up. Shh. Don't say nothin'. Salim! [YELLS] [GROANING] [GUN COCKS] Easy, motherfucker! Drop the piece and turn the fuck around! Drop the fuckin' piece! [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] No, we're a long way from fuckin' brothers, bitch. Turn the fuck around and drop your fuckin' piece! Drop it!

You like that? Fuck, get your ass in there, motherfucker! Ooh-hoo-hoo! You got that nigger, cuz! Your partner's on the floor bleedin' like a stuck pig, and you think this shit is funny? You better start talkin', motherfucker. Who sent y'all to fuck us up?! They knew you were gonna rat, man. What the fuck do you think? They thought I was gonna rat? Who the fuck is "they"? Who the fuck is "they," motherfucker? Oh, you think this is a joke. I ought to put this motherfucker in your fuckin' eye, blow your head off. Say something, motherfucker! We can still get out of this, man. Who set us up, motherfucker? Lieutenant, man. Who the fuck you think? Lieutenant sent us here, lieutenant sent you to Baine. Well, what the fuck the drugs for? Payment for your murder. Till Baine fucked up. He was supposed to take you out at the taco stand, make it look like a gang hit. You lyin' to me, motherfucker? I'll put one through your motherfuckin'-- I'm not fuckin' lying! How did he know we was gonna take the job? You heard him! How did he know we gonna take the job?

We can still do some good. [GROANING] I will fucking kill you! [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] Don't run. Shhh. [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOT] [GUN COCKS] We done good here. SALIM: Hey, hey. Hey. Fuck that shit, cuz. And you know I'm drivin'. Woo-hoo. Shit. It's on. [***] You got your watch, you got your rims. How does it feel? It feels good, motherfucker. What the fuck do you want me to say, "I'm sorry"? All right, maybe you right. Maybe we go to IA, come clean, tell 'em everything. Fuck it. Now you wanna come clean. Who we gonna say killed Rodriguez and Sayed, huh? Gangbangers. Gangbangers. Word up. Oh, you think they're gonna believe a bean and a nigger that just stole 13 keys and killed two cops? All they care about is what we tell 'em about the lieutenant. About the robberies and dealings, and the drugs and shit. We go together. Tell 'em everything. Let me ask you something, cuz. How the fuck could they think we'd rat? As fucked up as I am, I could teach you a thing or two about loyalty. Fuckin' city. I never could make sense of it. I know what I gotta do. I don't expect you to come with. What you say go, remember? [HARD RAP PLAYING] [GUN COCKS] [MAN RAPPING IN SPANISH] [***] [IN SPANISH] [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [CHUCKLES] I was loyal, carnal. Siempre. Loyal to who is the question. None of that pinche mierda would've happened if you would've told me he was protectin' H.A. now. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] I'm a businessman. And when it comes to green, I'm fucking colorblind. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] And I don't need your fucking permission or approval... on how I conduct my business... officer. [IN SPANISH] I don't know. I swear on my Evita's life. I don't fuckin' know. We'll see. Your shoeshine boy, he knows where the money is? [SNAPS] Hey. Have you ever seen what someone looks like with no skin? You see what a man is. I mean, really is. Flesh and blood. It's very interesting. I enjoy it quite a lot. And I never skinned a nigger before. [KEY RATTLES IN LOCK] [CHAMBER SPINS] You have one choice. You tell me where the money is, or you have a bullet in your head. One pull of the trigger for yourself, or, as I assume you will choose to do, two pulls of the trigger for your partner. [IN SPANISH] Cuz, tell this nigga what happened. Tell him we got jacked, and we don't know where the money is. Tell him, cuz! Who wants to go first? Fine, I choose. [GUN COCKS] It doesn't have to be this way. Just tell me where the money is. One to yourself, or two to him. MAN: Shoot that bitch. MAN 2: Shoot that white bitch. MAN 3: Shoot him. Pull the fuckin' trigger, Ã©se. MAN 4: Do it, Ã©se. Salim! You want a gun in your hand and a bullet in your head too? You hear me, motherfucker? I'm-a shoot you in your motherfuckin' face! Salim! I'm just bullshittin'. Salim! SALIM: Hey! Shit! SALIM: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! [SIREN WAILS] [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] ARMANDO: Redemption is remembrance. I killed an innocent man. [CLICKS] MAN: Shit. That's gangster shit right there, homey. MAN 2: Heart. Ah, it shows integrity. Yeah. Bravery. Pero redemption does not come so easy. [CHAMBER SPINS, CLICKS] MAN: Do it, pig. MAN 2: Do it. MAN 3: Grab it, puto. MEN [CHANTING]: Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Puto! Fuck. Fuck. [CHAMBER SPINS, CLICKS] [CROWD MURMURS] [MEN CHANTING] All right. I know where the money is. I know where the money is. Stashed in a motherfuckin' alley. That the kind of family you were looking for? That the kind of family that would die for you? SALIM: Hey, let us go, man, now. I'll take you to the dough. One pull of the trigger for yourself, or two for him. That's not the deal, cuz. MAN: You got one more shot, puto. Shut the fuck up. The game is over. You kill me, you don't get the dough. That's whassup. [GUN COCKS] Look at him. Look at him! Hey, motherfucker. I want you to look at him. Look at him. You take a good fucking look at him. It's never over. [GUNSHOT] ARMANDO: There's only one kind of wisdom, and that's hindsight. Everything happens in bits, and you don't wake up until afterwards. Until it's too late. [SNIFFS] What's that smell like? ROLAND: Take him to get the money. ARMANDO: In that final moment, you wait for something, anything to take you away. And what returns, what finally comes home to you, is your own fuckin' self. Nothin' can save you from that. [TIRES SQUEAL] SALIM [CALLING]: Police! I need help! Help! I need help! ARMANDO: You can't change the color of your skin. You can't change the color of your heart. You can change the colors you wear. But deep down inside, you'll always be the same salvationless motherfucker you always were. No idea. Hey, where the fuck you been? [DOOR BUZZES] MAN [LAUGHS]: Jesus. Got the chem lab report. Big shit, cut with some heavy-duty rat poison. Fuckin' payback. Bye, bitch. [CLAPPING] CAPTAIN: It's never easy grieving over the death of a partner. Even if he went crazy and tried to kill you. The pressure of knowing he did wrong that day must have gotten to him. You had no choice. It was self-defense. After he killed Rodriguez and Sayed single-handedly. We're even more sorry about your girlfriend. I'm sorry he made it personal. Our, uh, deepest sympathies. But my son Elijah's okay, right? So according to your report, after roll call, you went on your rounds. [SOBBING] Sancho turned on you, went ballistic. You went in pursuit. You told Officer Sancho that you were gonna come clean and let IA know that he was responsible for the shooting. You understand that? Good. You showed yourself to be a real hero today. You should be proud. Oh, I, uh... I called Internal Affairs. Let 'em know you'd be a little late. I'm sorry it got so messy, Salim. Listen, you're gonna be at IA for a little while. You still have those courtside seats? ARMANDO: Nobody talks about the day of their death, like today is the day. But today was the day. [***] [***] You see things a lot more clearly when you're dead.
