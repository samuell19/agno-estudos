Finally reception. Mom. Mom, hello. Hi honey, how was the game? Yeah, we won. Oh good they won. Good, when are you coming home? No, not yet. No Mom. Well, honey what's wrong with your voice? There was this man and he. Jennifer can't come to the phone right now. Care to leave a message? Jennifer? Jennifer? Jennifer? Hey. Morning, baby. - Hold that. - Thanks. Yup. How's breakfast? Good. Yeah, good. So. You know how much I love you, right? Yeah, I know. Well, I was thinking we take our relationship to the next level. I don't know about that. Why not? Do you remember when you cheated on me with that bimbo? I thought we were past that. Tom, that was only like six months ago. I know. Listen, I'm sorry okay. I was drunk and stupid and more importantly, I didn't see what was in front of me this whole time. I know those are just excuses but I am so... Do you realize how much you hurt me? Yeah. But listen. I cannot change the past. But the future. I see us being very, very happy together. Marry me. I don't know. It's a big step. Why? Baby, I would do anything for you. Marry me. I know. I want to, Tom. I really do. But? I just I don't know. Listen, I love you okay. And I am always gonna be here for you no matter what. Forever and always. Marry me. Tom, you know how much family is important to me. You haven't even met my brothers yet or my Uncle Bob. Then we'll meet 'em. Marry me. Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. We'll have that wedding that you always talked about. Old country style. That would be nice. Well let's go. Right now? Yeah, why not? What about your job? What about it? You're far more important. Okay, let's go. Well let's go pack. Okay. Right now. - Okay. - Let's go. He's changed really. I don't know, honey. You know how men are. He's different now. You sure? Yes. You love him? With all my heart. How far are you from South Carolina? I don't know. Maybe five hours. Okay, honey. We'll get ready to meet him. I don't think any preparations are necessary. It's always better to be prepared. But Uncle Bob... Alice, you know the rules? Fine. I gotta go. Bye. Got it? Make sure you locked up. Say what? I said make sure you locked up. Hey, can you get my bag? Of course. Thank you. - All right, you excited? - So excited. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. Will you type that in? I will. Let's see. Navigation. So cute. I try. Okay. Boom. South Carolina here we come. So, tell me about your family. My family. Well I have some brothers. And I have a very close relationship with them. Well, what do I need to expect? You should expect that they're very protective, but you'll have a blast with them. Yeah. It'll be fun. Oh cool, I'm excited. And then you'll get to meet my Uncle Bob. Uncle Bob. The infamous Uncle Bob. Yes. And Uncle Bob is. Alice, you know the rules. All right, Uncle Bob. Who are you talking to? Shit. Tom. Stupid hitcher. Hi, you okay? What were you doing in the middle of the road? Looking for prey. Tom. Nobody can help you out here. Not even God can help you. Are you crazy? Oh, choose your words wisely, sir. My knife hates being called crazy. Come on, please. What do you want, you prick? You. You don't have to do this. What do you want? You know we had this little investigative reporter show up a couple weeks back and you know what I did to him? I gutted him from here all the way up. God, please help me. Oh, there's no God here. Just me, the Watcher. That's what I do. Oh there's no need looking around. People rarely travel down this road. We're sorry. Oh there's nothing to be sorry about. You and your friend have given me much joy tonight. Please don't kill us. Oh, I'm not gonna kill you. Look at this road. You know some say that this road is cursed. Some say people say there's ghosts. But you know what? It's just little old me watching. Stop it. Oh. Stop. My pleasure, baby. Bro, go back. What do you mean go back? I mean, I think I saw something over there. I didn't see anything. No, I seen like a car accident or something. That makes two of us. Plus, there ain't nothing back there. No bro, I definitely seen something, bro. What are you doing? You know what? Get out of my car. What? I said get out. Joey, stop. We can't just leave him here stranded in the middle of nowhere. Oh okay. Now you're on his side. I'm not taking sides. Maybe we didn't see anything because we were preoccupied. Okay, Jennifer. Call the police. But that's it. We don't go back. We let the pros handle this. No reception. What about you, Paul? Anything? Nothing. Yeah, nationwide coverage my ass. Wait, I think I did here something. Maybe Paul's right. We can't just leave them here stranded in the middle of nowhere with no reception. I can't go back. I get another DUI. And the coach is gonna kick me off the team for sure. Do it for me. Please. Oh my gosh. Okay. But I got a plan. Okay. I jump in the backseat. Paul, you come up front. And if, if we get pulled over, you tell the police you been driving all night. All right? Okay. What was that? I didn't hear you. Okay. All right. Fucking can't believe I'm doing this shit. Wait, what about me? Oh you know. You can come in the backseat with me or you can fucking sit shotgun next to this guy. Get in the backseat, Jennifer. Sorry. Shit. You were right. He's alive. Wake him up. Come on, man. Wake up, man. Come on. Does anyone got some water or something? Here. Hey, we're here to help you. Where's Alice? No bro, there's no Alice. Where's Alice? No, there's no Alice. Look man. You all right, man. You're probably suffering a concussion okay. Look because of the accident. Look, we can take you to the hospital. We need to find Alice. We need to find Alice. There's no one else, man. We searched. But Alice. There's nobody else. And this is your wife right here? Yeah. No. But we're engaged. Organ donor. Yeah. Alice believes in helping others. She has a beautiful heart and we need to find her. Wait we? No, there's no we, bro. There's you and then there's us, okay. We already helped you tonight, okay. We have no obligation to you know. Please. Look man, it's getting late. No, no, no, no, no, no. This Alice chick. It sounds like she's in danger. We need to do something, man. We don't need to do anything. Come on, Jen. Wait. Let's help him. For all we know this guy could be some sort of serial killer. No. Hey. Whoa, hands where I can see them, man. What the fuck you reaching for, man? Wallet. Okay. Do it very slowly. His name's Tom Hannagan. Let me see. He's a lawyer. Fantastic. Another fucking lawyer. No, I'm a public defender. I help those that can't help themselves. Call a spade a spade, bro. I hate lawyers. Put that thing down. Joey, you're scaring me. Hey look, right over there there's something. Must be where he took Alice. Okay, tell us what happened. Start from the beginning. Some guy was standing in the middle of the road. I swerved, tried to avoid him, and I wrecked. What'd he look like? Bigger. Maybe six feet. Heavy set. I don't know. I didn't get a good look at his face. He knocked me out. Do you know what the guy was wearing? Some sort of army fatigue. Did he have a weapon? Yeah, a hunting knife. You don't have any stab wounds on you. No, he hit me with the hilt of the blade. Threw me down, then kicked me. Knocked me out. And you seen him drag Alice? No, I was unconscious by that point. It doesn't make any sense. Why would he kidnap your wife but leave you alive? I don't know, man. Maybe he has some cabin in the woods. Maybe he took her there first and was planning to come back to get me. Okay. Follow us to the car, okay. We'll take you to the nearest police station. How far? The closest town is Redfield. It's about an hour away. There and back? No, that's one way. That's two hours. I don't even know how long I've been knocked out. We need to go get her. Do what you want, man, but we're going home, okay. Listen, please help. Help, she's in danger. Look man, this is the best I can do. It's not gonna kill him, but it sure as hell will slow him down. Good luck, man. Come on, Jen. We have to help him. We don't have to do anything. Look at him. He's in no shape to take on some madman by himself. If we stay, we can end up like her. What if it was me? What would you do? You know I'd save you, Jen. Come on. Then we can't leave him. It'd be the right thing to do. Shut up, man. Let me think for a second. Just think about it, man. If we find her, we can be heroes or something. It'd look good on your scholarship, man. Listen, I will give you each 10 grand if you help me. And we're just supposed to believe you on that? No. I swear, okay. Under these circumstances, life or death, no matter what happens to Alice. You'll get paid, okay. Okay. Okay. All right. What are you doing? Getting us ready. Here. Thing's real right? Bet your ass it is. You took Dad's shotgun? Hey, it came in handy for something like this. It was a good call. All right now look. Come here, Jen. Want you to do me a favor, okay. Listen. Want you to go. As soon as you find reception on your phone, you get a hold of the police. And you get the hell out of here. You understand? Now go. I love you. Be careful, okay. I love you too okay. Now go get the hell out of here. Man dude, this is a big mistake, man. Let's go. Finally reception. Mom. Mom hello. Hi honey, how was the game? Yeah, we won. Oh good they won. Good, when are you coming home? No, not yet. No Mom. Well, honey what's wrong with your voice? There was this man and he. Jennifer can't come to the phone right now. Care to leave a message? Jennifer? Jennifer? Jennifer? It looks like he stopped dragging her here. Alice. You think maybe she got away? No, I doubt it. You think maybe he decided to carry her? But the trail ends right here. We don't even know which way she could've went. Give me a second to think, all right. You guys smell that? Yeah, it smells like Alice's perfume. Just smells like perfume. This is Alice. Are you sure? Yeah, I'd recognize her stuff anywhere. Oh hey. Here. Now you guys got two real weapons. Cool thanks. What's up with this fake gun? You underestimate a BB gun, man. Point it to their face and shoot 'em, it's gonna hurt like hell. Come on, guys. Looks like we're on the right track. I think I heard a muffled sound and then this man's voice came on. What did he say? Something about Jennifer's busy and could he take a message. Did you recognize the voice? No, I didn't. It wasn't Joey's. Joey? Jennifer's boyfriend. Can you describe the voice? It was gruff. Gritty. Was sort of I don't know. It was evil. Are you sure it didn't sound like anybody that you know? Mom, is sis coming back home? Yes honey, we're working on it right now. I hope so. I know. I hope so, too. Listen, go to your room. And everything's gonna be just fine in a minute. Look, it wasn't Joey's voice. I know you always suspect the boyfriend or the spouse in these disappearances, but I'm telling you the voice, it was almost mocking. Like some kind of a line from a western. Like Dirty Harry? Yes, but with some sort of pleasure to it. Anything else? No, then the line went dead. Okay, is there anything we should know? You're gonna find her, right? Sir, a person usually isn't reported missing until after the first 48 hours, but in this instance we think something may be a little off. Please, search for her. It's late. Tomorrow morning we'll go get a warrant. Triangulate the cellphone signal. See if we can pinpoint her exact location. What provider does your daughter use? Excuse me. Cellphone provider. Anytime Mobile. Okay, thank you for your time. We've got what we need. That's it? So you can't do anything? Not tonight, sir. But then again, this could just all be some kind of practical joke. Mr. and Miss Profit, we'll be getting back with you. Please. Look ma'am, you have my sympathies. You really do. But this is how our system works. Let's go pay this Joey a visit. Woman said it wasn't Joey's voice. Well, even if it isn't him, we still need to inform the parents anyway. Think we're gonna find 'em? Eh. Between you and me, these cases never end well. What the fuck is that smell? What the hell is that? It's a fucking dead body, man. Oh my god. Sick bastards. Wonder how many he's killed. When I was a kid, they would talk about this serial killer in the news and they called him. Crimson Butcher. That's right. It was the Crimson Butcher. He used to cut people up and scatter their body parts all over the highway and sometimes even people's front porches. And then just one day he stopped, but the bodies. The bodies, they kept on disappearing. You know they never found that guy, man. Yeah well this guy knows what he's doing, so could be dealing with him firsthand. You see that? One bullet. Hell yeah. Take it just in case. Good. Let's get the hell out of here, man, before I fucking throw up. Oh my god, look. Let me see. You think it's? Yeah. Poor guy. And that? It's the Crimson Butcher. Oh my goodness. Come on check that out. It's a map. See that X at the end of that road. I wonder where it goes. Well there's only one way to find out. Take it. Come on, let's go. Let's get the hell out of here. I can't. You all right, man? You all right? Oh my god, Paul. Paul. No, no. No, no, no, don't tell me, man. He's dead. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I was such a dick to him, man. So sorry. I don't even know why. No, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, words can't describe how sorry I am. You can go, okay. I didn't want this type of bloodshed on my hands. I didn't expect this. I didn't see this coming. Bro. My fucking brother died for you, man. There's no way we're going. No fucking way. Fuck that motherfucker. We're gonna fucking kill him. We're gonna fucking kill him, baby brother. We're gonna fucking. These motherfucking cocksuckers. I'm gonna shove this fucking gun so far up the fucking psycho's ass. He's gonna fucking throw up. Let's go, man. I'll come back for you, baby brother. Come on, man. Baby brother. What if we missed something, man? Yeah, like what? I mean, we were only in that shed for a few minutes. Okay, you wanna go back? No. But think about this. What if we can cause a distraction? Spill the gas. There's more than enough to burn that thing to the ground. And then the crazy guy investigates. Bam, bam, bam. We nab his ass. Okay. You think that'll distract him? I mean, it's a gamble. Yeah well odds in favor? Not too sure there, man. Flip a coin. Hold that. Okay. Heads in favor. Tails we get out of here. Okay. Heads. All right. Goodbye, cabin. Don't y'all know who you want to deal with? Who the fuck are you? Another animal without horns. Die like my brother, bitch. Yes. We got him, man. Fucking got him. You got him. The Crimson Butcher finally goes down. Woo. Feels good, man. Can't believe it. Holy shit. Stocking Eagle report back. Stocking Eagle report back. Stocking Eagle, you know how impatient I can get. What do we do? Stocking Eagle, you better report now. You hear me? Sorry, Stocking Eagle taking a piss. What's your 20? What the hell's a 20? He wants to know what our position is. What's your position, Agent Orange? I'm in good position. There's gonna be a slaughter tonight I tell you what. Fantastic. Well, I'm as excited as a kitten in a cage with 52 rats. Kitten in a cage with 52 rats. There's a good one. So what's your position, Eagle Orange? Now why would I reveal something like that? I don't understand. Clarify? First off, my brother's got an IQ of a fifth grader. He doesn't understand similes or metaphors or talk like a sharp witted military private. I'm guessing you're Tom. Aint that the truth? Listen here, asshole. The cops are on their way so you better give up. No sir, the law is not on their way. What makes you think that? Police scanner. Fuck you, man. You sure did a number on my brother. If we weren't related, I'd congratulate you myself. Fuck your camera. You know what? I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down. I wouldn't do that. Why not? Rule number one. No fires. Light it up and Alice dies right now. - Don't do it. - He's bluffing. Don't do it. I can't take that chance. Look up there. You see that camera? If I burn this shit down, this whole tree's gonna be an inferno and that camera's gone. If you believe I'm bluffing, hear this. Tom. Tom, I'm scared. Alice. Are you hurt? I'm scared, Tom. He has a knife at my throat. Okay darling, listen. I'm gonna make everything better, okay. I promise. I'm gonna make everything all right. Listen asshole, we won't burn down your shed okay. That a boy. Listen to your manager. That cabin's got sentimental value. My first kill was in there. What do you want? I want you to kill your partner. Do it and I'll release your sweet little darling. Kill that dumb jock and Alice is all yours. How do I know I can trust you? What choice do you have? I can slit her throat right here right now and there's nothing you can do about it. No, Tom. Think about this. If we stick together, we can save her. I don't know, man. What do you mean you don't know? I fucking risked my life for you and now my brother, he's dead. I don't think the cameras are wired for sound. Run into the woods now. Run. Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you okay. Fuck off. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. Really? Yeah. There. Now you're dead. How do we know there's no cameras out here? I don't know. I didn't see any. We also didn't notice the camera over there by the shed. Oh yeah well we'll just act like there aren't any over here. Okay. Okay. So you stay here and I'll tell the guy that I blew a couple holes in you. But what if he wants proof? Well then I'll drag your bitch ass over there and you play dead. Okay. Cool. Okay, it's done. How do I know you're telling the truth? I mean, I've done everything you've asked me to do to this point. Now I love Alice. I don't care about anyone else but her. So trust me, he's dead. Now you're a murderer. Nah, I'm not a murderer. I see it more as a trade. Life for a life. Now release her. Drag Joey's body into the camera view. Okay, I can do that. Well? He wants to see your body. Just lay down, act dead, and I'll drag you to the cabin. Here, hand me that stake. Now you know I can't do that, man. Please. Look, I don't even appear to be shot, okay, and if you drag me over there with this thing in my hand, he's gonna know that I'm not dead. Well why do you think I want the stick? Because you wanna kill me, okay. I can see it in your eyes. Dude, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay. Yes you are. Look you want this stick so that I can't defend myself okay. How stupid do you think I really am, man? No, I want the stick so I can. Hold on. I'm gonna cut you. What? Not that deep. What is that gonna prove? I'm gonna cut you and I'm gonna smear blood all over you and he's gonna think you're dead. How deep, man? Maybe two millimeters. All right, man. Do it. Just a few inches, all right. Hurry up. Quick, man. Fuck. Smear some on your face. Should I leave my eyes open or closed? I don't know. Close 'em. I mean, I doubt that cameras have that good of resolution anyways so play possum. All right, you owe men, man. Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you what. We get out of this alive and in one piece, I'll get you full ride wherever you want. You know I'll get you to shake on that if I wasn't being dragged like a dead man, okay. Yeah. Hey, you're gonna come back for me, right? Of course. All right. Good job. You're a predator after all. Where's Alice? Follow the yellow brick road. You don't need that. Come on over. How do I know I can trust you? You trusted me enough to kill your friend there. Now come unarmed and fast. You'll know it when you see it. Yeah well I'm unarmed. How do I know you won't kill me? I like you. Yeah and what about Alice? Oh, I just adore her. Listen, don't you dare hurt her. Promise is a promise and I keep my word. Bear trap on the left. You and Alice will be treated as guests, but break a rule. Well, let's not even think about the consequences of that. You're close. Get up, Tom. I'm dead, aren't I? You can do this. Drop the radio, ring the bell, and don't even think about grabbing that pick ax. Hurry up, Tom. We're waiting. Like cattle to the slaughterhouse. Come on in, son. Oh and wipe your feet. Follow me to the dining room. You hungry, boy? No sir. Do you live here? All my life. And. All your questions are gonna be answered in due time. Okay, Mr? Call me Bob. Thank you, Bob. My God, are you hurt? I'm fine. Are you sure? I love you. I love you, too. Changed my clothes for you, Tom. I can see that. I'm glad to see you all got here in one piece. I'm Leon. I'm her brother. What? That's my brother, Tom. What do you mean? We're related. That's my older brother. And that's Uncle Bob. You're telling me that that psychopath is your brother? Yes. Now, come have a seat. Push up. That psychopath is a killer. He's family. He's a killer. Loosen up. Enjoy your food. Everything's gonna be okay. Would you like some sweet tea, darling? Yeah, tea would be great. How's that southern hospitality? Food's fantastic. It's organic. None of those pesky chemicals or genetically altered things involved. You know Leon and his twin brother James were the ones that were persistent about going organic. I prefer quick and easy. But they made the right decision. Listen, I'm sorry about your brother James. He died a brutal death. - We saw. - We saw. Bless his soul. He's in a better place. I loved James but he was dull witted. He almost spilled the beans some years ago. He was great but a liability. Let bygones be bygones. I was a little disturbed. Sorry. Leon and Uncle Bob, they were very hurt. I'm sorry. I didn't know. It was a test after all. Out with the old. Usher in the new. So how 'bout it, brother? Brother? You're gonna be marrying Miss Alice here. We're gonna be brothers in law soon and I like that. Brothers. Yeah. I was the only child growing up so I'd like that. Family. It's the most important thing in the world. So you planned all of this? It was Uncle Bob's idea. But why? How else was I supposed to know how committed you were to me? But all of this? Tom, you cheated on me remember? Yeah and I apologized. We still had to make sure. We don't want the wrong people coming into this family. Listen. I know this breaks tradition, but let me show you something. Isn't it marvelous? I've been working on it and designing it since I was 14 years old. My uncle taught me how to sew to get my mind off things. Keep me from being terrified and things that were in my nature. How long did it take? I've been working on it for four straight years now. Then I stopped when I had to move up north to go to college. It was never completed until tonight. I put the final stitch on and now it's my masterpiece. It's beautiful. You should get ready for the big event. Big event? It's our wedding day, silly. We're getting married. Where? Here in this house of course. Don't we need a minister? My Uncle Bob. He's certified to marry us. And my brother Leon, he can bare witness. What's wrong? It's just sudden. You proposed and we're getting married. I've been dreaming about this wedding day for over a decade now. What it would be like to get married. Now the dress is complete. You should get ready. I didn't bring any formal attire. I know your size. Come on. Follow me. Major lead goes cold after witness found mutilated. November 2012. Mooner brothers landed on FBI's top 10. Private investigator gone missing. Body parts found. The Crimson Butcher. She's the butcher. You better get dressed. The ceremony's about to start. And make it quick. Ready? Tom, are you all right? Are you the Crimson Butcher? After my folks died, I resorted to violence to cope. How'd you get away with it? My brothers. They started killing after they found out I was being spied upon. That way the authorities wouldn't find out and they would rule me out. And they did. How many did you kill? Why does that even matter? I'm changed now. I don't turn to violence anymore. I need you. Does that make sense? I guess. Motherfucker. Fucked with my sister, huh? Fuck with my sister Alice. No. Goodbye, Tom. Who are you, lady? Leon. Who are you? Fucker. Crazy bitch. Fucking bitch. This is for my brother, bitch. Fuck. Fuck both of you. Geez Joey, is that you? What happened? We gotta get out of here. Some psycho people tried to kill me. We gotta go to the police. Get in, son. What happened there, Joey? I got stabbed by some crazy lady. Well, let me take you to the cabin. We'll get you all fixed up, buddy. Excuse me. What cabin you talking about? Damn it, Joey. Why'd you have to get mixed up in all this shit? Shit. Good morning, sunshine. About time you woke up. You crazy bastard. I'm gonna kill you when I get out of this. Oh, is that so? Oh, I know so. I don't think so, son. This is the end of the road for you.
