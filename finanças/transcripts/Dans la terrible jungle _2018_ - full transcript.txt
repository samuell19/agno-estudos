Well, I think the battery's dead. Come on, it's easy. Here you go. It's easy, right? No, not that way, you moron. Here, mix! You're not... Mix, Sarah! I am mixing! But you're not mixing like me. You really have to copy me. That's dance, you know. You've got to copy everyone and dance at the same pace. I don't want my band to be humiliated because of you, alright? No way, Sarah! Leave it. IN THE MIGHTY JUNGLE The sun is shining Midnight or midday news The sun shines Of course, it's... Exactly... It must be exactly four or five. Wait. In the MEI, we can often see little bunnies; some soft, some less soft. Pigeons... I coo the pigeons I coo the pigeons Are you coming, Hugo? So, there's the overalls. Take it easy. Wait, give me your notebook, thanks. So, Gaël... No! Climb in this way, not that way. It's forbidden to climb like that. There is a way to climb. Do you want to take that off? I'm closing. So what are the instructions? There are instructions for using the trailer. It's forbidden to stand up. - What? - It's forbidden to stand up. Great Gaël. That's it. It's Gaël, it makes him feel better. - So, what are the rules? - You can't stand up. - You don't... - Stand up. - Right. - Because it can be dangerous. And once you're there? What do we wait for? We... we wait... Until I... stop. The engine. OK? Those are the safety rules. OK, fine. - We know already Éric. - Yeah but it's better to repeat them. - Let's go? - Yeah. Where are you? Here, listen to my voice. - Here. - Yeah, I see you. - You see me? - Yeah. I may have a disability, but I'm not that disabled. Good, Simon. Go on, you're doing great. Éric, can I take my break? Oh no, it's not break-time! Break is at four. Come on! Yes, it's at four. No, it's now. No, it's five to. We said four. - It's in five minutes. - Exactly, that's it. Ah, there you go. Éric! I found a treasure! OK, but leave it on the side. Put it back there. Leave it there. - What is it? - It's a concrete block. It's clicking in my ear. It's working. I'm standing far away, because... Hi Sarah! - Hi Nouria! - I'm good and you? - You OK? - How is it going, dear? You're here tomorrow? Yes, but not Wednesday. See you tomorrow? Tomorrow evening? Okay, then, take care! - It's nice next to... - It's pretty. And my little brother is next to my big brother. It's not too high, not too low. So you'll see them when you lie down. I can say hello. OK, I will show you my dress. But I like you better with long hair than with short hair. When it's short you look a bit... Old? No, it's a bit too nerdy. - Yeah? Like clever? - Nerdy. Nerdy. But you look good with long hair. Yeah I know, that's what everyone says. No, Christina, on channel 6. Every week. Ah, yeah I know. Well, there was a young woman that didn't hang anything up and Christina said that dresses and tops have to be hung, because... They say that when you unfold your clothes, your tops, your dresses, you can see the folds. And she says that it doesn't look good at all. - Really? - Yeah, that's what she says. Isn't it inside-out? But that's just her opinion. No, but Christina's a pro. She gets these things. Ophélie, we're going to class. You come put your coat on? Ophélie? We're going to class. - Yes? - Are you coming? - Ophélie? - Yes? Should we go? Are you coming? I think you have class. - Don't you? - Yes I do. Yeah. Put your coat on. - After schol... - Yes? Er, I mean school. You coming? Zumba. - You coming? - Yo! This way. - It means "yes". - Yo. Twenty-six. One-eight. - Eighteen. - Eighteen. Let me have a look please. OK, carry on. Twelve. There's no five, so it can't start with... - Fifty-twelve. - So it's twelve. OK, let's move on. Three. Yes, three dozen. And? - Five units. - Perfect! It's fifty-seven. No, it's not fifty-seven, it's seventeen. Go on, higher Florence. Trampoline! Tramp-trampoline. Go on. Pedal! Great, Amélie. Look! - Anne-Sophie! - Yes. Look at me. It's great, keep going. - Will I arrive? - It's straight ahead, keep going! No, the other way with the pedals. There you go. I podle, you podle... I pedal. You pedal. He pedals. We pedal. You pedal. They pedal. Perfect! Paranoia, can't find sleep No problems, crawling on cash I'm handling the biz under the sun I'm handling the biz under the sun That's it. - Wait! - It's totally dumb. It's totally dumb. Can I say the word I'm thinking of? - Any better music? - First, Valentin... First, if you wanna lift, you do that. You don't do like you did. Yeah, honestly... That was pretty lame. "Games" it's G-A-M-Z, right? S! Plural. Without the S for singular. - At the end? - Yes. Cédric? Do you think that very skinny girls are pretty? No. Cool, me neither. I shouldn't have written "people laughing". Did you see Sarkozy? I did! I don't give a shit about Sarkozy, I don't like him. What does he do for France? He stays in his chair and works, that's it. It's not really that hectic. Oh, Youssef! Hi there You-You. - Is it done? - Yeah. I think we'll let it soak in a bit. You drowned it a bit. I put a little bit, not too much. A little bit, not too much, huh? - It's Fun Radio, Léa. - So what? But I like NRJ better. "My heart beats when you... "When you come back, my heart sparkles in my eyes." OK... You're gonna write that? Well, it's what I wanna write, but I'm not sure you can say that. She'll think it's too long. Wait... Someone's here! Yeah, I think she's gonna be shocked. No, she'll think it's too long. Maybe she'll think it's too long, but how am I supposed to tell her? "You're a gorgeous blonde, skinny, with beautiful eyes." No, no. I shouldn't say "skinny" or she'll be shocked. No but it's true. "You've got a nice face." Yes? "You've got nice hair." Yeah and what next? - "You've got a nice phone." - No no... "Because when you're away from me, "I feel like crying myself sick. "And when you come back, "I see sparkling hearts around me "and my joy flows to you." Yeah, you could say that. OK, I think it's good like that. Let's go see Youssef. Alright? I think it's good. Leave it, that's fine. We'll decorate with it, we'll put it that way, with the skin on, I think it's nice like that. It's a very small one. OK. We'll take it, should we go? Take it easy, try not to mix it up. Come on. Let's go. Nothing here. Only mud. What's it like? Only mud. Well, one more house to do. Besian, knee pads are for knees. Watch out for the cables, they're all over the place. How's it going Ludo? You can turn the water off. - Done? - No leak here. - But, Besian! - What? Can you go flush the toilets? There's someone in the bathroom. A one, a two, a one, two, three! Off I go! I sweep. I sweep. Hurry up, Ophélie, we're waiting for you. Yeah. OK then, let's go! I see you in the mirror. Yes. This is for extra safety. So if there's a problem, I can stop right away. Stop, yes Gaël, it means "stop". Gaël is happy, you see? Hi, Gaël. - Let's go? - Let's go. Alright, let's get going. So what do we always have to do? Work as a... A teap. A tame. - A t... - Team. - And is it important to work as a team? - Yes. To be supportive of one... another. To do a job, right Éric? To do a job. - As a team. - As a team but also to do a job. And working as a team, it helps doing what after? The techniques we learn now, what is it for? To go to another ESAT. I mean, somewhere else. Work in...? In an ESAT. Right, so all the techniques that we learn will be useful in the ESAT. Alright? Go on, you can... - Can I try with the wheel? - Put it in the hole. Seems OK, doesn't it? Maybe a little bit more. What do you think? A bit more? Take it out. A bit more there. After, I put everything with the boxes? - I put them with the boxes? - No. - Without the boxes? - Without them. Empty the box onto your tray, and then put it there. I got it. Use both hands. Use both hands, Gaël. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday... Wednesday! I'd like to make a point of this. Louise was asking for help, no one came to give her a hand and the rest of you were arguing about I don't know what... Allan, we already had this discussion and you didn't get it. Do we have to put your name down every day, lunch and dinner, to help with chores? I only do Wednesdays. No, Allan... - Allan! - Wednesday lunch. - There are others... - Listen. Your friends also have their turn to set the table, just like you, but it doesn't stop them from helping out sometimes, even if it's not their turn. I only do the dishes on Monday. So, you show no solidarity. You won't help a friend if it's not your turn? No. Don't expect the others to help you out when you ask them. Yeah. And you may end up on the calendar every day. No. You won't make any effort? Then we won't either. I only do... The efforts need to come from everyone. You are a group. We already talked about this, about solidarity and cooperation. Am I wrong? Yeah, we did. Talk about something else. - What? - Please, Louise. If we have to discuss the community rules, we will. It's not for you to decide. Alright? So, this is a problem for you, you're not pleased, but that's no reason to refuse to discuss it. So please pull yourself together. And stop sulking. Because nobody had anything against you, Allan. You get all worked up on your own. Anything else to discuss about communal life? No. Why can't we do everything we want? Grown-ups decide the rules, and when we're old enough, we have to be responsible for ourselves. Wait. Wait. So it was Léa that had talked about it. When we are old enough to... to learn to... - For the rules, right? - No, to get the rules. No comment, please. Thank you. It's when you feel responsible and you tell yourself "I'm grown up, "I don't need rules anymore, "I know them, I must follow it." Am I right? - "I must follow them." - Follow them, yeah. You can eat with your fingers, it's not forbidden, but when it's chocolate or fries, that sort of thing. Next I had: we're allowed to think, but not too much. We can put our fingers in our nose but it's not very clean. It's not forbidden against the law. Then I wrote: we can't play with our knife. Why is it always forbidden? - You might poke your eye! - For example. Not on purpose, without knowing, stabb... not stabbing but... without meaning to, if there's someone walking behind and hop, he drops the knife and that the knife lands in the back of the person behind him, not in purpose. Or maybe someone is playing with a knife, across from someone, and the other person might get hit in the face. Thank you, Léa. Welcome to Skyrock, Aymerick here, I have all the best tunes... You see what happened In the MEI... I'm only doing stupid things Stupid things... When you're not here I broke the toilet I flooded the bathroom I rang the alarm While you weren't here I broke the doors I broke the beds I ripped the documents And I spat on the computer I wrecked the computer I wrecked the printer And I had a drink And had syrup that I spilled on the printer You shouldn't have gone You see what happened I'm only doing stupid things Stupid things when you're not here I wrecked your cigarettes I put them in my underpants You went through the window? I'm not sayin'. Well, you've got to say Simon. Did you go through the window? I'm sorry, Éric. Simon, it's OK, you're allowed to blow a fuse, but you have to communicate. Properly. Blow a fuse but in a suitable way, alright? Come on. Are you upset? - What? - Are you upset? You do things you shouldn't do. And you don't even tell me off. We already did tell you off, and I told you what you did. I don't agree with you, alright? I'm done with it... Simon. Hey, what's the problem? Pardon? Wait, calm down. You can cry. Go on, cry. Simon, good thing I caught you. Go on, stand up. That's it now. Alright? - Is it alright? - Yes. Do you feel better, now that you've cried? Yes. Where is he going now? Well, Simon is currently at home, for now. Fine by us. Right now, they're looking for a room for him on a special ward. That's good. To find him an appropriate treatment. - That's great. - A treatment that suits him. Apparently Dr. Bayard said his treatment wasn't right for him anymore, they have to do more research and try some other treatments. Right, that's why he'll be hospitalized. What kind of hospital? To be able to try the drugs, and test the effects on him. And to find the best treatment to fight his anxiety and make him feel better in his own skin. It's better without Simon and the others. It's better without Simon and the others? You can say how you feel, you know. Because he has been pretty violent. Wait, Allan. If you want to say something, about yourself, you can. About how you felt. Youssef, I don't wanna say hello on Monday. That's not what we... Monday I don't want to say hi. If he keeps running off... Why, Allan? If he doesn't stop running off, I don't wanna say hi. But why? Yeah, but we have to help him to feel better here. If you start ignoring him, he's not going to feel good. It's not what he needs at the moment. Wait, Youssef. He is violent with us, he threatens us. Why in the world would we want to talk to him? He's absolutely right. Me, I'll say hello, but I'll force myself. I'm sorry. He's violent, he runs, when he wants to stop an activity, we all have to stay here. Look at the state Béa was in, I'm not happy. So I'll say hello because I am polite, but I won't say it willingly, for sure. We can't force you to... That's for sure. Because it's not normal. I'm sorry, but... Have you had the opportunity to tell him that, with these words, calmly? But Louise, one day we tried to, but His Highness... he got annoyed and went to his room. So how can we make him understand? No, but he gets annoyed, he reacts the way he reacts. But he should hear how you feel, you're also part of the group. So his behavior has an impact on group life. Yeah but Louise, then he'll say "yeah, anyway, blablabla", then he'll run off and it's gonna spoil the evening. So why would we tell him? His Highness is gonna run off anyway. We aren't sure about that, maybe it'll make him feel better. And maybe he'll get calm. If you don't help him. He also needs our help. You think we want to help him? With all the stupid things he does? - We can't force you. - I really don't want to help him. What a trip! Damn! Stop it! You're a pain! Stop it now, I'm not playing with you. Too late. What did I say? I'm not playing with you! Stop. I don't wanna fight. Leave me alone! Benjamin, stop it, please. Stop it! I don't care, I'll tell Éric. I'll tell Éric. Take that on your head. Where is Bastien? I'm here! There's a little problem. When you need me, call me from your room. Don't go out in the corridor like that. Do you understand? Bastien. - Will you call me next time? - Yeah. OK, great. Do you want to play a little? I repeat: do you want to play a little? - Yes, play a little. - I'll let you do it. But why do cats continue to hunt while they are fed? To pierce this mystery, we must go back to their origins. What is she looking at? They do not come down from a tiger, a panther or a lynx, no, our domestic cats come down from the cat. Yeah, but if you want to be a secretary, there's also the... the school skills. There's also... There's lots of things. And for now you are in an MEI, so if you want to be a secretary, you'll have to leave the MEI and go to a specialized school, a school for the blind but with a higher level. That's what they said. At La Pépinière MEI, you can't study to be a secretary. After the MEI, you either go to a work center, or nothing. Because some of us... can't go further. - You're right. - That's why. As long as you are in an MEI, you can't be a secretary. You have to transfer to a school for visual impairment. Like for example the ERDV. That's what Richard told me, I have to go to a... To be able to do that, I need to go to a high school that's... - Special. - A special high school. Like the ERDV. - You're in middle school now, right? - It's too soon for me to talk about it. I must not think about it, they told me not to think about it. But they said I have a lot of abilities. They said I have a lot of abilities. Yes but look, I also have abilities, but I don't have the school level to be a secretary or a doctor. Even if people tell you you have abilities, it doesn't mean you can do advanced studies. Sometimes, it's not possible. We may have more abilities than some other kids, but the school level is too high for us. - Yeah, no. - Because it's too complicated. That's why. There, you pull it up. If it's easier for you. Are you in? No. Come on, try. Don't be upset. I think you have to... I think you have to touch it, to feel when it's in properly. Do you feel something? It's inside. Alright? - Yes. - Let's do it again. - Is it in? - No! Yes you are. Well, very good! Go on, hold it with your right hand and pull it with your left hand. Great! Now you need a coat with a zipper. Yeah! Because yours is broken. - Will you tell mom? - Yes. Go on, pick it up. Two... Ophélie, two. Three. And six! Ah, six! Now I'll leave you alone. - May I answer? - You are the one calling, Ophélie. Hello? Hello Bastien! Bastien? I did a great job! I zipped the zipper! Tell him who's speaking. You haven't said. My name is Ophélie. - Ophélie what? - Lefebvre. That's good! Like that, there you go! Now we climb down. Walk backwards. Easy! Turn around, look. There you go. Watch out. Well done! Good job, Gaël! Good. Now, let's go back up. Let's go. Hop, here we go! Gaël? Let's keep on, Gaël! We'll carry on mowing. We'll carry on. We are going to mow. Alright? Come here, easy. Easy, Gaël! You're going to hurt yourself. Take it easy. Sit down! It's enough. It's enough! Gaël, it's enough! Come on! Is it over? Enough now? Go on, sit down. What's wrong? So? What's the problem? Gaël, here. I'll give it to you. I'll go get it, sit down. Sit down. What's the matter? What's the matter? You hurt yourself, didn't you? It's spectacular. Yes, I know what you're looking for. Let's go get it. Come. Will you wait for me? It's there, we'll go get it. I'll go get it. Will you wait? Are you waiting for me? Sit down. I'll go get it. Here. Now let's get your glasses. Five minutes with Éric. Come here, we'll do it after, stay with Éric. Alright? No! Gaël! Come here with me! Gaël! Your glasses! What are you looking for, Gaël? What are you looking for? Do you need help, Gaël? Are you alright, Gaël? Are you alright? Have you released enough tension? You want to carry on? Want to push the mower? Shall we mow? Come on. Let's go. Shall we go? Good. Keep going. I'm still alive, rest assured Still dynamic, I'm still standing I'm rebuilt, back on my feet Standing tall, resurrected All those people falling around me It's a bloodbath, it's like in Guernica All these people falling, thousands are falling Yet I am still here I'm still alive, rest assured Still dynamic, I'm still standing He's yet to be born or he's gonna suffer The moron who wants to bury me I ain't go on TV now, or even Internet I refuse interviews from the press They believed I had disappeared, I was forgotten Tell all these assholes I'm still singing "All of a sudden, the ghost... the door creaks." "The door creaks." Then... "The ghost takes the kid to the hill "and ties him up! "Suddenly, the walls are bleeding." And then... "The ghost goes through the door. "The ghost takes the kid with him. "The ghost leaves the kid all alone, "unattended. "Suddenly, the ghost doesn't see the superhero come "and save all the children." The end. End of the first... second chapter. End of the second chapter. If you liked this story, you can watch... the film. Thank you. Good bye. Watch the film, yes, watch the film. Actually, there aren't any social workers at the MEI. There are... There isn't even a night watchman. And all the kids were kidnapped by a ghost. When the ghost kidnaps you, I come to your rescue. I'm a superhero. And all that. Ophélie is happy to go to... to the pool. - Can we relax? - Yes, we can. OK then, listen carefully! A one, a two, a one, two, three, four! Prune my hips with an axe I've eaten too much chocolate Crunch my skin, if you please Crunch my bones, if need be It's time for great transformations At the tips turnaround of my tits Sneaking in, all pointy You find two nuts, crack! You eat them It's time for great transformations On the brim of my parted lips A silvery red raspberry bush is growing Could you kiss me to cut it off Knead my hips with your kisses I'm becoming Chocolate Woman Let my Nutella hips melt The blood in my veins is hot cocoa One day I'll fly away Through the sky Ballooning higher and higher It's essential to be in top form. So, give yourself a treat, eat well, eat rabbit. This was a message from "Saveur en or" and your local farmers. Go ahead, throw grass back! Put on your hood Put on your hood Bazooka, B-A-Z...

I'm your friend, I cannot lie to you, you know it. I've decided to let you have him, because you're my best friend. I know that you love him. I love him too. What's happening? Do something like that. No, watch, listen... Something like that. It was nice, what you did. Thanks. Well, thank you. Wait, wait. Go on. - Great. - Is it good? Jean-Claude, what did I play? Yeah. I want to be a singer. Later, I'd like to be a singer, but there's a problem. I asked, but the problem is I can't, because you have to study in Paris. It's not easy. To begin with, you need a pretty voice. That's the real problem. Well, yeah. So I guess I'll do something else. No, for sure I won't... I'd like to be a singer, but it's just too hard. That's the thing. And you need to invent the songs. It's not very easy. Go on! Well done! Only women are working, no guys. Stéphanie you shouldn't work, your back is gonna hurt. I'm alright Médéric, don't you worry for me.
