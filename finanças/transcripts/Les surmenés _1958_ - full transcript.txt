We have time in our hands Don't be so hard with me It's better to say you don't want to go - Oh Catherine, please - Okay, okay A week passes Catherine pined for Bernard believing he would give up, but he is stubborn and she started to find that he was well settled down - You're lazy, that's what you are - Catherine, c'mon No, forget it Solange It's very interesting Well, you are old fashioned you don't want to live a modern life Is that so, do I have to dance everyday to live a modern life? I didn't leave the country to come live here like I was still there True, it would be hard to live in Paris just like in the country - Don't let yourself be controlled - You don't take any risks - Can't you stop? - No, don't worry it will pass We'll see about that Are you crazy no you know he's right All I know is that I was wrong Bernard's not for me Only because we want you to have a comfortable life Leave me alone Etienne and I have a responsibility Oh Etienne he would agree with me Oh, I'll never stop - Don't you drink? - Oh me... Alcohol... You're going to start You know, pleasure it's all about pleasure that will make you go to hell I'm already there I am the devil Will you give me a light? Here you are... - I don't smoke - I'll show you You have a nice lighter I'll give it to you A souvenir from the devil Jimmy was a kind devil and with him, Catherine discovers other charms of Parisian life You see shit Catherine took to the habit of sleeping late, like Etienne... but Etienne started to lose his usual good mood Euphoric, he became dark, nervous, everything angered him - Ah, but I told you I'm not hungry - Have a bit more, c'mon Oh, just leave me alone And this, what is it? It's the gas bill Oh, you see, you make fun of me, 12000 FF! Oh, I can't take it anymore - So, take a rest - It's not what I meant - And for Madam, it's? - An orange juice - They only fight at home - Who? Etienne... He's tired... And Solange is making a scene... you have to understand he works a lot - Jimmy I'm talking to you - Women are all the same How are they the same? - You too, you make a scene - both of you make me stressed - Me, I don't stress - Maybe, but you stress others Oh, but if it doesn't please you hey, you're free Can't you stop annoying me forjust one second? I annoy, thus I exist Not for me This evening, for the first time Catherine starts to question whether she took the wrong road but she was not mature enough to make a good conclusion And life goes on just the same For Etienne, more and more tired For Jimmy, without Catherine For Catherine, without Jimmy At work, as with her time, Catherine is living in constant agitation Your sister, Solange asked me to talk to you Is it any of your business? If you have problems with Mr. X or Y it's not my business Our business has been rocky for some time now - I am sure that... - Catherine A champion who gets out of shape is beaten by the weaker ones All this talk for a few little mistakes Don't be dramatic, I know the solution to your problems - You know? - Yes Here it is... - What is this? - You will find your secret in this book Are you joking? Catherine opened the mysterious book and didn't understand it at all At the same moment... So, Etienne... Well, Etienne, Etienne, are you ok? Etienne, hey, Etienne - Etienne, but what happened to you? - Nothing, nothing He didn't feel good, so I brought him here in a taxi Oh don't say stupid things It had to happen Now let's put him to bed - I don't need anyone - lean on me anyway The day after, Etienne didn't feel better so Solange called a doctor I'm going to the pharmacy wait until I get back to go to work - Don't forget the prescription - Thank you, doctor I will come back tonight around 5 pm till then have him sleep Doctor, what is it? I've checked your brother-in-law and I've given him different tests But I have the diagnosis its stress and exhaustion Stress? But that's doesn't mean anything Your brother- in- law has a tiring job You need to sleep more a lot Don't exercise anymore and don't do other activities you have a strong body But you have your limits Please convince him that he shouldn't overwork himself - Goodbye - Goodbye, Doctor Catherine was not convinced At work, an unpleasant surprise awaited her Her boss scolded her for being negligent at work She hoped Bernard would protect her but he hadn't said a word... Clearly the blame was on her At the end of the day she left in desperation Everything around her fell apart Etienne was sick, she wasn't a champion anymore, and Bernard abandoned her to a sad destiny He was the only one who could save her - Hello, Bernard? - It's Catherine Look at yourself it has been two months since I came to Paris I made a mistake I don't like favoritism But I could help you this time You are an angel I didn't say that I would do it I said that I could Bernard convinced his boss to forget about the problem that morning He also led Catherine to be a good employee and fiance He gave her a reconciliation kiss followed by a lover's kiss... sensitivity and reason coexisted this way Shhh... Catherine looks dead Don't be stupid, come here I'm going out to the store - I'm staying with him? - Yes, in case he wakes up I'll be back in a minute No, of course Etienne wasn't dead What is dead is the myth of the invincible man, who could do everything without worrying about the annoying rhythms of modern life; Catherine accepted reality She will now start anew She also regained confidence Bernard promised her he'd pick her up the following morning So what about this guy? - He's sleeping - That's what he does best - where should we go? - Anywhere is fine How about my office everything is in order there - Do you regret your crazy life? - No - Are you agitated about Jimmy? - No He was kind and he dances well but I won't be dancing anymore Why? It's not forbidden - Can you dance? - A little... Will you teach me? - When? - Tonight A few weeks later Catherine married Bernard but she found out a secret she didn't know Bernard! Yes - What was that book about? - Huh? Yes, the book you lent me what was the secret? - Ah, nothing - What do you mean, nothing? The secret was the book itself When you read a book that thick you can't stray how stupid I am not to know that your trick wasn't so smart either well, my trick is in La Fontaine's fables "the farmer and his children" the father told his children to search for a treasure in a field But there was nothing in the fields the treasure was the work itself You surely like La Fontaine
