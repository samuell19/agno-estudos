Lord, Truman! I wish you wouldn't bite. I wasn't sure you'd be here. I waited where you said last night. Waited the time before that too. Well, don't deny I'm worth the wait. Will you quit playing with me now? Truman, I... I've been wrapping it around myself to keep it in. Anybody know? Yes. My sister. You don't sneeze, she end up in your mouth studying your tonsils. She won't tell. When's it coming? I'm right-smack up against the gatepost. He's a-kickin' like crazy just now. He's the kickingest thing. Hell. Well, thank you, Jesus. Goddamn it. You love me, don't you? What's that? Just a little present for the mama-to-be. A something pretty. You know I like you all pretty and clean. Are you clean? You want me to do right by you? I was reared by a man of God. And I can speak his word. I can marry us right here. We'll be a family, Lena. You and me. We got a chance now. If we just say "I do." Just say "I do." Just let me have my baby first. I can anyway. Just say... Just say "I do." I do. ♪ Your mother called them the farmhouses ♪ ♪ Where he rose out of the ground ♪ ♪ If a woman walked ♪ ♪ And when she told the story ♪ ♪ She made such a sickening sound ♪ ♪ If a woman walked ♪ ♪ His blood like sap or syrup ♪ ♪ Would slow way down ♪ If a woman walked ♪ And the heart not beating ♪ Making no sound ♪ His nose flared wide ♪ And he in his scree voice ♪ Would grab and tear ♪ A woman straight down ♪ And choke the voice as it came screaming out of her ♪ ♪ And he'd take her there like that ♪ ♪ Nothing will grow ♪ Where anyone has suffered ♪ Nothing will grow ♪ Where anyone has died ♪ Nothing much grows in these mountains anywhere ♪ ♪ Except in the river bottom ♪ Where the proving's done ♪ I can tell you anything you'd like to know ♪ ♪ One of eight children ♪ All grown to eight great men ♪ ♪ Seven are gone now ♪ To start over again ♪ Rain is coming ♪ You can taste it ♪ The salty blood between your teeth ♪ ♪ The sound she made coming after me ♪ ♪ The sad song she sang ♪ When she's coming after me ♪ Ma'am, I found this on the... Ma'am? Ma'am? Stop that fighting. - Hey, how are you? - Good morning, ma'am. Ma'am, I found this'n up here. What you got there? Oh, good Lord. I don't know who it belongs to. I said hush, y'all. Just wondering maybe you knew, or maybe you'd be able to take it. Um... I'm sorry. I got my hands full as it is. I can't help you. You go on now. You clean it up, all right? Bye. Where's this road go to? Down, like any road. If that's how you want it. Where are you from? Any car come down this way? Might have been one last night. She got herself into big trouble. - Who did? - My sister. Her name's Lena. She's bigger than me. She missing? Is your foot hurting you? Blisters. Been up and down this county. Can't get no one to take it. Guess you been to all the wrong places then. Where'd you find that thing? Up along Bark Cove, under a laurel bush, around dawn. Right. Why don't you just take it, ma'am? Won't be no trouble. Because it ain't mine, and I know it must belong to somebody. And I'm betting you know who. Really? Well, I don't want it. Don't have a solitary need for it. Is it sleeping? Set it down, then. Gentle, now. Gentle. You Leroy's baby brother? I can see that. You're the one had that trouble up at Crossroads Tavern. Beat up a deputy or something. No, it wasn't me. That was Handy. Jess too. Wait, you were the one that played that devil's music so fine. You're... Raymond. Not anymore. I don't play fiddle no more. It's slow, just like every other day. I've been trying to sell off this junk here bit by bit. Can we interest you in a genuine Corelle cup or my mamaw's wedding quilt? How about a knife? Oh, that's right. Never give a Toker a knife. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Look, I don't need nothing. I'm just trying to unload what I already got. Now I'm asking you, please... please, ma'am, just take it. Can't do that. But I can offer you a nice cup of coffee. You can come on up here and have one if you like. Fresh brewed. Just leave that thing off of my porch. Milk? No, ma'am. Can't get too black for me. How about some sugar then? Oh, I like my Nescafé real sour. Sour enough to skin shellac off a table. Well, this is coffee made from a bean. So you don't know her. Who? Whoever birthed that baby. No. Just looking to get shed of it. Been feeding it? I ain't had it that long. It will need regular feedings. It's quiet, I'll give it that. Hey. Look. Thought you'd gone. This baby, this ain't no ordinary baby. Listen, that baby could cook me steak and eggs, and I still wouldn't take it. Best try your luck on some other fool. No luck at the Priddys's? I see you still got it. I see we can still call you mama. Your nipple sore yet? I'll give you 20 cents for a cup of coffee. Thirty if it got no bottom. All right. Have a look at that young'un. Pity it ain't a boy. Might be worth something then. I'd say the mama is right fair skin, and she ain't no midget. Ain't no dowdy. I thought he was a dowdy. He means daughtery. I had me every dowdy girl before they could tie a shoelace. Where did you have that one's mama, Toker? I had it on a mule plow in August. Front porch swing in a blizzard. Riding the back of a three-legged donkey in a cyclone. Well, I see the dead can still walk. How you can stand being men and go to sleep at night content with yourselves is beyond me. Why don't you build up that fire, Calvin. Yessum. You fix it up like I said? Awful big if the mama left it newborn. And that mama's likely cleared the state line by now. I know I would be. Well, I've seen uglier. I've had no child of my own, and looking at this one I can see my wisdom. The whole planet come to a screeching halt if she had her way about it. Was anybody asking you? The times I have struck that man dead in my sleep. Pistols, knives, poisons. I even run him over in a car once. I'd whump once, shift it into reverse, back it up, rev it, whump again. Best to clean her up now. No, no, I ain't holding it. You the second woman today refusing to hold this baby. It ain't natural. Ain't nothing natural, Raymond. What you doing, boy? What you doing carrying some stranger's baby around that way? Folks going to say she's yours. They'll say, "There goes another Toker "stirring up some mess. Thought we'd seen the last of that lot." She'd have perished if it weren't for me. Tokers always was hell-bent for nothing. Just be wary. That's all I'm saying. The world is cursed and cruel. Well, there we go. Okay... Why, hello there, sir. Fill her up, please. And perhaps you could spare me one small moment of your time. What you got there? Every spang-dangled product you could ever call on for a sparkling window or a shining floor. Your everyday ammonia, sir, ain't got nothing on this product. This is a unique, patented Amerishine formula that's designed to get even the nastiest old grime off the toughest surface. - And this... - Mister, mister. See that there? That there is chock-full of items I've been trying to unload since 1961. Well, then being a man of sales, you'll understand what I mean when I say that these... these items are priced to move. Now, since you are a part of my territory, and I've never actually worked this particular district... We can't even get the bus to stop here. I've heard of folks having to chase it. Is that right? My name's Truman Lester. - Calvin. - Pleased to meet you. Cal, you can't honestly tell me it would be sin to encourage a little cleaning in these parts. Now I know you've heard this probably, what, a thousand times before, but I can truly say that this is a one-time-only opportunity to benefit not only yourself and your customers, but an entire network of hardworking salesmen. Amerishine offers a unique profit-sharing plan. - Care to peruse this pamphlet. - Calvin! Perhaps I should speak with the lady of the house. Oh, no, you don't want to do that. Sometimes she... Whatever it is you got there, mister, we don't want any. Hurry it up there, Calvin. Why don't you get that baby some air, Raymond? Anything else? Uh, yes, sir. There is. I'll take some aspirin. I got a wicket toothache. And a pack of Camel filters while you're at it. I go through my smokes the way a washer woman splashes through her piles. I'll see if we got some. Oh, hillbillies. Oh, lookie here. Is that what I think it is? Oh, it lifts my spirits to see a new baby. They are so precious. What's that? A little girl, or a boy? Girl. A girl. Oh, my Lord. I love little girls. Yes, sir, I do. It's... Well, it's a tough road to hold, being a girl in this world. Am I right, friend? What's her name? I said, what's that'un's name? Didn't your mama teach you any manners? Don't have one yet. Pretty girl. God's breath, that's what they are. You pretty little thing. Bet you nobody ever told you that before. Oh, I don't mean no harm. I just like babies, is all. Well, he's trying to get rid of that one, if you're interested. Is that right? Where's her mama? At home. Home. Doesn't she want to hold on fast to her little treasure? Well, I'm only asking because I got one myself. Yes, sir, I'm a ding-dong daddy of the mountains myself. I'm slap-happy proud, same as you. Am I right, friend? That's right. Yeah, me and the little woman, we're proud as punch. She could tell you herself, she was here. I'll never forget the day our egg was joined. Uh, Cal, here. Try this on for size. My little angel dove is sitting on the porch in a little blue dress, and she's stuffing crackers into her mouth in a red cardboard box. I knew that moment the miracle of birth was going to happen right then and there. A man knows that moment. Well, then... you ever been separated from that child there? No, I reckon she's too young for that. Oh, gosh. She's calling to mind my own Lucinda. Could I hold her? Well, she's tired. Please? Come on, just... just for a second. Oh, don't you just love that new-baby smell? Hey. Oh, easy, friend. I'm just going to give this dear child something to remember me by. Hey, little darling. Hello, you precious thing. Look at that. She might get hurt. Oh, you have to forgive me, mister. What's your name? Raymond. When you get out on the road, Raymond, you start missing your kin. You get awful lonely, and... well, you start longing for your own. Here you go. Uh, no, Cal. You hold on to that. That's a free sample. Ah, appreciate that. Hey, you got the pamphlet there, Cal? You feel free to give Truman Lester a call anytime at the home office, you change your mind about Amerishine. All right. Appreciate it. Well, I best be on my way. Got a couple more stops, and going home myself. Like this. Short. And she's got new Keds on. White ones. Well, if she's of age and she's gone off of her own free will, I reckon it's out of your hands. But this is Franklin Cove, and it could be you'll find her. What you mean, of age? Sixteen. No, not till June. Lucky, hush, hush, hush. Never guessed you to possess no fatherly instincts. Though I do know you thought an awful lot of that sister of yours. Could be the mama's fainted. Could be she went back up there to find her. All right. That is 50 cents a dog by the day. You give them a wrapping to go on, they'll track her now. Go ahead, now Go ahead. Behave. Good luck. Up in heaven, they's throwing out the dishwater. That's what my daddy used to say. Among other things. See, that's old slack-jawed Jupiter up there saying we be less than spit on a string. If that rain could wash away sins we might have something. ♪ Hush, little baby ♪ Don't you cry ♪ Find you a mama ♪ My, oh, my I used to hold Princess Anne this way when she was a tiny baby like you. Yes, sir. I did. Looks like that storm caught you. I see you still got that barnacle too. You hate babies that much? I do. Never heard a woman say she hated babies before. Guess you been hanging around a pack of bald liars then. Or men. Same thing. You taking it to your place? That's sweet. How many years does Leroy got left, you don't mind me asking? Three. Three? For what he did? Get that battery up to Jenkins? Yup. Car's on the blink. Soon as I get it going again, I'll be flying on out of here. Why don't you come see me tonight. That is, if you don't have plans already. No, I... Fine. That's an invitation then. Dinner, around 8:00. Better find a mama for that baby by sundown, or get yourself a babysitter. Bye. - How you can take part in Operation: Blood Drop. I heard the thing this morning on WWXE radio. - Got any candles? - Upstairs. Hi. We're the old guard, so to speak. We run into each other from time to time... Isolated thunderstorms last night, yesterday afternoon... You expecting company? Can't a woman treat herself to the finer things in life? If she can afford to. A couple of thunderstorms, had some hail... That's better. Got a buyer on my piano so I can. That's good for you. I like that one. Yarns to stand your hair on end, tales to tie your limbs in knots. Ain't that what it says on the cover? Yup. Thanks, hon. Mm-hmm. Josephine, busy today. Some salesman feller come by. Raymond Toker. Twice. You know him. Youngest of them godforsaken Toker boys. We sent him up to your place early this morning. Guess I was sleeping in. Boy's been carting around some sorry infant since daybreak. You know any girl that might be missing her baby? Nope, not that a missing baby's a mighty loss. I'd be thinking it was his own he's trying to pawn off, I didn't know Raymond like I do. He's been down that rabbit hole going on six years now. Ain't no female ever been down there far as anybody knows or has seen. My own belief about Raymond and females is that... That it's nobody's place to get up in his business? What do I owe? 13.21, come to. Add it on. I'll pay before leaving. You still got them rose pattern dishes? - Yup. - Don't sell them. Yet. Okay. Get. Get on. ♪ There's a hundred bluebirds ♪ ♪ Up above the clouds ♪ Putting all the color in the sky ♪ ♪ Twice as many teardrops ♪ There to wash it down ♪ Every one's another lullaby There it is, baby. Home's where the heart sinks down. All right. Here we go. Now, what we got here? Oh, baby. Lord, I hate this place. Can't get no reception around here. Damn it. If you want and deserve a house, car, steady income, and a fine family to enjoy it with, it's all out there, friend. And it's up to you to take it. Don't forget, you have every right to success. Every right to success. All you have to say is... All I have to do is say it. Get out there and make it mine. Get out there. Make it mine. Dreams really can come true. Mine. Mine. And this is the most amazing thing about Amerishine-brand cleaners. The almighty shine. Polish that up. There we go. Now show your mama that shine. Come on, Ashley. Show mama that shine. Ashley, let mama see it. - Go ahead. - No. Ashley, will you go up to your room then? Thank you for your help. That's a darling child. Thank you. Well, you've got a fine family, ma'am. There's something to be said for a roof over your head and loved ones beneath it. Oh, yes. In my line of work, you can't lay down roots. No, it ain't easy. I've been working high and low, and I'm a man of many states. Is that right? See, I was reared up north by my daddy, Joe Lester. He was a salesman too. Yes, I'm one in a long line of salesman, carrying the Lester name right along. Folks today, they don't respect the family line. We must carry that line. - What about your mama? - Oh, she was from these parts. Just upriver, matter of fact. Hi, sweetie. So you could say I've got no home, or you could say I've got more than one. Ashley, stop it, honey. Hey, hon. I've got something for you. It's grape. Ashley Jean Monroe, what do you think you're...? Can you hold her for a minute? Thank you. Ashley, you come with me. I want to talk to you. I am... I'm sorry. You are going to get it. Sorry, Mom. It wasn't my fault. Come on, let's go. I'm so sorry. Oh, that's all right. No offense meant, ma'am, but I must confess my own baby girl smells sweeter than this. She's just got a glow about her. My darling. She just shines with her own special light. They are a blessing. Amen. I'm heading home to her sweetness right now. How nice. Look, I'll take that starter kit you mentioned. Mister? So, I'll take that $5 one. Fine. I'm sure you and yours will find a million and one uses for these fine products in your lovely home. Gave this to Princess Anne on her third birthday. There's Mama and Daddy, my brothers. There's Handy, Jess and Leroy. That's me and Princess Anne. A couple months before the fire. Hate to leave you by your lonesome. Go have a quick look-see for your mama. You won't even know I'm gone. Sleep now. Lucky! Peter! Here. Here. Here. Go. Go. Oh, Lord. Lord, child. What you doing back here? I'm resting. Been walking these hills since last night. Seen plenty. Can you fix me a sandwich? There you go. That's a ticket. - Here you go. - Appreciate it. - Let me get you change. - No, Cal. You keep that change. Just a little something from one salesman to another. We all need a little encouragement now and then, - am I right? - Yeah, I appreciate that. - Thanks a lot. - Uh, one more thing, if... You know that good-looking fella who was here today with the baby? - Yeah. - Does he live around here? Yeah, well, now, he's up Bennett Cove. What you do... I'll tell you what. - Go back the way you came. - Back this way? Uh-huh. Follow that about 2 miles. Yeah, now you're going to run into some switchbacks up there. I'll tell you, if you'll take the right fork... every road you come to, take the right fork. You're basically going to come to... I told you 8:00. Good evening, ma'am. Who the hell are you? I'm expecting company. Well, perhaps the gentleman's been delayed. You look like you just might be interested in some of my Amerishine cleaning products. Ain't it a little late in the day to be doing business? Oh, it's never too late. Where'd you get that dress? Cincinnati. Cincinnati? Yeah, I can tell right off you spent some time up north. You like it up there? Well, Cincinnati's a fine town. Must be hard coming back here after getting a taste of that life, am I right? Maybe. What's your point? It becomes you. Becomes me? Yes, it does. And it's nothing to be ashamed of. Women around here take no pride in themselves. Worn to a nub by the age of 22. Tragic. Tragic. I don't know about that. Well, then, I hate to take any more of your time, Miss...? Josephine. And I'm Truman Lester. Sure you don't want to try a free sample of my polishing wax? Ain't a whole lot left in this house to polish. Well, all right, then. Well, it was nice to meet you, Josephine. Have a fine evening. Hey, what kind of car you got down there? A Dodge. It's a Dodge Royal Monaco. Burgundy leatherette on the seats. Want to take a ride in it? I got my own car. Anyway, I don't go riding with strangers. So, uh, what do you do for fun then? Well, been a long day. Maybe you'd be kind enough to let me come in and sit awhile? You see, frankly, Josephine, I'd appreciate some stimulating conversation before I head back up north. Nobody around here for me to chat with. God, I hate working this territory. Yeah, I can't track down a single address to make a sale in these coves. Real discouraging. Tried my luck earlier today over the store there. Yeah, so I heard. Did you? You hear everything and nothing, you hang around there long enough. I met a young fella over there today had a baby on him. What a pretty girl. That mama would be real proud of that child. That baby don't have a mama. Really? Ain't that strange. Little baby without a mama. Where are you from? Well, I spent my younger years... well, formative years, you might say, downriver a ways with my uncle. So you're from around here. You'd have to douse me with oil and brand me with flames before I ever admit to that. But, yes, I regret to say I am. What do you want for this fine collectible? God, I don't know. A quarter? Sold. Got change for a dollar? Hey, you know what? I really shouldn't sell that. Now hold your horses, honey. Rule number one of the Amerishine salesman is you service your customer, and your customer service will come right back to you. Now, I am a paying customer, and I am prepared to make my purchase. Look, I changed my mind... Well, all right. There you go. And just to show you there are no hard feelings, how about I give something to you? No, no, no. That's all right. Jesus, don't touch me. I didn't mean to get fresh. You got any more? I don't. And I think you'd best be going. Storm's going to pick up tonight. Well, I best get this show on the road then. I'm so sorry, darling. What would Truman do? You gave me life's most beautiful gift. And I squandered it. That child's got to go with its kin, am I right? And I'm that'un's proper caretaker. Don't you worry. I'm going to go get that baby. Truman's going to make it right. Dogs come up with anything? Here you go. Thank you. Tell our baby I said hey. - All right. - Did he find you? Salesman fella. Came by late yesterday asking the way to your place. No. - Where's Hindmarch? - I ain't seen him. You look wrung out, Toker. Calvin! She's over at the house today feeling poorly. Nothing my early demise wouldn't cure. I'm a-coming. What you need? Says it's you she wants. You and the baby. You got a cigarette? You know I give that up. You got any strychnine then? I got to talk to someone. I only hope you'll do. I've had... I've had premonitions. Premonitions that the whole world is going to end tomorrow. Come over you, that sense of evil when you're feeling poorly about your future the way I do about mine. Yessum, I know. You're a young man yet. About evil. What's traveling through your mind, boy? The world's cursed and cruel, that's what Hindmarch says. And what do you say? What do you feel? I can't talk to you neither. Women around here come too simple. They're too full of themselves. You take Josephine Priddy. You try talking to her, you ain't got something between your legs. You won't get no place. Of course, I don't say she ain't got no cause acting like she does. Why is that? Oh... her daddy. Son of a bitch. Sometimes one child gets it. She got it all. He beat that girl silly. Broke her arm one time. I know, because I set it. Oh, Lord. This heat come on me something fierce. Then it's gone. Is it hot in here to you? It's a bit close, ma'am. Come on, baby. Yeah. You might make some woman a good husband someday, you get up out of that hole you're living in, get yourself a haircut. Give her here. If you're ailing... It ain't catching. Never had one I could hold and call my own. Calvin would say I wanted it that way. What has a man ever known? Her mama should have kept her. Can I have her, Raymond? I'll keep her and give her all God gives me, and never look back from this day forward, you let me have her. I'm sorry, ma'am. She's staying with me. Have all that your heart desires, friend? That's your limitation, your cross to bear. Am I right? With Amerishine's 10-point plan, you can achieve whatever goal you put your mind to quickly, effectively and with guaranteed results. The Amerishine salesman knows that the world is full of possibilities... That separates the winners from the losers is having the guts to say "I want this..." Let Amerishine be your guide. Hindmarch! When I came home from Cal's last night after dropping Trout and Wallace off, guess what I found? A girl, must have been around 12, just sitting out there. Said she was looking for her sister. I tried to get her to stay, but run off. Snuck out just before dawn. What is it, Toker? There's the weight of caring for that child pressing down on you. Reminding you of some old pain best left behind. Her mama's dead. I tracked her. You sure? Where? Up Lumbar Cove. The body's hid in an old DeSoto. Way up in the trees. We best call the law and find out who done it. No. The law gets called in here, they'll ask why I got this here baby. They'll think I'm guilty. You know Sheriff Pike. "You have your fun with her first? All you Tokers is the same." He'll lock me up right next to Leroy. And take that baby off your hands and give it to that girl's rightful kin. Find her some kind of family to go to. What'd you do with the body? Nothing yet. Now, you ain't going to call the law, and you left a dead girl's body in the woods? I come by here to ask if you'd help me. Well, no sense wasting any more time then. I got to do something first. I got to go see Josephine Priddy. This ain't no time... I just got to talk with her. Josephine? I... come to say I'm sorry. Yeah, well, try that hangdog look on some other clown. Got any more of that fine coffee? I told you not to bring that mangy-ass thing into my yard. Well, you got a hard heart. You flea-bitten Tokers are all the same: worthless. Always have been, always will be. At least Jess and Handy were smart enough to get clear of this hellhole. You don't know nothing. My brothers run out of here. And Leroy, he just about broke Mama and Daddy's heart. Well, they're the ones who raised up a pack of drunks. They was good folks. They was good, Christian folks. You ask anybody, they'll tell you the same. Word had it the taste for drink ran in the family, Raymond Toker. Word had it that's why you weren't nowhere to be seen that night your brother burnt the house down. You'd have been there, the story might have read different. You got no right! All I want to do is get out of here. Get rid of this. All this. Hightail it out and never look back. Well, you oughtn't to go. The mountains, they hold their own. Damn it. I didn't mean it about your folks. I just get so mad sometimes. Don't know what comes over me. She'll be sitting at a table next week. Not mine. That baby must have been all bloody when you found it. She was smeared a good bit. Not as bad as her mama, though. So is she dead? She was strangled. You know, up in the city they got all kinds of nastiness but not like the special kind we got right here. Who done it? Don't know. Hindmarch is fixing up a coffin. He come by here to get me, we go up Lumbar Cove, give her a proper burial. Looks like you're going to have to name that baby now. Where'd you get this? Hello there, friend. Wondering if you could help me out. I'm... I'm trying to find this young fella, got a baby on him. What you wanting with him? Well, I got a tip up the road a ways that... that's not your own coffin, I hope. I'll start working up there. You want me to take that young'un with me? There you are. She's so stiff and cold. I can't hardly move her. I come to help with that. She's had the baby. Me and the baby, we'd have been kin to each other. Now that Lena's gone, I don't got no kin. I shouldn't say it, because I do got folks. They're not worried that you run off like this? Nope. The bad man come back. This ain't his car. Did you see him? Yeah, honey. I believe I did. I might have carried that faster myself. I've already started digging over there. Is that it? Is that the baby? Can I hold her? All right. Just for a little while. Mama says Lena wasn't supposed to bring a baby under her roof, but Lena wanted you just the same. She told me that one night before we went to sleep. We shared a bed. Mama says you ain't supposed to ask the good Lord why. But I'm gonna ask him. Weren't nothing left to bury Princess Anne but ash and bone. Where's the baby? That girl was holding her. - Girl? - Girl? Oh, girl? Girl? Now you listen to me, girl. You take a look at that baby. Now, we can't leave her no orphan now. Now, now you just... just give her over here. You give her to me. Come on now. You give her over to me. Give her over to me. You're about as dumb as your sister. That's my child. My child will redeem me. You get back, boy! Back off! This child's back where she belongs. Back in her rightful daddy's arms. You stay put, boy! I'll drop to a watery grave before I ever let you have her. I swear, I'll baptize this child before she perishes. You're hurting her! Let go of her! - That baby's mine! - Take her. Take her. Son of a bitch! You check upstairs? I got it all? You got it. I never said you couldn't come, Raymond. You and the baby both. All this land's hard going, but it's home to me. Her too. Can't blame you for wanting more than what's offered. That's a lot. You know it is. Get on with yourself then. Bye, Raymond.
