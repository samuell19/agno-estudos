This is why I'm a dog person. Give up now, Batgirl. You're whipped. That was embarrassing. Especially because you could have just flown above the ice. Huh? Pollen... In the eyes. Super allergy attack. Oh, sorry. When did these guys get so good? I don't know, but we're better. Come on, team. Let's show 'em what we have. Formation partner swap. We're about to ruin your purr-fect score. Maybe, if you can hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Me... Ow. Don't worry about losing, Jess. We still have a lot in common. Like our love of Opposite Direction. That's not all we have in common, Ivy. I do have a green thumb. Well, green everything. Would you look at that? Plants really do like being talked to. Don't talk! Attack! Attack! How about you just cool your heels for a while, Supergirl? Heels? I prefer sneakers. But seriously, your powers are so cool, they almost blow me away. Well, it looks like you four are still undefeated. Only by cheating. They wouldn't have won if they would have stuck to sparring with their original partners. It's called strategy, Cheetah. I'd be happy to loan you some of my books on the subject. It might help during the group sparring matches. Yeah, thanks, but no thanks. There is no fair in fighting, Cheetah. You'd best learn that lesson now before some super-villain decides to teach it to you. Now, shake hands. Hmph. Ivy, are we still down for the Opposite Direction concert? Of course. Should we go after them? Or... I think they need a moment. It was a hard loss. You all did an amazing job. Coach Wildcat is right. Wow, they've really gotten better. Maybe after they calm down, we could take them out for smoothies or something. Great idea, Supergirl. In the meantime, we're going to have to start practicing if we hope to keep our undefeated title. Coach Wildcat, can you reset the sparring room? Does Principal Waller look like a drill instructor? Uh... Eclipso, again? Ugh! Take a hint! Ignored. The only time anyone ever calls me is to be their sidekick. I am not a sidekick! I'm Lena Luthor, the greatest criminal mind of my time! I'm through being a B-list villain. It's time to upgrade my alphabetical standing. It's time to really show the world what I've got! But how? I know. I pinned some really great ideas on Villaintrest. Ooh! Plans to take over the world! I'd forgotten about these. Freeze ray? Boring. Robot army? Meh. Already tried that. Harnessing the power of the Amethyst from Gemworld? Done to death. Ooh! Here's something that could work. Yes, yes! This could be big. Huge even! If I do this, Eclipso, Brainiac, my brother, even those do-gooders at Super Hero High will cower at my villainous might! But I can't do it alone. I need some help. But where? Finding good help is so hard these days. I need cohorts in crime, a legion. What are you smiling at? Don't you have something to wash or clean? If I had only gone to Super Hero High like I wanted to, I could have made some like-minded friends that could help me. Say, that's it! Yes. That will do nicely. Big Building Builders? Yeah. I need something built. How big? About the size of a school. Atlantis? Can you believe it? Sea horse rides, plankton farming. This is once in a lifetime, bucket list type stuff! I just entered on a whim! And I never win anything! Aside from that lifetime supply of toe cream. But really, is that winning? I don't know if I can do this. I'm not sure I'm ready. Why do you think I picked you to be my vice-principal? Uh, hyper-intelligence plus super strength? Not even close. It's because you understand these kids and you know how the school works. You're gonna be great. How will I contact you? You can't. The cell reception underwater is terrible! But you'll be fine. Remember, kids can smell fear so try to stay strong. "Principal Grodd." Hmm. Maybe a little power wouldn't be so bad. Five days of no kids, no schools and no plots to take over the world! Oh, happy day! Oh, happy day! Hi, Principal Waller. Hello, student I don't recognize and goodbye! Enjoy your vacation. No. Make sure the ship gets lost somewhere between Bermuda and the Mariana Trench. Principal Waller, I thought... I was just testing the chair. Don't grovel, Grodd. It's unbecoming. I've decided the trip to Atlantis wouldn't be in the student'' best interest. There is still so much to do around campus. Is there anything I can help with? Yes, there is. Leave. Huh? Today, please. Step one. All right, you know what to do. Oh, you guys missed it! Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and the new Green Lantern put the hurt on Cheetah and her gang during group sparring! It was intense! Both groups lacked discipline. If I were to participate, I doubt anyone would last more than a few minutes. That's a lot of talk from someone whose only superpower is a sword. A sword? This is much more than a sword. It's a... Sword! And you, Fly Girl? You think you'd fare better against me? Think? I know. No one can stop the bodacious Bumblebee! Gee! Maybe you two should see who would win in a competition. Maybe during a game of, I don't know... Hyperfly? - Deal! - Deal! It's almost too easy. Come see the blistering Bumblebee take on the karate-kicking Katana in the match to match all matches! Only five dollars to watch. Wow, this is awesome. How long do these matches usually last? Oh, about half an hour. Huh? Ooh. I admit, you are better than I thought. Does that mean you concede? Hardly. I only thought to give you the chance to surrender before I beat you mercilessly. Bring it on, Can't-ana! Will you make sure you lock up when you leave? Thanks. Often times, you'll be in a position where you'll need to escape an evil doer's insane yet inventive death trap. It takes a sharp mind, patience. And that's why today, we're having a lock quiz. The first person to pick the lock with nothing more than a paper clip passes. What about the others? They fail. That doesn't seem fair. Fair? Try marching through the jungles with 50 pounds of blood, sweat and tears on your back while animals and enemies lie in wait for you to make one fatal mistake! Then you can come back to me and talk about fair! Professor Oberon, are you okay? I'll never be okay. A word of advice, kids. Never join a circus. Never. Join. A circus. Now where was I? Ready, set, go. Huh? Perfect! Well, it looks like we have a winner. Huh? A skeleton key? What? No! That's not mine! I don't tolerate cheating in my class, Catwoman. You think they let you cheat out there in the jungle? But this is just a quiz. Same difference. Report to the principal's office this instant. But it wasn't mine! Mm-mm. Hmph! I guess that means you win, Batgirl. Let that be a lesson, students. Cheaters never prosper. Nothing like a warm shower to start the day. So cold. So cold! Who did this? Why, yes. You are right, Frost. Ice cream is the most important meal of the day. Frost! To the principal's office, now! Huh? So, Wondy. I heard you were made out of mud. So I'm sure you'll be fine eating my dust. Dandruff? Ew! I guess I need to switch up my conditioner. Come around to the starting line! You better not have fleas. Oh! Sorry. Oh, good. Something I'm used to chasing. On your mark, get set, go! Come get me! Come get me! My hair! Ow! Took me long enough. Yes! Who's the best? I am. I am. All right. Get your gear and head to the locker room. Say, um, what do you think is going on with Wonder Woman? I swear, I do not have fleas. Wonder Woman, are you okay? Maybe she decided to take up swimming since she's no good at track. I don't know what happened. My head would not stop itching. Sure. Itching powder? Oh, come on! That doesn't seem like you, Cheetah. - Because it wasn't. - Sure. Tell it to the principal. You know what they say, Cheetahs never prosper. I don't get it. There has to be more to this. Everyone would totally recognize me. Delivery for Supergirl. I'm Supergirl. Ah, sure you are. No, seriously. Can you get her, please? But I am Supergirl! Ma'am, I'm a professional. Everyone knows Supergirl doesn't wear glasses. Huh. Go figure. One second. I'll get her. Oh, hi! You have a delivery for me? Yeah, Supergirl. Just sign right here. "No hard feelings about earlier. "Your friend, Poison Ivy." Aw, that is so sweet! I'm totally going to make her some of Ma Kent's famous organic corn ice cream. She's just the sweetest. Monster plant! Monster plant! It's time for your driver's test, Ms. Lantern. I trust you're ready. I was born ready. Isn't it true humans are born not ready? That is what my creator... Figure of speech, Professor Tornado. Oh, yes. Of course. Ha, ha, ha. So, Ms. Lantern, it is required that in order for you to get your license you must have a vehicle. I do not see yours here. Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. All right. Seatbelts. - Safety first. - Very good. Now, pull out slowly and check for traffic. Supergirl! Too fast. Too fast! Sorry, Prof. My friends need me! Well, at least she left the seat. Oof! Fail. Jessica? Aren't you supposed to be at your driver's test? Yeah. I think I failed. Oh, I'm sorry! It's okay. On the plus side, I still have my pilot's license. Yield. Never. Lucky that thing ain't the hyperfly ball. It was only a matter of time before you lost to me. Unlikely! I was actually using my bad arm to play. If I had used my good arm... Ladies! A little help here! One, two, ha! I'm already in the lead. Lead? You were in the lead. Huh? Whoa! Nice catch! Thanks. Now, what about this plant? Thirty two, thirty three! Wait, I know! Plants need water to survive, right? Right. Oh! I get it. I think it's working. Where there's a wilt, there's a way. Who did this? Um, I thought Poison Ivy was giving me a present, but instead... Ivy, huh? Fifty two! Fifty two! Uh, question. Why am I here? When are you not here? Good point. All of you have been caught breaching the Super Hero High school code of conduct. Enough. None of you have lived up to the potential we hoped for when you arrived. I wonder if this school isn't for you. That's not very funny. Are you kicking us out? I'm not sure. But I suggest you seriously think about if this is the best school for you. Now, dismissed. Just another little push should do the trick. Cheetah, I was just coming to tell Principal Waller. I didn't actually think... Save it, W. You've done enough. Come on, girls! See you later, Ivy? Not really feeling up to it. Maybe another time. They look really angry. You know, maybe they need a hug. Little known fact, I give super hugs. I'm sure you do, Supergirl. But right now, we need to talk to Waller about this. Something strange is going on. Principal Waller, are you here? Yes. Uh... But I'm looking for some very important files. What do you want? We just saw Cheetah, Frost, Poison Ivy and Catwoman coming from your office. And Harley. Yeah, not so weird. All the stuff that's happened today, it's not really like them. We think something else is going on. I understand your concern. Come on, work! But I think we've been indulging the fantasy that they are Super Hero High material for far too long. Ah, there we go. That's a... Um... Unique hairstyle you have there. Oh! Uh, I'm just trying something different. Listen, I'd suggest you girls keep being the do-gooders that you always are, and let me worry about the less than desirable members of our community. They aren't less desirable, they're our friends. If you believe that, I don't think you really knew them at all. Now, if you'll excuse me... Close one. Was that weird for anyone else? I don't know. I kinda thought her hair looked nice. No, I meant the conversation. You don't think she was right about the other girls, do you? No. I believe they're just as good as you or me. Let's go find them and let them know we stand behind them no matter what. I can't believe they thought I'd do something like that. I mean, freezing the pipes? That's so third grade. You gotta admit, it was pretty hysterical! And itching powder! Who does that? I know! Usually a good pepper spray would work. Honestly, they don't make itching powder they way they used to. And to think I need help opening a lock. Or I'd sent a plant to attack a classmate. Or that I'd fill the pool with custard! Oh, never mind. I totally did that. You know what I think? I think it was those popular girls. You know, Supergirl, Batgirl, Wonder Woman. - No, there's no way. - She's probably right. I don't like 'em but I don't think they'd do that. Think about it. You five are the up-and-comers. Who has more to lose when you start beating them at their best drills? We all know they're super competitive. I even heard they cheated during a group sparring match you guys had together. We were winning. I haven't seen you around here. What did you say your name was? Divide. I was new here. - Was? - Yeah. It's obvious that this place is for losers. Yeah, for losers. Ha! Wait. If you aren't going to Super Hero High, where are you going? Haven't you heard? There's a new school in town. Uber High. Uber High? Never heard of it. At Uber High, they're all about letting you be you. Less homework, more fun. I like the sound of that. Yeah, but what about our friends? What about them? As far as I'm concerned, you four are the only friends I'll ever need. Well, what are you waiting for? I think it's time you saw you were missing. Perfect! Let's go! Then I laughed so hard I spit out a hairball. Literally. Where are you guys going? Like you care. Yeah. We know what you four are doing. And we don't have to stay here and take it. You tell 'em, Frosty! Doing? We aren't doing anything. In fact, we were just coming to see if there was anything we could do to help. I know something you can do. What? We're your friends. We'll do anything. Good. Stay out of our way. Uber High? Hmm. Something smells funny. And I intend to find out what it is. Ah, huh? What? It's good for you. There. Uber High actually didn't exist until yesterday. The same day everything started getting weird. It looks like it was funded through several dummy corporations. Can you find the original source? I'm Batgirl. I can find anything. Bingo. LexCorp! Lena's behind this? What does she have against Super Hero High? She still holds a grudge after not being allowed to attend here. So, what? She's getting back at them by stealing students? Hmm, maybe. But I doubt it. Lena never thinks small. The only way we're going to find out what's going on inside that school is to go to the school ourselves. But how? They know we'd never leave Super Hero High. Hmm, we need someone new. Someone that hasn't been here long. Someone... This isn't creepy at all. Can you guys hear me? We hear you loud and clear, Green Lantern. With the com link in your ear and the new Batgirl uplink contacts, you're 555. She's 25? I didn't realize she was that old. Green Lantern, you look great. It's an expression. It means she's perfect. Aw, that's so sweet of you to say. Thanks, Batgirl. Don't be afraid. Green Lantern, you came! Whoa! Well, well, isn't it the newest Green Lantern. What brings you to our new school? Maybe she's tired of being, like, what, the tenth Green Lantern at Super Hero High? Second. Sheesh. So, what is it, GL? Why are you here? Uh... Stay calm. Just tell them you thought that they were right, and they weren't getting a fair shot. Um, I just think you guys were right. Those other girls just think they're so cool, always doing better than everyone else, and... Have you seen Wonder Woman's hair? - Dandruff! - Totally true. Hey! I just want to be somewhere I can figure out who I'm supposed to be without the pressure of those other girls. Well, then, welcome home. Thanks! Well, isn't this lovely. - Who's that? - Principal Taller. She's the headmistress here, and loads more fun than that stick in the mud at Super Hero High. A new recruit? Yes. I... I'm Green Lantern. I just couldn't stand it at the other school. I hope it's okay if I came over? Of course, my dear. The more the merrier. Let me introduce you to our foreign exchange student, Backlash. Backlash, this is Green Lantern. She looks really familiar. - Hi, it's nice to meet you. - You too. Ow! Quite a grip you have there. Oh, sorry. I learned it in weightlifting. Lashina! That's why she looked familiar. Lashina, really? Wow! She should totally wear her hair like that all the time. It looks really great. It really does. Really frames her face. Well, nice to meet you. Well, Green Lantern, you've arrived just in time for your first assignment. Here at Uber High, we tend to do things a bit differently. We're more of a hands-on school, learning through doing. And our first exercise involves helping the good people at Project Cadmus. Cadmus has asked us to do them a favor and test their security. Our task is to infiltrate the compound and find this object. If we're able to obtain the object and return to base without being stopped, you'll have passed. And you'll know that you have the skills to beat the world's best security. So, who's ready for a field trip? Good. Your transportation is waiting outside. Good hunting. Finally, a chance to show what we can really do. Especially without those good two shoes next door getting in the way. All right, the bus is waiting. Let's go! I'm assuming you three will be there to stop this, right? Don't worry, Green Lantern, you can count on us. Fools! By the time these girls figure out I'm using them to steal ancient alien technology, it will be too late for them and the world. Principal Taller is totally using our friends to try and steal that vase! Yes, but why? Maybe for an evil bouquet of flowers? We need to confront them. They're our friends, they'll listen. And tell them what? That their new school isn't for super heroes, it's for supervillains. Magic is about give and take. It's about seeing that which is invisible with the visible. It's also about staying awake in class. I'll fight you! Remember to read chapter 33 on the benefits of toadstools in potions and salads. Dismissed. Except for you two. You both slept in class today and... We slept through our midterm? No! That means... We're failing! I've never failed at anything in my life. Professor Fate! Professor? Pssht. I didn't go through four years of magic school to be called a professor. Not to mention the debt I'm carrying. Oi! Please. Call me Doctor. Doctor Fate, there has to be something we can do to make this up. As much as I hate to agree with Bumblebee, she's right. We'll do anything! Hmm. I see your problem is not sleep but something else. Yes. I will help you help yourself. Follow me. Did you understand any of that? Not a word. Behold, your extra credit. A globe? Not just a globe, but the Globe of Fate. What does the Globe of Fate do? Place your hands on the globe. It looks like... A necklace! Yes, the necklace of Wotan. It has been lost for centuries. I sense this item will not only help you pass your class, but it will also help the school in its time of greatest need. Dramatic much? So, how are we supposed to find it? The globe will show you. No problem. I'll be there and back in no time. You'll be there? I'll be there first and bring it back before you even get close. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! I may have to rethink tenure. Yes, yes, very good. Assemble a team and bring it back to me. It must be powerful if Fate wants it, which means I need it first. Oh, nothing. We're on a field trip. Yeah. I mean, it's going okay. I appreciate you asking. Salmon, maybe with some asparagus. Well, you don't get where I am by eating poorly. Too funny. We're here! All right, ladies! The clock is ticking. Show us what you've got. Ivy. I'll check the perimeter. - Uh, hey, Jack. - Hey, Al. How's it going? Uh, my daughter's got this song stuck in my head. Oh, yeah, which one? Ugh, you know. ♪ Get your cape on And let's take flight ♪ You can do... ♪ Oh, yeah. I hate that song! Perimeter clear of weeds. Good. Come on. So, can you do it? Please! I'm Catwoman. After you. Where are you guys? Whoa! This place is bigger than Giganta's closet. How are we going to find this thing? Split up. Harley, Frost, you take that row. Ivy, Catwoman, take that one. Green Lantern, Backlash and I will take the last one. And ladies, they never said we have to be gentle. Ooh! I was hoping you'd say that. Nope. Not here. Here neither! This is going to take forever. Ooh, look who decided to crash the party. This isn't a party, Harley. You are being used by your new school to commit crimes! Sounds like Supergirl's a little bit jealous that Cadmus asked us to help them and not her. I think you're right, Harley. And what do we do to the jealous types? Smash 'em! Harley, I'm bulletproof. What's a mallet going to do? Distract you. Oh, would you look at that? Beating on Supergirl's totally gonna save us a ton of time! This is kitty-tastic. When was the last time Super Hero High let us out of our cage? You're going to spend a lot of time in a cage if you don't stop what you're doing. Well, isn't it the Doll Knight come to ruin our fun. Don't you have classes you're supposed to be in? Principal Waller frowns on truancy. And the police frown on breaking and entering which you're doing right now. I know breaking and entering. And for that to happen we'd have to not be invited. But we are, and you're in our way. No! You're being used! It's actually Lena who's behind this! Out of the way, Batgirl. Nope! Anything yet? The only thing you're going to find in those boxes is trouble, Cheetah. Wonder woman! Come to try and bring us back so you have someone to play second fiddle? Second fiddle is actually an important part of an orchestra. But, no! That's not what I'm doing. Lena Luthor is using you, all of you, to steal for her! Do you have any proof? Some bank receipts and... Enough talk! This is obviously part of the test. I've got her! Green Lantern, do something. Ooh! Sorry. Here, let me help. Green Lantern, no! This isn't helping. Now, give up quietly or... There! I loves me some capes! Catwoman, heads up! And that's a wrap, team. Back to the bus! Cheetah, don't! Sorry, Blunder Woman. That's called strategy. Maybe I can loan you a book on it sometime. Wonderful. You girls are all getting an A. - Yeah! - Haha, yeah! We work as a team! Yay! That didn't go at all like we planned. You have to admit though, this school must be doing something right because they've gotten way better! What? Is this one of those saying-something non-appropriate times? Sorry. Looks like Katana comes in second place. Again. What? Last one to the entrance is a drone, Bumblebee! Looks like it's hot. Yes. Our last one, I wager. You better believe it. Step back. Let a real woman take a shot. So, when will this real woman appear? Har har. Maybe we need a special word. Some sort of key to unlock the door. Wait, there! What does it say? I only got a C in Ancient Hieroglyphics. A C? I got a C+. It appears to say "Watch out below." Watch out below? That's weird. That was close. Yes. Thank you for saving me. Of course! One to zero, my lead. Look out! - Thanks. - One-one, tied. Obviously, things didn't go so well. But we have a plan. If you can get the girls alone and one by one tell them about Lena owning the school, maybe they'll listen to reason. Uh... Sure. But maybe now isn't the best time for that. We just beat Supergirl! We just beat Wonder Woman. We just beat Batgirl! Whoa! Very impressive. It seems that your short time here has improved your skills dramatically. But here at Uber High, we don't rest on our laurels. No. There is still more to do. Is that... ...the Rock of Eternity? The Rock of Eternity? The Rock of Eternity. And placed deep in the bowels... Bowels? Come on. Bowels? Seriously? It's funny! Bowels! As I was saying, deep in the bowels... In the lair of the ancient wizards sit seven statues. Each statue guards a magical stone which could be dangerous in the wrong hands. Yes, Green Lantern? Um, are you telling me we're going to break into an old, powerful wizard's living room for what? Does he want us to test his security too? Good question. The reality is that we have good intel that suggests the wizard has in fact turned evil. Oh, come on! That can't be true. With these jewels, he will be able to leave the Rock of Eternity and take over the world. But only if you girls let him. But, you know, if you think you need a few more classes on being a hero, rather than just going out and being one, I know a school across town that can help. You can count on us, Principal taller. Can't she, ladies? Good. I knew I could. All right, Uber High. Get going! Cheetah, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. How about in here? Wanted... Wanted... To talk. There's too much interference in the computer room. I can't maintain our connection. We've lost her. Listen, Cheetah, I've been in contact with Wonder Woman, Supergirl and Batgirl this whole time. They were right! This school is bought and paid for by Lena Luthor. We think she's using everyone to get this artifact in order to... Well, we don't know why yet. But generally, you collect ancient artifacts to rule the world. So, my money is on that. So, she was right. - Who was right? - Jessica Cruz. A Green Lantern through and through. You knew? No! You're being brainwashed. You must be. There's no way you'd do this. Cheetah has come to realize that heroism is just another word for sucker. Lena! I knew it! Well, actually Batgirl knew it. But she's super smart, so I totally believed her. Yes. Too clever for your own good. That's right. In fact, my friends are seeing everything that's happening as we speak. They'll go to the authorities and soon, you'll be behind bars. Oh, my dear. I deduced you were working for those super happy fun girls this whole time. In fact, I imagine that you're wearing some sort of com device on your purse in this very minute. An earpiece? Maybe a state of the art contact camera? Why do you think Cheetah led you into this room? There is an electromagnetic field that won't allow any signals in or out. I'm afraid you're on your own. Me? Against you two? You need better odds. We do. Boys. My yellow Kryptomites tend to bring out a lot of fear in people. I imagine a little fear isn't a problem for someone such as yourself. Is it, Green Lantern? I can't see anything. I think... Yes! There's a light at the end of the tunnel! Wow! There it is! The necklace of Wotan! Oh, no, you don't. I'm getting it! Not a chance, Katana. Let me guess, you followed us here. To get the necklace? We're gonna have to fight, aren't we? - I bet I can beat more than you. - You're on! Everyone is staring. Are you sure we're in the right place? Yep. According to my intel this is the stop. We just have to wait here for the S train. Speaking of which... All aboard! How long do you think it takes to get to this rock? In this thing, probably an eternity. I didn't realize it was a bullet train. And they say mass transit is slow. Batgirl, can you hear me? Green Lantern, is that you? We lost you for a while. Are you okay? Sorry, I think something... The connection. It should be better now. Uh, I'm still not getting a camera feed. - Where are you? - At the Rock of Eternity. I've convinced several of the girls Lena is behind it all. If you hurry, we can take her down together. All right! Super beat-down time! Come on, girls. Let's go. We're here. Where are you? Above you. So good of you to join us. Lena! What have you done with Green Lantern? You'll find out soon enough. Backlash! Huh? Cheetah? The door! We really have to start being more careful. You can say that again. We really have to start being more careful. It's just a figure of speech, Supergirl. Oh. Wait, if Lena was impersonating Green Lantern, then where is Green Lantern? Right here. Green Lantern! Are you all right? I think so. Cheetah was helping Lena. She used these Kryptomites. They were coming after me when I must have passed out. Brainwashed. Uh, I don't know. She seemed like Cheetah. Well, except for the whole leading-us-into-a-trap. I'm sure she doesn't know what she's doing. She's not always nice but she'd never turn evil. We'll never know unless we can get out of here. You're right, Jess. It'll take more than a couple of bricks to keep us contained. Supergirl. One hole in the wall coming up! What just happened? The only thing that could stop a punch from Supergirl. Magic. Which would make sense. This whole place is kind of magic central. Couldn't figure that one out before I punched the wall? Sorry. So, what do we do now? Where are they? - We're here. - Where did you guys go? Just taking care of a little unfinished business. Unfinished business? Here? It doesn't matter. What does matter is that the jewels that we are looking for are right there. We just need to retrieve the gems without that old geezer seeing us and we'll have succeeded. ...the dragon. I don't think that'll be a problem. That can't have good lumbar support. If this guy is supposed to be so smart, why is there a giant brick hanging over his head? I think it's symbolic. Really? Looks like granite to me. Shh. We don't want him to hear us. Oh, nature calls. Shouldn't have had that second glass before bed. Hurry, before he returns. Oh! Pardon me. Ooh, unless that was the sound of thunder I think he's gonna be there a while. Ooh, he's actually kind of cute! Come on, Harley. There. That wasn't so hard. Run! Faster! We got what we came for. Now, let's leave. Come on, Backlash! Let's blow this pop stand. Fourteen. Fourteen, 15 and 16. Wait! Katana, look! I'm not so foolish... You just lay down. I'll get 'em! Your blasts are ineffective. I got him. No. I have him. This is your fault! You know, I'm sorry. If I hadn't been so competitive, I would've noticed they stole the necklace. No, it's my fault. Honestly, I'm just trying to keep up with you. You make me a better hero. I think the same of you! What do we do now? I have an idea. Trust me? We're too late. We must return to Doctor Fate and tell him we failed our magic class and the school. - Anything? - Maybe. Magical construction is really quite fascinating. Every brick seems to fit exactly in line with everything else. There's almost no space in between. So what do we do? We make some space. Wait, I thought you just said... You know the rule. Don't interrupt Batgirl when she's genius-ing. When Cheetah closed the door, she must have activated some sort of magical lock. If we can get the door open even a little bit, I bet I can jar the lock and set us free. Supergirl, if you use your freeze breath to contract the brick while Green Lantern creates a crowbar that Wonder Woman will pull with her super strength, it might give us the space we need. So, what do you think? Girls! Okay then. Let's do it. Uh... What are we doing, exactly? Green Lantern. Your turn, Wonder Woman. It's working. Keep going. I can't hold it much longer. One more second. It's slipping! - Did it work? - Listen. You did it! Genius-ing wins again. Can we go home now? Once we find Cheetah and the others. Come on! They're gone! Hey, Batgirl. Didn't your research about the rock of eternity say something about seven statue thingies? They're supposed to be right here. But I don't see them. Wait, there's one. But where are the rest? I've got Pride! Aw, I wanted Pride. All I have is stupid old Envy. I'll take Envy. I can add it to my collection. The sins are influencing us. The longer we stay here the worse it's going to get. Formation mud drop. Go, go! They're coming! - What's wrong? - I'm out of change! Who uses cash anymore? Didn't they give you a transfer? I didn't ask for one. You always ask for a transfer! We'll have to stand and fight. Wait! I can get us out of here. I think. This is gonna be the best thing to come out of this garage in a long time. Huh? I stand corrected. If you've got something up your sleeve, Supergirl, now's the time. Supergirl? There. All right. We should be... Good. Tada! One genetically controlled, dimensional traveling rocketship from Krypton at your service. What about the sins? Here we go. Should have made these steps smaller. Hmm. Nah. Hmm? Yeah! Oh, come on, guys. Work it! I don't know. I mean, I guess I'm having fun. Yeah. Honestly, I kinda miss our friends at Super Hero High. I agree. Where's the challenge? Are you all crazy? We finally get to go out and so something. What? You'd rather be stuck in a classroom while Beast Boy asks stupid questions? - Well... - Maybe. I mean, he is funny. Ugh, you guys disgust me. All right, ladies. It's time for today's final lesson. This ancient device was stolen eons ago, and can now be located in the classroom of one Doctor Fate. Wait. You want us to break into Super Hero High and steal something? I don't know how comfortable I am with that. This doesn't seem like a lesson, Principal Taller. I'm sorry, Frost. When did you get your teaching credential? - No, I... - This will teach you how to finish an objective, and prove once and for all that you are better than your former classmates. Well, can't we do that without having to break into the school? - Yes, we can. - Cheetah. Coach Wildcat is always up for some friendly competition. And I know you guys want to see our friends again. Well, what if we challenge Super Hero High to a sparring match? With everything we've learned, I bet we take down our former classmates in no time. Good thinking, sugar! Yes, I like that idea. What are you doing? While everyone's attention is on the match, no one will be watching Doctor Fate's classroom. Giving someone the opportunity to nab the globe. You really are valedictorian material, Cheetah. Thank you, Principal Taller. Hey! Coach Wildcat is looking for you four. Coach Wildcat? We don't have time for his shenanigans. No. That's perfect. It's time to rope in the teachers. We'll tell him what's going on and he'll get Waller and Grodd. Then we can go to Uber High and get our friends. Great idea. Come on! Oh, thank you, Cyborg! That was nice of you to relay the message. You're welcome, girls. All in a day's work. - Coach Wildcat! - Lena Luthor brainwashed... I'm starving! Girls, where have you been? - Locked in a trap! - Brainwashed! - Fighting monsters! - I'm still hungry! There'll be plenty of time to say whatever it is you want to say later. Right now, Principal Waller has agreed to group sparring match with the girls from Uber High. You don't understand. We... Three, two, one, go! Catwoman, listen! We don't have to fight. Uber High is actually a front for Lena Luthor's nefarious plans. That's just a pile of kitty litter. You're just jealous we're finally getting the respect we deserve! Come on, Wondy, Stand still! Listen, Harley, Lena Luthor is using you guys to steal a bunch of things for... Well, we don't know that part yet. But we don't want to see you guys get into trouble. You have to believe us! Oh, I believe you. You do? Oh, I've known pretty much from the start something was going on. But it sounded like a fun time! Catwoman, you and the other girls are so good at what you do that we have to work really hard just to keep up. You girls make us better heroes. We don't just respect you, we need you. - Really? - Really. You know, you aren't so bad... For a bat. And you're not so terrible for a cat. Leave me alone! - Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tree, really. - No! Are you okay? This is what happens when friends fight. Other people get hurt. You're right. I never wanted to. But there was this girl, and she said you guys hated us. Hated you? I can never hate you! We love you guys, which is why we've been chasing you down all over the globe. We miss you, and we wanna make sure you're okay. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I know, I'm sorry! So, decided to go back over to Super Hero High? If by "decided", you mean Cheetah and Lena Luthor knocked me out and left us for dead in the Rock of Eternity, then yeah! What? You're lying! If I'm lying, where's Cheetah and Principal Taller? You know, you might be right. Let's do this together. What in tarnation are you doing? The match isn't over! There hasn't even been one good knockout yet! Coach, I think we've made a mistake. Yeah. We don't wanna fight our friends anymore. Plus, we think that Principal Taller is actually Lena Luthor in disguise. She's here to steal something from Doctor Fate's classroom. Well, it looks like we might get that knockout after all. What are you waiting for? Go save the day! Yeah, let's go! Yeah! The Globe of Fate! Stop right there! Principal Waller? I... What? Why are you and Cheetah in the magic class? Not that I need to answer to you, Batgirl, but I was showing these girls our facilities, trying to persuade them to re-enroll. Oh, that makes sense. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to continue my tour. I don't buy it! And people say I'm the crazy one! Lena Luthor! They were right! Of course, they were. Annoyingly, they always are. But it's too late. And I'm Lashina! Yeah, we kinda figured. - But the wig! - Meh. Enough! Boys! Keep them back while I finish this. At last. The final piece of my master plan. What? To start a jewelry store? Nothing so mundane. I know she's evil and all... But that is awesome! It is awesome. But not awesome enough. You girls unwittingly helped me steal a series of ancient power supplies that will make me unstoppable. So, what was the vase for? An evil bouquet of flowers, duh! Now... Feel the power of my super mecha-suit! I'd like to thank you for securing your own demise. Demise? Wait! You didn't say anything about that! Oh. Didn't I? Cheetah, are you okay? Is she still brainwashing you? Brainwashing... Uh, yes! I must have been under some sort of mind control! I knew it! We'll fill you in later but for now, we have bigger problems. The power... I can feel it coursing through my veins! Come on, girls! Thank you, Supergirl. I was looking for a little super-strength! My strength! It's... fading! What are you doing? No! Stop! Hold on, Ivy! How chilling. She's absorbing everyone's powers! What can we do? We've all been fighting against each other for so long, we haven't gotten anywhere! What happens when we fight together? Super Hero High School rules on three! One, two, Super Hero High School rules! I have an idea. Follow me! Retreating? So soon? You girls go ahead. We'll distract them. What is that? Is that... Sounds like motors. Who needs superpowers when you've got these? Yahoo! Okay, Frost! Soften her up! Snowballs? Now that Lena has Supergirl's strength, you're gonna need to do better than that. Ivy, grab a hold! What are you doing? Okay, Harley. Do your thing! With pleasure! Pliers, finish her off! All right, team. Let's pull her over! It's over, Lena! Over? It's just beginning. The necklace. Yes! This was the final piece. What is that? The necklace of Wotan. Doctor Fate told us to retrieve it. He said that it was an object of unlimited power, and help the school in its hour of need. Yes. Yes! I can feel it! Wait! What is it doing? Looks like Doctor Fate was right. My strength is returning. So are my powers! Mine too! What? The power of laughter. Well, I guess it's all is well that ends well. Bah! You think I don't have contingencies? Lena Luthor always has a backup plan! Now no longer will we be called Uber High, but the home base for the Legion of Doom! A giant flying ship? - Been there. - Done that. Will do it again. After you. No, no. I insist. - No, please. - Oh, come on! A little friendly competition never hurt no one. That's one for me! One for me too! Me three! You can't hit what you can't see! Huh? What? No! Now, everyone up! Round and round she goes! Where she stops, nobody knows! Shouldn't you girls be in class? Lena? Not this time, lady! No, Supergirl! That's the real Principal Waller! Oh. Sorry. I don't know what's going on butt I want some answers right now! It's my fault, Principal Waller! I was teaching them the virtues of competition here in the open air! But what I found out is that while competition is good, it's not as good as learning to work together. Very well. But from now on, please keep these little sparring matches in the gymnasium. You heard the lady. Who's up for a little group sparring match! Sure. But maybe this time, we'll mix up the teams. That's a great idea! I bet I can make even more off a rematch! I'll take that bet. - Hey! - And I'll take that money! Uh, I was totally gonna give that to you. Honest! Well, that didn't go as planned. What do we do now? What you always do with an empty base. Fill it. Bring me my Rolodex! What's a Rolodex? Never mind. Kids. I'll just log on to Villainbook. I'm sure someone is looking to team up. I can team up. We are teamed up. We need more people. I know people. - Dumb people. - What did you say? I'm doomed! Subtitles by explosiveskull
