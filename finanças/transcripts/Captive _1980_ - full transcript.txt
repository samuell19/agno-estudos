(regal music) (whirring) (gong ringing) (eerie foreboding music) (explosion booming) (eerie music) - This is how a Styrolian does it. (smacking) (eerie music) - Those like myself have no families. - I just can't believe you'd hurt someone you love. - Hold it right there! (thumping) (grunting) (gun firing) (eerie music) - Just find him. Kill him. - You do anything to my sister and you're a dead man! - In history we learned about the last of the 20th century. (engines hissing) (eerie music) (whooshing) - Repeat readout on holding speed. - 28 KKM. - Check. I'm initiating orders to advance to warp speed two in order to monitor turning capabilities. - [Command] Perfect fly by 8-98, at full warp two acknowledge and prepare for additional flight instructions. - Affirmative, command. Advance to warp speed two. (engines whirring) This ship is the most responsive ship I've ever flown. - Awesome. - Tell me something, Stanyo, does it ever bother you that they only used tubers to test fly? - Tubers are expendable, you know that. - At least they give us a little adventure in our lives. - Well, Kalif, I still don't like being considered expendable. - Activate warp speed. (eerie mysterious music) - Approaching warp speed. - Ignition in five seconds. - Four, three, two, one, mark. - Mark, begin sequence one at 4,000 units per second. - 4,000. Four-five. 5,000. Five-five. - Energise. Begin sequence number two at 8000 units. - Affirmative, approaching 8000 units. - Energise. (engines whirring) - Warp two in effect and holding. - Command, this is Styro 8-9-8, ready to receive additional instructions. - [Command] 8-9-8, this is Flight Command. During the next few manoeuvres, activate relay computer system for effectiveness readout. - Affirmative, Command. Stanyo, activate relay computer. (buttons clicking) - Maintain full warp two speed. - Full warp two. (ship whooshing) - [Command] Bank left. - That was too close. - [Command] On my order, bank right 45 degrees. - Standing by, Command. - [Command] Bank right 45 degrees. Excellent, now I want you to try a bank 90 degrees right. (rumbling) - Command, we seem to be having a problem with this 90-degree manoeuvre. - [Command] We observed, 8-98. All right, ease off, ease off. Directly upon descent, report to Operations for debriefing and your new assignments, Command out. - New assignment. How about that? I think we have graduated. Command thinks we must be ready for our first real assignment. - Yes, well, we'll know soon enough. I think I can have it arranged for you to be assigned to the Delta Territory. - Guarding the old people's asteroids? No, thanks. How about Mars or Earth? - Earth. Hm, they have beautiful fighter ships there. - Outmanoeuvring an Earth ship. (suspenseful music) That's my kind of duty. (eerie tense music) - Then the ship refused to respond to the 90-degree turn. - [Operations] Your report appears complete. The computers will analyse your input. Your new orders are effective immediately and are as follows, Stanyo 12, you will report immediately to flight command QD for transport to Mega Vector. Report to Master Commander Villhelm. You are now dismissed. - Yes, sir. - [Operations] Kalif Seven, you are hereby assigned to fly Earth reconnaissance with Space Major Gropper. You will command the mission. No weapons are assigned. Repeat, no weapons are assigned. We're interested in obtaining close-range photographs. Security informs us that a new Earth weaponry base has been established in the southwest quadrant of the continental United States. This mission is vitally important to Styrolia, and it will be security classified. Repeat, security classified. You will discuss it with no one. That is all, Kalif Seven, you are dismissed. - Did you draw Mega Vector, too? - No. - Well? - My mission is a classified one, Stanyo. I'm afraid I can't say anything more. - Classified usually means an Earth flight. - I can't. - I sure wish we were gonna be flying together. - So do I, Stanyo. - So now we fly with the real men. - Well at least we'll be flying. Good luck. - I wish you the same, Kalif. (suspenseful eerie music) (eerie serene music) - Sector three, non-life bearing craft only. And sector five clear. (whooshing) Sector nine clear. - [Star 80] Star 80 to command, Arina, my search screens show no sign of enemy activity. - [Craft Seven] Patrol craft seven to Control Centre, reporting space zone J-19 clear. Repeat, space zone J-1-9 clear. This is patrol seven, end report. - Affirmative, patrol craft seven. (sensors pinging) Space centre confirms a negative activity in J-19. Proceed to space zone K-12, repeat, confirmation of zero activity. Proceed to next designated patrol area, Control out. Patrol craft three, Control Centre ready to receive transmission, go ahead. - God I hate working these night shifts. I get so damn bored. - Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing a little action myself. - Yeah, speaking of which, uh, what are you doing after you get off tonight, Jet? - Going to bed. - Uh, you care for a little company? - Not a chance, one date with you is enough. - Hey, I thought we were pretty compatible. - Well I'm sure, you figure you're com and I'm patable. No thanks. - (laughs) Strike three. - Oh yeah? Well what are you doing after the shift, hotshot? - The usual. - Oh not the laser artillery range again. Man, you got no class. - I have to be ready for anything, you know? - Yeah, but every night? - Alert status must be maintained. There's no room in our forces for lackadaisical attitudes. - My draught board didn't seem to mind. No seriously, look it, why don't we grab a couple of alco six packs. We'll jump in my semigrav and go into the city. She's got 18 dirathium power boosters, she really moves. - Maybe another time. - No really, we'll go in and we'll have a little bite to eat at the Orbit Room and then we'll hit a few pleasure centres on the way back out. - Sorry, not my cup of tea. - What's with you, Rodman? Don't you know how to have any fun? - There's a war going on. Some of us take our responsibilities more seriously than others. - And what the hell is that supposed to mean? - You guys cut it out. Now we've got eight hours to go on this shift and I'm not gonna spend the time listening to another of your stupid arguments. - I'd hardly call being supportive of Earth's position in the Styrolian war stupid. - Oh, here we go again. Another tirade on why we should stand up and cheer for the biggest military blunder of them all. - Blunder, we didn't start the war, they did. - Oh yeah, well I don't see the military geniuses who head operations in any big hurry to end it. Hell, it's been over 20 years. - The enemy's still out there. - You gotta be kidding, Blake. There hasn't been a penetration of Earth's atmosphere in over five years, what's the point? - The point is they could launch a major attack again at any time. - The only thing I've seen on the screen in the last six months is our own patrol craft. Now don't you understand? Styrolia is as sick of fighting as we are, or at least some of us. - Well I'm not lettin' them catch me off guard. I'll be ready for the fight whenever they are. - You career soldiers are a real pain in the-- (alarm beeping) (eerie tense music) - What is it? - Space sentry two's picked something up. Yeah, you can see it now. (beeping) - Read outs indicate the craft is Styrolian. - No it's too hard to tell yet. - Send space sentry two in for a confirmation check. (faint beeping) (sinister music) - Breen, I'm going to run a weapons test. - Negative. - Using that space sentry as a target. - Negative, our instructions state negative. You may be in charge of the assignment but I'm in charge of the Zorian. No weapons fired until I give the command. - [Breen] Gropper, let the tuber have his way. Our turn will come, old timer. - Breen. - Hey if there's gonna be action we'll be in better shape if we change our position. Remember, that sentry has alerted every Earth patrol in the area. I don't like the idea they know right where we are. - So we're in an agreement, evasive flight plan's mandatory. - [Breen] Flight plane adjustment .08. - Mark. - [Breen] Mark, sequence attitude even. - Even, and ignite. (dramatic music) (whooshing) - [Pilot] Tag one to control, intruder ID two Styrolian one-man fighter patrol craft. - Confirmation complete. The two space crafts are one man Styrolian reconnaissance fighters. - What are they up to, anyway? - I don't know, they're on the move now. Send two patrol crafters on Q-73. Tell 'em it's an interceptor alert. - And you'll wanna get ahold of Command Central too, they'll wanna know about this. - All right, hey looks like the night might liven up after all. - Yeah man, you were right, I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it, now just get 'em. - Control Centre calling patrol craft 19 and 26. Interceptor alert, emergency. Proceed to zone Q-73 immediately, repeat, proceed to zone Q-73 immediately. - I remember, (chuckles) tuber, I remember when an entire armada of fighters and space cruisers were attacking the Earth colony. I was commanding a laser garrison on one of the cruisers. They threw every ship they had at us. Nova destroyers, proton bomb launchers, but they couldn't stop us. And I personally had six kills. Let me tell you something tuber, once on a special patrol, four kills with my bare hands. Ah, what a sensation. Warm human blood flowing, firing a furnace of emotion. Oh, tuber, and when you agitate them... It's a strange planet, Earth. Feelings never experienced elsewhere in the galaxy. (engine whirring) And no better feeling than to watch an Earth ship being blasted apart. But now, where are we now? The major attacks, they've ceased. - For good reason. Our economy was in a state of collapse after years of war. - We were annihilating them. We Styrolians would be rulers of this entire quadrant of the galaxy. Now we do nothing. There's no honour left for those of us who led the fight. - There is honour in having served the fleet and having obeyed orders, that is all. The fight, as you call it, exists not for our own purposes but for Styrolia. - (sighs) For me, for veterans like me the fight will continue and nothing will stop it, nothing. - I would hardly refer to this reconnaissance mission as continuing the fight. - True, tuber, but fleet command allowed me to make one slight modification to our flight itinerary. - Modification? (eerie tense music) What modification? - [Gropper] This, tuber. (weapon whirring) (weapon zapping) - Our mission makes no mention of any extra armament. - You don't worry about the mission, tuber. You just fly this ship! (alarm beeping) - Enemy patrol ships approaching, two in number. Sector eight! (eerie whooshing) Activate molecular shields. - [Breen] Star 80 to Zurand, ready! All systems on manual. (beeping) Computer advises attack approach Z-8-4 optimal. - Affirmative. Z-8-4 implementation in effect. Fire boosters on computer count. Four, three, two, one, ignite! (thrusters hissing) - Reverse thrusters, they'll have us in range any second, flight plan adjustment mandatory. React, react! (ships whooshing) Crazy tuber! Our shields won't protect us from a head-on blast! Those Earth ships carry neutron laser rays. (zapping) - Just stay alert to my command to fire those lasers! (ships whooshing) (weapons zapping) - [Gropper] Now it's my turn. (weapons zapping) - I said wait for my command! - No! (ship whooshing) (weapons zapping) (alarm beeping) No, they're malfunctioning. - Overheating due to firing frequency. - It's not my fault. - I'm not saying it's your fault. - It has to be a design flaw. - Take control of the main guns and keep them on automatic range. If they fail, the only thing to blame will be the ship's computer. - All right, what's Breen doing? - He's holding his own. (ship whooshing) (suspenseful music) - [Gropper] We lost contact with 'em. Where'd they go? - I can't see them. - Well, find them! - The scope'll find them. There, sector two. Just give me a minute, we'll be right back on top of 'em! - [Breen] Gropper, I'm right onto 'em, here we go! (explosion booming) I got him Gropper, I got him! - Good, good Breen. How does it feel? - [Breen] Ah, like the old days. Did you see the way that Earth ship blew when I hit it? Oh man (laughs). - Oh my god. - [Man] Just a second sir, what's wrong. - The Styrolians, they just hit one of our interceptors, it just vanished from the screen. - Get a confirmation on that. - I'm trying. - Yes? That's right you heard correctly. Enemy action, looks like we may have suffered a casualty. Yes sir, thank you sir. - It's like I said, there's not a trace left. - Any luck? - Patrol craft 19 and 26, acknowledge! Control Centre calling patrol craft 19 and 26! - [PC-26] This is PC-26 reporting, we've made contact, repeat, contact established. Response is hostile, PC-19 eliminated. How 'bout some help up here? - Patrol Craft 26, this is control. We're doing what we can. Prepare for sentry self-destruct in your zone. - [PC-26] Affirmative and out. (eerie tense music) - Breen, 42 degrees, Breen! (ships whooshing) Breen! (explosion booming) (solemn music) - He slammed into a space sentry. How, how could he have miscalculated? - He did, he miscalculated. - Maintain position, patrol craft 3, maintain position. Potential enemy activity anticipated in all Earth space zones, Control out. - Which of you is Rodman? - I'm Lieutenant Rodman, sir, Operations Coordinator for this sector. - Any further report, Lieutenant? - We've just scored an enemy kill. There remains one more intruder but our interceptor seems to have the upper hand. - Is there any indication of Styrolian activity in any other space zone? - Negative sir, Ensign Hamlin is nevertheless following Fleet command directives and having all patrol craft maintain position in the event of further hostile activity. - Excellent. I want a complete status check on this entire operation in 10 minutes. (ships whooshing) (weapons zapping) - The Earth patrol, they're right on top of us! - Affirmative. (weapons zapping) - They're moving in behind us. What're we gonna do? What? - Outmanoeuvre them. (weapons zapping) (rumbling) - Tuber I, I'm not sure just how much more pounding the molecular shields can take. - The ship is beginning to lose control. We've got only one alternative. - Descend to surface. - Affirmative! I can put this down with your knowledge of Earth's terrain, we have a possibility of survival. (suspenseful music) (ships whooshing) - What's your conclusion? - Well it's hard to say. This computer analysis indicates the remaining Styrolian fighter has extra armaments, but there's no indication that it's been used for more than just a few seconds. - PC-26 reported they observed a variation from the standard Styrolian artillery. - Well if the extra guns do exist, there has to be more than one person aboard that ship to operate it. - No, not necessarily. - It looks like the flight was headed towards the Earth's surface. (beeping) - I'll be damned. The Styrolian is boxing himself in. - Patrol craft 26 reporting in sir. - [PC-26] PC-26 calling Control Centre. - Go ahead PC-26, this is General Elsiner, we're with you. - [PC-26] We've got 'em on the run, General. Once they're within surface support's range, they won't get away. - Good job Captain, Control out. Alert surface support. I want three proton launchers airborne now. - Yes, sir. This is Control, give me ground support. (crickets chirping) (laughing) - Okay, okay, okay, that's enough. Ooh! - Oh did I tell you we had a good day at school! In history we learned about the last of the 20th century. You know, the things Grandpa talks about! - Goodnight, Cindy. - Did you know Marissa got one of those auto-canaries? It sings, but I love Cleo, you know. - Goodnight, Cindy. - I love you, you're a great sister. - I love you too, honey. Now go to sleep. Cindy sure is growing up. You know, Grandpa even after all these years I still find myself missing mom and dad. I don't know, maybe it's because this place never changes. Same furniture, same everything. The world keeps changing, but the farm remains exactly as if mom and dad were still here. - It was this way when I grew up here. When my daddy grew up, all the way back to my great grandfather, Luke Carter. It's his family's home place, always has been, always will be. - Grandpa, I've been thinking, ever since they died and we had to raise Jimmy and Cindy and somebody had to do the housework and, and look out after everyone and, well-- - Say what you're thinking girl. - Oh, how do I say it? I'd like to find someone. I'd like a home of my own. - Hm, been wondering when you'd be bringing this up. - It's just that night after night I sit here after the kids have gone to bed and I just have these feelings. - [Grandpa] We feel what we feel. - But Grandpa, a time comes when people have to let go of certain, of certain ways of living! Don't you see, the hate you hold inside you is going to destroy you! Do you want the kids to grow up unhappy like you? You can't keep protecting them from this world! - This modern world of yours killed my son! Your daddy, killed your mama, that's not something I want for you kids. - You know, I've discovered something. I can hold on to the love of mom and dad without hating this world. - Maybe you can, but not me. - No, it's the same for everybody! Sure there are some that refuse to let go of their hate, but that hate eventually consumes them in the same way it's consuming you! - Now you listen to me! I've been on this earth a good deal longer than you have young woman! There was a time before when this world was a good place to live for everyone! But the politicians, the corporations decided that what was out there was more important than what we had down here. The results, aside from a few farms like our own, which I've done my damnedest to maintain the way a farm should be, the world is one long endless war, grabbing up all the resources, to keep up with your world! People don't know the smell of green grass in the spring. The feel of cool dirt between their toes. All they want is the newest, shiniest, and fastest, whatever it takes to satisfy them. - [Woman] That's not the important part. - Oh it isn't? What do you think it is that makes everything work in today's society? Runs those air surface cars, runs all the gadgets in every city around this world? Dirathium, that's what. - What's the got to do with it? - I'll tell you what it has to do with it. It's Dirathium crystals that Earth has been fighting about with those damn Styrolian monsters all these years! You say it has no part in our lives. I remember the day those Styrolians came flying across our land, burning nearly all of it out with those Dirathium rays. I remember seeing your mama and daddy out the fields when it happened. I told myself I'd never forget, as long as I live, I'd look on this world is a lost cause. As for those Styrolians, well I could kill... No, enough of that, time for bed. Four a.m. still comes early. - Goodnight, Grandpa. - All the animals are locked up and watered. I left Matt and Blaze in the lower pasture, okay? - Fine. - Grandpa gone to bed? - A few minutes ago. - Heard you and him arguing, I'd never heard so many words out of his mouth. Is it okay if me and Vicious go out to the pond for a few minutes? - Well it is kind of late. - Oh please, you just gotta let me! - Well, what on earth is that? - It's an atom polarizer, I made the money selling frog legs to send away for it. - Does grandpa know about this? - Are you kidding, he'd skin me alive! Put these wires in the water like this and push here, and zap, any frog within five metres gets fried! - Jimmy, how could you do such a thing? - Oh please, you just gotta let me. - Well, it's been a while since we had frog legs. - Great, come on Vicious we've got things to do! Come on Vicious! - Don't forget to lock up! - Don't worry. (crickets chirping) (frogs croaking) (tense music) (weapons zapping) - It's no use, we'll just have to cope with the ship's environmental system as it is. - A few more revolutions and maybe, maybe, damn! You'd think this ship was Earth-made! - Even if we could make the system work, the hull of these reconnaissance vessels were never designed for this kind of speed. - And especially in Earth's atmosphere, but we have no choice. (engine whirring) - Put enough distance between us and the Earth patrol. We're out of their laser range. Let's hope we don't burn up. (rumbling) - Tuber, the hull's gonna separate! We have to adjust our flight plan immediately. - [Kalif] Agreement, I'll let the ship fall into Earth's gravitational pull. (weapons zapping) (eerie tense music) (rattling) - Earth patrols. - We've lost scanner contact, they're too close to the ground. - Any sighting yet, Commander? - [Commander] Not yet sir, it's pretty black out here. We're making a surface sweep based on last coordinates of (mumbles), they'll turn up sooner or later, Surface Support out. - See if you can raise the patrol craft. - Patrol craft 26, this is Control, come in 26. - [PC-26] This is PC-26, Control. - Can you give us your position? - [PC-26] Not a chance, lost track of my flight plane when they moved down here. Can't talk any longer, they just pulled up behind me. 26 out. (engines whirring) (eerie tense music) - (laughs) You're staying in pursuit? - I have no choice. Any attempt to reverse direction and climb back would be useless. - Well they're going to pay, tuber, they are going to pay. (ships whooshing) Pull up tuber, pull up! - Guidance system is knocked out, we're forced to stay on manual! All we can do his run. - Won't be running too far if you keep flying at this low altitude. - I've a slight lead on them. (tense music) One last alternative. - Tell me what you want. - Supercharge laser batteries! - No! - Do it! (frenetic beeping) - Batteries charging. - Good. - Know what you're gonna have to do? You're gonna have to completely reverse flight direction, if this blast is gonna work. - Agreement, but I think I've found just the place... (ships whooshing) On command shut down all the interior and exterior lights. Computer ready. - Start firing status. - On computer ready. (ships whooshing) (tense music) Now! (weapons zapping) (explosion booming) (crickets chirping) (frogs croaking) - Hear that Vicious, it sounded like thunder, but it couldn't have been thunder, it's a clear night. Hey there's a big one, okay... - I got him! - (mumbles) panels won't respond, activate emergency power! - Activated. (eerie suspenseful music) - That wasn't thunder, I could have sworn I-- (explosion booming) Hey, did you see that? Come on vicious, let's take a look! (electricity sizzling) (engine whirring) - Gropper! Gropper, Gropper, we have to get out of here! Gropper! (grunting) - What happened? Kalif, what, what happened? - The ship's destroyed. - Destroyed, the ship, is destroyed? Is it irreparable? - See for yourself. (crickets chirping) (groaning) - Stuck here on this forsaken planet Earth, without a ship! Captive! - We'll figure something out. Now don't move, I'll take care of it. (spray hissing) (sizzling) (crickets chirping) You'll be all right, by now the Earth Control must have alerted their ground forces. - Or else they could have spotted the crash. - We're too exposed here. We should move to a safer place. (groaning) (electrical crackling) (steam hissing) - [Man] Sensor relays have indicated radioactivity fallout in the coastal mountain vicinity. - What about visual contact? - PL-59, which was in the area reported sighting a faint flash on the horizon, nothing more. - All right, continue a surface sweep until ground search is in the area. - [PL-58] Yes sir, PL-58 out. - God dammit! How the hell'd they get by us? How'd we lose 'em? Try reaching the patrol craft again. - General, you don't understand, it's not as if he's simply not answering. When I make the call my indicator level shows zero response activity. Now that would only happen if the-- - If the ship had blown up, I know that! I know that, just try again anyway. - Yes sir! (sensors beeping) - That analysis just confirmed the nature to fall out, it correlates exactly with the dirathium fuel amounts onboard PC-26. That flash must have been the ship exploding. (tense music) - All right. - Captain Warner is on his way over here now sir, he's the best search squadron leader we've got. He'll find that Styrolian whether he's dead or alive. - Come on Vicious, come on. (Vicious growling) What is it Vicious, what is it, boy? (eerie sinister music) No, don't shoot, no! (weapon zapping) Vicious, Vicious, what happened, what did you do? Why? - No! The earthling may be useful to us. - Tuber, he can identify us. He must be terminated. - He can lead us to that structure in the distance. It must be his living cubical, at least there we can think of what we're gonna do next. Besides, we need nutritional supplies. - Will you convince the earthling to cooperate or he'll be terminated? - You're Styrolians! - If you plan on staying alive, you'll drop that light. My comrade has very little tolerance. I mean now! - Should you further annoy or irritate me there will be instant termination. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - Now lead us out of here. - [Jim] Yes sir. (eerie sinister music) (crickets chirping) - Shh! Wow. (door clattering) (weapon zapping) (door clattering) Do not be afraid and do exactly as I tell you. Get yourself and the young one into the other room. (crickets chirping) Sit! Gropper! Gropper! - Hold it! - Grandpa! Grandpa! (thumping) (gun firing) Grandpa! (eerie tense music) (Kalif groaning) - How is it? - I'm all all right. Don't hurt them Gropper, we need them. - You, woman! That cord, bring it, and tie the old one. (tense music) - Help, Styrolians, please help us, please anybody help us, oh (groans). (woman whimpering) (crunching) (thumping) (clattering) - No more communication. (eerie sinister music) You, put the old one in the chair. (Grandpa grunting) - Don't kill him! - Put the noose around his neck. (sobbing) (whimpering) - Don't hurt him! - Put it, put it around his neck. - Please don't hurt him! - You need motivation. Now, tighten it. - Please don't hurt him, I'll do anything you want. - Yes, you will. You, back! - Don't hurt her! - Stay back! Tighten it. Oh that's not tight enough. (grunting) Really tighten it up, tighten it! (Grandpa choking) You're no match for me old one! Right old one! - [Cindy] Stop hurting my grandpa! Stop hurting my grandpa! - Please don't kill her! Please don't hurt us! (chuckling) - If I kill, oh I'd kill all of you, no witnesses... - (groans) Gropper! - How's the arm? - It's all right. - You and you, find him a place to rest. - Untie the boy outside and bring him in. - [Gropper] When I secure the old man. Well help him, help him girl! You in the back help him, help him! (sensors beeping) - Captain Martin Warner reporting sir. - At ease captain, step over here will 'ya? Marty, this is the last area that we had verified contact with our patrol craft. Commander Copis is keeping a surface watch but so far he hasn't turned up anything. - Have there been any more computer readings from the general vicinity? - There was a slight detection of seismic movement shortly after our ship blew up. - Then possibly, just possibly the Styrolian crash-landed. - Possibly, but to create even the slight ground disturbance that was picked up would have required one hell of an impact. Chances are better that it was caused by delayed aftershock after PC-26 exploded. - Have you been able to pinpoint the area where this seismic activity took place? - Let me check. Are you done yet with the cross-indexing Lieutenant Woodbury? - Just finished. The seismic indicators show that the source of the ground disturbance is within a hundred square mile area, about here. - Then that's where we should begin. Any further orders general? - Just find him. Kill him. I want this operation wrapped up. (crickets chirping) (tense music) - Well. How is he? - Your friend needs help. What have you done with Jimmy? - Jimmy, what is Jimmy? - My brother the boy. - Boy? Oh the young thing, he's safe enough don't worry about him. You help me with my tuber. Here, uh... (Kalif groaning) Let's see this... (spray hissing) (screaming) What's wrong? - There's something burning inside my shoulder! - Well a high compression microwave shouldn't have any side effects. Tell me, what the weapon, the old man used, what was it? - A shotgun. - A shot gun. And what does it do, what does it do? What is the explosion, what does it consist of, what? - Small metal pellets. - Small metal... - Do not use the sprayer it must raise the temperature of the pellets! - Small metal pellets. Tuber, I cannot heal your shoulder. Keep away! - The wound should be cleaned. - It hurts, let her clean it! - You don't understand tuber! - Let her help! - Help. - I need some water and some antiseptic pads. - [Gropper] Get it, get it! (eerie sinister music) (crickets chirping) (woman whimpering) (dish clanking) (woman weeping) (groaning) - The pellets should be removed. I-I've never done this before! Oh, I'll clean the wound, keep it from getting infected. This will sting-- - Wait! I want to know, what is that? - Whiskey. - This, whiskey? - Whiskey, take it-- - No! No, you we're going to poison him. - Why no-- - Yes you were going to poison him! - It won't hurt him, it'll help him! - Cleaning and bandaging is enough! Get on with it, on with it! I'm going outside to get the boy, if anything happens to him while I'm gone, the boy will be terminated. Do you understand? - I understand. - Somehow I knew you would. (crickets chirping) Small pellets which become embedded in its targets, ridiculous. Now what could I try it on? Hey where are you going? - Just want to make sure Cleo is okay. - Cleo, what's a Cleo? - It's my pet canary. - Don't you think Cleo would like to, (Cleo chirping) fly about the room? Enjoy some freedom? - Well I guess so but Janet told me not to let her out of her cage. - And you wouldn't dare disobey Janet, would she old one? Do you know what I would do if someone disobeyed me? Hmm? - Don't let them hurt Cleo, Grandpa! (eerie sinister music) (gun firing) (window shattering) - No! He killed Cleo! Janet why? - What's going on Gropper? - Gathering intelligence tuber. Studying the effect of this rather primitive weapon, demonstrating a point, that their weapons are inefficient, undependable. Your shoulder's bleeding. - Get the boy. - You're undependable. I want that shoulder repaired! And that's an order! Old one, we haven't finished yet, you and I. (suspenseful music) - No, we haven't finished yet. (crickets chirping) - Janet? - Yes dear? - I miss Cleo. - I do too honey. Try to get some rest. - [Kalif] Is the young one yours? - My sister. - Sister? - Your shoulder needs attention. - [Kalif] Your sister, tell me what you feel about her, I want to know. - Well naturally I love her very much, something you wouldn't understand. - These are feelings I've never seen before. - It hurts doesn't it? - [Kalif] Yes, but I trust you. (tense music) - I couldn't let you bleed to death. - You have much compassion. I am sorry if any harm has come to either you or your family. - That's hard to believe! You broke into my home, you pointed a gun at us. If you feel so badly about it, why did you do it? - We're trying to survive in a strange world. If Gropper has done anything to harm you or your family, it is unfortunate. But in view of what has happened to me, there was little that could be done. I am sorry. - I'm sorry too. - In our world when one does harm to another it is automatically expected that they will be terminated. No matter who they may be. - Do you mean that (eerie tense music) if your mother and father did something wrong you'd bring harm to them? - I cannot answer that question. - Why not? - I never had a mother or a father. (poignant music) - What? - I was artificially created in a test tube. I was raised in a nurturing centre. I never had a mother or a father. I have no concept of parents, or parents and children, or sisters. Therefore I cannot answer that question. - So that's why you were asking me about my sister. - That is why. - I just can't believe you would bring harm to someone you love. - Those like me have no families. We are not permitted to inter-relate on any level of Styrolian society. We are raised in a computerised technology until mature, then we become soldiers living a life of obedience. I am a tuber, that is all. - Do you have a name? - [Kalif] Yes, I have a name. - What is it? - Kalif. - Kalif. Kalif, I am also a tuber. - Then how can you, be sisters? - Often in our world when a man and woman want a child but can't have one, because of some physical problem, a child is created from a test tube. That child is raised as though it were their own. - Why do they love it? (sighing) - Because of love! - Love... What is this concept, love? (clattering) (thumping) (eerie sinister music) - Get up! - Go to hell! - Hey! How long, how high can I pull him before his arms break, huh? - [Janet] Stop it! (smacking) (grunting) Now, come here, come here! Now Grandpa, why aren't you laughing? That's what she called you isn't it, Grandpa? Why aren't you laughing? I want you to laugh, or he dies! - Gropper let him go! I said don't hurt them, we may need them! Come in here, we need to discuss our plans. - You stay. - I still say our best alternative is to move on at first light. - No. We'd be too exposed, it's safer here. - We're too close to where the ship exploded. The Earth Patrol is bound to check this house. - [Gropper] It would be to our benefit. - How can that be? - [Gropper] They check this place, we terminate them, we take their vehicles. - [Kalif] We have no idea as to how many troops they'll send. - It can't be more than four or five. It's too large an area to search. - It is worth considering. - You okay Grandpa? - Hmm. Just watch out for yourself son, I'm real proud at how you handled things. - They killed Vicious, the mean guy did it! - [Janet] Vicious is dead? - Yeah. - No talking! - Stick it! - In view of your condition, to move is impossible. If you die tuber, die like a soldier. (eerie music) No conversation, no talking! I'll explain, don't even think. - See the gun, there? - It's unnecessary! These people may be different from us, but they don't deserve this kind of treatment! - [Gropper] We'll probably die anyway, tuber, so why not enjoy ourselves? - I can't get it without him seeing me. - [Jim] I'll try kicking it under the couch. - You seem to be forgetting fundamental orders. A basic tenet for each fleet commander in flight training is never to harm one's adversary unnecessarily, especially when they're civilians! Now I don't need to explain to you why that rule exists, do I? - I know why tuber, unnecessary harm to one's enemy, provides a motivation to retaliate which may not have existed before, something like that. Hmm? Though I see little to fear in retaliation from these creatures. - I suggest we reconsider this after we've had some rest. - Tuber I have nothing further to discuss with you. Nothing. I need you, if only to get off this planet, so let's take a look at that shoulder. Not bad, I'll look at it later. (eerie tense music) - [Janet] I think he's coming. - [Jim] Get it later. - Remember I don't want them harmed! - Oh yes sir, mighty humanitarian! No more violence! What are you doing, hmm? I thought I told you not to move! - Stop it he can't breathe! - I'll stop it, (Cindy weeping) only because of you. (mumbling), live a little longer. Now we sleep. You, will leave the room and take care of my tuber. And shut that young thing up! You stay here, you boy on the couch! Move! - [Cindy] Janet, Janet, I'm scared! (eerie sinister music) - Shut up, shut her up! She bothers me. (crickets chirping) (birds chirping) (rooster crowing) - Oh I've got to check Grandpa and Jimmy. - I checked, they're okay. (sighing) - (sighs) I have to feed the animals. Would you... I mean, do you feel well enough to go along with me? (sighing) - It's sore but, Gropper would never let you go by yourself. - Crazy. You're both so different. - Yes. - Cindy you like to come too? - I'm scared. - Go back to sleep. But if you do get up, stay in the room, and don't make any noise. - Okay. - Turn your head I want to change my clothes. (enigmatic music) - Hey, where are you going? (eerie sinister music) - The horses have to be watered and the animals have to be fed. - Why? - I'm going with her Gropper. Besides I need some fresh air, and we may need their animals. - [Gropper] Go. (sighing) - It feels so good to be outside, away from him. - It's so very different here. Why is part of that mountain so green and the other part so barren? - Years ago when the war with your people was much larger, a tremendous air battle took place over those hills. The hills were seared with laser bombs, from you attacking Styrolians. - A few were responsible for the hurt of so many, our people as well as yours. The ones who want it the least are usually the people who are hurt the most. - I'm happy that you and your family were not harmed by the fighting that took place here. - My mother and father were killed. - [Kalif] I've been very confused about the meaning of parents, but in the short time I've been here I've come to learn that there exists a strong bond between members of a family unit. And although I don't completely understand the significance of it, I do sense the depth of it. (birds chirping) (enigmatic music) - [Janet] We're just as responsible for the death and destruction during this war. No conflict lasts so many years unless both sides are unwilling to compromise. But enough about war, tell me, what was it like to live on Styrolia? - As children, a teacher, companion, sometimes dictator, sometimes friend, is a computer. But mostly the computer is our standard of how to live. The only people we ever meet are the young ones we grow up with. But then we're taught not to become attached to them. (eerie poignant music) (horses neighing) - Here we grow as individuals, learning from each other. And as we grow closer together, we become more aware of each other's feelings. - I think I'm beginning to understand. But what of this concept, love? - Since life began on this planet people have tried to explain love, with not much success. - What's that? - Oats. - Oats? - It's what the horses eat. - Why don't you use androids or robots to do these mundane kind of jobs? - (sighs) The whole point of living this lifestyle is to stay in touch with nature! Come on, let's go feed the chickens. Okay, you can have more. (Janet laughing) (eerie poignant music) - What a curious animal. It's fascinating how they all stay together in one group like that. - You know, a couple of nights ago a mother hen died. Her brood was adopted by another hen, and she instinctively began caring for the motherless chicks just like her own. Kalif, it's the same with people. You see once there's a sense of caring between two people, love begins to grow. That's what you saw with Cindy and myself. And that feeling exists between parent and child. Whether the child is created naturally, or through a test tube. That feeling is love. (eerie poignant music) You don't have to say a thing. (eerie sinister music) - What are you looking at old one? Show me! Oh (chuckles). That's it. Well. (poignant music) (chuckling) That's it. That damn tuber. You know something old one, I didn't think he had it in him. But wait till my turn comes! (grunting) (laughing) (power humming) (sensors beeping) (tense music) - [SQ-4] Search Quadrant four calling Control, Search Quadrant four calling! - This is Control, Squadron four. - [SQ-4] Enemy vessel located at 3,000 feet elevation, in mountain region 18. - Any sign of the pilot? - [SQ-4] Negative. The escape hatch was open and the vehicle empty. Judging from the condition of the wreckage, he must have been injured. He couldn't have gotten too far. - Consolidate forces and saturate the area! - [SQ-4] Well regrouping's already taking place. Odds are he's moved to lower ground, so we'll be concentrating personnel to the north. - Fine, just keep us posted. - Yes sir. Squadron four out. - Get our boys over at Security Analysis. I want a search team on that site in an hour. (birds chirping) - Well I presumed you took care of the animals. - For now yes. - Well that's good. Now it's my turn. You stand watch. Grandpa, I'm going to check the animals now. - No Groppa. - Yes. - I said no. - Well all right tuber, if that's what you want. (fist thumping) (eerie sinister music) (weeping) Don't worry about him. I mean, anything you experienced with a tuber like that, is nothing compared to what you're gonna experience with me. Come here... - No, oh please don't! - That's what I like, someone with spirit! (Janet whimpering) Spirit, right Grandpa? I tell you what Grandpa, I'll tell you all about it when I'm finished! (laughing) (clothing ripping) (Janet whimpering) - You do anything to my sister and you're a dead man! Cindy, Cindy come quick! - Where's Janet? What happened to Kalif? - Never mind, just get me a knife, scissors, anything, just get me out of these ropes! (eerie sinister music) (Janet screaming) Hurry just cut it, hurry! - Dammit cry! This is how a Styrolian does it! (smacking) - Good Jim! Jim, my ropes, cut me out of 'em! - No time, I gotta help Janet! Get him out of his ropes! - Cindy come on, that's it! (smacking) (whimpering) - That was fun... - No, no, no... - Yeah, Styrolian style, that's what I like! Come on, you're missing the best part! - Stop! Keep away from my sister. Stop now or I'll shoot. Stop or I'll shoot! (birds chirping) (eerie sinister music) (clicking) - [Gropper] I'd kill you right here, (groaning) but I think grandpa might enjoy watching. Hey grandpa, you want to witness an execution? - You'll pay, you'll pay! Now it's my turn! (gun firing) (Gropper groaning) - Since I didn't want to shoot Janet, I waited until he was away from her. I distracted him all right! I almost had him right then and there! But like I told you the gun didn't work. Finally he had me pinned down and was ready to kill me and-- - Janet, come look! - [Janet] Just tell me what you see honey. - There's two guys sneaking outside the house, I could see them from the bedroom too. - She's right, as far as I can see it's an Earth Tactical Search Unit. I bet you they found the ship. - Jim, take Kalif into Grandpa's bedroom and get him into a pair of dungarees and a work shirt. - Okay, come on. - Go ahead, it's gonna be all right. Grandfather, I know we haven't always agreed with each other, but, but please, please don't, don't turn Kalif in, please? - I'm Captain Warner, I'm looking for a Styrolian. We found the remains of his ship up on the hill. We assumed he escaped. Do any of you have any information about him? - Yep in fact, Kal over there had his head busted in by him, (chuckles), but we took care of that old boy. You'll find what's left of him outside in back of the wood bin. - Captain we found him behind the house shot full of holes. - We want to thank you. - Oh that's all right just haul his carcass away from here, that'll be thanks enough. Now if you don't mind, we've had enough excitement here for one day. - We'll contact you later if we need to. - Oh thank you grandpa, thank you. - Now don't ask me why I didn't turn him in. It's very simple. The love I saw in your eyes, reminded me of the look your mama used to give your daddy. Besides, I could use an extra hand here on the farm. (chuckling) - Yes, I understand Major, thank you. (eerie tense music) Well, looks like you were right Lieutenant. - It was only logical. - When I heard about the-- - Captain Warner is calling in! The Styrolian pilot, they found him. - This is Elsiner! I hear you got good news Marty! - [Marty] That's right general, we found the alien, he was already dead. It seems this backwoods farm family had terminated him. - What about the other one? - [Marty] Another one, I, I don't know what you mean sir. - Security Analysis just called in the report from the crash site, there were two enemy personnel on board at the time of the crash. - [Marty] Well if there is another one out here, I'll get him sir. - I'm sure you will. Control out. (waves splashing) (birds chirping) (pleasant music) (thumping) (laughing) (birds chirping) (serene music) - Earth, so much different than I expected. So informal, simple. - Well, don't judge all of Earth by what you see here at our ranch. By most standards ours is judged as an old-fashioned lifestyle. - I'm not complaining, I like it. And the people who live it. - Well if you went to one of the big cities you might change your mind, the people there all act as if they're out of some kind of an assembly line. - Assembly line? - Yeah, you know, stamped from the same cookie cutter. - Cookie cutter? - Uh, from the same mould. - Oh you mean like on Styrolia, where people are born, raised and educated on an assembly line. - Well, I prefer you to most Earth people I've known. - And I prefer you. - Well, let's drink to our preferences. (serene music) (birds chirping) (brooding music) - The old man's not here, nor is anyone else. - Do we wait for them or search the area? - I say we search. Captain Warner's report indicated four persons living here. An old man, a young adult female and two children. The neighbours to the east indicate that there's an adult male here. They say he's been here about a month and a half, described as about five foot, 11, maybe thirty years of age, so what do you think? - Captain Warner also reported seeing a male farmhand here. - Did he check his papers? - No I don't think so. - It must be our Styrolian, it all fits. They found one dead but intelligence report indicates that there was two of 'em, so there's one missing. - [Man] And suddenly a new man appears on this ranch. - Right. Okay if he's not in the house, he's certainly in the area. You check out the house again, - Okay. - I'm gonna radio Command. This is search team Omega calling Command. Request search team Alpha, group at vector 79A. - Lieutenant, look at this. - Let's go. (tense music) - Take it easy Grandpa! - What is it Grandfather? What's wrong? - Federation Patrol security! - Where? - At the house. I just saw them, heard them. They're looking for you Kal, they know you're here. - Oh my god! - What do we do now? - I've got to get you away from her son, the sooner the better. They're searching the area. I heard them call up another team to help them. I don't know where they are now or where they're going. You can't go back to the house because they probably have a guard there. I think you'll have to head into the countryside. - What about provisions, weapons? - We'll make do with what we have. I'm praying we don't have to use weapons. - We can't send Kalif off by himself, he doesn't know the area! - Listen to me girl, we have no other choice now, he can't stay here. He could be arrested and maybe killed. How 'bout you Kal, what do you think, any ideas? - Are there any civilian air shuttle bases in this area? - About five miles east of here. - If I can get to a ship, any ship that can fly, I might stand a chance. Will you lead me? - Let's go! (suspenseful music) (footsteps clattering) - [Man] What do you think? - I think they've been here just a short time ago. This way. (tense music) (suspenseful music) - He's out there alone? - No I don't think so. Looks to me like the old man was covering for Styrolians, deliberately, whether he did it on his own or was forced to, I don't know. We're just wasting time, he's probably not alone. Alpha Team, you take the low ground, form a 40 degree sweep northeast of the ranch. Gilbert and I will take the Southwest sector. Get these things, set up a laser fence, form a circle around the quadrant. Hit it. (tense music) (panting) (eerie suspenseful music) - Come on, hurry! (weapons zapping) Ha! - No! Fire only when you know you can hit him! I don't want the family hit! - Yes sir. - Circle around to the right and sweep the area, report in every five minutes. - Okay. (tense music) (suspenseful music) (weapons zapping) - Back, back, back! We gotta keep moving, we're like sitting ducks out here! (weapons zapping) (grunting) I know what you're trying to do! But hunting tricks don't change through the years (chuckles). Come on we'll go back to the other way, follow me! (weapons zapping) - Oh! It's all right, keep going! - Okay! - I'm all right! (eerie tense music) - Hold it, wait! (energy buzzing) It's a laser fence! We're boxed in! Wait right here, just relax, I'll see if I can find a way through it! (tense music) (energy buzzing) (energetic relentless music) - Hey you're running over my friend. Stand up! I said stand up! (suspenseful music) Put your hands behind you, turn around! Turn around! That's it, back up! - Okay sonny, nice and easy, let go of the laser gun! That's it! Here Kal, take the gun! All right, down on your knees, nice and slow. That's it, give me the rope. You got it on him? Okay that's it behind your back, that's a good boy. - I'm not gonna kill you. Your comrades will find you soon, and when they do I want you to give them this message. Do not hurt this Earth family! what they did for me they did out of love and gratitude. If they broke any of your laws, it was my doing, not theirs. (weapon zapping) - And you won't be needing this anymore. Come on, let's go. (tense music) How's the leg? - I've been hurt worse. - Well it's gonna slow you down. Look, I'm gonna use myself as a decoy, that'll give you the extra time you'll need. - I can't let you do that, you may get shot. - Don't worry about me Kal, I can take care of myself in these parts. I wish I had all the time to tell you how much you've come to mean to me son. - And you to me. Janet. (weeping) (poignant music) - I'm going with Kalif! - No. Stay with your family. The children need you. - But I-- - He's right Janet. And it's too dangerous out there for you. (sobbing) Now look, you go on back to the ranch now. Come on, he'll be back, I know it. As soon as there's peace again he'll be back. Come on, now go on now. Hurry. (poignant music) (eerie foreboding music) (suspenseful climactic music)
