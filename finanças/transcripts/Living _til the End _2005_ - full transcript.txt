I see... I see... I see... I see... Could you hurry up with this? Another man. You see another... man for... Cynthia. That's what you see? That... that's my future? Your ball must be dirty. It's crystal. Not really, it isn't. Could you... stop doing that?! It's a piece of bazooka bubble gum. It's not a bomb, for Christ's sake. Shit! You're such a scaredy-cat. I'm not... I'm not a scaredy-cat. Yes, you are. You get freaked out about every little thing. Look, I know at times I have some issues. It's gone beyond issues. It's, like, weird choke-in-your-sleep kind of shit. Do you know what it's like? Do you? No. No. Of course not, 'cause you don't remember a goddamn one. Nocturnal panic attacks. It's amazing. They have a name for everything nowadays. I don't want to talk about this right now. I just don't like you popping your gum. Let's go to the cards. Well, the ball seemed to be working pretty well. Yes. She's having an affair. Who? Cynthia. ♪ The best is yet to come ♪ Is this true? Well... Jack, um... Yeah. She's leaving you. It says that? Leaving me for who? A rock... Let me do this. Jack, um... I thought that this would be fun, you know, to come here and get our futures read. Maybe something would change things. I-I never expected this. She's good. You're good. What... what is going on? It's over. I kind of met this rock musician... In my acting class, and... God, he totally bangs my world. And... I-I don't understand. Look. I want to have fun, Jack. I'm too young not to be living. What are you talking about? Just because I don't want to go out and party? You just don't get it, do you? What? Get what? I... I'm here. I'm here. We're going to the movies. The first time in five months. You know, Jack, you weren't like this when we met. You're getting worse, and... I'm done wasting time thinking that you're gonna change. ♪ We've only tasted the wine ♪ I can't believe this. I have to go after her. What now? Death. I'm going to die? It could be death or a life-altering change that could include death. I don't believe this. It has something to do with your next birthday. No, this is... This is really, really screwed up. You know, I think that you just want me to buy all your little candles and crystals so that you can make rent this month. I feel a presence... An older man. Your father, maybe? What do you mean my father? He has a message for you. I'm on my last leg, for Christ's sake. It'd be so much easier if you could just make the trip out here, and we could finish sorting out my affairs once and for all. I would love to, Mr. Hines. Yeah, I'm feeling under the weather. I wouldn't want to get you sick. I'm dying, Jack. How much sicker do I need to be? Yeah, I just wouldn't feel right, you seeing me like this. Why, it's always something with you, Jack! What are you, the elephant man? I'm, I'm just someone you don't need to meet in person. Nonsense! I'd love to meet you. I talk to you more than I do my own kids. And I would love to meet you, too, but I regret I can't come to the Hamptons anytime soon. I'm certain if you're not happy with my work so far, my firm could send you out another estate planner. No! No, no need. You're at the top of your game. I'm confident you will complete it all before I expire. Mr. Hines. Life's little curves. Hell, I have no idea about anything anymore. Just get it done! Yeah, consider it done, Mr. Hines. Now, if there's nothing else at the moment that you have questions about, I must get back to work. Feel better, Jack. Good night, sir. Who is it? It's mommy! Um, ma, did you take all your vitamins this week? You can't keep living like this. Do you hear me, Jack? It's just enough. No, I don't want to hear about it, not now, not when I only have a few more weeks. What if it never ends, Jack? Are you still seeing your shrink, your doctor? Yes. I have an appointment on Friday. And he still thinks that this is rational? I know this is not rational! But, you know, that psychic knew things... that Cynthia was having an affair, that she was leaving me. What was I supposed to think? That there was another psychic nutjob two doors down the street. Did you ever consider a second opinion? I saw a program the other night on obsessive-compulsive disorder. You know, Jack, they have drugs. I don't have that. I have "I'm going to die disorder." So, I don't understand why taking a year out of my life to make sure I don't seems hasty. Well, you hardly touched it. Yeah, it was old. It had air... I'll make a new one. Jack, please hear me. Cynthia was not the girl for you. She was an actress. And even though I thought she was horribly wrong for you... And not a very good actress at that... I'm sure it hurt you terribly when she left. But, darling, resume your life. Be happy. Fine. Do it your way. I just... Thank god your father's not alive to see this. Don't... Don't bring up dad. Why? Because he would tell you this is ridiculous? Mom... And you know what? You'd listen to him. Goddamn it! Hey. Tell me why you're so angry. Because you won't listen! I'm sorry. I don't understand. I just don't understand you anymore. I know this has been hard for you. I do. I don't want to die. So, if being a nutcase for... It's just three more weeks until I get this crazy year over with. If that's too much to ask, then, don't come back with any more stuff. I got you those shiitake mushrooms you wanted... the organic ones from Mr. Chui. Are we gonna talk today? Jack... why don't you take that thing off? I don't expect anything's going to happen here during our session. What do you think? Jack... I want you to slip out of that thing. I promise you, you're going to be totally safe sitting on my sofa. Jack? Jack? What is the probability that something's going to happen? It could happen. But what is the probability? This time, it could happen. But what is the probability? Jack, focus. We are talking about probability. What is the probability? There are people out there dying every day, thinking that there was no probability. How am I gonna be able to help you, Jack? And I do so much want to help you. Don't judge me because none of the assortment of antidepressants you prescribed took on me. I am not judging you. I think you have a very strong will. You are steadfast, committed. These are extraordinary characteristics, honorable. That I'm completely committed to screwing up my life and that I do it so well? I think you're missing my point, Jack. It's not what we do in life. It's not what we accomplish, but it's how we do it. You know, there is more to a book than the ending. The journey... I... I know. I know. Do you, Jack? Well, not exactly. I mean... Look at me. Yeah. Well... we'll just write this off as one little chapter in the Jack whilton epic. You know... The fucked-up years. What floor? Three, please. No! No. Here, here, let me help you. They're a little out of sequence. Yeah, I'm making copies now. I'll messenger them to the firm to have them reviewed. I haven't gotten... too personal, Jack, but... What's wrong with you? Are you ugly or just sick? It's somewhere in between, sir. Well, I don't know you that well, but... Take a piece of advice. Don't... squander your life thinking about... the regrets, 'cause there's not a damn thing you can do about it, anyway! Be happy... That you were given the opportunity to... Be here at all. Experience life's potentials. Have... something to take with you. There's peace in that, Jack... Knowing that you're dying... But that you weren't afraid to live. You hear me? I did, sir. It takes... balls... To live life. You have balls, don't you, Jack? Most of the time. I mean, I definitely had them last year. Well, I'll get you some. Okay. I'm tired. I'll talk to you later. You will, sir. Good night. Who is it? It's the girl from the elevator. Hey. Hello, again. Are you... Are you feeling better? Sort of. Um... you're probably wondering why I'm here. Well, first of all, I want to thank you for that episode in the elevator. I'm a little embarrassed. Don't be. But, um... I received some... Um... some really bad news the other day. And... I understand that you're an estate planner. Yes... I am. I would like to hire you. Okay. For me. I know. I know. You're probably thinking that I'm a little young, and I have my whole life in front of me. So, what's the rush? But the other day... I learned about... Life's little curves? Exactly. So... Can you do it? Sure. Great! I'm Audrey, 306. Jack whilton. ♪ I will tell you my happiness softly ♪ Should I come down to your office, or... I work out of my apartment. That's easy. So do I. Writer? Audrey, why don't you come by... Let's see. Um... How about... How about... You seem a little hesitant. Are you sure that you have the time? No, I, yeah, I d-definitely have the time. Um, just... it's more about me, and... You know what? It's fine. Forget it. It was just a thought. No, wait. Wait! Hold... I can do this. I mean, I-I-I want to do this for you. Really? Really. Okay. So, why don't you come over tomorrow... 5:00? Sharp. I'm very good about punctuality and meeting deadlines. In fact, it's kind of my pet peeve. Well, 5:00 it is, then. Okay. Bring bank statements, stock portfolios just... just to get US started. I'll see you tomorrow. Right. Yep, right. I'm gonna miss you. You're so stupid. You're so stupid. It's Audrey. Leave a message. It's me. It's Melanie. Audrey, are you there? Audrey? What happened to that long message about "don't bother me between the hours of 8:00 and 2:00. I'm creating," or whatever it is you say? Anyway, Paul and I are outside. We're waiting to hear. Are we celebrating? Call me on my cell. Okay. Bye. You are so... punctual. I know. It's a little daunting, but it was part of my job... editorial? I'm kind of a freak about deadlines. Come in. I don't want to mess up your way of doing things. It's pretty difficult to throw me off track. Yeah, I know what you mean. I can be pretty hardheaded when it comes to certain things. Is this your family? Yeah. You have a brother. Two, actually. Sister. I'm the youngest. You? Actually, both my parents passed away when I was in college... part of this. You have your work cut out for you, Jack, to try to figure out who to leave all my stuff to. Okay. So, basically, I've got an idea of what your financial responsibilities are. I know what you have, what you owe, including that phone bill you threw away. Bless you. Bless you... squared. They always come in threes. That's interesting. So, um... I'm gonna need you to make out a will, if you haven't already done it. My god. You know it's almost 8:00? Hey, are you hungry? You want to grab something to eat? There's this new Ethiopian restaurant down in hell's kitchen that I've been wanting to try. You eat everything with your hands. Yeah, but I was gonna have a shake for dinner. Um... okay. Then, I guess I'll get going. You don't have to go. No, no, that's okay. I have my cat, Mr. Hungry guy. Hold... hold... hold on. I'm sorry I can't have dinner with you tonight. It's okay, Jack. We'll go some other time. No, wait! I'll... I'll come. Are you sure? I will meet you downstairs at 8:30... sharp! It's Audrey. Leave a message. Audrey? It's Jack. You won't believe this. I laid down for, like, a minute, and I fell asleep. So sorry. I'll... I'll make it up to you. How about Friday? Again, don't be mad. It's not you. Can't we just talk about this on the way? You never have time. You always have to go. I do have time for you. I just have this appointment I need to get to, Audrey. It takes me two weeks to get a hold of you, and then I have... That is so untrue! You're in meetings all day long. What do you do all day long? No, I'm serious. You know what? You are so dramatic. I'm dramatic? It's always about... Audrey. What a surprise. Hey, Jack. What's going on? Just out running errands, you know? Yeah? Hi. I'm Melanie. Yeah, actually, we are on our way to a movie. We have to go. Sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm acting weird for some reason. I don't know why. It's okay. But I'll see you for dinner tonight, right? Yeah. I'll be there. Great. So, we have to go. I will see you soon. Yeah. So, it was nice meeting you. Good. Good to meet you. Bye, Jack. Who is that guy? Just... Isn't there something you can give me? Nothing has worked so far, Jack. You said so yourself. But I... I like her! I... I've never felt like this. I understand. But do you really want to get close to this girl, considering her circumstances? I mean, from what you told me... As close as I can get. What is it about her that she finally makes you feel like wanting to take chances? You know, this is a little odd, Jack. Please... Just tell me what I should do. Okay. Okay. Temporary fix. Temporary. I'm going to prescribe to you some valium. It's very good. Now, I want you to take one-half of a valium one hour before you meet her... and no alcohol. No alcohol, okay? And I want you to go through all of your routines... everything by the Jack whilton book. Okay? Jack... What is it about her that she makes you feel like you're not going to die? She's... fearless. Not again, Jack. Audrey? Sorry I'm late. My god. This is so good. You don't like it? No, it's great. Great. Jack... We're in a restaurant? In the middle of Harlem. You couldn't have had a craving for deli? No! I have always wanted to try an authentic soul food restaurant. Come on! What... what are you so afraid of? No one is going to hurt you. Wow! You really don't like living dangerously, do you, Jack? Audrey, I know this is hard to believe, but almost a year ago I was nothing like... Well, this. What changed? Me? Will you excuse me a second? This is just... just my luck. I never thought I'd die while digesting soul food. You hardly ate anything. I'm... I'm sorry for... for everything. You know, you, you can go back and reorder. Hey, you... you okay? I need to sit down. Hey! Hey, hey! Come on. Let's go. Jack? What are you doing? I found a cab. No, wait! Yeah, this is great. Now what do we do? That is so... wrong! Jack? Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Yeah, but, um, don't tell them that because, you know, they never get it. Hey! You... destructors of private property! That's wrong! They stopped! Jack, I told you not to say anything. Well, they're... they're just little kids. What could they possibly do to me? You look... more flesh tone this afternoon. What happened to your eye? Once I sobered up and picked myself up off the bathroom floor, I went back and kicked those kids' asses and their big brothers' ass, then their fathers' asses. But, you know, when their mothers showed up, I ran like hell. Are you gonna tell me what happened to your eye? It looks like it hurts. I slipped. That's all. And, it does. You should be more careful, Jack. I've been the dictator of careful up until last night. But I've got it all under control now. Now that you mention it, what was up with you last night? Momentary lapse is all. No, really. Is there something that I should know? I don't drink much. You had a sip of beer. Come on! Yeah, but I also had the bourbon shrimp as my entree. I don't get you, Jack. Tsk. But it looks like you're going to live. Well, that's good news. So, where did we leave... Hey, Jack? Yeah? Do you want to go to the track? The track? Yeah! Yeah! Belmont... horses, betting, real-beef hot dogs and ice-cold beer. I've never been. Actually, I have a lot of work to do. I have another client i'm finishing up some work for. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. You don't have to go. We have all your stuff to do. I don't feel like it today. Audrey? What's wrong? You know, with you? Why the hell would you ask me that? Why the hell would you ask me that?! I'm not sharing, but I have some time, Jack, and it's my time, and there's stuff that I've always wanted to do. So, I'm gonna do it. You get it? I get it. Like, eating at that soul food restaurant. I get it. Or riding on a Harley. Or flying to Paris for the opera. I've never been to Paris. The small, almost superficial stuff, that only matters when the hourglass is running out of sand. I get all that, but... What about love? Love. Love is what me got into this mess in the first place. I've had enough love. But, Audrey... Yeah? Are you scared? No. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm relieved. Wonder what's been going on in the world. Wreckage has been found in the northern Atlantic ocean... Say there are no survivors. Commercial jetliner... Casualties are expected... Jack whilton. Hello, honey. It's mommy. Sorry for the noise. Your sister and I are getting our hair done. And after that, we're gonna go out and pick up some younger men. Don't tell him that! Well, it's the thing. Older women, younger men. They say women live longer. Mom, that is so disgusting. Your sister thinks i'm disgusting. How are you, sweetheart? Actually, you'd be proud of me, mom. I went on a date. My god! He went on a date. Tell me all about it, honey. Hang on, mom. Jack whilton. This is Dr. Anderson. I'm Mr. Hines' physician. Is everything all right? No. No, I'm afraid it's not. He is still conscious. And he wants to know if everything has been taken care of. Yeah, all the papers have been signed. Yeah, all the papers have been signed. I'll have them delivered first thing in the morning. I'll let him know. Could I talk to him, please? I'm sorry, Mr. Whilton. That will not be possible. Then, um, thank you and tell him I will take care of everything. Thank you. Mom, can I call you back? No! Jack, come on. I want to hear all about your date, please? Doesn't matter, anyway. It was a pathetic mess. I screwed it up. It's... it's over. I'll call you tomorrow. Jack, I had a good day... I had a good day at the track. You're never gonna believe what happened to me. So... Unless this is really important, I don't have time to chat about horses and... and real-beef hot dogs and whatever else you found simple. Fine. Jack, I get the message. I'll see you around. Audrey? Jack. This isn't real, is it? That was my father's. That's my brother. Yeah, right. I, I thought I saw a resemblance. What's that? I am gonna get you drunk. Don't worry, Jack. We're not gonna leave my apartment. Not tonight, anyway. And I promise I won't take advantage of you, either. Let me guess. Getting shitfaced on Tequila is on your list. No! But you look like you need several drinks, and I got them. Here's to going to Paris. To Paris. Ooh-whee! You like Paris, right, Jack? Right? I had a good day at the track. I had a really, really good day at the track. Aud... No, i-i-i... No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't... don't decide now. Have... have a few more and then decide. No, I... I... There's my Hemingway! Part of the flying-circus act. He loves hanging on the ledge. Come here, baby. Tsk-tsk-tsk. Come here! He's being antisocial. Why are you getting me drunk? I think that you need it. I'm a Tequila advocate under these precise circumstances. What circumstances are we talking? Well, the crummy day you're having. Me? What about you? I should be getting you drunk. No, no, no. Jack... Jack, I had a wonderful day. I had a great day. How do you do it? Do what? You know, how do you... Stay so well-adjusted, considering what you're about to face? Face? You mean the big "d"? You see? It absolutely terrifies me, and you just say it casually, like, "q." "Q"? Or... "Margarita." Do you prefer that? What, you being nonchalant about the alphabet? No, the margaritas. I make killer margaritas! No, I want to know why you're so cavalier about your condition. And you're not? About your condition? No. Wait. No, Audrey, Audrey, please. Please just... just answer the question. No! No. I want to talk about you. Why? Because it's obvious. How do you mean? You and everything that you do. It's obvious. Obvious about what? How afraid you are of everything. I want to talk about you. Do you think that I was blind that first day that we met? You in that funny football helmet. Actually, it was kind of cute. Don't be embarrassed, Jack! Come on. I've noticed you for a long time. How long? Since I moved in. People talk, you know? I was curious who the hermit was, sneaking around the hall in football gear. You were definitely too young to be... And definitely too small to be in the NFL... no offense. Sorry. Why haven't you said anything? Because it's none of my business. But, um... That first day, when we met, those regrettable eyes through that face mask? You are a nice guy, Jack. Too bad I didn't meet you a day sooner. Look! Look! See? He knows you're a nice guy, too. All the herbal crap i'm taking, I'm probably on catnip, too, and don't know it. So... Are you going? As you have cleverly deduced, I'm a basket case, and now you're asking me to fly... in an airplane across a very, very deep ocean. I wouldn't worry about how deep the ocean is, Jack. You're gonna die from the crash. Yes! That, too. Thank you. Thank you so much for confirming my worst nightmare. My pleasure. And who knows what I'll be like at 35,000 feet. Do you have a fear of flying? No. A fear of dying. Have you ever been anywhere on a plane? Not since last trip to Jackson hole with my dad, and then he died. Though my eyes are fuzzy from the hooch, the picture is getting much clearer now. I, I might not be the guy for you. You're doing something important on your list. Are you sure you don't want to ask someone else? I only have a couple more weeks. Me too. I don't know. Well, maybe you should take your brother or someone... My brother's dead. You know what? I don't want to talk about this. I want to talk about Paris. Have a weakness for me, Jack. See, I don't care about all of your scared-to-death crap that you may flip out at 35,000 feet and kill US all. Yeah, you in particular wouldn't. I don't have time to go invite another one of my friends... have them take the time off of work. You're here! You're flexible. I'm a client. It's just one more adventure with me. We'll wrap up all of our business and experience Paris while we're at it. And the ticket is in your name, and it will cost me 100 bucks to change it, Jack. A hundred bones that I could have left to some poor soul. When are we leaving? Jack, please. Please come on. Please. Miss, I need you to get him on the flight now, or it's leaving without you. Okay, please just give me a couple more minutes. You have exactly one. Jack, please. If we don't leave right now, the plane is gonna leave without US. I told you you should have brought someone else. Just... just go without me. You... no, no, no. This is all in your head. No, not this. I've... I've always had a fear of flying. Let me get this straight. You agreed under false pretenses to come on this trip with me, knowing full well that you could never get on this plane. I wanted to. I really... I really, really wanted to. I need you to board now. Please don't be mad. I'm not mad. Y-You'll have a better time without me! Schmuck! Schmuck, schmuck, schmuck! Mr. Whilton? Mr. Whilton, are you sure this is what you want to do? Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we're ready to leave the gate. Please make sure all your personal... Shh-shh! Stop it! She's here. It's all right. You'll be fine. Mr. Whilton, this is Kimberly. She's been flying for over 15 years, and she'll be personally responsible for you for the duration of this flight. Right this way, Mr. Whilton. Right here, Mr. Whilton. There was a young woman... And after we reach our cruising altitude, I'll be back with some champagne, okay? It's like a giant flying living room with cocktail service, right? Hey... I'm glad you're here. Not for long. I took about five valium. Ooh-ooh! You okay? I think the rush of panic just kicked in the drugs. ♪ You're all I really want ♪ headlong ♪ I'm falling in headlong ♪ And act a little braver ♪ the lies that try to trip you ♪ You made it, Jack. How did I get here? Well, between the flight attendant, the security cart, and serge, the 300-pound cabdriver. He carried me to bed? Like a sack of potatoes. Thank god. Okay, then, I am going to go to my room and grab my things. I'll meet you downstairs at 3:00... Sharp. Yeah, well, things don't seem to change for me much, do they? Not even in Paris. I wasn't criticizing you. Audrey? Hey, Jack? Come here. Wow! It's more beautiful than I imagined. You just wait until you touch it and taste it, smell it. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why'd you really want me to come to Paris? Why? Because... I like you, Jack. You're nice. And we get along. There's no complications, no history... No pressure. Just seems like I'm an unnecessary handful for a woman who's quite self-sufficient. Yeah, well, I'm not as strong as you think I am. Look. I didn't want to do this alone. I needed someone who wouldn't judge me, someone who wouldn't think that I was crazy for being impetuous. And you are remarkably that someone. Yeah. The guy wandering the halls in a football helmet. Hey, come on. Let's go see what Henry Miller was talking about. Oui, monsieur? Yes, I would like to get two tickets for the opera, if I could. What evening? Soon as possible? I will try my best. Thank you. So, um, things like your published writing, will that continue to bring in income? Are we really gonna talk business now? I mean, as we travel on these historic streets? So, how long have you been a writer? My god. Quit talking about my writing! The bane of my existence. Don't say that. Yeah, you think I'm kidding? Just answer the simple question. I want to know some things about you. Okay. Um... I've been writing for a long time. I've written editorial for different magazines, mostly vanity fair. Um, short stories, my expository journal, you know, the usual fare. A novel? Yes. My great American tragedy. Which will now never be read. Do we have to talk about this? Wait, wait, wait. Are you done? Yeah. Yeah, I'm finished, all right. Hey, maybe after I die, I'll become a big hit, like Van gogh did. Don't say that. No, it's true. I mean, he painted. Nobody noticed, not even when he cut off his ear. Then, he dies. Pfft! "The irises"... priceless. Yeah, well, he was a little unbalanced. So, um, how long did it take you to write? My god, all of these questions. You know, you're turning into Larry king. We're having a conversation about you for a change. I think I can ask you these things now, don't you? Okay, I'm gonna answer this last question, and then we're on to more interesting topics. What was the question? Your novel... how long did it take to write? Um... my whole life, basically. Well, five years of actually weaving it onto my computer. Are we done? Wow. It's, it's amazing. You know, that you can write and a novel. It's not that hard. Just go to your local bookstore. Apparently, anybody can do it. So, do you want to tell me what it's about? What? Your novel. Why are you so interested? This is unbelievable, really. Me. It's all about me. Even though I wrote it about other people, it's still all about me. I just changed their names. I called them characters. I put them in a grander landscape. I made their life stories more interesting and their losses wrenching by using specific adjectives. Jesus Christ, it's always about me. I'm... I'm sure it's incredible. Why? Because you wrote it. And you're probably a great writer. Like you're a great estate planner? Um, excusez-moi, monsieur. Vin Rouge, s'il vous plait. Um... I'm confused. Did I say something wrong? No. You seem angry. No, I'm not angry. I just... I want to know why all the questions. I'm just trying to get to know you better. If I've said something to offend you... Okay, okay. What else do you want to know about me, Jack? Nothing. Come on. Fire away, Jack. Give me your hard line. Where is this coming from? Okay. Why don't I help you with this probing, little interview? My parents are dead. My brother went and killed himself because he was too high to realize that he couldn't fly. And my novel that I spent my blood and my guts and my soul on was universally rejected by every publishing house for being too simple and uninteresting. Gosh, I guess I just didn't choose the right adjectives. And... The incredible ending in the insipid life of Audrey gersons? I'm gonna die. Is there anything else you'd like to know about me? No. Good. ♪ Seventeen ♪ missing in life ♪ you didn't ♪ and owing him life ♪ you didn't Audrey? What do I do? What do I do? It's all right. No. No, you don't understand. I do. No, you don't.

I mean, I've been worried sick. Paris. Paris as in France? Um... mom, things have changed. Well, how so, Jack? I'm better. Better, really? Better. Yeah. Wow. How wonderful. Does this have anything to do with... this new girl? Sort of. That's great. That's just great. I tell you what. Let me organize a little birthday celebration for you tomorrow night. I'll invite all the kids. And you feel free to bring your new girl. She won't be able to make it. I'm sorry. How come? I blew it. Not again. Listen. Ma, can you make it earlier tomorrow? I have a client I want to visit out on the island in the afternoon. Well, tomorrow, then. So, how's 11:30? I'll do brunch. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Mom? Yeah? Thank you. I love you, Jack. ♪ And many more yay! Make a wish. Don't blow it, though, like you do with all the girls? Are you ever nice? No. Trust me. Yay! Very nice. Michael! Was that absolutely necessary, Michael? Sorry! I'm asking you nicely. Very funny. Well, he's got until tomorrow, right? Careful, Jack. You never know. Ma's cooking could kill you. Stop it! She was drinking earlier. Don't you pay any attention to them. I'm just glad you're back. How about a piece of cake, please? How about you get in line? It's not your birthday. Hello? Jack, it's Howard, Mr. Hines' personal assistant. He's very weak. I think you should come out right away. Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming. I have to go. What? Come on, darling, please. Love you, baby. See you, Jack. Happy birthday! Load me up here. I don't think so. What's his deal? He's crazy. Mom, piece of cake. Mr. Hines? Mr. Hines? Hello, sir. Shall I take this off for a few minutes? Okay. I'm gonna be right outside if you need anything, okay? You're gonna die on me, too? I'm ready. Thank you... At least for waiting until I said goodbye. Don't be afraid anymore, son. Can I sit here a while? I would like that. What's this about, Jack? Hey, Cynthia. I'm not here to try and get you back or anything. Well, good, because i'm pregnant. And Stevie is so the jealous type. Pregnant? Terrific. Yeah, and it's nothing like that. What, then? A year ago, when you took me to see that psychic, and she said that you were leaving me. Yeah? Jack, you didn't think that was for real, did you? That psychic lady knowing all that shit? Look. I'm not really good with goodbyes. And Stevie always tells me that when I break up with him. But I couldn't just dump you, Jack. You're too nice for that. So, I set it up. God. Man. Jack! I'm sorry. Tsk. I thought you knew. No, no, no, no, no, no. I-I-I thought so. I was... I was just... I was having a conversation about it not too long ago, and it came up is all. Good, 'cause, you know, I thought you thought... No. You really had me going there for a sec. Wow. It's not like you to be clever, Jack. You got me. Yeah, no, I totally came up with it in acting class. You're a better actress than I thought you were. Thanks, Jack. I was just in the neighborhood. It's my birthday. Well, tomorrow. Really? Happy birthday. Yeah. Thanks. It was nice seeing you again. You better get back to Stevie. Yeah. Well, it was nice seeing you, too. Still the same, old Jack. One... one question. Why the whole dying thing? I don't know what you're talking about. Look, Jack. I just wanted to break up with you, not kill you. See ya! Beautiful. Dr. Shaw. My god. Jack? You know, I almost didn't even recognize you. How are you? I know I haven't called. Stop. Sit down. Sit down. It's my birthday. And you're still here. You know, that woman must be pretty good medicine, better than anything I could have prescribed. And believe me. I can prescribe some pretty good stuff. It didn't work out with her. I'm sorry to hear that, but she had her own heavy load to carry. But look at you? New chapter, I guess. What do you think made the change? A lot of things. You know, and then Cindy. It was, it was all untrue. Can you believe it? Yes. And that I bought it. No, no, no, no. She planted the thought, and the mind is a very powerful persuader. But it didn't all happen that one day. You had been carrying that fear for a long time. Since my dad. Well, I think that you were old enough to understand your father's death, but I think somehow you thought that you could have stopped him. Somehow you had the will to keep him from dying. Maybe. Well, you are an estate planner. You plan deaths. And there are no accidents. Jack? I killed my father, Dr. Shaw. He was dying. He asked me to do it while he was sleeping, and I... I...
