[industrial music playing] THE PLAGUES OF BRESLAU Hey, babe. Have you ever been gang-banged? That was a question. Sorry. - [man groans drunkenly] - [door slams] [car lock chirping] [quietly sobs] [car door opens] [car door closes] [car starts] [tires squeal] [continues sobbing] [suspenseful music playing] [inaudible] What are you doing, you dumb cunt? What's up? How about a smile? - Arrest that troll. - What? As a witness. You're coming with me, champ. - Let's go for a drive. - What did I do? She's menstruating, and you called her a cunt. Don't gawk like dumb birds. Stop them from trampling evidence. You think it's that easy? In ten seconds anybody who's still here is getting fingerprinted downtown. In our beautiful country, this takes at least four hours. Ten, nine, eight... Bravo, the woman in grey got the message. Seven, six... - Stand aside. - Five... You stay here. If it's a body, we'll need to ask you some questions. Surround this shithole with tape. Here and here... Up to this alley here. And close the stalls. Close this one. Close this one. You can't enter here. Close the stall but give me a sweet roll first. Didn't you hear? Close the shop. Don't worry, I'll pay. There's no entry. Limo. The leather came from a Limousin bull. Impressive, how can you tell? I was raised on a farm. The thickest fluorocarbon fishing line money can buy. You're not big on fishing? Take a photo and cut it. [camera clicking] Still pretty fresh. You smell that? The guy got royally fucked. Take a step back. [phone clicking] You can barely smell him. Get the doctor to give him the last rites. - Hi! - Hi. Good afternoon. [exhales] He expired around two hours ago. Cause of death? We'll just have to wait and see, Heluś. - Can't you guess? - I'd say he suffocated. It looks to me like those Eastern psychos settling a score. And those bruises? Seems like something crushed him. Fresh cattle hides shrink quickly under sunlight. Boys, stretch this gentleman out. It'll make the autopsy much easier later. Well, that rules out foreigners. DEGENERATE Awesome fucking nickname. This hide came off a purebred Limousin. How can you tell? It's as obvious as the difference between you and a real man. [chuckles] - She's talking about you. - No, you! Purebreds in Poland need papers and ID numbers, they're all registered. Check for any breeders in the vicinity. Get a move on with that fucking camera! Fucking lard-ass. Hello, ladies. What did you find? A dead fucking dog. - Please, I've got loans to pay. - Find a real job. - I need Swiss francs. - So do we. You're lucky I don't shoot you for monitoring police frequencies. - Fuck. - Outta here. [sobbing] [birds cooing] For fuck's sake, stop feeding those damn pigeons! They're shitting all over my car! Shove that bread up your ass! Throwing bread on the streets, really! [crying] [continues crying] Still on the case? At least tell me the race of that dog. Go fuck yourself. [gags] Mr. District Attorney? Go wait at a buffet, I'll call you once I'm finished. No need. I'll just observe... Right, maybe I'll go grab a bite. STOP. DISINFECT YOUR HANDS. [clicks] Made with red-hot iron bent to resemble letters. Somebody branded that poor bastard when he was still alive. - [sizzling] - [man groans] [pathologist] Toxicology will tell us whether a tranquilizer was used or if the victim felt everything. He lay there unable to move. The sun shone brightly. The leather started shrinking rapidly. Massive internal hemorrhaging occurred. His circulatory system failed, and the heart stopped, and that was curtains for him. Do you hear how this sounds? Sounds like you're dealing with a whack-job. A very methodical whack-job. [saw buzzing loudly] Only one place sells Limousin cattle near Wrocław. [kisses] - It's all thanks to you, I'm grateful. - [phone camera clicks] Another fucking spotlight whore. [mooing] - A worker noticed the fence was cut. - And? - We counted the herd. - And? Normally, we check inventory once a month. - Are you missing a bull or not? - Just one. - Any witnesses? - I'm sure the locals stole it for food. It only takes a second. They park the truck, grab the bull, drive away, and that's it. Show him the picture. You know who that is? I know that hide. Did you find the meat? Hell, they ate it. You saw the murderer, didn't you? Send us a list of people that bought cattle off you this year. There's no need. Only one place buys them. [machine grinding] [Jarek] Do you know the victim? That's Bogdan Ciuman, the foreman of the first shift here. - I guess he didn't show up yesterday? - That's why I'm here. - Did you file a missing person report? - No. You think we're fucking psychic? It's happened before, he disappears from time to time. A regular employee of the year. You wouldn't believe. He ran this place like a dictator. He liked to drink, but the management didn't really care. No wonder he skipped work. There's no AC here. There's AC, but it's cheaper not to turn it on. [woman sobbing] Were you and the victim close? Close? It was God's justice what happened to that rotten son of a bitch. He got what he deserved. [sobs] What did he do? He tormented us. How? - He wouldn't let us pee. - The bathrooms were closed? Can you imagine? Adults walking around in diapers! And if he had it in for somebody, he made them drink five liters of water and then kept them from going for 12 hours. Every day, he kicked us and abused us. After a few drinks, he enjoyed locking people in the freezer. I almost died of pneumonia. Has he fired anybody recently? Recently? He terminated someone every month. Everybody was scared of him. - How many employees work here? - A lot, I don't know. That's several dozen suspects. Each hated our victim and knew a lot about butchering. That's not how we find him. You need to dredge through everybody's past. [cell phone chimes] Dear citizens. Yesterday, I made a ghoulish discovery at the market near Niedźwiedzia Street. The murderer mutilated his victim by burning the word "degenerate" into his skin. A leather hide was then sewn shut around the victim. Sorry, allergies. Um... The leather hide shrunk under direct sunlight and crushed the victim. However, the perpetrator made several mistakes. And I assure you, I'll skin this bastard myself soon. [laughing] He'll skin him? That's rich! [loud ticking] [explosion] [loud neighing] [people yelling] [woman] Run! [tires screeching] [whinnying] [woman on radio] No. 39-200 calling Bronson. Bronson here. There’s a horse running through the city centre, head there. - Who? - A horse! The fuck should I care? Did it murder somebody? Hard to say, people are panicking. Where's the horse? Some saw it at Słowacki Park, others near Mieszczański Bridge. [siren blaring] Go to the park, I'll take the bridge. I'm not a vet. Horses are not my fucking job. - Just go. - You sure you can drive? Don't make me fucking repeat myself. [sirens blaring] [neighing] [people screaming] [yelling] [man] Ah! [motorcycle revs] Get out of here! [gun cocks] Right, fuck that. We're downtown near the Mieszczański Bridge... - Wait, it's off. - Fuck. Go. We're near Mieszczański Bridge. A dramatic operation is underway to capture a crazed horse that paralyzed the traffic here. [sirens wailing] [people screaming] No. 39-200, it's a racehorse. The loud noises only excite it more. Tell everyone to turn their sirens off. As you can see, a police officer is at the scene. She's directly in the horse's path. [sirens stop] [horse nickers] [shushing] Good horse. Shh. Shh. Easy now, it's over. [crowd clapping] Keep taping, maybe it'll kick her. Shh. Easy, it's okay... Take him. [Jarek on radio] Bronson to Helena. I'm here. I've located the horse. [sighs] Nice, considering I’m right next to it. I can't see you. - I'm standing right fucking next to it. - How? It's running! [woman screaming] PLUNDERER Inspector, we're live! Can you tell us how you felt... Get the fuck out of here! [woman on radio] No. 39-200, a horse just trampled four officers. Medical assistance needed in Słowacki Park. Block the street, secure the body and get them out of here. What body? [car tires squealing] - [man] I can't look. - [woman] Record everything. And you call yourself a fucking man? Get out of here right now! Put away that cell phone! [sirens wailing loudly] Turn off those sirens, 39-200! [horse neighing] [loud thud] - [horse neighs] - [crunching] [gunshot] This dramatic day will go down in Wrocław history... The dramatic events unfolded on this very bridge... Ready! Minutes ago, we witnessed a chilling situation. A crazed horse appeared on the street and almost trampled a police officer. Mieszczański Bridge will be closed until the police secure any evidence found at the scene. [groaning, sniffling] I'm very sorry! I came here straight from my godson's confirmation. Uh, something happen? You should ask her. [sniffles] Miss Halinka, allow me to tell you something. You don't understand the power of PR. Miss Halinka... you've got your priorities and I've got mine. Do I make myself clear? You don't even know my fucking name. Halinka... - Mr. District Attorney! - I'll be right there. Did he wake up? POSTAL SERVICE - It's for the chief. - Thanks. CHIEF POLICE COMMISSIONER, WARSAW [knocks lightly] [Lewandowski] We've screwed up. The chief got a call from headquarters. They're sending over a lady from Warsaw CBŚ. - They're taking over the case? - No, you're still the lead. The woman's a profiler, "an expert on violent crime," they said. The bitch probably can't even tie her shoes. Another case solved by the Central Bureau. I'm moved to tears. She'll be at central station in 20 minutes. Good morning, Helena. Iwona Bogacka. How did you recognize me? - And I guess you're hungry? - I want to see the crime scene. They're taking you off the case. - Who? - Homeland Security. They're saying ANFO explosives were used in the attack. That makes it an act of terror. For fuck's sake, you're trampling evidence! - You can go now. - Excuse me? Polish law doesn't forbid the possession of replica firearms. So everyone can legally buy black gunpowder at 140 zloty per kilogram. The perp loaded two bags with gunpowder and carefully sealed them. Then he hung them from the ceiling about 20 inches from the glass pane. Each gunpowder bag had a simple detonation device attached to it. A cell phone. In front of each window he placed two racing horses, their heads turned towards the street. Two ropes led from their harnesses to the middle of the room. The perp used the ropes to bind the victim's legs and arms. To finish things up, he called both cells at the same time, which made the horses run. [horse whinnying] [cell phones ringing] [explosions] [screaming] [whinnying] This incident only involves the use of black gunpowder. So, according to Polish law, it doesn't classify as an act of terror. You can go now. One hell of a theory. And how do you know it was gunpowder that was used? In two hours, hand him the forensic report on dust particles from the horses' back? Sure. - Guys... - You'll find gunpowder there. Let's get out of here. Smile, you're on candid camera. - They're the ones that taped you? - It's not worth it. - Care to comment? - Give me the disk. - What? - You deaf or dumb? You crazy? [coughing] Take long, regular breaths. You're putting our lives at risk and obstructing justice. Next time, I'll take your camera. Fucker, you've let her take the disk? Holy fuck. Plunderer. A thief. String puller. And now, he's the one pulled apart by horses. Almost comical, isn't it? Lady... An innocent man died. I ask you to respect that fact. - Are you certain? - Of what? Helena... when exactly was the victim torn apart by horses? Just after 6:00 p.m. And when did we find the first victim sewn inside that bull's hide? Around 6:00 p.m. [laughs] And what's so particular about that? Absolutely nothing, sir. Exactly. There's also nothing particular about the motive, right? Nothing resembling this comes to mind? Have you ever studied the history of your own city? Or not particularly? Well... Ever hear of the Week of Plagues? When Frederick the Great conquered Lower Silesia in the year 1741, he wanted Breslau to become a European metropolis. But he knew it was impossible unless the city was cleansed of its worst plagues. Degeneracy, pillaging, bribery, slander, oppression and deviousness. He created the Week of Plagues. Every day at 6:00 p.m., Breslau's executioner publicly tortured and killed a person found guilty of one of those crimes. And so... the degenerates died on Monday, pillagers on Tuesday, and so on. You mean to tell me that five more people will die this week? Four. Sunday's are a holiday. Excuse me. In an hour his "new theory" will be on the news. If this is punishment, the guy on the slab was a thief. There's not much of his face left to identify. He may have a record. Check his DNA and fingerprints. [pathologist] I may have some luck with this, but no promises. What about the horses? They were stolen yesterday from a local racing horse stable. They were covered in black powder. - Should we visit the stables? - I need to eat. Want to tag along? No, I have some crackers here. But Heluś looks hungry. I'll drop you off on my way to the hospital. You'll be visiting your partner? I'd like to meet him. He won't do much talking, he's in a coma. I know. Hey, what are you doing here? - I'm a guest star, I'll call you. - Okay. - What are his chances? - None, craniocerebral trauma and a massive, inoperable hematoma. His brain turned to mush. - But... - There is no "but". His brain won't regenerate, its damaged parts are shutting down. These are the parts responsible for all vital life functions. He won't make it. Be sure to explain this to his wife. She won't listen to me. It happened ten miles from Warsaw. It was August. A beautiful, sunny day. I was with my mom on our way back home from vacation. We'd rolled down all the windows. I felt a sting. I got out of the car, drank some water before I felt a bit woozy. My ears started ringing. I urinated and defecated. Then lost my breath. That's when the spasms started. The ambulance arrived 12 minutes later. It took me to the hospital. They resuscitated me, but the doctors said I was a goner. I was in a coma for ten days. All because of a small hornet's sting. One was enough. I heard the cries of my mother. It felt like I was too drunk to move. The worst part was not knowing where I was. I had a splitting headache. The ceiling lamps terrified me. I was so hot, but they kept on covering me up. I could feel my mother stroking my hands. Every time she left, I cried inside. She played "We are the Champions" on a loop, begging me to wake up. I was so angry at her. I wanted to get up and tell her how I despise that song. For your sleeper, time stands still. Hour after hour, he's struggling to let you know he hears your voice. If you give up, he'll be all alone. Your touch will give him strength. Remember, first, above all else, the doctors are giving him no chance. Secondly, there is still hope. Whether your man lives or dies depends solely on you. I'm living proof of that. [cell phone chimes] [Helena] Sorry. WE'VE GOT AN ID ON THE "PLUNDERER" [indistinct announcing on PA] We know the victim had ties with horse racing bookies. You owed him money. I won't miss him. It seems luck is on your side, right? Listen closely. He was a thug, you understand? He had nothing to do with the races. He gave out quick loans with insane interest rates that were impossible to pay off. He destroyed lives. The ones that refused to pay got their teeth ground down with a file or... Oh, yeah? And nobody called it in? - I called it in. - Stop fucking lying. You said Pochylski sent your genitals in a jar to your wife. I didn't know it was the truth. But you dropped the charges. What would you have done? You don't help anybody. Helena. A beautiful name. Want to switch? I went through hell with it in elementary school. Aren't you the lady that stopped the horse? May I take a picture? Fifty zloty. Get out of here. You should've let him. - Why? - Don't you want to be a hero? One Batman is enough. The situation is under control... How did you stop that horse? I was supposed to be a farm vet. What happened? I prefer to help people. You're quite an actress. Better than Meryl Streep. What's your fucking point? Homicide detectives don't help people. The dead are beyond saving. Nobody bothered to help that guy on the racing track. That's why the murderer stepped in. So you know everything because you came here from the capital? We can talk about something different. We were to be wed May 21st. My fiancee left to buy a bottle of wine. The driver who killed him was drunk. How long did he get? He had political immunity. All testimonies were withdrawn, and his blood test results somehow got lost. Then you understand our murderer's motives well. [exhales] - It's not about punishing people. - So what's he after? Why risk murdering people in public? He wants each crime to be spectacular. It's about publicity. He's showing he's smarter than us. So far, he's right. I'll see you at 6:00 p.m. One question is on everybody's mind. Will the Breslau Executioner, as we came to call him, kill another person before 6:00 p.m.? Mr. District Attorney, would you like to add something? [sniffing] Well... I would advise... vigilance. [coughs] Excuse me. Sorry. [applause] [orchestra playing] [operatic singing in Russian] [operatic singing in Russian] DEGENERATE - MONDAY [camera clicks] SLANDERER - THURSDAY KEEP QUIET IN THE READING ROOM [operatic singing in Russian] [operatic singing in Russian] [operatic singing in Russian] [bell tolling] [orchestral music continues] [operatic singing in Russian] [singing continues] [faint muffled yell] Fire! Fire! [panicked screaming] [faint muffled yell] [all screaming] Where's the extinguisher? Help! Calling all vehicles, 39-267. A woman was set ablaze in the opera house on Świdnicka Street. We need to immediately evacuate... [people screaming] [sirens wailing] Iwona, somebody's on fire at the opera house! Get to Świdnicka Street! - Anybody seen the perp? - He ran backstage! [Iwona] Police, freeze! I came as soon as I heard. [loud banging] [man] Is anybody there? Help! Help me! [banging continues] - Show me your hands! - [Iwona] Who are you? - A mechanic! - [Helena] What mechanic? I work the trap door under the stage! I saw a guy wearing a mask. I thought he was an actor, but he hit me in the head. That's all I remember. Get out, we'll need a description of the attacker. - This man saw the perp. - Right. Good work putting out the fire quickly. It wasn't us. - Then who? - It was the perpetrator. He came back? The fire went out by itself. He made sure only the woman burned. Do you see this? Class five universal sorbent. We use it to deal with flammable spills or larger fires. Is it hard to come by? No. Only the victim was doused in gasoline. The scene and that prop here were covered with fireproof granulate. The resulting fire had nowhere to go, so it only enveloped the victim and stopped. Did you try to save her? He stole the extinguisher. We came back not a minute later, but the fire had already burned out. She was already dead? In case of a fire, people rarely die of burns. More often than not it's the screaming. If you catch fire, there's still a chance you'll live as long as you don't breathe. But if you try to scream and take a deep breath, you inhale the gasoline fumes, and your throat and lungs catch fire. She died because she opened her mouth to scream. What about before somebody set her ablaze? - No screams? - I didn't hear anything. Maybe your singing drowned her out? She couldn't scream. Her vocal cords were cut. We've managed to obtain the recording. Do I still have to take that guy downtown for a description? - What recording? - Here you go. [audience screaming] The police are desperately searching for this man. Their worst fears have become reality. Here, in the Wrocław Opera, the Executioner has committed his third murder. The police are asking for help with identifying the victim. We still don't know the name of the woman in the picture. If you recognize her, please contact the police immediately. [fly buzzing] We've gotten so many calls the line is down. People identified Bogumiła Zych. "The Unsinkable Bogusia. Director of Wrocław Treasury, Bogumiła Z. has been cleared of all bribery charges. She was suspected of accepting compensation for turning a blind eye to the illegal activity of eleven companies. There wasn't enough evidence to prosecute her." [man] Hold this down. CORRUPT - Good morning. - Hello. He moved his leg. He'll be up and about in no time, cursing you. Don't wait, organize rehab as soon as possible. [woman] Why would he curse at me? When I woke up, I spat and screamed at the doctors in German. I barely knew the language. How is that possible? The brain can't regenerate, but the parts that function can compensate for the damage. Information, such as a foreign language heard in a movie, is stored in our heads. A sleeper expels it uncontrollably. He moved his toe. Go. Go to him. Speak as you would normally. You're the only person that can bring him back. Jarek. My beloved. Darling, we're here. Me and Maciuś. - We know that you're in there. - Thank you. [woman] We'll wait for you, my darling. We'll wait for as long as necessary. Please. Wake up. Remember that we love you. We need you here, with us. As a student, I used to come here to concentrate. - Did it help? - It still does. What can you tell me about the victims? Not much. Exactly. Three victims from different backgrounds, different social and financial standings. Once we understand his choice of victims, we'll catch him. And if he chooses them randomly on the web? He could've easily read about the unsinkable Boguśka. But not about his first two victims. The answer is somewhere in their pasts. We need to check every enemy they had. A pattern may emerge. Catch. Oh! [chuckles] There! Do you get the impression he's controlling our every move? Why show himself in the opera? Maybe he wanted to introduce himself. So he wants to get caught. [Iwona] Stop here, I'll go grab some groceries. - Do you want something? - [Helena] No, thanks. Thanks. [cell phone ringing] - Yes? - [Lewandowski] Are you alone? In this fucking room or in life generally? Yes or no will suffice. - Yes. - Exit the room. - Where should I go? - To the chief's office. Don't speak to anybody. What is this, fucking charades? Tell me what this is about. The perp is here. - [Felu] Where are you heading? - To the archive. I thought you may be hungry. - Want me to get something for you? - No, Felu, thanks. Helena. Are you okay? They're expecting you. Is it Felu? We got a call from HQ 15 minutes ago. Warsaw never sent anybody over. Iwona Bogacka doesn't exist. How did that woman walk into our station? She falsified an order from the CBŚ and nobody questioned its validity. Police, freeze! I came as soon as I heard. [loud banging] [man] Is anybody there? Help! Help me! - But why? - To find out what we know. She took a big risk. She was looking for something. [cell phone ringing] - It's her. - Track her location. Too late. Where are you? Step away from the window and lie on the ground. Get down! [alarm beeping] SLANDERER Block all the exits! - You seen a woman leaving? - [man] Yes, a second ago. [panting] [man] The same van appeared at exactly 4:01 p.m. There's a man inside. So she moved freely around a station full of police officers without arousing any suspicion? These containers are usually full of dirty laundry from the jail. Police officers see them twice a week. How do criminals know these things? From the web. Okay then. Print out her picture and start combing through city. That won't work. - How many cameras do we have? - Seventeen. And you're saying not even one has captured her face? She's wearing a cap the whole time. She had time to learn how to hide. She may be smart and know how to avoid cameras, but she fucked herself by coming here. - I don't think so. - What do you mean? When did we realize that headquarters didn't send a profiler? After an anonymous phone call. It wasn't our discovery. Once she was ready, she revealed herself. She's following a plan. - They'll fire us for this, right? - Yes. But before that happens, we'll get her. Check the surveillance tapes from all the places you visited. One of the cameras had to have captured her. MUNICIPAL SURVEILLANCE OFFICE - She wasn't on the train from Warsaw. - That's all we know? She didn't even check in at the hotel. Give her description to a criminal sketch artist. The thing is, that bitch from TV saw me with her. If we show her face to the public, it'll seem like the police were harboring a murderer. Well, well, well. How could you let this happen? I wasn't the one yapping on the news. Only dogs yap. Do we know who the victim was? Want me to release a photo of a torture victim inside the police station? Let's focus on finishing her portrait first. Elongate the face. Print that. [cell phone ringing] - [Iwona] Good morning, Helena. - Who are you? You look very tired. How would you know? I'm right behind you. [gasping] [dialing] Don't show the portrait, I know how to find her. Hey, what are you doing here? - I'm a guest star, I'll call you. - Okay. Leave us alone. Good evening. Do you know this woman? - [man] Magda Drewniak. - Who is she? My former deputy supervisor at CBŚ. In Wrocław? In the old days. They fired her in 2003, during decommunisation. She chose the police station for a reason. You'll help me identify the victim. Call me once you have her address. SLANDERER That's Darek Szcześniak, my former chief from CBŚ. - And Magda Drewniak's superior? - Yes. - Why would Drewniak kill him? - It's his testimony that got her sacked. What did she do to him? First, his arms and legs were broken with a heavy hammer, possibly one used for laying down tracks. She brought him into the station alive. [grunting] He died from a single blow to the larynx that severed his spinal cord. [cell phone chimes] WE'VE GOT HER ADDRESS - [officer 1] Step away from the door! - [officer 2] Hit it! [yelling] [screams, panicked squeals] Police! Let's go. Who are you? Alicja Drewniak. - Magda Drewniak is your daughter? - Yes, what happened? Leave us. Relax, don't be afraid. - Don't fret. - Don't be afraid. - Relax. - Where's your daughter? - She's working. - Where? In Warsaw. [girl moans] Going on a trip? - [girl cries] - We need to move out by Monday. THE HISTORY OF WROCŁAW Your daughter appreciates local history? - [girl yelling] - Shh. She loves this city. History was her second field of studies. - What was the first? - Law. - Easy now. - Are they sick? Magda and her husband had conflicting genes. Lenka and Bartuś were both born with spinal myositis. Her husband left her with nothing, flew away to Ireland. And the kids' treatment amounts to over 40,000 zloty a year. Yeah. And the drug that stops the symptoms of myositis... Can you guess how much it costs? Five hundred and forty thousand... euros! Euros! Per child. - With no reimbursement. - Why are you moving out? We're not moving out, we're being evicted. - Why? - Because of our debts. Please, tell me, has Magda done something? I'll need some answers first. Look at this photo, don't show it to the kids. Was Magda thrown off the force because of this man? [exhales] Magda worked for the militia in 1989. She was mainly stuck behind a desk doing paperwork. In time, she was supposed to replace Szcześniak, but before that happened, he smeared her name. According to his testimony, she played a role in a fatal beating of a politically-involved student. They fired her. Took away all her rights a year before her pension. Director of Treasury? After losing her job as a policewoman, Magda began working for the Wrocław Department of Treasury. She discovered her boss was intentionally destroying evidence, holding several criminal cases back so they pass the statute of limitations. She decided to come forward and make the Ministry of Finance aware of her crimes. They organized some kind of an investigative committee... which blamed Magda for whistle-blowing! She was interrogated behind a glass window for all her colleagues to see her. They made a show of kicking her out! She described the situation to Jagielski but never received a response. - Jagielski, the Prime Minister? - That's right. [gasping] My God. [sobbing] He's an acquaintance of Magda's. From technical school. After Magda lost her job in the Department of Treasury, we fell deeper and deeper into debt. We took out loans. This is the man that convinced us to bet our money! He said he had a sure thing! He even made all the arrangements for us. The moment his horse lost, he started charging us interest! The meat packaging plant manager? Magda couldn't find a job. They offered her a position preparing meat. Every day she worked for 14 hours. She stopped speaking to me. Her health began to fade. These children need money for treatments. 5:48 p.m. Who's the landlord? Targosz. Roman Targosz. The Oppressor. [sirens wailing] Ask the secretary where he is. The debt collector's jogging near the promenade. OPPRESSOR [struggling] [sirens wailing] [people screaming, yelling] Ah! [grunting] [groaning] Police, stand back! [siren wailing] She went that way. No. 39-200, the perp is hiding inside an abandoned building near city port. Inform the counter-terrorism unit. Spread out. We were worried sick, sweetheart. I think she sedated me. It's been two hours. What did that bitch do to you? Whatever it was, something stopped her. She dumped me like garbage. [cell phone chimes] What is it? CROOK Let's not panic because someone sent a picture. - We get a lot of those. - Not someone, the killer. The same one that has killed five people since Monday. At 5:30 p.m. tomorrow, the PM will attend a motorcycle race at the Olympic Stadium. You should at least consider canceling this trip. - No chance, he loves motorcycles. - And comes from Wrocław. According to one definition, a terrorist is someone who did everything in their power to negotiate. Our woman contacted the PM 23 times, pleading for help. Left without an answer, she decided to kill five people. Maybe you should try prosecuting the PM? Who are you? Voicing such opinions can only do harm. We're soon up for reelection. The Prime Minister can't have anything to do with this case. [man] There's no real risk. Our analysts say the probability of an attempt on his life is around 3.8%. I don't how they came up with that number, but that woman is always a step ahead. Be ready for anything, even a UFO landing on the stadium tomorrow. I know why she held me for two hours. She made a recording. It's on my cell. What? Not so long ago, not more than 300 years in the past, the royal subjects could trust their ruler to keep the order and hand out justice to any evildoer that deserved it. Just like you, I'm from Wrocław... Prime Minister. You've made promises during your campaign. You were supposed to help people like me. In your manifesto, you swore... to uphold law and order. The citizens were supposed to be able to depend on you each time the law is broken. But you're nothing but a crook... that likes having his boots licked. It was your incapability that made me seek out justice for myself. What the fuck are you doing? That's crucial evidence. As of now, Homeland Security is in charge of this investigation. The race will be attended by the PM, a great admirer of motorcycle sports and Wrocław native. [distant cheering] [cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Prime Minister Edward Jagielski, who has come here for the race. [engines roaring] [inaudible] Ladies and gentlemen, today the Prime Minister celebrates his 46th birthday. ♪ A hundred years may he live ♪ ♪ A hundred years may he live ♪ Son of a bitch. ♪ Once more may he live a hundred years ♪ Long may he live On this occasion, the WTS Sparta motorcycle team prepared a very special gift. A beautiful golden helmet. What the fuck is this? [man] What's going on? We need to evacuate him this instant! I've just been informed the PM had to leave the stadium. We don't know the reason yet. A pen drive for the Prime Minister. Pretty fucked in the head, huh? Sorry, but it's me again... Prime Minister. She sells sea shells on the... Fuck. Okay, fuck it. Let's roll. Homeland Security made a gruesome discovery. The golden helmet, intended as a gift for the PM, contained the severed head of Magdalena D., wanted in connection with the five murders that were committed in Wrocław last week. According to unofficial sources, a pen drive was found with the head that contained a message from the murderer to Edward Jagielski. Although Homeland Security denies this is the case, we've received a copy of said pen drive. We've decided to broadcast the footage found on it as it sheds a new light on the case. Now then, Prime Minister... please visit my family's home and explain to my children why they lost their mother. Tell them... that I was wrong in pursuing justice on my own because you've done nothing wrong. Look deep into their eyes and swear it was all my fault. Blame me for being slandered and ousted. Blame me for not having the money to pay for my children's medication. Blame me for getting evicted. The full 21 minutes of the footage will be broadcast just after the news. In it, the killer professes the motives behind her actions, stating that she was forced to murder five people because of Prime Minister Edward Jagielski. These were not victims, she claims, but wrongdoers that fully deserved their fate. According to the first comments on the Internet, Magda D. is a victim of circumstance for which Jagielski is partially to blame. Who exactly killed Magda D. and placed her head in the helmet, a birthday gift for the PM, still remains a mystery. Spread out! I'm sorry. I'm sorry about what happened to your partner, Bronson. I would do anything to change it. Stop spouting out nonsense, you've killed five people. Who did I kill? A sadist that tormented me, locked me in a freezer for hours? A race track loan-shark who tried to sell my children to pedophiles? A corrupt treasury official that left my family penniless and hungry? What about the policeman? He ruined my life for his career. The debt collector that laughed as he left my children homeless. You left your children without a mother. You'll never see them as a free woman again. I'm not going to prison. You really think we won't catch you? If you caught me, I'd do the time. But you won't. Do you know who a terrorist really is? Someone who did everything in their power to negotiate. I've tried everything. You'll free yourself easily. I've used a double-looped figure eight. The people and Jagielski need to know why I've killed. The pen drive contains my whole story. I've taken out a huge life-insurance policy. The insurance company will refuse payment if I commit suicide. This money can buy medicine for my sick children and provide them with a house. You'll help me get it. - Why the fuck would I? - You owe me that. For what? Thanks to me, you understood you can do it. Do fucking what? Get even with your fiancée's killer! I know your plan. I've been tailing you for a year. I saw. - [man groans drunkenly] - [door slams] That's why I've chosen you. Check the cell, you'll know what to do with my head. [grunting] Thanks. [gasping] [panting] [cell phone ringing] [woman] Helena? Come over, Bronson has just woken up! Hello? [speaking other language] Easy... [speaking other language] Calm down, Mr. Jarek. There you are. [man] Everything will be fine, Jarek. [Jarek panting] [cell phone chimes] What's wrong? I know why she held me for two hours. She made a recording. It's on my cell. [Iwona] Not so long ago, not more than 300 years in the past, the royal subjects could trust their ruler to keep the order. What the fuck are you doing? That's crucial evidence. As of now, Homeland Security is in charge of this investigation. Tickets, please. Show me the bag. Routine check. Go ahead. - What are you doing here? - I just love motorcycles. I could show you a couple of stunts. We'll be right there. [distant cheering] - Message for you. - Thanks. Sorry, but it's me again... Prime Minister. Yes! The golden helmet, intended as a gift for the PM, contained the severed head of Magdalena D., wanted in connection with the five murders that were committed in Wrocław last week. According to unofficial sources, a pen drive was found with the head that contained a message from the murderer to Edward Jagielski. For fuck's sake. We've decided to broadcast the footage as it sheds a new light on the case. Now then, Prime Minister... Are you that policewoman who stopped the horse? - Yeah. - May I take a picture with you? Sure thing. ACQUITTED: MP MARIAN KULA FOUND NOT GUILTY OF KILLING A 22-YEAR-OLD [man screams, grunts] [glass shatters] [industrial music playing]
