[music playing] [crash] [music playing] [crickets] [wolf howl] [digging sounds] [wolf howl] [slash] [wolf howl] [helicopter] [music playing] [water spraying] The personal diary of an obscure Chinese scientist who lived in the 10th century during the Tang Dynasty. Let me read you an excerpt. "I ran a test on my new discovery today. It is more powerful than I ever dreamed it to be. I can't envision that a man with such power could rule the world, for if misused, it is capable of destroying all of China, perhaps the entire world. Therefore, no one must ever learn of my discovery." What I have just read you was the last entry into this diary. According to my research, he committed suicide shortly thereafter. He never really his discovery to anyone. And I was convinced that the secret was buried with him. So convinced, in fact, that I spent five years in locating his grave site. I sent an excavating party into Red China to dig up that grave. By now, all but one person of that expedition has been eliminated. He organized and led the expedition and arrived back in Hong Kong today in possession of a leather pouch, which he believes contains the secret of that discovery. Once he has that pouch on its way, I want him eliminated. You could have skipped the history lesson, Mr. King. A name was all you had to give me. Ivan Soroka. [music playing] ARLENE: Now, let's see, five days, six hours, and exactly 15 seconds. CALVIN: How dumb can we be? ARLENE: Don't tell me you want out already. I'm hungry. CALVIN: So am I. [music playing] [traffic sounds] Castor Street, bargain hunters paradise where almost any kind of merchandise can be found and had for at the right price. I didn't hear that. But honey, we just can't visit Hong Kong and not buy anything. I promise to make it up to you. You won't be sorry. Martha, that's Calvin Jefferson. Cal, don't look now, but you've been spotted. By god, I was right. Hey, Martha, it is him. Calvin Jefferson. I knew it was you. Why, I saw you fight Jack Foster at the Garden. Man, what a fight that was. Hey, what a punch you got. Yes, sir. You mark my words. You're going to be the next world's champ. Hey, maybe I can get your autograph. I got a book here, no pen. You got a pen? [piano playing] Hey, uh, you must be the new bride. Boy, you're a mighty lucky girl being married to the future world champ. Hey, that's just great. Uh, I'm Marvin. You can call me Marv, huh? That's my wife Martha. Hey, Martha, come over here a minute. I want you to meet the next world's champ. Hey, he's kind of cute. Don't you think so? Huh? Well, it doesn't do much for me if that's what you mean. That's not what I mean. How much? For you, special price, very cheap, only $50. $50? Shi-- are you kidding? I'll take it. Thank you. Hey, hold on a minute. I'm not paying $50 for that piece of junk. How much you pay? How much? $20. Not a cent more. Sold. Thanks, honey. It's the only way I know to get you out of here and back to the hotel. Oh, what about the Aberdeen tour? Thank you. You don't really expect me to lug that thing all over Hong Kong, do you? Uh-huh, I get it. But I'm not licked yet. There has got to be a way to solve this problem. Excuse, please, but problem is no problem. I deliver problem for you to your hotel, for a little fee, of course. Of course. How much? And for you, very cheap, special price, only $2. Huh? Shangri-La Hotel. Room 831. Thank you. [speaking chinese]. Shangri-La Hotel, room 831. [crowd sounds] [music playing] [laughing] [speaking chinese] [screaming] [yelling] [punch] [fighting sounds] [knife slashing] [fighting sounds] [crack] Ah! [splash] [music playing] [crowd yelling] Cal, in the water, look. [splashing] [splash] [crowd yelling] I can't read Chinese. You speak English? Anybody here speak English? Oh, yeah, sure, um, glad to be of help. Yeah, you're welcome. Well, that's that. What do we do now? Back to the hotel to get you out of those wet clothes. Now, see, if I'd known it was that easy, I'd have jumped in that water a long time ago. Come on. What are you waiting on? [boat horn] Look, um, I know you're grateful. But believe me, it's OK. Enough is enough. Maybe he wants something. Driver. Ask him what he wants. Says here his name is Chao Li. He's going to talk. He has no voice. Chao Li, huh? Well, could you ask, uh, Charley here what is it he wants from me? [speaking chinese]. Please tell him that we're sorry. But he can't come with us. We're in a hurry. And we got a boat to catch. [speaking chinese]. Let's go. [music playing] Yes, sir. Key, please. The box arrived for you, sir. Uh-uh. Um, how did he get here? I don't know. But he's here. N-- now, wait a minute, Charley, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You tell him. I don't know what to tell him. Problem, Mr. Jefferson? Yeah. Maybe you can help. He keeps following me. And I don't know what he wants. Perhaps I can speak for you. [speaking chinese] He's a mute. He can't answer you. Perhaps he can write. [speaking chinese] He says, his life belongs to you. Huh? What the hell is that supposed to mean? He says, you saved his life. Yeah, well, he was drowning. And I pulled him out of the drink. That's all. But of course. It is an old Chinese adage. If one saves a life, then he owns the life he saves. Looks like you got yourself a slave. That's not funny. Look, could you explain to him that I'm grateful. But I don't want to own his life. Tell him that I'm going to give it back to him. [speaking chinese]. Tell him I can't own him. I'm leaving Hong Kong tonight for Manila. [speaking chinese]. Thanks, and now if you prepare my bill and arrange for transportation to the ocean terminal because our boat sails at midnight. Yes, sir. And, uh, one more thing. We don't want to be disturbed for the next two hours. Yes, sir. I'll inform the operator. Well, what are you waiting on? [crane sound] [boat horn] [boat horn] [boat horn] [phone ringing] Hello? Uh-huh. Uh, just a minute. Oh, Leo, Leo, long distance. Who is it? Hong Kong. Hello? Mr. King, the merchandise is on the way. Good. SOROKA [OH PHONE]: There's something else I want to tell you about. Yes? What's that? An acquaintance is visiting Manila, Calvin Jefferson, the black American prize fighter. He and his wife will be arriving by boat, the SS Oriental Queen on the 23rd. He'll be bringing with him a gift from me to you. It's that carved wooden Buddha you were asking about. Excellent. Thank you, my friend. I guess you might say that our transaction is complete. Yes, Mr. King. But there is one other thing. But of course, your final payment. I made some other arrangements. But don't worry. I'll see to it that you will get everything that's coming to you. What other arrangements? [door knock] Why your funeral arrangements, Mr. Soroka. You're dead. Goddammit King, you can't do this to me. You rotten bastard, you think of everything, don't you? [door knock] You better answer the door. You bet your ass I'll answer it. [gunshots] [crash] [crash] [punch] [crash] Mr. King, I'm all finished here. [music playing] [crack] [boat horn] Anything to declare? No, nothing that I know of. What's this? That's, um, honey what would you call this? Well, I guess you might say that's a genuine, fake, antique, hand-carved, wooden Buddha. Mind if I see it? No, go right ahead. Thank you. Morning. Mr. Jefferson? Yes. I'm Tony, your man's driver. He couldn't make it. So he sent me to bring you home. Lead on. How do you like Manila? Hot. Other than that, it's OK. Oh, no, it can't be. It is. But how? I don't know. No, it's all right. We know him. Man, this is weird. I mean, this is really weird. And what are we supposed to do? Honey, I don't know. You are the one who saved his life, not me. Look, I'm just asking for a little help. That's all. -Are you ready, Mr. Jefferson? No, just a minute. Charley, you can't come with us. I'm sorry. But that's just the way it's going to have to be. You think he understands. I hope so. So long, Charley. Get in the car. [running sound] [music playing] The key to the trunk. Give it to him. [crash] [punches] [fighting sounds] [scream] [punches] Honey, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You see my man Charley here? Yeah, you know something? I think we're stuck with him. Come on, Charley. No, they didn't get the license number. But it was one of those old style MacArthur jeeps. Yes, they'll be staying here as my guests. Ah, feel free to call anytime you need any more information. Fine. Thanks again, later. He seems to think that it was just an armed robbery attempt. But based on your information, we believe there's a good chance of finding them. Well, let's forget about that for now. How long is your expedition tour going to last? I was thinking of canceling it altogether. After all, I haven't seen you in two years. How long do you intend to stay? We've got a week here, then Hawaii. Good, I'll be out of town for three days. Then we'll have four days to catch up. After all, you're supposed to be on your honeymoon. I'm sure Marlene will understand listening to all our boxing talk. Nothing bores a dame more than a fight game. That's right. I can take a hint. Besides, I have a plane to catch. Don't mind her. She's just the help around here. Oh, speaking of help, what about the Chinese fellow? He's in the country illegally, you know? Hmm, any ideas? Not right offhand. We'll work it out when I get back. In the meantime, you can stay with my driver. Well, feel free, a full run of the place. Wish I had time to show my gym out back. He can find his way around any gym blindfolded. With you around, he'd be crazy to even think about the gym. Go on. Get out of here while you still got a chance. Ah, I may only be a fight promoter. But I've learned to defend myself. Hold it. I don't want nobody messing up my honeymoon. Well, it looks like Charley decided not to stay with the driver. We'll figure out some other arrangement. You go on. Don't worry about that. We'll work it out. OK, I'll see you in a few days. Right. Well, what now? [MOCKING] Oh, well, now don't worry about thing. We'll work something out. Oh. [music playing] [car horn] Well, where is it? Sir, we were unable to get it. Well, then why are you here? There was unexpected trouble-- Look, I don't want to hear excuses. You get that Buddha, or I'll show you what real trouble is. Yes, Mr. King. [shower] [door knock] Hold your horses. I'll be there in a second. You've got just three seconds to open up. I'm going to break down the door. All right, all right, I'm coming. [door knock] Now, what's so all-mighty important that you have to crash the door down for? You. Sometimes I just don't know what I'm going to do with you. Oh, that's easy. You just do whatever comes natural to you. OK. Wait a minute. My mama says that the honeymoon is over when a man and woman shares the same bathroom. Your mama's got nothing to do with this. And furthermore, the bathroom should be a place of privacy. Hey! What kind of jive is this? MARLENE: That's not jive. That's just the way it is. I'm coming in. Calvin Jefferson-- You got anything else you want to teach me? Yeah, why don't you dry up and go put back those bedsheets. Ooh, yes, master. Don't scrub too hard. It might wash off. [music playing] CALVIN: Aha! I leave you alone for only a few minutes. And already, you're carrying on with another man. See? But baby, I thought it would be more fun if we had an orgy. An orgy? With him? He doesn't look too capable. No, he doesn't, does he? What about you? Oh, I don't know. I need about two or three more women. After me, you wouldn't even be interested. What are you waiting for? Hi. CALVIN: Where are you? Ah, there. I can feel you. God, it's really dark in here. What's so funny? MARLENE: All that talk about black being beautiful. CALVIN: Yeah, but you got to see it to appreciate it. [music playing] [bees] What's that? I don't know. A buzzing sound. Yeah, it sounds sort of like uh-- like, uh, ouch! What's the matter? Something stung me. Ow! Honey. Bees! Bees! Bees! Bees! [screaming] Bees! Bees! [screaming] [splash] [bees] [fighting sounds] [gong] [non-english speech] Open it up. Ya! It's got to be there. Again. Ya! [crash] Again. Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! [crash] Get out. Get me Ambrose. [boxing sounds] Oh, it's all right, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on. Come one. That's it. Put them up. Now. Like that. OK? No, no, Charley. No, no, no. Like this. Yeah. OK, now. Do what I do. OK? Like that. Yeah. Yeah, like that. Yeah. Look at me. No, no, no. We don't do that in boxing. Like that. Yeah. Now, like that. Like that. [music playing] [punching] Hey, Charley. I'm sorry. Come on. Sorry, Charley. Look. Sorry, really. [spitting] OK, Charley, have it your way. [punching] [crash] Wait a minute. Maybe you can teach me some of that stuff. Oh, no, you read some of that. No, no. No, wait, you teach me. Yeah. Yeah, right. Right. [smacking] Oh. Oh. Time out. I've got a man here who wants to ask a few questions. Captain Gonzalez, I'd like you to meet my husband, Calvin Jefferson. Yes, Captain, what can I do for you. I'm investigating the robbery that happened last night. Yeah? Don't you think it's strange that someone should go to all that trouble just to steal a worthless wooden Buddha? Yeah. You do? Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Well, uh, Mr. Jefferson, uh, why do you find it strange? Probably for the same reason you do. Well, yes, but uh, but then why is that? I don't know. Suppose you tell me. Well, because it's uh, uh, well, because it's strange, that's all. Yes, well, we both agree on that. We do? Look, Captain, what are you trying to say? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, unless of course, you don't mind. Mind what? Well, I'm not saying anything. But uh, do you mind if we just pretend for a few minutes. Pretend? No, I don't mind. Good. So whatever I say doesn't mean that it's so, OK? OK, I'll bite. What isn't so? Now, what if the Buddha was more than just a Buddha? Yeah. What if it only looked like a Buddha from the outside and, in fact, was not a Buddha from the inside? What would you have then? I don't know. Suppose you tell me. All right, I will. You have a perfect smuggling device. Hey, this is getting interesting. A smuggling device for what? I don't know. I haven't figured that one out yet. I was hoping that since it was your Buddha, you might tell me. Look, Captain, my wife and I bought a Buddha in Hong Kong. It was just a plain, ordinary, hand-carved, wooden Buddha not even worth $20 that somebody stole last night. Yeah, but doesn't that seem strange to you? Yes, it does. Then we do agree. Thank you very much, Mr. Jefferson. You've been very helpful. I'll be in touch. I can find my way out. Good day. Good day. Why did you do it? I didn't. [click] Somebody pulled a double cross. If it wasn't you, then who? Soroka. [click] No. [barrel spin] He had too much at stake to risk it. It had to be you. No one else knew about it. It wasn't me. [click] How do I know that? You don't. You just have to believe me. I'm not in the habit of repeating myself. [gunshot] Is it possible that the black man discovered the contents of the Buddha and made a switch? It's possible. There's a Chinaman who seems to be close by wherever the black goes. It might be a link. Look into it. How do you want me to handle it? No rough stuff. Use a subtle approach. I don't want to arouse any more suspicion than necessary. I'll see what they can find out. I may need Pandora's help. [running sounds] [kids playing] [boat horns] [boat horns] Cal Jefferson, right? Right. Johnny Galvez, freelance writer. What are you doing in Asia? Honeymoon. Honeymoon. You mean you've got to work out on your honeymoon. Got to keep in shape. My little buddy Charley. He keeps me company. Hi, Charley. I'm Johnny. You, uh, you in pretty good shape for a writer. I usually work out in the mornings then grab a quick massage before I pound the typewriter. Hey, maybe I can do a story on you. How about it? Uh, on one condition. You name it. That I have final approval on anything that you write. Fair enough, you've got a deal. Come on, now, I'll interview you over a massage. Come on. Hey, Charley. "King's Massage Clinic." Looks like a massage parlor, Captain. Here, let me see. "King's Massage Clinic." You're right, it does look like a massage parlor. That's what I said. Look, I know that's what you said, Ricardo. But are you willing to let it go at that? Huh? Look, just because it looks like a massage parlor doesn't necessarily mean that it's a massage parlor, huh? Uh-huh. Sir, please. Yours, sir. Yours is over there. [music playing] Don't you worry about the thing. Just come with me. It's OK, Charley. Just do what the lady wants. Come on. It looks like your little friend doesn't know what he's in for. Him? What about me? Man, if my little bride could see me now. It's OK. I'll hang it right here where you can see it. You can go. I'll handle this one myself. Where is he from? Who? Oh, Charley? That's a long story. The strong, silent type, huh? You don't trust anybody, do you? Whatever it is you've got in that bag, it must be very valuable. No comment? Relax. You can trust me. You know, I think you're interviewing the wrong man. How's that? Well, your line of questioning-- it all relates to Charley. I was just curious. I mean, it does seem a bit odd for a prize fighter on his honeymoon to be traveling with a Chinese bodyguard. Your writers take a lot for granted, don't you? I'm not sure I read you. Well, for one thing, he's not my bodyguard. Oh? Then what is he? Let's just say he's a buddy of mine. And we'll leave it that, OK? You sound like a man who's trying to hide something. You never know, I just might be. Don't you think it's about time we got to know each other a little better. I don't get it. What kind of a deal are you talking about? It's simple. I know all about it. So I can cut this, gee, I don't know crap. But if you know all about it, suppose you fill me in. I'm afraid you don't quite understand me. Name your price. My price? My price for what? Don't be a smartass, Jefferson. There was nothing in the Buddha. What the hell is the matter with you? Don't you understand? [music playing] Look, you get me now. Me, for that. [fighting sounds] [crash] [punch] Hold it. It's in that bag. [punching] [rummaging] It's not here. I'll give you an easy choice. You can tell me where it is now, or if you want, after I work your little friend over. You're wasting your time. I told you I don't know. [nunchucks] [crash] [fighting sounds] [explosion] Here, Charley, let's go. Hold it! Hold it right there. All right, put your hands up. Up! [explosion] Look, baby, we got to be reasonable about this. You're darn right. The way I see it, the only decent most thing to do is to get on out of this filthy hotel. But there's got to be a logical answer. Logic doesn't mean a thing when the question comes up at gunpoint. But if we leave now, we'll never find out what this is all about. Are you crazy? Hey, I don't want to know. [door knock] Oh, it's you, Captain. Come on in. You ran off and left these things behind. I thought, you might be needing them. Well, where are you going? We're leaving on the first available plane. Well, you just can't do that. Why not? Because your husband and his accomplice here are under arrest. Under arrest for what? The charges are as follows-- creating a public disturbance, visiting a place of ill repute, assaulting an officer, resisting arrest, and indecent exposure. You can't be serious. I want to inform you that you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you. Hey, wait just a minute there. Look, I was fighting for my life. And since when can you arrest a man for getting a massage, huh? I did not assault any officer. And another thing, I was not indecently exposed because I was wearing a towel. But besides all that, you know, why do you think I called you to come out here? Just so you could, uh, arrest me? Uh, why did you call? To try and explain to you what happened and to tell you that your theory about the Buddha was correct. What about the Buddha? I don't know. But apparently, there was something inside it. CAPTAIN GONZALEZ: And what would that something be? Oh, man I haven't got the faintest idea. Well, then, it looks like you're not under arrest after all. What do you intend to do? Well, as far as I'm concerned, the case is closed. Look, mister, you don't understand. They tried to rough him up. And they may try it again. Now, I want to know what you intend to do about it. As far as I'm concerned, the case is far from being closed. Who said the case is closed? You did. I did? Yeah. Oh, that. Well, I was talking about the charges against your husband. The case of the missing is still unresolved. And I must ask you to delay your departure until after I complete my investigation. Thank you, and good day. Good day. He can't do that, can he? Looks like he just did. So you failed. Do you definitely feel the black man is involved? AMBROSE: I'm sure of it. Are you aware of the significance of that pouch? Yes, Mr. King, I am. Then you realize we must succeed. We cannot fail. We must not take any more chances. I want you to arrange a meeting with the prize fighter. AMBROSE: Any particular way you want this done? Or can I choose my own methods? Ambrose, I don't give a damn how you do it, just so long as I get that pouch. Oh! [splash] [fighting sounds] It serves you right. What's that supposed to mean? It's something wrong when a girl on her honeymoon feels neglected and lonely. I got to keep in shape. What I had in mind wouldn't exactly put you out of shape. Well, there's never a day a guy gets another crack at Kung Fu. Come here, and I'll Kung Fu you. [fighting sounds] I think she's going into the house, sir. What do you mean you think she's going into the house? Is she going into the house? Or is she not going into the house? RICARDO: Neither. CAPTAIN GONZALEZ: Well, ten what is she doing? RICARDO: I don't know. CAPTAIN GONZALEZ: What do you mean you don't know? Here. Give me that. Where is she? Uh, I think she is in the house, sir. How come you always think when you should see and see when you should think? Huh? Look, from now on, no more thinking. Just what you see, OK? OK, sir. Hmm, she's coming out of the house, sir. All right, you've had your chance. Now, it's going to cost you. Where do you think you're going? I know where I'm going-- out to spend some money. Well, promise me one thing. What's that? You won't buy any more Buddhas. You mean to say you're going to actually let me go? [kick] [crash] Sure. Why not? Well, what about the gangsters? What if the decide to attack me? Maybe you can hit him with your purse? Marlene. The car is coming this way, sir. All right, get with her tail and stay on her. Sir? I mean follow her. Follow her. Oh, yes, sir. [music playing] What the-- Shut up. Just do as I say. And you won't get hurt. Get dressed. We're going to walk out of here through the rear of the store. I'm warning you, don't try anything. [curtain] Get out! Get out! [curtain] [gong] What's going on here? What is this? [phone ringing] Hello? LEO [ON PHONE]: Calvin Jefferson. Yeah. Hello, Cal, I don't know why they brought me here. They just forced me to come with them-- Marlene? Mr. Jefferson, I've got your wife. And you've got something that I want. Now, I'm willing to make a deal. But I don't know what you want. Mr. Jefferson, you're gambling with your wife's life. CALVIN [ON PHONE]: You got to believe me. I don't have anything. I've sent a car pick to pick you up. And I would advise that you bring it with you. And one more thing, if you tip the police or mention this to anyone, your wife is as good as dead. [slam] [slam] [crash] Now, hold it, Charley. This is one time you're definitely not coming along. Look, you don't understand, Charley, you're not going. [punch] [car starting] [music playing] [tires squealing] No, you better stay here. I don't know whose side you're on. Calvin! LEO: Yes, Mr. Jefferson, your wife is OK and will continue to be so, providing, of course, that you brought the pouch with you. Look, you don't understand. I don't know anything about any pouch. There's got to be some kind of a mistake. Well, perhaps you can be persuaded to speak the truth. Tang? [fighting sounds] [punch] [punch] [punching] [crash] Where is it? [slap] [scream]. All right. Everybody with their hands up. That includes you, Mr. Jefferson. [punching] Hold it! That's it. That's the pouch. Back up against the wall. Untie her. [helicopter] Ambrose, out the back door. Chris-- [fighting sounds] Help! Help! Help! Ahh! [fighting sounds] [crash] [fighting sounds] [nunchucks] [fighting sounds] B125, B125, this is Eagle 4. Come in, over. MAN [ON RADIO]: Come in, Eagle 4. Come in, Eagle 4. Need immediate assistance. Repeat, immediate assistance. Location, King's Enterprises factory compound. Repeat, King's Enterprises factory compound. MAN [ON RADIO]: 10-4. 10-4. [music playing] [gunshots] [ricochet] [gunshot] [nunchucks] [fighting sounds] [nunchucks] [splash] [water spraying] [fighting sounds] [fighting sounds] Ya! Ahh! Ahh! Ah! [gunfire] [ricochets] [gunfire] Marlene! MARLENE: Cal, Calvin! Oh, Cal! Oh, Cal. Leo! [helicopter] Leo! Wait! Leo! [sirens] Give me that. Hold it! Hold it! Cal. [tasting] Does this mean anything to you? No. What is this? I don't know. But its supposed to be powerful enough to control the whole world. You must be kidding. [lighter] See? [explosion] It's gunpowder. [laughter] [speaking chinese] [music playing]
