- [Mark] Hey-o, Ryan! Hey! - Hey. - [Mark] Look at this! - Oh, man. - [Mark] It's our new camera. It's got a microphone and everything. - We're legit now. - [Mark] Yeah, man, it's pretty cool, right? - Yeah. (uneasy electronic music) (birds chirping) (leaves crumbling) - [Mark] Here we go. No, not that way, this way. (branches crackling) - [Ryan] Look at all these fuckin' branches here. - [Mark] Yeah, be careful. (wind blowing) Oh shit, man. Look, there's a fuckin' woman. - [Ryan] Must be his wife. - I didn't plan for this. - What the fuck? - [Mark] Just give it a second. All right, she went back inside. - Should we still go? Should we still do this? - [Mark] Fuck it. - Yeah? - Don't worry about it. Masks on. - All right. - [Mark] Looks good. (laughs) - You ready? - Yeah. - Here, gimme the camera, you take the knife. - [Mark] All right. - [Ryan] Put your mask on. (chuckles) - Oh, I almost forgot. All right, here, let's go. (laughs) (wind chimes ringing) Get a shot of that, get a shot of that. Welcome to their home. You ready? - [Ryan] Yeah. (knocking) (woman shrieks) (breathing heavily) - [Mark] You scream, you die, you understand? Do you fuckin' understand? - Yeah. - Here, take the fucking knife! Gimme the camera! Go fuckin' find him. - All right. - Gimme that. What are you doing? You're very attractive, do you know that? - Please, please don't assault me. - [Mark] Assault you? Assault you? Is that you what you think we are? Rapists? Is that what you think? - [Ryan] Hey, he's not here. - [Mark] What do you mean he ain't here? - I don't know, he's not here. What the fuck do we do? - [Mark] Huh, where's he at? - Who? - [Mark] Don't play dumb, your husband! Huh? - [Stacy] He went out. - [Mark] He went out? - He'll be back. He'll be back soon. Just please. - [Ryan] What's the matter with her? Fuck. - [Mark] What's the matter with you, huh? You camera shy? - Please! - Aw, are you camera shy? - [Stacy] Please. - [Mark] Please, please. She's shy as hell in front of the camera. Look, she won't even face it. I can't even get your pretty little face. - [Ryan] What's your name? What's your name? - [Stacy] Stacy. - [Ryan] Stacy? That's a pretty name. What do you think? - [Mark] Stacy, do you know your husband's an asshole? We will find out soon enough. - What do you wanna do? - [Mark] Um. Let's just take her and do a thorough search of the house. Pick her up, fuck it. - [Ryan] All right. Come on, Stacy. - [Mark] Come on, Stacy. - [Ryan] Come on. - [Stacy] Please no. - Fuck. - Get up. - [Mark] Here, here, take the knife. - [Ryan] Remember, Stacy, walk right here. Come on! - [Mark] Come on, walk! Let's see what's behind this door. Keep fuckin' going! Hold on, hold on, let me get this fuckin'... All right, is this good? Good? All right, keep goin'. Where the fuck does this lead? The fuckin' dungeon? Oh, very spacious. Very nice, Stacy. Oh! I see we got a little weight bench. Very nice, let me see. (lock clattering) Where you goin', Stacy? Holy shit! Look at that. - [Ryan] Jeez. - [Mark] We can have a nice fuckin' party with that, huh? - Yeah, we can. - Huh, Stacy? Do you wanna party with us? A little bit of booze, huh? - You wanna have some fun? - [Mark] You wanna have a little bit of fun with us? Come on. Huh, Stacy, have a little party? - A little party? - [Mark] Here you go. What the fuck is this room? Looks like a little laundry area kind of a thing. (Stacey screams) Huh, huh, Stacey? Aw, does that hurt a little bit? He pull a little bit too tight? All right, let's take her to that other room. I haven't been in there yet. Let's see. Let's see what's in here. Come on, keep goin'. Oh! All right. There you go. Why don't you take a look at all this stuff, huh? We got all kinds of stuff here. I think it's some type of fuckin' storage area or somethin'. What's on that coat rack? Anything? Anything good, Stacy, huh? Anything good over there? - [Ryan] Look at all this shit. - [Mark] Oh! What is that, an overcoat? I wanna see how that shit looks on you. - [Ryan] Okay. - [Mark] Come on. Oh my goodness. - How do I look? - [Mark] You're fucking stylin' now, man. - Yeah? - [Mark] That's that rich people shit. Stacy, what's he look like? - What do you think? - [Mark] Business man? Look like, huh, he look like your husband? - You know what? I think she's jealous. I got something for you too, Stacy. - [Mark] Stacy, you're about to have a slight wardrobe malfunction. Anyways, (chuckles) I'm trying to pay attention over here. Okay, here we go, he picked you out something nice. - [Stacy] Oh. - [Ryan] And this, get back. - [Mark] Okay. And, uh... - [Ryan] Oh my. Stacy, you look beautiful, what do you think? - [Mark] Huh, what do you think? - [Ryan] What do you think? - [Mark] He picked it out for you. - [Ryan] Huh, you don't like my taste? What do you think? Do you like it? - [Stacy] Yes. - [Mark] What was that? - Yeah. - What? - Yeah. Yeah. - [Ryan] Gimme this shit. Fuck this shit. - Fuckin' forget the clothes. (Mark sighs) I think I saw something over here, man. Oh, baby, look at that fuckin' driver, huh? Look at that fuckin' shit. Woo, this is the fuckin' legit. This is the fuckin' Pro-Am Tour shit or something. All right, let me practi... Oh, wait, no, let me just... I gotta get my practice swing in. Oh. Fuck. Chasin' Stacy. Oh, fuckin' pulled something. Here we go. And... (exhales) I think I shanked that one, but fuck it. I think... (club clanging) I think I, I think I could do it good here for real, for real. (muttering) Hands together, Stacy. - Please. - [Mark] And. Uh. Uh. Uh! (Stacy cries) I meant to hold it, I didn't mean that. - [Ryan] Where's all the film stuff anyway? - [Mark] Yeah, the posters and stuff. I mean, this is a storage area, but where the fuck are they? (Stacy sniffling) - This is just our summer home. - [Mark] What does that mean? - [Ryan] What? - It's just to relax. - [Ryan] The fuck? - [Mark] Just to relax? - It's just to relax. - Well, Stacy, aren't you relaxing? Come on. Wait, wait, wait, where you going? In the corner! Look at all this shit, huh. Wanna try it? Do a little shoppin'? Look at this. Huh? Look at that. How's that look, huh? - [Ryan] Perfect. - [Mark] Huh, like that? Fuckin' like that, huh? You like that? Your fuckin' clothes! Or your fuckin' rich people shit! You fuckin' like it? Huh? - Listen, you can have whatever you want. You can have what... I have some money in my wallet. (jewelry box clattering) - Money, you got money? Like this shit? You think we give a fuck about money? Do you think we give a fuck about bracelets, huh? Look at that. We don't give a fuck about money! - What do you want? What do you want? (exhales) - Quit asking so many fuckin' questions. Jesus, gimme a fuckin' headache. - [Ryan] You know, this isn't a bad place. - Nah, it's not. - [Ryan] I've always wanted to live in a place like this. - Man, me too. Hey, maybe Stacy here will sublet it to us. (laughs) - [Ryan] What do you think, Stacy? - We could be her roommates. (Ryan laughs) Holy shit. - [Ryan] What? - I didn't even fuckin' see this shit. - [Ryan] What's that? - Is this fuckin' creepy or what? - [Ryan] It's fucking terrifying. - This shit was just fuckin' laying here. (screeching) (laughing) Wait, wait, wait. Stacy. Stacy, you want to be my friend? Stacy? (Ryan snickering) - [Ryan] I don't think she's into it. - You know, Stacy, tryin' to have a good time here. What's your problem? Well, can you at least get that pissy look off your face? On with the tour. (urine splashing) Please, no full frontal. (laughs) Oh my. - [Ryan] Look, you upset Stacy. - Stacy. What can I say? When I gotta piss, I gotta piss. Whew. (toilet seat clanking) (toilet flushing) I shouldn't have drank that soda before we left. - [Ryan] Are we good now? - Yes, we're good. - [Ryan] Can we proceed? - (sighs) Yes, we can proceed. Fuckin' smart-ass, Stacy. Jeez, see what I deal with? - Don't. - Come on, where you goin'? Come on, let's go. And... (body thuds) Aw, Stacy, you gotta turn it like this. All right, stand right there. Right there. Look, it's the bedroom. - [Ryan] Where the magic happens. - Bow chicka. (laughing) (drawers clattering) (bed springs squeaking) What the fuck is this? You fuckin' see this shit? What? This is some pretty scantily-clad stuff. - [Ryan] Oh my god. - Stacy? Oh my goodness, I can't believe it. I think I love you now. You wanna take a whiff of this? - Uh-uh, I'm good. - Huh? - [Ryan] No, no, I'm good. - Just try it, see what happens. She's fuckin', she's fuckin' movin'! No, you don't! - [Ryan] Come back inside quickly! - Fuckin' bitch, look at that! Fuckin' doin', you stupid fuckin' bitch? Huh? My fuckin' arm! What the fuck are you doin'? Why'd you run, huh? Why the fuck did you run? You do that again, you're fuckin' dead. (tape squelching) Shut the fuck up. That's that. Oh, shit, here he comes. (Stacy crying) He already pulled in. You got this one? - Yeah. - Here, take the knife. Take the fuckin' cam. Oh, yeah, he's comin' home, and we're gonna get him. You ready, man? - [Ryan] Oh, fuck yeah. - [Mark] Let's fuckin' get this motherfucker. Stacy, can you shut the fuck up? We have to concentrate. - Stacy? Who the hell are you? Answer me! What are you doing in my house? - Shut the fuck up, John. Sit down. - Please don't. - [Mark] Get on the fucking couch with your wife. - [Ryan] Well, that was easy. - [Mark] It was easy. Where the fuck are you goin'? Where the fuck are you goin'? Huh? (Stacy crying) (Mark imitates crying) All right, let's turn on all these fuckin' lights. - Take the knife. - [Mark] All right, gimme. Get the ones in the fucking kitchen, too, just in case. Fucking red hat. Do you know what sit the fuck back is? Do you fucking get it? Do you see this fucking knife? I'll fucking cut your fucking throat. I don't give a fuck! (serene piano music) - Gentlemen, I don't have a lot of time. I'm a very busy man. - First off, thanks for seeing us. - Yeah, we really appreciate it. This is a lovely home, by the way. - Well, thank you. My wife Stacy and I, we use it when we can for vacation. Some people like the beach. We like the sticks. Anyway, what did you wanna ask me about? - We wanna get your thoughts on the script we pitched. - What was it about again? - You know, the one with the guy who's struggling to get over a breakup with his girlfriend? And then, through a series of surreal-like dreams, he eventually learns to get over her. - Oh yeah, that's right. You guys don't mind, do you? I'm starving. - No. - Uh, well, what'd you think? - Well, to be honest, I thought it was shit. - Shit? - What was wrong with it? - Tits. - Tits? - Yeah, where's the tits? - Tits, I... - Yeah, breasts, big beautiful breasts. - It's an art film. - Ah, people don't want art. They want action, horror, murder, you know, torture porn, tits and blood. None of that art garbage. That art stuff's unsellable. And quite frankly, my father, he wouldn't wipe his ass with that. - I mean, we could do another draft. - Listen, it's just not there. We're a real movie company. Maybe if you were established, but you two, let's face it, you're nobodies. What movies have you done? - Uh, this would be our first. - You see what I mean? (chewing loudly) - I mean, everybody's gotta start somewhere though. I know we're green, but somebody's gotta give us a chance. - Making this film is what's driving us to live, you know? We gotta make this film. We're artists. - It isn't going to be with my father's money. Look, guys, it's like this. Say you walk into a candy store, and you got all these options. You got the good stuff out in front, the all right stuff on the side, and then there's the stuff in the back. - Yeah? - You see, my position is deciding which stuff in the store I like. - [Mark] I don't understand. - Well, you two, you aren't even in the store, and you'll never be in the store, understand? - I mean, we have other ideas. We could go for those. - That won't be necessary. - [Ryan] Well, how 'bout some jobs then? I mean, we're pretty dedicated workers. We just wanna be around cinema. - I already got someone to get me coffee. - That's, that's not what I meant. - Look, guys, I got a few calls to make. I think it's best if you two just get outta here, all right? - Man. Okay. - Yeah. - Hey, guys, you know what you should do? Go buy a camera, make a few home movies, and leave the real movies to us professionals. Have a good day. - [Ryan] They're on. - They're on? - Yeah. - [Mark] Take the fucking knife. Put it on these fuckin' assholes. (Stacy cries) Show 'em. - It's us! - Aw, you remember him? Huh? How 'bout me, motherfucker? Do you remember me? - You remember? - [Mark] Look, he's speechless. He doesn't know what to say. Let me ask you a question. Does my friend look like a guy to go get coffee? No, he's an actor, a filmmaker. We're filmmakers. - Why didn't you give the script a chance? Why be so fucking mean about it? - [Mark] You think all that money gives you the right to say what you did? - I was just trying to be honest. I didn't wanna get your hopes up. - Bullshit, you wanted to embarrass us. - I could've said it better. And for that, I'm sorry. As far as the script goes, let's just forget about all this, and let's hash it out like professionals. - [Mark] (chuckles) No, it's too late for that. You think you can play God with art because you have the money and the power? Well, somebody's gotta hold you accountable. - How do you know what the public likes if you don't even give them a chance to decide? - Come on, I know you guys are upset, but be upset at me. Let my wife go. - [Mark] Aw, your wife, Stacy? I don't think so. She's a part of this now. - Please! - [Mark] Please! You sound just like her. You know what, Ryan? Get the fucking tape. I'm sick of hearing this fuckin' guy talk. - Guys, come on, we can talk about this! - [Mark] Talk is over for now. (tape squelching) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) All right, let me do it. - Yeah. (camera shutter clicks) - All right. (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) All right. (heavy ominous music) (gunshot booms) (gunshot booms) (gunshot booms) (gunshot booms) All right, let's try this again. Hey, Ryan? - [Ryan] Yes, Mark? - You know that script idea we have? - [Ryan] Yeah, what about it? - How 'bout pitchin' that idea to the guy we met at the film festival? Um, you know, the one whose father owns a production company? - [Ryan] That's a good idea. I mean, we couldn't possibly finance it ourselves, and he was the only one willing to listen to us about the project. - Yeah, let's try it. Hi, my name's Mark, and this is Ryan. Um, we have this script idea. We'd love to pitch it to you. We think you'll love it. What do you say? Come on, nod your head. (Stacy pleads) Okay, so, the film idea. It's about this guy, an everyman, but he just broke up with his girlfriend. He's really having a hard time of it, but through a series of surreally dreams, he learns to get over her. Well, what do you think? Your silence is deafening. (Stacy weeps) Is it good? See that, Ryan? He likes it. - [Ryan] Would you ask your dad to finance it? - It's not a bad question, John. John, this is just, this is everything. You don't understand how much this means, the both of you. I couldn't have done it without you, man. We fuckin' did it. - [Ryan] We fuckin' did it. - [Mark] We fuckin' did it, everything. - Fuck, man. That's what I'm talking about. - All that fuckin' hard work. Oh my god, it just... (chuckles) You just don't... I'm speechless, really. Let me see these glasses. How do I look, Ryan? - [Ryan] Like a fuckin' asshole. - Like a fuckin' asshole? Like this fuckin' asshole, right? - [Ryan] Yeah. You see how much of a dick you look like to us? So, where was I? Oh, that's right. See, John, how easy it would've been? We could've quit our minimum wage jobs, and you could've had a quality picture for your daddy's company. - [Ryan] But that didn't happen. - No, it did not. You see, John, me and my friend Ryan, we come from nothing, where everybody's been told they're not good enough. Our daddies didn't own any banks. We didn't go to elite schools. - [Ryan] We're on the shoe of society. - I mean, that's a hell of a way to put it, but he's right. But you see, we love cinema. We wanna be a part of it. We wanna make it. And the only people standing in our way are people like you, people who couldn't even tell me the name of one Bergman or Tarkovsky film. You're in charge, that makes us sick. - [Ryan] Fucking disgusting. We wanna make meaningful films, not the garbage you and your peers put out. - But you stand in our way, you understand? That makes you evil. That makes you cruel. Yours is a symbol of cruelty! (Stacy sobs) Is this what you want? Is it? Bigshot, huh? How 'bout you? Is this what you want? Do you people like this? Torture porn, whore? Will this sell enough fuckin' tickets, huh? If I slit your fuckin' throat right fuckin' now? Huh, is this what the fucking kids want? Is it? (Stacey bawling) Shut the fuck up! Our shit isn't any good enough, no? How 'bout tits? Remember, Ryan, big beautiful tits? How 'bout your wife's tits? What if I fucking cut 'em off, huh? Huh? (John groaning) Yeah, you fuckin' move again, you fuckin' talk, I'll cut her fuckin' throat. I don't give a fuck. (Stacy wailing) Do I look like I give a flying fuck? Do you give a fuck, Ryan? Do you fucking give a shit? - [Ryan] I do not. - So who the fuck's gonna help you? Who's gonna fuckin' help you? Who's taking this fuckin' knife away from me? No-fucking-body. We're in fuckin' charge now, motherfucker! Our script wasn't any fuckin' good enough, no? It was shit, according to you? Who the fuck are you? Look me in the eyes and tell me I'm not any good! Look me in the fuckin' eyes and tell me I'm not any good if you wanna fuckin' say somethin'! Tell me now, motherfucker! Tell me! Tell me! Huh, do you wanna fuckin' say anything? Am I not any fucking good? I ain't got what it takes? He ain't a good actor? No? Go get fuckin' coffee? What the fuck's the matter with you? Who the fuck are you to tell me? Give me the fuckin' camera! Give me the fuckin' camera! Well, go ahead, Ryan, tell 'em. This is your chance. It's every person that told you you weren't good enough. It's every casting director that never called you back. Where you goin'? Huh? (drawer slams) (faucet running) (drawer slams) (Stacy crying) - Here, I wanted to audition for your coffee assistant. Oops, guess I'm not gonna get the job. - [Mark] (chuckles) Oh my god. What's the bread for? That's what I'm talking about. - The bread is because this cocksucker wouldn't stop shoving his face with food while we were pitching him our fuckin' idea. How the fuck do you like that, huh? You think you know what people want, huh? You don't even know what art is! You're the fuckin' death of cinema. - [Mark] Oh my god, this is too fuckin' funny. Look at this fuckin' shirt. - I wanna eat something. - [Mark] Oh my god. He's fucking beside himself. Look at him. Oh my goodness, all right, all right. Let's take this tape off, come on. I can't grab it. Oh, no, I got it. Oh, there we go. And it's off. - It's time for you to pitch us. - [Mark] Yeah, tell us why we shouldn't kill you and your wife. - Just let us go. - [Mark] Let you go? - [Ryan] We can't. - [Mark] Not until you tell us why we shouldn't kill you both. - I'm sorry. I was wrong, and you were right. Just let me and my wife go. If this is about your film, I can talk to my dad. I can convince him. - [Mark] Well, what'd you think, Ryan? - I think it was shit. - [Mark] Yeah, me too. You see, John, it's like this. So you go into a candy store and you got all these options. You got the good stuff in the front, the all right stuff in the middle. Then, you got the stuff in the back. (chuckles) You see, we remember everything you said to us. - [Ryan] Including your shitty advice. - [Mark] Yeah, what do you think about our home movie? (laughing) You see that? We're not gonna let you go, not yet. - [Ryan] Nope. - [Mark] Put the tape back on him. First, we're gonna have ourselves a little bit of fun. - Yeah, it's way too tense in here. - All right, come on, Stacy. Come on, come on. Don't worry, John, I'm not gonna hurt her. Come on, just bring it in close. Where you goin', where you goin'? Come on, that's it. We're just gonna move. Just goin' from side to side like a slow dance. Come on. - [Ryan] We need some music. - No, we don't need no music. We don't need it, do we, Stacy? Nah, I been saving something, something that special sorta girl. You know what I mean, John? Come on. (humming whimsically) (Ryan laughs) Oh, how'd she do? It was good? I mean, look at her. She can't even keep her balance. Stacy, you know your arms are tied, not your legs. (laughs) Oh, but you know, you're a real fucking downer, Stacy. I'm here tryin' to slow dance with you. You can't stand on your fucking feet. All right, I'm sick of this. It's not what I thought it was gonna be. You wanna take over? Why don't you dance with her? Come on, get over there. Stay, stay. Get on out there, Tiger. Come on, don't be shy. - Come on, let's just do this. - [Mark] Come on, give us a couple of steps, a couple of moves. - All right, fuck. - [Mark] Oh shit. Come on, how 'bout a twist? Oh, snap. Come on, Stacy, join him. Don't let him twist by himself. - Come on, come on. - [Mark] Come on, twist! - Come on! - [Mark] Twist! Make her twist. Get those shit, yeah, yeah. That's some twist, Stacy. (Stacy sobbing) Jeez, oh, man. - What? - [Mark] She's just not into it, man. - She's bummin' me the fuck out. - [Mark] Come on, Stacy. You never did a fuckin' twist before? Jesus. - [Stacy] I don't wanna do this please. - The fuck was that? - I don't wanna do it. - [Mark] You don't wanna do it? Do the fuckin' twist. - Turn around. (Stacy shrieking) - [Mark] Oh my god, Stacy. - [Ryan] Get the fuck down. - [Mark] Oh my goodness. Oh, look at this, dude. Wait a minute, look at me, look at me. Holy shit. - Leave him alone please. - [Mark] Hey, Ryan, you give me a towel? - Yeah. - Oh my goodness. You look like shit, John. You too, Stacy, but especially John. Jeez. There he is. - Clean this motherfucker up. - [Mark] Yeah, well, that's what I'm gonna try and do. Let me see. It's hard to do some multitasking, and it's not the greatest. There you go. There you go. That will do ya. All right. That's a little better. - Shut the fuck up. - [Mark] Uh, maybe not. Fuck it. (knocking) - Who's that? - [Mark] I don't know. (both screaming) - Shut the fuck up. What do we do? - [Mark] Don't make any fuckin' noise. You see the fuckin' knife still? (knocking) On or way, hold on! All right, let me think. Give me the fuckin' knife, take the camera, and I'll deal with it. I'll deal with it. Just gimme the fuckin'... Here, just sit where I was. - [Ryan] All right. - I'm coming, don't worry. Hi, officer, what's the problem? - [Officer] There's a report of a robbery taking place at this address. - What? - [Officer] This your home? - [Mark] Yeah, of course. - [Officer] Can I see some identification? - Yeah, let me... (Mark sighs) You're gonna kill me, but I actually lost my wallet today. It's actually a pretty funny story. - [Officer] You lost your wallet? - Yeah. - [Officer] Is there a reason why you're holding this door like this? - No. - [Officer] And I can take a look inside? - [Mark] I mean, is that really necessary, officer? - [Officer] Yeah, step aside please. - [Stacy] Help! Help! - What the hell is this? (Stacy crying) Step back. - Thank you. They broke into our house. They tied us up. They fucking tried to kill us. They're crazy. - All right, all right. Everything's gonna be okay. I'm gonna get you guys to safety. You don't have to worry about anything now, all right? Everything's in my hands now. (laughing) Oh my goodness. Um, I'm sorry. - What? - Oh, all right, oh my goodness, man. All right. - Just tell 'em, just tell 'em. - This is just a costume. Oh, man. You believe this, this? - How you gonna believe this? - Oh, man. - You can see it says Trooper. - This is like, Trooper? - I mean. - Like what? - [Ryan] I mean, otherwise, it looked pretty real. - Aw, man, jeez. - I'm being honest. You had me going with the hat. And then I opened the door, and holy shit. - I bought this at the little costume shop. It was really cheap. It's all they had. - Look at this. Look how they... Oh my gosh. - This is cardboard, like they gave me my Chinese food in. (laughing) - [Ryan] Aw, man, well. - Sorry, I'm late. I had to babysit my brother. You know how it is at times. - Don't worry about it! Don't worry! - Oh my goodness. - Wait a minute, like, I'm glad you came, honestly, because... - I'm glad I made it, man. - I'm sick of holdin' the camera. - Oh yeah, I can take that from you, my man. - Thank god. - Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, let me just tell her. Wait, wait, let me get this. So, this is actually Donte. He's actually the third member of our crew. - Third. One, two, three, that's me here, yeah. - So that means he's not a cop. - [Donte] Surprise, yeah. - Do you see? Are you putting it all together right now? You're very smart, Stacy, but not smart enough. - I know, it's kind of unfortunate, but... There you go, let me grab that for you. (Stacy crying) - [Mark] All right. - [Donte] All right. - Who are you? - [Donte] Look at them all, crying and everything. - Who are you? (laughing) - Oh my goodness. - Who are you? - [Donte] Oh, man, okay. - Who are you guys? - Oh... - That's... That's an 18 millimeter, by the way. - [Donte] 18 millimeters, bet. - [Mark] So, I don't know. Do you think we should change lenses? - [Donte] I mean, this is fine. It caught everything I wanted it to catch. (laughing) - Oh yeah. - Aw, shit. (birds chirping) - [Mark] What is art? - Anything can be art. The way a tree looks. The shape of the clouds in the sky. Peoples' expressions, images, sounds. Happiness, sadness. Pain and death, all of these are art. Anything can be art. - [Mark] And what are we? - Artists. - [Mark] And what are those that stand against our art? - Evil. - You good? Can you see me now? - [Donte] Yeah, we're all good here. - All right, picture's up. You guys want anything to eat or anything like that? - [Donte] Nah, I'm fine, I ate before I got here. - You did? What about you? - I'm good. - Nothin'? - I'm all right. - I mean, now I'm really... Aw, they got some weird shit. I mean, I'm more thirsty than hungry, you know what I mean? - Yeah. - They should have a fuckin' mug or something. - [Donte] It's in one of these cabinets. - I don't want that fuckin' shit. There we go. Shit. - [Donte] Smiley face. - Look how cool this shit is. - [Donte] Tap water? - I don't know. I got the hot water, too, I don't know. (Donte groans) I bet it's fuckin' disgusting. Let me just see. Eh, it's all right. Like I said, I'm just fuckin' thirsty. - [Donte] Oh, shit, I almost forgot to tell you guys. I brought a surprise for you. - Oh yeah? - [Donte] Yeah, I left it outside by the door. - [Ryan] All right, let's check it out. - What'd you bring? - [Donte] Oh, you'll see. It's awesome as shit, though. - Now you got me curious. - [Donte] (chuckles) Trust me, you're gonna love it. (Stacy whimpering) - What? - Look at that. - Where'd you get this? What? - [Donte] It's fuckin' awesome, isn't it? - Oh my goodness. - It's more than it could be. - It's my dad's. - Let me see it. Let me see it, let me see it. Holy shit. - [Donte] I didn't know if you wanted me to bring it, so I just said fuck it, yeah? You like it, huh? - I like it. See? Now it's good to go. - Yeah. - Oh my goodness. - [Donte] Go ahead, try it out, man. - Try it out? - [Donte] I think we got two over there. Why not? - That's a good idea. - Please. - Don't you fuckin' point it at her! - [Mark] Hey, you guys wanna play a game? - Please don't do this. (John yelling) My husband was just doing his job, please. - Just doing his job? Just doing his job, Ryan, do you hear this? - Just doing his job. - What the fuck? - She's defending her shit husband, I can't believe it. Listen, you don't know shit. Where was I? Uh, so who's it gonna be? Is it gonna be? (John mumbling) Wait, come on, come back. Is it gonna be... Is it gonna be the lovely Stacy or asshole John? What do you think? - I'm not sure. Why don't we let fate decide? - All right, how 'bout we do this? I'll close my eyes. I'll point the barrel like this. (Stacy crying) Ryan, spin me around. Fuck it. - All right, all right. Not me. And whoever, hold it. Whoever it lands on in here, we'll put her over there, and whoever it lands on, you're gonna fuckin' die. - [Donte] Wait, wait, let me get the fuck out the way real quick. - No, I mean, I could just move you out. I'll be like, Donte's over there. - [Donte] No, I'm just gonna take a couple of steps back, you know? I don't wanna get shot in the fuckin' face. - You're fuckin' insane. - It's really for them two. - [Mark] All right, your turn. - Please, no, I don't wanna do it! Please - Come on back. Come on. - Please stop! - [Ryan] Come on. You wanna do this hard? (Stacy screaming) - [Mark] I'll fuckin' kill you. - Now, get the fuck up! - Get the fuck over! - Chill out! (John yells) Shut the fuck up. - All right. - Hold up. You ready? - You'll be okay. - Yeah. - It's gonna be okay. - Now, you ready? Your eyes closed? - [Mark] My eyes are closed. - [Ryan] All right. Who's it gonna be? - You're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. - Who's it gonna be? - Oh shit. - Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be? - How many rotations? - It's gonna be fine. - Who's it gonna be? - No, John. (Stacy screams) Stop! Don't do this, please! (John yelling) - [Mark] I'm sorry, Stacy. I'm sorry. - Don't do it please. Don't do this, please don't do this! Please don't do this! (trigger clicks) (Stacey screams) - It's not loaded. It's not loaded. - No, not this again! John, he's crazy! - Look at that. - John! - It's empty, calm the fuck down. - Just do it. Just do it. Just kill us. Kill us or don't fuckin' kill us. - Kill you? We're not gonna kill you, not yet. How 'bout another game? - Actor's workshop. - That's actually a really great idea. - Here, you take the knife. I got the gun. - You can just put it over there in the corner. (Stacy sobbing) What is actor's workshop? - Pay attention. - We're gonna give you a scene, and you and Stacy are gonna act it out. You understand? Now, I'm gonna take this tape off. If you make any noise, call for help, call me a motherfucker, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. I'm gonna fuckin' take this knife and stab you right in the fuckin' chest. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's very important. - [Stacy] Fuck. - [Mark] Shut the... (Donte chuckles) I'm trying to explain actor's workshop, and you won't shut the fuck up. Do you get it? Maybe we should put the fuckin' tape back on you, you stupid fuckin' bitch. Jesus Christ. - God damn. - Okay, I'm sorry. Stacy, I didn't mean that. - It's all right, keep going. - All right. (clears throat) Where were we, oh, the tape. I'm gonna take it off now. It's up to you what happens next, understand? There we go. All right, so let me set the scene. Stacy, pay attention. You just lost your job, and you gotta break the bad news to John, okay? - [Ryan] Have they got any lines? (Mark sighs) - I don't know. Let's just improvise. - Yeah. - It'll be easy on all of us. - Okay. - Um, all right, as far as the blocking, this is, like, kind of a weird way to have a conversation. (stammering) I want Stacy up on her feet. And then I'm gonna... Do you think it would look nice if she just came kinda into the scene? - Yeah, and then we'll have her sit down. - We'll have her sit down. - Okay. - All right, let's pick her. Come on, up to your feet. Come on. Come on. - Now we got stuff here. - [Mark] There we go. - Okay? - All right, so you good? Oh well, okay. So, you got him? You got him all framed? - Oh yeah. - Don't be afraid to kinda push in. - [Donte] Oh, no doubt. - But keep him in focus if you can, obviously. Um... You have to speak up! It's not the greatest microphone. It's kind of a low budget kind of a thing. - Yeah. - But you have to... You gotta raise your voice. - [Donte] Projection, you know, like... - [Ryan] We didn't get the money we needed. - [Donte] We're broke. (stammering) I guess that's why we're here. - You're fuckin crazy. (laughing) - [Donte] I know. - [Mark] Okay. So I'm gonna step outta the way. I'm gonna let you guys do your thing. Does everybody understand what's happening? Do we get the scene? Do we understand the gist? Improvise. All right. Let's see what happens. Let's give it a go. - [Donte] Yeah. - [Mark] And action. - [Donte] Come on. - Hey John. - [Mark] Come on, keep goin'. You need a little help? - I lost. I lost my... Come on. - I lost, I lost. - I lost my job. - [Mark] Lost your job, come on. - I... (exhales) I lost my job. - (stammering) You did? - Yes. - Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck was that? Just cut. Wait, whoa, whoa, cut, cut, cut. John, what's your problem? Where's your emotion? This is a big deal for you. Stacy, like, you're sad, but I also want you to be a little nervous, a little bit frightened, 'cause you don't know what he's gonna say. You don't know what he's gonna think. I want it to be kinda like, you know, like a slow burn kind of a thing. Um... Let's just try it again. Do a little bit better, John, okay? Back, first positions, come on. Come on. - Come on. - [Mark] Take her back over, first positions. - Stand right here. - [Mark] All right. - Everybody ready? - Come on! - Don't look at me. - [Mark] Why are you lookin' at him for? We're gonna go for it again. Same lines, from the top. And action. (Stacy sniffling) - Hey, John. I have some bad news. - (stammering) What is it? - I lost my job. - (stammering) You did? What happened? - Cut! John, come on, man, what are you doing? You're at here, that's like a 30. I need you up here at like 100. Do you understand this is... (sighs) Where's the emotion? I just don't understand why you can't do it. Ryan? Could you just show him how it's done please? - [Ryan] Sure. John, get the fuck up! - Get the fuck up, John, jeez. - Come on, John. - [Ryan] Jeez, fuck. - Yep, come on over. He's gonna show you how it's done. Take as long as you need. - Yeah, I just gotta get ready. (shivering) (moaning) Okay. - You good? - All right, yeah. - [Mark] All right. And action. Go ahead. - I lost my job. - (stammering) You did? What happened? - They said they couldn't keep me anymore. - Aw, man, I'm really sorry that happened. Baby, are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah. - Don't worry. We're gonna get through this together, okay? I'm here for you. - And cut! Oh my god, man, that was fuckin' amazing. I, you're breaking my heart over here. Un-fucking-believable. I'm not even just saying that 'cause you're my friend. - You know, thanks, man. I really felt the hopelessness of her situation. (Donte chuckles) - You see, John, how it's supposed to be done. Now, let's get back on over there on the couch and do it one more time. Come on. Sit down, come on. That's it. No, no, no. We're gonna go right from the top, okay? And... Action. - Hey, John. I have some news, some bad news. - (stammering) Well, what is it? - I lost my job. - You did? (stammering) What happened? (Stacy shrieks) - Holy shit. (knife squishing) - [Mark] Come on. (Stacy gasping) - [Donte] Oh my goodness. - No! Why? He's dead! - You believe that? He's a fuckin' shit actor. And this bitch tried to-- (Stacy screaming) And he fuckin' picked scripts? - He's fuckin' dead. You fuckin' killed him. - Yeah, so fuckin' what? It makes no fuckin' difference. - John, you fucks. - John was our fucking friend. - Oh god! - What? What the fuck's the problem? What's your deal? - John! - Shut the fuck up! - This wasn't the fucking plan! I can't believe this shit! - Just kill me. - Where the fuck you goin'? - Just fucking kill me. - Stop filming! (breathing heavily) This is bad. This is really fucking bad. What the fuck was that? Did you know he was gonna do that? - [Donte] What? No, I had no idea he was gonna... - Donte, stop filming. - [Donte] What do you want me to do-- - I want you to get that fucking camera outta my face! - Why are you yelling at him like that? - Get the fuck-- - You just stormed off. - Get the fuck outta here. - Get the fuck outta here? Me? - Get the fuck outta here. - What the fuck are you talk-- - He wants me to stop filming. Should I stop filming? - No, you shouldn't fuckin' stop filming. It's just fuckin' getting good. Keep fuckin' rollin'. What's wrong with you, huh? - What's wrong with me? - Yeah, what the fuck's wrong with you? You're actin' like a fuckin' nut. - You fuckin' killed somebody! - So what? Fuckin' John? You're fuckin' upset 'cause I fucking killed John? That fucking cocksucker? You're fuckin' mad? That's why you're fucking yelling like a fuckin' idiot? - This wasn't the plan. We were just gonna scare them a little bit and record it as a fucking joke. - Yeah, that was the original plan, and we did fuckin' scare them, but, uh, things have fuckin' changed. And now, fuckin' John ain't gonna fuck nobody over no more. - And now, we got a fuckin' dead body out there. - Listen, what'd you think was gonna happen? You think he was just gonna let us go after all that? You don't think he was gonna tell the cops, the fuckin' real cops? - I don't know, man, I don't know, but this wasn't the plan. - You don't know? - I gotta go. - You gotta what? - I can't be a part of this anymore. I gotta go. - Where the fuck are... What are you doing? Get the fuck down. Fuckin' tryin' to leave. What the fuck are you talkin' about? Do you see what the fuck he's doing, Donte? He's trying to fuckin' leave. You believe that shit? This is our fuckin' first movie. Do you remember? Do you fucking get what this means for us? - This isn't even art anymore. I don't know what this is. - You don't know what this is? You're fuckin' talking crazy, man. Do you understand what's going on here? Do you under-fucking-stand what's happening? You're talking like a fuckin' idiot. And (stammering) I can't fuckin' explain it to you! What the fuck about we're makin' a fuckin' movie don't you fucking get? Huh? I don't fuckin' understand. Yes, we have a fucking dead body. Yes, that's right. You keep fuckin' reminding me. Who the fuck did it? Who the fuck stabbed him? It was fuckin' me! - You did that, yeah. - And guess what? We have a little bit of a mess to clean up. - Oh yeah, that's your fuckin' mess that you're gonna clean up by yourself. - I ain't gonna fuckin' do that. (scoffs) Don't fuckin' lay this all on me. What the fuck? Piss on fuckin' John. You're over here fuckin' givin' me the fuckin' Riot Act for fuckin' scourge of the fuckin' Earth of some fuckin' worthless motherfucker! Can't even fuckin' say it 'cause he's a fuckin' piece of fuckin' shit! Jesus fuckin' Christ! Fuckin' screaming like a fuckin' asshole. Making me look like a fuckin' dick in front of the god damn camera. Can't fuckin' talk! Oh my god, all right. Let's just hold on a second. (exhales) Let's just all take a fuckin' deep breath, all right? It got outta hand there, I admit, okay? Yes, we have a mess. And you're right. I took care of it. Maybe I got a little outta hand. I'm not entirely sure how. And we are gonna clean it up, but I need your help, okay? I can't do it without you. We gotta fuckin' finish this thing. So let's go fuckin' take care of this fuckin' body. And let's go fuckin' finish it, okay? Let's fuckin' go! Let's go! Let's just fuckin' take care of it! Let's see if she's still in there. (Stacy whimpering) I don't think we have to worry about her. There we go, we got him down there. - Where do you want him, in the trunk? - No. Let's just put him in the backseat. Fuck it. Here, let me go in for you. - [Ryan] You good? - [Mark] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just keep pushing. Hold on, hold on. - Grab him by his neck. (grunting) - All right, you're gonna have to tug his legs. All right. Hey, guys, come over here and take a look at this. Hey, get a shot of this. - [Donte] What is that, coke? - Yeah, it is, it's fuckin' coke. - [Ryan] Put that shit away, put that shit away. - What? You want some? - No, I don't fuckin' want some. What's your deal today? - Come on, he ain't gonna be needin' it. - [Ryan] Come on, man. - [Donte] He's got a point though, man. - [Ryan] Donte, don't encourage this. (Mark sniffs) - [Donte] Oh my goodness. (Mark coughing) Mark is fuckin' insane. - [Mark] Oh my god. - You all right? - Holy shit. Oh, that's fuckin', has a kick to it. Oh my god, that fuckin' burns. Here, you wanna try some? - Nah, he doesn't. - Oh, nah. - Donte. - Come on. Have you ever done coke before? - [Donte] Coke, I don't know 'bout coke. - Donte, you don't gotta do this, okay? - Come on, give him the camera and do a fuckin' line. - Nah, he doesn't want. Donte, don't fuckin' do this shit, man. You don't have to. - Don't be a fuckin' pussy. Fuckin' come over here and do a line. - Donte, no. - [Donte] Hold the camera. - Donte, what the fuck? - Just hold it real quick. - [Mark] Somebody's gotta do one with me. - All right. - Take it. Just fuckin' do it. - [Donte] Aw, Jesus. - It fuckin' burns, right? (Donte yelps) - [Donte] My nostrils are... Oh my goodness, it's on fire. - Aw, you sure you don't want any, Ryan? - [Ryan] No, I don't fuckin' want some, man. - Oh my gosh. - Hey, John, what's going on? - [Donte] Who the hell is this? - [Mark] Who the fuck are you? - [Donte] Oh shit, man. (breathing heavily) - [Mark] Don't fuckin' move. Don't fuckin' move. - What is this, is this real? - Yeah, this is real. I don't know who the fuck this guy is. Must be his fuckin' neighbor or something. Where's the fuckin' shovel at? It's outside? - [Ryan] Yeah. - [Donte] Shit, man, this isn't right. - [Ryan] What are you gonna do? - Don't worry, I got this. (shovel clangs) - Oh, fuck. Fuck. - What's wrong with you? - You fuckin' see that? You fuckin' see that? This dude came outta fuckin' nowhere. Now look at him. Fuckin' look at that. (Donte retching) Where the fuckin you goin'? What the fuck is up with you guys, huh? What the fuck's the matter with you? Man, are you good? - I'm all right, I'm good. - [Mark] He fuckin' puked all over the fuckin' place. He fuckin' got it on the fuckin' camera. - I can't be a part of this anymore. This isn't what I signed up for. - [Mark] What? What about defending our art? - What are you talkin' about? - [Mark] What about our movie? - Have you fuckin' lost it? - [Mark] Lost it? What is art? Remember? What do we always say? What is art? Say it! Fuckin' repeat it, huh? What is art? Say it! - Anything can be art. The way a tree looks. The beauty of the clouds in the sky. Peoples' expression. Happiness, sadness, pain, death. All of these are art. - [Mark] Yeah, and what are we? - Artists. - [Mark] And what are those that stand against our art? - Evil. - [Mark] That's fuckin' right. Evil! They're fuckin' evil! Come on, man, I need you to take over. - [Donte] All right. - Take the camera. - All right, all right. - All right, where the fuck is the gun? There it is. - [Donte] It smells. - All right, it's still fuckin' good to go. What the fuck are you doing? Leave the fuckin' shovel. Here, take this. - Why? - [Mark] You're gonna do the girl. - Uh, no, I'm not. - [Mark] I've killed two people for cinema. This makes us even, come on. - Well, I'm not killing her. What about Donte? - [Donte] Oh, fuck you, man, all right? I'm camera operator. I'm not killing anybody today. - Well, I've never fuckin' killed anybody before. - Listen, I don't give a fuck who does it, but one of you's gotta do it, okay? So you better fuckin' decide. Let's go! - [Donte] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. That's you. - Look, let's just do a two-out-of-three, okay? - [Mark] Come on, let's fuckin' go, guys. We gotta go. - All right, all right. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Rock, paper, scissors shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Let's go! - Fuck, man. - [Donte] Go get her, man. - Don't fuckin' worry about it, okay? Think of it like an acting role. We're the good guys, remember? - Look, whatever, man. - [Mark] Gimme the fuckin' gun. Gimme it for a second. It's unloaded. Give me the fuckin' bullet. Do you got a fuckin' bullet on you? Let's fuckin' go. - Here, here. - Let's fucking go. - Don't worry, man. It's gonna be all right. - Yeah, that's easy for you to say. I've never done this before. - All right, we're good to go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you goin'? Here you go, take it. Not that way. You're not fuckin' left-handed. All right, it has a fuckin' kick to it, okay? All you gotta do is pull that fuckin' trigger, and she's fuckin' done. That's all you gotta do. It's easy, pull and fucking shoot, okay? So you're gonna fuckin' do this, man. I know you can fuckin' do it. Let's fuckin' go! Let's fuckin' do it! All right, let's fuckin' go. You ready, you fuckin' ready? - [Ryan] I guess. - [Mark] Wait, where the fuck is she? - [Donte] Shit! - What the fuck is this? She got out? What the fuck? - All the windows are closed. - What the... - She couldn't've gotten out. - What the fuck? Oh, mine is too. - How is that even possible? - What the fuck, is she in here? (breathing heavily) What the fuck is this shit? What the fuck is this shit, man? What the fuck? Do you think she's up there, man? - I don't know, maybe? - Where the fuck else would she be? - [Donte] I don't know. - She's in this fuckin' attic, man? I don't know what the fuck! What the fuck? How did she even fuckin' get out? Come on, man, get the fuck up there. Let's go. - I don't wanna go up there. - Come on, you're already fuckin' in there. Just walk up the steps. You fuckin' drew the fucking short straw. Let's fucking go. You got the gun, come on. We ain't got fuckin' time. What if she's fuckin' out already? What if she's outta the fuckin' house? - All right, all right, all right, fuck. - Be fucking careful. What the fuck, man? What the fuck, man? Do you fuckin' see? We're fucking going up fuckin' attics and shit now? How the fuck did she even get out? Tell me how the fuck she got out. This fuckin', the cheapest fuckin' duct tape, huh, you ever fuckin' saw. - [Donte] Well, she has to be up there, man. - We fuckin' tied her good, didn't we? - [Donte] There's no other place she could be. She has to be up there. - She gotta fuckin' be up there. - He'll find her. - I don't know where the fuck else she could go. - [Donte] He'll find her, he'll kill her, and that's that. - What the fuck's takin' so long? I haven't heard a fuckin' shot. Have you heard a fuckin' shot? - [Donte] Ryan! - [Mark] What's goin' on up there, huh? Huh? Here he is. What the fuck? - [Donte] What happened, man? - [Mark] What? - She's not up there. - She's not what? - What? - [Mark] She's not up there? - She ain't up there. - Where the fuck is she then? - I don't know, but she's not up there. - You looked all around? - Every inch of that place. She's not up there, she's gone. Look, she could've called the cops. We gotta get the fuck outta here. Come on. - She's... - She's not there. She's not up there, I don't know. - You're fucking sure? - I'm positive, she's not up there. She wasn't there, man, let's just go. - Ryan. - Come on, we need to go. Let's go. - [Mark] Ryan. - Donte, you know, you get it, that we gotta go, right? - Ryan, be fuckin' honest. Was she up there? - [Ryan] Look. - She was fuckin' up there, wasn't she? She was up there and you wouldn't fuckin' kill her. Is that fuckin' right? - Look-- - Is that right? Get the fuck outta my way! - Wait, wait, stop, stop. - I knew she was fuckin' up. - Wait, wait, stop, stop. - What the fuck are you doin'? - Mark, stop, relax. All right, let's just go. Let's just get out of here. - [Mark] Give me that fucking gun! Give me that fucking gun! - Don't you see? - [Mark] What the fuck, you gonna kill me now? - Listen, Mark, don't you see what's happening here? We've corrupted ourselves. This isn't art. - We gotta fucking kill her. - Drugs. Drugs, violence. We're just like them now. We've corrupted art, and we've corrupted ourselves. We're full of shit! - [Mark] Watch where you're fuckin' pointing that shit. Gimme that fucking gun! I'm gonna fuckin' end this whether you want to or not! Gimme the fucking gun! Gimme the fucking gun! (Stacy breathing heavily) Where the... Where the fuck did she-- (gunshot booms) - No! - [Mark] The fucking bitch shot fucking Donte. Where the fuck you goin'? (Stacy screams) God damn, my fuckin' arm. The bitch fuckin' went downstairs. Come on. - [Ryan] Okay. - [Mark] Fuckin' bitch. Stacy! Stacy, we're coming! Come on, where you fuckin' at, bitch? Where you at, Stacy? Go check over there. (sighs) That fuckin' bitch. Come on, Stacy, you hiding? Come on, we're not gonna fuckin' hurt you. We're not gonna fuckin' hurt you. This fuckin' bitch. This fuckin' bitch is gonna fuckin' die. Where you at, bitch? Where the fuck you at, bitch? Huh? Did you see anything? You got anything yet? - No. - You dumb fuck. Dumb fuck, where you at, bitch? Where the fuck are you? Gosh, fuckin' bitch. Oh, this fuckin' bitch, where you at? Where you at, bitch? Where you fuckin' at, you fucking bitch? Where you at? (metal clanging) What the fuck? What the fuck did you do? What the fuck did you do? (Stacy screaming) What did you do? Hello? What did you do? (Stacy whimpering) You stupid fuckin' bitch. (knife squishing) You stupid fuckin' bitch. Stupid fucking bitch. Why the fuck did you do that, huh? Why the fuck did you do that? I can't get you fuckin' help, man. I can't fucking get you any fuckin' help. (breathing heavily) Jesus fucking Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. (whimpering) Let me just... (exhales sharply) Let me see. (gun clicks) Aw, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh. Oh, fuck. Aw, fuck. Oh, we can fuckin' do it, come on. You can fuckin' do it, come on. Oh, Jesus. Okay. I'm sorry, man. (gunshot booms) Come on, come on, Donte. Ah, where you goin'? Donte, I'm sorry. Donte. Look so nice. Look so nice. Aw. Look at this bitch. She got what she deserved, didn't she, Donte? Look at that bitch, the fuckin' knife stickin' out of her. Hi. As you can see, the car's pretty full after what happened yesterday. Five people are dead. I blame myself, but I don't feel guilty. I say this in spite of knowing that Ryan really didn't understand what I was tryin' to do was show. You see, when you love something as much as I do, film and art in particular, you gotta shield it. You gotta protect it. You gotta fight for it. You gotta love it. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let anybody like fuckin' John get in the way of my fuckin' art. Do you understand? Maybe you don't. I found a nice little area here on the side of the road. Woods all around here. I got the shovel in the trunk. My guess is I'll be here all fuckin' night. As far as the film, it's at its end. I hope this has been an entertaining debut from us to you. It's not the kinda film I wanted to make, but it's what you people wanted. So I had to give it to you, and honestly, if I have to, I'll make another one of these films again, 'cause I honestly think you people fuckin' need somebody like me. (Mark gasping for air) (Stacy breathing heavily) (blood splatters) (coughing) (Mark retching) (dark electronic music)
