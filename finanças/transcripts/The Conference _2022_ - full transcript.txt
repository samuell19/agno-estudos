Reinhard Heydrich Dr. Stuckart Heinrich Mueller Adolf Eichmann (Man on the radio) "...have the so-called heads of state spoken to by the enemy powers. They could afford the silence for while you were silent, your guns spoke." * Cheers on the radio * "And have your soldiers won victories, their gigantic proportions didn't know the story before. It is a proud pleasure for us Berliners You, my Führer, in the name of the entire German people to express our fervent gratitude . I think I'm speaking on behalf of all this people when I say my Führer, we have been with you while you were silent, in hard times and in happy times. And we will stay with you over all calamities until the proud hour of our victory." * Cheers on the radio * (Speaker) Berlin, in the war winter of 1942. The persecution and murder of the Jewish population of Europe has long started. On January 20, top representatives from the SS meet NSDAP and ministerial bureaucracy to a conference in a villa on the Großer Wannsee. Reinhard Heydrich invited to the meeting with breakfast, Chief of the Reich Security Main Office. On the agenda, literally: the final solution of the Jewish question. * engine hum * Hail Hitler. Good Morning. Obergruppenfuhrer Heydrich already landed? Not yet. Let me know. Yes indeed. who is already there dr Freisler, State Secretary Neumann. Herr Luther from the Foreign Office. In the drawing room. They can't wait. Where can I find Obersturmbannfuhrer Eichmann? In the briefing room, squad leader. Do me a favor and go ahead. Entertain the gentlemen with some conversation. Tell a few stories from the East. The gentlemen state secretaries could do that find unsavory. You can do it. Comrade Eichman. Good morning, squad leader. It looks very fashionable. We're almost done. Heydrich there at the head end? You on the right, Gruppenfuhrer Hofmann on his left. Hofmann will like that. And here? Besides? East Ministry. Gauleiter Meyer, Doctor Leibbrandt and General Government Doctor Buehler. Let's put Meyer a little further away. I thought as Gauleiter... Then he just feels important. Continue? dr Schoengarth and Dr. Longing. Gut. And across the street from the Ink Knights. Yes indeed. And you, what about you? I sit down with Fraulein Werlemann. This allows us to clarify protocol issues directly. At the cat table, I understand. Thank you for your visit. I think so too, group leader. Is something different. If you ask me we can hold all meetings here. You don't like it in Mr. Eichmann's office? I did not say that. Do something for the working atmosphere, Eichmann. Excursion to the zoo. I'll be happy to explore the possibilities. Did your trip to Theresienstadt go well? Very well. came back yesterday Found as expected? It's tight, but not in the way they'd have us believe. what did i tell you The new bunk beds are extremely functional. The gentlemen just have to move together. First the fall of Mölders, now Field Marshal Reichenau. I just took the black dress coat to the cleaners, we have to go to the next state funeral. Terrible loss, and now of all times. - Yes. I heard it was a stroke. In the depths of the Ukrainian forests. What was he doing in the forest? forest run. At minus 40 degrees, like every morning, around the quarters. You are joking. A few degrees below zero won't stop Reichenau. Hard dog. - Minus 40 degrees, my God. When I think of our men in front of Moscow... The Russians don't have it any warmer either. Moscow will fall by Easter at the latest . isn't it, dr. Schoengarth? Of course. Excuse me. (Freisler) We also had a lot of night frost today. - (Luther) Yes. (Neuman) Yes. Did your chauffeur also have to scratch? That's a surprise. Dr. Schöngarth. I thought you were in Latvia. - Yes. I am too. I come on behalf of Dr. steel corner You make a career. - Hm, well. I'm not a big fan of meetings. - Hmm. Get used to it. Where are you staying? Here. My room is up there on the right . Would you have said something? The dog is buried here. Oh. I only arrived at night, so... Do you have a lot to do? Mhm. You've hardly finished with your own Jews when the next ones come. 900 figures again yesterday , Czechs. Where do you put them all? Riga? ghetto? Well, that's still to come. A little walk in the woods and that was it. Mr Kritzinger. - Doctor Klopfer. I thought I wouldn't arrive at all. Be careful what you say. The Gestapo is keeping a close eye on us. As far as I know there is nothing against you, Dr. Knocker. Oh. I am relieved. Ministerial Director Kritzinger. squad leader. I didn't even know your office was out here maintains a branch office. Former manufacturer's villa. Aryanized? In this case not. Gentlemen. Obergruppenfuhrer Heydrich has just landed. * Beat * We start point 12. Let the kitchen know. Yes, Obersturmbannfuhrer. We reckon with 90 minutes. Once the doors are closed, prepare the snack. * Soft babble of voices * Gauleiter. squad leader. dr Buehler. dr Leibbrandt. squad leader. Where have you kidnapped us, Müller? Looks really feudal. It is the guest house of the Reich Security Main Office. Ah. The East Ministry should also have a guest house at Wannsee. (Leibbrandt) I see it that way too. Are you accommodated so elegantly in Kraków, Dr. Buehler? The Government General has other concerns. Two million Polish Jews. - Who are you telling? Help has been promised for months. Nothing happens. That's why we're here. Governor General Frank expects results. Gentlemen. * engine hum * Group leader Mueller. dr stucco type. Congratulations on the offspring? Well informed as always. What gives us the honor of the place? Do you have the painters on Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse? We wanted to add a little variety. They want to impress us. But don't get your hopes up. The house has central heating. For God's sake. - Could you give me a brief orientation? Gauleiter Meyer. You really should know. East Ministry. (Lange) He hasn't introduced himself yet. - That's coming. Considers himself important. For the real thing he has Leibbrandt. He speaks seven languages. - (admiringly) Hm. The one next to it? - dr Buehler. I'm allowed to deal with him all the time in Kraków. General Government, Civil Administration. And the other suits? - Troublemaker on duty. Secretaries of State and stuff like that. Goering's four-year plan authority. Ministry of Justice, Reich Chancellery, Party Chancellery. Luther, he's all right, State Department. I hope I don't have to remember them all. But you have to remember that. stucco type. He'll be Minister of the Interior. - Well, that'll be fun. It's like fellowship night. In the end, it's always about who's in charge. Only without beer. Too bad actually. - Mmm. (knock) I thought you were coming by bike. I had thought about it. Oh, you live here by the lake? Two kilometers. Beautiful house. wonderful family. The young man, who is this? Sturmbannfuhrer, if I see correctly. In this round? If he gets along well with Schöngarth, he belongs to the coarse ranks. Heydrich's struggling administration. I don't even want to know what our men in the East are experiencing. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Group leader Hofmann. It is my joy. For my part, Gauleiter. What is the east doing? Too many Jews, but we're working on it. - That's why we're here today. If the invitation is to be believed, Herr Heydrich develop an overall plan for solving the Jewish question. Do you know more? He seems serious. Otherwise he would hardly have asked us out of here. Reich Marshal Goering entrusted him with the task. His official route to the Reich Marshal is surprisingly short. The Obergruppenfuhrer is an ambitious man. You can say that out loud. Legendary climb. He's not even an academic. He's successful. And that counts. The success is granted to him. I just don't like it if someone is poaching in my jurisdiction. May I introduce? Sturmbannfuhrer Lange. Are you here on behalf of? - Stahlecker Brigade. You are known. Warm welcome. Hail Hitler. Welcome to Berlin. Mueller, Eichmann. How are you? Good thank you. Did you have a nice flight? Yes. Gentlemen already arrived? we are complete Good. Excellent idea to invite the gentlemen to the second breakfast. So they show up on time. mood picture? dr Stuckart expresses himself combatively. dr Bühler complains about the Jews. Then everything is as usual. Watch that one you well taken care of in the kitchen, Hauptsturmfuhrer. Do you have the numbers I asked for? Be ready. Whereby I allow myself to remark accuracy varies on some items. The impression of accuracy is sufficient. Gauleiter. Obergruppenfuhrer. Good morning, Gentlemen. Sorry for the delay. The start in Prague has been delayed a bit. We have big plans. I'll be with you in a minute. Mr Luther. dr Longing. you excuse me? Please close the door. I hear the Federal Foreign Office is developing its own ideas. To deal with the Jewish question? Correctly. I hope these ideas match what has been discussed. I would hate to start over. Everything as discussed, Obergruppenfuhrer. In general , it all boils down to that we must have full access to all Jews of all nationalities, as long as they are within our sphere of influence. The time for international consideration is over. As a matter of fact. America has decided against us , and so has England. The Jews have lost their value as hostages. They should have been taken from us while it was still possible. That coincides with our ideas. I like the last section best : "Implementation of these measures in good agreement with the Secret State Police Office." If I may say so, the cooperation with Mr. Eichmann turns out to be extremely constructive. Maybe it's because I was also in the transport business. I can guess what work the current actions are preparing. That's nice to hear. Our approach to the Jewish question is similar to that of many of your counterparts too bold for the tender sentiments of abroad. I have nothing against nails with heads. If you would give us a moment ? Naturally. clerk? Miss Werlemann, Eichmann office. Reliable? 100 percent. orderlies? Handpicked people. dr Long, come closer. No need to hide. I only hear good things from the Baltic States. The commander of Einsatzgruppe A, Brigadefuehrer Stahlecker, and the Higher SS and Police Leader Ostland, Obergruppenfuhrer Jeckeln, authorize me to report to you: Estonia judenfrei. Lithuania and Latvia, except for the remains of working Jews, also free of Jews. What am I saying? Good news. if you allow Aha. What is that? We took the liberty of making a sketch. With the quotas achieved so far. Einsatzgruppe A is currently at 220,000. That adds up to half a million with the others. It will. You've put a lot of effort into that. N / A. A friend made the drawings . We have one who can do that. White Ruthenia only 42,000? Unfortunately. As you can see, the space is huge, lacking in vehicles and gas. The ground is frozen. We can't dig pits. Shooting is still possible, but disposal is halting. How do you manage? Stack. Until it thaws again. We will be able to eliminate such bottlenecks in a timely manner. The promised gas trucks will soon be on their way to you. Hm. Have the problems with loading been solved in the meantime? Problems? A friend from Kulmhof told me that. Because the Jews don't get into trucks voluntarily. There's probably always unrest in the hold. Yes, a little finesse is certainly required. And then you have to get out again. The comrade says it's a bigger mess than shooting. We still see an efficiency advantage. If you occupy the space with ten units per square meter. The special vehicles are only an interim solution. You will learn more about the current scope of the plans later. I am excited. Eichmann. The incoming transport from Theresienstadt? Done last night. I almost missed my flight. Thank you, Sturmbannfuhrer. Order is order. We know that you and your comrades for the people and the fatherland do a necessary duty of which few are able. The future will be heroism appreciate your men. I'll pass this on to my men , if you'll allow me . Do that. Some gentlemen you'll meet just outside are not made of the same stuff as us. We inherited some leftovers from the previous government. Herr Müller and his family like to talk about Santa Clauses. dr Schöngarth warned me. I practice restraint. Not necessary. The gentlemen should know what they are participating in. That closes the ranks. I understand. A matter of dosage. That's the way it is. A question of dosage. Here please. Right in front. Shouldn't my place be here? Here, Gauleiter. - Would you be so nice? Please. So here we are again , talking about the Jews. Looks like it. A terribly unpleasant subject. Good thank you. Dr. Stuckart. Undersecretary of State Luther. The private audience with the Obergruppenfuhrer was successful? No reason to be jealous. As I heard, you have already been invited to Prague. To represent the interests of the Ministry of Interior. Not those of the Reich Security Main Office. Water? With pleasure. * Door is closed. * Herr Gauleiter, gentlemen State Secretaries, comrades of the SS. I'm glad you're inviting me could follow to the Wannsee. We kidnap you from the dusty offices, hoping we won't be disturbed here from the phones and the back and forth of speakers. Besides, your offices and departments should use the amenities want to enjoy our guest house , the night here costs... Eichmann, will you help me? Five Reichsmarks per night and person. Well, that's an offer. So that's why we're here. The Reich Security Main Office opens up new sources of money. Small livestock makes a mess too, Herr Gauleiter. kidding aside. For the reason of our meeting I ask you, Your attention to my invitation enclosed letter from Reich Marshal Goering. In it the Reich Marshal gives me the order, I quote, "all the necessary preparations in organizational, factual, material terms to be taken for an overall solution to the Jewish question in Europe". He tells me further all central instances affected by these plans to participate in the production of this overall design. That, gentlemen, would be you. And that's why we're here today. Please include a copy for the record. Roger that. Is a question allowed? Already now, dr. Freisler? Yes. It's a small thing. According to the date, your appointment dates back to July last year. May I know why it is used now? I've been allowed to split up for a few months between Berlin and Prague. My duties as Deputy Reich Protector claimed me. The Czech resistance proves to be recalcitrant. But that was to be expected. They are stubborn, the Slavs. An attempt to meet in December then failed because of military developments: the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, the Führer's declaration of war on the Americans, most recently the Russian counter-offensive in the east. Apparently the Russians decided to show some resistance. That won't help him. Finally, I am commissioned to submit an overall draft in view of the, I quote again the Reich Marshal, "Implementation of the intended final solution to the Jewish question". The overall solution to the Jewish question is precisely this: the final solution of the Jewish question. Correspondingly extensive and complicated our preparations presented themselves . This is also why there was a certain amount of time ahead. Thank you for the information. I totally understand. Have I understood that correctly? We are no longer talking only about the Reich Jews? The new plans actually affect all of Europe? That's the way it is. The Jewish question can only be regarded as solved after complete biological eradication of all Judaism to the Urals. That's the target. The task that fate has set for us. * clear your throat * (Neumann) All of Europe, that's... Whole europe. Those are completely new perspectives. The goal has been there for a long time. What's new is that we're going to start now. This is not unexpected. I met the Führer in his apartment in the Old Reich Chancellery. He said in no uncertain terms that he wanted to come clean. (Leibbrandt) As he prophesied in the Reichstag: If Judaism succeeds to plunge the peoples into another world war, the result will not be the bolshevization of this world, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe. We are now witnessing the fulfillment of the prophecy . The Jews wanted war, they get it. A destiny is thus fulfilled in Judaism it's hard but deserved. So pity or regret are totally inappropriate. We can probably do without a round of introductions , most of them are well known here. Except for Mr. Sturmbannfuhrer. dr stucco type? Forgiveness. I just wanted to point out that Herr Sturmbannfuhrer at least not known to me . dr Long, would you be so kind? Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Rudolph Long, Commander of the security police and the SD in the General District of Latvia. I represent Dr. Stahlecker, who sends his best regards to you all. So that would be the end of it. Latvia? Isn't that our ride? - (Long) Correct. Our operational area is in the Reichskommissariat Ostland. And yet we have never met? It hasn't come up yet. - Then it's about time. We'd like to know who's in charge. I'll set it up. (Leibbrandt) Gentlemen are interested thanks to the joint efforts of our Eastern Ministry and the comrades from the task force Estonia is now considered Jew-free. dr Lange has already informed me . You will receive the status quo in terms of task forces as usual in the form of the current report. You 're welcome to take a look later. If I may ask a question about this? A quick question, Herr Ministerialdirektor? It directly affects Dr. Long jurisdiction. Please. As you write in your invitation, find in the past few months already increased number of transports of Jews from the Reich and the Protectorate, based on your Referat IV B4 and your Jewish advisor, Obersturmbannfuhrer Eichmann. That is correct. With these transports it seems to have come to certain irregularities . The Reich Chancellery has a case from November ago, from the Riga area. Could you get to the point, Mr. Kritzinger? So. In the efforts in the Riga ghetto for, how shall I put it, to provide some relief is a transport with Berlin Jews that arrived at the same time also included in the special treatments . Famous. And further? This incident is in the Ministry of Interior also been discussed. With a certain lack of understanding. I ask you. Jewry forced this war on us . If we hit back hard, you have to understand the world-historical necessity of this hardness and must not anxiously ask whether this or that particular Jew personally to blame. Look, gentlemen... You and I sitting here nice and warm. Locally, in the East, things are often less orderly. It is not always possible to make every individual decision to obtain an up-to-date order situation from Berlin. I am aware of that. I was a soldier in World War I. Then you also know that our units are in areas close to the front are forced to make certain improvisations . We're talking over 1000 people here. From Berlin. (Long) What should we have done? We can't put them in the snow and wait for them to freeze. I have faith in the judgment of our men. In the end you solve things in the spirit of the leader. Let's not kid ourselves. What was forbidden in November is allowed in December. The death of a Ukrainian or Latvian Jew do n't want to make waves here. But every single one of these 1000 Reich Jews has relatives, acquaintances and friends in Berlin. This leads to confusion and questions. And it's not always the Reich Chancellery then it is still possible to give correct information. It's the same with us at the Justice Department. In addition, there are rumors of suicides on the part of German Jews. And that leads in the population considerable concern. So I'm not worried about Jewish suicides. (Freisler) There were even isolated cases non-Jews deported, or Jews who fought on the German side in the World War, partly highly decorated. Sometimes the Gestapo appears not complying with their own guidelines . These are unfortunate start-up glitches. That's why we're here today, so that all your concerns are heard. Reich Marshal Goering, for whom I speak here today, recently complained that Jewish skilled workers were transported away from factories important for armaments . That can be right now, in the critical phase of the war, in no way be in our interest. I understand that the Reich Marshal criticizes a function what he welcomes in another. Since we are already talking about current transports... Can we do this in the back? Governor General Frank was promised months ago by the Führer that the General Government will soon be liberated from Jews. We are waiting. The ghettos are bursting at the seams. show me one better off We also run the risk of that the Jews cannot be fed. Wouldn't it be the most humane solution the Jews, if they are not able to work, be done with a quick-acting agent ? That would be nicer than letting them starve. Economically absolutely right. It's war. Why should we waste valuable resources on Jews? It's not that we're unable to solve the problem yourself. We, too, undertook, through Mr. Wetzel, the Jewish consultant, already advances to Mr. Brack from the euthanasia actions. There are some methods , albeit not entirely harmless. That's why I'd prefer it if you let that be our concern. We are already working with Mr. Brack. His people provide us with knowledge and equipment. In the Litzmannstadt ghetto, this is already providing noticeable relief. We hope to learn more about these measures today. At least that's what we were promised. Gentlemen, I realize we live in turbulent times. We have for the past few months tremendous developments initiated in large numbers. Sometimes the success of the measures overtakes them our own plans. Not least because of too much overlap in matters of jurisdiction. Welcome to Berlin, where everyone is responsible for everything. German thoroughness. We should consider it a virtue. Beautiful, but so that we our virtue doesn't get in the way in the end, we need for what lies ahead, faster decisions, shorter distances. We have to parallelize our lines to a certain extent. I therefore note, also with regard to to the letter just read out from Reich Marshal Göring: Leading the final solution to the Jewish question is immediately available regardless of geographic boundaries centrally with the Reichsfuhrer SS, Heinrich Himmler, and with his authority to the head of the Reich Security Main Office, so my humble humble self. * short cough * Excuse me, can I tell the Home Secretary that the Reich Security Main Office writes the Jewish laws himself? It would be easier. don't worry dr stucco type. You will be appropriately involved in the decisions. Appropriately involved or faced with a fait accompli? Don't you want to see Obergruppenfuhrer's plans first? listen before you feel left out? With respect, what I'm feeling is beside the point. I ask out of responsibility for the areas of competence of my ministry. And I'm amazed that I'm the only one. What about you, Mr. Luther? Or the gentlemen from the East Ministry? what about us You've been complaining for months that Berlin talked into your Jewish question, and now you're silent? You , in particular, are talking right now about our Jewish question. dr Buehler? Do you see it the same way in Kraków? If final solution of the Jewish question means that our Jews will finally be taken from us, I am ready to follow the leadership of the Obergruppenfuhrer. And that's exactly what will happen. We will solve your Jewish problems for you. You'll all agree with me at the end of the day that exclusively the Reich Security Main Office is able to organize the Jewish question and above all practical . We have the necessary means, the methods, the organization, the experiences and above all the people with the necessary determination. If at the end of today you have a different opinion, I'm happy to pass on the task. It's not that we do n't have enough work already. So if you allow me to continue? Of course. Allow me to briefly review. We've been fighting Judaism since '33 and push the Jews mercilessly back from the spheres of life of the German people. The Jewish race became recognized as a race alien to the German body politic, thanks in part to the measures and methods of the Race and Settlement Main Office. Thanks to comprehensive Jewish laws is to the Jews every harmful influence on our national community has become impossible. See the Jewish legislation, among others by Dr. stucco, the author of the Nuremberg Laws. co-author. too much of an honor Finally, with the aim of to cleanse the German living space of Jews in a legal way, caused a large number of Jews to emigrate. Lieutenant Colonel? As of today, there are around 537,000. Not least thanks to the organizational efforts by Obersturmbannfuhrer Eichmann personally. My department is also only part of the Gestapo office. Under Group Leader Müller. gift. Fundamental was the accelerated emigration of the Jews not a bad idea. Let them exert their harmful influence elsewhere. But emigration is no longer an option. Nobody wants them abroad. We tried it. And we must not give forces to the enemy in time of war. What became of the idea, the clan to ship to Madagascar? Then the world would be at peace. (Luther) Off the table as England has sovereignty at sea. We're not getting there. The same applies to the Siberian swamps. At least as long as the Russians stand in our way. For all these reasons , the Reichsfuhrer SS and Chief of the German Police Heinrich Himmler further emigration of Jews was forbidden in October. Here we turn our attention to what I would like to call the possibilities of the East. There we now have not least thanks to the work of our task forces, around half a million Jews were given special treatment and thereby gained the experience us with regard to the coming final solution of the Jewish question are of important importance. And so, meanwhile, instead of emigration as another possible solution , let's call it evacuation of the Jews to the East, in order to lead them there to the final solution using the methods of the East. Pardon me, Obergruppenfuhrer? dr Longing? Are we getting more Jews sent? no They continue to deal with the Eastern Jews, which accrue as the front advances . The major measures planned by the Reich are under way about the Higher SS and Police Leaders. And how big are the big measures? Large enough that in the end even the task forces to the final solution rooms. Yes, when we speak of the evacuation to the final solution rooms, is it meant the special treatment of all European Jews? You should listen to it quietly, but also forget it again: It is exactly like that. sorry if the question is allowed but where are the final solution rooms? Not with us, that was never mentioned. With us. In the General Government. At least I assume so. Construction work is underway in the Lublin area , under Brigade Commander Globocnik. We will be part of the accruing Jews work away in the General Government. In the Belzec and Sobibor areas and in East Upper Silesia Are capacity expansions planned? near a village called Auschwitz. More on that later. sorry dr Buehler. Don't say, your governor general really want to get rid of the Jews ? Now he gets even more? Why are you so interested in our Jews? They are taking this news with great composure. The Obergruppenfuhrer explained it. We do not have to take care of Jews who come to us as a final solution . They don't come to stay. That's the way it is. There is no need to worry. You will hardly notice anything about our measures . With all due respect, you speak of all the Jews of Europe. A good cue. Lieutenant Colonel? This map shows the current one politico-military state of Europe. Here in the east the current course of the front. In dark red the territory of the Reich on the eve of the war. In light red, the areas incorporated into the Reich : the former western Poland, former Czech Republic, formerly Austria. Farther east, those under German civil administration know standing eastern territories: Ostland, Ukraine, General Government. red, vertically hatched, the areas occupied by us militarily: Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Northern France, Croatia, Greece, North Africa. Finally, horizontally hatched, the countries allied with us or influenced by us: Italy, Vichy France, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Serbia, Slovakia. Europe is practically in our hands. And we've only just started. (knock) Those black dots stand for? Jews, the density of dots seems to indicate the concentration of Jews. So it is, the farther east we look, the more compact the Jewish opponent appears to us. Especially in former Poland and former areas of the Soviet Union. They have also been spreading there for centuries. In the rear of the front, in the fog of war, we have already been able to reduce the concentration. But there is still enough to do. The task seems very ambitious to me. I consider myself a connoisseur of the matter, but I can hardly see How many Jews are we talking about here in total. We're talking eleven million. *quiet cough* From this list you can judge How Judaism is distributed among the individual countries. In the old Reich we still have around 130,000 German Jews. Numerically manageable, politically complicated. We spoke about it. The biggest items: General Government with 2.3 million, USSR, the biggest chunk, around five million. In the Balkans, let me just add up, around 1.6 million, almost a million in all of France. The numbers are higher than expected. They also list unoccupied countries here. England, Switzerland... Of course. These numbers already form the forthcoming one total reorganization of Europe. In perspective, so to speak. Very well. Our gaze must not only reach to the horizon, but also behind. And where do these numbers come from? From our archives. And by Jewish representatives in Vienna and Berlin. The Federal Foreign Office also contributed. Are the numbers reliable? It should be about right. Those are huge numbers. If I could just put that into perspective ? Willingly. Please short. We need to look at these numbers in a larger context. The final solution to the Jewish question is only one building block in the planned reorganization of Europe. In the long term we are talking about distance of all lower-race ethnic groups from our sphere of influence. The mash of peoples found in the eastern regions must give way completely to make room for the Germanization of the won areas of life in the east by German settlement. At the end of the day we are talking about a Europe that we put our stamp on impose on our Germanic culture and in the non-Germanic peoples are only tolerated as slave labor . Reading and writing at elementary school level, arithmetic up to 100. We don't need them for more. This reorganization and revival of Europe requires the repopulation in the three-digit million range. On the other hand, the implementation of a final solution seems to me almost manageable for eleven million Jews . How does one intend to master all these masses of Jews? How exactly is this supposed to work? (Neumann) I ask myself that too. The transports have only just begun it's already faltering and blocking everywhere. How is that supposed to be when eleven million start moving? They don't move. You will be set in motion. By U.S. I don't want to downplay it. We have one here in world history the only organizational task ahead of us. The whole thing will go like this: We plan to systematically comb Europe from West to East. Evacuated Jews are first taken to transit ghettos, from there step by step to be transported further east . Did I understand that correctly, from West to East? That's the way it is. I can hopefully assume that one anticipates the General Government. If we already provide the final solution rooms, our Jews were supposed to be worked away there first. Well, we'll see. With all due respect. It's hardly reasonable to ask that we watch trains full, shall we say, French Jews roll into our territory. While our country is choking under masses of Jews. - You are funny. Do you think it's different with us? Of course we will anticipate the German Reich territory. If only for reasons of the housing shortage as a result of the bombing. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia has priority. Not because it 's my front yard, so to speak. Too many Czechs believe that they will get rid of us again. The Czech resistance the Jewish controlled spine must be broken. This is military necessity. I understand all that, nevertheless: A plan without taking away our Jews at the beginning of the final solution, for the record, Governor General Frank meet with no reciprocal love, that was discussed differently. We were promised the relief of our ghettos, at the beginning of the final solution. Well, we'll see. Should arise in the matter of order fail to reach an agreement will i be so free to request a decision from the Führer . The remaining assets of these eleven million Jews that might be a larger sum. It can be assumed. So far Aryanized assets are flowing to the authorized representative for the four-year plan. May I inform Reich Marshal Goering that this still applies? Wait a minute, on the accruing assets of the Eastern Jews the East Ministry probably has access. That's what I mean. Our Jews, our money. The money is used to finance the transport volume. Unfortunately, even we have to go to the Reichsbahn pay an amount for each Jew . So before we distribute the bear's fur, Should we hunt him down first? Where do we get the necessary transport capacities from? (Neumann) Good question. Our armament tasks are already demanding largely roads and rails. And now eleven million Jews are coming onto the track? And do not forget about the Wehrmacht. The fighting troops also have to be moved, along with the material. There are already certain supply problems, even without transports of Jews. Should the transports hamper the war effort, will the party advocate to answer the Jewish question after the war. Fighting Jews is part of the war effort. It's not a luxury we ourselves contribute alongside military efforts . War and race struggle are one. Where we fight the Jew, we fight for the Reich. That's all well and good, but we mustn't overdo it either. Exactly. First the victory and then the Jews. Gentlemen, as much as I respect your concerns, right now we are not allowed to see the visions of the Führer Pruning down like a houseplant. Only ten years ago the Jews lived everywhere among us, almost invisible, as if they were part of our national community. And look at where we are today. How far we've come. How the space of our possibilities is constantly expanding. Now to think smaller out of false fear... would be a fatal mistake. We must continue to have the courage to take the big leap, to the big vision, right now. We are in a critical phase of the war. Russia to the east, America to the west, at sea by the English. War is not an obstacle. He is an opportunity. Especially in war , spaces open up for us, which are denied to us in peace. Despite all personal tragedies , war also an opportunity to create facts. Intervene radically in a society. To frame with great design. When the farmer wants to till his field, he must first drive the spade into the earth. * clear throat * Perhaps transport and personnel issues best answer if Mr. Eichmann provides information about specific processes. As the Jew Advisor in Office IV B4 , I am in charge the registration and transport of the Jews to be deported. Next: The Jews will be transported in portions, dependent on military development. After the Jew was registered with the police, reported and is divided, he is taken into custody. He hands over the key to the apartment and signs it the declaration of assets in favor of the Reich and goes with a suitcase and a maximum of 50 Reichsmarks to the collection point. Usually to a remote siding. Where he is loaded. Why the asset waiver? Jews lose with citizenship also their assets when crossing the border. The transfer is not voluntary. Bureaucratic procedures have a calming effect. In terms of an orderly process, when Jews board the trains with a sense of order. I understand. The transport takes place after agreement with the Ministry of Transport, the Transport Command of the Order Police and the timetable conference of the Reichsbahn. Here we give for reasons of efficiency and monitoring by the accompanying personnel in preference to transport in goods wagons. However, at the beginning, up to the border of the empire, the passenger train is calculated as a means of deportation. For optical reasons. I assume that we as a target area be informed about numbers? We want to know how many are coming. Of course. The transports take place after prior coordination with the respective recording capacity of the target areas of the East. Be it ghettos, labor camps, transit camps or ultimately direct actions. How high are our personnel expenses? There is no personnel question. For the full enterprise we can get by with a handful of men. Is that so? - Yes, that's how it is. A train with ten wagons can easily guarded by a dozen men . What about the transport bottlenecks, that we just pointed out? We don't expect any bottlenecks. We use freight wagons, which previously Russian civilian workers were brought into the Reich. Otherwise they would roll back empty. So there is an exchange. Russian against Jew, Jew against Russian. So we are optimizing existing processes? That is correct. This is how we prevent empty runs. Nice. - (Luther) Great weather. If I had had a freight forwarder like Eichmann back then, I would have a villa like that here too. So that would also answer these questions. In the log? Yes, Obergruppenfuhrer. (Neumann) Allow me to point this out. If we through these transports in the Reich lose Jewish armament workers and in exchange receive unskilled foreign workers, that wouldn't be a win. That will not happen. Whoever is useful to us should stay, at least for the time being. In general, the criterion of usefulness and workability play a much larger role from now on . If this is not available, our patience is exhausted. This is how it was done in insane asylums and institutions for the handicapped. We can not afford unnecessary eaters. - One moment please. It was just said that the Jews would receive special treatment as part of the final solution . Now they say they should work for us? We have to make a decision then, don't we? Just for planning reasons. Those who are to work must also be fed and housed. Our plans include both. Jews able to work become under appropriate supervision and come to work in a suitable way in the East . In large work columns they will, for example road building, led to these areas. There you will work for us, Breaking stones, draining swamps and the like. I recommend organizing this separately by gender, so as not to increase the Jewish problem . That's exactly how it's planned. All right, give it to me. there is enough work. - (Hofmann) Certainly. The Germanization of our gained territories in the east requires roads, factories, farms, Apartments for German settlers. The Reichsfuhrer SS is also planning massive construction work to secure these areas. So we will have to come to an agreement. But the Jews and this hard physical labor? I know from experience that we shouldn't expect too much here. The majority of Jews work in trade or in the private professions, and not just in road construction. Well, we won't go easy on you, you can be sure of that. And no doubt a majority will due to natural reduction . It is definitely planned that way. And the rest? Who doesn't fail? This accumulated remainder will have to be treated accordingly in the end , since it is undoubtedly the most resistant part. Treated accordingly... That is? Ask the nearest Jew. He knows the answer. I wanted to make sure we were talking about the same thing. (Hofmann) I don't see any alternatives. We must give special treatment to the resilient . Otherwise we risk a new Jewish construction. The experience of history should be a warning to us. The Romans expelled the Jews all over the world. And thought the problem was solved . Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that. We can now take the plunge. Anyone who wants to keep the body politic healthy must not be afraid to completely eliminate all germs of destruction . The Jew is and remains the eternal parasite that spreads just as there is favorable breeding ground for it. like a rotten mold which settles on the cultures of healthy peoples. But it is a fundamental requirement ethnic, national and social hygiene, to eradicate the pathogen down to the last herd. We plan to proceed thoroughly and without gaps. Up to now you have only spoken of the able-bodied Jews. What is the procedure for those who are unable to work? Good question. In the ghettos this should account for a good half. If not even more. Those who are not useful to us will be successively worked away. The necessary capacities are currently being created for this . Then the final destination of the journey is the same for all Jews? Working or not? It is exactly like that. Surely will become part of the solution to this problem still play out a whole lot of personal tragedies. But that is inevitable. Now the situation is ripe bring the Jewish question to a final solution. Later generations will no longer have the energy and no longer have the alertness of instinct. What we burden ourselves with today will be an advantage and happiness for our descendants . I can already see problems coming our way. With what exactly? With the special treatment of Jews who are unable to work. We're talking about the old ones, aren't we? And precisely among the elderly there are precisely those Jews who who took part in the World War on the German side . Side by side with those of us who were there. I didn't fight with Jews. - At that time no distinction was made. Maybe you didn't even notice. In view of this problem we have a simple, but found a very effective way . Eichmann? Reich Jews over the age of 65 and Jews severely injured in the war or those with war decorations are not evacuated, but transferred to an old age ghetto. With this practical solution , you can be in one fell swoop switched off the many interventions . May I know where this old age ghetto will be again? Do not worry. You do n't have to do everything alone. Theresienstadt is planned. In my area of ​​responsibility. I'm not above putting on a hand myself. Far be it from me to even imply that. Eichmann visited Theresienstadt yesterday. The conversion is already underway. We'll be there shortly can accommodate several 10,000 Jews . Since it is a former fortress building, is with the simplest means a maximum of security can be achieved. In addition, the site consists of solid, well-built buildings. It is quite conceivable to make the place a kind of model ghetto. So could of this solution by the way a great reassurance of the population. Great. We deliver the Jewish atrocity propaganda abroad direct evidence to the contrary. "Invitation to Theresienstadt. Come and see: This is how Germans treat their Jews." But won't that be very expensive? accommodate tens of thousands of people ? Residents will be billed for their accommodation. Just like the Jews we brought to emigrate bear the transport costs themselves. We don't pay anything for the Jews. But then we have Jews left over after all. And ten thousand times over. Old Jews, group leader. proliferation unlikely. The problem solves itself biologically, so to speak. The residents of the ghetto will also be transferred to the final solution in due course. Then I don't want to have said anything. After the dejudaization , my men do it from Theresienstadt a good German settlement. That would also clear that up. Gentlemen, I propose a short break. You are now aware of the main features of our project. There are still two topics waiting for us, more of a departmental nature. You can take provisions in the salon . To be continued in, say, ten minutes? *unintelligible* We really have a lot ahead of us. * Soft babble of voices * All European Jewry. Who would have expected that? Adequate to the visions of the leader. You can tell that to your grandchildren. Who can claim to have witnessed world history up close ? I want to say, co-designed. Am I correct? Salmon sandwich? The supply situation in the Reich Security Main Office seems still good. But that's friendly. Thank you very much. Not that we have a bad climate. We don't. On the contrary. Just think of our last evening of music. How could I forget that? So I think we often have a lot of fun. In any case, there is more laughter than in other presentations. That's nice to hear. Things are actually moving. Heydrich has taken the helm firmly. Yeah, and he makes it look like like the mess of the past few months Part of a grander plan now unfolding. Don't you think so? I would say one third plan, two thirds chaos. And the chaos is now unceremoniously declared part of the plan. The pressure in the boiler increases. Everyone wants to get rid of their Jews, nobody wants them. Yes, one would like these days be a Jew these days either. Gauleiter. - Doctor Freisler. You said earlier that you were in the Fiihrer's private apartment? In December, at the meeting of the Reich and Gau leaders. Interesting. - What exactly? Yes, well, imagine it sounds incredible but I have never met the Führer in person. Well so what. - Ah. Believe you could in suitable place put in a good word for me? For a personal meeting with the guide, in any context? Naturally. I'd love to. May I you something brought to you? No thanks. They swallowed the bitterest pills . timing and extent of evacuations. And all this under our leadership. We're not finished yet. Don't underestimate Doctor Stuckart. We have n't even touched on his favorite topic yet. I admit you surprised me. Then my visit to Berlin was worth it. Millions of new Jews are announced to you , and you don't change your face. There were agreements. They accept his leadership. In return, he gives you the promise start with the final solution at your door. I hope for you that Heydrich sticks to it. What do you mean by that? It is an honor to be the site of the final solution. I know the Jewish question is the Fuhrer's favorite child. And everyone wants to hold it. i know frank It will eat you up if you come back to Kraków without promises. Governor General Frank has no problem 10,000 Jews if we get rid of 20,000 in the same breath. Very deep breaths. Big measures have been announced. I've heard of this. I'm not authorized to talk about it. Peaceful. Very. Heinz Rühmann lives here somewhere. Likewise Minister Speer. Down there is Max Liebermann's villa. The painter. - I know. Jewish impressionist. You are a man of education. And that surprises you. In view of my tasks in the east. You probably hear that more often. Occasionally. would you have dreamed that you will leave your desk in Berlin overnight have to swap with such a mission in Latvia? So you can experience from your own perspective, what is decided at the desks . What's wrong with that? These events over there in the east. One hears of derailments. brutalities. execution ditches. I see it as a craft. You learn it, and eventually you will be able to. Some better, others worse. How do your men stand it? Every day these actions? Whole villages? We emphasize the necessity of the mission. And getting used to it and an extra portion of liquor will do the rest. Schnaps blurs the impressions of the day. Only if they drink while they work one must intervene. Too many misses and then the half-dead work themselves out of the pits overnight. And you have to shoot them again the next morning . I did n't mean to offend you. You were in the trenches yourself. We shot at soldiers. Not women and children. I have a husband who prefers to shoot at children. Because they can't survive without their parents anyway. He thinks he's doing the kids a favor. Has its logic, don't you think? The meeting continues. * Soft babble of voices * Gentlemen, I hope you feel strengthened. We now come to the central question of the final solution, namely laying down for the evacuation eligible persons. Who benefits from our transport and who does not? There is a need for clarification in this regard among Jews living abroad and mixed Jews and mixed marriages. I have to disagree. Their treatment is sufficiently regulated through our existing Jewish laws. There are different opinions about this. You speak of opinions, I speak of laws. Let's start with the Jews abroad. Undersecretary of State Luther, would you please give us a brief overview? * Luther clears his throat. * Jews abroad. Currently there are about 40,000 Jews with a foreign passport on German territory. dear time Who on earth are these people? Yes, they are not welcome here. It is mainly about Hungarian, Czech, also Slovak Jews? That's right. We got most of them when we joined Austria. Can we change that please? If they are nationals of enemy powers, yes. For Jews from friendly or influenced states however, we consider it a matter of courtesy to at least ask the governments whether we are their Jewish citizens to include in our projects . Who would say "no" to such an offer? It's almost like asking my neighbor if I can shovel his crap away too. Slovakia and Croatia agree. We are on the right track with Romania and Bulgaria . These countries give us access to their citizens? No objections. Can everything go. Only Hungary is still reluctant. And Slovakia is claiming it on the assets of the affected Jews. Why doesn't that surprise me? * Laugh * Money doesn't stink. Maybe we'll do them a favor. Four Year Plan Authority? Well, if it 's for expeditious deportation, let's not be petty. It shouldn't be a question of too large a sum anyway. Thank you for your kindness. You heard it. Except for the Hungarians, we can stamp out all foreign Jews. How about France? Eichmann obviously has new insights here. The Wehrmacht has the need of our crackdown now accepted. The Jews who fled are already interned. Transports are imminent. We should wait with the French Jews . Does Mr. Eichmann now also work in the Foreign Office? Interministerial Cooperation. Let's stay on topic please. Belgium? Holland? We can operate completely freely throughout western and south-eastern Europe . Good. Let's initiate what is necessary. Is noted. I still see difficulties in the north. Denmark, Norway, Finland. - Why there? Inexplicably , the population there is heavy to convince of the dangerousness of the Jewish race. What do you suggest? Ignore for now. The numbers are small. Procrastination is actually not our style. But as long as we are busy with the Jews of other countries. Please. Because of me. What shall we do with Hungary? It's time the government there to impose one of our calibrated advisors on Jewish issues. Maybe someone on your staff, Obersturmbannfuhrer? Could you spare someone? If I may help out? The Race and Settlement Main Office can hire an employee as assistants to the police attache. Nice. Why not? Let's do it like this. Excuse me, our foreign policy will be from now on designed by Mr. Hofmann's employees? Don't dress in your shirt. We're not talking about a new ambassador. An adviser with no diplomatic experience. But he has experience in Jewish issues. That's something too. I am again irritated by the generosity with which some offices disclose their competences. I don't break a tooth out of the crown. The main thing is that the matter is settled. It's nice when it's easy. I see it differently. I don't call a roofer to garden. In my office there are some people who move well-versed on the international stage. In my opinion, not everyone is equally suitable. If you refer to responsibilities, please stick to yours too and leave the Undersecretary of State Luther his. We'll do it as discussed. Abroad Jews ticked off with that? (Luther) We see the possibility to offer the Fuhrer a Jew-free Serbia without much effort. Interesting. Keep talking. Later in a small group? Better now in a small group. miller? Eichman? How many are we talking about? About 6000 to 8000. Only women and children. Why no male Jews? Have been shot as hostages. 100 each for a dead German. I remember. Very effective measure. Thank you, Obergruppenfuhrer. Serbian government? We don't have to serve. Who do we give the command? Maybe shepherd. Who blew up the transmitter in Gleiwitz. Ah. Good man. We can give him the gas vans that were meant for Riga. That won't please me for a long time. Lange should improvise. We will do it like that. Roger that. I initiate everything. Gentlemen, we have one last item on the agenda, namely the treatment of those already mentioned Mixed Jews and mixed marriages. And at this point, Doctor Stuckart, your opinion is not only asked, but downright necessary. The treatment of these questions is governed by applicable laws. It's your law too. And of course they should continue to do so serve as the basis for the discussion. It is a valid law not a basis for discussion. Laws are also getting on in years and need to be reassessed. Like how to wallpaper an apartment in a new color? We must recognize that today, people and race the categories of our actions must be. Our people need a valid law. And I feel committed to that. What is good for the people is right, Doctor Stuckart. What is the value of rights and norms do they contradict popular sentiment? (Meyer) That's exactly how it is. Let's not make things more complicated than they are. Let's not make them simpler than they are either. Where exactly do you see a need for action? The half-Jews are known to be largely exempt from evacuations and special treatment. Should that be changed? There were talks about between us, the party, individual ministries. I asked the party chancellery summarize these conversations for us. Doctor Thumper? Well, the party line is clear. Jews, i.e. half-Jews, quarter-Jews, on the part of the party, all these half-breeds are ultimately Jews and as such can not be tolerated as part of the people. The distinction between good Jews, bad Jews, Whole Jew, half Jew, that is no longer effective. Agree. I speak for all SS main offices. In the sense of national hygiene and racial land consolidation. So what exactly do you have in mind? A paper was prepared on the subject which I would like to bring to the reading . Please. First: First degree half-breeds are in view placed on an equal footing with the Jews in the final solution to the Jewish question . Rejected. For now, just listen. That point alone violates applicable law. Mischlinge of the first degree are equated with people of German blood. This rule should be changed. Yes, that's not easy. We cannot decide that they wear the yellow star. Or that they are not allowed to enter a forest or hold a bird. And certainly not that they will be evacuated next. It's a working paper. - The draft provides for exceptions. Right. Exceptions are mixed race of the first degree, married to people of German blood. That's what I'm expecting. Insofar as they have children, quarter Jews. (sarcastic) How generous. Our suggestion for this meets you elsewhere . Mischline second degree, quarter Jews, are all assigned to the German blood. wait a minute Why that? So unless they come from a bastard marriage of two half-breed parents, have an unfavorable, Jewish appearance or they prove by their behavior, that they are to be assigned to the Jews . I'm starting to lose track. I think that's practical. May I ask the group for an opinion? In terms of foreign policy, it doesn't matter at all whether the half-breeds stay or go. The Reich Marshal would certainly not object as long as we don't lose any more armor workers. This is taken care of. In my eyes, a quarter Jew is also a Jew. We could definitely expand the concept of a Jew from a legal point of view. But I wonder why we care about Jewish laws when there will soon be no more Jews at all. Interesting stance for the Justice Department. Here in the East we can not make such distinctions at all. We cannot determine who is Jewish. Let alone half or quarter Jew. But we are not in the East here. Laws still apply here. However, you must also recognize that your Home Office is increasingly isolated. What do you hope to achieve with the changes? simplifications. As always. Clear, quick decisions. You achieve the exact opposite. Just reopen the individual case checks. We're talking about tens of thousands of individual cases. How many half-Jews in the Reich? Roughly estimated around 70,000. And the Quarter Jews too and our officials are busy for years. Don't we have anything better to do? If only you hadn't written such half-baked laws. I didn't write them alone . And that's not true. A half-Jew who acts Jewish, adheres to the Mosaic faith or has a Jewish partner, is treated as a full Jew by law. So it can be evacuated. How many of the accepted Jews in the Reich? About 8000. Eight railway trains. Still over 60,000 remain. The majority of the half-Jews feel they belong to the German community. Inwardly rejects Judaism. Pure protective claim. Thousands of these half-breeds have proven themselves in our Wehrmacht. How many? About 10,000. That leaves over 50,000 that I'd like to get rid of. Think of the SS comrades whose breed test revealed that they have Jewish blood in them. Tragic cases indeed. But they are small in number. It is the German blood in the half-breeds that prevails here. And these people should we now lead to the final solution? For these special cases we can find exceptions. Fine, let's think about it then. So, according to your suggestion , would be a half-Jew not to be evacuated with a German wife and children . Heaven. - I've been out for a long time. Half-Jew with a German wife and children. That is correct. Will not be evacuated. Nice. But now this half-Jew has a brother. Naturally, he is also a half-Jew. He has neither married nor does he have children. He will be evacuated according to your suggestion. Correctly. And how do you explain that to the family? The fully Aryan woman? The full Aryan relatives? You can dramatize anything. I don't. I'm just thinking this through. You can't treat quarter Jews like Germans, but at the same time evacuate their half-Jewish family to the East. What do you say to the quarter-Jewish soldier on home leave, why his relatives on the platform opposite ride east in a cattle car? Those are all isolated cases. I tend to agree with Doctor Stuckart. A public concern must also be avoided from the point of view of the guide . I only remember the euthanasia campaign the central office T4. That made waves. I think stucco complicates things. They are complicated. That is why the leader in this question no other instruction was given. But maybe you hold themselves to be smarter than the Führer in this respect . (Hofmann) He speaks of the final solution. Everything Jewish has to be eradicated from the body politic. Your suggestions create unbearable conditions. In extreme cases even chaos. And out of chaos comes resistance. We certainly don't want the half-breeds as enemies . He is characterized by his high-quality Germanic heritage more dangerous than the Jew. High-quality half-Jews? Do you have a constructive suggestion? Very good question. My suggestion is to do nothing. We shouldn't do anything. Are you not serious now? Half-Jews are only allowed to marry Germans. So the Jewish part is lost with each generation by itself. Even the children are only quarter Jews. We wo n't be finished in 100 years. Half Jew, Quarter Jew. If I don't like his nose, the Jew is enough for me. Pretty rough grid, don't you think? So no one is tempted to see me as a Jew friend. I am aware that you are doing great things in the East. Please don't believe that I do less here at my desk, just because I'm not knee-deep in Jew blood. Without our laws our empire would not exist, where it is today. No one accuses you of lack of commitment, Doctor Stuckart. As I said, we are looking for ways to simplify things as much as possible. In this case I suggest sterilizations. Sterilisation? How may I understand that? forced sterilizations. For all half-breeds, without exception. Less expensive than deportations and absolutely sufficient from the point of view of racial hygiene. (Leibbrandt) Interesting suggestion, Doctor Stuckart. All biologically hazardous elements would be excluded from reproduction . The danger of racial disintegration would be averted. Is this technically feasible at all? in this magnitude? You would have to check that. given the choice, whether it should be evacuated or sterilized, the mongrel would certainly prefer undergo sterilization. As a blood type , the half-breeds would be finished. They stayed with us as workers . This is a tailor-made solution. Forced divorces would also be conceivable. They wanted to simplify things. Here you go. (knock) So, I, um... Here are a few more suggestions on the subject of mixed marriages. So, marriages between people of German blood and full Jews. We interrupt. Dr. Stuckart? * Door is opened. * Gentlemen, in the saloon you will find fresh coffee, sweets and cognac. We'll continue in a few minutes. * Soft babble of voices * The working paper on the half- breeds please for the record. * Stuckart clears his throat. * You have good arguments. And you know how to recite them. And yet you approach the subject unabated. Once in a while... Allow me the honesty. Sometimes I wonder if you... resist our proposals because of these good arguments , or ... because it is your laws that are at issue here. I wish you were lawyers for us Don't just see it as a brake on your locomotive. My main office is full of lawyers. This is a different blow. Like Doctor Schoengarth. Or Doctor Lange. I appreciate enthusiasm and willingness to act. lawyers, that cause complications and doubts, I can use less. thinking is beautiful. But action is better. Action without thinking achieves nothing. You throw the baby out with the bath water. forced sterilizations. Are you serious? Or are you just suggesting that because you know that it will take us months to check that? Just like you, I see myself committed to the Führer's will. I'm not arguing against your plans for a final solution. I'm just arguing for the need for an orderly disenfranchisement. I have the utmost respect for what you do made from the Reich Security Main Office . An ideologically stable, fighting administration, ready for a radical crackdown. But don't forget that not all of Germany is like that. People need rules and norms. clarity and orientation. The knowledge that everything is in order. Thanks very much. We will check that. Thank you. Apart from that you are of course right. I wrote ten pounds of Jewish laws. if you take them away from me I might as well go to the office without pants. Of course we absolutely have to prevent that. Has your wife settled in? On my last visit I had the impression that she doesn't feel comfortable in Prague. long gone. Recently she said: "I'm a princess and I live in a castle." That's nice to hear. And with you? What is the offspring doing? It's still a few weeks. Visit us. As soon as we can set it up. Are you planning to move your residence here after the war? The house suits you. Possibly. That would make us neighbors. Our children could swim together in the Wannsee. A nice thought. There was an agreement between the Reichsfuhrer SS and Governor General Frank. And it's my right to insist on compliance with this agreement. You heard Heydrich. That's all I can do for you. We don't want to be responsible for a huge slum with millions of vegetating Jews. I can't come to Frank with that. I will get some coffee. May I bring you one too? I thought there was work going on here. Gentlemen, we continue. Stay here. We're almost at the end. We can move on to the informal part. My papers, please. If you want. Stuckart and I had a good conversation. Get Kritzinger. Any questions at this point? I see myself forced, to ask again about the exact course of the final solution. And I must reiterate the imperative with the planned relief measures to begin with us in the General Government. Why you? It is not acceptable that we provide the largest final solution spaces and be made the rubbish heap of the empire , on which all their Jews and gypsies and asocials dump, and at the same time we are left with our own Jews. Epidemics, smuggling, crime. Nice, Bühler, so we do n't get too worked up about it again, for free. Pole Jews first. Forgiveness? You have my word. We'll start in the General Government. Greetings to Governor General Frank. And can I assume that this appointment is recorded in the minutes? Lieutenant Colonel? It is noted. On the other hand, may I assume that your Governor-General no longer governed in our actions? Leading the final solution with us? No further questions. - Thank God. * Everyone's laughing. * But I have one more question. I hate to disturb the general happiness but since the beginning of the meeting I have a recurring question of a fundamental nature. Please. Pleas e ask your question. Thanks. We have now learned much about the Final Solution, but next to nothing about concrete possible solutions. The Reich Security Main Office knows what it is doing. Well, the question arises for me whether we are talking here about mere declarations of intent, or about realistic goals. I can assure you, we don't build castles in the air. If you allow me, I did some calculations, on the basis of the task force reports available to me . Let's take the special treatment of Ukrainian Jews, At the end of September, carried out by the Einsatzgruppe C under the direction of Obergruppenfuhrer Jeckeln. One of our best. (Kritzinger) I'm talking about the measures taken against the Jews of Kiev. The Jews behaved largely cooperative thanks to reassuring preliminary measures . And for further disposal a natural gorge could be used. There was therefore no need to dig trenches . I know. Babyn Yar Gorge. Parts of the Sixth Army were there, under von Reichenau. God bless him. - That's my point. In this case you could speak of almost ideal conditions. And yet required special treatment of 33,771 Jews a period of around 36 hours. 1000 an hour. What's wrong with that? In fact, there are 938. If you do this now with the number mentioned by Obersturmbannfuhrer Eichmann want to extrapolate from eleven million , then that makes around 11,270 hours. Or 488 days. What's your point? As part of the final solution , our men would have to do what was done at Babyn Yar for 488 days. Day and night, mind you, without a break. Shoot Jews for 488 days. old people, women and children. 938 per hour. - I ask you. In this form, your calculation is very hypothetical. The work is spread over many shoulders, in many places. However, we are indeed talking about eleven million rounds of ammunition. And that in times of war. But only if every shot hits the mark. It's true that we won't get there with shooting alone . For this reason, institutions are currently emerging whose only purpose is to defuse this numerical problem in our favour. Maybe it's because, that I'm a bit older than most of the group, or pastor's son, but for me there is also a question of a moral nature. With all due respect, I don't need to listen to that. "The poor Jews. The dear women and children." We do our duty. And we wo n't let dirt be thrown at us for that. you misunderstand me - I understand you perfectly. You also attacked a long time with your humanitarianism. I must defend my comrades resolutely. The Jews get a criminal court that seems barbaric, but they fully deserve it. I'm surprised you 're still having this discussion. There is an emergency situation. If we don't defend ourselves against the Jews, they will destroy us. Please gentlemen. My concern isn't with the Jews. I am also aware that the history of the Jewish race is finished. My concern is for our men alone. And the emotional strain that the final solution represents for them. You mean for the Wehrmacht, SS and the Order Police? We're talking about boys here not yet fully established people. We were those people once. Us such experiences as at the special actions in Kiev, over 33,000 piled to mountains, Yes, something like that inevitably leads to rudeness. Sadism. Mental illness and alcoholism. For my men, I can say that we know our trade. We shoot with attached bayonet, kneeling from behind. There are hardly any misses. You can imagine orderly processes. That may be all. But we want these men get back as healthy German men . husbands of German women. fathers of German children. In our field hospitals we do indeed dive increasingly nervous diseases, triggered by the difficult experiences in the East. There's no denying that. I have been told that some men who took part, whose nerves were more down than those who who were shot there. (Schöngarth) Crudeness. Sadism. Just because one is in the service of the Jew must show hard and mercilessly he's still a decent German. I can confirm. There is certainly a harsh tone. But we don't steal, curse or... Or beaten or behaved dishonestly. Nobody doubts your decency, gentlemen. Nevertheless, I am Ministerial Director Kritzinger grateful for his question, to which we don't want to close ourselves. So many who are just very eager lectured on the need for the final solution, becomes very still when looking at the final solution. The Reichsfuhrer SS personally , if I may interject, witnessed a shooting and immediately gave the order to find a more humane method. more humane? For our men? Of course. I promised you at the beginning that at the end of our session you will realize that we are able to answer all questions. Lieutenant Colonel? In the rear front area or there, where transport by rail would be too expensive, we will not get along without shootings in the future. However , the method is too inefficient for the final solution and ends up having a negative impact on the functionality of our men. The functionality of my... Doctor Schoengarth, please. The other, more efficient and for the mental life of those involved less stressful methods are based on knowledge the euthanasia campaign of the central office T4. The action mercy death? - Protests broke them up. (Luther) And of the churches. When it comes to the transport of Jews , they politely hold back. They scream at the crazy ones. Still. 70,000 were done. After all. After hiring, the gentlemen started working for us. (Kritzinger) Sorry. When we speak of Brack's methods, then are we talking about gas? That is correct. What other means is so efficient? Gentlemen, the World War II participants among us experienced what that means. Gas. poison gas. When you're in the trenches. I don't know about you, gentlemen, but I find that thought terrifying. That was over 20 years ago. A lot has happened there. I have been inspecting the Kulmhof camp for the past few months and the Belzec camp under Hauptsturmfuhrer Wirth. Both facilities use carbon monoxide. Trucks with gas-tight superstructures are used in Kulmhof . Belzec has rooms in which gas is bottled or stationary tank engines is initiated. There are also newer findings from Obersturmbannfuhrer Höß. Please who? He commands a camp for Russians in eastern Upper Silesia. The Obergruppenfuhrer already mentioned it. Auschwitz. Höß' men achieved very promising results there when using a pest control agent. Handelsname "Zyklon B". pest control? Interesting. ship holds. silos. Large area disinfection. Well, that fits. It is also used for soiled uniforms. The active substance used is hydrocyanic acid, bound to granules. A fast-acting gas is formed on contact with air . A rather accidental discovery. Accidents have occurred due to improper use. That's how the comrades came up with it. So we explain the incorrect usage for proper use? Just as. We receive the granules in the form of handy canisters. Ready portioned. The manufacturer can also supply it without added warning material. By the time you notice the gas, it's already too late. According to Höss, last year's test gassing went well of Russian POWs, around 900, very satisfactory. And what's the point? Carbon monoxide or hydrocyanic acid? Höss is very convinced of his method. At the moment it's more of a mind game but it would be possible to convert the Auschwitz camp from Russians to Jews. I plan to propose to the Reichsfuhrer SS to continue on all rails. Competition stimulates business. *laughter* How do we have to imagine these processes in detail? The Jews reach our facilities, as described, by train, are then selected according to their ability to work and give up their possessions. Under the pretense of disinfection they are then taken to airtight gassing rooms. The respective active ingredient is introduced from the outside. The process itself, done correctly, is done in ten to fifteen minutes. The rooms are then ventilated as well as removal and disposal. In the medium term, we plan to incinerate in high-performance furnaces. In Auschwitz, models from the company "Topf &amp; Söhne" are already being made, where we have the capacities obviously have to expand considerably. Straight from the train to the gas. So no accommodation required? That's very efficient. - (Leibbrandt) One moment, please. This is not a concern to fear from the neighboring population ? I'm missing that. We pay attention to geographic remoteness. Our systems only require a siding and nearby settlement-free zones to reduce odor. How many of the facilities are there currently? Kulmhof relieves the Litzmannstadt camp. Belzec is about to go into operation. Construction work will soon begin in the Sobibor camp. There are further considerations for Treblinka. And Auschwitz is a possibility. Do we have the necessary men for so many institutions? The operation is not personnel-intensive, because we involve Jews and external helpers. Our own men just take care of it to ensure orderly processes and the release of gases. But the sight of all those dead? The transport to the ovens? Will be done by working Jews, which in turn are ultimately also given special treatment. (Meyer) Elegant. And the capacity is up to the size of our task? We are still in the planning phase. Processes have to be found and optimized. But technically there is nothing wrong with create gas-tight rooms for up to 1000 people. Camp Auschwitz would even offer space for several rooms of this type, so that we would be able at any time finish off a fully loaded train in one go. This process can of course be repeated several times a day. Ministerialdirektor, you seem... skeptical? All this maybe solve our problems of a mathematical nature. But what exactly is better about it than shooting it? I have executions in the Ostland and witnessed the use of the special trucks in Kulmhof, and I'm not ashamed to say that both hit me in the stomach. The stationary systems allow structured processes based on the division of labour. There is practically no contact between those affected and those involved. Any closeness and pitiful stimuli are gone. I and all the specialists involved are convinced that we have a pleasantly technical, achieve an efficient and completely anonymous process, that of our men can be done in a distant way . Very impressive. The whole thing seems well thought out to me. As a matter of fact. We are convinced of that. Would you agree with that? Nun... If that really spares us the bloodbaths of the shootings and our men are thereby spared, then that is a great relief for me . Knowing that we've done everything humanly possible. Even if I'd rather the Jews would simply vanish into thin air. Who wouldn't rather live in peace? But fate chose our generation to solve this task. And we ca n't refuse just because we hate it. We are, so to speak, physicians to the German body politic. And no doctor likes to saw off a patient's leg. But what if it 's the only way save the patient's life? Gentlemen, we're through with that. If there are no further questions on this topic, I would suggest that representatives of the central authorities continue the talks at speaker level. My presentation will focus on this liaise with the departments . Do we get a log? Also about us. Then thank you for coming and wanted to ask again us in carrying out the final solution to send your valued support . That was it. Obergruppenfuhrer. * Soft babble of voices * My notes, Obersturmbannfuhrer. We will only roughly summarize them. Will you send me your notes? I'll put them on your desk. Do that. I'll call you a car. (Werlemann) Thank you very much. Good job Eichman. Thank you, squad leader. Interesting day. Some things are probably better left to the younger ones. We'll see what's left of the big plans. The working paper on the half-breeds, you don't blame me, do you? We are civil servants. We are committed to our offices. That's the way it is. I've spent so many years with Jew laws if you take them away from me, I lose no sleep. Surely you're not giving up. Not without resistance. I say goodbye. I have another meeting at four. Restructuring in the Ministry of Posts. Well, you have a condition. - We all have to make sacrifices. * Engine started. * Wasn't that bad after all. My need for meetings is covered for now. You did well. - Oh well. I know a few very dignified establishments in Berlin, where you can relax in the most pleasant way. Sounds interesting. One for you too? I won't say no to that. Thank you. Cognac for you too? I still have appointments. But don't be put off. I hope you are happy with the results. Approval for the plan from all stakeholders. No one doubts our leadership. Successful event. Protocol as always? First to me. 30 carbon copies? Dispatch as a secret Reich matter. Dress everything in official words. We don't want to scare anyone. But each of the gentlemen may read it, what he was involved in. Not that it means nobody knew anything. Understand. Nice. March goal achieved for today. It was worth coming to Berlin after all. I wish you a pleasant afternoon. You too. And have a safe flight home. Thanks. Subtitles commissioned by ZDF,
