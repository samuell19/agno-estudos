Subtitle by Herry AM Have you heard the news? The competition now will not be able to pass if the score is less than 270. The national team's standards are getting higher. But I heard... there's no preliminary rounds. Don't worry. You've been preparing for a long time. According to seniors, if I'm not selected, I have to quit the team. - What? - Hey... be careful... Are you okay? Injured? - Just kidding. - Damn. Who told you to do that. Please stop. The diving first ranking, Lee Young. She'll do a very difficult technique. Very nice. Lee Young gave a beautiful opening. It's amazing. Yes. Beautiful and perfect jump. She's really very confident. Yes, very interesting. Lee Young... Soo Jin... When do you go here? Why don't you wait for me? I'll quit. Were the seniors who told you? After I quit, you should change your room. It's been a long time there. Because I love it, you always stay with me. Don't listen to seniors. We're a team I want to be with Soo Jin. You know her condition too. Because of that, it won't bring results. Why is this with her? Lee Young, you have to keep training hard. If you continue to do this, it won't help her either. Just ended? So what, Triple Jump? Both of you never practice that, you think it's so easy? I know her for a long time. I can't just leave her alone. Now, it's the Olympic selection. All people hope in you. Don't disappoint. Can't the two of us? What if you fail? If you can't, you still have to quit. When it happen, you can give up? Now I have chosen and won't give up. Are you newbie? Leaving now? - Yes. Why? Let's practice together. - What? - This is our team. Good, right? Everything will be alright. You don't want to just give up, do you? Try one more time with me. - Count to 3. - No, it'll hurt. - 1, 2, 3 - Wait. Congratulations for your first jump. Count to 3 then spin. Start. 1, 2... - So confused. - What? At least both of you have to jump, right? Don't feel sorry? For you, we all can't train. It's not like that. What's wrong with you? I heard the chief is coming next week. The chief wants to make sure whether both of you can be a team or not. Why will he that decide? He wants you to train yourself. The number you have dialed is not active. Hey, what time is it, still not answering the call? They are a pair. Very beautiful. They are... like you, right? Very beautiful. I don't know what else to say. Tomorrow, I'll call... No need. In any case, sooner or later must come out. That's how the diving is. Taking a close look... getting into the water, ugly and funny face. What does it mean? Don't want to look poor. Start. 1, 2... I heard Soo Jin saw Chu Wei Long... What? She used to be very famous, then somehow she was suicide. I know her. It's impossible to see a dead person. There is one rumor. If we see her, our ability is much greater. Damn it. Lately, Soo Jin looks like that. Better than Lee Young. I feel like today, we don't talk much. Why does it look like I'm the only one who's happy? Soo Jin. - Soo Jin - Why? Don't use medicine. Don't do that. The diving athlete, Lee Young... after the incident, she had amnesia for one week. All of her fans wish her recover quickly. According to the hospital, there's no suspicious symptoms. Many people don't believe it. Police are investigating... Why do you come out? What did the doctor say? Maybe feeling fine now, but... there may be side effects. You should be careful. I heard you don't remember at all. Weird feeling. I felt just a short nap. Apparently, it's been a week. Today, Soo Jin trains too? Why didn't she call me? She knows I'm awake, right? Both of you went together when I called Soo Jin last time. She said both of you were drunk, and hung out to get some fresh air. Are you Lee Young? We're the police. Come in. The car is in your manager's name. Does Soo Jin often drive a car? When we go to the training place, we take turns driving. So she's used to driving, right? Have you ever seen her drive in drunk condition before? According to the results of investigation, both of you drank a lot, didn't you? No, she didn't drink alcohol. However, there are many suspicious things at the crime scene. Because there's no CCTV, we have to know her condition at that time. That way, we can continue the investigation. Even if it itches, you shouldn't scratch it. This wound doesn't look severe. But if it's untreated, it'll become infected. To be honest, Lee Young is too insistent on participating in this competition. I heard she doesn't remember that incident. Soo Jin really bothered Lee Young. Soo Jin is a pity too. Pity? She shouldn't go to Seoul. Counting on Lee Young to get a lot of opportunities. Training is more important. Why do you come here? You are hurt. How could we not come here? Thank you, but don't talk about other people carelessly. Sorry. No need to say sorry to me. Lee Young, we'll go out. Next time we'll come again. Just go out, I'll clean up. Lee Young... At that time.. Never mind. I heard Soo Jin saw Chu Wei Long. Lately, she was more awesome than Lee Young. Hey, don't talk carelessly, okay? - Do you see Soo Jin? - Over there. I'm not badly injured. I'm starting to heal now. Can you train now? - Still participate for selection? - What about the Olympics? The time is getting closer. I'll try not to disappoint you. Park Soo Jin has disappeared, what do you feel? Lee Young will jump. Lee Young... No need for training today, come down. Are you okay? That's right. Now you need to train alone. There were lots of people. Tt's such a mess. Looking for another place. Time is not certain. It's very difficult to persuade them. They asked when you can start. They can't wait anymore. Be careful... It can be postponed, right? I know. Wait, there's still one thing. At least, let's cooperate. You have to look at me. Relax, it's only until the half day. This can't be used anymore. Help me find another place. 1, 2... backwards... spin... He has agreed. I can participate in the single diving. Because of you, even if I fall, there will be no problem. We found it. It belongs to Soo Jin. At that time, you said that Soo Jin never drank alcohol. According to reports, last year... Soo Jin had an accident due to alcohol. Making peace with the victim, they don't report to the police. I told you that she didn't drink alcohol. Coach, looks like you know Soo Jin drank alcohol. Yes, but what's the connection with that incident? Of course, there are accidents not because of drinking alcohol. But, it's hard to believe that wasn't because of drinking. Judging from the crime scene, at least it was above 100 KM/H. Roads like that, under normal conditions, it was impossible to drive so fast. Park Soo Jin. Park Soo Jin. 1st place national diving, Park Soo Jin. Are you Lee Young? I just knew at that time that she was drunk too. She said she was like a locked diary. That's not like her style, right? Before the incident, what were you talking about? At that time... Hiding something from me? No. What do you want to know? It's very strange. What's exactly happened? - Are you mad at her? - What? Lately, you train alone? I don't understand what you said. I feel ridiculous. - Every I think of her, I feel something. - Maybe she's jealous of you. Soo Jin... What's wrong? Hospital... Let's go to the hospital. Died? No, but it's bad. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Number 5, Soo Jin. Last jump, 2 spin, very difficult position. Hopefully she will get high scores. Everyone can't wait to see the results. Still afraid of diving? Excuse me. What's the matter? It is dead. - Dead? - Yes. It was still fine just now. Mixed with other types of fish? - Yes. - It can't be placed in the same place. Otherwise it'll be weak and die. Are you here just for that? - What? - Never mind. Who bought it? - A friend. - Buy here? Strange. If you buy here, I'll definitely explain. Was it possible to kill it on purpose? If not? If she killed it accidentally, why did she do that? What does it mean? Wrong? Soo Jin is like that fish, another is like Lee Young, right? I'll give you another. It's beautiful, but it's hard to take care of. This is... just like you, right? It's not the medicine you think of. Sedatives are also illegal drugs. No. We need that to get excited. If I help you to keep the secret, can Lee Young place be gived to me? Can't be with me? You want to be on the national team, right? - Nobody is better... - You hate Lee Young, right? So that you talk like that, right? Understandable. Lee Young is perfect. Feeling inferior to people like her. But think again, what did she do to you? She's nice to me, because she feel guilty, ruined my life. Soo Jin. Soo Jin. Why? Don't use drugs. Don't be like that. What? You mean, I made progress because of drugs? At least, you shouldn't suspect me, right? Or are you afraid I'll take your place? I heard your conversation. Didn't the coach say before the competition finished... don't tell me about my mother's condition? But why you tell me. Because you want to be the best, right? At that time, Soo Jin wanted to kill me. She wanted to kill me. She shouldn't do it to me. I advised the best for her. I really didn't know. She hated and wanted to kill me. Don't lie. You already know. What? You already know. No... really not. Really? You definitely know. - I really don't know. - Think carefully. Lee Young... Why was she suddenly fainted? After entering the police station, she stood there for a long time and then fainted. Fainted, I'm so frustrated. Lee Young's condition hasn't been so good lately. I'm sorry. I already know in her heart... Soo Jin is important for her. Lee Young... Help me process the hospital administration. Yesterday, the police received a report, someone bought illegal drugs. The police took action immediately, arresting the shop owner. One of the buyers of illegal drugs named "Chu Wei Long''. The police are investigating everyone involved. Hello. Can we come in? Just talk. Since that incident, Park Soo Jin is still missing. We hope this is just an ordinary incident. We hope it can be resolved quickly. - Nice. - What? Even if the investigation is stopped, we'll still try to find her. Are you okay? What? No. Sorry to bother you. It's okay. The future will be better. I hope you are like me, even if only once. I am different from you. What do you feel now? I feel like I've rediscovered myself. I can be more confident. Since that incident, you don't dare to diving. Is that true? That's not true. How can you handle that incident? Diving calms me down. So, I want you to see... I can handle myself. Wait. Excuse me, are you Lee Young? I'm your fans. I saw your competition. Thanks. Your condition has recovered? Wow, you falling from height is still okay. What a fortune. Do you live here? Next time, I want to come here often. I always support you. For a friend who died, keep spirit. No matter how tired I was, I wouldn't use drugs. You don't know anything. If you were me. you would be like me too. Are you different? She's about to jump. This is the last shoot. There's no time. Do well, okay? Now start. 3, 2, 1... action. Repeat. 3, 2, 1... action. Why don't you jump? What can we do? Find a substitute. No. I'll see the schedule first. There's a time next week. Do you know how much one day costs here? That... Don't they look alike? Yes. Really troublesome for me. Are you coach? Maybe we should find a substitute. Be ready... 3, 2, 1... action. Cut! Okay! This part will use Lee Young's face. Very good. Thank you. The diving is great. Really? That's great. I'm forced to do that. Yes, just do it. Thank you. What is the woman's name? The substitute. Chu Sia. Chiang Chu Sia. Chiang Chu Sia, chu sia, good name too. How about diving with her? - I think she can. - Still need to practice together. Not easy. If it was someone else, I wouldn't say it. You must be fine. You can train her. Don't feel too risky? No risk. Think of it as a guarantee. (Jump once and...) (1, 2, 3... jump once) Why? Are you okay? Ready... Go. 1, 2, 3... Chu Sia, you are great. Really? You are great. Let's go. - That's really good. - I don't think so. When did you practice? At the age of 20, Lee Young couldn't do it. Is it possible... you saw ''chu wei long'' too? What? - What do you mean? - It's okay if you didn't. No need to be so sensitive. No, I never saw her. What's wrong with you? What, coach? Do you know what time it is? Go to the hospital. - Do therapy. You can start if you have healed.. - I am fine. I am fine. No, at that time, Soo Jin was like you too. If you do therapy, you won't be like this. Come out after packing. You feel that I am like her too? What? Yes, I don't dare jump. I'm useless. So, I am just like her. Hey, why do you say that? Choose what you love. We'll clean up the rest. And this... Why didn't the coach provide a letter of recommendation? I can take care of it myself. Why is it so troublesome? Learn the letter well. I'll give to them later. Make lunch with them. Sir, they have arrived. The traffic is really jammed. Lee Young, we have lunch together, right? That's great. You know them, right? They are jury this time. She still has to training. She should eat, right? Let Lee Young get to know them better. Why? Will our team be not qualified? - Not like that. - I'm Lee Young. Sir, where are we going? You said you want to go to Cen Tang. Why do we go this way? What? Of course this way. It feels wrong. We'll arrive there soon. What? Not looking for friend? Stop. Yes, it's better not to look for her. Stop! The national women's diving competition 2020 It looks very interesting. The diver of Korean pride, Lee Young. Yeah, I heard she got over it. Lee Young will head for the diving board. Lee Young. (Score: 7) Maybe she's nervous. Maybe her condition isn't good, looks not excited. (Lee Young) I hope you can be like me, even if only once. Her movement is less stable. (Score: 8) It's worse than I imagined. Yes. Hope she can be better. (The preliminaries is finished) (Lee Young still has to try hard) (There's still the next round) At that time, I was afraid of water. If your condition was like me, you would be like me too. Do you think you are different? Lee Young. Are you crazy? You can't be like this. This is not mine, This belongs to Soo Jin. Lee Young. What? Did you think that I used drugs before? Soo Jin used drugs. Is that important now? You said you are different from her. Look at you, what's different? Still not finished talking with you. - What's wrong? At that time, what exactly happened? - Enough! It's none of my business. My shoulder hurts a bit. I'll talk to her. Thank you Your problem with chu sia is the subject of conversation on internet. - They said you got high marks on purpose. - I'll be normal again. - It's not that easy. - I said I could. What? I said I could come back! Don't be like that. I'll drive. I said it's over. Come to your sense! Lee Young. Lee Young. - What's wrong with you? - That's enough. Did you think that I used drugs? Chu Sia can do it. Come to your sense! What were you talking to her about? Do you think you are different? Do you think you are different? Don't you already know everything? Lee Young. What are you doing? Get prepared quickly. Just now I heard your conversation with Chu Sia. Where are you going? Pretend not to know it. I hope to you. There's still time. Don't do it again. I will definitely help you, train again. Training? If I train again, I will die. Lee Young, I... I have been afraid of water since that incident. The drugs ease my fear. That's all. You don't need to take drugs. You can win. You don't know anything. If your situation was the same as mine... you would be like me too. Do you think you are different? Lee Young. What are you doing? Don't do that. I beg you, that's enough. At that time, about my mother, why did you tell me? I worried that... - you would regret. - Don't you want to do it? - What? - If not, why don't you ask me... why can I be so scared? You don't want to know at all? Hold on. We'll arrive at the hospital soon. If we weren't friends, it would be better. We want to see her. We just received her. It's hard to know her. It seems difficult to ascertain her identity, and the forensic results... Lee Young, take off the seat belt. Subtitle by Herry AM
