(thoughtful music) (silverware clinking) (woman moaning) - [Woman] Oh yes. (panting) - Sorry. Sorry. - It's my fault. - It isn't you. This keeps happening to me. - What is it? - I don't know. - I know what it is. It's me. You're not attracted to me anymore. - No, no, it's not that. It's just, that's not true and you know it. Just, it's not true. It's me, I just have a problem. I'm just going through a phase or something. - You have to tell him Norman. (gentle music) You know something? I've never once seen you cry. (thoughtful music) (motor rumbling) (brakes squealing and hissing) (banging) (whirring) (thunder rumbling) - [Woman] Tell me about it. They're right across the street from me. Rude is an understatement. - Norman and I woke up twice. - I almost called the police. - Can you believe the nerve of these people? I mean moving in in the middle of the night? - I couldn't get back to sleep. Shirl wants to know what time we're coming over tonight. (speaking in foreign language) - And please be on time. And make sure you tell the others. (speaking in foreign language) - Seven works. Hey, show me the twins real quick. - Now? - [Man] No Shirley, tomorrow. - Are you alone? - I'm in my office. The door's shut. - [Man] Everything seems to be in order. Please. Did you upgrade the filing system? - Sagging, uneven. But you couldn't do any better. Is this what I pay you for? Get to work dough boy. You just ruined my lunch. (happy music) - Hey George. - Hey man. - Hey. (woman groans) - Just calm down. - [Shirley] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Norm. - Hey Norm. - Hey. - Hey. - Nice to see you everyone. - Haven't seen you in two weeks, Norman. - How've you been? - Been great, thanks. - [Man] How are the flights? - Flights are smooth Frank, thank you. Smooth as glass. - How long you off for? - Two weeks. - Oo. Lucky you. - Eh, got some new neighbors, eh? - Yeah. Anybody met them? - No. - No. - [Frank] Nuh huh. - Haven't heard a peep out of 'em all day. - Yeah, wait 'til tonight. (laughing) - Eh. (tense music) - Howdy neighbor. - [Woman] Hi. - Hey, new guy. - That was rude. - [Shirley] A strange man. (chuckling) (thoughtful music) - So? When? You said you would today. - This weekend, I promise. - Tryouts are in a week! - Obert, you have a lesson tomorrow. - Come here sweetie. Give Mommy a kiss. Night. - Sweet dreams O. (alarm beeping) Maria. - What, what? What's wrong? - Look at that mess. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Stupid candles. All right, I'll just take the mask off myself. - No no, no no no, it's okay. I'll get it, I'll get it. (Norman grunts) (engine cranks) - Do you mind? - Hey buddy, it's two o'clock in the morning. Come on! - Do you mind? (thoughtful music) (doorbell rings) - So, is he ready today? - One, two. - Norman. - This isn't the best way. It's fear that's stopping him. - You're only scaring him more. - [Obert] I don't wanna swim. I wanna play baseball. - Hey Obe, please come outta there. - [Obert] I wanna play baseball! - I've never seen a fear of water this intense before. I'm not gonna be able to come anymore. I'm really sorry. - You know we can't force him. You're being too hard on the boy. Let's see how far you can throw. - Okay. (glass shatters) That's not my fault! (ominous tones) (thoughtful music) - Had an accident. It's... I'll pay for the window. Well it's nice to finally meet you. I'm Norman Slater. - Your boy plays ball, huh? - Yes, yes he does. His name's Obert. - Obert? - That's right, Obert. So what do you do? - Some call me a shrink. - Well, just so you know, We've got a thing called silence after seven in this neighborhood. Jenna, Jenna. You, Jenna, you and Obert play some catch. Hey kid, hey still. Don't be rude. Play some catch. - [Jenna] Kiss me. Kiss me or I'll hit you again. (upbeat music) - No I understand. - It's first come first served. Prices are non-negotiable. (group murmuring) - [Redhead] Wow, look at this TV. - Deal. - Sold. - Hello. - Hey. Do you have an Alex Rodriguez rookie mint condition? - No, can't say that I do. But I do have a Hank Aaron rookie mint condition. - Wow! Totally mint? How much? - It's pretty pricey. How much you got? - $2.79. - Did you count that earlier? - [Obert] No. (scoffs) - I'll make a deal with you. If there's exactly $2.79 there, the card is yours. I'll throw in the stethoscope for free. - Thanks. (growls) (woman laughing) - [Redhead] Mine. You can't have it, it's mine. - [Shrink] What's your name? - This is my old lady, Shirley. I'm George. George Adams. - Doctor Peoples. - Hey, this is new. Why are you selling all this stuff? - Well I'd rather not have it around. - Mom, look what I got for $2.79. - Let me see. What? I can't let you sell this to him for that much. - No, no no no, I have no use for them. They were, they were for my son. (speaking in foreign language) - Yes. So what was that look about? - What look? - The one with Peoples? - Oh please. - [Redhead] He's very intriguing. - [Maria] He's so sweet to Obert. Norman's jealous. (TV crackles) - Ugh, this TV doesn't work very well. - [Maria] Yeah, but it looks cool. - You're right. So, has Norman gotten it up yet? (laughing) - Tyne, come on. That's not nice. - You know he's probably gay. - Gimme a break. Norman isn't gay. (Tyne laughs) (tense music) (woman pants) - [Woman] Oh oh yes. Good, right there. (moaning) Oh right there. (moaning) (slap cracks) No, don't. No, no! No stop. - [Peoples] What, is this all about you? - [Woman] Please don't hit me. (slaps cracking) - [Peoples] Silence after seven. - [Woman] Please, no. No. (glass shatters) (eerie music) (phone rings) - Realtor at large, Frank speaking. - Yeah, it's me. - [Frank] Hey, what's up? - Are you alone? - Yeah, I'm on my way to the office. - All right, you're not gonna believe this. But I just saw Peoples put a body into his car. It looked like a dead woman. - Oh my god. - Yeah. He was trying to keep her covered with a sheet. She looked dead. - Norman, you're sure? - Yes, yes. - 'Cause last night I heard this woman have a big O in his basement. And right after he started hitting her. She was screaming, calling for help. I guess he beat her unconscious. - I guess he just kept on hitting. - [Frank] We should call the police. - [Norman] No, no not yet. No, I need to look into this more. You know we'll look like idiots. - [Frank] Holy shit, he just pulled up right next to me. - Look, are you sure? - Yeah, it's him. Wait a second. There's a woman in his front seat. She's not moving all right. - Well, well follow him Frank. Just let him get ahead of you. - He just got in the carpool lane. - [Norman] Just follow him! - I don't know about that. It's a $300 ticket. - Are ya kidding me, go! (tires peeling) (suspenseful music) Frank, what do you see? - [Frank] Just hold on. - [Norman] What do you see, what do you see? - [Frank] I don't see anything. - [Norman] Frank, Frank, Frank. - [Frank] Wait a sec. - What do ya see? - [Frank] A cop. I'm getting pulled over. 300 bucks man, I knew it. Shit. Norm what'd I just tell ya? - All right, you listen to me, Frank. You don't say a word. You got that? - I'll call ya back. (siren chirping) Shit! Come on Rocco, gimme a break. - Can't. Got these new video cameras installed. - Really? - Yeah. Cameras are always on. I caught you up the on ramp. - Well can't you just gimme a warning or something? - Not for driving alone in a carpool lane. I owe you one. - Great. - Could you draw a house for me? - I could. But I don't want to. - Well I'm afraid you have to. - What kinda house? - Draw a picture of your house. (thoughtful music) I'm afraid he's not letting out his anger as there's no chimney. The lack of a welcome mat indicates he does not let others in. Also I noticed there's no family activity in the front yard. The absence of windows. He's not willing to look outward. Note everything is in black. - Look, do you think you can rid the boy of his fear of water or not? - There is no guarantee. Hydrophobia is difficult to cure. - [Maria] But his nightmares about drowning are getting worse. - Listen, the best way to get him over his nightmares is to get him into the pool. Has Obert ever had a negative experience with water ever? Anything? - [Man] This is ridiculous. (glass shattering) - [Woman] No, no! - [Man] What a hypocrite. - [Woman] No! No! Stop. - [Man] Gimme a break. This is absurd. - Don't touch me. Let me go. - Peoples and that broad, they're fighting again. But she's there. Guess she's not dead. - She was definitely unconscious. - I bet he took her to the hospital. I think we should get Rocco involved. - No no, not yet. We need to look into this more, you and I. This guy's trouble. - I'm with you. - [Man] This is ridiculous. - Shh. (woman moaning) (dog panting) (energetic music) (car horn blaring) (tires peeling) - [Man] Move, move, you idiot. (man yelling) (car horn blaring) (gasps) - Hello. - Morning Maria. - Oh, let me help you with that. - No, let it harden first. It comes off easier that way. - Is it hard yet? You know we're all looking forward to meeting the missus. (unsettling music) (engine sputters) - Need a ride? - Actually I need a Mr. Fix-it. You handy with cars? - (scoffs) No. Just people. But I can give you a ride if you'd like. (engine sputters) (sighs) - I'm sorry if I said something to offend you earlier. - No, no no. It's fine, I overreacted. It was rude. It's just that the missus is dead. - I'm sorry. I heard that you lived with a woman and I, I assumed that she was your wife. - [Peoples] A brunette? - [Maria] Yeah. - Yeah. So many assumptions. That would be Molly. - She your girlfriend? - [Peoples] Having a party? - Yeah. It's my son's birthday. - I like your eyes. They are so big. And beautiful. (unsettling music) - [Obert] Hey Mom! - Hey Obi-wan. (chuckles) - So, what was that about? - Oh he was nice enough to give me a ride, actually. - Well where's your car? - It's at the candle store, it's broken down, it wouldn't start. Would you mind going to get it for me? Maybe some wires just came loose. I mean isn't that possible? - Mm, highly unlikely. You always keep that car unlocked. He probably just popped the hood. - Oh gimme a break. - As if his night antics weren't enough. Frank and I heard him beating a woman. - Come again? - A woman. Keeps her trapped in his basement. - How do you know this? - Both Frank and I heard it. - If you know this for a fact, Norman, just call the police. - Well, we're looking into it more first. I'm not making this up. This is serious. - And so is your imagination. You know you're always one for a conspiracy. Doctor Peoples is a nice man. - To you, maybe. - Do I sense a little jealousy here? (scoffs) Actually I'm flattered. Can we just try to have a good time today? Please? - This house is gonna be a real mess. We're gonna have to steam clean again. (guests murmuring) - [Jenna] Where's Eddie? - He got sick. His mom wouldn't let him come over. It's all right. - All of Obe's friends canceled. - I'm so sorry. (doorbell rings) - Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. - Come on in, thank you. - Happy birthday Obert. - [Obert] Thanks. - Hi Norm. - Hi. - Hey everyone. - Hi Obert. Where are your friends? - Eddie's sick and everyone thought he was coming and didn't wanna get sick. So they're not coming. (phone rings) - Yeah, Frank speaking. Realtor at large. Yeah, yeah I'm in man. Come on. Let me call you back. - That's exactly why I left you. (scoffs) You're gonna gamble your life away. - I'm not gambling, will ya? - So, anyone care for a drink? - We don't drink. - We do. Come on, let's go. - I'm serious. He was beating her and then screwing her within seconds. - [Frank] And it's happened more than once. - Guy's got a child's coffin in his house. - Norman, how many times have you seen UFOs while flying? - Yeah I'm not the only pilot to see the lights, my friend. - Seems you're trying to find something wrong with these people. - No way George. I saw that weird stuff at the garage sale. - You mean the stuff that we all bought? (horn blares) - [Peoples] Hello. - Hi. - Hey Doc, come on in. - Hey, happy birthday Obert. - Wow, thanks. - Did you invite him? - No. - Then why is he here? - [Maria] I don't know. - [Obert] How'd you know it was my birthday? - Your mother told me. - Oh wow. Dad a new mitt. - [Norman] Well, now that is nice of you, Doctor Peoples. - Oh it was a pleasure. - Why don't you come on in? Can I get you something to drink or? - Would you like a hat? - Thank you. - Let me see. - Cookie? - Oh thank you. - Would you like something to drink? (suspenseful music) - It seems you're a well read man, Norman. I notice the section on conspiracy works. Are you a theorist? - No, I just seek the truth. (laughs) What's the truth about the woman you put into the car the other morning? She looked hurt. - I saw her in your car as well. - Cake is served, gentlemen. - Great, I'm starving. - [Norman] We can't let him weasel his way out of it like that. He's torturing that woman in his basement. Somebody's gotta confront him. - Since Shirl's been on her meds, she's like a different person. It's wonderful. Right sweetie? - I believe medication is overprescribed. Sure it's necessary in a few extreme bipolar and manic cases, but it seems to have become a Band-Aid for the general public. I'm working with patients with an alternative and interactive treatment. No medication whatsoever. I believe this could become the future of psychiatry. - Wow. - Interesting. - So what's it like, being a shrink? - (scoffs) Well, I'm helping people to look inward and to see the light is something that I find very rewarding. Actually I love it. - Did you hear that Norm? He's seen the light. - Yes, but ever so often you encounter a patient that's unable to be cured. Usually because of some form of denial. - So who's the brunette? (Maria exclaims) - I'm sorry. Let me help you. Uh. I'm sorry. - I should go change. Obert. Hey, happy birthday, huh? - Thanks. - You got your mother's eyes kid. (pensive music) - [Man] I can't believe this. - [Woman] I'll be good, I won't do it again. - [Peoples] Dammit I've had enough of this. You're gonna stop it. - [Woman] Just let go of me. (door slams) (dramatic music) (pounding at door) - I hear ya. Okay! It's two o'clock in the morning. Is there a problem? - I need to borrow a cup of sugar. - Get outta here. Leave asshole! - George, calm down. Doc, please leave Doctor. - Now! - Would you mind lending me a cup of sugar first? Ouch. - Son of a bitch. You want some of me? Hmm? - Just a cup of sugar. - You want some of this? - [Peoples] Just a cup of sugar. - You're really making a name for yourself. - George! George. George, don't. - I'll teach you to mess with George Adams. - Look, just forget about it, all right? Do not come on my property. You wouldn't hit a surrendering man would you? (punch thuds) - George stop it. Stop. Please stop. (punch thuds) No. - It's called self defense. Now he attacked me on my property. (sirens chirping) - All right, can everybody please calm down. Everybody back up. Everybody please back up. - [Policeman] You have the right to remain silent. Will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have an attorney present before questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will appointed for you. - Honey I am so sorry about what I did. Really, I am. - Um hm. - He must be doing this to you for some reason. He must have some motive. - What? Money? - Could be. - [Frank] George. I talked to a friend in the department. Neil Rocco. - The friend that gave ya a ticket? - Well he owes me one. He's looking into your case. He's checking Peoples out. - Just stay out of it. This is my business. (thoughtful music) - What's that lovely aroma? - [Maria] Cookies. - Any special occasion? - Not really. - Have we found a new swimming instructor yet? - Nope. - You gotta keep your eye on the ball. Can you do me a favor? But you gotta keep it a secret. - Cool. - Cool. Cool. - This guy, Peoples was a psychiatrist. Graduated top of his class, Harvard Med School. Lost his license in '95 for patient involvement and unconventional practice. - Oh but he still calls himself Doctor Peoples. - Yeah, well in the same year he changed his name legally from Avery Peoples to Doctor Peoples, first name spelled D-O-C-T-O-R. - [Both] What? - Bizarre right? Every few years he tries to get his license reinstated claiming that he's discovered some new method of practice. But he always gets turned down. When his parents died he inherited a couple mil from them. He's got no police record. Although his driver's license was suspended once. For driving alone in the carpool lane. Three tickets in one month. In '95 his wife died giving birth in one of those New Age water birth clinics. But the death certificate is missing. Now, sometimes D.C.s get misplaced or in the wrong file. But it's not common. The baby lived, but it wasn't raised by Peoples. Peoples sounds fishy. It's a little premature for a search though. You gotta show just cause, proof. Keep an eye on him. Get a video camera. - [Norman] You're absolutely sure she went into his house? - [Obert] Yes, I already told you. - [Norman] And how long was she in there for? - A long time 'cause I fell asleep. - Thanks Obe, it's good. Remember that spying is our little secret. Right? - I like spying. It's funner than hide and seek. Who's he? - Well Obert I won't want to upset you or anything, but just want you to meet a new friend. - Is he another doctor? - He's different. He works with children but he plays sports with them. - Dad, this sucks. - Ah come on, you'll have fun. - [Doctor] Okay, your house is very interesting. You only use black ink? - Black is all colors combined. Now, about your house. I'm afraid you're not letting out your anger as there is no chimney. No welcome mat indicates you do not let others in. And your absence of windows means you're not willing to look outward. - All right, all right. You've done this before. - Did you take your medication? - Yes of course. - Don't even tell me you're playing peep show again with the crazy dog of a wife. - I'm on my lunch hour. - Like you need lunch. I need these files checked by six. Oh, are you getting mad, George? What are you gonna do about it? (thoughtful music) - Tell me, what should I do? - I'm sorry. I shoulda told ya. We'll go to the batting cage tomorrow. Don't be upset. Got a surprise for you waiting back at the house. (gasps) Hello Spotty. (phone rings) Good evening. Gotcha. Gotta go piddle. Gotta take, what did you decide on anyway? - Hawkeye. - Ah, Hawkeye. (ominous music) - [Maria] So... I've never done this before. Ever. But it feels so good to be wanted by you. (speaking in foreign language) - She said you make me feel sexy. (speaking in foreign language) That's Maria. She used to say that to me. (Maria speaking in foreign language) (tense music) (engine cranks) Hey, hey, stop. You stop. You stop! Stop. Maria, get outta there. - May I help you? - [Frank] What the hell is this? - A decoy, for the carpool lane, you know what I mean, Frank? - Where's my wife? - Are you serious? - Where is she? - You are blind. Turn around. - What's going on? - [Frank] I'm gonna split Norm. - [Norman] Ah, I'll pick him up later. - What do you mean you'll pick him up later? Whose is he? - [Norman] It's Obert's. - Obert, honey we can't. - Do not try to turn this around, okay? Where were you? - Tyne's. - Bullshit. I'm gonna ask you again, where were you? - I just told you. Norman, what's wrong with you? - So'd you get a chance to meet People's abused girlfriend, huh? - No. - Why? You were inside the house, weren't ya? - I baked him cookies. - What? How, how could you bake him cookies after what he did to George? - I just, it was a peace off-- - I heard you in there tonight. (tense music) Thanks for meeting me. - No problem, what's up? - I just wanna make sure I'm not all caught up in my own head. Last night the woman we heard in his basement was Maria, right? - Definitely. - What is this? I can't believe she's doing this. You know he's got no trespassing signs in his yard now. - Yeah I know, I saw that. - I have an idea. And I need your help though. - What is it? - It'll expose him. Catch him and Maria in the act. - Or free that woman he's been terrorizing. - [Norman] And it'll get George off the hook. - You know she's gonna get half unless you can prove infidelity. - We will. (tense, energetic music) (static buzzing) (thoughtful music) (silverware clinking) (phone rings) - I'll get it. - I'll get it. Hello? Oh that's terrible. Well I wish I could, but I've taken these last two weeks off because my son has Little League. Yes sir. Um hmm. Yes, I'll fly out tomorrow. - Work? - Two pilots became ill. And all these flights have come up that they need me to take. I have to go. - But you said you'd take me to tryouts. - Look, don't worry. You'll do well. (pensive music) (George muttering) - Yeah honey, bye. - [Frank] Tyne leaves me, but moves across the street. I know two things: sports and women. She's definitely coming back to me. - Yeah. Listen, Frank. Tyne is filing for divorce. - No way, she is too into me, Norm. What? - Frank, I'm absolutely serious. She's told Maria. - She wouldn't do that. She loves, she loves me. I'm not gonna let that happen. (phone rings) I bet you money that's her. Hello, it's Frank. I know. I know, I'm working on it, okay? I gotta split. - (mutters) Wait Frank. Frank wait a second. Wait. Is there a problem? (ominous music) - [Peoples] Okay, now squeeze it a little tighter, son, okay? - [Obert] Like this? - [Peoples] Right. Now ready, swing. - Hey, that's great. - All right, slugger. - [Maria] Honey that's awesome. - It is. - Did you guys wanna come inside for a little bit? - Sure. - Dr. Peoples? - [Peoples] Anyone game for a swim? - [Frank] I think he's trying to get them into your pool. - Okay, I'll check it out. - I see a man beating a woman in the face and back. - Excuse me? - No blood though, bruises come later. - What about this? What do you see here? - (giggles) Gross. That's two grown women touching each other's privates. - And this? - That's me being punched and kissed. (buzzing) Guess time's up. - He's extremely disturbed. - I beg your pardon? - I feel Obert needs to be enrolled in our outpatient program. - This is a little extreme, don't you think, I mean-- - We already ran your insurance. Your out of pocket co-pay is only $500 a month. - Oh, only. - What matters now is Obert. - Well yeah. - He's sick and he needs help. I have an obligation to the state to report potential child abuse in the home. - Wait a minute, wait a min, what are you saying? - Obert took a standard raw shock test indicating he's exposed to some type of sexual or physical abuse. - In my home? That's absurd. - You can voluntarily enroll Obert in our outpatient program. - No wait a minute. We are good people. Obert is a good boy. - If you choose not to you should know I have a right to Baker Act him. - What's a Baker Act? - Baker Act is a 72 hour time period where a doctor can legally admit a patient for observation and testing. - Perhaps we could try the outpatient. I would just need to discuss this with my husband. - [Doctor] I think that would be a good idea. (sad music) - [Peoples] Excuse me, Frank. - What do you want? - Well this was in my mailbox, but it's addressed to you. If you'd like to talk. - It's junk mail. I got stuff to do man. - Frank, I've been watching you watching me. (whistling) - What happened to you? - I fell. - Where, when? - Listen I don't wanna get into it. I have to clean this room up. I need to sell the house as soon as possible. Gimme a hand will ya? - Frank, what's going on? We just set the stop. (tense frenzied music) - Obe honey, Obe. Obe? Come on honey. Obe! Obe! Obe! - So what, the house is taken care of. I don't care, we're even now. No I will not accept no, I won one. You hear me, won. - What's going on Frank? - I'll talk to you later. It's a personal matter. - Well hold on. - No, I gotta run man. - Hey Frank, wait! (phone beeping) Hello? - Where are you? - [Norman] Sacramento on a layover. What's wrong? - Obert's missing. - What? - He's gone. He just, he ran away from the doctor's office. - Did you check the house? - Of course. - Have you looked in the neighborhood? - Yes! I looked everywhere. - Okay let's just calm down and listen don't do-- - I already called the police. Please come home. Norman, I need you to come home now. Please. - I was working the last two days. - Will they verify this? - Yes. I cannot believe this. We're being treated like criminals here. - Potential child abuse is always reported by medical professionals. - This is wasting precious time. - No one's saying you've done anything. I am saying that a well respected psychiatric facility reported potential abuse to your son and then he just disappeared. - He ran away. - Listen, Obert has issues. We know this. But he is not an abused child. He ran away or... Is with that man across the street, Doctor Peoples. - Go on. - Frank, our neighbor, heard a kid inside Peoples 'house last night. Peoples has no children. - Norman, correct me if I'm wrong. But aren't you required to maintain a certain groomed appearance when flying? What exactly did you hear going on in his house last night? A woman crying. And I heard sex and violence in the past. - No, specifically last night. What did you hear. - I told you. - A woman? - Crying. - That's it? Just a woman. - Yeah. - Thank you for your time. - You need to check out Doctor Peoples. - My god Norman, please. - Mr. Slater, we cannot enter his house without a warrant. And a judge will not issue us one because you are lying. - What, that is preposterous. Every second counts here. - If I were you I wouldn't say anything else. - What? - Shut your mouth. Sit down. But please don't leave the city limits, Mr. Slater. - Excuse me? - I suggest that you call your attorney. And we have an APB out on Obert. You continue looking around and pass out some of those fliers. - Oh we will. - I will. (tense music) (static buzzing) - [Peoples] What do you see? There you go. Yeah, yeah, good. Good, good. (laughing) There you go. No, no, no! (clattering) (phone beeping) (door slams) - [Maria] No! - [Frank] Go, go, go, go. Where'd they go? (heartbeat thumping) (panting) - [Maria] Oh my god, (speaking in foreign language) - Obert. - [Maria] Obe. (speaking in foreign language) - Obert. Maria? (ambulance beeping) Come on, this way. They're outside the front door. - [Man] Get the oxygen on him right away. - [Man] Now, come on. Move, move. Let's go, get outta here. Come on. (siren blares) - [Frank] Let's go, come on. - [Woman On P.A.] Doctor Green Neil to the maternity ward. Doctor Green Neil to maternity. (sobbing) (gasps) - Mother fucker. (punch thuds) - [Frank] Norm get back. Stop. - Security. - Norman! Stop it. (punch thuds) Stop it Norman. - Security! - Come on. Come on. - ICU. - Oh my god. - ICU. - [Man] Out of the area. Please secure the hallway. (man yelling) - [Man] Stop. - [Man] All right everybody clear out the way. (Norman growls) (Peoples sighs) (machines beeping) (sad music) - [Man] How you doing, buddy? - How's Obe? - [Man] They're still in ICU. Said he was playing hide and seek. What do you want first? Good news or the bad news? - Bad? - Maria says that she saw Doctor Peoples take Obert out of the pool. - Oh that's, well, the question is who put him in the pool? - Detectives wanna talk to ya about child abuse. - Yeah. I know what's going on. Peoples and Maria are setting me up. They're having an affair. - [Man] You have any proof of that? - No, not yet. - We would need it. The police are saying that you lied about being at work before Obert's disappearance. An injunction's in place against ya to stay 500 feet away from Obert. And Maria's also placed a restraining order against you. You're gonna need to stay away from her as well. - Well why, I mean it's not like I'm gonna be breaking outta here. - All right, now for the good news. Somebody posted your bail. $250,000. - Who? - Anonymous. Norman. You go anywhere near that hospital or your home, you're gonna be arrested. You're gonna be released tomorrow at six. Do not go home. (tense music) (rumbling) - Yes. Yeah, it's 0067. It's my cell. Could you have her call me ASAP? - [Announcer] And now the Royals bring the ball the other direction. They've reeled off the last six points and we're under 16 minutes to play (door slams) here in regulation. - Fucking freaked me out man. Come on, let's go! But the ball in the hole. (phone rings) Yeah? I want it, I'm in. - You're gambling again. - No. - Did you bail me outta jail? - No. Norman you can't be here, okay? You gotta leave. I had to put the house in escrow. I emptied the whole spare room. - [Announcer] And he's got the ball, pushes inside against Arnie Rise and shoots! (tense music) - Oh my god. Someone else did this. What? - Are you in on this with them? - No way Norm. I swear to God on my life. I took this stuff down yesterday. Someone else has been in here. - Are you lying to me Frank? - No, I swear to God. - Then why are you so intent on selling this place? - You want the truth? - No, lie to me, please. - The truth is I've been gambling. - You said you were gonna stop gambling. - I lied. I was up 250,000 bucks man. And I dropped 500. So I sold the house. Check this out. I've got 10 points on the max. This time it's different. This time I'm betting big, I'm betting smart and I bet one million dollars. - Some games are fixed, Frank. - That's ridiculous. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Maria] A nurse said you called. - That's right. How is he? - [Maria] He's sleeping. And he's gonna be fine. (sighs) (unsettling music) - [Frank] Hear anything? - No. - [Announcer] But I'm tellin' ya, these pesky little Commodores-- - Two points. I need 10 points man. - [Woman] What are you saying, Doctor Peoples? - [Peoples] Listen to me. When people have a superior person or action hanging over their heads, 99.9% of the time their actions are not organic, but influenced by the governing party. Do you know what you have to do? - [Woman] Yes. - [Peoples] Do you? - Norman, what are you doing here? - Let me in. - You're risking your ass. - Shirley went over to Peoples' house earlier. I heard her go into his house. - [George] She's been here all day. - Uh uh. Have you been here all day? - Yeah. I went to the store for a little bit. - When? - About an hour ago. - That's when she went. - [George] No, she didn't. - Bullshit. Are you two people doing something with this man? - No. We're not. There's no conspiracy here. My life doesn't have anything to do with you. You stay out. It's none of your business. - This man is trying to destroy our life. It is my business. He's keeping his wife, who is not dead, in the basement. And he's trying to screw our wives. - Get out! - He tried to kill Obe. He tried to-- (thudding) (grunting) He's a psychopath. - Look at yourself. Who's the psychopath? (buzzing) (thoughtful music) - [Man] Is it? Well that's different. No, no, no. - [Woman] Stop squeaking over there. (woman screams) - [Tyne] Has Norman gotten it up yet? (laughing) (man yelling) (man laughing) - [Man] You better stop it. - [Woman] What do I do? Tell me. - [Peoples] Since when is it all about you? - [Woman] You have no idea. - [Woman] What should I do? - [Woman] Oh please. - [Man] Shut up. - [Man] Smoke in here. - [Woman] What am I doing? - [Man] That's good. (laughing) - [George] Really a screwed up woman. (laughing) (laughing) - [Announcer] They sure have turned things around and are on a run. 80-78 is our score. And now the Devils within strike. - [Frank] Pass it, pass it. There it is, there's a shot. Take the shot, take the shot. Good defense. Nice steal, go! Take it to the hole. He's open. Shots, nice. Two points, let's go. - [Announcer] To three zone. - Good pass. Come on, work it around. - [Announcer] Mccavry with the ball. He's dribbling over the right side. He gives it to Jones. - Better keep on there. - [Announcer] Puts one up from three! - Three, three, yes! - [Announcer] Oh, but they're only gonna count it as two. - No! That was a three point shot. It wasn't near the line. - Well, it's nice to see you. - Frank, Frank, Frank, come here. - [Announcer] We'll look at it on the video tape. Holy smokes, he was at least - [Norman] Frank upstairs. - [Announcer] Six inches behind the line. But it will only count as two. - This game's fixed. - Frank, come here now! Listen, listen, listen, listen. - [Maria] Your eyes are so sexy. - [Peoples] You're so naughty. - [Maria] They devour me. - He's got some nerve. - [Maria] Do you wanna touch me? - [Tyne] Norman is clueless. - [Maria] Well he suspects something, but it's not like he can prove it. Don't look at me like that. You know what it does to me. - [Peoples] Patience my patients. - [Maria] Do you know how sexy you are? - [Tyne] That's how I make you feel good. - That's my wife. - [Peoples] Girls, girls. - That's my wife! (women sighing) (suspenseful music) (moaning) - I think I'm in love with you. - I don't wanna give you the wrong impression. I love Norman. - You know you're really a screwed up woman. - [Shirley] Your boss is dirty. - [George] Shut up. - [Shirley] Why don't you be a man and stand up to him. (Shirley gasping) - [George] Shut up! (slap cracks) (Shirley exclaims) I'm gonna watch what I want. Huh? What are you gonna do about it? Hmm? (glass shatters) - Good. - [Shirley] 911. - Good for you. - My husband just assaulted me. Yes. (woman exclaiming) Thank you. (grunting) - [Man] Oh god. Oh god. - Oh god! (grunting) - [Rocco] This guy Peoples was a psychiatrist. He lost his license for patient involvement and unconventional practice. You saw that weird stuff at the garage sale. (Shirley screams) (slap cracks) - [Man] Silence after seven. - [Peoples] Patience my patients. - [George] You mean the stuff that we all bought? - [Peoples] I'm working with patients with an alternative interactive treatment. - Not what you think, huh? (Norman yells) (panting) - We are not your patients. - Yes you are. - I could have you arrested for this. - I could have you arrested for just being here. But why would I do that when I'm the one who bailed you out? - Why are you doing this? - Every day of my life I regret giving up my child for adoption. I can't change that. - [Rocco] His wife died, the baby lived. Peoples didn't raise him. The death certificate is missing. - [Peoples] You are blind. - [Rocco] Everyone in his family '95 birth, in '95, New Age water birth clinic. - But I can help that child by helping those around him to change for the better. Looking inward leads people to the light. You've been looking inward recently. What do you see? Obe's not the one with the problem. The problem lies in those affecting him. But all problems are meant to be solved. He needs love. He needs, he needs a father. He needs you. (suspenseful music) (gunfire pops) - Obe? (tense music) Obe? Son? (gunfire popping) - I'm adopted? How come you never told me? (panting) (gentle music) - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I thought that knowing would take something away. - You've got your mother's eyes, your mother's eyes, you've got your mother's eyes (sighs) - [Announcer] The underdogs have done the impossible. The odds makers in Vegas way off on this game. Or maybe it was just the referees who were just off with their calls. (plaintive piano music) (hopeful music) - Dad, I want a fan. - Dad I want... (Norman exclaims) (laughing) - Not as good as your moms. - Here. (Norman exclaims) (cheering) - Okay, you got it. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh! (sighs) Keep it low Obe, keep it low. (pensive music)
