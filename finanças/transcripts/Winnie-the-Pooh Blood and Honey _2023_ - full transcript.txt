[NARRATOR]: Deep in the 100 Acre Woods a young boy named Christopher Robin came across some most unusual adolescent creatures... cross-breeds who some would describe as abominations. The creatures introduced themselves as Owl, Rabbit Eeyore, Piglet and most importantly, Winnie-the-Pooh. With the naivete of youth, Christopher ignored the dangers and befriended them all. He brought them food, and with each passing day together their bond strengthened and grew. The days turned to years and with the years came maturity. Eventually, Christopher had to make the hard decision to leave his friends to attend college to become a doctor requiring them to fend for themselves once more. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Then, winter arrived. The nights were deathly cold the land barren and completely devoid of food. One fateful night, on the brink of starvation Pooh decided that in order to survive the group must consume one of their dearest friends. And thus, Eeyore was no more. The trauma of this act warped the minds of the group. They became feral and developed a hatred to all things human and in particular, Christopher Robin for abandoning them. A pact was made. They renounced their humanity and returned to their animalistic roots... swearing never to talk again. Here we are. Told you it wouldn't take that long. Come on, I know exactly where to go now. You said that two hours ago. Nearly there, promise. OK, one more hour. - One more hour. If not, we're turning back. - OK. You know, you're the first person I ever shown this place to. Oh. And why am I so special? Why are you so special? - Hmm? Oh, well, that is because soon we'll be Christopher and Mary Robin. I don't want any secrets between us. And I certainly don't want you to think I'm crazy. I don't think you're crazy, Chris. OK. Come on. [SHE HUMS A TUNE] Do you think I made up those stories? No, I don't think you've made it all up. OK, so you believe me? You believe they exist? Well, I didn't say that. Look... I think you were very young and your imagination ran wild and over the years, you've convinced yourself of them. They exist, Mary. I couldn't have made all this up. You don't need to be ashamed of that. Lots of people have imaginary friends as children. They're not imaginary, Mary. That strong imagination of yours is what's made you so successful. You don't need to shy away from it. Why are we even here? Hm? Why are we even here if you don't believe me? Chris... I don't think we're going to find them. But I'm here to support you. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Come on, it's starting to get a bit late. Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore... all of them we were friends for many years and... and they're out there. I know, you've told me the stories many times how you would sneak into the kitchen to get them food and how you would play with them for hours and talk to them. Yes. This little yellow bear... this baby pig... that no one, Chris, not even you has ever seen since. Maybe you're right. I know, I know it's quite hard to deal with this but that's why I came. You know, in a way, they still exist in you. [DISTANT ANIMAL CRY] Pooh! Come on, Mary, it's them! It's them! Christopher! - Pooh! Christopher, it's not safe! This is it. This is it, Mary, we found them. Christopher, we can't go in there. [THUNDER RUMBLES] This is the place, Mary, but it's changed. It can't be. It's barely how I remember it. [MARY]: This has to be some sort of mistake. [CHRISTOPHER]: Oh... Pooh. What happened to you after all these years? Christopher! We need to leave, now. Mary... - We really shouldn't be here. Mary, I really need to find out what's happened here, OK? Come on. Please? Look, you're not in any danger, OK? I know them. Alright? Look, I'm here to protect you. It's going to be OK, alright? I really don't like this. Mary, it's going to be OK. Alright, I promise. When you see them, it'll be fine. Come on. This is our house, Mary. We used to... we used to play here all the time. It's much bigger than I remember. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Pooh? Piglet? Chris? Is that you? Yes... but why is it like that? Why would they do this? I don't know. But this is not safe. We're going home. [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] - [SHE GASPS] We have to hide. We have to hide. Hide! Chris, hide! [DOOR CREAKS] [NEARBY CREAK] [FAINT SNORING] [SNORING CONTINUES] [SNORING CONTINUES] [BIRD WARBLES] Hide...

Why are you doing this, Pooh? We used to be friends. Why are you doing this, please? Piglet, I'm so sorry. I didn't know any of this would happen. I thought you'd be OK without me. Why are you doing this? We used to be friends. Stop. Please. I beg you. I would've never left, I swear. I swear. I... We used to play together as friends. Remember when we were younger, Pooh, we would play... Why, why are you doing this? I would've never left, I swear! I swear! Remember when we were younger, Pooh? Please... Stop. Stop. Stop, Pooh...

Then one night... I was asleep in my room, alone. Must've been like, 3am. [DOOR CREAKS] I just heard this noise in the room. He was inside... trying to undress me.
