(adventurous music) - [Narrator] From 1853 to 1929 over 150,000 homeless orphans were sent west to new homes and new lives on "Orphan Trains." (people singing in background) - Yeah. I know it's a cold night to have to make a buck. Probably like a lump of sugar or somethin'. Hey, Charlie. You gotta start taking better care of old Susie here. Back to work, old girl. Good evening. (people singing in background) (door slamming) (horse hooves clomping) (man laughing) (people singing in background) (man humming) (people singing in background) (train horn whistling) Evening, mister. Got the time? - Let me pass. - But really, sir. I gotta know the time. - All right. Time is for god's sake. Oh! Ah! - [Billy] Danny! Danny! Hold his arm. - Help! - [Billy] Hurry up, get his wallet! - Hold 'em! - Please, help! - [Billy] Bite 'em! - The cops, Billy! - [Billy] I got his watch, let's go. - [Man] Ah! (police whistle chirping) (upbeat acoustic music) (water splashing) (barrels thudding) - [Policeman] Hey. Come on here. Get down! All right. (upbeat acoustic music) (music box chiming) (door clicking) (clock ticking) (clock chimes ringing) - Put that back and sit down. (box lid slamming) I am the assistant commissioner for juvenile corrections. Sit up straight. Your mother died five years ago? Where's your father? - [Billy] Don't know. - Mmm-hmm. Where do you live? - [Billy] Don't live nowhere. - Uh-huh. Shoplifting, pickpocket, burglary, assault, escape from the almshouse. Eight convictions in three years. You've been a busy little boy, haven't you? - [Billy] I didn't do any- - Shut up. Your sentence is up tomorrow. After which you are to be taken back to the almshouse which is where you belong. But some reformers at the Children's Aid Society have other ideas. They've been taking certain orphans and sending them out West, placing them with families. Usually farmers. They've convinced the court it would be rehabilitative for you to have this chance. The court cannot force you to accept foster care out of its jurisdiction. There's a train leaving tomorrow. I want your decision now. - Is Danny going? - He is. (train horn whistling) (upbeat acoustic music) (train horn whistling) - Children are well-disciplined and possess of pleasant personalities. - We can always use an extra pair of hands. - Should the trial period prove unsatisfactory, arrangements can be made to return the child to the appropriate agent. - No, my farm's doing well enough. We can feed one more. - Not me. I hear they're all big city riffraff that'll steal you blind if you let 'em. Those kids will never fit in here. (man laughing) What about you, Anderson? You gonna die in the traces tryin' to make somethin' out of that homestead with only your misses and one young'un. Here's your chance for some free labor. - Our homestead provides. I think free labor is not a good reason to take one of these children. (train horn whistling) - Oh, there she is. (train horn whistling) - Where's that team of belles into yours, Anderson? You savin' 'em for the horse draw next month? (man chuckling) I got $10 says they can't out pull my purchase. - It would be a shame to take your money, Mr. Slater. Hah! - Make it 20! (train horn whistling) (horse whinnying) (train horn whistling) (railroad bells clanging) - Good riddance to ya. Try to pick my pocket, indeed. - Keep your hands off me. - Do you have your bags? Coming along, children. Come along, step lively. Just line up down there. Yes, can you manage? My name is Hill and this is Mr. Dobbins. We represent the Children's Aid Society and are looking for good homes for these unfortunate youngsters. In committing to provide a home, you must agree to educate them at least four months a year, to provide religious training, and to treat them in every way as members of your own family. I will now introduce the children. This young man with all the freckles is named Warren. He is 10 years old. And here we have a sturdy lad whose name is Matthew. He is also 10. This is Anna. She is eight years old. Here we have Danny. He is 12. And this is Billy, who is 13 years old. Ladies and gentlemen, you have met the children. It is time now to step forward and make your selections. (crowd murmuring) - You want to come home with me, son? - You look fit enough. Little hard work shouldn't do you any harm. - Would you like to be my little girl? - [Mrs. Johansson] What is your name? - Danny. - Oh, we live on a farm. Would you like to come live with us? - Um, eh. I guess I'm leavin', Billy. Got it off the conductor. - [Mr. Johansson] Danny? - Billy? Is that your name? (gentle acoustic music) Whoa. Did you do your chores? Christina, Olaf, this is Billy. He's from the orphan train. He will be living with us. Olaf, show Billy the pump so he can wash for dinner. (speaking in foreign language) - No one wanted him? - Yeah. - But Nils, is it wise? Hmm? We do not know anything about him. I thought we had agreed not to take one of these children. - What would you have me do? It's our Christian duty. We will try it. - I'll set another place. - Are you really an orphan? - Never seen one before, huh? What'd you expect? That I'd have horns and a tail? - Where'd you come from? - New York. - I was there once when we came on the ship from Sweden. But I don't remember. - [Christina] Olaf! - We must go in now. Wanna see my calf after supper? - Heavenly Father, we are truly grateful for your bounty. We ask your forgiveness for our sins and your blessings on all in this house. In the name of your dear son Jesus. Amen. - Amen. - What was it like on the train? Was there a lot of other kids? I rode on the train once. Didn't I, Mommy? Did you also- - Olaf, Billy has had a long journey. You eat your supper. (gentle acoustic music) (calf mooing) - She likes you. Sometimes she's afraid of people. - Do you have any brothers or sisters? - I had a brother. Christian. He died years ago. He was almost 19. You wanna see the hay mound? - [Billy] The what? - Come on. (bright acoustic music) Watch this. (bright acoustic music) (hay rustling) Now you. (bright acoustic music) (hay rustling) - [Billy] Yahoo! - [Olaf] Now. (bright acoustic music) Ah! - Yahoo! Geez. This is a big barn. - Papa and Christian built this barn and our house. We had just moved in when my brother and I came down with typhoid. I got well, but Christian didn't. Come on, I'll show you Freya and Twoson. - Who? (horse whinnying) Wow! These are the biggest horses I ever saw! - Freya has over 18 hands. Twoson's a little smaller. They're the best team in this part of the state. You wanna feed 'em? - Yeah. What kind of names are those? - Swedish. Freya's a girl's name. Twoson's the name of some goddess. - Who named 'em? - Christian. They were his horses. (owl hooting) (crickets chirping) - What do you do livin' out here in the middle of nowhere? - There aren't many kids to play with, unless we go to town and visit after church. Sometimes I get awful lonely, but there's lots to do. You'll see. (owl hooting) (crickets chirping) - Billy. Time for milking. Billy. Billy. Time for milking. - Oh, it's the middle of the night. - Yeah. (rooster crowing) (chicken clucking) (bright acoustic music) (cow mooing) (bright acoustic music) (chicken clucking) (ax thumping) (bright acoustic music) (axes thumping) (water splashing) On your feet! On your feet! My son and I built this barn with our own hands, and you would burn it down for a smoke? - Next time I'll smoke outside, for cryin' out loud! - Yeah, sure you'll start a fire in the prairie and burn down the house. Obey the rules and you can live here. Disobey, you go back where you came from. You understand? Do you understand? - Yeah, I understand. I understand this whole thing isn't gonna work! - Change the bedding for the calves. Make sure the mare and foal get plenty of water. - Might as well call it off. I don't belong here. I'm not gonna spend my days digging holes in the ground and scooping up manure when the animals are just gonna do it all over again tomorrow. - Make sure the mare and foal get plenty of water. Yah? - Yah! (rake thudding) (owl hooting) (Billy sighing) (footsteps clomping) - What's going on? - [Christina] Oh, good morning. - Why didn't you wake me up? - Nils and Olaf are doing the chores. We thought you would use the sleep. Work is hard here if you're not used to it. - What a shame. There's nothin' I like better than being woken up in the middle of the night and someone saying, "Time for milking, time for milking." (Mother chuckling) - I have biscuits, plum jam, and the buttermilk for breakfast. You're going to need some new clothes if you're going to live on a farm. Let's see how this shirt fits you, huh? You've got broad shoulders. Hold out your arm, lift it up. Higher. Higher. I'm trying to fit you so. You, ah-ah-ah. Sit there, ya. Take a little in at the back. It'll fit you fine. I have some trousers for you to try on later, too. But you must go to town with Nils this morning. You'll need other things. You must have a good pair of boots. Those shoes won't last another week. Billy? Do you have any memory of your family? - Just my mother. She's the only family I ever had. But she died of the consumption when I was seven. - I'm very sorry. - How far is it to town? - [Christina] Oh, about eight miles. - And the one after that? - The next town? Oh, that's Highland Center, it's about another 10 miles, but that's not a real town. It's more like a railroad camp. The next real town is Central City, and that's almost 40 miles. - Thanks for the biscuits. They were good. (acoustic music) (wagons rumbling) - Whoa. Billy. (door slamming) Mr. Thompson. - Oh, hello Anderson. I heard you took in one of the orphan kids. How's it working out? - Oh, just great. You should think about trying it yourself. There's more where I come from, you know. - Clever little fellow, isn't he? - Mrs. Anderson has a small list. And the boy needs some clothes and a pair of boots. - [Mr. Thompson] We should be able to take care of him. This is one of the best catalogs I've seen. - [Nils] Thank you. How long for delivery? - They guarantee in three weeks, no later. - [Nils] I have to get my oats in by the end of August. - Oh, there wouldn't be any problem at all, no problem. - [Nils] Fine, now about the boots and clothes for the boy. - Yes, I'll get 'em right away. - Billy? Olaf? Where are you? (metal clinking) (wagon rumbling) - One more time, one more time. Where's the red card, where's the red card? Get the red card, red card's the winner. Where is it, where is it? Come on. Keep your eye on the red card. Keep your eye on the red card. Red card's the winner. Win the red card, you're the winner. Come on. One more time, Olaf. You can do it this time. Come on, everybody's a winner in this game. Okay, here we go, here we go. Here we go, red card's the winner. Anyone's a winner, let's go. - [Olaf] Um, that one. - Wrong again. All right, one more time, Olaf. Let's try it. Let's go, keep goin', here we go. - [Nils] Olaf, go to the wagon. - But Papa, Billy was- - Olaf. How dare you? You cannot clean a stall or dig a post hole, but you know how to steal and play the devil's gamekeeper. You will not teach your sin to Olaf. - Maybe I can teach him how to have a little fun. - Cards and gambling and not my idea of fun. - What is? I haven't seen anything that looks like fun. All I see is rules and work. But then I guess work is why you took me in. - That is not true. - Why'd you take me in then, huh? - Because. When I see you get off the train that day I think maybe you wish for a fresh start. Maybe that is not what you wish for. But while you are in my house, you will obey God's laws and mine. Now pick up those cards and return them to Mr. Thompson. (chickens clucking) (soft fiddle music) (music box chiming) (wagon rumbling) Ho. (Nils and Mother talking quietly) (footsteps clomping) - Nils told me what happened. It is very wrong to steal, and you must accept that if we are to live together. - It was only a deck of cards, for crying out loud. - Billy, don't you understand? You don't have to steal anymore. Not cards, not anything. You are not alone now. We are here to help you. - He'll never like me. - Billy, that is not so. I know that Nils is a demanding man, but there is goodness in him, too. Try to understand him. Help him to understand you. You know, when Nils first brought you here, I was not sure he had done right. But now I think it is good for all of us. Already you are very special to Olaf. So. Supper is almost ready. Try on your new clothes and come down so I can see you, huh? I almost forgot. I brought you this. - This was Christian's, wasn't it? - Yes, yes it was. (speaking in foreign language) - Amen. (church organ music) (singing in foreign language) - Well if your team is so good, why doesn't your pa go against Virgil Slater in the horse pull? Or is he afraid he will lose? - He's not afraid of anything. Maybe he will. - That's what you said last year and we never saw your team. - Who was that guy? - Sven Steemsond. He likes to cause trouble. - Well, how do you pull a horse? (Olaf laughing) - Not pull a horse, a horse pull. It's a contest. You fill a sled with big stones until it's very heavy. Then the teams take turns trying to pull the sled. Each time they add more stones. They keep going until there's only one team left and they win. - So will your pa enter? - I don't think so. - Why not? Afraid you'll have too much fun? - Maybe it's too much like gambling, but mostly for Papa I think Freya and Twoson are still Christian's horses. Come on, maybe you can drive the team on the way home. (wagon rattling) - Whoa. - Welcome, Oskar. We said welcome then. - Tack. - We came for the bull calf, Nils. - Mmm-hmm, sure. Olaf, Billy, go to the barn, get a rope. Bring the calf. - We didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. - Oh, nay. - You're just in time for dessert. Come in. (cows mooing) - Pffftt. Got a smoke? - Wish I did. This guy Anderson almost drowned me the last time I lit up. - What are these folks like? - Well, the lady and the kid are all right. The old man's hard. All he does is work and pray. People around here got more religion than the nuns in that dump of an orphanage I used to be in. What about your place? - Awful. All it is is work and more work. They don't even have any other kids. The old man, he can't even speak good English. He's always jabbering to me in Swedish. This place ain't for me. For two cents, I'd hit the road. - Yeah. We don't got two cents. But we gotta get outta here. Let me think on it. I'll find a way. - [Nils] Billy? - There's gonna be somethin' after church next week. Sunday. Maybe we'll see each other. - [Christina] Here you are. - Da. - [Nils] Looks like a good calf. - Yeah, it does. - [Mrs. Johansson] Who is this tea for? Oh, yeah. (speaking in foreign language) (crickets chirping) - [Nils] Billy? - I wanted to make sure the mare had plenty of water. - You like animals, don't you? - I guess so. Didn't get much chance to be around them in New York. - Yeah. Well. Time for milking. (bright acoustic music) (people murmuring) (bright fiddle music) (kids laughing) - I wish you could see New York. Last year they opened the Brooklyn Bridge. One of the wonders of the world. 100 feet high and so long you can't see the other side. And I walked across it. - It can't be. - And at night when the theaters let out, you can watch the wonderful ladies in diamonds and furs and the gentlemen in top hats. Oh, you should see the horses and carriages. Not like these plow horses, but swell horses of all kinds. - Maybe you should learn a little something about farm horses. You'd think better of them. - I know all about plowing. I'm gonna be handling the team by myself any day now. - Farmer, eh? From what I hear you can't tell the difference between a cow's tit and her tail. - In New York we didn't need to know the difference, but if I can't figure it out, I'll come and ask you. I can tell you're a real tit and tail expert. - You like New York so much, why don't you and the rest of the dirty orphans go back there? - Sven! (kids screaming) - Come on, give it to him, Billy, let's go! - Give it to him! - [Charlie] Come on, Billy! Come on, Billy! (kids screaming) (water splashing) - [Nils] Come here. Come here, Billy! Billy! - I'll get! - [Sven] I'll get you tomorrow, huh! I'll get you tomorrow, you! - [Christina] Olaf, come on. Come here. Come over here. (wagon rattling) - Whoa. Whoa. It is you that is stubborn! Hah. I made a mistake when I brought him here. - Nils. I think you are wrong. Billy is just a boy. A confused, frightened boy. Do you remember how frightened we were when we first got off that terrible boat from Sweden? - [Nils] Hmm, yeah. - We didn't know anyone. Nothing was like it was at home. I didn't even dare to eat the food. (Nils laughing) And then we came to Nebraska. - Mmm, and nobody could understand our English. (both laughing) And we had to make silly signs whenever we wanted anything. - Yes. Yes. That's what it's like for Billy. He still feels like an outsider. - How would you change him? - I don't know. - Maybe there is a way. I will give him one more chance. Independence day is two weeks away. I was thinking maybe I could enter Freya and Twoson in the pulling contest. I would like you to help me with the training. (chickens clucking) Maybe we could win. (bird squawking) (thunder clapping) (horses whinnying) - Papa, I think a storm is coming. - May be just the heat. This harness hasn't been used for years. - Why don't you use a regular harness? - 'Cause a pulling contest is much more weight than plowing. To win a team will have to pull five, maybe 6000 pounds. They must start with great force and keep pulling very, very hard. Snap is much too worn. Let's go to the barn and get another. Billy. Come here. Take the lines. (thunder clapping) (horse whinnying) Be back soon. - I'm sorry I told the other boys you were not so good with milking. You sure put that Sven Steemsond in his place. He won't bother you anymore. Aren't you glad we're gonna be in the contest, Billy? - If it makes your pa easier to live with, then I'm glad. But I can't see what pulling a bunch of stones around a pasture proves. - Can I hold the lines? - Sure. Why'd your pa change his mind? - I think he decided to enter the contest for you. He hopes the contest will make you like it better here. And so do I. I'm glad you came to live with us, Billy. It's like having a brother all over again. (thunder clapping) (horses whinnying) (thunder clapping) - Hold on! (upbeat acoustic music) (horse hooves clomping) - Whoa, whoa. Whoa, boy, you're safe, you're safe. Olaf. You all right? - Yes, Papa. - Yeah? - I told you to hold the team. If you had held the lines tight even with the thunder, they never would have run. You teach my son sinful ways. You shame me in front of my neighbors. And now because you refuse to do as I ask, Olaf might've been killed. - But Papa. - Olaf, go to the house. - When I write Miss Hill it is no good, you will go back. - Go ahead! Write her! I don't need you or you're stinkin' farm! Or your stinkin' horses! I don't need anything! (dramatic music) (thunder clapping) (wind howling) - [Danny] Billy, what are you doing here? Some night, huh? - Danny, I'm leaving. I've had it. - It's storming, where you goin'? - Ah, it's just a little wind. I figured I'd walk to Central City in four days. I got food and I know which trail to take. From there I can hop a train to head east. So, you wanna come? - No, Billy, I don't. The Johanssons, they ain't such bad people. The old lady makes a fuss over me and I make the old man laugh. And they said they want to adopt me. Don't you understand, Billy? It's a chance to be somebody, not just a dirty orphan kid. It's a chance for a home at last. - Danny? Danny? Danny, the prairie's on fire. We must plow a fire break to stop it! Hitch up the horses. (thunder clapping) (door thudding) (thunder clapping) (wind howling) - Mama, I can't find Billy. He went to the room after he fought with Papa, but he's not there. I think he's gone. (thunder clapping) (wind howling) (chickens clucking) (thunder clapping) (wind howling) (horses whinnying) - [Nils] Hup, hup! - Nils! Nils, Billy's gone! We must go look for him! - He's just angry. I told him to go back. - No, Billy said he's taken his things. And the money is missing from the tin. - You see, Christina, the kind of boy he is? Cheat, cheat. I will not have Christian's place in this house taken by a boy like that. - He is not taking Christian's place! Christian is gone, Nils! - Hold! Hold! - We can love his memory, but now he's gone. Billy is a good boy. He will find his own place in our hearts. He already has. (thunder clapping) There has been too long an emptiness for our dead son. Olaf needs a brother. And we need someone with whom to share our love. I want our sadness to end. I want to hear laughter again in this house. Please go look for him, Nils. You must- - Christina, the fire is coming. I must finish this fire break. We will look for Billy in the morning. Tonight he must take care of himself. Yah! Freya! Yah! Twoson! (thunder clapping) (wind howling) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (Nils grunting) - [Olaf] Papa! - Yeah, yeah. Get it there, hold that. (speaking in foreign language) - Papa, the barn! Papa, the barn! - Eh, you go. - You come back! - [Nils] Pull, Christina, pull. (dramatic music) Christina, get some water! - Oh! (fire crackling) (cows mooing) - Olaf, go in the barn. Get the animals out. Olaf! (fire crackling) (horses whinnying) (horse hooves thudding) (fire crackling) (horses whinnying) - [Olaf] Ooh! (fire crackling) - Nils? I think Olaf is still in the barn and I can't get the door open. (horse whinnying) - Olaf! - [Christina] Olaf! Olaf! (fire crackling) (horses whinnying) (horse hooves thudding) - [Nils] Ahh! - [Christina] Oh, Nils! Oh, oh! (Billy grunting) (fire crackling) (horses whinnying) - [Billy] Uh! - [Christina] Oh, Olaf! Come, Olaf. You're all right. - Come on. Olaf will be all right. Get some water. Go to the house. (fire crackling) (rain pattering) - Nils? Nils, it's raining! - Give me another chance. I don't wanna go back. I wanna stay to be here with all of you. Can we start again? - It's I who need a second chance. I was, uh, stubborn and foolish. Yes. We can start again. - And again and again if we have to. - But I don't think I can enter the pulling contest. - Teach me to drive the team. - I can help. - I can do it, I promise I can do it. - Yes. I believe you can. (gentle music) - And the final contestants are Virgil Slater's team and the Anderson mares. (crowd clapping) - [Billy] Whoa, whoa. - You're looking fine. - Good luck, Billy. - Ready? Don't worry. Remember what I told you. These horses have a lot of heart. They will pull for you. - Whoa, there. Well, Anderson, looks like we'll finally get to see what your mares can do against my geldings, huh? Girls against the boys. Remember, this ain't New York, son. Don't let 'em run away with ya. (laughing) - I hope I don't let you down. - Do your best, you won't let us down. Good luck. - Drivers, line up your teams and go to the starting areas. - [Virgil] Whoa. Whoa. (weight clinking) - The weight is now 7,300 pounds. (crowd murmuring) - Hah! Pull! Pull! Hah-ya! Pull, horse! Pull, yeah! Come on! Pull, horse! Come on, come on horse, come on! Come on horse, pull it down! (crowd clapping) (crowd murmuring) (horse whinnying) - Come on Freya and Twoson. This is it. Yah! Yah! Yah, go Freya, Twoson! (crowd shouting) - Pull, hoo! (crowd shouting) - [Kids] Go! Go! Come on! Aww! - The winner is Virgil Slater. (crowd clapping) - Good job, young man. Darn good job. - [Sven] Nice job. - Good job. - [Olaf] Billy, you did great! - We're both so proud of you. You were wonderful. - I wanted to win so bad. - You did fine, just fine.
