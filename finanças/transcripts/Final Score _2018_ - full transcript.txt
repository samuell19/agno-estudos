Revolution in the Russian state of Sakovya, as the people continue their fight for independence. Sakovya stands united behind the Belav brothers. Dimitri and Arkady Belav are the inspirational figureheads of this revolution. - Belav! - Belav! Charismatic politician Dimitri and the brutal General Arkady are pushing back the Russian forces in an incredible display of will. As war rages, and with no clear road to peace, bodies are mounting up and the human cost is spiraling out of control. It's hard to see an end to this bloody conflict. News just in that revolutionary leader Dimitri Belav was killed today in a Russian air strike. As Sakovya comes to terms with the loss of its much loved leader, the will of the people and the revolution itself is crumbling. Unable to maintain control on his own, Dimitri's brother, General Arkady Belav, was captured today, signaling the end of this violent revolution. The war, for now, is over. This way! He's over here! I had him. Get in. You know who I am? Yes. Good. Then we can dispense with any formal introduction. Tell me where he is. Tell me where he is. Sorry, do you not hear me? Tell me where he is! Fancy a cab, mate? Hold tight, tonight is football night. West Ham against Dynamo. Last ever match at the Boleyn Ground. - It don't get any better... - Fucking soccer. I can change it if you like. - Please. - No problemo, mate. Thanks, man. It's better. So tell me, big man, whereabouts are you from? From the States. First time in London? - Sixteenth. - Sixteen times? Flippin' heck, you must have family here. Had. A brother. Financial market suffered losses today as unrest in the Russian state of Sakovya raised fears of instability in the region... You're grounded, Danni. You know that. - You think I like doing this? - Yes, I do. You don't have your own life, so you just... - Danni! - ...fuck with mine! Danni! It's hard for me, too. - Shit! - Give me your money, little girl. - Get the fuck off me! - Ow! Oh, my God. You scared the shit out of me, Uncle Mike. Danni, come here. How you been? What are you doing here? Having a brain aneurysm, I think. Well, you know, Dad always said if I can't use my hands, use my head. - Use your head. - Yeah. I got something for you. You know how much I love soccer. - Big game. - Are you serious? Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, let's do it. - I can't. - What do you mean you can't? I'm grounded. Ah. - Suddenly The Great Escape makes sense. - Hmm. What are you grounded for? For having a life. I'll talk to your Mom. We'll figure it out, all right? Yeah, you just... you just go to the bar and now I'll go this way. Get your ass back up that little window, or we don't stand a chance. I've missed you, big fucker. I missed you, too. And watch your language. Little shit. Hi. Hey. You don't have to keep doing this, you know. Doing what? Traveling halfway around the world just to check on her. No idea what you're talking about. Just came for one of those shitty, warm pints of beer you serve. - Coming right up. - All right. - So how have you been? - Yeah, good. I was... I was hoping to take Danni to the game. No, I'm sorry, Mike. She's grounded. Can she be ungrounded? I'm sorry. Look, why don't you come over here on Sunday instead? We're having a bit of a gathering. Claire will be there. - And still single. - Mm-hmm. Well, tell her I said hello. But, um... I got to fly out Friday. When are you going to stop? You can't keep hiding in war zones forever, Mike. Yeah. I'm good. Listen to me. What happened to Andy, it wasn't your fault, Mike. Got to let it go. You know, Andy used to talk about going to the games with Danni all the time. I've never seen him so happy. It would mean a lot to me. Just one night. Can I take her? - No drinking. - Nope. - No smoking. - No. - And definitely no boys. - Definitely no boys. The atmosphere is electric at the Boleyn Ground tonight for this European Cup semifinal. West Ham's last ever match here. Opponents, Dynamo in Europe for the first time, of course. Emotions running high, in what promises to be a dramatic dogfight. Don't go out of my sight, or your mom will kill me. Danni, ever get off that thing? "WTF, she was such a bitch, looked at my boyfriend." Fuck you. Fuck's up with those guys? They're the Dynamo fans. Assholes. Danni? Thank you. Straight through. Press passes, please. Straight through, please. Press pass, please, sir. Straight through. Hold it, mate. ID please. All right, yeah. Go on, through you go. Go on. Keep going. I can't believe you found me in all this chaos. - You're too hot to miss. - Come on. - It's true. - This is a bit embarrassing. You're killing me, Smalls. Just run off on me. Uncle Mike, this is Brandon. What's up, bruv? Let's go watch some soccer. Bye, Brandon. - Text me, yeah? - Yeah. She is well up for it. Seriously? What? He's a dick. - He's cute. - He's not cute. You can do way better. All right, let's do this. Jeez, are you serious? - Can they make that any smaller? - You're getting fat. I'm not getting fat, smart ass. Let's get a hot dog. - You want a hot dog? - I'm starving. They fill them with shit, Uncle Mike. Between that punk kid and no hot dogs, you're making all the wrong life choices, Danni. Check it out. Pretty cool, right? Yeah, pretty cool. Great seats. We can see all the fake injuries from up close. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the players for West Ham United! Come on! And their opponents in this final match at the Boleyn Ground, from Sakovya, Russia, Dynamo FC. Dynamo! Dynamo! Dynamo! Dynamo! Dynamo! Dynamo! Dynamo! Dynamo! One-nil would do us here. That's what we need. Long as we don't concede an away goal, we got a good chance of getting into the final. I literally didn't understand one word you just said. You know nothing about football. God, you sound just like your dad. He would have loved this. So, what do we yell? Kick the ball straight up! Fall down better! You okay? Why did he have to do it? Do what? Die. He was a hero. I'm sick of hearing that. I'd rather Dad was a coward and still be here than a hero and dead. Don't say that. He obviously didn't care about me. What are you talking about? He loved you more than anything. Then why did he choose strangers over me and Mum? He was a soldier. - He took an order. - Well, it was a shitty order. Dad was even more shitty for obeying it. Danni. I think I'd like that hot dog now. Sure. Thank you. What can I get you? Two hot dogs, please, mate. What can I get you, mate? - You need anything? - Two hot dogs, please. How's West Ham looking? Good. Seen something you don't like, John? This far corner's gotten busy. Well, just keep an eye on it. Sir. Looks like it might have been a power surge, sir. Okay, everybody all right? - Yeah? Online? - Sir. They're blind. Don't let your passion blind you. Hey, you can't come in here. - Oy! - What the hell's going on? Get down on the floor. You, sit down. Superintendent Thompson, we have isolated your comms. You have no contact with the outside world. As goal commander, your men in the stadium will call you every 10 minutes, and you will respond that everything's normal. No, I will not. This is your wife, Sarah Thompson. Your children, Chloe, nine, and Ben, seven. Still dressed as they were before you left. The man who took these pictures is waiting at your home in Burlington Drive, and I can say with absolute certainty that Sarah, Chloe and Ben would want you to make sure that he stays in his car. Where are we with the masts? Almost there. Two more minutes. Viktor, lock us down. And as kickoff time fast approaches, without further ado, we'll hand you over to our commentators, John Anderson. And first up, it's a very good evening to Jonathan Pearce. Yes, thank you very much, Matt. And after a little hiccup with the stadium lights here, the spotlight is firmly back on West Ham for this historic final match at the Boleyn Ground. And the atmosphere really is absolutely electric at this famous old stadium. You took your time, sweetheart. - How you been? - Been good, how are you? Yeah, I'm all right, I'm all right. Christ, if he's family and you grow up to look like him, me and you are... He's not my real uncle. He visits all the time and looks out for me and my mum. Yeah, well, the guy's a tosser. Stick around with us. With me. This is Danni. Text me, will you? Damn it, Danni. All masts are set and ready, sir. Do it. Let's get this show on the road. My Instagram's fucked. So is mine. Look at that... Okay, we are locked into all cameras. Starting the search for him now. There is no hiding... brother. Beginning with the Dynamo stand, it will find him. Hmm. We hunt by computer. Don't worry, because our technicians are doing their upmost to rectify the situation, yeah. We're trying our best. Oh, they probably don't even have phones where you're from. - What, Brixton? - Brixton via Baghdad. I should call a terror alert on you. Oh, yeah, well, please go ahead. No, wait, you can't, because as per your complaint, the phones are down, aren't they? Ugh! What you're doing is terrorism! Emotional terrorism! Excuse me. I can't find my niece, man. Is there any way you can help me? Maybe she's gone to the little girls' room. No, she's been gone too long for that. Well, it depends, doesn't it? If she's eaten the food from here, it could take her into the second half to work it all out. I'm afraid she may have left the stadium. It's not possible. The gates are jammed shut. No one in or out at the moment. - How is that safe? - Don't worry. There are people with brighter futures than mine who are fixing the glitch as we speak. Look, Faisal. No, it's Faisal. Faisal Khan. If anyone Khan, Faisal Kahn. Look, if you're really worried about it, I can always call up to the control room. They've got CCTV up the ass. Yeah, that'd be great, thank you. Control, this is Faisal. Assistant to the assistant chief steward. We have a missing child. What's her name? Danni Halloway. Subject's name is Danni Halloway. Five feet seven inches, brown hair, 15 going on 50. Control room, do you read me? Ignore it. Hello? Is that the control room? Yeah, just there. Can you take me up there? Look, I'm not really supposed to... Just tell me how to get up there, please. Well, basically you have to go down this corridor and... You'll never find it. Come on. Oh, it's a nervy start for the home side here. That's a good through ball... West Ham are in trouble! Dynamo have scored! That is a disastrous start for West Ham. The Hammers trail one goal to nil. Come on, West Ham! Ron, where's the... You're not Ron. Where's Ron? Holidays. Cheeky bastard. He owes me a tenner, he does. He told me he'd pay me back today. I'm just taking the big fella up to control. Not admitted. Technical difficulty. You come back later. I got to find my niece, man. I'm not coming back later. You're going to want to move now. Of course. Apologies. I couldn't help but notice an accent. Where are you from, man? Russia. Hmm. It looks cold there. Is it cold? Ground floor. Going up. It's cozy, isn't it? How come you've got Ron's badge on? Fuck! Fuck! Faisal, move! Going up. Aah! Faisal, give me the gun. Give me the gun! Floor three. Going up. What the fuck is going on? Why'd he try to kill us, man? Stay quiet. - Floor four. - Calm down. Calm down. All right, hold these doors open. Hello? Hello, come in. Someone... Stay off the radio. The phones are down, the gates are jammed. This fucking stadium is on lockdown. And you're going to have to trust me until we figure out what the fuck it is, okay? It's going to be all right. I knew I should have taken that job at Arsenal. Come on, grab a leg. No! I am not touching a fucking dead fella, okay? Grab the fucking bag then. No, not that one, just... Quiet! Dead on the shitter, just like Elvis. What? What is it? - That's C-4. - C-4? What, you mean like highly explosive C-4? Yeah, that's the one. Hold that. Are you shitting me? What if it goes off? - What the...? - Not without a detonator, it's not. - Stop worrying. - Stop worrying? I'm covered in blood, trapped in a siege and carrying fucking explosives. But don't worry about it. Faisal, can you get me to a working phone? - Yeah, I think so. - Take me. Uh, this way. Now lock that door. Shit. You need to press nine for an outside line. And we're not supposed to make international calls, but I guess this is an emergency, so... Phone lines are dead. What are you doing? I'm going to re-calibrate this to a police frequency. Where did you learn to do that? Saw a guy do it on TV once. Yes! Okay. Attention, anyone on this frequency, there's an emergency situation at West Ham stadium. Services please dispatch. - Yes! - This channel is reserved for police personnel. Prank calls are strictly forbidden. This is not a prank call. Men with firearms and explosives have infiltrated the stadium. They've locked down the exits and blocked all cell communications. How do you know this, sir? Because I just killed one of them. Please hold. Turn off your bloody phone. It's the other one. Sorry, sorry. Is everything okay? I'll find out. Sorry. Oh, really. - This is Steed. - It's Milson. We've had a report of armed men at Upton Park. A guy claims to be former US Army. Likely bullshit, but one thing he says does check out: the phones are down at the stadium. - That doesn't mean... - Check it out. The goal commander at the stadium will have a sat phone. Sat phone, yeah, I know I'm on it. I'm patching you through. Goal commander's name is Stephen Thompson. The weather is fine. No idea what you're talking about. Well, if it becomes unseasonably cold, I will kill your family. - Steve Thompson. - Steve, hi. This is Chris Burrows from Telecom. I understand you're having some problems with your phones? - Yeah, they've all gone down. - Shit of a night for it. We're sending our engineers down. Just wondering what gear to wear. How's the weather? It's fine. I heard it was unseasonably cold. That's a negative. The weather's absolutely fine. Okay, thanks, Steve. Tatiana, check in with everyone. Viktor, status? No matches yet. We're now searching the whole stadium. Computer's taking too long. Ollie, how are we doing? Eight more minutes, sir. Then don't waste time talking to me. Da. It's taking way too long. They will come back eventually. I got a 15-year-old girl walking around out there. The longer this takes, the more chance she's got of pissing off someone with a gun. I'd like to inform whoever's on this line that you're wasting police time and you've just committed a criminal offense. Who the fuck's this? This is Chief Commander Daniel Steed of the Metropolitan Police Force. This channel is now blocked. Thank you. What do you mean, blocked? Come in! They're not coming, are they? - Think we're fucking around. - So, what are we going to do? We need to show them that we're not fucking around. Roll call, everyone. Vlad? - Da. - Anton? - Da. - What is it? - Pavel? - They're checking in. - Emil? - Da. - Alex? - Da. - Nikita? - Da. - Yuri? - Da. - Boris. - Da. - Pyotr? - Da. Andrei? Andrei? That's us. Knox, say something. Andrei? Da. Nice. Andrei... What does that mean? It's Russian for we've got to move. Whoa, whoa, do we? Is hiding here not an option? Because I feel like it's an option. Faisal, you can stay here and hide, but Andrei didn't check in. They're gonna send someone to look for him, and they're going to find you and they're going to kill you. We got to move. No, wait, we don't have access to the doors up here. - Does Ron? - Yeah, but he's on holiday. - No, he's not. He's dead. - Sorry, buddy. Let's go. There's a problem with Andrei. Pavel, check on Andrei. Sir. Andrei? Andrei? Let's take the stairs. Andrei. This is no time to be taking shit. Andrei. Andrei? Breach, Zone 4. Cover is blown. Andrei is dead. Shot. - Police? - Negative. How do you know? Police don't leave dead bodies in toilet cubicle. Just down this corridor. There's some double doors on the right. Vice City, San Andreas, Liberty City Stories, GTA IV. What are you doing? I'm naming GTA games to distract myself. Isn't Zone 4 locked down? Keycard access only. Check Andrei for his access card. Negative, and not his radio. Load the data on Andrei's keycard. Fourth floor, banqueting area. Entering kitchen now. Lock it down. Send Vlad and Anton. As far as I can remember, there's a short cut here that goes straight to the roof. I don't get it. It should work. Oh, fuck. - Is there another door? - No. Back out of here. What the hell is going on? I would like to speak to the person who killed my man. Speaking. Listen, our motives here are political. Our intentions are to threat, not violence. So let's make a deal. Surrender yourself to my men and you'll be held captive until our work here is done. Resist, however, and you will be killed. I find it hard trusting someone who brings C-4 to a fucking soccer game. I thought Americans hated soccer. Yeah, I've been saying that all fucking day. You can go hide in this. - Come on, get in. - But he just said that we can make a deal. Faisal, these people are killers. They're not going to make a fucking deal, come on. There's only space in here for one, and you're two by yourself. Take out your cell phone. - That's Danni. - Yeah, that's charming, that is. Take a picture. Hurry. She's wearing a blue jacket with flowers all over it. Find her, get somewhere safe and radio me, all right? Okay. I'll send it right back up! Okay. You cover the right, I cover the left. Let us in. It's okay to come out. We mean you no harm. Fucking hell. Do you mind? What? The lift's broken. Fucking idiot. Anton! Anton! Anton, let me out! Aah! Fuck you! Vlad, Anton. Respond. Vlad. Vlad, come in. Sorry, cupcake. They're not with us anymore. No! The guy's not here. Vlad is dead. - What about Anton? - He's gone. Not sure where. You can keep... your warm goddamn beer... and your cold fucking weather... and your dead goddamn Russians. Here you go, Commander. Ignore this. Come on! Go, go, go! - Let's go! - Seal the stadium! Shit. Police are outside. All of them, it would seem. Can you continue with a clear head? - Soldiers die. - That was not an answer. Can I kill him? Of course. You'll stamp him out. Then I have a clear head. - Hmm. - Sir? Viktor. Nearly finished and still no matches. - The system should have found him by now. - He's here. If his appearance has changed too much, I cannot scan. - But I need more time. - No, we must move forward. Put your technology aside. Maybe we need to adopt more traditional means to find him. Are we ready? Sir. - Thank you. - Sir. Okay, Knox, you have my attention. I thought wasting police time was a criminal offense. Well, you just got me out of a very boring evening, so I'll turn a blind eye this time. What are we dealing with? Highly skilled paramilitary, Eastern European. No idea what they want. - How many? - I counted 10. Three less than 20 minutes ago. I appreciate what you've done here, but a lone hero at this point... Not trying to be a hero. My niece is in the stadium, I'm not leaving without her. Congratulations to our vigilante. You've succeeded in turning a private matter into a very public one. Be my guest and listen in. We're back on air in 25 minutes, everybody. Now let's cut that VT. Hey, studio crew only. What are you...? - Put us on air. - Everybody shut up! Keep absolutely fucking still. You, get up. Get on camera, cut the feed to the commentators... On your fucking knees. If you and your friends want to live, you'll read statement. I've been told to read the following statement. - S i r! - For the last 17 years, Her Majesty's government has been harboring a war criminal: rebel insurgent Dimitri Belav. - Check that name for me, Dimitri Belav. - Sir. We know he's somewhere in this stadium tonight. We demand the government give us his location. One hundred blocks of C-4 explosives have been placed throughout the arena. If Dimitri Belav's location is not given to us by the time the match clock reaches 90 minutes, we will detonate the explosives. Thirty-five thousand souls for one. If any attempt is made to enter the stadium in any capacity, we will detonate the explosives. If any attempt is made to contact the hostages within the stadium, we will detonate the explosives. Several people have died today, and more will follow. How many is up to you. The clock is ticking. Do it. No! No, no, please... Boom. I want this block cleared. A direct comms link to Cobra. And scramble the SAS. Now! Well, we seem to have lost our link to the studio for the moment, but we will carry on commentating regardless of course. Well, I don't know, John. You can't get the staff these days. Faisal, tell me something good. Hey, man! It's good to hear your voice. I thought for sure you were... - Any sign of Danni? - Right, no, not yet. I am searching, though. I'm trying. All right. You check the north stands, I'm going to search the east. Got it. What about the cops? Did they show up? Yeah. The world outside this place knows what's happening, but the people in here are still blind and we got to keep it that way. Crowd figures out what's going on, there'll be a stampede. - Copy? - Yeah, copy that. All right. Just keep looking for her. Come on, kid, where are you? - Come on. - Hey. Maybe I should go back. Uncle Mike... Oh, fuck him. He doesn't own you. Brandon, stop. I thought we came here to talk. No more talking. Let's loosen up a bit, shall we? Shit. I'm a pub kid. That's him. Track back. Follow him. What am I looking for? Something we can use against him. This is Commander Daniel Steed. I'm here to assist in peaceful negotiation for an end to this situation. I will need the following... A couple of hostages as a show of good faith? Here's how that would play out. I would agree, and then I would shoot three women and drop them from the balcony into the car park in front of the world's media as a show of resilience. Shall we not go down that road? You have the exterior surrounded, Commander, but I hold all the cards. So how do we resolve this peacefully? I believe I have expressed my demands quite vividly. I was told that Dimitri Belav is dead. You are further behind than I thought. Do not call me back until you have caught up. Can you tell us what's happening? Get me more information, and fast. One false move and we have a bloodbath here. - And when are the SAS due? - Five minutes out. - Already briefed. - Thank you. Sir, they're sending through an Agent Cho. I don't know him. - He's not one of ours. - Well, who gave him clearance? Not me, sir. It came from the top. - Steed. - And who might you be? I'd like to see the body, please. This way, sir. - Oh, shit. - What? This is Anton Ivanov. This is almost as bad as I thought. Everybody, clear out. Now! Sir. What I'm about to tell you stays between us, understood? Of course. Show him the file. This is Sakovya, Russia, right now. Thousands have gathered in the street at the mere mention of Dimitri Belav's name. Why? Who is he? Twenty years ago, he and his brother led an uprising. A fight for independence. Officially, he was killed in 1999. Unofficially? Dimitri's revolution was out of control, killing more people than it was saving. He had to stop it, so he came to us. We faked his death. He was given extensive plastic surgery, and moved to London under diplomatic amnesty. Without its charismatic leader, the revolution crumbled. Peace was restored, and Dimitri's brother, Arkady, was jailed for war crimes. He is the man who has taken control of your stadium. Can I see the mustard? Thanks. Three months ago, he found out about Dimitri's betrayal. We need to find Dimitri Belav's location inside the stadium immediately. We may have no choice but to hand him over. We conspired with him. We can't have that lie exposed. If Arkady kills him on live TV, it'll cause a shit storm. It'll not only destroy a country, it'll destabilize the entire region. The lives of millions are at stake. So, I'm not here to assist handing Dimitri over, Commander. I'm here to ensure that he stays dead. That's good. Sir, I traced him back to his seat. And? His name is Michael Knox. He bought his ticket with a credit card from a US account for him and a girl. He's ex-Army, no fixed abode. Officially inactive, but bounces from place to place working for private sector. And the kid? I ran her through metadatabase. She comes up as Danni Halloway, 15. Two recent police cautions, one for fighting at school, and the other for vandalism of public property. And this is where it gets interesting. Her father was killed in action while serving under Knox. And where is she now? Bringing up live feed. I should probably get back to Uncle Mike. - Come on. - But he'll be worried about me. Well, let him worry. - Come on! - We didn't come down here to talk. Yes, I did. Fucking let go! You teasing slag. Think I'm missing this game to hear you whine about your dad and your fucking uncle? Oh! You fucking stupid... Uncle Mike was right. You are a dick. Could Danni Halloway please report to Gate 8. Danni Halloway. Danni Halloway please report to Gate 8. Faisal, what the hell? Hey, man, it's not me! Fuck. Faisal, it's them. - Can you see Danni? - I can't, I'm sorry! I'm looking! We cannot let her get to that gate, you hear me? They're waiting for her. Oy, I see her! Lower level, west stand! Two minutes added time. It's two minutes. Danni! Danni! Dynamo taking control of the game now. This is a great run by Goldov. Oh, lovely tackle by Garver. West Ham, they're going to push forward. Frost to Thornley. Danni! Sir, I have him. Set your police on him. Remove that pest, or I remove you. All available men to the northwest corner. Big guy, army jacket. Take him down. Hold it! Wait! Danni! - Danni! - Come here! Danni! Get out my fucking way! Oh, that's a nice play from Johnson. Danni! The West Ham wunderkind is pushing down the wing. Oh, that's a terrible foul... Get the fuck off me! Hold him! Higginson with the free kick, looking for an equalizer. Danni! Danni! Shit. Uncle Mike? That's a goal! What a goal! Danni! Faisal, where's Danni? I have Danni. I've got her, Knox. Over and out. Great job, Faisal. And an equalizing goal... We've lost them. They're under the flag. Miguel Hernandez! And that's the halftime whistle. West Ham have been shocked by the Russians' physicality at times, but they've stood firm and they're level at the interval. He got away, Sarge. Suspect is still at large. You have failed me, Superintendent. Seems you and your men are of no value to me. He's okay. He's just down here. - Uncle Mike! - Oh! - Danni, are you okay? - Yeah. - We got to get you safe. - Shit. Faisal, you know this place. There's got to be a way out of here. Come on, Faisal. Think. Okay, just... just follow me, okay? These turnstiles are old as fuck, but there's a trick you can use, right. All you need to do is apply pressure here - and it should... - Faisal, stop. Wait. Don't push that gate. It's a trigger. - If you push that gate... - And what? And what? Oh, shit. They weren't lying. Steed. - Come in, Steed. - Steed here. We've found their C-4. I'm here with Captain Reynolds of the SAS, and I'm putting you on open comms. Describe the device. Looks complicated. - Multiple wires. - Follow them. Some leading to the det, some lead... - Mercury switches. - Shit. What does that mean? It's rigged to blow if tampered with in any way. The only way to disarm that device is the kill switch. - What kill switch? - In the broadcast, the suspect was wearing a remote switch around his wrist. Should be able to deactivate the bomb. How much C-4 is there? - About 100 blocks. - Location? Southwest corner. We're right under the control room. Why place it under the control room? They'd die in the blast as well. No, they won't be anywhere near it. It's a diversion. They'll blow the control room and escape in the chaos. Jesus. How many casualties? We're looking at a blast radius of blocks G through N. That's thousands of people. Arkady doesn't care about the casualties. He only cares about one thing. The reason that stadium is still standing is because he doesn't have his brother yet. As soon as he gets Dimitri, he'll detonate his explosives. Look, we make an assault, get that kill switch. Not possible. There'd be too big a death toll. That may very well be, Commander, but we are running out of time here. All right, they want this Dimitri guy, right? - What if we get to him first? - I see a problem. We can't get into the stadium without being detected. You don't need to. I can get Dimitri. Give me his location, I'll grab him. Send the choppers up, I'll meet you on the roof. - This could work. - One condition. If I get Dimitri up to the chopper, you get Danni out of here with him. Deal? Let's do it. Our extraction point's the far corner above the south stand. It's out of the blast radius and downwind of the stadium. So that'll help mask our approach. But once we're in position, we're fully exposed. I need Dimitri's location. Dimitri is in seat B657. That's the far corner in the east stand. How long have we got? We estimate seven minutes for you to get to Dimitri's seat, another five to get him to the roof. It's tight, man. Once we start our approach, there's no turning back. They'll be coming for you, so watch yourself. In exactly 12 minutes, we'll be in position. Roger that. You better be there. Don't go. Danni, I've got to get this Dimitri guy or they're going to blow the stadium. I don't want you to die saving strangers, like my dad did. I'm not doing this to save strangers. Danni... You're going to be okay. We can do this. Hey, trust me. Look I don't want to spoil your little moment here, but we are literally stood next to a ticking bomb. Danni will be at the south stand in ten minutes. Go. Be careful. And so the second half gets underway. It's do or die for West Ham. They have to get more possession if they're going to go on and win this game and make the final. Sir, we have him. I think he's heading towards the Dynamo stand. He's going after Dimitri. Tatiana! Send everyone. This way, come on. - Quickly. - Okay. Fuck. Are you fucking kidding me... More paramedics for the lower west stand. Go! Oh! Whoa! Idiot! Control, come in. We've got him, boss. Go! Follow him. That's ?9, please. You pay. Get the fuck out of the way! Fuck you! - Fuck off! - Faisal, I need another route. - Well, what gate are you at? - Nine, ten. - Coming up to 11. - Hey! - What's going on? - I'm on a fucking bike. - Which way? - The opposite way. Fuck! - Wait! Stop! - Not possible. Oh, Jesus! I'm running out of concourse. Knox! Go up! Go up! No, no, go, double back! Cut him off! Faisal, where now? Get out to the gantry. You'll see a set of stairs. Fuck! Faisal, I see the stairs. Take them! Take the stairs! I'm on the roof. - You're on the roof? - You said take the stairs. I meant down, not up! Knox, there's no way to get across from there. It's a 60-foot drop. Just get Danni to the roof! I'll meet you there! West Ham are under pressure here. Dynamo is surging forward, as the Russians look to regain the lead. Bearing down on the goal, he beats one man. West Ham are in trouble. Oh, he made a right mess of that. They countered that shot... The Hammers are trying to wrestle back control. Oh, there's an opening here. Pushing down the wing, Dynamo look a little desperate. The Hammers have to take advantage here. In goes the cross... Hernandez brought down just outside the box. It's a free kick in a very dangerous position. Johnsson will take it. East London holds its breath. Here we go. Shit. Shit. Striding in... the shot... It's good! West Ham take the lead! Damn. Dimitri Belav. That's a name I haven't heard for a very long time. Viktor, check Knox's keycard. We don't have to. We have eyes on him. Not for Knox. For the Asian. I need you to come with me. I'm not missing the game. I'm not fucking asking. Come on, Danni. Two minutes. Where's Uncle Mike? He'll be here, don't worry. See? Give me the girl. No. I want you to know I'm not going to shoot you. I'm going to kill you... much slower than that. Move! - Who are you? - No one. Then what is this about? Your brother. If my brother is here, there is no point in running. Shut the fuck up and move. East stand now. East stand now. Commander Steed, we have two people to extract. Primary target is Dimitri Belav. Agent Cho to ID him. Head for the extraction point now. Stand by six-two. Pavel? North concourse now. Move! Fuck! Get down! Fuck. Shit. Go! Go! Go! Go! Move! Come on, move, move, move! They're trapped. East concourse toilets. There's no way out. Move in. Agent Cho, are you in position? Affirmative, but where the hell is Knox? Shit. They have more bullets than you. They really do have more bullets than you. You will need a detonator. How about a phone? Pavel? Pavel? Danni! Danni! Faisal, where the fuck are you? Where's Danni? Faisal? Come in. Where's Danni? Knox, I'm sorry, man. I lost her. Oh, fuck. Know, you have to send Dimitri up. We'll come back for the girl. I'm sorry, Uncle Mike. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Danni, where are you? She's with me, Uncle Mike. And she's dead if you take one more step towards the helicopter. Knox, you have to send Dimitri up. I can't do it. - Send him up now! - I can't do it. They've got Danni. There's got to be another way. We can't let Dimitri fall into their hands. Take him out. Do it now while we have a shot. We need Dimitri. Do not fire! Hey, ignore that prick. I have jurisdiction here. Take the shot or face a court-martial. Take the shot! - Yes, sir! - Oh, shit. Move! Swing around! Come on, move, move! The target is gone. Dimitri has cleared the roof. Pull right. You don't miss from that distance unless it's by intention, right? Who the fuck do you think you are, risking the lives of those people? - This is my scene. - And who are you? A jumped-up Met cop who can't see the woods for the fucking tree. There's more to this than a fucking soccer stadium! It's not soccer, it's football! You would kill all these innocent people just to get one person? Sacrifice is all about perspective. My uncle won't let you get away with this. Oh, really? He will do everything I ask because of you. Vigilante. Vigilante. You have something I need. Bring him to me now, or I will let Tatiana carve up your girl. You hurt Danni, I'll put a fucking bullet in your brother's head right now. Clearly you are a man of skill and talent. I am a man of will. Do not test me. When I was a child, my father had chickens. He kept many chickens. There was one I loved, and I called her One-Eyed Clara. She was the runt. I have a soft spot for the underdog. One morning, we went out to the pen, to a horrific scene. Blood, feathers. A fox had slaughtered three birds. I was relieved to see that my beloved Clara was still alive. However, that night... my father took her out into the open, chained her to a tree. Hours passed until we heard the fox ripping Clara apart. My father... aimed his rifle... and bang. Killed the fox. Clara was dead, but so was the fox. The other chickens were safe now. Sometimes, you have to sacrifice the thing you love the most for the greater good. You think your story is supposed to teach me something about sacrifice? Been down that path. Me, my best friend. He was more like a brother to me. We got together, the best guys we knew, fought together for a couple of years. But in Afghanistan... I lost my whole team. Including my brother. Andy died on my fucking watch. I'm not going to lose his daughter too. Okay, we do this. Dimitri for Danni. But on my terms. Make the exchange on the roof. You take the northeast corner, I'll take the northwest. How very Cold War. Very Checkpoint Charlie. You have a deal. Let's go. Into the last 15 minutes of the match we go. West Ham United clinging to the lead. Oh, that shot's clawed away by the keeper. Stop. Tatiana... stand off. Okay. Send him over. Send Danni first. Give her the kill switch and Dimitri's yours. One or the other. Not both. Danni, come on. You, go. Come on, Danni. No. Come on, Danni. Talk sense to her. Danni, listen to me. You have to do this. If you give him his brother, Uncle Mike, he'll kill all these people. Danni, please. Get down here. I know it was your order, Uncle Mike. I know you blame yourself, but my dad did what he had to do. I get it now. He was a hero. Danni, this isn't the same. You don't understand. Get down here. Now. I do understand. It wasn't your fault. People are important, and we've got to protect their lives, even if it costs us our own. Danni, you have to trust me. Come down here, now. No. I refuse to go. The next one is two inches to the left. Go. Send Dimitri. Danni, get ready. Run. Dimitri! Dimitri! Fire at will! Run, Danni, run! Down the stairs now. Knox has the kill switch! Repeat, Knox has the kill switch! Brother! Come on, get up! Come on, come on. This way, this way, this way. Straight through. Go, go, go. Come on. Come with me. - Rooftop is clear. - Where's Knox? Don't wait for Knox. Fuck you. What the fuck is this? There is no kill switch. At 90 minutes, you and your little bitch are going to burn. How do you stop it? How do you stop it? There's no way to stop it. You fucking bitch. Fuck you, cupcake. Dimitri. Look at you, brother. How you have changed. Why do you run from me? I have planned this moment for such a long time. A long time. You were expecting me to kill you... brother. Now, brother... please, sit. Viktor, prepare the broadcast. You know, when I first heard that you were not dead... You felt angry. Betrayed. At first. But then I saw the true reason you went into hiding. And the smartest thing to do would be to have been killed. It's because you knew the revolution would be reborn one day. Dimitri Belav is dead. And he will rise from the ashes like a phoenix. As soon as our people see you are alive, the revolution will start again. And this time we will win. Sir, we are ready to broadcast. Look, at home, the people await you. They will not follow just me. But you... You, they will follow through the gates of hell itself. And together, we will take back our country and give it to the people. This was your dream. Now, what would you give to see that dream realized? Anything. Anything. Prove it. Kill the girl. And together, we will finish the revolution. Please. You were right about many things, Arkady. We fought so very hard for our country, we almost destroyed it. But I kept you alive, not to wait for this moment, but because I love you. I could never kill her. This is the only way I can stop you from destroying our home. No, no, no! No! No! Arkady, we need to get out of here. Arkady... Just under five minutes left, and West Ham are clinging on for dear life. They're under pressure. Can they hold on? Down to willpower now. Faisal, come in Faisal. - Do you have Danni? - Negative. She didn't come out. Neither did Dimitri. Do you know where she is? - I don't know! - Faisal, listen to me. The kill switch was a fake. I can't stop it. The C-4s going to detonate at 90 minutes. - You what? - That's in four minutes! You got to get everyone out of the stands now. It's on you! Steed, do you have eyes on Danni? Negative. The roof is clear. Oy! Sit down! Everyone from Block G to Block N, please evacuate your seats and move away from the corner! - Fuck off, Paki! - Out of the fucking way! Oh, that's a cynical foul... Tempers are really fraying now, both on and off the field. West Ham have had enough. Move! West Ham push forward. It's time for them to try and put this one to bed. - Knox! - Faisal! Get everyone out of those stands, now! Faisal Khan. Faisal Khan. Faisal Khan! Faisal Khan! Fuck it. Allahu Akbar! I have a bomb! I have a bomb! I have a bomb! Oh, no, that looks like a bit of crowd trouble there. I hope it's nothing too serious, because we're just seconds away. Faisal, can you see Danni? Still haven't found her! Faisal, get out! Get out! Now! I think we're nearly clear. Please make your way towards the exits... Hey! Hey! Oh, fuck it. Madam! Danni. People of the west. I came here to reignite a revolution. To bring back to my country the leader it needs. Dimitri Belav. No, no, no! There's someone running onto the pitch. Chaos here. Steed, he's going to blow it with Danni there! No, stop, get away from the corner! He's got Danni in the control room! Get off the fucking field! You have given me something much more important: martyrdom. And tonight, you will all learn the true meaning of sacrifice! Danni! Blow up the gates! Let these people out! Come on! Go, go, go! Down the street! Danni! Danni! 85 minutes. - Steed. - Knox? - The video's a fake. - What? It's prerecorded. Arkady's still alive. He's got Danni. I've got thousands of people spilling out. I can't stop them. Danni! Danni! Uncle Mike! Uncle Mike! Danni! Uncle Mike! Help! Uncle Mike! Danni! Uncle Mike! - Help! - Drop your gun. Drop it, or I'll fucking shoot her right here. Okay, okay. Danni, be smart. Use your head. Use your head, Danni. Fuck you, Uncle Mike. Uncle Mike! Uncle Mike. You're okay. You're okay. Where's Faisal? Madam! Madam... Madam, don't worry about a thing. We have a tried and tested complaint-handling procedure here at West Ham. - Oh, thank you. - Faisal? It's all right. Faisal? - What's your name? - It's Faisal. - Faisal Ka... - Faisal. Hey, man! It's good to see you. Oh, that's too tight. That's way too tight. - Thank you. - Hey, don't mention it, man. - Danni! - Mum? - Mum! - Danni! Baby. I thought I'd lost you. I'm so sorry, Mum. I'm so sorry. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Hey. Thank you. Andy would have been proud of her. He'd be proud of you both. Thanks for your help, Knox, but do me a favor. If we reach the final, stay at home. Hell, yeah. Faisal... let's get out of here, buddy. - Yeah. - Come on, big fucker. Watch your language, you little shit. - You all right? - Yeah. Ironic thing is, I don't even like football. Oh, my God.
