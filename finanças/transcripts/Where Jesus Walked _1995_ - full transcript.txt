(ethereal music) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] This is more than landscape. To millions who have never set foot here, this land is home, reachable only by God's grace. It is the goal of pilgrims, the Promised Land, the Holy Land. Its geography is imprinted on almost every page of the "Bible". Places for whom multitudes feel a homesickness, even though most have never been here. Places, places dwelt on in sermons and remembered in prayers. Bethlehem, at birth, Cana, at marriage, Bethany, at death. It is a land thirsty for truth, a land of living waters. The River Jordan. The Sea of Galilee. The Pool of Bethesda. It is miracles recalled. Capernaum. Siloam. It is Mount Tabor and a vision of glory. This land is a land of pain. Of shame. Jerusalem. Calvary. And of triumph over death. From the Golan Heights to the Sinai. From the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea. From Nazareth to Jericho to Jerusalem. This is the land where Jesus walked. (dramatic music) The Holy Land. Shorelined by the Mediterranean and by the Dead Sea, its southern border melds with the Sinai Peninsula and the land of Egypt. Europe eyes it from the west, while the great Asian landmass reaches out to it from the Pacific. This is the navel of the world, from the far reaches of antiquity to the present. This land has been God's battlefield. The hammer God chose to pound out a plan for human salvation. It is a promised land. To the east lies the Fertile Crescent of the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers, (bright music) famous for the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and infamous for the ziggurat, Tower of Babel. But before Babylon was Assyria, and Sumeria, and the incredibly old city of Ur. The city of Ur, like the rest of Mesopotamia, was rife with idolatry. Marduk and Marok. Rife with gods and goddesses to whom people were as playthings. So the man whom the Lord came to call Abraham left Ur and settled in Haran. - [God] Go to the land I will show you. - [Narrator] Abraham, who was then called Abram, took his wife, and his nephew, and their belongings and caravanned to the land of Canaan. And the Lord appeared to him. - [God] To your offspring I will give this land. (inspirational music) - [Narrator] Though Abram was very old, he begat a son, Isaac, with his aged wife. But the Lord God tested him. - [God] Abraham, take your son whom you love and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering. - [Narrator] Without hesitating, Abraham obeyed. As the father raised the knife over his beloved son, an angel of the Lord stayed his hand. A ram was substituted for Isaac. This mosque, the Dome of the Rock, stands on Mount Moriah where this interrupted sacrifice took place. It houses what many believe is the rock upon which Abraham laid Isaac for the kill, a father sacrificing his son. It is an act destined to be repeated, and this time, completed. - [Woman] In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God. And the Word was God. - [Narrator] Through epochs, prophets spring from this land seeded by Abraham. And through the ages, these prophets foretell of the ultimate sacrifice who will be led like a lamb to the slaughter. - [Woman] The Word became flesh, and made his dwelling among us. - [Narrator] It is in the fulfillment of this prophecy that Jesus comes into the world. (dramatic music) As the age of the great prophets drew to an end, Jerusalem, the Holy Land's splendid capital, became a world city. (authoritative music) Then the long shadow of Rome fell over the land. Rome, the Colossus, the power by which all worldly power could be measured. She webbed the world with her robes and made it conform to her laws. Rome had made a province of the Promised Land. To Romans it was the runt of Asia. As historians measure it, it happens at the beginning of the Christian Era. A decree goes out from Caesar Augustus. - [Caesar] Census by imperial command, all Jews must register in their ancestral homelands. - [Narrator] Like their neighbors, Joseph, a tradesman, and his young wife, Miriam, obey the decree. (gentle music) But it is a rugged 90 miles to Bethlehem, the town of their ancestors. It will take close to two weeks, and Miriam is pregnant. The trip takes them through the Judean hills where Ruth of the Old Testament met Boaz while she was gleaning grain. Bethlehem itself means house of bread, and it is known as the City of David. It's a grueling journey. Any day now, Miriam, whom we call Mary, is due to give birth. There's no one to help, no midwife, no woman relative. Yet she is not afraid. It has been prophesied. - [God] A virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son. - [Narrator] This prophecy began to unfold here, where the Church of the Annunciation now stands in Nazareth. Built over the ruins of a Byzantine chapel, this is the largest church in the Middle East. Each of these murals was donated by a different nation. On this site, the Archangel Gabriel greeted Mary. She is an ordinary young woman with an extraordinary destiny. (people chattering) (gentle music) Bethlehem is a bedlam. Multitudes impatient to get the census taking over with. A room for the night, Joseph begs. A corner, a nook. My wife is already in labor. Well, you can bed down with the livestock. She can bear her offspring there. (sheep baaing) So in the darkness of a shelter for animals, light comes into the world. Today the Church of the Nativity stands over the place where that shelter stood. And this star marks the place where Jesus was born. This night, in fields fringing this City of David, shepherds tend their flocks, as David, once a shepherd himself, tended his. These are not ordinary shepherds. They are descended from the priestly tribe of Levi. Their flocks are raised for the holiest of purposes, sacrificed in the temple of Jerusalem. These shepherds must guard their sheep from impurities, keep them acceptable to the priests of the temple. Yet the shepherds themselves are forbidden to enter the temple courts. Theirs is the lowliest position in the land. Now, out of the night, an angel appears to them. They're terrified. - [Angel] Don't be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy. Today, in the town of David, a savior has been born to you. (inspirational music) - [Narrator] Now a star of stunning brilliance draws three magi from the east to David's city. It is from Saba that these three magi began their starlit way to Bethlehem. They are men with knowledge of ancient Hebrew prophesies of the promised Messiah. And these men of great minds, and wisdom, and possibly great wealth, come humbly to the Christ child. They worship him and offer gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. (women vocalizing) Through the magi, Herod, king of Judea, half mad and wracked with disease, learns of the birth of Jesus. And he also learns of the 700-year-old prophecy of the prophet Mica. - [God] Bethlehem, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel. - [Narrator] Herod will brook no rivals. - [Angel] Joseph, get up! - [Narrator] As he sleeps, an angel appears to Joseph in a dream. - [Angel] Get up. Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him. - [Narrator] The child must die. Now death's shadow hovers over him, and he will never leave. Already he is a refugee in a family of refugees. (men yelling) (dramatic music) In a rage, Herod commands that all the male children of Bethlehem two years and under be slaughtered. (women shrieking) - [Narrator] Jesus is carried to safety into Egypt. - [God] Egypt will be blessed by the Lord. - [Narrator] Because of their kindness to the sons of Jacob, God looks with favor upon Egypt. And now Egypt is a sanctuary for the Messiah. (dramatic music) The ruler who ordered the slaughter of the newborn of Bethlehem, Herod the Great. As a young man, this half-breed, Herod, is more pagan than Jew. His appetites for intrigue, luxury, and pretty women scandalized Judea. He ingratiates himself with Caesar Augustus, who sits him on a throne as his vassal. Herod becomes king of the Jews. Despite his royal debauchery, he inaugurates a splendiferous building program. Under his scepter, Jerusalem becomes one of the most magnificent cities in the world. His rebuilding of the Temple would cause Solomon himself to be envious. Now, this vassal king lies close to death. Soon Herod the Great is dead. With Herod's death, an angel appears and commands Joseph. - [Angel] Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel. - [Narrator] Heading north, they skirt Bethlehem and Jerusalem. Now, Judea is ruled by Herod's son, another puppet of the Romans. The family goes further north, to the district of Galilee, safer perhaps, and fertile. (gentle music) But Galilee is not a part of the Jewish homeland. Jews of Jerusalem look down on Galileans. There are many gentiles among them. Galileans are second-class citizens. Joseph settles his family in Nazareth, in Galilee, a backward town held in such low esteem that later the apostle Nathaniel will ask. - [Nathaniel] Can anything good come out of Nazareth? - [Narrator] This church, the Church of Saint Joseph, stands on the site of the family's living quarters. Jesus grows up here. Here, Joseph teaches him the skills of his trade. (metal scraping) And here, in Nazareth, Jesus studies the Torah and the words of the prophets. The feast of the Passover. Lambs are chosen for the Paschal supper. It is the week when pilgrims pour into the city from three continents. Multitudes choke Jerusalem's twisted streets. Now Mary is near panic, as she and Joseph elbow through the crowd searching for their 12-year-old. He's missing, lost. They seek him among kinfolk, everywhere. After three days, they stumble upon him engaged in a question and answer session with learned doctors of the law. When Mary and Joseph ask him what he's been doing, his answer is that he is about his father's business. This is the River Jordan. In the time of Jesus, one who shuns the goods and glare of this world, a man on fire for God, is John, John the Baptist. John, the same age as Jesus, had come into the world to blaze the way for the Messiah. - [John] Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near! - [Narrator] Clad in camel's hide, and nurtured on locusts and wild honey, John immerses those who repent as the priests of the Temple are immersed that they may be clean in the eyes of God. John knows that he is the forerunner of the promised Messiah, so when Jesus comes to him, there is immediate recognition. - [John] I need to be baptized by you. And do you come to me? - [Jesus] Let it be so, now. (gentle music) - [Narrator] The heavens open, and the Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus in the form of a dove. - [God] This is my son, whom I love. With him, I am well pleased. - [Narrator] Jericho, a city going back some 10,000 years. Modern Jericho is a sleepy town with a population of about 7,000. From the wilderness, skirting Jericho, rises the Mount of Temptation. After his baptism by John, it is here that Jesus comes. The heavens had opened, had spoken. Now, Jesus seeks solitude. He retreats into this wilderness of Judea to be alone with his God, to contemplate his ministry. The sun is scorching. Nights are raw, bitter. He is beset by wild creatures. Days become weeks. Now he is no longer alone. He is attacked spiritually. Again and again, he is assaulted by the adversary, Ha-Satan in Hebrew, Satan in whatever form. (dramatic music) Satan knows well the prophecy that Jesus is setting in motion, and he rallies all the forces of Hell to halt it. Without food for weeks, Jesus is famished. - [Satan] Hungry? If you are the son of God, tell these stones to become bread. - [Jesus] Man does not live on bread alone. - [Narrator] Satan attacks again viciously, striking at his God sentedness. He takes Jesus up, up into the holy city, and has him stand dizzily on the Temple's highest point and urges him to jump. - [Satan] Throw yourself down. For it is written, He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands. - [Jesus] It is also written, do not put the Lord your God to the test. - [Narrator] Satan leads Jesus up a high mountain and points out all the kingdoms of this world. - [Satan] All this I will give you, if you will bow down and worship me. - [Jesus] Away from me, Satan. For it is written, worship the Lord your God, and serve him only. - [Narrator] Jesus will not yield nor compromise. After 40 days and 40 nights, Jesus comes out of the wilderness. He takes the Jericho road back to his home province of Galilee. There he will proclaim the kingdom of God. Again, he is in Nazareth, the place where he grew up. There he will begin his ministry by preaching in a place familiar to him, the synagogue. Jesus performs his duty. He takes his turn to read to the congregation, with great authority, from the prophet Isaiah. - [Jesus] The spirit of the Lord is on me. Because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the captives, recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. - [Narrator] He has read Isaiah's words to mean that the spirit of the Lord is upon him, that the Lord had anointed him. His listeners are enraged. They take him to a ledge over a steep on this hill. Here they crowd around him, intending to hurl him headlong over the edge. But he passes through their ranks and walks away. Abounding in fish, this body of water in the Jordan Valley called Yam Kinneret in Hebrew, and Lake Tiberius by the Romans, is the Sea of Galilee. (gentle music) - [Jesus] Follow me. - [Narrator] Forced out of Nazareth, Jesus comes upon two fishermen, brothers, and bids them. - [Jesus] Come, follow me. Follow me and I will make you fishers of men. - [Narrator] Perhaps Andrew and his brother, Simon Peter, aren't fully aware of what draws them so suddenly to Jesus. Jesus doesn't seem to be anyone special. He isn't wealthy. He was born of a local Jewish couple. They will soon learn. Jesus goes to another boat, where the sons of Zebedee, James and John, are mending their nets. - [Jesus] Follow me. - [Narrator] And they follow, without question, to trail after him wherever he goes, to live with him, for him. This is discipleship. And thus, Jesus gathers his disciples. (uplifting music) In a place called Cana, this church stands where a wedding took place, a wedding attended by Jesus, his mother, and his disciples. It's a joyous affair, family, feasting, wine. (people cheering) Until the wine runs out, causing much embarrassment for the host. Here, Jesus performs a miracle, his first. (water pattering) (people chattering) Tradition says that in this vessel, Jesus changed that water into wine. When Jesus leaves the feast, only a few realize that a miracle has been done. For Jesus, time had not yet arrived. Then he came here, to this place, Capernaum. (gentle music) The town of Capernaum is a special place for Jesus, a place where he preaches repentance, and a place he curses when this city, which he feels is his city, fails to heed him. These ruins date from the 5th century after Christ. But beneath them is a house from the time of Jesus. Some believe that it is the house of Simon Peter where Jesus often stayed, where he took meals, rested, prayed. Once, in that house, Peter's mother-in-law lay wracked with fever. Jesus takes her by the hand and lifts her up, and the fever leaves her. Now Jesus has shown that he is a healer. No disease festers in human history as does leprosy. Unclean, that is how the leper thinks of himself, feels about himself. A leper approaches and begs Jesus to heal him. For years he has not felt the touch of a human hand. Jesus reaches out and touches his flesh. - [Jesus] Be cleansed. - [Narrator] The leper is cured, and Jesus tells him to say nothing of this to anyone. But his fame grows as he travels from place to place, reaching out to everyone, working people, street people, outcasts, preaching, forgiving sins, and gathering more apostles until their numbers is 12, like the 12 tribes of Israel. In any case, the lame and the sick trail after him, clamoring to be cured. (gentle music) At his Capernaum headquarters, he chooses 12 of his disciples as apostles. Simon, whom he calls Peter, and his brother, Andrew. The Zebedee brothers, James and John, whom he calls the sons of thunder. Philip and his friend Bartholomew. Matthew, who had been a tax collector. Thomas, who happen to be a twin. Another James, and a Judas Thaddeus. Simon, a revolutionary, and Judas Iscariot, who kept track of the money donations they received. He teaches with divine authority and with deeply felt humanity. - [Jesus] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. - [Narrator] A church now stands atop the mount where he proclaimed a new covenant written not upon stone tablets, but upon the human heart. - [Jesus] Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. - [Narrator] In the same Sermon on the Mount, he taught that in prayer we can address the creator of this vast universe, the source of life from the atom to the farthest galaxy as Abba, which is as warm and familiar as our word, Papa. Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever, amen. It is not out of the law that Jesus makes his claims. Jesus is his own authority, and this makes him enemies. By breaking with their traditions, later incorporated into the Talmud, now his enemies are surveying the ground upon which to accuse him. (people chattering) They soon find it. The ruins of a pool called Bethesda. (dramatic music) Invalids, the lame, and the blind swarm here and make their way to the pool whose waters they hope desperately will cure them. This man has been an invalid for 38 years. After so long, he has given up all hope of ever getting well. He is startled when Jesus asks. - [Jesus] Do you want to get well? - [Narrator] Rather than answering, the man blames his hardship on the neglect of others and bemoans his state of helplessness. Jesus' reply is brief and to the point. - [Jesus] Pick up your mat and walk. - [Man] Yah, it is the Sabbath! - [Narrator] There's no rejoicing among the Pharisees witnessing this, a man carrying his mat on the Sabbath. They're angry. They cannot fathom that God hath given the Sabbath simply as a day for men and women to rest from their labors. Their own legalism has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts to what they've just witnessed. In contrast, Jesus loves the man he's healed, a man who tells others of the miraculous happening. Jesus had given him not only the gift of physical wellness, but of spiritual wholeness as well. The outraged want to stone him. - [Man] He called God his father. - [Man] He claims he's equal with God. - [Man] Sabbath violator. - [Man] Destroyer of the law. - [Jesus] My father is always at his work. And I too am working. - [Narrator] Jesus had not come to break the law, but to fulfill it. An outcast celebrity, he seeks solitude on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. And not far behind the multitudes follow him, the curious and the cripples, the cynical and the sincere. It is near the Galilean town of Tabgha that a multitude gathers to hear Jesus preach. In time, the crowd is famished. The only food, two small fish and five pieces of bread. Miraculously, Jesus makes this food feed 5,000 hungry people. Jesus tells the crowd that Moses had also given them bread and filled their bodily needs. In their journey from Egypt, that miraculous manna vanished when they passed into the land of Canaan. On this day, 5,000 hungry men, women, and children are fed. All are amazed at Jesus' endless bounty, his endless blessing. And when everyone has eaten, there is enough left over to fill 12 baskets. (gentle music) A church has been erected near the place where this miracle occurred. - [Jesus] I am the bread of life. He who comes to me, will never go hungry. (wind whooshing) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] They had arrived by boat, and they were returning by boat, Jesus and his disciples. A storm rages, yet Jesus remains asleep under a platform in the stern. His disciples are struggling to keep the pitching boat still. - [Disciple] Teacher, don't you care if we drown? - [Narrator] Jesus awakens and calms the storm. - [Jesus] Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith? - [Narrator] This is another time Jesus has shown the disciples his miraculous power over nature. More and more, they are realizing what an extraordinary man their teacher is. (gentle music) His claims are becoming more and more startling to those who hear him and more incriminating for his enemies. - [Man] Are you greater than our father Abraham? - [Jesus] Abraham saw my day and rejoiced. I tell you the truth. Before Abraham was born, I am. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] He continues working miracles, sometimes to inspire faith, sometimes to emphasize his teaching that the kingdom of God is coming through him, and often out of simple pity for those suffering. These are the remains of the Pool of Siloam. Here, Jesus encounters a man born blind. With his saliva and some mud, Jesus makes a paste and applies it to the man's sightless eyes. Then Jesus tells him to wash in the Pool of Siloam. (water splashing) Without questioning, the man obeys. And for the first time in his life, he sees. He sees light. - [Jesus] While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. - [Narrator] Seeing Jesus, the man worships him. (dramatic music) Again, he demonstrates his command over nature. His disciples are by themselves on the Sea of Galilee, rowing hard against a storm. Then they see a figure moving over the water. A ghost walking on the sea, they're terrified. - [Jesus] It is I, don't be afraid. - [Narrator] He climbs into the boat. The sea is calm again. (birds squawking) Again, he fills his apostles with sudden awe. In some ways, he is still a stranger to them. Who is he really? (dramatic music) His enemies are hissing the same question. He threatens their pale power, so he must be done away with. They revile him for associating with sinners and forgiving them their sins. But the people, widows, orphans, publicans, the dispossessed, the diseased, physically, mentally, or spiritually, some hungry for attention, some thirsting for truth, the people love him. From them, Jesus asks faith. From him, they want miracles. (dramatic music) He does more than calm the tempest and cure the sick. He meets face-to-face the demons ensnaring men's minds. - [Demon] What do you want with me, Jesus? Son of the most high God. - [Jesus] What is your name? - [Demon] My name is Legion, for we are many. - [Jesus] Go. - [Narrator] The demons are driven into a herd of pigs who plunge headlong down the steep into a lake, where they drown. What is most awesome is his power over life and death. Yesterday, Jairus' daughter had been singing and laughing. Today, she is dead. - [Jesus] Little girl, I say to you, get up. (gentle music) - [Narrator] He had reached into death and drew her back into life. Radically, for a Jew of his time, Jesus reaches beyond the Jewish people to a Roman centurion, an officer, a commander of other men. Through Jewish elders, this Roman implores Jesus to restore the health of his dying servant. This proud Roman says. - [Centurion] Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof, but say the word, and my servant will be healed. - [Narrator] Without entering the centurion's house, Jesus makes the servant well again. Of the Roman, he says. - [Jesus] I tell you, I have not found such great faith, even in Israel. - [Narrator] The time comes when he reveals himself fully to those closest to him, to Simon Peter, who has confessed he believes Jesus to be the son of God. (gentle music) Tradition says this is Mount Tabor in Galilee. The event that took place, many believe, on these heights is commemorated by the Church of the Transfiguration and by this statue of Elijah. Up these slopes, Jesus leads Peter, and James, and John to a place where they might pray. They do not know what awaits them. Simon Peter falls asleep. So do James and John. Jesus is transfigured. - [Woman] His face changes. And his clothes become as bright as a flash of lightening. - [Narrator] Jesus is not alone. Moses and the prophet Elijah appear in glorious splendor, and Jesus talks with them. Then a cloud envelops them, and a voice is heard. - [God] This is my son whom I love. With him, I am well pleased. Listen to him. - [Narrator] Now Jesus is alone. Everything is as it had been. He goes back into the gritty, everyday world. When teaching in the temple, Jesus is frequently beset by hostile Pharisees bent on trapping him. Once in his presence, these enemies thrust a woman into a circle of men who mean to stone her. (woman moaning) She had been caught in adultery, in the very act. The law of Moses commands her stoning. Wanting to trap him, they ask Jesus. - [Pharisee] What do you say? - [Narrator] At first, Jesus is silent. If he replies, release her, he is condoning the breaking of Mosaic law. If he says, stone her, he is without compassion. At last, he speaks. - [Jesus] If any one of you is without sin, let him to be the first to throw a stone at her. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] When Jesus asks the woman if anyone has condemned her she answers. - [Woman] No one, sir. - [Jesus] Then neither do I condemn you. Go now, and leave your life of sin. - [Narrator] For three years, Jesus had brought God to mankind. Now the time has come when he must bring mankind to God. The sacrifice, for which he came into the world, must be fulfilled. Jesus is the perfect sacrifice, the lamb of God, committed to doing his father's will even unto death. (dramatic music) For the last time, he sets out for Jerusalem, the city of God. A sacred tapestry woven of the threads of history from the lengths of antiquity to the knotty strands of its unpredictable future, this is the Holy City set among golden hills. Throughout time, it has been under siege again and again, conquered again and again. It's name means city of peace. It is the city where Kind David, 1,000 years before Christ was born, built an altar to the Ark of the Covenant. It is said that the world has 10 measures of beauty of which nine belong to Jerusalem. It is the city of eight gates, and no other city on Earth so stirs the blood and fires the imagination. In traveling from Galilee to the Holy City, he passes through Samaria. (gentle music) Samaria. Today Samaritans are remembered because of Jesus' parable. Good Samaritan has become part of our everyday speech, but in Jesus' time, Samaritan was tantamount to despised outcast. On the outskirts of Nablus, Samaria's largest city, is the place where the patriarch Jacob, Abraham's grandson, pitched his tents. This church is built over Jacob's ancient well. It is at Jacob's Well that Jesus, thirsty and tired on his journey to Jerusalem, stops to rest. - [Woman] It's noon. People are staying in their houses to avoid the midday heat. A Samaritan woman, a woman with a history of casual relationships with men, comes to Jacob's Well to draw water. She lowers her eyes when she sees Jesus. Jesus asks. - [Jesus] Will you give me a drink? - [Woman] She's surprised and a bit suspicious, perhaps. Surprised that a Jew would ask a despised Samaritan for water, for anything. Usually they wouldn't even speak to them. - [Jesus] If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water. - [Woman] She takes Jesus to be a prophet. There are many things she doesn't understand, but then when the Messiah comes, he will explain everything to us. - [Narrator] And Jesus says. - [Jesus] I who speak to you, am he. - [Narrator] But can this woman grasp what awaits the Messiah in Jerusalem? (dramatic music) In the company of his disciples, and with the dire prediction of his death, he turns his face towards Jerusalem for the last time. (dramatic music) The first leg of the journey takes them through Jericho, believed to be the oldest city in the world. Being the oldest city in the world, today's Jericho continues to be the site of archeological exploration. It's an oasis in the barren valley of the lower Jordan. Here in Jericho, people have heard much of Jesus the healer. A crowd surges after him. - [Woman] Jesus of Nazareth is here! - [Man] Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. - [Woman] Be quiet! - [Man] Son of David, have mercy on me! - [Narrator] It is a blind beggar reaching out to Jesus. Because of his faith, Jesus restores his sight. On this last journey to Jerusalem, Jesus stops at Bethany, on the outskirts of the city. This church stands on the site of the house of Lazarus and his sisters, Martha and Mary. Lazarus had been ill. By the time Jesus got to Bethany, he had been dead for four days. As is the custom, Lazarus' body is washed then embalmed with ointments and perfumes. Lazarus' sisters, Martha and Mary, had torn their garments and covered all their mirrors. They are in seven days of mourning. It is Martha who greets Jesus. - [Martha] If you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. - [Jesus] Your brother will rise again. - [Martha] I know he will rise again in the Resurrection at the last day. - [Jesus] I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live even though he dies. And whoever lives and believes in me will never die. - [Man] Take away the stone. (stone rumbling) - [Narrator] These steps lead to the actual tomb where Lazarus lay dead. - [Jesus] Lazarus, come out. - [Narrator] The dead man rises. He is bound with grave clothes. But he is alive. In raising Lazarus, Jesus offers proof of his words to Martha, I am the Resurrection. (dramatic music) The raising of Lazarus sets off a wildfire of talk. Jesus is winning more and more followers among the prominent, among the leaders. The chief priests and the high priest, Caiaphas, convene a council. What are they to do? If they let Jesus be, the whole nation will follow him. Rome will get into it. Rome will punish the whole nation because of this Jesus. It is better that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish. Jesus is a wanted man. His name may be posted in public places, condemned. He's no longer free to wander among the Jews. The temple guards have orders to arrest him on sight, so he and his disciples go into hiding, into the wilderness. It is the 10th day of the Hebrew month of Nissan, when the lambs for sacrifice are set aside. (lambs baaing) Jesus bravely sets out for Jerusalem, and his disciples risk following there for the Passover is at hand. Despite being a religious outcast, his coming draws huge crowds. Looking down from the Mount of Olives, you can see the route he takes as he rides into the city. - [Woman] Hosannah! - [Man] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! - [Narrator] His reception, as he enters through its golden gate is stupendous. (crowd cheering) - [Man] Blessed is thee who cometh. - [Narrator] The hopeful, the cheerers, the grateful, and the gawkers are waving palms. They even hail him as a king. A king! - [Man] Blessed is thee who cometh. - [Narrator] Politically this is a dangerous reception in a land ruled by Romans. Were it not for the adoring crowds surrounding him, he would have been arrested then and there. (gentle music) (dramatic music) This lovely tear-shaped church is called Dominus Flevit, which means the Lord wept, for it commemorates what Jesus feels as he pauses to gaze at Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives. He sees the entire city before him, the palaces and towers, the valleys and hills. He loves this city. But seeing it now, he weeps. Terrible suffering lay ahead of him, and he knows this for it had been foretold by the prophet Isaiah 700 years before. - [Woman] The Lord has laid on him the iniquity if us all. - [Narrator] Jesus does not weep for what lay ahead for him. He weeps for Jerusalem because he foresees a time when this city will be destroyed and left with not one stone standing on another. (people screaming) (trumpet blaring) - [Narrator] It is the Monday of Passover week. Jews from everywhere keep pouring into the city, heady with a kind of spiritual excitement. Already pillars of smoke are rising from the altars at the temple. This day, risking arrest, Jesus goes to the temple to teach. (uplifting music) Little more remains of the temple that Jesus knew other than this masonry, this western wall of massive stone blocks, rising to a height of 55 feet. Jerusalem's temples had always crowned Mount Moriah. And it is this temple that Jesus compares with his own body when he says. - [Jesus] Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Though the guards are on the watch for him, on Monday morning, Jesus goes openly to the temple which he regards as his father's house. He teaches in the court of gentiles, but he's appalled by the way it's been commercialized. It's a market. (people chattering) Foreign coins being exchanged for temple currency with which to buy lambs and doves for sacrifice. He is here to call people to their prophetic faith, but here, piety is being turned into profit. - [Jesus] My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations, but you have made it a den of robbers. (dramatic music) (wood crashing) - [Narrator] He drives out the money changers, bodily. Before astonished pilgrims, he overturns cash tables fearlessly and with great authority. His father has been insulted, and he is furious. (people chattering) - [Man] For the sake of our children. (dramatic music) And he has the audacity to remain, to heal the blind and the maimed. While the temple guards are held back like dogs on a leash, the authorities are afraid to have him arrested, afraid of riots. To the masses of people crowding into Jerusalem, Jesus is a hero. Common people hang on every word he utters, so the authorities bide their time. That night, Jesus returns to Bethany. (dramatic music) Under cover of darkness, one of the 12 secretly contacts the temple guard captain, who takes him to the priests. He offers to alert them at the first opportunity when Jesus is alone and vulnerable, so that he can be arrested without rioting from the masses. A purse is given, 30 pieces of silver. Thursday of the Passover, Jesus sends two into the city. There, he says, they are to look for a man carrying a water pot, an unusual sign because in Jesus' day, men never carried water pots. Women did this work. Follow him. Enter the house that he goes into. Find the owner of the house and tell him, my master says. - [Jesus] My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house. - [Narrator] This is how the arrangements are made for the supper. (gentle music) Many believe that this is the site of the Cenacle of the Last Supper. This rambling, old building holds what is believed to be King David's tomb as well. This is the upper room, the Cenacle, where the supper begins. - [Jesus] I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Here, Jesus and his chosen 12 partake of lamb roasted on a spit of pomegranate wood, (men chattering) of roasted eggs, bitter herbs, unleavened bread. To the 12, Jesus is their teacher, their rabbi. As his learners, which is what the word disciple means, they attend to their teacher's every need. But something they are never expected to do is to wash their teacher's feet. Yet while they daydream of high places in the coming kingdom, Jesus assumes the place of a lowly servant. He washes their feet. - [Jesus] Blessed art thou, oh Lord, our God, King of the universe. (inspirational music) - [Narrator] During this supper, Jesus takes bread and breaks it. - [Jesus] Take and eat. This is my body. - [Narrator] Then he blesses a cup of wine. - [Jesus] Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant. - [Narrator] He shocks them when he foretells that one of their number will betray him. (men chattering) - [Narrator] Judas quietly slips away. With the 11 who remain, Jesus shares his deepest thoughts. He will suffer, but be exalted. His greatest humiliation will be the hour of his glory. Now he foretells that Simon Peter will deny him before the cock crows. (men chattering) (gentle music) - [Narrator] This is Gethsemane, then as now a lovely garden. Here stand olive trees so gnarled with age that they may have been saplings when Jesus came here to pray. Here his chosen felt drowsy, while he felt agony. Overlooking Gethsemane today is the Church of All Nations. The facade is graced with Byzantine-style mosaics. Its 12 domes stand for the 12 nations that contributed to its construction. It holds what is believed to be the rock at which Jesus prayed in his agony in the garden. (crickets chirring) (fire crackling) That Thursday night, after the Passover meal, Jesus comes here with the 11. They are sleepy, and he implores them to stay awake, to keep watch with him, but they keep dosing off. (dramatic music) Here in this lovely grove, Jesus is stung by the dread of what is to come, by an inner agony. Wandering further into the garden, his heart is near to bursting with grief. - [Jesus] Abba, Father, take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will. - [Narrator] His work is coming to an end, and he is giving all that the Father asks of him. Out of the darkness, Judas Iscariot appears. Judas kisses him, identifying him. - [Judas] Master. - [Narrator] And a band of temple guards grab him. (men yelling) - [Jesus] Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the scriptures must be fulfilled. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] They lead him away, a prisoner. (men chattering) Peter follows his master at a distance as the guards march Jesus to the house of the high priest. (gentle music) (women vocalizing) This is St. Peter's Church in Jerusalem. It's a reminder that just a few hours before the arrest was made in Gethsemane, Jesus had warned. - [Jesus] It is written. I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered. - [Narrator] Peter had protested. - [Peter] Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you. - [Jesus] Simon Peter, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) - [Narrator] He waits in the courtyard, huddling around a warming fire with some servants, while Jesus' words haunt him. - [Jesus] Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times. - [Narrator] A servant woman stares at him through the firelight. - [Servant Woman] You! You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus. - [Peter] I don't know or understand what you're talking about. - [Servant Woman] This fellow was one of them. - [Peter] I am not. - [Woman] Surely you're one of them. You're a Galilean. - [Peter] I don't know this man you're talking about. (rooster crows) - [Narrator] Peter breaks down and weeps. (dramatic music) The rooster's crow sounds the beginning of one of the strangest trials in the history of humankind. They want him dead, the chief priests, the high priest himself. Caiaphas, the high priest, has hurriedly summoned these priests from their homes and beds to condemn this outlaw. Caiaphas asks bluntly. - [Caiaphas] Are you the Christ? The son of the blessed one? - [Narrator] And Jesus answers. - [Jesus] I am. - [Narrator] Blasphemy, cries the high priest. You all heard him say it. What do you think? And they condemn him as worthy of death. The clamor for Jesus' death increases, and Judas, repenting his betrayal, hangs himself. It is early Friday morning. The emergency council of priests has pronounced a death sentence it has no power to carry out. This power is firmly invested in the Roman procurator, so the condemned is hurried to the house of Pontius Pilate. Their ploy is to paint Jesus as a threat to Rome. - [Man] He urges our people not to pay their taxes to Rome. He claims to be our Messiah, a king! - [Pilate] Are you king of the Jews? - [Jesus] Yes. It is as you say. - [Pilate] I find no basis for a charge against this man. - [Narrator] Pilate is reluctant. He doesn't want to meddle in the Jews' religious squabbles. When Pilate learns that Jesus is a Galilean, he squirms out of the situation, he thinks. He refers the case to Rome's man in Galilee, the tetrarch, Herod Antipas, who is in Jerusalem for Passover. Jesus? The tetrarch is eager to get a look. He's heard all sorts of stories about this Jesus. He had hoped to see him perform some miracle. But Jesus remains silent, and this infuriates Herod Antipas. He mocks this self-proclaimed king. He drapes him in a royal robe and has him shunted back to Pilate. Pilate's wife is convinced that this Jesus is innocent. She's been told so in a dream. And the governor himself informs the chief priests that after examination, he finds the prisoner guiltless of any crime against the Roman government. (dramatic music) The Fortress of Antonia. This is the way it looked during the time of Jesus. A Hasmonean fort rebuilt by Herod the Great. Today, the Church of the Sisters of Zion aroofs the fort's pavement on which Pontius Pilate judged Jesus. Here incised in a paving stone is a game of kings, a gambling pastime popular with the Roman troops. Now, at the insistence of the priests, Jesus is being led to Pilate's judgment seat for a second time. It is a custom here for the Roman procurator to free a condemned criminal in honor of the Passover. It's a mindless mob he faces, orchestrated to shout what they've been told. (crowd shouting) - [Crowd] Release our Christ. Release our Christ. Release our Christ. - [Pilate] Shall I crucify your king? - [Man] We have no king but Caesar. - [Man] We have no king but Caesar. - [Narrator] The mob keeps hammering, free Barabbas and crucify Jesus. To avoid a riot and a possible bad report to the emperor, Pilate orders the execution and tries to wash his hands of the whole affair. Jesus is turned over to the rough Roman guards for flogging. (whip cracking) Before these roughnecks are through, they're having sport with this joke of a king, forcing a hastily made crown of thorns onto his head. (ominous music) He is made to drag the instrument of his execution, a heavy cross, through these streets. Each crushing fall to the paving stones, each agony is forged into our memory. At Eastertime, Christians from all over the Earth are drawn to these dark, narrow lanes to bear their own crosses over the cobble, worn smooth by centuries of pilgrims, to walk where he walked to the last, in the knowledge that it is they, humankind, who are responsible for his death. Now the 700-year-old prophecy of Isaiah. - [Woman] He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter. - [Narrator] Many believe that this is the place of execution, this hill, Calvary, in Hebrew, Golgotha, the place of the skull. (dramatic music) Roman law orders crucifixion for non-Romans and slaves, and then, only for the most terrible of crimes. It is the most agonizing form of execution known to Romans. A signboard is fixed on the cross announcing in Latin, and Greek, and Aramaic, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. - [Jesus] Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. - [Narrator] Mary Magdalene and other women are standing near the cross. (dramatic music) Men in the military are given to gambling, and these Romans, no exception, are now throwing dice for Jesus' clothes (laughing) while others stand around joking. - [Man] Come down from that cross if you are the son of God. - [Narrator] That morning, two criminals, thieves, are crucified as well, one on either side of Jesus. One of them scoffs. - [Thief] Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us. - [Narrator] The other confesses that the two of them deserve this death but that Jesus is innocent. - [Thief] Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. - [Jesus] Today, you will be with me in paradise. - [Narrator] Though it is only noon, the sky begins to darken as though night were falling. (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? The mockers and gawkers think he has called on the prophet Elijah. (dramatic music) - [Jesus] I'm thirsty. - [Narrator] When Jesus calls for water, they tried to force on him sour wine. (thunder rumbling) (lightning cracking) - [Narrator] At about three that afternoon, Jesus bows his head and breathes his last. - [Jesus] Father, into your hands I commit my spirit. - [Narrator] A storm rages. (thunder rumbling) The earth shakes. And the curtain shielding the Holy of Holies of the temple is torn in two. A Roman soldier pierces the corpse with a spear. Blood gushes out and water. The Roman officer in charge of the execution, a centurion, comments. - [Centurion] Surely this man was the son of God. - [Narrator] 700 years before this event, it was prophesied. - [Woman] He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace, was upon him. And by his wounds are we healed. - [Narrator] There is in the Kindron Valley of Jerusalem, a communal grave for paupers. Jesus owned nothing. It seems possible that his corpse might have been flung into a pauper's grave, but the prophets foresaw that it would be otherwise. A rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, a secret disciple, summons all his courage and goes to Pilate and pleads for custody of the body. Pilate gives in. Again, Isaiah's 700-year-old prophecy is being fulfilled. - [Woman] He was assigned a grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death. - [Narrator] The tomb that Joseph of Arimathea offers is newly hewn out of rock. (dramatic music) As with Lazarus, Jesus must be entombed shortly after death. Today, particularly, there's no time to tarry. It's Friday. Sundown marks the beginning of the Sabbath. Joseph and the other followers carry the corpse to Joseph's family tomb. This church was built in the 12th century by Crusaders. The first church to stand here had been built by the Emperor Constantine in the 4th century. It is the final station of the Way of the Cross, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Millions are certain that it holds the tomb where Jesus was laid. During Jesus' lifetime, this was indeed an area of tombs, and the belief that this is the authentic tomb goes back as far as the 1st century. A later discovery is this sepulchre, now known as the garden tomb, near a scull-shaped rock. Many believe that it is here that Jesus was entombed. What we know for certain is that the place was in a garden and near Golgotha. A great stone is rolled across the entrance, and the tomb is sealed at the demand of the priests. (gentle music) But they are taking no chances. Guards are posted. The first night of the first day, the night of the Sabbath, is markedly uneventful. The second day is increasingly tedious and hot. But the night is chilly. Then, the dawn of the third day. As the new day dawns, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary are on their way to the tomb. They're fretting. How can they roll aside the huge stone at the entrance, so that they can embalm the body with the ointments they've brought? Something is wrong. The stone has been rolled away. The Roman seal is broken. The tomb is empty. - [Woman] Do not be afraid for I know you are looking for Jesus. He is not here. He has risen. (footsteps thudding) - [Narrator] The women flee, frightened but bursting with joy. Suddenly, Jesus is there in front of them. Jesus shows himself first to the women, the Magdalene. They had been steadfast throughout his ordeal, while his disciples hid themselves and despaired. Though the temple priests claim that the body has been stolen, news spreads of the Resurrection. (people cheering) (gentle music) Galilee. A church stands over the place where Jesus meets with these closest disciples, apostles for the last time. Here the 11 await him. They wait. At last Peter says. - [Peter] I'm going out to fish. - [Narrator] By dawn, they are on the water, fishing from a boat. Day breaks. They find themselves squinting at someone on the beach. - [Jesus] Haven't you any fish? - [Man] No! - [Jesus] Throw your net on the right. (water splashing) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] There are so many fish that they can hardly draw in the net. John straining his eyes trying to make out who the stranger is. Suddenly he shouts. - [John] It is the Lord! - [Narrator] Peter plunges into the water and swims for shore. The others stay in the boat, pulling the net to land. Over a small fire, they share a breakfast of bread and the freshly caught fish with Jesus. Now his ministry rests on them. Jesus entrusts them with his work. - [Jesus] As the Father has sent me, I am sending you. (gentle music) - [Narrator] Many believe that it is from here, the ground that this church is built on, that Jesus was taken up into heaven with a promise to return to this land, where he walked some 2,000 years ago. - [Woman] And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. - [Narrator] Of all the Earth God chose this plot of land, this spiritual bridge joining the worlds of Asia, of Africa, of Europe. This is the land God promised, and God chose these people, and spoke through their prophets. When Jesus walked this land, he never went beyond 100 miles from Nazareth. Yet for 2,000 years, he has walked with men and women from the farthest corners of the Earth. - [Jesus] I am with you always, to the very end of the age.
