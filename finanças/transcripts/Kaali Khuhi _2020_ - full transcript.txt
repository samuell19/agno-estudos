Let's go, Shivangi Here, take this. Here! Where were you, Darshan? We waited forever in this heat. You should have told me you weren't coming. We were waiting for so long. Shivangi, why are you making a mess? Listen. I haven’t told her anything yet. I thought it would be best if you did, Don't get into the details. She's a kid. Fine, go pack. Let's leave. Pack? What do you mean? You're supposed to go alone. Why are you involving me? That's my mother. Exactly… yours. -Come Shivangi. -Wait. Come here, child. Where are we going, papa? Child.

My mother's sick Priya! Mama. Mama! I need to pee. Darshan, pull over. Darshan, pull over on the side here. Shivangi! Let's go! It's been so long since the three of us have traveled together. Idiot! -Darshan, you've come. -Auntie! Is that Shivangi? She has grown up. It's been so long. It was pouring. It was late and thundering. I don't know why… I felt the need to come and check. Shivangi, change into your pajamas. No, let her stay! Can you go and check if Twinkle is asleep? Our buffalo. She had such long hair, you cut it so short. But I guess she's a city girl. She was lying on the floor when I came. Thank God, she was breathing. I picked her up. The doctor said to take her to the hospital. -But you know how she is. -Yes, we all know how she is. But you should've taken her to the hospital. You could have... if you'd been here. She doesn't listen to me. Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! -Oh! -Auntie! Chandni, quiet! They arrived very late last night. Is Shivangi here? Yes, but you're going to wake her up with your yelling. Go! I’m awake. Shivangi, this is Chandni. You two used to play together. Remember? Go play. Do you remember me? Kind of.. Not much, but I've seen your photos. Come in, I need to change first. Come on, no one cares. You know, only Auntie calls me Chandni. Everyone else calls me Baby. I'll show you around the village. This is one of my favorite places. Come, let's go up. Can you open it? Why don't you stay at Auntie's place? But you can come to my grandma's house too. So are you gonna stay at that house? Yes. Why? It's a strange house. Strange? Why? That's my grandma's house. Yes. Looks like it's going to rain. We should leave. Come let's go to Grandma's house. No, you come to my house. Come! Do you like ghost stories? Come, I'll tell you one. -Where is everyone? -What do you mean? I mean your mom and dad?

Today, another girl in the village saw a spirit. A wandering spirit. Spirit? Don't interrupt! The whole village was cursed. Everyday there was a death. Some had died. And some were waiting to die. Come let's play. Why is your face covered? The whole village is getting sick. Don't be afraid. Come. You should leave now. Why? Who's that? Why are you running? There was only one place where she could go. A place with no life. Why are you still here? Go! Leave! Save yourself What are you doing here? Leave. And don't you dare come back. I have looked into those same eyes. You never listen to me, do you? How many times have I told you not to do that? Out. Get out! Go to the kitchen! Shivangi, go home! Your parents must be waiting for you. Go! Everything will be fine. Don't cry! No… nothing will be fine. You… know nothing. Leave! Go! Papa. She's sleeping. She'll be fine. Eat something. -Darshan. -I'm not hungry. You haven't eaten since yesterday. I won't leave my mother alone. Come, eat. I won't let Shivangi go either. Shivangi! That's mine… Give it to me!

Do you need something? -Everything okay? -Looks like it. She needs something, why aren't you helping her? Why don't you ask her yourself? It's nothing. Tea? There you are. Go. Get me some water. Go. Go, sit. What a hypocrite. I'm sick because of you. Because you failed to give me a grandson. If only you had taken that medicine I gave you. Instead, you burdened my son by giving him a daughter. If not my son, you can at least think of your daughter Every girl needs a brother. You want everything your way. Your job, your house. For generations, we've given this medicine to give birth to boys. But you want to do things your way. Mama! Darshan! Darshan! Darshan! Darshan! Hurry! Someone help! Auntie! Sit down!

Open the door, Auntie! I want that photo, Auntie! Open the door, Auntie! Open the door! Shivangi! Satya Auntie. Auntie! Auntie! Your book! Auntie! Auntie! Your book! Auntie! Give it! What's going on, Auntie? What is this? My stories… Yours? Real stories? Yes… Have you seen that girl? She’s a spirit… from the black well, Like… all of these girls. You're just a child... How will you understand? Many years ago… your grandmother was young then. Very happy, because of your father's birth. When Darshan turned five, your grandmother gave birth to a girl. A sweet little sparrow. Sakshi. But she never got to fly free. A tradition was cruelly carried on, by the elders of the village. She was swallowed by the well, like the other girls. When the elders died, I hid all their sins. I buried all the unfortunate souls, but… I don't know… now it's been opened. Where is the well? In our fields… Brother? I am Sakshi. What do you want? I made this for my little brother. Brothers don’t make tadaagis. But I've already made it. That way we can hear him, so he can always be protected. How are you so sure you're going to have a brother? But I turned out to be a sparrow (girl). I was just a little boy then. You forgot about me… and became one of them. No, I never forgot… I didn't have a choice. Now you do. Come with me. Papa! Papa! Papa! Can't you see the village is cursed? We're all going to die! This house is cursed. It's cursed. Mama! What is it? That girl… Papa… near the well… Papa is... gone. We need to leave right away. Auntie… please don't let anything happen to Shivangi. Chandni! What happened to you, child? Get out of the child! Take me! I will take you all! We're all going to die. We're all going to die… We have to go right away. My house… hurry! Hurry! Come on. Be brave. Be brave! Let go! Let go of me! Stop! Leave her! Let go! Put her in the closet! Open it! Shivangi, please save me! Shivangi. She's calling out to you. Do you hear her? Mama? She's coming for all of us. And she… wants my baby. You’re going to be a big sister. That's the reason she's calling for you. But… but why me? This tradition has been going on for ages. But it's evil. And must be stopped… You are the new generation. New thinking. She needs you, Shivangi. Shivangi! Shivangi, save me! Baby? No! I won't let you take her! I will save you! I will save you. Subtitle translation by:
