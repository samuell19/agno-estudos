Is it an avalanche? No. It is a herd of horses galloping. A Tsui Hark Film. Adapted from, Seven Swordsmen from Mountain Tian, by Liang Yu Sheng. Seven Swords. The Imperial Edict has decreed. The practise of Martial Arts is outlawed. Anyone who violates it. Will be punished by decapitation. We don't know each other. Why do you want to kill us all? For a simple reason. The Emperor's order is to kill all martial arts practitioners. Every head counts for a reward. Shut Up. The order also said that if we surrender our weapons. The punishment would be milder. The Emperor has to suppress all possible rebellion. Death is the mildest punishment. What about the aged? And the children? Three hundred pieces of silver per head. You're worth even more. How much can we make from this deal? Up to now, we've taken 173 33 are worth 1,000 pieces of silver. The others at 300 each. A total of 75,000 pieces of silver. I have to raise my prices. The targets get fewer and fewer. I am about to go out of business. The next target is... Same old way. If you know their names, put them on the plaques. Otherwise, just put whatever you like. What happened? Where are the plaques? I just put them on. The death-row plaques have been stolen. Find him. Is it him again? Do you want him dead or alive? Interesting. Did you see that? What do you mean? This person is good at martial arts. But he does not want to hurt anyone. Look. Little lady, have you seen an injured man? Looks like you've been trained in fighting. Is this man after you? Quick. You go. He is greedy. He won't let any one of us go free. Isn't that Yuanying? What are you doing? Water. Bandage. I have some bandages here. Yi Town is under attack. They are getting near. What did he say? What are these? Death-row plaques from the bodies. With the prisoners' names and offences. Not only martial arts practitioners, but innocent people are also executed. Go away. Dad. They are Fire-wind's army. Only three hundred miles away from here. They will be here soon. You have to run for your lives. Or you will all become names on plaques. Someone from our village is on these. That's Hua's father. Hua, Stop it. Get up. Dongluo. Bastard. You are here for no good. You don't remember me? But I remember you. Twenty years ago, You tortured me at the Ministry of Punishment. You remember what you did? Of course you don't remember me. My name is Qiu Dongluo. Yuanyin? He saved my life. I don't know what he did before. This man was an executioner in the previous dynasty, Specialising in murdering revolutionaries. Fire-wind was his subordinate. Look at these. They left me with these scars. They tortured me at the Ministry of Punishment. He is spreading false information. Don't fall for it. - Kill him. - The Ministry of Punishment... something from the previous dynasty. When I was young. I killed so many. Now I want to repay my sins by saving lives... You press on the wound. Let me dress it. Throw him out of the village. No way. We can't send him back to Fire-wind. What do you have in mind then? Let's just get it over with, kill him. The way he tortured Dongluo let's do the same to him. Just hang him out in the sun for three days. He'll confess. We need to find out the truth before we execute him. Tie him up. Han. Lock him up in the stable. Keep an eye on him. Han. You go back and guard the man. Interrogate him after dark. He came with bad intentions. Probably about the Imperial Edict. What edict? To kill all martial arts practitioners? This government is even more brutal than the bandits. Don't listen to rumours. Righteousness exists in Heaven and on Earth. Merging into all life forms. Teacher is gone. You have to take a stand. This matter is in your hands. What can I say? This is out of my control. What can I do? The rope is ready. And someone will be hung. No one is going to speak up for him. Ask Han for help. He will listen to you. We grew up together. You don't like killing, do you? I was told to keep guard. You ask me to let him go? Do you realise how much trouble I will get into? Evil deeds deserve retribution. And good deeds deserve gratitude. Exactly. Exactly. I'm trying to show gratitude where it's due. Is this gratitude to you? Then forget I spoke. You save him and I get blamed? You think it's fair to me? I'll just tell it this way. That I tricked you by saying that Fang needed you urgently. And I saved him while you were away. Nonsense. Who will believe that I am so easily tricked by you? If I said that Fang is in danger, wouldn't you go? Her father is the Chief. Who would believe that story? Let me say something. Saving a life is more important. Tell others that it is my idea. I'll probably get a beating. No big deal. Fang, I can't... Like you said, my father is the Chief. They won't be too harsh on me. Han, how about this. Let us put him onto the carriage. Then, you take him away. Here's your favourite kind of jerky. Be back before dawn, ok? You'd feel bad knowing that I'm here taking the blame. I'll miss you, Fang. Two days ago. We were about to... At a time like this, that's all you can think about. Are we leaving or not. Or do you two need to finish off your business first? I'll be waiting for you. Dad. Get... help... Have to... get help... Don't worry. We've just left Martial Village. You're safe. No. Take everyone. Fire-wind will come... people will die... There's the harvest. We can't leave now. Without food, we'll die anyway. Three hundred pieces of silver per head. They won't even spare the children. What do you think we should do? We have to go to Mount Heaven... For help. Mount Heaven? Mount Heaven. 503 pounds of fried wheat. 80 pounds of dried fruit. 360 catties of dried beef. 7 carts of yellow corn. 9 carts of white corn. Three donkeys. Fourteen sheep. Kualo. Nine women no, six. Is it nine or six? Hair-wolf. It was nine. But three died on the road. So now it's six. You. What's your name? Her name is Green Pearl. A Korean from the other side of the Yalu River. Finally you are back. You shouldn't have left me. Do you still recognise this sabre? Do you remember? You hear that? A demon's snarling in your stomach. We all have a few demons inside of us. Let me scare this one away. Listen. They are gone. I want that one. You are not Green Pearl. You are mine. Remember? These clothes are yours. I've kept them. It has your scent. General. General. We found Dagger-peak's body. Did you forget this is my private sanctum? Rip this one's clothes off. Turn him in as a serious criminal and get the bounty. Stone-beast. Dagger-peak was killed beside the creek outside Martial Village. This village used to have 99 households. To protect themselves from bandits. They all practise martial arts. There are a total of 283 people, including children. Three hundred pieces of silver per head. We can ask for 85,000 pieces of silver. They've never liked the idea of us counting the children. Within the Northwestern Boundary. This is the last place where we can make a fortune. Should we raise the price this time? Black-spirit. Send a message to the Duke. When we have a deal, we will start the massacre. It's all your fault. To sneak him out of the village, that was all. Now we have to take him to Mount Heaven? Now there's no more road, no food either. You want Fang to take the blame all by herself? Stop saying that I give you trouble. If you are in trouble, I am in trouble as well. Save the village by believing in him? Look, look at him. He was talking in his sleep. How far are we from Mount Heaven? Did you understand that? It started yesterday since we went uphill. Are you cold? When my parents were alive. Our whole family used to huddle like this to stay warm in the winter. I have not heard you talk like this for a long time I miss home too. How nice if we were home right now. How nice can that be? You wouldn't mistake me for Fang, would you? Whatever happened between you and me is history now. Fire stones from the sky. Follow the fire stones. Follow them. Master. Han. The real reason I'm here, is to seek help. There is an Imperial Edict. Anyone who practises martial arts will be executed. They are the army. There are many of them. They kill everyone. The children and the aged. Not one spared. This is not a battle. This is a disaster. A moment in time to some. May seem forever to others. A swordsman often dies under his own blade. Cause and effect, that is one's karma. You rescued them. And from whence the mortal world they came, back into it they go. Only the Almighty knows their destiny. Yun-Chong. I know how you feel. You don't have to go. Yun-Chong. Yes, Master. I know. Since you know what may be ahead. If you leave Mount Heaven. Do you think you can still keep your promise? I wanted to put my past behind me. But if you ask me to go back into the world I really do not know, Master. Yuanyin. Don't run so fast. You will feel dizzy. Please help us. Help the innocent villagers. There are hundreds of lives in the village. - Adults and children. - Yuanyin. - I beg you. - Don't beg him. It's no big deal. You don't understand. I'd rather fight till I die than to beg on my knees. Dying on my feet is better than dying on my knees. Are you coming? Han. Wait for me. We're leaving. Mulang. Take your Celestial Beam. Xin. Take your Star-chasers. Are we going to help them? Why are you in such a hurry? I still do not feel at ease. Yun-Chong. It is time for Chu to end his solitary meditation. Get him. Yes, Master. Look. Don't look. Are those fire stones? It is not our business. Pull out the sword. This is the first sword I cast after I came to the Mountain. It is powerful enough to cut through rocks. And it revived me. It is called The Deity. Master, that sword... It flows like water with no beginning and no end. This is yours. Take it. This sword is the Heaven's Fall. Chu. The Master calls for you. Yun-Chong, excuse me. You brought the men and the sword. It's time you take them back. This is the sword you abandoned then. I have recast it. Unlearn your past. And find no more regrets in this lifetime. Hua, did you see Fang help the prisoner escape. And put the lives of Han and Yuanyin in jeopardy? Hua. Hua. Yes or no? Hua. Just tell the truth. Yes... No. Yes or no? Guan. You're disturbing our court procedure. You can't speak whenever you want to. One more word, I'm throwing you out. We all have the right to speak up. Let me have a go. What are you doing. Shut up. Fang helped a prisoner escape. And put the village in danger. According to our rules. We have to make an example of her. My teacher. Martial Village takes its rules and regulations seriously. Fang, the defendant, is found guilty. This is the verdict. Guan. Take her out and hang her. Chief. - They're here. - What? - Fire-wind... - What is it? Fire-wind's troops are outside the valley. Hold your posts. All men grab their weapons. Let's go. Why didn't you sound the alarm? Dongluo. Take your men and check it out. Rest of you come with me. Get ready for battle. Hua, get away. The tower on the right is empty. Go. Quickly. Get inside, hurry. Stay inside. Go and grab the seeds. Leave the door and come over here. These are our hope. Teacher, here are some smaller bags. Good. Use the small bags. One each, hurry. What are you doing? Hua is the oldest. All of you have to obey him. Nice heads. We can escape from here. They are in. We are going to lose. Retreat. Hurry up and hide. Find a place to hide. Get away. Don't touch me. Quick. Forgive me. Ancestors of Martial Village. For I have failed, I cannot protect the village any more. May your spirits be with me. All I can do is die fighting. Dad. Fang. Why are you still here? Who would've thought, a cute chick in this shabby village? I saw her first. She's mine. Fang. It's time, are you ready to die? Stone-beast. Go get him. Hurray. These two must be worth a lot. Hey, give us your names. I want to know whose heads are going to make me rich. I've got to set a good price. I am your ancestor. Get down. Don't go over there. You again? He who doesn't kill. What a good deal. Remember. My name is Fu. Go back and tell Fire-wind, We'll be waiting for him. You are all here. The teacher is right. You are all good people. Remember good deeds in your heart and no empty flattery. We grew up together? You really hated fighting and killing. Fang. Fang. Fang. Are you ok? Fang. Han. What took you so long? We went to find help. We brought back seven swords from Mount Heaven. Look I got one as well. Where is the kid? Where is the kid? Fang. Stay here. Let me go find him. Drink your enemy's blood. And you will not be afraid of them any more. Drink it. Little brother. Growing up is tough. You will see the ugly side of the world. When you grow up. It will all become clearer to you. I know. Everything is ugly. But within all the ugliness. You'll eventually find something beautiful. And it'll be your job to protect it. Are you brave enough for that? Yes. But I don't know anything. You have to learn. Let me teach you. You want to be my master? No. Call me brother. We are good brothers. Right? More. Don't fool around. As branch leader of the Heaven and Earth Society... I represent all our members, in thanking the five of you. We are not five. She's the sixth. Han's the fifth. There are seven of us. I think we caught Fire-wind by surprise. And we shouldn't give him any time to think. He won't have time to breathe. Let alone think. What's the plan? Look at the sky. Cloudless and full of stars. So? Have you ever watched the stars on a night like this? The sun will come up in a few hours. The seven of us should go watch the sunrise. We have not seen a sunrise away from Mount Heaven for a long time. This is really worth it. General. He was running away. We caught him by the river. Fu's back. And he brought help. How many? Three... No, four... No, no. Six. Three or four or six? Which is it? Counting Fu himself, a total of seven. One martial arts expert equals twenty normal heads. That means more than a hundred heads. This is big business. A deal of over two hundred thousand. Seven people? And they defeated you and three hundred of your men. They killed Hair-wolf, Stone-beast and Mud-trot. Seven of them? What weapons were they using? Swords. Seven swords? All of them used swords. Especially the last one. It made a strange sound. It pierced through the pillar and killed Mud-trot. There's another young man, he did not use his sword. I don't know how good he is. Their attack is too fierce. The seven swords are really something? Yes. General. Kualo. Gather one hundred men. Get the horses. Prepare breakfast. I will go with you. And avenge our loss. Yes. Shouldn't we wait till it's dark? It is just a small village. Why should I wait till it's dark? General. Fu is outside the gate. What a good show. Fu. You've regained your manhood. I'm happy for you. Oh, don't get all worked up. Since you like money so much. I have a big business offer. That's very kind of you. How big? Three thousand heads. Three thousand? That's a lot. Where are they? There. Are you one of the Seven Swords? You look nice. Just like a girl. Easy, Fu. You lucked out with one battle. Do you think that would scare me off. You think you can beat me? You? Be afraid. Before it's too late. Oh yeah? I'm waiting. Show me what you've got. Before noon today. If you don't surrender. You'll have to deal with the consequences. Fu, You used to be very serious. Today you are telling jokes. I can give you a reply now. After noon today. These seven swords of yours. Will disappear from the face of the earth. And the village will be wiped out. Really? I won't give you the chance. Didn't you say you wouldn't use a sword, wouldn't kill any more? Fire-wind, listen carefully. If your army does not retreat from the outpost before noon. I'll kill you. Fine. Let's forget we were ever friends. Let's wait and see how powerful the Seven Swords really are. We were never really friends. As for the Seven Swords, no need to wait. It has already begun. Guard. The town is on fire. This is serious. Stay and fight with me? Yuanyin. Don't move. The barn is on fire. Fire-wind is a strong adversary. Hold back. Don't ever under-estimate him. Archer, up there. So this is the wine which makes the soldiers lose their mind. Get out of here. All of you. Are you Fire-wind's woman? Take away your stinky paw. You're Korean? You, too? Are you Fire-wind's prisoner? You're free now. Come with me. You all want to control my destiny. All of you men. If you really want to help me, just let me be. Do you like being a slave? - Who are you? - Where are you taking me? I'll take care of you from now on. Wherever I go, you go. So I'm your slave now. Think what you want. Green Pearl. Green Pearl. Bandit. How dare you take my woman away. Barbarian. How many of them were there? Bald-lion's checking on it now. What's there to check? Get my horse. We're going after them. They fed the horses with a laxative. Now they are sick. None of them can run. Useless. What were you all doing? Han, no, Stop. No, Stop. I'm not ready. Why? It's okay. We'll be married sooner or later. Han, no. Please let me go. I can't love two men at the same time. When did it happen? When I was away? No. Not while you were away. After you got back. Who is he? Who is it? I'll kill him. Don't go. You're no match for him. I've checked the stable. The barn and the well. What about here? Not yet. This Yun-Chong, where does he come from? He's from Kweichow I'm from Lanchow. How about you? Same as him, from Kweichow. Maybe you knew one another? Maybe you knew one another? Maybe you knew one another? It's possible. I'd like to know more about his past too. I'll go and have a chat with him. There's no hurry. We're still on guard duty. I'll do it. He's still busy on a plan for Fire-wind. You're right. They poisoned my horses and ruined my wine. They didn't plan to attack. But to stop me from attacking. Fu, I know you need more time. Let's see who will make the next move. Have some wine. It will cool you down. We may not be able to finish harvesting today. Do we have to leave today? We must go. Although we defeated Fire-wind this time. We still did not find where he hides his loot. We did not get him where it hurts. We cannot have a head-on combat with him yet. Otherwise more people will get killed. Are they coming soon? Very soon. They will come any time. Press the holes on the sword. Then it won't slip any more. It's that simple? I'm no good. This sword is for someone better trained than me. Maybe Chief Liu. Not everyone deserves to use a Mount Heaven sword. Definitely not Liu. Master is a wise man. There must be a reason why he gave you this sword. You have to let yourself go. Let your mind go. The sword will follow. Do you want to go back and live like a dog again? I have a slave mark on my body. My family is from the other side of Yalu River. I lived like a stray dog. Just like you. Don't let a mark on your body become one on your soul. You life cannot be controlled by a mark. Don't forget your name, And your home. Home? Stop. Go to hell. What a waste. Fire-wind, you finally came. Protect the money you've been hiding from your men. They will find it one day. Then... Then only death awaits you. Move aside. The entire village's empty. They all ran away. What are you thinking? Will you teach me how to use a sword? But I have no sword. What are you holding in your hand? A piece of rope. Think about how to make use of the rope. Then come to see me. Remember, a rope can be a sword. Yun-Chong, Come. Someone deliberately left it here. Someone is leaving a trail. We have a traitor among us. This did not come from the rations cart. Why? It was Liu who guarded the rations cart. He can't be the one to have left it. If we cannot find the traitor. No matter how far we go. Our enemies will know. This person won't stop at this. He'll keep trying to contact his master. We'll have to find the traitor. We all know one another. There's only one stranger here. That Korean woman. Maybe she's the one. Don't jump to conclusions. Who do you find suspicious? Why don't we buy some time? Slow down the retreat. Confuse the traitor. Good idea. Buy some time. Let's take them all into the mountain and hide. We'll continue the journey after we catch the traitor. You find her suspicious too? I hope she is the one. I know everybody here except her. How is Joy Luck? He is old and cannot run. What happened? He can't even swallow. Don't abandon him. See how we can take him with us. You must be hungry. - We have the same back home. - Very similar. That's Chu's, isn't it? Chu. Chu? That's him. The man with a hood who's really good with his sword. Chu, Are you dancing? I think he likes you. Do you like him? That's Chu. The man who gave you the handkerchief... The man who gave you this... I don't want your handkerchief. I was just asking you. I just wanted to know if you like him. You like him, too? What? Like. Understand? Like. Understand? Love. Do you love him? Love. Do you love him? What's wrong with you? Fang. What's wrong with you? Fang. Get away. The water's poisoned. Move. The water's poisoned. Did you drink the water. Did you? Are you all right? You're all wet. Get dry first. Damn, she is poisoned. Fang. She's been sitting by the river all this time. I saw her putting something into the water. Fang... what can we do about her? How can you be so sure? What were you doing by the river? Washing your handkerchief. - Do they suspect me? - That I poisoned the water? - Don't worry about them. - Did you drink the water? - No. - Fang. What are they saying? Something they don't want us to know? Don't panic. She does not understand our language. Chu only went to ask what happened. Ask about what? It is her without a doubt. How can you be so rude to someone who saved us. We are the Heaven and Earth Society. We always base our actions on reason. And we are always righteous. Righteous people jump to conclusions, too. Make mistakes, too. Not us. Never? Never. What, you don't trust us? Dongluo, don't go overboard. Calm down. The river could be contaminated naturally. The mountain's full of poisonous plants. We have to get to the bottom of this. Get someone to discard all water. Good thing we caught it early. Hurry up. Check it out. Be careful. If everything looks good, pack up and go. - Let's get going. - Get a move on. He's got something against us. Be careful of him. We can't always expect to be helped. We need to help ourselves. You're right. We can't expect help all the time. But you watch what you say also. Don't just open your trap. Chief... All right, I will listen to you. I'll shut up if you ask me to. You believe in me. Over there, All the way east, is Yalu River. Where we are heading. Our home. Home. Home. I will be home. I will be home. I will be home. Black-spirit. General. Send a message to the Duke. We need to shoot down Seven Swords with a cannon. Yes. Go. He is likely to figure out what we are doing. He does not attack now. But he will bring in more troops and attack again. And we have a traitor among us. No matter how powerful the Seven Swords are. We won't be able to protect the entire village. Let's change our route. We have too many people. It is difficult to change our route. We have no alternative but to take a risk. Let the horses go as a diversion for Fire-wind. We'll hide in the cave. Sir. Do we have to let all the horses go? I know you can't bear to let them go. But there are hundreds of lives here. We can only keep a few fast horses. Let the rest go. Han. Let's find a right spot to set them free. Han. It's time. Joy Luck is old and stubborn. Let me send him away. Run. Run. Joy Luck is after us. Joy Luck. Take care. Joy Luck. Congratulations Your Honour. A precious ancient sword was discovered in the Lo-Ian tomb. An invaluable thousand-year old sword. It conquers all. My Lord, would you like to try it out? Fire-wind is here. I need double the usual quantity of wine. And I need your cannons. I have something else that you want. It is information. My Lord. Is the information useful to me? If not, I won't even be able to afford the cannons. I have information too. You want to bet on it? What is the price? Double your price. Is it expensive? A few months ago. We sent some spies to Stone River Village. Wait. My Lord. How much does this information cost me so far? One third. My Lord. Your spy is about to be discovered. This is the sign he left. This is my information, and it costs one third as well. Go on. Another one third? Seven Swords know that he left something. They have changed their route. If you send in your troops by following this, In the heavy fog, Your entire troops will fall off the cliff. Have they left? Yes. Sir. Call them back now. Yes. Sir. I have enough money to cover my wine and cannons. Aren't you interested in my spy? This matter is already in Seven Swords' hands. Please give an order. Let me take the wine and cannon away. Attention all troops. Ready to move. We are leaving. Why do we have to hide in this cave? I know you must have a master plan. I don't have any master plan. We have a traitor among us. That's why we need to find a place to hide. So that we have time to uncover him. But they are all very restless and worried. Doesn't matter, Just tell them there is a secret escape route. And we'll make our getaway at the right time. And remember. You must also guard the cave entrance. Guard all the exits. Do not let any one in or out. On pain of death. Sir. Why do we need that? It is a must. The traitor amongst us. Will try to notify our foes. That's what we want him to do. When the traitor is found. We will be on our way again. This could be a passage which leads us outside. You from the Heaven and Earth Society. Are you not all righteous? Guan, what are you up to? What are you doing? Ask your people, why are they looking in my things? Speak up. Chief, I... He seems to be so against us. So, what were you doing? Chief I did it, so I'll take the responsibility. You think you can shoulder it. You're dragging all of us down with you. Why are you fighting? Stop at once. Dongluo. What are you doing? I failed you Chief. You do what you will. No. It is my fault. I went to steal from Yun-Chong. What? You steal from Yun-Chong? I... Say it. I just wanted to know. Why is he so angry with us? And against us. Master Yun-Chong. If any of us have wronged you. Please forgive us. Chief Liu I came with only one intention, to help you all. If I caused any problem, forgive me. The three of us were getting to know one another better. As the saying goes, It takes one to know one. Chief Liu. Rest assured. If I have any ill feelings towards your society. I promise I will settle it with you directly. And not keep it inside. Get ready. Fire. Fire. The artillery is ready. Are we going to attack? Cannon in place. Get ready. Fire. Bookie. You've heard me singing this song for so long. Do you know what the lyrics mean? It sounds like... A nursery rhyme from the Yalu River area. Tell me. Sweet little baby, grow up fast. Golden sky. Golden flowers. The Golden land is at your feet. Sweet little baby let's grow up fast. Your black eyes will see. That the future is yours to be. Look at them. Yesterday they were lovely children. Today they've become beasts. We all turn into man-eating beasts. In this world. The most valuable thing is your life. If you can stay alive. You can make a real fortune. It's me. Can I stay with you from now on? Can I? I know what happened between you and Liu. You will not understand. That we carry forth things from the previous generation. What things? The murder of my father. Who murdered your father? Your Chief. Chief Liu. In the Heaven and Earth Society. My father was the Deputy Chief. Years ago, they were raided at Dan Fortress and barely escaped. They suspected that there was a traitor among them. And they thought it was my father. Who betrayed them. Liu wanted to be just and hung him without adequate evidence. In public. With this background I no longer wanted to be part of society. But society will not let me be. We've only just met. Do you really understand me? If we are together, do you think I would worry? Family matters, society matters. I don't want you to get involved. With you by my side. I would only have more to worry about. And find it more difficult to let go. Do you understand now? What happened to you? I was not afraid to die. But I am not sure now. Death. I am afraid to die. I don't know why. You are afraid because they suspect you. No. I had nothing in the past. Then I could not lose anything. But now I feel different. I feel I have everything. I don't want to lose anything. You've been to Hell and back. That's why you know not how to react. Now, I have you. I am so scared that one day you will not believe in me any more. Don't be afraid. I think I know. A secret of Fire-wind's. Every time he gets any loot. Fire-wind always had the soldiers leave the gold bars. And puts them into the statue's head through the roof. Where to? Pearly Gate Outpost. Just the two of us? Fire-wind's troops are in the mountain. Pearly Gate Outpost will be empty. Get their loot and they will disband. With the Dragon Sword, we don't need the key. Green Pearl. Come and save Green Pearl. What? Green Pearl. She has been wounded by a sword. What happened? She is badly injured. I... Where is she wounded? What are you saying? She is bleeding too much. Stop her bleeding. Where is Chu? I don't see him. Xin went to look for him. Not found him yet. Tell us, where is Chu? Chu. Chu has been caught by Fire-wind. I should not have told Chu the secret. Go and save him. Go and save him. What are you saying? Go and save him. I made a mistake... please forgive me. You must save him. What are you saying? Where is Chu? Go to... What did she say before she died? This is the map of Pearly Gate Outpost. He is there. There is no alternative. We have to split up. The six of us will go to save Chu. This may be a journey. Of no return. I won't let you down. Your body is not fully recovered. Keep the medicine in case of emergency. Let's go. Han, All of you have to come back. Listen up I cannot foresee what will happen to us. No matter how dangerous, We Seven Swords will live and die together. Fire. Fire. It's the entrance. The entrance is on fire. Fu is right. The traitor, finally. Fang. Where is the prescription Fu gave you? The prescription is the real map of the secret escape route. It's a map. Take the children with you and go. Dad, what about you? Why don't you come with us? I must stay until I find out the truth. The truth? Fu said, once our hiding place is exposed. The traitor will escape from the fake secret route. If I don't find out who it is I will never be at peace. Till my dying day. All of you go over. Take Hua's hand. Turn around. Let me take a look at you. Dongluo? The whole mountain is now under siege. The Duke will attack when he sees the fire. You will die if you don't surrender. Dad. Go tell everybody. Dongluo is the traitor. What? He is the traitor. Dongluo. He is the traitor. Why are you laughing? Dongluo... Don't kill any more. Don't kill any more. The price of truth costs lives. Stay right there. Easy, Fire-wind. We're here to talk business. All right. Give Green Pearl back to me. We can talk. Where is she? She is dead. Duan Yuzhu... Finally the sword is in my hand. Green Pearl. What did you call her? My woman was called Duan Yuzhu. She used to be my spy. She was Korean too. Just like Green Pearl I witnessed her being killed. Green Pearl is not your spy. She is definitely not your spy. Well said. Then I will let you go. Go. You wouldn't lie to me. I trust you. Why... Why do you speak to me in Chinese? You are testing me. Do you suspect me? No, I do not. Let the horses go. Wait. Stop. Stop. What about our deal if you kill him? Put it this way. You want Chu back? Just leave me all of your swords. I want to use The Dragon to see if I can break the other six swords. Where did you grow up? With wolves. What? With wolves? Where are your parents? I have no idea. Everything changed since we left Mount Heaven. Don't you think so? What is different? I feel I should not be herding horses any more. I should be a swordsman. What did your dad say before he died? Not to avenge his death. You escaped from the world to forget the revenge? You did not revenge. But hatred is still with you. Suppressing it may lead to a worst end. This is also your karma. The Transience never breaks. Worldly matters always end. Go. Why are you always so happy? What is there to smile about? And... why not? I heard that Liu was a member of the Heaven and Earth Society? Yes. After he came to our village. He taught us martial arts. We used to be raided by bandits. We had better days after they came. Listen. This is the sound of death. The sharper the sword, the closer to death. Are you afraid to die? Mulang. The Dragon still has to be worked on. Yet, take it, go and help them. And this, The Transience. Is an arrogant sword. I did my best. It is still only half-finished. I was about to finish it. But now, there is no time. I'll have to let it go with you. Yun-Chong. Please step back. I have to take back what is mine. You are the same kind of person as me. Nonsense. You have nowhere to go. One day. You will die like me. Squatting. Watch out. Careful. Teacher. Fang. I am Han. Give me the sword. Fang. Fang. Put the sword down. My dear, how did you survive this? Put it down. Put the sword down. It's me. Fang. Han. Fire-wind is dead. But the Imperial Edict is still in effect. The King will send even more killers. The fight has not ended yet. Where is he pointing? To where the Edict came from. The way to the capital. It's worth us giving it a try. Try what? Try to find the Emperor. And convince him to abolish the Edict. Han, I've decided to go with them. I won't go. I want to stay and protect them. The decision is yours to make. Fang, Hua, take care. No. Han, your sword cannot leave them. Follow them. After you learn how to use this sword. Then, come back. I can't leave you here. I don't want to see you stay and become like one of the villagers. No, I can't. Actually. Without you. We will still be strong. Don't under-estimate us. And don't under-estimate yourself. Promise me. Otherwise, I will regret it for the rest of my life. Go. Han. I'm off. Righteousness exists in Heaven and on Earth. Merging into all life forms. On Earth, it's in the rivers and mountains. In Heaven, it resides in the sun and the stars.
