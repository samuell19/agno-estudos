YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP A PLAN, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GET IT APPROVED. AND BY "IT," I MEAN EVERYTHING FROM THE SUBSTANCES WE USE TO THE PROCESSES... TO THE TILLING... THE GRAZING... ALL OF IT. AND AN INSPECTOR COMES OUT ONCE A YEAR FOR THREE YEARS. PRETTY THOROUGH. YOU HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY CHEMICAL-FREE. I HAVE TO KEEP PERFECT RECORDS, SALES RECEIPT OF ALL THE FOOD THE COWS EAT. SOUNDS LIKE A COMMITMENT. IT'S BECOME MY LIFE, BUT HOPEFULLY TOMORROW IT'S OVER. IT'S OUR LAST INSPECTION. OH, THAT'S INCREDIBLE. I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK. I HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT FOR YOU. THE WORLD COULD USE MORE ORGANIC FARMERS. THANK YOU. [CAR HONKS] OH, SPEAKING OF THE WIDE WORLD- MARCUS: KENDALL! HERE COMES A SLICE OF IT RIGHT NOW. MEMPHIS: HEY GIRL!

[SCOFFS] I'D SAY! MARCUS AND I STUDIED ORGANIC FARMING TOGETHER IN NEW YORK. AND NOW HE'S MY ACCOUNTANT, BOOKKEEPER, MARKETING AGENT... ACTUALLY, THE LIST OF WHAT YOU AREN'T IS SHORTER. WHAT IS HE IS MORE IMPORTANT. CLINT IS A VETERINARIAN. HE JUST HELPED ME WITH BERNADETTE'S BABY. BETTER YOU THAN ME. CLINT: WE HAD OUR HANDS FULL. IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU GUYS, BUT I'D BETTER GET GOING. I'LL LET YOU GUYS GET TO IT. [SAYS SUSPICIOUSLY] UMM-HMM. KENDALL: WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THOSE TWO? WELL, I'D BEEN WARNED. THANK YOU.

WELL, I TOLD HIM THE INSPECTOR WAS COMING TOMORROW. [GASPS] WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST CAME UP. WORDS HAPPEN. DID HE ASK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE? HE ASKED HOW MANY CATTLE I HAVE. HE'S A SPY. GREAT. KENDALL: IF HE IS A SPY, HE'S A TERRIBLE ONE. HE GAVE ME A CARD WITH HIS NAME ON IT. OH NO, YOU TRUST ME. IF HE'S A McCREE, HE'S UP TO NO GOOD! THEY'RE ALL BANDITS TO THE BONE AND YOU KNOW THAT! ¶ ¶ BRICK McCREE, HMPH! ¶ [TENSE MUSIC] ¶ BRICK: YOU'RE FIRED, PETE. PETE: BUT MR. McCREE, IT'S CHRISTMAS. BRICK: HUMBUG.

WHAT DO YOU THINK? THE LIPSTICK TOO. YOU WANT A SAMPLE? [GIGGLES] DID YOU SEE THAT? HE BLUSHED! HOW IS THIS HELPING US? IT MEANS HE'S HUMAN. OH, I GOT THIS. DON'T WORRY. INSPECTOR STITTUM: MISS RILEY, I'M SORRY BUT UH... WE HAVE A PROBLEM. KENDALL: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. I FOLLOWED THE RULES FOR 3 YEARS. I DOUBLE... I TRIPLE-CHECKED EVERYTHING. INSPECTOR STITTUM: EXCEPT FOR ONE MAJOR THING... YOU SIGNED IN THE WRONG PLACE. SO YOU MEAN THAT- INSPECTOR STITTUM: YEP... YOU'RE CERTIFIED! OH! [HAPPY LAUGHTER] SPENCER, GET IN HERE! NOW WERE YOU REALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING MY PICTURES FROM MY TRIP TO EL PASO, OR WERE YOU JUST... FLIRTING WITH ME TO GET THE CERTIFICATE? ARGH... FIGURES... FALL FOR IT EVERY TIME.

KENDALL: HE'S A McCREE BUT HE SAID MY DAD WAS GOOD TO HIM; THAT THEY MET AT THE RODEO- MEMPHIS: HE CAME TO SPY ON HER. [GASPS] MM-HMM. SO IS THAT WHY CLINT'S HERE TO HELP HIS DAD? Y'ALL KNOW HE HAS CANCER, RIGHT? NOW HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? SHEILA MICHAELS WORKS AT THE HOSPITAL. LEAN BACK. SO KENDALL, HOW LONG HAVE YOUR FATHERS HATED EACH OTHER? MEMPHIS: SINCE BEFORE CLINT AND HER WERE BORN. NOT THAT I EVEN KNOW WHY. VIVIAN: SO DO YOU LIKE HER? [GASPS] I THINK IT'S GREAT. DOES SHE KNOW? NO.

THIS IS THE 20TH CENTURY. 21ST. YOU CAN'T JUST STEAL LAND LIKE THAT ANYMORE. ALL THAT PROPERTY USED TO BELONG TO BRICK. THE LAST CHANCE RANCH WAS BRICK'S LAND. THAT'S WHAT I KNOW. WELL THEN HOW DID KENDALL'S DADDY GET IT? I DON'T KNOW AND NEITHER DOES ANYBODY ELSE I RECKON. EXCEPT BRICK. YOU KNOW, I BET IT WAS HUSH MONEY. YOUR DADDY FOUND OUT THAT BRICK WAS LAUNDERING CASH OR SOMETHING. DO YOU THINK SO? YES! YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW IT IS! GUS: OH NOW STOP THAT; BRICK MIGHT BE BAD, BUT HE AIN'T EVIL. [SCOFFS] SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. GUS: NOW IF YOU FOLKS ARE GONNA PRIDE YOURSELF IN BEING THE BEST TOWN GOSSIPS, AT LEAST GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT. GRANDDADDY, BAD AND EVIL MAY NOT BE THE SAME FRUIT... BUT THEY'RE IN THE SAME BOWL. GUS: YEAH, AND THAT BOWL AIN'T JAIL. BAD IS SELFISH. EVIL IS MALICIOUS. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BABY GIRL. [VIVIAN WHISPERING] WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER?

I DON'T KNOW WHY YOUR FAMILY IS SO INTENT ON RUINING MY LIFE. I WAS GONNA SAY WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER? I MEAN, YOU RUN AN ORGANIC FARM AND YOU PUT THAT IN YOUR BODY? TALK ABOUT RUINING YOUR LIFE- I LIKE THE TASTE OF FAKE CHICKEN NUGGETS, AND I DON'T WANT CAVITIES. ¶ ¶ I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'D BELIEVE ME. THE TRUTH IS, NOBODY CONTROLS MY DAD. THE BEST THING I COULD DO WAS GET AWAY FROM HIM SO HE COULDN'T CONTROL ME. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DOES WHAT HE DOES. I DON'T EVEN THINK HE KNOWS WHY HE DOES WHAT HE DOES, HE JUST DOES. AND YOU'RE RIGHT... I DIDN'T COME HERE JUST TO CHECK ON THE CALF, I CAME TO CHECK ON YOU. AND TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR HIM.
