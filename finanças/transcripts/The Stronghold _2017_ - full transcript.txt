Oh! That s Vovchyk. I won t go. The next solar eclipse won t come anytime soon. There are mountains there. Heights. Once your dad dragged me to the same mountains. Very high. I felt dizzy. Maybe that wasn t because of heights. Maybe. But I used to be very easily frightened. So your father hugged me and said: Don t be afraid! I am here. You know, I feel he s still here. Always. I know. Where are you? The bus is already there. - I m almost out. - Sandwiches! It s waiting only for you. I m coming, coming. - Okay, Vitya, we ve just left. - Your plane! Vovchyk, I am outside. O, Ancient Spirits! The Stone of Power is near. I know. Help me to find it. And to put the whole world on its knees. It s flying! Look! So cool... Nice stuff. Where did you buy it? Dude, what do you mean, buy it? Vitya made it himself. Dude, what do you mean, buy it? Vitya made it himself. Seriously? Seriously? Vitya, tell him. I made it myself. Good. Geniuses. Hah! Now up to the mountain, without stops. Or somebody wants to miss a cool solar eclipse happening once every one hundred years No! No... No! No... So move it! So move it! Vitya, look at this thing. And I took my sunglasses. Let me... Here. Nah... When the sun hides, that will be it! So why am I dragging all these crackers with me? Quiet! When apocalypse comes we ll put up some fireworks, that s gonna be a cool party! Zombie party! Zombie Vovchyk! This is real apocalypse. Hey, everyone! Attention! There is a hanging bridge in front of us. There s nothing complicated, but remember some rules: Follow me one by one, and don t look down! Any questions? No! Let s go! Now you re gonna fall down and get killed. Go then! I ll follow you. Careful! Oh, oh, oh! Don t do that! Follow me! It s not scary, ho, ho, ho! I looked: the height Oh, ohis ridiculous. that!

Are you gonna watch the eclipse over there? Vitya! Where are you going?! Forget those idiots! Vitko! Roger! Base calling, roger. We are cool guys, and who doubts it will get a punch in the face! Really! Let s beat those idiots up! I ll be holding them, and you... The sun... What is this? Looks like an earthquake. Help us please! Heeeeeelp! Your hand! Give me your hand! THE STRONGHOLD Vovchyk! Here. Heeeere! Rosanka... Here! Rosanka... Everyone follow me! Guys, come here. Don t be shy. Some to this one... To this one... And to this one... Now go quickly to your mom! Take him! Veles! Go, go! Halt! It s always like this with these cumans. They see water, they jump in to bathe. And you are tough! You didn t get scared. Go! Hop! Who is he? Well... He saved me near the Gloomy Rock. What... have you left the stronghold? Uncle Ilko... I forbid you to leave the stronghold on your own. Heard me? Well, I... Done something again, you curly misfit? Tell me. Ah! Well, I rode out and went up to the Gloomy Rock, just by chance... Then I looked around and saw such great flowers! Uh-huh. Flowers... Flowers! And the cumans were trampling them. And I got so angry, listen, so angry... I take one cuman like this, the second, the third one and threw almost all of them away. But here suddenly... It s... Andak himself! Andak! Well, this cuman khan. And he s like this, and I m almost, you know... And this one rolls down from the mountain, hooch! Vovchyk?! Huh? Not Vovchyk. You, move away from him! Oh. Who are you? Where am I? Is this some kind of a joke? He s got a funny way of speaking. Could he be a cuman spy? Spy! Beat him! That s enough talking. Veles will show everything tomorrow. Aha. Get him to the marshes. Hey, hey... heyyy... Where are you dragging me to? Hey! Great khan? Your spirits have let me down. What happened? Wasn t that Rymov guy in the place I pointed out? He was. But a guy in strange clothing prevented me from killing him. A strange guy? Did he have a sign like this on him? Yes. A dragon. He had the same one on his back. Great khan, he has finally come! This is the messenger from the spirits to give us infinite power. Hey! Why have you come? I brought you some milk. Who are you? Olenka. I saw Oleshko bring you, and grandfather told me to check on you in the marshes. So... are you gonna have milk or not? Where am I? Probably in the barn. What place is this? Rymiv. Rymiv? This is the name of our stronghold defending Rus from the cumans. Rus?! Which year is this? You are weird. 1120 AD. 1120... Dang! What kind of spy are you? I am no spy! That s what I am saying, you are a lousy spy. And I am saying I am not a spy. And I am saying I am not a spy. Look at him: just arrived, and he already has girls running cirlces around him. Look at him: just arrived, and he already has girls running cirlces around him. - Hm! - Hm! You are... I have... come to say thank you. I have to come back home. My friend might die there... You... Don t be sad! If you make Veles's check, everything s gonna be alright! If Veles has let you go alive, you re one of us. Here s your bag! What is your name? Vitya. And I am Illya, this is Dobrynya, and this is our wise man, grandfather Ovsiy, and you already know Oleshko. Tell me your story. First I was flying somewhere in the darkness, and then there was a flash! Everything froze, as if the time stopped. Suddenly something crashed and I flew out of that rock. The guy got hit big time. This is called a megaphone. I brought it from my world: from the future. Wh This is plastic. Chinese are making those. So you re saying you re from the future? I live a thousand years ahead. And I really have to come back. To find a way how to do it. What will you say, grandfather? What is there to say? We have to think. For now you ll live at Milanka s place, my sister s, and then we ll see. I ll take him there! Don t sneak around in my garden. What are you talking about, grandfather? I know what, misfit. Tread lightly. Well, let s go. Ah... Good day to you! Uncle Ilko sent him to you. To live here for a while. Come in, sonny. You ll call me aunt Milanka, and this is my daughter Rosanka. And what is your name? Vitya. Come on, let s eat Rosanka s dumplings! She s made some good ones. Let s go, let s go! Oleshko! Call Illya and Dobrynya and come for supper. We will! Well? Khm... this is for you... Rosanka! Stopping halfway again? Orlyk, looks like you re always hungry! Well Hush! Quiet, Vitko is sleeping there! And I am eating instead of him! May I? Grandfather Ovsiy, come in! Here, I ve gathered some. Oh, look at them apples! I can take care of the trees alright... Chinese make those... Put it back! Are you out of your mind, grandfather? And who broke my apple He s been walking around my garden for three nights in a row, the filthy thief... Rosanka, tell him I didn't come for apples, okay? Shut up, Oleshko. You re thick, that s all I can say. In our sleep and waking hours we have to keep our land safe... And in the darkest times we won t fall down under black rain... - We'll stand side... - Great. - ...by side... - This is our favorite. - ...with our swords and shields. - We sing it when we feel good. Or when it's really hard. I've been to see Veles today. I've found out something. When there's a sign on the sky, and night comes to visit day, the hole will open up and take you to the same moment you came from. When will this eclipse happen then? Who knows: maybe tomorrow, maybe in a hundred years. Veles also said you can open the hole by force, but only the magi know how to do it. It s hard to find these magi, and if you do, they ll check you in and out. It s not hard to find them! I know a place... With tons of magi... So... let s go there?! Now you can t leave Rymiv, because the steppe is full of cumans... Cool... Boo! Oleshko! You told me you knew where to look for a magus. Well... I did. I want to... I need to get there. You can get there, it s just... there s no point in doing it... Why? All people know the magus won t say anything if you don t pass his tests. Which tests? What do you mean? Test of sword, arrow, mind... I would try. We can try. Gift! Don t be so scared! This is Tugaryn. He s a cuman. He s a bit... He-he. I caught him! Why are you standing there? Jump onto the horse! Go! Gift. You re a great rider! How?... Oh! And now we have to aim here. Stronger... Hop! Oh! Well! As you can see, you haven t passed the test. Oleshko, can you teach me? I don t know... That meganome of yours, or what you may call it, do you really need it? If you help me with lessons, the megaphone is yours. So we ll start tomorrow! Okay. Okay means good. Everything is okay, dude! Dude?! Dude. Dude! Dude. One, two! One, two, three! Cool photography! Cool! Oooh yeah! Oooh yeah! It s burning! Can you see it? Wham! Wham! Wham! Hold tighter! Have you seen how big this sword is? Wow! Here. Oh! You re... Sorry! Right onto my leg... So how do I wave this thing? Murovets likes it. Murovets Our uncle Ilko. He was born in Moroviysk... Wait, wait... isn t Dobrynya Mykytovych by any chance? Mykytovych, that s right. Are you kidding me? Where s Alyosha Popovych then? Alyosha, Kalyosha! You can call yourself that. So it s you? I am Popovych, no Alyosha. Oleshko, you won t believe it: everybody knows about you in our world! They tell fairy tales about you to children. So am I known in your world? You are! You are a knight from a fairy tale! I am a fairytale knight! Cool! I should tell Rosanka that. So that she knows who she s dealing with. Looks like the guy has gotten the hang of it... This was awesome! Dude! You hit it well! I told you I d teach you, so I did. So where s my meganome? Orlyk. Orlyk. Turn it on. See? It s written there. So are you gonna show me the way? Hm... So this is Rymiv. Here s a field. There s a forest behind the field. Here... That s all. Why do you...? I need a pen. I use it to write in a notebook. Notebook? Forget it. But not a word about this to Illya! Rosan... Rosanka... Turn it on... ROSAN...! Who s there? Come on! - Mom... Probably grandfather Ovsiy came up with something again. Go to bed... Hey! Rosanka! Are you crazy? Why are you shouting all over Rymiv? Can you imagine? I am a fairytale knight! Huh? Uh-huh... Fairytale. When are you gonna use your head? I do. I... I am... Look! Wait. How does it work like that? Shall we go to the lake? I ll tell you. - To the lake... - Ah! Ah! - Coming! I m coming! - Come back to the house! Let s go. I ll tell you. I won t wander around the lakes with you, don t even bother to ask me! You are our eyes. We ll see when the time comes to act. What... what s up with you? I could shoot you! What s up? Nothing. I am gathering mushrooms, what about you? I am going to the magus. I have to go home. Understand? By the way. Do you... do you know where this is? Well... looks like we ve arrived. Who! This is... This is me. Are you the magus, mister? Why have you come? How do I get back home? To my time? Without waiting for the eclipse? Knowledge for free?!!! ... Then test me! I am ready! Reveal your fears! The most secret ones! If you tell me the wrong thing, you ll stay in my world forever! Your time has started... Once we went to the mountains with my parents... There was a very high bridge there... There was an accident and... our car fell down. And we were falling... and I was screaming... screaming... screaming... I am still scared. I am very afraid of heights. And that is why I didn t save my friend. There is a Perun stone in the world. It is able to lead you between centuries. But not every mortal human is able to find it. And where do I look for it? Where the wingless make their nests. You ll see it when you straddle the wind. Only someone able to touch another heart with his own can do it. But remember: that ancient force spreads misery and evil around. Where is he What do you mean? We are alone here. How much time have I been absent? What? You are standing next to me. Let s go. Let s go away from here. He said I have to find some Perun stone. And I am to look for it where the wingless make their nests. And I ll see it when I straddle the wind. What does this hodge Where the wingless make their nests... We have a village! It s called the Stork Village! Cool. And it seems it s warmer here. So this is Stork Village. People here are kind and a bit weird. They cannot get angry or jealous, they don t go to war. They are like children. They say they are descended from storks. That was a very long time ago... But... how do we find the stone here? We need to... What? Straddle the wind. Great. - Great. - Follow it! Is it cold? It s not a Stork Village, it s some kind of a Walrus Village. I ll try to go deeper. Got it! The little devil found something we need! Cumans! CUMANS! Run for your life! Stork Village is burning! Dobrynya and I will enter from the other side. And you, Oleshko, will stay here as a boss. Oh yeah! Follow me! Ho-ho! Just look how nicely we got in. Hot... I ll take this piece of iron off. What is there s an arrow? If I get an arrow in the head, so be it. These are ours. Boo! Oh yeah! Look! One, three, seven, twenty... Seventeen... There s gonna be a little scar. Eighteen. Dang! You were told not to! Why have you come? Grandpa, we have, you know... I ll show you grandpa ! I ll show you! Okay, grandfather, let the children eat. Eat and come back to the house. And you are not to leave it for three days! Grandfather, we have to return the guy to his place. You ll go to the Gloomy Rock tomorrow at dawn. I hope Perun stone helps you. Lord, we haven t made it in time. The Rymiv people arrived, and the guy... Lord, we haven t made it in time. The Rymiv people arrived, and the guy... Shut your face! Shut your face! Have you lured me into a trap set by Rymiv people?! I don t know everything, lord, but Raven saw a guy with a stone there... I lost a whole unit of my warriors because of you! I am sick and tired of your mistakes. Without me, the power won t come into khan s hands. I ll bring the stone to you. Or maybe I... Shucks. Doesn t work. There s some trick here. Magus was also saying about some hearts. To release the power. But how? There is no power in it. There is an idea. There is an idea. Perun is a master of thunder and lightnings. Perun is a master of thunder and lightnings. We have to wait for a thunderstorm. Maybe it fills the Perun stone with power. What about me..? Let me hold it. Okay, I ve changed my mind. The stone hasn t worked. Okay... Don t go there! There s no point in wandering around until you re done sorting! You ll know better next time to disobey grandfather. Ah! It s you. I wanted to say that you shouldn t have punished Olenka. I cajoled her into showing me the way. Hah, you cajoled her into showing the way, and I, into sorting beans! Maybe that ll do her good! Can I look? There s nothing for you to look at! But these wings here are not right. You cannot fly using those. Why so? Here! Look. How did you manage it? Very simple: aerodynamics! Is this some kind of magic? No, this is science. I want to make wings so that our guys drop like vultures on cumans heads. We can do that, but you ll have to fly off the mountain. Off the mountain? The tower looks different from here. Was it really named in honor of a knight? There is a legend about it. Do you believe in legends? I used not to, but now... It was a long time ago. There once lived in our land a knight named Tverdynya. And there was a girl who he loved, Zoryana. They decided to get married. But on the very same day Zoryana went to a dark forest and never came back. Tverdynya looked for her in the thicket for a long time but didn t find her. Pain and desperation filled his heart. So he ripped it out from his chest and threw it into the wilds so that it was closer to his loved one. And in the same moment he turned into a stone fortress. And his heart also turned into a stone. Who finds that stone heart will meet his true love. Or find a lost one. How? Well... Nobody knows. But I believe that it exists. This is for you. Vitya, you are... you are special. Stone of power, make your way towards me. I am calling you! Come! If somebody told me I d be making this stuff... This stuff meaning? This stuff! The device for flying. Delta-delta-nape! Delta plane. Ah. Since childhood, I ve wanted to see a human fly. First I tried it myself: I made wings from planks and feathers and jumped from the trees. Oh! See? Oh. Oh. Wow. So was this after the fall? Not after the fall, after the flight! A short flight. Hello. Uncle Ilko has been calling you. He told you to come immediately. Why so quickly? I don t know... What happened? We took a hostage. And we ve found out something. It turns out, they didn t attack Stork Village by accident. They were looking for... a guy with a stone there. How do they know about me? This I don t know. But if Andak himself is hunting the stone, he doesn t need it for good deeds, that s for sure. We have to hide the stone somewhere. Let me hide the stone! Or... I can go hide... Do so. Let s go. Guys! Come eat some nuts. No time. Ah. Whatever... It s not there. - The stone has disappeared! Are you out of your mind, woman? This is a magic artefact. Heard it? A magic antiduck. And you crack nuts with it... Ah... Well... We have to hide it better. It should be a place so that Milanka, cumans or other wrongdoers never get to it. There is a place like that. Over there! Come with me. I won t go there. That place is the safest. So hide it yourself. Fear favors the lonely. It overcomes them easily. And when you re afraid of something, just imagine there are friends next you, friends you love, and the fear will disappear! You are not alone here, sonny. The whole Rymiv is with you. All of your land. Onwards! We are there! Hello, grandfather! What is it, stuck down there? Hush! Or you ll get stuck! My hand is still strong! Will you be able to come out? Well Scared, but not that much! I hope the stone gets filled with power. It needs a thunderstorm. The time has come. The thunderstorm comes, finally! Vitya, remember grandfather didn t let me leave the house and told me to sort beans from peas? Uh-huh... Maybe they are better off together? And I am dividing them apart. Yes, Olenka, that s some real tragedy: the parting of beans and peas. You re a cold, rude and disgusting creature! I used to be special not that long ago... Hail... Wait a second... You re very brave. Halt! Halt, or I ll shoot! Tugarkan! A gift. Alive? Brother! I see you haven t changed. Get your hands off me. Brother! These are gifts for you. Enough! Go away. Servant! Take him away, I don t want to see him. And change his clothes! The gods have turned their backs on me. No, great khan. Gods are with us. With us, my lord! Uh-huh. Now! What happened? Perun stone has disappeared. How?! Looks like Tugaryn has stolen it. So cumans have the stone?! And how do we take it back? What do you mean, how? We steal it by night. Oleshko, I m not into jokes at the moment! Spread some mud over your face and steal it. Oleshko is right, though he s still a misfit. Right? You can t really make it to cumans camp... But if you use a delta plane...! What about the face? We ll fix your face! We have to finish the delta plane as soon as possible. Okay! What do I do? Don t get in the way. I can do that. That s some delta plane! Cool... We only have to paint it black, so that it s not visible by night. Tomorrow Olenka and I will bring some mud from the marshes, and you and Oleshko should take the flyer to Tverdynya. We ll paint it there. And that s all for today. So where s the promised power? Oh great khan, power has to be breathed into the stone. And only the one who found it is able to do it. Oleshko, all covered in mud will fly right into the tent and steal the stone. So will Vitya come back home then? He will... Should I gather some berries for him, for the road? Go ahead. Hey! Well, misfits, are you tired? Oh, you misfits! Stooop! Faster. Grandfather is there! They brought him, he s wounded! Grandfather! She was taken away. Who was taken away, grandfather? Olenka? Yes. Now we... Guys, come on! Grandfather, we ll take you to Milanka: she ll heal you! Don t! Leave me be. This is... this is my time. Save Olenka! I couldn t. I didn t manage. Save her, so that I could sleep better on the other side... Vitya! Too bad I won t see how our guys fly like vultures. And you have to overcome your fear. It s no good dragging it after you for your whole life. Grandfather, grandfather... forgive me: I took your apples... You son of a bitch. When are you gonna grow up, misfits? I forgive you... Grandfather... Grandfather?.. Grandfather! We ve caught him!.. Who are you? Me?.. Olenka. Lord, she had a sign... Don t! Take him away! Don t! Don t. What? Vitya?! Vitya! I ve got a plan. And grandfather! Where is grandfather? No! This can t be! No! The human dragon did the right thing! Hold it! Little devil, fill the stone with power! Do it! Okay, okay... But I need my backpack... Bag. I need my bag. Give it back. Now I m gonna do magic... What does he have in mind? This is some sorcery... London is the captial of Great Britain Who is absent today? Don't worry, be happy Either you do what is to be done, or she dies. I grant you another attempt... the last one. I ll do it. But promise you won t kill us. If you bring the stone to life, I won t kill either you or the girl. I give khan s word. Happy now? How... How do I bring you to life? Quick! Magus. What was he saying? That s it! Time is up! Vitya, come on... Heart to heart... Stop! Heart to heart. Heart to heart. Power is in the stone. Finally. We only have to thank our guests. You gave khan s word you won t kill us. I won t kill you. Call Tugarkan! Greetings, brother! Can you help me? Tugarkan help. I gave my word not to kill these two ones. And khan s word is the law! So do it for me... Kill them! Tugarkan no kill. Tugarkan... You don t want to make your brother sad, right? This will be your gift for me, brother. Gift... Yes. Gift. Don t let me down. Gift... Now the whole world will be at my feet! Vitya! Tugarkan! Forgive me! Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick! This is for you... A gift. Gift... Gift... How did you dare?! Brother! Gift, look, gift! You ve betrayed me! Gift. Looks like we ve run away. We can have a rest... Come on. How are you? Thanks for coming to get me. I couldn t leave you there. Oleshko? And we were just on the way to save you! I wanted to do it like this hop! I don t know what it was, but the noise was spectacular. That was something big. Then we ll have to fight not only cumans... We ll prepare serious weapons. We ve got little time. Let s get to work. Holy mother... The time has come! What is this monster? This is a golem. A huge stone warrior. Onwards! Where do we hit it? Keep calm. We know how to greet it. Fire! A fiery dude alright! More! Got you, skyscraper?! To the hiding place! Everyone to the hiding place! Can you swim, you piece of stone? We have to get people out. No need to get anyone out: I ll do everything. Oleshko! What are you going to do? Oleshko! What are you going to do? Oleshko! Oleshko! I ll go on my own now, Orlyk. And you, if I don t manage... tell Rosanka I love her! You ll tell her in some horse language of yours. And now go to the stronghold. The fairytaile knight from Rymiv goes into battle! Against... Are you a boy or a girl? Missed! I am here! What if I do this? Dude! You are not trying hard enough. Friend, maybe we should come for his rescue? No, wait... I think I understand what he s trying to do. Hey there! Move your stones! Veles, are you here?! Golem is done. Daughter! Oleshko... I ve come. You called me to come to the lake... and I did... He died like a real knight. Somebody died?! Oleshko? Oleshko! Alive! Alive, thank God! A cool one, for sure! Fairytale knights don t die! And stone idiots do! Look, a flower! Vitya! The sun... This is a celestial sign! Yes! This is the eclipse! You have to come back! Hurry to the horse! This is a good sign. Get ready. Olenka, I wanted to tell you... Here, take it. Well... this is it. What about the cumans? We ll deal with them. At least we brought the giant down. Goodbye... Come on, hey, hey, hey! Don t be sad, child... It has to be so. Goodbye... They noticed there was no gate! To the stronghold! Oleshko! To the mountain! Shields! Brothers, truth is behind us! Yeees! Power is behind us! Yeees! God is with us! Yeees! Because we re on our own land! We ll stand! Yeees! Here! Oh, that one flew out alright. Go back. Go back. Go back! What, have you torn up their saddles? Yeees! Golem. He has risen! He has risen! Oleshko, take children and women to grandfather s cellar: that stone won t reach them there for sure. So, friend, have we served Rymiv well? We have, friend. God has seen everything. We ll serve it for the last time. Everyone to grandfather s cellar! Here... Quick, quick. Come on, girls, come on, ladies. - Everyone there... everyone will fit... - What s gonna happen now? Vitko? Stop! I ve got an idea! Oleshko, help me. I m not here alone. I am not here alone! All of Rymiv is with me! I am not here alone! I am not... here... alone! - Go, go, go... - Oh my God, look! This can t be! I am flying! Cool! Oh dear God... Careful! On this land, which has always been ours, We live and love. Give it, my God, An angel with powerful wings. And when the hard times come, We won t fall down under black rain. We will stand side by side With our shields and swords. Olenka! That was cool, right? Give me the stone back. Give it back and I ll let you go. Come on. Fetch! You! I ve hardly managed to climb here. Almost fell twice. Andachyk! Listen, your Golem went all to pieces there. Go assemble it back. I ll kill you. I agree. That stone was loads of fun. Rosanka said, Use your head. Oh! That was good advice! You re done, skyscraper! Oleshko... I need to get to the Gloomy Rock immediately. No problem, dude! I am a fairytale knight! Yo! Come on, Vitko... Hop! Swinging dude! Bye, Oleshko. The coolest one among fairytale knights. True that. Well, take care. And you know what, tell Olenka... Vitya! Vitko, the hole, Vitko! I ll be waiting for you. Even if you never come back. I will. Look, he s gonna fall now! Someone! Help! Come on! I thought you got scared and I m done in. First I was scared... And then I was sucked in... And it started... I met the knights... I was checked in the marshes. We found Perun stone. Then cumans burned Stork Village down. We barely escaped. Grandfather was killed, Olenka kidnapped, we brought the stone to life, and golem appeared. We burned it, drowned it, but it still got out of the marshes. And then I jumped from the tower... on a deltaplane. I threw the stone into the water, ran into the hole, and you are here. What about me? Help me! Save me! Quick! Eh, Vovchyk. What s up with you?! We did it! Cool! Great job! One year later. Mom, not now. Mom! But you have to return it tomorrow morning. I... I ll manage in a couple of hours! And don t forget to have dinner. Mother, you re cool! Who finds that stone heart will meet his true love. Or find the lost one. Olenka... Vitko...
