Let's go. Where are we going, Boy? Boy. It's cold. We traveled for miles, from Jakarta to Amsterdam. Then took a road trip to Brussels, Belgium, the Europe Institute offices which gave our scholarships. But a small mistake stopped our struggle... and must be redeemed by cold air, below zero degrees. Wait here. I'll find some help. Boy! Your uncle is the most respectable man that I've ever known. Even the Dutch are powerless in front of him. But it was his hernia that made him lose the spirit of his life as a gentleman. Even his wife left him. And now, he isolates himself. He no longer cared about his life. He went to Mentawai by sailboat. He dived into the deepest sea, the dirty seas. Only him who dared to come to the haunted island of Lanun. Your uncle is... Uncle Weh! Weh! Weh! Why, Weh! Weh! Weh! - Weh. - You're still alive, Boy. You almost died. You buried me! - You are too much. - Compost. The Russian army used compost to survive. Luckily, I like reading history. If not, you'll die not achieving your dreams. MUHAMMADIYAH PRIMARY SCHOOL GANTONG My memory of Aling has never been erased. I still clearly remember her charming ring fingers like the most beautiful ruby red stone. Which is among the pile of treasure that are priceless. So, Boy, how are you? Very well thanks, ma'am. Thanks. You've chosen a Victor Hugo novel. Which one will you work on for the exercise? I chose Les Misérables. "Les Misérables." Les Misérables. And you, Ikal? I chose Notre-Dame de Paris, Mrs. Maron Leblancs. "Mauran Leblanc." Mauran Leblancs. "Mauran Leblanc." Ma... Don't embarrass the Indonesians. Boy. I really like it when she says her name. Nasal. Civilized. Classy and educated. Madame. Could you repeat it one more time, please? "Mauran Leblanc." Moron Leblancs. We tried learning the most difficult language fast. It's okay if we sprain our tongues. Due to the hard training to make a nasal voice. Sorry. What nonsense. Yes, ma'am. Not "yes", you sicko! Pervert! Why are you laughing? Why did you bring me here, huh? Do you think only lovers may come to this place? Friendship also has a place here. Hopefully by doing this, our friendship becomes eternal. Throw it. My brother. Let go. Let's go. Sorbonne University. Now in front of my eyes. I will start half of my dream. As you know, we've been suffering an economic crisis since 2008... My classmates came from various countries. I wonder what destiny made me gather with other students from underdeveloped countries. Gonzales, from Mexico. He is very confident that Latino men are the most macho in the world. You will need my help. Because the strongest help the weakest. Understand? - Yes. - See you soon, my friend. Okay? Manooj, from India. He felt he had an inner bond with me. Many of his family live in Indonesia. And become a film producer from every generation. Great movies in your country. Into sex. And the only woman, Ninochka from Georgia. She doesn't talk much, but was deadly! She got a scholarship because she was a chess grand master. - Check mate! - No! She gave the four of us a nickname, Pathetic Four. A group of four people who are pathetic. The learning euphoria struck Arai and me in Sorbonne. Hoarding reference books for ourselves, we are competed in reaching our dreams. Tear down the sturdy building of evolutionists. I like your spirit. Your world is your world. My world is my world. I know why you're not interested. Because you haven't evolved from apes to humans. You haven't evolved either. Still have that mental illness number 10. Slowly but surely, I changed to a zealot of classical economics fanatic Adam Smith's teachings. - Too much. - Bro Rhoma? Agreed. Money rules in today's world Bro Rhoma, what do you think? Okay, for those who are young and stylish... Everyone is equal, heave-ho Roll up your sleeves, if we want to move forward. Boy. Boy! Okay, Bro Rhoma. Everyone is equal, heave-ho. Boy, geez. We can see the increase in demand is strongly correlated to the directors' rate. A sharp decrease in rates systematically increases growth but could cause a big inflation risk. Well done. Gonzales, what do you think? - Gonzales! - What, ma'am? Your opinion. Oh, gosh, ma'am! Oh, ma'am! No, I want your team leader's answer. We're listening, Gonzales. I don't think he has an opinion, actually. So, the biology student! What's up, Manooj? Classes are getting too much? - What's up? - Good. You? You good? We need to think of a topic to criticize developed countries with. What then? What do you think? And you, Gonzales? You have a story. Today, information rules the world. Before, it was oil. In the 6th century, it was spices. In the olden days, you could only grow them in Indonesia. Exotic produce. I have an idea. You plan the project because it was your country that was colonized for the longest. So was yours, Gonzales. Damn it! I just wanted to get you to do the work. Whoa. You should get Manooj to do the work. That might teach him a bit about gender equality. I'm all for gender equality. Especially for those two chicks there. You're not a rook. You're a pawn. Good for nothing. Life in Paris is not cheap and easy. Our scholarship just enough for everyday life. We do any part-time jobs, like a squirrel who is very busy collecting nuts. With all our wits, we managed to arrange our class and working schedules. Boy, why do I have to be a mermaid? Our theme today is about the environment. A sad mermaid because of the sea exploitation. I'm an environmentalist too. But why mermaids that are synonymous with women and tears? I just realized it. Hey, Ikal. There's police! Although little, we still send money to Belitung. Pension fund of a tin worker like my dad isn't even 100,000 rupiah per month. Even then, there are no raise in years. POST OFFICE Thank you, sir. - Please sign here, sir. - Here? RECEIPT OF MONEY - Put one million into my savings. - Okay, sir. I also have to pay utilities. The rest in cash, please. You keep getting deliveries from Paris, huh? Right. - Filial children. - Right, sir. You see this? My son is in Paris. You must be proud, sir. You will not regret it, if one of my sons becomes your husband. - It is okay for us, sir? - Thank God. My child, thank you for your remittance yesterday. You can imagine your mother and father's happiness, but don't force yourself to send it again. Use it for your daily needs. Once in a while, I am still strong to fish from the Lenggang River for a side dish. That's enough for both of us. With this letter, my father delivered some other news. A few days ago, Jimbron came with his wife and son, who were only two months old. Their grass jelly cafe is thriving. Mrs. Muslimah is well and still teaches at Muhammadyah Primary School. But Mr. Mustar, your former headmaster, died a month ago, because of a serious illness. Now Mr. Ballia is replacing him. Don't forget our message, so that you two always keep your faith and carry out your religious obligations. "Our prayers are always for your happiness, blessing, safety and success." "Amen." Katya. But wait, Kayta! Katya! I can't live without you anymore. Katya, marry me! You'd inherit great riches! I'd cook for you! That's nice but I don't like tortillas. That's okay. I can make nachos! - She smiled at us, right? - Boy? That female student from Germany is the biggest distraction for men in Sorbonne. For some reason, Katya's gaze and smile made me want to find out Aling's whereabouts, look for credible information, and follow them to some cities. Where have you been? You're late. Looking for Aling. You've visited hundreds of addresses since you arrived in Paris. Remember, we're here to pursue dreams as... As Abalia said. I already know that. You don't need to keep repeating it. Your love is absurd. Love from primary school. For what? Beautiful nails? Love like that only lasts for three months. Hey, Boy! You know a little about literature. Short as elephant grass. Forgot the story from Koh Balung? Dante, fell in love with Beatrice at the age of nine. Eternal! Beatrice. Beatrice became the inspiration of all his poems until he died. He became the most famous Italian poet of all time. You're good at finding excuses. Maybe Aling has forgotten you too. You remember when I wrapped you in compost, you told me. Your smart uncle said... You're a man born in October. Listen, Ikal. You're a man born in October. A zenith and nadir man. You will be able to achieve your highest dream. That is you. For example. The flames of Mars and the cold currents. That can trap you. Don't let your memories of Aling becomes that flames of Mars and cold currents. How is my literary knowledge? We've lost out chance. That Italian guy will take her. It's over for us. You're so right. She's decided I'm the one. I think she was looking at me. Hey you, shall we get a drink? - My treat. - Sure. Look who's boss now. Checkmate! Aling is my first unforgettable love. But I don't know where she is, and Katya is only one inch ahead of me. Her aura was overwhelming, her gaze was gripping. It's true what Arai said. Like a banana compote, before breaking the fast. Why won't you kiss me? We're in public. But Paris is the city of love. I'm still learning. Aren't you funny? Yes. Boy! You know what happened? What? It's like a dream! Katya chose me! Just like that? Congratulation. Finally, someone wants you. Believe that love is blind now? What are you telling me about Katya? Please listen, Boy. She's tired of handsome men. Wants something different. Or is just farsighted. I knew it. I know. You feel jealous of me. Because no one likes you. I have Zakia Nurmala. Mental illness ranked seventh. You just enjoy your happiness now. Before she realizes her stupidity. Katya Katya Bro Rhoma. You're truly beautiful Give it Rhoma! - Peace be upon you. - Be upon you too. This sound so good. It's dangdut. Where are you going? An invitation to dinner with Katya. You should focus more on your studies. If you keep this up, I'm afraid you won't pass first semester. Boy. Relax. My grades are still enough. Eleven, 12, enough for graduation. Only aiming to graduate? We're here to pursue our dreams. You should strive to be the best. It's up to you. Not too late, okay? You're from Belitung. You know what's allowed and what's not. Hey, Boy. Bro Rhoma. He must agree with you! May peace be upon you. Thanks. That's so sweet. Come in, then. Aren't we eating out? I changed my mind. I ordered food in. Coming in? Yes. - Want something to drink? - Yes. - I'll put some music on. - Yes. You have a nice place. Thank you. I decorated it. I got everything from thrift shops. I love red. It's everywhere. Yes. Photos of my ex-boyfriends. Oh. I thought it was a soccer team. And that's not even all of them. I don't have your photo. Here. I'm sorry Katya. I don't drink alcohol. You don't have to drink it all. Just a sip. Ah, the food's here. There was a pious young man. Threatened to be killed if he couldn't do one of the three things that he had to do. First option, drink wine. Second, commit adultery. Third, killing. Then, in your opinion... which one did the young man choose? Surely he chose to drink wine. Because the sins are the lightest. You are mistaken. Because you can get drunk when you drink wine. When you're drunk, you can commit adultery. And you can kill too. So, the young man didn't choose any of the three. He prefers to die for what he believes in. Want some more? I've had enough, Katya. But we haven't toasted yet. Here. - Chin-chin! - Uh, Katya. It's your call. Get mad at me if you want. But I don't drink. I'll leave if you keep pressuring me. I threw the last one away. A man with principles. Sorry, Katya. I... I... I need to use the restroom. Thank you. Katya. Ikal! You're so pathetic, Boy. When people in our country are oppressed and starving, you think of love. "Boy, who thinks about love?" I'm tired of hearing your talk about politics. You know what is happening in our country? Unemployment everywhere. Corruption is increasing. People like our father can't do anything. That's not fair, Boy. Boy, I know you're a lighthearted person. You like to help others. But lately, you talk too much politics. Usually you are more action than talk. See and hear it yourself, you'll understand. Come with me tomorrow. You should come here more often. Join us here. Another coffee please, ma'am. From the news this morning, it shows that our country is almost ready to explode. Like a time bomb. And after exploding... we don't know what we would do then. What a shame. I just spoke to Mr. Handoko. Our country is more famous for its corruption than its natural beauty. Who doesn't know our country today? But only for its corruption. - Right? - Yes. Okay, please. Drink it. - I also think you should join them often. - Why? You said it yourself. We have to work hard. We here must learn to get the best knowledge. Our college grades are not enough to get a second-degree Masters next year. - You said it yourself. - That's right. But where's your sense of nationalism? They want our country to be better. Boy. You must be careful. I heard many people abroad incited and defamed their own country. What do you know about that? I sympathize with them. They are people who understand history. They can't return to the country they love. Do you know why? All because of politics. From them, I learned how to view injustice. I don't get it. There are too many rules. - He's gay. - No Gonzales. You just have to get used to the language. - I'd better get going. - Bye. - Get home safely. - Hey, Katya! Bye-bye. See ya. Katya, Katya! I'm so sorry about that night. You're right. I'm not who you thought I was. Let's just forget about it now. Let's just be friends. But are you okay, Katya? - Listen... - Hey, how are you? - Hey. - Good thanks. Let's bury the hatchet. My love life is messy enough as it is. Yes, I can tell. Given the number of boys' photos at your place. - No. - He's gay. - Never. - Of course he is. Why? What do you think love is? I don't know. It's like a TV channel. If you don't like the show, you channel hop. - Is that all it is to you? - Yes. What do you think love is then? For me, it's like a Bollywood movie. What are Bollywood movies like? They're dramatic, and poetic. And love is shown as something sacred, wonderful, healthy, but also with some sadness, joy, jealousy and hope. Wow. I'm touched to hear how you feel about me. In my country, we're taught to respect and cherish women. I'm traditional in that sense. If you want to make fun of that, then fine. You think I'm making fun of you? This is silly. Forgive me. It's okay if you want to end it. What? No, that's not it at all. Listen, I've been stupid. Oh yeah. I forgot. HEAVEN - EARTH A letter from Dad to us. My dear sons, there is an urgent matter that I want to tell you regarding a big problem which affects our families and also our village. Because the tin factory went bankrupt, there's not enough income for us tin workers. After that, we tried to farm together. But the land around our village is full of rocks. And former mining companies, they don't care about our fate. So, we also failed together. I'm just thinking, suppose you two can be with us right now... this burden will feel more lighter. But I understand you two are pursuing your dreams abroad. I only have hopes, my sons. Prayers from your mom and dad. - What do you think? - I can't. With all due respect for Father, I can't. Our journey has come too far. But you, it's up to you. You are an adult. You can take a decision. That night, I didn't let go of the sarong that my father had given me when I left. The sarong exudes an enormous scent of affection. Makes my breath feel tight. My guilt fades slightly, treating my longing to my mom and dad. Hey! Are you okay? You seem sad. I received some bad news from home. And I didn't get good grades this semester. I need motivation to study more. I don't get it. You Asians take studying too seriously. Your results are still better than most. Look at them. They don't give a damn. They're having fun. They were malnourished as children. What do you mean? Never mind. Shall we? Hey! Ikal! Where are you going this summer? I was going to tour Europe with Arai. But I'm still not sure. If you're at a loose end, you're welcome at my place in Germany. Every day I was hit with odd feelings. I think of Aling every time I was near Katya. A dozen years of my first love locked inside me. So strong and beautiful. Evoking the same joy like a child playing with fireworks at the night market. Love who has invited me to write poems full of rhythm. Where did you go? Why? Seeing my grades without asking? That is unethical. You put it carelessly. Since when is there secrets between us? Is it because your grades are bad? We didn't come here to have fun, Boy. I'll fix it. I've met my tutor. It won't do if you're busy with your love life. Hey, what? Why do you have to get mad? Who do you think you are? My father? Mr. Bania? Mrs. Muslimah? I am an adult. I know what is good and bad. You mind your own business! I don't want to know your things too. But I'm responsible for my promises. Hey, Boy! I'm sick of it. You always treat me like a child. You always put me in a weak position. Like a cocoon that needs constant protection. You always want to be better! Be a hero! - That's what you think? - Yes. Fine. I won't interfere. Take care of yourself! I am disappointed in you! Come on, hurry up. You're so slow. Boy, I'm thirsty. Don't be spoiled. Malay men must be strong. Come on, let's go! I'm can't stand anymore. I'll just break my fast. It'll be time for that soon. You have to be strong. You have to be strong. Boy. Are you sleeping? Boy. I'm sorry, Boy. No need to say sorry. You are not mistaken. I will not interfere in your business, as per your wish. You are not mistaken. You are not a kid. I'm not your teacher, nor your father either. Boy. You know, besides my parents... you are the most influential person in my life. Thanks. Boy. It's summer vacation soon. We have dreams to explore the world. I crossed out that dream. I have another dream. Boy? Lintang, why don't you go to school again? I have to make a living for myself and my siblings after Dad died at sea. But I leave all those dreams to you. Also the dreams of Laskar Pelangi kids. Mrs. Muslimah. Mr. Harfan. If you succeed in pursuing those dreams, that also becomes my success, Kal. We'll all be happy. Thanks, Lintang. I will do my best. You can do it, Boy. I'll pray every time I go out to sea. Lintang! When Aling left... I felt that everyone in Belitung had left using Noah's boat. Only me, who was not invited. It's the same when I saw my uncle die on the mast of a boat. Now I feel abandoned by Arai. I have understood every word about the beauty of Edensor village from Aling's book. I have read it countless times. Every time I do, my yearning lessens. A village gate with a spinning rooster spun by gusts of wind. Rural roads that go uphill and are full of twists. Decorated with oak tree rows, alternating with vines that grow wild. Honey bees buzz around petunias. Daffodils and asterias growing along the farm. Growing tightly between the stone benches. The roofs of the houses were filled with orange leaves. Swaying by caresses of the wind. Then the vast expanse of grassland. Its surface scattered by cotton clouds. Something about you has changed. I miss your little smile. That's not the smile I know. I'm sorry, Katya. I need to be honest with you. What is it? Go on. Your style of love is sophosticated. I mean, it's modern. While my style is traditional. Maybe even old-fashioned. Right, so what? It's hard for me to keep up with your love. So you don't love me then? Katya. I'm so sorry. Don't be sorry. It's not your fault. At least you're being honest. We must be. Well, of course. You see love in Indian movies, but I only watch American ones. It's hard to adapt. Honesty, I'm relieved. Come on, it's no big deal. They're not even this dramatic in Indan movies. We'll still be friends. As if nothing happened. Okay? Now you kiss me? I've lived here for 40 years. And during that time, I have never returned to Indonesia. In fact, I miss my hometown. I want to die there. Want to be buried there. About your friend. He has a heart that is easily touched by the difficulties of others. There's a friend he wanted to help to go home. But I know it is difficult for him as a student with only a mediocre scholarship. He is helpless. He became angry with himself because... he cannot help more. It seems that he's usually resourceful. But this time, he found a dead end. Thanks. A little more and we'll reach home. You can do it. Hey! Where are you going? Boy! Hey, what's with you? Going to cancel your fasting? I am thirsty. I can't take it anymore, Boy. - We'll do that soon. - But I want to drink, Boy. - Don't give up! - Our house is far from here. - I can't walk anymore. - I'll carry you! Boy, what are you doing? You won't break the fast if I carry you. Don't do this. Please stop it, Boy. Just put me down. You must be tired. - It may break your fasting. - Relax. I am strong. When I was young, I got the vaccine. Me too. You think I didn't get the vaccine when I was young? That's why you should be strong. You're the only one who feels weak. I realize more now, Arai is an inseparable part of my life. I've hurt him. Now I feel lame, like a kite with a unbalanced string. Not balanced. Boy. I want to apologize to you. It's my fault. You were right. I'm an ungrateful person. Do you remember my story? I almost died. Since my father and mother died. I'm the only child in my family, the last one. For many days... living alone. I felt scared, Kal. After that, you and your father came to pick me up. I saw your sadness. I hid my sadness and fear. I caught a beetle for you. You laughed. Beetle. That's very sweet. I don't know how you could catch that rare insect. You two are the most important people since then. I'll do anything to repay the affection that you two gave. Because of that, I set my dreams very high. Set your dreams as high as the sky. Because God will embrace your dreams. Those are your words. Without dreams... that is a tragedy for humans. You two are my only family, Kal. I'd to do anything for you guys. We got through many things. You, me, Jimbron. I know you are right. I'm being overprotective towards you. I'm sorry. I'm the one to apologize. I was wrong. I am very grateful to you. I don't know what will happen if I don't have you by my side. You'll still be a great person, Kal. I'm sure of it. Really, Arai is a bodyguard with a big heart. Rummaging and encouraging a cowardly soul. He took care of me and taught me. For him, pessimism is poisonous and deadly. Like a poisonous ghost. His fighting spirit is as hard as mountain rocks. Arai and I once again felt the pleasure of entering the Sorbonne gate. Full of vigor. The euphoria of learning struck us again. We had to finish all our thesis. Our struggle was not in vain. We graduated the first semester. We have achieved half of our dreams. Happiness is felt throughout our entire body. Now was the time to continue the second semester. And trying to get a scholarship. Here. In the presence of Jim Morrison's tomb I testified. Yes! Take my soul! Steal my future! Rob me. Grab everything! Seizure! Seizure! But why you've never loved me? Zakia Nurmala! - Jim Morrison! - Yes! - Arai Morrison! - Yes! Boy, finally you can vent your seventh craziness. Madness number seven! What an unfortunate fate for Zakia Nurmala! If she finds out you embarrassed her just now. My first vow was done. Pilgrimage to the tomb of Jim Morrison. I'll propose to Zakia Nurmala in my second year. Damn you! Zakia. Come on, baby, light my fire Come on, baby, light my fire Zakia. Come on, baby, light my fire Ani! - Hi, Ikal. How are you? - Hi, good thanks. What's wrong with you? Aling is in Paris, Boy. This is a letter from Akiong. And these are from Aling from the last five years. Akiong found the letters, which were hidden by her parents. Look at this, Boy. She said she wanted to try to forget me, because I don't care about her anymore. Boy, Aling still loves me. Beatrice and Dante's love is repeated? Why are you zoning out? Want to look for Aling? Come on! Aling did her internship with us for three months. I heard she moved to the USA for work. No news since then. I think she changed phone numbers. But... I have her friend's phone number. - Are you ready? - Yes. Disconnected! - Why are you laughing? - Do you see the address? - Boy, this is close to our house. - One block. Come on, Boy. Let's go, Boy! Again? Unkown caller. Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am. Do you live here? I'm looking for Aling's friend. Oh, no! I mean... - Are you Indonesian? - Right. The person you are looking for just left. Do you have the phone number? - The one I have can't be reached. - I don't. Sorry. She's found. Just wait here. She'll come back later. You can't wait for it. They'll be gone a long time. One tours Europe, the other returns to Indonesia. Gosh, Boy! Where are they going now? Airport or some other place? Please, ma'am. His madness number seven relapses otherwise. Don't embarrass me. Send my regards to those in Indonesia. Yes, of course. Boy, let's split up. Hey, I don't know what Aling looks like now. So don't I. Just look for the most beautiful nails. Hey, what kind of nails? Must find the most beautiful nails. Ling? Aling? No, no, no. Boy, that's Aling's train. Damn! At least Aling exists and still loves you. You're after an amazing dream, Boy. You will see next time. Even now we don't know for sure where she is, I feel more confident, my distance to Aling is reducing. My feelings now the same as when I first saw her nails. Like being embraced by Lenggang River's current, swimming with dolphins. Picked up by millions of fireflies, then flown to the stars. Friends, me and Arai's story doesn't end there. I don't want to be like a squirrel busy carrying nuts. Or like a turtle hiding inside his shell. Or a snail hiding behind its shell. I want to go to places far away. Encounter a variety of languages and foreigners while collecting traces of Aling's whereabouts. I want to navigate the fields and deserts. I want to feel the sun. Swayed by the wind. And shrank by cold air. I want to wander and find my direction by reading stars. As taught by my uncle. I want to taste the essence of life. I'll be a zenith man, an October man on top of the sky. I will not let the fires of Mars and the cold winds of Pluto trap me, and drag me down. Although I know, in the end, I had to dock in a quiet and peaceful place. With people who love me and who I also love. Will that be in Edensor? Will it be with Aling? I was just a village kid who had only dreams. Laskar Pelangi from Belitung dreamed of exploring the world. Life is a journey. A journey that we'll never know its direction. But the journey always follows our footsteps. A dream that brings us all, enjoying the beauty of life. Dreaming is the beginning of goals. Keep dreaming, until God embraces our dreams.
