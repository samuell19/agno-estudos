[roaring] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music] [crowd yelling] [dog barking] [speaking in Swahili] It's back again. [lion growling] [chickens clucking] [goat bleating] [chickens clucking] [goat bleating] [lion growling] Put me through to Dr. Tracy. The lines are down? Give me the drum. [drumming] [birds chirping] [monkeys chattering] [roaring] That's what they said, doctor. That's right-- Daddy, isn't that lion the most-- Alright, I want Irwin to get as much antibiotics as possible. Now what's this about this crazy lion? That's what the drums have been saying all morning. The lion went in with the goat and the goat came out without a scratch. Honey, put Irwin down. I think he's had enough. Did he, uh...he go after any children? No, doctor. - Hmm, dogs? - No, doctor. - Chickens? - No, doctor. [leopard growling] Alright, Abner, this won't hurt at all. Well, if that's true. Daddy, it is. The drums wouldn't lie. Well, it's a pretty wild story. But, uh, we oughta check it out. Do you know where this lion was seen? - Yes. It was-- - The dry river. Let's go see if we can find a lion that behaves like a lamb. Husseini, put the little one back in its cage, will you? Ndio, memsahib. Oh, Husseini, when memsahib Julie Harper comes for supplies tell her we'll be right back. Ndio, bwana. Let's stop and pick up some dead meat. Dead meat? For a lion? Obviously he can't hunt, so we'll put him to sleep with a few grains of chlorpromazine and find out why. Hop in. [engine revving] [no audio] Well, what do you know? There's Sheila. You know, I haven't seen her since her last inoculation. [rhinoceros snorting] She looks fit, daktari. Didn't Sheila have a bad temper? Oh, no worse than any rhino. You know, I think I'll go over and see if she remembers me. I hope she doesn't remember daddy. She hated those shots. You can never tell about a rhino, Miss Paula. [rhinoceros snorting loudly] Daddy! Yeah, she remembered me. [laughing] [rhinoceros snorting] [lion growling] Well...he's found the meat. Juma, let me have those glasses, will you? Yes, daktari. Well, I'll be... So that's it. Take a look. Daddy, he's cross-eyed. Yep, no wonder he can't hunt properly. He can't focus his eyes. We'll take him to the compound. - See what we can do for him. - Oh, good. It looks like the first square meal he's had in a long time. That meat won't hurt him, will it? Oh, no. It'll just put him to sleep nice and peacefully. There. See? [gorillas grunting] [grunting continues] [birds chirping] What's that? It's from a camera. I don't like cameras. Or people who use them. Boss, look at the size of that footprint. Yes. It's either from a very small man. Or from a woman. Now, I want you to wait for me right here. Don't move. Stay. [Doris chattering] - Good morning, Miss Harper. - Hi. Come on, Doris. Come on. [faint growl] [shrill screech] Well, leave it to Marsh Tracy to find a character like you. Well, maybe we could operate or something. I don't know. You know about all those things. Don't you, daddy? I mean, cross-eyes isn't... Cross-eyes aren't. Cross-eyes isn't or cross-eyes aren't, daddy? Call it Internal Strabismus, honey, and you can't go wrong. Well, whatever you said. It isn't incurable, is it? No, honey. But it's a long process. And besides, he's gotta get used to people first. Good, then after he's tame I can keep him as a pet and specialize in lions. Like Julie and her gorillas. But none of my gorillas are cross-eyed. [both] Julie. - You have a good trip down? - Yes. - How's it going up there? - Fine. The family's fine too. Now, stay there, Doris. The silverback male with the scar on his nose has finally gotten used to me. The skinny female is skinny again. She's had a baby. Oh, good. Mother and daughter doing well. Have you seen our lion? - Oh, have I? - 'You have, haven't you.' Daddy's gonna try and cure his cross-eyes and I'm gonna keep him. Wanna play some chess? Come on, Paula. Give Julie a chance to get her breath. - Come, sit down. A drink? - I'd love it. - Husseini. Pink gin? - Pink gin. [speaking in Swahili] I'll do it. Ah. Fill me in. How's it been going? - Oh, fine. - Good. I'm right in among them now. and they pay me no attention. [Doris chattering] Thank you. - Right? - Good. Husseini made a chocolate cake especially for you. We'll have it for dessert. Well, if you can get that box away from Doris. That's for you. I picked up at the post office on the way in. Oh, thank you, Julie. What is it? I bet it's the snap-on diapers for my baby baboon. Well, honey, why don't you open it and see? [Doris chattering] Oh-h. That was very nice of you, Julie. Thanks. [Doris chattering] There must be something that goes here. Hmm. Oh-h! [chattering continues] [lion growling] There. That's much more sensible. Oh, nuts. [Doris laughing] Paula, need any help? Oh, no, thank you. I'm doing fine. That oughta shake 'em. How do I look? Well, honey, uh-h. You-you look...you look.. Seductive, daddy? Very seductive. Thank you, Julie. Ouch. Ah. Growing pangs. [Doris chattering] [lion growling] Wait a minute, Husseini. I want another piece. Paula, that's the third piece you've had. I thought the cake was for Julie. [Julie] 'That's alright.' It's for later. [Julie] 'That was very good cake, Husseini.' Thank you, memsahib. She's got a sweet tusk. Uh-h, incidentally, young lady. Isn't it...uh, about time for you to hit the sack. Oh, gee. Thanks, dad, for reminding me. [dramatic music] [lion growling] Alright, I'm coming. [lion growling] [growling continues] "Abilard, Alan, Alice?" Oh, golly, that won't do. Would it? How about "Aloyisius"? "Billingham, Berti, Bertam, Bernard." Oh, no, you can't have that. That's our ostrich. Well, "Cecil?" "Cedric?" What about "Clarence?" Oh, you like that, don't you? Cut it out. That tickles. Well, Clarence it is! From now on, you're Clarence, aren't you? The cross-eyed lion. Hey, that has a nice ring to it. Hey, come on, stop pushing. Come on, Clarence. Go to sleep. I better get back to bed 'cause I'm a growing young women and I'm not supposed to prowl around at night anymore. Well, Clarence. Good night. [faint growling] Cut it out, Clarence. Mary Lou! Mary Lou. You know you're not allowed out at this time of night. Now, you get in here and go to sleep. And don't forget to leave Mr. Rowbotham alone when he comes tomorrow. Oh! When he comes today. [Doris honks] [Marsh] Leavin' already? Mornin'. Yes, got to get back to camp. It's a long drive. Come on. Where's Paula? - Why? Is she up? - Yes. She was up before I was. Oh-h. Well, then, I know where she is. Stay! Stay there, Doris! [Doris chatters] [Clarence roaring] [Doris honking] [Marsh] Paula, you're too close. Oh, it's alright, daddy. He knows me now. [Paula] 'Could I move him closer to the house?' Then, if he needs something tonight, I.. Is that alright, daddy? He'll be good for her. Every child should have a little pet. His name's Clarence, and he likes it. And I'm not a child anymore. [Clarence growling] Do you think he has double vision? No, I don't think so. But I haven't had a chance to examine him yet. [Clarence growling] But we can keep him, can't we? Well, with a name like Clarence. We wouldn't dare turn him loose, would we? Oh, good. I'll have him eating out of my hands in a few weeks. Okay. [honking continues] You're a good boy, Clarence. Doris, don't be so impatient! - Well, see you next month. - Right. - Come back! - Just take it easy, huh? Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Julie. It brightens the day when Julie is here, doesn't it? Yep. Those gorillas of hers, don't know how lucky they are. The word's yes, darling. Not yep. Yes, daddy. Daddy, did mommy know Julie? Oh, no, honey. Why? She would've liked Julie very much. - Yep. - The word's yes, daddy. Why does she spend so much time up in the forest? Well, that's her work, honey. I worry about her. It must be terribly dangerous. Oh, there's no danger. Nothing up there except gorillas. Come on, I'm hungry. [intense music] [birds chirping] [whistles] [music continues] [loads rifle] [upbeat music] [music continues] [Marsh] Paula! Get your basket. She's done it again. Come on, Juma. Mary Lou, will you give up and come down? Or I'll make you into a handbag. How would you like that? [Paula] 'Mary Lou, stop scaring Mr. Rowbotham.' 'Or I'll never get an education.' Now stop pouting. Come on down. That's a nice girl. [Paula] 'There, that's much better.' 'Just curl up and think about behaving yourself.' There we go. Uh! Alright, Rupert. You can come down now. Are you sure, it's gone? [Marsh] 'Yes, it's quite safe. Come on down.' Thank you very much. [Clarence growling] Uf! Uh! Paula, you promised me you'd tell that-that animal to stop stalking me. She isn't stalking you, Mr. Rowbotham. She just loves you. Then her affection is totally misplaced and entirely unreciprocated. Rupert, I'm afraid animals just naturally take to you. Why I continue to come here of all places? I really don't know. One calamity after another. Inflicted on a weak uncomplaining body that only wants to be left alone. [sighs] Where are my things? Oh. Now, Paula. Did you do the lessons I left with you? Yes indeed, Mr. Rowbotham. [Rupert] Well, that's something. I was rather heroic, wasn't I? No, not really. [Rupert sighs] I found one or two mistakes in your last week's English lesson, Paula. Oh, dear. Uh, sit like a lady, dear. For example, define the word "platonic" for me. It means people who like each other but don't smooch and stuff. Like daddy and Julie. Not a very articulate definition. And the most improper remark to boot. Now, uh, and the plural of octopus. Well, octopuses, I suppose. No, no, no. Octopi. [Clarence burping] Good heavens. What was that? Oh, wind. Phew. Oh. Now, I wonder if you would be so kind. After all, your lungs are somewhat younger than mine. [laughs] I love a little joke. [blowing] [hen clucking] [blowing continues] [Marsh] 'Paula.' Honey, I thought you'd like to know. Erwin's responded to the antibiotics and he's gonna be fine. Well, Rupert, he's really quite harmless. It is a firmly established tenet of my philosophy that no, absolutely no animal is harmless. Oh, well, uh, uh, forgive me for interrupting. [Clarence growling] You know, we really have to do something about his indigestion. After the lesson I'll give him some milk of magnesia. Well, that oughta help. [blowing continues] Thank you, but there is nothing wrong with my, uh, digestion. [blowing continues] Well, if you are quite ready with my globe. Phew! Now, where were we? [Rupert] 'Oh, yes, of course. Uh, the plural of octo..' 'May I have your attention?' The plural of octopus is octopi. Hippopotamus, hippopotami. Cactus, cacti. Stimulus, stimuli. Radius, radii. Appleus, apple-pie? And we can manage quite nicely, thank you. Without the gratuitous flippancy. - Gratuitous, gratuiti? - That was rather cheeky. [Rupert] 'And now for geography. Don't fidget, dear.' Paula, pay attention. [Rupert] 'Now, uh. Where are we?' Please, don't fidget. We'll start with, uh, Istanbul. 'It's a nice bright blue. Don't fidget, Paula.' Look, can't we go to Africa this week, Mr. Rowbotham? I'm tired of China and Europe and all those dreary places. Paula, your knowledge of Africa I fear is limited to a somewhat distressing affinity with its fauna. An affinity which I personally can only regard 'as alarming in the extreme.' [laughs] Now, one reason for my own, uh, intellectual equipoise. Lies in my constant and determined avoidance of all contact with the animals. This is a cardinal point of my philosophy. Which I feel you might do very, very well to emulate. You mean I should be like you, Mr. Rowbotham? Oh, well. Example is the most rational form of education. But the animals love me, Mr. Rowbotham. Come to think of it, they love you, too. Precisely why I will continue to regard them. Uh! I beg you pardon. With a sensible and proper suspicion and avoid all personal contact with them whatsoever. Oh, this heat! We must remember that in the animal kingdom man is served.. [Clarence roaring] ...for dinner. Oh! [Clarence growls] [hens clucking] [roster doodles] Ah-h! Mr. Rowbotham! [serene music] [Husseini] 'Bwana.' [speaking in Swahili] Oh, no! Now come on, Clarence. Get out of there. Now don't be so damned pig-headed! Come on. Out. Come on, Clarence. Come on. Get out. Come on. Come on. Good boy. Now you stay there. Paula! Paula? Come on, honey. Shake a leg. Oh, no. Get him out of there. Alright, Clarence. I've got dibs on the front seat. Come on, Clarence. There. Now go over there. [faint growling] Ah...alright, I give up. Unhook him. A fine how-do-you-do. [music] [Clarence growls faintly] The water level looks pretty good. Yeah. Well, let's go take a look, huh? [Paula] Now behave yourself, Clarence. And stay there. Well, we have our usual herd of wildebeests and zebra. [Marsh] 'Two or three oryx.' And about a half a dozen Tommy gazelles. Two or three kongoni. [Marsh] 'Hey, hey! Look here. It's a greater kudu.' A couple of young giraffes. [upbeat music] And one father. Now stay there, Doris. Come on, turn around, baby. Yeah, there you are. Here, let me see. Oh, Doris, I don't like the look of that. I think you need a doctor. I better get you to Marsh Tracy right away. Come on. Now, I want you to wait for me right here. [Marsh] We've got enough holes for the new fence, now. [man shouting] - What'd he say? - I'm not sure. [speaking in Swahili] Something about a girl in a pit. A girl in a pit with a leopard. - A leopard? - A leopard. Let's go! [tribal music] [speaking in Swahili] [speaking in Swahili] Huko! Huko! Huko! [female screaming] [leopard snarling] [female screaming] Gr-r-r. [Marsh] Get the net. [Marsh] Try to separate 'em. Get on the other side. [screaming] [growling loudly] [screaming continues] [speaking in Swahili] Your hand. Give me your hand. [speaking in Swahili] [leopard growling] Juma, get the net over the leopard. [leopard growling] I'll give him a hypo and take him back with us. [growling] [leopard snarling] Daktari,I'm coming! [Marsh] Juma, get him. Get the hypo! Shoot it. Doctor Tracy, I think you need a doctor. Yeah. Thanks, Juma. And take it easy. That's a little sore, honey. Now, take it easy there. I should put a couple of stitches in that. No, no. It's not that serious. Tape will be fine. You've stitched up animals before and you've always said-- I know, I've stitched up animals. But I'm a doctor. I say tape. Now, just. - Uh-h! God! - That oughta hold it. I wonder who that could be? - Hi. - Julie. Hey, this is a pleasant surprise. Marsh, what happened to your arm? Had a little fight with a leopard. Nothing serious. What am I saying? It hurts like the devil. - Would you give me a hand? - How many stitches? Are you kidding? Adhesive tape. No! Stay away from Doris. She has thrush. It's contagious. She does? Well, let's have a look then. Come on now, Doris. Open up. Open...oh. That's a good girl. You do have a little spot there. Yeah, now, come on over here with me. We'll take you to the hospital and fix you right up. Come on. Come on. Come on, Barbara. Come on, Barbara. Hey, Juma, you wanna take Barbara out? - Makes this patient nervous. - Right, doctor. Paula, get some swabs, will you? And the boric acid solution. Here now, Doris. Sit down. There. When we catch it in time. It is easy enough to cure. - Think we are in time? - Oh, sure. It's a good thing you brought her straight down though. - She's only got a little spot. - Poor Doris. Oh, Paula run down to the house and make some of your special medicinal porridge? That'll cure her if anything will. Ah-ah, hands! Here, here. That should do it. You'll be your sweet self inside an hour. Good. Hey, it's raining. We made it just in time. [thundering] Don't forget to disinfect. How's the hot water? I'd really love a bath. It's good and hot. And it is all yours. And a hot bath for everybody. That's enough hot water, Husseini. Ndio, memsahib.

You look pretty. That color suits you. Goodnight, daddy. Goodnight, honey. Sleep tight. Julie, um... I was wondering. Yes? How much longer you gonna be up there? - That depends on you. - Oh. Well, on the foundation. How are we doing for funds? Oh, well. There's no problem there. Julie. Yes? Would you care for a cigarette? No, thank you. Drink? No. Comfortable? Yes. - Anything I can get for you? - No, thank you. Paula's right. That, uh...color does suit you. [door knock] Hey, there's someone at the front door. I'll get it. Excuse me. Golly, daddy, are you a drag? Mr. Rowbotham! Uh, my motor car is playing silly buggers. I wonder if I might.. [Paula] 'Golly, Mr. Rowbotham, I'm sorry about what happened.' 'I mean, Clarence and all that. It was rather--' Paula, Paula, Mr. Rowbotham is waiting to come inside. - 'Daddy, I was trying to say-'' - 'Yes, honey I know, but--' [sneezes] Can't you apologize inside? After all Mr. Rowbotham is soaking wet! I was hoping you might notice. Oh, Mr. Rowbotham, just don't stand there. Come on in. Yes, sir, uh...we'd better fix you up with a spot of brandy. Brandy? Oh, my goodness, no. I never touch hard liquor. We have some food on the table or I can make hot cinnamon wine before you catch a cold. You better change these wet clothes. Lemme-- - Don't. No. No. No. - I won't peek, honest. If I could, uh, just have a blanket. Yes. Paula, will you get Mr. Rowbotham a blanket? Come on, Rupert. Sit down and have some food. Doris, time for medicine. - Evening. - Oh, good evening. - There. - Good evening, madam. Oh. Paula, help Mr. Rowbottom with his food. Uh, uh, Paula. Miss Harper, if I have told you once I have told you a hundred times, or at least twice. My name is Rowbotham. With a "t" and an "h" as in pith helmet. Of course, I beg your pardon. Mr. Rowbotham. Exactly. Uh, and another thing. One facet of man's superiority over the animals is his ability to use tools. As I think you will agree. Including spoons. So, if you'll permit me to feed myself. Thank you very much. This is really... quite delicious. You see, she can use tools too. Oh! Uh, uh, dear lady. That, uh, ape is aping me. [laughs] Oh, I do love a good pun. You know, I have never really liked porridge before. What is this, uh, Quaker Oats? No. Bamboo shoots, cassava roots plantain bark, wild mushroom and elderberry, all ground up and moistened with sour milk and castor oil. This is for this patient. Well, I think perhaps, if I could just have that, uh, cinnamon drink? Did she say "castor oil?" Well, it's good for you, Rup. Only good, Dr. Tracy, for a condition with which I am happy to say I am not at the moment afflicted. Oh. Ah, well done, Paula. She takes more after her father every day. Ah, girl children always want to take after their fathers. That is what makes the work of an itinerant educator so very, very difficult and unrewarding. Isn't that rather a lot? Daddy says it's the best cure for a head cold. The more, the merrier. Well, I don't think it will do me the slightest good. Mr. Rowbotham, you're a skeptic. Intelligent skepticism, sir, is the only way to intellectual chastity. [Marsh] 'Quite.' Well, I must say, it's really quite surprisingly tasty. Amazing. It's good. Ah. Do you think you really should? Oh, well, if you insist. Phew! Really, it's getting quite muggy, isn't it? Oh, thank you very much. To very good health.

[hens clucking] [Clarence growls] [Carter] Where's Dr. Tracy? Well, hello, Carter. Hello, Tracy. What on earth are you doing now? [Carter] 'I always wondered how the Leopard got his bloody spots.' [Marsh] 'Well, now you know.' Can't be much future, old boy, for a chap who goes around painting leopard's rumps. What? Well, you see, when he's released 'any ranger who spots him will report his movements.' [Marsh] 'That's how we keep track of his migratory habits.' We've gotta keep tabs on as many of the animals as we can. Really? What an extraordinary waste of effort. Well, Carter. We're extraordinary people. No hope for the human race. Be back in a minute, Juma. [growling] Well, what are you doing up here, Carter? Oh, nothing much, really. Just, uh, passing through. Is, uh, Julie Harper still here? Julie? No. She's gone back to her camp. You missed her by a couple of days. Just my luck. Heard she was here. Hoped I might find her. What the heck's she doing up there, anyway? She's carrying on her late husband's work. And he was one of the finest anthropologists in the country. Why don't you marry her? It's hard for a widower bringing up a daughter all on your own. [laughing] What are you trying to do, Carter? Play cupid or something? Come on. You'd make a good pair. Probably come up with a brood of baby gorillas. Ha! That's rather funny, isn't it? No, not really. That's the trouble with you Americans. You got no sense of humor. [Marsh laughs] Extraordinary. Is that natural or did you do it? It's unnatural. I didn't do it. Well, I wouldn't put it past you. [Clarence growls] Short on manners, too. Seriously, Carter. Something's cooking. Now, what is it? Well, I'm on my way to pick up a squad of askaris. There's a major-bloody battle looming up. Fun and games for everybody. Come, wash the dust out of your throat and tell me. Jolly good idea. I thought you'd never ask me. [Marsh laughs] Well, now, Carter. What's all this about a bloody-major battle looming? You ever run across this offensive fellow? Armand Gregory. Caucasian. Age, 39, height, 6 feet 2. Eyes blue, weight 13 stones 6. No, I only know him by reputation. Bit light on that gin, old boy. Oh, I'm sorry. There we go. - What happened to the arm? - Oh, a leopard. You've got to expect that in your line of business. - Yeah. Thanks for the sympathy. - Oh, not at all. - Now, what's this about Julie. - Julie? Julie Harper? Oh! Julie Harper. It seems our much wanted friend Gregory, was seen up here. On the Ulinzi River. Well, that's exactly where Julie is. Yes. Bit of a sticky wicket, isn't it? We picked up one of his men a while back and the miserable fellow talked his head off. Seems Gregory's planning to trap as many gorillas as he can here. - Gregory's not a poacher. - He is now. The last six months Gregory's been fighting with a band of rebels up north. They finally kicked him out and he is on the loose with twenty of his mercenaries, armed and looking for trouble. The only thing they haven't go, is money. You know what a young gorilla fetches on the open market? Yes. About five or six thousand dollars. With a mob like that behind him Gregory can trap 15 or 20 young gorillas and pick himself up the quickest little fortune you could wish for. And then, with men, arms and money, Gregory's goin' to be a considerable thorn in the administration's side. Better get up there and get Julie out. No rush, old boy. He's made a rendezvous with his men for the 25th. That's when they start the drive and when the trouble starts too. Because, I'll be waiting for him with a squad of askaris. Nice if Julie's out by then. You see what I mean? - Yes, I do. Very clearly. - Splendid fellow. Ah-h-h. Jolly good gin, old boy. Jolly good. It's American. Really? It's not bad though. It's quite decent. Extraordinary. [gorillas hooting] [hooting continues] Oh, you found a pineapple. [hooting continues] Oh, Doris, what have you done? Oh, Doris, you're a nut. You gave all the ripe ones to your relatives. You're an idiot. You really are an idiot. - Hi. - Hi. Well, the place is a mess. Wish I'd known you were goin' to come. Yeah, this isn't exactly a social call. Well, how's she doing, huh? Come on, look up at me and see. You came all the way up here to check on Doris. Well, no. I, uh, came to take you back with me, Julie. Gregory is moving into the area. - Who? - Armand Gregory. What's he doing here? Well, he's got a bunch of armed mercenaries. Only this time, he's on a trapping expedition. Gorillas. 'All he can get and anyway he can get 'em.' Well, he's not gonna get my gorillas. Pack what you need and be out before the shooting starts. What shooting? Well, Carter is bringing some askaris to try to stop him. When he runs into Gregory it's bound to be a bit messy. A mess? What about my gorillas? They do have a sound instinct for self-preservation. Against guns? I know how you feel. There's nothing we can do. - So let Carter handle it. - Sorry you came all the way. Will you take her back with you? I'm staying. - You can't be serious? - I'm here to study gorillas. I care about them. They're my friends. Not about to go off and let them be trapped, maybe killed. Julie, it's your safety I'm worried about. - I'm worried about theirs. - What do you think you can do? I don't know. But it took me six months to get as close to them as I am. - You know how difficult it is. - Yes, I know-- No, you don't know. Now, at last, they trust me. They're allowing me to move among them. I can't leave them and I won't. - Now tell Carter-- - Tell Carter what? I'm not about to go off without you and that's that. Alright, if you want to stay, stay. Oh, now, Julie, don't be a bloody fool. There's nothing you can do. And there's nothing you can do about me. Goodbye. [storm clouds rumbling] [roll of thunder] Marsh, want some of this tent? No, thank you, I'm just fine. Why are you so stubborn? Give up. I'll give up just as soon as you agree to come back with me. Oh-h-h! Uh, Julie. What a hell of a time to have a fight. Julie. Julie. Julie, how about some coffee, huh? Come on, I give up. Go tell her I give up. Julie.. Julie? Julie? Julie? [gorilla hooting] [softly] Oh, boy. [Julie] 'Marsh, stay out in the open.' [Julie] Don't make a fast move. Now, let them see you. Show them you haven't anything in your hand. [gorilla hooting] [Julie] 'Slowly look to the left.' 'Very slowly.' [hooting continues] 'Alright, now move your head slowly to the right.' [gorillas hooting] 'Keep staring them in the eye.' [gorilla screeching] How long do I stare at him? [hooting continues] They'll break in a minute. [hooting continues] It's alright. They've gone. Marsh, why did you take such a risk? I had to get you out of here. Believe it or not, Carter's a pretty capable guy. - Oh, God. - Nothing you can do. - Got an idea. Will you help me? - Sure, if there's anything-- The river runs to the north of us and to the east, right? Yes. Which way is Gregory going to make his drive? From the south, get gorillas to water, which they won't cross. Given enough time, a gorilla will build a bridge, of sorts. Yes, but they won't have enough time. What's to stop us from building the bridge? Yeah, you're right. Come on, get your things. Hold it. Stay there. It's a Nagonzi trap. And it wasn't made by an African. As long as there are animals, they'll always be poachers. I hate them! It's an old one, isn't it? Uh, yeah. Does it look like good leopard country to you, Miss Paula? Yes, it does. He should run straight for cover. But just in case, Miss Paula, you better shut the door. Okay. [leopard snarling] [snarling continues] Okay, go on. Come on. Go on, move out. Go find your family, cat. Go on. Come on. Go on, move out. Don't you wanna go? You've been cooped up long enough. Take the wheel, Miss Paula. Drive it up a bit. Alright. Hold on. [engine revving] [leopard growling] [growling continues] Hold on, Juma. I'll pick you up. [leopard snarling] [leopard growls] [panting] You are your father's daughter, Miss Paula. Shall I drive or would you like to? Miss Paula, I like the way you drive. [engine revving] - Uh-h. - Ah. It's not as tough as all that. Is it, Marsh? Well, let's just say that...one of us is a little out of shape. - Well, that ought to do it. - Unless you think we need more. No. No, I-I don't. Better wash our, our scent off. [water splashing] At least as much as we can. [splashing continues] Well, I sure hope that works. - It's a little rough. - The rougher, the better. All they need is a way across the river out of the trap. It's fine. Well, that ought to fix monsieur Gregory's wagon. Oh, I hope so. [Gregory] 'On the contrary, I'd say you've been of great help.' I know who you are, Tracy. Who's she? None of your business. If you've ever heard of me, sweetheart you must know what a nasty fellow I can be at times. I'm making a study of gorillas for Dr. Tracy's Foundation. My name is Julie Harper. Another do-gooder? Your gorillas, my gorillas, they'll cross this? No weapons, huh? No weapons. It takes all kinds to make a world, doesn't it? Tiny, get two nets over the other side. We'll drive the gorillas over the bridges and straight into the nets. Don't know why I didn't think of that myself. It would have saved us a lot of trouble. You know how many gorillas there might be in this area? Roughly? Find out for yourself. It took me enough time. You seriously think I won't beat it out of you if I have to? - Better tell him. - About 40. What? About 40! Forty. We get half of them, we do alright. Okay, I want you out of my way. You better go back to my camp. Move! Wait! I don't want the gorillas disturbed until we're ready. You know how to move quietly? And remember. As far as I am concerned you are both expendable. So nice and quietly, huh? Don't use the bridge. Take them through the water. [water splashing] Siesta time, Clarence, come on. [chain clanking] Mr. Rowbotham is comin', Paula. He'll be here any minute. Oh, no. Put her in her basket. Husseini, will you? Please. Can't find her. She's gone. Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Come on, Mary Lou. Where are you? Oh, God. [Clarence growling] Oh-h, I know exactly where you are. Hand bag's much too good for you. I'll make you into a pair of shoes. I don't want to seem unkind. But...if you don't behave yourself one of these days I really will. Come on. Ugh-h. Mary Lou. Now you behave yourself. Come on. Come on. [dramatic music] [music continues] Clarence, don't you dare! There goes this week's lesson. Gone with the wind. Hey, that's a nice thought. [cage rattling] Test all the nets. Those gorillas are strong. Here, here and here. That's where we'll start the drive and we move north. Now, we begin in the late afternoon when the gorillas are resting. No, you can't. [vehicle speeding] You took your time getting here. We made a detour, picked us up a souvenir. We ran it down, took me more than an hour. [Julia] Marsh, no! Marsh! [birds chirping] Oh. Marsh. I told you, I can be a very nasty fellow. You can drink as much as you want when this is over. [glass breaks] You've opened his wound. No. Get me some bandages and sulfur. Sweetheart, I don't even carry iodine. And if I did. I would not waste it on him. There's a box of medical supplies in his Land Rover over at my camp. Now, go on and get it. Oh, what else? Everything I need. Go on! Tiny, I'm going over to their camp. We just found ourselves a nice Land Rover full of medical supplies. Have the boys ready by the time I get back. Oh, Marsh, I'm so sorry. I should've left when you told me to. No, no, no, that's okay. I just wanna be here when Gregory gets his. What about Carter? I don't know. I hope he gets here soon. Now, I know why I can't stand to see a trapped animal. I'm beginning to feel like one. Oh. [upbeat music] [music continues] [chain clanking] He's given up. We've outrun that cross-eyed calamity. [Doris screaming] [screaming continues] Get off. Get off. [gunshot] [Doris screaming loudly] [gunshot] [gunshots continue] [Doris screams] [gunshots continue] Alright. If that's the way you want it. Chimpanzees don't fetch a bad price, either. Stay there, huh? [engine revving] [gunshots continue] Get in here and stay down. Ah. Oh. Ow. Ow. Ah-h-h. - What are you doing here? - Same thing as you. [man screaming in pain] Ah. Ah-h. - Come on, let's get outta here. - Okay. Ah-h-h! [gun firing continues] Ah-h-h! [Carter speaking in Swahili] Sergeant? Well? Six wounded, sir. Seriously, I hope. Good show, Sergeant. Our team? No casualties, sir. Well, jolly good show. [Marsh] 'Carter, over here.' Well, jolly good show there, too. Tracy, old boy. Alright, let him go. This is Gregory's right hand man. Good. Put him with the others, Sergeant. Yes, sir. No! I'll take care of this one. Halt or I fire. [gun clicks] Uh, Sergeant, some ammunition, if you please? Carter, he's out of range. Now you've lost him. Well, I used to be pretty good myself at the hundred yard's dash. Stop! Ah. Knocked him cold, sir? Sir? Sir? Oh, sir. Well, don't just stand there, man. - Cut me down. - Yes, sir. Are you alright, sir? Thank you. Ah. [tribal music] [music continues] [Carter] 'Make 'em sit down.' [Larson speaking in Swahili] You know what he really needs is a few band-aids. That's a good idea. You think I should take off his pants? If that becomes necessary thank you, I'll doctor myself. [Marsh and Julie laugh] I'd have you know it's damnably painful. Oh, I'm sure it is. Now, hold on. You have one more. Brace yourself. - Oh. - Ow. I'm afraid you won't be able to sit down for a while. I'll have to do my drinking standing up, won't I? Sergeant, lete glassi wa maji. Listen, Carter. What are you gonna do about Gregory, huh? Oh, he'll probably get clear away again. He always does, you know. It's depressing. Wasn't that rather a negative attitude? Yes. Yes, it is, isn't it? Ah, care for a spot of mother's ruin, old boy? Oh, yes. Thank you. - Miss Harper? - No, thank you. English gin. Oh, um. Well, I suppose under the circumstances we can't afford to be fussy, can we? Cheers! [upbeat music] [music continues] [chain clanking] [music continues] Uh, ah. Ah-h-h! Uh, oh, help me! Help. Oh-h-h. Oh-h. Ah-h. [Doris chatters] Oh-h. Help me! Ah-h. Oh-h. Ah-h. [coughing] [Sergeant] 'Forward March.' 'Oh. Uh. Help me!' Ah-h-h! That's Gregory. Ah-h. Get a hold of the net. Give me a hand with the net. [Doris screeches] Yeah! Ah-h. Ah. [Gregory screaming] - Sergeant, stop them. - Yes, sir. Stop! [blows the whistle] 'Oh! Help me!' [whistling continues] 'Help!' 'Oh-h. Oh-h.' 'Help!' Ah-h-h. Ah-ha. Scruffy looking fellow, aren't you? Hm? Hm? [Doris chatters] Take the wheel. Quick. Hurry. [Doris chattering] Go on, get in there. Last time you'll monkey around the gorillas in my territory. "Monkey around with gorillas." That's rather funny, isn't it? - No. Not really. - Hmm. And I saw my first lions yesterday, mother. At a distance. They're very hard to approach. But hold on, one just drove through my tent in a jeep. It was a Land Rover, honey. Oh, was it? Oh, alright. Land Rover. Dammit, we've lost them. Well, we're bound to run out of gas soon. We'll just follow the tracks. Come on, change places. [engine revving] What a stroke of good fortune, help me out. Um, pardon me. I wonder if you would be kind enough I mean, could you, uh, possibly.. [Doris chatters] Oh, my goodness. You stay where you are. Don't you come near me. [chattering continues] Hm, Oh, oh, oh. Now I lay me down to sleep. [Doris chatters loudly] Oh. Oh, no. Go away. Please. Do go away. Oh, oh. I want my mother. Oh. I've lived a good life. [Marsh] Well, I'm glad to see that you two finally made friends. Here, come on, old boy. Now, come on, Rupert. Now, old boy, we'll give you a bit of a hand here. There. There. Come on, we'll take you back. - Marsh! - Rup! [dramatic music] Julie, you remember up in Ulenzi when you offered me a share of your tent? I remember. Was that only because of the rain? No. Well, if I offered you a share of, uh, all this? I think I'd come in out of the rain. [lion growling] Check and I venture to suggest quite possibly mate. [Rupert laughing] Now that daddy's fixed your eyes you can stay with us forever. Isn't it more comfy in here than out there in the bush with no one to play with? I wouldn't be too sure of that, Miss Paula. Oh. We just found them out in the bush, Miss Paula. Look! [cubs squeaking] Uh, Clarence? This is absolutely the end.
