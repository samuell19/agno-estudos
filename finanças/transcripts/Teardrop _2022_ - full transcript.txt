- No, no! - Oh, my god. Little girl? Little girl, are you okay? Are you okay? No. No! No! No! No! No! - All right, we made the left at the fork, so Lily Road should be coming up any second. - I can't find it. - It's because it's not gonna be on that phone. You gotta look up. Gotta eyeball it. - How'd I agree to this again? - 'Cause the Young Writers Club needed you. Seriously, if you hadn't signed up for this field trip, we wouldn't be here. Thank you. - Well, my soul would've preferred a trip to Steinbeck's home. - Uh-huh. Too far. You look like a superhero with those glasses on. Like a female Clark Kent. - Wow, thanks. - I meant that as a compliment. - It didn't sound that way. - Okay, how about this? You look smart and drop dead gorgeous. How's that? - That's inappropriate. - Wow. Can't win with you, can I? - We work together. As in, I have to see you every day in the teacher's lounge until I get my tenure. - I know. I heard. - Ooh! Lily Road. - How we doing back there, guys? - Nauseous. - Okay. Try looking out the window. Watch the road. - Are you gonna blow chunks? Hey, yo, yo, yo, Teach. Stop the van. We got a spewer in the backseat. Oh! Oh. Thar she blows. - Go outside and see if she painted the van. - I will, I will. Side of the boat is all clean, Captain. Nice aim, Teala. - Sorry. - You okay, Teala? - Yeah, just need a minute. - Okay. - Best book ever. You have such a way with words. It's like I'm inside them, feeling every pain, every joy. - You liked it. - Mm-hm. I loved it. I can't wait to read the others. - Well, it's my only one, so... I appreciate it, Josie. Thank you. - Well, you really are an incredible writer, Chris. - Mr. Cotton. - They can call me Chris. Mr. C. How about Mr. C? - Eh. - All right, I'm good. - Yes? - All right. - All right, let's do it. Okay. - Yup! - All right. - Give me that. - What's that? - Don't touch it. - Okay. - Yeah, yeah, like, we don't need to see it again... - So this is Teardrop. Wow. - Oh, it was booming back in its day. Teardrop was a gold rush town. Think the mines are supposed to be in those hills right there. But when there's something of great value, trouble always follows. So the miners would chain dogs up to the mouth of the mine to keep the thieves out. But when the gold was gone, the miners were gone. Those sick bastards would leave the dogs tied up to die. Hell dogs are supposed to haunt this town now. They said, at night, you can hear them howling in pain. No one's actually ever seen them, though. And that is the story of the great Teardrop. Come on. Come on. We're checking in right here. Afternoon. We are looking to check in. Do you have any rooms available? - We might. - I would've called in advance, but I couldn't find your number anywhere. - We like to operate by word of mouth. Keeps his place from becoming a tourist trap. Pardon my stare. I could've sworn you've checked in before. - No. No. No. Never. - Must be deja vu, then. - Denver, is it? - Like the capital of Colorado. - Are you the owner of the hotel? - I wear all the hats so to speak. That your family? - No. My students. They're on their senior field trip. Young Authors Club. - Hm. - It's their last year, so I wanted to take them somewhere unforgettable. - Our town's so forgettable, most don't know we exist. - That's exactly why we're here. So I'll need five rooms, if that's okay. - One is what I've got. - Are you kidding? - Well, we are almost at full capacity. That an issue? - It just seems quiet. - Well, we have some old timers who like to tuck in early. I don't keep tabs on my guests, but I do keep a tab. Care for a drink? - No. - You sure? - Yes. It's early. Thank you. I'm sure. - I do have the old judge's cabin available. Gonna cost you extra, though. - Judge? - Called him the Hanging Judge. - The Hanging Judge? - That's right. - They have one room and a cabin available. - Oh, well, that's perfect. - What? - So it'll be the three of us in the cabin. And then you guys can take the room. - Yeah, that's a great idea. Let's do that. - No. The obvious choice is me and Chris in the hotel. - Chris and I. AP English exam next week. And I thought we agreed on Mr. C? - Um, I didn't agree to anything, Ms. H. - A cabin and a room is fine. I'll take the girls. You take Ross. Nice to meet you. I'm Rebecca. - I've been cleaning up things in the back, ma'am. Don't wanna make your hands all filthy now. Room 2 in the hotel, end of the road. Cabin about 50 yards from there, past the church. - Thank you, Denver. - You are the very welcome. Excuse me, mister. - Sorry. The bill. So I'm assuming that this is a cash-only kinda place. - Teardrop's really more of a pit stop. Come through, take a glance out the window, and keep on moving. I recommend you do the same. - It's not my first rodeo. - You sure we haven't met before? - Oh, I'm sure. - Hm? - I'd remember someone like you. How much? - How much do you got? - Right. You can just say when. - That'll do. - Okay. - Enjoy your stay now. - All right. All right, all right. The cabin and the hotel are down this way. So let's go grab our bags. - No way. - This is me and Ross. - Oh, this is us? Oh, swim move. Ooh. Hey, I got dips on this bad boy right here. - Chris, come get in my selfie. - We don't allow photos. - Sorry. Kids and their smartphones. You know how they are. - Don't do it again. - We won't. Sorry. - Is he serious? - Real nice guy. - Mm-hm. - Let's go. - No. I'm good here. Unless Josie wants to... - Okay. - No, I'm good. Wouldn't want you touching my luggage anyways. - Made a friend, huh? - Mm-hm. ♪ My name is Ross ♪ I am the boss ♪ Just took a loss ♪ Still got the sauce - Woo. Yo, I gotta write that down. - You okay? - Yeah. - What? - Any luck? - No Teardrop 5G. - A nice break from technology never hurt anyone. - Not when you're waiting for college acceptances. - You've already gotten into, like, a dozen schools. - Not my first choice. - Be grateful you got in. - Yeah. - I wonder if they have hot water here. - Ahem! - Oh. - What? Never seen a pair of double Ds before? - Behind the curtain, please. - Boob job at 17, you believe that? Actually, I kinda do. - You guys talking about me? - Oh, no, no, no. - No. - Nothing. Yeah. - This place is wild, isn't it? Bet this hotel hasn't changed in over a hundred years. Wonder what brought the town down. Bet it was smallpox. Smallpox, you know... You're an entitled little prick, you know that? - Were you talking to me? - Yeah, I was. - Huh. - I said this town, it's crazy, isn't it? It's like a portal back in time. - That's crazy. You know, no offense, Mr. C... Hey, check this out. ♪ The Old West is a snoozefest ♪ I just wanna get some rest ♪ No more pests I... Oh, sweet Jesus. Did you see that maid?

Yo, excuse me. - Didn't mean to bother you. - Oh, no, no, no. You didn't. I just, or, well, my teacher and I, we're writing a book about the town. We just wanna ask you a few questions. We're interested, you know? - I'd love to hear about the town of Teardrop from a local. - I'm not supposed to talk to customers. - Okay. Well, what are you supposed to do, then? - Clean, quiet as a mouse. - Well, yeah. She's a maid, Mr. C. That's what she... She cleans, you know. I'm Ross the Boss. Or, well, you can just call me Ross. I mean, Ross the Boss is like my nickname, my alias, you know, my rap name. It's nice to meet you. - I'm sorry. I'm not allowed. - You're not allowed to shake... Damn. What did I do wrong there? Don't laugh, Mr. C. Don't act like you have... - Yes, yes! - That sounded like hurt. - No, no, no. That doesn't hurt. That's great positioning. That's what that is. - Ew. - This is pretty ridiculous. - You know what position that is, Josie? - Ew, shut up. - That's cowgirl. - That's inappropriate. - That's just the place we're in right now. - Shh. - Well, there are definitely guests here. - I haven't seen anyone. - I can hear them, like, you know. - No... I don't know what that is. - From your room. The kids are having a listening party at the moment. - You heard them? - Yeah. - Something to drink, ma'am? - No thank you. - Hm. - Like you should be. Us being the adults and all. - I had a little bit of a headache. I just think one will help take the edge off. - A headache, huh? - Yeah. Headache. Denver here was about to tell us about why the town was named Teardrop. - You ask a lot of questions. - It's 'cause he's a novelist. - Is he now? - Mm-hm. Published bestseller. And he still graces us as a teacher. - Hm. - What can I say? I love to teach. - What are your books about? - American frontier ghost towns. And it's "book," singular. - He's being modest. He's writing a new one right now. - Well... To answer your question, the town was named after a little girl. A quiet child who loved her dolls made of straw. Lorelei. Lorelei was a strange one, kept to herself and her toys, but she became a pariah around town. Kids pinched her, called her a freak, anything to get a rise out of her. But little Lorelei wouldn't react. Kids being kids, they took it too far. They started pelting her with stones until she was bruised and bloodied. And still, the girl would not cry. Legend has it, Lorelei never shed a single tear no matter what anyone did. Nowadays, we'd know she had a disorder, a genetic inability to cry. - Well, that's some way to name a town. - You asked. - You know, I think I will have a drink. - Yes, ma'am. - What? We're allowed to have some fun, right? - Look what I brought. - Are those brownies? - Mm-hm, edibles. - Nice. - Who's down to get baked? Josie? You're down. Teala? Down to get baked? - Oh, sorry. Can't. Studying. - Teala, have you ever even gotten stoned? - Um, no. - No? Oh, we are so popping your weed cherry tonight. - No. No one is popping my weed cherry. Or any cherry for that matter. - Oh, come on. We'll guide you through it. We'll be like your green Sherpas. - Yeah, and these are edibles, so they don't hurt your lungs. I mean, it's weed. So you'll lose a couple of brain cells, big deal. You have enough for all three of us combined. - True. - Ah, I don't know about that. - All right, here. Teala. Ooh! - Oh. - You caught it. Josie. Ooh. That's the best one. - Mm. - Am I gonna freak out over this? - No, you'll get high. - Am I gonna hallucinate and shit? - Come on. It'll be fun. I promise. - Is that Nutella? - Yeah, and cannabutter. Whole jar of it right here. All right, ready? Let's all take it. Three, two- - One bite, okay? One bite, that's it. - Okay, and then after that first bite, you'll eat the whole thing so you can get high. One. - Okay. - Mm. - Mm. - Nice job. These are amazing. - Mm-hm. Thank you. That's not the only thing I do well, Josie. - That portrait in the hotel entrance, that's her, right? Lorelei? - Mm-hm. - What's her mother's name? - Alice. - Alice. - I think we've had enough story time for one night. - Maybe I'm a little tipsy, but I think he's kinda growing on me. What? - You're a little tipsy. Don't you like him? I like him. - Josie, what are you doing? - Taking a selfie, duh. - Yeah, she's taking a selfie, duh. Let me get in there. - Guys, we're not supposed to take pictures. - Teala, get in here. - Gonna get in trouble. - Come on. Oh, what the hell? - What? - How do we look like that? - Either your phone is messed up or these edibles are kicking in quick. - What's going on? - Some drama, that's what's going on. Here. Be quiet. Let's keep exploring. - Uh, I don't know about that. - Oh, god! - Oh! - Wait, wait. Josie, give me your phone. - Um. - Just give me your phone. Josie. Whoa, jeez! - Oh! - What the F?! - God. They're scarecrows. - What? - Just alone, in the bed. Who does that? - It's freezing in here. - Yeah. And this vase must've blown off the dresser from the wind. - Yeah, those windows aren't open. Anyways, it still doesn't explain the voices. Guys, can we get the hell outta here? - Yeah, I don't like this. - Yeah, I mean... - Let's go, Ross. - There's no more to see. - I just can't get enough of this place. I can't. I wanna just drink it all in. Since we've been here, I feel like I tapped into a creative reservoir inside of me. - What about your new book? Hello? - It was rejected. - What do you mean? - My publisher hated it. Hated it. She said it was uninspired. Actually, what she said was that I phoned it in. So, yeah, I'm starting over. - When did this happen? - Earlier this year. - Why didn't you tell me? - Because it's humiliating. It's deflating. I've still been trying to process it for myself, I think. But since we've been here, for the first time in a long, long time, I feel like I have pages in me. Great pages. I wanna take a totally different direction. I don't wanna write any more bland, dry stories about Western ghost towns. I wanna make it personal. - I'm sorry they didn't like it. Fuck them. - Yeah. Yeah. Fuck them. Yes! - Yeah. - Fuck them. - Fuck them. - Fuck 'em. Fuck them. - Oh. You're drunk. - Not really. - Look, if this is gonna happen, I just wanna take it really slow. Okay? - We should go check on the kids. - Do you guys think it's true- - What? - About Chris and Marie Pannenbaker? - No. - No, that's not true. - I wish it were true. Means I might actually have a shot. - Well, why don't you just date to guy your own age? It might actually work out for once. - Guys in high school aren't mature enough for me. - Really, no one in high school's mature enough for you? - Maybe at Hamilton. - I knew I should've gone to Hamilton. You know what? I'm high as shit. We are in the middle of nowhere. Let's just go back. - What? Dude, don't be a buzzkill. - Who are you right now? - I don't know, but I'm feeling kinda groovy. - Yeah, girl. - What, you say "groovy"? - Yeah. - Teala, no, no, no, no. Okay, now I'm sticking around. We don't say "groovy" anymore. - Well, we're saying it now. - Let me teach you what we do say, okay? - What? - We say "lit." - Oh. - All right? - Lit. Lit, there we go. - Lit. - Hey, guys, look at this. - Is that singing? - Sounds like it. - What did you put in these edibles? - Couple of grams of indica. And some THC powder. I mean, they're strong, but that's it. - Guys, I'm either tripping really hard, or that sound is coming from inside that barn. - Oh, hell to the no. - Oh, hell to the yes. I'm going in. Who's with me? - Me. - What? Guys. - Singing stopped. - Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. - What's that? - What the F?! - Shh, shh, shh. - Holy shit! Run, run! - Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's going on?! - Mr. C... Okay. - I'm just so glad you're here. I was so freaked out. - Okay, that's, all right... There's something fucked up in there, man. - Like what? - Fucked up! Mr. C, the eyes... - Mr. C, swear to God, there's something in there. - Oh, shit. - Chris?! - They got him. I say we go. - Chris! - There's nothing. Bunch of barn mice. - What? - Yeah, some barn mice from hell. - No way. - Have you been drinking? - No. - No, no, no. - Mm-hm. Breath check. Ross. - No, no, no, no, listen, Ms. Harris, I haven't brushed my teeth since we got here, so for your own safety, keep your distance. You guys heard the singing, right? - Singing? Why are your eyes red? - I was in there and I had a near death experience, Mr. C. - We're high as shit! - Fuck! - Mm-hm. - They peer pressured me to doing it. - Wow, some team player you are. - I worked way too hard to throw everything away, all right? I'm literally going to be disowned by my parents. Please. This can't go on my record. I have to get into Penn. - 'Cause she wouldn't have taken an edible if I didn't force her. Punish me. I'm not going to college anyways, so nothing to lose. - What? No, no, no. Look, it was my weed. That shit was way too dank. It's on me, okay? Josie, I got this. - Okay, okay. You guys, I don't care whose idea it was. It's not okay. What should we do? - Give a warning. - A warning? - What do you want do? Yes, a warning. Yes, a big fucking warning for each of you. Let's go! - Thank you so much. - Let's go! - Ms... - No. Turn and walk. I don't even wanna hear it. Chris, you're running a jungle. Walk. Please. - There's... Please! - We survived the night. Generally, a good sign when you're staying in a ghost town. The kids reported a couple of anomalies, but I'm not sold on it. When haven't you been to a ghost town that didn't try to pull a fast one? I know there's more to you, Teardrop. I just don't know where to look. - Wow. What time is it? - Good morning, pumpkin. - What's up, Mr. C? - You ready? - Ready for what? - We're touring the town. We're waiting on you. Let's go. - Wait. Mr. C, someone took my pains. I need- - There's the general store, courthouse, livery stable. Got the old mine shaft about a quarter mile off. All inoperable. - What's still open? - The saloon, the hotel. That's what everyone wants. A drink and a warm bed. - What about the cabin that the girls are staying in? What's up with that? - That belonged to the old judge of teardrop. Judge Wincott. Or the Hanging Judge, as they liked to call him. See the guy gallows over there? That's where one of the most horrific hangings took place long ago. She was his wife. She told him he would pay for what he did, they all would. And "no one would ever leave this place." - That's it?! You're gonna leave us on a cliffhanger? - Your stay's not over yet. - Why'd he hang her, Denver? - Hey, Mr. C, that guy's a weirdo. - Be respectful. - I agree, he's so weird. - That guy is such a weirdo. - I don't... - Mm. Chris? I hear you. Don't say a word. This is what you wanted all along, right? Well, that's all you get for now, you dirty perv. Chris? - Yo, you need help? - No. - Okay. - Sorry. I forget who I'm supposed to be sometimes. - Ah, anxiety. Yeah, I suffer from it too. I even wrote something about it. ♪ Yo, check it ♪ I suffer from anxiety ♪ Bottled up inside of me ♪ Like a knife in the side of me ♪ ♪ Writing rhymes in my diary ♪ Just for the notoriety ♪ Yeah - You're very funny. - Thank you. I try. I try really hard, actually. - Hey, I get it. People often think I'm two-faced. - I don't think you're two-faced. I mean, I act like a douchebag because, I don't know, I think it makes me look cool. - What's a douchebag. - Oh, no shot. You don't know what a douchebag is? What... No way. Whoa. Where are you from? - I never left here. - You have never left here? - Can't. Not allowed. - Get inside! - Coming! - Whoa. Hey, he should not be talking to you like that. - He thinks he's my dad or something. - Hey. Denver, that's what a douchebag is. - Now! - Come to the cemetery tonight. - The cemetery? Tonight? You're totally a weirdo. Okay. ♪ Got a date at the cemetery ♪ Hope it won't be scary - I heard dogs. - Probably some wild dogs somewhere. Preserve the devil. - The hell hounds you told us about? - I don't know. - Okay, Chris, let's call it. Let's get the hell outta Dodge. - Not going anywhere. - I don't like it here. I wanna go home. You can come back on your own and write your book. Without us. - It's not just about my book. - What are you talking about? - Found this in my grandfather's basement. That letter was written in this hotel. More than a century ago. - I don't understand. - Becca, I've been looking for this place for years. Years. It's not online anywhere. It's not in maps. It's not in books. Okay? Nowhere. - You're not making any sense. - Read the letter. Read the letter. - Jeez Louise. Okay. "My dearest son, I am sending you away from this wicked place. Promise me you will never come back here. Your loving mother, Alice." - Alice. Alice. Rebecca, I think that Alice is my great-grandmother. Alice that's on the portrait in the hallway. Alice that was... Who was hung to death. - Yes. Yes. She gave up her son to get him away from this place. That baby was my grandfather. She wrote this letter to give him when he was old enough. I think that Alice got my grandfather out of here before she cursed this town. - My god, you don't really believe in curses? - I'll tell you what I do know, is that the town of Teardrop began to wither away pretty quickly after that, along with its history and everyone in it. - You shouldn't have brought the students here. - I know that. - Do you understand how this looks? - Yes. Abso-fucking-lutely insane. - Why are you putting me in this position? - Because this is my family, Rebecca. This is my past. This is my history. Rebecca, I can't leave here yet. Please. Please, you have to understand. I can't go. Not yet. - I wish you would've told me. - I should have... Stop. Enough. - Rebecca, please. - Okay. We stay, but it's for you. - Thank you. - Where's Teala? - I don't know. She wanted to study outside. - I told you not to split up. Have you seen Teala? - No. I'll go look for her. - What? - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, are you all right? What happened? - I don't know, I just... - Okay, okay. Listen. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. You're okay. You're okay. Listen to me. We're going back. We're gonna stay in groups of at least two from now on. Okay? Let's go back. You're okay. You're okay. It's just a rough idea right now, okay? I'm probably gonna rewrite this a dozen times, but it would- - It's fantastic. - Is it? - It is. - God. Thank you for reading that. - Thanks for letting me. - Your usual? - It's 3:45 p.m. - Yeah, Denver. Gonna hold off for a while. - Whatever you say. - But while you're here... - Mm-hm? - Why don't you tell us why you hung her? - You have a fetish for this ghost story stuff, don't you? - You gonna make me ask again? - Don't get angry on me. - I'm not. - The last thing I ever want to do is get you upset. - I'm not angry. - All right. I'll tell you. Just don't quote me in your book or anything. I prefer to be left anonymous. The Hanging Judge didn't have a trace of empathy. Merciless. But it wasn't just the sinners who feared his wrath. It was his own flesh and blood too. By the time Lorelei was eight, he had grown to hate her. Plagued him like a disease. So disgusted by what he created, he could only do the one thing he knew how. Screamed, "Cry! Why won't you cry?!" No matter how hard he ever beat her, she wouldn't do it, or couldn't do it. He murdered his daughter that night. They say the judge had no sorrow, not even a single tear. Of course, no one dared question the word of the Hanging Judge. Poor Alice took the blame. Her cries could be heard across Teardrop. No worse sound than a mother losing her child. - What about the baby? - "What about the baby?" - The baby, did he make it out alive? - You're living proof, my friend. - What do you mean? - I knew the moment you stepped foot in my bar. You look just like him. It's remarkable. - How do you know what the Hanging Judge looks like? - Photos were left behind. I reckon Chris could show you some of the old newspapers he's been finding. - Ugh, what a trip this has turned out to be. I'm gonna be so heated if next year's class gets to go to, like, Hawaii or something. - You're just mad Mr. C won't get with you. - Hey, I may have lost the battle, but not the war. - Okay. You're kinda like the female General Custard. - Who's that? - Do you, like, not pay any attention in class at all? - Hey, school isn't as important as real life experience. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - Oh. It's fine. Happened a long time ago. - I've been told I'm a great listener. Amongst other things. - I've been having some weird thoughts since we got here. - Like suicidal thoughts? - Sorta. I know them really well, so it's scary. - Well, you know what I think? I think you put too much pressure on yourself. I mean, you're never gonna look back and care about your GPA. 3.8, 3.9, what's the difference? - Weighted 4.0. - Okay. Well, live a little. I mean, be dumb and stupid for a change. All those bad thoughts will go away. Promise. - Look what I found. Who's down to get old school drunk? - Never have I ever dated a college boy. - College boys, no. But college girls, several. - Several. - Several. - Drink up, then. - All right. - Okay, my turn. Never have I ever tried to kill myself. - The hell? Josie. - What? It's true. I haven't. - No, that's not cool. I don't care. - I'm not ashamed of it. - Yeah. See, Ross, she doesn't care. - Okay. Then I got one. Never have I ever been a ho. Drink up, skank. - Fuck you, asshole! - Fuck you. You're a DNA dumpster, and that's all you're good for. - What, because I won't blow you? - No... All right, screw you. And you know what? Screw you too. I stood up for you. Get outta my way. - No. - All right, you bitch. I got a date with the maid, so I'll see ya. - What a dick. God. - Well, was fun while it lasted. - Oh, shut up. - Winifred Carmine. 1802. Would've never predicted this, would you, Winifred? - Careful where you step. Gone doesn't mean they're gone away. - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. - Don't apologize to me. - Winifred, I apologize. Do you want, are you old enough to drink? - On some days. - Okay. Well, how about this one? - Nope. - Yeah, that's probably a pretty good idea. I really shouldn't be drinking this either. I mean, this was my dad's poison. He's a dry fucking drunk now, so... It's just so exhausting being young, you know? Like, sometimes, I wish I could just push a button and bang. I'm married and have a kid and I just have my shit together. - Being old isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Your body starts to rot, desiccate, and smell funny. - Oh, gosh. You are unlike anyone I have ever met before. - I can be someone else if you'd like. - No. No, no, no. Just be yourself. That's what I'm into. - How do I do that? - Now, that is a damn good question. I don't even know sometimes. I mean... You know, you were right. This is peaceful. - Wait until the sun sets. - Mm. I'll be waiting on bated breath. - A fading sun is the one pure thing in this world. It's the last thing you see on the hanging tree. - On the hanging, what? - I'm not good at this. - No, it's all right. I'm not good at a lot of... Hey, where are you going? - Catch me! - Catch you? Okay. I'm really fast, actually. Where'd you go?! Hey. Excuse me? Have you seen a maid? Holy shit! Oh, fuck. Where's the maid? - Is that Ross? Oh, my god. - Hey, hey! You all right? Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Okay. - Not that great, all right. Whoa, whoa, watch your chain. - Take it slow. - Watch your chain. - Wait, my chain. Can you get my chain? - No, I'm not gonna touch that. Get up. Get up. You good? - Yeah. - What have you been doing? - I'm good. Just too much sauce for Ross the Boss. - Too much sauce? - Yeah, I don't think any of that is funny, Ross. - Where have you two been? - Stop it. - Making sure your friend doesn't have alcohol poisoning. - Yeah, I'm sorry, Josie. I didn't mean what I said earlier. - You smell like a frat party. - Guys, what in the hell is going on here? I was 18 once. I get it, all right? But with the drinking, with the weed? What do I need to do here? Huh? Do I need to be the bad teacher? Calls you guys in? Gets you suspended? - It's just some- - I don't wanna hear it right now. Do you have anything to add, Ms. Harris? - We leave bright and early tomorrow. Set your alarms for 6:00 a.m. - Wait. I thought we were in leaving Sunday morning? - Executive decision. - Been having these migraines since I've been here. In Teardrop. I feel this rage. It's coming over me, thinking about our time together. It's almost over. I can't leave yet. I feel like if I do, I'm not gonna get to come back. And I still have so many questions. - Um, okay, how about C? - There is a C. Hey, I told you there's a C. - There's a C? - Yeah. - Okay. - Chris? - No. - Mr. C. - Chris! - No. Wait! Rebecca! Rebecca. Rebecca... Get off of me! - I didn't do anything. I didn't touch her, I swear. - I don't believe you, Chris! I don't believe a single word out of your mouth! - I saw her. I saw Lorelei. - You are fucking unbelievable! And it's a shame too because I was just starting to like you. - I saw her! I fucking saw her in the bathtub inside! - I knew what you were, I should've trusted my gut. I'm such a sucker. - You knew what I was? I wouldn't make this up. - You're a writer, it's what you fucking do! It's over. - Where are you going?! - Far away from you! - Ms. Harris. What's going on? - Ask Chris. Is there any way you could drive me to the nearest town? - As far as I can take you. - Thank you. Beautiful car. - A nice old gentleman left it years back. Still hasn't returned for it. I figure he'll thank me for keeping the engine warm. - What is it? - Can't go any further than this. - Oh. I'll pay you. - Not about money. - What is it about, then? - I feel uncomfortable leaving the hotel. I'm sure you can relate. - I can't. - This is the best I can do for you. - Seriously? I could've walked this far. - Truly and deeply sorry. - Thanks. - Nothing even happened between us. You caught a look, big deal. - So, Mr. C accidentally walks in on you, so has the entire graduating class. - Watch it. It's not funny. - It's just a brush. - Mr. C. - Chris. You can call me Chris. - Are you seeing things too? - No. I think we all need to get some shuteye. Moving back to my room. You guys stay outta trouble. - Hey, Mr. C, I was thinking that I would just stay here with the girls so you can be alone. - Sure. Why the hell not? - Okay. - Ross! Teala's gone! - Oh, shit. Hey! Teala! - Pack your shit. We're getting outta here. Now. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Ross. - Hey. We're getting the fuck outta here. You should come. - Follow me. - Hey! What are you doing?! Wait! - Does this phone work? Hello? Hello? Hello?! Fuck! - Who are you trying to call? - The police. - Now, why would you do that? - 'Cause there's a fucking dead girl outside. - This is Denver speaking. Mm-hm. Mm, he's right here. Yes, it is crazy how much like him he looks. All right. She wants to talk to you. - Who is that? Hello? - It was nice to see your face. You have turned into a handsome man. Just like your grandfather. - Who is this? - You know who this is, my darling. - What the fuck's happening here? - Same thing that happens every time. The faces are new, but it always ends the same. - Josie? Josie, we've gotta go. Listen, I know you feel guilty, all right? But... - Wait! Come with us! Hey! Wait! Hey, just hold on. Hold on. Hey. Just, please, just listen to me. - Lower your lantern. - What... No, I'm not gonna lower the lantern. - Pretty please? You'll go wild for this. Everyone does. No cheating. - What's that voice? - Lift your lantern. I can be someone else instead. Whoever you want. All of us were hung at the neck, it's the worst way to go. With everyone watching, with everyone laughing as you squirm. They're all me. And I'm them. - Stop, you fucking freak! - I was a freak. You're gonna wish you got the rope. - No, no! Oh, god, no! - You're dead. You've been dead for a hundred years. - Ross?! Ross! Rebecca?! - I will not be the scapegoat for what you've done. - What I have done? - You have killed, Judge. - What did you do to me?! - I myself have not done a thing. I told you to leave while you still could. Your usual, sir? - No. No! - Chris! What time is it? - You! You did it to us! - I need to know the time, Chris, 'cause I don't make it a hair pass 10. - Hey! ♪ I went out one morning for to take a little walk ♪ ♪ Came upon that Wild Bill Jones ♪ ♪ He was walking and a-talking by my little girl's side ♪ ♪ I bid him for to leave her alone ♪ ♪ He said, young man, I'ma past 21 ♪ ♪ Too old to seek control ♪ Well, he whipped out his blade, so then I drew my gun ♪ ♪ Destroyed that poor boy's soul ♪ ♪ He jerked and he scrambled and fell down on the ground ♪ ♪ And gave one dying moan ♪ I threw my arms around my little girl's neck ♪ ♪ I said, honey, now you're all alone ♪ ♪ Now, let's pass around them long-necked bottles ♪ ♪ Let's all go out on a spree ♪ Today was last of the Wild Bill Jones ♪ ♪ Will tomorrow be the last of me ♪ ♪ Fill your glasses up to the brim ♪ ♪ And let the drink flow free ♪ Today was the last of the Wild Bill Jones ♪ ♪ Will tomorrow be the last of me ♪ ♪ I got out out of jail without any bail ♪ ♪ But the judge said I was a free man ♪ ♪ I looked all around till my little girl I found ♪ ♪ Said I couldn't see her again ♪ ♪ Yes, I took a life of that Wild Bill Jones ♪ ♪ But it still took my true love from me ♪ ♪ I've been overtaken by a worried mind ♪ ♪ Will this trouble never set me free ♪
