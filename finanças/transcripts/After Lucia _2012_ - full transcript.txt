AFTER LUCIA That is what happened with the car? I sold it to you. Here is your pajamas and your toothbrush. Thank you. Do you want some? No thank you. You're sure? It is up to the almonds. It is very nice. Actually. One goes there? Mmmmh. I have the time to take a bath? Yes. Hi! Sorry but this is my place. -Pardon. -No, not to worry. You have travelled by car or by plane? In the car. In how many hours? More or less 10 hours. You're not tired? A little, but that's okay. Your father seems to be a good person. We get on very well. What subjects have you got today? History, English, and biology. What did you think? Well, it is almost the same thing that I saw before. Well, if you need anything, you call me unto you. Thank you. Ready? No, I just do it. So... What a horror these tests, anti-drug to all students. What are the rules of the school. It is the same for all students. I called José. You take advantage of? This is super! You come to Puerto Vallarta, isn't it? -Yes. -Completely different... We go to "The Contessa"? -No chance. -No, you feel like it. I'm going to either to one or the other. I think that you know Camila. -Hi. -How are you? -Irene. - "Big" and Manual. -Hi. -Javier... Hi, Javier. She has already given one. Take a different one. Who is going to eat all that? You go out to eat on the road up to the house of Jose. -And then, anyway... -where do you come From? I come from Puerto Vallarta. Wow, it must be nice down there! -Yes. That is what you are doing? Well, you know... surfing... -Go to school, hang out with friends. -Surfing... What? -Of course, silly. -Surf... Standing on the board... to Take the wave... -It rises and goes down... -Yes. And the reason why you are coming to the capital city? Because of my father's work. -What is it made of? He is head chef. Awesome, is it not the big! He came to open a restaurant? Yes. Where? I was not there yet, but I think it is... - ...The Contessa. I see...Yes... What kind of food it serves? Of all, but crustaceans and fish, mostly. -A real treat. -It is the same. -One sees you there? -Hmm. And you live where? Has Anzures, Polanco. -I live near there. -Really? -It is true. Awesome. -What is the joke? He does not know where it is and it says he lives in Polanco! It's disgusting... disgusting... It makes him want to throw up when he does that. I had a beach restaurant and the fish was from Canada or Asia. Because the domestic products are much too expensive. Perfect, we will stop with them. I wanted to show you that. It is good, but I tend to think it's the second washed-out. Then, you prefer something more clear... A grey, for example? -Yes, let's see... Something more informal. "Very good. -Pardon me... Excuse me. Hello, my love. How are you? Yes, I am trying to work a little. As you want to. There you go, a rock group. I'm going to this side, close to the glass. I'll call you when we arrive. Or I send a rocket. Ok. Ok. Thank you. I love you. It is good. It is sweet, the big. -Sweet. -I don't want to, asshole. And how is school for you? Well, I think that it is good. José told me that you had been called for the drug testing. -Yes. -You are concerned about? I am. We would have been able to tell you how to change the cup. It is true. I'm fucking. But what is this... what is it that you took? I have smoked marijuana a week ago. Don't worry. They are not going to say to the parents. They only offer a rehabilitation programme. But your father is very "concerned"? No. My father is very quiet. And your mother? My mother is in Puerto Vallarta. But your father will tell him. I don't think. But if he learns it, it will not be the brothel? Same, I don't think. Then it's ok. In fact. I was trying to find a swimming pool. I think I have found one in the south. I have yet to address. As soon as I've, we are going. Of course. We need to buy things at the supermarket. For tomorrow and the rest of the week. Yes. There has never been a neighbors, at home... To Puerto. Or even better, we are going to buy here? That is what it is? I don't know. Try again. That is what it is? I can't say. If you do not know what it is, how will you prepare them? -Hello. -Hello. I thank you for being here. -No problem. I'm going to be direct. The school has put in place periodic checks on drugs for students We spend a to Alejandra and her test is positive for marijuana. I do not understand what the school has to do with it. You know that she uses marijuana? -Not. The school recommends a program of rehabilitation. Of course, we can't force it. If it is again positive, we will have to expel him. How long have you smoke? I've been trying for about three months. With who? With friends to Puerto. That? Manolo, and Julia. And you have a lot smoked? Not just a few times. -Is this true? -Yes. I promise you that I will stop smoking. Really, I'm fine. Yes... Yes, the hospital, I guess. No, the undertaker will not have to pay. I think it does not reimburse. Leticia, it is a thing. Ok, I see. Listening... In the evening? Alejandra is very happy. Sorry Leticia. I went back to the kitchen. Then, I name you. Bye. One... Two... Three...! You don't want! Leave the place... Go. Sorry, I'm sorry. More sparkling. At what hour will you? It depends. That will keep my children? If my mother is staying with them... We are going there early. You can come with us in the car. She took me to the head. Careful, it's hot! In addition, what is the idea to get married outside of the capital. It is close to Cuernavaca's attractions. So, I won't have any excuse. None of the two of us. I don't have a solution. I'll have to stay until the end of the ceremony, imagines. This is what happens, weddings are all alike. No guest wants to go there, and soon to be even more engaged! This is not true! This will be the same for my wedding? Pay attention to the dishes. No, of course not. Marina has no desire? No really. She loves the marriage. All... What? All women love marriage. Joaquin, I can't. -What is there? -Excuse me. Seriously? I have no patience. Tell me what you need, I'll help you. Sorry, I said no from the beginning. Sorry. Roberto? I returned earlier.

I met Mauricio and Jimena. You are going to take it? So, here we go? You have taught your daughter to drive and arriavnt on the highway she hit a trailer. I wasn't trying to teach him to drive. It is the testimony of your daughter. I have talked about how to lead. But I wasn't trying to teach him. It makes no difference in the procedure. This is just to close the file. Pardon, but it is important. I wasn't trying to teach him to drive. If you want, I can review the documents with my supervisor. You have not presented any no funeral expenses? No. I need a more detailed description what happened to the body of your woman after you have been declared dead. We are going to bury him.

The insurance may pay up to a year for consultations. Thank you, but we don't need. Be careful, asshole! -What is it that you want, asshole? -Asshole! Fuck you! What's your problem? What is it?
