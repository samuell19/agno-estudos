Why do I love animals so much? Juan... Excuse me. The Chief is calling... F-U-K-W-H-M calling. O.K.! Coming... It's always like that. When will you get back? Pssst. He can't get away. Send the obituary. The black or the white one? - The mournful news I said! Look out, he's suspicious... Look out, he's suspicious... He's suspicious... Over... He's suspicious - fire! Juan! Juan! Wait! He's got away again. Pack up! Presents Agent W4C's end through Mr. Frusta's dog story Screenplay Dramatist Cast Music Vocalist Conducted by Editor Sound Engineer Production Manager Director of Photography Directed by Made at Film Studio Barrandov In an unknown foreign city An agency working for an unnamed power Our Agency has got hold of fabulously valuable information: a microfilm of a plan for the military utilization of Venus. We were ready to hand over the microfilm in Prague... in an anonymous town I mean... to our allied White Fog Agency - when our agent... disappeared... The lady working for White Fog is still in Pr... in the anonymous town and the microfilm hidden in a salt-cellar - on the table No 7 of a night-club has to be found and handed over... I'll go to the anonymous town find the salt-cellar with the microfilm and deliver it to the White Fog agent. Is that all? - It's more than enough. Not easy as all that. Get an eyeful of the lady. She may have pinched it herself... What's her name? Alice Roberts, most often. Yes, she may have appropriated the microfilm. You'll worm it out of her. She looks pretty beastly, eh? Uncommonly pretty beastly! How shall I contact her? - You'll find her at the hotel bar. You'll address her: """Shall we dance?""" And she'll answer: ""As soon as I finish my brandy."" M. Dujardin... - Show him in! M. Dujardin, this is out famous W4C. Any new device to show us? An apparently trivial requisite. Inexpert handling, however results in the discharge - of tear-gas! All inventions have their weak points! - I only wanted an explanation... Pull here and you have a dagger. The bell is an effective hand-grenade. Sorry, I mean bomb This here is a universal skeleton key. Winding up will reverse the tape recording. This here is a universal skeleton key. Winding up will reverse the tape recording. The alarm clock also contains a microphone. On - out. If the hands show 12, I repeat, 12 o'clock, a small nuclear explosion follows after 15 seconds. And, what is most important: It has a built-in Geiger counter. That microfilm in Pr... The anonymous town! In ... that town ... was made ... slightly radioactive - and a Geiger counter would be very useful. Still, allow me to remark... What if it is a trap? Of course it is a trap! Our W4C feels in traps at home! We won't even change the film in that lift girl's camera. And, because she's working for all big powers and several lesser powers - that town will be swarming with secret agents... And such troubled waters are W4C's favourite hunting ground. I am sure, dear Cyril Juan, that the precious salt-cellar will get into the proper hands! Keep calm... If salt be wasted what wouldst thou salt with? What? - That's the Scripture! It's the police. He came to ask about a candlestick - dropped from the window. I nearly forgot: It also shoots! Sorry, I'm a bit on edge today. Good thing this is an allied power. There... Gentlemen... Good luck! What a man! Juan... Cyril... This trap will Kill him! Such a difficult case - could only be assigned to W4C. And we'll liquidate him at last. Then we can sell the salt-cellar to all the other agents. Excellent work, Resident! This salt-cellar is worth a billion! - Dollars? Idiot! Crowns! Your task won't be too difficult, Idiot ... err ... Resident. In another unnamed city An agency working for another unnamed power The famous W4C coming to Prague! Yes, he is. What does he want here, anyhow? He has to hand over something to the White Fog agent. Then why bother me with this? Shouldn't we know what it all about? Well, you may be right... Any of our men available? Not one of them. What are you talking about? We have ... err ... Balsanek, Doruzka... They have their assignments! Or ... this here ... Foustka? Mr. Foustka is our bookkeeper! Never mind. He'll do, it's easy enough. Out of order. - Fetch him here! How did you get in here? Just when I'm doing the taxes! What's that? Where's your place? Don't try to talk me over. Where's your place? Nothing doing, you're a naughty doggie - and you'll stand in the corner! Now, stay there... Mr. Foustka, the Chief wants you! I can't. I'm busy! - At once! It's the assessment, probably. Stay where you are, and behave! Come in, Foustka! Excuse me, this clock is slow. And punctuality being the courtesy of kings... That can wait, that can wait Well, Mr. Foustka, I have - we have an assignment for you - and it's external. This gentleman will arrive from Paris by air. We call him... W4C - W4C Follow him from the airport and find out what he's doing here. And that's all, that's all. - All right, I only... All this without any fuss or scandal. Give me a call if necessary! I only wanted... It's nothing difficult. Here, read up these directions... You don't understand, I... I give you two days and it's an order! OK Aren't you an employee of this Agency? - Yes. You are? Well then! - It's only that I've been feeling poorly lately and with that stitch in my side - I need a dietetic treatment... Will that be a problem? Don't worry, Foustka - you'll be treated all right. And if all goes well, you'll be made ... chief accountant. Yes... You are now our... - Agent No 13 B. Well, we're spies now, Pydie. Follow him, he says... But how do we recognize him? Where's your manners?! Put your paws down! W4C is landing in a few minutes. Task No 1: Eliminate W4C. Task No 2: Sell the salt-cellar for the highest price. All the Agencies are greatly interested. The place will be swarming with agents I repeat, it is worth a billion! Where are you going to hide it? - In a safe, of course. Idiot! Every burglar goes straight for the safe. I know from experience, that the most conspicuous place is least conspicuous. Everything ready at the hotel? - Yes. To your stations! Attention, attention! The flight from Paris has just landed The flight from Paris has just landed. Qu'est-ce que c'est, monsieur? Looking for a light blue car, sir? My aunt has a light blue one. - Your uncle is expecting you. Have all passengers alighted yet? Gone through the customs already. - This one too? Funny! Here we are What does this mean?! The light blue car is being repaired. We're getting near, get ready! Step on it! Get back there! Get out and push! Dear me... Such a lot of glass - that's pretty inconsiderate... Pydie, I got no patches. Darn it! Get away! It's empty! What's up? Where's the fire? Come here, Pydie! Hide here, quick! See him? That's him all right. After him! Instead of arriving by plane - he comes up from a sewer! Or is it a remote heating? Who's down there? I see you! You won't come out? Just you wait... Good Lord, what a stink... Home already, Pydie? Good doggie... Found out anything? Calm down... What's up? What's the matter with you? All right, I'm coming! No one's going to steal it! Now lead on! Not so fast - I'm no dog! Which way? Make up your mind! Where shall we put it? - Into the safe, of course! Every fool - goes straight for the safe! I know from experience - the most conspicuous place to be least conspicuous. You got to think a bit... Aha Know him? No... He's cunningly disguised. I'll sound him myself! No, I won't let you in! Don't wave your arms - calling attention to me! Just take a look at yourself! Oh... I'm from the street-cleaning department. Hmmm... - All right ... no street-cleaning. I'm going to tell you - but don't give me away. I might get into trouble. I am the agent No 13B. Are you? Hmmm... I see... Come on in! Come on! Come in, come int - Shush, be a good boy... Here's a brush. Thanks Towel and soap at the lavatory. OK A dog! Is that your dog? - Yes. I can't let it in. - It's a trained dog. Well, as it's your... What's your assignment here, anyway? I can't tell you. - Why? Well, it's so secret - that I don't know myself. A darn difficult job this! Well, thank you very much. - Don't mention it. Who is it? An imbecile! And that's him? - Yes, disguised too. A small smile plays on my face hiding the sadness inside But when the tears flow from my eyes life feels sweet A face of lies and deception that only a young girl can see One that will break the hearts of innocents in the world at large I used to laugh like other girls What a handsome man! But what a terrible mistake I made A man enticed me to play a game and then he broke my heart Since that day I cry my tears when others think to laugh and laugh at times of sadness deep which tums funerals into a farce G15 calling.

"She said ""the Resident""!" This wench knows everything! She has to be eliminated. What does she say now? - I can't hear her - she keeps turning around. She keeps turning around... Only a fool would bug a chandelier! Now they won't trust each other and as soon as they start murdering one another we'll eliminate W4C We'll get rid of the witness, that Alice and we'll sell the goods - to the highest bidder. Do you know it is worth a billion? Hmmm... A billion what, Stern? I don't care. What do you mean? If you think it's dollars - you're an idiot. A billion crowns, eh? Hand it over, Stern! - What? I'm asking you nicely, hand it over Think you'll sell it - and leave me in the soup? You were always slow - in fixing the silencer! One of my best men... You inspire confidence. - Think so?

The latest novelty! - A novelty! A novelty! - A novelty! American lemonade, please? - Why American? We serve no other sort. - Didn't I tell you ... He has an alarm-clock!

Dam it! Some defect! More advanced technology will win every time. Only human beings are irreplaceable! The salt-cellar is practically mine now. - Certainly. And the price? It is worth a billion, but we'll leave all this to the agencies. It had to be handed over - and we made a quick job of it! Such a lot of money! And I left it on the table. I'd better take it to a safe place. You can take it away now! We have to get that salt-cellar! Come on! Wait! Wait, I say! Cyril, did you lock the door? - Nobody would dare to come in! Ouch! - Sorry.

I am leaving at twelve - I'm having lunch in Casablanca. Has anything happened here? - Nothing, I'm sorry to say! What now? Let's try it over there... Dammit... Not cleared up yet! Come here! Come! I feel a draught - it has to end here somewhere ...because you lost the salt-cellar and W4C is still alive! If you don't make it right till twelve, you'll have to swallow the red ball! Listen well! Firstly: W4C! Secondly: Before Alice Roberts dives, the swimming pool has to be charged with 200.000 Volts. 200.000 Volts. The body will be removed by a device made ready beforehand. That girl know too much! The cabin will be your command post. Now - don't forget! - No, no! You understood perfectly? - Yes. Yes or no? - I said I understood. I can only hear a whistling sound. It must be you mikes! ... Hear me? Just a moment! They were functioning all right... I can hear you now! Don't forget: Firstly and secondly! Out! Hmmm... What sort of a trap is this? We've been here before... Wait... And we didn't notice this here! Now, run! What's so precious about it? Don't sniff like that, there's a billion in that! Where is it though?! We'll have to ask. Up Pydie, up! Hallo, Chief, will you please - give me some information about salt? Foustka, the agent, speaking. What's all that nonsense? I told you I was a dietarian. I'm not allowed to use salt. That's why salt is double Dutch to me. Dutch? I have a dictionary... That fellow W4C told the young lady - it was worth a billion. Which young lady? The one they want to kill in the swimming pool tomorrow. You gave me her photo... You must prevent it! We can't have ladies killed in our swimming-pools! Think of our tourism! I hold you responsible for the pool! Got your regulation bathing-drawers? So what?! I say, Chief ... Hallo ... We shouldn't have taken the job, eh? Swimmers, get ready! When are you head-diving? - After the intermission. Why? I want to see it! - And the salt-cellar? At eleven, as I told you! Your ticket! Haven't got one. They're sold out. Then stay out! Pydie, try and make some confusion - so I can sneak in! Got it working? - Yes. 200.000 Volt. You sure nobody's in the pool yet? Well, you see To your stations! Everything O.K. sir, as expected - the stadium is full of people - the trouble is, I can't get in. There were no tickets to be got... You bungler, you could have bought tickets in advance! - Kindly remember, Chief ... Look up the directions - given in your booklet! I did - paragraph 15 - how to work one's way into the Headquarters. Not a word about swimming-baths! Get in through the conduit, or disguised as the Mayor! Use your head, Foustka! Use your head ... Says he ... Disguised as the Mayor... I'd rather crawl in through the pipes! Monsieur... well, you're finally here let's go inside...sofort... Your ticket! - Your ticket! No use talking! Your ticket! - Got no ticket? Stay outside! ...the 100 metre breast stroke final for this year's championship. The lanes were drawn as follows Starting block No 1- Ron Wyler of New Zealand, Block No 2 - Juan Alvarez, Ecuador... Isn't that your Edward? And he said he was a poor swimmer! In Ecuador children start swimming at the age of three. 97,2% using the breast stroke and the back stroke, the rest. You know everything, Juan! About antique culture, for instance. But I'm taking an interest in it. Excuse me. Pydie! Bite ... bite ... bite! Bite it through and then sick him! Come in. To your blocks! ...this inconspicuous Ecuadorian's stroke seems rather slow, but you ought to see his legs under the surface... The greatest surprise of this contest was the victory of the Ecuadorian - Juan Alvarez, whose style ... Dear listeners, I can only say, it was a really wonderful show. We hope to get the champion to the microphone .. The diving competition will begin with a double back-summersault executed by Miss Alice Roberts... Will you, please - at this happy occasion - say a few words to out listeners? We must prevent murder! Bravo! Bravo! Dear listeners, this admirable Ecuadorian athlete - the winner of the 100m race, in his finest sporting hour, not only speaks good Czech, but he's also made an appeal for World Peace! Hold this for me! - Right...Ladies and... You won't! What's bitten you, Edward? Come down! You mustn't dive! The pool is charged with high voltage! Take it easy, gentlemen! Let me prove it! Look! The salt-cellar! The salt-cellar! At eleven sharp! What's that?... Jesus Christ... Dammit! A different sound. It's wet. Step on it! We must get him! We can't allow that sort of thing here! You are disqualified! Why? Good mooing... Come here, Pydie! We shouldn't have taken this job! This is yours. Wait a minute! Faster! And to the left! Take off your shoes! They are indestructible. I sometimes think, I haven't chosen a nice profession. Oh, really? Bon voyage, my boy... Darling... We gotta overtake him! Three...Two...One...Go! Eight minutes left for us. Too short a time for lovers! He's got away again! You can choose! Marie Novakova, Hongkong, Marie Novakova, Hongkong, Marie Novakova, Hongkong... Your passports, please! The alarm clock! Fetch it! Good doggie ... Hold this! Interesting. And old timepiece - keeping bad time... Hello, Edward, - Keeping bad time... The alarm-clock, I mean. - I know, Edward. No manners! - Thank you. A window-seat on the right, please! Not above the wing! Juan! Eat it! A pool full of corpses! W4C blown to kingdom come! Foustka, you've disrupted the whole European spy-network You've destroyed the reason for our existence! That's as may be - but the young lady was saved. And you bring me this stuff! It's said to be worth a milliard! A billion? - What am I to do with it? It's beyond my planned revenue. Which one is it? ... This one? - I'll soon know. Edward, the salt-cellars! Edu... I'll return the brief-case, Edward. There .. the milliard is gone. Couldn't you offer resistance? This gimmick is out of order again! Why didn't your bitch jump at her and worry her? He was meant to jump on her and tear her to pieces! - He couldn't. What do you mean he couldn't? - Holding the salt-cellar in his mouth. Which salt-cellar? - The right one. Pydie, let him have it! Foustka! ... Let me hug you! Now it's functioning! Mr. Foustka, why did that woman call you Edward? She was mistaking me for a schoolmate of hers. And ... do you ... know her intimately? Well... Mr. Foustka, this is most valuable indeed! It really is a plan for the military utilizations of Venus. You'll be promoted from Agent 13B to ... Agent 13A! Pydie, here boy We shouldn't have taken this job. Why, Mr. Foustka? He said I'd be appointed Chief accountant - didn't he? And now an agent again, right? The End
