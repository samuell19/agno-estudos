So typically British... Not a chance. My name is Markus. -Gabriel. Gabriel. Neat name. Well... Just a wild guess... You're the cuddly one, right? You know, the one girls can talk to when someone's been mean to them. They come to you when their boyfriend has dumped them or something, right? Is it that obvious? -Kind of. Isn't that right? -Maybe. I mean, that's all right. -Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that. Someone has to do it. Aren't you going to get dressed? -No. Come on. You have to show up on the first day. This is OK. -Yeah, this is all right. She's hot. -The teacher? You little weasel. The chick who sat next to me. She's not exactly a 10. -No, maybe not. I just hope there are some pubs in this place. Pubs? -Yeah. I doubt we'll get into any pubs. I came prepared. I got some ID from my brother, Aron. But I'll have to do something about your look. -My look? Is there something wrong with it? -It's fine in the Icelandic sticks. I'm not digging this. Your hair is cool. What's with this shirt? This is just my shirt. It's cool. What are we supposed to do? Just sit here? No, we'll just chill a little. -OK Check this out. What? This hairstyle is fucking great. -Fuck off. You've ruined my hair. Admit it, I'm the man. OK, you're the man. -I'm the man. I'm going to get a drink. Do you want something? I'd like a coke. You don't ask for a coke at an English pub. What's wrong with you? My mom will kill me if I mess up this trip. Save some of this. I'm going to the bar. Want a coke? Coke. -Thank you. Cheers. A toast for the coke. -For the coke. What are you doing? I'm trying to study. Relax. You're taking this too seriously. I'm taking this too seriously? How would you know? You've never shown up. -Sure I have. Mom will kill me if I mess this up. That's not good. But we'll have to have some fun tonight. I have to finish this. OK, we'll have an ice cold beer when you're done. I have to finish this. -OK. Yes. Finish it then so we can go. -Shut up then! Yes. -Thank you. Are you done soon? You can't finish if you don't have a pen. We ruled the dance floor. -I know. Can you open this? Did you check out that Asian chick? -No. At the bar? -No. Too bad for you. -Yeah? She was wearing a crotch-high skirt. Wait a second. Let's make a deal. If you guess who this is, I can have your beer. Why would I want to give you my beer? What are you doing? Matthew MacConaughey, Dazed and Confused. You have to give me your beer. Excuse me. Thank you. Are you going to school next year? I don't think so, although I want to go to hairdressing school in London. If that doesn't work out I'll just get a job back home. I could never leave school and get a job. -Why not? You know, all the kids at school... All my friends... -Of course. What about your friends? Aren't they in school? Yeah... I don't know. What are you going to do when you get back home? I'll probably try to find some work until school starts. Mom had found a job for me. It's in an old folk's home, though. Washing old men? -Yeah. Not a chance. How are they? Who? The old folk? Your mom and dad. They're all right. They're divorced. Dad is all right. Mom can be a little difficult. Isn't everything all right? -Yeah. Well, aren't you going to tell us about your trip? It was fine. I got to know a few Icelanders. Wow! A few Icelanders... Sounds great. No, really. How was it? Mom, we were just in school. It was fine. Well, dear. It would be nice to hear something about your trip. I'm not in the mood. Someone is feeling depressed. Wasn't it fun? Yes, it was just fine. I'm not in the mood to talk about it. Do you think you'll be in the mood tomorrow? Hi. -Hi, man. Are you home? -Yes. Nice. Great not hearing from you. It was a little hard to be alone with the girls all the time. You're not going to be gone for so long again. Yeah, I'm so damn irreplaceable. -Have you started cursing? What happened in Manchester? -Nothing. What do you mean? Is it Gabriel? Tell him about the party. What? -The party? We're having a party tomorrow at Greta's. You have to be there. Stella is dying to see you. Shut up, Teddi. Has she been OK? Yeah, you know... I don't know. I haven't been watching her. She's probably fine. What about you and Tara? Have you quit fooling around? You know how the chicks go after me. You know how they dress. I don't have much of a choice. -You're such a slut. Welcome back. -Thanks. I've missed you so much. -Likewise. You're here already? -Yeah, what's up? How was the trip? -It was fine. Did you score? -Score? Don't be so naive. What's this? How strong is it? -74 proof. Not too much. Relax, don't be such a pussy. And? -And what? How was it? What happened? -It was fine. Nothing special happened. You were away for three weeks and nothing special happened? We were just in school. It was fine. This mix is a little strong. Come to the bathroom. -No. Stop it! Have a drink. -No, I don't want to. Are you having your period? No, I just don't want to. Stop it. Have some water. How have you been? -It's been up and down. Did something happen? -No, nothing like that. What's this? What's going on? -I missed you. What are you doing, Teddi? It's always something, you know. Your period or something. Are you retarded? Tara, wait! What's the matter? -She's been such a bitch tonight. Gabriel, my dear! How you've grown. Mom, what do you think you're doing? What are you doing? I don't want to talk to you. Can I have a word with you? -Isn't this my home? Yes, but isn't this my party? -I live here. For once, I'm having a party. Can you just leave me alone? Let's just get drunk. -You know I don't drink. I don't want to listen to this. You're boring. Why do you always have to act like this? -I live here! Relax! You're such a moron. You're such a moron. Didn't you just say it yourself? Yes, but I said it myself. What were you thinking? You've made a mess of everything. I was just horny that night. Anyway, I only fingered this girl. That's all right then. No... You have to call here for me. She always hangs up on me. I can't always clean up your mess for you. You can at least talk to Stella. She talks to her many times a day. Stella is furious with you. Is she? -Yes. There's not a chance. -You can at least try. I can try, but I can't promise anything. It wasn't my fault. I was so juiced that night. Juiced? -I don't know... Try to tell her that my conscience is killing me. Did I wake you up? -Kind of. Where are you? Wait a second. I'm just home. Tara slept over tonight. What a crazy night. Teddi is a moron. I know he's your friend, but he's a moron. Yeah, but don't you think that Tara will take him back? Not a chance. Have you heard from him? A little. He's a complete mess. -Serves him right. I start work at the store tomorrow. Come and see me. OK, I'll drop by tomorrow. I have to go. Grandma is listening in. Have you heard from Tara? -Yeah, she's asleep upstairs. I can't live with this hag anymore. I'm going to move. Where will you move? You see rent ads everywhere. Can't I just rent something? How will you pay the rent? Do you have any money? I'll just have to get another extra job. You know that anything's better than living with my mom. In this rathole. It's a shame. There's always some trouble with the old lady. I know. Did you see her yesterday? No, we just ran into her when we were leaving. She screamed at me in front of everyone and then she started messing with Gabriel. I can't stand her. There's something wrong with her. The register is self-explanatory. Everything's quite simple, the vegetables and all that. You'll get the hang of this in no time. You'll usually be working with Mitrovic. He can help you. Does he speak Icelandic? Yes, he speaks great Icelandic. His nephew also works here sometimes. His Icelandic is not that good. Just ask Mitrovic or me. You have my phone number. Don't you want to try? Let's start with some vegetables. Carrots and... It's afternoon and you're eating Cocoa Puffs in your pyjamas? Where does this damn Cocoa Puffs come from? Did you buy it? What's the matter, Gabriel? -Nothing. Doesn't matter. What doesn't matter? There's something going on. Spare me, mom. Didn't you score in Manchester? What? I was in English school. That doesn't mean you can't get laid. -Not me. What about you? Aren't you scoring? What about this guy you were talking about? -What guy? The one you were telling me about before I went to Manchester. You didn't want to tell me who he was. You know you're the only man in my life. You know you can trust me. I just told you. -You know I'll find out. Is he cute? Shut up. Who are you texting? -No one. Who is this guy? Don't change the subject. I'm not. Who are you texting? -No one. Give me that. -Not a chance. You're being really dubious. -Come on. How's Tara? -Not so good. Poor girl. Hi, Gabriel. -Hi. Are you smoking in here? -No. There's so much smoke in the hallway. Close the door, grandma. You know it's just incense. You're just nosy. Turn it out. It gives you such a headache. She's such a pain in the ass. She watches everything I do. She's always breathing down my neck. She can relax. I'm nothing like my mother. Doesn't she just have her reasons? -Maybe. You've been so strange since you came. Something bothering you? Don't you start too. There's nothing wrong. Not that I know of. -That's what you say. Hi, dear. -What's up? Nice to see you. Have a seat, Gabriel. Yes. Well... Mom, are you going to start again with these family meetings? Why don't you just give up? There's always a reason for having a family meeting. Your father and I have noticed certain changes in you that cause certain suspicions. What are you talking about? I talked to your father and he thought that it was right to have a little chat with you. Did you try some kind of drugs in England? No, I didn't try any drugs in England. I can take a drug test if you don't believe me. I'll pee in front of you whenever you want. Well no, that's... -Shut up. You have to understand our worries. The times have changed and temptations are everywhere. We have to believe the boy. You wouldn't expect him to be in that kind of trouble. You never know. This has been brought up, anyway. How's school? It's still summer vacation. But you did good this spring? -Yes. That's the most important thing. Will you hunt reindeer this year? Yes, we'll be in sector three, but I applied for them all. We were there last year, but I prefer sector two. Right now, I'd really like to know where he is. Who? -My dad. Don't you know his name? I know that his name is Haraldur and that he is a complete loser. She promised me that someday she would tell me who he is. Isn't it about time? Hi. -Hi. How are you? -Fine. We're on our way out. We're looking at an apartment. Are you going to rent an apartment? Just she. I'm going to get going. I just got a contract at a salon. My first day. -OK. Do you want to come by later? I'll use you as a guinea pig. Guinea pig! I'm not sure... Of course you'll go, Gabriel. Get a haircut. Drop by later. You're cool. See you later. Who was that? Just a friend. I met him in Manchester. Isn't this a nice apartment? -Very nice. Very cozy. Nice kids? -Yeah. A little peculiar. Don't be alarmed by the mess in the hallway. You've met Hallur. -Yeah, hi. Greta, right? -Greta, yes. This is Freyja. -Hi And Geiri. -Hi. Walk around. Your room is right next to mine. Don't you want to take a look? Good afternoon. Are you going to the party tonight? Welcome. There's beer, punch and vodka in the kitchen. I can understand two or four hours, but now she's just being spiteful. You're such an idiot. She's just hurt. Understandably. But still, this wasn't anything serious. Hi! Nice haircut. Answer one question... Who threw up on you? I'll find him and beat him up for you. Get bent. Seriously. No, really. What is this? -High lights. No shit. Why do you have this? -I don't know. Just a little change. You have to get used to it. A little change? He got a new plumage. Like a bird. Are you finished? -Just about. I'll have another. Hi, Tara, it's me. Why didn't you come to the party? You know, I can explain, Greta understood me. I want everybody out! -It's my home too. Quiet! This isn't a damn club! Geiri is acting like an idiot. Just come. Do you want to talk to Geiri? Bye! You're just drunk and boring. I can understand that you're mad but now you're just spiteful. Spiteful, that's a word. What a bitch. Are. you having fun? -Yeah, aren't you coming? I'm on my way. -OK, see you then. Wait a minute. Hi, Gabriel. How's it going? -Fine. Come on in. This is my brother, Aron. Aron, this is Gabriel. Is that the guy who was with you in Manchester? Yes, he kept me alive. Look at you. Are you stoned? -No. Me neither. We just have some booze. Would you like a beer? -Yes. Let me know if you find some pot or something. This is my friend, Lara. Hi, Lara. -Gabriel. Have a seat. Everything OK? -Yeah, great. Mitrovic! Have you known Markus for long? Yes and no. I'm good friends with Aron. Do you have a girlfriend, Gabriel? -No. Why? Have a shot. Open the register you cow! Sorich! Call the police. What's the number? -112. Hurry! He took my necklace. Why don't we meet more often? -I don't know. We should. -No doubt How are you? -Fine. And you? Just fine. What is this? -Just taste it. Are you drunk? Have some. -No, I'm done. Go home, kids. There's nothing happening here. Hurry! Just take it easy tonight. Walk her to her door. -Yes. Isn't everything all right? -Do you know where Markus is? Hasn't he just left? -I don't know. He won't go far. Thanks for the help. -No problem. See you later. I saw that it was a friend of Nemjana. Of course I'm sure, try to get some information. I don't want Stella and her friends finding out that we know these jerks. Just find him. Stella... What are you doing? Come. Lie down. You're not getting this, are you? -What? No way, Greta. And I don't have any money. No way, Greta. And I don't have any money. I have the rent. I just didn't know about this insurance fee. You'll have to figure it out. It was your decision. I did it because you're impossible to live with, mom. Come on, Greta. You're always having some damn parties. You're never home anyway. No, because I can't stay in this rathole with you. I'll be going then. -Yes. I'll call you. What's his name? -I don't know. Not that one. Haraldur. Your father? Why, Greta? He's a loser. I don't care. I just want to know his name. Are you just going to knock on his door, smile and introduce yourself? You promised me that I could at least know his name. Yes. Are you going to tell me then? You're unbelievable. Move over. Are you satisfied now? That's him. His name is Haraldur Simonarson. Haraldur Simonarson? When was this picture taken? Sixteen years ago, of course. At a festival. Hi. She doesn't want to help me. You know I'll end up as a stripper. She's such a bitch. -I know, she sucks. She told me my father's name. Really? Then it's a piece of cake. We'll just get him to pay. What's wrong with you? I only want to know who he is. Let's google him. Hi. -Hi. Where were you? At the record store. And? -There's nothing available. Judda is googling my father. Have you found something? I need to know his name first. Haraldur, Haraldur Simonarson. Do you know his last name? Mom just told me. Really? -Yes. We need some money for Greta. Is he supposed to get the money? I don't know what she's thinking. What have you found? This one was born in the 80s so it can't be him. This is some handball guy. Is this guy a complete nobody? -Probably. Would you recognise a picture of him? I've seen one photo of him but it was an old one. Could it be this one? He does look a little like you. I think it's him. -Really? Let me see. Yes! He has a Facebook page. I'll just send him a message. I made a Facebook page. I found some photos online of this girl and called her Mjoll. I've added friends of Haraldur and two have already accepted me. Check this out. ''Hi, Haraldur, you look so familiar, were you working at Kaupthing bank four years ago? Mjoll.'' -You're crazy. Mom! What the hell are you doing? You never tell me anything so I just... What's wrong with you? What do you need to know? Why you avoid your home and why you avoid me. Do you think it's all right to look at my computer? What am I supposed to do? -Get out now! You don't order me about in my own house. What's up? -Just my mom. She can't be worse than grandmother. -Don't be too sure. About the other night... -Yes. Wait a minute. Mitrovic, can you take the register? -Yes. Don't you get it? -Yes, I think so. I just can't believe that I'm the one who... -Gabriel. There are so many things that I want to tell you. It's all right, really. Mitrovic asked me to the movies. -Great. Stella, come over here. There you go. I found him. No money, but he gave me this. Let's notify the police. -I'll do it. I don't know how I'll explain this to Stella. Greta, he replied! No, I've never worked at a bank, fortunately. I work as a massage therapist. You're always welcome if your back is troubling you. Massage therapist? I'm so going to get a massage. Thanks for tonight. -You too. See you tomorrow. -Yes. Maybe we can do this again sometime? Grandmother is coming. I don't want to meet her. Stella, get out of the car at once! Would you mind. He's just a friend. A friend. Quit it. You're embarrassing me. Go away. That is, if you understand Icelandic. Grandmother! -I'm Russian but I've lived here for five years so I know the language. Don't listen to her. As you can hear she's just retarded. Just go, I can't stand this. You're such a bitch. Shut up, leave me alone! So you've come to save the world? So you've come to save the world? What's going on? What is she doing hanging around with these damn foreigners? Everyone knows what this flirting leads to. He's just a really nice guy. -Nice! You're too young to know how these Talibans can be. I wasn't surprised when I heard that Stella's mother had died. When she went to Denmark with this lowlife, I begged her not to take Stella with her. She was only five years old. But she took her with her. I just don't know what to do. She's so prejudiced. She's ruining my life. Judith. -Yes. Walk this way. Greta! Hi. -Hi. How was it? Are you sure this is your father? Am I sure? He was just incredibly nice. I can't believe he's such a loser. How did he look? Is he tall? Kind of cute. Tall and dark- haired. Just really nice. Really? We were just talking at Tara's place last night. I nailed her. -No! She's going to give me another chance. Very nice. Do me and everybody else a favor. Don't screw this up. I'm not screwing anything up. Relax. Just a Coke. -Same for me. What's new? -Quite a lot. Greta's father massaged me and I have to say, he's cute. You should get to know him. Maybe you'll be Greta's stepmom. Teddi! He's an old man. How old are you supposed to be when you get to be an old man? Forty. They become old right away when they reach forty. I've heard that they become smelly, pot-bellied and crazy for young meat. Thats you, babe. -You're disgusting. Or they're jerking off over anal sex on the net. Watch your mouth. They know how to live the life. -Shut up for once. I like you better like this than crying on my shoulder. You're here already? Your father and we decided to have a little chat. Have a seat. -I'm done with this. I'm sixteen. Don't think you're grown up although you're sixteen. We're here because nothing has changed since our last family meeting. You're never home and we have no idea what's going on in your life. Mom, I'm just hanging out with my friends. You could have gotten a job when you came back from England. You know that I applied for jobs. All the summer jobs were taken. I'm still waiting for a reply from the record store. I know you could have gotten that job at the old folks home. I drew the line at wiping old people's behinds. Why are we the only ones talking? Why do you drag them here? We are all responsible for you, although I seem to be the only one who carries on a discussion at these meetings. In meetings, it's generally the pushy ones who speak, but I understand that you haven't been home much and I want to you know that we are your family and that you can talk to us if something's wrong. It can just be a little chat now and then. Then you could try to be home when I'm home. I'm not always out, you're just not home at the same time. It's just a coincidence, I'm not trying to avoid you. You are our only son and our friendship is important to me. You are my mother, you can never be a close friend. We can be close, of course, but you know what I mean. I'm just worried. I feel like you're shutting us off. Just trust me, mom. Isn't this good for today? I'll just take the old boy with me to McDonalds. Thanks for the coffee. I'll drive him home later. Dad, I can't stand these family meetings. You have to do something. Do you think I can do anything? The woman is and always has been a control freak. It's best to do as she says to avoid serious trouble. You don't go there with your mother. Poor Bjoggi... You can still back me up. That's right. I could do more. Do you want to drive? -I'm only sixteen. It's OK to try a little circle here. I'm taking chemistry. Who needs to learn chemistry? Didn't you choose this course? -Yeah, but you know... Chemistry. But science is your main course. Then you have to do chemistry. I'm very pleased with my classes. There's such a big gap between classes on Mondays. Just allow someone to fill the gap. Then everything will be all right. You know about my Facebook page. I've been chatting with Haraldur and things are heating up. Are you kidding? I'll kill you if you cross the line. I think she's just about to. I invited him on a date on Wednesday. Are you kidding me? -No. This is getting interesting! You've messed with him far too much. Just stand him up and stop contacting him. I want to sit at the next table. Why don't you just talk to him? -Me? Come on! -Not a chance. What is he going to say to him? And this ignorant friend of mine is a really bad liar. Can we just stop talking about this? -Sure. - I'll just go. -We're with you. I think he's coming. There's someone coming. It's him! -Is this him? Nice! He's a hottie. I can't back out now, can I? -No. Just go and talk to him. Excuse me, remember me? -Yes, how are you? Can I have a seat? I'm expecting someone. Yes, about that... That's kind of me. Are you Mjoll? Kind of. But she doesn't exist. Wait! I have to talk to you. It's about your daughter, Greta. What? She's my flatmate and she's having some money problems. Her mother can't help her so we thought about asking the man who has never had anything to do with his daughter for help. Do you think this is the best way to find people? Is something wrong with you? -Is something wrong with you? You don't know anything about this. Don't you think I have my reasons? Could be, but Greta doesn't know anything about your reasons. What happened? -He just freaked out and left. Go after him. Go! Maybe she'll hit him. Isn't she supposed to know anything about these reasons of yours? You're the one who spit her out into the world. -I spit her out? I was dead drunk and vaguely remember meeting this woman. Then she called three months later and said she was pregnant. I don't even remember sleeping with her. So that's it then? No, when I offered to take a blood test she didn't want to speak to me. If she doesn't want to speak to me I can't be the father, right? Are you ready for a DNA test now? What about Greta? Come on! What happened? He didn't say shit. -You should have hit him. Just let it go. I don't want to ask my mother about this guy. Maybe we should just relax. I agree that we should take a break from this. If you want to do something later we'll do it. I've been applying for more shifts here. You'll have to be free on Thursday. I'm having a party before the dance. You have to be there. Is he waiting outside in the car? Yes. You're not going anywhere. This is my life. -Stella! Hi. Tara! -Hi! Who was this faggot? -Just a guy I know. Who? -Steini. Have you been seeing him? -No. Then why did he say hi like that? -Like that? Yes. -I just know him. This wasn't like that. It was a real faggoty hi. What's wrong with you? Stop it. This is not a strong mix. -Yes it is. How is this dress? Can I go in this? I look fat. -You don't look fat. Yes I do. See this? -No, you look great. See these hips. Do you think I'll get through the door? We already talked about this. You haven't said anything. -You look really great. Just don't get too drunk. I'm never too drunk. -No, never... If you drank, you'd understand. -Yes, I don't understand. I always have more fun than you when we go out. I'm always just fine. I'd have more fun if I weren't so fat. Where are you? Aren't you going to reply? What are you drinking? Some disgusting mix from Teddi. It's like drinking pure alcohol. He's just trying to get you drunk. Is it disgusting? I don't want to be sober. It's disgusting to be sober at a dance. Kiss me. -Kiss you? No. I know you want me. -Do I? Don't be like this. I don't kiss people out of the blue. Don't tell me you're romantic. -I'm not saying that. Stop it. You're making me embarrassed. Do you want to go to the room? No, I don't want to go into the room. Don't you want to ask me out? Isn't that how it works? Do you want me to ask you out? -No. Just leave me alone. I think you have to take her home. -Yes. She's not handling this. We're going to the dance. No problem, I'll do it. Isn't everything OK? -Yeah, it's OK. She's not going to the dance. Aren't you feeling well? Are you taking her home? -Yes, I'll do it. See you. Can't we get going as well? -Yeah, soon. Are you all right? -Yes. Don't you want this to dry your dress? Let's just go to your place. Hello, no she went with Mitrovic. GRANDMA Good evening. -Good evening. Good evening. -Good evening. There's a foreigner who works here. I need to know where he lives. Do you mean Soric? You know who I mean. The one Stella's been with. You mean Mitrovic. -Yes, find out where he lives. I don't have his address here but I can find out. Yes, please. I'm in a hurry. What took you so long? -I just got held up. Where were you? -On my way. We're getting laid! How many have you drunk? -None. Are you sober? -Yes. You're such a dork. They're not testing. -I know. I'll just go be a minute. Aren't you coming with me? -I'll be there in a second. How are you? -Fine. Why don't you answer your phone? -I don't know. You can at least text me. We can at least talk. -I'm just not interested. You're not interested? -No. What do you mean? -You know what I mean. I just don't want to talk to you. Are you kidding? -No, I'm not kidding. Open up, Stella! I know you're up there! Open up! Leave me alone. I'm spending the night with him. Stop this nonsense! Get dressed and come out! Leave me alone! Go away! Come with me at once! Do as I say! -Leave me alone! I'll leave you alone when you're home. How do you think I feel? You're such a brat! How is it upstairs? -Fun, we're going to dance. Do you know where Gabriel is? He's talking to some guy. At least have the guts to talk to me. -Leave me alone! Just go if you don't want to talk to me. What's going on? Is something wrong with you? Gabriel is gay! Hello. -Gabriel, where are you? I don't want to talk to you, Teddi. He was just joking, Gabriel. You're not gay? I don't want to talk about this, Teddi. Teddi, I said that I don't want to talk to you. You have to come, Gabriel. She doesn't make a sound. What are you talking about? I went to get her and she just lost all control. Get her? Where? To Mitrovic? I didn't want her there. Can't you come now, Gabriel? She doesn't answer me. I've tried and tried. Are you insane? Can you come now? She doesn't answer. She doesn't make a sound. Open up, Stella. Let's talk. Thank god you're here. Stella, can you hear me? Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Give mercy and grace to the living, pardon and rest to the dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul and grant you peace. May the Lord bless you and keep you. May He lift up His countenance and grant you peace. In the name of the Father, amen. I'll be right back. Gabriel, I just wanted to say... -You don't have to say anything. I know. I just wanted to ask you if you know where Stella's cross is? No. If someone knows where it is... Mitrovic, I just wanted to say that I... Hello. I hope this is not a bad time but I wanted to talk to you. Who is this? My name is Greta. Yes, I met your friend the other day. I know. Sorry about that. It's just me this time. I wanted to talk about this. I would like for us to meet and talk things over. Of course I can meet you. I wish I could take you with me. He would run to the hills if he saw me. Now I'm so stressed I could throw up. It's just some guy. He's not God almighty. Are you sure I don't look fat in these pants? See. Greta? -Hi. Sorry I'm late. -That's alright. This is so absurd. -Yes, rather uncomfortable. I don't know what I'm doing. Wasn't this about some insurance money? No, that came from my friend. I just wanted to see you. Just finish this so I don't have to think about it anymore. This is probably good for the both of us. -I think so. It's no fun feeling like half a person. You look rather whole to me. Isn't it just one half who needs to know where he came from? I guess. This has been such a weird day without Stella around. This has been such a weird day without Stella around. It's so strange not to be able to call her. And just go and see her. I call her every day just to get hear her answer message. Remember when she first came to class? I thought she was some kind of satanist. Did you know that she liked me? Yes, she always did. I never realized anything. -Gabriel, it wasn't your call. What about this Markus? What happened in Manchester? There's not much to say. One night we just kissed. We were both drunk and then everything changed. Such as? For the first time, I felt these jitters that everyone talks about but at the same time I didn't want to believe that I was gay. I kind of wished that it wasn't true. This is great. Really. Then what? Then I saw him with some girl at a party. Is he bi or what? -I don't know. Can you talk to me, Gabriel? -I'm coming. How are you? -Fine. Where's mom? At some meeting. Who's with you? -Greta. Is everything all right? -Yes. I want to have a little chat with you, Gabriel. How is your social life? -What? How... Gabriel, do you think you could be homosexual? -What? Gay. What do you mean? There's nothing wrong with it. I haven't mentioned it to your mom. I just looked at your computer... I thought it was my computer, but then I saw... It's OK, Gabriel. If you're ready to talk about it, I'll... What were you thinking? -I don't know. Why were you with her? -I was just drunk and stupid. I just wasn't sure about this. You're the first guy I've kissed. -I didn't know. You're also my first. -I know. What happens next? -I don't know. I haven't got laid for so long I feel like I'm in eighth grade. Like sixth grade for you, eighth grade for me. Yeah, right. Dream on. What's with the frown? Haven't got laid for a long time? No, not for a really long time. How are you anyway? -Everything's such a mess. Why? -I met Markus today. Are you two okay? -Okay and not okay.. I don't know. We're not not OK, anyway. It's good that you talked? -Yes. What a smell. I'm going. Judith, tell Hallur to do the dishes and clean up. I'm freaking out, this is so disgusting. Hi. -Hi. If you don't have the money tomorrow I'll throw you out. Geiri, easy on the throwing people out. I'll have it tomorrow. I don't know about you but I'm really hot for Geiri. The hottest guy. How are you going to figure this out? I took extra shifts and got paid in advance so I'll have the money tomorrow. -OK, great. Which reminds me... I'm going out to meet Haraldur again. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. See you. -Bye. Good luck. Let's get drunk. -Yes, that's sensible. No, really. I have beer and some vodka shots. It's not like you have something better to do. You're joking right? -No. Do I really have to undress? Yes, one shot and then undress. Again? Yes! A king. An ace! That's not an ace, Gabriel. That's a four. That's a four. I win, you have to take a shot. Take off your shirt. Gabriel, you lost. Not a chance. You lost. -I didn't lose. Off with the shirt. -No. You take off your shirt. -Take this off. I'm not taking off my shirt! What time is it? -You'll be late for school. This thing last night... -Don't think about it. Sorry, but I don't know... -Let's forget about it. Since it happened, I've just been interested in... this thing. I was wondering if we... can maybe and get to know each other better. I must admit that I would really like that. Thank god for the weekend. This week was really hard. Do you have any plans, Gabriel? -Maybe catch a movie. Isn't there a new Icelandic movie that's supposed to be good? Yeah, we were thinking about seeing that one. Who are you going with? Who's coming now? It's for me. Typical. We've just sat down for dinner when someone... How are you? -Fine. And you? Just fine. But... I can't do this now. You're not bailing out on me now. We decided. Are you sure? -Yes. Trust me. Maybe we should go to the movies. -What film? I don't know. Pass the sauce. This is so dry. Maybe it's a little overdone. I didn't want it bleeding. But you don't want to chew on leather either.
