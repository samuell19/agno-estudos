(horse trots) (distant church bell) (church bell tolls louder) (horse approaches) - Help us, Father, help us! - What about some food? - Father, they're starving us! - Are you staying, Father? (man cackles) This man's raving. Are you quite sure you wish to see him on your own? (heavy keys jangle) A visitor for you, Baron Frankenstein. If you need any assistance, I shall be outside. They told me you wanted to see me. Is it spiritual comfort you want, my son? Is that it? (Frankenstein) Keep your spiritual comfort for those who think they need it. I sent for you because I could think of nobody else. People trust you. They listen to what you tell them. Now, you listen to me. And when I've finished, you can pass it on to them. Then perhaps they'll believe me. - I have to tell you... - I'll tell you. You just listen. I'm sorry. If you think my word will carry any authority, you're mistaken. Perhaps you'd better not tell me what you think so important. - You'll stay. - Take your hands off me. - Tell me you'll stay. - Do you want me to call the guard? I apologise. Please, sit down. I said I apologise. I'll not forget myself again. As you wish. Unless I can convince you that what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth, then in one hour from now, I shall be dead. - I told you... - Then you'll understand. Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning. (chuckles) Where did it all begin? I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. That old fool who taught us may have hoodwinked the others, but what did he know? He'd been teaching the same rubbish for 30 years and I don't suppose he'd read a new book for 20 of those. When my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune. This enabled me to begin the life and the work I had always planned for myself. Victor, dear boy, you are the sole remaining member of the Frankenstein family. Now I know you will conduct yourself in a manner which would make your poor dear mother proud of you. I shall do my best, Uncle. Thank you. Thank you all for coming. Goodbye. What was it you wished to see me about, Aunt Sophie? It is a matter of some delicacy, Victor. I... Was it about the allowance my mother made you? - Oh... - I shall continue to pay it. You're a good boy, Victor. Your poor mother would be... - Yes, yes. - Elizabeth, thank your cousin. (Frankenstein) There's really no need. Come along, Elizabeth. Say thank you nicely. Thank you. She's a good girl. She'll grow into a fine woman one day. - I'm sure she will. - She'll make someone a good wife. Goodbye. Well, goodbye. Oh! - The first of the month your mother... - I understand perfectly. - I shall do the same. - Thank you. Good morning. Is this the home of the Frankenstein family? It is. I'm Paul Krempe. I have an appointment with Baron Frankenstein. You must be Victor. I'm going to be your tutor. So I understand. But surely it isn't settled yet. I thought that this was just an interview to decide whether you were suitable for the position. Well, yes, but I've had correspondence with the Baron and he seemed satisfied with my qualifications. That's right, he did. I expect he wanted to see what I look like. Yes, that must have been it. Well, will you tell your father that I'm here? My father is dead. - That's ridiculous. I had a letter... - He's been dead for ten years. It was I who advertised for a tutor. It was I who wrote to you. You're the Baron then, are you? And have been since I was five years old. And you want a tutor for your son? I thought it would save a lot of explanation by letter. A difficult thing at the best of times. I fail to see that the disclosure of the facts can make any difference. You were to be engaged as my tutor, subject to the Baron's approval. You will take up the position. You will be paid as arranged. By whom? By the Baron. Well, I'm quite rich. Now, do you still want the position? I should be honoured, Herr Baron. (Paul clicks his heels) My first opinion of Paul was soon confirmed. He turned out to be an admirable tutor. In two years I'd learned all he had to teach, but we went on together probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching, always searching, until, gradually, the great sweep of our research began to assume a single direction. And to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking. Then, one night, out of sight and sound of the rest of the house, our efforts were rewarded. (bubbling) (low hum) (crackling) (bubbling) Paul, it's alive. Paul! Paul, we've done it! (both laugh) Paul, we've done it! There seemed to be a lag between the cardiac reaction and the first visible signs of life. That'll be the time necessary for the heartbeats to circulate the bloodstream throughout the entire body. If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive, we'd have a living body with only the barest life spark present. Think what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery. We could save hundreds of lives. Reducing shock to a minimum, no loss of blood. Victor, the Medical Federation meets next month in Berne. Can we have our paper ready by then? We could. But we're not going to. But why not? The Federation doesn't meet again for a year. Why wait that long? We must wait, Paul. What we've done up to now is nothing. Nothing to what we will do. We've only just started. Just opened the door. Now is the time to go through that door and find what lies beyond it. Don't you see, Paul? We've discovered the source of life itself. We've have used it to restore a creature that was dead. This is a tremendous discovery, but we mustn't share it yet. We must move on to the next stage. We've restored life where life was extinct. It's no longer sufficient to bring the dead back to life. We must create from the beginning. We must build up our own creature, and build it up from nothing. From what? What on earth are you talking about? Forget the whole. Now we must take the parts: limbs, organs, and then we must build. Build what? The most complex thing known to man. Man himself. We must create a human being, a man with the perfect physique, with the hands of an artist and the matured brain of a genius. - We can do it. Don't you see? - No, I don't. What you're saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature. - Such a thing could only end in evil. - What's the matter with you? You haven't shown any scruples up to now. As for revolting against nature, haven't we done so and succeeded? Isn't the thing that's dead supposed to be dead for all time? Yet we brought it back to life. We hold in the palms of our hands such secrets that have never been dreamed of. Where nature puts up barriers to confine the scope of man, we've broken through those barriers. There's nothing to stop us. What is it you want to do? First we need the framework, the body. Last week they hanged a man at Ingolstadt, a highwayman. He'd been terrifying the countryside for months. As a warning to others, his body has been left on a gibbet just outside the town. It'll hang there till it rots. Or till it's stolen. (glasses clink) Whoa! (horse whinnies) Whoa! Whoa! Well, the birds didn't waste much time, did they? The eyes. Half the head's eaten away. What are you going to do? Take the head off. It's no use to me anyway. (fizzing) It's in the acid. A few minutes and there'll be no trace. Now, Paul, give me a hand with his clothes, will you? Just look at those hands. Great clodhopping things. No wonder he was a robber. With hands like those, he couldn't have been anything else. Except perhaps a gorilla. I don't think we should continue with this. We should wait and present our findings at the Federation. - Should anything go wrong with that... - I've got it. - What? - You look after things while I'm gone. Gone where? If I leave tonight I should get back by tomorrow evening. - Victor! - Yes, Paul, what is it? What are you talking about? Where are you going? Going? I'm going away for a while. I'll tell you about it when I get back. And, Paul, better not touch our friend while I'm gone. Let him rest in peace... while he can. Let's have some food. I'm hungry. I thought it was the master. No, he hasn't come back yet, Justine. Will he be in time for dinner, sir? I don't know, he didn't say. (knocking at door) There he is now, sir. (woman) Good evening, Baron Frankenstein is expecting me. May I come in? I shall need some assistance with my luggage. - Luggage? - Yes, I'm coming to stay. Well, I'm sorry, miss, but the Baron told no one of this. But he must have done. I wrote to him some weeks ago. Victor, how happy I am to see you. I'm afraid there's some mistake. Mistake? But didn't you get my letter? I'm not Victor. I'm Paul Krempe. Oh, Paul Krempe. I'm so sorry. It's just that, well, I haven't seen Victor for so long. Now that you know who I am, why not tell me who you are? I'm Elizabeth, Victor's cousin. Didn't he tell you about me? No, he did not, for which he will be severely reprimanded when he returns. Oh, he's away? Yes, but he's expected back any moment. So we shan't have long to wait. Are you going to stay with us long? I'm coming to live here. This is to be my home. - Live here? - (Frankenstein). Paul, I... Elizabeth. (Elizabeth) Victor. Well, Elizabeth. I received your letter. I was so sorry to hear about your mother. How are you? The maid will show you to your room. Paul, come and see what I've got. Elizabeth, we'll see you at dinner. - Yes, but... - Paul, come on. As he said, we will see you at dinner. (sighs) Lock the door, Paul. Come and look at these. (sighs deeply) What about these? Have you ever seen anything so beautiful? Bardello's hands. The hands of the world's greatest sculptor. - Where did you get them? - Leipzig. I heard that Bardello died there last week. - All it needed was a little bribery. - You realise what this means? It means that our friend will be reborn with the finest hands ever possessed by any man. I mean your cousin's arrival. We can't continue with this experiment. Not here. - What are you talking about? - Elizabeth. She might find out. What if she does? Where's the harm? She's young, Victor. Her mind would be incapable of receiving such a shock. Alright. You can't see the horror of what you're doing. At first I was blind to it. And now? When you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment. I hope I can convince you I'm right, change your mind, too. You'll never do that, Paul. In six months' time, you'll rejoice in the fact that you helped me present this achievement to the world. - You'll be as famous as I will be. - No, Victor. Infamous! I will not help you, not any more. I beseech you, give this thing up, if not for your own sake, for the sake of the girl. You're wasting your time, Paul. Help me graft these hands on. It'll be interesting to see if they take. Can't you understand? I will not help you any more. And I shall try and make Elizabeth leave here. Elizabeth won't leave, Paul. If you're really not going to help me, I'd be glad if you'd leave me alone. I have work to do. I shan't be down to dinner. Make my excuses to Elizabeth, will you? - Will you require anything else? - No, thank you, that'll be all. Very well, sir. I shall take the master's dinner up now. Leave it outside the door. Of course, Herr Krempe, I always do. Do you take your coffee black or white, Paul? Elizabeth, I don't know you very well but I want you to do something for me. Yes? - Leave here. - Leave? Yes, leave this house at once and never come back. But that's impossible. Why do you ask it? I can't explain but it... it will not be safe here. Not safe? - Victor will be here, won't he? - Oh, yes. Victor will be here. Then I fail to see... It is because of Victor I'm asking you to leave. He's conducting experiments which could be dangerous. What sort of experiments? - You wouldn't understand. - I would understand, I'm sure I would. Please tell me. Believe me, I can't tell you. I would if I could. Then I shall have to ask Victor. If I'm to marry him, I have a right to know. Marry? Of course, we're engaged. Didn't he tell you? How can you be engaged to someone you don't even know? It was an arrangement between Victor and my mother. That's absurd. You can't be expected to honour an arrangement of that sort. My mother and I were entirely dependent upon Victor. We'd have starved without him. Now perhaps you understand. I understand you're confusing gratitude with affection. You have no right to speak to me like that. How dare you? I'm sorry. It's entirely your own affair and nothing to do with me. Nevertheless, I think you should leave. Believe me, it's for your own good. Really, I can't imagine why you make this idiotic request. It is not a request. It's a demand. You must not stay here. Perhaps we should let Victor decide that. After all, it is his house. Or had you forgotten? No, I haven't forgotten. I'm sorry. Perhaps I shouldn't have spoken to you like this. I'm sorry, too. I lost my temper. Please forgive me. But really, Paul, just because it was arranged years ago, that's no reason for my not marrying Victor. It has always been my dearest wish. His, too. - Victor. - How many times must I...? - Baron then. Herr Baron. - That's better. How much longer is this to go on? Meeting like this in dark corridors, making love in secret. When are you going to marry me? What makes you so sure that I'll marry you? Because you promised. And because of this. Herr Baron Victor, this woman, what is she doing here? - Are you jealous? - No. Yes. Yes, I am jealous. She's not your mistress? - (laughs) - If I thought she was... On the contrary, Justine, she's to be your mistress. It'll be your duty to serve my cousin Elizabeth and see to her every need just as thoroughly as you have mine. - But in a different way, of course. - Of course. Victor, you're not going away again, are you? I'm afraid I must. But I'll be back tomorrow evening. Why, Elizabeth, what's the matter? It's just that I'm disappointed. I see so little of you these days. There are the household accounts to see. You should check them with me. They'll soon be your department. I'm sure you'll handle them admirably. But I'd like you to see them. I'd like your assistance. You'll be asking soon if you can help me with my experiments. But I would. I would like that more than anything in the world. Who knows, my dear? Perhaps you will. One day. And now I have to go. I have some materials to buy. Materials for my work. - (man coughs) - (Frankenstein) Well? - (man Here you are, sir. - Careful, man. (man) Not often we get 'em perfect in here, sir. (coughs) Eyes is generally the first to go. What do you think, sir? (Frankenstein) They'll do. (man coughs) (Frankenstein) Ten we said, didn't we? - (man) Each. - The pair. (man) The pair. Just like you said. (knocking at door) - Who is it? - Paul. I'm just coming. Come in, Paul. You wanted to see me? It's been a long time since you've been up here. Why is that? - You know you're always welcome. - I told you I would not help you. In that case why do you continue to live here? But of course, it's Elizabeth you're worrying about, isn't it? What is it you want? Haven't you found it difficult keeping away, just guessing what I was doing? Never knowing just how well I was getting on? Well, I've decided to let you see my progress. Then you can judge for yourself whether I shall succeed or not. I'm at the last stage but one. Come and see. - Well, what do you think of it? - It's horrible! Paul, the features are not important. What matters is I'm creating a being that will live and breathe! Once the scars on the face heal, it won't look so bad. Victor, I appeal to you. Stop what you're doing before it's too late. But what am I doing? I'm harming nobody. Just robbing a few graves. What doctor or scientist doesn't? How else are we to learn the complexities of the human animal? Doctors rob for the eventual good of mankind. This can... This can never end in anything but evil. Now, why do you say that? I admit he isn't a particularly good-looking specimen at present. One's facial character is built up by what lies behind it, in the brain. A benevolent mind, and the face assumes the patterns of benevolence. An evil mind, then an evil face. For this, the brain of a genius will be used. And when that brain starts to function within the frame, then the face and features will assume wisdom and understanding. I told you I was at the last stage but one, the brain. A brain of superior intellect. A lifetime of knowledge already behind it. Imagine that, Paul. My creature will be born with a lifetime of knowledge. Victor, where is this brain to come from? I'll get it. (laughter) - Now, Professor. - Dear, oh dear! Your hospitality is too generous, my dear Baron. On the contrary, Professor Bernstein, it is we who are in your debt. When Victor told me you accepted our invitation, I was overjoyed. (Bernstein) You honour me, Miss Elizabeth. Not only overjoyed because you were to stay with us but because your presence at dinner would ensure my Victor's presence. Elizabeth thinks I spend too much time in my laboratory. He's locked in his old laboratory for hours on end. He doesn't eat and he doesn't sleep. I, for one, think the world would be a far better place without research. At least, my world would be. She may be right, Baron. One can spend too much of one's life locked in stuffy rooms, seeking out obscure truths. Searching, researching, until one is too old to enjoy life. You see, Victor? The professor's on my side. You've failed me, Professor. Now Elizabeth will quote you every time she wants me to leave my work - and idle away the time with her. - Indeed you shall. I shall say, "Victor, you are only a little scientist." "I shall not listen to you." "On the authority of the greatest brain in Europe, you must leave your stuffy laboratory and come out into the sunshine with me." Women, Professor, you see? How cleverly they twist our words to suit their own ends. She'll only be happy if I give up my work entirely. Is the world ready for the revelation you scientists make? There's a great difference between knowing that a thing is so and knowing how to use that knowledge for the good of mankind. The trouble with us scientists is we quickly tire of our discoveries. We hand them over to people who are not ready for them, while we go off again into the darkness of ignorance, searching for other discoveries which will be mishandled in just the same way when the time comes. It's not as bad as that, surely? Would you have us give up research, too? Good evening. Paul, I'm so glad you arrived in time to meet Professor Bernstein. - Professor Bernstein? - Yes, indeed. May I introduce my friend Paul Krempe. - Good evening, sir. - How do you do, sir? The professor is staying with us tonight. I am indeed proud to meet you, sir. I had no idea such an honour awaited my return. We didn't expect you back until the morning, Paul. I thought it best to come back. I've heard a great deal about you from Baron Frankenstein. And I look forward to a talk with you in the morning. I shall be delighted, sir. - I feel we've exhausted the professor. - No, no, no, no, no. I have enjoyed every minute of this delightful evening. But old age comes not alone. Goodnight, young lady. Goodnight, Professor. I trust that you will sleep well. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight, sir. - I'll show you to your room. - Thank you. I really am most honoured to have you here, sir. I am most grateful to you, my boy. You know, I'm alone in the world. And to be a guest in someone's home, especially such a charming home like this with such a wonderful atmosphere, it's very precious to me. You are too kind, sir. I would like to show you a painting just before you retire. It's this one at the top of the staircase here. It was purchased by my father and illustrates one of the early operations. If you step back a little, you'll see it better. Look out, Professor! Look out! (bell tolls) Baron Frankenstein. I'm sure I'm expressing the feelings of all of us when I say how much we appreciate your kindness and consideration in allowing the body of our poor colleague to find its last resting place in your family vault. As you know, Professor Bernstein had no living relatives. It was the least I could do. He was a guest in my house. (hammering) (approaching footsteps) - (sighs deeply) - I thought I'd find you here. That was very intelligent of you. Now that you've found me, what do you want? You killed the old man, didn't you? And now you're mutilating his body. Mutilating? I've removed his brain. Mutilating has nothing to do with it. I can't prove you murdered him but I can stop you using his brain. Why? He has no further use for it. - Give me that! - Don't be a fool. Be careful! - You'll damage it! - (glass shatters) Get out! Get away from here and leave me alone! Get out of here! If you've damaged it... If you've damaged it...! (knocking at door) Who is it? What's the matter, Paul? I've come to appeal to you to leave here. - What are you talking about? Leave? - Now. This very minute. Before it's too late. Paul, we've been through all this before. Won't you understand you're in real danger? What Victor is doing is dangerous to everyone in the house. Then why do you stay here? You're not helping him any longer. I'll tell you why I stay here. I will not leave you alone in this house with him. Believe me, Paul. You're wrong about Victor. Am I? - You must be. - How do you know? Have you ever been in that laboratory of his? No. You cannot possibly conceive the dreadful thing he's proposing to do. What are you trying to tell me, Paul? That Victor is wicked, insane? Neither wicked nor insane. Just so dedicated to his work that he can't see the terrible consequences that could result. Elizabeth, I can't bear the thought of any harm to you. I'd do anything to avoid hurt to you both, but Victor is so wrapped up in his experiments that... Stop it, Paul, please. (sobs) Please leave me, Paul. (sighs) (thunder) (thunder) (bubbling) (loud bubbling) (thunder) (low hum) (crackling) (thunder) (thunder) (crackling stops) (low hum stops) (thunder) I want you to help me. You must be mad. That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself but... but I can't. I'm delighted. That means your experiment will not succeed. You're going to help me, Paul, whatever you say. (thunder) (thunder) (crackling and low hum resume) (thunder) If you help me, I promise once I've proved my theories, I'll dispose of this creature. - How long will that take? - A month, two at the outside. And have that thing alive up there all the time? No, Victor. If you don't help me, Paul, then I make no such promise. Somehow I'll manage on my own. However difficult, I'll do it. When I have succeeded, I'll introduce Elizabeth to the world of science. You'd never dare! There is nothing more important to me than the success of this experiment. It's what I've worked for all my life. Alright, Victor. I'll help you. (glass shatters) (gasps for breath) (gasping) Victor! (gasps) I did it, Paul. (Paul) This thing must be destroyed before it regains consciousness. Do you hear me, Victor? - What did you say? - You must destroy this thing now. Paul, don't you see? I've succeeded! Yes, nearly succeeded in getting yourself killed. - Another ten seconds... - This is my creation. Yes, a criminal lunatic! It tried to kill you. That's the brain. When you attacked me, it was damaged. That makes it your fault, Paul. Your fault it's not what I intended it to be. But I can repair the brain. It's what I've done that counts. I've created a being. - You promised to destroy it, Victor. - When I've carried out my research. Don't you see you've created a monster? That doesn't matter. I shall operate on the brain tomorrow. It shouldn't take long. Very well, Victor. Goodbye. (Frankenstein) Paul! Paul! - Paul, he's gone. - He's what? I've searched the house. Heaven knows where he's got to. It's true, Paul. We must get out and find him! - I'll go to the village for help. - No, I'll send word. We must pick up his trail before he gets too far. If he gets deep into the woods we'll never find him. I'll meet you downstairs. (birds twitter) (footsteps) Hold on, boy. You're going too fast for your old grandpa. You sit here then, Grandpa. - Where? - Here. I'll go on now. It's not far. Aye, thank you, boy. - Do be careful now. Go on. - Yes, Grandpa. (footsteps) That was quick. You can't have picked many. What's the matter? Can't you find your way? I'm here, son. I've lost my stick. Help me find it, son. You're quiet. Cat got your tongue? Who are you? Tell me who you are. What do you want with me? Can't you see I'm only a poor blind man? I've got nothing for you. I can't harm you. Somebody help me. Help me! (screams) Grandpa! Grandpa! Look, he must have stopped here. Where did you tell the villagers to make for? The south lakeshore. I said we'd meet in half an hour or when we spotted him. Well, his trail is easy to follow anyway. No, Paul! (gasps) You shoot well. I've done what had to be done. We'll bury him before the villagers arrive. They won't arrive. I didn't send the message. You madman! You risked just two of us against that? - We might've been killed. - We might. But we weren't. Now he's dead so it doesn't matter. Well, it's done and I hope you're satisfied. I'm satisfied we were in time to stop this monstrous act before it was too late, if that's what you mean. I don't think I shall ever forgive you for what you've done. Ever. (knocking at door) - Who's there? - It's me, Paul. Just a minute. Well? I'm leaving now. I shall send for my things in a few days. As you wish, Paul. Where are you going? What are you going to do? I have no idea. It's sufficient that it's no longer necessary for me to remain here. What do you mean, necessary? Of course, there's Elizabeth. You stayed to protect her. You've done what you set out to do. You can leave with a clear conscience. I'll give you life again. - Justine, you can serve dinner now. - Just a minute. Is it true? I beg your pardon? About you marrying that... that woman? - Aren't you forgetting yourself? - You promised to marry me. I'm not forgetting that. Yes, so I did. (chuckles) - Don't you laugh at me. - (chuckles) - Stop it! Stop it or I'll... - What? - What will you do? - I'll kill you. You stupid little fool! Did you really think I'd marry you? - You're hurting! - Get back to your work! But you've got to marry me. You've got to. I'm going to have a child. Since when is this? It doesn't matter. It's true, that's all. Why choose me as the father? Pick any man in the village. The chances are it'll be the right one. She won't think so. Not when I tell her. And I'll tell her what you're doing in that laboratory. And then I'll go to the authorities and tell them. Tell them what? Oh, I know plenty if I care to tell. - What do you know? - You wouldn't like that, would you? Well, if you don't marry me, I'll tell. Tell what? You know what I'm talking about. Proof, my dear. That's all the authorities would be interested in. Proof. I want you out of this house by tomorrow morning. I'll get proof. Just you see. I'll get it. (door creaks) (guinea pig squeaks) (faint noise) (whimpers) (screams) Pass the marmalade would you, Elizabeth? Thank you. - Victor? - Hm-hmm. I'm worried about Justine. It's a week since she went away and we've still had no word from her. I told you not to worry. I expect some village Lothario eloped with her. She always was a romantic little thing. How are the wedding invitations coming along? Had any replies yet? - Yes, quite a few. - Oh. - Victor. - Yes, Elizabeth? I've invited Paul to the wedding. After all, he was a very good friend of yours. I'm sorry if I've done wrongly. He hasn't accepted yet so maybe he won't come. I hope he does come. There's something I'd like him to see. (string quartet plays) To the bride and bridegroom. To the happy couple. - To the bridesmaids. - What are you gibbering about? I was just rehearsing my speech, my dear. Fool. That's not until tomorrow after the wedding. Yes, I know, my dear, but these things take time. - Come on. We're going home. - So soon? Come on. (sighs) Thank heavens they've gone. I've work to do upstairs. But, Victor, this is our wedding eve. I thought... Oh, come, Elizabeth. We are not sentimental young lovers. Can I come and watch you working in your laboratory? No, no, my dear. Not yet. But one day very soon. I promise you. It's a pity that Paul didn't come. Leave those till the morning, Ellen. Yes, Miss Elizabeth. (knocking at door) Good evening. I'm Herr Krempe. Are the Baron and Miss Elizabeth at home? - (Ellen) Yes, sir. - Paul! - Paul, how marvellous to see you! - Elizabeth. We thought you weren't coming. Why, you look wonderful. And Victor? He's in his laboratory. He's been almost living up there for the past few weeks. - What's he doing? - As if I should know. I'll never know what goes on behind that locked laboratory door. Of course, I forgot. But he'll be pleased to see you. He was saying only yesterday that he wished you were here because he has something he wants you to see. Has he? Why don't you go up and surprise him now? I will. (knocking at door) - Who's there? - Paul. Paul? Paul. Still keeping the door locked. Is that necessary? You can judge for yourself in a moment. Elizabeth said you had something to show me. Yes. Yes, Paul, I have. I've started on brain surgery, Paul. Nothing to say? - So it wasn't killed. - Oh, it was. At least, life had passed from its body. But don't forget, I was the one who put it there in the first place. It was comparatively easy to restore it. No, wait, Paul. I want to show you something else. - I've seen enough. - Wait, Paul! Watch this. Get up. Come on, get up. That's right. Now, come here. Come on, now. Come here! Sit. Sit down. Sit down! Is this your creature of superior intellect? Your perfect physical being, this animal? Ask it a question of advanced physics. It's got a brain with a lifetime of knowledge. It should find it simple. Shall I tell you something, Paul? There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine. Oh, yes. I gave him life. I put a brain in his head. But I chose a good brain, a brilliant one. But it was you who damaged it. You who put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault, Paul. Do you understand that? Your fault. Yes, I understand. But you won't win, Paul. And shall I tell you why you won't win? Because I shall carry on. If I can't cure it by brain surgery, then I'll get another brain. And another. And another. No, Victor! No, you will not! Paul! Paul, what are you going to do? Paul, what are you going to do? For your sake and to protect Elizabeth, I've so far kept silent. But now I shall go to the authorities and have them destroy that creature and see that you pay for these atrocities. No! Paul, where are you going? Paul! Paul, wait a minute! Paul! What are you going to gain by this? You're as much a part of it as I. I've had nothing to do with it for months. Listen! I've got something to say to you. (chains rattle) - (splash) - Who's there? I warn you, if you tell the authorities, Elizabeth will be the first to suffer. Victor! On the roof. We must get up there. Not this time. I'm going to the village for help. (stumbling footsteps) (Frankenstein) Elizabeth! Come back! (screams) Get back! Get back! No. No. Get away from me! (glass shatters) (screams) (fizzing) (Frankenstein) My life's work, destroyed. Destroyed in a moment. And by the same hand that gave it life. Within half an hour there was nothing left of him. And that is my story. That is what happened. You don't believe me, do you? You must believe me, do you hear? A visitor for you, Frankenstein. Herr Krempe. Will you see him? Oh, yes. Yes! I knew it! Paul wouldn't fail me. He'll tell you it's true. He knows. He'll tell you it's true! Alright, he'll see you. I knew Paul wouldn't fail me. He's been a good friend. He'll prove everything I said is true. He knows. Paul! Paul, my dear friend Paul! Paul. Paul. Paul, my friend, tell them, Paul. Tell them what, Victor? About him. About the creature I made. Tell them. You were the only person to see him apart from myself and Justine. The girl you murdered. But I didn't. That's what I've been saying. It was him. - He did it. - Who? Who did it, Victor? The creature I made! You know. The man. Tell them. Oh, no! No, Paul! No, Paul, you must tell them. You know what's going to happen. Only you can save me. You must tell them. Paul, I'll make you tell them! I'll make you! Paul! Paul, you must tell them! Paul! Paul, you must tell them. Paul! I'm sorry, Paul, but you must tell them. You must save me, Paul. Paul, you've got to save me! No! Paul! Paul! (sobs) Paul! There is nothing we can do for him now. Come on, I'll take you home.
