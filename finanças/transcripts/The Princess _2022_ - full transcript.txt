Tilt it. No, you've gotta hold it with your hand in there. Just to... Oh, the cap's on, silly! No, we're going through the Louvre. - You must go through the Louvre. - Where do we go? No, go straight, yeah. Go straight. Woo-hoo! Oh, mad, man! - Where do I go, guys? - Are you lost? Go straight ahead. Go straight ahead and don't have an accident. - Don't... - And then go left. Jamie, where are you? - Um. I'm in Paris... - Oh! Here we go! On the right, everyone is star-studded because something's happening. It's the Ritz. Wow, wow, wow! Guys, look at this! Someone's out... they're very important. Hey, hey! James, say something to Adelaide. Chasing Princess Diana. Lady Diana, morning dear. Morning. Is there any possibility of any announcement of your marriage in the near future, can you tell me? Can you tell me, uh, if there's any possibility? I'm not gonna say anything, I'm afraid. Oh, sorry! But Prince Charles did give us a hint himself. He said we wouldn't have to wait too long. Careful. He said we wouldn't have to wait too long. Was he completely off beam? - Was he? - Sorry, I... Was he completely off beam when he said, we wouldn't have to wait too long? I wouldn't know. Prince Charles says we all might know what's likely to happen between the two of you. Can you say if you're likely to make an announcement soon? Lady Diana! - Um... - Lady Diana? We thought there was gonna be an announcement on his 32nd birthday, but, uh, there wasn't. And he's told the reporters yesterday that it may be coming soon. Have you any comment to make about that? - No. - Lady Di? - No comment all round. - Mm... Did you have a good weekend though? I'm going to work now, okay? Your Royal highness, do you have any thoughts about the lady that the Prince of Wales should marry? You've got to remember that when you marry in my position, you're going to marry somebody who perhaps one day is going to become queen. And you've got to choose somebody very carefully, I think, who could fulfill this particular role, and it's got to be somebody pretty special. Could I ask you first, your Royal Highness and you, Lady Diana, what do you think you've got in common? Gracious, what a difficult question! What do you think we've got in common? A sense of humor. Um. Every outdoor activity, except I don't ride. - Um... - Soon remedy that. Lots of things, really. What about you, sir? Um. No, I think, certainly, I mean all sorts of things. And certainly the... a sort of a love of the outdoors and she's a very energetic character as well, which is which is very encouraging. And music and... and, uh, interests like that. Can you take us back to when you first met? If you can remember? Can you remember - when you first met? - Yes, yes. I certainly can. It was 1977. Prince Charles came to stay at a friend of my sister Sarah's for a shoot. And we sort of met in a ploughed field. I spoke to you previous to that... And what did you... What did you think then? What was your instant impression, both of you? What did you think about Lady Diana? Well, I remember thinking what a very jolly and amusing and... And attractive 16-year-old she was. And I mean great fun and bouncy and full of life and everything. And, um I don't know what you thought of me but... Pretty amazing. Do you find it a very daunting experience that yesterday, you were, uh, a nanny, and now you're about to, uh, marry the Prince of Wales and one day you would be queen? It's a tremendous change for someone of 19 to make all of a sudden. It is, but I've had a small run up to it all in the last six months. And, next to Prince Charles I know I can't go wrong. He's there with me. In the depths of a recession, the British now have some happy news and a great national event to look forward to. The Royal Family maybe an anachronism in the dismal 1980s but it's an anachronism the British dearly love. She is said to be besotted by him. "Sweet, kind, nice" and "shy" are all the terms used to describe her. And her father, her uncle, Lord Fermoy, and others have even vouched for her virginity. Lady Di, could you wave? Good luck, sir. It's good, it's great, innit? He's getting on a bit, innit About time he got married. The ladies did their thing for Ladies' Day as well as ever. The predominant color this year was red. And as if to prove the point, Lady Diana was wearing a red hat and that certainly was a winner. National Front is the White man's front! Join the National Front! Bastards! You're next in the queue for a Charles and a Di. Where are you going to have your tattoo put? Uh, on the other side of my leg. Well, this is the biggest thing since Farrah Fawcett Major. Yes, at times like this, Britain is at its very best. No matter what concerns us, like, having no money, no jobs and riots in the streets... We're doing our bit as a celebration to the regal pair. Our children are suffering! They are crying for help, nobody will listen. News of Lady Diana's visit spread quickly. The crowd saw that, like most brides, Lady Diana has lost weight as the day approaches. How many people in this audience think that the press ought to lay off the poor girl? That was about a 90 to one, I thought. Robert Lacey, do you think that Lady Diana yet fully realizes how tough life will be in the full public gaze? Well, I'm sure she does. I don't think there could have been a future consort who's been through anything like it. So, she's been through, in a way, the worst that can be thrown at her. Do you think it's going to be easier from now on? Oh, I think it's going to be much easier. I think we're going to see a change in the attitude of the press. Um. I think that now she's palpably one of the Royal Family, um, all this telephoto lens business will stop. - Clear back. - Stay back, lads. That'll do, thank you very much. I'm more used to it, I think, probably now... knowing for years that the cameras are poking at you from every quarter and recording every twitch you make. So, if you don't try to work out in your own mind, some kind of method for existing and surviving this kind of thing you... you would go mad, I think. And so, in the end, you do get used to it, but I don't know, do you find that after the last six months you're beginning to get used to it? Just. It is, I suppose, one of the most important things you're going to have to adjust to, - really, isn't it? - Of course, yes. The wedding has obviously meant a great deal of planning and preparation. A lot of work, I imagine, behind the scenes. How much have you become involved in that personally? Well, we both try to be very much involved. Have you been able to put in any small personal touches that will still make it very much your day? Um... Have we been able to put any small personal touches? I think by inviting one's friends and all the people who've helped us. Are you gonna have time for the private life? For making a home and running a home? I tend to lead sort of an idiotic existence of getting... Trying to get involved in too many things and dashing about. And this is going to be my problem, is trying to sort of control myself. And... and... and, you know, work out... something, so that we can have a proper family life. It isn't easy. There's so much to be done. Are you looking forward to... to... To making a home at Highgrove, for example. Oh, yes, very much so. Looking forward to being a good wife. At Buckingham palace, the crowds cheer at anything and everything that goes past them, from a policeman on horseback to a policeman on foot, to just a press photographer. Good morning, America, this is St Paul's Cathedral, the wedding will be held here. Lining the streets of London, two million well-wishers there waiting for the royal coaches. It's frequently said that this is the sort of pageantry and splendor that only Britain these days can do. Prince of Wales' escort, a smaller escort for church... This will be the first time for more than 300 years that the heir to the throne has married an English woman, and there seems little reason to doubt that this is an affair of the heart. No sign of the bride yet. For many people I think it will be one of the high spots for the day. They're just coming out of Clarence Gate. - Her dress is fabulous. - Is it her? Oh, no, you're joking! It's got a bloody roof on, you can't see her. Well, I want to thank you most sincerely about all that. If I'd have known that, I wouldn't have bothered to turn up. Greeting the bride as she's arrived here in the glass carriage. Her father, Earl Spencer has just COMMENTATOR 2 A taffeta dress and there's lace on the bodice... Ooh! - Oh, that's beautiful! - Beautiful! I love the garlands that the little girls have. She's wearing diamond drop earrings lent by her mother. - Do you want her shoes? - Yeah. I pronounce that they be man and wife together. We should all be allowed to wear wedding dresses and celebrate! I wanna see faces, not the back of fucking heads! I wanna see the flag, Davey! A little wider, Davey! Come on, come on, come on. Here is the stuff of which fairytales are made. The Prince and Princess on their wedding day. But fairytales usually end at this point with the simple phrase, "They lived happily ever after." Our faith sees the wedding day not as the place of arrival, but the place where the adventure really begins. The escort under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Parker-Bowles, there's the Royals, as Charles and Lady Diana stayed with him and his wife Camilla in Wiltshire on two occasions at the end of the year. So, they're among friends as they ride along the Mall. Your Royal Highness? Sir. Sir, please? Sir? - Hello, Tom. - Hello. - Yes. - Personally, I think, that this was nothing but a waste of time. Um. I think the money could have been spent a lot better elsewhere. I thought it was fantastic! Really great for the British image. What made it so special for you, Hettie? Well, to see all of them people. Yes, you weren't actually amongst them then? No, no, I was at home watching. Very sensible, I should think. It was pretty crowded out there, wasn't it? It was, but it was fantastic, marvelous! Proud to be British, my dear. It is with the greatest of pleasure that the Town Hall wishes to tell you that Buckingham Palace has just announced that the Princess of Wales is expecting a baby in June. Fant... Aw! We are sure you will join us in congratulating the Prince and Princess. Oh! Don't you think - it's happened a bit soon? - Well, I do really, yeah. I don't really think they've got to know each other - really, by now. - Well... But they obviously have. To the royal heir, male or female, I don't mind which, as long as the Royal Family continues. - Here's to them. - Here's to them, indeed. Cheers. Droves of photographers gathered at the hospital... As soon as it was announced Princess Diana had gone into the early stages of labor between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m. London time. Until the baby's born, all the royals' comings and goings are St Mary's. We're awaiting the historic announcement of the birth of the Royal child, who'll be second-in-line to the throne after Prince Charles. Strawberries and cream anybody? A boy or a girl? - Boy, definitely. - Why? 'Cause boys are the best. You're not a feminist then? No. No, let's have a girl. You want... You want a girl? Let's be fair, he's still got time to have some more, ain't he? You know? If the first one don't turn out right, he can always try again. Well, I'm hoping she won't keep us here all night. Would you like to see - a baby boy or a baby girl? - I would like her to have a boy, and I should think if she's having all this trouble, it's a boy. It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy! - Congratulations. - Thank you, very kind. Does he look like you, sir? Uh. No, he's lucky enough not to. How do you feel, sir? It's a bit difficult to tell at the moment. And how do you feel? Um. Obviously relieved and delighted. It's marvelous. They have been singing, "Well done, Charlie. Let's have another one!" Is that on the program of events do you think? Bloody hell, give us a chance! You ask my wife, I don't think she'd be too pleased just yet. May I ask you if you've seen the royal baby yet? Not yet, I left early this morning, you see. When are you hoping to see him? Oh, well, when I get back to London. When you get back to St. Mary's, yeah. When I get back, that's right. And Princess Anne's reaction in New Mexico. - Have you heard about Diana? - I don't know, you tell me. And your reaction to her having a son? I didn't know she'd had one. - This morning. - Well, good. I'd just like to propose a toast to Prince Charles, Princess Di and wee Willie and the Royal Family. Now, for all of our students on air today, good morning girls and boys. - Good morning. - Good morning. Jamie Smith out at Ayres Rock, you have a question. Does Prince William have a favorite toy? Does Prince William have a favorite toy? Um. Jamie, he loves his Koala bear he's got, but he hasn't got anything particular. He just likes something with a bit of noise. A plastic whale which throws things out of the top. Um, we got a plastic whale that throws things out the top, little balls. The couple circled the arena to the kind of reception normally reserved in this age group for pop stars. Both the media, and the public want to know about this couple, not so much Prince Charles. As a photographer said to me, you can't give pictures of him away, but Diana is very big news everywhere. Give us a wave. Am I in the way? We want Di! Princess Diana! Over here! Ladies and gentlemen, the last time I was here was two years ago, uh, in 1981 shortly before we were married. And, at that time, everybody was saying, "Good luck and... I hope everything goes well, and how lucky you are to be engaged to such a lovely lady." And my goodness, I was lucky enough to marry her. And we had many, many messages... The prince realizes now that he's taking second place. He knows it's the princess people have come to see. - They chanted for her... - We want the princess! And cheered again when the prince chose her direction. And I've come to the conclusion that really it would have been far easier to have had two wives... To have covered both sides of the street... And I could've walked down the middle directing the operation. REPORTER 1:30 years ago, you wouldn't dare go up to a member of royalty, but people are encouraged by her... her presence and by her... her happiness, and the fact that she's so good with people to just go up and say hello. Three cheers for Lady Di! - Hip-hip. - Hooray! - Hip-hip. - Hooray! Charles doesn't like the fact that she's a superstar and he isn't. What has happened is there's been a transformation. She has become the person that everyone wants to know, everyone wants to meet. He has taken the back seat and it's not enjoyable for him. The Princess of Wales has been the best thing to happen to the Monarchy in... In... probably in centuries. I mean, she has gone to Australia which is now 50/50 republican 50 percent monarchist, and she's turned that into 80 percent in favor of the Royal Family. Now, that's a major achievement. It's not Prince Charles, who's been out there before and made little influence. It's the Princess of Wales that's made the influence. You have a family here that is used to being the people that everybody turned out in their thousands to see on the streets. And then suddenly, Diana's the one that everybody wants to see. How do you think he feels about his wife today? Well, of course, one shouldn't forget that Charles and Diana got married for the single purpose of having a child to secure the succession for Charles's family. To begin with, it was a marriage of convenience. Go and have a look, have a look through there. You can see all those people at the other side. Look through there. You see, you can see people on the other side. Can you see their faces? The people in there. Look at them Trapped. Now, you both like skiing, and yet every year it has become a regular, you don't appear to hit it off exactly eye-to-eye on the slopes. I suspect most husbands and wives find that, uh, they often have arguments. - But we don't. - No, no, no. Well, occasionally we do because I mean... - No, we don't. - I'm... you know, I. I go on longer, sometimes. Yes, but I'm faster. There we are. Ma'am! Ma'am, this way please! Ma'am! Ma'am. What do you say, ma'am, when you read in the papers that you are a "determined domineering woman"? I don't always read that. Um, people are very willing to tell me that, but I don't think I am. I'm affectious with myself, but not necessarily with everybody else. Get right back. Come on, fellas, make some room. We've gotta move out of here. Can you, please? Ma'am, can we... There is a natural and continuing interest in you. For example, have you actually tried to change Prince Charles in any way since you got married? Not at all. I mean, obviously there are one or two things, like, maybe the the odd tie or something. But nothing... - Shoes. - Shoes, we won't go any further. But that... but... nothing dramatic. I mean he's... At the entrance to Kensington Palace, the prince and princess and their baby arrive from the hospital at speed and swept in without stopping. Then less than an hour later, Prince Charles left to play polo. Something most new fathers would hardly dare to suggest. He has always carried on, ever since he got married as if he were a bachelor. He's made absolutely, and he never did from the word go, almost any concession at all to being a married man with the responsibilities of a wife and now, two children. What do you feel your role is? I feel my role is supporting my husband, um, whenever I can and always being behind him, encouraging and also, most important thing, being a mother and a wife. And that's what I try to achieve whether I do is another thing, but I do try. But you are developing your own interests and your own specialization? Yes, but that's taking time because I don't want to dive into something without being able to follow it up. It's nice to see you in the flesh. - In the flesh? - Hmm. Don't look too near, you might get a shock. I've seen enough photos of you. I know, there's too many of those. Sold them in the shop downstairs. - How much do you sell them for? - Three pounds ten that one's going for. Is that all? What about the three fifteen? - I don't, I don't, I don't... - Should I choose something there? Oh look, Charles Dew, let's grab that one. - I don't... - There you are. Eleven forty, it's very apt, my husband, right? Yeah, I know. Diana demonstrated her ability to make royal conversations last a little longer than the "Where do you come from? How long have you been here?" type. Did you get a chance to see her? - Yes. - Yes. The Princess of Wales has opened Britain's first purpose-built AIDS ward and met the 12 patients who are being treated there. I love the red glasses! What a lovely woman! She's incredible. - She's so natural. - She is, she's totally natural. Yes, yes. Just like somebody walking in Diana has got the common touch, she can sit down, she can talk to anybody, whoever they are. I agree. But I don't think the public expect the Queen to go to hospices and kiss AIDS patients. It would nice if she did though, wouldn't it? I don't think that people expect that of her. But you would like a Queen that actually could talk to ordinary people. She doesn't have the common touch in the same way. - That's why Diana's so special. - Well, she can't! Because she wasn't brought up to that. She spontaneously and unrehearsed, of her own volition picked up a little boy who has AIDS and hugged him. Staff told the princess they were surprised that she'd come to Harlem Hospital, a place never visited by any American president and few major political leaders. Nancy and I are deeply honored to welcome the prince and the Princess of Wales to the White House. John, are you going to dance with the Princess tonight? If she'd like me to. At his first press conference, he wanted to talk about the exhibition, but they wanted to ask about her. She'd be an idiot if she didn't enjoy dancing with John Travolta, wouldn't she? How many of you manage to reply on behalf on your wives on these occasions? I'm not a glove puppet so I can't answer for that I'm afraid. A state of rather cool indifference has settled over this marriage and the one problem that we were all aware was there from the start, the 12-year age gap really has begun to tell. Prince Charles, instead of going to his home at Highgrove in Gloucestershire, and talking to his plants and his trees, he should be at home, and he should be talking to his wife. How do we even know they're sulking? What proof have we got? It's all paper supposition, surely? It's the media that's causing the problems and the reporters. - The snoopers. - Leave them alone. The thing is if... if married couples have an argument, the best thing to do, shove 'em off in a room on their own and let them sort it out. Not everybody else trying to do it for 'em. The couple had spent a month apart when they reunited to visit Welsh flood victims. I think it must be dreadful for the two of them, they are going around doing their duties side by side, carrying out an engagement and they're just not even acknowledging the other person's presence. She does one thing on her own, he does another, and they just don't meet physically, mentally, or emotionally. - Okay, rolling. - Do you get the Taj Mahal in? Yeah, rolling. The Prince and Princess of Wales will spend today as they've spent much of this royal tour, apart. He will concentrate on issues such as housing benefit schemes and industry investment. She will concentrate on the welfare of the Indian people. How did this fairy-tale princess end up in this way? In my humble opinion, it's because the institution of the Monarchy makes demands on people. We simply cannot be satisfied in the world in which we live. Hello! Hello! When you put a modern person in an ancient institution, they will be destroyed. Anyone would be destroyed. But once an institution starts destroying people, it's time to recognize that there is something fundamentally wrong with that institution and not with the people it destroys. Oh, yeah. A very what, Your Royal Highness? In what way? No more questions, guys. Oh, lovely! This week, a sensational new book has exposed dramatic insights into the private life of the royal couple. Shocking revelations of a hollow and tormented marriage are giving the British media and it's public little else to talk about. According to Morton, Princess Diana's suicide attempts which included throwing herself down a flight of stairs when she was three-months pregnant and slashing her wrists with a razor blade were a desperate cry for help and attention from her husband, Prince Charles. Slashed her wrists with a razor blade, cut herself with a lemon slicer and a pen knife, and yet, I've never seen any scars in any photos. And I just find it very strange to think that this girl has tried to commit suicide, unsuccessfully five times and wants it to be publicized. I find that very difficult to... to believe. Especially... she's a mother too, she's got young children who are gonna be affected by this. The author insisted today that close friends of the princess stand by the integrity of the book. He came on ITN's lunchtime news to make his first live defense of the claims on television. Mr. Morton, this book is called Diana: Her True Story. It's not her story, is it? It's what you say unnamed friends told you. That's rather different, isn't it? I think that the reason why this book is authentic is because many of her closest friends have spoken to me on the record, and more than that, they've stood by their statements. Nevertheless, unlike other journalists, you don't really have to check your facts that thoroughly, do you? Miss Junor, doesn't the silence of Buckingham Palace and the absence of even a single lawsuit give evidence to the idea that perhaps Mr. Morton was telling the truth? No. I think they all recognize that the princess is ill, she has bulimia. The Palace know about it, Prince Charles knows about it. He knows that this is the result of a sick mind. She has said some terrible things about her husband, she's accused him of being a bad husband, a bad father, and carrying on an all but adulterous affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. You do say in the book though that Diana and Charles have separate bedrooms. Yes, they have separate bedrooms at Highgrove, they have... essentially have separate lives and they have done for some time now. Now, what about the bracelet? Well, this is a bracelet that Diana discovered at Buckingham Palace, a gift that Prince Charles bought for Camilla. It was inscribed F and G, Fred and Gladys, the two nicknames which they use for each other. And I think there's a teeny point, that actually the GF stands for Girl Friday which is his secret pet nickname for Camilla. - And, uh... - Louise, Louise, I think... I think really it should be Girl Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Buckingham Palace officials have denied once again today that the Princess of Wales cooperated in any way with the book and refuses to dignify its claims with any further comments. But the repercussions are continuing. Diana! How do you think you would have behaved if you'd been a 19-year-old girl who was... - Difficult to imagine but go on. - Seduced as you were in the best sense of the word, by a 32-year-old man, the future King of England who doesn't love you, didn't wanna marry you, has another woman who he's really in love with. And it's surprising that that young girl - suddenly had a whole series of problems? - The great... Wouldn't you in that circumstance? If You wanna be like me you've gotta suffer. Oh, Squidgy. Yeah, you have to. - And then you get what you... - You get what you want? No, get what you deserve. Oh, God! "Hear the tapes for yourself." The Sun has been inviting its readers, more than 120,000 have done just that. I don't wanna get pregnant. Darling, that's not gonna happen. Oh, Squidgy. I love you, love you, love you, love you. You're just the nicest person in the whole wide world. A tape recording of a highly personal telephone call reporting to be between the Princess of Wales and a friend, James Gilbey, was given to The Sun newspaper by a retired bank manager. He makes my life real, real torture, I've decided. It was only a matter of time before the tabloids printed what's been circulating in private for days. The full transcript of an alleged conversation between the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Did we hear the tape of the conversation between him and Camilla Bowles-Parker? Did you hear that? I did. I was very shocked by it. Ooh... I want to feel my way along you. All over you, and up and down you, in and out! Oh, Charles! The tapes are frankly filthy. They're disgusting. I wouldn't allow my daughter, whose 15, to read them. I'll just live inside your trousers or something. It'd be much easier. But the real hypocrisy is pretending that there is any other reason for producing the contents of these tapes than to sell newspapers. What are you going to turn into? A pair of knickers? Or God forbid a Tampax! There has been no comment from Mrs. Parker-Bowles... Yes! In the past, her husband has dismissed such allegations - as rubbish. - I have nothing to say. So, you're wasting your time here. Thank you. Prince Charles was doing his best to look as if personal problems were the last thing on his mind and he avoided all questions about the Camilla gate tapes. Today, there was no comment at all, but the two tapes together have further tarnished the couple's image. Do not let in daylight upon magic. I think we've got an unhealthy obsession with the Royal Family. The Monarchy now is in danger of being glared out of existence by too much publicity. That was the moment that told everybody that she hated him. Is this a marriage which has now gone badly wrong? There can be no doubt about that. Is this a couple that can barely be together, be seen together, they can't even act out a public charade? Do you think she's happy in her marriage at the moment? - Yes, I do. - Oh, do you? She'll be very pleased to hear that, I'm sure. There was a picture of her, yesterday... - Yeah. - In The Sun or whatever it was saying, "Diana looking miserable and lonely laying a wreath." How the hell do you want her to look laying a wreath? You find a miserable shot and you put a caption that suits your witch hunt. I promise you, we're not on a witch hunt. I would love to write nice things about this particular marriage. So, when are they gonna get the time to actually do that, to sort out their marriage if they're not going to get any privacy? This marriage is finished, it's a great shame, a great shame, but we are reporting... No way is this marriage finished. Don't you think that we love our Prince and Princess, our Queen, respected all over the country, the world? Yeah, well said. I feel it's the papers, the tabloids. If they let them alone, every marriage has its problems. There is something wrong in the internal workings of that family that creates such a problem as this. It's not the press' fault, the press are there to print news and it is news. 1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis. In the aftermath of Friday's tragic fire at Windsor, it is especially so. Statement of Prime Minister. With, uh, permission, Madam Speaker, I wish to inform the House that Buckingham Palace are, at this moment, issuing the following statement. "It is announced with regret the Prince and Princess of Wales have decided to separate. Their Royal Highnesses have no plans to divorce, and their constitutional positions are unaffected. Her Majesty and His Royal Highness particularly hope that the intrusions into the privacy "of the prince and princess may now cease." Hear, hear. Sir? - Sir... - No questions please, you've had your announcement. The Prince of Wales, it now appears, didn't actually marry the first woman he fell in love with, Camilla Parker-Bowles, but seems to have felt that he had to, by some sort of obligation, choose, um, a woman who had not had any previous partners and was clearly seen as a very suitable catch. Unfortunately, we no longer live in an era where once you've got married it's an arranged marriage and that's that. I mean, we live in 1992. I suspect there's been this terrible problem, really. And it stems really right back to the upbringing of... of the royal children. I was relaxed and calm and I thought... It was gonna be a long... Come on! I thought it was gonna be a long day. Mamma mia, get out the way. It's just a matter of getting there, you know, I'd rather be there than hanging around here. Everyone says, "Is the loon out today?" Or "Is the loon..." "Is she having a loony lunch?" or something like that. It's just a... a term of endearment, really. The cops are working out how they can get her out without us taking a picture. Here we go. She's rich enough to have a gym of her own. In my two-bedroom flat in Peckham, I've got my exercise bike in the front room. You can't tell me a woman on hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, with a house as big as hers can't have her own gymnasium. - I think... - She likes to be with people. - She likes to be bloody well watched. - Well, she wants to... I feel like I know them. I feel like I know Princess Anne, - Fergie, all of them. - Yeah? Because we see so much of them on the television. And I like it. I want to know all the ins, the outs and I love it. All we do is take pictures. The decision to buy the pictures is taken by the picture editors of the world and they buy the pictures so their readers can see them. So, at the end of the day the buck stops with the readers. Turn that off! Are you filming us? - Yeah. - Turn that off. Oh, sorry. Are you on the lift, David? One day she'll use the media for her own advantages, and she'll, uh, give you a nice picture. And the next day she will have a bag over her head, you know, so, we're never sure what way she's gonna react. I can't fucking see her. Is she in the queue? There she is, back of the queue. Which one is she? Can you see her? There. Oh, I see her. That's not her. Yes, it is. She's about three behind it, she's got her head fuckin' in between her... Oh, fucking hell! What is she doing? Where? I can't see her. Don't worry boys, not yet. They said she's been laughing and joking? Yeah, she's been smiling, joking. She skied right up in front of a French photographer, laid down in the snow in front of him and said, "Is that... is that too close for any of the 5mm lens?" So... so, she's playing games with 'em, you know. For fuck's sake, stay still! - Excuse me. - Bloody hell! She's spotted us. No, she hasn't. It's just cause we're looking at her. Can you just imagine how small we... Fuck! The Royal Family decided 15-20 years ago that they had to be more populist. They brought the cameras in, they encouraged examination of themselves by the media. You can't turn the paparazzi on and off as they're trying to do. Take the lift. This way. Ma'am, can we just have one more, it'll take two seconds, please. - No! - Please. Absolutely not! You've behaved so badly. - Diana, just one picture! - Yes? One, huh? Just give me one picture, mate, and I'll go, all right? - No! Out! Out! - Out! Out! Out! Out! O-U-T! Out! Have a nice trip, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, her Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales would like to make a short statement. Ladies and gentlemen, when I started my public life 12 years ago. The media might be interested in what I did... but I was not aware of how overwhelming that attention would become nor the extent to which it would affect both my public duties and my personal life. When I've completed my diary of official engagements, I will be reducing the extent of the public life I've led so far. Over the next few months, I will be seeking a more suitable way of combining a meaningful public role with hopefully, a more private life. My first priority will continue to be our children, William and Harry. To the wider public, may I say your kindness and affection has carried me through some of the most difficult periods and always, your love and care has eased that journey. And for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. It's very Diana, isn't it? To call a press conference to announce that she wanted to be left alone. - Absolutely in character. - Yes. She has done untold damage to the Royal Family, I bet you she'll be back. She'll do a song and dance act to get back on the front pages. And I think she's very close to being a monster. This is the story of the Prince of Wales today. What he does, what he thinks, what he believes, what he feels. This afternoon the heavyweight royal correspondents from the national newspapers are viewing the program for themselves. The Mirror's James Whittaker thinks the film will do. Prince Charles no good at all. The best thing that can happen is for the Queen to live for a very long time. Well, it's going to be very interesting to see precisely what Prince Charles does say. And it's also, of course, going to be very interesting to see how his rebuilding of his public image is going to work. Program maker Jonathan Dimbleby was giving nothing away. It appears to have stirred up quite a fuss and you'll have a chance to see it and then you'll be able to judge for yourself. The most damaging charge that is made in relation to your marriage is that you were, because of your relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles, from the beginning, persistently unfaithful to your wife and thus caused the breakdown. What is your... your response to that persistent criticism? Oh, that's the persistent criticism, is it? Mrs. Parker-Bowles is a great friend of mine. She has been a friend for a very long time and will continue to be a friend for a very long time. When marriages break down, awful and miserable as that is, it is your friends who are the most important and helpful and understanding and encouraging, otherwise you would go stark raving mad. Did you try to be faithful and honorable to your wife, when you took on a vow of marriage? Yes, absolutely. - And you were? - Yes. Until it became... irretrievably broken down. Us both having tried. This is supposedly our next king who is behaving like a spoilt child. Diana, she's been pushed from the word go and she has been humiliated and it... it's just disgraceful. Princess Diana, who declined to take part in the program was tonight attending a charity dinner while her husband spoke of their past and future to millions. It's a funny old world, isn't it? Camilla dresses up like this to please her man and Di does it to piss him off. And what's poor old Charles supposed to do? For years, the papers were after him to own up to a little rumpy-pumpy, and now they're after him for doing it. Prince Charles was the man who committed the adultery... - Lies, lies, lies. - And I'm not party to Diana first, she had an affair with her bodyguard. She is the wronged party as far as I'm concerned. Do we know that? Do we know that? I know. It's a fact. Oh, it's a fact... And let her deny it if she dares. I hope you're indemnified for libel. While Palace officials are anxious not to crow about success, they clearly feel that their man has withstood well the ordeal of trial by television, that the gamble, so far at least, has paid off. It is 14.99 for 'em. Fourteen ninety-nine? The book that has catapulted the Princess back into the headlines arrived in the shops this morning, after a weekend of intense speculation about its contents. Written in the breathless style of a romantic novel, it purports to be an account of an affair the Princess is alleged to have had with a former cavalry officer, James Hewitt. Do you think there's anything in what Major Hewitt is saying? He seems to be just relying on... on one factor to try and sell the book, that he may or may not have slept with Diana. Take your photograph and then go. Are you doing any deals with newspapers - because obviously your opportunity's... - No, no deals. Could you say where this was filmed? I have no comment. No comment, I'm afraid. Not any time at all? If you are royalty, the rocks you're throwing weigh a couple of pounds a piece and you can find them at your neighborhood bookseller. Last week came an authorized biography of Prince Charles. In it, we learn the prince was pushed into marrying Diana and that Charles has had a love affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles on and off for more than 20 years. If they want to have affairs, if they want to make it public, fine. - But I can't see what the problem is. - No, no, no. That's ridiculous, you can't expect to have the to have a Monarchy that's full of magic and they should be washing their dirty linen in public. They can't have it both ways. - They've always had dirty linen. - Thank you very much. Thank you. This couple are conducting their marital squabbles in the most extraordinary way, in public via the tabloid newspapers they profess to hate. It's become a tactical square dance, a row in front of the neighbors, 60 million neighbors in this country alone. Where do you see all of this leading because there... there's been such saturation, uh, of this material, some of it sleezy, some of it perhaps just sad. But, uh, but surely there is a desensitizing process going on and one wonders in the end at what point British people throw their hands up and say, "Enough, enough! I just don't wanna hear any more." I think what's happened is that, functionally, the Royal Family has through misjudgment and ineptitude, and a fair degree of stupidity, turned itself into something of a of a branch of the entertainment industry, and I'm not sure they're ever going to recover from it. I think they're... they're doomed to continue. Ma'am! Ma'am! Your Royal Highness, how prepared were you for the pressures that came with marrying into the Royal Family? At the age of 19. You always think you're prepared for everything. This was the moment. Britain had been waiting for and they packed the pubs, just as they did for the royal wedding 15 years ago. Millions of televisions in millions of homes were tuned in. Princess Diana in her own words. And with a husband who was having a relationship with somebody else? A husband who loved someone else, yes. You really thought that? I didn't think that, I knew it. Do you think Mrs. Parker-Bowles was a factor in the breakdown of your marriage? Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded. She talked openly about having post-natal depression, about suffering from bulimia for more than three years and about the self-inflicted injuries to her arms and legs. She says she only wanted to put her side of the story. Is the House of Windsor so flimsy, it can be shaken by a single interview? Did your relationship with James Hewitt go beyond a close friendship? - Yes, it did, yes. - Were you unfaithful? Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. Astonishing. Refreshment was needed to help us take it all in. At 10:41 the national grid recorded a 1,000-megawatt surge. 300,000 kettles were being switched on, at least 15 million viewers were busy brewing. Even more remarkable, Newsnight on BBC 2 more used to an audience of around 800,000 found themselves with eight million. In an astonishingly frank interview, in which she admitted adultery and bulimia, Diana told millions of viewers of attempts by Buckingham Palace to intercept her mail and blacken her name. Do you really believe that a campaign - was being waged against you? - Yes, I did. Absolutely, yeah. Why? I was, uh, separated wife of the Prince of Wales, I was a problem, full stop. Never happened before, what do we do with her? Can't we pack her off to somewhere quietly rather than campaign against her? She won't go quietly, that's the problem. I'll fight till the end because I believe that I have a role to fulfill, and I've got two children to bring up. Did you know how miserable she was? No, she was very... She was very good at not showing it. - Mm-hmm. - And then when we... Well, when I was there, living there, I sort of, uh, got to know more and more - about it. - The pain. The pain she was in. Yeah. Most people don't understand if you have all that stuff, why don't you just behave yourself, do what you're told and just play the game and go along with the program? - You could do that. - Mm-hmm. You could do that and then... and, and if that's what suits you, that's what suits you. But I'm afraid for Diana and I, we learn, we're like rivers, we wanna learn more, we wanna go round the next corner. Do you think you will ever be queen? Why do you think that? I don't think many people would want me to be queen, actually. When I say many people, I mean the establishment that I'm married into because they've decided that I'm a nonstarter. And why do you think they've decided that? Because I do things differently. Do you think the Monarchy needs to adapt and to change in order to survive? I understand that change is frightening for people, especially if there's nothing to go to, it's best to stay where you are. I understand that. But I do think that there are a few things that could change, that would alleviate this doubt, and sometimes, complicated relationship between Monarchy and public, I think they could walk hand in hand as opposed to being so distant. By the time she left a glitzy charity ball in London tonight, many were questioning what exactly prompted the princess to grant such an explosive interview to the BBC. As well as admitting adultery, Diana pulled apart her failed marriage and questioned her husband's suitability to be king. What's your verdict on that interview last night? It's light entertainment. I mean, we've sent Neighbours over here, we've sent Home and Away over here, you give us Diana's interview back. I was particularly incensed about her children, and she wants to be close to her boys and she'll teach them how to throw up so that they don't have to do what they want to. She'll teach them how to stamp their tiny feet, she'll teach them to lie, she'll teach them to manipulate their friends so that the world gets their side of the story. What do you think about the fact she did the interview in the first place? I think it was wrong. I think that... I think that... what Charles did as well was wrong when he'd done his one, but I think it's just... It shouldn't have happened. You know? I think that should be... kept private. I thought she was stunning. I think it's... I think she's probably devastated the Royal Family, Absolutely. Simply because she's just stripped away the mystique and that's what they're based on. I lost all respect for the Royal Family after watching that last night. To do that to a beautiful woman and take no notice of her cries for help or whatever she's going through, I thought it was just... disgusting. Charles, I've got no respect for that man at all now. I think it would be fair to say that at this time as a result of the occurrences over the course of the past several months, that we could now be witnessing the end of the Monarchy and the reigning queen could possibly be the last. Hear, hear. The Monarchy rules by favor of the people, and the moment the Monarchy loses that, it is finished. And the Queen knows it. This is the time of year for greetings to be sent between family members, but the world's most famous Christmas card, it seems, was sent by the Queen of England to her son Prince Charles and his estranged wife, Diana. "Enough already" it said. "Stop this unseemly bickering. Get divorced!" Can you tell us any of the content, sir? No, no. I'm not commenting on that. There is a... there is a statement which is being faxed to the Press Association but it's not going to be read out. - Hold them out... - No, no, no. Can you come out? Can you come out? Come right out, please. Come right out. Close the door. Come on out. We can't see you there, close the door. Hang on, hang on. You wouldn't care to read it, would you? No, I'm afraid not. It would help us greatly if you could. Thank you very much. Maybe a name and address, please? Good morning, ma'am! It's quite clear to me that. Diana's had a very miserable time within this marriage and that she was somebody, especially, given the problems of her own childhood, her mother as it were, walking out on her when she was only six, a sense of betrayal and abandonment all her life. She genuinely wanted a happy marriage. And, uh, it seems that within that family it's very difficult to have one. And so, the world's most famous dysfunctional family now launches the world's most famous divorce proceedings. There shouldn't be much fight over the record collection, their tastes in that are different too, but there are the royal houses, the royal castles, the royal silver, and of course, the royal children to consider. Ma'am, are you pleased with the settlement? Grim-faced but 17 million pounds richer after her divorce deal. She will have to give up being HRH, Her Royal Highness. She'll be Diana, Princess of Wales. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? That's what I mean with her. She did have it on. She did have the ring on. - Did she have the ring on? - Are you certain, Paul? Are you certain? She looked beautiful, but I noticed she was wearing a lot of makeup. I don't imagine for one moment that he will marry Camilla Parker-Bowles... Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? I think the most remarkable thing was that she was not only wearing her engagement ring, but also her wedding ring. She was making a statement today which reiterates what she said before, "I never wanted a divorce." How can we possibly accept. Charles's succession to the throne, especially, as head of nation and head of the church when he obviously entered a marriage of convenience to produce an heir and continually maintained an adulterous relationship throughout that marriage? This has been the start of a debate and that genie is not gonna be put back in the bottle until at least there are fundamental changes in the way the present institution of the Monarchy is run in this country. If the Monarchy wants to survive then it will have to change. Officer, can you move? - Got enough cameras, Colin? - Two, yes. Fully loaded. The Princess of Wales has made it quite clear that she has no intention of going away. She wants to continue public life, and the important thing now is that her role should be defined. She woke me up. I love her. Oh! You've moved rooms! You've moved rooms. Just in here, she's moved rooms. - How are you? - I've moved three times. Good. Good work. Genuinely associating oneself with good voluntary causes. That I think is the sort of direction that the Princess of Wales sees herself moving in. She has 20, 30, 40 years of active public life ahead of her. So, the people who think of this as the end of something, misunderstand it, it's just the beginning of something. - Open the door, huh? - Are we in here? Well, I've got to come back. Thanks for having us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Excuse me! No, no, no, that would be treason, you know. Her coming here and launching this fund means we have a chance of collecting 25 million dollars. It gives us public relationing profile. We were able to, because of her, invite the top donors in this country, which we wouldn't have got normally. She's got everything that she's asked for. I think she courts the press, the media and I feel as long as she gets her daily fix with the media and the press, she's happy. You're looking at the scene outside Christie's this evening. The charity auction of dresses direct from the closet of the Princess of Wales. Diana, Princess of Wales has arrived in Angola to lend her support to the Red Cross campaign to ban landmines. Millions of mines were laid during Angola's long civil war. Thousands of civilians are suffering the consequences. May I hold? What's she feeding this young man? Oh, he weighs a ton. How long has she been waiting for a prothesis? She has been waiting for about three years. Will you ask her where the mine was? Yeah, she was trying to get some food with her mother when she stepped on a landmine. And... don't her friends help her? I understand they don't help. Sarim, can we ask him to smile too? Otherwise, I'm gonna be most upset. We have the best people working. I'd have thought that was the most important question out of the two, I'd go for that one. - Thank you. - Okay. No, no, I mean the one saying - I'm not a political figure. - Yes, exactly. I'm ready. The government will be announcing later today that we will ban the import, export, transfer and manufacture of anti-personnel landmines. Diana! Hey, Diana! She was named Humanitarian of the Year in America and mixed with that nation's most powerful and influential figures. This is one of the nicest British invasions that the White House has ever had. And it's because she is a woman who has had a tireless commitment to the homeless, to AIDS, cancer, leprosy, and other health issues. It is humbling to know that some of you feel that I should be honored in this way. I cannot think of a single heterosexual male of my acquaintance who wouldn't fancy Princess Diana... - But we're looking towards... - physically, at least. Yes, we're looking towards the ideal for her. I think she'd have great difficulty because, she's been so spiteful to Charles which would put some men off. And she needs so much. Just look at Jackie Kennedy, fo... it wasn't a happy marriage, but she married the richest guy in the world. Diana needs a billionaire on her lifestyle. Charlie! Is that her? The Saint-Tropez villa of Diana's friend Mohammed Al Fayed, in full view of waiting press and TV cameras the princess went to the beach beside it today. She seemed unconcerned by all the attention. There is still the question tonight why nobody seemingly advised the princess against accepting hospitality from a man who arguably helped bring down the last Tory government. Revelations about Princess Diana's continuing involvement with the family who own the Harrods department store is bound to have her critics again questioning her judgement. This is not the kind of man, with all respect to Dodi, that one would have envisaged the mother of the future king of this country, uh, walking out with. People look down upon us around the world, outside and say, you know, "Egyptians are... What are the Egyptians?" It's just a poor country," but that's not true. We have power and we're gonna go back to where we were before, and the proof is in the pudding. Di is dating Dodi Fayed and I think it's great. She wants this romance on the record and this is a story that's gonna run and run until something wonderful or something ghastly happens. Tonight, a Sunday newspaper's preparing its pages with what it describes as intimate photographs of the Princess and Dodi Al Fayed, it's reported to have paid nearly a quarter of a million pounds for the pictures. Yes, there's a kiss. Yes, there's a tender embrace, but this is a woman who suddenly doesn't care, uh, suddenly wants to shout from the rooftops, you know, "I'm in love and this is the bloke I'm in love with." This is a quite different situation. But she didn't know she was being photographed though, did she? The Princess of Wales is the most aware person in the world when it comes to photographers. We are here today to announce the filing of a lawsuit this morning in LA County Superior Court on behalf of Kelly Fisher against Dodi Fayed. Until a week ago, Ms. Fisher, of Malibu, California was engaged to Mr. Fayed and publicly wore his ring. Ms. Fisher learnt about Mr. Fayed's betrayal not from Mr. Fayed, but instead from the kiss photo that was published and circulated around the world to Ms. Fisher's utter dismay, shock and shame. This is the engagement ring. Hold it up right. Would she consider a reconciliation if it's only a friendship? - No. - No is her answer. If you could say something to Princess Diana today, what would that be? I'd like to tell her that, uh, sometimes the things that seem too good to be true, are probably too good to be true. These are Jeffrey's cards... Do you wanna see my cards? - Whose turn is first? - We're having a swell time although Princess Diana has been injured gravely it's been reported allegedly. Not allegedly, they have pictures. - We're watching it on... we're watching it on CNN. - "Allegedly." As the world awaits word on the fate of Princess Diana, the Princess of Wales seriously injured in a car accident hours ago in Paris along with companion Dodi Al Fayed who apparently was killed in that accident. There's still no concrete word on exactly what the condition of the Princess is, But I've just been told that a French eyewitness at the scene said that he thought that Diana had walked away from this, uh, uh, crash. Because she said she. It's breaking news. - So, who's winning? - It's the news, bro. Well, Alan's ahead right now. - Oh, I didn't just say that. - Alan's only got 68. - That's good. - Clark's next with 88. Police have arrested at least seven so-called paparazzi who were allegedly chasing the car at very high speed... They just keep breaking the news over and over again. At the scene of the crash, one eyewitness says that within five seconds of the crash there was a photographer taking pictures of what had happened and the scenario that has been, uh, painted is of, uh, a car which was being driven too fast in an attempt to get away from a photographer. You know, that could be the most photographed car... Gosh. It is. The engine is pushed - way back into the... - Yeah. They have to be dead. They're lucky anybody's alive. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Well... - Princess Diana dead! - Oh, she died. - Where's the remote? Oh, my God. You're in the briefing room where you're gathered, How did you find out? Who told you? Oh. - Uh, so... - Oh, God! I had to step out because it was still going on. Get it loud. We were told by a... a hospital, uh, employee making a public statement and uh, now the French Interior Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, is speaking and expressing his condolences. Can you hear me? It appears to be official. Princess Diana at the age of 36 has died of massive internal injuries she, uh, suffered in a car accident along with her companion Dodi Al Fayed. Let's go now live to CNN's Jim Bitter man in Paris. Jim. Are these for the palace? Here he is. Our thoughts and prayers are with Princess Diana's family, in particular, her two sons, the two boys. Our hearts go out to them. We are today a nation, in Britain, in a state of shock. Oh, Jesus. Don't even know why we're here, what we're doing here. Didn't think we... They was that important to us, you know. But there you are. You are telling people, "Get a life." Well, in fact haven't they gotten a life? Well, they've got no choice but to get a life. She's not coming back. We can get on without her, right? It wasn't such a big deal. Um, and many, many people, are, I... I think now, also now, are not afraid to say that she didn't mean that much. You don't know what you're talking about. You shouldn't even be in these gardens, now, you denigrate Diana and her image, you should not be here. I shouldn't be in these gardens? Who the hell are you? - Because the people... people that have respect for Diana... - Look, I think you're about as smart as you look. You see what... You see what brain rot... You see what brain rot descends on people. Unbelievable. They've taken her life! I'm sorry! I blame The Sun newspaper - and their ilk! - You're wrong. It's you, the press that killed her. You're the scum! Yes. You're here to pick the bones! The Times, Mail or The Sun? I'll take one of each. One of each? One pound twenty-three, love. - Yes, please. - The Mail and The Sun. Our queen should be here in London with her people. This is her nation, and they should know how all her people feel about Diana. Everybody loved Diana. Just typical reaction of the Royal Family. Stick to protocol. Don't worry about human emotion. I think it's time we stop talking about them and talked about ourselves, and what's wrong with us as a country that this Royal Family should apparently mean so much to us. People are showing their grief in this way, because they want to show the Royal Family that they feel that she was badly treated by them. That they just can't sweep her under the carpet. This incident is gross idolatry. It is vulgar, it is garish, it's excessive. And quite frankly, I think that the public is on a flight of fantasy. We share our grief with our English and Canadian friends. One can already sense these scenes beginning to atone for the hurt that there's been this week. People grieving need to target their anger at somebody and royal protocol got in the way. But royal protocol is being swept aside en masse today and it may be the best thing that could happen to the Monarchy. Ma'am, take care of the boys. - Take care of the boys, ma'am. - That's what we've been doing. - Sorry? - That's what we've been doing. I know you have. God bless you! William! God bless you, William! God bless you, young man. Thank you. We love you! We loved your mother! Diana! We love you! We love you, Diana! Oh, my Diana! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
