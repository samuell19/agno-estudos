Eins, zwei... Arei - Fantastic! - You okay? I've always wanted to do that. And shooting down that icy tube at over 70 miles an hour with up to three g's of pressure on your body... Is, uh, a real thrill. It's a fast, rough, scary ride. It's the degree that the olympic athlete is willing to sacrifice his fear, that he's able to achieve that moment of perfection just below disaster... And win a gold, silver or bronze. The winter Olympics, the most dramatic, exciting championship in the whole spectrum of sport. A racing driver loses his nerve, he can pull over to the side. A matador gets scared of the bull, he can jump over the fence. Even a downhill racer can stop if he wants to. But a ski jumper... He makes his commitment at the bottom of this tower. And once he starts his run, there ain't no turning back. This is the point of no return. The starting platform for the 90-meter olympic ski jump. It's where the jumper's moment of truth begins. Once he enters this icy passage and starts his exhilarating run... Each jumper wants to fly forever. And it's not his will or speed that stops him. But in less than 15 seconds, gravity brings him down. Here's where they come back to earth. Anything beyond that hundred-meter Mark, you have a chance of winning a medal. And it's steep. But if it were less steep, it'd be like a fly hitting a car windshield. If my desire to fly... Were greater than my fear of falling... I'd love to try this. And so to all you brave, young heroes... Who come to use this icy catapult to fly for your nation's honor... I wish you well. Good flights and happy landings. But I know your secrets. Yours is not a jump for glory. It's a jump for joy. # Searching for gold # # Searching for gold # You ready, sepp? Feel all right? Now the helmet? Yeah. All right. Am I ready now? - Yeah, you're ready now. - I just need my stick and five guys to hit. Hey! Gonna beat the red. We are the yellow one, the best one. Best team. Tonight, eh? Okay. I approve of that. And this is the slowest position in the fastest game in team sports, I'm the goalie, and my job is to keep this five and a half ounces of vulcanized rubber called a puck out of this goal mouth that's six foot wide and four foot high. And although it seems like I'm protected with all of this gear, when you see those forwards coming down at you... With their flashing blades and sticks flying... You know why. Hey, it's dangerous! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I've fantasized a lot about what it would be like to be the man behind the mask in an ice hockey game, and now that I've experienced the reality of it, I have a better understanding of what... What he goes through. You need incredible eyesight... Instinctive reflexes and a hell of a lot of guts to be good at that job. That's Danny gritsch. He's the goalie for the Austrian olympic team. Let's watch him work now. This game is played with six players per team on the ice at any one time. - Hey! - Hey! Two defensemen, a goalie and three forwards. It's broken up into three periods of 20 minutes each... With two ten-minute rest periods in between, which you really need, believe me. Come on! Let's see a little action out there! Shoot! Shoot! Yeah! These olympic players love to play this game. They love the feeling of skating over smooth ice, blasting that puck 90 miles an hour into a goalie. The sheer aggression of the body checking. For them, it's very much a game to play. For me, it's very much a game to watch. Yeah! Austria's journey to qualify for the final rounds of the Olympics starts with a tough one, the Russians. At the focal point of the Soviet attack is Danny Gritsch, the man I stood in for in that very same goal mouth during olympic training. It's the toughest evening of Danny's life. The Russians take on nation after nation. They're never in any danger until their last game, a game that unexpectedly turns against them from the outset. Russia's opponents? Czechoslovakia. A team well-prepared for this olympic final and passionately committed to beating the Soviet union. This will be a fierce conflict. Ice hockey laced with drama, emotion and, above all, aggression. The first Russian goal comes 12 minutes into the second period. It's a vital goal that brings the Soviet union back into the game after being two goals down. Come on, Czechoslovakia! The Russian equalizer comes at a bad time for Czechoslovakia. Less than three minutes before the end of the second period. Their confidence regained, the Soviet union will now be hard to beat. Nine minutes from time, the Czechs Pierce the Russian defense and find their Mark through Eduard Novak. In the 54th minute, a foul forces novak into the penalty box. It's a deadly blow for Czechoslovakia. One minute later, the Russians equalize. There are less than five minutes left to play. The score, 3-3. The Soviet union capitalized on their advantage, leaving the Czechs no time to recover. Twenty-four seconds later, Russia scores the winner. Their final assault is staged to perfection. Now, this is the two-man bobsled. It's the sporty cars of bobsledding. And we're about to go down this five-million-dollar computer-controlled, refrigerated tube in under 60 seconds. - Okay? - Okay. One, two... Three, four. Well, they say that steering one of these things is where it's really at in bobsledding. We're gonna find out right now. Well, fortunately, I've got one of the best brakemen in the business. He's a former Austrian silver medal winner... For the two-man Bob. Missed that one a little bit. Here we go. Down, down. A quick one now! And to the right. Into the carousel. Bring it in. Bring it in. Now out. Control. A right-hander. Heading down into the end of the groove, shooting down now. Two quick bends. Go into a fast right hand. Uh, down into the chute. Into the chute. On. Well, that's truly where it's at. That's a great run. We'll have to do that more often, man. Hey, thank you, man. Okay? So that's the two-man Bob. What about the luge? I didn't know what luging was before coming to Austria. But ironically, here in the Austrian tirol, it's older than skiing. In 1964, it was admitted as part of the olympic program. Let's go see what's it's like, shall we? And that's the luge. You didn't really think that was me, did you? Innsbruck, 1976. The first games in which the east Germans compete in the bobsled and luge. They sweep to victory after victory, winning all five gold medals. The established teams from Switzerland, Italy and west Germany are left trailing. No other nation features in Austria with such total mastery of one sport. East Germany's is a remarkable olympic debut. That group of five targets down there is 150 meters away. Not a great distance for a fully balanced and sighted rifle. Even I got four out of five. But then I haven't just completed two and a half kilometers of competitive cross-country skiing. That's the basis of the biathlon, a rigorous contest on snow requiring the eyesight of a hawk and the durability of a marathon runner. It combines a high degree of skill in two otherwise unrelated sports: Shooting... And skiing. More than any other winter sport... Cross-country skiing evolved from a way of life. The country people in Norway, Sweden, Finland, even Russia found that the most efficient way of getting around during the winter months was simply to ski. The rifle was added by the forester, the hunter. It became a popular form of sport... And by 1960 was admitted into the Olympics as a popular contest. The biathlete arrives at the shooting zone and has eight rounds in which to hit five targets. If he doesn't succeed in eight shots, he's compelled to ski a penalty circuit in an area just behind the shooting zone. The first shooting bout is in a prone position, with small targets. The second, in a standing position shooting at larger targets. The biathlon is a sport of contrasts. The body is driven to the point of exhaustion, as with a long-distance runner, and then must immediately relax to accommodate the requirements of a marksman. It's a unique sport in this respect. Now, I skied less than a thousand meters before I tried shooting. I got one out of five. After two and a half kilometers, I'm afraid I'd be skiing that penalty circuit all day long. To attain olympic standards, the biathlete must develop the control and concentration of a marksman and reach the peak physical condition of a cross-country skier. Deep, steady breathing. Harmonious coordination of movement. And the will to compete beyond his pain barrier. Then bring these two activities together under the pressures of olympic competition. The biathlon. Fifteen nations pull away at the start of the biathlon relay. Each team is comprised of four men. Although the speed, endurance and accuracy of individual competitors is vital, team consistency will win the gold medal. The Soviet union win their sixth cross-country medal of these games. But the real contest is for the bronze medal. After almost two hours of close-fought competition, the fourth and final skiers of the east and west German teams, Manfred Geyer and Claus Gehrke, sprint for home. At the finish, east Germany take the bronze medal by less than four seconds. As with the long-distance runner, the biathlete strives to reach beyond the limit of his own endurance to find success. Pain is often his only reward. American teenagers tai babilonia and Randy Gardner come to Austria in search of a medal. Less than half a point will separate them from a bronze. Where they falter in the eyes of the judges, they shine in the hearts of the public, projecting in their skating a youthful charm and freshness. Irina rodnina and Alexander Zaitsev of Russia, four years undisputed champions of world pairs figure skating. Theirs is not a program blessed with youthful charm, but instead, technical supremacy with precision timing and explosive movement. Rodnina and Zaitsev remind one that figure skating is, foremost, an exacting physical sport and not theatrical entertainment. It is this quality of supreme athletic prowess and technical skill that takes Rodnina and Zaitsev to an olympic gold medal and establishes rodnina as the most successful pairs figure skater of any generation. I'm preparing this pair of 220 downhill racing skis with a specially formulated secret mixture of waxes that'll give you up to a tenth of a second more speed in your downhill times. You see, all the olympic downhillers have their own passionately guarded secret formulas for waxing, hoping that it's going to give them the edge for each condition of the snow. For instance... The red for new snow. The gold for sunny days or rainy days. And the silver... for silver days. That's my secret. Now we're going up to the top of patscherkofel mountain. It's the site of the 1976 men's downhill, the most prestigious and glamorous event in the whole winter Olympics. The run starts just short of 6,000 feet above sea level and is quite a challenge to the racer. It's steep and very fast. And the man that wins the gold on this mountain will not only be olympic champion, he'll receive more adulation and publicity than all the other medalists combined. When a young athlete comes here from some other part of the world, how does he learn this patscherkofel course? Well, Jim, first of all, he has to memorize the course. He goes from one spot to another, memorize the turns and the curves and also the bumps and jumps until the finish. - Slowly? - Very slowly. That he gets it in his head like a tape, like a movie. So, when you're in the starting gate, you're rerunning this movie? Well, yes, before you're starting it already, you rerun it once, twice or three times, if you're not sure about certain turns or certain jumps. Is it as fast as other courses? Well, I think it is around... Uh, an average speed of 65 to 70 miles. - Sixty-five to 75 miles an hour? - Yes. Ooh! How's the wax, Karl? Well, we are talking about that secret later, okay? Karl Schranz, two times world cup winner, three times champion of the world. He was hitting over 60 miles an hour coming down this slope. And it's quick on skis. But this year's olympic champion will have to be doing better than that. Finf, vier, drei, zwo, eins. Los. Each downhill racer has just one run against the clock, one chance to win a medal. The rewards are high. Victory in the men's downhill can represent instant recognition, guaranteed acclaim. Bernhard Russi of Switzerland wants only a gold medal. He's already olympic champion, and no man has ever won two olympic downhill titles. Victory on the patscherkofel would place Russi alongside Schranz, Toni Sailer and Jean-Claude Killy, the downhill immortals. Finf, vier, drei, zwo, eins. Los. Franz Klammer is the young lion... The new sensation of downhill racing, the challenger every other racer wants to beat, russi's rival for supremacy. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba! Ba, ba. Ooh! The winner of the men's downhill is, for many, the ultimate olympic champion. He should be tall, dashing, fearless. And if the Olympics are held in Innsbruck, be Austrian. Franz Klammer is all these things. Because success rests on that vital one run, the downhill racer is always riding a razor's edge. His fear is not of falling, but of failing. Nothing illustrates this better than the last left-hand turn on the patscherkofel. Franz Klammer holds it together and goes on to become olympic champion, possibly a ski legend. Philippe Roux of Switzerland just manages to hold it together before running out of snow. Anton Steiner of Austria overreaches and stretches that fine line between success and failure too far and wipes out completely. It will be another four years before the next winter Olympics. This is Rosi Mittermaier of west Germany winning the ladies' slalom. She also captured the downhill and ran second in the giant slalom. In just five days of competition in Austria, Rosi Mittermaier is a triple medal winner. Only the Olympics can create a sports legend so quickly... So dramatically. In Delphi, when the oracle was there, the leaders of the world would stop the wars and stage the games because their ideal was epitomized in the glorification of the olympic hero. Here in Innsbruck, in these winter Olympics, the men and women who projected themselves beyond their capabilities and, alone, before the eyes of the world, attained that moment of perfection... Can truly be called champions of the world. Jo These heroic achievements stand to inspire athletes of this generation and the next and the next. Each winter Olympics produces a higher standard of competition, and the quality of performance grows. And with it grows the individual. # Searching for gold # # Searching for gold #
