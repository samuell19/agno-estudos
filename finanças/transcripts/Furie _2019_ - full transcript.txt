It's the fourth time you failed your quota. Can you handle it? If you can't, I'll have another take care of it. -Ut Det. Come here. -Yes, ma'am. See him? I can do it. -Just kidding. Take a hike, cripple. -Yes, ma'am. That damn Bay Thot, he really talked you up. What did he say? What did you do in Saigon? Took money protection at a restaurant? Hustled at a bar? You came here, you can't even get a job done collecting a few bucks from big farmers? Give me my pay. I'll get the rest tomorrow. Still asking for payment while you work like shit. There. It's yours. Take it. Be on time tomorrow. Hurry up. What are you looking at? Hey, you dog, what are you doing? Sell your house and compensate me. What are you looking at me for? You little piece of... -What are you buying? -The usual, miss. Pork, same as usual? Mai looks so grown-up these days. That's 30,000 dongs. That woman is so weird. Let her be, just the way she is. Where did she come from anyway? She came here alone, raised her kid by herself. No one knows who the dad is. Oh, my God. She is a bitch. A bitch can never find a husband. Don't say it. We are not in her shoes. I kind of feel sorry for her. Please, I'll pay you later. Listen, in this market, without me, you won't be able to earn anything. -When will you give me money? -I'll pay you when I have money. I'll give you one more day. If you can't make it, get lost. Hey! Where do you think you are going? Guys, search her bag. Give me your bag. Dump everything out. Nothing in here. -Hit her, guys. -Get her. Take this! Hit her. Beat her up. Who do you think you are? You bastard. You bastard child. -Am I right, guys? -Mai. What are you doing, little punks? Why don't you go home after school? What are you doing here? You dumb hustler. You debt collector. What are you gonna do to me? You little shit. -Are you okay, Mai? -Yes, I am. Can't believe these kids. A bunch of devils. You went to collect debt again? Nope. Your hand is injured. -Are you okay? -I'm fine. FISH FARMING PLAN The rice is burnt. Mom, the rice is burnt. Are you okay, Mom? Be careful. What are you doing here? Go do your homework. Let me take care of it. Hurry up! Here. Here. It's your favorite. Mom. I don't think it is done. Needs a little more cooking. Eat it anyway. Here. Where did you buy it? What? I didn't buy it. I cooked it. You little show-off. Done your homework yet? You will take exams this year. Even if I haven't done my homework, you think I can ask for your help? Eat, Mom. I'll tell you something. Hai Phuong! You bitch! Come out here! Where are you? Come out here! I'll break your legs! My brother, he just owes you some money, and you broke his legs! I dare you to come out here! I'll fucking break you! Where are you? Come out here. Come out! Where are you? You bitch. Come out here! You are hiding. Fine. When I come back, I'll burn your house down. Bitch. Hey. Be brave. Even if you are scared, you still have to be brave. Because being scared won't help you. It's just a feeling. That man back there, he's real. So, you can't be scared, okay? Let's go eat. Let's eat. Braised fish with pineapple? Let's try some of this. Pretty good. I picked it up at An Binh Island. Why were you there? You skipped class? Mom, yesterday was Sunday. You don't ever finish your homework, always out playing somewhere. You wanna end up being like me? Where did you get money from for fish? Aunt Sau Luc gave me some. She said you let her debt go a few times. Her house was so worthless. Nothing worth a damn for me to take. Keep it if she gave it to you. Mom. She wants me to watch her raft. -"Chap ba." -What's that? She wants me to patch her fish net. Plus... If I have two million to buy fish fries, she'll make a fish cage. I can use her boat, -I can make five million dongs per month. -Okay, young lady. Do me a favor and focus on studying. Keep talking about "chap ba." Did she cast a spell on you? But I am fed up with studying. They keep hitting and cursing me. That "You bastard!" "You debt collector!" I've heard it enough, and I'm getting an earache. Mom, let's farm fish. I don't need to go to school. I'll help you. I don't mind hard work. As long as you stop hustling, stop collecting debts, I can deal with anything. Look at yourself. How many days do you think you'd last? Why do you care, as long as I can afford your school? I don't wanna live off of debt collecting. Brush your teeth before bed! Boss. You should see a doctor right away. Or else you will have to get an abortion. Those dogs out there, they are only afraid of you, Hai Phuong. Cheers. Sau Banh. Rules are: If you're game, then stick around. If you can't play fair, get lost. Remember my face, Hai Phuong! What are you doing? Let me go. Let me go! Nothing to see, guys. Everything is fine. Hey, let's start spinning. Any sacrifice is painful. It's what we sacrifice for that matters. 10:00 AM - CAN THO CITY You really did some tricks to get this pair of earrings, didn't you? You can pawn it for one million dongs, interest is 350,000 dongs. Thank you, sir. -I need two million. -Go to Saigon, then. How do you think you can get two million for this trash? I'm old, I'm not stupid. If you are so strapped for cash, why do you wanna pawn it so bad? It's for Mai to start a fish farm. Let me think about it. This stone is of the lowest quality. The smaller ones, what can I do with them? -Eat them with rice? -Mom! I caught a thief, everyone. Hey, what are you doing? -She's just a kid. -She's a thief. Here, look. Here's the proof. You can't deny it. Mai, where did you get the wallet? I picked it up on the ground. So convenient for you? It's mine. There, see? Lucky me, everything is still here. You're just a kid and you steal already? It's how your teacher taught you to act? -See that? -Mai, tell me? Did you steal it? No, I didn't. I picked it up. You have to trust me. You have to trust me. See, guys? Don't ever feel sorry for these hustlers. Here. Check her pockets, see if there's anything else. -Give it back to her. -That's right Teach her how to behave. Or else bring her to the police. Yeah, that's right. -What kind of mother are you? -If it were me, I'd call the cops. Take her to the police. So stubborn she won't even admit it. Should be ashamed of herself. Mai, show me your pocket. No, I didn't steal it. Why don't you trust me, you trust these strangers? I hate you! Mai. This kid even talks back to her mom. She's young to be so disrespectful. See if she took anything. Wait. You think you're so smart? I brought that wallet and went to buy some wine. Didn't know I'd dropped it. Mai picked it up for me. Before I got a chance to say anything... -You're drunk, go home. -I'm not drunk. Turns out we've been wrong about that kid. Hey, one million dongs and a half, okay? I'm really doing you a favor here. Honestly, I would never give anyone else this price. So tough to do business in this market. I'll write you the receipt. Hey, kid. -I'm not pawning it. -What? Maybe I should move to Saigon. Mai. -Let me go. -Mai. Let's go play. Let me go. Let me go. -I don't wanna go. -Mai. -I know your parents. -Let me go. Mai! Mai! Stop! Stop! Mom! -Mai. -Let's go. -Get them. -Stop! -Stop! Stop the boat! -Kidnappers! Mom! Hey! Thief! Thief! Stop! Give me my child! Stop! Stop! Give me back my kid! -Stop! -Mom! Get off me! Mom! I'm sorry. Where the hell did she come from? Which way to the river? That way. Thank you. Sorry. Mai! Stop! You bitch! Where did they take my kid to? Say it! Hello, did you see a little girl in a green shirt with two men? No, I didn't. Sis, did you see a little girl in a green shirt with two men? No, I didn't see them. Mai, where are you? Miss, did you see a little girl in a green shirt with two men? Mai. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop the car! Stop! Stop! Miss, they've taken my child. Do you know where that bus is going? I'm not sure, but they all seem to head for Saigon. There are others going to Saigon. That's right. You should ask them. Sir. -Is this bus going to Saigon? -Nope, Ca Mau, grandma. Stop! You wanna die? Go somewhere else to do it. No. Are you going to Saigon? Can I get a lift? This is a cargo truck, not for passengers. Go away. No, please. Sir! Please! She's so stubborn. A tough one, too. It's okay. Mom, let's farm fish. I'll help you. I can take it. I'm fed up with studying. They only hit me and curse me. Who do you think you are? You bastard child! Bastard! I'm starting to get an earache. No, I didn't steal it. Why do you trust these strangers? Trust me. I don't want to live off of debt collecting. I hate you! 6:00 PM - SAIGON Hey, we're in Saigon. Thank you. Boss, Hai Phuong is here to see you. Hai Phuong? What hole did you just crawl out of? Mai was kidnapped. Get Hung Lua to ask around... He's been in jail for a while. Drink it up. It's been a decade. I'm not your bitch anymore. If your kid is kidnapped, go report it to the police. You got straw for brains, and now forget all the rules? Plus, I'm the boss now. I gotta take care of my own people. Help me this time, -as soon as I know, I'll leave. -Listen. Nam Ro gang took over the bridge area. Ton Dan area belongs to Thanh Soi now. Thanh Soi? -Who is she? -She's only been here for six years. Rumor says she's connected to all the big names, in Cambodia, China... She went up the ranks the moment she got here. She even threatened Nam Ro. Do you know why she's called Thanh Soi? She's both mean and smart. Please go back to your country-girl life. Or I'll be dragged into your mess. Born on November 30th, 2008, in Chau Thanh ward, Hoa An town, Cau Ke district, Vinh Long province. Slow down. Le Huynh Thi Mai. Carry on. -Born on November 30th, 2008, in... -Slow down, sis. It's dangerous if I get wrong details, as police will get the wrong person. But every second might cost my child's life. You know that? You need to remain calm. I have to be clear, so Boss Luong can look for your kid. Look. Don't worry. My boss is very decorated. You probably remember the Saigon-Hai Phong drug case in 2009? My boss Luong solved that one on his own. Right after graduation, he volunteered to be an investigator. And in only a few years, solved several major cases. Then he became lead detective. Not to mention smaller cases like murder and robbery. He can close any case. So be assured we'll find Le Hyunh Thi Mai very soon. Do you have any pain medicine? No. Are you really in pain? Let me go get some for you. Thank you. Stay right here. MISSING CHILDREN CHILD ABDUCTORS ARRESTED POLICE INVESTIGATES FAKE ABDUCTIONS CRITICAL CASES PENDING SURVEILLANCE SUSPECT CASE FILES This case involves the whole operation. They are very intelligent and organized. Give me more time, sir. If we made a move on them now, we'd wake a sleeping dog. I understand. But we need to put a stop to the ring to assure people. I will follow this closely, and will report to you soon. Don't worry. Hello, sir. There was a girl kidnapped in Tra Vinh. Her mom is in the waiting room. The girl's age fits the case we are working on. The mother looks really stressed out. Have you eaten? I'll call GrabFood for you. She was just right here. Where could she have gone? Tell me everything she told you. Yes, sir. PERSONAL INFORMATION Mai. Mai? -Hey! -I'm sorry. Anyone home? Open the door. -Anyone home? -Hang on. -Who are you looking for? -I'm looking for Nguyen Chanh Truc. It's urgent. He hasn't been here in a while. Go away. Hey, what are you doing? I told you, he doesn't live here. Please, go somewhere else. No, I need to talk to him urgently. Tell him to come out. -What are you doing? -My daughter was kidnapped. -I want to know where they're taking her. -I don't know. -Truc, wherever you are, come out. -He's not home. You should go. -I'll call the police. -Let me ask him. I'll leave right away. I don't know. Go away. Go upstairs, Mom. I'll handle this. Truc, why did you come down here? Go back upstairs. Go away. Who are you? What do you want? Who are they? Where did they take my daughter? That's none of my business. Only you would know where she is. Tell me. My son doesn't know anything. Go away, please. Go away. My son is clean now. Why don't you people trust him? Go away. -Truc. -Get out of my way. Mom. Oh, my God. Truc. Stop. Stop it! Truc. My son. Where's my child? Just leave me in peace. No, God! Truc. Please. You're gonna kill her. Stop. Stop! Stop, Truc. Mom! Say it. Where's my daughter? Truc. Just say it. Truc, tell her. Tell her. How can I survive if something happens to you? Please, son. Please, lady. Please, I beg you. You only have a few hours. There are operating rooms in the trucks, once they reach the train yard, you'll never see the kids again. In Ton Dan area... there's a five-liter empty can hanging in front of a shop. I don't know which of the six trains are leaving tonight, but they must stop at Song Than at 2 a.m. Then they move to trucks at the Quy Nhon port. Hey, watch where you're going. What do you want? -A drink. -It's 10,000 dongs. Seems like we only see each other late at night. What did you come here for? Isn't this too much torque for a Honda Wave? You know your shit. This motorbike used to be tricked out, not so much anymore. What about these? Those belong to the Suzuki sport. So where's your Suzuki sport now? You ever heard a story about the tiger hunter? There was a guy who hunted tigers in U Minh jungle. He told a lot of great stories. Usually they only go after male tigers and avoid females, especially when they guard their cubs. Female tigers, when their cubs are hungry, can get very aggressive. They don't care about anything but hunting for food. Sometimes, hunters track down the lair, with all the cubs. Hunters could easily take them all, but they're wise enough not to do so. Do you know why? Never mess with a tigress guarding her cubs. She will never forget it her entire life. She will go to the end of the world... just to kill the poor fucking bastard that took her cubs. A kid was abducted in Tan Phu district. The victim was a five-year-old girl, playing in front of her house. The Internet was recently stirred by photos and video showing scenes... I know your motorbike runs just fine. It's better to keep it that way. Let's go. I don't get it. Checkmate. Hey. Where are you going? Get lost. Hey, stop! Where you going? Mom. Help me! No. Boss, we'll have 30 kids, including these eight. This shipment is huge. But I'm afraid the cops... Stick with the plan. Switch the track at the right spot. But... Clean this up. They pissed everywhere. Look at that. Where's my daughter? Mai! Take me. Let my daughter go. Everything stays the same. 2:00 a.m. Train number VNR 053171. Meet me there. You are a kid in a martial art family. You have to protect yourself. Hey. Look at me. Do not blink, remember? Punch hard. Stand up. Stand up. No one will help you stand up in life. Stand up. Stand up. I'm the spring to my mom I'm the sunlight to my dad I learn new things at school Mai. Nurse. How long have I been out? Just take a rest. Wait till I finish these 800 forms. Speak only when you're asked. And don't die. Please tell me, how long have I been out? A couple of months. No, just a couple of hours. I can't stay here. I have to go. Stay there, you can't go yet. Nurse. I have to go, please. What are you doing? Hey! You don't understand. -I have to go now. -Calm down! Let me call the doctor. Just lie right there. Mr. Luong. Mr. Luong. Mr. Luong, she's awake. So cold for a handsome guy. So unfortunate. Why was it so hard for me to find you? Twice now. Le Minh Luong. You're the one in charge of my daughter's abduction case? And you're the one who burned down Ngoc Bich's club eight years ago? It was ten years ago. I bet you weren't a cop yet. You're wrong. I was the one who signed your release. What do you want now? Why are you keeping me here? You've messed things up enough. Stay here. Let the police solve this case. Mess things up? Do you understand? They kidnapped my daughter. I have to save her. You don't have the right to hold me here. My responsibility is to keep you and others safe. We suspect you are causing trouble for the authorities. And you have a lot of questions to answer. Causing trouble? Thanh Soi, Sau Theo and that whole gang are imprisoning children, including my daughter! Don't you understand? Don't you see? We're on the case. But there's no sign that your daughter was kidnapped. What do you mean? You came to Truc's house. You attacked him. And then you asked for an address. We found you when you almost got drowned out there. You have to be there, and see with your own eyes. I saw the children and I saw Mai. Do you understand? We were there... but there was nothing in that house. No kidnappers. No kids. No. I have to go now. I can't stay here. I have to go. Listen. The kids are safe. I know you are worried... but we're trying our best to help you. So, you should stay here. Until we can get more intel. -Please, I can't stay here any longer. -Stay right there. Yes, sir? Lie down. Calm down, don't go anywhere. Lie down. Slowly. Can't you see? You've messed it all up. Your name is Trang, right? Did they tell you why I almost died, and got admitted here? 'Cause you like to go to jail. Just now you must have overheard. They got my child. And will cut her up, probably... taking her organs to sell. I don't even know if she's alive. Do you have a daughter? No, I don't. I have sons. Your kids must be so happy... having a mom... who works hard, loves them, and takes care of them. Unlike me. I'm such a bad mother. I can't even protect her. That's why she got kidnapped. Okay. Do you watch American movies? On the ground! Close your eyes! -Don't be scared. -Freeze! Don't move, don't move. -Freeze. -Don't move. Phuong, calm down, we can handle this. What do you want? What do you want? -I want to rescue you. -I don't need you. Lie down! Please cooperate. If I succeed, we'll have good memories like in movies. Freeze. -Why are there so many cops? -Freeze! I don't know. What now? It's not how I imagined it. What now? -I'm going back in. -Stop. Freeze. Back off! Help, help me. Don't touch me. Help me! Tell my sons... I love them so much. Let her go. Make way! Thank you. Good luck. Brother. CERTIFICATE OF VOVINAM MASTER CERTIFICATE OF MERITS You hang out with those punks, come home and disrespect our family? From now on, you are not allowed to see them again. You hear me? You can't tell me what to do! I can love whoever I want. I will take the responsibility. How dare you talk to your father like that? Phuong! I think the train might have left already. Can you call Uncle Tam for help? Does he still work for the railroad company? Uncle Tam? He died last year. When our parents died, you were AWOL. Brother, Mai is everything to me. I have nowhere else to go. She might be better off having run away. She can be adopted by someone much better than you. Do you even know who her father is? Your niece was kidnapped, might be dead or being opened up, and you're talking like that? Your child is not born yet. You gotta be a good person. Shut up! Let me tell you something. You didn't want a good family. You left and became a gangster. How dare you come home and ask for help? Mai was kidnapped because of you. An immoral person like you should just die. Hell was made for people like you. That's right. I'm an ungrateful piece of shit. That's right. So what? I ran away. I didn't listen to Mom and Dad. I didn't have the guts to come home when they died. I'm a street woman, a ghetto gangster. A piece of trash. A bad mother. I have no pride left, so I've come to see you. Someone like me should just die. You'd love that, wouldn't you? Yes. I was wrong. Every night before I close my eyes, I felt regret for everything... that I've done. Even the fact that I was born. But I need to tell you this. Giving birth to Mai and becoming her mother... was the best thing I have ever done. I will bring her back. At any cost. Even if I have to die for it. I will destroy this gang. Just watch me! I'm sorry, Mai. I've followed this case for three years. It's an international operation, trailing from the Hai Van Pass to Ca Mau Province. They ship cargo from Quy Nhon, sometimes from Cam Ranh, Da Nang, all over the place. Then straight to Laos, and continue to other countries. We have agents everywhere along the way. If you know them so well, why haven't you just caught them all? It's not that easy. We need evidence to crack the whole operation. Not just a few coolers of organs, or a couple of kidnappings. They are not connected to each other. It's not enough. We can't let them know we're onto them. Why did you follow me? Because I know... a train just left Saigon ten minutes ago. We're in Binh Trieu. If you take a motorbike taxi now to the next stop, it'll take around 45 minutes. They're like octopuses. One tentacle's cut off, another one will grow. Children have been taken from their families. This is our chance to cut off all of their tentacles. And only you know the train number. What do you have to lose? 2:00 AM - SONG THAN STATION To all passengers, the train SE5 has just arrived at Song Than station. Before leaving the train, make sure to bring all your belongings. The train doors will open on the left. Please exit the station as instructed by operators. Thank you. Train number VNR 053171. Hold on. Calm down. What are you doing? -You can't do this alone. -My child is on there. She's everything to me. I live for her. I can't lose her now. Do you understand? I do. But it's too dangerous. -Let me call for backup. -Backup? I need to get on that train. If you wanna stop me, then shoot me now. If not, get out of my way. Hey! Go check. You go. Assholes. I have a good hand. Lazy bastards. Hai Phuong. You bitch. Remember my face! Rom, one more kilometer. Take positions. Yes, boss. Are you guys there yet? Yes, boss. Eight hundred meters to go. Get ready. Boss, we are at the joint. All set. Rom, stand by. 500 meters to go. Do you hear me? Rom. Where are you? Rom. Rom. Coi. Go check on Rom at the hitch. Okay, boss. You again? You're a stubborn shit, aren't you? Let's see how long you can take it this time. Boss, the train is approaching. We're waiting for your order. Switch it. Okay. Lock it. Our client is here. Prepare the shipment. You must embrace the pain. Learn to stand up on your own. Then you can fall. It's for your daughter? She can't use it anymore. You've done pretty good getting this far. But you've come to the wrong place. Get up. Good. There will always be a reward for those who overcome their fear. I might be in the wrong place... but you took the wrong kid. Mai. -Mom. -Mai. Mom. -Mai. -Help me, Mom. Mai. Mom. Are you okay? I'm okay. I was afraid I'd never see you again. I thought you couldn't make it in time. I have to make it in time... to tell you... that I love you so much. Do you know that, Mai? Mom, I didn't steal that wallet. Please believe me, Mom. I believe you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That was all my fault. Mom. I'm sorry, Mom. You taught me not to be scared. I have to try and be tough. Fear's just a feeling. But I was still scared. I'm not brave, am I, Mom? No, Mai, no. You are very brave. You were right. You have to be scared. You have to feel it. Only by overcoming your fear, can you be brave. You know that? And you did it. I told Ngoc the same thing. But she was still scared. Maybe you should bring her home. And other kids, too. Everyone is scared here. Who? Who are you talking about? Team One stay here on standby, the rest follow me. Roger that. This is for my brave daughter. Wait for me. Mom! Boss. Boss. Boss. Put your guns down. Clear the area. Check all the vehicles. Mom! Mom, what's wrong with you? Wake up, Mom. Don't leave me. Wake up, Mom! Please, wake up, Mom. Don't die. Mom! Don't leave me. Please, Mom, wake up. Mom. Mom. Wake up, Mom. I promise... I promise that I'll be brave. Stay with me, Mom.
